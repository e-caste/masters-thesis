00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.000
Prof: I do want to talk
about chords.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.675
Last time we worked through
this idea of the scale and how

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:14.550
you can build triads on each of
the members of the scale.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.687
And we talked about a triad
being a configuration of three

00:00:17.687 --> 00:00:20.990
pitches where you take the
first, the third and the fifth.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.054
The first of the triad--this is
a term that we'll be going over

00:00:25.054 --> 00:00:26.890
today--is called the what?
 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.730
The root of the triad so if we
have &gt;

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.800
C, E, G, the C is the root of
the triad.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.707
The lowest note of this
aggregate of three is the root

00:00:38.707 --> 00:00:39.530
of the triad.
 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.080
So we can build triads on each
of the members of the scale,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.511
and we said that some of these
chords tend to be used a lot

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:47.916
more than others,
that the tonic (I) is very

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:50.058
important,
the dominant (V) is important,

00:00:50.058 --> 00:00:52.658
the sub-dominant right next to
and below the dominant is

00:00:52.658 --> 00:00:54.806
important,
and we're going to be talking

00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:56.140
about the VI chord today.
 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.470
We could give that a name.
 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.612
We could call it the
sub-mediant but that's probably

00:00:59.612 --> 00:01:00.619
getting too technical.
 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:02.250
We'll just call it the VI chord.
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.968
So we've got a I chord built on
the first degree of the scale,

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:07.578
a V chord built on the fifth
degree of the scale,

00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:10.498
a IV chord built on the--a IV
chord built on the fourth

00:01:10.498 --> 00:01:12.870
degree,
and a VI chord built on the

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.819
sixth degree.
 

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:17.867
Now I had an interesting
discussion in section this past

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:21.989
week and a couple of really good
questions were asked.

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:23.665
I started by saying,
"Could you come up with

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:26.198
any kind of--
well, you tell me in fifty

00:01:26.198 --> 00:01:30.989
words or less what I said in
lecture yesterday about harmony.

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:32.290
How does harmony work?
 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.393
Can you come up with a visual
image of how harmony

00:01:35.393 --> 00:01:36.280
works?"
 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.910
So we tried out a couple of
things.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.503
One of the things that we
discussed was this type of

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:45.450
imagery here where you have
vertically these pillars,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.470
if you will,
or we could even call--

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.262
the more I sort of looked at
this--sort of call them tree

00:01:50.262 --> 00:01:51.060
trunks almost.
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.275
And these tree trunks were the
chords and at the base of each

00:01:55.275 --> 00:01:57.876
of these chords at least
conceptually,

00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:01.319
theoretically,
is this thing called the root.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.519
So I like this tree metaphor
here.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:08.826
So we've got the root here of
the--and then the trunk and then

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:11.933
up above, of course,
this florid canopy would

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:13.770
musically be the what?
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.840
The melody. Okay.
 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.860
So we might think about that.
 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.306
Now in the course of this,
a student asked a very good

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.030
question that I should have
pointed out a long time ago,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.717
and that is:
when an orchestra plays or an

00:02:25.717 --> 00:02:29.126
ensemble plays and they're
looking at their music and

00:02:29.126 --> 00:02:33.169
they're reading their music,
do they play a chord?

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:37.162
Does the violin play a chord
and are the trumpets--each

00:02:37.162 --> 00:02:41.819
trumpet playing a chord and the
viola--is it playing a chord?

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.378
What do you think?
 

00:02:43.378 --> 00:02:43.772
No.
 

00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:50.199
It's just playing one note--one
note of a chord.

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.950
And once again we,
our ears, hear this aggregate

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.697
of sound and then we say,
"Oh, it's got that,

00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:58.144
that, that, that,"
and we extrapolate out of that

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:00.360
information that it is this
particular chord.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.694
But if you were to look at what
the YSO has on its stands

00:03:04.694 --> 00:03:06.938
nobody's playing the chord.
 

00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:10.758
They're just playing individual
notes that all together form a

00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:11.258
chord.
 

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:14.028
And we pointed out,
however, that one individual

00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:16.873
has a--
the music that has all of these

00:03:16.873 --> 00:03:19.043
parts on it--
and that, of course,

00:03:19.043 --> 00:03:22.020
is the conductor who has the
full conducting score--

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.590
the full score--in front of him
or her.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.242
So that was one interesting
question that came up,

00:03:27.242 --> 00:03:30.383
so keep this in mind if you're
wondering about this idea of

00:03:30.383 --> 00:03:30.979
chords.
 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:32.949
So we could say this is the
root, maybe this is the third

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:33.758
and that's the fifth.
 

00:03:33.758 --> 00:03:37.573
These other instruments are
filling in these things at

00:03:37.573 --> 00:03:41.530
various spots to produce this
aggregate of the chord.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.390
Supposing this--we mentioned
this also, this idea--supposing

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.729
we had other things kind of
running around there.

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.514
Without those other things
running around we would have a

00:03:52.514 --> 00:03:56.639
good sort of model of homophonic
texture, sort of block chords

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.598
changing in that fashion.
 

00:03:58.598 --> 00:04:01.151
If you put in other little
strands of melody,

00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:03.878
it changes it more toward
polyphonic texture.

00:04:03.878 --> 00:04:07.419
Let's review another point and
I'll get to a second question

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.439
that was asked.
 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.938
Why do we have to change chords?
 

00:04:10.938 --> 00:04:14.598
We talked about this last time.
 

00:04:14.598 --> 00:04:17.550
Why do we change chords?
 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.410
Yeah.
 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.560
Student:
&gt;

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.819
Melody?
 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:23.807
Prof: Because the melody
changes and not all harmonies

00:04:23.807 --> 00:04:26.000
are concordant with every note.
 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.519
Someone asked me,
"Well, why are some notes

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:35.519
consonant and why are other
notes dissonant?"

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:38.774
And the answer has to do with
ratios and string sizes and

00:04:38.774 --> 00:04:41.100
lengths of pipe and things like
that,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.603
but generally speaking,
pitches that are right next to

00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:47.132
each other--
very close to each other--are

00:04:47.132 --> 00:04:47.740
dissonant.
 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.430
If you get a highly irrational
ratio like nine to eight,

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.043
which is the whole tone,
or seventeen or eighteen to

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:56.391
seventeen--
which, just depending upon your

00:04:56.391 --> 00:04:59.442
internal tuning,
is the half step--those

00:04:59.442 --> 00:05:02.959
irrational ratios are very
dissonant,

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:04.221
&gt;
 

00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:05.670
or &gt;
 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.177
that kind of sound,
but if you allow a little space

00:05:08.177 --> 00:05:10.805
in there--
Let's say you go to a

00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:14.470
three-to-two ratio or a
six-to-five--

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.709
even a six-to-five ratio,
it gets more consonant.

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:19.230
Let's see how this would play
out.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.786
Here for example we have the
pitch C and either note above or

00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:27.009
below it is dissonant.
 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.199
These are very close together.
 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.889
Now let's play this on the
piano.

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:30.480
So here is a C.
 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.541
&gt;
 

00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:33.586
If I play the D above it,
&gt;

00:05:33.586 --> 00:05:35.238
it's dissonant,
&gt;

00:05:35.238 --> 00:05:36.420
the D below it,
it's dissonant,

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.583
but let's say I go down to the
A below it, &lt;&lt;plays

00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:39.095
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:41.769
allowing a little separation
between the two pitches now.

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:42.916
&gt;
 

00:05:42.916 --> 00:05:43.596
What about that?
 

00:05:43.596 --> 00:05:44.660
Consonant or dissonant?
 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.738
Sounds a lot better.
 

00:05:45.738 --> 00:05:48.274
What about this,
now going down to the G against

00:05:48.274 --> 00:05:48.759
the C?
 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.089
&gt;
 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:52.440
Yeah, it sounds fine,
&gt;

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.228
sounds well,
kind of bland or revving in

00:05:55.228 --> 00:05:56.230
neutral there.
 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.589
What about this?
 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:58.870
&gt;
 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.206
Yeah, it sounds sort of nice.
 

00:06:00.206 --> 00:06:00.990
What about this?
 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.069
&gt;
 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.947
Yeah, not so much,
but if you think about it--so

00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:08.620
it's not that--if you--it's not
that we're allowing even more

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.540
space here.
 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.831
What we've done is taken this
pitch and played it all the way

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:16.180
down an octave below it so we're
actually getting back to this

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.870
configuration of the pitch right
next to it,

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.675
and we could--then of course we
could go down one more step

00:06:21.675 --> 00:06:23.079
&gt;
 

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:26.644
and we would get the octave,
which is a duplication of

00:06:26.644 --> 00:06:27.519
two-to-one.
 

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:31.889
So that's a very wide sort of
ratio there.

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:33.089
So that's something to think
about.

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:37.108
The closer these pitches are
together, the more likely they

00:06:37.108 --> 00:06:41.197
are to be dissonant--and the
desire to have some space added

00:06:41.197 --> 00:06:41.889
there.
 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.060
Questions about that?
 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.079
Okay.
 

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:49.139
Let's go on now to talk about
chord progression.

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.516
Anybody want to do--what's your
understanding of what a chord

00:06:51.516 --> 00:06:52.190
progression is?
 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.206
If I said "chord
progression"--I think we

00:06:54.206 --> 00:06:55.779
have that term up on the board
today.

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:59.279
What is a chord progression?
 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:01.819
I--let's see.
 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:02.944
Are you going to?
 

00:07:02.944 --> 00:07:03.274
Yeah.
 

00:07:03.274 --> 00:07:04.069
Fire away.
 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:06.620
Student:
&gt;

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.826
Prof: Nice and loud,
a little bit louder.

00:07:07.826 --> 00:07:08.290
I couldn't hear.
 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.838
Student: A sequence of
chords that sound good together?

00:07:09.838 --> 00:07:10.476
Prof: Okay.
 

00:07:10.476 --> 00:07:10.653
Good.
 

00:07:10.653 --> 00:07:11.079
Excellent.
 

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:13.264
A sequence of chords that sound
good together,

00:07:13.264 --> 00:07:16.490
kind of make sense together;
we could say that sort of march

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.259
along in a purposeful fashion.
 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:24.000
&gt;
 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.232
--that kind of make sense
together.

00:07:26.232 --> 00:07:27.019
All right?
 

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:30.266
They seem to be going somewhere
and there's this sort of force

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:33.249
of pull or gravity in music
having to do with some chords

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:35.060
wanting to go to other chords.
 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.550
So we've got a chord
progression.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.300
We've talked about the root of
the triad.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.339
&gt;
 

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:45.500
The root of the triad is the
bottom-most pitch of that triad.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.817
&gt;
 

00:07:46.817 --> 00:07:48.918
Supposing we didn't go
&gt;

00:07:48.918 --> 00:07:50.870
C, E, G, but we decided to
start with the

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.896
&gt;
 

00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:54.581
E, G and then put the C up on
top, &gt;

00:07:54.581 --> 00:07:55.509
C, E, G, C.
 

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:57.730
Well, that'd be what's called a
chord inversion.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.281
We're not going to get into
that 'cause that takes us into

00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:03.182
heavy-duty music theory,
but it's--if we don't have root

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:06.348
position then we've got some
other note of the triad in the

00:08:06.348 --> 00:08:08.624
bass,
and we've got some kind of

00:08:08.624 --> 00:08:12.312
chord inversion,
so that's what that particular

00:08:12.312 --> 00:08:14.028
term means up there.
 

00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:17.920
What are we going to do to hear
these chords?

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.240
How do we hear chord
progressions?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.000
How do we hear harmony?
 

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.509
What are we listening for again?
 

00:08:22.509 --> 00:08:26.709
Obviously, we've talked about
it again and again and again.

00:08:26.709 --> 00:08:29.406
We're going to be listening for
the bass.

00:08:29.406 --> 00:08:29.879
Okay?
 

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:32.424
And all of our musical
experience tells us to listen to

00:08:32.424 --> 00:08:34.037
melody;
melody's beautiful--that's what

00:08:34.037 --> 00:08:35.605
we want to hear,
but now to get a sense of

00:08:35.605 --> 00:08:37.330
harmony we're going to listen to
the bass.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.620
And we said last time we want
to do two things.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.672
We want to figure out if the
harmony is changing,

00:08:42.672 --> 00:08:46.360
and if it is changing whether
it's changing at a regular or

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.570
irregular rate.
 

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:52.048
By regular rate we mean that
the amount of time that each

00:08:52.048 --> 00:08:57.097
chord holds is exactly the same;
every chord holds for the same

00:08:57.097 --> 00:08:58.340
length of time.
 

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.510
If one chord holds twice as
long or only half as long,

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.918
then we have an irregular
harmonic change--irregular rate

00:09:06.918 --> 00:09:08.730
of harmonic change.
 

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.539
So let's begin with our first
example here this morning.

00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:13.058
It's from Richard Wagner.
 

00:09:13.058 --> 00:09:16.466
It's the beginning of his
Ring cycle and we're

00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:18.169
going to listen to this.
 

00:09:18.169 --> 00:09:19.149
Well, how do we hear the bass?
 

00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:22.178
How do we tell if the harmony
is changing?

00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:25.288
What I do is try to sing the
bass.

00:09:25.288 --> 00:09:27.720
I don't know whether it's
easier for gentlemen or not

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.870
because our voices are sort of
in the bass,

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.936
but maybe this is payback time
since ladies are always singing

00:09:32.936 --> 00:09:33.590
the melody.
 

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.629
So we'll focus on the bass and
we'll try to sing the bass,

00:09:37.629 --> 00:09:41.841
and if we find that in singing
the bass our voice is not

00:09:41.841 --> 00:09:44.657
changing,
probably the harmony hasn't

00:09:44.657 --> 00:09:45.288
changed.
 

00:09:45.288 --> 00:09:49.106
If we have to sing a different
pitch, then probably the harmony

00:09:49.106 --> 00:09:49.970
has changed.
 

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.029
So let's try that as an initial
modus operandi here and we'll

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:54.000
see how it works.
 

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.850
So here's an example from
Wagner.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.450
&gt;
 

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.298
See if you can find the pitch.
 

00:10:01.298 --> 00:10:02.360
Sing it.
 

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.809
I want to hear the sound.
 

00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:09.009
Louder, please.
 

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:33.960
&gt;
 

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.990
Did it change? No.
 

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.085
He just keeps that same E-flat
chord for about six minutes at

00:10:39.085 --> 00:10:41.820
the beginning of the Overture to
Rheingold,

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.395
and on the basis of that you
know there's going to be a very

00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:45.269
long opera.
 

00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:47.394
If he's going to sit there on
one chord for that amount of

00:10:47.394 --> 00:10:49.408
time, it's going to go on for a
long period of time.

00:10:49.408 --> 00:10:49.696
Okay.
 

00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:53.020
Let's listen to an example from
the realm of pop music this

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.480
time.
 

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.895
What about this one?
 

00:10:54.895 --> 00:10:56.029
Is it changing?
 

00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:59.090
I think this is Dave Matthews
Band.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.460
What about this one?
 

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.070
See if you can sing the pitch.
 

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:12.950
&gt;
 

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.279
Sing it.
 

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:24.778
&gt;
 

00:11:24.778 --> 00:11:26.447
What about that one?
 

00:11:26.447 --> 00:11:27.700
Did it change?
 

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.091
No.
 

00:11:28.091 --> 00:11:32.538
So that one didn't change
either.

00:11:32.538 --> 00:11:35.528
We're going to have some that
change, and we're going to work

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.820
through this progressively in
just a moment.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.279
I want to make one other point
before we launch into that,

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:45.408
and that is the following:
that composers use the rate of

00:11:45.408 --> 00:11:48.504
harmonic change--
whether it's changing or not

00:11:48.504 --> 00:11:50.440
changing--
to sort of make us feel

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.590
different ways about the music
that we are listening to.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:57.730
It gives a sense of what this
music is all--

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.840
really all about and since,
as we were saying,

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.192
so much classical music doesn't
have a text with it we've got to

00:12:04.192 --> 00:12:07.438
have some markers in there to
know what the composer is trying

00:12:07.438 --> 00:12:08.769
to communicate to us.
 

00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:13.899
Here's a famous example from
Mozart's G Minor Symphony.

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:26.389
&gt;
 

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:27.580
And so on.
 

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.072
So if I separated this noodling
here, &lt;&lt;plays

00:12:30.072 --> 00:12:30.820
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.743
which is just a kind of
arpeggio &lt;&lt;plays

00:12:35.743 --> 00:12:37.166
music&gt;&gt;
 

00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:43.620
patterning of the chord and
just have the chord stay there--

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.575
&gt;
 

00:12:46.575 --> 00:12:49.529
&gt;
 

00:12:49.529 --> 00:12:49.990
All right.
 

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.649
So those are the chords
underneath.

00:12:51.649 --> 00:12:53.899
You notice at the beginning
&gt;

00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:58.676
one-two, two-two,
three-two, four-two,

00:12:58.676 --> 00:13:03.840
one-two, two-two,
three-two, four-two.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.519
At the beginning &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:08.596
these chords are holding for
four measures or a total of

00:13:08.596 --> 00:13:09.379
eight beats.
 

00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:26.090
Then as it goes on,
&gt;

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.058
what happens here?
 

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:29.139
&gt;
 

00:13:29.139 --> 00:13:30.820
Change, change,
change, change--changing on

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.700
every beat--then &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.600
change, change,
change, change,

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.168
change.
 

00:13:35.168 --> 00:13:37.519
Then we're getting two changes
per beat.

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:40.980
So what's happened to the rate
of harmonic change here?

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.669
Is it regular or irregular?
 

00:13:42.669 --> 00:13:43.038
Students: Irregular.
 

00:13:43.038 --> 00:13:46.548
Prof: Highly irregular,
and what is happening to it?

00:13:46.548 --> 00:13:48.970
It's getting faster and faster
and faster.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.610
So here in the G Minor Symphony
we feel as--

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.779
oh, it's so full of tension,
angst,

00:13:55.779 --> 00:14:00.840
anxiety, perhaps passion,
it's driving somewhere,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.636
and one of the things that's
driving it is its accelerating

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:06.340
rate of harmonic change.
 

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.255
The amount of time that each
chord is holding is getting

00:14:09.255 --> 00:14:12.649
shorter and shorter and shorter
as we drive into that cadence.

00:14:12.649 --> 00:14:15.220
Now the cadence is
&gt;

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.503
--cadence is simply the end of
a musical phrase,

00:14:18.503 --> 00:14:22.414
particularly in this case the
end of a chord progression,

00:14:22.414 --> 00:14:25.139
where we are at a point of
arrival;

00:14:25.139 --> 00:14:27.870
the cadence brings us to a
point of arrival.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.908
So that's a piece of Mozart.
 

00:14:29.908 --> 00:14:32.177
Let's turn to a piece of
Beethoven now,

00:14:32.177 --> 00:14:35.519
his Symphony number Six,
the Pastoral Symphony.

00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:37.480
Let's listen to just a bit of
it.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:43.509
&gt;
 

00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:48.179
Can you pick out the bass?
 

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:59.029
Can you sing the bass pitch?
 

00:14:59.029 --> 00:15:00.889
Now we can.
 

00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:04.610
&gt;
 

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:05.693
Prof: Well,
it's difficult;

00:15:05.693 --> 00:15:06.220
it's not easy.
 

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.820
Can you pick out the--no.
 

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.950
I was having trouble picking
out the bass.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.634
They're so--sometimes you can
do it, and sometimes you can't

00:15:12.634 --> 00:15:13.000
do it.
 

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.948
We're going to focus now on
some passages where we can do

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:19.004
it, and we're going to see how
Beethoven is setting up some

00:15:19.004 --> 00:15:20.480
chord progressions here.
 

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.200
So here we've got--let's see.
 

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.149
We've got some chords set out
and we're going to--

00:15:27.149 --> 00:15:32.785
we've got some chords set out
here and we're in the key of C

00:15:32.785 --> 00:15:35.643
at this point,
and we're going to hear

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.831
Beethoven go to a tonic chord,
then a sub-dominant chord,

00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:42.418
then a tonic chord,
then a dominant chord and so on.

00:15:42.418 --> 00:15:45.327
We're just going to watch and
listen to--maybe even sing along

00:15:45.327 --> 00:15:47.139
with--the bass as he changes
chords.

00:15:47.139 --> 00:15:54.090
&gt;
 

00:15:54.090 --> 00:16:24.350
&gt;
 

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:30.027
And let's work--we'll hear that
again, but as you can see

00:16:30.027 --> 00:16:32.155
&gt;
 

00:16:32.155 --> 00:16:36.820
and then hold on that
&gt;

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.009
and then the changes came a
little bit faster and faster.

00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:41.538
So let's listen to that again.
 

00:16:41.538 --> 00:16:45.932
And we will then get over to
here, where he's sitting on the

00:16:45.932 --> 00:16:50.621
tonic chord, and we want to see
how long he's going to hold this

00:16:50.621 --> 00:16:51.514
tonic chord.
 

00:16:51.514 --> 00:16:52.259
Okay?
 

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:55.330
&gt;
 

00:16:55.330 --> 00:17:03.840
&gt;
 

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.753
Irregular, huh,
because we held a long time

00:17:06.753 --> 00:17:07.309
there.
 

00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:10.539
Now, moving faster.
 

00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:17.609
&gt;
 

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:18.920
Sing.
 

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.509
&gt;
 

00:17:20.509 --> 00:17:21.380
Sing with me.
 

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:36.980
&gt;
 

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.660
Okay.
 

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.376
So he's up to something here
with this rate of harmonic

00:17:41.376 --> 00:17:41.828
change.
 

00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:43.798
We almost fell asleep on that
tonic chord.

00:17:43.798 --> 00:17:47.000
He's doing the opposite of what
Mozart did.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.157
He's trying to relax us here by
slowing down the rate of

00:17:50.157 --> 00:17:51.480
harmonic change here.
 

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.920
That held for about thirty
seconds, that tonic chord.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.490
Almost all classical music
involves irregular rates of

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.855
harmonic change,
a point I think will become

00:18:00.855 --> 00:18:04.460
apparent later on,
but that is perhaps why this is

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.519
the Pastoral Symphony--
this idea of being relaxed,

00:18:08.519 --> 00:18:12.900
being outdoors among the--
amidst nature and being in a

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.960
very relaxed sort of state of
mind.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.848
The rate of harmonic change has
slowed down considerably here.

00:18:20.848 --> 00:18:21.490
Okay.
 

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:26.608
Now for the rest of the session
today,

00:18:26.608 --> 00:18:30.981
what I'd like to do is take
examples from the realm of pop

00:18:30.981 --> 00:18:35.815
music and use them as paradigms
for what happens in the world of

00:18:35.815 --> 00:18:37.349
classical music.
 

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:38.960
Why would I do that?
 

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.896
Why, when dealing with harmony
and bass lines,

00:18:41.896 --> 00:18:45.878
do I want to start by focusing
on popular music and then apply

00:18:45.878 --> 00:18:48.490
those principles to classical
music?

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.290
What does pop music do for us
that's very helpful?

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:52.990
Marcus?
 

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.470
Student: It's,
like, very regular.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.332
Prof: Okay.
 

00:18:55.332 --> 00:18:57.250
It's not like;
it is very regular,

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:57.730
Marcus.
 

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.048
I'm always telling my kids,
"Don't like"--no.

00:19:00.048 --> 00:19:03.103
It is indeed very
regular--So it is indeed very

00:19:03.103 --> 00:19:06.553
regular so that's one thing,
and by regular we mean these

00:19:06.553 --> 00:19:08.990
patterns keep repeating again
and again.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.230
So Marcus is absolutely right.
 

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.950
That's the big-ticket
item--it's regular.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.406
It oftentimes repeats and it
can be symmetrical in that

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:17.920
sense.
 

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.519
Another observation?
 

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:21.278
Roger?
 

00:19:21.278 --> 00:19:27.328
Student:
&gt;

00:19:27.328 --> 00:19:28.236
Prof: Okay.
 

00:19:28.236 --> 00:19:28.488
Yeah.
 

00:19:28.488 --> 00:19:29.950
It's--that's another point.
 

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:33.717
It's more obvious because there
are probably fewer lines there,

00:19:33.717 --> 00:19:36.209
so that you can focus on the
primary line,

00:19:36.209 --> 00:19:38.031
the basic line--the bass line.
 

00:19:38.031 --> 00:19:38.640
Yeah.
 

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.140
So there's--it's probably
simpler in that sense.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.670
Any other observations?
 

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.019
Well, here's one other that you
might not have thought of,

00:19:48.019 --> 00:19:52.383
and that is that most of the
chords in rock music in

00:19:52.383 --> 00:19:56.318
particular tend to be
root-position chords,

00:19:56.318 --> 00:19:59.630
and for that reason they're
easier to hear.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.170
When you start getting
inversion, "what note is

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.960
it, what chord is it,"
that obfuscates the issue.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.513
So because so much popular
music and particularly rock

00:20:08.513 --> 00:20:12.605
music has those chords in root
position we can track them more

00:20:12.605 --> 00:20:13.410
readily.
 

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.538
And then finally we could add
that--

00:20:15.538 --> 00:20:19.487
the idea that maybe with a lot
of electronic basses and things

00:20:19.487 --> 00:20:23.249
like that that they play--
they tend to play the bass just

00:20:23.249 --> 00:20:23.689
louder.
 

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:24.130
Okay?
 

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.463
So all of these factors,
particularly the idea of

00:20:27.463 --> 00:20:29.410
regularity and repetition.
 

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:36.549
So let's take a couple of
examples here.

00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:39.890
Okay. I think we have something.
 

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.450
I've chosen something called
Badly Drawn Boy.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.640
I had this in my collection.
 

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.500
Anybody ever heard of this?
 

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.086
Is--okay.
 

00:20:47.086 --> 00:20:47.674
One, two.
 

00:20:47.674 --> 00:20:49.440
This is not--okay,
three.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.111
So this is--is that--is it
"Badly Drawn Boys"

00:20:52.111 --> 00:20:53.150
or "Boy"?
 

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.279
Boy. What? Singular. Okay.
 

00:20:56.279 --> 00:20:58.890
We're going to hear just a few
seconds of this.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:02.846
See if you can determine how
many chords we have

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:06.130
here--whether we have a chord
change.

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.493
If so, how many chords are
involved in this chord change

00:21:09.493 --> 00:21:12.859
and are they changing at a
regular or irregular rate?

00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:38.619
&gt;
 

00:21:38.619 --> 00:21:39.769
What about that?
 

00:21:39.769 --> 00:21:42.640
Regular or irregular?
 

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.088
Student: Is it regular?
 

00:21:43.088 --> 00:21:44.320
Prof: Regular,
yeah.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.410
&gt;
 

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.098
And then we go on to the next
one.

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:49.210
And how many chords were
involved there?

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.598
Difference of opinion.
 

00:21:51.598 --> 00:22:02.279
So how many--well,
let's hear it again.

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:13.250
&gt;
 

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:23.210
&gt;
 

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.690
So two, yeah. Regular?
 

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.308
Student:
&gt;

00:22:27.308 --> 00:22:29.503
Prof: So we have just
two chords here,

00:22:29.503 --> 00:22:31.650
just changing back and forth
between two.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:36.950
Here is another example:
Justin Timberlake.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.250
Sorry, but it's a good example.
 

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.329
Let's listen to this.
 

00:22:40.329 --> 00:22:41.799
How many chords are involved?
 

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:44.339
Regular or irregular?
 

00:22:44.339 --> 00:23:08.900
&gt;
 

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.150
&gt;
 

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.740
Regular or irregular?
 

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.500
Hmm?
 

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.920
How many think regular?
 

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.338
Raise your right hand.
 

00:23:19.338 --> 00:23:21.460
Raise your left hand if you
think it's irregular.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.029
Yeah, it's regular,
and with-- each chord was

00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:26.660
holding for two beats there in
duple meter.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.308
How many chords were there
altogether?

00:23:28.308 --> 00:23:32.480
Yeah, I think there were four
chords there so we had change.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.460
Yes, there was change.
 

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.950
It was regular and it happened
to involve four chords.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:37.259
Okay.
 

00:23:37.259 --> 00:23:40.298
Pop music--we've been using
some pop music here.

00:23:40.298 --> 00:23:43.460
We've talked about why we use
the pop music.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.825
Let's talk about what the
difference between pop and

00:23:45.825 --> 00:23:46.798
classical music is.
 

00:23:46.798 --> 00:23:51.057
We've touched on this a little
bit before but let's play with

00:23:51.057 --> 00:23:51.980
this again.
 

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.788
Let's say you go home for
Thanksgiving break and your

00:23:54.788 --> 00:23:57.327
grandmother says,
"What have you been doing

00:23:57.327 --> 00:23:58.298
at Yale?"
 

00:23:58.298 --> 00:24:00.182
"Well, I've been taking
this course on music and we've

00:24:00.182 --> 00:24:02.065
been studying classical music
and some popular music,"

00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:03.704
and she says,
"What's the difference?

00:24:03.704 --> 00:24:04.006
Tell me.
 

00:24:04.006 --> 00:24:06.116
What's the difference between
popular music and classical

00:24:06.116 --> 00:24:06.720
music?"
 

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.358
How would you explain to your
grandmother what the difference

00:24:09.358 --> 00:24:09.578
is?
 

00:24:09.578 --> 00:24:12.981
Maybe six, seven,
eight different bullet points

00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:13.500
here.
 

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.410
Who can get us started?
 

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.588
We've talked about some of
these already,

00:24:18.588 --> 00:24:21.740
having to do with the nature of
the harmony--

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.420
that pop music tends to have
simpler harmonies,

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.308
and that those harmonies tend
to be more repetitious,

00:24:28.308 --> 00:24:33.105
that they tend to have
harmonies that have chords in

00:24:33.105 --> 00:24:34.608
root position.
 

00:24:34.608 --> 00:24:37.678
And here is one other thing you
might not think of and then I'm

00:24:37.678 --> 00:24:40.500
going to stop and I'm going to
let you add things here.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.821
They tend to be just triads
whereas in classical music

00:24:43.821 --> 00:24:45.640
&gt;
 

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.045
we can have a triad but we can
also add a seventh note with

00:24:48.045 --> 00:24:49.000
&gt;
 

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.640
one, three, five,
seven, nine,

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.279
eleven, that kind of thing.
 

00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:01.228
It gets more dissonant,
the more notes that you add

00:25:01.228 --> 00:25:01.700
there.
 

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.730
So classical music does involve
more complex chords.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:11.609
Okay. What else here?
 

00:25:11.609 --> 00:25:14.230
Oscar.
 

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.259
Student: Pop music tends
to have a vocal part?

00:25:16.259 --> 00:25:18.539
Prof: Pop music tends to
have a vocal part.

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:20.298
Why?
 

00:25:20.298 --> 00:25:24.630
Student: Maybe it wants
to be popular.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.390
Prof: Well,
because it wants to be popular.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.118
&gt;
 

00:25:28.118 --> 00:25:30.348
There may be a circular
argument there.

00:25:30.348 --> 00:25:33.115
Well, okay, but if you're going
to have a singer,

00:25:33.115 --> 00:25:35.480
what's that singer going to be
singing?

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.220
Student: A melody.
 

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.509
Prof: A melody?
 

00:25:38.509 --> 00:25:41.608
Well, but classical music has
melody.

00:25:41.608 --> 00:25:44.118
We have a violinist play a
melody.

00:25:44.118 --> 00:25:47.646
If we have a singer,
the singer's going to be

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:49.009
singing a text.
 

00:25:49.009 --> 00:25:49.301
Right?
 

00:25:49.301 --> 00:25:52.029
And we talked about this
before--that classical music,

00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:54.058
probably eighty-five percent of
it,

00:25:54.058 --> 00:25:57.518
does not involve a text,
and that's a whole different

00:25:57.518 --> 00:26:01.308
ballgame because then you have
to communicate meaning in a

00:26:01.308 --> 00:26:03.769
completely different sort of
way.

00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:07.545
Maybe you communicate meaning
by slowing down your harmonic

00:26:07.545 --> 00:26:11.190
motion to make us feel relaxed
so that each of these--

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:14.412
with pop music you have--you
know what the thing means

00:26:14.412 --> 00:26:18.314
principally because of the text,
but with the classical music

00:26:18.314 --> 00:26:21.798
you've got these sort of
subliminal symbols in there,

00:26:21.798 --> 00:26:25.160
subliminal signifiers that we
got to pick up on.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.858
And we'll be talking more and
more about that.

00:26:26.858 --> 00:26:29.175
So we do have--that's a very
important point that Oscar

00:26:29.175 --> 00:26:29.818
raises there.
 

00:26:29.818 --> 00:26:34.605
We've got text in pop music
that tells us what this music

00:26:34.605 --> 00:26:35.289
means.
 

00:26:35.289 --> 00:26:37.480
Anything else?
 

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:42.170
Carolyn.
 

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:48.000
Student:
&gt;

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.012
Prof: Okay.
 

00:26:49.012 --> 00:26:51.548
If you go to hear a symphony of
mid-Beethoven,

00:26:51.548 --> 00:26:54.759
on-- each movement will
probably last fifteen minutes.

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:57.556
If you put on a CD,
we could have-- what's the

00:26:57.556 --> 00:27:01.286
timing on the Justin Timberlake
thing there or any one of the

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:01.970
tracks?
 

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:03.839
Pick up the "Duke of
Earl" one there.

00:27:03.839 --> 00:27:05.910
Do they give us timings?
 

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:06.198
Okay.
 

00:27:06.198 --> 00:27:09.025
I can't read it but two minutes
and fifty seconds,

00:27:09.025 --> 00:27:12.372
two minutes--this one's only
two minutes, three minutes and

00:27:12.372 --> 00:27:14.680
twenty seconds,
that kind of thing.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.940
They're short,
whereas Beethoven,

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.130
as mentioned,
is much longer.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:23.640
What does that opportunity of
length provide us?

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:28.089
It provides us the opportunity
to be more diversified in terms

00:27:28.089 --> 00:27:30.058
of the mood of the music.
 

00:27:30.058 --> 00:27:35.000
So in classical music you can
have rather wide mood swings.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.618
Remember we had in that one
piece &lt;&lt;plays

00:27:38.618 --> 00:27:39.798
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:27:39.798 --> 00:27:43.259
and then &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:27:43.259 --> 00:27:45.729
there was a modulation tying
them together,

00:27:45.729 --> 00:27:48.608
but those were completely
different sentiments.

00:27:48.608 --> 00:27:52.654
Usually, with a piece of
popular music you get a single

00:27:52.654 --> 00:27:54.756
ethos,
a single feeling,

00:27:54.756 --> 00:27:58.279
a single mood associated with
the piece,

00:27:58.279 --> 00:28:01.358
and the piece will tend to be
shorter.

00:28:01.358 --> 00:28:04.276
Any more that we could push on
that?

00:28:04.276 --> 00:28:04.858
Yeah.
 

00:28:04.858 --> 00:28:08.369
Student:
&gt;

00:28:08.369 --> 00:28:10.700
Prof: Okay. That's--yeah.
 

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.380
Most classical music is written
down.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.838
We've talked--we spent a lot of
time talking about that--

00:28:13.838 --> 00:28:16.548
the most popular music,
virtually all of it--

00:28:16.548 --> 00:28:19.038
although after the fact people
try to write it down.

00:28:19.038 --> 00:28:23.390
You can go buy a score of the
Beatles,

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:27.201
for example--although they
didn't design this initially

00:28:27.201 --> 00:28:29.484
with music,
but after the fact,

00:28:29.484 --> 00:28:32.690
people sort of listen to it and
make written--

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:36.215
put in written form what had
originally been just an aurally

00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:38.069
conceived artistic statement.
 

00:28:38.069 --> 00:28:40.038
Anything else? Roger?
 

00:28:40.038 --> 00:28:46.190
Student:
&gt;

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:47.063
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:28:47.063 --> 00:28:50.220
Oh, so we've got the difference
between acoustical instruments,

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.945
which are sort of natural wood
and strings and that sort of

00:28:52.945 --> 00:28:55.039
thing,
and electronically amplified

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:58.262
sound in which it might be sent
to a mixer or perhaps a

00:28:58.262 --> 00:29:01.903
synthesizer that could play with
those partials that we talked

00:29:01.903 --> 00:29:03.490
about,
and maybe turn a

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.595
clarinet--somebody playing at a
keyboard and you want that

00:29:06.595 --> 00:29:08.608
keyboard to sound like a
trumpet,

00:29:08.608 --> 00:29:11.353
well, you just turn a mixing
board and you can get those

00:29:11.353 --> 00:29:13.048
pitches to sound like a trumpet.
 

00:29:13.048 --> 00:29:15.159
Or, for example,
let's say you're Cher and

00:29:15.159 --> 00:29:18.400
you're getting in to your early
sixties and you really can't hit

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.731
that high note anymore;
you can get electronically that

00:29:21.731 --> 00:29:23.798
particular sound to be enhanced.
 

00:29:23.798 --> 00:29:25.470
And let's say you can't hold
that.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.817
Let's say Pavarotti at the end
of his life couldn't hold notes

00:29:28.817 --> 00:29:31.672
as long as he could when he was
recording in nineteen

00:29:31.672 --> 00:29:32.660
seventy-eight.
 

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.567
Well, you can just--an engineer
will just sit there and isolate

00:29:35.567 --> 00:29:38.334
that second of sound and then
give a "times three"

00:29:38.334 --> 00:29:40.210
command and "boom,"
well,

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:42.009
look at Pavarotti hold out that
note.

00:29:42.009 --> 00:29:45.588
Well, it's the miracle of the
engineer and not the singer.

00:29:45.588 --> 00:29:49.107
So there are a lot of
acoustical things and sort of

00:29:49.107 --> 00:29:52.486
tricks of synthetic things going
on in pop music.

00:29:52.486 --> 00:29:53.118
Yeah.
 

00:29:53.118 --> 00:29:56.392
Student: Well,
not just the chord progression

00:29:56.392 --> 00:29:58.828
but also the structure of the
piece.

00:29:58.828 --> 00:30:02.279
Like in popular music there's
often a couple of verses and a

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:05.906
chorus and a bridge and you can
predict each different movement

00:30:05.906 --> 00:30:10.019
of the piece,
and that's more regular than--

00:30:10.019 --> 00:30:11.650
Prof: Couldn't say it
better myself.

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:14.568
Say that nice and loud so
everyone can hear it.

00:30:14.568 --> 00:30:18.430
Student: The structure
of a popular piece is often more

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.038
predictable in pattern and
verses and bridges and choruses

00:30:22.038 --> 00:30:25.961
whereas with classical music you
really can't predict what part

00:30:25.961 --> 00:30:29.569
of the movement you're at as
well as you can with--

00:30:29.569 --> 00:30:30.710
Prof: Right. Exactly.
 

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.538
It's not --and that ties in
with the harmony also,

00:30:33.538 --> 00:30:35.788
which is also a lot more
predictable.

00:30:35.788 --> 00:30:38.288
And so generally speaking what
we end up with classical

00:30:38.288 --> 00:30:39.910
music-it's much more
diversified.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:40.970
It's much more varied.
 

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.220
It's much more complex.
 

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.630
We've got contrapuntal lines
operating in it.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:48.029
It has the capacity for
expansion.

00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:52.595
It can take us through the full
panoply of human emotions within

00:30:52.595 --> 00:30:54.769
one particular composition..
 

00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:58.025
And it perhaps allows the
opportunity for more personal

00:30:58.025 --> 00:31:00.757
interpretation,
"exactly what does this

00:31:00.757 --> 00:31:03.640
music mean,"
more personal interpretation,

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.730
because we're not tied to a
text;

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.961
we're not linked in to a
particular text that tells us

00:31:07.961 --> 00:31:08.720
what it's about.
 

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.660
So those are just a few ideas
as we pursue this.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.753
Well, what I'd like to do now
is move here to a couple of

00:31:16.753 --> 00:31:19.912
additional pieces,
and we're going to use an

00:31:19.912 --> 00:31:24.000
example of pop music now with a
three-chord chord progression.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.364
We've heard I guess it was
Badly Drawn Boy--Boys there with

00:31:27.364 --> 00:31:29.220
a two-chord chord progression.
 

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.769
Now we're going to hear Beach
Boys, I guess,

00:31:31.769 --> 00:31:35.092
with a three-chord chord
progression and it's going to be

00:31:35.092 --> 00:31:36.930
sub-dominant (IV),
dominant (V),

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:37.880
tonic (I).
 

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.210
Is it regular or irregular?
 

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:47.799
&gt;
 

00:31:47.799 --> 00:31:48.809
And try to sing the bass.
 

00:31:48.809 --> 00:32:05.980
 
 

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.480
Can you sing that bass?
 

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.390
You sing it for me.
 

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:09.539
Here's the tonic.
 

00:32:09.539 --> 00:32:10.369
&gt;
 

00:32:10.369 --> 00:32:13.420
&gt;
 

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.140
Good.
 

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.069
Good. Louder. That's it.
 

00:32:17.069 --> 00:32:19.230
&gt;
 

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.458
Okay.
 

00:32:19.458 --> 00:32:21.652
So that's all you got to do,
and you can hear the

00:32:21.652 --> 00:32:22.750
&gt;
 

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:25.657
holding for twice as long as
the other, so you got irregular

00:32:25.657 --> 00:32:26.940
rate of harmonic change.
 

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.480
So that's I, IV, V, I.
 

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:34.420
And let's go to a little bit
more of Beethoven.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.021
We're going to go now to the
last movement of his

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:39.477
Pastoral Symphony,
and I keep hitting on the

00:32:39.477 --> 00:32:41.240
Pastoral Symphony 'cause
in two weeks--

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.858
or maybe three weeks--we're
going to go hear,

00:32:43.858 --> 00:32:46.917
I guess, the Saybrook Orchestra
play the Pastoral

00:32:46.917 --> 00:32:47.529
Symphony.
 

00:32:47.529 --> 00:32:50.083
So I'm spending a little extra
time on the Pastoral

00:32:50.083 --> 00:32:50.798
Symphony here.
 

00:32:50.798 --> 00:32:53.868
And the last movement opens
with this sort of sound.

00:32:53.868 --> 00:32:59.500
We have these pitches
&gt;

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.513
and all listen and then you can
tell me what instrument is

00:33:03.513 --> 00:33:04.430
playing it.
 

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.461
So we have those sorts of
sounds &lt;&lt;plays

00:33:06.461 --> 00:33:07.140
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.903
and then another instrument
will come in with &lt;&lt;plays

00:33:09.903 --> 00:33:10.619
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:33:10.619 --> 00:33:12.940
and play that.
 

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.246
It's all--these are all notes
of a C triad,

00:33:15.246 --> 00:33:16.509
&gt;
 

00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:27.278
C, E, G, C, E,
all notes of a C triad.

00:33:27.278 --> 00:33:30.336
Now we happen to be in the key
of F here so that means he's

00:33:30.336 --> 00:33:34.165
starting out with the dominant,
which gets us to the point that

00:33:34.165 --> 00:33:37.910
all pieces have to end in the
tonic one way or another,

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.920
but not all pieces begin with
the tonic.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.318
So this one happens to begin
with a sort of dominant chord.

00:33:42.318 --> 00:33:44.720
So this is a little bit of
dominant preparation.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.779
&gt;
 

00:33:47.779 --> 00:33:50.009
So tell me what instruments are
playing here.

00:33:50.009 --> 00:34:07.400
&gt;
 

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.159
And then the strings come in.
 

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:12.760
So what was the first
instrument?

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.480
Anybody pick that up,
on that one playing?

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.121
On the quiz or test next week
or--on Thursday--we'll give you

00:34:18.121 --> 00:34:19.822
three--at least three plays.
 

00:34:19.822 --> 00:34:20.429
Robert?
 

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:20.960
Student: Clarinet.
 

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.010
Prof: Clarinet.
 

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.208
Yes, it was a clarinet up
there, nice and high,

00:34:24.208 --> 00:34:26.742
and then another instrument
came in with &lt;&lt;plays

00:34:26.742 --> 00:34:27.650
piano&gt;&gt;.
 

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.210
What instrument was that?
 

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:34.954
French horn,
yeah, but notice that if we

00:34:34.954 --> 00:34:41.159
take this aggregate--
&gt;

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:44.289
and we're back to that same
idea of the octave,

00:34:44.289 --> 00:34:45.670
the fifth, the fourth and the
third,

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:48.280
sort of, so it's again sort of
primordial,

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.789
this particular acoustical
basis of so much of music.

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:54.543
So that's our dominant
preparation and then the melody

00:34:54.543 --> 00:34:56.309
starts, so let's listen to this.
 

00:34:56.309 --> 00:34:57.659
Let me play it here a little
bit.

00:34:57.659 --> 00:35:09.360
&gt;
 

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.280
So it has a kind of
antecedent-consequent phrase

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.121
structure with the &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:35:13.121 --> 00:35:13.530
chord.
 

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.905
Once we get up there,
that's sort of the end of the

00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:18.139
antecedent phrase and we have a
chord change.

00:35:18.139 --> 00:35:20.300
What we're working with here
are the same chords.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.110
We've sort of gone from the
Beach Boys to Beethoven here.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.699
We've got the same chords
operating.

00:35:25.699 --> 00:35:28.130
It's going to be a I chord,
then a IV chord,

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.280
and we'll drop down to the IV
chord.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.590
Then we'll come to a V chord,
to a I chord,

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.077
to a IV chord,
to a V chord,

00:35:34.077 --> 00:35:36.443
to a I chord,
just as we were doing with the

00:35:36.443 --> 00:35:37.380
Beach Boys.
 

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:47.179
 
 

00:35:47.179 --> 00:35:48.690
We'll resuscitate Beethoven
here.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.469
&gt;
 

00:35:50.469 --> 00:35:53.110
How many of you have ever heard
this before, while Lynda's

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:53.989
getting this set?
 

00:35:53.989 --> 00:35:56.181
Let's see if we could sing it
together because we're going to

00:35:56.181 --> 00:35:57.679
do this in a different way in a
second.

00:35:57.679 --> 00:36:13.449
Let's sing &gt;
 

00:36:13.449 --> 00:36:15.369
Okay. So let's sing this.
 

00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:20.505
That's the melody and we're
going to sing

00:36:20.505 --> 00:36:23.460
&gt;
 

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.365
beneath--we're going to sing
Beethoven's bass beneath

00:36:26.365 --> 00:36:27.539
Beethoven's melody.
 

00:36:27.539 --> 00:36:31.280
&gt;
 

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:31.614
Okay.
 

00:36:31.614 --> 00:36:32.820
This is the intro.
 

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.625
That's fine.
 

00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:35.099
We'll listen to it.
 

00:36:35.099 --> 00:36:37.179
Here comes the horn.
 

00:36:37.179 --> 00:36:45.880
&gt;
 

00:36:45.880 --> 00:37:33.949
&gt;
 

00:37:33.949 --> 00:37:35.619
Okay.
 

00:37:35.619 --> 00:37:39.030
So that's an example of a
classical composer,

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:41.659
admittedly in a pretty
straightforward situation,

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:45.188
using the same three-chord
chord progressions we find in

00:37:45.188 --> 00:37:46.280
the Beach Boys.
 

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.570
Let's enlarge this further.
 

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.420
Let's move to a four-chord
chord progression.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.340
We're going to switch the board.
 

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:56.170
 
 

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.186
And we're going to go to the
kind of music that I grew up

00:37:59.186 --> 00:38:00.050
with as a kid.
 

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.766
It's always fun.
 

00:38:00.766 --> 00:38:03.141
This is Gene Chandler and the
"Duke of Earl"

00:38:03.141 --> 00:38:05.875
so we're going to listen to a
little bit of it and we're going

00:38:05.875 --> 00:38:07.130
to chart the bass here.
 

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.858
I'm trying to remember.
 

00:38:07.858 --> 00:38:09.510
I think actually it's in the
same key as Beethoven.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:18.980
&gt;
 

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.356
And then we'll see exactly what
it is that he's doing here so

00:38:21.356 --> 00:38:23.099
we're going to try to lock in on
the bass.

00:38:23.099 --> 00:38:24.050
Here we go.
 

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:27.050
&gt;
 

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:35.340
&gt;
 

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.800
So sing the bass with me.
 

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:56.590
&gt;
 

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.829
So we've got four chords
operating here and they're

00:38:59.829 --> 00:39:01.190
changing regularly.
 

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:02.550
What are those four chords?
 

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.768
Well, we talked a little bit
about this before.

00:39:04.768 --> 00:39:08.521
Now we have what's called a VI
chord and we're not moving

00:39:08.521 --> 00:39:12.101
directly to the IV chord;
we're moving to another

00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:16.110
chord--here a VI chord,
&gt;

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.230
which happens to be a minor
chord.

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.300
&gt;
 

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.949
There's the IV chord
&gt;

00:39:21.949 --> 00:39:23.380
and there's [V}-- &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.789
back to the I here.
 

00:39:24.789 --> 00:39:26.820
So you sing this nice and loud
for me, please.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:27.681
&gt;
 

00:39:27.681 --> 00:39:28.460
There's the tonic.
 

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.389
Ready, go.
 

00:39:29.389 --> 00:39:30.800
&gt;
 

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.010
&gt;
 

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:35.079
Good.
 

00:39:35.079 --> 00:39:38.059
One more time.
 

00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:40.099
&gt; Louder.
 

00:39:40.099 --> 00:39:44.980
&gt;
 

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.018
&gt;
 

00:39:45.018 --> 00:39:45.422
Okay.
 

00:39:45.422 --> 00:39:49.371
Now watch what happens as we
continue with this I,

00:39:49.371 --> 00:39:51.630
VI, IV, V, I progression.
 

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.909
Do we have a regular or
irregular rate of change here?

00:39:54.909 --> 00:39:56.440
Let's go on to the next section.
 

00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.909
&gt;
 

00:40:00.909 --> 00:40:17.510
&gt;
 

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:35.619
I, VI, IV, V, I, VI, IV, V.
 

00:40:35.619 --> 00:40:40.389
So what happened in that middle
section?

00:40:40.389 --> 00:40:41.820
Yeah.
 

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.550
Student:
&gt;

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.090
Prof: Good. Yeah.
 

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:52.800
If we are &gt;
 

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.896
and then it went on and on and
on, longer, longer,

00:40:54.896 --> 00:40:56.610
longer, and then
&gt;

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.579
but it was the same pattern.
 

00:40:58.579 --> 00:41:03.322
They just elongated each
measure by its same amount so we

00:41:03.322 --> 00:41:06.710
had harmony changing on each
measure,

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.956
and then in that middle section
each chord was changing at the

00:41:09.956 --> 00:41:11.179
rate of two measures.
 

00:41:11.179 --> 00:41:13.994
So the whole piece,
then, would be a piece

00:41:13.994 --> 00:41:17.840
involving irregular rate of
change-- the entire piece.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.201
Okay.
 

00:41:18.201 --> 00:41:21.813
So that's the "Duke of
Earl" progression:

00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:23.909
the basic I,
VI, IV, V, I.

00:41:23.909 --> 00:41:28.429
Now we'll play a passage of
Mozart--a symphony by Mozart

00:41:28.429 --> 00:41:32.949
here that he wrote at the ripe
old age of nine years.

00:41:32.949 --> 00:41:36.260
This is Mozart at age nine.
 

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.485
He had actually written a
couple of symphonies by this

00:41:38.485 --> 00:41:38.780
time.
 

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.494
This is his Symphony No.
 

00:41:40.494 --> 00:41:43.139
5 in B-flat so let's listen to
this.

00:41:43.139 --> 00:41:46.811
We're just going to listen and
see if anything strikes you as

00:41:46.811 --> 00:41:47.670
interesting.
 

00:41:47.670 --> 00:42:18.679
&gt;
 

00:42:18.679 --> 00:42:21.315
I think we just should keep
right on going just to get the

00:42:21.315 --> 00:42:22.010
point across.
 

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:23.610
We'll just let it run.
 

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:27.800
 
 

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.400
&gt;
 

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.409
So you can sing this bass.
 

00:42:34.409 --> 00:42:43.018
&gt;
 

00:42:43.018 --> 00:42:46.721
So that's Mozart using the
"Duke of Earl"

00:42:46.721 --> 00:42:48.349
harmony--not really.
 

00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:50.409
This is a point I brought up in
my section the other day.

00:42:50.409 --> 00:42:53.923
There are lots of legal cases
where people try to sue somebody

00:42:53.923 --> 00:42:56.516
else for stealing a song;
they try to sue them for

00:42:56.516 --> 00:42:58.460
stealing a bass line or
something like that.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.170
You can get away--you can sue
people for stealing melody.

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:04.351
You can never--there's a strong
legal precedent for not being

00:43:04.351 --> 00:43:06.579
able to make a claim about
stolen bass,

00:43:06.579 --> 00:43:09.199
because these basses are
limited in number,

00:43:09.199 --> 00:43:11.760
they involve rather simple
harmonic progressions,

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.518
and they've been used over the
centuries.

00:43:13.518 --> 00:43:15.478
It's not as if Gene Chandler
sat around here studying Mozart

00:43:15.478 --> 00:43:15.909
symphonies.
 

00:43:15.909 --> 00:43:16.449
I don't know.
 

00:43:16.449 --> 00:43:17.612
Maybe he did,
said, "Oh,

00:43:17.612 --> 00:43:19.110
I like that harmonic
progression.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:19.840
I'm going to use that
here."

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:19.992
No.
 

00:43:19.992 --> 00:43:22.898
Everybody's been using that,
sort of since time immemorial

00:43:22.898 --> 00:43:25.090
or at least since the sixteenth
century.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:31.050
Now let's go on here to listen
to some music of Rossini--

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:34.510
composer Gioachino Rossini--
coming after Mozart,

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:37.110
and he likes chord progressions
too,

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:41.016
so we're going to listen to a
passage of Rossini and see what

00:43:41.016 --> 00:43:43.619
he does by way of his chord
selection.

00:43:43.619 --> 00:43:46.514
So the point of this is:
once you get these kind of

00:43:46.514 --> 00:43:48.599
progressions locked in your
ears,

00:43:48.599 --> 00:43:53.367
you go to a concert and you can
begin to chart what the piece is

00:43:53.367 --> 00:43:55.789
doing in terms of its harmony.
 

00:43:55.789 --> 00:43:58.376
Yeah, you're not going to be
able to hear all of it and,

00:43:58.376 --> 00:44:00.679
indeed, you may not be able to
hear most of it.

00:44:00.679 --> 00:44:01.989
I don't hear most of it.
 

00:44:01.989 --> 00:44:03.818
But there are moments,
and they're moments that give

00:44:03.818 --> 00:44:05.110
me pleasure
&gt;

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:06.233
when I can say,
"Oh, yeah.

00:44:06.233 --> 00:44:07.619
That's what he's doing
there."

00:44:07.619 --> 00:44:09.480
I might not know what key he's
in.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.476
I don't really care what key
he's in 'cause I don't have

00:44:11.476 --> 00:44:13.643
absolute pitch,
but I can find well,

00:44:13.643 --> 00:44:17.052
maybe it's a I,
VI, IV, V, I chord progression

00:44:17.052 --> 00:44:20.309
or a I, V, I progression or I,
IV, V, I.

00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:22.940
We--you get different kinds of
patterns.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:26.699
A Pachelbel bass pattern is
another one.

00:44:26.699 --> 00:44:30.306
So let's listen to a pattern
that Rossini is using here in

00:44:30.306 --> 00:44:31.699
this opera overture.
 

00:44:31.699 --> 00:44:34.079
&gt;
 

00:44:34.079 --> 00:44:38.250
So the first thing we got to do
is sort of lock on to the tonic.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:42.630
&gt;
 

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:46.329
&gt;
 

00:44:46.329 --> 00:44:48.320
And it's taking me a while.
 

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.710
It's taking me a while to lock
on to that tonic.

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:52.407
I don't know.
 

00:44:52.407 --> 00:44:55.039
The bass isn't as loud as in
some of the pop music

00:44:55.039 --> 00:44:56.329
&gt;
 

00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:58.789
but I think it--
&gt;

00:44:58.789 --> 00:45:01.070
but I think that's what the
tonic is.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:04.456
So don't be--don't despair if
you don't initially land on the

00:45:04.456 --> 00:45:05.190
tonic here.
 

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.409
It takes a while so--but I
think we've got it identified.

00:45:07.409 --> 00:45:08.159
&gt;
 

00:45:08.159 --> 00:45:09.659
All right. Let's go on.
 

00:45:09.659 --> 00:45:13.639
&gt;
 

00:45:13.639 --> 00:45:20.268
&gt;
 

00:45:20.268 --> 00:45:24.139
So he went
&gt;.

00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:25.869
What would you guess those two
chords are?

00:45:25.869 --> 00:45:27.239
We said this is the tonic.
 

00:45:27.239 --> 00:45:28.230
&gt;
 

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:31.570
The other one's probably going
to be the dominant.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:33.708
If you ever hear music rocking
back and forth repeatedly

00:45:33.708 --> 00:45:35.226
between two chords,
it's probably tonic,

00:45:35.226 --> 00:45:36.199
&gt;
 

00:45:36.199 --> 00:45:37.320
dominant, tonic, dominant.
 

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:38.860
Remember we had that even with
the Strauss.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.010
&gt;
 

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.862
The timpani played that tonic,
dominant, tonic,

00:45:42.862 --> 00:45:43.989
dominant, tonic,
dominant.

00:45:43.989 --> 00:45:46.286
So if you hear two chords
rocking, it's probably tonic and

00:45:46.286 --> 00:45:46.730
dominant.
 

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:47.047
Okay.
 

00:45:47.047 --> 00:45:49.840
Let's see how he expands this a
little bit.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:56.510
&gt;
 

00:45:56.510 --> 00:46:03.360
&gt;
 

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.739
So what was that?
 

00:46:04.739 --> 00:46:07.713
Well, that's the "Duke of
Earl" passage.

00:46:07.713 --> 00:46:08.199
Right?
 

00:46:08.199 --> 00:46:09.724
So we are sitting there in
Woolsey Hall with New Haven

00:46:09.724 --> 00:46:11.050
Symphony or whatever,
New York Philharmonic.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:11.557
"Oh, yeah.
 

00:46:11.557 --> 00:46:12.949
That's the 'Duke of Earl'
passage."

00:46:12.949 --> 00:46:16.867
So yes, it was the
&gt;

00:46:16.867 --> 00:46:19.480
I, VI, IV, V,
I progression.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.010
All right.
 

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.550
Let's see what happens next.
 

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:26.440
&gt;
 

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:26.780
Okay.
 

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:30.873
So what happened next was he
then started to run that faster,

00:46:30.873 --> 00:46:32.510
&gt;
 

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:34.918
twice as fast as it had been
before, changing rate of

00:46:34.918 --> 00:46:35.800
harmonic pattern.
 

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.010
Okay?
 

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:44.170
&gt;
 

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:49.429
What was that
&gt;?

00:46:49.429 --> 00:46:51.360
What chord's there probably?
 

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.750
Daniel, what do you think?
 

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:55.590
What chord's there?
 

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:56.400
Student: Dominant.
 

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.686
Prof: Just dominant
time, &gt;

00:46:59.686 --> 00:47:02.849
, going faster and faster,
and then what happens?

00:47:02.849 --> 00:47:05.719
&gt;
 

00:47:05.719 --> 00:47:07.969
Sing the tonic.
 

00:47:07.969 --> 00:47:15.409
&gt;
 

00:47:15.409 --> 00:47:17.329
The end of that was all just
the tonic.

00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:18.710
He just sat there on the tonic
forever.

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:22.233
It's a good example of sort of
real time and psychological time

00:47:22.233 --> 00:47:22.860
in music.
 

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.382
You knew it was time to start
clapping as soon as that chord

00:47:25.382 --> 00:47:27.050
hit that, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:28.322
it stopped going back and
forth, tonic,

00:47:28.322 --> 00:47:29.360
dominant, just sitting there.
 

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.460
That piece is over.
 

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.443
The rest is just a big mud pie
in your face.

00:47:33.443 --> 00:47:33.929
Okay?
 

00:47:33.929 --> 00:47:35.599
It's just &gt;
 

00:47:35.599 --> 00:47:38.615
tonic or maybe throwing an
anchor overboard to bring this

00:47:38.615 --> 00:47:40.914
ship to an end--
whatever sort of analogy or

00:47:40.914 --> 00:47:42.849
visual imagine you want to bring
to it,

00:47:42.849 --> 00:47:45.860
but it's--the piece has ended.
 

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.000
Even though we are continuing
to hear sound,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.443
harmonically,
psychologically,

00:47:49.443 --> 00:47:52.530
we know we're finished when he
hits that particular tonic.

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:54.340
Okay. I think our time is up.
 

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.768
I'll see you Wednesday evening.
 

00:47:55.768 --> 00:47:59.836
And look for an e-mail early
this afternoon about individual

00:47:59.836 --> 00:48:01.630
help tomorrow afternoon.
 

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:07.000

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.677
Professor John
Rogers: Traditionally in

00:00:05.677 --> 00:00:08.561
Renaissance literature,
the muses -- and this will be

00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:11.722
familiar to many of you -- the
muses are thought to be the

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:14.495
daughters of Memory,
and the nine muses up on Mount

00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:17.767
Helicon -- that's where the
muses are believed to have lived

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.262
-- are the offspring of the
goddess of memory,

00:00:20.262 --> 00:00:22.980
whose name in the Greek is
Mnemosyne.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.177
Mnemosyne, whose name is
spelled with some difficulty,

00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:30.900
is spelled on the lower part of
your handout.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.207
Now, there's an important
reason for this genealogy,

00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:37.644
the idea that the muses are the
daughter of Mnemosyne,

00:00:37.644 --> 00:00:40.787
the goddess of memory.
In the Renaissance,

00:00:40.787 --> 00:00:44.852
the most potent source of
poetic inspiration was often

00:00:44.852 --> 00:00:47.920
believed to be the poet's own
memory,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.058
the degree to which the poet
could call up,

00:00:52.058 --> 00:00:56.886
just out of sheer recall,
literary topoi or

00:00:56.886 --> 00:01:02.600
commonplaces stored in his or
her memory from a lifetime of

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.184
reading.
Milton himself,

00:01:05.184 --> 00:01:09.680
and this seems to be true,
is said to have had one of the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.293
most capacious,
one of the largest memories in

00:01:13.293 --> 00:01:17.391
English letters.
This is the effect that we get,

00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:22.214
I think, from reading Milton --
is this notion that he seems to

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:26.492
have had one of the largest
memories imaginable and that

00:01:26.492 --> 00:01:30.070
he's remembered just about
everything he's ever

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.893
read.Now we know that Milton
was blind probably well before

00:01:34.893 --> 00:01:39.250
the time he began writing
Paradise Lost,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.335
 and therefore,
of course, he was then unable

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:45.095
to read.
Even though there were people,

00:01:45.095 --> 00:01:48.257
mostly young men,
willing and able to read to

00:01:48.257 --> 00:01:50.087
him,
it's clear that the vast

00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:53.460
quantity of learning that gets
poured -- all of that erudition

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.889
that gets poured into the pages
of Paradise Lost -- it's

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:00.318
clear that this is not a product
of Milton's last-minute review

00:02:00.318 --> 00:02:04.966
of the classics.
This learning springs from the

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:10.345
recesses of Milton's memory.
I take this to be an undeniable

00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:14.576
fact, but this is easy for us to
say -- it's easy for us to say

00:02:14.576 --> 00:02:18.738
that it's Milton's memory which
is the fount of so much of the

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:22.704
poem's erudition.
It's easy for us to say that it

00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:26.839
was Milton's memory that
facilitated his grasp of the

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:31.053
Christian and the classical
traditions.But I think

00:02:31.053 --> 00:02:35.585
Milton would probably feel a
little uncomfortable with our

00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:40.037
easy attribution of so much of
the poem's learning to his

00:02:40.037 --> 00:02:43.316
memory.
That's because to suggest --

00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:47.544
just think of it -- to suggest
that Milton is relying on his

00:02:47.544 --> 00:02:51.699
memory as he composes so
allusively and so dependently,

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:54.634
in a lot of ways,
so much of Paradise Lost --

00:02:54.634 --> 00:02:58.629
to say that is simply to say
that the poem has been generated

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.934
by Milton and not by God.
Milton has expended,

00:03:01.934 --> 00:03:06.418
we know, a considerable amount
of energy in establishing what

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:08.636
he wants us,
I am assuming,

00:03:08.636 --> 00:03:12.710
to believe is the divine
authority behind the poem.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.894
This poem, Milton tells us
again and again,

00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:19.760
has been authorized by that
same Holy Spirit who had

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.400
inspired Moses to write the Book
of Genesis.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.505
And so in order to make an
extraordinary claim for divine

00:03:27.505 --> 00:03:30.584
authorization,
Milton has to defend against

00:03:30.584 --> 00:03:34.030
this notion that I just began
this lecture with:

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.429
the idea that memory is on some
level really at the source of

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:42.461
Milton's poetic inspiration
because to rely on memory is

00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:47.960
simply in some sense is to admit
that this is just one more epic.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.135
It's to admit that this is in
fact a late epic and that it

00:03:52.135 --> 00:03:55.723
derives from a close,
studious, student-like

00:03:55.723 --> 00:04:01.089
imitation of the great epics of
Homer and Virgil.Now you'll

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:05.936
remember from our discussion of
the opening invocation to

00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:11.043
Paradise Lost,
that insistent bid that

00:04:11.043 --> 00:04:15.789
Milton was making:
the bid to be first.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:18.785
His adventurous song is one
that "with no middle flight

00:04:18.785 --> 00:04:21.170
intends to soar / above th'
Aonian Mount,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.771
while it pursues things
unattempted yet in Prose or

00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:28.615
Rhyme."
And so it was with such pride

00:04:28.615 --> 00:04:32.855
that he declared that this poem
was going to soar above all of

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:37.840
its classical predecessors,
but the category [laughs]

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.670
"Prose or Rhyme" is a large
one.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.133
It covers just about
everything, I would have to say,

00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:48.329
and the literary spectrum from
prose to rhyme,

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:52.180
of course, would have to
include the Bible as well.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.000
There's even the suggestion
here that Milton will be

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.269
pursuing things unattempted yet
even in holy scripture.

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:04.025
That is an extraordinary claim
for the poem's

00:05:04.025 --> 00:05:08.890
originality.But it's a
difficult claim because even as

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.845
Milton makes this claim,
he manages to undermine its

00:05:14.845 --> 00:05:17.513
force.
Merritt Hughes usefully notes

00:05:17.513 --> 00:05:20.639
this in one of the notes at the
bottom of the page,

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.540
that Milton in that line,
"things unattempted yet in

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.898
Prose or Rhyme," Milton's
actually alluding to the opening

00:05:28.898 --> 00:05:33.471
of another romance epic.
This is the Orlando Furioso

00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:37.198
by the great
sixteenth-century Italian poet

00:05:37.198 --> 00:05:39.329
Ariosto.
What is happening?

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:42.213
[laughs]
Milton had borrowed this claim

00:05:42.213 --> 00:05:45.762
for an absolute originality.
He's taken it from somebody

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.589
else, and in doing so I think
he's doing this deliberately;

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:54.471
he's exposing some of the
darker ironies behind his own

00:05:54.471 --> 00:05:58.265
literary ambition.
It's a good sort of question

00:05:58.265 --> 00:06:00.977
that gets raised in such a
problematic allusion:

00:06:00.977 --> 00:06:04.267
how do you set out to write an
original poem within such a

00:06:04.267 --> 00:06:06.459
conventional genre like the
epic?

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:10.323
What does it mean to be
inspired to write by the

00:06:10.323 --> 00:06:13.529
Christian Holy Spirit when your
epic,

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:17.850
in fact, just imitates a whole
array of classical pagan

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.698
conventions?
How can you write an original

00:06:20.698 --> 00:06:23.737
poem when your literary
consciousness is essentially

00:06:23.737 --> 00:06:27.014
made up of the memory of all the
things that you've read

00:06:27.014 --> 00:06:30.530
before?This is what I'll be
proposing over the course of

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.033
this lecture:
that memory is a problem that

00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:36.430
Paradise Lost is
continually confronting.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.541
So much of the pathos of
Satan's fallen condition

00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:45.595
involves his painful memory of
that blissful state in heaven

00:06:45.595 --> 00:06:49.891
from which he had fallen.
The problem of memory is just

00:06:49.891 --> 00:06:52.890
as important to the
psychological dynamics of the

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.698
fall of Adam and Eve,
but as we will see when we look

00:06:56.698 --> 00:06:59.899
at Book Four,
surely it's the problem of the

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:04.589
poet's memory that's the most
troubling in Paradise Lost.

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:09.081
Milton's own faculty of
memory -- this is the idea that

00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:14.269
I'm going to be floating here --
seems to provide something like,

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:17.238
or pose a stumbling block or an
obstacle for,

00:07:17.238 --> 00:07:19.600
his attempt to write an
original,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.125
divinely inspired poem.
I want to suggest in this

00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:26.592
lecture something that will
initially sound,

00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:29.602
I assume,
like a peculiar formulation:

00:07:29.602 --> 00:07:33.907
there's a strange way in which
Milton has to imagine himself

00:07:33.907 --> 00:07:37.920
losing his memory if he's
actually going to open himself

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.859
up to the muses' inspiration and
the inspiration of the

00:07:41.859 --> 00:07:44.560
Christian,
the heavenly, muse.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.918
There's a sense in which Milton
will have to forget everything

00:07:47.918 --> 00:07:51.425
he's learned up to this point.
There are some important signs,

00:07:51.425 --> 00:07:54.577
I think, especially in the
first two books of Paradise

00:07:54.577 --> 00:07:58.068
Lost of what we can think of
as Milton's -- it's a literary

00:07:58.068 --> 00:08:00.861
fantasy,
a literary fantasy of

00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:06.260
forgetfulness.As you may
well have gleaned from your

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.071
reading,
the first books of the poem are

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:11.920
particularly absorbed with the
idea of forgetting,

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.640
because more than any other
part of Paradise Lost

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.142
they display so
ostentatiously the remarkable

00:08:19.142 --> 00:08:23.674
scope of Milton's own memory.
These books are without

00:08:23.674 --> 00:08:28.940
question more heavily allusive
than any other books in the

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.595
epic.
They are steeped in the entire

00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:34.661
literary tradition of the
underworld journey that

00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:38.556
stretches from The Odyssey
of Homer up through Virgil's

00:08:38.556 --> 00:08:41.192
Aeneid,
 and of course up

00:08:41.192 --> 00:08:43.919
through all of the Renaissance
romance epics.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.991
And it's important to remember
that Milton will -- this is

00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:54.441
probably an invariable truth,
but I'll qualify it nonetheless

00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:59.476
-- that Milton will typically
imitate his predecessors only

00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:03.364
with a difference.
He usually takes pains (for

00:09:03.364 --> 00:09:08.182
example, in his great depiction
of hell in Books One and Two) to

00:09:08.182 --> 00:09:13.000
avoid the standard epic scenes
of the torture of the damned,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.915
for example,
with which we're familiar if

00:09:15.915 --> 00:09:19.049
we've read Homer or Virgil or,
of course,

00:09:19.049 --> 00:09:24.399
Dante much later.There are
nonetheless a few details from

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:29.749
the classical underworld that he
seems to have lifted more or

00:09:29.749 --> 00:09:35.187
less wholesale and one of them
-- I'm going to ask you to look

00:09:35.187 --> 00:09:40.270
at page 246 in the Hughes.
This is line 582 of Book

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:44.795
Two.
One of these little details

00:09:44.795 --> 00:09:52.218
that Milton has lifted rather
directly is that of the river

00:09:52.218 --> 00:09:55.465
Lethe,
the river of oblivion that was

00:09:55.465 --> 00:09:57.980
believed to flow in the
underworld.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.719
It's a river that,
I think, all classical writers,

00:10:00.719 --> 00:10:03.682
and a lot of Renaissance
writers, are very comfortable

00:10:03.682 --> 00:10:06.718
placing in the underworld.
So this is Book Two,

00:10:06.718 --> 00:10:10.329
line 582, Milton:
Far off from these a slow

00:10:10.329 --> 00:10:13.965
and silent stream,
Lethe the River of

00:10:13.965 --> 00:10:17.717
Oblivion rolls Her wat'ry
Labyrinth, whereof who

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:22.500
drinks,Forthwith his former
state and being forgets,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.340
Forgets both joy and
grief, pleasure and pain.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.779
So in this context,
the river of oblivion serves an

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:34.769
obvious purpose in the context
we have here in Book Two.

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:38.696
To drink from this river would
allow the fallen angels to

00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:42.447
forget their fallen state,
to forget the fact of their

00:10:42.447 --> 00:10:46.090
fallen-ness from their more
blissful former condition.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.138
On some level,
forgetfulness would just ease

00:10:49.138 --> 00:10:52.753
the grievousness of this
miserable new psychological

00:10:52.753 --> 00:10:57.220
dynamic with which they are
tormented.But there's also,

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.603
I think, a deeper sense in
which Milton himself might want

00:11:02.603 --> 00:11:06.759
to drink from this slow and
silent stream.

00:11:06.759 --> 00:11:12.628
If Milton could silence -- see
what you think of this -- all of

00:11:12.628 --> 00:11:16.788
his literary memories,
perhaps he could better

00:11:16.788 --> 00:11:21.633
guarantee his fresh intake of
inspiration from the Christian

00:11:21.633 --> 00:11:23.950
heavenly muse.
It's a fantasy,

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.203
of course, because no such
brainwashing is going to be

00:11:27.203 --> 00:11:30.743
possible,
just as the fallen angels -- if

00:11:30.743 --> 00:11:36.350
you look at line 607 -- will be
barred from drinking their fill

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.840
of the river Lethe,
forgetfulness is impossible.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.133
The fallen angels, they: 
…

00:11:42.133 --> 00:11:44.089
wish and struggle,
as they pass,

00:11:44.089 --> 00:11:47.496
to reachThe tempting
stream, with one small drop to

00:11:47.496 --> 00:11:50.840
loseIn sweet forgetfulness
all pain and woe,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.308
All in one moment,
and so near the brink;But

00:11:55.308 --> 00:11:58.200
Fate withstands,
and to oppose th'

and of it self the water

00:12:07.835 --> 00:12:12.110
wight, as once it fledThe
lip of Tantalus.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.952
It's an amazing passage because
in a lot of ways,

00:12:14.952 --> 00:12:18.210
I think, Milton is actually
directly enacting for us,

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.629
the reader, the impossibility
of such sweet forgetfulness.

00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:26.436
As soon as he describes the
impossibility of forgetting,

00:12:26.436 --> 00:12:30.590
a flood of classical figures
pours into his own narration.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:35.182
They pour with such a force,
I think, that Milton permits --

00:12:35.182 --> 00:12:39.853
I think this is a significant
rift that fissures or fractures

00:12:39.853 --> 00:12:44.289
the otherwise seamless text that
we have in Book Two.

00:12:44.289 --> 00:12:47.510
I'm convinced that there's
something very strange going

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.268
on.Standing in the Lethe of
Milton's hell is none other than

00:12:51.268 --> 00:12:54.873
the classical figure,
the figure from classical

00:12:54.873 --> 00:12:57.289
mythology, Medusa.
You know Medusa.

00:12:57.289 --> 00:13:01.600
She has the power with her
snaky locks to turn men into

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.309
stone, and so this seems to be
unique -- I don't know of any

00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:10.220
predecessor that Milton had for
this: Medusa,

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.948
having been placed by Milton in
the river Lethe,

00:13:12.948 --> 00:13:15.384
in the Christian underworld,
can prevent,

00:13:15.384 --> 00:13:18.565
of course, the fallen angels
from drinking the waters of

00:13:18.565 --> 00:13:20.940
oblivion.
Such is her power.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.243
But we have every right to ask
what Medusa -- this is a figure

00:13:25.243 --> 00:13:29.335
from Greek mythology -- what
Medusa is doing in a Christian

00:13:29.335 --> 00:13:31.546
hell.
There are, of course,

00:13:31.546 --> 00:13:36.051
dozens of figures taken from
the texts of classical mythology

00:13:36.051 --> 00:13:40.029
who are alluded to throughout
the first two books,

00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:44.558
but invariably they appear,
just as Tantalus does in this

00:13:44.558 --> 00:13:48.360
very passage,
within the context of a simile.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.860
They're not actually present in
the real world of Milton's hell,

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.440
or if it's a pagan god who's
mentioned,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.045
Milton will tell us that the
pagan god was just an early

00:14:01.045 --> 00:14:04.783
manifestation of one of the
fallen angels.But at least

00:14:04.783 --> 00:14:07.929
within the context of the
present narration,

00:14:07.929 --> 00:14:11.541
the figures mentioned in
Milton's hell are all former

00:14:11.541 --> 00:14:14.179
inhabitants of the Christian
heaven.

00:14:14.179 --> 00:14:16.829
And the fallen angels
themselves -- Satan,

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:19.736
Moloch, Belial,
Mammon, and Beelzebub -- these

00:14:19.736 --> 00:14:23.161
are all demons who were drawn
from the Judeo-Christian

00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:27.371
tradition of demonology.
They've been clearly been

00:14:27.371 --> 00:14:31.460
hurled into hell by a
Judeo-Christian deity.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.068
So this little moment,
this Medusa moment,

00:14:34.068 --> 00:14:36.740
we can call it,
is really quite strange.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:41.212
In the midst of all of the
Judeo-Christian realism,

00:14:41.212 --> 00:14:45.953
we have standing here a
decidedly pagan -- and I think

00:14:45.953 --> 00:14:51.409
this is not uninteresting -- a
decidedly female presence.

00:14:51.409 --> 00:14:56.603
You'll correct me if I'm wrong,
but I think I'm right to insist

00:14:56.603 --> 00:15:01.461
that this is a unique phenomenon
in these books.I think

00:15:01.461 --> 00:15:05.650
there's actually a reason for
this aberration.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:09.953
Medusa can turn men into stone.
She subjects them to that

00:15:09.953 --> 00:15:13.766
posture of absolute paralysis
that we've seen represented in a

00:15:13.766 --> 00:15:17.485
number of the early poems.
The Lady, the Lady in Milton's

00:15:17.485 --> 00:15:20.597
mask, was stuck to her seat in
the presence of the

00:15:20.597 --> 00:15:24.587
Shakespearian magician Comus,
and Milton himself had claimed

00:15:24.587 --> 00:15:28.371
in the poem "On Shakespeare"
that Shakespeare "dost make us

00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:30.720
Marble with too much
conceiving."

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.173
Shakespeare can turn us to
marble because he can fill our

00:15:34.173 --> 00:15:37.256
imaginations and leave us
incapable of thinking for

00:15:37.256 --> 00:15:40.218
ourselves,
incapable of maneuvering

00:15:40.218 --> 00:15:43.539
around, or moving around,
on our own.

00:15:43.539 --> 00:15:47.723
I think it's possible to see
Medusa here as an emblem or some

00:15:47.723 --> 00:15:51.210
sort of figure for a similarly
paralyzing power.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:55.529
You could think of Medusa as
Milton's counter-muse.

00:15:55.529 --> 00:15:59.599
If Milton's true muse,
or so he hopes or so he wants

00:15:59.599 --> 00:16:02.551
us to believe,
has a Christian origin,

00:16:02.551 --> 00:16:06.940
then this counter-muse is
unquestionably classical.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.484
She's a daughter of Mnemosyne,
the goddess of memory,

00:16:10.484 --> 00:16:14.164
and she represents that force
that prevents Milton from

00:16:14.164 --> 00:16:18.390
forgetting all of the pagan and
all of the classical literature

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.592
that,
of course, he had spent so much

00:16:21.592 --> 00:16:26.259
of his life reading.Now I
asked you to read for today,

00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:28.657
and I'm hoping you remember
some of the reading,

00:16:28.657 --> 00:16:31.157
the canto from Spenser's
Faerie Queene that

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:35.149
features the cave of Mammon.
The cave of Mammon is the home

00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:39.397
of Mammon, the money god,
who stores in his cave all of

00:16:39.397 --> 00:16:44.273
the wealth and all of the honor
that human beings spend so much

00:16:44.273 --> 00:16:48.233
energy striving for.
Now Spenser's hero in Book Two

00:16:48.233 --> 00:16:51.822
of the Faerie Queene is
Sir Guyon, and Sir Guyon

00:16:51.822 --> 00:16:55.875
descends into Mammon's Cave --
it's a Spenserian underworld --

00:16:55.875 --> 00:16:59.863
and it's in Mammon's Cave that
he is tempted by the money god

00:16:59.863 --> 00:17:02.434
himself.
This little bit of the

00:17:02.434 --> 00:17:06.013
Faerie Queene is
important for Milton in all

00:17:06.013 --> 00:17:09.122
sorts of ways.
It's first of all a depiction

00:17:09.122 --> 00:17:12.190
of an underworld,
and so it provides Milton with

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.519
an important Christian
representation of a hell.

00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:18.887
In that respect,
it has a kind of priority over

00:17:18.887 --> 00:17:22.619
the hells or the underworlds of
Homer and Virgil.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:25.889
It also provides Milton with
the figure of Mammon who will,

00:17:25.889 --> 00:17:29.609
as you will see over the course
of this semester become -- well,

00:17:29.609 --> 00:17:33.295
here in Paradise Lost
he's one of the key fallen

00:17:33.295 --> 00:17:36.729
angels in Milton's hell.
Mammon actually seems to

00:17:36.729 --> 00:17:41.016
represent the Miltonic position,
or that position in the debate

00:17:41.016 --> 00:17:45.234
in hell that seems to resemble
most closely Milton's own moral

00:17:45.234 --> 00:17:47.700
temperament,
we could say;

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.673
and you'll see at the end of
this semester that Spenser's

00:17:50.673 --> 00:17:53.805
cave of Mammon canto is even
more central to Milton's sequel

00:17:53.805 --> 00:17:56.993
to Paradise Lost,
which is Paradise

00:17:56.993 --> 00:18:01.378
Regained, which in many ways
is a more or less close

00:18:01.378 --> 00:18:06.002
rewriting of Spenser's story
with Satan playing the role of

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:09.829
Mammon and Christ in the role of
Sir Guyon,

00:18:09.829 --> 00:18:15.880
the hero.Now you also may
remember that we have already

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.680
run into Spenser's Mammon before
this point,

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.093
before Paradise Lost.
Mammon had surfaced -- I'm

00:18:25.093 --> 00:18:30.470
testing your memories here -- in
the text of Areopagitica.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:34.451
Because this is one of the most
famous passages in the treatise,

00:18:34.451 --> 00:18:37.801
and it's not one that we
actually looked at for Mammon

00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:40.652
himself,
I'm going to ask you to turn to

00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:44.533
Areopagitica.
This is page 728 in the

00:18:44.533 --> 00:18:48.380
Hughes, the right-hand
column.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.176
This is where Milton began to
consider the problem of

00:18:51.176 --> 00:18:53.381
temptation that,
of course, will become so

00:18:53.381 --> 00:18:56.248
important to Paradise Lost.
Here though,

00:18:56.248 --> 00:19:00.011
Milton is talking about the
temptation of reading classical

00:19:00.011 --> 00:19:02.196
literature.
This is an argument that we've

00:19:02.196 --> 00:19:04.552
examined before.
Read everything you can,

00:19:04.552 --> 00:19:07.272
Milton insists,
because only then can you

00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:11.421
overcome what he thinks of and
characterizes as the temptation

00:19:11.421 --> 00:19:15.651
of reading.
So in the right-hand column of

00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:18.128
728:
I cannot praise a

00:19:18.128 --> 00:19:22.950
fugitive and cloistered virtue,
unexercised and unbreathed,

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.506
that never sallies out and sees
her adversary,

00:19:25.506 --> 00:19:28.687
but slinks out of the race
where that immortal garland is

00:19:28.687 --> 00:19:31.700
to be run for,
not without dust and heat.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.920
[I'm going to skip a couple
lines here.]

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.721
…
[W]hich was the reason why our

00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:41.260
sage and serious poet Spenser,
whom I dare be known to think a

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.723
better teacher than Scotus or
Aquinas [Scotus and Aquinas are

00:19:45.723 --> 00:19:49.294
medieval philosophers]
describing true temperance

00:19:49.294 --> 00:19:53.392
under the person of Guion,
brings him in with his palmer

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:56.789
through the cave of Mammon,
and the bower of earthly bliss,

00:19:56.789 --> 00:20:02.109
that he might see and know,
and yet abstain.

00:20:02.109 --> 00:20:05.364
Spenser's cave of Mammon is
central to Milton's

00:20:05.364 --> 00:20:09.609
understanding of the Christian's
resistance of temptation,

00:20:09.609 --> 00:20:12.577
the temptation posed in
Areopagitica by

00:20:12.577 --> 00:20:15.609
scandalous and seemingly
non-virtuous books.

00:20:15.609 --> 00:20:19.398
Spenser, Milton argues here,
knows the importance of reading

00:20:19.398 --> 00:20:21.710
everything, the Miltonic
position.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.889
However evil those books are in
and of themselves,

00:20:24.889 --> 00:20:28.587
we have to read them so that we
might see and know and yet

00:20:28.587 --> 00:20:32.740
abstain.Now this passage is
famous for a lot of reasons,

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.690
not least of which is that it's
wonderful.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.403
It's juicy evidence that
provides for Milton's intense

00:20:39.403 --> 00:20:43.607
fondness for -- we might even
think of it as a passion for --

00:20:43.607 --> 00:20:47.500
this earlier English poet.
The passage is also famous

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.288
because in it Milton does
something that he almost never

00:20:51.288 --> 00:20:54.080
does.
Milton has made a mistake.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.800
John Milton has made a mistake.
He's made a literary mistake

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.519
and, as I think all editors
know, Spenser does not.

00:21:02.519 --> 00:21:06.055
Edmund Spenser in the Faerie
Queene does not bring Sir

00:21:06.055 --> 00:21:09.059
Guyon with his palmer through
the cave of Mammon.

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:13.410
Guyon descends in to the cave
of Mammon by himself.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.449
The palmer has been Guyon's
guide up to this point,

00:21:16.449 --> 00:21:19.359
his teacher.
The palmer accompanies him on

00:21:19.359 --> 00:21:23.620
all of his adventures but this
one, and Spenser in stanza two

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.526
of this canto makes a big deal
of the fact that Guyon is

00:21:27.526 --> 00:21:31.220
descending in to the Cave of
Mammon by himself.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:36.173
He's been separated from his
guide, his teacher,

00:21:36.173 --> 00:21:41.758
the palmer.Milton seems
actually to have forgotten

00:21:41.758 --> 00:21:45.254
something is.
His memory has failed him and,

00:21:45.254 --> 00:21:48.664
given the general importance
that I'm attributing to problems

00:21:48.664 --> 00:21:51.951
of remembering and forgetting,
I think it's safe to assume

00:21:51.951 --> 00:21:54.200
that something important is
going on here.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.413
The temptations that Mammon
offers Guyon are literally

00:21:58.413 --> 00:22:02.230
within the story itself
temptations of wealth,

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.293
but they're also temptations to
the wealth of classical

00:22:05.293 --> 00:22:08.470
learning, the wealth of the
entire classical heritage.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.262
You'll remember that Mammon has
a special place within his cave

00:22:12.262 --> 00:22:14.769
that's called the garden of
Proserpine,

00:22:14.769 --> 00:22:20.119
and the Garden of Proserpine
has within it all of the central

00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:25.380
symbols of pagan wisdom and of
beautiful epic literature.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.957
Perhaps you'll remember,
too, that Tantalus is present

00:22:29.957 --> 00:22:34.051
in the cave of Mammon,
literary temptation being as

00:22:34.051 --> 00:22:37.661
important as all other
temptations in this canto of

00:22:37.661 --> 00:22:40.424
Spenser's.
The temptations of classical

00:22:40.424 --> 00:22:44.269
literature are so genuinely
tempting to Milton that he finds

00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:48.179
it impossible to imagine that
Guyon could have seen and known

00:22:48.179 --> 00:22:52.349
and yet abstained from them
without the aid of his teacher,

00:22:52.349 --> 00:22:55.656
the palmer.You'll note in
this passage from

00:22:55.656 --> 00:23:00.400
Areopagitica that Milton
himself calls Spenser a teacher.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.586
He's a better teacher than
Scotus or Aquinas,

00:23:03.586 --> 00:23:07.643
and the text seems almost to
suggest that Milton can't do

00:23:07.643 --> 00:23:10.829
without his own teacher,
Edmund Spenser.

00:23:10.829 --> 00:23:14.581
Milton needs Spenser -- this is
an argument that's been

00:23:14.581 --> 00:23:18.749
amplified at some length and
really quite brilliantly by John

00:23:18.749 --> 00:23:22.848
Guillory in the book Poetic
Authority -- Milton needs

00:23:22.848 --> 00:23:26.321
Spenser to serve as the
Christian poet who can help

00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:30.559
Milton fight off the temptations
of pagan poets like Homer and

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:34.710
Virgil;
or perhaps Spenser is a poet

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:40.440
who can help Milton fight off
the temptations of even a

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:45.640
secular contemporary like
William Shakespeare.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:51.416
It's almost as if the story of
Mammon's temptations of Guyon

00:23:51.416 --> 00:23:55.544
has hit a raw nerve in Milton.
Milton's lifelong

00:23:55.544 --> 00:23:58.996
susceptibility to this story,
and that will without question

00:23:58.996 --> 00:24:02.267
prove to be the case,
speaks to a truly profound

00:24:02.267 --> 00:24:06.649
ambivalence about the pleasure
to be derived from a reading of

00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:09.878
secular literature.
Milton seems genuinely

00:24:09.878 --> 00:24:14.673
ambivalent about all of the time
and all of the study that he has

00:24:14.673 --> 00:24:18.869
invested in his own education to
become an epic poet.

00:24:18.869 --> 00:24:23.415
I think that the metaphors of
investment here and of profit

00:24:23.415 --> 00:24:28.117
are especially applicable since
it's the figure of Mammon who

00:24:28.117 --> 00:24:32.976
provides Milton with a literary
version of his economic account

00:24:32.976 --> 00:24:37.599
of poetic investment and poetic
profit.Let's look at the

00:24:37.599 --> 00:24:41.910
first appearance of Mammon in
Paradise Lost.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:47.561
This is page 228 of the
Hughes, Book One,

00:24:47.561 --> 00:24:50.708
line 678.
Milton's describing the

00:24:50.708 --> 00:24:53.391
landscape of hell,
and hell here,

00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:56.660
it turns out,
seems to resemble Milton's

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.859
heaven in that it contains deep
within it -- and we would never

00:25:01.859 --> 00:25:06.386
have expected this -- it
contains deep within it a soil

00:25:06.386 --> 00:25:11.233
that is hiding precious metals.
This is an underworld,

00:25:11.233 --> 00:25:15.170
of course, but there seems to
be another underworld resting

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.410
just beneath it.
It's an underworld filled with

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.180
gold that a brigade of fallen
angels begins to extract with

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.765
spades and pick axes.
So this is what Milton tells us

00:25:25.765 --> 00:25:29.153
at line 678:
Mammon led them on [this

00:25:29.153 --> 00:25:33.771
angelic brigade]Mammon,
the least erected Spirit that

00:25:33.771 --> 00:25:36.740
fellFrom
heav'n…

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.354
And even in heaven,
we're told Mammon was always

00:25:39.354 --> 00:25:42.247
looking down [laughs]
-- it's kind of a cute scene --

00:25:42.247 --> 00:25:45.418
Mammon was always looking down
at heaven's golden pavement

00:25:45.418 --> 00:25:48.589
rather than contemplating the
more elevated figure,

00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:50.299
presumably, of the heavenly
father.

00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:55.490
And in line 684 we are told
this of Mammon:

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.087
…
[B]y him firstMen also,

00:25:58.087 --> 00:26:01.444
and by his suggestion
taught,Ransack'd the Center,

00:26:01.444 --> 00:26:04.295
and with impious
handsRifl'd the bowels of

00:26:04.295 --> 00:26:07.589
thir mother EarthFor
Treasures better hid.

00:26:07.589 --> 00:26:13.399
Soon had his crewOp'nd into
the Hill a spacious woundAnd

00:26:13.399 --> 00:26:18.001
digg'd out ribs of Gold.
When we consider the degree of

00:26:18.001 --> 00:26:21.029
Milton's anxieties about his own
attachment to classical

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:23.147
learning,
I think we can see the

00:26:23.147 --> 00:26:25.730
significance of Mammon's actions
here.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:29.062
The image of men,
and it's a grotesque image,

00:26:29.062 --> 00:26:33.606
of men rifling the bowels of
their mother earth for treasures

00:26:33.606 --> 00:26:37.696
better hid -- this is a
disgusting and terrifying image

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:40.708
of a lot of things.
One of the things,

00:26:40.708 --> 00:26:44.250
I think, that it's an image of
is the practice of literary

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.022
excavation.
To ransack the intellectual

00:26:47.022 --> 00:26:51.251
treasures hidden away in the
landscape of literary history is

00:26:51.251 --> 00:26:54.351
an act, on some level,
of a kind of a violent

00:26:54.351 --> 00:26:56.530
desecration.
Milton, I think,

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:00.024
would need to defend himself
from the implications of this

00:27:00.024 --> 00:27:03.518
act of violence.And so
Milton calls on none other than

00:27:03.518 --> 00:27:06.210
his teacher,
Spenser.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:10.307
Milton seems to have dug around
rather carefully in his copy of

00:27:10.307 --> 00:27:14.140
the Faerie Queene,
and he's come up with this

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.185
illusion.
You actually see this near the

00:27:17.185 --> 00:27:20.901
top of your handout,
the allusion from the Faerie

00:27:20.901 --> 00:27:23.000
Queene.
It's the passage from

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.070
Spenser's cave of Mammon
canto that describes this

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:29.250
same scene of violation,
the violation of mother earth.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:33.886
The first discovery of gold for
Spenser took place when "a

00:27:33.886 --> 00:27:39.091
cursed hand, the quiet womb / of
his great-grandmother with steel

00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:43.003
to wound…"
Spenser, just like Milton after

00:27:43.003 --> 00:27:47.551
him, seems to be associating the
digging of gold with the pursuit

00:27:47.551 --> 00:27:51.706
of a very literary past.
They're on the same wave length

00:27:51.706 --> 00:27:55.747
here.Now it's not entirely
clear that Milton has been

00:27:55.747 --> 00:27:59.715
successful in sufficiently
vilifying Mammon's project of

00:27:59.715 --> 00:28:04.168
the excavation of riches.
I think in a lot of ways -- and

00:28:04.168 --> 00:28:08.450
this could probably be said of
Spenser as well -- Milton is

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:11.329
attracted to the excavation
project.

00:28:11.329 --> 00:28:18.400
Look again at the sentence that
I just read, the last lines:

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.252
Soon had his
crewOp'nd into the Hill a

00:28:22.252 --> 00:28:26.759
spacious woundAnd dig'd out
ribs of Gold." 

00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:30.438
The fallen angels may be --
okay, they may be violating

00:28:30.438 --> 00:28:32.209
mother earth,
not so great,

00:28:32.209 --> 00:28:35.069
but look what this violation
produces.

00:28:35.069 --> 00:28:39.269
Out of the wound are dug "ribs
of gold."

00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:44.965
The image that seems initially
negative begins to resemble

00:28:44.965 --> 00:28:49.361
something, I think,
quite important and quite

00:28:49.361 --> 00:28:52.363
beautiful.
I'm thinking here of the

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:55.199
creation of Eve.
Adam will tell us later -- this

00:28:55.199 --> 00:28:58.323
is in Book Eight when Adam
recounts for us the creation of

00:28:58.323 --> 00:29:00.250
Eve -- that God:
…

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:03.096
op'n'd up my left side,
and tookFrom thence a

00:29:03.096 --> 00:29:06.595
Rib…[W]ide was the
wound…[but t]he Rib

00:29:06.595 --> 00:29:09.559
He form'd and fashion'd with his
hands.

00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:13.805
And when we remember that God
will dig a rib out of Adam's

00:29:13.805 --> 00:29:16.859
wound in order to create the
beautiful,

00:29:16.859 --> 00:29:19.923
the golden Eve,
we realize how complicated,

00:29:19.923 --> 00:29:24.384
how complex and how ambivalent,
Milton's little image is here

00:29:24.384 --> 00:29:28.347
at the beginning of the poem.
Milton is loading every rift of

00:29:28.347 --> 00:29:31.487
this passage with ore,
and there seems to be something

00:29:31.487 --> 00:29:34.509
at least provisionally -- at
least for a moment,

00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:38.513
there seems to be something
potentially redemptive and

00:29:38.513 --> 00:29:42.970
potentially generative about the
activity of excavation that

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:47.050
Milton is describing otherwise
so negatively here,

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:51.729
that he's condemning here.
Mammon uses this extracted gold

00:29:51.729 --> 00:29:55.071
to create that magnificent
structure Pandemonium,

00:29:55.071 --> 00:29:58.693
and the function of this
structure is implicit in its

00:29:58.693 --> 00:30:01.330
name.
Pandemonium comes from pan

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.069
daimonium:
pan-demon.

00:30:03.069 --> 00:30:06.648
It's the place where all of the
demons, all of the fallen

00:30:06.648 --> 00:30:09.809
angels, will congregate.
This is their political capital.

00:30:09.809 --> 00:30:14.712
This is where they will debate
their future and establish a new

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:18.521
political institution.
This structure -- and this is

00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:22.344
something that's important for
Milton to convey to us -- is

00:30:22.344 --> 00:30:25.869
genuinely beautiful.
It's not entirely clear that

00:30:25.869 --> 00:30:29.815
Milton wants us to think of
Pandemonium as unambiguously

00:30:29.815 --> 00:30:32.916
evil.
Clearly, it's evil in all sorts

00:30:32.916 --> 00:30:35.502
of ways.
This is the fallen institution

00:30:35.502 --> 00:30:39.207
established by the fallen angels
-- but it's more complicated

00:30:39.207 --> 00:30:42.373
than that.
Look at Milton's description of

00:30:42.373 --> 00:30:47.217
the architect of Pandemonium.
This is the man who appears as

00:30:47.217 --> 00:30:51.480
the fallen angels enter the
building at line 732.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.769
The architect of Pandemonium is
Mulciber and:

00:30:55.769 --> 00:30:59.251
[H]is hand was
knownIn Heav'n by many a

00:30:59.251 --> 00:31:03.458
Tow'red structure high,Where
Scepter'd Angels held thir

00:31:03.458 --> 00:31:06.650
residenceAnd sat as
Princes...

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:10.378
Mulciber was famous in heaven
for building beautiful palaces

00:31:10.378 --> 00:31:14.170
there, and Milton lets us know
that there isn't actually that

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.041
much of a difference,
at least in terms of

00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:20.723
architectural or aesthetic
quality, between the palaces of

00:31:20.723 --> 00:31:24.202
heaven and the palaces of hell.
For a moment at least,

00:31:24.202 --> 00:31:27.408
it's almost as if there were a
strange moral equivalence

00:31:27.408 --> 00:31:30.789
between the palaces up there and
the palaces down here.

00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:33.917
A lot of the rigid moral
distinctions that the poem has

00:31:33.917 --> 00:31:37.334
actually been working rather
hard to establish are beginning

00:31:37.334 --> 00:31:40.078
to blur.
The line between good and evil

00:31:40.078 --> 00:31:43.293
is beginning to blur.
Look at Milton's account of

00:31:43.293 --> 00:31:45.960
what happened to Mulciber later
on earth.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:52.604
This is line 739: 
Nor was his name unheard

00:31:52.604 --> 00:31:55.509
or unador'dIn ancient
Greece;

00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:58.609
and in Ausonian landMen call'd
him Mulciber;

00:31:58.609 --> 00:32:02.117
and how he fellFrom Heav'n,
they fabl'd,

00:32:02.117 --> 00:32:06.848
thrown by angry JoveSheer
o'er the Crystal Battlements:

00:32:06.848 --> 00:32:13.313
from MornTo Noon he fell,
from Noon to dewy Eve,A

00:32:13.313 --> 00:32:16.621
Summers day;
and with the setting

00:32:16.621 --> 00:32:20.648
SunDropt from the Zenith
like a falling Star,On

00:32:20.648 --> 00:32:23.930
Lemnos th' Ægean
Isle…

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:28.608
Milton tell us that the story
of Mulciber in ancient Greece --

00:32:28.608 --> 00:32:32.979
in Homer's account of The
Iliad, he tells us

00:32:32.979 --> 00:32:35.482
this story.
It's actually the Homeric

00:32:35.482 --> 00:32:38.945
version of the story of Mulciber
that you have reproduced for you

00:32:38.945 --> 00:32:42.375
on the handout.
Milton is reminding us with

00:32:42.375 --> 00:32:47.922
this illusion of the punishment
of Mulciber and the punishment

00:32:47.922 --> 00:32:53.559
by implication of all of the
fallen angels by an angry God;

00:32:53.559 --> 00:32:56.727
but at the very moment that
he's telling us of Mulciber's

00:32:56.727 --> 00:32:59.329
punishment, he's allowing
himself to dilate,

00:32:59.329 --> 00:33:03.276
to augment or to expand,
this beautiful little nugget

00:33:03.276 --> 00:33:06.920
that's been excavated from the
pages of Homer,

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.240
and he allows himself to linger
over its beauty.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:16.999
Just look at those lines again: 
[F]rom MornTo Noon he

00:33:16.999 --> 00:33:22.920
fell, from Noon to dewy
Eve,A Summer's day.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.731
I propose that for a moment,
we almost forget what's

00:33:26.731 --> 00:33:29.869
actually being described in the
passage.

00:33:29.869 --> 00:33:34.348
It's as if the story of
Mulciber's punishment has come

00:33:34.348 --> 00:33:38.151
to a standstill.
Of course, it's with no small

00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:42.713
help from Milton's incredibly
elastic blank verse here that

00:33:42.713 --> 00:33:47.039
the headlong rush of Mulciber's
fall has been drawn to a

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:50.765
provisional stop.
It's been drawn out and

00:33:50.765 --> 00:33:53.278
spatial-ized.
It's as if it's been

00:33:53.278 --> 00:33:56.720
spatial-ized into a scene of a
beautiful summer's day,

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:00.486
and we're left contemplating
not the punishment of evil but

00:34:00.486 --> 00:34:03.270
-- I don't know,
one of the things we're left

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.960
contemplating is the sheer
beauty of Homeric poetry.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.334
Milton has dug up a gem from
the pages of The

00:34:09.334 --> 00:34:13.427
Iliad, and this gem
has something like a Medusa

00:34:13.427 --> 00:34:17.090
effect on the poem or perhaps on
us as readers.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:22.038
Time almost seems to stop when
we begin appreciating this image

00:34:22.038 --> 00:34:25.630
solely on aesthetic
grounds.But Milton,

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:30.309
of course, is a Christian poet,
and he will not allow time to

00:34:30.309 --> 00:34:34.098
stop forever;
for as soon as he explains that

00:34:34.098 --> 00:34:38.913
Mulciber fell like a star on
Lemnos, the Ægean Isle,

00:34:38.913 --> 00:34:42.031
he adds this:
[T]hus they

00:34:42.031 --> 00:34:45.030
relate,Erring;
for he with this rebellious

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.650
routFell long
before…

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:48.560
This is so mean.

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.773
Just as we were beginning to
appreciate the loveliness of the

00:34:58.773 --> 00:35:02.092
classical tradition,
Milton reminds us -- once again

00:35:02.092 --> 00:35:05.400
he reestablishes the moral poles
of good and evil:

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.080
"hus they relate,
/ erring."

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.460
Who cares?
Who cares what Homer says?

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.107
What did Homer or any of
Homer's contemporaries know

00:35:13.107 --> 00:35:15.866
about Mulciber?
Mulciber fell long before Homer

00:35:15.866 --> 00:35:19.378
because Mulciber fell long
before the creation of the earth

00:35:19.378 --> 00:35:23.043
-- and it's Milton,
and it's no other poet before

00:35:23.043 --> 00:35:27.469
Milton, who's finally able to
set the record straight.

00:35:27.469 --> 00:35:31.110
Milton's insisting here that
all of the pagan deities had

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:34.444
originally been fallen angels.
He's providing us with

00:35:34.444 --> 00:35:37.182
something of a prehistory of
classical mythology,

00:35:37.182 --> 00:35:39.920
a prehistory of classical
mythology that had,

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.490
of course, been completely
unknown to Homer and Virgil,

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:46.994
naturally, because they didn't
have the benefit of the

00:35:46.994 --> 00:35:51.094
Christian story of the fall of
the rebel angels.Now without

00:35:51.094 --> 00:35:55.260
doubt this is a dubious theory
of classical anthropology.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.165
Milton probably knows that;
but it's a theory that serves

00:35:59.165 --> 00:36:02.409
an obviously useful function for
Milton.

00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:06.023
It allows the poet to
appropriate all of the classical

00:36:06.023 --> 00:36:10.046
literature that he wants to
because in the end he'll be able

00:36:10.046 --> 00:36:13.760
to correct that literature.
He can compare the myths of

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.139
Homer -- the earliest myths we
have -- he can compare them

00:36:17.139 --> 00:36:20.518
directly to the time scheme of
Christian history and prove

00:36:20.518 --> 00:36:23.659
beyond a shadow of a doubt that
his own version,

00:36:23.659 --> 00:36:28.039
that Milton's own version,
of the story comes first.

00:36:28.039 --> 00:36:31.757
Milton may be writing after
Homer, but the story he's

00:36:31.757 --> 00:36:34.519
telling comes first.
This is one of the primary

00:36:34.519 --> 00:36:37.219
strategies that Milton develops,
especially in the first two

00:36:37.219 --> 00:36:40.856
books of Paradise Lost,
 as a kind of defense

00:36:40.856 --> 00:36:44.880
against his dependence on
classical literature.Now

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.070
Milton may not be able to forget
Homer,

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:53.130
but he is able to correct Homer
or to preempt Homer.

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:56.980
Let's look at a later
manifestation of Mammon.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:02.175
This is in Book Two, line 249.
This is page 238 of the

00:37:02.175 --> 00:37:05.440
Hughes, Book Two,
line 249.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:10.239
This is Mammon's speech during
the great consult in hell.

00:37:10.239 --> 00:37:13.595
The subject of the debate has
been the nature of the fallen

00:37:13.595 --> 00:37:15.736
angels' political future:
essentially,

00:37:15.736 --> 00:37:18.340
the question is where do we go
from here?

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.500
Moloch, you'll remember,
is the military general who

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.090
will risk absolutely anything
for revenge.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:28.274
Belial is the lovely
intellectual,

00:37:28.274 --> 00:37:32.313
the intellectual seeking peace
and who prizes above all things

00:37:32.313 --> 00:37:35.159
his intellectual freedom:
our thoughts,

00:37:35.159 --> 00:37:38.497
as Belial puts it,
our "thoughts that wander

00:37:38.497 --> 00:37:42.980
through eternity."
Mammon is the profiteer.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:50.063
Mammon is the goldsmith's son
who wants to invest his talents

00:37:50.063 --> 00:37:56.909
with labor and with hard work in
order to show a profit.

00:37:56.909 --> 00:38:00.826
Mammon's advice is thus not to
seek revenge on heaven or to

00:38:00.826 --> 00:38:03.190
give up, as Belial is
counseling,

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:08.102
in despair but to cultivate all
of the rich resources that we

00:38:08.102 --> 00:38:11.909
have down here in hell.
So line 249 of Book Two: 

00:38:11.909 --> 00:38:15.534
Let us [this is Mammon]
not then pursueBy force

00:38:15.534 --> 00:38:17.865
impossible, by leave
obtain'dUn&amp;a

00:38:17.865 --> 00:38:20.234
grave;cceptable,
though in Heav'n,

00:38:20.234 --> 00:38:23.077
our stateOf splendid
vassalage, but rather

00:38:23.077 --> 00:38:26.679
seekOur own good from
ourselves…[T]hough in

00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:29.825
this vast recess,
Free, and to none

00:38:29.825 --> 00:38:34.340
accountable, preferringHard
liberty before the easy

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:39.288
yokeOf servile Pomp.
And a few lines down Mammon

00:38:39.288 --> 00:38:44.475
tells us that we will "work ease
out of pain / through labour and

00:38:44.475 --> 00:38:47.334
endurance."
He's offering us essentially an

00:38:47.334 --> 00:38:49.837
economic model that,
I think, we as readers of

00:38:49.837 --> 00:38:53.161
Milton recognize.
This is the model of investment

00:38:53.161 --> 00:38:56.729
and profit that had
characterized Jesus' parable of

00:38:56.729 --> 00:38:59.414
the talents.
It's the model of investment

00:38:59.414 --> 00:39:02.758
and profit that characterized so
many of Milton's own early

00:39:02.758 --> 00:39:05.230
writings,
including that promise,

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:08.714
you'll remember,
to his fellow Englishmen that

00:39:08.714 --> 00:39:12.817
he would one day produce a work
of literature that his

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:17.849
countrymen would not willingly
let die.Now for my money,

00:39:17.849 --> 00:39:21.133
it's Belial who gives us the
most beautiful and the most

00:39:21.133 --> 00:39:23.940
seductive contribution to the
debate in hell,

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:28.889
but it has got to be Mammon who
most resembles Milton himself.

00:39:28.889 --> 00:39:33.886
It's Mammon that comes closest
to Milton's own -- this puritan

00:39:33.886 --> 00:39:38.472
ethos of disciplined liberty,
hard work, and this kind of

00:39:38.472 --> 00:39:43.222
absolute self-sufficiency.
In so many ways it seems that

00:39:43.222 --> 00:39:47.886
Mammon is actually echoing a lot
of the political prose that

00:39:47.886 --> 00:39:50.889
Milton had written a decade
before.

00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:53.519
It's almost as if in the
character of Mammon,

00:39:53.519 --> 00:39:55.730
we have Milton's parody of
himself.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:40:00.043
That cry, "Let us seek our own
good from ourselves" -- it's a

00:40:00.043 --> 00:40:04.212
perfect Miltonic tag for the
first two books of Paradise

00:40:04.212 --> 00:40:06.895
Lost.
Milton is always seeking a

00:40:06.895 --> 00:40:10.694
good from himself that is
morally superior to the good of

00:40:10.694 --> 00:40:14.893
his classical predecessors.
Milton refuses the state of

00:40:14.893 --> 00:40:18.739
splendid vassalage to a kingly
poet like Homer.

00:40:18.739 --> 00:40:23.349
He's continually seeking a good
from within his own religious

00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:28.266
and from within his own literary
sensibility.Now in these two

00:40:28.266 --> 00:40:32.569
books we've seen Milton dig up
and discard just about the

00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:36.179
entire [laughs]
tradition of epic poetry.

00:40:36.179 --> 00:40:41.351
It's at the end of Book two
that Milton seems to complete

00:40:41.351 --> 00:40:45.229
this process,
this process of a trashing of

00:40:45.229 --> 00:40:49.828
his literary predecessors.
It's here at the end of the

00:40:49.828 --> 00:40:53.485
second book that Milton is
finally ready to embrace the

00:40:53.485 --> 00:40:56.945
poetics of his better teacher,
Edmund Spenser,

00:40:56.945 --> 00:41:01.767
and out of nowhere -- and I
know that all first-time readers

00:41:01.767 --> 00:41:06.261
of Paradise Lost are
surprised by this -- we have

00:41:06.261 --> 00:41:10.920
Milton engaging the fine art of
Spenserian allegory.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.440
So let me remind you of what's
happening.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:16.698
Satan flies out of hell.
He journeys heroically through

00:41:16.698 --> 00:41:22.123
chaos in order to find that new
planet that he had heard about

00:41:22.123 --> 00:41:25.262
in heaven,
and he's stopped by a figure

00:41:25.262 --> 00:41:29.370
who holds the keys to hell's
gate and who can determine who

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:33.902
is able to leave and who is able
to enter.Now it goes without

00:41:33.902 --> 00:41:38.010
saying that Milton has not been
up to this point writing an

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.792
allegorical poem.
The creatures moving and

00:41:41.792 --> 00:41:45.958
speaking have been actual
creations of the deity,

00:41:45.958 --> 00:41:49.429
with the strange exception of
Medusa.

00:41:49.429 --> 00:41:53.723
They have a substantial reality
within the fictional context,

00:41:53.723 --> 00:41:56.300
the mimetic context,
of this epic.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.356
These are angels.
They are individual creatures

00:41:59.356 --> 00:42:03.073
who seem really to be in hell
just as they seem really to have

00:42:03.073 --> 00:42:05.533
been in heaven;
but the figures of Sin and

00:42:05.533 --> 00:42:07.840
Death, they are entirely
different animals.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.734
They are mere personifications
of abstract ideas,

00:42:11.734 --> 00:42:15.710
and it's not at all clear that
Sin and her son,

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:18.904
Death, exist as individual
entities in the same way,

00:42:18.904 --> 00:42:21.410
or on the same plane,
that Satan does,

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:24.837
for example, or Beelzebub.
It's reasonable,

00:42:24.837 --> 00:42:27.304
I think, to invoke Dr.
Johnson here,

00:42:27.304 --> 00:42:30.334
Samuel Johnson,
who writes in his Life of

00:42:30.334 --> 00:42:34.351
Milton that Milton's (I love
this) unskillful allegory

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:38.579
appears to be one of the
greatest faults of the poem.

00:42:38.579 --> 00:42:42.164
Whenever Johnson is being
arrogant and mean about

00:42:42.164 --> 00:42:45.824
Paradise Lost,
invariably he's on to

00:42:45.824 --> 00:42:48.202
something,
and here he's telling us that

00:42:48.202 --> 00:42:51.059
Milton's gone too far.
He's taken his allegory too far.

00:42:51.059 --> 00:42:55.508
He permits a real character
like Satan to interact with a

00:42:55.508 --> 00:42:59.639
merely allegorical or symbolic
character like Sin.

00:42:59.639 --> 00:43:03.261
The effect for Johnson -- and
who can say that this is -- that

00:43:03.261 --> 00:43:06.064
Johnson is wrong?
-- involves an awkward

00:43:06.064 --> 00:43:10.478
collision of different artistic
modes and entirely distinct

00:43:10.478 --> 00:43:13.369
planes of reality.I don't
know.

00:43:13.369 --> 00:43:15.746
If you've ever seen a movie --
well, there are lots of movies

00:43:15.746 --> 00:43:17.744
that do this;
one of the first movies that

00:43:17.744 --> 00:43:19.750
did this was "Who Killed Roger
Rabbit?"

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:23.338
-- if that's something you're
familiar with -- in which the

00:43:23.338 --> 00:43:27.175
interaction of real people with
what are called "Toons" in that

00:43:27.175 --> 00:43:29.650
film is part of the film's
pleasure.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:35.150
The boundary between different
levels of reality is crossed.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:39.637
Milton's performing a similar
boundary-crossing aesthetic

00:43:39.637 --> 00:43:43.352
gesture here.
Now it might be morally useful

00:43:43.352 --> 00:43:48.629
to talk about the forces of Sin
and Death as if they were actual

00:43:48.629 --> 00:43:51.723
moral agents,
but it makes no sense within

00:43:51.723 --> 00:43:55.231
the mimetic narrative that
Milton has created for us here

00:43:55.231 --> 00:43:59.211
in this realistic poem.
I think that Milton is acutely

00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:03.914
self-conscious of the uncertain
status that these allegorical

00:44:03.914 --> 00:44:07.050
characters that he has invented
have.

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.829
And so I'm going to propose
this: the idea that Milton's own

00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:14.866
allegory, while it is a serious
allegory and it's performing all

00:44:14.866 --> 00:44:18.389
sorts of work that I don't have
time to talk about,

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:24.177
is at the same time a critique
of allegory.Look at the

00:44:24.177 --> 00:44:29.550
description of Sin.
This is line 648 on page 247 of

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:32.800
the Hughes:
Before the Gates there

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.242
satOn either side a
formidable shape;The one

00:44:36.242 --> 00:44:40.633
seem'd Woman to the waist,
and fair,But ended foul in

00:44:40.633 --> 00:44:44.689
many a scaly foldVoluminous
and vast, a Serpent

00:44:44.689 --> 00:44:47.610
arm'dWith mortal
sting.

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.439
Now those of you who have taken
English 125 or any course that

00:44:50.439 --> 00:44:53.223
has asked you to read Spenser
will recognize almost instantly

00:44:53.223 --> 00:44:56.510
I think,
I hope, Milton's literary depth.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:45:00.392
At the very moment that Milton
is beginning his own attempt at

00:45:00.392 --> 00:45:04.402
allegory, he alludes to the most
famous allegorical character by

00:45:04.402 --> 00:45:07.139
England's most famous
allegorical poet.

00:45:07.139 --> 00:45:10.857
This is Errour,
the filthy dragoness who charms

00:45:10.857 --> 00:45:15.302
us, or doesn't charm us,
in the first canto of the first

00:45:15.302 --> 00:45:19.598
book of the Faerie Queene.
Like Milton's Sin,

00:45:19.598 --> 00:45:22.855
Spenser's Errour is half woman,
half serpent,

00:45:22.855 --> 00:45:26.705
and in a lot of ways she
embodies the very problem of

00:45:26.705 --> 00:45:28.523
religious error.
Dr.

00:45:28.523 --> 00:45:33.610
Johnson is right to suggest
that Milton's use of Spenserian

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:37.470
allegory only invites a
confusion of what are

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:42.469
essentially disparate and
irreconcilable categories;

00:45:42.469 --> 00:45:45.589
but what Johnson doesn't seem
to understand is that the

00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:47.900
confusion is precisely Milton's
point.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:52.958
It doesn't make sense to speak
of sin and death as if they were

00:45:52.958 --> 00:45:57.610
living entities capable of
action and actual influence,

00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:03.903
as if they were living entities
moving about as agents in the

00:46:03.903 --> 00:46:08.754
world.And why is that?
Within the perspective of

00:46:08.754 --> 00:46:13.197
Milton's free-will theology,
sin can't exist as an external

00:46:13.197 --> 00:46:16.337
reality.
It can't exist as a force that

00:46:16.337 --> 00:46:20.701
conceives a human individual
from the outside without that

00:46:20.701 --> 00:46:24.530
individual's consent because we
all freely sin.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.830
No one can be compelled to do
anything within the Miltonic

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:30.719
theology of free will.
Sin can only exist as the

00:46:30.719 --> 00:46:34.199
product of individual choices
that freely willing people,

00:46:34.199 --> 00:46:38.522
like Adam and Eve or like Satan
before his fall,

00:46:38.522 --> 00:46:43.121
make and for Milton to parse
the world into rigidly

00:46:43.121 --> 00:46:47.260
determined categories like good
and evil,

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.350
or sin and virtue,
is simply to be guilty of

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:54.204
intellectual error.
This isn't how the world works

00:46:54.204 --> 00:46:57.329
in -- this isn't the Miltonic
universe.

00:46:57.329 --> 00:47:00.185
Milton is alluding so
unashamedly here to Spenser's

00:47:00.185 --> 00:47:01.670
Errour because,
I think,

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:06.269
on some level he wants to brand
Spenserian allegory as an

00:47:06.269 --> 00:47:09.964
erroneous literary
practice.Now we've seen

00:47:09.964 --> 00:47:14.752
Milton do this before.
He uses -- and I'm thinking of

00:47:14.752 --> 00:47:20.233
"uses" in a pejorative way -- a
poet like Homer to extract what

00:47:20.233 --> 00:47:24.829
beauty he can from deep within
the Homeric minds,

00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:28.673
and then he does that only to
turn on Homer with that

00:47:28.673 --> 00:47:31.555
devastating dismissal:
"hus they relate,

00:47:31.555 --> 00:47:34.158
/ erring."
He doesn't even give Homer the

00:47:34.158 --> 00:47:36.353
credit of [laughs]
being singular in having

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:39.030
composed The Iliad.
"They" -- who's "they"?

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:42.554
He can't even bring himself to
say, "Thus he relates,

00:47:42.554 --> 00:47:45.719
erring," so powerful is this
defense against Homer.

00:47:45.719 --> 00:47:48.243
Homer was in error,
Milton told us,

00:47:48.243 --> 00:47:52.548
and Milton called on the moral
voice of Spenser to help him

00:47:52.548 --> 00:47:55.739
make that moral judgment against
Homer.

00:47:55.739 --> 00:48:00.086
But one of Milton's projects in
Paradise Lost is to

00:48:00.086 --> 00:48:04.510
effect his forgetting of all of
his literary precursors.

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:08.478
That means that he has to expel
from his system not just Homer,

00:48:08.478 --> 00:48:11.934
not just Virgil and Dante,
but also his better teacher,

00:48:11.934 --> 00:48:15.269
Edmund Spenser.
It's almost as if we can hear

00:48:15.269 --> 00:48:19.508
Milton say, after he's given his
own really quite elaborate

00:48:19.508 --> 00:48:24.773
display of allegorical poetry,
"Thus Spenser relates,

00:48:24.773 --> 00:48:30.579
erring."Now in 1644 when he
wrote the Areopagitica,

00:48:30.579 --> 00:48:34.416
Milton may have forgotten
that Spenser's Guyon did in fact

00:48:34.416 --> 00:48:37.750
descend in to hell without the
help of his teacher,

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.601
the palmer.
For Milton then,

00:48:40.601 --> 00:48:44.882
at least at that point in his
career, his literary career,

00:48:44.882 --> 00:48:49.690
such a trip without a guide may
well have seemed unthinkable.

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:53.673
The temptations of the wealth
of classical literature

00:48:53.673 --> 00:48:57.963
represented by Mammon perhaps
were too powerful to resist

00:48:57.963 --> 00:49:01.141
alone;
but now in the 1660s I think

00:49:01.141 --> 00:49:06.137
it's possible to see a way in
which Milton finally gets the

00:49:06.137 --> 00:49:08.943
story right.
He realizes now that it is

00:49:08.943 --> 00:49:12.146
possible, perhaps it is
possible, for the Christian poet

00:49:12.146 --> 00:49:15.000
to descend into the literary
underworld alone,

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.949
just as it was possible for Sir
Guyon in the actual Faerie

00:49:18.949 --> 00:49:22.570
Queene to descend in to the
cave of Mammon alone.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:27.086
Milton surveys the wealth of
literary tradition before him,

00:49:27.086 --> 00:49:31.291
and he resists its allure
without the help of any human

00:49:31.291 --> 00:49:33.362
guide.
He can reject the beauty of

00:49:33.362 --> 00:49:36.091
Homer, he can reject the beauty
of Virgil, but he can also

00:49:36.091 --> 00:49:39.059
reject -- and this has got to be
an even greater challenge,

00:49:39.059 --> 00:49:42.794
perhaps -- he can also reject
the help of his Christian

00:49:42.794 --> 00:49:47.012
teacher, Edmund Spenser.And
so I'm going to leave you here

00:49:47.012 --> 00:49:51.161
at the end of this lecture less
with a conclusion than with a

00:49:51.161 --> 00:49:53.845
paradox.
I think that Milton in

00:49:53.845 --> 00:49:58.523
Paradise Lost finally
remembers what actually happened

00:49:58.523 --> 00:50:03.674
in Spenser's cave of Mammon,
how the hero triumphed alone,

00:50:03.674 --> 00:50:09.049
but Milton remembers this
particular Spenserian story only

00:50:09.049 --> 00:50:14.141
once he has successfully
forgotten Spenser -- only once

00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:18.291
he has set aside fully his
teacher's style of

00:50:18.291 --> 00:50:23.000
poetry.Okay.
That's it for today.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.036
Next time reread for the third
time -- you will be repaid by

00:50:27.036 --> 00:50:31.278
your dedication -- Books One and
Two, this time focusing on the

00:50:31.278 --> 00:50:33.409
similes.
Also, as I mentioned at the

00:50:33.409 --> 00:50:35.835
beginning of class,
read the essays by Stanley Fish

00:50:35.835 --> 00:50:37.301
and Geoffrey Hartman.

RONALD SMITH: Well we're going
to spend the day today talking

00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:03.500
about clouds.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.900
We started this last time.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.033
So I'll do a little
bit of review.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.267
It's all PowerPoint today, which
can be fairly boring, so

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:22.033
I hope you'll shout out
questions as we go through

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:22.667
this material.

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:25.500
So just remember, the subject
today-- and we started last

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.167
time-- is clouds and other
occurrences of condensed water

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:30.067
in the atmosphere.

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:34.667
So it's all about water in
the atmosphere today.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.333
Talked about it being a water
planet, but not only in the

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:42.000
oceans but in the atmosphere,
as well.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.700
Both water vapor, which is
invisible, and the clouds that

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.433
form when water vapor
condenses.

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:50.433
We went through these
definitions.

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:53.733
I won't repeat that unless
there are questions.

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:59.300
Are there any questions
on these definitions?

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.100
You've had a couple days
to look at those.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.833
Question, yes?

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:03.567
STUDENT: I have a quick
question, whether this lecture

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:06.100
is uploaded on the
Classes server?

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.967
PROFESSOR: It's already there.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.233
I loaded it this morning,
about an hour ago.

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:12.600
It's already there.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.500
A PDF version of it.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.667
Any questions on these
definitions?

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:18.567
These are really important.

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:24.200
You can't get away without
knowing these six quantities,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.567
and these as well.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:29.633
But I'll be saying more
about this as we

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:31.467
go through the lecture.

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:34.200
But these are really
important terms.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.700
I didn't show this last, time
but I should have. It's a plot

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.667
of saturation vapor pressure
for water.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:44.067
It just says vapor pressure, but
it should say saturation

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:48.133
vapor pressure as a function
of temperature.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:51.467
Saturation vapor pressure
is defined as the--

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:54.267
well, there's two equivalent
definitions.

00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:56.233
I like them both.

00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:02.833
It's the partial pressure of
water vapor in equilibrium

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:06.367
with a condensed phase.

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:08.933
In other words, if you have a
chamber that has some liquid

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:13.233
water in it, and at a certain
temperature, and you wait for

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:18.233
a while, there'll be enough
evaporation off the surface

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:21.767
and the void will get filled
with water vapor.

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:24.967
And if you wait long enough, the
partial pressure of water

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:29.200
vapor in that chamber will come
to the value given by

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.800
this curve, depending on the
temperature of the system.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.567
So the higher the temperature,
the more water vapor will

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:41.367
evaporate, and the higher the
water vapor partial pressure

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:43.467
you will have in the chamber.

00:02:43.467 --> 00:02:44.733
Now here's a curious thing.

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:47.767
It actually doesn't matter
whether there's air in the

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:51.833
chamber above that liquid water
or not, because this is

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:55.733
a property of the water,
not of the air.

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:59.367
And I'll often mistakenly say
things like, "the air is

00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:03.800
saturated." That's not quite
right, because it's the water

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.767
vapor we're talking about.

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:10.500
Now it's interesting that that
water is mixed in to air, but

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.200
the air is not really
controlling this.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.200
This is the property
of water alone.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.200
You'd have the same partial
pressure of water vapor above

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.567
a liquid at a certain
temperature whether there was

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:23.433
air there or not.

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:25.900
Of course, if there was air
there, the total pressure

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.433
would be higher, but the partial
pressure would be--

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:34.000
of water vapor would be
the same value here.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.367
Yes?

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:35.467
STUDENT: What is the difference
between saturation

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:36.733
vapor pressure and
vapor pressure?

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:45.100
PROFESSOR: The vapor pressure
is what you have. Depends on

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.467
how much water vapor you have
and its temperature.

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:52.867
But the saturation is the value
of that quantity that

00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:57.633
you would have when there's a
condensed phase present, and

00:03:57.633 --> 00:03:59.800
they've reached equilibrium.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.200
Or another way to put it is
that the saturation vapor

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.100
pressure is the maximum
you can have before

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.500
condensation begins.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.367
In other words, at a certain
temperature, let's say 20

00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:24.567
degrees Celsius, if I had a
vapor pressure of 1 millibar,

00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:30.267
that is less than the saturation
curve, so nothing's

00:04:30.267 --> 00:04:32.633
going to condense.

00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:34.333
However, I could bring the
air to saturation--

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:34.400
I just said it again--

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.867
I could bring the water vapor to
saturation either by adding

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:47.867
water vapor to that chamber in
some way or by cooling it.

00:04:47.867 --> 00:04:50.733
In any case I can approach
the saturation curve.

00:04:50.733 --> 00:04:53.133
And when I get there, whether
it's there or there, doesn't

00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:59.300
matter, the relative humidity
will be 100%.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.767
And if I try to go beyond, using
either mechanism, the

00:05:03.767 --> 00:05:07.167
excess water vapor will
condense out to

00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:09.633
form liquid or ice.

00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:13.200
So relative humidity is
less than 100% here.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.400
When you push it to saturation,
no matter how you

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.500
do it, either by adding water
or by cooling and go beyond,

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.000
then you'll get condensed
water.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.600
So that's the key idea there.

00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:31.033
And I mentioned this last
time, so there.

00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:34.267
To approach saturation,
you can add moisture.

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:36.900
That moves you up
on that diagram.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.600
Or you can drop the
temperature.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.000
And there's two common ways that
the temperature could be

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.400
dropped in an atmospheric
system.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.467
One would be cool it
by removing heat.

00:05:47.467 --> 00:05:53.233
Put that little piece of air
next to something cold, and so

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:57.800
the heat is drawn out
of it by conduction.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.933
And that leads to something
we call radiation fog.

00:05:59.933 --> 00:06:02.833
I'll give you examples,
advection fog, also.

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:07.867
Or you could cool that parcel of
air by adiabatic expansion.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.200
That means lifting it.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.467
You don't have to put in contact
with the cold surface.

00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:17.967
Just lift it, and it'll expand
as it goes to lower pressure,

00:06:17.967 --> 00:06:20.867
and cool itself by the fact
it is doing work on the

00:06:20.867 --> 00:06:22.100
environment.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.167
That'll drop the temperature.

00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:26.033
And again, you'll push
toward saturation.

00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:29.667
And if you go beyond,
a cloud will form.

00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:33.100
So these are the three ways that
you approach saturation.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.633
I'm going to give you lots of
examples of these today.

00:06:36.633 --> 00:06:38.033
Stop me if you have questions.

00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:39.667
We did this first
few last time.

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:43.233
Sea smoke is where you
have a warm water

00:06:43.233 --> 00:06:46.000
surface and cold air.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.467
You evaporate water off the warm
surface into the air, but

00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:53.967
the air can't hold that much
water vapor, so you start to

00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:57.700
get little liquid droplets
forming from the

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.233
excess water vapor.

00:06:59.233 --> 00:07:03.200
The amount that you've pushed
beyond the saturation value.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.067
And this one we talked about
last time: contrails.

00:07:08.067 --> 00:07:12.600
You're burning hydrocarbon
fuels, byproduct of the

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.167
burning is carbon dioxide
and water vapor.

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:17.700
So you've added water
vapor to the air.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.533
You've pushed it beyond
saturation.

00:07:19.533 --> 00:07:24.200
The excess will condense out
in tiny water droplets.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.500
Remember, the vapor itself
is invisible.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.933
There's vapor everywhere here.

00:07:28.933 --> 00:07:30.733
You only see the condensed
particles,

00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:33.067
either liquid or ice.

00:07:33.067 --> 00:07:33.900
Contrails.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.100
Contrails.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.900
We talked about this.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.767
I think we did.

00:07:38.767 --> 00:07:42.700
Nuclear plants have cooling
towers to get rid of heat

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.367
that's come out of the back
side of the turbines.

00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:47.967
And what they do is
just to evaporate

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.633
large amounts of water.

00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:50.700
Put it up in the atmosphere.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.800
But as soon as that very humid
air reaches the colder

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.100
environmental atmosphere, it
condenses because you've added

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.767
water vapor.

00:08:01.767 --> 00:08:03.533
It can't be held,
and the excess

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:05.667
goes into liquid droplets.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.233
When you breathe out on a cold
winter day, you're doing

00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:12.800
exactly the same thing.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.800
Radiation fog is an example of
how we're going to cool the

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.267
air off ultimately
causing fog.

00:08:23.267 --> 00:08:27.567
And the way you do that is
usually to have a clear night,

00:08:27.567 --> 00:08:31.233
no clouds above, so the infrared
radiation from the

00:08:31.233 --> 00:08:35.300
earth's surface can escape
very handily.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.900
Maybe a good half of it escapes
to space, which cools

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:44.667
the surface of the earth down
several degrees overnight.

00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:48.367
The air right in contact with
that earth's surface then is

00:08:48.367 --> 00:08:49.500
going to lose heat by

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:55.367
conduction to the cold surface.

00:08:55.367 --> 00:09:00.433
When you lose heat, you drop the
saturation vapor pressure.

00:09:00.433 --> 00:09:02.500
You're not necessarily changing
the amount of water

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.033
vapor in the air, but you're
changing the amount that can

00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:09.500
be held in the vapor state.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.200
And therefore the fog forms
first for the air that's right

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.400
in contact with that
cooling surface.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.100
That's called radiation fog.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.367
The word radiation goes back to
how the heat has been lost

00:09:24.367 --> 00:09:26.400
from the system.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.433
But thermodynamically, it's
similar to cases we've already

00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:30.767
spoken about.

00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:36.967
This is a common thing to see,
especially in valleys, because

00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:40.933
in slightly mountainous terrain
the air that's been

00:09:40.933 --> 00:09:43.800
cooled by contact with the
surface will tend to run

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.600
downhill and collect
in the valleys.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.867
So you can get radiation
fog in flat terrain.

00:09:49.867 --> 00:09:53.300
I've seen it many times, but
I've seen it even more

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.200
frequently in slightly hilly
country where the cold air

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.800
runs down into the valley and
the fog is found most dense,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.667
most thick, down
in that valley.

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:05.833
But it's still radiation fog.

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:09.867
Notice the clear sky above,
which is usually when you get

00:10:09.867 --> 00:10:12.900
a good strong case of radiation
fog, it's because

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.867
there's no clouds
above overnight.

00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:18.000
Advection fog is a
little different.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.100
There a surface was cold to
begin with and then you

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:29.067
brought in moist air by the
winds over that surface.

00:10:29.067 --> 00:10:33.033
Once you've moved the warm air
over the surface, it loses

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.500
heat by conduction again.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.200
And the saturation vapor
pressure drops.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.700
The relative humidity exceeds
100%, and the fog forms. So

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.467
the only difference here is how
you generated the cooling.

00:10:48.467 --> 00:10:51.333
Instead of doing it by
radiation, you did it by

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:54.867
moving warm moist air over
a colder surface.

00:10:57.833 --> 00:11:01.400
This is quite common in areas
of the world ocean where you

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.600
have a cold ocean current.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.267
For example, the California
current that comes down along

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:10.600
the coast of California
is a cold current.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.367
And when warm air masses move
over that, whether it's from

00:11:14.367 --> 00:11:18.567
further west in the Pacific or
whether it comes off the land,

00:11:18.567 --> 00:11:21.033
suddenly that air's going
to lose heat to

00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:23.867
the cold water beneath.

00:11:23.867 --> 00:11:25.433
Remember, this is
not sea smoke.

00:11:25.433 --> 00:11:26.867
Sea smoke was the opposite.

00:11:26.867 --> 00:11:30.500
This is cold water, warm air.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.933
Remember, sea smoke was just
the opposite of that.

00:11:33.933 --> 00:11:37.233
Here you're not gaining
water from the ocean.

00:11:37.233 --> 00:11:42.700
You're losing heat to the ocean,
and causing the fog to

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.533
form in that way.

00:11:45.533 --> 00:11:47.500
Here's another example
of advection

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.200
fog along the coastline.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.567
It's quite common, for example,
north of here, up in

00:11:51.567 --> 00:11:55.167
the Gulf of Maine and further
up around Nova Scotia where

00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:57.267
the Labrador Current
comes down, the

00:11:57.267 --> 00:11:59.600
cold Labrador Current.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.600
It's very common.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:07.300
In fact, you might have
advection fog 2/3 of the time.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.667
You might have advection fog
over that cold flowing

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:12.967
Labrador Current, because
of this effect.

00:12:12.967 --> 00:12:15.567
No matter what direction the
wind blows in from, it's

00:12:15.567 --> 00:12:19.300
probably warmer than that
Labrador Current, so it's

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.767
going to lose heat to it, and
the fog is going to form.

00:12:22.767 --> 00:12:26.000
So it's a very foggy area up
there where there's a cold

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.200
ocean current.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.467
Questions here?

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.867
Maybe you've seen this.

00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:37.133
Now we're going to talk about
clouds, which is the primary

00:12:37.133 --> 00:12:40.367
subject of the lecture.

00:12:40.367 --> 00:12:48.567
Clouds are formed by rising
air and the thermodynamic

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:53.767
mechanism is adiabatic
cooling as air rises.

00:12:53.767 --> 00:12:57.067
As the air gets cooler, as its
temperature drops, the

00:12:57.067 --> 00:12:59.867
saturation vapor
pressure drops.

00:12:59.867 --> 00:13:05.700
And you will reach a humidity
of 100% and

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.833
then perhaps beyond.

00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:10.233
If you try to go beyond, the
excess water vapor will

00:13:10.233 --> 00:13:14.667
immediately condense out
to form a cloud.

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:17.033
So we're going to take a look
at a few types of clouds.

00:13:17.033 --> 00:13:20.067
But in all cases, the
thermodynamics is the same.

00:13:20.067 --> 00:13:23.600
So here is our friend, the fair
weather cumulus cloud

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:30.667
with the flat base, the
cauliflower turbulent tops,

00:13:30.667 --> 00:13:34.333
and probably the most common
type of cloud.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.700
I have a little time lapse movie
of-- we did a project in

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.167
my group a few months ago down
in the Caribbean, looking at

00:13:45.167 --> 00:13:49.367
how clouds and precipitation are
generated in the tropical

00:13:49.367 --> 00:13:52.133
belt of our planet.

00:13:52.133 --> 00:13:56.067
We flew aircraft through
clouds and so on.

00:13:56.067 --> 00:13:57.867
If I can get this to work, I'm
going to show you some

00:13:57.867 --> 00:14:02.000
time-lapse photography of
cumulus clouds over the island

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.467
of Dominica.

00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:04.667
The sun just rose.

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:09.100
That black to illuminated thing
was the sun rising in

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:14.367
the east. You're beginning to
see cumulus clouds forming

00:14:14.367 --> 00:14:17.933
here, bubbling up, almost like
boiling in some sense.

00:14:17.933 --> 00:14:24.033
This is heat from the land
rising, but then as the air

00:14:24.033 --> 00:14:26.500
rises, it cools.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.533
The humidity exceeds 100%, and
the cloud forms. But then the

00:14:31.533 --> 00:14:34.900
air rises into the clouds and
spreads out and descends.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:39.533
So maybe you can see it, but
clouds are also disappearing.

00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:43.000
As fast as they're being
produced in the updrafts,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.933
they're being eliminated
by the down drafts.

00:14:45.933 --> 00:14:48.867
Because this adiabatic cooling
and heating is

00:14:48.867 --> 00:14:50.567
a reversible process.

00:14:50.567 --> 00:14:51.700
You cool when you lift.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.567
You warm when you descend.

00:14:53.567 --> 00:14:57.000
And so you're going to form
cumulus clouds and the parcels

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.533
are just moving through
these things.

00:14:59.533 --> 00:15:04.400
Cloudy on the way up, and clear
air on the way down.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.500
The time is in the upper box in
local time, so now it's the

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.567
evening, just before the sunset,
when the heating of

00:15:12.567 --> 00:15:15.667
the island was reduced so
was the convection.

00:15:15.667 --> 00:15:21.900
So this was driven by the
sun heating the island.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.100
The warm air rising.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.500
But then in the rising process,
the water vapor

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.867
became saturated, condensed,
and the cloud was formed.

00:15:31.867 --> 00:15:33.633
Are there any questions
on that short--

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:34.900
on that short video?

00:15:39.767 --> 00:15:43.400
When you are looking at cumulus
clouds yourself, you

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.700
normally see a fixed pattern.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.933
You may have noticed, well it's
still here in fact, the

00:15:48.933 --> 00:15:50.567
speedup ratio on
that time-lapse

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:52.833
photography was 720.

00:15:52.833 --> 00:15:55.033
That's a big speed-up ratio.

00:15:55.033 --> 00:16:00.100
So things are happening in this
time-lapse film 700 times

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.667
faster than they do in nature.

00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:06.100
But that makes it wonderful,
because you can see the

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.667
process happening.

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:09.967
When you look at it yourself,
you see a

00:16:09.967 --> 00:16:14.000
static cloud pattern.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.500
If you try to watch
it, sometimes

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.900
you can see the changes.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.800
But it's hard, because
they're slow based on

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.967
the human time scale.

00:16:22.967 --> 00:16:26.833
You have to have a great deal
of attention focused on that

00:16:26.833 --> 00:16:30.867
cloud to be able to watch it
evolve and change over a

00:16:30.867 --> 00:16:32.600
period of an hour or two.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.667
Whereas with time lapse,
we see it all before us

00:16:34.667 --> 00:16:40.167
happening, and we can easily
understand it.

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:44.333
I wanted to give you a couple
other examples of what we did

00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:46.233
in this project.

00:16:46.233 --> 00:16:51.267
Here, for example, is a short
aircraft flight through a

00:16:51.267 --> 00:16:54.500
couple of those cumulus
clouds.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.333
The aircraft is equipped with
all kinds of wonderful

00:16:57.333 --> 00:16:58.267
instruments on board.

00:16:58.267 --> 00:16:59.567
Let me just show you what's
plotted here.

00:16:59.567 --> 00:17:03.133
So this is a horizontal distance
in kilometers so the

00:17:03.133 --> 00:17:06.267
airplane flew about 30
kilometers, and passed

00:17:06.267 --> 00:17:09.900
through, depending how you
count them, two or four

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.667
different clouds.

00:17:10.667 --> 00:17:13.967
Maybe one, two, three, four,
or something like that.

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:17.767
What's plotted in blue, LWC,
is the liquid water

00:17:17.767 --> 00:17:19.367
concentration.

00:17:19.367 --> 00:17:23.833
In those cloud drops, how much
total liquid is there in units

00:17:23.833 --> 00:17:30.500
of grams of water, liquid water,
per cubic meter of air?

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.933
We have instruments on-board
the aircraft

00:17:31.933 --> 00:17:33.300
that can measure this.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.900
And so when it's zero, of course
you're not in a cloud.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:41.800
A cloud is defined by its
liquid water content.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.400
If there's no liquid water,
you're not in a cloud.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.033
So we entered the cloud there,
we had values of one to two

00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:53.033
grams per cubic meter
of liquid.

00:17:53.033 --> 00:17:55.567
Then we're briefly out of the
cloud, back into another one.

00:17:55.567 --> 00:17:56.633
Out, in.

00:17:56.633 --> 00:17:57.667
Out, in.

00:17:57.667 --> 00:17:59.133
And finally, out.

00:17:59.133 --> 00:18:01.100
Here's the vertical motion.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.300
The air is moving up and down.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.900
So not much vertical motion
outside the cloud, but inside

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.900
the cloud it's noisy.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.167
It's turbulent.

00:18:10.167 --> 00:18:14.667
But most of the motions
are upwards.

00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:19.600
There are few little down
bursts, but generally, most of

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.867
the air inside a cloud is moving
upwards, as I argued it

00:18:23.867 --> 00:18:29.033
must be because it's adiabatic
cooling that is responsible

00:18:29.033 --> 00:18:32.067
for the cloud.

00:18:32.067 --> 00:18:34.733
Here's the water vapor
mixing ratio.

00:18:34.733 --> 00:18:37.833
We call that the specific
humidity.

00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:41.400
It was to units of grams
of water vapor

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.533
per kilogram of air--

00:18:43.533 --> 00:18:46.500
how much water is mixed
into the air.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.700
It was 11 outside the cloud, and
about 13 inside the cloud.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.233
And then we also had instruments
that could measure

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:58.767
the droplet diameter of
the cloud droplets.

00:18:58.767 --> 00:19:02.200
They're ranging between about
16 and 28 microns.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.400
A micron is a millionth
of a meter.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.333
These are small droplets,
so small.

00:19:06.333 --> 00:19:08.133
These are typical
cloud droplets.

00:19:11.667 --> 00:19:13.400
They're so small that
they don't really

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.700
fall out very much.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.200
They just follow the air.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.933
They're so tiny that their
gravitational acceleration is

00:19:19.933 --> 00:19:24.267
quite small, and they mostly
just follow the air parcels.

00:19:24.267 --> 00:19:28.333
But you can measure them as you
fly through a cloud, so

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:29.500
that gives you an
idea of that.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:34.200
And then one more diagram from
the same experiment we did.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.433
We found it under certain
conditions, some clouds would

00:19:38.433 --> 00:19:41.067
have-- the cloud droplet
diameter would be larger, in

00:19:41.067 --> 00:19:42.700
other cases, smaller.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.133
This is the probability
density of finding a

00:19:45.133 --> 00:19:48.567
particular cloud droplet
diameter.

00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:52.167
On one research flight, Research
Flight 13, we found

00:19:52.167 --> 00:19:56.367
cloud droplets that were on the
order of 20 to 25 microns.

00:19:56.367 --> 00:20:00.767
On another day, more
like 10 to 15.

00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:03.500
And that has a lot to do with
then whether it's going to

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.300
rain or not.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.767
Because in order to
produce rain--

00:20:07.767 --> 00:20:10.467
let me just remind
you of something.

00:20:10.467 --> 00:20:16.167
A raindrop is about 100 times
larger than a cloud droplet.

00:20:16.167 --> 00:20:17.800
100 times.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.233
The diameter has a ratio
of about 100 times.

00:20:21.233 --> 00:20:23.467
In order to make a raindrop, you
have to bring together a

00:20:23.467 --> 00:20:26.900
very large number of
cloud droplets.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.100
How many would you guess?

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.967
How many would you
have to bring

00:20:28.967 --> 00:20:31.067
together to form one raindrop?

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:35.600
I thought you were
going to say.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.233
Remember, I said the diameters
had a ratio of 100 to 1.

00:20:40.233 --> 00:20:43.067
But it's really volumes
we're talking about.

00:20:43.067 --> 00:20:45.500
In order to construct a
raindrop, you're going to have

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:50.033
to bring together the volume
of a raindrop.

00:20:50.033 --> 00:20:54.667
So how many droplets of 100
times smaller do you have to

00:20:54.667 --> 00:20:57.333
bring together to form the
volume of a raindrop?

00:20:57.333 --> 00:20:58.533
STUDENT: 100 cubed.

00:20:58.533 --> 00:21:00.567
PROFESSOR: 100 cubed.

00:21:00.567 --> 00:21:01.733
Right.

00:21:01.733 --> 00:21:04.833
That is to say, 10 to
the 6, or a million.

00:21:04.833 --> 00:21:07.900
You've got to bring together
a million of these

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.533
to make one a raindrop.

00:21:09.533 --> 00:21:10.400
Please remember that.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.800
Because one of the longest
questions in all of

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.100
meteorology, goes back to the
days of the Greeks, is why do

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.433
most clouds not rain?

00:21:21.433 --> 00:21:23.800
But a few do.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.633
In some cases, there's a
mechanism that can bring

00:21:26.633 --> 00:21:31.500
together a million cloud
droplets to form one raindrop.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.233
But it depends to some extent on
how the cloud droplets, how

00:21:34.233 --> 00:21:35.733
big they are to begin with.

00:21:35.733 --> 00:21:40.167
And we found some variability
from case to case in that

00:21:40.167 --> 00:21:41.833
cloud droplet size.

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:43.833
Again, the units here
are microns.

00:21:43.833 --> 00:21:44.900
These are the small ones.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.233
These are the cloud droplets.

00:21:46.233 --> 00:21:50.967
The ones that just hang
up there in the sky.

00:21:50.967 --> 00:21:52.233
Any questions here?

00:21:54.667 --> 00:21:55.133
OK.

00:21:55.133 --> 00:21:57.000
Now let's look at some
other cloud types.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.433
I'm not going to go through
this exhaustively.

00:22:01.967 --> 00:22:04.433
This is a type of cloud
that is caused--

00:22:04.433 --> 00:22:08.233
called, in the scientific
literature it's called,

00:22:08.233 --> 00:22:10.167
alto-cumulus.

00:22:10.167 --> 00:22:15.100
Alto meaning mid-level cloud,
about halfway up through the

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.300
troposphere, and cumulus because
it has some turbulent

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.500
structure to it.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:27.067
This particular type of
alto-cumulus, which has a kind

00:22:27.067 --> 00:22:30.067
of banded nature to
it, is called,

00:22:30.067 --> 00:22:33.100
colloquially, mackerel sky.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.167
And you find that term very
often in the literature of the

00:22:37.167 --> 00:22:41.800
sea, for example, but you find
it commonly in other types of

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.000
literature, as well.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.300
Now you know what's
going on here.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.233
Well, you don't know
everything.

00:22:46.233 --> 00:22:48.133
But you know that the
air is rising

00:22:48.133 --> 00:22:51.733
there, and sinking there.

00:22:51.733 --> 00:22:52.933
Rising to give you the clouds.

00:22:52.933 --> 00:22:54.433
Sinking to give you
the clear air.

00:22:54.433 --> 00:22:57.800
You don't necessarily know
what's causing that particular

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.567
pattern of rising
and sinking air.

00:23:00.567 --> 00:23:03.933
I think it has to do a little
bit with wind shear and maybe

00:23:03.933 --> 00:23:07.900
a little bit with the cooling
of the tops by radiation.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.433
But I'm not sure in this case.

00:23:09.433 --> 00:23:13.700
But I do know that that's an
alto-cumulus cloud of the type

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.700
that is commonly referred
to as mackerel sky.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.233
And where does the word
"mackerel" come

00:23:18.233 --> 00:23:21.033
from, you may be asking?

00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:27.133
Well, the fishermen that gave
that cloud its colloquial name

00:23:27.133 --> 00:23:32.500
were catching Atlantic mackerel,
and that pattern on

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:38.567
the back of the fish reminded
them of that pattern.

00:23:38.567 --> 00:23:41.833
It's not the scientific name,
but it's a common colloquial

00:23:41.833 --> 00:23:46.067
name for that kind
of cloud pattern.

00:23:46.067 --> 00:23:47.500
This is cirro-stratus.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.233
So what does that mean?

00:23:48.233 --> 00:23:52.467
Cirro means high ice cloud.

00:23:52.467 --> 00:23:56.567
Stratus means without structure,
horizontal, a

00:23:56.567 --> 00:24:01.700
fairly homogeneous horizontal
layer of cloud.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.067
You see a little bit of light
and dark patterns, but

00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:09.400
generally that is a layer of
rather continuous cloud.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.333
It's a little bit filmy,
which reminds you that

00:24:13.333 --> 00:24:14.600
it's probably ice.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.833
And if it's ice, it's
certainly high.

00:24:16.833 --> 00:24:19.833
It's certainly up in the
upper part of the--

00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:21.100
of the troposphere.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.700
Here is a fair weather cumulus
that is beginning to develop

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.300
vertically.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.433
There's enough latent heat being
given off when the water

00:24:33.433 --> 00:24:35.167
vapor is condensing.

00:24:35.167 --> 00:24:38.900
And that heat is keeping the
cloudy air warm enough.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.500
So it's not just stopping,
giving you a fair weather

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.067
cumulus, and then the air
descending again.

00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:46.933
Instead, it's continued
to rise.

00:24:46.933 --> 00:24:49.300
I don't believe it's at the
tropopause yet, so I'm going

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.200
to call that--

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.367
and it's not raining out the
bottom-- so I'm going to call

00:24:52.367 --> 00:24:54.900
that cumulus congestious.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.133
A growing cumulus cloud.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.600
But now here's one that is
raining out the bottom.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.100
You see it here.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.600
I don't see a good anvil yet.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.733
But because it's raining, and
nimbus means rain, I would

00:25:12.733 --> 00:25:15.233
definitely call that
cumulo-nimbus.

00:25:15.233 --> 00:25:17.300
It's a cumulus cloud
that's raining, and

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.833
typically these are deep.

00:25:18.833 --> 00:25:23.467
They go from one kilometer for
the base up to 8, 10, 12

00:25:23.467 --> 00:25:25.567
kilometers at the top.

00:25:25.567 --> 00:25:29.700
So that's a deep cloud
spanning the entire

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.467
troposphere, from
bottom to top.

00:25:31.467 --> 00:25:31.733
Question?

00:25:31.733 --> 00:25:34.367
STUDENT: Can you explain again
what about the latent heat

00:25:34.367 --> 00:25:36.600
causes it to keep on rising?

00:25:39.367 --> 00:25:41.967
PROFESSOR: Remember we talked
about-- we defined a stable

00:25:41.967 --> 00:25:45.700
atmosphere as an atmosphere
where a rising parcel finds

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.667
itself colder than its
environment, more dense, and

00:25:49.667 --> 00:25:51.500
wants to fall back.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.567
Well that might happen in this
environment, in the dry air,

00:25:54.567 --> 00:25:57.500
but inside the cloud
that air parcel has

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.267
another source of heat.

00:25:59.267 --> 00:26:03.867
As it rises, water vapor is
condensing, adding heat to the

00:26:03.867 --> 00:26:06.333
air parcel, making it warmer,
and that allows it

00:26:06.333 --> 00:26:09.467
to continue to rise.

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:14.667
So we would call that a moist
unstable atmosphere where, due

00:26:14.667 --> 00:26:18.100
to that extra latent heat, the
parcel is able to rise and

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:18.933
form that cloud.

00:26:18.933 --> 00:26:20.200
STUDENT: So when it condenses,
heat is given off?

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.600
PROFESSOR: Heat is given off.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:23.900
Right.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.167
Exactly.

00:26:31.333 --> 00:26:32.600
Here's another cumulo-nimbus.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.300
Now the bottom of it is obscured
by other clouds, so

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.967
I've taken a bit of a risk in
calling it nimbus, because I

00:26:39.967 --> 00:26:42.100
can't see the rain coming
out the bottom.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.700
But I can see the anvil.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.833
That air has risen, hit the
stable stratosphere, and

00:26:49.833 --> 00:26:54.367
spread out a little bit in the
shape of a blacksmith's anvil.

00:26:54.367 --> 00:26:58.000
So we call it an anvil.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.500
Usually by the time it's done
that, there is rain coming out

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:01.967
of the bottom.

00:27:01.967 --> 00:27:05.400
So I'm going to take a chance
and call that one also

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.033
cumulo-nimbus.

00:27:07.033 --> 00:27:09.933
It's probably going to have
liquid water down here

00:27:09.933 --> 00:27:11.800
probably some ice at the top.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:20.300
Sometimes underneath the anvil
you get a rather famous and

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.467
interesting cloud structure
called mammatus.

00:27:24.467 --> 00:27:28.567
Air that's been carried up to
the tropopause, and spread out

00:27:28.567 --> 00:27:31.800
because it can't rise any
further, then begins to

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.500
descend again in lumps.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.633
And when the lighting is
correct, as it was here, when

00:27:40.633 --> 00:27:45.000
the sun is low in the sky and
is illuminating these things

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.767
kind of from the side, they
take a rather dramatic

00:27:47.767 --> 00:27:53.667
appearance of smooth descending
blobs of cloudy air

00:27:53.667 --> 00:27:55.267
coming out of the bottom
of the anvils.

00:27:55.267 --> 00:27:57.833
It's called mammatus.

00:27:57.833 --> 00:28:00.433
The origin is, I
think, evident.

00:28:04.267 --> 00:28:08.533
My favorite cloud is the
lenticular cloud.

00:28:08.533 --> 00:28:11.533
When air is forced to rise over
a mountain range, it's

00:28:11.533 --> 00:28:15.867
lifted temporarily, and then
sinks on the backside.

00:28:15.867 --> 00:28:20.400
And when it's lifted it'll reach
the saturation point,

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.033
perhaps cloud will form.

00:28:23.033 --> 00:28:26.967
But then as that air descends
back down the lee side of the

00:28:26.967 --> 00:28:32.700
mountain, everything reverses,
and the excess water will

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.967
evaporate, and you get
back to clear sky.

00:28:34.967 --> 00:28:36.667
So we're only seeing
half of it here.

00:28:36.667 --> 00:28:44.733
But this is a case looking
northwest from a point that is

00:28:44.733 --> 00:28:46.533
east of the Sierra
Nevada range.

00:28:46.533 --> 00:28:50.933
So the air is rising here,
forming that cloud--

00:28:50.933 --> 00:28:53.533
we don't see the other side of
it here-- the remarkable thing

00:28:53.533 --> 00:28:58.900
is that cloud stays more or
less steady as the air

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.100
continues to flow through it.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.933
So the cloud is fixed, but new
air parcels are entering and

00:29:04.933 --> 00:29:07.733
leaving, entering and leaving,
entering and leaving, and the

00:29:07.733 --> 00:29:10.167
cloud just stays there more
or less in the same place.

00:29:10.167 --> 00:29:12.933
You may see it wiggle around a
little bit, but generally it

00:29:12.933 --> 00:29:13.900
just stays there.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.933
Remarkable to see.

00:29:16.933 --> 00:29:19.433
Here's one over Mount Fuji.

00:29:19.433 --> 00:29:22.000
Lenticular cloud.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.433
Sometimes it's even
hard to know which

00:29:23.433 --> 00:29:24.433
way the air is blowing.

00:29:24.433 --> 00:29:26.467
I think the air is from
left to right here.

00:29:26.467 --> 00:29:30.800
It's rising, a cloud is forming,
then when the air

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.700
descends, that condensed water
evaporates again, and the

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.533
parcel goes back to
just clear air.

00:29:38.533 --> 00:29:42.567
Water vapor only, no
condensed water.

00:29:42.567 --> 00:29:45.700
These occur in a variety of
different configurations.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.333
I like this one.

00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:52.967
This is called the pile
of plates lenticular.

00:29:52.967 --> 00:29:54.500
Now why does it look
like this?

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.067
There's one mountain range.

00:29:56.067 --> 00:29:58.300
The air is rising up over
it and then sinking.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.467
Why that structure?

00:29:59.467 --> 00:30:01.367
That structure can
only be there--

00:30:01.367 --> 00:30:03.033
I thought about this for years--
there's only one

00:30:03.033 --> 00:30:05.333
possible explanation that
I can come up with.

00:30:05.333 --> 00:30:09.467
And that is at the water vapor
upwind of this region was

00:30:09.467 --> 00:30:11.733
layered a little bit.

00:30:11.733 --> 00:30:13.967
A moist layer dry layer,
moist layer, dry layer.

00:30:13.967 --> 00:30:14.533
Moist. Dry.

00:30:14.533 --> 00:30:15.933
Moist. Dry.

00:30:15.933 --> 00:30:20.200
Then when the whole thing was
lifted, the moist layers came

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.100
to saturation.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.033
The dry layers, with roughly
the same amount

00:30:25.033 --> 00:30:26.267
of lifting did not.

00:30:29.767 --> 00:30:30.967
The moist layers
formed a cloud.

00:30:30.967 --> 00:30:34.200
The dry layers formed the
interleaving dry air.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.100
And then, of course, when the
air descends back down the lee

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.733
side, all the condensed
water re-evaporates.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.033
These things are sometimes found
right, almost connected

00:30:46.033 --> 00:30:47.567
with a mountain range as
you see them there.

00:30:47.567 --> 00:30:50.900
But sometimes they're quite some
distance above or even

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.000
displaced from the mountain, in
which case they have been

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.467
very frequently identified
as UFOs,

00:30:57.467 --> 00:30:59.333
unidentified flying objects.

00:30:59.333 --> 00:31:05.100
In fact, a very large fraction
of the UFO reports over the

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:11.200
last 100 years can ultimately
be explained in terms of

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.467
lenticular clouds.

00:31:13.467 --> 00:31:17.333
So be skeptical of
the UFOs enough.

00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:20.000
The first place I would look
for an explanation of a new

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.233
sighting would be to see if it's
in a mountainous area,

00:31:23.233 --> 00:31:25.667
see if the atmospheric
conditions were right to form

00:31:25.667 --> 00:31:31.967
this kind of local smooth uplift
more or less stationary

00:31:31.967 --> 00:31:38.400
because of the way this
cloud is formed.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.367
Now that covers most of the
clouds, but I wanted to be

00:31:43.367 --> 00:31:47.167
sure your background was a
little bit broader than this.

00:31:47.167 --> 00:31:49.533
So I want to talk about
vortices for a minute.

00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:49.933
Question?

00:31:49.933 --> 00:31:50.167
Yes.

00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:52.867
STUDENT: You said there was
the right atmospheric

00:31:52.867 --> 00:31:54.800
condition to form those
lenticular clouds.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.267
What is that?

00:31:56.267 --> 00:32:00.267
PROFESSOR: Well if the air was
too dry to begin with, and you

00:32:00.267 --> 00:32:03.767
only lifted it a few hundred
meters, you wouldn't bring it

00:32:03.767 --> 00:32:04.667
to saturation.

00:32:04.667 --> 00:32:06.933
It wouldn't be enough.

00:32:06.933 --> 00:32:10.300
It's got to be humid enough, at
least in those layers, and

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.500
the mountain's got to be high
enough to lift it to

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.600
saturation.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.967
You don't bring it to
saturation, then you won't get

00:32:16.967 --> 00:32:19.733
the cloud forming.

00:32:19.733 --> 00:32:23.967
Anything else on these clouds?

00:32:23.967 --> 00:32:26.767
So, vortices.

00:32:26.767 --> 00:32:30.567
Intense vortices, no matter how
they're formed, have low

00:32:30.567 --> 00:32:33.267
pressure in the middle.

00:32:33.267 --> 00:32:36.300
If you don't believe this, take
a bucket of water and

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:40.300
reach in with your hand and
get it swirling very fast.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.800
You'll notice that the surface
of the water in the middle is

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.133
drawn down in the middle.

00:32:46.133 --> 00:32:48.300
You can do it with a glass
of water, too, at lunch.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.000
Just get it swirling, and you'll
see that in the middle,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.933
the water's drawn down.

00:32:52.933 --> 00:32:55.767
Hydrostatically that tells you
there's a lower pressure in

00:32:55.767 --> 00:32:57.500
the middle of the vortex.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:01.067
It has to be that way for
centrifugal force to be

00:33:01.067 --> 00:33:03.967
balanced by a pressure gradient
force in there.

00:33:03.967 --> 00:33:06.000
But that's not our
primary focus.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.333
So if you accept the fact that
there's low pressure in the

00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:11.700
middle of a vortex, if you take
an air parcel that has a

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.467
certain amount of water vapor
in it, and you move it into

00:33:15.467 --> 00:33:19.133
the center that vortex
somehow, its

00:33:19.133 --> 00:33:21.400
pressure will drop.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.100
Well, what happens when you
drop the pressure of air?

00:33:27.133 --> 00:33:32.267
It expands and cools by
adiabatic expansion.

00:33:32.267 --> 00:33:34.667
Until this moment, I've been
talking about adiabatic

00:33:34.667 --> 00:33:38.067
expansion as if the only way
you can do it is by lifting

00:33:38.067 --> 00:33:42.067
air into lower pressure
regions.

00:33:42.067 --> 00:33:44.333
But here's another way you could
do it just by taking a

00:33:44.333 --> 00:33:48.267
parcel of air from outside and
putting it inside a vortex.

00:33:48.267 --> 00:33:49.867
You can drop its pressure.

00:33:49.867 --> 00:33:52.567
You could make it expand
adiabatically, drop the

00:33:52.567 --> 00:33:54.133
temperature, drop
the saturation.

00:33:54.133 --> 00:33:58.233
The whole story continues, is
the same, drop the saturation

00:33:58.233 --> 00:34:02.733
vapor pressure and
a cloud can form.

00:34:02.733 --> 00:34:03.967
So a tornado.

00:34:07.233 --> 00:34:08.733
The main-- this part of a
tornado is called the

00:34:08.733 --> 00:34:10.167
condensation funnel.

00:34:10.167 --> 00:34:13.967
Now sometimes another funnel is
identified near the bottom,

00:34:13.967 --> 00:34:15.700
and you can begin to
see evidence of it

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.700
here, the dark region.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:20.800
That's called the
debris funnel.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.233
That's material that's been
kicked up off the surface and

00:34:23.233 --> 00:34:24.533
is being carried upwards.

00:34:24.533 --> 00:34:25.500
I'm not talking about that.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.200
I'm talking about this,
actually much

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.700
more spectacular funnel.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.300
That is just a cloud.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:36.933
That's just condensed water
vapor to form cloud droplets,

00:34:36.933 --> 00:34:39.900
because air from out here is
getting into there, and

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.533
there's low pressure
in the middle.

00:34:42.533 --> 00:34:46.533
That's just another example of
adiabatic expansion causing a

00:34:46.533 --> 00:34:49.100
cloud to form, in
this case, the

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.100
condensation funnel of a
tornado.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.200
Questions on that?

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.367
We'll talk more about tornadoes
later in the course.

00:35:01.433 --> 00:35:03.600
Pretend you didn't look
at that for a moment.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.967
As you first looked at that
image you may say, well he

00:35:06.967 --> 00:35:09.033
already showed us
that, didn't he?

00:35:09.033 --> 00:35:13.367
He showed us contrails
earlier in the day.

00:35:13.367 --> 00:35:16.933
But take a closer look at that
airplane and where the

00:35:16.933 --> 00:35:20.300
vortices are coming from.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.100
And they're vortices, these
little cloud lines.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.100
They're not coming
from the engines.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:29.067
Actually, they're coming from
the ends of the flaps.

00:35:29.067 --> 00:35:31.500
That pilot, he's got his
landing gear down.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.300
He's got his flaps down
to get extra lift.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.433
And he's producing little
wingtip, vortices, not exactly

00:35:38.433 --> 00:35:41.667
off the wingtip, but off
the edge of the flaps.

00:35:41.667 --> 00:35:44.667
That's a trailing vortex.

00:35:44.667 --> 00:35:47.633
There's low pressure inside.

00:35:47.633 --> 00:35:50.133
And the low pressure is causing
some water vapor to

00:35:50.133 --> 00:35:53.633
condense, to form cloud
droplets inside

00:35:53.633 --> 00:35:56.167
that trailing vortex.

00:35:56.167 --> 00:35:59.367
So be sure you can distinguish
that from the--

00:35:59.367 --> 00:36:00.433
from the contrails.

00:36:00.433 --> 00:36:00.933
Yes?

00:36:00.933 --> 00:36:04.200
STUDENT: How does that
create low pressure?

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:08.900
PROFESSOR: Well, you know as a--
in order for an aircraft

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:13.267
to fly it has to have fast air
moving over the top of the

00:36:13.267 --> 00:36:19.867
wing, which by Bernoulli's law
gives you low pressure, and

00:36:19.867 --> 00:36:23.567
higher pressure at the bottom,
near the end of that wing.

00:36:23.567 --> 00:36:25.567
Because you have high pressure
and low pressure, the high

00:36:25.567 --> 00:36:28.700
pressure air whips surround and
forms the trailing vortex

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.200
that comes off the wing tip.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.700
But remember, just like the
tornado the fact that there's

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.500
swirling air in that ensures
that there's going to be lower

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.400
pressure in the middle than
there is outside.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.167
STUDENT: How common is this?

00:36:41.167 --> 00:36:46.000
PROFESSOR: Well again, the
humidity has to be high in

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
order for that little bit
of pressure drop.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.067
So I'd say a picture like this
is relatively rare, because

00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:56.267
you probably would have to have
humidity higher than 95%

00:36:56.267 --> 00:37:01.600
preexisting in order to get
that kind of a phenomenon.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:11.967
There's another way to get the
sudden drop in pressure.

00:37:11.967 --> 00:37:15.400
And this is off of an aircraft
flying supersonically.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.400
It's flying very rapidly through
the atmosphere, faster

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.733
than the speed of sound.

00:37:18.733 --> 00:37:22.600
It has its own characteristic
flow field around aircraft

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.000
when it's flying that fast,
and its own characteristic

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.267
pressure anomalies.

00:37:28.267 --> 00:37:33.867
Normally a supersonic aircraft
where it parts the air gets

00:37:33.867 --> 00:37:38.567
high pressure, and where the air
is coming back again near

00:37:38.567 --> 00:37:41.300
the rear of the aircraft, you're
getting lower pressure,

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.433
even lower than ambient.

00:37:44.433 --> 00:37:45.767
Even lower than ambient.

00:37:48.333 --> 00:37:51.100
And we will see what
this does to the

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.467
thermodynamics of the air.

00:37:54.467 --> 00:37:59.067
Air entering that lower pressure
region on the back of

00:37:59.067 --> 00:38:04.400
the aircraft will adiabatically
expand and so

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.033
on, and so on.

00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:06.233
And a cloud will form.

00:38:06.233 --> 00:38:08.700
It's the same procedure
we've talked about.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.033
Let's take a look at what
that looks like.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.033
How many have seen that kind
of diagram before?

00:38:16.033 --> 00:38:17.300
Only a few of you.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:21.933
I am intrigued by this, partly
as a pilot but mostly just

00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:26.500
as-- just for the beauty
and wonder of that.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.000
Your first thought may be,
well, there is something

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.633
there, and the aircraft is just
flying through it, like

00:38:33.633 --> 00:38:36.367
some kind of a membrane, or
something in the aircraft.

00:38:36.367 --> 00:38:36.600
No.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.133
No.

00:38:37.133 --> 00:38:39.967
The aircraft is flying
supersonically, perhaps 1000

00:38:39.967 --> 00:38:41.200
miles per hour.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:45.600
And this is moving along with
it, exactly following it.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.433
Tied to it.

00:38:47.433 --> 00:38:49.500
Notice there's another
one, little one,

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.667
just behind the cockpit.

00:38:50.667 --> 00:38:53.400
There's a little bit of a low
pressure area there, and a

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.700
bigger low pressure area there
on the rear of the aircraft.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.767
And the air parcels, which were
sub-saturated here, have

00:39:00.767 --> 00:39:03.000
entered this low
pressure area.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.100
And the story is the same.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:08.700
Adiabatic expansion, cloud
formation, and then when you

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.233
get beyond, that the pressure
jumps up again.

00:39:11.233 --> 00:39:15.000
The process reverses, and
the cloud disappears.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.733
Question in the back.

00:39:15.733 --> 00:39:18.867
STUDENT: What is the difference
between adiabatic

00:39:18.867 --> 00:39:21.800
cooling and adiabatic
expansion?

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:25.700
PROFESSOR: Adiabatic expansion
is, they're

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.200
almost the same thing.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.533
When you have adiabatic
expansion, you

00:39:29.533 --> 00:39:31.833
get adiabatic cooling.

00:39:31.833 --> 00:39:35.800
Adiabatic expansion is defined
as expanding air without

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.567
adding heat.

00:39:36.567 --> 00:39:39.800
The word adiabatic means
without adding heat.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.300
When you do that, when you
expand air without adding

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:47.500
heat, you cool it by the work
that it does on its

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.267
environment.

00:39:48.267 --> 00:39:49.867
In other words, you drop
the temperature.

00:39:49.867 --> 00:39:52.700
So those are almost synonymous,
but one

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.500
leads to the other.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.733
Does that help?

00:39:58.733 --> 00:40:02.000
Then one more example of this.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.900
I call that the fighter plane
wearing a tutu picture.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.567
Again, this is moving
with that aircraft.

00:40:09.567 --> 00:40:13.700
This is not so common because
the humidity probably has to

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:19.633
be something like 95%, 96%,
97% in order to get that

00:40:19.633 --> 00:40:23.000
phenomenon to occur when the
aircraft flies through it.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.100
STUDENT: Isn't that at
higher altitudes?

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.800
PROFESSOR: Not necessarily.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.233
It could be at any altitude,
but the relative humidity

00:40:29.233 --> 00:40:33.700
would have to be high to begin
with, the relative humidity.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.933
Questions on this?

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.100
Haze and pollution.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.133
We talked about this
a little bit.

00:40:41.133 --> 00:40:45.633
If the air is polluted and the
particles are hydroscopic,

00:40:45.633 --> 00:40:49.233
that is, they like to attract
water, then even if the

00:40:49.233 --> 00:40:52.333
relative humidity is less than
100%, they may attract a

00:40:52.333 --> 00:40:55.933
little bit of water on to them
and make themselves bigger.

00:40:55.933 --> 00:41:00.567
When they do that it's called
haze, and it reduces the

00:41:00.567 --> 00:41:02.900
visual range.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:06.400
Take a look at this photo.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.100
Here's a nearby forest. There's
a forest on a somewhat

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.100
more distant hill.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:15.167
And a forest on an even
more distant hill.

00:41:15.167 --> 00:41:19.800
This is up in Maine, I think,
one of my summer vacations.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.833
Those three surfaces are pretty
much identical, and yet

00:41:22.833 --> 00:41:25.467
that looks lighter and
bluer than this.

00:41:25.467 --> 00:41:28.433
And this looks lighter
and bluer than that.

00:41:28.433 --> 00:41:33.233
What's happening is if there's
haze in the air, and sunlight

00:41:33.233 --> 00:41:37.367
is being scattered by that
haze to your eye.

00:41:37.367 --> 00:41:39.300
So the further away the object
is-- the further away the

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:48.467
object is, it's not the darker
that it looks, the lighter it

00:41:48.467 --> 00:41:54.733
looks because you're adding what
I call path radiance to

00:41:54.733 --> 00:41:56.133
what you're seeing.

00:41:56.133 --> 00:41:59.833
And of course as the air becomes
more and more humid,

00:41:59.833 --> 00:42:01.667
those particles will grow
a little bit more.

00:42:01.667 --> 00:42:03.333
That mountain may disappear.

00:42:03.333 --> 00:42:06.133
That mountain may come to
look like that mountain.

00:42:06.133 --> 00:42:08.867
And so this can be sometimes--

00:42:08.867 --> 00:42:11.233
of course, you need the
particles, but the humidity

00:42:11.233 --> 00:42:13.300
plays a role as well.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:18.467
How much water condenses onto
those haze particles.

00:42:18.467 --> 00:42:20.633
Clouds seen from space.

00:42:20.633 --> 00:42:25.867
These are some fair weather
cumulus clouds over Central

00:42:25.867 --> 00:42:27.900
South America, equatorial
South America

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.833
near the Ucayali River.

00:42:30.833 --> 00:42:33.600
They're just fair weather
cumulus clouds, but they're

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.167
forming in rows.

00:42:35.167 --> 00:42:38.833
Those are called cloud streets
in the literature.

00:42:38.833 --> 00:42:42.667
And they are just fair weather
cumulus clouds caused by the

00:42:42.667 --> 00:42:44.367
heating of the ground
by the sun.

00:42:44.367 --> 00:42:49.233
But if there's a wind blowing,
cumulus clouds tend to line up

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:52.933
in rows, or we use
the word streets.

00:42:52.933 --> 00:42:56.267
And so I know from this image
that the wind is blowing

00:42:56.267 --> 00:43:01.367
either in that direction or in
that direction because clouds

00:43:01.367 --> 00:43:05.967
line up with the wind to form
that kind of a pattern.

00:43:05.967 --> 00:43:09.467
If I would guess, I'd suspect
it's from upper-left to

00:43:09.467 --> 00:43:10.167
lower-right.

00:43:10.167 --> 00:43:11.933
But I know it's always
parallel to the

00:43:11.933 --> 00:43:13.667
wind in that case.

00:43:13.667 --> 00:43:17.467
This is hard to see sometimes
from the ground because you

00:43:17.467 --> 00:43:19.367
may see a cloud over there, and
a cloud over there, but

00:43:19.367 --> 00:43:21.967
it's hard to make out this
pattern, because you're too

00:43:21.967 --> 00:43:23.767
close to it.

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:26.967
Being up in a satellite, you get
to see the whole pattern.

00:43:26.967 --> 00:43:29.400
And, of course, that's really
true for larger scale cloud

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.467
patterns like this.

00:43:30.467 --> 00:43:32.633
Here's North America.

00:43:32.633 --> 00:43:36.067
Here's a beautiful mid-latitudes
cyclone.

00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:40.000
The cyclone center is here,
occluded front back to here,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.867
warm front, cold front.

00:43:41.867 --> 00:43:44.067
Now if you're at any location
all you see

00:43:44.067 --> 00:43:49.067
is overcast or clear.

00:43:49.067 --> 00:43:51.400
But from far enough away, from
up in space, you could see

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.200
this is part of a beautiful--

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.900
we call that a comma
cloud, because as

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:56.800
the shape of a comma.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.767
But that's a beautiful
indication of what's called a

00:43:59.767 --> 00:44:02.233
mid-latitude frontal cyclone.

00:44:02.233 --> 00:44:05.333
And we'll be talking about the
structure of these later on in

00:44:05.333 --> 00:44:06.967
the course.

00:44:06.967 --> 00:44:11.567
Thunderstorms look like
this from space.

00:44:11.567 --> 00:44:13.100
They have an anvil.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.267
We've spoken about that.

00:44:14.267 --> 00:44:18.133
That's kind of a flat part where
it's hit the tropopause

00:44:18.133 --> 00:44:23.000
and can't go any higher
so it spreads out.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.567
The main updraft is usually
where this bumpy part is.

00:44:26.567 --> 00:44:30.333
The main updraft is there and
hits, spreads out, and forms a

00:44:30.333 --> 00:44:33.933
big, big anvil.

00:44:33.933 --> 00:44:36.567
Hurricane looks like this.

00:44:36.567 --> 00:44:39.400
There's the eye of the hurricane
rising air, big

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.367
anvil spiraling outwards.

00:44:41.367 --> 00:44:46.167
Clear skies from scattered
cumulus other places, but,

00:44:46.167 --> 00:44:49.767
again, you need to be on a
satellite to see that big,

00:44:49.767 --> 00:44:51.633
that big pattern there.

00:44:51.633 --> 00:44:54.500
We're almost done, but I want
to remind you that we're

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:55.233
talking about clouds.

00:44:55.233 --> 00:44:59.267
We're talking about
liquid and/or ice.

00:44:59.267 --> 00:45:01.867
It's a condensed phase of water,
but it could be liquid

00:45:01.867 --> 00:45:03.200
and/or ice.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.800
If the temperature is higher
than zero degrees Celsius,

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.533
it's always going
to be liquid.

00:45:10.533 --> 00:45:15.833
If the temperature is colder
than minus 40 Celsius, it's

00:45:15.833 --> 00:45:18.133
always going to be ice.

00:45:18.133 --> 00:45:20.467
But if it's in this intermediate
range, this

00:45:20.467 --> 00:45:25.267
rather wide intermediate range,
of zero Celsius down to

00:45:25.267 --> 00:45:29.633
minus 40, it could be either
liquid or ice.

00:45:29.633 --> 00:45:32.233
If it's liquid, we call it
supercooled liquid because it

00:45:32.233 --> 00:45:37.367
is below its normal
freezing point.

00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:39.000
There's a definition.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.833
It's very dangerous for ships
and aircraft, because that ice

00:45:42.833 --> 00:45:44.267
will freeze on contact.

00:45:44.267 --> 00:45:47.600
For example, here's a wing of an
aircraft that's been flying

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:52.533
through a cloud that had
supercooled water in it.

00:45:52.533 --> 00:45:56.867
Those little cloud particles
froze on contact with the wing

00:45:56.867 --> 00:46:03.500
and formed this rather ugly and
poorly aerodynamic shape,

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.867
making it very difficult for
that aircraft to fly.

00:46:05.867 --> 00:46:09.167
A large number of accidents
and fatalities have arisen

00:46:09.167 --> 00:46:11.467
from this kind of a problem.

00:46:11.467 --> 00:46:14.067
The only thing to do is to
quickly get out of that

00:46:14.067 --> 00:46:17.067
condition and help to melt it
off, or have some special

00:46:17.067 --> 00:46:20.533
technology on the wing that
will throw off that ice,

00:46:20.533 --> 00:46:25.467
either by heating or by
what's called a--

00:46:25.467 --> 00:46:29.600
well it's a rubber thing that
can be expanded to actually

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.500
physically knock off the ice.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:35.200
A boot it's called a
boot in that case.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:42.067
When riming forms on the ship,
you get supercooled cloud

00:46:42.067 --> 00:46:45.600
droplets passing over a ship
and it forms. That's very

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.433
dangerous because that'll
add mass to the

00:46:48.433 --> 00:46:51.000
upper part of the ship.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.867
And the moment you add too much
to that, the ship will

00:46:53.867 --> 00:46:59.033
then spontaneously turn over,
and everyone will be lost. You

00:46:59.033 --> 00:47:01.700
really have to get the sailors
out there chipping away at

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.833
that ice, because it has a very
dangerous weight to the

00:47:04.833 --> 00:47:07.833
top of the ship when supercooled
water is

00:47:07.833 --> 00:47:10.900
collecting like that.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.800
Here's a case you can see
from time to time.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:18.433
Here's a layer of probably
alto-cumulus that's liquid.

00:47:21.067 --> 00:47:25.100
Then, for some reason, and this
is below the freezing

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.700
point, maybe it's minus
20 Celsius.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.333
For some reason in some area
that liquid has frozen

00:47:31.333 --> 00:47:34.400
spontaneously forming snowflakes
and they're falling

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.433
out, leaving a little clear
space in the cloud, and a

00:47:37.433 --> 00:47:43.033
little plume of falling
snowflakes out of that region.

00:47:43.033 --> 00:47:44.967
Look for this over the next
winter. if you look hard

00:47:44.967 --> 00:47:47.233
enough, you'll probably find
a case or two of this.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.188
Professor Langdon
Hammer: I have in the

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:07.420
chairman's office down the hall
two photographs.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.885
One is of the Yale English
Department in 1924,

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:17.542
and there are a number of
distinguished gentlemen casually

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:23.154
posed in it;
distinguished scholars but all

00:00:23.154 --> 00:00:27.202
gentlemen.
Come by and take a look at it

00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:30.521
sometime.
I also have a photograph from

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:34.881
1967 in which there are more
distinguished gentlemen,

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:40.193
less casually posed;
in fact, arrayed in a sort of

00:00:40.193 --> 00:00:46.260
phalanx, and seated in the
middle of these men is one

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.060
woman, Marie Borroff.
 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.246
Marie is our guest lecturer
today and I'm delighted to have

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:57.155
her here.
She has been a member of this

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:00.607
English Department and a
distinguished member of this

00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:03.130
English Department for a long
time.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.176
She is a medievalist,
a scholar of modern poetry,

00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:16.230
a translator of Middle English
poetry, a poet herself;

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.585
and she views poetry--or I
think of you,

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:27.174
Marie, as holding a sense of
poetry as a long tradition that

00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:33.874
reaches back to the origins of
our language and is alive with

00:01:33.874 --> 00:01:38.053
us today,
and that writing about it,

00:01:38.053 --> 00:01:43.060
writing it, and translating it
are your activities,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.489
and also teaching it.
 

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:51.876
And Marie is one of our best
and most revered teachers in the

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:54.480
history of this department.
 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.193
So, it's a really wonderful
honor for me to get to give the

00:01:59.193 --> 00:02:02.770
stage and the microphone to
Marie Borroff.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.690
Would you please welcome her.
 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.920
 
 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.139
Professor Marie Borroff:
Thank you Lanny.

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.873
I'm getting over a virus,
so I hope my voice won't be too

00:02:15.873 --> 00:02:17.550
scratchy.
I have some water to help.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.099
 
 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.308
I think of it as,
it's really all the same thing:

00:02:25.308 --> 00:02:28.289
Beowulf, Galloway,
Chaucer, Milton,

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:32.059
Wallace Stevens – it's all
the same thing,

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:36.213
in a sense.
I want to begin this morning

00:02:36.213 --> 00:02:41.065
with a little poem that you may
never have heard of,

00:02:41.065 --> 00:02:45.251
or read, by Wallace Stevens
called "Gubbinal"

00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:47.440
(g-u-b-b-i-n-a-l).
 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.020
And if you have the poems of
Stevens here you can look at it,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.740
if you want,
though it doesn't matter.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.349
I'm going to tell you it.
 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.460
That strange flower,
the sun,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.240
Is just what you say,
Have it your way.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.920
The world is ugly,
And the people are sad.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.920
That tuft of jungle feathers,
That animal eye,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.130
Is just what you say.
 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.880
That savage of fire,
That seed,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.080
Have it your way.
 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.169
The world is ugly,
And the people are sad.

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.765
In this poem,
the voice of the imagination in

00:03:32.765 --> 00:03:37.178
Stevens's concept of the
Imagination – with a capital

00:03:37.178 --> 00:03:41.881
l – speaks,
and it addresses a "you" that

00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:45.379
views the world without
imagination;

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.342
that is, you – the "you" of
the poem – you take the sun

00:03:50.342 --> 00:03:53.299
for granted.
You aren't excited by seeing

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.692
it, by the thought of it,
by the fact that it has risen

00:03:56.692 --> 00:04:00.400
on this particular day and you
hope it's going to rise again

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.513
tomorrow.
You don't feel,

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:07.202
as Stevens puts it in another
poem, "the sun comes up like

00:04:07.202 --> 00:04:08.930
news from Africa."
 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.241
And that's how one with the
imagination at work feels about

00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:17.398
the sun.
Imagination,

00:04:17.398 --> 00:04:22.118
as Stevens conceives of it,
is the incessant stream of

00:04:22.118 --> 00:04:27.639
language emanating from the
human consciousness as we live,

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.817
expressing both the state of
the world at a given time and

00:04:32.817 --> 00:04:36.269
its own state,
both of which states are

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:38.450
constantly changing.
 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.069
Our inner state changes.
 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:44.159
Our inner weather changes,
as the outer weather of the

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.399
world changes and as the seasons
change.

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:52.396
The work of the imagination,
as represented in "Gubbinal,"

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:55.290
is the generation of metaphors.
 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.628
The sun is a "strange flower,"
a "tuft of jungle feathers," an

00:05:01.628 --> 00:05:06.720
"animal eye," a "savage of
fire," and a "seed."

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.037
And one thing that's important
about this to notice is the

00:05:11.037 --> 00:05:15.960
rapidity with which one metaphor
gives way to another metaphor.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.499
You don't stick with one;
you don't have a definitive one

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:21.779
that is it.
You go on.

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.269
And if the poem were longer
there'd be more metaphors still.

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:31.290
The mind is in motion,
as the world also is in motion.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.923
Implicit in this poem also is
Stevens's particular concept of

00:05:37.923 --> 00:05:41.486
happiness.
Without the imagination,

00:05:41.486 --> 00:05:45.399
the poem says,
"the world is ugly / and the

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:49.733
people are sad."
And we can turn this statement

00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:53.151
on its head and say,
with equal validity,

00:05:53.151 --> 00:05:57.680
from Steven's point of view,
with the imagination.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.094
When the vital imagination is
in residence and at work,

00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:06.182
the world is splendid,
exciting, and the people are

00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:08.996
happy.
Note that happiness has nothing

00:06:08.996 --> 00:06:12.732
to do with personal fortune,
with the fact that you've been

00:06:12.732 --> 00:06:15.952
accepted by Harvard Medical
School or you performed

00:06:15.952 --> 00:06:20.009
brilliantly on the basketball
court or the football field,

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.769
or got the date you were hoping
to get.

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:27.100
Happiness is internal,
independent,

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.922
self-starting,
but also shared,

00:06:30.922 --> 00:06:35.829
communal, human.
The work of the imagination,

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:39.284
for Stevens,
is the same as the writing of

00:06:39.284 --> 00:06:43.750
poetry: the generation of poetry
on a small scale,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.041
as in "Gubbinal" and many other
such, or on a large mythical

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:52.540
scale, as in "The Auroras of
Autumn."

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.713
A lot of Stevens's early poems
are called, by him,

00:06:57.713 --> 00:07:00.287
anecdotes.
Now, an anecdote,

00:07:00.287 --> 00:07:04.596
if you go back to the etymology
of the word, is something

00:07:04.596 --> 00:07:07.500
unpublished.
It's like a draft.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.669
And what Stevens would do--He
lived in Hartford,

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.220
as you probably know.
 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.507
He worked in a big insurance
company, it was very successful,

00:07:15.507 --> 00:07:18.794
and he would walk every morning
– he was a great walker –

00:07:18.794 --> 00:07:21.808
from his home in West Hartford
to his office in downtown

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:22.630
Hartford.
 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.779
 
 

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.015
As he walked,
he would write poems,

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:31.490
poems would come to him.
 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.241
He once said,
"I never like anything that

00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:37.199
doesn't fly in at me through the
window."

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:40.625
He'd get to the office,
he'd call on his secretary,

00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:44.804
and he'd dictate the poems he
had thought of on the way to the

00:07:44.804 --> 00:07:46.860
office on separate sheets.
 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.381
She would give him the poems,
he'd put them in a desk drawer,

00:07:50.381 --> 00:07:53.668
and then in about a month he'd
go through what was in the

00:07:53.668 --> 00:07:56.779
drawer and throw some of them
away and keep some.

00:07:56.779 --> 00:08:00.762
And the ones he kept would go
into whatever book it was that

00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:04.794
he was writing.
Oh to have his wastebaskets,

00:08:04.794 --> 00:08:08.691
is what I say!
I dare to think that Stevens

00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:12.386
would have liked,
or at least approved of the

00:08:12.386 --> 00:08:16.015
idea of,
the first stanza of a poem I

00:08:16.015 --> 00:08:20.652
wrote many years ago,
when I was getting up early

00:08:20.652 --> 00:08:25.579
enough in March to see the sun
rise: "Black rim,

00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:33.357
pale dawn, now as to rolling
drums, sun, your great signal

00:08:33.357 --> 00:08:36.360
comes to bid me on."
 

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.220
But Stevens said it less
pretentiously and better.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.210
He wrote:
The sun, that brave man,

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.680
Comes through boughs that lie
in wait,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.460
That brave man.
… [I'm skipping a little.]

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.922
Fears of my bed,
Fears of life and fears of

00:08:55.922 --> 00:08:58.090
death,
Run away.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:02.394
That brave man comes up
From below and walks without

00:09:02.394 --> 00:09:05.450
meditation,
That brave man.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.692
And if you can think of the sun
as a brave man,

00:09:08.692 --> 00:09:11.230
you're well into Stevens,
I think.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:16.634
I'm sure Stevens would have
liked a story that I'm about to

00:09:16.634 --> 00:09:20.059
tell you.
When I was teaching Stevens

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:25.481
years ago, among other poets in
my course in twentieth-century

00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:28.554
poetry,
I was walking on campus one day

00:09:28.554 --> 00:09:32.078
and I ran into one of my
students, and we were just

00:09:32.078 --> 00:09:33.769
reading Stevens then.
 

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:36.090
And I said to him,
"Well, how are you?

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.730
How goes it, how are things?"
 

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:38.799
He said, "Oh, I'm fine."
 

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:42.999
He said, "All my friends are
depressed, but when I hear how

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:46.566
depressed they are,
I look at them and I think,

00:09:46.566 --> 00:09:49.824
'Have it your way,
the world is ugly and the

00:09:49.824 --> 00:09:53.677
people are sad.'"
And Stevens would have liked

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:58.686
that because Stevens said that,
strangely, that poetry should

00:09:58.686 --> 00:10:02.610
make us happy,
should help to make us happy.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.424
He also said – this is rather
hard to swallow perhaps for

00:10:06.424 --> 00:10:10.369
someone who's been struggling
with "The Auroras of Autumn" or

00:10:10.369 --> 00:10:14.578
"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction"
or any of the other big ones –

00:10:14.578 --> 00:10:18.590
people should enjoy poetry the
way a child enjoys snow.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.500
And that is true.
 

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.379
In reading Stevens,
especially reading the little

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:26.679
poems, I always say you
shouldn't worry about a poem.

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:30.086
You should read on and find one
that tickles you,

00:10:30.086 --> 00:10:32.853
that you like,
and make a mark there and

00:10:32.853 --> 00:10:36.259
return to that poem later and
read it again;

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:41.800
though, it's also important,
I know, to study Stevens,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.759
to study especially the large
poems, the big creations.

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:54.478
"The Auroras of Autumn" exists
in a sequence of seasonal poems,

00:10:54.478 --> 00:10:59.679
large-scale seasonal poems that
Stevens wrote.

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:02.574
The earliest one,
in seasonal terms,

00:11:02.574 --> 00:11:07.289
is "Notes Toward a Supreme
Fiction", and that is a poem of

00:11:07.289 --> 00:11:10.066
the spring.
And if you read it you'll see a

00:11:10.066 --> 00:11:12.396
lot of things that are
associated with spring in

00:11:12.396 --> 00:11:15.036
Connecticut.
You'll see the forget-me-not in

00:11:15.036 --> 00:11:18.706
bloom, though he calls it the
myosotis, not to be sentimental

00:11:18.706 --> 00:11:21.149
about it.
You'll hear about forsythia;

00:11:21.149 --> 00:11:24.010
you'll hear about yellow and
the blue sky.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.820
It's a spring poem.
 

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.403
Then comes "Credences of
Summer," and then comes "The

00:11:30.403 --> 00:11:31.850
Auroras of Autumn."
 

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.899
Now, these poems go
chronologically,

00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:40.125
seasonally, but they also go
chronologically in Stevens's own

00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:42.781
life.
He is older as he writes each

00:11:42.781 --> 00:11:45.617
one of them.
When he wrote "The Auroras of

00:11:45.617 --> 00:11:47.960
Autumn," he was in his
seventies.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:53.659
And this is the first of the
poems in which the idea of death

00:11:53.659 --> 00:11:58.220
comes in, dauntingly,
the idea of human death;

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:03.601
because one thing that autumn
is is the season that presages

00:12:03.601 --> 00:12:08.014
winter, winter death,
the death of the landscape in

00:12:08.014 --> 00:12:12.801
New England, and ultimately the
death of the individual human

00:12:12.801 --> 00:12:16.711
being.
And that threat comes into the

00:12:16.711 --> 00:12:20.009
poem and is faced in the poem.
 

00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:27.542
Now, I want to go back to the
beginning of the poem – so if

00:12:27.542 --> 00:12:35.451
you have a copy of it you could
look at the beginning – and go

00:12:35.451 --> 00:12:41.194
very quickly through,
say, sections one through seven

00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:46.319
maybe, because I'm going to end
by talking about sections nine

00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:50.100
and ten and something about
section eight.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:55.741
In the poem,
we see the imagination in its

00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:59.870
work as the creator of myth.
 

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.759
This has always been true of
human culture.

00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:06.106
There have always been great
myths of the world:

00:13:06.106 --> 00:13:09.240
the myth that the world rests
on a turtle,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.310
or the myth of creation,
how the world was created or

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.580
how the animals first came.
 

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:21.269
And Stevens toys with mythical
creation in the poem.

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:24.049
In particular,
in section one,

00:13:24.049 --> 00:13:29.417
he writes three different
myths, one of which succeeds to

00:13:29.417 --> 00:13:32.769
the other,
in true Stevensian fashion,

00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:36.863
because an essence of the
world, as Stevens thinks about

00:13:36.863 --> 00:13:39.618
it,
is change, as I intimated

00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:42.267
earlier.
It's hard to imagine Stevens

00:13:42.267 --> 00:13:45.706
living anywhere but in a
temperate climate where there

00:13:45.706 --> 00:13:48.224
are seasons.
It's hard to think of him as

00:13:48.224 --> 00:13:51.479
living in the tropics or in
Antarctica because he's a man of

00:13:51.479 --> 00:13:53.519
the seasons, a man of the
weather.

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:55.309
He writes a lot about the
weather.

00:13:55.309 --> 00:13:58.110
One of his poems begins,
"Lights out.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.186
Shades up.
/ A look at the weather":

00:14:01.186 --> 00:14:05.523
let's see what the weather is
tonight, on this particular

00:14:05.523 --> 00:14:08.391
night.
In the first section of "The

00:14:08.391 --> 00:14:12.346
Auroras of Autumn," there are
three different myths,

00:14:12.346 --> 00:14:16.690
one of which succeeds to
another with equal validity.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.820
They are three myths about
serpents.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:25.770
First, we have the cosmic
serpent: "the bodiless.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.690
/ His head is air."
 

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.669
I'm reading from the beginning
of the section.

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:35.881
"Beneath his tip at night /
Eyes open and fix on us in every

00:14:35.881 --> 00:14:38.583
sky."
Clearly there he is talking

00:14:38.583 --> 00:14:43.136
about the dawning of stars at
night, "eyes open and fixed on

00:14:43.136 --> 00:14:44.679
us in every sky."
 

00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:49.620
So, this is a huge cosmic
serpent that he is imagining.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.860
He's imagining the heavens as
presided over by a great serpent

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.100
which may well have something to
do with a constellation named

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.970
Draco (d-r-a-c-o),
which is "dragon" or "snake."

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:07.721
Then we throw that one away,
and Stevens says "Or is this

00:15:07.721 --> 00:15:11.201
another…?"
An "or" in Stevens always has

00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:14.370
to be answered or responded to
by saying, yes:

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.679
this is another one,
let's have another one;

00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:19.816
we've just had one,
let's throw that one out and

00:15:19.816 --> 00:15:20.679
have another one.
 

00:15:20.679 --> 00:15:24.340
The stale has to always be
thrown out.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:29.759
So now, we get a terrestrial
serpent, on a huge scale.

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:32.480
"This is where the serpent
lives";

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.240
you could underline that.
 

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.222
At the beginning of the poem,
"This is where the serpent

00:15:37.222 --> 00:15:39.740
lives."
Well, that's in line one.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.662
Now we're in line seven:
"This is where the serpent

00:15:42.662 --> 00:15:44.564
lives.
This is his nest,

00:15:44.564 --> 00:15:46.843
/ these fields,
these hills,

00:15:46.843 --> 00:15:51.400
these tinted distances,
/ and the pines above and along

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.509
and beside the sea."
 

00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:58.333
So here, we have a serpent that
is a terrestrial myth,

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:02.155
a myth of the whole,
encompassing the whole

00:16:02.155 --> 00:16:04.839
landscape.
And finally,

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:10.593
almost at the end,
"his meditations in the ferns,"

00:16:10.593 --> 00:16:13.059
can you find that?
 

00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:16.939
It's the next-to-last tercet of
that section – "his" is

00:16:16.939 --> 00:16:20.750
clearly "the serpent's"
meditations: "His meditations in

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.364
the ferns,
/ when he moved so slightly to

00:16:24.364 --> 00:16:28.330
make sure of sun / made us no
less as sure."

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:34.124
And here is a third serpent,
and this is a local serpent,

00:16:34.124 --> 00:16:39.505
a particular serpent,
a serpent visualized in sensory

00:16:39.505 --> 00:16:43.652
terms.
"We saw in his head / black

00:16:43.652 --> 00:16:49.415
beaded on the rock,
the flecked animal / The moving

00:16:49.415 --> 00:16:53.450
grass, the Indian in his glade."
 

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.480
The Indian in his glade,
the Indian's glade;

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.679
that is, the native of the soil.
 

00:16:59.679 --> 00:17:05.311
In this section we find one of
the great opposites in Stevens,

00:17:05.311 --> 00:17:08.819
the great oppositions between
pairs.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.633
Imagination and reality is,
of course, one or

00:17:11.633 --> 00:17:14.319
Imagination with a
capital I,

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.900
versus imagination with
a lowercase i;

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.529
an imagination that sort of
produces little fancies.

00:17:21.529 --> 00:17:25.505
But here, we have a strange
opposition, which is rather

00:17:25.505 --> 00:17:30.408
idiosyncratic with Stevens,
between abstraction and--not

00:17:30.408 --> 00:17:35.647
between the abstract and the
concrete, but between the

00:17:35.647 --> 00:17:39.799
abstract and the particular,
the local.

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:43.557
And with that,
very often characteristically

00:17:43.557 --> 00:17:47.839
in Stevens, there comes a flash
of the sensory,

00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:51.339
a detail of color:
"black beaded," the

00:17:51.339 --> 00:17:56.329
black-beaded head of the snake;
a particular glade in New

00:17:56.329 --> 00:18:00.740
England where Native Americans
once lived – "the Indian in

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.880
his glade" – the recognition
of that.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.079
So, this opening section of the
poem demonstrates the

00:18:09.079 --> 00:18:13.680
imagination at work as a
generator of myths.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.470
And one myth succeeds to
another myth.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.204
There's the cosmic serpent,
the terrestrial serpent,

00:18:21.204 --> 00:18:24.720
and the local serpent,
the particular serpent,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.319
the serpent that we see right
there, on a particular day.

00:18:29.319 --> 00:18:33.725
Now, something happens that's
characteristically Stevensian,

00:18:33.725 --> 00:18:37.309
and it occurs at the beginning
of section two.

00:18:37.309 --> 00:18:40.969
And this is something that not
everyone agrees on but this is

00:18:40.969 --> 00:18:42.250
how I interpret it.
 

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.226
What I'm giving you is my
interpretation of the poem,

00:18:45.226 --> 00:18:48.260
which you have to take for
better or for worse for the

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.033
moment.
"Farewell to an idea…" I take

00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:58.320
this to be the discarding of an
achieved idea and the moving on

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.450
to something else.
 

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:05.211
So, what Stevens is saying
farewell to is the whole serpent

00:19:05.211 --> 00:19:07.674
mythology: cosmic,
terrestrial,

00:19:07.674 --> 00:19:08.660
and all.
 

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:13.299
 
 

00:19:13.299 --> 00:19:17.089
And from that we turn to
something different.

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:22.579
We turn to seasonal change,
the change from summer to

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:25.091
autumn.
And another important

00:19:25.091 --> 00:19:29.180
Stevensian opposition comes into
play in this section,

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:36.392
and that is the opposition
between whiteness and color or,

00:19:36.392 --> 00:19:41.200
as Stevens often calls it,
"candor."

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.048
"Candor," as you may know,
is whiteness,

00:19:44.048 --> 00:19:47.262
and if we were true to our
Latin etymologies,

00:19:47.262 --> 00:19:50.329
all candidates would wear white
robes;

00:19:50.329 --> 00:19:53.456
of course, it's a little hard
to imagine some of them in a

00:19:53.456 --> 00:19:55.776
white robe.
At any rate,

00:19:55.776 --> 00:19:59.660
"candor" is abstract,
white.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.898
He also uses the word "blank"
in this section:

00:20:03.898 --> 00:20:08.890
"the man who is walking turns
blankly on the sand."

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:14.099
In "Notes Toward a Supreme
Fiction," the poem begins with

00:20:14.099 --> 00:20:19.216
whiteness and moves from
whiteness, from that ever-early

00:20:19.216 --> 00:20:24.285
candor, to its late plural;
from the abstract to the

00:20:24.285 --> 00:20:27.290
particular, multifarious plural.
 

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:34.430
Here summer is stale;
it's over, it has happened,

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.956
so now it's time to throw it
out and move on to something

00:20:37.956 --> 00:20:39.766
else,
namely autumn,

00:20:39.766 --> 00:20:44.057
and the whiteness is visualized
as a landscape:

00:20:44.057 --> 00:20:47.599
"A cabin stands,
/ deserted on a beach."

00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:50.448
And it's the sort of summer
cabin that we all,

00:20:50.448 --> 00:20:53.676
most of us, probably know:
a white beach and a white

00:20:53.676 --> 00:20:56.587
cabin,
probably a white fence and

00:20:56.587 --> 00:21:01.756
maybe a white enclosure for a
shower that you can take after

00:21:01.756 --> 00:21:04.599
you've swum.
It's summer.

00:21:04.599 --> 00:21:05.960
…The flowers against
the wall

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.849
Are white…
Reminding… of a white

00:21:09.849 --> 00:21:12.003
That was different,
something else,

00:21:12.003 --> 00:21:13.630
last year
Or before.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.178
…
[And now the wind is beginning

00:21:16.178 --> 00:21:18.519
to blow.
Summer is over.] The wind is

00:21:18.519 --> 00:21:21.240
blowing the sand across the
floor.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.720
Here being visible is being
white,

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.180
Is being of the solid of white,
the accomplishment

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.920
Of an extremist in an
exercise...

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.750
The season changes.
 

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.720
A cold wind chills the beach.
 

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.609
The long lines of it grow
longer, emptier,

00:21:39.609 --> 00:21:42.549
A darkness gathers though it
does not fall

00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:46.190
And the whiteness grows less
vivid on the wall.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:51.556
Again and again in "The Auroras
of Autumn," we have some sort of

00:21:51.556 --> 00:21:55.220
reassuring or splendid or
restful vision,

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.910
and then comes some sort of
threat, "a cold wind."

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.675
In one of the sections the wind
knocks "like a rifle-butt

00:22:02.675 --> 00:22:04.019
against the door."
 

00:22:04.019 --> 00:22:08.576
And this poem was written
during the decade of World War

00:22:08.576 --> 00:22:10.730
Two, so violence,
death,

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:15.817
and the coming of winter are
linked implicitly in the poem

00:22:15.817 --> 00:22:19.410
with the idea of war,
the death of war.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:24.359
And then, we go to a single man
who is always the vehicle of the

00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:27.511
imagination.
In the end, the imagination has

00:22:27.511 --> 00:22:30.819
to reside in the consciousness
of the individual,

00:22:30.819 --> 00:22:34.819
of each one of us,
although from it we can project

00:22:34.819 --> 00:22:38.900
a great cosmic imagination –
an unmoved mover,

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:44.049
a generator of images – as
Stevens does later in the poem.

00:22:44.049 --> 00:22:47.356
So here, we have our hero,
the individual man,

00:22:47.356 --> 00:22:51.201
the man imagining:
The man who is walking

00:22:51.201 --> 00:22:53.420
turns blankly on the sand.
 

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.920
He observes how the north is
always enlarging the change,

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.849
With its frigid brilliances,
its blue-red sweeps

00:23:02.849 --> 00:23:07.730
And gusts of great enkindlings,
its polar green,

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:12.650
The color of ice and fire and
solitude.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:16.476
So here, what happens is very
much like what happens to white

00:23:16.476 --> 00:23:20.111
light when it's put through a
prism and broken up into the

00:23:20.111 --> 00:23:21.769
colors of the rainbow.
 

00:23:21.769 --> 00:23:24.737
This is what happens in the
beginning of "Notes Toward a

00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:27.220
Supreme Fiction" and it's what
happens here.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:32.817
The whiteness of summer breaks
up into the prismatic colors of

00:23:32.817 --> 00:23:35.019
the auroras of autumn.
 

00:23:35.019 --> 00:23:38.440
Now, you probably have never
seen them.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:43.693
I've never seen the auroras of
autumn, but I happen to know a

00:23:43.693 --> 00:23:48.047
man who was at Yale,
living on the old campus in the

00:23:48.047 --> 00:23:52.668
early 1940s, and he told me that
he remembered coming out of

00:23:52.668 --> 00:23:56.349
where he lived at night onto the
old campus,

00:23:56.349 --> 00:23:59.692
and looking up and seeing the
Aurora Borealis,

00:23:59.692 --> 00:24:02.640
in color.
It could happen then.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:08.612
I've seen it in Maine in the
summer sky, but as I've seen it,

00:24:08.612 --> 00:24:11.299
it's been white and dark.
 

00:24:11.299 --> 00:24:15.039
And what you see are white
pulsations in the sky.

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:16.950
They're very beautiful and
they're very wonderful.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:20.184
But it's been many,
many years since I saw any

00:24:20.184 --> 00:24:21.910
colors in the auroras.
 

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:25.707
Nonetheless,
this is what he's writing

00:24:25.707 --> 00:24:30.119
about, the Aurora Borealis in
its colors.

00:24:30.119 --> 00:24:34.195
Section three,
here again, "Farewell to an

00:24:34.195 --> 00:24:36.528
idea..."
Away with the cabin,

00:24:36.528 --> 00:24:39.140
away with the man walking on
the sand.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:46.387
Now, we move to something else,
and what we move to in the next

00:24:46.387 --> 00:24:51.154
few sections are myths,
large-scale myths:

00:24:51.154 --> 00:24:55.867
first the myth of the mother,
the earth mother,

00:24:55.867 --> 00:24:58.549
let's say,
or the sky mother;

00:24:58.549 --> 00:25:02.910
the mother as nurturing,
as warm, as tender;

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:06.804
the mother who could perhaps be
symbolized by summer,

00:25:06.804 --> 00:25:11.372
by a balmy, beneficent summer
day, or by the warmth of the sun

00:25:11.372 --> 00:25:14.901
on a summer day.
Then we get the father,

00:25:14.901 --> 00:25:19.053
the myth of the father,
and this is the kind of,

00:25:19.053 --> 00:25:22.705
well,
let's say the Jove-like or

00:25:22.705 --> 00:25:27.803
Zeus-like being:
the man who presides over the

00:25:27.803 --> 00:25:32.529
heavens.
But first, we have the mother.

00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:36.097
The mother "…gives
transparence to their present

00:25:36.097 --> 00:25:39.038
peace.
/ She makes that gentler that

00:25:39.038 --> 00:25:41.651
can gentle be."
But here again,

00:25:41.651 --> 00:25:44.711
as over and over,
as I said earlier,

00:25:44.711 --> 00:25:48.819
in this poem,
the concept of something warm,

00:25:48.819 --> 00:25:53.526
gentle, and reassuring gives
way to some sort of threat –

00:25:53.526 --> 00:25:57.260
the coming of cold,
the wind, the darkness,

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.293
and finally the wind "like a
rifle-butt" at the end of the

00:26:02.293 --> 00:26:05.365
poem.
Boreal night [I'm toward

00:26:05.365 --> 00:26:09.690
the end of section three here]
Will look like frost as it

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:13.035
approaches them,
And to the mother as she falls

00:26:13.035 --> 00:26:16.010
asleep.
And as they say goodnight,

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.079
goodnight.
Upstairs

00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:21.580
The windows will be lighted,
not the rooms.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.789
What does that mean?
 

00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:26.440
That means that they've turned
off the lights and gone to bed.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.387
Nonetheless,
there are lights appearing in

00:26:29.387 --> 00:26:33.772
the windows, and what can they
be but the lights of the Aurora

00:26:33.772 --> 00:26:37.509
Borealis that shine in the
windows of the house?

00:26:37.509 --> 00:26:40.223
Even though the light doesn't
come from within the house,

00:26:40.223 --> 00:26:41.579
it comes from the heavens.
 

00:26:41.579 --> 00:26:45.329
A wind will spread its
windy grandeurs round

00:26:45.329 --> 00:26:48.930
And knock like a rifle-butt
against the door.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:53.529
The wind will command them with
invincible sound."

00:26:53.529 --> 00:26:58.059
So, this is the temporary,
reassuring togetherness;

00:26:58.059 --> 00:27:01.789
I hate that word but I can't
avoid it really in this section.

00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:05.199
This is where we were all
together with the mother,

00:27:05.199 --> 00:27:07.790
and all was well,
and it was summer.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.130
But it can't last;
it never lasts;

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.749
something more,
something less welcome takes

00:27:13.749 --> 00:27:16.053
its place.
Section four,

00:27:16.053 --> 00:27:21.030
"Farewell to an idea…" Leave
the mother behind;

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.390
we've had her.
Now, we move to the father.

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.496
"The father sits / in space,
wherever he sits,

00:27:28.496 --> 00:27:30.230
of bleak regard."
 

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:34.060
He is not a warm,
nurturing kind of presence.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.920
His regard, his gaze is bleak.
 

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.232
And then we have this curious
image: "as one that is strong in

00:27:41.232 --> 00:27:43.069
the bushes of his eyes."
 

00:27:43.069 --> 00:27:45.450
I think that alludes to the
word "ambush."

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.799
He has a power that is held in
check, as when someone is

00:27:49.799 --> 00:27:53.762
ambushed.
The strength is there and is

00:27:53.762 --> 00:27:58.159
not yet let out.
"He says no to no":

00:27:58.159 --> 00:28:01.210
that's an affirmation.
 

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:05.890
"He says yes to yes":
that's an affirmation.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.490
"He says yes to no":
that is an affirmation.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.880
He always affirms;
he never denies.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.529
And he affirms something new
and then something new and then

00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:20.996
something new,
as signified by "in saying yes

00:28:20.996 --> 00:28:25.300
he says farewell";
that is, when you accept and

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.881
affirm the new idea,
the new imaginative

00:28:28.881 --> 00:28:32.015
construction,
you have said farewell to the

00:28:32.015 --> 00:28:34.887
one that preceded it,
as he has done earlier in the

00:28:34.887 --> 00:28:37.529
poem – farewell to the idea of
the cabin,

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:40.410
farewell to the idea of the
mother.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:45.090
"He leaps from heaven to
heaven, more rapidly / than bad

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:48.920
angels leap from heaven to hell
in flames."

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.426
This is clearly an allusion to
the Christian myth,

00:28:52.426 --> 00:28:56.220
and I'm going to bring up the
Christian myth later,

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.650
toward the end of what I'm
saying about the poem.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:02.213
You perhaps have read,
if you're English majors,

00:29:02.213 --> 00:29:04.450
you may have read Paradise
Lost.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.508
So, you've read about how the
bad angels leap from Heaven to

00:29:08.508 --> 00:29:10.552
Hell.
They're driven out by the

00:29:10.552 --> 00:29:12.240
powers of God and his Son.
 

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:18.311
So, the father leaps;
that is, his imagination,

00:29:18.311 --> 00:29:22.413
the cosmic imagination,
the large scale imagination

00:29:22.413 --> 00:29:26.759
that he personifies,
is hugely vital and capable of

00:29:26.759 --> 00:29:31.188
leaping from one concept to
another, from one heaven to

00:29:31.188 --> 00:29:33.480
another,
and from one myth to another.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.480
 
 

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.957
Now, I meant to say a little
earlier and I will say now,

00:29:40.957 --> 00:29:44.458
that I think,
though I couldn't substantiate

00:29:44.458 --> 00:29:49.297
it from this place alone,
that toward the end of section

00:29:49.297 --> 00:29:52.600
three – the mother as she
falls asleep,

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:57.546
"and as they say good-night,
good-night" – I consider that

00:29:57.546 --> 00:30:01.471
one of a number of allusions in
the poem to the play

00:30:01.471 --> 00:30:07.779
Hamlet.
There's a lot of theater.

00:30:07.779 --> 00:30:11.635
Theater is one of the motifs of
the poem, and I haven't time to

00:30:11.635 --> 00:30:15.180
go into that in detail,
but you see it again and again.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:19.017
And one of the things that
happens in the poem is that a

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:22.855
company of actors comes,
as happens in Hamlet and

00:30:22.855 --> 00:30:24.599
Hamlet welcomes them.
 

00:30:24.599 --> 00:30:27.156
And "Good night,
good night, good night sweet

00:30:27.156 --> 00:30:30.525
ladies, good night sweet ladies,
good night, good night," I

00:30:30.525 --> 00:30:32.210
think it alludes to that.
 

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:36.224
Eliot quotes that;
I think it's in The Waste

00:30:36.224 --> 00:30:37.910
Land that he does it.
 

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:43.970
So the masks--the actors come
in company.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.190
Now, I'm at section four,
toward the end of that section.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.630
"The actors approach in company
in their masks."

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.579
These are not human actors.
 

00:30:51.579 --> 00:30:55.293
This is a superhuman drama that
is being played,

00:30:55.293 --> 00:30:57.980
and the father is inviting
them.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:02.849
And then there's a very
eloquent invocation of the

00:31:02.849 --> 00:31:07.519
father as the master,
the master of the maze.

00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:10.910
Master O master seated by
the fire

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:15.069
And yet in space and motionless
and yet

00:31:15.069 --> 00:31:18.279
Of motion the ever-brightening
origin,

00:31:18.279 --> 00:31:22.110
Profound, and yet the king and
yet the crown,

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.170
Look at this present throne.
 

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:28.799
What company
In masks can choir it with the

00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:32.160
naked wind?
How can we celebrate?

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.622
How can there be a theatrical
celebration of the world when

00:31:36.622 --> 00:31:40.853
the wind is blowing and autumn
is coming and darkness is

00:31:40.853 --> 00:31:44.498
coming?
To call the master the origin

00:31:44.498 --> 00:31:50.480
of motion – motionless and yet
the origin of motion – is to

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:55.498
go back to concepts of God:
the divine as the unmoved

00:31:55.498 --> 00:31:58.814
mover,
a term applied to the Christian

00:31:58.814 --> 00:32:01.650
God and sometimes to other
divinities.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:05.145
So, once again,
we have an allusion to

00:32:05.145 --> 00:32:10.153
religion, which is nonetheless
not part of a religious

00:32:10.153 --> 00:32:14.411
presentation.
In section five,

00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:21.039
the mother and the father give
a party.

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:23.910
I don't happen to like this
section very much.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:28.447
I don't think Stevens really
succeeds in jazzing it up the

00:32:28.447 --> 00:32:31.829
way he tries to.
The children laugh.

00:32:31.829 --> 00:32:36.050
I don't like the negresses who
dance:

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:39.180
…like curious ripenesses
of pattern…

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.210
…[T]he musicians make
insidious tones,

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:43.740
Clawing the sing-song of their
instruments.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.420
The children laugh and jangle a
tinny time.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.553
Well, he's trying very hard to
jazz it up but for me it doesn't

00:32:49.553 --> 00:32:51.779
quite work.
Nonetheless, this is what it is.

00:32:51.779 --> 00:32:55.496
This is the party that the
world stages for us,

00:32:55.496 --> 00:32:58.600
as we look out;
the party of spring or the

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.260
party of the colors of autumn
leaves, and it's a kind of

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.589
symbolic representation of that.
 

00:33:04.589 --> 00:33:09.000
"…he musicians strike the
instinctive poem" and so on.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.349
This then is Chatillon.
 

00:33:11.349 --> 00:33:17.377
You find that's three stanzas,
three tercets from the end of

00:33:17.377 --> 00:33:22.690
that section.
I believe that Chatillon is

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:29.970
used here as the name of a great
chateau in France.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.440
There is such a chateau.
 

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.089
So, it is a palace,
a castle, where there could be

00:33:35.089 --> 00:33:38.589
a splendid party with dancers
and with music.

00:33:38.589 --> 00:33:40.890
"This then is Chatillon or as
you please.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:43.880
/ We stand in the tumult of the
festival."

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.723
The world is a kind of
tumultuous festival at times

00:33:46.723 --> 00:33:48.769
that goes on around us,
let's say,

00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:52.703
on an autumn day when the trees
are very bright in color and the

00:33:52.703 --> 00:33:56.573
wind is blowing and the sky is
blue and the leaves are drifting

00:33:56.573 --> 00:33:59.120
from the trees.
It's the tumult of a festival.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.180
But all of a sudden:
What festival?

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.160
This loud, disordered, mooch?
 

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.710
These brute-like guests?
 

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.639
These musicians dubbing at a
tragedy,

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.599
A-dub, a-dub,
which is made up of this:

00:34:12.599 --> 00:34:15.280
That there are no lines to
speak?

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.139
There is no play.
 

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:23.219
Or, the persons act one merely
by being here.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:26.732
So, once again,
we have affirmation and then

00:34:26.732 --> 00:34:29.510
comes threat,
then comes denial.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.340
There really is no play,
there is no theater.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.210
It's only something that we
imagine.

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:39.350
But then immediately,
as if to prove its validity and

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:42.853
its vitality,
the great imagination speaks in

00:34:42.853 --> 00:34:47.711
section six and utters at the
beginning of that section one of

00:34:47.711 --> 00:34:52.488
the most eloquent tributes to
the beauty of the cosmos that I

00:34:52.488 --> 00:34:57.342
know in poetry,
in which an amazing telescoping

00:34:57.342 --> 00:34:59.390
of time takes place.
 

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:00.090
What do they call it?
 

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:01.889
Fast-forward photography?
 

00:35:01.889 --> 00:35:07.636
Perhaps you've seen one where
the flower grows up and is seen

00:35:07.636 --> 00:35:11.120
blooming.
Here, we see geology in fast

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:15.894
forward, we see mountains rising
and falling like water,

00:35:15.894 --> 00:35:19.054
like waves.
It is a theatre floating

00:35:19.054 --> 00:35:22.273
through the clouds,
Itself a cloud,

00:35:22.273 --> 00:35:28.096
although of misted rock
And mountains running like

00:35:28.096 --> 00:35:33.840
water, wave on wave
Through waves of light.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.660
It is of cloud,
transformed again [a cloud,

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:41.158
transformed again] idly, the way
A season changes color,

00:35:41.158 --> 00:35:44.453
to no end,
Except the lavishing of itself

00:35:44.453 --> 00:35:48.127
in change,
As light changes yellow into

00:35:48.127 --> 00:35:51.478
gold, and gold
To its opal elements,

00:35:51.478 --> 00:35:55.514
and fires delight,
Splashed wide-wise because it

00:35:55.514 --> 00:35:58.815
likes magnificence
And the solemn pleasures of

00:35:58.815 --> 00:36:02.354
magnificent space.
And then human history is seen

00:36:02.354 --> 00:36:05.020
fast forwarding,
as the section goes on:

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.152
A capitol,
It may be, is emerging or has

00:36:08.152 --> 00:36:09.139
just
Collapsed.

00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:13.550
[A civilization has come as a
mountain has come and has

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.477
collapsed.]
The denouement has to be

00:36:16.477 --> 00:36:19.919
postponed…
But now, once again,

00:36:19.919 --> 00:36:23.987
the all-importance of the hero,
the human hero,

00:36:23.987 --> 00:36:27.880
that is, the imagining mind,
is affirmed.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.480
This is nothing until in
a single man contained,

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.750
Nothing until this named thing
nameless is

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.550
And is destroyed.
 

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:41.289
He opens the door of his house
On flames.

00:36:41.289 --> 00:36:43.357
[That's the aurora,
in other words,

00:36:43.357 --> 00:36:45.000
the Aurora Borealis.]
The

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.905
scholar of one candle sees
An Arctic effulgence flaring on

00:36:49.905 --> 00:36:52.770
the frame
Of everything he is.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:57.440
And he feels afraid.
In section seven,

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:03.002
Stevens visualizes autumn as,
let's say, a mythical

00:37:03.002 --> 00:37:06.957
hypothesis.
Suppose that there is a cosmic

00:37:06.957 --> 00:37:11.753
imagination that imagines the
whole show, an imagination that

00:37:11.753 --> 00:37:14.869
imagines the passing of the
seasons,

00:37:14.869 --> 00:37:18.081
that imagines the earth,
the solar system,

00:37:18.081 --> 00:37:19.570
the whole cosmos.
 

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.870
Suppose that maybe there is.
 

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:23.769
Let's imagine that there is.
 

00:37:23.769 --> 00:37:26.360
So, the answer to the questions
are always "yes."

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.599
Is there an imagination
that sits enthroned

00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:32.210
As grim as it is benevolent,
the just

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:35.641
And the unjust,
which in the midst of summer

00:37:35.641 --> 00:37:37.929
stops
To imagine winter?

00:37:37.929 --> 00:37:39.760
[Yes there is,
why not?]

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.795
When the leaves are dead,
Does it take its place in the

00:37:43.795 --> 00:37:46.329
north and unfold itself,
Goat-leaper,

00:37:46.329 --> 00:37:48.830
crystalled and luminous,
sitting

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:53.324
In highest night?
Here – and I have no time to

00:37:53.324 --> 00:37:57.826
go into this aspect of the poem,
which is another one like the

00:37:57.826 --> 00:38:01.516
theater and then the
Hamlet allusions that I

00:38:01.516 --> 00:38:06.019
think are there – this is part
of the astronomical motifs in

00:38:06.019 --> 00:38:08.375
the poem.
There's a great deal about the

00:38:08.375 --> 00:38:11.099
stars.
I mentioned Draco in the first

00:38:11.099 --> 00:38:15.590
section as possibly underlying
the celestial serpents,

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:19.614
a great big constellation that
is across the sky for us,

00:38:19.614 --> 00:38:21.369
for us in New England.
 

00:38:21.369 --> 00:38:26.630
And here the goat-leaper is the
constellation Capricorn.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:30.519
Capricorn means "goat horn," as
you know.

00:38:30.519 --> 00:38:35.755
And you may also know that
Capricorn begins in the zodiac

00:38:35.755 --> 00:38:40.243
on the twenty-second of
December, which is to say

00:38:40.243 --> 00:38:44.170
immediately after the winter
solstice.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:49.471
So, the constellation Capricorn
takes over, comes in,

00:38:49.471 --> 00:38:55.180
at what Stevens at the end of
the poem calls "in winter's

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.328
nick,"
in the nick of winter just as

00:38:58.328 --> 00:39:02.511
the solstice comes and the
constellation Capricorn becomes

00:39:02.511 --> 00:39:05.740
the dominant constellation of
the zodiac.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.090
 
 

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:14.400
But now we can't stay solemn,
the mood has to change.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.832
And so we get,
at the end of this section,

00:39:17.832 --> 00:39:21.515
a change from destiny to slight
caprice with,

00:39:21.515 --> 00:39:25.449
I think, an allusion to the
word Capricorn.

00:39:25.449 --> 00:39:30.294
And you may know that the
capri element has to do

00:39:30.294 --> 00:39:33.993
with leaping,
so the leaping from Heaven to

00:39:33.993 --> 00:39:36.900
Hell is associated with that.
 

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.550
It must change from
destiny to slight caprice.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:43.750
And thus its jetted tragedy,
its stele

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:47.039
And shape and mournful making
move to find

00:39:47.039 --> 00:39:50.460
What must unmake it and,
at last, what can

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:54.170
Say, a flippant communication
under the moon.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.722
So, all this is thrown away and
what we have is "a flippant

00:39:56.722 --> 00:39:58.349
communication," something
flippant.

00:39:58.349 --> 00:40:03.848
But that is the way Stevens's
imagination works on a large

00:40:03.848 --> 00:40:07.853
scale.
"The Auroras of Autumn" is not

00:40:07.853 --> 00:40:14.645
architectonically structured as,
say, something like the odes of

00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:19.655
Keats and Shelley are,
like "Adonais" or "The Ode on

00:40:19.655 --> 00:40:23.090
Melancholy" or "The Ode on a
Grecian Urn."

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:26.674
That is to say,
it does not move by logical

00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:31.880
stages to a climax at the end
that incorporates and is founded

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.269
on what has gone before.
 

00:40:34.269 --> 00:40:37.010
Rather, it is structured,
if structure is the word,

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:38.489
as I've been telling you.
 

00:40:38.489 --> 00:40:40.380
You go from one thing to
another.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.559
You go from one thing to its
opposite.

00:40:42.559 --> 00:40:45.170
You go from something solemn to
something flippant.

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:46.920
You go from summer to autumn.
 

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:51.345
You go from day to night,
from the warmth of the mother

00:40:51.345 --> 00:40:54.460
to the threat of death and
darkness.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.775
Nonetheless,
it does move--the poem does

00:40:57.775 --> 00:41:01.769
move, toward what I would call a
culmination;

00:41:01.769 --> 00:41:04.972
not an architectonic or
structural climax,

00:41:04.972 --> 00:41:07.550
but a kind of emotional climax.
 

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:11.094
And this happens in the next to
last section,

00:41:11.094 --> 00:41:14.236
section nine,
and it's predicated on the

00:41:14.236 --> 00:41:19.150
assertion of innocence at the
beginning of section eight.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:23.125
And I should say,
in case I don't have time to do

00:41:23.125 --> 00:41:27.597
justice to it at the end,
that in section ten the whole

00:41:27.597 --> 00:41:29.420
thing falls apart.
 

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:34.560
We discard the whole thing,
and it all becomes fragmentary,

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:39.346
and the mythical creations
become trivial and we get an

00:41:39.346 --> 00:41:44.132
ending that is completely
unsatisfactory to those of us

00:41:44.132 --> 00:41:48.099
who love resonant,
rhetorical endings.

00:41:48.099 --> 00:41:52.479
It's just not like that and we
can't look in Stevens for that

00:41:52.479 --> 00:41:56.004
kind of ending.
The term "innocence" is another

00:41:56.004 --> 00:42:00.205
term, like "imagination," that
has to be thought of in its

00:42:00.205 --> 00:42:01.680
Stevensian sense.
 

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:07.440
 
 

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.028
The opposite of innocence,
for Stevens,

00:42:12.028 --> 00:42:15.409
is either guilt or malice.
 

00:42:15.409 --> 00:42:18.059
Now, you probably know,
you may know,

00:42:18.059 --> 00:42:21.150
that the origin of the word
"innocence,"

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:26.019
the root, Latin root of the
word "innocence" is a Latin verb

00:42:26.019 --> 00:42:28.659
meaning to harm:
noceo.

00:42:28.659 --> 00:42:33.409
So, "innocence," literally is
"unharmingness."

00:42:33.409 --> 00:42:39.312
The affirmation of innocence
that comes to the speaker in

00:42:39.312 --> 00:42:44.583
section eight arises,
in a sense, from all that has

00:42:44.583 --> 00:42:48.107
gone before;
that is, from the myth-making

00:42:48.107 --> 00:42:51.719
of the early sections because,
as we think back on them,

00:42:51.719 --> 00:42:55.420
it's obvious that Stevens's
overarching myths,

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.710
his great cosmic myths – the
mother,

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:02.771
the father, the celestial
imagination that imagines the

00:43:02.771 --> 00:43:07.360
whole world and the passage of
the zodiac – none of that has

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.648
anything to do with revealed
religion or particularly with

00:43:11.648 --> 00:43:16.539
the Christianity that we,
most of us, know so much about.

00:43:16.539 --> 00:43:20.066
As we think back,
it's obvious that there's

00:43:20.066 --> 00:43:23.510
nothing in them about a
benevolent God,

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:28.067
a God who watches over us,
a God who comforts us and who

00:43:28.067 --> 00:43:31.050
will reward us if we are
virtuous.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.619
There's nothing about that.
 

00:43:32.619 --> 00:43:35.674
The Imagination,
with a capital I,

00:43:35.674 --> 00:43:39.949
the cosmic Imagination is as
grim as it is benevolent.

00:43:39.949 --> 00:43:43.590
The world is as grim as it is
benevolent.

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:47.556
We have the benevolence of
summer but, always after it,

00:43:47.556 --> 00:43:52.110
the darkening of autumn and the
grimness and cold of winter.

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:55.614
And humanly,
we have the change from youth

00:43:55.614 --> 00:44:00.230
to the midst of life to finally
the coming of death.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:03.547
And that possibility,
that inevitability,

00:44:03.547 --> 00:44:06.449
is faced, at the end of the
poem.

00:44:06.449 --> 00:44:10.860
So, what is innocent here is
the world.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.020
The world is innocent.
 

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.670
It means us no harm;
it is not malicious.

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:21.216
If there's no God who
benevolently watches over us,

00:44:21.216 --> 00:44:26.126
there's also no God who judges
us or who consigns us to

00:44:26.126 --> 00:44:30.150
damnation.
So, we can live in the world in

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:35.474
this state of innocence without
what Stevens eloquently calls

00:44:35.474 --> 00:44:40.709
– and I hope you'll check it
out again after this – "the

00:44:40.709 --> 00:44:44.880
enigma of the guilty dream":
Christianity.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.230
We don't understand it.
 

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.935
It's a riddle;
it's the guilty dream,

00:44:48.935 --> 00:44:52.489
but it's a dream like all other
dreams.

00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:56.022
The world operates
impersonally,

00:44:56.022 --> 00:44:58.530
it means us no harm.
 

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:04.840
 
 

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.789
Now, I'm going to read toward
the end of section eight:

00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:12.407
So, then,
these lights [these lights are

00:45:12.407 --> 00:45:15.059
the Aurora Borealis,
which he's

00:45:15.059 --> 00:45:18.972
referred to by the phrase
"these lights" several times in

00:45:18.972 --> 00:45:20.300
the poem]
are not

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:24.666
a spell of light,
A saying out of a cloud,

00:45:24.666 --> 00:45:29.229
but innocence.
An innocence of the earth and

00:45:29.229 --> 00:45:32.690
no false sign
Or symbol of malice.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:37.525
That we partake thereof,
Lie down like children in this

00:45:37.525 --> 00:45:39.248
holiness,
As if, awake,

00:45:39.248 --> 00:45:42.110
we lay in the quiet of
sleep…

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:45.749
I haven't time to go on,
but in section nine,

00:45:45.749 --> 00:45:50.216
Stevens picks up on this and
says: "We were as Danes in

00:45:50.216 --> 00:45:54.600
Denmark all day long /
…hale-hearted landsmen";

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.820
we were brothers.
 

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:58.500
And here, we have the play
Hamlet again.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.188
As you remember in
Hamlet,

00:46:00.188 --> 00:46:02.880
there's something rotten in the
state of Denmark.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.270
And here the world is Denmark
and there's something wholesome

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:07.739
in the state of Denmark.
 

00:46:07.739 --> 00:46:13.084
And what is wholesome is us and
the world and the beauty of the

00:46:13.084 --> 00:46:18.429
world, even though that beauty
eventually gives way to darkness

00:46:18.429 --> 00:46:21.536
and cold.
"Shall we be found hanging in

00:46:21.536 --> 00:46:23.179
the trees next spring?"
 

00:46:23.179 --> 00:46:25.559
This is toward the end of
section nine.

00:46:25.559 --> 00:46:30.233
People interpret this
differently, and I think the

00:46:30.233 --> 00:46:34.709
word "hanging" is misleading,
but I read it as meaning:

00:46:34.709 --> 00:46:38.173
are we going to come back in
the spring as the leaves come

00:46:38.173 --> 00:46:39.510
back in the spring?
 

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:42.615
And we're not.
Human life is a single

00:46:42.615 --> 00:46:46.578
trajectory and has a single
spring, summer,

00:46:46.578 --> 00:46:51.579
and winter, and loss in such a
world is permanent.

00:46:51.579 --> 00:46:55.354
But in this world we have the
splendor of the world,

00:46:55.354 --> 00:46:59.203
if we can simply see it,
if we can allow ourselves to

00:46:59.203 --> 00:47:01.719
see it without preconceptions.
 

00:47:01.719 --> 00:47:05.443
We can see "the stars…
putting on their glittering

00:47:05.443 --> 00:47:07.690
belts."
This reminds me of the

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:11.956
constellation Orion which has a
glittering belt and a dagger

00:47:11.956 --> 00:47:14.906
hanging from it.
"They throw around their

00:47:14.906 --> 00:47:18.517
shoulders cloaks that flash /
like a great shadow's last

00:47:18.517 --> 00:47:21.412
embellishment."
But now suddenly there's a

00:47:21.412 --> 00:47:23.704
change;
there's a drop in the rhetoric

00:47:23.704 --> 00:47:25.940
to the utmost simplicity of
language.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:29.718
The last tercet,
three-line stanza,

00:47:29.718 --> 00:47:34.609
of section nine:
"It may come tomorrow in the

00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:39.205
simplest word,
/ almost as part of innocence,

00:47:39.205 --> 00:47:44.050
almost, / almost as the
tenderest and the truest part."

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:47.690
"It," I am quite certain,
is death.

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:54.245
And Hamlet speaks memorable and
extremely simple words when he

00:47:54.245 --> 00:47:58.159
is about to die.
He's about to fight a duel in

00:47:58.159 --> 00:48:01.163
which he's going to be poisoned,
and Horatio,

00:48:01.163 --> 00:48:04.440
his friend, is concerned and
fears his death.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.400
And Hamlet says,
"Tush, it's nothing.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.903
If it be not today,
it will be tomorrow,

00:48:11.903 --> 00:48:15.676
and if it be not tomorrow it
will be today,

00:48:15.676 --> 00:48:19.269
and if it be not now,
it will come."

00:48:19.269 --> 00:48:21.849
And that, I think,
is what is being echoed,

00:48:21.849 --> 00:48:24.613
in a sense, here:
"It may come tomorrow in the

00:48:24.613 --> 00:48:28.041
simplest word."
Death is almost as a part of

00:48:28.041 --> 00:48:32.239
innocence, almost as the
tenderest and truest part.

00:48:32.239 --> 00:48:35.980
Well, I can say only a few
words about section ten.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.039
As I say, everything goes to
hell in section ten.

00:48:39.039 --> 00:48:41.699
All the great concepts are
discarded.

00:48:41.699 --> 00:48:46.450
But in section ten,
we do return to the concept of

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:48.679
happiness in Stevens.
 

00:48:48.679 --> 00:48:54.388
We are, humanity is,
an unhappy people in a happy

00:48:54.388 --> 00:48:56.726
world;
that is to say,

00:48:56.726 --> 00:49:01.994
we live in a world in which
there is splendor and vitality

00:49:01.994 --> 00:49:07.171
and the sun is like a jungle
tuft of feathers and like an

00:49:07.171 --> 00:49:10.727
animal eye,
but we're unhappy because we

00:49:10.727 --> 00:49:15.326
lack the faculty of imagination,
as the "you" does in the short

00:49:15.326 --> 00:49:17.709
poem.
The cosmic imagination

00:49:17.709 --> 00:49:21.777
meditates the whole thing,
the history of humanity,

00:49:21.777 --> 00:49:23.730
and all of our fates.
 

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:29.212
At the very end of the poem the
mother reappears in degraded

00:49:29.212 --> 00:49:33.453
form as a "harridan,"
which means kind of an ugly,

00:49:33.453 --> 00:49:36.758
untidy old crone,
and "a haggling of wind and

00:49:36.758 --> 00:49:39.356
weather."
The splendors of the aurora

00:49:39.356 --> 00:49:41.619
have come to that,
"by theses lights,

00:49:41.619 --> 00:49:44.949
/ like a blaze of summer straw,
in winter's nick."

00:49:44.949 --> 00:49:49.680
That's the last metaphor for
the Aurora Borealis.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.883
"Winter's nick" is the solstice;
the coming of Capricorn,

00:49:53.883 --> 00:49:57.134
the constellation,
and the auroras are like "a

00:49:57.134 --> 00:50:00.530
blaze of… straw" in the midst
of all that.

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:05.650
Not a very grand image,
but for Stevens this is what we

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.210
have, and this is enough.
 

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:12.372
And I think in a poem like "The
Auroras of Autumn," he manages

00:50:12.372 --> 00:50:14.828
to convince us,
at least temporarily,

00:50:14.828 --> 00:50:16.330
that it is enough.
 

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:22.000
Thank you.

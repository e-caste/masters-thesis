00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.446
Professor Paul Bloom:
On Monday we--I presented an

00:00:16.446 --> 00:00:20.077
introduction to evolutionary
psychology, the looking at

00:00:20.077 --> 00:00:24.247
psychology from an evolutionary
perspective, and trying to make

00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:28.416
a case and give some examples of
how it can help illuminate and

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:32.250
illustrate certain aspects of
how the mind works.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.686
One of the advantages of an
evolutionary perspective on the

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:43.122
mind is that it forces us to
look scientifically at what we

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:46.590
would otherwise take for
granted.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.368
There are a lot of aspects of
how we are and what we are and

00:00:50.368 --> 00:00:52.930
what we do that seem so natural
to us.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.809
They come so instinctively and
easily it's difficult,

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.300
and sort of unnatural,
to step back and explore them

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.701
scientifically but if we're
going to be scientists and look

00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:07.043
at the mind from a scientific
perspective we have to get a

00:01:07.043 --> 00:01:10.502
sort of distance from ourselves
and ask questions that other

00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:13.200
people would not normally think
to ask.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.230
And the clearest case of this
arises with the emotions.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.053
And as a starting point there's
a lovely quote from the

00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:27.018
psychologist and philosopher
William James that I want to

00:01:27.018 --> 00:01:29.129
begin with.
So, he writes: 

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:33.010
To the psychologist alone
can such questions occur as:

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.970
Why do we smile when pleased
and not scowl?

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.571
Why are we unable to talk to a
crowd as we talk to a single

00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:42.023
friend?
Why does a particular maiden

00:01:42.023 --> 00:01:45.609
turn our wits upside down?
The common man--[None of you

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.624
are the common man.]
The common man can only say,

00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:51.306
"Of course we smile.
Of course our heart palpitates

00:01:51.306 --> 00:01:54.989
at the sight of the crowd.
Of course we love the maiden.

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:57.520
And so probably does each
animal feel about the particular

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.140
things it tends to do in the
presence of certain objects.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.460
To the lion it is the lioness
which is made to be loved;

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.397
to the bear the she-bear.
To the broody hen,

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:09.833
the notion would probably seem
monstrous that there should be a

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:13.269
creature in the world to whom a
nestful of eggs was not utterly

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.428
fascinating and precious and
never to be too-much-sat-upon

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:20.301
object which it is to her.
Now, there's a few things to

00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:23.419
note about this passage.
First, it's incredibly sexist.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.680
It assumes not just merely in
reflexive use of phrases.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.772
It assumes that--William James
assumes he's talking to males,

00:02:30.772 --> 00:02:35.069
male humans who sometimes take
the perspective of male bears.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.069
And so, it assumes a male
audience.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.404
You wouldn't normally--You
wouldn't actually ever write

00:02:41.404 --> 00:02:43.320
this way.
A second point is it's

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.381
beautifully written and you're
not--;also, not allowed to write

00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:51.073
that way anymore either.
It's poetic and lyrical and

00:02:51.073 --> 00:02:54.421
if--William James
characteristically writes that

00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:57.021
way.
I think he writes so much

00:02:57.021 --> 00:03:00.046
better than his brother,
Henry James,

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.696
an obscure novelist.
[laughter]

00:03:02.696 --> 00:03:05.779
Finally though,
the point that he makes is a

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:07.930
terrific one,
which is yes,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.417
all of these things seem
natural to us but the reason why

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:17.546
they seem natural is not because
they are in some sense necessary

00:03:17.546 --> 00:03:21.525
or logical truths.
Rather, they emerge from

00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:25.680
contingent aspects of our
biological nature.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.273
And so we need to step back.
We actually--We need to step

00:03:29.273 --> 00:03:33.173
back and ask questions like--and
these are questions we're going

00:03:33.173 --> 00:03:37.366
to ask--Why does poop smell bad?
Avoid the temptation to say,

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:40.840
"Well, poop smells bad because
it's so stinky."

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.152
The stinkiness of poop is not
an irreducible fact about the

00:03:45.152 --> 00:03:47.948
universe.
Rather, the stinkiness of poop

00:03:47.948 --> 00:03:50.190
is a fact about human
psychology.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.850
To a dung beetle poop smells
just fine.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.548
Why does chocolate taste good?
Well, chocolate--The good

00:03:56.548 --> 00:04:00.626
tastiness of chocolate isn't
some necessary fact about the

00:04:00.626 --> 00:04:03.017
world.
It's a fact about our minds

00:04:03.017 --> 00:04:06.189
that doesn't hold true for many
other creatures.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.914
And so, we have to step back
and ask why to us do we find

00:04:10.914 --> 00:04:14.350
chocolate appealing?
Why do we love our children?

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.364
Don't say they're lovable.
Many of them are not [laughter]

00:04:19.364 --> 00:04:23.243
and, as William James points
out, every animal,

00:04:23.243 --> 00:04:26.279
most animals,
many animals love their

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:28.423
children.
They think their children are

00:04:28.423 --> 00:04:31.149
precious and wonderful.
Why?

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:33.560
Why do we get angry when people
hit us?

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.290
Suppose somebody walked up to
you and slapped you in the face?

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.610
You'd be afraid.
You'd be angry.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.884
Would you get sleepy,
feel nostalgic,

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:50.200
suddenly desire some cold soup?
[laughter] No.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.427
Those are stupid alternatives.
Of course if somebody slapped

00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:56.200
us you would--we would get angry
or afraid.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.451
Why?
Why do we feel good when

00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:06.560
someone does us a favor?
Why don't we feel angry?

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.275
Why don't we feel fearful?
What we're going to do

00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:13.230
throughout this course is step
back and ask these questions.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.678
We're going to ask questions
nobody would have otherwise

00:05:16.678 --> 00:05:19.437
thought to ask,
where the common man wouldn't

00:05:19.437 --> 00:05:20.932
address,
and this is,

00:05:20.932 --> 00:05:23.220
of course, standard in all
sciences.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.329
The first step to insight is to
ask questions like why do things

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:33.055
fall down and not up?
And I imagine the first person

00:05:33.055 --> 00:05:35.796
who articulated the question
aloud probably met with the

00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:37.990
response saying,
"What a stupid question.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.259
Of course things fall down."
Well, yes, of course things

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.050
fall down, but why?
Why is our flesh warm?

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.459
Why does water turn solid when
it gets cold?

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:50.872
These are natural facts about
the universe,

00:05:50.872 --> 00:05:54.030
but the naturalness needs to be
explained and not merely

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.463
assumed.
In this class we're going to

00:05:56.463 --> 00:06:00.138
explore, throughout the course,
what seems natural to us and

00:06:00.138 --> 00:06:04.003
try to make sense of it.
And to that end we have to ask

00:06:04.003 --> 00:06:07.060
questions that you wouldn't
normally ask.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.792
We've already done this to some
extent with domains such as

00:06:10.792 --> 00:06:13.797
visual perception,
memory, language and

00:06:13.797 --> 00:06:19.121
rationality, but now we're going
to move to the case where it's

00:06:19.121 --> 00:06:23.329
maybe even somewhat more
difficult to do this.

00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:26.399
Now, we're going to start
dealing with the emotions.

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:29.843
We're going to talk about the
emotions, why they exist,

00:06:29.843 --> 00:06:32.649
what they're there for,
and how they work.

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:36.649
I want to start off with the
wrong theory of the emotions.

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:40.089
And the wrong theory of the
emotions is beautifully

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:43.735
illustrated in the television
and movie series Star

00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:47.018
Trek.
In this alternative fantasy

00:06:47.018 --> 00:06:49.760
world, there are characters,
Mr.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.802
Spock in the original Star
Trek, Data in one of the

00:06:54.802 --> 00:06:58.959
spin-offs, who are described as
competent,

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:03.230
capable, in fact in many ways,
super competent and super

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.702
capable people.
But they're described as not

00:07:06.702 --> 00:07:09.348
having emotions.
Spock is described as not

00:07:09.348 --> 00:07:12.561
having emotions because he's
half Vulcan, from a planet where

00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:16.036
they lack emotions.
Data is an android who is said

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:19.184
to lack an emotion chip.
This lack of emotions on

00:07:19.184 --> 00:07:21.550
this--on a TV series does not
hurt them much.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.215
They're able to fully function.
And in fact,

00:07:24.215 --> 00:07:28.460
in a TV series emotions are
often seen as a detriment.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.207
You do better off without them.
And there are many people in

00:07:32.207 --> 00:07:35.921
sort of common sense who might
think "Gee, if only I could just

00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:39.387
use my rationality,
think reasonably and rationally

00:07:39.387 --> 00:07:43.475
and not let my emotions guide my
behavior I'd be much better

00:07:43.475 --> 00:07:46.204
off."
It turns out that this is a

00:07:46.204 --> 00:07:51.360
notion of how to think about the
emotions that is deeply wrong.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.370
And in fact,
makes no sense at all.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.473
Using the example of Star
Trek, Steven Pinker,

00:07:58.473 --> 00:08:01.816
in his book How the Mind
Works, nicely illustrates

00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:05.724
the problem here.
He writes, "Spock must have

00:08:05.724 --> 00:08:09.459
been driven by some motives or
goals.

00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:12.968
Something must have led him to
explore strange new worlds,

00:08:12.968 --> 00:08:16.537
to seek out new civilizations
and to boldly go where no man

00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:19.462
had gone before."
Presumably, it was intellectual

00:08:19.462 --> 00:08:22.199
curiosity that set him to drive
and solve problems.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:27.980
It was solidarity with his
allies that led him to be such a

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.554
competent and brave officer.
What would he have done if

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.419
attacked by a predator or an
invading Klingon?

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.097
Did he do a handstand,
solve the four-color map

00:08:38.097 --> 00:08:40.908
theorem?
Presumably, a part of his brain

00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:45.437
quickly mobilized his faculties
to scope out how to flee and how

00:08:45.437 --> 00:08:49.247
to take steps to avoid a
vulnerable predicament in the

00:08:49.247 --> 00:08:52.289
future.
That is, he had fear.

00:08:52.289 --> 00:08:56.530
Spock did not walk around naked
around the ship.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.419
Presumably, he felt modesty.
He got out of bed.

00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:02.720
Presumably, he had some
ambitions and drive.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.833
He engaged in conversations.
Presumably, he had some

00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:08.789
sociable interests.
Without emotions to drive us we

00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:12.630
would do nothing at all.
And you could illustrate this

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.488
scientifically.
Creatures like Spock and Data

00:09:16.488 --> 00:09:21.308
don't exist in the real world
but there are unusual and

00:09:21.308 --> 00:09:24.789
unfortunate cases where people
lose,

00:09:24.789 --> 00:09:27.710
to some extent or another,
their emotions.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.406
And you could look at these
people and see what happens to

00:09:31.406 --> 00:09:33.231
them.
The classic case,

00:09:33.231 --> 00:09:37.424
the most famous case,
is that of a man called Phineas

00:09:37.424 --> 00:09:40.187
Gage.
Phineas Gage is the classic

00:09:40.187 --> 00:09:43.715
Intro Psych example – an
extremely poor guy,

00:09:43.715 --> 00:09:47.262
poor schmuck.
In 1848--He was a construction

00:09:47.262 --> 00:09:50.945
foreman.
In 1848 he was working at a

00:09:50.945 --> 00:09:54.940
site with explosives and iron
rods.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:00.222
And due to an explosion,
an iron rod passed through his

00:10:00.222 --> 00:10:03.241
head like so.
Imagine that rod shooting

00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:05.984
upwards.
It went under his eye and

00:10:05.984 --> 00:10:10.737
popped out the top of his head.
It landed about one hundred

00:10:10.737 --> 00:10:13.710
feet away covered with blood and
brains.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.550
The rod itself weighed thirteen
pounds.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:23.401
Amazingly, Gage was not killed.
In fact, he was knocked

00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:27.123
unconscious only for a short
period and then he got up and

00:10:27.123 --> 00:10:30.779
his friends surrounded him and
asked, "Are you okay?"

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:33.820
And they--And then they took
him to the hospital.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.354
On the way to the hospital,
they stopped by a tavern and he

00:10:37.354 --> 00:10:40.889
had a little pint of cider to
drink, sat down and talked to

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:43.839
people.
And then he had an infection,

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:47.676
had to have surgery.
But when it was all said and

00:10:47.676 --> 00:10:50.487
done he wasn't blind,
he wasn't deaf,

00:10:50.487 --> 00:10:53.845
didn't lose language,
didn't become aphasic,

00:10:53.845 --> 00:10:56.500
no paralysis,
no retardation.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.940
In some sense,
what happened was much worse.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:06.562
He lost his character.
Here's a description at the

00:11:06.562 --> 00:11:10.932
time of what Gage was like.
And this is from Damasio's

00:11:10.932 --> 00:11:14.470
excellent book Descartes'
Error:

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.813
He used to be a really
responsible guy,

00:11:17.813 --> 00:11:19.864
a family man,
very reliable,

00:11:19.864 --> 00:11:23.709
very trustworthy.
But after the accident he was

00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:27.123
fitful, irreverent,
indulging at times in the

00:11:27.123 --> 00:11:30.552
grossest profanity,
manifesting but little

00:11:30.552 --> 00:11:34.546
deference for his fellows,
impatient of restraint or

00:11:34.546 --> 00:11:37.415
advice,
a child in his intellectual

00:11:37.415 --> 00:11:41.971
capacities and manifestations.
He had the animal pleasures of

00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:45.446
a strong man.
His foul language is so debased

00:11:45.446 --> 00:11:50.460
that women are advised not to
stay long in his presence.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:55.042
And he couldn't hold a job.
He lost his family,

00:11:55.042 --> 00:11:58.370
couldn't hold a job.
He ended up in the circus.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.824
He was in the circus going
around the country with his big

00:12:01.824 --> 00:12:05.582
iron rod telling everybody the
story as they surrounded him and

00:12:05.582 --> 00:12:08.743
clapped.
There are other cases like

00:12:08.743 --> 00:12:12.487
Phineas Gage,
cases where people have had

00:12:12.487 --> 00:12:17.916
damage to that same part of the
brain, parts of the frontal

00:12:17.916 --> 00:12:22.094
cortex.
And what they've lost is they

00:12:22.094 --> 00:12:26.940
basically lost a good part of
their emotions.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.242
And what this means is they
don't really care that much

00:12:30.242 --> 00:12:33.139
about things.
They can't prioritize.

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:37.781
Damasio tells a case of one of
his patients who was under the

00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:42.662
pseudonym here of Elliot.
And Elliot had a tumor in his

00:12:42.662 --> 00:12:45.769
frontal lobe.
And the tumor had to be removed

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:48.549
and with it came a lot of
Elliot's frontal lobe.

00:12:48.549 --> 00:12:52.568
And again, as a result of this,
Elliot was not struck blind or

00:12:52.568 --> 00:12:56.014
deaf or retarded,
and he didn't become the sort

00:12:56.014 --> 00:12:59.570
of profane character that
Phineas Gage became,

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.019
but he lost the ability to
prioritize.

00:13:04.019 --> 00:13:05.470
He lost the ability to set
goals.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.100
Damasio describes him here: 

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.264
At his job at an activity
he would read and fully

00:13:14.264 --> 00:13:18.200
understand the significance of
the material [He works in an

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.507
office.]
but the problem was he was

00:13:20.507 --> 00:13:22.192
likely,
all of a sudden,

00:13:22.192 --> 00:13:25.002
to turn from the task he had
initiated to doing something

00:13:25.002 --> 00:13:27.309
else and spending an entire day
doing that.

00:13:27.309 --> 00:13:30.764
He might spend an entire
afternoon deliberating on which

00:13:30.764 --> 00:13:34.220
principle of categorization he
should apply to files.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.847
Should it be the date or the
size of the document,

00:13:36.847 --> 00:13:39.100
pertinence to the case or
another?

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.796
He couldn't set his goals.
He couldn't--He ended up not

00:13:42.796 --> 00:13:45.575
being able to keep a job,
not being able to deal with

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:48.468
people.
And these are not men who have

00:13:48.468 --> 00:13:51.798
lost their emotions.
There is no case around where

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:54.750
you could have your emotions
entirely blotted out.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:59.215
But they lost a large part of
their emotional capacity and as

00:13:59.215 --> 00:14:01.970
a result, their rationality
failed.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.639
Emotions set goals and
establish priorities.

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:10.040
And without them you wouldn't
do anything, you couldn't do

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.873
anything.
Your desire to come to class to

00:14:12.873 --> 00:14:15.879
study, to go out with friends,
to read a book,

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:20.604
to raise a family,
to be--to do anything are

00:14:20.604 --> 00:14:26.184
priorities set by your emotions.
Life would be impossible

00:14:26.184 --> 00:14:30.196
without those emotions.
And so, there's certain themes

00:14:30.196 --> 00:14:33.346
we're going to explore here.
The first is this,

00:14:33.346 --> 00:14:36.632
that emotions are basically
mechanisms that set goals and

00:14:36.632 --> 00:14:40.153
priorities and we're going to
talk a lot about--in this class

00:14:40.153 --> 00:14:42.559
and the next class about
universals.

00:14:42.559 --> 00:14:46.070
We're also going to talk about
culture.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.238
It turns out that cultures,
different cultures,

00:14:49.238 --> 00:14:52.957
including differences between
America and Japan and the

00:14:52.957 --> 00:14:55.850
American South and the American
North,

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.964
have somewhat different
emotional triggers and emotional

00:14:59.964 --> 00:15:03.484
baselines to respond to.
But at the same time,

00:15:03.484 --> 00:15:07.157
as Darwin well knew,
emotions have universal roots

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:11.730
that are shared across all
humans and across many animals.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.852
So, the agenda for this class
and the next class is going to

00:15:15.852 --> 00:15:18.554
go like this.
First, I want to talk a little

00:15:18.554 --> 00:15:21.587
bit about facial expressions,
which are ways in which we

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:24.289
communicate our emotions – not
the only way,

00:15:24.289 --> 00:15:27.006
but an important way – and
look, in particular,

00:15:27.006 --> 00:15:30.289
at the case of smiling because
it's kind of interesting.

00:15:30.289 --> 00:15:34.346
Then I want to look at one case
study of a nonsocial emotion,

00:15:34.346 --> 00:15:37.017
that of fear.
I want to then deal with

00:15:37.017 --> 00:15:40.402
feelings towards our kin,
people we're genetically

00:15:40.402 --> 00:15:43.005
related to,
and then--and this will take us

00:15:43.005 --> 00:15:45.380
to the next class,
feelings towards non kin.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:50.202
So first, faces.
And as an introduction to faces

00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:54.397
I have a brief film clip from
Paul Ekman, who is one of the

00:15:54.397 --> 00:15:58.809
world's great scholars in the
study of facial expressions.

00:15:58.809 --> 00:16:01.634
In Ekman's work,
he presents us with

00:16:01.634 --> 00:16:06.072
instructions on how to make
different faces and identify

00:16:06.072 --> 00:16:08.313
faces.
Ekman actually has a sort of

00:16:08.313 --> 00:16:11.179
more practical career along with
his scientific career.

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:15.703
He trains police and secret
service members to try to figure

00:16:15.703 --> 00:16:18.539
out cues to honesty and
dishonesty.

00:16:18.539 --> 00:16:21.072
There's a very interesting
New Yorker profile on him

00:16:21.072 --> 00:16:23.604
by Malcolm Gladwell a few years
ago, something you might be

00:16:23.604 --> 00:16:26.340
interested in.
But let's do one of his faces.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.510
Please lower your brows and
draw them together.

00:16:38.879 --> 00:16:40.865
That means even those who
aren't making eye contact with

00:16:40.865 --> 00:16:41.190
me now.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.029
Tense your lower and upper
eyelids.

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:50.060
Don't pop out contact lenses
but just tense them.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.860
Stare.
Your eyes can bulge somewhat.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.669
[laughter] Okay.
Now, the last part is important.

00:16:59.669 --> 00:17:02.700
Press your lips together with
the corners straight or down.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.330
That's good.
You got it.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.894
[laughter] Okay.
Just because you are not making

00:17:09.894 --> 00:17:11.950
eye contact with me doesn't mean
I can't see you.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:20.250
Okay. .
And what face is that?

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.220
What emotion does that
correspond to?

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:28.123
Anger.
There's all sorts of databases

00:17:28.123 --> 00:17:33.394
of different faces from around.
This guy--I don't know who he

00:17:33.394 --> 00:17:38.210
is but he seems to be on a lot
of these things [laughter]

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.509
but the thing is you don't need
to rely on him.

00:17:42.509 --> 00:17:43.930
You don't need to rely on
Western faces.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.533
Even if you go on line there's,
by now, a lot of databases from

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:50.730
faces from all sorts of genders
and national origins.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.099
This is from a Japanese women
facial expressions.

00:17:54.099 --> 00:17:57.368
And there are some subtle and
very interesting differences

00:17:57.368 --> 00:18:00.579
across countries and across
people, but there's also deep

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:03.585
universals.
You don't have to work very

00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:08.114
hard to figure out what these
different facial expressions

00:18:08.114 --> 00:18:10.238
mean.
I want to give one more face

00:18:10.238 --> 00:18:13.110
example because I want to focus
on this a little bit.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.734
This one's a little bit easier.
Raise the corners of your lips

00:18:16.734 --> 00:18:17.640
back and up, please.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:27.337
[laughter] Raise your cheeks.
Raise your lower eyelids if you

00:18:27.337 --> 00:18:30.110
can.
[laughter] They're smiling.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:35.410
You're smiling.
You can stop [laughter] smiling.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.170
Yale is actually really big on
smiling.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.980
We have two of the world's
experts on smiling.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.168
This is Angus Trumble,
the curator at the British Art

00:18:46.168 --> 00:18:49.390
Gallery who wrote this wonderful
book,

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.732
A Brief History of the
Smile looking at the smile

00:18:52.732 --> 00:18:54.781
in art.
And this is my colleague,

00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:57.665
Marianne LaFrance,
who is actually not smiling in

00:18:57.665 --> 00:19:01.390
that picture but she studies
smiling and smiling in adults,

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.232
smiling in children,
smiling across cultures,

00:19:04.232 --> 00:19:07.009
and the different social uses
of smiling.

00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:10.842
And there are some interesting
discoveries people have made

00:19:10.842 --> 00:19:14.080
about smiles and about smiles
and the emotions.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.657
One--Oh.
Well, one is that smiles are

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:21.589
universal.
We know, for instance,

00:19:21.589 --> 00:19:25.483
that young children smile.
This is my son,

00:19:25.483 --> 00:19:31.621
Zachary, when he was younger,
not that weird-looking kid

00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:34.300
[laughs]
next to him.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:40.224
[laughter] Thank God.
[laughter]

00:19:40.224 --> 00:19:44.994
And even blind children,
children blind from birth,

00:19:44.994 --> 00:19:48.019
will smile.
They'll smile appropriately,

00:19:48.019 --> 00:19:51.338
making an important point that
smiling is not learned by

00:19:51.338 --> 00:19:56.154
looking at other people's faces.
Smiling is also not uniquely

00:19:56.154 --> 00:20:01.180
human.
Nonhuman primates smile as well.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:07.157
Smiles are social signals.
You might imagine that people

00:20:07.157 --> 00:20:12.010
smile when they're happy.
This is actually not the case.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:17.221
It's not as simple as that.
Rather, people smile when they

00:20:17.221 --> 00:20:23.062
wish to communicate happiness
and we know that from several

00:20:23.062 --> 00:20:25.627
studies.
There are some studies of

00:20:25.627 --> 00:20:27.900
bowlers and the studies are very
nice.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.660
What they do is they film
bowlers.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.585
So, the bowlers do their
bowling and sometimes they knock

00:20:33.585 --> 00:20:36.670
down all the pins,
which is called a what?

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.354
A strike.
So a strike--and that's good in

00:20:39.354 --> 00:20:41.777
the bowling world.
So, they knock down all the

00:20:41.777 --> 00:20:44.607
pins but what they don't do,
is they don't smile after they

00:20:44.607 --> 00:20:46.960
knock down the pins.
They are being filmed.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.823
They don't smile.
Then they turn around to their

00:20:50.823 --> 00:20:55.259
friends and give a big grin.
Other studies have looked at

00:20:55.259 --> 00:20:59.619
films of people who have just
won Olympic gold medals.

00:20:59.619 --> 00:21:03.916
Now, not surprisingly,
people who have won Olympic

00:21:03.916 --> 00:21:07.741
gold medals are very happy.
This is good news to win an

00:21:07.741 --> 00:21:11.573
Olympic gold medal.
But they don't actually stand

00:21:11.573 --> 00:21:15.900
on the podium grinning.
Rather, they stand there with

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.309
their faces in a normal
expression.

00:21:18.309 --> 00:21:21.604
Then when they stand up and
face the crowds,

00:21:21.604 --> 00:21:26.154
there's a big smile.
You can ask yourself whether

00:21:26.154 --> 00:21:30.963
during sex, an activity where
many people enjoy,

00:21:30.963 --> 00:21:35.259
whether or not people smile
during sex.

00:21:35.259 --> 00:21:43.462
And you can discover this
yourself with [laughter]

00:21:43.462 --> 00:21:48.735
a partner or a mirror.
[laughter]

00:21:48.735 --> 00:21:54.890
So, there are other things we
know about smiles.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:58.279
There are different types of
smiles.

00:21:58.279 --> 00:22:01.842
There are actually quite a few
different types of smiles that

00:22:01.842 --> 00:22:03.980
are different in interesting
ways.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.770
This is Paul Ekman again.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.604
Which one's a better smile?
Who votes for the one on the

00:22:13.604 --> 00:22:16.457
right?
Who votes for the one on the

00:22:16.457 --> 00:22:18.727
left?
There are two different sorts

00:22:18.727 --> 00:22:22.807
of smiles.
The one on the right is a smile

00:22:22.807 --> 00:22:26.618
of greeting.
It's sometimes known as a "Pan

00:22:26.618 --> 00:22:29.341
Am" smile.
Pan Am is a now defunct airline

00:22:29.341 --> 00:22:32.565
which had at that time--They
were--They don't call them

00:22:32.565 --> 00:22:35.849
stewardesses anymore but
they're--the stewardesses would

00:22:35.849 --> 00:22:39.420
come in and they would smile.
That was part of their job.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.938
But it was a big,
fake smile, the Pan Am smile,

00:22:42.938 --> 00:22:47.451
a smile to communicate "hello"
and--but it's as opposed to a

00:22:47.451 --> 00:22:52.269
smile where the communication is
that of genuine happiness.

00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:54.390
The difference is around the
eyes.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.180
It's not the mouth.
It's the eyes.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.550
A real happiness smile,
what's known as a Duchenne

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:05.743
smile, after a neurophysiologist
who studied it,

00:23:05.743 --> 00:23:10.471
involves moving the eyes.
What's interesting is about

00:23:10.471 --> 00:23:15.230
only one out of every ten people
can fake a Duchenne smile.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:20.789
So, if you smile at somebody,
and you just hate their guts

00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:26.704
but you want to smile at them,
it's--unless you're quite

00:23:26.704 --> 00:23:33.970
gifted it's difficult to fake a
really good, really happy smile.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:38.161
You could--It's not difficult
to study smiles in the real

00:23:38.161 --> 00:23:40.634
world.
You could look at politicians,

00:23:40.634 --> 00:23:43.230
for instance.
Politicians are often in

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.170
contexts where they have to
smile a lot.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:50.559
And what they do is they simply
give the Pan Am smile.

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:53.172
The mouth moves up,
particularly if somebody is

00:23:53.172 --> 00:23:55.500
attacking their record or
ridiculing them,

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.680
and they'll smile and--but it's
not a sincere smile.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.986
The eyes don't move.
My favorite example of this was

00:24:01.986 --> 00:24:05.859
a few years ago when there was a
huge battle for the House

00:24:05.859 --> 00:24:09.214
majority leader.
And a guy named--a Republican

00:24:09.214 --> 00:24:12.988
named John Boehner won this
position in quite a heated

00:24:12.988 --> 00:24:15.334
battle.
And they took a picture of the

00:24:15.334 --> 00:24:18.288
guy--This is not very nice.
They took a picture of the guy,

00:24:18.288 --> 00:24:22.686
Roy Blunt, as he stepped out.
And he had lost and this was

00:24:22.686 --> 00:24:25.571
his expression.
[laughter]

00:24:25.571 --> 00:24:30.215
And he's not really very happy
[laughter]

00:24:30.215 --> 00:24:36.950
as opposed to a smile like
this, which is a real smile.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:42.689
So, you have two sorts of
smiles: A real happiness smile a

00:24:42.689 --> 00:24:48.630
Duchenne smile--called--also
known as the Duchenne smile,

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:55.079
and then a Pan Am smile,
or greeting smile.

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:58.479
And you'll use each of those
smiles at different points in

00:24:58.479 --> 00:25:01.831
your day and in your life.
It turns out that these

00:25:01.831 --> 00:25:05.559
different smiles have real
psychological validity.

00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:09.026
They seem to sort of reflect
deep differences in your mood

00:25:09.026 --> 00:25:11.868
and emotions and thoughts.
Ten-month-olds,

00:25:11.868 --> 00:25:15.359
for instance,
give different sorts of smiles.

00:25:15.359 --> 00:25:19.251
When their mother approaches
there they give a real happiness

00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:21.456
smile.
Then when a stranger approaches

00:25:21.456 --> 00:25:24.830
or someone else approaches there
they'll tend to give more of a

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:28.413
greeting smile.
John Gottman studied married

00:25:28.413 --> 00:25:31.079
couples.
And John Gottman does a lot of

00:25:31.079 --> 00:25:34.920
work--Well, what he does is he
looks at film clips of couples.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:40.086
And by analyzing the film clips
he tries to predict will their

00:25:40.086 --> 00:25:43.612
marriages survive.
And one of his cues--There's

00:25:43.612 --> 00:25:45.710
different cues.
Incidentally,

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.668
sort of side topic:
The death knell for a marriage

00:25:49.668 --> 00:25:52.900
for Gottman--This is his big
finding.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.855
It's not if they fight a lot.
It's not they scream at each

00:25:56.855 --> 00:26:00.344
other.
It's not even if they hate each

00:26:00.344 --> 00:26:03.922
other.
The death knell of a marriage

00:26:03.922 --> 00:26:07.483
is contempt.
And so, if he shows these

00:26:07.483 --> 00:26:11.301
clips: I walk in,
"Honey, I'm home," and my

00:26:11.301 --> 00:26:16.029
spouse has the look of contempt,
it's a bad sign.

00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:18.257
[laughter]
But another clue is the sort of

00:26:18.257 --> 00:26:21.517
smiles they give when they see
each other when they walk into

00:26:21.517 --> 00:26:24.671
the lab.
If it's a true happiness smile,

00:26:24.671 --> 00:26:29.432
that's actually bodes better
for the relationship than a Pan

00:26:29.432 --> 00:26:34.207
Am, or greeting smile.
Finally, studies have been done

00:26:34.207 --> 00:26:39.189
of college yearbook photos
looking at people thirty years

00:26:39.189 --> 00:26:42.250
later.
And it turns out that there's a

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:46.115
correlation, a reliable
relationship between how happy

00:26:46.115 --> 00:26:50.345
somebody is now and back thirty
years ago in their yearbook

00:26:50.345 --> 00:26:53.700
photo--what sort of smile
they're giving.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.380
There is some evidence for a
third sort of smile.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:04.329
This is known as a coy smile or
an appeasement smile.

00:27:04.329 --> 00:27:08.529
This is sort of a very
specialized sort of smile.

00:27:08.529 --> 00:27:13.420
This is a smile of
embarrassment or stress.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:18.039
You give it when you want
people to like you,

00:27:18.039 --> 00:27:22.129
you want to join in;
you want to make people feel

00:27:22.129 --> 00:27:24.287
positive about you.
But you're in,

00:27:24.287 --> 00:27:27.582
sort of, a high-stress
situation often with some sort

00:27:27.582 --> 00:27:31.406
of risk.
And what you do is you sort of

00:27:31.406 --> 00:27:34.039
you turn away.
There's no eye contact.

00:27:34.039 --> 00:27:37.220
You turn away and kind of give
this-- And this actually shows

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:43.660
up in other primates.
Here's a nice picture.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.546
[laughter]
So, the rhesus monkey bites her

00:27:45.546 --> 00:27:47.983
own infant, and the infant gives
a scream and then the

00:27:47.983 --> 00:27:51.042
submissive, coy smile.
And it also shows up in human

00:27:51.042 --> 00:27:53.329
infants.
Here's a nice clip of a coy

00:27:53.329 --> 00:27:55.569
baby smile.
I'll walk you through it.

00:27:55.569 --> 00:27:58.580
The baby is being approached,
[laughter]

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.205
goes like this ,
smiles like this ,

00:28:01.205 --> 00:28:04.660
and then the aversion .
Yeah.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.972
Babies are cute.
[laughter]

00:28:08.972 --> 00:28:11.390
Any questions at this point
about smiling?

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:22.680
What are your smiling questions?
[laughter] Yeah.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.177
Student: Do nonhuman
primates' smiles [inaudible]

00:28:25.177 --> 00:28:27.630
Professor Paul Bloom:
That's a good question.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.841
I don't know.
There's evidence that the coy

00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:33.277
smile shows up in non--The
question was,

00:28:33.277 --> 00:28:37.150
"Do nonhuman primates give the
same smiles that humans do?"

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.076
such as a distinction between
the Pan Am smile,

00:28:40.076 --> 00:28:42.749
a greeting smile,
versus a genuine smile of

00:28:42.749 --> 00:28:44.519
happiness?
I don't know.

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:46.240
I'll find out for you for next
class though.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.609
That's a good question.
Yeah.

00:28:48.609 --> 00:28:52.274
Student: How come some
people's smiles are better than

00:28:52.274 --> 00:28:54.502
other people's smiles?
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:28:54.502 --> 00:28:56.107
How come some people's smiles
are better than other people's

00:28:56.107 --> 00:28:57.985
smiles?
The non-interesting

00:28:57.985 --> 00:29:02.295
psychological answer,
some people are better looking

00:29:02.295 --> 00:29:05.168
and there's more thing--
[laughter]

00:29:05.168 --> 00:29:10.829
but the deeper answer is some
people are better able to smile.

00:29:10.829 --> 00:29:14.923
Some people are better able to
use the cues to express true

00:29:14.923 --> 00:29:17.306
happiness.
There's something else about

00:29:17.306 --> 00:29:20.710
smiles which is going to come
up, which your question raises,

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:24.968
I think, which is going to come
up in--when we talk about

00:29:24.968 --> 00:29:27.630
emotional contagion and
actually,

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:32.109
some issues of morality.
Smiles are extremely contagious.

00:29:32.109 --> 00:29:35.486
So, what I'd like people to
do--If you're sitting next to

00:29:35.486 --> 00:29:39.104
somebody, please turn around and
find someone next to you and

00:29:39.104 --> 00:29:40.800
look at them.
Don't do anything.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.812
Just look at them.
Whoever is being looked at,

00:29:43.812 --> 00:29:45.370
look back.
[laughter]

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:49.480
This is not-- [laughter]
Please arbitrarily decide.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.393
Okay.
Please arbitrarily decide on

00:29:52.393 --> 00:29:54.433
the smiler.
That will be--No,

00:29:54.433 --> 00:29:56.787
not at me, at each other,
[laughter]

00:29:56.787 --> 00:30:00.889
and that will be the person--If
you are unable to resolve this

00:30:00.889 --> 00:30:03.544
dispute--yes,
you two, please--if you are

00:30:03.544 --> 00:30:06.753
unable to resolve this dispute,
the person to the right of me

00:30:06.753 --> 00:30:10.460
will be the smiler.
So, look at each other

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.164
expressionless.
[laughter]

00:30:13.164 --> 00:30:16.793
Now, the person who is the
mandated smiler,

00:30:16.793 --> 00:30:19.990
[laughter]
on three, please smile.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:28.930
One, two, three.
[laughter] Okay.

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:33.273
[laughter]
Worst class demo ever

00:30:33.273 --> 00:30:38.737
[laughter]
but if one could imagine more

00:30:38.737 --> 00:30:44.952
restrained circumstances,
it is actually extremely

00:30:44.952 --> 00:30:50.513
difficult to be facing somebody
who's really smiling at you and

00:30:50.513 --> 00:30:52.522
not smile.
This is true,

00:30:52.522 --> 00:30:55.569
by the way, for virtually every
other emotion.

00:30:55.569 --> 00:30:59.462
The phenomena is known as
"emotional contagion," where if

00:30:59.462 --> 00:31:02.075
you're facing somebody,
for instance,

00:31:02.075 --> 00:31:05.849
and they're--they look at you
in a face of absolute rage,

00:31:05.849 --> 00:31:09.824
it is very difficult to just
sit there without your own face

00:31:09.824 --> 00:31:13.819
molding in accord to their own.
And the reasons why this

00:31:13.819 --> 00:31:17.807
happens and how that works is
something we'll talk about later

00:31:17.807 --> 00:31:23.180
on.
So that's--One more question.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.237
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

00:31:26.237 --> 00:31:30.835
Professor Paul Bloom: I
don't know if that's--The

00:31:30.835 --> 00:31:33.886
question is,
"Is there a difference between

00:31:33.886 --> 00:31:37.180
smiling with your teeth versus
just your lips closed?"

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.452
There probably is.
That's not a main smile

00:31:40.452 --> 00:31:44.450
difference but my bet is that
there probably is a difference.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:47.696
And my bet also is that that
sort of distinction,

00:31:47.696 --> 00:31:50.470
how much teeth you show when
you smile,

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:54.060
is the sort of thing that would
show regional and country by

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.982
country differences.
For instance,

00:31:55.982 --> 00:31:58.537
there's been research finding
that people in England smile

00:31:58.537 --> 00:32:00.599
different from people in the
United States.

00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:03.387
And I think that those are the
sort of contrasts that you would

00:32:03.387 --> 00:32:05.500
expect to find in cross-cultural
differences.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.975
Every culture is going to have
Pan Am smiles,

00:32:07.975 --> 00:32:10.563
happiness smiles,
coy smiles, but the variation

00:32:10.563 --> 00:32:13.882
of that sort is something which
will vary as a result of how

00:32:13.882 --> 00:32:16.470
you're raised and the people
around you.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.135
I want to deal with a few
emotions in this class and next

00:32:27.135 --> 00:32:31.117
and the first case study of an
emotion I want to deal with is

00:32:31.117 --> 00:32:34.571
the emotion of fear.
And I want to deal with fear

00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:37.920
for different reasons.
One reason is it's a basic

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.069
emotion, it's universal.
All humans have it.

00:32:41.069 --> 00:32:43.495
Many nonhumans,
probably most nonhuman,

00:32:43.495 --> 00:32:46.788
species have it too.
And it also brings us back to

00:32:46.788 --> 00:32:50.501
the lecture on behaviorism where
we talked about classical

00:32:50.501 --> 00:32:53.953
conditioning and different
theories of what people are

00:32:53.953 --> 00:32:59.339
afraid of.
It's a nonsocial emotion.

00:32:59.339 --> 00:33:02.610
What I mean by this is it's
possible, of course,

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:06.158
to be afraid of a person,
but unlike an emotion like

00:33:06.158 --> 00:33:09.289
gratitude, it's not
intrinsically social.

00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:12.039
You could be afraid of falling
off a cliff or something.

00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:14.960
It has a distinctive facial
expression again.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:21.656
This is a famous picture of Lee
Harvey Oswald who was being

00:33:21.656 --> 00:33:26.676
assassinated by Jack Ruby.
And this is the detective's

00:33:26.676 --> 00:33:30.051
face standing there,
a mixture of fear and anger –

00:33:30.051 --> 00:33:34.087
the face being drawn back in a
universal expression that every

00:33:34.087 --> 00:33:37.329
human everywhere would be able
to recognize.

00:33:37.329 --> 00:33:41.160
So, the basic question to ask
is "What are we afraid of?"

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:46.509
And the answer's a little bit
interesting.

00:33:46.509 --> 00:33:48.836
We're afraid of spiders,
snakes, heights,

00:33:48.836 --> 00:33:51.046
storms, large animals,
darkness, blood,

00:33:51.046 --> 00:33:54.012
strangers, humiliation,
deep water, and leaving home

00:33:54.012 --> 00:33:56.767
alone.
We are afraid of other things

00:33:56.767 --> 00:34:00.030
too but those are big things to
be afraid of.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:02.716
I'm not even going to ask.
If there's somebody who--in

00:34:02.716 --> 00:34:05.289
this room, who's not afraid of
any of those things?

00:34:05.289 --> 00:34:07.430
You're a tougher person than I
am.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:10.100
These are universal fear
elicitors.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.510
Why?
What do they have in common?

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.530
Why would you be afraid of
those things?

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:19.398
And the answer is--And why
would--why are there so few

00:34:19.398 --> 00:34:23.340
people afraid of guns,
cars, and electrical outlets?

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:27.210
The answer is not particularly
surprising.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:31.852
These are things
that--something's ticking over

00:34:31.852 --> 00:34:34.809
there.
These are things that are scary

00:34:34.809 --> 00:34:37.904
in our ancestral environment.
More particularly,

00:34:37.904 --> 00:34:41.174
these are things that through
the course of human evolution

00:34:41.174 --> 00:34:45.985
have been dangerous to us.
And so, we are afraid of these

00:34:45.985 --> 00:34:50.430
things and not so afraid of
these things;

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:55.642
similarly for nonhuman primates.
So, chimpanzees are afraid of

00:34:55.642 --> 00:34:58.820
certain things and they can
often develop phobias for

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.777
certain things,
but the phobias they develop,

00:35:01.777 --> 00:35:04.979
the fears they develop,
are things like spiders and

00:35:04.979 --> 00:35:07.380
snakes.
There was a nice study done in

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.019
urban Chicago,
in the inner city of Chicago.

00:35:10.019 --> 00:35:12.869
And they asked children raised
in the inner city,

00:35:12.869 --> 00:35:16.899
"What are you most afraid of?"
And you might think they would

00:35:16.899 --> 00:35:20.010
say, "I'm afraid of being shot.
I'm afraid of guns.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:24.632
I'm afraid of being killed by
somebody or being harmed by

00:35:24.632 --> 00:35:27.423
somebody.
I'm afraid of being run over by

00:35:27.423 --> 00:35:30.585
a car."
The two biggest fears of

00:35:30.585 --> 00:35:36.940
children in urban Chicago are
that , snakes and spiders,

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.199
even though many of these
children have probably never

00:35:40.199 --> 00:35:43.090
seen a snake outside of a zoo in
their lives.

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:46.568
These are natural fears.
There is some research done by

00:35:46.568 --> 00:35:50.632
the psychologist Judy DeLoache
at University of Virginia where

00:35:50.632 --> 00:35:54.230
she's studying babies' fears of
spiders and snakes,

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:57.972
babies obviously who,
since their parents are normal,

00:35:57.972 --> 00:36:00.780
have not yet seen spiders and
snakes.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.823
There are various ethical
reasons why you can't show

00:36:04.823 --> 00:36:09.103
babies--you can't try to
construct phobias in babies of

00:36:09.103 --> 00:36:13.384
spiders and snakes but the
research she's finding using

00:36:13.384 --> 00:36:17.226
more indirect methods finds,
as one would expect,

00:36:17.226 --> 00:36:20.780
these are what psychologists
would call "pre-potent stimuli";

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.723
that is, these are things that
naturally elicit fear and

00:36:24.723 --> 00:36:28.260
concern.
And that's all I have to say

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.852
about fear.
I want to turn for the rest of

00:36:32.852 --> 00:36:39.166
this lecture and for next
lecture next week to the social

00:36:39.166 --> 00:36:42.586
emotions.
And the social emotions can be

00:36:42.586 --> 00:36:47.030
broken down into two categories.
Bless you, bless you.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:51.832
Those emotions you feel towards
your kin, towards your genetic

00:36:51.832 --> 00:36:56.635
relatives, and those emotions
that you feel towards the people

00:36:56.635 --> 00:37:00.099
you're not related to but
interact with.

00:37:00.099 --> 00:37:06.963
And I want to focus
particularly on emotions that

00:37:06.963 --> 00:37:12.539
generate kind or altruistic
behavior.

00:37:12.539 --> 00:37:16.504
"Altruism" is the biologists'
term meaning kindness,

00:37:16.504 --> 00:37:20.936
generosity, and evolutionary
biologists have worked really

00:37:20.936 --> 00:37:25.290
hard to explain why animals
might evolve to be kind.

00:37:28.469 --> 00:37:33.748
A very old, very wrong view of
evolution is that evolution has

00:37:33.748 --> 00:37:38.940
shaped animals such that they're
merely survival machines.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:42.345
If so, then from an
evolutionary standpoint any

00:37:42.345 --> 00:37:47.009
kindness towards an animal--that
an animal shows towards another

00:37:47.009 --> 00:37:51.751
animal--is a mystery.
If evolution wired us up simply

00:37:51.751 --> 00:37:56.788
to survive, then it's a puzzle
why animals would relate

00:37:56.788 --> 00:38:03.969
positively to other animals.
But of course, that's not true.

00:38:03.969 --> 00:38:07.070
Here's a simple example showing
it's not true.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:10.073
Imagine two genes,
two sorts of animals each

00:38:10.073 --> 00:38:13.582
containing their own gene.
Gene "A" makes an animal care

00:38:13.582 --> 00:38:17.203
for its offspring.
Gene "B" makes an animal care

00:38:17.203 --> 00:38:20.848
only for itself.
Imagine what will happen in the

00:38:20.848 --> 00:38:24.660
next generation.
Plainly, Gene "A" will win out.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:28.581
It's a very simple case.
An animal who has evolved a

00:38:28.581 --> 00:38:31.451
brain that says,
"Take care of your offspring"

00:38:31.451 --> 00:38:35.086
will do much better from a
natural selection point of view

00:38:35.086 --> 00:38:38.530
from an animal who has evolved a
brain that says,

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.413
"Eat your offspring."
The animal that eats its

00:38:41.413 --> 00:38:44.630
offspring, those genes are a
biological dead end.

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:48.460
What matters then is not
survival, per se.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:54.143
What matters is reproduction.
And so, that simple fact is why

00:38:54.143 --> 00:38:58.422
we would expect animals to care
for their children,

00:38:58.422 --> 00:39:03.900
because children are the means
through which genes replicate.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.639
But it gets a little bit richer
than that.

00:39:06.639 --> 00:39:10.836
And this is one of the major
revolutions in evolutionary

00:39:10.836 --> 00:39:13.659
biology over the last half
century.

00:39:13.659 --> 00:39:18.630
Forget about the animal a bit
and take another perspective.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.500
Take a perspective of the cold
virus.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.390
People have been sneezing in
the front row.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:27.289
Now, you're coughing.
Thank you.

00:39:27.289 --> 00:39:29.900
Why do you sneeze when you get
a cold?

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:36.954
Here's not a-- Point made.
Here is--Here's not a bad

00:39:36.954 --> 00:39:39.215
answer.
You sneeze because you've got

00:39:39.215 --> 00:39:42.370
all these germs inside you and
your body wants to get the germs

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:45.457
out, so you sneeze.
It's not that it's totally

00:39:45.457 --> 00:39:49.709
wrong, but it's not bad.
The real answer is a little bit

00:39:49.709 --> 00:39:52.558
more interesting.
Don't look at it from the

00:39:52.558 --> 00:39:54.949
person's perspective.
If you have a cold,

00:39:54.949 --> 00:39:57.760
try to get away from your own
selfish perspective,

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.212
"I have a cold."
Look at it from the perspective

00:40:01.212 --> 00:40:04.835
of the cold virus.
The cold virus has evolved just

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:08.203
as much as you evolved.
And it's evolved due to

00:40:08.203 --> 00:40:11.823
survival and reproduction.
What the cold virus does is

00:40:11.823 --> 00:40:15.110
evolve different strategies to
cause it to reproduce.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:20.538
And what it does is--one way to
reproduce is to occupy other

00:40:20.538 --> 00:40:25.690
animals and manipulate their
bodies so as to expel it.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.812
From this point of view then,
the reason why you sneeze when

00:40:29.812 --> 00:40:33.795
you have a cold is that your
cold--the cold virus is using

00:40:33.795 --> 00:40:36.869
your body as a tool to replicate
itself.

00:40:36.869 --> 00:40:40.435
From this person--this
perspective, a person is just a

00:40:40.435 --> 00:40:42.789
germ's way of making other
germs.

00:40:42.789 --> 00:40:45.590
And there's tons of other
examples of this.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:50.028
There's a parasite known as
toxoplasmosis that lives in the

00:40:50.028 --> 00:40:53.635
bodies of rats.
But it gets passed on when the

00:40:53.635 --> 00:40:57.061
rats get eaten by cats.
And then it ends up in the

00:40:57.061 --> 00:40:59.860
cats' feces and then it ends up
back in rats.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.271
If you are a rat and you have
toxoplasmosis,

00:41:03.271 --> 00:41:07.159
you are perfectly healthy
except for one thing.

00:41:07.159 --> 00:41:11.820
The toxoplasmosis rewires your
brain and it makes you less

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:16.196
afraid of cats.
Now, again, this is not some

00:41:16.196 --> 00:41:20.570
sort of bizarre quirk of a
humorous god.

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:24.950
Rather, it's because this is a
perfectly--this is the adaptive

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:27.679
strategy of the toxoplasmosis
virus.

00:41:27.679 --> 00:41:32.076
In fact, a real powerful virus
would skip the respiratory

00:41:32.076 --> 00:41:36.079
system altogether,
even better than a cold virus.

00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:39.820
What it would do is it would
take over the brain and it will

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.624
make people want to run around
and have sex with other people

00:41:43.624 --> 00:41:46.687
and kiss them on the mouth.
And in fact,

00:41:46.687 --> 00:41:50.530
there is some evidence that
this happens.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.374
There's some evidence,
for instance,

00:41:52.374 --> 00:41:55.273
that one of the effects of
sexually transmitted diseases

00:41:55.273 --> 00:41:57.539
like syphilis is it arouses the
libido,

00:41:57.539 --> 00:42:01.019
makes people more sexually
engaged, because this is part of

00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:04.860
the strategy through which these
viruses replicate themselves.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.100
Imagine a virus,
for instance,

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:11.811
that captured an animal's brain
and then modified the animal's

00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:16.600
brain such that the animal would
run out and bite other animals

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.735
so as to pass on the virus.
And then, of course,

00:42:20.735 --> 00:42:23.590
you would call that virus
"rabies."

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:27.102
Along these lines,
the evolutionary biologist

00:42:27.102 --> 00:42:32.131
Richard Dawkins took the general
step of suggesting that animals

00:42:32.131 --> 00:42:37.079
are the vehicles through which
genes exploit to reproduce.

00:42:37.079 --> 00:42:40.556
From this perspective,
an animal is just the

00:42:40.556 --> 00:42:45.570
person's--is just the gene's way
of creating another animal.

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:49.388
Well, as psychologists,
what benefit does that--does

00:42:49.388 --> 00:42:53.834
this way of analysis give us?
It actually can help us explain

00:42:53.834 --> 00:42:56.744
altruism.
So, which genes are going to

00:42:56.744 --> 00:42:58.728
survive?
Well, the genes that survive

00:42:58.728 --> 00:43:01.085
are going to be the ones that
make the most copies of

00:43:01.085 --> 00:43:02.988
themselves.
Animals are vehicles through

00:43:02.988 --> 00:43:06.004
which genes reproduce.
An animal's merely the gene's

00:43:06.004 --> 00:43:09.750
way of making another gene.
Hence, selfish genes will lead

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:13.308
to altruistic animals because,
to the extent that evolution

00:43:13.308 --> 00:43:15.639
operates at the level of the
genes,

00:43:15.639 --> 00:43:20.977
there's no hard and fast
distinction between your own

00:43:20.977 --> 00:43:25.704
body and someone else's body.
And here's an illustration by

00:43:25.704 --> 00:43:28.848
the biologist Haldane.
So, Haldane was once asked,

00:43:28.848 --> 00:43:32.329
"Would you lay down your life
for your brother?"

00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:36.055
And he responded,
"No, but I would gladly give my

00:43:36.055 --> 00:43:41.100
life for three brothers or five
nephews or nine first cousins."

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:46.295
Now, he's joking.
You don't actually do the math

00:43:46.295 --> 00:43:49.832
if you're normal.
But what he's capturing is the

00:43:49.832 --> 00:43:55.150
logic, the ultimate causation of
our feelings towards our kin.

00:43:55.150 --> 00:44:00.187
Our genes have wired us up--our
brains up to love our children

00:44:00.187 --> 00:44:03.243
and love our kin because,
in this way,

00:44:03.243 --> 00:44:06.960
our genes manage to replicate
themselves.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.304
And in fact,
you get his calculations by

00:44:11.304 --> 00:44:16.524
looking at genetic relatedness.
The genetic relatedness,

00:44:16.524 --> 00:44:19.871
from an evolutionary
standpoint, affects how much you

00:44:19.871 --> 00:44:23.587
care for other people.
From the standpoint of your

00:44:23.587 --> 00:44:28.425
genes, you dying for the life of
three brothers is an excellent

00:44:28.425 --> 00:44:33.420
compromise because the genes
replicate by fifty percent more.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.130
If you imagined--;So,
here is his calculations.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:40.620
If you imagined a choice
between this one gene that makes

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:44.548
the animal choose to die and the
other gene that makes an animal

00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:48.513
choose for its brothers to die,
the gene that sacrifices the

00:44:48.513 --> 00:44:52.079
body it belongs to will make
more copies in the future.

00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:54.889
And there's an interesting
irony to this.

00:44:54.889 --> 00:44:57.687
The selfish gene theory is
often seen as sort of a

00:44:57.687 --> 00:44:59.800
cold-blooded evolutionary
analysis,

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.531
but it provides a scientific
basis for real,

00:45:03.531 --> 00:45:07.349
genuine altruism,
for really arguing that,

00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:11.569
from the standpoint of the
genes, there really is no hard

00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:15.940
and fast difference between
yourself and another person.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:19.329
From this perspective,
we can start to answer some

00:45:19.329 --> 00:45:22.719
interesting questions at least
about nonhumans.

00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:27.936
When a new male lion takes over
a pride what he does is kill all

00:45:27.936 --> 00:45:32.490
the remaining cubs and any
lionesses undergo spontaneous

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:35.836
abortions.
This all might seem very cruel

00:45:35.836 --> 00:45:39.190
but from a genetic standpoint it
makes sense.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:43.320
The other cubs are genetic
competition for him.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:48.117
They do not have his genes.
Moreover, only once they're out

00:45:48.117 --> 00:45:52.869
of the way can he reproduce and
copulate with the females.

00:45:52.869 --> 00:45:56.906
The females do their
spontaneous abortions because

00:45:56.906 --> 00:45:59.789
that's a reliable adaptive
trick.

00:45:59.789 --> 00:46:02.810
These cubs are not going to
survive once they are born so

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:06.369
the female's best strategy is to
get rid of them and start anew.

00:46:06.369 --> 00:46:09.865
From a psychological point
then, animals have evolved to be

00:46:09.865 --> 00:46:12.638
nice to their kin,
particularly their children,

00:46:12.638 --> 00:46:15.170
and particularly in birds and
mammals.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:19.178
Birds and mammals invest in
quality and not quantity,

00:46:19.178 --> 00:46:21.800
as opposed to fish and
reptiles.

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:27.279
For birds and mammals,
we don't have many kids but--so

00:46:27.279 --> 00:46:32.344
we devote a huge amount of
psychological energy to

00:46:32.344 --> 00:46:36.170
protecting the ones that we
have.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:40.408
Moreover, the kids we have are
vulnerable for long periods of

00:46:40.408 --> 00:46:44.133
time and require our resources.
So, there's various

00:46:44.133 --> 00:46:47.800
psychological mechanisms that
this gives rise to.

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.410
One is how parents or how
adults in general respond to

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.050
children.
Another one is how children

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:56.670
respond to parents.
And I'll briefly talk about a

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:57.680
few of these phenomena.

00:47:06.889 --> 00:47:10.050
Small animals make distress
calls.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.150
They chirp, they mew,
they bleat or they cry.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:17.134
The governing of a distress
call is actually an extremely

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:20.834
delicate high-wire act for any
young organism from an

00:47:20.834 --> 00:47:25.111
evolutionary point of view.
It has to on the one hand be

00:47:25.111 --> 00:47:28.144
annoying enough to actually
generate help,

00:47:28.144 --> 00:47:31.000
to get people to help you,
to feed you,

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.607
to pick you up,
to take you and put them next

00:47:33.607 --> 00:47:35.390
to you.
On the other hand,

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:39.226
it can't be so annoying that
the people around you kill you

00:47:39.226 --> 00:47:41.739
[laughter]
and so it's complicated.

00:47:41.739 --> 00:47:45.844
But, from your point of view,
you're wired up to respond to

00:47:45.844 --> 00:47:47.605
them.
That sound is,

00:47:47.605 --> 00:47:50.949
at very minimum,
extremely annoying.

00:47:50.949 --> 00:47:54.693
And it's more--it's not
annoying because of its volume

00:47:54.693 --> 00:47:57.360
or pitch.
It's annoying because your

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.869
brains are wired up so that that
baby cry is going to drive you

00:48:01.869 --> 00:48:05.723
up the wall.
On the more positive side,

00:48:05.723 --> 00:48:10.151
babies are cute.
I got this from Google Images,

00:48:10.151 --> 00:48:12.947
typing in "cute baby,"
[laughter]

00:48:12.947 --> 00:48:16.180
getting rid of the porn and
[laughter]

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:20.352
coming on to that.
No, no, Playboy,

00:48:20.352 --> 00:48:23.738
but anyway it was over that.
[laughter]

00:48:23.738 --> 00:48:27.492
And do not be tempted to say,
"Isn't it wonderful that the

00:48:27.492 --> 00:48:30.389
way nature works is that babies
are cute?

00:48:30.389 --> 00:48:34.590
Otherwise we would have killed
them."

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:36.300
[laughter]
That's not the right story.

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.454
If--Babies are not--Human
babies are not,

00:48:39.454 --> 00:48:42.976
sort of, metaphysically cute.
If Martians came down they

00:48:42.976 --> 00:48:44.260
wouldn't say,
"Oh, cute baby."

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.090
Rather, they're cute because of
how our brains are wired up.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:52.601
They're cute because there are
certain cues that correspond to

00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:55.600
the way our brains work.
And in fact,

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.659
this is how it works for all
mammals.

00:48:57.659 --> 00:49:02.225
So, babies have these big,
protruding foreheads,

00:49:02.225 --> 00:49:07.469
an upturned little nose,
chubby cheeks and big eyes.

00:49:07.469 --> 00:49:10.139
Those are the ingredients for
cute.

00:49:10.139 --> 00:49:12.586
Stephen Jay Gould has a
wonderful essay where he

00:49:12.586 --> 00:49:14.771
discussed this,
looking at the evolution of

00:49:14.771 --> 00:49:17.269
Mickey Mouse from the Walt
Disney character.

00:49:17.269 --> 00:49:20.519
Mickey Mouse starts off as an
ugly, little rodent.

00:49:20.519 --> 00:49:23.052
[laughter]
Over time he gets cuter and

00:49:23.052 --> 00:49:26.815
cuter and cuter as the artist
converged on more and more

00:49:26.815 --> 00:49:30.932
baby-like features.
Studies of adults show what's

00:49:30.932 --> 00:49:34.368
known as a baby-face bias.
This is not unique to the

00:49:34.368 --> 00:49:37.489
United States.
The same studies have been done

00:49:37.489 --> 00:49:40.562
in Asia.
You find a baby face in an

00:49:40.562 --> 00:49:45.086
adult, Leonardo DiCaprio,
to be particularly naive,

00:49:45.086 --> 00:49:49.150
helpless, kind and warm.
And in mock trials,

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:54.522
people with baby faces are more
likely to be found innocent than

00:49:54.522 --> 00:49:57.421
people like Ben Affleck,
[laughter]

00:49:57.421 --> 00:50:00.985
who do not have baby faces.
[laughter]

00:50:00.985 --> 00:50:05.662
Now, one question which is
going to come up for an entire

00:50:05.662 --> 00:50:10.339
lecture later on is "who is
sexier, the baby faced man or

00:50:10.339 --> 00:50:14.480
Testosterone Man?"
here .

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.895
[laughter]
And I am going to ask actually

00:50:15.895 --> 00:50:17.630
for a vote because I'm going to
return to this.

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:22.949
I do not--I only want the men
to vote, please.

00:50:22.949 --> 00:50:26.225
Who would go for--And forget
the fact that he looks sort of

00:50:26.225 --> 00:50:28.758
unhappy.
Who would go for Ben Affleck

00:50:28.758 --> 00:50:31.380
here?
Okay.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.610
[laughter]
Who would go for Leonardo?

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:35.521
Okay.
[laughter]

00:50:35.521 --> 00:50:39.650
Well, the women votes would
actually be more complicated.

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:41.900
We will discuss when we get the
lecture on sex.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:46.414
Your choice will depend on
where you are in the menstrual

00:50:46.414 --> 00:50:48.381
cycle.
[laughter]

00:50:48.381 --> 00:50:53.932
Now, so far,
we're talking about how babies

00:50:53.932 --> 00:51:01.730
respond to--We're talking about
our responses to babies.

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:04.789
What about babies' responses to
us?

00:51:04.789 --> 00:51:09.339
Well, there's a very old theory
known as the "Cupboard Theory"

00:51:09.339 --> 00:51:13.591
proposed by the behaviorist B.F.
Skinner which argues that

00:51:13.591 --> 00:51:17.768
babies' attachment to their
parents is because the parent

00:51:17.768 --> 00:51:21.006
provides food,
characteristically breast milk,

00:51:21.006 --> 00:51:23.710
but it could be food from a
bottle or whatever.

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:26.670
And because of operant
conditioning,

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:29.970
the baby is driven towards the
adult.

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:37.872
An alternative theory is that
of Bowlby, which is that they're

00:51:37.872 --> 00:51:41.589
drawn to their mother for
comfort and social interaction

00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:45.049
as well as fear of strangers.
To test this,

00:51:45.049 --> 00:51:50.158
the psychologist Harlow
performed a series of ingenious

00:51:50.158 --> 00:51:55.456
experiments with nonhuman
primates distinguishing between

00:51:55.456 --> 00:52:00.659
what he called "wire mothers"
and "cloth mothers."

00:52:00.659 --> 00:52:03.880
And you'll see illustrations of
this to follow.

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.980
Wire mothers are mothers that
are built that they give food.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.586
They have a little nipple
attached and you can drink from

00:52:10.586 --> 00:52:13.370
it and give food to the baby.
And that's the baby's source of

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:15.619
food.
Cloth mothers don't give any

00:52:15.619 --> 00:52:18.389
food but they give warmth and
comfort.

00:52:18.389 --> 00:52:21.327
There was a while in the
psychology department where one

00:52:21.327 --> 00:52:24.105
professor was known to be
extremely supportive to his

00:52:24.105 --> 00:52:26.829
students but didn't really
provide much warmth.

00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:28.889
And he was known as the cloth
mother.

00:52:28.889 --> 00:52:32.555
And another one was very
productive and everything but

00:52:32.555 --> 00:52:35.147
provided no love.
And she was known as the wire

00:52:35.147 --> 00:52:39.144
mother.
But anyway, I'll show you the

00:52:39.144 --> 00:52:41.971
movies.
I have to warn you this third

00:52:41.971 --> 00:52:45.489
and final movie is an example of
why this research is not

00:52:45.489 --> 00:52:54.112
currently done,
but it illustrates an important

00:52:54.112 --> 00:52:59.429
scientific point.
Oh.

00:52:59.429 --> 00:53:02.800
Now him-- I think I'm-- They're
just more Google Images.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.690
[laughter]
I think I'll--I want to begin

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:07.647
next class by wrapping up and
explaining the Harlow studies in

00:53:07.647 --> 00:53:09.489
more detail and what they tell
us.

00:53:09.489 --> 00:53:13.070
And then we'll move towards
altruism, towards non kin.

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:14.670
I'll see you next week.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.116
Prof: All right.

00:00:03.116 --> 00:00:06.812
I'm Professor David Lummus and
Professor Mazzotta asked me to

00:00:06.812 --> 00:00:10.569
come in and substitute for him
today, since he's traveling and

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:11.740
can't be here.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.490
So, I guess we'll get started
and I just wanted to--

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.530
since there was a midterm last
time,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.493
remind you more or less of what
he was talking about wherever he

00:00:23.493 --> 00:00:24.360
left off.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.843
The last lecture,
I suppose, was about the

00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:35.460
relationship between Statius and
Virgil.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.485
The specifically poetic
relationship and the ambiguity

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:45.700
that arises in the father/son
relationship that's staged

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.640
between Statius and Virgil.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.457
So Statius recognizes the
centrality of Virgil for his own

00:00:53.457 --> 00:00:57.430
poetic career and his own moral
development,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.438
by saying, "through you I
was a poet and through you I was

00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:06.396
a Christian,"
but at the same time his poetry

00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:08.819
challenges that of Virgil.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:12.950
Professor Mazzotta concluded
stating that,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.113
Statius' poem is about a
tragedy--about the tragedy of

00:01:17.113 --> 00:01:20.765
birth,
while Virgil's is about the

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:25.789
history-making quality of the
event of birth.

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.408
That the Thebaid
challenged Virgil's account of

00:01:31.408 --> 00:01:36.991
the foundation and of history,
but he grew as a poet and

00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:41.989
converted to Christianity by
engaging with Virgil's own ideas

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:45.744
of history,
specifically with the fourth

00:01:45.744 --> 00:01:46.550
eclogue.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.845
There--there's a misreading,
so the generative quality of

00:01:50.845 --> 00:01:54.569
Virgil's poetry didn't--
wasn't intrinsic in the poetry

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.932
itself,
but was based on Statius'

00:01:56.932 --> 00:01:59.289
particular reading of the text.

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.555
Today, we're going to be
talking about Cantos XXIV and

00:02:05.555 --> 00:02:10.181
XXVI specifically,
but I'll be saying a few words

00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:14.346
also about Cantos XXIII and XXV,
as a kind of frame to those two

00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:15.128
canti.

00:02:15.128 --> 00:02:23.280
In these two cantos--XXIV and
XXVI--they continue the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.586
meditation and poetic
relationships that were going on

00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:36.758
in XXI and XXII with Statius.

00:02:36.758 --> 00:02:39.771
Now Professor Mazzotta in his
book, Dante,

00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:43.127
Poet of the Desert,
has pointed out that Dante

00:02:43.127 --> 00:02:46.620
utilizes the figural method of
reading history.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.620
What about the past
pre-figures, the present and the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.716
future in a poetic fashion in
order to understand the

00:02:56.716 --> 00:03:01.609
genealogy of poetry--
of poets--and in order to place

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.150
himself in a typological
genealogy of poets.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.658
In these canti,
Dante is engaged in a kind of--

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.930
in a sustained reflection,
Mazzotta says,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.925
on literary history and the
powers of literature to engender

00:03:17.925 --> 00:03:21.491
moral conversion,
and in probing the inevitable

00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:23.550
limits of poetic fictions.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.181
And there I quoted from his
book, Dante,

00:03:26.181 --> 00:03:27.750
Poet of the Desert.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.280
Now it says Canto XXIV,
which you read for today,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.031
follows directly on Canto
XXIII, with a conversation

00:03:35.031 --> 00:03:38.120
between Forese Donati and the
pilgrim.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.091
I want to say a few words about
XXIII, especially regarding the

00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:44.848
relationship between poetry and
gluttony.

00:03:44.848 --> 00:03:49.057
Now, although a number of
penitents are mentioned at the

00:03:49.057 --> 00:03:52.961
beginning of this canto,
Dante only speaks to two of

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:53.650
them.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.086
Forese Donati and Bonagiunta da
Lucca, and both of them are

00:03:57.086 --> 00:03:57.560
poets.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.909
The first one is specifically a
friend of Dante.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.960
Now Forese Donati was in
Dante's youth,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.326
like I said,
a friend and they exchanged a

00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:15.617
series of vituperative sonnets
in which they insulted each

00:04:15.617 --> 00:04:20.899
other back and forth,
and it was filled with language

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.459
of bodily sensation.

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:29.382
I suppose in this canto,
the language of the

00:04:29.382 --> 00:04:37.509
conversation between Forese and
the pilgrim sheds a new--

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.968
the memory of it causes a
bitterness in both Forese and in

00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:45.238
the pilgrim,
and the difference between the

00:04:45.238 --> 00:04:51.507
rhetoric of the two texts marks
a new moral vision in the

00:04:51.507 --> 00:04:52.740
pilgrim.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:01.374
Before in these sonnets,
they berated each other's wives

00:05:01.374 --> 00:05:04.199
and their vices.

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.550
In this canto,
they recognize each other.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.139
They treat each other like
brothers.

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.538
So it's really a reformation of
a poetic community that was in

00:05:13.538 --> 00:05:17.254
some sense distorted by
these--six sonnets,

00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:19.379
three for each poet.

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:25.300
In this canto,
the gluttonous are famished and

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.959
disfigured by hunger and their
penitence.

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:36.055
Donati's wife is recalled,
and she was treated with

00:05:36.055 --> 00:05:41.291
obscenity in the sonnets,
and she is remembered as a

00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:45.230
stilnovistic kind of woman whose
prayers,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.139
ironically, have helped Forese
arrive at the terrace so

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:51.050
quickly.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.483
In a way, it converts that kind
of gluttonous,

00:05:56.483 --> 00:06:03.247
bodily poetry into a different
kind of moralizing poetry,

00:06:03.247 --> 00:06:06.870
I suppose; it corrects it.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.684
Now I guess the
connection--another connection

00:06:09.684 --> 00:06:13.187
with gluttony is that Forese
along with a number of other

00:06:13.187 --> 00:06:15.939
Italian poets such as Cecco
Angiolieri,

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.519
he was probably the most
famous, was a burlesque poet,

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:21.819
and this was also known as
goliardic poetry,

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:24.788
so from gula,
Latin for throat,

00:06:24.788 --> 00:06:26.569
or for gluttony.

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:32.802
This oblique connection allows
Dante to speak about poetry in

00:06:32.802 --> 00:06:35.399
this canto of gluttony.

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:40.468
The real connection is that
it's a worldly type of poetry

00:06:40.468 --> 00:06:45.718
that doesn't look beyond itself,
beyond the concerns of the

00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:47.620
flesh, I suppose.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.490
I would like to point out at
the end of this canto,

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.865
Dante remembers their ribald
literary exchange with

00:06:56.865 --> 00:07:00.862
bitterness,
at lines 115 at the very end,

00:07:00.862 --> 00:07:06.410
he connects the period of his
friendship with Donati with a

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.810
dilemma back in the dark forest
in Canto I.

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:22.288
"If thou bring back to
mind what thou wast with me and

00:07:22.288 --> 00:07:26.110
I with thee, the present memory
will be grievous still."

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.144
So he's pointing out that he
has a different perspective on

00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:30.399
that time of his life.

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:35.060
"He that goes before me
turned me from that life some

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.959
days ago.

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:40.298
When the sister of him'--and I
pointed to the sun--'showed

00:07:40.298 --> 00:07:42.050
herself round to you.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.485
It is he that has led me
through the profound night of

00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:49.050
the truly dead with this true
flesh that follows him;

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:54.541
his succours have drawn me up
thence, climbing and circling

00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:58.613
the mountain,
which straightens you whom the

00:07:58.613 --> 00:08:01.360
world made crooked."

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:08.559
The mode--or I guess the change
that Dante experiences are both

00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:14.096
Virgil and Beatrice,
so he is pointing towards what

00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:19.160
makes him different from what he
was a few days ago.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.648
Actually, the exchange with
Forese was probably not that

00:08:22.648 --> 00:08:26.389
long before the composition of
the Divine Comedy,

00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:28.976
or at least,
not that long before the

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:32.210
fictional date of the Divine
Comedy.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:39.270
This, in reality,
is a prelude to how he

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.164
dramatizes the differences
between his poetry and that of

00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:47.527
his father's and brother's,
the ones that he meets in XXIV

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:48.240
and XXVI.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.500
That's just as a preface,
I suppose,

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.321
to what happens in XXIV where
Dante really just juxtaposes his

00:08:56.321 --> 00:09:00.509
own style of poetry with that of
his predecessors,

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:03.700
specifically embodied by
Bonagiunta da Lucca.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.836
It's interesting that
Bonagiunta who notices that

00:09:08.836 --> 00:09:15.043
Dante is different because
Bonagiunta da Lucca wrote a poem

00:09:15.043 --> 00:09:19.501
to Guido Guinizelli,
who we will meet in XXVI,

00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:23.210
criticizing how he had brought
the terminology of the

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.081
university,
the terminology of

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:26.639
epistemology,
and of metaphysics,

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:30.778
and of theology into the lyric
of love.

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:33.842
It's--that's probably one of
the reasons why Bonagiunta da

00:09:33.842 --> 00:09:35.080
Lucca comes out here.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.883
Not necessarily that he was
important for some specific

00:09:37.883 --> 00:09:41.554
reason to Dante,
but probably because of

00:09:41.554 --> 00:09:48.559
that--the fact that he came out
and noticed this in public of

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:51.830
Guinizelli-- this change.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:10:00.384
I'd like to have a look at--in
the text when Bonagiunta da

00:10:00.384 --> 00:10:06.090
Lucca comes out and addresses
Dante.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:11.120
He says at verses 49 through
51: "But tell me if I see

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.110
here him that brought forth the
new rhymes,

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.166
beginning with "Ladies
that have intelligence of

00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:18.928
love."

00:10:18.928 --> 00:10:24.952
It's Bonagiunta da Lucca who
recognizes Dante and

00:10:24.952 --> 00:10:30.041
specifically by the first line,
the incipit,

00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:33.941
to the poem that basically
makes the center of the Vita

00:10:33.941 --> 00:10:35.947
nuova,
the turning point in the

00:10:35.947 --> 00:10:40.823
Vita nuova,
as you all remember,

00:10:40.823 --> 00:10:47.481
because in this poem,
it marks the transition from a

00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:51.450
self-centered poetry of love
where the poet praises himself

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.048
obliquely by service to the
woman,

00:10:54.048 --> 00:10:57.904
to the lady whom he loves,
and his transition to a poetry

00:10:57.904 --> 00:11:01.828
of praise that is mingled with
metaphysical claims for the

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.000
lady's value.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.317
It's Dante's transition from a
courtly lyric to a more

00:11:09.317 --> 00:11:11.940
philosophical lyric.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:18.966
Now Dante responds to
Bonagiunta with a really

00:11:18.966 --> 00:11:23.019
beautiful phrase,
and he says:

00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:26.200
"And I said to him:
'I am one who,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.389
when love breathes in me,
take note,

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:32.409
and in that manner which he
dictates within,

00:11:32.409 --> 00:11:34.298
go on to set it forth."

00:11:34.298 --> 00:11:42.254
Dante is claiming his novelty
and at the same time he is

00:11:42.254 --> 00:11:49.774
saying--he's linking his own
writing of poetry to the

00:11:49.774 --> 00:11:53.389
activity of a scribe.

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:57.154
He says, "I take
note" when someone--when

00:11:57.154 --> 00:11:58.360
love dictates.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.600
So he's explaining his
inspiration.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:08.729
In Italian, the word for
'breath in' is spira,

00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:12.980
and he dictates within Dante.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:18.447
Now this inspiration,
I think, it needs to be

00:12:18.447 --> 00:12:23.294
understood in a
theological--needs to be

00:12:23.294 --> 00:12:26.899
understood theologically.

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:31.698
We'll go--I'm going to go onto
talk about Canto XXV which

00:12:31.698 --> 00:12:35.470
explains this retrospectively in
a moment.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:40.940
Let me say for now that
it--that the words noto,

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.129
'take note' in Italian,
and detta,

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:52.677
'dictate' in Italian,
point towards the inspiration

00:12:52.677 --> 00:12:57.717
as this breathing in,
as the Holy Spirit,

00:12:57.717 --> 00:13:00.928
as a movement of love within
the Trinity,

00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:07.154
and that Dante is explaining
how poetic inspiration is really

00:13:07.154 --> 00:13:11.408
a parallel to the unity of the
Trinity.

00:13:11.408 --> 00:13:18.649
This inspiration comes from
within, but it's like someone

00:13:18.649 --> 00:13:22.269
who dictates from without.

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:27.307
In the Monarchia,
Dante's political treatise on

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:32.251
empire, he describes God as the
only dictator,

00:13:32.251 --> 00:13:35.389
the only person who dictates.

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:41.236
We have to understand this
description of poetic

00:13:41.236 --> 00:13:48.951
inspiration as one coming from
an internal instantiation of the

00:13:48.951 --> 00:13:50.320
divine.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.154
So there is a connection
between this inspiration and the

00:13:53.154 --> 00:13:53.610
divine.

00:13:56.379 --> 00:14:01.163
Now Bonagiunta follows up on
this by professing to understand

00:14:01.163 --> 00:14:05.244
the knot,
the knot that kept him and he's

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:07.350
like,
the Guittone da Arezzo,

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.809
Jacopo da Lentini,
who is the notary,

00:14:09.809 --> 00:14:11.808
from arriving at that style.

00:14:11.808 --> 00:14:16.009
The tercet that begins at line
55, he says: "Oh

00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:18.149
brother,"
he said,

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:22.580
'now I see the knot that held
back the Notary and Guittone,

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.418
and me short of the sweet new
style that I hear;

00:14:26.418 --> 00:14:30.720
I see well how your pens
followed closed behind the

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.279
dictator which assuredly did not
happen with ours,

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:39.823
and he that sets himself to
examine further sees nothing

00:14:39.823 --> 00:14:43.460
else between the one style and
the other.'

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.090
And, as if satisfied,
he was silent."

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:51.515
Bonagiunta thinks--he has this
perspective that Purgatory gives

00:14:51.515 --> 00:14:55.298
him on his past life and he
understands that knot--

00:14:55.298 --> 00:14:59.865
the nodo is also used to
describe the sin of gluttony at

00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:02.149
the beginning of Canto XXIII.

00:15:02.149 --> 00:15:06.580
Here again, we have this lack
of moral understanding.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:17.851
It's like a moral perspective
in life being paid for in the

00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:23.100
after life, in Purgatory.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.756
The poetry that Bonagiunta
represents was one that

00:15:25.756 --> 00:15:28.251
concentrated on worldly beauties
and qualities,

00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:29.500
like I said before.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.220
It feigned a service to the
lady only to concentrate on the

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.940
self of the poet and it never
really went beyond itself.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.960
It was a self-reflexive kind of
poetry.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.802
In that sense,
it could be assimilated with

00:15:44.802 --> 00:15:47.561
gluttony,
in that it absorbed and

00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:51.750
imitated what came from without
offering forth anything,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.509
without being generous such as
the poetry of Virgil was.

00:15:54.509 --> 00:16:01.990
And it's interesting enough
Bonagiunta says,

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.639
"Him that brought forth
the new rhyme,"

00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:08.529
so he brought the new rhymes
forth,

00:16:08.529 --> 00:16:09.580
he offered them out.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.567
Bonagiunta is able to see the
difference between the two

00:16:14.567 --> 00:16:19.472
styles of poetry at this point,
but I think he doesn't

00:16:19.472 --> 00:16:24.279
recognize the kind of uniqueness
that Dante is claiming for

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:27.178
himself here,
because he says,

00:16:27.178 --> 00:16:32.860
"That your pens follow
close behind the dictator."

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.720
So he's pluralizing what Dante
says only about himself.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.410
He says in Italian,
I' mi son un che and

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.379
people have pointed out that
this--

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:49.480
'I am one who,' is both humble
and it's like,

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:57.139
'I am one who among others who
do this,' but it's also--

00:16:57.139 --> 00:16:59.408
it's also pointing out his
uniqueness.

00:16:59.408 --> 00:17:01.950
Others have pointed out that it
echoes,

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:10.130
line 314 of Exodus,
Ego sum qui sum,

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:13.940
this is what God says to Moses,
"I am who am,"

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.890
that this self-reflexive,
mi son un che,

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:23.617
is an expression of uniqueness,
couched in humble language.

00:17:23.617 --> 00:17:28.457
Dante is really pointing out
that he is doing something

00:17:28.457 --> 00:17:33.295
unique with his poetry,
that perhaps Bonagiunta doesn't

00:17:33.295 --> 00:17:36.608
really recognize the full
extent.

00:17:36.608 --> 00:17:40.160
He's--if there is a school of
the dolcestilnovo,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.920
if there is this Sweet New
Style which composes a school--

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.470
like the Sicilian school that
preceded it,

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.513
which I'm sure Professor
Mazzotta talked about in

00:17:47.513 --> 00:17:49.088
relation to the Vita
nuova--

00:17:49.088 --> 00:17:52.521
then Dante is creating
something new within that

00:17:52.521 --> 00:17:53.180
school.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.244
That's, I think,
what's going on here in those

00:17:56.244 --> 00:17:56.789
lines.

00:18:02.038 --> 00:18:05.542
I suppose what Dante is doing
in this canto,

00:18:05.542 --> 00:18:10.512
is marking an extreme contrast
between his own poetry and that

00:18:10.512 --> 00:18:13.608
of the people who came before
him.

00:18:13.608 --> 00:18:16.950
There is a line that divides
these two schools,

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.536
the Guittone,
who is a Tuscan poet who

00:18:20.536 --> 00:18:24.556
imitated Sicilian poetry,
the Sicilians who imitated a

00:18:24.556 --> 00:18:28.965
Provençal poetry,
he's detaching himself from

00:18:28.965 --> 00:18:34.650
them because of their lack of a
moral purpose,

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.318
I suppose, in their poetry,
which Bonagiunta recognizes

00:18:37.318 --> 00:18:38.210
retrospectively.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:47.189
Now I just wanted to point out
as the--as this conversation

00:18:47.189 --> 00:18:54.001
comes to an end,
Dante describes at tercet 64

00:18:54.001 --> 00:19:00.348
through 69, how the penitents
depart.

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:04.115
He says, "As birds that
winter along the Nile sometimes

00:19:04.115 --> 00:19:08.690
make a troop in the air,
then fly with more speed and go

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.521
in file,
so all the people that were

00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:15.134
there, facing round,
quickened their steps being

00:19:15.134 --> 00:19:17.950
light with both leanness and
desire;

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:22.074
and as one tired with running
lets his companions go on and

00:19:22.074 --> 00:19:26.269
then walks till the heaving of
his chest is so relieved,

00:19:26.269 --> 00:19:31.461
so Forese let the holy flock
pass and come on with me

00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:33.160
behind..."

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.118
I just wanted to point out the
contrast here;

00:19:36.118 --> 00:19:40.060
the image of birds probably
reminds us of the image of birds

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.400
in Canto V of the
Inferno.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.346
They were just--the sinners
were described as cranes who

00:19:46.346 --> 00:19:49.288
were being buffeted about by a
tempest.

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:52.518
They kept returning to the same
spot in a circle,

00:19:52.518 --> 00:19:54.200
like an eternal return.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:01.960
Here, the same kinds of birds,
these love poets,

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.690
are coming together in a troop
and moving along together,

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:07.950
and not only are they moving
along together,

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.269
they're moving forward.

00:20:09.269 --> 00:20:14.339
So there's a progress
that's--that opposes the

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:20.313
circularity of the storm of
birds in Inferno V,

00:20:20.313 --> 00:20:26.058
and this will come up again
also in Canto XXVI.

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:29.169
Now I know we didn't read it
for today, Canto XXV of

00:20:29.169 --> 00:20:31.730
Purgatory,
but I think it sheds some

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:32.338
light.

00:20:32.338 --> 00:20:35.551
I'm going to say a few words
about it, because I think it

00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:39.051
sheds some light on what Dante
is talking about in relation to

00:20:39.051 --> 00:20:39.970
inspiration.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:41.480
We talked about that earlier.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.950
Now what happens here is Dante
asks--

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.938
Dante is perplexed about how
the sinners can be punished with

00:20:50.938 --> 00:20:53.730
their bodies if they don't have
bodies,

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.578
so he asks this of Statius.

00:20:55.578 --> 00:20:59.518
The whole canto basically--he
asks this of Virgil I guess and

00:20:59.518 --> 00:21:03.259
Virgil says, it's better if
Statius explains it to you.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.964
The pretext of it all is,
how can this happen?

00:21:09.964 --> 00:21:11.603
What is the physics of it?

00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:15.509
What is the biology of the soul
basically in the afterlife?

00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:24.864
What Statius does in explaining
this, explains how God engenders

00:21:24.864 --> 00:21:30.210
the soul, how he creates the
soul.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:35.130
In placing the discourse of the
generation of the soul and the

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:39.807
body between two cantos that are
basically all about poetic

00:21:39.807 --> 00:21:43.142
inspiration,
Dante I think is drawing a

00:21:43.142 --> 00:21:46.009
parallel between divine
inspiration,

00:21:46.009 --> 00:21:48.880
divine creation,
and poetic generation,

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.598
and poetic creation.

00:21:51.598 --> 00:21:53.479
Student:
Can you say that again?.

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:55.838
Prof: Okay,
he usually has a parallel--

00:21:55.838 --> 00:22:00.170
he's making a parallel between
poetic generation,

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:05.278
inspiration from--and poetic
inspiration and the divine

00:22:05.278 --> 00:22:09.568
creation of the soul,
the inspiration of the divine

00:22:09.568 --> 00:22:11.588
in the creation of the soul.

00:22:11.588 --> 00:22:13.220
I'm going to go on and explain
what I mean.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.298
I'm just trying to--does that
make sense?

00:22:15.298 --> 00:22:15.796
Student:
Yes..

00:22:15.796 --> 00:22:16.589
Prof: Okay,
all right.

00:22:16.589 --> 00:22:20.819
I'll slow down a second.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.653
Basically he's staging here the
relationship between

00:22:29.653 --> 00:22:34.275
predecessors and new poets,
so himself and his past

00:22:34.275 --> 00:22:35.568
basically.

00:22:35.568 --> 00:22:39.157
He's explaining how he is born
out of the past but is not

00:22:39.157 --> 00:22:43.259
imitative, and is not--can't be
merely reducible to that past.

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.970
I can read a little bit of this.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:54.940
It's a bit scholastic I
suppose, but it's okay.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.156
I can read it all;
it might explain it better for

00:22:58.156 --> 00:22:58.558
you.

00:22:58.558 --> 00:23:08.338
He says at lines 38--37,38:
"Perfect blood,

00:23:08.338 --> 00:23:12.153
which is never drunk by the
thirsty veins and is left like

00:23:12.153 --> 00:23:14.630
food thou removest from the
table,

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:19.011
takes in the heart informing
power for all the bodily

00:23:19.011 --> 00:23:21.606
members,
like that which takes its

00:23:21.606 --> 00:23:24.410
course through the veins to
become these.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.900
Further digested,
it descends where silence is

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.701
fitter than speech,
and thence drops afterwards on

00:23:31.701 --> 00:23:34.960
another's blood in the natural
vessel.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.548
There the one mingles with the
other,

00:23:39.548 --> 00:23:41.818
and the one fitted to be the
passive and the other,

00:23:41.818 --> 00:23:44.489
on account of the perfect place
from which it springs,"

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:46.673
that is the heart,
"active,

00:23:46.673 --> 00:23:49.900
and this, so united,
begins to operate;

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.834
first coagulating,
then quickening,

00:23:51.834 --> 00:23:53.597
that to which,
for its material,

00:23:53.597 --> 00:23:55.588
it has given consistency."

00:23:55.588 --> 00:23:59.288
Here, I think it gets a little
bit more interesting,

00:23:59.288 --> 00:24:02.318
he says: "The active force
having become a soul,

00:24:02.318 --> 00:24:05.477
like a plant's,
but so far different that it is

00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:08.838
on the way and the other already
on the shore,

00:24:08.838 --> 00:24:12.160
then operates to the point that
now it moves and feels,

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.079
like a sea fungus,
and from that goes onto produce

00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:18.118
organs for the faculties of
which it is the seed.

00:24:18.118 --> 00:24:20.964
Now, my son,
develops and spreads the force

00:24:20.964 --> 00:24:24.826
that is from the heart of the
begetter, where nature makes

00:24:24.826 --> 00:24:27.130
provision for all the members.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:30.319
But how from animal it becomes
a child?

00:24:30.319 --> 00:24:33.779
Thou seest not yet..."

00:24:33.779 --> 00:24:37.030
I'm going to skip a little bit
more to the top of the next

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.509
page: "Open thy breast to
the truth that follows and know

00:24:40.509 --> 00:24:44.161
that as soon as the articulation
of the brain is perfected in the

00:24:44.161 --> 00:24:46.576
embryo,
the first Mover turns to it,

00:24:46.576 --> 00:24:49.000
rejoicing over such handiwork
of nature,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.884
and breathes into it a new
spirit,"

00:24:51.884 --> 00:24:55.953
he breathes into it just like
the inspiration that Dante

00:24:55.953 --> 00:24:58.839
claimed for his own poetry
before,

00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:02.068
"a spirit full of power,
which draws into its own

00:25:02.068 --> 00:25:05.208
substance that which it finds
active there and becomes a

00:25:05.208 --> 00:25:07.318
single soul that lives and
feels,

00:25:07.318 --> 00:25:09.650
and itself revolves upon
itself."

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:17.430
What I think is going on here
is that ostensibly--

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:25.068
basically, Statius describes
the creation of the body--

00:25:25.068 --> 00:25:27.410
the biological creation of the
body,

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:32.368
which comes from the mingling
of bloods, right?

00:25:32.368 --> 00:25:36.759
Then after that,
how the animal that is created,

00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:40.220
basically, is given a soul by
God but becomes a rational--

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.710
becomes a human being and the
human being--

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:46.073
the human here is described--he
translates it as a 'child' but

00:25:46.073 --> 00:25:48.828
the word that's actually used is
a fante.

00:25:48.828 --> 00:25:52.700
Now fante would be
basically--

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.220
it's derived from the Greek
word for speech,

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.529
so a fante would be--one who
speaks,

00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:59.970
so how an animal becomes one
who speaks.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:04.119
So humanity is defined in a
sense by the fact that we can

00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:06.269
speak and reason basically.

00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:13.796
So what happens here,
I suppose, is that even though

00:26:13.796 --> 00:26:22.355
the father is the--generates the
body, the soul is directly

00:26:22.355 --> 00:26:25.160
created by God.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.798
So that there's two kinds of
individualities I suppose.

00:26:29.798 --> 00:26:32.978
You have the body and the soul,
and the soul is a uniqueness

00:26:32.978 --> 00:26:35.509
that is directly created and
inspired by God.

00:26:35.509 --> 00:26:39.880
If you consider this
poetically, even though Dante

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:44.338
may have been influenced or in a
sense created,

00:26:44.338 --> 00:26:49.471
by the poets that came before
him, nonetheless he has his own

00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:54.516
kind of direct inspiration that
separates him from the poets

00:26:54.516 --> 00:26:57.930
that came before him,
at least that's how I

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:58.779
understand it.

00:26:58.779 --> 00:27:02.089
I think it's connected that
Dante points out the connection,

00:27:02.089 --> 00:27:04.054
especially by the word
spira,

00:27:04.054 --> 00:27:07.140
he uses the word spira
or inspiration twice.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.509
They imitate each other,
they parallel each other.

00:27:10.509 --> 00:27:15.002
The connection between
fante,

00:27:15.002 --> 00:27:22.063
the child who speaks is a
direct connection to language,

00:27:22.063 --> 00:27:25.528
the language of poetry.

00:27:25.528 --> 00:27:30.736
That's, I think,
it explains retrospectively

00:27:30.736 --> 00:27:37.030
what Dante is claiming in Canto
XXIV about his poetic

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:42.468
inspiration,
this difference between his own

00:27:42.468 --> 00:27:46.500
poetry and that of his
predecessors.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:58.454
Now Canto XXVI,
he passes into the terrace of

00:27:58.454 --> 00:28:02.259
the lustful.

00:28:02.259 --> 00:28:08.181
Here he meets his own staged
poetic father,

00:28:08.181 --> 00:28:10.858
Guido Guinizelli.

00:28:10.858 --> 00:28:16.538
He recognizes his father and
his debt to his father,

00:28:16.538 --> 00:28:22.328
and at the same time,
he's recognized as a brother by

00:28:22.328 --> 00:28:24.000
his father.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.566
So his individuality as a poet
is recognized--the recognition

00:28:28.566 --> 00:28:29.858
is staged here.

00:28:29.858 --> 00:28:34.579
The paternal relationship
becomes a fraternal one.

00:28:39.058 --> 00:28:43.156
What I'm trying to point out
with this--the biological

00:28:43.156 --> 00:28:47.796
embryology is that he can be
seen as derivative and different

00:28:47.796 --> 00:28:49.420
at the same time.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.798
So he's the same and he's
distinguishable at the same

00:28:51.798 --> 00:28:52.118
time.

00:28:52.118 --> 00:28:57.960
This canto is in sharp contrast
to XXIV I think,

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:03.154
because Dante wanted to
distance himself from those

00:29:03.154 --> 00:29:08.868
poets in XXIV and here he wants
to show a similarity.

00:29:08.868 --> 00:29:12.856
He's trying to assimilate
himself with a certain kind of

00:29:12.856 --> 00:29:16.845
poetry that was--for which
metaphysics, epistemology and

00:29:16.845 --> 00:29:19.019
theology were all central.

00:29:19.019 --> 00:29:21.130
So it's a philosophical kind of
love poetry.

00:29:29.278 --> 00:29:33.057
I think he also redeems this
love tradition,

00:29:33.057 --> 00:29:37.979
which in a certain sense,
was condemned in Inferno V with

00:29:37.979 --> 00:29:39.210
Francesca.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.769
So this courtly love tradition
that was--

00:29:41.769 --> 00:29:48.854
that caused in a way I--or at
least Francesca claimed caused

00:29:48.854 --> 00:29:55.817
her downfall in saying that 'the
Galehault was the book' in

00:29:55.817 --> 00:29:57.500
Inferno V.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.578
Here he redeems it and he
purges it and cleanses it.

00:30:01.578 --> 00:30:09.001
You can start off by reading
the tercet that begins at line

00:30:09.001 --> 00:30:12.223
94,
whenever Guido Guinizelli

00:30:12.223 --> 00:30:15.759
identifies himself to the
pilgrim,

00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:19.798
it says: "Such as in the
grief of Lycurgus,

00:30:19.798 --> 00:30:22.440
the two sons became on seeing
their mother again,

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.683
I became, but with more
restraint, when I heard speak

00:30:26.683 --> 00:30:30.877
his own name,
the father of me and of others

00:30:30.877 --> 00:30:33.777
my betters,
whoever have used the sweet and

00:30:33.777 --> 00:30:38.323
graceful rhymes of love,
and without hearing or speech,

00:30:38.323 --> 00:30:43.912
I went on a long way and
thought gazing at him and did

00:30:43.912 --> 00:30:47.920
not for the fire go near
him."

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.778
Dante, I guess,
he loses his faculty of speech

00:30:50.778 --> 00:30:54.970
here, because he's in awe almost
like a child before his father.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:31:01.650
So his behavior imitates his
relationship to Guinizelli.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:14.914
I'll point here as well that
one of the main differences,

00:31:14.914 --> 00:31:19.730
I suppose, between the two
poets is symbolized by the

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.250
casting of the shadow on the
fire.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:27.250
His--the reality of his
presence there in his body,

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:31.970
is what's really--is what the
physical aspect that separates

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.890
him from the others.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:39.770
It stands in for the aspect of
his poetry that separates him

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:43.660
from the rest of these poets as
well.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:52.568
Since we're talking about
poetic genealogy,

00:31:52.568 --> 00:31:59.625
it's interesting that Dante
is--he refers to him as a father

00:31:59.625 --> 00:32:06.680
but then Guinizelli respond by
saying: "Oh brother,

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:11.296
he there whom I point out to
thee, was a better craftsman of

00:32:11.296 --> 00:32:14.738
the mother tongue,
verses of love and tales of

00:32:14.738 --> 00:32:17.470
romance he has surpassed them
all."

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:22.201
In these fifteen,
twenty lines Dante is a child

00:32:22.201 --> 00:32:27.653
before his father and is then
equated with his father,

00:32:27.653 --> 00:32:30.019
by being a brother.

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:32.685
So they're put on the same
level and they're assigned

00:32:32.685 --> 00:32:35.567
another father,
so the grandfather of them all

00:32:35.567 --> 00:32:37.782
becomes the father,
and this father,

00:32:37.782 --> 00:32:40.048
I guess, who's not named is
Arnaut Daniel.

00:32:40.048 --> 00:32:44.596
An important poet for Dante in
Le Rime Petrose,

00:32:44.596 --> 00:32:49.144
the 'Stony Rhymes' which
Professor Mazzotta mentioned,

00:32:49.144 --> 00:32:52.490
Dante imitated him in those
rhymes.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.805
He was a poet famous for his
difficulty in reading--it was

00:32:56.805 --> 00:33:01.045
very, very hard to understand an
example of the trobar

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:02.029
clus.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:11.660
In this same paragraph,
these same series of tercets,

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:16.491
paragraph in the English,
again we have the

00:33:16.491 --> 00:33:21.210
differentiation of the kind of
school,

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:25.015
I suppose, that Dante is
associating himself with and the

00:33:25.015 --> 00:33:29.160
other school with which he wants
to differentiate himself,

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:35.561
because he says that like
Arnaut is different from the one

00:33:35.561 --> 00:33:39.041
from Limoges,
so he is different from

00:33:39.041 --> 00:33:43.721
Guittone--Guittone da Arezzo who
is named alongside Bonagiunta da

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:45.990
Lucca and Jacopo da Lentini.

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:50.630
So he's separating himself
from--he's aligning himself with

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.109
the different kind of poetry.

00:34:00.588 --> 00:34:06.893
He kind of reinforces the kind
of genealogy he wants to create

00:34:06.893 --> 00:34:08.340
for himself.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.956
Now this genealogy too,
I guess, has its own

00:34:11.956 --> 00:34:17.172
consequences in the modern age
because the words in Italian for

00:34:17.172 --> 00:34:21.342
the better craftsmen,
il miglior fabbro were

00:34:21.342 --> 00:34:24.556
the words with which
T.S. Eliot dedicated The

00:34:24.556 --> 00:34:28.320
Wasteland to Ezra Pound,
as you probably know.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:35.739
This conversation here really
becomes an emblem for happy

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:40.373
poetic relationships,
I suppose, which you can

00:34:40.373 --> 00:34:42.297
recognize--
you're better at recognizing

00:34:42.297 --> 00:34:44.409
your forefathers,
and at the same time,

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:47.570
come out with something that
you recognize as new.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:57.239
Some scholars have pointed
out--we didn't--

00:34:57.239 --> 00:35:01.797
I don't think you concentrated
much on Inferno XXIV and

00:35:01.797 --> 00:35:05.686
XXV,
where Dante utilizes a number

00:35:05.686 --> 00:35:11.610
of metaphors from Ovid and Lucan
and he has this--

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.268
there's this topos called the
taciat nunc,

00:35:14.268 --> 00:35:17.829
be silent now Lucan,
be silent now Ovid he says,

00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:21.070
and he basically steals from
their lines without recognizing

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:22.601
them,
saying that he is surpassing

00:35:22.601 --> 00:35:24.630
them but at the same time as
he's surpassing them,

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:27.190
he's using their own poetry to
surpass them.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:30.532
People have pointed out that in
these canti of the

00:35:30.532 --> 00:35:33.043
thieves,
that Dante is participating in

00:35:33.043 --> 00:35:36.753
the sin by stealing from Ovid
and Lucan and that this kind of

00:35:36.753 --> 00:35:39.349
poetic relationship is a
negative one,

00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:41.969
that he's stealing the identity
of the other.

00:35:41.969 --> 00:35:44.768
Well here we have a different
kind of understanding about

00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:45.670
poetic identity.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:51.268
We have one that recognizes the
paternity of the father,

00:35:51.268 --> 00:35:55.262
while at the same time,
allows the son to come into his

00:35:55.262 --> 00:35:59.884
own,
and that's coming into his own

00:35:59.884 --> 00:36:05.552
is, I think,
pointed out by Dante the poet

00:36:05.552 --> 00:36:10.905
whenever he says at--
between lines 130 and 140:

00:36:10.905 --> 00:36:16.208
"Then perhaps to give
place to others who were near

00:36:16.208 --> 00:36:19.371
him,
he disappeared through the fire

00:36:19.371 --> 00:36:22.313
as though the water--
as through the water a fish

00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:23.510
goes to the bottom."

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:31.730
Here the father moves out of
his way so that Dante can go on

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:38.170
and I guess he can progress;
he doesn't get in his way.

00:36:47.659 --> 00:36:51.876
If Dante recognizes these
people, these poets as his

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:55.929
predecessors how does he
differentiate himself?

00:36:55.929 --> 00:36:58.697
How, in this canto,
does he differentiate himself

00:36:58.697 --> 00:36:59.389
from them?

00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:06.740
Then we can look at it through
the lens of Canto XXV where the

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:14.333
paternal virtue--the generation
of the soul granted the paternal

00:37:14.333 --> 00:37:15.659
virtue.

00:37:15.659 --> 00:37:21.235
Its place, while simultaneously
claimed a direct creation of the

00:37:21.235 --> 00:37:25.219
soul by the inspiration of the
Holy Spirit.

00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:29.445
I think Dante's poetic
individuality grows out of the

00:37:29.445 --> 00:37:32.007
artifice,
the style that they concentrate

00:37:32.007 --> 00:37:34.565
on here,
the sweet detti d'amore,

00:37:34.565 --> 00:37:38.590
the sweet sayings of love that
he attributes to Guinizelli,

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:43.268
so it grows out of the
stylistic artifice that these

00:37:43.268 --> 00:37:48.679
two poets represent are and
Guido to form something new,

00:37:48.679 --> 00:37:53.791
a new kind of speech,
a new kind of poetic speech

00:37:53.791 --> 00:38:00.072
that's imbibed with the divine
and guided by theological and

00:38:00.072 --> 00:38:01.989
moral meaning.

00:38:01.989 --> 00:38:07.041
I think we can see this and how
these pair of poets are cleansed

00:38:07.041 --> 00:38:10.570
and how they're represented in
this canto.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:14.347
For example,
Guinizelli, when he first calls

00:38:14.347 --> 00:38:17.949
out to Dante before we know who
he is,

00:38:17.949 --> 00:38:19.599
before he's even identified
himself,

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:22.239
I think it's around line 17 and
following,

00:38:26.219 --> 00:38:31.208
he says, "Oh thou that
goest behind the others not from

00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:34.590
tardiness but perhaps from
reverence,

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:38.130
answer me who burn with thirst
and with fire."

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:44.268
Now the line in Italian is e
in foco ardo.

00:38:44.268 --> 00:38:49.128
Now this is a direct quotation
of Guinizelli's own poetry in a

00:38:49.128 --> 00:38:53.036
sonnet which he says,
in gran pena e foco

00:38:53.036 --> 00:38:57.849
ardo, "in great pain
and fire I burn."

00:38:57.849 --> 00:39:00.880
So in foco ardo is
basically repeated verbatim.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:08.032
The love poet who's burning for
his lady metaphorically in his

00:39:08.032 --> 00:39:14.833
sonnet is now burning literally
in the penitent fire that's

00:39:14.833 --> 00:39:17.179
purging his sin.

00:39:17.179 --> 00:39:22.742
I think this punishment shows
how the perspective of Purgatory

00:39:22.742 --> 00:39:27.789
is really modifying--
giving us a moral sense to the

00:39:27.789 --> 00:39:31.884
love poetry that Guinizelli--
school of love poetry that

00:39:31.884 --> 00:39:32.940
Guinizelli belonged to.

00:39:38.449 --> 00:39:40.889
Another thing that
differentiates them,

00:39:40.889 --> 00:39:43.967
like I said before,
with Dante's shadow showing

00:39:43.967 --> 00:39:48.744
that he's actually there,
and that he's in his body,

00:39:48.744 --> 00:39:53.094
in the flesh,
points to something else,

00:39:53.094 --> 00:39:58.869
and that is that his lady is
actually the beginning--

00:39:58.869 --> 00:40:00.639
started a chain of grace.

00:40:00.639 --> 00:40:03.170
That there is a connection that
his--

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:06.755
not just a metaphysical
connection or epistemological

00:40:06.755 --> 00:40:09.239
connection and value to his
lady,

00:40:09.239 --> 00:40:10.869
but a theological value as well.

00:40:10.869 --> 00:40:15.663
Like he says at line 58,
"I go up hence not to be

00:40:15.663 --> 00:40:19.001
longer blind;
a lady is above who gains grace

00:40:19.001 --> 00:40:22.199
for me by which I bring my
mortal part through your

00:40:22.199 --> 00:40:23.159
world."

00:40:23.159 --> 00:40:27.307
What these poets couldn't
recognize in their own lifetime

00:40:27.307 --> 00:40:30.420
Dante is able to because of his
poetry,

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.039
this bringing together that he
does,

00:40:34.039 --> 00:40:37.460
which is actually the newness
in the Sweet New Style,

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.429
I think, which isn't just
metaphysical,

00:40:40.429 --> 00:40:41.590
but it's theological.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:54.050
To put it in another way,
if Guinizelli,

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.619
Arnaut Daniel,
Guido Cavalcanti,

00:40:56.619 --> 00:41:03.018
who's not mentioned here again,
if for these poets the lady was

00:41:03.018 --> 00:41:09.139
a philosophical or intellectual
phantasm I suppose,

00:41:09.139 --> 00:41:15.534
for Dante she is a real woman
who enacted a real change in his

00:41:15.534 --> 00:41:22.137
life and that caused that chain
of grace to descend into his own

00:41:22.137 --> 00:41:24.130
personal story.

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:27.036
His poetry, I think,
seeks to close the gap between

00:41:27.036 --> 00:41:30.358
the metaphysical,
theological reality of God and

00:41:30.358 --> 00:41:34.315
the historical contingent
reality of history and Dante's

00:41:34.315 --> 00:41:37.050
own personal story in that
history.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:44.449
Love poetry for Dante takes on
an entirely new meaning here,

00:41:44.449 --> 00:41:47.550
and I think Guinizelli shows
that he understands this

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.949
difference with a perspective
that Purgatory gives him.

00:41:50.949 --> 00:41:53.782
Towards the end of the canto
when he asks Dante to say a

00:41:53.782 --> 00:41:56.809
Pater noster for him,
to Christ whenever he enters

00:41:56.809 --> 00:42:00.302
heaven,
so it's really a conversion I

00:42:00.302 --> 00:42:05.038
think of love poetry,
a purgation of the worldliness

00:42:05.038 --> 00:42:06.280
of love poetry.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.056
Finally, I want to say--we're
going to end a little bit early

00:42:13.056 --> 00:42:16.030
because I actually have to run
to another building to teach

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.739
right after this--
my own class.

00:42:19.739 --> 00:42:23.590
I want to conclude by saying a
few words about Arnaut.

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:28.389
It's very peculiar that
Dante--this is the only place I

00:42:28.389 --> 00:42:33.277
believe in the Divine
Comedy where another modern

00:42:33.277 --> 00:42:38.610
romance language is quoted
that's not Italian basically.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.041
I could be mistaken,
but I'm pretty sure it's the

00:42:41.041 --> 00:42:41.699
only place.

00:42:41.699 --> 00:42:45.001
Now Arnaut was famous,
like I said,

00:42:45.001 --> 00:42:49.565
for his obscurity,
the extreme difficulty of his

00:42:49.565 --> 00:42:54.228
poetic expression,
and here what does Dante do to

00:42:54.228 --> 00:42:55.199
him?

00:42:55.199 --> 00:42:57.489
Even though he quotes him in
the original,

00:42:57.489 --> 00:42:59.429
he didn't really write these
lines,

00:42:59.429 --> 00:43:04.481
these lines are Dante's,
but what he does is he makes

00:43:04.481 --> 00:43:09.340
this difficult hidden poet come
out in the open.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:13.931
To quote him,
he says, "So much does

00:43:13.931 --> 00:43:20.934
your courteous question please
me that I neither can nor would

00:43:20.934 --> 00:43:24.150
conceal myself from you.

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:27.920
I am Arnaut who weep and sing
as I go.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:33.864
I see with grief past follies
and see rejoicing the day I

00:43:33.864 --> 00:43:36.199
hoped for before me.

00:43:36.199 --> 00:43:40.342
Now I beg of you by that
goodness which guides you to the

00:43:40.342 --> 00:43:45.150
summit of the stairway to take
thought and do time for my pain.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:48.018
Then he hid himself from the
fire that refines him."

00:43:48.018 --> 00:43:52.003
There's a little bit of
a--Dante's playing here with

00:43:52.003 --> 00:43:53.880
Arnaut's own language.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:44:02.018
If he was a difficult poet of
love,

00:44:02.018 --> 00:44:04.902
Dante really makes him come out
into the open and say what he is

00:44:04.902 --> 00:44:08.688
saying,
so--here also are typical words

00:44:08.688 --> 00:44:14.699
from the Provençal
tradition such as the value--

00:44:14.699 --> 00:44:19.894
valor, cortes and
cantant: they all take on

00:44:19.894 --> 00:44:22.969
different kinds of meaning.

00:44:22.969 --> 00:44:29.864
That before the valor,
or value of the love poet was

00:44:29.864 --> 00:44:34.730
not what it is here;
it takes on a completely

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:37.250
different meaning in Purgatory.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:44.119
He really stages in Arnaut's
own words the purification,

00:44:44.119 --> 00:44:48.849
cleansing, and bringing out
into openness of what love

00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:53.449
poetry should really be,
where it should really lead you.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:45:05.230
I guess to conclude I wanted to
say that in the next canto,

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:13.219
you'll see Dante submitting
himself to the same kind of

00:45:13.219 --> 00:45:17.510
purgation as these poets.

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:20.840
If these poets are cleansed by
this wall of--

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:26.288
by this fire that refines them,
he will end up passing through

00:45:26.288 --> 00:45:31.737
a wall of flame in order to get
to where he can enter into the

00:45:31.737 --> 00:45:33.969
terrestrial paradise.

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:45.059
So that he is in reality
cleansing himself of the same

00:45:45.059 --> 00:45:49.119
kind of issue,
I suppose.

00:45:49.119 --> 00:45:57.829
I guess now I can take a few
questions if you have any.

00:45:57.829 --> 00:46:01.623
Hopefully, it wasn't too
disjointed--the lecture,

00:46:01.623 --> 00:46:05.733
but I'm happy to answer any
questions you might have,

00:46:05.733 --> 00:46:06.840
or try to.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.079
Student:
In Canto XXIV,

00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:28.751
Dante refers to Statius as his
being more slowly than he would

00:46:28.751 --> 00:46:32.961
&gt;,
and I know that there's a lot

00:46:32.961 --> 00:46:36.789
of different critical
interpretations of that line,

00:46:36.789 --> 00:46:41.001
I'm wondering how we can
interpret it as sort of looking

00:46:41.001 --> 00:46:45.824
later to Canto XXV and the idea
of the proper father/son issues?

00:46:45.824 --> 00:46:50.572
Statius sort of by slowing his
journey towards God to stay with

00:46:50.572 --> 00:46:55.012
Virgil going against Dante's
idea or does--can we reconcile

00:46:55.012 --> 00:46:55.702
the two?.

00:46:55.702 --> 00:47:00.449
Prof: I think you can
reconcile them.

00:47:00.449 --> 00:47:05.313
I mean whenever Dante--whenever
he meets Guinizelli,

00:47:05.313 --> 00:47:06.650
he's silent.

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:09.998
He doesn't automatically make
himself--he doesn't move his

00:47:09.998 --> 00:47:11.409
father out of the way.

00:47:11.409 --> 00:47:14.809
Statius and Dante both know
that Virgil is not going to be

00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:16.420
able to go the whole way.

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:21.106
They know that he's only going
to be able to lead them a

00:47:21.106 --> 00:47:24.940
certain amount of the trip,
of the journey.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:30.976
So I guess--I would interpret
it as an act of reverence,

00:47:30.976 --> 00:47:37.235
just like Dante's silence,
whenever he meets Guinizelli is

00:47:37.235 --> 00:47:39.869
an act of reverence.

00:47:39.869 --> 00:47:44.320
He doesn't push them out of the
way and he doesn't trample them.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.190
He's not in a hurry, I suppose.

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:49.889
Does that make any sense at all?

00:47:49.889 --> 00:47:52.429
I think it's--the way you could
interpret it Statius is--

00:47:52.429 --> 00:47:56.307
if you want to see him
interpret that as him as slowing

00:47:56.307 --> 00:47:59.110
his way on the way to God
basically,

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:03.443
then you could interpret it as
an act of reverence to the

00:48:03.443 --> 00:48:07.545
person who allowed him to
actually be there and not in

00:48:07.545 --> 00:48:08.320
Limbo.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:15.590
That's how I would interpret
it, I suppose.

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:24.260
That Dante in this--in XXVI,
is reverent to his father,

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:28.614
so at the same time he is
showing how he's moving beyond

00:48:28.614 --> 00:48:33.048
him by giving a theological
meaning to their questionable

00:48:33.048 --> 00:48:34.949
worldly love poetry.

00:48:34.949 --> 00:48:39.860
Does that answer your question?

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:43.119
Student:
When Dante talks about the

00:48:43.119 --> 00:48:47.570
inspiration which you've
identified as the inspiration of

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:51.068
the Holy Spirit,
is he making love synonymous

00:48:51.068 --> 00:48:52.739
with the Holy Spirit?

00:48:52.739 --> 00:48:56.554
And if so, looking back at the
Vita nuova,

00:48:56.554 --> 00:49:01.324
when he personifies love in the
masculine I've always sort of

00:49:01.324 --> 00:49:05.777
thought of--in literature,
when you read religious poetry

00:49:05.777 --> 00:49:10.467
and stuff, the Holy Spirit's
often sort of a feminized noun,

00:49:10.467 --> 00:49:15.077
are those things one and the
same to him, love and the Holy

00:49:15.077 --> 00:49:15.713
Spirit?.

00:49:15.713 --> 00:49:21.199
Prof: I think there
that he's thinking of--

00:49:21.199 --> 00:49:27.500
I think at that point he's
thinking of love--

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:34.480
I think Thomas Aquinas mentions
love as the procession of love,

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.391
as the movement of the Holy
Spirit within the Trinity

00:49:38.391 --> 00:49:43.702
between the Father and the Son,
so that both really are

00:49:43.702 --> 00:49:48.489
within--participate in the same
spirit.

00:49:48.489 --> 00:49:53.726
So yes I think in that spot,
he is really talking about love

00:49:53.726 --> 00:49:58.163
as the Holy Spirit,
as this kind of--or at least as

00:49:58.163 --> 00:49:59.849
parallel to it.

00:49:59.849 --> 00:50:01.000
It's ambiguous.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.085
He says--he doesn't really say
that love is the Holy Spirit

00:50:05.085 --> 00:50:05.789
does he?

00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:10.572
He's purposefully ambiguous I
think, because love poetry

00:50:10.572 --> 00:50:15.268
always has that--the possibility
of leading you astray,

00:50:15.268 --> 00:50:18.659
because it's an aesthetic
practice.

00:50:18.659 --> 00:50:21.518
It's dolce;
it's sweet.

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:27.728
So I think that the--that yes
he is talking about love as the

00:50:27.728 --> 00:50:30.576
Holy Spirit,
as this divine love,

00:50:30.576 --> 00:50:34.521
but he's also talking about--
so I guess in reality that

00:50:34.521 --> 00:50:38.989
there is a connection between
the contingent and historical

00:50:38.989 --> 00:50:42.380
world and the metaphysical world
of God,

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.748
but that he leaves it ambiguous
because it can always be

00:50:46.748 --> 00:50:51.833
misinterpreted and the aesthetic
can always lead you back down to

00:50:51.833 --> 00:50:53.900
the terrestrial realm.

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.750
Does that make sense?

00:51:03.239 --> 00:51:05.990
Student:
Why do you think it's--or what

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:09.842
do you think is the significance
of the fact that the biological

00:51:09.842 --> 00:51:14.200
discussion of inspiration of God
breathing the soul into the

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.600
infant?

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.000
The fact that it's handled by
Statius and that Dante really

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
highlights that by saying--he
has Statius say,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.600
if it's Virgil's will that he
explains but can't refuse

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:30.000
it--what's the significance that
says, I want Statius to handle

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000
this at his discretion?

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.200
Because at other times I think
Virgil, even though he's not

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.800
permitted to know God or to go
to heaven, can still speak about

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.300
divine workings.

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.800
So I don't think it's out of--I
mean for me it's not out of

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.200
Virgil's capacity but I just
couldn't understand why he has

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.000
Statius explain it..

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.700
Prof: Okay,
well I guess if the question

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.190
really had been about what is
the nature of the soul,

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:56.969
what is Aristotle saying in the
De Anima about--

00:51:56.969 --> 00:52:00.849
maybe Virgil could have told
him about that,

00:52:00.849 --> 00:52:04.289
but the actual question is what
is the nature--

00:52:04.289 --> 00:52:06.800
how does the soul live in the
afterlife?

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.090
That is an entirely Christian
question,

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:10.829
that's based on Christian
theology,

00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:17.400
so I think the fact that Virgil
defers to Statius there is

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.659
showing--
is connected with the fact that

00:52:20.659 --> 00:52:24.572
the question is actually about
the afterlife and the afterlife

00:52:24.572 --> 00:52:27.780
is specifically a Christian
context that Statius is

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.219
permitted to know and not
Virgil.

00:52:30.219 --> 00:52:31.150
Does that make sense?

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:31.574
Student:
Yeah..

00:52:31.574 --> 00:52:32.000
Prof: Okay.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.246
Student:
Like I said,

00:52:33.246 --> 00:52:35.509
it is beyond his realm,
beyond Virgil's capacity..

00:52:35.509 --> 00:52:38.003
Prof: Technically,
but the fact that he actually

00:52:38.003 --> 00:52:40.431
asked Virgil first--
I don't know,

00:52:40.431 --> 00:52:44.889
maybe he's saying that it's
actually Aristotle,

00:52:44.889 --> 00:52:48.099
this idea of the immortality of
the soul and the after--

00:52:48.099 --> 00:52:52.340
it's actually there and perhaps
Virgil could answer it,

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:55.963
but then Virgil defers to
Statius because it's a

00:52:55.963 --> 00:52:59.510
theological question that he's
not privy to.

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.949
Does that--okay.

00:53:05.539 --> 00:53:07.670
We're going to end a little bit
early;

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:10.340
I hope that's okay,
so I can go change gears here.

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:14.762
All right, thank you for your
attention and for putting up

00:53:14.762 --> 00:53:15.539
with me.

00:53:15.539 --> 00:53:19.019
All right, thank you.

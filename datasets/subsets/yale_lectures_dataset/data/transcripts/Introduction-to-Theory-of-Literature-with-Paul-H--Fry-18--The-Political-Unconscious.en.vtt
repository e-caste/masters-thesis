00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.885
Prof: Well,
I'd like to begin by pointing

00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:10.472
out that the first name of
Fredric Jameson is spelled

00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:12.060
F-r-e-d-r-i-c.
 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.842
The reason I point that out is
that most scholars don't seem to

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:21.780
be able to grasp that simple
fact and that references to him,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.720
which are rife in the critical
literature,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.190
perhaps one-third of the time
spell his first name wrong.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.688
So I thought it would be
important for you to be among

00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:36.846
the cognoscenti and to know that
it is spelled in the way that I

00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:38.100
just mentioned.
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.980
It's a strange thing.
 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.600
When I started teaching I
taught many,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.730
many, many sections of English
129,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.150
and of course in the first
semester,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.080
the first text that we read was
The Iliad.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.510
Now "Iliad"
is spelled I-l-i-a-d.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.539
Why it is that of the student
population I taught over all

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.344
those years,
hundreds and hundreds of

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:06.852
students, fully a third of them
spelled it I-l-l-i-a-d I really

00:01:06.852 --> 00:01:09.676
couldn't say,
but there are words that simply

00:01:09.676 --> 00:01:12.439
seem to be insusceptible to
being spelled correctly,

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.120
&gt;
 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.019
and one of those words is the
first name of Fredric Jameson,

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:20.920
so stand advised.
 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.402
Okay.
 

00:01:21.402 --> 00:01:26.712
Now last time I talked about
four possible options of an

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:32.506
aesthetic nature for a
Marxist approach to literature,

00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:35.500
and passed them in review.
 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.941
I mentioned realism,
both realism according to the

00:01:39.941 --> 00:01:44.202
tastes and theoretical
preferences of Engels and

00:01:44.202 --> 00:01:48.355
Lukacs,
and also tendentious realism as

00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:54.900
it pervaded the Soviet world,
especially after 1934;

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.553
then also the participatory
aesthetic of figures like Walter

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:02.262
Benjamin,
and the high Modernist

00:02:02.262 --> 00:02:04.906
aesthetic of the
"whole"

00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:07.790
embraced particularly by
Adorno--

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.366
those last are the two
aesthetic modes that we passed

00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:13.775
in review last time--
and finally,

00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:16.872
as a fifth notion,
the idea that realism being

00:02:16.872 --> 00:02:20.455
somehow outworn,
having developed hardening of

00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:25.169
the arteries as a kind of a
bourgeois perspective on things,

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:30.276
needs somehow or another to be
replaced aesthetically in the

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:34.000
Marxist view of things by
something else.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.490
Perhaps the most eloquent
proponent of replacing it with

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.507
something is Jameson,
who earlier in the introductory

00:02:42.507 --> 00:02:45.560
chapter of The Political
Unconscious--

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.508
much of which you've been
assigned for today--

00:02:48.508 --> 00:02:54.366
writes a section which he calls
"Magical Narratives"

00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:58.694
and which promotes,
very much in keeping with the

00:02:58.694 --> 00:03:03.658
thinking of Northrop Frye about
the role of romance in society--

00:03:03.658 --> 00:03:08.210
and particularly the religious
role of romance in society--

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.699
proposes that an aesthetic of
the romance which entails

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.169
folklore,
the folk tale,

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.741
the fairy tale,
and various forms of folk

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:24.294
expression as a magical
resolution of conflicts that

00:03:24.294 --> 00:03:29.645
can't otherwise be resolved,
is the more appropriate

00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:31.860
aesthetic to take up.
 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.419
The long passage that I sent to
you last night,

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:41.218
which I'd like quickly to go
over, is meant to further the

00:03:41.218 --> 00:03:47.425
promotion of this aesthetic and
also to pose for us a critique

00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:53.531
of what the consequences would
be of lingering with a realist

00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:55.160
aesthetic.
 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.285
So Jameson says,
on the second passage on your

00:03:58.285 --> 00:04:00.825
sheet:
Let Scott, Balzac and Dreiser

00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:04.989
serve as the [and remember that
Balzac is the favorite author of

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.155
Engels;
Scott is the favorite author,

00:04:08.155 --> 00:04:10.658
at least in 1927,
of Lukacs;

00:04:10.658 --> 00:04:14.518
and Dreiser is a figure from
the so-called naturalist

00:04:14.518 --> 00:04:18.673
movement, the American novelist
who is a very appropriate

00:04:18.673 --> 00:04:20.528
addition to the list.
 

00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:25.341
It's in that context that
Jameson is dropping these

00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:29.670
particular names]
non-chronological markers of

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.290
the emergence of realism in its
modern form.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.464
These first great realisms are
characterized by a fundamental

00:04:38.464 --> 00:04:42.430
and exhilarating heterogeneity
in their raw materials,

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.029
and by a corresponding
versatility in their narrative

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.860
apparatus.
 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.425
At such moments a generic
confinement to the existent [in

00:04:50.425 --> 00:04:53.658
other words,
the only thing you have to do

00:04:53.658 --> 00:04:58.297
if you're a realist is talk
about things the way they really

00:04:58.297 --> 00:05:00.970
are]
has a paradoxically liberating

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.370
effect on the registers of the
text and releases a set of

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.279
heterogeneous historical
perspectives:

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:12.055
the past for Scott,
the future for Balzac,

00:05:12.055 --> 00:05:15.389
and the process of
commodification for Dreiser--

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.930
normally felt to be
inconsistent with a focus on the

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.389
historical present.
 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.091
In other words,
in Scott's treatment of history

00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:27.182
as dialectical,
against the foil of the present

00:05:27.182 --> 00:05:32.663
there is envisioned a kind of
romanticized evocation of a

00:05:32.663 --> 00:05:35.809
feudal past,
and so it is in turn--I don't

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:38.750
want to linger long over this
with the other writers.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.112
Indeed, this multiple
temporality tends to be sealed

00:05:44.112 --> 00:05:50.422
off and re-contained again in
high realism and naturalism [in

00:05:50.422 --> 00:05:54.216
other words,
it starts getting too easy,

00:05:54.216 --> 00:05:57.711
and the formulas of
representing and evoking the

00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:01.319
real begin to become,
as I said, sclerotic.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.259
They begin to harden.
 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.408
They begin to confine us in
ways that had hitherto been

00:06:07.408 --> 00:06:10.326
liberating]
where a perfected narrative

00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:13.380
apparatus,
in particular the threefold

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.550
imperatives of authorial
depersonalization--

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.024
that is to say,
the voice in style indirect

00:06:19.024 --> 00:06:25.160
libre,
authorial depersonalization;

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.795
unity of point of view,
and restriction to scenic

00:06:28.795 --> 00:06:33.113
representation begin to confer
on the realistic option the

00:06:33.113 --> 00:06:37.279
appearance of an asphyxiating
self-imposed penance.

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.444
In other words,
"this is all I can say and

00:06:39.444 --> 00:06:41.139
this is the only way I can say
it.

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:45.255
There are no other
possibilities of literary

00:06:45.255 --> 00:06:50.999
expression because I now feel
confined to this reification of

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:55.007
the real,
this insistence that the real,

00:06:55.007 --> 00:06:59.603
the evocation of the real,
is my only literary option,

00:06:59.603 --> 00:07:02.720
and so it's no longer
liberating."

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.127
It is in the context of this
gradual reification in late

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:12.017
capitalism that the romance once
again comes to be felt as the

00:07:12.017 --> 00:07:16.827
place of narrative heterogeneity
and freedom from the reality

00:07:16.827 --> 00:07:18.110
principle.
 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.079
That is,
in a way, a jab at Freud,

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:26.312
but at the same time an
acknowledgement that Freud

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:30.543
participates in a sort of
growing despair over the

00:07:30.543 --> 00:07:34.690
necessity of confining oneself
to the real,

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.584
evoking freedom from the
reality principle to which a now

00:07:38.584 --> 00:07:42.269
oppressive realistic
representation is the hostage.

00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:42.766
Okay.
 

00:07:42.766 --> 00:07:47.250
So that's the aesthetic of
Fredric Jameson,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.360
and before we begin an
analysis--that is to say,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.730
before we begin to consider his
three horizons or concentric

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.500
circles of interpretation--
from other points of view,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.303
I thought it would be
interesting to find this

00:08:01.303 --> 00:08:04.420
romance aesthetic in
those three levels.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.278
We're talking,
of course, about the

00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:08.738
"political,"
the "social,"

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:11.910
and the "historical":
the political,

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.910
the kind of chronicle-like--as
he puts it--

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:21.930
record of successive happenings
in a fictive context,

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:28.180
constructed as a plot by some
individual voice;

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:34.384
the social as the
conflict--or emergence into our

00:08:34.384 --> 00:08:38.558
awareness of its being a
conflict--

00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:41.788
of what Jameson calls
"ideologemes"--

00:08:41.788 --> 00:08:45.293
that is to say,
ways of thinking about the

00:08:45.293 --> 00:08:50.250
world as expressed by disparate
and conflicting classes;

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.488
and then finally the
historical,

00:08:52.488 --> 00:08:55.080
which Jameson calls
"necessity."

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.029
At the end of the essay,
he says it's "what

00:08:58.029 --> 00:09:01.168
hurts," but in terms of
literary analysis,

00:09:01.168 --> 00:09:05.897
as we'll see,
it has to do with understanding

00:09:05.897 --> 00:09:12.235
the overlap of the succession of
modes of production as they

00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:15.460
unfold in historical time.
 

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.600
We'll have more to say about
modes of production,

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.710
but our basic three horizons,
then--

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.629
in which I am now going to look
for the romance aesthetic--

00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:29.270
our basic three horizons,
then, are what Jameson calls

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.558
the political,
the social and the historical.

00:09:32.558 --> 00:09:35.269
It's important that he does
sometimes call them

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:39.235
concentric circles,
because you have to understand

00:09:39.235 --> 00:09:42.769
that as you advance through the
three stages,

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:45.500
you're not leaving anything
behind.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:52.966
The political is contained
within the social and the social

00:09:52.966 --> 00:09:57.730
is contained within the
historical.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:04.485
All of that is what is not to
be left behind but is rather to

00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:07.750
be rethought,
reconsidered.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.716
Jameson sometimes uses the word
"rewritten,"

00:10:11.716 --> 00:10:16.206
thinking of the text that is
the object of one's study as one

00:10:16.206 --> 00:10:19.200
advances through these three
stages.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.791
So that's why he thinks it
appropriate to call them

00:10:22.791 --> 00:10:24.298
concentric circles.
 

00:10:24.298 --> 00:10:31.506
So what is the essential
political moment of the

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.509
creative act?
 

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:36.678
Well, it's what Jameson,
borrowing from Kenneth Burke,

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:38.889
calls "the symbolic
act."

00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:44.351
As an individual writer,
I undertake to resolve

00:10:44.351 --> 00:10:49.788
symbolically a contradiction--
and Marxism is always about

00:10:49.788 --> 00:10:51.730
contradiction:
that is to say,

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:56.803
the way in which the
perspective of any class exists

00:10:56.803 --> 00:11:02.972
in a contradictory relation both
with its own needs and desires

00:11:02.972 --> 00:11:05.658
and with other classes.
 

00:11:05.658 --> 00:11:08.932
In any case,
then, the symbolic act at the

00:11:08.932 --> 00:11:13.565
political level is designed to
resolve a contradiction that

00:11:13.565 --> 00:11:16.519
can't be resolved by other
means.

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:19.070
In other words,
it's a fantasy,

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:23.065
it is the fairy tale,
it is the princess and the

00:11:23.065 --> 00:11:24.000
pauper.
 

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.950
It is the arbitrary happy
ending tacked onto a situation

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:33.808
for which in reality there would
be no happy ending.

00:11:33.808 --> 00:11:37.437
In other words,
it is a romance perspective

00:11:37.437 --> 00:11:42.029
about the world,
the realistic approach to which

00:11:42.029 --> 00:11:47.928
would somehow or another leave
us feeling much more confined.

00:11:47.928 --> 00:11:53.658
"Slumdog Millionaire"
is an interesting example.

00:11:53.658 --> 00:11:56.428
It's an auteur film made by
Danny Boyle,

00:11:56.428 --> 00:12:01.259
an interesting example of an
individual act which magically

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:06.341
resolves a contradiction through
the whole Bollywood apparatus

00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:09.090
that it brings to bear on it.
 

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.003
The contradictions,
of course, are rife between

00:12:12.003 --> 00:12:14.938
Hindu and Muslim,
the contradictions entailed in

00:12:14.938 --> 00:12:17.067
globalization,
the contradictions of

00:12:17.067 --> 00:12:19.250
caste--all of these
contradictions,

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.440
not to be resolved on a
realistic plane,

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.476
nevertheless can be resolved by
an individual symbolic act:

00:12:27.476 --> 00:12:28.870
You hit the Lotto.
 

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:34.977
You win against all odds a
prize that makes you a

00:12:34.977 --> 00:12:36.759
millionaire.
 

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:38.298
Who wants to be a millionaire?
 

00:12:38.298 --> 00:12:39.490
Well, we all
&gt;

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.048
want to be millionaires,
but only one of us

00:12:43.048 --> 00:12:46.691
miraculously,
magically, through a series of

00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:49.740
completely implausible
happenstances,

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.690
is able to do so.
 

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:56.024
Now notice this:
it's not that it doesn't

00:12:56.024 --> 00:12:57.000
happen.
 

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.850
People do hit the Lotto.
 

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:03.360
People do win the $64,000
question or whatever it is.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.350
It's not that it's absolute
never-never land,

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.033
but the point is--and I think
this is really ultimately the

00:13:11.033 --> 00:13:14.905
point of that extravagant dance
in the railroad station at the

00:13:14.905 --> 00:13:19.902
end of the film--
the point is that even were it

00:13:19.902 --> 00:13:23.893
to happen in reality,
it wouldn't resolve

00:13:23.893 --> 00:13:24.889
contradictions.
 

00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:27.984
That is to say,
your life would not have that

00:13:27.984 --> 00:13:31.428
kind of scripted perfection:
You get the girl,

00:13:31.428 --> 00:13:34.836
everything is going to be
perfect, and the whole world

00:13:34.836 --> 00:13:37.840
falls in line,
dancing behind you.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.279
This just
&gt;

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:42.070
doesn't happen.
 

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.875
In other words,
it can be sort of tragic to hit

00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:51.168
the Lotto, as many stories of
that kind have made clear to us.

00:13:51.168 --> 00:13:54.956
That, it seems to me,
is finally how the film is

00:13:54.956 --> 00:13:59.870
somewhat self-conscious about
its nature as a symbolic act.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.854
Anyway, that's the romance
element of the political level

00:14:04.854 --> 00:14:08.860
of interpretation as understood
by Jameson.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:14.572
Now the second level brings to
the surface the element of

00:14:14.572 --> 00:14:20.384
subversion that has to be
entailed in this same fairy tale

00:14:20.384 --> 00:14:26.710
resolution of a conflict that
can't otherwise be resolved.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.000
There are all sorts of other
aspects at the second level,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.464
but remember I'm discovering
the romance aesthetic here in

00:14:34.464 --> 00:14:39.163
all three levels before turning
to other matters having to do

00:14:39.163 --> 00:14:40.259
with them.
 

00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:43.529
At the second level,
on page 1297,

00:14:43.529 --> 00:14:47.890
the right-hand column,
you have Ernst Bloch's

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.460
understanding of the fairy tale.
 

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.900
This is at the second level,
about two thirds of the way

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.340
down.
 

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.894
Thus, for instance,
Bloch's reading of the fairy

00:14:57.894 --> 00:14:59.351
tale,
with its magical

00:14:59.351 --> 00:15:02.928
wish-fulfillments and its
Utopian fantasies of plenty and

00:15:02.928 --> 00:15:06.524
the pays de Cocagne,
restores the dialogical

00:15:06.524 --> 00:15:09.264
["The Big Rock Candy
Mountain"

00:15:09.264 --> 00:15:12.495
basically is the pays
de Cocagne]

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:15.868
and antagonistic content of
this "form"

00:15:15.868 --> 00:15:19.380
by exhibiting it as a
systematic deconstruction and

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:23.033
undermining of the hegemonic
aristocratic form of the

00:15:23.033 --> 00:15:25.865
epic…
In other words,

00:15:25.865 --> 00:15:29.379
it's not just a symbolic act,
the fairy tale.

00:15:29.379 --> 00:15:33.899
It is a thumbing of the nose at
hegemony.

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:38.538
It is, in other words,
an act of antagonism which,

00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:44.089
of course, recognizes the
impossibility of resolution or

00:15:44.089 --> 00:15:49.840
reconciliation precisely in its
register of antagonism;

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.658
so that at the second level,
the social level,

00:15:52.658 --> 00:15:57.220
in which the ideological voices
of various classes and

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.490
perspective are openly in
conflict,

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.570
you don't get resolution.
 

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:06.399
What you get is subversion and
reaction.

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:11.552
You get, in other words,
a tension of voices that is not

00:16:11.552 --> 00:16:17.172
meant to resolve anything but is
rather meant to lay bare the

00:16:17.172 --> 00:16:20.168
conflicts that are entailed.
 

00:16:20.168 --> 00:16:25.144
Still, however,
in doing this you get the kind

00:16:25.144 --> 00:16:31.774
of carnivalesque uprising from
below which Jameson associates

00:16:31.774 --> 00:16:36.750
with romance:
that letting off of steam,

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:42.458
that entertaining of the
possibility of utopia that you

00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:44.421
get,
for example,

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:50.224
in the early modern period on
that day in which someone is

00:16:50.224 --> 00:16:56.428
called the Lord of Misrule,
the entire social order for one

00:16:56.428 --> 00:17:00.667
day is inverted,
the low are elevated to

00:17:00.667 --> 00:17:05.597
positions of authority,
and for one day you get the

00:17:05.597 --> 00:17:08.180
keys to the castle,
in effect.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.880
This is a day in which conflict
is expressed and not resolved

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.346
because everybody knows that
tomorrow it's going to be the

00:17:17.346 --> 00:17:21.420
same old-same old and back to
business as usual;

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.058
but there is still the romance
element,

00:17:24.058 --> 00:17:32.806
the idea that folk expression
is simultaneously the expression

00:17:32.806 --> 00:17:36.612
of a wish,
a wish similar to the wish

00:17:36.612 --> 00:17:40.497
that's expressed at the first
political level but the

00:17:40.497 --> 00:17:43.858
expression of a wish which is
collective--

00:17:43.858 --> 00:17:46.282
that is to say,
in behalf of a class and a

00:17:46.282 --> 00:17:48.336
perspective,
and which is also,

00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:52.896
with great self-consciousness,
not a wish that can in any way

00:17:52.896 --> 00:17:58.510
expect to be fulfilled,
but rather one that is used

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:05.987
subversively with respect to the
dominant ideology that it

00:18:05.987 --> 00:18:10.838
expresses its abrasiveness
toward.

00:18:10.838 --> 00:18:15.715
The third level involves the
way in which there is at any

00:18:15.715 --> 00:18:20.242
given time at the historical
level a dominant mode of

00:18:20.242 --> 00:18:21.548
production.
 

00:18:21.548 --> 00:18:28.016
A mode of production is a
system of thought or production

00:18:28.016 --> 00:18:35.058
generated by an overarching
social or economic arrangement.

00:18:35.058 --> 00:18:39.175
Jameson lists them in his text,
and we'll come back to them and

00:18:39.175 --> 00:18:43.160
we'll read that listing and
we'll think about those terms;

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:49.098
but Jameson gives an excellent
example of the way in which,

00:18:49.098 --> 00:18:51.308
in the latter part of the
eighteenth century,

00:18:51.308 --> 00:18:57.214
the Enlightenment began to be
the dominant form of expression

00:18:57.214 --> 00:19:02.356
of an emergent mercantile,
successfully capitalist

00:19:02.356 --> 00:19:03.650
bourgeoisie.
 

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.462
That is to say,
the values that drove the

00:19:07.462 --> 00:19:13.278
development of industrialization
and capital were those values

00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:18.332
emerging from feudal and
aristocratic ideals that were

00:19:18.332 --> 00:19:22.445
less realistic,
less engaged with actuality and

00:19:22.445 --> 00:19:26.023
the way in which you can
actually get things done in the

00:19:26.023 --> 00:19:26.608
world.
 

00:19:26.608 --> 00:19:32.595
The Enlightenment is understood
as an expression of an emerging

00:19:32.595 --> 00:19:37.518
new mode of production,
or capitalism as it succeeds

00:19:37.518 --> 00:19:38.868
feudalism.
 

00:19:38.868 --> 00:19:42.808
But Jameson points out--and
here's where romance comes in,

00:19:42.808 --> 00:19:45.759
and then after that we'll move
on to our next point--

00:19:45.759 --> 00:19:50.740
that at the same time you get
Enlightenment,

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.614
at the same time that that does
seem to become the dominant form

00:19:54.614 --> 00:19:58.715
of expression,
you also get two modes of

00:19:58.715 --> 00:20:02.140
resistance or contestation.
 

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.500
On the one hand you have
Romanticism,

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.596
which can be understood in this
context as a kind of atavistic

00:20:09.596 --> 00:20:13.690
throwback to aristocratic and
feudal idealism,

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:18.471
codes of conduct,
beliefs, visions of utopia

00:20:18.471 --> 00:20:23.588
within Romanticism--
all of them sort of trying to

00:20:23.588 --> 00:20:28.101
recode in an age of
Enlightenment various sorts of

00:20:28.101 --> 00:20:32.058
idealism that had come to seem
outmoded.

00:20:32.058 --> 00:20:36.180
So that's a kind of,
as it were, reactionary mode of

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.945
production overlapping with or
expressing itself through the

00:20:40.945 --> 00:20:42.318
dominant one.
 

00:20:42.318 --> 00:20:46.188
Then at the same time,
you get folk resistance

00:20:46.188 --> 00:20:50.279
to the increasing mechanization
of the Enlightenment.

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:54.357
With Political Economy,
with the rise of social

00:20:54.357 --> 00:20:59.678
engineering and with the various
forms of social organization

00:20:59.678 --> 00:21:05.700
associated with Utilitarianism,
you get folk resistance.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.769
You get popular resistance in
the forms of protest,

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:15.288
"frame-breaking,"
disruption of labor activity,

00:21:15.288 --> 00:21:17.898
protest against
industrialization,

00:21:17.898 --> 00:21:22.247
all of which also--
because it insists on earlier

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:27.251
forms of agricultural and
industrial cottage industries

00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:29.933
and so on--
is atavistic,

00:21:29.933 --> 00:21:36.001
also a throwback to the way in
which labor is performed or

00:21:36.001 --> 00:21:39.088
conducted under feudalism.
 

00:21:39.088 --> 00:21:43.040
So that, too,
in the form of folk

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.269
expression--
of longing for,

00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:49.368
in this case,
a utopian past,

00:21:49.368 --> 00:21:54.201
more agrarian,
more individualized as a mode

00:21:54.201 --> 00:21:58.229
of labor,
and more cottage-oriented--in

00:21:58.229 --> 00:22:03.308
all of this you get an
overlapping mode of production.

00:22:03.308 --> 00:22:06.308
So the tension among modes of
production,

00:22:06.308 --> 00:22:10.548
which is the focus of analysis
at the historical level,

00:22:10.548 --> 00:22:15.195
the third historical level,
can also be understood in terms

00:22:15.195 --> 00:22:18.240
of the romance of utopian
nostalgia.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.500
All right.
 

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.942
So that,
then, just to show how

00:22:21.942 --> 00:22:25.365
Jameson's aesthetic,
his sense of the importance of

00:22:25.365 --> 00:22:28.806
romance,
can be seen to pervade the way

00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:34.700
in which he understands analysis
at all three of these levels.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.940
So that's his aesthetic.
 

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.391
The question then is:
what is the

00:22:39.391 --> 00:22:44.217
interpretative payoff of
undertaking literary analysis at

00:22:44.217 --> 00:22:45.980
these three levels?
 

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.096
That is to say,
why should we take the trouble

00:22:49.096 --> 00:22:49.859
to do it?
 

00:22:49.859 --> 00:22:51.848
What's so interesting about it?
 

00:22:51.848 --> 00:22:53.538
Well, from Jameson's point of
view--

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:56.368
this, of course,
is the title of his book--

00:22:56.368 --> 00:23:01.623
each of these three modes of
analysis is designed to

00:23:01.623 --> 00:23:05.295
disclose,
to uncover, to lay bare an

00:23:05.295 --> 00:23:09.980
element of the "political
unconscious."

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:14.618
As for deconstruction,
as for Freud,

00:23:14.618 --> 00:23:19.460
this sense of a political
unconscious exposes or reveals

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.740
something that is antithetical
to ordinary consciousness--

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.646
that is to say,
undermines our conventional

00:23:28.646 --> 00:23:33.263
understanding of things,
shows us that beneath our

00:23:33.263 --> 00:23:38.396
conventional understanding of
things there are laws and causes

00:23:38.396 --> 00:23:42.690
and dynamics at work that we
need to understand.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.596
In this case,
however, the unconscious in

00:23:45.596 --> 00:23:48.720
question is not a linguistic
unconscious;

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.460
it is not a psychological
unconscious.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.529
It is a political unconscious.
 

00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:58.328
Insofar, in other words,
as we are political animals,

00:23:58.328 --> 00:24:02.946
the acts that we perform,
the dialogues that we engage

00:24:02.946 --> 00:24:05.807
in,
the modes of production that we

00:24:05.807 --> 00:24:09.175
participate in--
all of them have political

00:24:09.175 --> 00:24:11.509
ramifications;
that is to say,

00:24:11.509 --> 00:24:14.671
we do what we do,
as opposed to doing other

00:24:14.671 --> 00:24:18.246
things,
for political reasons of which

00:24:18.246 --> 00:24:23.777
we may not be fully aware--
hence the emphasis in analysis

00:24:23.777 --> 00:24:28.029
of this kind on the political
unconscious.

00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:30.150
So again the three levels.
 

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.428
Going back to the idea of the
"symbolic"

00:24:34.428 --> 00:24:38.530
act: what political
unconscious, in other words,

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.500
is revealed by a symbolic act?
 

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.152
Well, Jameson gives a wonderful
example taken from

00:24:45.152 --> 00:24:48.665
structuralism,
and you can see that he leans

00:24:48.665 --> 00:24:53.392
very heavily on structuralism
for his understanding of the way

00:24:53.392 --> 00:24:58.117
in which something is going on
in a narrative form of which it

00:24:58.117 --> 00:25:02.690
is not immediately apparent that
anybody can be aware.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:07.618
Take for example Caduveo face
painting.

00:25:07.618 --> 00:25:11.895
Levi-Strauss asks both in
The Savage Mind and again

00:25:11.895 --> 00:25:16.624
in Tristes Tropiques:
why the excessive complexity

00:25:16.624 --> 00:25:18.348
of these paintings?
 

00:25:18.348 --> 00:25:24.576
Why the curious tension in the
marks on the faces between the

00:25:24.576 --> 00:25:27.690
vertical and the horizontal?
 

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:32.101
Why, in other words,
do you get a feeling of

00:25:32.101 --> 00:25:35.987
tension,
of aesthetic beauty but also of

00:25:35.987 --> 00:25:40.339
tension and complication,
in this cross-hatching,

00:25:40.339 --> 00:25:45.172
in this sense of the relation
between the vertical and the

00:25:45.172 --> 00:25:46.358
horizontal?
 

00:25:46.358 --> 00:25:48.623
So Jameson's argument,
which he brings out more

00:25:48.623 --> 00:25:51.637
clearly than Levi-Strauss--
but Levi-Strauss does say the

00:25:51.637 --> 00:25:54.630
same thing,
contrasting the Caduveo in this

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.308
respect with neighboring tribes
like the Bororo--

00:25:58.308 --> 00:26:03.303
his explanation is that the
Caduveo are a hierarchical

00:26:03.303 --> 00:26:09.144
society in which there are open
and obvious forms of inequality

00:26:09.144 --> 00:26:15.269
that one must perforce be aware
of as a member of the tribe,

00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:19.316
but that neighboring tribes,
(and this is something that

00:26:19.316 --> 00:26:23.362
probably the tribe itself can
observe) work out a way of

00:26:23.362 --> 00:26:27.409
seeming to resolve the
contradictions inherent in

00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:30.720
hierarchy by the exchange of
moieties,

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.295
which is to say,
of kinship gifts and wedding

00:26:34.295 --> 00:26:39.519
gifts and so on--
that Levi-Strauss talks about.

00:26:39.519 --> 00:26:45.190
This exchange of moieties seems
to impose on these social orders

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:48.142
in real life,
in real terms,

00:26:48.142 --> 00:26:54.300
a way of making society more
equal than it might otherwise

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:54.950
be.
 

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:58.336
Yes, it's still hierarchical,
but at the same time,

00:26:58.336 --> 00:27:01.924
wealth is distributed,
each person has his own form of

00:27:01.924 --> 00:27:04.160
asserting dignity,
and so on.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.950
The Caduveo doesn't have this.
 

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:10.436
Levi-Strauss's and Jameson's
point is that the Caduveo never

00:27:10.436 --> 00:27:14.469
really worked that out,
so they're stuck with a simple

00:27:14.469 --> 00:27:17.358
form of hierarchical
organization.

00:27:17.358 --> 00:27:20.265
Face painting,
then, according to Levi-Strauss

00:27:20.265 --> 00:27:24.601
followed by Jameson,
is their way of symbolically

00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:30.098
resolving the problem by
introducing the horizontal--

00:27:30.098 --> 00:27:33.048
by introducing,
in other words,

00:27:33.048 --> 00:27:38.355
the ways in which other tribes
have successfully offset

00:27:38.355 --> 00:27:43.662
hierarchy with ways of
distributing wealth and prestige

00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:45.529
more equally.
 

00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:49.753
The symbolic act which other
tribes were able to accomplish

00:27:49.753 --> 00:27:52.628
in real life,
in real terms,

00:27:52.628 --> 00:27:57.269
the Caduveo accomplish
individually,

00:27:57.269 --> 00:28:01.749
with each individual woman
painting her face as a symbolic

00:28:01.749 --> 00:28:04.576
act,
a symbolic act expressing the

00:28:04.576 --> 00:28:07.964
political unconscious--
because this is not an act,

00:28:07.964 --> 00:28:11.053
we suppose,
of which any individual is

00:28:11.053 --> 00:28:11.690
aware.
 

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:15.185
The unawareness,
the lack of consciousness of

00:28:15.185 --> 00:28:19.352
what's going on in a story,
is much more readily available

00:28:19.352 --> 00:28:22.798
to us in the Oedipus myth
because that's the part of

00:28:22.798 --> 00:28:25.769
Levi-Strauss's "Structural
Study of Myth"

00:28:25.769 --> 00:28:27.730
that we happen to have read.
 

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.078
The next part is
&gt;

00:28:29.078 --> 00:28:31.692
Caduveo face painting,
but in "The Structural

00:28:31.692 --> 00:28:34.358
Study of Myth,"
Levi-Strauss begins by talking

00:28:34.358 --> 00:28:35.798
about the Oedipus myth.
 

00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:38.627
Well, the whole point of that
is, "Gee,

00:28:38.627 --> 00:28:40.732
there's a terrible
contradiction,

00:28:40.732 --> 00:28:43.430
born from two or born from
one."

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:46.690
Plainly, no individual version
of the story,

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:50.058
certainly not Sophocles'
version, is saying to itself,

00:28:50.058 --> 00:28:52.019
"Oh, this is a terrible
contradiction.

00:28:52.019 --> 00:28:54.675
I don't know whether I'm born
from two people or born from one

00:28:54.675 --> 00:28:55.328
person."
 

00:28:55.328 --> 00:28:58.259
That is the unconscious,
in other words,

00:28:58.259 --> 00:29:02.542
of the story which is brought
out, brought to the surface,

00:29:02.542 --> 00:29:05.848
by a structuralist analysis of
the myth.

00:29:05.848 --> 00:29:10.153
Jameson doesn't talk about it
because it's not in any obvious

00:29:10.153 --> 00:29:14.528
and immediate way a political
problem or a problem susceptible

00:29:14.528 --> 00:29:16.250
of Marxist analysis.
 

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.410
It is perhaps
ultimately--everything is--

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.922
but not immediately,
and so he turns instead to a

00:29:21.922 --> 00:29:26.575
discussion of the Caduveo myth,
which has as its unconscious an

00:29:26.575 --> 00:29:29.440
issue that's obviously a
political one,

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:36.268
but it is nevertheless the case
that a structural analysis of a

00:29:36.268 --> 00:29:42.434
symbolic act is designed to and
will inevitably reveal an

00:29:42.434 --> 00:29:48.880
element of unconscious thought,
political or otherwise.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.759
That then is the way in which
the political unconscious,

00:29:51.759 --> 00:29:55.095
as Jameson describes it,
is brought out at the first

00:29:55.095 --> 00:29:57.450
political level of
understanding,

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.390
the individual symbolic act.
 

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.269
Now at the second level,
the social,

00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:05.730
in which the text,
as Jameson says,

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:10.430
rewrites itself not as an
individual act but as,

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:13.220
very much in the spirit of
Bakhtin,

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.538
a heteroglossal expression of
voices,

00:30:17.538 --> 00:30:21.895
of points of view,
writing themselves as it were

00:30:21.895 --> 00:30:26.438
through the text--
there the political unconscious

00:30:26.438 --> 00:30:31.729
in question is something that
has to be understood in terms of

00:30:31.729 --> 00:30:33.029
ideologemes.
 

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:37.759
In other words,
people reflexively express,

00:30:37.759 --> 00:30:41.640
perhaps unbeknownst to
themselves, views and opinions

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.071
which are intelligible not
arising out of their

00:30:45.071 --> 00:30:48.029
individuality,
not because they are who they

00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:49.940
are, as they themselves might
say--

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:55.253
but rather because of their
economic class and prestige

00:30:55.253 --> 00:30:56.140
status.
 

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.053
In other words,
because of their place in the

00:30:59.053 --> 00:31:02.630
world, it follows that they will
hold certain views.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:06.209
They will be the mouthpieces,
in other words,

00:31:06.209 --> 00:31:10.520
for certain ideologemes,
and those ideologemes Jameson

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.670
understands to be at least in
part unconscious.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.277
One doesn't know,
in other words,

00:31:17.277 --> 00:31:21.352
that the opinions one so
fervently expresses and so

00:31:21.352 --> 00:31:25.508
devoutly believes in are
opinions conditioned by the

00:31:25.508 --> 00:31:29.990
social circumstances in which
one finds oneself,

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:33.854
so that literature then
becomes a kind of drama of

00:31:33.854 --> 00:31:38.575
ideologemes,
a representation of unresolved

00:31:38.575 --> 00:31:45.454
conflict that manifests in the
variety of class or status

00:31:45.454 --> 00:31:48.650
voices brought to bear.
 

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:53.175
You can see this is the point
at which Jameson's work is

00:31:53.175 --> 00:31:57.866
closest to Bakhtin's and most
clearly reflects some of the

00:31:57.866 --> 00:32:03.298
preoccupations of Bakhtin as we
have encountered them already.

00:32:03.298 --> 00:32:06.202
Jameson gives a very good
example of the way in which this

00:32:06.202 --> 00:32:10.481
conflict works--
because part of the mystery of

00:32:10.481 --> 00:32:16.983
these clashes is that they
always present themselves within

00:32:16.983 --> 00:32:18.890
a shared code.
 

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:21.663
This already begins to look
forward to the idea of the mode

00:32:21.663 --> 00:32:22.430
of production.
 

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:27.248
At the bottom of page 1296,
Jameson is talking about the

00:32:27.248 --> 00:32:32.505
violent religious controversies
of the seventeenth century in

00:32:32.505 --> 00:32:36.358
England between Cavalier and
Roundhead,

00:32:36.358 --> 00:32:42.404
with all the controversies
surrounding the interregnum of

00:32:42.404 --> 00:32:45.630
Cromwell,
the restoration of Charles the

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.511
Second,
and the tremendous ferment,

00:32:48.511 --> 00:32:54.470
largely religious ferment,
taking place during that period;

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:58.536
but this ferment for any
Marxist--and Christopher Hill is

00:32:58.536 --> 00:33:02.820
the leading historian writing
about this period who has made

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.380
it most clearly intelligible in
these terms--

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:11.461
for any Marxist this conflict
has an underlying political

00:33:11.461 --> 00:33:16.328
unconscious: that is,
its ultimate motives are an

00:33:16.328 --> 00:33:21.710
assertion of rights and an
expression of class views.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.612
This is the way Jameson puts
it, bottom of page 1296:

00:33:24.612 --> 00:33:28.017
"…the normal form
of the dialogical is essentially

00:33:28.017 --> 00:33:30.193
an antagonistic
one…"

00:33:30.193 --> 00:33:34.066
He's alluding here to Bakhtin,
for whom frequently the

00:33:34.066 --> 00:33:38.700
dialogical is simply a kind of
happy cacophony of voices,

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.618
a carnivalesque expression of
chaos from below,

00:33:43.618 --> 00:33:47.250
all of which is a kind of
yeast-like ferment,

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:53.105
and somehow or another in the
long run energizing and socially

00:33:53.105 --> 00:33:54.450
progressive.
 

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:59.844
But Jameson points out that the
ideologeme is very often

00:33:59.844 --> 00:34:04.691
expressive of conflict as well,
an antagonistic one,

00:34:04.691 --> 00:34:09.074
and that the dialogue of class
struggle is one in which two

00:34:09.074 --> 00:34:13.684
opposing discourses fight it out
within the general unity of a

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:14.969
shared code.
 

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:18.427
Thus, for instance,
the shared master code of

00:34:18.427 --> 00:34:23.302
religion becomes in the 1640s in
England the place in which the

00:34:23.302 --> 00:34:27.074
dominant formulations of a
hegemonic theology are

00:34:27.074 --> 00:34:30.768
re-appropriated and polemically
modified.

00:34:30.768 --> 00:34:33.460
In other words,
the Church of England stands

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.588
for--and this is the word that
was used--"esta

00:34:36.588 --> 00:34:37.840
blishment."
 

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.943
Roundhead points of view,
various forms of Puritanism and

00:34:40.943 --> 00:34:43.050
other forms of religious
rebellion,

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:47.483
are antiestablishment,
and yet they are all coded

00:34:47.483 --> 00:34:52.010
within the discourse of the
Christian religion.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.936
That is to say,
they have to fight it out on a

00:34:54.936 --> 00:34:58.057
common battlefield,
and that's the way it is with

00:34:58.057 --> 00:34:59.750
conflict of this kind.
 

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:04.141
Maybe a contemporary example
would be not so much in the

00:35:04.141 --> 00:35:05.820
sphere of religion.
 

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:10.202
Well, today one could
speak again of religion,

00:35:10.202 --> 00:35:14.501
but in the sixties and
seventies it was maybe more a

00:35:14.501 --> 00:35:16.440
question of ethics.
 

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.139
Think, for example,
of the sexual revolution.

00:35:19.139 --> 00:35:24.226
Again there is a common ground,
a sense of the centrality of

00:35:24.226 --> 00:35:30.132
sexual conduct to human life;
but what you get in--not so

00:35:30.132 --> 00:35:33.661
much, perhaps,
the conflict of classes as

00:35:33.661 --> 00:35:36.079
conflict of generations in this
case--

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:40.898
what you get in the conflict of
generations is an inversion of

00:35:40.898 --> 00:35:44.090
values,
not a new set of values exactly

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:47.500
but a simple transvaluation of
what exists.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.483
Everything that one faction
considers bad,

00:35:50.483 --> 00:35:54.050
another faction transvalues and
considers good.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:59.092
The very thing against which
one is warned is the thing that

00:35:59.092 --> 00:36:02.000
one rushes to embrace and so on.
 

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.081
So once again you get a clash,
an unresolved clash,

00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:13.177
but a clash that arises from
and participates in the semiotic

00:36:13.177 --> 00:36:17.039
structure of a common code,
right?

00:36:17.039 --> 00:36:22.679
That's the way in which social
antagonism expresses itself at

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:26.239
the second level,
and it usually involves,

00:36:26.239 --> 00:36:29.110
because there are underlying
interests,

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.465
elements of the political
unconscious and brings to the

00:36:32.465 --> 00:36:35.449
surface elements of the
political unconscious.

00:36:35.449 --> 00:36:40.909
Finally, at the third level
what comes out,

00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:47.344
what is made manifest,
is the tension or clash among

00:36:47.344 --> 00:36:55.039
modes of production as they
jostle each other historically.

00:36:55.039 --> 00:36:59.050
It's understood that the
danger, as Jameson puts it,

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:02.737
of thinking in terms of a
succession of modes of

00:37:02.737 --> 00:37:07.521
production is that each one of
those modes of production might

00:37:07.521 --> 00:37:10.190
seem like a synchronic moment.
 

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.653
In other words,
if you're in capitalism,

00:37:12.653 --> 00:37:16.130
you might get lulled into
thinking that no other mode of

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.900
production is available.
 

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.903
If you're in patriarchy,
you might get lulled into

00:37:20.903 --> 00:37:24.400
thinking that no other mode of
production is available;

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:29.648
yet as Jameson points out,
the tension between corporate

00:37:29.648 --> 00:37:33.369
hierarchy and patriarchal
hierarchy--

00:37:33.369 --> 00:37:35.304
the tension,
in other words,

00:37:35.304 --> 00:37:39.315
which very often drives a wedge
and has driven a wedge in

00:37:39.315 --> 00:37:43.400
polemic between Marxist and
feminist points of view--

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.795
is a reflection of the
coexistence of modes of

00:37:46.795 --> 00:37:49.889
production from completely
different eras:

00:37:49.889 --> 00:37:54.257
one contemporary,
one completely--at least

00:37:54.257 --> 00:37:59.956
insofar as it was the dominant--
a thing of the past,

00:37:59.956 --> 00:38:05.291
and yet persisting and still
overlapping with a mode of

00:38:05.291 --> 00:38:08.750
production that is contemporary.
 

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:14.110
All of that is simply a matter
of historical fact,

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:20.666
but in literary analysis you
begin to think of it in more

00:38:20.666 --> 00:38:24.077
formal terms,
and you see,

00:38:24.077 --> 00:38:29.849
for example,
the very choice of verse form--

00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:34.510
and I'm taking as an example
Shelley's famous poem "The

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:39.043
Ode to the West Wind"--
you see the very choice of

00:38:39.043 --> 00:38:43.704
verse form as an instance of
what Jameson calls "the

00:38:43.704 --> 00:38:48.117
ideology of form"
that can be understood in terms

00:38:48.117 --> 00:38:51.780
of the conflict of modes of
production.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:57.070
The verse form of Shelley's
"Ode to the West Wind"

00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:01.465
has five strophes,
and each strophe is exactly the

00:39:01.465 --> 00:39:02.989
same in form.
 

00:39:02.989 --> 00:39:08.677
It is simultaneously a sonnet
and--the first twelve lines of

00:39:08.677 --> 00:39:13.692
which, concluding in a
couplet--a succession of terza

00:39:13.692 --> 00:39:14.559
rima.
 

00:39:14.559 --> 00:39:19.231
Now these two forms brought
together, synthesized as a

00:39:19.231 --> 00:39:24.786
single strophic form in Shelley,
are coded in entirely different

00:39:24.786 --> 00:39:25.579
ways.
 

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:29.090
Each aspect of them has an
ideology.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.648
Terza rima is coded
"prophecy"

00:39:32.648 --> 00:39:36.480
because it is in the tradition
of Dante.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.121
It's the verse form in which
The Divine Comedy is

00:39:39.121 --> 00:39:42.097
written,
and it is a mode that is

00:39:42.097 --> 00:39:48.929
expressive of hope that resolves
all contradiction in the divine,

00:39:48.929 --> 00:39:52.271
in the revelation of the
divine, in The

00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:57.161
Paradiso; so that
terza rima expresses for Shelley

00:39:57.161 --> 00:40:02.192
the hope of the poem,
which is that the west wind

00:40:02.192 --> 00:40:08.340
will be through him the trumpet
of a political prophecy.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:12.630
If winter's here,
can spring be far behind?

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:17.059
Revolution is in the offing,
everything's going to be great.

00:40:17.059 --> 00:40:21.159
But at the same time,
the poem is shot through with a

00:40:21.159 --> 00:40:24.393
kind of pessimism--a sort of,
if you will,

00:40:24.393 --> 00:40:27.557
realism;
an awareness that this notion

00:40:27.557 --> 00:40:30.159
of prophecy is rather
farfetched.

00:40:30.159 --> 00:40:32.769
Why should the wind do his
bidding?

00:40:32.769 --> 00:40:34.320
The wind is just wind.
 

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.130
It's not inspiration.
 

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:40.923
Therefore, the very stanza
which is written in terza rima

00:40:40.923 --> 00:40:45.889
is written at the same time as a
sonnet, fourteen lines.

00:40:45.889 --> 00:40:50.927
The first stanza in particular
is coded not just as a sonnet

00:40:50.927 --> 00:40:55.539
but also as an allusion
specifically to one sonnet,

00:40:55.539 --> 00:40:58.010
Shakespeare's seventy-third
sonnet,

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:01.335
which begins "That time of
year in me thou mayest

00:41:01.335 --> 00:41:04.489
behold"--
in which I'm getting old.

00:41:04.489 --> 00:41:07.050
I don't have any hair left.
 

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:11.650
I'm just a bare-ruined choir
where late sweet birds sang.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.730
In other words,
I am in a parlous state,

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:16.235
I am getting old,
and there's nothing to be done

00:41:16.235 --> 00:41:16.929
about it.
 

00:41:16.929 --> 00:41:22.737
At the end of the poem,
the embers of my fire are about

00:41:22.737 --> 00:41:24.889
to be snuffed out.
 

00:41:24.889 --> 00:41:28.030
There is just no hope for it.
 

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:30.730
That's the way it is:
you get old.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:33.737
In other words,
winter's here and spring isn't

00:41:33.737 --> 00:41:34.340
coming.
 

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.119
There is no prophetic
possibility.

00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:42.969
There is only the reality of
the trajectory of a life spent.

00:41:42.969 --> 00:41:46.018
If there is rise,
there is also fall.

00:41:46.018 --> 00:41:49.068
If there is development,
there is also decline and

00:41:49.068 --> 00:41:52.985
decay,
and these, as the sonnet form

00:41:52.985 --> 00:41:56.764
codes it,
are simple facts of life that

00:41:56.764 --> 00:42:00.034
poetic idealism,
that Romanticism,

00:42:00.034 --> 00:42:01.750
cannot override.
 

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:08.934
So what you get in Shelley's
verse form is a tension between

00:42:08.934 --> 00:42:12.855
ideas,
the prophetic idea which you

00:42:12.855 --> 00:42:19.009
can associate with a feudal and
theocentric world in which the

00:42:19.009 --> 00:42:25.768
contradictions of reality really
can be resolved theologically,

00:42:25.768 --> 00:42:29.284
on the one hand,
and a kind of proto-realist

00:42:29.284 --> 00:42:34.190
tradition in which we just have
to come to terms with the way

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.266
things are,
coded through--which is,

00:42:37.266 --> 00:42:40.179
after all,
proto-Enlightenment,

00:42:40.179 --> 00:42:44.952
and Shakespeare is often sort
of thought of as a

00:42:44.952 --> 00:42:49.320
proto-Enlightenment figure-- the
sonnet.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.418
So formally,
both the terza rima and the

00:42:52.418 --> 00:42:57.025
sonnet participate in what
Jameson calls "the ideology

00:42:57.025 --> 00:43:00.362
of form,"
and they reflect modes of

00:43:00.362 --> 00:43:04.257
production,
feudal and Enlightenment

00:43:04.257 --> 00:43:05.510
respectively.
 

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:11.474
They reflect attitudes that one
can associate with those modes

00:43:11.474 --> 00:43:13.039
of production.
 

00:43:13.039 --> 00:43:18.768
So that's an example of the way
in which the political--

00:43:18.768 --> 00:43:22.016
perhaps one had better call it
quasi-conscious because Shelley

00:43:22.016 --> 00:43:24.199
was an incredibly self-conscious
poet--

00:43:24.199 --> 00:43:29.126
the way in which the political
"quasi-conscious"

00:43:29.126 --> 00:43:34.659
expresses itself at the third
or historical level of analysis.

00:43:34.659 --> 00:43:40.416
Now in formal terms--and I have
already sort of gotten into

00:43:40.416 --> 00:43:42.561
this,
and I'll go through it rather

00:43:42.561 --> 00:43:44.659
quickly because there isn't much
time left--

00:43:44.659 --> 00:43:51.706
in formal terms we can think of
the essential critical task at

00:43:51.706 --> 00:43:58.059
the first or political level as
one of thematization.

00:43:58.059 --> 00:44:01.523
That is to say,
what theme is the plot

00:44:01.523 --> 00:44:07.139
structure of an individual
symbolic act trying to express?

00:44:07.139 --> 00:44:12.547
What is the contradiction
that's being resolved in this

00:44:12.547 --> 00:44:14.050
symbolic act?
 

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:18.117
At the second level,
the formal principle that we do

00:44:18.117 --> 00:44:21.956
bring to bear is the idea,
the Bakhtinian idea,

00:44:21.956 --> 00:44:25.010
of heteroglossia:
the clash of voices,

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:29.577
the way in which the voice is
no longer individual but rather

00:44:29.577 --> 00:44:33.440
social,
the representative of a social

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:39.331
point of view that expresses
itself through the individual

00:44:39.331 --> 00:44:41.400
author's writing.
 

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.072
At the third level,
you get what Jameson calls

00:44:44.072 --> 00:44:46.152
"a repertoire of
devices,"

00:44:46.152 --> 00:44:49.360
and I have already reflected a
little bit on that.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.012
Let me just add another
example, also taken from

00:44:52.012 --> 00:44:54.501
Romanticism,
in keeping with Jameson's

00:44:54.501 --> 00:44:58.510
exemplification of the overlap
of modes of production as being

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:02.190
particularly interesting in the
age of Enlightenment.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:07.644
In Romanticism there is a long
tradition leading up to it of

00:45:07.644 --> 00:45:10.050
the formal Pindaric ode.
 

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:13.813
Wordsworth is still making use
of that tradition in writing his

00:45:13.813 --> 00:45:15.673
ode,
"Intimations of

00:45:15.673 --> 00:45:18.829
Immortality,"
but in the meantime he and

00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:22.199
Coleridge have developed a new
kind of ode,

00:45:22.199 --> 00:45:23.856
if you will,
which is called the

00:45:23.856 --> 00:45:26.851
"conversation poem":
Coleridge's "Frost at

00:45:26.851 --> 00:45:29.204
Midnight"
and "This Lime-Tree Bower

00:45:29.204 --> 00:45:31.449
My Prison,"
Wordsworth's "Tintern

00:45:31.449 --> 00:45:34.980
Abbey" are notable examples
of the conversation poem.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.242
Now the difference is very
clearly intelligible in terms of

00:45:39.242 --> 00:45:41.889
a conflict of modes of
production.

00:45:41.889 --> 00:45:46.601
The formal ode,
derived ultimately from Pindar

00:45:46.601 --> 00:45:53.619
celebrating Olympic victories of
aristocratic patrons in Greece--

00:45:53.619 --> 00:45:56.827
horse races,
foot races, wrestling matches:

00:45:56.827 --> 00:46:01.639
that's the original purpose to
which the formal ode was put--

00:46:01.639 --> 00:46:08.219
plainly is coded once again as
feudal-aristocratic,

00:46:08.219 --> 00:46:12.250
whereas the conversation poem
belongs very much,

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:16.090
as the word suggests,
in the public sphere.

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:18.300
It's the atmosphere of the
coffeehouse.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.985
It's the atmosphere in which
people sit down and talk

00:46:21.985 --> 00:46:25.599
together, exchange views,
and address each other.

00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:30.318
It is a poem always of address
to some individual person that

00:46:30.318 --> 00:46:33.699
turns to that person at a
certain point,

00:46:33.699 --> 00:46:37.398
evokes the nature of that
person, sometimes solicits that

00:46:37.398 --> 00:46:38.719
person's opinions.
 

00:46:38.719 --> 00:46:42.849
In other words,
it's a poem that performs

00:46:42.849 --> 00:46:44.090
dialogism.
 

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:49.672
It's a poem that performs the
sense of the give-and-take of a

00:46:49.672 --> 00:46:53.394
much more open,
democratic culture in the

00:46:53.394 --> 00:46:55.070
public sphere.
 

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:59.797
So you can see that the very
transition from the formal ode

00:46:59.797 --> 00:47:03.952
to the conversation poem is
itself intelligible as a

00:47:03.952 --> 00:47:08.719
transition between--
or what Jameson calls "a

00:47:08.719 --> 00:47:13.951
cultural revolution"
brought in by a seismic shift

00:47:13.951 --> 00:47:16.530
in--
modes of production.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:17.195
All right.
 

00:47:17.195 --> 00:47:19.523
So these exemplify,
in various ways,

00:47:19.523 --> 00:47:22.449
what can be done with these
three levels.

00:47:22.449 --> 00:47:26.570
Jameson himself reminds us of
the dangers.

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:30.469
If we think of a narrative as a
symbolic act,

00:47:30.469 --> 00:47:35.304
we are much too prone either to
forget that it's based on

00:47:35.304 --> 00:47:40.139
reality by emphasizing the
structuralist nature of what's

00:47:40.139 --> 00:47:44.628
going on or to forget that form
is involved at all by

00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:48.771
emphasizing the social
contradiction that's being

00:47:48.771 --> 00:47:50.239
resolved.
 

00:47:50.239 --> 00:47:53.541
As Jameson says,
these two dangers at the first

00:47:53.541 --> 00:47:57.418
level are the danger of
structuralism and the danger of

00:47:57.418 --> 00:47:59.070
vulgar materialism.
 

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:04.237
The point in analyzing the
symbolic act is to sustain a

00:48:04.237 --> 00:48:09.596
balance or a synthesis between
formal and social elements

00:48:09.596 --> 00:48:11.510
within the text.
 

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:16.128
At the second level,
the problem is that if we start

00:48:16.128 --> 00:48:21.110
thinking in terms of
un-reconcilable class conflict,

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:25.585
our analysis can become static,
as though class perspectives

00:48:25.585 --> 00:48:29.282
didn't shift,
as though one perspective might

00:48:29.282 --> 00:48:33.690
not succeed another as the
hegemonic: in other words,

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.210
as though change didn't take
place,

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:40.054
as though there was always the
same old-same old in class

00:48:40.054 --> 00:48:40.809
conflict.
 

00:48:40.809 --> 00:48:43.760
The boss is always going to
speak demeaningly of the worker.

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.902
The worker is always going to
laugh at the boss behind his

00:48:46.902 --> 00:48:47.289
back.
 

00:48:47.289 --> 00:48:50.440
This is the way it is;
this is the way it will always

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:50.659
be.
 

00:48:50.659 --> 00:48:54.599
There are static relations in
other words among the classes

00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.570
that history can't resolve.
 

00:48:56.570 --> 00:49:00.498
Finally, at the third level,
there is the danger of thinking

00:49:00.498 --> 00:49:03.166
in terms of impasse--
late capitalism,

00:49:03.166 --> 00:49:06.222
for example,
as an impasse that simply can't

00:49:06.222 --> 00:49:07.429
be surmounted.
 

00:49:07.429 --> 00:49:11.148
Think of Adorno and his
incredible gloom about the

00:49:11.148 --> 00:49:12.590
culture industry.
 

00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:14.940
There isn't much hope in
Adorno, &gt;

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:15.420
is there?
 

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:18.557
And by the same token,
you could argue that poor old

00:49:18.557 --> 00:49:21.389
Jameson talking about history as
necessity,

00:49:21.389 --> 00:49:25.125
history as what hurts,
history as just what has

00:49:25.125 --> 00:49:27.307
happened--
by the same token,

00:49:27.307 --> 00:49:31.211
you could argue that Jameson,
too, is perhaps a little bit

00:49:31.211 --> 00:49:33.489
subject to this sense of
impasse,

00:49:33.489 --> 00:49:37.708
which is why I quote for you,
as these people themselves

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:41.057
often do,
the ringing warning of Marx in

00:49:41.057 --> 00:49:44.458
the Eleventh Thesis on
Feuerbach: "The

00:49:44.458 --> 00:49:48.829
philosophers have only
interpreted the world in various

00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:49.639
ways.
 

00:49:49.639 --> 00:49:51.719
The point, however,
is to change it."

00:49:51.719 --> 00:49:55.070
That is ultimately the focus of
Marx's analysis.

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:57.139
Let's revisit Tony in
the remaining minute.

00:49:57.139 --> 00:50:00.880
Now a reified realist approach
to Tony,

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.260
the kind that Jameson
criticizes on the sheet,

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:06.480
would point out that nothing
happens to Neato and Speedy.

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.369
They are manifest villains,
and yet at the same time,

00:50:10.369 --> 00:50:12.539
nothing can happen to them.
 

00:50:12.539 --> 00:50:15.539
They simply have their place in
the social order:

00:50:15.539 --> 00:50:19.101
one of them is a fastidious
aristocrat who doesn't want to

00:50:19.101 --> 00:50:21.775
get dirty,
the other is completely

00:50:21.775 --> 00:50:26.003
committed to productivity and
the time clock and the work

00:50:26.003 --> 00:50:28.719
ethic,
a bourgeois Speedy.

00:50:28.719 --> 00:50:31.300
There they are;
nothing to be done.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:34.289
They're not nice to Tony but
nothing happens to them.

00:50:34.289 --> 00:50:36.170
There is no recrimination.
 

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:39.416
But then at the first level,
if we understand this as a

00:50:39.416 --> 00:50:42.168
symbolic act,
the resolution of what would

00:50:42.168 --> 00:50:45.809
otherwise be a hopeless conflict
is through friendship--

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:49.010
the friendship of Bumpy and
Tony;

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:52.219
the fact that it's perfectly
okay if I'm just a working guy.

00:50:52.219 --> 00:50:53.309
I've got my buddies.
 

00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.889
We go out.
 

00:50:53.889 --> 00:50:54.570
We drink beer.
 

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:55.800
We have a good time.
 

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.130
Life is great.
 

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:59.106
It doesn't matter,
in other words,

00:50:59.106 --> 00:51:02.880
that there's a class structure,
that there's a social system.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:06.349
"I'm happy,"
Tony says in effect.

00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:07.829
"I like my job."
 

00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:09.554
That in itself,
of course, is a resolution,

00:51:09.554 --> 00:51:10.539
&gt;
 

00:51:10.539 --> 00:51:14.382
is a symbolic act and a
resolution in advance of the

00:51:14.382 --> 00:51:18.300
conflicts that the story might
otherwise manifest.

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.871
At the second level,
you get the discourse of

00:51:20.871 --> 00:51:21.690
ideologemes.
 

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:24.429
"I can't help you,"
says Neato the car.

00:51:24.429 --> 00:51:26.739
"I don't want to get
dirty."

00:51:26.739 --> 00:51:29.079
"I can't help you,"
says Speedy the car.

00:51:29.079 --> 00:51:30.739
"I am too busy."
 

00:51:30.739 --> 00:51:33.018
"I can help you,"
says Bumpy;

00:51:33.018 --> 00:51:36.800
but notice that this is all
within an individual,

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.952
single code,
and that's what the complete

00:51:39.952 --> 00:51:43.969
parallelism of these three
utterances shows us.

00:51:43.969 --> 00:51:47.527
Within a single code,
these ideologemes,

00:51:47.527 --> 00:51:52.909
which can't really be resolved,
get themselves expressed.

00:51:52.909 --> 00:51:53.634
All right.
 

00:51:53.634 --> 00:51:56.750
Now finally modes of
production: plainly,

00:51:56.750 --> 00:52:00.588
the very existence of Neato and
Speedy in the same story

00:52:00.588 --> 00:52:04.914
suggests that there is a certain
tension between the feudal and

00:52:04.914 --> 00:52:08.771
the bourgeois at work,
but it's not a tension that in

00:52:08.771 --> 00:52:11.268
any way necessarily works itself
out.

00:52:11.268 --> 00:52:14.353
The important thing to notice
here, it seems to me,

00:52:14.353 --> 00:52:17.190
is the conflict between pulling
and pushing.

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:21.253
It's very interesting--and I've
said this before--that a tow

00:52:21.253 --> 00:52:25.384
truck, something that pulls--and
once again Tony is a mode of

00:52:25.384 --> 00:52:26.900
production, right?
 

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.670
He's a tow truck, right?
 

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:32.340
And something that pulls has to
be pushed.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:37.739
Bumpy, like the Little Engine
that Could, is a sort of a

00:52:37.739 --> 00:52:41.567
throwback to an earlier,
less energized,

00:52:41.567 --> 00:52:45.199
less powerful mode of
production.

00:52:45.199 --> 00:52:46.469
He has to push.
 

00:52:46.469 --> 00:52:50.664
Think of the way walls get put
up: a prefabricated wall before

00:52:50.664 --> 00:52:54.789
the invention of the crane and
the pulley has to be pushed up

00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:56.510
by a bunch of people.
 

00:52:56.510 --> 00:53:00.471
Pushing is the essential labor
mode before the kind of

00:53:00.471 --> 00:53:05.030
technology arises that makes it
possible to pull something.

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:07.000
After that, you have a crane.
 

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.789
You run the hook down,
and you just pull the wall up

00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:10.500
into place.
 

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.577
Before then,
you got maybe one person

00:53:12.577 --> 00:53:16.097
standing on a rafter with a rope
kind of pulling but everybody

00:53:16.097 --> 00:53:18.349
else is down on the ground
pushing;

00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:22.400
and so the relationship between
pushing and pulling in the story

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.063
is a crucially important one
which suggests the overlap of

00:53:26.063 --> 00:53:28.699
older and newer modes of
production,

00:53:28.699 --> 00:53:33.567
all of which can be resolved at
Jameson's third or historical

00:53:33.567 --> 00:53:35.190
level of analysis.
 

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.523
Okay.
 

00:53:35.523 --> 00:53:38.590
So much then for Jameson and
for Tony.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:42.173
We'll be coming back to Tony
again next time in the

00:53:42.173 --> 00:53:45.130
context of talking about the New
Historicism.

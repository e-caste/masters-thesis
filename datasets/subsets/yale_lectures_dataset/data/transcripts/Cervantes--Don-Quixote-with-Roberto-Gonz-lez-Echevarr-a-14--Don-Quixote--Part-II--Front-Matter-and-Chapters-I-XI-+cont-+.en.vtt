00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.199
Prof: Something that I
will be charting as we move

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:14.548
through the episodes that make
up Part II is how they are

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:21.001
reminiscent of others in Part I;
how, in many cases,

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:28.365
these episodes in Part II are
rewritings of episodes in Part

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:28.990
I.
 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.016
This is an issue that doesn't
have to be just stated,

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:35.950
but also pondered.
 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.840
I mean, what does that mean?
 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.471
Does it make a statement about
there not being a possibility of

00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:49.237
something new and original,
of memory impinging on the

00:00:49.237 --> 00:00:53.010
present so strongly that you
cannot really move away from it,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.470
and so forth?
 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.780
So when I discuss these
episodes I will try to link them

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.116
to episodes in Part I,
and I hope that you do the same

00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:12.177
as you read,
because the book invites you to

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:18.025
do so from the very beginning,
when Sansón Carrasco

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:23.739
sort of takes over as the
internal author of Part II,

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:27.897
and you realize that what
Sansón Carrasco wants Don

00:01:27.897 --> 00:01:30.670
Quixote to do is to reenact Part
I,

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.997
to be like he was in Part I and
to do the things that he did in

00:01:33.997 --> 00:01:34.480
Part I.
 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.003
And, in fact,
many of the characters in Part

00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:45.209
II that Don Quixote and Sancho
meet want them to act like as

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.629
they did in Part I.
 

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:52.581
So this is something that can
be seen as sort of an

00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:58.129
overarching topic about in my
discussions of Part II,

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:05.858
and that I hope that you will
also do as you read and think

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.989
about Part II.
 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:15.027
We are going to begin today
where we left off in the last

00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:18.587
class,
talking about that

00:02:18.587 --> 00:02:24.389
all-important term that I was
discussing,

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:34.560
called desengaño.
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.997
Desengaño is
perhaps the most important

00:02:37.997 --> 00:02:40.180
concept of the Spanish Baroque.
 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.342
Remember, Baroque is
essentially seventeenth century

00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:46.378
spilling over into the
eighteenth century where it

00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:50.590
becomes Rococo,
if you want to be more precise.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.258
So desengaño is
perhaps the most important

00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:57.175
concept of the Spanish Baroque;
it means undeceiving,

00:02:57.175 --> 00:03:03.128
opening ones eyes to reality,
awakening to the truth;

00:03:03.128 --> 00:03:06.750
these are all valid
translations of the term.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.246
Engaño,
in Spanish, means 'deceit,' to

00:03:12.246 --> 00:03:15.806
be fooled;
'te engaño' means 'I

00:03:15.806 --> 00:03:21.544
fool you';
'engañarse' is 'to fool

00:03:21.544 --> 00:03:23.310
one self.'
 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.812
This concept is fundamental to
Part II because the whole plot

00:03:29.812 --> 00:03:36.098
of the novel seems to be moving
towards disillusionment.

00:03:36.098 --> 00:03:39.759
So let me give you some
definitions of

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:45.400
desengaño and
comment on them so that we can

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.413
have as clear a concept,
as clear an idea of this

00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:52.288
concept as possible.
 

00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:58.032
The first is from Otis Green
and his book Spain and the

00:03:58.032 --> 00:04:00.449
Western Tradition.
 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:06.263
Otis Green was a great
Hispanist at the University of

00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:11.128
Pennsylvania for many years,
through the '40s,

00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:15.735
'50s, and even '60s,
and his book is a treasure of

00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:20.939
information about Spanish
literature and culture of the

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:22.290
Golden Age.
 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.730
He writes: "This
desengaño is

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.492
related to the sort of awakening
to the nature of reality that

00:04:32.492 --> 00:04:36.649
the prodigal son must have
experienced,

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:41.440
'I will arise and go to my
father,' says the prodigal son.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.389
This waking to true awareness
is called 'caer en la

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:53.910
cuenta' [in Spanish;
it's another way...]

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:04.709
'caer en la cuenta' to
have the scales fall from one's

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:11.009
eyes, to see things as they are.
 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.250
Such a state of mind is
desirable."

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.762
I continue with Green:
"Disillusionment comes to

00:05:18.762 --> 00:05:23.449
be viewed even to be venerated
as a sort of wisdom,

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:29.867
the wisdom of the stoic sapiens
or wise man of antiquity who was

00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:35.879
fully aware of what constituted
the summum bonum,

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:40.944
the supreme good,
and was utterly un-enticed by

00:05:40.944 --> 00:05:43.367
everything else."
 

00:05:43.367 --> 00:05:44.579
Unquote.
 

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:49.898
You know who were the stoics
were, so this wise stoic man

00:05:49.898 --> 00:05:54.932
knew what the real good was and
what was not valuable:

00:05:54.932 --> 00:06:00.819
"Caer en la cuenta
[I go on with another quote from

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.766
Green],
to come to one's self was the

00:06:04.766 --> 00:06:08.916
phrase most used in connection
with the type of

00:06:08.916 --> 00:06:13.519
desengaño we are
considering here.

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:19.214
It signified a passing from
ignorance to knowledge,

00:06:19.214 --> 00:06:25.023
and awakening from the falsity
of one's dream."

00:06:25.023 --> 00:06:26.389
Unquote.
 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:33.759
So you can see now this
dialectic, as it were,

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.810
between engaño
and desengaño,

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.610
deceit and un-deceit,
deceit and disillusionment,

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.160
and coming to realize what is
the truth.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.346
The following is the quote that
I gave you at the end of the

00:06:47.346 --> 00:06:48.269
last class.
 

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:55.360
It was on the back of that map
with the Don Quixote's route on

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.026
the way to Saragossa,
and then the swerve to

00:07:00.026 --> 00:07:03.100
Barcelona, and it's the
following,

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.310
and it is from Baltasar
Gracián.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:22.019
 
 

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:29.346
Baltasar Gracián was a
Jesuit who wrote about politics,

00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:31.629
wit and rhetoric.
 

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:37.538
He lived between 1601 and 1658
and he wrote a very famous

00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:39.649
allegorical novel.
 

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:43.944
An allegorical novel is a novel
in which the characters

00:07:43.944 --> 00:07:46.649
represent abstractions:
reason,

00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:55.543
truth, and so forth,
and the novel is called El

00:07:55.543 --> 00:08:02.439
Criticón,
The Big Critic.

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:06.384
Here is a quote from that book,
it's the quote that you have,

00:08:06.384 --> 00:08:08.949
it's a quote about
desengaño:

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:14.988
"The most monstrous of all
is the placing of Deceit at the

00:08:14.988 --> 00:08:20.250
world's front gate and
disillusionment at the exit--

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.279
a disastrous handicap
sufficient to ruin our life

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:25.959
entirely since ...
 

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:30.875
to make a misstep at the
beginning of life causes one to

00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:35.792
lurch headlong with greater
speed each day and end up in

00:08:35.792 --> 00:08:37.580
utter perdition.
 

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.308
Who made such an arrangement,
who ordained it?

00:08:41.308 --> 00:08:45.956
Now I am more convinced than
ever that all is upside down in

00:08:45.956 --> 00:08:46.980
this world.
 

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.799
Disillusionment should stand at
the world's entrance and should

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:54.558
place himself immediately at the
shoulder of the neophyte,

00:08:54.558 --> 00:08:59.529
to free him from the dangers
that lie in wait for him.

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:03.123
But since the newcomer--by an
opposite and contrary

00:09:03.123 --> 00:09:07.147
arrangement makes his first
encounter with deceit [who at

00:09:07.147 --> 00:09:10.884
the beginning presents
everything to him in perverted

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:14.476
and reversed order]
he heads for the left hand road

00:09:14.476 --> 00:09:17.639
and strives on to
destruction."

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:20.220
As you can see,
this is very allegorical the

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.577
left hand road;
the left is always the bad,

00:09:22.577 --> 00:09:23.418
sinister.
 

00:09:23.418 --> 00:09:26.639
'Sinistra' it means
left, this is why it has that

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:27.460
connotation.
 

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:35.254
The left road is the bad road,
and so you have deceit and

00:09:35.254 --> 00:09:39.264
disillusionment,
and he says,

00:09:39.264 --> 00:09:44.840
is placing deceit--if this is
the door to life,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.552
deceit is here,
and then the end of life is the

00:09:48.552 --> 00:09:51.080
other D,
Disillusionment;

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.440
this is what he saying.
 

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:58.220
Gracián was allegorical
in his mode of thinking.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.068
Deceits are all of Don
Quixote's illusions,

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:06.558
and those of the other
characters in the novel.

00:10:06.558 --> 00:10:11.732
While desengaño
is what they wind up or what

00:10:11.732 --> 00:10:17.086
they reach, disillusionment,
realizing that it is all vanity

00:10:17.086 --> 00:10:18.538
of vanities.
 

00:10:18.538 --> 00:10:24.101
This is the reason why so much
of what happens in Part II is

00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:24.950
staged.
 

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:31.722
Deceit is the theatricality of
so many events which are made

00:10:31.722 --> 00:10:36.471
up, constructed;
deceit is the dream of books

00:10:36.471 --> 00:10:41.355
that Don Quixote dreams,
it is the unbroken chain of

00:10:41.355 --> 00:10:46.048
texts masked in reality,
and even of language also

00:10:46.048 --> 00:10:48.058
masking reality.
 

00:10:48.058 --> 00:10:55.198
So Don Quixote's dream of
books, these illusions about the

00:10:55.198 --> 00:11:02.590
romances of chivalry and the
knights of old is a deceit,

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.530
and disillusionment,
is coming to realize that it is

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.284
that,
that it is nothing but a

00:11:09.284 --> 00:11:14.265
deceit, and the unbroken chain
of texts is because in Don

00:11:14.265 --> 00:11:18.269
Quixote's mind one text leads to
another,

00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:19.830
leads to another,
leads to another.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.379
It's a humanist dream,
the humanists,

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:26.139
who were philologists,
lovers of language,

00:11:26.139 --> 00:11:31.711
students of the classics,
thought in terms of texts

00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:35.265
leading to texts,
leading to texts,

00:11:35.265 --> 00:11:37.918
without ever getting to
reality,

00:11:37.918 --> 00:11:42.200
and of language of something
that has its own reality,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.440
and what the baroque does is
undermine all of that and show

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.700
that it is all a dream.
 

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.346
The best example of these
patterns of deceit and

00:11:55.346 --> 00:11:59.428
disillusionment,
or of going from deceit to

00:11:59.428 --> 00:12:03.441
disillusionment is the play by
Calderón de la Barca,

00:12:03.441 --> 00:12:05.240
Life is a Dream.
 

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.038
I have put his name before on
the board,

00:12:09.038 --> 00:12:11.158
but I will do it again so that
you remember him,

00:12:11.158 --> 00:12:14.950
he's one of the classics of
Spanish literature--

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.658
You can't see from there?
 

00:12:17.658 --> 00:12:40.408
Pedro Calderón de la
Barca.

00:12:40.408 --> 00:12:42.232
I am very fond of Pedro
Calderón de la Barca and

00:12:42.232 --> 00:12:43.736
of his play,
Life is a Dream,

00:12:43.736 --> 00:12:46.208
because I wrote my entire
doctoral dissertation about that

00:12:46.208 --> 00:12:49.455
play,
and it is one of the classics

00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:51.720
of Spanish literature.
 

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.720
In that play,
Life is a Dream,

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.797
in English, prince Segismundo
has been kept in a tower since

00:13:01.797 --> 00:13:06.019
birth because an omen told his
father,

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:09.996
king Basilio,
that Segismundo would be a

00:13:09.996 --> 00:13:14.278
ruthless tyrant if he ever
became king,

00:13:14.278 --> 00:13:18.830
so he has him grow up,
since he's a baby,

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:23.509
in a tower, cared for by
Clotaldo and so forth.

00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:29.096
To put him to a test,
Basilio has Segismundo drugged

00:13:29.096 --> 00:13:34.462
and brought to the palace,
where, when he awakens,

00:13:34.462 --> 00:13:37.750
he is treated like a king.
 

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:43.808
Confused, Segismundo acts
violently,

00:13:43.808 --> 00:13:51.480
he tries to rape a woman,
throws a soldier off a balcony,

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.932
and so forth,
confirming the omen,

00:13:54.932 --> 00:14:00.259
in a way,
so he is drugged and brought

00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:05.931
back to the tower where,
upon awakening,

00:14:05.931 --> 00:14:12.864
he does not know if what
happened in the palace was true

00:14:12.864 --> 00:14:15.259
or just a dream.
 

00:14:15.259 --> 00:14:20.104
Meanwhile, the people who have
found out about Segismundo's

00:14:20.104 --> 00:14:22.831
existence,
the people in the kingdom,

00:14:22.831 --> 00:14:26.370
revolt and come to get him to
fight against his father.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.412
Segismundo hesitates because he
does not know if this is another

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:34.282
dream,
but decides to go with them and

00:14:34.282 --> 00:14:39.664
act prudently and justly,
this time, because he realizes

00:14:39.664 --> 00:14:43.690
that even in dreams it is best
to do the good,

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:47.710
because if life is like a
dream, the only true life is the

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.048
life after death.
 

00:14:49.048 --> 00:14:53.538
He dethrones his father,
but does not kill him;

00:14:53.538 --> 00:14:58.857
and marries the woman he should
marry, not the one he had lusted

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:03.586
after during his first day in
the palace--he controls his

00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:04.600
desires.
 

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.633
The message is that life may
very well be like a dream in a

00:15:09.633 --> 00:15:13.278
platonic sense,
but even so one must behave

00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:14.320
morally.
 

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.460
As you can see,
the plot of the play,

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.778
which I have simplified,
goes from deceit,

00:15:19.778 --> 00:15:24.570
the first visit to the palace,
to disillusionment,

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:28.028
when Segismundo awakens back in
the tower,

00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:33.230
and wisdom, when he comes to
know that life is like a dream,

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.559
as are political power,
the trappings of government,

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:39.428
and everything else.
 

00:15:39.428 --> 00:15:44.164
The only thing that,
by the way, that he knows was

00:15:44.164 --> 00:15:49.285
true when he awakens in the
tower is his love for this

00:15:49.285 --> 00:15:52.441
woman,
the only continuity is the

00:15:52.441 --> 00:15:55.571
emotion of love,
and that is a neo-platonic

00:15:55.571 --> 00:15:56.928
element in the play.
 

00:15:56.928 --> 00:15:59.164
It's a more complicated play
than I have just made it seem

00:15:59.164 --> 00:15:59.440
here.
 

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:06.994
We will have occasion--we will
see a very similar story when

00:16:06.994 --> 00:16:13.778
Sancho becomes a ruler later in
the Quixote.

00:16:13.778 --> 00:16:21.436
My suggestion here is that the
plot of the Quixote as a

00:16:21.436 --> 00:16:29.720
whole follows a similar outline
from deceit to disillusionment,

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.450
from engaño to
desengaño.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.339
We will have,
of course, occasion to revisit

00:16:36.339 --> 00:16:40.408
this when we come to the end of
the novel,

00:16:40.408 --> 00:16:45.940
but keep it in mind also,
keep all of this in mind,

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:52.178
also, when you read for next
week the wonderful story,

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:57.110
The Glass Graduate,
El licenciado vidriera,

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.820
which you are to read for next
week--

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.960
next week we have a big week,
we have The Glass

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.591
Graduate,
and also we are going to be

00:17:03.591 --> 00:17:08.025
doing two of the main essays in
the Casebook, the

00:17:08.025 --> 00:17:12.712
ones by Spitzer and by Auerbach,
about whom I spoke in the last

00:17:12.712 --> 00:17:15.065
class already,
so you should be prepared to

00:17:15.065 --> 00:17:17.384
read that essay of "The
Enchanted Dulcinea,"

00:17:17.384 --> 00:17:20.009
an episode that we are going to
be discussing here today.

00:17:20.009 --> 00:17:25.298
This is so we can keep our
course not going from deceit to

00:17:25.298 --> 00:17:29.101
disillusionment,
but to be wide-eyed about

00:17:29.101 --> 00:17:32.720
everything from the very
beginning.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.920
So let us begin today as we
move to the episodes in the

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.669
Quixote about the discussion
of Don Quixote and Sancho about

00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:48.868
knight-errants and saints that
I'm sure you remember.

00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:53.923
First, there is the exordium by
Cide Hamete Benengeli and

00:17:53.923 --> 00:17:59.250
comments by the narrator about
what the translator said,

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:05.500
or what the narrator said about
Cide Hamete Benengeli,

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.220
but the reader does not know
where these comments appeared--

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.368
and we talked about that in the
last class.

00:18:11.368 --> 00:18:13.818
They are not in the text,
as it were,

00:18:13.818 --> 00:18:17.452
but in a sort of meta-text or
virtual text that is like a

00:18:17.452 --> 00:18:21.150
running commentary about the
composition of the novel,

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:27.778
and this is one new feature in
Part II that I mentioned before.

00:18:27.778 --> 00:18:33.618
Now, Sancho subjects Don
Quixote to a rigorous cross

00:18:33.618 --> 00:18:40.259
examination and gets him to say
that saints are better than

00:18:40.259 --> 00:18:44.838
knights--I'm sure you remember
that.

00:18:44.838 --> 00:18:51.723
Sancho has rhetorical skills,
as does Sansón,

00:18:51.723 --> 00:18:59.690
who earlier had used forensic
rhetoric to ease Don Quixote's

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.038
sally.
 

00:19:01.038 --> 00:19:05.450
Sansón may have acquired
those skills in Salamanca,

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:11.078
but where did Sancho learn them
or anything else,

00:19:11.078 --> 00:19:16.484
where did Sancho learn rhetoric
or all of this culture that he

00:19:16.484 --> 00:19:18.078
has in his mind?
 

00:19:18.078 --> 00:19:24.237
I think that the intimation is
that Sancho has learned a great

00:19:24.237 --> 00:19:28.816
deal not just from Don Quixote,
which he does,

00:19:28.816 --> 00:19:32.583
and we have seen,
but also from hearing sermons

00:19:32.583 --> 00:19:35.784
at church,
which he mentions in his

00:19:35.784 --> 00:19:38.009
discussion with his wife.
 

00:19:38.009 --> 00:19:42.873
The church is on this level
part of popular culture,

00:19:42.873 --> 00:19:48.308
or better, a vehicle for the
popularization of culture.

00:19:48.308 --> 00:19:54.115
Sancho may not know how to
read, but he has a culture in

00:19:54.115 --> 00:19:59.500
his head that he has absorbed
from the preachers.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:06.898
This is one way to explain the
evolution of Sancho and his

00:20:06.898 --> 00:20:13.130
increased intellectual and
rhetorical powers,

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.203
although, of course,
his relationship with Don

00:20:17.203 --> 00:20:19.704
Quixote,
as I will mention in a couple

00:20:19.704 --> 00:20:23.598
of minutes,
is obviously the most important.

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:28.259
The discussion per se,
the theme,

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:30.798
the topic of the discussion is
very serious here,

00:20:30.798 --> 00:20:37.577
too, because it plays into
religious debates of the time in

00:20:37.577 --> 00:20:39.932
Spain,
whose background is the

00:20:39.932 --> 00:20:40.670
Reformation.
 

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:45.339
The debates have to do with
good works and with

00:20:45.339 --> 00:20:53.237
predestination and free will,
Protestantism sided with

00:20:53.237 --> 00:20:57.838
predestination,
Catholicism,

00:20:57.838 --> 00:21:02.750
or at least one element within
Catholicism,

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.078
the most important one,
for free will.

00:21:05.078 --> 00:21:07.761
So therefore,
if you had free will,

00:21:07.761 --> 00:21:12.259
you could, through good
actions, gain access to heaven.

00:21:12.259 --> 00:21:16.868
Now, these are debates that to
us,

00:21:16.868 --> 00:21:19.288
in this our secular age seem
vacuous,

00:21:19.288 --> 00:21:23.650
but they were not in the
sixteenth century at all,

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.740
they were of the utmost
important.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.616
So here, in this discussion,
it is not just a question of

00:21:29.616 --> 00:21:33.540
arms versus letters,
which is a set discussion

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:38.670
piece, although there is a
reminiscence of that here,

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.348
but of good actions for their
own sake,

00:21:42.348 --> 00:21:46.450
and good actions for the sake
of glory.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:51.954
Sancho shows that the knight's
actions seem to be of this

00:21:51.954 --> 00:21:54.916
second kind,
actions to gain glory,

00:21:54.916 --> 00:21:58.906
and this feeds into the topic
of desengaño and

00:21:58.906 --> 00:22:00.528
engaño.
 

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:04.351
So to perform actions for the
sake of glory is to perform

00:22:04.351 --> 00:22:08.308
actions for the sake of deceit,
of engaño.

00:22:08.308 --> 00:22:14.753
Don Quixote counters by saying
that there were knights who were

00:22:14.753 --> 00:22:15.690
saints.
 

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:19.526
I suppose that he refers to
Saint George particularly,

00:22:19.526 --> 00:22:23.288
and adds that not everyone can
be a monk, he says.

00:22:23.288 --> 00:22:25.979
Cervantes is,
I think, pitting his

00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:29.318
relativistic and liberal take on
life,

00:22:29.318 --> 00:22:34.123
which is not antireligious,
against the religious zealots

00:22:34.123 --> 00:22:36.785
of the time,
I think, through this

00:22:36.785 --> 00:22:38.750
discussion of his characters.
 

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:43.672
So the discussion has a
contemporary relevancy that is

00:22:43.672 --> 00:22:48.636
political as well as religious,
and this is connected to what I

00:22:48.636 --> 00:22:51.728
said in one of my earlier
lectures about the fact that

00:22:51.728 --> 00:22:54.118
Part II is the first political
novel,

00:22:54.118 --> 00:22:59.305
because religion and politics
were intertwined in the Spain of

00:22:59.305 --> 00:23:02.788
the sixteenth and seventeenth
century,

00:23:02.788 --> 00:23:07.990
with all of the caveats that we
have learned by reading Elliott.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:13.772
So this discussion of the two
characters about this issue is

00:23:13.772 --> 00:23:18.380
consonant with the political
side of Part II.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.810
I want to underline that,
so that you have that clear in

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:22.558
your mind.
 

00:23:22.558 --> 00:23:28.720
Now, Sancho also demonstrates,
as he has before,

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.704
and as he will increasingly,
that he is endowed with natural

00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:36.652
reason,
which can lead him to

00:23:36.652 --> 00:23:42.058
understand sufficiently the most
difficult questions.

00:23:42.058 --> 00:23:46.731
Natural reason is a medieval
concept that survives through

00:23:46.731 --> 00:23:50.750
the Renaissance and reaches the
Enlightenment,

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:55.755
which underscores God's gift of
sufficient reason to every

00:23:55.755 --> 00:24:00.846
individual no matter what his
station in life to understand

00:24:00.846 --> 00:24:06.480
the fundamental questions,
issues of life.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:12.180
This will become an important
topic in Part II;

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:18.373
natural reason,
and Sancho will be the exemplar

00:24:18.373 --> 00:24:19.720
of this.
 

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.078
It is a theological concept.
 

00:24:23.078 --> 00:24:29.460
Now, one can see,
of course, that because Sancho

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:34.618
has been influenced by Don
Quixote,

00:24:34.618 --> 00:24:39.102
their arguments are like
discussions the knight could be

00:24:39.102 --> 00:24:43.269
having within himself,
or with himself.

00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:52.598
 
 

00:24:52.598 --> 00:24:55.308
What is the significance of
their mutual influence?

00:24:55.308 --> 00:25:00.339
I think that to propose a
concept of the self as

00:25:00.339 --> 00:25:05.048
relational, not as individual or
isolated.

00:25:05.048 --> 00:25:11.019
Not "I think,
therefore I am"--

00:25:11.019 --> 00:25:16.055
I'm quoting Descartes,
of course, which comes a little

00:25:16.055 --> 00:25:18.961
later--
not so much "I think,

00:25:18.961 --> 00:25:22.527
therefore I am";
as "I relate to others and

00:25:22.527 --> 00:25:25.415
myself emerges from that
commerce or dialogue with

00:25:25.415 --> 00:25:26.358
others."
 

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:29.769
This is what the Quixote
through this relationship

00:25:29.769 --> 00:25:33.058
between these two characters
seems to be suggesting.

00:25:33.058 --> 00:25:36.932
Now, of course,
this is a very profound

00:25:36.932 --> 00:25:40.702
philosophical statement,
a suggestion,

00:25:40.702 --> 00:25:46.920
but it also crucial in the
development of modern fiction.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.875
Think of Huck and Jim,
in Huckleberry Finn of their

00:25:50.875 --> 00:25:54.828
dialogues and of their influence
on each other,

00:25:54.828 --> 00:25:59.630
think of Holmes and
Dr. Watson,

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.970
to give you an example from
popular culture,

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:06.809
and even of those Faulknerian
characters that seem to overlap

00:26:06.809 --> 00:26:10.502
and blended to each other,
to the point that you sometimes

00:26:10.502 --> 00:26:13.430
don't know who's really speaking
in one of these Faulkner novels,

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.449
you don't because his
characters consciousness are

00:26:16.449 --> 00:26:19.819
sort of blended,
and their individuality has

00:26:19.819 --> 00:26:20.880
been eroded.
 

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.140
This is what I'm suggesting is
happening here in Don Quixote

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.183
and Sancho, and why this
argument is one that Don Quixote

00:26:29.183 --> 00:26:31.640
could have had within himself.
 

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.207
Now, this discussion also
brings up Don Quixote's

00:26:36.207 --> 00:26:41.058
knowledge of classical Rome and
its architecture.

00:26:41.058 --> 00:26:44.589
Rome is the city par
excellence in the

00:26:44.589 --> 00:26:48.603
Renaissance, and its
architecture was the model for

00:26:48.603 --> 00:26:50.769
Renaissance architects.
 

00:26:50.769 --> 00:26:56.942
This shows--remember that
Cervantes spent quite a bit of

00:26:56.942 --> 00:27:00.622
time in Italy,
so when he speaks of Rome,

00:27:00.622 --> 00:27:04.167
he's speaking not only of
things he has read about in

00:27:04.167 --> 00:27:06.240
books,
but also things that he has

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:06.548
seen.
 

00:27:06.548 --> 00:27:11.278
Now, this shows that Don
Quixote is a humanist,

00:27:11.278 --> 00:27:16.519
that he has read beyond the
romances of chivalry.

00:27:16.519 --> 00:27:19.920
In Part II, we are beginning to
enlarge Don Quixote's library,

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.548
we cannot reduce it to the
romances of chivalry that we

00:27:24.548 --> 00:27:30.119
found with the barber and priest
in the scrutiny of the books,

00:27:30.119 --> 00:27:31.828
but he had read other things.
 

00:27:31.828 --> 00:27:40.288
It also anticipates Part II's
projection beyond Spain.

00:27:40.288 --> 00:27:44.318
I say beyond Spain because as
Don Quixote and Sancho go to

00:27:44.318 --> 00:27:48.702
Barcelona they are moving to a
part of Spain that is almost not

00:27:48.702 --> 00:27:49.410
Spain.
 

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:54.220
Cataluña,
being, even today,

00:27:54.220 --> 00:28:00.394
a part of Spain that is very
independent in its culture and

00:28:00.394 --> 00:28:03.811
has,
in fact, tried to become

00:28:03.811 --> 00:28:08.477
independent several times,
and also, of course,

00:28:08.477 --> 00:28:12.962
the battles that you will see
at the end of the book beyond

00:28:12.962 --> 00:28:17.505
the shores of Barcelona,
move beyond the borders of

00:28:17.505 --> 00:28:22.438
Spain, so this projection
towards Italy is important in

00:28:22.438 --> 00:28:23.900
that respect.
 

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.992
But also this discussion points
out that architecture is an

00:28:28.992 --> 00:28:31.538
important issue in Part II.
 

00:28:31.538 --> 00:28:36.227
It's an important issue
because, as I have mentioned

00:28:36.227 --> 00:28:41.190
before, a great deal of Part II
takes place indoors;

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.900
in houses, in mansions and so
forth.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:50.130
In Part II, we have less,
although there are some,

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:57.961
of those two places that I
mentioned in Part I:

00:28:57.961 --> 00:29:03.955
the despoblado,
the unpopulated--Remember that

00:29:03.955 --> 00:29:09.346
that is even a legal concept,
that area where the law does

00:29:09.346 --> 00:29:13.835
not reach--
and the other one that I didn't

00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:17.133
put on the board,
but you must have seen the word

00:29:17.133 --> 00:29:19.338
many times,
these are the soledades.

00:29:19.338 --> 00:29:27.538
Soledades are when you
are out in the wild.

00:29:27.538 --> 00:29:33.730
There's less of this in Part II
and more of shelter,

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:37.643
more of architecture,
and this is why the discussion

00:29:37.643 --> 00:29:40.558
on roman architecture is
important,

00:29:40.558 --> 00:29:44.618
above all, in the context of
humanism,

00:29:44.618 --> 00:29:48.467
and the Renaissance,
and the copying of Rome's

00:29:48.467 --> 00:29:51.381
architecture and the,
of course, the development of

00:29:51.381 --> 00:29:52.568
what will become Baroque
architecture,

00:29:52.568 --> 00:29:56.150
and that scheme that I gave you
about Beinecke Plaza,

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:58.652
Sterling Memorial;
you blend them,

00:29:58.652 --> 00:30:01.750
force them together and you get
the Baroque.

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:09.721
Now, this emphasis on cities
brings us to the entry into El

00:30:09.721 --> 00:30:10.960
Toboso.
 

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:18.019
The third sally takes place at
night,

00:30:18.019 --> 00:30:23.125
and a day goes by,
and then, at night they enter

00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:26.930
the town,
the village of El Toboso,

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:31.798
and being at night,
this anticipates much of the

00:30:31.798 --> 00:30:33.480
mood of Part II.
 

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.420
Remember, Part I began at dawn.
 

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:42.505
Don Quixote and Sancho want to
arrive in the town at night so

00:30:42.505 --> 00:30:47.378
as not to be noticed,
and that night is called in the

00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:50.368
Spanish una noche
entreclara,

00:30:50.368 --> 00:30:54.438
"a night that was not
quite a dark one"

00:30:54.438 --> 00:30:57.913
says Jarvis,
and this, I underlined because

00:30:57.913 --> 00:31:00.997
of the concept of
chiaroscuro that I

00:31:00.997 --> 00:31:04.866
mentioned before,
the concept of

00:31:04.866 --> 00:31:14.009
chiaroscuro as something
proper to the Baroque.

00:31:14.009 --> 00:31:17.980
"Una noche
entreclara."

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.817
There is darkness,
sounds, dogs barking,

00:31:22.817 --> 00:31:26.457
donkeys braying,
swine grunting,

00:31:26.457 --> 00:31:29.910
cats meowing,
a plough being dragged,

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:36.019
there is an eeriness to this
town augmented by these sounds.

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:41.094
The farmhand they meet is
singing a song about a great

00:31:41.094 --> 00:31:45.690
defeat which adds to the omens,
the bad omens.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.608
Sounds, as opposed to visual
signs, appear before them.

00:31:49.608 --> 00:31:53.961
In Part I we had the fulling
hammers, but in Part II there

00:31:53.961 --> 00:31:57.318
will be many more sounds,
as you will see.

00:31:57.318 --> 00:32:01.298
These sounds here are scary by
virtue of the fact that you

00:32:01.298 --> 00:32:04.440
cannot see their source,
you can only hear.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.359
Seeing is going to be a
different problem in Part II

00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:09.480
because of the increasing
darkness.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.963
This is the first time that Don
Quixote and Sancho come into a

00:32:14.963 --> 00:32:19.640
town and it anticipates the
entry into Barcelona,

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.858
a city, a great city,
towards the end of the novel.

00:32:21.858 --> 00:32:23.890
What is the significance of
this?

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:27.009
I have mentioned this,
the novel, which develops from

00:32:27.009 --> 00:32:30.395
the Quixote,
will be for the most part an

00:32:30.395 --> 00:32:33.803
urban genre,
a genre often about cities,

00:32:33.803 --> 00:32:38.036
modern cities,
and Don Quixote's influence on

00:32:38.036 --> 00:32:42.842
the history of the novel
includes this urban part of

00:32:42.842 --> 00:32:46.590
the Quixote,
particularly as you will see

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.848
when you get to the Barcelona
chapters.

00:32:48.848 --> 00:32:53.563
Here, El Toboso appears as a
haunted city with blind allies

00:32:53.563 --> 00:32:56.651
and peopled by strangers,
the farmhand,

00:32:56.651 --> 00:32:59.740
who do not know anything about
it.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.460
The farmhand is an outsider who
cannot give them directions.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:08.317
I have always been puzzled and
sort of even scared by this

00:33:08.317 --> 00:33:13.518
farmhand in the middle of night
who doesn't even know where he

00:33:13.518 --> 00:33:15.355
is,
and I think I know why,

00:33:15.355 --> 00:33:17.464
and if you will allow me a
little anecdote:

00:33:17.464 --> 00:33:20.380
I was lost in the Pennsylvania
turnpike at night once,

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:24.318
trying to find a town
improbably called Indiana,

00:33:24.318 --> 00:33:26.670
Pennsylvania,
where I was giving a lecture.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:30.172
I got off the turnpike and I
was lost, in little towns,

00:33:30.172 --> 00:33:32.895
in Pennsylvania,
they were dark with little

00:33:32.895 --> 00:33:33.608
lights.
 

00:33:33.608 --> 00:33:37.818
I drove my rented car towards
the sidewalk,

00:33:37.818 --> 00:33:41.095
because I saw a man coming,
I lowered the window and I

00:33:41.095 --> 00:33:42.836
said,
"Could you tell me how to

00:33:42.836 --> 00:33:44.539
get to the turnpike,"
and he went,

00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:48.220
"I'm deaf. I'm deaf."
 

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.118
I said, "Oh God,
he's deaf,

00:33:50.118 --> 00:33:51.630
he can't help me,"
I raised the window,

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.730
and I followed,
and I found a little gas

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.779
station with one little light
bulb,

00:33:55.779 --> 00:33:59.758
and I got out of the car,
and this guy came out with only

00:33:59.758 --> 00:34:02.650
one eye,
he had a hole on the other side;

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:06.140
I said, this guy can't help me,
and so I was lost for hours,

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.599
they were about to send for the
National Guard,

00:34:09.599 --> 00:34:14.139
I finally found Indiana of
Pennsylvania,

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:18.260
where I was lodged in a Holiday
Inn with a Mexican motif,

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.329
and I was given the Taco Room.
 

00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:24.701
So this is my anecdote,
and this is what brings to mind

00:34:24.701 --> 00:34:29.882
this farmhand who appears in the
middle of the night and can't be

00:34:29.882 --> 00:34:33.849
of any help because he doesn't
know anything;

00:34:33.849 --> 00:34:36.170
he's not from there.
 

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:44.429
So there are deep resonances,
to me,

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:49.362
of Spanish mysticism in this
dark, night of the soul to echo

00:34:49.362 --> 00:34:54.090
Saint John of the Cross,
the great Spanish mystic poet;

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:58.436
it's the name of one of his
great poems, "Noche oscura

00:34:58.436 --> 00:34:59.710
del alma."
 

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:08.260
It recalls seeing the depths of
the soul in the darkness of

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.440
night.
 

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:15.639
Sancho is actually looking for
a memory that is a lie,

00:35:15.639 --> 00:35:21.068
the story he made up about
going to El Toboso remembering

00:35:21.068 --> 00:35:25.139
something that he knows does not
exist,

00:35:25.139 --> 00:35:28.103
he's trying to remember
something that he knows does not

00:35:28.103 --> 00:35:30.219
exist,
it's a made up memory,

00:35:30.219 --> 00:35:34.668
and Don Quixote is looking for
a non-existent lady who is the

00:35:34.668 --> 00:35:38.672
object of his devotion:
both protagonists are searching

00:35:38.672 --> 00:35:41.860
for intangibles in the dark of
night,

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:46.090
as if it were,
within their troubled spirits,

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:49.599
and this is the,
I think, the impression,

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:53.210
that this El Toboso at night
conveys.

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:59.029
Right away we come upon a line
that has inspired much useless

00:35:59.029 --> 00:36:02.800
commentary;
when looking for Dulcinea they

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.559
run into the church.
 

00:36:04.559 --> 00:36:10.565
The line in Spanish reads:
"Con la iglesia hemos

00:36:10.565 --> 00:36:12.570
dado,
Sancho,"

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:16.063
Jarvis translates:
"We are come to the

00:36:16.063 --> 00:36:18.059
church, Sancho."
 

00:36:18.059 --> 00:36:23.699
Modern readers have seen in
that sentence a hidden meaning,

00:36:23.699 --> 00:36:26.739
that is, that Cervantes is
decrying the interference of the

00:36:26.739 --> 00:36:29.436
church in all affairs,
and the line has even become a

00:36:29.436 --> 00:36:32.163
standard phrase in Spanish to
say that you have come against

00:36:32.163 --> 00:36:34.150
some obstacle:
"con la iglesia hemos

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.858
dado,
Sancho,"

00:36:35.858 --> 00:36:38.539
when you come against some
obstacle,

00:36:38.539 --> 00:36:41.949
particularly when you are
denied something or other.

00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:45.692
I think that is only because of
the rhythm of the way the

00:36:45.692 --> 00:36:48.472
sentence is written,
not "hemos dado con la

00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:50.628
iglesia, Sancho"
but "con la iglesia

00:36:50.628 --> 00:36:51.889
hemos dado,
Sancho,"

00:36:51.889 --> 00:36:53.659
but it doesn't have anything to
do with that,

00:36:53.659 --> 00:36:55.460
this is why I mean that it is
useless,

00:36:55.460 --> 00:37:00.315
but it has remained in the
Spanish language as a ready made

00:37:00.315 --> 00:37:01.070
phrase.
 

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:04.452
I think that what is
significant here is that

00:37:04.452 --> 00:37:08.219
Dulcinea's castle has morphed
into the church,

00:37:08.219 --> 00:37:12.797
that in looking in the dark for
Dulcinea's castle they have

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:15.152
found a church,
or the church,

00:37:15.152 --> 00:37:17.952
in the gloom,
where things are difficult to

00:37:17.952 --> 00:37:20.152
identify,
Sancho is scared because he

00:37:20.152 --> 00:37:22.518
knows that the cemeteries are
around churches,

00:37:22.518 --> 00:37:24.949
and he doesn't want to be in a
cemetery at night.

00:37:24.949 --> 00:37:27.469
This could be a telling
transformation,

00:37:27.469 --> 00:37:31.327
perhaps an indication that Don
Quixote's love is a kind of

00:37:31.327 --> 00:37:33.315
religion,
or more likely,

00:37:33.315 --> 00:37:37.469
given what will happen over and
again in Part II is an

00:37:37.469 --> 00:37:41.860
intimation of death of which
there are many in this eerie

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.880
chapter.
 

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:49.019
This ghostly night in El
Toboso, the first adventure in

00:37:49.019 --> 00:37:54.820
Part II, sets the tone for the
rest of the novel.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:38:00.407
So now we move to the chapter,
we're not going to go through

00:38:00.407 --> 00:38:03.829
every single chapter,
as I've mentioned before,

00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:05.989
but here we move to a very
important chapter,

00:38:05.989 --> 00:38:09.420
the one on the enchanted
Dulcinea.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.360
It's important not only because
it inspired Auerbach's famous

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.119
essay of "The Enchanted
Dulcinea"

00:38:16.119 --> 00:38:20.360
that you will be reading,
but also it is a chapter that

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.179
will play an important role
later,

00:38:23.179 --> 00:38:28.070
in one of the most important
episodes of Part II,

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.327
one of the whole
Quixote,

00:38:29.327 --> 00:38:30.989
the episode of the cave of
Montesinos,

00:38:30.989 --> 00:38:34.570
where this enchanted Dulcinea
will come back.

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:39.411
So, first of all,
it is one episode in which we

00:38:39.411 --> 00:38:43.726
notice, once again,
but very dramatically,

00:38:43.726 --> 00:38:49.619
an exchange of roles between
Don Quixote and Sancho.

00:38:49.619 --> 00:38:54.371
The first time was when Sancho
played the role of Don Quixote

00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:57.847
to his wife,
who was playing his own role in

00:38:57.847 --> 00:39:00.800
that hilarious dialogue that
they had,

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:07.400
but here the exchange of roles
is much more dramatic.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:13.657
The first thing to notice is
Sancho's Shakespearean monologue

00:39:13.657 --> 00:39:18.873
that dramatizes his inner
conflicts and reveals his

00:39:18.873 --> 00:39:22.630
apprehensions about Don Quixote.
 

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:25.110
He doesn't know quite what to
do;

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:30.088
Sancho is here like a rustic
Hamlet: "to be or not to

00:39:30.088 --> 00:39:31.050
be."
 

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:37.547
He weighs the various options
that he has, and he opts for

00:39:37.547 --> 00:39:43.931
trying to fool Don Quixote with
the trick of turning this

00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:47.579
peasant woman into Dulcinea.
 

00:39:47.579 --> 00:39:51.840
Sancho is becoming a fuller
character and increasingly

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.849
important to the novel.
 

00:39:53.849 --> 00:39:57.190
He is one of the pranksters who
fool Don Quixote.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:00.789
He will be, in this sense,
like Sansón Carrasco and

00:40:00.789 --> 00:40:03.820
like the Duke's steward who will
appear later.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:08.471
Also, Sancho is separated from
his master here as when he went

00:40:08.471 --> 00:40:12.740
to deliver the letter in Part I,
but this prefigures several

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:16.300
important episodes in Part II in
which they are separated,

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:21.289
and Sancho plays the role of
the protagonist of his own part.

00:40:21.289 --> 00:40:26.010
But the most important thing
about this Shakespearean

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:28.063
monologue,
as I call it,

00:40:28.063 --> 00:40:31.690
is that we are exposed here to
Sancho's inner world,

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.139
his world of doubts.
 

00:40:33.139 --> 00:40:36.623
Then, of course,
there is inversion of roles:

00:40:36.623 --> 00:40:41.059
Sancho is the one trying to
convince his master that what

00:40:41.059 --> 00:40:44.070
they see is not really a
reality,

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:46.190
but something drawn from the
chivalric romances,

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:49.833
and he does a pretty good
imitation of Don Quixote's own

00:40:49.833 --> 00:40:54.139
rhetoric in trying to convince
him that this wench is Dulcinea.

00:40:54.139 --> 00:40:58.273
So reality, which Don Quixote
perceives as it is,

00:40:58.273 --> 00:41:03.268
conspires spontaneously or
arranged by someone to appear as

00:41:03.268 --> 00:41:06.110
unreal, literary,
artificial.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:10.597
Hence, the episode depends on
the memory of Part I and of

00:41:10.597 --> 00:41:12.119
similar episodes.
 

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:15.346
Here, I think,
that the episode in the

00:41:15.346 --> 00:41:18.659
background is that of the
windmills;

00:41:18.659 --> 00:41:20.199
it's that inversion.
 

00:41:20.199 --> 00:41:23.010
It is here Don Quixote who
says: what giants?

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.440
Where is Dulcinea?
 

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.840
What do you mean, Dulcinea?
 

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.699
That is the episode in the
background here.

00:41:30.699 --> 00:41:35.666
Now, the peasant lass reacts to
Sancho's rhetoric a little bit

00:41:35.666 --> 00:41:40.471
like the prostitutes in the
first inn when they react to Don

00:41:40.471 --> 00:41:43.829
Quixote,
though the prostitutes in the

00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:48.585
first inn were kinder to Don
Quixote than these peasant women

00:41:48.585 --> 00:41:51.594
here,
who are very upset because they

00:41:51.594 --> 00:41:56.329
think that upper class young man
or men are making fun of them.

00:41:56.329 --> 00:42:01.230
This is really a truly
hilarious episode,

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:05.250
one that makes me laugh,
as I said the last time,

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:08.878
every time I reread it,
particularly the part about

00:42:08.878 --> 00:42:15.150
Dulcinea smelling of garlic,
which I will mention again.

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:21.860
But there is also the issue of
Dulcinea's bodily hair,

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:29.460
specifically in Don Quixote's
interpretation Dulcinea's pubic

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.599
hair.
 

00:42:30.599 --> 00:42:44.539
If we go to page 530,531,
Sancho is talking and he says:

00:42:44.539 --> 00:42:51.014
"...by which we might have
guessed at what was hid beneath

00:42:51.014 --> 00:42:56.235
that coarse disguise [he's
talking about her body]:

00:42:56.235 --> 00:42:58.471
though,
to say the truth,

00:42:58.471 --> 00:43:01.300
to me she did not appear in the
least deformed,

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.969
but rather all beauty,
and that increased too by a

00:43:04.969 --> 00:43:09.041
mole she had on her right lip,
like a whisker,

00:43:09.041 --> 00:43:12.670
with seven or eight hairs on
it,

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:16.771
like threads of gold,
and above a span long [long

00:43:16.771 --> 00:43:17.539
hairs].
 

00:43:17.539 --> 00:43:21.958
'As to that mole' [this is the
pedantic answer by Don Quixote]

00:43:21.958 --> 00:43:25.434
'according to the
correspondence there is between

00:43:25.434 --> 00:43:29.996
the moles of the face and those
of the body Dulcinea should have

00:43:29.996 --> 00:43:33.981
another on the brawn of her
thigh [the inner part of her

00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:38.684
thigh],
on the same side with that on

00:43:38.684 --> 00:43:41.951
her face,
but hairs of the length you

00:43:41.951 --> 00:43:45.510
mentioned are somewhat of the
longest for moles.'

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.909
'Yes I can assure your
worship,' answered Sancho,

00:43:47.909 --> 00:43:50.510
'that there they were,
and looked as if they had been

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:51.460
born with her.'
 

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.478
'I believe it,
friend,' said Don Quixote,

00:43:54.478 --> 00:43:58.702
'for nature has placed nothing
about Dulcinea but what is

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:01.795
finished and perfect;
and therefore,

00:44:01.795 --> 00:44:05.934
had she a hundred moles,
like those you speak of,

00:44:05.934 --> 00:44:10.762
in her they would not be moles,
but moons and resplendent

00:44:10.762 --> 00:44:15.697
stars.'"
The description is remindful,

00:44:15.697 --> 00:44:22.063
of course, of Maritornes,
but there is something specific

00:44:22.063 --> 00:44:25.018
about a hairy Dulcinea.
 

00:44:25.018 --> 00:44:28.199
Bodily hair,
a lot of hair,

00:44:28.199 --> 00:44:35.172
was taken then as an indication
of a heightened sexuality,

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:38.719
of a strong sexual drive.
 

00:44:38.719 --> 00:44:41.570
This and other hints,
there will be other hints,

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.750
and there have been others--you
can look them up in my book,

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.099
Love and the Law in
Cervantes--

00:44:46.099 --> 00:44:49.820
of bodily hair on Dulcinea and
other women,

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:53.018
moustaches and so forth.
 

00:44:53.018 --> 00:44:55.050
Look for them now,
as you read the book and

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.659
believe me, they are there,
I haven't invented them.

00:44:57.659 --> 00:45:03.358
These and other hints reveal a
story behind the story here that

00:45:03.358 --> 00:45:05.750
I have hinted at before.
 

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:10.233
What lurks beneath Don
Quixote's courtly love style for

00:45:10.233 --> 00:45:15.547
Dulcinea is the sexual desire of
an aristocrat for a peasant lass

00:45:15.547 --> 00:45:18.869
presumed to be of ardent
sexuality,

00:45:18.869 --> 00:45:23.860
who promises to provide more
pleasure than the women of his

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:24.550
class.
 

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:28.943
There is a literary tradition
behind this that reaches back to

00:45:28.943 --> 00:45:32.619
the Spanish ballads,
but that is also quite alive in

00:45:32.619 --> 00:45:34.059
Cervantes' time.
 

00:45:34.059 --> 00:45:38.059
At least two of Don Juan's
conquests--

00:45:38.059 --> 00:45:41.000
you know who Don Juan is the
figure of Don Juan,

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.606
the womanizer and so forth,
who first appeared in Tirso de

00:45:44.606 --> 00:45:45.619
Molina's play.
 

00:45:45.619 --> 00:45:48.788
I have mentioned the fact that
the Don Juan figure is one of

00:45:48.788 --> 00:45:51.795
the figures created in the
Spanish Golden age by Tirso de

00:45:51.795 --> 00:45:54.239
Molina,
I better put his name on, too.

00:45:54.239 --> 00:45:59.849
He is the inventor of the Don
Juan figure,

00:45:59.849 --> 00:46:07.333
a great legacy then,
in literature and music and so

00:46:07.333 --> 00:46:10.012
forth--
At least two of Don Juan's

00:46:10.012 --> 00:46:11.960
conquests in Tirso de Molina's
play,

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.860
The Trickster of Seville
are from the lower classes,

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.000
one a peasant and the other a
fisher woman.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.625
The Dulcinea in this scene also
underscores her physical prowess

00:46:22.625 --> 00:46:25.840
by the way she mounts her
donkey,

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:31.510
by taking a little run back to
get some momentum,

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:34.300
and leaping on it from behind
and riding it astride,

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:35.719
like a man.
 

00:46:35.719 --> 00:46:39.099
It's a very sexual and vulgar
gesture that she makes that I

00:46:39.099 --> 00:46:42.057
find absolutely hilarious,
and then when Sancho says,

00:46:42.057 --> 00:46:43.646
"my God,
she's quite a horseman,

00:46:43.646 --> 00:46:45.809
she could teach a Cordovan or a
Mexican to ride a horse,

00:46:45.809 --> 00:46:50.000
the way she leaps on it,"
and she just goes on.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.851
Also by her smell of raw
garlic, which Jarvis translates

00:46:55.851 --> 00:47:01.809
as 'undigested garlic,' which
reveals her coarseness,

00:47:01.809 --> 00:47:07.409
and also her proximity to food:
food and sex go together.

00:47:07.409 --> 00:47:09.893
Now, I know,
that, of course,

00:47:09.893 --> 00:47:14.860
garlic doesn't sound very sexy
to anybody anymore or ever

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:18.409
perhaps, but this is the
intimation.

00:47:18.409 --> 00:47:22.005
The whole transformation of
Dulcinea will leave a deep

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:24.447
imprint in the knight's
subconscious,

00:47:24.447 --> 00:47:28.179
as we shall see in the episode
of Montesinos' cave.

00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:33.608
But now Don Quixote and Sancho
are about to meet theater on the

00:47:33.608 --> 00:47:36.135
road,
this road that in Part II

00:47:36.135 --> 00:47:39.324
appears to be full,
not of real characters,

00:47:39.324 --> 00:47:43.425
as of characters and objects
playing roles or disguised as

00:47:43.425 --> 00:47:46.518
something else other than what
they are.

00:47:46.518 --> 00:47:50.969
So they meet now,
the cart of the parliament of

00:47:50.969 --> 00:47:54.045
death,
which is a cart carrying actors

00:47:54.045 --> 00:47:58.027
who have finished putting on a
play in one town and go to

00:47:58.027 --> 00:48:01.230
another nearby to repeat the
performance,

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:04.690
hence, they have not changed
out of their costumes.

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:08.373
The play that they stage is a
kind that you have already met

00:48:08.373 --> 00:48:11.871
before, though very briefly,
in the Grisóstomo and

00:48:11.871 --> 00:48:13.119
Marcela episode.
 

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:17.041
If you remember that episode,
Grisóstomo was said to

00:48:17.041 --> 00:48:19.679
write the autos
sacramentales.

00:48:19.679 --> 00:48:42.909
These are the religious plays
performed on the day of Corpus

00:48:42.909 --> 00:48:49.097
Christi,
the feast in honor of the

00:48:49.097 --> 00:48:53.034
Eucharist or communion
celebrated on a Thursday on the

00:48:53.034 --> 00:48:55.190
sixtieth day after Easter.
 

00:48:55.190 --> 00:49:03.119
Therefore, it's coherent with
the chronology of the novel,

00:49:03.119 --> 00:49:07.690
it's taking place in summer so
Corpus Christi,

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:14.355
communion, the Eucharist,
is celebrated in this feast

00:49:14.355 --> 00:49:17.909
every year,
and part of the feast was the

00:49:17.909 --> 00:49:22.500
performance of this place,
which always deal with the

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:28.181
topic of the Eucharist,
the mystery of the Eucharist,

00:49:28.181 --> 00:49:32.786
the transformation of Christ's
body into blood,

00:49:32.786 --> 00:49:35.489
and into wine and bread.
 

00:49:35.489 --> 00:49:39.760
They usually have plots drawn
from scripture,

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:44.420
but also plots drawn from
classical mythology.

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.480
These autos were a
medieval retention in every

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.873
sense,
and now think about what I said

00:49:49.873 --> 00:49:52.880
about the Baroque going back to
the Middle Ages,

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.619
jumping over,
back over the Renaissance,

00:49:55.619 --> 00:49:59.050
this is a medieval retention,
the auto sacramental.

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:02.130
They were one-act plays
performed on carts,

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:03.010
precisely.
 

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:07.271
They are carrying themselves on
the cart and they are also

00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:09.197
carrying,
with the cart,

00:50:09.197 --> 00:50:14.039
the stage, because the way that
these autos were performed were,

00:50:14.039 --> 00:50:21.369
if you have a town square,
let's say the church is here,

00:50:21.369 --> 00:50:27.909
the other buildings and so
forth, the carts were put,

00:50:27.909 --> 00:50:32.690
one--if there were two or
three--one for each scene,

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:36.539
and then the people would be
here, and the performance took

00:50:36.539 --> 00:50:44.567
place on the carts,
and elaborate props and scenery

00:50:44.567 --> 00:50:53.222
were created on the carts,
because these plays represented

00:50:53.222 --> 00:50:56.800
cosmic events of the world,
I mean the universe,

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.117
the stars, and so forth,
would appear,

00:50:59.117 --> 00:51:01.980
and then when the play was
finished--

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.489
this was a very modest play
with only one cart--

00:51:04.489 --> 00:51:06.679
the cart would move on to the
next town.

00:51:06.679 --> 00:51:10.092
So they were carrying with them
their stage, not only

00:51:10.092 --> 00:51:12.389
themselves, but also their
stage.

00:51:12.389 --> 00:51:17.398
They were simple enough so that
all of the people could

00:51:17.398 --> 00:51:20.737
understand them,
but sophisticated in

00:51:20.737 --> 00:51:24.170
versification,
imagery and theological

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:25.469
content.
 

00:51:25.469 --> 00:51:29.259
Calderón de la Barca was
the most famous author of

00:51:29.259 --> 00:51:33.032
autos sacramentales,
but many other poets and

00:51:33.032 --> 00:51:36.056
playwrights wrote them,
including Lope de Vega,

00:51:36.056 --> 00:51:39.099
who was the author of the one
mentioned in this episode,

00:51:39.099 --> 00:51:44.108
Las cortes de la Muerte,
which is a real one-act play by

00:51:44.108 --> 00:51:49.038
Lope de Vega translated here as
The Courts or Parliament of

00:51:49.038 --> 00:51:50.170
Death.
 

00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:53.300
In the play,
Man, with a capital M--

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.340
remember it is an allegorical
play--

00:51:55.340 --> 00:52:00.967
is subjected to a trial after
having been tempted by the

00:52:00.967 --> 00:52:03.440
devil--
this is where the devil appears

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:03.739
here.
 

00:52:03.739 --> 00:52:08.347
Another figure is that of
Madness, represented by the

00:52:08.347 --> 00:52:13.400
actor who spooks Rocinante with
his bells and bladders.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.351
Remember, this one who comes
after they have had their

00:52:16.351 --> 00:52:19.407
dialogue,
and he has a stick with--they

00:52:19.407 --> 00:52:24.588
didn't have balloons because,
of course, there was no plastic

00:52:24.588 --> 00:52:26.976
to make them,
so they made these balloons out

00:52:26.976 --> 00:52:28.239
of the bladders of slain
animals,

00:52:28.239 --> 00:52:33.268
so bladders and bells,
and he plays Madness.

00:52:33.268 --> 00:52:37.652
The most famous of these autos
was one by Calderón

00:52:37.652 --> 00:52:41.409
called The Great Theater of
the World,

00:52:41.409 --> 00:52:46.141
whose theme was that of the
world as a stage where man

00:52:46.141 --> 00:52:49.279
performs life,
as if it were a play,

00:52:49.279 --> 00:52:53.673
before going on to the real
life after death at the end of

00:52:53.673 --> 00:52:54.599
the play.
 

00:52:54.599 --> 00:52:58.788
The one performed by these
players in this episode of

00:52:58.788 --> 00:53:01.708
the Quixote,
who, by the way,

00:53:01.708 --> 00:53:04.869
were a real company of actors
of the time,

00:53:04.869 --> 00:53:09.480
is very much along the lines of
The Great Theater of the

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:14.329
World, but the conceit here
is that of a trial for man.

00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:18.489
So this is what it is in the
background of this scene.

00:53:18.489 --> 00:53:23.786
So theatricality is an
important element in Part II

00:53:23.786 --> 00:53:29.106
because of what I mentioned,
theatricality is part of the

00:53:29.106 --> 00:53:32.889
deceit that would lead to
desengaño,

00:53:32.889 --> 00:53:35.730
but it's also--you will also
find it at the inn,

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:38.679
where Ginés de Pasamonte
appears as a puppet master.

00:53:38.679 --> 00:53:45.420
Death, who appears here as part
of the ensemble of actors--

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.449
because Death was an
allegorical figure that appeared

00:53:47.449 --> 00:53:50.985
in this--
is also important in Part II,

00:53:50.985 --> 00:53:57.099
and it is a medieval retention,
so is the devil.

00:53:57.099 --> 00:54:00.257
Everyone here is in costume,
including, of course,

00:54:00.257 --> 00:54:01.159
Don Quixote.
 

00:54:01.159 --> 00:54:05.309
Reality is all ready play,
illusion;

00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:08.130
there is no need for Don
Quixote to misinterpret it.

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:12.076
But notice the subtlety that
the plays then assume their

00:54:12.076 --> 00:54:13.440
roles in reality.
 

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:18.855
The Madness begins to play
Madness in the reality of Don

00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:19.840
Quixote.
 

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:27.771
The devil plays a trick on
Sancho, and the presence of

00:54:27.771 --> 00:54:30.880
death,
even in allegorical dress is

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:34.643
frightening,
and reality is buried beneath a

00:54:34.643 --> 00:54:38.550
layer of various forms of
representation.

00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:41.588
A man dressed as a literary
character meets men and women

00:54:41.588 --> 00:54:43.380
dressed as literary characters.
 

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:48.500
The devil who steals Sancho's
donkey parodies Don Quixote and

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.719
his fall from Rocinante.
 

00:54:50.719 --> 00:54:54.570
Here is a madman facing an
actor playing the role of

00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:59.025
madness, as if reality were
offering Don Quixote a mirror of

00:54:59.025 --> 00:55:00.989
his own deranged self.
 

00:55:00.989 --> 00:55:04.458
This is something that will
happen over and again in Part

00:55:04.458 --> 00:55:07.371
II,
and we will find another

00:55:07.371 --> 00:55:11.230
example very soon,
when Don Quixote meets the

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:12.768
Knight of the Mirrors.
 

00:55:12.768 --> 00:55:15.876
Life is play acting,
as Don Quixote says,

00:55:15.876 --> 00:55:19.449
using a word that you are now
familiar with.

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:22.985
He says: "Y ahora digo
que es menester tocar las

00:55:22.985 --> 00:55:25.556
apariencias con la mano para dar
lugar al

00:55:25.556 --> 00:55:27.550
desengaño."
 

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:29.320
That's what is says in the
original.

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.090
And Jarvis does reasonably well.
 

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:34.342
He says: "And I say now
that it is absolutely necessary

00:55:34.342 --> 00:55:36.768
[says Don Quixote]
if one would be undeceived

00:55:36.768 --> 00:55:39.306
[desengaño]
to lay one hands upon

00:55:39.306 --> 00:55:42.559
appearances [to see that they
are appearances]."

00:55:42.559 --> 00:55:45.121
Cervantes, by the way,
is punning here,

00:55:45.121 --> 00:55:48.358
because in the Spanish of the
seventeenth century

00:55:48.358 --> 00:55:51.730
'apariencias' also meant
'stage props.'

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:55.938
When Calderón wrote the
instructions for the carpenters

00:55:55.938 --> 00:55:59.525
to make the stage he called
those "Memoria de

00:55:59.525 --> 00:56:03.389
apariencias,"
apariencias were stage props.

00:56:03.389 --> 00:56:07.693
So by this pun Cervantes is
underlining the theatrical

00:56:07.693 --> 00:56:11.510
quality of this episode and of
the quote unquote

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:13.460
"reality."
 

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:18.047
Two things important to remark
and remember for this scene is

00:56:18.047 --> 00:56:21.869
that Don Quixote meets an image
of his madness,

00:56:21.869 --> 00:56:25.039
something that will happen
throughout Part II,

00:56:25.039 --> 00:56:28.800
and it is kind of a point of
madness,

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.079
where madness reflects madness,
nadness for us,

00:56:32.079 --> 00:56:33.110
as readers, too.
 

00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:36.177
And also, we must remember the
presence of death,

00:56:36.177 --> 00:56:39.820
which is a warning against the
deceits offered by life.

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:44.427
Death devalues all of the
allures of life with its

00:56:44.427 --> 00:56:49.786
presence, and we have met it
before in El Toboso when they

00:56:49.786 --> 00:56:52.420
bump against the church.
 

00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:58.389
Finally, the loop of the story
here,

00:56:58.389 --> 00:57:01.610
of this little story,
of this episode goes from

00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:04.769
deceit to disillusionment,
from engaño to

00:57:04.769 --> 00:57:05.780
desengaño.
 

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:09.829
If Micomicona and the process
by which her story was concocted

00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:12.949
was like a representation of
representation,

00:57:12.949 --> 00:57:17.219
the episode of the cart of the
parliament of death is

00:57:17.219 --> 00:57:23.532
representation in motion,
or actually representation even

00:57:23.532 --> 00:57:26.900
on wheels, one could say.
 

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:31.233
I want to close by reading you
a little vignette that I wrote,

00:57:31.233 --> 00:57:33.579
as an epilogue to this episode.
 

00:57:33.579 --> 00:57:38.661
I've told you that professors
and critics can hardly resist

00:57:38.661 --> 00:57:43.920
the temptation of crossing the
line and becoming writers,

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:49.659
and this is my very modest
falling into that trap.

00:57:49.659 --> 00:57:53.380
It goes like this,
it's very brief and very silly

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:57.101
now as I reread it,
but I think that it will give

00:57:57.101 --> 00:57:59.746
you a laugh:
"Satisfied,

00:57:59.746 --> 00:58:04.304
after recovering Sancho's
donkey from the wild devil who

00:58:04.304 --> 00:58:09.362
had stolen it in jest to mock
Don Quixote our pair got back on

00:58:09.362 --> 00:58:13.010
the road on their journey to
Saragossa.

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:16.579
They had not traveled very much
when they saw in the distance a

00:58:16.579 --> 00:58:19.844
cloud of dust,
picked up by what seemed like a

00:58:19.844 --> 00:58:24.014
large contingent of horsemen,
only that from afar their

00:58:24.014 --> 00:58:29.378
mounts looked enormous,
fit more for giants than for

00:58:29.378 --> 00:58:30.000
men.
 

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.230
They brought Rocinante and the
donkey to a halt,

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:37.376
shaded their eyes with their
hands and peered into the

00:58:37.376 --> 00:58:40.788
approaching murky mass,
unable to discern what it

00:58:40.788 --> 00:58:41.610
contained.
 

00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:44.702
As when he first saw the cart
with the players,

00:58:44.702 --> 00:58:47.730
Don Quixote was brimming with
anticipation.

00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:50.793
This had the makings of a
superb adventure fit for his new

00:58:50.793 --> 00:58:53.751
stature, as a knight whose
exploits had already been the

00:58:53.751 --> 00:58:54.880
object of a book.
 

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.190
As the strange contingent drew
nearer,

00:58:57.190 --> 00:59:01.277
Don Quixote and Sancho were
astonished to discover that it

00:59:01.277 --> 00:59:05.510
consisted of a brightly dressed
man in Moorish dress sitting

00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:09.239
atop a huge camel and covered by
a green canopy.

00:59:09.239 --> 00:59:13.690
He was comfortably positioned
on a lavish saddle with his legs

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:18.215
crossed, on which he cradled a
device that our heroes could not

00:59:18.215 --> 00:59:18.800
see.
 

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:23.621
Behind him rode in a splendid
dromedary a younger man dressed

00:59:23.621 --> 00:59:25.389
as a morisco.
 

00:59:25.389 --> 00:59:29.210
He too was covered by a
parasol, yellow in his case,

00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:33.032
and was in a similar position
and cradling something in a

00:59:33.032 --> 00:59:35.969
fashion similar to the man on
the front,

00:59:35.969 --> 00:59:37.530
who was obviously his master.
 

00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:40.559
They were surrounded by a troop
of men on horses,

00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:42.768
well, armed and carrying
banners.

00:59:42.768 --> 00:59:47.340
Both parties stopped and gazed
at each other in wonder.

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.869
Don Quixote was the first to
speak: 'My dear sir,

00:59:49.869 --> 00:59:52.768
would you please state your
name, nation and mission?

00:59:52.768 --> 00:59:55.469
as I suspect by your garb and
weapons that it could not be a

00:59:55.469 --> 00:59:57.940
good one, in which case,
I must challenge you to single

00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:58.489
combat.'
 

00:59:58.489 --> 01:00:01.121
The gentleman,
somewhat plump and placid in

01:00:01.121 --> 01:00:05.067
appearance did not look up from
the device on which he seemed to

01:00:05.067 --> 01:00:07.010
be tapping with both hands.
 

01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:10.737
At length, he lifted his head
and answered the knight in an

01:00:10.737 --> 01:00:14.724
incomprehensible gibberish that
the man behind on the dromedary

01:00:14.724 --> 01:00:18.646
interpreted nearly at once as
follows: 'My dear Don Quixote de

01:00:18.646 --> 01:00:22.117
la Mancha,
I am Cide Hamete Benengeli,

01:00:22.117 --> 01:00:25.639
author of your story and your
creator,

01:00:25.639 --> 01:00:29.534
and the man behind me is my
translator who is transcribing

01:00:29.534 --> 01:00:33.429
in Spanish what I write here in
this laptop in Arabic.'

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:37.650
He said this without stopping
his typing, for had he done so,

01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:41.449
the whole scene would have
vanished without a trace.

01:00:41.449 --> 01:00:45.458
Don Quixote and Sancho were
speechless and motionless,

01:00:45.458 --> 01:00:47.349
and the tapping ceased.
 

01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:51.469
Silence fell over the baron
Castilian landscape;

01:00:51.469 --> 01:00:59.440
the novel had finally and truly
come to an end."

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.067
Well, I have here a few notes
from your exams,

01:01:02.067 --> 01:01:04.518
of things that I found very
interesting.

01:01:04.518 --> 01:01:06.427
It's not everyone,
so don't be jealous if you're

01:01:06.427 --> 01:01:08.255
not mentioned,
you'll be mentioned in the next

01:01:08.255 --> 01:01:08.579
one.
 

01:01:08.579 --> 01:01:13.333
But Tony wrote about the lack
of introspection in the

01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:17.273
Quixote,
and that is true,

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:22.559
but this will change in Part
II,

01:01:22.559 --> 01:01:24.994
and he also said that
"those who like the

01:01:24.994 --> 01:01:27.699
romances of chivalry are also
like Don Quixote,

01:01:27.699 --> 01:01:30.739
and in a way,
that is extends to us."

01:01:30.739 --> 01:01:32.869
That was very good.
 

01:01:32.869 --> 01:01:36.643
Kelsey, "being an author
and the danger of insanity"

01:01:36.643 --> 01:01:38.784
she writes,
which is true:

01:01:38.784 --> 01:01:42.882
being an author,
as you can see with my little

01:01:42.882 --> 01:01:47.250
attempt here,
carries the danger of insanity.

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:51.650
And Sancho, she says "is
fat and short and therefore

01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:55.581
closer to the ground,"
I found that to be very

01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:56.840
interesting.
 

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.849
Tara, "Don Quixote doubles
Cervantes,

01:02:00.849 --> 01:02:05.353
both are readers and authors of
chivalric romances,"

01:02:05.353 --> 01:02:08.409
it is true, so I found that to
be...

01:02:08.409 --> 01:02:11.829
Jasmmyn, this is in Spanish,
"doubles who are

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:15.389
interlaced to complete,
as it were, the character of

01:02:15.389 --> 01:02:16.646
Don Quixote."
 

01:02:16.646 --> 01:02:19.090
That was very good,
I thought.

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:24.030
Ariel found various frames in
Las Meninas,

01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:25.940
it's true, the frame of the
picture,

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.800
the frame in the picture,
the frame of the door,

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.900
there is repetition of frames.
 

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.550
I found that to be a very,
very interesting insight.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.878
Elizabeth, "Cardenio makes
Don Quixote more believable as a

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:40.050
character since someone else
exists who is like him."

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:43.967
Toby, "in turning Don
Quixote's world into a world of

01:02:43.967 --> 01:02:48.159
dialogue he and Sancho both
changes it and preserves."

01:02:48.159 --> 01:02:52.280
So this is your own feedback
that I found very interesting.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.096
So I'll see you in the next
class or this Friday,

01:02:55.096 --> 01:02:58.030
I will be there,
should you want to come see me.

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:00.980
A few of you have already come
and we have had very pleasant

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.329
conversations,
and I am eager to receive you.

01:03:03.329 --> 01:03:09.000

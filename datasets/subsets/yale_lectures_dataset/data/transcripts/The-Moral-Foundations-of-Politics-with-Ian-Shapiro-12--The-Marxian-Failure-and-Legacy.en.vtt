00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.192
Prof: Okay,
this morning we're going to

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:09.446
finish talking about Marx,
and we're going to focus on the

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:13.280
failures of Marxism and the
legacies of Marxism,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.514
and the failures are connected
to the legacies in important

00:00:18.514 --> 00:00:24.200
ways that we'll unfold as we
proceed with today's discussion.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.200
I began this already on Monday
by talking about the

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.520
difficulties with Marx's
assumptions about scarcity and

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.040
superabundance.
 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.508
And we saw that just as Mill
couldn't banish politics from

00:00:39.508 --> 00:00:45.840
politics through the mechanism
of a neutral definition of harm,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.540
Marx is unable to banish
politics from politics by

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.090
somehow wishing distributive
conflict could,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.000
in principle, go away.
 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.332
We saw that that notion of
superabundance that informs his

00:01:00.332 --> 00:01:04.730
communist utopia is incoherent
in principle,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.417
and that means that
distributive conflict is endemic

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:14.379
to human society no matter how
much wealth there is.

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:18.379
And some principles for the
distribution of income and

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:22.531
wealth are going to have to be
argued about and defended

00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:26.080
regardless of what is produced
in society,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.780
or what could be produced in
society.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.879
The second failure of Marxism
is well known,

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:34.492
but we should,
nonetheless,

00:01:34.492 --> 00:01:37.277
mention it,
which is that his historical

00:01:37.277 --> 00:01:41.250
predictions turned out to be
hopelessly wide of the mark.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.428
Not only was he wrong in 1830
and 1848 when he thought that

00:01:45.428 --> 00:01:49.680
communist revolutions were about
to sweep through Europe.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.027
They were both (a) not
communist and (b) quickly

00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:56.660
reversed, in any event,
within a couple of years.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.310
His larger historical
predictions were also wrong.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.724
He thought communism would
come, socialist revolutions,

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:08.584
for reasons that you now know
because we've worked through the

00:02:08.584 --> 00:02:09.658
macro theory.
 

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:13.092
He thought that socialist
revolutions would occur in

00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:17.401
advanced capitalist systems that
had become uncompetitive because

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:20.632
of the replacement of
competitive capitalism with

00:02:20.632 --> 00:02:24.330
monopoly capitalism,
and in fact where we saw

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.480
revolutions bearing the
communist label was in peasant

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.510
societies: in Russia,
and in China,

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.964
or in Eastern Europe in
countries where it was actually

00:02:35.964 --> 00:02:40.580
more or less imposed from the
outside by the Soviet Union

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.560
after World War II.
 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.529
We didn't really see any
society go through the sort of

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:51.014
path Marx was thinking of in his
larger teleological theory of

00:02:51.014 --> 00:02:54.442
history,
namely from feudalism,

00:02:54.442 --> 00:02:58.030
to capitalism,
to socialism, to communism.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.860
It simply didn't happen.
 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.719
And as the reversals of the
revolutions of 1830 and 1848

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:12.668
remind us on a smaller scale,
Marx's bigger idea that there's

00:03:12.668 --> 00:03:17.336
some purpose or direction to
history seems questionable by

00:03:17.336 --> 00:03:21.348
the first decades of the
twenty-first century.

00:03:21.348 --> 00:03:24.520
History doesn't go in a single
direction,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.470
and this is a theme to which we
will return,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.122
but you can see movements
toward more egalitarian systems

00:03:32.122 --> 00:03:36.360
and then movements away from
egalitarian systems.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.232
You can see democracy created
and then you can see it collapse

00:03:40.232 --> 00:03:44.175
into authoritarianism,
so that there isn't a single

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:48.800
teleological or directional
focus of history of the sort

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.240
that Marx was looking for.
 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.845
So on the big predictions,
Marxism doesn't look very good

00:03:56.845 --> 00:04:02.150
from the vantage point of the
twenty-first century.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.747
But some of his smaller
predictions were also wrong in

00:04:05.747 --> 00:04:09.278
ways that in some respect is
more interesting for our

00:04:09.278 --> 00:04:12.096
purposes,
and so I'm going to go back

00:04:12.096 --> 00:04:16.105
through some of his arguments
and focus on things that were

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:19.079
wrong with those arguments that
we can,

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.416
nonetheless,
draw some interesting

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:25.596
conclusions about as we go on
our way in examining the moral

00:04:25.596 --> 00:04:27.579
foundations of politics.
 

00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:31.593
And I'm going to start with his
macro theory and talk about some

00:04:31.593 --> 00:04:34.586
difficulties with that,
and then I'm going to go

00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:36.879
backwards into the micro theory.
 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.581
So we're doing the reverse,
if you like,

00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:41.730
of what we did on the way in.
 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.139
We started with the micro
theory and we saw how that

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.509
generated the macro theory.
 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.930
Now we're going backwards
through the macro theory,

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.946
and then we will go back into
the labor theory of value and

00:04:51.946 --> 00:04:55.339
the assumptions about
workmanship that underlie it

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:59.839
that he took over from Locke and
secularized and modernized,

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:02.180
as you know.
 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.910
So if you'll recall from
Monday's lecture,

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.367
Marx's macro theory was an
invisible hand theory like

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:13.305
Smith's,
except it was a malevolent

00:05:13.305 --> 00:05:17.910
invisible hand whereas Smith's
was a benign invisible hand.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.404
And one element of it was the
argument about the potential for

00:05:22.404 --> 00:05:25.531
liquidity crises,
that there would be the

00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:28.689
possibility that people would
horde money,

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.480
that money would stop flowing
through the system,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.569
and the system would thereby
become sclerotic.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:41.466
It is the case that capitalist
systems have the potential for

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:45.586
liquidity crises,
but one of the things Marx

00:05:45.586 --> 00:05:51.519
greatly underestimated was the
capacity of capitalist states in

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:57.545
capitalist societies to address
things like liquidity crises and

00:05:57.545 --> 00:06:01.069
other things as well,
we'll see.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.783
It's almost as if he didn't
really take it seriously when he

00:06:04.783 --> 00:06:07.242
and Engels said,
in The Communist

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:10.031
Manifesto,
that the state in capitalist

00:06:10.031 --> 00:06:13.819
society is the executive
committee of the bourgeoisie.

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:17.762
He underestimated what the
state could actually do to

00:06:17.762 --> 00:06:19.430
preserve capitalism.
 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.923
A good example,
in the early years of this

00:06:22.923 --> 00:06:27.952
system was a huge liquidity
crisis in Mexico where the whole

00:06:27.952 --> 00:06:32.980
Mexican economy was on the verge
of complete collapse,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.899
but the western governments,
led by the United States,

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:42.557
put together a fifty billion
dollar package to pump liquidity

00:06:42.557 --> 00:06:46.750
into the Mexican economy until
the crisis was over,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.339
and they succeeded.
 

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:53.642
And so we didn't see the kind
of collapse in the Mexican

00:06:53.642 --> 00:06:57.869
economy that that liquidity
crisis had the potential to

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:58.730
create.
 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:04.031
So the argument about the
potential for liquidity crises

00:07:04.031 --> 00:07:06.918
is valid,
but we have no particular

00:07:06.918 --> 00:07:10.790
reason to think they can't be
managed once the sources of

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.838
liquidity crises are understood,
and governments have the levers

00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:20.459
available to them that were made
available to the Mexican

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:25.329
government during the Clinton
Administration in the U.S.

00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:29.968
Secondly, Marx has this
argument about the declining

00:07:29.968 --> 00:07:32.970
tendency in the rate of profit.
 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.747
As I said to you,
every classical political

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:39.716
economist believed that there
was a declining tendency in the

00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:42.230
rate of profit in market
systems,

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.649
and they thought one of their
jobs was to account for it.

00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:49.365
They thought it was definitely
the case that there is this

00:07:49.365 --> 00:07:52.690
phenomenon, and you had to
explain why it occurs.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.867
In fact, if we look over the
long course of capitalism since

00:07:56.867 --> 00:08:00.454
the nineteenth century,
it's far from clear that there

00:08:00.454 --> 00:08:05.269
is, as an empirical matter,
a long-term declining tendency

00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:07.670
in the rate of profit.
 

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.767
In Marx's case,
as you know,

00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:14.430
his story about the declining
tendency and the rate of profit

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.560
had to do with the increasing
capital intensity of production.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:27.324
That as capitalists compete by
relying more and more on what he

00:08:27.324 --> 00:08:32.570
calls constant capital,
there's less and less fresh

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.875
value created,
and so what capitalist

00:08:35.875 --> 00:08:41.477
entrepreneurs do at the margin
to be more profitable in the

00:08:41.477 --> 00:08:45.440
medium run makes them less
profitable.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.982
So the capitalist who puts the
spinning jenny in increases his

00:08:48.982 --> 00:08:52.072
profits in the short run,
but when there are spinning

00:08:52.072 --> 00:08:55.158
jennies in every cotton factory
in the economy the rate of

00:08:55.158 --> 00:08:58.408
profit is lower than before the
first spinning jenny had been

00:08:58.408 --> 00:08:59.058
put in.
 

00:08:59.058 --> 00:09:03.370
And Marx identified that as the
basic dynamic driving the

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.679
declining tendency in the rate
of profit.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:11.323
Two problems with it;
one is that it assumes there's

00:09:11.323 --> 00:09:15.879
this sort of finite number of
industries.

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:20.870
Because you could grant his
argument and say,

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.090
"Yeah, it's true that the
rate of profit in the cotton

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.032
industry will fall as it becomes
more and more capital

00:09:27.032 --> 00:09:29.586
intensive,"
but there are all kinds of new

00:09:29.586 --> 00:09:33.139
industries that are going to
come into being all the time.

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:37.020
So capital will flow eventually
into other industries and

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.139
they'll start out with big
profit margins,

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:42.860
and then the profit margins
will get competed away,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.090
but then capital will so
somewhere else.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.850
So unless you have this idea
that there's a sort of fixed

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.950
number of lines or production
such that once profits start to

00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:00.048
fall in all of them they're
going to fall economy-wide,

00:10:00.048 --> 00:10:03.346
there's no particular reason,
even working from Marx's own

00:10:03.346 --> 00:10:06.826
premises,
to think that he's come up with

00:10:06.826 --> 00:10:12.041
any lasting account of why the
rate of profit would fall in

00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:14.019
capitalist systems.
 

00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:17.639
Moreover, even putting that
problem to one side,

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:22.754
if you think about it,
even if it is the case that

00:10:22.754 --> 00:10:28.392
making production more
capital-intensive reduces profit

00:10:28.392 --> 00:10:32.404
margins in the long run,
nonetheless,

00:10:32.404 --> 00:10:37.006
if productivity goes up at a
more rapid rate than capital

00:10:37.006 --> 00:10:41.033
displaces labor in the
production process then you

00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:45.470
wouldn't necessarily see the
rate of profit fall.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:50.405
So if the rate of increase in
productivity exceeds the rate at

00:10:50.405 --> 00:10:53.399
which capital is displacing
labor,

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:57.412
or to put it in Marx's jargon,
constant capital is displacing

00:10:57.412 --> 00:11:01.791
variable capital,
then there's actually no reason

00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:05.519
to expect the rate of profit to
fall.

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:09.495
So it all depends on how much
more productive capital makes

00:11:09.495 --> 00:11:12.717
labor, and there's no
theoretical answer to that

00:11:12.717 --> 00:11:13.610
question.
 

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.019
It's an empirical question.
 

00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:19.985
So even though Marx thought
there was a declining tendency

00:11:19.985 --> 00:11:23.952
in the rate of profit it's
debatable whether in fact there

00:11:23.952 --> 00:11:28.615
is,
and it's certainly not the case

00:11:28.615 --> 00:11:34.840
that his theory explained why it
should occur.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.442
His third argument,
competition eliminates

00:11:38.442 --> 00:11:41.442
competitors,
and because production is

00:11:41.442 --> 00:11:44.340
becoming more and more capital
intensive,

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.490
entry costs are going up and
you're not going to see new

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.980
people coming in to the market.
 

00:11:50.980 --> 00:12:00.062
I told the story about NASA and
the O-rings on the Challenger

00:12:00.062 --> 00:12:02.028
blowing up.
 

00:12:02.028 --> 00:12:05.750
There was nobody to come into
the market and take over then,

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:10.730
so you have a monopoly,
a not-very-efficient monopoly

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:15.330
producer who lacks the incentive
to innovate,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.615
and we have the sorts of
problems we saw that developed

00:12:18.615 --> 00:12:20.990
with Morton Thiokol in that
instance.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:26.380
So that's also true only under
a fairly restrictive set of

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.110
assumptions which might not turn
out to be true.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.561
After all, there are some
industries in which there are

00:12:34.561 --> 00:12:36.158
economies of smallness.
 

00:12:36.158 --> 00:12:42.240
Think about Apple Computers
invented in somebody's garage in

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:48.114
California completely upending
IBM and the big established

00:12:48.114 --> 00:12:52.029
capital-intensive computer
firms,

00:12:52.029 --> 00:12:56.250
and totally transforming that
market.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.950
So it's not necessarily true.
 

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:04.160
Marx had in his mind
nineteenth-century industrial

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.583
production,
steel works,

00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:09.620
cotton factories,
this sort of thing,

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.410
but it's a very
historically-bounded perception

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.450
of what it is that goes on in
economic systems.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.514
And there might be all sorts of
sectors in the economy that tend

00:13:21.514 --> 00:13:24.288
to resist the development of
monopolies,

00:13:24.288 --> 00:13:29.260
and in which there are various
economies of smallness that

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.495
actually lend themselves to the
constant entry of new players

00:13:34.495 --> 00:13:37.808
that keep revitalizing the
system.

00:13:37.808 --> 00:13:44.490
And I think the information
technology revolution that has

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:51.288
accompanied your generation
would be exhibit A in defending

00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:53.750
that proposition.
 

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.030
Under-consumption,
or sometimes it's said

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.558
over-production,
obviously it means the same

00:14:00.558 --> 00:14:01.379
thing.
 

00:14:01.379 --> 00:14:05.604
The way we put it into Marx's
sort of conceptual scheme was

00:14:05.604 --> 00:14:09.537
the argument that the workers
collectively couldn't buy

00:14:09.537 --> 00:14:11.649
everything they produced.
 

00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:13.980
Smith believed that.
 

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.200
Ricardo believed that.
 

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.807
Marx believed that,
and early theories of

00:14:18.807 --> 00:14:24.399
imperialism were partly dreamed
up in order to explain that;

00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:29.167
that you get imperialism partly
as a result of the search for

00:14:29.167 --> 00:14:32.981
new markets to address the
endemic weak demand in

00:14:32.981 --> 00:14:34.808
capitalist systems.
 

00:14:34.808 --> 00:14:38.077
Marx is not the only person who
thought there was endemic weak

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:39.740
demand in capitalist systems.
 

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.461
Indeed, Keynes,
the great English economist of

00:14:43.461 --> 00:14:47.019
the first half of the twentieth
century,

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:52.423
and the theorist whose ideas
informed the policies to end the

00:14:52.423 --> 00:14:57.375
Depression also thought there
was endemic weak demand in

00:14:57.375 --> 00:15:02.958
capitalist systems because of a
diminishing marginal propensity

00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.490
to consume.
 

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.309
Keynes' idea was if you have no
money and I give you a dollar

00:15:08.309 --> 00:15:11.091
you'll spend it,
but if you have a million

00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:14.110
dollars and I give you a dollar
you'll save it.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.552
And so when you get into
recessions the problem is weak

00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:20.638
demand,
and so you get the Keynesian

00:15:20.638 --> 00:15:25.447
answer to recessions or
depressions is to spend money at

00:15:25.447 --> 00:15:28.633
the bottom,
for governments to do that

00:15:28.633 --> 00:15:30.580
largely through borrowing.
 

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.097
And this is,
of course, what first,

00:15:33.097 --> 00:15:36.429
the George W. Bush
Administration in its final

00:15:36.429 --> 00:15:40.207
year, and then the Obama
Administration in its first

00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:42.428
year, have been doing.
 

00:15:42.428 --> 00:15:46.625
A classic Keynesian response to
what's now being called The

00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:50.244
Great Recession to prevent it
from becoming a great

00:15:50.244 --> 00:15:51.330
depression.
 

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.475
Namely, the state borrows
money, tries to spend it in the

00:15:55.475 --> 00:15:59.842
part of the economy that will
stimulate demand and then will

00:15:59.842 --> 00:16:02.360
get the economy going back up.
 

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:07.595
So, again, this is an example
of Marx's chronic

00:16:07.595 --> 00:16:14.537
underestimation of the capacity
of the state to do things that

00:16:14.537 --> 00:16:19.019
will stave off crises,
or manage crises,

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:23.330
or prevent them from becoming
catastrophically bad.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:30.205
And so I think we've seen a
vivid illustration of that in

00:16:30.205 --> 00:16:33.519
the last couple of years.
 

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:35.450
Finally, working class
consciousness;

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.947
as all of these other things
were going on and making the

00:16:39.947 --> 00:16:45.250
system creak at the joints and
become less and less functional,

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:50.178
Marx thought that the workers
would start to become a

00:16:50.178 --> 00:16:51.980
class-for-itself.
 

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.269
The workers would start to see
that they were getting ripped

00:16:56.269 --> 00:17:00.585
off and get angry about it,
become mobilized and militant,

00:17:00.585 --> 00:17:05.000
and reach the point where they
believe that they had nothing to

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.779
lose but their chains.
 

00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:10.950
 
 

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.650
Now there are two problems with
that.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:18.890
One we already mentioned last
Wednesday.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.578
This is that Marx was
half-right in thinking that

00:17:22.578 --> 00:17:26.269
people judge their utility by
what others get.

00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:29.509
They don't just ask the Reagan
question,

00:17:29.509 --> 00:17:32.656
"Am I better off than I
was four years ago,"

00:17:32.656 --> 00:17:35.269
they do pay attention to what
others get,

00:17:35.269 --> 00:17:38.430
but they generally,
and this is the part where he

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.381
was wrong and a hundred years of
industrial sociology has now

00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:46.560
pretty much established this,
they tend to compare themselves

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.440
to similarly-situated people.
 

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.212
So workers in the auto industry
compare themselves to steel

00:17:52.212 --> 00:17:56.915
workers or coal workers,
not to the executives who run

00:17:56.915 --> 00:18:00.980
the firms in which they actually
work,

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.868
and that's true up and down the
occupational scale.

00:18:04.868 --> 00:18:08.648
I think I mentioned a professor
would be much more upset to

00:18:08.648 --> 00:18:12.624
learn that their salary is five
thousand dollars less than the

00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:16.468
professor in the next office
than they will be to learn that

00:18:16.468 --> 00:18:20.248
their salary is five hundred
thousand dollars less than the

00:18:20.248 --> 00:18:23.048
attorney who lives down the
street.

00:18:23.048 --> 00:18:26.198
People compare themselves to
others, but to

00:18:26.198 --> 00:18:30.171
similarly-situated others,
not to people very far from

00:18:30.171 --> 00:18:32.868
them in the socioeconomic order.
 

00:18:32.868 --> 00:18:36.750
And so that kind of militancy
doesn't eventuate.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:40.924
More importantly,
Marx actually conflates the

00:18:40.924 --> 00:18:46.333
relative immiseration of the
proletariat with the absolute

00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:49.750
immiseration of the proletariat.
 

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.442
So if we went back through the
slides and we went back to the

00:18:53.442 --> 00:18:56.150
discussion of the theory of
exploitation,

00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:00.746
remember when we did that
little exercise and we saw that

00:19:00.746 --> 00:19:05.259
you would all actually agree to
be more exploited on his

00:19:05.259 --> 00:19:09.855
definition than less exploited
when you had the choice of

00:19:09.855 --> 00:19:14.615
either going to a ten-hours
working day with new technology

00:19:14.615 --> 00:19:18.720
or an eleven-hours working day
without it.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.838
But that measure was a relative
measure.

00:19:22.838 --> 00:19:27.034
It was what you get as a
proportion of the total surplus

00:19:27.034 --> 00:19:30.390
as compared with what the
capitalist gets.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.242
It wasn't an absolute measure,
and we saw that it's perfectly

00:19:35.242 --> 00:19:38.558
possible for the rate of
exploitation,

00:19:38.558 --> 00:19:42.267
as he defines it,
to go up while the level of

00:19:42.267 --> 00:19:45.890
wages remains constant or even
increases.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:50.060
So wages might be going up as
well as exploitation at the same

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:50.538
time.
 

00:19:50.538 --> 00:19:54.674
Well, but if that's true you're
never going to reach absolute

00:19:54.674 --> 00:19:55.710
immiseration.
 

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.317
You're never going to actually
reach the point where workers

00:19:59.317 --> 00:20:01.578
are literally falling into
poverty.

00:20:01.578 --> 00:20:05.978
And if it's the absolute
immiseration that has to trigger

00:20:05.978 --> 00:20:08.884
the militant action,
the working class

00:20:08.884 --> 00:20:12.338
consciousness,
it's not going to happen.

00:20:12.338 --> 00:20:17.300
And indeed, here again Marx
greatly underestimated what

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:23.088
governments can do to make sure
that the workers don't reach the

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:28.509
point where they have nothing to
lose but their chains.

00:20:28.509 --> 00:20:32.792
In the 1950s,
an English Marxian political

00:20:32.792 --> 00:20:38.770
economist called Ralph Miliband,
whose son now is a British

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.769
cabinet member,
by the way, David Miliband,

00:20:42.769 --> 00:20:48.095
and is the likely next leader
of the Labor Party after they

00:20:48.095 --> 00:20:52.318
lose the elections in May to
David Cameron.

00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:55.967
David Miliband's father,
Ralph, wrote a book called

00:20:55.967 --> 00:20:59.980
The State in Capitalist
Society in the 1950s--

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.990
I think it was 1954 but don't
hold me to it--

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.903
in which he said,
"The welfare state is

00:21:05.903 --> 00:21:08.140
capitalism's best friend."
 

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:12.078
The right always attacks the
welfare state,

00:21:12.078 --> 00:21:15.544
but it's capitalism's best
friend because it buys off

00:21:15.544 --> 00:21:19.202
working class discontent,
and it ensures that workers

00:21:19.202 --> 00:21:21.660
have a stake in the existing
order,

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.933
and that they will never reach
this preverbal situation where

00:21:26.933 --> 00:21:30.890
they have nothing to lose but
their chains.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:36.082
So when you work your way
through this macro theory it's

00:21:36.082 --> 00:21:41.273
riddled with holes and doesn't
add up to the collapse of

00:21:41.273 --> 00:21:45.634
capitalism and not,
therefore, particularly

00:21:45.634 --> 00:21:50.920
surprising that capitalism
didn't collapse in the ways that

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.558
Marx predicted.
 

00:21:52.558 --> 00:21:56.368
But now let's dig in a little
bit more to the micro theory,

00:21:56.368 --> 00:21:59.548
and the micro foundations of
Marx's thinking,

00:21:59.548 --> 00:22:05.492
because I think this is where
we will find some interesting

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:11.538
lessons for our own project in
this course going forward.

00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:16.218
At the heart of the micro
theory is the labor theory of

00:22:16.218 --> 00:22:21.502
value, and we're going to say
something about three aspects of

00:22:21.502 --> 00:22:22.108
it.
 

00:22:22.108 --> 00:22:26.494
We're going to talk about
Marx's assumptions about living

00:22:26.494 --> 00:22:31.105
human labor,
the moral argument behind the

00:22:31.105 --> 00:22:36.534
labor theory of value,
which many people you will find

00:22:36.534 --> 00:22:41.202
in this room find appealing
despite the problems with the

00:22:41.202 --> 00:22:45.882
labor theory of value,
and then some alternative

00:22:45.882 --> 00:22:51.210
formulations of what it is that
he was trying to do.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.038
 
 

00:22:55.038 --> 00:22:59.749
If you think back to when we
were doing the exposition of the

00:22:59.749 --> 00:23:03.910
labor theory of value I said
that Marx defends it,

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.170
living human labor-power as a
source of value,

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:16.826
by saying it's the only thing
that creates fresh surplus

00:23:16.826 --> 00:23:19.028
value, okay?
 

00:23:19.028 --> 00:23:23.111
So one difficulty is,
and John Roemer points this out

00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:26.878
in that piece that I had you
read, it ignores the

00:23:26.878 --> 00:23:29.470
contribution of dead workers.
 

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.088
That living workers,
for instance,

00:23:33.088 --> 00:23:35.828
when we talked about the
introduction of machinery,

00:23:35.828 --> 00:23:40.318
the spinning jenny or whatever,
what about the workers who made

00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:41.838
the spinning jenny?
 

00:23:41.838 --> 00:23:44.279
Aren't they part of this
calculation?

00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:48.252
Aren't they being exploited
either by the capitalist or by

00:23:48.252 --> 00:23:51.598
the living workers who use the
spinning jenny?

00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:55.623
So if you took it seriously
you'd have to say those

00:23:55.623 --> 00:24:00.209
exploitation indexes are way too
simple because they don't

00:24:00.209 --> 00:24:03.828
capture the contribution of dead
workers.

00:24:03.828 --> 00:24:08.576
But then a second thing it
doesn't capture,

00:24:08.576 --> 00:24:15.583
the labor theory value assumes
the capitalist contributes what,

00:24:15.583 --> 00:24:16.940
nothing?
 

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:24.077
But why isn't it the case that
the labor that the capitalist

00:24:24.077 --> 00:24:30.608
performs also goes into the
creation of the surplus?

00:24:30.608 --> 00:24:32.838
And again, I think you've got
to imagine,

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:37.020
get yourself back into this
nineteenth-century mindset where

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.990
intellectual work doesn't seem
particularly important.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:45.108
You're just running these big
factories.

00:24:45.108 --> 00:24:49.232
But, of course,
when we think about what the

00:24:49.232 --> 00:24:55.083
role of entrepreneurial ideas is
in the creation of productive

00:24:55.083 --> 00:24:58.631
systems,
it's absurd to say that the

00:24:58.631 --> 00:25:03.914
work of the capitalist doesn't
contribute anything to the value

00:25:03.914 --> 00:25:05.788
of what's produced.
 

00:25:05.788 --> 00:25:06.990
But then you get into the
problem,

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:11.416
well, how do you discover what
is the result of the work of the

00:25:11.416 --> 00:25:15.630
worker and what is the result of
the work of capitalist,

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.690
and there's no mechanism for
dealing with that.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.960
 
 

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:30.891
And then what about the fact
that the worker in Marx's

00:25:30.891 --> 00:25:37.430
typical model has a spouse at
home feeding him,

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:43.739
making his sandwiches as he
goes to the factory and so on

00:25:43.739 --> 00:25:45.430
and so forth.
 

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.279
What about the spouse at home?
 

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:52.720
Why is it just the worker who's
being exploited?

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.280
And various theorists have said
if you take Marxism seriously on

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.598
its own premises,
it seems that,

00:25:59.598 --> 00:26:01.960
again, just as with the dead
worker,

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.236
the stay-at-home spouse is
either being exploited

00:26:05.236 --> 00:26:09.537
indirectly by the capitalist or
is being exploited by the worker

00:26:09.537 --> 00:26:13.358
who goes to work for whom she is
doing unpaid labor.

00:26:13.358 --> 00:26:20.746
And so we've had a series of
feminist critiques of the labor

00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:23.000
theory of value.
 

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.118
And this gets recognized in
daily life.

00:26:28.118 --> 00:26:34.164
There is a very interesting
1986 divorce case in the State

00:26:34.164 --> 00:26:39.680
of New York in which a couple
had gotten married,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.888
he had gone to medical school,
she had stayed at home and

00:26:42.888 --> 00:26:45.640
darned his socks and made
sandwiches for him,

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.618
and helped him through medical
school.

00:26:48.618 --> 00:26:50.710
Anyway, many years later they
get divorced.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:55.710
And apart from the usual issues
in the divorce,

00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:00.708
the court said that the
stay-at-home wife had a property

00:27:00.708 --> 00:27:05.432
interest in her husband's
medical practice that was a

00:27:05.432 --> 00:27:10.884
byproduct of the work that she
had put into it by darning his

00:27:10.884 --> 00:27:16.337
socks and making his sandwiches,
and he went to class and built

00:27:16.337 --> 00:27:17.420
up his practice.
 

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:21.856
And so they awarded her a forty
percent property interest in the

00:27:21.856 --> 00:27:25.942
practice and required him to
maintain life insurance in her

00:27:25.942 --> 00:27:30.451
name for the rest of his life so
that her property interest could

00:27:30.451 --> 00:27:31.788
be protected.
 

00:27:31.788 --> 00:27:34.568
So what you can see once you
start to do this,

00:27:34.568 --> 00:27:38.065
you know, I've just given three
areas where this runs into

00:27:38.065 --> 00:27:42.430
trouble,
once you take seriously the

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:47.006
idea that labor-power,
the capacity to work,

00:27:47.006 --> 00:27:50.663
is the source of value,
why zero-in in this

00:27:50.663 --> 00:27:57.006
monomaniacal way on what one
worker does in the production

00:27:57.006 --> 00:27:58.230
process?
 

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:02.022
What about all of the others
who contribute to the

00:28:02.022 --> 00:28:06.203
productivity of the process
either directly as with the

00:28:06.203 --> 00:28:08.450
capitalist or indirectly?
 

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:11.296
And of course once you make
this point about the

00:28:11.296 --> 00:28:14.573
stay-at-home spouse,
what about the Sunday school

00:28:14.573 --> 00:28:18.140
teacher that drummed the work
ethic into the worker?

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.833
Didn't that Sunday school
teacher contribute something to

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:24.670
the productivity of the worker
and so on?

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:30.637
So you're going to get this
huge web of indecipherable

00:28:30.637 --> 00:28:36.832
entangled entitlements if you're
trying to trace out who

00:28:36.832 --> 00:28:44.038
contributed what work to the
creation of something of value.

00:28:44.038 --> 00:28:53.775
More fundamentally let's dig
into the assumption that making

00:28:53.775 --> 00:28:57.568
creates entitlements.
 

00:28:57.568 --> 00:29:04.084
After all, for Marx this is
what seems to give the theory

00:29:04.084 --> 00:29:06.759
its ideological edge.
 

00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:10.210
As I said, it's a secular
version of Locke's workmanship.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:13.159
It's the claim that workers
produce something for which

00:29:13.159 --> 00:29:14.578
they're not compensated.
 

00:29:14.578 --> 00:29:17.390
They produce something and the
capitalist takes it,

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.839
right?
 

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:21.430
That's the claim.
 

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:25.708
And when we were doing the
exposition of that I said that

00:29:25.708 --> 00:29:30.291
what differentiates labor-power
from all other commodities is

00:29:30.291 --> 00:29:35.029
that it's necessary for the
production of every commodity.

00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:38.420
It's the common denominator of
all commodities.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:43.673
Remember I gave you the example;
I said if I have a certain

00:29:43.673 --> 00:29:49.950
amount of money and I spend it
on a meal,

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:55.182
I consume the meal and it's
gone, whereas if I spend it

00:29:55.182 --> 00:29:58.769
paying somebody to paint my
house,

00:29:58.769 --> 00:30:02.190
at the end of having consumed
their labor-power I have a more

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.160
valuable house.
 

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:09.461
If I go to sell the house I'm
going to get more from it than I

00:30:09.461 --> 00:30:15.038
would have gotten but for not
having had it painted.

00:30:15.038 --> 00:30:18.587
And so that's the idea that the
consumption of living human

00:30:18.587 --> 00:30:21.646
labor-power leads to the
creation of fresh exchange

00:30:21.646 --> 00:30:24.598
value,
whereas mere consumption of a

00:30:24.598 --> 00:30:25.700
meal doesn't.
 

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:29.680
Terrible argument.
 

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.349
What's wrong with it?
 

00:30:32.349 --> 00:30:43.088
 
 

00:30:43.088 --> 00:30:44.680
Nobody can see what's wrong
with it?

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.740
Come on.
 

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:52.231
It's a terrible argument,
hopelessly bad argument,

00:30:52.231 --> 00:30:53.690
anybody?
 

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:55.299
Yes, ma'am?
 

00:30:55.299 --> 00:30:58.769
 
 

00:30:58.769 --> 00:31:01.788
Student: Could the meal's value
be that it keeps you alive?

00:31:01.788 --> 00:31:03.202
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Say a little more.

00:31:03.202 --> 00:31:03.910
You're dead right.
 

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:08.162
Student: So the meal,
even though you can only use it

00:31:08.162 --> 00:31:13.068
once, it is necessary for the
sustained value of yourself.

00:31:13.068 --> 00:31:15.306
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Okay, and just take that

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:16.618
thought a little further.
 

00:31:16.618 --> 00:31:18.484
Where does it go?
 

00:31:18.484 --> 00:31:20.568
You're dead right.
 

00:31:20.568 --> 00:31:25.818
Student: So the value is
constant, or something?

00:31:25.818 --> 00:31:28.308
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Well, not exactly,

00:31:28.308 --> 00:31:31.919
but the point is it's just
wrong to say when I consume that

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:34.611
food it goes,
because after all I have more

00:31:34.611 --> 00:31:37.970
calories of energy which I could
then use to paint my own house

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:39.000
with, let's say.
 

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.230
Of course I might sit on the
couch and watch the Super Bowl

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.682
and just get fat,
but that's my own decision,

00:31:44.682 --> 00:31:45.240
right?
 

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.298
I can use that energy to paint
the house.

00:31:49.298 --> 00:31:54.522
So a very interesting Cambridge
economist called Piero Sraffa

00:31:54.522 --> 00:31:59.224
wrote a book called The
Production of Commodities by

00:31:59.224 --> 00:32:01.750
Means of Commodities.
 

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:06.211
Even though it's about an
80-page book,

00:32:06.211 --> 00:32:10.440
it took him thirty years to
write.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.961
That's a whole different story
which I don't have time to go

00:32:13.961 --> 00:32:14.380
into.
 

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.308
But this is what he said that's
of interest to us.

00:32:18.308 --> 00:32:24.961
He said, "Imagine an
economy that has three

00:32:24.961 --> 00:32:29.207
commodities, corn,
books, food,

00:32:29.207 --> 00:32:34.019
I'm sorry, corn,
books, labor.

00:32:34.019 --> 00:32:37.529
Corn is food;
corn, books and labor.

00:32:37.529 --> 00:32:41.621
Yes, it's true that it takes
labor to produce corn and to

00:32:41.621 --> 00:32:42.788
produce books.
 

00:32:42.788 --> 00:32:48.231
Yes it's true that it does not
take books to produce corn or

00:32:48.231 --> 00:32:54.044
labor, but it's not true that it
doesn't require corn to produce

00:32:54.044 --> 00:32:55.890
labor and books.
 

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.029
So corn, or food,
or anything that's necessary

00:32:59.029 --> 00:33:02.728
for the production of
labor-power is going to have the

00:33:02.728 --> 00:33:05.450
same property that labor-power
has.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:09.009
It's going to be present
necessarily, directly or

00:33:09.009 --> 00:33:12.048
indirectly, in all lines of
production.

00:33:12.048 --> 00:33:14.880
And so Sraffa said,
based on that idea,

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:19.500
you can do a corn theory of
value for this economy that will

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:23.494
have exactly the same
mathematical properties as the

00:33:23.494 --> 00:33:27.605
labor theory of value,
and then you can have your

00:33:27.605 --> 00:33:31.288
theory of the exploitation of
corn by capital,

00:33:31.288 --> 00:33:35.469
the rate of exploitation of
corn by capital that will be

00:33:35.469 --> 00:33:40.028
exactly analogous to the rate of
the exploitation of labor by

00:33:40.028 --> 00:33:40.940
capital.
 

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:48.390
There's no difference,
mathematically identical.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:52.269
Why is that interesting to us?
 

00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:56.525
It's interesting to us because
it shows you that whatever Marx

00:33:56.525 --> 00:34:00.363
says about exploitation merely
being a technical notion,

00:34:00.363 --> 00:34:01.269
it's not.
 

00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:03.740
It's a moral idea.
 

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:09.244
Colloquially we talk about the
exploitation of natural

00:34:09.244 --> 00:34:15.789
resources, but we don't say that
the corn owns what was produced

00:34:15.789 --> 00:34:17.659
with the corn.
 

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:23.922
We don't say the corn was
exploited in the way the worker

00:34:23.922 --> 00:34:27.389
was exploited,
we just don't.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:31.380
Think about an intermediate
case;

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:39.170
the horse down a mineshaft in a
coalmine hauling trucks of coal

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:46.710
from the face to the elevator
that's going to take it out.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.539
We could do the whole Marxian
story.

00:34:49.539 --> 00:34:56.023
We could say the horse covers
the cost of its feed in the

00:34:56.023 --> 00:35:01.155
first hour of the day,
and it works ten-hour days,

00:35:01.155 --> 00:35:05.958
so the other nine hours it's
producing surplus that accrues

00:35:05.958 --> 00:35:08.940
to somebody other than the
horse.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.809
Is the horse exploited?
 

00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:14.139
Yes?
 

00:35:14.139 --> 00:35:16.840
No?
 

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.820
Nobody thinks the horse isn't
exploited.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:25.855
So a much trickier case,
and the reason it's tricky is

00:35:25.855 --> 00:35:31.364
some people are much more open
to the idea of animal rights

00:35:31.364 --> 00:35:33.550
than others, right?
 

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:38.398
So Locke said animals were the
waste of God put there for our

00:35:38.398 --> 00:35:41.306
use, but we're not that
hard-hearted,

00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:42.518
some of us.
 

00:35:42.518 --> 00:35:47.998
So if you think of the horse as
in some sense a kind of moral

00:35:47.998 --> 00:35:53.295
agent then it's not a happy
thing that it's being exploited

00:35:53.295 --> 00:35:54.940
in this sense.
 

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:59.210
But whether or not we want to
say the exploitation is unjust--

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.789
not just cruel if the horse is
suffering,

00:36:01.789 --> 00:36:11.925
but unjust--depends upon some
prior idea that creatures are

00:36:11.925 --> 00:36:19.090
entitled to the product of their
labor.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:22.030
That's the workmanship idea.
 

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:27.465
And that is why even if you
reject the labor theory of

00:36:27.465 --> 00:36:33.514
value, you're still left with
this nagging idea that there's

00:36:33.514 --> 00:36:36.489
something to workmanship.
 

00:36:36.489 --> 00:36:40.579
Most people are not going to
want to totally get rid of

00:36:40.579 --> 00:36:41.639
workmanship.
 

00:36:41.639 --> 00:36:44.851
If I write a book I think,
"I put all that blood,

00:36:44.851 --> 00:36:47.579
sweat, and tears into that
book, it's mine.

00:36:47.579 --> 00:36:50.809
It's mine, my work."
 

00:36:50.809 --> 00:36:52.885
Somebody takes it,
"You've stolen something

00:36:52.885 --> 00:36:53.768
that I made."
 

00:36:53.768 --> 00:36:59.460
It's a very powerful thing in
people.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.849
 
 

00:37:03.849 --> 00:37:06.210
But not everybody accepts it,
right?

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:10.626
Not everybody accepts this
idea, this very

00:37:10.626 --> 00:37:17.090
individualist-centric conception
that we own what we make.

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:19.920
We have this kind of
exclusive--to go back to the

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.869
language of Locke in The
First Treatise,

00:37:22.869 --> 00:37:27.518
that God made us with the
capacity to be miniature gods,

00:37:27.518 --> 00:37:33.827
to have the same ownership
rights over what we make as he

00:37:33.827 --> 00:37:36.530
has over his creation.
 

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.760
Look at Chief Seattle.
 

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.579
He has a very different view.
 

00:37:42.579 --> 00:37:45.760
 
 

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.186
"This we know:
the earth does not belong to

00:37:50.186 --> 00:37:53.199
man, man belongs to the earth.
 

00:37:53.199 --> 00:37:58.079
All things are connected like
the blood that unites us all.

00:37:58.079 --> 00:38:02.286
Man did not weave the web of
life, he is merely a strand in

00:38:02.286 --> 00:38:02.650
it.
 

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:06.050
Whatever he does to the web,
he does to himself."

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:09.940
Very different view of the
world and our place in it;

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.989
not man-centric.
 

00:38:12.989 --> 00:38:17.085
One of the reasons we start
this course with Locke is this

00:38:17.085 --> 00:38:19.960
is where the individualism comes
from.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.969
It's this workmanship ideal.
 

00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:25.108
Doesn't look individualist at
all in Locke's formulation

00:38:25.108 --> 00:38:28.590
because at the end of the day,
it's a theological argument;

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:33.452
it's an argument about God
having maker's rights over his

00:38:33.452 --> 00:38:34.929
whole creation.
 

00:38:34.929 --> 00:38:40.320
But it's the move of saying we
are miniature gods that can

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:45.429
behave in a god-like fashion,
and then secularizing it,

00:38:45.429 --> 00:38:48.929
which leads to the
individualism.

00:38:48.929 --> 00:38:52.940
Or consider something that
Robert Nozick,

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:58.480
a writer we're going to read
later in the class,

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.639
pretty soon,
actually, starting next week--

00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:04.829
he makes fun of the labor
theory of value.

00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:09.242
He says, Why does mixing one's
labor with something make one

00:39:09.242 --> 00:39:10.590
the owner of it?
 

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:15.679
Perhaps because one owns one's
labor (self-ownership,

00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:18.514
if you like),
and so one comes to own a

00:39:18.514 --> 00:39:22.987
previously unowned thing that
becomes permeated with what one

00:39:22.987 --> 00:39:23.659
owns.
 

00:39:23.659 --> 00:39:26.579
Ownership seeps over into the
rest.

00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:32.248
But why isn't mixing what I own
with what I don't own a way of

00:39:32.248 --> 00:39:38.010
losing what I own rather than a
way of gaining what I don't?

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:42.030
If I own a can of tomato juice
and spill it into the sea,

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:45.539
so that its molecules (made
radioactive,

00:39:45.539 --> 00:39:49.518
so I can check this) mingle
evenly throughout the sea,

00:39:49.518 --> 00:39:56.318
do I thereby come to own the
sea, or have I foolishly

00:39:56.318 --> 00:40:00.110
dissipated my tomato juice?
 

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:06.833
Why is it that we want to say
when I put effort and energy

00:40:06.833 --> 00:40:10.610
into something that it's mine?
 

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:15.199
Very, very perplexing and
tricky thing and we will come

00:40:15.199 --> 00:40:20.469
back to it in considerably more
detail later in the course when

00:40:20.469 --> 00:40:25.532
we read John Rawls,
because interestingly it's not

00:40:25.532 --> 00:40:31.376
until we get to John Rawls that
we find anyone who's really

00:40:31.376 --> 00:40:36.213
willing to radically question
workmanship and the

00:40:36.213 --> 00:40:41.050
self-ownership postulate that
goes with it.

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:47.610
Okay, so Marxism seems
problematic, so what's left?

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:51.429
And I think there are really
two main things left.

00:40:51.429 --> 00:40:54.599
One is a negative argument that
comes out of Marxism,

00:40:54.599 --> 00:40:58.429
rather than any of its positive
claims,

00:40:58.429 --> 00:41:04.001
and that is the fact that his
theory of exploitation fails

00:41:04.001 --> 00:41:09.376
doesn't mean that he lacks a
good critique of markets as

00:41:09.376 --> 00:41:14.460
distributors of either good or
harms in society.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.750
 
 

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:23.179
We could go back to our story
about Trump and the bag lady,

00:41:23.179 --> 00:41:24.250
for example.
 

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:29.389
The Pareto superior result in
that example,

00:41:29.389 --> 00:41:32.655
if you remember,
was for the bag lady to die

00:41:32.655 --> 00:41:36.835
because there was no Pareto
superior exchange that could

00:41:36.835 --> 00:41:39.949
occur between Trump and the bag
lady.

00:41:39.949 --> 00:41:44.280
Markets reflect the
inequalities that come into

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:49.929
them, but they don't give any
account of the justice of those

00:41:49.929 --> 00:41:51.530
inequalities.
 

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:53.530
So there's this problem,
if you like,

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:56.706
of the tyranny of the status
quo, and we saw that in the

00:41:56.706 --> 00:41:59.710
economic realm with the analysis
of that problem,

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:03.353
and in the political realm when
we talked about the corn dealer

00:42:03.353 --> 00:42:04.940
problem with Mill,
right?

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:09.289
That the market systems are
biased towards the status quo,

00:42:09.289 --> 00:42:13.639
but market principles are
purely procedural principles.

00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:17.039
They tell you nothing about how
you got the status quo,

00:42:17.039 --> 00:42:20.438
and so there's a kind of
garbage-in/garbage-out problem

00:42:20.438 --> 00:42:21.949
with market systems.
 

00:42:21.949 --> 00:42:26.061
Nozick, we will see,
makes this point explicit when

00:42:26.061 --> 00:42:30.913
he says any remotely plausible
theory of justice is going to

00:42:30.913 --> 00:42:35.090
have to have three parts,
a theory of justice in

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:36.411
acquisition (i.e.
 

00:42:36.411 --> 00:42:41.000
a theory of staring points),
a theory of justice in transfer

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.389
(i.e.
 

00:42:41.389 --> 00:42:44.655
a theory of exchanges),
and a theory of the

00:42:44.655 --> 00:42:47.454
rectification of past injustice
(i.e.

00:42:47.454 --> 00:42:51.498
a theory for addressing
accumulated injustices of the

00:42:51.498 --> 00:42:52.820
past).
 

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.235
And Nozick will,
for reasons which we will go

00:42:55.235 --> 00:42:58.199
into, thinks he has accounts of
all of those things.

00:42:58.199 --> 00:43:04.976
But it's the negative argument
of Marxism, that markets are not

00:43:04.976 --> 00:43:10.442
justified by reference to the
failure of Marx's own

00:43:10.442 --> 00:43:13.940
alternative theory,
is good.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.916
If you're going to have a
justification for the

00:43:16.916 --> 00:43:21.059
distribution that occurs through
markets it's going to have to be

00:43:21.059 --> 00:43:22.289
something else.
 

00:43:22.289 --> 00:43:24.139
It's going to have to be
provided.

00:43:24.139 --> 00:43:28.619
Maybe it can be provided,
but so far in the utilitarian

00:43:28.619 --> 00:43:33.099
and neoclassical traditions it
hasn't been provided.

00:43:33.099 --> 00:43:38.731
So there's a kind of unfinished
agenda there that's put on the

00:43:38.731 --> 00:43:44.085
table by the Marxian critique of
markets even though Marx's

00:43:44.085 --> 00:43:50.550
answer to that problem,
is unconvincing.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:58.284
And then I think secondly what
Marxism leaves us to address is

00:43:58.284 --> 00:44:03.989
not an argument about the
sources of value.

00:44:03.989 --> 00:44:10.152
The labor theory of value is
just a hopeless analytical mess,

00:44:10.152 --> 00:44:13.030
and can't be resuscitated.
 

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:15.889
There's no way to fix the labor
theory of value.

00:44:15.889 --> 00:44:20.380
But there is an argument about
freedom.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:24.023
Remember where we started;
I said unlike the conventional

00:44:24.023 --> 00:44:27.190
wisdom that Marx is an
egalitarian, no.

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:29.530
He's a theorist of freedom.
 

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:33.253
His utopian ideal is a world in
which the free development of

00:44:33.253 --> 00:44:36.543
each is the condition for the
free development of all,

00:44:36.543 --> 00:44:38.840
where our labor in not
alienated.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:43.559
We saw that the utopian version
of that is unsustainable.

00:44:43.559 --> 00:44:48.175
Nonetheless,
Marx's definition of class,

00:44:48.175 --> 00:44:54.210
when you think about it,
is really an argument about

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:55.630
freedom.
 

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:59.902
When he says you're working
class if you have to sell your

00:44:59.902 --> 00:45:03.275
labor power to somebody else in
order to live,

00:45:03.275 --> 00:45:05.599
it's the compulsion,
right?

00:45:05.599 --> 00:45:08.019
It's the compulsion.
 

00:45:08.019 --> 00:45:10.050
It's not whether you choose to.
 

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:13.992
I like lecturing here having a
captive audience of people who

00:45:13.992 --> 00:45:16.820
have to listen to me ramble on
endlessly.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.936
It makes me feel good,
but that's not what makes me

00:45:19.936 --> 00:45:21.369
working class,
right?

00:45:21.369 --> 00:45:25.382
It's that I have to work for
somebody else in order to

00:45:25.382 --> 00:45:26.139
survive.
 

00:45:26.139 --> 00:45:28.030
It's that element of compulsion.
 

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:30.590
That's your lack of freedom.
 

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:35.630
So as Roemer puts it in the
essay that I put on the

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:41.577
syllabus, it's that there's a
class monopoly of the means of

00:45:41.577 --> 00:45:45.610
production which creates that
power;

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:50.155
that some people have the power
to insist that other people work

00:45:50.155 --> 00:45:50.949
for them.
 

00:45:50.949 --> 00:45:54.724
So it's really not about the
calculus of contributions and

00:45:54.724 --> 00:45:57.385
who puts what,
and whether the rate of

00:45:57.385 --> 00:45:59.989
exploitation's two point
three-three,

00:45:59.989 --> 00:46:01.530
or one point six or anything.
 

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.250
It's not about that.
 

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:06.701
It's really about the
distribution of power in the

00:46:06.701 --> 00:46:08.179
production process.
 

00:46:08.179 --> 00:46:11.971
And if we're going to take
anything from Marx that is of

00:46:11.971 --> 00:46:15.969
enduring value it's going to be
an argument about power.

00:46:15.969 --> 00:46:20.054
It's going to be an argument
which says that a world in which

00:46:20.054 --> 00:46:24.139
we organize things so that one
class effectively has power to

00:46:24.139 --> 00:46:27.000
control a different class's
behavior,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.679
that is an unjust world.
 

00:46:29.679 --> 00:46:34.925
And much of the neo-Marxist
literature that people take

00:46:34.925 --> 00:46:40.461
seriously jettisons the labor
theory of value and explores

00:46:40.461 --> 00:46:46.289
this power-based argument as the
root of what it was Marx was

00:46:46.289 --> 00:46:51.730
trying to get at with the
concept of exploitation.

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.099
See you on Monday.
 

00:46:53.099 --> 00:46:58.000

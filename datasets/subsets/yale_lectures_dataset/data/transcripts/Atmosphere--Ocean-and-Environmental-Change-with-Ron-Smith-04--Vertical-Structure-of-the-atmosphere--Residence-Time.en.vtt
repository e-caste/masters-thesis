00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:02.433
RONALD SMITH: Now you may
remember the

00:00:02.433 --> 00:00:06.067
other day when I
derived how planets

00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:11.033
retain their atmospheres, I made
a list of what planets

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:14.233
and moons we expect to
have atmospheres

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:15.600
and which ones don't.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.633
Right at the bottom of that
list, of the ones that we

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.467
thought would have atmosphere,
it's kind of the

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:24.500
last one was Titan.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.100
As it turns out, we have a
lecture today in the geology

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.300
department on the atmosphere
of Titan.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.967
If any of you are interested
in seeing that,

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.967
that's at 4:00 p.m.

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:39.967
in Kline geology 123,
on the first floor,

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:40.900
next building over.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.367
So stop in there if you want to
learn about the atmosphere

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:47.433
of that particular object.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.433
Questions on any of that?

00:00:55.267 --> 00:00:55.667
OK.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.667
Now let's think about what
happened last time.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:01.800
We went over quite a bit of
material, quantitative

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.600
material, it had to do largely
with the perfect gas law and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.233
the concept of pressure.

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:13.400
Are there any questions on the
perfect gas law or those

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.767
derivations that we
did last time?

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:20.500
I went through them relatively
quickly and I don't think we

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.567
spent quite enough time,
perhaps, to get

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:24.267
your questions answered.

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:28.600
Anything on the perfect
gas law?

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:35.467
Remember we found that when
we're using the p equals rho

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:39.667
RT formula the perfect gas
law that we use mostly in

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:43.867
atmospheric sciences, that
gas constant R is not the

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:48.167
universal gas constant it's a
gas constant for the specific

00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:50.833
gas that you are using.

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:54.267
So that's kind of the one trick
to remember when you're

00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:54.933
using that.

00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:59.300
We went on to do a little
discussion on buoyancy.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.000
If you have a blob of air
that's at a different

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.133
temperature than the adjacent
air, we argued that it's

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:12.100
pressure would equilibrate, but
that would leave it --if

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.300
it has a different temperature
that would leave it with a

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.067
different density.

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:19.300
And if it has a different
density then it's going to be

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.833
buoyant and either tending
to accelerate upwards or

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:23.967
accelerate downwards.

00:02:23.967 --> 00:02:27.600
So that was a nice application
of the perfect gas law to

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.733
understand what begins to get
the air moving in the Earth's

00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:33.800
atmosphere or any atmosphere.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.300
It has to do with differential
heating.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.000
If you can heat air differently
so it has

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.500
different temperatures, then
these density differences

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.433
acting through gravity, through
buoyancy, will begin

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:46.300
to get the are moving.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.933
So simple but very fundamental
concept.

00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:53.267
We'll be coming back to that
over and over again.

00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:56.700
Anything on that?

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.000
OK.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.167
Well then at the end, we talked
about the vertical

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:07.233
structure of density
and pressure.

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:10.433
And I'll just review
that very quickly.

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:17.833
Both density and pressure have
a vertical distribution that

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:22.600
is close to the exponential
function.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.333
So for example, mass density rho
as a function of altitude

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:31.800
is given by the density at sea
level, I guess I'll call that

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.200
SL, times e to the minus
z over H sub s.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.267
And the same thing
for pressure.

00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:43.967
Pressure as a function of
altitude is given by the

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:48.000
pressure at sea level
times e to the minus

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.067
height over H sub s.

00:03:52.067 --> 00:03:53.567
H sub s is the scale height.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.833
I'm going to try to give you
a word definition of it.

00:04:06.833 --> 00:04:32.933
It's the height interval over
which the pressure or density

00:04:32.933 --> 00:04:47.200
decreases by a factor
e to the minus one.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.500
In other words, when this
quantity in the exponent is

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.233
one, that's what we're
talking about.

00:04:53.233 --> 00:04:58.900
When you've gone up one scale
height, z is equal to H sub s,

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.300
and you've decreased the
pressure by that amount.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.733
Now, e, you may recall--

00:05:03.733 --> 00:05:06.467
the mathematical constant e--

00:05:06.467 --> 00:05:13.233
is 2.71828, et cetera.

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:16.933
So e to the minus one
is one over that.

00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:22.933
It's about 0.368 and so on,
which we often round off and

00:05:22.933 --> 00:05:24.567
say, well, that's
about one third.

00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:29.667
So here's what we say.

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:38.700
When you go up one scale height,
the pressure has

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.000
dropped to one third of
what it was at the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.467
bottom of that interval.

00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:47.533
So mark off three equal parts.

00:05:47.533 --> 00:05:50.700
Roughly, that's what it's
dropped to when you go up one

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.467
scale height.

00:05:51.467 --> 00:05:54.500
When you go up another scale
height, another--

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.700
let me remind you, scale height
can be computed from RT

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.633
over g, and for Earth, that's
about 8,400 meters.

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:11.700
So when I go up another 8,400
meters and mark off that into

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.733
three parts, it drops by
about another third--

00:06:15.733 --> 00:06:20.067
another 2/3 to a value one third
of what it was at the

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:21.233
bottom of that interval.

00:06:21.233 --> 00:06:22.600
And then that just repeats.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.000
You see, that gives you a curve
that approaches zero but

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.267
never reaches it.

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:34.933
And that's the nature
of the atmosphere.

00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:38.100
The density gets less and less,
but it never actually

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.133
reaches zero because of the
nature of this proportional

00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:45.833
decrease for each scale height
that you go up in the

00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:47.567
atmosphere.

00:06:47.567 --> 00:06:50.367
So there is no such thing as a
top of the atmosphere, where

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:53.267
you could find a level where
there's atmosphere below and

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:54.000
none above.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.033
There is no such place.

00:06:57.033 --> 00:06:59.367
Eventually, of course, you're
in outer space, but even in

00:06:59.367 --> 00:07:03.300
outer space, there are a
few molecules up there.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.167
So that would just be this curve
continuing up quite a

00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:08.433
bit further.

00:07:11.233 --> 00:07:12.100
Are there any questions on this

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.533
concept of a scale height?

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:18.033
It's the best way we have of
describing how the pressure

00:07:18.033 --> 00:07:19.867
and density change
with height.

00:07:19.867 --> 00:07:22.633
It's a rather smooth curve.

00:07:22.633 --> 00:07:25.467
Sometimes it's not exactly
like this, but generally,

00:07:25.467 --> 00:07:26.833
that's a pretty good

00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:28.633
representation of how it works.

00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:28.967
Yes.

00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:31.167
STUDENT: In the equation
up on the scale

00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:32.400
height, what is the R?

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.067
PROFESSOR: So this
is the gas constant for

00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:37.333
the gas in question.

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:38.700
I'll call it the specific
gas constant.

00:07:44.967 --> 00:07:46.933
This is the temperature
of the atmosphere.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:52.133
We have to use a single value
for that, which is a bit of an

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:53.067
approximation.

00:07:53.067 --> 00:07:56.467
And then this is the surface
gravity for the planet.

00:07:56.467 --> 00:08:00.767
For Earth, you know what
that is, 9.81.

00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:02.733
Now, this will be different
on different planets.

00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:07.667
For example, if I had a
different gas, then the gas

00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:08.767
constant would be different.

00:08:08.767 --> 00:08:10.500
If I had a different
temperature,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.400
the T would be different.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.000
And all the other planets, of
course, will have their own

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.933
values for surface gravity.

00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:19.233
So as you go from planet to
planet, you'll find this value

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:20.133
will change.

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:22.633
For some atmospheres,
it'll be larger.

00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:24.367
For some atmospheres,
it'll be smaller.

00:08:24.367 --> 00:08:28.733
A larger value of scale height
means that the atmosphere

00:08:28.733 --> 00:08:31.667
decreases its density more
slowly as you go up.

00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:33.967
You have a deeper atmosphere.

00:08:33.967 --> 00:08:36.733
A smaller value for scale height
means pressure and

00:08:36.733 --> 00:08:39.500
density decrease more rapidly
as you go up.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.133
You have a shallower
or a thinner--

00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:46.667
an atmosphere that's
not as deep.

00:08:46.667 --> 00:08:47.700
Any questions on that?

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.133
Yes.

00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:50.033
STUDENT: For Earth, what
temperature are you using?

00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:52.533
PROFESSOR: So you
can back it out from this, but

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:56.900
I think I used the surface
temperature, 288 Kelvin, which

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.400
probably, as I'll show
in a minute, is

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.667
not the best choice.

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:01.867
It probably would've been better
to use some kind of

00:09:01.867 --> 00:09:04.700
average temperature all up and
down through the atmosphere.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.700
So you're going to get a
slightly different number here

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.000
depending what temperature
you use there.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.733
But for that, remember you're
going to use 8,314 divided by

00:09:15.733 --> 00:09:19.367
the average molecular weight
of air, which is 29.

00:09:19.367 --> 00:09:22.433
That's a mixture of nitrogen,
which is 28, and

00:09:22.433 --> 00:09:24.367
oxygen, which is 32.

00:09:24.367 --> 00:09:28.433
29 is a good molecular weight
for that mixture we call air.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.000
Other questions on this?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.400
So we did an example, and
you can do others.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.767
Just imagine you're on a
mountaintop or you're flying

00:09:40.767 --> 00:09:42.633
in an airplane at a
certain altitude.

00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:46.167
Put that altitude into this
formula, and you can quickly

00:09:46.167 --> 00:09:49.833
compute what the pressure and
density are going to be at

00:09:49.833 --> 00:09:50.533
that level.

00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:52.633
Very convenient, because
that kind of question

00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:53.900
arises all the time.

00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:05.833
Now, while density and pressure
have a pretty

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:10.567
featureless, smooth decrease
with altitude, temperature is

00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:12.000
very different.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.367
So let's talk about the
temperature profile in the

00:10:15.367 --> 00:10:16.633
atmosphere.

00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:23.867
And again, I'll make a plot of
temperature on this axis.

00:10:23.867 --> 00:10:28.833
And altitude, I'll use z
for altitude going up.

00:10:28.833 --> 00:10:31.300
This axis isn't exactly to
scale, but I'll put some

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.267
numbers on it to help you out.

00:10:41.467 --> 00:10:44.033
The temperature of the Earth's
atmosphere is very curious.

00:10:44.033 --> 00:10:46.733
It has a shape like this.

00:10:46.733 --> 00:10:50.867
The average surface temperature
at the surface,

00:10:50.867 --> 00:10:52.767
288 Kelvin.

00:10:52.767 --> 00:10:55.700
Mentioned that.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:03.733
It drops to approximately 200
Kelvin at an altitude of about

00:11:03.733 --> 00:11:08.867
10 kilometers.

00:11:08.867 --> 00:11:15.700
At about 50 kilometers, it comes
back to about what it

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.033
was before--

00:11:18.033 --> 00:11:19.700
not exactly, but about that--

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.667
then it decreases again about
down to 200 at about 90

00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:25.900
kilometers.

00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:33.467
And then it gets quite warm
above that, higher than at the

00:11:33.467 --> 00:11:35.167
surface of the Earth.

00:11:35.167 --> 00:11:38.100
Now, this temperature, though,
changes quite a bit between

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:46.133
day and night as it gets heated
by the Sun and then

00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:46.933
cools at night.

00:11:46.933 --> 00:11:49.067
Well, actually, that
happens at Earth.

00:11:49.067 --> 00:11:50.833
Right down at the surface
of the Earth,

00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:52.267
there's a bit of a diurnal--

00:11:52.267 --> 00:11:54.967
we use the word "diurnal" to
indicate a day-to-night

00:11:54.967 --> 00:11:56.100
fluctuation.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.233
Of course, that happens
right at the surface

00:11:58.233 --> 00:11:58.867
of the Earth, too.

00:11:58.867 --> 00:12:01.833
There's a bit of a diurnal
cycle in temperature.

00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:03.633
And of course, these
temperatures will be changing

00:12:03.633 --> 00:12:06.733
also with weather patterns,
with seasons, and so on.

00:12:06.733 --> 00:12:09.500
So I don't want to indicate
that that's fixed, but

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.567
generally, it looks something
like that.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.867
Now, this is really important.

00:12:15.867 --> 00:12:19.533
And the fact that the atmosphere
is layered in

00:12:19.533 --> 00:12:26.033
temperature gives us the basis
for classifying these

00:12:26.033 --> 00:12:27.800
different altitudes.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.700
And I'm going to give you the
standard classification then.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.300
This layer, from the surface
of the Earth up to about 10

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.100
kilometers, where the
temperature decreases with

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.967
altitude, that's called
the troposphere.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.267
It's defined in just that way.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:50.933
It's the lowest layer starting
at the Earth's surface, and

00:12:50.933 --> 00:12:54.200
the temperature decreases
with altitude.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.567
When the temperature turns
around and starts increasing

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.733
again, that's the
stratosphere.

00:13:04.267 --> 00:13:05.533
Then there's the mesosphere.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.933
And finally, up here, this
is the thermosphere.

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.700
Now, these names do
have some meaning.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.767
They're not just drawn
out of a hat.

00:13:26.767 --> 00:13:31.367
"Tropos" comes from a Greek
word meaning "turning." In

00:13:31.367 --> 00:13:33.967
this case, it implies that that
layer of the atmosphere

00:13:33.967 --> 00:13:36.767
is turning over quite a lot.

00:13:36.767 --> 00:13:38.000
And we'll see why that is.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.967
There's quite a bit of
convection turning that air

00:13:40.967 --> 00:13:43.833
over in the troposphere.

00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:48.833
So "tropos" or "tropo" does
have some meaning.

00:13:48.833 --> 00:13:54.700
"Strato" also, the root comes
from the word "layers." And

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.067
here the air does not
turn over very much.

00:13:57.067 --> 00:14:00.900
It lies there more or less
in quiet layers.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.933
It may be blowing very fast,
but you don't have strong,

00:14:04.933 --> 00:14:08.267
active overturning
or convection.

00:14:08.267 --> 00:14:10.567
Mesosphere, well, it's in
the middle somewhere.

00:14:10.567 --> 00:14:13.600
And then thermosphere is
the hottest layer.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.933
You can use the name to remind
yourself of that.

00:14:17.933 --> 00:14:22.267
We have names also for these
boundaries between the

00:14:22.267 --> 00:14:23.933
different layers.

00:14:23.933 --> 00:14:26.733
The boundary at the top of the
troposphere is the tropopause.

00:14:33.033 --> 00:14:38.600
And then the stratopause, the
mesopause, and there is no top

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.433
to the thermosphere.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.467
Now, this is an interesting
puzzle.

00:14:47.467 --> 00:14:50.067
Why would the Earth's
temperature

00:14:50.067 --> 00:14:51.067
structure look like that?

00:14:51.067 --> 00:14:54.300
Anybody have an idea, a
suggestion of why you might

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.400
have that kind of an odd
temperature structure in the

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.100
Earth's atmosphere?

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.333
STUDENT: In the stratosphere, it
tends to start off cooling

00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:04.500
it more because of the ozone
on top of the stratosphere.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.167
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:07.033
So how does the ozone
do that, though?

00:15:07.033 --> 00:15:08.433
The ozone is playing
a role here.

00:15:08.433 --> 00:15:09.367
What does it do?

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:12.600
STUDENT: It absorbs the
Sun's UV energy.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.733
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's right.

00:15:13.733 --> 00:15:15.267
So if you--

00:15:15.267 --> 00:15:16.200
but that's exactly right.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.633
Now, let me back up.

00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:22.700
If I moved my hand across this
table and I found some hot

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.733
spots and some cool spots, you
would probably guess that

00:15:26.733 --> 00:15:31.367
there's a little heat source
under each of the hot spots.

00:15:31.367 --> 00:15:32.567
And that's exactly right.

00:15:32.567 --> 00:15:36.467
So there's three temperature
maxima here.

00:15:36.467 --> 00:15:42.000
And we have identified three
sources of heat for each of

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.033
the maxima.

00:15:44.033 --> 00:15:47.267
And this one has to
do with ozone

00:15:47.267 --> 00:15:50.133
absorbing ultraviolet light.

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:52.867
So let me lay that out a little
more systematically.

00:15:52.867 --> 00:15:57.167
If you look at the light that
comes from the Sun and I plot

00:15:57.167 --> 00:16:11.533
intensity versus wavelength, it
has kind of a bell-shaped

00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:12.800
curve like this.

00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:18.333
The Sun emits at all
wavelengths--

00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:21.600
very short, intermediate,
very long--

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.867
but most of its radiation
is centered

00:16:23.867 --> 00:16:27.500
somewhere close to about--

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.767
well, I'll put some numbers
on here in just a minute.

00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:30.333
In fact, let me do that.

00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:41.233
So there's a range here from 0.4
to 0.7 microns that's what

00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:44.567
we call the visible part
of the spectrum.

00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:46.600
That's the part of the spectrum
that the human eye is

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.833
sensitive to.

00:16:50.367 --> 00:16:52.600
To the right of that, at longer
wavelengths, we call

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.700
that the infrared part
of the spectrum.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:02.867
And we break that further up
into the near-infrared, NIR,

00:17:02.867 --> 00:17:05.100
and then the middle-
or the long-wave

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.867
infrared further out.

00:17:07.867 --> 00:17:09.267
And the same thing
to the left.

00:17:09.267 --> 00:17:11.933
At shorter wavelengths, we have
the ultraviolet, which

00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:16.600
I'll abbreviate UV. And the
nearest part of that is the

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:22.167
NUV, the near ultraviolet.

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:24.533
And then you have the middle
and the far ultraviolet.

00:17:24.533 --> 00:17:30.867
Way out here, you have x-rays
as part of that spectrum.

00:17:30.867 --> 00:17:35.833
So the Sun is radiating like
this, and those photons, that

00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:39.333
radiation, approaches the Earth
and hits the atmosphere.

00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:40.100
What's going to happen?

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:47.767
Well, it turns out that the
x-rays and the far-ultraviolet

00:17:47.767 --> 00:17:51.733
are absorbed by the first
molecules that they encounter.

00:17:51.733 --> 00:17:53.567
So let me try to
put that here.

00:17:53.567 --> 00:17:56.167
I'll have a double arrow
coming down, and we'll

00:17:56.167 --> 00:18:01.167
indicate that there's absorption
of the x-rays and

00:18:01.167 --> 00:18:07.600
the far UV, FUV.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.800
These other wavelengths--

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.933
the near ultraviolet, the
visible, the near-infrared,

00:18:12.933 --> 00:18:14.300
the far-infrared--

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.367
they are not absorbed
at that level.

00:18:16.367 --> 00:18:19.700
They come streaming
on through.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:24.000
So I'll draw another arrow here
to indicate what happens

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.833
to the near UV, NUV. It gets
absorbed by the ozone that's

00:18:31.833 --> 00:18:34.300
in the stratosphere.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.500
Ozone is a molecule.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.433
You know it's O3.

00:18:37.433 --> 00:18:41.100
It has three oxygen atoms
tied together like that.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.833
And that molecular structure
happens to be able to absorb

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:48.467
near ultraviolet rays.

00:18:48.467 --> 00:18:53.233
So that provides a heat source
which can act here.

00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:55.067
Everything else--

00:18:55.067 --> 00:19:00.367
the visible, the near-infrared,
and much of the

00:19:00.367 --> 00:19:01.733
far-infrared--

00:19:01.733 --> 00:19:05.900
come streaming all the way
down through and gets

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.767
absorbed, finally, by
the ground, by the

00:19:09.767 --> 00:19:12.767
Earth's surface itself.

00:19:12.767 --> 00:19:15.100
The atmosphere doesn't absorb
it at all, but the Earth's

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:15.700
surface does.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.733
And then, the Earth's surface
heats up and passes that heat

00:19:19.733 --> 00:19:23.733
back to the atmosphere by
conduction, and then pretty

00:19:23.733 --> 00:19:29.333
quickly, by convection as well
to heat up the lower part of

00:19:29.333 --> 00:19:30.767
the atmosphere.

00:19:30.767 --> 00:19:33.000
The fact that some of this heat
is transported upwards by

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.267
convection is maybe already
beginning to explain why this

00:19:37.267 --> 00:19:42.333
is the troposphere, why it has
to do with mixing, because

00:19:42.333 --> 00:19:43.667
that heat is being put
into the bottom.

00:19:43.667 --> 00:19:46.833
If you put a pan of water on
the stove and heat it up,

00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:49.167
you're putting the heat
in at the bottom.

00:19:49.167 --> 00:19:52.133
And of course, that pot of water
is going to convect,

00:19:52.133 --> 00:19:55.867
because you are making less
dense water at the bottom.

00:19:55.867 --> 00:19:58.933
And then those buoyancy forces
we were talking about are

00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:00.367
going to make those rise.

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:02.333
And before long, you're
going to have a

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:03.867
convection cell going on.

00:20:07.433 --> 00:20:08.667
Questions on this?

00:20:11.833 --> 00:20:16.267
So, to understand this, we need
to understand the nature

00:20:16.267 --> 00:20:18.233
of the radiation coming
from the sun.

00:20:18.233 --> 00:20:21.533
We'll be coming back to this
when we talk about the Earth's

00:20:21.533 --> 00:20:24.733
energy budget, which we'll
do in just about a week.

00:20:24.733 --> 00:20:28.167
So it won't be long
before we'll be

00:20:28.167 --> 00:20:31.100
revisiting this subject.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.367
Any questions on it?

00:20:39.367 --> 00:20:44.633
Now, you probably have a pretty
good gut feeling for

00:20:44.633 --> 00:20:48.967
distances measured horizontally

00:20:48.967 --> 00:20:49.900
on the Earth's surface.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.667
You know how long a football
field is, 100 yards.

00:20:53.667 --> 00:20:55.400
You know how long a mile is.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.100
But I think most of us, unless
we're pilots or whatever, we

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.733
don't have a good feeling for
distances in the vertical.

00:21:03.733 --> 00:21:09.633
So I want to supplement the
simple diagram by just a few

00:21:09.633 --> 00:21:14.733
facts that you may already know,
but maybe you don't.

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:22.267
For example, Mount Washington,
which is the highest mountain

00:21:22.267 --> 00:21:27.267
in New England, is
1,917 meters.

00:21:27.267 --> 00:21:31.633
That is to say, about
two kilometers.

00:21:31.633 --> 00:21:34.667
So where does that lie
on this diagram?

00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:35.933
It's about there somewhere.

00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:45.533
Mount McKinley, sometimes
called

00:21:45.533 --> 00:21:50.000
Denali, is 6,196 meters.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.200
Let's round that off and
call it six kilometers.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.467
That's the highest mountain
in North America,

00:21:56.467 --> 00:22:00.100
and it's about there.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:08.800
Mount Everest is 8,848 meters.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.500
Let's round that off and call
it nine kilometers, that's

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.400
somewhere about here.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.700
So that gives you some sense
of vertical scale on this

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.267
tropopause business, right?

00:22:20.267 --> 00:22:21.433
Some mountains--

00:22:21.433 --> 00:22:23.067
in fact, this is not always
the same altitude.

00:22:23.067 --> 00:22:24.533
It varies quite a bit.

00:22:24.533 --> 00:22:27.767
Sometimes the tropopause could
be as low as six kilometers on

00:22:27.767 --> 00:22:31.067
occasion, in which case, if
you were standing even on

00:22:31.067 --> 00:22:35.267
Mount McKinley, on such a day,
you would be standing in the

00:22:35.267 --> 00:22:37.500
stratosphere.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.233
On other days, though, on a
typical day, on the top of

00:22:40.233 --> 00:22:42.633
Mount McKinley, you'd be
standing in the upper part of

00:22:42.633 --> 00:22:45.000
the troposphere.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.067
On Mount Everest, it's going
to be a near thing.

00:22:47.067 --> 00:22:48.333
You're going to be
the stratosphere

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:51.333
quite often, actually.

00:22:51.333 --> 00:22:52.400
Now a few other things.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.567
If you fly around a little
bit with aircraft--

00:22:58.767 --> 00:23:00.933
how many have been in
a light plane, like

00:23:00.933 --> 00:23:02.633
a Piper or a Cessna?

00:23:02.633 --> 00:23:04.800
Anybody?

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.633
Remember what it was?

00:23:06.633 --> 00:23:09.133
Remember how high you got?

00:23:09.133 --> 00:23:10.067
13,000 feet.

00:23:10.067 --> 00:23:11.033
That's a good number.

00:23:11.033 --> 00:23:12.833
That's about as high as
you can get in those

00:23:12.833 --> 00:23:14.633
really small airplanes.

00:23:14.633 --> 00:23:19.100
Now that's feet, so I divide
that by three, I get something

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.167
like four kilometers.

00:23:21.167 --> 00:23:22.967
That's about as high as
one of those little

00:23:22.967 --> 00:23:24.900
airplanes can get.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.767
And so that's about here.

00:23:28.767 --> 00:23:31.333
If you've flown recently in
a commuter aircraft--

00:23:36.633 --> 00:23:40.033
just flying from one city to
a close one nearby, you're

00:23:40.033 --> 00:23:45.100
probably going to be at about
20,000 feet, and what that's

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.300
going to be, maybe
seven kilometers.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:56.333
Remember, aviation today, and
always, still uses feet as its

00:23:56.333 --> 00:23:57.167
distance unit.

00:23:57.167 --> 00:23:59.567
They don't use the
metric system.

00:23:59.567 --> 00:24:01.900
So you always have to go back,
when you're talking to a

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.767
pilot, you've got to tell him
how high you want to fly in

00:24:04.767 --> 00:24:07.367
feet, because that's the only
thing he understands.

00:24:07.367 --> 00:24:09.867
But then, for the scientist,
you've got to quickly convert

00:24:09.867 --> 00:24:12.033
that to meters, because we
think in terms of meters.

00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:15.500
So there's a constant conflict
in terms of how we describe

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:19.367
elevation between science
and aviation.

00:24:19.367 --> 00:24:25.200
If you're flying in a regular
airliner, how high are you

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.467
flying there?

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:30.867
You've heard the pilot come
on, ladies and gentlemen,

00:24:30.867 --> 00:24:32.800
thanks for flying
United Airlines.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.733
We've now reached our cruising
altitude of--

00:24:35.733 --> 00:24:39.967
they'll say 35,000 feet, 37,000
feet, 34,000 feet.

00:24:39.967 --> 00:24:45.333
So it varies, but let's
say 35,000 feet.

00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:47.967
And you notice, you'll always
use feet for that.

00:24:47.967 --> 00:24:49.133
And so that's going
to be what?

00:24:49.133 --> 00:24:52.200
That's going be about
11 kilometers.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.733
So that's going to
be about here.

00:24:53.733 --> 00:24:57.500
Most of the time, when you're
flying back and forth across

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.500
this country in a commercial
airliner, you are just at the

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.333
bottom of the stratosphere.

00:25:02.333 --> 00:25:06.500
You're just up in the
stratosphere slightly, but

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.167
then as soon as you begin to
descend down, you're back into

00:25:09.167 --> 00:25:13.267
the troposphere, and you'll be
in the troposphere all the way

00:25:13.267 --> 00:25:15.900
down to the surface.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.367
Questions on that?

00:25:18.367 --> 00:25:22.000
So try to develop a kind of a
sense for these heights--

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.500
and you may want to do it in
different unit systems,

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.533
because you want to connect it
with the way you live your

00:25:28.533 --> 00:25:33.633
daily life, and that's not
always in the metric system.

00:25:40.467 --> 00:25:44.467
I'd like to continue this
discussion a little bit.

00:25:47.633 --> 00:25:49.667
You know the ocean
is layered, too.

00:25:52.367 --> 00:26:00.433
If I draw the surface of the
ocean here, most of the ocean

00:26:00.433 --> 00:26:03.633
has a depth of about
five kilometers.

00:26:06.233 --> 00:26:08.300
This is particularly true in the
part of the ocean that's

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.500
called the Abyssal plane.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.067
We'll be coming back to it later
in the course when we

00:26:13.067 --> 00:26:16.133
talk about the ocean.

00:26:16.133 --> 00:26:18.933
There are large parts of the
ocean that have a rather flat

00:26:18.933 --> 00:26:22.733
bottom, and when it is flat like
that, usually it's about

00:26:22.733 --> 00:26:26.800
five kilometers below
sea level.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.233
And so on this scale,
that would be

00:26:29.233 --> 00:26:31.533
about that depth below.

00:26:31.533 --> 00:26:34.467
So the oceans typically are
about that depth on that kind

00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:36.333
of a scale.

00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:39.767
There is, however, some deeper
parts of the ocean, and they

00:26:39.767 --> 00:26:44.233
are the so-called ocean
trenches, and the deepest one

00:26:44.233 --> 00:26:46.367
is the Marianas Trench.

00:26:46.367 --> 00:26:50.100
M-A-R-I-A-N-A-S trench.

00:26:52.733 --> 00:27:01.633
And that goes down to about 11
kilometers, more than twice

00:27:01.633 --> 00:27:03.367
that typical depth.

00:27:03.367 --> 00:27:06.467
That's the deepest part
of the ocean.

00:27:06.467 --> 00:27:08.100
And that on this scale--

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.500
well it's convenient, isn't it,
because that tropopause is

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.233
about as high as the deepest
part of the ocean is deep.

00:27:16.233 --> 00:27:18.933
It's easy to remember-- easy
to remember that way.

00:27:22.533 --> 00:27:24.200
What else can we use
to put this in

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.433
some kind of a context?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.433
The Earth itself is layered.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.233
If this is Earth.

00:27:37.233 --> 00:27:43.033
Of course, you have the
core, which has an

00:27:43.033 --> 00:27:43.933
inner and outer part.

00:27:43.933 --> 00:27:48.900
You've got the mantle, and then
you've got a thin layer

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:53.133
of rocky material at the surface
that's called the

00:27:53.133 --> 00:27:57.900
crust. And I just want to give
you a couple of numbers for

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.467
that thickness, so you can put
that, too, in the context of

00:28:02.467 --> 00:28:03.833
these other numbers.

00:28:03.833 --> 00:28:07.033
And the two numbers I have
here, the ocean crust--

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.167
when you're over the ocean and
then go down to the bottom and

00:28:13.167 --> 00:28:18.200
find out how deep that rocky
crust layer is, it's typically

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.533
five to ten kilometers.

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:23.500
Continental crust, on
the other hand.

00:28:28.133 --> 00:28:30.967
If you went to the center the
United States and measured how

00:28:30.967 --> 00:28:33.900
deep that rocky crust is
there, it's deeper.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:39.033
It can be 30 to 50
kilometers deep.

00:28:39.033 --> 00:28:42.133
And then beneath that, you get
into the mantle, and of

00:28:42.133 --> 00:28:44.167
course, you go down all the way,
eventually, to the center

00:28:44.167 --> 00:28:48.033
of the Earth, which is-- the
radius of the Earth is 6,370

00:28:48.033 --> 00:28:50.633
kilometers.

00:28:50.633 --> 00:28:52.533
All these numbers-- every number
I've given you-- is

00:28:52.533 --> 00:28:57.333
tiny compared to the full
radius of the Earth.

00:28:57.333 --> 00:29:00.067
But they're comparable to each
other, which is why it's fun

00:29:00.067 --> 00:29:01.800
to get them on the board
at the same time.

00:29:04.933 --> 00:29:06.200
Questions on that?

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.767
All right.

00:29:24.233 --> 00:29:26.367
I want to begin now a
different subject.

00:29:51.767 --> 00:29:55.967
And the broad name for what
I'm about to do is called

00:29:55.967 --> 00:29:57.233
Systems Analysis.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.733
It's used in everything
from chemistry to

00:30:06.733 --> 00:30:09.667
manufacturing to--

00:30:09.667 --> 00:30:13.767
the basic systems analysis
is a study of a somewhat

00:30:13.767 --> 00:30:16.833
complicated system that has
inputs and outputs.

00:30:16.833 --> 00:30:20.100
Normally, you're looking at
a reservoir containing

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.233
something--

00:30:21.233 --> 00:30:23.700
it might be water,
it might be spare

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.633
parts, it might be anything--

00:30:25.633 --> 00:30:28.767
and then you're keeping track
of inputs and outputs and

00:30:28.767 --> 00:30:32.533
trying to understand the
processes involved and how

00:30:32.533 --> 00:30:34.967
those processes control
how much

00:30:34.967 --> 00:30:37.133
you have in the reservoir.

00:30:37.133 --> 00:30:40.467
So the experiment that I'll be
doing on Friday in class

00:30:40.467 --> 00:30:44.300
upstairs is a simple little
experiment where we use a

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.800
water tank.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.200
We put water in at certain rate,
we take water out at a

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.067
certain rate, and we try to
understand the equilibrium

00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:54.567
states of that simple system.

00:30:54.567 --> 00:30:59.633
I'm using it in this course as a
kind of metaphor for all the

00:30:59.633 --> 00:31:02.367
different systems that are
important in atmosphere ocean

00:31:02.367 --> 00:31:07.433
dynamics, including the heat
budget of the Earth, the CO2

00:31:07.433 --> 00:31:11.133
budget of the atmosphere,
and so on and so on.

00:31:11.133 --> 00:31:13.900
Almost everything we think about
in the atmosphere and

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.900
the ocean can be approached
using the simple ideas of

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.500
systems analysis.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.433
The first concept that I want
to introduce in this

00:31:24.433 --> 00:31:27.467
discussion is the concept
of residence time.

00:31:33.633 --> 00:31:37.167
It's defined as the average
time, or the typical time,

00:31:37.167 --> 00:31:39.200
that a particle--

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.267
or whatever the substance is--

00:31:41.267 --> 00:31:42.800
spends in the reservoir.

00:31:45.767 --> 00:31:51.200
So if I have a tank
of something--

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.800
maybe it's water, maybe it has
heat in it, whatever--

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.067
there are inputs.

00:31:59.033 --> 00:32:02.500
There's a certain content.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.733
And there's output.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:15.667
The residence time can be
defined as the content divided

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:18.800
by the flux.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.867
Now if this is in steady
state-- if

00:32:20.867 --> 00:32:22.033
input equals output--

00:32:22.033 --> 00:32:25.267
it doesn't matter which number
we use for the flux.

00:32:25.267 --> 00:32:30.100
It could be the input flux or
the output flux, but it has

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.367
units of time as we'll see.

00:32:32.367 --> 00:32:37.100
And if we know these two things,
the content and the

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.900
flux, we can quickly compute how
long a typical molecule,

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.200
or a typical amount of
heat, or whatever,

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.067
stays in that reservoir.

00:32:48.767 --> 00:32:52.167
So let me do some examples,
because I think that will make

00:32:52.167 --> 00:32:58.133
it clearest, if I just quickly
do some examples of this.

00:32:58.133 --> 00:33:00.267
I'm going to start with
the hydrologic cycle.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.467
So let's imagine that this is
the surface of the Earth.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.667
There is precipitation falling
out of the atmosphere.

00:33:25.667 --> 00:33:31.500
There is evaporation providing
water to the atmosphere, and

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:37.300
our system is the atmosphere
itself, and we'd like to

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.733
understand something about the
residence time of water vapor

00:33:40.733 --> 00:33:44.500
in the Earth's atmosphere.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.567
Well, here's what I know.

00:33:46.567 --> 00:33:50.467
I can take a balloon with an
instrument under it, send that

00:33:50.467 --> 00:33:52.900
up through the atmosphere,
measure the humidity at each

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:58.633
level, and compute the total
amount of water vapor in the

00:33:58.633 --> 00:33:59.167
atmosphere.

00:33:59.167 --> 00:34:01.067
We do that all the time.

00:34:01.067 --> 00:34:03.800
And I'll give you a good round
number, a good average number,

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.833
for how much water vapor
is in the atmosphere.

00:34:06.833 --> 00:34:08.967
But, I'm going to give it to
you in terms of a liquid

00:34:08.967 --> 00:34:10.800
equivalent.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.433
If I condensed out all of that
water vapor into a layer of

00:34:14.433 --> 00:34:17.867
liquid, it would be
approximately

00:34:17.867 --> 00:34:22.267
2.5 centimeters deep.

00:34:22.267 --> 00:34:25.067
So walk outside today, imagine
you've converted all that

00:34:25.067 --> 00:34:27.767
water vapor into a little liquid
layer, it's only going

00:34:27.767 --> 00:34:29.000
to be that deep.

00:34:32.933 --> 00:34:34.400
That would be the content.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.867
That would be one way to
represent how much water vapor

00:34:37.867 --> 00:34:40.133
is in the atmosphere.

00:34:40.133 --> 00:34:44.300
Now you could multiply that
by the surface of the

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.800
Earth--surface area of the Earth
to get a volume, but I'm

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.267
going to leave it just as a
little layer depth as long as

00:34:50.267 --> 00:34:54.367
I'm consistent with the units in
flux, I'm be OK with that.

00:34:54.367 --> 00:34:58.600
So the other thing I need is
the average precipitation.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.367
And that is approximately
1 meter per year.

00:35:06.167 --> 00:35:08.100
So New Haven, Connecticut,
gets about 1.5

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.300
meters per year of rain.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.167
That's quite a lot.

00:35:12.167 --> 00:35:15.433
Certain desert areas
get almost none.

00:35:15.433 --> 00:35:18.067
There are certain mountain top
areas in the tropics where you

00:35:18.067 --> 00:35:24.133
may get seven or eight or nine
meters per year of rainfall.

00:35:24.133 --> 00:35:27.067
But I'm going to give you
this as a typical

00:35:27.067 --> 00:35:29.233
global average value.

00:35:29.233 --> 00:35:33.500
What it says is that every year,
rainfall is equivalent

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:38.200
to about a meter of liquid
water depth.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:43.833
So because these are both
depths, I can use them

00:35:43.833 --> 00:35:48.700
directly to compute the
residence time.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:53.767
So here it comes the residence
time is going to be-- now what

00:35:53.767 --> 00:35:54.767
units shall I use?

00:35:54.767 --> 00:35:56.867
They're incompatible
at the moment.

00:35:56.867 --> 00:35:58.667
So let me keep it
in centimeters.

00:35:58.667 --> 00:36:01.067
2.5 centimeters.

00:36:01.067 --> 00:36:03.267
I'll convert this
to centimeters.

00:36:03.267 --> 00:36:07.733
That will be 100 centimeters
in a meter.

00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:13.167
And so that's going
to be 0.025--

00:36:13.167 --> 00:36:15.767
oh this is centimeters
per year.

00:36:15.767 --> 00:36:17.767
I've got to keep the
time unit in there.

00:36:17.767 --> 00:36:19.633
The centimeters will cancel.

00:36:19.633 --> 00:36:21.433
The year will come up top.

00:36:21.433 --> 00:36:24.867
And the units on my residence
time will be years.

00:36:24.867 --> 00:36:30.800
0.25 years, you can quickly
convert that to nine days.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.067
Typical residence time for water
vapor in the Earth's

00:36:34.067 --> 00:36:36.667
atmosphere is nine days.

00:36:36.667 --> 00:36:39.833
Typically a molecule evaporates
from the surface,

00:36:39.833 --> 00:36:42.467
knocks around up there for about
nine days, then gets

00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:48.267
rained out and spends the time
then back on the Earth's

00:36:48.267 --> 00:36:51.867
surface or in a lake or in the
ocean, something like that.

00:36:51.867 --> 00:36:52.367
Question?

00:36:52.367 --> 00:36:52.867
Yes.

00:36:52.867 --> 00:36:54.033
STUDENT: Is the rate of
precipitation

00:36:54.033 --> 00:36:55.467
and the rate of
evaporation equal?

00:36:55.467 --> 00:36:56.000
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.700
So I'm going to assume that.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.533
We know that that has to be true
over a fairly long period

00:37:01.533 --> 00:37:04.400
of time, because the atmosphere
can't continue to

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.067
increase its water vapor or
decrease its water vapor.

00:37:07.067 --> 00:37:10.800
You reach a steady state fairly
quickly in the Earth

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.033
system where you have that
kind of a balance.

00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:14.500
And I'm assuming that here.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.567
Now let me do the same
argument for

00:37:21.567 --> 00:37:22.833
water in the ocean.

00:37:30.733 --> 00:37:34.767
So label that argument water
in the atmosphere.

00:37:34.767 --> 00:37:36.900
And now this will be
water in the ocean.

00:37:42.233 --> 00:37:45.867
So here's the ocean, five
kilometers deep.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.033
It's the same two processes,
by the way.

00:37:52.033 --> 00:37:55.633
But now the precipitation
is a gain and the

00:37:55.633 --> 00:37:58.400
evaporation is a loss.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.633
So that's backwards from
what we had before.

00:38:00.633 --> 00:38:03.000
But we're talking about a
different reservoir now.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.333
Precipitation adds water vapor,
evaporation removes it.

00:38:09.367 --> 00:38:11.167
This is going to
be really easy.

00:38:11.167 --> 00:38:14.200
Because we were using equivalent
liquid depths over

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.733
here to do the calculation,
we're all set to do this one.

00:38:17.733 --> 00:38:20.167
The flux--

00:38:20.167 --> 00:38:23.567
so the content is going
to be the 5 kilometer

00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:25.067
depth of the ocean.

00:38:25.067 --> 00:38:31.333
So that's going to
be 5,000 meters.

00:38:31.333 --> 00:38:35.767
And the flux is going to be
this precipitation, or

00:38:35.767 --> 00:38:38.800
evaporation, because I'm going
to assume they're in balance.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.833
So the flux is going to
be 1 meter per year.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.733
And even I can do that math.

00:38:49.733 --> 00:38:59.000
That gives me 5,000 years for
the residence time of a water

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.400
molecule in the ocean.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.167
Is that clear?

00:39:06.167 --> 00:39:09.333
So imagine that you're a
water vapor molecule.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:16.600
You've just spent 5,000
years in the ocean.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.000
You work your way up near the
surface, and then one

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.233
wonderful, bright sunny
day you evaporate.

00:39:22.233 --> 00:39:23.500
And suddenly you're free.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:26.600
You're a water vapor molecule
roaming around in the

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.667
atmosphere.

00:39:27.667 --> 00:39:31.833
Nine days later, you're
back in the ocean for

00:39:31.833 --> 00:39:33.933
another 5,000 years.

00:39:33.933 --> 00:39:37.167
That's the way your life goes
if you are a water vapor

00:39:37.167 --> 00:39:39.633
molecule on planet Earth.

00:39:39.633 --> 00:39:42.200
So a big difference.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.400
What's the real root?

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.767
Note the flux is the same.

00:39:44.767 --> 00:39:49.100
It's the reservoir size that
makes a difference in those

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.367
two calculations.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.433
We have time to do a couple
more of these.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.867
Let me do oxygen in
the atmosphere.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:20.600
So the source of oxygen in
the atmosphere will be

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.833
photosynthesis.

00:40:28.767 --> 00:40:37.033
Green plants taking in CO2,
building their structures,

00:40:37.033 --> 00:40:41.167
their biomass, putting off
oxygen into the atmosphere.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.500
You can do this calculation
yourself, and we'll be doing

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.067
it next week.

00:40:48.067 --> 00:40:50.000
But for right now I'm going
to give you the content.

00:40:53.333 --> 00:40:58.467
And it's going to be 10
to the 15th tonnes.

00:40:58.467 --> 00:41:01.667
And I'm going to spell tonnes
in a funny way--

00:41:01.667 --> 00:41:04.767
T-O-N-N-E-S. That's
a metric ton.

00:41:04.767 --> 00:41:08.567
A metric ton, by the way,
is defined as a thousand

00:41:08.567 --> 00:41:15.400
kilograms. A metric ton is
a thousand kilograms.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.900
The flux we can estimate
in a number of ways.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:23.667
For one thing, we could put an
enclosure over a forest or

00:41:23.667 --> 00:41:28.133
over a farmer's field and
measure how fast oxygen is

00:41:28.133 --> 00:41:30.900
being released by the
green plants.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.233
Or-- sorry, I forgot to give
you the other side of it.

00:41:33.233 --> 00:41:39.567
Respiration is how
you lose oxygen.

00:41:39.567 --> 00:41:40.600
And that's happening
right now.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:45.033
Every time I breathe in, I'm
breathing in some oxygen, and

00:41:45.033 --> 00:41:47.067
I'm not breathing
that much out.

00:41:47.067 --> 00:41:50.467
So I'm actually losing oxygen
from the atmosphere

00:41:50.467 --> 00:41:51.500
every time I breathe.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:56.600
Every time a tree rots, you're
taking oxygen out of the

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.933
atmosphere and putting it back
into this degrading biomass.

00:42:01.933 --> 00:42:04.700
And these things are
roughly in balance.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.000
So I can use either
number here.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.367
And the flux is approximately 10
to the 5th tonnes per year.

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:20.167
So the residence time is
very easy to compute.

00:42:20.167 --> 00:42:25.000
It's going to be 10 to the
15th over 10 to the 5th.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.733
That's going to be 10
to the 10th years.

00:42:29.733 --> 00:42:31.367
That is about 10
billion years.

00:42:35.833 --> 00:42:39.800
So residence time for oxygen in
the atmosphere, very long.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.067
This--

00:42:42.067 --> 00:42:46.300
be careful now, these
are rough estimates.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.900
That is almost the
age of the Earth.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:51.067
In fact, that's longer than
the age of the Earth.

00:42:51.067 --> 00:42:54.067
So that's kind of a crazy
answer in a sense.

00:42:54.067 --> 00:42:54.700
So you can't.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.333
You can't have a residence time
longer than the reservoir

00:42:57.333 --> 00:42:58.300
has even been there.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.233
The point though is, these
are rough estimates.

00:43:01.233 --> 00:43:06.133
But oxygen has a very
long residence time.

00:43:06.133 --> 00:43:08.667
Once you get it into the
atmosphere it's going to stay

00:43:08.667 --> 00:43:11.767
there for a very,
very long time.

00:43:11.767 --> 00:43:14.533
But don't take that number
too literally.

00:43:14.533 --> 00:43:17.000
It's done with some
crude estimates.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.933
I want to do at least one more
here which is really important

00:43:24.933 --> 00:43:25.967
for global warming.

00:43:25.967 --> 00:43:28.600
And that is carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.267
Now again, the arrows
are about the same,

00:43:38.267 --> 00:43:39.400
they're just reversed.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:44:00.967
So photosynthesis takes CO2
out, and respiration and

00:44:00.967 --> 00:44:04.833
oxidation you could say as well
puts it back into the

00:44:04.833 --> 00:44:06.967
atmosphere.

00:44:06.967 --> 00:44:09.333
The content of CO2 in
the atmosphere--

00:44:09.333 --> 00:44:11.900
again this is a calculation
we'll be able to do for

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.300
ourselves next week.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.600
But for now, I'll just
give you the answer.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:22.533
It's about 2.3 times 10
to the ninth tonnes.

00:44:22.533 --> 00:44:23.433
And the flux--

00:44:23.433 --> 00:44:26.233
the rate at which it's going
back and forth between the

00:44:26.233 --> 00:44:28.300
surface of the Earth and
the atmosphere--

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:37.433
is about 1.6 times 10 to the
eighth tonnes per year.

00:44:37.433 --> 00:44:47.167
So the resonance time then is
going to be 2,300 times 10 to

00:44:47.167 --> 00:44:54.733
the sixth over 160 times
10 to the sixth tonnes

00:44:54.733 --> 00:44:56.400
and tonnes per year.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.967
So I've just shifted decimal
places to line them up.

00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:04.633
So I can do that to the
10 to the sixth.

00:45:04.633 --> 00:45:09.833
And 2,300 divided
by 160 is 15.

00:45:09.833 --> 00:45:13.700
So by this calculation,
the resonance

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.467
time is about 15 years.

00:45:15.467 --> 00:45:19.000
Now this is also a questionable
number.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.533
Because it turns out that some
of this is reversible.

00:45:23.533 --> 00:45:28.467
In other words, what goes
out during winter

00:45:28.467 --> 00:45:32.433
returns the next summer.

00:45:32.433 --> 00:45:38.300
So what we've derived here is a
low value for the residence

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:42.933
time that is largely driven by
these seasonal, and therefore

00:45:42.933 --> 00:45:44.800
reversible, fluxes.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:51.000
If we summed over a year, the
average flux over a year would

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.267
be quite a bit smaller
than that.

00:45:54.267 --> 00:45:56.900
And notice where that comes
into the calculation.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.133
That'll give you a longer
residence time.

00:45:59.133 --> 00:46:02.067
Maybe as long as 1,000 years.

00:46:02.067 --> 00:46:06.300
So be very careful
with this one.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.967
We've done a calculation
using actual measured

00:46:08.967 --> 00:46:12.667
instantaneous fluxes.

00:46:12.667 --> 00:46:16.233
And it's a valid number
in that context.

00:46:16.233 --> 00:46:19.333
But if you averaged over a year,
where certain processes

00:46:19.333 --> 00:46:22.700
cancel out, you could get
a much larger number for

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:23.433
residence time.

00:46:23.433 --> 00:46:26.600
We're going to come back to this
because it's a key issue

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:31.067
with regard to global warming
and the buildup of CO2--

00:46:31.067 --> 00:46:32.833
anthropogenic CO2--

00:46:32.833 --> 00:46:34.167
in the Earth's atmosphere.

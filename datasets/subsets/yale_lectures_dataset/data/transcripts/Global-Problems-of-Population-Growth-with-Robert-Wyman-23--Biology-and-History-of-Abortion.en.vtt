00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.366
Prof: We'll start a
little slow because I'm sure

00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.170
some people are coming.
 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.727
This--we'll continue with
abortion, we had two lectures

00:00:14.727 --> 00:00:16.770
ago we talked about abortion.
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.945
The center of the abortion
debate is 'when does life

00:00:20.945 --> 00:00:25.612
begin,' and luckily that's a
question that biology can say

00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:27.250
something about.
 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.240
What statement is the most
common statement made on this?

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.048
Not your own personal opinion
and not an educated opinion,

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:40.520
but what do people on the
street say mostly about when

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.870
life begins?
 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.570
What do you hear?
 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.990
Prof: What?
 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.320
Student:  At conception.
 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.407
Prof: At conception and--
all right, yes indeed,

00:00:52.407 --> 00:00:57.200
that's the most common sort of
thing that people say,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.100
life begins at conception.
 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.206
This is in the newspapers,
this is common and this is in

00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:04.108
all the media.
 

00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:06.980
So George Will--how many of you
heard of George Will,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.968
a famous Washington
correspondent.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:14.545
He's syndicated like
everywhere: "It is a

00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:19.040
biological fact,
not a theological postulate,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.780
that such life is a continuum
from conception to death."

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.900
Then just before I was writing
this lecture the first time,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.560
I was scanning The New York
Times, as I always do,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.230
and there was a letter from the
editor--

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.580
letter to the editor from a
pro-life writer.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.134
"It is a scientific fact,
as any basic biology text will

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:42.550
confirm that life does begin at
conception.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.799
The fetus is a live human
being, distinct from,

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.129
while dependent on,
its mother.

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:52.260
It deserves the full protection
of its rights."

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.170
That's what's common out there.
 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.311
Not only is it what people,
most people personally believe,

00:01:58.311 --> 00:02:02.310
but it's generally considered
to be a scientific fact.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.242
I've heard this from prolife
people and prochoice people,

00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:09.620
almost indistinguishably.
 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.238
The question is--you've all had
high school biology at least,

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:15.530
how many of you had college
biology?

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.568
A few of you, guess what?
 

00:02:18.568 --> 00:02:24.658
That isn't what--that isn't at
all what a beginning biology

00:02:24.658 --> 00:02:26.340
textbook says.
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.710
What does it say?
 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.329
This is from--they send
professors free copies of

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.510
textbooks,
so I just opened up one that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.816
they happened to send me,
and it shows something quite

00:02:36.816 --> 00:02:37.660
different.
 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.629
It shows life as a cycle.
 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.970
There's no start point here.
 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.870
Fertilization is one of the
events going around the cycle.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.128
This is the essence of sexual
reproduction.

00:02:53.128 --> 00:02:55.976
We also know that there's
asexual reproduction,

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:58.389
which doesn't have this stuff
at all.

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:03.878
The cycle is the switch between
a haploid genome,

00:03:03.878 --> 00:03:07.430
which means one copy of each
chromosome,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.765
and diploid,
when each cell has two copies

00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:15.500
of each chromosome.
 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.802
With sexual
reproduction--there's always

00:03:19.802 --> 00:03:25.210
some version of this one
copy/two copies cycle.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.831
When we look in detail,
this again from the same

00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:32.532
freshman, very popular,
very big selling freshman

00:03:32.532 --> 00:03:34.460
college biology text.
 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.538
It talks about three different
sexual lifecycles.

00:03:38.538 --> 00:03:41.369
In--the one that you're most
familiar with,

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:42.650
which is animals.
 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.598
What happens is you start with
a--a multi-cellular organism,

00:03:48.598 --> 00:03:49.910
that's you.
 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.389
Then meiosis--the splitting of
the chromosomes so that the

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.906
gametes get--
this is 2N, N being the number

00:03:57.906 --> 00:04:00.286
of chromosomes,
start from 2N,

00:04:00.286 --> 00:04:04.513
there's a process called
meiosis in which pairs split and

00:04:04.513 --> 00:04:08.740
you get cells with only one copy
of each chromosome,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.199
those are called gametes or
germ cells,

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.957
and then from another
individual you get a second N

00:04:14.957 --> 00:04:17.889
and you go back to the diploid
phase.

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.093
It's again, this cycling around
between one copy and two copies

00:04:22.093 --> 00:04:25.350
of the chromosomes,
meiosis and fertilization.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.742
Now in most animals it happens
that the big stage,

00:04:29.742 --> 00:04:33.954
like us, is diploid,
but that is not a universal

00:04:33.954 --> 00:04:35.389
rule at all.
 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.247
Here is a stage which is--are
fungi and some algae that have

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:42.389
it the other way around.
 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.706
They go through the same cycle
but now the big organism is the

00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:50.250
haploid stage,
where there's only one copy of

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.310
each chromosome and that's
growing in your garden,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.829
there will be a lot of stuff
like this.

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:59.250
In most plants,
and some algae,

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.959
you have a third possibility,
whereas, both are

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:05.300
multi-cellular organisms.
 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.793
There's the diploid stage
multi-cellular and the haploid

00:05:10.793 --> 00:05:16.088
stage is multi-cellular,
and the cycle goes around.

00:05:16.088 --> 00:05:20.485
The basic idea is not that
there's a beginning but that

00:05:20.485 --> 00:05:21.949
life is a cycle.
 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.387
This is what--I don't know what
your high school textbook

00:05:24.387 --> 00:05:26.870
says--I was afraid to go look at
high school textbooks.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.490
My colleagues who read high
school textbooks are always

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.312
horrified, so I didn't go lower
than a college--a standard

00:05:34.312 --> 00:05:35.720
college textbook.
 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.733
Again, this is not the only
mechanism of reproduction,

00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:43.672
there's of course a whole
variety of asexual means of

00:05:43.672 --> 00:05:44.959
reproduction.
 

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:51.209
What kinds of things reproduce
asexually with none of this?

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:54.625
Bacteria, yeast,
yeast that makes your bread

00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:59.154
rise, yeast that makes your
beer, yeast that ferments your

00:05:59.154 --> 00:06:02.889
wine, and yeast is fungi between
your toes.

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.470
They reproduce by?
 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.350
What's the mechanism of their
reproduction?

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.910
Budding, they bud off, mitosis.
 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.505
What else, what grows in your
garden that you eat many

00:06:17.505 --> 00:06:18.459
mornings?
 

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:22.430
Strawberries,
how do strawberries reproduce?

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.259
Oh my, you are disconnected
from nature.

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.699
Strawberries--none of you have
strawberries in your garden or

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:31.790
in your backyard?
 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.579
Do you know--who has a garden?
 

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:35.860
Student:  I don't know
how they grow.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.819
Prof: What?
 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:38.300
Student:  I have but I
don't know how they grow.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.709
Prof: She strawberries
don't know--

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:41.350
they have runners,
they have what's called

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.379
rhizomes,
they're called runners and you

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:46.636
have one plant and when it gets
big enough and has enough energy

00:06:46.636 --> 00:06:48.910
it sends out a runner that grows
a root,

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.502
and it grows up a strawberry,
and then it doesn't matter

00:06:51.502 --> 00:06:53.339
whether the runner is eventually
cut.

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:58.646
Lots and lots of things grow by
runners, which is again,

00:06:58.646 --> 00:07:02.410
another asexual form of
reproduction.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.670
Again, since you don't have
yards--so pricker bushes,

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.259
the bane in the northeast,
how do pricker bushes grow?

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:13.980
Runners, that's why your garden
gets just overtaken,

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.519
if you don't get your clippers
out and be very brutal,

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:19.939
your garden just is overtaken
by pricker bush;

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:24.720
bracken is the more technical
term for that.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.329
There's a lot of stuff that
reproduces--grass,

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:31.300
a lot of the grasses grow this
way.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.274
Parthenogenesis,
anybody know who reproduces

00:07:35.274 --> 00:07:37.310
parthenogenetically?
 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.043
Fish do, etc.,
there's fish,

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:45.322
worms;
all kinds of things reproduce

00:07:45.322 --> 00:07:47.620
parthenogenetically.
 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.932
The idea that life begins at
conception, that life has any

00:07:51.932 --> 00:07:56.019
start point is really not what
textbooks are saying.

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:59.329
It's saying life is a cycle,
it's repeated,

00:07:59.329 --> 00:08:01.540
organisms use different
versions of the cycle,

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:08.473
and many organisms reproduce
asexually with no version of

00:08:08.473 --> 00:08:09.338
that.
 

00:08:09.338 --> 00:08:13.028
This gets a little more
interesting when you go from a

00:08:13.028 --> 00:08:16.300
freshman textbook to an upper
level textbook.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.500
A few years ago I got an old
copy of the upper level,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.812
this is Biology
241--Reproductive Biology,

00:08:23.812 --> 00:08:27.529
and I presume none of you have
taken that.

00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:30.879
Now it gets really interesting.
 

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:35.662
This is the beginning of an
embryo in your grandmother,

00:08:35.662 --> 00:08:39.558
or in your grandfather,
it doesn't matter.

00:08:39.558 --> 00:08:47.090
Can you see tiny little dots
here?

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.235
Maybe if we turn out the light
you can see them,

00:08:49.235 --> 00:08:51.609
but it doesn't matter,
believe me there's tiny little

00:08:51.609 --> 00:08:53.389
dots that this line is pointing
to.

00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:56.389
This is inside your
grandmother's womb,

00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:59.649
this is your mother or your
father,

00:08:59.649 --> 00:09:02.751
just remember that's your
mother or father sitting in

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.067
there,
and outside your mother and

00:09:05.067 --> 00:09:06.784
father,
in the yolk sac,

00:09:06.784 --> 00:09:09.600
which you think of as just for
eating,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.517
there's an epithelial wall--an
epithelium is just a set of flat

00:09:13.517 --> 00:09:17.355
cells like a skin that bound--
organs are mostly covered

00:09:17.355 --> 00:09:19.168
around in an epithelium.
 

00:09:19.168 --> 00:09:23.865
Some of the cells in the
epithelium start differentiating

00:09:23.865 --> 00:09:28.894
differently than a skin cell and
they pop out into the center

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:29.649
here.
 

00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:33.296
Then as development goes on,
of your mother inside your

00:09:33.296 --> 00:09:35.889
grandmother,
or your father inside your

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:38.779
grandmother,
not inside your grandfather,

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:41.620
these cells crawl up into the
embryo,

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.822
through a tube,
and they sit in--they come to

00:09:44.822 --> 00:09:49.187
sit up here in the cells that
are going to become the rest of

00:09:49.187 --> 00:09:50.279
your gonad.
 

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:53.730
Your germ cells start--When a
developmental biologist or

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.240
reproductive biologist discusses
this;

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.048
this is in a sense the start of
life.

00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:03.586
In your grand--in your mother
or father's embryo inside your

00:10:03.586 --> 00:10:08.201
grandmother and then more events
happen and the whole book is

00:10:08.201 --> 00:10:09.970
about those events.
 

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.379
What are those events?
 

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:14.423
Many--and so this is on Page 7,
the beginning,

00:10:14.423 --> 00:10:18.412
this is what happens in the
beginning, and when do we get to

00:10:18.412 --> 00:10:19.629
fertilization?
 

00:10:19.629 --> 00:10:21.048
Well here's the next one.
 

00:10:21.048 --> 00:10:25.509
Coitus and fertilization,
and this is on Page 201,

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:30.970
so there's 200 pages of events
that take place in between.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.769
Fertilization is not the first
or the second,

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:36.808
but it's the third kind of
event, even in this one chapter

00:10:36.808 --> 00:10:39.529
and its purpose is the
establishment of diploid,

00:10:39.529 --> 00:10:43.668
again referring to the cycle of
haploid diploid.

00:10:43.668 --> 00:10:46.663
Just to let you know that
fertilization is not an

00:10:46.663 --> 00:10:50.070
essential event,
it includes parthenogenetic

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:55.333
activation as an equivalent step
that can do in the cycle as well

00:10:55.333 --> 00:10:56.980
as fertilization.
 

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.568
The difference between asexual
reproduction and parthenogenesis

00:11:00.568 --> 00:11:03.927
is: asexual reproduction doesn't
go through a halving and a

00:11:03.927 --> 00:11:05.778
doubling of the chromosomes.
 

00:11:05.778 --> 00:11:08.283
In pathogenesis,
you, in fact,

00:11:08.283 --> 00:11:11.674
start with haploid cells,
haploid organism,

00:11:11.674 --> 00:11:14.946
and then there is a mechanism
for just doubling it without

00:11:14.946 --> 00:11:17.299
bringing in genes from somewhere
else.

00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:23.101
What the cell does is mitosis;
it's the normal state where

00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:25.700
cells double but then they
split.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.730
This is a doubling of the
chromosome but no split,

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:36.070
so you go from a haploid stage
to a diploid stage.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.515
While we're on
parthenogenesis--I actually

00:11:40.515 --> 00:11:44.529
didn't know this until I read
this.

00:11:44.529 --> 00:11:47.940
It introduces--The spermatozoon
induces many remarkable changes

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.350
in the oocyte at fertilization,
but it's not essential for many

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.009
of them.
 

00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:55.517
An oocyte may be activated
parthenogenetically by a variety

00:11:55.517 --> 00:11:57.996
of bizarre stimuli such as
electric shock,

00:11:57.996 --> 00:12:00.840
exposure to various enzymes,
or to alcohol.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.626
You guys that think you're
having a big role,

00:12:03.626 --> 00:12:07.428
well just bring your electric
shockers and it'll do almost as

00:12:07.428 --> 00:12:08.000
well.
 

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.490
They mimic whatever it is that
the sperm does and what's

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.490
interesting is that the embryo,
the partheo--this is a human;

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.158
this is a textbook of human
reproductive biology.

00:12:19.158 --> 00:12:21.005
It can undergo cleavage,
implantation,

00:12:21.005 --> 00:12:23.351
and development to the stage of
a beating heart,

00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:24.649
somites and forelimbs.
 

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:28.908
The stage at which a lot of the
right to lifers show you,

00:12:28.908 --> 00:12:33.239
well this is a human already,
actually can happen without any

00:12:33.239 --> 00:12:35.908
intervention of a sperm
whatsoever.

00:12:35.908 --> 00:12:38.960
Eventually, in a human,
there are parthenogenetic

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.427
animals and other organisms,
but in a human,

00:12:42.427 --> 00:12:46.418
the embryo, the fetus
eventually dies,

00:12:46.418 --> 00:12:51.812
but apparently it's a
deficiency in the placenta not

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:54.139
in the fetus itself.
 

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:56.038
It's quite amazing.
 

00:12:56.038 --> 00:12:59.827
Again, loosens up your whole
mind about what is biology is

00:12:59.827 --> 00:13:03.746
actually saying about life and
it's not saying that it has a

00:13:03.746 --> 00:13:07.600
beginning and it's certainly not
saying the beginning is at

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.928
fertilization.
 

00:13:08.928 --> 00:13:12.528
Having started this train of
thought for myself,

00:13:12.528 --> 00:13:15.158
we've done a freshman text,
we've done an upper level text,

00:13:15.158 --> 00:13:18.590
now let's get into the research
literature.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.710
I've just underlined these.
 

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.808
Here's a research literature.
 

00:13:21.808 --> 00:13:24.496
This is Science magazine
which--is one all scientists

00:13:24.496 --> 00:13:26.408
read, it has the latest,
greatest stuff.

00:13:26.408 --> 00:13:28.168
You wish you could publish in
it, and so forth.

00:13:28.168 --> 00:13:33.211
It's from 2007 and it's about
the germline which is eggs and

00:13:33.211 --> 00:13:33.980
sperms.
 

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.336
In the early embryo cells
decide between becoming soma or

00:13:39.336 --> 00:13:40.389
germline.
 

00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:43.649
When I showed you the yolk sac
in your grandmother,

00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:47.043
the soma, the body,
are the cells that stay in the

00:13:47.043 --> 00:13:50.370
yolk sac and form the lining of
the yolk sac,

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:55.200
and produce the enzymes I think
which digest the yolk.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.750
Those that migrate out become
the germline.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.638
Evolution doesn't want the
germline to go through a lot of

00:14:01.638 --> 00:14:04.831
divisions because every division
introduces the possibility of a

00:14:04.831 --> 00:14:05.490
mutation.
 

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.797
Every time you have to copy
your chromosomes you can get

00:14:08.797 --> 00:14:09.700
into trouble.
 

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.216
Very early on,
in fact in your grandmother,

00:14:13.216 --> 00:14:18.322
the germline separates out and
is held in abeyance for decades

00:14:18.322 --> 00:14:19.158
often.
 

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:25.966
Now again, the important thing
is this constancy of the

00:14:25.966 --> 00:14:29.013
germline,
it's necessary for species

00:14:29.013 --> 00:14:31.267
continuity,
that's all that kind of stuff

00:14:31.267 --> 00:14:34.048
and here again,
all kinds of events take place.

00:14:34.048 --> 00:14:37.066
The only mention of
fertilization in this whole

00:14:37.066 --> 00:14:39.690
introduction to this special
section,

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.918
this is a special section just
in this issue,

00:14:41.918 --> 00:14:50.288
is in one of the later
paragraphs.

00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:54.553
Now, I was being very pleased
with myself getting exactly the

00:14:54.553 --> 00:14:58.960
right things that I wanted to
show you and make this point,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.009
that, at all levels of
scientific discourse,

00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:04.058
life does NOT begin at
conception.

00:15:04.058 --> 00:15:09.289
Then I stepped back from it a
little bit and what do I notice?

00:15:09.289 --> 00:15:11.500
What's the logo up there?
 

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.210
The logo is the fertile--an egg
being fertilized.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.913
I said, oh my gosh,
that contradicts everything I'm

00:15:16.913 --> 00:15:19.964
trying to say;
because it's sort of makes out

00:15:19.964 --> 00:15:24.042
that the most important thing
about this whole process is

00:15:24.042 --> 00:15:25.278
fertilization.
 

00:15:25.278 --> 00:15:27.528
After my initial shock,
I get over it;

00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:30.440
I look at it and say,
that's a fake.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.840
Fertilization does not look
like that,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.751
and anybody who's taken a
biology course and seen these

00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:37.532
pictures,
there's first of all a whole

00:15:37.532 --> 00:15:39.768
lot of sperms,
there isn't just one sperm

00:15:39.768 --> 00:15:42.220
sitting like that,
it's a whole lot of them.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.839
That would be a very nice trick
to get a green oocyte and a red

00:15:46.839 --> 00:15:49.745
sperm together,
and I said that's a fake

00:15:49.745 --> 00:15:50.639
picture.
 

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:54.538
You're not supposed to do that
kind of fakery in science,

00:15:54.538 --> 00:15:57.090
but it turns out,
the scientists didn't do that

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.168
but these journals--
this is a mass produced

00:15:59.168 --> 00:16:01.256
thing--Science sells
millions of copies all around

00:16:01.256 --> 00:16:03.360
the world,
so they have an art department.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:12.472
I don't know if you can see
this but that picture is made by

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.788
Getty Images.
 

00:16:14.788 --> 00:16:18.240
Getty is one of the big--Getty
Images Visuals,

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.948
Unlimited;
they're not limited,

00:16:19.948 --> 00:16:20.700
they're unlimited.
 

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.384
This was put in not by the
scientific authors,

00:16:23.384 --> 00:16:26.726
it's not mentioned in the
article, so you're not supposed

00:16:26.726 --> 00:16:28.220
to take it seriously.
 

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.412
And in fact,
when you go after this kind of

00:16:31.412 --> 00:16:35.820
stuff--I just looked about two
pages later--well here it is

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.860
blown up so you can see that
better.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.120
There's the exact picture from
which it's come,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.755
and you can see the flatness
here, and this little thing

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:48.160
here,
and if you go back they show

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.700
you the flatness here and the
little thing here.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.990
They've shown you
exact--inadvertently,

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.639
they don't mention this at all;
they show you exactly where

00:16:57.639 --> 00:16:58.870
they faked it from.
 

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:04.010
What they did is they took this
image, and then took a red sperm

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.356
image from somewhere else,
laid it on top,

00:17:07.356 --> 00:17:09.480
and put them on there.
 

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.440
Yes, I was going to say
something about laying it on but

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.240
I won't, you can guess.
 

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.118
What's the moral of the story
of this last little bit?

00:17:18.118 --> 00:17:20.906
Even prestigious scientific
journals, when they're not

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:23.536
thinking scientifically,
will lapse into the common

00:17:23.536 --> 00:17:25.769
parlance;
this is the society in which

00:17:25.769 --> 00:17:26.380
they live.
 

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.271
The important thing about
reproduction is fertilization,

00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:34.548
that's the common thing;
it's not a scientific thing but

00:17:34.548 --> 00:17:41.858
even scientists and scientific
journals can mess that up.

00:17:41.858 --> 00:17:46.079
The whole phrasing of this
debate in terms of when does

00:17:46.079 --> 00:17:50.455
life begin is a cultural
holdover from the many centuries

00:17:50.455 --> 00:17:55.380
when there was no scientific
understanding of reproduction.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.920
You have to think,
well, when does life begin?

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.500
What is the alternative to it
being a cycle from life coming

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.990
from life that we now know is
the case?

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:08.140
Well it's got to come from
something that's not alive.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.400
Then the question comes up very
naturally, if you think life

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.832
comes from something not alive,
then you say,

00:18:13.832 --> 00:18:15.490
well when does life begin?
 

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:20.307
What is that called when you
believe that life comes from not

00:18:20.307 --> 00:18:20.868
life?
 

00:18:20.868 --> 00:18:25.039
Come on you had this in high
school.

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:26.425
This is a dead--
Student:  Spontaneous

00:18:26.425 --> 00:18:26.700
generation.
 

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.170
Prof: Spontaneous
generation, right.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:34.020
When did they--do you remember
when this was shown to be not

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:34.740
the case?
 

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.880
Student:  Pasteur.
 

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.868
Prof: Pasteur was the
final step in it.

00:18:39.868 --> 00:18:42.467
It actually comes earlier,
the first guy was Francesco

00:18:42.467 --> 00:18:44.064
Redi--
well first let me tell

00:18:44.064 --> 00:18:46.420
you--what are the observations
that make--

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:50.432
that made people think that
there was spontaneous

00:18:50.432 --> 00:18:51.519
generation?
 

00:18:51.519 --> 00:18:54.220
Take a caterpillar and a moth.
 

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.348
You have a caterpillar and its
one kind of organism,

00:18:56.348 --> 00:18:59.452
it crawls around,
it puts itself up into a

00:18:59.452 --> 00:19:00.903
cocoon,
and if at any time,

00:19:00.903 --> 00:19:03.240
not the very beginning and not
the very end but in the middle,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.868
you open up a cocoon what you
see is goo.

00:19:06.868 --> 00:19:11.917
The caterpillar has just sort
of decayed, just fallen apart

00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:13.048
into a goo.
 

00:19:13.048 --> 00:19:16.528
Then you look sometime later
and out pops this beautifully

00:19:16.528 --> 00:19:19.762
formed butterfly and it doesn't
look anything like the

00:19:19.762 --> 00:19:20.740
caterpillar.
 

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.740
The only reasonable way of
interpreting this is that,

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:28.092
indeed, the caterpillar died,
it put itself into a little

00:19:28.092 --> 00:19:29.878
coffin,
and it rotted,

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:33.049
it fell apart,
but that's very nutritious and

00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:36.868
out of this nutrition somehow
came the butterfly,

00:19:36.868 --> 00:19:42.402
spontaneous generation and that
was what was believed about

00:19:42.402 --> 00:19:43.068
that.
 

00:19:43.068 --> 00:19:45.798
You take rotting meat,
where do you find fly's coming

00:19:45.798 --> 00:19:48.160
out of--maggots,
where do you find maggots?

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.785
Rotting meat,
rotting food,

00:19:49.785 --> 00:19:53.221
so you do an experiment,
you go around and you find some

00:19:53.221 --> 00:19:54.910
road kill or something.
 

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:59.665
They didn't really have cars
back then but--this is all late

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:02.808
1600s, 1700s it changes at that
time.

00:20:02.808 --> 00:20:06.098
They take a dead animal and
maggots come out of it.

00:20:06.098 --> 00:20:08.377
Well what it is,
you can take the dead meat that

00:20:08.377 --> 00:20:11.164
you find around,
and put it in a jar and close

00:20:11.164 --> 00:20:13.392
it up,
and, if you haven't actually

00:20:13.392 --> 00:20:16.622
killed it very fresh,
out come the maggots,

00:20:16.622 --> 00:20:20.700
and you haven't let any maggots
crawl into it.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.970
Where do fish come from?
 

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.628
Well, shallow,
most people who fish a lot know

00:20:25.628 --> 00:20:29.057
they come from shallow water
mostly and they grow up in the

00:20:29.057 --> 00:20:31.538
reeds so the fish come from the
reeds.

00:20:31.538 --> 00:20:33.720
Then you get a little
imaginative about it,

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.970
and if you read the literature
from this era,

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.506
which I haven't,
but there's a lot of books that

00:20:39.506 --> 00:20:41.450
do and tell you the juicy
tidbits.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.434
It is believed that it was
possible to create mice by

00:20:44.434 --> 00:20:47.880
putting a dirty shirt and a few
grains of wheat into a sealed

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.118
jar and letting it sit for 21
days.

00:20:50.118 --> 00:20:53.730
That scientifically tells you
the gestation period of a mouse

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.558
is 21 days when it's made from a
dirty shirt.

00:20:56.558 --> 00:21:00.373
I think some of you
undergraduates probably know

00:21:00.373 --> 00:21:02.240
that from experience.
 

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.160
As we'll see in a little bit,
human life was presumed to come

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.296
from menstrual blood,
which is also dead and as a

00:21:09.296 --> 00:21:11.910
sort of coagulation kind of
process.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.150
I'll show you what that was
about.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.618
In everything from an insect to
a human,

00:21:18.618 --> 00:21:23.101
spontaneous generation was the
most obvious interpretation of

00:21:23.101 --> 00:21:27.058
what you could observe for many
hundreds of years,

00:21:27.058 --> 00:21:31.316
until the experimental
techniques really took over and

00:21:31.316 --> 00:21:34.769
people started showing that was
not true.

00:21:34.769 --> 00:21:40.298
The first real break in this
was Francesco Redi in about

00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:46.430
1668, who studied butterflies
and he did it very carefully.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.700
They hadn't really used
scalpels before,

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.526
and so if you pull apart a
cocoon without a really nice

00:21:52.526 --> 00:21:56.130
sharp knife,
you get more mush--you get mush

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.358
at all stages.
 

00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:59.459
He used a scalpel,
cut it apart,

00:21:59.459 --> 00:22:01.828
and you could see that early
on,

00:22:01.828 --> 00:22:06.537
that actually inside the
caterpillar you could see the

00:22:06.537 --> 00:22:10.180
rudiments of the adult moth
happening,

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.085
and then he could watch the
development inside the

00:22:12.085 --> 00:22:12.630
caterpillar.
 

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.805
That was stunning to the world
when he started talking about

00:22:16.805 --> 00:22:20.909
this to scientific societies:
that a moth did not come from

00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:24.660
the rotting caterpillar but came
from the cells--

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.365
they didn't have the idea of
cells back then but came from

00:22:28.365 --> 00:22:30.769
the body of the caterpillar
itself.

00:22:30.769 --> 00:22:33.630
Then Spallanzani,
when I went to high school,

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.630
Spalanzani was the hero--I
don't know why instead of Redi,

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.048
and he did the next step of it,
and that was the next century.

00:22:40.048 --> 00:22:44.786
He worked around the 1750s,
and finally Louis Pasteur

00:22:44.786 --> 00:22:49.338
showed that it was true also for
microorganisms.

00:22:49.338 --> 00:22:52.651
That was what Pasteur put the
final nail in the coffin,

00:22:52.651 --> 00:22:55.227
not only animals,
plants, insects which are

00:22:55.227 --> 00:22:57.680
animals, but finally
microorganisms.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:03.175
By the later 1800s is when this
idea of spontaneous generation

00:23:03.175 --> 00:23:06.328
for everything alive
disappeared.

00:23:06.328 --> 00:23:09.319
The phrase, which
was--originated much earlier but

00:23:09.319 --> 00:23:12.798
not proven, was omnia ex
ova, everything comes from

00:23:12.798 --> 00:23:13.470
an egg.
 

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:20.028
That there's always some sort
of a cycle of generation.

00:23:20.028 --> 00:23:26.268
We've known for about 250 years
that there is no spontaneous

00:23:26.268 --> 00:23:31.597
generation that life is a cycle,
and in the cycle you can't

00:23:31.597 --> 00:23:35.806
point to a beginning,
so it's very hard--it's a sign

00:23:35.806 --> 00:23:41.154
of--there's just the persistence
of cultural ideas that the

00:23:41.154 --> 00:23:45.118
culture somehow hasn't caught
onto that.

00:23:45.118 --> 00:23:48.855
Now more educated people,
when discussing this in more

00:23:48.855 --> 00:23:51.346
detail,
understand that it's a cycle

00:23:51.346 --> 00:23:54.282
but they decide that
fertilization is the final

00:23:54.282 --> 00:23:56.487
genetic--
sets the final genetic

00:23:56.487 --> 00:24:00.277
constitution of the fetus and
therefore we can legitimately

00:24:00.277 --> 00:24:04.190
say--
point to that as the origin

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.069
point.
 

00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:07.660
Of course that's not true.
 

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.598
Now that we know in great
detail.

00:24:10.598 --> 00:24:20.256
I don't want to--this is not a
course in reproductive biology

00:24:20.256 --> 00:24:28.785
but somewhere I've got--
actually at the time of--I'll

00:24:28.785 --> 00:24:32.970
talk about this later.
 

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:42.338
I don't know why this is going
slowly.

00:24:42.338 --> 00:24:53.438
At the time of fertilization
the nucleus of the egg is still

00:24:53.438 --> 00:24:55.318
diploid.
 

00:24:55.318 --> 00:24:59.990
It's only after fertilization
and sometime later,

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.855
that the female nucleus goes
through its final division and

00:25:04.855 --> 00:25:10.058
that's random which chromosomes
are going to be included in the

00:25:10.058 --> 00:25:13.500
embryo and which chromosomes are
not.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.452
The final--part of the
step--one of the steps of the

00:25:16.452 --> 00:25:19.808
final genetic constitution
happens after fertilization,

00:25:19.808 --> 00:25:22.577
if you again define
fertilization as the entry of

00:25:22.577 --> 00:25:23.269
the sperm.
 

00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:26.873
And then even later,
the female has two Xs,

00:25:26.873 --> 00:25:31.420
but in every cell only one X is
going to be active.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.948
Again, at a later stage,
in fact way after this

00:25:34.948 --> 00:25:38.858
multi-cellular division has
already taken place,

00:25:38.858 --> 00:25:43.346
in each cell one of the Xs gets
inactivated and basically

00:25:43.346 --> 00:25:46.150
crumples up and gets thrown
away.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:50.617
The final genetic constitution
is not set until a good bit of

00:25:50.617 --> 00:25:52.630
time after fertilization.
 

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.710
We can see this in Calico cats.
 

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.592
Calico cats have these sorts of
biggish black patches and

00:25:58.592 --> 00:25:59.880
biggish orange patches.
 

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.479
We don't have that with our
hair, our hair is usually all

00:26:04.479 --> 00:26:08.843
one color until it turns gray,
but in Calico cats what you're

00:26:08.843 --> 00:26:11.380
seeing is at a certain point in
development,

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.244
and you can count the number of
patches so you know how many

00:26:14.244 --> 00:26:16.849
cells this comes from,
in one cell there will be two

00:26:16.849 --> 00:26:17.568
sets of genes.
 

00:26:17.568 --> 00:26:21.035
One which will have the melanin
gene to make melanin and make it

00:26:21.035 --> 00:26:23.407
black,
and one will miss that and make

00:26:23.407 --> 00:26:26.925
an orange patch,
and in this cell the gene for

00:26:26.925 --> 00:26:30.440
orange turns off and so you get
a black--

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.358
the chromosome that has the
orange--

00:26:32.358 --> 00:26:35.769
the whole chromosome is turned
off and you get a black patch,

00:26:35.769 --> 00:26:38.700
and in this one,
the one for melanin gets turned

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.818
off and you get an orange patch.
 

00:26:40.818 --> 00:26:45.313
The number of patches tells you
at what cell stage this process

00:26:45.313 --> 00:26:49.806
happened because each of those
patches are the descendants of a

00:26:49.806 --> 00:26:53.140
single cell in a somewhat
advanced embryo.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:27:00.398
The number of genetic things
that happen after fertilization

00:27:00.398 --> 00:27:03.230
is quite significant.
 

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:09.412
Even moderately sophisticated
things that educated people

00:27:09.412 --> 00:27:15.815
believe about development and
when it begins are just plain

00:27:15.815 --> 00:27:16.920
wrong.
 

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:23.082
The only scientific response to
the question of when life begins

00:27:23.082 --> 00:27:25.430
is, when does one say?
 

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:29.824
Well four billion years ago,
when the first cell in some

00:27:29.824 --> 00:27:33.338
slime of some sea somewhere or
something,

00:27:33.338 --> 00:27:37.808
life began and since then cells
have replicated cells.

00:27:37.808 --> 00:27:41.538
In a sense, since every cell in
your body is the result of a

00:27:41.538 --> 00:27:44.910
split of some prior cell,
in a sense every cell in your

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.338
body has been alive for four
billion years.

00:27:47.338 --> 00:27:56.150
There's never been anything
dead in the past of that.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.940
There's really very more
interesting things about

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.099
development if I can get this to
work.

00:28:07.868 --> 00:28:16.407
Development is a very,
very chancy operation there,

00:28:16.407 --> 00:28:21.190
so this is the germ cells.
 

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:24.277
This is in a female but
everything I'm saying about a

00:28:24.277 --> 00:28:25.880
female happens in a male.
 

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:31.778
What happens is from conception
this is the number of germ cells

00:28:31.778 --> 00:28:37.960
that they can count and they get
up to seven million germ cells.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.646
Then, again,
before birth,

00:28:40.646 --> 00:28:42.690
they start dying.
 

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.797
For instance,
in a woman, most of the class

00:28:44.797 --> 00:28:47.678
is female,
you're born with this number of

00:28:47.678 --> 00:28:51.019
potential eggs--
I'm sorry you've developed this

00:28:51.019 --> 00:28:53.805
many eggs,
than most of them die right

00:28:53.805 --> 00:28:57.882
away, and then as gestation
continues more of them die at

00:28:57.882 --> 00:29:01.393
birth,
then they keep dying and by the

00:29:01.393 --> 00:29:06.598
time you're sexually mature
there's only a very few left.

00:29:06.598 --> 00:29:09.130
We used to believe,
and maybe still believe,

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.557
that that's all the eggs you're
ever going to have and a similar

00:29:12.557 --> 00:29:14.569
sort of thing happens with
sperms,

00:29:14.569 --> 00:29:15.980
not quite the same.
 

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:20.736
There's now recent research
that seems to show that there

00:29:20.736 --> 00:29:24.286
are some stem cells,
the kind of cells that

00:29:24.286 --> 00:29:27.190
originally produced all these
oocytes,

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:28.950
that there are some stem cells
that hang around.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.814
Then, in fact,
after this period you can make,

00:29:31.814 --> 00:29:33.660
females can make more eggs.
 

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.788
For the artificial
fertilization,

00:29:35.788 --> 00:29:39.247
artificial reproduction
clinics, this is now a really

00:29:39.247 --> 00:29:40.910
hot area of research.
 

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.380
Can we find those stem cells?
 

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:50.710
For infertile women can we get
them to now make egg cells

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:51.900
later?
 

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:57.990
That's one set of a real
decrease in the potential.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:02.738
You start with seven million
potential eggs but you'll

00:30:02.738 --> 00:30:06.858
ovulate like 400 eggs during a
woman's life.

00:30:06.858 --> 00:30:09.058
This is what ovulation looks
like.

00:30:09.058 --> 00:30:11.806
This is an ovary,
a proper thing,

00:30:11.806 --> 00:30:16.700
and this is the egg that's
coming out and this guy is--

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:21.848
this doctor I guess is trying
to extract the egg for someone,

00:30:21.848 --> 00:30:25.523
either experimental or in
vitro fertilization kind of

00:30:25.523 --> 00:30:28.950
procedure where they can take
the egg and inject it,

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:32.130
fertilize it externally,
inject it back into the female,

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:39.808
and all kinds of wonderful
things can happen.

00:30:39.808 --> 00:30:47.416
Now, after fertilization,
this winnowing of--continues

00:30:47.416 --> 00:30:49.569
very largely.
 

00:30:49.569 --> 00:30:51.259
There's a lot of genetic death.
 

00:30:51.259 --> 00:30:53.664
Now you have your
fertilization,

00:30:53.664 --> 00:30:58.164
the early events of really
setting the genetic constitution

00:30:58.164 --> 00:31:01.890
have taken place,
and often they don't work.

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:05.592
It turns out that from
fertilization,

00:31:05.592 --> 00:31:11.970
in the next few weeks something
like 80% of conceptuses die.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.970
It's a quite striking
phenomenon.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:19.105
It's called pregnancy wastage
and humans have it more than

00:31:19.105 --> 00:31:23.068
other animals and we don't
understand why.

00:31:23.068 --> 00:31:27.378
All mammals have this same
process but it's really extreme

00:31:27.378 --> 00:31:31.612
in humans and there's nothing
but theories about why this

00:31:31.612 --> 00:31:32.519
happens.
 

00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:36.817
It's mostly genetic death,
so I told you that you start

00:31:36.817 --> 00:31:40.112
with a diploid cell,
the germ cell that's crawling

00:31:40.112 --> 00:31:42.787
out of the sac,
and it has two copies of each

00:31:42.787 --> 00:31:43.538
chromosome.
 

00:31:43.538 --> 00:31:46.288
The chromosome unfolded is a
huge thing,

00:31:46.288 --> 00:31:49.740
and it has to fold itself up,
it has to pair,

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.836
they have to all the--26 pairs
have to pair and then they have

00:31:54.836 --> 00:31:56.338
to split nicely.
 

00:31:56.338 --> 00:32:00.201
Well that is a very complicated
process that frequently does not

00:32:00.201 --> 00:32:00.630
work.
 

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.644
What you end up with is,
instead of one copy going each

00:32:04.644 --> 00:32:07.778
way;
you get two copies in this say

00:32:07.778 --> 00:32:12.170
egg, or this sperm and no copy
in the other one.

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:17.288
Then as events go on,
if you have two copies here,

00:32:17.288 --> 00:32:20.523
and it gets fertilized by a
sperm then you have three copies

00:32:20.523 --> 00:32:23.210
and that's lethal for almost
every chromosome,

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:26.275
and if you have no copies and
it gets fertilized by a sperm

00:32:26.275 --> 00:32:28.916
you get one copy and that's
lethal for almost every

00:32:28.916 --> 00:32:29.710
chromosome.
 

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:33.803
The only chromosome for which
there isn't lethality is the

00:32:33.803 --> 00:32:38.038
Down syndrome chromosome where
you can--I think it's 23 .

00:32:38.038 --> 00:32:42.854
You can survive with three
copies of that and that's Down

00:32:42.854 --> 00:32:43.798
syndrome.
 

00:32:43.798 --> 00:32:47.960
You know the frequency of Down
syndrome, one in however many

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.230
thousand it is .
 

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:51.863
For every Triplo,
that's called Triplo because

00:32:51.863 --> 00:32:55.138
you have three copies of that
chromosome, there's a null,

00:32:55.138 --> 00:32:56.308
you get no copy.
 

00:32:56.308 --> 00:32:58.548
You get just the one from the
sperm.

00:32:58.548 --> 00:33:00.964
Where if it's the sperm that
has this problem,

00:33:00.964 --> 00:33:02.630
you get the one from the egg.
 

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.828
That dies and every other
chromosome dies.

00:33:05.828 --> 00:33:08.680
There's one other chromosome
where there's some viability.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.470
You take the frequency of Down
syndrome, you double it for that

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.058
chromosome for the null.
 

00:33:14.058 --> 00:33:17.019
Then you multiply it by the 46
chromosomes--

00:33:17.019 --> 00:33:19.900
23 pairs of chromosomes that
there are and you get a number

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.333
that just from this process,
which is called

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:24.834
non-disjunction,
what the death rate of the

00:33:24.834 --> 00:33:28.608
oocyte--
of the fertilized eggs is.

00:33:28.608 --> 00:33:31.720
Then there's all kinds of other
genetic problems which I won't

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.230
go into.
 

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.653
The experimentally observed,
the empirically observed thing

00:33:35.653 --> 00:33:37.720
is that the actual number is
78%.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:45.263
I say 80% but if you read the
paper its 78% of fertilized

00:33:45.263 --> 00:33:52.269
conceptus' than die very rapidly
of genetic death.

00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:54.624
The mother doesn't even know
that she is pregnant because

00:33:54.624 --> 00:33:56.979
there's--she doesn't know
anything in the first couple of

00:33:56.979 --> 00:33:57.400
weeks.
 

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:02.781
Her period may be a little bit
delayed, maybe not delayed at

00:34:02.781 --> 00:34:03.329
all.
 

00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:10.353
You get really interesting
legal and religious

00:34:10.353 --> 00:34:11.719
complications.
 

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:19.193
Well, there's some theology
here which you can ask me about

00:34:19.193 --> 00:34:21.543
later if you want to know,
but standard Christians are

00:34:21.543 --> 00:34:24.239
supposed to believe that
resurrection is in the flesh.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:30.849
You come back in pretty much
the same state that you died in.

00:34:30.849 --> 00:34:34.340
if 80%--If you believe that
then--if you add to that that

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.938
life begins at conception,
that means at the fertilized

00:34:37.938 --> 00:34:40.940
egg, then that means that 80% of
the embryos--

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.547
of the resurrected bodies in
heaven are going to be in a test

00:34:44.547 --> 00:34:47.730
tube,
they're just a few cells big.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:51.847
So, it gets into very serious
kinds of religious

00:34:51.847 --> 00:34:53.250
complications.
 

00:34:53.250 --> 00:35:00.090
It also gets into legal
complications;

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:02.940
I can't remember what state it
is.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.090
A woman got pulled over,
so this state--

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.380
she was on a highway and in an
HOV lane,

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.855
a high occupancy vehicle lane,
where you're supposed to have

00:35:09.855 --> 00:35:11.239
at least two people in the car.
 

00:35:11.239 --> 00:35:13.978
She was pulled over by the cop
because it was just her,

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:16.159
and the cop started writing her
a ticket.

00:35:16.159 --> 00:35:19.083
She says, 'No,
no I'm pregnant and so there's

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:23.070
two of us in this car,' and it
became a serious kind of court

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:23.670
case.
 

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:28.010
If, legally,
one decides that an embryo or a

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:33.159
fetus is a person from the
moment of conception,

00:35:33.159 --> 00:35:38.409
then every time a woman doesn't
have a baby,

00:35:38.409 --> 00:35:42.255
or she drives,
the police are going to have to

00:35:42.255 --> 00:35:46.360
carry around pregnancy tests and
examine this.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.612
It's--the conclusion,
not the conclusion but--Another

00:35:50.612 --> 00:35:55.766
point about this--Anybody knows
roughly how long it takes to get

00:35:55.766 --> 00:35:58.219
pregnant if you're trying?
 

00:35:58.219 --> 00:35:59.590
Five months.
 

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:03.909
Does that tie up with anything
I just said?

00:36:03.909 --> 00:36:08.760
If 80% of conceptuses die,
that's 4 out of 5.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.246
If it takes five months to get
pregnant, what happens in the

00:36:12.246 --> 00:36:13.429
other four months?
 

00:36:13.429 --> 00:36:16.614
Well those are the four months
that you on average did not get

00:36:16.614 --> 00:36:17.190
pregnant.
 

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:20.284
Though this is not proven,
but the numbers work out that

00:36:20.284 --> 00:36:23.210
there's really no other
reasonable interpretation.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:26.130
When a woman is having regular
sex without protection,

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.768
trying or not trying to get
pregnant,

00:36:28.768 --> 00:36:32.989
she gets pregnant every month,
but four out of the five months

00:36:32.989 --> 00:36:34.943
the fetus--
the conceptus,

00:36:34.943 --> 00:36:38.858
dies early--the fetus dies
early and she doesn't even

00:36:38.858 --> 00:36:41.570
really necessarily know about
it.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:46.039
Then in the fifth month,
on average, out comes a fetus.

00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:50.840
Again, legally and religiously,
that if one--

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:55.952
decides for themselves that
life begins at conception and a

00:36:55.952 --> 00:37:00.724
woman is having sex,
that means every month a human

00:37:00.724 --> 00:37:02.190
being has died.
 

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.909
There has to be a death
certificate.

00:37:04.909 --> 00:37:07.856
There may have to be an
inquest, why did this fetus die,

00:37:07.856 --> 00:37:11.016
did the mother drink alcohol or
do something that might have

00:37:11.016 --> 00:37:12.250
caused that to die?
 

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:18.010
Is she causing the death of
this full human being?

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.005
Religiously you would have to
have a burial,

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:24.320
a memorial mass;
you would have to do all the

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.190
religious things that attend to
death.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:32.706
The fact, that's not widely
appreciated, that 80% of

00:37:32.706 --> 00:37:39.414
conceptus' die genetically sits
uneasily with an idea that life

00:37:39.414 --> 00:37:42.119
begins at conception.
 

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:53.059
We're talking about the
chanciness of the reproduction.

00:37:53.059 --> 00:37:56.460
We saw, that out of all these
eggs that are started,

00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:01.333
so many die before you're born,
and then even those that get

00:38:01.333 --> 00:38:03.853
fertilized,
not many of them get fertilized

00:38:03.853 --> 00:38:06.139
because most people aren't
having sex all the time.

00:38:06.139 --> 00:38:08.786
You don't have 400--So,
there are 400 eggs that you

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:11.434
ovulate and only a small
fraction of those will get

00:38:11.434 --> 00:38:14.239
fertilized no matter what your
sex life is like,

00:38:14.239 --> 00:38:15.699
so there's a big death there.
 

00:38:15.699 --> 00:38:19.090
Of those that do get
fertilized, 80% of them die,

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.590
and then of course as you're
well aware from this course,

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:25.018
once a child is born up until
very modern times of medicine,

00:38:25.018 --> 00:38:29.253
something like a third of the
kids died as infants or

00:38:29.253 --> 00:38:31.855
children,
so it's a very,

00:38:31.855 --> 00:38:38.030
very chancy procedure and
there's elimination at all kinds

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.440
of stages.
 

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.230
Okay so I sort of hit you over
the head with idea of life as a

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:49.099
cycle, and that is of course the
only scientific way to look at

00:38:49.099 --> 00:38:49.650
it.
 

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.480
When does a cycle begin?
 

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.670
Can you even say something like
that?

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:57.050
Well sometimes it's necessary
to arbitrarily put a beginning

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:57.909
to the cycle.
 

00:38:57.909 --> 00:39:00.715
One of the most common cycles
is the seasons,

00:39:00.715 --> 00:39:01.610
is the year.
 

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:04.791
The year is a cycle,
it gets warm and then it gets

00:39:04.791 --> 00:39:08.625
cold, and different cultures
choose different times to start

00:39:08.625 --> 00:39:09.469
the year.
 

00:39:09.469 --> 00:39:12.393
In our culture,
it's January 1,

00:39:12.393 --> 00:39:14.929
and why is it January 1?
 

00:39:14.929 --> 00:39:17.634
It's close to the winter
solstice, the lowest point of

00:39:17.634 --> 00:39:20.134
the sun, then the sun starts
coming up after that,

00:39:20.134 --> 00:39:21.409
which is December 22.
 

00:39:21.409 --> 00:39:24.010
Well the calendars weren't very
good and they didn't it quite

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:25.920
right,
Christmas and New Years,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.612
and December 22--
or 21st are supposed to all be

00:39:28.612 --> 00:39:31.628
the same day,
but the calendars were not good

00:39:31.628 --> 00:39:33.000
enough to do that.
 

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.739
The Romans put it at the Ides
of March, you remember Julius

00:39:35.739 --> 00:39:38.434
Caesar getting killed then,
and I just read the history of

00:39:38.434 --> 00:39:38.860
that.
 

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:42.394
They changed their calendar
many times but during most of

00:39:42.394 --> 00:39:46.119
their period it was the Ides of
March, which is March 15.

00:39:46.119 --> 00:39:48.340
Chinese put their New Year in
February;

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.920
they have lunar calendars so it
rolls around a little bit.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.349
Jewish New Year is in September
and then that's a lunar calendar

00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:56.309
so that rolls around a little
bit.

00:39:56.309 --> 00:40:01.648
Every culture decides how it
wants to set the beginning of

00:40:01.648 --> 00:40:02.679
the year.
 

00:40:02.679 --> 00:40:05.076
It's conventional,
it's not a scientific

00:40:05.076 --> 00:40:08.639
statement, and it's whatever any
of the culture decides.

00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:10.510
Similarly, with when does life
begin?

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:17.233
Different cultures have decided
different start points for this

00:40:17.233 --> 00:40:18.969
cycle of life.
 

00:40:18.969 --> 00:40:23.378
One of the common ones is that
life only begins after the worst

00:40:23.378 --> 00:40:25.440
period of infant mortality.
 

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.170
There are many emotional
economic legal reasons that you

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:31.300
really don't want to consider
someone a human until they've--

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:37.780
you're somewhat sure that the
infant is going to stay alive.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.500
Among the Fulani of West
Africa, Nigeria,

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.454
an infant becomes a person and
it's given a name seven days

00:40:44.454 --> 00:40:48.070
after birth because that's the
most extreme period.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:51.925
The Navajo, in America,
don't consider the child is

00:40:51.925 --> 00:40:54.900
alive,
again for this period of infant

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.150
death,
and after delivery it's kept in

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:00.099
a cradle board as a kind of an
extension of pregnancy.

00:41:00.099 --> 00:41:03.626
It comes out,
it's put in a cradleboard and

00:41:03.626 --> 00:41:08.666
that's considered the mother is
still pregnant with the baby,

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:10.849
and this is very nice.
 

00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:15.121
When the child laughs for the
first time then it's considered

00:41:15.121 --> 00:41:17.900
to be a human being and to be
alive,

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:22.920
and then they have a big
ceremony to mark this child's

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.679
birth.
 

00:41:23.679 --> 00:41:26.188
In some cases,
that you've read about,

00:41:26.188 --> 00:41:28.018
birth happens at puberty.
 

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:31.793
In some of the New Guinea
tribes, the infant stays with

00:41:31.793 --> 00:41:35.273
the women until puberty,
and even boys are considered to

00:41:35.273 --> 00:41:38.175
be women,
they're just female boys and

00:41:38.175 --> 00:41:40.679
girls are not differentiated.
 

00:41:40.679 --> 00:41:45.440
At puberty, the males steal the
boy away and they have a birth

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.300
ceremony.
 

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:52.170
You remember reading about this
in New Guinea.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:55.969
Upon becoming a mother even
because it's so--

00:41:55.969 --> 00:41:59.164
in traditional China,
which means up until the

00:41:59.164 --> 00:42:02.722
Communist revolution,
if not later,

00:42:02.722 --> 00:42:07.139
a woman has sort of two lives.
 

00:42:07.139 --> 00:42:09.264
As you may remember from one of
your readings,

00:42:09.264 --> 00:42:11.579
that often a woman,
a girl child is not even given

00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:13.065
a name;
number one girl,

00:42:13.065 --> 00:42:15.119
number two girl,
number three girl,

00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:18.081
they don't even get a name and
they have sort of a

00:42:18.081 --> 00:42:19.349
quasi-existence.
 

00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:21.719
In this--these parts of Chinese
culture,

00:42:21.719 --> 00:42:24.740
a mother is considered to start
her life all over again at the

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.516
birth of her first son,
not her daughter but the birth

00:42:27.516 --> 00:42:28.409
of her first son.
 

00:42:28.409 --> 00:42:32.880
The mother takes a new name at
this time and she has a--

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.820
she'll, by that time have a
family name,

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.902
but her son is never allowed to
learn what the name of her

00:42:37.902 --> 00:42:40.090
prior--
previous life was.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:44.793
For all intents and purposes
her life begins at the birth of

00:42:44.793 --> 00:42:46.070
her first son.
 

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:47.800
You read the article about the
Egyptian woman;

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.650
do you remember what her name
was?

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.539
Om Gad, and that means?
 

00:42:51.539 --> 00:42:55.460
Mother of Gad,
so again, she takes the name

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:59.943
which--she has a whole life
that's starting anew,

00:42:59.943 --> 00:43:05.360
in a sense, when she has the
first son, mother of Gad.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:10.233
The idea is that different
cultures have very different

00:43:10.233 --> 00:43:12.760
takes on when life begins.
 

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:16.168
Since it's a cycle and it's
arbitrary, cultures have a

00:43:16.168 --> 00:43:19.708
perfect right to choose whatever
point they want for the

00:43:19.708 --> 00:43:21.510
beginning of this cycle.
 

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.277
Even within a culture,
and I'm talking about the

00:43:24.277 --> 00:43:28.367
culture of my friends,
who are largely medical people,

00:43:28.367 --> 00:43:33.099
they all have very strong ideas
about when life begins.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.440
The obstetricians and
gynecologists,

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.735
because the vast majority of
fertilizations do not result in

00:43:43.735 --> 00:43:46.340
a fetus,
and the mother doesn't show any

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.057
signs of it,
the mother doesn't know,

00:43:48.057 --> 00:43:51.237
there's no change in her body,
you can't test anything about

00:43:51.237 --> 00:43:53.873
the body,
they consider implantation,

00:43:53.873 --> 00:43:57.628
where the early embryo sits
into the uterine wall and at

00:43:57.628 --> 00:44:00.768
that point there's hormonal
signals going--

00:44:00.768 --> 00:44:03.909
bouncing back and forth between
the fetus and the maternal one.

00:44:03.909 --> 00:44:09.257
At that point the mother's body
starts changing and so they

00:44:09.257 --> 00:44:12.210
consider that the begin point.
 

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:15.036
When they say 'you're pregnant'
they're not talking about

00:44:15.036 --> 00:44:17.610
fertilization they're talking
about implantation.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.909
This has caused lots of debate.
 

00:44:19.909 --> 00:44:22.809
Depending on where you define
this some--

00:44:22.809 --> 00:44:26.016
like birth control pills and
various devices are supposed to

00:44:26.016 --> 00:44:28.789
work after fertilization but
before implantation.

00:44:28.789 --> 00:44:31.099
If you ask someone who's
talking about beginning of life

00:44:31.099 --> 00:44:32.989
at fertilization,
they say that's abortion.

00:44:32.989 --> 00:44:36.277
If you're talking with
something about the beginning of

00:44:36.277 --> 00:44:39.139
life is at implantation,
that's not abortion.

00:44:39.139 --> 00:44:43.717
This is almost never put out
when people are arguing fiercely

00:44:43.717 --> 00:44:46.922
about these things,
that they're just using

00:44:46.922 --> 00:44:50.510
different definitions of when
things begin.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:54.164
Another very standard one,
very important in Western

00:44:54.164 --> 00:44:56.599
history, is the ability to move.
 

00:44:56.599 --> 00:44:59.250
Back then, starting back from
Aristotle,

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:03.231
the difference between dead and
alive was whether something had

00:45:03.231 --> 00:45:06.570
the power of motion and that was
called animation.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:08.849
When you move you're animated,
like a cartoon,

00:45:08.849 --> 00:45:12.409
a cartoon is a fixed image in a
comic book or something,

00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:16.585
then you have animated
cartoons, and that's where they

00:45:16.585 --> 00:45:17.690
move around.
 

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:20.530
You've probably heard 'The
Quick and the Dead'?

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:23.699
Quick referring to movable as a
famous book, The Quick and

00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:25.547
the Dead,
and it's a very common

00:45:25.547 --> 00:45:26.340
expression.
 

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:32.619
That you're either dead or you
have the power to move.

00:45:32.619 --> 00:45:32.798
St.
 

00:45:32.798 --> 00:45:35.849
Thomas Aquinas tied together,
it actually comes from

00:45:35.849 --> 00:45:38.960
Aristotle and we'll go back to
that in a minute,

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.779
tied, in Catholic theology,
the ability to move with

00:45:42.779 --> 00:45:46.150
animation being alive and that
happens at--

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:52.543
we now call it quickening,
when the mother can feel the

00:45:52.543 --> 00:45:55.150
fetus start to kick.
 

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:59.527
That's another way so you can
have--when the embryo plants,

00:45:59.527 --> 00:46:02.018
when the embryo starts to move.
 

00:46:02.018 --> 00:46:06.659
The neonatologists are very
interested in fetal viability.

00:46:06.659 --> 00:46:09.380
Can the fetus stay alive
outside the mother?

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.380
They argue that this is a sign
that it's an independent being,

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.070
because it can live outside the
mother.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:19.115
That turns out to be,
the most delicate thing is,

00:46:19.115 --> 00:46:21.018
when the lungs can function.
 

00:46:21.018 --> 00:46:24.594
A fetus or a baby can live
outside the mother as long as

00:46:24.594 --> 00:46:29.032
there is enough lung function,
so for the neonatologists,

00:46:29.032 --> 00:46:34.237
life begins when there's enough
lung function so that it can

00:46:34.237 --> 00:46:36.619
live outside the uterus.
 

00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:38.280
Now neurologists,
I'm a neurobiologist,

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.268
so neurologists are closest to
my--I don't know to my heart,

00:46:41.268 --> 00:46:44.364
but they're close to me,
they always define the

00:46:44.364 --> 00:46:47.460
beginning of life as when is
someone human,

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:52.059
as referring to some mental
capacity that they can do.

00:46:52.059 --> 00:46:54.706
It might be motor response,
it might align with the ability

00:46:54.706 --> 00:46:56.916
to move,
that they're looking for motor

00:46:56.916 --> 00:46:59.106
responses,
it might be brainwaves,

00:46:59.106 --> 00:47:01.730
it might be ability to sense
something.

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:05.541
One variant of the
neurologist's point of view has

00:47:05.541 --> 00:47:09.820
gotten, to some extent embedded
in the public debate.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:14.429
This is when the fetus can feel
pain and that's the point at

00:47:14.429 --> 00:47:19.119
which life begins for legal
purposes, as they perceive it.

00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:22.306
There's some research on this
question, not an awful lot,

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:23.730
it's very hard to tell.
 

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:27.960
What you can determine
experimentally is,

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.722
we know there's pain receptors
on the surface like if you

00:47:30.722 --> 00:47:33.289
electric shock something or burn
it or something,

00:47:33.289 --> 00:47:35.190
there's pain receptors,
we can identify those,

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:38.449
we can stimulate those,
and we know the pathways by

00:47:38.449 --> 00:47:40.599
which it goes up to the cortex.
 

00:47:40.599 --> 00:47:43.967
By the seventh month,
at the beginning of the seventh

00:47:43.967 --> 00:47:46.030
month,
those neural pathways are

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:49.467
mature enough so that at least
the information that there's

00:47:49.467 --> 00:47:51.719
some pain has gone into the
cortex.

00:47:51.719 --> 00:47:54.279
We still have no information on
what, if anything,

00:47:54.279 --> 00:47:57.099
the cortex does with that
information at this stage.

00:47:57.099 --> 00:48:02.409
It may not be ready to have any
kind of response to it.

00:48:02.409 --> 00:48:06.367
I go on about all these
different ways of defining the

00:48:06.367 --> 00:48:10.827
beginning of a cycle,
beginning of the cycle of life,

00:48:10.827 --> 00:48:14.699
and it's up to your cultural or
scientific,

00:48:14.699 --> 00:48:16.650
or academic predilections.
 

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:18.289
You can do set whenever you
want.

00:48:18.289 --> 00:48:21.327
All of those designations are
equally legitimate and equally

00:48:21.327 --> 00:48:22.099
illegitimate.
 

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:24.010
None of them are a scientific
question.

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:27.592
Science will describe to you
all the stages of the cycle,

00:48:27.592 --> 00:48:31.110
but it won't say anything about
where you should say the

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.030
beginning of the cycle is.
 

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:36.369
It's a chicken and the egg
problem, just very simply.

00:48:40.119 --> 00:48:44.969
Now you have this thing that is
not a scientific question.

00:48:44.969 --> 00:48:48.150
There's tremendous cultural
diversity about it.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:52.934
There's tremendous diversity
within the public of one culture

00:48:52.934 --> 00:48:54.610
like ours about it.
 

00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:58.632
But, the law has to define
murder because you can't go and

00:48:58.632 --> 00:49:01.949
murder a TA because they gave me
a bad grade.

00:49:01.949 --> 00:49:08.065
So the law has to define
some--has to accept one of these

00:49:08.065 --> 00:49:09.050
points.
 

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:14.130
There's law has had a variety
of things.

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:19.320
What the law likes is what they
call a bright white line.

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:24.179
That it's clear to everybody
when you've crossed this line.

00:49:24.179 --> 00:49:27.512
Since the development of the
fetus in the uterus is

00:49:27.512 --> 00:49:30.913
continuous, there's no
particular point in time that

00:49:30.913 --> 00:49:34.206
you can say;
this stage is different than

00:49:34.206 --> 00:49:35.480
the day before.
 

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:39.291
No point during gestation would
be a bright white line that

00:49:39.291 --> 00:49:43.170
everyone agrees that it either
happened or didn't happen.

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:45.659
What they--the bright white
line today is birth;

00:49:45.659 --> 00:49:49.360
everybody knows when someone
has given birth.

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:54.081
I'll tell you in a moment that
in Jewish Rabbinic law it's even

00:49:54.081 --> 00:49:55.300
more specific.
 

00:49:55.300 --> 00:50:02.490
It's when half the head sticks
out--that's when birth happens,

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:07.090
that's when the fetus becomes a
baby.

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:11.777
Pretty much the courts have
stuck, so far in America,

00:50:11.777 --> 00:50:16.824
with this conclusion that birth
is the bright white line,

00:50:16.824 --> 00:50:19.710
everybody can agree on that.
 

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:23.201
There's also a fair amount of
religious opinion that

00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:26.077
quickening, that's another--at
least to the

00:50:26.077 --> 00:50:28.199
mother--identifiable event.
 

00:50:28.199 --> 00:50:30.300
Now an outside person can't
necessarily tell this,

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.523
but the mother does not know
whether she's pregnant until

00:50:33.523 --> 00:50:36.329
quickening,
until she feels the baby kick.

00:50:36.329 --> 00:50:38.873
She can miss a period but
there's a quite few reasons for

00:50:38.873 --> 00:50:40.690
missing a period other than
pregnancy.

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:44.865
Some of the earlier laws and
continuing into some of the

00:50:44.865 --> 00:50:48.815
abortion laws refer to
quickening as bright a line as

00:50:48.815 --> 00:50:50.030
you can get.
 

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:52.659
But there, the mother knows it
before everyone else.

00:50:52.659 --> 00:50:55.815
Eventually you can put your ear
or your hand to a pregnant

00:50:55.815 --> 00:50:58.806
woman's stomach and feel the
kicks but the mother knows

00:50:58.806 --> 00:50:59.360
early.
 

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.019
Since that happens over--in
different pregnancies over quite

00:51:03.019 --> 00:51:06.628
a wide range of time,
over actually a month to month

00:51:06.628 --> 00:51:09.880
and a half before the kicks
become sensible,

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:16.719
it's not a very good kind of a
line.

00:51:16.719 --> 00:51:22.268
Okay, so we so far have the
idea of the beginning of life is

00:51:22.268 --> 00:51:26.623
not a scientific idea,
it's very variable in cultures,

00:51:26.623 --> 00:51:30.375
and so we still haven't really
answered the question of why

00:51:30.375 --> 00:51:33.996
this idea that life begins
conception is such a prevalent

00:51:33.996 --> 00:51:35.420
idea in the West.
 

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:39.329
Again, other cultures have
different kinds of ideas.

00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:42.211
One thing of course that pops
up to mind is,

00:51:42.211 --> 00:51:45.228
is it biblical,
because so much of our culture

00:51:45.228 --> 00:51:47.239
comes from biblical ideas.
 

00:51:47.239 --> 00:51:52.244
Well you know what--what is
life--what does the Bible say

00:51:52.244 --> 00:51:54.480
about when life begins?
 

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.119
Anybody know?
 

00:51:56.119 --> 00:51:58.730
Nobody--there's all this
fundamentalism in America and

00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:59.420
nobody here.
 

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.389
Well what is the cycle of life
described in the Bible?

00:52:02.389 --> 00:52:06.134
This is common in literature;
any literature major should

00:52:06.134 --> 00:52:07.110
know this.
 

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:08.800
Dust to dust.
 

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.268
You've--how many of you have
heard dust to dust?

00:52:11.268 --> 00:52:16.500
Yeah, or sometimes translated
as earth to earth,

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.293
it's Genesis 2:7:
"God formed man of dust

00:52:19.293 --> 00:52:22.460
from the ground until he
returned to the ground,

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:25.157
for out of it you are taken,
you are dust and to dust you

00:52:25.157 --> 00:52:26.170
shall return."
 

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:28.780
That's the cycle of life.
 

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:33.148
If there's a beginning to the
cycle, at what age did God

00:52:33.148 --> 00:52:34.260
create Adam?
 

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:36.500
There's something moderately
explicit about that.

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.257
Created Adam in his own image,
well the image of God is

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:43.039
not--it's not a fertilized egg,
right?

00:52:43.039 --> 00:52:47.615
Whatever you perceive the image
of God, it's more or less an

00:52:47.615 --> 00:52:48.780
adult person.
 

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.605
Of course, right away Adam was
able to receive commandments to

00:52:51.605 --> 00:52:55.168
not eat the fruit and so forth,
and suddenly Eve was born out

00:52:55.168 --> 00:53:03.300
of his rib,
certainly not a two cell cycle.

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:08.059
Again, in the Old Testament
there's just no support

00:53:08.059 --> 00:53:12.628
whatsoever for the idea that,
as a biblical idea,

00:53:12.628 --> 00:53:15.960
that life begins at conception.
 

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:19.297
There is no--in the New
Testament the issue just doesn't

00:53:19.297 --> 00:53:20.329
come up at all.
 

00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:23.570
There's no statement about when
life begins.

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:27.431
We'll come to some statements
which are very loosely

00:53:27.431 --> 00:53:30.309
interpreted in that way in a
minute.

00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:32.059
Very interesting.
 

00:53:32.059 --> 00:53:34.954
There's two great Catholic and
then Christian because

00:53:34.954 --> 00:53:37.905
Christians have inherited most
of the theologians--St.

00:53:37.905 --> 00:53:38.851
Augustine and St.
 

00:53:38.851 --> 00:53:41.190
Thomas Aquinas,
you've heard of them.

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.438
St.
 

00:53:41.438 --> 00:53:45.079
Augustine came first in 300 and
something,

00:53:45.079 --> 00:53:48.322
and, in his Confessions,
he's interested in this

00:53:48.322 --> 00:53:51.121
question and he says,
"Tell me God,

00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:55.052
tell me whether there was some
period of my life which preceded

00:53:55.052 --> 00:53:55.940
my infancy.
 

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:59.096
Is this period that I spent in
my mother's womb,

00:53:59.096 --> 00:54:01.849
was I anywhere or any sort of a
person?

00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:05.336
I have no one able to tell me
that, neither my father nor my

00:54:05.336 --> 00:54:09.119
mother, nor the experience of
others, nor my own memory."

00:54:09.119 --> 00:54:13.789
Here's one of the greatest
Catholic saints and theologians,

00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:17.181
who's of course read the Bible,
knows it backwards and

00:54:17.181 --> 00:54:19.784
forwards,
and he is very well aware that

00:54:19.784 --> 00:54:23.268
there isn't information in that
to tell him that answer.

00:54:23.268 --> 00:54:26.215
The conclusion is,
that this isn't a really

00:54:26.215 --> 00:54:29.652
biblical, the idea that life
begins at conception,

00:54:29.652 --> 00:54:32.949
is not something that comes
from the Bible.

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:40.980
I'm going to switch a little
bit and come back to this--these

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:42.219
kinds of thoughts.
 

00:54:42.219 --> 00:54:47.079
A little bit of the history of
abortion.

00:54:47.079 --> 00:54:50.840
Abortion has been known in
history as far as back as we can

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.360
trace.
 

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:54.695
The oldest reference is from
Egyptian hieroglyphs in tomb

00:54:54.695 --> 00:54:57.496
paintings, so we're talking
about the very early

00:54:57.496 --> 00:54:58.510
civilization.
 

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:02.989
As soon as people can write,
they're writing about abortion.

00:55:02.989 --> 00:55:06.563
By the time of the Roman Empire
there were lots of references to

00:55:06.563 --> 00:55:10.079
abortion in the literature and
there are no laws against it.

00:55:10.079 --> 00:55:13.469
The Romans didn't consider it.
 

00:55:13.469 --> 00:55:16.822
As I've just mentioned,
in the New Testament,

00:55:16.822 --> 00:55:20.938
it's not mentioned at all and
there's of course nothing

00:55:20.938 --> 00:55:22.309
forbidding it.
 

00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:26.449
The New Testament and the Roman
Empire are contemporaneous of

00:55:26.449 --> 00:55:28.572
course,
and so the conclusion is that,

00:55:28.572 --> 00:55:33.054
even though abortion was very,
very common at that time and

00:55:33.054 --> 00:55:40.945
used by all classes of people,
there was not an issue for the

00:55:40.945 --> 00:55:44.409
New Testament writers.
 

00:55:48.039 --> 00:55:51.878
At the end of the Roman--this
classical period,

00:55:51.878 --> 00:55:56.800
this Judeo-Christian way of
thinking about things comes into

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.389
the mainstream of Western
civilization.

00:56:00.389 --> 00:56:04.768
There is an explicit passage
about abortion in the Old

00:56:04.768 --> 00:56:05.760
Testament.
 

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:10.003
Don't call it out but anybody
knows--at least one person ought

00:56:10.003 --> 00:56:12.159
to know what this passage is.
 

00:56:12.159 --> 00:56:19.230
One, two, so it's a very,
very minor number of people.

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:21.902
The Ten Commandments,
which you all know,

00:56:21.902 --> 00:56:25.710
and you all know this passage
also, but I'll get to it.

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:28.594
The Ten Commandments are in
Exodus 20 and the sixth of the

00:56:28.594 --> 00:56:29.858
commandments,
as you know,

00:56:29.858 --> 00:56:31.630
"you shalt not kill".
 

00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:32.889
What does this mean?
 

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:34.340
What do all these laws mean?
 

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:37.768
In the following chapters,
there's an explanation of how

00:56:37.768 --> 00:56:39.389
to interpret these laws.
 

00:56:39.389 --> 00:56:41.911
There's various violent acts
that men do and which ones are

00:56:41.911 --> 00:56:42.389
accepted.
 

00:56:42.389 --> 00:56:43.789
May you beat your slave?
 

00:56:43.789 --> 00:56:44.760
May you kill your slave?
 

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.250
May you do this,
may you do that?

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:47.860
And there's a lot of
jurisprudence in there.

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:51.005
What do these one sentence Ten
Commandments ,

00:56:51.005 --> 00:56:54.724
what do they--how do you
interpret them in particular

00:56:54.724 --> 00:56:55.440
cases?
 

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.708
In Exodus 21,
for instance,

00:56:56.708 --> 00:56:58.268
what to do in cases of murder?
 

00:56:58.268 --> 00:57:01.070
What if one man hits another
with a stone or his fist?

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:02.349
What if a man kills his servant?
 

00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:05.230
What if a man kills a thief?
 

00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:09.702
All of this exegesis;
in this passage where it's

00:57:09.702 --> 00:57:14.190
explaining the Ten Commandments,
including thou shalt not kill;

00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:18.853
it describes a crime that is
much worse than a modern

00:57:18.853 --> 00:57:19.840
abortion.
 

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.489
In a modern abortion,
a woman, for whatever reason,

00:57:22.489 --> 00:57:24.079
doesn't want to be pregnant.
 

00:57:24.079 --> 00:57:28.139
She goes to a doctor and says,
'please doc I want an abortion,

00:57:28.139 --> 00:57:31.960
I don't want to be pregnant and
here's $150 or $200 or whatever

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.644
it costs,
and please do this for me,' so

00:57:35.644 --> 00:57:39.670
it's voluntary on the part of
the woman.

00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:44.545
This passage in the Bible
describes a worse situation

00:57:44.545 --> 00:57:48.954
where a man violently,
against the woman's will,

00:57:48.954 --> 00:57:52.329
causes her to miscarry or
abort.

00:57:52.329 --> 00:57:54.565
This is the quote,
"When men have a fight and

00:57:54.565 --> 00:57:57.349
hurt a pregnant woman so that
she suffers a miscarriage,"

00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:59.449
the man is fighting with the
woman there,

00:57:59.449 --> 00:58:03.730
so he goes after the wife
rather than the husband,

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:06.996
"When men fight and hurt a
pregnant woman so that she

00:58:06.996 --> 00:58:09.952
suffers a miscarriage,
but no further injury,

00:58:09.952 --> 00:58:14.036
the guilty one shall be fined
as much as the woman's husband

00:58:14.036 --> 00:58:17.704
demands of him and he shall pay
in the presence of the

00:58:17.704 --> 00:58:18.949
judges."
 

00:58:18.949 --> 00:58:22.492
Now that is a standard Hebraic,
Old Testament,

00:58:22.492 --> 00:58:24.619
law for a property crime.
 

00:58:24.619 --> 00:58:27.949
You do a crime,
everyone knows--they decide

00:58:27.949 --> 00:58:32.150
that you actually have stolen
this from the person.

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:36.809
The victim gets to say how much
is proper recompense for this.

00:58:36.809 --> 00:58:39.302
But, the victim can't ask for
anything outrageous,

00:58:39.302 --> 00:58:42.000
so a judge has to basically
approve the settlement.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.409
If the judge approves--you
steal something,

00:58:45.409 --> 00:58:47.518
well I want that same thing
back or ten times as much,

00:58:47.518 --> 00:58:50.090
or whatever it is,
goes before a judge,

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:52.119
the judge approves it,
if the judge approves it,

00:58:52.119 --> 00:58:54.820
it's paid, and that settles it.
 

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:58.416
That's what happens if the
fetus comes out,

00:58:58.416 --> 00:59:02.614
if there's this miscarriage but
no further injury,

00:59:02.614 --> 00:59:04.500
that's the result.
 

00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.239
But it continues,
the passage,

00:59:06.239 --> 00:59:09.539
"But if injury ensues you
shall give life for life,

00:59:09.539 --> 00:59:12.119
eye for eye,
and tooth for tooth."

00:59:12.119 --> 00:59:14.780
How many of you heard that
sentence?

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.420
Oh my gosh, that's everywhere
in Western civilization,

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.543
everybody should have heard
that, that's called the lex

00:59:19.543 --> 00:59:21.996
talionis,
the law of the claw sort of

00:59:21.996 --> 00:59:25.862
thing and it's very standard,
that retribution for

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:26.989
retribution.
 

00:59:26.989 --> 00:59:31.063
It's very, very interesting
because it says an eye for eye,

00:59:31.063 --> 00:59:34.014
life for life,
well is he talking about the

00:59:34.014 --> 00:59:35.630
baby or the mother?
 

00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:38.963
Life for life could be either
even though it says the baby is

00:59:38.963 --> 00:59:41.684
born already you can
still--people fiddle a little

00:59:41.684 --> 00:59:42.130
bit.
 

00:59:42.130 --> 00:59:43.596
Life for life,
eye for eye,

00:59:43.596 --> 00:59:46.530
and then what is the third
thing, tooth for tooth;

00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:49.050
that lets you know right away,
babies don't have teeth,

00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:52.670
that's sort of the one thing
that they're missing and the

00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:56.293
fact that this passage selects
that as the third thing to

00:59:56.293 --> 00:59:59.655
describe is a very clear
indication that it's not the

00:59:59.655 --> 01:00:03.260
fetus they're talking about,
but it's the mother.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.936
This is very;
very clear both from that--so

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:08.996
that if she suffers a
miscarriage, but no further

01:00:08.996 --> 01:00:11.420
injury then it's a property
crime.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.155
You've taken away something
that the father,

01:00:14.155 --> 01:00:16.827
in particular,
wanted and the father is the

01:00:16.827 --> 01:00:18.989
one that gets to decide on it.
 

01:00:18.989 --> 01:00:24.621
But, if you do damage to the
mother, then you have to really,

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:26.500
really pay for it.
 

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.737
That's the most explicit
passage in the Bible about

01:00:29.737 --> 01:00:33.362
abortion and it's totally clear
that it's the life of the

01:00:33.362 --> 01:00:36.451
mother,
the life and physical health of

01:00:36.451 --> 01:00:39.360
the mother that's the important
thing.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.000
The Jewish Talmudic Law,
which is not the Bible but

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.588
writing about it says,
"If a woman is in hard

01:00:45.588 --> 01:00:48.329
travail,
and her life cannot otherwise

01:00:48.329 --> 01:00:51.369
be saved,
one cuts up the child within

01:00:51.369 --> 01:00:56.590
her womb and extracts it member
by member because her life comes

01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:58.909
before that of the child.
 

01:00:58.909 --> 01:01:02.320
But, if the greater part of the
head was delivered,

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.012
one may not touch it,
for one may not set aside one

01:01:06.012 --> 01:01:09.409
person's life for the sake of
another."

01:01:09.409 --> 01:01:13.949
Again, a very explicit
statement that before birth,

01:01:13.949 --> 01:01:17.483
defined as half the head out,
it's the life of the mother is

01:01:17.483 --> 01:01:20.789
the only critical thing,
but once that birth has

01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:25.271
actually proceeded then they are
equal and you can't even save

01:01:25.271 --> 01:01:27.768
the mother's life in this case.
 

01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:31.443
What kind of procedure is this
describing that's become

01:01:31.443 --> 01:01:33.690
politically very important now?
 

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:34.750
Student:  Partial birth
abortion.

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:36.539
Prof: Partial birth
abortion.

01:01:36.539 --> 01:01:39.029
It's the-procedure that the
right-to-life people are very

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:39.829
much opposed to.
 

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:42.679
But, here it is,
from biblical scholars talking

01:01:42.679 --> 01:01:46.519
about it as when a woman is in
hard travail and there's nothing

01:01:46.519 --> 01:01:51.579
to do but that,
then you go ahead and do that.

01:01:51.579 --> 01:01:55.961
Of course this emphasis on the
mother is exactly what is

01:01:55.961 --> 01:01:59.309
reflected in the Supreme Court
decision.

01:01:59.309 --> 01:02:03.228
I've given you to read the
Roe v.

01:02:03.228 --> 01:02:08.715
Wade Decision,
and again, it's the mother that

01:02:08.715 --> 01:02:11.849
is the central interest.
 

01:02:11.849 --> 01:02:14.612
You may remember that the
Roe v.

01:02:14.612 --> 01:02:19.000
Wade divides up pregnancy
into three trimesters.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.824
The first three months,
the second three months,

01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:21.949
and the third three months.
 

01:02:21.949 --> 01:02:25.710
The first three months are
completely at the mother's

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:26.650
discretion.
 

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:30.056
The second three months the
state can put some controls on

01:02:30.056 --> 01:02:33.625
it and the third three months,
after the sixth month,

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:36.599
then the state has a lot of say
in this.

01:02:36.599 --> 01:02:39.713
The Supreme Court Decision is
kind of a balance,

01:02:39.713 --> 01:02:43.360
and why did they decide to
break it up by not halves?

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.889
Why into three months?
 

01:02:45.889 --> 01:02:51.599
That probably again comes--is a
biblical thing.

01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:54.809
One of the quotes that right to
lifers use a lot,

01:02:54.809 --> 01:02:58.489
and again you probably don't
know this, but go talk to a

01:02:58.489 --> 01:03:00.206
right to lifer;
if you're

01:03:00.206 --> 01:03:02.786
prochoice--whoever--whatever
side of this thing--talk

01:03:02.786 --> 01:03:04.869
seriously to someone on the
other side.

01:03:04.869 --> 01:03:08.349
It's very--it's always very
informative.

01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:12.887
There's this passage where
Elizabeth is pregnant with John

01:03:12.887 --> 01:03:17.585
the Baptist, and then Mary gets
pregnant and she goes to see

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:18.699
Elizabeth.
 

01:03:18.699 --> 01:03:21.958
John the Baptist,
inside Elizabeth's womb,

01:03:21.958 --> 01:03:23.230
jumps for joy.
 

01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:26.449
Have any of you heard this
passage used in these debates?

01:03:26.449 --> 01:03:28.934
Again, just a few of you,
it's a very,

01:03:28.934 --> 01:03:30.949
very standard sort of thing.
 

01:03:30.949 --> 01:03:34.918
It goes--it's in Luke,
"And when Elizabeth heard

01:03:34.918 --> 01:03:38.514
the greeting of Mary,
the babe leaped in her womb,

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:42.360
for behold when the voice of
your greeting came to my ears,

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.320
the babe in my womb leaped for
joy."

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.855
This is taken by right-to-life
people that the baby in the womb

01:03:49.855 --> 01:03:53.440
is already a sentient,
a person, a full person.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:56.603
Interestingly,
the story gives extra

01:03:56.603 --> 01:03:57.869
information.
 

01:03:57.869 --> 01:03:59.590
Zachariah, that's Elizabeth
husband,

01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:02.036
they're very religious and
they're old and they have no

01:04:02.036 --> 01:04:03.900
children,
but then God rewards their

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:05.880
goodness by making Elizabeth
pregnant.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.800
It's a recast of the Jacob
story where his wife

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:12.530
wasn't--couldn't get pregnant.
 

01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:15.099
"After these days his wife
Elizabeth conceived,

01:04:15.099 --> 01:04:16.929
and for five months she hid
herself"

01:04:16.929 --> 01:04:19.170
… "in the sixth
month Gabriel was sent

01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:21.092
…"
to announce to Mary that she

01:04:21.092 --> 01:04:23.518
would bear Jesus,
and the angel Gabriel

01:04:23.518 --> 01:04:27.255
explicitly explains to Mary that
Elizabeth is now six months

01:04:27.255 --> 01:04:28.786
pregnant,
"And behold,

01:04:28.786 --> 01:04:30.773
your kinswoman Elizabeth,
in her old age,

01:04:30.773 --> 01:04:34.489
has also conceived a son,
and this is the sixth month

01:04:34.489 --> 01:04:37.530
with her who was called
barren."

01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:41.505
It's amazing because the Bible
is not--in no other passage is

01:04:41.505 --> 01:04:44.420
it explicit about the stages of
pregnancy.

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:48.407
This repetition,
that at six months something

01:04:48.407 --> 01:04:51.760
special happens is very
diagnostic.

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.067
It is almost undoubtedly--they
don't explicitly say it--the

01:04:55.067 --> 01:04:58.431
reason why the Supreme Court
said to , instead of in halves,

01:04:58.431 --> 01:04:59.230
in thirds.
 

01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:02.001
The sixth month,
because that,

01:05:02.001 --> 01:05:07.733
in a sense, is in accordance
with one interpretation of these

01:05:07.733 --> 01:05:09.550
Bible passages.
 

01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:13.847
It also is scientifically
reasonable because it accords

01:05:13.847 --> 01:05:17.985
with the time when the fetus
does respond to external

01:05:17.985 --> 01:05:18.940
stimuli.
 

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:21.355
By six months,
if the mother gets excited or

01:05:21.355 --> 01:05:24.557
something, you can detect it in
the fetal heartbeat and so

01:05:24.557 --> 01:05:25.119
forth.
 

01:05:25.119 --> 01:05:28.027
If there's a physical bang or
something you can detect it in

01:05:28.027 --> 01:05:28.619
the fetus.
 

01:05:28.619 --> 01:05:32.400
So, at six months there's some
sort of responsiveness,

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.610
neuro-responsiveness going on
in the fetus.

01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:44.563
There's other passages and I
put them all in your reading

01:05:44.563 --> 01:05:45.280
packet.
 

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.985
I put the Exodus passage which
prochoice people refer to if

01:05:50.985 --> 01:05:55.018
they know it,
and the prolife passages.

01:05:55.018 --> 01:06:00.746
I put them all in your reading
packet and you can read them

01:06:00.746 --> 01:06:01.340
all.
 

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:05.059
Given the--basically the
silence, except for this

01:06:05.059 --> 01:06:08.148
explicit--
really except for the explicit

01:06:08.148 --> 01:06:12.320
passage in Exodus about the
criminal causing an abortion of

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.985
this woman,
the Bible is really quite

01:06:14.985 --> 01:06:16.380
silent on this issue.
 

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:19.480
Yet it's of theologically great
importance.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.617
So, what has happened is the
Christian theologians had to

01:06:22.617 --> 01:06:25.197
rely on the opinions of--
especially the ancient

01:06:25.197 --> 01:06:28.605
philosophers because when they--
this all started in the Roman

01:06:28.605 --> 01:06:31.467
Empire those were the
philosophers that were of

01:06:31.467 --> 01:06:32.340
importance.
 

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:35.869
As I mentioned to you,
Aristotle argued that the

01:06:35.869 --> 01:06:40.378
matter of the fetus came from
menstrual blood and--but it got

01:06:40.378 --> 01:06:41.579
interesting.
 

01:06:41.579 --> 01:06:44.641
After the discharge is over,
so he thought pregnancy started

01:06:44.641 --> 01:06:46.460
after menstrual flow had
stopped.

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:49.219
So, in a cycle where there was
a menstrual flow,

01:06:49.219 --> 01:06:52.336
he says, "After the
discharge is over and most of it

01:06:52.336 --> 01:06:55.148
has passed out,
then what remains begins to

01:06:55.148 --> 01:06:57.090
take shape as a fetus."
 

01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:59.947
The female menstrual blood,
however, is incapable of doing

01:06:59.947 --> 01:07:00.800
this by itself.
 

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.409
It must have the stimulus of
the male semen."

01:07:03.409 --> 01:07:06.867
They didn't know anything about
sperms at that time but they of

01:07:06.867 --> 01:07:10.101
course did know about semen,
and they knew that intercourse

01:07:10.101 --> 01:07:11.050
was required.
 

01:07:11.050 --> 01:07:13.510
What it did they had no clue.
 

01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:16.329
Male semen does not contribute
to the material of the fetus.

01:07:16.329 --> 01:07:19.246
He wondered what guided the
development of the blood in the

01:07:19.246 --> 01:07:22.173
fetus,
and the thought there must be

01:07:22.173 --> 01:07:27.208
some agent that is introduced by
the sperm which causes this

01:07:27.208 --> 01:07:30.110
coagulating blood to take form.
 

01:07:30.110 --> 01:07:34.682
He, according to Greek word for
this which later gets translated

01:07:34.682 --> 01:07:39.110
as 'soul,' and the Western idea
of soul really comes from this

01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:42.068
Greek,
this Aristotelian image of

01:07:42.068 --> 01:07:45.889
whatever it is that comes in the
semen that--

01:07:45.889 --> 01:07:48.730
does not contribute physically
to it,

01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:51.070
but organizes this whole thing.
 

01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:55.889
Much later in the 1500s and
1600s, when these issues became

01:07:55.889 --> 01:08:00.208
hot again, this is one of the
pictures of Aristotle's

01:08:00.208 --> 01:08:01.289
coagulum.
 

01:08:01.289 --> 01:08:05.117
So, this is the womb,
and inside this stuff is

01:08:05.117 --> 01:08:09.030
mother's menstrual blood as it
is presumed,

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:12.530
and it's gradually getting
organized so you really can't

01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:15.139
see much of the organization in
there,

01:08:15.139 --> 01:08:19.060
but what you can see is the
blood vessels starting to form.

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:24.350
If, in fact you do dissections
of a fetus,

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.996
the first thing that forms is
the placenta and this is the

01:08:26.996 --> 01:08:29.689
most obvious thing is the blood
vessels of the placenta.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.296
The mother has half the
placenta and the fetus has half

01:08:32.296 --> 01:08:34.152
the placenta,
as I hope you know,

01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:37.570
and that's where nutrients get
exchanged and waste gets taken

01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:37.970
out.
 

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:44.069
Then I guess in the original,
somehow you could see that

01:08:44.069 --> 01:08:51.055
there was a gradual formation of
the fetus but finally the fetus

01:08:51.055 --> 01:08:56.823
forms as some sort of
coagulation of this blood under

01:08:56.823 --> 01:09:00.038
the influence of semen.
 

01:09:00.038 --> 01:09:09.788
These--you all know this story,
so we now interpret conception.

01:09:09.788 --> 01:09:11.779
Conception is actually a very
vague word,

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:15.202
and I have it in here but there
isn't time to read you what the

01:09:15.202 --> 01:09:17.189
Catholic encyclopedia says it
is,

01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:19.747
and it's very,
very complicated and it's not

01:09:19.747 --> 01:09:21.649
anything that you think it is.
 

01:09:21.649 --> 01:09:25.809
We interpret now as more
educated--how do we interpret

01:09:25.809 --> 01:09:26.828
conception?
 

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:29.810
We use it as the same idea as
fertilization.

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:33.158
Do any of you make a
distinction between conception

01:09:33.158 --> 01:09:34.500
and fertilization?
 

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:38.470
No, I'm not going to ask the
opposite question.

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:41.529
Fertilization is the specific
current scientific concept.

01:09:41.529 --> 01:09:44.738
Conception is an old thing,
something undefined,

01:09:44.738 --> 01:09:48.903
that an act of intercourse is
needed, and ejaculation of sperm

01:09:48.903 --> 01:09:51.430
is needed, and something goes
on.

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:58.220
Unknown, but something goes on
and that leads to conception.

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:02.198
Our current interpretation of
this as fertilization is often

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:05.164
now taken to be the traditional
Western view,

01:10:05.164 --> 01:10:07.658
the traditionally Christian
view.

01:10:07.658 --> 01:10:11.670
When was fertilization
discovered?

01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:14.460
When were sperms discovered?
 

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.550
I think you know this.
 

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:19.105
What's the name,
the person who

01:10:19.105 --> 01:10:22.090
discovered--invented
microscopes?

01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:25.260
Anthony van Leeuwenhoek,
you've heard of Leeuwenhoek?

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:27.408
I'm sure in high school you
went through this.

01:10:27.408 --> 01:10:29.510
He was the one that first found
little animalcules,

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:33.024
he took drops of water
and--from ponds and looked at it

01:10:33.024 --> 01:10:36.996
and saw all these little things
swimming around and he defined

01:10:36.996 --> 01:10:39.600
them as animalcules,
little animals.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.365
Then he looked in sperm and
there were these little things

01:10:42.365 --> 01:10:43.238
swimming around.
 

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:46.420
Apparently, I'm not sure that
this is proper history,

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:49.698
the spice trade was real
important back then and they

01:10:49.698 --> 01:10:53.609
wanted to know what it was that
gave spice its tangy flavor.

01:10:53.609 --> 01:10:56.670
So he invented the microscope
to look at spice so to see--

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:58.823
because it was very expensive
to get spice all the way from

01:10:58.823 --> 01:11:01.065
the Middle East,
going through mostly Muslim

01:11:01.065 --> 01:11:02.871
countries,
who charged a lot to passage

01:11:02.871 --> 01:11:05.234
it, and so it was very expensive
and they wanted to know the

01:11:05.234 --> 01:11:07.720
secret of spice and they thought
there was something in it.

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.399
So, he invented the microscope
to look at that,

01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:12.345
but what he found was little
animalcules and he eventually

01:11:12.345 --> 01:11:14.979
looks at sperm and he sees the
animalcules in it.

01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:16.100
What does he do?
 

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.908
He interprets it as the same
animalcules as in the water.

01:11:18.908 --> 01:11:21.987
Well the sperm is made of
something--I'm sorry the semen

01:11:21.987 --> 01:11:25.288
is made of something and these
sperm are little contaminants

01:11:25.288 --> 01:11:26.800
which are eating it up.
 

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:32.659
They're just like the little
guys you saw on anything that

01:11:32.659 --> 01:11:34.100
was rotting.
 

01:11:38.698 --> 01:11:45.252
That was a sperm,
but they didn't have any idea

01:11:45.252 --> 01:11:47.960
of what it meant.
 

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.387
Then, it was much later--they
didn't see human eggs in

01:11:51.387 --> 01:11:53.497
mammals,
even mammal eggs that--You can

01:11:53.497 --> 01:11:56.087
see eggs of chickens,
you can see eggs of insects,

01:11:56.087 --> 01:11:57.390
they're pretty obvious.
 

01:11:57.390 --> 01:12:00.884
You can see eggs of fish,
they're pretty obvious,

01:12:00.884 --> 01:12:05.180
but the egg of a mammal is so
tiny that it can't be seen.

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:08.260
It was actually William--there
were a number of guys who,

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:11.430
sort of gradually saw it and
gradually realized what it was,

01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:14.099
but William Harvey,
the same guy that saw the

01:12:14.099 --> 01:12:17.029
circulation--
that figured out the

01:12:17.029 --> 01:12:23.288
circulation of blood was one of
the first ones to see an egg.

01:12:23.288 --> 01:12:26.840
They just knew about an egg and
they said, well that sort of got

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.390
rid of this blood coagulum stuff
and they still had no idea what

01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:31.350
was in semen.
 

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:34.667
Even though they saw sperms,
they didn't know that there was

01:12:34.667 --> 01:12:37.372
an egg,
so it wasn't until 1840s that

01:12:37.372 --> 01:12:41.436
finally fertilization was
discovered in mammals and that

01:12:41.436 --> 01:12:45.501
it was actually the physical
matter of the sperm and the

01:12:45.501 --> 01:12:49.270
physical matter of the egg that
come together.

01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:53.000
The conclusion of all this is
that the culture,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.800
our culture,
and especially the religious

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.987
parts of it,
believe that life begins at

01:12:58.987 --> 01:13:03.420
conception and believe that this
is a traditional idea.

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.146
That it goes way back to the
beginning of Christianity and

01:13:06.146 --> 01:13:07.198
even into the Bible.
 

01:13:07.198 --> 01:13:10.194
But, in fact,
the whole idea of fertilization

01:13:10.194 --> 01:13:13.939
only dates from 1840 and so it's
a very modern idea,

01:13:13.939 --> 01:13:15.930
and the whole--And then going
further,

01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:20.774
the whole idea of life having a
beginning just doesn't make any

01:13:20.774 --> 01:13:25.618
scientific sense because we know
and have known for hundreds of

01:13:25.618 --> 01:13:28.038
years that life is a cycle.
 

01:13:28.038 --> 01:13:29.832
There is much more,
you have some very interesting

01:13:29.832 --> 01:13:31.734
reading on this topic,
and there's infinite amount of

01:13:31.734 --> 01:13:32.979
reading that you can do on it.
 

01:13:32.979 --> 01:13:36.600
That's all I'll say on it for
today.

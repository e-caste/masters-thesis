00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.750
Prof: Last time,
I was arguing with you about

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.115
some of the novelties that Dante
introduces within the poem at

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:18.100
the start of Purgatory.
 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:25.573
One--there's some formal,
what we would call descriptive

00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:31.960
novelties: light,
time, the question of time.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.395
There's a moral innovation,
the focus on the connection,

00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:45.300
the subtle connection between
freedom and new beginnings.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.960
The idea of freedom as,
first of all,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.430
a political value,
and the meeting with Cato,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.738
so that though insisting on
these novelties and that the

00:00:59.738 --> 00:01:04.186
novelty and the new,
or the possibility of renewal

00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:08.840
is exactly what's at stake in
Dante's new poetics.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.275
I was also trying to emphasize,
and I think that that came

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:15.141
through,
hopefully with clarity,

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:19.739
the whole tension between the
old and the new,

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:25.173
the pull of the past,
the sense of nostalgia and

00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:32.920
whether it's an existential one
or in the biblical Exodus story,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.250
the nostalgia for the time of
safety,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.220
apparent safety in--of the Jews
in Egypt,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.010
even though within--under the
slavery that Egypt stands for.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.492
These were some of the issues
and then we moved onto Canto II

00:01:52.492 --> 00:01:56.976
where we specifically,
on the encounter of Dante with

00:01:56.976 --> 00:01:59.772
a musician,
by the name of Casella,

00:01:59.772 --> 00:02:02.590
where Dante dramatizes,
as if unaware,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.638
as if mindless of what had
happened in the previous canto

00:02:06.638 --> 00:02:09.889
and the experience of the
previous canto,

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:14.688
he just lapses into exactly the
same type of predicament that

00:02:14.688 --> 00:02:17.408
the previous canto had featured.
 

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:22.906
Namely, here he is indulging in
memories of the past,

00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:28.720
lapsing into a form of
idolatrous self-confrontation.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.628
He's listening to the beauty
and lure of the canto--

00:02:32.628 --> 00:02:36.960
of the song that Casella will
sing for him and then,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.824
finally, the presence of--the
eruption of Cato once again who

00:02:42.824 --> 00:02:47.318
focuses on the ethical demands
of the place.

00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:53.071
Purgatory is a place of moral
purification and so he urges all

00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:58.538
the souls that had gathered
around the song of Casella,

00:02:58.538 --> 00:03:01.352
to move away,
and the language that he uses

00:03:01.352 --> 00:03:03.830
is that of dispersion:
like doves,

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.044
like pigeons,
like doves that go on

00:03:07.044 --> 00:03:10.258
dispersing throughout the plain.
 

00:03:10.258 --> 00:03:15.650
Clearly what--in retrospect,
what is apparent,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.658
I think, in all of these
situations,

00:03:18.658 --> 00:03:23.188
is Dante's insistence on the
power,

00:03:23.188 --> 00:03:29.038
on the importance of a communal
destiny, a communal fate.

00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:34.840
Though this communal fate
appears as defeated.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.300
Let me just explain what I mean
and then we move on with today's

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.080
readings.
 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.115
In the case of Cato,
Cato has been defeated by the

00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:49.056
civil war between Pompey and
Caesar, to the point that he had

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:50.870
to commit suicide.
 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.211
In the case of Casella's song,
that poem had managed to gather

00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:58.520
around itself,
not only Dante,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.745
but all the other souls who had
become mindless of what they

00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:05.479
really were supposed to do,
continue their climbing up the

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.158
mountain.
 

00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:11.332
And Cato intervenes and he also
shatters the--as illusory that

00:04:11.332 --> 00:04:13.030
form of community.
 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.302
What I think that Dante's after
is the following:

00:04:17.302 --> 00:04:22.466
there may have been defeat and
therefore the value of these

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:25.939
experiments in communal
existence,

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.053
that of Cato who commits
suicide, and that of the

00:04:29.053 --> 00:04:31.649
aesthetic gathering around the
poetry.

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:36.000
They are both partially
defeated, and yet they contain

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.846
seeds that will be necessary for
his rethinking about how to

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:45.279
renew and reconstruct his idea
of the common historical

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.430
destiny.
 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.108
This is really what--and I hope
it's fairly clear and we shall

00:04:51.108 --> 00:04:53.639
see this a little bit on today.
 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.440
I turn very briefly now to
Canto V,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.379
for a couple of reasons because
it's--

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.149
Canto V, if I had to give a
general title to the canto,

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:08.266
I would say that this deals
with Dante's sense of

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:11.040
retrospective knowledge.
 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.689
I have been really focusing on
a Dante turned to the future,

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.225
as you know,
a Dante who thinks and reflects

00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:21.579
on hope,
who thinks and reflects about

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:26.220
issues such as the future in
general,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.144
that this is freedom is--and
time as the future is the real

00:05:31.144 --> 00:05:31.740
time.
 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.906
Nothing else really matters
because everything else can only

00:05:34.906 --> 00:05:37.000
be understood as part of the
future,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.178
even when it's past,
with the logical underlying

00:05:40.178 --> 00:05:44.100
assumption that that which is
past was once the future,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.550
the only real--the only reality
of time.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.235
He understands in
Purgatorio how time moves

00:05:50.235 --> 00:05:53.720
in a uni-direction,
which is future oriented,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.209
so it's really a time as
future,

00:05:56.209 --> 00:06:00.050
that it turns out to be also a
return to the Garden of Eden,

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.870
but that is kind of second
thought for him.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.112
Here now though,
in Canto V, Dante meets souls

00:06:08.112 --> 00:06:14.240
that the--bring to the fore for
him the power of retrospection.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.709
These are souls who manage to
repent at the last minute.

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:23.630
It's almost as if--again,
it's time, it's a question of

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.189
time, but a time that is sort of
inexhaustible.

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:30.791
It's always possible to fall
back, reflect,

00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.279
and turn one's life around.
 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:37.017
One figure that he meets,
and this is Canto V around line

00:06:37.017 --> 00:06:40.290
90, you shall see in a moment
why I select him.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:47.913
He meets a figure who is--he'll
identify himself Buonconte da

00:06:47.913 --> 00:06:51.567
Montefeltro,
who is the son by the way,

00:06:51.567 --> 00:06:54.714
of a man Guido,
whom we met in Canto XXVII of

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:57.502
Inferno,
and this is why I like to focus

00:06:57.502 --> 00:06:57.920
on him.
 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.819
The break between the past and
the future,

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.970
the son being always a sort of
statement about a project,

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.199
about a future--son or the
daughter--

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:14.079
a statement about the future
and the father ends up in Hell.

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:17.819
The son ends up in this
purgatorial ledge on the way to

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.641
redemption,
so there is no chain of natural

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:27.439
necessity and causality between
the past and the present and the

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:28.360
future.
 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.918
There is a focus on freedom,
because once you break that

00:07:32.918 --> 00:07:36.220
bond of necessity,
you are really opening up,

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.680
inaugurating the idea that we
are free,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.392
that we are really free to make
ourselves regardless of what

00:07:42.392 --> 00:07:44.660
antecedents we may have behind
us.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.389
There is another little detail,
which is a formal--

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:49.240
it really tells you something
about Dante's art,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.365
so here he goes on in line 88
or so: "Then another spoke:

00:07:55.365 --> 00:08:01.290
'Pray so may that desire be
satisfied with draws thee to the

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.300
high mountain...
 

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.363
" What extraordinary
language about desire drawing

00:08:07.363 --> 00:08:07.740
us.
 

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.949
We are--this is Dante's
universe of desire.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:14.447
We're impelled by desire,
and desire is really what moves

00:08:14.447 --> 00:08:14.759
us.
 

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:19.738
It's love that moves us;
it's desire that impels us to

00:08:19.738 --> 00:08:21.720
go one way or the other.
 

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.519
"...
 

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:25.899
do thou with gracious pity help
mine.

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:30.509
I was of Montefeltro;
I am Buonconte."

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:34.184
And I hope now that you are
sensitive to this temporal,

00:08:34.184 --> 00:08:37.178
to the tenses,
the disjunction in tenses.

00:08:37.178 --> 00:08:41.477
I already pointed those out for
you in the canto of Ugolino and

00:08:41.477 --> 00:08:45.224
here too,
Buonconte is asserting his

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:51.501
identity in the mode of the
present and detaching himself

00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:58.004
with the view or the use of the
past tense from the family,

00:08:58.004 --> 00:08:59.908
Montefeltro.
 

00:08:59.908 --> 00:09:02.940
"Neither Giovanna nor any
other has care for me,

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.678
so that I go among these with
downcast brow.'

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:11.033
And I said to him,
'What force or what

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:16.388
chance,"
or 'adventure' more than

00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:18.269
'chance.'
 

00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:22.432
Chance is too heavy a word and
I will come to this a little bit

00:09:22.432 --> 00:09:25.788
later where Dante reflects on
the significance,

00:09:25.788 --> 00:09:29.129
which has "took thee so
far from Campaldino,

00:09:29.129 --> 00:09:31.000
that thy burial place was never
known."

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.754
This is an extraordinary scene,
an extraordinary encounter for

00:09:34.754 --> 00:09:36.908
one very autobiographical
reason.

00:09:36.908 --> 00:09:40.230
The reason is this,
is that Dante fought at the

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.889
battle of Campaldino.
 

00:09:41.889 --> 00:09:45.029
It was the moment his great
maturity,

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:49.330
his great entering into the
battlefield of life,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.892
when he discovers that now,
because of the victory that the

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:56.854
Florentines had in Campaldino,
that he also can have claims

00:09:56.854 --> 00:09:59.438
about himself,
about his own family,

00:09:59.438 --> 00:10:00.990
and political future.
 

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.298
But now he meets a victim.
 

00:10:03.298 --> 00:10:06.975
And there have been those who
go on claiming with very little

00:10:06.975 --> 00:10:09.418
evidence,
if you are in a battle--I don't

00:10:09.418 --> 00:10:12.230
know how many of you know the
field of Campaldino;

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:19.203
it's pretty large,
about twenty-five miles east of

00:10:19.203 --> 00:10:20.769
Florence.
 

00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:24.749
The idea is that--so those who
go on claiming that maybe this

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:27.798
is someone that Dante killed at
the battle,

00:10:27.798 --> 00:10:31.389
and now sort of retrieves him,
brings him back--

00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:34.298
there's no evidence for
this--but it is a painful

00:10:34.298 --> 00:10:36.360
autobiographical moment for him.
 

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.307
A moment where he did
experience violence and he

00:10:39.307 --> 00:10:40.750
perpetrated violence.
 

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.844
And this is the answer:
"Ah, he replied,

00:10:42.844 --> 00:10:44.557
'at the foot of the
Casentino.'"

00:10:44.557 --> 00:10:47.129
Rather than answering the
question of the battle,

00:10:47.129 --> 00:10:51.379
he goes on thinking about his
death and recounts his death.

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:53.158
This is a poem about births.
 

00:10:53.158 --> 00:10:56.505
You remember,
I always like to say this about

00:10:56.505 --> 00:11:01.611
the event of being born,
and the portentous quality that

00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:05.794
being born implies,
the kinds of alterations that

00:11:05.794 --> 00:11:10.172
we all can bring on the world
around us by the very fact that

00:11:10.172 --> 00:11:11.340
we were born.
 

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.220
Now he talks about death.
 

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.621
"Ah he replied,
'at the foot of Casentino a

00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:18.485
stream crosses called the
Archiano, which rises above the

00:11:18.485 --> 00:11:20.070
Hermitage in the Apennines.
 

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.942
To the place where its name is
lost I came, wounded in the

00:11:23.942 --> 00:11:27.340
throat, flying on foot,
and bloodying the plain.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.308
There I lost sight and speech.
 

00:11:29.308 --> 00:11:33.633
I ended on the name of Mary and
there fell and only my flesh

00:11:33.633 --> 00:11:34.440
remained.
 

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.567
I will tell the truth and do
thou tell it again among the

00:11:37.567 --> 00:11:38.070
living.
 

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.409
God's angel took me,
and he from Hell cried:

00:11:40.409 --> 00:11:42.967
'O thou from Heaven,
why dost thou rob me?"

00:11:42.967 --> 00:11:43.730
And so on.
 

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.418
The reason why I'm really
reading this passage,

00:11:46.418 --> 00:11:50.456
not only to tell you about this
notion of the power of time and

00:11:50.456 --> 00:11:54.557
the power of retrospection,
looking back at that final

00:11:54.557 --> 00:11:59.114
moment in one's life,
it's the decisive moment that

00:11:59.114 --> 00:12:01.004
confers,
a coherence,

00:12:01.004 --> 00:12:03.360
and a meaning to one's life.
 

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.485
We were born,
and we are born with certain

00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:10.448
expectations of what we can do,
but death becomes the

00:12:10.448 --> 00:12:12.048
revelatory event.
 

00:12:12.048 --> 00:12:14.778
This is really the point of
this passage,

00:12:14.778 --> 00:12:16.690
but there's another point.
 

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.710
Dante deploys the same
rhetorical genre of the debate

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:26.537
which he had used in the
encounter with Buonconte's

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:27.600
father.
 

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.269
So that by the sameness of the
rhetorical genre,

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:33.759
you are forced to really couple
them together,

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:38.926
and yet the point is that of
the distance between father and

00:12:38.926 --> 00:12:41.409
son,
that of the distance in the

00:12:41.409 --> 00:12:45.152
temporal disjunctions between
the past and the present,

00:12:45.152 --> 00:12:46.399
and the future.
 

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:49.860
The canto ends with six lines
which are extraordinary lines,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:54.570
where sentimentalists as
occasionally I am,

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.957
we'll go on even seeing a
subtle allusion of Dante to his

00:12:58.957 --> 00:12:59.820
own wife.
 

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.220
It's an encounter with Pia de'
Tolomei,

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:09.177
a woman from Siena,
and clearly this little passage

00:13:09.177 --> 00:13:14.284
is meant to refocus--
remind us of Francesca in Canto

00:13:14.284 --> 00:13:16.200
V of Inferno.
 

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.908
It's the exact symmetrical
canto.

00:13:17.908 --> 00:13:21.649
These are the lines which I
will read, I will go on reading

00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:24.360
also in Italian,
you read it in English.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.523
Professor Margaret Brooks was
asking me to give some evidence

00:13:29.523 --> 00:13:33.308
of what the Italian language
sounds like,

00:13:33.308 --> 00:13:37.243
and so it's a moment of
nostalgia for you too,

00:13:37.243 --> 00:13:38.029
I take.
 

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:41.077
So, "Pray when thou hast
returned to the world and art

00:13:41.077 --> 00:13:43.969
rested from the long way,' the
third spirit followed the

00:13:43.969 --> 00:13:46.433
second,
do thou remember me who am La

00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:47.129
Pia."
 

00:13:47.129 --> 00:13:51.019
It's a sort of--an epitaph of
La Pia,

00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:55.544
who was mistreated here by the
husband and yet incredibly

00:13:55.544 --> 00:13:59.924
forgiving and the word ends--
and the passage ends with the

00:13:59.924 --> 00:14:02.769
word gem which in Italian is
gemma,

00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:06.090
Dante's wife's name.
 

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:10.294
So one wonders if Pia also
doesn't stand the kind of

00:14:10.294 --> 00:14:15.076
wishful thinking on the part of
Dante that his wife whom he

00:14:15.076 --> 00:14:18.072
had--
because of exile had been

00:14:18.072 --> 00:14:21.769
forced to leave behind may also
forgive.

00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:24.395
That's the point:
is Dante introducing this

00:14:24.395 --> 00:14:28.210
radical category of forgiveness,
which is the true scandal?

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.004
If you want to begin again,
then forgiveness is exactly

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:33.269
what's demanded.
 

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:35.639
Let me read the passage in
Italian and we move on.

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:39.225
"Deh,
quando tu sarai tornato al

00:14:39.225 --> 00:14:41.615
mondo, 
e riposato della lunga

00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:43.466
via," 
seguitò

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.580
'l terzo spirito al secondo

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.299
"ricorditi di me che
lon la Pia;

00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:52.928
Siena mi fé;
disfecemi Maremma:

00:14:52.928 --> 00:14:56.840
salsi colui che
'nnannelllata pria 

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.210
disposando m'avea con la sua
gemma."

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:05.308
Now we move to--after this
highly--I find it a passage of a

00:15:05.308 --> 00:15:09.529
great pathos--as all of them
are--great intimacy,

00:15:09.529 --> 00:15:12.519
where Dante's really involved.
 

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:15.788
And just as he's obliquely
involved with Buonconte,

00:15:15.788 --> 00:15:18.926
they fought in the same battle
on opposite sides,

00:15:18.926 --> 00:15:22.129
and then this encounter with
Pia de' Tolomei.

00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:26.720
We turn to a public canto,
a political canto.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.341
Let me just try to explain a
couple of things before we move

00:15:32.341 --> 00:15:37.489
on to something that I care
about here, in terms of the

00:15:37.489 --> 00:15:39.298
Canto X and XI.
 

00:15:39.298 --> 00:15:43.279
That's how he begins Canto VI,
political canto like Canto VI

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:46.720
of Inferno,
and like Canto VI of Paradise.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.202
You know that now,
it's a principle of symmetry at

00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:50.700
work.
 

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.634
This is not--Canto VI of
Inferno is about the city

00:15:53.634 --> 00:15:55.938
of Florence,
Canto VI of Purgatorio

00:15:55.938 --> 00:15:58.586
is about Italy,
and the disarray,

00:15:58.586 --> 00:16:02.720
the chaos, the disunity of the
country.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.840
Here he starts,
"When the game of hazard

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.960
breaks up the loser is left
disconsolate,

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.740
going over his throws again,
and sadly learns his lesson;

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.190
with the other all the people
go off;

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.205
one goes in front,
one seizes him from behind,

00:16:20.205 --> 00:16:23.690
another at his side recalls
himself to his memory;

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.706
he does not stop,
but listens to this one and

00:16:26.706 --> 00:16:29.434
that one;
each to whom he reaches his

00:16:29.434 --> 00:16:33.898
hand presses on him no longer
and so he saves himself from the

00:16:33.898 --> 00:16:34.629
throng.
 

00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:39.698
Such was I in that dense crowd,
turning my face to them this

00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:43.135
way and that,
and by promising I got free

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:44.340
from them.
 

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.200
There was the Aretine,"
and so on.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.418
It's an extraordinary simile.
 

00:16:48.418 --> 00:16:52.339
To explain, that's the burden
of the simile,

00:16:52.339 --> 00:16:57.807
that all the penitents are so
surprised at seeing Dante alive

00:16:57.807 --> 00:17:02.000
in the beyond,
that they all go after him.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.201
He is--there's a throng of
people pressing on him,

00:17:05.201 --> 00:17:06.509
that's the simile.
 

00:17:06.509 --> 00:17:10.111
The simile that he uses is that
of the winner in a game of

00:17:10.111 --> 00:17:10.680
hazard.
 

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.098
That is to say,
he is the winner.

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:16.577
Dante's the winner and they all
go after him,

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:18.950
and they all neglect Virgil.
 

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.230
Virgil is the loser.
 

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.540
Therefore, the simile
introduces a language which is

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.578
extraordinary.
 

00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:29.381
It is as if Dante were speaking
of his salvation,

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:33.816
of the uniqueness of this
journey that he is undertaking,

00:17:33.816 --> 00:17:36.430
in terms of a game of hazard.
 

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.946
We all have been thinking that
this is really a providential

00:17:39.946 --> 00:17:43.523
journey and now he is casting it
as if it were just a game of

00:17:43.523 --> 00:17:44.180
chance.
 

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.950
Here is the word chance that he
uses: hazard.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.748
It's an interesting metaphor,
first of all,

00:17:50.748 --> 00:17:55.180
from the point of view of the
language of play.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.960
This is playful.
 

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:03.718
It's a way of almost of casting
one's salvation as the casting

00:18:03.718 --> 00:18:05.269
of the dice.
 

00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:12.210
It's a lottery here that
someone loses and someone wins,

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:14.579
and Dante says,
well I was born after the

00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:17.673
incarnation,
so I had the possibility of

00:18:17.673 --> 00:18:20.450
saving myself and Virgil did
not.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.710
It's also an interesting
metaphor because it really

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:29.226
introduces the question of play
in Dante's theological

00:18:29.226 --> 00:18:32.307
perception,
and it's an issue that I will

00:18:32.307 --> 00:18:36.098
talk about much more extensively
when we reach Paradise.

00:18:36.098 --> 00:18:40.509
But one thing is clear:
that Dante understands that the

00:18:40.509 --> 00:18:44.019
relationship between--
and that's all I'm going to say

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:46.970
unless you press me a little
later but we'll talk more about

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.358
this metaphor--
Dante understands that the

00:18:50.358 --> 00:18:56.200
relationship between the soul
and God is a relationship shaped

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.255
by risk on both sides,
and that this idea of risk that

00:19:01.255 --> 00:19:05.642
would seem to be a blind casting
of the dice in effect

00:19:05.642 --> 00:19:10.608
constitutes the freedom that the
human beings can have in the

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.430
scheme of things.
 

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:16.865
The whole point of salvation
is, by using this language of

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:20.601
hazard and chance,
is rescued, it's disengaged

00:19:20.601 --> 00:19:23.830
from my--
the idea that God knows it all

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:27.301
and we are going to--
we are determined in what we

00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:27.960
are doing.
 

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.265
What Dante's saying,
by focusing on a time bound

00:19:31.265 --> 00:19:34.414
metaphor,
is that we are engaged in a

00:19:34.414 --> 00:19:39.881
risky relationship and as in our
relationship between God and the

00:19:39.881 --> 00:19:43.609
soul,
there is this element of danger.

00:19:43.609 --> 00:19:45.200
That's it, that's the metaphor.
 

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.660
To make it more precise so you
don't--

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.420
you know where I'll be going in
the days ahead,

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.990
whenever in antiquity,
they would discuss--

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:01.430
mainly Boethius is the most
important author--

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:07.950
the relationship between human
freedom and God's foreknowledge,

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:12.529
they would always present the
case to say that God is outside

00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:15.288
of time,
always says being outside of

00:20:15.288 --> 00:20:15.700
time.
 

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.960
All times converge in God,
and so that God sees all things

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.950
in the present so that should
really--

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.457
God is here,
it's a point of view which is

00:20:26.457 --> 00:20:30.733
transcendent and therefore
synoptic and we are in a

00:20:30.733 --> 00:20:33.130
diachronic world:
past,

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.846
present and future,
but everything is at the same

00:20:36.846 --> 00:20:37.390
time.
 

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:41.646
We think that we live in a
world where we do not know what

00:20:41.646 --> 00:20:43.440
tomorrow may bring us.
 

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.130
Whatever decisions we make now
have already been--

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.551
what kind of consequences,
whether they're unpredictable

00:20:49.551 --> 00:20:53.410
or they have been determined by
things that escape our control,

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:54.529
but God knows.
 

00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:59.582
And this is the Boethian scheme
of harmonizing God's

00:20:59.582 --> 00:21:02.950
foreknowledge and human freedom.
 

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:08.078
It doesn't take too much to
realize that this is really a

00:21:08.078 --> 00:21:13.209
little bit of a delusion,
because either I'm free or am I

00:21:13.209 --> 00:21:14.400
not free.
 

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.923
It may be that God knows it
all, but it doesn't mean that He

00:21:18.923 --> 00:21:21.068
wills that I do what I do.
 

00:21:21.068 --> 00:21:26.346
He knows but He does not will
it, and yet, He knows and I'm

00:21:26.346 --> 00:21:30.894
here and I don't know,
so my own freedom is still a

00:21:30.894 --> 00:21:33.259
little bit rhetorical.
 

00:21:33.259 --> 00:21:37.930
Dante does it differently:
it's a departure from Boethius.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:43.663
The relationship between God's
foreknowledge and the souls

00:21:43.663 --> 00:21:48.795
being in time is one that
introduces the question of

00:21:48.795 --> 00:21:54.551
chance and hazard,
and that involves both God and

00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:55.700
the soul.
 

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.779
To be very precise,
he doesn't say it here,

00:21:57.779 --> 00:22:00.009
and that's why I hesitate to
get into that.

00:22:00.009 --> 00:22:03.900
I would like to work with the
text to make this very clear.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:09.288
The issue is that in a love
relationship between God and the

00:22:09.288 --> 00:22:12.028
soul, we are always at risk.
 

00:22:12.028 --> 00:22:15.578
If you accept the principle of
a love economy,

00:22:15.578 --> 00:22:18.318
regulating the universe,
which Dante does,

00:22:18.318 --> 00:22:21.814
certainly does,
then you understand this notion

00:22:21.814 --> 00:22:27.289
of hazard in--
not as a principle of just

00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:35.318
chance in the sense of casual
blind randomness,

00:22:35.318 --> 00:22:41.210
but in the sense of this
risk--proposition risk element.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:45.728
Then the canto goes on--this
particular metaphor goes on with

00:22:45.728 --> 00:22:48.440
another meeting between two
poets.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.108
Yes?
 

00:22:51.108 --> 00:22:53.594
Student:
What do you mean by love

00:22:53.594 --> 00:22:54.103
economy?
 

00:22:54.103 --> 00:22:57.288
Prof: The economy of
love--the question--the

00:22:57.288 --> 00:23:00.920
clarification is what do I mean
by the love economy?

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.940
Dante's universe,
it's a universe of love and

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.058
that's how creation takes place,
the creation of the universe

00:23:08.058 --> 00:23:10.598
and the creation of human
beings.

00:23:10.598 --> 00:23:16.357
So we are--the involvement that
we--every soul has with God is

00:23:16.357 --> 00:23:17.680
one of love.
 

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.517
Just as in the relationship
between say, Beatrice and Dante,

00:23:21.517 --> 00:23:24.119
there is an element of risk in
loving.

00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:25.910
What is that risk in loving?
 

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.808
I can think of several.
 

00:23:27.808 --> 00:23:31.260
I think we are all grown ups to
understand that,

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.079
one loves and one may not be
reciprocated in love.

00:23:35.079 --> 00:23:36.430
That's a pretty bad risk.
 

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:40.142
Certainly, it's a risk of God
who creates and may not be

00:23:40.142 --> 00:23:41.865
loved,
which is the story of what

00:23:41.865 --> 00:23:43.895
disobedience is,
and certainly is the

00:23:43.895 --> 00:23:47.478
existential experience of human
beings to be involved with

00:23:47.478 --> 00:23:48.170
someone.
 

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.952
Either we love the wrong
person, then we say wisely I was

00:23:51.952 --> 00:23:53.710
loving the wrong person?
 

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.643
I'm being ironic with that idea
of wisdom or discovering that

00:23:57.643 --> 00:24:00.660
indeed in every relationship
there is time,

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.191
feelings change,
we have so many ways of

00:24:03.191 --> 00:24:04.490
thinking about it.
 

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:09.278
There is a--Dante's response is
look,

00:24:09.278 --> 00:24:13.640
he likes figures--we shall talk
about this--

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:19.359
like Francis who goes to pray
on the cliffs at night because

00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:25.176
he wants to dramatize the idea
that even a prayer puts you at

00:24:25.176 --> 00:24:29.250
risk of being hurt or not being
hurt,

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.586
of being disappointed,
of discovering that the world

00:24:32.586 --> 00:24:35.269
does not go the way you want it
to go,

00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:38.259
and that which is true in
prayer is true in love.

00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:40.269
That's all I was saying.
 

00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:43.759
I wasn't saying anything more
than that.

00:24:43.759 --> 00:24:46.213
In Canto VI also,
the political canto,

00:24:46.213 --> 00:24:49.000
there is an encounter between
two poets.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.170
One is Virgil with Sordello,
who is a Mantuan poet.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.672
They all share the same
birthplace, Mantua,

00:24:58.672 --> 00:25:00.588
across the centuries.
 

00:25:00.588 --> 00:25:03.788
They meet and the very idea of
Mantua,

00:25:03.788 --> 00:25:07.348
they ask Virgil,
Virgil starts saying,

00:25:07.348 --> 00:25:10.778
"Mantua--"
clearly playing with a famous

00:25:10.778 --> 00:25:15.000
epitaph,
I think, the line interrupts.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.301
There it says:
"Mantua made me,"

00:25:18.301 --> 00:25:22.732
the famous epitaph written
on--in Naples where Virgil is

00:25:22.732 --> 00:25:23.618
buried.
 

00:25:23.618 --> 00:25:31.226
"Mantua made me and the
south, Calabria,

00:25:31.226 --> 00:25:33.818
took me away.
 

00:25:33.818 --> 00:25:37.578
I sang the arms,"
the Aeneid,

00:25:37.578 --> 00:25:39.940
"the herds,"
the Georgics,

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.701
and the story about the
Bucolics,

00:25:41.701 --> 00:25:42.828
"the fields."
 

00:25:42.828 --> 00:25:45.650
It's just--in two lines the
account of his whole life.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:47.048
So he starts saying,
"Mantua."

00:25:47.048 --> 00:25:50.722
I think I'm alluding to this
birthplace--once again the

00:25:50.722 --> 00:25:53.240
birth--and Sordello and he
embrace.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.726
This embrace,
this existential encounter,

00:25:55.726 --> 00:25:58.646
this other little moment which
is insubstantial,

00:25:58.646 --> 00:26:01.009
because they can't really
embrace.

00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:05.376
They're spirits,
another failure after the one

00:26:05.376 --> 00:26:11.200
that we saw with Casella in
Canto II of Purgatorio.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:16.769
That triggers Dante's political
invective against Italy.

00:26:16.769 --> 00:26:19.690
It's the moment of--which I
will read very briefly.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:23.402
I mean I will not read the
whole thing but it's an

00:26:23.402 --> 00:26:27.569
invective--the kind of civic
sense of responsibility.

00:26:27.569 --> 00:26:30.990
"O Mantuan..."
 

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:34.854
This is line 75 of Canto VI:
"And the gentle leader

00:26:34.854 --> 00:26:38.222
began, 'Mantua";
and the shade who had been all

00:26:38.222 --> 00:26:40.710
rapt within himself,
sprang toward him from the

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.372
place where he was,
saying: "O Mantuan,

00:26:43.372 --> 00:26:45.700
I am Sordello of thy
city."

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:49.001
He's a Provençal poet,
but he wrote in

00:26:49.001 --> 00:26:51.630
Provençal and from
Mantua.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:52.288
"..
 

00:26:52.288 --> 00:26:55.170
.the one embraced the
other."

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.434
Look at this phrase,
which is extraordinary because

00:26:57.434 --> 00:26:59.392
in Italian,
now I feel that I can

00:26:59.392 --> 00:27:02.982
read--thanks to Margaret I can
read Italian as freely as I

00:27:02.982 --> 00:27:05.243
care,
e l'un e l'altro

00:27:05.243 --> 00:27:06.759
abbracciava.
 

00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:09.647
I'll return to this
construction in a moment,

00:27:09.647 --> 00:27:12.338
"the one embraced the
other."

00:27:12.338 --> 00:27:18.416
It's a phrase of reciprocity --
one embraced the other -- the

00:27:18.416 --> 00:27:22.470
reciprocity of affections across
time.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:29.130
Dante begins his incredible
vituperation,

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.065
his attack against enslaved
Italy and look:

00:27:33.065 --> 00:27:35.329
"Ah,
Italy enslaved,

00:27:35.329 --> 00:27:38.980
hostel of misery,"
a number of metaphors,

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.150
"ship without pilot in
great tempest,

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.750
no princess among the provinces
but a brothel!

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.914
So eager was that noble soul,
only for the dear name of his

00:27:48.914 --> 00:27:51.183
city,
to give welcome there to its

00:27:51.183 --> 00:27:54.672
citizen,
and now in thee thy living are

00:27:54.672 --> 00:28:00.534
never free from war and of those
who one wall and mote shut in

00:28:00.534 --> 00:28:03.608
one gnaws at the other."
 

00:28:03.608 --> 00:28:10.566
Another line that seems to have
a sort of grim version of the

00:28:10.566 --> 00:28:12.190
reciprocity.
 

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:16.538
Earlier one embraced the other,
now one gnaws at the other.

00:28:16.538 --> 00:28:19.519
If you look at the Italian,
it's really slightly different.

00:28:19.519 --> 00:28:22.170
The English doesn't give
that--this translation at least.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:28.759
Line 82, in te non stanno
sanza guerra li vivi tuoi,

00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:32.298
e l'un l'altro si rode.
 

00:28:32.298 --> 00:28:35.910
One has a reflexive form,
the other one does not,

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:39.652
and the moment of violence
Dante uses the verb "si

00:28:39.652 --> 00:28:43.671
rode" in the reflexive form
in order to imply that the

00:28:43.671 --> 00:28:47.828
exchange is an exchange that it
always turns on oneself.

00:28:47.828 --> 00:28:54.000
One knows that the other for
oneself, therefore it reverses

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.532
and denies the reciprocity,
the action of reciprocity

00:28:59.532 --> 00:29:03.470
indicated by the previous
phrase.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:08.558
I could also emphasize a couple
of details here,

00:29:08.558 --> 00:29:11.584
where Dante says:
"to give welcome there to

00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:15.265
its citizen,
and now in thee thy living are

00:29:15.265 --> 00:29:20.242
never free from war and of those
whom wall and moat shut

00:29:20.242 --> 00:29:21.328
in."
 

00:29:21.328 --> 00:29:26.160
It's a very--you do know that
the word for community,

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:31.653
which we always use,
community--it's a word that

00:29:31.653 --> 00:29:36.796
etymologically comes from the
Latin for wall,

00:29:36.796 --> 00:29:38.900
moenia.
 

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.930
Community meant,
and stems from,

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:46.133
a concept from the sharing of
walls, houses,

00:29:46.133 --> 00:29:50.630
piling, and built one on top of
the other.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.430
That's the idea of a community.
 

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:57.729
The shared walls of the city,
which here is now seen

00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:02.509
as--viewed as separating one
from the other.

00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:08.259
This will continue with the
lack of laws and the families,

00:30:08.259 --> 00:30:10.788
including the Montague's and
Capulets,

00:30:10.788 --> 00:30:13.900
for you Shakespeare lovers,
who are mentioned here,

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:21.365
and then Dante ends up with--on
line 125 with a returning to

00:30:21.365 --> 00:30:26.970
Florence and a little--
clearly bitter satire.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.871
"My Florence thou mayst
well be at ease with this

00:30:29.871 --> 00:30:32.499
digression,"
I'll come back to this metaphor

00:30:32.499 --> 00:30:34.782
in a moment,
"which does not touch thee

00:30:34.782 --> 00:30:37.009
thanks to thy people who are so
resourceful."

00:30:37.009 --> 00:30:40.933
Dante talks about Italy but it
turns to Inferno VI with

00:30:40.933 --> 00:30:42.798
the invocation of Florence.
 

00:30:42.798 --> 00:30:47.598
He's calling this poem,
this invective,

00:30:47.598 --> 00:30:50.327
a digression,
which literally means that it

00:30:50.327 --> 00:30:54.606
does not belong in the poem,
that Dante is stepping out of

00:30:54.606 --> 00:30:58.509
the economy of the poem,
and talking in his own voice.

00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:59.561
It's a digression.
 

00:30:59.561 --> 00:31:01.960
That's what we call a
digression, right?

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.340
You use a particular language
that doesn't really belong to

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:09.153
the general plot and theme,
but then the meaning of this

00:31:09.153 --> 00:31:12.941
digression is made really clear,
later, when he says,

00:31:12.941 --> 00:31:15.440
"which does not touch
thee."

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.808
How ironic.
 

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:19.952
Of course he's saying literally
in this digression,

00:31:19.952 --> 00:31:23.220
you are so much better than all
these other towns.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.480
That's the irony:
Florence is no better,

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.670
therefore this digression
doesn't really concern you.

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:33.092
It can also be understood in
another way, in another more

00:31:33.092 --> 00:31:35.538
tragic and more sinister way.
 

00:31:35.538 --> 00:31:39.915
This digression does not touch
you: my language will not affect

00:31:39.915 --> 00:31:40.338
you.
 

00:31:40.338 --> 00:31:46.807
The whole statement in all its
ambiguity becomes one of the

00:31:46.807 --> 00:31:53.388
reflection on the impotence of
the poetic language to affect

00:31:53.388 --> 00:31:57.909
the historical--
the unfolding of history,

00:31:57.909 --> 00:32:00.288
the ordering of the city.
 

00:32:00.288 --> 00:32:03.564
It is as if Dante,
were, here, that the

00:32:03.564 --> 00:32:08.648
relationship between the voice
of the poet and the political

00:32:08.648 --> 00:32:12.009
order is one of inevitable
rupture.

00:32:12.009 --> 00:32:15.298
Dante tries to improve and
change, that's clearly the

00:32:15.298 --> 00:32:19.844
thrust of the passage,
and the thrust of the invective

00:32:19.844 --> 00:32:24.528
also declares the powerlessness
in his doing so.

00:32:24.528 --> 00:32:29.481
We are doing very well with
time, so I have a chance to read

00:32:29.481 --> 00:32:30.910
a little scene.
 

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:34.528
Dante moves on talking about
the first night of

00:32:34.528 --> 00:32:39.169
Purgatorio will take
place and he takes refuge in the

00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:43.234
so-called Valley of the Princes,
where a new garden,

00:32:43.234 --> 00:32:45.788
another garden is going to be
described,

00:32:45.788 --> 00:32:51.757
which in many ways fulfills the
garden of Limbo in Canto IV of

00:32:51.757 --> 00:32:53.420
Inferno.
 

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.067
Dante has these motifs that
keep reappearing and here it's

00:32:57.067 --> 00:33:00.140
more than a natural beauty of
the place it's--

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.695
there are precious stones
implying that though

00:33:03.695 --> 00:33:08.200
Purgatorio is the world
of transition for transient

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.213
souls,
there is something abiding

00:33:11.213 --> 00:33:12.700
about this place.
 

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:18.333
Then Dante moves on,
I want to read a paragraph here

00:33:18.333 --> 00:33:22.308
with the meeting with the
princes.

00:33:22.308 --> 00:33:27.117
I want to read the first
passage which is the--an evening

00:33:27.117 --> 00:33:27.720
song.
 

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:34.718
Dante's--Dante the pilgrim now
is taken with nostalgia for his

00:33:34.718 --> 00:33:35.980
hometown.
 

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:41.720
It is the pilgrimage of desire,
which is the poem,

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.740
the poem of desire,
desire for God,

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.807
desire for Beatrice,
now turns into the desire for

00:33:48.807 --> 00:33:53.288
the comfort and the shelter of
the home he had lost.

00:33:53.288 --> 00:33:56.788
Listen to this passage,
it's written in many ways

00:33:56.788 --> 00:34:00.288
in--along the lines of
Provençal poetry of

00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:01.308
nostalgia.
 

00:34:01.308 --> 00:34:05.838
Listen to the assonances as
you--the first six,

00:34:05.838 --> 00:34:09.059
seven lines of Canto VIII,
listen to the assonances the

00:34:09.059 --> 00:34:12.518
chiastic structures of the
sounds of which I'm not going to

00:34:12.518 --> 00:34:14.980
point out to you,
you can do that on your own.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:20.820
Era già
l'ora che volge il disio

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:24.289
ai navicanti e 'ntenerisce il
core

00:34:24.289 --> 00:34:27.420
lo dì
c'han detto ai dolci amici

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.666
addio;
 e che lo novo peregrin

00:34:29.666 --> 00:34:33.570
d'amore
punge, se ode squilla di lontano

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.349
che paia il giorno pianger che
si more;

00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:39.030
quand' io incominciai a
render vano

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:45.246
l'udire e a mirare una de l'alme
surta, che l'ascoltar chiedea

00:34:45.246 --> 00:34:46.380
con mano.
 

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.320
Then here, I'm not going to be
able to read it,

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.090
but to tell you how the poem
should be read,

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.289
then they go and hear a hymn,
a medieval hymn,

00:34:53.289 --> 00:34:55.518
Te lucis ante
terminum,

00:34:55.518 --> 00:34:58.947
which, if we really had the
time, I would come to class with

00:34:58.947 --> 00:35:00.980
the whole Latin hymn because
we--

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.617
Dante gives only the first
three words but clearly we are

00:35:04.617 --> 00:35:08.969
supposed to hear the whole thing
about the dangers of the night,

00:35:08.969 --> 00:35:14.199
the sense that the night is
fraught with phantasms and that

00:35:14.199 --> 00:35:19.427
they will intrude on the powers
of judgments of the various

00:35:19.427 --> 00:35:21.530
souls,
Dante's own included.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:25.626
With Canto IX,
Dante moves from--as he does in

00:35:25.626 --> 00:35:29.175
every Canto IX,
marks the rupture from a

00:35:29.175 --> 00:35:33.090
particular area of the poem to
another.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.230
Remember Canto IX of
Inferno and the encounter

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:39.793
with--failed encounter with the
Medusa, the passage into the

00:35:39.793 --> 00:35:40.760
City of Dis.
 

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.137
Now with Canto IX,
Dante moves into Purgatory

00:35:44.137 --> 00:35:48.130
proper, and so we'll go with
Canto X, XI, and XII.

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.659
We're not going to be able to
do all three cantos today,

00:35:50.659 --> 00:35:54.795
so I will return to some of the
things that I will say now about

00:35:54.795 --> 00:35:57.289
Canto X and XI that I hope to
cover.

00:35:57.289 --> 00:36:01.596
How is Purgatorio--where
is this purification proper

00:36:01.596 --> 00:36:03.230
going to take place?
 

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.518
This is the ordering.
 

00:36:04.518 --> 00:36:09.309
Dante will go these so-called
seven deadly sins.

00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:11.000
I don't know that you know what
they are,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.070
but the first one we shall see,
the first one is--

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:18.969
they go from spiritual sins,
pride is the root of all sins,

00:36:18.969 --> 00:36:23.139
to lust at the end.
 

00:36:23.139 --> 00:36:30.150
In every representation of this
sin,

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:34.630
Dante precedes it with a
representation of its opposite

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:38.530
virtue: so that we have humility
in Canto X,

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:41.630
and then in Canto XI punished
pride.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.559
First of all,
as if Dante has to learn that

00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:47.699
which he's going to witness a
little later.

00:36:47.699 --> 00:36:52.786
In a sense, it's the absolute
reversal of the economy of

00:36:52.786 --> 00:36:56.300
Inferno in
Purgatorio.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:00.802
You may remember that I said
last time that the incredible

00:37:00.802 --> 00:37:05.621
quality of the structure of the
poem is that Dante wants us to

00:37:05.621 --> 00:37:09.809
see experiences of evil in
Inferno first,

00:37:09.809 --> 00:37:11.827
so that when we get to
Purgatorio and

00:37:11.827 --> 00:37:14.764
Paradise,
we really have the chance to

00:37:14.764 --> 00:37:19.219
appreciate what the good is and
appreciate what the absence of

00:37:19.219 --> 00:37:23.434
the good may be,
but evil really generates and

00:37:23.434 --> 00:37:24.480
engenders.
 

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.690
Here now, he changes all of
this.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.572
In Purgatorio,
he starts with the

00:37:29.572 --> 00:37:34.010
representation of the virtue of
humility and then the sin.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.632
The representation of the
virtue of humility takes place

00:37:37.632 --> 00:37:39.610
through the language of art.
 

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:44.849
Dante approaches the cliff and
on the sides of the cliff he

00:37:44.849 --> 00:37:49.820
sees three sculptures embodying
examples of humility.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.947
The word pride,
which in Italian is--we have

00:37:52.947 --> 00:37:56.804
the English "superb,"
in Italian, we call it

00:37:56.804 --> 00:37:58.260
superbia.
 

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.925
To the word "superb,"
you add -ia,

00:38:00.925 --> 00:38:01.980
which is pride.
 

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.630
The word humility in Italian is
the same thing as

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.380
umiltà.
 

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.369
The word humility means--comes
from the ground,

00:38:10.369 --> 00:38:16.090
the sense of being down,
of being--the idea that one is

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:18.581
really with--
let's say--the feet on the

00:38:18.581 --> 00:38:18.860
ground.
 

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.905
The very opposite of
superbia which implies

00:38:21.905 --> 00:38:24.329
some kind of immoderate flight
away--

00:38:24.329 --> 00:38:27.650
a sense of the view of the
overman,

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.889
the idea of being a superman.
 

00:38:30.889 --> 00:38:36.056
It's the idea that someone who
wants to transcend the

00:38:36.056 --> 00:38:40.429
limitations of this world and
being human.

00:38:40.429 --> 00:38:45.005
The word for humility and the
word for human have the same

00:38:45.005 --> 00:38:49.179
etymology, in case you wonder
where it comes from.

00:38:49.179 --> 00:38:52.257
The homo,
which means 'man' in Latin,

00:38:52.257 --> 00:38:54.119
comes from homos.
 

00:38:54.119 --> 00:38:56.161
We are called man,
human beings,

00:38:56.161 --> 00:39:00.117
because we come from the earth
and we are close to the earth,

00:39:00.117 --> 00:39:02.159
and we return to the earth.
 

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:05.639
We come from the earth and
we're returning to the earth.

00:39:05.639 --> 00:39:09.940
The idea of humility is the
same notion.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:14.427
There is a kind of implicit
connection, etymologically,

00:39:14.427 --> 00:39:17.670
between the two words,
the two terms.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:22.250
One more remark to make,
this whole idea of having--

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:25.820
a couple of remarks before I go
on with the text that will serve

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.030
you for the rest of
Purgatory.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:35.199
The idea of having the virtues
and the vices,

00:39:35.199 --> 00:39:39.710
first one and then the other,
seem to cast Purgatorio,

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:44.960
but it's not really that way,
as a variant of a medieval

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.637
poetic form called
psychomachia which means

00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:53.360
"the battle of
thoughts."

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.498
By the way, this is a Latin
poem, one of the early Latin

00:39:58.498 --> 00:40:03.449
poems by this Latin Spanish poet
called Prudentius.

00:40:03.449 --> 00:40:05.545
It's a kind of
psychomachia,

00:40:05.545 --> 00:40:08.750
the battle of thoughts,
of contradictory thoughts.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:12.295
The second thing that I have to
say, is more important for the

00:40:12.295 --> 00:40:13.400
poetics of Dante.
 

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.217
Keep in mind that the whole
poetic mode of

00:40:16.217 --> 00:40:19.762
Purgatorio,
unlike the poetic mode of

00:40:19.762 --> 00:40:24.304
Inferno, is played out in
Purgatorio through the

00:40:24.304 --> 00:40:31.719
imagination,
art images, memories, phantasms.

00:40:31.719 --> 00:40:34.806
In other words,
we are really in a world which

00:40:34.806 --> 00:40:37.690
is in between that of bodies and
souls,

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.199
the world of the middle ground
of the imagination,

00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:41.639
and now we have the world of
art.

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:43.592
A world of art,
that Dante says,

00:40:43.592 --> 00:40:46.679
and I read from Canto X,
at the very beginning.

00:40:46.679 --> 00:40:52.065
I just want to give you this
as--it's an extraordinary--I

00:40:52.065 --> 00:40:58.123
don't want to go into excessive
detail, but I have to do it this

00:40:58.123 --> 00:40:58.989
time.
 

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:01.641
"When we were within the
threshold,"

00:41:01.641 --> 00:41:03.688
Canto X,
the very beginning,

00:41:03.688 --> 00:41:07.148
"of the gate which the
soul's perverse love

00:41:07.148 --> 00:41:08.400
disuses."
 

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:16.268
Purgatory is all a sequence of
variations on love.

00:41:16.268 --> 00:41:19.170
That's the moral law of
Purgatory.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.889
All sins in Purgatory are
sins--either we use the--

00:41:22.889 --> 00:41:26.969
we give love to the wrong
object, or we love too much in

00:41:26.969 --> 00:41:30.420
terms of what--
how we are being loved back or

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.880
we love too little.
 

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.590
These are the three general
subdivisions of Purgatory.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:40.786
That's "perverse love
disuses, making the crooked way

00:41:40.786 --> 00:41:43.878
seem straight,
by the resounding I heard it

00:41:43.878 --> 00:41:47.023
closed again;
and if I had turned my eyes to

00:41:47.023 --> 00:41:50.179
it what excuse would have served
the fault?"

00:41:50.179 --> 00:41:53.449
The reflection of what happened
before: "We were climbing

00:41:53.449 --> 00:41:56.505
through a cleft in the rock
which kept bending one way and

00:41:56.505 --> 00:41:58.490
the other,
it goes around the

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:01.510
mountain,"
that's really what the language

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:03.641
is,
"like a wave that comes

00:42:03.641 --> 00:42:05.902
and goes,
when my Leader began:

00:42:05.902 --> 00:42:10.554
'Here there is need to use some
skill in keeping close to this

00:42:10.554 --> 00:42:13.760
side or that where it turns
away."

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.820
The cliff is--there's an abyss
underneath it,

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:20.300
so it's an invitation to
prudence along the way.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:20.724
"..
 

00:42:20.724 --> 00:42:23.755
.and this made our steps so
scant that the waning moon had

00:42:23.755 --> 00:42:27.052
regained its bed to sink to rest
before we were forth from that

00:42:27.052 --> 00:42:28.010
needle's eye.
 

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:31.349
But when we were free and out
in the open above,

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:35.951
where the mountain draws back,
I weary and both uncertain of

00:42:35.951 --> 00:42:39.304
our way,"
we know now this has become a

00:42:39.304 --> 00:42:44.139
sort of formulaic expression of
the uncertainties of this exile

00:42:44.139 --> 00:42:48.525
as he moves up the mountain,
"we stopped on a level

00:42:48.525 --> 00:42:51.039
place more solitary than a
desert track.

00:42:51.039 --> 00:42:55.346
From its edge bordering on the
void to the foot of the lofty

00:42:55.346 --> 00:42:59.360
bank which rises sheer would
measure three times a man's

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.851
body,
and as far as my eye could make

00:43:01.851 --> 00:43:03.744
its flight,
now on the left hand,

00:43:03.744 --> 00:43:06.387
now on the right,
the terrace there seemed to me

00:43:06.387 --> 00:43:07.239
the same."
 

00:43:07.239 --> 00:43:10.469
What is all this about?
 

00:43:10.469 --> 00:43:16.021
What I want to point out is
that Dante is measuring the

00:43:16.021 --> 00:43:22.090
whole landscape in terms of the
measure of a human being.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:28.380
He's using the human beings--a
human being as the measure.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:31.500
Is man the measure?
 

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.849
You have heard that expression,
right?

00:43:33.849 --> 00:43:35.190
Are we the measure?
 

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.090
Are we the measure of what,
creation?

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:40.570
Are we the measure of what we
should do?

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:46.920
This is exactly the point of
the canto because pride means an

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:52.320
inordinate love and belief in
our own excellence.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.260
Pride means that we do not
think that we are--

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:01.380
we can be measured by others,
that we want to become the

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.190
measure for others,
or that we really do not belong

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:07.559
where others may think we
belong.

00:44:07.559 --> 00:44:08.530
That's what pride is.
 

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:10.170
It's a sin, very common.
 

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:12.440
Who do you think you are?
 

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.539
Who do--don't you know who I am?
 

00:44:14.539 --> 00:44:18.632
This is the language we use and
it's pride--I always like to say

00:44:18.632 --> 00:44:22.400
that we are never really proud
when we are dealing with our

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.179
janitor.
 

00:44:23.179 --> 00:44:26.849
They are not proud;
we've become so human, so good.

00:44:26.849 --> 00:44:31.092
We are always proud with those
who endanger our sense of our

00:44:31.092 --> 00:44:35.119
own measure, who seem to take
their own measure of us.

00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:38.755
Dante is starting with the idea
of measurement and I'll come

00:44:38.755 --> 00:44:42.389
back--this is the crucial
metaphor and I'll come to that.

00:44:42.389 --> 00:44:45.739
How do we measure what is human
and that is not human?

00:44:45.739 --> 00:44:49.724
One thing is clear:
that pride, superbia,

00:44:49.724 --> 00:44:54.050
means an inordinate love of
one's own excellence.

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:58.875
We are really far superior,
we think, than anybody else

00:44:58.875 --> 00:45:01.018
would have thought us.
 

00:45:01.018 --> 00:45:06.840
Then he goes on looking at
images made on the white marble,

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.800
"such that not only
Polycletus but nature would be

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.780
put to shame there."
 

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:18.518
Extraordinary metaphor already
talking about measure and about

00:45:18.518 --> 00:45:23.786
order, these are works of art
produced by the hand of God

00:45:23.786 --> 00:45:25.010
directly.
 

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:28.460
God is an artist and God has
made these images,

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:31.699
but it's such that nature,
which as you know,

00:45:31.699 --> 00:45:36.079
is the daughter of God and the
mother of the arts,

00:45:36.079 --> 00:45:39.309
and also an artist,
the famous Polycletus,

00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:42.219
a Greek scholar,
a Greek scholar Polycletus,

00:45:42.219 --> 00:45:43.429
would be put to shame.
 

00:45:43.429 --> 00:45:47.994
Already there is this sense of
rivalry within the pattern of

00:45:47.994 --> 00:45:49.619
generation of arts.
 

00:45:49.619 --> 00:45:54.110
That's the first thing,
and then the first image that

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:57.652
we see, is the image of the
angel Gabriel,

00:45:57.652 --> 00:46:02.230
the messenger who came to
earth, that's humility.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:05.369
He came to earth,
the descent of the high

00:46:05.369 --> 00:46:08.744
becoming low,
while the human beings who are

00:46:08.744 --> 00:46:12.590
low want to think of themselves
as very high.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:16.280
"The angel who came to
earth with a decree of the

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:20.251
many-years-wept-for peace that
opened heaven from its long

00:46:20.251 --> 00:46:24.639
interdict appeared before us so
truly graven there in a gracious

00:46:24.639 --> 00:46:28.610
attitude that it did not seem a
silent image."

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:30.521
That's God's art,
but very clear,

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:33.510
there's no difficulty in
understanding this art.

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:36.922
"One would have sworn,
he said: 'Ave,' the first words

00:46:36.922 --> 00:46:39.630
of the angel Gabriel doing the
Annunciation.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:42.795
The Annunciation is the story
of the humility,

00:46:42.795 --> 00:46:45.400
whereby obliquely,
God becomes man.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.418
So that's the descent,
another form of,

00:46:48.418 --> 00:46:52.710
not only the humility of Mary
in accepting the mandate,

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:55.650
but also the idea of the
descent.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:58.579
By the way, let me just point
out that this 'Ave' is

00:46:58.579 --> 00:47:00.550
what we call a
boustrophedon--

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:02.480
I have spelled the word out for
you--

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.440
for 'Eva.'
 

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.876
It's very conventional in
medieval literature:

00:47:07.876 --> 00:47:12.307
the idea that Mary becomes the
one who reverses the role of

00:47:12.307 --> 00:47:12.920
Eve.
 

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:16.885
With Eve there is the loss of
the Garden and the Fall,

00:47:16.885 --> 00:47:20.701
with Ave there is now
the turning of the key,

00:47:20.701 --> 00:47:23.320
as it were, and the Redemption.
 

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.596
"For she was imaged there
who turned the key to open the

00:47:26.596 --> 00:47:29.380
supreme love,
and in her bearing she had this

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.760
word imprinted--
this word imprinted:

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.824
'Ecce ancilla
Dei.'"

00:47:33.824 --> 00:47:38.128
She acknowledges her--
Mary acknowledges her ancillary

00:47:38.128 --> 00:47:38.639
role.
 

00:47:38.639 --> 00:47:42.809
She is a servant and she
acknowledges herself as a

00:47:42.809 --> 00:47:43.659
servant.
 

00:47:43.659 --> 00:47:48.456
Now, along side with this,
what we could call an ethical

00:47:48.456 --> 00:47:52.730
education, Dante has to learn
what humility is.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:56.878
There is an ethical education,
learn about what this humility

00:47:56.878 --> 00:47:57.639
is about.
 

00:47:57.639 --> 00:48:00.956
There is also an aesthetic
education going on,

00:48:00.956 --> 00:48:02.210
simultaneously.
 

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:04.389
After all, Dante's really
looking at art.

00:48:04.389 --> 00:48:07.724
The question is what is the
relationship between the virtue

00:48:07.724 --> 00:48:08.300
and art?
 

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.679
How can the two be together?
 

00:48:10.679 --> 00:48:14.048
To give you an idea of how
complicated the problem is,

00:48:14.048 --> 00:48:17.800
in the next canto Dante goes on
meeting all the painters.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.981
You read Canto XI,
Giotto and Cimabue,

00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:26.226
who are emblems of people who
invest their productions with an

00:48:26.226 --> 00:48:29.150
inordinate sense of its value.
 

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:34.210
Then Dante puts himself--puts
his friends Guido Cavalcanti--

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.960
you remember the two --
Guido's, Guido Guinizelli,

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.070
one Guido removed the other
Guido from its nest,

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:44.407
and now the third person has
come, meaning himself who

00:48:44.407 --> 00:48:46.550
probably will rout both of them.
 

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:47.768
What a proud statement.
 

00:48:47.768 --> 00:48:52.208
It is as if the artist is
always prone to this sort of

00:48:52.208 --> 00:48:57.400
inordinate idea of who they are
and what their value may be.

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:02.139
So art and humility and pride,
this is the issue.

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:04.510
The ethical education and the
aesthetic education.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.300
What is the aesthetic education?
 

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:10.425
Virgil is telling Dante how to
look, that's really the most

00:49:10.425 --> 00:49:11.849
complicated thing.
 

00:49:11.849 --> 00:49:14.693
For those of you who are doing
art history, that's really what

00:49:14.693 --> 00:49:15.300
it's about.
 

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.210
How do we look?
 

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.840
What do the eyes really reveal
to us?

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:21.500
"Do not keep thy mind only
on one part."

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:26.425
That's the looking--the belief
that we--or the temptation to

00:49:26.425 --> 00:49:31.434
lose sight of the totality of
things and not--and just taking

00:49:31.434 --> 00:49:33.690
one part for the whole.
 

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:36.914
"Do not keep thy mind only
on one part,' said the kind

00:49:36.914 --> 00:49:39.806
master who had me on that side
of him where the heart

00:49:39.806 --> 00:49:43.219
lies," on the left,
"so that I turned my face

00:49:43.219 --> 00:49:46.940
and saw beyond Mary on the same
side as he that prompted me,

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.349
another story set on the
rock."

00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:53.384
Dante has to learn how to look
and what he's looking at are

00:49:53.384 --> 00:49:54.079
stories.
 

00:49:54.079 --> 00:49:59.117
Story, the word is Greek,
for those of you who know some

00:49:59.117 --> 00:49:59.849
Greek.
 

00:49:59.849 --> 00:50:05.813
It comes from 'I saw and I
narrate,' and it's the same

00:50:05.813 --> 00:50:09.639
etymology for story and history.
 

00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:11.913
This is a little bit of
allegory of history,

00:50:11.913 --> 00:50:12.760
we are saying.
 

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.757
As if Dante's really
telling--begins with the New

00:50:14.757 --> 00:50:16.177
Testament,
the story of Mary,

00:50:16.177 --> 00:50:19.010
now we're going to see a
picture from the Old Testament,

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:22.750
David dancing in front of the
ark and then an episode of

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:25.514
Trajan,
the emperor who is an example

00:50:25.514 --> 00:50:26.449
of humility.
 

00:50:26.449 --> 00:50:27.530
You shall see him in a moment.
 

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:31.373
The point is that the whole of
history is an allegory of

00:50:31.373 --> 00:50:33.610
humility and that's God's art.
 

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:37.409
That's what Dante has God
represent for us.

00:50:37.409 --> 00:50:37.972
"...
 

00:50:37.972 --> 00:50:38.784
Mary..."
 

00:50:38.784 --> 00:50:39.534
etc."..
 

00:50:39.534 --> 00:50:42.974
.There, carved in the same
marble were the cart and oxen

00:50:42.974 --> 00:50:46.288
drawing the sacred ark on
account of which men fear an

00:50:46.288 --> 00:50:48.539
office not committed to them.
 

00:50:48.539 --> 00:50:51.371
In front people appeared and
the whole company,

00:50:51.371 --> 00:50:54.574
divided into seven choirs,
made two of my senses say,

00:50:54.574 --> 00:50:57.469
the one: 'No,' the other:
'Yes, they sing';

00:50:57.469 --> 00:51:01.208
in the same way at the smoke of
the incense that was imaged

00:51:01.208 --> 00:51:05.139
there, eyes and nose were in
contradiction with yes and no.

00:51:05.139 --> 00:51:08.014
There the humble
psalmist,"

00:51:08.014 --> 00:51:10.989
David,
"went before the blessed

00:51:10.989 --> 00:51:15.811
vessel girt up and dancing,
and that time he was both more

00:51:15.811 --> 00:51:21.094
and less than king;
opposite, figured at the window

00:51:21.094 --> 00:51:25.038
of a great palace,
Michal looked on,

00:51:25.038 --> 00:51:29.659
like a woman vexed and
scornful."

00:51:29.659 --> 00:51:33.300
This is really the story that
is told in Samuel,

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.702
in the Bible,
and Dante's really

00:51:35.702 --> 00:51:37.949
reinterpreting it for us.
 

00:51:37.949 --> 00:51:42.188
So I beg you to really pay a
little attention to some of

00:51:42.188 --> 00:51:43.500
these episodes.
 

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:46.179
First of all,
David is humbling himself.

00:51:46.179 --> 00:51:48.030
He's dancing.
 

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:54.811
He lifts up his ephod,
his dress, and starts dancing

00:51:54.811 --> 00:51:56.539
out of joy.
 

00:51:56.539 --> 00:52:01.780
It's an episode that is used as
one of the many cases of

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:06.070
so-called ludic theology,
playful theology.

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:10.829
Its intrusion is that--in the
plan of salvation there is

00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:15.503
always the presence of this
comedy, this comic idea and

00:52:15.503 --> 00:52:17.579
David embodies that.
 

00:52:17.579 --> 00:52:22.998
Then there's this little phrase
which we--you must have noticed

00:52:22.998 --> 00:52:26.320
that appears so often in this
canto.

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:31.324
More often in this canto than
ever before in the whole poem,

00:52:31.324 --> 00:52:33.699
"more and less."
 

00:52:33.699 --> 00:52:38.503
It is as if it's impossible to
use or find in a canto where

00:52:38.503 --> 00:52:42.478
measure is the issue,
the position about where we

00:52:42.478 --> 00:52:46.039
are, who we are,
and what we are doing.

00:52:46.039 --> 00:52:48.932
One thing is clear;
that opposite to David,

00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:52.239
there is his wife,
Michal, sitting at the window,

00:52:52.239 --> 00:52:54.170
a different perspective.
 

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:55.860
What she sees,
this is art,

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:59.110
this is a question of
perspective what she sees.

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:03.489
She is so angry at David
because he, by his action of

00:53:03.489 --> 00:53:08.039
dancing in front of the ark,
is humiliating himself.

00:53:08.039 --> 00:53:11.440
He's losing his state as king.
 

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.780
He's losing his stature as king.
 

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:18.367
The fact is that for Dante,
Michal is completely missing

00:53:18.367 --> 00:53:19.369
the point.
 

00:53:19.369 --> 00:53:23.050
It is a stance of someone who
thinks that she's superior,

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:25.139
a stance of someone who's
sitting at the great--

00:53:25.139 --> 00:53:28.465
at the window of her great
palace, who will not have

00:53:28.465 --> 00:53:31.010
anything to do with what's below
her.

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:35.117
We are entering the world of
the--the domain of what pride

00:53:35.117 --> 00:53:39.512
may be, what's wrong with pride,
and why pride may really be a

00:53:39.512 --> 00:53:40.090
sin.
 

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:44.431
Pride may not be a sin because
we want to reach higher than we

00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:44.860
are.
 

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.840
That's probably okay.
 

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:53.713
What makes pride a sin is that
we tend to have contempt for

00:53:53.713 --> 00:53:56.550
what we think is below us.
 

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:59.800
That's really the displacement;
it blinds us.

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.978
So--I'm introducing here,
since this is a world of art,

00:54:03.978 --> 00:54:06.300
the notion of a perspective.
 

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.050
We've been talking about
perspective.

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:14.440
Pride is tied to perspective,
because it sets--

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.820
by being proud I think that I
have,

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.889
within myself,
I certainly have a view of

00:54:20.889 --> 00:54:24.880
myself that may be at odds with
the reality of me.

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:30.114
Certainly, this is the case of,
not David, but it's the case of

00:54:30.114 --> 00:54:31.719
Michal, his wife.
 

00:54:31.719 --> 00:54:34.773
The third episode is,
I think even more interesting,

00:54:34.773 --> 00:54:37.409
and then we'll see what's going
to happen.

00:54:37.409 --> 00:54:42.143
"I moved my feet from
where I was to examine close at

00:54:42.143 --> 00:54:46.630
hand another part of this,"
how do you examine?

00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:48.650
What is an aesthetic education?
 

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:51.550
How do you look at the images
at hand?

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:56.199
"another story which I saw
gleaming white beyond Michal.

00:54:56.199 --> 00:54:58.940
Depicted there,"
now the third episode is from

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:00.750
secular history,
Roman history.

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:03.250
So you have the Old Testament,
the New Testament,

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:06.568
the Roman secular history,
"there was the glorious

00:55:06.568 --> 00:55:10.380
deed of the Roman Prince whose
worth moved Gregory to his great

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:12.699
victory--
I mean the emperor Trajan;

00:55:12.699 --> 00:55:16.914
and a poor widow was at his
bridle in a posture of grief and

00:55:16.914 --> 00:55:17.699
in tears.
 

00:55:17.699 --> 00:55:20.989
The place about him seemed
trampled and thronged with

00:55:20.989 --> 00:55:24.847
knights and the eagles on the
gold above them moved visibly in

00:55:24.847 --> 00:55:25.670
the wind.
 

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:28.853
The poor woman among all these
seemed to say:

00:55:28.853 --> 00:55:32.686
'Lord avenge me for my son that
is dead, for whom I am

00:55:32.686 --> 00:55:35.108
stricken';
and he to answer her:

00:55:35.108 --> 00:55:38.596
'Wait now till I return,"
he's going to Romania,

00:55:38.596 --> 00:55:39.199
Dacia.
 

00:55:39.199 --> 00:55:43.128
If you see the column of Trajan
in Rome, it's still the

00:55:43.128 --> 00:55:46.039
monument--document of that
expedition.

00:55:46.039 --> 00:55:46.474
"..
 

00:55:46.474 --> 00:55:49.239
.wait now till I return';
and she: 'My Lord,' like one

00:55:49.239 --> 00:55:51.460
whose grief is urgent,
'if thou return not?';

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:55.380
and he: 'He that is in my place
will do it for thee';

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.422
and she: 'What shall another's
goodness avail thee if thou art

00:55:58.422 --> 00:55:59.869
forgetful of thine own?'...
 

00:55:59.869 --> 00:56:02.929
'Now take comfort for I must
fulfill my duty before I go;

00:56:02.929 --> 00:56:06.730
justice requires it and
compassion bids me stay."

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:10.688
It's the story of Trajan who
gets off his high horse,

00:56:10.688 --> 00:56:13.050
levels with the little widow.
 

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:15.139
The diminutives are Dante.
 

00:56:15.139 --> 00:56:17.719
The language is of humility,
the little widow,

00:56:17.719 --> 00:56:23.119
and administers and gives her
justice,

00:56:23.119 --> 00:56:26.523
because for Dante,
the perfect emperor in Trajan

00:56:26.523 --> 00:56:29.710
certainly is the perfect emperor
must be--

00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:34.083
must have the attributes of
mercy and justice and he gives

00:56:34.083 --> 00:56:37.766
evidence of that:
"if for whose sight,"

00:56:37.766 --> 00:56:38.380
etc.
 

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:46.369
Now that's the drama that now
develops.

00:56:46.369 --> 00:56:49.860
Dante's seen all this,
he has understood these images

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:52.480
and the meaning of these images
and--

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.271
I'm just going to tell you
about this little drama and we

00:56:57.271 --> 00:56:58.300
stop here.
 

00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.494
"While I was taking
delight,"

00:57:01.494 --> 00:57:04.099
no problem in taking delight.
 

00:57:04.099 --> 00:57:09.025
After all, this is God's art,
so having delight in itself is

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:12.784
part of the appreciation of this
art--"..

00:57:12.784 --> 00:57:16.125
.the images of so great
humilities,"

00:57:16.125 --> 00:57:20.050
I think that the oxymoron is
deliberate,

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:22.557
"so great humilities,
dear to sight,

00:57:22.557 --> 00:57:26.340
too, for their Craftsman's
sake," I love them because

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:28.000
they were made by God.
 

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.224
Virgil prompts him,
"See on this side many

00:57:31.224 --> 00:57:35.219
people, the poet murmured,
'but coming with slow steps;

00:57:35.219 --> 00:57:37.320
they will direct us to the
other stairs."

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:41.250
Now here is Dante's drama:
"my eyes,

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:45.449
which were looking intently,
were not slow in turning to him

00:57:45.449 --> 00:57:47.940
being eager for new
sights."

00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:50.429
He yields to the temptations of
the eye.

00:57:50.429 --> 00:57:52.710
Have you ever heard about the
three temptations?

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:57.681
The pride of life,
the pride of the eyes and the

00:57:57.681 --> 00:58:03.713
curiosity and the pride of the
heart, but I would--and the

00:58:03.713 --> 00:58:07.840
three temptations are present
here.

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:08.940
"But I would not have
thee,

00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:12.257
reader,"
Dante's turning to us in an

00:58:12.257 --> 00:58:14.840
apostrophe,
as he has done before,

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:18.197
"fall away from good
resolve for hearing how God

00:58:18.197 --> 00:58:23.000
wills that the debt be paid;
do not dwell on the form."

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.617
He's telling us not to care
about the images as such

00:58:25.617 --> 00:58:28.097
"of the torment,
think of what follows,

00:58:28.097 --> 00:58:30.820
think that at worst it cannot
go beyond the great

00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:31.900
Judgement."
 

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.599
He sort of is making a
preemptive strike.

00:58:34.599 --> 00:58:37.639
Don't worry about the peculiar
form of the art,

00:58:37.639 --> 00:58:41.275
look at the meaning of the
art--and he can't--but that's

00:58:41.275 --> 00:58:43.059
what he wants us to do.
 

00:58:43.059 --> 00:58:46.376
He says--look at what he says
to Virgil: "Master,' I

00:58:46.376 --> 00:58:49.882
began,
'that which I see coming to us

00:58:49.882 --> 00:58:55.730
does not seem to me persons and
I know not what they are,

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:58.518
so confused is my sight."
 

00:58:58.518 --> 00:59:04.884
What an incredible contrast
between what Dante had seen with

00:59:04.884 --> 00:59:07.965
God's images,
all clear to him,

00:59:07.965 --> 00:59:12.514
but now that he's seeing some
human beings who are doubled

00:59:12.514 --> 00:59:16.248
under massive boulders--
because that's the punishment

00:59:16.248 --> 00:59:19.112
inflicted on the proud,
to put them and press them

00:59:19.112 --> 00:59:23.289
against the earth--
he does not recognize them.

00:59:23.289 --> 00:59:29.010
It is as if his aesthetic
education has been for nothing.

00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:32.389
It is as if ethical education
has been for nothing.

00:59:32.389 --> 00:59:36.056
He had no difficulty in
deciphering God's art,

00:59:36.056 --> 00:59:40.782
which is so clear and luminous,
but now he does not want to

00:59:40.782 --> 00:59:43.309
identify with what he sees.
 

00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:46.690
He resembles Michal,
who from high up,

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:51.260
does not want to have anything
to do with David.

00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:57.010
This is the--exactly the same
problem that Dante is facing.

00:59:57.010 --> 00:59:59.550
He has--he had no problem with
Gabriel,

00:59:59.550 --> 01:00:03.949
the descent of Gabriel,
he had no problem with Trajan,

01:00:03.949 --> 01:00:08.652
but he himself is unwilling to
identify with those that he

01:00:08.652 --> 01:00:10.880
believes are beneath him.
 

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.280
Then he goes on.
 

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.480
Virgil explains,
"The grievous nature of

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.679
their torment doubles them to
the ground,

01:00:17.679 --> 01:00:20.440
so that my eyes at first were
in debate about them,

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.610
but," he says,
they are really human beings

01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:23.119
like you.
 

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:28.327
Dante goes into a further
apostrophe to all Christians

01:00:28.327 --> 01:00:34.518
calling himself superbi,
in Italian, cristiani.

01:00:34.518 --> 01:00:36.654
The Italian line is actually
very interesting for a reason

01:00:36.654 --> 01:00:37.889
that I'll tell you in a moment.
 

01:00:37.889 --> 01:00:41.690
Look at line 121,
O superbi cristiani,

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:43.780
miseri lassi. ..
 

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:47.380
There is an incredible contrast
between the word superbi,

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:50.693
meaning superior,
right, a claim of superiority

01:00:50.693 --> 01:00:53.862
and the word lassi which
means lapsed,

01:00:53.862 --> 01:00:55.159
having fallen.
 

01:00:55.159 --> 01:00:57.909
So within the same line you
capture the two--

01:00:57.909 --> 01:01:01.610
this dynamic of how we want to
be up and how we're going to--

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:05.208
the more--the higher up we want
to go the quicker we seem to be

01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:05.789
falling.
 

01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:09.710
"Weary wretches,"
mistranslation,

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:12.164
"who are sick in the
mind's vision and put your trust

01:01:12.164 --> 01:01:15.130
in backward steps,
do you not perceive that we are

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:18.320
worms born to form the angelic
butterfly."

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:24.197
I want to stress this shift in
pronouns, 'do you not perceive,'

01:01:24.197 --> 01:01:28.559
Dante is literally taking the
higher ground.

01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:31.139
We do not know, he knows, right?
 

01:01:31.139 --> 01:01:34.889
Do you--he's preaching to us,
''do you not perceive?'

01:01:34.889 --> 01:01:41.170
But then he--with a subsequent
pronoun that we are worms,

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:47.143
he literally erases the
distance between himself and the

01:01:47.143 --> 01:01:49.548
readers,
between himself and the other

01:01:49.548 --> 01:01:50.050
Christians.
 

01:01:50.050 --> 01:01:53.860
He places himself on the same
ground where we are.

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.320
That's the quality of the
double voice of Dante,

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.179
systematically punctuating this
text,

01:02:00.179 --> 01:02:03.550
as claim of a transcendent
superior perspective,

01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:06.530
because after all,
he really has seen the whole--

01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:10.389
the unfolding of God's cosmos.
 

01:02:10.389 --> 01:02:14.121
He really has witnessed it,
but at the same time,

01:02:14.121 --> 01:02:17.619
he descends and is part of a
common plight.

01:02:17.619 --> 01:02:20.434
That's really what the line is,
"Do you not perceive that

01:02:20.434 --> 01:02:23.018
we are worms born to form the
angelic butterfly?"

01:02:23.018 --> 01:02:25.940
It's an allusion that the word
for butterfly,

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:31.909
not in Italian,
but in the Roman sarcophagi,

01:02:31.909 --> 01:02:35.190
in antiquity,
whether they are in

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.577
Aix-en-Provence,
if you happen to go there,

01:02:38.577 --> 01:02:42.059
or you go to Fiesole,
where there was a Roman

01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:47.632
cemetery, you would always see a
butterfly imprinted on the

01:02:47.632 --> 01:02:53.590
sarcophagus because the Greek
word for butterfly is psyche.

01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:57.489
It's the same word for the soul
and the butterfly,

01:02:57.489 --> 01:03:01.559
and by putting the emblem of
the butterfly that indicated at

01:03:01.559 --> 01:03:05.903
death the soul finally would be
capable of flying off toward the

01:03:05.903 --> 01:03:08.179
light and toward the creator.
 

01:03:08.179 --> 01:03:12.811
So Dante's clearly using and
remembering this kind of motif

01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:14.329
that he has seen.
 

01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:16.219
"That soars to judgement
without defense?

01:03:16.219 --> 01:03:18.978
Why does your mind float so
high, since you are ..

01:03:18.978 --> 01:03:21.231
.imperfect insects,
like the worm that is

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:22.469
undeveloped."
 

01:03:22.469 --> 01:03:23.699
The language of a metamorphosis.
 

01:03:23.699 --> 01:03:28.170
We are in the process of making
ourselves both alive and in the

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:30.550
penitential world of Purgatory.
 

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:34.614
And then how he ends with a
kind of iconographic motif that

01:03:34.614 --> 01:03:38.327
recapitulates the whole
iconographic element that make

01:03:38.327 --> 01:03:41.027
up the poem,
Canto X, "As,

01:03:41.027 --> 01:03:44.380
for corbel to support ceiling
or roof,

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:47.679
a figure is sometimes seen
joining the knees to the breast,

01:03:47.679 --> 01:03:51.248
which begets from its unreality
real distress in him that sees

01:03:51.248 --> 01:03:53.043
it,
in such a posture I saw these

01:03:53.043 --> 01:03:54.289
when I looked carefully.
 

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:59.264
They were indeed bent down more
and less as they had more and

01:03:59.264 --> 01:04:02.940
less on their back,
and he that had most patience

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.922
in looks seemed,
by his weeping,

01:04:04.922 --> 01:04:06.590
to say: 'I can no more."
 

01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:07.940
What is this about?
 

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.099
What is this story about?
 

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:12.679
Well, the story is first of all
about this passage.

01:04:12.679 --> 01:04:16.601
It's about the fact that Dante
has just warned us not to pay

01:04:16.601 --> 01:04:20.190
attention to the form and to
look at the meaning of the

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.719
particular message.
 

01:04:21.719 --> 01:04:25.059
Now he returns to us and
focuses on the form.

01:04:25.059 --> 01:04:27.929
What he's describing are the
so-called Caryatides,

01:04:27.929 --> 01:04:30.188
human forms,
that if you go--maybe in New

01:04:30.188 --> 01:04:33.447
York you may see them,
but certainly in European

01:04:33.447 --> 01:04:37.809
cities these human forms seem to
be buttressing edifices and

01:04:37.809 --> 01:04:40.619
buildings and they are
decorative,

01:04:40.619 --> 01:04:43.849
but Dante is saying,
the form matters.

01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:48.150
We cannot really go to the
ultimate meaning by bypassing

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:49.010
the form.
 

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:53.054
He's literally,
by picking up the sculptural

01:04:53.054 --> 01:04:57.289
motif of the canto,
returning to this idea.

01:04:57.289 --> 01:05:01.755
We shall see as I have to leave
you hanging on this problem of

01:05:01.755 --> 01:05:02.780
perspective.
 

01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:06.914
Next time, we'll read XI and
XII and continue,

01:05:06.914 --> 01:05:12.335
and therefore the meaning of
art, how art can change a moral

01:05:12.335 --> 01:05:14.909
perception of the world.
 

01:05:14.909 --> 01:05:18.454
That's the idea in which you
are all wondering--have been

01:05:18.454 --> 01:05:20.480
wondering with your questions.
 

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.260
What is Dante's understanding
of art?

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:26.150
It's so dangerous and it can
be, of course,

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:30.206
but there is a role that art
can play in altering our

01:05:30.206 --> 01:05:32.934
perception,
our moral perception,

01:05:32.934 --> 01:05:37.603
in an effect form becomes a way
to go to understand the moral

01:05:37.603 --> 01:05:40.871
world and the moral terms in
which you are.

01:05:40.871 --> 01:05:43.440
We shall see this next time.
 

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.769
Let's see if there are
questions now?

01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:13.190
The real--I think we are
approaching the heart of the

01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:15.280
matter in Purgatory.
 

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:20.690
The relationship between ethics
and aesthetics and what I really

01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:24.905
pointed out so far,
then is this idea that Dante is

01:06:24.905 --> 01:06:29.260
trying to find out what is the
measure for human beings,

01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.119
because you cannot say well,
it's pride.

01:06:31.119 --> 01:06:33.489
What criteria?
 

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:39.436
If I want to reach for what is
so far away from me,

01:06:39.436 --> 01:06:44.909
why should that be viewed as a
sin of pride?

01:06:44.909 --> 01:06:48.929
What are the criteria?
 

01:06:48.929 --> 01:06:52.373
What is the context in which we
can really talk of pride and why

01:06:52.373 --> 01:06:53.739
is humility any better?
 

01:06:53.739 --> 01:06:57.239
We haven't touched any of this
yet.

01:06:57.239 --> 01:07:00.940
One thing that is clear is that
Dante is,

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:05.108
for now, on the one hand,
giving examples of art and

01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:07.215
humility,
making mistakes,

01:07:07.215 --> 01:07:09.539
the confusion of his
perception.

01:07:09.539 --> 01:07:12.311
He says that he cannot quite
figure out what are these shapes

01:07:12.311 --> 01:07:12.911
that he sees.
 

01:07:12.911 --> 01:07:14.389
There's something disfigured.
 

01:07:14.389 --> 01:07:18.262
He cannot quite identify with,
he cannot recognize them and

01:07:18.262 --> 01:07:21.601
then claims that we really
should be looking at the

01:07:21.601 --> 01:07:24.456
meaning,
at the ultimate meaning of

01:07:24.456 --> 01:07:29.039
things, but then he returns and
valorizes the idea of form.

01:07:29.039 --> 01:07:34.739
We cannot bypass form in art or
in experience.

01:07:34.739 --> 01:07:38.902
We cannot skip the idea of
time, that's really what

01:07:38.902 --> 01:07:41.400
existentially it amounts to.
 

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.739
That's all I really have said.
 

01:07:42.739 --> 01:07:45.362
Then, maybe,
I explained to you a few

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:49.150
etymological connections:
humility and the human,

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:53.458
the meaning of history,
and introduce this principle of

01:07:53.458 --> 01:07:57.610
perspective that I have been
talking about before.

01:07:57.610 --> 01:08:01.159
This is really connected with
the representation of art.

01:08:01.159 --> 01:08:03.891
Perspective,
what is the--what kind of

01:08:03.891 --> 01:08:06.550
perspective does art then give
us?

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:09.900
We all know that in art,
we use perspective,

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:12.360
especially the modern language
of art,

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:15.079
the modern language of
painting, ever since the

01:08:15.079 --> 01:08:18.212
fifteenth century explicitly
discusses the question of

01:08:18.212 --> 01:08:19.158
perspective.
 

01:08:19.158 --> 01:08:23.837
I see the world according to
the position that I occupy in

01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:26.653
it,
and the position that occupy in

01:08:26.653 --> 01:08:31.000
it reveals things to me which
are unique and irreducible.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.725
At the same time it implies--it
also implies--but this is not

01:08:34.725 --> 01:08:37.828
the case, the possibility of
manipulating space.

01:08:37.828 --> 01:08:41.658
The fifteenth-century
Renaissance discovers that space

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:45.850
is not unalterable and fixed,
but it can be manipulated.

01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:49.622
We're dealing with--up to that
point, maybe we're dealing with

01:08:49.622 --> 01:08:51.850
time and the manipulation of
time.

01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:54.442
You don't have to watch a
football game to know what I

01:08:54.442 --> 01:08:57.377
mean about the manipulation of
time, but then there is such a

01:08:57.377 --> 01:08:59.090
thing as manipulation of space.
 

01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:00.578
I can create the space.
 

01:09:00.578 --> 01:09:04.100
I can make of a small space
something appear large.

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:07.270
Space is not a fixed entity.
 

01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:11.122
That's what perspective comes
to mean in the fifteenth

01:09:11.122 --> 01:09:11.850
century.
 

01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:17.109
For Dante, perspective is
connected to an inner world.

01:09:17.109 --> 01:09:19.470
What is my perspective of
myself?

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:22.939
What is my sense of the measure
of things?

01:09:22.939 --> 01:09:25.090
How do I view the world?
 

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:29.286
Michal gives one answer,
and she can be angry about what

01:09:29.286 --> 01:09:33.560
David does, misunderstanding the
whole point of David.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.948
What does she misunderstand
about David?

01:09:35.948 --> 01:09:39.420
That in humiliating himself,
he had really found himself

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:42.260
higher by the idea of
humiliation of self,

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:45.601
which is exactly that of Mary,
and which is exactly that of

01:09:45.601 --> 01:09:46.868
the story of Trajan.
 

01:09:46.868 --> 01:09:51.981
How do you--Michal does not
understand the reversibility of

01:09:51.981 --> 01:09:53.038
positions.
 

01:09:53.038 --> 01:09:56.578
That's really the argument,
so far and I think that Dante

01:09:56.578 --> 01:10:00.306
is making a big deal with pride
because pride is seen as the

01:10:00.306 --> 01:10:02.845
root,
the spiritual root,

01:10:02.845 --> 01:10:04.250
of all evils.
 

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:08.809
Let me see if there are some
questions that I can--we have a

01:10:08.809 --> 01:10:10.510
few minutes--please.
 

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.810
Student:
Why does Dante have trouble

01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:15.494
sympathizing with the sinners in
Purgatory,

01:10:15.494 --> 01:10:18.836
or other people when he doesn't
have trouble doing the same in

01:10:18.836 --> 01:10:19.658
Inferno?
 

01:10:19.658 --> 01:10:22.671
Prof: In Inferno,
why does Dante's trouble

01:10:22.671 --> 01:10:25.520
sympathizing with the sinners in
Purgatory?

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.806
Especially here,
because in Inferno,

01:10:27.806 --> 01:10:30.029
he even kicks some of the
heads.

01:10:30.029 --> 01:10:33.525
You can't--I mean he has
sympathy, but when it's

01:10:33.525 --> 01:10:36.130
necessary he just--he has had
it.

01:10:36.130 --> 01:10:42.380
And in Canto XXXII,
the guy was frozen and stuck in

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:45.380
ice, it wasn't pretty.
 

01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:50.384
But here it's true,
especially now he has--he

01:10:50.384 --> 01:10:53.908
declares this--his confusion.
 

01:10:53.908 --> 01:10:58.145
It may be because I couldn't--I
did not know what these forms

01:10:58.145 --> 01:10:58.569
are.
 

01:10:58.569 --> 01:11:02.795
I think they have to do with
the whole question of what did

01:11:02.795 --> 01:11:04.832
he learn,
first of all,

01:11:04.832 --> 01:11:10.113
from the images that he saw
because you know Virgil had just

01:11:10.113 --> 01:11:12.439
taught him how to look.
 

01:11:12.439 --> 01:11:15.170
Look here;
you move around;

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:18.412
don't stay in one place;
you can look underneath,

01:11:18.412 --> 01:11:19.738
so that's one problem.
 

01:11:19.738 --> 01:11:23.189
What is a moral and an
aesthetic education?

01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:28.189
Then he's just also,
I think, indicating the whole

01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:33.698
idea what--is it ever possible
to look at the world?

01:11:33.698 --> 01:11:38.729
More of this next time,
as disengaged spectators.

01:11:38.729 --> 01:11:43.002
Think of ourselves in the
theatre, which is an image that

01:11:43.002 --> 01:11:45.979
I probably will bring in and
discuss.

01:11:45.979 --> 01:11:50.920
You go to the theatre and you
really--

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.876
sometimes we all feel that we
should jump on the stage and

01:11:55.876 --> 01:11:59.788
rescue the damsel in distress or
whatever,

01:11:59.788 --> 01:12:02.489
and yet, you may see someone
who can do that,

01:12:02.489 --> 01:12:04.390
but many of us won't.
 

01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:09.328
We want to be unaffected by it,
that's what Dante's doing.

01:12:09.328 --> 01:12:14.761
He would like to be--to feel
that he is no longer like any of

01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:16.210
these sinners.
 

01:12:16.210 --> 01:12:18.529
That's the mistake he's making.
 

01:12:18.529 --> 01:12:23.850
It's really that he's--it's an
indifference coming to him from

01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:26.814
something akin,
though not exactly,

01:12:26.814 --> 01:12:30.130
to Michal's sure sense of
herself.

01:12:30.130 --> 01:12:32.449
I have nothing to do with the
mob here.

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:34.788
What is this? This is the king?
 

01:12:34.788 --> 01:12:36.609
I don't want to even be his
wife.

01:12:36.609 --> 01:12:41.640
That's what Dante's doing in
that scene.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:47.564
I do not want to be with this
kind of disfigured lowly forms

01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:48.569
of life.
 

01:12:48.569 --> 01:12:51.203
I am better,
I have seen God's art,

01:12:51.203 --> 01:12:54.069
and I have learned about God's
art.

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:58.670
Do you see the moral and
spiritual confusion that this

01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:02.489
kind of drama is going to
generate in him?

01:13:02.489 --> 01:13:03.500
That's the answer.
 

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.300
The one who reflects
beautifully on this,

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:10.430
I will bring the passage in,
but I would like you to read it

01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:11.479
if you can.
 

01:13:11.479 --> 01:13:13.952
Book II of the
Confessions of St.

01:13:13.952 --> 01:13:15.346
Augustine, because St.
 

01:13:15.346 --> 01:13:18.898
Augustine loves to go every--he
doesn't like to go to the

01:13:18.898 --> 01:13:22.511
spectacles at the Colosseum
because they are so vulgar and

01:13:22.511 --> 01:13:25.529
beneath him,
but he loves to go to the

01:13:25.529 --> 01:13:28.890
theatre and he has an
extraordinary reflection.

01:13:28.890 --> 01:13:32.859
What does it mean to be
unaffected in the theatre?

01:13:32.859 --> 01:13:37.470
How do I have to understand my
discomfort at the theatre?

01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:41.229
It's the very image Dante uses
at the end of Canto X.

01:13:41.229 --> 01:13:43.963
You remember when he says that
we see Caryatides,

01:13:43.963 --> 01:13:46.983
which we know are phony,
and yet they can inspire some

01:13:46.983 --> 01:13:48.180
kind of distress.
 

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:51.020
I'm paraphrasing very poorly
the last paragraph,

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.788
the last lines of
Purgatorio X,

01:13:53.788 --> 01:13:59.119
"Is it possible to ever be
indifferent spectators of the

01:13:59.119 --> 01:14:01.430
turmoil around us?"
 

01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:05.293
What's at stake when I say,
well these things don't touch

01:14:05.293 --> 01:14:08.743
me, have nothing to do with me,
and Dante's saying,

01:14:08.743 --> 01:14:10.470
they always touch us.
 

01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:14.445
It takes time for him to
understand it and I think that

01:14:14.445 --> 01:14:16.140
he is unveiling that.
 

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:21.729
He's showing it to us in Canto
X.

01:14:21.729 --> 01:14:22.890
Please.
 

01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:25.310
Student:
You seem to draw a connection

01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:27.126
between form and time
sometimes...

01:14:27.126 --> 01:14:30.262
Prof: I think that we
can draw a connection between

01:14:30.262 --> 01:14:31.747
form and time,
and continue,

01:14:31.747 --> 01:14:34.279
you want to make a reflection
on that?

01:14:34.279 --> 01:14:36.751
Student:
Then also if there is some way

01:14:36.751 --> 01:14:39.277
to draw in the notion of
futurity as time at...

01:14:39.277 --> 01:14:40.979
Prof: The notion of?
 

01:14:40.979 --> 01:14:44.408
Student:
Futurity or--as time necessary

01:14:44.408 --> 01:14:45.704
at the beginning.
 

01:14:45.704 --> 01:14:47.229
Prof: Yes.
 

01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:50.323
Student:I'm kind of
struggling with the idea of an

01:14:50.323 --> 01:14:53.860
art form which is sort of like a
fixed immutable thing and I have

01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:54.413
no idea...
 

01:14:54.413 --> 01:14:56.680
Prof: The question is
since--

01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.851
I think that was implied,
if I didn't say it in what I

01:14:59.851 --> 01:15:02.530
was saying,
that there is a connection

01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:04.158
between form and time.
 

01:15:04.158 --> 01:15:09.391
The struggle--the question then
becomes we are usually--think of

01:15:09.391 --> 01:15:14.042
form as something which is
fixed, how can that be part of

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:15.868
the world of time?
 

01:15:15.868 --> 01:15:18.170
Well, in a number of ways,
I would say.

01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:21.479
That the form--Dante is saying
first of all,

01:15:21.479 --> 01:15:26.149
witnessing or watching history,
therefore it has a kind of

01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:31.229
unfolding and he discusses art
in terms of a metamorphosis,

01:15:31.229 --> 01:15:35.689
an ongoing process of change
that includes the idea of time.

01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:39.024
One way in which Giotto really
differs from shades from what

01:15:39.024 --> 01:15:42.497
we're going to see next canto--
it's not an arbitrary relation

01:15:42.497 --> 01:15:46.052
here that I'm making--
distinguishes himself from

01:15:46.052 --> 01:15:50.609
Byzantine mosaics is that he
introduces a history.

01:15:50.609 --> 01:15:54.239
Painting is a series of
elements and you got to keep

01:15:54.239 --> 01:15:56.020
looking at all of them.
 

01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:02.484
So it's a form for all--it's
unalterable quality the form

01:16:02.484 --> 01:16:04.606
indicates;
forms change,

01:16:04.606 --> 01:16:06.988
there's a history of forms to
begin with.

01:16:06.988 --> 01:16:13.186
I could become generalized in
my answer--Dante understands it

01:16:13.186 --> 01:16:17.010
in a way as a metamorphic
sequence.

01:16:17.010 --> 01:16:20.189
From that point of view form
sense of all time,

01:16:20.189 --> 01:16:22.770
in fact, Dante says whenever
you see a particular scene,

01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:25.609
avoid what you are seeing and
see that what it means,

01:16:25.609 --> 01:16:29.350
now that is the occlusion of
time.

01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:31.380
That is an eclipsing of time.
 

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:34.779
Let me just go to the ideal
lesson, the ideal poem,

01:16:34.779 --> 01:16:37.500
it's like when you are reading
a poem.

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:40.117
You're reading a poem,
of course the form is

01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:42.198
unchanging,
but unless you know the

01:16:42.198 --> 01:16:45.137
beginning, and you start from
the beginning and you read

01:16:45.137 --> 01:16:47.127
through,
i.e., time, you,

01:16:47.127 --> 01:16:50.347
come to the end;
you miss the point about the

01:16:50.347 --> 01:16:51.114
poem, right?
 

01:16:51.114 --> 01:16:52.010
I mean I do.
 

01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:56.239
You got to read--you got to be
in time and the novel,

01:16:56.239 --> 01:16:59.170
you got to read Proust,
forget it.

01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:02.710
Pulci, which I'm reading now,
that takes forever.

01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:04.510
So thank you;
we'll see you next time.

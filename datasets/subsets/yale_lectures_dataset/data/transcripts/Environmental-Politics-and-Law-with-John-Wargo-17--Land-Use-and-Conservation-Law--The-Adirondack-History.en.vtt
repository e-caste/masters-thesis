00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:02.340
Prof: Okay everyone.
 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.620
First, thank you for coming out
on such a blustery day.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.663
If you have not picked up your
exam from your teaching fellow,

00:00:10.663 --> 00:00:13.640
you can do that after class
today.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.780
And we're switching gears.
 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.828
We're moving from questions
about how to manage chemicals in

00:00:19.828 --> 00:00:23.053
the environment to questions
about how to affect

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:24.220
conservation.
 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.398
And also especially how to
allocate and manage land use and

00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:32.360
various natural resources
associated with landscapes.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.160
And today I'm going to use an
example,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.876
a history of a conservation
effort in New York State known

00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:45.006
as the Adirondack Park that has
a conservation history that now

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:47.240
spans almost 130 years.
 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.470
One of the oldest parks in the
nation,

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.893
and it contains many terrific
examples of a variety of

00:00:53.893 --> 00:00:57.768
different strategies to conserve
resources and to protect the

00:00:57.768 --> 00:00:58.350
land.
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.960
Now, no matter where you are in
the world,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.286
and if you're interested in
managing land use and managing

00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:09.170
ecosystems or biological
resources,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.620
there are a variety of
questions that I'd encourage you

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.030
to ask.
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.409
One is first to become familiar
with property rights.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.090
How are they defined?
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.830
Who has rights to which types
of resources?

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.858
And in this case,
it'll become clear that it's

00:01:24.858 --> 00:01:29.165
important for you to think about
property not as a thing but as a

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:31.319
set of social relationships.
 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.718
Property is often defined in
law as a bundle,

00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:36.340
a bundle of rights.
 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.260
But if I have a right that's
defined and protected by law,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.530
then others have an obligation.
 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.849
So you can't really think about
rights in the absence of

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.720
consideration of obligations.
 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.690
And if you violate your
obligation,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.890
the concept behind a property
right is that the state or some

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.828
level of government will have
the capacity to monitor,

00:02:00.828 --> 00:02:05.390
to discover the defect,
to enforce sanctions.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.830
So a second question that you
need to consider is what is the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.639
appropriate level of government
to institute protective policy?

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.110
Should local governments have
this ability?

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.258
Often they don't,
because they have other

00:02:19.258 --> 00:02:22.479
obligations and their financial
background is quiet slight in

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.810
comparison to state governments
or the federal government.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.820
So thinking about the
particular nature of a problem,

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.910
whether it crosses especially
political boundaries.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.912
So many watersheds,
as an example,

00:02:35.912 --> 00:02:39.187
cross political boundaries:
they cross town boundaries,

00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:41.128
they cross state boundaries.
 

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:45.127
Many water bodies provide the
boundary between political

00:02:45.127 --> 00:02:48.110
jurisdictions as well as nation
states.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.601
So thinking about the
appropriate level of government

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:53.283
to the kind of problem you're
interested in managing is a

00:02:53.283 --> 00:02:54.530
really important task.
 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.740
How about participation in
decision making?

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.377
As you think about conservation
strategies, what should be the

00:03:01.377 --> 00:03:04.299
role of the public in
participating in the type of

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.908
strategy that's chosen?
 

00:03:05.908 --> 00:03:10.465
And you might think of a tract
of land that everybody feels is

00:03:10.465 --> 00:03:13.072
very special,
perhaps because it has

00:03:13.072 --> 00:03:16.212
endangered species,
perhaps because of its open

00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:19.770
space character,
perhaps its wildness.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.742
You might think of a variety of
different strategies to protect

00:03:22.742 --> 00:03:24.949
that if it's currently in
private ownership.

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.744
And one of those would be land
acquisition on the part of the

00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:28.348
government.
 

00:03:28.348 --> 00:03:31.258
So many national parks,
for example,

00:03:31.258 --> 00:03:32.970
particularly in the Eastern
United States,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.235
have been created through the
process of land acquisition and

00:03:36.235 --> 00:03:39.180
in some instances,
the exercise of eminent domain.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.750
And we'll talk about eminent
domain,

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.080
where the government uses its
authority to acquire property

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.786
for public purposes virtually by
taking it away from the private

00:03:49.786 --> 00:03:52.550
owner but providing
compensation.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.660
Intensity of regulation.
 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.110
Regulation is another strategy.
 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.931
So you might simply adopt rules
that govern density of allowable

00:04:02.931 --> 00:04:06.758
new development or the type of
new development,

00:04:06.758 --> 00:04:08.550
whether it's residential,
commercial,

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.889
agricultural, industrial.
 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.000
And this is the origin of the
idea of zoning,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.459
land use segregation,
land use density control,

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.120
and often associated
subdivision regulations,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.437
which are very specific and
detail how development has to

00:04:22.437 --> 00:04:24.547
proceed,
including lot sizes,

00:04:24.547 --> 00:04:28.103
shoreline access requirements--
a variety of different

00:04:28.103 --> 00:04:31.329
restrictions are associated with
subdivision regulations.

00:04:31.329 --> 00:04:34.360
How about the legitimacy of
public value?

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.613
If you create a really tough
set of land use regulations and

00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:42.795
the property owners do not
believe in the legitimacy of the

00:04:42.795 --> 00:04:45.442
regulation,
it guarantees that you're going

00:04:45.442 --> 00:04:46.550
to have noncompliance.
 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.430
And noncompliance means that
you're going to have extensive

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.310
surveillance and monitoring
costs and enforcement costs.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.485
So believing in the legitimacy
of the public value is

00:04:55.485 --> 00:04:56.220
important.
 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.312
Often an educational process
has to take place in order for

00:04:59.312 --> 00:05:02.139
people to understand why
regulations are occurring.

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.892
And in many cases,
they're developed and adopted

00:05:05.892 --> 00:05:09.238
to prevent damage,
the damage that might be

00:05:09.238 --> 00:05:13.410
induced by one property owner on
an adjacent private owner.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.327
So the idea of deciding that
you want to build a casino on

00:05:17.327 --> 00:05:20.970
your property--your neighbors
might object to that.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.375
Or perhaps a nightclub,
so that there are a variety of

00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:27.973
different land uses that
threaten other landowners in the

00:05:27.973 --> 00:05:28.810
vicinity.
 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.139
Property value often rises
following conservation efforts.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.163
So the establishment of a park
is very commonly followed by

00:05:37.163 --> 00:05:39.980
adjacent land values increasing
quite dramatically,

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.690
and I'll provide you with a
couple of examples of that.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.399
Density restrictions,
land use segregation,

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:45.240
aesthetics.
 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.999
Increasingly over the past
half-century we've seen zoning

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.423
ordinances being used for the
purpose of controlling

00:05:52.423 --> 00:05:53.430
aesthetics.
 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.286
So aesthetics might be managed
by specifying density

00:05:57.286 --> 00:06:01.220
guidelines, requiring larger and
larger lot sizes.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.050
So in parts of the California
coastal area,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.031
for example,
there are zoning ordinances

00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:08.776
that demand a hundred acres
before a new house might be

00:06:08.776 --> 00:06:09.588
constructed.
 

00:06:09.588 --> 00:06:13.629
This is to preserve the open
space character of the area.

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.521
So thinking about how you
define a desirable or an ideal

00:06:17.521 --> 00:06:21.697
aesthetic that would be your
objective is a pretty difficult

00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:22.829
thing to do.
 

00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:27.644
The Forest Service started
pioneering research into the

00:06:27.644 --> 00:06:32.639
question of what types of
landscapes do people prefer.

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.454
And they were doing this
because they were getting

00:06:35.454 --> 00:06:38.670
increasingly taken to court
because of perceived esthetic

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.910
damage associated with clear
cuts,

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.288
particularly clear cuts that
were visible because of timber

00:06:44.288 --> 00:06:45.920
leases they had allocated.
 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.009
But they would be visible from
nearby wilderness areas.

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.314
So they decided that they would
establish a variety of social

00:06:53.314 --> 00:06:55.863
experiments,
where they would test people's

00:06:55.863 --> 00:06:58.220
preferences for different kinds
of landscapes,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.199
ranging from the wild to the
fully domesticated agricultural

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.480
to intense urban centers.
 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.709
You might be interested in the
results.

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:11.247
And following new regulation,
when does the government have

00:07:11.247 --> 00:07:13.139
the obligation to compensate?
 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:16.656
So supposing I'm a private land
owner and I have fifty acres of

00:07:16.656 --> 00:07:18.915
land,
and you develop a new zoning

00:07:18.915 --> 00:07:22.786
ordinance that tells me that I
have to have twenty-five acres

00:07:22.786 --> 00:07:24.980
before I can build a new house.
 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.600
So that tells me I basically
have two building lots.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.021
Well I thought that I would
have, prior to that regulation,

00:07:31.021 --> 00:07:34.620
perhaps fifty building lots
that might be one acre in size.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.788
So my expectation has been
suddenly changed by the passage

00:07:38.788 --> 00:07:43.250
of law, and my property value
would significantly diminish.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.127
So under what situations does
the government need to

00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:51.690
compensate the private land
owner for regulatory activity?

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.964
Now I'd like to drop you down
onto the case of the

00:07:54.964 --> 00:07:55.899
Adirondacks.
 

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:58.124
But first, I'd like you to
think about the distribution of

00:07:58.124 --> 00:07:59.490
public land in the United
States.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.476
So out of several hundred
million acres of land that are

00:08:02.476 --> 00:08:05.899
currently under the jurisdiction
of the National Park Service or

00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:09.375
the Forest Service or the Bureau
of Land Management or the Bureau

00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:12.127
of Reclamation,
the majority of these lands are

00:08:12.127 --> 00:08:14.088
located in the Western United
States,

00:08:14.088 --> 00:08:15.990
particularly in the mountain
arid region.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.745
If you look at the eastern part
of the United States,

00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:21.923
you can't see this too clearly
because of the light that's on

00:08:21.923 --> 00:08:22.560
up here.
 

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.120
I don't know,
Judith, if it's possible to

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.019
diminish that at all.
 

00:08:25.019 --> 00:08:28.639
But as you move toward northern
New England, you might be able

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:31.843
to make out a patch of landscape
right up in this area,

00:08:31.843 --> 00:08:33.918
and that's the Adirondack Park.
 

00:08:33.918 --> 00:08:37.866
It's one of the largest intact
forests that we've got in the

00:08:37.866 --> 00:08:40.980
eastern United States,
actually one of the largest

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.340
intact forests that we've got in
the lower forty-eight states.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.693
And it also is adjacent to
Vermont, which is adjacent to

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.279
New Hampshire and Maine.
 

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.669
And together,
these are clustered and form

00:08:51.669 --> 00:08:55.110
what is now thought of as the
Northern Forest in the eastern

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.509
part of the country.
 

00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:58.970
And the Adirondacks,
within this zone,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.629
has the longest history of
protection.

00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:04.349
But there are the Green
Mountains and there's the Green

00:09:04.349 --> 00:09:06.731
Mountain National Forest,
and there are the White

00:09:06.731 --> 00:09:09.058
Mountains in adjacent New
Hampshire that spill over into

00:09:09.058 --> 00:09:09.440
Maine.
 

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.943
So there's really quite an
unusual tract of land that has a

00:09:14.943 --> 00:09:18.740
long and curious conservation
history.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.649
Again, a bit of a closer look
at the Adirondacks.

00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:27.059
Now as you look out across this
landscape, you might think of it

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:28.950
as wild and natural.
 

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.250
But in reality,
it's the location of intense

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.398
conflicts over competing
interest groups about how they

00:09:36.398 --> 00:09:39.700
might best gain access to public
lands.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.426
This is the Adirondack Forest
Preserve, protected since the

00:09:43.426 --> 00:09:43.940
1880s.
 

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.841
If you look back at the history
of conservation effort in the

00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:51.215
nation,
Yosemite was deeded to

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:54.398
California in 1864,
Yellowstone--Yellowstone

00:09:54.398 --> 00:09:56.717
National Park,
was created in 1872,

00:09:56.717 --> 00:09:59.808
and Adirondack Forest Preserve
was created in 1885.

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:02.750
It was transformed into a park
a few years later,

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.452
and in 1895,
the New York State Legislature

00:10:06.452 --> 00:10:11.302
passed a Constitutional
amendment so that lands that are

00:10:11.302 --> 00:10:14.830
designated as Forest Reserve
lands,

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.928
are now called Forest Preserve
lands.

00:10:16.928 --> 00:10:19.910
They are forever protected by
the Constitution of New York

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:20.330
State.
 

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.614
So that that means that two
successive Legislatures need to

00:10:24.614 --> 00:10:29.120
enact a statute that would allow
them to be transferred out of

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.450
that category.
 

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.048
So this is a very rigorous
standard that is hard to change.

00:10:34.048 --> 00:10:36.063
And by the way,
there are different kinds of

00:10:36.063 --> 00:10:40.268
laws that might be applied,
such as the executive order by

00:10:40.268 --> 00:10:46.052
William Clinton that created the
largest tract of wilderness by

00:10:46.052 --> 00:10:51.277
relying on federally owned but
non-wilderness lands up in

00:10:51.277 --> 00:10:53.830
Alaska,
just before he left office.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.572
So you could use a federal
executive order to accomplish

00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:57.820
wilderness designation.
 

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.633
Or the Forest Service or the
Parks Service or the Bureau of

00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:05.106
Land Management,
they could also

00:11:05.106 --> 00:11:08.038
administratively designate
tracts of land as being

00:11:08.038 --> 00:11:10.908
wilderness that are under their
jurisdiction.

00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:13.741
So that in terms of the gold
standard of offering the

00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:17.309
greatest amount of protection,
you would want a designation

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:19.840
that would be very difficult to
change.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.340
And New York State and the
legislature I think got it right

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.778
back in the 1890s when they
created the Forest Reserve.

00:11:26.778 --> 00:11:29.552
Jumping ahead,
the Wilderness Statute in the

00:11:29.552 --> 00:11:32.259
United States wasn't adopted
until 1864.

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:36.734
And then in 1968,
the Adirondack National Park

00:11:36.734 --> 00:11:42.798
was proposed by a variety of
individuals in New York State.

00:11:42.798 --> 00:11:45.327
And this upset people in the
Adirondacks quite a bit,

00:11:45.327 --> 00:11:47.710
because they were worried about
losing control.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.870
They were concerned about
losing their authority,

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.029
their ability to effect policy
within their park,

00:11:56.029 --> 00:11:57.850
within the state.
 

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.139
And this prompted the
Legislature to move ahead by

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:06.080
1971 and create the Adirondack
Park Agency.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:13.585
Then by 1973,
the Adirondack Park Agency Land

00:12:13.585 --> 00:12:20.918
Use Plan and Regulation went
into effect.

00:12:20.918 --> 00:12:23.278
And this really will be the
topic of the discussion today.

00:12:23.278 --> 00:12:27.994
Thinking about the forces that
lay behind the development of

00:12:27.994 --> 00:12:31.908
the statute, you might consider
the Erie Canal.

00:12:31.908 --> 00:12:36.772
The Erie Canal runs from the
eastern side of New York all the

00:12:36.772 --> 00:12:38.879
way to the western edge.
 

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:43.708
And when the timber resources
in the park were poorly managed,

00:12:43.708 --> 00:12:47.985
when the tops of trees were
left on the ground and they

00:12:47.985 --> 00:12:50.440
dried out, they would burn.
 

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.154
And forest fires in the 1860s,
'70s, and '80s,

00:12:54.154 --> 00:12:59.270
were really common in response
to these mismanaged forest lands

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.509
drying out.
 

00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:03.389
So what happens when a tract of
forest burns?

00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:07.918
It basically loses its flood
storage capacity,

00:13:07.918 --> 00:13:12.748
the organic matter in the soil
often is released,

00:13:12.748 --> 00:13:14.658
it breaks down.
 

00:13:14.658 --> 00:13:17.682
So that water running off the
landscape commonly floods,

00:13:17.682 --> 00:13:20.870
so you can get a burst into the
rivers and through the Erie

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.850
Canal, and then you get drought.
 

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.081
So that if New York State was
going to insure that commerce

00:13:27.081 --> 00:13:30.048
could move westward,
it had to ensure a more

00:13:30.048 --> 00:13:32.908
sustainable form of forest
management in the park.

00:13:32.908 --> 00:13:37.679
Now also, think about what was
happening in the middle of the

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:39.350
nineteenth century.
 

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.292
There were several movements in
literature and art and also in

00:13:43.292 --> 00:13:47.283
ecology that are quite curious,
and they were colliding in a

00:13:47.283 --> 00:13:51.192
way that really provided impetus
for the creation of parks and

00:13:51.192 --> 00:13:52.408
protected areas.
 

00:13:52.408 --> 00:13:55.889
And one strain of thought,
known as transcendentalism,

00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:59.134
that you can discover in the
writings of Samuel Taylor

00:13:59.134 --> 00:14:01.399
Coleridge,
Shelley, Keats,

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:04.792
William Wordsworth,
Emerson, Whitman,

00:14:04.792 --> 00:14:07.772
and Thoreau,
and particularly Emerson's

00:14:07.772 --> 00:14:10.653
essay on nature,
caused people to think very

00:14:10.653 --> 00:14:13.475
differently about nature and
what it was and its importance

00:14:13.475 --> 00:14:14.740
to the human condition.
 

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:23.110
So that nature to Emerson was
an organism,

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.240
a symbol of the mind,
it was a moral educator,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.013
a source of spiritual truth,
and a resource for the

00:14:29.013 --> 00:14:29.788
imagination.
 

00:14:29.788 --> 00:14:34.538
Now at the same time George
Perkins Marsh was writing,

00:14:34.538 --> 00:14:36.548
and he produced a book called
Man and Nature,

00:14:36.548 --> 00:14:40.490
talking about the destruction
of forests and how that might

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.139
lead to the decline of
civilizations.

00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:46.405
Quite curious,
the writings in the latter part

00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:50.471
of the nineteenth century
presaged the loss of biological

00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:53.754
diversity,
as well as climate change that

00:14:53.754 --> 00:14:55.509
we're now experiencing.
 

00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:57.294
So he wrote,
back in 1864:

00:14:57.294 --> 00:15:01.009
"A condition of
impoverished productiveness,

00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:03.908
of shattered surface,
of climactic excess as to

00:15:03.908 --> 00:15:07.006
threaten deprivation,
barbarism, and even extinction

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:07.960
of species."
 

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.820
So nearly a century and a half
ago,

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.635
a scientist was predicting
climate change associated with

00:15:14.635 --> 00:15:18.928
the way that we were mismanaging
resources and the landscape.

00:15:18.928 --> 00:15:21.394
Also the targets of
transcendentalists include

00:15:21.394 --> 00:15:22.379
Christian views.
 

00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:27.928
They challenged the human role
to be one of dominating nature,

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:31.158
the Christian view that we
should be fruitful and multiply

00:15:31.158 --> 00:15:33.480
and replenish the earth and
subdue it,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.090
and that Christianity denies
souls to non-human species.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.330
These were new and very
interesting thoughts to people.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:45.168
This is captured in a work
produced by Roderick Nash,

00:15:45.168 --> 00:15:46.990
Wilderness and the American
Mind,

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.518
that's published by Yale Press
that I commend to you if you're

00:15:50.518 --> 00:15:53.990
interested in following the way
that these ideas collided.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.322
Now at the same time,
there were many artists that

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:59.275
were painting landscapes both in
the western part of the nation

00:15:59.275 --> 00:16:01.922
as well as in the east,
including Thomas Cole and

00:16:01.922 --> 00:16:04.200
Albert Bierstadt,
Winslow Homer,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.120
and Frederic Church.
 

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.450
And they all painted in the
Adirondacks.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.947
So think about the fact that
people were reading the

00:16:10.947 --> 00:16:14.995
transcendentalist literature at
the same time that these art

00:16:14.995 --> 00:16:18.907
shows were traveling around not
just the United States but

00:16:18.907 --> 00:16:22.966
traveling around the world,
giving people a very different

00:16:22.966 --> 00:16:26.480
impression of what it was like
in the more remote parts of the

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.460
United States.
 

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.307
So Winslow Homer has painted
more in the Adirondacks than the

00:16:31.307 --> 00:16:33.395
others,
so I just thought I'd show you

00:16:33.395 --> 00:16:37.393
his work on Two Guides,
the Hunter, and the Fisherman,

00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:41.317
basically celebrating the
experience of being the

00:16:41.317 --> 00:16:42.298
outdoors.
 

00:16:42.298 --> 00:16:45.537
I'm going to fast forward on
you to the middle part of the

00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:49.067
twentieth century,
when you recall that I argued

00:16:49.067 --> 00:16:53.422
that the interstate highway
system was built largely in

00:16:53.422 --> 00:16:56.889
response to concerns about the
Cold War.

00:16:56.889 --> 00:17:01.412
But this network eventually
ringed the Adirondack Park and

00:17:01.412 --> 00:17:05.855
it made it accessible by the
early 1960s to more than ten

00:17:05.855 --> 00:17:09.028
million people within a day's
drive.

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:13.574
So access is really a critical
determinant of property value

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:16.269
and also the rate of
development.

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:22.009
By the 1960s,
mid-sixties and 1970s,

00:17:22.009 --> 00:17:25.394
increasing leisurely time,
increasing demand for

00:17:25.394 --> 00:17:29.644
recreational opportunities led
to increasing property values

00:17:29.644 --> 00:17:31.588
within the Adirondacks.
 

00:17:31.588 --> 00:17:33.420
People were looking for second
homes.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.682
The development industry was
booming not just here but also

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:42.313
in the vicinity of Bar Harbor in
Maine and the vicinity of Grand

00:17:42.313 --> 00:17:46.057
Teton in Jackson,
Wyoming, also in the Sierras,

00:17:46.057 --> 00:17:50.384
so that the population in the
United States wanted access to

00:17:50.384 --> 00:17:53.098
remote recreational
opportunities.

00:17:53.098 --> 00:17:57.377
There was a real interest in
wildness and nature,

00:17:57.377 --> 00:18:01.298
particularly in the concept of
wilderness.

00:18:01.298 --> 00:18:04.597
And quite honestly,
I'm surprised at your

00:18:04.597 --> 00:18:05.670
generation.
 

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:10.136
I don't see the same interest
in wildness or wilderness that

00:18:10.136 --> 00:18:14.832
was very prominent in people's
concerns about conservation back

00:18:14.832 --> 00:18:16.118
in the 1970s.
 

00:18:16.118 --> 00:18:20.641
So that many in the Legislature
in New York became concerned

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:25.317
about development being financed
with international capital in

00:18:25.317 --> 00:18:28.156
the park,
rapid cutting of the forest,

00:18:28.156 --> 00:18:30.343
rapid development--
particularly along

00:18:30.343 --> 00:18:32.960
shorelines--and rapid increases
in property value.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.641
In some communities,
communities that had

00:18:36.641 --> 00:18:42.163
populations of only 300 people,
new projects were proposed up

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:45.108
to 10,000 new units in size.
 

00:18:45.108 --> 00:18:49.423
If you then extrapolate that
one new housing unit might house

00:18:49.423 --> 00:18:53.685
on average two to three people,
this could multiply the

00:18:53.685 --> 00:18:58.029
population of a community by ten
or even twenty times.

00:18:58.029 --> 00:19:00.390
So what would that mean for
that community?

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.929
What would it mean in terms of
its need to invest in

00:19:02.929 --> 00:19:05.019
institutional support for the
community?

00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:06.640
And by that what do I mean?
 

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.834
Well how about road
development, highway

00:19:08.834 --> 00:19:11.308
development, school systems,
fire, police?

00:19:11.308 --> 00:19:14.746
So that economic pressure was
being brought to bear on these

00:19:14.746 --> 00:19:18.066
communities that already were
the most impoverished in New

00:19:18.066 --> 00:19:18.940
York State.
 

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.766
That band of forest that I
pointed out to you in northern

00:19:21.766 --> 00:19:24.338
New England is demographically
quite interesting.

00:19:24.338 --> 00:19:28.278
It's grown to be bimodal in
terms of income distribution and

00:19:28.278 --> 00:19:30.950
dominated more heavily by the
poorest.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.174
But also, there are increasing
numbers of private property

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.400
owners who own second homes.
 

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.167
But they don't vote there,
they don't vote in the

00:19:40.167 --> 00:19:43.630
Adirondacks and many of them
don't vote in New York State.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.642
So that this bimodal
distribution creates a very

00:19:47.642 --> 00:19:52.184
interesting political dynamic,
a tension between those that

00:19:52.184 --> 00:19:54.650
have always lived there that are
poor,

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:58.069
as opposed to those that have
the capacity to buy the new

00:19:58.069 --> 00:20:01.001
houses and bring their
conservation values to the

00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:01.980
Adirondacks.
 

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.180
So this statute was really
unusual.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.989
And the preamble to the statute
includes this language:

00:20:07.989 --> 00:20:10.747
"Local governments in the
Adirondack Park find it

00:20:10.747 --> 00:20:13.867
increasingly difficult to cope
with the unrelenting pressures

00:20:13.867 --> 00:20:17.041
for development being brought to
bear on the area and exercise

00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:20.215
their discretionary powers to
create an effective land use and

00:20:20.215 --> 00:20:22.608
development control
framework."

00:20:22.608 --> 00:20:26.250
Now, the mission statement of
this law is really quite

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.373
complex: "The basic purpose
of this article is to ensure

00:20:30.373 --> 00:20:34.721
optimum overall conservation,
protection, preservation,

00:20:34.721 --> 00:20:38.180
development and use of the
unique scenic,

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.279
esthetic, wildlife,
recreational,

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:42.387
open space,
historic, ecological,

00:20:42.387 --> 00:20:45.328
and natural resources of the
Adirondack Park."

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:47.867
So within this mission
statement, you should

00:20:47.867 --> 00:20:50.818
immediately see a number of
potential conflicts.

00:20:50.818 --> 00:20:54.714
How can you at once maximize
conservation at the same time

00:20:54.714 --> 00:20:57.450
you're maximizing development
and use?

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.519
Actually, it's interesting.
 

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:02.665
If you drive into a national
forest, you'll see a sign beside

00:21:02.665 --> 00:21:05.759
the edge of the road when you
enter all national forests.

00:21:05.759 --> 00:21:09.740
And the sign will say
"Land of Many Uses."

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.213
Land of many uses,
well how do you reconcile

00:21:13.213 --> 00:21:17.820
multiple uses within one tract
of land managed by a public

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:18.710
agency?
 

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.087
Well, it's difficult at best,
and that's largely part of the

00:21:22.087 --> 00:21:22.890
story today.
 

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.828
Innovative requirements in this
statute demanded an ecological

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:27.538
analysis.
 

00:21:27.538 --> 00:21:31.339
So what is the resiliency of
different ecological zones?

00:21:31.339 --> 00:21:33.368
Different ecosystems?
 

00:21:33.368 --> 00:21:37.808
How much development can they
sustain, and is there a logic

00:21:37.808 --> 00:21:42.172
behind allocating a density
requirement to different types

00:21:42.172 --> 00:21:43.548
of ecosystems?
 

00:21:43.548 --> 00:21:46.578
How about density regulations
and the clustering concept?

00:21:46.578 --> 00:21:50.462
This statute relied on the idea
that you should concentrate new

00:21:50.462 --> 00:21:54.221
development in close proximity
to village centers so that you

00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:57.855
don't overstress the local
government's need to develop new

00:21:57.855 --> 00:22:00.308
roads,
to maintain those roads,

00:22:00.308 --> 00:22:02.700
and also require new power
lines,

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.630
new sewage lines,
new water lines.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:08.478
So the idea that cluster
development builds on existing

00:22:08.478 --> 00:22:12.470
centers of the population is
really quite interesting.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.818
And this was to protect the
open space character as well as

00:22:15.818 --> 00:22:19.400
the ecological characteristics
of the surrounding landscape.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.308
It wasn't designed really to
conserve energy.

00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:28.122
But if I were going to
challenge you to design today a

00:22:28.122 --> 00:22:33.751
land use regulatory scheme that
would be the most conserving of

00:22:33.751 --> 00:22:37.680
energy resources,
it probably would follow this

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.741
model and it would follow the
model because if you have people

00:22:41.741 --> 00:22:45.721
living closer together,
you are clearly not going to

00:22:45.721 --> 00:22:50.472
use as much fuel moving around
between shopping and recreation

00:22:50.472 --> 00:22:53.200
and school and other activities.
 

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.578
So if you increase the density
restriction,

00:22:58.578 --> 00:23:02.570
you increase the amount of land
area required before a new house

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.740
might be developed between the
village centers,

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.808
then that would discourage
development in those areas.

00:23:08.808 --> 00:23:12.730
And in the case of the park,
inside the centers there is no

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.690
density restriction at all.
 

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.862
So it's an encouragement
basically to build up between

00:23:17.862 --> 00:23:19.180
the village centers.
 

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.769
In the more remote areas,
there's a requirement that you

00:23:21.769 --> 00:23:24.358
have forty-two acres before a
new house can be built.

00:23:24.358 --> 00:23:26.009
Forty-two acres is a lot of
land.

00:23:26.009 --> 00:23:29.393
Forty-two acres in Connecticut,
most of Connecticut is zoned on

00:23:29.393 --> 00:23:31.140
average one acre per new unit.
 

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.259
So forty-two units might be
placed on that zone.

00:23:34.259 --> 00:23:36.747
But only one could be placed on
that area within the

00:23:36.747 --> 00:23:37.430
Adirondacks.
 

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.700
It also required setback
requirements.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.124
Setback requirements,
setback requirements from

00:23:43.124 --> 00:23:45.759
especially water bodies,
streams and lakeshores.

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:49.661
And this wild-to-urban
continuum was designed really

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:54.020
with an aesthetic purpose,
to try to protect the park-like

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.009
character of the area.
 

00:23:56.009 --> 00:23:59.972
It also had a provision that
was really new back in the 1970s

00:23:59.972 --> 00:24:03.538
to offer specific protection for
agricultural lands.

00:24:03.538 --> 00:24:07.017
So that agricultural lands were
thought of not the way that we

00:24:07.017 --> 00:24:10.288
would think of them today,
as providing an opportunity for

00:24:10.288 --> 00:24:13.368
locally-grown produce that would
be more energy efficient.

00:24:13.368 --> 00:24:16.539
But they were designed
predominately to protect the

00:24:16.539 --> 00:24:18.759
open space character of the
park.

00:24:18.759 --> 00:24:21.827
Vista preservation so that
individual vistas were

00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:22.660
identified.
 

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:26.250
Actually, that's kind of an
interesting sidelight story

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.980
about how that occurred.
 

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.940
One might think that there
really might not be a legally

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.116
defensible means of going out
and identifying what the most

00:24:36.116 --> 00:24:39.430
beautiful areas are in an area
this large.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.548
So the Adirondacks is roughly
six million acres in size.

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:45.545
It's larger than Yosemite,
Yellowstone,

00:24:45.545 --> 00:24:47.750
and Glacier National Parks put
together.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.472
So that wandering around and
trying to figure out where the

00:24:51.472 --> 00:24:55.325
ideal vistas are located was a
challenge that the park agency

00:24:55.325 --> 00:24:56.608
had to confront.
 

00:24:56.608 --> 00:24:59.338
They were required to do that
by statute.

00:24:59.338 --> 00:25:02.237
The reality of how they did it
is that an engineer and a

00:25:02.237 --> 00:25:05.450
surveyor got into a pickup truck
with a case of beer and drove

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.663
around for a weekend looking for
what they thought were pretty

00:25:08.663 --> 00:25:09.558
landscapes.
 

00:25:09.558 --> 00:25:13.410
They put pins in a map,
and lo and behold,

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:18.227
these pinholes in the maps
translated into legally binding

00:25:18.227 --> 00:25:22.959
regulations that prevented
development of different forms

00:25:22.959 --> 00:25:26.338
in the vicinity of the scenic
vista.

00:25:26.338 --> 00:25:30.170
Wetlands in wild and scenic and
recreational rivers were also

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.000
designated.
 

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.284
The definition of a wetland is
actually quite interesting and

00:25:34.284 --> 00:25:35.269
quite difficult.
 

00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:38.792
Today as I was coming in to
give the lecture,

00:25:38.792 --> 00:25:43.198
I noticed that areas that
normally look dry had standing

00:25:43.198 --> 00:25:44.640
water on them.
 

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:50.332
So that low-lying areas can be
quite deceptive if you're not

00:25:50.332 --> 00:25:53.710
there during extreme rain
events.

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:57.001
So that wetland designation
gave the Adirondack Park Agency

00:25:57.001 --> 00:25:58.990
jurisdiction to deny
development.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.413
People were not allowed to
build in wetlands,

00:26:01.413 --> 00:26:01.910
period.
 

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:05.159
Now most states have wetlands
laws as well,

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:07.480
not just in the Adirondacks.
 

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.993
Most states do not have wild,
scenic, and recreational river

00:26:10.993 --> 00:26:14.627
statutes that provide an overlay
on top of the Adirondack Park

00:26:14.627 --> 00:26:15.759
Agency statute.
 

00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:20.169
Finally, the provision that
stirred terrific controversy was

00:26:20.169 --> 00:26:24.503
that the zoning authority that
previously was held by local

00:26:24.503 --> 00:26:28.538
governments was overtaken by the
state government.

00:26:28.538 --> 00:26:31.643
So not only would you have
private property owners that

00:26:31.643 --> 00:26:35.090
would be highly resistant to
this new set of very complicated

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:38.538
regulations that they viewed
actually took away their private

00:26:38.538 --> 00:26:41.930
property rights and diminished
their property value,

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:46.554
but they also had local
governments that felt that they

00:26:46.554 --> 00:26:49.980
were being pushed out of the
picture,

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.529
that their zoning
responsibility that they'd had

00:26:52.529 --> 00:26:55.604
for more than a hundred years,
that that was taken away from

00:26:55.604 --> 00:26:55.868
them.
 

00:26:55.868 --> 00:26:57.955
So that the statute set up
class A projects,

00:26:57.955 --> 00:27:00.866
which were large development
projects that might have more of

00:27:00.866 --> 00:27:02.078
a regional influence.
 

00:27:02.078 --> 00:27:04.009
And those were reviewed by the
state.

00:27:04.009 --> 00:27:06.980
And class B projects were
reviewed by local governments

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.732
but only if the local
governments adopted the state

00:27:09.732 --> 00:27:11.990
standards to apply to those
projects.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:16.349
So if you were given the
responsibility to develop an

00:27:16.349 --> 00:27:20.795
ecologically grounded approach
to land use regulation,

00:27:20.795 --> 00:27:22.640
what would you do?
 

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.614
Well, you probably would go off
and conduct an inventory of what

00:27:26.614 --> 00:27:28.759
resources are there in the park.
 

00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:32.608
You'd look for aquifers;
you'd map them out.

00:27:32.608 --> 00:27:35.607
You'd map out surface waters
and you'd map out setback

00:27:35.607 --> 00:27:38.719
distances from those surface
waters to try to be sure to

00:27:38.719 --> 00:27:40.190
protect water quality.
 

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:44.444
You'd take a look surficial
geology, particularly areas that

00:27:44.444 --> 00:27:48.338
had shallow soils or soils that
had clay beneath it.

00:27:48.338 --> 00:27:50.259
Adirondacks is rather famous
for its clay,

00:27:50.259 --> 00:27:54.307
which means that you have a
clay, impervious surface that is

00:27:54.307 --> 00:27:57.598
often only one or two feet
beneath the top of the

00:27:57.598 --> 00:27:58.558
landscape.
 

00:27:58.558 --> 00:28:01.720
That means that if you're going
to put in a septic system--

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.451
and a septic system basically
means that human sewage from a

00:28:05.451 --> 00:28:08.298
facility or a house goes down
into a pipe,

00:28:08.298 --> 00:28:11.519
it goes into a holding tank
where solids settle out,

00:28:11.519 --> 00:28:14.675
and then fluid drains off and
it leaches out through pipes

00:28:14.675 --> 00:28:18.220
that have holes in the bottom of
them and then down through a bed

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.645
of sand--
but if there is a clay area

00:28:20.645 --> 00:28:23.613
that lies beneath the sand,
that means that the sewage is

00:28:23.613 --> 00:28:25.058
going to stay close to the
surface,

00:28:25.058 --> 00:28:28.130
it's not going to dissipate,
it's not going to break down,

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:31.713
and it means that bacterial
contamination of surface water

00:28:31.713 --> 00:28:33.788
supplies is much more probable.
 

00:28:33.788 --> 00:28:37.390
General soils characteristics
were also mapped.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.057
Elevation was mapped,
and I'll tell you more about

00:28:40.057 --> 00:28:42.509
that in just a second,
as well as land use.

00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:43.940
Where are the residential areas?
 

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.647
So that the idea of clustering
development in close proximity

00:28:47.647 --> 00:28:50.986
to where existing development
was was a critical way of

00:28:50.986 --> 00:28:52.470
thinking about this.
 

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:56.798
Now, land cover also was
considered,

00:28:56.798 --> 00:28:59.519
so whether or not the tract of
land was forested,

00:28:59.519 --> 00:29:02.126
whether or not it was
heathland, whether or not it was

00:29:02.126 --> 00:29:02.618
wetland.
 

00:29:02.618 --> 00:29:05.890
So that the biological
resources were also mapped.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:09.220
On top of where did the state
lands lie.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.048
So there are 107 towns and
villages in the Adirondack Park.

00:29:12.048 --> 00:29:15.799
So 107 different local
governments that were upset with

00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:19.759
the State of New York for taking
their authority away,

00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:22.000
but they all had to go through
this mapping process.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.192
So those of you that are
familiar with geographic

00:29:25.192 --> 00:29:28.715
information systems know that
this process now goes on

00:29:28.715 --> 00:29:29.980
electronically.
 

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.371
So soils and vegetation and
land use and property ownership

00:29:34.371 --> 00:29:36.746
patterns,
they're all piled on top of one

00:29:36.746 --> 00:29:39.586
another electronically so you
can zoom in or you could change

00:29:39.586 --> 00:29:41.808
the layers that you're looking
at instantly.

00:29:41.808 --> 00:29:44.643
In this case,
they drew these maps out by

00:29:44.643 --> 00:29:47.002
hand,
and that actually led to some

00:29:47.002 --> 00:29:50.960
pretty interesting problems when
private landowners would come to

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.239
the government and say,
"You know,

00:29:53.239 --> 00:29:54.618
I'm not certain what zone I'm
in.

00:29:54.618 --> 00:29:56.118
I appear to be on a
boundary."

00:29:56.118 --> 00:30:00.820
And it turned out that by
drawing a line on a map that is

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:05.857
really small in scale that the
width of the line itself was a

00:30:05.857 --> 00:30:07.788
hundred yards wide.
 

00:30:07.788 --> 00:30:11.861
And a hundred yards may or may
not include all the property of

00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:12.930
an individual.
 

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.808
So which section would they lie
within?

00:30:14.808 --> 00:30:19.726
The forty-two acre zone or
perhaps the three-point-two acre

00:30:19.726 --> 00:30:20.318
zone?
 

00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:23.337
It made a huge difference in
the eventual salability and

00:30:23.337 --> 00:30:24.930
property value of the area.
 

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.998
And also proximity to roads:
I mean, if you think about an

00:30:27.998 --> 00:30:31.390
area, you would also want to
know where the road network was.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:35.579
You would think very carefully
about how you would allocate

00:30:35.579 --> 00:30:38.470
density based upon access to
roadways.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.505
So all of this information was
put together to develop this

00:30:42.505 --> 00:30:44.940
map, which is a legal
instrument.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.675
The idea that a map might be a
legal instrument is kind of an

00:30:47.675 --> 00:30:48.680
interesting thought.
 

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.806
So that in order for someone to
know what their rights are,

00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:54.663
their property rights are,
they would have to pinpoint

00:30:54.663 --> 00:30:56.118
themselves on this map.
 

00:30:56.118 --> 00:30:59.853
And each color is associated
with a certain density

00:30:59.853 --> 00:31:00.750
allowance.
 

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:04.230
So if you are located in the
green, that means that you need

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:07.180
forty-two acres in order to
develop a new house.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.970
If you're located in the
yellow, that's eight acres.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.798
If you're located in the red,
then you only need one acre.

00:31:13.798 --> 00:31:16.210
And if you're located in the
village centers that's

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.669
designated as brown,
you have no density requirement

00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:19.200
at all.
 

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.380
By the way, you've heard about
cap and trade.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.689
Well the cap and trade idea can
be applied very well to a

00:31:26.689 --> 00:31:27.990
situation like this.
 

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:31.231
So that you might allow trading
rights under certain

00:31:31.231 --> 00:31:34.346
circumstances within a
designated boundary perhaps

00:31:34.346 --> 00:31:35.808
within a community.
 

00:31:35.808 --> 00:31:38.973
So that the idea of
transferable development rights

00:31:38.973 --> 00:31:41.950
is something that we'll talk
about next week.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.060
So these are the different
zoning limits that have been

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.230
established by law and have
governed the Adirondack Park

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:51.630
Agency's implementation of this
plan for quite a while.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.710
How does this play out as
you're looking at a landscape?

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.590
Well here is a little
community, it's a community of

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:00.318
Keene Valley that is just at the
foot of the high peaks region,

00:32:00.318 --> 00:32:02.259
the highest mountains in New
York State.

00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:06.068
And this is a community of
about 800 people.

00:32:06.068 --> 00:32:09.930
And here is the village center
with no density requirements.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.180
And as you move away from the
village center,

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.737
you find that you're required
to have larger and larger lots

00:32:15.737 --> 00:32:18.150
before you can build a new
structure,

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:22.413
until you reach the public
lands, which begin in this case

00:32:22.413 --> 00:32:26.528
up on these hillsides leading up
into the high peaks.

00:32:26.528 --> 00:32:30.203
So that you can think about
this as a kind of a set of

00:32:30.203 --> 00:32:31.660
concentric circles.
 

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.630
It's much more complicated than
just concentric circles,

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:38.505
but development ranging from
the urban center on one hand to

00:32:38.505 --> 00:32:42.250
wilderness areas that are
designated on the other hand.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.823
So that the public lands have
their own set of regulations

00:32:45.823 --> 00:32:47.140
under this statute.
 

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.338
The village of Lake Placid,
where the Olympic Games were

00:32:49.338 --> 00:32:50.940
held, provides a good example of
this.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.333
Where you see the brown in the
center is the area where there

00:32:54.333 --> 00:32:56.029
are no density requirements.
 

00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:59.346
And then the lands that border
the federal wilderness areas

00:32:59.346 --> 00:33:02.330
designated by this blue,
they have the higher

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.213
restrictions,
the requirements for larger

00:33:05.213 --> 00:33:06.079
acreages.
 

00:33:06.079 --> 00:33:08.180
So where are battlegrounds?
 

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.670
Where would you imagine you
would get the most litigation?

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:16.115
Where would you find the
greatest amount of private

00:33:16.115 --> 00:33:19.818
conflict over these regulations?
 

00:33:19.818 --> 00:33:23.740
Well one clearly would be areas
with views.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.872
So areas that have high
elevations or areas that are

00:33:27.872 --> 00:33:30.058
adjacent to water bodies.
 

00:33:30.058 --> 00:33:33.210
So if you were going to map out
property values,

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:36.150
you find that areas that had
the best views,

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.692
that had the highest elevation,
and that were adjacent to

00:33:38.692 --> 00:33:41.509
either rivers or lakes or ponds
would have the highest property

00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:42.009
values.
 

00:33:42.009 --> 00:33:45.321
So you could be predictive
about this, about where you're

00:33:45.321 --> 00:33:48.397
going to receive your greatest
amount of conflict and

00:33:48.397 --> 00:33:50.348
resistance to new regulation.
 

00:33:50.348 --> 00:33:54.579
When property values are
highest, you'll find people are

00:33:54.579 --> 00:33:56.578
most anxious to develop.
 

00:33:56.578 --> 00:34:00.233
The rate of development occurs
more rapidly along roadways,

00:34:00.233 --> 00:34:01.808
along lakes and rivers.
 

00:34:01.808 --> 00:34:06.435
The cost of developing in the
mountainous areas at higher

00:34:06.435 --> 00:34:10.320
elevation are more prohibitive
to developers.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.932
So shorelines,
such as this example on

00:34:13.932 --> 00:34:19.206
lakeshores are extremely
desirable from the perspective

00:34:19.206 --> 00:34:23.943
of a developer--
multi-million dollar boathouses

00:34:23.943 --> 00:34:26.460
that have been constructed.
 

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:31.929
Also, hotels and large camps on
islands.

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:35.052
There are more than 1,000
islands on Adirondack lakes and

00:34:35.052 --> 00:34:35.500
ponds.
 

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:39.239
Here's one of them in Lake
George, as an example.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:44.503
Lake George provides the water
supply for its town so that the

00:34:44.503 --> 00:34:49.679
water is treated with chlorine,
like New Haven's water is.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:51.570
It's filtered in a very rough
way through sand.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:54.032
But it's not filtered by
activated carbon,

00:34:54.032 --> 00:34:57.456
which could remove a variety of
different kinds of organic

00:34:57.456 --> 00:35:00.400
pollutants that might be in the
water supply.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:05.635
So in this situation,
if this facility had its own

00:35:05.635 --> 00:35:08.748
leaching field,
we'd be worried about it,

00:35:08.748 --> 00:35:11.554
because most of the islands in
the Adirondacks are basically

00:35:11.554 --> 00:35:14.360
mounds of bedrock that have very
shallow soils on them,

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.139
that have very low capacity to
absorb human sewage,

00:35:18.139 --> 00:35:21.186
so that there is considerable
conflict between the developers'

00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:24.182
interest to build adjacent to
water bodies and the concern of

00:35:24.182 --> 00:35:26.880
these communities to protect
their water supplies.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.346
Another good example over prime
development land from the

00:35:31.346 --> 00:35:35.972
perspective of the investor
would be a scenic vista such as

00:35:35.972 --> 00:35:36.690
this.
 

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:41.931
This is one of the forty-odd
scenic vistas that have specific

00:35:41.931 --> 00:35:44.289
development restrictions.
 

00:35:44.289 --> 00:35:48.173
So that it sits just adjacent
to Mount Van Hoevenberg and

00:35:48.173 --> 00:35:50.809
overlooks the Adirondack high
peaks.

00:35:50.809 --> 00:35:53.219
And a developer,
McDonald's Corporation,

00:35:53.219 --> 00:35:56.914
decided this was a site that
they wanted to put a McDonald's

00:35:56.914 --> 00:36:00.110
up for when they preparing for
the Olympic Games.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:04.762
They didn't want to go next to
Wendy's or to build their golden

00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:06.940
arch next to a Burger King.
 

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:10.317
And there was a strip already
built in Lake Placid just

00:36:10.317 --> 00:36:10.880
nearby.
 

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.713
But their vision of what might
look best in this area was

00:36:14.713 --> 00:36:16.219
something like this.
 

00:36:16.219 --> 00:36:19.518
Well, the restrictions in the
map,

00:36:19.518 --> 00:36:24.456
the fact that the surveyor and
the other Park Agency employee

00:36:24.456 --> 00:36:29.557
had put a pin in this area gave
the State of New York to deny a

00:36:29.557 --> 00:36:34.659
permit to this developer simply
based on esthetic grounds.

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:37.985
The developer eventually did
construct a MacDonald's next to

00:36:37.985 --> 00:36:41.309
the Wendy's and Burger Kings on
the strip in Lake Placid.

00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:44.586
Here's another example of a
developer that proposed a

00:36:44.586 --> 00:36:48.306
several-hundred unit condominium
complex on the edge of Lake

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:49.000
Placid.
 

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.706
Lake Placid,
like Lake George,

00:36:50.706 --> 00:36:54.119
also provides water from the
lake to its community as their

00:36:54.119 --> 00:36:55.650
drinking water source.
 

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:59.724
And they're very sensitive
about different threats to it,

00:36:59.724 --> 00:37:04.018
whether or not it's motorboat
use or whether or not it's new

00:37:04.018 --> 00:37:06.420
development on the lakeshore.
 

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.862
This is a very large and
beautiful lake,

00:37:08.862 --> 00:37:11.869
and the water quality is
extraordinarily high.

00:37:11.869 --> 00:37:15.197
So here you see that part of
this complex is a golf course,

00:37:15.197 --> 00:37:17.836
but they wanted to build
hundreds of additional

00:37:17.836 --> 00:37:19.099
condominium units.
 

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:22.509
And the argument that a
developer will make is often

00:37:22.509 --> 00:37:25.250
what I call technologically
optimistic.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:28.817
You know, we can build this
without causing any decline in

00:37:28.817 --> 00:37:30.820
water quality within the lake.
 

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.972
We will have the state of the
art sewage treatment system,

00:37:33.972 --> 00:37:36.739
we will be sure that no sewage
reaches the lake.

00:37:36.739 --> 00:37:39.210
We will also construct our
buildings,

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:41.030
which they wanted on the edge
of the lake,

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:44.690
in a way that would not cause
sediment to flow into the lake

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:47.980
so that there would be no
diminished water clarity.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:51.831
The water clarity issue is
often a very significant point

00:37:51.831 --> 00:37:54.860
of debate with respect to new
development.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.414
In Lake Tahoe,
it's been extremely important

00:37:57.414 --> 00:38:00.684
because the clarity of Lake
Tahoe, for those of you that

00:38:00.684 --> 00:38:03.239
have been there,
is exceptionally high.

00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:05.574
They measure this by a Secchi
disk reading,

00:38:05.574 --> 00:38:08.800
which is just a disk that they
drop down into the water.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.257
And you can see that disk in
Lake Tahoe at about fifty feet

00:38:12.257 --> 00:38:15.000
in depth, which is really pretty
remarkable.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.023
But gradually,
over several decades,

00:38:17.023 --> 00:38:19.623
the visibility declined,
and it was because of

00:38:19.623 --> 00:38:21.590
development on the lakeshores.
 

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:26.010
It was because of sedimentation
and also runoff from adjacent

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:30.208
agricultural uses or say runoff
from streets and roads and

00:38:30.208 --> 00:38:34.630
parking lots that were building
up inside the watershed.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:38.081
So that most communities that
have lakes of extremely high

00:38:38.081 --> 00:38:41.532
quality have this concern,
and it justifies their adopting

00:38:41.532 --> 00:38:43.409
tougher zoning regulations.
 

00:38:43.409 --> 00:38:45.822
In this case,
when I worked in the

00:38:45.822 --> 00:38:48.856
Adirondacks,
I happened to be responsible

00:38:48.856 --> 00:38:52.452
for the State of New York's
review of the project and

00:38:52.452 --> 00:38:56.601
remember very distinctly the
initial proposal and my response

00:38:56.601 --> 00:38:59.990
requesting additional
information that was about a

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:04.141
fifty-page letter that I and
colleagues wrote that we felt we

00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:08.083
needed in order to understand
the environmental impacts of

00:39:08.083 --> 00:39:10.849
this development on the lake.
 

00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:14.067
Well, the developer decided
that they would scale the

00:39:14.067 --> 00:39:16.480
development back quite
substantially.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.204
They wanted a marina,
for example,

00:39:18.204 --> 00:39:21.289
that would be suitable for at
least a hundred motorboats.

00:39:21.289 --> 00:39:24.469
But the villagers in Lake
Placid didn't want motorboats.

00:39:24.469 --> 00:39:29.659
Motors on boats are notoriously
inefficient,

00:39:29.659 --> 00:39:35.751
meaning that much of the fuel
is burned but there is a

00:39:35.751 --> 00:39:38.326
proportion,
at that point in time,

00:39:38.326 --> 00:39:41.005
it was between ten and twelve
percent for the standard engines

00:39:41.005 --> 00:39:42.719
that were being used on
motorboats,

00:39:42.719 --> 00:39:44.869
is simply shunted into the
water.

00:39:44.869 --> 00:39:49.893
So that slicks are common
around marinas that really are

00:39:49.893 --> 00:39:52.909
evidence of their inefficiency.
 

00:39:52.909 --> 00:39:55.932
So gradually,
the proposal was whittled back

00:39:55.932 --> 00:39:59.590
from several hundred units to
several dozen units.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.340
The developer agreed not to
build the marina.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:06.777
And he agreed also to put the
buildings back further from the

00:40:06.777 --> 00:40:10.697
water to protect it from
sedimentation and protect the

00:40:10.697 --> 00:40:12.030
water clarity.
 

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:17.844
And the total amount of
impervious surface allowed was

00:40:17.844 --> 00:40:19.820
also restricted.
 

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.710
So the number of parking
spaces, for example,

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:28.282
or the size of the tract of
land that they owned that could

00:40:28.282 --> 00:40:31.989
actually be covered by an
impervious surface.

00:40:31.989 --> 00:40:35.195
So these are all regulatory
tools and strategies that could

00:40:35.195 --> 00:40:36.909
be used to protect this area.
 

00:40:36.909 --> 00:40:38.909
In addition,
a darker color for the

00:40:38.909 --> 00:40:42.440
buildings was required and
building height was restricted.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.829
And this was to protect the
character of the area.

00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:48.038
If you were looking at this
site from the middle of Lake

00:40:48.038 --> 00:40:51.246
Placid looking back at the
mountain peaks and looking at

00:40:51.246 --> 00:40:53.639
the public lands that lie back
here,

00:40:53.639 --> 00:40:55.518
it's a very natural looking
landscape,

00:40:55.518 --> 00:41:00.349
and that was something that was
protected by the statute.

00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:03.539
So that the Adirondack Park
Agency had the authority to say,

00:41:03.539 --> 00:41:05.782
"Sorry,
you've got to make sure that

00:41:05.782 --> 00:41:09.201
your building is dark in color
and that it's not higher than X

00:41:09.201 --> 00:41:10.210
stories."
 

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:17.028
So that what's really driving
the concern about this is

00:41:17.028 --> 00:41:21.864
underlying instincts,
underlying ideologies about

00:41:21.864 --> 00:41:25.476
appropriate uses of land and
appropriate definitions of

00:41:25.476 --> 00:41:28.659
private property rights,
a libertarian instinct as

00:41:28.659 --> 00:41:30.650
opposed to an authoritarian
instinct.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:35.197
So the longtime residents of
the Adirondacks would march down

00:41:35.197 --> 00:41:39.213
the street with the American
flag and argue that their

00:41:39.213 --> 00:41:41.731
freedom,
that their liberty was being

00:41:41.731 --> 00:41:44.904
violated by this Communist
organization that has taken away

00:41:44.904 --> 00:41:47.639
their property rights and not
compensated them.

00:41:47.639 --> 00:41:50.838
So the centralization of
authority has been the primary

00:41:50.838 --> 00:41:53.682
mechanism of effecting
conservation policy in the

00:41:53.682 --> 00:41:54.750
United States.
 

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:59.336
Taking the private property
rights or assuming authority to

00:41:59.336 --> 00:42:04.320
control public lands is a form
of concentration of authority.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.289
Also, the ideology of
utilitarianism,

00:42:07.289 --> 00:42:11.418
that these resources are there
for human benefit and human use

00:42:11.418 --> 00:42:14.940
and we ought to be allowed to
gain access to them.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.617
We ought to be able to cut down
the timber on Forest Preserve

00:42:17.617 --> 00:42:17.929
land.
 

00:42:17.929 --> 00:42:22.282
We ought to be able to ride our
snowmobiles across these trails

00:42:22.282 --> 00:42:25.090
that the preservationists'
instincts,

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:27.909
their concern about the noise,
about the air pollution,

00:42:27.909 --> 00:42:32.449
their concern about dense
populations in wild areas,

00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:38.244
that that was something that
was less important than freedom

00:42:38.244 --> 00:42:44.530
of access and the right of the
people to make use of the land.

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:49.146
So, some of the towns already
had a high percentage of

00:42:49.146 --> 00:42:51.500
ownership in state lands.
 

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.670
And this created a very
different kind of problem.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:58.702
So, you know that towns get the
majority of their income from

00:42:58.702 --> 00:43:00.130
property taxes.
 

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:04.349
They get some state subsidies
for a variety of purposes,

00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:08.110
including schools,
but also for transportation and

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:10.949
sometimes for medical
facilities.

00:43:10.949 --> 00:43:15.724
But a town such as this town
has the majority of its land in

00:43:15.724 --> 00:43:19.773
public ownership already,
which means that it has a

00:43:19.773 --> 00:43:22.929
highly restricted private tax
base.

00:43:22.929 --> 00:43:28.309
So that the State of New York
pays payments in lieu of taxes,

00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:31.650
but these really are not
comparable to the kind of income

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:35.170
that could be generated if
development were unregulated,

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:37.289
if they were allowed to build
more rapidly.

00:43:37.289 --> 00:43:40.856
Another example of a
conservation strategy is

00:43:40.856 --> 00:43:44.829
demonstrated by this case in the
town of Keene.

00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:49.119
There is a long strip of land
that's privately owned by the

00:43:49.119 --> 00:43:53.483
Sable Club that extends back
perhaps six miles in length and

00:43:53.483 --> 00:43:55.630
maybe a half a mile wide.
 

00:43:55.630 --> 00:44:00.161
And I should have a photo here
that would show you that the

00:44:00.161 --> 00:44:04.300
sides of these lakes go up quite
dramatically into the

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.630
mountainside.
 

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:07.840
It's owned by a private club.
 

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.059
And the private club decided
that they were going to

00:44:10.059 --> 00:44:11.889
self-restrict their development
rights,

00:44:11.889 --> 00:44:15.173
but that they were going to
sell those development rights to

00:44:15.173 --> 00:44:16.510
the State of New York.
 

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.958
So the State of New York did
not take over complete ownership

00:44:18.958 --> 00:44:19.530
of the land.
 

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.530
But remember,
I said that property rights

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.230
might be thought of us a bundle.
 

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:26.760
They sold off the developable
rights to the landscape while

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.380
maintaining the underlying fee
ownership.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.889
So that they were able to do
this in a way that reduced their

00:44:32.889 --> 00:44:33.650
tax burden.
 

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:38.400
The tax burden to this
community was substantial,

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.280
given the hundreds of acres of
lands that they owned,

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.780
so that they were anxious to go
to the town and say,

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.768
"Look, our property value
has been diminished,

00:44:46.768 --> 00:44:49.344
we've given up our development
rights so that our tax base

00:44:49.344 --> 00:44:50.518
should be lowered."
 

00:44:50.518 --> 00:44:53.376
There are a variety of
different instances where the

00:44:53.376 --> 00:44:56.681
nature conservancy throughout
the United States has affected

00:44:56.681 --> 00:44:57.690
this strategy.
 

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:01.121
And it's less expensive than
the state going in and buying up

00:45:01.121 --> 00:45:04.306
all rights to the land,
and it does offer this benefit

00:45:04.306 --> 00:45:07.474
for those that feel like they do
not want to see the area

00:45:07.474 --> 00:45:08.889
developed any further.
 

00:45:08.889 --> 00:45:13.454
So in this debate,
as in many debates,

00:45:13.454 --> 00:45:16.539
who are the key actors?
 

00:45:16.539 --> 00:45:18.739
Who are the stakeholders that
are common?

00:45:18.739 --> 00:45:21.521
Well, there are interesting
tensions between

00:45:21.521 --> 00:45:23.980
conservationists and
environmentalists,

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:27.603
particularly in respect to the
intensity of use of public

00:45:27.603 --> 00:45:28.380
lands.
 

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.559
So that in the Adirondacks,
for example,

00:45:31.559 --> 00:45:33.670
you would have the Adirondack
forty-sixers,

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:37.693
that pride themselves in having
climbed all forty-six peaks in

00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:40.070
excess of 4,000 feet in
elevation.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.159
And then you'd have the
environmentalists.

00:45:42.159 --> 00:45:45.822
And they were often at odds
about what the right way to

00:45:45.822 --> 00:45:48.130
manage public lands ought to be.
 

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:51.306
There are recreational user
groups, as there are surrounding

00:45:51.306 --> 00:45:53.460
all public lands in the United
States.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.130
And these might vary from
cross-country skiers,

00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:00.139
to snowmobilers,
to downhill skiers,

00:46:00.139 --> 00:46:03.018
to timber companies,
to oil companies,

00:46:03.018 --> 00:46:06.278
to those that feel like there
are values associated with those

00:46:06.278 --> 00:46:08.469
public lands that they want
access to,

00:46:08.469 --> 00:46:10.420
that they can make a profit
from.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:13.927
There are tourist corporations
as well that always surround

00:46:13.927 --> 00:46:17.699
these tracts of land,
outfitters in the western part

00:46:17.699 --> 00:46:21.625
of the United States,
horse pack trip offers,

00:46:21.625 --> 00:46:27.128
and another good example might
be what happens with the tour

00:46:27.128 --> 00:46:31.139
boats and the cruise ships up in
Alaska.

00:46:31.139 --> 00:46:35.070
There are also,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:38.157
there are commonly serious
conflicts between permanent

00:46:38.157 --> 00:46:41.829
residents that are more anxious
to see additional development of

00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:44.219
the park and the seasonal
residents,

00:46:44.219 --> 00:46:46.454
that are trying to basically
keep it as undeveloped as

00:46:46.454 --> 00:46:46.920
possible.
 

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.900
And there are tensions among
government agencies.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.893
The agency that existed before
the Adirondack Park Agency was

00:46:52.893 --> 00:46:55.639
the state's Department of
Environmental Conservation.

00:46:55.639 --> 00:47:00.333
And it had authority before the
1973 Act to administer public

00:47:00.333 --> 00:47:00.960
lands.
 

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.842
So if you suddenly give that
authority and policy making

00:47:04.842 --> 00:47:08.090
responsibility to a different
organization,

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:11.128
you're going to have terrific
resentment on the part of the

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:13.329
agency that formerly had that
authority.

00:47:13.329 --> 00:47:16.818
Just like local governments
were resentful about the state

00:47:16.818 --> 00:47:18.409
assumption of authority.
 

00:47:18.409 --> 00:47:22.489
And then you have Native
American claims as well that

00:47:22.489 --> 00:47:27.277
caused conflict in management of
both private and public lands

00:47:27.277 --> 00:47:30.260
and led to litigation in the
park.

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.139
Well, we're at time today.
 

00:47:32.139 --> 00:47:35.427
And I'll pick up on public land
issues and also property rights

00:47:35.427 --> 00:47:38.610
questions with respect to the
Fifth Amendment on Thursday.

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:39.500
Thank you.
 

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:45.000

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.734
Professor Christine
Hayes: I was talking last

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:06.171
time about the concept of
election or choice,

00:00:06.171 --> 00:00:08.830
God's choice of Israel,
Israel as the chosen one,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.430
which occurs for the first time
in the Book of Deuteronomy.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.331
And I was talking about the
fact that for Deuteronomy the

00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:18.002
election of Israel,
God's election of Israel means

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.640
or entails the idea that Israel
is a holy people,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.767
holy in the sense of separated
to God--that root meaning of

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:28.894
holiness which means to be
separated from the common or the

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:31.635
ordinary.
So that separation entails

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:35.196
separation from alien peoples
and practices that are

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:37.990
inconsistent with the worship of
God.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.351
So for this reason,
intermarriage with the

00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:42.770
Canaanites is prohibited in
Deuteronomy.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.415
And, in fact,
they are to be utterly

00:00:44.415 --> 00:00:46.671
destroyed.
All alien practices are to be

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.830
removed from the covenant
community.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.746
Now, given that there were
probably no Canaanites at the

00:00:52.746 --> 00:00:55.310
time of Deuteronomy's
composition,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.928
according to some scholars,
these texts may be understood

00:00:58.928 --> 00:01:02.418
as a kind of internal polemic
against those elements of

00:01:02.418 --> 00:01:05.649
Israelite society whose
practices didn't conform to

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.170
Deuteronomy's Yahweh-only
policy,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.409
or Yahweh-only ideals.
 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.969
This is an idea we will come
back to in a minute.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.769
I just want to throw it out
here.

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:17.379
Separation entails also
separation to God's service.

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.919
That means, of course,
the observance of his laws,

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:22.614
especially the laws of purity,
the rejection of pagan

00:01:22.614 --> 00:01:23.909
practices, and so on.
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.201
So the privilege of having been
chosen or singled out,

00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:30.430
of being a holy people to God
entails obligations and

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.586
responsibility.
At the same time,

00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:35.631
it's interesting that
Deuteronomy seems to be aware of

00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:37.700
some of the dangers in this
idea,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.715
the danger of a superiority
complex, a moral danger involved

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:46.569
in the notion of election.
 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.665
So Deuteronomy warns
repeatedly: it is by no special

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:52.640
virtue or merit that Israel was
the one chosen.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.686
And Moses admonishes the
Israelites not to suppose that

00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:58.959
their inheritance of the land of
Canaan is due to their own

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.735
powers,
or on account of any

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:03.220
righteousness or virtue that
they possess.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.810
In fact, he says, far from it.
 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.228
Israel was chosen by Yahweh in
an act of spontaneous love--;it

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:12.052
does not imply her
perfection--an act of

00:02:12.052 --> 00:02:14.949
spontaneous love for the
patriarchs.

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:19.043
And the election was entirely
God's initiative and is no cause

00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:20.520
for Israel to boast.
 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.689
So Deuteronomy 7,
verses 6-8 read:

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.413
For you are a people
consecrated [made holy]

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:29.303
to the Lord your God:
of all the peoples on earth the

00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:32.360
Lord your God chose you to be
His treasured people.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.059
It is not because you are the
most numerous of peoples that

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.340
the Lord set His heart on you
and chose you --;

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.400
indeed, you are the smallest of
peoples;

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.130
but it was because the Lord
favored you and kept the oath He

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.769
made to your fathers that the
Lord freed you with a mighty

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.129
hand and rescued you from the
house of bondage,

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.520
from the power of Pharaoh king
of Egypt.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.696
So don't be tempted--Moses
later warns the

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:54.882
Israelites--don't be tempted to
say to yourselves (this is in

00:02:54.882 --> 00:02:57.689
Deuteronomy 8:17),
"My own power and the might of

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.530
my own hand have won this wealth
for me," or again,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.720
to say in Deuteronomy 9:4,
"The Lord has enabled us to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.370
possess this land because of our
virtues."

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.652
On the contrary,
he emphasizes,

00:03:07.652 --> 00:03:09.917
it is only because the
wickedness of the Canaanites is

00:03:09.917 --> 00:03:12.439
so great that the Lord has to
drive them from his land,

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.310
and now he is giving you a
chance.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.199
But it is conditional for you,
just as it was for them.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.466
Don't fail him or he will drive
you out just as he drove out the

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.409
Canaanites.
That's a theme in Deuteronomy.

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.764
We are going to see in a moment
how important that is,

00:03:24.764 --> 00:03:27.030
or in a few lectures,
how important that idea is for

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.030
the Deuteronomistic historian in
general.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.349
But we will get there.
 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.401
Another theme in the Book of
Deuteronomy is the theme of

00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:36.287
providential concern,
and that appears in Deuteronomy

00:03:36.287 --> 00:03:38.622
8.
God's providential love and

00:03:38.622 --> 00:03:43.072
care for Israel is expressed
through various metaphors in the

00:03:43.072 --> 00:03:44.690
Bible.
And the prophet Hosea,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.152
who seems to have very strong
connections with the Book of

00:03:47.152 --> 00:03:49.672
Deuteronomy,
the prophet Hosea will develop

00:03:49.672 --> 00:03:53.667
further this image of parent and
child that occurs in Deuteronomy

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:54.496
8.
So in a way,

00:03:54.496 --> 00:03:56.733
the language we were just
referring to was really the

00:03:56.733 --> 00:03:59.152
language of husband and wife,
you know, someone who simply

00:03:59.152 --> 00:04:00.754
loves someone,
not because they are perfect,

00:04:00.754 --> 00:04:01.685
but that is their choice.
 

00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:03.678
They favor them.
They love the person,

00:04:03.678 --> 00:04:05.580
and they make a bond with them.
 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.039
It does not imply anything
about other people.

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.819
It is simply that is the person
who has been the focus.

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.205
So we have a lot of sort of
love and marriage imagery,

00:04:11.205 --> 00:04:13.718
husband and wife imagery,
used for God and Israel,

00:04:13.718 --> 00:04:17.019
but we also have this parent
and child imagery that appears.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.692
In Deuteronomy 32:10,
the image is that of an eagle

00:04:20.692 --> 00:04:23.410
that bears its young on its
wings:

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.910
He found him in a desert
region,

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.240
In an empty howling waste.
 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.759
He engirded him,
watched over him,

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.129
Guarded him as the pupil of his
eye.

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.590
Like an eagle who rouses his
nestlings,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.167
Gliding down to his young,
So did he spread his wings and

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:41.600
take him,
Bear him along on his pinions;

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.819
The Lord alone did guide
him.â€¦

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:47.572
It almost seems to play on the
idea that when teaching its

00:04:47.572 --> 00:04:50.127
young to fly,
the eagle will push them out of

00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:52.909
the nest, swoop under them,
bear them up for awhile over

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:54.730
and over until they get the
idea.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.920
So God is repeatedly testing
and correcting the Israelites

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.439
until they are ready for the
Promised Land.

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:03.774
So Deuteronomy's content,
which are these farewell

00:05:03.774 --> 00:05:07.110
speeches and the death and the
burial of Moses,

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.139
are a fitting capstone to the
Pentateuchal narrative.

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.657
But at the same time,
Deuteronomy really does not

00:05:13.657 --> 00:05:16.568
bring closure to this narrative,
because at the end of

00:05:16.568 --> 00:05:19.310
Deuteronomy, the promises still
are not fulfilled.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.639
The people are still outside
the land.

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.490
Some have suggested that this
is quite purposeful.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.146
It points to an exilic date for
the work's final composition:

00:05:28.146 --> 00:05:30.949
that is to say when it was
finally redacted,

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.387
the redactors were in exile,
writing for a people living in

00:05:35.387 --> 00:05:37.557
exile.
And the Deuteronomist wants to

00:05:37.557 --> 00:05:39.944
make it clear that it is
fidelity to the Torah,

00:05:39.944 --> 00:05:42.591
rather than residence in the
land that is critically

00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:44.400
important.
But in any event,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.490
Deuteronomy is not simply the
concluding book of the

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.519
Pentateuch, or the story that
began in Genesis;

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:53.750
it's also the first part of a
much larger, longer literary

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.788
work, as I mentioned last time,
a work that runs from

00:05:56.788 --> 00:05:59.180
Deuteronomy through to the end
of 2 Kings.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.924
And we are going to consider
today the program and the work

00:06:02.924 --> 00:06:05.699
of this so-called
Deuteronomistic school.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.188
But before we do that,
I wanted to just make a few

00:06:09.188 --> 00:06:13.459
concluding remarks about source
theory and the Pentateuch.

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:16.220
We have talked about the
Documentary Hypothesis.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.111
We have talked about the
different sources that scholars

00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:22.318
believe they have been able to
identify as comprising the five

00:06:22.318 --> 00:06:23.790
books of the Pentateuch.
 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.580
And one of the things I
mentioned a couple of times are

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.629
some of the debates that occur
on the question of dating.

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.549
There is a great deal of
ideological baggage that is

00:06:32.549 --> 00:06:34.839
involved in the dating of the
sources.

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:38.328
One of the issues that I think
is a real problem is the fact

00:06:38.328 --> 00:06:41.461
that the Priestly source,
P, is so often misjudged and

00:06:41.461 --> 00:06:43.848
maligned.
I hope that the little bit of

00:06:43.848 --> 00:06:47.309
time that we have spent on the
Priestly materials gave you some

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:49.653
appreciation of its
transformation of older

00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:53.002
Israelite rituals and traditions
into symbolic practices that

00:06:53.002 --> 00:06:56.240
would communicate basic
convictions about morality,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.329
convictions about holiness.
 

00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:02.174
I hope it gave you a sense of
its communal ethic as opposed to

00:07:02.174 --> 00:07:05.183
an individual morality,
the idea that the actions of

00:07:05.183 --> 00:07:08.000
every individual have an impact
on society as a whole.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.567
But the anti-priest,
anti-cult sentiment,

00:07:10.567 --> 00:07:14.096
of European Protestantism,
is apparent in the history of

00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:17.370
biblical scholarship in the last
few centuries.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.274
And it is apparent in that
scholarship's negative

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:23.240
assessment of the Priestly
source of the Bible.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.774
So for Wellhausen,
the Priestly source,

00:07:25.774 --> 00:07:29.243
which emphasizes cult and
ritual--logically it had to

00:07:29.243 --> 00:07:32.712
represent a late degenerate
stage in the evolution of

00:07:32.712 --> 00:07:36.454
Israelite religion,
because priestly ritualistic

00:07:36.454 --> 00:07:39.639
cultic practices,
these are degenerations.

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:45.801
These are movements away from
true spirit-filled religion in

00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:48.652
his view.
So according to Wellhausen,

00:07:48.652 --> 00:07:51.677
the early period of ancient
Israel must have been

00:07:51.677 --> 00:07:55.605
characterized by a free,
more natural form of religion,

00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:59.982
an intimate relationship with
God, unencumbered or unsullied

00:07:59.982 --> 00:08:04.360
by the legalistic cultic
obsessions of priests and cult.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.355
He argued that in 586,
with the destruction of

00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:11.350
Jerusalem and the people were
taken into exile in Babylon,

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.693
that was when,
in Babylon, the priests were

00:08:14.693 --> 00:08:18.833
able to assume control,
and they were able to play on

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:23.529
the exiles' overwhelming
feelings of guilt and failure.

00:08:23.529 --> 00:08:26.321
The priests were able to
construct a new identity and

00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:29.220
religion that stressed the
sinfulness of the people,

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.847
and the need for ritual purity
and ritual observance and

00:08:31.847 --> 00:08:33.519
legalism as the road back to
God.

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:36.091
And they were able to write
themselves back into the

00:08:36.091 --> 00:08:38.210
narratives and stories of
Israel's past.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.399
And this, according to
Wellhausen, was a degeneration.

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:45.372
Well, this reconstruction of
the evolution of Israelite

00:08:45.372 --> 00:08:49.273
history, Israelite religion,
excuse me, is really driven

00:08:49.273 --> 00:08:52.597
more by theological prejudice
than it is by historical

00:08:52.597 --> 00:08:55.315
evidence.
And it stems from an obvious

00:08:55.315 --> 00:08:58.755
projection of the
Protestant-Catholic tension onto

00:08:58.755 --> 00:09:00.230
Israelite history.
 

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.999
It also is driven very much by
a secessionist account of

00:09:03.999 --> 00:09:07.974
Judaism as being something that
was moribund at the time of

00:09:07.974 --> 00:09:10.328
Jesus.
Jesus came and revived this as

00:09:10.328 --> 00:09:13.330
a spirit-filled religion again,
when it had decayed and

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.778
withered and degenerated like a
dead tree, as Wellhausen refers

00:09:16.778 --> 00:09:19.070
to it.
This isn't to say that all

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.819
scholars who date P to the
post-exilic period are motivated

00:09:22.819 --> 00:09:25.340
by the same problematic
assumptions.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.919
That is certainly not the case.
 

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:30.538
There are scholars of all
stripes and allegiances who view

00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:32.922
P as late;
and there is some very good

00:09:32.922 --> 00:09:36.408
objective evidence for dating
parts of P to the post-exilic

00:09:36.408 --> 00:09:38.691
period,
just as there is good objective

00:09:38.691 --> 00:09:41.836
evidence for dating parts of D
and the other sources to the

00:09:41.836 --> 00:09:43.029
post-exilic period.
 

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:47.165
So when it comes to dating the
sources, certainly I would say

00:09:47.165 --> 00:09:51.093
all scholars agree that the
Priestly materials reach their

00:09:51.093 --> 00:09:54.539
final form in the exile or
post-exilic period.

00:09:54.539 --> 00:09:56.019
So that is the sixth century,
right?

00:09:56.019 --> 00:09:58.532
(You are going to find out,
we are going to return from

00:09:58.532 --> 00:10:00.673
exile in the 530s,
o.k.?) So when we talk about

00:10:00.673 --> 00:10:03.461
the post-exilic period,
we are talking about the period

00:10:03.461 --> 00:10:04.350
after the return.
 

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.775
So the period of the exile is
the sixth century,

00:10:06.775 --> 00:10:09.149
the bulk of the middle of the
sixth century.

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:12.404
So it certainly reached its
final form in that period ,

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:15.176
as did Deuteronomy,
and the Pentateuch probably

00:10:15.176 --> 00:10:16.939
generally.
Nevertheless,

00:10:16.939 --> 00:10:20.406
there are many data that
suggest that the Priestly

00:10:20.406 --> 00:10:24.014
sources retain very early
strata, just as D contains

00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:26.419
pre-exilic or early material.
 

00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:29.982
P espouses a communal ethic,
and post-exilic priests are

00:10:29.982 --> 00:10:33.350
going to turn increasingly to an
individual ethic.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.000
Many sections of P do not seem
to assume a central sanctuary.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.684
Remember that the idea of the
central sanctuary really took

00:10:40.684 --> 00:10:43.669
hold in 622, with Josiah and
Josiah's reform.

00:10:43.669 --> 00:10:46.574
So it becomes a real watershed
for us in dating texts:

00:10:46.574 --> 00:10:49.863
texts that are happy with the
existence of shrines throughout

00:10:49.863 --> 00:10:52.658
the land of Israel are probably
pre-Josiah, pre-622,

00:10:52.658 --> 00:10:55.802
pre-exilic.
Texts that insist on a central

00:10:55.802 --> 00:10:59.269
sanctuary are probably Josiah's
time or later.

00:10:59.269 --> 00:11:02.160
And there are many sections of
P that don't seem to assume a

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.139
central sanctuary.
 

00:11:03.139 --> 00:11:06.333
There are sections of P that do
seem to assume a central

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:08.234
sanctuary.
More significantly,

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:11.720
I think, P contains no
universal ban on intermarriage.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.292
It does not employ its purity
laws or language to mark an

00:11:15.292 --> 00:11:19.120
inseparable boundary between
classes within Israel or between

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.289
Israelites and gentile others.
 

00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:24.673
The use of purity and purity
language to inscribe boundaries

00:11:24.673 --> 00:11:28.171
between Israel and other nations
is very characteristic of the

00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:29.490
post-exilic period.
 

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.470
We are going to see that when
we get there.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.601
So it is very hard to
understand P's silence in this

00:11:34.601 --> 00:11:37.610
regard, if it stems entirely
from the post-exilic,

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:38.899
priestly circles.
 

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:41.852
So I think that instead of
charting an evolution or a

00:11:41.852 --> 00:11:45.088
degeneration--as I have over on
the side of the board- -an

00:11:45.088 --> 00:11:47.360
evolution or a degeneration from
JE,

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.487
the pure spirit-filled
religion, to D,

00:11:49.487 --> 00:11:51.442
the humanitarian,
ethical religion,

00:11:51.442 --> 00:11:53.580
to P,
cultic obsessiveness and

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.022
guilt-ridden legalism,
as is done or implied in some

00:11:57.022 --> 00:12:00.863
classical source theory (some,
not all), it may be better to

00:12:00.863 --> 00:12:03.978
see these three as really
representing three distinct and

00:12:03.978 --> 00:12:07.371
roughly contemporaneous strands
of ancient Israelite tradition

00:12:07.371 --> 00:12:10.320
and experience told from their
own perspectives.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.120
These materials were
transmitted and developed by

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.803
different circles within
Israelite society over

00:12:15.803 --> 00:12:19.070
centuries, and they crystallized
at different times.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.516
JE has fragments that are quite
old, but it probably reached its

00:12:22.516 --> 00:12:25.580
final form before the
centralization of the sanctuary.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.945
It is still comfortable with
the existence of many sacred

00:12:28.945 --> 00:12:32.129
places throughout the land,
so probably before 622.

00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:35.689
Deuteronomy contains northern
traditions from before the fall

00:12:35.689 --> 00:12:39.189
of Israel, which was in 722,
but it was clearly finalized in

00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:41.490
the exile.
There are many passages that

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.639
make it clear that it's written
from an exilic perspective.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:47.251
And the Priestly source,
likewise, contains many,

00:12:47.251 --> 00:12:50.081
many older traditions,
but reached its full and final

00:12:50.081 --> 00:12:52.529
form in the exilic or
post-exilic period.

00:12:52.529 --> 00:12:56.185
So each of these complex,
multi-layered sources--in each

00:12:56.185 --> 00:12:59.509
one of them you can find
different layers--each one

00:12:59.509 --> 00:13:02.680
possesses its own emphases,
its own agenda,

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.309
its own perspectives.
 

00:13:04.309 --> 00:13:06.679
Sometimes they complement one
another.

00:13:06.679 --> 00:13:09.360
Sometimes they challenge and
contradict one another,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.409
but they are not best seen as
linear,

00:13:11.409 --> 00:13:14.069
as telling a neat,
linear story about Israelite

00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:15.919
religion flowering and fading.
 

00:13:15.919 --> 00:13:19.357
Their diversity has not been
flattened or homogenized by the

00:13:19.357 --> 00:13:20.929
final editor of the text.
 

00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:24.436
It has been preserved in a
manner that stimulates

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:26.190
reflection and debate.
 

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.946
So with those concluding
remarks, we are going to move on

00:13:28.946 --> 00:13:31.259
now to the second major section
of the Bible.

00:13:31.259 --> 00:13:33.349
We have been discussing the
Torah, or Pentateuch,

00:13:33.349 --> 00:13:35.917
and now we are moving on to the
section of the Bible that is

00:13:35.917 --> 00:13:37.309
referred to as the Prophets.
 

00:13:37.309 --> 00:13:40.633
This section of the Bible is
divided into two parts we refer

00:13:40.633 --> 00:13:44.070
to as the "Former Prophets" and
then the "Latter Prophets."

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.480
The Former Prophets will
concern us for the next few

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.057
lectures.
And the Former Prophets include

00:13:49.057 --> 00:13:51.911
the books of Joshua,
Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel,

00:13:51.911 --> 00:13:55.074
1 and 2 Kings.
They read as a historical

00:13:55.074 --> 00:13:57.454
narrative.
This material is a

00:13:57.454 --> 00:14:02.236
theologically oriented account
of Israel's history from the

00:14:02.236 --> 00:14:06.392
conquest of Canaan,
or what is represented as the

00:14:06.392 --> 00:14:10.431
conquest of Canaan,
to the destruction of the state

00:14:10.431 --> 00:14:13.419
by the Babylonians in 587-586
BCE.

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:16.419
This material is therefore
crucial background to reading

00:14:16.419 --> 00:14:17.620
the Latter Prophets.
 

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.556
Now the Latter Prophets is a
collection of books,

00:14:20.556 --> 00:14:24.348
each of which bears the name of
the individual whose prophecies

00:14:24.348 --> 00:14:26.000
it purports to contain.
 

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.937
These prophets delivered their
oracles at critical junctures in

00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:33.699
Israel's history,
in the nation's history,

00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:36.822
so their words are only going
to make sense to us if we first

00:14:36.822 --> 00:14:39.737
understand the particular
historical crises that they are

00:14:39.737 --> 00:14:42.269
addressing.
And that historical narrative

00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:46.080
that runs from Joshua through 2
Kings provides that information.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.920
It tells us of the critical
junctures in the nation's

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.307
history, and that will help us
then slot the different prophets

00:14:52.307 --> 00:14:53.707
in.
So the Former Prophets,

00:14:53.707 --> 00:14:55.964
or the historical books,
like the books of the Bible

00:14:55.964 --> 00:14:59.347
that we have already studied,
contain various older sources

00:14:59.347 --> 00:15:02.399
that have been put together by a
later hand.

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:05.774
We have an editor or a group of
editors who reworked these older

00:15:05.774 --> 00:15:07.690
sources.
They were oral traditions.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.250
Some of them were probably from
royal archives and so on.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.881
And they wove them together
into the form that we have now,

00:15:14.881 --> 00:15:18.388
and that is a process that is
referred to as redaction or

00:15:18.388 --> 00:15:20.985
editing.
The anonymous person or group

00:15:20.985 --> 00:15:24.549
or school that's responsible for
the final composition,

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:28.261
the final redaction of these
books, would put the materials

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:32.166
together by inserting verses and
speeches that would frame the

00:15:32.166 --> 00:15:34.789
older sources and link them
together,

00:15:34.789 --> 00:15:37.259
give them some sort of common
uniting thread.

00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:41.091
The redactors' linking and
framing passages and their

00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:45.879
revisions of the older sources
exhibit certain common features.

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:48.029
They harp on the same themes
over and over again;

00:15:48.029 --> 00:15:50.390
they use some of the same
language over and over again;

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.720
they share certain assumptions.
 

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.341
And those features and
assumptions have a lot in common

00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:58.157
with the book of Deuteronomy,
a lot in common with the book

00:15:58.157 --> 00:16:01.511
of Deuteronomy;
and that is what led the German

00:16:01.511 --> 00:16:05.590
scholar, Martin Noth,
to surmise that Deuteronomy and

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.120
these historical books really
form a unit,

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.480
so that Deuteronomy not only
looks back and finishes off the

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.773
Pentateuchal narrative,
it looks forward as the

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:16.697
beginning of really the
historical account that is to

00:16:16.697 --> 00:16:20.162
follow.
J, E and P really seem to come

00:16:20.162 --> 00:16:23.680
to an end here;
there is some debate about

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.545
this, but because the
interpretive history that runs

00:16:27.545 --> 00:16:32.092
from Joshua to 2 Kings is based
on ideals that are set out in

00:16:32.092 --> 00:16:35.945
the book of Deuteronomy,
we refer to the person or the

00:16:35.945 --> 00:16:39.257
persons who redacted this whole
unit as the Deuteronomistic

00:16:39.257 --> 00:16:42.500
historian,
or the Deuteronomistic School.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.393
The whole unit,
as a whole, was redacted after

00:16:45.393 --> 00:16:46.679
622: that's clear.
 

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:50.679
It assumes and insists upon the
centralization of the cult.

00:16:50.679 --> 00:16:54.596
The last dated event that is
mentioned in 2 Kings is

00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:57.129
something that occurred in 562.
 

00:16:57.129 --> 00:17:01.261
That was when King Jehoiachin
was released from prison in

00:17:01.261 --> 00:17:04.229
Babylon, in 562.
So the work was probably

00:17:04.229 --> 00:17:08.327
concluded shortly after that
date: so in exile or towards the

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:10.240
end of the exilic period.
 

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.170
Martin Noth assumed that there
was one editor.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.638
Other scholars have assumed
that there were two,

00:17:14.638 --> 00:17:16.738
or even more,
successive editions of this

00:17:16.738 --> 00:17:19.679
history because there are
multiple perspectives that seem

00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:20.940
to be represented.
 

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.240
But the last seems to be an
exilic perspective,

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.089
the perspective of someone
sitting in exile and we will be

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:28.190
returning to that in a future
lecture.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.806
Some of the books within this
very large unit,

00:17:30.806 --> 00:17:34.119
or at least the traditions
within this very large unit,

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:38.039
are less influenced by
Deuteronomy and its themes and

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:40.858
its concerns.
Some contain clearly

00:17:40.858 --> 00:17:45.670
pre-Deuteronomistic elements and
materials, if you will.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.282
But I encourage you to read the
excellent introduction to the

00:17:48.282 --> 00:17:50.807
Prophets, the section of the
Bible "The Prophets" which was

00:17:50.807 --> 00:17:53.549
written by Marc Brettler in your
Jewish Study Bible.

00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:56.335
I think it is an excellent
introduction to the complexity

00:17:56.335 --> 00:17:57.279
of this material.
 

00:17:57.279 --> 00:18:00.941
The most salient feature of the
Deuteronomistic School is the

00:18:00.941 --> 00:18:03.993
conviction that Israel's
residence in the land is a

00:18:03.993 --> 00:18:07.411
function of its obedience or
disobedience to the covenant

00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:10.689
with Yahweh.
And that conviction is going to

00:18:10.689 --> 00:18:13.853
color its presentation,
its evaluation and its

00:18:13.853 --> 00:18:17.508
interpretation of Israel's
history and her kings from

00:18:17.508 --> 00:18:20.109
Joshua right through to 2 Kings.
 

00:18:20.109 --> 00:18:23.739
Yehezkel Kaufmann uses the term
"historiosophy" which I have

00:18:23.739 --> 00:18:25.584
written up here,
historiosophy,

00:18:25.584 --> 00:18:27.430
to describe this material.
 

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:30.417
Where a historian might simply
record events (as if that is

00:18:30.417 --> 00:18:33.634
such a simple thing to do,
but let's go with that for a

00:18:33.634 --> 00:18:36.740
moment)--a historian might
simply record events,

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.857
however selectively or
partially, might try to indicate

00:18:39.857 --> 00:18:43.957
cause and effect where possible;
but a historiosophy is a more

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:46.390
conscious philosophy of history.
 

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:50.755
It's seeking to ascertain the
meaning of events to draw larger

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.720
philosophical,
ideological conclusions from

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.839
the events of history,
and to point to the larger

00:18:56.839 --> 00:19:00.711
purpose or design of history,
not to say just what happened,

00:19:00.711 --> 00:19:04.354
but to say why it happened and
what it means for us today that

00:19:04.354 --> 00:19:07.123
it did happen.
So the Deuteronomistic history

00:19:07.123 --> 00:19:10.455
is not simply a history of
Israel until the destruction of

00:19:10.455 --> 00:19:12.559
Jerusalem, it is a
historiosophy.

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:16.508
It is making an argument and
it's attempting to communicate

00:19:16.508 --> 00:19:20.730
the meaning and the significance
of the events of that time,

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:24.130
and it does so through a
pattern, a literary pattern we

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.460
will see, of reward and
punishment.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.030
This is an important point,
and as we begin to go through

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.050
the material,
we will be coming back to this.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.519
We will return to this idea.
 

00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:36.837
There are certain key features
of Deuteronomistic thought that

00:19:36.837 --> 00:19:39.809
are evident from Joshua through
2 Kings.

00:19:39.809 --> 00:19:43.250
One is the belief in the divine
election of Jerusalem.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.706
Jerusalem is the city that is
referred to in Deuteronomy when

00:19:46.706 --> 00:19:50.220
it says God will choose a place
to cause his name to dwell.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.018
In the Deuteronomistic books,
that place is going to be

00:19:53.018 --> 00:19:55.847
Jerusalem.
There is also a belief in the

00:19:55.847 --> 00:20:00.720
divine election of David as the
king of Israel and his dynasty.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.451
Now, it's interesting because
the other four books of the

00:20:03.451 --> 00:20:05.109
Pentateuch never mention a king.
 

00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:08.693
In Genesis through Numbers none
of the legal materials say:

00:20:08.693 --> 00:20:11.660
when you have a king this is
what he shall do.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.481
It is only the book of
Deuteronomy that assumes or

00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:17.879
prepares for a monarchy and
contains legislation for a king,

00:20:17.879 --> 00:20:20.009
and the things that he should
do.

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:21.956
So this, again,
underscores the connection

00:20:21.956 --> 00:20:23.998
between Deuteronomy and the
following books.

00:20:23.998 --> 00:20:25.470
Deuteronomy assumes a king.
 

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.510
It is being written and
redacted at a time when there is

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.031
a king in Israel,
there have been kings in

00:20:29.031 --> 00:20:31.918
Israel,
and it is providing laws for

00:20:31.918 --> 00:20:35.369
the construction of an ideal
monarchy.

00:20:35.369 --> 00:20:39.414
So David, the theme of David as
the elected king of God,

00:20:39.414 --> 00:20:43.531
David also as the ideal king,
is something else that is a

00:20:43.531 --> 00:20:45.369
theme of these books.
 

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:49.343
Another theme that we see in
these books or feature of the

00:20:49.343 --> 00:20:53.316
Deuteronomistic School is the
emphasis on what we call the

00:20:53.316 --> 00:20:57.220
Yahwist prophets -- prophets
like Elijah and Elisha.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.339
 
 

00:21:00.339 --> 00:21:04.521
These prophets are held up as
heroes and champions of

00:21:04.521 --> 00:21:06.049
religious purity.
 

00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:09.160
They are completely against any
kind of mixture of Yahweh

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.160
worship with other elements,
any kind of syncretism.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.360
The other thing we see in the
Deuteronomistic material is a

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.774
preference for Judah,
the Southern Kingdom,

00:21:17.774 --> 00:21:20.554
as compared with a very
negative presentation of the

00:21:20.554 --> 00:21:22.079
Northern Kingdom,
Israel.

00:21:22.079 --> 00:21:24.444
The Northern Kingdom Israel is
going to come in for very,

00:21:24.444 --> 00:21:27.019
very bad press at the hands of
the Deuteronomistic writers,

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:32.160
which shows that they probably
favor or come from Judah.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.779
So the northern kings are going
to be uniformly denigrated.

00:21:35.779 --> 00:21:38.894
They are going to be denigrated
because they maintain cults that

00:21:38.894 --> 00:21:41.019
rival the central sanctuary of
Jerusalem.

00:21:41.019 --> 00:21:42.819
And this is going to be what
does them in.

00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:45.650
The other theme that we see
throughout the Deuteronomistic

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.529
material is the negative
presentation of the Canaanites.

00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:51.695
But we will talk more about who
these Canaanites were and how

00:21:51.695 --> 00:21:54.069
complicated, in fact,
that presentation is.

00:21:54.069 --> 00:21:57.006
Now, the books of Joshua and
Judges that open the

00:21:57.006 --> 00:22:00.249
Deuteronomistic history,
these books recount or relate

00:22:00.249 --> 00:22:04.104
the story of the conquest of the
land of Canaan by the Israelite

00:22:04.104 --> 00:22:06.817
tribes,
and the early years of the

00:22:06.817 --> 00:22:09.029
settlement: that's in Judges.
 

00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:11.588
To gain an understanding of
some of the issues involved,

00:22:11.588 --> 00:22:14.099
and the emergence of a tribal
structure in the land,

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:16.996
it's helpful to know something
about the geography of Israel,

00:22:16.996 --> 00:22:19.845
which is why I have handed out
for you a couple of different

00:22:19.845 --> 00:22:22.224
maps,
but one that gives you physical

00:22:22.224 --> 00:22:24.420
features (and that is on the
top).

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:29.249
It has often been pointed out
that in the past 4000 years more

00:22:29.249 --> 00:22:34.000
wars have been fought for the
possession of the tiny strip of

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.313
land known as Canaan,
or the land of Israel,

00:22:37.313 --> 00:22:39.616
or Palestine,
than have been fought for

00:22:39.616 --> 00:22:41.920
almost any other area in the
world.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.296
And in the ancient world,
the reason for this was that

00:22:45.296 --> 00:22:49.054
this very small rectangle--;it's
about 150 miles long and 70

00:22:49.054 --> 00:22:51.606
miles wide,
about the size of Rhode

00:22:51.606 --> 00:22:55.147
Island--this very small
rectangle lies on the way to

00:22:55.147 --> 00:22:58.550
anywhere worth going in the
Ancient Near East.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.490
You've got Egypt over here.
 

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:04.589
You've got Asia Minor up here,
and you've got Mesopotamia over

00:23:04.589 --> 00:23:06.277
here.
Not a tremendous amount of

00:23:06.277 --> 00:23:09.086
inherent value in this strip of
land, but it is important for

00:23:09.086 --> 00:23:11.240
where you could go by traveling
through it.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.241
So you have three main trade
routes that cross the country,

00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:17.295
and they were used by trading
caravans that would carry gold

00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:20.193
and grain and spices and
textiles and other goods between

00:23:20.193 --> 00:23:22.936
Egypt and the rest of the
Fertile Crescent and up into

00:23:22.936 --> 00:23:24.874
Asia Minor.
So control of these

00:23:24.874 --> 00:23:27.838
international highways brought a
great deal of wealth to the

00:23:27.838 --> 00:23:30.133
area,
but the central location was a

00:23:30.133 --> 00:23:33.099
double-edged sword,
because in times of peace it

00:23:33.099 --> 00:23:35.723
would bring prosperity,
but, of course,

00:23:35.723 --> 00:23:39.459
in times of war the land was
perpetually invaded as armies

00:23:39.459 --> 00:23:43.523
would crisscross the land going
off to do battle with the great

00:23:43.523 --> 00:23:46.344
powers.
So on their way to conquests in

00:23:46.344 --> 00:23:49.887
Egypt, or Asia Minor or
Mesopotamia, armies would tramp

00:23:49.887 --> 00:23:51.200
through the land.
 

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.162
And that explains the
succession of rulers that have

00:23:54.162 --> 00:23:56.079
held the region:
the Egyptians,

00:23:56.079 --> 00:23:57.752
the Amorites,
the Israelites,

00:23:57.752 --> 00:23:59.544
the Assyrians,
the Babylonians,

00:23:59.544 --> 00:24:01.823
the Persians,
the Greeks, the Greek

00:24:01.823 --> 00:24:04.770
Ptolemies, the Seleucids,
the Romans, and the list

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.740
continues as we go on into the
medieval and the modern periods.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:13.009
Now, despite the fact that this
is a very small piece of land,

00:24:13.009 --> 00:24:15.880
it boasts great geographical
diversity.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.119
So there are three main
geographical subdivisions.

00:24:18.119 --> 00:24:21.440
You can see them on your map,
and they really run in strips

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.700
from north to south.
 

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.175
If you look at your map you
will see first on the west side,

00:24:25.175 --> 00:24:26.560
you've got a low coastal plain.
 

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.420
It is about 20 or 30 miles wide.
 

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.162
It is the coastal plain,
and that provides,

00:24:31.162 --> 00:24:35.079
or that is the main highway out
of Egypt or down to Egypt.

00:24:35.079 --> 00:24:39.306
That area was controlled by
Egypt at the purported time of

00:24:39.306 --> 00:24:41.979
the Exodus.
Running north to south,

00:24:41.979 --> 00:24:46.289
next to that coastal plain,
is a region of low mountains.

00:24:46.289 --> 00:24:49.838
These low mountains are cut by
some valleys that sort of run

00:24:49.838 --> 00:24:53.207
east-west: you will see one
there, the Valley of Jezreel,

00:24:53.207 --> 00:24:55.911
in particular;
that was a particularly fertile

00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:58.190
valley.
So the valleys that cut through

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.410
the mountains are extremely
fertile.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.700
The Plain of Megiddo also joins
with the Valley of Jezreel.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.130
That is the most fertile part
of the country,

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.334
but it was also the site of
many of the most bloody battles

00:25:09.334 --> 00:25:10.660
in Israel's history.
 

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.615
Then next to that north-south
central hill country,

00:25:13.615 --> 00:25:17.220
you've got also running north
to south, what we call the Great

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.579
Jordan Rift Valley.
 

00:25:18.579 --> 00:25:21.019
It goes the entire length of
the country.

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:23.670
And the Jordan River runs
through this valley.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:27.307
It rises in the Sea of Galilee
or the Kinneret in the north,

00:25:27.307 --> 00:25:29.958
and then it flows about 65
miles, I believe,

00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:31.500
down to the Dead Sea.
 

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:36.266
At the northern extreme of the
Rift Valley, is Mount Hermon,

00:25:36.266 --> 00:25:38.609
which is the highest point.
 

00:25:38.609 --> 00:25:41.259
It is snow covered,
Mount Hermon.

00:25:41.259 --> 00:25:45.290
And that is the highest point
in Israel, it rises about 10,000

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:46.809
feet above sea level.
 

00:25:46.809 --> 00:25:50.259
The central mountain area,
those are between 4000 and

00:25:50.259 --> 00:25:52.250
10,000 feet above sea level.
 

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.796
As you move from the central
area over to

00:25:54.796 --> 00:25:58.616
Jerusalem--Jerusalem is about
2,500 feet above sea level--but

00:25:58.616 --> 00:26:02.500
then as you continue moving east
towards the Rift Valley,

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.878
that area is dramatically lower
-- and you feel it as you travel

00:26:06.878 --> 00:26:09.546
the road there,
just how quickly it drops,

00:26:09.546 --> 00:26:12.977
so that by the time you get to
the Sea of Galilee you are 700

00:26:12.977 --> 00:26:16.438
feet below sea level,
and the Dead Sea is nearly 1300

00:26:16.438 --> 00:26:17.920
feet below sea level.
 

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.984
That is the lowest point on the
earth's land surface--so this

00:26:21.984 --> 00:26:25.710
dramatic drop in just a very
short geographical area.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.773
Up in the north,
the river is surrounded by very

00:26:28.773 --> 00:26:32.619
lush vegetation on both sides,
but there is no life 65 miles

00:26:32.619 --> 00:26:34.640
south down by the Dead Sea.
 

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.813
This is because the water is
25% salts and minerals--although

00:26:37.813 --> 00:26:41.039
I hear they found some sort of
bacteria or something there,

00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:43.206
so I guess I should not say
anymore that there is no

00:26:43.206 --> 00:26:45.755
life--but essentially there is
no life we would care about in

00:26:45.755 --> 00:26:46.690
the Dead Sea area.
 

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.349
So it is a very desolate area.
 

00:26:48.349 --> 00:26:51.720
And tradition identifies this
as the site of Sodom and

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.831
Gomorrah.
The area around the Sea is

00:26:53.831 --> 00:26:55.079
basically semi-desert.
 

00:26:55.079 --> 00:26:58.750
We call this the wilderness,
the wilderness of Judea between

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:02.047
Jerusalem and the Dead Sea,
the wilderness of Judah or

00:27:02.047 --> 00:27:04.708
Judea.
So within this relatively tiny

00:27:04.708 --> 00:27:08.716
area there are radically diverse
regions, and this fact held

00:27:08.716 --> 00:27:11.910
important implications for
Israel's history.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.039
Unity was difficult.
 

00:27:14.039 --> 00:27:17.805
Being somewhat isolated,
the inhabitants of each region

00:27:17.805 --> 00:27:21.849
developed a distinctive economic
and cultural character.

00:27:21.849 --> 00:27:24.597
You have the small settled
farmer in the more fertile

00:27:24.597 --> 00:27:26.800
areas.
You have semi-nomadic shepherds.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.220
You have city dwellers.
 

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.676
You have merchants and traders
who are handling the commerce on

00:27:31.676 --> 00:27:34.910
the trade routes and enjoying
broader cultural contacts.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:38.016
So that's the geographical
setting for what we are about to

00:27:38.016 --> 00:27:39.569
read in the Book of Joshua.
 

00:27:39.569 --> 00:27:42.000
The structure of Joshua is
really somewhat simple.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.569
We can really divide it into
two major parts.

00:27:44.569 --> 00:27:49.496
The first 12 chapters form a
unit that conveys the invasion

00:27:49.496 --> 00:27:52.032
and conquest.
There are certain important

00:27:52.032 --> 00:27:54.211
elements.
In chapter 2 we have Joshua

00:27:54.211 --> 00:27:56.809
sending out spies to scout out
the land.

00:27:56.809 --> 00:27:59.814
In chapter 3 we have the
account of crossing the Jordan

00:27:59.814 --> 00:28:02.329
River.
In chapter 6 we have the Battle

00:28:02.329 --> 00:28:04.599
of Jericho.
The story of the Battle of

00:28:04.599 --> 00:28:07.935
Jericho is really a composite of
two accounts that have been

00:28:07.935 --> 00:28:10.309
woven together into a single
narrative.

00:28:10.309 --> 00:28:13.946
So in one of them Joshua's
warriors seem to march silently

00:28:13.946 --> 00:28:15.859
around the city seven times.
 

00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:18.789
In another, the priests carry
the Ark around the city 13

00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:22.038
times, so scholars think there
are two different accounts here

00:28:22.038 --> 00:28:25.109
woven together.
Chapter 8 describes the victory

00:28:25.109 --> 00:28:28.099
at a place called Ai,
which is near Jericho.

00:28:28.099 --> 00:28:32.621
Chapter 9 tells the story of
the Gibeonites who join the

00:28:32.621 --> 00:28:35.987
Israelites;
they are a local group that

00:28:35.987 --> 00:28:37.690
seems to join them.
 

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:43.160
And then 10 and 11 give us two
further military campaigns.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.990
Towards the end of 11,
we have summary statements.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:51.275
In Joshua 10:40,
we read: "So Joshua defeated

00:28:51.275 --> 00:28:54.187
the whole land,
the hill country and the

00:28:54.187 --> 00:28:58.219
Negeb"--;that's the desert here
to the south--;"and the

00:28:58.219 --> 00:29:01.579
lowland"--so you have the hill
country,

00:29:01.579 --> 00:29:04.049
the low land--;"and the slopes,
and all their kings;

00:29:04.049 --> 00:29:07.262
he left none remaining,
but utterly destroyed all that

00:29:07.262 --> 00:29:09.308
breathed".
Chapter 11 goes on to stress

00:29:09.308 --> 00:29:12.180
that Joshua completed the task
that had been begun by Moses.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.887
In verse 15:
"Just as the Lord had commanded

00:29:14.887 --> 00:29:17.784
His servant Moses,
so Moses had charged Joshua,

00:29:17.784 --> 00:29:20.869
and so Joshua did;
he left nothing undone of all

00:29:20.869 --> 00:29:22.980
that the Lord had commanded
Moses."

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.221
And again, in verse 23,
the insistence:

00:29:25.221 --> 00:29:27.580
"Thus Joshua conquered the
whole country,

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.940
just as the Lord had promised
Moses;

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.096
and Joshua assigned it to
Israel to share according to

00:29:33.096 --> 00:29:36.014
their tribal divisions,
and the land had rest from

00:29:36.014 --> 00:29:38.123
war."
So Chapters 13 and 21 go on to

00:29:38.123 --> 00:29:41.166
describe the division of the
land among the tribes and then

00:29:41.166 --> 00:29:43.579
we have some sort of tidying up
at the end.

00:29:43.579 --> 00:29:47.297
The remaining chapters are
appendices: 23 is a farewell

00:29:47.297 --> 00:29:51.289
address, and 24 is a renewal of
the covenant at Shechem,

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:54.329
which brings everything to a
nice conclusion.

00:29:54.329 --> 00:29:57.257
So the narrative in the first
part of Joshua,

00:29:57.257 --> 00:29:59.718
Joshua 2 to 12,
describes the invading

00:29:59.718 --> 00:30:03.577
Israelites as an organized
confederation of 12 tribes whose

00:30:03.577 --> 00:30:07.502
conquest is accomplished in a
few decisive battles under the

00:30:07.502 --> 00:30:10.029
military leadership of Joshua.
 

00:30:10.029 --> 00:30:13.126
And the disunited Canaanites
put up little or no resistance:

00:30:13.126 --> 00:30:15.750
they're paralyzed by a fear
that is sent by God.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:18.684
All of those who were conquered
are put to the ban or the

00:30:18.684 --> 00:30:21.933
herem--that's the sacred
devotion of objects and persons

00:30:21.933 --> 00:30:24.031
to God,
which entailed killing them,

00:30:24.031 --> 00:30:25.769
so they were utterly destroyed.
 

00:30:25.769 --> 00:30:28.791
So the first half of the book
of Joshua contains a

00:30:28.791 --> 00:30:31.998
streamlined, idealized account
according to which the

00:30:31.998 --> 00:30:35.328
Israelites managed in a
relatively short period to take

00:30:35.328 --> 00:30:39.220
the central hill country,
confining the Philistines to a

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.859
little strip here on the coastal
plain.

00:30:41.859 --> 00:30:45.019
We will come to the Philistines
in a minute.

00:30:45.019 --> 00:30:48.331
The account of the conquest in
Joshua 2 through 12,

00:30:48.331 --> 00:30:51.708
is concerned to express the
basic idea that Israel's

00:30:51.708 --> 00:30:55.550
victories would not have been
possible without Yahweh,

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:56.950
without his wondrous help.
 

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:00.049
It was Yahweh who divided the
Jordan before them.

00:31:00.049 --> 00:31:02.559
It was Yahweh who broke down
the walls of Jericho.

00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:05.849
It was Yahweh who put fear in
the hearts of the Canaanites.

00:31:05.849 --> 00:31:07.619
Yahweh was present at every
battle.

00:31:07.619 --> 00:31:10.587
The Ark was a visible sign of
his presence and it marched

00:31:10.587 --> 00:31:12.925
before them.
And soon after the conquest

00:31:12.925 --> 00:31:16.354
representatives of all of the
tribes of Israel are going to

00:31:16.354 --> 00:31:19.960
meet and make a solemn covenant
at Shechem to be the people of

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.970
Yahweh, to worship him alone.
 

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.376
And according to the Book of
Joshua, Israel's tribal

00:31:25.376 --> 00:31:28.849
structure assumed its classical
form at this time.

00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:33.186
This is a very neat picture of
the rapid conquest of Canaan,

00:31:33.186 --> 00:31:36.934
but it's at odds with
statements elsewhere in Joshua

00:31:36.934 --> 00:31:39.140
and in the book of Judges.
 

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.128
For example,
the victories in Chapters 2

00:31:42.128 --> 00:31:45.730
through 10 are confined to a
very small area,

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.990
what would actually be the
tribe of Benjamin basically,

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.500
so just one small area.
 

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.459
In Joshua 13:1:
Joshua 13 opens with the

00:31:53.459 --> 00:31:57.101
statement that Joshua was old,
advanced in years,

00:31:57.101 --> 00:32:01.730
and there was much of the land
remaining to be possessed.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:05.971
In Joshua 10 (which is in the
first part of Joshua--Joshua 10)

00:32:05.971 --> 00:32:10.560
verses 36-39 report the conquest
of several cities in the south,

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.380
including Hebron and Debir.
 

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.622
But in Judges,
we read that they had not been

00:32:15.622 --> 00:32:18.630
captured: they were captured
later, after Joshua's death.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:22.369
Joshua 12:10 reports the defeat
of the king of Jerusalem.

00:32:22.369 --> 00:32:25.797
In Judges 1:8 and 21,
we read that the people of

00:32:25.797 --> 00:32:29.880
Judah did this (conquered the
king of Jerusalem) and that

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:34.037
despite that victory they failed
to actually drive out the

00:32:34.037 --> 00:32:37.130
inhabitants,
the Jebusites, who lived there.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.561
And it is not until King David,
200 years later that,

00:32:40.561 --> 00:32:44.190
in fact, we will read about the
capture of Jerusalem.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:48.656
Judges 1 gives a long list of
the places from which the

00:32:48.656 --> 00:32:51.220
Canaanites were not expelled.
 

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.588
Also archaeological evidence
contradicts the picture in

00:32:54.588 --> 00:32:56.405
Joshua.
In the Ancient Near East,

00:32:56.405 --> 00:32:59.269
destroyed cities tended to be
leveled, and then a new city

00:32:59.269 --> 00:33:01.430
would just be built on top of
the ruins,

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.799
and you would have these slowly
rising mounds--each one of those

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:08.170
is called a tell (so you
may have heard of Tell Dor?).

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.240
These are mounds which
represent the successive layers

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.210
of destroyed and rebuilt cities.
 

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:17.565
And excavations will reveal the
destruction layers under the

00:33:17.565 --> 00:33:19.190
floor of new cities.
 

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.607
So following the biblical
account, we would expect

00:33:22.607 --> 00:33:27.279
evidence of a thirteenth century
destruction of Canaanite cities.

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:29.787
And archaeologists for a long
time were convinced that they

00:33:29.787 --> 00:33:31.430
would find these destruction
layers.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.369
But they were disappointed.
 

00:33:33.369 --> 00:33:37.121
They have found really no
evidence of extensive conquest

00:33:37.121 --> 00:33:40.396
and destruction in thirteenth
and twelfth century

00:33:40.396 --> 00:33:42.170
archaeological layers.
 

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.627
Some of the sites that are said
to be destroyed by Joshua and

00:33:45.627 --> 00:33:48.740
the Israelites weren't even
occupied in this period,

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.740
the late Bronze Age,
beginning of the Iron Age;

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.900
the Iron Age begins around 1200.
 

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.682
Excavations at Jericho and Ai
indicate that both of these

00:33:56.682 --> 00:34:00.666
towns were laid waste at least
200 years before the probable

00:34:00.666 --> 00:34:04.019
time of Joshua;
so there weren't even any walls

00:34:04.019 --> 00:34:06.289
in Jericho at the time of
Joshua.

00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:09.743
Of 20 identifiable sites that
were said to be conquered or

00:34:09.743 --> 00:34:12.530
captured by Joshua and the next
generations,

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:16.670
only two show destruction
layers for this time,

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.469
Hazor and Beth-el.
 

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:20.820
And yet interestingly enough,
Hazor's capture described in

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.800
Joshua is contradicted elsewhere
in the Bible,

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.440
because in Judges 4 and 5,
it is still a Canaanite city.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.937
It is said there that it is
still a Canaanite city and

00:34:27.937 --> 00:34:29.210
Joshua failed to take it.
 

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:33.410
So the conclusion one can draw
from all of this is that Joshua

00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:37.059
2 through 12 is a kind of
ideological construction,

00:34:37.059 --> 00:34:40.494
the significance and the
purpose of which we will come

00:34:40.494 --> 00:34:41.920
back to in a moment.
 

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.603
But clearly the formation of
the nation state,

00:34:44.603 --> 00:34:47.525
Israel, was much more
complicated than the picture

00:34:47.525 --> 00:34:50.150
that's presented in Joshua 2
through 12.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:54.166
Scholars have proposed three
possible models to explain the

00:34:54.166 --> 00:34:55.690
formation of Israel.
 

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.159
The first is an immigration
model.

00:34:58.159 --> 00:34:59.850
This was first posed by German
scholars.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:04.030
 
 

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:08.039
Since the main Canaanite cities
that existed in the land at that

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:11.730
time were fortified or walled
cities down on the plains,

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.016
the Israelites,
it's thought according to this

00:35:14.016 --> 00:35:16.912
model, would have entered and
they would have occupied the

00:35:16.912 --> 00:35:19.250
very sparsely populated central
highlands.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.795
They would slowly have begun to
take control of the plains

00:35:21.795 --> 00:35:23.269
coming down from the highlands.
 

00:35:23.269 --> 00:35:26.225
Well, we do know that at the
end of the late Bronze Age,

00:35:26.225 --> 00:35:28.378
beginning of the Iron Age,
around 1200,

00:35:28.378 --> 00:35:30.917
this was a time of great
upheaval throughout the

00:35:30.917 --> 00:35:32.159
Mediterranean world.
 

00:35:32.159 --> 00:35:34.520
We have the collapse of
Mycenaean civilization.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.219
We have the Trojan Wars.
 

00:35:36.219 --> 00:35:40.551
The Hittites are invading Asia
Minor, modern day Turkey to the

00:35:40.551 --> 00:35:43.124
north.
And these upheavals are leading

00:35:43.124 --> 00:35:45.840
to mass migrations,
migrations of people.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.634
Many are sailing from mainland
Greece and from the Greek

00:35:48.634 --> 00:35:50.820
Islands, and they are flooding
this area,

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.380
the coasts of Phoenicia,
the coasts of Canaan and Egypt.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.687
And these people are spoken
about in a lot of our ancient

00:35:56.687 --> 00:35:58.473
sources.
They are referred to as

00:35:58.473 --> 00:36:01.100
"peoples of the sea," coming in
from the sea,

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.025
from islands and coastal areas
of the northeastern

00:36:04.025 --> 00:36:07.428
Mediterranean.
One of these peoples of the

00:36:07.428 --> 00:36:11.461
sea, one of these groups,
inhabited an area here:

00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:13.309
Perasta or Pelasta.
 

00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:15.881
The word "Palestine" comes from
this, Peresta,

00:36:15.881 --> 00:36:17.310
Palesta or Philistines.
 

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:19.420
It is all the same root.
 

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.129
And so a group if these sea
peoples comes in and occupies

00:36:22.129 --> 00:36:24.230
this area.
They will be the Philistines,

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.170
the area that is now the Gaza
Strip.

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:29.600
And they found the five
Philistine cities that you will

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.458
hear about increasingly in the
book of Judges:

00:36:32.458 --> 00:36:35.190
Gaza, Ashkelon,
Gath, Ashdod and Ekron.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.821
The idea of the immigration
model is that Hebrew settlement

00:36:38.821 --> 00:36:42.390
would have probably occurred at
about the same time in the

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:45.019
latter part of the thirteenth
century.

00:36:45.019 --> 00:36:47.751
The Hebrews could take
advantage of all of these

00:36:47.751 --> 00:36:50.250
upheavals and the weakened hold
of Egypt.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.759
Remember Egypt had control of
this area but their grasp was

00:36:53.759 --> 00:36:57.147
weakening with the flood of
people coming in from the sea

00:36:57.147 --> 00:36:58.659
and other migrations.
 

00:36:58.659 --> 00:37:02.029
Their hold was weakening and
the Hebrews would have been able

00:37:02.029 --> 00:37:05.454
to take advantage of that and
enter in and occupy areas in the

00:37:05.454 --> 00:37:06.690
central highlands.
 

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.179
The problem with the
immigration model,

00:37:09.179 --> 00:37:11.670
again, is the archaeological
record.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:14.170
Archaeologists have,
indeed, found several sites in

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.969
the central hill country --
which is pretty exciting--and

00:37:16.969 --> 00:37:19.619
they were clearly newly
established in the thirteenth,

00:37:19.619 --> 00:37:21.320
twelfth, eleventh centuries.
 

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.453
So clearly something new was
happening in the central

00:37:24.453 --> 00:37:25.960
highlands at this time.
 

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.259
They extend throughout the
land, but mostly the central

00:37:28.259 --> 00:37:30.357
highlands.
And these are thought to be

00:37:30.357 --> 00:37:33.824
Israelite, especially because
they appear in places that the

00:37:33.824 --> 00:37:36.469
Bible identifies as strongholds
of Israel.

00:37:36.469 --> 00:37:39.385
Remember also,
you have the Merneptah stele of

00:37:39.385 --> 00:37:43.079
1204, in which the Egyptian
pharaoh boasts that he managed

00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:44.570
to wipe out Israel.
 

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:48.930
It is obviously a hyperbolic
boast, but the point is it shows

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.927
that there was an identifiable
entity, Israel in Canaan,

00:37:52.927 --> 00:37:55.870
by 1204.
These new thirteenth century

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:59.789
settlements, however,
are in their material culture,

00:37:59.789 --> 00:38:03.772
that is to say their pots and
their jars and their houses,

00:38:03.772 --> 00:38:05.239
entirely Canaanite.
 

00:38:05.239 --> 00:38:08.253
The inhabitants seem to have
been peasant farmers,

00:38:08.253 --> 00:38:09.730
like other Canaanites.
 

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:13.007
One interesting difference is
the absence of any pig bones,

00:38:13.007 --> 00:38:14.760
which is kind of interesting.
 

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.057
But in any event,
this suggests that these

00:38:17.057 --> 00:38:20.084
settlements were established
peacefully, not by a group

00:38:20.084 --> 00:38:21.710
coming in and conquering.
 

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:26.252
Maybe they emerged from within,
rather than being established

00:38:26.252 --> 00:38:29.130
by peoples immigrating from
without.

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:32.315
So there are two other models,
then, models different from the

00:38:32.315 --> 00:38:34.593
immigration model,
two other models for

00:38:34.593 --> 00:38:38.045
understanding the formation of
Israel, that build on this

00:38:38.045 --> 00:38:39.710
archaeological evidence.
 

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:44.469
The second model is what we
call the revolt model.

00:38:44.469 --> 00:38:49.079
The revolt model proposes that
Israel began really as a social

00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:51.120
revolution within Canaan.
 

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.110
We do have a set of letters.
 

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:56.119
These are letters that date
from the fourteenth century BCE.

00:38:56.119 --> 00:38:59.330
They were written by people in
Canaan to the Pharaoh in

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:02.837
Egypt--remember the Pharaoh
still has control over Canaan at

00:39:02.837 --> 00:39:05.436
this time.
And in these letters there are

00:39:05.436 --> 00:39:08.911
lots of complaints about groups
that are causing turmoil and

00:39:08.911 --> 00:39:11.487
upset in Canaan.
They are challenging Egypt's

00:39:11.487 --> 00:39:13.989
rule.
And these people are called

00:39:13.989 --> 00:39:15.449
Habiru, or Abiru.
 

00:39:15.449 --> 00:39:20.405
They were not an ethnic group
so much as a marginal social

00:39:20.405 --> 00:39:23.969
group of people in revolt,
if you will.

00:39:23.969 --> 00:39:27.936
Some have suggested that
Israelites escaping from Egypt

00:39:27.936 --> 00:39:31.682
may have joined with these
disaffected Canaanites in

00:39:31.682 --> 00:39:33.472
revolt,
known as Habiru,

00:39:33.472 --> 00:39:36.114
these trouble makers,
to establish their own

00:39:36.114 --> 00:39:38.940
settlements and to worship a
liberator god,

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:43.460
Yahweh, rather than follow the
rule of Pharaoh.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.915
A final model,
then, is a model of gradual

00:39:46.915 --> 00:39:51.888
emergence, which simply holds
that Israelites were basically

00:39:51.888 --> 00:39:56.861
Canaanites who had developed a
separate identity and settled

00:39:56.861 --> 00:40:00.570
increasingly in the central
highlands.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.389
They withdrew and settled in
this area.

00:40:02.389 --> 00:40:05.150
The theory doesn't try to
explain why they separated.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:07.489
We don't know.
Perhaps it was disaffection.

00:40:07.489 --> 00:40:10.740
Perhaps they were pushed out by
the invading sea peoples.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.730
And maybe it was something else.
 

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:15.349
But they withdrew for some
reason.

00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:18.935
And how and why they took up
the worship of Yahweh or the

00:40:18.935 --> 00:40:21.239
cult of Yahweh isn't really
clear;

00:40:21.239 --> 00:40:24.712
but it seems to have been what
marked them as distinct from

00:40:24.712 --> 00:40:25.849
other Canaanites.
 

00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:30.042
The Yahweh cult may have been
introduced by people escaping

00:40:30.042 --> 00:40:31.559
slavery from Egypt.
 

00:40:31.559 --> 00:40:34.636
Most scholars see the Exodus
story as evidence for the

00:40:34.636 --> 00:40:37.829
presence of some escaped slaves
among this community.

00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:42.161
So the important thing is that
the Hebrews at this stage were

00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:44.400
probably not a united people.
 

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.129
Various elements went into the
final mix that would emerge as

00:40:48.129 --> 00:40:50.739
the nation Israel:
local Canaanites who,

00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:53.417
for some reason,
withdrew and established their

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:55.861
own settlements,
with a continuous material

00:40:55.861 --> 00:40:58.805
culture,
and established agricultural

00:40:58.805 --> 00:41:00.889
lifestyle--you have them.
 

00:41:00.889 --> 00:41:02.869
You have escaping slaves from
Egypt.

00:41:02.869 --> 00:41:05.251
And remember,
we do have some evidence of

00:41:05.251 --> 00:41:08.466
destruction from outside,
so there could also have been

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:11.920
some foreigners coming in and
destroying and settling.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.053
It even seems that some local
foreigners were admitted to the

00:41:15.053 --> 00:41:17.057
community.
We read of Midianites who

00:41:17.057 --> 00:41:18.710
covenant into the community .
 

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:22.539
We read of Kenites who covenant
into the community.

00:41:22.539 --> 00:41:26.992
And archaeology supports this
picture of merging of peoples,

00:41:26.992 --> 00:41:29.860
a picture of the merging of
peoples,

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.058
rather than conquest or even
large-scale immigration,

00:41:33.058 --> 00:41:36.872
because the new settlements in
this period show such continuity

00:41:36.872 --> 00:41:39.397
with the past,
not a complete break,

00:41:39.397 --> 00:41:42.570
not the initiation of something
radically new.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:45.107
And, again, some of the
elements within this group may

00:41:45.107 --> 00:41:47.931
have brought with them the story
of a miraculous escape from

00:41:47.931 --> 00:41:50.375
Egypt.
They may have understood this

00:41:50.375 --> 00:41:53.764
to be the work of Yahweh,
a god known probably from

00:41:53.764 --> 00:41:55.119
southern regions.
 

00:41:55.119 --> 00:41:59.116
And so the mixed group that
would join together to become

00:41:59.116 --> 00:42:02.954
Israel accepted Yahweh,
though perhaps not exclusively,

00:42:02.954 --> 00:42:07.063
and adopted the national story
of the Exodus as its own at some

00:42:07.063 --> 00:42:08.751
point.
The Hebrew tribes,

00:42:08.751 --> 00:42:12.329
themselves, were likely still
in the process of formation.

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:15.963
But the tribal structure of
Israelite society that would

00:42:15.963 --> 00:42:20.190
develop would be strengthened by
the natural division of the land

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:24.352
into these separate geographical
areas: that only reinforced the

00:42:24.352 --> 00:42:26.400
tribalization of society.
 

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:30.494
And these local tribes probably
did assimilate elements of the

00:42:30.494 --> 00:42:31.769
local population.
 

00:42:31.769 --> 00:42:35.797
We've really seen already the
ethnic mix of various elements

00:42:35.797 --> 00:42:39.210
reflected in religious imagery
and institutions.

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:42.456
We've seen that Yahweh is
represented in terms reminiscent

00:42:42.456 --> 00:42:45.735
of the tent dweller,
El, the god of the semi-nomadic

00:42:45.735 --> 00:42:48.610
tent-dwelling Hebrews and their
patriarchs,

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.369
and certainly a god of the
Canaanite pantheon.

00:42:51.369 --> 00:42:54.299
We have seen that Yahweh is
also represented in terms

00:42:54.299 --> 00:42:56.835
reminiscent of Baal of the
Canaanite pantheon,

00:42:56.835 --> 00:42:59.539
the God of the settled
Canaanite population.

00:42:59.539 --> 00:43:02.877
In fact, in the book of Judges,
you will read of a temple to

00:43:02.877 --> 00:43:05.139
Israel's God,
the God of the Covenant,

00:43:05.139 --> 00:43:09.447
and that temple is called the
Temple to the God of the

00:43:09.447 --> 00:43:11.480
Covenant or Baal Berit.
 

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.710
The word "berit" means
covenant.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:19.511
It is referred to as Baal Berit;
it's referred to as El Berit or

00:43:19.511 --> 00:43:22.227
Baal El Berit;
and this is in reference to

00:43:22.227 --> 00:43:24.212
Yahweh.
These terms are all used to

00:43:24.212 --> 00:43:26.179
describe the God of the
Covenant.

00:43:26.179 --> 00:43:29.124
So in short,
we really may hypothesize a

00:43:29.124 --> 00:43:32.747
union of cultural,
religious and ethnic elements:

00:43:32.747 --> 00:43:37.366
local Canaanite agriculturists,
semi-nomadic Hebrews perhaps,

00:43:37.366 --> 00:43:39.343
of the Exodus,
escaped slaves,

00:43:39.343 --> 00:43:43.072
perhaps Habiru/Abiru,
a disaffected group that is in

00:43:43.072 --> 00:43:44.978
revolt.
All of these would come

00:43:44.978 --> 00:43:48.614
together to produce what would
be a new political and religious

00:43:48.614 --> 00:43:50.079
reality called Israel.
 

00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:54.471
If so, why does the book of
Joshua provide such a different

00:43:54.471 --> 00:43:59.014
account, one of outside conquest
by means of a war led by the

00:43:59.014 --> 00:44:00.679
hosts of the Lord?
 

00:44:00.679 --> 00:44:03.607
Because in this account
military skill is much less

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:06.360
important than ritual
preparation and purity.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.542
The Israelites march around
Jericho for six days with seven

00:44:09.542 --> 00:44:12.780
priests carrying seven horns and
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.730
and then with a blast and a
shout the walls tumble.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:19.559
The conquest is represented as
a miraculous victory by God.

00:44:19.559 --> 00:44:22.179
That's emphasized in Joshua
24:12.

00:44:22.179 --> 00:44:26.160
It was God, not the sword or
the bow, that drove out the

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.087
enemy.
And why the claim of the utter

00:44:29.087 --> 00:44:33.626
destruction of the Canaanites
when evidence points to close

00:44:33.626 --> 00:44:35.269
Canaanite origins?
 

00:44:35.269 --> 00:44:37.485
This practice,
which I mentioned before and is

00:44:37.485 --> 00:44:40.440
known as herem or the
ban, is not unique to Israel.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.715
I know some of you have studied
it in sections:

00:44:42.715 --> 00:44:44.842
you looked at the inscription
of King Mesha,

00:44:44.842 --> 00:44:45.980
King Mesha of Moab.
 

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:51.097
There is a very important,
famous inscription from the

00:44:51.097 --> 00:44:55.635
ninth century BCE,
written by King Mesha of Moab

00:44:55.635 --> 00:44:59.980
Moab is to the southeast of the
Dead Sea,

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:01.750
so King Mesha of Moab.
 

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:04.528
And in the inscription he
writes, he boasts:

00:45:04.528 --> 00:45:08.469
"And the god Chemosh said to
me, go, take Nebo from Israel.

00:45:08.469 --> 00:45:11.833
So I went by night and fought
against it from the break of

00:45:11.833 --> 00:45:14.547
dawn until noon,
taking it and slaying all 7000

00:45:14.547 --> 00:45:16.569
men,
boys, women and girls and maid

00:45:16.569 --> 00:45:19.564
servants, for I had devoted them
to destruction for the god

00:45:19.564 --> 00:45:21.940
Ashtar Chemosh",
referring to herem.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.983
It is likely that such claims
are hyperbolic in Moab,

00:45:24.983 --> 00:45:27.909
and it is likely they were
hyperbolic in Israel.

00:45:27.909 --> 00:45:31.032
But that does not lessen the
shock value for a modern reader,

00:45:31.032 --> 00:45:33.947
even though war in our time is
no less savage and no less

00:45:33.947 --> 00:45:36.528
brutal.
But the important question here

00:45:36.528 --> 00:45:40.350
is why a biblical writer or
editor would want to insist that

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.590
the Canaanites were to be
completely destroyed.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:47.286
I think assertions of national
identity and independence are

00:45:47.286 --> 00:45:50.420
often predicated on
differentiation from others.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.863
If the Israelites were,
in fact, basically Canaanites,

00:45:52.863 --> 00:45:55.030
who had withdrawn from the
larger collective,

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:57.684
who insisted on the
overlordship of Yahweh,

00:45:57.684 --> 00:46:01.413
then Canaanites who did not
join them in this were a special

00:46:01.413 --> 00:46:03.309
threat to the new Yahwism.
 

00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:07.117
This same dynamic of intense
sibling rivalry appears again in

00:46:07.117 --> 00:46:09.909
the first few centuries of the
Common Era,

00:46:09.909 --> 00:46:12.814
when some Jews separated from
others and in differentiating

00:46:12.814 --> 00:46:15.769
themselves and creating their
own identity as Christians,

00:46:15.769 --> 00:46:19.329
felt it necessary to engage in
devastatingly vituperative and

00:46:19.329 --> 00:46:22.000
violent rhetoric against their
fellow Jews.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.326
The interesting thing,
however, is that we must not

00:46:24.326 --> 00:46:26.699
ignore another voice that's in
the biblical text,

00:46:26.699 --> 00:46:29.746
and it is a voice that adds a
level of complexity to this

00:46:29.746 --> 00:46:32.083
picture.
Because alongside the idealized

00:46:32.083 --> 00:46:35.266
portrayal of the Israelite
conquest in the first half of

00:46:35.266 --> 00:46:38.230
the book of Joshua,
alongside the call for the

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:42.002
destruction of all Canaanites,
we find interesting tales of

00:46:42.002 --> 00:46:45.840
alliances and incorporation of
various Canaanite groups.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:49.510
Indeed, who was one the
heroines of the Battle of

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:53.716
Jericho, if not a Canaanite
woman, a prostitute no less,

00:46:53.716 --> 00:46:56.307
named Rahab.
She declares her faith in

00:46:56.307 --> 00:46:59.260
Yahweh and she delivers the city
into Joshua's hands.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:03.199
The biblical writer saw fit to
preserve and include this

00:47:03.199 --> 00:47:06.280
account of a heroic Canaanite
prostitute.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.607
Another Canaanite group,
the Gibeonites,

00:47:08.607 --> 00:47:11.949
trick the Israelites into
making a covenant with them,

00:47:11.949 --> 00:47:15.012
and it is a covenant the
Israelites then feel bound to

00:47:15.012 --> 00:47:17.443
observe.
Michael Coogan has described

00:47:17.443 --> 00:47:19.760
such stories as etiological
tales.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.953
They are attempts to explain
the fact that there are lots of

00:47:22.953 --> 00:47:25.010
Canaanite groups included in
Israel;

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:28.590
and we need to understand and
explain that reality as much as

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:32.290
we are conveying an ideological
account in which all Canaanites

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.260
are obliterated or destroyed.
 

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:37.541
At the very least,
these stories raise questions

00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:41.382
about the biblical portrait or
portrayal of invasion and

00:47:41.382 --> 00:47:43.060
conquest.
And at most,

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.592
they illustrate the biblical
writers' taste for literary

00:47:46.592 --> 00:47:49.867
subversion yet again,
something we will see over and

00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:52.584
over.
The imperative of preserving a

00:47:52.584 --> 00:47:56.524
distinct identity--based on
giving up the worship of other

00:47:56.524 --> 00:48:00.811
gods or older gods and observing
all that is written in the law

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:04.544
of Moses--is reiterated in
Joshua's farewell address in

00:48:04.544 --> 00:48:08.005
Joshua 23,
and in the covenant renewal

00:48:08.005 --> 00:48:11.065
ceremony in 24.
And the central idea is that

00:48:11.065 --> 00:48:14.780
there is one proper response to
God's mighty acts on behalf of

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:17.008
Israel,
and that is resolute observance

00:48:17.008 --> 00:48:19.879
of the book of the Torah of
Moses, without intermingling

00:48:19.879 --> 00:48:21.550
with the peoples that remain.
 

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:24.576
So in Joshua 23:7-8:
"Do not utter the names of

00:48:24.576 --> 00:48:28.083
their gods or swear by them;
do not serve them or bow down

00:48:28.083 --> 00:48:31.202
to them, but hold fast to the
Lord your God as you have done

00:48:31.202 --> 00:48:33.699
this day."
And verses 11 to 13:

00:48:33.699 --> 00:48:36.017
For you own sakes,
therefore, be most mindful to

00:48:36.017 --> 00:48:37.110
love the Lord your God.
 

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:40.127
For should you turn away and
attach yourselves to the remnant

00:48:40.127 --> 00:48:42.842
of these nations--to those that
are left among you--and

00:48:42.842 --> 00:48:45.272
intermarry with them,
you joining them and they

00:48:45.272 --> 00:48:48.085
joining you, know for certain
that the Lord your God will not

00:48:48.085 --> 00:48:50.429
continue to drive these nations
out before you;

00:48:50.429 --> 00:48:52.466
they shall become a snare and a
trap for you,

00:48:52.466 --> 00:48:54.780
a scourge to your sides and
thorns in your eyes,

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:58.151
until you perish from this good
land that the Lord your God has

00:48:58.151 --> 00:49:00.474
given you.
In 24, the Israelites are

00:49:00.474 --> 00:49:02.733
assembled at Shechem to renew
the covenant,

00:49:02.733 --> 00:49:05.799
and Joshua recounts God's
mighty deeds on behalf of Israel

00:49:05.799 --> 00:49:08.327
and exhorts them to choose whom
they will serve:

00:49:08.327 --> 00:49:10.786
Yahweh,
who has done all of this for

00:49:10.786 --> 00:49:13.651
them so undeservedly,
or the gods of those whose

00:49:13.651 --> 00:49:15.480
lands they are settling in.
 

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.610
And the people are warned of
God's jealousy.

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:19.449
He demands exclusive loyalty.
 

00:49:19.449 --> 00:49:22.796
He will not tolerate any
deviation in the service of

00:49:22.796 --> 00:49:25.172
alien gods.
The ban on intermarriage here

00:49:25.172 --> 00:49:26.170
is quite specific.
 

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:28.481
It is directed against
Canaanites only,

00:49:28.481 --> 00:49:31.522
not all non-Israelites,
for a very specific reason:

00:49:31.522 --> 00:49:32.800
religious purity.
 

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.887
Marriage with Canaanites,
the people closest to you,

00:49:35.887 --> 00:49:38.308
specifically,
will lead to the worship of

00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:41.561
that spouse's god,
and Israel is to show undivided

00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:44.228
loyalty to God,
or God will take the gift of

00:49:44.228 --> 00:49:47.079
the land from her as he did the
Canaanites.

00:49:47.079 --> 00:49:49.949
One last remark for you to
think about.

00:49:49.949 --> 00:49:53.481
Consider the position of the
Israelites in the sixth century,

00:49:53.481 --> 00:49:57.190
the time of the final editing
of the Deuteronomistic history.

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:59.539
The Israelites are sitting in
exile in Babylon.

00:49:59.539 --> 00:50:02.437
They are trying to make sense
of the tragedy that has befallen

00:50:02.437 --> 00:50:03.909
them, the loss of their land.
 

00:50:03.909 --> 00:50:08.127
Consider how a text like Joshua
23 and Joshua 24 would go a long

00:50:08.127 --> 00:50:11.943
way towards explaining their
fate while retaining faith in

00:50:11.943 --> 00:50:14.207
Yahweh.
We're going to return to this

00:50:14.207 --> 00:50:17.525
when we reach the conclusion of
the Deuteronomistic history in 2

00:50:17.525 --> 00:50:18.000
Kings.

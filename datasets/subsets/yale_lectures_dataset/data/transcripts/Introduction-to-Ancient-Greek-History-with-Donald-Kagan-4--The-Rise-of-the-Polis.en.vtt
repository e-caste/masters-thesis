00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.844
Professor Donald
Kagan: Last time I was

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:08.570
talking to you about the world
of Homer from the side of,

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.334
you might say,
the life of the mind rather

00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:17.842
than the practical matters of
society by talking about values

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:21.240
and ethics in the world of
Homer.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.529
I also spoke to you about the
heroic ethic,

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.350
which is the dominant element
in this system of theirs.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:41.550
Another way of looking at it is
that it is an aristocratic way

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.774
of thinking and feeling.
At the core of it,

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:51.450
is the concept of
arête.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.511
Now, that's a word that causes
us some problems because it

00:00:56.511 --> 00:01:01.840
comes to mean even in antiquity
something quite different,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.395
and especially if you're
talking about Christianity which

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:10.101
adopts the word as well,
where it comes to mean

00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:13.790
goodness, goodness in a kind of
a Christian sense.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.276
Well, erase all of those ideas
from your head when you think

00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:21.360
about the world of Homer,
and I would say,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.580
the world of Greece in the
period we're studying.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.204
Arête derives from
the Greek word anar,

00:01:29.204 --> 00:01:33.959
which means man;
man as opposed to woman.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:40.670
These are the masculine
qualities as the Greeks saw them

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.527
and primarily among them was the
idea of courage:

00:01:46.527 --> 00:01:50.718
physical courage,
moral courage,

00:01:50.718 --> 00:01:55.951
mental courage,
manly courage in battle is the

00:01:55.951 --> 00:02:01.462
most core aspect of this word,
an idea which comes to spread

00:02:01.462 --> 00:02:04.000
and to be much more encompassing
than that.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.409
I guess the most neutral way to
translate the word is

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:17.831
excellence, prowess,
the ability to do something or

00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:23.946
to be something,
which is admired in the fullest

00:02:23.946 --> 00:02:27.727
way possible.
Some of the desired

00:02:27.727 --> 00:02:32.625
quality, some of the examples of
arête are courage

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:36.176
as I've said,
but also beauty,

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:43.609
strength, the ability to
perform athletics very well,

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:50.134
but also to speak very well.
And it is an extraordinary

00:02:50.134 --> 00:02:54.647
thing I think for modern people
to see that there are two

00:02:54.647 --> 00:02:59.643
central heroes in the poems of
Homer-Achilles the great central

00:02:59.643 --> 00:03:04.800
figure of the Iliad who
represents physical courage,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.792
strength, power,
beauty, speed,

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:08.985
all of those things,
and Odysseus,

00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:13.363
the hero of the Odyssey,
but present and very important

00:03:13.363 --> 00:03:16.198
in both poems.
He has also got all of these

00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:20.072
things, but the thing that sets
him apart, that makes him the

00:03:20.072 --> 00:03:24.550
special kind of hero he is,
is his skill in speech which

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.449
doesn't mean only that he
pronounces words very well,

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.874
or that he selects them very
well for beautifully or

00:03:32.874 --> 00:03:36.038
something.
But rather that he is

00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:40.868
enormously clever,
that he can use speech to

00:03:40.868 --> 00:03:47.720
achieve practical ends just as
he uses strength and power,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.848
and all those other things.
The Greeks, in Homer's world,

00:03:52.848 --> 00:03:58.949
seem to regard one just about
as well as they do the other.

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.444
Odysseus is the man,
the wily Odysseus as Homer

00:04:03.444 --> 00:04:07.060
calls him, the man of many
devices,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.502
all of those things are great
and they are equally honored

00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:16.100
along with the physical courage
that is so characteristic of

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.270
these guys.

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:26.579
The recognition of those
qualities, the recognition of

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:30.851
the arête that
these heroes have is what their

00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:33.330
lives are all about.
First of all,

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.389
they have to have these
qualities, but it's not enough.

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.603
They must be recognized by the
people among whom they lived,

00:04:40.603 --> 00:04:43.459
by the communities in which
they live.

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:48.557
The highest rewards the
individual can have is the

00:04:48.557 --> 00:04:53.343
recognition of their fellow men
for their very,

00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:58.301
very high qualities.
We are talking about a society,

00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:02.113
therefore, the anthropologists
have come up with,

00:05:02.113 --> 00:05:05.370
which I think is a useful
distinction.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.101
Societies, based on shame,
as opposed to those that

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:12.860
practice guilt;
guilt is something very

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.001
internal and personal.
Shame is something very

00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:21.469
external and public.
How you are treated and greeted

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:27.055
is what makes your worth.
So, it is from the beginning a

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:31.600
society in which the community
is a critical element,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.548
maybe the critical element,
an individual who didn't live

00:05:35.548 --> 00:05:39.850
in a society could not achieve
the kinds of glory and fame,

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.800
and recognition that you expect
from a hero.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.137
All of these heroes are
aristocrats in the traditional

00:05:50.137 --> 00:05:54.276
sense of the word;
they arrive at their high

00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:59.300
standing in their community by
virtue of birth.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.184
You are born to be one of these
people because your father was

00:06:05.184 --> 00:06:10.779
such a person belonging to the
right families and so on.

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:15.385
The noble families of Greece,
and we see it already in Homer,

00:06:15.385 --> 00:06:19.836
typically claim descent from
some god or other and ordinary

00:06:19.836 --> 00:06:22.600
people do not have that ability.

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:32.300
The family and the individual
are the critical elements.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.471
A larger community,
meaning your entire village,

00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:39.666
your entire city,
your entire region,

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:43.610
that is barely mentioned.
That is not talked about.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.496
Again, think about Achilles,
when he refuses to do what he's

00:06:47.496 --> 00:06:51.448
supposed -- to fight with the
Greeks because he's had a fight

00:06:51.448 --> 00:06:53.708
with Agamemnon,
nobody says,

00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:57.910
"Wait a minute that's treason,
you can't do that.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.969
You've been signed up by your
city or by this expedition to

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:04.430
fight and you've got to fight."
Nobody says that.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.040
What they say is,
"Oh please, we need you

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.246
Achilles, you must not do this."
But nobody says,

00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:16.459
"Arrest that man,
he has broken his debt;

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:18.490
he's not performing his debt to
the community."

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.397
Everybody knows that all those
heroes are there because they

00:07:22.397 --> 00:07:24.980
want to be and they want to be
there,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.557
so that they can earn both the
wealth that can be taken from a

00:07:30.557 --> 00:07:34.258
defeated city,
but even more important,

00:07:34.258 --> 00:07:39.389
the kind of fame and glory that
comes with such deeds.

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:43.493
I've already told you the story
about Achilles having the choice

00:07:43.493 --> 00:07:46.879
of living forever without fame
or dying with fame,

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:50.170
and he makes the choice for
death and fame.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.571
That, I think, is very critical.
That attitude,

00:07:54.571 --> 00:07:58.308
that point of view,
even after the world of Homer

00:07:58.308 --> 00:08:02.590
is gone, remains a very powerful
influence on the Greeks

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.860
throughout the rest of their
history,

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.491
so that you have built into
that society an inherent

00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:13.697
conflict.
After all, even these heroes

00:08:13.697 --> 00:08:17.797
need communities in which to
live for all the various

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:22.489
purposes that human beings do.
So, you would think they have

00:08:22.489 --> 00:08:26.543
some allegiance to them.
They do, but they also have an

00:08:26.543 --> 00:08:30.149
allegiance to their families and
to themselves,

00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:33.713
which, in Homer,
tend to predominate,

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:39.850
and yet there is a sense in
which the conflict is very real.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.678
If you look at the problem in
Homer, Achilles when he

00:08:43.678 --> 00:08:46.844
withdraws and refuses to fight
for the army,

00:08:46.844 --> 00:08:49.789
nobody can tell him to do
otherwise.

00:08:49.789 --> 00:08:54.259
He has a right to do that but
that means that something is

00:08:54.259 --> 00:08:59.120
wrong and it's very clear that
he has been overcome by rage and

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.511
he is not behaving in the
sensible way--that even a Greek

00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:08.529
hero is supposed to and he has
not brought back to normal,

00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:10.679
to a position in which people
can say, yes,

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:13.750
well, you're a great hero and
you're not out of your mind.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.440
Even Achilles gives up his
rage, and he allows--you

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.129
remember he allows Priam to bury
his son Hector,

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:25.779
something he would have refused
to do in his rage.

00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:30.113
So, even Achilles has got to
come to terms with the community

00:09:30.113 --> 00:09:33.580
norms, in order to be living in
a proper life,

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.859
and this conflict between his
family and private desires and

00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:41.849
needs, and those of the
community will be characteristic

00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:45.984
very strongly of the Greek way
of life for the rest of its

00:09:45.984 --> 00:09:49.054
history,
not always in precisely the

00:09:49.054 --> 00:09:53.140
same form but it will be there.
Competition,

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.655
again, is rearing its head.
It's another form of

00:09:57.655 --> 00:10:02.208
competition, the competition
between these two sources of

00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:07.004
values, the community at large
versus the individual and the

00:10:07.004 --> 00:10:10.553
family.
This kind of tension doesn't

00:10:10.553 --> 00:10:13.908
make things clear;
the rules are not absolute,

00:10:13.908 --> 00:10:16.470
and not everybody fits into a
pigeon hole.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.291
It is not easy to say,
what is the right thing,

00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:24.571
or what is the wrong thing.
All of that creates confusion,

00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:28.889
problems, but also,
conflict, tension,

00:10:28.889 --> 00:10:32.820
competition,
all those things create a

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:38.316
degree of freedom which doesn't
permit the typical despotic kind

00:10:38.316 --> 00:10:42.940
of culture which characterizes
almost all of the human

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:48.960
experiences that we know in the
early history of the human race.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:55.081
So, I want to turn now to
the way in which this way of

00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:59.269
thinking had an impact on the
future,

00:10:59.269 --> 00:11:02.924
and of course I'm speaking
about the future of Western

00:11:02.924 --> 00:11:06.509
civilization which was the heir
to this tradition.

00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:10.994
I mentioned to you already,
last time, that in a way the

00:11:10.994 --> 00:11:14.947
poems are a kind of a bible.
It is the source of all

00:11:14.947 --> 00:11:18.290
knowledge and wisdom that
anybody who knows anything

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.864
knows,
and how they were used for

00:11:20.864 --> 00:11:25.442
practical purposes as when the
Spartans made a decision about

00:11:25.442 --> 00:11:30.250
who owned Salamis based on what
it said in the Iliad,

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:35.220
but it's also important to
realize how those poems inspired

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.190
the imagination of Greeks for
the rest of their history.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.110
Another fact is that we are
told that when Alexander the

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.460
Great went out to conquer the
Persian Empire,

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.411
and as far as he was concerned,
to conquer everything he could

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:55.169
reach, he carried with him a
copy of the Iliad which

00:11:55.169 --> 00:11:57.889
it is alleged he put under his
pillow.

00:11:57.889 --> 00:12:01.267
This is a problem when you
consider that books in the days

00:12:01.267 --> 00:12:04.230
were not likely to be codices as
they are today,

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.759
but scrolls that took up quite
a lot of space.

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:10.997
I don't know quite how Alex
managed it but that's what they

00:12:10.997 --> 00:12:13.230
say, but the principle is
established.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.783
It was clear,
he was another Achilles in his

00:12:16.783 --> 00:12:21.824
own eyes, and it was for him to
achieve the great deeds that I

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:27.187
have been mentioning.
Now, if you look at the

00:12:27.187 --> 00:12:34.515
story of Western civilization,
it provides a very interesting

00:12:34.515 --> 00:12:40.002
contrast within it and the,
I'm sorry, the Greek experience

00:12:40.002 --> 00:12:43.590
that I'm talking about now based
upon what you see in Homer,

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.236
provides a contrast within a
competition to the other great

00:12:47.236 --> 00:12:49.500
tradition of Western
civilization,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.340
which is the Judeo-Christian
tradition.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:58.201
I just want to make a few small
points that indicate how that

00:12:58.201 --> 00:13:01.169
works.
The Iliad begins--the

00:13:01.169 --> 00:13:05.560
first word in the Iliad
is the accusative noun,

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.460
mÄ“nin,
wrath, anger.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.050
I am singing about the wrath,
the anger Achilles which

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.899
brought so many men to their
doom, is what Homer says.

00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:24.480
The first thing is the emotion
of an individual man.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.714
The Odyssey begins even
more strikingly with the word

00:13:27.714 --> 00:13:29.358
andra,
the accusative of

00:13:29.358 --> 00:13:33.628
anÄ“r,
the accusative case of a man,

00:13:33.628 --> 00:13:38.037
and he says,
sing to me goddess about that

00:13:38.037 --> 00:13:41.804
man,
that man of many devices,

00:13:41.804 --> 00:13:46.536
that clever man Odysseus.
The Aeneid of Virgil

00:13:46.536 --> 00:13:48.802
based, of course,
on the Iliad and the

00:13:48.802 --> 00:13:53.544
Odyssey,
begins arma virumque

00:13:53.544 --> 00:14:02.500
cano, I sing of arms and the
man, the man Aeneas.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.899
What are the Greeks talking
about?

00:14:04.899 --> 00:14:09.451
I'm talking about individual
men, extraordinary men and the

00:14:09.451 --> 00:14:13.690
events that emerge from them and
the life they lead.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:19.174
Well, look at our Bible.
It begins--this will be news to

00:14:19.174 --> 00:14:24.448
most of you;
in the beginning God created

00:14:24.448 --> 00:14:29.509
the heavens and the Earth and
it.

00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:34.376
The book goes right on to talk
about God, what he does,

00:14:34.376 --> 00:14:40.668
sometimes why he does it,
what is the effect of what he

00:14:40.668 --> 00:14:47.320
does, but the center of our book
is God, not man.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.016
It's not just an accident that
this reveals the characteristic

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:57.382
of each one of these cultures.
The Greeks had a humanistic

00:14:57.382 --> 00:15:01.426
outlook on life.
They believed in the gods,

00:15:01.426 --> 00:15:06.369
they were religious people,
but the core of their lives was

00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:11.654
shaped by human things in a way
different from what was true of

00:15:11.654 --> 00:15:15.490
the Hebrews and the Christians
later on,

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:20.795
that is a Divine view.
The secular approach is very,

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:24.899
very Greek versus a religious
approach.

00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:31.089
The Greek view,
moreover, presupposes that man

00:15:31.089 --> 00:15:37.059
lives in society.
He is not a creature off by

00:15:37.059 --> 00:15:39.798
himself.
By definition,

00:15:39.798 --> 00:15:43.450
he necessarily lives in
society.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:48.850
He is conceivable to the Greeks
only in a society.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.978
The Iliad,
which is about a war,

00:15:51.978 --> 00:15:56.753
immediately is a kind of an
artificial society put together

00:15:56.753 --> 00:16:02.269
for the purpose of defeating the
Trojans and taking their city.

00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:06.232
As I've suggested to you,
the values that are the most

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:09.956
important are community values.
That is to say,

00:16:09.956 --> 00:16:14.814
the reward of good behavior is
the admiration and the honor

00:16:14.814 --> 00:16:19.715
that a hero gets,
and the most serious punishment

00:16:19.715 --> 00:16:25.750
he can suffer is to be shamed in
front of that community.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.213
Aristotle, writing late in the
Greek tradition,

00:16:29.213 --> 00:16:33.580
but still powerfully influenced
by these kinds of ideas,

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.681
speaks about man as a--the
Greek words are a politicon

00:16:37.681 --> 00:16:42.222
zoon, and I think the best
way to understand it is to think

00:16:42.222 --> 00:16:47.050
of it as meaning,
man is a creature who lives in

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.450
a polis,
in a city state,

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:54.289
in a Greek kind of a city
state.

00:16:54.289 --> 00:17:00.660
In the same general passage he
says, a man who is by nature

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:07.140
without a polis is either
more or less than a man.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.304
What he means by that is,
if a man is superior to the

00:17:10.304 --> 00:17:12.738
polis doesn't need a
polis,

00:17:12.738 --> 00:17:15.660
he is a god because men need a
polis.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.803
If he is beneath the
polis it means he's

00:17:18.803 --> 00:17:21.400
beneath what it is to a human
being,

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.099
and that tells you just how
potent is this concept of a

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:31.495
community for the Greeks and it
emerges in its own way from the

00:17:31.495 --> 00:17:34.890
Iliad in the
Odyssey.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:39.940
Odysseus also was offered
an opportunity to live forever.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.385
When he was shipwrecked on the
island in which the goddess

00:17:44.385 --> 00:17:48.130
Calypso ruled,
she fell in love with Odysseus,

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:53.357
just as the fate of great
heroes--they are heroic and

00:17:53.357 --> 00:17:57.480
handsome, and fast and women
love them.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.016
She says, just stay with me and
I--you will live forever and all

00:18:02.016 --> 00:18:06.279
will be well and he says,
well, you're a very beautiful

00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:11.079
girl and I enjoy you a lot,
but I got to go back to Ithaca.

00:18:11.079 --> 00:18:13.710
Now, why does he have to go
back to Ithaca?

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.584
Well, he has a wife whom he
loves, Penelope,

00:18:17.584 --> 00:18:22.990
and he has a son whom he has
barely seen because he had to go

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:28.216
off to Troy almost 20 years ago
to fight that battle and he

00:18:28.216 --> 00:18:33.173
hasn't been home since.
Those are very powerful pulls

00:18:33.173 --> 00:18:37.861
that we easily do understand,
but it's also true that he is

00:18:37.861 --> 00:18:42.220
the king in Ithaca,
and when he returns to Ithaca

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:47.470
he immediately moves into a
position of honor and respect,

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.881
which is a critical part of his
own sense of himself,

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:55.700
of what he needs to be what he
wants to be.

00:18:59.849 --> 00:19:02.416
We don't have in American
society an Iliad,

00:19:02.416 --> 00:19:04.789
an Odyssey,
we don't have our own bible,

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:09.273
but I think Mark Twain's Huck
Finn is really very,

00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:14.489
very revealing to see what is
so different about us in the

00:19:14.489 --> 00:19:18.150
modern times from the Homeric
world.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.990
When things don't go right for
Huck, what does he do?

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.765
He lights out and wants to get
away from society,

00:19:28.765 --> 00:19:31.990
he wants to go wandering and
exploring,

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.401
as an individual rejecting
society, fleeing for his

00:19:39.401 --> 00:19:42.470
individualism,
and that tradition,

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:47.624
as you all know--how many
examples can we think of works

00:19:47.624 --> 00:19:52.123
that really project the
greatness of being all by

00:19:52.123 --> 00:19:57.010
yourself and away from people,
and away from society.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:02.109
That's where good things are.
The Greeks would have thought

00:20:02.109 --> 00:20:05.882
you were out of your mind,
or that you were some kind of

00:20:05.882 --> 00:20:09.440
barbarian, but that's okay.
People who have never known of

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.749
civil society;
people who have never known of

00:20:11.749 --> 00:20:13.932
a world with polis,
well, of course,

00:20:13.932 --> 00:20:16.220
they would do something stupid
like that.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.670
I think that's an interesting
contrast.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:24.670
Now, let me carry on with
this by talking about the views

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.670
of society which are
characteristic of the two

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.270
traditions in Western
civilization.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:34.916
What do we see in the Bible?
When God decides to invent man,

00:20:34.916 --> 00:20:38.470
he places him in the Garden of
Eden.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:42.134
The Garden of Eden contains,
first of all,

00:20:42.134 --> 00:20:45.529
just Adam and then when God
decides,

00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:49.838
for his own reasons,
that he needs a companion,

00:20:49.838 --> 00:20:54.770
he invents one other companion,
Eve.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:21:00.120
Where they live is paradise.
One man, one woman,

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.970
that's all you need,
it's great.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:07.380
Nothing could ever be so good.
Well, what happens?

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.300
They transgress.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.079
Eve persuaded by the serpent,
persuades Adam to do what was

00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:20.160
forbidden by God.
What is forbidden by God?

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.405
It is to eat the fruit of the
tree of knowledge because if

00:21:25.405 --> 00:21:30.651
human beings obtain knowledge,
they will be like the gods,

00:21:30.651 --> 00:21:34.631
and that is unacceptable.
So when you do that,

00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:38.000
you have to be punished.
What is punishment?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.809
To be thrown out of Eden,
to be thrown out of this

00:21:41.809 --> 00:21:44.530
isolated condition of
perfection.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.125
What is perfection?
You don't have to work,

00:21:47.125 --> 00:21:49.659
you can eat without doing
anything about it,

00:21:49.659 --> 00:21:52.960
you don't seem to do much of
anything, which is fine.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.136
Everything is quiet,
peaceful, no problems,

00:21:57.136 --> 00:22:02.588
no action, that's paradise.
A Greek would go crazy at

00:22:02.588 --> 00:22:06.400
the thought.
It is a pre-social,

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.033
a pre-political life.
Life in society what Adam and

00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:16.488
Eve have to encounter now.
They now have to form villages,

00:22:16.488 --> 00:22:19.839
cities, start living among each
other, and so on.

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:25.754
That is the punishment for the
sin of seeking knowledge of good

00:22:25.754 --> 00:22:30.619
and evil and therefore of
straining for divinity.

00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:35.644
Man, the message I think is,
must know his place,

00:22:35.644 --> 00:22:40.039
which is humble and not close
to divine.

00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:45.630
His hope rests simply with God
not with himself.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:50.476
When he tries to take the
things into his own hands,

00:22:50.476 --> 00:22:55.133
and in the process,
to contravene the will of God,

00:22:55.133 --> 00:22:59.220
only terrible things can happen
to him.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.107
It's very interesting,
I think, that in the eighteenth

00:23:03.107 --> 00:23:06.701
century, Rousseau,
who himself seems to me to have

00:23:06.701 --> 00:23:10.882
been a kind of like a poisoned
apple in the history of the

00:23:10.882 --> 00:23:14.600
human race oddly,
revives that biblical view,

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.234
if you think about it.
His view is man was happy and

00:23:19.234 --> 00:23:25.143
good before the invention of
society, which society corrupts

00:23:25.143 --> 00:23:29.650
man and takes away from him his
happiness.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:34.457
What we need to do is undue the
evils that organized society

00:23:34.457 --> 00:23:39.672
have done, and if only we remove
all of the bad things created by

00:23:39.672 --> 00:23:42.296
society,
man would return to his

00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:46.089
naturally perfect virtuous self,
which is of course,

00:23:46.089 --> 00:23:52.699
a major source of individualism
which is this great Western

00:23:52.699 --> 00:23:59.422
force, and the nihilism that I
think inevitably emerges from

00:23:59.422 --> 00:24:02.763
it.
I think people have,

00:24:02.763 --> 00:24:06.260
in different ways,
found in Russo,

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:12.089
the root both of a Nietzschean
nihilism and of Marx,

00:24:12.089 --> 00:24:15.973
and I think there is powerful
reason to do so,

00:24:15.973 --> 00:24:21.151
because you can go in either
one of those directions once you

00:24:21.151 --> 00:24:24.690
start making this kind of
assumption.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:28.458
For the Greeks,
on the other hand as I've said,

00:24:28.458 --> 00:24:33.372
political society was essential
for living any kind of a good

00:24:33.372 --> 00:24:36.212
life.
In the Odyssey,

00:24:36.212 --> 00:24:41.468
you remember Odysseus finds
himself on the island of the

00:24:41.468 --> 00:24:44.853
Cyclops,
those one-eyed monsters,

00:24:44.853 --> 00:24:50.200
and what is it about them that
make them so monstrous,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.680
so inhuman from the perspective
of the Homeric heroes?

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.759
Here's the line that Homer
writes, they live without--the

00:24:58.759 --> 00:25:03.581
Greek word is nomoi,
which we would translate as

00:25:03.581 --> 00:25:08.046
laws, but before they become
laws they are the customary

00:25:08.046 --> 00:25:11.819
norms of society,
in other words, civilization.

00:25:11.819 --> 00:25:15.365
They live without nomoi
and they wreck not of one

00:25:15.365 --> 00:25:18.910
another, that is to say,
each family lives by itself.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:22.321
They have nothing to do with
each other, they do not have a

00:25:22.321 --> 00:25:24.910
community, and they do not have
a society.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:29.036
So, they are,
of course, sort of prehistoric

00:25:29.036 --> 00:25:33.450
monsters as far as the Greeks
are concerned.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:38.775
Now, the Judeo-Christian
story, as I think of it--by the

00:25:38.775 --> 00:25:44.009
way, the word "story" is a
translation or it means the same

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:47.530
thing the Greek word
muthos,

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.973
our word, myth.
A myth, in this sense,

00:25:50.973 --> 00:25:53.440
according to the Greeks,
is just a tale.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.701
It can true,
it can be false,

00:25:55.701 --> 00:25:59.259
and so on.
Anyway, the Judeo-Christian

00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:03.960
story says, in the beginning,
men were innocent.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:09.489
Innocent was the same as
ignorant because knowledge gets

00:26:09.489 --> 00:26:14.717
in the way of their innocence
and they have solitude,

00:26:14.717 --> 00:26:20.218
living in paradise.
What destroys their happy,

00:26:20.218 --> 00:26:27.699
permanent condition is the sin
of pride and the consequence of

00:26:27.699 --> 00:26:31.980
that sin is society,
corruption, pain,

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:36.705
and death because they knew
neither pain nor death while

00:26:36.705 --> 00:26:40.359
they were in Eden.
Salvation is available,

00:26:40.359 --> 00:26:44.540
and with it immortality,
but it comes from God and it

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.240
doesn't come in the world in
which we live,

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.259
but in some other world to be
achieved in the future.

00:26:53.259 --> 00:26:56.263
That, I think,
is a very thumbnail sketch of

00:26:56.263 --> 00:27:00.323
the Judeo-Christian story.
The Greek story is quite

00:27:00.323 --> 00:27:04.166
different.
War is right at the center of

00:27:04.166 --> 00:27:09.055
it, and war itself requires
political and social

00:27:09.055 --> 00:27:12.907
organization.
There can be fighting without

00:27:12.907 --> 00:27:17.057
war but there can be no war
without an organization that

00:27:17.057 --> 00:27:20.980
makes it something more than
just plain fighting.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.900
It requires political and
social organization.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:32.040
The search for honor and glory
are at the root of why men fight

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:37.454
and why they do many,
many other things in their

00:27:37.454 --> 00:27:43.123
lives, according to this view.
The Greeks did have a notion

00:27:43.123 --> 00:27:46.944
that in a way resembles some of
the things I've said about the

00:27:46.944 --> 00:27:51.300
Judeo-Christian story.
They had a concept called

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:56.099
hybris,
to be translated as something

00:27:56.099 --> 00:28:00.117
among these terms,
excess, arrogance,

00:28:00.117 --> 00:28:03.581
violence.
I think the fullest grasp of

00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:07.519
it, I think, might be rendered
best by violent arrogance.

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:11.319
Some notion of being above
yourself and thinking yourself

00:28:11.319 --> 00:28:14.575
more than a man with the
implication that you are

00:28:14.575 --> 00:28:18.171
approaching some kind of
divinity by being more than a

00:28:18.171 --> 00:28:20.971
man,
and acting accordingly,

00:28:20.971 --> 00:28:26.782
which usually requires that you
use violence to achieve what you

00:28:26.782 --> 00:28:29.200
want.
The sort of the standard

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.930
picture in Greek ethics runs
this way.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:36.801
A man is granted too much,
he is too well off,

00:28:36.801 --> 00:28:40.589
he is too rich,
he is too strong,

00:28:40.589 --> 00:28:45.530
he is too beautiful,
so much so that he becomes too

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:51.359
arrogant and is ready to step
beyond his human condition.

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:54.611
At that point,
the gods don't like it because

00:28:54.611 --> 00:28:58.675
like the Judeo-Christian god,
they want to have some boundary

00:28:58.675 --> 00:29:01.295
between the two,
but for them it's very

00:29:01.295 --> 00:29:04.230
important, because the boundary
is far from clear.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.009
So what happens to the man who
has too much?

00:29:08.009 --> 00:29:09.856
He is afflicted with
hybris,

00:29:09.856 --> 00:29:12.299
which leads him to take the
violent action.

00:29:12.299 --> 00:29:15.900
Onto the scene then comes the
goddess Ate,

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.200
which might be translated moral
blindness.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.152
In other words,
he no longer can think straight

00:29:22.152 --> 00:29:24.720
and so he will do something
dangerous,

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.945
harmful, and very ultimately
bad for himself,

00:29:28.945 --> 00:29:32.210
and when he does whatever it
is,

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:38.059
he is struck by Nemesis,
the goddess of retribution.

00:29:38.059 --> 00:29:41.400
Well, of course,
the most famous Greek case,

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.599
I think of these things,
is in Sophocles' play

00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:48.023
Oedipus the King,
which illustrates it perfectly

00:29:48.023 --> 00:29:50.359
well.
Oedipus is a brilliant man;

00:29:50.359 --> 00:29:53.702
he achieves the kingship of his
city because of his

00:29:53.702 --> 00:29:57.380
extraordinary intelligence,
and he's a very good man.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.064
He is king, don't imagine that
he's a despot,

00:30:00.064 --> 00:30:02.339
anything but;
the people love him.

00:30:02.339 --> 00:30:06.680
He saved the city thanks to his
brilliance and his goodwill.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.564
However, after a while,
he comes to be too satisfied,

00:30:10.564 --> 00:30:14.673
too comfortable with his own
brilliance and when another

00:30:14.673 --> 00:30:19.100
threat comes to the city,
he is confident that he can

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:22.450
solve the problem again for his
people.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.354
He is warned by the gods
through seers,

00:30:25.354 --> 00:30:29.862
and by men of wisdom saying,
don't investigate this question

00:30:29.862 --> 00:30:32.450
too far;
you might be making a mistake.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:34.751
He won't listen;
he bowls ahead,

00:30:34.751 --> 00:30:38.540
and he discovers in the process
the terrible,

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.371
terrible truth,
which is that by accident,

00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:46.233
by coincidence,
not by intent that as a young

00:30:46.233 --> 00:30:51.849
man he killed his father and
subsequently married his mother.

00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:55.997
And this most horrible
combination of facts drives

00:30:55.997 --> 00:31:01.076
him--and he's already suffered
from the hybris and the

00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:06.505
atÄ“,
and his retribution is terrible

00:31:06.505 --> 00:31:08.575
in his.
In his madness,

00:31:08.575 --> 00:31:12.553
when he discovered these
things, he tears his own eyes,

00:31:12.553 --> 00:31:14.828
blinds himself.
And, of course,

00:31:14.828 --> 00:31:18.622
now for the rest of his life,
he must just go about as a kind

00:31:18.622 --> 00:31:22.670
of a beggar, having been this
former tremendously great king.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:29.133
So these are examples of
what happens in Greek ethics

00:31:29.133 --> 00:31:35.250
later on, if you are guilty of
this characteristic.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.219
On the other hand,
when he, even Oedipus himself,

00:31:39.219 --> 00:31:42.279
when he understands and he
relents,

00:31:42.279 --> 00:31:45.848
and in a sense he apologizes
for what he's done,

00:31:45.848 --> 00:31:48.430
but more importantly,
he ceases,

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.714
of course, to be powerful and
to act in that way,

00:31:51.714 --> 00:31:54.841
wisdom comes to him.
He understands that,

00:31:54.841 --> 00:31:58.869
he has acted immoderately.
That is the critical concept.

00:31:58.869 --> 00:32:03.685
Moderation is this wonderfully
great important thing for the

00:32:03.685 --> 00:32:06.730
Greeks.
You must act in moderation.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:11.906
They don't ask you to just be
humble and throw yourself on the

00:32:11.906 --> 00:32:16.912
ground and consider yourself as
nothing compared to the god,

00:32:16.912 --> 00:32:20.760
or the gods.
Be a man, be proud of what you

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.662
should be proud of,
but don't go beyond limit of

00:32:24.662 --> 00:32:27.983
what is human,
because if you do terrible

00:32:27.983 --> 00:32:32.399
things will come.
Seek fame, we all want that,

00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:38.039
and I'll say more about that,
but you can't push it too far,

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:44.561
there has to be some kind of a
reasonable human limit to what

00:32:44.561 --> 00:32:48.309
you do.
So, here is this problem.

00:32:48.309 --> 00:32:52.044
A typically Greek problem is
where there is a contradiction

00:32:52.044 --> 00:32:55.750
that you've got to live with;
you can't resolve.

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:59.756
If you want to seek the
fullness of a human experience,

00:32:59.756 --> 00:33:03.170
you have to try to be the best
possible man,

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:07.729
the greatest possible man to
compete successfully against

00:33:07.729 --> 00:33:12.519
others and to achieve fame,
glory, and recognition.

00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:17.432
But if you push it too far you
will anger the gods and

00:33:17.432 --> 00:33:21.140
something terrible will happen
to you.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.882
So, it seems to me,
that Western civilization,

00:33:25.882 --> 00:33:30.519
ever since, has been a
composite of these two

00:33:30.519 --> 00:33:35.316
traditions.
But there is no way to put them

00:33:35.316 --> 00:33:40.711
together, and so Western
civilization is an ambiguous

00:33:40.711 --> 00:33:46.003
society with a war always
ragging within the soul of

00:33:46.003 --> 00:33:52.124
Western civilization and it's
never perfectly clear which of

00:33:52.124 --> 00:33:57.519
the two approaches to life is
the better one.

00:33:57.519 --> 00:34:00.245
I don't know whether any of
you have ever thought about

00:34:00.245 --> 00:34:01.890
this, and anything like this
way.

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:06.936
But if you contemplate your own
way of thinking about what

00:34:06.936 --> 00:34:10.920
you're supposed to be doing with
your life.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.799
I think you will find some
combination, if you're sort of

00:34:14.799 --> 00:34:18.401
typical, but that combination
doesn't ever have to be

00:34:18.401 --> 00:34:21.780
fifty-fifty,
and I'm sure it very rarely is.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.012
More typically,
one aspect of the culture

00:34:25.012 --> 00:34:29.765
dominates rather than the other.
But the shifts in place and

00:34:29.765 --> 00:34:34.146
time, and in many I would say,
throughout most human beings,

00:34:34.146 --> 00:34:36.820
there is a consciousness of
both.

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.391
They both have some attraction
and one has to grapple with

00:34:40.391 --> 00:34:42.867
that.
So, a part of you wants to

00:34:42.867 --> 00:34:47.646
become the greatest whatever it
is that you want to become and

00:34:47.646 --> 00:34:51.956
you wouldn't be here if you
weren't very competitive and

00:34:51.956 --> 00:34:56.681
very eager to come out first,
devoted to arête

00:34:56.681 --> 00:34:59.809
and your own version of that
kind of thing.

00:34:59.809 --> 00:35:05.507
Yet, it's very easy to say to
you that's not a good thing to

00:35:05.507 --> 00:35:07.990
do.
What you should try to do is to

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:12.215
be humble.
You should be like what Jesus

00:35:12.215 --> 00:35:16.699
suggests in the Sermon on the
Mount.

00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:21.543
Your soul is in deep danger if
you indeed continue to lead the

00:35:21.543 --> 00:35:25.354
life that you have mainly been
leading up to now,

00:35:25.354 --> 00:35:28.610
and those two things are in
conflict.

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:32.998
I don't care if you ever go to
church, that is no longer

00:35:32.998 --> 00:35:36.110
confined to a religious
organization.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:41.599
It floats around in Western
civilization all the time.

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:46.119
They're aspects of demand for
performance at the highest

00:35:46.119 --> 00:35:51.133
level, and at the time there is
a great deal of blaming people

00:35:51.133 --> 00:35:55.159
for pursuing such things instead
of humility.

00:35:55.159 --> 00:36:00.531
That's Western civilization,
friends, and the Greeks are at

00:36:00.531 --> 00:36:05.982
the root of the whole thing.
So now, let me turn to my

00:36:05.982 --> 00:36:11.604
next topic, which is to leave
the world of Homer behind us and

00:36:11.604 --> 00:36:16.028
to begin to tell the story of
how it was that the

00:36:16.028 --> 00:36:20.360
characteristic unit of Greek
civilization,

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.463
the polis came into
being out of the Dark Ages about

00:36:25.463 --> 00:36:30.138
which we've said a little bit.
Let me say a little bit,

00:36:30.138 --> 00:36:33.235
first of all,
about the way scholars have

00:36:33.235 --> 00:36:36.099
categorized the history of
Greece.

00:36:36.099 --> 00:36:40.058
Typically, we speak of the
Bronze Age, the Mycenaean Period

00:36:40.058 --> 00:36:42.719
and so on, followed by the Dark
Ages,

00:36:42.719 --> 00:36:46.531
but after that,
you started having refined

00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:52.760
terms which derive actually from
the world of the history of art.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.110
That is because in the Dark
Ages we don't have any writing.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:01.206
So, if you want to designate
anything it has to be by

00:37:01.206 --> 00:37:05.776
tangible things like pottery,
particularly painted pottery,

00:37:05.776 --> 00:37:08.769
because it's easier to
categorize.

00:37:08.769 --> 00:37:11.559
It's from that most of our
terms show up.

00:37:11.559 --> 00:37:16.242
So, for instance,
you will see references to

00:37:16.242 --> 00:37:20.614
words like proto-geometric.
They'll be sort of

00:37:20.614 --> 00:37:23.110
post-Mycenaean then
proto-geometric.

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:27.453
These would be the very
earliest kinds of pots that have

00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:31.954
geometric designs on them,
then comes the geometric period

00:37:31.954 --> 00:37:36.252
and the orientalizing period;
all of these refer to pottery

00:37:36.252 --> 00:37:36.720
styles.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.229
Then next we come to a
larger period,

00:37:44.229 --> 00:37:47.929
which is referred to as the
Archaic Period,

00:37:47.929 --> 00:37:51.650
the Archaic vis-à-vis
the Classical Period,

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:56.357
which is the central subject of
people's interest in the Greeks

00:37:56.357 --> 00:38:01.519
to begin with and later on they
studied its surrounding periods.

00:38:01.519 --> 00:38:07.080
This Archaic Period is roughly
speaking about 750 B.C.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:13.970
to 500 B.C.
Why this period as a unit?

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:17.018
What makes it a unit?
Well, it's around 750,

00:38:17.018 --> 00:38:22.195
a great number of the changes
that moved the Greeks away from

00:38:22.195 --> 00:38:27.200
the Dark Age kind of society to
the full scale polis

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.478
begin.
And 500 but if you were being a

00:38:31.478 --> 00:38:36.096
little more precise,
you would say something

00:38:36.096 --> 00:38:39.570
like--well,
no even 500 isn't really bad,

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:43.307
because if you think about the
Persian wars as being the

00:38:43.307 --> 00:38:45.788
breaking point,
before the Persian Wars,

00:38:45.788 --> 00:38:48.620
you're in the Archaic Period,
after the Persian Wars,

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:52.967
you're in the classical period.
Well, the Persian Wars begin in

00:38:52.967 --> 00:38:56.379
499 B.C.
when Miletus starts the Ionian

00:38:56.379 --> 00:38:58.993
rebellion.
So, that's really,

00:38:58.993 --> 00:39:02.300
I think, the reason for the
dating.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.878
During this Archaic Period,
some of the things that

00:39:05.878 --> 00:39:09.853
happened are these.
The isolation of the Greek

00:39:09.853 --> 00:39:16.113
towns in the Dark Age gives way
increasingly to contact with the

00:39:16.113 --> 00:39:20.323
east and the south,
and when I say the south I

00:39:20.323 --> 00:39:24.760
really mean Egypt and all around
the eastern Aegean Sea.

00:39:27.949 --> 00:39:32.877
The rise of the polis is
based upon critical,

00:39:32.877 --> 00:39:35.679
economic, military,
social,

00:39:35.679 --> 00:39:39.595
and political changes,
all of which produce a world

00:39:39.595 --> 00:39:43.902
that's really strikingly
different from the one that was

00:39:43.902 --> 00:39:48.190
just before it.
I suppose the first apparently

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:53.512
historical event that we know
something about is the first

00:39:53.512 --> 00:39:57.851
Olympic Games,
which according to Greek

00:39:57.851 --> 00:40:02.875
tradition were held in 776 B.C.
The precision of that,

00:40:02.875 --> 00:40:06.447
of course, is not to be taken
seriously, but it gives you a

00:40:06.447 --> 00:40:09.220
general idea of when we are
talking about.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.775
What's interesting about that
is the Olympic games,

00:40:18.775 --> 00:40:22.309
like all of the Pan-Hellenic
Games,

00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:25.210
was that it was not a local
event just for one polis

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:28.516
and maybe for a couple.
It was one to which all the

00:40:28.516 --> 00:40:33.391
people who thought of themselves
as Hellenes, which we would call

00:40:33.391 --> 00:40:37.545
Greeks, took part in.
So, that meant the concept that

00:40:37.545 --> 00:40:41.519
there is something that all of
us are--have in common,

00:40:41.519 --> 00:40:44.520
that make us all Hellenes now
exists.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:50.647
It's not there in Homer.
So that's one thing.Then

00:40:50.647 --> 00:40:54.739
literacy returns to the Greek
world.

00:40:54.739 --> 00:41:00.181
It is as I told you before,
not a development of the

00:41:00.181 --> 00:41:05.942
Mycenaean script which we saw,
but rather a new writing

00:41:05.942 --> 00:41:11.238
system, a true alphabet.
Most of the symbols were

00:41:11.238 --> 00:41:16.530
borrowed from a kind of a
Semitic language and a Semitic

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:20.090
alphabet that came from
Phoenicia,

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:23.690
I would have guessed,
or someplace near it.

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:28.175
I think I mentioned to you that
the Greeks improved upon it and

00:41:28.175 --> 00:41:32.009
made it a true alphabet by
taking some signs that they

00:41:32.009 --> 00:41:35.915
didn't need for their own
language by turning them into

00:41:35.915 --> 00:41:38.786
vowel sounds.
If you read a--well,

00:41:38.786 --> 00:41:43.050
a good example of that kind of
Semitic script is Hebrew.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:46.319
If you read biblical Hebrew,
you have to supply the vowels

00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:48.666
yourself.
You have to know where the

00:41:48.666 --> 00:41:52.164
vowels are supposed to go,
and that makes it harder to

00:41:52.164 --> 00:41:55.363
learn how to read,
but when you have the vowel

00:41:55.363 --> 00:41:59.260
sounds it's easier and the
Greeks made that contribution.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.761
In one of Plato's lesser
known dialogues he makes a

00:42:02.761 --> 00:42:05.159
statement--the following
statement,

00:42:05.159 --> 00:42:09.021
which I think shows both the
typical arrogance of the Greeks

00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:14.302
and also says something true.
He says that the Greeks never

00:42:14.302 --> 00:42:19.462
invented anything,
but everything they borrowed

00:42:19.462 --> 00:42:23.600
they improved upon.
I think they probably also

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.043
invented a few things,
but it was very,

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:29.320
very characteristic of the
Greeks to borrow from the

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:32.469
cultures they encountered and to
adapt them,

00:42:32.469 --> 00:42:36.465
to make them more useful for
their own purposes and nothing

00:42:36.465 --> 00:42:40.530
could be clearer than the
alphabet as an example of that.

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:44.269
Henceforth, we will see writing
in Greece, but now very,

00:42:44.269 --> 00:42:47.851
very little of it.
Of course, what we have is

00:42:47.851 --> 00:42:51.610
confined to things that are not
perishable.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:54.761
These would have been
inscriptions either on pottery,

00:42:54.761 --> 00:42:57.881
which the earliest ones are,
or on stone,

00:42:57.881 --> 00:43:03.631
but otherwise I'm sure there
was writing on perishable

00:43:03.631 --> 00:43:08.043
material-wooden plaques,
probably not yet paper,

00:43:08.043 --> 00:43:10.429
but these would have been
destroyed.

00:43:10.429 --> 00:43:12.350
So what we have is on the
pottery.

00:43:15.929 --> 00:43:20.734
We know that the first
colony that the Greeks

00:43:20.734 --> 00:43:27.039
established was in the Bay of
Naples on the island of Ischia.

00:43:27.039 --> 00:43:31.384
They established a colony
somewhere in the 750's,

00:43:31.384 --> 00:43:35.819
and soon afterwards,
there is a colony established

00:43:35.819 --> 00:43:41.340
on the east coast of Sicily at
what we call Syracuse now,

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:45.767
and a rash of others.
So, the Greeks are in the 750's

00:43:45.767 --> 00:43:51.362
engaged in spreading themselves
from the mainland of Greece and

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:56.717
from the Aegean in general,
even so far out west as Italy

00:43:56.717 --> 00:44:01.739
and Sicily, and soon we know
they are in touch with just

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:05.940
about every place in the
Mediterranean Sea.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.621
In the same period,
there is clear-cut,

00:44:09.621 --> 00:44:13.497
unmistakable,
oriental influence on Greek

00:44:13.497 --> 00:44:17.760
pottery and other things that
they make.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.625
What oriental?
That means mainly the Tigris

00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:23.459
and Euphrates,
Mesopotamia,

00:44:23.459 --> 00:44:26.916
Syria, all those older
civilizations and much more

00:44:26.916 --> 00:44:29.949
advanced civilizations than the
Greek.

00:44:29.949 --> 00:44:33.516
The Greeks are in touch with
them again and they borrow

00:44:33.516 --> 00:44:36.828
styles, copy styles,
maybe in the early day they

00:44:36.828 --> 00:44:40.890
used some of the craftsmen from
out there or maybe their own

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.990
craftsmen picked it up.
However that may be,

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:46.544
no question about it,
there was contact,

00:44:46.544 --> 00:44:48.510
interaction,
and influence.

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.979
Most of the influence,
I suspect, was going one way in

00:44:51.979 --> 00:44:55.384
those days-from the more
advanced civilization of the

00:44:55.384 --> 00:44:59.758
east to the Greeks.
The Greeks are doing a lot of

00:44:59.758 --> 00:45:03.219
learning, borrowing,
and adopting.

00:45:03.219 --> 00:45:07.732
Of course, this is the period
in which the Homeric epics are

00:45:07.732 --> 00:45:12.321
finally written down now that
there is writing and that gives

00:45:12.321 --> 00:45:16.045
them,
I think, even greater impact on

00:45:16.045 --> 00:45:21.475
the Greek world in the future.
All of these things are

00:45:21.475 --> 00:45:27.723
happening about the same time as
there is a major fundamental

00:45:27.723 --> 00:45:31.776
change in farming,
commerce, and warfare,

00:45:31.776 --> 00:45:35.254
which will have very
significant political

00:45:35.254 --> 00:45:39.699
consequences as well,
but I want to postpone that

00:45:39.699 --> 00:45:43.956
story for a little while.
Let me then just turn to

00:45:43.956 --> 00:45:46.860
this phenomenon that is the
polis.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:54.891
The word polis appears
in Homer, but it means something

00:45:54.891 --> 00:45:59.164
different from what it means
throughout most of Greek

00:45:59.164 --> 00:46:03.026
history.
It just means a physical place,

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:08.408
and what it appears to be is
the citadel, the fortress that

00:46:08.408 --> 00:46:14.440
was the center of the towns that
grew up after the Bronze Age,

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.630
after the collapse of the
Mycenaean world.

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:21.848
So, that's how it is in Homer.
Later definitions,

00:46:21.848 --> 00:46:25.806
however, will be expansive and
broad and as you go further and

00:46:25.806 --> 00:46:29.376
deeper into Greek history,
the claims become greater and

00:46:29.376 --> 00:46:31.478
greater.
Aristotle, in his

00:46:31.478 --> 00:46:35.255
Politics of course,
tells us the most on this

00:46:35.255 --> 00:46:39.179
subject and often he is our
source of information.

00:46:39.179 --> 00:46:41.400
But one thing is clear and
pretty early.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:47.646
The polis is not merely
a city state in the same way as,

00:46:47.646 --> 00:46:52.885
let us say, the Mesopotamian
city states of the third

00:46:52.885 --> 00:46:55.710
millennium B.C.
were.

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:59.772
Places like Ur,
or Kish, towns that we know

00:46:59.772 --> 00:47:04.033
back there.
Those places were simply the

00:47:04.033 --> 00:47:08.432
place where the king or the
emperor ruled,

00:47:08.432 --> 00:47:13.260
the place where the main god's
palace was,

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:17.403
the place where the bureaucrats
were to do their business,

00:47:17.403 --> 00:47:20.610
that's what it was,
no more than that.

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:25.430
But immediately,
very early, you start hearing

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:31.323
the Greeks talk about the
polis in terms that are

00:47:31.323 --> 00:47:38.326
more in your mind than in touch.
Sixth-century Greek poet,

00:47:38.326 --> 00:47:42.774
Alcaeus wrote,
"not houses finally roofed,

00:47:42.774 --> 00:47:46.679
or the stone of walls well
built,

00:47:46.679 --> 00:47:52.608
no not canals or dock yards
make the polis,

00:47:52.608 --> 00:47:57.570
but men able to use their
opportunity."

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:01.988
If you get into the fifth
century, late in the fifth

00:48:01.988 --> 00:48:06.927
century, Thucydides in his
history has one of his generals

00:48:06.927 --> 00:48:12.570
speak to his men and say,
"men are the polis."

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:17.179
So, we need to straighten out
for ourselves what that means?

00:48:17.179 --> 00:48:20.326
Does that mean that the place
where these people live is not

00:48:20.326 --> 00:48:23.280
the polis?
Is it only men?

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:27.348
Well, we'll come back to that.
Let me read you something,

00:48:27.348 --> 00:48:31.641
as we move to the fullest
claims that will be made for the

00:48:31.641 --> 00:48:35.402
role of the polis.
Aristotle in his

00:48:35.402 --> 00:48:40.774
Politics says this:
"as man is the best of the

00:48:40.774 --> 00:48:46.416
animals when perfected,
so he is the worst of all when

00:48:46.416 --> 00:48:50.949
he is divided away from the law
and justice."

00:48:50.949 --> 00:48:54.928
But he tells us,
human justice can be found only

00:48:54.928 --> 00:48:58.230
in the polis,
because he says,

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:03.172
man is by nature a politicon
zoon, an animal of the

00:49:03.172 --> 00:49:06.119
polis,
and as I told you,

00:49:06.119 --> 00:49:10.347
a man who is without a
polis by nature is above

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:15.062
or below the category of man.
It's because man alone has

00:49:15.062 --> 00:49:19.622
the faculty of speech and the
ability to distinguish good from

00:49:19.622 --> 00:49:22.586
bad, and right from wrong.
In addition,

00:49:22.586 --> 00:49:26.168
since he is born with weapons
for the use of wisdom and

00:49:26.168 --> 00:49:29.420
virtue, he may use them for the
opposite ends.

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:34.566
Therefore, when he is without
virtue, man is the most savage

00:49:34.566 --> 00:49:37.809
of animals.
Justice on the other hand,

00:49:37.809 --> 00:49:40.650
is an element of the
polis.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:45.325
The administration of justice,
which means deciding what is

00:49:45.325 --> 00:49:49.679
just, is the regulation of the
partnership which is the

00:49:49.679 --> 00:49:52.748
polis.
Man can't live without the

00:49:52.748 --> 00:49:55.295
polis,
justice exists only in the

00:49:55.295 --> 00:49:58.256
polis,
the polis is something

00:49:58.256 --> 00:50:01.099
more than a place,
it's more than the walls,

00:50:01.099 --> 00:50:05.822
it's more than the ships,
it is some kind of a thing that

00:50:05.822 --> 00:50:08.510
is spiritual it seems to me.

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:20.059
But about the size of this
thing--let me back up.

00:50:20.059 --> 00:50:23.929
There's something else I wanted
to say to indicate this notion

00:50:23.929 --> 00:50:27.990
of men being the polis as
opposed to anything tangible.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.657
When the Persians conquered the
Greek cities of Asia Minor,

00:50:35.657 --> 00:50:39.280
when they came to the coastal
city of Phocaea,

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.550
the Phocians had a choice of
either giving bread and water to

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:47.535
the great king and becoming
subjects of the Persians--all

00:50:47.535 --> 00:50:51.378
they would have had to do was
pay taxes and do military

00:50:51.378 --> 00:50:54.667
service for the king,
since he didn't go about

00:50:54.667 --> 00:50:58.687
killing people he conquered.
The Phocaeans chose instead to

00:50:58.687 --> 00:51:01.212
take their city,
which is to say,

00:51:01.212 --> 00:51:05.534
all the people in the city,
put them on ships,

00:51:05.534 --> 00:51:11.072
sailed to the far west,
and organized a new city out

00:51:11.072 --> 00:51:14.391
there.
In fact, they landed on the

00:51:14.391 --> 00:51:20.030
Riviera in France and did pretty
well for themselves afterwards.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:23.152
But that's a beautiful example;
they thought they had taken

00:51:23.152 --> 00:51:26.935
their polis with them,
because they have had moved the

00:51:26.935 --> 00:51:30.478
entire city there.
During the Persian Wars,

00:51:30.478 --> 00:51:35.471
when the Themistocles is trying
to convince his fellow Greeks to

00:51:35.471 --> 00:51:39.990
stay and fight at Salamis,
but they are reluctant to do,

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:44.050
he says okay if you won't stay
and fight at Salamis,

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:47.725
while all our men are already
located on our ships,

00:51:47.725 --> 00:51:52.546
we will take these ships,
sail them away to Italy,

00:51:52.546 --> 00:51:58.464
and settle an Athens in Italy.
Well, the Spartans take them

00:51:58.464 --> 00:52:02.974
very seriously and they say,
okay we'll stay and fight at

00:52:02.974 --> 00:52:05.708
Salamis.
So, such a concept was a

00:52:05.708 --> 00:52:06.710
possibility.

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:14.240
It's not the whole story though.
Let me turn to the question of

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:18.420
the physical picture that you
ought to have of a polis.

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:22.409
Remember there is that citadel
standing on a high hill;

00:52:22.409 --> 00:52:26.440
the acropolis as it is called,
the polis up high.

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:31.438
There is surrounding farmland
going as far,

00:52:31.438 --> 00:52:37.983
typically, as there is either a
natural or an artificial

00:52:37.983 --> 00:52:41.779
frontier.
Typically, a mountain range

00:52:41.779 --> 00:52:46.943
will be the boundary between the
area of two poleis or a

00:52:46.943 --> 00:52:50.708
stretch of water,
because Greece has the sea

00:52:50.708 --> 00:52:55.155
winding through it everywhere.
But when that's not true,

00:52:55.155 --> 00:52:58.307
then there is a typical sort of
modern frontier,

00:52:58.307 --> 00:53:02.064
a land bridge which there a
line is-a theoretical line is

00:53:02.064 --> 00:53:05.071
drawn through it,
and on one side is one city,

00:53:05.071 --> 00:53:07.039
and the other side is another
city.

00:53:07.039 --> 00:53:12.809
There is a wonderful
archaeological discovery of a

00:53:12.809 --> 00:53:19.993
boundary stone near Athens on
which it is written on one side,

00:53:19.993 --> 00:53:24.349
this is Athens,
it is not Megara.

00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:27.958
On the other side it says,
this is Megara,

00:53:27.958 --> 00:53:31.857
it is not Athens.
So, there is that kind of a

00:53:31.857 --> 00:53:35.322
boundary as well,
and that is a place where

00:53:35.322 --> 00:53:39.613
trouble is likely to emerge.
Once the poleis are in

00:53:39.613 --> 00:53:42.961
place, they will spend a great
deal of time fighting each

00:53:42.961 --> 00:53:46.069
other.
A normal reason for fighting is

00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:50.877
a dispute about a piece of land
that is more or less on the

00:53:50.877 --> 00:53:55.346
boundary between them,
and so that's one aspect of

00:53:55.346 --> 00:53:57.780
their world.
What about how big are

00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.521
these things?
An answer from

00:53:59.521 --> 00:54:02.449
twentieth-century America,
very small.

00:54:02.449 --> 00:54:06.119
I think the word tiny might be
justified.

00:54:06.119 --> 00:54:09.619
We start with the most abnormal
of them in this respect.

00:54:09.619 --> 00:54:13.050
The largest polis,
of which we know,

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:17.153
is Athens.
Unlike many poleis,

00:54:17.153 --> 00:54:24.002
Athens had been successful in
gaining control of the whole

00:54:24.002 --> 00:54:30.130
region which it dominated,
the region of Attica.

00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:34.483
So, anybody by the time history
dawns, who lives in the

00:54:34.483 --> 00:54:37.831
peninsula that is Attica,
is Athenian,

00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:43.688
even if he lives in a village
or a good size town sixty miles

00:54:43.688 --> 00:54:46.260
away;
he is still an Athenian.

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:50.671
He can be a citizen of his
community, he can be a

00:54:50.671 --> 00:54:54.898
Marathonian, but he is also and
more primarily,

00:54:54.898 --> 00:54:58.640
he is an Athenian.
Now Attica is,

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:03.677
in fact, approximately 1,000
square miles,

00:55:03.677 --> 00:55:10.190
which I am told is about the
size of Rhode Island,

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:15.809
and that's the biggest
polis of which we know.

00:55:15.809 --> 00:55:21.179
There are well over a thousand
poleis.

00:55:21.179 --> 00:55:24.351
Some people want to push the
number at its height up to maybe

00:55:24.351 --> 00:55:28.350
1,500, but it doesn't matter.
You're talking about lots and

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:32.958
lots of them.
What is the typical size of

00:55:32.958 --> 00:55:36.083
them?
What is the typical population

00:55:36.083 --> 00:55:38.879
of them?
Well, Aristotle and Plato,

00:55:38.879 --> 00:55:43.395
both sort of theoreticians of
the polis each had an

00:55:43.395 --> 00:55:48.070
idea what's the right size for
the perfect polis.

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:53.629
Aristotle said the right size
is a place where all of the

00:55:53.629 --> 00:55:58.989
citizens, by which he meant the
male adult citizens,

00:55:58.989 --> 00:56:05.987
could come to a central place
and hear a speaker and that

00:56:05.987 --> 00:56:12.110
number comes out to be about
5,000 male adults.

00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:16.946
Plato, being a mathematician,
as Aristotle was not,

00:56:16.946 --> 00:56:22.072
decided that the perfect
polis would have 5,040

00:56:22.072 --> 00:56:26.179
citizens.
Why 5,040, you may ask;

00:56:26.179 --> 00:56:28.129
do we have any mathematicians
among us who will give me a

00:56:28.129 --> 00:56:28.930
quick answer to that?

00:56:40.409 --> 00:56:45.015
Tell me does it mean the same
thing as it has the greatest

00:56:45.015 --> 00:56:48.570
number of numbers that go into
it equally?

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:51.550
That's the answer I heard.
Is that all right?

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:57.699
Okay, enough of this
mathematical falderal.

00:56:57.699 --> 00:56:59.810
As you can see I don't
understand it.

00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:03.548
But look, here's the point.
We're talking about 5,000 adult

00:57:03.548 --> 00:57:05.983
males.
That's the ideal polis

00:57:05.983 --> 00:57:08.469
as far as these guys are
concerned.

00:57:08.469 --> 00:57:10.290
Athens was not the ideal
polis;

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:16.116
it was big.
How many men did it have in its

00:57:16.116 --> 00:57:23.177
fullest bloom?
Somewhere between 40,000 and

00:57:23.177 --> 00:57:27.476
50,000.
It's impossible to have a

00:57:27.476 --> 00:57:33.045
better guess than that.
Then, if you want to say,

00:57:33.045 --> 00:57:38.962
how many human beings lived in
Attica at it greatest,

00:57:38.962 --> 00:57:46.360
we are speaking about something
between a 125,000 and 300,000.

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:51.061
But you have to understand just
from what I've already told you,

00:57:51.061 --> 00:57:56.069
this is extraordinarily large,
and I think you must realize

00:57:56.069 --> 00:58:01.122
that most poleis,
if you're thinking about 1,000

00:58:01.122 --> 00:58:07.110
or more poleis would have
been well under 5,000 adult male

00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:10.737
citizens.
So, I just wanted to give you

00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:15.532
an idea of just how small most
of these places are as well as

00:58:15.532 --> 00:58:20.483
indicating sharp departures.
Okay, now the polis

00:58:20.483 --> 00:58:24.607
from the beginning,
and it never stopped being what

00:58:24.607 --> 00:58:27.658
I'm about to say,
chiefly agricultural

00:58:27.658 --> 00:58:30.972
communities.
Most of the people,

00:58:30.972 --> 00:58:37.112
and I think it's reasonable to
guess that a very high majority

00:58:37.112 --> 00:58:41.340
of the people would be living on
farms,

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:44.515
engaged in farming,
feeding themselves,

00:58:44.515 --> 00:58:49.471
and the rest of the community.
Unlike the ancient near eastern

00:58:49.471 --> 00:58:53.445
cities, these towns do not grow
up around a temple or a

00:58:53.445 --> 00:58:57.260
marketplace,
confluence of rivers as they do

00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:00.686
in medieval Europe.
No, they grow up like the

00:59:00.686 --> 00:59:03.636
Athenian does,
right smack in the middle of a

00:59:03.636 --> 00:59:06.257
plain,
which is a good place for

00:59:06.257 --> 00:59:10.130
farming, with a great high
acropolis available.

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:13.340
Even the characteristic thing
in a polis,

00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:15.800
the agora,
the marketplace,

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:19.714
which also becomes the civic
center of these towns,

00:59:19.714 --> 00:59:23.550
even these grew up later than
the polis.

00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:28.140
They show up a century or more
typically after we know that

00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:32.572
there is a polis there,
and the agora comes

00:59:32.572 --> 00:59:36.384
about in a gradual way.
I think you should never

00:59:36.384 --> 00:59:40.362
imagine in these real old
poleis that got the thing

00:59:40.362 --> 00:59:44.340
started, that somebody said
let's have a polis.

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:47.590
Things just happened;
they just grew up.

00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:51.440
One nice way to think about
it--here Athens is helpful.

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.940
How many of you ever been to
Athens?

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:56.708
Raise your hand.
And the rest of you,

00:59:56.708 --> 01:00:01.804
when you go--on the north
shore--north slope of the

01:00:01.804 --> 01:00:05.250
acropolis,
beyond the agora,

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:09.489
there is the area of Athens
known as the Plaka.

01:00:09.489 --> 01:00:13.368
It's the oldest inhabited area
in Athens, and there you will

01:00:13.368 --> 01:00:16.130
find that unlike the more modern
Athens,

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:21.019
in which streets laid out at
ninety-degree angles perfectly,

01:00:21.019 --> 01:00:24.177
it's a mess.
The streets wind around and

01:00:24.177 --> 01:00:28.248
that's because the original
streets followed the way the

01:00:28.248 --> 01:00:31.800
cattle did their wandering,
looking for food.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.897
These became the roads.
So, I want to stress the sense

01:00:36.897 --> 01:00:41.514
of natural development,
not some kind of a central

01:00:41.514 --> 01:00:45.849
authority making a decision
about anything.

01:00:45.849 --> 01:00:49.947
It is also pretty clear that
for some after the foundation of

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:53.020
the polis,
there were no city walls.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:58.539
These were not defended.
Your farmland was not defended.

01:00:58.539 --> 01:01:02.101
If you had a house outside the
acropolis as you would,

01:01:02.101 --> 01:01:05.815
it was not defended.
What happened if the town was

01:01:05.815 --> 01:01:09.332
attacked, invaded?
Everybody who could ran up to

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:11.880
the acropolis to defend
themselves.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.300
So, that's how things were in
the elementary phase.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:19.139
Now, there are Greek
traditions that are taken

01:01:19.139 --> 01:01:23.684
seriously by the Greeks that
suggest that kings ruled these

01:01:23.684 --> 01:01:28.229
cities from the beginning and
they have lists of kings with

01:01:28.229 --> 01:01:31.914
their names,
and sometimes with stories

01:01:31.914 --> 01:01:34.824
attached to them.
I think myself,

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:40.338
that there were people who had
the title basileus and they were

01:01:40.338 --> 01:01:45.853
noblemen and that they had some
kind of a position of influence

01:01:45.853 --> 01:01:51.716
and authority in the state,
but as I think we have seen

01:01:51.716 --> 01:01:58.530
already, they were not kings in
the oriental sense and once we

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:03.108
have a polis,
it looks as though we don't

01:02:03.108 --> 01:02:06.231
have kings any longer in any
shape, manner,

01:02:06.231 --> 01:02:09.858
or form.
What the kind of regime that

01:02:09.858 --> 01:02:13.369
emerges along side the
polis,

01:02:13.369 --> 01:02:18.685
is an aristocratic republic in
which the noblemen have

01:02:18.685 --> 01:02:24.804
influence and power within the
community by tradition and they

01:02:24.804 --> 01:02:29.309
are plural.
There is not one real king.

01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:33.490
There is typically a council of
aristocrats;

01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:35.320
that is the outfit that counts.

01:02:38.849 --> 01:02:43.212
Hesiod, whom I have not
mentioned to you before,

01:02:43.212 --> 01:02:47.659
a poet who we think to have
lived around 700 B.C.,

01:02:47.659 --> 01:02:52.072
very early in the history of
the polis,

01:02:52.072 --> 01:02:56.659
wrote one of his poems called,
Works and Days.

01:02:56.659 --> 01:03:00.185
This poem offers advice to
farmers on how to live,

01:03:00.185 --> 01:03:04.718
but it also contains a story in
which Hesiod talks about himself

01:03:04.718 --> 01:03:09.107
and the quarrel he has with his
brother over who inherits what

01:03:09.107 --> 01:03:13.183
from the father,
and he claims he's been cheated

01:03:13.183 --> 01:03:18.170
out of his inheritance because
his brother bribed the judges.

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:22.593
Well, who are these judges?
He calls them basileis,

01:03:22.593 --> 01:03:25.905
kings.
These would have been these

01:03:25.905 --> 01:03:30.550
aristocratic figures who we know
in the earliest days of the

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:33.767
polis.
They were the judicial

01:03:33.767 --> 01:03:38.749
authority basing that on their
claim to divine descent on

01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:41.427
their,
certainly, noble descent,

01:03:41.427 --> 01:03:45.183
and on the fact that the
nobility had a monopoly of

01:03:45.183 --> 01:03:49.690
knowledge about what the
traditions of the community are.

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:55.871
So, Hesiod complains about them
and calls them bribe swallowing

01:03:55.871 --> 01:03:58.763
basileis,
crooked ones,

01:03:58.763 --> 01:04:02.989
plural;
kings as in Homer.

01:04:02.989 --> 01:04:07.414
It's also interesting that
Athens has a very clear

01:04:07.414 --> 01:04:10.670
tradition of thinking they had
kings,

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:14.942
and what I think is very
telling is the story they give

01:04:14.942 --> 01:04:18.820
us about how kingship came to an
end in Athens.

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:22.801
Let me start by contrasting it
with what I think is fairly

01:04:22.801 --> 01:04:25.572
typical.
The Romans also had kings,

01:04:25.572 --> 01:04:30.433
I think they had probably real
kings just before the emergence

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:35.295
of their republic and kingship
came to an end according to the

01:04:35.295 --> 01:04:39.716
Roman story,
and the republic succeeded it

01:04:39.716 --> 01:04:44.476
when one of the kings,
the last one Tarquinius

01:04:44.476 --> 01:04:50.610
Superbus (Superbus in Latin
means arrogant) misbehaved,

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:53.576
most seriously,
by raping the daughter of a

01:04:53.576 --> 01:04:57.592
nobleman, Lucretia.
That caused a rebellion and

01:04:57.592 --> 01:05:01.345
they overthrew the kings,
and thereafter,

01:05:01.345 --> 01:05:06.130
the word king was a dirty word
in Roman history.

01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:11.101
The best example is when Julius
Caesar has made himself master

01:05:11.101 --> 01:05:16.400
of Rome, but he's still behaving
as though the republic exists.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.776
People either who want to
embarrass him--well yes,

01:05:20.776 --> 01:05:25.689
I think people who want to
embarrass him send around the

01:05:25.689 --> 01:05:29.619
story Caesar wants to make
himself king.

01:05:29.619 --> 01:05:32.440
The word for king in Latin is
rex.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:37.752
And so, he tried to diffuse
that with a pun by saying,

01:05:37.752 --> 01:05:42.614
Non sum rex said Caesar.
I'm not rex,

01:05:42.614 --> 01:05:45.232
I'm not king,
I'm not rex,

01:05:45.232 --> 01:05:48.425
my name is Caesar.
Well, in fact,

01:05:48.425 --> 01:05:52.689
he pretty well was ready to
turn himself into a king,

01:05:52.689 --> 01:05:57.608
but he wouldn't use that word,
because it had such a terrible

01:05:57.608 --> 01:06:00.945
smell.
Kings were despots,

01:06:00.945 --> 01:06:05.070
dictators, rapists.
You didn't want to be one.

01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:07.750
Well, look at the story the
Athenians tell.

01:06:10.790 --> 01:06:15.170
There was this king of Athens.
Codros was his name.

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:19.980
The Athenians were invaded by
an army from the outside,

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:23.989
and Codros led his forces out
against them.

01:06:23.989 --> 01:06:28.090
He fought brilliantly and
bravely, and drove the enemy

01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:31.648
from the field,
but in the course of the battle

01:06:31.648 --> 01:06:35.630
he himself was killed.
The Athenians loved and

01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:40.599
respected him so much that they
gave him the almost unheard

01:06:40.599 --> 01:06:45.567
honor of burying him right on
the spot where he fell in the

01:06:45.567 --> 01:06:47.874
field,
and thereafter,

01:06:47.874 --> 01:06:52.788
his name was always followed
with glory, admiration and

01:06:52.788 --> 01:06:56.072
devotion.
Well, what kind of story is

01:06:56.072 --> 01:06:58.380
that?
Why do you get rid of a kingdom?

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.889
Why would you get rid a king?
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

01:07:00.889 --> 01:07:02.010
Why did they get rid of the
king?

01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:04.220
Because they thought they could
never have another so good;

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:08.079
so, why try?
Give me a break.

01:07:08.079 --> 01:07:10.854
No, I think somebody had to
make up a story,

01:07:10.854 --> 01:07:14.079
but the memory of kings was not
of a Tarquinius.

01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:19.385
It was not of a brutal despotic
ruler, because they didn't have

01:07:19.385 --> 01:07:22.169
any such thing.
We don't know how the

01:07:22.169 --> 01:07:25.200
change came about or if--some
people question if they ever

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.883
really did have kings,
but the picture I want you to

01:07:27.883 --> 01:07:29.470
have is that's not the
tradition.

01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:34.416
The tradition is aristocracy;
that's what we connect with the

01:07:34.416 --> 01:07:35.972
polis,
and of course,

01:07:35.972 --> 01:07:38.542
it was natural,
because it also fit into the

01:07:38.542 --> 01:07:41.280
world of the Iliad and
the Odyssey,

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.260
which they were accustomed to
think about.

01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:51.239
I think that's a good place to
stop.

01:07:51.239 --> 01:07:55.337
Next time, I will take up the
story of the expansion of the

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:58.799
world of the polis,
which takes the form of

01:07:58.799 --> 01:07:59.799
colonization.

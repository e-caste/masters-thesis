00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.994
Prof: Last time I
lectured under the illusion

00:00:06.994 --> 00:00:09.490
that--
I really should get in the

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.550
habit of looking at the
syllabus--

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.766
that all you had been assigned
for Thursday's lecture was the

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.540
Saussure.
 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.862
Lo and behold,
I did take a glance at the

00:00:18.862 --> 00:00:22.230
syllabus over the weekend and
realized that you'd also been

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.786
assigned the Levi-Strauss,
so we have a little bit of

00:00:25.786 --> 00:00:27.340
ground to cover today.
 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.200
I think we can do it.
 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.420
I think I want to reserve
something like a critique of

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.960
structuralism for the beginning
of Thursday's lecture,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.763
because it segues very nicely
into what we'll have to say

00:00:41.763 --> 00:00:42.850
about Derrida.
 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.516
I already promised that somehow
or another the critique of

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:49.090
structuralism just was
deconstruction.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.640
I hope to be able to
demonstrate that on Thursday;

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.232
but I do want to get up to the
point of launching a critique of

00:00:57.232 --> 00:01:00.270
structuralism on two or three
grounds,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.170
and so I hope to be able to
move along fairly quickly today.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.739
Now another thing that got left
out,

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:12.230
even given the proviso that it
was only about Saussure on

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.091
Thursday,
was an adequate account of the

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:19.247
relationship between synchrony
and diachrony and the pivotal

00:01:19.247 --> 00:01:24.101
importance of this concept,
not only for semiotics but for

00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:28.854
its aftermath in structuralism,
and also for its relation to

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:31.861
the Russian formalists;
because you remember that in

00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:35.937
talking about function,
the formalists who undertook to

00:01:35.937 --> 00:01:40.953
think about literary history and
the problems of literary

00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:46.060
historiography were very much
engaged in the notion that a

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.435
function in a given text could
be understood in two different

00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:52.510
ways.
 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.799
There was the syn-function,
which was the relationship

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.399
between that function and all of
the other functions in the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.105
text--
in other words,

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:03.640
viewed as an aspect of that
text,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.870
but there was also of the same
function its auto-function,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.340
which is the way in which it
persists and recurs throughout

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.580
the history of literature
sometimes as the dominant,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.491
sometimes latent or recessive,
but always in one form or

00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:23.919
another there.
 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.964
Now in Saussurian linguistics,
the relationship between

00:02:27.964 --> 00:02:31.560
synchrony and diachrony is very
much the same.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.144
To consider language in
toto is to consider it at a

00:02:38.144 --> 00:02:41.610
given moment synchronically.
 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.983
That is to say,
you don't think of language as

00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:49.405
a system if at the same time
you're thinking of it unfolding

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:50.680
historically.
 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.032
Jakobson, you will notice,
introduces an element of time

00:02:55.032 --> 00:03:00.020
into the synchronic analysis of
a semiotic system by saying that

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.453
you've got to take account both
of archaic and innovative

00:03:04.453 --> 00:03:07.834
features,
but nevertheless they are

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:12.908
simply flagged as archaic or
innovative and not understood as

00:03:12.908 --> 00:03:17.307
changing in time as long as they
are read or analyzed

00:03:17.307 --> 00:03:19.000
synchronically.
 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.447
But at the same token,
a system does change through

00:03:23.447 --> 00:03:24.068
time.
 

00:03:24.068 --> 00:03:27.443
A semiotic system,
language, the history of

00:03:27.443 --> 00:03:29.458
literature,
the history of

00:03:29.458 --> 00:03:33.190
poetics--whatever it might be,
changes through time,

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.562
and to analyze that change
through time you think of it

00:03:37.562 --> 00:03:39.020
diachronically.
 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.574
Now Saussure argues that the
relationship among the parts of

00:03:44.574 --> 00:03:47.870
something viewed
synchronically--

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.065
a semiotic system,
let's say--are not necessary in

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:55.370
the sense that they might be any
number of other relationships,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.628
but they are nevertheless fixed.
 

00:03:57.628 --> 00:04:00.061
That is to say,
they are what's there and they

00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:02.060
can't be other than what they
are,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.621
whereas through time,
if you're studying a semiotic

00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:09.538
system or studying language or
whatever it might be,

00:04:09.538 --> 00:04:12.658
change takes place and it's
necessary.

00:04:12.658 --> 00:04:14.342
You're looking back on it and
it simply did happen,

00:04:14.342 --> 00:04:15.150
&gt;
 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.180
so change is determinant in
some sense.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.959
But at the same time,
it's not regular.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.601
This, by the way,
is a challenge to certain ideas

00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:26.023
in traditional linguistics like,
for example,

00:04:26.023 --> 00:04:29.160
the one you probably all know:
the great vowel shift.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.059
A structuralist's view of
language has to argue that the

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:38.274
great vowel shift,
in which every vowel sound goes

00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:42.810
up a notch in some mysterious
period between the medieval and

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.233
the early modern,
that this only has the

00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:51.233
appearance of regularity but
that it is actually a diachronic

00:04:51.233 --> 00:04:55.065
phenomenon that can't be
understood in terms of

00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:56.399
regularity.
 

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:59.730
So the relationship between
synchronic and diachronic is of

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.420
that kind.
 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.584
Now matters are complicated a
little bit on those occasions in

00:05:05.584 --> 00:05:10.665
your reading when people are
talking about the way in which a

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:15.312
mass of material--
a system of language or other

00:05:15.312 --> 00:05:19.601
semiotic system,
let's say--is inferred from

00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:22.639
existing data:
in other words,

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.379
the way in which I infer
language, langue,

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.091
from a sentence,
parole--I'm actually

00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:36.529
concealing from you that in fact
Saussure uses a third term,

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:38.617
langage,
to talk about the sum of all

00:05:38.617 --> 00:05:41.254
sentences,
but we won't get into that--the

00:05:41.254 --> 00:05:44.750
way in which language is
inferred from parole.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.531
Now language,
in other words,

00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:48.759
is viewed as something in
space,

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.730
that is to say--or as
Levi-Strauss calls it,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.538
"revertible time,"
meaning you can go backward and

00:05:54.538 --> 00:05:57.220
forward within it,
but the temporal unfolding is

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.190
not the important thing about
it.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.430
So in space,
whereas parole,

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.069
speech, unfolds in time so
that parole,

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:10.439
because it is temporal--because
any speech any of us makes is in

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:14.076
a certain sense historical,
* because the

00:06:14.076 --> 00:06:17.245
beginning of the sentence is
earlier in history than the end

00:06:17.245 --> 00:06:19.254
of the sentence--
for that reason,

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:22.757
there's a relationship between
diachrony and the unfolding of

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.946
parole,
or of a sentence or of an

00:06:25.946 --> 00:06:30.113
utterance which is parallel,
though at the same time

00:06:30.113 --> 00:06:31.649
admittedly confusing.
 

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:36.690
One doesn't really want to talk
about a sentence as diachronic,

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.187
but at the same time it does
exist on that horizontal axis in

00:06:42.187 --> 00:06:46.860
which things in a combinatory
way unfold in time.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.759
All right.
 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.110
So much then for synchrony and
diachrony, something we can't

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.290
get away from.
 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.884
It's in a way the central fact
of structuralism but which I

00:06:57.884 --> 00:07:02.163
don't think I did adequate
justice to at the end of the

00:07:02.163 --> 00:07:03.509
last lecture.
 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:05.319
Now structuralism.
 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:11.286
There was an incredible aura
about structuralism in the

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:12.170
1960s.
 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.781
It crashed on the shores of the
United States coming in from

00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:20.845
France in a way that stunned,
amazed, and transformed

00:07:20.845 --> 00:07:22.329
people's lives.
 

00:07:22.329 --> 00:07:27.416
People like Kant reading Hume
woke up from their dogmatic

00:07:27.416 --> 00:07:30.403
slumbers or,
at least, that they felt that

00:07:30.403 --> 00:07:33.819
that's what they were doing when
encountering structuralism.

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:36.838
I think to me it happened when
I was a graduate student at

00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:40.067
Harvard and absolutely nobody
else was paying any attention to

00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:40.810
it at all.
 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.033
At Yale, Johns Hopkins,
and Cornell people were paying

00:07:44.033 --> 00:07:46.798
attention to it,
but at Harvard I was initiated

00:07:46.798 --> 00:07:49.906
to structuralism by a bright
undergraduate who seemed to be

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:51.730
the only &gt;
 

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.990
person in Cambridge who knew
anything about structuralism.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.521
Boy, did he know about
structuralism,

00:07:57.521 --> 00:08:01.110
and he got me up to speed as
quickly as he could;

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.827
but it was a phenomenon that
was transformative

00:08:04.827 --> 00:08:09.355
intellectually for people in the
academic, and beyond the

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:12.670
academic, world all over the
country.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.553
Of course it led,
in all sorts of ways,

00:08:15.553 --> 00:08:19.730
to most of what's been going on
in theory ever since.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.197
The amazing thing about it is
that as a flourishing and

00:08:23.197 --> 00:08:26.600
undisputed French contribution
to literary theory,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.519
it lasted two years because in
1966 at a famous conference,

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:34.489
Jacques Derrida,
whom we'll be reading on

00:08:34.489 --> 00:08:38.539
Thursday,
blew it out of the water.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.700
I'll come back to that.
 

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.392
At the same time,
to say that it really only

00:08:44.392 --> 00:08:47.570
lasted two years simply isn't
fair.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.599
The lasting contribution of
structuralism as it's indebted

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:55.052
to semiotics,
but on its own terms as well,

00:08:55.052 --> 00:08:59.697
is something one still feels
and senses throughout literary

00:08:59.697 --> 00:09:00.500
theory.
 

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.754
The concrete contributions,
not all between 1964 when the

00:09:04.754 --> 00:09:09.316
first structuralist texts were
translated in this country and

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:13.418
1966 when the conference in
Baltimore took place,

00:09:13.418 --> 00:09:17.278
but the lasting concrete
contributions are also terribly

00:09:17.278 --> 00:09:18.120
important.
 

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.927
There's a wonderful book called
On Racine by Roland

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:21.418
Barthes.
 

00:09:21.418 --> 00:09:25.081
Those of you interested in
French neoclassical theater

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:28.259
cannot imagine,
if you haven't read it already,

00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:30.470
reading a more bracing book.
 

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.488
There is an essay on
Baudelaire, "Les

00:09:33.488 --> 00:09:37.537
Chats," or "The
Cats," written conjointly

00:09:37.537 --> 00:09:41.782
by Levi-Strauss and Jakobson,
an extraordinary performance

00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:45.452
which was the model of a good
deal else that was done in the

00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:47.320
academy during that period.
 

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.038
The anthropologist Edmund Leach
wrote a structuralist analysis

00:09:52.038 --> 00:09:54.048
of Genesis in the Bible.
 

00:09:54.048 --> 00:09:57.864
Indeed, it's no accident that
he writes about Genesis,

00:09:57.864 --> 00:10:00.240
as I will indicate in a minute.
 

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.370
Then subsequently,
and in addition to all of that,

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.932
probably the most lasting and
rich contributions of the

00:10:07.932 --> 00:10:12.090
structuralists were in the field
that we know as narratology.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.947
We'll be taking a look at that
when we read Peter Brooks' text

00:10:15.947 --> 00:10:19.490
in conjunction with Freud a
couple of weeks from now,

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.330
but in the meantime the key
texts in narratology are,

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.629
again, by Roland Barthes in a
long,

00:10:25.629 --> 00:10:30.580
long essay called "The
Structural Analysis of

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.125
Narrative"
in which he approaches a James

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:40.783
Bond novel as a system of binary
pairs and unpacks a deep

00:10:40.783 --> 00:10:47.350
structure in the novel as a
result of this binary analysis;

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.529
important books by Tzvetan
Todorov,

00:10:50.529 --> 00:10:53.173
crucial among them The
Grammar of The

00:10:53.173 --> 00:10:56.952
Decameron;
and then a good deal of work

00:10:56.952 --> 00:11:00.352
published in a series of books
called Figures by

00:11:00.352 --> 00:11:04.240
Gérard Genette,
whom you will find quoted

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.101
repeatedly in the work of Paul
de Man that you'll be reading

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:10.750
for next Tuesday.
 

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.440
All of this work and a great
deal else in the theory of

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.443
narrative,
narratology,

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:21.618
is directly indebted to,
or is actually an aspect of,

00:11:21.618 --> 00:11:23.490
structuralist thought.
 

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:28.229
Now I promised that I would
talk a little bit about the

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:33.407
relationship between formalism
and semiotics as it clarifies

00:11:33.407 --> 00:11:38.409
itself in the work of writers
like Levi-Strauss and,

00:11:38.409 --> 00:11:39.980
in particular, Jakobson.
 

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.258
Structuralism takes from
formalism, as you can see from

00:11:45.258 --> 00:11:49.558
Jakobson's analysis,
the idea of function.

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:53.780
Jakobson is originally,
of course, himself a member of

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.570
the school of Russian
formalists.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:00.139
He eventually immigrates to
Prague,

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:03.288
where he is in a circle of
people who are already calling

00:12:03.288 --> 00:12:06.673
themselves structuralists,
and moves from there to Paris

00:12:06.673 --> 00:12:08.548
and then to the United States.
 

00:12:08.548 --> 00:12:11.937
So Jakobson,
of course, is the one figure

00:12:11.937 --> 00:12:16.682
who definitely harkens back to
both worlds, having been a

00:12:16.682 --> 00:12:20.750
formalist and having become a
structuralist.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:27.246
One can see the amalgam of
these two sets of ideas in his

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:28.058
work.
 

00:12:28.058 --> 00:12:32.479
From formalism then,
you get the idea of function

00:12:32.479 --> 00:12:38.279
and the relationship between
syn-function and auto-function,

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:42.899
which becomes the relationship
between synchrony and diachrony.

00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:47.360
From semiotics you get the idea
of negative knowledge--

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.212
that is to say,
in Levi-Strauss' analysis of

00:12:50.212 --> 00:12:52.058
the Oedipus myth,
for example,

00:12:52.058 --> 00:12:53.918
the notion that there is no
true version,

00:12:53.918 --> 00:12:58.279
there's no originary version,
and there's no sort of positive

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:02.639
version of the myth of which
everything else is a version.

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:07.163
You simply know what you know
as it is differentiated from the

00:13:07.163 --> 00:13:11.629
other things that you know--
one of the essential premises

00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:14.210
of semiotics,
which is essential,

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.376
at the same time,
in structuralism,

00:13:17.376 --> 00:13:22.618
because here's where
structuralism can be understood

00:13:22.618 --> 00:13:25.288
as an entity in itself.
 

00:13:25.288 --> 00:13:29.556
Unlike formalism,
structuralism has an ambition

00:13:29.556 --> 00:13:34.655
with respect to the object,
to the nature of the object,

00:13:34.655 --> 00:13:36.788
which is quite new.
 

00:13:36.788 --> 00:13:41.082
I think that the best way to
epitomize that is to turn to an

00:13:41.082 --> 00:13:44.649
aphorism of Roland Barthes' in
the essay "The

00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:48.870
Structuralist Activity,"
on page 871 toward the bottom

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.796
of the right-hand column,
where Barthes says,

00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:55.990
"Structural man takes the
real,

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:01.139
decomposes it,
then recomposes it..."

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:04.294
This is the moment in which you
can see the radical difference

00:14:04.294 --> 00:14:07.192
between what structuralism is
doing and what formalism is

00:14:07.192 --> 00:14:07.710
doing.
 

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.730
Formalism takes the object and
it doesn't decompose it.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.789
It sees the object as it is;
it just breaks it down into its

00:14:17.789 --> 00:14:22.326
respective functions,
showing them dynamically in

00:14:22.326 --> 00:14:28.052
relationship with each other and
as a system of dominance and

00:14:28.052 --> 00:14:32.585
subordination,
all of it understood as the way

00:14:32.585 --> 00:14:36.610
in which something is made,
the way in which it is put

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.480
together--
but there's no question of

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.288
anything other than the object.
 

00:14:42.288 --> 00:14:45.259
Gogol's "Overcoat,"
Cervantes' Don Quixote,

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.999
Sterne's Tristam
Shandy: these are

00:14:47.999 --> 00:14:49.993
objects,
and there's no question of

00:14:49.993 --> 00:14:52.529
somehow or another creating a
virtual object,

00:14:52.529 --> 00:14:56.600
for example "the
novel," out of one's

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.519
remarks about individual texts.
 

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:01.580
In a way, though,
that's what,

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.417
as you can see again from
Levi-Strauss' analysis of the

00:15:05.417 --> 00:15:08.330
Oedipus myth,
structuralism is doing.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.234
As Barthes says,
"Structural man takes the

00:15:11.234 --> 00:15:12.860
real,
decomposes it,

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.342
then recomposes
itâ€¦"

00:15:15.342 --> 00:15:20.148
What he means by that is that
you take a bunch of variants or

00:15:20.148 --> 00:15:23.586
versions,
you take a bunch of data--not

00:15:23.586 --> 00:15:28.232
necessarily all the data,
but a representative amount of

00:15:28.232 --> 00:15:32.418
the data relevant to any given
idea or concept--

00:15:32.418 --> 00:15:37.926
and then you say,
and this is where he gets into

00:15:37.926 --> 00:15:44.956
the idea of gross constituent
units: "What are the basic

00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:51.049
constituent units of all of
these items of data?

00:15:51.049 --> 00:15:52.610
Oh, yeah.
 

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.460
I see we can put them into a
pattern."

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.600
We'll work on this a little bit
in a minute.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.649
"Yeah, I see how this is
working.

00:15:59.649 --> 00:16:03.730
As a matter of fact,
there is a kind of virtual

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:08.697
object that I can begin to
observe as I organize the data

00:16:08.697 --> 00:16:13.754
that I garner from all the
individual entities or versions

00:16:13.754 --> 00:16:17.480
that fall under this
umbrella."

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:24.278
That's the recomposition not of
any particular object,

00:16:24.278 --> 00:16:29.149
but of a kind of virtual object
which begins to emerge from

00:16:29.149 --> 00:16:32.759
one's analysis:
in the case of Levi-Strauss'

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:37.740
text,
the meaning of the Oedipus myth.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:44.285
That's the virtual object that
structuralist analysis arrives

00:16:44.285 --> 00:16:49.019
at by arranging,
analyzing and classifying the

00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:54.611
data that it can get from all of
the available versions of the

00:16:54.611 --> 00:16:56.080
Oedipus myth.
 

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:01.177
So structuralism decomposes but
not just for the sake of seeing

00:17:01.177 --> 00:17:06.191
how something works,
like taking apart the parts of

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:11.656
an engine,
but rather in order to lend the

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:19.277
parts to an analysis of a body
of materials that makes it

00:17:19.277 --> 00:17:26.896
possible to recompose all of
those parts in a new virtual

00:17:26.896 --> 00:17:28.528
object.
 

00:17:28.528 --> 00:17:31.192
That's what's going on in what
Barthes calls "the

00:17:31.192 --> 00:17:32.750
structuralist activity."
 

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:37.759
So quickly let's take a look at
the Levi-Strauss chart,

00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:43.094
if you want to call it that,
of the Oedipus myth which is on

00:17:43.094 --> 00:17:48.519
page 864 in your text and just
say a word or two about it.

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:50.298
He takes a lot of versions.
 

00:17:50.298 --> 00:17:52.730
Let's not trouble ourselves
with how many.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.744
He doesn't have nearly as many
versions by the way as he would

00:17:56.744 --> 00:18:00.630
have if he were studying a North
American Indian myth or the

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.711
sorts of myths that he did study
in a variety of versions as an

00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:08.190
anthropologist,
but he has some versions--one

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.541
of them,
by the way, Freud's version,

00:18:10.541 --> 00:18:15.338
one of them Sophocles' version,
and a variety of versions

00:18:15.338 --> 00:18:17.048
besides those.
 

00:18:17.048 --> 00:18:19.519
He says, "Hmm,
as you look at these various

00:18:19.519 --> 00:18:22.200
versions [gestures towards graph
on chalkboard],

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.788
you can see that certain things
are basically happening,

00:18:24.788 --> 00:18:29.160
and they fall into certain
discrete categories.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.098
We can put them in
columns--that is to say,

00:18:33.098 --> 00:18:38.288
in terms of the way in which
they share a common theme,

00:18:38.288 --> 00:18:43.890
but we can also put those
columns in a row so that we can

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:48.890
analyze the way in which the
columns relate to each

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.490
other."
 

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.338
For example,
there's a group of events,

00:18:53.338 --> 00:18:58.897
happenstances,
sort of naming accidents and so

00:18:58.897 --> 00:19:01.794
on,
that falls into a column called

00:19:01.794 --> 00:19:05.338
"over-determination of
blood relations."

00:19:05.338 --> 00:19:08.940
That is to say,
when Antigone tries to bury her

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.150
brother and goes to the wall for
that,

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.230
in ways that you might find
excessive,

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:18.348
that's an over-determination of
blood relations.

00:19:18.348 --> 00:19:21.380
Then you notice that at the
same time,

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.838
there's a series of actions in
the myth--

00:19:23.838 --> 00:19:27.265
going all the way back to
Oedipus' family history and then

00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:30.568
down through the history of his
offspring and so on--

00:19:30.568 --> 00:19:34.778
a series of actions which have
to do with the undervaluation of

00:19:34.778 --> 00:19:36.000
blood relations.
 

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.719
People, well,
they don't really seem to care

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:42.702
as much about blood relations as
they should, and as a result of

00:19:42.702 --> 00:19:44.788
that, bad things happen,
too.

00:19:44.788 --> 00:19:51.487
Then there's a column of issues
which have to do with the way in

00:19:51.487 --> 00:19:55.250
which recurrently,
in all of the versions of the

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.642
myth,
there seems to be a strange

00:19:57.642 --> 00:20:01.536
preoccupation with that which is
born from the earth:

00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:05.432
monsters,
the teeth of monsters that are

00:20:05.432 --> 00:20:11.180
scattered and become the
alphabet in the story of Cadmos,

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:15.657
and the variety of ways in
which heroes have to confront

00:20:15.657 --> 00:20:19.160
monsters as Oedipus confronts
the sphinx.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.582
All of these monsters are
understood as not being born

00:20:23.582 --> 00:20:26.753
from parents,
or as being born from two

00:20:26.753 --> 00:20:31.009
things, but instead as emerging
from the earth.

00:20:31.009 --> 00:20:35.325
They are thonic,
or "autochthonous"

00:20:35.325 --> 00:20:37.680
in Levi-Strauss' word.
 

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.200
There seems to be a strange
preoccupation with autochthony

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:49.261
in this myth,
but this is offset by the way

00:20:49.261 --> 00:20:52.675
in which--
that is to say,

00:20:52.675 --> 00:20:58.105
with fending off autochthony,
as if the crucial thing were to

00:20:58.105 --> 00:21:03.940
insist on the binary parental
relationship that produces us,

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:09.915
to be reassured in our humanity
by the idea that one of us is

00:21:09.915 --> 00:21:11.509
born from two.
 

00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:14.935
But then on the other hand,
there are all kinds of things

00:21:14.935 --> 00:21:18.423
in the myth which are also
preoccupied with autochthony in

00:21:18.423 --> 00:21:20.318
precisely the opposite way.
 

00:21:20.318 --> 00:21:24.682
Lambda, the letter that begins
so many of the names of the

00:21:24.682 --> 00:21:28.903
figures in Oedipus' genealogy--
Labdacus, Laius and so

00:21:28.903 --> 00:21:32.519
on--lambda looks like a limping
person, right?

00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:35.996
Oedipus means "swell
foot," "one who

00:21:35.996 --> 00:21:36.970
limps."
 

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:42.508
What emerges in the fourth
column is the idea that there

00:21:42.508 --> 00:21:47.038
are signs of autochthony in our
own makeup.

00:21:47.038 --> 00:21:50.410
The reason we limp is that we
have a foot of clay,

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.538
that something of the earth
from which we were born sticks

00:21:54.538 --> 00:21:56.863
to us,
and this is a recurrent

00:21:56.863 --> 00:22:01.730
pattern, a recurrent idea,
in the unfolding of the Oedipus

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:02.278
myth.
 

00:22:02.278 --> 00:22:05.905
It's a peculiar thing,
but notice that this is one of

00:22:05.905 --> 00:22:09.532
those occasions on which the
myth explodes into other

00:22:09.532 --> 00:22:10.440
cultures.
 

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.519
Adam means "red clay."
 

00:22:13.519 --> 00:22:19.150
Adam is born from the earth in
the sense that red clay is taken

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.420
from the earth and he is
created,

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:27.484
and there seems to be this same
preoccupation with autochthony

00:22:27.484 --> 00:22:32.474
in the Oedipus myth as well,
one of the interesting links of

00:22:32.474 --> 00:22:36.838
that myth with the Christian
myth of the origin of man.

00:22:36.838 --> 00:22:40.464
So you've got four columns:
over-evaluation of blood

00:22:40.464 --> 00:22:42.592
relations,
under-evaluation of blood

00:22:42.592 --> 00:22:44.583
relations,
denial of autochthony,

00:22:44.583 --> 00:22:46.640
and persistence of autochthony.
 

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.028
I'm going to leave it at that
for now because we'll come back

00:22:51.028 --> 00:22:55.414
later to see what interesting
thing is going on in the way in

00:22:55.414 --> 00:22:59.871
which these four columns,
all about two versus one:

00:22:59.871 --> 00:23:04.473
that is to say,
whether or not we are born from

00:23:04.473 --> 00:23:06.650
two or born from one.
 

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:12.101
I want to come back to that in
the context of showing that in a

00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:15.554
certain way,
the question of whether

00:23:15.554 --> 00:23:19.124
things--ideas,
for example--come from two,

00:23:19.124 --> 00:23:23.952
two different things,
or whether ideas come from one

00:23:23.952 --> 00:23:26.922
object,
is after all this question is

00:23:26.922 --> 00:23:30.460
itself an allegory of the
structuralist activity.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.430
That's what structuralism
itself is about.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.347
That's what makes it so
interesting and even perhaps

00:23:37.347 --> 00:23:41.496
peculiar that Levi-Strauss is
able to find not just any

00:23:41.496 --> 00:23:45.875
thought in a myth but the very
thinking that he himself is

00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:47.950
doing about the myth.
 

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.038
That, of course,
may have something to do with

00:23:51.038 --> 00:23:54.130
your sense that surely
decomposing in order to

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:58.527
recompose,
creating a virtual systemic

00:23:58.527 --> 00:24:01.980
object--
notice that I have made this a

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.400
dotted line [gestures towards
chalkboard]--

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.778
that there is a kind of a
circularity in that.

00:24:07.778 --> 00:24:11.161
I hope I have explained
Levi-Strauss' four columns

00:24:11.161 --> 00:24:13.714
intelligibly,
but if you look at those

00:24:13.714 --> 00:24:15.509
&gt;
 

00:24:15.509 --> 00:24:18.278
four columns you say to
yourself, "How on earth did

00:24:18.278 --> 00:24:19.740
he come up with that?"
 

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.811
He himself says, "Oh,
well, maybe I could have done

00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:27.720
it some other way,"
and you say to yourself,

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.640
"How can this become
decisive?

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.720
How can it become
authoritative?"

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.430
Right?
 

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.881
You can see what he's
doing--and by the way you can

00:24:35.881 --> 00:24:38.529
confirm it by thinking of things
that he leaves out.

00:24:38.529 --> 00:24:41.279
Jocasta hangs herself,
but he doesn't mention that.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:43.029
It's not in any of the four
columns,

00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:44.838
but obviously that has
something to do--

00:24:44.838 --> 00:24:47.500
you can take your
choice--either between the

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.532
over-determination or
under-determination of blood

00:24:50.532 --> 00:24:51.400
relations.
 

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.674
She feels guilty because she
committed incest,

00:24:53.674 --> 00:24:54.078
right?
 

00:24:54.078 --> 00:24:59.257
Oedipus at his birth is
hamstrung and exposed on Mount

00:24:59.257 --> 00:25:00.430
Cithaeron.
 

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.435
Levi-Strauss doesn't mention
that either, but obviously

00:25:03.435 --> 00:25:04.940
that's why Oedipus limps.
 

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.172
Oedipus is a limping person
like the letter lambda,

00:25:08.172 --> 00:25:08.690
right?
 

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.931
So plainly that must have
something to do with the

00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:13.848
persistence of autochthony.
 

00:25:13.848 --> 00:25:16.688
Finally, if you read Oedipus
at Colonus,

00:25:16.688 --> 00:25:19.032
at the end of it Oedipus,
when he dies,

00:25:19.032 --> 00:25:22.359
is swallowed up by the earth;
"dust thou art,

00:25:22.359 --> 00:25:24.490
to dust thou shalt
return."

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:29.326
The equivalent of this in the
Oedipus myth is that "where

00:25:29.326 --> 00:25:33.368
I came from [the earth]
is where I will go."

00:25:33.368 --> 00:25:38.130
He becomes a kind of genius of
the place at Colonus.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:42.546
As a result of having been
swallowed up there,

00:25:42.546 --> 00:25:48.730
he becomes a kind of presiding
spirit or genius of the place.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.328
So all of those things which we
ourselves thought of--

00:25:52.328 --> 00:25:55.598
he didn't think of them and he
didn't put them in his diagram--

00:25:55.598 --> 00:25:58.910
can, however,
be put in his diagram.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.601
If that's the case,
we have to say to ourselves,

00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:03.950
"There might be something
in this.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:08.383
Maybe this is a plausible and
interesting way of arranging

00:26:08.383 --> 00:26:10.250
these materials."
 

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.741
So I really do think that ought
to be said in defense of what

00:26:14.741 --> 00:26:18.036
may seem, however,
to be a somewhat arbitrary

00:26:18.036 --> 00:26:19.009
exercise.
 

00:26:19.009 --> 00:26:22.251
Now turning to Jakobson,
you may say with all this

00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:26.155
emphasis I've been throwing on
"decomposing in order to

00:26:26.155 --> 00:26:29.067
recompose"
that you don't see that going

00:26:29.067 --> 00:26:31.450
on in what Jakobson is saying.
 

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.455
You may say to yourself,
"Well, he seems to be just

00:26:34.455 --> 00:26:35.440
doing formalism.
 

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.078
He breaks any speech act into
six functions.

00:26:40.078 --> 00:26:44.353
He talks about the
inter-determinacy of those six

00:26:44.353 --> 00:26:47.380
functions with a certain result.
 

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.559
That sounds just like
formalism,"

00:26:49.559 --> 00:26:50.150
you say.
 

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:54.117
Well, one way to show the way
in which what Jakobson is doing

00:26:54.117 --> 00:26:58.019
is structuralist is to say that
after all in this essay--

00:26:58.019 --> 00:27:00.519
there's a lot more of the
essay, by the way,

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:01.980
which your editor doesn't give
you.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.945
It's mostly about
versification,

00:27:03.945 --> 00:27:07.435
which is the long-standing
specialty of Jakobson's work:

00:27:07.435 --> 00:27:11.778
Russian versification,
Czech versification and so on,

00:27:11.778 --> 00:27:16.221
a little technical,
but it is all about the poetic

00:27:16.221 --> 00:27:17.088
function.
 

00:27:17.088 --> 00:27:19.970
After all, this essay is about
the poetic function,

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.618
what the formalists would call
literariness.

00:27:22.618 --> 00:27:26.407
But Jakobson has a real
contribution to make to this

00:27:26.407 --> 00:27:30.685
notion of the poetic function,
and what it is is basically

00:27:30.685 --> 00:27:34.064
this: the poetic function--
and I'm going to quote this for

00:27:34.064 --> 00:27:34.828
the first time.
 

00:27:34.828 --> 00:27:39.592
It's on page 858 in the
left-hand column and it's a

00:27:39.592 --> 00:27:40.640
mouthful.
 

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.952
"The poetic function
projects the principle of

00:27:44.952 --> 00:27:49.612
equivalence from the axis of
selection into the axis of

00:27:49.612 --> 00:27:51.509
combination."
 

00:27:51.509 --> 00:27:52.588
Now you understand.
 

00:27:52.588 --> 00:27:55.911
"The poetic function
projects the principle of

00:27:55.911 --> 00:27:59.498
equivalence from the axis of
selection into the axis of

00:27:59.498 --> 00:28:00.960
combination."
 

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.650
What is the principle of
equivalence?

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.950
If you've got that,
you've got a good deal of it.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.096
The principle of equivalence
can be understood as what

00:28:08.096 --> 00:28:10.114
Jakobson in the
"aphasia"

00:28:10.114 --> 00:28:12.013
essay calls
"metaphor,"

00:28:12.013 --> 00:28:14.328
that is to say the way in
which--

00:28:14.328 --> 00:28:19.090
you remember last time I talked
about how signs cluster in the

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.759
vertical axis [gestures towards
chalkboard],

00:28:22.759 --> 00:28:24.720
and if we understand language
as a system,

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.354
there are some signs that
relate to other signs in ways

00:28:27.354 --> 00:28:29.940
that they probably don't relate
to yet other signs.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.318
Then I had an incredible lapse
of memory.

00:28:32.318 --> 00:28:35.861
I couldn't remember a synonym
for "ship,"

00:28:35.861 --> 00:28:40.251
but I hope that I got my point
across to you and indicated that

00:28:40.251 --> 00:28:44.431
there are varieties of ways in
which any given sign clusters

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:46.058
with other signs.
 

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:50.278
Those ways of clustering are
what Jakobson calls "the

00:28:50.278 --> 00:28:52.720
principle of equivalence."
 

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.910
What is it?
 

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:58.259
Well, it's the way in which
signs either are similar to each

00:28:58.259 --> 00:29:01.210
other or are dissimilar to each
other.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.700
If that sounds too vague,
maybe it's better not to use

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.321
language of difference or
similarity but actually to use

00:29:08.321 --> 00:29:11.220
language of opposition:
in other words,

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.210
the way in which signs are
virtually synonymous,

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:18.434
or the way in which signs are
really and truly opposed to each

00:29:18.434 --> 00:29:18.990
other.
 

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.339
Obviously, it stretches just as
in versification.

00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:26.348
You don't just have full rhyme;
you have slant rhyme.

00:29:26.348 --> 00:29:32.390
These relationships stretch in
varieties of ways of this kind,

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:37.188
but the principle of
equivalence is the way in which

00:29:37.188 --> 00:29:42.107
signs understood as phonemes,
lexemes, tagmemes--how ever you

00:29:42.107 --> 00:29:46.627
want to understand them--
the way in which signs are

00:29:46.627 --> 00:29:49.210
similar or dissimilar.
 

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:54.756
The readiness with which we
combine signs of that kind is

00:29:54.756 --> 00:30:00.598
what a person attending to the
poetic function looks for.

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:06.821
If the utterance seems to
involve a predominance of

00:30:06.821 --> 00:30:12.468
equivalences of various kinds,
then this utterance,

00:30:12.468 --> 00:30:16.160
which is unfolding on the axis
of combination,

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.528
right [gestures towards
chalkboard], is the result of

00:30:19.528 --> 00:30:22.769
having projected that principle
of equivalence--

00:30:22.769 --> 00:30:25.838
call it metaphor,
call it a principle of

00:30:25.838 --> 00:30:31.118
similarity or dissimilarity--
from the axis of selection;

00:30:31.118 --> 00:30:34.362
that is to say,
that axis, perhaps a virtual

00:30:34.362 --> 00:30:37.943
one,
in which language is a system

00:30:37.943 --> 00:30:42.808
to the axis of combination,
that real axis--because nobody

00:30:42.808 --> 00:30:46.414
doubts the existence of speech--
that real axis in which

00:30:46.414 --> 00:30:51.048
language is not a system but has
become speech unfolding in time.

00:30:51.048 --> 00:30:55.676
The principle of the poetic
function, however,

00:30:55.676 --> 00:31:01.332
can be understood then as the
metaphorization of what is

00:31:01.332 --> 00:31:03.798
otherwise metonymic.
 

00:31:03.798 --> 00:31:06.269
In other words,
if I put together a sentence,

00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:09.303
what I'm doing is I'm putting
words next to each other,

00:31:09.303 --> 00:31:11.098
and that's what metonymy is.
 

00:31:11.098 --> 00:31:16.019
Metonymy is a selection of
signs, if you will,

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:19.648
that go appropriately next to
each other according to the

00:31:19.648 --> 00:31:23.730
rules of grammar and syntax and
according to the rules of logic,

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:27.555
right;
but also perhaps in the ways in

00:31:27.555 --> 00:31:33.598
which the rhetorical device of
metonymy can be understood.

00:31:33.598 --> 00:31:40.318
If I say "hut"
instead of "house"--

00:31:40.318 --> 00:31:43.237
I'm using an example actually
taken from Jakobson's

00:31:43.237 --> 00:31:44.930
"aphasia"
essay--

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:49.596
and if I say,
"The hut is small,"

00:31:49.596 --> 00:31:54.596
there is a metonymic
relationship implied with

00:31:54.596 --> 00:31:58.114
houses,
shacks, mansions,

00:31:58.114 --> 00:32:03.088
and other sorts of edifice,
but which can only really be

00:32:03.088 --> 00:32:05.826
resolved,
perhaps, by the unfolding of

00:32:05.826 --> 00:32:09.440
the logic of the sentence as in
when I say,

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.740
"The hut is small."
 

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:14.096
So combinatory
processes--borrowing the

00:32:14.096 --> 00:32:17.188
rhetorical term
"metonymy"

00:32:17.188 --> 00:32:21.869
as "that which is next to
each other"--

00:32:21.869 --> 00:32:23.808
are basically metonymic.
 

00:32:23.808 --> 00:32:28.862
The available signs to be
selected, on the other hand,

00:32:28.862 --> 00:32:34.582
on the axis of selection are
selected for certain purposes if

00:32:34.582 --> 00:32:36.868
they are metaphoric.
 

00:32:36.868 --> 00:32:40.386
Obviously, if I'm just making a
sentence, I'm not selecting

00:32:40.386 --> 00:32:42.509
signs because they're
metaphoric.

00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:46.064
I select them because they go
easily next to each other,

00:32:46.064 --> 00:32:49.358
either for reasons of grammar
or syntax or logic.

00:32:49.358 --> 00:32:53.434
Now let's look at Jakobson's
six functions [gestures towards

00:32:53.434 --> 00:32:55.368
board]
taken all together.

00:32:55.368 --> 00:32:58.874
I think this is by no means
difficult, and I think that

00:32:58.874 --> 00:33:02.701
Jakobson's analysis of the six
functions is just absolutely,

00:33:02.701 --> 00:33:04.130
totally brilliant.
 

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.708
In fact, I'm so profoundly
convinced by what Jakobson says

00:33:07.708 --> 00:33:11.537
about these six functions that I
really think there isn't much

00:33:11.537 --> 00:33:13.170
&gt;
 

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.500
else to say about an utterance.
 

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.028
Obviously in different
registers there's lots to say,

00:33:18.028 --> 00:33:22.723
but in the spirit of
Jakobsonian analysis there's no

00:33:22.723 --> 00:33:28.798
possible complaint you can make
about this except possibly one,

00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:31.980
which I probably won't get to
until next time.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.065
In the meantime,
it's just staggeringly

00:33:35.065 --> 00:33:36.038
effective.
 

00:33:36.038 --> 00:33:41.484
Let me use the example of an
expression which is surely as

00:33:41.484 --> 00:33:45.425
uninteresting--
I've groped as much as I could

00:33:45.425 --> 00:33:50.135
to find the most uninteresting
possible expression to show the

00:33:50.135 --> 00:33:54.306
way in which any utterance
whatsoever entails these six

00:33:54.306 --> 00:33:57.548
functions: "It is
raining."

00:33:57.548 --> 00:34:00.568
Oh, boy, "Excitement
rains," as they say.

00:34:00.568 --> 00:34:04.248
In any case,
let's say that I am an

00:34:04.248 --> 00:34:09.550
addresser--that is to say,
I'm a Romantic poet.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:13.860
I say--probably ill advisedly
if I'm a poet,

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:18.514
but I'm a Romantic poet--I say,
sort of waking everybody up

00:34:18.514 --> 00:34:20.829
when I say it,
"It is raining."

00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:21.730
All right.
 

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:23.280
What do I mean
&gt;

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.420
if I'm a Romantic poet?
 

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.836
What I mean to say is "I'm
singing in the rain"

00:34:28.836 --> 00:34:31.400
or "It's raining in my
heart."

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.237
In other words,
I'm expressing something

00:34:34.237 --> 00:34:37.514
emotional in saying "It is
raining,"

00:34:37.514 --> 00:34:41.590
so that sense of the expression
"It is raining"

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:45.230
is what Jakobson calls the
emotive function.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.809
Now I'm being addressed.
 

00:34:47.809 --> 00:34:51.429
The thrust of the message is
toward the addressee.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.963
It's being spoken by an
addresser, but it's aimed at an

00:34:54.963 --> 00:34:55.750
addressee.
 

00:34:55.750 --> 00:35:01.282
That addressee is a small child
going out the door without his

00:35:01.282 --> 00:35:04.989
coat on,
and his mother or father says,

00:35:04.989 --> 00:35:08.150
"It is raining,"
right,

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:12.130
which means--of course as a
conative function,

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.608
as a command,
as something which has a design

00:35:15.608 --> 00:35:18.996
on the addressee--
what it means is "Put your

00:35:18.996 --> 00:35:19.869
coat on."
 

00:35:19.869 --> 00:35:24.449
But you don't necessarily say,
"Put your coat on."

00:35:24.449 --> 00:35:26.657
You say, "It is
raining,"

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:28.929
and that's the conative
function.

00:35:28.929 --> 00:35:31.541
That's what Jakobson calls
"the set to the

00:35:31.541 --> 00:35:33.530
addressee":
that is to say,

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:37.510
the basic dominant bearing that
the message has,

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:41.230
the "set,"
is a set to the addressee.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:44.480
Now there's a context for any
utterance.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.807
This much I suppose none of us
would think to disagree with:

00:35:47.807 --> 00:35:49.894
I'm a weatherman,
I'm a meteorologist,

00:35:49.894 --> 00:35:50.460
right?
 

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.400
I don't even have to look out
the window.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.884
I look at my charts and I
announce confidently through the

00:35:55.884 --> 00:35:58.329
microphone, "It is
raining."

00:35:58.329 --> 00:35:59.250
Right?
 

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.630
Everybody takes me seriously.
 

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:04.849
The referential function of
"It is raining"

00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:07.079
is supposed to convey
information.

00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:08.864
I'm a weatherman,
and I'm supposed to know what

00:36:08.864 --> 00:36:09.639
I'm talking about.
 

00:36:09.639 --> 00:36:12.882
So if a weatherman tells me
"It is raining,"

00:36:12.882 --> 00:36:14.780
I believe that it is raining.
 

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.570
I put my hand out the door and,
sure enough,

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:20.599
it is raining,
and the referential function--

00:36:20.599 --> 00:36:24.228
the dominant in the expression
"It is raining"

00:36:24.228 --> 00:36:28.309
as referential function--
has been confirmed.

00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:31.710
I don't expect the weatherman
to be telling me somehow

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.853
secretly that he's crying when
he says "It is

00:36:34.853 --> 00:36:36.135
raining,"
right?

00:36:36.135 --> 00:36:37.675
&gt;
 

00:36:37.675 --> 00:36:38.510
Right?
 

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:42.014
I expect him to tell me the
truth about the weather,

00:36:42.014 --> 00:36:45.449
right, and that's what I'm
listening to him for.

00:36:45.449 --> 00:36:46.449
All right.
 

00:36:46.449 --> 00:36:48.369
Now "the set to the
contact."

00:36:48.369 --> 00:36:52.375
Jakobson gives you those
wonderful examples from Dorothy

00:36:52.375 --> 00:36:55.507
Parker's representation of a
date: "Oh,

00:36:55.507 --> 00:36:56.090
boy.
 

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:57.925
Well, here we are,
yeah, here we are,

00:36:57.925 --> 00:36:59.150
&gt;
 

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:02.420
yeah, we sure are here,"
and so on,

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.981
right--in other words,
in a state of abject and acute

00:37:05.981 --> 00:37:08.860
nervousness filling the air with
words,

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:13.329
right, so that you're on a
date, right,

00:37:13.329 --> 00:37:15.590
and you can't think of anything
to say.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.018
&gt;
 

00:37:17.018 --> 00:37:18.172
I really feel sorry for you.
 

00:37:18.172 --> 00:37:19.079
&gt;
 

00:37:19.079 --> 00:37:20.150
&gt;
 

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:23.755
You're on a date and you can't
think of anything to say so you

00:37:23.755 --> 00:37:25.585
say,
"It is raining,"

00:37:25.585 --> 00:37:27.710
and of course your interlocutor
says,

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:30.460
"Yeah, it's raining,"
and you say,

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.900
"It's raining hard,"
and she says,

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.269
"Well, yeah.
 

00:37:34.269 --> 00:37:35.679
Maybe it'll stop soon."
 

00:37:35.679 --> 00:37:39.478
So the conversation continues,
and that's phatic

00:37:39.478 --> 00:37:43.842
function--checking to make sure
the contact is working:

00:37:43.842 --> 00:37:46.590
"testing one,
two, three;

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:48.360
can you hear me?"
 

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:53.733
That's what the set to the
contact is: anything that

00:37:53.733 --> 00:37:59.844
confirms that you're actually
sort of in communication with

00:37:59.844 --> 00:38:03.373
somebody,
and anything we can say has

00:38:03.373 --> 00:38:04.590
that component.
 

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.657
I mean, if I'm a physicist and
I'm going out on a date with

00:38:07.657 --> 00:38:09.878
another physicist,
I say, "E equals MC

00:38:09.878 --> 00:38:10.829
squared."
 

00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:13.869
Only I'm not saying "E
equals MC squared";

00:38:13.869 --> 00:38:15.230
I'm filling the air with words.
 

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:19.407
So once again,
it's the set to the contact,

00:38:19.407 --> 00:38:25.079
and any message in the right
context has that function.

00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:29.867
The set to the code is when
we're not sure that we

00:38:29.867 --> 00:38:35.242
adequately share the code with
another person on a given

00:38:35.242 --> 00:38:40.811
occasion so that we back away
from simply saying things to

00:38:40.811 --> 00:38:45.599
make sure that what we're saying
is clear,

00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:47.190
in other words to define them.
 

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:49.400
I say, "There's a mare in
the field."

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.170
Somebody says,
"What is a mare?"

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.550
"Well, it's a female
horse."

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:56.166
"Well, it's a female
horse" is the metalingual

00:38:56.166 --> 00:38:56.889
function.
 

00:38:56.889 --> 00:38:59.268
But we're talking about
"It is raining."

00:38:59.268 --> 00:39:00.782
This is where it really gets
interesting.

00:39:00.782 --> 00:39:01.690
&gt;
 

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.831
The most interesting thing
about "It is raining"

00:39:04.831 --> 00:39:07.590
in terms of these six functions
is metalingual,

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.159
because what on earth is
"it"?

00:39:10.159 --> 00:39:11.260
Right?
 

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.110
Somebody tells me "It is
raining."

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:14.260
I say, "What?
 

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.530
What are you talking about?
 

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:16.590
What is 'it'?
 

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:19.179
I have absolutely no idea what
you're saying."

00:39:19.179 --> 00:39:21.851
I've noticed that other
languages have this same weird

00:39:21.851 --> 00:39:23.717
phenomenon"
"Il pleut,"

00:39:23.717 --> 00:39:25.030
"Es regnet."
 

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.869
What on earth does any of that
mean?

00:39:26.869 --> 00:39:28.099
What is "il"?
 

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:28.900
What is "es"?
 

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.739
What is "it"?
 

00:39:29.739 --> 00:39:31.110
Is it God?
 

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:31.860
Is it Jupiter Pluvius?
 

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.719
Is it the cloud canopy?
 

00:39:33.719 --> 00:39:36.922
Well, it sort of is the cloud
canopy, but that's sort of

00:39:36.922 --> 00:39:39.367
clearly not what's meant by
"it,"

00:39:39.367 --> 00:39:39.949
right?
 

00:39:39.949 --> 00:39:43.474
"It"
is a kind of grammatical and

00:39:43.474 --> 00:39:48.172
syntactical anomaly which is
extremely difficult even for

00:39:48.172 --> 00:39:51.530
linguists to analyze and to
explain;

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:56.782
so that when I try to say,
"It is raining,"

00:39:56.782 --> 00:39:59.489
I can expect,
if I am talking to a

00:39:59.489 --> 00:40:03.190
literalist, of course,
the metalingual function to

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.340
kick in and,
in fact, bite me in the shin.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:10.911
It's no picnic with the
metalingual function in mind

00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:14.139
saying, "It is
raining."

00:40:14.139 --> 00:40:16.195
What kind of a definition of
"it"

00:40:16.195 --> 00:40:17.565
is "It's raining?"
 

00:40:17.565 --> 00:40:18.789
&gt;
 

00:40:18.789 --> 00:40:23.900
So problems arise but they're
interesting problems,

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.768
and they are a function,
one of the six functions,

00:40:26.768 --> 00:40:28.889
of the expression "It is
raining."

00:40:28.889 --> 00:40:31.474
Poetic function is
unfortunately not very

00:40:31.474 --> 00:40:32.380
interesting.
 

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.340
That's the one drawback of this
example,

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.836
but there's still plenty to
say: "ih-ih"

00:40:37.836 --> 00:40:40.079
and the "ih"
in raining,

00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:41.934
which one can hear--the double
"ih"

00:40:41.934 --> 00:40:45.380
in raining,
the monosyllables suggesting a

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:50.672
kind of a quick declaration of
something followed by a sense of

00:40:50.672 --> 00:40:55.367
duration that one always feels
when one is aware of rain

00:40:55.367 --> 00:40:59.121
coming: that "It is
rainnnnnnning,"

00:40:59.121 --> 00:41:03.646
so that the duration of
prolongation of the word has a

00:41:03.646 --> 00:41:07.998
kind of semantic value
indicating to us that this is

00:41:07.998 --> 00:41:11.641
something ongoing--
in other words,

00:41:11.641 --> 00:41:15.972
a variety of ways in which the
poetic function of "It is

00:41:15.972 --> 00:41:18.500
raining"
can be considered.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.090
For the poetic function to be
dominant--

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:26.003
as I suggested when I said a
Romantic poet wouldn't be very

00:41:26.003 --> 00:41:30.579
smart if he or she said "It
was raining"--

00:41:30.579 --> 00:41:36.760
would really be taxing for
anyone who wanted to make it so.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:43.697
But any function could be the
dominant in a certain situation

00:41:43.697 --> 00:41:46.590
of any given utterance.
 

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:51.425
So that then,
sort of, perhaps serves to

00:41:51.425 --> 00:41:58.369
suffice as an analysis of
Jakobson's understanding of the

00:41:58.369 --> 00:42:02.090
structure of an utterance.
 

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:06.119
It has a structure
insofar--that is to say a

00:42:06.119 --> 00:42:11.367
metaphoric as opposed to a
metonymic structure insofar as

00:42:11.367 --> 00:42:17.085
we observe the presence of some
kind of pressure from the axis

00:42:17.085 --> 00:42:20.385
of selection,
the principle of equivalence

00:42:20.385 --> 00:42:24.135
and the axis of selection,
bringing itself to bear on the

00:42:24.135 --> 00:42:27.389
way in which the combination
takes place.

00:42:27.389 --> 00:42:31.860
It's just incredible that you
say, "It is raining."

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.739
What could be more prosaic than
"It is raining?"

00:42:33.739 --> 00:42:35.659
All of a sudden you notice that
string of "i's."

00:42:35.659 --> 00:42:37.659
You notice all kinds of other
things about it.

00:42:37.659 --> 00:42:44.246
The way in which the most banal
utterance is combined is likely

00:42:44.246 --> 00:42:48.920
in one form or another almost
unavoidable.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.257
I suppose I should use the
strong argument and say

00:42:52.257 --> 00:42:56.005
"unavoidably":
is likely unavoidably to entail

00:42:56.005 --> 00:42:58.389
aspects of the poetic function.
 

00:42:58.389 --> 00:43:03.454
Where the poetic function is
dominant you have literariness,

00:43:03.454 --> 00:43:07.746
and that of course,
is the old object of scientific

00:43:07.746 --> 00:43:11.179
attention of the Russian
formalists;

00:43:11.179 --> 00:43:14.500
but it is refined in a way
that, I think,

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:20.235
is structuralist by Jakobson
because he insists on the binary

00:43:20.235 --> 00:43:25.590
nature of the process of
combining elements from the axis

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:29.510
of selection if they are
equivalent--

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.253
binary being "same,"
"opposite,"

00:43:33.253 --> 00:43:36.411
"similar,"
"dissimilar,"

00:43:36.411 --> 00:43:40.670
and the variety of patterns in
which those relations,

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.760
"same,"
"opposite,"

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.344
"similar,"
and "dissimilar,"

00:43:45.344 --> 00:43:46.940
can be launched into use.
 

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:56.193
Now I've actually reached the
point at which possibly I could

00:43:56.193 --> 00:44:05.447
get involved in some elements of
critique, and I suppose I'll

00:44:05.447 --> 00:44:06.989
begin.
 

00:44:06.989 --> 00:44:11.143
I may not finish but we can
always carry over into the next

00:44:11.143 --> 00:44:11.860
lecture.
 

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.469
So since we've been talking
about Jakobson,

00:44:14.469 --> 00:44:19.295
let me call your attention to
one problem in what seems to me

00:44:19.295 --> 00:44:23.880
otherwise to be a truly
remarkable exercise of thought.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.170
That problem arises on page 858.
 

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:34.400
He himself recognizes that it's
a problem.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.036
He acknowledges it's a problem,
but he wants to say that he's

00:44:38.036 --> 00:44:40.159
solved it in saying what he
says.

00:44:40.159 --> 00:44:45.043
It's about two thirds of the
way down the page and it's about

00:44:45.043 --> 00:44:49.193
the relationship between the
poetic function and the

00:44:49.193 --> 00:44:53.811
metalingual function,
between the set to the message

00:44:53.811 --> 00:44:57.019
and the set to the code,
as he puts it.

00:44:57.019 --> 00:45:00.012
This is what he says:
It may be objected [Yes,

00:45:00.012 --> 00:45:02.704
and here we are objecting,
right?]

00:45:02.704 --> 00:45:07.382
that metalanguage also makes a
sequential use of equivalent

00:45:07.382 --> 00:45:12.222
units when combining synonymic
expressions into an equational

00:45:12.222 --> 00:45:16.496
sentence: A = A
("Mare is the female of

00:45:16.496 --> 00:45:19.320
the horse").
 

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:23.471
Poetry and metalanguage,
however, are in diametrical

00:45:23.471 --> 00:45:27.215
opposition to each other
[They're not the same,

00:45:27.215 --> 00:45:28.030
right?
 

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:31.385
They're in diametrical
opposition to each other]:

00:45:31.385 --> 00:45:35.581
in metalanguage the sequence is
used to build an equation [in

00:45:35.581 --> 00:45:39.960
other words,
to prove that one term can be

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.139
understood in terms of other
terms],

00:45:44.139 --> 00:45:51.119
whereas in poetry the equation
is used to build a sequence.

00:45:51.119 --> 00:45:51.679
Okay.
 

00:45:51.679 --> 00:45:53.920
Now in one sense this is true,
obviously.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.190
Yes, that is,
I know when I'm speaking

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.320
metalanguage and I know when I'm
speaking poetry.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.960
Maybe you know it too,
but what Jakobson has actually

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:08.780
done is he's sort of exposed a
structuralist nerve,

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:14.260
because he has appealed to
intention: that is to say,

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:18.952
he's said the metalingual
expression has one intention and

00:46:18.952 --> 00:46:22.739
the poetic expression has
another intention.

00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:23.530
What does that mean?
 

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:27.878
It has a genesis;
it has an origin in an

00:46:27.878 --> 00:46:33.936
intending consciousness just as
in traditions that are not

00:46:33.936 --> 00:46:39.210
structuralist,
things have origins in prior

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:45.690
causes and not in their
structural relationship between

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:47.369
two things.
 

00:46:47.369 --> 00:46:50.648
In other words,
if structuralism is a critique

00:46:50.648 --> 00:46:53.728
of genesis,
as is the case with Edmund

00:46:53.728 --> 00:46:57.530
Leach's analysis of the biblical
text Genesis,

00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:02.898
as is the case certainly with
Levi-Strauss' understanding of

00:47:02.898 --> 00:47:07.027
the Oedipus myth,
from two and not from one--if

00:47:07.027 --> 00:47:10.289
structuralism is a critique of
genesis,

00:47:10.289 --> 00:47:14.221
what happens when you have to
make a distinction between two

00:47:14.221 --> 00:47:17.460
entities in your system,
the poetic function and the

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.588
metalingual function,
in terms of their genesis:

00:47:20.588 --> 00:47:23.989
that is to say,
in terms of the intention that

00:47:23.989 --> 00:47:25.429
stands behind them?
 

00:47:25.429 --> 00:47:28.858
As I said, the example seems
trivial because we're all more

00:47:28.858 --> 00:47:31.931
than prepared to agree with
Jakobson that we know the

00:47:31.931 --> 00:47:35.240
difference when we see it
between the metalingual and the

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.097
poetic functions,
but he's not actually saying we

00:47:38.097 --> 00:47:39.768
know the difference when we see
it.

00:47:39.768 --> 00:47:42.070
Maybe it would have been better
if he had said,

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.869
"Well, anybody can see
what's metalingual and what's

00:47:44.869 --> 00:47:45.719
poetic."
 

00:47:45.719 --> 00:47:47.969
Maybe it would have been better
if he had.

00:47:47.969 --> 00:47:50.909
What he says instead is that
metalingual is intended to do

00:47:50.909 --> 00:47:53.333
one thing;
poetic is intended to do

00:47:53.333 --> 00:47:54.460
another thing.
 

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.954
That opens, actually,
a can of worms about all six

00:47:57.954 --> 00:47:58.809
functions.
 

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:02.012
I stand here in front of you
and I say "It is

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:03.059
raining."
 

00:48:03.059 --> 00:48:06.865
How do you know what I am
intending, right:

00:48:06.865 --> 00:48:11.579
whether I'm nervous and sort of
just being phatic;

00:48:11.579 --> 00:48:15.949
whether I am really unhappy or
happy;

00:48:15.949 --> 00:48:18.431
whether I think you're
crazy--it is in fact raining

00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:20.219
outside and I don't see any
coats;

00:48:20.219 --> 00:48:24.195
or whether I am actually sort
of just masquerading as an

00:48:24.195 --> 00:48:27.739
English professor--I am really a
meteorologist?

00:48:27.739 --> 00:48:31.690
You don't know any of these
things.

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:34.590
You have to infer an intention,
right?

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:38.610
If you infer an intention in
order to make these

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:43.010
distinctions,
how can the structuralist

00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:49.677
imperative of structure rather
than genesis be preserved

00:48:49.677 --> 00:48:50.889
intact?
 

00:48:50.889 --> 00:48:56.320
How can we insist that we know
things negatively and not

00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:01.159
positively if we have to infer a
direct cause,

00:49:01.159 --> 00:49:05.166
a positive cause,
in order to grasp distinctions

00:49:05.166 --> 00:49:07.980
even between the six functions?
 

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:12.190
That's a rhetorical question
with which I don't necessarily

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:16.327
agree but it is a potential
objection that you may wish to

00:49:16.327 --> 00:49:18.070
explore on your own.
 

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:21.083
Now the critique of
Levi-Strauss I have already

00:49:21.083 --> 00:49:24.360
hinted at, but there's another
aspect of it too.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:28.572
That I will defer until next
time because you'll find that

00:49:28.572 --> 00:49:32.858
the essay of Derrida's that
you're reading is largely about

00:49:32.858 --> 00:49:35.969
Levi-Strauss,
so it will make a natural segue

00:49:35.969 --> 00:49:39.588
between what we're talking about
today and what we'll be talking

00:49:39.588 --> 00:49:42.755
about Thursday,
to return first to certain

00:49:42.755 --> 00:49:47.224
aspects of Levi-Strauss'
argument and then get going with

00:49:47.224 --> 00:49:49.300
what Derrida is saying.
 

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.590
Thank you.
 

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:52.199
See you then.

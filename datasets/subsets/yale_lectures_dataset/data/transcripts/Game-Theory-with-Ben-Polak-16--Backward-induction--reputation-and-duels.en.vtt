00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.358
Professor Ben Polak: So
this is what we did last time:

00:00:05.358 --> 00:00:09.240
we looked at a game involving
an entrant and an incumbent in a

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.978
market;
and the entrant had to decide

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:14.580
whether to enter that market or
not;

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.730
and if they stayed out the
incumbent remained a monopolist;

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.850
and the monopolist made 3
million in profit.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.952
If the entrant goes in,
then the incumbent can decide

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:27.114
whether to accommodate the
entrant and just settle for

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:29.680
duopoly profits,
making a million each;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.354
or the incumbent can fight,
in which case the incumbent

00:00:33.354 --> 00:00:37.710
makes no money at all and the
entrant loses a million dollars.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.060
We pointed out a number of
things about this game.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.483
One was that when we analyzed
it in a matrix form we quickly

00:00:44.483 --> 00:00:48.306
found that there were two Nash
Equilibria, that Nash

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:51.230
Equilibrium were:
in and not fight;

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.468
and out and fight.
But we argued that backward

00:00:55.468 --> 00:00:59.053
induction tells us that the
sensible answer is in and not

00:00:59.053 --> 00:01:01.409
fight.
Once the incumbent knows the

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.160
entrant is in they're not going
to fight because 1 is bigger

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.719
than 0, and the entrant
anticipating this will enter.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.482
When we talked a little bit
more we said this other

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:14.135
equilibrium, this out fight
equilibrium--it is an

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:17.339
equilibrium because if the
entrant believes the incumbent's

00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:20.599
going to fight then the entrant
is going to stay out,

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:24.395
and it's costless for the
incumbent to "fight" if in fact

00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:28.055
the entrant does stay out
because they never get called

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.593
upon to fight anyway.
So the idea of this was that

00:01:31.593 --> 00:01:35.805
for the incumbent to say they're
going to fight is an "incredible

00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:38.030
threat."
That's terrible English.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.580
It's the way it is always
taught in the textbooks.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.010
It needs to be called a "not
credible" threat.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.072
And that "not credible" threat
is: he's not really going to

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:47.240
fight if the entrant comes in,
and therefore,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.364
the entrant should come in and
in fact the incumbent will

00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:54.060
accommodate it.
So what we've shown here is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.851
that, if we believe this
argument, then the entrant will

00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:59.489
come in and the incumbent is
going to let him in.

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.685
At the end, we started talking
about this in a slightly more

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:05.123
elaborate setting,
so let's just remind you of

00:02:05.123 --> 00:02:07.290
what that more elaborate setting
is.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.300
The more elaborate setting is
suppose that there is one firm,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.806
one monopolist,
and that monopolist holds a

00:02:15.806 --> 00:02:18.979
monopoly in ten different
markets.

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.800
So we'll have our monopolist be
Ale.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.561
So here's Ale.
He's our monopolist,

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:28.830
and he owns pizzeria monopolies
in ten different markets.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.594
And each of these ten different
markets are separate,

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:34.356
they are different towns.
And in each of those ten

00:02:34.356 --> 00:02:37.672
markets he thinks--he knows he's
going to face an entrant and

00:02:37.672 --> 00:02:40.160
those entrants are going to come
in order.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.870
So let's just talk about who
those entrants are going to be.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.718
The entrants are going to be
this person, this person and so

00:02:44.718 --> 00:02:45.912
on.
Let's find out who they are,

00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:47.000
so your name is?
Student: Isabella 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.819
Professor Ben Polak: Where
are you from?

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.289
Student: Miami.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:50.490
Miami, so Miami is one of the
markets.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.580
Your name is?
Student: Scott.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.525
Professor Ben Polak:
From where?

00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:54.867
Student: Wisconsin.
 Professor Ben Polak:

00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:56.151
Where in Wisconsin?
Student: Madison.

00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:57.870
Professor Ben Polak:
Madison: we've got two towns.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.889
We're just going to do towns
now.

00:02:58.889 --> 00:02:59.801
Student: My name is
Lang.

00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:00.830
I'm from Bridgeport,
Connecticut.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.319
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, we've got three towns.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.253
Student: I'm from Miami
too.

00:03:03.253 --> 00:03:04.789
Professor Ben Polak:
Talk about Yale diversity.

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:06.229
Well we'll pretend you're from
somewhere else.

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.120
Put him in New Orleans or
something.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.887
Student: Chris from
Boston.

00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:10.120
Professor Ben Polak:
From Boston, all right.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.351
Student: From Orange,
Connecticut.

00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:13.167
Professor Ben Polak:
From Orange, Connecticut so just

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:14.182
down the road.
Student: St.

00:03:14.182 --> 00:03:15.527
Louis, Missouri.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:16.740
right, have we got ten yet?
I'm not quite at ten.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.604
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:03:19.604 --> 00:03:20.757
seven.
Student: Saffron,

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:21.486
New York.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:03:21.486 --> 00:03:22.300
right.
Student: Hong Kong.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.699
Professor Ben Polak:
Hong Kong, that's way away.

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:24.943
Student: Long Island.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:03:24.943 --> 00:03:26.561
Long Island.
I think I've probably got ten

00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:29.060
markets here.
So Ale owns a pizza shop.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.156
He's the monopoly pizza shop
owner in each of these ten

00:03:32.156 --> 00:03:34.089
markets.
And what we're going to see is

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:36.265
we're going to see what happens
as, sequentially,

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:38.957
these entrants try to enter.
The way that this game's going

00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:41.490
to work is that they're lined
up--we know the order in which

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.771
the entrants are going to come.
They're going to start off,

00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:45.565
the first person who is going
to have to make a decision is-

00:03:45.565 --> 00:03:46.629
Student: Enter.
Isabella.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.660
Professor Ben Polak: Is
Isabella, right?

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.350
We're going to see how our
monopolist responds.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.253
So let's have a look at this.
So Isabella who is in which

00:03:56.253 --> 00:03:57.050
market again?
Student: Miami.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.223
Professor Ben Polak: In
Miami, okay what are you going

00:03:58.223 --> 00:03:59.074
to do?
Student: Enter.

00:03:59.074 --> 00:04:00.780
Professor Ben Polak:
What are you going to do?

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.212
Student: I will fight.
Professor Ben Polak: Oh

00:04:03.212 --> 00:04:04.879
dear, so you owe me a million
dollars.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.548
So one person's down a million
dollars, let's see what happens

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:10.184
next.
Student: I'm going to

00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:11.745
stay out.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:04:11.745 --> 00:04:14.050
Which market was this?
Student: Scott. Madison.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.430
Professor Ben Polak:
Madison stayed out.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.282
Student: I'm going to
stay out.

00:04:16.282 --> 00:04:17.250
Professor Ben Polak:
Staying out.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.393
So Bridgeport stayed out.
Student: I guess I'll

00:04:19.393 --> 00:04:20.329
stay out.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.420
Stayed out again.
Student: Stay out.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.426
Professor Ben Polak:
Which market are we up to now,

00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:24.800
somewhere in Orange County
wasn't it?

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.938
Where were we?
Student Orange,

00:04:26.938 --> 00:04:28.379
Connecticut.
Stay out.

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.079
Professor Ben Polak:
Stay out.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:31.870
Student: I think I'll
stay in.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.032
Professor Ben Polak:
You'll come in okay,

00:04:33.032 --> 00:04:34.225
and which market is this?
Student: St.

00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:35.524
Louis, Missouri.
Professor Ben Polak: St.

00:04:35.524 --> 00:04:38.051
Louis, Missouri.
So you owe me a million dollars

00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:40.056
as well, okay.
A couple of million dollars is

00:04:40.056 --> 00:04:41.378
a good class.
We're going to have plenty of

00:04:41.378 --> 00:04:42.882
money for lunch.
Student: I'm also going

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:43.970
to fight.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.220
You're going to fight,
which market is that?

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.060
Student: Saffron,
New York.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.850
Professor Ben Polak:
Where abouts?

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.445
Student: Saffron.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:04:48.445 --> 00:04:49.490
Saffron, New York.
Where are we at?

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.597
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:04:52.597 --> 00:04:54.540
seven, eight,
Ale?

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.305
TA: Fight.
Professor Ben Polak: You

00:04:56.305 --> 00:04:57.267
fight?
So you owe me a million dollars

00:04:57.267 --> 00:04:59.360
too.
That was eight, nine?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.162
Student: Out.
Professor Ben Polak: Out

00:05:01.162 --> 00:05:02.240
and ten?
Student: Stay out.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.019
Professor Ben Polak:
Stays out, okay.

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:06.681
Now let's just notice something
here, which was the tenth

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.110
market?
What town were you?

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.396
Student: Long Island.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:11.579
Whereabouts in Long Island?
Student: Huntington.

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:13.382
Professor Ben Polak: So
if Huntington,

00:05:13.382 --> 00:05:15.922
Long Island our last market had
come in, suppose you'd said in,

00:05:15.922 --> 00:05:18.436
what would Ale have said?
TA: I would not have

00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:19.664
fought.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:05:19.664 --> 00:05:20.530
Would not have fought,
aha!

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.027
Okay, so what happened here?
When we analyzed this last time

00:05:25.027 --> 00:05:28.692
as an individual market,
we argued that each entrant

00:05:28.692 --> 00:05:32.430
should come in just as our first
entrant came in,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.040
and our monopolist should not
fight:.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.160
That's what we have up on the
board.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.650
That's what backward induction
suggests.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.978
But in fact, Ale fought.
A whole bunch of people came

00:05:42.978 --> 00:05:46.720
in, and a whole bunch of them
stayed out, is that right?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.461
Now why?
Why was Ale fighting these guys

00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:50.904
and why were they staying out?
Let's talk about why,

00:05:50.904 --> 00:05:53.375
and what market were you again?
Student: Madison,

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:54.637
Wisconsin.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:05:54.637 --> 00:05:55.670
why did Madison,
Wisconsin stay out?

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.310
Student: Well we talked
about it last time how he has an

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.695
incentive to fight now because
there's more that just our

00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:03.293
analysis up there in terms of
establishing that he'll fight to

00:06:03.293 --> 00:06:05.276
keep people out.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:06:05.276 --> 00:06:07.064
right, so it looks like there
might be some reason for

00:06:07.064 --> 00:06:09.122
fighting to keep you out.
So let's just talk about it a

00:06:09.122 --> 00:06:10.810
little bit more,
let's go to the third guy.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.491
Which market are you again?
Student: Bridgeport.

00:06:12.491 --> 00:06:14.319
Professor Ben Polak:
Bridgeport, so why did you stay

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.621
out?
Student: Because I knew

00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:16.854
he was going to fight.
Professor Ben Polak: You

00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:18.500
knew he was going to fight.
Now how did you know he was

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.601
going to fight?
Student: Because he has

00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:25.661
an incentive to establish,
he established that he was

00:06:25.661 --> 00:06:30.267
going to fight for every single
market and so I was going to

00:06:30.267 --> 00:06:33.225
lose out.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:36.894
right, so we know--we think we
know that Ale is--you know he's

00:06:36.894 --> 00:06:40.444
this tough Italian pizzeria
owner and we think he's going to

00:06:40.444 --> 00:06:43.572
try and establish what:
a reputation as being a tough

00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:46.279
pizzeria owner by fighting these
guys,

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:49.314
perhaps fighting a few guys
early on in order to keep these

00:06:49.314 --> 00:06:51.948
guys out.
In fact, he had to fight the

00:06:51.948 --> 00:06:56.359
first person but he kept out
2,3, 4,5, 6 and this person came

00:06:56.359 --> 00:07:00.550
in, so 7 and 8 came in,
but then 9 and 10 he kept out.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.812
So he kept a lot of people out
of the market by fighting early

00:07:03.812 --> 00:07:06.181
on.
Now this argument sounds right:

00:07:06.181 --> 00:07:08.954
it seems to ring true.
It's about establishing

00:07:08.954 --> 00:07:12.018
reputation, but now I want to
show you that there's a worry

00:07:12.018 --> 00:07:14.703
with this argument.
The worry is this is a

00:07:14.703 --> 00:07:18.513
sequential game and like all
sequential games of perfect

00:07:18.513 --> 00:07:22.530
information we've seen in the
class, we should analyze this

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.256
game how?
Now that wasn't loud enough,

00:07:25.256 --> 00:07:27.319
how?
Backward induction.

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:30.259
So where's the back?
Where's the back of this game?

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:34.180
Way back here--sorry for the
guys in the balcony.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.083
Way back here we have the last
market in town--which was the

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:41.016
last market?
And if we look at this last

00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:45.030
market, we in fact saw that if
the last market came in,

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.199
Ale in fact gave in.
Ale gave in.

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:50.430
Now why did Ale give in,
in the last market?

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.160
Let's have a look back on the
board.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.930
So on the board we can see what
that last market looks like.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.220
With ten markets this is a very
complicated game.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.017
This would be the first market,
and then there's three versions

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:06.633
of the second market depending
on what Ale did in the first

00:08:06.633 --> 00:08:08.134
market,
and so there's nine versions of

00:08:08.134 --> 00:08:10.065
the third one.
The tree for this game is

00:08:10.065 --> 00:08:11.522
horrendous.
But nevertheless,

00:08:11.522 --> 00:08:14.122
once we get to the end of the
game, the tenth market--which

00:08:14.122 --> 00:08:15.710
was what?
Bridgeport or something,

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.029
I've forgotten where it was at
now--wherever it was.

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:22.034
Once we get to that last market
this tree pretty well describes

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:24.360
that last market--is that
correct?

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.700
There isn't another market
afterwards.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.536
There's only ten markets.
So, in this last market,

00:08:30.536 --> 00:08:33.169
what do we know Ale's going to
do?

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.378
In this last market if the
entrant enters Ale is going to

00:08:36.378 --> 00:08:39.300
not fight, which is what exactly
what Ale did do.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.020
So Ale is that right?
So when in fact we discussed

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.429
the tenth guy coming in,
you chose to?

00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:47.340
TA: I would have chosen
not to fight.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.440
Professor Ben Polak:
Would have chosen not to fight.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.799
That's exactly what the model
predicts.

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:53.643
He has no incentive to
establish a reputation for the

00:08:53.643 --> 00:08:56.760
eleventh market because there
isn't an eleventh market.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.059
He's done at ten.
Is that right?

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:03.278
So we know that in the last
market, the tenth market,

00:09:03.278 --> 00:09:06.279
Ale actually is not going to
fight.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:10.728
Therefore, the person who's the
entrant in the tenth market

00:09:10.728 --> 00:09:15.790
should know that they can safely
enter and Ale won't fight them.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.269
But now we're in trouble.
Why are we in trouble?

00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:21.335
Well let's go back to the ninth
market, the second to last

00:09:21.335 --> 00:09:22.600
market.
So I've forgotten where it was.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.179
Raise your hand,
the second to the last market.

00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:26.920
Okay, the second to last market
is this guy?

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.643
You're the tenth market?
So this guy who is in the Hong

00:09:30.643 --> 00:09:34.809
Kong market, he should know he's
the second to last market.

00:09:34.809 --> 00:09:39.316
He knows that no matter what he
does the tenth market's going to

00:09:39.316 --> 00:09:43.250
enter and Ale's going to give in
to the tenth market.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.490
Ale's going to let the tenth
entrant in.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.874
Is that right?
So the ninth market actually

00:09:47.874 --> 00:09:51.472
knows that nothing Ale's going
to do here is going to establish

00:09:51.472 --> 00:09:53.909
a reputation to keep the tenth
guy out.

00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:55.890
So therefore in fact,
he should what?

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.908
He should come in, right?
He should come in,

00:09:57.908 --> 00:10:00.098
and in fact if he had come in,
Ale would have had to give in

00:10:00.098 --> 00:10:02.399
because there's no way that Ale
can keep the tenth guy out.

00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:07.049
We just argued the tenth guy's
coming in by backward induction.

00:10:07.049 --> 00:10:08.664
So since we know that the tenth
guy's coming in anyway,

00:10:08.664 --> 00:10:10.039
and in fact,
Ale's going to concede to them,

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:13.620
there's no point Ale trying to
scare off the tenth guy.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:20.340
So in fact, Ale's going to say
no fight to the ninth guy.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.264
But now we go to the eighth guy.
We've just argued that the

00:10:23.264 --> 00:10:26.080
tenth guy's coming in anyway and
Ale's going to give in to him.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.844
We've argued the ninth guy's
coming in, so Ale's going to

00:10:27.844 --> 00:10:29.608
give in to this guy as well
because you can't put off the

00:10:29.608 --> 00:10:31.579
tenth guy.
And therefore we know that once

00:10:31.579 --> 00:10:34.294
we get to the eighth guy,
once again, he can safely come

00:10:34.294 --> 00:10:37.205
in because Ale knows by backward
induction he can't keep the

00:10:37.205 --> 00:10:39.179
ninth and the tenth guy out
anyway,

00:10:39.179 --> 00:10:41.513
and so this guy should come in
as well, and if we do this

00:10:41.513 --> 00:10:47.850
argument all the way back,
what do we get?

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.750
He lets everybody in.
Everybody should come in and he

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.230
should let everybody in.
So we have a problem here.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.965
We have a problem.
Backward induction says,

00:10:56.965 --> 00:11:00.559
even with these ten markets,
Ale in fact should let

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:03.488
everybody in.
Everyone should know that,

00:11:03.488 --> 00:11:06.769
so they should come in.
So there's a disconnect here.

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:09.579
There's a disconnect between
what the theory is telling

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:12.545
us--backward induction is
telling us Ale can't keep people

00:11:12.545 --> 00:11:15.531
out by threatening to fight,
by establishing a reputation

00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:17.889
--, and what we actually just
saw, what happened,

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:20.951
which was Ale did fight and did
keep people out,

00:11:20.951 --> 00:11:24.470
and we know that other
monopolist's do that as well.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:29.919
So how can we make rigorous
this idea of reputation?

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:32.480
It's not captured by what we've
done so far in the class.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.788
So how can we bring back what
must be true in some sense--it's

00:11:35.788 --> 00:11:37.502
intuition that,
by fighting,

00:11:37.502 --> 00:11:41.600
Ale could keep people out and
therefore will keep people out.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.009
So to make that idea work I
want to introduce a new idea.

00:11:47.009 --> 00:11:51.124
And the new idea is that,
with very small probability,

00:11:51.124 --> 00:11:53.919
let's say 1% chance,
Ale is crazy.

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:57.139
So stand up a second,
so he looks like a normal kind

00:11:57.139 --> 00:12:00.990
of guy but there's just 1%
chance that he's really bonkers.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.970
There's a 1% chance that he's
actually Rahul.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:10.455
So now let's redo the
analysis--And what do I mean by

00:12:10.455 --> 00:12:12.813
bonkers?
By bonkers, I mean,

00:12:12.813 --> 00:12:16.379
with 1%, Ale is the kind of guy
who likes to fight.

00:12:16.379 --> 00:12:19.348
So with 1% chance,
he's actually not got these

00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:21.872
payoffs at all;
he's actually got some

00:12:21.872 --> 00:12:24.868
different payoffs,
which are payoffs of somebody

00:12:24.868 --> 00:12:28.628
who--okay he'll lose money--but
he so much enjoys a fight he

00:12:28.628 --> 00:12:31.590
gets +10 here.
That's the bonkers guy's payoff.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:35.080
But there's only 1% chance he's
this bonkers guy.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.200
So now what happens?
Let's just walk it through.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.073
With 1% chance,
if there was only one market,

00:12:42.073 --> 00:12:45.533
not the ten markets.
So there's only one market and

00:12:45.533 --> 00:12:47.919
this one market was--I've
forgotten your name?

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:48.599
Student: Isabella.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:49.240
Isabella, who was in which
market, I've forgotten.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.276
Student: Miami.
Professor Ben Polak: In

00:12:51.276 --> 00:12:54.613
Miami, then she doesn't really
much care about the 1% chance

00:12:54.613 --> 00:12:57.509
that Ale is actually Rahul.
That doesn't really bother her

00:12:57.509 --> 00:13:00.057
very much, why?
Because with 99% chance Ale's

00:13:00.057 --> 00:13:03.149
going to give way and that's
good enough odds.

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:06.120
With 99% chance she's happy to
come in.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.000
So if there was only one market
here, we'd be done.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.020
But with ten markets things are
a little different.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.003
Why? Let's see why.
So suppose in fact that

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:19.551
Isabella in Miami thinks that
Ale--and everybody else thinks

00:13:19.551 --> 00:13:23.620
Ale is a pretty sane guy.
With 99% probability he's a

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.440
sane guy, and Isabella enters
and everyone sees this.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.383
And to everyone's surprise,
rather than doing the sane

00:13:31.383 --> 00:13:36.145
thing, which is letting Isabella
in and switching to a duopoly in

00:13:36.145 --> 00:13:38.481
Miami,
what happens,

00:13:38.481 --> 00:13:44.970
in fact, after Isabella comes
in is that Ale fights.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.145
Okay, so now it's too late for
Isabella, she's lost her money,

00:13:48.145 --> 00:13:50.800
but our second market is,
what's your name again?

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.993
Student: Scott.
 Professor Ben Polak:

00:13:51.993 --> 00:13:53.460
Scott, which market were you?
Student: Madison.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.133
Professor Ben Polak: So
Scott in Madison has observed

00:13:56.133 --> 00:13:58.626
what happened in Miami and
initially he thought that Ale

00:13:58.626 --> 00:14:01.329
was Ale.
99% probability Ale was this

00:14:01.329 --> 00:14:03.720
sane, nice, calm,
Italian guy.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.148
But on the other hand,
he just saw this sane,

00:14:07.148 --> 00:14:11.121
calm, Italian guy fight,
as he shouldn't have fought

00:14:11.121 --> 00:14:15.095
because of backward
induction--fought the entrant in

00:14:15.095 --> 00:14:18.376
Miami.
So now Scott thinks to himself:

00:14:18.376 --> 00:14:22.009
hmm, I'm not so sure that Ale
is this sane guy.

00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:24.765
Maybe I should update my
beliefs in the direction of

00:14:24.765 --> 00:14:27.629
thinking that Ale might actually
be the insane guy.

00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:31.864
So maybe--we're up to maybe a
probability 1/3 that Ale's

00:14:31.864 --> 00:14:33.983
actually insane.
So he thinks:

00:14:33.983 --> 00:14:36.690
okay, probability 1/3 that's
still not very much,

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.438
I'll still risk it,
he comes in,

00:14:38.438 --> 00:14:42.420
and Ale fights him again.
It's a probability 1/3 he's

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.909
sane.
He's going to give in to me.

00:14:43.909 --> 00:14:45.980
He comes in--Ale fights him
again.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.970
So now we're in the third
market, which was which market?

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:49.630
Student: Bridgeport.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.659
Bridgeport.
And Bridgeport's seen this

00:14:51.659 --> 00:14:56.263
horrible fight going on in Miami
and this horrible fight going on

00:14:56.263 --> 00:14:58.777
in Madison,
and now he's getting pretty

00:14:58.777 --> 00:15:01.680
sure that this nice,
calm, looking Ale is not nice,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.159
calm, looking Ale.
He's crazy Rahul.

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:06.730
There's lot of evidence that
he's crazy Rahul.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.820
He's fought the last two
markets making huge losses.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.100
It must be that Ale likes to
fight.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.355
So what does he do?
He says, I'm going to stay out

00:15:13.355 --> 00:15:16.059
of here.
I'm convinced that this guy may

00:15:16.059 --> 00:15:19.556
be crazy, so I'll stay out.
And all the subsequent markets,

00:15:19.556 --> 00:15:22.750
they think: oh well you know he
fought these first two markets,

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.066
that means he must be a crazy
guy or at least there's a high

00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:26.480
probability that he's a crazy
guy,

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.114
so they all stay out which is
exactly what happened until we

00:15:29.114 --> 00:15:31.734
got to here.
And even here when they came in

00:15:31.734 --> 00:15:35.668
Ale acted liked crazy Rahul.
So what made that argument

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:38.971
possible was what?
What made that argument

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:43.098
possible was the small
possibility, the 1% possibility

00:15:43.098 --> 00:15:45.413
that Ale is bonkers.
But you know,

00:15:45.413 --> 00:15:47.740
how well do you know Ale?
There's a 1% chance he's

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.017
bonkers.
How many of you think you're

00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:52.200
really sure that he's a sane
guy?

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.850
He supports Italian football
teams, he's got to be pretty

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:58.549
crazy, right?
So what happened here?

00:15:58.549 --> 00:16:04.455
This small possibility that Ale
is crazy allowed him to build up

00:16:04.455 --> 00:16:08.580
a reputation that kept all these
guys out,

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.159
but actually the argument is
stronger than that.

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:13.049
Let's try and push this
argument harder.

00:16:13.049 --> 00:16:17.259
Suppose, in fact,
that Ale is not crazy.

00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:20.015
Suppose that Ale is the sane
Ale, the nice,

00:16:20.015 --> 00:16:24.509
calm, Ale we all know and love.
But we've just argued that if

00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:29.007
Ale acts as if he's the crazy
guy then you're going to be

00:16:29.007 --> 00:16:32.059
convinced that he is the crazy
guy,

00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:36.469
so by acting crazy he might be
able to convince you that he is

00:16:36.469 --> 00:16:39.000
crazy and therefore keep you
out.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.402
So we argued before that,
if there's some chance that

00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:45.019
Ale's crazy, by acting crazy
early on,

00:16:45.019 --> 00:16:47.532
he's going to deter these late
entrants from entering the

00:16:47.532 --> 00:16:50.044
market because they think
they're fighting Rahul and they

00:16:50.044 --> 00:16:53.540
don't want to fight Rahul.
But we said these early guys,

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.730
they had probability .99 that
he was sane;

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.479
and .6 that he was sane;
and maybe even .5 he was sane

00:16:59.479 --> 00:17:01.440
here--so they thought of coming
in.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.089
But now we're arguing that even
if Ale is sane,

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:08.660
even if he's that sane guy,
a rational guy,

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:14.353
he should behave as if he's
crazy in order to keep these

00:17:14.353 --> 00:17:17.727
late guys out.
And these early players knowing

00:17:17.727 --> 00:17:20.830
that even the sane version of
Ale is going to fight them,

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.165
should also stay out.
Now notice something's happened

00:17:23.165 --> 00:17:24.829
here.
They're not staying out because

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.200
they think Ale's crazy,
they're staying out because

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.045
they know that even the sane
version of Ale is going to fight

00:17:30.045 --> 00:17:32.730
them in order to seem crazy,
is that right?

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.029
Everyone see that's a stronger
argument?

00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:37.071
So now even these early guys
are going to stay out of the

00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:40.279
market.
Now we're almost there.

00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:43.655
What we've argued--let's just
make sure we get the two pieces

00:17:43.655 --> 00:17:48.661
of this on the board.
We've argued that if there's an

00:17:48.661 --> 00:17:52.852
epsilon chance,
a very small chance,

00:17:52.852 --> 00:17:58.599
let's call it a 1% chance where
Ale is crazy,

00:17:58.599 --> 00:18:11.597
then he can deter entry by
fighting, i.e.,

00:18:11.597 --> 00:18:18.329
seeming crazy.
We argued that what really

00:18:18.329 --> 00:18:22.031
makes this argument strong is
once we realize that the sane

00:18:22.031 --> 00:18:24.852
person's going to act crazy,
we really know that everyone's

00:18:24.852 --> 00:18:26.339
going to act crazy and therefore
we should stay out.

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:28.789
Now that argument won't quite
be right.

00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:31.127
So that's enough of the
argument I want you to have for

00:18:31.127 --> 00:18:33.465
the purpose of the exam,
but let me just point out that

00:18:33.465 --> 00:18:35.109
that argument isn't quite
correct.

00:18:35.109 --> 00:18:36.890
That can't quite be an
equilibrium.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.150
Now why can't that be an
equilibrium?

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.309
We've just argued that even the
sane version of Ale--so this is

00:18:42.309 --> 00:18:45.469
a sort of slightly more subtle
argument so just pay attention a

00:18:45.469 --> 00:18:47.797
second.
We've argued that even the sane

00:18:47.797 --> 00:18:50.589
version of Ale is going to act
like a crazy guy.

00:18:50.589 --> 00:18:57.589
So if anyone came in,
he's going to act crazy anyway.

00:18:57.589 --> 00:18:59.789
So you're not going to update
your belief as to whether he's

00:18:59.789 --> 00:19:01.988
crazy or sane because we know
that the crazy guy is going to

00:19:01.988 --> 00:19:04.187
fight because he likes fighting
and the sane guy is going to

00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:06.200
fight because he wants to seem
like a crazy guy.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.145
So you're really learning
nothing whether your observe him

00:19:08.145 --> 00:19:10.720
fighting or now.
But now let's go back to our

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.799
tenth market,
way back in our tenth market.

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:18.302
Our tenth market participant,
whose name was Andy,

00:19:18.302 --> 00:19:21.609
hasn't learned anything about
Ale.

00:19:21.609 --> 00:19:25.258
He hasn't learned anything
because whether Ale was sane or

00:19:25.258 --> 00:19:28.405
crazy he's going to fight.
So observing what his actions

00:19:28.405 --> 00:19:31.069
early on, if that was really an
equilibrium, our tenth guy

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:33.079
wouldn't have updated his belief
at all,

00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:35.178
and therefore,
would still believe with

00:19:35.178 --> 00:19:38.325
probability .99 that Ale was
sane, in which case our tenth

00:19:38.325 --> 00:19:41.347
guy would enter.
Once again, that argument would

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:44.704
unravel from the back.
So what I described before

00:19:44.704 --> 00:19:48.296
can't quite be an equilibrium.
It can't be just as simple as

00:19:48.296 --> 00:19:51.001
all sane guys are going to act
crazy because then you wouldn't

00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:52.713
learn anything.
So it turns out that the

00:19:52.713 --> 00:19:54.579
equilibrium in this model is
actually very subtle,

00:19:54.579 --> 00:19:55.950
and it involves mixed
strategies,

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.588
and mixed strategies are
something we did in the first

00:19:57.588 --> 00:19:59.634
half of the semester,
so we don't want to go back to

00:19:59.634 --> 00:20:00.858
it now.
So trust me,

00:20:00.858 --> 00:20:04.983
you can solve this out with
mixed strategies and the basic

00:20:04.983 --> 00:20:08.679
idea I gave you is right.
The basic idea is sane guys are

00:20:08.679 --> 00:20:12.018
occasionally going to act like
crazy guys in order to establish

00:20:12.018 --> 00:20:15.886
a reputation,
and that reputation helps them

00:20:15.886 --> 00:20:19.369
down the tree.
So this idea that even when

00:20:19.369 --> 00:20:23.034
there's a chain store,
people will enter--even when

00:20:23.034 --> 00:20:26.773
Ale has ten monopolies,
people will enter--this is a

00:20:26.773 --> 00:20:29.859
famous idea.
It's called the Chain Store

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:33.945
Paradox, and it's due to a guy
called Selten who actually won

00:20:33.945 --> 00:20:37.224
the Nobel Prize.
This is the Chain Store Paradox

00:20:37.224 --> 00:20:40.809
and this idea of establishing
reputation is a big idea.

00:20:40.809 --> 00:20:45.995
The idea is once again you
might want to behave as if

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:51.680
you're someone else in order to
deter people's actions,

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.849
in order to affect people's
actions down the tree.

00:20:54.849 --> 00:20:59.080
Okay, so what have we learned
here?

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:05.335
Let's just work it out.
So the first thing we learned

00:21:05.335 --> 00:21:08.660
was kind of a nerdy point,
but let me make it anyway.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.461
Introducing just a very,
very small probability,

00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:17.071
just a tiny probability that
Ale might be someone else--he

00:21:17.071 --> 00:21:19.918
might be a Rahul,
he might be crazy,

00:21:19.918 --> 00:21:23.556
he must like fights--that very
small probability radically

00:21:23.556 --> 00:21:27.865
changes the outcome of the game.
If we were all 100% sure he was

00:21:27.865 --> 00:21:31.480
sane we'd be tied by backward
induction and entry would

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.742
follow.
He wouldn't be able to keep

00:21:33.742 --> 00:21:36.171
anybody out.
But that small probability

00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:38.920
allows us to get a very
different outcome.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.009
That's the first point I want
to draw into this.

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:45.795
The second point I want to get
out of this, is really this idea

00:21:45.795 --> 00:21:48.730
of reputation.
There are lots of settings in

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.426
society where reputation matters
and one of them is a reputation

00:21:52.426 --> 00:21:55.597
to fight.
How many of you have friends

00:21:55.597 --> 00:21:59.768
who have somewhat short fuses?
You know people who have short

00:21:59.768 --> 00:22:01.810
fuses, right?
When you're going out,

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:05.424
choosing some movie to go to
with these guys who have short

00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:09.163
fuses or trying to decide who's
going to order something at a

00:22:09.163 --> 00:22:11.396
restaurant,
or who's going to get to be

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:14.099
which side when you're playing
some game, some video game.

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:17.076
I claim, is this true,
that the people who have

00:22:17.076 --> 00:22:20.311
slightly short fuses,
slightly more often get their

00:22:20.311 --> 00:22:23.394
way, is that right?
If you have a sibling who has a

00:22:23.394 --> 00:22:26.480
short fuse, they slightly more
often get their way and that's

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.519
exactly this idea.
They have short fuses,

00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:31.136
the fact that they tend to blow
up and get angry at you gives

00:22:31.136 --> 00:22:32.750
them a little bit of an
advantage.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:35.124
And notice that maybe they
don't have a short fuse at all,

00:22:35.124 --> 00:22:37.498
maybe they're just pretending
to have a short fuse because

00:22:37.498 --> 00:22:40.040
they know they're going to get
their way over you softies more

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.063
often.
None of you have short fuses,

00:22:42.063 --> 00:22:44.379
you're all sane people right?
So this idea,

00:22:44.379 --> 00:22:47.851
it should be a familiar idea to
you, but it's not just an idea

00:22:47.851 --> 00:22:50.470
in the sort of trivial world of
bargaining.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:55.089
Notice this idea of reputation
occurs all over the place.

00:22:55.089 --> 00:22:58.425
So another place it occurs,
somewhat grim place it occurs,

00:22:58.425 --> 00:23:01.000
is in the subject of hostage
negotiations.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.671
In the subject of hostage
negotiations,

00:23:03.671 --> 00:23:07.607
when some other country has
seized some hostages from the

00:23:07.607 --> 00:23:09.247
U.S.
or maybe some criminal

00:23:09.247 --> 00:23:12.088
organization has seized some
members of your family or some

00:23:12.088 --> 00:23:14.880
members of your community and is
holding the hostages,

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.559
there's a well known idea which
is what?

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:22.107
Which is that you should never
negotiate with hostage takers,

00:23:22.107 --> 00:23:24.549
is that right?
Everyone's heard that idea?

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:26.670
You should never negotiate with
hostage takers.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.940
You never give in just because
they have hostages.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.379
Why?
It's the same idea:

00:23:31.379 --> 00:23:34.820
because you want to have a
reputation for being somebody

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.638
who doesn't give in to hostage
takers in order to deter future

00:23:38.638 --> 00:23:41.829
potential hostage takers from
taking hostages.

00:23:41.829 --> 00:23:45.441
This has grim consequences but
sometimes it's worth bearing the

00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:48.936
cost of having your relatives
come back in pieces in order to

00:23:48.936 --> 00:23:51.500
deter future relatives from
being taken.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.460
So that's a somewhat macabre
version of this.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.000
Let me give you one other
version.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.923
There are whole areas of the
economy where reputation is

00:23:58.923 --> 00:24:01.527
crucial, where if people played
according to their

00:24:01.527 --> 00:24:04.253
backward-induction,
sane incentives,

00:24:04.253 --> 00:24:07.996
we'd have a disaster.
But having a reputation here

00:24:07.996 --> 00:24:10.809
isn't necessarily a reputation
as a tough guy.

00:24:10.809 --> 00:24:16.230
It could be a reputation for
somebody who's a nice guy.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:19.895
Could be that you want to have
a reputation for being the sort

00:24:19.895 --> 00:24:22.839
of person who derives pleasure
or utility from,

00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:25.759
(quote) "doing the right
thing," from acting honestly.

00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:29.000
So think about certain
professions where the reputation

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.700
of the person in the profession
is crucial.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.134
Doctors, for example:
it's crucial for a doctor that

00:24:35.134 --> 00:24:39.309
he or she has the reputation of
someone who tells the truth.

00:24:39.309 --> 00:24:41.710
Otherwise, you'd stop going to
that doctor.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.977
Accountants:
accounting firms rely on having

00:24:44.977 --> 00:24:49.460
a reputation for being honest
and not cheating the books.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.884
When they stop having that
reputation for being

00:24:51.884 --> 00:24:55.204
honest--think of Arthur Anderson
after the events in Enron--they

00:24:55.204 --> 00:24:57.470
pretty quickly cease to be in
business.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.590
I gave that example a couple of
years ago, and it was very

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.822
embarrassing because it turned
out Arthur Anderson was in the

00:25:01.822 --> 00:25:03.980
class--literally Arthur Anderson
III was in the class.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.214
These things happen at Yale.
But nevertheless,

00:25:06.214 --> 00:25:10.049
Arthur Anderson relied on his
reputation, the firm relied on

00:25:10.049 --> 00:25:12.390
its reputation as an honest
firm,

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.606
and it was worth behaving
honestly to maintain that

00:25:15.606 --> 00:25:19.898
reputation for future business.
Reputation is a huge topic and

00:25:19.898 --> 00:25:24.164
my guess is that the next time
there's a Nobel Prize in game

00:25:24.164 --> 00:25:29.599
theory it'll be for this idea.
So that's my prediction.

00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:32.872
Now having said that,
I want to spend the whole of

00:25:32.872 --> 00:25:36.880
the rest of today playing one
game and analyzing one game.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.596
So we're going to play this
game and for this game I need a

00:25:40.596 --> 00:25:43.866
couple of volunteers.
So I'm going to pull out some

00:25:43.866 --> 00:25:46.410
volunteers.
Anyone want to volunteer?

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:50.160
I need two volunteers for this
game.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.799
How about my guy from the
football team,

00:25:51.799 --> 00:25:54.016
was that a raised hand?
It wasn't a raised hand,

00:25:54.016 --> 00:25:56.010
how about my guy from the
football team?

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.235
Is it football team?
Baseball team,

00:25:58.235 --> 00:26:01.269
that may be unfair in this
particular game.

00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:05.099
Maybe I'll take someone who
isn't on the baseball team.

00:26:05.099 --> 00:26:07.420
Anyone who's on the football
team?

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.120
These guys, you guys on the
football team?

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:15.618
Okay great, so you two guys.
I need you at the front and

00:26:15.618 --> 00:26:19.109
your names are?
Chevy and Patrick.

00:26:19.109 --> 00:26:21.420
So Chevy and Patrick are going
to be our volunteers.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.165
Now the idea of this game is
you guys provided the

00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:27.359
volunteers--wait down here a
second--you guys provided the

00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:30.160
volunteers.
This game involves two

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:35.150
volunteers that you just
provided, and two wet sponges.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.140
I will provide the wet sponges.

00:26:43.009 --> 00:26:44.940
So I have here a couple of
sponges and in a minute I'm

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.543
going to wet them,
and I'll tell you what the

00:26:46.543 --> 00:26:49.905
rules are in a second.
Okay, so I'm going to give one

00:26:49.905 --> 00:26:54.736
of these sponges each to Chevy
and Patrick, and then going to

00:26:54.736 --> 00:26:59.164
position Chevy and Patrick at
either end of this central

00:26:59.164 --> 00:27:01.135
aisle,
of this aisle here,

00:27:01.135 --> 00:27:03.420
and the game is going to be as
follows.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.119
It's important that everyone
listen to the rules here because

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:08.460
I'm going to pick two more
volunteers in a moment.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.670
So the game they're going to
play is as follows.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.584
Each of them has one sponge.
It's crucial they only have one

00:27:13.584 --> 00:27:18.039
sponge.
And they're going to take turns.

00:27:18.039 --> 00:27:20.495
And when it's your turn,
as long as you still have your

00:27:20.495 --> 00:27:22.359
sponge in your hand,
you face a choice.

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:27.296
You can either throw your
sponge at your opponent,

00:27:27.296 --> 00:27:31.830
and if you hit your opponent
you win the game,

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:35.759
or you have to take a step
forward.

00:27:35.759 --> 00:27:40.290
So either you throw the sponge
or you take a step forward.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:45.901
Now there's a crucial rule here.
Each player only has one sponge

00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:50.222
and, once they've thrown that
sponge, they do not get the

00:27:50.222 --> 00:27:53.339
sponge back.
Everyone understand that?

00:27:53.339 --> 00:27:56.730
Once you've thrown the sponge
you do not get the sponge back.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.615
So once again,
if you throw your sponge at

00:27:59.615 --> 00:28:03.696
your opponent and you hit your
opponent then you've won the

00:28:03.696 --> 00:28:07.343
game.
But if you throw your sponge at

00:28:07.343 --> 00:28:12.009
your opponent and you miss,
the game continues.

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:14.086
So let's make sure we
understand that,

00:28:14.086 --> 00:28:17.230
if you throw your sponge and
miss the game continues:.

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.508
You still have to step forward.
So, what's your opponent going

00:28:19.508 --> 00:28:21.218
to do at that point?
What's your opponent going to

00:28:21.218 --> 00:28:23.301
do?
Let's make sure that our

00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:26.080
football players understand
this.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.374
It wasn't meant that way.
They could have been soccer

00:28:30.374 --> 00:28:31.788
players, come on.
Student: I didn't

00:28:31.788 --> 00:28:33.345
appreciate that very much
Professor Ben Polak:

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:34.740
I'm sorry I didn't mean it
that way.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.624
So if your opponent whose name
is Patrick throws and misses,

00:28:39.624 --> 00:28:42.724
what are you going to do?
Student: I'll walk

00:28:42.724 --> 00:28:44.279
forward until I slam the sponge
in his face.

00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:46.242
Professor Ben Polak:
Great, you will walk forward

00:28:46.242 --> 00:28:47.670
until you politely put it on his
head.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.663
Everyone understand?
That, if in fact,

00:28:49.663 --> 00:28:52.831
you throw and miss you've lost
the game, because the other guy

00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:55.740
can wait until he's standing
right on top of you and just

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.869
place the sponge gently on his
head.

00:28:57.869 --> 00:29:00.605
Now for fairness sake,
it's important that these

00:29:00.605 --> 00:29:03.631
sponges are equally weighted,
and I'm going to weight

00:29:03.631 --> 00:29:06.250
them--I'm going to put water in
them now.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:09.523
And--you know nothing but the
best for Yale students--I'm

00:29:09.523 --> 00:29:12.329
going to provide Yale University
spring water.

00:29:12.329 --> 00:29:14.280
Who knew that Yale University
had a spring.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:19.058
That's kind of a strange one?
If it makes you feel better you

00:29:19.058 --> 00:29:21.410
can think of this American beer.

00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:29.145
I'm not going to make these too
heavy, partly because it makes

00:29:29.145 --> 00:29:32.829
it too easy and partly because I
don't want to get sued.

00:29:32.829 --> 00:29:39.217
So I'm going to squeeze these
out somewhere away from the

00:29:39.217 --> 00:29:42.643
wires.
We're going to get our judge

00:29:42.643 --> 00:29:46.054
here to weigh them,
I need a mike here,

00:29:46.054 --> 00:29:49.794
let me get a mike.
So I'll need you to hold those

00:29:49.794 --> 00:29:53.690
sponges in your hands and tell
me if they're equally weighted.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.800
Pretty equal?
Okay, they're pretty equal,

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.410
everyone agrees.
So how is this going to work?

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:01.714
I'm going to give the blue
sponge to Chevy and the green

00:30:01.714 --> 00:30:04.742
sponge to Patrick.
And Chevy's going to stand

00:30:04.742 --> 00:30:08.003
here, and Patrick's going to
stand as far back as I can get

00:30:08.003 --> 00:30:10.331
him on camera,
which I'm going to be told how

00:30:10.331 --> 00:30:12.420
far back I can go.
Don't go too far.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.820
Okay come back Patrick,
you're too ambitious.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:23.039
Come back.
Keep coming. stop.

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:26.053
Okay, we're going to start
here--start quite close

00:30:26.053 --> 00:30:28.446
actually.
Everyone understand how we're

00:30:28.446 --> 00:30:31.680
going to play this?
So Chevy is Player 1,

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.048
Patrick is Player 2.
Chevy has to decide whether to

00:30:36.048 --> 00:30:39.009
throw or to step.
Student: I'll step.

00:30:39.009 --> 00:30:40.467
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, let's just hold the game a

00:30:40.467 --> 00:30:41.670
second.
Now its Patrick's turn.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.340
Does anyone have any advice for
Patrick at this point?

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:52.500
If you think throw,
raise your hand.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.099
If you think step,
raise your hand.

00:30:56.099 --> 00:30:57.220
There's a lot more steps than
throws.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.740
I thought the Yale football
team was good this year.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:05.616
Your choice, step or throw.
I should announce two other

00:31:05.616 --> 00:31:06.990
rules.
It's kind of important I should

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:09.226
have said this.
First, a step has to be a

00:31:09.226 --> 00:31:13.367
proper step, like a yard long;
and second (I think this will

00:31:13.367 --> 00:31:16.040
work in America):
gentleman never duck.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.630
No dodging the sponge okay.
Chevy: your turn.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:24.620
Student: I don't really
trust my arm.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.331
I'm going to step.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:31:27.331 --> 00:31:29.930
right, so you're stepping again.
Let me go to Patrick.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:33.539
I feel like I'm in the line of
fire here.

00:31:33.539 --> 00:31:34.519
Patrick what are you going to
do?

00:31:34.519 --> 00:31:34.670
Student: I'm going to
throw.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:36.606
Professor Ben Polak:
Patrick's going to throw,

00:31:36.606 --> 00:31:38.320
I'm really going to get out of
the way then.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.230
We'll see this in slow motion.

00:31:45.849 --> 00:31:50.540
Continue, all right so you have
to take a step forward,

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.970
so Chevy's going to take a step
forward I assume?

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.430
Patrick's going to take a step
forward.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:59.980
Chevy's going to take a step
forward.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.470
Patrick's going to take a step
forward.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:12.875
Good, so a round of applause
for our players,

00:32:12.875 --> 00:32:15.792
thank you.
So I think we have time to do

00:32:15.792 --> 00:32:17.541
this once more,
and then we're going to analyze

00:32:17.541 --> 00:32:18.954
it.
So I want to get two women

00:32:18.954 --> 00:32:20.980
involved.
It's too sexist otherwise.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:26.099
So can we have two women in the
class please?

00:32:26.099 --> 00:32:28.560
Two volunteers,
come on, you can volunteer.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.560
There's a volunteer.
Thank you great.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:35.640
Okay great, thank you.
So your name is?

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.542
Student: Jessica.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:32:37.542 --> 00:32:39.652
Jessica and your name is?
Student: Clara-Elise.

00:32:39.652 --> 00:32:41.740
Professor Ben Polak:
Clara-Elise and Jessica.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.064
We'll start at the same
positions, we'll use the same

00:32:44.064 --> 00:32:46.612
sponges, and I just need to
remind you where that position

00:32:46.612 --> 00:32:48.570
was.
Just give me a thumbs up when

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:51.662
I'm in the right position.
Good, same rules,

00:32:51.662 --> 00:32:55.630
Clara-Elise and Jessica.
We'll let Jessica be Player 1.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:58.160
So Jessica you can step or
throw, what do you want to do?

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:58.710
Student: I'm going to
step.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.392
Professor Ben Polak:
Going to step,

00:33:00.392 --> 00:33:01.914
okay.
You know what might be a good

00:33:01.914 --> 00:33:04.170
idea: Ale why don't you put the
mike on Clara-Elise.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.160
So we have a mike at either end
rather than running to and fro,

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.892
that's good.
So Clara-Elise what are you

00:33:07.892 --> 00:33:09.433
going to do?
Student: I'm going to

00:33:09.433 --> 00:33:10.488
step.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:12.500
You're going to step and Jessica
what are you going to do?

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.580
Student: I'm going to
step.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.250
Professor Ben Polak:
You're going to step.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.850
Ale and I are in danger here
but never mind.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.366
Any votes now?
Do people think that Jessica

00:33:20.366 --> 00:33:22.842
should throw?
If you think she should throw

00:33:22.842 --> 00:33:25.281
raise your hands.
There's a large majority for

00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:26.256
step.
So up to you,

00:33:26.256 --> 00:33:29.741
what are you going to do?
Student: I'm going to

00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:31.114
step.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:33:31.114 --> 00:33:34.589
Going to step okay.
Clara-Elise any decisions?

00:33:34.589 --> 00:33:38.049
It's a pretty light sponge,
It's pretty hard to throw the

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:43.109
sponge, because we've seen that.
Okay, stepping again.

00:33:43.109 --> 00:33:46.460
Student: I'm going to
throw.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.665
Professor Ben Polak:
You're going to throw okay,

00:33:48.665 --> 00:33:50.300
here we go, let me get out of
the way.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:55.560
Oh okay, continue please.
Clara-Elise's turn.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.847
Student: I'll step.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:33:57.847 --> 00:33:59.470
You'll step.
Jessica has to step,

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.890
Clara-Elise has to step,
all right good.

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:06.334
So we've seen how the game
works, everyone understands how

00:34:06.334 --> 00:34:09.789
the game works.
I want to spend the rest of

00:34:09.789 --> 00:34:13.572
today analyzing this game.
Before I do so,

00:34:13.572 --> 00:34:18.530
we should just talk about what
this game is.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:23.130
Let me get some new boards down
here.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.629
So one quick announcement:
I'm going to analyze this,

00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:33.390
and we're going to spend the
rest of today analyzing this,

00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.280
but this is going to be quite
hard.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.235
So I'm going to provide you a
handout that I'll put on the web

00:34:38.235 --> 00:34:40.610
probably tomorrow that goes over
this argument.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:42.517
So you don't have to take
detailed notes now,

00:34:42.517 --> 00:34:44.946
I want you to pay attention and
see if you can follow the

00:34:44.946 --> 00:34:48.017
argument.
So this game is called duel,

00:34:48.017 --> 00:34:52.227
not surprisingly,
and you may wonder what are we

00:34:52.227 --> 00:34:57.512
doing--as are my colleagues that
are here--what are we doing

00:34:57.512 --> 00:35:00.857
having a duel in class.
Of course one answer to that

00:35:00.857 --> 00:35:02.592
is, it's kind of fun watching
the future leaders of America

00:35:02.592 --> 00:35:04.473
throw wet sponges at each other.
That's probably reason in

00:35:04.473 --> 00:35:06.570
itself.
But there are other reasons.

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:11.219
Duel is a real game.
So those of you who are well

00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:15.759
versed in Russian literature
will have seen duals before,

00:35:15.759 --> 00:35:19.237
or at least read of duals.
There are some famous duels in

00:35:19.237 --> 00:35:21.374
Russian literature.
Anyone want to tell me some

00:35:21.374 --> 00:35:23.220
famous duels in Russian
literature?

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.809
Any Russian majors here?
No, nobody want to give me a

00:35:26.809 --> 00:35:29.420
shot at this?
Really nobody.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.246
This is Yale, come on.
Well, how about in War and

00:35:32.246 --> 00:35:34.082
Peace okay.
There's a duel like this in War

00:35:34.082 --> 00:35:36.632
and Peace, and in War and Peace
and without giving away the

00:35:36.632 --> 00:35:39.226
ending--actually it's in the
middle of the book and it's 800

00:35:39.226 --> 00:35:41.030
pages long,
so it isn't exactly the ending.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:44.404
But in War and Peace I think
we're led to believe that the

00:35:44.404 --> 00:35:47.933
hero, the protagonist Pierre,
shoots his gun--in War and

00:35:47.933 --> 00:35:51.581
Peace it's a gun and not a
sponge, no surprise--he shoots

00:35:51.581 --> 00:35:54.320
his gun too early,
we're led to believe.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.830
There's a famous one in Eugene
Onegin, in Pushkin's Eugene

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:58.812
Onegin, and there are lots of
others actually,

00:35:58.812 --> 00:36:02.137
so there's lots in literature.
There are also settings which

00:36:02.137 --> 00:36:04.280
aren't exactly out of
literature.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.699
So one example would be in a
bike race.

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:11.219
How many of you ever watch the
Tour de France?

00:36:11.219 --> 00:36:12.480
Everyone know what I mean by
the Tour de France.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.490
So this is a bike race that
goes around France.

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:18.992
It takes stages.
And in the Tour de France,

00:36:18.992 --> 00:36:22.103
there's a key decision.
There's a game within the game,

00:36:22.103 --> 00:36:24.914
and the game within the
game--I'm looking at Jake who's

00:36:24.914 --> 00:36:27.985
a real cyclist here--but the
game within the game is when do

00:36:27.985 --> 00:36:30.120
you try to break away from the
pack,

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.189
which is called the peloton.
And if you break away too early

00:36:33.189 --> 00:36:35.645
from the peloton,
it turns out that you're going

00:36:35.645 --> 00:36:38.123
to get reeled in.
It turns out that over the long

00:36:38.123 --> 00:36:40.250
haul the peloton can go much
faster than you.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.960
So if you break too early
they're going to catch you up.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.620
On the other hand,
if you break too late,

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.862
then you're going to lose
because there are going to be

00:36:46.862 --> 00:36:49.519
some people in the peloton who
are just excellent sprinters.

00:36:49.519 --> 00:36:52.875
So if you break too late the
sprinters are going to win the

00:36:52.875 --> 00:36:55.200
race.
So you have to decide when to

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.193
break from the peloton.
This is the second most

00:36:58.193 --> 00:37:01.245
important game within a game in
the Tour de France,

00:37:01.245 --> 00:37:04.785
the most important game within
a game is where to hide your

00:37:04.785 --> 00:37:09.393
steroids.
So let me give you one other

00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:12.033
example.
Let me give you a more economic

00:37:12.033 --> 00:37:14.159
example--it's meant to be an
economics class.

00:37:14.159 --> 00:37:17.325
Imagine there's two firms,
and these two firms are both

00:37:17.325 --> 00:37:20.079
engaged in R&amp;D,
research and development.

00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:23.578
And they're trying to develop a
new product, and they're going

00:37:23.578 --> 00:37:26.159
to launch this new product onto
the market.

00:37:26.159 --> 00:37:28.861
But the nature of this market
is--maybe it's a network

00:37:28.861 --> 00:37:32.021
good--the nature of this market
is there's only going to be one

00:37:32.021 --> 00:37:34.852
successful good out there.
So essentially there's going to

00:37:34.852 --> 00:37:36.702
be one standard,
let's say of a software or a

00:37:36.702 --> 00:37:38.887
technological standard,
and only one of them is going

00:37:38.887 --> 00:37:40.980
to survive.
The problem is you haven't

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.596
perfected your product yet.
If you launch your product too

00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:48.072
early it may not work,
and then consumers are never

00:37:48.072 --> 00:37:51.348
going to trust you again.
But if you launch it too late

00:37:51.348 --> 00:37:53.227
the other side will have
launched already,

00:37:53.227 --> 00:37:56.159
they will have got a toehold in
the market, and you're toast.

00:37:56.159 --> 00:38:00.391
So that game--that game about
product launch--is like duel,

00:38:00.391 --> 00:38:04.477
except you're launching a
product rather than launching a

00:38:04.477 --> 00:38:06.800
sponge.
Is that right?

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.301
Now all of these games have a
common feature,

00:38:09.301 --> 00:38:12.590
and it's a new feature for us.
It's about the nature of the

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.118
strategic decision.
In most of the games we've

00:38:15.118 --> 00:38:18.588
looked at in the course so far
the strategic decision has been

00:38:18.588 --> 00:38:20.750
of the form: where should I
locate,

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:23.680
how much should I do,
what price should I set,

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.090
should I stand for election or
not?

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:31.943
Here the strategic decision is
not of the form what should I

00:38:31.943 --> 00:38:33.970
do.
It's of the form what?

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:37.343
When?
It's of the form when am

00:38:37.343 --> 00:38:40.188
I going to launch the sponge?
We know perfectly well what

00:38:40.188 --> 00:38:41.850
you're going to do.
You're going to throw the

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:44.251
sponge.
The strategic issue in question

00:38:44.251 --> 00:38:47.570
is when.
So the issue here is when.

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:54.985
So to analyze this,
I'm going to need a little bit

00:38:54.985 --> 00:38:57.000
of notation, and let me put that
notation up now.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.412
So in particular,
I want to use the notation,

00:39:02.412 --> 00:39:04.750
Pi[d]
to be what?

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:18.075
Let Pi[d]
be Player i's probability of

00:39:18.075 --> 00:39:31.039
hitting if i shoots at distance
d.

00:39:31.039 --> 00:39:33.894
So Pi[d]
is the probability that i will

00:39:33.894 --> 00:39:36.900
hit if he or she shoots at
distance d.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.500
Everyone happy with that?
That's the only notation I'm

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.664
going to use today.
And I'm going to make some

00:39:42.664 --> 00:39:45.000
assumptions about the nature of
this probability.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.960
Two of the assumptions are
pretty innocent.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:52.873
So let's draw a picture.
So the picture is going to look

00:39:52.873 --> 00:39:54.898
like this.
Here's a graph,

00:39:54.898 --> 00:39:58.369
and on the horizontal axis I'm
going to put d.

00:39:58.369 --> 00:40:01.849
This is the distance apart of
the two players.

00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:07.529
And on the vertical axis I'm
going to put P which is the

00:40:07.529 --> 00:40:12.614
probability, Pr the probability.
So here they're at distance 0,

00:40:12.614 --> 00:40:15.187
and I'm going to make an
assumption about what the

00:40:15.187 --> 00:40:17.970
probability of hitting is if
you're at distance 0.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:20.531
What's the sensible assumption?
What's the probability of

00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:23.353
hitting somebody with your
sponge if you're 0 distance

00:40:23.353 --> 00:40:26.480
away?
1, okay, I agree, so 1.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.317
So the first assumption I'm
going to make is,

00:40:28.317 --> 00:40:30.948
if they're right on top of each
other, they're going to hit with

00:40:30.948 --> 00:40:34.427
probability 1.
Now the second assumption I'm

00:40:34.427 --> 00:40:38.658
going to make is:
as you get further away this

00:40:38.658 --> 00:40:41.893
probability decreases.
It doesn't have to look exactly

00:40:41.893 --> 00:40:42.889
like this but something like
that.

00:40:42.889 --> 00:40:45.019
That also I think--Is that an
okay assumption?

00:40:45.019 --> 00:40:49.070
As you're further away there's
a lower probability of hitting.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.550
Now I'm not going to assume
that these two players have

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:54.960
equal abilities.
For example, I don't know;

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.537
I didn't ask them but one of
our two football players might

00:40:57.537 --> 00:41:00.204
be a quarterback and the other
one might be a linebacker or a

00:41:00.204 --> 00:41:02.324
running back.
And I'm assuming the

00:41:02.324 --> 00:41:06.010
quarterback is probably more
accurate, is that right?

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.758
So I'm not going to assume that
they're equally good,

00:41:08.758 --> 00:41:11.559
so it could be that their
abilities look like this.

00:41:11.559 --> 00:41:18.340
This could be P1[d],
and this could be P2[d].

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:22.016
Everyone okay with that?
So shout this out,

00:41:22.016 --> 00:41:26.275
in this picture,
who is the better shot and who

00:41:26.275 --> 00:41:30.619
is the less good shot?
Who is the better shot?

00:41:30.619 --> 00:41:34.847
1 is the better shot because at
every distance if Player 1 were

00:41:34.847 --> 00:41:39.212
to throw, Player 1's probability
of hitting is higher than Player

00:41:39.212 --> 00:41:41.940
2's probability of hitting as
drawn.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.960
Now, I don't even need to
assume this.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.719
It could well be that these
probabilities cross.

00:41:47.719 --> 00:41:51.010
It could be that these curves
cross.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:53.646
So it could be that Player 1 is
better at close distances,

00:41:53.646 --> 00:41:55.590
but Player 2 is better at far
distances.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.262
That's fine.
We'll assume it's like this

00:41:57.262 --> 00:41:58.540
today but I'm not going to use
that.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:03.235
I could do away with that.
As drawn, Player 1 is the

00:42:03.235 --> 00:42:05.369
better shot.
Now I'm going to make one

00:42:05.369 --> 00:42:07.447
assumption that matters,
and it's really a critical

00:42:07.447 --> 00:42:09.118
assumption.
I'm going to make the

00:42:09.118 --> 00:42:11.969
assumption because it keeps the
math simple for today.

00:42:11.969 --> 00:42:13.469
We have enough math to do
anyway.

00:42:13.469 --> 00:42:18.510
I'm going to assume that these
abilities are known.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:22.841
I'm going to assume that not
only do you know your own

00:42:22.841 --> 00:42:27.010
ability of hitting your opponent
at any distance.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:30.481
I'm going to assume you also
know the ability of your

00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:31.950
opponent to hit you.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:38.370
Now let's look at this a second.
We've got a little bit of

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:41.949
notation on the board,
let's discuss this a second.

00:42:41.949 --> 00:42:43.590
What do we think is going to
happen here?

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:47.312
In this particular example we
have a good shot and a less good

00:42:47.312 --> 00:42:49.515
shot.
Who do we think is going to

00:42:49.515 --> 00:42:53.418
shoot first?
Let's try and cold call some

00:42:53.418 --> 00:42:56.840
people.
So you sir what's your name?

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.567
Student: Frank.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:42:58.567 --> 00:43:00.330
Frank, so who do you think is
going to shoot first,

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:01.670
the better shot or the worse
shot?

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:06.275
Student: The better shot
but also depends on who steps

00:43:06.275 --> 00:43:07.990
first.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:10.110
Okay, let's assume Player 1 is
going to step first.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.247
Student: Player 1.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:43:12.247 --> 00:43:14.520
Frank thinks Player 1 is going
to shoot first because Player 1

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.340
is the better shot.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.489
Let's see, so what's your name?
Student: Nick.

00:43:21.489 --> 00:43:22.696
Professor Ben Polak:
Nick, who do you think is going

00:43:22.696 --> 00:43:24.155
to shoot first?
Student: I think Player

00:43:24.155 --> 00:43:25.941
2 would shoot first.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:43:25.941 --> 00:43:28.120
right, so let's talk why.
Why do you think Player 1 was

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.780
going to shoot first?
Let's do a poll.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.177
How many of you think the
better shot's going to shoot

00:43:35.177 --> 00:43:37.467
first?
How many people think the worse

00:43:37.467 --> 00:43:40.051
shot's going to shoot first?
How many people of you are

00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:42.980
being chickens and abstaining?
Quite a few okay.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:47.079
So why do we think the better
shot might shoot first?

00:43:47.079 --> 00:43:50.228
Student: At equal
distance, he has a better chance

00:43:50.228 --> 00:43:52.082
of hitting.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:43:52.082 --> 00:43:54.659
Because he has a better chance
of hitting, but why do you think

00:43:54.659 --> 00:43:56.530
that the less good shot might
shoot first?

00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:01.094
Student: He knows that
if P1 gets too close he's going

00:44:01.094 --> 00:44:04.365
to win anyway,
so he may as well take a shot

00:44:04.365 --> 00:44:08.228
with lower chance before P1.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:44:08.228 --> 00:44:10.163
right, okay so you have two
arguments here,

00:44:10.163 --> 00:44:12.881
the first argument is maybe the
better shot will shoot first

00:44:12.881 --> 00:44:14.930
because,
after all, he has a higher

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:17.512
chance of hitting.
And the other argument says

00:44:17.512 --> 00:44:20.219
maybe the worse shot will shoot
first, to what?

00:44:20.219 --> 00:44:23.739
To pre-empt the better shot
from shooting him.

00:44:23.739 --> 00:44:26.415
But now we get more
complicated, because after all,

00:44:26.415 --> 00:44:29.465
if you're the better shot and
you know that the worse shot

00:44:29.465 --> 00:44:32.515
maybe going to try and shoot
first to try and pre-empt you

00:44:32.515 --> 00:44:35.245
from shooting him,
you might be tempted to shoot

00:44:35.245 --> 00:44:38.135
before the worse shot shoots to
preempt the worse shot from

00:44:38.135 --> 00:44:39.980
pre-empting you from shooting
him.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.588
And if you're the worse shot
maybe you're going to try and

00:44:42.588 --> 00:44:45.006
shoot first, even earlier,
to pre-empt the better shot

00:44:45.006 --> 00:44:47.491
from pre-empting the worse shot,
from pre-empting the better

00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:49.469
shot from shooting the worse
shot and so on.

00:44:49.469 --> 00:44:53.670
So what's clear is that this
game has a lot to do with

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:57.756
pre-emption.
Pre-emption's a big idea here,

00:44:57.756 --> 00:45:03.214
but I claim it's not at all
obvious who's going to shoot

00:45:03.214 --> 00:45:07.580
first, the better shot or the
worse shot.

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.706
Is that right?
So those people who abstained

00:45:09.706 --> 00:45:11.491
raise your hands again.
Those people who abstained

00:45:11.491 --> 00:45:13.769
before, it seemed like it was a
pretty sensible time to abstain.

00:45:13.769 --> 00:45:16.840
It's not obvious at all to me
who's going to shoot first here.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.350
Are people convinced at least
that it's a hard problem?

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.542
Yes or no, people convinced?
Yeah okay good.

00:45:24.542 --> 00:45:28.314
It's a hard problem.
So what I want to do is,

00:45:28.314 --> 00:45:33.262
as a class, as a group,
what I want us to do is solve

00:45:33.262 --> 00:45:36.365
this game;
and I want to solve not just

00:45:36.365 --> 00:45:40.095
who is going to shoot first,
I want to figure out exactly

00:45:40.095 --> 00:45:43.837
when they're going to shoot.
So we're going to do this in

00:45:43.837 --> 00:45:47.072
the next half hour and we're
going to do it as a class,

00:45:47.072 --> 00:45:50.530
so you're going to do it.
So we're going to nail this

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:53.695
problem basically,
and we're going to do it using

00:45:53.695 --> 00:45:57.077
two kinds of arguments.
One kind of argument is an

00:45:57.077 --> 00:46:00.541
argument we learned the very
first day of the class and

00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:03.993
that's a dominance argument,
and the second kind of argument

00:46:03.993 --> 00:46:06.590
is an argument we've been using
a little bit recently,

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:08.660
and what kind of argument is
that?

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.690
What is it?
Backward induction.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:13.755
So we're going to use dominance
arguments and backward

00:46:13.755 --> 00:46:16.092
induction, and we're going to
figure out not just whether the

00:46:16.092 --> 00:46:18.079
better shot or the worse shot's
going to shoot,

00:46:18.079 --> 00:46:22.469
but exactly who's going to
shoot when.

00:46:22.469 --> 00:46:25.557
Let's keep our picture handy,
get rid of, well I can get this

00:46:25.557 --> 00:46:26.330
down I guess.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:39.352
Can you still see the picture?
All right, let's proceed with

00:46:39.352 --> 00:46:43.692
this argument.
So to do this argument,

00:46:43.692 --> 00:46:49.690
I first of all want to
establish a couple of facts.

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:57.829
I want to establish two facts,
and we'll call the first fact:

00:46:57.829 --> 00:47:00.995
Fact A.
Let's go back to our two

00:47:00.995 --> 00:47:03.668
players we had before.
In fact, maybe it would be

00:47:03.668 --> 00:47:05.908
helpful to have our players.
Can I use our first two players

00:47:05.908 --> 00:47:10.110
as props.
Can I have you guys on stage?

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:13.674
While they're coming up--sorry
guys, I'm exploiting you a bit

00:47:13.674 --> 00:47:15.809
today.
I hope you both signed your

00:47:15.809 --> 00:47:18.904
legal release forms.
Why don't you guys sit here a

00:47:18.904 --> 00:47:21.019
second so I can use you as
props.

00:47:21.019 --> 00:47:26.680
So imagine that these two guys
still have their sponges.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.952
Let's actually set this up.
So suppose that Chevy still has

00:47:30.952 --> 00:47:34.829
a sponge, and Patrick still has
his sponge.

00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:38.746
And suppose it's Chevy's turn,
and suppose that Chevy is

00:47:38.746 --> 00:47:43.090
trying to decide whether he
should throw his sponge or not.

00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:49.612
Let me give you a mike each so
you have them for future

00:47:49.612 --> 00:47:51.837
reference.
So Chevy is trying to decide

00:47:51.837 --> 00:47:54.019
whether to throw his sponge or
not.

00:47:54.019 --> 00:48:01.576
Now suppose that Chevy knows
that Patrick is not going to

00:48:01.576 --> 00:48:06.570
shoot next turn when it's his
turn.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:09.760
So Chevy's trying to decide
whether to shoot and he knows

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.007
that Patrick is not going to
shoot next turn when it's his

00:48:13.007 --> 00:48:14.350
turn.
What should Chevy do?

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.079
Chevy what should you do?
Student: Take a step.

00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:17.860
Professor Ben Polak:
Take a step, that's right.

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:19.231
Why should he take a step?
What's the argument?

00:48:19.231 --> 00:48:20.661
Why he should take a step?
Well let's find out:

00:48:20.661 --> 00:48:24.433
what's the argument?
Student: Because I'll

00:48:24.433 --> 00:48:30.697
just be one step closer and I'll
be able to make the same choice

00:48:30.697 --> 00:48:33.009
next time.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:48:33.009 --> 00:48:34.820
Good, hold the mike up to you.
You're a rock star now.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:39.306
All right good,
he's correctly saying he should

00:48:39.306 --> 00:48:45.379
wait, why should he wait?
Because he's going to be closer

00:48:45.379 --> 00:48:51.851
next time.
So the first fact is:

00:48:51.851 --> 00:49:06.355
assuming no one has thrown yet,
if Player i knows (at (say)

00:49:06.355 --> 00:49:21.860
distance d) that j will not
shoot--let me call it tomorrow;

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:29.757
and tomorrow he'll be closer,
he'll be at distance d -

00:49:29.757 --> 00:49:38.250
1--then Chevy correctly says,
I should not shoot today.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:41.585
Again, recall the argument,
the argument is you'll get a

00:49:41.585 --> 00:49:44.800
better shot, a closer shot,
the day after tomorrow.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:52.076
Now, let's turn things around.
Suppose, conversely--once again

00:49:52.076 --> 00:49:56.110
we're picking on Chevy a
second--so Chevy has his sponge.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:50:03.083
No one has thrown yet,
and suppose Chevy knows that

00:50:03.083 --> 00:50:09.220
Patrick is going to throw
tomorrow.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:16.240
Now what should Chevy do?
Well that's a harder decision.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.814
What should Chevy do?
He knows Patrick's going to

00:50:18.814 --> 00:50:20.599
shoot tomorrow.
What should he do?

00:50:20.599 --> 00:50:23.680
Should he shoot or what,
what's the answer this time?

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.150
What do you reckon?
Student: It depends.

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.809
Professor Ben Polak: It
depends.

00:50:25.809 --> 00:50:29.050
I think that's the right
answer: it depends.

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:31.162
Good, so the question
is--someone else,

00:50:31.162 --> 00:50:34.441
I don't want to pick entirely
on these guys--so what does it

00:50:34.441 --> 00:50:37.640
depend on?
It's right that it depends.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.882
What does it depend on?
Student: If the other

00:50:39.882 --> 00:50:42.389
guy's chances are greater than
or less than 50%.

00:50:42.389 --> 00:50:45.393
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so it might depend on the

00:50:45.393 --> 00:50:48.110
other side's chances being less
than or great than 50%.

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.563
It certainly depends on the
other guy's ability and on my

00:50:51.563 --> 00:50:53.690
ability.
Everyone clear on that?

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:56.657
Everyone agrees whether I
should shoot now if I know the

00:50:56.657 --> 00:50:59.354
other guy is going to shoot
tomorrow depends on our

00:50:59.354 --> 00:51:02.053
abilities,
but how exactly does it depend

00:51:02.053 --> 00:51:05.536
on our abilities?
Student: It depends on:

00:51:05.536 --> 00:51:10.322
if you're probability to hit is
greater than his probability to

00:51:10.322 --> 00:51:11.761
miss.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:51:11.761 --> 00:51:12.863
Good, your name is?
Student: Osmont

00:51:12.863 --> 00:51:13.670
Professor Ben Polak:
Osmont.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:17.246
So Osmont is saying--let's be
careful here:

00:51:17.246 --> 00:51:21.589
it depends on whether my
probability of hitting if I

00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:26.442
throw now is bigger than his
probability of missing

00:51:26.442 --> 00:51:29.942
tomorrow.
And why is that the right

00:51:29.942 --> 00:51:32.499
comparison?
That's the right comparison

00:51:32.499 --> 00:51:35.422
because, if I throw now,
my probability of winning the

00:51:35.422 --> 00:51:38.179
game is the probability that I
hit my opponent.

00:51:38.179 --> 00:51:43.145
If I wait and take a step,
then my probability of winning

00:51:43.145 --> 00:51:48.199
the game is the probability that
he misses me tomorrow.

00:51:48.199 --> 00:51:50.713
So I have to compare winning
probabilities with winning

00:51:50.713 --> 00:51:52.714
probabilities:
I have to compare apples with

00:51:52.714 --> 00:51:55.620
apples, not apples with oranges.
Everyone see that?

00:51:55.620 --> 00:52:00.948
Okay, so let's put that up.
So the same assumption:

00:52:00.948 --> 00:52:08.330
assuming no one has thrown,
if i knows (at d) that j

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:14.119
will shoot tomorrow (at
d--1),

00:52:14.119 --> 00:52:23.872
then i should shoot if--need a
gap here--if i's probability of

00:52:23.872 --> 00:52:33.305
hitting at d--and let me leave a
gap here--is bigger than or

00:52:33.305 --> 00:52:42.578
equal to--it doesn't really
matter about the equal case--is

00:52:42.578 --> 00:52:53.289
greater than or equal to j's
probability of missing tomorrow.

00:52:53.289 --> 00:52:57.739
Because this is the probability
that you'll win if you throw,

00:52:57.739 --> 00:53:02.039
and this is the probability
that you'll win if you wait.

00:53:02.039 --> 00:53:06.599
Okay, so let's put in what
those things are.

00:53:06.599 --> 00:53:10.591
So the probability that i will
hit at distance D,

00:53:10.591 --> 00:53:14.665
that's not that hard,
that's Pi[d]--everyone happy

00:53:14.665 --> 00:53:19.367
with that?
What's the probability that j

00:53:19.367 --> 00:53:24.161
will miss tomorrow if j throws?
What's the probability that j

00:53:24.161 --> 00:53:26.480
will miss?
Somebody?

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:34.417
Let's be careful,
so it's 1--Pj--but what

00:53:34.417 --> 00:53:45.530
distance will they be at--d--1:
so it's (1--Pj[d--1]).

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:50.987
So this is the key rule,
if Chevy knows that Patrick's

00:53:50.987 --> 00:53:56.444
going to shoot tomorrow then
Chevy should shoot if his

00:53:56.444 --> 00:54:01.799
probability of hitting Pi[d]
is bigger than Patrick's

00:54:01.799 --> 00:54:06.329
probability of missing (1 -
Pj[d--1]).

00:54:06.329 --> 00:54:08.159
Now I want to do one piece of
math.

00:54:08.159 --> 00:54:11.409
This is the only math in this
proof.

00:54:11.409 --> 00:54:13.586
So everyone who is math phobic,
which I know there is a lot of

00:54:13.586 --> 00:54:15.050
you, can you just hold onto your
seats?

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:17.139
Don't panic:
a little bit of math coming.

00:54:17.139 --> 00:54:22.173
This is the math,
I want to add Pj[d--1]

00:54:22.173 --> 00:54:26.690
to both sides of this
inequality.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:30.840
That's it, so what does that
tell me?

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:35.028
If add Pj[d -1]
to this side,

00:54:35.028 --> 00:54:41.610
I get +Pj[d--1],
everyone happy with that?

00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:49.070
On the other side if I add
Pj[d--1], I get just 1.

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:52.944
Everyone happy with that?
So here's our rule,

00:54:52.944 --> 00:54:55.211
our rule is,
let's flip it around,

00:54:55.211 --> 00:54:59.332
if Patrick hasn't thrown yet
and thinks that Chevy's going to

00:54:59.332 --> 00:55:02.766
shoot tomorrow then Patrick
should shoot now if his

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:06.956
probability of hitting now plus
Chevy's probability of hitting

00:55:06.956 --> 00:55:11.926
tomorrow is bigger than 1.
Let's call this * and let's put

00:55:11.926 --> 00:55:17.390
this stuff up somewhere where we
can use it for future reference.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.860
Sorry guys, I'll use you again
in a minute.

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:28.590
I know you're feeling self
conscious up there.

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:30.579
Believe me, I'm self conscious
up here too.

00:55:30.579 --> 00:55:34.139
So let's look at that *
inequality up there.

00:55:34.139 --> 00:55:39.188
Now way out here,
is that * inequality met or not

00:55:39.188 --> 00:55:39.820
met?

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:45.289
It's not met because way out
here these two probabilities are

00:55:45.289 --> 00:55:46.619
small, so the sum is less than
1.

00:55:46.619 --> 00:55:51.869
In here, is the * inequality
met or not met?

00:55:51.869 --> 00:55:56.752
Let me pick on you guys,
so Patrick is it met or not met

00:55:56.752 --> 00:55:59.060
in here?
Shout into your microphone.

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.398
Student: It's met.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:56:00.398 --> 00:56:02.000
It's met, thank you okay.
So, in here,

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.680
the inequality is met:
the sum is bigger than 1;

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:08.815
and out here it's less than 1.
If we put in all the steps

00:56:08.815 --> 00:56:11.650
here--here they are getting
closer and closer together.

00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:13.917
Here's the steps,
as they get closer and closer

00:56:13.917 --> 00:56:17.239
together.
We put these steps in.

00:56:17.239 --> 00:56:21.436
There's going to be some step
where, for the first time,

00:56:21.436 --> 00:56:24.754
the * inequality is met.
Notice that they start out

00:56:24.754 --> 00:56:27.115
here, they get closer and
closer, it's not met,

00:56:27.115 --> 00:56:28.414
not met,
not met, not met,

00:56:28.414 --> 00:56:30.317
not met, not met,
then suddenly it's going to

00:56:30.317 --> 00:56:31.659
met.
Maybe around here.

00:56:31.659 --> 00:56:36.670
Let's just try and pick it out,
maybe it's here.

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:41.984
So this might be the first time
that this * inequality is met,

00:56:41.984 --> 00:56:45.320
let's call it d*.
Everyone understand what D* is?

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.543
At every one of these steps to
the right of d*,

00:56:48.543 --> 00:56:51.626
when we take the sum of the
probability Pi[d]

00:56:51.626 --> 00:56:54.780
+ Pj[d--1], we get something
less than 1.

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.342
But to the left of d* or closer
in than d*--the game is

00:56:57.342 --> 00:57:00.000
proceeding this way because it's
moving right to left,

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.142
they're getting closer and
closer--to the left of d* the

00:57:03.142 --> 00:57:05.769
sum of those probabilities is
bigger than 1.

00:57:05.769 --> 00:57:09.455
Let's say that again,
d* is the first step at which

00:57:09.455 --> 00:57:12.920
the sum of those two
probabilities exceeds 1.

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:16.769
Everyone okay about what d* is?
Anyone want to ask me a

00:57:16.769 --> 00:57:18.442
question?
Okay, people should feel free

00:57:18.442 --> 00:57:20.647
to ask questions on this,
I want to make sure everyone is

00:57:20.647 --> 00:57:22.740
following.
Is everyone following so far?

00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:25.260
Yeah?
I need to see all your eyes.

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.100
You don't look like you're
stuck in the headlamps like you

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.063
were on Monday.
I think we're better off than

00:57:29.063 --> 00:57:31.250
we were on Monday.
Good okay.

00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:35.895
Okay, so here's our picture,
and I actually want a bit more

00:57:35.895 --> 00:57:39.660
space--I'm not going to have
much more space.

00:57:45.639 --> 00:57:48.449
So now I'm going to tell you
the solution.

00:57:48.449 --> 00:57:52.190
The solution to this game is
this.

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:59.080
I claim that the first shot
should occur at d*.

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:00.880
So that's my claim.

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:13.446
No one should shoot until you
get to d*, and whoever's turn it

00:58:13.446 --> 00:58:20.479
is--whether it's Chevy's turn or
Patrick's turn at d*--that

00:58:20.479 --> 00:58:24.311
person should shoot.
That's my claim,

00:58:24.311 --> 00:58:26.500
and that's what we're going to
prove.

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:30.357
Everyone understand the claim?
It says: nobody shoots,

00:58:30.357 --> 00:58:32.984
nobody shoots,
nobody shoots,

00:58:32.984 --> 00:58:35.610
nobody shoots,
nobody shoots,

00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:38.050
nobody shoots,
shoot.

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:40.480
Let's prove it,
everyone ready to prove it?

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.791
Yeah, people should be awake.
If your neighbor's not awake,

00:58:43.791 --> 00:58:46.933
nudge them hard.
Good, all right,

00:58:46.933 --> 00:58:53.900
let's start this analysis way
out here, miles apart.

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:57.699
These guys are miles apart and
I want to use them as props.

00:58:57.699 --> 00:58:59.554
So I've got these guys--stay
where you are Patrick but stand

00:58:59.554 --> 00:59:01.282
up, and Chevy over here
somewhere, just where that black

00:59:01.282 --> 00:59:03.310
line is.
Maybe they're even further than

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:05.170
this.
They're really far apart.

00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:08.372
And here they are miles away,
and let's say it's Chevy's

00:59:08.372 --> 00:59:10.533
turn.
He's way out here:

00:59:10.533 --> 00:59:14.039
perhaps the first step of the
game.

00:59:14.039 --> 00:59:16.445
Imagine it's even further
because it was even further,

00:59:16.445 --> 00:59:19.031
and let's think through what
should be going on in Chevy's

00:59:19.031 --> 00:59:20.800
head.
There are two possible things

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.424
going on.
He's going to think about what

00:59:22.424 --> 00:59:24.090
Patrick's going to do.
So this is Chevy's turn.

00:59:24.090 --> 00:59:26.776
Here he is.
And he should think:

00:59:26.776 --> 00:59:29.454
tomorrow, it's going to be
Patrick's turn,

00:59:29.454 --> 00:59:34.375
and there's two possibilities.
One possibility is that Patrick

00:59:34.375 --> 00:59:39.591
is not going to shoot tomorrow.
And if we think that Patrick is

00:59:39.591 --> 00:59:44.010
not going to shoot tomorrow,
which fact should Chevy use?

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:47.848
Should he use Fact A or Fact B?
Chevy which fact should you

00:59:47.848 --> 00:59:49.059
use?
Student: Fact A.

00:59:49.059 --> 00:59:49.900
Professor Ben Polak:
Fact A, okay.

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:53.150
So, using Fact A,
he should not shoot.

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:56.067
Alternatively,
he could think that Patrick's

00:59:56.067 --> 00:59:58.849
going to shoot tomorrow,
is that right?

00:59:58.849 --> 01:00:00.139
He could think Patrick's going
to shoot tomorrow.

01:00:00.139 --> 01:00:02.603
If he thinks Patrick's going to
shoot tomorrow,

01:00:02.603 --> 01:00:04.210
which fact should he use?
B.

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:08.908
He should use Fact B,
in which case he has to look at

01:00:08.908 --> 01:00:13.937
this inequality up here and say,
I'll shoot if my probability of

01:00:13.937 --> 01:00:17.788
hitting now plus his probability
of hitting tomorrow is bigger

01:00:17.788 --> 01:00:20.230
than 1.
Well let's have a look.

01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:26.495
This is Patrick's probability
of hitting today and this is

01:00:26.495 --> 01:00:31.442
Chevy's probability
of--sorry--this is Chevy's

01:00:31.442 --> 01:00:35.785
probability of hitting today,
and this is Patrick's

01:00:35.785 --> 01:00:39.230
probability of hitting tomorrow.
And is the sum of them bigger

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:41.830
than 1 or not?
Is it bigger than 1 or not?

01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:45.200
It's not bigger than 1.
So what should Chevy do?

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.940
He should step.
So he'd step.

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:50.902
Now it's Patrick's turn,
and once again,

01:00:50.902 --> 01:00:54.169
imagine this distance is still
pretty large,

01:00:54.169 --> 01:00:57.739
and there's two things Patrick
could think.

01:00:57.739 --> 01:01:02.748
Patrick could think that
Chevy's not going to shoot

01:01:02.748 --> 01:01:05.084
tomorrow.
So here's Patrick,

01:01:05.084 --> 01:01:08.992
he's looking forward to Chevy
tomorrow, and he could think

01:01:08.992 --> 01:01:12.010
that Chevy's not going to shoot
tomorrow.

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:13.704
If he thinks Chevy's not going
to shoot tomorrow which fact

01:01:13.704 --> 01:01:14.637
should he choose?
Student: A.

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:15.642
Professor Ben Polak:
Should choose Fact A,

01:01:15.642 --> 01:01:18.409
okay.
If he's using Fact A,

01:01:18.409 --> 01:01:21.665
he should not shoot.
Alternatively,

01:01:21.665 --> 01:01:24.099
he could think that Chevy is
going to shoot tomorrow,

01:01:24.099 --> 01:01:26.579
in which case he uses Fact B,
and what does he do?

01:01:26.579 --> 01:01:30.427
He adds up his probability,
Patrick's probability of

01:01:30.427 --> 01:01:34.803
hitting today plus Chevy's
probability of hitting tomorrow:

01:01:34.803 --> 01:01:37.670
he asks is that sum bigger than
1,

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:43.734
and he concludes, no.
So we have no shot here and no

01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:47.595
shot here, and notice that both
of those arguments were

01:01:47.595 --> 01:01:50.148
dominance arguments.
In each case,

01:01:50.148 --> 01:01:53.780
whether Chevy thought that
Patrick was going to shoot

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:55.946
tomorrow or not,
in either case,

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:59.019
he concluded he should not
shoot today.

01:01:59.019 --> 01:02:01.416
When it was Patrick's turn,
whether Patrick thought that

01:02:01.416 --> 01:02:03.289
Chevy was going to shoot
tomorrow or not,

01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:05.407
in either case,
he concluded he should not

01:02:05.407 --> 01:02:07.630
shoot today.
So he takes a step forward.

01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:11.430
This argument continues,
it'll be Chevy's turn next,

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:15.530
and once again he'll look at
these two possibilities.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.117
If he thinks Patrick's not
shooting tomorrow,

01:02:17.117 --> 01:02:18.776
he wants to step,
if he thinks Patrick is going

01:02:18.776 --> 01:02:20.852
to shoot tomorrow,
he's again going to want to

01:02:20.852 --> 01:02:22.952
step the way it's drawn.
And, once again,

01:02:22.952 --> 01:02:25.335
we'll conclude step.
We'll go on doing this

01:02:25.335 --> 01:02:28.460
argument, and everyone see that
in each case this dominance

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:31.139
argument will apply.
It won't matter whether I think

01:02:31.139 --> 01:02:33.460
you should shoot tomorrow or
not, in either case,

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:36.000
it'll turn out that I should
step forward:

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.159
whether Fact A applies or
whether Fact B applies,

01:02:39.159 --> 01:02:41.981
So we'll go on going forward
and we'll have:

01:02:41.981 --> 01:02:44.409
no shot, no shot,
no shot, no shot,

01:02:44.409 --> 01:02:48.180
no shot, no shot,
and we'll arrive at d*.

01:02:54.889 --> 01:02:58.659
So it turns out that d* is
going to be Chevy's turn again.

01:02:58.659 --> 01:03:02.449
At d* we try exactly the same
reasoning.

01:03:02.449 --> 01:03:05.594
At d* he says,
if I think Patrick is not going

01:03:05.594 --> 01:03:08.179
to shoot tomorrow what should I
do?

01:03:08.179 --> 01:03:09.363
What should I do if I think
Patrick's not going to shoot

01:03:09.363 --> 01:03:10.116
tomorrow?
Student: Not shoot.

01:03:10.116 --> 01:03:11.019
Professor Ben Polak: Not
shoot.

01:03:11.019 --> 01:03:15.010
But now something different
occurs.

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:18.178
Now he says,
if I think Patrick is going to

01:03:18.178 --> 01:03:20.969
shoot tomorrow,
then when I look at my

01:03:20.969 --> 01:03:24.070
inequality up there,
my * inequality,

01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:28.587
and add up my probability of
hitting today--which is this

01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:32.378
line here--plus Patrick's
probability of hitting

01:03:32.378 --> 01:03:36.976
tomorrow--which is this line
here--suddenly he finds it is

01:03:36.976 --> 01:03:41.014
bigger than 1.
So now if Chevy thinks that

01:03:41.014 --> 01:03:46.050
Patrick is going to shoot
tomorrow, what should Chevy do?

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:48.944
He should shoot.
So up until this point,

01:03:48.944 --> 01:03:53.138
a dominance argument has told
us no one should shoot,

01:03:53.138 --> 01:03:56.623
but suddenly we have a dilemma.
The dilemma is:

01:03:56.623 --> 01:03:59.400
if Chevy thinks Patrick's not
shooting, he should step;

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.340
and if Chevy thinks Patrick is
shooting, he should shoot.

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.369
Everyone with me so far?
So what have we shown so far?

01:04:05.369 --> 01:04:09.183
We've shown that no one should
shoot until d* but we're stuck

01:04:09.183 --> 01:04:11.789
because we don't know what to do
at d*;

01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:14.369
because we don't know what
Chevy should believe at d*.

01:04:14.369 --> 01:04:17.742
We don't know whether Chevy
should believe that Patrick's

01:04:17.742 --> 01:04:21.355
going to shoot or whether Chevy
should believe that Patrick's

01:04:21.355 --> 01:04:25.100
not going to shoot.
So how do we figure out what

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:28.809
Chevy should believe Patrick's
going to do?

01:04:28.809 --> 01:04:32.916
Wait, wake up the guy in orange
there, the guy with the ginger

01:04:32.916 --> 01:04:36.972
hair, that's right.
What's the answer to that

01:04:36.972 --> 01:04:38.803
question?
Good, the answer to the

01:04:38.803 --> 01:04:42.460
question is backward induction.
Round of applause for

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:47.610
remembering the answer.
Good, backward induction is the

01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:51.371
answer to all questions,
especially when you're asleep

01:04:51.371 --> 01:04:53.729
right.
Okay, so now we're going to use

01:04:53.729 --> 01:04:56.058
backward induction,
but where does backward

01:04:56.058 --> 01:05:00.100
induction start here?
Backward induction starts at

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:05.135
the back of the game,
and what's the back of the game

01:05:05.135 --> 01:05:07.559
here?
The back of the game is where?

01:05:07.559 --> 01:05:10.333
It's when these two guys,
neither of them have thrown

01:05:10.333 --> 01:05:12.519
their sponge,
and they've reached here.

01:05:12.519 --> 01:05:15.500
So come here a second,
step, step.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.427
Let's assume it's Patrick's
turn, and they're absurdly

01:05:19.427 --> 01:05:22.170
close: they're uncomfortably
close.

01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:23.970
If they had longer noses they'd
be touching.

01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:28.887
They're at distance 0.
And at distance 0,

01:05:28.887 --> 01:05:33.579
at d = 0, let's suppose it's
Patrick's turn.

01:05:33.579 --> 01:05:35.003
So at d = 0,
no one has shot,

01:05:35.003 --> 01:05:37.037
it's Patrick's turn,
he's got the sponge,

01:05:37.037 --> 01:05:39.559
what should Patrick do?
Shout it out Patrick.

01:05:39.559 --> 01:05:41.154
Student: I should shoot.
Professor Ben Polak: You

01:05:41.154 --> 01:05:42.840
should shoot.
Patrick should shoot, right?

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:48.344
At d = 0, say it's 2's turn,
and the answer is he should

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:54.849
shoot because the probability of
it hitting at distance 0 is 1.

01:05:54.849 --> 01:05:57.183
Let's just move you to the side
a bit so that people can see the

01:05:57.183 --> 01:05:59.100
board.
I know it's an awkward dance

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.590
but here you are--stop there:
that's good.

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:06.949
So at distance 0 they should
certainly shoot.

01:06:06.949 --> 01:06:10.090
So now let's go back a step in
the backward induction.

01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:12.150
So we're at distance 1,
just take a step back.

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:19.888
So take a step back,
it's Chevy's turn at distance

01:06:19.888 --> 01:06:23.039
1.
And what does Chevy know at

01:06:23.039 --> 01:06:24.820
distance 1?
Chevy what do you know?

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.898
Shout it out.
Student: That Patrick

01:06:26.898 --> 01:06:29.331
will shoot next turn.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:06:29.331 --> 01:06:31.874
Right, so now Chevy knows that
Patrick's going to shoot

01:06:31.874 --> 01:06:34.523
tomorrow.
So which fact should Chevy use

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:37.510
in deciding whether he should
shoot today?

01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:41.633
B.
He should use Fact B,

01:06:41.633 --> 01:06:52.210
and that tells us--so 1 knows
that 2 will shoot tomorrow,

01:06:52.210 --> 01:07:00.877
so by B, 1 should shoot if his
probability of hitting at

01:07:00.877 --> 01:07:08.756
distance 1 plus Patrick's
probability of hitting at

01:07:08.756 --> 01:07:14.840
distance 0,
if that is bigger than 1.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.639
Well is it bigger than 1?
Well let's have a look.

01:07:17.639 --> 01:07:20.790
We had a shot in here already,
we put a shot in here,

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:22.849
and we're looking at distance
1.

01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:26.888
And so we're looking at this
distance here plus this distance

01:07:26.888 --> 01:07:29.490
here.
Is it bigger than 1?

01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:32.320
Yeah, it's bigger than 1.
Here's a bit more math.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.143
I lied to you before.
1 plus something is bigger than

01:07:35.143 --> 01:07:38.930
1.
So this is bigger than 1.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:44.284
So shoot.
Let's put it on our chart as

01:07:44.284 --> 01:07:45.674
shoot.
Let's go back a

01:07:45.674 --> 01:07:47.734
step--sorry--I'll have to have
Chevy do all the going

01:07:47.734 --> 01:07:49.590
backwards.
Now we're at distance what?

01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:53.768
We're at distance 2,
we're at d = 2,

01:07:53.768 --> 01:08:00.335
and it's Patrick's turn,
2's turn, and what does Patrick

01:08:00.335 --> 01:08:02.429
know?
Shout it out Patrick.

01:08:02.429 --> 01:08:04.253
Student: I know that
Chevy's going to shoot next

01:08:04.253 --> 01:08:05.985
turn.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:08:05.985 --> 01:08:08.811
Patrick knows that Chevy's going
to shoot next turn,

01:08:08.811 --> 01:08:11.360
so Patrick therefore should use
which fact?

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.330
Fact B.
And Fact B tells him that he

01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:17.289
should shoot--let's just put
this in.

01:08:17.289 --> 01:08:22.836
So 2 knows that 1 will shoot
tomorrow, so by B it's all the

01:08:22.836 --> 01:08:28.145
same thing.
We know that 2 should shoot if

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:29.771
P2[2]
+ P1[1]

01:08:29.771 --> 01:08:35.734
is bigger than 1,
and if we look at it on the

01:08:35.734 --> 01:08:41.020
board--here we are--it's 2's
turn,

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.536
he's looking at this distance
plus this distance,

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:46.820
and is it bigger than 1?
It is bigger than 1.

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:51.944
So he should shoot.
And we can go on doing this

01:08:51.944 --> 01:08:55.740
argument backwards.,
We'll find that Chevy should

01:08:55.740 --> 01:09:00.010
shoot here because this plus
this is bigger than 1.

01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:02.301
And we'll know that here
Patrick once again will know

01:09:02.301 --> 01:09:04.020
that Chevy's going to shoot
tomorrow,

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.805
so he should use Fact B,
so he should shoot provided

01:09:05.805 --> 01:09:07.380
this plus this is bigger than 1,
but it is.

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:10.795
Now, we're back at d* and the
question we had at d*-- the

01:09:10.795 --> 01:09:13.539
question we'd left hanging at
d*--was what?

01:09:13.539 --> 01:09:17.383
At d* we knew already that
Chevy would not shoot if he

01:09:17.383 --> 01:09:21.010
thought Patrick was not going to
shoot tomorrow,

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:23.192
but he should shoot if thinks
Patrick is going to shoot

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:24.930
tomorrow, but what does Chevy
know at d*?

01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:26.229
Student: I know Patrick
is going to shoot.

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:28.208
Professor Ben Polak: He
knows Patrick's going to shoot,

01:09:28.208 --> 01:09:30.720
so he should shoot.
Is that right?

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.820
He knows Patrick's going to
shoot by backward induction so

01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:35.710
he should shoot.
So we just solved this.

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:39.605
What did we actually show?
We showed, have seats

01:09:39.605 --> 01:09:45.837
gentlemen--sorry to keep you up
here--we know that prior to d*

01:09:45.837 --> 01:09:52.069
no one will shoot--will not
shoot--and we know that at d*,

01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:56.479
and in fact at any point
further on, we should shoot.

01:09:56.479 --> 01:09:58.680
That's horrible writing but it
says shoot.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:04.010
So we've shown more than we
claimed.

01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:05.516
We claimed that the first shot
should occur at d*,

01:10:05.516 --> 01:10:07.390
and we've actually shown more
than that: we've shown that even

01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:10.029
if you went beyond d*,
and if somebody had forgotten

01:10:10.029 --> 01:10:13.010
to shoot at d*,
at least you should shoot now.

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:14.665
Give me like two more minutes
or three more minutes to finish

01:10:14.665 --> 01:10:15.880
this up because we're at a high
point now.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.510
Everyone okay to wait a couple
of minutes?

01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:24.755
Okay, so what did we prove here?
We proved that the first shot

01:10:24.755 --> 01:10:30.489
occurs at d* whoever's turn it
is at d*.

01:10:30.489 --> 01:10:33.253
It wasn't that the best guy,
the better shot,

01:10:33.253 --> 01:10:36.331
should shoot first,
or the worse shot should shoot

01:10:36.331 --> 01:10:38.120
first.
It turned out that,

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.237
given their abilities,
there was a critical distance

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:44.278
at which they should shoot.
If you go back to the

01:10:44.278 --> 01:10:47.617
eighteenth century military
strategy, you should shoot when

01:10:47.617 --> 01:10:50.609
you see the whites of their
eyes, which is at d*.

01:10:50.609 --> 01:10:56.119
But we learned something else
on the way.

01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:59.167
I claimed we learned that if
you're patient and you go

01:10:59.167 --> 01:11:01.791
through things carefully,
that the arguments we've

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:04.201
learned from the course so far,
dominance arguments and

01:11:04.201 --> 01:11:08.063
backward induction arguments,
can solve out a really quite

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:11.220
hard problem.
This was hard.

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:13.817
It would have been useful for
the guy in War and Peace,

01:11:13.817 --> 01:11:16.560
or in Onegin or the guys
cycling in the Tour de France,

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.909
or you guys with your sponges
to know this.

01:11:17.909 --> 01:11:22.069
And we can solve this exactly
using backward induction,

01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:24.920
and everyone in the room can do
it.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:29.020
Let me just push the argument a
tiny bit further.

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:32.058
One thing we've always asked in
this class, is okay that's fine

01:11:32.058 --> 01:11:34.264
if everyone knows what's going
on in the game:

01:11:34.264 --> 01:11:37.057
here we have our smart Yale
football players and they know

01:11:37.057 --> 01:11:39.925
how to play this game,
so they're going to shoot at

01:11:39.925 --> 01:11:41.779
the right time.
But what happens if,

01:11:41.779 --> 01:11:44.430
instead of playing another
smart Yale football player,

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:47.529
they're playing some uneducated
probably simple-minded football

01:11:47.529 --> 01:11:51.750
player from,
say, Harvard.

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:55.361
Now that changes things a bit
doesn't it because we know that

01:11:55.361 --> 01:11:58.010
the Yale football player is
sophisticated,

01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:59.790
has taken my class,
and knows that he should shoot

01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:01.970
at d*, but the Harvard guy
doesn't learn anything anymore,

01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:05.787
so they're stuck.
So if you're the Yale guy

01:12:05.787 --> 01:12:09.789
playing the Harvard guy how does
that change your decision?

01:12:09.789 --> 01:12:14.127
Should you shoot earlier than
d* when you're playing against

01:12:14.127 --> 01:12:17.363
the Harvard guy,
or later than d* when you're

01:12:17.363 --> 01:12:21.334
playing against the Harvard guy?
Let's try our Yale guys and see

01:12:21.334 --> 01:12:23.130
what they think,
what do you think Chevy?

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:24.449
Student: Definitely not
earlier.

01:12:24.449 --> 01:12:25.968
Professor Ben Polak:
Definitely not earlier,

01:12:25.968 --> 01:12:27.189
that's the key thing right.
Now why?

01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:30.979
Why definitely not earlier?
Student: Because if you

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:34.880
miss, the other person has a
probability of 1,

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:38.260
you have a higher chance of
missing.

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:42.340
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so I claim Chevy's right.

01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:44.281
That's good because I've just
claimed that Yale football

01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:45.990
players are sophisticated.
Chevy's right,

01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:48.668
that even if you're playing
against a Harvard guy you

01:12:48.668 --> 01:12:51.398
shouldn't shoot before d*
because it was a dominant

01:12:51.398 --> 01:12:53.510
strategy not to shoot before
d*.

01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:56.378
It doesn't matter whether you
think the Harvard guy is going

01:12:56.378 --> 01:12:58.420
to be dumb enough to shoot early
or not.

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.520
If he is dumb enough to shoot
early, so much the better.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.577
You should wait until D*.
Notice that argument doesn't

01:13:03.577 --> 01:13:05.989
depend on you playing against
somebody who is sophisticated,

01:13:05.989 --> 01:13:08.583
or someone who's less
sophisticated,

01:13:08.583 --> 01:13:13.029
like a Harvard football player,
or somebody who's basically a

01:13:13.029 --> 01:13:16.420
chair,
like a Harvard football player.

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:19.455
You shouldn't shoot before d*
because it's a dominant strategy

01:13:19.455 --> 01:13:21.765
not to shoot before d*.
Now, you might want to wait a

01:13:21.765 --> 01:13:23.640
little to see if they're not
going to shoot early,

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.904
to see if he's not going to
shoot, but you certainly

01:13:25.904 --> 01:13:28.434
shouldn't shoot early.
Let me finish with one other

01:13:28.434 --> 01:13:31.029
thing.
Every time when we've played

01:13:31.029 --> 01:13:35.010
this game in class,
whether it's here or up in SOM,

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:40.010
people shoot too early.
They miss.

01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:42.392
You can do the econometrics on
this, you could figure out that,

01:13:42.392 --> 01:13:44.352
on average--average
abilities--I'm sometimes getting

01:13:44.352 --> 01:13:46.991
the better shots,
sometimes I'm getting the worse

01:13:46.991 --> 01:13:50.655
shots--on average I should see
people hitting about half of the

01:13:50.655 --> 01:13:53.891
time over a large sample.
But here I tend to see people

01:13:53.891 --> 01:13:56.290
miss, as we did today,
almost all the time.

01:13:56.290 --> 01:14:04.810
Why do we see so many misses?
So one problem may be that

01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:08.252
people are just overconfident.
They're overconfident on their

01:14:08.252 --> 01:14:10.842
ability to throw.
And there's a large literature

01:14:10.842 --> 01:14:13.760
in Economics about how people
tend to be overconfident.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.201
But there's another possible
explanation, and let me just

01:14:16.201 --> 01:14:18.250
push it past you as the last
thing for today.

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:21.661
I think Americans--I think this
doesn't go for the

01:14:21.661 --> 01:14:25.560
Brits--Americans have what I
call a "pro-active bias."

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.655
You guys are brought up since
you're in kindergarten--maybe

01:14:28.655 --> 01:14:31.430
before--and you're told you have
to be pro-active.

01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:33.840
You have "to make the world
come to you."

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.970
And my evidence for this is
based on sophisticated empirical

01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:42.270
work watching Sports Center.
So on Sports Center when they

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:45.760
interview these sweaty athletes
after the game,

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.933
the sweaty athletes say,
it's great I now control my own

01:14:49.933 --> 01:14:52.560
destiny.
Well, I'm a Brit.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.088
I think controlling my own
destiny sounds kind of scary to

01:14:55.088 --> 01:14:56.310
me;
it doesn't sound like a good

01:14:56.310 --> 01:15:00.350
thing at all.
In fact, if I wanted to control

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:05.489
my own destiny,
I wouldn't have got married.

01:15:05.489 --> 01:15:10.041
That's going to be edited off
the film, but the point I want

01:15:10.041 --> 01:15:12.829
to make is this.
Every time I play this game,

01:15:12.829 --> 01:15:15.479
when I ask people why they
shoot early I hear the same

01:15:15.479 --> 01:15:18.029
thing, and it's evidence to this
proactive bias.

01:15:18.029 --> 01:15:23.204
People say, well at least I
went down swinging and the

01:15:23.204 --> 01:15:28.476
problem is: the aim in life is
not to go down swinging,

01:15:28.476 --> 01:15:33.805
it's not to go down.
So one lesson to get from this

01:15:33.805 --> 01:15:38.779
lecture is, sometimes waiting is
a good strategy.

01:15:38.779 --> 01:15:41.000
Alright, and we'll come back to
it on Monday.

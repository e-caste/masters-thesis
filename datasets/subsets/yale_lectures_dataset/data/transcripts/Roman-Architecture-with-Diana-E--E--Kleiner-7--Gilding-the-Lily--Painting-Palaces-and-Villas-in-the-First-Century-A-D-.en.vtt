00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.910
Prof: Good morning
everyone.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.308
As you can see from today's
lecture title,

00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:12.364
we're going to be talking about
painting palaces and villas in

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:14.520
the first century A.D.
 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.963
But I could also call this
lecture a lecture on Third and

00:00:18.963 --> 00:00:21.820
Fourth Style Roman wall
painting,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.406
because we're going to continue
our conversation today about the

00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:30.120
four architectural styles of
Roman wall painting.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.014
In order to do that,
I just want to remind you of

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:38.380
what we talked about last time.
 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.940
We covered the First and Second
Styles of Roman wall painting,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.437
and you'll remember that what
they had in common is that they

00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:48.760
both tried to create an illusion
of what they weren't,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.110
in a sense.
 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.030
Think back to the First Style
of Roman wall painting,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.177
when the painters tried to
transform a rubble wall into a

00:00:59.177 --> 00:01:01.692
marble wall,
to create the illusion that it

00:01:01.692 --> 00:01:05.500
was indeed a marble wall,
rather than a rubble wall.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.849
And in the case of the Second
Style--

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:10.510
and I show you two examples
again of that here,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.580
the detail from the Villa of
Publius Fannius Sinistor,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.560
on the left-hand side of the
screen,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.659
now in the Metropolitan Museum
of Art,

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.893
and the House of Augustus,
the Room of the Masks in the

00:01:24.893 --> 00:01:28.754
House of Augustus,
on the Palatine Hill in Rome,

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:32.650
both examples of Second Style
Roman wall painting.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.530
And we saw in this instance
that the illusion was to create

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.010
the sense that you were looking
through a window,

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.827
to transform,
once again, the rubble wall

00:01:41.827 --> 00:01:44.595
into a window,
a window that showed what might

00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:47.614
lie outside the villa,
in the peristyle court,

00:01:47.614 --> 00:01:48.450
for example.
 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.116
Remember this one,
with the shrine or

00:01:51.116 --> 00:01:55.855
tholos that is surrounded
by blue sky and looks like it is

00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:59.190
located perhaps in a domestic
peristyle,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.763
and then over here this window
that opens onto a sacro-idyllic

00:02:04.763 --> 00:02:05.858
landscape.
 

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:10.175
We are being beckoned into that
sacro-idyllic landscape to

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:14.188
explore the sacred items within
it and even beyond.

00:02:14.188 --> 00:02:17.030
So opening up these walls
illusionistically,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.801
to create an illusion in both,
but in the case of the Second

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:24.020
Style,
to open the wall up

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.240
illusionistically as a panoramic
window.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.484
We also explored the fact that
in the Second Style the Roman

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:34.972
designers,
the Roman painters,

00:02:34.972 --> 00:02:38.337
seemed to have experimented
with one-point linear

00:02:38.337 --> 00:02:41.628
perspective,
this perspective in which all

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:45.370
points recede to a single point
in the distance,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.405
and that we see that use of
one-point perspective in the

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:53.440
Second Style wall paintings in
the Room of the Masks.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.401
We also talked about the
relationship between Second

00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:59.770
Style Roman wall painting and
theatrical architecture --

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.038
that they may have been looking
at actual theaters,

00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:05.599
possibly in wood,
possibly in other more

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.620
permanent materials that no
longer survive,

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.460
or they may have been creating
this,

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.270
in part, out of whole cloth.
 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.449
So this connection to the
theater,

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:19.077
and the one last point that I
want to remind you of is the

00:03:19.077 --> 00:03:22.000
fact that we also discussed
that,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.473
although there's an enormous
respect for earlier Greek

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:25.857
architecture,
not only in these painting but

00:03:25.857 --> 00:03:29.665
in the temples and in the cities
and in the sanctuaries that

00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:33.391
we've already explored,
and we see the Roman painters

00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:36.470
using those elements of Greek
architecture--

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.378
columns and pediments and the
like--

00:03:38.378 --> 00:03:41.601
in the Second Style,
we also see that they are

00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:43.818
beginning to break the rules.
 

00:03:43.818 --> 00:03:45.440
They have a respect for Greek
architecture,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.610
but they're also willing to
bend the rules,

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.377
an example being,
of course, their use of the

00:03:51.377 --> 00:03:54.901
triangular pediment here,
but they have broken that

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:59.128
triangular pediment apart to
reveal the tholos here.

00:03:59.128 --> 00:04:00.740
This is a very important
development,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.278
and we saw it already also in
the Sanctuary of Fortuna

00:04:04.278 --> 00:04:07.746
Primigenia at Palestrina,
where you'll remember the

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:11.578
column capitals in the ramp and
how they slanted those column

00:04:11.578 --> 00:04:15.091
capitals in a way that Greek
architects never would have

00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:15.729
done.
 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.449
We see that same sort of
breaking of the rules here.

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.163
It's extremely important
because it shows again that

00:04:21.163 --> 00:04:24.144
although they revered the past,
they were willing to look

00:04:24.144 --> 00:04:25.528
forward to the future.
 

00:04:25.528 --> 00:04:28.331
And we're going to see,
especially in the late first

00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:31.156
century A.D.,
into the second century A.D.,

00:04:31.156 --> 00:04:34.110
further exploration of that
kind of thing,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.740
and it's going to have a huge
impact on Roman architecture.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.738
In order to explore the Third
and Fourth Styles,

00:04:42.738 --> 00:04:46.502
I need to go to a couple of
other cities than the ones we've

00:04:46.502 --> 00:04:47.970
looked at thus far.
 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.170
I have the map here once again
that shows Campania.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.620
We are going to be looking at
the city of -- or a villa -- in

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.810
the town of Oplontis,
which you see here.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.949
We'll also be looking at an
important villa at Boscotrecase.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.413
And you can see the proximity
of those two to the sites we've

00:05:09.413 --> 00:05:12.966
already discussed--Pompeii,
Herculaneum,

00:05:12.966 --> 00:05:16.699
Boscoreale, and also Naples,
up here.

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:20.810
I want to look first at a
villa, or the paintings at a

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.439
villa, at Oplontis.
 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:28.017
This villa--and you see a plan
of it here--appears to have

00:05:28.017 --> 00:05:33.889
belonged to a woman by the name
of Poppaea--P-o-p-p-a-e-a.

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.569
Who was Poppaea?
 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.504
Poppaea was first the mistress
and then the wife of Rome's

00:05:40.504 --> 00:05:42.670
notorious emperor Nero.
 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.562
Initially it looked as if the
two were soul mates because she

00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:50.000
seemed to have as much of a mean
streak as he did,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.709
in that she encouraged him,
quite avidly,

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:57.649
to murder his mother,
to murder his first wife,

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:02.680
and even to murder the
philosopher Seneca.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.778
But despite the fact that they
seemed to have been soul mates,

00:06:05.778 --> 00:06:09.213
Nero turned against her,
and in fact when she announced

00:06:09.213 --> 00:06:13.230
to him that she was pregnant,
he kicked her in the stomach,

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.870
which caused her death.
 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.177
But after her death he took
advantage of her death and

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:20.923
divinized her,
made her a diva for his

00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:22.610
own political purposes.
 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.829
So a very interesting saga
here, between Nero and his wife

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:27.569
Poppaea.
 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.160
The reason that we think
Poppaea owned this villa,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.819
or lived in this villa at some
point--

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.529
and the villa dates,
we believe, to 20 to 10 B.C.--

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.939
the reason we believe that she
lived there is that there was an

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:46.819
amphora,
one of these terracotta pots,

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:51.303
that was found in the
excavation with the name of a

00:06:51.303 --> 00:06:53.913
freedman,
a freedman of Poppaea,

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:57.259
which suggests that she may
well have lived there.

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.336
The other interesting
observation that archaeologists

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:03.651
made when they excavated this
particular house is that it

00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:07.142
looked like it had been empty at
the time of the eruption of

00:07:07.142 --> 00:07:10.062
Vesuvius,
when it had been indeed covered

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:11.588
over with ash and lava.
 

00:07:11.588 --> 00:07:15.141
And they also found a lot of
tools lying around the house,

00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:18.817
which led to their belief that
the house was probably in the

00:07:18.817 --> 00:07:20.750
process of being renovated.
 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.915
It may have suffered damage in
the earthquake and was in the

00:07:24.915 --> 00:07:27.740
process of being renovated,
before reuse,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.000
at the time Vesuvius struck.
 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.045
If we look at this very good
plan of what is preserved of

00:07:34.045 --> 00:07:37.189
this villa today,
we can pick out a number of

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:40.586
features that we've already
become accustomed to in our

00:07:40.586 --> 00:07:42.851
study of Roman domestic
architecture:

00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:44.300
houses and villas.
 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.314
We can see peristyle courts
with columns,

00:07:47.314 --> 00:07:48.370
for example.
 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.970
We notice here the very large
atrium, with the

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.410
impluvium designated here
in plan.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.105
There was a kitchen,
an extensive kitchen,

00:07:58.105 --> 00:07:59.420
over here as well.
 

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.151
We also see the use of columns,
these colonnades that are part

00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:06.615
of peristyles,
in some cases,

00:08:06.615 --> 00:08:11.365
but also are colonnades that
look out from the villa toward

00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:15.161
what surrounds it --
the landscape and the sea and

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.879
so on,
that surround it.

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:20.026
And it's another example of
what we began to see in the

00:08:20.026 --> 00:08:23.291
second phase of the plan of the
Villa of the Mysteries in

00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:25.504
Pompeii,
and that is an opening up of

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:28.384
the facade,
an incorporation of a larger

00:08:28.384 --> 00:08:33.190
number of windows to make the
facade lighter and more airy,

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.754
as well as a series of
colonnades with spectacular

00:08:36.754 --> 00:08:39.808
views toward what lay outside
the villa.

00:08:39.808 --> 00:08:44.850
The most important room for us
today is Room Number 8,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:49.418
over here, and that room is
part of an interior bath,

00:08:49.418 --> 00:08:54.058
an elaborate interior bath,
that was part of this villa.

00:08:54.058 --> 00:08:56.307
And Room Number 8,
which is basically a

00:08:56.307 --> 00:08:59.014
rectangular room,
as you can see here,

00:08:59.014 --> 00:09:03.360
was the caldarium or the
warm room of that bath,

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.125
and it has some very
interesting paintings that will

00:09:07.125 --> 00:09:11.629
show us the transition between
what we know of as Second Style

00:09:11.629 --> 00:09:15.912
Roman wall painting and what we
term Third Style Roman wall

00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:17.019
painting.
 

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:19.658
This is a view of the villa as
it looks today.

00:09:19.658 --> 00:09:21.379
You can see,
like Herculaneum,

00:09:21.379 --> 00:09:24.876
it is very closely surrounded
by modern apartment houses and

00:09:24.876 --> 00:09:25.470
so on.
 

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.058
Here you see it.
 

00:09:27.058 --> 00:09:29.980
It's only again part of what
the original villa was.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.836
But even from this view,
you can get a sense of how open

00:09:32.836 --> 00:09:35.019
it was compared to those very
enclosed,

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:38.210
severe Domus Italica
houses that we began with.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:43.126
You see here this opening up,
views through columns and

00:09:43.126 --> 00:09:46.245
doorways,
but also these peristyle courts

00:09:46.245 --> 00:09:52.284
and colonnaded courts and so on,
that again give this a very

00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:56.971
open appearance,
which is part of again this

00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:01.100
important development toward
that kind of openness.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.927
The villa has in it both Second
and Third Style Roman wall

00:10:05.927 --> 00:10:08.467
paintings,
which again makes it extremely

00:10:08.467 --> 00:10:10.913
interesting,
because it is clear that there

00:10:10.913 --> 00:10:14.830
was some transitioning here,
from one style to the other.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.028
And I should mention,
by the way, that with regard to

00:10:18.028 --> 00:10:19.833
the First,
Second, Third,

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:23.065
and Fourth Styles,
they weren't necessarily an

00:10:23.065 --> 00:10:24.980
evolution,
a development,

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.163
from one point to another;
by that I mean I don't think

00:10:28.163 --> 00:10:30.908
the painters or the patrons
necessarily had in mind,

00:10:30.908 --> 00:10:34.076
"We're going to start at
Point A and get to Point D

00:10:34.076 --> 00:10:35.168
eventually."
 

00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:38.000
I think that what we're dealing
with here,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.379
as we talk about this
chronological evolution,

00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:45.029
is a transition of styles that
had something to do in part

00:10:45.029 --> 00:10:48.577
probably with fashion,
with fashion for a particular

00:10:48.577 --> 00:10:51.221
way of decorating things,
and, of course,

00:10:51.221 --> 00:10:54.217
with influences that were
coming in from other parts of

00:10:54.217 --> 00:10:54.940
the world.
 

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.129
And, in fact,
as far as the transition from

00:10:57.129 --> 00:11:01.336
the Second to the Third Style,
the cycle of styles seems to

00:11:01.336 --> 00:11:06.754
suggest that at the time that
the Second Style was at its most

00:11:06.754 --> 00:11:11.995
popular was just when those who
owned these houses wanted to

00:11:11.995 --> 00:11:15.850
move on to something new,
understandably.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.493
Once everybody had it,
it was time to think about

00:11:18.493 --> 00:11:19.428
something else.
 

00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:22.620
And so the cycle,
just as these walls that we've

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.678
been describing--
the Room of the Masks,

00:11:25.678 --> 00:11:28.861
the Fannius Sinistor,
and this one in Oplontis that

00:11:28.861 --> 00:11:30.928
we see on the left-hand side of
the screen--

00:11:30.928 --> 00:11:32.928
just as they gained their
greatest popularity,

00:11:32.928 --> 00:11:37.668
there was a decision to move on
to still another cycle of taste.

00:11:37.668 --> 00:11:41.158
And again, that's exactly what
we're going to see at Oplontis.

00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:44.022
I show you here on the
left--actually it's not on your

00:11:44.022 --> 00:11:47.210
Monument List but in order to
get us to the Third Style,

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.730
I want to say something about a
Second Style painting at

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.294
Oplontis,
and we see a detail of that on

00:11:53.294 --> 00:11:55.330
the left-hand side of the
screen.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.855
I compare it to the Second
Style, or a part of the Second

00:11:58.855 --> 00:12:02.129
Style wall of P. Fannius
Sinistor at Boscoreale.

00:12:02.129 --> 00:12:06.659
And I think you can see the
resemblance between the two.

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:08.288
The objectives are the same.
 

00:12:08.288 --> 00:12:11.740
The artist is trying to open up
the wall,

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.845
to create a picture window
through which you can see a

00:12:15.845 --> 00:12:18.855
vista --
a vista that includes a round

00:12:18.855 --> 00:12:20.710
shrine,
just as we saw here.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.000
So the same at Oplontis,
a round shrine,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.038
in this case with the windows
spread to see a cult statue

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:28.716
inside,
and that shrine,

00:12:28.716 --> 00:12:31.110
that circular shrine or
tholos,

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:35.212
surrounded by a peristyle,
the kind of peristyle that one

00:12:35.212 --> 00:12:39.682
might have seen inside one of
these Roman houses surrounding a

00:12:39.682 --> 00:12:40.490
garden.
 

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.774
Just as at Boscoreale,
we see the gateway that seems

00:12:44.774 --> 00:12:49.562
to separate us from what lies
beyond, and we see again the

00:12:49.562 --> 00:12:52.668
structure surrounded by blue
sky.

00:12:52.668 --> 00:12:55.942
We also see these very
substantial columns that are

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.428
characteristic of the Second
Style,

00:12:58.428 --> 00:13:01.210
projecting out into the
spectator's space,

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.306
supporting entablatures that
also project out into the

00:13:05.306 --> 00:13:09.591
spectator's space,
and supporting also a lintel

00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:14.892
that has a ceiling,
with coffers that recede into

00:13:14.892 --> 00:13:15.690
depth.
 

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.730
So what we see in Second Style
at Oplontis is very similar to

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.952
what we saw at Second Style,
at Boscoreale and also at

00:13:23.952 --> 00:13:28.730
Pompeii, at Cubiculum 16 of the
Villa of the Mysteries.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.580
But if we look at
Caldarium 8,

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.058
Room 8, the caldarium of
the bath,

00:13:35.058 --> 00:13:39.860
we see something that may look
superficially similar,

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.529
but is actually very,
very different,

00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:44.909
and I think you can pick out
those differences very quickly,

00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:46.990
just as I can.
 

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.230
What we're looking at here is a
view of three walls -- the most

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:55.061
important back wall here,
and then the walls to the right

00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:56.428
and to the left.
 

00:13:56.428 --> 00:13:59.821
And if you look carefully,
you will see that the

00:13:59.821 --> 00:14:03.139
coloration is similar:
the famous Pompeian red,

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:06.025
a nice maroon,
some black, some gold used

00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:06.820
here.
 

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.091
And again, a quick glance,
you see that there's a

00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:13.570
landscape of some sort,
with a blue sky right in the

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:14.320
center.
 

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.240
So you're--being used to Second
Style painting,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.558
you might say to yourself,
"Oh well,

00:14:18.558 --> 00:14:20.937
that's another window into
something that lies

00:14:20.937 --> 00:14:21.730
beyond."
 

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.152
But if we look at it very
carefully we will see that that

00:14:25.152 --> 00:14:26.678
is not the case at all.
 

00:14:26.678 --> 00:14:30.673
We're going to see here that
what has happened is that the

00:14:30.673 --> 00:14:34.457
artists have rejected the
perspectival panoramas of the

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:38.477
Second Style,
in favor of going back to an

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:42.419
appreciation of the flatness of
a wall.

00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:43.700
What is a wall but flat?
 

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.840
A wall is flat.
 

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.620
A flat wall is to be decorated.
 

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.494
So sort of believing in that
integrity of that wall is the

00:14:51.494 --> 00:14:56.710
cornerstone of the thinking for
what we call Third Style Roman

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.250
wall painting.
 

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.293
And you can see the way the
artist has treated the wall:

00:15:01.293 --> 00:15:04.649
a series of zones;
a painted maroon zone or a

00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:07.231
socle down here;
a middle tier,

00:15:07.231 --> 00:15:11.889
painted Pompeian red;
an upper tier painted this gold;

00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:16.244
all of which looks like a
series of stripes across the

00:15:16.244 --> 00:15:16.820
wall.
 

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.331
Let me show you another view,
which is a little bit brighter,

00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:22.788
so that I think you can see
this better;

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:25.221
the maroon zone,
the red zone,

00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:26.899
and the gold zone.
 

00:15:26.899 --> 00:15:32.200
And if you look also at the
painting in the center,

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.658
you will see that there are
some architectural elements,

00:15:35.658 --> 00:15:38.585
but they are not the
substantial architectural

00:15:38.585 --> 00:15:40.600
elements of the Second Style.
 

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.149
They are very attenuated.
 

00:15:43.149 --> 00:15:46.678
If you look at these--and I'll
show you a detail in a moment,

00:15:46.678 --> 00:15:48.854
they are, in fact,
columns, we'll see,

00:15:48.854 --> 00:15:50.558
with capitals at the top.
 

00:15:50.558 --> 00:15:53.509
But from a distance they don't
look like columns.

00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:58.279
They look like white stripes
against a flat wall.

00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:00.970
They support lintels,
as you can see here.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.100
These lintels don't
project--they're just straight

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.102
lintels,
they're not broken in any

00:16:05.102 --> 00:16:07.418
way--and they too are very
delicate,

00:16:07.418 --> 00:16:11.259
and from a distance look like a
stripe against the wall,

00:16:11.259 --> 00:16:13.210
not like a lintel.
 

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:17.547
We can also see--and I think
that having a detail will help

00:16:17.547 --> 00:16:18.370
you here.
 

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.355
Yes, let me first show you a
comparison between this wall in

00:16:22.355 --> 00:16:26.275
Caldarium 8 and the
Second Style wall that we looked

00:16:26.275 --> 00:16:27.558
at just before.
 

00:16:27.558 --> 00:16:30.739
And I think you can see very
clearly the differences here:

00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:32.970
the substantial columns in this
case,

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.317
the opening up of the wall as a
window to something that lies

00:16:36.317 --> 00:16:36.820
beyond.
 

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.360
This is very different.
 

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.570
Yes, there's a blue sky.
 

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.548
Yes, there's a tree.
 

00:16:40.548 --> 00:16:44.928
But that scene is contained
within a frame.

00:16:44.928 --> 00:16:48.168
I think I can also illustrate
that better here by showing you

00:16:48.168 --> 00:16:49.950
a detail of that central panel.
 

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.936
That central panel,
by the way, represents not

00:16:52.936 --> 00:16:56.851
something that one would be
likely to see outside the window

00:16:56.851 --> 00:16:59.974
of one's house,
but rather a mythological

00:16:59.974 --> 00:17:03.850
scene, which represents the
legendary hero Hercules--

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.898
you see him over
here--Hercules,

00:17:05.898 --> 00:17:09.865
and in fact Hercules has just
finished the last of his Twelve

00:17:09.865 --> 00:17:12.700
Labors,
and he has brought back the

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.051
Apples of the Hesperides,
which you see sitting on a rock

00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:19.810
over here,
and so he is celebrating the

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.180
last of these Twelve Labors.
 

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.920
For some reason he seems to be
kind of a tree hugger here;

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.194
he seems to be hugging the
tree, a tree that has a yellow

00:17:29.194 --> 00:17:30.598
ribbon tied around it.
 

00:17:30.598 --> 00:17:34.702
We use today yellow--we tie
yellow ribbons around things,

00:17:34.702 --> 00:17:37.558
for a variety of reasons,
as we know.

00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:40.468
We don't know exactly why the
Romans did that,

00:17:40.468 --> 00:17:43.828
but we see that frequently in
Roman wall painting.

00:17:43.828 --> 00:17:46.982
But here he is standing at the
base of the tree,

00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:49.867
his labors completed,
and that tree again is

00:17:49.867 --> 00:17:51.680
surrounded by blue sky.
 

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.948
But I think you can see that it
is not a window into something

00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:58.790
that lies beyond,
because the scene is contained

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.593
within this frame,
and what the artist has done is

00:18:02.593 --> 00:18:05.049
outlined the frame with a very
black,

00:18:05.049 --> 00:18:07.460
dark black outline.
 

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.951
Now whether this has anything
to do with those old curtains

00:18:09.951 --> 00:18:12.013
that we talked about in the
Second Style might be

00:18:12.013 --> 00:18:13.259
interesting to speculate.
 

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:17.251
But it looks to us like it's
basically just a frame that is

00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:19.798
making it clear that this is
flat,

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:24.250
that what we are dealing with
here is a flat wall,

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.910
onto which a panel picture has
been attached.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.548
It is hung -- it seems to be
hung on that flat wall;

00:18:31.548 --> 00:18:36.078
it is not meant as a window or
a panorama into something else.

00:18:36.078 --> 00:18:39.661
Besides the black frame,
you see there's also a molded

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:41.561
frame,
very nicely painted here,

00:18:41.561 --> 00:18:44.509
and in this detail you can see
that again what looked like

00:18:44.509 --> 00:18:47.047
stripes,
white stripes on a flat wall

00:18:47.047 --> 00:18:49.779
from a distance,
are indeed columns.

00:18:49.779 --> 00:18:53.804
You can see that they support
capitals and a lintel up above,

00:18:53.804 --> 00:18:57.358
but from a distance again they
don't look that way.

00:18:57.358 --> 00:19:01.093
And they are columns and
capitals very different from

00:19:01.093 --> 00:19:04.755
what we've seen before,
because again they are very,

00:19:04.755 --> 00:19:07.700
very, very attenuated,
very delicate.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.832
They don't have any of the
substance of the columns of the

00:19:11.832 --> 00:19:12.920
Second Style.
 

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.308
Look up above the panel picture
of Hercules and you'll see--

00:19:17.308 --> 00:19:19.278
and I have a better detail of
this in a moment--

00:19:19.278 --> 00:19:24.338
a series of figures that are
located in the yellow zone,

00:19:24.338 --> 00:19:27.900
and I can show them better to
you perhaps here,

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.519
where you're looking also at a
view of the socle.

00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:35.054
This side of the wall--you may
have noticed this in the general

00:19:35.054 --> 00:19:37.970
view--is actually a niche;
it's actually a niche,

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.710
a rectangular,
fairly shallow,

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.328
rectangular niche there.
 

00:19:41.328 --> 00:19:44.460
So the painting continues into
that niche, which gives it a

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.157
little sense of depth,
a little more sense of depth

00:19:47.157 --> 00:19:48.940
than it would have otherwise.
 

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:53.853
And above the niche is a
soffit, which you can see is

00:19:53.853 --> 00:19:58.009
also painted,
and I show you a detail of that

00:19:58.009 --> 00:19:59.900
soffit up above.
 

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.213
If you look at what's right
above the painting of Hercules,

00:20:03.213 --> 00:20:06.700
you will see--and I'll show you
these in detail in a moment--a

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.904
citharist;
that is, a man who plays a

00:20:08.904 --> 00:20:12.150
cithara, who is seated there and
is playing his instrument.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.950
On either side of him we see
panel pictures,

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.828
and then on top of those panel
pictures peacocks,

00:20:19.828 --> 00:20:22.913
peacocks that are represented
frontally and look out toward

00:20:22.913 --> 00:20:23.180
us.
 

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.038
And if you look at both--and
we'll look at them in detail

00:20:26.038 --> 00:20:28.213
again momentarily--
if you look at the citharist,

00:20:28.213 --> 00:20:29.509
and if you look at the
peacocks,

00:20:29.509 --> 00:20:32.108
you see that they are standing
on ground lines,

00:20:32.108 --> 00:20:35.009
but ground lines that don't
look like they have any depth;

00:20:35.009 --> 00:20:37.160
in fact, they're standing
somewhere where you couldn't

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.028
really stand,
which is one of the interesting

00:20:40.028 --> 00:20:43.682
features of Third Style,
again this desire to move and

00:20:43.682 --> 00:20:45.970
to respect the flatness of the
wall.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.397
If we look at the soffit,
we see that that too is painted

00:20:49.397 --> 00:20:52.593
in red and gold;
that it is divided into a

00:20:52.593 --> 00:20:55.751
series of panels;
that in those panels we see

00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:59.363
floating, mythological figures,
a woman on a bull--I'll show

00:20:59.363 --> 00:21:02.545
you a detail of her in a
moment--just floating in the

00:21:02.545 --> 00:21:03.278
center.
 

00:21:03.278 --> 00:21:05.536
She doesn't seem to be in any
space at all,

00:21:05.536 --> 00:21:07.038
she's just floating there.
 

00:21:07.038 --> 00:21:09.720
And then on either side a niche
with a shell at the top,

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.692
with standing figures,
and then strangely enough

00:21:12.692 --> 00:21:14.970
pictures of still-life
paintings,

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.059
right below those.
 

00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:19.900
Here are all of those details.
 

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.175
Here we see the citharist,
sitting again where there

00:21:23.175 --> 00:21:26.219
doesn't seem to be--
there is a maroon,

00:21:26.219 --> 00:21:30.413
a brown line here,
but it doesn't look like it

00:21:30.413 --> 00:21:32.180
occupies any space.
 

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.815
So there's this interesting
tension between the flatness of

00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:37.359
the wall and the fact that
there's a figure that seems to

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:39.859
be sitting somewhere where
there's no place to sit.

00:21:39.859 --> 00:21:41.308
The same with the peacocks.
 

00:21:41.308 --> 00:21:44.201
You can see them,
this one standing on this

00:21:44.201 --> 00:21:45.509
white, flat line.
 

00:21:45.509 --> 00:21:51.009
His toes do seem to be
projecting a bit over those.

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:55.560
So there's this interesting
tension between what's flat and

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.230
what might have a hint of space.
 

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.088
And then below that,
one of these sacro-idyllic

00:22:01.088 --> 00:22:03.663
landscapes,
again framed in black,

00:22:03.663 --> 00:22:08.157
making it clear that we are to
read this as a panel picture

00:22:08.157 --> 00:22:11.806
hanging on a flat wall,
a kind of picture gallery,

00:22:11.806 --> 00:22:14.798
in a way that's very different
from Second Style.

00:22:14.798 --> 00:22:19.130
Up here, a mysterious figure
with a sacrificial dish,

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:23.292
standing in a niche,
with a shell decoration at the

00:22:23.292 --> 00:22:23.960
top.
 

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.990
And then a still-life painting
with fruit down below.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.859
And then up here,
something that we're going to

00:22:30.859 --> 00:22:34.416
see becomes ubiquitous in Third
Style Roman wall painting:

00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:38.098
a figure that floats in the
center of a colored panel,

00:22:38.098 --> 00:22:43.101
either red or black or white,
in this case a mostly nude

00:22:43.101 --> 00:22:46.945
female figure who is riding,
as you can see,

00:22:46.945 --> 00:22:48.519
on the back of a bull.
 

00:22:48.519 --> 00:22:51.154
At least the front of the
animal is a bull,

00:22:51.154 --> 00:22:54.670
and you can see the back of the
animal has a fishtail.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:23:00.538
So it's a kind of bull-like sea
creature, as you can see here.

00:23:00.538 --> 00:23:03.240
So this room,
this very important room,

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.000
Caldarium 8 in the Villa
at Oplontis,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.625
seems to be a good example of
this transition from Second

00:23:10.625 --> 00:23:14.295
Style,
which was also in the house,

00:23:14.295 --> 00:23:19.308
to some new cycle of fashion in
Roman painting.

00:23:19.308 --> 00:23:26.519
An example of the mature Third
Style can be seen in two rooms,

00:23:26.519 --> 00:23:29.815
the Red Room and the Black
Room, so called for obvious

00:23:29.815 --> 00:23:33.194
reasons--
this is the Red Room--that

00:23:33.194 --> 00:23:39.210
belong to the Villa of Agrippa
Postumus at Boscotrecase,

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.798
that dates to around 11 B.C.,
we believe.

00:23:42.798 --> 00:23:48.548
This house we think also had
Imperial connections;

00:23:48.548 --> 00:23:52.477
that is, we think that this
house was put up in honor of the

00:23:52.477 --> 00:23:55.338
first emperor of Rome,
Augustus' only child,

00:23:55.338 --> 00:23:56.868
his daughter Julia.
 

00:23:56.868 --> 00:24:01.970
The marriage of Julia to
Tiberius--t-i-b-e-r-i-u-s,

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.798
the man who was to become the
second emperor of Rome--

00:24:04.798 --> 00:24:09.172
the marriage of Julia to
Tiberius may have been the

00:24:09.172 --> 00:24:13.019
occasion for the decoration of
this house.

00:24:13.019 --> 00:24:16.530
It bears the name of one of
Julia's sons by a different man,

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:19.088
by Marcus Agrippa,
her son, her last son;

00:24:19.088 --> 00:24:22.548
his name was Agrippa Postumus,
because he was born after--

00:24:22.548 --> 00:24:25.372
she was impregnated,
obviously, by Agrippa before he

00:24:25.372 --> 00:24:27.903
died --
but the child was actually born

00:24:27.903 --> 00:24:29.740
after the death of Agrippa.
 

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.670
Hence his name Agrippa Postumus.
 

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.695
There's some speculation that
he may have lived in this villa

00:24:35.695 --> 00:24:36.769
at some point.
 

00:24:36.769 --> 00:24:40.828
But what's important to us is
the likelihood seems to be that,

00:24:40.828 --> 00:24:42.529
just as with the Villa at
Oplontis,

00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:46.634
this villa seems to have been
owned by someone in the imperial

00:24:46.634 --> 00:24:47.240
family.
 

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.067
Which is very important because
it suggests to us not only that

00:24:51.067 --> 00:24:55.078
the finest artists of the day
must have been working on these,

00:24:55.078 --> 00:24:58.529
as they did in Rome for the
House of Augustus,

00:24:58.529 --> 00:25:01.259
or in Primaporta for the Villa
of Livia,

00:25:01.259 --> 00:25:04.615
but also leads me,
at least, to speculate that

00:25:04.615 --> 00:25:08.494
it's possible that these
interesting transitions from

00:25:08.494 --> 00:25:12.539
Second to Third Style,
and Third Style to Fourth

00:25:12.539 --> 00:25:17.170
Style, may have come at the
behest of the artists who were

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:22.125
these very high-level artists
who were working in the imperial

00:25:22.125 --> 00:25:23.098
employ.
 

00:25:23.098 --> 00:25:24.901
It makes a certain amount of
sense to speculate that that

00:25:24.901 --> 00:25:25.769
might have been the case.
 

00:25:25.769 --> 00:25:31.542
So here we have the Red Room of
the Villa of Agrippa Postumus at

00:25:31.542 --> 00:25:35.201
Boscotrecase,
and we can see some of the same

00:25:35.201 --> 00:25:39.019
features that we saw in
Caldarium 8 of the Villa

00:25:39.019 --> 00:25:40.078
at Oplontis.
 

00:25:40.078 --> 00:25:42.643
We see once again that those
substantial columns or that

00:25:42.643 --> 00:25:44.880
opening in the wall is gone,
forever banished;

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.169
in fact, the Romans never
return to their quest after

00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:50.509
one-point perspective,
for example.

00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:54.306
Respect for the integrity of
the wall, the flatness of the

00:25:54.306 --> 00:25:57.368
wall, the wall as a surface to
be decorated.

00:25:57.368 --> 00:26:02.295
We see that they have decorated
it with a system of tiers:

00:26:02.295 --> 00:26:06.788
a black socle at the bottom,
then a red central zone,

00:26:06.788 --> 00:26:08.950
and a red upper zone.
 

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:12.163
And, by the way,
we can still get some sense

00:26:12.163 --> 00:26:16.950
that they have looked at earlier
Second Style wall paintings,

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.519
because if you look at the
structure,

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:20.910
the overall structure of this
wall,

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.993
for example,
there still seems to be a

00:26:22.993 --> 00:26:26.357
central panel flanked by wings,
this whole idea of regia

00:26:26.357 --> 00:26:28.460
and hospitalia that we
talked about,

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.000
that goes back to theater
design.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.948
There's certainly a hint of
that still here in the general

00:26:34.948 --> 00:26:37.720
arrangement or formatting of the
wall.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.940
But it is completely flat:
black zone, red zone.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.307
And then, although we will see
in detail that we have a column

00:26:44.307 --> 00:26:46.491
here,
with a capital at the top,

00:26:46.491 --> 00:26:50.445
from a distance again it looks
like a white stripe on a flat

00:26:50.445 --> 00:26:53.912
wall,
and that's deliberate on the

00:26:53.912 --> 00:26:56.058
part of the artists.
 

00:26:56.058 --> 00:26:59.113
Again here, there's a panel in
the center, but it is not a

00:26:59.113 --> 00:27:01.900
panel that serves as a window to
what lies beyond.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.436
It is a panel that is meant to
be just that,

00:27:05.436 --> 00:27:06.259
a panel.
 

00:27:06.259 --> 00:27:10.656
It's meant to imitate perhaps a
marble painted panel that

00:27:10.656 --> 00:27:15.838
would've actually hung on a wall
in a house or villa like this,

00:27:15.838 --> 00:27:18.519
but depicting that here in
paint.

00:27:18.519 --> 00:27:23.403
So it is meant to be--we are
meant to see it as -- a panel

00:27:23.403 --> 00:27:27.772
picture that hangs on a flat
wall in the Red Room at

00:27:27.772 --> 00:27:29.230
Boscotrecase.
 

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:32.573
We can see also some vegetal
decoration--very,

00:27:32.573 --> 00:27:35.321
very delicate,
doesn't occupy space at

00:27:35.321 --> 00:27:38.220
all--decorates the flat wall
above.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:45.068
So very similar to what we saw
again in Caldarium 8.

00:27:45.068 --> 00:27:46.914
Here's a detail of the Red Room
where we can see the

00:27:46.914 --> 00:27:48.108
sacro-idyllic landscape better.
 

00:27:48.108 --> 00:27:51.599
You can see that it follows in
the line of other sacro-idyllic

00:27:51.599 --> 00:27:53.259
landscapes that we've seen.
 

00:27:53.259 --> 00:27:56.925
It has a shrine,
in this case a column that

00:27:56.925 --> 00:28:00.680
supports an urn,
at the top, with a tree;

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:07.009
behind that some sort of wall
with windows over here;

00:28:07.009 --> 00:28:12.459
and in this case a group of
shepherds with their flocks and

00:28:12.459 --> 00:28:17.532
other figures possibly involved
in some kind of ritual,

00:28:17.532 --> 00:28:21.009
located in and around the
shrine.

00:28:21.009 --> 00:28:23.837
You can also see here extremely
well in detail the way in which

00:28:23.837 --> 00:28:26.210
they have outlined this panel
with a black frame,

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:30.009
to make it very clear that this
is contained within a frame.

00:28:30.009 --> 00:28:33.578
Beyond that,
you can now see that this is a

00:28:33.578 --> 00:28:35.607
column,
a very attenuated,

00:28:35.607 --> 00:28:38.902
very delicate column --
more a colonnette we might call

00:28:38.902 --> 00:28:41.578
it,
with a capital at the top.

00:28:41.578 --> 00:28:47.180
But it is meant here not to
occupy any real space,

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.108
not to project into the
viewer's space,

00:28:50.108 --> 00:28:54.724
but to serve as a second frame
for the panel picture that is

00:28:54.724 --> 00:28:56.759
placed on the flat wall.
 

00:28:56.759 --> 00:29:00.192
I think it's instructive to
compare this to what we saw in

00:29:00.192 --> 00:29:02.601
the Room of the Masks,
House of Augustus,

00:29:02.601 --> 00:29:04.950
Palatine Hill,
Mature Second Style.

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:08.542
So Mature Second Style,
commissioned by an imperial

00:29:08.542 --> 00:29:10.689
patron;
Mature Third Style,

00:29:10.689 --> 00:29:14.400
commissioned by,
we think, an imperial patron.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.028
Both sacro-idyllic landscapes,
with white backgrounds,

00:29:18.028 --> 00:29:20.650
but you can see the main
difference here,

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.440
not only the substantial
architecture,

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.673
but the fact that the white
background continues behind the

00:29:26.673 --> 00:29:27.769
architecture.
 

00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:28.230
Right?
 

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.618
It continues behind the
architecture here,

00:29:31.618 --> 00:29:34.694
here, here, which gives us the
sense again that this is

00:29:34.694 --> 00:29:37.598
something that's a misty
landscape of some sort,

00:29:37.598 --> 00:29:40.558
that one could,
at least with one's eye,

00:29:40.558 --> 00:29:44.795
but also perhaps oneself,
could actually enter into and

00:29:44.795 --> 00:29:47.490
wander around;
that's the sense you get here.

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:49.710
But here you are stopped from
doing that.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:53.952
There's nothing more here than
a panel picture that hangs on a

00:29:53.952 --> 00:29:54.440
wall.
 

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:59.386
Now you might say to me that if
we're going back to respecting

00:29:59.386 --> 00:30:04.009
the wall and to having a
painting that is fairly flat,

00:30:04.009 --> 00:30:08.234
that what--are we going back to
the First Style of Roman wall

00:30:08.234 --> 00:30:09.009
painting?
 

00:30:09.009 --> 00:30:10.890
And I remind you of one of the
First Style Roman wall paintings

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:11.769
that we looked at together.
 

00:30:11.769 --> 00:30:14.374
But it really is very different
from the First Style as well,

00:30:14.374 --> 00:30:16.240
because in the First Style,
you'll remember,

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.759
the wall was not actually flat.
 

00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:20.078
The wall was built up as a
relief,

00:30:20.078 --> 00:30:22.778
in a series of architectural
zones,

00:30:22.778 --> 00:30:28.028
and then the individual blocks
were painted different colors,

00:30:28.028 --> 00:30:31.519
to give an illusion,
once again, that this was not a

00:30:31.519 --> 00:30:35.285
plain wall but rather a very
exotic and expensive marble

00:30:35.285 --> 00:30:37.800
wall,
with marbles brought from all

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.759
over the world to decorate it.
 

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:42.098
So an illusion of something
that it wasn't.

00:30:42.098 --> 00:30:46.067
Here in the Third Style we are
again not dealing with any

00:30:46.067 --> 00:30:49.248
illusions really at all,
but just a respect for the

00:30:49.248 --> 00:30:52.452
flatness of the wall,
decorating that flat wall with

00:30:52.452 --> 00:30:55.074
a kind of wallpaper,
through paint,

00:30:55.074 --> 00:30:59.608
and then putting on that flat
wallpapered wall pictures,

00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:03.974
hanging pictures,
just as we hang pictures on

00:31:03.974 --> 00:31:05.858
flat walls today.
 

00:31:05.858 --> 00:31:09.743
The Villa at Boscotrecase also
has a Black Room,

00:31:09.743 --> 00:31:14.538
so called because the main
color there, the main background

00:31:14.538 --> 00:31:17.018
color there is,
as you can see,

00:31:17.018 --> 00:31:18.009
black.
 

00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:20.690
It too is
interesting--interesting in a

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:24.852
somewhat different way -- but is
a quintessential example of

00:31:24.852 --> 00:31:28.519
mature Third Style Roman
architectural painting.

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:33.113
We see, once again,
that the room has been divided

00:31:33.113 --> 00:31:36.863
into a center,
a central area with wings,

00:31:36.863 --> 00:31:39.019
one on either side.
 

00:31:39.019 --> 00:31:42.827
We also see that it has been
divided into painted zones:

00:31:42.827 --> 00:31:45.459
red at the bottom,
black in the center,

00:31:45.459 --> 00:31:47.259
black also at the top.
 

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:50.394
We can see that there are
architectural members,

00:31:50.394 --> 00:31:53.127
although again they look,
from a distance,

00:31:53.127 --> 00:31:55.730
like white stripes on a black
wall.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.460
But if we get up close to
them--and I'll show you even

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:02.357
some closer views in a moment--
we will see that we are dealing

00:32:02.357 --> 00:32:04.777
with very,
very, very, very attenuated

00:32:04.777 --> 00:32:07.368
colonnettes,
with capitals at the top.

00:32:07.368 --> 00:32:09.509
And notice--and this has been
true throughout--

00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:12.910
they decorate these columns
also, all up and down,

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.941
all along the way,
with floral motifs and so on

00:32:15.941 --> 00:32:18.862
and so forth;
which also underscores their

00:32:18.862 --> 00:32:23.140
function as a decorative motif,
rather than an actual column.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.778
The column supports,
the colonnettes support what

00:32:27.778 --> 00:32:31.259
looks like a very simple
pediment.

00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:35.009
It's just slightly peaked,
as you can see up there.

00:32:35.009 --> 00:32:39.920
But there is one--this painting
is interesting because if you

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.978
look carefully at the frieze,
at the uppermost part of the

00:32:44.978 --> 00:32:46.731
columns,
or colonnettes,

00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:49.848
you will see that there is some
hint of space there.

00:32:49.848 --> 00:32:54.557
Look at the way it undulates
there: it recedes over here,

00:32:54.557 --> 00:32:58.508
recedes over there,
and then it also meanders in

00:32:58.508 --> 00:32:59.769
the center.
 

00:32:59.769 --> 00:33:02.858
So there's a slight hint,
in this particular case,

00:33:02.858 --> 00:33:06.690
of some space,
some recession into depth,

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:10.845
which only adds to the intrigue
and mystery of these incredible

00:33:10.845 --> 00:33:11.650
paintings.
 

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:14.308
These are very,
very interesting in detail.

00:33:14.308 --> 00:33:17.008
I can show you here,
for example,

00:33:17.008 --> 00:33:18.019
the swans.
 

00:33:18.019 --> 00:33:21.318
We see some swans--and remember
these swans.

00:33:21.318 --> 00:33:23.670
This again seems to be an
imperial house,

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.794
because we will see swans are
very important for the emperor

00:33:26.794 --> 00:33:29.146
Augustus,
and he decorates the Ara Pacis

00:33:29.146 --> 00:33:32.450
in Rome,
a great work of architecture

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.186
and sculpture,
with swans, that may make

00:33:35.186 --> 00:33:37.730
reference to a new Golden Age
that he has ushered in.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.380
We see those here.
 

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.375
But look at them,
look at the way they rest on

00:33:42.375 --> 00:33:45.038
these little candelabra-like
torches,

00:33:45.038 --> 00:33:50.650
and then those in turn on a
spiraling acanthus tendril,

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:54.048
that doesn't look like it could
support anything at all.

00:33:54.048 --> 00:33:58.934
How very strange,
to have a swan supported by a

00:33:58.934 --> 00:34:01.058
tendril like this.
 

00:34:01.058 --> 00:34:03.031
This sort of thing couldn't
actually work,

00:34:03.031 --> 00:34:05.532
and it's one of again the
intrigues of the details of

00:34:05.532 --> 00:34:06.880
paintings such as these.
 

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.730
This is another interesting
detail,

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:12.119
because it shows again a kind
of candelabrum supporting a

00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:15.702
panel picture,
that we are meant to read as a

00:34:15.702 --> 00:34:18.000
panel picture on the wall.
 

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.068
And if you look carefully,
you can see the Egyptianizing

00:34:21.068 --> 00:34:22.800
motifs in that panel picture.
 

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:27.648
There was an extreme
Egyptomania that spread through

00:34:27.648 --> 00:34:33.351
Rome and Italy after Augustus
was victorious over Mark Antony

00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:38.010
and Cleopatra at the famous
Battle of Actium.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:42.983
Augustus initially used these
Egyptianizing motifs to make

00:34:42.983 --> 00:34:47.610
political remarks about his
victory over Cleopatra and

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:48.570
Antony.
 

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:51.489
But over time it became more a
fashion,

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:56.000
and we begin to see
Egyptianizing motifs,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.389
not only in the homes of
members of the imperial family,

00:34:58.389 --> 00:35:02.920
but even used ever more widely
than that.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.653
Another detail shows again that
central area with the--now you

00:35:07.653 --> 00:35:12.077
can see that they are indeed
colonnettes, with capitals at

00:35:12.077 --> 00:35:13.010
the top.
 

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:15.132
You can also see there are a
couple of medallions,

00:35:15.132 --> 00:35:17.472
that turn out to be medallions
that have heads in them,

00:35:17.472 --> 00:35:18.079
over here.
 

00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:19.949
But here you can see how
fanciful it gets;

00:35:19.949 --> 00:35:23.929
even though this is clearly a
colonnette with a capital.

00:35:23.929 --> 00:35:27.150
What capital supports then,
in usual building practice,

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:30.250
supports on top of it a
medallion with a head,

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:34.010
and then another curlicue on
top of that,

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.204
and that supports the
pediments, and that has on the

00:35:36.204 --> 00:35:38.860
edge this very decorative motif,
dripping off the side?

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:44.010
There's no--this is fantastic
in that regard;

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:47.818
fantastic, and they're clearly
having fun with these details

00:35:47.818 --> 00:35:51.755
and with using these wonderful
details -- this dropped element

00:35:51.755 --> 00:35:53.500
over here, for example.
 

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.639
The images are interesting;
the heads are interesting.

00:35:57.639 --> 00:36:00.916
Many scholars have believed
that they're representations of

00:36:00.916 --> 00:36:02.081
gods,
like Apollo,

00:36:02.081 --> 00:36:05.230
but a couple of scholars have
put forward the idea,

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.780
and I find it a very attractive
one,

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.340
that we may actually
have--there are two of them--

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.349
we may actually have a portrait
of Julia,

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:14.900
whose marriage may have been
commemorated here,

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:21.920
and of her step-mother Livia,
the empress of Rome,

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.130
during the age of Augustus.
 

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:29.994
Most interesting of all is the
small sacro-idyllic landscape

00:36:29.994 --> 00:36:34.070
that floats in the center of the
panel.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.684
Again in Third Style Roman wall
painting we either tend to have

00:36:36.684 --> 00:36:38.539
painted panels in the center
with frames,

00:36:38.539 --> 00:36:42.123
as we've seen thus far,
or floating elements in the

00:36:42.123 --> 00:36:42.768
center.
 

00:36:42.768 --> 00:36:47.311
They could be a floating woman
on the back of a bull/sea

00:36:47.311 --> 00:36:51.440
creature, or they can be a
sacro-idyllic landscape,

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.010
as we see here.
 

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.530
And here's another detail where
we can blow up that

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.606
sacro-idyllic landscape and see
again that it is just the sort

00:36:58.606 --> 00:37:01.380
of sacred and idyllic landscape
we've seen before,

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.289
with a shrine;
the top of a column;

00:37:03.289 --> 00:37:06.641
a building over here;
trees, a tree in the center,

00:37:06.641 --> 00:37:10.204
other trees;
and then various sacrificial

00:37:10.204 --> 00:37:13.000
goings on in front of that.
 

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.552
But from a distance again it
just looks like some sort of

00:37:16.552 --> 00:37:19.659
object floating in the center of
a very large,

00:37:19.659 --> 00:37:25.438
black, flat wall:
one decorative motif among

00:37:25.438 --> 00:37:26.380
many.
 

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:32.282
We looked last time at the
magnificent paintings in the

00:37:32.282 --> 00:37:37.418
Villa of Livia at Primaporta,
and we talked about the fact

00:37:37.418 --> 00:37:40.518
that that was the quintessential
Second Style wall,

00:37:40.518 --> 00:37:44.496
because more than any other we
saw it was truly the wall as

00:37:44.496 --> 00:37:47.670
panorama,
as a vista into something that

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:51.487
might lie beyond,
and we described in great

00:37:51.487 --> 00:37:56.050
detail the features of this
particular painting.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:59.208
It's interesting that you
wouldn't think that a

00:37:59.208 --> 00:38:03.054
gardenscape would be a good
subject for Third Style Roman

00:38:03.054 --> 00:38:06.592
wall painting,
a kind of painting that again

00:38:06.592 --> 00:38:11.280
respects the flatness of a wall,
and yet we do have examples of

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.940
what we would term Third Style
Roman wall painting,

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:19.809
showing the depiction of a
gardenscape.

00:38:19.809 --> 00:38:21.018
And I turn to that now.
 

00:38:21.018 --> 00:38:24.974
The painting that you look at
is on the wall of the House of

00:38:24.974 --> 00:38:28.068
the Orchard,
the Casa del Frutteto,

00:38:28.068 --> 00:38:32.719
in Pompeii, in the so-called
Orchard Cubiculum,

00:38:32.719 --> 00:38:34.873
and it dates to A.D.
 

00:38:34.873 --> 00:38:35.951
25 to A.D.
 

00:38:35.951 --> 00:38:40.000
50;
so considerably later.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.164
And it's interesting,
by the way, to note the

00:38:42.164 --> 00:38:43.050
chronology here.
 

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:45.878
Third Style Roman wall painting
has a quite long life,

00:38:45.878 --> 00:38:48.922
because if we talk about it
being used already in 20 to 10

00:38:48.922 --> 00:38:49.349
B.C.
 

00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:51.340
at Oplontis,
and we're now looking at a

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.280
house that could be as late as
50,

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.500
might've been decorated as late
as 50 A.D.,

00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:03.050
that takes us sixty or seventy
years for this one style.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:05.208
So although I said these are
cycles of fashion,

00:39:05.208 --> 00:39:07.929
fashion wasn't changing all
that quickly at this particular

00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:08.539
juncture.
 

00:39:08.539 --> 00:39:13.817
But here we see a gardenscape
in what we would call a Third

00:39:13.817 --> 00:39:15.000
Style wall.
 

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.860
Now why do we call this a Third
Style wall?

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.920
It's divided into zones.
 

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.619
We have a black socle down here.
 

00:39:21.619 --> 00:39:25.534
We have a zone here,
which seems to show a fence,

00:39:25.534 --> 00:39:30.184
a more substantial fence than
we saw in the gardenscape of

00:39:30.184 --> 00:39:31.000
Livia.
 

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.550
It does seem to support some
marble vessels or vases here.

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:38.822
So you might--to look at the
bottom you think,

00:39:38.822 --> 00:39:39.480
"Well.
 

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.199
maybe there is some suggestion
of some space."

00:39:42.199 --> 00:39:48.101
In fact, if you look very
carefully at the gateway of the

00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:50.327
fence,
you can see that there is some

00:39:50.327 --> 00:39:52.630
attempt to represent it as if it
recedes into depth,

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.018
at least the doorway.
 

00:39:54.018 --> 00:39:58.000
So there's some attempt at that
here.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.101
But if you look at this zone,
I think you'll agree with me

00:40:01.101 --> 00:40:03.059
that the artists have once
again,

00:40:03.059 --> 00:40:05.264
the painters have once again,
respected the flatness of the

00:40:05.264 --> 00:40:05.530
wall.
 

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:10.179
Yes, there are columns here,
but they are not substantial

00:40:10.179 --> 00:40:11.010
columns.
 

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.619
They are attenuated columns,
maybe not as attenuated as

00:40:13.619 --> 00:40:15.699
Boscotrecase,
but attenuated nonetheless.

00:40:15.699 --> 00:40:19.010
They do have capitals at the
top.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:21.992
But as you walk into this room
and look at them from a

00:40:21.992 --> 00:40:25.369
distance, they look like gold
stripes on a flat back wall.

00:40:25.369 --> 00:40:28.123
And, in fact,
the fact that the wall was

00:40:28.123 --> 00:40:31.443
painted black is very
significant, and not blue,

00:40:31.443 --> 00:40:35.400
as we saw in the gardenscape of
Livia at Primaporta.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.226
And look also--what's
particularly interesting is the

00:40:39.226 --> 00:40:43.496
way in which the artist has
positioned the trees within the

00:40:43.496 --> 00:40:45.409
frames of the columns.
 

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:48.862
If you look very closely you
will see that there isn't a

00:40:48.862 --> 00:40:52.815
single leaf that either overlaps
the columns, or that disappears

00:40:52.815 --> 00:40:54.260
behind the columns.
 

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:57.920
They are completely contained
within those columns.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:01.380
They are represented very
abstractly, very flat.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:07.050
And so, because they are
contained within those,

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.818
we get the impression,
not that we're looking at a

00:41:09.818 --> 00:41:13.039
gardenscape that is somehow
viewed through a window behind

00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:16.038
the columns,
but it's almost as if we're

00:41:16.038 --> 00:41:20.039
looking at a Japanese screen or
something like that.

00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:24.275
It's a flat surface that has
been decorated with depictions

00:41:24.275 --> 00:41:28.512
of trees, not a view to look at
trees that lie behind these

00:41:28.512 --> 00:41:29.389
columns.
 

00:41:29.389 --> 00:41:33.940
It's very--it's really
fascinatingly done,

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.050
I think.
 

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:39.253
And if we look at a detail of
the wall in the Casa del

00:41:39.253 --> 00:41:42.043
Frutteto over here,
and of a tree,

00:41:42.043 --> 00:41:46.369
and a detail of a tree from
Livia's Villa at Primaporta,

00:41:46.369 --> 00:41:49.818
I think we again see the
differences between the two:

00:41:49.818 --> 00:41:52.701
blue background,
which gives us a sense of

00:41:52.701 --> 00:41:54.880
reality here;
mountains in the background,

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:58.067
as you'll remember;
a black background here,

00:41:58.067 --> 00:42:01.010
gives a very different effect.
 

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:04.099
Here we talked about how the
artist was a particularly good

00:42:04.099 --> 00:42:06.710
observer of nature:
had really gone out and looked

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:10.340
at real trees;
had looked at the way in which

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.447
leaves rustled in the breeze;
had looked at the way in which

00:42:14.447 --> 00:42:17.322
again light falls differently on
leaves--it can bathe them in

00:42:17.322 --> 00:42:19.239
light or it can bathe them in
shadow.

00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:23.873
We looked at the very realistic
way in which the artist depicted

00:42:23.873 --> 00:42:28.067
the birds who are in flight and
then alight on a leaf or a

00:42:28.067 --> 00:42:29.760
branch of the tree.
 

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.369
Look at the difference here.
 

00:42:31.369 --> 00:42:35.096
The leaves are beautifully
rendered, beautifully rendered,

00:42:35.096 --> 00:42:38.300
but they are all rendered
essentially the same.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.648
You don't have the same sense
of the difference of light and

00:42:41.648 --> 00:42:43.800
shadow;
you don't have the same

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.012
sense--these seem immutable,
not as if they could be ruffled

00:42:48.012 --> 00:42:51.010
by the breeze at all,
immutable shapes.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:55.139
And look at the difference in
the bird, who himself,

00:42:55.139 --> 00:43:00.079
or herself, seems to be a shape
against a black background.

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:01.947
You don't get the
sense--there's no sense of

00:43:01.947 --> 00:43:03.423
movement, as you see,
of the birds,

00:43:03.423 --> 00:43:05.639
as you see at the Villa of
Livia at Primaporta.

00:43:05.639 --> 00:43:08.010
The bird is one shape among
many shapes.

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:15.039
The sinuous snake that makes
its way up the tree has--

00:43:15.039 --> 00:43:17.614
you have some sense again
of--they're sort of teasing us

00:43:17.614 --> 00:43:20.052
here--
there's some sense of depth,

00:43:20.052 --> 00:43:23.000
because as it slithers all
along here,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.322
you get the sense that it is
intertwining itself with the

00:43:26.322 --> 00:43:30.635
trunk of the tree,
so that maybe there's a hint of

00:43:30.635 --> 00:43:34.000
some depth and some motion
there.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.242
So there's this interesting
play, I think,

00:43:37.242 --> 00:43:40.010
that the artist has created
here.

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:44.945
But on the whole this again is
a painting that clearly respects

00:43:44.945 --> 00:43:48.050
all the tenets that have come to
be,

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:51.409
from the point of view of these
artists Third Style Roman wall

00:43:51.409 --> 00:43:54.338
painting,
even for a subject as unlikely

00:43:54.338 --> 00:43:56.380
for this as a gardenscape.
 

00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:05.842
We have talked about Third
Style Roman wall painting in

00:44:05.842 --> 00:44:07.000
Campania.
 

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.893
We have talked about the fact
that a lot of it seems to be

00:44:10.893 --> 00:44:15.059
connected in some way to members
of the imperial household.

00:44:15.059 --> 00:44:19.246
And we see the same also in
Rome, and it's to Rome that I

00:44:19.246 --> 00:44:23.778
would now like to turn,
and specifically to the Golden

00:44:23.778 --> 00:44:27.750
House or the Domus Aurea of the
emperor Nero.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:33.487
I show you a view of the famous
octagonal room of Nero's Domus

00:44:33.487 --> 00:44:34.239
Aurea.
 

00:44:34.239 --> 00:44:37.079
It is one of the greatest rooms
in Roman architecture.

00:44:37.079 --> 00:44:40.829
It's an octagonal room that has
a large oculus.

00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:44.050
It is made out of concrete.
 

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:47.260
It has radiating alcoves,
and it is in a sense a

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:50.947
grandiose version of the
frigidarium that we saw

00:44:50.947 --> 00:44:54.090
in the Stabian and Forum Baths
at Pompeii.

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:57.530
It is part of a very major
architectural revolution under

00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:57.960
Nero.
 

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.989
It is extremely important.
 

00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:04.333
We'll talk about it in great
detail, vis-à-vis the

00:45:04.333 --> 00:45:07.050
architecture,
in a later lecture.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:10.380
But I do want to bring up--just
contextually it works better for

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:12.760
me to talk about the paintings
separately,

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.869
and the paintings in connection
to paintings in Pompeii.

00:45:15.869 --> 00:45:19.730
And it's to those paintings
that I'm going to turn now,

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:23.000
the paintings in Nero's Domus
Aurea,

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.978
that we will see are both Third
and also Fourth Style Roman

00:45:27.978 --> 00:45:29.010
paintings.
 

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:32.753
So once again we seem to be in
a situation where we are looking

00:45:32.753 --> 00:45:34.788
at a palace,
in this case,

00:45:34.788 --> 00:45:38.000
commissioned by an imperial
patron,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.192
in which it looks like there
was an important transition from

00:45:43.192 --> 00:45:47.000
one Roman wall painting
decoration style,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.860
to another, in this case the
Third Style to the Fourth Style.

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:54.905
The Domus Aurea paintings are
important for three major

00:45:54.905 --> 00:45:55.840
reasons.
 

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.730
The first reason is we can date
them exactly.

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:04.054
We know that these paintings,
both of the Third and the

00:46:04.054 --> 00:46:07.496
Fourth Styles,
were done in the Domus Aurea,

00:46:07.496 --> 00:46:08.697
between 64 A.D.
 

00:46:08.697 --> 00:46:09.980
and 68 A.D.
 

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.951
We also know,
and we know this very rarely,

00:46:12.951 --> 00:46:17.195
the name of the painter who was
responsible for the Third and

00:46:17.195 --> 00:46:20.449
Fourth Style paintings in the
Domus Aurea.

00:46:20.449 --> 00:46:25.039
His name is one you will,
I hope--you will;

00:46:25.039 --> 00:46:29.407
not hope, I know you will never
forget, because his name was

00:46:29.407 --> 00:46:32.219
Fabullus, F-a-b-u-l-l-u-s,
Fabullus;

00:46:32.219 --> 00:46:34.581
and he was indeed,
as you shall see,

00:46:34.581 --> 00:46:35.730
truly fabulous.
 

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:41.786
Fabullus is known from--we know
him from the writings of Pliny,

00:46:41.786 --> 00:46:44.583
P-l-i-n-y;
many of you have probably read

00:46:44.583 --> 00:46:47.128
the writings of Pliny,
tells us a lot about art,

00:46:47.128 --> 00:46:47.940
ancient art.
 

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:51.710
And Pliny tells us that
Fabullus was the painter for the

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:55.003
Domus Aurea, in Rome,
and he tells us a couple of

00:46:55.003 --> 00:46:58.090
other interesting tidbits about
Fabullus.

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:01.610
He tells us that Fabullus
always used to paint in a toga.

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:07.300
Now painting in a toga is like
painting in a three-piece suit

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.059
today.
 

00:47:08.059 --> 00:47:10.157
You wouldn't paint in
a--painting in a toga,

00:47:10.157 --> 00:47:12.059
it makes no sense to paint in a
toga.

00:47:12.059 --> 00:47:13.454
But he obviously--whether he
really painted in a toga we

00:47:13.454 --> 00:47:15.438
don't know,
but that was his reputation,

00:47:15.438 --> 00:47:17.880
which means he dressed up for
the event,

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.969
took it very seriously.
 

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:23.449
We also know from Pliny that,
or Pliny tells us that the

00:47:23.449 --> 00:47:26.300
Domus Aurea was Fabullus'
prison.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.739
Why was it Fabullus' prison?
 

00:47:28.739 --> 00:47:31.983
It was Fabullus' prison because
any of you who have visited the

00:47:31.983 --> 00:47:33.990
Domus Aurea--
and those of you who haven't,

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:35.577
I hope you will,
when you're in Rome,

00:47:35.577 --> 00:47:37.440
because it's an extraordinary
place to see--

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.909
will see that it is corridor,
after corridor,

00:47:41.909 --> 00:47:43.918
after corridor,
after corridor,

00:47:43.918 --> 00:47:47.871
and we only have today a very
small piece of the Domus Aurea

00:47:47.871 --> 00:47:48.809
preserved.
 

00:47:48.809 --> 00:47:53.795
So if Fabullus' job was to
paint all of the walls and all

00:47:53.795 --> 00:47:57.179
of the ceilings of the Domus
Aurea,

00:47:57.179 --> 00:47:59.590
it would have indeed taken a
lifetime,

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:03.920
it would have indeed served as
a kind of prison for him.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:08.112
I suppose a later--it might be
interesting to think of him in

00:48:08.112 --> 00:48:11.088
connection to--
he was not as great as,

00:48:11.088 --> 00:48:15.085
but he was,
in a sense, the Michelangelo of

00:48:15.085 --> 00:48:17.798
his time;
think about Michelangelo and

00:48:17.798 --> 00:48:21.735
the Sistine Ceiling and all the
time that he devoted to painting

00:48:21.735 --> 00:48:24.360
that extraordinary space,
also in Rome.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.010
I show you a couple of views of
the corridors.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:31.847
I'm not going to go into detail
now on exactly why this is the

00:48:31.847 --> 00:48:36.000
case, but the Domus Aurea is now
underground, it's subterranean.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.173
It was razed to the ground and
covered over in part by a later

00:48:39.173 --> 00:48:41.880
Roman emperor that we'll talk
about in the future.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.619
So when you visit it today,
you need to go underground.

00:48:44.619 --> 00:48:47.503
It was buried for a long time
and rediscovered in the

00:48:47.503 --> 00:48:48.280
Renaissance.
 

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.668
And it's interesting because we
know that the famous painter

00:48:51.668 --> 00:48:53.911
Raphael,
the famous Renaissance painter

00:48:53.911 --> 00:48:56.436
Raphael,
went underground and was one of

00:48:56.436 --> 00:48:59.768
the first to see the paintings
of the Domus Aurea,

00:48:59.768 --> 00:49:02.760
because Raphael left a graffito
on the wall,

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.309
which basically says,
"Raphael was here."

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:09.994
And we're fortunate that he
left that, because it tells us

00:49:09.994 --> 00:49:12.050
again that he was here.
 

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.793
And we're not surprised because
this is a loggetta in the

00:49:14.793 --> 00:49:17.929
Vatican today that was designed
by--it was painted by Raphael.

00:49:17.929 --> 00:49:22.539
And you can see how much the
paintings of the Domus Aurea--

00:49:22.539 --> 00:49:24.474
more weathered,
obviously, than the one on the

00:49:24.474 --> 00:49:27.237
left--
but the paintings of the Domus

00:49:27.237 --> 00:49:30.139
Aurea had a huge impact on
Raphael.

00:49:30.139 --> 00:49:33.550
I'm going to show you three
rooms in the Domus Aurea.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:38.556
The first is the--and I'm sorry
I have to show this to you in

00:49:38.556 --> 00:49:41.768
black and white;
it's the only--it was very hard

00:49:41.768 --> 00:49:44.250
to photograph there,
and it's the only image I

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:45.960
happen to have of this wall.
 

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.614
But I am showing you a room
called the Sala degli

00:49:49.614 --> 00:49:51.864
Uccelletti,
which means the Room of the

00:49:51.864 --> 00:49:54.320
Birds, and like the other
paintings I'm going to show you

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.829
today,
it dates to 64 to 68 A.D.

00:49:57.829 --> 00:50:02.969
You can see that this is a
Third Style Roman wall painting.

00:50:02.969 --> 00:50:06.126
It partakes of all the features
that we've already described for

00:50:06.126 --> 00:50:07.829
Third Style Roman wall painting.
 

00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:12.909
It has a flat wall,
as you can see here.

00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:15.820
It's not painted red or black,
but in this case white,

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.840
which makes it even more
delicate looking,

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:24.833
but they have definitely
observed the integrity of the

00:50:24.833 --> 00:50:28.000
wall and painted it white.
 

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.768
You can also see that the
architectural members that there

00:50:30.768 --> 00:50:33.538
are, are very attenuated and
look like stripes on the wall

00:50:33.538 --> 00:50:34.510
from a distance.
 

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:38.239
You can see that some of the
frames are vegetal or floral:

00:50:38.239 --> 00:50:40.659
very delicate,
as you can see here.

00:50:40.659 --> 00:50:43.202
And then in the central
panels--and it's the reason that

00:50:43.202 --> 00:50:45.099
it's called the Sala degli
Uccelletti--

00:50:45.099 --> 00:50:49.324
we have little birds,
and those little birds float in

00:50:49.324 --> 00:50:54.280
the center of these panels:
once again a decorative motif,

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:58.000
among many.
 

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.813
So the flatness of the wall
observed, a wall that is flat,

00:51:00.813 --> 00:51:02.639
and to be decorated by the
painter.

00:51:02.639 --> 00:51:06.309
So that's the Sala degli
Uccelletti: Third Style.

00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:11.327
This is a vault in the Domus
Aurea, which is useful for us,

00:51:11.327 --> 00:51:16.000
because here we can get a
better sense of the color.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.659
Once again the background is
white, and once again the

00:51:19.659 --> 00:51:22.630
integrity of the wall has been
respected.

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:26.429
The artist has divided that
wall into a series of panels,

00:51:26.429 --> 00:51:30.789
but within those panels we see
once again sea creatures,

00:51:30.789 --> 00:51:35.150
in this case floating in the
center of those framed panels.

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:37.706
We are meant to read them as
framed panels,

00:51:37.706 --> 00:51:39.960
not as views into some other
world.

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:45.559
Note also that some of the
frames are done with vegetal and

00:51:45.559 --> 00:51:47.780
floral motifs:
very,

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:49.838
very delicate,
very attractive,

00:51:49.838 --> 00:51:55.025
very ephemeral in a sense,
very lightweight against that

00:51:55.025 --> 00:51:57.010
white background.
 

00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:00.148
So very much again another
example of Third Style Roman

00:52:00.148 --> 00:52:01.079
wall painting.
 

00:52:01.079 --> 00:52:05.599
But then there is this room,
and this room is Room 78,

00:52:05.599 --> 00:52:10.940
and Room 78 is extremely
important for us,

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:15.059
because we see something else
is happening in Room 78.

00:52:15.059 --> 00:52:17.530
Yes, it does still have a white
wall.

00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:22.684
Yes, it does still use a floral
decoration for some of the

00:52:22.684 --> 00:52:23.500
frames.
 

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:27.677
Yes, it does have framed
panels, in this case not with

00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:31.304
black but with red frames,
as you can see here:

00:52:31.304 --> 00:52:35.090
all elements of the Third
Style, absolutely.

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.969
So it partakes of a number of
Third Style elements.

00:52:37.969 --> 00:52:41.429
The white wall itself is a very
Third Style thing to do.

00:52:41.429 --> 00:52:44.405
But you will notice,
of course, that something new

00:52:44.405 --> 00:52:47.876
has happened here,
and that is more substantial

00:52:47.876 --> 00:52:51.197
architecture has been--
the representation of more

00:52:51.197 --> 00:52:54.780
substantial architecture--
has been reintroduced.

00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.818
If you look at these
architectural elements that

00:52:57.818 --> 00:53:01.711
frame some of the panels,
you will see that we see once

00:53:01.711 --> 00:53:04.918
again real columns,
real columns that seem to

00:53:04.918 --> 00:53:08.704
support projecting lintels,
and then through those--once

00:53:08.704 --> 00:53:11.300
again a white background in this
case--

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:15.469
but through those we see other
elements of architecture.

00:53:15.469 --> 00:53:20.202
Here a two-storied columnar
monument, and over here what

00:53:20.202 --> 00:53:24.764
seems to be a broken triangular
pediment, supported by

00:53:24.764 --> 00:53:26.829
substantial columns.
 

00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:31.737
So architecture is --
substantial architecture is

00:53:31.737 --> 00:53:37.362
reintroduced in the central
zone, flanking the panels on

00:53:37.362 --> 00:53:39.000
either side.
 

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.884
But it is a different
architecture than we've ever

00:53:41.884 --> 00:53:45.179
seen before, because we never
see a complete building.

00:53:45.179 --> 00:53:49.010
We see only fragments of
buildings--

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:52.568
this broken triangular pediment
on its own is an example of

00:53:52.568 --> 00:53:54.117
that--
fragments of buildings,

00:53:54.117 --> 00:53:56.735
which we will see are depicted
in what I would describe as

00:53:56.735 --> 00:53:57.610
illogical space.
 

00:53:57.610 --> 00:54:03.010
They don't look like they're
actually occupying space,

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:04.554
the way a regular building
would, or in what is

00:54:04.554 --> 00:54:05.829
characteristic of the Second
Style,

00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:10.739
but fragments of buildings
depicted in illogical space.

00:54:10.739 --> 00:54:13.880
And then, very important,
in the uppermost zone,

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:18.050
we see a depiction of a number
of these fragments of

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:20.762
architecture,
all jumbled together,

00:54:20.762 --> 00:54:23.780
almost to create a building;
although it isn't a building

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.590
that actually works.
 

00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:27.309
I like to call these
architectural cages,

00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:30.829
because they are individual
elements,

00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:32.760
individual fragments,
again that are grouped

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.670
together,
architectural cages,

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:38.648
that often have in them very
strange mythological and other

00:54:38.648 --> 00:54:42.219
creatures,
most of whom are very difficult

00:54:42.219 --> 00:54:43.820
to identify today.
 

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:47.652
So we see this incredible
transition between the Third

00:54:47.652 --> 00:54:51.884
Style Roman wall painting,
that Fabullus is using for the

00:54:51.884 --> 00:54:54.481
Domus Aurea,
to something that is

00:54:54.481 --> 00:54:58.730
transitioning us into what we
call the Fourth Style.

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:05.039
In fact, I would call this room
a Fourth Style Roman room,

00:55:05.039 --> 00:55:09.159
a Fourth Style painted room,
and the genius behind this I

00:55:09.159 --> 00:55:12.030
would speculate was Fabullus
himself.

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:15.793
I want to show you another
example of Fourth Style,

00:55:15.793 --> 00:55:20.007
because we believe Fourth
Style--remember the date of the

00:55:20.007 --> 00:55:22.039
Domus Aureus,
64 to 68.

00:55:22.039 --> 00:55:25.577
So if it is being--if it is
coming to the fore,

00:55:25.577 --> 00:55:30.115
the Fourth Style at that time,
it means that it is about the

00:55:30.115 --> 00:55:33.039
time of the earthquake in
Pompeii.

00:55:33.039 --> 00:55:36.351
And we do see paintings in
Pompeii that we believe date

00:55:36.351 --> 00:55:40.155
between the earthquake of 62 and
the eruption of Vesuvius of 79

00:55:40.155 --> 00:55:44.019
that are examples also of Fourth
Style Roman wall painting.

00:55:44.019 --> 00:55:45.159
This is one of them.
 

00:55:45.159 --> 00:55:50.050
It's a wall from the House of
the Vestals in Pompeii.

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:53.989
It dates to 62 to 70 A.D.,
and we can see exactly what I

00:55:53.989 --> 00:55:56.570
was describing at the Domus
Aurea.

00:55:56.570 --> 00:56:03.528
We look at the bottom part and
we see that it still looks like

00:56:03.528 --> 00:56:07.684
a Third Style wall,
in that we see golden panels

00:56:07.684 --> 00:56:10.800
and red panels with floating
figures in the center,

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.730
and with floral decorations
around those.

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:18.655
We see over here a mythological
panel with a black frame around

00:56:18.655 --> 00:56:22.579
it that is meant to look like a
panel picture hanging on a flat

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:23.150
wall.
 

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:27.320
All of that is exactly what we
saw in the Third Style.

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.967
But again what separates this
from a Third Style painting is

00:56:30.967 --> 00:56:33.380
this reintroduction of
architecture,

00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:36.599
over here--architecture
presented against a white

00:56:36.599 --> 00:56:40.561
background--
but it's not a full building,

00:56:40.561 --> 00:56:45.192
it is a fragment of a building,
a fragment of a building with

00:56:45.192 --> 00:56:47.206
substantial architectural
members and a projecting

00:56:47.206 --> 00:56:48.070
entablature above.
 

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:50.230
And then in the upper zone,
again against a white

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:52.614
background,
those architectural cages,

00:56:52.614 --> 00:56:56.797
those fragments of architecture
that have been jumbled together

00:56:56.797 --> 00:57:00.980
and are used as a milieu for
these very strange creatures--

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:06.670
animal, human and the
like--that are located in them,

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:11.396
these architectural cages that
are also decorated with strange

00:57:11.396 --> 00:57:15.579
and interesting ornamentation at
the uppermost part.

00:57:15.579 --> 00:57:18.230
So another example of Fourth
Style.

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:22.599
Our very best examples of
Fourth Style Roman wall painting

00:57:22.599 --> 00:57:25.820
all come from a single house in
Pompeii.

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:29.219
It is a house that we looked at
together before.

00:57:29.219 --> 00:57:32.179
It is the House of the Vettii.
 

00:57:32.179 --> 00:57:35.639
You'll remember the kitchen in
the House of the Vettii,

00:57:35.639 --> 00:57:38.202
for example,
the wonderful garden that we

00:57:38.202 --> 00:57:39.420
explored there.
 

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:44.750
It is also a house that has an
incredible array of paintings,

00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:49.460
and it shows us several stages
of the Fourth Style.

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:53.715
And I should mention also that
while we call these styles

00:57:53.715 --> 00:57:55.128
First,
Second, Third,

00:57:55.128 --> 00:57:59.777
and Fourth, as anything else,
they have substyles and

00:57:59.777 --> 00:58:04.612
transition periods;
one can refer to Early Second

00:58:04.612 --> 00:58:08.014
Style, Mature Second Style,
Late Second Style,

00:58:08.014 --> 00:58:11.869
Early Third Style--there are
certain subtleties.

00:58:11.869 --> 00:58:13.934
Because again,
remember, the artists who were

00:58:13.934 --> 00:58:16.480
making these were not thinking,
"Oh, I'm transitioning

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.960
from the Second to the Third
Style."

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.420
They were just moving on.
 

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:23.177
They were experimenting with
things they hadn't experimented

00:58:23.177 --> 00:58:26.489
before, and they soon found
themselves in a different

00:58:26.489 --> 00:58:27.190
milieu.
 

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:28.619
So there are those subtleties.
 

00:58:28.619 --> 00:58:31.000
And we can see those in the
House of the Vettii.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.996
I can show you Early,
Middle and even Late Fourth

00:58:33.996 --> 00:58:37.431
Style at the House of the
Vettii, which is just what I'm

00:58:37.431 --> 00:58:38.679
going to do now.
 

00:58:38.679 --> 00:58:40.818
We're going to begin with
Garden Room Q,

00:58:40.818 --> 00:58:42.849
which is the one that you see
here;

00:58:42.849 --> 00:58:45.980
which you can see,
from the Monument List,

00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:48.730
we believe dates to 62 to 70
A.D.;

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:50.420
Garden Room Q.
 

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:53.099
Now if all of Garden Room Q
that was preserved,

00:58:53.099 --> 00:58:56.478
was the bottom part--if you
didn't have that very top zone,

00:58:56.478 --> 00:58:58.750
and I asked you what style is
this?

00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:02.072
You would probably tell me
Third Style, and you'd be right

00:59:02.072 --> 00:59:03.590
that it was Third Style.
 

00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:07.438
But the addition of that zone
in the uppermost part gives it

00:59:07.438 --> 00:59:09.460
away, as a Fourth Style wall.
 

00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:12.643
But it's again a very good
example of an early one,

00:59:12.643 --> 00:59:15.000
because we can see this
transition.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.536
So in the bottom,
again very much adhering to the

00:59:17.536 --> 00:59:20.498
tenets of Third Style Roman wall
painting: respecting the

00:59:20.498 --> 00:59:24.041
flatness of the wall;
dividing the wall into a series

00:59:24.041 --> 00:59:26.730
of zones;
a socle that's black;

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:30.403
a main section that's red;
sort of wings on either side

00:59:30.403 --> 00:59:31.719
that are also black.
 

00:59:31.719 --> 00:59:33.659
But as you look at this wall
from a distance,

00:59:33.659 --> 00:59:38.050
those black elements look like
stripes,

00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:40.239
large black stripes on the
wall, and even within those

00:59:40.239 --> 00:59:42.139
black stripes we see these very
attenuated,

00:59:42.139 --> 00:59:43.900
delicate colonnettes.
 

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:46.304
Close up you can see that
they're colonnettes,

00:59:46.304 --> 00:59:49.617
but from a distance again they
look like gold stripes on a flat

00:59:49.617 --> 00:59:50.099
wall.
 

00:59:50.099 --> 00:59:56.280
Floating mythological figures
in the center,

00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:01.000
as is characteristic of the
Third Style,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.800
and then there was a panel
painting over here that was

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.500
rudely removed by treasure
hunters at one point.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.206
So panel pictures,
as well as floating

01:00:07.206 --> 01:00:08.889
mythological figures.
 

01:00:08.889 --> 01:00:12.108
And then at the uppermost part
you see this addition:

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:15.152
white ground,
architectural cages,

01:00:15.152 --> 01:00:19.958
as I've described them,
with a whole panoply of

01:00:19.958 --> 01:00:25.699
interesting mythological and
other figures that are inserted

01:00:25.699 --> 01:00:29.010
into those architectural cages.
 

01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:31.981
So a very early example of
Fourth Style Roman wall painting

01:00:31.981 --> 01:00:33.929
in the House of the Vettii in
Rome .

01:00:33.929 --> 01:00:35.820
These again are so interesting
in detail.

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:41.000
If you blow this up to the size
that we see it here,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.909
you will see that this is that
black background in between the

01:00:43.909 --> 01:00:46.010
red panels that we were looking
at before.

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.320
You can see all kinds of
strange things going on here in

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:48.699
detail.
 

01:00:48.699 --> 01:00:51.110
A female figure, semi-naked.
 

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:53.150
She's clashing her cymbals.
 

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:56.420
She's dancing here,
and she is supporting,

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.677
on her head--she's oblivious to
the fact that she's supporting

01:00:58.677 --> 01:01:01.643
on her head --
the base of one of these

01:01:01.643 --> 01:01:04.398
colonnettes;
as you can see here,

01:01:04.398 --> 01:01:08.655
pays no heed whatsoever that
she's serving as a support for

01:01:08.655 --> 01:01:10.050
the colonnettes.
 

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:11.530
And then either side of her
what we call herms,

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:15.750
h-e-r-m-s, which are part human
and part pedestal,

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:21.010
male heads, bearded male heads
carrying libation dishes,

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.242
or whatever,
on either side,

01:01:22.242 --> 01:01:24.800
and then a very interesting
sacrifice scene down here.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.550
So again, as I've said so many
times, looking at these

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:32.938
paintings, the details of these
paintings, is a very intriguing

01:01:32.938 --> 01:01:34.000
experience.
 

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.302
The room that seems to be a
good example of the mid-Fourth

01:01:38.302 --> 01:01:42.077
Style is the House of the
Vettii, Room of Pentheus,

01:01:42.077 --> 01:01:44.719
which we date to around 70 A.D.
 

01:01:44.719 --> 01:01:46.000
You see it here.
 

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.579
It is very well-preserved.
 

01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:50.880
It is a room in which the color
gold abounds.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.302
As you can see,
a maroon socle,

01:01:54.302 --> 01:01:57.039
the gold central zone.
 

01:01:57.039 --> 01:02:01.581
It partakes of Third Style in
that you can see that the main

01:02:01.581 --> 01:02:04.949
parts of the wall are flat,
with a panel,

01:02:04.949 --> 01:02:10.000
a mythological panel picture
that is surrounded by a frame --

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.679
so just to make absolutely sure
that the viewer understands that

01:02:12.679 --> 01:02:15.360
what they are looking at here is
a panel picture that hangs on a

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.632
flat wall,
not a window into something

01:02:17.632 --> 01:02:18.719
that lies beyond.
 

01:02:18.719 --> 01:02:22.306
But we see in this central zone
the reintroduction of

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:25.306
architecture,
substantial architecture,

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:30.010
where you can really make out
the columns and the pediments,

01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:32.581
but not full buildings,
fragments of buildings:

01:02:32.581 --> 01:02:35.934
fragments of buildings that are
represented in very illogical

01:02:35.934 --> 01:02:38.070
space,
as you can see here.

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:41.655
Again, substantial elements
like this, with the supporting

01:02:41.655 --> 01:02:44.862
the columns, supporting the
lintel with the coffered

01:02:44.862 --> 01:02:47.380
ceiling, represented in
perspective.

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:51.000
So all of that brought back.
 

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.547
But again these are not full
buildings, as we would see in

01:02:54.547 --> 01:02:56.974
the Second Style,
but these fragments in

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.219
illogical space.
 

01:02:58.219 --> 01:03:00.965
And a detail again of the same,
that I just described,

01:03:00.965 --> 01:03:04.125
and it's interesting to compare
it to some details from Second

01:03:04.125 --> 01:03:05.679
Style Roman wall painting.
 

01:03:05.679 --> 01:03:09.938
Think Fannius Sinistor or the
Metropolitan Museum Cubiculum,

01:03:09.938 --> 01:03:14.342
where you can actually -- you
really have a sense of what this

01:03:14.342 --> 01:03:15.570
building was.
 

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:18.755
There's a doorway that leads
in, and then there are a series

01:03:18.755 --> 01:03:22.101
of tiers, and there's a balcony,
and everything connects to one

01:03:22.101 --> 01:03:22.750
another.
 

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:24.719
But here we see something quite
different,

01:03:24.719 --> 01:03:27.981
where we see not a whole
building, or parts of a building

01:03:27.981 --> 01:03:30.764
together,
but rather these individual

01:03:30.764 --> 01:03:34.481
pieces that are depicted,
as I mentioned,

01:03:34.481 --> 01:03:37.199
in a very illogical way.
 

01:03:37.199 --> 01:03:40.539
The glory of Fourth Style Roman
wall painting--

01:03:40.539 --> 01:03:43.702
it depends on your taste,
because it's very gaudy as

01:03:43.702 --> 01:03:46.077
well--
but one could say that the

01:03:46.077 --> 01:03:48.603
greatest preserved or--
the most interesting,

01:03:48.603 --> 01:03:51.519
let's put it that way--
the most interesting preserved

01:03:51.519 --> 01:03:55.139
Fourth Style wall is also in the
House of the Vettii.

01:03:55.139 --> 01:03:58.409
It is in the Ixion Room of the
House of the Vettii.

01:03:58.409 --> 01:04:01.639
We believe it dates to 70 to 79.
 

01:04:01.639 --> 01:04:05.702
It is our, an example of
full-blown Fourth Style,

01:04:05.702 --> 01:04:07.820
at its most incredible.
 

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:11.485
And it's almost as if this
artist wanted to be remembered

01:04:11.485 --> 01:04:14.568
for posterity--
we don't know his name

01:04:14.568 --> 01:04:17.789
unfortunately--
but remembered for posterity as

01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:21.141
the person who created the
textbook example of Fourth Style

01:04:21.141 --> 01:04:22.469
Roman wall painting.
 

01:04:22.469 --> 01:04:26.480
And what's fascinating about it
is what he has done is he has

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.153
mixed together all of the
earlier styles:

01:04:29.153 --> 01:04:31.360
First, Second,
Third, Fourth.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:35.059
First we see the socle down
here is--

01:04:35.059 --> 01:04:38.655
it's all done in paint,
but it is painted to represent

01:04:38.655 --> 01:04:41.639
marble or to imitate marble
incrustation,

01:04:41.639 --> 01:04:44.530
just as we saw in the First
Style.

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:47.221
So the marble incrustation of
the First Style,

01:04:47.221 --> 01:04:49.492
used for the socle,
but again in paint,

01:04:49.492 --> 01:04:50.570
not in relief.
 

01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:55.960
The Second tier we see the
substantial columns supporting

01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.483
lintels and entablatures with
coffered ceilings,

01:05:00.483 --> 01:05:05.599
represented in depth;
that's a Second Style element.

01:05:05.599 --> 01:05:07.826
Third Style,
these panels,

01:05:07.826 --> 01:05:12.190
red with mythological paintings
in the center,

01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:15.121
with frames,
and over here a white panel

01:05:15.121 --> 01:05:19.559
with floral decoration and
floating mythological figures;

01:05:19.559 --> 01:05:21.539
those are elements of the Third
Style.

01:05:21.539 --> 01:05:24.503
And the Fourth Style,
reintroduction of architecture

01:05:24.503 --> 01:05:27.588
in the central zone,
fragments of architecture,

01:05:27.588 --> 01:05:30.994
not full buildings,
fragments of architecture

01:05:30.994 --> 01:05:33.309
depicted in illogical space.
 

01:05:33.309 --> 01:05:38.429
And then in the uppermost tier,
these architectural cages,

01:05:38.429 --> 01:05:42.599
peopled with all kinds of
strange figures,

01:05:42.599 --> 01:05:46.550
animals, divinities,
personifications,

01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:48.349
and the like.
 

01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:53.000
So all of those four styles
brought together in one place.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.800
Here's another view,
one that perhaps gives you an

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.132
even better sense,
not of everything I've

01:05:58.132 --> 01:06:01.172
described, but of the overall
appearance of this room as one

01:06:01.172 --> 01:06:02.050
walks into it.
 

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:05.143
It's actually a very small
room, but it gives you the sense

01:06:05.143 --> 01:06:06.050
of grandiosity.
 

01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:08.416
And this is interesting too
because you see in this case the

01:06:08.416 --> 01:06:12.106
artist has kind of matched up --
he's represented two very

01:06:12.106 --> 01:06:15.150
similar fragments,
one on either side,

01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:17.998
that in a sense,
as you stare at it,

01:06:17.998 --> 01:06:21.358
gives you the sense,
or at least gives me the sense,

01:06:21.358 --> 01:06:23.903
that perhaps maybe there is
something that continues behind

01:06:23.903 --> 01:06:26.579
the wall or behind the central
mythological panel picture that

01:06:26.579 --> 01:06:27.369
you see here.
 

01:06:27.369 --> 01:06:31.568
But this is quintessential,
quintessential Fourth Style

01:06:31.568 --> 01:06:33.280
Roman wall painting.
 

01:06:36.889 --> 01:06:43.242
And I think I had--I meant to
show you also one more detail

01:06:43.242 --> 01:06:46.695
here,
where you can see again--here

01:06:46.695 --> 01:06:51.489
you can see one of these
elements with the fragments of

01:06:51.489 --> 01:06:54.445
architecture,
an illogical space in detail,

01:06:54.445 --> 01:06:57.389
and you can see even here too
there are strange things going

01:06:57.389 --> 01:06:57.690
on.
 

01:06:57.690 --> 01:07:01.210
We see masks reintroduced in
the Fourth Style.

01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:06.887
We see in this case that mask
is supported by a panel picture

01:07:06.887 --> 01:07:12.659
that represents a curved staff,
an animal, some baskets on top

01:07:12.659 --> 01:07:14.079
of a table.
 

01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:18.139
You try to interpret exactly
what all this meant.

01:07:18.139 --> 01:07:21.949
But it's interesting how much
detail is put into these.

01:07:21.949 --> 01:07:24.590
Even though each of these
individual items are difficult

01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:26.990
to see,
when you walk into a room like

01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:28.833
this,
you tend to look at the whole,

01:07:28.833 --> 01:07:31.882
not at the individual details,
and yet the artists,

01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:36.568
patrons and so on have paid a
great deal of attention to that

01:07:36.568 --> 01:07:37.349
detail.
 

01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:40.271
I want to show you lastly,
and thought we could talk about

01:07:40.271 --> 01:07:42.579
this for a few minutes ourselves
together,

01:07:42.579 --> 01:07:48.286
one last Fourth Style,
or part of a Fourth Style Roman

01:07:48.286 --> 01:07:50.010
wall painting.
 

01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:54.987
It is a fragmentary wall that
we attribute to the Fourth Style

01:07:54.987 --> 01:07:59.557
that came from Herculaneum,
and dates also to this latest

01:07:59.557 --> 01:08:02.170
phase, sometime to 70 to 79.
 

01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:06.572
And it's quite interesting,
in view not only of what we've

01:08:06.572 --> 01:08:09.492
discussed today,
but in everything we've talked

01:08:09.492 --> 01:08:12.445
about with regard to the four
styles of Roman wall painting in

01:08:12.445 --> 01:08:13.559
the last week or so.
 

01:08:13.559 --> 01:08:18.600
I wondered what part of the
wall you think this came from,

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.109
and what you find interesting
about it,

01:08:22.109 --> 01:08:25.461
vis-à-vis our general
discussion of Roman wall

01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:26.170
painting.
 

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:30.180
Someone like to volunteer to
begin?

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:33.542
Yes?
 

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.680
Student:  This may be
off, but one thing I noticed was

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.569
it looks like curtains up on the
top right-hand--

01:08:37.569 --> 01:08:38.231
Prof: Yes.
 

01:08:38.231 --> 01:08:39.868
Student:
&gt;

01:08:39.868 --> 01:08:40.632
Prof: Yes.
 

01:08:40.632 --> 01:08:43.145
Yes, we've been debating this
whole question of the black

01:08:43.145 --> 01:08:45.179
curtains,
and there's a post now online,

01:08:45.179 --> 01:08:47.158
and I hope that you'll all add
to that,

01:08:47.158 --> 01:08:51.010
as we continue that
conversation.

01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:53.743
This one, in this particular
case, it seems incontrovertible

01:08:53.743 --> 01:08:55.828
that what is represented here is
a curtain.

01:08:55.828 --> 01:08:57.310
There's no question that's a
curtain.

01:08:57.310 --> 01:08:58.550
It's hanging up there.
 

01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:04.273
So we get the sense that it has
been raised on what is a kind of

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:07.090
a stage set that lies behind.
 

01:09:07.090 --> 01:09:08.460
So, great point.
 

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:10.689
What else strikes you about
this?

01:09:10.689 --> 01:09:10.949
Yes?
 

01:09:10.949 --> 01:09:14.730
Student:  Based on the
perspective, wouldn't this be

01:09:14.730 --> 01:09:17.988
like a flanking panel to maybe
the central one?

01:09:17.988 --> 01:09:19.908
Prof: Yes,
based on the perspective that's

01:09:19.908 --> 01:09:21.658
used here,
based on the fact that there's

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:24.363
a white background--
which isn't always the case in

01:09:24.363 --> 01:09:27.332
Fourth Style painting,
but it tends to be the case,

01:09:27.332 --> 01:09:29.893
for most of it--
one could speculate that this

01:09:29.893 --> 01:09:33.313
is either one of those elements
that has been reintroduced in

01:09:33.313 --> 01:09:36.354
the main zone,
on either side of the central

01:09:36.354 --> 01:09:43.100
panel,
or--what else might it be?

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:43.286
Yes?
 

01:09:43.286 --> 01:09:45.658
Student:  The illogical
space on the right.

01:09:45.658 --> 01:09:48.269
Prof: Right,
the illogical--part of a

01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:50.090
building in illogical space.
 

01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:51.770
But it might be in the central
zone,

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:55.448
as one of those side wings,
but it might also be way up in

01:09:55.448 --> 01:09:57.974
the top,
as one of the architectural

01:09:57.974 --> 01:10:00.729
cages that we see in the
uppermost part;

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:02.920
that's also possible.
 

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.159
So what is being depicted here?
 

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:13.618
Obviously a stage set of some
sort.

01:10:13.618 --> 01:10:16.579
How would you describe this
architecture in the foreground?

01:10:21.279 --> 01:10:21.890
You all know.
 

01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:24.819
Just state the obvious.
 

01:10:24.819 --> 01:10:25.805
It looks like,
why?

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:27.939
It looks like Second Style
because--?

01:10:27.939 --> 01:10:29.243
Student:  It's
projecting the--it's

01:10:29.243 --> 01:10:29.689
substantial.
 

01:10:29.689 --> 01:10:32.029
It's in perspective and it's
projecting out.

01:10:32.029 --> 01:10:32.903
Prof: Good.
 

01:10:32.903 --> 01:10:35.038
We have substantial
architectural elements.

01:10:35.038 --> 01:10:38.502
It's clear that these are real
columns with real capitals at

01:10:38.502 --> 01:10:39.090
the top.
 

01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:41.658
Those capitals project into our
space.

01:10:41.658 --> 01:10:48.010
The artist has made an effort
to depict recession into space,

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:49.543
as well, because you can see
the way in which these piers are

01:10:49.543 --> 01:10:50.509
angled,
for example,

01:10:50.509 --> 01:10:53.997
back, to give one the sense
that we are looking at something

01:10:53.997 --> 01:10:55.238
depicted in space.
 

01:10:55.238 --> 01:10:57.846
You can see the coffered
ceiling up here,

01:10:57.846 --> 01:11:01.368
the projecting entablatures,
the mask, which is another

01:11:01.368 --> 01:11:03.649
reference to things theatrical.
 

01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:06.609
But is there one-point
perspective here?

01:11:06.609 --> 01:11:09.100
Or is there any attempt to
depict one-point perspective?

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:11.957
Or is it some other kind of
perspective, and if so,

01:11:11.957 --> 01:11:13.500
what kind of perspective?
 

01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:19.659
What kind of perspective?
 

01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:27.729
No one knows?
 

01:11:27.729 --> 01:11:28.640
Yes?
 

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.550
Student:
&gt;

01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:33.300
Prof: No.
 

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.180
What?
 

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.560
Student: 
&gt;

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:42.520
Prof: Yes,
but it's more like atmospheric

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.000
perspective?
 

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:44.590
No?
 

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:45.350
Disagree?
 

01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:49.274
Atmospheric perspective,
so that again what's in the

01:11:49.274 --> 01:11:52.198
foreground is the outlines are
firm;

01:11:52.198 --> 01:11:54.974
what's in the background is
very, very fuzzy,

01:11:54.974 --> 01:11:56.930
and gets fuzzier and fuzzier.
 

01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:59.380
Let me show you a detail of
this.

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.729
If you blow it up,
you can see--try to count--

01:12:05.729 --> 01:12:07.698
I don't know if you're counting
at all--

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:10.039
but if you try to count the
zones of space here,

01:12:10.039 --> 01:12:11.310
you'd go berserk.
 

01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:15.100
Clearly they are trying to
conjure up space,

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:19.940
something that perhaps recedes,
but it seems to be done by

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:23.000
means of atmospheric
perspective,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.872
where the objects in the
foreground are represented with

01:12:27.872 --> 01:12:30.925
the firmest outlines,
and those in the background

01:12:30.925 --> 01:12:33.368
with the fuzziest outlines,
as you can see here.

01:12:33.368 --> 01:12:35.734
If you blow it up,
you can see that the details

01:12:35.734 --> 01:12:36.609
are incredible.
 

01:12:36.609 --> 01:12:39.180
You can see the decoration in
the friezes.

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:42.814
You can see some of the figural
decoration: the capitals and so

01:12:42.814 --> 01:12:43.868
on and so forth.
 

01:12:43.868 --> 01:12:48.819
But it is lost in this--it is
lost in something of a haze,

01:12:48.819 --> 01:12:50.729
as you can see here.
 

01:12:50.729 --> 01:12:54.497
So it's a very good example of
Fourth Style Roman wall

01:12:54.497 --> 01:12:55.279
painting.
 

01:12:55.279 --> 01:12:58.920
As has been suggested,
it is a piece of the wall.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.779
It could be one of the wings.
 

01:13:00.779 --> 01:13:02.868
It could be in the uppermost
zone.

01:13:02.868 --> 01:13:07.038
It certainly makes reference to
things theatrical.

01:13:07.038 --> 01:13:08.939
It certainly conjures up in
some ways Second Style.

01:13:08.939 --> 01:13:15.390
But it is clearly an example of
Fourth.

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:18.038
And again I'm glad that the
issue of the curtains was

01:13:18.038 --> 01:13:21.300
raised, because I think that's a
particularly interesting one.

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.010
And because here we can really
see a full-bodied curtain,

01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:27.603
I think it will help to add to
the speculation that is already

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:29.444
going on,
in the online forum,

01:13:29.444 --> 01:13:32.340
and about which I hope we can
continue to engage,

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.510
in the days ahead.
 

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:37.310
We will have one last lecture
on Roman painting,

01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:39.720
on Thursday,
which is entitled "Special

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:42.074
Subjects,"
and I'm going to deal there

01:13:42.074 --> 01:13:45.439
with everything I haven't dealt
with in the four styles.

01:13:45.439 --> 01:13:48.988
And then we are going to get
back fully to architecture.

01:13:48.988 --> 01:13:52.502
We'll go to Rome and we'll
begin to look at the

01:13:52.502 --> 01:13:56.550
architecture under the emperors
Augustus and so on.

01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.899
Thanks.

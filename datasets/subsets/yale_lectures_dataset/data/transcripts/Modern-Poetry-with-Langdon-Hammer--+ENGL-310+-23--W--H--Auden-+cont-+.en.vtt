00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.819
Professor Langdon
Hammer: Second Auden

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:19.144
lecture.
I was reading last time from

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:24.106
poems from the '30s,
those love poems:

00:00:24.106 --> 00:00:30.676
"Lay Your Sleeping Head,
My Love," and "This Lunar

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:36.045
Beauty."
The ballad that I read for you,

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:42.243
"As I Walked Out One Evening,"
also a poem about love,

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:46.220
also comes from the later '30s.
 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.648
It is collected though in this
book called Another Time,

00:00:52.648 --> 00:00:56.070
a book Auden published in 1940.
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.009
And I wanted to,
well, let's see,

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:03.509
I'm afraid I've got my order
all mixed up here.

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:10.410
I wanted to show you just the
table of contents of this book

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.076
because it has a number of
masterpieces in it that you are

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:21.405
reading.
It's also significant that it's

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:24.519
organized in the way that it is.
 

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:29.975
The first section is called,
humbly I guess or practically,

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:35.336
"People and Places" and it
includes in it the poem I'll be

00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:40.290
discussing shortly,
"Musée des Beaux Arts."

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.721
There're another couple of
sections, a section called

00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:53.276
"Lighter Poems" that includes
all kinds of song forms:

00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:59.023
"Refugee Blues,"
different kinds of blues,

00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:05.702
and some kind of Gothic,
satirical ballads – "Miss

00:02:05.702 --> 00:02:09.863
Gee,"
"James Honeyman" – poems that

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:15.789
are antecedents for a song like
"Maxwell's Silver Hammer."

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:19.710
This is the kind of thing Auden
was writing.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.881
And then there's also something
else called "Occasional Poems,"

00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:26.909
and in this box Auden has put
"Spain 1937,"

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.095
that great political poem from
the Civil War,

00:02:31.095 --> 00:02:35.376
and these poems that I'll be
discussing today:

00:02:35.376 --> 00:02:37.089
"In Memory of W.B.
 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:41.370
Yeats" and "In Memory of
Sigmund Freud."

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.911
I wanted to call attention to
this book, first of all because

00:02:45.911 --> 00:02:50.603
it shows us these poems embedded
in the actual context in which

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:54.906
they first appeared,
but also to point out the way

00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:58.250
in which Auden has organized his
book.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.516
That is to say,
he has thought of his poems as

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:08.490
belonging to specific categories
and placed them accordingly.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.487
And they have different genres,
different forms suitable to

00:03:12.487 --> 00:03:14.900
different purposes and
occasions.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.003
And this is very much the way
in which Auden imagines himself

00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:24.633
as a poet, I think,
that is, someone writing with a

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:30.230
kind of technical mastery with
access to a whole repertoire of

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.459
traditional forms which are
suitable to different purposes

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.120
and different occasions.
 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.156
This general perspective on his
work is related to the topic

00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:52.789
that I introduced in discussing
"As I Walked Out One Evening,"

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:57.060
and that is the whole question
of perspective in Auden.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.622
You remember I talked about how
that poem seems to include,

00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:03.263
well, at least three different
perspectives:

00:04:03.263 --> 00:04:07.578
that is,
the quoted song of the lover

00:04:07.578 --> 00:04:15.117
who tells his beloved that he
will love her until the end of

00:04:15.117 --> 00:04:19.422
time;
then, there's the voice of the

00:04:19.422 --> 00:04:26.205
clocks who speak from the point
of view of time and correct his

00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:30.151
claims;
and then finally there's a kind

00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:35.945
of narrative voice that seems to
frame the whole thing with that

00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:38.980
image of the river running on.
 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.062
As in that poem,
Auden seems to be able to

00:04:44.062 --> 00:04:50.259
incorporate in his poetry
multiple perspectives,

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.943
each of which comment on or are
framed or conditioned by the

00:04:54.943 --> 00:04:59.230
others, but each of which has
its independent truth,

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.167
you could say.
This is a topic that we'll

00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:06.569
explore more today looking at
other poems.

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.100
I wanted to show you some
photographs.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:17.585
In the 1930s during the
Japanese-Chinese War,

00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:23.709
a prelude to the Second World
War,

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:27.871
Auden went with his friend
Christopher Isherwood to China

00:05:27.871 --> 00:05:32.478
and they created a book together
called Journey to a War

00:05:32.478 --> 00:05:36.640
which includes Isherwood's prose
and Auden's poetry.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.000
It's quite a remarkable book.
 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.113
It also includes photographs
which are presented in an

00:05:44.113 --> 00:05:49.292
interesting way.
We have here two different

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:56.044
photographs of boys,
boys who are classified here as

00:05:56.044 --> 00:06:03.855
"soldiers" and "civilians" and
then grimly are identified as

00:06:03.855 --> 00:06:07.959
"with legs" and "without."
 

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:14.481
There's a kind of interest in
these photographs and in their

00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:21.446
presentation of how--in the ways
in which in war who we are is a

00:06:21.446 --> 00:06:26.310
matter of perspective and point
of view.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.916
The war gave Auden and
Isherwood an opportunity to

00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:39.009
experience what it was like to
be on the ground when planes are

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:46.159
overhead bombing you,
and here's one photograph of

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:50.541
that condition.
And here is another

00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:55.930
illustration of this general
point I wanted to make.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:02.089
There are unidentified corpses
under blankets there.

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:09.399
There are then scattered human
remains and debris.

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:14.831
And the one photograph is
identified as "The Innocent" and

00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:17.500
the other as "The Guilty."
 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:24.839
Well, the great poem on this
general theme in Auden's work is

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:28.019
"Musée des Beaux Arts."
 

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:37.321
It is a poem that Auden wrote
after returning from China in

00:07:37.321 --> 00:07:46.648
December, I believe,
1938, contemplating a return to

00:07:46.648 --> 00:07:57.870
the United States where he had
visited a short time before,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.689
contemplating,
in fact, expatriation;

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:09.428
also, contemplating an imminent
war, a world war that would

00:08:09.428 --> 00:08:17.034
extend the horror that he had
witnessed in China to all of

00:08:17.034 --> 00:08:19.970
Europe and beyond.
 

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.626
Suffering, in other words,
was on his mind,

00:08:23.626 --> 00:08:27.893
and it's the subject,
or rather, art's relation to

00:08:27.893 --> 00:08:31.550
suffering is the subject of this
poem.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:38.596
The poem has as its occasion a
visit to the Musée des Beaux

00:08:38.596 --> 00:08:46.480
Art in Brussels where Auden saw
among other works this painting,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.940
"The Fall of Icarus," that is
painted by Pieter Brueghel.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:59.149
This and other Brueghels are
referred to in the course of the

00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:05.462
poem which proceeds almost as a
kind of imaginary gallery tour

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:11.672
or walk in which Auden as our
companion takes us to different

00:09:11.672 --> 00:09:17.778
works and contemplates their
commentary on the general issue

00:09:17.778 --> 00:09:22.850
that he is raising here:
what is art's relation to

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.441
suffering?
About suffering they were

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.648
never wrong,
The Old Masters:

00:09:28.648 --> 00:09:33.253
how well they understood
Its human position [he's

00:09:33.253 --> 00:09:37.289
concerned with how you position
suffering in

00:09:37.289 --> 00:09:45.410
human life, and he's taking
Brueghel as a model];

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.324
how it takes place
While someone else is eating or

00:09:49.324 --> 00:09:52.059
opening a window or just walking
dully

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:56.389
along [as this line of poetry
itself seems to];

00:09:56.389 --> 00:10:01.100
How, when the aged are
reverently, passionately waiting

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:07.416
For the miraculous birth [now
he's contemplating a Nativity

00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:10.090
scene], there
must always be

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.879
Children who did not specially
want it to happen,

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:16.879
skating
On a pond at the edge of the

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:21.314
wood:
They never forgot [the old

00:10:21.314 --> 00:10:24.145
masters]
That even the dreadful

00:10:24.145 --> 00:10:27.210
martyrdom [and now he's looking
at Brueghel's

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.196
painting "The Massacre of the
Innocents"]

00:10:31.196 --> 00:10:35.506
must run its course
Anyhow in a corner,

00:10:35.506 --> 00:10:41.288
some untidy spot
Where the dogs go on with their

00:10:41.288 --> 00:10:46.190
doggy life and the torturer's
horse [no

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.679
more innocent or guilty than
those boys, I suppose]

00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:53.710
Scratches its innocent behind
on a tree.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:59.295
The Old Masters know the human
position of suffering,

00:10:59.295 --> 00:11:02.410
its position in human life.
 

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:06.238
"Position" is important;
it's an important word for

00:11:06.238 --> 00:11:09.156
Auden here.
He's concerned with how

00:11:09.156 --> 00:11:11.220
experience is placed.
 

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.909
Sometimes he calls this
geography.

00:11:14.909 --> 00:11:18.429
It is a topos,
a motif, and an idea in his

00:11:18.429 --> 00:11:23.322
poetry that Elizabeth Bishop
will take over quite directly

00:11:23.322 --> 00:11:28.129
from him and develop and make
central to her poetry.

00:11:28.129 --> 00:11:33.904
The idea is that things have
meaning in relation to,

00:11:33.904 --> 00:11:40.131
in their connection with,
but also their separation from

00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:43.645
each other.
Suffering is part,

00:11:43.645 --> 00:11:48.487
but only a part and not the
center of human life,

00:11:48.487 --> 00:11:54.238
a repertoire of actions and
conditions and states of being

00:11:54.238 --> 00:11:56.759
that is much larger.
 

00:11:56.759 --> 00:12:01.030
In Brueghel,
in his "Massacre of the

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:08.351
Innocents" – I won't try to
find it now among my slides for

00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:14.330
you--Auden focuses on the
"torturer's horse,"

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:22.998
the animal that is part of the
scene and that motivated by an

00:12:22.998 --> 00:12:32.100
itch, scratches its behind while
the dreadful martyrdom runs its

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.323
course.
In this poem,

00:12:35.323 --> 00:12:41.480
as in other Auden poems,
note the prose rhythms.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:48.009
The poem does seem to at times
walk dully along.

00:12:48.009 --> 00:12:52.761
Auden, like Moore,
is writing in an expository

00:12:52.761 --> 00:12:56.879
manner, I guess an essayistic
manner.

00:12:56.879 --> 00:13:00.879
This is part of the tone of the
poem.

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:07.992
Auden is getting into his
poetry a kind of neo-classical,

00:13:07.992 --> 00:13:15.236
eighteenth-century aesthetic,
an ability to talk about ideas

00:13:15.236 --> 00:13:18.874
in poetry in,
again, a discursive,

00:13:18.874 --> 00:13:24.165
expository manner that includes
humor and that is

00:13:24.165 --> 00:13:29.960
matter-of-fact,
is observant.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.681
Pain, like the tears that I
talked about last time that had

00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:38.833
dried on Auden's pages,
pain is part of the picture,

00:13:38.833 --> 00:13:40.950
but it is just a part.
 

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.370
It's, in a sense,
been put aside.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.384
All of this is a function of
what I'm calling Auden's

00:13:48.384 --> 00:13:51.731
perspectivism.
Any scene borders on other

00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:56.521
scenes where other people are
positioned looking at the same

00:13:56.521 --> 00:14:00.500
thing differently or not looking
at it at all.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:07.193
And this is one of the themes
of the second section of the

00:14:07.193 --> 00:14:13.769
poem where Auden specifically
describes this painting.

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:16.404
He says: In Brueghel's
Icarus,

00:14:16.404 --> 00:14:20.702
for instance….
And this is a poetry in which

00:14:20.702 --> 00:14:26.288
the poet says "for instance,"
just as Moore might have said

00:14:26.288 --> 00:14:30.809
"however."
how everything turns away

00:14:30.809 --> 00:14:32.730
Quite leisurely from the
disaster….

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:40.404
And he's talking about the
shepherd who's looking up to the

00:14:40.404 --> 00:14:47.416
sky, he's talking about the
ploughman who has his back

00:14:47.416 --> 00:14:51.740
turned to the fall;
and where is it?

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.216
It's hard probably for you to
see, but it's hard to find in

00:14:55.216 --> 00:14:58.632
any case because this dramatic
event that is the center of

00:14:58.632 --> 00:15:03.682
Brueghel's pictures – in fact,
these bare legs disappearing

00:15:03.682 --> 00:15:10.294
into the sea as the overreaching
son of Daedalus plunges into the

00:15:10.294 --> 00:15:16.080
water – is not at all in the
center of the picture.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.529
how everything turns away
[Auden observes]

00:15:20.529 --> 00:15:23.430
Quite leisurely from the
disaster;

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.346
the ploughman may
Have heard the splash,

00:15:27.346 --> 00:15:30.897
the forsaken cry,
But for him it was not an

00:15:30.897 --> 00:15:35.971
important failure.…
He's not concerned with flying

00:15:35.971 --> 00:15:38.149
to or beyond the sun.
 

00:15:38.149 --> 00:15:45.065
For him the sun merely shines,
it helps him cultivate the

00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:48.541
land.
the sun shone [of

00:15:48.541 --> 00:15:52.458
necessity]
As it had to on the white legs

00:15:52.458 --> 00:15:56.714
disappearing into the green
Water [the white legs

00:15:56.714 --> 00:15:59.740
disappearing into the green
water];

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:05.440
and the expensive delicate ship
that must have seen

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.360
Something amazing,
a boy falling out of the sky,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:15.919
Had somewhere to get to and
sailed calmly on.

00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:21.190
Well, here Auden wasn't
thinking about Hart Crane,

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.879
but he might have been.
 

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:30.495
It's almost as if this figure
has leaped off the back of the

00:16:30.495 --> 00:16:32.850
boat, as Crane did.
 

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.524
He is, however,
thinking, I suppose,

00:16:36.524 --> 00:16:41.669
about romanticism in general
and its ambitions.

00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:45.919
Here, the sun shines as it had
to.

00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:49.190
What it illuminates are white
legs.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.331
There's a kind of objectivity
in that, there's a kind of

00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:57.740
naturalism.
It shines on green water.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.449
It's as if from a certain
perspective, from the

00:17:01.449 --> 00:17:06.865
perspective of aesthetic form,
these elements of the picture

00:17:06.865 --> 00:17:11.460
are merely elements of the
picture – colors,

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.688
which have meaning as they are
placed in a system of

00:17:15.688 --> 00:17:19.420
relationships and a system of
perspectives.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:25.890
Well, there's a great deal more
to be said about this painting.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:36.933
I think one idea that is worth
emphasizing is the way in which

00:17:36.933 --> 00:17:42.206
the ploughman,
in Auden's account as in

00:17:42.206 --> 00:17:45.672
Brueghel's painting,
has prominence,

00:17:45.672 --> 00:17:50.029
has a greater prominence than
the heroic,

00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:53.140
romantic figure plunging into
the sea.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.980
The ploughman is going about
his ordinary daily work,

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.566
and as he turns these furrows,
we are reminded,

00:18:02.566 --> 00:18:07.888
as Auden surely was reminded,
of the ancient classical

00:18:07.888 --> 00:18:13.109
connection between verse –
meaning the turning,

00:18:13.109 --> 00:18:19.570
in Latin, from one line to
another – and the shaping

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:26.031
action of the plough that
creates these furrows in the

00:18:26.031 --> 00:18:29.139
earth,
committing the poet,

00:18:29.139 --> 00:18:34.336
as he identifies with the
ploughman, to a kind of poetry

00:18:34.336 --> 00:18:38.400
of craft and of the earth that
involves,

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:44.079
in a sense, turning away from
disaster.

00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:50.990
Well, this poem was written in
Europe.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:19:00.931
It is a poem that Auden – let
me find this picture here –

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:06.828
with which Auden,
in a sense, turns his back on

00:19:06.828 --> 00:19:12.610
Europe and, for the moment at
least, the imminent world war.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:18.441
He comes to the United States;
he immigrates to the United

00:19:18.441 --> 00:19:21.990
States in January 1939.
 

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:30.970
This personal turning point in
a poetic career comes at a

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:39.309
moment when the world is about
to be split in war.

00:19:39.309 --> 00:19:47.040
It also comes at a significant
moment in literary history when

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:54.645
Yeats dies, and Auden recognizes
this occasion as a moment to

00:19:54.645 --> 00:20:01.746
celebrate the poet,
contemplate the achievement in

00:20:01.746 --> 00:20:09.559
modern poetry that he represents
Yeats and, in a sense,

00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:17.795
provide a kind of epitaph for a
poetry now in the past and

00:20:17.795 --> 00:20:24.730
behind us that positions Auden
in the present.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:31.380
Let's look at the view of Yeats
and of Yeats's poetry that

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.824
emerges here.
The poem extends the questions

00:20:35.824 --> 00:20:41.303
of "Musée des Beaux Arts" by
asking not so much what is art's

00:20:41.303 --> 00:20:46.602
relation to suffering as what is
the place of art in society

00:20:46.602 --> 00:20:50.380
generally,
or poetry in particular?

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.072
Auden begins:
He disappeared in the

00:20:54.072 --> 00:20:56.562
dead of winter:
The brooks were frozen,

00:20:56.562 --> 00:21:01.939
the air-ports almost deserted,
And snow disfigured the public

00:21:01.939 --> 00:21:05.099
statues;
The mercury sank in the mouth

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:06.490
of the dying day.
 

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:13.607
Oh, all the instruments agree
The day of his death was a dark

00:21:13.607 --> 00:21:18.176
cold day.
There's a sense,

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:26.380
as Auden elaborates these
ideas, that natural science is

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:34.585
here mocking the pathetic
fallacy that all nature should

00:21:34.585 --> 00:21:44.430
mourn when the poet dies and
reflect the grief of this event.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.580
He's saying,
Auden is, it was a cold day and

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:54.371
we had instruments to measure it
and that that's what it was,

00:21:54.371 --> 00:21:57.170
in a kind of factual way.
 

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.280
He continues, Auden does:
 

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.680
 
 

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.414
Now he [Yeats]
is scattered among a hundred

00:22:05.414 --> 00:22:07.142
cities
And wholly given over to

00:22:07.142 --> 00:22:08.520
unfamiliar affections….
 

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.809
…
The words of a dead man

00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:16.700
Are modified in the guts of the
living.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.549
Yeats is passed on to us.
 

00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:24.270
And yet to whom has he passed
on?

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:28.809
What difference does he make?
 

00:22:28.809 --> 00:22:33.315
Auden doesn't want us to make
the mistake of thinking that

00:22:33.315 --> 00:22:37.900
Yeats is too central a figure,
that he matters too much.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.601
But in the importance and
noise of to-morrow [he

00:22:41.601 --> 00:22:44.161
continues]
When the brokers are roaring

00:22:44.161 --> 00:22:46.619
like beasts on the floor of the
Bourse,

00:22:46.619 --> 00:22:49.531
And the poor have the
sufferings to which they are

00:22:49.531 --> 00:22:53.079
fairly accustomed,
And each in the cell of himself

00:22:53.079 --> 00:22:55.819
is almost convinced of his
freedom;

00:22:55.819 --> 00:23:00.390
A few thousand will think of
this day

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.845
As one thinks of a day when one
did something slightly

00:23:04.845 --> 00:23:08.526
unusual.
This is an attempt to,

00:23:08.526 --> 00:23:13.091
in some sense,
place poetry realistically in

00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:15.960
culture.
It doesn't matter to the

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.069
brokers "roaring like beasts on
the floor of the Bourse."

00:23:20.069 --> 00:23:22.607
It doesn't matter to the poor
who have their suffering "to

00:23:22.607 --> 00:23:24.210
which they are fairly
accustomed."

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:28.643
It matters, well,
perhaps to "a few thousand"

00:23:28.643 --> 00:23:34.789
people, not a negligible number
but not a large one either.

00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:39.295
There's a kind of modesty in
Auden's claims for Yeats,

00:23:39.295 --> 00:23:42.915
for poetry.
You could contrast Pound at the

00:23:42.915 --> 00:23:47.946
same time as this poem is being
written, broadcasting his ideas

00:23:47.946 --> 00:23:51.462
on Fascist radio,
or you could think about

00:23:51.462 --> 00:23:55.800
Stevens at the same time
dreaming up a poem he will call

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.640
"Notes Toward a Supreme
Fiction."

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:04.700
This is a rather different
claim for what poetry might do.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.809
It returns to a theme of The
Waste Land.

00:24:07.809 --> 00:24:13.379
Somehow, the world that Auden
is describing is one in which we

00:24:13.379 --> 00:24:17.670
are each imprisoned in the cell
of ourselves,

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:26.220
recalling the locked chambers
of Eliot's poem.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:34.801
In the second section,
Auden moves to address Yeats

00:24:34.801 --> 00:24:38.559
directly.
Now Yeats has,

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:46.704
in a sense, claimed for us his
difference, the vatic powers of

00:24:46.704 --> 00:24:52.980
language, the visionary
ambition, and the occult

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:57.679
learning.
All of that that would

00:24:57.679 --> 00:25:03.982
distinguish and separate him
from us is put aside,

00:25:03.982 --> 00:25:09.769
and what he shares with us is
emphasized:

00:25:09.769 --> 00:25:16.802
You were silly like us
[silly]: your gift survived it

00:25:16.802 --> 00:25:18.984
all;
[it had to survive a lot,

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:22.622
it had to survive]
The parish of rich women,

00:25:22.622 --> 00:25:25.256
[who doted on him,
his own]

00:25:25.256 --> 00:25:32.019
physical decay,
Yourself [himself; Auden says];

00:25:32.019 --> 00:25:34.769
mad Ireland hurt you into
poetry.

00:25:34.769 --> 00:25:38.697
Now Ireland has her madness and
her weather still [you did not

00:25:38.697 --> 00:25:43.147
affect it,
you did not affect it because

00:25:43.147 --> 00:25:46.825
you are a man and only a man.
 

00:25:46.825 --> 00:25:50.584
In fact],
For poetry makes nothing

00:25:50.584 --> 00:25:55.991
happen.…
This is one of the most quoted

00:25:55.991 --> 00:26:03.329
sentences in modern poetry:
"poetry makes nothing happen."

00:26:03.329 --> 00:26:09.340
It is almost always quoted,
however, out of context.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.569
It is part of a long sentence.
 

00:26:12.569 --> 00:26:18.388
It comes first as a
qualification on what Yeats,

00:26:18.388 --> 00:26:24.329
on the difference Yeats has
made in the world.

00:26:24.329 --> 00:26:27.618
Auden's saying in a sense,
no, you haven't made a

00:26:27.618 --> 00:26:30.769
difference, for poetry makes
nothing happen.

00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:34.759
But the poem continues then,
the sentence continues.

00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:40.630
Auden says, (colon):
"it survives."

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:44.160
"…Poetry makes nothing
happen: it survives."

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.450
Where?
It survives:

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:50.410
In the valley of its
saying where executives

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:54.130
Would never want to tamper,
it flows south

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:58.200
From ranches of isolation and
the busy griefs,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.250
Raw towns that we believe and
die in;

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:06.775
it survives,
A way of happening,

00:27:06.775 --> 00:27:12.700
a mouth.
Poetry doesn't make things

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.654
happen.
It has a different kind of

00:27:15.654 --> 00:27:18.220
action.
It survives;

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.983
it lasts.
How does it last,

00:27:20.983 --> 00:27:22.200
where does it last?
 

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.853
It lasts "in the valley of its
saying," a kind of imaginary

00:27:26.853 --> 00:27:31.507
landscape or a kind of world
that is created through speech

00:27:31.507 --> 00:27:34.349
here.
"The valley of its saying":

00:27:34.349 --> 00:27:38.903
perhaps a rich place to live
but also a space that evokes a

00:27:38.903 --> 00:27:41.730
kind of absence or hollow,
right?

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.970
Or a kind of opening perhaps,
or a gap.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:57.462
As Auden develops this idea the
poetry becomes what he calls "a

00:27:57.462 --> 00:28:02.369
way of happening,
a mouth."

00:28:02.369 --> 00:28:07.040
And then that valley is
refigured as a mouth – an open

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.776
mouth, I'm sure,
a mouth open where words are

00:28:10.776 --> 00:28:15.827
coming out,
where more words will follow

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:20.009
and flow like a kind of river.
 

00:28:20.009 --> 00:28:23.750
Poetry, in that sense,
doesn't make anything happen.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:27.341
It is rather a way of
happening, that is,

00:28:27.341 --> 00:28:31.562
a kind of method or model,
a path or discipline:

00:28:31.562 --> 00:28:35.379
a way.
Not a deed, but something more

00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:41.316
like the symbol of a deed or the
figure of a kind of potential

00:28:41.316 --> 00:28:45.326
action,
a nothing that is somehow

00:28:45.326 --> 00:28:48.969
something, too,
again, I think,

00:28:48.969 --> 00:28:53.220
an image implying an open
mouth;

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:58.125
that is, the mouth of a river
or the mouth of a poet,

00:28:58.125 --> 00:29:01.050
through which language flows.
 

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:05.200
 
 

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:12.354
Then the poem moves into,
I think, a kind of illustration

00:29:12.354 --> 00:29:18.359
of the kind of action that
poetry engages in,

00:29:18.359 --> 00:29:24.120
and that comes with the
movement into these ceremonial

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:29.120
quatrains in iambic tetrameter,
essentially.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.049
Is that what it is?
 

00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:36.070
Well, it's definitely a
tetrameter.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:40.769
The rhyme enters.
 

00:29:40.769 --> 00:29:47.192
The prose rhythms of the poem
up to now give way to a kind of

00:29:47.192 --> 00:29:50.190
ceremonial lyric language.
 

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:59.390
Here poetry is identified with
praise and with prayer.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:07.257
The poem gives us a kind of
performative language of human

00:30:07.257 --> 00:30:15.683
ceremony that honors Yeats,
that lays him to rest and yet

00:30:15.683 --> 00:30:25.140
also absorbs and affirms the
power of poetry that was in him.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.070
Earth,
receive an honoured guest;

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:31.040
William Yeats is laid to rest.
 

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:39.759
Let the Irish vessel lie
Emptied of its poetry.

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:50.617
Auden goes on to describe the
way that time will honor poetry

00:30:50.617 --> 00:30:57.496
and will honor Yeats;
that time will even,

00:30:57.496 --> 00:31:05.376
he says – Auden does –
forgive Yeats for the right-wing

00:31:05.376 --> 00:31:12.847
politics that Yeats's later
career is marked by and that

00:31:12.847 --> 00:31:21.270
Auden separates himself from and
needs to come to terms with in

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:24.930
this poem.
He says:

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.090
Time with this strange
excuse

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:31.187
Pardoned Kipling and his views,
And will pardon Paul Claudel

00:31:31.187 --> 00:31:35.700
[Kipling, for his imperial
jingoism, Claudel

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:43.575
for his proto-Fascist ideas],
Pardons him [Yeats also]

00:31:43.575 --> 00:31:48.782
for writing well.
Auden, looking back on this

00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:54.960
poem, would ask himself,
how could I possibly presume to

00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:01.250
judge Yeats and forgive him
morally for his politics?

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:08.160
And he struck these
condescending lines from his

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.247
poem.
So, you won't find them in

00:32:11.247 --> 00:32:16.152
The Collected Poems but
you will find the powerful lines

00:32:16.152 --> 00:32:18.210
that proceed from them.
 

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.390
In the nightmare of the
dark

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:24.600
All the dogs of Europe bark,
And the living nations wait,

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:30.890
Each sequestered in its hate;
Intellectual disgrace

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.269
Stares from every human face,
And the seas of pity lie

00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:37.860
Locked and frozen in each
eye.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.750
 
 

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:45.230
What does the poet do in this
condition?

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:51.355
Follow, poet, follow right
To the bottom of the

00:32:51.355 --> 00:32:57.412
night….
The poet descends and descends

00:32:57.412 --> 00:33:06.996
into night, a night that is this
nightmare in which Europe barks,

00:33:06.996 --> 00:33:10.890
ready to attack itself.
 

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:12.990
With your unconstraining
voice

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:20.498
Still persuade us to rejoice;
With the farming of a verse

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:25.500
[and remember the ploughman now,
as a figure for the poet]

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:30.310
Make a vineyard of the curse,
Sing of human unsuccess

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.720
In a rapture of distress;
In the deserts of the heart

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:40.140
Let the healing fountains start,
In the prison of his days

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.900
Teach the free man how to
praise.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.970
This is what poetry can offer.
 

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:52.210
It can offer a lesson in how to
praise.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:58.281
This is not making something
happen politically in the world,

00:33:58.281 --> 00:34:03.645
perhaps, but it's making
something happen in the heart

00:34:03.645 --> 00:34:09.616
and perhaps within the eye of
each of us who look locked and

00:34:09.616 --> 00:34:14.900
staring with our pity,
frozen there.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:23.058
Poetry would be a kind of
farming in the desert of the

00:34:23.058 --> 00:34:32.602
heart that would break open that
which is locked there and free

00:34:32.602 --> 00:34:37.307
feeling.
It's a powerful and very

00:34:37.307 --> 00:34:42.190
traditional claim for what poems
can do.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:47.295
And in talking about The
Waste Land,

00:34:47.295 --> 00:34:54.468
I stressed the ways in which
Eliot sought language of public

00:34:54.468 --> 00:35:01.033
ritual that might join people
separated in the cells of

00:35:01.033 --> 00:35:05.409
themselves.
Here, Auden is working through

00:35:05.409 --> 00:35:10.184
the same ideas and providing a
kind of model for how that might

00:35:10.184 --> 00:35:15.137
work.
Let me turn ahead with you to

00:35:15.137 --> 00:35:23.664
another great poem from this
period, "In Memory of Sigmund

00:35:23.664 --> 00:35:29.800
Freud."
Freud is a kind of ploughman.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.440
He is another model for the
poet, for Auden.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:40.845
And this poem proposes still
other ways to understand

00:35:40.845 --> 00:35:47.989
poetry's relation to suffering,
represented here by Freud's

00:35:47.989 --> 00:35:52.670
humanistic, therapeutic
technique.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.840
What sort of hero is Freud?
 

00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:01.340
Auden calls him "an important
Jew who died in exile."

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:06.891
It's significant that he is
called that by Auden at this

00:36:06.891 --> 00:36:10.275
moment.
If you look for the figure of

00:36:10.275 --> 00:36:15.567
the Jew in "Gerontion," Eliot's
early poem, you'll see that the

00:36:15.567 --> 00:36:19.920
figure is not dignified with a
capital J.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:26.268
Anti-Semitism is a crisis in
Europe and it's certainly a

00:36:26.268 --> 00:36:30.539
pervasive current in modern
poetry.

00:36:30.539 --> 00:36:36.823
Whether it is actually a theme
or a motif, as it appears in

00:36:36.823 --> 00:36:41.374
Eliot or Pound,
or simply a kind of voluble

00:36:41.374 --> 00:36:47.550
prejudice as you would find it
in Williams's letters,

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:51.179
anti-Semitism is powerful.
 

00:36:51.179 --> 00:36:58.484
And here, Auden is identifying
himself with Freud as a Jew and

00:36:58.484 --> 00:37:00.880
as a Jew in exile.
 

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:08.277
And it seems as though Freud in
this way represents a figure for

00:37:08.277 --> 00:37:14.971
people who are in some sense
extracted from the nation and

00:37:14.971 --> 00:37:20.489
who are international in their
perspective.

00:37:20.489 --> 00:37:28.091
And Auden himself is writing in
America from a similar point of

00:37:28.091 --> 00:37:30.772
view.
As in the Yeats elegy,

00:37:30.772 --> 00:37:34.335
Auden is reluctant to single
Freud out when,

00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:39.389
as he says, death is so common
and suffering is so common.

00:37:39.389 --> 00:37:44.833
But Freud's point of view for
Auden is powerful and valuable

00:37:44.833 --> 00:37:50.276
precisely because it emphasizes
the commonplaceness of human

00:37:50.276 --> 00:37:52.860
suffering, its ubiquity.
 

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:57.530
 
 

00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:03.145
He's praised – Freud is –
as the poem unfolds,

00:38:03.145 --> 00:38:10.250
specifically for the ways in
which he responds to suffering.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:14.989
How does he do it?
 

00:38:14.989 --> 00:38:23.533
Well, around line 28 or so,
on page 804,

00:38:23.533 --> 00:38:28.824
Auden says:
All that he did was to

00:38:28.824 --> 00:38:33.857
remember
Like the old and be honest like

00:38:33.857 --> 00:38:37.590
children.
He wasn't clever at all [he was

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:39.929
silly like us]:
he merely told

00:38:39.929 --> 00:38:42.330
The unhappy Present to recite
the Past

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:48.572
Like a poetry lesson till sooner
Or later it faltered at the

00:38:48.572 --> 00:38:51.500
line where
Long ago the accusations had

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.487
begun,
And suddenly knew by whom it

00:38:54.487 --> 00:38:58.589
had been judged,
How rich life had been and how

00:38:58.589 --> 00:39:03.417
silly [there's that word again],
And was life-forgiven and more

00:39:03.417 --> 00:39:05.989
humble,
…

00:39:05.989 --> 00:39:10.389
No wonder the ancient cultures
of conceit

00:39:10.389 --> 00:39:13.646
In his technique of
unsettlement [that's what he

00:39:13.646 --> 00:39:17.939
(Auden) calls Freud's
therapeutic technique,

00:39:17.939 --> 00:39:22.356
the talking cure:
it's a technique of

00:39:22.356 --> 00:39:26.258
unsettlement]
The fall of princes,

00:39:26.258 --> 00:39:29.389
the collapse of
Their lucrative patterns of

00:39:29.389 --> 00:39:31.783
frustration.
If he had succeeded [Freud],

00:39:31.783 --> 00:39:34.474
why, the Generalised Life
Would become impossible,

00:39:34.474 --> 00:39:37.260
the monolith
Of State be broken and prevented

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:40.559
The co-operation of avengers.
 

00:39:40.559 --> 00:39:47.511
Of course they called on God
[his (Freud's) detractors]:

00:39:47.511 --> 00:39:52.096
but he went his
way [like the poet who follows

00:39:52.096 --> 00:39:54.940
right to the bottom of the
night],

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.670
Down among the Lost People like
Dante, down

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.289
To the stinking fosse where the
injured

00:40:00.289 --> 00:40:03.110
Lead the ugly life of the
rejected.

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:07.019
And showed us what evil is:
not as we thought

00:40:07.019 --> 00:40:10.110
Deeds that must be punished,
but our lack of faith,

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:15.888
Our dishonest mood of denial,
The concupiscence of the

00:40:15.888 --> 00:40:26.182
oppressor.
Auden emphasizes Freud's

00:40:26.182 --> 00:40:33.219
literary dimensions.
 

00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:37.889
The talking cure is like a
poetry lesson.

00:40:37.889 --> 00:40:44.996
It puts faith in speech,
in the powers of true speech,

00:40:44.996 --> 00:40:51.030
to correct and reshape and heal
human life.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:56.701
It is a technique of
unsettlement that is a threat to

00:40:56.701 --> 00:41:03.214
princes, all worldly authority,
because it questions authority

00:41:03.214 --> 00:41:08.655
and empowers the individual
speaker to take life into his

00:41:08.655 --> 00:41:12.230
hands.
Like Dante or like Pound's

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:18.151
Ulysses in Canto I,
like the poet at the end of the

00:41:18.151 --> 00:41:22.169
Yeats elegy,
Freud, in Auden's poem,

00:41:22.169 --> 00:41:28.370
goes down among the lost people
and goes into "the stinking

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.409
fosse,"
which is a powerful word.

00:41:31.409 --> 00:41:37.396
It's a word that appears in
Canto I where Ulysses,

00:41:37.396 --> 00:41:41.780
Pound's Ulysses,
goes to seek Tiresias.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.329
"Fosse," it's an Anglo-Saxon
word.

00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:48.469
It reaches back,
in that sense,

00:41:48.469 --> 00:41:56.748
in cultural history to suggest
that our present misery is one

00:41:56.748 --> 00:42:02.820
with, continuous with,
that of the past.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:10.082
And yet history is something
here that can be intervened in,

00:42:10.082 --> 00:42:16.975
in an individual way through
the kind of true speech that

00:42:16.975 --> 00:42:24.730
Auden celebrates in Freud and
that he aspires to in poetry.

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:35.105
As the elegy builds towards its
conclusion, on page 806,

00:42:35.105 --> 00:42:40.010
again the night appears.
 

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:44.045
Freud:
… would have us

00:42:44.045 --> 00:42:46.994
remember most of all
To be enthusiastic over the

00:42:46.994 --> 00:42:50.180
night [and its lost people,
ourselves]

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:55.381
Not only for the sense of wonder
It alone has to offer [night,

00:42:55.381 --> 00:42:58.250
the unconscious],
but also

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:03.420
Because it needs our love:
for with sad eyes

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.429
Its delectable creatures look
up and beg

00:43:06.429 --> 00:43:09.860
Us dumbly to ask them to
follow….

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:15.964
That is, all the properties
here of the unconscious that are

00:43:15.964 --> 00:43:21.862
identified at the same time with
all those who are lost in

00:43:21.862 --> 00:43:27.140
society and need to be
represented and claimed.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.070
They are, like Freud:
…exiles who long for

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:35.110
the future
That lies in our power.

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:39.139
[Again a power of speech.]
They too would rejoice

00:43:39.139 --> 00:43:42.085
If allowed to serve
enlightenment like him [like

00:43:42.085 --> 00:43:45.260
Freud],
Even to bear our cry of "Judas,"

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.599
As he did and all must bear who
serve it.

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:59.406
Freud here is in exile,
and he brings insight but he

00:43:59.406 --> 00:44:03.059
also brings love.
 

00:44:03.059 --> 00:44:08.660
Auden is imagining a kind of
general state of homelessness,

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:13.778
which Freud's technique of
unsettlement isn't meant to

00:44:13.778 --> 00:44:19.861
redress but rather to recognize
and accept and help us adjust to

00:44:19.861 --> 00:44:25.179
and live in.
Auden's own technique here

00:44:25.179 --> 00:44:32.199
is--well, his verse form is a
simple syllable count:

00:44:32.199 --> 00:44:35.779
11 syllables,
11 syllables,

00:44:35.779 --> 00:44:38.670
9 syllables,
10.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:43.617
The normative ten-syllable line
comes last and fourth and gives

00:44:43.617 --> 00:44:46.809
a kind of resolution to each
quatrain.

00:44:46.809 --> 00:44:50.222
This simple pattern,
again, accommodates and

00:44:50.222 --> 00:44:54.705
promotes a kind of prose speech,
a kind of ordinariness that

00:44:54.705 --> 00:44:58.476
identifies Freud's work and the
poet's work with a kind of

00:44:58.476 --> 00:45:02.128
ordinary,
ongoing work and that

00:45:02.128 --> 00:45:08.117
accommodates rationality in a
rational voice,

00:45:08.117 --> 00:45:13.969
as Auden will describe Freud's
as being,

00:45:13.969 --> 00:45:20.177
and yet also accommodates
feeling at the same time and

00:45:20.177 --> 00:45:22.519
accommodates love.
 

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:28.189
One rational voice is
dumb [Freud's,

00:45:28.189 --> 00:45:33.719
he's silent]:
over a grave [his grave]

00:45:33.719 --> 00:45:40.380
The household of Impulse mourns
one dearly loved [because he

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:45.010
understood how to love our
impulses].

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:50.551
Sad is Eros, builder of cities,
And weeping anarchic

00:45:50.551 --> 00:45:58.648
Aphrodite.
It's eventually a powerful,

00:45:58.648 --> 00:46:03.059
moving conclusion.
 

00:46:03.059 --> 00:46:08.250
Eros and Aphrodite have lost
their champion.

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:13.429
I'm going to conclude by
commenting very quickly,

00:46:13.429 --> 00:46:18.954
since we're almost out of time,
on one last poem,

00:46:18.954 --> 00:46:25.078
arguably Auden's greatest,
"In Praise of Limestone," a

00:46:25.078 --> 00:46:30.972
poem written from the
perspective of the post-war in

00:46:30.972 --> 00:46:36.835
the United States,
but about a kind of imaginary

00:46:36.835 --> 00:46:43.910
landscape that combines elements
of his childhood – a landscape

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:50.210
in northern England – and the
Italian landscape where he

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:57.174
returned in the post-War period
and became increasingly attached

00:46:57.174 --> 00:47:01.881
to.
It is a kind of allegorical

00:47:01.881 --> 00:47:09.750
space and it represents a home,
I suppose, for the homeless,

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:16.820
for we, "the inconstant ones,"
as he describes us.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.994
It is, this limestone
landscape, something to be

00:47:20.994 --> 00:47:24.369
praised, and it is a poem of
praise.

00:47:24.369 --> 00:47:31.438
It is an image of the world
without another transcendental

00:47:31.438 --> 00:47:34.909
world beyond or behind it.
 

00:47:34.909 --> 00:47:39.441
To be in the world,
as described in this poem,

00:47:39.441 --> 00:47:43.469
is to be in an entirely earthly
realm.

00:47:43.469 --> 00:47:49.785
And again, you might think of
the ploughman turning away from

00:47:49.785 --> 00:47:56.100
the over-reacher who tried to
fly to the sky and turns rather

00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.813
to the earth.
It is a landscape like that of

00:48:00.813 --> 00:48:03.639
Stevens in "Sunday Morning."
 

00:48:03.639 --> 00:48:12.099
It is a landscape that Auden
can only describe as a kind of

00:48:12.099 --> 00:48:19.830
imaginary place through
counter-factual statements.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:26.145
It is porous.
It's rich, it's fertile,

00:48:26.145 --> 00:48:27.860
and it's moderate.
 

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:32.620
It is not a place of extremes;
and hermits and Caesars;

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:33.900
they don't belong here.
 

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.829
They go elsewhere.
 

00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:43.127
It's rather a place in which
ordinary life and ordinary

00:48:43.127 --> 00:48:45.829
people might live.
 

00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:51.550
The very end of the poem is
extremely powerful because it

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:56.250
looks towards a kind of redeemed
human life,

00:48:56.250 --> 00:49:02.658
sees it in this landscape,
and yet represents it in the

00:49:02.658 --> 00:49:07.568
conditional.
Auden says--this is on page

00:49:07.568 --> 00:49:11.314
808:
In so far as we have to

00:49:11.314 --> 00:49:15.092
look forward
To death as a fact [something

00:49:15.092 --> 00:49:18.600
he will never let us forget],
no doubt we

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:24.000
are right: But if
Sins can be forgiven,

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.210
if bodies rise from the dead
[and you note the

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:33.430
conditional in both phrases],
These modifications of matter

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:36.560
into
Innocent athletes [the people

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.940
that he peoples this landscape
with]

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.659
and
gesticulating fountains,

00:49:41.659 --> 00:49:46.199
Made solely for pleasure,
make a further point:

00:49:46.199 --> 00:49:50.120
The blessed will not care what
angle they are regarded from,

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.050
Having nothing to hide.
 

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:58.470
Dear [and now he speaks to a
beloved], I know

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:01.057
nothing of
Either [that is,

00:50:01.057 --> 00:50:06.239
what it would mean to be
blessed or to have nothing to

00:50:06.239 --> 00:50:09.381
hide: I know nothing of either
of those things],

00:50:09.381 --> 00:50:12.130
but when I try to imagine a
faultless love

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:16.949
Or the life to come,
what I hear is the murmur

00:50:16.949 --> 00:50:21.204
Of underground streams,
what I see is a limestone

00:50:21.204 --> 00:50:25.286
landscape.
A landscape that is Auden's

00:50:25.286 --> 00:50:30.536
version of an earthly paradise
and our only image of these

00:50:30.536 --> 00:50:32.469
ultimate promises.
 

00:50:32.469 --> 00:50:39.356
Auden manages somehow here to
make us see and feel what the

00:50:39.356 --> 00:50:44.992
life to come might be like,
what it might be like to be

00:50:44.992 --> 00:50:49.054
blessed, while still
acknowledging that we can only

00:50:49.054 --> 00:50:53.440
live in and be in and speak in
the world before us,

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:59.343
which is the one that Auden
remains, throughout his poetry,

00:50:59.343 --> 00:51:05.708
dedicated to.
Well, we'll go on to a poet

00:51:05.708 --> 00:51:14.132
closely identified with Auden,
Elizabeth Bishop,

00:51:14.132 --> 00:51:17.000
on Wednesday.

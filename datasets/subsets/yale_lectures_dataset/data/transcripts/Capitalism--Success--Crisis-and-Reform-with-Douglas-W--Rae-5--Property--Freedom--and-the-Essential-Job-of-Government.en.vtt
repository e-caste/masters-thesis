00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.615
Prof: Okay,
today's discussion relies on

00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:08.847
three books,
and one of them is Hayek's

00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:14.830
Constitution of Liberty,
which you've seen two chapters

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.149
of online.
 

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:21.809
Another is Hernando de Soto's
Mystery of Capital and

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:25.614
the third, and by far most
entertaining,

00:00:25.614 --> 00:00:30.200
is Aravind Adiga's,
The White Tiger.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.396
In today's class we're talking
about something really

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:39.792
foundational,
and it is basically a pragmatic

00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:43.290
or practical theory of freedom.
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.800
It's: Why is freedom a good
thing?

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.740
This is a much less high-flown
theory than many philosophers

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.490
would give.
 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.580
Hayek after all was an
economist.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.112
But it is a powerful one,
and for me it corresponds more

00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:05.420
or less to my convictions.
 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.992
The most powerful aspect of it
is that I can profit from your

00:01:12.992 --> 00:01:18.420
freedom, and you can profit from
my mine.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.470
Freedom is a common good.
 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.408
Individual freedom is a common
good in a way that makes a great

00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:35.101
deal of practical common sense
to a lot of people,

00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:36.730
including me.
 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.052
We'll do it in four chunks;
we'll begin by looking at

00:01:43.052 --> 00:01:45.319
Hayek's framework.
 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:52.235
We will then take up briefly
the question of government and

00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:56.170
how government relates to this.
 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.444
Then we will look at de Soto's
analysis of live and dead

00:02:02.444 --> 00:02:09.516
capital and his explanation of
why undeveloped countries remain

00:02:09.516 --> 00:02:12.938
undeveloped in many cases.
 

00:02:12.938 --> 00:02:19.062
Then finally we'll rub our idea
of freedom up against the lives

00:02:19.062 --> 00:02:24.098
of the central players in The
White Tiger.

00:02:24.098 --> 00:02:34.702
Throughout this I'm going to
advert from time to time to a

00:02:34.702 --> 00:02:37.120
Yale story.
 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.335
Not the tragic one that is on
the front page of today's paper

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:45.524
but an equally--
well no I won't say equally--

00:02:45.524 --> 00:02:49.503
another troubling story,
which is the decision of Yale

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:54.553
University Press when it agreed
to publish a book about the

00:02:54.553 --> 00:02:59.690
Danish cartoons which poked fun
at the prophet Mohammed.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.008
When that book was ready for
printing three months ago the

00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:11.218
director of Yale University
Press called me,

00:03:11.218 --> 00:03:13.979
I'm on his--I'm on the
committee that decides what

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.818
books they publish--
and the question was:

00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:20.020
Can we pull the cartoons out of
the book?

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.960
These are cartoons which make
devout Muslims very mad.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:35.264
And the answer we arrived at,
very reluctantly,

00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:40.500
was: Yes pull the cartoons.
 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.583
And that--think of that
problem, and think of what

00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:54.405
possible explanation could there
be why a great university feels

00:03:54.405 --> 00:04:01.854
itself unwilling to stand up for
freedom of expression in the

00:04:01.854 --> 00:04:08.310
case of these admittedly
blasphemous cartoons.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.908
It turns out the answer is very
practical and I'll give you my

00:04:12.908 --> 00:04:15.699
position on it by the end of
class.

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:27.040
Okay, Hayek was a charming guy
and a very practical thinker;

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.105
less practical perhaps then
economists who work for banks,

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:37.790
but as Nobel laureates go,
very practical.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.639
He was given to thinking about
hard cases;

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.740
about why things were done as
they were.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.069
And he was most of all an
intellectual skeptic.

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:59.180
He was most of all inclined to
doubt human knowledge,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.699
to lean on fallibility and
ignorance,

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:12.939
to look at Marxist historicism,
which we discussed last time,

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.240
as horse feathers.
 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:22.240
He was contemptuous of not Marx
alone,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.004
but of whomsoever imagines that
there is a deterministic course

00:05:28.004 --> 00:05:33.620
for world history (a),
and that they know what is (b);

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.410
neither (a) nor (b) washes with
Hayek.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.879
The reason it doesn't wash is
that he believes in freedom.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.029
And in free societies,
outcomes are unpredictable.

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:57.620
We're going to--read this for a
second for yourselves.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.055
It's the worst sin in the use
of PowerPoint is to put a lot of

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:03.930
words on the screen and than
read them to people.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.819
It makes me furious when I'm in
the audience and people do it.

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.500
So can you read it for
yourselves in the back there?

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.329
We'll parse it a little bit.
 

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:25.300
 
 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.415
"Civilization which no
brain has designed but which has

00:06:28.415 --> 00:06:31.689
grown from the free effort of
millions of individuals."

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:38.990
The idea here is this is a very
powerful idea.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.297
It is, if you say,
"Who designed the world in

00:06:42.297 --> 00:06:44.660
which we live here at
Yale?"

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.300
How long would the list be?
 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.576
Or let's try this,
let's take the highest ranking

00:06:55.576 --> 00:06:59.629
officials of Yale University.
 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:03.526
Let's say Roland Betts who is
the chairman of the Yale

00:07:03.526 --> 00:07:06.598
Corporation,
and Rick Levin who is the

00:07:06.598 --> 00:07:11.045
President of the University,
and let's throw in Linda

00:07:11.045 --> 00:07:16.259
Lorimer, who is the secretary
and Mary Miller who is the Dean

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:19.471
of the College,
and think of four or five

00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:21.470
others that might be important.
 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.290
What percentage of what goes on
around here did they think up?

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:32.839
Take a guess.
 

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:37.899
Do we have a mic out there?
 

00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:39.759
Hand it to the woman right
behind you, let's get her guess.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:44.454
What percentage of the way we
do things at Yale is

00:07:44.454 --> 00:07:49.723
attributable to the five highest
ranking officers at the

00:07:49.723 --> 00:07:51.160
university?
 

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.540
Student:  Five.
 

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.639
Prof: Five percent?
 

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:56.610
You think that much?
 

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.951
Let's pass the mic around to
the--I can tell you've got

00:08:01.951 --> 00:08:05.019
something to say,
go with it.

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:08.129
Student: 
&gt;

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:09.449
Prof: Yeah,
it doesn't seem to be on.

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:14.939
Student:  Can you repeat
the question?

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:20.290
Prof: Okay,
third repetition.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.266
The question is:
Take the five highest ranking

00:08:22.266 --> 00:08:25.124
officers of the university;
take everything that goes on

00:08:25.124 --> 00:08:27.206
around Yale;
what percentage of it can we

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:28.889
attribute to them thinking it
out?

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:31.569
Student:  I'd say less
than one.

00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:34.841
Prof: I'd say way less
than one, and I think they would

00:08:34.841 --> 00:08:36.129
say way less than one.
 

00:08:36.129 --> 00:08:42.322
It's because the university has
been invented a piece at a time

00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:44.419
over the centuries.
 

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:47.470
It's reinvented every day.
 

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:52.669
What you do in the classroom is
part of reinventing Yale,

00:08:52.669 --> 00:08:56.200
what you do elsewhere is part
of it.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.533
And the notion of a free
society that Hayek wants to put

00:09:01.533 --> 00:09:06.575
in front of us is one where
agency, the right to make

00:09:06.575 --> 00:09:09.970
decisions, is widely disbursed.
 

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:15.990
You can imagine societies in
which that isn't true.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.100
In fact, many exist.
 

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.013
One would be an authoritarian
society, an autocracy,

00:09:21.013 --> 00:09:25.080
where a ruling elite pretty
much says what happens.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:30.433
Another would be traditional
society or a theocratic society

00:09:30.433 --> 00:09:36.490
where there are standing rules,
they are more or less followed,

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.418
and they restrict agency in a
sharp way.

00:09:40.418 --> 00:09:48.129
A New Haven colony in the years
1637 to 1665 was a strict

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:54.000
theocracy,
and the rules were laid down in

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.051
the Bible,
solum scripturem [correction:

00:09:57.051 --> 00:09:58.929
sola scriptura]
was the idea.

00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:00.918
They made no laws.
 

00:10:00.918 --> 00:10:04.178
All they did was interpret the
Bible, and enforce it harshly.

00:10:04.178 --> 00:10:10.668
Hayek has in mind something
very different from that,

00:10:10.668 --> 00:10:22.782
and the idea that society is in
some sense a great learning

00:10:22.782 --> 00:10:27.971
machine,
or that a free society is a

00:10:27.971 --> 00:10:34.085
great learning machine,
is the powerful idea in Hayek's

00:10:34.085 --> 00:10:34.750
work.
 

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:40.384
If we think of--you know,
I'm given to these extravagant

00:10:40.384 --> 00:10:43.081
charts--
historical time on this

00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:46.693
dimension measured,
let's say in centuries,

00:10:46.693 --> 00:10:50.320
or in human generations if you
prefer,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.783
and on the vertical axis the
total shared store of knowledge

00:10:53.783 --> 00:10:59.187
that that society accumulates,
knowledge as trivial as how to

00:10:59.187 --> 00:11:05.777
manufacture a toothbrush or as
complex as how to operate a

00:11:05.777 --> 00:11:08.090
great university.
 

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.583
The accumulation of that
knowledge is,

00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:18.535
Hayek says, accelerated
exponentially by disbursed

00:11:18.535 --> 00:11:21.330
agency, by freedom.
 

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:31.394
The rate of accumulation grows
in an exponential curve with a

00:11:31.394 --> 00:11:33.908
free society.
 

00:11:33.908 --> 00:11:38.908
He doesn't talk about
demography, but I would say that

00:11:38.908 --> 00:11:44.567
a free society which has passed
through the world demographic

00:11:44.567 --> 00:11:49.000
transition so that people live
long lives,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.187
lives in which a great deal of
learning can go decade after

00:11:53.187 --> 00:11:55.724
decade,
that such a society,

00:11:55.724 --> 00:12:00.168
embedded in the institutions of
a free society,

00:12:00.168 --> 00:12:06.542
would have the sharpest upward
curve in the accumulation of

00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:08.629
shared knowledge.
 

00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:12.370
The other side of that story,
and here I've added a second

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.014
axis on the right,
which represents the percentage

00:12:16.014 --> 00:12:20.326
of a society's knowledge which
one very competent person can

00:12:20.326 --> 00:12:21.129
capture.
 

00:12:21.129 --> 00:12:24.570
Who's the most competent?
 

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.480
Rick Levin is very competent.
 

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.309
Never brilliant;
always thoroughly competent.

00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:33.039
It's really true.
 

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:35.678
I mean, it really is true.
 

00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:38.519
I mean, part of why he's so
good is he never tries to be

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:39.139
brilliant.
 

00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:42.596
He never--have you ever heard
him anything that was even

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:43.539
vaguely edgy?
 

00:12:43.539 --> 00:12:47.860
I've known him forty years;
we used to ride home together

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.340
at night.
 

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:54.544
He's never anywhere near the
edge but he's never,

00:12:54.544 --> 00:12:57.259
never, never crazy.
 

00:12:57.259 --> 00:13:01.364
He's just--he's the most
thorough--it's the personality

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:04.784
profile for an airline pilot,
a heart surgeon,

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:08.129
and maybe the president of a
university.

00:13:08.129 --> 00:13:15.850
It's a very steady,
very competent persona.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:21.850
And Hayek's big point is that
no individual,

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.980
however competent,
can know any major fraction of

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.490
what--
of the knowledge accumulated in

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.019
a free society over time.
 

00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:33.870
And that, first of all that's
humbling.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.788
It's terrifically humbling.
 

00:13:37.788 --> 00:13:44.134
And part of what the sort of
education all of you are getting

00:13:44.134 --> 00:13:48.470
is about learning what you don't
know,

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.480
and learning where to find out
the things you don't know which

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.110
through time you need to know.
 

00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:02.309
It is not imagined that this or
any other college can create

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:08.826
graduates who master any large
fraction of what is known in the

00:14:08.826 --> 00:14:13.029
United States or the western
world,

00:14:13.029 --> 00:14:14.950
much less the world at large.
 

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:20.272
As knowledge accelerates the
individual fraction of that

00:14:20.272 --> 00:14:24.240
knowledge becomes smaller and
smaller,

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.020
and individuals become more and
more dependent on things

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.889
discovered and known by others.
 

00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:35.570
Take the toothbrush.
 

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.529
Who's got a mic here?
 

00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:42.798
Let's go to the gentleman in
the red t-shirt.

00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:50.918
If it were your assigned task
in your first job to set up a

00:14:50.918 --> 00:14:59.740
manufacturing plant for ordinary
plastic toothbrushes with nylon

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.278
bristles,
how would you go about it?

00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:11.149
Student:  I wouldn't
really have a good idea.

00:15:11.149 --> 00:15:12.519
Probably start looking on
Wikipedia.

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:15.187
Prof: Okay,
that incidentally is where this

00:15:15.187 --> 00:15:16.440
photograph came from.
 

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.610
Okay, so you go to Wikipedia.
 

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:24.440
Do you think Wikipedia's got a
design for a toothbrush factory?

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.865
Student:  No,
maybe Wikihow,

00:15:25.865 --> 00:15:27.746
or--
Prof: Okay,

00:15:27.746 --> 00:15:32.509
what you would begin doing is
reaching out to others.

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:37.808
You would probably have to
reach out to several others,

00:15:37.808 --> 00:15:42.097
and those others--the others
who actually make these

00:15:42.097 --> 00:15:45.421
toothbrushes are--
do you suppose those plants are

00:15:45.421 --> 00:15:46.639
located in New Jersey?
 

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:49.879
Student:  I'm not really
sure.

00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:52.279
Prof: I'm pretty sure.
 

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:56.217
I don't even know this,
but I'd be willing to offer a

00:15:56.217 --> 00:16:00.533
substantial bet that the vast
majority of toothbrushes are

00:16:00.533 --> 00:16:05.230
manufactured somewhere in Asia
or the southern hemisphere;

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.918
probably Asia.
 

00:16:06.918 --> 00:16:11.293
I would also bet that no one in
this--does anyone in this room

00:16:11.293 --> 00:16:14.519
have a clue how you'd go
actually about it?

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:21.408
Injection molded plastic--right?
 

00:16:21.408 --> 00:16:26.360
No one knows,
and yet each of us profits in a

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:32.548
small way from tens and hundreds
of thousands of bits of

00:16:32.548 --> 00:16:35.250
knowledge like that.
 

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:39.538
Let's examine this chart.
 

00:16:39.538 --> 00:16:44.267
Now I think maybe if we work
cooperatively in the room we

00:16:44.267 --> 00:16:46.798
could learn what it's about.
 

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:52.230
I have no idea--I certainly
can't read these labels.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:17:01.000
Anyone here who can read them?
 

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.558
Cool!
 

00:17:01.558 --> 00:17:03.788
Go for it--let's get her a mic
so we don't this.

00:17:03.788 --> 00:17:13.278
Student:  The first one
is wool product,

00:17:13.278 --> 00:17:15.358
the second one is non-wool
product,

00:17:15.358 --> 00:17:17.750
and the third one is original
material,

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.700
the fourth one means food
material,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:25.290
and then the last one means
products that are being exported

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.049
again.
 

00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:27.380
Prof: Okay, re-export.
 

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:37.690
This is a history of British
exports in a complex bar chart,

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.780
and the fact that--are there
other people who knew how to do

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.140
it and didn't raise their hands?
 

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.862
What we see here,
this is kind of a division of

00:17:48.862 --> 00:17:50.298
labor story.
 

00:17:50.298 --> 00:17:53.130
It's a little like Adam Smith
and the pin factory;

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:58.627
that we rely on others as
storehouses of knowledge useful

00:17:58.627 --> 00:18:03.440
to us, or at least imaginably so
in my example.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:10.990
This is the Model T Ford,
and it was produced for the

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:17.236
first time in numbers between
1910 and 1917,

00:18:17.236 --> 00:18:22.900
and it was a revolutionary
machine.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.700
By 1917 it was--when it began
it was selling for about $1,000,

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.318
which would be a lot more than
$1,000 today.

00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:37.540
By 1917 the Ford Motor Company
had figured out how to make this

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:42.858
car and make money on it by
retailing it for $360,

00:18:42.858 --> 00:18:50.865
and they had done that by
combining many small pieces of

00:18:50.865 --> 00:18:58.839
engineering from other fields,
and by using a moving conveyor

00:18:58.839 --> 00:19:01.720
belt,
which carried the car along,

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.548
and workers who stayed in
position,

00:19:04.548 --> 00:19:08.020
each with an assigned task,
each coordinated in a very

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.068
efficient way.
 

00:19:09.068 --> 00:19:16.500
And the larger implication of
that for the American and world

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:23.190
economy, the knowledge embodied
in it, was enormous.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.788
It was wholly unoriginal.
 

00:19:25.788 --> 00:19:28.640
Ford was not a brilliant
engineer.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.318
Some of the people he hired
were damn good engineers.

00:19:31.318 --> 00:19:35.787
By and large though,
they were just regular smart

00:19:35.787 --> 00:19:39.788
people who worked in a
cooperative team way,

00:19:39.788 --> 00:19:43.140
a division of labor about
ideas.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:48.095
There was an older idea called
the American system,

00:19:48.095 --> 00:19:53.250
and the American system was
interchangeable parts.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:59.259
It was parts made so precisely
identical that you could take

00:19:59.259 --> 00:20:05.166
the left front wheel drum off
one Model T and put it on any

00:20:05.166 --> 00:20:09.140
other Model T and expect it to
fit.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.712
And that idea--and that's
actually one of the

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:17.259
revolutionary ideas that's
involved in the vertical spike

00:20:17.259 --> 00:20:21.961
of world affluence,
and which has been disbursed

00:20:21.961 --> 00:20:24.420
everywhere in the globe.
 

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.920
You can't manufacture anything
in a competitive way if you

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.358
don't understand and execute on
interchangeable parts.

00:20:31.358 --> 00:20:37.210
The earliest alleged case was
actually New Haven.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.838
It was the Eli Whitney gun
factory,

00:20:38.838 --> 00:20:42.366
the waterfall on Whitney
Avenue, the little building

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:45.627
there,
Eli Whitney had a contract with

00:20:45.627 --> 00:20:49.630
the federal government to make
10,000 muskets.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.890
He set out to do it with
interchangeable parts,

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:57.318
and what's fascinating is if
you go out there,

00:20:57.318 --> 00:21:00.528
they've got a couple hundred of
these things in the drawers.

00:21:00.528 --> 00:21:03.900
He got most of them just a
little wrong,

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:08.394
so he would file them,
or his workers would file them

00:21:08.394 --> 00:21:12.630
and chivy them,
to make them interchangeable.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.440
But from the point of view of
the military,

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.950
the idea of interchangeability
was huge,

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:21.440
because when one part of a
weapon jammed,

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:26.368
you could take another one and
interchange it,

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:29.976
and the efficiency of the
logistics were enormously

00:21:29.976 --> 00:21:30.769
improved.
 

00:21:30.769 --> 00:21:34.190
The military is not mainly what
that idea is about.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:39.160
Anybody have a clue who this is?
 

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.098
Fair enough;
there's no reason you should.

00:21:44.098 --> 00:21:50.490
This is the guy,
Norman Borlaug,

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:56.346
correct,
who did the critical work on

00:21:56.346 --> 00:22:00.550
developing high growth,
high productivity,

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.295
and disease resistant seeds--
most of the work done fifty or

00:22:04.295 --> 00:22:07.910
sixty years ago,
he died last week--which

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:12.650
increased agricultural yields on
a world basis.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:18.578
There is still hunger in the
world but it's all manmade.

00:22:18.578 --> 00:22:23.039
That is, there are no cases in
the world now where there isn't

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:25.380
enough food to feed everybody.
 

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.098
There's always enough food.
 

00:22:28.098 --> 00:22:32.180
If it doesn't get to the right
places that's something to do

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.670
with human agency or
institutions.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:39.971
And all of us benefit from that
work, and that work in turn

00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:45.089
benefitted from generation after
generation of botany and

00:22:45.089 --> 00:22:46.368
husbandry.
 

00:22:46.368 --> 00:22:52.826
All this process of building
the social store of knowledge is

00:22:52.826 --> 00:22:57.130
what Hayek's idea of freedom is
about.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:02.356
This is Dean Mary Miller,
and by now I've beaten this

00:23:02.356 --> 00:23:08.490
horse to death--she's wonderful,
she's absolutely terrific.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:14.209
What fraction of the curriculum
she supervises would she need to

00:23:14.209 --> 00:23:16.660
have direct knowledge of?
 

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.528
Do you think she knows what we
do in here?

00:23:20.528 --> 00:23:25.430
She would only know if I were
in a lot of trouble,

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:26.828
or you were.
 

00:23:26.828 --> 00:23:32.358
There are hundreds of courses,
even thousands,

00:23:32.358 --> 00:23:38.690
and the dispersion of agency,
the--last summer I sat at my

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:45.798
summer house in Northern Vermont
with a stack of books about that

00:23:45.798 --> 00:23:48.095
high,
picking the books for this

00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:48.460
course.
 

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:52.660
She didn't supervise that;
neither would I have been

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.578
pleased if she had.
 

00:23:54.578 --> 00:23:59.170
But the effect,
if she has the right people

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:04.150
doing it and trusts them,
is very like Adam Smith's pin

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:08.190
factory and the division of
labor and the power it produces.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:13.076
So we're back to Smith;
Smith had the idea that by

00:24:13.076 --> 00:24:18.181
dividing labor so that one
person doesn't undertake the

00:24:18.181 --> 00:24:22.528
whole complex task of
manufacturing a pin,

00:24:22.528 --> 00:24:26.531
if you divide the labor among
many who get good at specific

00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:29.785
aspects of the task,
you can make it cheaper and

00:24:29.785 --> 00:24:32.868
more efficient then otherwise it
would have been.

00:24:32.868 --> 00:24:35.910
Hayek's idea is more loosely
jointed than that.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:41.970
Hayek's idea is that you don't
even assign roles to people;

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:43.818
you let them find their own
roles.

00:24:43.818 --> 00:24:50.557
That if you want to go out and
start a toothbrush factory using

00:24:50.557 --> 00:24:55.497
a novel technology,
invented late at night over

00:24:55.497 --> 00:25:01.108
beer with your roommate,
what's the likely outcome?

00:25:01.108 --> 00:25:06.180
The likely outcome is that you
will fail.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.170
Your toothbrush will be too
expensive and not very good.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.599
Right?
 

00:25:11.599 --> 00:25:13.140
Isn't that the likely thing?
 

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:18.847
If you think about a market
economy as literally hundreds of

00:25:18.847 --> 00:25:23.880
thousands of people who make
decisions like that--

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.308
go/ no go--with a new model
toothbrush,

00:25:27.308 --> 00:25:34.380
the accumulated knowledge from
that is enormously powerful.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:40.048
If you begin to make money with
your new model toothbrush,

00:25:40.048 --> 00:25:43.828
then a couple of things will
happen.

00:25:43.828 --> 00:25:47.170
One, capital will flow toward
you.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.119
People will say,
we would like to own part of

00:25:50.119 --> 00:25:50.588
this.
 

00:25:50.588 --> 00:25:54.407
And our subject next Monday is
the joint stock corporation,

00:25:54.407 --> 00:25:56.118
which is all about that.
 

00:25:56.118 --> 00:26:02.740
And capital will flow toward
you, and so will competition.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:08.211
As soon as you begin to succeed
people will attempt to get as

00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:13.045
close to your product as the
patent and copyright laws

00:26:13.045 --> 00:26:16.712
permit,
and to compete with you on the

00:26:16.712 --> 00:26:19.028
basis of quality or price.
 

00:26:19.028 --> 00:26:22.551
And that process,
you can think of it is as

00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:27.009
enormous diversified portfolio;
the whole economy.

00:26:27.009 --> 00:26:30.001
No one directs the whole
economy or says where the

00:26:30.001 --> 00:26:32.689
capital goes,
though sometimes it feels as if

00:26:32.689 --> 00:26:35.009
Goldman Sachs comes close to
that.

00:26:35.009 --> 00:26:44.490
The decision process is highly
decentralized and un-programmed.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.276
Indeed, Hayek,
if you'll look closely,

00:26:48.276 --> 00:26:54.622
says that what we're trying to
do is create the opportunity for

00:26:54.622 --> 00:26:57.588
the unexpected to happen.
 

00:26:57.588 --> 00:27:02.776
"Liberty is essential in
order to leave room for the

00:27:02.776 --> 00:27:05.740
unforeseeable and unpredicted.
 

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.846
We want it because we have
learned to expect from it the

00:27:08.846 --> 00:27:11.670
opportunity of realizing many of
our aims."

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:22.380
The core idea is disbursed
power of action.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:29.064
Now Hayek is entirely dependent
on the idea that we are of

00:27:29.064 --> 00:27:31.410
limited intellect.
 

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:36.373
If we were, as this quote says,
omniscient, page 29,

00:27:36.373 --> 00:27:41.336
the green quote here,
there would not be so strong a

00:27:41.336 --> 00:27:43.380
case for freedom.
 

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.920
I think there would be other
cases,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:49.904
but the core case that Hayek is
making is that freedom is a way

00:27:49.904 --> 00:27:52.880
of overcoming our own
fallibility,

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:58.673
and of allowing others to fill
the holes in our individual

00:27:58.673 --> 00:28:00.910
stores of knowledge.
 

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:06.762
Now Hayek, early in the section
you read, focuses on the

00:28:06.762 --> 00:28:09.848
question of a rock climber.
 

00:28:09.848 --> 00:28:21.336
It's kind of a jarring
reference when you see it,

00:28:21.336 --> 00:28:27.558
it's around page twelve.
 

00:28:27.558 --> 00:28:31.221
I read, "Most people will
still have enough feeling for

00:28:31.221 --> 00:28:35.068
the original meaning of the word
free to see that if"--

00:28:35.068 --> 00:28:40.218
no, sorry--"In this sense
freedom refers solely to the

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:43.680
relation of men to other
men,"--

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.556
or persons to other persons,
"The only infringement of

00:28:47.556 --> 00:28:49.160
it is coercion by men.
 

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.087
This means, in particular that
the range of physical

00:28:52.087 --> 00:28:55.188
possibilities from which a
person can choose at a given

00:28:55.188 --> 00:28:57.828
moment has no direct relevance
to freedom.

00:28:57.828 --> 00:29:02.049
The rock climber on a difficult
pitch who sees only one way out

00:29:02.049 --> 00:29:04.910
to save his life is
unquestionably free.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.666
Most people will still have
enough feeling for the original

00:29:08.666 --> 00:29:12.554
meaning of the word free to see
that if the same rock climber

00:29:12.554 --> 00:29:16.634
were to fall into a crevasse and
were unable to get out he would

00:29:16.634 --> 00:29:19.680
only figuratively be called
unfree."

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.940
Now that's a big--a lot rides
on that claim.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:30.009
Hayek defends it unevenly.
 

00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:32.970
If you look closely at the way
he defines coercion,

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:38.817
you'll find that the rock
climber story is the clear and

00:29:38.817 --> 00:29:42.011
easy case,
and by the end of our slides

00:29:42.011 --> 00:29:44.545
today,
we'll begin to look at some

00:29:44.545 --> 00:29:49.097
harder cases and some of those
hard cases are raised by The

00:29:49.097 --> 00:29:50.890
White Tiger book.
 

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:55.390
Now this is more my kind of
rock climber,

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.640
hanging on barely.
 

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.809
I'm terrified of any height
greater than five feet.

00:30:01.809 --> 00:30:07.319
What's behind this story?
 

00:30:07.319 --> 00:30:11.180
What--Hayek isn't sneaky here.
 

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:14.048
Anybody want to tell us why he
makes this argument?

00:30:14.048 --> 00:30:22.645
Because he is arguing in an
environment where Communism is a

00:30:22.645 --> 00:30:29.000
very live option,
and the Marxist position about

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.048
freedom is that it's a Bourgeois
delusion,

00:30:34.048 --> 00:30:41.298
and that only by giving
everyone the same access to

00:30:41.298 --> 00:30:48.670
material rewards,
to money, wealth, and the like;

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:52.174
only by downward redistribution
of money, wealth,

00:30:52.174 --> 00:30:56.118
and the like can real freedom
be shared by everyone.

00:30:56.118 --> 00:31:01.058
Hayek wants desperately to head
off that argument.

00:31:01.058 --> 00:31:06.857
Now, whether that argument is
right or wrong is actually more

00:31:06.857 --> 00:31:12.559
semantic than anything else,
and we'll actually close with a

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:14.588
slide about this.
 

00:31:14.588 --> 00:31:18.553
That is to say,
can you be free and at the

00:31:18.553 --> 00:31:23.000
bottom of society,
unable to do many things?

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.430
Unable to effectively exercise
your freedom;

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:33.086
one view is that the two
dimensions, freedom and wealth

00:31:33.086 --> 00:31:36.190
or power are entirely
independent.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:41.828
Another view is that without
some degree of market power,

00:31:41.828 --> 00:31:46.549
some degree of ability to
interest others in your needs

00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:51.708
through exchanging your skills
and your labor for what it is

00:31:51.708 --> 00:31:55.596
that you need,
or for the money which will buy

00:31:55.596 --> 00:31:58.038
what it is that you need or
want;

00:31:58.038 --> 00:32:03.521
only with some degree of market
power can freedom be fully

00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:04.579
realized.
 

00:32:04.579 --> 00:32:06.150
And I'm of that second view.
 

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:12.068
I am of the view that the wide
dispersion of relative affluence

00:32:12.068 --> 00:32:15.220
is part of making freedom real.
 

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:20.069
The way I would argue that with
Hayek is that,

00:32:20.069 --> 00:32:24.273
conceptually,
the concept of coercion is

00:32:24.273 --> 00:32:27.400
extraordinarily slippery.
 

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.348
Let's consider the guy in the
crevasse.

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:35.092
He's stuck, but you and I are
walking by on our way to a

00:32:35.092 --> 00:32:40.006
picnic, and he calls to us,
and we say sorry we're late to

00:32:40.006 --> 00:32:41.298
the picnic.
 

00:32:41.298 --> 00:32:46.893
It would be not--you wouldn't
have too much twist the language

00:32:46.893 --> 00:32:52.670
to say that that was an implicit
act of coercion on our part.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:57.558
Then the slope gets dangerous
and complex.

00:32:57.558 --> 00:33:02.417
If he had diabetes,
and we withheld from him the

00:33:02.417 --> 00:33:08.308
treatment for diabetes,
would that violate his freedom?

00:33:08.308 --> 00:33:13.020
All I want you to do--what I
really want you to do is get the

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:17.732
power of Hayek's idea in your
heads and get the complexity of

00:33:17.732 --> 00:33:20.088
applying it in your heads.
 

00:33:20.088 --> 00:33:23.349
Now the reason I think some
degree of affluence,

00:33:23.349 --> 00:33:26.817
or some degree of market power
is part of the deal,

00:33:26.817 --> 00:33:30.009
is that Hayek's examples all
depend on it.

00:33:30.009 --> 00:33:35.580
The things which he tells us
about in the second chapter are

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:40.019
all ones where people have
enough education,

00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:43.670
enough physical health,
and enough skills,

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.538
that they can be real players.
 

00:33:46.538 --> 00:33:56.928
Now the Adiga questions--and
this is Adiga's social class

00:33:56.928 --> 00:34:05.088
we're seeing in this slide--are
different.

00:34:05.088 --> 00:34:09.503
We're going to go to Adiga in a
few minutes, but let's pause and

00:34:09.503 --> 00:34:13.568
talk about the Danish cartoons,
which I'm not going to show

00:34:13.568 --> 00:34:14.130
you.
 

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.556
You can see them,
all you have to do is Google

00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:18.090
them.
 

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:22.632
And they are,
from an Islamic point of view,

00:34:22.632 --> 00:34:25.273
blasphemous,
and they are,

00:34:25.273 --> 00:34:31.402
from a western secular point of
view, they are in some ways

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:32.670
funny.
 

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:37.086
This cartoon,
which is a cartoon about

00:34:37.086 --> 00:34:41.358
cartoons,
captures the idea that the

00:34:41.358 --> 00:34:48.344
scriptural blasphemy seen by the
Muslim here is on the same plain

00:34:48.344 --> 00:34:55.550
with the secular blasphemy seen
by the advocate of free speech.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.614
John Bolton,
he's a Yale alum,

00:34:57.614 --> 00:35:03.967
I even know him a little,
he was Bush's representative to

00:35:03.967 --> 00:35:09.590
the UN and he's a radical
libertarian,

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:13.675
and he's on the warpath against
Yale over our not publishing the

00:35:13.675 --> 00:35:14.389
cartoons.
 

00:35:14.389 --> 00:35:17.429
Let's stop and talk practice
for a minute.

00:35:17.429 --> 00:35:25.231
Have we got--pick somebody
out--can you imagine any

00:35:25.231 --> 00:35:32.409
circumstance--the few,
the proud, the moose.

00:35:32.409 --> 00:35:36.594
I like it!--can you imagine any
circumstance under which you

00:35:36.594 --> 00:35:40.565
would say that we should tell
the University Press not to

00:35:40.565 --> 00:35:43.190
publish the cartoons in the
book?

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.139
The book will be out in about a
week but without the cartoons.

00:35:46.139 --> 00:35:50.088
Student:  I can imagine
this is a pretty strong case for

00:35:50.088 --> 00:35:52.376
doing that,
given that there were good

00:35:52.376 --> 00:35:55.329
reason to believe that
publishing the cartoons would--

00:35:55.329 --> 00:36:00.163
there was some specific threat
that publishing the cartoons

00:36:00.163 --> 00:36:05.079
would result in harm to the
university or to people here.

00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:07.014
Prof: Okay,
you cut straight to the chase,

00:36:07.014 --> 00:36:07.699
very well done.
 

00:36:07.699 --> 00:36:15.039
The point just made is that the
university consulted experts,

00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:20.025
and the question to the experts
was: "What's the

00:36:20.025 --> 00:36:25.490
probability of a terrorist
attack launched against Yale in

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:30.670
response to the publication of
the cartoons?"

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:37.019
The answer came back that it
was not insubstantial.

00:36:37.019 --> 00:36:41.780
Now why would that be?
 

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:48.429
Would you--you got to grab it
and talk to it--

00:36:48.429 --> 00:36:54.744
would you be inclined to take
the libertarian position and

00:36:54.744 --> 00:36:56.813
say,
"Yale is the kind of place

00:36:56.813 --> 00:36:58.860
which stands up for freedom of
expression?"

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.608
Student:  I think you
could make the case Yale stands

00:37:02.608 --> 00:37:05.532
up for freedom of expression in
a lot of cases,

00:37:05.532 --> 00:37:06.550
but not all.
 

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:12.655
Prof: Okay let's
see--have we got a true gospel

00:37:12.655 --> 00:37:15.650
libertarian in the room?
 

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:19.289
We got somebody who wants to
say, "Dammit!

00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:20.500
You should have published
them."

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.429
I don't mind being criticized.
 

00:37:23.429 --> 00:37:29.722
Yeah--yes we need to--if you'll
come forward a little it's going

00:37:29.722 --> 00:37:31.719
to make it easier.
 

00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:35.298
Student:  I would say
yes, I see the cartoons no

00:37:35.298 --> 00:37:39.277
differently than I see all of
those Darwin cartoons that were

00:37:39.277 --> 00:37:43.121
around for Darwin day or the
pictures of the Christian fish

00:37:43.121 --> 00:37:45.840
with feet on it walking on to
land.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.039
I mean, if you can criticize
one religion then you have to be

00:37:48.039 --> 00:37:48.920
able to criticize all.
 

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.318
I think that the best approach
would have been probably to try

00:37:52.318 --> 00:37:55.329
to create an academic exchange
whereby every University

00:37:55.329 --> 00:37:58.672
displayed the cartoons in some
public place because I believe

00:37:58.672 --> 00:38:01.460
that freedom of speech is
absolutely sacred.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.579
Prof: You're the kind of
guy Rick Levin's scared of.

00:38:04.579 --> 00:38:07.610
Thanks that was good.
 

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:14.655
The--Richard--
Student:  I don't need

00:38:14.655 --> 00:38:15.300
the microphone.
 

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.141
If the argument is that the
right to life is going to

00:38:18.141 --> 00:38:20.710
outweigh the right to freedom of
expression,

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:25.278
a cartoon like this would in
fact raise the probable chance

00:38:25.278 --> 00:38:27.170
of a terrorism attack.
 

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:30.739
Bolton's counterargument would
be that it's a slippery slope.

00:38:30.739 --> 00:38:36.034
The minute you give into this
sort of appeasement towards that

00:38:36.034 --> 00:38:39.831
potential threat,
down the road the potential

00:38:39.831 --> 00:38:44.721
that you're giving up a multiple
or a societal amount of freedoms

00:38:44.721 --> 00:38:48.219
to appease an aggressor,
you only gradually bring an

00:38:48.219 --> 00:38:50.739
even greater existentialist
right to free speech.

00:38:50.739 --> 00:38:54.313
Prof: I agree that that
would be one of the counters,

00:38:54.313 --> 00:38:57.039
and it is a persuasive one,
it's important.

00:38:57.039 --> 00:39:03.748
The issue here gets to be--it
comes down in my view,

00:39:03.748 --> 00:39:10.719
to the effective ability to
defend the institution.

00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:14.659
When I say defend,
it I mean defend it.

00:39:14.659 --> 00:39:18.927
The next topic for us,
if I've got the slides

00:39:18.927 --> 00:39:22.795
organized right,
is the nation's state system,

00:39:22.795 --> 00:39:26.710
and what we have here is a
question of narrow gauge state

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:27.480
failure.
 

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.530
The guy pictured is Thomas
Hobbes,

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:33.719
his great book The
Leviathan,

00:39:33.719 --> 00:39:38.873
came out at the same time as
the settlement to the Thirty

00:39:38.873 --> 00:39:42.054
Years War,
more or less and they were two

00:39:42.054 --> 00:39:43.710
faces of the same thing.
 

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:50.018
Hobbes' central idea of the
leviathan was a power so great,

00:39:50.018 --> 00:39:55.760
and so well disciplined,
that it could monopolize force

00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:01.458
and violence in society,
and keep people from attacking

00:40:01.458 --> 00:40:05.137
one another,
and put down a general set of

00:40:05.137 --> 00:40:09.688
rules of law which allowed
people to know what was coming

00:40:09.688 --> 00:40:10.340
next.
 

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:16.797
If the leviathan were fully
effective, I would favor

00:40:16.797 --> 00:40:20.090
publishing the cartoons.
 

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:26.273
My reasoning would be similar
to the reasoning back left,

00:40:26.273 --> 00:40:32.679
that freedom is freedom,
and freedom includes bad taste.

00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:36.639
I think blasphemy is very bad
taste toward any religion.

00:40:36.639 --> 00:40:40.065
It's bad taste,
but the fact that I deem it bad

00:40:40.065 --> 00:40:42.969
taste doesn't make it
inappropriate,

00:40:42.969 --> 00:40:46.304
and inappropriate exercise of
freedom for those who take a

00:40:46.304 --> 00:40:47.300
different view.
 

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.909
That's the whole idea of
freedom.

00:40:48.909 --> 00:41:00.668
Now what's missing here is that
in some fundamental way the Al

00:41:00.668 --> 00:41:04.909
Qaeda events worked.
 

00:41:04.909 --> 00:41:09.250
They did in some degree work.
 

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.239
We all pay rent on them every
time we fly.

00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:18.891
I mean, think about the person
hours consumed taking shoes on

00:41:18.891 --> 00:41:25.322
and off, and the perfectly good
bottles of water or shaving

00:41:25.322 --> 00:41:28.869
cream which are confiscated.
 

00:41:28.869 --> 00:41:34.643
The critical aspects of state
performance: The rule of law

00:41:34.643 --> 00:41:37.809
reliably enforced,
zones of freedom,

00:41:37.809 --> 00:41:40.442
for example,
within our property here at the

00:41:40.442 --> 00:41:43.260
university,
corruption minimized,

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:47.789
and the monopoly on force and
violence effective.

00:41:47.789 --> 00:41:54.793
Now what 9/11 was about was an
attack on our culture and a

00:41:54.793 --> 00:42:02.289
demonstration that even the
mightiest nation in the world,

00:42:02.289 --> 00:42:07.340
nay the mightiest nation in the
history of the world,

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:14.157
was open to violent attack,
especially if you were willing

00:42:14.157 --> 00:42:17.030
to die in the process.
 

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:22.309
And we have been convinced by
that.

00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:30.802
If you actually think about
defending the Yale campus

00:42:30.802 --> 00:42:35.592
against--
just imagine a single person

00:42:35.592 --> 00:42:42.327
willing to die or spend his life
in prison for attacking Yale in

00:42:42.327 --> 00:42:46.389
the most spectacular possible
way,

00:42:46.389 --> 00:42:50.090
what would we have to do to the
campus to rule that out?

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.409
Call the New Haven police
department?

00:42:52.409 --> 00:42:55.650
You must be kidding.
 

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:59.154
I mean, they don't have
anything like the resources to

00:42:59.154 --> 00:43:03.320
do it, and our own police force
doesn't come close to being able

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.179
to do it.
 

00:43:04.179 --> 00:43:08.853
The campus is built on the
premise that the monopoly on

00:43:08.853 --> 00:43:11.190
force and violence works.
 

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:15.213
It is built to deal with petty
criminals, the locking gates and

00:43:15.213 --> 00:43:18.199
that kind of thing,
but the locking of gates is

00:43:18.199 --> 00:43:20.860
entirely useless against a
terrorist.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:25.719
I soberly thought about this
and I thought I would much

00:43:25.719 --> 00:43:30.849
rather take the ringing first
amendment point of view,

00:43:30.849 --> 00:43:34.969
and I was only one of many
people involved in this

00:43:34.969 --> 00:43:39.873
judgment,
but ultimately I couldn't bring

00:43:39.873 --> 00:43:46.780
myself to undertake that risk on
behalf of all of you.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:52.822
Richard Pestelli is correct
that that represents a loss of

00:43:52.822 --> 00:43:57.380
something and a step on a
slippery slope.

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.309
I think that's really true,
but it's real.

00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:07.192
The virtue of Hayek's way of
thinking is that it's not all or

00:44:07.192 --> 00:44:08.340
nothing.
 

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:13.010
It is a pragmatic judgment
about how best to organize

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.909
society.
 

00:44:13.909 --> 00:44:17.748
Now Hernando de Soto,
third topic,

00:44:17.748 --> 00:44:25.079
The Mystery of Capital,
it's a middle difficulty book.

00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:27.117
It's not very difficult,
and it's all built on one

00:44:27.117 --> 00:44:27.449
point.
 

00:44:27.449 --> 00:44:32.206
The one point is the
distinction between formal and

00:44:32.206 --> 00:44:34.110
informal property.
 

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:38.311
The photo I showed you before
is a favela,

00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:42.949
near Rio in Brazil,
and it's all informal property.

00:44:42.949 --> 00:44:46.670
The people who built those
houses don't really own them.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:49.777
They own them according to a
set of informal rules that

00:44:49.777 --> 00:44:52.539
operate among the people in the
favela.

00:44:52.539 --> 00:44:58.025
They don't have formal
documentation for them,

00:44:58.025 --> 00:45:01.559
so it is informal property.
 

00:45:01.559 --> 00:45:07.458
Every building in New Haven is
formal property,

00:45:07.458 --> 00:45:13.230
even community gardens are
formal property.

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:15.918
There is a deed written down,
you can trace it,

00:45:15.918 --> 00:45:17.789
and you can show it to a bank.
 

00:45:17.789 --> 00:45:29.971
de Soto's major idea is that
informal property is dead

00:45:29.971 --> 00:45:35.483
capital,
and formal property where the

00:45:35.483 --> 00:45:42.170
power of the state stands behind
your ownership is live capital.

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:48.873
His claim is that poor people
in developing societies own a

00:45:48.873 --> 00:45:53.960
vast amount of capital in
informal forms,

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:58.869
and that, just as capital is
formed in advanced market

00:45:58.869 --> 00:46:03.871
societies by combining many
small assets into a smaller

00:46:03.871 --> 00:46:09.545
number of big assets,
so too can capital be formed in

00:46:09.545 --> 00:46:15.864
poor countries by formalizing
property and allowing people to

00:46:15.864 --> 00:46:22.184
make investments by taking on
debt which is secured by formal

00:46:22.184 --> 00:46:23.659
property.
 

00:46:23.659 --> 00:46:28.762
His further claim is that many
of the worst economies in the

00:46:28.762 --> 00:46:34.213
world are the worst economies in
the world because the number of

00:46:34.213 --> 00:46:37.300
hurdles to form--
that stand in front of you when

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.860
you want to formalize your
property--

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.989
are wildly excessive.
 

00:46:40.989 --> 00:46:45.936
I'm going to do The White
Tiger at the beginning of

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:47.500
class next time.
 

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:52.199
I urge you--one of you came up
to me at lunch today and said,

00:46:52.199 --> 00:46:54.550
"Wow this is fun!"
 

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:59.664
It is one of the great novels
of this era, and I promise you,

00:46:59.664 --> 00:47:04.610
if you'll just give it an hour,
you're going to love it.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:08.231
We'll start with The White
Tiger on Monday and then

00:47:08.231 --> 00:47:10.900
we'll go to the joint stock
corporation.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:16.690
The reading for Monday is on
the web now in Classes V2.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.840
It's the Alfred Chandler piece
about railroads.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.436
You will need to go to RIS when
we get to the Harvard cases,

00:47:21.436 --> 00:47:23.088
there are three Harvard cases,
we're going to give you all the

00:47:23.088 --> 00:47:24.684
Yale cases because we're nice
people but Harvard is going to

00:47:24.684 --> 00:47:26.389
insist on selling them to you so
you've got to go to RIS and buy

00:47:26.389 --> 00:47:27.500
a little packet of Harvard
cases.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:33.000

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.005
Okay so the object today is to
wrap our arms around,

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:11.860
not all but a good portion,
of the material covered.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.079
The book called,
Bottom Billion,

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:19.569
is somewhat neglected in
today's discussion but should

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:22.620
not be neglected in your essays.
 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:30.868
Indeed, your essays will need
to take account of many of the

00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:36.880
things said by Paul Collier in
that book.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.365
First of all,
our topic slide here,

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:46.209
you have to ask yourself first
what this guy believes that

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:49.900
umbrella is going to do for him.
 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.131
It's--and I'll show you the
subsequent slide in the

00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:57.940
appropriate place about what
happens next,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.951
but the gist of that slide is
that capitalism is a dynamic

00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:10.280
system which is always leaning
forward and is always within a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.709
few months of leaning too far
forward.

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:28.280
It is the nature of the system.
 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.900
Okay I'm going to begin by
revisiting the fundamentals,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.040
these systems of ideas that we
began the term with,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.750
and then we'll look at some of
those system in greater detail.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.220
Thomas Malthus,
Essay on Population,

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.430
the thesis is that nearly
universal poverty is inevitable,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.920
because wherever productivity
increases,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.808
population increases apace,
and the resources used for

00:02:08.808 --> 00:02:15.143
production have diminishing
returns as you invest more and

00:02:15.143 --> 00:02:16.810
more labor.
 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.814
Malthus is obviously thinking
about farming,

00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:26.937
and farming in a small island
called England,

00:02:26.937 --> 00:02:29.150
and he's wrong.
 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.492
The world demographic
transition utterly contradicts

00:02:34.492 --> 00:02:39.079
his theory,
and the fact that birth rates

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:45.532
and death rates might fall in
the precipitous way they did is

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:52.092
the world demographic transition
and is a major key to why the

00:02:52.092 --> 00:02:56.610
world economy works the way it
does,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.086
because it produces an enormous
surplus of labor in the

00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:06.060
societies which pass through it
later rather than earlier.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.936
Similarly, if we look at Hans
Rosling's wonderful data

00:03:10.936 --> 00:03:16.640
animation which we used on the
first day of class relating life

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.199
expectancy to GDP per capita,
the world in the last 120 years

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:28.400
has grown richer on average five
or six fold,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.128
500% or 600%,
richer and healthier,

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:38.360
longer lived so that there is a
human project,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.567
a world human project in which
the best of capitalism

00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:47.490
participates,
and I think that's the

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.758
important upside to the topic.
 

00:03:50.758 --> 00:03:57.949
Adam Smith, "invisible
hand," and Smith has become

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:04.409
in death a more famous figure
than he was in life,

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.090
and a simpler figure.
 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.871
The number of people who have
actually read Wealth of

00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:14.860
Nations or read it and
Theory of Moral Sentiment

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.192
is a tiny fraction of the people
who claim to organize all their

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:24.564
thinking around Adam Smith,
and Adam Smith's invisible hand

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:29.165
is a fragile thing which
operates not with giant

00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:32.384
corporations,
not with oligopolies,

00:04:32.384 --> 00:04:36.829
not with monopsonies,
it operates under conditions of

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:40.100
perfect or near perfect
competition.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.379
And the Porter Forces which we
have seen,

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:48.120
direct competition,
the threat of new competition,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.589
the threat of people moving to
substitute products,

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:55.550
the power of suppliers and the
power of buyers to bargain,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.269
all five of those factors work
against the invisible hand.

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:07.742
The whole point of the Porter
Forces is how business

00:05:07.742 --> 00:05:14.088
corporations avoid being
compelled to behave in the

00:05:14.088 --> 00:05:21.449
Smithian way of producing goods
and selling them at or near

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.750
their marginal cost.
 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:32.134
Carl Marx and Joseph Schumpeter;
two great economists,

00:05:32.134 --> 00:05:35.608
two great thinkers,
Marx the founder of a

00:05:35.608 --> 00:05:39.833
revolutionary movement,
Schumpeter a banker,

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:47.240
a Harvard professor,
a brilliant intellect;

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.199
two ways of looking at the same
thing.

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.593
What these two guys agree on is
that capitalism is an inherently

00:05:56.593 --> 00:05:59.420
unstable forward-moving system.
 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.927
That the one thing of which
capitalism is incapable is

00:06:03.927 --> 00:06:07.672
standing still,
that like the bicyclist in my

00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:11.675
title slide,
capitalism always leans forward

00:06:11.675 --> 00:06:16.788
and always relies on events in
the future which are not

00:06:16.788 --> 00:06:18.209
predictable.
 

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:22.329
Now where the two part ways is
that Marx is a determinist;

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:27.069
Marx really thinks that he can
foretell the history of

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.110
capitalism in its main outlines.
 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.310
And he was mistaken;
of that we can be sure.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.800
Schumpeter, on the other hand,
believed that the future of

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.029
capitalism is inherently
indeterminate.

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:49.077
That there is much random
process, so much opportunity for

00:06:49.077 --> 00:06:53.266
unexpected innovation,
that the prediction of

00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:56.620
capital--the behavior of
capitalist economies,

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.420
beyond the very short term,
is impossible,

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.041
and I'm inclined to believe
that Schumpeter's right about

00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:06.620
that.
 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.509
Hayek.
 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:12.769
Hayek is the guy who wrote
Constitution of Liberty,

00:07:12.769 --> 00:07:15.060
and it's possible to be very
critical of Hayek,

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.449
who does play some logical
tricks with his reader.

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:22.963
On the other hand,
he puts forward a passionate

00:07:22.963 --> 00:07:28.850
vision about the creative
possibilities of a free society.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.281
A society in which the right to
innovate the right to choose,

00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:37.711
the right to author ones own
life and propose scripts for the

00:07:37.711 --> 00:07:43.093
lives of others;
a society which is open and not

00:07:43.093 --> 00:07:50.778
subject to overbearing hierarchy
and bureaucracy is a learning

00:07:50.778 --> 00:07:56.019
machine,
and Hayek is a brilliant

00:07:56.019 --> 00:08:01.459
theorist of that learning
machine.

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:05.889
Another set of fundamentals,
this is Ronald Coase,

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:08.329
he of Coase theorem fame.
 

00:08:08.329 --> 00:08:11.600
This is Hernando de Soto,
he of Mystery of

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.982
Capitalism fame,
and what they both say is that

00:08:16.982 --> 00:08:23.470
capital formation relies on
governments and courts,

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.199
and the formalization of
property rights,

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:31.824
and that one of the
foundational aspects of our

00:08:31.824 --> 00:08:38.058
wealth in the western world is
tradable property rights so that

00:08:38.058 --> 00:08:43.490
our houses are also small
storehouses of capital,

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:49.238
and our earning power can be
the collateral for debt which is

00:08:49.238 --> 00:08:52.399
repaid through future earnings.
 

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:56.868
That whole aspect of
capitalism, that whole metabolic

00:08:56.868 --> 00:09:02.538
process is at the fundaments of
the best aspects of capitalism,

00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:07.200
the aspects that involve
sustained prosperity.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.738
Okay with the remaining forty
minutes of our class,

00:09:11.738 --> 00:09:16.820
I'm going to go through these
topics, you can just take a

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.090
quick glance at them.
 

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:27.149
They are basically the details
of what I've just adumbrated,

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:33.980
and the last of them is the
case for your final.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:43.812
Okay capital,
capital is accumulated wealth

00:09:43.812 --> 00:09:49.899
reproductively deployed.
 

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:53.120
It can take the form of
cultivated land,

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.605
it can take the form of seed
corn, it can take the form of

00:09:57.605 --> 00:10:02.376
factory machinery,
it can take the form of stock

00:10:02.376 --> 00:10:07.089
certificates,
it can take the form of

00:10:07.089 --> 00:10:11.746
educated people;
indeed, in a very real sense

00:10:11.746 --> 00:10:16.313
you are in the process of
capital formation during your

00:10:16.313 --> 00:10:19.019
years as university students.
 

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:23.090
You will be an embodiment of
capital,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.611
and indeed, capital of a high
order when you finish Yale

00:10:27.611 --> 00:10:30.820
College or the School of
Management,

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:35.332
or the law school,
or whatever may be your last

00:10:35.332 --> 00:10:36.019
stop.
 

00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:41.398
Capitalism, on the other hand,
is the name that socialists

00:10:41.398 --> 00:10:46.210
gave to a whole bunch of things
they didn't like.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:51.668
Private businesses that,
in their view,

00:10:51.668 --> 00:10:54.998
exploited labor,
in their view despoiled the

00:10:54.998 --> 00:10:58.779
environment,
in their view desanctified

00:10:58.779 --> 00:11:02.509
historical and religious
tradition,

00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:05.808
and there is no inventor of
capitalism.

00:11:05.808 --> 00:11:09.971
Adam Smith didn't use the term,
Adam Smith didn't even like

00:11:09.971 --> 00:11:13.517
joint stock corporations;
he thought they generally

00:11:13.517 --> 00:11:17.727
didn't work well,
but it is an organic system,

00:11:17.727 --> 00:11:23.903
which develops over time,
and as Hayek and Schumpeter and

00:11:23.903 --> 00:11:29.679
others point out to us,
is capable of self-modification

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:31.090
through time.
 

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.860
Marx's historicist theory of
this,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.210
and we did a whole lecture on
this in September,

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.714
with the idea that capitalism
always turns toward monopolies

00:11:43.714 --> 00:11:46.538
that capital becomes too
abundant,

00:11:46.538 --> 00:11:49.110
and the rate of return on it
falls with time,

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:54.048
that the working class is
eventually starved out,

00:11:54.048 --> 00:11:58.235
eviscerated to use the term,
the inevitable revolution in

00:11:58.235 --> 00:12:00.480
advanced capitalist systems.
 

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.975
The places the revolution
occurred were always in the

00:12:04.975 --> 00:12:10.509
least advanced market societies,
places like the Soviet Union.

00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:14.181
The theory of a universal
class, that once the working

00:12:14.181 --> 00:12:18.200
class captures society there
will be no class below it,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.188
and therefore,
no possibility of conflict and

00:12:22.188 --> 00:12:29.759
exploitation,
the withering away of the state.

00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:34.558
Well here are the places where
the revolution occurred in red,

00:12:34.558 --> 00:12:38.769
and it occurred in almost all
of them because the capitalist

00:12:38.769 --> 00:12:41.980
order was not developing and not
maturing,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:50.394
rather than that it was
developing and had exhausted

00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:51.879
itself.
 

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:59.220
The withering away of the state
takes awhile.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.798
This is from the Communist
Manifesto,

00:13:01.798 --> 00:13:04.019
and this is where he gets it
right.

00:13:04.019 --> 00:13:07.947
The notion that the
bourgeoisie, that is

00:13:07.947 --> 00:13:10.890
capitalists,
cannot exist without

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.755
constitution--constantly
revolutionizing the process of

00:13:14.755 --> 00:13:18.259
production,
that the conservation of old

00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:23.120
ways of doing things was
characteristic of every previous

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.678
economic system but not of
capitalism.

00:13:26.678 --> 00:13:32.379
"All that is solid melts
into air.

00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:37.360
So the flat part of this is
pre-capitalism,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.144
this is the Angus-Madison Curve
that Clark in his Farewell to

00:13:44.144 --> 00:13:48.129
Alms uses as his thesis
again,

00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:49.629
and again, and again.
 

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:52.110
And the upturn corresponds to
the capitalist era.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.697
Now it also corresponds to the
era of intensive use of fossil

00:13:56.697 --> 00:13:57.308
fuels.
 

00:13:57.308 --> 00:14:01.870
It also corresponds to the era
of radical urbanization,

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:06.596
and it also corresponds to a
period of extraordinarily fast

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:10.528
technological innovation,
and you can say that I give

00:14:10.528 --> 00:14:14.374
capitalism too much credit,
and I'll settle for agreeing

00:14:14.374 --> 00:14:15.190
with that.
 

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.399
But I will also say that
capitalism is a--

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:21.643
has within it,
endogenously,

00:14:21.643 --> 00:14:25.548
enormous incentives for
continuous technological

00:14:25.548 --> 00:14:29.787
innovation and for the rapid
deployment of desirable

00:14:29.787 --> 00:14:39.596
technologies,
and in that way it differs from

00:14:39.596 --> 00:14:44.590
all other systems.
 

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.083
Capitalism during its rule of
scarce 100 years has created

00:14:48.083 --> 00:14:51.823
more massive and more colossal
productive forces than have all

00:14:51.823 --> 00:14:53.970
preceding generations together.
 

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.830
That's a true statement.
 

00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:02.272
It was made in the winter of
1847-1848 and it was arguably

00:15:02.272 --> 00:15:08.149
true then, it is vastly more
obviously true today.

00:15:08.149 --> 00:15:11.580
That in roughly ten
generations, maybe twelve

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.779
generations,
capitalism has created more

00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:22.291
total wealth and total spending
power than all the economic

00:15:22.291 --> 00:15:28.690
systems which occupied human
history before that time.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.721
Now Gapminder,
I'm actually in a little bit of

00:15:31.721 --> 00:15:33.836
a--
I don't really have time for a

00:15:33.836 --> 00:15:36.592
Gapminder exercise,
but there it is,

00:15:36.592 --> 00:15:40.000
gapminder.org,
just go and play it.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.309
Play it for yourselves if you
want to be sure that we're not

00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:46.940
talking about something
imaginary.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:54.363
Now what an interesting
exercise to do is to single out

00:15:54.363 --> 00:16:02.750
some command economies such as
the Soviet Union before it--

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:09.028
in 1989, or Cuba throughout the
last sixty years and watch them,

00:16:09.028 --> 00:16:13.765
and what you'll find is they do
relatively well on the health

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:18.740
and longevity dimension and not
so well on the GDP dimension.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.942
It is perfectly reasonable for
someone to say,

00:16:22.942 --> 00:16:26.120
"I don't care about
wealth.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.320
I care about health and good
spirit and all that,

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.392
and I'm not interested in being
part of a society that generates

00:16:34.392 --> 00:16:37.690
enormous wealth,"
and there are very reasonable

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.470
and rational people who take
that view.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:45.374
It's an option and its fine,
it's even admirable,

00:16:45.374 --> 00:16:51.298
but it's not what capitalist
market societies are about.

00:16:51.298 --> 00:16:56.532
One reasonable critique of
capitalist market societies is

00:16:56.532 --> 00:17:01.764
that they encourage us all to
consume way beyond our real

00:17:01.764 --> 00:17:02.700
needs.
 

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.118
That we spend more money on
clothing and automobiles and

00:17:07.118 --> 00:17:10.654
sporting equipment,
and liquor than is really

00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:13.950
needed, and there's no doubt of
that.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:18.795
I'm guilty myself,
and my guess is that most of

00:17:18.795 --> 00:17:24.798
you feel the pull of market
society and the inclination to

00:17:24.798 --> 00:17:29.644
spend more than would be
absolutely rational or

00:17:29.644 --> 00:17:31.329
necessary.
 

00:17:31.329 --> 00:17:35.523
Fair enough;
it's a critique,

00:17:35.523 --> 00:17:38.720
and I think it's a valid one.
 

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.380
The state, property,
and capital;

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.118
back to Smith.
 

00:17:43.118 --> 00:17:48.210
Smith famously talked about the
night watchmen's fate,

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:53.011
the state which focuses
primarily on law and order,

00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:56.470
and the enforcement of
contract;

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:03.026
the state which makes it
possible for a person to own

00:18:03.026 --> 00:18:06.415
property,
to deploy that property

00:18:06.415 --> 00:18:10.928
productively,
and to make money by satisfying

00:18:10.928 --> 00:18:14.108
the apparent needs of others.
 

00:18:14.108 --> 00:18:19.257
Now in order to have a night
watchmen state you better have a

00:18:19.257 --> 00:18:22.162
state,
and Smith wrote roughly two

00:18:22.162 --> 00:18:25.148
centuries,
a century and a half,

00:18:25.148 --> 00:18:28.838
after the Treaty of Westphalia
1648,

00:18:28.838 --> 00:18:33.229
which was the launch point of
the modern nation's state system

00:18:33.229 --> 00:18:36.180
with a monopoly on force and
violence,

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:41.804
and Smith is in a sense
building a theoretical system on

00:18:41.804 --> 00:18:47.019
the foundation of state-enforced
property rights.

00:18:47.019 --> 00:18:50.798
In fact, not just in a way,
that is what he does.

00:18:50.798 --> 00:18:54.460
These are the states involved
in that treaty.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:19:00.769
This is Thomas Hobbs whose
Leviathan is the defining

00:19:00.769 --> 00:19:06.955
tract on nation states,
and which defines the leviathan

00:19:06.955 --> 00:19:11.180
as a monopolist on force and
violence.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:17.432
We prevent being the victims of
one another by entrusting to the

00:19:17.432 --> 00:19:23.190
state a full monopoly on the use
of force and violence,

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.650
and in that way,
profit enormously through

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.816
peace,
security, and the ability to

00:19:31.816 --> 00:19:37.618
plan ahead based on our current
property holdings.

00:19:37.618 --> 00:19:40.808
The nation state system lays
out like this.

00:19:40.808 --> 00:19:45.007
It is in many ways,
I think you can say this

00:19:45.007 --> 00:19:49.303
definitively,
capitalism without the nation's

00:19:49.303 --> 00:19:52.328
state system is infeasible.
 

00:19:52.328 --> 00:19:57.433
That if there were not the
coercive agency of the state in

00:19:57.433 --> 00:20:02.269
the background to vouch safe
property and contract,

00:20:02.269 --> 00:20:06.288
to perform the functions de
Soto attributes to it,

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:10.584
if it were not for that,
then none of the capital

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:15.594
formation processes that are
vital to our wealth would be

00:20:15.594 --> 00:20:17.920
reliable and feasible.
 

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.900
Now you could invent some
entirely different system.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.395
You could invent a system which
sliced the world on another

00:20:26.395 --> 00:20:30.893
angle, conceivably a functional
angle, or could be a gender

00:20:30.893 --> 00:20:33.220
organization in the world.
 

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.558
There could be a state for
women and a state for men,

00:20:36.558 --> 00:20:39.913
the geography of it would be a
little tangled but they're going

00:20:39.913 --> 00:20:43.777
to reproduce,
but the gist of this is that

00:20:43.777 --> 00:20:50.199
capitalist wealth rests on the
foundation of the nation state

00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:55.873
system and the nation state
system is not altogether a

00:20:55.873 --> 00:20:57.798
pretty story.
 

00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:02.365
Here's the British Empire as it
stood in 1920,

00:21:02.365 --> 00:21:06.727
or the 1920s,
and none of these places shown

00:21:06.727 --> 00:21:11.798
in red volunteered to join the
British Empire.

00:21:11.798 --> 00:21:15.858
Now you might claim that
Australia and New Zealand did,

00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:18.490
I think, but even that's a
reach.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.396
The British Empire was an
extremely coercive device for

00:21:23.396 --> 00:21:28.487
occupying territories and
extracting from their economies

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:32.848
a vast surplus for the
metropolitan country.

00:21:32.848 --> 00:21:37.180
It had many knock on effects
which worked out well.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:42.327
The--much of the infrastructure
and educational systems which

00:21:42.327 --> 00:21:47.388
makes India so promising today
is partly related to the best

00:21:47.388 --> 00:21:53.683
parts of British raj,
but the colonial background is

00:21:53.683 --> 00:21:58.288
a part of the nation state
story.

00:21:58.288 --> 00:22:06.990
The function of states having
no state versus a state,

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:10.170
having a failed state versus an
effective state,

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:15.239
having a state which fails to
promote formal property versus

00:22:15.239 --> 00:22:20.630
one that does,
the one point in the tree which

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:28.111
leads to the existence of what
de Soto calls live capital is

00:22:28.111 --> 00:22:33.037
this one,
and lucky for you and me,

00:22:33.037 --> 00:22:40.638
it is the one which envelops
our lives in the United States

00:22:40.638 --> 00:22:44.308
and in the western world.
 

00:22:44.308 --> 00:22:49.163
The--and de Soto's thesis
really boils down to this

00:22:49.163 --> 00:22:54.019
two-by-two table with dead
versus live capital,

00:22:54.019 --> 00:22:56.890
and formal versus informal
property rights,

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.938
but in the back of this is the
notion that you have to have a

00:23:00.938 --> 00:23:04.311
state which effectively and
efficiently administers

00:23:04.311 --> 00:23:05.190
property.
 

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:10.088
And that means an elaborate
court system,

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:12.730
a vast number of lawyers,
barristers,

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:16.950
and the like,
a huge recordkeeping system,

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:24.930
and a--and behind it all a
government capable of enforcing

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:31.930
property rights against theft
and expropriation.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.390
This map of this neighborhood
of New Haven,

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.750
the green lines are the
property lines,

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:42.673
and the vault at 200 Orange
Street contains the records

00:23:42.673 --> 00:23:46.960
corresponding to each of the
green polygons,

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.537
and in the city there are
26,000 and some green polygons

00:23:51.537 --> 00:23:55.726
like that,
and the whole surface of North

00:23:55.726 --> 00:24:01.008
America is covered with
analogous polygons which are

00:24:01.008 --> 00:24:04.839
seed points of capital
formation,

00:24:04.839 --> 00:24:14.108
and energize the economy.
 

00:24:14.108 --> 00:24:19.059
Now de Soto constructs a
strategy of conversion from dead

00:24:19.059 --> 00:24:24.127
capital to live,
toward the back part of the

00:24:24.127 --> 00:24:28.519
book with these phases
indicated,

00:24:28.519 --> 00:24:32.730
and in many parts of the world,
in much of Latin America,

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.450
much of Africa,
some parts of Asia,

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:43.432
the campaign to create live
capital is a very real and live

00:24:43.432 --> 00:24:48.070
campaign today,
and is strategically of

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.420
considerable importance.
 

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.730
As you think ahead to the case
you're going to write about,

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.569
in Cochabamba,
Bolivia, and about which we'll

00:24:57.569 --> 00:25:01.380
have a few minutes to talk
toward the end of this class,

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:08.576
the very informality of that
economy is part of what kills

00:25:08.576 --> 00:25:13.500
Bechtel and its development
projects.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:18.573
De Soto makes quite a lot of
how it is that you can't have an

00:25:18.573 --> 00:25:22.970
informal system of property and
then just impose,

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.876
cookie cutter style,
a formal system of property

00:25:25.876 --> 00:25:29.584
which no one understands,
and which doesn't correspond to

00:25:29.584 --> 00:25:30.538
their beliefs.
 

00:25:30.538 --> 00:25:34.690
You've got to adapt the formal
system to the informal system,

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:37.470
and if de Soto is right and I
think he is,

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:42.259
part of the brilliance of
American property law was that

00:25:42.259 --> 00:25:45.568
it found ways to incorporate
again,

00:25:45.568 --> 00:25:50.310
and again, and again to
incorporate informal property

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:55.768
rights like the Tomahawk farm,
or the miners' rights recorded

00:25:55.768 --> 00:26:00.257
in miners' association records
having no relationship to

00:26:00.257 --> 00:26:01.400
government.
 

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.119
Government didn't come along
and say,

00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:05.582
"No that's all baloney,
we're going to do it our

00:26:05.582 --> 00:26:07.420
way," government came along
and said,

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.079
"Oh we see,
now let's put that into

00:26:11.079 --> 00:26:15.680
language which can be
incorporated in the law,

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:21.866
and which can allow the law to
work with rather than against

00:26:21.866 --> 00:26:27.215
the property rights which you
have established among

00:26:27.215 --> 00:26:28.788
yourselves.
 

00:26:28.788 --> 00:26:40.680
Ron Coase, Coase is a Chicago
School economist and a--

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.410
and he's written--he wrote all
kinds of wonderful scholarship,

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.118
and what's called the Coase
Theorem is really post hoc

00:26:49.118 --> 00:26:51.288
reinterpretation of his work.
 

00:26:51.288 --> 00:26:55.261
He never sat down to write a
paper called "my

00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:58.910
theorem,"
and the insight in it is really

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:03.675
pretty straightforward,
and I make it a little simpler

00:27:03.675 --> 00:27:05.588
than he would like it.
 

00:27:05.588 --> 00:27:10.338
But as we said before,
where there are clear initial

00:27:10.338 --> 00:27:14.512
entitlements,
where the entitlements and the

00:27:14.512 --> 00:27:18.538
opportunity to change them are
transparent,

00:27:18.538 --> 00:27:22.743
and where the information is
shared in a way that is

00:27:22.743 --> 00:27:27.855
relatively symmetrical so that
we don't have situations where a

00:27:27.855 --> 00:27:32.721
buyer or a broker knows all
kinds of things which a customer

00:27:32.721 --> 00:27:36.539
doesn't know--
I said that wrong--where an

00:27:36.539 --> 00:27:41.282
owner or a broker knows all
kinds of things which a customer

00:27:41.282 --> 00:27:43.731
doesn't know;
and finally,

00:27:43.731 --> 00:27:45.960
low transaction costs.
 

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.935
A practical story;
have any of you ever been

00:27:48.935 --> 00:27:53.460
involved in a buying a house or
being part of a family as it

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.839
bought a house?
 

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:57.079
Yes.
 

00:27:57.079 --> 00:27:59.308
Okay, that's informative.
 

00:27:59.308 --> 00:28:02.843
Did you--what did you do to
remedy the information asymmetry

00:28:02.843 --> 00:28:04.578
between you and the seller?
 

00:28:04.578 --> 00:28:06.509
Student:  I didn't do
anything.

00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:09.738
Prof: You didn't do
anything, but what did your

00:28:09.738 --> 00:28:10.470
family do?
 

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:11.559
Student:  Visited the
house.

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:14.890
Prof: Okay and just that?
 

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:16.769
Student:  I'm sure they
had all sorts of papers but--

00:28:16.769 --> 00:28:20.886
Prof: I hope what they
did was hired someone to inspect

00:28:20.886 --> 00:28:23.250
the house and give them a
report.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:26.858
Let's check with the
gentle--behind you.

00:28:26.858 --> 00:28:28.450
Do you have experience with
this?

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:29.960
Student:  Yes.
 

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.965
Prof: And--
Student:  We had it

00:28:31.965 --> 00:28:32.380
appraised.
 

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.559
Prof: Okay you had an
appraisal.

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:34.358
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:28:34.358 --> 00:28:36.719
Prof: And did you have
anybody look at the pipes,

00:28:36.719 --> 00:28:38.349
and the roof,
and the--and all that?

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:38.630
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.390
Prof: Good I'm glad.
 

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:44.068
The--there's a--I say this
because I,

00:28:44.068 --> 00:28:48.125
four or five years ago bought a
house with a slate roof and I

00:28:48.125 --> 00:28:51.912
got a report which called the
condition of the slate roof

00:28:51.912 --> 00:28:53.670
"very good."
 

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.163
Well it turns out that
"very good"

00:28:56.163 --> 00:28:59.529
for a slate roof costs about
$20,000 a year in repairs,

00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:02.278
so it was a very bad decision
on my part,

00:29:02.278 --> 00:29:08.855
but the information symmetry
part of this is central and the

00:29:08.855 --> 00:29:13.868
idea is that you can get
efficient market,

00:29:13.868 --> 00:29:18.271
including an efficient
formation of capital through

00:29:18.271 --> 00:29:23.380
leveraging real property where
those conditions are met.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:28.471
So as a practical guide in
doing things you get three

00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:34.444
things to tick on your fingers
and think about in managing the

00:29:34.444 --> 00:29:38.460
affairs of an organization or a
firm.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:44.977
This is too complicated;
the rough idea here is to take

00:29:44.977 --> 00:29:50.134
the three factors in Coase and
run them against the obvious

00:29:50.134 --> 00:29:54.759
aspects of the nation state
system and look how--

00:29:54.759 --> 00:30:01.082
take an example technology
transfer relates to transparency

00:30:01.082 --> 00:30:07.185
so that where one segment of
society has unique access to

00:30:07.185 --> 00:30:12.308
technology and knowledge that
others lack,

00:30:12.308 --> 00:30:16.301
you can assume there will be
huge asymmetries in the

00:30:16.301 --> 00:30:20.763
distribution of information and
that that will distort the

00:30:20.763 --> 00:30:25.848
functioning of the economy,
and sure enough it does,

00:30:25.848 --> 00:30:31.865
and part of the justification
for government provision of

00:30:31.865 --> 00:30:37.991
public education is that it
provides the minimum access to

00:30:37.991 --> 00:30:44.547
information and the methods of
obtaining information which are

00:30:44.547 --> 00:30:51.640
required by citizenship in a
democratic and market society.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.477
With any market economy you're
going to expect to move

00:30:55.477 --> 00:30:57.650
northeast of the status quo.
 

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:01.972
I did an elaborate exercise
with Edgeworth boxes with you

00:31:01.972 --> 00:31:05.680
about a month ago,
and where you start determines

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.068
where you end.
 

00:31:07.068 --> 00:31:11.593
So if we start here,
where the Smith's have almost

00:31:11.593 --> 00:31:16.670
everything, we're going to end
up somewhere up there.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:18.823
Or here where the Joneses own
almost everything,

00:31:18.823 --> 00:31:20.608
we're going to end up somewhere
here.

00:31:20.608 --> 00:31:25.962
So what Coase doesn't say is
that there is some particular

00:31:25.962 --> 00:31:31.130
symmetry or justice to the way
property rights move,

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:35.240
and indeed, it's worth stopping
to say that to ourselves.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.842
Whomsoever expects social
justice from a market economy

00:31:40.842 --> 00:31:42.710
expects in vain.
 

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.038
That's not what market
economies are good at,

00:31:45.038 --> 00:31:52.840
they're good at a lot of
things, but you cannot when you

00:31:52.840 --> 00:32:00.317
are a wealthy septuagenarian,
and I'm at least one of those

00:32:00.317 --> 00:32:06.701
two, you cannot say to yourself
that it is the just verdict that

00:32:06.701 --> 00:32:11.970
the American economy that I
should be well to do.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:16.328
It has in it all kinds of
happenstance factors,

00:32:16.328 --> 00:32:22.523
including the luck of one's
birth, and the generosity of

00:32:22.523 --> 00:32:27.480
one's educators that those
things happen,

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:33.588
and so the claim I--people,
I am clearly pro-capitalist,

00:32:33.588 --> 00:32:36.259
but when I argue with people
and they say,

00:32:36.259 --> 00:32:38.570
"Well you know there are
all kinds of people who have

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.962
more money than they deserve and
others who have less,"

00:32:40.962 --> 00:32:42.690
I say,
"Yes, I agree,

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:47.068
and there may be other remedies
you want to take for that."

00:32:47.068 --> 00:32:51.112
For example,
giving some people some of your

00:32:51.112 --> 00:32:56.189
own money, but the claim for
capitalism just doesn't go

00:32:56.189 --> 00:32:57.130
there.
 

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:00.838
Wealth maximizing law and the
joint stock corporation;

00:33:00.838 --> 00:33:06.150
the law that government creates
can either be well designed or

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:10.678
poorly designed to create
wealth, and we started some

00:33:10.678 --> 00:33:13.288
months ago with Ghen v.
 

00:33:13.288 --> 00:33:18.232
Rich, the matter of a
sinking whale and the tailoring

00:33:18.232 --> 00:33:23.616
of the judgment in that case to
preserve the incentive for the

00:33:23.616 --> 00:33:28.324
whaling industry,
by allowing the principle gains

00:33:28.324 --> 00:33:33.048
to go to those who take the
largest risks and make the

00:33:33.048 --> 00:33:37.685
largest investment and that's
the intuition of wealth

00:33:37.685 --> 00:33:39.470
maximizing law.
 

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.917
Another case we I think looked
at, I'm not quite sure,

00:33:42.917 --> 00:33:44.023
did we do U.S.
 

00:33:44.023 --> 00:33:44.348
v.
 

00:33:44.348 --> 00:33:46.750
Cosby, the one about air
rights?

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.038
Well you get it.
 

00:33:48.038 --> 00:33:51.896
Before the airplane it was
perfectly sensible to say that

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:55.755
the air rights over one's land
extended to the end of the

00:33:55.755 --> 00:33:59.489
universe,
or at least until they got to

00:33:59.489 --> 00:34:02.640
the next inhabited solar system.
 

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.230
That was a perfectly okay thing
to say and did no harm,

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:10.659
but once air travel became part
of the technology,

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:14.853
it had to change that precept
and grant the right of free

00:34:14.853 --> 00:34:17.550
trespass above a certain
altitude.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:24.527
This is Marc Lanier;
did I show you guys a little

00:34:24.527 --> 00:34:25.820
bit of Marc Lanier?
 

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:30.480
Okay and the dark side of
wealth max--the top side of

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.139
wealth maximizing law is tort
law and the lawsuit.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:40.536
But the thinking behind having
lawsuits is that lawsuits

00:34:40.536 --> 00:34:46.422
provide an incentive against
carelessness in dealing with the

00:34:46.422 --> 00:34:51.623
lives of others and the
punishment that a company gets

00:34:51.623 --> 00:34:56.920
for producing a hazardous
product or performing a risky

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:02.905
and failed medical procedure is
a way of keeping manufacturers

00:35:02.905 --> 00:35:07.909
and healthcare people honest and
careful.

00:35:07.909 --> 00:35:18.860
The critical features of the
joint stock corporation,

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:22.135
as compared with
straightforward proprietorship

00:35:22.135 --> 00:35:25.349
and partnership,
are first of all that the chain

00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:26.969
of accountability is thin.
 

00:35:26.969 --> 00:35:30.989
That is the customer's and
investors;

00:35:30.989 --> 00:35:35.431
both have only a thin
relationship with the decision

00:35:35.431 --> 00:35:37.260
makers in the firm.
 

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:41.523
If you owned 1,000 shares of
General Motors and you think

00:35:41.523 --> 00:35:44.949
they shouldn't have fired Fritz
yesterday,

00:35:44.949 --> 00:35:47.182
as they did,
you're going to waste your

00:35:47.182 --> 00:35:49.768
money by calling them up to talk
about it.

00:35:49.768 --> 00:35:52.855
If you're the owner of a
General Motors car and you don't

00:35:52.855 --> 00:35:55.280
like the way the door handles
are put on,

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.884
it's not much use calling them
up and asking them to do it

00:35:58.884 --> 00:35:59.768
differently.
 

00:35:59.768 --> 00:36:04.070
What you have to do is buy
another manufacturer's car.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.869
The role of ownership is
passive.

00:36:06.869 --> 00:36:12.735
The investors buy shares and if
they don't like the course of

00:36:12.735 --> 00:36:17.429
the company's management they
sell the shares.

00:36:17.429 --> 00:36:21.463
Liability is limited;
the most that an investor can

00:36:21.463 --> 00:36:25.737
lose is what she put into the
shares that she purchased,

00:36:25.737 --> 00:36:28.690
and that's a great provision
right.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:33.047
If you're an investor it means
that you really don't have to do

00:36:33.047 --> 00:36:35.929
much homework,
at least homework about the

00:36:35.929 --> 00:36:38.530
downside of management
practices.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.510
Liquidity is like water.
 

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:44.686
It is a perfectly liquid
instrument and it is an

00:36:44.686 --> 00:36:49.590
endlessly scalable instrument,
and the joint stock corporation

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:53.871
is about--
between 88% to 90% of a market

00:36:53.871 --> 00:36:59.719
economy is embodied in joint
stock corporations.

00:36:59.719 --> 00:37:03.210
Whenever there are flaws,
and their flaws are many,

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:06.239
Jim Alexander here has told you
of a few,

00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:12.376
their flaws are many but the
ability to produce at enormous

00:37:12.376 --> 00:37:15.612
scale,
with enormous efficiency,

00:37:15.612 --> 00:37:16.889
is very real.
 

00:37:16.889 --> 00:37:22.364
I'll post these slides so you
don't need to write down all my

00:37:22.364 --> 00:37:23.460
squiggles.
 

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:29.380
But the most important feature
is that you've got centralized

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:35.201
management which has a thin
relationship both with customers

00:37:35.201 --> 00:37:41.516
and with investors and is--
and has the capacity to engage

00:37:41.516 --> 00:37:48.250
in efficient production of stuff
people actually want to buy.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:53.570
Vertical integration is a key
feature of companies like this,

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:59.094
vertical integration meaning
that the company engages itself

00:37:59.094 --> 00:38:03.309
in a long chain of activities
which start,

00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:06.739
in the extreme case,
start with raw materials.

00:38:06.739 --> 00:38:09.590
For example,
iron ore in the ground,

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:15.697
tobacco growing in the field,
lobsters crawling about under

00:38:15.697 --> 00:38:21.699
Penobscot Bay and finishes with
lobsters on the plate,

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:27.570
with a completed automobile or
whatever,

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:32.297
and vertical integration
creates an enormously difficult

00:38:32.297 --> 00:38:36.777
management challenge,
and often companies wisely walk

00:38:36.777 --> 00:38:39.039
away from some aspect of it.
 

00:38:39.039 --> 00:38:40.842
The car companies,
for example,

00:38:40.842 --> 00:38:43.849
have been shedding the
manufacture of many of their

00:38:43.849 --> 00:38:47.335
intermediate parts now for
thirty or forty years because it

00:38:47.335 --> 00:38:49.320
was so difficult to manage.
 

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:54.465
But the advantage is that it
gives the company enormous

00:38:54.465 --> 00:39:00.469
autonomy from others who seek to
intervene in its operations.

00:39:00.469 --> 00:39:03.942
The vertically integrated
corporation is also,

00:39:03.942 --> 00:39:08.880
from a public perception point
of view, quite often a monster.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:15.681
Alex, I think it was,
referred us to the picture of a

00:39:15.681 --> 00:39:23.661
vampire squid for Goldman Sachs
and that picture actually goes

00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:27.231
back--
this is an 1881 cartoon of

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:32.278
Standard Oil pictured not as a
vampire squid but as a giant

00:39:32.278 --> 00:39:37.500
squid with tentacles reaching
into everyone's living room and

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.980
it was that.
 

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:46.713
Vertical integration from an
olive grove to Palmolive Soap,

00:39:46.713 --> 00:39:50.179
that's the gist of this.
 

00:39:50.179 --> 00:39:54.217
The slogan on the Palmolive
Soap, "I learned from a

00:39:54.217 --> 00:39:57.518
beauty expert how to hold my
husband."

00:39:57.518 --> 00:40:02.210
That's a terrible way to sell
people soap.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:03.980
That is just wrong.
 

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.210
It just is.
 

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:12.556
But marketing does that and
it's part of the package in a

00:40:12.556 --> 00:40:15.730
capitalist market society.
 

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:20.610
The first great corporations
were the American railroads,

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:23.719
or at least in American
history, and the Alfred Chandler

00:40:23.719 --> 00:40:26.940
piece about the Pennsylvania
railroad is a good example of

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.449
this.
 

00:40:27.449 --> 00:40:32.731
They involve enormously large
scale investment of capital in

00:40:32.731 --> 00:40:37.030
the railroad infrastructure in
rolling stock,

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:41.454
and they created a challenge to
management which no previous

00:40:41.454 --> 00:40:43.179
business had created.
 

00:40:43.179 --> 00:40:47.766
So you've got 50,000 employees,
and you've got these enormous

00:40:47.766 --> 00:40:52.199
contraptions running at one
another all over the place,

00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:55.387
and incidentally,
in the early years killing

00:40:55.387 --> 00:40:59.762
5,000 or 10,000 people a year
and the management of all that

00:40:59.762 --> 00:41:02.949
required one of the great
revolutions,

00:41:02.949 --> 00:41:06.159
which I have spent little time
on in this course,

00:41:06.159 --> 00:41:08.940
where in the joint stock
corporation,

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.211
you've developed a huge cadre
of professionally trained

00:41:12.211 --> 00:41:15.697
managers,
like the crowd sitting back

00:41:15.697 --> 00:41:21.722
right, soon to be freshly minted
Yale MBA's who are going to

00:41:21.722 --> 00:41:24.478
run--
I don't think they're going to

00:41:24.478 --> 00:41:28.018
run trains,
but they're going to run big,

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:29.880
complicated things.
 

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.199
Goldman Sachs is a different
kettle of fish.

00:41:34.199 --> 00:41:37.860
Goldman Sachs is not vertically
integrated at all.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:43.956
It occupies a strategic
position in the economy which

00:41:43.956 --> 00:41:47.721
allows it,
economy and government,

00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:53.550
which allows it to create--
to use enormous leverage and

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:59.418
enormously high powered
expertise to generate revenues

00:41:59.418 --> 00:42:04.070
on a more or less unprecedented
scale,

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:08.268
and Paolo Zanonni is my very
dear friend.

00:42:08.268 --> 00:42:11.262
He really is,
I mean we're really good

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:15.710
friends, but I would say--I
would say it to his face.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.050
I probably wouldn't say it in
front of 100 people to his face,

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:22.340
but I would say it to his face
that he earns way too much

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.382
money,
just outrageous how much money

00:42:25.382 --> 00:42:26.219
he earns.
 

00:42:26.219 --> 00:42:30.690
Now I wouldn't invent a law to
take his money away but I do

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:35.239
think that there's more of it
than he needs or deserves,

00:42:35.239 --> 00:42:38.909
but like I said capitalism
doesn't solve that problem.

00:42:38.909 --> 00:42:44.800
This is the inner courtyard at
Infosys in Bangalore,

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:52.541
in India, and the process of
very rapid formation of gigantic

00:42:52.541 --> 00:42:56.717
wealth in--
through the best joint stock

00:42:56.717 --> 00:43:01.802
corporations is a worldwide
event and the world would be a

00:43:01.802 --> 00:43:05.460
better place if there were more
of it.

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:12.989
The Ibbotson slides which I
showed you some months ago,

00:43:12.989 --> 00:43:17.784
for the U.S.,
summarized what becomes of a

00:43:17.784 --> 00:43:24.215
dollar invested in 1927 as
common stock and that kind of

00:43:24.215 --> 00:43:30.764
growth is characteristic only of
very well managed equity

00:43:30.764 --> 00:43:32.869
investments.
 

00:43:32.869 --> 00:43:40.800
Greater possibilities with free
society;

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.400
Hayek conceives a society as a
learning machine,

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:50.851
and the score of knowledge and
institutional practices which

00:43:50.851 --> 00:43:54.179
are built up in a market
society,

00:43:54.179 --> 00:43:59.820
build up in an exponential way
like the green curve here,

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:06.313
and the most important fact
about that is that no individual

00:44:06.313 --> 00:44:12.369
knows a very high fraction of
the total knowledge of the

00:44:12.369 --> 00:44:13.579
system.
 

00:44:13.579 --> 00:44:17.909
We are all--we all need to be
self consciously humble about

00:44:17.909 --> 00:44:22.088
how little it is we know about
the total operation of the

00:44:22.088 --> 00:44:22.909
system.
 

00:44:22.909 --> 00:44:28.838
We are all looking at 1%,
3%, 2% of the data which make

00:44:28.838 --> 00:44:33.230
our society function or fail to
do so.

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:36.195
That condition,
it's more and more obvious,

00:44:36.195 --> 00:44:36.760
right?
 

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:42.079
If you think about what it is
that is on the screen in your--

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:45.873
on your study desk,
what's accessible on that

00:44:45.873 --> 00:44:51.132
screen at any given moment is
thousands of times more than you

00:44:51.132 --> 00:44:53.030
will ever command.
 

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:56.849
I'm going to have to stop there
with that and go back and go to

00:44:56.849 --> 00:45:01.268
the case,
because I want to have time for

00:45:01.268 --> 00:45:04.320
that,
and I'll post--I've got three

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:08.838
or for more topics there but
I'll post the slides and I want

00:45:08.838 --> 00:45:11.289
to discuss the case with you.
 

00:45:11.289 --> 00:45:23.797
Of--can we turn this--how many
of you were able to look at the

00:45:23.797 --> 00:45:28.719
Finnegan piece so far?
 

00:45:28.719 --> 00:45:38.364
Got your attention, good;
you ought to start by--I would

00:45:38.364 --> 00:45:46.626
start interpreting this story by
asking yourself about Bolivia's

00:45:46.626 --> 00:45:54.364
history in social composition
and where it fits in the world

00:45:54.364 --> 00:45:56.070
economy.
 

00:45:56.070 --> 00:46:02.742
How it relates to Paul
Collier's Bottom Billion

00:46:02.742 --> 00:46:07.780
and here's one obvious way it
relates.

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:13.590
Collier has a series of what he
calls traps, if you run Bolivia

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:19.027
through all the traps you will
see that it is not a favored

00:46:19.027 --> 00:46:20.059
nation.
 

00:46:20.059 --> 00:46:25.509
It is a nation which has many
vulnerabilities,

00:46:25.509 --> 00:46:33.260
and it is consequently on the
lower edge of the world economy.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:41.630
Now, it has a city called
Cochabamba, about 800,000 people

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:50.588
with a water company called--a
water agency called Siempas and

00:46:50.588 --> 00:46:54.699
that agency is terrible.
 

00:46:54.699 --> 00:46:59.360
It does a very poor job of
delivering water.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:05.849
It is also corrupt and a very
high fraction of the water

00:47:05.849 --> 00:47:10.570
distributed is distributed
illegally,

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:14.945
people tap into it,
just as in poor countries

00:47:14.945 --> 00:47:21.309
people tap into the power cables
that run through their areas.

00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:27.329
The--there are two gigantic
agencies,

00:47:27.329 --> 00:47:30.590
The World Bank and The
International Monetary Fund,

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:34.289
which believe in markets in a
big way,

00:47:34.289 --> 00:47:41.485
and they have pressured Bolivia
and fifty or seventy-five

00:47:41.485 --> 00:47:49.195
similar bottom billion countries
to marketize their economies

00:47:49.195 --> 00:47:53.179
through private investment.
 

00:47:53.179 --> 00:48:00.375
And the gist of the story is
that the investment of private

00:48:00.375 --> 00:48:05.090
capital will incentivize
companies,

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:11.639
typically well financed joint
stock corporations,

00:48:11.639 --> 00:48:15.880
to do an awful lot better job
of providing water,

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.054
electricity,
rail service,

00:48:19.054 --> 00:48:23.213
air service,
all the basic functions of an

00:48:23.213 --> 00:48:27.487
economy will be better performed
privately than the were

00:48:27.487 --> 00:48:28.420
publicly.
 

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:34.222
The people who are--the
inspirers of that are called The

00:48:34.222 --> 00:48:37.849
Chicago Boys,
a group of young economists,

00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:40.829
the most famous of whom is
Jeffrey Sachs,

00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:45.518
who was then at Chicago but is
now at Columbia,

00:48:45.518 --> 00:48:52.989
and the market tonic is what
was applied in this case.

00:48:52.989 --> 00:49:00.509
Now the case didn't work,
the tonic didn't work and one

00:49:00.509 --> 00:49:08.864
conclusion is that market reform
is altogether wrong and will

00:49:08.864 --> 00:49:11.650
fail everywhere.
 

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:15.405
I think you can gather some
evidence through your reading

00:49:15.405 --> 00:49:19.230
and through Collier one way or
the other on that point.

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:24.449
The gist of the question,
which I'll post tomorrow,

00:49:24.449 --> 00:49:31.989
is explain what happened when
Bechtel,

00:49:31.989 --> 00:49:35.230
through its wholly owned
subsidiary,

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:40.190
went into Cochabamba to
re-conceive,

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:43.639
reconfigure,
and reconstruct the water

00:49:43.639 --> 00:49:44.480
system.
 

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.922
Interpret that story in light
of the most important things

00:49:49.922 --> 00:49:52.980
you've learned in this course.
 

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:56.960
Are there questions?
 

00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:03.262
Okay we'll see each other again
on December 14,

00:50:03.262 --> 00:50:05.179
at the exam.
 

00:50:05.179 --> 00:50:16.000

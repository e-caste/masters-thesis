00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.504
Professor Steven Smith:
I want to begin today with

00:00:06.504 --> 00:00:09.420
concluding Aristotle,
part three.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.406
Before I do,
however, could I just ask the

00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:16.720
people--yes, thank you so much.
And your neighbor, too?

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.560
Would you mind?
Thank you so much.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.250
Just out of respect to Mr.
Aristotle.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.516
It's mister to you.
I want to talk today about

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:35.140
Aristotle's discovery of
America.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.169
This will probably come as a
surprise to some of you that

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:43.198
Aristotle discovered America,
but I will get to that in a

00:00:43.198 --> 00:00:46.724
minute.
In many ways for Aristotle,

00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:52.600
as it is for every student of
politics, the most serious,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.345
the most difficult issue one
confronts is the problem of

00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:02.359
faction.
How to control for factions.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.829
How to control for conflict
between factions.

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.666
That is the issue addressed
especially in Books IV and V of

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:18.921
the Politics,
where Aristotle goes on to

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:25.355
describe by the term polity,
the regime that he believes

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:31.790
most successfully controls for
the theme of faction.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.880
The essential feature of this
regime, the polity,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.759
which in fact he gives the name
politea,

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.790
the generic Greek word for
regime.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.744
The polity is the regime that
represents, for Aristotle,

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:55.879
a mixture of the principles of
oligarchy and democracy.

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:01.083
Therefore, he says,
avoids dominance by either

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:03.981
extreme.
By combining elements,

00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:08.887
as it were, of the few and the
many, polity is characterized by

00:02:08.887 --> 00:02:13.240
the dominance of the middle
class, the middle group.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.941
The middle class,
he says, is able to achieve the

00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:21.106
confidence of both extreme
parties where at least it is

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:25.733
sufficiently numerous to avoid
the problems of class struggle

00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:30.403
and factional conflict.
"Where the middling element is

00:02:30.403 --> 00:02:34.864
great," Aristotle writes,
"factional conflict and splits

00:02:34.864 --> 00:02:38.919
over the nature of regimes occur
least of all."

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:43.123
So Aristotle,
in a way, has discovered long

00:02:43.123 --> 00:02:49.530
before James Madison's famous
article in Federalist Number 10,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.793
the remedy for the control and
containment, so to speak,

00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:59.583
of faction.
You remember,

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:03.878
many of you if not all of you
who have read the Tenth

00:03:03.878 --> 00:03:07.673
Federalist Paper,
that Madison outlines a scheme

00:03:07.673 --> 00:03:11.102
for an extended republic,
he says, where numerous

00:03:11.102 --> 00:03:12.982
factions,
in many ways,

00:03:12.982 --> 00:03:17.547
check and balance one another,
compete with one another and

00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:20.971
therefore,
avoid the dominance of a single

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:25.310
faction leading to the kind of
tyranny of the majority,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.580
the tyranny of the majority
class.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.616
Aristotle's proposal for a
mixture of oligarchy and

00:03:32.616 --> 00:03:35.199
democracy seems,
in many ways,

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.498
to anticipate,
2,000 years before the fact,

00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:43.290
Madison's call for a government
where powers must be separated

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.530
and where,
he says in Federalist Number

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.041
51, ambition must be made to
counteract ambition in order to

00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:52.988
avoid,
in other words,

00:03:52.988 --> 00:03:56.680
the extremes of both tyranny
and civil war.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.283
The inevitable conclusion that
I reach and I believe any

00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:06.389
sensible reader of Aristotle
would reach is that Aristotle,

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:11.112
in fact, discovered the
American Constitution 1,500 or

00:04:11.112 --> 00:04:14.319
2,000 years before it was
written.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.665
This may seem surprising to
you, since of course Aristotle

00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:21.378
lived long before.
But that may simply be our own

00:04:21.378 --> 00:04:25.863
prejudice to think that my
friend at the CUNY Graduate

00:04:25.863 --> 00:04:27.759
Center,
Peter Simpson,

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.581
has argued in a paper that I
found quite convincing,

00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:34.925
that Aristotle had,
in fact, discovered the

00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:37.944
American Constitution.
I say, it may simply be our

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.497
prejudice that he didn't.
Aristotle writes,

00:04:40.497 --> 00:04:44.028
in Book II of the
Politics that the world

00:04:44.028 --> 00:04:48.160
is eternal and everything in it
has been discovered.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.869
The earth experiences,
he says, certain periodic

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:56.288
destructions and cataclysms,
civilizations are reduced to

00:04:56.288 --> 00:04:59.839
barbarism only to recover and
grow again.

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:02.051
If this theory,
you might say,

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:06.626
of sort of cataclysmic change
is true, we cannot rule out the

00:05:06.626 --> 00:05:11.278
possibility that a constitution
like ours or even identical to

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:15.319
ours existed at some point in
the ancient past,

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.190
in the far distant past that
Aristotle knew about.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.290
Do you think that's possible?
Well, why not?

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.117
But Aristotle's mixed
constitution differs from ours

00:05:30.117 --> 00:05:34.459
still in certain important
respects.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:38.928
Aristotle understands the mixed
constitution as a balance of

00:05:38.928 --> 00:05:42.110
classes--the one,
the few, and the many.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.748
He doesn't so much insist,
as you will see in your

00:05:45.748 --> 00:05:49.311
reading, on the actual
separation of functions of

00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:52.949
government, putting them into
separate hands.

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.588
It is enough for him,
he says, if each class shares

00:05:56.588 --> 00:05:59.500
in some aspect of the governing
power.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.639
But that leads to a further
difference.

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.809
We tend to think of the
separation of powers doctrine as

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:14.054
necessary for the security and
liberty of the individual,

00:06:14.054 --> 00:06:17.347
don't we?
We usually think of individual

00:06:17.347 --> 00:06:21.577
freedom and security as the
purpose of the separation of

00:06:21.577 --> 00:06:24.464
power.
It is when political functions

00:06:24.464 --> 00:06:27.829
become concentrated into the
hands of, again,

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:32.185
the too few hands that we risk
arbitrary government and the

00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:35.790
endangerment to the liberty of
the individual.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.072
But for Aristotle,
it is not the liberty of the

00:06:40.072 --> 00:06:44.726
individual so much as the
functioning or functional

00:06:44.726 --> 00:06:49.940
well-being of the city that is
the highest priority.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.561
Individual freedom may be,
at best, a desirable byproduct

00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:57.449
of the Aristotelian mixed
regime,

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:02.509
but individual freedom is not
its defining or principle goal.

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:06.899
For anyone interested in this
difference, I suggest you

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:11.857
contrast or compare Aristotle's
account of mixed government to

00:07:11.857 --> 00:07:16.327
Book XI of Montesquieu's
Spirit of the Laws or to

00:07:16.327 --> 00:07:21.204
some of the central Federalist
papers to see the way in which

00:07:21.204 --> 00:07:22.911
Mr.
Aristotle revised,

00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:26.649
in some ways,
the wisdom of Madison.

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:29.699
You could compare them in some
way that I think would be

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:32.579
valuable.
Not only did Aristotle

00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:38.871
understand the importance of the
separation of powers doctrine

00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:44.854
and the kind of balance of
factions as a way of controlling

00:07:44.854 --> 00:07:49.642
conflict and struggle,
but he also understood the

00:07:49.642 --> 00:07:53.879
importance of property and
private property and commerce

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:58.410
for a flourishing republic.
We didn't really pause to talk

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.705
much about this,
but in Book II,

00:08:00.705 --> 00:08:04.059
you remember,
he criticizes at considerable

00:08:04.059 --> 00:08:08.249
length Plato's Republic
for the excessive unity it

00:08:08.249 --> 00:08:12.941
demands of its citizens.
Socrates demands for common

00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:17.889
ownership of property,
at least among the auxiliary

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:20.841
class.
But Aristotle claims that the

00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:24.416
city is not naturally one.
That is to say,

00:08:24.416 --> 00:08:30.160
a certain diversity is
necessary to make up a city.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.631
Where all property is held in
common, it is more likely to

00:08:36.631 --> 00:08:43.669
suffer from common neglect than
it is from common ownership.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.131
He clearly understands,
in many ways,

00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:49.549
the virtues of private property
and of commerce.

00:08:49.549 --> 00:08:52.021
It is evident,
Aristotle writes,

00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:56.964
that as it becomes increasingly
one, as it becomes increasingly

00:08:56.964 --> 00:09:01.029
unified--the city--it will no
longer be a city.

00:09:01.029 --> 00:09:03.220
A city is, in its nature,
a multitude.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.228
As it becomes more of a unity,
it will be like a household

00:09:07.228 --> 00:09:11.095
instead of a polis and a
human being instead of a

00:09:11.095 --> 00:09:14.585
household.
There we see in Book II,

00:09:14.585 --> 00:09:18.868
Aristotle offering his
criticism of the claims for the

00:09:18.868 --> 00:09:22.990
sort of excessive unification of
centralization,

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:29.079
concentration of property.
Yet, despite his awareness of

00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:34.529
the importance of commerce and
the importance of property,

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:37.141
the aim of the city,
he tells us,

00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:40.242
is not wealth,
is not the production of

00:09:40.242 --> 00:09:43.118
wealth.
In that way it would be useful

00:09:43.118 --> 00:09:46.878
to make a contrast between
Aristotle and someone like Adam

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:50.769
Smith, the great author of
The Wealth of Nations.

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:55.809
If wealth were the purpose of
politics, Aristotle writes,

00:09:55.809 --> 00:09:58.779
the Phoenicians,
you might say,

00:09:58.779 --> 00:10:02.658
in the ancient world--the
Phoenicians were the commercial

00:10:02.658 --> 00:10:06.468
people par excellence--the
Phoenicians would be the best

00:10:06.468 --> 00:10:09.480
regime.
But he denies that.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.922
Aristotle could never endorse
the view stated by a famous

00:10:13.922 --> 00:10:18.840
American president that the
business of America is business.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.598
The political partnership,
he says, must be regarded for

00:10:23.598 --> 00:10:27.059
the sake of noble acts performed
well.

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:30.032
Wealth, property,
he tells us,

00:10:30.032 --> 00:10:35.772
exists for the sake of virtue,
not virtue for the sake of

00:10:35.772 --> 00:10:38.922
wealth.
Just as Aristotle would have

00:10:38.922 --> 00:10:43.328
been critical of the American
tendency to regard government as

00:10:43.328 --> 00:10:47.590
for the sake of business or for
the sake of the economy,

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:52.296
he also criticized beforehand
the American tendency to

00:10:52.296 --> 00:10:57.156
organize into clubs,
what we call political parties

00:10:57.156 --> 00:11:02.679
which exacerbate rather than
control political conflict.

00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:07.000
These political clubs or
parties use their influence to

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.064
incense the populous,
using their power to whip up

00:11:11.064 --> 00:11:16.069
dangerous passions that tend to
make American politicians closer

00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:20.754
to demagogues than to statesmen.
He would also regard the

00:11:20.754 --> 00:11:25.593
peculiar American practice of
elections, rather than the Greek

00:11:25.593 --> 00:11:29.639
practice of appointing political
offices by lot.

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:33.575
He would regard elections as
merely exacerbating the tendency

00:11:33.575 --> 00:11:36.503
to demagoguery,
where each person seeking

00:11:36.503 --> 00:11:40.782
office plays shamelessly to the
mob, promising all manner of

00:11:40.782 --> 00:11:44.990
things that they know they will
not and cannot deliver.

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:51.509
Think of almost anybody you
like.

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:55.129
Furthermore,
while the American regime in

00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:57.481
many ways is,
in principle,

00:11:57.481 --> 00:12:02.730
open to all and prides itself
on a belief in equality,

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.789
no doubt Aristotle would remark
that its offices are,

00:12:06.789 --> 00:12:11.474
in fact, open only to the rich
and to leaders who can acquire

00:12:11.474 --> 00:12:16.743
the support of the rich,
making it rather an oligarchy

00:12:16.743 --> 00:12:22.078
in the guise of a republic.
So Aristotle was not without

00:12:22.078 --> 00:12:26.880
his own critique of the American
constitution and American

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.880
political culture.
There is, obviously,

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.450
much in the American regime
that Aristotle would have found

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.817
admirable,
even though it does not conform

00:12:36.817 --> 00:12:41.620
to his idea of the best regime,
which is the subject of the

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.685
last two books of the
Politics,

00:12:44.685 --> 00:12:48.933
Book VII and VIII.
Aristotle is very sketchy here

00:12:48.933 --> 00:12:52.840
about the structure,
the institutional structure,

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.865
the make-up of the best regime,
acknowledging the best regime

00:12:57.865 --> 00:13:02.138
is one where the best men rule.
That is to say,

00:13:02.138 --> 00:13:07.870
it is a kind of aristocracy or
an aristocratic republic.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.028
I want to talk about this
regime a little bit now,

00:13:11.028 --> 00:13:14.574
what Aristotle understands to
be the requirements or the

00:13:14.574 --> 00:13:17.685
fulfillments,
the necessities,

00:13:17.685 --> 00:13:23.418
of this aristocratic republic.
In these parts of the

00:13:23.418 --> 00:13:27.076
Politics,
Aristotle offers a serious

00:13:27.076 --> 00:13:31.692
challenge to existing Greek
traditions and patterns of

00:13:31.692 --> 00:13:35.433
political education.
Every bit, in many ways,

00:13:35.433 --> 00:13:38.299
is far reaching as Plato's
Republic.

00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:42.723
In the first place,
he tells us the purpose of the

00:13:42.723 --> 00:13:48.049
best regime, the purpose of
Aristotle's Republic is directed

00:13:48.049 --> 00:13:51.389
not to war, but in fact to
peace.

00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:56.246
The citizen of the best regime,
he says, must be able to

00:13:56.246 --> 00:14:01.457
sustain war if duty requires,
but only for the sake of peace

00:14:01.457 --> 00:14:06.356
and leisure.
Again, a critique not only of

00:14:06.356 --> 00:14:13.570
Sparta, but also of Athens and
its imperialistic ambitions.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.544
Second, Aristotle understands
the purpose of leisure when he

00:14:17.544 --> 00:14:21.519
says the end of the regime is
peace and the purpose of peace

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:24.826
is leisure.
He doesn't understand by

00:14:24.826 --> 00:14:30.184
leisure simply relaxation,
enjoying your private moments,

00:14:30.184 --> 00:14:35.515
enjoying your vacation time.
Leisure does not simply mean

00:14:35.515 --> 00:14:39.486
rest or inactivity,
but leisure is necessary for

00:14:39.486 --> 00:14:44.809
education or what he sometimes
calls by the term philosophy.

00:14:44.809 --> 00:14:48.067
By philosophy,
he seems to suggest not so much

00:14:48.067 --> 00:14:51.759
the capacity for abstract or
speculative thought,

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:58.042
but rather a kind of liberal
education that he regards to be

00:14:58.042 --> 00:15:02.727
the preserve of what he calls by
the term the

00:15:02.727 --> 00:15:08.318
megalopsychos,
literally, the great-souled

00:15:08.318 --> 00:15:13.676
person or the great-souled man.
Mega, megalo,

00:15:13.676 --> 00:15:17.825
being our terms for great and
psychos,

00:15:17.825 --> 00:15:21.220
related to our word psyche,
soul.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.304
The great-souled person,
the great-souled man,

00:15:25.304 --> 00:15:28.299
the gentleman is,
in many ways,

00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:31.990
for Aristotle,
the ideal recipient of this

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.580
form of education,
of liberal education and also,

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.112
in some respect,
the ideal or perfect audience

00:15:40.112 --> 00:15:42.860
or readership of the book
itself.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:48.711
We can begin to see it is clear
how Aristotle's best regime

00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:53.957
differs from Plato's
intransigent demand for the rule

00:15:53.957 --> 00:15:58.426
of philosopher-kings.
The megalopsychos,

00:15:58.426 --> 00:16:01.073
the gentleman,
whatever else he is,

00:16:01.073 --> 00:16:04.500
is not a philosopher in the
strict sense.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.266
Sociologically,
Aristotle makes clear that the

00:16:08.266 --> 00:16:12.200
megalopsychos,
unlike the philosopher,

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:18.343
is a person of some inherited
wealth, chiefly landed property,

00:16:18.343 --> 00:16:22.169
but whose way of life will be
urban.

00:16:22.169 --> 00:16:26.769
He will be a member of what we
might call the urban patriciate.

00:16:26.769 --> 00:16:31.252
In the Nicomachean
Ethics, Aristotle provides

00:16:31.252 --> 00:16:36.349
us with a vivid list of the
psychological and even physical

00:16:36.349 --> 00:16:40.920
characteristics that such a
person must possess,

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.420
this megalopsychos.
Such a person,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:49.394
he says, exhibits a sort of
lofty detachment to the more or

00:16:49.394 --> 00:16:53.509
less petty things that weigh
most of us down.

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:58.543
Aristotle tells us he is slow
to act, unless something of

00:16:58.543 --> 00:17:04.352
great importance is at stake.
He repays favor with interest

00:17:04.352 --> 00:17:09.460
so as not to be under any
obligations to others.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.910
The gentleman,
he says, speaks his mind

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:17.268
without fear or favor,
somewhat like the New York

00:17:17.268 --> 00:17:22.079
Times, because to dissemble
would be beneath him.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:28.163
He may occasionally hurt
others, but this is not done out

00:17:28.163 --> 00:17:31.698
of deliberate cruelty.
In addition,

00:17:31.698 --> 00:17:35.877
Aristotle tells us such a
person will possess beautiful

00:17:35.877 --> 00:17:40.505
but useless things,
suggesting the possession not

00:17:40.505 --> 00:17:44.743
only of wealth,
but of a kind of cultivated

00:17:44.743 --> 00:17:48.637
aesthetic sense.
As if that weren't enough,

00:17:48.637 --> 00:17:52.669
Aristotle tells us that the
megalopsychos walks

00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:55.026
slowly,
because to hurry is

00:17:55.026 --> 00:17:59.310
undignified, is tall and speaks
with a deep voice.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:11.099
Very clear about who,
again, the ideal statesman or

00:18:11.099 --> 00:18:17.940
reader, potential statesman the
reader of this book would be.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.406
Most importantly,
you might say,

00:18:20.406 --> 00:18:24.463
what distinguishes the
gentleman as a class from the

00:18:24.463 --> 00:18:28.838
philosophers is a certain kind
of knowledge or practical

00:18:28.838 --> 00:18:32.848
intelligence.
The gentleman may lack the

00:18:32.848 --> 00:18:38.420
speculative intelligence of a
Socrates, but he will possess

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.359
that quality of practical
rationality,

00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:47.535
of practical judgment necessary
for the administration of

00:18:47.535 --> 00:18:50.804
affairs.
Aristotle calls this kind of

00:18:50.804 --> 00:18:54.320
knowledge, this kind of
practical judgment,

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.669
he calls it by the term
phronimos,

00:18:57.669 --> 00:19:03.085
that I have on the blackboard.
The person who possesses it is

00:19:03.085 --> 00:19:07.559
the phronimos,
a person of practical judgment.

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:12.873
Again, a term that captures
something of our meaning of

00:19:12.873 --> 00:19:16.119
common sense,
practical wisdom,

00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:21.975
the capacity for judging,
the capacity for judgment,

00:19:21.975 --> 00:19:27.400
which is not the same thing,
obviously, as speculative or

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.517
philosophic intelligence.
The phronimos is the

00:19:31.517 --> 00:19:36.579
person who is able to grasp the
fitting or the appropriate,

00:19:36.579 --> 00:19:41.257
the appropriate thing to do out
of the complex arrangements that

00:19:41.257 --> 00:19:45.294
make up any situation.
Above all, such a person

00:19:45.294 --> 00:19:51.212
embodies that special quality of
insight and discrimination that

00:19:51.212 --> 00:19:54.970
distinguishes him or her from
people,

00:19:54.970 --> 00:20:00.180
again, of more theoretical or
speculative cast of mind.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:04.150
How is this quality of
phronimos,

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.409
of judgment,
of practical wisdom,

00:20:07.409 --> 00:20:11.380
of horse sense,
how is it acquired?

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:21.234
Aristotle tells us that this
kind of knowledge is a kind of

00:20:21.234 --> 00:20:25.720
knowledge most appropriate to
politics.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:30.678
Again, it is neither--and he
wants to be clear about this--it

00:20:30.678 --> 00:20:34.727
is neither the theoretic
knowledge aimed simply at

00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:38.439
abstract truths,
nor is it the productive

00:20:38.439 --> 00:20:41.700
knowledge, what he calls
techne,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.592
the productive knowledge used
in the manufacture of useful

00:20:46.592 --> 00:20:49.509
artifacts.
What is it, then?

00:20:49.509 --> 00:20:55.886
It is a knowledge of how to act
where the purpose of action is

00:20:55.886 --> 00:21:00.414
acting well.
You might say it is less a body

00:21:00.414 --> 00:21:05.751
of true propositions than a
shrewd sense of know-how or

00:21:05.751 --> 00:21:07.630
political savvy.

00:21:10.829 --> 00:21:15.779
This kind of knowledge entails
judgment and deliberation,

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:20.109
the deliberative skill or the
deliberative art.

00:21:20.109 --> 00:21:23.247
We only deliberate,
Aristotle says,

00:21:23.247 --> 00:21:27.029
over things where there is some
choice.

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:31.079
We deliberate with an eye to
preservation or change,

00:21:31.079 --> 00:21:35.605
to making something better or
to preserve it from becoming

00:21:35.605 --> 00:21:38.874
worse.
This kind of knowledge will be

00:21:38.874 --> 00:21:43.163
the art or craft of the
statesman concerned above all

00:21:43.163 --> 00:21:46.710
with what to do in a specific
situation.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.820
It is the skill possessed by
the greatest statesmen,

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.772
you might say,
the fathers of the

00:21:51.772 --> 00:21:55.445
constitutions,
as it were, who create the

00:21:55.445 --> 00:22:01.289
permanent framework in which
allows later and lesser figures

00:22:01.289 --> 00:22:06.108
to handle change.
This is the kind of political

00:22:06.108 --> 00:22:10.024
skill and wisdom,
again, possessed of the

00:22:10.024 --> 00:22:14.527
founders of cities,
the legislative founders of

00:22:14.527 --> 00:22:18.972
regimes.
Aristotle's Politics is

00:22:18.972 --> 00:22:24.472
a book about the kind of
knowledge requisite for that

00:22:24.472 --> 00:22:28.970
kind of skill.
This quality of practical

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:33.614
judgment phronimos,
practical wisdom,

00:22:33.614 --> 00:22:37.561
was developed,
I think, in a beautiful essay,

00:22:37.561 --> 00:22:40.730
without any explicit reference
to Aristotle,

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:45.869
by the English political
philosopher Isaiah Berlin.

00:22:45.869 --> 00:22:48.860
Anyone here ever heard of
Isaiah Berlin?

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:53.492
Not one of you?
Famous, famous English

00:22:53.492 --> 00:22:58.980
philosopher, died a number of
years ago in the late ‘90s.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.407
This, I hope,
will be an inspiration to--you

00:23:02.407 --> 00:23:05.716
should read Isaiah Berlin.
In any case,

00:23:05.716 --> 00:23:09.754
he wrote a wonderful essay
called Political

00:23:09.754 --> 00:23:12.609
Judgment.
In it he asks,

00:23:12.609 --> 00:23:17.474
"What is the intellectual
quality that successful

00:23:17.474 --> 00:23:22.643
statesmen possess that
distinguishes their knowledge

00:23:22.643 --> 00:23:28.320
from all other forms of
rationality and knowledge?"

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.299
He writes as follows.
I'm going to quote him.

00:23:32.299 --> 00:23:36.579
"The quality that I am
attempting to describe is that

00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:39.789
special understanding of public
life,

00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:43.194
which successful statesmen
have, whether they are wicked or

00:23:43.194 --> 00:23:45.947
virtuous.
That which Bismark had or

00:23:45.947 --> 00:23:50.500
Talleyrand or Franklin Roosevelt
or, for that matter,

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:55.296
men such as Cavour or Disraeli,
Gladstone or Ataturk in common

00:23:55.296 --> 00:23:58.519
with the great psychological
novelists,

00:23:58.519 --> 00:24:02.211
and something which is
conspicuously lacking in men of

00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:07.325
more purely theoretical genius,
such as Newton or Einstein or

00:24:07.325 --> 00:24:11.561
Bertrand Russell or even Freud."
So there, too,

00:24:11.561 --> 00:24:14.582
like Aristotle,
he distinguishes a kind of

00:24:14.582 --> 00:24:18.339
practical skill possessed by the
greatest minds,

00:24:18.339 --> 00:24:22.564
political minds at least,
and says it's quite different

00:24:22.564 --> 00:24:27.180
and from what he calls the great
psychological novelists,

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.196
from that possessed of the
greatest philosophers and

00:24:31.196 --> 00:24:33.900
scientists.
"What are we to call this

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.460
capacity?"
Berlin continues.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.766
He writes, again, as follows.
"Practical reason,

00:24:40.766 --> 00:24:45.109
perhaps is a sense of what will
work and what will not.

00:24:45.109 --> 00:24:48.908
It is a capacity for synthesis
rather than analysis,

00:24:48.908 --> 00:24:52.930
for knowledge in the sense in
which trainers know their

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:56.803
animals or parents their
children or conductors their

00:24:56.803 --> 00:25:00.168
orchestras,
as opposed to that in which

00:25:00.168 --> 00:25:03.898
chemists know the contents of
their test tubes or

00:25:03.898 --> 00:25:07.940
mathematicians know the rules
their symbols obey.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.090
Those who lack this quality of
practical wisdom,

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.039
whatever other qualities they
may possess,

00:25:14.039 --> 00:25:16.864
no matter how clever,
learned, imaginative,

00:25:16.864 --> 00:25:19.487
kind, noble,
attractive, gifted in other

00:25:19.487 --> 00:25:24.305
ways they may be,
are correctly regarded as

00:25:24.305 --> 00:25:28.550
politically inept."
There, Berlin tells us

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:32.767
something about the character of
this political knowledge that

00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:35.740
Aristotle describes as
phronimos.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.000
Again, how is this knowledge
acquired?

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.701
Are we just born with it?
Do some people just have it or

00:25:42.701 --> 00:25:48.409
is it a product of experience?
Aristotle doesn't say,

00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:53.599
but I think the answer is
clearly some of both.

00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:56.809
It is a quality,
as I agree with Berlin,

00:25:56.809 --> 00:26:01.500
possessed by some of the great
psychological novelists.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.392
I mention the names of Tolstoy,
Henry James,

00:26:05.392 --> 00:26:08.470
and perhaps the greatest of
all,

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:13.253
Jane Austen,
if you want to know a novelist

00:26:13.253 --> 00:26:18.150
who employs this great skill of
judgment,

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.759
discrimination and practical
reason.

00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:23.509
It is also a virtue of great
statesmen.

00:26:23.509 --> 00:26:26.669
Principally,
Berlin mentions Bismark,

00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:31.930
Disraeli, Franklin Roosevelt.
I would also add the names of

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.910
Pericles, Lincoln,
and Churchill.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:38.920
Read their works.
Study their histories.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.996
They provide a virtual
education in statecraft,

00:26:42.996 --> 00:26:48.048
in how to negotiate affairs in
precisely the way Aristotle

00:26:48.048 --> 00:26:52.688
would have us do.
That leads me to the larger

00:26:52.688 --> 00:26:57.730
question, you might say,
which is posed throughout

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:02.972
Aristotle's work as a whole.
What is Aristotle's political

00:27:02.972 --> 00:27:05.050
science?
What is it for?

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:10.791
What is he attempting to do?
Already you could say to ask

00:27:10.791 --> 00:27:14.279
this question is to state a
claim.

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:18.660
Does Aristotle have a political
science, a science of politics?

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:24.808
Again, if so, what is it about?
To begin to answer this

00:27:24.808 --> 00:27:28.485
question, you might say even
begin to think about it in the

00:27:28.485 --> 00:27:31.240
right way,
requires that we stand back

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.316
from Aristotle's text for a
while and ask some fundamental

00:27:35.316 --> 00:27:39.251
questions about it.
What does Aristotle mean by the

00:27:39.251 --> 00:27:41.744
political?
What is the goal or purpose of

00:27:41.744 --> 00:27:44.556
the study of politics,
and what is distinctive about

00:27:44.556 --> 00:27:47.700
Aristotle's approach to the
study of political things?

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.678
Today, the term "political
science" stands for one among a

00:27:57.678 --> 00:28:02.667
number of different disciplines
that we call collectively the

00:28:02.667 --> 00:28:06.205
social sciences.
This not only includes

00:28:06.205 --> 00:28:08.932
political science,
but economics,

00:28:08.932 --> 00:28:13.450
sociology, anthropology,
psychology, among others.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:17.485
Each of these disciplines seeks
to give us a handle on a

00:28:17.485 --> 00:28:21.299
distinctive set of human actions
and interactions.

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:24.488
Economics deals with the
transactions involving the

00:28:24.488 --> 00:28:27.039
production and distribution of
wealth,

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:31.781
sociology with the transaction
governing status and class,

00:28:31.781 --> 00:28:36.190
anthropology with the domain of
culture, and so on.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:41.436
What is it that political
science studies and what is its

00:28:41.436 --> 00:28:44.809
relation to the other
disciplines?

00:28:44.809 --> 00:28:50.082
The core of political science,
at least according to Aristotle

00:28:50.082 --> 00:28:54.490
and to this degree I'm very much
an Aristotelian,

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:59.061
what distinguishes it from all
other studies is the concept of

00:28:59.061 --> 00:29:01.759
the regime, of the
politea.

00:29:01.759 --> 00:29:05.208
The regime, for him,
is not one branch of human

00:29:05.208 --> 00:29:09.182
activity among others,
it is the fundamental principle

00:29:09.182 --> 00:29:14.130
or ordering principle that makes
all the others even possible.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:18.939
This is why Aristotle does not
regard the study of politics as

00:29:18.939 --> 00:29:23.991
one social science among others.
It is rather what he calls the

00:29:23.991 --> 00:29:28.656
master science that determines
the rank and place of all the

00:29:28.656 --> 00:29:32.494
others within the polity.
His study of the regime,

00:29:32.494 --> 00:29:36.488
that is to say the underlying
constitutional principles that

00:29:36.488 --> 00:29:40.346
govern each order is what
distinguishes Aristotle from the

00:29:40.346 --> 00:29:44.250
other social scientists.
When you came into this class

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:47.797
in the beginning of the
semester, you may have thought

00:29:47.797 --> 00:29:51.880
you were just signing up for a
class in political science.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.513
You did not know,
perhaps, that you were coming

00:29:55.513 --> 00:30:00.332
in to study what he calls "the
master science," the science of

00:30:00.332 --> 00:30:04.611
sciences," in some respects.
It is that priority that

00:30:04.611 --> 00:30:08.552
Aristotle attributes to the
regime that I think is what

00:30:08.552 --> 00:30:12.567
distinguishes his kind of
political science from that of

00:30:12.567 --> 00:30:15.308
today.
Today, you might say political

00:30:15.308 --> 00:30:18.668
scientists and social
scientists, they're more modest

00:30:18.668 --> 00:30:22.740
in ascribing priority to any
particular branch of knowledge.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.136
With, I should say,
the possible exception of the

00:30:26.136 --> 00:30:30.027
economists, who often will
believe that economic motives

00:30:30.027 --> 00:30:34.910
and transactions provide the key
to all possible human behaviors.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:40.769
Who knows, maybe they're right,
but Aristotle would deny it.

00:30:40.769 --> 00:30:43.996
For Aristotle,
however, politics has a

00:30:43.996 --> 00:30:48.529
priority to all the others,
because as he has argued,

00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:53.802
man is the political animal.
To be a political animal means

00:30:53.802 --> 00:30:57.940
first to possess speech or
reason that allows us to

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.989
participate in a community or a
way of life governed by shared

00:31:02.989 --> 00:31:06.299
standards of justice and
injustice.

00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:10.428
Aristotle's political science
presupposes, in other words,

00:31:10.428 --> 00:31:14.847
a certain conception of human
beings as linguistic animals who

00:31:14.847 --> 00:31:19.338
are capable not only of living
together--so do a range of other

00:31:19.338 --> 00:31:23.829
species--but rather sharing in
the arrangements of rule.

00:31:23.829 --> 00:31:27.173
It is our logos,
our reason that makes a

00:31:27.173 --> 00:31:30.880
community possible and also
expresses or creates,

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.358
you could say,
a certain latitude or

00:31:35.358 --> 00:31:42.267
indeterminacy in how our
behavior distinguishes us from

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:45.677
other species.
It is precisely,

00:31:45.677 --> 00:31:48.169
he believes,
this latitude that makes

00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:52.321
political communities not only
sites of agreement over shared

00:31:52.321 --> 00:31:54.996
standards,
but also, as he says,

00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:59.359
sites of moral contestation
over justice and injustice.

00:31:59.359 --> 00:32:04.539
Politics is about conflict and
conflicts over justice.

00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:09.586
To be a political animal,
for him, is to engage or to be

00:32:09.586 --> 00:32:14.632
engaged in this ongoing
conversation and debate over the

00:32:14.632 --> 00:32:19.298
very nature of justice,
to refuse to participate in

00:32:19.298 --> 00:32:23.190
that conversation,
to declare oneself an outsider

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:26.446
to it,
he says, is either to be below

00:32:26.446 --> 00:32:30.688
humanity or above it.
To be human is to be part of

00:32:30.688 --> 00:32:32.310
that conversation.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:42.932
The centrality Aristotle
ascribes to politics forces us

00:32:42.932 --> 00:32:48.047
to consider another question,
namely what is the purpose of

00:32:48.047 --> 00:32:51.650
this study?
Why do we engage in it?

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:56.686
At first glance,
this seems to be overwhelmingly

00:32:56.686 --> 00:33:03.022
obvious--to gain more knowledge.
But knowledge of what and for

00:33:03.022 --> 00:33:05.974
what?
Most people today are attracted

00:33:05.974 --> 00:33:10.687
to the study of politics because
they are interested in things

00:33:10.687 --> 00:33:14.549
they've read about in newspapers
or seen on TV.

00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:17.764
Things like elections,
political leaders and parties,

00:33:17.764 --> 00:33:21.349
different causes to which they
may feel some attraction,

00:33:21.349 --> 00:33:25.639
interested in wars and
revolutions that they see or

00:33:25.639 --> 00:33:29.343
have heard about.
It is to learn more about these

00:33:29.343 --> 00:33:32.420
things that we come to the study
of politics.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:37.029
It's as true now as it was in
the time of Aristotle.

00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:41.079
Aristotle certainly recognized
that the accumulation of

00:33:41.079 --> 00:33:44.621
political knowledge,
you might say the gathering of

00:33:44.621 --> 00:33:47.900
data, the organization of facts,
is very important.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.410
Books III, IV,
V of the Politics shows

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:55.000
the empirical side of
Aristotle's politics.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.570
Again, let me just pose the
question.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:01.695
What is this knowledge for?
What does Aristotle intend to

00:34:01.695 --> 00:34:04.700
do with it or want us to do with
it?

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.404
Politics, political science,
he tells us in the

00:34:08.404 --> 00:34:12.510
Ethics again,
is not a theoretical subject in

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:17.019
the matter of physics or
metaphysics or mathematics.

00:34:17.019 --> 00:34:20.577
That is to say,
its purpose is not knowledge

00:34:20.577 --> 00:34:23.967
for its own sake.
However important the study of

00:34:23.967 --> 00:34:26.692
politics may be,
it exists not for the sake of

00:34:26.692 --> 00:34:28.821
knowledge,
but for action,

00:34:28.821 --> 00:34:32.575
as he tells us,
for praxis, is his word for

00:34:32.575 --> 00:34:35.292
action.
Political science exists for

00:34:35.292 --> 00:34:39.002
the sake of the human good and
the opening sentence of the

00:34:39.002 --> 00:34:42.594
Politics confirms this.
He says, we see,

00:34:42.594 --> 00:34:48.099
everyone does everything for
the sake of some apparent good.

00:34:48.099 --> 00:34:55.471
All action, all human behavior
is aimed at achieving some type

00:34:55.471 --> 00:35:01.286
of good, is all aimed at action.
All political action aims at

00:35:01.286 --> 00:35:03.957
preservation or change.
When we act,

00:35:03.957 --> 00:35:07.380
we seek to preserve or to
change.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.987
All political action,
you might say,

00:35:09.987 --> 00:35:13.190
is guided by the idea of better
or worse.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:18.713
It implies a standard of better
and worse and this implies some

00:35:18.713 --> 00:35:22.010
idea of the good by which we
judge.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:24.860
So it follows,
at least Aristotle believes so,

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.139
that the study of politics is
not,

00:35:27.139 --> 00:35:31.043
again, for the sake of
knowledge for its own sake,

00:35:31.043 --> 00:35:34.150
but knowledge that serves the
regime.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:38.150
It helps to make it better or
prevent it from becoming worse.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:42.460
Its goal is not just to know
more, but to know how and this

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.210
requires not only theoretic
acumen,

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:50.024
but political judgment and the
kind of practical knowledge that

00:35:50.024 --> 00:35:52.510
Aristotle discusses at length.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:36:00.220
This quality of practical
judgment and reflection is,

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:04.760
again, somehow unique to the
political art or the political

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.080
skill Aristotle tells us.
It is the ability not only to

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.828
keep the ship of state afloat,
but allows the greatest

00:36:12.828 --> 00:36:17.747
statesmen to guide the ship,
to steer it safely to port,

00:36:17.747 --> 00:36:22.696
that is to say the kind of
knowledge needed by the

00:36:22.696 --> 00:36:26.794
statesmen.
Aristotle's political science,

00:36:26.794 --> 00:36:31.900
then, is ultimately the supreme
science of statecraft,

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:38.340
a term that again we don't hear
much about--statecraft or

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.498
statesmanship.
It's regarded perhaps by

00:36:42.498 --> 00:36:48.486
today's political science as too
value laden, too subjective to

00:36:48.486 --> 00:36:52.349
speak of statesmanship or
statecraft.

00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:54.894
This, too again,
is a word that carries

00:36:54.894 --> 00:36:57.440
distinctive and strong
connotations.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.467
Who is a statesman?
What are the attributes of the

00:37:01.467 --> 00:37:04.264
statesman?
I've spoken a little about the

00:37:04.264 --> 00:37:07.853
attributes that Aristotle
believes are essential to the

00:37:07.853 --> 00:37:11.510
megalopsychos,
the greatest of the statesmen.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:14.409
This will be quite different,
for example,

00:37:14.409 --> 00:37:18.512
from the qualities we will see
beginning on Friday and next

00:37:18.512 --> 00:37:22.190
week that Machiavelli and later
Hobbes or Locke,

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:27.920
believe are necessary for the
great founders or statesmen.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.638
Plato and Aristotle give their
own vision--the

00:37:31.638 --> 00:37:34.944
philosopher-king,
the great-souled man or

00:37:34.944 --> 00:37:38.571
megalopsychos.
But the statesman,

00:37:38.571 --> 00:37:43.254
again, to the highest degree is
the founder of regimes,

00:37:43.254 --> 00:37:49.195
laws, and institutions.
They provide the constitutional

00:37:49.195 --> 00:37:53.952
framework within which we,
later figures,

00:37:53.952 --> 00:37:57.384
operate.
So if Aristotle's political

00:37:57.384 --> 00:38:00.610
science is an education for
statesmanship,

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.599
you might say what are its
methods?

00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:07.130
What are its distinctive
methods?

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:14.185
How do we educate a statesman?
How do we educate potential

00:38:14.185 --> 00:38:17.039
statesmen?
What are its methods?

00:38:17.039 --> 00:38:19.679
This is a question asked,
you might say,

00:38:19.679 --> 00:38:23.453
of every mature science.
It is possession of a method

00:38:23.453 --> 00:38:27.622
that distinguishes a mature
science from simply a jumble of

00:38:27.622 --> 00:38:30.438
facts,
hearsay, inspired guesses,

00:38:30.438 --> 00:38:34.860
or a random collection of
insights and observations.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.860
Without a distinctive method
for obtaining and organizing

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.360
knowledge, we are all just
groping in the dark.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.185
So what is the distinctive
method of Aristotle's

00:38:46.185 --> 00:38:49.427
Politics?
To some degree,

00:38:49.427 --> 00:38:55.590
Aristotle refuses to play the
methodologist's game.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:58.492
In a well-known passage from
the Ethics,

00:38:58.492 --> 00:39:02.151
he says that our discussion
will be adequate if it achieves

00:39:02.151 --> 00:39:04.989
clarity within the limits of its
subject.

00:39:04.989 --> 00:39:08.239
If it achieves clarity within
the limits of its subject.

00:39:08.239 --> 00:39:11.331
In other words,
he seems to be saying it is

00:39:11.331 --> 00:39:15.306
wrong to demand methodological
purity in a subject like

00:39:15.306 --> 00:39:18.766
politics where there is always
great variety and

00:39:18.766 --> 00:39:21.532
unpredictability.
It is the mark,

00:39:21.532 --> 00:39:25.964
he says, of an educated person,
presumably a liberally educated

00:39:25.964 --> 00:39:29.681
person, not to demand more
precision than the subject

00:39:29.681 --> 00:39:32.601
matter allows.
But that formulation seems,

00:39:32.601 --> 00:39:34.800
in many ways,
to be question begging.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.060
How much precision does the
subject allow?

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:42.111
How do we know?
There will always,

00:39:42.111 --> 00:39:44.648
he suggests,
appear to be something ad

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:48.389
hoc about the methods used
in the study of politics.

00:39:48.389 --> 00:39:51.506
We will have to let the method
fit the subject,

00:39:51.506 --> 00:39:55.098
rather than demanding the
subject matter fit a kind of

00:39:55.098 --> 00:39:58.818
apriori method.
To insist on that kind of

00:39:58.818 --> 00:40:02.892
methodological purity,
he implies, would be to impose

00:40:02.892 --> 00:40:07.301
a false sense of unity,
a false sense of certainty or

00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:12.127
absoluteness on the study of
politics, which is variable and

00:40:12.127 --> 00:40:16.380
contingent and always subject to
flux and change.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:20.314
Even while Aristotle may deny
that there is a single method

00:40:20.314 --> 00:40:22.960
appropriate to the study of
politics,

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.428
he proposes a set of common
questions that political

00:40:27.428 --> 00:40:31.959
scientists have to address.
He lays out these questions at

00:40:31.959 --> 00:40:36.070
the very beginning of the fourth
book of the Politics.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:40.239
He lists four such questions.
The political scientist,

00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:43.690
he says, must have a grasp of
the best regime,

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:46.909
given the most favorable
circumstances.

00:40:46.909 --> 00:40:50.210
Second, he tells us,
the political scientist must

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:54.061
consider what kind of regime
will be best under less than

00:40:54.061 --> 00:40:58.934
optimal circumstances.
Third, the political scientist

00:40:58.934 --> 00:41:04.281
must have some knowledge of how
to render any regime,

00:41:04.281 --> 00:41:10.760
no matter how imperfect it may
be, more stable and coherent.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.561
Finally, the political
scientist must know something

00:41:14.561 --> 00:41:18.139
about the techniques of reform
and persuasion,

00:41:18.139 --> 00:41:23.067
what we might call the area of
political rhetoric by which

00:41:23.067 --> 00:41:27.650
existing regimes can be brought
closer to the best.

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:31.379
Taken together,
these four questions are

00:41:31.379 --> 00:41:36.829
intended to guide inquiry,
to shape and direct inquiry.

00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:41.150
They are not intended to yield
sure or certain results,

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:45.309
but to guide and inform
statesmen and citizens in the

00:41:45.309 --> 00:41:47.870
business of decision-making.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.651
Bearing in mind that political
science is a practical science,

00:41:54.651 --> 00:41:59.045
a science of judgment,
a science aimed at directing

00:41:59.045 --> 00:42:04.480
action under specific
circumstances and situations,

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.255
it is important,
Aristotle finally suggests,

00:42:08.255 --> 00:42:13.699
that the language of political
science express the common sense

00:42:13.699 --> 00:42:17.650
or ordinary language of
political actors.

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:24.559
There is virtually no jargon in
Aristotle's Politics.

00:42:24.559 --> 00:42:30.137
Aristotle's political science
stays entirely within the orbit

00:42:30.137 --> 00:42:34.639
of ordinary speech.
Such language does not claim to

00:42:34.639 --> 00:42:39.162
be scientifically purged of
ambiguity, but rather adopts

00:42:39.162 --> 00:42:43.604
standards of proof appropriate
to people in debates and

00:42:43.604 --> 00:42:46.304
assemblies,
in courts of law,

00:42:46.304 --> 00:42:51.307
in council rooms and the like.
The language of Aristotelian

00:42:51.307 --> 00:42:54.846
political science is the
language of man,

00:42:54.846 --> 00:42:59.054
the political animal.
You will never hear him

00:42:59.054 --> 00:43:04.219
speaking in terms of dependent
or independent variables.

00:43:04.219 --> 00:43:07.802
You will never hear him using
technical jargon,

00:43:07.802 --> 00:43:12.630
artificially imported into the
science of politics or the study

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:15.200
of politics from the outside.

00:43:18.869 --> 00:43:22.664
What most distinguishes
Aristotle is that his language

00:43:22.664 --> 00:43:26.530
is addressed emphatically to
citizens and statesmen,

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:32.290
not to other political
scientists or philosophers.

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:37.310
It has a public orientation.
It is publicly directed.

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:42.079
It is public spirited.
It is concerned with the common

00:43:42.079 --> 00:43:44.705
good.
Contrast that with today's

00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:46.200
political science.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:53.364
Today, it seems,
political scientists are more

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:58.524
concerned with advancing the
abstract truths of science and

00:43:58.524 --> 00:44:03.151
claims about creating a
methodologically rigorous and

00:44:03.151 --> 00:44:07.405
pure science of politics,
where Aristotle is more

00:44:07.405 --> 00:44:09.160
concerned with the regime.

00:44:12.289 --> 00:44:15.273
Modern political science,
in many ways,

00:44:15.273 --> 00:44:19.119
claims to stand above or apart
from the regime,

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:22.787
to be objective,
to be disinterested,

00:44:22.787 --> 00:44:28.900
as if it were viewing human
affairs from a distant planet.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.221
Aristotle takes his stand from
within politics and the regime

00:44:33.221 --> 00:44:36.875
of which he is a part.
Of course, we all know

00:44:36.875 --> 00:44:41.340
contemporary political
scientists are not neutral.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.055
They frequently insert their
views, values we call them,

00:44:45.055 --> 00:44:49.552
value judgments we call them.
They insert them into their

00:44:49.552 --> 00:44:52.418
discussions.
These values are regarded by

00:44:52.418 --> 00:44:55.894
them as purely subjective,
again, their own value judgment

00:44:55.894 --> 00:44:58.767
so to speak,
and not strictly speaking a

00:44:58.767 --> 00:45:02.252
part of the science of politics.
But we all know,

00:45:02.252 --> 00:45:05.119
do we not, that most
contemporary political

00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:09.890
scientists tend to be liberals.
Their values are liberal values.

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:14.287
This raises a question.
Whether the relation between

00:45:14.287 --> 00:45:17.581
contemporary political science
and liberalism is merely

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:20.570
accidental or whether there is
some intrinsic,

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:26.739
some necessary connection
between them.

00:45:26.739 --> 00:45:31.975
One might do well to ponder
which political science is

00:45:31.975 --> 00:45:35.730
really more
scientific--Aristotle's,

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:40.139
which is explicitly and
necessarily evaluative and that

00:45:40.139 --> 00:45:45.365
offers advice and exhortation to
the statesmen and citizens about

00:45:45.365 --> 00:45:49.790
how to care for their regime,
or contemporary political

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:53.320
science that claims to be
neutral and nonpartisan,

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.529
but which smuggles its values
and preferences in always

00:45:57.529 --> 00:46:04.307
through the back door.
On this very partisan note I

00:46:04.307 --> 00:46:08.337
conclude.
On Friday, let me just remind

00:46:08.337 --> 00:46:12.000
you, Il Principe.
We'll study Machiavelli.

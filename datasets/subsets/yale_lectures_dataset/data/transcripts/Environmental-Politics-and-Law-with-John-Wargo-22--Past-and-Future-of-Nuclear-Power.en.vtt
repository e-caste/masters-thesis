00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.920
So today, I want to explore the
problem that we face,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.164
which is much more than a
dilemma, it's a quad-lemma in a

00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:10.926
way,
or a quint-lemma of how we

00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:16.637
manage our future energy demands
and how we invest our resources

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:19.720
in alternative forms of energy.
 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.353
And I'm going to spend most of
this session talking about the

00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:26.320
possibilities and limitations of
nuclear power.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.469
And this will provide a
foundation for the lecture on

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:33.581
next Tuesday,
which will be particularly

00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:37.810
directed at wind,
but more broadly at renewables.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.825
So first, I'd like to have you
consider the distribution of

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:45.563
nuclear power plants in the
world and really reflect on

00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:49.956
where they're not located,
and their high concentration,

00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:53.470
particularly in the Eastern,
Midwestern part of the United

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.590
States,
but also in Europe.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.070
So within the U.S.
 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.768
you see that they're really
concentrated up in the

00:01:00.768 --> 00:01:04.239
Northeast, but also south in
nearby Chicago.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.765
And California is quite
striking in that in 1976 the

00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:11.843
State of California enacted a
moratorium against new nuclear

00:01:11.843 --> 00:01:13.780
power plant development.
 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.560
If you look more closely at
Europe,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.397
and particularly at France,
you can see a very high

00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:24.691
dependence in some nations in
the European Union on nuclear

00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:25.260
power.
 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.224
France now receives
approximately seventy-five

00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:31.060
percent of its power from
nuclear plants.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.894
And inside the United States,
also there's quite a bit of

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.430
variability in reliance on
nuclear.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.739
So in Connecticut,
for example,

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:44.361
nearly sixty-five percent of
the power that we consume in the

00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:48.060
state comes from nuclear plants
in Niantic,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.777
which is about forty-five miles
to the east of us on the Thames

00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:56.430
River from the Millstone nuclear
power plants.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.549
So it's quite curious how
different parts of the country,

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.230
different economies,
have treated nuclear power.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.093
And explaining the cultural
predisposition to accept the

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:12.030
risks and accept the costs is
not an easy thing to do.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.849
So just so you have an overview
of the status of the nuclear

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.631
industry in the world,
there are about 436 different

00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:24.030
reactors that are operating in
thirty different countries.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.887
Fifty reactors are now under
construction,

00:02:26.887 --> 00:02:28.699
mostly in Asian nations.
 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.353
And within the U.S.,
there are proposals for twenty

00:02:32.353 --> 00:02:33.449
new reactors.
 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.864
And of these,
four to eight may be online in

00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:37.419
2020.
 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.482
China has eleven online at
present, with twenty-two under

00:02:40.482 --> 00:02:42.888
construction,
and is the nation where nuclear

00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:45.240
development is most rapid in the
world.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.956
Within the U.S.,
the operating licenses that

00:02:48.956 --> 00:02:54.059
have had limits placed on them
of operating licenses between

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:58.514
thirty and forty years,
most of these are going to be

00:02:58.514 --> 00:03:00.620
granted operating extensions.
 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.806
And the concern was that the
plant or the infrastructure

00:03:03.806 --> 00:03:07.457
would not have the capability of
lasting longer than forty years

00:03:07.457 --> 00:03:08.560
at the outside.
 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.105
But they're finding that the
engineering integrity of many of

00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:15.240
the plants is higher than they
thought it might be.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.270
But this basically is a
short-term lease on the problem

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.823
of decommissioning these nuclear
plants and also what we'll be

00:03:23.823 --> 00:03:28.253
talking about in a few moments,
which will be the problem of

00:03:28.253 --> 00:03:29.750
managing nuclear waste.
 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.190
The MIT report,
the faculty report that was

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.104
issued in 2003 and then recently
updated that we asked you to

00:03:38.104 --> 00:03:42.119
read has some really I think
important lessons and

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.150
conclusions embedded within it.
 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.818
So they concluded that after
five years from 2003,

00:03:47.818 --> 00:03:50.078
so this is two years ago,
no new plants are under

00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:51.818
construction in the United
States,

00:03:51.818 --> 00:03:54.800
and insufficient progress has
been made on waste management.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.156
The sober warning is that if
more is not done,

00:03:57.156 --> 00:04:00.247
nuclear power will diminish as
a practical and timely option

00:04:00.247 --> 00:04:02.288
for climate change risk
mitigation.

00:04:02.288 --> 00:04:07.120
So as one thinks about what are
options are,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.039
particularly coal,
as opposed to investments in

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.603
renewables,
as opposed to investments in

00:04:12.603 --> 00:04:15.568
nuclear power,
one might think about it as a

00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:17.370
problem of relative cost.
 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.333
But you also might think about
relative risk and ease of

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:25.225
bringing additional capacity
online given the different

00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:26.089
sources.
 

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:30.997
And underlying this,
I think, is an underestimated

00:04:30.997 --> 00:04:34.990
cultural factor,
which is what we worry about in

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.007
the United States,
and our predisposition to

00:04:39.007 --> 00:04:43.747
remember not just Chernobyl,
but also what happened at Three

00:04:43.747 --> 00:04:44.790
Mile Island in 1979.
 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.596
The capital costs of
constructing a new plant are

00:04:49.596 --> 00:04:51.300
often enormous.
 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.180
And because so much can go
wrong, including construction

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.271
delays that can cause interest
rates to rise and the amount

00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:02.870
that has to be paid back to
investors to rise,

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.651
it's caused what's thought of
as a risks premium being put on

00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:08.040
an investment funds.
 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.838
So banks or private investment
companies often will loan the

00:05:12.838 --> 00:05:17.879
money to a utility company that
wants to build a new plant,

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.206
but they will do so at a higher
rate when it's measured by

00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:22.139
kilowatt hour.
 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.774
And so there's about a two cent
per kilowatt hour difference

00:05:26.774 --> 00:05:30.860
between nuclear compared to coal
and natural gas,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.949
which makes this a very,
very expensive proposition.

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.779
Basically, the money costs more.
 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:42.216
The legal and regulatory
structure that surrounds nuclear

00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:44.740
power is rather complex.
 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.536
The initial statute that
governed what now exists was the

00:05:48.536 --> 00:05:52.605
Atomic Energy Act back in 1954
that we discussed a bit during

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:56.064
the beginning of the term when
we were talking about

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.370
atmospheric weapons testing.
 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.459
But now, recall that the
technology,

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:03.404
that the science and
engineering foundation for

00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:05.834
nuclear power plants,
really evolved out of the

00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:07.930
nuclear weapons development
program.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.745
So many of the nuclear power
plants that were the earliest

00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:16.500
versions,
say at Hanford or at Oakridge

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.490
in Tennessee,
these plants were first

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.661
generation,
but they were designed

00:06:21.661 --> 00:06:24.459
predominantly to provide
enriched fuel for atomic

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:25.100
weapons.
 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.346
This defines both state and
federal authority concerning

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:29.350
nuclear energy.
 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.043
And it really was the watershed
that ended the monopoly,

00:06:34.043 --> 00:06:38.139
the government monopoly on
nuclear technology.

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.449
And it gave the private sector
a role in nuclear development,

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:46.440
and expressly prohibited states
from any role in transfer,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.096
delivery, receipt,
acquisition,

00:06:48.096 --> 00:06:51.589
possession,
or use of nuclear materials.

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:55.119
And it also gave the Atomic
Energy Commission the exclusive

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:57.250
authority to manage these
issues.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.584
What is interesting about the
history of the AEC is that they

00:07:01.584 --> 00:07:06.064
were both the promoters of the
technology and the developers of

00:07:06.064 --> 00:07:08.889
the technology,
and they were supposed to be

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:09.680
the regulators.
 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.480
So the fox watching the
henhouse, so to speak.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:20.360
And this was recognized quite
early in the history of the AEC,

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.918
when Congress decided to break
off the responsibilities

00:07:23.918 --> 00:07:27.675
associated with regulation to
have a higher probability of

00:07:27.675 --> 00:07:31.500
safety and environmental
protection and worker safety.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.605
So that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission was given these

00:07:34.605 --> 00:07:35.660
responsibilities.
 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.949
So this is an independent
agency now that has

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:43.360
commissioners assigned to it
that make choices about issuing

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.024
licensing decisions and about
safety violations or

00:07:47.024 --> 00:07:51.509
environmental violations
associated with the industry.

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:55.148
So that states have retained
authority over electric power

00:07:55.148 --> 00:07:57.509
generation, sale,
and transmission.

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:00.824
Another aspect of the
development of the nuclear

00:08:00.824 --> 00:08:05.055
industry which is important to
know is that this is not being

00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:08.230
protected by private insurance
companies.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.004
The Price Anderson Nuclear
Industries Indemnity Act really

00:08:12.004 --> 00:08:16.177
holds the industry harmless from
damage claims in the event of a

00:08:16.177 --> 00:08:17.569
serious accident.
 

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:21.103
And it also sets up a procedure
for compensation that has

00:08:21.103 --> 00:08:23.689
criteria that are really pretty
clear,

00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:27.860
that those that claim damage
have to show what it was,

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.259
they have to calculate their
monetary loss,

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:34.399
and they also have to
demonstrate causality that is

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:38.952
relatively easy to demonstrate
in this case because of a

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:43.422
specific isotope mixture
signature that would come from

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:47.808
any sort of a nuclear explosion
or an accident.

00:08:47.808 --> 00:08:53.048
So the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission was created in 1974.

00:08:53.048 --> 00:08:57.321
Now, you can imagine also that
many states might be more

00:08:57.321 --> 00:09:01.048
worried about nuclear power than
other states.

00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:03.440
And California is really a
pretty good example of that.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.802
So that in 1976,
the State of California created

00:09:06.802 --> 00:09:10.740
a moratorium on new nuclear
power plant construction.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.408
So states might have the
authority to do that.

00:09:14.408 --> 00:09:17.552
And until the federal
government approved of methods

00:09:17.552 --> 00:09:21.452
to dispose of high level waste,
the State of California was

00:09:21.452 --> 00:09:25.328
really quite concerned about
what the long-term costs might

00:09:25.328 --> 00:09:29.239
be to manage that waste,
and also what the long-term

00:09:29.239 --> 00:09:33.620
costs might be associated with
decommissioning the plant.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.186
So the Pacific Gas and Electric
Company argued that the

00:09:37.186 --> 00:09:41.280
Congressional intent to preempt
state regulation of the nuclear

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.649
industry was implicit in the
Atomic Energy Act.

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:48.697
So again, preemption is a
critical legal tool that the

00:09:48.697 --> 00:09:52.899
industry relied upon in order to
claim that the State of

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:56.490
California did not have
authority to create this

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.788
moratorium.
 

00:09:57.788 --> 00:10:00.913
So the Supreme Court eventually
ruled on this case,

00:10:00.913 --> 00:10:03.350
and its finding is quite
interesting.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.615
The federal government
possesses exclusive regulatory

00:10:06.615 --> 00:10:10.506
authority over construction and
operation of nuclear facilities

00:10:10.506 --> 00:10:12.580
and over radiological safety.
 

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.514
And the states hold authority
over decisions concerning the

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:18.145
need for additional generating
facilities, licensing,

00:10:18.145 --> 00:10:20.120
ratemaking, land use,
and planning.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.448
And the Supreme Court argued
that federal law would preempt

00:10:23.448 --> 00:10:26.549
the moratorium if it was related
to safety concerns.

00:10:26.549 --> 00:10:28.649
So that's an interesting idea.
 

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:32.303
The federal government would be
the experts in the area of risk

00:10:32.303 --> 00:10:34.779
assessment and environmental
assessment.

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:36.620
Thank you, Emily Jack-Scott.
 

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.538
You seem to have been quite
successful, persuasive.

00:10:40.538 --> 00:10:44.940
So that if it's related to
safety concerns,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.682
the court argued that
California did not have the

00:10:47.682 --> 00:10:50.484
authority to establish a
moratorium because it was

00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:53.798
worried about health effects or
environmental dangers.

00:10:53.798 --> 00:10:57.061
But it concluded that the
federal law would not preempt a

00:10:57.061 --> 00:11:00.440
moratorium if California's logic
was based on economics.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.582
So if they were worried about
cost considerations down the

00:11:03.582 --> 00:11:03.970
road.
 

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.894
So a very interesting
distinction that allowed this

00:11:07.894 --> 00:11:10.168
moratorium to be sustained.
 

00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:14.303
California's assertion that the
legislature had enacted the

00:11:14.303 --> 00:11:18.082
moratorium based upon economic
concerns was eventually

00:11:18.082 --> 00:11:19.009
accepted.
 

00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:24.418
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982 is important because most

00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:29.562
nuclear waste had been and is
now being stored in or nearby

00:11:29.562 --> 00:11:31.778
nuclear power plants.
 

00:11:31.778 --> 00:11:34.039
So it's highly dispersed around
the country.

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:35.750
Think back on the U.S.
 

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.717
map that I showed you with the
different dots of the location

00:11:38.717 --> 00:11:39.509
of the plants.
 

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:42.519
That's where the nuclear spent
fuel, the fuel rods,

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:45.408
that are highly radioactive,
are being stored.

00:11:45.408 --> 00:11:48.547
Within Connecticut,
this would include the Haddam

00:11:48.547 --> 00:11:52.404
Neck Nuclear Power Plant that's
now been closed that's about

00:11:52.404 --> 00:11:55.019
twenty miles from Yale to the
east,

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:58.654
and it would also include the
three Millstone plants over in

00:11:58.654 --> 00:11:59.269
Niantic.
 

00:11:59.269 --> 00:12:03.878
So that under this statute,
the Department of Energy was

00:12:03.878 --> 00:12:08.738
granted the authority to begin
to centralize a nuclear fuel

00:12:08.738 --> 00:12:11.418
reprocessing and repository.
 

00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:14.788
So basically,
just a storage facility where

00:12:14.788 --> 00:12:19.600
this waste could be handled
until it might be reprocessed.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.518
But they were unable to open
the facility,

00:12:23.518 --> 00:12:28.296
and by an amendment,
the site at Yucca Mountain was

00:12:28.296 --> 00:12:33.168
established by DOE to be the
single repository.

00:12:33.168 --> 00:12:35.770
So you can imagine that if you
were the State of Nevada,

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.090
you probably would not be too
happy about that.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.100
But if you were the State of
California,

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.048
Connecticut,
or any other state that had

00:12:43.048 --> 00:12:45.832
nuclear power plants,
you'd be really happy about the

00:12:45.832 --> 00:12:49.000
prospect of getting rid of the
waste that's sitting inside your

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.918
state boundary.
 

00:12:49.918 --> 00:12:53.158
So this prompted a lot of
litigation.

00:12:53.158 --> 00:12:57.355
Litigation on the part of
Nevada, that did not want the

00:12:57.355 --> 00:12:59.918
repository to be located there.
 

00:12:59.918 --> 00:13:02.149
And litigation on the part of
other states,

00:13:02.149 --> 00:13:04.070
including the State of
Washington, most recently,

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.635
arguing that they wanted their
waste taken to this power plant

00:13:08.635 --> 00:13:12.303
and that the Obama
administration did not have the

00:13:12.303 --> 00:13:16.196
right to decide that this
storage facility should not

00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:17.019
open.
 

00:13:17.019 --> 00:13:21.018
When one thinks about the
location of either the plants or

00:13:21.018 --> 00:13:24.524
the storage facilities,
you need to think carefully

00:13:24.524 --> 00:13:26.908
about evacuation requirements.
 

00:13:26.908 --> 00:13:31.549
So before the Three Mile Island
accident in Pennsylvania,

00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:37.019
the emergency response plans by
nuclear power plants in the U.S.

00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:37.928
were voluntary.
 

00:13:37.928 --> 00:13:41.288
That's quite striking,
given what the Atomic Energy

00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:45.182
Commission and the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission understood

00:13:45.182 --> 00:13:48.878
about the potential for these
nuclides to move over long

00:13:48.878 --> 00:13:51.908
distances,
being transported in the air.

00:13:51.908 --> 00:13:56.370
Now, the plans have to cover a
ten-mile radius.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.389
Now think about that.
 

00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:59.879
Ten miles, would that be
sufficient?

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:02.855
Well, we're about twenty miles
from the nearest nuclear power

00:14:02.855 --> 00:14:03.500
plant here.
 

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.331
But if you think about the
Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant

00:14:06.331 --> 00:14:09.496
outside of New York City,
then you need to think about

00:14:09.496 --> 00:14:13.221
the capacity to move tens of
millions of people away from a

00:14:13.221 --> 00:14:17.202
zone that would likely be highly
contaminated in the event of a

00:14:17.202 --> 00:14:20.350
meltdown or an explosion or a
serious fire,

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:25.090
such as existed at Three Mile
Island or at Chernobyl.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:29.178
So the Indian Point facility
prompted Governor Pataki to

00:14:29.178 --> 00:14:33.269
commission a report to evaluate
the evacuation plan,

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:36.726
and criticized the
communication between local

00:14:36.726 --> 00:14:39.187
agencies,
the size of the area that would

00:14:39.187 --> 00:14:42.534
be affected by release,
and the plan's premise is that

00:14:42.534 --> 00:14:45.716
an orderly evacuation,
rather than mass panic,

00:14:45.716 --> 00:14:47.019
would likely ensue.
 

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:50.009
It's kind of interesting,
because if you drive around

00:14:50.009 --> 00:14:53.460
Connecticut within ten miles of
the nuclear power plants,

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.532
occasionally,
you'll see a sign on the side

00:14:56.532 --> 00:14:59.647
of the road,
sometimes very rural roads,

00:14:59.647 --> 00:15:03.831
that notify the public that
this is part of an evacuation

00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:07.120
route in the event of a nuclear
accident.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.716
So that the capacity to move
people away from a contaminated

00:15:11.716 --> 00:15:14.168
zone,
to be able to predict how that

00:15:14.168 --> 00:15:16.669
zone might vary given weather
patterns,

00:15:16.669 --> 00:15:18.408
it really is quite limited.
 

00:15:18.408 --> 00:15:22.923
Also, there was no
consideration of the probability

00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:27.798
or likelihood of a terrorist
attack at these plants.

00:15:27.798 --> 00:15:31.676
And this raised the possibility
that there ought to be aerial

00:15:31.676 --> 00:15:34.099
surveillance,
that there ought to be planes

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.590
that are flying nearby these
nuclear power plants,

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:41.889
as there was shortly after the
9/11 terrorist attack in New

00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:42.529
York.
 

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:46.053
So that the Commission reported
that "Any plant adjacent to

00:15:46.053 --> 00:15:49.410
high population areas should
have different requirements than

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.488
plants otherwise situated
because protective actions are

00:15:52.488 --> 00:15:55.284
more difficult and the
consequences of a failure or

00:15:55.284 --> 00:15:57.019
delay are higher."
 

00:15:57.019 --> 00:15:58.982
And the "planning problems
are more serious because of the

00:15:58.982 --> 00:16:00.250
large population
concentrations."

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.028
So I'm going to jump ahead here.
 

00:16:04.028 --> 00:16:08.221
The core problem associated
with waste is radioactive

00:16:08.221 --> 00:16:09.190
half-life.
 

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.960
And the key concern is over
plutonium.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.236
And there are 270 tons of
separated plutonium from

00:16:18.236 --> 00:16:23.649
reprocessing of fuel rods around
the world that now are sitting

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:26.269
at sites and being stored.
 

00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:29.320
And it has a half-life of
roughly 24,000 years.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.856
So when engineers and safety
experts were thinking about the

00:16:33.856 --> 00:16:39.072
problem posed by Yucca Mountain,
this is the mountain in Nevada

00:16:39.072 --> 00:16:44.120
where the storage facility has
been partially constructed,

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.110
using about nine billion
dollars of taxpayers' money.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:53.005
So that the problem really here
was how do you ensure the

00:16:53.005 --> 00:16:58.340
integrity of a storage facility
for nearly a million years?

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:03.340
And they chose this site
because of its remoteness.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.598
Poor Nevada.
 

00:17:04.598 --> 00:17:07.912
Remember, Nevada was also the
site of the Atmospheric Weapons

00:17:07.912 --> 00:17:10.560
Testing Facility,
the largest and most often used

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.390
in the U.S.
 

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:17.234
And they designed a machine
that would bore into the rock

00:17:17.234 --> 00:17:23.914
and create a tunnel within which
either canisters would be stored

00:17:23.914 --> 00:17:27.635
as dry fuel,
or they could be stored in

00:17:27.635 --> 00:17:28.160
water.
 

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.644
So the fuel is highly
radioactive, and it's cooled in

00:17:31.644 --> 00:17:34.259
pools of water or in these dry
casks.

00:17:34.259 --> 00:17:37.930
And it's currently stored at
sixty-six sites in the U.S.

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.568
This is what one of the storage
facilities might look like.

00:17:41.568 --> 00:17:45.426
And that honeycombed set of
boxes that you can barely see in

00:17:45.426 --> 00:17:49.219
the bottom of the pool over
here, that's how they store the

00:17:49.219 --> 00:17:51.048
fuel rods, side by side.
 

00:17:51.048 --> 00:17:55.881
By the way, it also creates
radioactive water so that the

00:17:55.881 --> 00:18:00.971
amount of liquid waste that is
contaminated is far larger in

00:18:00.971 --> 00:18:06.406
volume than the amount of waste
that is either low level or high

00:18:06.406 --> 00:18:07.960
level waste.
 

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.805
So it was also curious that if
you're projecting out a risk

00:18:11.805 --> 00:18:15.518
management strategy over tens of
thousands or hundreds of

00:18:15.518 --> 00:18:18.818
thousands of years,
you know what happens if

00:18:18.818 --> 00:18:23.305
something occurs and society no
longer speaks a language that is

00:18:23.305 --> 00:18:24.730
understood today?
 

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:28.278
What if some massive accident
occurred,

00:18:28.278 --> 00:18:33.210
nuclear war or whatever it is,
that leads whatever society

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:38.140
exists that stumbles across this
plant to recognize it?

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.750
Kind of interesting.
 

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.390
In a way, it was a labeling
issue.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:45.637
How do you communicate risk,
not using language,

00:18:45.637 --> 00:18:48.170
but using symbols instead?
 

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.460
So the Department of Energy
commissioned anthropologists to

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.900
think about different forms of
symbolism.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.685
And they went back and looked
at what symbols would best

00:18:58.685 --> 00:19:03.819
convey the idea that there was
something extremely dangerous

00:19:03.819 --> 00:19:06.170
nearby or to stay away.
 

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:12.710
And the symbolism that is
chosen is not represented here.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.047
But the nuclear symbols that
you see in the upper right hand

00:19:16.047 --> 00:19:19.271
side of this slide are those
that are commonly used by the

00:19:19.271 --> 00:19:20.460
nuclear industry.
 

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:26.190
But you can imagine if you did
not know the culture today,

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:30.288
if you'd never seen any symbol
on the side of a truck,

00:19:30.288 --> 00:19:32.292
for example,
sometimes trucks have some of

00:19:32.292 --> 00:19:35.420
these symbols that you wouldn't
have any idea what this meant.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.154
The symbols on the lower right
are symbols that are commonly

00:19:40.154 --> 00:19:44.568
applied for industrial and
worker safety situations,

00:19:44.568 --> 00:19:50.170
whereas the symbol on the left
is several hundred years old.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.509
So that I mentioned a lawsuit.
 

00:19:54.509 --> 00:19:57.589
This most recent lawsuit this
year, this spring,

00:19:57.589 --> 00:19:59.358
by Washington State v.
 

00:19:59.358 --> 00:20:03.058
The Department of Energy,
was designed to encourage the

00:20:03.058 --> 00:20:06.567
federal government to keep the
Yucca Mountain Repository

00:20:06.567 --> 00:20:07.269
viable.
 

00:20:07.269 --> 00:20:09.752
"The Attorney General
McKenna made the right decision

00:20:09.752 --> 00:20:12.193
to file his lawsuit today to
stop the Administration from

00:20:12.193 --> 00:20:13.848
closing down Yucca
Mountain."

00:20:13.848 --> 00:20:19.794
Now, another problem with
nuclear power is the potential

00:20:19.794 --> 00:20:24.009
for proliferation of nuclear
weapons.

00:20:24.009 --> 00:20:28.726
So one might think that we need
to think about an international

00:20:28.726 --> 00:20:32.910
strategy to control the
distribution of nuclear fuel.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:39.673
So processed nuclear fuel could
be further enriched to form a

00:20:39.673 --> 00:20:45.308
weapon grade that could produce
nuclear weapons.

00:20:45.308 --> 00:20:49.857
So the International Atomic
Energy Agency and several other

00:20:49.857 --> 00:20:54.013
private organizations banded
together to encourage the

00:20:54.013 --> 00:20:58.953
creation of a nuclear fuel bank
so that the G8 has been proposed

00:20:58.953 --> 00:21:02.796
to constitute this bank and be
responsible for the

00:21:02.796 --> 00:21:07.423
dissemination of nuclear fuel
and then for its recovery once

00:21:07.423 --> 00:21:09.068
it's spent.
 

00:21:09.068 --> 00:21:14.011
In this way,
they would have a collaborative

00:21:14.011 --> 00:21:18.150
attempt to try to manage the
fuel.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:23.207
Thinking also about the MIT
faculty's conclusions regarding

00:21:23.207 --> 00:21:26.218
safety,
they ended their report saying

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:29.140
that parallel with improved
operations,

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.532
the safety record of the
nuclear industry has really been

00:21:32.532 --> 00:21:35.200
quite remarkable in the last
twenty years.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.285
And it plays-- the
"nuclear power industry

00:21:38.285 --> 00:21:41.773
displays by far the highest
capacity factor among all

00:21:41.773 --> 00:21:45.538
generation technologies,
providing now about twenty

00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:46.940
percent of the U.S.
 

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.288
electrical supply."
 

00:21:48.288 --> 00:21:54.858
So that the belief is that most
reactors,

00:21:54.858 --> 00:21:57.108
particularly the latest
generation reactors,

00:21:57.108 --> 00:21:59.588
have the capacity to operate
safely,

00:21:59.588 --> 00:22:04.354
but that the probability of
bringing them online in a way

00:22:04.354 --> 00:22:09.202
that would make a significant
difference in the world with

00:22:09.202 --> 00:22:14.136
respect to effects of energy
consumption and climate change

00:22:14.136 --> 00:22:16.690
is really quite limited.
 

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.230
So that with respect to the
enrichment problem,

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.348
for example,
uranium, when it's mined,

00:22:23.348 --> 00:22:28.318
is approximately point seven
percent uranium-235,

00:22:28.318 --> 00:22:32.428
but it needs to have that
increased to four to five

00:22:32.428 --> 00:22:37.112
percent in order for it to be
useable as fuel in a nuclear

00:22:37.112 --> 00:22:41.276
power plant,
compared to twenty percent that

00:22:41.276 --> 00:22:44.308
it has to be for nuclear
devices.

00:22:44.308 --> 00:22:50.010
The Three Mile Island example
in 1979 created quite a bit of

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:55.548
alarm in the United States,
and it was also a time when a

00:22:55.548 --> 00:23:00.192
movie came out called The
China Syndrome that

00:23:00.192 --> 00:23:05.199
dramatized the effects of a
nuclear accident in an urban

00:23:05.199 --> 00:23:06.108
area.
 

00:23:06.108 --> 00:23:09.978
And the nuclear facility at
Three Mile Island experienced

00:23:09.978 --> 00:23:12.880
what was about a sixty percent
meltdown.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:18.287
And like most major accidents,
whether or not it's the space

00:23:18.287 --> 00:23:23.420
shuttle that blew up or the
Bhopal incident in India,

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.818
where it's estimated that more
than 100,000 people were killed

00:23:27.818 --> 00:23:31.700
in a chemical plant explosion,
or in Chernobyl,

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:36.950
many people think about the
problem being assigned to and

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:41.684
caused by technical failure,
technology failure,

00:23:41.684 --> 00:23:43.328
hardware failure.
 

00:23:43.328 --> 00:23:46.083
When in fact,
it's almost always human

00:23:46.083 --> 00:23:50.400
failure, human failure to
monitor equipment effectively.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.190
And that was certainly the case
at Three Mile Island,

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:58.362
when workers mistook the need
to open a valve to allow cooling

00:23:58.362 --> 00:24:03.960
water to go in and cool down the
fuel rods that were heating up.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.808
So in Bhopal,
it was a problem of gauges.

00:24:06.808 --> 00:24:09.848
With the space shuttle blowing
up,

00:24:09.848 --> 00:24:12.788
it was a problem of
misrecognizing the heat shield

00:24:12.788 --> 00:24:16.105
tiles that had fallen off,
and that were highly

00:24:16.105 --> 00:24:17.920
temperature sensitive.
 

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:22.823
So that the shuttle took off
during temperature conditions

00:24:22.823 --> 00:24:26.348
that some recognized made it
dangerous.

00:24:26.348 --> 00:24:32.313
So the case history that is
most important I think for us to

00:24:32.313 --> 00:24:35.433
think about,
which caused the greatest

00:24:35.433 --> 00:24:39.157
amount of environmental damage
in history with respect to a

00:24:39.157 --> 00:24:43.460
nuclear power plant occurred at
the Chernobyl plant in Pripyat,

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:51.190
then within the Soviet Union.
 

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:55.270
And this occurred in April of
1986 and occurred during a

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:59.352
yearly maintenance operation,
where they were pursuing a

00:24:59.352 --> 00:25:01.430
gradual power reduction.
 

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:07.068
And they basically lost control
of their maintenance efforts.

00:25:07.068 --> 00:25:10.450
And the control rods were
removed too quickly,

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:15.700
and then the power shot back
down too low,

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:21.828
and the water in the plant was
turned in an improper direction.

00:25:21.828 --> 00:25:25.190
The workers were confused about
what to do.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.294
The power surged 1,500 times
its safe level within five

00:25:29.294 --> 00:25:32.740
seconds,
and a steel shield on the roof

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.308
of the building was blown into
the sky,

00:25:36.308 --> 00:25:40.633
and the entire facility caught
fire for a period of several

00:25:40.633 --> 00:25:41.230
weeks.
 

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.539
So four days later,
after the Soviet Union has

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:47.986
maintained their silence,
the government announced,

00:25:47.986 --> 00:25:51.259
"An accident has occurred
at the Chernobyl Atomic Power

00:25:51.259 --> 00:25:51.868
Station.
 

00:25:51.868 --> 00:25:54.019
One of the nuclear reactors has
been damaged.

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:56.827
Measures are being taken to
eliminate the consequence of the

00:25:56.827 --> 00:25:58.462
accident,
aid is being given to the

00:25:58.462 --> 00:26:00.336
victims, and a government
commission has been

00:26:00.336 --> 00:26:01.230
established."
 

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:05.704
So anyone who knows anything
about industrial accidents or

00:26:05.704 --> 00:26:09.944
nuclear power plants would
recognize that being able to

00:26:09.944 --> 00:26:13.713
warn the public immediately
after an accident was

00:26:13.713 --> 00:26:16.068
exceptionally important.
 

00:26:16.068 --> 00:26:21.897
The only nuclear event that
this could be compared to was

00:26:21.897 --> 00:26:25.876
one at Windscale,
now known as Sellafield,

00:26:25.876 --> 00:26:29.038
in the northern part of Great
Britain,

00:26:29.038 --> 00:26:32.790
where in 1956,
there was a fire in the plant

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:37.852
and a significant amount of
radiation was released into the

00:26:37.852 --> 00:26:38.548
air.
 

00:26:38.548 --> 00:26:41.982
And the workers of the plant
went out and commandeered the

00:26:41.982 --> 00:26:45.416
tractors and cars of farmers
that lived in the surrounding

00:26:45.416 --> 00:26:45.960
area.
 

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.696
And the farmers were standing
in the field watching these

00:26:49.696 --> 00:26:53.634
workers basically drive away in
a caravan as quickly as they

00:26:53.634 --> 00:26:57.038
could so that they could reduce
their exposure.

00:26:57.038 --> 00:27:02.124
Again, no government warning,
no attempts to evacuate the

00:27:02.124 --> 00:27:02.759
area.
 

00:27:02.759 --> 00:27:07.282
So that the failure to take
action soon after an accident

00:27:07.282 --> 00:27:11.724
like this results in the
population being exposed at the

00:27:11.724 --> 00:27:13.259
highest levels.
 

00:27:13.259 --> 00:27:16.893
So the Soviets then disclosed
"a certain leak of

00:27:16.893 --> 00:27:20.665
radioactive substances,"
and then finally told the

00:27:20.665 --> 00:27:23.880
public that 200 people were
hospitalized,

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.630
but that the water and the air
in Kiev were safe.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.750
They were reassuring the public
in fact,

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.816
at the same time that their air
force was seeding the clouds in

00:27:32.816 --> 00:27:36.535
the area,
trying to induce rain so that

00:27:36.535 --> 00:27:43.107
it could wash the radiation from
the sky before it reached the

00:27:43.107 --> 00:27:49.250
Russian state and also to
protect the reservoir that is to

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:51.730
the north of Kiev.
 

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:55.345
So finally, President Gorbachev
in '86 came on the news one

00:27:55.345 --> 00:27:57.588
evening and said,
"Good evening,

00:27:57.588 --> 00:27:58.400
comrades.
 

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.358
All of you know that there's
been an incredible misfortune.

00:28:00.358 --> 00:28:04.200
The accident at the Chernobyl
plant has painfully affected the

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.788
Soviet people and shocked the
international community,

00:28:07.788 --> 00:28:10.361
and for the first time,
we confront the real force of

00:28:10.361 --> 00:28:12.240
nuclear energy out of
control."

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.747
There are a variety of
different stories and lessons

00:28:16.747 --> 00:28:21.785
here, but perhaps the one that
is most sad is the way that

00:28:21.785 --> 00:28:24.259
workers were mistreated.
 

00:28:24.259 --> 00:28:28.385
The effects of being exposed to
radiation in the absence of

00:28:28.385 --> 00:28:32.298
protective gear was very well
known to the Atomic Energy

00:28:32.298 --> 00:28:36.355
Commission and to the Soviet
scientific experts from their

00:28:36.355 --> 00:28:39.130
experiences with nuclear
weapons.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:44.490
But other than potassium iodide
pills and the normal kind of a

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:49.150
suit that a fireman might wear
as protective gear,

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:53.241
they were left helpless,
even though they were told to

00:28:53.241 --> 00:28:57.334
go in and try to put out the
flames of the burning and

00:28:57.334 --> 00:28:59.108
charring fuel rods.
 

00:28:59.108 --> 00:29:03.773
So also, the Soviets and others
misunderstood the pattern of

00:29:03.773 --> 00:29:07.727
distribution of the
radionuclides once they reached

00:29:07.727 --> 00:29:09.230
the atmosphere.
 

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:13.491
So here you see April 26,
the white that you see in the

00:29:13.491 --> 00:29:17.280
right hand side of the upper
left air photo here,

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.068
is demonstrating the direction
of the plume.

00:29:21.068 --> 00:29:24.741
By April 28,
the plume had reached up over

00:29:24.741 --> 00:29:27.430
Norway, Sweden,
and Finland.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:30.575
By April 30,
you can tell that the plume was

00:29:30.575 --> 00:29:35.108
being dispersed and being blown
back around northern Europe.

00:29:35.108 --> 00:29:37.976
And eventually,
by May 6, it had scattered

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:42.030
itself pretty much all over
Europe, with a patchy kind of a

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.288
concentration.
 

00:29:43.288 --> 00:29:46.926
And you remember the surprise
on the part of the Atomic Energy

00:29:46.926 --> 00:29:49.730
Commission to the patchiness of
the fallout,

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:54.117
finding high levels of
strontium-90 in New York and

00:29:54.117 --> 00:29:58.769
Connecticut when the cloud
intercepted a rainstorm.

00:29:58.769 --> 00:30:03.136
And this affected a fallout
pattern that was really quite

00:30:03.136 --> 00:30:05.788
similarly non-uniform in Europe.
 

00:30:05.788 --> 00:30:09.626
And it took roughly about ten
days for this plume to make its

00:30:09.626 --> 00:30:11.930
way all the way around the
world,

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:15.540
moving across China and then
the Pacific Ocean to reach the

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.455
United States,
when it became detectable in

00:30:18.455 --> 00:30:22.101
the milk supplies in states such
as Utah and Arizona and

00:30:22.101 --> 00:30:23.028
California.
 

00:30:23.028 --> 00:30:26.755
So that the sensors that
existed at that point in time

00:30:26.755 --> 00:30:30.761
were picking up contaminants
eventually distributed around

00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:34.910
the United States and eventually
the rest of the world.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:40.560
So as you look at this map,
you see a radiation deposition

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:45.318
gradient from lightest color to
darkest color.

00:30:45.318 --> 00:30:49.307
And what's so striking about it
is that you see the patchiness

00:30:49.307 --> 00:30:52.074
demonstrated here,
where you have a significant

00:30:52.074 --> 00:30:55.343
deposition in Austria,
a significant deposition in

00:30:55.343 --> 00:30:58.798
Finland and up in both Norway
and in Sweden.

00:30:58.798 --> 00:31:03.001
And the distance,
by the way, is probably about

00:31:03.001 --> 00:31:06.564
600 to 700 miles,
maybe about 800 miles,

00:31:06.564 --> 00:31:10.308
from Chernobyl up to Northern
Europe.

00:31:10.308 --> 00:31:15.465
So one thing that this did was
it created complete chaos in

00:31:15.465 --> 00:31:17.598
European food markets.
 

00:31:17.598 --> 00:31:21.424
So if it reached the ground,
it was getting into the food

00:31:21.424 --> 00:31:22.038
supply.
 

00:31:22.038 --> 00:31:25.502
Well, they realized that the
different nations all had

00:31:25.502 --> 00:31:27.528
separate radiation standards.
 

00:31:27.528 --> 00:31:32.500
So that they did not have a
uniform regulatory system to

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:37.742
protect against one nation
selling one commodity that had a

00:31:37.742 --> 00:31:43.076
radiation level that might not
be accepted by another nation

00:31:43.076 --> 00:31:46.150
that had a tougher standard.
 

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:50.913
Also, the detection process,
you can imagine that the

00:31:50.913 --> 00:31:55.951
government was slow to go out
and try to figure out this

00:31:55.951 --> 00:31:58.700
patchiness with precision.
 

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.563
And that had tremendous
implications for the period of

00:32:01.563 --> 00:32:03.130
exposure by the population.
 

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:07.766
So here's a good example of the
distributional pattern as it was

00:32:07.766 --> 00:32:12.328
being recognized by the Soviet
Union back in the late 1980s.

00:32:12.328 --> 00:32:15.118
And as they tested more,
they found more.

00:32:15.118 --> 00:32:19.339
So that this map was constantly
changing in response to more

00:32:19.339 --> 00:32:20.700
rigorous testing.
 

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.262
So that the different zones
that you see here are designated

00:32:25.262 --> 00:32:29.152
as confiscated areas,
permanent control areas,

00:32:29.152 --> 00:32:32.450
period control areas,
and unregulated areas.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:36.048
So that the darkest red are the
confiscated areas.

00:32:36.048 --> 00:32:39.080
So that lands,
agricultural lands,

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.113
urban lands,
homes, residential communities,

00:32:43.113 --> 00:32:46.637
commercial areas,
were literally confiscated so

00:32:46.637 --> 00:32:50.501
that hundreds of thousands of
people were moved off of their

00:32:50.501 --> 00:32:54.604
land because the soils,
the plants, as well as the

00:32:54.604 --> 00:32:57.595
building materials,
and even the vehicles,

00:32:57.595 --> 00:32:58.548
were contaminated.
 

00:32:58.548 --> 00:33:02.352
Hundreds of thousands of
vehicles turned into hazardous

00:33:02.352 --> 00:33:05.170
waste, almost within a matter of
days.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:08.519
So what to do with this area?
 

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:11.201
What do you do with people that
you're going to pull out of

00:33:11.201 --> 00:33:11.848
their homes?
 

00:33:11.848 --> 00:33:13.720
Well, they had to build new
communities.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.872
And in some instances,
they even built new communities

00:33:15.872 --> 00:33:18.186
in areas that were contaminated
because they hadn't tested

00:33:18.186 --> 00:33:19.038
carefully enough.
 

00:33:19.038 --> 00:33:21.561
Kind of interesting,
because it should ring bells

00:33:21.561 --> 00:33:24.400
with you with respect to the
Bikini Island history,

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.707
where the Bikinians were
allowed to move back into an

00:33:27.707 --> 00:33:31.204
area that the government
supplied funds for constructing

00:33:31.204 --> 00:33:33.221
new homes,
and then they went in and

00:33:33.221 --> 00:33:35.940
tested that more carefully and
found that they had to move out.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.507
So that the tension here is
that the government will want to

00:33:39.507 --> 00:33:43.577
limit its own liability,
its own costs for evacuating or

00:33:43.577 --> 00:33:46.329
for dealing with hazardous
waste,

00:33:46.329 --> 00:33:48.858
or for rebuilding a community.
 

00:33:48.858 --> 00:33:54.503
So it has very little incentive
to disclose with precision the

00:33:54.503 --> 00:33:57.650
intensity of the concentrations.
 

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:01.669
So in this case,
the precision grew in response

00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:06.387
to international pressure
because they were finding the

00:34:06.387 --> 00:34:11.456
patchy highly contaminated areas
in many different European

00:34:11.456 --> 00:34:13.030
communities.
 

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:16.195
And those different countries
wanted to have international

00:34:16.195 --> 00:34:19.251
authority to take the Soviet
Union to court so that they

00:34:19.251 --> 00:34:22.030
could be compensated for their
losses as well.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:27.222
The construction workers that
were trying to put out the fire

00:34:27.222 --> 00:34:31.722
and then deal with the
contaminated areas would drive

00:34:31.722 --> 00:34:35.530
vehicles in whether they were
aircraft,

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:39.110
whether or not they were cars
or trucks such as this.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.889
The workers eventually were
suited up in protective gear,

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:46.543
and they had to wash down the
vehicles as they left the site

00:34:46.543 --> 00:34:49.889
to keep the vehicles from
tracking the radionuclides to

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.429
different parts of the affected
area.

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:56.509
I mentioned that agricultural
lands were obviously affected,

00:34:56.509 --> 00:35:00.726
especially those within the red
zones on the map that you just

00:35:00.726 --> 00:35:01.280
saw.
 

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.110
What do you do with
contaminated lands like this?

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.298
Well, you basically have to
scrape the surface off of it and

00:35:07.298 --> 00:35:10.760
figure out how you're going to
bury the contaminated material.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.679
So that think about this,
76,000 thousand square

00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:19.239
kilometers of contaminated land.
 

00:35:19.239 --> 00:35:21.760
And what about the forest lands?
 

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:26.250
What would happen to the timber
that were growing in the area?

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.789
Well, they also absorb the
radionuclides.

00:35:28.789 --> 00:35:31.059
And many of those trees were
still standing.

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:34.340
And many people would cut down
the contaminated trees,

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.436
cut the timber,
saw it up, turn it into

00:35:37.436 --> 00:35:40.362
building material,
and people would build their

00:35:40.362 --> 00:35:40.969
houses of it.
 

00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:47.947
There's a similar analogy to
the way that the uranium mines

00:35:47.947 --> 00:35:52.880
created the fuel for the power
plants,

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.809
the way that those mines left
waste of uranium mine tailings.

00:35:58.809 --> 00:36:00.469
So what did they do with that?
 

00:36:00.469 --> 00:36:04.010
Well in some instances,
they used the mine tailings as

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:07.751
a construction material for
homes, particularly on Native

00:36:07.751 --> 00:36:09.489
American reservations.
 

00:36:09.489 --> 00:36:15.380
So there's a very unhappy and
costly history of how Navajos

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:21.574
were living in homes that were
built from cement products that

00:36:21.574 --> 00:36:23.809
contained uranium.
 

00:36:23.809 --> 00:36:29.184
So that the enormity of the
effect of the contamination was

00:36:29.184 --> 00:36:32.518
just beyond anybody's
expectation.

00:36:32.518 --> 00:36:37.050
Cars, trucks,
tanks had to be buried.

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:40.358
And there are many stories
about how cars would be buried

00:36:40.358 --> 00:36:41.010
at night.
 

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:45.842
They'd be dug up before dawn,
and parts from those cars would

00:36:45.842 --> 00:36:49.630
then be removed and sold on the
black market.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:54.829
So you all know that there's a
very robust used car part market

00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:57.849
virtually everywhere in the
world.

00:36:57.849 --> 00:37:02.219
So that these radioactive used
parts were brought back,

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:04.889
recycled back into circulation.
 

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:07.880
In Sweden it's interesting.
 

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.719
Because the Swedes found out
about this,

00:37:09.719 --> 00:37:12.960
not because they were notified
by the Soviets or any other

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.998
nation,
but because their workers

00:37:14.998 --> 00:37:18.697
showed up at their nuclear power
plants and they started setting

00:37:18.697 --> 00:37:19.518
off alarms.
 

00:37:19.518 --> 00:37:22.335
So that power plants in Sweden
were shut down one after

00:37:22.335 --> 00:37:24.378
another,
but not because there was a

00:37:24.378 --> 00:37:27.847
problem at their plant,
but because their workers were

00:37:27.847 --> 00:37:31.992
walking in the door to the plant
in the morning and they had

00:37:31.992 --> 00:37:35.998
picked up the radionuclides that
had been deposited on the

00:37:35.998 --> 00:37:38.880
streets or the sidewalks in
Sweden,

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.429
and that contamination had set
off the alarms.

00:37:42.429 --> 00:37:44.512
That's when they started
looking at weather patterns and

00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:46.329
trying to figure out what the
source might be.

00:37:46.329 --> 00:37:48.983
There was no evidence that a
nuclear weapon had been

00:37:48.983 --> 00:37:51.610
detonated,
so they started at the location

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:55.260
of nuclear power plants and were
able to piece together the

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.847
weather pattern over the past
several days to pinpoint the

00:37:58.847 --> 00:38:00.170
Chernobyl plant.
 

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:04.358
So that within several days,
the radiation in Sweden was

00:38:04.358 --> 00:38:08.090
1,000 times higher than it
previously had been.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:13.945
So I'm going to jump ahead here
to a discussion about

00:38:13.945 --> 00:38:15.409
evacuation.
 

00:38:15.409 --> 00:38:18.929
Civil defense officials were
finally able to convince the

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:22.639
government and plant officials
of the need to evacuate areas

00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:24.840
that were closest to the plant.
 

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.550
But thirty-six hours had passed.
 

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:30.806
And these are,
if you look at the current

00:38:30.806 --> 00:38:36.018
charts about the periodicity of
the release of the radiation,

00:38:36.018 --> 00:38:38.710
you find that this first
thirty-six hours was a crucial

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.273
period,
when that population should not

00:38:41.273 --> 00:38:43.869
have been allowed to stay in the
area.

00:38:43.869 --> 00:38:46.630
So that they really had no plan.
 

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:50.456
The government eventually was
able to put together 1,000 buses

00:38:50.456 --> 00:38:54.407
and picked up first the children
and then moved them hundreds of

00:38:54.407 --> 00:38:56.539
miles away to different camps.
 

00:38:56.539 --> 00:39:00.083
So as they studied the pattern
of deposition,

00:39:00.083 --> 00:39:04.351
they found that their
evacuation zone had been defined

00:39:04.351 --> 00:39:05.719
too narrowly.
 

00:39:05.719 --> 00:39:10.539
So the evacuation zone had to
be continually expanded.

00:39:10.539 --> 00:39:14.300
So that by May 3,
this was only about six or

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.974
seven days later,
45,000 residents had been

00:39:17.974 --> 00:39:21.650
evacuated from a ten-kilometer
radius.

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:27.780
Eventually, 210,000 people were
resettled into less contaminated

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:28.559
areas.
 

00:39:28.559 --> 00:39:32.293
By the way, if you take the
United States' requirement that

00:39:32.293 --> 00:39:36.286
every nuclear power plant in our
nation have an evacuation plan

00:39:36.286 --> 00:39:40.407
that would cover an area that is
defined by a ten-mile radius and

00:39:40.407 --> 00:39:44.014
you compare it to the movement
of contamination from this

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:47.463
plant,
you can see the ten-mile radius

00:39:47.463 --> 00:39:52.110
in green here compared to the
eventual location of the deep

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:57.320
red colored confiscation zones
more than a hundred miles away.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.713
So I'm going to jump ahead here
because I'm going to run out of

00:40:01.713 --> 00:40:02.210
time.
 

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:07.844
The safety regulations varied
quite highly among the different

00:40:07.844 --> 00:40:11.909
nations, leading to a chaotic
set of bans.

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:14.862
So that finally,
the Europeans decided to ban

00:40:14.862 --> 00:40:17.884
meat, live animals,
and produce from all areas

00:40:17.884 --> 00:40:20.570
within 1,000 kilometers of the
site.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.679
The economic consequences were
enormous.

00:40:23.679 --> 00:40:27.726
So that the Austrian government
banned the import of East Block

00:40:27.726 --> 00:40:29.215
milk,
fruit and vegetables,

00:40:29.215 --> 00:40:31.929
the Dutch Agricultural Ministry
prohibited cattle grazing.

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:34.905
The Swiss were warned against
providing fresh milk to young

00:40:34.905 --> 00:40:35.469
children.
 

00:40:35.469 --> 00:40:38.090
Italy banned the sale of its
own leafy vegetables.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:39.889
And even the U.S.
 

00:40:39.889 --> 00:40:44.217
was warning people not to go to
several European nations because

00:40:44.217 --> 00:40:46.760
of the extent of the
contamination.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:50.279
So the economic consequences
just associated with the food

00:40:50.279 --> 00:40:53.737
supply and its contamination
were far higher than anybody

00:40:53.737 --> 00:40:54.539
imagined.
 

00:40:54.539 --> 00:41:01.315
There's also a sad story about
the Sami indigenous group in

00:41:01.315 --> 00:41:08.090
northern Sweden that have long
relied upon the livestock of

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.610
reindeer.
 

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.130
And reindeer feed on moss and
lichen,

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:15.931
and the radionuclides built up
heavily in the moss and lichen

00:41:15.931 --> 00:41:19.670
and were detectable in their
meat within a matter of several

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.699
days following the accident.
 

00:41:21.699 --> 00:41:26.469
So that the Swedish government
decided that it was going to ban

00:41:26.469 --> 00:41:31.083
the sale of all future products
from these animals except for

00:41:31.083 --> 00:41:32.699
the sale of furs.
 

00:41:32.699 --> 00:41:38.076
So to come to a conclusion
here, you'll be able to study

00:41:38.076 --> 00:41:43.353
this slide not from this
lecture, but up on the Classes

00:41:43.353 --> 00:41:44.429
server.
 

00:41:44.429 --> 00:41:49.300
So that if you think about the
relative amount of radioactivity

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:53.780
that was released by the first
atomic bombs in curies,

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:59.311
you see the first atomic bombs
up here on the top at Nagasaki

00:41:59.311 --> 00:42:04.936
and Hiroshima having released
about 250,000 curies from atomic

00:42:04.936 --> 00:42:07.518
weapons testing totally.
 

00:42:07.518 --> 00:42:10.844
During that period,
the atmospheric weapons

00:42:10.844 --> 00:42:14.010
testing, those figures are given
here.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:17.182
But then if you look down here
at Chernobyl,

00:42:17.182 --> 00:42:21.536
you find that the estimates of
exposure and the estimates of

00:42:21.536 --> 00:42:24.710
those exposed are really quite
amazing.

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:30.070
Seventeen thousand and four
hundred fatal cancers were

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:34.518
expected among 2.9 billion
people exposed.

00:42:34.518 --> 00:42:37.005
So more than half of the
world's population was exposed

00:42:37.005 --> 00:42:39.489
to fallout from this nuclear
power plant explosion,

00:42:39.489 --> 00:42:45.010
with a very serious estimate of
fatal cancer outcomes.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:48.268
Compared to the Atomic Weapons
Testing Program,

00:42:48.268 --> 00:42:51.760
where among everybody at the
time--this report was done back

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.659
in the 1990s by the National
Cancer Institute--

00:42:54.659 --> 00:42:57.414
everybody in the world was
anticipated to have been

00:42:57.414 --> 00:43:00.369
exposed,
but only 12,000 fatal cancers

00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:03.610
were expected from that entire
program.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:07.465
So the magnitude of exposure,
the magnitude of risk,

00:43:07.465 --> 00:43:11.623
is associated with this kind of
a failure, has long been

00:43:11.623 --> 00:43:13.059
underestimated.
 

00:43:13.059 --> 00:43:17.282
Now I'm going to leave you at
this time with one other

00:43:17.282 --> 00:43:20.036
thought,
because I opened the lecture

00:43:20.036 --> 00:43:23.989
saying that we're facing a very
difficult decision on how to

00:43:23.989 --> 00:43:27.740
allocate our resources and
investments in different kinds

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.679
of fuels.
 

00:43:28.679 --> 00:43:31.722
And I want you to think too
about the relative risks

00:43:31.722 --> 00:43:34.230
associated with coal-fired power
plants.

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:37.670
We don't have too much time to
talk about coal.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:43.023
But coal produces not just
sulfur and nitrogen oxides,

00:43:43.023 --> 00:43:45.750
it produces particulates.
 

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.351
And particulates,
particularly in combination--

00:43:48.351 --> 00:43:49.824
particulates,
particularly,

00:43:49.824 --> 00:43:50.389
sorry.
 

00:43:50.389 --> 00:43:55.016
Particulates in combination
with the sulfates pose a very

00:43:55.016 --> 00:43:57.000
serious health threat.
 

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.536
And many people don't realize
that between 20,000 and 60,000

00:44:00.536 --> 00:44:04.192
premature deaths in the United
States alone every year are now

00:44:04.192 --> 00:44:06.829
attributable to coal-fired power
plants.

00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:10.266
On a world scale,
the number is far more

00:44:10.266 --> 00:44:11.500
significant.
 

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:15.219
So these are deaths that are
premature deaths,

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:20.251
particularly among those that
have background conditions of

00:44:20.251 --> 00:44:25.889
cardiovascular illness or other
kinds of respiratory illnesses.

00:44:25.889 --> 00:44:30.735
So that premature deaths from
this form of energy are far

00:44:30.735 --> 00:44:35.496
higher than have ever been
accounted for with respect to

00:44:35.496 --> 00:44:37.659
the nuclear industry.
 

00:44:37.659 --> 00:44:44.309
So that coal has this image of
being a relatively safe fuel

00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:47.518
compared to nuclear power.
 

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:50.300
But I'm hoping to get you to
rethink that.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:55.085
The nuclear waste issue I think
is overwhelmingly persuasive to

00:44:55.085 --> 00:44:59.021
me that the nuclear industry
should not be seriously

00:44:59.021 --> 00:45:00.179
encouraged.
 

00:45:00.179 --> 00:45:04.434
And I am disappointed and
surprised by the Obama

00:45:04.434 --> 00:45:09.684
Administration's support that
came out just a few weeks ago

00:45:09.684 --> 00:45:10.679
for it.
 

00:45:10.679 --> 00:45:13.016
And next Tuesday,
we'll be talking about the

00:45:13.016 --> 00:45:15.197
future of renewables,
and particularly,

00:45:15.197 --> 00:45:17.938
the different kinds of legal
strategies that have been

00:45:17.938 --> 00:45:20.413
employed,
including tax strategies,

00:45:20.413 --> 00:45:24.347
different subsidies,
different kind of credit

00:45:24.347 --> 00:45:29.726
systems, in order to try to
increase human investment in

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:31.780
renewable sources.
 

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:35.150
So have a great weekend and
enjoy the weather.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:41.000

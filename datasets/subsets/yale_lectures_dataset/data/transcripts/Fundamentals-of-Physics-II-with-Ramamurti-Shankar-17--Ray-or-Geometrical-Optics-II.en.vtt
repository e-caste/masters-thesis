00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.187
Prof: All right,
I'm hoping that this interlude

00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:12.594
into optics will give you a
chance to catch up and be on top

00:00:12.594 --> 00:00:16.030
of the class,
okay?

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.340
I take that to be a yes.
 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.080
So if you have to give an
elevator presentation of

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.972
geometrical optics,
you're riding in the elevator

00:00:25.972 --> 00:00:27.730
with some big shot,
you get what,

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.590
60 seconds and you have to tell
that person everything,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.860
what would you say?
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.950
Any guess?
 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.810
Student: 
&gt;

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.106
Prof: Right,
Principle of Least Time covers

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:43.375
everything,
and I thought I would do that,

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.089
because I'm sure you guys,
most of you,

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:46.940
have seen this in one form or
another.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.618
And I had to do something
slightly different,

00:00:49.618 --> 00:00:53.270
and that was to show you that
it all came from Least Time.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.440
Well, I haven't shown the whole
thing yet.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.189
What I did show you is that
angle of incidence = angle of

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:00.060
reflection.
 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.530
That came out.
 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.519
Snell's law, that came out.
 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.680
But I was about to do mirrors
and the case of mirrors,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.860
I said if you want a parallel
set of rays from infinity,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.610
to focus on one point,
then what do you need to do?

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.277
First of all,
focusing itself is a very

00:01:26.277 --> 00:01:27.330
special case.
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.899
Focusing means many light rays
going in different directions

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.300
all end up in the same place.
 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.938
That means they all must
satisfy the Principle of Least

00:01:37.938 --> 00:01:38.410
Time.
 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.330
How can all of them be the
least time?

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.290
Because they all take the same
time.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.274
Therefore there's more than one
way for a light beam to go from

00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:48.730
start to finish and that's when
you get focusing.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.223
This is the first example of
that, and the way it works is,

00:01:52.223 --> 00:01:54.090
you start with this guy here.
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.050
First of all,
the rays are coming from

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.930
infinity.
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.664
If you're going to keep track
of how long that takes,

00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:03.030
you're going to get infinity
for everybody.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.858
Maybe infinity 1 for one and
infinity 2 for another one.

00:02:07.858 --> 00:02:10.681
And we know from the time we
were children that they're all

00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:13.258
the same, so infinity's not a
good reference point.

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:15.352
So you draw the gate here,
a mental gate,

00:02:15.352 --> 00:02:17.341
and you say,
"I'm going to attrack

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:19.120
these guys from this point on.
 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.900
No one's got any head start.
 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.229
Then I want to see how long any
of them takes."

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:27.699
Well, this guy hits that wall,
I mean, this mirror here.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.604
The mirror is locally vertical,
so it will bounce right back,

00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:35.378
and this focal point is where I
want everyone to end up.

00:02:35.378 --> 00:02:40.341
So this ray does that,
loops around and comes back

00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:41.050
here.
 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.830
How much time does it have?
 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.863
Well, it has the time to go
here, plus the time to go an

00:02:47.863 --> 00:02:51.250
equal distance f on the other
side.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.047
That means this light ray which
began here has the same amount

00:02:55.047 --> 00:02:55.669
of time.
 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:00.378
But for this mirror here,
it's got the time to go there.

00:03:00.378 --> 00:03:05.331
But you want it to hit the
mirror and come here in the same

00:03:05.331 --> 00:03:05.930
time.
 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.111
That means it will happen,
only that distance and that

00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:11.770
distance are equal.
 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.158
And this must be true for any
ray parallel to the axis.

00:03:15.158 --> 00:03:19.691
That means your mirror is a
curve with the property that

00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:24.223
points on it have the same
distance from the focal point

00:03:24.223 --> 00:03:26.530
and from this line here.
 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.990
And there's a name for that
curve,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.788
and that is the parabola,
and satisfies the equation,

00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:35.381
y^(2) = 4xf,
where f is the focal

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.280
length.
 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.160
I derived that for you.
 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.287
Then the next question is,
it's not enough to have--then I

00:03:42.287 --> 00:03:46.269
told you that if you want,
you can approximate this by a

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.788
spherical mirror.
 

00:03:47.788 --> 00:03:50.792
You take a sphere or radius
R and you slice a portion

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:51.199
of it.
 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.141
A sphere is not a parabola,
because sphere is going to--put

00:03:55.141 --> 00:03:58.063
a sphere here,
it's going to start deviating

00:03:58.063 --> 00:03:59.560
from the parabola.
 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.055
But you can fool this beam of
light if you don't go too far

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:04.020
from the axis.
 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.610
In that region,
it coincides with the parabola.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.030
And you say, how big a parabola?
 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.282
Well, it looks like a parabola
whose focal length is related to

00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:16.096
the radius of that sphere in
this fashion,

00:04:16.096 --> 00:04:18.360
where f is R/2.
 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.579
That's called a spherical
mirror.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.526
So whenever you do this,
you should be aware of all the

00:04:23.526 --> 00:04:24.290
limitations.
 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.939
A parabolic mirror will focus a
parallel beam of light,

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.180
no matter how wide it is,
measured from the axis,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.339
because I've cooked this up to
work for any height.

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:37.889
If you approximate it with a
spherical mirror,

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.601
then you have to ask yourself,
"How long will this beam

00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:43.040
of light think that the sphere
is a parabola?"

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.178
Well, you can see,
as you start moving off,

00:04:45.178 --> 00:04:47.776
it's going to catch on,
so you cannot go too far off

00:04:47.776 --> 00:04:48.440
the axis.
 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.550
So that's an approximation.
 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.648
And for a spherical mirror,
if you send a parallel beam of

00:04:53.648 --> 00:04:56.475
light, if it's too thick in the
transverse direction,

00:04:56.475 --> 00:04:57.779
it won't focus here.
 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:02.065
It will focus for small
thickness, small deviation from

00:05:02.065 --> 00:05:02.939
the axis.
 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.461
But now our goal in making
mirrors is not only to form the

00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:08.500
image of an object at infinity.
 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.930
We want an object at a finite
distance.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.668
We want object at finite
distance to form an image and

00:05:14.668 --> 00:05:17.209
that's what we were talking
about.

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:20.329
So let's go back to that
problem.

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:23.589
Okay, I'm going to be writing
some equations today,

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.009
and I want to request people in
the last row,

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:31.327
if you cannot read something
you have to tell me if the font

00:05:31.327 --> 00:05:32.319
is small.
 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.745
Guys in the front row,
if you cannot read something

00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:37.269
because handwriting is bad,
you've got to tell me.

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:40.089
People in the last row may not
know why they cannot read it.

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.000
Maybe the handwriting,
maybe the font.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.759
But between the two of you,
you've got to keep me on the

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.470
lookout for that,
okay?

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.050
Because I did realize last
time, I was drawing more and

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.009
more and more lines in the same
figure.

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.389
It was hard to read.
 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.009
All right, so I'm going to
write some equations.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.144
I'm trying to plan my
blackboard strategy here,

00:05:58.144 --> 00:06:00.420
but first I will tell you what
I'm going to do.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.829
I mentioned that to you last
time.

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:06.574
We want to make sure that when
you follow the rules of ray

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:09.269
optics that you learned in high
school.

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:10.819
What do you learn in high
school?

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.189
You say, well,
take any object here.

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.483
You draw a bunch of rays and
you know where they're going to

00:06:17.483 --> 00:06:20.610
intersect because the parallel
ray goes through the focal

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.170
point.
 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.079
That's how it's defined.
 

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:25.040
Here's another ray that's a
little interesting.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.009
Go through the focal point,
you'll come out parallel.

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:30.480
How do I know that?
 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.529
I know that because if I run
this thing backwards,

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:37.079
it's a parallel ray going to
the focal point and ending up

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:37.639
here.
 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.516
If this path was the path of
least time, the reversed one

00:06:40.516 --> 00:06:42.470
should also be a path of least
time.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.230
So these two meet here.
 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.300
So we say that's where the
image is.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.000
But that's not enough.
 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.730
I told you two lines will
always meet.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.146
You've got to draw more lines,
and here is one more that I

00:06:55.146 --> 00:06:55.690
drew.
 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.290
The one that hits the center
here, that's i = r,

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.889
very obvious incidence =
reflection, because the mirror

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.290
is vertical here.
 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.273
I showed you that the third
line demands that

00:07:08.273 --> 00:07:12.889
h_1/u is
h_2/v.

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:15.709
But that's already true from
these two rays.

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:20.012
Remember, the two rays
intersecting here gave the

00:07:20.012 --> 00:07:25.033
condition 1/u 1/v is
1/f and they gave this

00:07:25.033 --> 00:07:26.290
condition.
 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.492
So the third ray which I drew
demands the same thing,

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.189
so it's consistent.
 

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:34.420
But if you really want to nail
this down,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.867
you want to be able to prove
that no matter what height you

00:07:37.867 --> 00:07:40.720
pick for the interception of the
mirror here,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.420
you will take the same time.
 

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.773
Because I've only taken three
special values for the height

00:07:47.773 --> 00:07:48.410
y.
 

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.875
One is y =
h_1,

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:51.829
this beam.
 

00:07:51.829 --> 00:07:54.668
One is y =
h_2,

00:07:54.668 --> 00:07:58.057
or if you like,
-h_2,

00:07:58.057 --> 00:07:59.339
this beam.
 

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:01.144
And y = 0,
the third one,

00:08:01.144 --> 00:08:02.949
and they all happen to agree.
 

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:06.324
I want to take an arbitrary
y and hope that the

00:08:06.324 --> 00:08:08.680
answer will not depend on
y.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.050
The time it takes to travel for
any y should be the same.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.740
And that's where we will find
it is not exactly the same.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.110
Yes?
 

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.019
Student:  What are
u and v?

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:25.797
Prof: u is the
distance of the object measured

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:28.839
from here,
and v is the distance of

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:31.050
the image measured from there.
 

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.058
I don't know what the book
calls them.

00:08:33.058 --> 00:08:34.750
I don't know which book you
guys are using,

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.803
d_i and
d_o and

00:08:36.803 --> 00:08:37.730
i and o.
 

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.720
There's a lot of different
symbols you can use.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.590
So you're free to use any
symbol you want in your problem

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.600
set, as long as you explain to
the TA what you're using.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.764
Unfortunately,
the only thing everyone agrees

00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:53.029
on is that f stands for
focal length.

00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:57.850
That's universal;
these are random.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.090
All right, so do you understand
what I'm going to do?

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.226
Because it's going to take some
time and it's not worth doing it

00:09:04.226 --> 00:09:06.120
unless you know why we are doing
it.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.234
We're trying to verify that the
time it takes to go from here to

00:09:11.234 --> 00:09:16.186
the mirror and over here is the
same for every conceivable ray

00:09:16.186 --> 00:09:18.460
for any height y.
 

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.110
And I'm telling you,
so what would you like to show?

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.669
You would like to show the
following.

00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:28.940
You take this here.
 

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.919
You want to hit that mirror at
some height y,

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:34.558
you make it bigger.
 

00:09:34.558 --> 00:09:36.720
So these are all drawn as very
big,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.250
so that you can follow them,
but the understanding is,

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.075
they are not really that big
compared to the dimensions of

00:09:42.075 --> 00:09:42.720
the mirror.
 

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:49.928
So it goes there and it does
something, and it comes here.

00:09:49.928 --> 00:09:54.509
So this is the point
(x,y) on the parabola

00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:55.940
that it hits.
 

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.139
d_1 is the
distance--

00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.990
I'm going to use Pythagoras'
Theorem to calculate it--

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.432
is that distance,
and d_2 is

00:10:04.432 --> 00:10:06.048
that distance.
 

00:10:06.048 --> 00:10:09.542
So d_1 depends
on y and

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:14.629
d_2 depends on
y and when I add them up,

00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:17.690
that's got to be independent of
y.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.139
That's got to be the same for
all y.

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:25.051
In particular,
it's got to equal the value

00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:29.724
when y = 0,
= d_1(0)

00:10:29.724 --> 00:10:32.240
d_2(0).
 

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.200
That's my reference signal.
 

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:42.154
That's the one that goes here,
hits the center of that and

00:10:42.154 --> 00:10:43.740
comes here.
 

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.928
You guys with me now?
 

00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:48.288
It should be independent of
y, therefore it should be

00:10:48.288 --> 00:10:50.048
equal to the value at any
y I like.

00:10:50.048 --> 00:10:54.870
I'm going to pick the y
= 0 as my reference.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.586
You find the distance
d_1 d_2

00:10:57.586 --> 00:10:59.932
when y is 0,
you move up and down,

00:10:59.932 --> 00:11:02.009
calculate it,
and it shouldn't depend on

00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:02.808
y.
 

00:11:02.808 --> 00:11:07.596
So when I do the calculation,
what do I really hope will

00:11:07.596 --> 00:11:08.379
happen?
 

00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:16.541
If I plot--if I make a plot of
d_1 d_2

00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:25.894
as a function of y,
I'm expecting the answer to be

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:32.009
flat,
independent of y.

00:11:32.009 --> 00:11:35.548
And this is the reference
point, y = 0.

00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:39.408
But when you do the
calculation, first of all,

00:11:39.408 --> 00:11:42.599
if the graph of
d_1 d_2

00:11:42.599 --> 00:11:45.419
looked like this,
that's no good,

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:49.230
because that means if you take
y positive,

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.658
you take a longer time than
y negative.

00:11:52.658 --> 00:11:55.712
Obviously that y and that y are
not paths of least time,

00:11:55.712 --> 00:11:59.100
because one is clearly taking
less time than the other one.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.298
So you don't want anything
growing linearly in y,

00:12:03.298 --> 00:12:06.710
so it's got to be quadratic,
at best.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.883
But then even if it's
quadratic, you go far out,

00:12:09.883 --> 00:12:13.259
you can see that the answer
depends on y.

00:12:13.259 --> 00:12:15.600
So what I will show you is that
the graph,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.658
if you plot it as a function of
y,

00:12:17.658 --> 00:12:21.073
if you plot d_1
d_2 as the

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:24.855
function of y,
it's got some constant,

00:12:24.855 --> 00:12:30.610
which is the time for y
= 0 some coefficient Ay

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.158
some By^(2) 
Cy^(3).

00:12:34.158 --> 00:12:36.928
These are all possible things
that can happen.

00:12:36.928 --> 00:12:41.206
If you want perfect focusing
for any value of y,

00:12:41.206 --> 00:12:45.721
all of these guys have to
vanish, because it cannot depend

00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:46.990
on y.
 

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:53.231
But we will find out it's the
first two guys that vanish and

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:57.570
there is no guarantee about the
others.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.230
But of course,
from dimension analysis,

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.690
when you have a y and a
y^(2) and a y^(3),

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.830
for them to all have the same
dimensions,

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.038
they will be divided by some
numbers.

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:09.965
So this y will be
divided by let's say u,

00:13:09.965 --> 00:13:11.248
this will be divided by
u^(2),

00:13:11.248 --> 00:13:12.710
this will be divided by
u^(3).

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:18.053
It's an expansion in a small
parameter, and only when the

00:13:18.053 --> 00:13:21.490
parameter is small will this
work.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:25.605
So you have to notice two
things: in a parabolic mirror an

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:28.782
object at infinity will form a
perfect image,

00:13:28.782 --> 00:13:31.308
no matter how wide the beam is.
 

00:13:31.308 --> 00:13:34.999
But an object at a finite
distance will not form a perfect

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:37.200
image if the object is too tall.
 

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.855
If the height y becomes too
much, then you don't get a good

00:13:40.855 --> 00:13:41.360
image.
 

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.445
But you get a pretty good
image, because the possible

00:13:44.445 --> 00:13:47.590
dependence on y and
y^(2) will be 0,

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.830
but not to arbitrary powers of
y.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.440
Do you understand?
 

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.322
If you have a graph that's a
power series in y, if it

00:13:56.322 --> 00:14:00.460
begins with y^(2) it will
look like this.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.726
If the first non-zero term is
y to the fourth,

00:14:03.726 --> 00:14:07.120
it will look very flat,
but eventually it will move.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.066
The flatter this is,
the further out you can pretend

00:14:10.066 --> 00:14:11.798
nothing depends on y.
 

00:14:11.798 --> 00:14:13.419
So we want to see how far we
can go.

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:14.970
That's the purpose.
 

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:20.195
It will also tell you the
limits of a real mirror for a

00:14:20.195 --> 00:14:21.548
real object.
 

00:14:21.548 --> 00:14:26.428
Any questions on calculation
I'm about to do?

00:14:26.428 --> 00:14:31.009
Okay, before I do the
calculation, you're going to

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:34.001
need the following
approximation:

00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:38.769
u^(2) θ^(2) to the
power ½.

00:14:38.769 --> 00:14:43.259
You're going to get such
combinations all the time.

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:47.429
You can write that as u
times 1 θ^(2) over

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.549
u^(2) to the ½.
 

00:14:49.549 --> 00:14:50.740
That's exact.
 

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.470
Yes?
 

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:56.870
Student: 
&gt;

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.240
Prof: Oh,
R in the top?

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.528
R/2.
 

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:08.364
R stands for the radius
of the sphere from which you cut

00:15:08.364 --> 00:15:09.690
out that piece.
 

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.298
Everybody understands that?
 

00:15:11.298 --> 00:15:17.128
We had a parabola here,
and I'm going to approximate it

00:15:17.128 --> 00:15:23.820
by taking a sphere of some
radius R and that sphere,

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.940
if you look at this portion
here, it looks like a parabola.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.631
You can ask,
"What parabola does it

00:15:28.631 --> 00:15:29.500
approximate?"
 

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.067
I showed you that near the
origin, it looks like a parabola

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.879
whose f = R/2.
 

00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:38.235
So if you take a sphere of
radius R and you slice a

00:15:38.235 --> 00:15:40.633
portion off it and you paint it
with silver so it becomes a

00:15:40.633 --> 00:15:43.082
mirror,
its focal length will be

00:15:43.082 --> 00:15:44.058
R/2.
 

00:15:44.058 --> 00:15:46.269
But it won't be a perfect
parabolic mirror.

00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:48.440
It's an approximate parabolic
mirror.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.548
There are different levels of
approximation.

00:15:50.548 --> 00:15:54.623
A sphere will not focus a
parallel beam even if the beam

00:15:54.623 --> 00:15:55.658
is too wide.
 

00:15:55.658 --> 00:15:58.893
A parabola will focus the
parallel beam no matter how wide

00:15:58.893 --> 00:16:01.389
it is, provided the object is at
infinity.

00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:04.278
If the object comes to a finite
distance, I'm saying even the

00:16:04.278 --> 00:16:06.830
parabolic mirror will not give
you a perfect image.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.927
But if it's very short,
short compared to u and

00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:12.500
v and so on,
it will do a good job.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.120
So let's see how that happens.
 

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.057
So I'm going to need this
approximation that looks like

00:16:18.057 --> 00:16:18.860
u.
 

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.977
now this thing,
I'm going to write as u

00:16:21.977 --> 00:16:25.788
times 1 θ^(2) over
2u squared ...

00:16:25.788 --> 00:16:29.089
θ to the fourth,
u to the fourth,

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:29.470
etc.
 

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.480
I'm going to drop all this.
 

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.970
This is the approximate
expansion, (1 x)^(n) is 1

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:37.950
nx.
 

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:44.610
So that becomes = u
θ^(2) over 2u.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:49.450
So let's bear that in mind.
 

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.994
This is just a mathematical
preliminary I'm getting out of

00:16:51.994 --> 00:16:53.779
the way so we don't get stuck in
that.

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:54.490
Yes?
 

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.928
Student: 
&gt;

00:16:57.928 --> 00:17:02.910
Prof: It was squared
here, but when I multiplied by

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.970
this u,
it got un-squared.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.709
So in this calculation,
I mentioned to you,

00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:11.970
some numbers are big and some
numbers are small.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.420
I said that near the end of the
class.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:21.769
u, v, f are treated as
big numbers.

00:17:21.769 --> 00:17:25.034
Compared to that,
the height h_1

00:17:25.034 --> 00:17:27.859
of the object,
height h_2 of

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:31.034
the image and y, the
height at which the light hits

00:17:31.034 --> 00:17:34.430
the mirror,
they're called small.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.519
And the coordinate x on
that mirror where you hit it is

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:40.599
proportional to y^(2).
 

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:42.130
You remember that?
 

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.828
So it's proportional to small
squared.

00:17:46.828 --> 00:17:52.210
Remember the parabola equation
is x = y^(2)/4f.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.519
In fact, let me write it
exactly.

00:17:54.519 --> 00:17:58.720
You can see that f is a
number that's called--you can

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.493
call these order one numbers,
these are small numbers,

00:18:02.493 --> 00:18:05.200
these are smaller numbers
squared.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.711
So in all these calculations,
I think you have no trouble

00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:10.358
seeing why x is much
smaller than y, right?

00:18:10.358 --> 00:18:13.050
The shape of the parabola is,
if you climb a lot of height,

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.185
you don't move a lot in the
x direction,

00:18:15.185 --> 00:18:16.440
because it's quadratic.
 

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.210
And the square of a small
number is even smaller.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.678
So if y is small,
x, which is

00:18:21.678 --> 00:18:23.269
y^(2), is even smaller.
 

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:26.894
So I want to do this,
because no matter what field of

00:18:26.894 --> 00:18:29.455
life you go into--
well, not every field,

00:18:29.455 --> 00:18:32.161
but in most fields where you
have to do some kind of

00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:34.414
calculation,
whether it's in economics or

00:18:34.414 --> 00:18:36.827
biology or whatever,
you should know how to do

00:18:36.827 --> 00:18:38.190
approximate calculations.
 

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.461
I'm trying to show you how to
do a systematic approximate

00:18:42.461 --> 00:18:43.529
calculation.
 

00:18:43.529 --> 00:18:46.890
Most of the calculations people
do are approximate.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.027
In fact, every calculation ever
done by any physicist is

00:18:50.027 --> 00:18:52.880
approximate, because we're
neglecting something.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.196
You show me one result that you
swear is accurate,

00:18:56.196 --> 00:18:57.009
it is not.
 

00:18:57.009 --> 00:18:59.380
Everything has got corrections.
 

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.672
So we should learn how to find
the big numbers in the problem

00:19:02.672 --> 00:19:05.578
and keep them and how to
organize our calculation,

00:19:05.578 --> 00:19:07.710
if you like,
as a series in small and

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.900
smaller squared and smaller
cubed,

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.890
and you keep a few terms.
 

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:17.086
So let's calculate now the
distance, d_1

00:19:17.086 --> 00:19:19.108
and d_2.
 

00:19:19.108 --> 00:19:21.940
So we'll have to look at the
picture here.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.390
Let me just write down what I
get.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:32.963
d_1 d_2
is going to look like

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:42.630
h_1 - y whole
squared u - x squared.

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:50.320
That is d_1.
And d_2 will be

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:57.130
h_2 y squared
v - x squared.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:01.491
Can you see in that figure in
the right that the right angle

00:20:01.491 --> 00:20:06.150
triangle--maybe I'll bring it
down one more time to show you.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.259
In fact, this is what we really
need, so let's keep it here.

00:20:09.259 --> 00:20:12.637
This whole thing is
h_1. This

00:20:12.637 --> 00:20:16.144
height is y,
so this side is

00:20:16.144 --> 00:20:22.108
h_1 - y,
and this side here is u

00:20:22.108 --> 00:20:24.183
- x,
because u brings you

00:20:24.183 --> 00:20:27.646
from here to the mirror,
but this point is to the right

00:20:27.646 --> 00:20:29.539
by an amount x.
 

00:20:29.539 --> 00:20:31.200
That's this right triangle.
 

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.380
Then there's a second right
angled triangle here to find

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.710
d_2.
 

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:40.063
That height is h_2
y and that distance is again

00:20:40.063 --> 00:20:41.098
v - x.
 

00:20:41.098 --> 00:20:47.588
This is the point v and
this is the point u.

00:20:47.588 --> 00:20:54.337
And I want that to be same as
when the beam goes to this

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:56.670
dotted line here.
 

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.410
That's the y = 0 answer.
 

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.608
That's very easy to do
Pythagoras on that one.

00:21:00.608 --> 00:21:03.574
This dotted square is
h_1^(2) u^(2)

00:21:03.574 --> 00:21:07.223
under root,
and this dotted square =

00:21:07.223 --> 00:21:11.730
h_2^(2) v^(2)
under root.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:25.682
So this whole thing has got to
= h_1^(2) u^(2)

00:21:25.682 --> 00:21:32.900
h_2^(2) v^(2).
 

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.930
So the right hand side does not
depend on y.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.598
Left hand side depends on
y.

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:43.178
In the best of all worlds,
somehow all the y

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:47.041
dependents will magically
cancel, but it's not going to

00:21:47.041 --> 00:21:49.690
happen, I can tell you right
now.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.633
What you will find is that the
term linear in y will

00:21:53.633 --> 00:21:57.779
cancel, the term quadratic and
y can be made to cancel,

00:21:57.779 --> 00:21:59.818
and that's all you can do.
 

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:02.078
So let's now look at these two
things.

00:22:02.078 --> 00:22:03.369
Let me look at the right hand
side.

00:22:03.369 --> 00:22:04.720
It's very easy to do this one.
 

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.538
I only paved the way for this.
 

00:22:06.538 --> 00:22:09.606
Remember, h_1
is a small number,

00:22:09.606 --> 00:22:11.460
u is the big number.
 

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.509
When you do this one,
you will get u

00:22:14.509 --> 00:22:17.640
h_1^(2) over
2u.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.930
You see that?
 

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.367
h^(2) is like
θ^(2) in my

00:22:22.367 --> 00:22:23.150
formula.
 

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:28.460
And this will look like v
h_2^(2) over

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.640
2v.
 

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.972
So the formula I'm using is
u^(2 ) θ^(2) to

00:22:33.972 --> 00:22:38.227
the½ = u θ^(2)
over 2u terms

00:22:38.227 --> 00:22:41.930
involving θ
to the fourth and so on,

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:46.680
which I'm not keeping.
 

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.170
So the right hand side is very
easy to calculate.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:49.900
It's that.
 

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.019
So let's look at the left hand
side now.

00:22:52.019 --> 00:22:55.298
So let me open out everything
in the bracket here.

00:22:55.298 --> 00:23:11.025
I get h_1^(2)
y^(2) - 2h_1y u^(2) -

00:23:11.025 --> 00:23:15.440
2ux x^(2).
 

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:23.027
Now the second guy is
h_2^(2) y^(2 )

00:23:23.027 --> 00:23:29.348
2h_2y v^(2) - 2vx
x^(2).

00:23:29.348 --> 00:23:35.335
That's got to equal the u v
h_1^(2 )over 2u

00:23:35.335 --> 00:23:39.098
h_2^(2) over
2v.

00:23:39.098 --> 00:23:42.909
Remember, the right hand side
is not really--I've put a dot to

00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:44.970
tell you it's an approximation.
 

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.730
This square root goes on
forever.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.410
I've kept the leading,
first leading term.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:55.818
The first leading term happens
to be quadratic in h.

00:23:55.818 --> 00:23:59.904
Quadratic in the small
quantity, so to be consistent,

00:23:59.904 --> 00:24:05.009
I should look at the left hand
side, also to the same accuracy.

00:24:05.009 --> 00:24:08.170
So let's look at the left hand
side here.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:13.800
This is quadratic in the small
guy, quadratic in the small guy,

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.616
small times small,
a big square,

00:24:16.616 --> 00:24:20.160
big times small,
and small squared.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.400
But you've got to be a little
careful.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.109
x is not small;
x is small squared.

00:24:25.109 --> 00:24:25.788
Remember that?
 

00:24:25.788 --> 00:24:27.298
x is proportional to
y^(2).

00:24:27.298 --> 00:24:29.400
This is proportional to
y to the fourth.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.054
You cannot keep a term to
fourth order in the small

00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:35.346
quantity on the left hand side
if you don't keep a similar term

00:24:35.346 --> 00:24:36.779
on the right hand side.
 

00:24:36.779 --> 00:24:40.549
So you systematically drop
things which are quartic in the

00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:41.078
small.
 

00:24:41.078 --> 00:24:45.457
So even though x makes
it, x^(2) doesn't make it

00:24:45.457 --> 00:24:47.180
in this approximation.
 

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:47.900
Yes?
 

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.380
Student: 
&gt;

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.608
Prof: Yeah,
it can be anywhere it wants.

00:24:54.608 --> 00:24:56.468
You may think that because it's
under square root,

00:24:56.468 --> 00:24:58.289
when you take the root of it,
it may become x.

00:24:58.289 --> 00:25:00.009
Is that your worry?
 

00:25:00.009 --> 00:25:01.710
Is that what you're saying?
 

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.230
Student: 
&gt;

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.776
Prof: The point you're
making is, I see an x^(2)

00:25:06.776 --> 00:25:07.568
like that, right?
 

00:25:07.568 --> 00:25:08.652
But it's really not
x^(2);

00:25:08.652 --> 00:25:09.430
it's really x.
 

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:11.338
That's certainly true.
 

00:25:11.338 --> 00:25:14.616
But you're adding a whole bunch
of numbers and then taking the

00:25:14.616 --> 00:25:15.798
square root of that.
 

00:25:15.798 --> 00:25:18.621
In that sum,
these numbers are going to be

00:25:18.621 --> 00:25:22.199
big compared to this one,
whether you take the square

00:25:22.199 --> 00:25:23.920
root r or not.
 

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.819
So it is dominated by the terms
under the same square root.

00:25:27.819 --> 00:25:32.480
That's why you drop it.
 

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.589
Okay, so this fellow is out.
 

00:25:34.589 --> 00:25:37.930
Here's what I want to do now.
 

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.900
I'm going to write the first
thing.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.450
So let's decide what to call
what.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.009
This is my u^(2).
 

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:48.400
The rest of these guys are my
θ^(2).

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.779
You understand that?
 

00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:52.067
Unfortunately,
they're not next to each other,

00:25:52.067 --> 00:25:53.948
but all of that is
θ^(2),

00:25:53.948 --> 00:25:55.220
this is u^(2).
 

00:25:55.220 --> 00:26:04.868
Then the formula tells me,
this = u h_1^(2)

00:26:04.868 --> 00:26:12.587
y^(2) - 2h_1y - 2ux
over u v

00:26:12.587 --> 00:26:22.061
h_2^(2) y^(2)
2h_2y 2vx divided

00:26:22.061 --> 00:26:31.184
by v = u v
h_1^(2) over 2u

00:26:31.184 --> 00:26:39.078
h_2^(2) over
2v.

00:26:39.078 --> 00:26:45.068
This is what I want to this
order.

00:26:45.068 --> 00:26:47.996
Now I have an x
everywhere, but x is not

00:26:47.996 --> 00:26:48.769
independent.
 

00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:54.529
x = y^(2)/4f.
 

00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:57.440
So what is -2ux.
 

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:07.472
-2ux will be
−y^(2) over

00:27:07.472 --> 00:27:13.539
2u over f.
 

00:27:13.539 --> 00:27:14.940
Yes?
 

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.834
Student:  Should the
denominator for those be

00:27:16.834 --> 00:27:17.799
2u and 2v?
 

00:27:17.799 --> 00:27:20.960
Prof: Yes, thank you.
 

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:27.298
Very good.
 

00:27:27.298 --> 00:27:32.990
Okay, therefore--so let's
compare everything.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.535
The big numbers have to cancel
the big numbers,

00:27:36.535 --> 00:27:39.309
otherwise you've got big
problems.

00:27:39.309 --> 00:27:40.640
You guys have a question?
 

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:50.269
Student: 
&gt;

00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:51.788
Prof: It was to
the½,

00:27:51.788 --> 00:27:55.483
but I've taken this
approximation that when you take

00:27:55.483 --> 00:27:57.440
it to the power ½.
 

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.680
Look at the top right.
 

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.065
u^(2) θ^(2) to the
power ½

00:28:02.065 --> 00:28:05.150
is u θ^(2) over
2u.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.598
Okay?
 

00:28:08.598 --> 00:28:12.147
Yes, so I've done this a lot of
times, but I want you to follow

00:28:12.147 --> 00:28:15.124
this, because this is telling
you how to organize the

00:28:15.124 --> 00:28:16.039
calculation.
 

00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:17.190
This is how we organize.
 

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:22.460
We identify quantities which
are quantities of importance,

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.006
and then smaller and smaller
quantities and you balance the

00:28:26.006 --> 00:28:28.380
equation,
starting with the big numbers,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.130
then go to the smaller numbers.
 

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.220
So the big numbers better match.
 

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:38.089
So that tells you u v
matches u v.

00:28:38.089 --> 00:28:39.598
That's fine.
 

00:28:39.598 --> 00:28:44.160
Now take the terms proportional
to y.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.450
They have to separately match.
 

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:49.196
When you have a function of
y, then if it functions

00:28:49.196 --> 00:28:52.682
equal on the two sides,
every power of y should

00:28:52.682 --> 00:28:53.338
match.
 

00:28:53.338 --> 00:28:56.413
Of course, we only have two
powers here and they should both

00:28:56.413 --> 00:28:56.828
match.
 

00:28:56.828 --> 00:28:59.970
So take the term linear in
y from both sides.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.490
Oh, let's get it to one more
stop.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.827
Do you see this
h_1

00:29:04.827 --> 00:29:07.769
^(2)/2u canceled this
one?

00:29:07.769 --> 00:29:10.731
And this h_2
^(2)/2v cancels that

00:29:10.731 --> 00:29:11.049
one.
 

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:13.710
So I've got nothing left.
 

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.676
So everything on the left hand
side should add up to 0,

00:29:16.676 --> 00:29:19.368
because there's nothing on the
right hand side.

00:29:19.368 --> 00:29:23.048
So what do I have to linear
order and y?

00:29:23.048 --> 00:29:27.545
This guy is linear and
y, this guy is linear and

00:29:27.545 --> 00:29:30.460
y and that's all there
is.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:36.032
So the coefficient of y
looks like y times

00:29:36.032 --> 00:29:41.911
-2h_1 over
2u 2h_2

00:29:41.911 --> 00:29:46.368
over 2v and that's got to
vanish.

00:29:46.368 --> 00:29:51.942
And that simply says
h_1/u is

00:29:51.942 --> 00:29:55.038
h_2/v.
 

00:29:55.038 --> 00:29:58.000
So this is what you get by
usual geometric optics

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.740
arguments.
 

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.630
I showed you last time with
similar triangles,

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.759
but it comes from the Principle
of Least Time,

00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:08.430
by demanding that the function,
the time doesn't depend on y,

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.259
to first order and y.
 

00:30:11.259 --> 00:30:13.892
Then I have to do the
y^(2) term,

00:30:13.892 --> 00:30:14.769
understand?
 

00:30:14.769 --> 00:30:19.220
You understand if you've got
numbers on the two sides,

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.298
big numbers,
square of small numbers,

00:30:22.298 --> 00:30:25.380
linear and y,
quadratic and y,

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.230
everything has to match,
order by order.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.769
So this is a linear and
y term.

00:30:29.769 --> 00:30:33.170
What is the quadratic and
y term?

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:36.538
Quadratic and y,
look at the coefficients.

00:30:36.538 --> 00:30:39.450
y^(2) is coefficient
½u.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:41.838
You see that?
 

00:30:41.838 --> 00:30:45.106
And this one has got 1 over
2v, coefficient of

00:30:45.106 --> 00:30:46.048
y^(2).
 

00:30:46.048 --> 00:30:51.386
So I've got 1 over 2u 1
over 2v,

00:30:51.386 --> 00:30:57.078
but then I've got -2ux
and -2vx.

00:30:57.078 --> 00:31:03.490
So what is -2ux,
is −y^(2) u over

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:10.270
2f divided by 2u -
2 y squared v by

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:15.078
2f divided by 2v =
0.

00:31:15.078 --> 00:31:20.490
Student: 
&gt;

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.819
Prof: Yes, I'm sorry.
 

00:31:21.819 --> 00:31:23.490
I'm not being consistent.
 

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:27.109
So let me just call this the
coefficient of y squared.

00:31:27.109 --> 00:31:29.028
Do you agree?
 

00:31:29.028 --> 00:31:30.598
It's the coefficient of the
y^(2).

00:31:30.598 --> 00:31:33.472
If you want,
it's in front of everything,

00:31:33.472 --> 00:31:36.490
all of this is multiplying
y^(2).

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:38.380
So this has to vanish.
 

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:47.003
Okay, so cancel the 2's
everywhere, you get 1/u

00:31:47.003 --> 00:31:49.119
1/v.
 

00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:51.650
This cancels.
 

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:56.460
Let me see.
 

00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:00.048
There is no 2 here,
because 2ux = y^(2)

00:32:00.048 --> 00:32:01.769
u over 2f.
 

00:32:01.769 --> 00:32:03.789
This 2 is not there, sorry.
 

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:05.130
This is all you have.
 

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:13.180
You get -1 over 2f -
another 1 over 2f = 0.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.130
Look guys, we know where we are
going, right?

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:20.028
So it's going to happen.
 

00:32:20.028 --> 00:32:22.836
It's happened for the last 300
years and I'm not going to

00:32:22.836 --> 00:32:24.390
change it, so it will happen.
 

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:27.049
So the 2's will all work out.
 

00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:28.769
What does this tell you?
 

00:32:28.769 --> 00:32:36.098
It tells you 1/u
1/v is 1/f.

00:32:36.098 --> 00:32:39.989
So you can ask,
what's the point of doing this

00:32:39.989 --> 00:32:40.940
exercise?
 

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:46.730
This tells you that because of
the Principle of Least Time,

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.460
the time it takes to go not
only for these two privileged

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.451
rays,
but any ray you can think of

00:32:51.451 --> 00:32:54.140
drawing from here to the mirror
and back here.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:59.442
They all take the same time,
in the approximation in which

00:32:59.442 --> 00:33:02.233
the height over u,
for example,

00:33:02.233 --> 00:33:05.769
to the fourth power,
is neglected.

00:33:05.769 --> 00:33:09.395
Basically, anything that looks
like small over big to the

00:33:09.395 --> 00:33:12.440
fourth power and higher powers
are neglected.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.818
So it's not going to form a
perfect image for everything.

00:33:15.818 --> 00:33:19.143
It will form a perfect image in
a world in which you are able to

00:33:19.143 --> 00:33:21.568
keep the term to leading order
in u,

00:33:21.568 --> 00:33:23.549
to the order
h^(2)/u^(2),

00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:25.140
and stop.
 

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.240
This is an approximate thing.
 

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.415
So for it to successfully work,
you've got to keep your object

00:33:30.415 --> 00:33:33.175
and the image all to be much
smaller than u and

00:33:33.175 --> 00:33:34.529
v and f.
 

00:33:34.529 --> 00:33:35.980
That's the rule.
 

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.442
If you take any parabolic
mirror and you have an object

00:33:39.442 --> 00:33:43.097
which is as tall as the focal
length, it won't form a good

00:33:43.097 --> 00:33:43.740
image.
 

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.605
What it will mean,
what do you think it means not

00:33:46.605 --> 00:33:47.980
to form a good image?
 

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.934
Rays will cross at different
points and you will get a

00:33:51.934 --> 00:33:53.130
blurred image.
 

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:57.548
If you put a screen,
if you put a candle here,

00:33:57.548 --> 00:34:00.116
if that's a candle,
you can actually put a real

00:34:00.116 --> 00:34:03.019
screen here and there'll be a
glow on the screen,

00:34:03.019 --> 00:34:07.470
image of the candle upside down.
 

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:11.659
It will be a very sharp image,
if the candle's not too tall.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:14.605
Once it gets taller,
image will get blurred,

00:34:14.605 --> 00:34:18.099
because the rays will not meet
at the same point.

00:34:18.099 --> 00:34:21.255
All right, I want to do one
other thing, then I'm going to

00:34:21.255 --> 00:34:23.469
stop with the Principle of Least
Time.

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:26.440
That has to do with lenses.
 

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.630
You saw how a mirror does a job.
 

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:30.119
Let's take a lens.
 

00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:40.650
Let's say we have the following
lens.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:44.726
And I have an object which is
infinitesimally tall to begin

00:34:44.726 --> 00:34:45.219
with.
 

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:56.469
And I wanted to form an image
somewhere on the other side.

00:34:56.469 --> 00:35:02.186
So you can ask yourself,
how can the light rays leaving

00:35:02.186 --> 00:35:08.117
this in different directions
arrive here and all take the

00:35:08.117 --> 00:35:09.599
same time?
 

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:13.590
It's clear that this guy is the
shortest path.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:17.851
These are taking longer,
and yet they have to be

00:35:17.851 --> 00:35:21.570
competitive with the one in the
middle.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.389
So how do you think that
happens?

00:35:23.389 --> 00:35:28.389
How do you think they will take
the same time?

00:35:28.389 --> 00:35:29.340
Yes.
 

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:35.369
Student: 
&gt;

00:35:35.369 --> 00:35:36.289
Prof: That's correct.
 

00:35:36.289 --> 00:35:40.001
The answer was,
it is true that this path is

00:35:40.001 --> 00:35:44.920
shorter than one that goes to
the top of the lens and goes

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.460
down here, but this is through
glass.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.164
It's like saying I have a lake
here shaped like this,

00:35:52.164 --> 00:35:56.440
and I tell you to run so that
you go from here to here in the

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.510
least time.
 

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.079
It's not at all clear that
heading straight for the lake is

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:02.340
the best thing to do,
because you've got to swim.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.577
This person doesn't have to
swim at all, but has to go

00:36:05.577 --> 00:36:06.190
further.
 

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:10.958
You can imagine somehow cooking
things up so that they all take

00:36:10.958 --> 00:36:12.190
the same time.
 

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.280
So I'm going to do it only for
the two extreme rays.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.003
Since I've done a lot of
algebra, I don't want to keep

00:36:17.003 --> 00:36:17.570
doing it.
 

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:25.135
So let us say this height is
h, height of the lens,

00:36:25.135 --> 00:36:32.039
and this distance is u,
this distance is v.

00:36:32.039 --> 00:36:37.349
And the refractive index is n
of the lens.

00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:42.300
What that means is,
1 meter in air--I'm sorry.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.989
1 meter in glass is like
n meters in the air,

00:36:45.989 --> 00:36:49.030
you understand,
in terms of travel time.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.710
Everybody with me?
 

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.349
That's what it means to say it
goes slower.

00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:55.329
So a meter of lens is worth
n meters of air.

00:36:55.329 --> 00:36:58.440
That's the consequence of the
velocity of light.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.480
We're trying to find equal
times, so when it travels here,

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.230
it travels with a velocity
c/n,

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.809
therefore the time it takes,
when you divide the distance by

00:37:06.809 --> 00:37:10.159
time,
will be n times as big.

00:37:10.159 --> 00:37:12.829
Okay, then there's one other
result I'm going to need,

00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:15.599
so I don't want to interrupt
you later,

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:20.780
which is the following:
I'll take this glass here,

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:24.648
this face of the lens,
and let's say it is coming from

00:37:24.648 --> 00:37:26.840
a sphere of radius R.
 

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:33.599
So that's the center of the
sphere.

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:40.068
And draw a normal here and call
that distance delta and call

00:37:40.068 --> 00:37:42.590
this height h.
 

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:44.219
This is all exaggerated.
 

00:37:44.219 --> 00:37:48.289
In reality, delta's a very
small number.

00:37:48.289 --> 00:37:53.251
I'm going to need an
approximate formula for delta in

00:37:53.251 --> 00:37:56.400
terms of h and R.
 

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:02.650
So since it's a sphere,
that distance is also R.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:03.829
Right?
 

00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:07.132
This is a sphere of radius
R from which I've cut out

00:38:07.132 --> 00:38:09.809
that portion,
which is this face of the lens.

00:38:09.809 --> 00:38:13.737
The lens ends here,
but the mental sphere can keep

00:38:13.737 --> 00:38:15.179
going like that.
 

00:38:15.179 --> 00:38:17.969
So what can you say about this
distance delta?

00:38:17.969 --> 00:38:19.309
You can say the following?
 

00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:27.929
delta = R - this side.
 

00:38:27.929 --> 00:38:31.590
So let's write the formula this
side, which I don't know,

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.268
let's say is l,
is R - l.

00:38:34.268 --> 00:38:44.969
But we also know that l^(2)
h^(2 )= R^(2).

00:38:44.969 --> 00:38:52.349
Therefore l^(2) = R^(2)
− h^(2),

00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:57.920
or l is square root of
R^(2) −

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.911
h^(2),
and by the same trick I did,

00:39:01.911 --> 00:39:05.739
it is R −
h^(2) over 2R.

00:39:05.739 --> 00:39:11.619
The same θ^(2) formula.
 

00:39:11.619 --> 00:39:16.391
So l is shorter than R
by an amount h^(2)/2R,

00:39:16.391 --> 00:39:19.190
so this delta =
h^(2)/2R.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:24.909
That's the formula I'm going to
invoke.

00:39:24.909 --> 00:39:28.320
You will see why I bother to
prove that in a minute.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:34.744
So you should now think about
what equation you will write

00:39:34.744 --> 00:39:36.210
down, okay?
 

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:41.083
I'm going to give you a few
seconds to think about what two

00:39:41.083 --> 00:39:44.639
things should be equal,
for the condition that

00:39:44.639 --> 00:39:48.315
everything takes the same amount
of time to go from start to

00:39:48.315 --> 00:39:48.940
finish.
 

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.492
So first I'm going to find the
time it takes to go on that

00:39:52.492 --> 00:39:53.489
straight line.
 

00:39:53.489 --> 00:39:56.304
By the way, since I'm going to
divide by velocity everywhere to

00:39:56.304 --> 00:39:58.358
get time,
distance is all you need,

00:39:58.358 --> 00:40:01.498
except here you've got to
remember 1 inch of glass is

00:40:01.498 --> 00:40:03.070
n inches of air.
 

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.579
If you remember that,
you'll be fine.

00:40:04.579 --> 00:40:07.260
So let's see how long is that
path.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:15.786
That path = square root of
u^(2) h^(2) square root

00:40:15.786 --> 00:40:19.440
of v^(2) h^(2).
 

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:23.063
By right angle,
this right angle triangle,

00:40:23.063 --> 00:40:27.570
that right angle triangle,
very easy to get that.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:33.398
And that's going to = the
effective length going straight

00:40:33.398 --> 00:40:34.440
through.
 

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.760
So let's look at the effective
length in two portions.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.487
That's a segment here of size
delta and a segment there of

00:40:43.487 --> 00:40:45.699
size delta in glass.
 

00:40:45.699 --> 00:40:48.320
So let's look at the distance
in the air first.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:52.536
Distance in the air is u
- delta on the left v -

00:40:52.536 --> 00:40:53.989
delta on the right.
 

00:40:53.989 --> 00:40:55.900
That's the air distance.
 

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.539
Now I've got to add to that 2
delta times n.

00:41:00.539 --> 00:41:02.030
That's what you have to
remember.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:04.409
That's the only non trivial
part of this,

00:41:04.409 --> 00:41:06.434
is that this distance,
2 delta, is should be

00:41:06.434 --> 00:41:09.820
multiplied by n,
because you're traveling at a

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.099
speed reduced by n in
terms of time.

00:41:13.099 --> 00:41:16.079
It's the distance factor
increase by n.

00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:29.679
So this becomes u v 2
delta times n - 1.

00:41:29.679 --> 00:41:30.619
That's the right hand side.
 

00:41:30.619 --> 00:41:35.699
The left hand side,
it's u h^(2) over

00:41:35.699 --> 00:41:40.659
2u v h^(2) over
2v.

00:41:40.659 --> 00:41:42.469
Again, in the same
approximation,

00:41:42.469 --> 00:41:44.338
in the quantity
h_2/u

00:41:44.338 --> 00:41:46.487
_2, or
h_2/v

00:41:46.487 --> 00:41:47.789
_2.
 

00:41:47.789 --> 00:41:51.284
There are higher powers of
h/v which I'm not keeping

00:41:51.284 --> 00:41:52.309
in either side.
 

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:55.590
Even here, there are higher
powers of h/R that I'm

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:56.409
not keeping.
 

00:41:56.409 --> 00:41:58.789
So get used to the notion, okay?
 

00:41:58.789 --> 00:42:01.019
u, v, f, R, big.
 

00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:03.110
h, y, etc.
 

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.489
are small.
 

00:42:05.489 --> 00:42:12.719
So you cancel the u and
the v.

00:42:12.719 --> 00:42:14.559
Write the formula for delta.
 

00:42:14.559 --> 00:42:22.800
Delta = h^(2)/2r.
 

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.380
I'm sorry, did I make a mistake
here?

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.369
I guess not.
 

00:42:29.369 --> 00:42:37.179
Okay.
 

00:42:37.179 --> 00:42:46.570
So you compare the two sides,
you find 1/u 1/v.

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:49.586
In other words,
drop these 2's and cancel the

00:42:49.586 --> 00:42:51.369
h^(2) everywhere.
 

00:42:51.369 --> 00:42:59.351
And 1/u 1/v = 2
times n - 1 over

00:42:59.351 --> 00:43:08.559
R, which I'm free to
write as 1/f if I like.

00:43:08.559 --> 00:43:10.469
In fact, that will be
1/f.

00:43:10.469 --> 00:43:13.489
How do I know that it's
1/f, can you tell me?

00:43:13.489 --> 00:43:24.800
Why should I call this quantity
that I get as 1/f?

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.489
It is what I got,
but my question is,

00:43:27.489 --> 00:43:30.030
what allows me to identify
that?

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:37.719
Student: 
&gt;

00:43:37.719 --> 00:43:41.608
Prof: Remember,
v is not the focal

00:43:41.608 --> 00:43:42.268
point.
 

00:43:42.268 --> 00:43:45.547
v is the location of the
image and u is the

00:43:45.547 --> 00:43:47.010
location of the object.
 

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.780
But what do you want the focal
point to be?

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:53.409
What's the definition of the
focal point?

00:43:53.409 --> 00:43:54.360
How is it defined?
 

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.313
If you had a lens and I said,
"What's the focal

00:43:56.313 --> 00:43:56.849
point?"
 

00:43:56.849 --> 00:43:59.320
how will you find it?
 

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.989
Haven't you guys played with
ants when you were kid with a

00:44:01.989 --> 00:44:02.880
magnifying glass?
 

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:05.969
Come on, what's the focal point?
 

00:44:05.969 --> 00:44:09.210
Where a parallel set of rays
will converge on the ant.

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:14.579
So if you send rays from
infinity, if u =

00:44:14.579 --> 00:44:19.949
infinity, v should be the
focal point.

00:44:19.949 --> 00:44:22.161
If u is infinity,
you drop this guy,

00:44:22.161 --> 00:44:24.269
then v,
the image should be at the

00:44:24.269 --> 00:44:27.010
focal point, therefore
1/v is 1/f.

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:30.487
That's what allows you to
identify then this quantity as

00:44:30.487 --> 00:44:31.309
1/f.
 

00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:33.706
Because in the limit,
u goes to infinity,

00:44:33.706 --> 00:44:36.411
1/v should equal
1/f, and therefore this

00:44:36.411 --> 00:44:37.329
is what it is.
 

00:44:37.329 --> 00:44:40.130
But this is a calculation of
the focal length.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:40.929
See there are two things.
 

00:44:40.929 --> 00:44:43.983
One can define focal length
operationally by saying take a

00:44:43.983 --> 00:44:46.929
lens, send a parallel beam,
see where it all focuses.

00:44:46.929 --> 00:44:48.289
That's the focal length.
 

00:44:48.289 --> 00:44:51.789
But you can also calculate it
from first principles by saying,

00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:56.139
if I made a lens whose faces
are cut out of spheres,

00:44:56.139 --> 00:44:58.730
the two phases,
of radius of curvature

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:01.094
R,
and the refractive index of the

00:45:01.094 --> 00:45:04.157
glass is n,
then I can actually calculate

00:45:04.157 --> 00:45:08.099
the focal length in terms of the
radius of curvature and

00:45:08.099 --> 00:45:08.960
n.
 

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.074
So one is a derivation of the
focal length in terms of other

00:45:12.074 --> 00:45:15.076
given parameters,
whereas parallel rays focusing

00:45:15.076 --> 00:45:18.320
at f is the definition of
the focal point.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.530
It doesn't tell you how to
calculate it for a lens.

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:21.909
But this will tell you.
 

00:45:21.909 --> 00:45:25.190
So if you've got a focal length
that is too big or too small,

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:28.199
you can vary it by varying
either n or by varying

00:45:28.199 --> 00:45:28.909
R.
 

00:45:28.909 --> 00:45:32.043
You can take different
materials or you can take

00:45:32.043 --> 00:45:34.110
different radii of curvature.
 

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.320
Question, yes?
 

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.088
Student:  In that
drawing of the lens,

00:45:39.088 --> 00:45:41.059
what is the f?
 

00:45:41.059 --> 00:45:42.639
Prof: Which one?
 

00:45:42.639 --> 00:45:46.929
Student:  In the drawing
of the lens, what is the little

00:45:46.929 --> 00:45:47.690
f?
 

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:48.690
Prof: This little
f?

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:55.170
Student: 
&gt;

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.590
Prof: You want to know
what f means?

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:57.780
Student:  Yes.
 

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:03.288
Prof: It means take this
lens and send a beam from

00:46:03.288 --> 00:46:04.369
infinity.
 

00:46:04.369 --> 00:46:07.619
That means it comes in parallel
rays.

00:46:07.619 --> 00:46:12.204
That means u = infinity
and 1/v then becomes

00:46:12.204 --> 00:46:13.250
1/f.
 

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:15.170
That means v = f.
 

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:21.150
v is the image point,
so that f will be here.

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:32.800
So that's what it means.
 

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:37.626
Okay, so I've gotten these
formulas, spent a lot of time

00:46:37.626 --> 00:46:39.030
deriving them.
 

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:43.420
I'm assuming you have used them
a lot in your younger days.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.260
I just want to give you a few
examples,

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.590
but I don't want to do all of
them,

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:51.577
because you can do endless
calculations involving

00:46:51.577 --> 00:46:54.820
1/u 1/v is
1/f,

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.309
just punching in numbers.
 

00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:59.340
I will just tell you a couple
of things to bear in mind.

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.349
Then I want to sort of wrap it
up.

00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:05.340
So let's take some examples.
 

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:14.409
Let's take this focusing mirror
now.

00:47:14.409 --> 00:47:17.710
This is f and this is
2f.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:23.170
So let's see what happens when
I start with an object here.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.197
You should be able to sort of
draw the ray diagrams,

00:47:25.197 --> 00:47:26.829
and I'm just drawing you a few
of them.

00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:29.847
So from now on,
we quit Fermat's Principle of

00:47:29.847 --> 00:47:30.739
Least Time.
 

00:47:30.739 --> 00:47:32.771
We just go back to the usual
diagrammatics,

00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:35.628
having convinced ourselves it
all follows from the Principle

00:47:35.628 --> 00:47:36.500
of Least Time.
 

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.329
So you don't want to go back to
that every time.

00:47:39.329 --> 00:47:41.739
So what will be the situation
here?

00:47:41.739 --> 00:47:43.849
You need only two rays to draw.
 

00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:46.929
So one ray, you draw a
horizontal ray,

00:47:46.929 --> 00:47:51.260
and you know that will go
through the focal point.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.530
That's the definition.
 

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:56.360
Then you draw a ray through the
focal point.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:01.469
That will come out horizontal,
and again, why is that true?

00:48:01.469 --> 00:48:04.934
That's true because if you sent
a parallel ray at this point,

00:48:04.934 --> 00:48:07.996
it will go to the focal point,
and if it ends up here,

00:48:07.996 --> 00:48:09.960
then the reverse is also true.
 

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.599
Any ray that's possible,
then the time reversed version

00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:16.804
of that's also possible,
because if one takes the least

00:48:16.804 --> 00:48:19.751
time to go from A to B,
other takes the least time to

00:48:19.751 --> 00:48:20.739
go from B to A.
 

00:48:20.739 --> 00:48:25.719
That's how you draw this and
they intersect somewhere here.

00:48:25.719 --> 00:48:29.250
In fact, one can show that if
you're to the right of

00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:32.769
2f,
the image will be to the left

00:48:32.769 --> 00:48:37.739
of 2f.  If you're
exactly at 2f,

00:48:37.739 --> 00:48:40.769
you can show the image will
also be at 2f.

00:48:40.769 --> 00:48:42.320
Let's see why.
 

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:47.929
Now 1/u 1/v is
1/f.

00:48:47.929 --> 00:48:51.981
I'm saying if u is at
2f and I believe v

00:48:51.981 --> 00:48:54.614
is at 2f,
I get them to add up to

00:48:54.614 --> 00:48:56.909
1/f, so that's correct.
 

00:48:56.909 --> 00:49:00.900
So 2f is the point where
the image and the object cross.

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:04.550
See, objects at infinity focus
on f.

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:08.963
As you move the object to find
a distance, the image moves away

00:49:08.963 --> 00:49:12.239
and they cross when you put it
at 2f.

00:49:12.239 --> 00:49:14.641
Then you can of course go
closer than 2f and you

00:49:14.641 --> 00:49:16.820
can ask, "Now what image
will I get?"

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:20.230
So maybe I'll draw one more
picture for that one.

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:22.820
So this is closer than
2f.

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:27.221
Closer than 2f but more
distant than f,

00:49:27.221 --> 00:49:28.659
something here.
 

00:49:28.659 --> 00:49:34.005
So draw that ray,
draw it parallel,

00:49:34.005 --> 00:49:40.608
draw that ray,
draw that and they will meet

00:49:40.608 --> 00:49:42.809
like this.
 

00:49:42.809 --> 00:49:45.780
And finally,
if the object is at f,

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:50.197
the image will be at infinity,
because that's just the reverse

00:49:50.197 --> 00:49:52.010
of the other picture.
 

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:54.230
If all the rays from infinity
focus here,

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:56.777
if you put an object at the
focal point and run the lines

00:49:56.777 --> 00:49:58.715
backwards,
they'll go in parallel,

00:49:58.715 --> 00:50:00.059
so they'll never meet.
 

00:50:00.059 --> 00:50:02.739
They're trying to meet at
infinity.

00:50:02.739 --> 00:50:05.260
But of course,
you can also take an object,

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.559
even closer to the mirror than
the distance f.

00:50:08.559 --> 00:50:10.469
That's what I want to talk
about now.

00:50:10.469 --> 00:50:14.469
What if you go even closer than
f, so let's try that.

00:50:14.469 --> 00:50:27.789
So here it is, same guy.
 

00:50:27.789 --> 00:50:29.389
This is f.
 

00:50:29.389 --> 00:50:36.050
I want to take an object here.
 

00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:42.219
So the first ray I can draw is
the parallel ray going through

00:50:42.219 --> 00:50:42.940
that.
 

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.710
First of all,
when you do the algebra,

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:46.050
you can see some problems.
 

00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:52.873
1/u 1/v is
1/f, therefore 1/v

00:50:52.873 --> 00:50:57.139
is 1/f −
1/u.

00:50:57.139 --> 00:51:01.768
But if u is smaller than
f, 1/u is larger

00:51:01.768 --> 00:51:04.501
than f,
and 1/f −

00:51:04.501 --> 00:51:06.929
1/u will be negative.
 

00:51:06.929 --> 00:51:11.440
That means v itself will
be negative.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.159
So v is the location of
the image,

00:51:14.159 --> 00:51:16.061
and it's negative,
which means on the other side

00:51:16.061 --> 00:51:17.246
of the mirror,
you can ask,

00:51:17.246 --> 00:51:18.739
how can light go to the other
side?

00:51:18.739 --> 00:51:21.961
It doesn't go to the other
side, but you will see that it

00:51:21.961 --> 00:51:25.530
looks like something is behind
the mirror on the other side.

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:28.219
So let's see why that happens.
 

00:51:28.219 --> 00:51:30.539
You will have some difficulty
drawing the second ray.

00:51:30.539 --> 00:51:33.824
Remember, the second ray you
draw through the focal point,

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:35.900
and you say it comes out
parallel.

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:39.155
If I draw a ray through the
focal point, now I've got to go

00:51:39.155 --> 00:51:39.829
backwards.
 

00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:43.686
Previously, you drew an object
and you drew a line through the

00:51:43.686 --> 00:51:47.670
focal point heading towards the
mirror, where the focal point is

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:48.619
behind you.
 

00:51:48.619 --> 00:51:49.860
So what's the fate of this?
 

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:50.940
Here is what you do.
 

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:55.764
Continue it backwards and I
claim it will come out like

00:51:55.764 --> 00:51:56.389
this.
 

00:51:56.389 --> 00:51:59.150
Why do I know that is correct?
 

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.710
Because I know the reverse of
that is correct.

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:03.413
In other words,
a parallel ray,

00:52:03.413 --> 00:52:06.025
going like this will end up at
the focal point,

00:52:06.025 --> 00:52:08.239
therefore this is to guide the
eye.

00:52:08.239 --> 00:52:11.849
If you want to know what
happens with one particular ray,

00:52:11.849 --> 00:52:15.331
join it to the focal point,
hit the mirror and come out

00:52:15.331 --> 00:52:16.300
horizontal.
 

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.949
That's how you do the ray
diagram.

00:52:17.949 --> 00:52:20.467
So this is a little delicate
thing, where if you really went

00:52:20.467 --> 00:52:22.559
to the focal point,
you'd never hit the mirror.

00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:25.452
You just do that to get the
direction, but you continue the

00:52:25.452 --> 00:52:27.349
other way and you come out
parallel.

00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:29.900
And the logic is,
if I draw it backwards,

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.429
I know that's correct.
 

00:52:31.429 --> 00:52:33.309
But now look what's happening.
 

00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:36.579
These rays are not focusing
anywhere.

00:52:36.579 --> 00:52:40.550
In fact, this ray seems to come
from somewhere in that

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:41.449
direction.
 

00:52:41.449 --> 00:52:47.295
That ray seems to come out in
that direction and the two of

00:52:47.295 --> 00:52:49.010
them meet here.
 

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:52.570
That means to a person looking
from here,

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:56.400
from this side with the eye,
the two rays,

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.827
when you extend them backwards,
seem to emanate from this

00:52:59.827 --> 00:53:02.003
point,
so it will look like there is a

00:53:02.003 --> 00:53:05.139
candle behind the mirror,
emitting.

00:53:05.139 --> 00:53:07.789
So that's a virtual image.
 

00:53:07.789 --> 00:53:13.465
So virtual image is when there
is no real image,

00:53:13.465 --> 00:53:20.230
but everything seems to come
from a point behind that.

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:25.733
Here's another variation they
probably exposed you to in high

00:53:25.733 --> 00:53:26.559
school.
 

00:53:26.559 --> 00:53:40.284
That is, what if I have a
mirror like this and I sent some

00:53:40.284 --> 00:53:47.510
parallel rays into that guy.
 

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:49.980
You agreed this was not a
focusing lens.

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.722
It's not a focusing mirror,
because you can already see,

00:53:53.722 --> 00:53:57.260
this light ray will come here,
take off like that.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.289
That ray will go right back.
 

00:53:59.289 --> 00:54:03.809
This will come here,
take off like this.

00:54:03.809 --> 00:54:09.460
So it is not a converging lens.
 

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:13.719
But what is true is that if you
extrapolated all these lines

00:54:13.719 --> 00:54:17.329
backwards, they seem to emanate
from this point.

00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:18.039
You understand?
 

00:54:18.039 --> 00:54:20.690
If you look from the other
side, if you have a sun,

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:23.074
and the sun is forming--sending
parallel rays,

00:54:23.074 --> 00:54:25.090
the image of the sun will be
here.

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:27.110
It will be behind the mirror.
 

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:29.989
It will all seem to be coming
from here.

00:54:29.989 --> 00:54:34.853
So instead of the lines
actually meeting at one point,

00:54:34.853 --> 00:54:38.340
they'll seem to come from one
point.

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.820
So that's what happens.
 

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:42.139
But how do you do the
calculations in this problem?

00:54:42.139 --> 00:54:45.619
Does anybody know?
 

00:54:45.619 --> 00:54:51.090
What's the mirror equation with
this problem?

00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:51.840
Pardon me?
 

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.030
Student: 
&gt;

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:55.369
Prof: Yes,
you say f is negative.

00:54:55.369 --> 00:54:58.190
It will turn out that
everything will work out,

00:54:58.190 --> 00:55:01.849
1/u 1/v is still
1/f,

00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:03.800
but if you want,
you can write this 1 over mod

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.048
f,
because this will be a problem

00:55:06.048 --> 00:55:09.228
where the focal length,
if that is 5 inches,

00:55:09.228 --> 00:55:12.269
f should be treated as -5
inches,

00:55:12.269 --> 00:55:18.949
then everything will work out.
 

00:55:18.949 --> 00:55:26.949
Similarly, a lens which looks
like this is a diverging lens.

00:55:26.949 --> 00:55:33.389
If you send a parallel beam,
it will spread out like that.

00:55:33.389 --> 00:55:37.463
But to a person on the other
side, everything will seem to

00:55:37.463 --> 00:55:39.250
come from a point here.
 

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:43.331
You can do that lens again by
using focal length to be

00:55:43.331 --> 00:55:44.179
negative.
 

00:55:44.179 --> 00:55:48.105
So u and v and
f are positive for a

00:55:48.105 --> 00:55:51.887
certain standard Mickey Mouse
problem where you have a

00:55:51.887 --> 00:55:55.670
focusing lens and u
bigger than f,

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:58.510
then v is positive and
everything is positive.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:01.565
But you can then move around in
this world of parameters where

00:56:01.565 --> 00:56:02.969
v becomes negative.
 

00:56:02.969 --> 00:56:05.239
That means it's a virtual image.
 

00:56:05.239 --> 00:56:07.494
u is never negative,
because you put the object

00:56:07.494 --> 00:56:09.800
where you like,
and you can also have the focal

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.590
length being negative if the
lens,

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:16.067
instead of being a focusing
one, is a convex one that causes

00:56:16.067 --> 00:56:20.519
divergence,
or a lens which is causing

00:56:20.519 --> 00:56:27.170
divergence also is described by
f negative.

00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:30.630
Okay, there's one interesting
point.

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:32.590
You can take it or leave it,
so relax.

00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:35.965
Don't kill yourself over this,
but I thought I should mention

00:56:35.965 --> 00:56:37.989
it to you, which is the
following.

00:56:37.989 --> 00:56:46.932
Suppose I have a lens like
this, and people tell you it's

00:56:46.932 --> 00:56:53.960
going to all seem to come from
this point.

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:56.730
How do we know that's true?
 

00:56:56.730 --> 00:57:00.710
You cannot use the Principle of
Least Time to argue.

00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:04.369
Principle of Least Time says if
you have same starting point and

00:57:04.369 --> 00:57:07.389
the same ending point,
then there can be many ways to

00:57:07.389 --> 00:57:07.969
reach.
 

00:57:07.969 --> 00:57:09.929
Then you have a focusing effect.
 

00:57:09.929 --> 00:57:12.969
But here, there is no end point
where they all come.

00:57:12.969 --> 00:57:14.420
They don't ever come to the
same point.

00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:17.239
They seem to be coming from
here, but the rays never meet.

00:57:17.239 --> 00:57:20.608
So starting from infinity,
you cannot na�vely use the

00:57:20.608 --> 00:57:22.230
Principle of Least Time.
 

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:26.150
But I'll tell you why this is
still going to be the correct

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.760
answer.
 

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:30.909
Take any mirror surface you
like, some part of a mirror.

00:57:30.909 --> 00:57:32.920
That's the normal to that
mirror.

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:36.389
Imagine that a light ray does
that.

00:57:36.389 --> 00:57:41.210
This is the silver side of the
mirror.

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:44.697
And I ask you,
what if I silver this side and

00:57:44.697 --> 00:57:48.820
shine light from the other side,
what will happen?

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:53.463
I claim the answer is that if
you continue this ray here and

00:57:53.463 --> 00:57:57.478
continue that ray there,
then that's what light rays

00:57:57.478 --> 00:58:00.550
coming from the other side will
do.

00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:02.489
Why is that?
 

00:58:02.489 --> 00:58:07.940
Because this light ray had i
= r.

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:09.820
You know that.
 

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.811
But the normal to this surface
is the same normal on the other

00:58:13.811 --> 00:58:17.543
side, and by opposite angles
being equal, this is i

00:58:17.543 --> 00:58:19.179
and this is r.
 

00:58:19.179 --> 00:58:23.701
Therefore in any mirror coated
one way, if you continue the

00:58:23.701 --> 00:58:27.519
lines to the other side,
they'll still obey i =

00:58:27.519 --> 00:58:28.300
r.
 

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:32.447
Consequently,
take the following problem:

00:58:32.447 --> 00:58:37.010
take the focusing mirror coated
like this.

00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:40.750
We know these lines will come
and join here.

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:42.750
Then use the result I showed
you.

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:47.083
That will then show you that
the mirror image of that on the

00:58:47.083 --> 00:58:50.170
other side will also obey i =
r,

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:53.090
because if you draw the normal
here,

00:58:53.090 --> 00:58:56.320
if these two angles are equal,
those two angles will be equal.

00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.802
Therefore I know this will lead
to that and that will match this

00:59:00.802 --> 00:59:01.230
one.
 

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:03.795
Therefore rays coming this way
will go there,

00:59:03.795 --> 00:59:06.768
but this one continued,
we know goes to f.

00:59:06.768 --> 00:59:09.840
That's the reason why,
if you know the fate of one

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.722
kind of mirror,
you can find the fate if you do

00:59:12.722 --> 00:59:14.289
it on the other face.
 

00:59:14.289 --> 00:59:16.646
And this is the construction
that tells you why,

00:59:16.646 --> 00:59:19.405
if you shine light from the
right, they will all seem to

00:59:19.405 --> 00:59:20.659
come from this point.
 

00:59:20.659 --> 00:59:22.079
That's something optional.
 

00:59:22.079 --> 00:59:25.007
You can take it or leave it,
but I wanted to tell you where

00:59:25.007 --> 00:59:26.268
that result comes from.
 

00:59:26.268 --> 00:59:29.574
If you just do the algebra,
everything will work out if

00:59:29.574 --> 00:59:32.755
f is negative,
but you need to know why that's

00:59:32.755 --> 00:59:33.980
a valid picture.
 

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:39.960
Okay, so there's one final
gadget I want to talk about,

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.949
and that's the human eye.
 

00:59:42.949 --> 00:59:47.996
So the human eye is pretty
impressive when you consider the

00:59:47.996 --> 00:59:49.909
following situation.
 

00:59:49.909 --> 00:59:55.969
So here you've got--look,
I don't want to even try this.

00:59:55.969 --> 01:00:01.119
I'm just going to focus on the
lens in the human eye.

01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:09.250
Here are the eyebrows and here
is my cornea over there.

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:11.619
And you put some object here.
 

01:00:11.619 --> 01:00:17.389
It goes and forms an inverted
image somewhere here.

01:00:17.389 --> 01:00:20.568
You must know that the image of
everything you see is actually

01:00:20.568 --> 01:00:22.599
physically upside down in your
brain.

01:00:22.599 --> 01:00:24.719
Did you know that?
 

01:00:24.719 --> 01:00:26.170
Or you did not know that.
 

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:28.869
That's a very operationally
well defined thing.

01:00:28.869 --> 01:00:33.755
If I can look into your cornea,
I look at the candles upright

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:38.802
here, the candle flame is here,
the flame of the candle will be

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:40.349
here like that.
 

01:00:40.349 --> 01:00:44.643
But it doesn't seem to bother
us, because where do you really

01:00:44.643 --> 01:00:45.789
see something?
 

01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:46.630
It's not very clear.
 

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:49.619
Do we see it in the cornea or
do you see it in the brain?

01:00:49.619 --> 01:00:52.351
There's a 1:1 correlation
between what's registered in the

01:00:52.351 --> 01:00:54.510
cornea and what I run into in my
real life.

01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:57.260
I'm walking around,
I bump into the upside down

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:57.739
table.
 

01:00:57.739 --> 01:00:59.360
After the while,
the fact that it's upside down

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.489
in the cornea is not relevant.
 

01:01:00.489 --> 01:01:03.219
I know if I take two steps,
I'm going to hit this object.

01:01:03.219 --> 01:01:06.963
The brain has learned how to
translate that into what you

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:08.099
will encounter.
 

01:01:08.099 --> 01:01:10.599
In fact, I'm told in some
bizarre experiment,

01:01:10.599 --> 01:01:14.063
they put glasses on people so
that everything got inverted one

01:01:14.063 --> 01:01:14.860
more time.
 

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:18.949
And after a few days,
those guys were just fine.

01:01:18.949 --> 01:01:21.289
So the eye has got a lot of
software.

01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:25.369
It's not purely hardware,
but software.

01:01:25.369 --> 01:01:28.186
I learned it the hard way when
I had an eye operation and the

01:01:28.186 --> 01:01:30.909
doctor pulled out the stuff and
said, "Ta-da!"

01:01:30.909 --> 01:01:32.900
and I couldn't see anything.
 

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.489
So I was in a panic.
 

01:01:34.489 --> 01:01:36.699
My doctor didn't seem
particularly worried,

01:01:36.699 --> 01:01:38.909
and I said, "Are you
worried?"

01:01:38.909 --> 01:01:40.958
He said, "No,
no, you'll be fine in a few

01:01:40.958 --> 01:01:41.550
days."
 

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:45.360
Now I've heard that before so I
didn't believe that lie.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.469
But slowly, I got better and
better.

01:01:48.469 --> 01:01:51.530
So it's not that my eye was
operated any more.

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:54.264
He already fixed it,
but the brain began to

01:01:54.264 --> 01:01:57.518
reprogram it with respect to the
new parameters.

01:01:57.518 --> 01:02:00.815
You change the parameters of
the eye and he reprogrammed it

01:02:00.815 --> 01:02:03.996
so the brain had to correlate
everything that it saw with

01:02:03.996 --> 01:02:06.610
everything that's registered in
the brain.

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:08.130
So you just need to 1:1 map.
 

01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:10.300
You can flip it any way you
like.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.318
You can flip it once,
or twice or any number of

01:02:12.318 --> 01:02:12.670
times.
 

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:14.739
After a while,
you will learn how to use it.

01:02:14.739 --> 01:02:17.010
But that's not the only
impressive thing.

01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:23.170
If you have an object here,
you go to the Lens equation.

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:29.188
You want the image to be at
that distance,

01:02:29.188 --> 01:02:33.300
and that's not negotiable.
 

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:37.659
The distance from your lens to
your retina is fixed.

01:02:37.659 --> 01:02:42.422
So no matter what you have,
as u varies,

01:02:42.422 --> 01:02:47.702
you want v to be fixed
to obey this equation,

01:02:47.702 --> 01:02:52.570
so how do you think that's
going to happen?

01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:54.159
Pardon me?
 

01:02:54.159 --> 01:02:56.000
You've got to change f.
 

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.668
You've got to change the focal
length of the lens,

01:02:58.668 --> 01:03:01.335
and that's the amazing thing
about the human lens,

01:03:01.335 --> 01:03:03.460
is that it's not made out of
glass.

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:08.070
It's made out of some jelly
like stuff, and there are some

01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:09.768
muscles pulling it.
 

01:03:09.768 --> 01:03:11.989
And if the muscles pull it,
it will become longer and

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:13.739
thinner, it will have one focal
length.

01:03:13.739 --> 01:03:16.065
If they relax,
it will have another focal

01:03:16.065 --> 01:03:16.590
length.
 

01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:20.664
So as I look at an object which
is very far, that's the normal

01:03:20.664 --> 01:03:22.469
relaxed state of the eye.
 

01:03:22.469 --> 01:03:25.697
As the object comes closer,
it takes a certain effort to

01:03:25.697 --> 01:03:28.456
focus on the object,
to keep reading whatever is

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:29.630
coming near you.
 

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:33.271
And that's the process in which
your eye is trying to change its

01:03:33.271 --> 01:03:34.139
focal length.
 

01:03:34.139 --> 01:03:37.429
But it cannot do more than some
amount.

01:03:37.429 --> 01:03:41.431
The eye cannot focus anything
that is closer than a certain

01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:43.710
distance called the near point.
 

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:47.539
And the near point is 25
centimeters, well,

01:03:47.539 --> 01:03:49.000
approximately.
 

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.887
This is not a law of nature,
but this number has crept into

01:03:52.887 --> 01:03:54.230
all the textbooks.
 

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:57.800
So 25 centimeters is all you
can do.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.797
See, if you didn't have the
limitation, you don't need

01:04:00.797 --> 01:04:01.590
microscopes.
 

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:04.820
You want to see a piece of
bacteria, just pull the sucker

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.380
really close to your eye.
 

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.420
Why doesn't it work?
 

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:11.099
Because what we really see with
the eye is the following:

01:04:11.099 --> 01:04:14.347
if this is your eye,
what the eye cares about is the

01:04:14.347 --> 01:04:18.230
angle subtended by the object
with respect to your eye.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:19.980
We all know that.
 

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:22.929
So if you have the little
bacteria guy here,

01:04:22.929 --> 01:04:27.250
you can see it just as well if
you can bring it that closely.

01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:30.215
That will look as big as a
pencil 1 meter away,

01:04:30.215 --> 01:04:32.860
except the eye cannot
accommodate that.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:35.594
That's why you need a
magnifying lens,

01:04:35.594 --> 01:04:39.068
and that's the last thing I'm
going to tell you,

01:04:39.068 --> 01:04:42.320
is the principle of the
magnifying lens.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.701
So here is the deal:
the eye really cares about the

01:04:46.701 --> 01:04:51.784
angle subtended by some object,
but there is a limit to how

01:04:51.784 --> 01:04:54.150
close you can bring it.
 

01:04:54.150 --> 01:05:01.050
So if you have an object of
height h--you don't have

01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:02.360
any lens.
 

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:05.530
You just have your eye and
you're looking at it--

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:10.974
then if that's the height
h and that's the angle

01:05:10.974 --> 01:05:14.235
θ,
the best you can do,

01:05:14.235 --> 01:05:16.885
put θ_0,
is

01:05:16.885 --> 01:05:23.804
tanθ_0 =
h over this 25

01:05:23.804 --> 01:05:25.800
centimeters.
 

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.411
If you can come to 15
centimeters,

01:05:27.411 --> 01:05:29.661
θ_0 will
be even bigger,

01:05:29.661 --> 01:05:30.590
but you cannot.
 

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:32.795
So for an object of given
height h,

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:34.409
the smallest distance is 25.
 

01:05:34.409 --> 01:05:37.550
The biggest angle is
tanθ = h/25.

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:40.699
And for small angles,
we forget the tan and we say

01:05:40.699 --> 01:05:43.530
θ_0 is
h/25.

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:48.190
That's the best you can do
without a magnifier.

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:50.219
So what does a magnifier do?
 

01:05:50.219 --> 01:05:54.139
A magnifier,
this is the focal length here.

01:05:54.139 --> 01:05:57.960
You put the object here,
somewhere there,

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.320
and you try to form the image
for that one,

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.978
so the parallel ray goes
through the focal point on the

01:06:05.978 --> 01:06:07.099
other side.
 

01:06:07.099 --> 01:06:10.463
Then, let's see,
a parallel ray going to the

01:06:10.463 --> 01:06:13.983
focal point here,
that's where you're going to

01:06:13.983 --> 01:06:16.800
have to get a virtual image now.
 

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.309
Understand?
 

01:06:17.309 --> 01:06:20.244
Another ray you can draw is one
through the center that goes

01:06:20.244 --> 01:06:21.190
straight through.
 

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:25.909
If you continue these guys
here, you will find there's an

01:06:25.909 --> 01:06:28.440
image here, a virtual image.
 

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.773
In other words,
again what I'm telling you is

01:06:30.773 --> 01:06:34.112
the rays will not actually meet,
but they will seem to be coming

01:06:34.112 --> 01:06:35.280
from a point here.
 

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.490
So if this is
h_2 and this is

01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:41.773
v, the θ you
are getting is

01:06:41.773 --> 01:06:45.199
h_2/v,
which is h/u.

01:06:45.199 --> 01:06:50.079
This is your actual height and
this is u.

01:06:50.079 --> 01:06:53.244
So basically what you've done
is the following:

01:06:53.244 --> 01:06:57.577
you managed to bring the object
closer to your eye than the near

01:06:57.577 --> 01:06:59.159
point, if you want.
 

01:06:59.159 --> 01:07:04.039
That's because the actual image
seems to be much further where

01:07:04.039 --> 01:07:05.400
you can see it.
 

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.847
So the magnification,
the angle of opening you get

01:07:08.847 --> 01:07:14.534
with the magnifier is this,
so the magnification for angle

01:07:14.534 --> 01:07:20.728
is θ over
θ_0 and

01:07:20.728 --> 01:07:26.090
that equals h over u divided by
h over 25.

01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:31.989
That's 25 times 1/u.
 

01:07:31.989 --> 01:07:35.400
25 is in centimeters.
 

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:45.208
That we're going to write as
1/f −

01:07:45.208 --> 01:07:47.980
1/v.
 

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.380
Now you've got to be careful
here.

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:52.757
v is a negative number
because you're forming a virtual

01:07:52.757 --> 01:07:53.199
image.
 

01:07:53.199 --> 01:08:01.789
So I'm going to rewrite this as
the absolute value of v.

01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:07.240
Therefore the gain you get from
using the microscope can be

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:12.597
written as 25 over f  25
over the absolute value of

01:08:12.597 --> 01:08:13.820
v.
 

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.578
v is where the image is.
 

01:08:16.578 --> 01:08:19.170
Now where do you want this
image to be?

01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:22.630
Of course, the smaller the
v, better your

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:25.796
magnification is,
but v cannot be any

01:08:25.796 --> 01:08:27.270
smaller than 25.
 

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:30.368
The best you can do with
v is 25,

01:08:30.368 --> 01:08:34.498
in which case you will get 1 25
over f as your

01:08:34.498 --> 01:08:35.930
magnification.
 

01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:38.984
But if you're a jeweler working
with jewels all the time and you

01:08:38.984 --> 01:08:40.779
want to see your piece of
diamond,

01:08:40.779 --> 01:08:44.149
you don't want the image to be
at the near point of your eye,

01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:46.130
because you're really
struggling to see it,

01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:48.130
because that's the best your
eye can accommodate.

01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:50.590
It's okay for a few seconds,
but it hurts.

01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:55.020
Ideally you want to see the
object at infinity.

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:57.627
Therefore typically,
you pick v to be

01:08:57.627 --> 01:09:01.447
infinity that means you put the
thing you're looking at right at

01:09:01.447 --> 01:09:02.658
the focal point.
 

01:09:02.658 --> 01:09:05.811
If you put it at the focal
point, image will go to

01:09:05.811 --> 01:09:06.520
infinity.
 

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.676
Now you might say,
"Look, I've never seen an

01:09:08.676 --> 01:09:09.618
object at infinity.
 

01:09:09.618 --> 01:09:11.920
What are you talking
about?"

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.673
It turns out that infinity
could be 100 meters,

01:09:14.673 --> 01:09:17.130
or 10 meters is good enough for
a lens.

01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:19.380
It's far enough so that it
looks to be infinite.

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:21.279
How can you see something at
infinity?

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:23.417
The answer is,
as it goes farther out,

01:09:23.417 --> 01:09:26.248
it also gets taller,
so you don't lose anything by

01:09:26.248 --> 01:09:28.618
moving it farther out,
as long as it grows

01:09:28.618 --> 01:09:29.890
proportionately.
 

01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:33.595
It is just that distant objects
are when the eye muscles have to

01:09:33.595 --> 01:09:34.359
do no work.
 

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:37.235
In other words,
the human eye is designed to

01:09:37.235 --> 01:09:39.310
focus on objects at infinity.
 

01:09:39.310 --> 01:09:42.560
It can manage if you bring it
closer by those muscles working,

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.957
but if you don't want the
muscles to be tired,

01:09:44.957 --> 01:09:47.250
you want to have the image at
infinity.

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:49.710
So you take this little thing
you're looking at,

01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:52.840
and you use the lens to create
an image at infinity,

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.118
and again, forgetting the extra
1, most people don't bother with

01:09:57.118 --> 01:09:58.069
the extra 1.
 

01:09:58.069 --> 01:10:03.046
So the point to remember is the
angle of magnification is really

01:10:03.046 --> 01:10:07.627
given by 25 centimeters divided
by the focal length of your

01:10:07.627 --> 01:10:08.340
lens.
 

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:12.395
So if you have a lens,
a focal length 2.5 centimeters,

01:10:12.395 --> 01:10:15.609
you get an angle or
magnification of 10.

01:10:15.609 --> 01:10:18.206
Most of the time,
the magnification you get is 3

01:10:18.206 --> 01:10:18.868
or 4 or 5.
 

01:10:18.868 --> 01:10:23.197
Any of these things you buy in
a supermarket to read

01:10:23.197 --> 01:10:25.587
something--
you don't know what I'm talking

01:10:25.587 --> 01:10:27.747
about,
but you will in a few

01:10:27.747 --> 01:10:32.618
years--then that will give you
magnification of 3 or 4.

01:10:32.618 --> 01:10:35.318
All right, so this is the end
of geometrical optics,

01:10:35.318 --> 01:10:38.545
and next time I'm going to tell
you why you want to change the

01:10:38.545 --> 01:10:39.710
rules of the game.
 

01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:43.288
But before you go,
I won't let you go until you

01:10:43.288 --> 01:10:46.869
tell me why I would want to
change anything?

01:10:46.869 --> 01:10:50.488
Why would anybody change this?
 

01:10:50.488 --> 01:10:52.448
The minute you answer me,
you go to lunch.

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:55.680
What's the reason I would
change all this?

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:56.279
Yes?
 

01:10:56.279 --> 01:10:57.289
Student: 
&gt;

01:10:57.289 --> 01:10:59.840
Prof: Yes, he saved you.
 

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.538
There are some experiments that
contradict this.

01:11:02.538 --> 01:11:04.305
That's the only reason to
change anything,

01:11:04.305 --> 01:11:06.199
and I'll tell you what they are
next time.

01:11:06.199 --> 01:11:11.000

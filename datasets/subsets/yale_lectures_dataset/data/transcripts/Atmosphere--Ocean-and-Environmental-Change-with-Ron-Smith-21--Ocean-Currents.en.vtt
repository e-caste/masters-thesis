00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.833
RONALD SMITH: The announcements are

00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:07.533
there's a problem set due
today, and

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:11.800
you'll be starting a
new lab next week.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.700
Be sure to bring your laptop to
lab on Monday and Tuesday.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.800
This is a mostly a
computer-based data analysis

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.133
type lab, and you're going to
need your laptop from the very

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.100
beginning of that exercise.

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:33.900
Any questions before we start?

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.700
I'm going to go over the
exam first thing here.

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:46.700
Ok, so problem one, I
show you a top view

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.367
of a Focault pendulum.

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:54.733
So imagine you're looking
down at this thing.

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:59.233
And the bob is swinging back
and forth on this line.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:02.900
So just kind of looking
down like this.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.533
I asked you to sketch the forces
on the bob and explain

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.600
how the track will rotate if
the pendulum is in the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.600
Southern Hemisphere.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.533
So in the Southern Hemisphere,
Coriolis force acts to the

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.000
left of the motion vector.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.267
So when that bob is moving
upwards on this blackboard,

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:28.333
the Coriolis force is going
to be in that direction.

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:32.200
And when it's moving in the
other direction, the Coriolis

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.067
force is going to
be like that.

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:38.833
So the Coriolis force shifts
depending on the direction the

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:39.533
bob is moving.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.467
So what is that going to
do to the plane in

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:43.967
which the bob is swinging?

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:47.133
Well this part when it's
swinging that way it's going

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:51.633
to deflect it a little
bit like that.

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:54.333
And then when it's swinging back
and this force acts on

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:58.500
it, it's going to deflect it
a little bit like that.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.700
And then that's going to repeat
that way and then that

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.967
way and then that way.

00:02:02.967 --> 00:02:08.867
So basically the plane in which
the bob is rotating is

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:16.567
going to rotate in the
counterclockwise direction.

00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:19.900
So if you came back several
hours later and it started out

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.367
here, now it's going to be
oscillating like that.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:27.167
And, of course, if we were in
the Northern Hemisphere, it

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:28.700
would be the opposite.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.000
It would rotate in the
clockwise direction.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.800
Questions on that?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.233
Yes.

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:40.433
STUDENT: What does CCW mean?

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:41.700
PROFESSOR: Counterclockwise.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.633
Is that something the
TA put on there?

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:50.333
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:50.633
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:53.900
STUDENT: I said it
was to the left.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.367
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:58.433
See left is a little bit
ambiguous because what does

00:02:58.433 --> 00:02:59.467
left mean here?

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:01.600
I don't know.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.800
OK, question two.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.000
Explain how cool winds and a
gust wind are created by a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.567
thunderstorm.

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:14.533
So the basic idea there is you
get rain coming out of the

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:16.367
base of the cloud.

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:18.700
You know that below the cloud,
the relative humidity

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.100
is less than 100%.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.833
So as soon as that rain falls
below cloud base, it's going

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:28.233
to begin to evaporate.

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:31.567
Now maybe only a small fraction
will evaporate, maybe

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:32.600
all of it will evaporate.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.833
I remember when I used to live
in Colorado, you'd see--in the

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:40.700
summertime you'd see
thunderstorms, deep convective

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.400
storms, with the rain coming out
of the base, and it would

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.267
all evaporate.

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:47.633
None of it reached the
surface of the Earth.

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:50.600
When you see that, by the way,
when it doesn't reach the

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.800
surface here, it's
called virga.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.433
But in any case, whether it all
evaporates or just some of

00:03:56.433 --> 00:04:02.867
it, it takes heat to evaporate
water, and so--and that heat

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:03.933
comes out of the air.

00:04:03.933 --> 00:04:07.433
So there's a cooling that takes
place, an evaporative

00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:12.967
cooling that takes place just
below the cloud base, and that

00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:18.133
takes air and makes it cooler
and more dense.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:22.700
So it then falls out of the sky
until it hits the surface,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.367
and then spreads out.

00:04:25.367 --> 00:04:28.600
And the front of that is
called the gust front.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.033
So the basic idea here is that
evaporation of raindrops below

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:39.867
the cloud base cools the air,
makes it sink and spread out.

00:04:39.867 --> 00:04:43.367
So that's the idea behind if
you've experienced this in the

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:46.167
summertime, you hear a
thunderstorm in the distance,

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:49.667
and then for a few minutes
later the wind

00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:51.667
begins to pick up.

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:54.533
It'll be a cool wind, typically,
and blowing from

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:56.567
the direction of the
thunderstorm.

00:04:56.567 --> 00:04:57.267
That's this.

00:04:57.267 --> 00:04:59.700
That's that cool air
coming down from

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.067
the base of the cloud.

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:03.300
Questions on that?

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.733
Question three.

00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:10.867
I give you 45 degrees north.

00:05:10.867 --> 00:05:15.367
There's a pressure gradient,
0.002 Pascals per meter, with

00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:18.667
pressure increasing towards the
west. So on a map view,

00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:24.267
north, south, east, west, the
question states that the

00:05:24.267 --> 00:05:27.167
pressure is greater towards
the west because it's high

00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:30.700
pressure over here relative to
low pressure over there.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.367
The lines of constant pressure,
if you drew them in,

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:41.367
the isobars would be oriented
north-south like that.

00:05:41.367 --> 00:05:45.033
An air parcel sitting in there
is going to feel a pressure

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:47.633
gradient acting from
high to low.

00:05:47.633 --> 00:05:51.533
So that's the pressure
gradient force.

00:05:51.533 --> 00:05:54.833
And if we can assume that the
air is in geostrophic balance,

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:59.900
the Coriolis force must be equal
and opposite to that.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.767
We're in the Northern
Hemisphere, 45

00:06:02.767 --> 00:06:05.233
degrees north latitude.

00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:08.467
So if the Coriolis force is like
that, the wind must be

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:13.033
such that the Coriolis force
is at right angles to the

00:06:13.033 --> 00:06:16.200
wind, and to the right
of the wind.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.933
So there's only one possible
solution for the wind, and

00:06:19.933 --> 00:06:22.433
that would be that vector.

00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:24.667
So that the Coriolis
force is to the

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:28.833
right of the wind motion.

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:32.800
So, well I'm getting ahead of
the story, this is part B. But

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.900
basically, the velocity
direction would

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.000
be towards the south.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.800
You could state that as a
northerly wind if you wanted,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.233
but the direction will
be towards the south.

00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:48.133
Now, the magnitude of the
geostrophic wind is given by

00:06:48.133 --> 00:06:52.467
the pressure gradient
divided by 2 rho

00:06:52.467 --> 00:06:55.300
omega sine of the latitude.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.867
So let's put in some
numbers on that.

00:06:56.867 --> 00:07:03.300
It's 0.002, 2 the density of air
at sea level is about 1.2

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.133
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:09.100
The rotation rate of the
Earth is 7.27 times 10

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.867
to the minus 7.

00:07:10.867 --> 00:07:16.767
And the sine of 45 degrees
is about 0.71.

00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:20.900
So that turns out to be 16.2
meters per second.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.300
I would recommend you notice
I left off the units, but I

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.933
don't recommend that.

00:07:25.933 --> 00:07:29.333
If you put the units for
everything, Pascals per meter,

00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:33.633
kilograms per cubic meter,
seconds to the minus 1, you

00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:36.367
can work it out and you
should get units of

00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:39.200
speed meters per second.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.133
And if you don't, maybe you've
left out something.

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:45.067
Maybe you've got the units wrong
or you've left out a

00:07:45.067 --> 00:07:46.467
factor or something like that.

00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:50.400
So it's always good to check
the units on that.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:56.467
For part C, again, what you've
assumed is geostrophic

00:07:56.467 --> 00:08:00.067
balance, which says that the
Coriolis force and the

00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:04.367
pressure gradient force are
equal and opposite.

00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:07.633
That is the definition of
geostrophic balance.

00:08:07.633 --> 00:08:08.133
Yeah.

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:08.533
STUDENT: Is the rotation rate
10 to the minus 7 or 10

00:08:08.533 --> 00:08:09.800
to the minus 5?

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.867
PROFESSOR: 10 to the
negative sorry, this is wrong.

00:08:13.867 --> 00:08:15.667
10 to the minus 5.

00:08:15.667 --> 00:08:16.933
Thank you.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.200
If you ever I mean I gave you
that constant on the equation

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.800
sheet, but if you ever need it
and can't remember it, just

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.033
take 2 pi, which is the number
of radians in a circle, and

00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:41.433
divided it by the length of a
day expressed in seconds.

00:08:41.433 --> 00:08:46.500
And you'll get that number, 7.27
times 10 to the so it's

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.833
just the rotation rate of the
Earth basically, expressed in

00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:51.067
radians per second.

00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:55.933
Four.

00:08:55.933 --> 00:08:59.967
Explain why the sky appears
blue, but a cloud appears

00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:03.033
white under similar illumination
from the Sun.

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:05.033
So the idea is we have
our observer.

00:09:07.733 --> 00:09:09.133
We have a cloud here.

00:09:09.133 --> 00:09:16.300
And the Sun is illuminating the
cloud, but is also seeing

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.533
radiation that's been scattered
I don't have to draw

00:09:19.533 --> 00:09:20.767
another beam there.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.400
Some light is scattered out of
this beam coming directly to

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.700
the observer, and that's
blue light.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.500
But this is white light.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.100
So the difference has to do with
the size of the particles

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.367
that are doing the scattering.

00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:48.800
In the case of the sky, the
particles are molecules.

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:56.133
And the condition that the
wavelength is much, much

00:09:56.133 --> 00:10:00.600
greater than the diameter of the
particle is met, and that

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.233
puts us into the Rayleigh
scattering regime.

00:10:06.133 --> 00:10:09.267
In that case, short wavelengths
are scattered much

00:10:09.267 --> 00:10:12.933
more strongly than longer
wavelengths.

00:10:12.933 --> 00:10:15.567
Remember, the part of the
spectrum we can see with our

00:10:15.567 --> 00:10:20.333
eye, the visible part
of the spectrum has

00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:23.200
red, green and blue.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.100
Blue being the shorter.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.833
Red being the longer
wavelength.

00:10:26.833 --> 00:10:29.800
So in Rayleigh scattering where
short wavelengths are

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.700
scattered more strongly, that'll
be the blue light

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.600
that's scattered more than
the green and the red.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.800
So this light scattered out of
the Sun's beam to your eye by

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.900
molecules is going to be
dominated by the blue light.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.567
For the cloud itself, the
particles are much larger.

00:10:47.567 --> 00:10:48.833
They're the cloud droplets.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.267
They fall into the category
that the wavelength is the

00:10:58.267 --> 00:11:05.200
same order of magnitude
as the cloud droplet.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.700
Which puts us into the Mie
scattering range where all

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.067
wavelengths are scattered
equally.

00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:14.667
So whatever color was
illuminating this, you'd have

00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:16.067
the same color coming out.

00:11:16.067 --> 00:11:19.733
So if it's white light
illuminating the cloud, and

00:11:19.733 --> 00:11:24.300
the Sun's radiation is usually
composed of roughly equal

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.500
mixtures of blue, green and
red, so that would appear

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.533
white to our eye.

00:11:28.533 --> 00:11:30.333
Then the light scattered
by the cloud is

00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:33.533
also going to be white.

00:11:33.533 --> 00:11:38.400
By the way, if you have a
setting Sun illuminating the

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.767
cloud where some of the blue
light has already been

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:45.400
scattered out, it may
be that the cloud is

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.367
illuminated by red light.

00:11:48.367 --> 00:11:52.233
In that case, the cloud would
appear red as well.

00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:54.700
But the point here is that
under Mie scattering, it

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.067
scatters equally whatever is
illuminating the cloud.

00:11:58.067 --> 00:12:02.367
So it'll keep the color the same
as it scatters radiation

00:12:02.367 --> 00:12:05.367
from the cloud.

00:12:05.367 --> 00:12:07.867
Questions there?

00:12:07.867 --> 00:12:08.567
Question five.

00:12:08.567 --> 00:12:13.467
Why are hurricanes not found
over the sea near the equator?

00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:16.400
Well right near the equator
within four or five degrees of

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.067
the equator, there's not
sufficient Coriolis force.

00:12:20.067 --> 00:12:24.133
In order to form a hurricane, as
the air moves in and begins

00:12:24.133 --> 00:12:27.067
to lift upwards, there's got to
be a Coriolis force to give

00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:29.667
it a sense of spin.

00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:32.533
And if you don't have a
sufficient Coriolis force,

00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:37.967
then you can't really
form a hurricane.

00:12:37.967 --> 00:12:40.733
Part B, in the tropical
south Atlantic.

00:12:40.733 --> 00:12:44.800
So let's assume you're south of
the Equator enough to have

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.733
a Coriolis force, but it turns
out in the Atlantic Ocean,

00:12:48.733 --> 00:12:53.267
there's a cold current that
comes up from the southern

00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:57.733
ocean that drops the ocean
temperature below that

00:12:57.733 --> 00:13:02.633
threshold value it's 27,
28 degrees Celsius, and

00:13:02.633 --> 00:13:04.167
therefore, you don't
have the ocean

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:08.233
warmth to create a hurricane.

00:13:10.967 --> 00:13:12.200
Questions there?

00:13:14.633 --> 00:13:17.767
Question six I thought
was straightforward.

00:13:17.767 --> 00:13:22.433
Basically is why water drops
form on the outside of a cool

00:13:22.433 --> 00:13:23.700
glass of water?

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:30.933
So you've got cold water or cool
water in there at some

00:13:30.933 --> 00:13:32.333
temperature.

00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:36.633
And you want to know when beads
of water would form on

00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:37.100
the outside.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.333
Well, of course the water is
not coming from inside the

00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:42.567
glass through the glass, that
water is coming from the

00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:44.067
atmosphere around.

00:13:44.067 --> 00:13:47.700
The only role of the water in
the glass is to control the

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.100
temperature of the outer
surface of the glass.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.733
And the key condition is that
the temperature of that glass,

00:13:56.733 --> 00:14:03.000
if it's less than the dew point
of the atmosphere around

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.533
it, then you will get
condensation.

00:14:07.533 --> 00:14:11.933
The idea is that the glass will
remove heat from the air

00:14:11.933 --> 00:14:15.967
adjacent to it, drop the
saturation vapor pressure

00:14:15.967 --> 00:14:22.467
down, and if it can drop it low
enough, it can drop the

00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:27.600
temperature down below the dew
point, then you'll bring water

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.333
out of the vapor state and
condense it on the

00:14:30.333 --> 00:14:31.567
outside of the glass.

00:14:31.567 --> 00:14:35.000
So I was looking for a clear
explanation of that.

00:14:39.933 --> 00:14:42.200
Question seven.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.667
How do the raindrops form that
we find falling from a tall

00:14:46.667 --> 00:14:47.900
cumulonimbus cloud?

00:14:54.133 --> 00:14:59.733
In the summertime you get tall
cumulus clouds with heavy rain

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:01.833
out the bottom.

00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:04.733
The fact that they're tall means
that the top part of it

00:15:04.733 --> 00:15:09.833
is certainly going to be at a
temperature lower than zero

00:15:09.833 --> 00:15:10.900
degrees Celsius.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.533
So there's going to be super
cooled water up here.

00:15:19.733 --> 00:15:23.300
And that's going to be the key
for generating precipitation.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.467
So using the ice phase mechanism
then you can convert

00:15:27.467 --> 00:15:29.500
these to snowflakes.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.800
They'll fall, when they fall
below the zero degree line,

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.500
they'll melt and form raindrops
and then they'll

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.233
fall to Earth.

00:15:37.233 --> 00:15:40.267
So what you had to say there
was to mention, at least

00:15:40.267 --> 00:15:44.067
mention, the ice phase mechanism
because that's how

00:15:44.067 --> 00:15:46.533
the hydrometer would
be formed.

00:15:46.533 --> 00:15:50.133
And then you had to describe how
it would melt on the way

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:52.967
down to form a raindrop.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.100
Question 8.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:11.133
I imagine on the Earth some air
moving northward with a

00:16:11.133 --> 00:16:15.067
temperature of 20 degrees C, and
some air moving southward

00:16:15.067 --> 00:16:19.533
with a degree of--with a
temperature of 10 degrees C.

00:16:19.533 --> 00:16:23.067
And I asked you to compute
how much heat is

00:16:23.067 --> 00:16:25.200
being transported northward.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:32.100
The idea there is that the heat
transported is given by

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.833
the rate I'll put a dot over it
to indicate it's a rate the

00:16:34.833 --> 00:16:37.533
rate at which you're moving mass
forward times and heat

00:16:37.533 --> 00:16:44.367
capacity of the air times well,
if it's a two stream

00:16:44.367 --> 00:16:47.067
difference and you want to
compute the net amount of

00:16:47.067 --> 00:16:48.833
heat, then you'd use the
temperature differences

00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:50.400
between the two streams.
That's the

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.400
way I did the problem.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:59.333
So my answer for this was 10 to
the eleventh kilograms per

00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:05.600
second for the mass flow rate,
and that was given.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.500
The heat capacity of air is
1,004, and that has units of

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:15.600
Joules per kilogram
per degree Kelvin.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.267
And then the temperature
difference between the two

00:17:17.267 --> 00:17:21.100
streams, the delta-T
was 10 degrees.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.100
And look how the units are
going to work there.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.167
This is going to be in Kelvin
or Celsius, in either case

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:27.733
it'll cancel.

00:17:27.733 --> 00:17:32.467
The kilograms will cancel, and
you get something with Joules

00:17:32.467 --> 00:17:35.900
per second, which is
a watt, by the way.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:44.867
So I ended up with what did
I get 1.5 times 10 to the

00:17:44.867 --> 00:17:49.867
seventeenth oh sorry.

00:17:49.867 --> 00:18:07.300
Let's see, about 1.004 times
10 to the fifteenth watts,

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:13.600
which could be expressed as
about 1.004 petawatts.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.767
Peta meaning the shortcut
for 10 to the fifteenth.

00:18:15.767 --> 00:18:19.100
So it's approximately 1 times
10 to the fifteenth watts.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.567
Now, there was some confusion
because while I described

00:18:23.567 --> 00:18:27.167
these two air masses moving
northward and southward, in

00:18:27.167 --> 00:18:31.367
the end I said how much heat
is transported northward.

00:18:31.367 --> 00:18:33.900
What I meant to say, what I
hoped you would interpret that

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.967
is the net amount transported
northwards.

00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:39.667
And that's what I've
computed here.

00:18:39.667 --> 00:18:42.800
It may be, though, that some
of you computed just the

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.833
amount of heat transported
northward by the northward

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:48.533
moving current.

00:18:48.533 --> 00:18:50.567
Maybe that could be supported
given by the

00:18:50.567 --> 00:18:51.433
way I wrote the question.

00:18:51.433 --> 00:18:55.333
But what I intended was the net
heat given the fact that

00:18:55.333 --> 00:19:00.967
there's both a northward and a
southward block of air moving.

00:19:00.967 --> 00:19:06.433
So look at the grading and see
what the TAs did about that.

00:19:06.433 --> 00:19:07.667
Questions there?

00:19:12.733 --> 00:19:15.600
We're getting close
to the end here.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.933
Question nine says that on a
rainy day a centimeter of rain

00:19:21.933 --> 00:19:27.767
falls on a 10,000 square
kilometer area.

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:29.200
Estimate the total
latent heat.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:35.267
So you imagine some big cloud
system raining out, putting a

00:19:35.267 --> 00:19:38.967
layer of water on the surface
of the Earth.

00:19:38.967 --> 00:19:43.200
You just have to compute the
volume of that layer.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.800
Then from the volume multiplied
by the density of

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.333
fresh water to get the
mass of that layer.

00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:53.600
And then knowing the latent heat
of condensation, you know

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.833
how much heat had to be released
in order to condense

00:19:57.833 --> 00:20:01.267
that much vapor to a liquid.

00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:04.267
So from the mass you just
multiply that by the latent

00:20:04.267 --> 00:20:07.533
heat of condensation.

00:20:07.533 --> 00:20:12.067
So the dimensions of this give
the volume, the mass--the

00:20:12.067 --> 00:20:15.633
density of water, which is
1,000 kilograms per cubic

00:20:15.633 --> 00:20:17.233
meter gives you the mass.

00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:19.300
And then the latent heat of
condensation gives you the

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:24.967
rest. And the answer is about
1.5 times 10 to the

00:20:24.967 --> 00:20:26.733
seventeenth joules.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.733
STUDENT: 2.5.

00:20:32.733 --> 00:20:33.800
PROFESSOR: Sorry, 2.5.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.600
Thank you.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.667
That 2.5 comes from
the latent heat.

00:20:37.667 --> 00:20:38.900
Thank you.

00:20:41.567 --> 00:20:44.867
The last problem then was to
explain the reason for the

00:20:44.867 --> 00:20:47.567
rainy season in these
two cities.

00:20:55.667 --> 00:20:59.433
Jerusalem lies here.

00:20:59.433 --> 00:21:05.467
And Asuncion, Paraguay, except
it shifted in longitude occurs

00:21:05.467 --> 00:21:06.733
somewhere here.

00:21:09.333 --> 00:21:13.333
Now, Jerusalem has a--it's in
the Northern Hemisphere.

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:16.367
Wettest month is January, and
notice from the temperatures,

00:21:16.367 --> 00:21:18.867
that's also the cooler month.

00:21:18.867 --> 00:21:24.067
So Jerusalem gets a wintertime
rainy season, and that is

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:28.533
clearly due to the southward
shift of the polar front.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.567
So what's happened is that
during the winter season, this

00:21:36.567 --> 00:21:39.100
polar front has moved southward
and is giving you

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.667
frontal cyclones that come
through that latitude and give

00:21:42.667 --> 00:21:44.067
you the rain.

00:21:44.067 --> 00:21:48.133
In Asuncion, Paraguay, Southern
Hemisphere, the

00:21:48.133 --> 00:21:50.800
wettest month is December.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.600
In the Southern Hemisphere
that's summertime.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.200
Notice also from the temperature
that that's the

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.833
warmer month.

00:21:57.833 --> 00:22:01.000
So you know immediately
that is a summertime

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.867
precipitation maximum.

00:22:02.867 --> 00:22:07.367
And that guarantees that it's
going to be a southward shift

00:22:07.367 --> 00:22:12.800
of the ITCZ, giving you
precipitation there.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.200
So the ITCZ in the Southern
Hemisphere summer moves across

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.300
the Equator into the Southern
Hemisphere and brings

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.800
precipitation to Asuncion.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.000
So that's going to be convective
rain, not frontal

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.833
rain, and it's going to be
in the summer wet season.

00:22:32.833 --> 00:22:34.067
Any questions on that?

00:22:36.867 --> 00:22:39.500
The average grade on that
exam was a bit lower

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.867
than the first one.

00:22:40.867 --> 00:22:43.500
It was 74%.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:48.167
And if you've got maybe 10
degrees--10 degrees--10 points

00:22:48.167 --> 00:22:51.033
lower than that, maybe drop me
a note, come see me, we'll

00:22:51.033 --> 00:22:53.567
talk about how to improve
things in the future.

00:22:53.567 --> 00:22:56.367
But for some reason, the grades
were a little bit lower

00:22:56.367 --> 00:22:57.867
on this than the other one.

00:22:57.867 --> 00:23:02.100
And take that into account when
you're don't be overly

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.433
critical of yourself, because
apparently your classmates

00:23:05.433 --> 00:23:07.400
found that to be a tough
exam as well.

00:23:23.867 --> 00:23:28.100
We're going to continue
where we left off.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:28.967
Question, yes?

00:23:28.967 --> 00:23:29.800
STUDENT: I was wondering what
the average score corresponds

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.033
to in grade?

00:23:35.167 --> 00:23:36.800
PROFESSOR: I don't do
that calculation until the

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.567
end of the course.

00:23:37.567 --> 00:23:40.000
I keep them just as numerical
scores until

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.100
the end of the course.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.267
You can judge that for yourself,
perhaps, based on

00:23:43.267 --> 00:23:44.400
the average grade.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.867
But that's not a calculation
that I do until I get all the

00:23:47.867 --> 00:23:49.100
scores at the end.

00:23:54.567 --> 00:23:57.733
So we're talking about
atmospheric forcing of the

00:23:57.733 --> 00:24:01.067
ocean, and I showed this
slide last time.

00:24:01.067 --> 00:24:02.467
I'll just go back over it.

00:24:02.467 --> 00:24:06.533
Basically the ocean is driven by
the atmosphere above it in

00:24:06.533 --> 00:24:08.800
these three ways.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.933
Heat added, and taken away,
fresh water added and taken

00:24:12.933 --> 00:24:14.500
away, and the wind stress.

00:24:18.667 --> 00:24:26.567
We can quantify this, and recent
investigators have

00:24:26.567 --> 00:24:31.500
tried to do this by producing
maps, in this case, of the

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:38.467
heat flux in and out of the
ocean, or the water flux in or

00:24:38.467 --> 00:24:44.167
out of the ocean, or the
wind stress applied

00:24:44.167 --> 00:24:45.233
to the ocean surface.

00:24:45.233 --> 00:24:49.033
So we know a bit about
this forcing.

00:24:49.033 --> 00:24:54.333
And last time I derived some
formulas for this, how a layer

00:24:54.333 --> 00:24:58.300
of depth D, which will feel
the direct effect of this

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.900
forcing, would respond
to fresh water,

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.300
heat, or wind stress.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.967
I won't go back over those
derivations, but for the wind

00:25:07.967 --> 00:25:11.100
stress, which is I think the
most difficult of the three,

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.267
the concept involved
this Ekman layer.

00:25:13.267 --> 00:25:16.467
When the wind blows over the
ocean and puts a frictional

00:25:16.467 --> 00:25:20.767
stress on it, the first few tens
of meters or hundreds of

00:25:20.767 --> 00:25:25.067
meters responds to that
directly, but in an odd way.

00:25:25.067 --> 00:25:28.567
It moves off well, it has
a spiral with depth.

00:25:28.567 --> 00:25:29.667
I'm not going to talk
about that.

00:25:29.667 --> 00:25:34.333
But if you average that out, the
net of all that motion is

00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:36.467
directly to the right
of the wind stress.

00:25:39.333 --> 00:25:40.900
That's this big arrow here.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.000
That's the direction of Ekman
transport, exactly at right

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.200
angles to the wind stress
that's being applied.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.067
So if you had a wind, say,
from the southwest to the

00:25:54.067 --> 00:25:56.933
northeast, giving you wind
stress in that direction

00:25:56.933 --> 00:26:01.600
that's the black arrow and you
gave it a few hours to come

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.867
into this new state of balance
called the Ekman force

00:26:04.867 --> 00:26:08.700
balance, that force would be
balanced by the Coriolis

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.733
force, and if that's going to
be the Coriolis force, then

00:26:12.733 --> 00:26:14.767
the Ekman transport must
be in that direction.

00:26:14.767 --> 00:26:22.000
So the CF is at right angles
to the net Ekman transport.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.833
Now, this is not identical with
the geostrophic balance.

00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:29.100
Remember, geostrophic balance
was a balance between Coriolis

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.400
force and pressure
gradient force.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.767
I have no pressure gradient
force in this problem.

00:26:35.767 --> 00:26:40.133
This instead is a balance
between a frictional stress

00:26:40.133 --> 00:26:43.033
being applied to the ocean,
and the Coriolis force.

00:26:45.567 --> 00:26:46.733
But it's very real.

00:26:46.733 --> 00:26:50.333
I mean you can measure this
easily in the ocean.

00:26:50.333 --> 00:26:53.300
If the wind is blowing briskly
from one direction you can

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.367
measure the surface
water moving off

00:26:55.367 --> 00:26:56.700
in the right direction.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.333
I'll mention this
in a week or so.

00:26:58.333 --> 00:27:00.300
The same thing applies
to icebergs.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.433
When the wind blows on an
iceberg, it moves at right

00:27:04.433 --> 00:27:07.167
angles to that force.

00:27:07.167 --> 00:27:08.933
The old sea captains
would make notes of

00:27:08.933 --> 00:27:10.033
that in their log.

00:27:10.033 --> 00:27:12.533
Winds are from the south today,
but the icebergs are

00:27:12.533 --> 00:27:14.600
moving off to the east.
What's going on there?

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:19.067
Well, you guys know, it has to
do with this kind of a balance

00:27:19.067 --> 00:27:20.200
including the Coriolis force.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.833
So again, not the same as
geostrophic balance, but they

00:27:23.833 --> 00:27:27.533
both involve the Coriolis force
in an important way.

00:27:30.067 --> 00:27:33.233
These are the formulas that
I derived last time.

00:27:33.233 --> 00:27:37.000
If you added an amount of heat
per unit area Q over A, you

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.633
can compute how the temperature
of some depth D

00:27:39.633 --> 00:27:42.200
will change.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.667
If you add a layer of fresh
water to the ocean of

00:27:46.667 --> 00:27:52.500
thickness little d, and then you
mix that in to some layer

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:56.667
of depth D, there's how the
salinity will change.

00:27:56.667 --> 00:28:00.733
If you put a wind stress tau
on the ocean, and that is

00:28:00.733 --> 00:28:04.667
mixed down to depth d, that's
what the speed will be of that

00:28:04.667 --> 00:28:06.967
Ekman flow that goes off
at right angles.

00:28:06.967 --> 00:28:07.900
Yeah.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:13.133
STUDENT: In the Ekman wind
stress, is the rho--

00:28:13.133 --> 00:28:14.600
in the denominator is that the
density of water or air?

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.467
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:28:15.467 --> 00:28:15.867
Correct.

00:28:15.867 --> 00:28:18.300
Water.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.833
I left off the subscript, but
that should be water.

00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:22.867
when you're computing tau,
however, I gave you

00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:24.433
a formula for tau.

00:28:24.433 --> 00:28:26.100
It was rho u squared.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.667
That was the density of air,
and the speed of the wind.

00:28:30.667 --> 00:28:33.733
So in the formula for tau that
I gave you, it's the density

00:28:33.733 --> 00:28:35.233
of air that appears there.

00:28:35.233 --> 00:28:37.633
But down to the bottom here it's
the density of sea water.

00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:39.100
STUDENT: So they don't
divide out?

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.267
PROFESSOR: No because
there a factor of a

00:28:40.267 --> 00:28:41.200
thousand different.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.900
STUDENT: OK.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.567
PROFESSOR: The density of air
at sea level is about 1.2

00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:47.633
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:28:47.633 --> 00:28:50.633
The density of sea water's
about 1,000 kilograms per

00:28:50.633 --> 00:28:51.500
cubic meter.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:51.733
Yeah.

00:28:51.733 --> 00:28:52.433
STUDENT: Just real quick again,
the little d versus big

00:28:52.433 --> 00:28:53.700
D, the big D is the
depth and--

00:28:57.167 --> 00:29:00.533
PROFESSOR: D--in all
cases, D is this layer that is

00:29:00.533 --> 00:29:02.733
feeling the direct influence
of these forcings.

00:29:05.933 --> 00:29:08.200
And it's hard to predict exactly
what that'll be.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.733
It'll depend on how much
turbulence there is, how deep

00:29:10.733 --> 00:29:12.767
things are going to get mixed.

00:29:12.767 --> 00:29:14.833
But it's something very
small compared to

00:29:14.833 --> 00:29:16.167
the total ocean depth.

00:29:16.167 --> 00:29:20.500
It may be only a few tens of
meters if the winds are weak,

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.767
and there's not much
turbulence.

00:29:21.767 --> 00:29:24.600
It could be 100 meters or 200
meters if the winds are very

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.033
strong and you're mixing the
ocean very vigorously.

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:31.833
So I can't give you a fixed
value for d, it'll depend on

00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:34.600
conditions.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.867
Good questions there.

00:29:38.733 --> 00:29:43.067
So if those are our three
forcings, then what do they do

00:29:43.067 --> 00:29:43.800
to the ocean?

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:49.733
Well the first two, the heat
and the fresh water input,

00:29:49.733 --> 00:29:55.700
will modify the temperature
and the salinity.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.633
The temperature and salinity
will in turn change the

00:29:58.633 --> 00:30:01.067
density of the seawater.

00:30:01.067 --> 00:30:06.967
And then gravity will act on
those density differences to

00:30:06.967 --> 00:30:11.200
produce currents down
in the ocean.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.733
And those currents are called
thermohaline currents.

00:30:15.733 --> 00:30:19.933
The name reminds you is they
have to do with heat and salt.

00:30:19.933 --> 00:30:23.233
But they're acting through the
role of heat and salt in

00:30:23.233 --> 00:30:26.000
controlling seawater density.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.767
Typically these currents
are slow and deep.

00:30:31.767 --> 00:30:34.267
As I will show you in the next
few minutes, they are

00:30:34.267 --> 00:30:38.133
responsible for the water mass
distributions in the ocean,

00:30:38.133 --> 00:30:41.367
for the conveyor belt
circulation, and for example,

00:30:41.367 --> 00:30:43.933
also for estuary circulation.

00:30:43.933 --> 00:30:47.100
So these are very important
circulations in the ocean,

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.900
even though they tend to be
rather slow in the speed of

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.933
their motions.

00:30:52.933 --> 00:30:54.700
These are the thermohaline
currents.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.400
So let's take a look at the
Atlantic Ocean along this

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.633
section of 25 west longitude.

00:31:03.633 --> 00:31:09.067
Here is a temperature section
given where this goes north to

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:14.533
south, sea level down
to 6,000 meters.

00:31:14.533 --> 00:31:17.600
And the black is the terrain.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.600
Now, the first thing that
strikes you about this image

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.900
perhaps is the steepness
of this terrain.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.000
Oh my goodness, are there really
these sharp spikes and

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.400
cliffs in the ocean?

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.833
And the answer is please
remember that when you make a

00:31:33.833 --> 00:31:37.900
diagram like this, there is a
lot of vertical exaggeration.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.767
For example, that distance is 5
kilometers or 6 kilometers,

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:46.633
whereas this distance is
something like 15,000

00:31:46.633 --> 00:31:47.967
kilometers.

00:31:47.967 --> 00:31:51.567
So there is really an enormous
vertical exaggeration.

00:31:51.567 --> 00:31:55.233
Where I could squish this down
or stretch this out, these

00:31:55.233 --> 00:31:59.867
supposedly steep slopes would
become very, very gradual.

00:31:59.867 --> 00:32:03.067
Probably only 1% or 2% slopes.

00:32:03.067 --> 00:32:05.600
So don't be fooled by this.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.600
It's only the vertical
exaggeration that gives you

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.767
that apparent steepness.

00:32:11.767 --> 00:32:15.267
Now, for the temperature itself,
you can't read the

00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:19.600
labels very well, but some of
these are slightly negative,

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:26.200
temperature of minus 0.02--sorry
0.2 or 0.4.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:31.700
If I've got a temperature of
minus 0.4 Celsius, is that

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.900
super cooled water?

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.867
Is that super cooled water?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.833
How many think yes?

00:32:40.833 --> 00:32:42.333
Show of hands.

00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:43.733
How many think no?

00:32:43.733 --> 00:32:46.267
The danger of putting no up,
I'm going to ask you why.

00:32:46.267 --> 00:32:49.500
Why don't you think that's
super cooled water?

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.167
STUDENT: Is it because
it has salt in it?

00:32:51.167 --> 00:32:51.867
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:32:51.867 --> 00:32:55.400
So it's not super cooled water
because the salt actually

00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.167
depresses the sea level
by a degree or two.

00:33:00.167 --> 00:33:03.267
So in fact, you can have a
temperature down to maybe

00:33:03.267 --> 00:33:08.333
minus 1 or 1 1/2 degrees
Celsius, and still be above

00:33:08.333 --> 00:33:12.600
the freezing point because the
salt has suppressed the

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.667
freezing point slightly.

00:33:13.667 --> 00:33:15.867
So this is not super
cooled water.

00:33:15.867 --> 00:33:19.733
It's not about to freeze if you
introduce some kind of a

00:33:19.733 --> 00:33:22.800
freezing nucleus to
it or something.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.900
I want you to notice this band
of blue coming down here.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.967
We're going to identify that
as Antarctic Bottom Water.

00:33:29.967 --> 00:33:34.233
It's very cold water that's
formed where the ice sheets

00:33:34.233 --> 00:33:38.267
from Antarctica float out
over the ocean and

00:33:38.267 --> 00:33:40.400
cool the ocean down.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.100
And that water becomes so cold
and so dense that it falls to

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.700
the bottom of the ocean and
then spreads northward.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.967
In this diagram it reaches
the Equator.

00:33:50.967 --> 00:33:52.800
Depending--in some other
sections, it actually gets a

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.900
little bit north
of the Equator.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.667
This is amazing.

00:33:55.667 --> 00:34:00.600
So a water mass formed under the
ice shelves of Antarctica

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.967
falls to the bottom of the
ocean, and then under its own

00:34:02.967 --> 00:34:09.233
weight slowly moves, sinking
and spreading, actually in

00:34:09.233 --> 00:34:11.833
some cases getting north
of the Equator.

00:34:11.833 --> 00:34:15.900
That's Antarctic Bottom
Water, AABW.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.267
One of the important water
masses in the Atlantic Ocean

00:34:19.267 --> 00:34:20.500
is the AABW.

00:34:23.967 --> 00:34:28.400
There is a layer of warm water
floating right on the top in

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.100
the tropical and equatorial
regions.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.333
And there are some other water
masses up in here that will be

00:34:35.333 --> 00:34:38.267
a little bit easier to identify
when we look at the

00:34:38.267 --> 00:34:39.867
salinity field.

00:34:39.867 --> 00:34:42.267
So let me look at the
salinity field here.

00:34:42.267 --> 00:34:53.800
Atlantic salinity, and 34.7,
34.9, and so on.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.000
The Antarctic Bottom Water you
can maybe see it there, but

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.267
it's not as easily seen in
the temperature field.

00:35:00.267 --> 00:35:03.533
But look at this thing.

00:35:03.533 --> 00:35:04.733
There's a tongue.

00:35:04.733 --> 00:35:08.367
Apparently, a water mass is
being formed here in the

00:35:08.367 --> 00:35:15.267
Antarctic Ocean so sorry,
in the Southern Ocean.

00:35:15.267 --> 00:35:17.267
Not close to the shores of
Antarctica, but in the

00:35:17.267 --> 00:35:18.067
southern Ocean.

00:35:18.067 --> 00:35:24.267
It sinks and then it spreads
northwards as a tongue, again,

00:35:24.267 --> 00:35:25.733
reaching the Equator.

00:35:25.733 --> 00:35:28.233
Actually going a little bit
north of the Equator.

00:35:28.233 --> 00:35:31.000
That's called the Antarctic
Intermediate Water, AAIW.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.533
There's also a water
mass here.

00:35:38.533 --> 00:35:40.100
It's formed in the
North Atlantic.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:44.233
It sinks and it spreads
southward getting

00:35:44.233 --> 00:35:47.267
south of the Equator.

00:35:47.267 --> 00:35:51.067
That's the North Atlantic Deep
Water, NADW, North Atlantic

00:35:51.067 --> 00:35:53.400
Deep Water.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.967
So what's going on in
all of these cases?

00:35:55.967 --> 00:35:58.900
At the surface of the ocean
where the atmosphere and the

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:05.033
ocean touch, the atmosphere
is imprinting a certain

00:36:05.033 --> 00:36:09.867
temperature salinity
characteristic to the water.

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:12.500
That determines the
water's density.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.700
That water will then sink down
to its appropriate density

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.500
level and spread out.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.233
That was a case for the
Antarctic Bottom Water, the

00:36:21.233 --> 00:36:23.567
Antarctic Intermediate
Water, and the north

00:36:23.567 --> 00:36:25.033
Atlantic Deep Water.

00:36:25.033 --> 00:36:29.267
Notice, their roots all go back
to the surface of the

00:36:29.267 --> 00:36:32.767
ocean, because that's where they
can get their properties.

00:36:32.767 --> 00:36:35.067
They get the temperature from
the heat fluxes, they get

00:36:35.067 --> 00:36:38.233
their salinity from the fresh
water fluxes, and then they

00:36:38.233 --> 00:36:40.967
sink and they spread out and
they're found thousands of

00:36:40.967 --> 00:36:43.967
kilometers away from where they
were formed, and moving

00:36:43.967 --> 00:36:48.400
very slowly there under the
direction of these currents.

00:36:52.267 --> 00:36:55.600
Oxygen doesn't play any role
in how these water masses

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.133
move, but they provide
a good tracer.

00:36:58.133 --> 00:37:02.367
Here's dissolved oxygen,
and you find the

00:37:02.367 --> 00:37:04.867
lowest values here.

00:37:04.867 --> 00:37:07.367
And notice this curious
structure.

00:37:07.367 --> 00:37:11.600
Right at the ocean surface, of
course, you find the highest

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.633
values of oxygen.

00:37:12.633 --> 00:37:17.167
Well, the oxygen is being taken
in from the atmosphere,

00:37:17.167 --> 00:37:21.233
mixed down a couple of hundred
meters, and then following

00:37:21.233 --> 00:37:24.267
that water mass here it is
following the north Atlantic

00:37:24.267 --> 00:37:28.933
Deep Water, here it is following
the Antarctic

00:37:28.933 --> 00:37:31.533
Intermediate Water
right there.

00:37:31.533 --> 00:37:39.833
But surprisingly, the lowest
oxygen is in the tropics, just

00:37:39.833 --> 00:37:41.833
below the--not touching the
atmosphere, but just below it.

00:37:41.833 --> 00:37:45.300
So there's not a very good
communication or mixing

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.467
between the surface of the ocean
and this water or it

00:37:48.467 --> 00:37:51.367
wouldn't have that
depleted oxygen.

00:37:51.367 --> 00:37:54.400
The reason why there is not
strong communication there is

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.633
because it's very stable.

00:37:55.633 --> 00:37:58.533
There's a thermocline there,
just like an inversion in the

00:37:58.533 --> 00:38:02.100
atmosphere prevents
vertical mixing.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:06.767
So you get this strongly
depleted oxygen water here, so

00:38:06.767 --> 00:38:11.967
close to its oxygen source, but
yet cut off by this stable

00:38:11.967 --> 00:38:14.000
inversion preventing
vertical mixing.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.233
So we can--

00:38:18.133 --> 00:38:18.667
Yeah, question.

00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:21.667
STUDENT: Is the oxygen depleted
there because

00:38:21.667 --> 00:38:23.533
organisms use it up?

00:38:23.533 --> 00:38:26.600
PROFESSOR: Organisms
use as soon as the water

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:31.033
leaves I should have said this,
thanks Julia as soon as

00:38:31.033 --> 00:38:34.400
the water leaves the surface
it begins to lose oxygen

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:39.700
because animals use it up, and
respiration takes place to use

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.267
up the oxygen.

00:38:40.267 --> 00:38:44.067
So the older the water is, the
less oxygen it has in it.

00:38:44.067 --> 00:38:47.167
STUDENT: And so the fact that
the oxygen can mix more deeply

00:38:47.167 --> 00:38:49.567
in other regions of the world,
does that mean that it won't

00:38:49.567 --> 00:38:52.133
be used up as--

00:38:52.133 --> 00:38:53.600
PROFESSOR: No, it
might mean that, but it might

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:57.067
just mean that that water has
been down there a longer

00:38:57.067 --> 00:38:58.333
period of time.

00:39:02.033 --> 00:39:05.700
So the cartoon then of the
Atlantic Ocean, the same

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.900
north-south section I've been
telling you about, south to

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.367
north, looks like this.

00:39:10.367 --> 00:39:15.300
You've got this warm surface
water heated by the Sun kind

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.600
of floating, it's
quite shallow.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.833
You've got the Antarctic
Intermediate Water coming in

00:39:21.833 --> 00:39:24.167
here, you've got the North
Atlantic Deep Water, and then

00:39:24.167 --> 00:39:26.967
you've got the Antarctic
Bottom Water.

00:39:26.967 --> 00:39:29.233
Eventually they lose their
characteristics.

00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:32.767
They mix in with their
environments, but for at least

00:39:32.767 --> 00:39:35.600
hundreds, maybe thousands of
kilometers, during their

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.833
transport, they retain enough of
their property that we can

00:39:39.833 --> 00:39:43.933
identify them by where their
source region was.

00:39:43.933 --> 00:39:46.233
So this is the concept
of the water mass.

00:39:46.233 --> 00:39:50.400
In oceanography we have this
concept of the water mass.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.700
It's a mass of water obtaining
its temperature, salinity

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:58.267
properties at the air-sea
boundary, and then sinking and

00:39:58.267 --> 00:40:03.967
moving slowly, and for years
retaining that property until

00:40:03.967 --> 00:40:09.000
eventually it mixes in
with its environment.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.200
And these motions are
driven by these slow

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:16.467
thermohaline-driven currents.

00:40:16.467 --> 00:40:17.833
Questions on this?

00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:22.767
So this is the concept of the
water mass in oceanography.

00:40:22.767 --> 00:40:26.567
It's a bit like the concept of
the air mass in meteorology

00:40:26.567 --> 00:40:31.367
where on a day like this, cool,
brisk, I can say maybe

00:40:31.367 --> 00:40:33.533
this is a Canadian air mass.

00:40:33.533 --> 00:40:38.067
It got its dryness, its cool
temperatures in Canada, now

00:40:38.067 --> 00:40:41.867
it's moved down to me in New
England, but I know from its

00:40:41.867 --> 00:40:44.233
properties where it came from.

00:40:44.233 --> 00:40:47.833
Whereas a couple days from now
if it's really moist and humid

00:40:47.833 --> 00:40:52.167
and warm, likely that's
Caribbean air coming up from

00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:56.267
the Caribbean transported to my
location, retaining some of

00:40:56.267 --> 00:40:59.000
the properties it acquired
when it was down

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.033
in the lower latitudes.

00:41:01.033 --> 00:41:05.600
So the concepts are roughly
similar to each other.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:11.600
Now, I wanted to show you a
famous thermohaline current

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.667
called the conveyor
belt circulation.

00:41:14.667 --> 00:41:17.033
I wanted to show this diagram
again you've seen it before to

00:41:17.033 --> 00:41:23.600
remind you that the Atlantic
Ocean is slightly saltier than

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:29.167
the Pacific, and slightly
cooler than the Pacific,

00:41:29.167 --> 00:41:30.533
mostly just saltier.

00:41:30.533 --> 00:41:34.200
But as a result, the Atlantic
Ocean--look at the density

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.167
numbers--The Atlantic Ocean
water is on average slightly

00:41:37.167 --> 00:41:39.667
denser than the Pacific Ocean.

00:41:39.667 --> 00:41:42.300
So imagine you've got these
two oceans, OK, they're

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.767
separated by North and South
America, but they have

00:41:46.767 --> 00:41:49.500
different densities.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.967
If there's any leak between the
two of them, that's going

00:41:52.967 --> 00:41:56.700
to try to equilibrate by setting
up a circulation

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.433
between them, and that exactly
is what we think happens to

00:42:00.433 --> 00:42:03.667
give this large scale conveyor
belt circulation.

00:42:03.667 --> 00:42:06.533
Notice that in the Pacific
Ocean, the

00:42:06.533 --> 00:42:07.633
water is less dense.

00:42:07.633 --> 00:42:14.133
It seems to rise and then
flow into the Atlantic.

00:42:14.133 --> 00:42:17.367
The Atlantic Ocean being
somewhat denser, this water

00:42:17.367 --> 00:42:22.133
sinks, and then flows on the
bottom of the ocean back into

00:42:22.133 --> 00:42:22.900
the Pacific.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.433
So there's kind of an
overturning circulation.

00:42:26.433 --> 00:42:29.867
Now OK, it has to go through a
very circuitous route because

00:42:29.867 --> 00:42:31.200
they're not directly
connected.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.367
They can't make their way across
this barrier or across

00:42:34.367 --> 00:42:35.167
this barrier.

00:42:35.167 --> 00:42:39.500
But they do share the southern
Ocean in common.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.633
So they can communicate and
close this circulation by

00:42:43.633 --> 00:42:46.733
running the currents down
through the Southern Ocean.

00:42:46.733 --> 00:42:49.867
That's the conveyor
belt circulation.

00:42:53.567 --> 00:42:58.167
Another example of a slow
thermohaline circulation.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.667
A third example is the
estuary circulation.

00:43:03.667 --> 00:43:08.800
An estuary is defined as a
semi-enclosed body of water

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.233
with some connection
to the ocean, and

00:43:12.233 --> 00:43:14.633
with fresh water inputs.

00:43:14.633 --> 00:43:17.433
Long Island Sound would be
a good example of that.

00:43:17.433 --> 00:43:21.500
There are fresh water inputs
the Connecticut River, the

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.867
Quinnipiac River that we
studied, the Housatonic River.

00:43:25.867 --> 00:43:29.033
And there is a connection to
the ocean that goes out

00:43:29.033 --> 00:43:32.467
through the race here so
that you can mix ocean

00:43:32.467 --> 00:43:34.033
water in and out.

00:43:34.033 --> 00:43:37.167
What we find is that while the
ocean salinity is typically 35

00:43:37.167 --> 00:43:40.300
parts per thousand, the salinity
in Long Island

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.867
Sound's only about 20
parts per thousand.

00:43:42.867 --> 00:43:46.567
I think in your field trip you
found 18, but generally that's

00:43:46.567 --> 00:43:48.633
pretty close to this.

00:43:48.633 --> 00:43:51.700
So what's happening is it's a
place where mixing occurs

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.267
between fresh water coming off
the land and ocean water

00:43:55.267 --> 00:43:58.433
mixing in from the ocean.

00:43:58.433 --> 00:44:03.400
So remember, salty
water is denser.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.333
Fresher water is less dense.

00:44:05.333 --> 00:44:12.600
So what happens is that the
denser, fully salt ocean water

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:19.333
slides in along the bottom, has
fresh water added to it,

00:44:19.333 --> 00:44:23.533
making it less dense so it
rises, and then it floats out

00:44:23.533 --> 00:44:24.367
on the top.

00:44:24.367 --> 00:44:26.900
So right through here there's
going to be a two-layer

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.267
circulation.

00:44:28.267 --> 00:44:33.800
It's illustrated up here with
the fresh water being added,

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.467
and that slightly reduced
salinity water flowing out of

00:44:37.467 --> 00:44:39.967
the top, and the full
ocean water

00:44:39.967 --> 00:44:41.100
flowing in at the bottom.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.733
So you get a two-layer
circulation right at the

00:44:43.733 --> 00:44:47.733
entrance region to an estuary,
driven by this salinity

00:44:47.733 --> 00:44:49.267
difference.

00:44:49.267 --> 00:44:53.600
That would be called a
thermohaline circulation.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.900
Does everybody get that?

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:55.767
What's driving it?

00:44:55.767 --> 00:45:00.567
So if I turned off these rivers
in some magical way,

00:45:00.567 --> 00:45:04.000
and let the mixing continue,
after a few months, this would

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.067
come up to 35 parts
per thousand.

00:45:06.067 --> 00:45:08.300
It's the fresh water inputs
that's keeping this

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.767
lower than the 35.

00:45:10.767 --> 00:45:13.533
And it's that two-layer
circulation that's providing

00:45:13.533 --> 00:45:17.500
the mixing between the estuary
and the open ocean.

00:45:20.967 --> 00:45:21.733
Questions there?

00:45:21.733 --> 00:45:22.200
Yeah.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.167
STUDENT: So it's still called a
thermohaline, even though in

00:45:24.167 --> 00:45:27.367
this case it's just driven
by salinity?

00:45:27.367 --> 00:45:28.067
PROFESSOR: True.

00:45:28.067 --> 00:45:30.967
Because you still got the
haline part of it.

00:45:30.967 --> 00:45:32.233
So it would still be called
thermohaline.

00:45:35.133 --> 00:45:39.567
The Mediterranean Sea has one of
these, but it works just in

00:45:39.567 --> 00:45:40.833
the opposite direction.

00:45:40.833 --> 00:45:44.367
Remember, the Mediterranean
Sea is, especially in

00:45:44.367 --> 00:45:46.667
summertime, a very
dry climate.

00:45:46.667 --> 00:45:49.300
It doesn't rain there, and
there's an excess of

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.533
evaporation over
precipitation.

00:45:52.533 --> 00:45:55.700
Even when you include the rivers
that flow into it,

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.367
there's an excess of
evaporation over

00:45:58.367 --> 00:46:00.433
precipitation.

00:46:00.433 --> 00:46:04.767
So it becomes saltier than
the ocean itself.

00:46:04.767 --> 00:46:06.233
And there is a connection.

00:46:06.233 --> 00:46:08.267
It's the Straits of Gibraltar.

00:46:08.267 --> 00:46:12.400
That little narrow connection
between Spain and Morocco that

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.200
allows some exchange to occur.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.467
Just remember now, in this case,
the Mediterranean water,

00:46:20.467 --> 00:46:23.400
while it's fairly warm, the
salt outweighs that.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.933
It's a denser water mass.

00:46:25.933 --> 00:46:27.833
So here's a cross section
through the Straits of

00:46:27.833 --> 00:46:30.033
Gibraltar, and here's the

00:46:30.033 --> 00:46:31.433
Mediterranean Sea in the ocean.

00:46:31.433 --> 00:46:36.133
So that dense, salty water
flows out on the bottom,

00:46:36.133 --> 00:46:40.133
because it's denser, and the
ocean water at 35 parts per

00:46:40.133 --> 00:46:42.867
thousand flows in on the top.

00:46:42.867 --> 00:46:49.233
A two-layer circulation driven
by the salt difference.

00:46:49.233 --> 00:46:54.867
Just remember, it's opposite in
a sense to the estuary that

00:46:54.867 --> 00:46:57.300
I showed you just before this.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.300
This has a place in
the history books.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:05.767
In both World Wars, the German
U-boat captains knew about

00:47:05.767 --> 00:47:10.467
this, and the British had set
up a sonar listening station

00:47:10.467 --> 00:47:16.267
at Gibraltar to listen for the
engines of U-boats trying to

00:47:16.267 --> 00:47:19.667
get in and out of the
Mediterranean Sea.

00:47:19.667 --> 00:47:24.767
But the U-boats captains
realized they could come out

00:47:24.767 --> 00:47:28.133
to this place, drop down about
100 meters, turn off their

00:47:28.133 --> 00:47:34.867
engines, and then just drift
silently past the British into

00:47:34.867 --> 00:47:35.967
the Mediterranean.

00:47:35.967 --> 00:47:39.400
Then they could start their
engines, sink a few ships, and

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.933
when they wanted to come back
home, they would come over

00:47:41.933 --> 00:47:45.900
here, sink a bit deeper, turn
off their engines, and this

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:50.167
current would take them back out
into the Atlantic past the

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:51.700
British sonar station.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.733
So this was known at the
time, and it was used

00:47:54.733 --> 00:47:56.400
in a military fashion.

00:47:59.133 --> 00:48:00.467
Questions on that?

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.667
Now, we've got to get to the
wind driven currents.

00:48:04.667 --> 00:48:08.067
We won't get very far on it
today, but I wanted to alert

00:48:08.067 --> 00:48:11.933
you to the complexity
of this subject.

00:48:11.933 --> 00:48:16.367
We've got to think of a chain
of events that occurs as to

00:48:16.367 --> 00:48:19.100
how the wind generates the
major ocean currents.

00:48:21.933 --> 00:48:24.533
And there are four
bullets to this.

00:48:24.533 --> 00:48:27.667
The wind stress acts
on the ocean as

00:48:27.667 --> 00:48:30.033
the frictional stress.

00:48:30.033 --> 00:48:33.700
That generates an Ekman layer,
which moves water off at right

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.300
angles to the wind stress.

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:41.300
That Ekman layer air flow then
piles up water in certain

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.533
parts of the world ocean,
giving a little bit of

00:48:43.533 --> 00:48:45.667
elevation variation.

00:48:45.667 --> 00:48:48.267
We call that ocean topography.

00:48:48.267 --> 00:48:51.500
It's not large, it's only a
few centimeters or tens of

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.567
centimeters, but it's
very important.

00:48:54.567 --> 00:48:57.633
And then that ocean topography,
through the

00:48:57.633 --> 00:49:01.567
hydrostatic law, sets up
horizontal pressure gradients

00:49:01.567 --> 00:49:03.367
in the ocean.

00:49:03.367 --> 00:49:06.467
If the water's heaped up here
and a little lower here,

00:49:06.467 --> 00:49:08.500
you're going to have higher
pressure under the heaped up

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.500
water, lower pressure under
the lower water.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.833
So you're going to have a
horizontal pressure gradient.

00:49:13.833 --> 00:49:15.833
If you have a horizontal
pressure gradient, I think you

00:49:15.833 --> 00:49:17.133
know what's going to happen.

00:49:17.133 --> 00:49:20.467
You're going to set up a
geostrophic current.

00:49:20.467 --> 00:49:22.233
A few hours later, you're
going to have a

00:49:22.233 --> 00:49:24.533
geostrophically balanced
current, and that's going to

00:49:24.533 --> 00:49:27.200
be an ocean current this time.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.600
So that's what we're going
to be looking for.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.533
So the winds over the ocean, for
example, in the Atlantic

00:49:34.533 --> 00:49:38.667
Ocean, the winds in the tropical
regions are from east

00:49:38.667 --> 00:49:43.033
to west. The Ekman flux will
be towards the north.

00:49:43.033 --> 00:49:45.067
Up in mid-latitudes, the
winds are westerlies.

00:49:45.067 --> 00:49:48.633
The Ekman flux is toward
the south.

00:49:48.633 --> 00:49:51.933
The Ekman flow is going to pile
up water in the middle of

00:49:51.933 --> 00:49:53.400
the Atlantic.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.333
And then with that high
pressure, you're going to

00:49:56.333 --> 00:50:00.500
generate an anti-cyclone in
the way of ocean currents

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:03.300
around that going in this
same direction.

00:50:07.467 --> 00:50:10.867
And for years and years, the
theoretical oceanographers

00:50:10.867 --> 00:50:13.067
knew that that little
variation in sea

00:50:13.067 --> 00:50:15.967
level had to be there.

00:50:15.967 --> 00:50:22.100
But finally about 15 years ago
well, more than that now we

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:25.433
were able to measure this for
the first time by flying a

00:50:25.433 --> 00:50:30.767
satellite in orbit and having
a laser point down from the

00:50:30.767 --> 00:50:34.667
satellite, bounce it off the
ocean surface, time how long

00:50:34.667 --> 00:50:36.267
it takes to get that
signal down and

00:50:36.267 --> 00:50:37.533
back up to the satellite.

00:50:40.333 --> 00:50:42.867
We were able to measure ocean
height for the first time

00:50:42.867 --> 00:50:46.933
within a few centimeters
of accuracy.

00:50:46.933 --> 00:50:50.467
Then for the first time, we were
able to actually make a

00:50:50.467 --> 00:50:53.567
map of this tiny little
elevation

00:50:53.567 --> 00:50:54.433
in the Earth's surface.

00:50:54.433 --> 00:50:55.700
And here it is.

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.133
It's called Ocean Dynamic
Topography.

00:50:58.133 --> 00:51:01.367
It's given in units
of centimeters.

00:51:01.367 --> 00:51:05.433
And for example, when you see
red here, the water is piled

00:51:05.433 --> 00:51:09.167
up about that much.

00:51:09.167 --> 00:51:11.200
So you wouldn't ever notice
this if you were sailing

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.133
across the ocean.

00:51:12.133 --> 00:51:13.933
Remember, the ocean's five
kilometers deep.

00:51:13.933 --> 00:51:15.800
What does 40 centimeters mean?

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:21.300
But this is relative to the
geoid, relative to a constant

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.500
level surface on the ocean.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.600
And it's that piling up then
that gives rise to a pressure

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:31.067
gradient that then causes
the major ocean

00:51:31.067 --> 00:51:32.700
currents in the ocean.

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.367
We're out of time, but this will
be the theme on Monday.

00:51:35.367 --> 00:51:37.200
We'll talk about how these
currents get moving.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.456
Professor John Rogers:
Let's begin.

00:00:03.456 --> 00:00:06.150
We looked last time at Saint
Peter's declamatory speech in

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.750
"Lycidas," and we spent a
lot of time on it.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.809
We looked at its relation to
the new career that John Milton

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.561
ended up assuming in the late
1630s: this new career as a

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:24.670
polemical writer of political
prose.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.602
Milton becomes increasingly in
this period -- and this is the

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:32.479
period of the English
Revolution.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.580
What is the English Revolution,
you ask?

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.197
Well, that's a good question
and there are still innumerable,

00:00:39.197 --> 00:00:41.790
often competing answers to that
question.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.231
It seems to be more or less --
this is one way of framing an

00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:48.790
answer -- it seems more or less
to be a Puritan Revolution.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.306
Middle-class Puritans like John
Milton find themselves upholding

00:00:54.306 --> 00:00:59.648
the authority of Parliament over
the authority of King Charles

00:00:59.648 --> 00:01:04.989
and over the authority of the
official Church of England.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.877
That's the roughest possible
sketch of what the English

00:01:08.877 --> 00:01:12.980
Revolution is.We find
ourselves in today's reading,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.081
Areopagitica,
in the middle of the

00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:17.551
English Revolution,
sometimes called the Puritan

00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:20.865
Revolution.
It's in this period that Milton

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:25.182
increasingly begins to adopt,
or assume, Saint Peter's

00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:28.360
confident and denunciatory
rhetoric.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.849
He adopts it as his own,
Milton does.

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:36.332
He writes a series of treatises
in support of -- this is really

00:01:36.332 --> 00:01:40.019
out there, and he alienates a
lot of his natural,

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:43.543
organic base with these actions
-- Milton writes a series of

00:01:43.543 --> 00:01:46.349
treatises in support of the
right to divorce,

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:49.144
divorce for reasons for
incompatibility,

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:52.440
and he continues to assist the
Puritan left,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.285
the progressive movement,
in overthrowing the

00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:58.519
hierarchical structure of the
Church of England.

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:01.090
The bishops,
also called prelates --

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.906
those church officials
essentially appointed by

00:02:03.906 --> 00:02:07.725
Archbishop William Laud,
whom we looked at last time --

00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:12.077
were replaced in the early 1640s
by means of the success of the

00:02:12.077 --> 00:02:15.938
Puritan revolutionaries and were
replaced by presbyters:

00:02:15.938 --> 00:02:20.080
ministers who were chosen by
individual congregations.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.709
Milton was able to think of
this new form of church

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.181
government as the most
reasonable form of church

00:02:25.181 --> 00:02:28.283
government because it seemed to
be the product of individual

00:02:28.283 --> 00:02:31.388
choices.
It seemed to be the product of

00:02:31.388 --> 00:02:36.203
individual decisions made by the
rational, churchgoing English

00:02:36.203 --> 00:02:39.440
public.By the time we get to
1644,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.009
this is the year that
Areopagitica appears,

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:44.160
we're well into the English
Revolution.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.961
This is the year in which we
have two dominant groups in the

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:55.530
new revolutionary Parliament.
You have the conservative,

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.379
Anglican royalists.
They've already been ousted.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.384
They're no longer a central
component of the political

00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:06.360
scene.
You have left the Presbyterians

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.369
and the Independents,
and at this point the

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.020
Presbyterians are in firm
control.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.950
Now as with most political
groups who suddenly find

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.524
themselves -- and this is just
an ancient piece of wisdom that

00:03:18.524 --> 00:03:21.382
I'm sharing with you,
but it's something obviously

00:03:21.382 --> 00:03:24.517
that you will have heard before
-- as with most political groups

00:03:24.517 --> 00:03:27.352
who suddenly find themselves in
possession of a measure of

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:29.812
power,
the ideas and values of the

00:03:29.812 --> 00:03:32.857
Presbyterians,
who had of course started out

00:03:32.857 --> 00:03:36.163
as radicals,
were beginning to harden into

00:03:36.163 --> 00:03:40.650
something like a new orthodoxy
with this new aggregation of

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.906
political power.
They began laboring to suppress

00:03:44.906 --> 00:03:49.580
and laboring to stamp out forces
that opposed them,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.913
whether those forces were on
the right or on the left.Now

00:03:52.913 --> 00:03:56.023
of course, the presbyters had
seized control in the first

00:03:56.023 --> 00:03:59.301
place because they disapproved
of the tactics of suppression

00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:02.689
and intervention that had been
deployed by the bishops,

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.560
or the prelates,
of the old church.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.473
But the new Presbyterian Party
soon developed its own methods

00:04:10.473 --> 00:04:15.550
of employing state power to
control and regulate the church.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.427
This is just a general
historical irony that surely at

00:04:19.427 --> 00:04:22.939
some point besets all
revolutionary movements,

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:26.830
and it's an irony that
particularly appalled John

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.564
Milton.
It's in recognition of what we

00:04:29.564 --> 00:04:32.839
can think of as this
time-honored historical irony

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:35.779
that Milton writes such a
memorable line,

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:39.177
a wonderful line,
in his sonnet on the new

00:04:39.177 --> 00:04:43.229
Presbyterian regime.
It's the poem of the "…

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.829
New Forcers of
Conscience…"

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:51.464
which ends with that line,
you'll remember:

00:04:51.464 --> 00:04:57.769
"New Presbyter is but Old
Priest writ Large."

00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:01.840
The Revolution has essentially
become a revolution in name

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.855
only.
Priests, these are the bishops

00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:06.078
of the old system,
have changed their name to

00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:07.810
presbyters,
 perhaps,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.236
and they look like
revolutionaries,

00:05:09.236 --> 00:05:12.373
but they're manipulative,
controlling actions haven't

00:05:12.373 --> 00:05:17.556
essentially changed at all.
And for the Presbyterian Party

00:05:17.556 --> 00:05:24.059
in 1644, it turns out there are
in fact a number of factions to

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:28.779
control and to manipulate and to
regulate.

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:32.231
Professor John Rogers:
The new Presbyterian

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:35.823
orthodoxy soon [laughs]
developed its own methods of

00:05:35.823 --> 00:05:38.430
employing state power to
control,

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.120
to regulate,
and to manipulate the church.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.683
That's where we get this
rousing line,

00:05:44.683 --> 00:05:47.940
"New Presbyter is but Old
Priest writ Large."

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.187
I had mentioned the various
factions in Parliament that the

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:59.728
Presbyterian Party had to
confront: the Independents who

00:05:59.728 --> 00:06:03.860
are to the left of the
Presbyterians.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.009
We can count John Milton as a
supporter of the Independents.

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.376
The Independents resented the
new authoritarianism of the

00:06:10.376 --> 00:06:12.540
Presbyterians,
and they supported,

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.030
or at least they tolerated,
a new phenomenon -- a

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.540
relatively new phenomenon on the
English cultural landscape.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.519
This is the freedom of the
printing press.

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:26.069
It's a freedom that,
of course, Parliament had

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.810
pushed for, but now that they've
got it there is some misgiving.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.907
From 1641 to 1643,
there had been an unprecedented

00:06:34.907 --> 00:06:40.110
explosion of printing and
publishing in England.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.328
Every conceivable Protestant
sect was publishing treatises of

00:06:44.328 --> 00:06:47.844
theological speculation and
publishing treatises of

00:06:47.844 --> 00:06:51.360
religious propaganda at an
extraordinary rate.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.850
It's really a remarkable thing
that happens in the

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.910
mid-century.Religious
propaganda of course -- and this

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.686
is always the case --
unregulated religious propaganda

00:07:02.686 --> 00:07:06.746
only breeds more unregulated
religious propaganda and more

00:07:06.746 --> 00:07:11.033
religious division.
By the end of the period there

00:07:11.033 --> 00:07:15.209
was an unprecedented number of
new religious groups.

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:21.259
Some of these groups born at
this moment still exist.

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:24.901
We still have the Quakers,
we have the Baptists,

00:07:24.901 --> 00:07:28.387
but there are,
of course, many groups thriving

00:07:28.387 --> 00:07:32.028
in the 1640s that have
absolutely faded from the

00:07:32.028 --> 00:07:34.740
religious scene:
the Ranters,

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.420
the Familists,
and the Muggletonians.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.383
These are churches of almost
every imaginable stripe,

00:07:40.383 --> 00:07:44.403
and they're springing up and,
from a mainstream perspective,

00:07:44.403 --> 00:07:48.383
they're quickly eroding the
authority of the Church of

00:07:48.383 --> 00:07:51.290
England.
It was becoming absolutely

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.250
impossible, in fact,
or at least much,

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.022
much harder,
to claim that there was a

00:07:57.022 --> 00:08:00.546
single expression of religious
truth to which the English

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:03.000
nation could consensually
subscribe.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.844
And suddenly there are dozens
and dozens of competing

00:08:05.844 --> 00:08:09.064
expressions of religious truth,
and so you have a new

00:08:09.064 --> 00:08:12.970
proliferation of new religions
and new religious ideas that

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.809
comes about as the immediate
product of the freedom of the

00:08:16.809 --> 00:08:18.715
press.
It's in this decade,

00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:21.279
in fact, that we have the first
newspapers.

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:25.702
The printed word begins to take
on -- assumes a political and a

00:08:25.702 --> 00:08:29.625
cultural importance that it had
never had before.The

00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:33.620
proliferation of religious texts
and the proliferation of

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.329
religious sects produced what
was widely seen to be a

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:42.179
potentially anarchic political
situation in the early 1640s.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:46.939
It's in response to what was
deemed to be the chaotic

00:08:46.939 --> 00:08:51.150
condition of English religious
culture that the

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:56.184
Presbyterian-led Parliament
issued in 1643 the Licensing

00:08:56.184 --> 00:08:59.737
Act.
The Presbyterians needed to

00:08:59.737 --> 00:09:05.599
halt the endless generation of
dangerous religious propaganda

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:11.363
and continued what they felt on
some level was the continued

00:09:11.363 --> 00:09:16.620
metastasis of Protestant sects.
This is a recurring rhetoric,

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.980
this notion that there is a
cancer in the body politic.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:25.110
Parliament enacts through this
legislation a mechanism for the

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:30.200
state control of the press.
Books now have to be licensed.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.336
They have to be preapproved by
the state before they can

00:09:33.336 --> 00:09:36.873
actually be published.In the
controversies that are leading

00:09:36.873 --> 00:09:40.209
up to the Licensing Act,
one of the authors most

00:09:40.209 --> 00:09:45.049
frequently mentioned as posing a
special threat to the well-being

00:09:45.049 --> 00:09:48.679
of the English nation is our
very own Milton.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:52.283
The treatises that he had
written in favor of the right to

00:09:52.283 --> 00:09:55.570
divorce for reasons of
incompatibility in the earlier

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.541
1640s had scandalized his
contemporaries and had

00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:02.018
especially scandalized his
Puritan contemporaries on the

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:05.009
left.
Milton was particularly singled

00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:08.789
out as one of these dangerous
new voices that had to be

00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:12.108
stopped.
In a sermon that was preached

00:10:12.108 --> 00:10:16.590
to Parliament in August of 1644
by Herbert Palmer,

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:22.959
it's Milton whose name is cited
as one of the as one of those

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:29.222
figures most dangerous to the
state.Now my guess is that

00:10:29.222 --> 00:10:35.909
maybe not all of you but some of
you will have heard about,

00:10:35.909 --> 00:10:39.063
or perhaps actually have read
snippets from,

00:10:39.063 --> 00:10:42.070
today's reading:
this amazing treatise,

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.419
long before you got to it last
night, Areopagitica.

00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:48.082
This is without question
one of the English language's

00:10:48.082 --> 00:10:51.874
most powerful and most rousing
expressions of the freedom of

00:10:51.874 --> 00:10:55.730
the press and actually of a kind
of libertarian philosophy in

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.362
general.
The argumentative logic of

00:10:59.362 --> 00:11:05.458
Areopagitica rests on a
distinction between external

00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:08.151
compulsion,
on the one hand,

00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:12.428
and internal discipline on the
other, internal discipline

00:11:12.428 --> 00:11:16.017
looking something like an
internalization of the

00:11:16.017 --> 00:11:19.759
discipline and the authority of
the monarch.

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:23.534
We have the compelling,
official authority of the new

00:11:23.534 --> 00:11:26.727
state licenser,
and Milton pits that external

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:30.937
state of power against the
powers of reason and against the

00:11:30.937 --> 00:11:35.487
powers of conscience that,
of course, were seen to govern

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:39.570
human action from within -- an
internalized authority.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.235
It's, of course,
not just John Milton who's

00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:44.899
authorized to determine his own
actions.

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:47.873
Everyone, according to the
logic of Areopagitica,

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:51.489
everyone has the potential
to assume the inner authority of

00:11:51.489 --> 00:11:56.740
conscience and self-discipline.
Everyone has potentially a

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:02.791
licenser within himself,
and so there's no need --

00:12:02.791 --> 00:12:09.831
there's no logical need for a
state licenser.There are

00:12:09.831 --> 00:12:17.364
some passages in Areopagitica
that I would be remiss to

00:12:17.364 --> 00:12:23.334
overlook,
so I'm going to ask you to turn

00:12:23.334 --> 00:12:28.272
to page 739 in the Hughes.
Milton's arguing that

00:12:28.272 --> 00:12:30.847
there's no authority that can
rightfully exist outside of the

00:12:30.847 --> 00:12:33.325
conscience of the individual.
Even religious truths,

00:12:33.325 --> 00:12:35.586
which, of course,
are the most potent forms of

00:12:35.586 --> 00:12:38.451
knowledge that we have -- even
religious truths have to be

00:12:38.451 --> 00:12:41.700
subjected to the final arbiter,
who is the individual's

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.769
conscience and the individual's
power of reason.

00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:47.264
Milton is taking the argument
at so many points in

00:12:47.264 --> 00:12:49.860
Areopagitica as far as he
can possibly go.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:56.418
This is page 739: 
A man may be a heretic in

00:12:56.418 --> 00:13:01.868
the truth [Milton writes];
and if he believe things only

00:13:01.868 --> 00:13:06.279
because his pastor says so,
or the Assembly so determines,

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:11.429
without knowing other reason,
though his belief be true,

00:13:11.429 --> 00:13:16.580
yet the very truth he holds
becomes his heresy.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.000
Think of that,
"though his belief be true."

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.519
Expand in your minds the
implications,

00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:24.970
the possible consequences of
this.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.819
Any belief is heresy if you
haven't managed to determine

00:13:29.819 --> 00:13:33.797
that belief for yourself,
if you haven't managed to

00:13:33.797 --> 00:13:37.567
determine that belief on the
basis of your own conscience or

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:40.889
through the powers of your own
faculty of reason.

00:13:40.889 --> 00:13:44.871
You can be a heretic in the
truth if you accept a belief,

00:13:44.871 --> 00:13:49.279
however true that belief turns
out to be at the end of time,

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:53.804
when we enter the pearly gates
and we finally get the last

00:13:53.804 --> 00:13:56.233
word.
You're a heretic because you've

00:13:56.233 --> 00:13:59.617
accepted that belief only
because it's been handed to you

00:13:59.617 --> 00:14:03.758
by an external authority,
an external authority like a

00:14:03.758 --> 00:14:08.656
pastor or a bishop or a member
of the state assembly or a

00:14:08.656 --> 00:14:13.379
lecturer in the English
department for that matter.

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:17.307
It is your obligation,
Milton argues in this

00:14:17.307 --> 00:14:21.875
remarkable treatise,
to determine for yourself what

00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:26.302
will constitute truth.
All truths have to be acquired

00:14:26.302 --> 00:14:29.312
directly by the
individual.It's perfectly

00:14:29.312 --> 00:14:31.951
impossible,
I think, to imagine a stronger

00:14:31.951 --> 00:14:35.090
statement than this of the
authority that Milton gives,

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.108
the intellectual
self-possession that he

00:14:38.108 --> 00:14:41.776
ascribes, to the individual.
I think you can see why

00:14:41.776 --> 00:14:45.173
Areopagitica has been
memorialized for centuries now

00:14:45.173 --> 00:14:47.398
as one of the central
precursors, well,

00:14:47.398 --> 00:14:51.156
to a number of things.
One of them would be the

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:54.240
eighteenth-century
enlightenment.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.119
It's subsequently seen as one
of the precursors of the First

00:14:59.119 --> 00:15:02.509
Amendment to the American
Constitution.

00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:06.124
It's here in Areopagitica
that we find one of the

00:15:06.124 --> 00:15:10.068
first expressions of the idea
that an individual's freedom to

00:15:10.068 --> 00:15:13.288
read and the individual's
freedom to write is more

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:15.856
important,
it outweighs in value,

00:15:15.856 --> 00:15:20.129
the state's right to limit the
individual's freedom to read and

00:15:20.129 --> 00:15:22.679
the individual's freedom to
write.

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:26.910
Whatever danger a particular
text may pose to the state is

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.363
outweighed by the greater harm
of the official elimination of

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:35.520
that text or by the greater harm
of the punishment of the

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.379
author.In light of what we
have to concede is the

00:15:39.379 --> 00:15:43.610
extraordinary achievement of
Areopagitica,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.434
 and in light of its
reputation as one of the

00:15:46.434 --> 00:15:49.370
foundational texts for the
principle of the freedom of

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.400
speech,
readers have been puzzled --

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.982
and they have been rightly
puzzled -- by the fact that

00:15:56.982 --> 00:16:01.478
nowhere in Areopagitica
does Milton explicitly

00:16:01.478 --> 00:16:05.807
denounce censorship.
Milton doesn't denounce

00:16:05.807 --> 00:16:09.669
censorship at all,
although it comes up.

00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:12.900
In fact, he even claims -- and
he does this explicitly in

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.072
Areopagitica and you
might have caught this -- he

00:16:16.072 --> 00:16:19.879
even claims to be in favor of
censorship in a number of cases.

00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:24.297
Milton's argument in this
treatise is directed exclusively

00:16:24.297 --> 00:16:26.594
at licensing.
Licensing differs from

00:16:26.594 --> 00:16:28.399
censorship in some important
ways.

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:32.970
Indulge me in making this
important distinction.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.448
We know what censorship is.
Censorship is the banning of

00:16:36.448 --> 00:16:39.833
books that have been published
and that have been deemed by the

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:42.618
state authorities to be
dangerous or harmful in some

00:16:42.618 --> 00:16:45.067
way.
Censorship would involve the

00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:48.352
burning of books,
the prohibition of any further

00:16:48.352 --> 00:16:52.036
editions of those books,
or perhaps even a punishment --

00:16:52.036 --> 00:16:54.180
by imprisonment,
say -- of the author,

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.309
or maybe the printer or the
publisher of the books.

00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:59.270
That's censorship,
utterly

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:03.035
straightforward.Licensing,
on the other hand,

00:17:03.035 --> 00:17:06.329
is an action that precedes
censorship.

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:10.523
According to the 1643 Licensing
Order against which Milton is

00:17:10.523 --> 00:17:13.503
directing this treatise,
Areopagitica,

00:17:13.503 --> 00:17:17.284
a book has to be sent to
the licensing office for

00:17:17.284 --> 00:17:20.119
approval before it can be
published.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:24.376
The licensing agent reads the
book and determines whether or

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:28.559
not to print it at all or
license it to appear in print.

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:32.849
This isn't simply a distinction
without a difference.

00:17:32.849 --> 00:17:36.684
Milton places an enormous
amount of weight on this

00:17:36.684 --> 00:17:39.810
distinction.
Censorship only comes into play

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.609
once a text has actually been in
circulation for a while,

00:17:43.609 --> 00:17:48.923
only after a number of readers
have found a published text to

00:17:48.923 --> 00:17:52.434
pose a threat.
Only after that point can a

00:17:52.434 --> 00:17:57.230
text actually be censored.
The book has to be tested.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:01.273
It has to be tried by the
public, by a reading public,

00:18:01.273 --> 00:18:07.571
before it can be censored.
It's censorship by consensus

00:18:07.571 --> 00:18:10.975
almost.
And the truth of whether a book

00:18:10.975 --> 00:18:15.407
should or should not be censored
is something that's come about

00:18:15.407 --> 00:18:18.410
through the diligent effort of a
group,

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:22.716
rather than a single arbitrary
judge like the state

00:18:22.716 --> 00:18:27.798
licenser.Milton devotes a
lot of time in Areopagitica

00:18:27.798 --> 00:18:31.933
to making a number of
attempts to distinguish

00:18:31.933 --> 00:18:36.353
licensing from censorship.
You can see him actually making

00:18:36.353 --> 00:18:38.995
this distinction.
What I am interested in here,

00:18:38.995 --> 00:18:42.173
and I think what a lot of
readers are interested in when

00:18:42.173 --> 00:18:45.955
they approach Areopagitica,
is why this treatise,

00:18:45.955 --> 00:18:50.532
which does in fact permit the
practice of censorship -- why it

00:18:50.532 --> 00:18:54.960
can so easily be read as an
argument against censorship.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.362
In fact this treatise is often
described, or maybe even most

00:18:59.362 --> 00:19:02.720
commonly described,
as the Western tradition's

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.779
greatest argument against
censorship.

00:19:05.779 --> 00:19:08.434
Obviously, there's something
going on in this text that has

00:19:08.434 --> 00:19:10.813
produced this confusion,
or we could think of it as a

00:19:10.813 --> 00:19:13.971
misreading.
This is of some interest to us,

00:19:13.971 --> 00:19:18.435
so turn to the left-hand column
of page 720 in the Hughes

00:19:18.435 --> 00:19:23.219
edition. This is where
Milton speaks of the importance

00:19:23.219 --> 00:19:27.978
of censoring dangerous books.
Milton explains that the

00:19:27.978 --> 00:19:32.331
Licensing Order of 1643 is
ineffective, it's useless

00:19:32.331 --> 00:19:34.751
because,
and I'm quoting here,

00:19:34.751 --> 00:19:38.630
"rder avails nothing to the
suppressing of scandalous,

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:43.788
seditious, and libellous books,
which were mainly intended to

00:19:43.788 --> 00:19:47.019
be suppressed."
Milton's striking such a

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:51.740
strange authoritarian note here
that it's easy to skip over it.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.880
It seems unaccommodatable
almost.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.957
Look at the next paragraph: 
I deny not,

00:19:58.957 --> 00:20:02.736
but that it is of greatest
concernment in the church and

00:20:02.736 --> 00:20:06.765
the commonwealth,
to have a vigilant eye how

00:20:06.765 --> 00:20:10.849
books demean themselves as well
as men;

00:20:10.849 --> 00:20:15.836
and thereafter to confine,
imprison, and do sharpest

00:20:15.836 --> 00:20:19.650
justice on them as
malefactors.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.690
Now we know,
of course, that this is an

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.750
argument for censorship,
not an argument for licensing,

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.434
because the punishment of the
books and the implicit

00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:30.646
punishment of the men who write
those books occurs after their

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:33.836
appearance in print.
Milton then goes on to explain

00:20:33.836 --> 00:20:37.369
-- and I want you to look
closely at this -- Milton goes

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:41.029
on to explain why books need to
be brought to justice,

00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:45.140
why books need to be punished
essentially, like criminals in

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.440
Milton's personifying rhetoric.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.192
So Milton continues: 
For books are not

00:20:54.192 --> 00:20:58.023
absolutely dead things,
but do contain a potency of

00:20:58.023 --> 00:21:02.850
life in them to be as active as
that soul was whose progeny they

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.035
are;
nay, they do preserve as in a

00:21:06.035 --> 00:21:10.594
vial the purest efficacy and
extraction of that living

00:21:10.594 --> 00:21:14.500
intellect that bred them.
Okay. Let me stop there.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.592
The ostensible purpose of this
sentence at this point,

00:21:17.592 --> 00:21:19.867
as I take it,
in Milton's argument is to

00:21:19.867 --> 00:21:22.259
explain the importance of
censorship;

00:21:22.259 --> 00:21:27.220
but surely this sentence has an
entirely different effect on us

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:32.099
as readers, a different effect
than the syntax or the logic of

00:21:32.099 --> 00:21:35.492
this sentence may demand.
The scandalous,

00:21:35.492 --> 00:21:39.354
seditious and libelous books
that need to be brought to

00:21:39.354 --> 00:21:43.359
justice in this remarkable
sentence are suddenly revealed

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:47.079
to have a soul.
However dangerous books are,

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:51.660
in a lot of ways these books
look like good Christians.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.667
In fact, they're better than
good Christians because books

00:21:55.667 --> 00:21:58.690
are the purest,
the most rarified extract of

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:03.259
the originary goodness of the
author: an absolutely unfallen,

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:07.632
perfect creation.It's
important to understand that

00:22:07.632 --> 00:22:11.839
clearly something very strange
has happened here.

00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:14.411
This sentence,
which by the logic of the

00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:18.631
argument should be demonstrating
to us the importance of bringing

00:22:18.631 --> 00:22:22.317
bad books to justice,
seems to be doing something

00:22:22.317 --> 00:22:24.356
else.
In making this point,

00:22:24.356 --> 00:22:27.907
Milton has just made us,
I think, almost utterly

00:22:27.907 --> 00:22:32.970
unwilling to effect this justice
that he himself has called for.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:37.084
Which of us would want to
punish the purest efficacy of a

00:22:37.084 --> 00:22:42.150
living intellect?
It doesn't make sense.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:46.366
In the simplest possible terms,
you could say that Milton's

00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:50.001
sentence, Milton's argument here
in this paragraph,

00:22:50.001 --> 00:22:53.859
has gotten away from him.
There's a sense in which you

00:22:53.859 --> 00:22:57.359
can see this happening all the
time in Areopagitica.

00:22:57.359 --> 00:23:01.207
It's as if a gap has opened
up, a gap between the official

00:23:01.207 --> 00:23:05.118
argument of the treatise -- and
that's an argument that permits

00:23:05.118 --> 00:23:09.029
censorship -- and the rhetorical
figures or the metaphors,

00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:13.064
Milton's elaborately construed
language, which he uses to

00:23:13.064 --> 00:23:16.211
illustrate that argument.
The metaphors,

00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:21.272
or the rhetorical world of the
treatise, seem so often to be

00:23:21.272 --> 00:23:25.595
against censorship.
It's fairly easy to see that,

00:23:25.595 --> 00:23:29.541
at least in this case,
Milton's rhetoric and his

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:32.816
imagery begin to undo,
begin to unravel,

00:23:32.816 --> 00:23:37.968
the logic of the argument.
It's a process of undoing and

00:23:37.968 --> 00:23:42.450
undermining that really eats
away at the argument,

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.970
we could argue,
throughout the entirety of

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:50.949
Areopagitica.I'm
willing to bet that some of you

00:23:50.949 --> 00:23:54.470
had noted in your reading last
night,

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.620
or whenever you did your
reading, perhaps you actually

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.829
underlined the sentence that
we've just looked like.

00:24:00.829 --> 00:24:04.018
You underlined it perhaps
because you were convinced that

00:24:04.018 --> 00:24:06.579
this was Milton's wonderful and
liberatory,

00:24:06.579 --> 00:24:11.060
progressive celebration of the
absolute inviolability of the

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.050
written word.
If you did that,

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.282
on some level,
I think, you were absolutely

00:24:15.282 --> 00:24:18.365
right, even though you were
utterly misconstruing the logic

00:24:18.365 --> 00:24:19.960
of the [laughs]
argument.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.146
One of the most remarkable
things about this text is that

00:24:24.146 --> 00:24:29.014
it's invariably the soaring,
libertarian rhetoric that we

00:24:29.014 --> 00:24:32.856
end up noting,
that we end up remembering,

00:24:32.856 --> 00:24:37.542
and that sticks with
us.Turn to page 741 in the

00:24:37.542 --> 00:24:42.977
Hughes. This is where
Milton gives us his celebrated

00:24:42.977 --> 00:24:46.819
narrative of the history of
truth.

00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:51.955
This is one of those highly and
elaborately rhetorically

00:24:51.955 --> 00:24:56.238
ornamented passages.
So in Milton's argument against

00:24:56.238 --> 00:25:00.694
licensing, Milton explains the
importance of the coexistence --

00:25:00.694 --> 00:25:04.267
and it's very moving,
it's an argument for diversity

00:25:04.267 --> 00:25:07.532
-- the coexistence of so many
conflicting opinions and

00:25:07.532 --> 00:25:10.353
beliefs.
As I've suggested before,

00:25:10.353 --> 00:25:14.810
his more conservative
contemporaries were appalled by

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:20.125
the proliferation of religious
sects in mid-seventeenth-century

00:25:20.125 --> 00:25:22.936
England.
It would have been perfectly

00:25:22.936 --> 00:25:24.997
reasonable for them,
his opponents,

00:25:24.997 --> 00:25:28.754
to assume that only one set of
religious beliefs could actually

00:25:28.754 --> 00:25:31.620
represent the truth,
that there was only one

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.970
possible manifestation of divine
truth.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.848
One has roommates,
one has parents,

00:25:37.848 --> 00:25:43.438
in our own day and age,
who of course share such a

00:25:43.438 --> 00:25:49.369
belief in the absolute
singularity of the truth.

00:25:49.369 --> 00:25:52.266
Sometimes one has parents
[laughs]or roommates who not

00:25:52.266 --> 00:25:54.890
only believe that there is a
single truth but,

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.809
of course, that they are
themselves in possession of it.

00:25:57.809 --> 00:26:01.322
It's just this limited and,
for Milton, restrained,

00:26:01.322 --> 00:26:05.560
or constrained and reductive,
notion of a single truth that

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.616
he devotes so much of
Areopagitica to

00:26:08.616 --> 00:26:11.950
attacking.
So this is page 741: 

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:16.396
Truth indeed came once
into the world with her divine

00:26:16.396 --> 00:26:20.920
Master, and was a perfect shape
most glorious to look on.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.870
But when he ascended,
and his apostles after him were

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:29.579
laid asleep, then straight arose
a wicked race of deceivers,

00:26:29.579 --> 00:26:33.084
who, as that story goes of the
Egyptian Typhon with his

00:26:33.084 --> 00:26:35.746
conspirators,
how they dealt with the good

00:26:35.746 --> 00:26:38.333
Osiris,
[the wicked deceivers]

00:26:38.333 --> 00:26:42.591
took the virgin Truth,
hewed her lovely form into a

00:26:42.591 --> 00:26:46.082
thousand pieces,
and scattered them to the four

00:26:46.082 --> 00:26:48.513
winds.
From that time ever since,

00:26:48.513 --> 00:26:52.039
the sad friends of Truth,
such as durst appear,

00:26:52.039 --> 00:26:56.486
imitating the careful search
that Isis made for the mangled

00:26:56.486 --> 00:27:00.376
body of Osiris,
went up and down gathering up

00:27:00.376 --> 00:27:04.440
limb by limb still as they could
find them.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.472
I'll stop there.
With this utterly original

00:27:08.472 --> 00:27:12.700
fable about the fragmentation of
what we think of as religious

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.789
truth, Milton goes out of his
way -- this is remarkable.

00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:19.956
He's actually enacting,
and he's enacting it

00:27:19.956 --> 00:27:23.122
rhetorically,
the fragmentation of religious

00:27:23.122 --> 00:27:27.319
culture in seventeenth-century
England.One of the most

00:27:27.319 --> 00:27:31.590
intriguing aspects of this
amazing passage is the fact that

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:35.420
the fragmentation that Milton is
describing,

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:40.150
and on some level even
enacting, is something that he

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:44.327
seems to be celebrating here.
With the ascent of Christ,

00:27:44.327 --> 00:27:47.407
the lovely form of the virgin
Truth is hewed into a thousand

00:27:47.407 --> 00:27:49.599
pieces and scattered to the four
winds.

00:27:49.599 --> 00:27:53.293
The violence of this action,
of course, we can't deny,

00:27:53.293 --> 00:27:56.150
but it gets more complicated
than that.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:00.402
The Eyptian goddess Isis seeks
out the mangled body of her

00:28:00.402 --> 00:28:03.162
lover, Osiris,
because of her powerful

00:28:03.162 --> 00:28:07.937
affection for him and because of
her desire presumably to see him

00:28:07.937 --> 00:28:11.269
whole again.
There's also though,

00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:17.039
I think, a hint here that part
of the pleasure behind Isis'

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:22.710
search involves the process of
reassembling her lover,

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.708
the process of gathering him up
limb by limb -- the act of

00:28:26.708 --> 00:28:30.343
gathering.
Present participles in general

00:28:30.343 --> 00:28:35.929
in Areopagitica being
probably the most important form

00:28:35.929 --> 00:28:38.986
of speech,
the act of gathering him may be

00:28:38.986 --> 00:28:40.891
more pleasurable,
more desirable,

00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:43.750
than actually having him fully
reconstituted.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.210
It's likewise,
I think, part of our pleasure

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.699
in this crazy world of disparate
and confusing truths -- if we

00:28:49.699 --> 00:28:52.903
imagine ourselves in the
seventeenth century -- it's part

00:28:52.903 --> 00:28:55.460
of our pleasure to read,
to sort out,

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:59.309
and to reassemble the various
manifestations of truth.

00:28:59.309 --> 00:29:04.348
That's our common project here,
in fact, in an English

00:29:04.348 --> 00:29:07.738
department, say.
The sad friends of Truth in

00:29:07.738 --> 00:29:11.407
this fable have gone up and
down, gathering up Truth limb by

00:29:11.407 --> 00:29:13.770
limb still as they could find
them.

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:23.481
We have not yet found
them all, Lords and Commons,

00:29:23.481 --> 00:29:28.583
nor ever shall do,
till her Master's second

00:29:28.583 --> 00:29:31.779
coming.
He shall bring together every

00:29:31.779 --> 00:29:34.664
joint and member,
and shall mould them into an

00:29:34.664 --> 00:29:38.190
immortal feature of loveliness
and perfection.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.810
Surely these last two sentences
come as a surprise:

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.960
"we have not yet found them
all…

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.457
nor ever shall do."
We'll never find Truth in her

00:29:45.457 --> 00:29:47.974
entirety, at least not until the
Second Coming,

00:29:47.974 --> 00:29:49.890
and who knows when that will
be?

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:53.701
I think that for Milton,
in this passage the fact that

00:29:53.701 --> 00:29:56.289
we never shall do is just as
well,

00:29:56.289 --> 00:30:00.035
because it's the labor of
reading, it's the labor of

00:30:00.035 --> 00:30:03.559
researching, and it's the labor
of assemblage,

00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:09.529
rather than the actual finished
product, that motivates and

00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:14.470
spurs the Miltonic
individual.Milton wants us

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:21.470
to get us to feel the excitement
as we read a passage like this,

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.642
and the language that he uses
in this passage is itself a kind

00:30:25.642 --> 00:30:29.883
of demonstration of the pleasure
of the process of intellectual

00:30:29.883 --> 00:30:32.394
assemblage,
of intellectual collation,

00:30:32.394 --> 00:30:36.173
of various diverse ideas.
As readers, it's our duty,

00:30:36.173 --> 00:30:40.759
it's our obligation,
to sort out and to reassemble.

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:44.097
As we read this passage,
we sort out Christian myths

00:30:44.097 --> 00:30:47.303
from Egyptian myths,
or let's say we sort out from

00:30:47.303 --> 00:30:51.230
what with Milton be Christian
truth from Egyptian myths.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:54.846
The fact that they're put on
the same plane here suggests

00:30:54.846 --> 00:30:58.334
that both perhaps are either
truths or both perhaps are

00:30:58.334 --> 00:31:00.595
myths.
We sort out the similar

00:31:00.595 --> 00:31:04.390
confusion of gender roles,
which is truly remarkable,

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:07.856
as we balance the masculine
Christ with the feminine Truth

00:31:07.856 --> 00:31:11.079
with which the masculine Christ
is identified here.

00:31:11.079 --> 00:31:15.182
We have to balance the
mysteriously female Isis' search

00:31:15.182 --> 00:31:19.179
for her lover Osiris.
There are so many entities in

00:31:19.179 --> 00:31:23.677
this passage that seem to be
mysteriously conjoined in some

00:31:23.677 --> 00:31:28.925
kind of hermaphroditic unity.
We have to image the relation

00:31:28.925 --> 00:31:34.646
of the female Osiris with the
implicitly male reader's search

00:31:34.646 --> 00:31:39.509
for his lost lover,
which is the feminine Truth.

00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:42.117
Milton's infusing this passage
with a powerful sense of -- I

00:31:42.117 --> 00:31:46.861
don't know, what can we call it?
-- of gender nonconformity and

00:31:46.861 --> 00:31:51.034
cultural relativity.
Christianity emerges from this

00:31:51.034 --> 00:31:54.969
passage as just one truth out of
many, and it's almost as if we

00:31:54.969 --> 00:31:58.841
are being given our choice as
readers -- we're being given our

00:31:58.841 --> 00:32:02.460
choice of which set of myths is
the most attractive,

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.776
the most believable.
Maybe ultimately here,

00:32:05.776 --> 00:32:09.576
we're being given a choice as
to which set of myths is the

00:32:09.576 --> 00:32:12.116
most desirable.Now,
as I mentioned,

00:32:12.116 --> 00:32:15.180
the official purpose of the
tract is the political subject

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.488
of licensing.
Milton's responding to an

00:32:17.488 --> 00:32:19.980
immediate set of historical
circumstances.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.823
He wants to explain the
usefulness, the value,

00:32:22.823 --> 00:32:25.098
and, in fact,
the beauty of religious

00:32:25.098 --> 00:32:28.218
controversy;
but when you read an intensely

00:32:28.218 --> 00:32:32.154
poetic, highly ornamented
passage like the one that we've

00:32:32.154 --> 00:32:35.652
just looked at,
I think you can see why Milton

00:32:35.652 --> 00:32:39.224
was so interested in this
contemporary problem of

00:32:39.224 --> 00:32:42.349
religious diversity in the first
place.

00:32:42.349 --> 00:32:46.287
Contradictions and
inconsistencies in contemporary

00:32:46.287 --> 00:32:49.259
religious society are so much
like,

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:52.307
or at least look so much like,
the contradictions and

00:32:52.307 --> 00:32:55.530
inconsistencies that we find in
a work of literature,

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:58.631
that we find in a poem.
And Milton's defense of

00:32:58.631 --> 00:33:02.992
controversy seems in a lot of
ways continually to be slipping

00:33:02.992 --> 00:33:06.190
in to something like a defense
of poetry,

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:10.859
or certainly a defense of his
own poetic practice.

00:33:10.859 --> 00:33:15.177
One of the structural elements
that lends Areopagitica

00:33:15.177 --> 00:33:19.341
its curious power is a
carefully crafted network of

00:33:19.341 --> 00:33:23.890
images that Milton has employed
to structure the thing.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:28.353
I'm thinking particularly of
the images describing the

00:33:28.353 --> 00:33:33.405
activity of reading.One of
the central images here is the

00:33:33.405 --> 00:33:37.423
image of eating.
Reading is continually being

00:33:37.423 --> 00:33:41.089
described in terms of eating and
digestion.

00:33:41.089 --> 00:33:46.385
We have already encountered on
some level the importance of the

00:33:46.385 --> 00:33:50.730
figure of eating to John Milton.
Think of Comus.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:56.351
The lady's refusal to drink
of Comus' cup was just the first

00:33:56.351 --> 00:34:01.616
of Milton's attempts to bring
the action of ingestion to the

00:34:01.616 --> 00:34:06.673
very center of a literary work.
Paradise Lost will be

00:34:06.673 --> 00:34:09.159
filled with the activity of
eating.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:13.092
Milton devotes more than a few
lines -- and it's shocking -- to

00:34:13.092 --> 00:34:16.897
the process whereby the heavenly
angels not only eat food but

00:34:16.897 --> 00:34:20.354
they also digest it;
and Milton lets us know,

00:34:20.354 --> 00:34:24.867
whether we want to know or not,
how those angels actually

00:34:24.867 --> 00:34:28.010
excrete the food they have taken
in.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.697
But the most central act of
eating, of course,

00:34:30.697 --> 00:34:33.922
in Milton's great epic
obviously has nothing to do with

00:34:33.922 --> 00:34:35.820
angels.
It's the eating of the

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:39.290
forbidden fruit by Adam and Eve.
It's because this action of

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:42.987
eating is so absolutely central
to the plot of Paradise Lost

00:34:42.987 --> 00:34:46.684
that we are obliged to spend
-- let's spend the rest of our

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:50.679
time here focusing on Milton's
consideration in this treatise,

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:54.884
in the Areopagitica of
1644, of the problem that we

00:34:54.884 --> 00:34:59.384
will find haunting Paradise
Lost: the problem of

00:34:59.384 --> 00:35:03.928
the eating of the fruit,
and the problem of God's

00:35:03.928 --> 00:35:10.228
prohibition -- God's censorship
-- of the fruit of the tree of

00:35:10.228 --> 00:35:15.050
the knowledge of good and evil.
God's licensing?

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:21.719
We'll see.Turn to page 727.
This is the left-hand column.

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:27.349
Milton's quoting Dionysius
Alexandrinus in this passage.

00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:30.678
He tells us that Dionysius
Alexandrinus wrote,

00:35:30.678 --> 00:35:34.079
"'Read any books whatever come
to thy hands,

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:38.566
for thou art sufficient both to
judge aright and to examine each

00:35:38.566 --> 00:35:41.601
matter.'"
Dionysius compares this command

00:35:41.601 --> 00:35:45.231
to read everything,
to read everything you possibly

00:35:45.231 --> 00:35:47.438
can,
to Saint Paul's command in the

00:35:47.438 --> 00:35:50.780
Epistle to the Thessalonians,
which is: "Prove all things.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.639
Hold fast to that which is
good."

00:35:53.639 --> 00:35:58.039
Prove here means "to
test, to try all things."

00:35:58.039 --> 00:36:00.881
Paul's making a claim here for
the individual's -- this is

00:36:00.881 --> 00:36:03.772
certainly how Milton was able to
read it -- a claim for the

00:36:03.772 --> 00:36:06.912
individual's capacity to make a
moral judgment after some period

00:36:06.912 --> 00:36:09.545
of trial,
or after some period of

00:36:09.545 --> 00:36:13.797
experimentation.
Milton elaborates on this claim

00:36:13.797 --> 00:36:18.036
that we should read and prove
anything we want,

00:36:18.036 --> 00:36:24.119
for we are sufficient to judge
aright.He's moving on here:

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:27.816
…
[H]e might have added [Milton

00:36:27.816 --> 00:36:30.996
tells us]
another remarkable saying of

00:36:30.996 --> 00:36:33.489
the same author:
"To the pure,

00:36:33.489 --> 00:36:37.265
all things are pure";
not only meats and drinks,

00:36:37.265 --> 00:36:40.119
but all kind of knowledge
whether of good or evil;

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:44.703
the knowledge cannot defile,
nor consequently the books,

00:36:44.703 --> 00:36:48.369
if the will and conscience be
not defiled.

00:36:48.369 --> 00:36:50.855
For books are as meat and
viands are -- some of good,

00:36:50.855 --> 00:36:52.803
some of evil substance,
and yet God,

00:36:52.803 --> 00:36:56.005
in that unapocryphal vision,
said without exception,

00:36:56.005 --> 00:36:59.226
"Rise, Peter,
kill and eat," leaving the

00:36:59.226 --> 00:37:02.550
choice to each man's
discretion.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.883
We should be able to read
whatever we want,

00:37:05.883 --> 00:37:10.010
just as we should be able to
eat whatever we want.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:14.173
Milton's language -- the image
here is of this [laughs]-- it's

00:37:14.173 --> 00:37:17.860
kind of a combined gastronomic
and literary freedom.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.759
This is the freedom of the
smorgasbord,

00:37:20.759 --> 00:37:23.530
of the public
library/smorgasbord,

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.851
or Atticus [bookstore and
café]

00:37:25.851 --> 00:37:28.675
for that matter,
a place where you can eat and

00:37:28.675 --> 00:37:31.750
read -- although not in the same
-- actually,

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.770
[laughs]they don't let you eat
around the books.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:39.704
You get my point though.
We should be able to try all

00:37:39.704 --> 00:37:43.940
things, to prove all things,
and then decide whether or not

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.159
we actually like it,
whether it brings us some sort

00:37:47.159 --> 00:37:49.746
of pleasure or wisdom.
This array of choices is more

00:37:49.746 --> 00:37:53.986
than just a luxury for Milton.
It's absolutely constitutive of

00:37:53.986 --> 00:37:57.340
the ideal of freedom,
of our freedom;

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.914
because if we don't try
everything, if we don't give

00:37:59.914 --> 00:38:02.489
ourselves an opportunity to
decide for ourselves,

00:38:02.489 --> 00:38:05.991
then, of course,
someone will invariably be

00:38:05.991 --> 00:38:10.827
making those decisions for
us.It shouldn't be difficult

00:38:10.827 --> 00:38:15.996
to see a kind of problem that is
beginning to arise in Milton's

00:38:15.996 --> 00:38:19.216
text here.
I suggested just a minute ago

00:38:19.216 --> 00:38:23.054
that one of the relevant stories
that is always lying behind

00:38:23.054 --> 00:38:26.696
Milton's discussion of human
choice is the story from the

00:38:26.696 --> 00:38:30.143
Book of Genesis about Adam and
Eve's choice to eat the

00:38:30.143 --> 00:38:33.247
forbidden fruit.
And so much of Areopagitica

00:38:33.247 --> 00:38:36.409
involves Milton's bringing
together competing images and

00:38:36.409 --> 00:38:39.312
traditions and arguments.
As we've already seen,

00:38:39.312 --> 00:38:42.690
he interweaves Christian
figures with pagan figures.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:47.773
He positions pro-censorship
argument alongside

00:38:47.773 --> 00:38:52.179
anti-censorship rhetoric or
metaphor,

00:38:52.179 --> 00:38:55.552
and there are dozens of moments
in which it's just these

00:38:55.552 --> 00:38:58.986
opposites that are being asked
to coexist in some kind of

00:38:58.986 --> 00:39:01.288
peace.
But nowhere in Areopagitica

00:39:01.288 --> 00:39:04.440
do the conflicts seem so
pronounced, or so painful,

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:09.152
or make us wince so much as the
tension that arises between the

00:39:09.152 --> 00:39:13.559
Genesis story of Adam and Eve --
God knows why Milton feels

00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:18.423
compelled to bring this story up
-- the tension between the story

00:39:18.423 --> 00:39:22.983
of Adam and Eve and Milton's own
impassioned argument against

00:39:22.983 --> 00:39:26.099
licensing.As I've just
noted,

00:39:26.099 --> 00:39:29.825
Milton quotes Paul's dictum
that "to the pure,

00:39:29.825 --> 00:39:32.630
all things are pure."
If you're pure,

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:35.809
not only are meats and viands
pure (meats and drinks),

00:39:35.809 --> 00:39:39.170
but all kinds of knowledge,
whether of good and evil.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:42.578
You just have to extend for a
little bit this Pauline

00:39:42.578 --> 00:39:46.380
philosophy of freedom to the
situation of the unfallen Eden

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.002
of Adam and Eve to see a kind of
[laughs]

00:39:49.002 --> 00:39:52.869
logical trouble that Milton is
getting himself in to.

00:39:52.869 --> 00:39:57.115
The Genesis story of God's
peremptory prohibition of the

00:39:57.115 --> 00:40:01.361
fruit from the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil is

00:40:01.361 --> 00:40:05.839
the strongest analogy that I can
think of to the licenser's

00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:08.849
peremptory prohibition of a
book.

00:40:08.849 --> 00:40:13.989
Obviously, Milton isn't able to
make this analogy explicit.

00:40:13.989 --> 00:40:16.744
It would completely dash any
logical sense that

00:40:16.744 --> 00:40:18.900
Areopagitica still
retains.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:24.739
It's nonetheless always there,
this tension.

00:40:24.739 --> 00:40:28.250
God's forbidding of the fruit
removes from Adam and Eve any

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.489
capacity for choosing and
deciding,

00:40:30.489 --> 00:40:35.059
and you can see Milton worrying
in Areopagitica about the

00:40:35.059 --> 00:40:39.556
uneasy relationship of his own
argument to this central text in

00:40:39.556 --> 00:40:43.232
divine scripture.
So look at page 728 in the

00:40:43.232 --> 00:40:47.039
Hughes. This is the
left-hand column:

00:40:47.039 --> 00:40:51.149
Good and evil we know in
the field of this world grow up

00:40:51.149 --> 00:40:54.884
together almost inseparably;
and the knowledge of good is so

00:40:54.884 --> 00:40:57.760
involved and interwoven with the
knowledge of evil,

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.221
and in so many cunning
resemblances hardly to be

00:41:01.221 --> 00:41:05.419
discerned, that those confused
seeds which were imposed on

00:41:05.419 --> 00:41:10.060
Psyche as an incessant labour to
cull out and sort asunder,

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:14.799
were not more intermixed.
It was from out the rind of one

00:41:14.799 --> 00:41:17.879
apple tasted,
that the knowledge of good and

00:41:17.879 --> 00:41:22.032
evil, as two twins cleaving
together, leaped forth into the

00:41:22.032 --> 00:41:25.413
world.
And perhaps this is that doom

00:41:25.413 --> 00:41:29.437
which Adam fell into of knowing
good and evil,

00:41:29.437 --> 00:41:33.820
that is to say,
of knowing good by evil.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:37.980
There are so many things to say
about this passage.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:41.179
One thing that I'll just throw
out now is that it's a

00:41:41.179 --> 00:41:44.255
remarkable description of the
modern world of moral

00:41:44.255 --> 00:41:47.025
uncertainty.
Like Isis, whom we saw piecing

00:41:47.025 --> 00:41:50.239
together the body of Osiris,
or like the sad friends of

00:41:50.239 --> 00:41:53.809
Truth picking up the torn limbs
of that beautiful virgin,

00:41:53.809 --> 00:41:58.185
we are left to cull out and
sort asunder the confused seeds

00:41:58.185 --> 00:42:02.409
of good and evil.Now on one
level of this passage,

00:42:02.409 --> 00:42:06.723
Milton's describing this modern
condition as the product of the

00:42:06.723 --> 00:42:08.820
Fall.
It's too bad that we live in

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.225
this world.
This is the doom which Adam

00:42:11.225 --> 00:42:14.846
fell into, this is the fallen
condition to which we've all

00:42:14.846 --> 00:42:17.955
been consigned;
but the passage is so much more

00:42:17.955 --> 00:42:21.760
complicated than that because
good and evil seem to have been

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.360
mixed up in the apple before the
Fall.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.579
There was good in that
forbidden fruit as well as evil.

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:32.285
This is that doom which Adam
fell into: of knowing good and

00:42:32.285 --> 00:42:35.480
evil -- that is to say,
of knowing good by evil.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:40.445
Adam at the Fall didn't simply
come into a knowledge primarily

00:42:40.445 --> 00:42:43.866
of evil.
Adam, by tasting the apple,

00:42:43.866 --> 00:42:49.466
came into a knowledge of good,
and he was only able to know

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:54.777
this good by means of the
experience of the knowledge of

00:42:54.777 --> 00:42:59.991
evil.There are a lot of
perspectives discernible or

00:42:59.991 --> 00:43:04.681
extractable from this treatise,
Areopagitica,

00:43:04.681 --> 00:43:08.065
from which the fallen state
seems in so many ways,

00:43:08.065 --> 00:43:13.011
maybe in every way,
superior to its unfallen

00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:18.485
counterpart.
We will see Milton returning to

00:43:18.485 --> 00:43:23.989
all of these questions in
Paradise Lost.

00:43:23.989 --> 00:43:27.749
We will even see Milton place
in the mouth of Eve the next

00:43:27.749 --> 00:43:32.027
sentence in this passage,
or at least a paraphrased and,

00:43:32.027 --> 00:43:35.940
of course, versified version of
this sentence.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:42.608
This is when Milton tells us: 
I cannot praise a

00:43:42.608 --> 00:43:51.110
fugitive and cloistered virtue,
unexercised and unbreathed,

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:54.002
that never sallies out and sees
her adversary,

00:43:54.002 --> 00:43:57.602
but slinks out of the race
where that immortal garland is

00:43:57.602 --> 00:44:01.920
to be run for,
not without dust and heat.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.607
You'll find Eve in Book Nine of
Paradise Lost voicing

00:44:05.607 --> 00:44:09.357
essentially this same sentiment
when she's explaining to Adam

00:44:09.357 --> 00:44:11.670
why she needs to work
separately.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:13.661
This is the argument that
really, of course,

00:44:13.661 --> 00:44:15.559
puts her at risk of Satan's
temptation.

00:44:15.559 --> 00:44:19.369
To so many readers it has
seemed that Eve is actually

00:44:19.369 --> 00:44:22.300
quoting Milton's much earlier
writing,

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.535
Areopagitica,
in her defense,

00:44:24.535 --> 00:44:27.410
and it has an incredibly
unsettling effect.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:31.219
Evil has to be challenged.
It has to be confronted.

00:44:31.219 --> 00:44:34.940
It has to be tasted before it
can be conquered.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:38.420
It can't simply be avoided.
This is Eve's and

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:42.333
Areopagitica's argument.
We will never be virtuous

00:44:42.333 --> 00:44:45.707
simply because we cloistered
ourselves or segregated

00:44:45.707 --> 00:44:50.469
ourselves from any temptation.
Virtue is to be fought for and

00:44:50.469 --> 00:44:55.543
raced for, not without dust and
heat.Let me conclude the

00:44:55.543 --> 00:45:00.702
lecture by saying that it's a
startling experience and I hope

00:45:00.702 --> 00:45:06.119
you feel some of the surprise
moving from Areopagitica,

00:45:06.119 --> 00:45:09.952
which has to be Milton's
most important and consequential

00:45:09.952 --> 00:45:13.530
work in prose -- moving from
that to Paradise Lost,

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.310
which is,
of course, Milton's most

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:18.470
important work of poetry.
We'll be doing this in one

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:21.835
week, and the disjunction
between the two works,

00:45:21.835 --> 00:45:26.057
this disjunction at least with
respect to their treatment of

00:45:26.057 --> 00:45:29.028
the Fall,
should dramatize the nature,

00:45:29.028 --> 00:45:32.333
or just the enormity,
of a lot of the conceptual

00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:36.199
problems and conflicts that
Milton is tackling here.

00:45:36.199 --> 00:45:39.571
As a faithful Christian,
of course -- and I'm not going

00:45:39.571 --> 00:45:42.630
to try to deny this -- as a
faithful Christian,

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:46.751
Milton believes that the Fall
is only to be lamented and that

00:45:46.751 --> 00:45:49.980
Adam and Eve should not have
eaten the apple.

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:53.601
As a believing Christian,
Milton believes that the

00:45:53.601 --> 00:45:57.591
omnipotent God had every right
to license, to prohibit,

00:45:57.591 --> 00:46:01.806
that apple;
but it's a measure that we have

00:46:01.806 --> 00:46:05.781
to take seriously.
It's a measure of Milton's

00:46:05.781 --> 00:46:10.562
ambition and his intellectual
courage that enables him to set

00:46:10.562 --> 00:46:15.263
out to justify a God who can
inflict upon his creatures such

00:46:15.263 --> 00:46:18.769
a seemingly arbitrary act of
licensing.

00:46:18.769 --> 00:46:21.916
The extent to which Milton
succeeds in justifying such a

00:46:21.916 --> 00:46:24.090
God in Paradise Lost will
be,

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:27.701
of course, one of the questions
that we will be exploring over

00:46:27.701 --> 00:46:30.743
the next couple of weeks.
So you will read for

00:46:30.743 --> 00:46:35.000
Wednesday's class the first two
books of Paradise Lost.

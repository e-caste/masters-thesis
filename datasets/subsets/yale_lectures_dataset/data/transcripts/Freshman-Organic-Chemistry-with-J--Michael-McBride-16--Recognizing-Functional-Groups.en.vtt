00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.150
Prof: So this is where
we were at the end last time,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:09.070
trying to decide when a high
HOMO, or a low LUMO,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.059
is unusual in its energy;
because, as the world is,

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.320
things like to be at low
energy.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.120
We'll talk about that later,
why that's so.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.560
But that means that electrons
tend to be in the occupied,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.754
the low -- occupy the
low-energy orbitals and not the

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:28.290
high-energy orbitals.
 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.814
So that empty orbitals are
almost always higher than any

00:00:32.814 --> 00:00:34.460
occupied orbitals.
 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.370
So if you want to get good
energy match,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.690
and therefore mixing,
and therefore bonding,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.019
the occupied orbital that
you're interested in must be

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.230
unusually high,
and the vacant orbital must be

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.270
unusually low.
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.737
So the task we have is to
recognize what orbitals should

00:00:55.737 --> 00:01:00.530
be unusually high and what ones
should be unusually low,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.560
and if we can find the unusual
ones,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.453
then we'll know what's
reactive, be able to identify

00:01:07.453 --> 00:01:08.980
functional groups.
 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.980
Okay, so unusual,
compared to what?

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.468
Compared to normal occupied and
vacant orbitals.

00:01:15.468 --> 00:01:19.745
That is, in organic chemistry,
or in most kinds of chemistry

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:23.295
actually, carbon-carbon,
carbon-hydrogen bonds are

00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:26.406
occupied orbitals;
not unusually high,

00:01:26.406 --> 00:01:28.879
they're our standard of usual.
 

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:32.955
And the antibonds,
corresponding antibonds are

00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:36.849
unusual -- are the usual vacant
orbitals.

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:40.989
So what can make things
unusually low or unusually high?

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:43.269
When the valence-shell orbitals
that,

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.560
if they bonded,
would go down and up,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.080
don't bond with anything,
don't mix with anything,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.970
then they'll be unusual.
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.251
Second, if the orbitals don't
overlap, then they don't go down

00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:57.290
and go up.
 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.218
Third, if you have an unusual
atomic orbital.

00:02:00.218 --> 00:02:02.900
These are made of carbon and
hydrogen, going down.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.930
But if you start with something
that's unusual,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.616
unusually high or unusually
low, then the things that come

00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:11.849
from it will be unusually high
or unusually low.

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.610
And finally, electrical charge.
 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.691
So right at the end last time
we were looking at the first

00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:22.199
example: unmixed valence-shell
atomic orbitals.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:26.086
So we saw that the simplest of
all acids, H^+,

00:02:26.086 --> 00:02:29.973
of course is unusually -- if it
were occupied,

00:02:29.973 --> 00:02:34.293
it would be unusually high for
an occupied orbital.

00:02:34.293 --> 00:02:35.330
Right?
 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.050
Because it hasn't gone down.
 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.972
But it's vacant,
and it's unusually low,

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:43.720
for a vacant orbital,
because it hasn't gone up.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.410
And so on with these others:
an unshared pair on nitrogen;

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.030
or a little less so on oxygen.
 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.032
A vacant orbital on boron
that's not bonding with anything

00:02:54.032 --> 00:02:57.735
is an unusually low LUMO;
even though orbitals on boron

00:02:57.735 --> 00:03:01.168
are not unusually low,
because the nuclear charge

00:03:01.168 --> 00:03:05.270
isn't very big for something
that's using the second,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.389
n=2, quantum level
orbitals,

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.688
valence orbitals.
 

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:13.199
It's an unusually low nuclear
charge for that.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:17.534
So the orbitals are unusually
high in energy,

00:03:17.534 --> 00:03:21.280
not being attracted by more
protons.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.445
But it's low for a vacant
orbital, if it hasn't mixed with

00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:26.250
anything.
 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.324
Okay, and finally notice that
some of these are charged:

00:03:30.324 --> 00:03:33.531
H^+;
plus means that's a good place

00:03:33.531 --> 00:03:37.030
to put an electron,
so unusually low;

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.240
OH^-, unusually high because of
the negative charge;

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.889
CH_3^-, especially high.
 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.340
So this slide also shows the
fourth point,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.884
that electrical charge makes a
difference on how normal

00:03:51.884 --> 00:03:55.000
occupied and vacant orbitals
are.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.099
Okay, so these unusually low
vacant orbitals are acids,

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.139
like H^+.
 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.925
Unusually high occupied
orbitals are bases,

00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:07.438
like OH^-, as we just showed on
the previous slide.

00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:11.860
That means that you can mix the
high HOMO of OH^-,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.658
with the low LUMO of H^+,
and two electrons,

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:19.180
the ones that were on the OH^-,
go down in energy,

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.250
and that makes a bond.
 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.095
And our notation for showing
that is to draw a curved arrow,

00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:27.819
and it gives water.
 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.910
Now think carefully about what
a curved arrow means;

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.829
it's not the same as a straight
arrow.

00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:38.680
A curved arrow designates a
shift of electron pairs.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.699
It doesn't show that this atom
moves from here to here.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.100
It shows that a pair of
electrons shifts,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.199
and that pair of electrons goes
from being on the oxygen,

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.940
to being between oxygen and
hydrogen,

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.490
to form the bond.
 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.603
So you start the curved arrow
where the electron pair is at

00:04:58.603 --> 00:05:01.014
the beginning,
and you end the arrow,

00:05:01.014 --> 00:05:03.668
put its point,
where it's going to be in the

00:05:03.668 --> 00:05:04.158
product.
 

00:05:04.158 --> 00:05:04.649
Right?
 

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:07.509
So it's not showing that an
atom moves from here to there.

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.055
It's showing that the electrons
that were formerly on oxygen are

00:05:12.055 --> 00:05:14.509
now between oxygen and hydrogen.
 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.435
The effect of that is,
of course, to pull all the

00:05:17.435 --> 00:05:18.959
hydrogen to the oxygen.
 

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:20.819
But that's not what's being
shown by the arrow.

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:25.521
What's being shown by the arrow
is how the electrons are moving

00:05:25.521 --> 00:05:26.810
in our picture.
 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.420
Okay, so there's a case.
 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.271
Now here's another base with
the same acid,

00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:34.937
and we can draw a curved arrow
there and show making an

00:05:34.937 --> 00:05:37.110
ammonium ion out of ammonia.
 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.589
Or we could use the same base
with a different acid,

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:45.639
the low vacant orbital of BH_3,
and draw the same curved arrow,

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.639
and make this anion,
make the boron-oxygen bond.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.750
Or we could start with
completely different ones.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.442
We could start with ammonia,
not OH^-, not Arrhenius's base,

00:05:58.442 --> 00:06:02.029
but ammonia;
not Arrhenius acid,

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.610
H^+, but BH_3.
 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.569
But it's exactly the same
reaction.

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:10.050
The high HOMO mixes with the
low LUMO to form a new bond.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.170
Okay?
 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.692
So that's what curved arrows
show, and don't confuse it by

00:06:13.692 --> 00:06:16.163
trying to draw molecules or
atoms moving,

00:06:16.163 --> 00:06:18.079
and showing a curved arrow.
 

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:19.903
If you want to show them
moving, draw some other kind of

00:06:19.903 --> 00:06:21.456
arrow;
draw dotted arrows or a

00:06:21.456 --> 00:06:24.139
straight arrow or a wiggly
arrow, or something.

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:31.680
But the curved arrows have a
very specific meaning.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.889
Now the second reason that
things could be unusually high

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.699
or low is because they don't
have much overlap.

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:40.600
Notice in the first case,
it was just an extreme case of

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.970
that.
 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.930
There was no overlap at all,
the orbitals were just there.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.069
But even though the orbitals
are mixed with something else,

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:51.670
if the overlap is poor,
they haven't changed very much,

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.375
they still look very much like
they did originally.

00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:54.810
Right?
 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.076
So a good example of not having
very good overlap is the

00:06:59.076 --> 00:07:02.490
side-to-side overlap of p
orbitals.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.365
The π overlap -- you
remember from looking at those

00:07:05.365 --> 00:07:08.050
curves of amount of overlap for
different orbitals versus

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.189
distance --
the π overlap isn't

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.680
very big.
 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:19.733
So even though the p
orbitals start a little higher

00:07:19.733 --> 00:07:25.769
on carbon than they do on
hydrogen,

00:07:25.769 --> 00:07:30.050
or normal bonds of carbon that
have s character in them,

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.557
they start a little higher,
but they don't mix very much.

00:07:33.557 --> 00:07:34.060
Right?
 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.269
So the π orbital is
unusually high,

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:42.178
and the π*
antibonding orbital is unusually

00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:44.956
low,
because they didn't go down or

00:07:44.956 --> 00:07:46.069
up very much.
 

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:46.769
Okay?
 

00:07:46.769 --> 00:07:51.283
Now, which of those do you
think is more remarkable,

00:07:51.283 --> 00:07:53.850
in its highness or lowness?
 

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:58.639
So for this reason,
the carbon-carbon double bond

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:02.930
could behave either as an acid
or as a base.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.930
Right?
 

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.569
High occupied orbital makes it
a base;

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.040
low vacant orbital makes it an
acid.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.300
And indeed, it does have both
kinds of reactivity.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.879
But which do you think is more
pronounced?

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:21.475
Which would be more familiar,
how high the occupied one is,

00:08:21.475 --> 00:08:25.000
or how low the vacant one is?
 

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.170
Lucas, what do you say?
 

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.079
Student:  How low the
vacant one is.

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:28.819
Prof: And why do you say
so?

00:08:28.819 --> 00:08:31.732
Student:  Because
electrons have to sort of --

00:08:31.732 --> 00:08:35.037
they would likely move into a
position of an energy as close

00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:36.269
as possible to it.
 

00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:38.008
Prof: Yes,
but on the other hand,

00:08:38.008 --> 00:08:40.192
the electrons of the
π want to move into

00:08:40.192 --> 00:08:41.038
something else.
 

00:08:41.038 --> 00:08:44.173
Student:  There are lots
and lots and lots of electrons

00:08:44.173 --> 00:08:44.740
going up.
 

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.258
Prof: Well there are
lots -- there are even more

00:08:47.258 --> 00:08:49.123
vacant orbitals than there are
electrons.

00:08:49.123 --> 00:08:49.590
Right?
 

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.552
Student:  Because you
also have starring electrons

00:08:52.552 --> 00:08:54.879
that will -- like in a normal
carbon atom.

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:58.549
Prof: Let's just look at
the picture.

00:08:58.549 --> 00:09:00.149
Yes Catherine?
 

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:03.033
Student:  I think the
HOMO is more unusual because

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:04.990
it's farther away from the usual
--

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.524
Prof: Ah,
the HOMO is further above the

00:09:08.524 --> 00:09:11.590
normal bonds,
than the LUMO is below the

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.240
normal antibonds.
 

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.490
Why?
 

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.090
Student:  Because the
p orbital started --

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.288
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:09:18.288 --> 00:09:19.500
Student:  Because the
p orbital started a

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:19.860
little higher.
 

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.227
Prof: Ah,
because they started a little

00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:22.596
higher.
 

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:23.070
Right?
 

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.710
So most reactions that we'll
study,

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.077
or at least many reactions that
we'll study of the carbon-carbon

00:09:29.077 --> 00:09:31.586
double bond,
it's reactive because of the

00:09:31.586 --> 00:09:33.639
high HOMO,
not because of the low LUMO;

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:37.168
although there are cases where
the low LUMO makes it reactive.

00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:40.390
But it's this π
orbital, here,

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:45.182
that makes it particularly
remarkable, because they started

00:09:45.182 --> 00:09:46.668
a little high.
 

00:09:46.668 --> 00:09:49.870
Okay, so the high HOMO makes it
unusually reactive.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.413
Now how about the C=O double
bond?

00:09:52.413 --> 00:09:53.029
Right?
 

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:56.879
So it starts with the same
p orbital on the carbon,

00:09:56.879 --> 00:10:00.350
which has π overlap
and therefore not much shifting

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.461
up and down,
with a p orbital of

00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:05.090
oxygen, which of course is lower
than that of carbon,

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.639
because of the higher nuclear
charge.

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:11.230
Which of these will be most
unusual?

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:16.678
Somebody got a suggestion?
 

00:10:16.678 --> 00:10:20.136
So what would you think the
characteristic reactivity of a

00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:25.135
C=O double bond --
would it be reactive mostly as

00:10:25.135 --> 00:10:29.644
a high HOMO --
that is, as a base -- or mostly

00:10:29.644 --> 00:10:30.908
as a low LUMO?
 

00:10:30.908 --> 00:10:35.460
Which is more unusual,
compared with what we compare

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.710
things with?
 

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:37.620
Andrew?
 

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.590
Student:  I think it's a
low LUMO.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:39.168
Prof: Why?
 

00:10:39.168 --> 00:10:42.070
Student:  First of all
it can't -- it's further away

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:42.970
from its origin.
 

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.655
Prof: And why is it
further down,

00:10:44.655 --> 00:10:46.298
compared to what we usually
compare?

00:10:46.298 --> 00:10:50.538
Why does the π*,
C double bond O,

00:10:50.538 --> 00:10:53.970
why is that orbital so very
low?

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.436
Pardon me, one reason it's low
is because the overlap isn't

00:10:58.436 --> 00:10:59.360
very much.
 

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.504
So it didn't go up so much.
 

00:11:01.504 --> 00:11:02.058
Right?
 

00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:04.278
That's the same,
true with a C-C double bond.

00:11:04.278 --> 00:11:06.980
But what's special about the
C-O double bond Andrew?

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.826
Student:  I thought the
atoms are different,

00:11:08.826 --> 00:11:11.638
there's a --
Prof: Because of the bad

00:11:11.638 --> 00:11:14.769
energy match,
it didn't go up very much from

00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:18.340
the carbon, or down very much
from the oxygen.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.940
But the average is low,
that it starts from.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:27.142
So what's special here is the
π is not so unusual,

00:11:27.142 --> 00:11:29.168
not so far from here.
 

00:11:29.168 --> 00:11:30.817
But this one,
π*,

00:11:30.817 --> 00:11:32.340
is very far from here.
 

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.522
So what should make a carbonyl
especially reactive is its low

00:11:37.522 --> 00:11:41.149
vacant orbital,
because of poor overlap;

00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:46.355
and that it started with an
oxygen, an unusually low

00:11:46.355 --> 00:11:49.009
orbital, atomic orbital.
 

00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:50.610
Okay?
 

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.759
We saw another example here.
 

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:57.504
The three-membered carbon ring
is unusually reactive,

00:11:57.504 --> 00:11:59.970
for a carbon-carbon bond.
 

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:04.231
That is, the electrons in that
carbon-carbon bond are not

00:12:04.231 --> 00:12:09.004
shifted down so much,
and the antibond is not shifted

00:12:09.004 --> 00:12:11.839
up so much,
as in normal carbon-carbon

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:12.269
bonds.
 

00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:14.918
Why?
 

00:12:14.918 --> 00:12:18.529
What's special about the bonds
in the three-membered ring?

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:19.918
Kevin?
 

00:12:19.918 --> 00:12:23.409
Student:  Well two of
them are bent.

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:24.330
Prof: Ah, they're bent.
 

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.220
And what does that mean?
 

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.820
Student:  Greater than
90°.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.999
Prof: Yes,
but they're bent,

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:30.639
so what?
 

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:31.990
Student:  It overlaps,
there are better overlaps.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:33.408
Prof: Does it overlap as
well?

00:12:33.408 --> 00:12:35.267
So it doesn't go up and down as
much.

00:12:35.267 --> 00:12:35.678
Right?
 

00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:40.129
So another example of poor
overlap.

00:12:40.129 --> 00:12:44.154
Okay, or you could have an
unusual atomic energy orbital in

00:12:44.154 --> 00:12:45.820
the molecular orbital.
 

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.385
For example,
how about a C-F single bond?

00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:50.100
Right?
 

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.100
So the overlap can be perfectly
good.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.688
It's a regular old
σ bond,

00:12:54.688 --> 00:12:55.505
straight on.
 

00:12:55.505 --> 00:12:56.120
Right?
 

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.110
But the fluorine starts very
low.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.928
There's bad energy match.
 

00:13:01.928 --> 00:13:06.513
So the π* isn't so
very different from a vacant

00:13:06.513 --> 00:13:10.222
orbital on carbon;
unusually low as a vacant

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:10.970
orbital.
 

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.330
So it should act as an acid.
 

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.875
Things that have high HOMOs
should come up and react with

00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:20.309
that σ* of C-F.
 

00:13:20.309 --> 00:13:22.720
It's an unusually low LUMO.
 

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.038
Can you think of what the flip
side of that --

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:26.269
how could you have something
like this,

00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:31.190
a carbon bonding to something,
that for the same or analogous

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.700
reason would have an unusually
high occupied orbital?

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:40.409
What would you want the carbon
to bond with?

00:13:40.409 --> 00:13:42.919
Choose an element.
 

00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:43.759
Student:  Lithium.
 

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:45.129
Prof: Lithium.
 

00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:46.220
Why lithium?
 

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:51.620
Student:  Because --
Prof: Because you looked

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.210
at the PowerPoint?
 

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.110
Student:  No.
 

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.610
Prof:
&gt;

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:55.139
Student:  I didn't look
at it.

00:13:55.139 --> 00:13:56.480
Prof: Why lithium?
 

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:04.317
Student:  Because its
valence electron -- it's easy

00:14:04.317 --> 00:14:10.370
for the valence electron to be
given away.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.788
Prof: Why?
 

00:14:11.788 --> 00:14:14.666
Student:  Because it
would be as stable as a lithium

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:15.409
plus one ion.
 

00:14:15.409 --> 00:14:17.759
Prof: Why?
 

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:22.190
That's restating the same
thing, right?

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:29.399
What's different about lithium?
 

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:34.374
Why are orbitals on lithium,
as an atom, unusually high in

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:37.690
energy, compared to
carbon-hydrogen?

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:38.798
Catherine?
 

00:14:38.798 --> 00:14:40.580
Student:  Because it has
a low nuclear charge.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.868
Prof: Because it has a
low nuclear charge.

00:14:42.868 --> 00:14:43.250
Right?
 

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.610
It's right at the left end of
the table.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:47.269
Okay?
 

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:51.042
So its orbitals aren't very
stable because it doesn't have

00:14:51.042 --> 00:14:52.830
very high nuclear charge.
 

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:53.990
So it's a high energy.
 

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.720
And therefore it has bad energy
match.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.408
Or it could've been lithium
that I drew here.

00:14:59.408 --> 00:15:02.500
I happened to draw boron,
which is, for the same reason,

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.580
a lower nuclear charge than
carbon;

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.340
therefore higher energy as an
atomic orbital.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.793
When they mix,
what's special here is the

00:15:11.793 --> 00:15:14.556
occupied orbital,
σ,

00:15:14.556 --> 00:15:18.960
which is unusually high,
because the average started

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.909
high.
 

00:15:19.909 --> 00:15:21.080
Okay.
 

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.408
So boron.
 

00:15:24.408 --> 00:15:28.371
You may remember that in the
first slide we showed,

00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:32.960
boron had a vacant orbital;
that p orbital on boron

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.799
is vacant.
 

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:35.509
Unusually low.
 

00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:40.210
Therefore what, acid or base?
 

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.110
Unusually low vacant orbitals,
which does that make it?

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.840
Student:  Acid.
 

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.370
Prof: Acid.
 

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.504
So BH_3 should be an acid.
 

00:15:48.504 --> 00:15:49.350
Right?
 

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.669
Well what I just showed you is
what Shai?

00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:54.418
On the previous slide;
we'll go back there.

00:15:54.418 --> 00:15:55.379
Student:  That it had a
big B-H;

00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:56.139
yes the B-H.
 

00:15:56.139 --> 00:15:57.845
Prof: It has an
unusually high HOMO,

00:15:57.845 --> 00:15:58.129
BH_3.
 

00:15:58.129 --> 00:16:01.558
So what does that make it Shai?
 

00:16:01.558 --> 00:16:03.490
Student:  It would make
it a base but --

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.590
Prof: So is it an acid
or a base?

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.460
Student:  Both.
 

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.980
Prof: Wilson?
 

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:10.600
Student:  Both.
 

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.379
Prof: It's both.
 

00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:19.621
And what does that suggest,
if the same molecule is both an

00:16:19.621 --> 00:16:21.870
acid and a base?
 

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.490
What do acids react with?
 

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.778
Students:  Bases.
 

00:16:25.778 --> 00:16:28.282
Prof: So what if the
same molecule is an acid and a

00:16:28.282 --> 00:16:28.590
base?
 

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.908
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:16:29.908 --> 00:16:31.678
Prof: It's going to
react with itself.

00:16:31.678 --> 00:16:34.220
Two of the molecules will react
with one another.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:39.817
Okay, and that's why you can't
do a crystal structure of BH_3,

00:16:39.817 --> 00:16:43.580
because BH_3_ becomes
B_2H_6.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.210
Let's look at how it happens.
 

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:49.120
So there's the low LUMO that
makes BH_3 an acid.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.389
What's the high HOMO?
 

00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:57.870
What's the high HOMO of BH_3?
 

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.029
In localized terms.
 

00:16:59.029 --> 00:17:04.170
I don't mean these big things
that go over the whole molecule.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.910
It's the B-H bond -- right?
 

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.529
-- which was poorly matched in
energy and so on.

00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:09.460
So there.
 

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.926
Notice that the B-H bonding
electrons are big on hydrogen,

00:17:13.926 --> 00:17:15.259
small on boron.
 

00:17:15.259 --> 00:17:17.240
We saw that last lecture.
 

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.058
Okay?
 

00:17:18.058 --> 00:17:20.490
So they should overlap like
this, right?

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:26.307
And the vacant orbital on the B
should stabilize these

00:17:26.307 --> 00:17:30.700
high-energy electrons in the B-H
bond.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.721
But now, you could imagine many
different orientations of the

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:39.068
top molecule that would allow
overlap.

00:17:39.068 --> 00:17:48.720
Do you know why I chose this
particular orientation?

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:55.848
Which one acted as the acid and
which one is the base?

00:17:55.848 --> 00:17:57.406
The one on the bottom,
the vacant orbital,

00:17:57.406 --> 00:17:58.130
acted as an acid.
 

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:02.068
The one on the top acted as a
base.

00:18:02.068 --> 00:18:04.920
So what other possibility is
there?

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.838
Yoonjoo?
 

00:18:06.838 --> 00:18:10.144
Student:  So then there
also -- you could reverse the

00:18:10.144 --> 00:18:11.039
roles of them.
 

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:11.548
Prof: Ah ha!
 

00:18:11.548 --> 00:18:13.048
You could have -- so that would
make --

00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:15.680
notice incidentally,
what I forgot to mention here,

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.654
is that there are three nuclei
being held together by that pair

00:18:20.654 --> 00:18:22.180
of electrons now.
 

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.551
Originally the top molecule,
that pair of electrons,

00:18:25.551 --> 00:18:29.519
mostly on hydrogen but partly
on boron, held the hydrogen and

00:18:29.519 --> 00:18:31.038
the boron together.
 

00:18:31.038 --> 00:18:36.255
Now that same pair of electrons
is attracted -- is helping form

00:18:36.255 --> 00:18:39.618
a bond with a boron,
the bottom boron.

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:43.256
So in fact that's an unusual
kind of bond,

00:18:43.256 --> 00:18:46.981
because it's bonding three
nuclei together,

00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:48.490
not just two.
 

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.210
It's doing double,
or perhaps triple duty.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.921
So we need a new symbol to talk
about such bonds,

00:18:54.921 --> 00:18:59.559
and a reasonable one would be a
bond that looks like that.

00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:02.930
It's a Y bond.
 

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.799
We could make it blue.
 

00:19:05.799 --> 00:19:07.700
Okay?
 

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.990
But now we have,
as Yoonjoo said,

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.359
the vacant orbital on the top
and the high occupied orbital on

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:18.298
the bottom, and they can do
exactly the same thing.

00:19:18.298 --> 00:19:21.765
So we have two of these
three-center,

00:19:21.765 --> 00:19:23.593
two-electron bonds.
 

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:24.460
Right?
 

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.424
Two electrons holding three
atoms together.

00:19:27.424 --> 00:19:27.990
Right?
 

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.832
Or we can draw it that way.
 

00:19:30.832 --> 00:19:31.568
Right?
 

00:19:31.568 --> 00:19:36.170
And that's the structure of
B_2H_6.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:41.079
Two of the pairs of electrons
are each bonding three atoms

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:43.319
together instead of two.
 

00:19:43.319 --> 00:19:47.029
Any questions about this?
 

00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.858
Yes Alison?
 

00:19:47.858 --> 00:19:49.960
Student:  Is that what
the dotted line means for --

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.373
Prof: Yes,
the dotted just means it's a

00:19:51.373 --> 00:19:51.970
little different.
 

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:54.130
You could draw the solid Y if
you want to.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:58.180
There's no really standard
notation for that.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.490
But it's clear what it means.
 

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.813
It's just that a pair of
electrons is being shared among

00:20:02.813 --> 00:20:04.461
three nuclei,
rather than two,

00:20:04.461 --> 00:20:05.868
and their electron density is
--

00:20:05.868 --> 00:20:07.602
correspondingly,
if you did a difference density

00:20:07.602 --> 00:20:09.513
map,
if you could do an X-ray of

00:20:09.513 --> 00:20:12.759
this, you'd expect electron
density to build up in the

00:20:12.759 --> 00:20:14.170
middle of all three.
 

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.088
Yes Claire?
 

00:20:16.088 --> 00:20:19.005
Student:  This may seem
like a stupid question but a

00:20:19.005 --> 00:20:22.021
high HOMO, we've talked about as
a base, and a low LUMO we've

00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:23.430
talked about as an acid.
 

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.078
Prof: Yes.
 

00:20:24.078 --> 00:20:25.750
Student:  And the low
LUMO is unoccupied.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.034
If you think about it,
it's sort of receiving

00:20:29.034 --> 00:20:29.930
electrons.
 

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:30.608
Prof: Right.
 

00:20:30.608 --> 00:20:33.352
Student:  But generally,
bases are supposed to receive

00:20:33.352 --> 00:20:35.088
electrons, instead of acids,
and --

00:20:35.088 --> 00:20:36.279
Prof: No,
you got it backwards.

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:38.390
Student:  Do I?
 

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.279
Prof: Yes.
 

00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:40.058
Student:  Oh okay.
 

00:20:40.058 --> 00:20:43.910
Prof: Because H^+ is an
acid.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:44.640
Right?
 

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.029
Student:  Right.
 

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:47.259
Prof: So it obviously
can't give up electrons.

00:20:47.259 --> 00:20:48.980
There aren't any electrons.
 

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.859
An acid accepts electrons.
 

00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:53.769
Okay?
 

00:20:53.769 --> 00:20:56.777
Think about it a little bit in
the privacy of your room,

00:20:56.777 --> 00:20:57.980
and you'll see that.
 

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:58.588
Okay?
 

00:20:58.588 --> 00:21:00.931
Student:  Does the bond
between three nuclei only happen

00:21:00.931 --> 00:21:01.935
--
Prof: I can't hear very

00:21:01.935 --> 00:21:02.098
well.
 

00:21:02.098 --> 00:21:04.506
Student:  Does the bond
between the three nuclei only

00:21:04.506 --> 00:21:06.710
happen here because of the
geometry of the molecule?

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:07.009
Student:  Yes.
 

00:21:07.009 --> 00:21:11.108
And to get that,
you have to have overlap.

00:21:11.108 --> 00:21:14.246
So if you didn't have -- if the
top BH_3_ were

00:21:14.246 --> 00:21:17.667
oriented so that the B-H bond
were vertical and the boron was

00:21:17.667 --> 00:21:20.991
way up at the top,
it wouldn't overlap the other

00:21:20.991 --> 00:21:21.338
one.
 

00:21:21.338 --> 00:21:23.960
So you have to -- always to get
a bond,

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.557
you have to have overlap,
because otherwise the orbitals

00:21:26.557 --> 00:21:29.059
don't mix and you just have the
original orbitals,

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:29.598
as we've seen.
 

00:21:29.598 --> 00:21:31.349
Student:  Is this kind
of bond very common?

00:21:31.349 --> 00:21:31.740
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.750
Student:  Is this kind
of bond very common?

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.346
Prof: No,
it's not very common,

00:21:36.346 --> 00:21:39.854
because there are not many
really low energy vacant

00:21:39.854 --> 00:21:41.538
orbitals running around.
 

00:21:41.538 --> 00:21:42.309
Right?
 

00:21:42.309 --> 00:21:44.140
Boron is a very special case.
 

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.318
But a lithium can do the same
thing.

00:21:47.318 --> 00:21:50.818
But lithium doesn't have
energy, orbital energies as low

00:21:50.818 --> 00:21:53.873
as those of Boron,
because it doesn't have as big

00:21:53.873 --> 00:21:55.210
a nuclear charge.
 

00:21:55.210 --> 00:22:01.058
So boron is particularly good
at getting this kind of thing.

00:22:01.058 --> 00:22:05.362
And this answers the puzzle
about Lewis structures that we

00:22:05.362 --> 00:22:09.211
raised in Lecture two,
about how can BH_3 react with

00:22:09.211 --> 00:22:09.588
BH_3?
 

00:22:09.588 --> 00:22:10.420
Right?
 

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.288
That's how it does it,
by making three-center bonds.

00:22:14.288 --> 00:22:17.440
Now here's a True and False
quiz.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:24.537
On the basis of what you know,
is it true that low energy

00:22:24.537 --> 00:22:29.480
molecular orbitals result in
bonding?

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.368
True or false?
 

00:22:32.368 --> 00:22:34.130
I don't think you trust me
anymore.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:35.990
&gt;
 

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:40.261
We've been saying that when you
get those low orbitals -- things

00:22:40.261 --> 00:22:43.178
come together,
you get a low orbital -- that

00:22:43.178 --> 00:22:44.670
results in a bond.
 

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.069
Lots of overlap.
 

00:22:46.069 --> 00:22:49.019
&gt;
 

00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:50.839
I can't talk you into it?
 

00:22:50.839 --> 00:22:52.359
Good.
 

00:22:52.359 --> 00:22:53.769
That's false.
 

00:22:53.769 --> 00:22:57.544
What makes a bond is
lowered energy

00:22:57.544 --> 00:22:58.410
orbitals.
 

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.373
It's when things come together
and the electrons get more

00:23:01.373 --> 00:23:01.848
stable.
 

00:23:01.848 --> 00:23:05.142
It's not how low they are,
it's how much they're lowered

00:23:05.142 --> 00:23:08.374
by the coming together,
because then pulling apart they

00:23:08.374 --> 00:23:10.108
have to go back up again.
 

00:23:10.108 --> 00:23:14.276
So it's not whether they're
high or low, it's whether they

00:23:14.276 --> 00:23:15.299
get lowered.
 

00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:16.940
Okay?
 

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.450
Now, compared to what?
 

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.230
What do they have to get lower
compared to?

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.759
Student:  By the size.
 

00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:28.180
Prof: Yoonjoo?
 

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.476
Student:  So it's kind
of like how in Erwin and

00:23:30.476 --> 00:23:32.730
Goldilocks you showed the
antibonding and bonding.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.788
So wouldn't it be the reactants?
 

00:23:35.788 --> 00:23:37.971
Prof: You can say
something in fewer words than

00:23:37.971 --> 00:23:38.259
that.
 

00:23:38.259 --> 00:23:39.858
What do you compare to?
 

00:23:39.858 --> 00:23:44.980
When you say energy is lowered,
and that makes a bond,

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.170
what's it lowered,
compared to?

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.298
Christopher?
 

00:23:49.298 --> 00:23:50.970
Student:  The atoms in
their standard states.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.150
Prof: Well yes.
 

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.921
It wouldn't necessarily be
between atoms,

00:23:55.921 --> 00:23:59.869
it could be between two
molecules, like BH_3 with BH_3.

00:23:59.869 --> 00:24:01.618
But you're right.
 

00:24:01.618 --> 00:24:06.317
What it's lowered compared to
is the things it was before they

00:24:06.317 --> 00:24:07.395
came together.
 

00:24:07.395 --> 00:24:08.088
Right?
 

00:24:08.088 --> 00:24:10.970
Now these things,
before they came together,

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.650
one of them had electrons,
one didn't.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.211
Those might've been very high.
 

00:24:16.211 --> 00:24:16.809
Right?
 

00:24:16.809 --> 00:24:17.759
So they came together.
 

00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:20.060
The electrons went
substantially down,

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.990
but still aren't so very low.
 

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:26.082
They could've been very
low-energy orbitals to begin

00:24:26.082 --> 00:24:30.496
with, but not gone down very
much, because there was bad

00:24:30.496 --> 00:24:31.778
overlap say.
 

00:24:31.778 --> 00:24:35.557
So these, even though they're
lower than the ones we talked

00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:38.098
about first, would not be so
bonding.

00:24:38.098 --> 00:24:41.019
It's these that were bonding,
because they came down a lot,

00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:42.380
when the mixing happened.
 

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.400
So it's lowering.
 

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.769
Compared to what?
 

00:24:44.769 --> 00:24:48.702
Compared to the separated
components, before you made this

00:24:48.702 --> 00:24:49.048
bond.
 

00:24:49.048 --> 00:24:49.670
Right?
 

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:53.075
So when things come together,
and that results in the

00:24:53.075 --> 00:24:56.940
electrons going way down in
energy, that's a strong bond.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.579
Yes, Chenyu?
 

00:24:58.579 --> 00:24:59.140
Pardon me?
 

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.009
Student:  How far does
it have to go down?

00:25:01.009 --> 00:25:02.798
Prof: Well that's what
we're going to have to learn.

00:25:02.798 --> 00:25:04.398
That's a question of lore.
 

00:25:04.398 --> 00:25:04.828
Right?
 

00:25:04.828 --> 00:25:09.434
And it has to be at least
enough to overcome the fact that

00:25:09.434 --> 00:25:12.910
when they come together other
electrons,

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.615
other orbitals,
filled orbitals are

00:25:14.615 --> 00:25:17.358
overlapping,
which is net repulsive.

00:25:17.358 --> 00:25:20.609
So it may not be that there's
an absolute criterion.

00:25:20.609 --> 00:25:21.118
Right?
 

00:25:21.118 --> 00:25:24.978
It may be that if there are a
lot of other things opposing the

00:25:24.978 --> 00:25:27.962
coming together,
filled orbital with filled

00:25:27.962 --> 00:25:30.335
orbital,
then you have to have really

00:25:30.335 --> 00:25:31.598
enormous going down.
 

00:25:31.598 --> 00:25:34.710
So you can't make a simple
answer to that.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.819
But we'll learn as we see
examples.

00:25:37.819 --> 00:25:39.470
Okay.
 

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:47.029
So now, HOMO/LUMO mixing,
for reactivity and resonance.

00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:49.750
So reactivity means between
molecules.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:53.636
So far we've been talking
mostly about atoms coming

00:25:53.636 --> 00:25:55.970
together and forming a bond.
 

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.181
But molecules have high
orbitals and low orbitals,

00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:00.818
as in the case of BH_3.
 

00:26:00.818 --> 00:26:04.394
The B-H was a molecular
orbital, or not an atomic

00:26:04.394 --> 00:26:04.989
orbital.
 

00:26:04.989 --> 00:26:05.660
Right?
 

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.690
So when things come together,
orbitals are orbitals.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.583
If you have an unusually high
energy and an unusually low

00:26:11.583 --> 00:26:14.578
energy, and they overlap and go
down, that makes a bond.

00:26:14.578 --> 00:26:16.509
So that's between
molecules.

00:26:16.509 --> 00:26:20.830
But it turns out that what
resonance is,

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:26.150
is HOMO/LUMO mixing,
within a molecule.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:30.930
Now you might say the molecules
have certain molecular orbitals.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:32.710
How can you mix them? Right?
 

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.880
The idea is that we made our
first analysis on the basis of

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.557
localized orbitals:
σ,σ*

00:26:38.557 --> 00:26:40.316
here;
σ,σ*

00:26:40.316 --> 00:26:42.259
here;
not these big Chladni things

00:26:42.259 --> 00:26:44.068
that go over the whole thing.
 

00:26:44.068 --> 00:26:46.940
But it may be that this
σ,σ*,

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.450
and this
σ,σ*,

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.838
are near one another and
overlap.

00:26:50.838 --> 00:26:53.358
So that when we made our
initial analysis,

00:26:53.358 --> 00:26:56.900
and looked only at this and
only with this,

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.252
we didn't take into account
that this one might interact

00:27:00.252 --> 00:27:04.368
with this one,
and give still lower energy.

00:27:04.368 --> 00:27:07.996
When that kind of thing is
important, that's when you have

00:27:07.996 --> 00:27:10.349
to draw other resonance
structures.

00:27:10.349 --> 00:27:13.509
And I'll show you an example.
 

00:27:13.509 --> 00:27:17.369
But first I'm going to show you
reactivity, and then we'll go on

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:18.288
to resonance.
 

00:27:18.288 --> 00:27:23.480
Okay, now let's look at the
frontier orbitals for H-F.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.038
Okay?
 

00:27:25.038 --> 00:27:30.531
So it has four valence electron
pairs and five valence atomic

00:27:30.531 --> 00:27:34.262
orbitals;
2s, 2p_x_y_z on

00:27:34.262 --> 00:27:39.429
fluorine, and a 1s on
hydrogen, and four pairs of

00:27:39.429 --> 00:27:40.650
electrons.
 

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:43.288
So there are going to be four
occupied orbitals.

00:27:43.288 --> 00:27:46.900
And this is what the lowest
orbital looks like.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.318
What does it look like?
 

00:27:50.318 --> 00:27:53.602
Prof: Well it's a 2s
orbital, the 1s being

00:27:53.602 --> 00:27:54.818
the core on fluorine.
 

00:27:54.818 --> 00:27:56.818
But it's made up of atomic
orbitals.

00:27:56.818 --> 00:28:01.038
Is it exactly a 2s of
fluorine?

00:28:01.038 --> 00:28:03.019
Does it look like sphere on
fluorine?

00:28:03.019 --> 00:28:04.720
Alison, you're shaking your
head.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.519
Student:  It's a little
bit distorted.

00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:09.019
Prof: And how did it get
a little distorted?

00:28:09.019 --> 00:28:11.609
What did we mix with the F
orbital?

00:28:11.609 --> 00:28:12.528
Student:  The H.
 

00:28:12.528 --> 00:28:14.538
Prof: A little bit of
the 1s on hydrogen.

00:28:14.538 --> 00:28:17.049
It's mostly the F on
fluorine.

00:28:17.049 --> 00:28:18.038
Why?
 

00:28:18.038 --> 00:28:21.048
Because the fluorine's way down
in energy.

00:28:21.048 --> 00:28:23.160
So the best combination is
mostly this.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.823
But you can see that it's a
little bit egg shaped,

00:28:25.823 --> 00:28:28.269
a little bit drawn out toward
the hydrogen.

00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:31.669
Okay, so it's mostly a
2s of fluorine,

00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:34.836
but a little bit of 1s
on hydrogen.

00:28:34.836 --> 00:28:35.609
Right?
 

00:28:35.609 --> 00:28:37.250
Now here's the next one.
 

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.740
What's that mostly?
 

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.240
Can you see?
 

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:47.960
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.180
Prof: Tyler,
what do you say?

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.368
Student:  I would say a
2p.

00:28:50.368 --> 00:28:52.088
Prof: It looks like a
2p on fluorine.

00:28:52.088 --> 00:28:54.281
Does it look exactly like a
2p on fluorine,

00:28:54.281 --> 00:28:56.519
or is it just hard for you to
see that it's not?

00:28:56.519 --> 00:28:57.660
It's very similar.
 

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.644
Student:  I don't know,
it looks pretty close,

00:28:59.644 --> 00:29:01.210
but the blue one might be a bit
bigger.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:02.535
Prof: Yes,
the blue one is a little bit

00:29:02.535 --> 00:29:04.508
bigger,
because it's got a little bit

00:29:04.508 --> 00:29:07.633
of the 1s of hydrogen
lowering the energy of the

00:29:07.633 --> 00:29:09.079
2p of fluorine.
 

00:29:09.079 --> 00:29:10.210
Okay?
 

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:13.779
And now the next two orbitals
are these.

00:29:13.779 --> 00:29:17.049
What are those?
 

00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:19.328
Steve, what do you say?
 

00:29:19.328 --> 00:29:20.680
Student:  The
2p_y and 2p_z.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.336
Prof: Yes,
the 2p_y and 2p_z

00:29:22.336 --> 00:29:22.819
of fluorine.
 

00:29:22.819 --> 00:29:25.880
Is there hydrogen in those too?
 

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.920
Student:  Not very much.
 

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.920
Prof: Why not?
 

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.000
Student:  Because they
don't overlap with the one --

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.130
Prof: Ah,
they're orthogonal.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.720
It's a π versus a
σ.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.920
There's no overlap,
therefore no mixing.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.660
So those are the occupied
orbitals.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.348
And the 2p's have the
same energy.

00:29:42.348 --> 00:29:46.032
Okay, and then remember there
are going to be five molecular

00:29:46.032 --> 00:29:46.720
orbitals.
 

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.994
And now you make the last one,
which is going to have another

00:29:50.994 --> 00:29:52.920
node, with the leftovers.
 

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:57.155
What's left over,
after we made the occupied

00:29:57.155 --> 00:29:58.240
orbitals?
 

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.278
What's it mostly left over?
 

00:30:01.278 --> 00:30:04.640
We used up the 2p's of
fluorine to make those HOMOs.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.440
Those were pure, right?
 

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:10.220
But what was left over from the
bottom?

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:10.920
Students:  1s.
 

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.519
Prof: We used very
little of 1s on hydrogen,

00:30:14.519 --> 00:30:17.616
and there's a little bit of
2p fluorine and 2s

00:30:17.616 --> 00:30:20.190
fluorine that we didn't use in
the bottom ones.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:21.730
So they're back in the top.
 

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:25.238
So what we have is mostly a
1s on hydrogen,

00:30:25.238 --> 00:30:29.819
but a little bit of some kind
of sp hybrid on fluorine.

00:30:29.819 --> 00:30:31.589
Is that clear to everyone?
 

00:30:31.589 --> 00:30:33.828
So that's the vacant orbital.
 

00:30:33.828 --> 00:30:38.440
Is it unusual energy,
that vacant orbital?

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.670
Student:  It's low.
 

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:42.690
Prof: It's low.
 

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.309
Is it unusually low?
 

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:48.088
Kate, do you have an idea?
 

00:30:48.088 --> 00:30:51.173
What kind of criteria do we
have for whether an orbital

00:30:51.173 --> 00:30:52.660
should be unusually low?
 

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.588
What do we look for?
 

00:30:56.588 --> 00:31:01.440
Student:  We look for
overlap and energy match.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.740
Prof: Overlap.
 

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.730
Energy match.
 

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.930
How about this case,
good overlap?

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.009
Quite good overlap.
 

00:31:08.009 --> 00:31:10.851
It's a hybrid orbital on
fluorine pointed right toward a

00:31:10.851 --> 00:31:11.420
hydrogen.
 

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.019
Good overlap.
 

00:31:12.019 --> 00:31:13.480
How about the energy match?
 

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.230
Kate?
 

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:20.920
Student:  Sure.
 

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.970
Prof: Sure what?
 

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.980
Sure it's good or sure it's bad?
 

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:26.859
One of them's hydrogen.
 

00:31:26.859 --> 00:31:27.990
What's the other one?
 

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:29.240
Student:  The other one
is fluorine.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.140
Prof: Where's fluorine,
compared to hydrogen?

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:31.829
Student:  Fluorine is
going to be lower.

00:31:31.829 --> 00:31:32.390
Prof: Why?
 

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.900
Student:  It has greater
nuclear charge.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.710
Prof: Right.
 

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.630
Okay, good energy match or bad
energy match?

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:37.420
Student:  Not great.
 

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.579
Prof: Not very good.
 

00:31:38.579 --> 00:31:41.150
So you don't get much mixing.
 

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:43.327
And you know that already by
looking at the picture,

00:31:43.327 --> 00:31:44.950
because you didn't mix it very
much.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.818
It's almost all 1s of
hydrogen.

00:31:47.818 --> 00:31:50.788
So it's unusually low for a
σ*;

00:31:50.788 --> 00:31:54.098
it didn't go up very much from
hydrogen.

00:31:54.098 --> 00:31:56.788
So indeed -- now it's got an
unusually low vacant orbital.

00:31:56.788 --> 00:31:59.420
What does that make it,
an acid or a base?

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.880
Student:  An acid.
 

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.710
Prof: It's an acid.
 

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.029
Are you surprised that H-F is
an acid?

00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:04.720
Student:  No.
 

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.619
Prof: Why?
 

00:32:05.619 --> 00:32:08.019
What's its name?
 

00:32:08.019 --> 00:32:09.559
Student:  Hydrofluoric
acid.

00:32:09.559 --> 00:32:10.848
Prof: Hydrofluoric acid.
 

00:32:10.848 --> 00:32:12.818
And that's what makes it an
acid.

00:32:12.818 --> 00:32:18.019
Arrhenius would say it's an
acid because it gives up H^+.

00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:21.785
We say it's an acid because
it's an unusually low vacant

00:32:21.785 --> 00:32:22.333
orbital.
 

00:32:22.333 --> 00:32:22.950
Right?
 

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:27.482
So notice that those three are
made up of three atomic

00:32:27.482 --> 00:32:30.818
orbitals: the 1s of
hydrogen,

00:32:30.818 --> 00:32:34.410
the 2s of fluorine,
and a 2p orbital of

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:35.170
fluorine.
 

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.288
And they're in different
mixtures in three of these.

00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:39.548
Usually we've looked at just
two things, right?

00:32:39.548 --> 00:32:42.227
There's one atom,
atomic orbital,

00:32:42.227 --> 00:32:44.653
and another one,
and they mix.

00:32:44.653 --> 00:32:45.490
Right?
 

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:46.220
A pair.
 

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.703
Here there are three going in,
to give three molecular

00:32:48.703 --> 00:32:49.220
orbitals.
 

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.854
But still you can see quite
easily why they should be the

00:32:51.854 --> 00:32:54.791
way they are;
why the bottom ones are almost

00:32:54.791 --> 00:32:58.066
pure fluorine,
and the top one is almost pure

00:32:58.066 --> 00:32:58.960
hydrogen.
 

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.358
Okay.
 

00:33:01.358 --> 00:33:03.519
And so that top one is
σ*;

00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:07.430
the LUMO, the unusually low
LUMO.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:08.440
Lucas?
 

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.655
Student:  How can we be
sure that the 1s of the

00:33:11.655 --> 00:33:14.925
low nuclear-charge hydrogen is
going to be that much different

00:33:14.925 --> 00:33:18.250
from the really high nuclear
charge 2s of fluorine?

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.838
Prof: Yes,
this you have to learn.

00:33:19.838 --> 00:33:24.065
And I'm going to show you very
soon how we can tell that kind

00:33:24.065 --> 00:33:24.838
of thing.
 

00:33:24.838 --> 00:33:29.688
Okay, there's a different
picture, that was made in 1973,

00:33:29.688 --> 00:33:31.420
of the same thing.
 

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.595
These pictures were drawn just
a year or two ago,

00:33:33.595 --> 00:33:35.588
but this is -- you can see the
same thing.

00:33:35.588 --> 00:33:38.390
It's drawn at a different
contour level.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:41.730
It was based on a different
calculation.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:43.848
But you can see it's the same
thing.

00:33:43.848 --> 00:33:47.615
And we'll notice that -- how
many nodes does this thing have,

00:33:47.615 --> 00:33:49.309
that are clearly visible?
 

00:33:49.309 --> 00:33:49.970
Students:  Two.
 

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:50.779
Prof: Two nodes, right?
 

00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:52.880
Between the H and F.
 

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.480
That one is antibonding. Right?
 

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.613
When they came together they
cancelled in the middle,

00:33:58.613 --> 00:34:00.180
rather than reinforcing.
 

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.348
There's another node there.
 

00:34:02.348 --> 00:34:05.633
But notice that that didn't
have anything to do with the

00:34:05.633 --> 00:34:06.230
bonding.
 

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:10.059
That was already there in the
atomic orbital you started with.

00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:12.650
So it didn't have anything to
do with lowering.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.911
It didn't have anything to do
with whether the thing was

00:34:14.911 --> 00:34:15.940
bonding or antibonding.
 

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.050
The pink node had to do with
whether it was bonding.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.351
That came when they came
together.

00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:21.909
Right?
 

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:24.179
It's unfavorable.
 

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:26.110
So it's better for them to come
apart.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:28.367
But if they come apart,
you don't do anything with the

00:34:28.367 --> 00:34:28.880
blue node.
 

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.130
It's still there,
it's part of the atom.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:32.969
Okay?
 

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:36.179
So you have to recognize that
there are two kinds of nodes.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:38.170
There are nodes that were there
already,

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.862
atomic orbital nodes,
and there are ones that are

00:34:40.862 --> 00:34:43.050
associated with the coming
together,

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.090
and that's what makes something
bonding,

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:48.905
or antibonding;
in this particular case it's

00:34:48.905 --> 00:34:49.940
antibonding.
 

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.838
Okay now let's look,
instead of H-F,

00:34:53.838 --> 00:34:56.400
let's look at CH_3-F.
 

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.619
Sam?
 

00:34:57.619 --> 00:34:59.800
Student:  Why is it
called a frontier?

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.989
Prof: Because you have
occupied orbitals,

00:35:02.989 --> 00:35:05.760
and then you have vacant
orbitals, and the ones you're

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.898
interested in are the lowest of
the vacant and the highest of

00:35:08.898 --> 00:35:13.672
the occupied,
at this border between occupied

00:35:13.672 --> 00:35:16.268
and vacant orbitals.
 

00:35:16.268 --> 00:35:19.849
Okay, so this one has seven
valence pairs of electrons.

00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:21.889
So you're going to occupy seven
orbitals.

00:35:21.889 --> 00:35:24.960
And here's what they look like,
the seven that are occupied.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.480
What's the very lowest one,
mostly?

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.130
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.371
Prof: It's the 2s
of fluorine.

00:35:32.371 --> 00:35:32.789
Right?
 

00:35:32.789 --> 00:35:36.449
And what's the next one?
 

00:35:36.449 --> 00:35:40.474
Well it's C-H bonds,
all mixed together.

00:35:40.474 --> 00:35:41.300
Right?
 

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:45.210
But also a little bit of a
p orbital on fluorine.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.315
It has the blue,
sort of, toward the front,

00:35:47.315 --> 00:35:50.275
and a little bit of that red
behind, as part of the p

00:35:50.275 --> 00:35:51.480
orbital on fluorine.
 

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.045
So it's a mixture of the C-H
bonds and of the p

00:35:56.045 --> 00:35:58.469
orbital on fluorine.
 

00:35:58.469 --> 00:36:02.025
And then we have these others,
some of them coming in pairs,

00:36:02.025 --> 00:36:05.518
and those are the HOMOs,
because we have seven occupied.

00:36:05.518 --> 00:36:09.172
And let's look at them a little
more closely and compare them,

00:36:09.172 --> 00:36:11.329
each one, with the one beneath
it.

00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:15.983
And I'll draw another picture
too, of that older kind,

00:36:15.983 --> 00:36:18.530
for making this comparison.
 

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:22.311
And we're interested in what is
it that went together,

00:36:22.311 --> 00:36:26.164
to make these orbitals,
and why is one lower in energy,

00:36:26.164 --> 00:36:27.949
and the other higher?
 

00:36:27.949 --> 00:36:32.539
So what do you see on the top
orbital, say this one here,

00:36:32.539 --> 00:36:35.460
the top left;
what's that made up of?

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.018
What is it on the left side?
 

00:36:38.018 --> 00:36:41.869
Sophie, what would you say the
orbital is on the left side of

00:36:41.869 --> 00:36:42.320
that?
 

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.409
Student:  I think it's
2p over there.

00:36:43.409 --> 00:36:44.010
Prof: Right.
 

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:48.949
This part here is a 2p
π orbital of fluorine.

00:36:48.949 --> 00:36:55.273
Now what's this thing on the
right here, the dash bit down

00:36:55.273 --> 00:36:56.050
here?
 

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:58.586
If you just saw that,
without any of the rest of it,

00:36:58.586 --> 00:37:00.079
what would you say that was?
 

00:37:00.079 --> 00:37:01.980
Students:  1s.
 

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.860
Prof: It's more than a
1s on hydrogen;

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.429
that would be spherical.
 

00:37:06.429 --> 00:37:12.530
It's, at a certain contour,
the C-H bond.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.500
Do you see that?
 

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:19.280
So this is electron density in
here, bonding between C and H.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:23.552
And these two on the top are
little bits of C-H bonds as

00:37:23.552 --> 00:37:25.340
well, mixed together.
 

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:29.224
So what this orbital is,
is a mixture between some

00:37:29.224 --> 00:37:34.139
combination of C-H bonds on the
right, and the p orbital

00:37:34.139 --> 00:37:36.360
of fluorine on the left.
 

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:42.184
Now is it a favorable,
or an unfavorable combination,

00:37:42.184 --> 00:37:47.559
of the fluorine orbital with
the C-H orbitals?

00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:48.969
This one up here.
 

00:37:48.969 --> 00:37:53.041
Is the interaction between the
fluorine orbital and the C-H

00:37:53.041 --> 00:37:55.429
orbitals bonding or antibonding?
 

00:37:55.429 --> 00:37:55.989
Students:  Antibonding.
 

00:37:55.989 --> 00:37:59.940
Prof: Becky,
do you have an idea?

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.985
Are they building up electron
density in between,

00:38:02.985 --> 00:38:04.889
or having a node in between?
 

00:38:04.889 --> 00:38:05.659
Student:  A node.
 

00:38:05.659 --> 00:38:06.869
Prof: There's a node in
between.

00:38:06.869 --> 00:38:08.820
So that's antibonding.
 

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.679
What's the orbital on the
bottom, this one?

00:38:12.679 --> 00:38:15.349
Student:  Bonding.
 

00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:19.443
Prof: That's the same
components, but it's the bonding

00:38:19.443 --> 00:38:20.400
combination.
 

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.599
So this is the favorable
combination of those,

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:26.730
and this is their unfavorable
combination.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.643
So this lower-energy one is
favorable, and the upper energy

00:38:30.643 --> 00:38:32.599
is unfavorable combination.
 

00:38:32.599 --> 00:38:34.969
How about here and here?
 

00:38:34.969 --> 00:38:37.460
Can you see what that is?
 

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:45.021
What's on the left,
here, that lump of red and this

00:38:45.021 --> 00:38:47.289
lump of blue?
 

00:38:47.289 --> 00:38:50.010
Eric?
 

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:52.920
Here, this thing,
it's very complicated.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.440
Okay, will you agree on that?
 

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.280
Student:  Okay.
 

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.393
Prof: But part of it,
this part on the left,

00:38:59.393 --> 00:39:02.880
there's a red lump in behind
and a blue lump in front.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.090
You can see it maybe more
clearly here.

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:09.423
Red behind, and blue in front,
surrounding the green fluorine

00:39:09.423 --> 00:39:09.929
atom.
 

00:39:09.929 --> 00:39:14.510
What is that orbital,
that atomic orbital?

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.449
Student:  Probably the
p orbital.

00:39:15.449 --> 00:39:16.610
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:17.523
Student:  Probably the
p orbital,

00:39:17.523 --> 00:39:18.039
a different orientation.
 

00:39:18.039 --> 00:39:20.606
Prof: It's the p
orbital on fluorine that's

00:39:20.606 --> 00:39:22.210
pointing more or less toward
you.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.090
Okay?
 

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:27.407
So this is the p orbital
of fluorine, that's mixing with

00:39:27.407 --> 00:39:28.452
C-H bonds here.
 

00:39:28.452 --> 00:39:29.079
Right?
 

00:39:29.079 --> 00:39:33.789
In fact, it's the same thing as
this, turned on its side.

00:39:33.789 --> 00:39:36.610
Okay?
 

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:39.956
So this is the bonding
combination, built up between

00:39:39.956 --> 00:39:41.860
the fluorine and the C-H's.
 

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.865
This is the antibonding one,
with a node between the

00:39:44.865 --> 00:39:46.340
fluorine and the C-H's.
 

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:50.376
So here we have a node,
in this bottom one,

00:39:50.376 --> 00:39:54.800
but that node came from the
atomic orbitals.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.380
That's what made it a p
orbital here,

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.219
on fluorine.
 

00:39:58.219 --> 00:40:02.949
That one, you don't get rid of,
if you pull the fluorine away.

00:40:02.949 --> 00:40:05.641
That doesn't have anything to
do with the bonding,

00:40:05.641 --> 00:40:07.510
that's just an atomic orbital
node.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:08.059
Right?
 

00:40:08.059 --> 00:40:11.389
On the top, you again have the
same atomic orbital node,

00:40:11.389 --> 00:40:14.840
because it's the same p
orbital that's involved.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.070
But what about the top?
 

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:17.929
Sam?
 

00:40:17.929 --> 00:40:19.090
Student:  You have
another node but --

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:22.135
Prof: There's another
node, that one,

00:40:22.135 --> 00:40:24.331
and that's an antibonding node.
 

00:40:24.331 --> 00:40:24.969
Right?
 

00:40:24.969 --> 00:40:29.518
The electrons in that orbital
would get lower in energy if you

00:40:29.518 --> 00:40:32.800
broke the bond,
if the fluorine came away.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.079
So the pink nodes are the ones
we're interested in;

00:40:35.079 --> 00:40:39.057
the antibonding nodes,
not the ones that are just part

00:40:39.057 --> 00:40:40.860
of the atomic orbital.
 

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:41.639
Okay.
 

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:45.050
Now, we're getting to Lucas's
question.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:52.670
So this thing down here is made
up of fluorine and C-H.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:56.228
The one here is made up of
fluorine and C-H.

00:40:56.228 --> 00:40:56.889
Right?
 

00:40:56.889 --> 00:41:01.873
This is the favorable
combination, and this is the

00:41:01.873 --> 00:41:04.519
unfavorable combination.
 

00:41:04.519 --> 00:41:05.360
So get it right.
 

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.880
So here are the two of them.
 

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.458
They come together when the F
comes up to the methyl.

00:41:11.458 --> 00:41:12.010
Right?
 

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:15.489
And you get a favorable one and
an unfavorable one.

00:41:15.489 --> 00:41:22.969
But the fluorine and the C-H's
may not be at the same energy.

00:41:22.969 --> 00:41:24.809
How do you know which one's
lower?

00:41:24.809 --> 00:41:27.590
That's your question.
 

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:31.990
Is the fluorine lower,
or is the C-H lower,

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:35.030
or are they about the same?
 

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:38.268
Now how are we going to tell?
 

00:41:38.268 --> 00:41:41.525
If the fluorine is lower,
and they come together,

00:41:41.525 --> 00:41:44.510
what does the lower one look
like, mostly?

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:45.079
Student:  Fluorine.
 

00:41:45.079 --> 00:41:46.130
Prof: Fluorine.
 

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:49.197
If the fluorine's higher,
and they come together,

00:41:49.197 --> 00:41:51.369
what does the low one look
like?

00:41:51.369 --> 00:41:51.989
Student:  C-H.
 

00:41:51.989 --> 00:41:53.889
Prof: Mostly C-H, right?
 

00:41:53.889 --> 00:41:58.134
So by looking at how big these
are, we can tell which one is

00:41:58.134 --> 00:41:58.710
lower.
 

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:03.978
So when we look here,
we see that here I would say

00:42:03.978 --> 00:42:08.280
they're pretty similar,
left to right.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.525
There's not much difference
between a 2p orbital on

00:42:11.525 --> 00:42:15.000
fluorine and C-H σ
bonds; not much difference.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.478
But to the extent they're
different I would say,

00:42:17.478 --> 00:42:19.958
looking at this,
that the C-H is a little bigger

00:42:19.958 --> 00:42:22.650
here, and the fluorine is a
little bigger here.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:24.630
Would you say that?
 

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.617
So which is lower,
a C-H σ bond or

00:42:27.617 --> 00:42:29.889
the p orbital of
fluorine?

00:42:29.889 --> 00:42:30.960
Students:  C-H.
 

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.076
Prof: C-H σ
bond would be a little lower

00:42:33.076 --> 00:42:35.659
than fluorine;
not much though, pretty similar.

00:42:35.659 --> 00:42:39.190
So they're about the same,
as we say.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:42.898
But if you have to make a
choice, the C-H is a little bit

00:42:42.898 --> 00:42:46.440
lower in energy;
the fluorine's a little higher.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.199
Okay.
 

00:42:48.199 --> 00:42:51.182
Now there's also a vacant
orbital, made up with the

00:42:51.182 --> 00:42:53.570
leftovers here,
some of the leftovers.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:54.570
And what's that?
 

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:57.050
Let's look at a different
picture of it.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.739
So this has three nodes that
are obvious.

00:43:00.739 --> 00:43:03.632
There's one that's near the
fluorine atom,

00:43:03.632 --> 00:43:05.889
a node, plane,
that goes back.

00:43:05.889 --> 00:43:07.079
The furthest to the left.
 

00:43:07.079 --> 00:43:09.170
Everyone see that?
 

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:13.880
Is that an antibonding node,
or is that an atomic orbital

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.469
node?
 

00:43:14.469 --> 00:43:15.760
Student:  Atomic orbital.
 

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.632
Prof: That's part of the
fluorine atomic orbital of some

00:43:18.632 --> 00:43:19.512
hybrid on fluorine.
 

00:43:19.512 --> 00:43:19.929
Right?
 

00:43:19.929 --> 00:43:22.389
And the same is true at the C-H
end.

00:43:22.389 --> 00:43:25.623
There's a node that's an atomic
orbital node of the carbon.

00:43:25.623 --> 00:43:26.070
Right?
 

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.760
But what's important?
 

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.114
Between those other two is
what's between the fluorine and

00:43:33.114 --> 00:43:35.000
the carbon, and the CH_3_.
 

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.659
 And that's antibonding.
 

00:43:36.659 --> 00:43:42.581
So that, the LUMO is a
σ* antibond,

00:43:42.581 --> 00:43:45.480
between C and methyl.
 

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:49.268
And why is it unusually low?
 

00:43:49.268 --> 00:43:52.739
The question is whether the
LUMO should be unusually low.

00:43:52.739 --> 00:43:54.889
Why is it unusually low?
 

00:43:54.889 --> 00:43:57.159
Is the overlap bad?
 

00:43:57.159 --> 00:43:58.619
Student:  It's fine.
 

00:43:58.619 --> 00:43:59.719
Prof: No,
the overlap's good;

00:43:59.719 --> 00:44:02.909
the hybrids are pointing right
toward one another.

00:44:02.909 --> 00:44:09.119
But what makes it low in energy?
 

00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:13.000
So I'm not giving you specific
problems on this,

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.617
but look over those things and
run your brain as to those four

00:44:16.617 --> 00:44:19.702
different things that make
orbitals unusually high or

00:44:19.702 --> 00:44:20.768
unusually low.
 

00:44:20.768 --> 00:44:23.500
Because that's what you'll be
doing next week when you're

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:24.961
doing these Wikis,
each of you,

00:44:24.961 --> 00:44:27.789
to decide some functional
group, why is it functional?

00:44:27.789 --> 00:44:31.280
What makes it unusually high or
unusually low;

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.219
or maybe neither? Right?
 

00:44:33.219 --> 00:44:38.563
Why is the C-F bond,
more properly the C-F

00:44:38.563 --> 00:44:44.820
σ* orbital,
the antibonding orbital,

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.469
why is it unusually low?
 

00:44:48.469 --> 00:44:51.539
Compared to what?
 

00:44:51.539 --> 00:44:53.449
What do you compare it to?
 

00:44:53.449 --> 00:44:54.670
Student:  C-H.
 

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:56.489
Prof: A C-H bond.
 

00:44:56.489 --> 00:45:01.219
How come C-F is lower,
for the σ*?

00:45:01.219 --> 00:45:01.989
Alex?
 

00:45:01.989 --> 00:45:02.849
Student:  Energy
mismatch.

00:45:02.849 --> 00:45:03.369
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:45:03.369 --> 00:45:03.969
Student:  Energy
mismatch.

00:45:03.969 --> 00:45:06.273
Prof: Yes,
the fluorine is really low,

00:45:06.273 --> 00:45:07.739
their average is very low.
 

00:45:07.739 --> 00:45:09.789
So the vacant orbital is
unusually low.

00:45:09.789 --> 00:45:11.719
It didn't go up much. Right?
 

00:45:11.719 --> 00:45:15.670
Where have you seen that before?
 

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:18.250
H-F.
 

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.760
The previous slide,
H-F, was exactly the same.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.590
It's an acid.
 

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:24.010
Remember Kate,
you helped us with that.

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:28.137
It's an acid because of the bad
energy match between fluorine

00:45:28.137 --> 00:45:29.170
and hydrogen.
 

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:32.409
This is the same thing,
but it's the bad energy match

00:45:32.409 --> 00:45:34.280
between fluorine and carbon.
 

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:34.789
Okay.
 

00:45:34.789 --> 00:45:44.724
So CH_3-F is an acid for the
same reason that H-F is an acid.

00:45:44.724 --> 00:45:46.050
Right?
 

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:48.338
There's the low LUMO of H-F.
 

00:45:48.338 --> 00:45:48.909
Right?
 

00:45:48.909 --> 00:45:52.590
It's got that same antibonding
node.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:53.409
Shai?
 

00:45:53.409 --> 00:45:58.288
Student:  Why is there
no energy mismatch between

00:45:58.288 --> 00:46:00.239
carbon and hydrogen?
 

00:46:00.239 --> 00:46:03.440
Prof: It just happens
that it worked out that way.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.010
But it's true.
 

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:06.489
Hydrogen is 1s.
 

00:46:06.489 --> 00:46:07.719
That makes it unusually low.
 

00:46:07.719 --> 00:46:09.889
But it doesn't have a very big
nuclear charge.

00:46:09.889 --> 00:46:12.922
Carbon has a higher nuclear
charge, but you're talking

00:46:12.922 --> 00:46:14.409
2s and 2p.
 

00:46:14.409 --> 00:46:17.170
And it turns out those just
cancel out.

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:20.000
If that hadn't been the case,
organic chemists --

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.190
like if boron happened to match
hydrogen,

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:27.347
then maybe our organic
chemistry would be

00:46:27.347 --> 00:46:29.960
boron-hydrogen,
not -- there would be

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.059
borohydrates,
not carbohydrates. Right?

00:46:33.059 --> 00:46:35.250
But that's the way things are.
 

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:36.949
Student:  So in this
picture we can tell that --

00:46:36.949 --> 00:46:38.632
Prof: Actually there are
other reasons it wouldn't be

00:46:38.632 --> 00:46:40.570
boron,
because boron has these vacant

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.260
orbitals and forms B_2H_6_
and so on.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.570
But it just happens that that
cancellation works that way.

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:47.090
Lucas?
 

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:50.313
Student:  Just by
looking at this picture we can

00:46:50.313 --> 00:46:52.963
say that CH_3,
that there's poor energy match

00:46:52.963 --> 00:46:56.065
because the orbitals around
fluorine are much smaller than

00:46:56.065 --> 00:46:57.210
those around CH_3.
 

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:59.940
Prof: Let's look at the
next slide here.

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.110
Is it this one? No.
 

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:01.860
We're going to get to that.
 

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.824
If you looked at ones that were
very badly mismatched,

00:47:04.824 --> 00:47:07.735
then the favorable and
unfavorable combinations would

00:47:07.735 --> 00:47:08.909
be very dramatic.
 

00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:12.389
Actually, you've already seen
that in H-F.

00:47:12.389 --> 00:47:15.518
Okay, we have one minute to
start this.

00:47:15.518 --> 00:47:22.150
Okay, so we're going to look at
how CH_3-F behaves like H-F.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:23.050
Right?
 

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:24.110
Both of them are acids.
 

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:26.679
So first we'll look at H-F,
and next time we'll go on to

00:47:26.679 --> 00:47:27.099
CH_3-F.
 

00:47:27.099 --> 00:47:28.929
So here's H-F.
 

00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:32.260
So you have to bring -- here's
a low vacant orbital.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.530
We've talked about that ad
nauseam.

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:35.130
Okay?
 

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:37.820
Now you want to get good
overlap.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.460
From what direction will
another orbital come,

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:43.923
in order to get good overlap,
without the nuclei getting too

00:47:43.923 --> 00:47:45.039
close together?
 

00:47:45.039 --> 00:47:47.588
Obviously it'll come from off
in the right,

00:47:47.588 --> 00:47:50.746
where this orbital is big,
where you can get a lot of

00:47:50.746 --> 00:47:53.659
overlap without getting close to
the nuclei.

00:47:53.659 --> 00:47:56.675
So if you had something with a
high-energy pair of electrons,

00:47:56.675 --> 00:47:59.340
it would come and it would
overlap, from the right;

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.510
something like OH^-.
 

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:05.889
And you'd draw a curved arrow,
to show those electrons;

00:48:05.889 --> 00:48:10.027
the high HOMO of OH^-,
being stabilized by the vacant

00:48:10.027 --> 00:48:11.380
orbital of H-F.
 

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.440
And how would you draw the
curved arrow?

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:18.018
Where would it start,
where would it end?

00:48:18.018 --> 00:48:24.510
To show the electrons of OH^-
forming a bond with -- OH bond?

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:27.079
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:48:27.079 --> 00:48:30.010
Prof: You'd start from
the pair of electrons that

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.570
you're talking about,
and you'd end between H and

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:33.369
O.***Right?
 

00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:37.432
But that means -- this is
really important -- that means

00:48:37.432 --> 00:48:41.126
you're putting electrons,
putting electron density,

00:48:41.126 --> 00:48:42.456
into this orbital.
 

00:48:42.456 --> 00:48:43.268
Right?
 

00:48:43.268 --> 00:48:50.335
What effect does putting
electrons in that orbital have

00:48:50.335 --> 00:48:52.690
on the H-F bond?
 

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:54.320
Okay, the curved arrows,
blah-blah;

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.760
we did that.
 

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.860
Sherwin?
 

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.280
Student:  It's like it
pushes them out.

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.030
Prof: It's what?
 

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:05.260
What do you call that orbital?
 

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.655
What's the name of the orbital,
that we're putting electrons

00:49:08.655 --> 00:49:09.059
into?
 

00:49:09.059 --> 00:49:09.969
Student:  1s for
--

00:49:09.969 --> 00:49:11.199
Prof: It's
σ*.

00:49:11.199 --> 00:49:13.306
It's mostly 1s on
Hydrogen, but it's

00:49:13.306 --> 00:49:14.210
σ*.
 

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:15.780
What does * mean?
 

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.610
Students:  Antibonding.
 

00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:18.820
Prof: What does it mean
if you put electrons in?

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.800
Student:  The bond
breaks.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.192
Prof: The bond will
break.

00:49:21.192 --> 00:49:21.539
Right?
 

00:49:21.539 --> 00:49:24.159
It has that antibonding node.
 

00:49:24.159 --> 00:49:29.494
So electrons that go into that
will get more stable if the bond

00:49:29.494 --> 00:49:30.268
breaks.
 

00:49:30.268 --> 00:49:35.719
So we're going to draw another
curved arrow,

00:49:35.719 --> 00:49:37.239
like that.
 

00:49:37.239 --> 00:49:41.887
So we make a new bond between H
and O, but we lose the bond

00:49:41.887 --> 00:49:43.329
between H and F.
 

00:49:43.329 --> 00:49:44.639
So there's our product.
 

00:49:44.639 --> 00:49:50.092
That's an acid-base reaction,
and it showed H-F acting as an

00:49:50.092 --> 00:49:52.280
acid;
not because it gave H^+.

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.376
H^+ never appears in here.
 

00:49:55.376 --> 00:49:56.210
Right?
 

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:59.592
What happened is you make a
bond and break a bond to the

00:49:59.592 --> 00:50:00.269
hydrogen.
 

00:50:00.269 --> 00:50:02.159
So it's an acid-base reaction.
 

00:50:02.159 --> 00:50:05.244
And the same thing,
we'll show next time,

00:50:05.244 --> 00:50:07.019
happens with CH _3-F.
 

00:50:07.019 --> 00:50:07.900
Okay.

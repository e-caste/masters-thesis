00:00:02.867 --> 00:00:05.433
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: We're
talking about alkenes, 

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:06.433
and in particular today, 

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:08.767
we're going to be continuing to
talk about 

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:12.867
polymerization in the context of
things that nature makes, 

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:14.900
which are called isoprenoids. 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.767
And then we'll, talk about the
properties of polymers, and 

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.000
then go onto acetylenes. 

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:25.133
We're talking about
electrophiles being the things 

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:28.667
that attack double bonds, in
particular, ones where the 

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:32.800
electrophile is carbon, like the
sigma-star of something 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.300
with a leaving group on it, or
with an electronegative group 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.800
on it, or a cation. 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.400
We're talking about the
synthesis of 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.733
terpenes and steroids. 

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:48.533
There's a key molecule called
isopentenyl pyrophosphate: 

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:52.133
pyrophosphate is this thing with
two phospohorouses linked 

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.633
by an oxygen. 

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.467
It turns out you can do an
allylic rearrangement I mean, 

00:00:57.467 --> 00:01:02.300
when I say you, I mean you I
mean the enzymes in you do it. 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.367
So you can get from isopentenyl
pyrophosphate to 

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:11.767
dimethylallyl pyrophosphate,
which you know involves a 

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:16.000
shift of hydrogen allylically. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.967
Now, the reason you do that is
to make it 

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:21.133
better for SN2 reactions. 

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.733
If you look at the relative rate
for displacement of 

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:28.133
chloride by iodide in acetone,
if you call it 1 for propyl 

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:31.600
chloride, if you make allyl
chloride, so you put a double 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.233
bond to make the carbon-chlorine
bond allylic, 

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:39.033
it goes up by almost a 100 fold,
a factor of 90. 

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:42.167
And, if it's a benzene ring
instead of just a regular old 

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:47.233
double bond, it goes up another
factor of 2.5. 

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:51.800
So, apparently this adjacent
unsaturation, that new double 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.067
bond, is especially good in
stabilizing at 

00:01:58.067 --> 00:01:59.267
the transition state. 

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:02.767
So at the time when chloride is
leaving, and iodide is 

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:06.433
coming in, the double bond is
able to interact with that 

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:09.267
orbital that's bonding
simultaneously, that 

00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:12.567
pentavalent carbon transition
state. 

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:16.700
So both SN2 as well as SN1,
where you draw a resonance 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.233
structure for that kind of
interaction, for the cation. 

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:22.367
It's good to have it allylic. 

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:25.800
Notice that this shift, this
allylic shift from isopentenyl 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.567
pyrophosphate to dimethylallyl
pyrophosphate, 

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:33.300
resulted in getting the leaving
group to be allylic, 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.400
so it'll be easier to displace.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.600
Why do you do that? 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.267
So you can take as a nucleophile
then, if you have 

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:42.833
this really good leaving group,
you can take as a 

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:46.400
nucleophile the isopentenyl
pyrophosphate, so it's a 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.700
carbon that's serving as the
nucleophile. 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.833
So you make a new bond, get a
cation, but the cation can be 

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:58.867
lost by losing a proton next
door to make a new double 

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:04.033
bond, which you'll notice is a
new allylic functionality with 

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:05.367
a leaving group. 

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:08.100
So you put two of these things
together, and you have the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.033
same kind of functionality you
had at the beginning. 

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:15.667
That thing is called geranyl
pyrophosphate, because it's 

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:19.733
related to geraniums, as well
see. 

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:22.967
Notice that the starting
material has five carbons, now 

00:03:22.967 --> 00:03:26.900
having put two together, you
have ten. 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.067
So if you take geranyl
pyrophosphate, and isomerize 

00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:35.867
the double bond, then it's in a
position for the other 

00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:38.033
double bond in the same molecule
to be the 

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:39.700
nucleophile. 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.633
So you can do that, and get that
cation. 

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:45.567
What could that cation do? 

00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:47.700
Well, of course it could do the
same thing it did before, 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.400
and lose a proton, and that
gives limonene, and I made it 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.133
sort of yellow-green, you know
why? 

00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:00.800
To make it a little bit like
lemons or limes. 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.167
Lemon grass oil has limonene in
it, Asian cooking has that. 

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:08.900
If you bend it up, then you can
see another possibility. 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.167
What other possibility do you
see if I draw the conformation 

00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:13.267
more like that? 

00:04:13.267 --> 00:04:14.700
Anurag you got an idea? 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.367
STUDENT: Bridging? 

00:04:16.367 --> 00:04:20.733
PROFESSOR: Right, that double
bond could add to the vacant 

00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:26.100
orbital on the carbon, like
that, a Markovnikov addition. 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.667
Why is it not so good, Anurag? 

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.400
STUDENT: Steric. For steric
reasons. 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.367
PROFESSOR: It forms a
four-membered ring, so there's 

00:04:33.367 --> 00:04:35.267
going to be some ring strain
there. 

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:37.600
But it does happen. 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.267
If you lose the proton now, you
get a compound called 

00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:41.267
beta-pinene. 

00:04:41.267 --> 00:04:43.167
Guess what kind of trees that
comes from? 

00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:49.133
Now you could also do an
anti-Markovnikov addition, 

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:52.933
which doesn't form quite as
strained a ring. 

00:04:52.933 --> 00:04:56.400
If you do that, and then add
water, and lose a proton to 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.167
the carbon cation, you get after
oxidation, camphor. 

00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:05.767
Now all these things have in
common that they have very 

00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:08.967
characteristic odors, the lemon,
the 

00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:12.633
pinene, turpentine, camphor. 

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:18.000
So these things are called
terpenes, essential oils. 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.700
Terpene is from turpentine,
that's where pinene is the 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.867
major constituent of turpentine.

00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:28.500
Essential oils doesn't mean you
need them, what it means 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.000
is they have an essence, they
have an odor, so these C10's 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.800
are volatile, and your nose
responds to them. 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.167
These are essential oils, and
notice they're C10's, 

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:41.667
terpenes are C10's. 

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:43.767
Now you can do more of the same,
if you start with your 

00:05:43.767 --> 00:05:47.033
geranyl pyrophosphate that you
had before, you could add 

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:50.067
another isopentenyl
pyrophosphate, and get a thing 

00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:53.700
that's called farnesyl
pyrophosphate. 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.700
And things that come from that,
like the compounds that 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.967
came from the C10, were called
terpenes, these are called 

00:06:00.967 --> 00:06:01.533
sesquiterpenes. 

00:06:01.533 --> 00:06:03.100
Do you know what sesqui- means?

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.767
Do you know what a
sesquicentennial is? 

00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:11.567
Sesqui-, anybody? 

00:06:11.567 --> 00:06:14.400
It means one and a half, so it's
one and a 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.233
half terpenes, 15. 

00:06:16.233 --> 00:06:19.367
It's actually three of the
isopentenyl pyrophosphates, 

00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:23.733
but the name terpene came first.
So, for example, 

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:27.267
caryophyllene, which is in
clove, and hemp, and rosemary, 

00:06:27.267 --> 00:06:30.500
is a sesquiterpene. 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.167
Now, two of those things can
come together, and now this 

00:06:33.167 --> 00:06:36.867
reaction is different, because
it's not the double bond 

00:06:36.867 --> 00:06:40.633
attacking, it's two of these
allylic positions coupling 

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:41.267
with one another. 

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:42.967
It's a different kind of
reaction, we're not going to 

00:06:42.967 --> 00:06:44.033
talk about it. 

00:06:44.033 --> 00:06:46.533
But, it couples to give this,
which is squalene, 

00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:50.100
or shark liver oil. 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.600
You see the new bond in the
middle, it's symmetric about 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.900
the middle. 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.367
You can do interesting things
with squalene. 

00:06:56.367 --> 00:06:58.133
What kind of terpene would you
call it 

00:06:58.133 --> 00:06:59.367
incidentally, squalene? 

00:07:03.367 --> 00:07:07.267
If you take two 15's, you get
30. 

00:07:07.267 --> 00:07:08.500
So, what are you going to call
it? 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:14.667
Is it a monoterpene,
sesquiterpene, diterpene? 

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:17.767
It's a triterpene, two one and a
half's is three, so this is 

00:07:17.767 --> 00:07:19.267
a triterpene. 

00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:22.733
They're a lot more important
triterpenes, well more 

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:24.867
important, they come from this,
so this one is a 

00:07:24.867 --> 00:07:26.567
starting point. 

00:07:26.567 --> 00:07:28.900
There's squalene, and I'm going
to twist it around into 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.400
a special conformation like
that. 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.133
What allows me to do that? 

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:37.567
Enzymes that hold these things
in particular shapes. 

00:07:37.567 --> 00:07:40.433
Now, I'm going to react it with
oxygen and do an 

00:07:40.433 --> 00:07:43.833
epoxidation, of course it's not
just O, it's something 

00:07:43.833 --> 00:07:46.033
like the reagents we talked
about, except it's done 

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:47.100
biologically. 

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.200
But, we're not interested in the
particulars of the 

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.633
biological reagent, but it makes
an expoxide. 

00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:57.567
Notice that it's able to do it
selectively, it gets only that 

00:07:57.567 --> 00:07:59.300
double bond among all those. 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.633
Now you protonate that, and what
will it do? 

00:08:06.633 --> 00:08:08.700
Can you see a way this can
become more stable? 

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.967
What makes it unstable? 

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:16.800
Chris? 

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.767
STUDENT: Ring strain. 

00:08:17.767 --> 00:08:18.900
PROFESSOR: The ring strain. 

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.367
How do you get rid of the ring
strain? 

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:24.067
Which way are you going to break
it? 

00:08:24.067 --> 00:08:26.467
STUDENT: Which side? 

00:08:26.467 --> 00:08:29.633
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you're either
going to break this bond, or 

00:08:29.633 --> 00:08:31.367
this bond, or this bond. 

00:08:31.367 --> 00:08:32.433
One, two, three. 

00:08:32.433 --> 00:08:33.167
STUDENT: Two. 

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:35.433
PROFESSOR: Two, why two? 

00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:38.133
STUDENT: Better stability. 

00:08:38.133 --> 00:08:39.033
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:08:39.033 --> 00:08:39.867
STUDENT: Better stability. 

00:08:39.867 --> 00:08:43.300
PROFESSOR: Why better stability?

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.267
Notice that what's happened,
these electrons that are 

00:08:45.267 --> 00:08:47.167
shared between O and carbon are
going to 

00:08:47.167 --> 00:08:48.033
come onto the oxygen. 

00:08:48.033 --> 00:08:50.433
STUDENT: It's a better
carbocation. 

00:08:50.433 --> 00:08:52.833
PROFESSOR: Right, it's a
tertiary carbon cation if you 

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:53.800
break it your way. 

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.133
OK, so we'll do it that way. 

00:08:56.133 --> 00:08:57.200
Now, what's that going to do? 

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.433
Anybody got an idea? 

00:09:03.633 --> 00:09:05.233
Natalie, what have we been
looking at 

00:09:05.233 --> 00:09:08.733
attacking double bonds? 

00:09:08.733 --> 00:09:11.033
We're looking at carbon cations
attacking double 

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:12.733
bonds, any possibilities you
see? 

00:09:12.733 --> 00:09:15.333
STUDENT: It could attack the
double bonds. 

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:17.067
PROFESSOR: OK. 

00:09:17.067 --> 00:09:19.567
Now, you're going to form a bond
between this cation and 

00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:21.200
either the bottom one or the top
one. 

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.100
Which one do you want to go to,
bottom or top, if you have 

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.533
a cation adding to an alkene? 

00:09:25.533 --> 00:09:29.067
STUDENT: Bottom. 

00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:32.167
PROFESSOR: Why bottom? 

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:38.967
Who would say that's a good
idea? 

00:09:38.967 --> 00:09:39.767
STUDENT: Markovnikov. 

00:09:39.767 --> 00:09:42.467
PROFESSOR: Markovnikov would say
it's a good idea. 

00:09:42.467 --> 00:09:45.700
You're right, so we do a
Markovnikov addition. 

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.967
What happens next? 

00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:50.500
Noelle, you got an idea? 

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.200
STUDENT: The same. 

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.833
PROFESSOR: Do the same thing
again, do 

00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:55.067
another Markovnikov addition. 

00:09:58.667 --> 00:09:59.900
What's next? 

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.333
Wrong, this time it's an
anti-Markovnikov addition, 

00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:14.967
because of the way the molecule
is held there. 

00:10:14.967 --> 00:10:16.800
But, now you're set up to do
another one, 

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.067
a Markovnikov one. 

00:10:22.167 --> 00:10:24.867
Now you might think you'd use
that last double bond and make 

00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:28.133
another ring, since you're on a
roll here. 

00:10:28.133 --> 00:10:31.100
But you don't, and the reason is
the way the molecule is 

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.700
held, so that that one's not in
position to do the trick. 

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.967
But, something else happens. 

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.267
Notice that's nice and stable,
it's a tertiary cation, but 

00:10:41.267 --> 00:10:43.400
there's another tertiary cation
available. 

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.400
Do you see how to get to it? 

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.667
Sebastian, you got an idea? 

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.600
How can I get from this cation
to a different tertiary 

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.367
cation, one that would be just
as stable. 

00:10:55.367 --> 00:10:56.567
STUDENT: Hydride shift. 

00:10:56.567 --> 00:10:58.933
PROFESSOR: Hydride shift, good.

00:10:58.933 --> 00:11:02.667
So that's tertiary, but we can
do a hydride shift, and get 

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:03.900
another tertiary one. 

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:11.633
Any ideas for the next one? 

00:11:11.633 --> 00:11:14.267
Lauren, you got an idea? 

00:11:14.267 --> 00:11:16.133
We've got a nice stable tertiary
cation. 

00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:18.533
We can go back there, probably.

00:11:18.533 --> 00:11:21.200
Any other possibilities of
getting it a tertiary one? 

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.133
STUDENT: The one to the left. 

00:11:22.133 --> 00:11:24.800
PROFESSOR: The one on the left,
you could do another hydride 

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.367
shift. So that's tertiary, too.

00:11:28.367 --> 00:11:30.000
What's next? 

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.067
Arvind, you got an idea? 

00:11:31.067 --> 00:11:34.000
STUDENT: You might as well just
do the methide. 

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.367
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the methide
shift. 

00:11:36.367 --> 00:11:38.033
OK, good. 

00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:40.467
Next, Antonia? 

00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:42.267
STUDENT: Another methide shift.

00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:44.833
PROFESSOR: Another methide
shift, we're 

00:11:44.833 --> 00:11:46.300
really going to town. 

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:46.900
Now what? 

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.633
STUDENT: Hydride shift. 

00:11:49.633 --> 00:11:54.167
PROFESSOR: Hydride shift,
obviously, right? 

00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:56.533
Wrong. 

00:11:56.533 --> 00:12:01.367
This time the proton just gets
lost, so it goes that way, the 

00:12:01.367 --> 00:12:04.733
arrow, makes a double bond and
the proton goes away. 

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.233
Now that stuff is lanosterol and
that's the source of 

00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:14.500
cholesterol and all the steroid
hormones. 

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.833
Remember these few things we
showed last time that Barton 

00:12:16.833 --> 00:12:19.100
was looking at, all these
steroids? 

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.467
They have a 6-membered,
6-membered, 6-membered ring 

00:12:21.467 --> 00:12:23.033
and then a 5-membered ring, and
something 

00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:24.533
substituted at the top. 

00:12:24.533 --> 00:12:25.767
They all come from here. 

00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:34.567
These are triterpenes. 

00:12:34.567 --> 00:12:41.467
Now that's a cute story, but one
wonders whether it's true? 

00:12:41.467 --> 00:12:45.000
We'll show how you know it's
true, once we get to NMR 

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.100
spectroscopy, the week after
next, probably. 

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.867
But, you'll have to hold your
breath until then. 

00:12:51.867 --> 00:12:55.233
So, these isoprenes then, you
can think about rearranging 

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:57.833
those double bonds. 

00:12:57.833 --> 00:13:01.467
Notice that isopentenyl
pyrophosphate has this C5 unit 

00:13:01.467 --> 00:13:05.700
in, but if you do that you can
make two new bonds. 

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.300
I'm not talking about
cation/anion mechanisms, just 

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.767
schematic here. 

00:13:10.767 --> 00:13:13.033
If you have two isoprenes you
could link it together like 

00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:18.933
that, and that's geraniol, rose
oil, or you can have two 

00:13:18.933 --> 00:13:20.567
isoprenes and put them together
like 

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:24.267
that, and that's menthol. 

00:13:24.267 --> 00:13:26.933
Or, you could have of four of
them, and put them together 

00:13:26.933 --> 00:13:31.433
like that, and that's retinal,
the aldehyde over on the 

00:13:31.433 --> 00:13:34.867
right, so that's the thing
that's involved in vision, or 

00:13:34.867 --> 00:13:38.500
that absorbs light in your eyes.
So it's a tetramer. 

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:43.367
Or, you can take 30,000
isoprenes, and link them 

00:13:43.367 --> 00:13:47.167
together like that, and that's
latex. 

00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:50.167
The Latin word latex just meant
a liquid, but now it's 

00:13:50.167 --> 00:13:52.800
always applied to this
particular liquid, the sap 

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.900
that runs out of these trees,
the Hevea brasiliensis. 

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:01.167
There's a real romantic story
about this, and how explorers 

00:14:01.167 --> 00:14:04.967
stole seeds from Brazil, which
was trying to keep them, and 

00:14:04.967 --> 00:14:07.633
took them to England and grew
them in Kew, and then sent 

00:14:07.633 --> 00:14:11.567
them to southeast Asia to make
rubber plantations like this. 

00:14:11.567 --> 00:14:16.000
The rubber plantations in Brazil
failed because once you 

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.633
put the trees all close
together, so that you can 

00:14:18.633 --> 00:14:21.267
harvest them efficiently, rather
than sending slaves out 

00:14:21.267 --> 00:14:24.800
into the Amazon to find a tree
here and a tree there, then it 

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.733
turned out they got a disease
that killed all the ones down 

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:28.967
in South America. 

00:14:28.967 --> 00:14:31.967
Henry Ford had a real disaster
with that. 

00:14:31.967 --> 00:14:35.033
Anyhow, you get that sap, and we
showed you the sap last 

00:14:35.033 --> 00:14:40.400
time, and we made a rubber ball
with it like this. 

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.800
Now, that stuff was called by
the Indians, caoutchouc, and 

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.133
in fact that's the name for
rubber in French. 

00:14:48.133 --> 00:14:51.400
So people tried to find a use
for it in the west, you know 

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.567
the natives made balls, they
made galoshes, you know you 

00:14:54.567 --> 00:14:56.900
put your foot down in latex and
let it dry, and then 

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.800
you've got a rubber boot. 

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.900
There were lots of things, but
it was difficult to work with. 

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.967
Thomas Hancock in England
developed a thing called a 

00:15:05.967 --> 00:15:09.600
"masticator" to try to chew it
up to make it so you could 

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.400
make different things with it. 

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:17.267
Charles Macintosh in Scotland in
1823 sandwiched the rubber 

00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:20.133
between cloth layers to make
waterproofs, you know that's 

00:15:20.133 --> 00:15:22.367
what you call a waterproof
jacket in 

00:15:22.367 --> 00:15:23.600
Britain is a Macintosh. 

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:29.533
The reason you had to sandwich
it, was because the stuff is 

00:15:29.533 --> 00:15:31.167
really sticky. 

00:15:31.167 --> 00:15:33.933
I had a piece I was going to
bring that I made last time, 

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.633
and I forgot to, but it's really
sticky stuff. 

00:15:36.633 --> 00:15:39.400
So, that's not so good. 

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.367
It gets really gooey in the
heat, and it's brittle in the 

00:15:43.367 --> 00:15:46.100
cold, so there's a fairly narrow
temperature range where 

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.900
it's useful. 

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:53.900
Until Charles Goodyear in 1839
figured out the process of 

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:59.833
vulcanization, which made this
stuff useful. 

00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:03.567
This is his own description from
his autobiography in 1855 

00:16:03.567 --> 00:16:06.233
of the discovery of
vulcanization. 

00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:10.033
He actually, he was really nuts
about rubber. 

00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:14.333
Incidentally, the word rubber
was coined by Priestley, the 

00:16:14.333 --> 00:16:17.800
guy who discovered oxygen. 

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.667
You know why? 

00:16:18.667 --> 00:16:21.433
Because you use it for an eraser
to rub out pencil 

00:16:21.433 --> 00:16:22.933
marks, so "rubber." 

00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:29.500
Anyhow, Goodyear really loved
rubber. 

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.767
In this book, he printed several
copies on paper, but 

00:16:32.767 --> 00:16:36.133
other copies he printed on
rubber, which is now all stuck 

00:16:36.133 --> 00:16:39.600
together and you can't open any
of the pages. 

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.267
Anyhow, in describing his
discovery, he said "he," that 

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:45.867
is himself, speaking in the
third person here. "He was 

00:16:45.867 --> 00:16:49.800
surprised to find that the
specimen, being carelessly 

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.900
brought into contact with a hot
stove, charred like 

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.900
leather." He was trying to
figure some way to make it not 

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.667
be sticky, so he thought you
could put a powder on it to 

00:16:58.667 --> 00:16:59.867
keep it from being sticky. 

00:16:59.867 --> 00:17:04.133
The powder he was trying was
sulfur, but he was in Woburn, 

00:17:04.133 --> 00:17:06.500
Mass, when he was doing this,
and he dropped it on a hot 

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.633
stove, and it charred, whereas
usually it melted. 

00:17:11.633 --> 00:17:15.267
This surprised him, so he got
his friends and relations. 

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:17.333
It says, "He endeavoured to call
the attention of his 

00:17:17.333 --> 00:17:20.467
brother, as well as some other
individuals who were present, 

00:17:20.467 --> 00:17:22.900
and who were acquainted with the
manufacturer of gum 

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.933
elastic, to this effect, as
remarkable, and unlike any 

00:17:26.933 --> 00:17:29.733
before known, since gum elastic
always melted when 

00:17:29.733 --> 00:17:33.100
exposed to a high degree of
heat. 

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:37.033
The occurrence did not at the
time seem to them to be worthy 

00:17:37.033 --> 00:17:40.933
of notice; it was considered as
one of the frequent appeals 

00:17:40.933 --> 00:17:43.633
that he was in the habit of
making, in behalf of some new 

00:17:43.633 --> 00:17:48.700
experiment." So, they're tired
of all his inventions. 

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.733
But, he showed it to Benjamin
Silliman at Yale. 

00:17:52.733 --> 00:17:55.700
And Silliman wrote, "Having seen
experiments made, and 

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.500
also performed them myself, with
the India rubber prepared 

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.133
by Mr. Charles Goodyear, I can
state that it does not melt, 

00:18:02.133 --> 00:18:05.033
but rather chars, by heat, and
that it does not stiffen by 

00:18:05.033 --> 00:18:08.333
cold, but retains its
flexibility with cold, even 

00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:12.267
when laid between cakes of ice."
So this is what 

00:18:12.267 --> 00:18:15.700
Goodyear, who didn't have much
money, needed in terms of a 

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.367
serious endorsement, to go out
and try to get some capital to 

00:18:19.367 --> 00:18:20.267
commercialize this. 

00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:22.667
So, he got a patent, and this is
the 

00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:23.900
beginnings of the patent. 

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.467
He says, he claims "combining
said gum with sulphur and with 

00:18:27.467 --> 00:18:30.133
white lead, so as to form a
triple compound," the lead's 

00:18:30.133 --> 00:18:34.333
not used anymore, "in
combination with the forgoing, 

00:18:34.333 --> 00:18:37.533
the process of exposing the
india-rubber fabric, to the 

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:39.967
action of a high degree of
heat." He had made a whole 

00:18:39.967 --> 00:18:42.800
bunch of raincoats, sort of
Macintosh style, and had put 

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.567
them in the closet during the
summer to bring out when it 

00:18:46.567 --> 00:18:49.233
got rainy again, and when he
went to get them, they were 

00:18:49.233 --> 00:18:51.067
just all one big gooey mass. 

00:18:51.067 --> 00:18:54.333
So this was really appealing to
him, to patent this, so he 

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:56.133
could make fabric from it. 

00:18:56.133 --> 00:18:58.533
This is 1844. 

00:18:58.533 --> 00:19:02.867
Seven years later was the
Crystal Palace exhibition in 

00:19:02.867 --> 00:19:07.100
London, the triumph of industry
in the West, in the 

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.633
Victorian Period. 

00:19:08.633 --> 00:19:11.967
There were these industrial
displays of the best products 

00:19:11.967 --> 00:19:14.933
from all over the world, and
here only seven years after 

00:19:14.933 --> 00:19:19.167
the patent, we find Goodyear's
Vulcanite Court, where he's 

00:19:19.167 --> 00:19:22.367
pushing the beauties of rubber.

00:19:22.367 --> 00:19:26.000
You see, there's a desk, and
that desk is made of rubber, 

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.700
and it still exists, it's in a
museum up in Waterbury. 

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.400
He made everything out of
rubber, you can't believe all 

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.533
the things he made out of
rubber. 

00:19:33.533 --> 00:19:37.967
He proposed making bills for
currency out of rubber, so 

00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:40.900
that you could wash them without
destroying them. 

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.733
A lot of these things didn't
catch on. 

00:19:43.733 --> 00:19:46.267
Anyhow, latex is this polymer. 

00:19:46.267 --> 00:19:48.733
What do you do when you heat it
with sulfur? 

00:19:48.733 --> 00:19:51.233
Well, you have several chains
next to one another, and no 

00:19:51.233 --> 00:19:53.133
one knows exactly how it works.

00:19:53.133 --> 00:19:56.833
But, somehow it joins adjacent
chains with sulfur to make 

00:19:56.833 --> 00:19:59.867
cross-links between these
polymer chains. 

00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:02.367
Probably there are radical
addition reactions to double 

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:05.800
bonds, radical allylic
substitutions, so you get 

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.533
maybe this allylic radical,
which attacks the sulfur, and 

00:20:08.533 --> 00:20:10.867
then that adds to the other
double bond, 

00:20:10.867 --> 00:20:11.600
something like this. 

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.867
But, anyhow, it makes
cross-links in the chains. 

00:20:14.867 --> 00:20:16.667
How does that affect the
physical 

00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:18.033
properties of the polymers? 

00:20:18.033 --> 00:20:20.700
Remember the problem is that it
gets gooey when it's hot, 

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.667
and brittle when it's cold,
which is not what 

00:20:22.667 --> 00:20:24.733
you want in a coat. 

00:20:24.733 --> 00:20:27.967
We're going to study this a
little bit, and we're going to 

00:20:27.967 --> 00:20:32.500
follow a really important
scientist who 

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.167
published this in 1803. 

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:37.367
"A Description of a Property of
Caoutchouc, or Indian 

00:20:37.367 --> 00:20:40.900
Rubber; with some Reflections on
the Cause of Elasticity of 

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.567
this Substance." So this was
done by John 

00:20:43.567 --> 00:20:46.900
Gough, who lived 1757-1825. 

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.633
He was a very interesting
person. 

00:20:48.633 --> 00:20:52.700
He tutored John Dalton for
example, he lived up in the 

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.300
Lake District in England. 

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.500
And Wordsworth wrote of him in
this poem, "Excursion, "No 

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.467
floweret blooms throughout the
lofty range of these rough 

00:21:01.467 --> 00:21:04.200
hills, nor in the woods, that
could from him conceal its 

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.167
birth-place; none whose figure
did not live upon his touch. " 

00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:11.133
"Touch" because when Gough was
three years old, he had 

00:21:11.133 --> 00:21:12.633
rheumatic fever and went blind.

00:21:15.133 --> 00:21:17.867
He was a great scientist, though
blind. So everything he 

00:21:17.867 --> 00:21:21.867
had to do by touch, or
description of someone else. 

00:21:21.867 --> 00:21:26.900
So all these studies of rubber,
he did blind. 

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:27.967
Here's the beginning of this. 

00:21:27.967 --> 00:21:31.400
He lived in Middleshaw House,
near Kendal in 1802. 

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.800
He said, "The substance called
caoutchouc, or Indian Rubber, 

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.233
possesses a singular property;
which, I believe has never 

00:21:37.233 --> 00:21:40.033
been taken notice of in print,
at least by any English 

00:21:40.033 --> 00:21:46.800
Writer." So, here it goes on,
and he says, "I made a piece 

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.067
of caoutchouc a little heavier
than an equal bulk of water, 

00:21:50.067 --> 00:21:52.533
the temperature of which was 45
degrees: the vessel 

00:21:52.533 --> 00:21:55.933
containing the resin and water
was then placed on the fire, 

00:21:55.933 --> 00:21:59.233
and when the contents of it were
heated to 130 degrees, 

00:21:59.233 --> 00:22:02.233
the caoutchouc floated on the
surface." 

00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:06.500
What does that say about the
density of Caoutchouc, and the 

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.800
influence of heat on it? 

00:22:10.833 --> 00:22:11.200
Mary? 

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.067
STUDENT: It got less dense. 

00:22:12.067 --> 00:22:12.967
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:22:12.967 --> 00:22:13.833
STUDENT: It got less dense. 

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:17.200
PROFESSOR: It got less dense,
right? 

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.100
Because you know water gets less
dense 

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.567
when you heat it up. 

00:22:20.567 --> 00:22:25.033
So, when it was cold it sank,
when it was hot it floated. 

00:22:25.033 --> 00:22:29.767
So it must expand, when you heat
it, more than water does. 

00:22:29.767 --> 00:22:33.333
Heating rubber makes it expand
more than water. 

00:22:33.333 --> 00:22:37.100
That's the first. That's not a
great surprise, that's not the 

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:37.667
important thing. 

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:40.033
Experiment one is the important
thing. 

00:22:40.033 --> 00:22:44.867
Here he says, "Hold one end of
the slip, of the rubber, thus 

00:22:44.867 --> 00:22:48.100
prepared, between the thumb and
forefinger of each hand; 

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.733
bring the middle of the piece
into slight contact with the 

00:22:50.733 --> 00:22:54.667
edges of the lips"; because he
has to do it by touch, "taking 

00:22:54.667 --> 00:22:57.100
care to keep it straight all the
time, but not to stretch 

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.967
it much beyond its natural
length: after taking these 

00:22:59.967 --> 00:23:03.600
preparatory steps, extend the
slip suddenly; and you will 

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.267
immediately perceive"--
something. 

00:23:05.267 --> 00:23:07.400
We're going to repeat his thing,
but I need a balloon. 

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.133
Everybody take their balloon,
and we'll do what Gough says 

00:23:13.133 --> 00:23:15.433
to do here. 

00:23:15.433 --> 00:23:17.667
Hold it between your thumb and
finger, and put it against 

00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:22.367
your upper lip, and stretch it a
little bit. 

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:25.200
Now, having stretched it a
little bit, stretch it as hard 

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.233
as you can while it's against
your lip. 

00:23:28.233 --> 00:23:31.600
Do you notice anything? 

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.367
Who's as sensitive as John Gough
here? 

00:23:34.367 --> 00:23:37.400
What happened? 

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.833
What's really interesting is,
you stretch it pretty far and 

00:23:39.833 --> 00:23:44.200
not much happens, but the last
inch makes a difference. 

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.333
You notice that? 

00:23:46.333 --> 00:23:47.333
What happened, Lauren? 

00:23:47.333 --> 00:23:48.933
STUDENT: It just got really
warm. 

00:23:48.933 --> 00:23:51.400
PROFESSOR: It got really warm,
not in the first part of the 

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.867
stretching, but at the very end
of the stretching. 

00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:55.200
Is everybody on to that? 

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.700
Good, so that's what he noticed,
and you can read all 

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.267
that he said here if you want
to. 

00:24:07.267 --> 00:24:10.367
Then, he tries another
experiment here. 

00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:14.067
He says, "If one end of a slip
of Caoutchouc be fastened to a 

00:24:14.067 --> 00:24:17.433
rod of metal or wood, and a
weight be fixed to the other 

00:24:17.433 --> 00:24:20.700
extremity, in order to keep it
in a vertical position," then 

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.933
what will the thong do? 

00:24:21.933 --> 00:24:23.467
So, let's try that one. 

00:24:23.467 --> 00:24:26.700
Here's a piece of caoutchouc. 

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.367
We'll get it so you can see it
here. 

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.800
There, you can see it a little
bit, but 

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.033
we'll need some light. 

00:24:44.333 --> 00:24:46.500
We'll put this on here. 

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.367
We're going to stretch it,
that's what he says to do. 

00:24:56.067 --> 00:25:00.100
I had more, when I tried this, I
had more light before. 

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.500
Let's see if I can do better. 

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:11.733
I'll turn on this light, there
we go, except that the thing 

00:25:11.733 --> 00:25:13.733
is blocking it. 

00:25:19.967 --> 00:25:22.200
I'm getting it into focus. 

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.033
So, I have lines on paper there,
and you can see how 

00:25:25.033 --> 00:25:26.300
much it's stretched. 

00:25:31.067 --> 00:25:35.200
Now, what he's going to do is
heat it. 

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.467
What does caoutchouc do when you
heat it? 

00:25:39.467 --> 00:25:41.200
What's going to happen to the
weight? 

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:47.900
We see the weight just halfway
down below one of those lines. 

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.567
What's going to happen when I
heat it? 

00:25:50.567 --> 00:25:53.767
I'll heat it with this thing. 

00:25:53.767 --> 00:25:54.800
Which way will it move? 

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.933
STUDENT: It will move down. 

00:25:56.933 --> 00:25:59.400
PROFESSOR: It'll expand, right.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.700
So, let's give it a try. 

00:26:14.333 --> 00:26:16.600
Is it going down? 

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.867
Did it do anything? 

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.967
It may be that it's, let me
slide it out a little bit 

00:26:24.967 --> 00:26:27.667
here, so that it's not rubbing
against the rod, there. 

00:26:40.567 --> 00:26:41.600
What do you think? 

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.000
Derek? 

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.400
STUDENT: It shrivels. 

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.767
PROFESSOR: What's going to
happen if I cool it off? 

00:26:47.767 --> 00:26:49.067
STUDENT: It should go back. 

00:26:49.067 --> 00:26:50.733
PROFESSOR: Let's watch. 

00:26:57.233 --> 00:27:10.167
It's expanding when it cools,
and it's contracting slowly 

00:27:10.167 --> 00:27:11.400
when it heats. 

00:27:14.567 --> 00:27:15.833
This is weird, right? 

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.000
It expands when it cools, and
contracts when it heats. 

00:27:25.367 --> 00:27:26.733
We're going to have to deal with
that. 

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.200
Heating a tightly stretched
piece of 

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.467
rubber makes it contract. 

00:27:42.233 --> 00:27:47.033
If stretching rubber generates
heat, that's what we did here. 

00:27:47.033 --> 00:27:48.400
Let's think a second. 

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.833
What's going to happen when it
contracts, if 

00:27:50.833 --> 00:27:52.100
we let it go back? 

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.767
Well, we have several
possibilities. 

00:27:58.767 --> 00:28:01.667
It could be that the heat comes
from friction of the 

00:28:01.667 --> 00:28:04.267
molecules rubbing by one
another. 

00:28:04.267 --> 00:28:05.600
If that's so, what would happen

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.233
when we let it contract? 

00:28:08.233 --> 00:28:08.500
Karl? 

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.233
STUDENT: It heats either way. 

00:28:09.233 --> 00:28:13.100
PROFESSOR: It will heat either
way. 

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.100
On the other hand, if heat comes
from some other cause, 

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.900
contraction may do the opposite
and absorb heat. 

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.200
So, what we're going to do is
stretch our rubber as far as 

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.233
we can and go like this to get
it back to room temperature, 

00:28:26.233 --> 00:28:28.867
while holding it tightly,
tightly stretched because 

00:28:28.867 --> 00:28:31.500
remember this phenomenon happens
only at the very end. 

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.067
Then we're going to put it
against our lip, and do that. 

00:28:39.667 --> 00:28:42.667
What do you find? 

00:28:42.667 --> 00:28:46.567
Which of these is it, one or
two? 

00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:48.200
Did it get hot when it
contracted, 

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.467
or did it get cold? 

00:28:51.967 --> 00:28:55.233
Both, did someone say? 

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:57.000
Cold, OK. 

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.900
That's pretty dramatic, isn't
it? 

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.167
Gough claims to having
discovered this, but in fact, 

00:29:04.167 --> 00:29:05.800
I discovered it. 

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.467
My nephew was having a birthday,
and I was blowing up 

00:29:08.467 --> 00:29:10.067
balloons, and I happened to do
that. 

00:29:10.067 --> 00:29:11.633
I thought, wow, that's really
something. 

00:29:11.633 --> 00:29:12.033
[LAUGHTER] 

00:29:12.033 --> 00:29:15.900
Then I found out I had been
scooped by two centuries. 

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
How does this work? 

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.267
What the heck is going on with
these polymers? 

00:29:23.267 --> 00:29:26.900
Have you been to Yale Health
Center? 

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.367
What do you see, if you go up in
the Yale Health Center and 

00:29:30.367 --> 00:29:31.600
look out toward the campus? 

00:29:34.267 --> 00:29:40.100
This is what you see, a rather
questionable view from the 

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.100
Yale Health Center. 

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.700
But, right here is something
that's very interesting, and 

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.867
if you get up and look at it,
that's the tomb of Charles 

00:29:48.867 --> 00:29:52.833
Goodyear, because he was a
native of New Haven, even 

00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:56.133
though he discovered
vulcanization in Woburn, Mass, 

00:29:56.133 --> 00:29:59.400
and died in New York, a pauper
incidentally. 

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.300
A pauper because he got involved
with lawyers. People 

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.467
tried, everybody and his brother
tried to break his 

00:30:06.467 --> 00:30:09.800
patent. So he hired Daniel
Webster, who was Secretary of 

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.667
State, and put on the most
expensive defense that ever 

00:30:14.667 --> 00:30:17.900
happened of a patent, and still
he lost his shirt. 

00:30:21.067 --> 00:30:26.367
He didn't know how it worked,
but maybe he can find out now, 

00:30:26.367 --> 00:30:30.367
because there he is, and if you
go to that obelisk there, 

00:30:30.367 --> 00:30:33.100
and then down just a little bit
farther, you get to this 

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.333
guy. And that guy could tell
him, probably, and 

00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:40.833
conceivably, did talk to him,
because this is J. Willard 

00:30:40.833 --> 00:30:45.700
Gibbs who got his a Bachelor's
degree at Yale in 1858, so two 

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.667
years before Goodyear died. 

00:30:47.667 --> 00:30:51.000
So they could have met, but I
don't think they did. 

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Gibbs could have given him some
idea about what was going 

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:53.933
on with rubber. 

00:30:53.933 --> 00:30:55.967
But, the persons who really
could have done 

00:30:55.967 --> 00:30:58.500
it, are over here. 

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:03.067
Here are two gravestones that
have different designs, 

00:31:03.067 --> 00:31:05.433
they're both people from this
Chemistry Department. 

00:31:05.433 --> 00:31:08.767
One is John Gamble Kirkwood, who
was a physical chemist and 

00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:11.800
a theorist about polymers. 

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.967
His gravestone tells everything
he did, not 

00:31:15.967 --> 00:31:18.233
everything, but quite a few
things, the awards 

00:31:18.233 --> 00:31:20.267
he got and so on. 

00:31:20.267 --> 00:31:24.300
Next to his, is the tomb of Lars
Onsager, his friend and 

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:31.533
colleague, and his tomb says,
Nobel Laureate. 

00:31:31.533 --> 00:31:35.667
His wife died 15 years later,
and the stone was recarved to 

00:31:35.667 --> 00:31:38.667
put her name on it as well, and
also to put on a footnote. 

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.667
[LAUGHTER] 

00:31:44.667 --> 00:31:47.367
Perhaps they're communing down
there with Goodyear now, and 

00:31:47.367 --> 00:31:49.367
telling him what's going on with
this. 

00:31:49.367 --> 00:31:51.933
It has to do with statistical
mechanics, you remember, 

00:31:51.933 --> 00:31:55.367
that's what Gibbs did, because
statistics is what makes 

00:31:55.367 --> 00:31:58.567
rubber contract after you've
stretched it. 

00:31:58.567 --> 00:32:01.367
If you have a chain all
stretched out like this, 

00:32:01.367 --> 00:32:03.167
there's only one way to arrange
it 

00:32:03.167 --> 00:32:05.800
between the two ends. 

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:11.767
But, if you contract it, like
that, you can have it that 

00:32:11.767 --> 00:32:16.033
way, or that way, or that way,
or that way, or that way. 

00:32:16.033 --> 00:32:18.933
There's a zillion ways to have
it if it's contracted, so 

00:32:18.933 --> 00:32:21.933
statistics, entropy says, it
wants to have a shorter 

00:32:21.933 --> 00:32:25.100
distance between the ends. 

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.633
Even though it might be most
stable, in terms of heat, that 

00:32:28.633 --> 00:32:32.133
is, the best conformation when
it's stretched out, entropy 

00:32:32.133 --> 00:32:34.200
will contract it again. 

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.500
If you have a whole bunch of
these polymer chains, then you 

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.400
start to stretch them out,
they're all tangled around, 

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.500
and as you stretch, they get
more and more parallel to one 

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:51.133
another, and finally, they'll
get so near, some of them will 

00:32:51.133 --> 00:32:55.467
get near one another enough, to
crystallize, just locally. 

00:32:55.467 --> 00:32:57.333
I mean, these aren't like
diamonds, right. 

00:32:57.333 --> 00:33:00.267
But, little local units of the
thing are together, and when 

00:33:00.267 --> 00:33:03.733
they come together like that,
they're lower in energy, so 

00:33:03.733 --> 00:33:05.333
they give off heat. 

00:33:05.333 --> 00:33:08.200
So, when you stretch it, at
first it doesn't make any 

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.800
difference, but the very last
bit of the stretching causes 

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.967
this crystallization, and heat
comes out. 

00:33:15.967 --> 00:33:20.867
There's local crystallization
which contributes rigidity and 

00:33:20.867 --> 00:33:23.700
releases heat. 

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:29.400
On the other hand, if you put
heat in, it will melt these 

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.133
crystals, and entropy will cause
it to contract. 

00:33:36.567 --> 00:33:39.333
So, then it will allow
statistics to make the 

00:33:39.333 --> 00:33:43.300
material contract like this, and
you'll go backwards. 

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.733
So it's actually entropy that
brings rubber back to its 

00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:47.900
original shape. 

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.167
Fixed, irregular cross-links
between adjacent chains 

00:33:55.167 --> 00:33:59.367
prevents crystallization, so it
doesn't become brittle when 

00:33:59.367 --> 00:34:01.133
it's cold, because it doesn't
crystallize. 

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.767
It also prevents it from being
gooey when it's hot. 

00:34:07.767 --> 00:34:08.767
How does that happen? 

00:34:08.767 --> 00:34:13.067
The gooeyness has to do with the
flowing of the molecules, 

00:34:13.067 --> 00:34:15.467
but if you have something that's
all tangled up like 

00:34:15.467 --> 00:34:20.433
this, how can you move a
molecule, if it's got a really 

00:34:20.433 --> 00:34:22.067
complicated shape? 

00:34:22.067 --> 00:34:23.900
The way it happens is very
interesting. 

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.567
It's a process called reptation,
like a reptile. 

00:34:28.567 --> 00:34:31.900
This was an idea of a French
physicist who got the Nobel 

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.000
Prize for this kind of thing. 

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.367
So, suppose you try to move the
chain lengthwise, what 

00:34:40.367 --> 00:34:43.767
will happen is, like a carpet,
when you try to move a carpet, 

00:34:43.767 --> 00:34:47.100
you make a little wiggle in it,
a little hump. 

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.967
Then you could move the hump
along, without moving anything 

00:34:50.967 --> 00:34:54.567
else, and it would go on and on
all along the chain, and 

00:34:54.567 --> 00:34:57.233
finally get to the other end,
where it would be like that, 

00:34:57.233 --> 00:35:01.000
and finally the other end could
move. 

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.967
So, it sort of crawls, or goes
like a snake, through all this 

00:35:05.967 --> 00:35:09.633
tangle of other polymers. 

00:35:09.633 --> 00:35:13.833
What does vulcanization have to
do with that? 

00:35:13.833 --> 00:35:16.833
If you have cross-links between
the chains, then they 

00:35:16.833 --> 00:35:21.533
can't slide by one another, so
you can't do reptation, so the 

00:35:21.533 --> 00:35:26.100
stuff doesn't flow and become
gooey when it's hot. 

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.900
That's what vulcanization does,
so there's no flow when 

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.100
hot, and it inhibits
crystallization, so it's not 

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.133
brittle when it's cold. 

00:35:34.133 --> 00:35:37.500
There's also vulcanization that
happens in the home. 

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.000
As I look around, I'm not sure
that any of you have practiced 

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.967
this, but you've heard of it,
I'm sure. 

00:35:43.967 --> 00:35:46.733
Here's Robin Kelly. 

00:35:46.733 --> 00:35:49.867
I got permission to use this by
talking to Robin Kelly's 

00:35:49.867 --> 00:35:52.367
mother, and she tells me that
Robin Kelly is now a student 

00:35:52.367 --> 00:35:55.600
at Harvard Law School, this was
from some years ago. 

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.300
But, Robin Kelly did Irish
dancing, and she wanted her 

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.600
hair to look like this, for
Irish dancing. 

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.767
So, she vulcanized it. 

00:36:05.767 --> 00:36:09.867
Hair has sulfide groups coming
out, and they link to other 

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:13.967
chains, so it's cross-linked,
it's vulcanized to begin with, 

00:36:13.967 --> 00:36:17.667
that holds the chains next to
one another in shape. 

00:36:17.667 --> 00:36:20.667
So what she did first, was
reduce the disulfide 

00:36:20.667 --> 00:36:27.567
cross-links by excess basic
thiol. 

00:36:27.567 --> 00:36:30.733
These are the two thiols that
are commonly used for that, 

00:36:30.733 --> 00:36:35.000
and notice that the SH is much
more acidic than hydroxide. 

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.100
So if you have basic RSH, you
have RS-. 

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.367
So, that could do an SN2
reaction on sulfur and break 

00:36:45.367 --> 00:36:50.067
that bond, and that one can
attack another thiol, take its 

00:36:50.067 --> 00:36:56.800
hydrogen, and then that thiolate
anion can do another 

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.967
displacement. 

00:36:57.967 --> 00:37:07.067
So what's happened, is that
we've reduced the disulfide 

00:37:07.067 --> 00:37:11.067
links to make it two RSH groups.

00:37:11.067 --> 00:37:15.300
You can do the same thing again,
and again, and again, 

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.200
and now the chains are pliable,
and can be moved past 

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.267
one another. 

00:37:19.267 --> 00:37:22.667
So now she puts the soft spikes
in, and curls her hair 

00:37:22.667 --> 00:37:26.300
up tight, and changes it shape.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.167
Now she's got to make new
cross-links again, to 

00:37:29.167 --> 00:37:33.267
vulcanize it, so she's got it
like this. 

00:37:33.267 --> 00:37:36.567
Now she oxidizes the thiols back
to disulfide with 

00:37:36.567 --> 00:37:38.300
hydrogen peroxide. 

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.867
Now look at the bond
dissociation energies. 

00:37:40.867 --> 00:37:46.767
The OH-OH, remember, the O-O is
a very weak bond, but the S-S 

00:37:46.767 --> 00:37:52.600
bond is not so weak, and S-H
bond is weak, compared to O-H. 

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.400
So, it's much favorable, to
start on the left 

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.300
and go to the right. 

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.333
It's favorable by 30
kilocalories per mole. 

00:37:59.333 --> 00:38:05.700
So, if she puts in peroxide,
with thiol, she'll get out the 

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:09.167
new cross-links and alcohol. 

00:38:09.167 --> 00:38:12.367
So you get the new cross-links
holding the chains together in 

00:38:12.367 --> 00:38:16.167
the shape you want them to be.
So now her hair is vulcanized, 

00:38:16.167 --> 00:38:19.467
and everything's fine, and she
can go Irish dancing. 

00:38:22.067 --> 00:38:24.700
Another way to hold the chains
together with cross-links is 

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.000
to have ionic groups on them. 

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.900
These ions tend to get together
with counterions in 

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.300
clusters, so that serves as a
cross-link, but it's not a 

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:37.333
permanent cross-link the way
covalent bonds are. 

00:38:37.333 --> 00:38:40.667
It's possible, if you warm it,
to break those, and make 

00:38:40.667 --> 00:38:41.433
things flow. 

00:38:41.433 --> 00:38:44.467
This is thermoplastic. You heat
the polymer, and you can 

00:38:44.467 --> 00:38:46.200
reshape it, then you cool it,
and then 

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.767
it's got the new shape. 

00:38:48.767 --> 00:38:51.567
So there's after warming, and
they got malleable 

00:38:51.567 --> 00:38:52.767
cross-links. 

00:38:52.767 --> 00:38:57.800
This is Father Nieuwland at
Notre Dame University, who 

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.600
figured out how to polymerize
not the thing that had methyl 

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.767
up here, which was the
biological isoprene unit, but 

00:39:04.767 --> 00:39:08.367
the one that has chloro, so that
gave a new compound 

00:39:08.367 --> 00:39:11.167
called neoprene, which had
different properties. 

00:39:11.167 --> 00:39:15.267
They're all these different
polymers that have been made, 

00:39:15.267 --> 00:39:19.167
and this list of according to
how much they cost, they get 

00:39:19.167 --> 00:39:22.267
very expensive for
fluorosilicone, how heat 

00:39:22.267 --> 00:39:27.833
resistant they are, at low
temperature, and the maximum 

00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:29.600
temperature you can use them. 

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:34.100
Also, how they last, oxidation,
whether they're 

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.500
subject to weathering by ozone,
how strong they are. 

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.833
So, natural rubber is nice and
strong, it resists abrasion 

00:39:41.833 --> 00:39:46.333
and tear, it's very resilient,
this is after cross-linking 

00:39:46.333 --> 00:39:49.233
it, after vulcanization, but
it's only fair on 

00:39:49.233 --> 00:39:50.600
oxidation or ozone. 

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.933
You've probably seen rubber
that's been around awhile, or 

00:39:52.933 --> 00:39:55.900
old telephone lines, the rubber
is falling off because 

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.333
ozone has gotten to it. 

00:39:58.333 --> 00:40:01.967
They're others that have a
variety of properties, and 

00:40:01.967 --> 00:40:05.067
also an important one that's not
listed here, is how they 

00:40:05.067 --> 00:40:08.133
interact with oil or something
like that. 

00:40:08.133 --> 00:40:11.467
Natural rubber is very bad with
oil, but some of these 

00:40:11.467 --> 00:40:15.833
others, like neoprene is much
better. 

00:40:15.833 --> 00:40:20.300
Designing a tire for your car is
a very complex thing, to 

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.100
mix different polymers to get
exactly the properties in 

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.233
different parts of the tire that
are necessary. 

00:40:26.233 --> 00:40:29.533
There are other ways of doing
polymerization as well, for 

00:40:29.533 --> 00:40:32.533
example, styrene, you could
imagine these double bonds 

00:40:32.533 --> 00:40:34.867
going together with a radical
doing addition 

00:40:34.867 --> 00:40:36.333
to that double bond. 

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:39.700
Notice that as I drew it there,
it's random which end 

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.067
of the styrene got attacked. But
it would also be possible 

00:40:43.067 --> 00:40:45.433
to imagine that it always goes
head to tail, 

00:40:45.433 --> 00:40:46.800
always the same way. 

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.933
Why would that be advantageous,

00:40:48.933 --> 00:40:50.200
always to go this way? 

00:40:55.533 --> 00:40:58.100
Because in fact, that's what it
does. 

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.333
It goes just head to tail. 

00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:01.767
Why? 

00:41:01.767 --> 00:41:04.433
Why don't you do additions like
this, where you add to 

00:41:04.433 --> 00:41:05.900
the center and leave that
radical? 

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:11.433
Why do you want to leave this
radical instead? 

00:41:14.067 --> 00:41:14.500
Amy? 

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.333
STUDENT: It's secondary. 

00:41:15.333 --> 00:41:20.400
PROFESSOR: It's secondary, but
much more important, it's 

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.067
benzylic, it's like allylic. It
has the double bonds to 

00:41:24.067 --> 00:41:26.733
interact with the SOMO. 

00:41:26.733 --> 00:41:28.967
For both reasons it does that,
even if it were a methyl 

00:41:28.967 --> 00:41:31.300
group, it would tend to do this,
because it would be 

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.067
secondary the way Amy said. 

00:41:33.067 --> 00:41:36.533
But with phenyl, it's ever so
much more so, so that's 13 

00:41:36.533 --> 00:41:42.300
kilocalories more stable, than
adding the other way. 

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.300
There's also the question of
tacticity, which 

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.000
we talked on before. 

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.700
You can have isotactic-- 

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:52.767
these are all head to tail,
notice, the methyl group is on 

00:41:52.767 --> 00:41:54.100
every other carbon. 

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.600
But you can have isotactic,
syndiotactic, where isotactic 

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.733
they're all the same,
syndiotactic they alternate, 

00:42:00.733 --> 00:42:02.567
and atactic is random. 

00:42:02.567 --> 00:42:07.633
That's what you get, the
regiochemistry is always head 

00:42:07.633 --> 00:42:10.500
to tail with the free radical,
but the stereochemistry is 

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.567
random, so it's atactic. 

00:42:12.567 --> 00:42:15.400
But, you can get isotactic
polypropylene from 

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:20.200
Ziegler-Natta catalyst, that we
talked about last lecture 

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.100
or the lecture before and
syndiotactic, remember, if use 

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.967
this fancy Kaminsky catalyst,
that comes from one side, then 

00:42:26.967 --> 00:42:28.867
the other, then one side, and
then the other, and it has a 

00:42:28.867 --> 00:42:34.067
mirror plane, so you change the
configuration each time. 

00:42:34.067 --> 00:42:37.200
There's another question of
selectivity when you have two 

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.333
different monomers in there, for
example methyl 

00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:44.133
methacrylate and styrene. So you
could have block 

00:42:44.133 --> 00:42:47.067
copolymers, where you have a
bunch of one coming together, 

00:42:47.067 --> 00:42:51.500
and then a bunch of the other
one in a single chain. 

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.000
Another possibility is to have
them strictly alternate, A B A 

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.300
B A B, and you can do that. And
the reason you can do it, 

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.867
is because of the rates of
adding different radicals to 

00:43:03.867 --> 00:43:05.500
the alkenes. 

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.033
So, if you have that particular
radical at the end 

00:43:08.033 --> 00:43:13.533
of the chain, it adds to styrene
faster than it adds to 

00:43:13.533 --> 00:43:15.667
methyl methacrylate. 

00:43:15.667 --> 00:43:18.500
This unit here was methyl
methacrylate that added to a 

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.667
radical there, so now it's at
the end of the chain, and it 

00:43:21.667 --> 00:43:25.267
would prefer by a factor of two
to one to react with its 

00:43:25.267 --> 00:43:29.067
own kind, pardon me, to react
with styrene rather than with 

00:43:29.067 --> 00:43:31.633
it's own kind. 

00:43:31.633 --> 00:43:33.567
What would you expect if you
have 

00:43:33.567 --> 00:43:37.467
styrene as the last radical? 

00:43:37.467 --> 00:43:39.400
Notice what's interesting, here.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.167
I was wondering what this one
was here, it's this. 

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.700
Now notice it's a factor of two
in the other direction. 

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.300
One radical-- 

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.700
each radical, prefers to react
with the other monomer, isn't 

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.333
that interesting. 

00:43:57.333 --> 00:44:00.800
That's why it goes A B A B A B.
Why should that be? 

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.967
This isn't surprising, because
this radical is resonance- 

00:44:04.967 --> 00:44:09.167
stabilized as Amy was telling
us. 

00:44:09.167 --> 00:44:11.933
That's the fastest of all these
reactions, and it's a 

00:44:11.933 --> 00:44:13.867
good radical, so that's
reasonable. 

00:44:13.867 --> 00:44:17.400
But why does this one prefer not
to form the good radical, 

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.767
but to form what appears to be
the less good radical? 

00:44:21.767 --> 00:44:27.233
Here's our radical starting, and
it can add to this, to 

00:44:27.233 --> 00:44:31.100
give that, and that turns out it
would be something like 

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.633
that, and it's 20 kilocalories
per mole exothermic. 

00:44:36.633 --> 00:44:43.300
If we react with the other
alkene, then it gives this, 

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.900
which is less stable. 

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.933
This one doesn't have as much
allylic or benzylic 

00:44:48.933 --> 00:44:52.933
stabilization that you have down
here. 

00:44:52.933 --> 00:44:54.167
But, it's faster. 

00:44:58.333 --> 00:45:00.967
So it's faster to go to the
higher-energy product. That's 

00:45:00.967 --> 00:45:04.033
not the Hammond postulate,
right? 

00:45:04.033 --> 00:45:05.100
Why? 

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:09.333
Why is it twice as fast to go to
the less stable product? 

00:45:09.333 --> 00:45:12.433
The transition state for one
looks like that, the 

00:45:12.433 --> 00:45:16.000
transition state for the other
looks like that. 

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.033
What's good about the bottom
one? 

00:45:19.033 --> 00:45:22.467
There's the top one, there's the
bottom one, and notice in 

00:45:22.467 --> 00:45:28.633
this one the carbonyl is good at
stabilizing high HOMOs. 

00:45:28.633 --> 00:45:31.367
So, you could have a resonance
structure with a minus charge 

00:45:31.367 --> 00:45:33.800
here, and a plus charge here. 

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.967
You can't do that up here as
well, this isn't specifically 

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:40.500
good at stabilizing anions. 

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.633
So you could have these
resonance structures here, 

00:45:42.633 --> 00:45:44.033
that you can't have there. 

00:45:47.367 --> 00:45:49.800
So, the ionic resonance
structure, you could say, 

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.467
stabilizes the transition state,
or if you wanted to 

00:45:52.467 --> 00:45:55.367
talk about it in terms of
orbitals, you'd say that the C 

00:45:55.367 --> 00:45:58.200
double bond O gives an unusually
low LUMO, so that's 

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.467
good when the SOMO is not so
low. 

00:46:02.467 --> 00:46:06.033
This special stability applies
only at the transition state. 

00:46:06.033 --> 00:46:08.500
Once you've formed this bond,
then you can't have a 

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.267
resonance structure like that. 

00:46:11.267 --> 00:46:14.333
The product is not stabilized by
that kind of thing, but the 

00:46:14.333 --> 00:46:16.933
transition state is, which is
what makes these things turn 

00:46:16.933 --> 00:46:23.067
around and go A B A B A B. OK,
now I was going to go on to 

00:46:23.067 --> 00:46:26.067
acetylenes, but we'll do that
next time.

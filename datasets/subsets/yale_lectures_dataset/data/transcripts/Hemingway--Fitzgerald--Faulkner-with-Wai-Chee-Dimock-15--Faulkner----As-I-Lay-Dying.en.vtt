00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.133
WAI CHEE DIMOCK: OK, so I just
want to go back very briefly

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:10.533
to our approach to
As I Lay Dying.

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:14.133
Last time we talked about the
importance of the epic

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:21.233
tradition to the modernist
novel, especially the way that

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:25.200
the voice of the dead and
certain boundaries between the

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.767
human and the non-human are
being reactivated and

00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:33.133
redeployed in As I Lay Dying.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.067
So today, we're going
to move on to a

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:37.233
somewhat different approach.

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:39.333
This is really a different
way to

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.233
contextualize As I Lay Dying.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:45.100
And it's more of a kind
of an American

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.733
tradition for this novel.

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:51.933
And in fact, we already begin to
see a little of that in the

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:56.867
person who is in one sense a
key player but in another

00:00:56.867 --> 00:00:58.933
sense not--

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:02.967
Addie's partner in the
adulterous affair.

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:09.167
And Faulkner takes the name of
that person from a historic

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:13.133
figure, a very well known 18th
century preacher, George

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.733
Whitfield, someone who actually
has a large presence

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:20.233
in Benjamin Franklin's
autobiography.

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:23.800
So this is the very
dignified looking

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.400
historical George Whitfield.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.967
And this is Faulkner's
Whitfield.

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:33.933
When he was on his horse, he was
able to cross the river,

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.500
as we know.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.400
And he's on his way.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.600
In fact, he's approaching
us right at the house.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.633
So Whitfield has a lot
to be thankful for.

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:50.033
And he's expressing
his gratitude

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.833
to God at this moment.

00:01:52.833 --> 00:01:57.567
"It was He in His infinite
wisdom that restrained the

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:03.200
tale from her dying lips as she
lay surrounded by those

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.167
who loved and trusted her;
mine the travail by water

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:12.500
which I sustain by the
strength of His hand.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.500
Praise to Thee in Thy bounteous
and omnipotent love;

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.767
O praise."

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:24.033
Yes, he truly is a
very lucky guy.

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:26.500
She dies before she is able
to give away his name.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.667
Maybe she never plans on it.

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:31.967
She's too proud and never wanted
to give away his name.

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:34.533
So he's lucky in having chosen
the right partner.

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:39.367
Someone whose lips are sealed
when it comes to his name.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:43.067
And he's also very lucky in the
sense that this horse is

00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:46.067
such a good swimmer.

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:48.867
The horse is able to cross the
river when the mules drown.

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:53.667
He's truly a blessed figure.

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:58.633
But of course, I'm making fun
of him as indeed I think

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:01.800
Faulkner wants us to.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.133
The only way I think to take
someone like Whitfield is to

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:07.767
put him in one particular
genre.

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:11.600
And this is really what I'd
like to argue today is the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.567
question of genre for
As I Lay Dying.

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:20.567
The only way to take Whitfield
is to put him in

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:21.733
the genre of comedy.

00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:24.433
And he's just a comic figure.

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.467
He's totally serious himself.

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:29.900
He's congratulating himself and
he's praising the Lord.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.500
But all the time that he's
doing that, he's firmly

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.533
ensconced in the comic
tradition.

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:42.933
And it turns out that this
self-congratulating

00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:48.167
self-dignifying kind of person
actually has a precedent in

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:51.800
America literature, a very
prominent precedent.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.600
And it turns out that this
predecessor is also a minister

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.067
who has an affair
with a woman.

00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:04.200
So there's only one novel
in American literature

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.500
that is like that.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.967
And not surprisingly, it's a
novel that we all recognize,

00:04:09.967 --> 00:04:11.700
The Scarlet Letter.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.767
So this is Hawthorne's
comic figure.

00:04:16.767 --> 00:04:19.167
The Scarlet Letter is
not really usually

00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:21.667
read as a comic novel.

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:24.200
Like do you think that Hawthorne
has had more fun

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.700
when he's portraying
Arthur Dimmesdale?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.533
"God knows; and he
is merciful!

00:04:29.533 --> 00:04:33.633
He hath proved his mercy most
of all, in my afflictions.

00:04:33.633 --> 00:04:35.967
By giving me this burning
torture to

00:04:35.967 --> 00:04:37.667
bear upon my breast...

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:38.733
Praised be his name!

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:40.367
His will be done!

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:42.200
Farewell."

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.933
Exactly the same combination, a
woman whose lips are sealed,

00:04:46.933 --> 00:04:50.867
would never give away the
name of her partner.

00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:56.467
And the same kind of mercy in
quotation marks from God.

00:04:56.467 --> 00:04:59.367
In this case, Arthur Dimmesdale
is lucky.

00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:03.000
Not in the sense that he has a
horse who's a good swimmer,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.800
but in a sense that he dies
right at that moment.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.967
At the very moment when he's
thanking God and he is

00:05:13.967 --> 00:05:16.567
forgiven, his sins are
forgiven, he dies.

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:20.300
So he is very lucky
in that way.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.733
And it suggests that from the
very beginning, from the

00:05:25.733 --> 00:05:30.367
nineteenth century on, a story
that otherwise would have been

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:36.567
taken as tragic actually has
a comic dimension to it.

00:05:36.567 --> 00:05:42.833
It's just not very easy to roll
our eyes when we listen

00:05:42.833 --> 00:05:46.567
to someone like Whitfield and
when we listen to someone like

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:48.567
Arthur Dimmesdale.

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:53.733
But even as we're rolling our
eyes, I think that there are

00:05:53.733 --> 00:05:56.933
other things in those two novels
that is very hard to

00:05:56.933 --> 00:05:58.467
roll our eyes over.

00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:02.067
So I want to turn now to
this other dimension.

00:06:02.067 --> 00:06:05.433
And I want to begin with
Hawthorne by talking about,

00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:09.567
honestly, the much more
important, tragic dimension in

00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:14.067
The Scarlet Letter and it's
on Hester Prynne.

00:06:14.067 --> 00:06:16.167
"The fact of the symbol--

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:20.967
or rather, of the position in
respect to society that was

00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:22.933
indicated by it--

00:06:22.933 --> 00:06:25.633
on the mind of Hester
Prynne herself was

00:06:25.633 --> 00:06:28.400
powerful and peculiar.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.567
All the light and graceful
foliage of her character had

00:06:32.567 --> 00:06:36.500
been withered up by this red-hot
brand, and had long

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.133
ago fallen away, leaving a bare
and harsh outline which

00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:46.633
might have been repulsive, had
she possessed friends or

00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:50.367
companions to be repelled
by it."

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:57.000
So just as Dimmesdale and
Whitfield are doubly lucky,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.167
Hester Prynne is
doubly cursed.

00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:04.900
She's cursed both in the most
obvious way, because she has

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.700
to wear the scarlet letter
for the rest of her life.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.667
And she's also cursed--

00:07:10.667 --> 00:07:12.500
well, she's actually
triply cursed.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.733
She has to wear the
scarlet letter.

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:15.600
Her whole being is
transformed.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.433
So all the physical beauty or
the beauty of her mind seemed

00:07:21.433 --> 00:07:23.133
to have gone away.

00:07:23.133 --> 00:07:27.533
And she's just this very harsh,
forbidding character.

00:07:27.533 --> 00:07:30.600
And that other people might have
found repulsive, if she

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.033
had friends to be repelled by.

00:07:33.033 --> 00:07:37.433
So really, she's an absolute
have not at this point.

00:07:37.433 --> 00:07:39.867
Although Hawthorne, as you
guys know who've read The

00:07:39.867 --> 00:07:42.167
Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne
actually qualifies that this

00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:44.233
isn't quite the absolute ending
of The Scarlet Letter.

00:07:44.233 --> 00:07:45.833
It's quite early.

00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:49.700
So this is a kind of low point,
absolute low point, the

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.567
most tragic moment for Hester
in The Scarlet Letter.

00:07:53.567 --> 00:08:00.767
And I want to turn now from
Hester to the comparable

00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:04.200
figure in Faulkner's
As I Lay Dying.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.933
And obviously, it is Addie.

00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:09.200
And she's especially tragic
in relation to the

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.033
two men in her life.

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:15.733
First of all, her relation
to Whitfield.

00:08:15.733 --> 00:08:19.867
"While I waited for him in the
woods, waiting for him before

00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:24.067
he saw me, I would think of
him as dressed in sin.

00:08:24.067 --> 00:08:27.633
I would think of him as thinking
of me as dressed also

00:08:27.633 --> 00:08:32.200
in sin, he the more beautiful
since the garment in which he

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.700
exchanged for sin
was sanctified.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.733
I would think of the sin as
garments which we would remove

00:08:39.733 --> 00:08:44.100
in order to shape and coerce
the terrible blood to the

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:49.467
forlorn echo of the dead
word high in the air."

00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:54.700
This is about as joyless
a description

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.033
of any kind of romance.

00:08:57.033 --> 00:08:58.133
It's not even a romance.

00:08:58.133 --> 00:09:00.500
It's not adultery.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.333
There's no sex, obviously,
in As I Lay Dying.

00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:07.300
There's almost no love.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:13.633
It is just the whole act
itself is coercing "the

00:09:13.633 --> 00:09:21.433
terrible blood to a forlorn
echo of the dead... air."

00:09:21.433 --> 00:09:23.800
It's hard to understand why
anyone would even want to do

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.300
that if that is the nature
of the affair.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.167
But that's how Faulkner would
like us to think of that

00:09:30.167 --> 00:09:34.533
affair between Addie
and Whitfield.

00:09:34.533 --> 00:09:39.233
And we can almost sort of see
why she would be so forlorn,

00:09:39.233 --> 00:09:42.433
because the fact that he's
congratulating himself and

00:09:42.433 --> 00:09:45.300
because he's counting himself
lucky at the moment of her

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.633
death suggests what kind
of a lover he has been.

00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:52.300
So maybe it's not surprising
that she should have been

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.967
forlorn all the way through.

00:09:54.967 --> 00:09:58.267
And it is also the
case that she's

00:09:58.267 --> 00:10:01.733
forlorn for another reason.

00:10:01.733 --> 00:10:05.100
And maybe that's why she got
into the affair to begin with.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.833
Her relation to her husband.

00:10:06.833 --> 00:10:09.800
"...and I would think, Anse.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.800
Why Anse.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.400
Why are you Anse.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.433
I would think about his name
until after a while I could

00:10:16.433 --> 00:10:20.833
see the word as a shape, a
vessel, and I would watch him

00:10:20.833 --> 00:10:26.133
liquefy and flow into it like
cold molasses flowing out of

00:10:26.133 --> 00:10:31.067
the darkness into the vessel
until the jar stood full and

00:10:31.067 --> 00:10:36.233
motionless, a significant shape
profoundly without life

00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:39.767
like an empty door frame."

00:10:39.767 --> 00:10:45.033
It's one of the most memorable
descriptions of a terrible

00:10:45.033 --> 00:10:47.867
marriage, unbearable marriage.

00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:51.667
And I think that that
says it all.

00:10:51.667 --> 00:10:56.767
It doesn't exactly justify
Addie's action if it needs

00:10:56.767 --> 00:10:58.133
justification.

00:10:58.133 --> 00:11:01.367
But it really explains a lot.

00:11:01.367 --> 00:11:07.900
And it's in contrast that to
that cold molasses in a jar

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.533
that all of a sudden, we
see another marriage in

00:11:11.533 --> 00:11:11.933
perspective.

00:11:11.933 --> 00:11:16.067
So I just want to refresh your
memory about what we saw last

00:11:16.067 --> 00:11:18.700
time about Tull and Cora.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.733
"...because it would take a
tight house for Cora, to hold

00:11:21.733 --> 00:11:25.600
Cora like a jar of milk in the
spring, you've got to have a

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.367
tight jar or you need a powerful
spring, so if you

00:11:28.367 --> 00:11:31.633
have a big spring, why then you
have the incentive to have

00:11:31.633 --> 00:11:35.633
tight well made jars, because it
is your milk, sour or not,

00:11:35.633 --> 00:11:38.200
because you would rather have
milk that will sour than to

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.167
have milk that won't, because
you are a man..."

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:44.033
So it's not a spectacular
marriage

00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:45.767
or this good marriage.

00:11:45.767 --> 00:11:50.867
And it's a marriage that makes
Tull feel like a man and

00:11:50.867 --> 00:11:53.067
probably Cora like a woman.

00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:59.200
I don't mean to be sexist. Just
the general description

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.733
of a good marriage.

00:12:00.733 --> 00:12:13.167
So here's Tull and Cora as a
foil really to Addie and Anse.

00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:18.400
So it seems that right now we've
seen Addie mostly as a

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:24.633
tragic figure in relation to her
two men and as a kind of a

00:12:24.633 --> 00:12:29.900
descendant, twentieth century
descendant of Hester Prynne.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.433
But given the precedent of
Hawthorne, given that there's

00:12:33.433 --> 00:12:39.267
really a comic dimension, even
in the most tragic tale, we

00:12:39.267 --> 00:12:42.933
shouldn't be surprised that
there would also be a

00:12:42.933 --> 00:12:47.900
comparable comic dimension in
As I Lay Dying as well.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.167
So I like to read the whole
novel as, in some sense, a

00:12:51.167 --> 00:12:56.367
kind of constant negotiation
between those two poles,

00:12:56.367 --> 00:12:58.600
between the comic pole -- comedy
on the one hand and

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.667
tragedy on the other.

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:06.700
And we can see the comedy coming
in Addie's relation to

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.300
her son, Vardaman, who's
not quite fully

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.700
retarded as Benjy is.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.067
But Faulkner is really
interested in the slightly

00:13:16.067 --> 00:13:16.933
retarded mind.

00:13:16.933 --> 00:13:19.900
So Vardaman seems to be
an instance of that.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.500
And it comes out in statements
like "my mother is a fish."

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.433
I think that along with "Call
me Ishmael," "My mother is a

00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:27.600
fish " has got to be one of
the most famous lines in

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.867
American literature.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.433
So this brings us back to the
human and the non-human.

00:13:35.433 --> 00:13:40.067
But it also now suggests another
dimension, a generic

00:13:40.067 --> 00:13:45.067
dimension, to Addie
being a fish.

00:13:45.067 --> 00:13:49.767
And it turns out that she's not
just any kind of a fish,

00:13:49.767 --> 00:13:53.800
but she's a fish out of water,
which is, I guess, a comic

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.800
restatement of the sense of
desolation and the forlornness

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.400
that she feels towards Whitfield
and towards Anse.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.933
It is exactly the same thing,
except that when we say that

00:14:05.933 --> 00:14:08.333
she's a fish out of water,
there's a complete different

00:14:08.333 --> 00:14:09.967
set of connotations.

00:14:09.967 --> 00:14:15.933
So this is Vardaman reporting
on this fish that he just

00:14:15.933 --> 00:14:19.700
picked up, dead fish already
dead that he's chopping up.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.467
Oh, sorry.

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:31.667
This is actually
Darl reporting.

00:14:31.667 --> 00:14:33.233
"'You clean it,' Anse said.

00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:34.433
He don't look around.

00:14:34.433 --> 00:14:37.233
Vardaman comes back and
picks up the fish.

00:14:37.233 --> 00:14:41.567
It slides out of his hands,
smearing wet dirt on to him,

00:14:41.567 --> 00:14:45.567
and flops down, dirtying
itself, gapmouthed,

00:14:45.567 --> 00:14:49.700
goggle-eyed, hiding into the
dust like it was ashamed of

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:55.600
being dead, like it was in a
hurry to get back hid again."

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.767
So along with the sense that
Addie is a misfit that is

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:06.000
completely alone and by herself,
even in a marriage

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.967
and even in an adulterous
affair, there's this

00:15:09.967 --> 00:15:13.800
additional element that she's
ashamed of all of it.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:21.700
And we can see that shame in her
reaction to the horse that

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.667
Jewel acquires.

00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:24.600
She's proud.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.700
She is proud, but she's
also crying.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.267
And Darl realizes that
she's ashamed of her

00:15:31.267 --> 00:15:33.400
deceit at that moment.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:40.367
So there's this terrible shame
that's going to accompany her

00:15:40.367 --> 00:15:41.600
in her death.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.733
And in the fish, it comes out
as the fish being ashamed of

00:15:45.733 --> 00:15:50.233
being dead, even though
that's not a condition

00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:51.867
that we could help.

00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:55.300
But nonetheless, this fish seems
really ashamed of this

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.533
elemental fact.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.867
Actually, just to stop
for a moment.

00:16:04.867 --> 00:16:09.600
The fish actually would be a
great paper topic for your

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.500
final paper.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.033
And it would bring Hemingway
and Faulkner together in a

00:16:16.033 --> 00:16:18.167
really interesting way.

00:16:18.167 --> 00:16:22.767
So once again, I want to
reemphasize how interesting it

00:16:22.767 --> 00:16:25.700
might be to pick something that
is peripheral, not a key

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.267
player, but interesting entry
point into novels.

00:16:29.267 --> 00:16:34.067
So in thinking along those
lines, we can go back to the

00:16:34.067 --> 00:16:37.000
fish in In Our Time.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.600
And it's a dead fish,
two dead fish.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.233
But totally different set of
connotations that Hemingway

00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:47.233
brings to the dead trout.

00:16:47.233 --> 00:16:51.800
"Nick cleaned them, slitting
them from the vent to the tip

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.933
of the jaw.

00:16:52.933 --> 00:16:56.567
All the insides and the
gills and tongue

00:16:56.567 --> 00:16:58.667
came out in one piece.

00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:03.233
They were both males, long,
gray-white strips of milt,

00:17:03.233 --> 00:17:05.033
smooth and clean.

00:17:05.033 --> 00:17:09.100
All the insides clean and
compact, coming out all

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.233
together."

00:17:10.233 --> 00:17:15.200
So this is Hemmingway's
idea of a good death.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.433
It's the death of human beings
being actually prefigured or

00:17:20.433 --> 00:17:26.033
maybe encoded into this very
clean, very dignified

00:17:26.033 --> 00:17:26.733
death of the fish.

00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:30.000
There's no way we
can avoid dying.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.900
But the least that we can ask
for is that we should die in a

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:41.433
manner that is fitting for men
that is commensurate with the

00:17:41.433 --> 00:17:43.233
way that we've lived.

00:17:43.233 --> 00:17:47.867
And the trout has lived a very
clean life -- it's an

00:17:47.867 --> 00:17:49.000
important word to Hemingway --

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.700
has lived a very clean
life in the water.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.000
So it is fitting that
the death should be

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.133
commensurate with that.

00:17:56.133 --> 00:18:01.600
And that is really a kind of
Utopian moment in Hemingway.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:08.000
And in contrast, this dirty
fish out of water being

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.100
ashamed unto death is a
dystopian moment in Faulkner.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.400
But it's also a comic
moment as well.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.733
So I wish to say that comedy's
obviously a very complicated

00:18:19.733 --> 00:18:23.433
and packed and in many
ways contradictory

00:18:23.433 --> 00:18:25.467
phenomenon in Faulkner.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.700
And it's with that
understanding--

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.600
comedy in quotation marks-- in
many ways, that I like to

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.467
think about the whole structure
of As I Lay Dying as

00:18:39.467 --> 00:18:43.000
negotiation between comedy
and tragedy.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.333
And I like to bring up three
sets of terms that we've been

00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:50.467
talking about all through the
semester to see how comedy and

00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:53.433
tragedy get mapped
onto these times.

00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:56.133
One is the human and non-human
that we've been

00:18:56.133 --> 00:18:58.100
talking about last time.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.267
And then I want to bring
Hemingway back.

00:19:01.267 --> 00:19:05.567
In turns out that the two
categories, the have and have

00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:10.067
not, set up by Hemingway will
be key actually, in the rest

00:19:10.067 --> 00:19:12.133
of the novels that
we'll be reading.

00:19:12.133 --> 00:19:16.567
So we're using have and have not
as key terms within there

00:19:16.567 --> 00:19:22.600
as a very useful analytic
paradigm and related to those.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.600
Since we've been talking so much
about kinship, beginning

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.533
with The Sound and the
Fury and also now As

00:19:28.533 --> 00:19:31.000
I Lay Dying, brothers.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.233
Who is a kin and who
is a non-kin?

00:19:34.233 --> 00:19:38.200
Last time we saw that Jewel is
in danger of being labeled

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:43.433
non-kin by his brother Darl and
by his sister, Dewey Dell.

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.733
So who is going to
be a non-kin at

00:19:45.733 --> 00:19:48.267
the end of this novel?

00:19:48.267 --> 00:19:54.000
But first, let's start out with
the most obvious comic

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.900
feature of As I Lay Dying, which
is the most conventional

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.100
ending, happy ending
in marriage.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.900
And if you guys haven't gotten
to that point, I apologize.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.933
But there's no way to talk about
it as comedy without

00:20:07.933 --> 00:20:10.767
talking about the very
last thing that we

00:20:10.767 --> 00:20:13.667
see in As I Lay Dying.

00:20:13.667 --> 00:20:18.400
"'It is Cash and Jewel and
Vardaman and Dewey Dell, ' pa

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.600
says, kind of hangdog and proud
too, with his teeth and

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.367
all, even as he wouldn't
look at it.

00:20:26.367 --> 00:20:28.433
'Meet Mrs. Bundren.'"

00:20:28.433 --> 00:20:34.367
So his wife isn't quite
in the ground.

00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:40.300
And this is a very fast mover,
so he has acquired a new wife

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.667
and other possessions, where
he has teeth and so on.

00:20:44.667 --> 00:20:48.667
This is a new feature on Anse.

00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:53.600
So this is sort of the cliched
ending for comedy.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.433
You've got to have a marriage
and Faulkner very obligingly

00:20:57.433 --> 00:21:01.600
gives us a marriage at the
end of As I Lay Dying.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.800
But we just know that
he's going to

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.633
qualify it in some fashion.

00:21:05.633 --> 00:21:12.900
So right before we see Anse with
his new wife and his new

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.333
teeth, we see something
else and that is just

00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:18.700
taking one step back.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.167
"'Who's that? ' Then we see it
wasn't the grip that made him

00:21:23.167 --> 00:21:27.167
look different; it was his face,
and Jewel says, He got

00:21:27.167 --> 00:21:29.967
them teeth.' It was a fact.

00:21:29.967 --> 00:21:33.000
It made him look a foot taller,
kind of holding his

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.900
head up, hangdog and proud
too, and then we see her

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.933
behind him, carrying
the other grip--

00:21:39.933 --> 00:21:44.167
a kind of duck-shaped woman
all dressed up.

00:21:44.167 --> 00:21:47.533
And then I see that the grip
she was carrying was one of

00:21:47.533 --> 00:21:49.833
them little graphophones.

00:21:49.833 --> 00:21:56.133
It was a fact; all shut up and
pretty as a picture, and every

00:21:56.133 --> 00:21:59.533
time a new record would come
from the mail order and us

00:21:59.533 --> 00:22:03.500
sitting in the house in the
window listening to it, I

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:09.667
would think what a shame Darl
couldn't be to enjoy it too."

00:22:09.667 --> 00:22:14.000
So a lot of information is
coming at us at this moment.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.033
New teeth, another possession
records for a gramophone.

00:22:20.033 --> 00:22:25.400
And the new phenomenon of
records coming by mail order.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.600
This is truly the twentieth
century.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.600
Even though there's still mules,
we're firmly in the

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.900
twentieth century.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:39.600
And the crucial little detail at
the end that Darl won't be

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.867
there to enjoy the records.

00:22:42.867 --> 00:22:47.367
So we know right there-- this is
the very end, this is 260--

00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:50.467
so we know already what
has happened to Darl.

00:22:50.467 --> 00:22:53.600
But it's just repeating what
-- we have no pride

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.467
in this moment --

00:22:55.467 --> 00:23:00.433
that this is reconstituting
of the Bundren family.

00:23:00.433 --> 00:23:07.700
That one person is no longer
kin, no longer in that family.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.433
So how does this happen is what
we need to find out. and

00:23:11.433 --> 00:23:16.000
we have to go back a few steps
to find out how it is that

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.667
Darl gets excluded from
that family circle.

00:23:21.667 --> 00:23:23.933
But I just want to give you
a couple of images why the

00:23:23.933 --> 00:23:27.367
gramophone would be such a
desirable object, just like

00:23:27.367 --> 00:23:28.500
the telephone.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.800
All this new equipment is just
incredibly glamorous when they

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.267
first appear.

00:23:34.267 --> 00:23:36.500
So this is Columbia
gramophone.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.467
And I'd like to, since we have
all these desirable objects

00:23:41.467 --> 00:23:49.033
here, is obviously As I Lay
Dying is Faulkner's version of

00:23:49.033 --> 00:23:51.300
To Have and Have Not.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:57.067
And right there we know that
Anse has three very prized

00:23:57.067 --> 00:24:02.100
possessions, teeth, wife
and gramophone.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.233
And it seems that in contrast,
other people

00:24:05.233 --> 00:24:07.800
have all lost something.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:14.100
They all have been reclassified
in some sense as

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:14.867
"have nots."

00:24:14.867 --> 00:24:20.267
So in many ways, this is a
zero sum game in As I Lay

00:24:20.267 --> 00:24:25.367
Dying that one person gets a lot
of stuff at the expense of

00:24:25.367 --> 00:24:26.033
someone else.

00:24:26.033 --> 00:24:31.767
It's a very austere economic
model that there's no pure

00:24:31.767 --> 00:24:33.367
gain in this world.

00:24:33.367 --> 00:24:37.200
Someone gains something, someone
loses something.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.567
And the three people who lose
something in the course of

00:24:41.567 --> 00:24:44.767
Anse acquiring so much
are his three sons,

00:24:44.767 --> 00:24:47.500
Cash, Jewel and Darl.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.433
So let's just look at Cash.

00:24:50.433 --> 00:24:55.500
And this is not really related
to anything that I've been

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.333
saying so far.

00:24:56.333 --> 00:24:58.633
But it's clearly
Cash and Jewel.

00:24:58.633 --> 00:25:02.700
Cash is the petty cash, and
Jewel is the one whose value

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.400
cannot be reckoned by cash.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.333
So Faulkner's really playing
with the economic

00:25:08.333 --> 00:25:09.267
model in a big way.

00:25:09.267 --> 00:25:12.633
So maybe it's not surprising
that it would also be a kind

00:25:12.633 --> 00:25:17.067
of economic logic that's
determining the narrative

00:25:17.067 --> 00:25:19.400
logic in As I Lay
Dying as well.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.633
But Cash being named after petty
cash, he's one who would

00:25:24.633 --> 00:25:30.500
go try to make $3 at the risk of
not seeing his mother when

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.600
she dies, not being with his
mother when she dies.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.967
So petty cash.

00:25:34.967 --> 00:25:42.833
But even though his being is
measured by petty cash, even

00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:47.633
in spite of that, he can't
always hold on to what he

00:25:47.633 --> 00:25:53.767
has-- the little he does have
initially starting out.

00:25:53.767 --> 00:25:57.400
"His face turned up a second
when he was sliding

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.467
back into the water.

00:25:59.467 --> 00:26:03.900
It was gray, with his eyes
closed and a long swipe of mud

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.000
across his face.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.600
Then he let go and turned
over in the water.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.500
He looked just like an old
bundle of clothes kind of

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.800
washing up and down
against the bank.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.300
He looked like he was still
laying there in water on his

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.467
face, rocking up and down a
little, looking at something

00:26:24.467 --> 00:26:27.400
at the bottom."

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.067
So Cash is momentarily
non-human.

00:26:31.067 --> 00:26:33.133
He's lost his humanity.

00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:37.067
He looks like a bundle
of old clothes.

00:26:37.067 --> 00:26:40.333
And we can all do that.

00:26:40.333 --> 00:26:46.233
If we're floating the river
unconscious, we can look like

00:26:46.233 --> 00:26:49.400
we're inanimate matter,
which is what

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.000
Cash is at this moment.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.300
He could be inanimate matter,
like a bundle of old clothes.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.467
Or we can also think about
different kind of a kinship

00:27:00.467 --> 00:27:02.033
that is snapping in place.

00:27:02.033 --> 00:27:06.600
Because actually Faulkner makes
sure that we have a

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.167
vivid memory of something else
that also floated before

00:27:10.167 --> 00:27:12.633
lifeless in the water.

00:27:12.633 --> 00:27:16.333
"Between the two hills, I
see the mules once more.

00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:19.600
They roll up out of the water
in succession turning

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.433
completely over, their legs
stiffly extended as when they

00:27:24.433 --> 00:27:26.633
had lost contact with
the earth."

00:27:26.633 --> 00:27:29.200
So the mules are floating
belly-up, their

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.067
legs stiffly extended.

00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:35.667
That's a kind of a natural
posture for them.

00:27:35.667 --> 00:27:39.000
And Cash is floating face down
where he's looking at

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.633
something at the bottom
of the river.

00:27:41.633 --> 00:27:45.367
But either way, the two
postures are almost

00:27:45.367 --> 00:27:50.167
symmetrical in a sense that both
the mules and Cash are

00:27:50.167 --> 00:27:56.333
reduced to inanimate matter
in that kind of posture.

00:27:56.333 --> 00:28:01.800
And we know that the mules
are emblems for Tull.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.433
And they're also emblems for--

00:28:05.433 --> 00:28:07.500
it's not cow, it's Cash--

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:14.367
it's for Cash's kinship, that
he too is a creature

00:28:14.367 --> 00:28:16.100
with feet of clay.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:22.300
So this is reaffirming the fact
that he's not capable of

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:22.900
lots of things.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.400
He's a very good carpenter,
but he's not capable of

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.000
surviving in hostile
environment, and the water is

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.433
one of them.

00:28:31.433 --> 00:28:36.800
So right there is just that
kinship has been reaffirmed.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.300
But we can also see Cash
as an ironic instance

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.867
of a have as well.

00:28:42.867 --> 00:28:46.200
And this is something that would
actually come into play

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:52.133
in a big way in the last
Hemingway novel that--

00:28:52.133 --> 00:28:55.900
in fact, it comes into play
in two Hemingway novels.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:01.333
I promise you that this ironic
use of the have will be a

00:29:01.333 --> 00:29:06.233
central moment in For
Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:29:06.233 --> 00:29:08.667
So we have that to
look forward to.

00:29:08.667 --> 00:29:12.067
But we can also look back to an
earlier moment in To Have

00:29:12.067 --> 00:29:13.267
and Have Not.

00:29:13.267 --> 00:29:17.867
When Harry Morgan is dying,
he's unconscious.

00:29:17.867 --> 00:29:21.767
And he feels there's rubber
hose inside of him.

00:29:21.767 --> 00:29:26.600
So when we're talking about
that moment, I was

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.800
suggesting-- although I wasn't
pushing very hard on that--

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.267
that there was a moment of an
ironic have. We don't actually

00:29:33.267 --> 00:29:35.667
rubber hoses inside
our bellies.

00:29:35.667 --> 00:29:38.033
But it can sometimes
feel that way.

00:29:38.033 --> 00:29:42.200
And so it's an ironic
possession, a very negative

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.800
possession ironically
invested in us.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:51.667
And here, it's the same
idea in Faulkner.

00:29:51.667 --> 00:29:57.267
Cash as having an ironic
possession that turns him into

00:29:57.267 --> 00:30:00.867
a casualty as it did
Harry Morgan in To

00:30:00.867 --> 00:30:02.200
Have and Have Not.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.300
"Cash has a broken leg.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.867
He has had two broken legs.

00:30:07.867 --> 00:30:11.300
He lies on the box with a quilt
rolled under his head

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.067
and a piece of wood
under his knee.

00:30:14.067 --> 00:30:17.233
'I reckon we ought to left him
at Armstid's,' pa says.

00:30:17.233 --> 00:30:23.200
I haven't got a broken leg and
pa hasn't and Darl hasn't and

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.167
"It's just the bumps,' Cash
says. "It kind of grinds

00:30:26.167 --> 00:30:27.933
together a little on a bump.

00:30:27.933 --> 00:30:30.367
It don't bother none.'"

00:30:30.367 --> 00:30:34.100
So Vardaman is the one
who's speaking here.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:39.700
Vardaman is really rubbing it in
that Cash has a broken leg.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.200
He has had two in his life.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.700
He's managed to break both his
legs in his occupation as a

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.100
carpenter falling down
from some height.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:57.967
In this case, just his leg is
broken actually by the horse

00:30:57.967 --> 00:31:00.433
and the log.

00:31:00.433 --> 00:31:05.100
So that's what he has.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.267
He's lost his tools
at this point.

00:31:07.267 --> 00:31:10.267
He's lost his consciousness.

00:31:10.267 --> 00:31:11.633
He's lost his leg.

00:31:11.633 --> 00:31:14.800
But what he has instead of a
good leg is a broken leg.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.333
That is what is in his
possession now.

00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:22.133
So it's definitely an ironic
instance of a have. And

00:31:22.133 --> 00:31:24.233
Vardaman is very, very glad
he doesn't have that.

00:31:24.233 --> 00:31:25.400
I don't have that.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.600
Pa doesn't have that.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.100
Darl doesn't have that.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:33.233
So definitely it is the verb
to "have" is a liability.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.900
So that is an instance of
ironizing that verb.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.100
But there's also kind of a
straightforward instance of

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:49.433
Cash as a have not in a very
simple, quantifiable way.

00:31:49.433 --> 00:31:52.667
And actually, quantification
is kind of interesting in

00:31:52.667 --> 00:31:53.933
Faulkner as well.

00:31:53.933 --> 00:31:56.433
If we think of the entire novel,
the whole narrative

00:31:56.433 --> 00:31:58.700
economy is kind of
zero sum game.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:02.633
They're actually quantifying
who gets what and measuring

00:32:02.633 --> 00:32:04.300
that against who loses what.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.867
Actually, there's kind of
quantifying logic going on in

00:32:07.867 --> 00:32:09.300
As I Lay Dying.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:14.400
So this is a quantifying moment
in As I Lay Dying.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.967
We know that the mules have
drowned, so they have to get

00:32:17.967 --> 00:32:19.500
another team of mules.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.867
These are very, very
poor people.

00:32:21.867 --> 00:32:27.200
A team of mules would
cost $40.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.900
And it seems that Anse actually
has managed to come

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.767
up with the $40.

00:32:33.767 --> 00:32:39.967
So Darl is trying to figure out
where he got the $40 from.

00:32:39.967 --> 00:32:44.033
"'So that's what you were doing
in Cash's clothes last

00:32:44.033 --> 00:32:45.967
night, ' Darl said...

00:32:45.967 --> 00:32:49.167
'Cash aimed to buy that talking
machine from Surratt

00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:51.700
with that money, ' Darl said.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.367
Anse stood there mumbling
his mouth.

00:32:54.367 --> 00:32:55.367
Jewel watched him.

00:32:55.367 --> 00:32:57.867
He ain't never blinked yet.

00:32:57.867 --> 00:33:02.367
'But that's just $8 more,' Darl
said, in that voice like

00:33:02.367 --> 00:33:06.100
he was just listening and never
give a durn himself.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.500
'That still won't buy a team.'
Anse looked at Jewel, quick,

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.400
kind of sliding his eyes
that way, then

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.867
he looked down again.

00:33:14.867 --> 00:33:17.600
'God knows, if there were
ere a man, ' he says.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.733
Still they didn't say nothing.

00:33:18.733 --> 00:33:22.633
The just watched him, waiting,
and him sliding his eyes

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:26.733
toward their feet and up their
legs but no higher.

00:33:26.733 --> 00:33:30.267
'And the horse,' he says."

00:33:30.267 --> 00:33:38.800
So we know exactly what it takes
to reach that $40 mark.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.167
He has to get $10
from Dewey Dell.

00:33:42.167 --> 00:33:44.233
There's no time to
talk about that.

00:33:44.233 --> 00:33:44.833
It's just straightforward.

00:33:44.833 --> 00:33:49.233
She owes $10 from Rafe
for the abortion.

00:33:49.233 --> 00:33:52.267
And he got the $10 from her.

00:33:52.267 --> 00:33:57.700
And he gets $8 from Cash.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.300
Cash was going to use that
to buy a telephone.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:06.000
That's very far from
that goal of $40.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.400
So one very valuable thing has
to be traded in order for him

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.700
to get the $40.

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.133
And there's just
one thing left.

00:34:16.133 --> 00:34:19.533
It's the most obvious item
that is in anyone's

00:34:19.533 --> 00:34:21.367
possession.

00:34:21.367 --> 00:34:24.100
So we can turn now to--

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:29.400
Jewel's horse obviously is key
from beginning to end.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.233
But since we've been talking
about kinship between humans

00:34:33.233 --> 00:34:38.467
and animals, I just wanted to
stop very briefly and once

00:34:38.467 --> 00:34:40.900
again, hold down the conjecture
that I think that

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:45.633
what Faulkner here is, in some
ways, taking us back to the

00:34:45.633 --> 00:34:50.867
moment when Jewel is both
a horse and a snake.

00:34:50.867 --> 00:34:53.733
We talked about that
last time that he's

00:34:53.733 --> 00:34:55.367
caught between two poles.

00:34:55.367 --> 00:35:00.100
He's both a horse, but also
there's something snake-like

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.567
about his movement.

00:35:01.567 --> 00:35:07.067
And it seems that that
association with the snake has

00:35:07.067 --> 00:35:10.233
been reinvested in Anse.

00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:14.700
So we have the image of him
repeated twice as sliding his

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.000
eyes towards Jewel.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.467
Sliding his eyes toward their
feet and up their

00:35:19.467 --> 00:35:21.767
legs, but no higher.

00:35:21.767 --> 00:35:26.667
It is that sliding motion that
realized the human, non-human

00:35:26.667 --> 00:35:32.167
configuration in As I Lay Dying
so that it is Anse who

00:35:32.167 --> 00:35:35.100
is the snake in the family.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:40.767
And it's as if Jewel has
suddenly been freed from his

00:35:40.767 --> 00:35:43.100
kinship with the snake.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.800
Maybe this is also
a zero sum game.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:51.200
There's only one person in the
family who could claim kinship

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.933
with a snake, Anse.

00:35:52.933 --> 00:35:56.867
Anse right here is claiming
kinship with the snake.

00:35:56.867 --> 00:36:01.600
So Jewel is going to relinquish
his kinship and be

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.800
redefined in a different way.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.833
But just to wrap up with
Cash he's lost $8.

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.767
Once again, true to his name.

00:36:10.767 --> 00:36:12.000
That's what he loses.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
It's still a very petty sum.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.233
But this is the big loser.

00:36:18.233 --> 00:36:20.700
And he has that much in his
possession so he can

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.567
afford to lose big.

00:36:23.567 --> 00:36:28.500
But let's start out with an
image of Jewel as still a

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.433
have. Still having that thing.

00:36:34.667 --> 00:36:39.700
When the emerging situation is
becoming clear to everyone, it

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.467
is Jewel that Anse
is looking at.

00:36:41.467 --> 00:36:44.133
And Jewel has not reacted
in any fashion.

00:36:44.133 --> 00:36:51.167
So this is a true turning point
or a critical moment

00:36:51.167 --> 00:36:52.900
when things could have
gone either way.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.933
So the horse is still in
Jewel's possession.

00:36:56.933 --> 00:36:59.300
He doesn't have to give
up the horse.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.433
It would be impossible
for Anse to take

00:37:02.433 --> 00:37:03.633
control of the horse.

00:37:03.633 --> 00:37:05.267
He's the last person
to be able to

00:37:05.267 --> 00:37:06.533
control that wild horse.

00:37:06.533 --> 00:37:10.100
Only one person can control
that horse and it's Jewel.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.100
So this is a critical moment.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:16.033
How is Anse going to be able to
get a hold of the horse to

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:17.867
sell the horse?

00:37:17.867 --> 00:37:21.300
And it seems as if
Jewel is really

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.533
tended in one direction.

00:37:23.533 --> 00:37:26.900
This is a road that he
could have taken.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.267
But I'm giving it away in
the sense that no, it's

00:37:29.267 --> 00:37:30.233
the road not taken.

00:37:30.233 --> 00:37:32.100
But this is moment when it looks
like this is the road

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.400
that he's about to take.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.033
So as soon as Jewel hears
that the horse

00:37:37.033 --> 00:37:38.367
is part of the bargain.

00:37:38.367 --> 00:37:42.967
"Then he spit, slow, and said
'Hell' and he turned and went

00:37:42.967 --> 00:37:46.867
on to the gate and unhitched
the horse and got on it...

00:37:46.867 --> 00:37:49.700
They went out of sight that way,
the two of them looking

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.033
like some kind of spotted
cyclone."

00:37:52.033 --> 00:37:57.600
Still true to that original
image of incredibly fast

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.133
movement, almost superhuman in
the speed with which the two

00:38:01.133 --> 00:38:01.967
of them move.

00:38:01.967 --> 00:38:05.267
And also superhuman, almost
mythic in the sense that man

00:38:05.267 --> 00:38:06.633
and horse had become one.

00:38:06.633 --> 00:38:09.133
This is the Hemingway
image that is

00:38:09.133 --> 00:38:11.400
transposed onto Faulkner.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.367
This is the closest that
Faulkner will ever get to

00:38:14.367 --> 00:38:17.800
Hemingway is Jewel and the
horse becoming one.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:22.467
So it looks like that Anse is
never going to be able to get

00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:26.700
$40, because Jewel and the
horse have cleared out.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.033
Jewel can still be a have
if this were the

00:38:30.033 --> 00:38:33.667
ending of As I Lay Dying.

00:38:33.667 --> 00:38:36.600
But this is what happens
after that.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.333
"'The horse?' I said.

00:38:39.333 --> 00:38:43.933
Anse's boy taken that horse
and cleared out last night

00:38:43.933 --> 00:38:47.233
probably half way to Texas by
now, and Anse--' 'I don't know

00:38:47.233 --> 00:38:49.400
who brung it,' Eustace said.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.567
"I never see them.

00:38:50.567 --> 00:38:54.167
I just found the horse in the
barn this morning when I went

00:38:54.167 --> 00:38:58.633
to feed, and I told Mr. Snopes,
and he said to bring

00:38:58.633 --> 00:39:00.333
the team over here.'"

00:39:00.333 --> 00:39:05.167
So the team of mules
arrives because Mr.

00:39:05.167 --> 00:39:08.267
Snopes did get the horse.

00:39:08.267 --> 00:39:12.933
And only one person could have
brought the horse to Snopes.

00:39:12.933 --> 00:39:17.667
So Jewel becomes a have not.

00:39:17.667 --> 00:39:21.567
And we can see why he's losing
his kinship to the snake--

00:39:21.567 --> 00:39:26.800
becoming a have not by
voluntarily relinquishing his

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.000
possession of the horse.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.467
He is the most tragic figure in
one sense, because he has

00:39:33.467 --> 00:39:37.633
the most power to refuse to
relinquish that possession.

00:39:37.633 --> 00:39:41.033
And he is the one who actually,
out of his power,

00:39:41.033 --> 00:39:45.833
actually, willfully,
deliberately, consciously,

00:39:45.833 --> 00:39:48.567
gives up that possession.

00:39:48.567 --> 00:39:55.500
So the time has come for
remapping of the whole kinship

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.767
structure in As I Lay Dying.

00:39:58.767 --> 00:40:01.800
Jewel has, up to this
point, been the

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.967
outsider to the family.

00:40:03.967 --> 00:40:09.000
He's the one that everyone picks
out as being a non-kin

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.433
by Darl and by Dewey Dell.

00:40:11.433 --> 00:40:15.667
But this is the moment when
all of a sudden he's been

00:40:15.667 --> 00:40:21.433
admitted for the first time
into the family circle.

00:40:21.433 --> 00:40:26.200
And what's interesting is that
this redrawing of the kinship

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:33.067
lines is dramatized by Faulkner
as the racialization

00:40:33.067 --> 00:40:35.500
of both Cash and Jewel.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.933
And we can see why they
both racialize at

00:40:38.933 --> 00:40:40.167
this critical moment.

00:40:40.167 --> 00:40:44.000
They become kin, because
they both become black.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.100
"Cash's leg and foot
turned black.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.667
We held lamp and looked
at Cash's foot and leg

00:40:50.667 --> 00:40:52.167
where it was black.

00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:56.467
'Your foot looks like a nigger's
foot, Cash,' I said.

00:40:56.467 --> 00:41:01.967
Jewel was lying on his face
His back was red.

00:41:01.967 --> 00:41:03.867
Dewey Dell put the
medicine on it.

00:41:03.867 --> 00:41:06.367
The medicine was made out
of butter and soot, to

00:41:06.367 --> 00:41:07.933
draw out the fire.

00:41:07.933 --> 00:41:09.900
Then his back was black.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.367
'Does it hurt, Jewel?' I said.

00:41:11.367 --> 00:41:14.300
'Your back looks like a
nigger's, Jewel,' I said.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.800
Cash's foot and leg looked
like a nigger's."

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.167
This is really heavy handed
on the part of Faulkner.

00:41:20.167 --> 00:41:27.200
They both look like niggers, and
for two different reasons.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:33.500
Cash's foot is turning black
because they put concrete on

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:37.900
it to fix the leg.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.067
To fix the broken leg,
the Bundrens have

00:41:40.067 --> 00:41:42.633
put concrete on it.

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:46.733
That's the medical practice
within the Bundren family.

00:41:46.733 --> 00:41:51.033
So his foot is turning
black at this moment.

00:41:51.033 --> 00:41:58.033
And Jewel's back is black
because he has

00:41:58.033 --> 00:41:58.967
just been in the fire.

00:41:58.967 --> 00:42:01.700
He's the one who actually saved
the coffin, although

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.567
it's a dubious thing to do.

00:42:03.567 --> 00:42:06.767
He's the one who actually saves
the coffin when the barn

00:42:06.767 --> 00:42:08.567
was set on fire.

00:42:08.567 --> 00:42:12.767
And as a consequence, he gets
this severe burn on his back.

00:42:12.767 --> 00:42:15.700
And that's why his back
is all black.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:20.033
So each of them actually has
lost something, and they've

00:42:20.033 --> 00:42:20.833
gained something.

00:42:20.833 --> 00:42:24.267
They don't have a normal color,
like anyone has normal

00:42:24.267 --> 00:42:25.033
colored back.

00:42:25.033 --> 00:42:25.900
They've got them.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.600
They've gained a black
leg and a black back.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:34.467
And as a result of being
blackened in this manner, then

00:42:34.467 --> 00:42:36.400
all of a sudden, they
become brothers.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:44.067
So this is a new concept of
brotherhood and new membership

00:42:44.067 --> 00:42:48.133
being proposed for that
kinship structure.

00:42:48.133 --> 00:42:54.067
Jewel who has previously been
outside of that kinship circle

00:42:54.067 --> 00:42:55.667
has been admitted.

00:42:55.667 --> 00:43:00.733
And we'll see who is going to
be excluded once again.

00:43:00.733 --> 00:43:02.100
It's a zero sum game.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:07.633
If someone has been let in, who
is it and for what reason

00:43:07.633 --> 00:43:12.533
is he going to be left out?

00:43:12.533 --> 00:43:15.400
"It wasn't nothing else to do.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:21.200
It was either send him to
Jackson, or have Gillespie sue

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:26.667
us, because he knowed some
way that Darl set to it."

00:43:26.667 --> 00:43:31.500
So everything is interlocking
in Faulkner.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:37.467
It is that fire that
turns Jewel's back

00:43:37.467 --> 00:43:40.367
into a black back.

00:43:40.367 --> 00:43:44.267
And the same fire also has
consequences for other people.

00:43:44.267 --> 00:43:49.733
You don't set fire to a barn
without someone paying for it.

00:43:49.733 --> 00:43:52.867
And it turns out that
it is Darl who's

00:43:52.867 --> 00:43:54.000
going to pay for it.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.667
And the language that is used
here-- this is Cash who is

00:43:57.667 --> 00:44:03.867
speaking, still in the voice of
someone who's used to being

00:44:03.867 --> 00:44:09.433
helpless and used to not being
able to modify the situation

00:44:09.433 --> 00:44:10.333
that is given.

00:44:10.333 --> 00:44:12.333
There's just nothing
else to do.

00:44:12.333 --> 00:44:17.000
One person has to take the
blame and to take the

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.867
consequences of that blame.

00:44:18.867 --> 00:44:22.033
So one person has to
be sent to Jackson.

00:44:22.033 --> 00:44:24.533
And know what Jackson is.

00:44:24.533 --> 00:44:28.900
It already has been a looming
presence in The Sound and the

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.067
Fury as the ultimate
home for Benjy.

00:44:33.067 --> 00:44:39.100
And it is actually the home for
Darl much sooner than it

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.267
will be for Benjy.

00:44:41.267 --> 00:44:46.633
So let's look at two instances
of the reconstituting of the

00:44:46.633 --> 00:44:49.900
narrowing of the
kinship circle.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:55.933
And Cash talking now and looking
at his brother, Darl,

00:44:55.933 --> 00:45:02.433
but beginning to see his
brother as a non-kin.

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:05.367
This is Cash speaking.

00:45:05.367 --> 00:45:08.833
Actually, he sort of agrees with
Darl that maybe it's a

00:45:08.833 --> 00:45:10.567
good thing to burn
up the coffin.

00:45:10.567 --> 00:45:14.100
It's just so humiliating for
Addie to be smelling and to

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.267
have all the buzzards
descending on her.

00:45:16.267 --> 00:45:19.500
They keep counting 10 and
then more and more.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.533
And everyone --

00:45:20.533 --> 00:45:23.300
all the towns they
go through --

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.033
wanting to sue them because of
the terrible smell that is

00:45:26.033 --> 00:45:28.433
coming from the coffin.

00:45:28.433 --> 00:45:30.900
So because of this other
humiliation that's been

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.800
visited upon Addie, it would
have been a good thing to burn

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.133
up the coffin.

00:45:35.133 --> 00:45:37.167
And because it wasn't going to
happen and nobody else was

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:38.733
going to do, Darl was
going to do it.

00:45:38.733 --> 00:45:42.767
So Cash can see the reason for
wanting to burn up the coffin.

00:45:42.767 --> 00:45:45.633
But he can also see that it
maybe is not such a great

00:45:45.633 --> 00:45:47.333
thing for the person
who is doing it.

00:45:47.333 --> 00:45:50.567
"... when Darl seen that looked
like one of us would

00:45:50.567 --> 00:45:53.433
have to do something, I
can almost believe he

00:45:53.433 --> 00:45:56.033
done right in a way.

00:45:56.033 --> 00:45:59.867
But I don't reckon nothing
excuses setting fire to a

00:45:59.867 --> 00:46:03.400
man's barn and endangering
his stock and

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.233
destroying his property.

00:46:06.233 --> 00:46:08.000
That's how I reckon
a man is crazy.

00:46:10.867 --> 00:46:14.367
That's how he can't see eye
to eye with other folks.

00:46:14.367 --> 00:46:17.367
And I reckon they ain't nothing
else to do with him

00:46:17.367 --> 00:46:21.533
but what the most folks
says is right."

00:46:21.533 --> 00:46:31.367
So Cash ceding his bond with
Darl as Darl's brother.

00:46:31.367 --> 00:46:37.433
The kinship bond is superseded
by a much more clear kind of

00:46:37.433 --> 00:46:40.667
property relation.

00:46:40.667 --> 00:46:44.033
Darl really has no relation to
Gillespie other than that he

00:46:44.033 --> 00:46:47.533
is the destroyer of Gillespie's
property.

00:46:47.533 --> 00:46:51.967
But it is as a destroyer of
Gillespie's property that he

00:46:51.967 --> 00:46:53.833
will get sent to Jackson.

00:46:53.833 --> 00:46:59.367
It is that impersonal property
relationship that will define

00:46:59.367 --> 00:47:06.367
Darl in the end and not his
kinship with his two brothers.

00:47:06.367 --> 00:47:11.200
So this is the beginning of the
exclusion and the logic

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:16.700
for that exclusion of Darl
from that family circle.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.867
But it is Vardaman who
puts the case most

00:47:19.867 --> 00:47:23.400
strongly and clearly.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.700
Vardaman talking about Darl.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.533
"He went to Jackson.

00:47:26.533 --> 00:47:29.967
He went crazy and went
to Jackson both.

00:47:29.967 --> 00:47:31.967
Lots of people who
didn't go crazy.

00:47:31.967 --> 00:47:34.133
Pa and Cash and Jewel
and Dewey Dell and

00:47:34.133 --> 00:47:36.233
me didn't go crazy.

00:47:36.233 --> 00:47:38.000
We never did go crazy.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.800
We didn't go to Jackson
either, Darl."

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.700
This is a child.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:48.367
He's the cruelest, but he's also
the most honest that the

00:47:48.367 --> 00:47:52.533
family from now on is going to
be Pa and Cash and Jewel and

00:47:52.533 --> 00:47:55.300
Dewey Dell and me, Vardaman.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:59.333
He's not going to include
Darl anymore.

00:47:59.333 --> 00:48:03.100
It's been radically
reconstituted.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.833
And it is on the basis of that
reconstitution that we can

00:48:07.833 --> 00:48:11.233
think about Darl as a "have
not," as the ultimate "have

00:48:11.233 --> 00:48:11.733
not."

00:48:11.733 --> 00:48:15.467
I think Darl and Jewel as
symmetrical in that sense.

00:48:15.467 --> 00:48:20.933
Jewel has given the thing that
is most monetarily valuable.

00:48:20.933 --> 00:48:23.167
And Darl has given up
the thing that is

00:48:23.167 --> 00:48:24.633
most humanly valuable.

00:48:27.533 --> 00:48:31.000
This is Darl speaking, referring
to himself in the

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.967
third person, talking about
himself in the third person.

00:48:35.967 --> 00:48:36.967
"Darl has gone to Jackson.

00:48:36.967 --> 00:48:41.233
They put him on the train,
laughing, down the long car

00:48:41.233 --> 00:48:43.567
laughing, the heads turning
like the heads of

00:48:43.567 --> 00:48:45.133
owls when be passed.

00:48:45.133 --> 00:48:47.433
'What are you laughing
at? ' I said.

00:48:47.433 --> 00:48:49.467
'Yes, yes, yes, yes,'...

00:48:49.467 --> 00:48:52.333
Darl is our brother,
our brother Darl.

00:48:52.333 --> 00:48:56.067
Our brother Darl in a cage in
Jackson where, his grimed

00:48:56.067 --> 00:48:59.833
hands lying light in the
interstices, looking out he

00:48:59.833 --> 00:49:05.300
foams. 'Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.'"

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.267
So he's lost his mind.

00:49:07.267 --> 00:49:14.200
That is what there is to lose
in the course of this novel.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.633
He has lost his family.

00:49:15.633 --> 00:49:20.733
We know that that's one of the
non-monetary things that can

00:49:20.733 --> 00:49:23.467
also be lost. He's lost
his brothers.

00:49:23.467 --> 00:49:24.900
He's lost everything.

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.467
He's lost his freedom.

00:49:27.467 --> 00:49:29.667
And he also has lost his mind.

00:49:29.667 --> 00:49:34.400
So we can't really think of
a darker ending than this.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:39.533
And it says a lot about Faulkner
that this darkest of

00:49:39.533 --> 00:49:44.233
endings is actually stuck in
the middle of a story that

00:49:44.233 --> 00:49:45.500
actually has a comic ending.

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:47.800
And that's what Faulkner
does with genres.

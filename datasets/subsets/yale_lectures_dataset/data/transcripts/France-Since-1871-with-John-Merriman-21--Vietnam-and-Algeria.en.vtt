00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.273
Professor John Merriman:
Okay, by the way there was

00:00:05.273 --> 00:00:08.119
big trouble over the weekend in
a suburb.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.147
Next week, the last day,
I'm going to talk about the

00:00:11.147 --> 00:00:13.760
problem, so-called problem of
the suburbs.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.666
There was a big problem the
other night and when a policeman

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.845
ran down two kids on a scooter,
a scooter,

00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:23.560
and they were both killed
apparently.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.980
And, so, there's a lot of riots
again going on.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.191
So, you can--again you can
follow this, if you know French,

00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:34.040
on France 2 or TFN,
or in Libération;

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.520
but this will probably be in
the newspapers.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.683
Anyway, so what I want to talk
about today--it's hard to do

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:46.528
both of them in one day,
but let's go--is to complement

00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:52.287
your reading on de-colonization,
and talk about Vietnam and

00:00:52.287 --> 00:00:54.455
Algeria,
and the subtext,

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:58.152
obviously--it's not text that's
intended in this course,

00:00:58.152 --> 00:01:02.319
but is that the Americans never
learned the mistakes from which

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:07.024
the French finally learned.
Next week, or next Wednesday,

00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:11.955
I'll talk about Charles de
Gaulle, but mostly about after

00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:16.989
he comes to power in 1958.
But he's obviously important in

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:19.969
this.
You know from the beginning

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:25.617
that it's after World War Two
that most of the colonies in the

00:01:25.617 --> 00:01:30.763
world became independent,
in a process that took decades,

00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:35.129
and of course the 1960s,
particularly the beginning of

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:39.910
the 1960s,
is very, very crucial in the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.221
case of Africa.
And this, despite the

00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:50.168
insistence of Winston Churchill,
for one, that the British

00:01:50.168 --> 00:01:57.481
Empire would not be dismembered.
In Britain this transition from

00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:04.332
colony to independent state
stays often replete and full of

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:08.572
problems,
came without violence,

00:02:08.572 --> 00:02:13.319
came generally without
insurrection.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.228
This was not the case with
France nor, as you know,

00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:22.056
some of you,
not the case in Portuguese,

00:02:22.056 --> 00:02:25.590
for Portuguese colonies as
well.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.129
The Netherlands and Britain
both resisted independence

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.158
movements before caving in.
And by 1980,

00:02:35.158 --> 00:02:39.400
a year that I can even
remember--that was a pleasure

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.141
because I was married that
year--more than half of the 154

00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:49.132
members of the United Nations
had been admitted to membership

00:02:49.132 --> 00:02:53.926
since 1956.
Now, one obvious point is that

00:02:53.926 --> 00:03:00.191
part of the dismantling of
empires, one important theme in

00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:06.784
this is that Britain and France
in the post-war period became

00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:12.060
less important powers than they
had before;

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.235
is that, as you know,
France--and this was essential

00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:21.230
in de Gaulle's view of himself
and view of the world--seeks to

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.259
retain its role as a great
power,

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.591
but the world had basically
been divided up in the Cold War

00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:32.250
between the Soviet Union and the
United States,

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.596
and both of those powers were
competing aggressively for these

00:03:37.596 --> 00:03:40.840
newly independent states in
Africa,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.789
in Asia and indeed in North
Africa as well.

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:50.965
And, so, World War Two
accentuated the independence

00:03:50.965 --> 00:03:54.889
movements that developed after
World War One.

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.805
The case of Vietnam is of
course just classic in that,

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:05.184
and you had a well-organized
nationalist communist movement

00:04:05.184 --> 00:04:10.377
ready to assume the mantle of
the movement for Vietnamese

00:04:10.377 --> 00:04:13.835
independence.
And as you'll know,

00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:17.941
Woodrow Wilson espoused
nationalism as a way to

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:22.850
determining the existence or the
creation of states.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.814
And, so, Wilson and his
American successors were kind of

00:04:26.814 --> 00:04:31.139
caught in a trap because on the
one hand they were saying,

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.400
"oh yes, we need to recognize
independence movements and

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.075
people that see themselves as a
single nation ought to have the

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:42.876
right to have their own state,"
but then because of the domain

00:04:42.876 --> 00:04:48.419
of the Cold War the Americans
often found themselves acting in

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.690
ways that they did not match
their rhetoric.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.734
The French left Syria and
Lebanon by agreement made with

00:04:58.734 --> 00:05:03.790
the United States and Britain
after the war,

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.658
but the problem of Vietnam and
the problem of North Africa,

00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:11.060
as you know where the French
had been since 1830,

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.675
would be much thornier.
Now, Ho Chi Minh--I can

00:05:15.675 --> 00:05:18.583
remember this;
and so it's sort of time warp

00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:21.839
for someone like me because I
can remember all the marches,

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.258
and was in all the marches
against the war,

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:29.817
back when I was your age,
and the chants of "Ho-Ho-Ho Chi

00:05:29.817 --> 00:05:32.879
Minh,
NLF is gonna win."

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:37.230
He'd become president of the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.513
after the war.
Ho Chi Minh's father was an

00:05:40.513 --> 00:05:43.909
official under the French,
under French rule,

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.539
and he had resigned from his
position because he had become a

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.015
Vietnamese nationalist.
And there were other

00:05:52.015 --> 00:05:55.160
nationalists by the way.
One has a tendency to say,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.874
well, the Communist Party
represented Vietnamese

00:05:57.874 --> 00:06:00.141
nationalism,
but there were other

00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:04.064
nationalists who weren't
communists, but the war--because

00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:08.267
the war ends--the way the war
comes out one ends up talking a

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:12.325
lot about communist nationalism.
But he had been working,

00:06:12.325 --> 00:06:15.074
a kitchen helper,
on a French passenger liner,

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:17.944
crossing the oceans,
before becoming a communist

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:20.838
activist.
And he founded in 1929 the

00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:25.307
Indochinese Communist Party,
which he founded in Hong Kong

00:06:25.307 --> 00:06:28.124
in 1929.
In 1930 he unified three groups

00:06:28.124 --> 00:06:31.149
of Vietnamese Communists around
his leadership.

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:34.401
He was condemned to death in
absentia by the French

00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:38.043
government and he was saved by
the refusal of the British

00:06:38.043 --> 00:06:41.879
government in Hong Kong to turn
him over to the French,

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.589
because he would've been
executed, without any question.

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:50.217
But he was arrested by the
British in 1931 and he remained

00:06:50.217 --> 00:06:53.139
in prison in Hong Kong until
1933.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:57.241
And during World War Two he led
the Vietminh--viet,

00:06:57.241 --> 00:07:01.015
and then m-i-n-h--an
organization of Vietnamese

00:07:01.015 --> 00:07:03.266
nationalists,
some of whom,

00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:06.889
but as I said before not all of
whom, were communists.

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:10.908
Now, the French attacked the
port of Haiphong--God,

00:07:10.908 --> 00:07:15.587
these are names out of my past;
I did not know about Haiphong,

00:07:15.587 --> 00:07:18.899
I was a couple of years old
then, not even that,

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:22.446
I guess-- killing 6,000
Vietnamese, and they captured

00:07:22.446 --> 00:07:25.924
Hanoi, the Vietnamese
capital--and this is after the

00:07:25.924 --> 00:07:28.962
war.
And, so, France restored the

00:07:28.962 --> 00:07:33.947
nominal authority of a playboy
emperor, but Ho Chi Minh's

00:07:33.947 --> 00:07:38.220
Vietnamese Army held most of the
countryside,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.224
rather like Mao Tse-tung's army
in China, had begun during the

00:07:43.224 --> 00:07:48.065
war against Kuomintang to carve
out huge sections of Chinese

00:07:48.065 --> 00:07:51.945
territory as well.
And Ho was supported by the

00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:54.866
Chinese communists,
and he prophesized,

00:07:54.866 --> 00:07:59.709
"you will kill ten of our men
but we will kill one of yours,

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:03.500
and in the end we will end up
by wearing you out."

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.254
Now, these were the origins of,
at least in the modern era,

00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:11.727
of guerrilla warfare.
A French intellectual who's

00:08:11.727 --> 00:08:15.490
still living called Regis Debray
wrote a very important book that

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.430
I remember I had to read in the
seminar on revolutionary elites,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.064
with Arthur Mendel at the
University of Michigan,

00:08:22.064 --> 00:08:24.589
called Revolution dans la
Revolution,

00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:27.939
Revolution in the Revolution,
about guerrilla fighting.

00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:32.200
Now, if you go back,
those that go back to before

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.880
1871--'70/'71--remember what the
Spanish patriots were able to do

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.230
in Spain against Napoleon's
occupying forces,

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.010
which was to pick them off one
by one, and the French

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.149
retaliated by shooting down
civilians,

00:08:47.149 --> 00:08:50.639
as they did in Calabria in the
south of Italy and other places.

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:55.777
But, "you will kill ten of ours
and we will kill one of yours,"

00:08:55.777 --> 00:09:00.832
and eventually what happens in
the Vietnam case is that--as in

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:05.886
Algerian the case--is that the
pressure to pull out of the war

00:09:05.886 --> 00:09:10.029
becomes so enormous that that
strategy wins,

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:13.130
and that the costs of
continuing to fight,

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.988
to battle, to repress,
depending on your view of the

00:09:16.988 --> 00:09:21.225
matter,
will affect the home front,

00:09:21.225 --> 00:09:28.413
and the home front will demand
the end of the fighting and

00:09:28.413 --> 00:09:33.944
indeed of the empire.
Early in 1954 the French Army

00:09:33.944 --> 00:09:38.954
suffered a major defeat at the
hands of the Vietnamese at a

00:09:38.954 --> 00:09:43.532
place called Dien Bien
Phu--p-h-u at end--which is now

00:09:43.532 --> 00:09:46.660
a tourist site,
lots of French go there.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.037
I've never been there.
Just as Vietnam has become the

00:09:51.037 --> 00:09:56.110
major sort of tourist center,
and for--oddly,

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.062
not oddly enough,
but I suppose it's good in

00:09:58.062 --> 00:10:00.650
bringing these things to an
end--for lots of Americans who

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.807
fought over there,
and some of whom lost limbs

00:10:03.807 --> 00:10:08.520
over there, to go back and to
put at least closure on all of

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.464
that.
Pierre Mendès-France,

00:10:11.464 --> 00:10:15.826
who was the new socialist
premier, succeeded in taking

00:10:15.826 --> 00:10:18.789
France out of the war in
Vietnam;

00:10:18.789 --> 00:10:21.480
and as you know he would be
less successful in trying to

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.169
convince the French to drink
milk as opposed to wine,

00:10:24.169 --> 00:10:30.765
a hopeless task,
and he without question became

00:10:30.765 --> 00:10:38.508
the most eminent French
politician not to hold power as

00:10:38.508 --> 00:10:43.509
president in France.
The Geneva Convention that

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:46.809
year, France agreed to divide
Vietnam into two states.

00:10:46.809 --> 00:10:50.025
North Vietnam became a
communist regime,

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:53.570
led by Ho Chi Minh,
the capital of Hanoi;

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.852
and South Vietnam became a
republic run by a succession,

00:10:56.852 --> 00:11:00.076
I think it's fair to say,
of pretty corrupt leaders who

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:07.139
carried out U.S.
policy in exchange for a free

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:14.535
hand in all of that.
Now, one thing that was going

00:11:14.535 --> 00:11:21.043
on behind all of that is the
dissatisfaction of the army with

00:11:21.043 --> 00:11:26.148
what happened in Vietnam.
Now, because the army,

00:11:26.148 --> 00:11:30.944
which had emerged from World
War One victorious--but

00:11:30.944 --> 00:11:36.209
ultimately France was less
powerful than Germany had been

00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:40.161
in defeat;
France in victory was less

00:11:40.161 --> 00:11:46.319
powerful--had been defeated and
many officers argued that it was

00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:52.379
the collapse of the home front
that had brought this about,

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:56.056
and that they had been
supported actively by--over the

00:11:56.056 --> 00:11:58.812
long run;
if enough resources had been

00:11:58.812 --> 00:12:01.799
thrown in then victory could be
achieved.

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:06.338
Now, if that doesn't sound like
Vietnam in the late 1960s and

00:12:06.338 --> 00:12:10.876
early 1970s, a time that nobody
in this room except two of us

00:12:10.876 --> 00:12:14.672
remember,
because that's exactly the same

00:12:14.672 --> 00:12:17.477
scenario;
and it's exactly the same

00:12:17.477 --> 00:12:20.590
scenario now,
but that's another matter.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:25.402
And, so, therefore France gets
out of Vietnam,

00:12:25.402 --> 00:12:30.750
and one of the things that
happened--by the way,

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.707
my friend Mark Lawrence has an
excellent book on this--is that

00:12:35.707 --> 00:12:40.257
already the French and the
British in the late 1940s were

00:12:40.257 --> 00:12:44.889
getting the Americans to kind of
do what they wanted.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:49.059
But what happens then is that
when the French are gone,

00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:53.770
then the communist insurgency
in the north and the Vietcong in

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:58.481
the south lead to this bloody
series of just horrible years in

00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:02.960
which so many Americans and so
many Vietnamese died,

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:10.374
and they are commemorated by
Maya Lin's wall in Washington,

00:13:10.374 --> 00:13:16.811
with their names on it.
And you can remember those

00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:24.417
scenes of the frantic end when
the helicopters are pulling off

00:13:24.417 --> 00:13:31.149
the well-heeled and the
well-connected from Saigon,

00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:36.081
in the very end,
and it was a lesson that was

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:40.373
not learned;
and sometimes that's the way

00:13:40.373 --> 00:13:45.704
that things go.
But that was nothing compared

00:13:45.704 --> 00:13:50.519
to Algeria, that was nothing at
all.

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:55.276
And one of the big differences
why what happened in North

00:13:55.276 --> 00:13:58.250
Africa, but above all in
Algeria,

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:02.036
occurred is that Vietnam,
for all of the residuals of

00:14:02.036 --> 00:14:05.603
French architecture,
building cathedrals and opera

00:14:05.603 --> 00:14:09.171
houses along French
architectural lines--there's a

00:14:09.171 --> 00:14:13.758
wonderful book by a woman called
Gwendolyn Wright about imperial

00:14:13.758 --> 00:14:18.199
architecture--and there were a
good number of French living in

00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:21.432
Vietnam.
But Vietnam was not a

00:14:21.432 --> 00:14:25.368
settlement colony the way that,
for example,

00:14:25.368 --> 00:14:30.860
Australia and New Zealand had
been in the British Empire.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.792
But Algeria was,
and so was Morocco,

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:41.429
and Tunisia,
were settlement colonies.

00:14:41.429 --> 00:14:44.531
All sorts of people lived
there, from France,

00:14:44.531 --> 00:14:47.139
and they were called
colons,

00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:50.795
or settlers,
basically, and their nicknames

00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:54.799
were the pieds-noirs,
the black feet.

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:58.384
And there's several
interpretations-- maybe Brian

00:14:58.384 --> 00:15:02.791
can illuminate us--but sometimes
they were called black feet

00:15:02.791 --> 00:15:06.750
because of the boots that the
army soldiers wore,

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:11.114
or because it was thought that
if they walked over the burning

00:15:11.114 --> 00:15:14.978
sands of the Sahara that their
feet would be burned and

00:15:14.978 --> 00:15:18.866
therefore become noir.
But they were settlers,

00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:22.186
they were people who had been
there, in many cases,

00:15:22.186 --> 00:15:24.509
for generations and
generations.

00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:27.489
Now Algeria,
as Charles told you and you

00:15:27.489 --> 00:15:30.850
already know,
was first conquered in 1830;

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:36.029
Algiers falls in June,
the end of June or early July,

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:41.210
I can't remember which,
1830, and it's "pacified";

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:45.344
that is, lots of people are
slaughtered over the next

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:48.191
decades.
In 1851, after the insurgency

00:15:48.191 --> 00:15:52.434
to defend the democratic and
social republic against--this is

00:15:52.434 --> 00:15:56.324
before this course but it's
still important--against the

00:15:56.324 --> 00:16:00.285
coup d'état of Louis
Napoleon Bonaparte who became

00:16:00.285 --> 00:16:03.153
Napoleon III,
many of the people who were

00:16:03.153 --> 00:16:06.007
arrested and put on trial,
court-martialed essentially

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:08.429
before what they called mixed
commissions,

00:16:08.429 --> 00:16:14.370
were sent to Algeria,
either as prisoners in Algeria,

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:20.371
or just simply kicked out,
and then in a whole variety of

00:16:20.371 --> 00:16:26.254
ways were essentially allowed to
take lands that belonged to the

00:16:26.254 --> 00:16:32.669
Arab and Berber populations,
and therefore they are there.

00:16:32.669 --> 00:16:36.918
And one of the things about
imperialism is that this sort of

00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:40.311
social imperialism,
that Algeria was sort of a

00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:43.351
safety valve,
that people who couldn't find

00:16:43.351 --> 00:16:46.970
work or couldn't survive often
went to Algeria,

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.725
because it was sort of like the
far west, the image of the far

00:16:49.725 --> 00:16:52.120
west in the U.S.--there's a
place you can get land,

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:59.235
you can plant vineyards,
you can plant fruit and you'll

00:16:59.235 --> 00:17:02.745
have a life;
you could buy a café

00:17:02.745 --> 00:17:05.737
and you will have a life.
And, so, it was much easier to

00:17:05.737 --> 00:17:08.374
get out of Vietnam because you
didn't have a lot of French

00:17:08.374 --> 00:17:11.937
people living in Vietnam,
and many of the people in

00:17:11.937 --> 00:17:16.019
Algeria did not want the French
to pull out.

00:17:16.019 --> 00:17:18.940
They associated the empire with
their lives.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.079
They were French,
and Algeria as you know from

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.171
reading Chip's book,
Sauwerwein's book--who's

00:17:23.171 --> 00:17:25.006
retiring,
he's just retiring,

00:17:25.006 --> 00:17:28.653
there's a party for him I think
today at the University of

00:17:28.653 --> 00:17:32.493
Melbourne--that they were--I
lost my sentence there--but they

00:17:32.493 --> 00:17:35.630
were there and their empire was
their lives,

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.640
the French Empire was their
lives.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:47.118
And, so, you've got one million
French, originally French people

00:17:47.118 --> 00:17:52.300
living in Algeria;
you have 200,000 in Tunisia;

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:58.413
and you have 300,000 in Morocco.
And, so, they poured money into

00:17:58.413 --> 00:18:02.529
their cafés in
Algiers,

00:18:02.529 --> 00:18:06.320
in Algiers,
into their farms,

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:13.150
into their economic activities,
and they were there.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.960
Some of them were very wealthy,
big landowners;

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.093
they were called the gros
patrons, the big guys sort

00:18:20.093 --> 00:18:23.869
of, and they were determined
that France would stay in

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:29.520
Algeria, Algeria was French.
They were opposed by the FLN,

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:35.913
the Front de Libération
Nationale, which was very

00:18:35.913 --> 00:18:40.329
similar to the Vietminh in
Vietnam.

00:18:40.329 --> 00:18:46.025
And the resistance was also
very, as one would reasonably

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:50.500
expect, with Islam,
with the Muslim world.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:55.337
Three events in 1956 hardened
the lines between the

00:18:55.337 --> 00:18:58.723
colons,
that is the settlers,

00:18:58.723 --> 00:19:02.980
and Algerians fighting for
independence.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.431
On February 6th a mob in
Algiers greeted the French

00:19:06.431 --> 00:19:10.019
premier, who was called Mollet,
m-o-l-l-e-t,

00:19:10.019 --> 00:19:16.133
and his choice for governor
general who was considered by

00:19:16.133 --> 00:19:20.500
the colons to be too
pro-Arab,

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.089
and they greeted him with
rotten eggs and with tomatoes.

00:19:25.089 --> 00:19:30.237
And it's a very nasty scene and
Mollet capitulates and appoints

00:19:30.237 --> 00:19:34.311
a socialist,
a more strident on the issue of

00:19:34.311 --> 00:19:38.349
holding onto Algeria,
as governor general.

00:19:38.349 --> 00:19:45.083
In October 1956 there's a
conference between the Sultan of

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:50.400
Morocco and a leader of the FLN
in Tunisia.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.380
There is outrage in the French
rightwing press.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.650
And, so, French authorities had
the most important delegate at

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:02.589
this meeting,
a guy called Ben Bella who is

00:20:02.589 --> 00:20:04.970
still alive--b-e-n,
b-e-l-l-a.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.627
I just looked the other day to
see, and I think he's still

00:20:07.627 --> 00:20:09.590
alive;
he was born in something like

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:14.460
1919, if I remember correctly.
They have him kidnapped and put

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:19.885
in a jail near Paris.
They begin to repress critics

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:26.346
of this rather bold and totally
illegal act, and seize books

00:20:26.346 --> 00:20:32.109
that are against this movement.
And then in November,

00:20:32.109 --> 00:20:36.090
as some of you know,
the French government

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.460
participates in the whole Suez
Canal mess,

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:46.485
in part because Egypt--and
we'll see this in a minute,

00:20:46.485 --> 00:20:52.398
at least briefly--was an
important part of generating

00:20:52.398 --> 00:20:59.220
sympathy for the Algerian
national resistance movements.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:04.073
And the British and the French
invade, there's a ceasefire

00:21:04.073 --> 00:21:07.564
that's forced by Russia,
the Soviet Union,

00:21:07.564 --> 00:21:10.799
with the aid of the United
States.

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:15.626
And this seems to be another
humiliation, and what this does

00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:18.490
as it begins to harden the
lines.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.682
Now, the problem with all of
this again is the army,

00:21:22.682 --> 00:21:27.614
is that now it looks again from
the point of view of the high

00:21:27.614 --> 00:21:32.217
command in the army that again
the civilians are going to

00:21:32.217 --> 00:21:36.984
capitulate and there'll be some
humiliating withdrawal from

00:21:36.984 --> 00:21:40.220
Algeria,
as there had been from Vietnam.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.262
But it's a very different cost,
isn't it, because you've got a

00:21:43.262 --> 00:21:45.789
million "Frenchmen,"
in quotes, as they see

00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:49.690
themselves--they didn't accept
the Frenchness of the Other,

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.579
as they unfortunately saw the
Arab population.

00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:55.890
Is the army going to be
disgraced again?

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.629
Now, again World War Two and
the defeat in 1940,

00:21:59.629 --> 00:22:04.800
and people could remember that,
has to be seen as a background;

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.756
and the defeat in Vietnam.
In 1958 the average military

00:22:09.756 --> 00:22:14.637
officer had spent at least one
thirty-month tour of duty in

00:22:14.637 --> 00:22:19.265
Indochina and the average
military officer had spent two

00:22:19.265 --> 00:22:24.731
to four years in Algeria,
along with a small tour of the

00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:28.359
occupying garrisons in West
Germany.

00:22:28.359 --> 00:22:31.460
But support was wavering for
the war.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.578
Citations for wounded soldiers
stopped appearing in the

00:22:35.578 --> 00:22:39.240
official journal,
the Journal Officiel.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:46.170
20,000 French soldiers had died
in Vietnam--that's a lot;

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:53.420
9,000 had died by 1958 in
Algeria.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.327
And, so, there are charges of
abandonment and hatred of the

00:22:57.327 --> 00:23:00.089
officers of the French Communist
Party,

00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:01.283
which seemed to be
orchestrating,

00:23:01.283 --> 00:23:02.589
among other people
orchestrating it,

00:23:02.589 --> 00:23:05.990
along with the intellectuals,
opposition to the war.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:13.170
And then there was the issue of
torture--how topical again in

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:19.180
the world in which we lived.
The army had revived an old

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:24.200
concept of what they considered
to be the real country,

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.744
the true country,
the true France,

00:23:26.744 --> 00:23:30.060
if you will,
representing the real interests

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.364
of France,
that is the army,

00:23:33.364 --> 00:23:39.907
and the legal country,
which included some of those

00:23:39.907 --> 00:23:46.415
people who opposed them.
And, so, within the army there

00:23:46.415 --> 00:23:51.671
begins to be not only discord
but attempts to organize

00:23:51.671 --> 00:23:56.630
rightwing groups--they became
known as the OAS,

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.951
the secret army,
that eventually tries to kill

00:23:59.951 --> 00:24:03.789
Charles de Gaulle himself,
and launches a campaign of

00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:08.019
terror in France,
and things that you can read

00:24:08.019 --> 00:24:13.190
about.
They try a putsch in 1961.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.068
Sometimes--I used to show this
film in here,

00:24:16.068 --> 00:24:19.950
but the torture scene is too
hard to see and people used to

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.920
leave;
it's horrible but it's one of

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.680
the great movies made in our
lifetimes, it's The Battle of

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.536
Algiers;
The Battle of Algiers,

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:33.718
absolutely fantastic.
The scene where the woman with

00:24:33.718 --> 00:24:37.490
a bomb goes into a café
and places the bomb and looks

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:40.951
at families,
who personally she has nothing

00:24:40.951 --> 00:24:45.787
against, and she knows that
they're going to blow up and be

00:24:45.787 --> 00:24:49.789
killed--it's one of the great
scenes in film.

00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:53.108
And you think it's a
documentary but it's not,

00:24:53.108 --> 00:24:56.869
and it's about the French war
against the Kasbah,

00:24:56.869 --> 00:24:59.763
against the Algerian quarters,
and these two worlds,

00:24:59.763 --> 00:25:02.998
the French colon worlds
and the cafés of the

00:25:02.998 --> 00:25:06.799
colons--their extension
would be the port of Marseilles,

00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:12.456
the old port of Marseilles--and
the world of people in the

00:25:12.456 --> 00:25:15.590
Kasbah.
And, so, what the military

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:20.330
wants to do is they want to
break the political military

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:25.858
organization of the insurgents,
and they want to do this

00:25:25.858 --> 00:25:29.726
through state terror.
So, you have the terror of

00:25:29.726 --> 00:25:33.155
those who are accused of being
terrorists, who are blowing up

00:25:33.155 --> 00:25:36.573
cafés,
as the independence movement

00:25:36.573 --> 00:25:40.595
did in Vietnam,
and the state terror involving

00:25:40.595 --> 00:25:45.113
the systematic torture,
the murder, the slaughter of

00:25:45.113 --> 00:25:49.108
very ordinary people,
many of whom had nothing to do

00:25:49.108 --> 00:25:53.065
with anything.
And their response is

00:25:53.065 --> 00:25:57.260
repression, first;
second--this is from a book by

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.869
Chalmer, I think,
I can't remember who lists

00:25:59.869 --> 00:26:03.213
these things,
on the army--a totalitarian

00:26:03.213 --> 00:26:07.607
technique of organization
promising some reform but

00:26:07.607 --> 00:26:12.529
basically just organizing
basically a military state;

00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:16.666
the political activism of the
army, thus the OAS,

00:26:16.666 --> 00:26:21.407
and working on the French
population as a whole to argue

00:26:21.407 --> 00:26:26.492
that those who are against these
measures being taken by the

00:26:26.492 --> 00:26:31.059
French Army in the name of
France are disloyal,

00:26:31.059 --> 00:26:36.534
and do not represent the true
France, the real France,

00:26:36.534 --> 00:26:43.978
as they see it.
And, so, the cycle of violence

00:26:43.978 --> 00:26:51.328
is totally untenable.
And the intellectuals get

00:26:51.328 --> 00:26:55.142
involved-- Camus,
Albert Camus,

00:26:55.142 --> 00:27:02.390
and lots of others organize
opposition to the torture,

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:07.125
to this repression,
to these mass murders,

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:11.630
and the stakes increase
dramatically,

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:21.832
and it is a total chaos.
Camus, who was born in Algeria,

00:27:21.832 --> 00:27:27.181
described the difficult choices
for French families who lived in

00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:32.446
Algeria--the vast majority were
not in favor of mass murder and

00:27:32.446 --> 00:27:35.749
torture.
He said that if he was given

00:27:35.749 --> 00:27:40.304
the choice between justice and
his mother he would take his

00:27:40.304 --> 00:27:41.090
mother.

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:48.224
But lots of people there were
again these café

00:27:48.224 --> 00:27:52.776
owners, were people of modest
of means who were simply caught

00:27:52.776 --> 00:27:57.808
in the middle of all of this.
Now, on March 13th,

00:27:57.808 --> 00:28:04.195
1958, a protest demonstration
by French settlers,

00:28:04.195 --> 00:28:09.032
the colons,
in Algiers, turned into a

00:28:09.032 --> 00:28:13.690
military led insurrection
against the French government.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:18.349
A committee of public safety,
but not a leftwing one but a

00:28:18.349 --> 00:28:22.027
rightwing one,
of rightists seized power--this

00:28:22.027 --> 00:28:26.523
is in Algeria--and there was a
distinct possibility of a

00:28:26.523 --> 00:28:30.119
military coup d'état in
France.

00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:32.279
I have a friend called Maurice
Gardin who's been in the

00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:34.431
ministry, he's now retired,
but is an academic,

00:28:34.431 --> 00:28:37.300
and when he was in the army
back in those days he was in

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.559
Dijon,
and they had--or he was in the

00:28:39.559 --> 00:28:43.020
air force--and he had--they were
told to park planes on the

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.421
runways in Dijon--and this
happened in very many places in

00:28:46.421 --> 00:28:50.299
France because it seemed quite
likely that the paras,

00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:51.980
that is the French
paratroopers,

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.232
were going to be landing and
that there would be civil war in

00:28:55.232 --> 00:28:58.375
France between the army and
those army elements that didn't

00:28:58.375 --> 00:29:01.641
go along with all of this,
and those intellectuals,

00:29:01.641 --> 00:29:04.065
and the communists,
and the socialists,

00:29:04.065 --> 00:29:07.678
and all these other people;
though a lot of the socialists

00:29:07.678 --> 00:29:09.829
were quite ambivalent about all
this.

00:29:09.829 --> 00:29:13.298
Now, Charles de Gaulle,
who had gone off to his small

00:29:13.298 --> 00:29:15.899
house in a place called
Colombey-les-Deu

00:29:15.899 --> 00:29:19.603
x-Églises,
after he didn't get his way,

00:29:19.603 --> 00:29:22.729
as you know,
right after World War Two,

00:29:22.729 --> 00:29:27.089
announced that he was ready to
serve France again.

00:29:27.089 --> 00:29:32.241
Many politicians who had real
reasons to fear a seizure of

00:29:32.241 --> 00:29:36.524
power by the military,
they believed that only the

00:29:36.524 --> 00:29:40.910
towering figure of Charles de
Gaulle could save France.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:45.551
And on May 29th,
1958, President René

00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:50.084
Coty, c-o-t-y,
perfume, appointed de Gaulle

00:29:50.084 --> 00:29:53.803
premier,
a move approved by the National

00:29:53.803 --> 00:29:58.117
Assembly in early June.
He accepted on condition that

00:29:58.117 --> 00:30:02.151
he could rule by emergency
decree for six months,

00:30:02.151 --> 00:30:07.109
and then asked the nation to
approve a new constitution.

00:30:07.109 --> 00:30:10.553
Now, de Gaulle had always
insisted that France needed a

00:30:10.553 --> 00:30:14.466
stronger executive authority,
that the Third Republic had

00:30:14.466 --> 00:30:17.765
fallen, basically,
because no there weren't any

00:30:17.765 --> 00:30:22.069
strong leaders to make what he
considered the right decisions

00:30:22.069 --> 00:30:25.046
in the 1930s,
but because of the fear of

00:30:25.046 --> 00:30:28.547
Caesarism, of Napoleons,
of Boulanger and of these kind

00:30:28.547 --> 00:30:30.699
of strong types,
or of Vichy,

00:30:30.699 --> 00:30:33.226
for that matter,
of Pétain,

00:30:33.226 --> 00:30:36.980
the President of France had
very little power;

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:42.380
power remained in the Chamber
of Deputies.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.179
Now, the Right,
including the army,

00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:49.049
was delighted to have de
Gaulle, the big guy,

00:30:49.049 --> 00:30:52.892
serving in what they assumed
would be a more or less

00:30:52.892 --> 00:30:57.413
permanent or lengthy capacity
until a new constitution with a

00:30:57.413 --> 00:31:01.030
strong executive authority could
be written.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.785
He was one of theirs.
He was wounded on a bridge in

00:31:04.785 --> 00:31:08.935
Dinant, not the two French
Dinan, but the Dinant in--with a

00:31:08.935 --> 00:31:12.799
t, Belgium, at the very
beginning of World War Two.

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:15.842
He was born,
had been born in the fortress

00:31:15.842 --> 00:31:19.034
town of Lille,
not too far away from the big

00:31:19.034 --> 00:31:21.779
garrisons and the big fort
there,

00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:27.704
and surely de Gaulle would want
Algeria to remain

00:31:27.704 --> 00:31:31.804
French--wouldn't he?
Now, the new constitution

00:31:31.804 --> 00:31:34.130
increased the authority of the
president.

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:36.040
It was written by Michel
Debré,

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.137
by the way, whose son is a very
important Gaullist--well it's

00:31:39.137 --> 00:31:44.109
not called Gaullist anymore,
but UMP leader in France now.

00:31:44.109 --> 00:31:48.783
What it did is it set the term
of the presidency at seven

00:31:48.783 --> 00:31:52.706
years--it's gone back to five
now--and ended the

00:31:52.706 --> 00:31:57.418
revolving-door ministries.
And presidents under the Fifth

00:31:57.418 --> 00:32:00.435
Republic could now conduct
foreign policy,

00:32:00.435 --> 00:32:04.042
they appoint prime ministers
and they can dissolve

00:32:04.042 --> 00:32:06.766
parliament.
In September 1958 eighty

00:32:06.766 --> 00:32:10.440
percent of the population
approved the constitution of the

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.099
Fifth Republic.
But what about Algeria?

00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:17.784
Now, the Algerian situation was
different than any other war of

00:32:17.784 --> 00:32:20.339
independence that had been
fought before,

00:32:20.339 --> 00:32:23.745
and there was an
internationalization of that

00:32:23.745 --> 00:32:25.456
war.
There's a brilliant book on

00:32:25.456 --> 00:32:27.856
this by a guy called Matthew
Connolly, who teaches at

00:32:27.856 --> 00:32:30.305
Columbia,
who was a graduate student

00:32:30.305 --> 00:32:34.533
here, and what the National
Liberation Front in Algeria was

00:32:34.533 --> 00:32:38.543
able to do was to mobilize
newspapers of the Left and of

00:32:38.543 --> 00:32:42.297
the Center,
and to use this sort of

00:32:42.297 --> 00:32:48.372
publicity machine to excite
worldwide attention against

00:32:48.372 --> 00:32:51.980
torture,
against the abuses of civilians.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.632
There was an
internationalization of that

00:32:55.632 --> 00:33:01.475
war, and this goes a long way to
try to help the situation of the

00:33:01.475 --> 00:33:05.310
rebels, of the insurgents,
in Algeria.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:10.845
Now, so, what's he going to do?
So, on the 4th of June,

00:33:10.845 --> 00:33:14.393
1958, he goes to Algiers,
and he's welcomed by the

00:33:14.393 --> 00:33:17.046
throngs;
not the Algerians but the

00:33:17.046 --> 00:33:19.120
colons.
By the way, the

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.964
harkis--two names I need
to explain--the harkis

00:33:22.964 --> 00:33:26.039
were the Algerians who fought
for the French,

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:29.956
and if they stayed in Algeria
after the war they are toast,

00:33:29.956 --> 00:33:32.319
and so they--and then the
French,

00:33:32.319 --> 00:33:35.081
what they did is they brought
them back and put them in not

00:33:35.081 --> 00:33:37.230
really internment camps,
but sort of;

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.373
they put them into areas,
kind of reserved areas for

00:33:40.373 --> 00:33:43.763
them, and of course their
relations with other Algerians

00:33:43.763 --> 00:33:46.777
are not very good,
and it's a very awkward

00:33:46.777 --> 00:33:49.074
situation.
The other name up here is

00:33:49.074 --> 00:33:52.443
Massu, who is one of the chief
torturers, who just died a

00:33:52.443 --> 00:33:54.609
couple of years ago,
in the army.

00:33:54.609 --> 00:33:57.894
So, he goes to Algeria and he
says, he gives this classic

00:33:57.894 --> 00:34:01.736
speech of non-committal.
He told the settlers on the 4th

00:34:01.736 --> 00:34:04.501
of June, 1958,
"I have understood you,

00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:07.640
I know what you have tried to
do here."

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:12.507
But he'd already decided that
the costs of France continuing

00:34:12.507 --> 00:34:16.460
the war were too great,
that the war was too decisive,

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.862
and he removed many of the
generals responsible for the

00:34:19.862 --> 00:34:22.949
coup d'état in Algeria
from their post.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:26.097
For somebody for whom
nationalism, as we'll see on

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:29.887
Wednesday, underlay his basic
philosophy of life this seemed

00:34:29.887 --> 00:34:34.363
to be an astonishing turnaround,
a stab in the back by a

00:34:34.363 --> 00:34:37.716
military man.
And as the Dreyfus Affair had

00:34:37.716 --> 00:34:40.877
revealed in the 1890s,
and the Vichy years had

00:34:40.877 --> 00:34:43.702
confirmed,
a rightwing anti-democratic

00:34:43.702 --> 00:34:46.466
tradition survived in the
officer corps,

00:34:46.466 --> 00:34:49.300
and so they felt absolutely
betrayed.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.279
And, so, the OAS,
which had already existed,

00:34:52.279 --> 00:34:55.190
in reality they tried to kill
de Gaulle.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:59.033
The closest they get is at a
place called Clamart,

00:34:59.033 --> 00:35:02.641
outside of Paris,
where they machinegun his big

00:35:02.641 --> 00:35:05.150
limousine,
and there's twenty or thirty

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.968
bullet holes in there;
and it's hard to miss a guy

00:35:07.968 --> 00:35:10.732
who's sort of power-forward
size, 6'7, a huge,

00:35:10.732 --> 00:35:13.927
huge man, but he emerges
unscathed--it was absolutely

00:35:13.927 --> 00:35:16.606
incredible.
And they plant bombs in

00:35:16.606 --> 00:35:20.737
Paris--this is terrorism--to
blow up and to terrorize the

00:35:20.737 --> 00:35:24.306
population.
De Gaulle assumes emergency

00:35:24.306 --> 00:35:27.501
powers again,
this time for a year,

00:35:27.501 --> 00:35:31.260
but not in the interests of the
army.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.965
His interest is to pull
France--this is the ultimate in

00:35:34.965 --> 00:35:38.739
realpolitik--is to pull
France out of Algeria.

00:35:38.739 --> 00:35:42.971
And there's a vote for Algerian
independence held in 1961,

00:35:42.971 --> 00:35:47.425
in July, and fifteen million
vote oui and five million

00:35:47.425 --> 00:35:51.553
vote non.
And there's a new attempt in

00:35:51.553 --> 00:35:57.030
Algeria by army officers to
organize an insurrection and is

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:01.090
soon put down,
and Algeria becomes free.

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:04.587
Now, in the last minute that
remains to me,

00:36:04.587 --> 00:36:08.085
that I have left,
one of the things that is

00:36:08.085 --> 00:36:11.940
interesting now in the last,
well, twenty years,

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.324
is that when the National
Front, the rightwing party of

00:36:15.324 --> 00:36:17.874
Jean-Marie Le Pen,
who had dismissed,

00:36:17.874 --> 00:36:21.644
by the way the death camps and
the Holocaust as a "minor

00:36:21.644 --> 00:36:25.346
detail"--I'm quoting him
exactly--and who applauded the

00:36:25.346 --> 00:36:29.460
drowning of immigrants in the
Seine River by his thugs,

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:34.788
when he first came to the
attention of the world with a

00:36:34.788 --> 00:36:39.130
series of astonishing electoral
victories,

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:42.566
or at least good showings in
various places in France,

00:36:42.566 --> 00:36:45.030
one of the things that people
first,

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.860
who followed it,
first noted is that he didn't

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.635
do that well in the--any more
than anywhere else--in the more

00:36:51.635 --> 00:36:54.340
traditionally Catholic parts of
France,

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.351
that is Brittany or one of the
departments where he had his

00:36:57.351 --> 00:36:59.328
first big success,
near Chartres,

00:36:59.328 --> 00:37:02.871
in a place called Dru;
but the places that he did

00:37:02.871 --> 00:37:06.951
astoundingly well were on the
Mediterranean and in the

00:37:06.951 --> 00:37:10.800
Vaucluse, that is where Avignon
is, and Orange.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.792
Why?
It's not the large immigrant

00:37:14.792 --> 00:37:18.565
populations from North Africa
who are voting for somebody that

00:37:18.565 --> 00:37:22.400
wants to drown them or send them
back to where they came from--

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.474
they're not voting for him.
The people that voted for him

00:37:26.474 --> 00:37:31.025
massively are the colons,
the pieds-noirs--not all

00:37:31.025 --> 00:37:33.838
of them,
but it was they who had to

00:37:33.838 --> 00:37:36.322
leave, in 1960,
and '61, and '62,

00:37:36.322 --> 00:37:39.039
in many cases getting out
quick,

00:37:39.039 --> 00:37:42.251
packing up photos,
whatever they could take with

00:37:42.251 --> 00:37:44.780
them, in some cases,
extreme cases,

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.565
and going to France where they
bought cafés,

00:37:48.565 --> 00:37:50.610
orange groves,
et cetera.

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:53.250
And they remembered and they
hated.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:57.525
And that's what changed in a
dramatic way an area that had

00:37:57.525 --> 00:38:00.565
always been leftwing,
at least since the middle of

00:38:00.565 --> 00:38:03.008
the nineteenth century,
and turns it into the bastion

00:38:03.008 --> 00:38:04.981
of,
for awhile, of the National

00:38:04.981 --> 00:38:07.296
Front.
And then things got more

00:38:07.296 --> 00:38:12.302
complicated, but it went back to
these events in Algeria and what

00:38:12.302 --> 00:38:15.367
happened there,
that shaped not only France,

00:38:15.367 --> 00:38:17.380
but movements in other
countries.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.846
See you on Wednesday.

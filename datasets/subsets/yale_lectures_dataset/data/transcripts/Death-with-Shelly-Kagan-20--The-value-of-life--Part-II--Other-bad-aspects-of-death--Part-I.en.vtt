00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.946
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Last time, I invited you to

00:00:03.946 --> 00:00:06.080
think about life on the
experience machine,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.180
where the scientists are busy
stimulating your brain in such a

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.975
way as to give you an exact
replica, from the insides of

00:00:11.975 --> 00:00:14.821
what it would be like having
identical experiences to the

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:17.362
ones you would have if you were
really doing--well,

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:19.700
whatever it is that's worth
doing.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.981
Climbing the alps,
writing the great American

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:26.262
novel, raising a great family
that loves you,

00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:29.133
being creative.
Whatever it is you think is

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.341
worth having,
the experience machine gives

00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:33.980
you all the experiential side of
those things.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.700
But you're not really doing
those things.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.420
You're actually just floating
in the scientist's lab.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.958
And we ask ourselves,
would you want to live a life

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.515
on the experience machine?
Would you be happy or would you

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:49.922
be unhappy, to discover that you
actually have been living a life

00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:53.403
on the experience machine?
Most of us, when we think about

00:00:53.403 --> 00:00:56.227
this, find ourselves wanting to
say, no, we wouldn't want to

00:00:56.227 --> 00:00:58.190
have a life on the experience
machine.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.443
I've been discussing this sort
of example for many,

00:01:01.443 --> 00:01:04.081
many years.
And there's always a group of

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:06.800
people who think,
yes, life on the experience

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.136
machine is perfect as long as
you've got the right tape

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.861
playing.
But the vast majority always

00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:16.430
says, no, there's something
missing from that life.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.409
It's not the ideal of human
existences;

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.189
it's not the best possible life
we can imagine ourselves having.

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:25.769
But that means,
if we think something's

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:28.180
missing, we then have to ask
yourselves, what's missing?

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.180
What's wrong with the
experience machine?

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.150
The one thing we can conclude
immediately is,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.523
if you think life on the
experience machine is missing

00:01:35.523 --> 00:01:38.102
something,
that the hedonist--and views

00:01:38.102 --> 00:01:42.077
like hedonism--must be wrong,
insofar as they say that all

00:01:42.077 --> 00:01:45.285
that matters for the best
possible life is--for

00:01:45.285 --> 00:01:49.400
well-being--is getting the right
kinds of experiences,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.069
getting the right kinds of
mental states.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.358
Because by hypothesis,
the experience machine gets the

00:01:56.358 --> 00:02:00.000
mental states right,
get the insides right.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.040
So, if something's missing from
that life, there's more to the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.079
best kind of life than just
having the right mental states,

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.900
than just getting the insides
right.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.490
Well, we ask ourselves then,
well, what's missing?

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.250
I think different people will
answer that in different ways.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.886
And if we had more time we
could spell out rival theories

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:21.614
of well-being,
which could be interestingly

00:02:21.614 --> 00:02:25.575
distinguished one from another
in terms of how they answer the

00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:28.224
question,
"What's missing from the

00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:30.573
experience machine?"
on the one hand,

00:02:30.573 --> 00:02:33.830
and "Why are the things that
are missing from the experience

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.503
machine worth having?"
Different theories of

00:02:36.503 --> 00:02:39.460
well-being might answer that in
different ways.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.822
Instead of trying to pursue
those alternative theories in a

00:02:42.822 --> 00:02:45.933
systematic fashion,
let me just gesture toward some

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:49.720
of the things that seem to be
missing from that kind of life.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.105
Well, first of all,
and most, perhaps,

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:55.652
obviously--if you're just
spending your life floating in

00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:58.609
the scientist's lab,
you're not actually

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.304
accomplishing anything.
You're not actually getting the

00:03:02.304 --> 00:03:05.330
things out of life you thought
you were getting.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.011
You wanted to be climbing the
mountain, but you're not

00:03:08.011 --> 00:03:11.189
actually climbing a mountain.
You're just floating there.

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.852
You wanted to be writing the
great American novel,

00:03:13.852 --> 00:03:16.570
but you're not writing the
great American novel.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.192
You're just floating there.
You wanted to be finding the

00:03:19.192 --> 00:03:21.681
cure for cancer,
but you're not actually finding

00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:24.667
the cure for cancer.
You wanted to be loved,

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:28.280
but you're not actually loved.
You're just floating there.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.210
Nobody other than the scientist
even knows that you exist.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.620
So, there's a variety of things
you wanted.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.507
You wanted to know your place
in the universe,

00:03:38.507 --> 00:03:42.099
but you don't even have that
kind of knowledge either,

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.196
because you think you're
writing novels,

00:03:44.196 --> 00:03:47.099
finding the cure for cancer,
climbing Mount Everest.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.259
You're completely deceived
about all those things.

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:54.337
So you don't have the kind of
self-knowledge that many of us

00:03:54.337 --> 00:03:55.922
value.
Well, as I say,

00:03:55.922 --> 00:04:00.051
different theories would try to
systematize these examples in

00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:02.801
different ways;
that we don't have any kind of

00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:04.817
accomplishments,
we don't have knowledge,

00:04:04.817 --> 00:04:07.639
we're not in the right kinds of
loving relationships.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.329
Different theories might have
different explanations as

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.969
to--are these things valuable
because we want them,

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.339
or do we want them because we
recognize they're valuable?

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.783
Rather than trying to pursue
those questions--,

00:04:18.783 --> 00:04:22.076
And indeed, trying to work out
the details of these views would

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:24.704
be complicated as well.
Take the example of

00:04:24.704 --> 00:04:26.740
accomplishment.
Well, we all think

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.004
accomplishment's important,
but it's not as though any old

00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:33.919
accomplishment is important.
If somebody sets themselves--or

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.199
so it seems to me at least--if
somebody sets theirself the goal

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.271
of making the biggest rubber
band ball in the Eastern United

00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:44.568
States,
I suppose there's a sense of

00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:47.295
the word that that's an
accomplishment if they've got

00:04:47.295 --> 00:04:49.256
it,
but it doesn't strike me as the

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:52.017
kind of accomplishment which
makes for a particularly

00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:53.968
valuable life.
So, we might have to

00:04:53.968 --> 00:04:56.852
distinguish between any old
accomplishment and genuinely

00:04:56.852 --> 00:05:00.557
valuable accomplishments.
But again, just put those

00:05:00.557 --> 00:05:03.460
details aside.
We can say that there are

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.206
certain things that are good
above and beyond

00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:09.140
experiences--the right kinds of
accomplishments,

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.759
the right kind of knowledge.
After all, not every bit of

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.902
knowledge is equally valuable.
It's one thing to know your

00:05:15.902 --> 00:05:18.558
place in the universe,
or to know the fundamental laws

00:05:18.558 --> 00:05:21.670
of physics.
It's another thing to know what

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.170
was the average rainfall in
Bangkok in 1984.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.669
I'm not clear that that kind of
knowledge gives a whole lot of

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.283
value to your life.
So, we need the right kinds of

00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:33.790
accomplishments and the right
kind of knowledge and the right

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.547
kinds of relationships.
But imagine you've worked that

00:05:37.547 --> 00:05:39.647
out.
The crucial point is that it

00:05:39.647 --> 00:05:43.411
takes more to have the best kind
of life than just getting the

00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:46.428
insides right.
It also requires getting the

00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:50.507
outsides right--whatever that
comes to--having in your life

00:05:50.507 --> 00:05:54.093
not just experiences but the
right kinds of goods or

00:05:54.093 --> 00:05:57.750
accomplishments or whatever term
we use for it.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.562
Now, let's say,
instead of pursuing the

00:05:59.562 --> 00:06:01.899
questions of how exactly that
theory should go,

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:05.672
notice that if we had that
theory we could still evaluate

00:06:05.672 --> 00:06:09.310
in principle--whatever the
practical difficulties might

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.149
be--in principle we could still
evaluate rival lives.

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:17.614
We could talk about adding up
all the positive experiences

00:06:17.614 --> 00:06:21.529
along with all the--ask yourself
how many goods,

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:25.560
how many accomplishments of the
right sort were in that life?

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.769
And that's on the positive side
of the ledger.

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:32.151
And against that we would then
have to subtract the sum total

00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:35.476
of the negative experiences,
all the failures and deceptions

00:06:35.476 --> 00:06:38.206
or what have you.
Those would count against the

00:06:38.206 --> 00:06:41.683
overall value of your life.
We could still say it's--how

00:06:41.683 --> 00:06:44.941
good your life is,
is a matter of adding up the

00:06:44.941 --> 00:06:48.599
goods and subtracting the bads.
But we would now have a

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:50.773
somewhat broader,
or more encompassing or

00:06:50.773 --> 00:06:52.298
inclusive,
list of goods,

00:06:52.298 --> 00:06:55.219
and a more broad and
encompassing list of bads--not

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:58.600
just experience,
but also these various other

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.006
accomplishments,
whatever exactly that list

00:07:02.006 --> 00:07:04.876
comes to.
So, we could still evaluate

00:07:04.876 --> 00:07:07.827
rival lives.
My life would've gone better

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:12.192
had I chosen to become a farmer
instead of chosen to become a

00:07:12.192 --> 00:07:14.482
doctor.
Or my life would've gone better

00:07:14.482 --> 00:07:17.306
for this period of ten years,
but then it would've become

00:07:17.306 --> 00:07:18.629
worse.
Or what have you.

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:22.501
Or when we ask ourselves,
how will things go for me over

00:07:22.501 --> 00:07:26.936
the next couple of weeks if I go
on vacation versus staying back

00:07:26.936 --> 00:07:28.991
here?
We add up the goods,

00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:33.469
subtract the bads--whatever our
favorite list is--and we come to

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:37.520
our best educated guess about
the rival evaluations of not

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.180
just lives as a whole,
but chunks of lives.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.670
Now, what do those totals come
to?

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.650
Well, you might think it's an
empirical question,

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.754
and in fact I am inclined to
think it's an empirical

00:07:50.754 --> 00:07:52.569
question, varying from person to
person.

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:56.320
But it's worth taking a moment
to flag the fact that there are

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.887
people, there are philosophers,
who think we can generalize

00:07:59.887 --> 00:08:03.788
across all humans.
You might say that optimists

00:08:03.788 --> 00:08:08.613
are people who think that for
everybody in every case,

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:13.620
in every circumstance,
the total is always positive.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:18.566
"Life's always worth living;
it's always better than

00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:21.900
non-existence."
That's what the optimist

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.688
thinks--not just for themselves
individually,

00:08:24.688 --> 00:08:27.920
but for everybody,
the total is always positive.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.879
Against that,
I suppose, you've got

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:32.299
pessimists--pessimists who say,
"No, no.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.418
Although life perhaps has some
good things, the overall grand

00:08:36.418 --> 00:08:40.399
balance is negative for
everybody in every circumstance.

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:43.317
We'd all be better off dead,
or perhaps more accurately

00:08:43.317 --> 00:08:46.505
still, all be better off never
having been born in the first

00:08:46.505 --> 00:08:48.799
place."
That's what the pessimists say.

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:53.306
And in between the optimists on
the one hand and the pessimists

00:08:53.306 --> 00:08:56.359
on the other,
you've got moderates who say,

00:08:56.359 --> 00:08:59.309
"It varies.
And for some people the balance

00:08:59.309 --> 00:09:03.029
is positive, for some people
perhaps the balance is negative,

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:05.834
whether for their life as a
whole or for certain stretches

00:09:05.834 --> 00:09:08.492
of their lives."
We then have to get down to

00:09:08.492 --> 00:09:11.710
facts about cases,
try to describe the instance,

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.855
perhaps somebody who's in the
terminal stages of some illness

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:18.620
where they're in a great deal of
pain.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.888
And the various other external
goods of life,

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:22.950
they can't--because they're
bedridden,

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.242
they can no longer accomplish
things, perhaps their family has

00:09:26.242 --> 00:09:29.341
abandoned them.
Whatever the details might be,

00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:33.487
we could describe lives and
say, whether or not their life

00:09:33.487 --> 00:09:38.226
was good as a whole,
what the future holds out for

00:09:38.226 --> 00:09:42.308
them is negative.
That's what the moderates would

00:09:42.308 --> 00:09:46.000
say.
It varies from case to case.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.576
Well, however we settle that
issue, notice there's still one

00:09:51.576 --> 00:09:57.720
other assumption that all these
positions still have in common.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.784
We've expanded our list of
goods so that--Nobody's going to

00:10:01.784 --> 00:10:05.638
deny that among the goods of
life are pleasure and other

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:09.073
positive experiences.
And among the bads of life are

00:10:09.073 --> 00:10:11.149
pain and other negative
experiences.

00:10:11.149 --> 00:10:15.604
But we've expanded the list of
goods so it includes external

00:10:15.604 --> 00:10:19.529
goods and not only experiential
or internal goods.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:23.332
Still, the views that I've been
sketching all still have the

00:10:23.332 --> 00:10:28.525
following assumption in common.
How good it is to be alive is a

00:10:28.525 --> 00:10:34.262
matter of adding up all of
the--call it the contents

00:10:34.262 --> 00:10:37.789
of life.
Add up your experiences and

00:10:37.789 --> 00:10:43.119
your accomplishments and the
particular details of your life

00:10:43.119 --> 00:10:48.214
as what the story is about.
It's as though we've been

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:53.174
assuming, and I have been
assuming up to this moment,

00:10:53.174 --> 00:10:56.990
that being alive per se has no
value.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:02.104
It's--life itself is a
container which we fill with

00:11:02.104 --> 00:11:06.532
various goods or bads.
And deciding how valuable it

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:10.831
is, how good it is for me to be
alive is a matter of adding up

00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:13.720
the value of the contents of the
life.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.460
But the container itself is a
mere container.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.200
It has no value in and of
itself.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.833
We could say that what I've
been presupposing up to this

00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:30.139
point is the "neutral container
theory" of the value of life.

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:34.259
Hedonism is a version of the
neutral container theory.

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:38.235
How valuable--how well off you
are, how valuable your life is,

00:11:38.235 --> 00:11:42.080
is a function of the contents,
the pleasure and the pain.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.273
We've expanded the list of
goods that can go within

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:49.890
your life, but for all that,
we've still been acting as

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.090
though the neutral container
theory is the right approach.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.889
But against this there are
those who think,

00:11:55.889 --> 00:11:59.690
no, in addition to thinking
about the value of the content

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:03.115
of life,
we have to remember--so these

00:12:03.115 --> 00:12:07.460
people claim--that life itself
is worth having.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.678
There's a benefit to me above
and beyond the question of

00:12:11.678 --> 00:12:15.129
what's going on within my
life--am I loved,

00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:17.898
am I accomplishing things,
am I having nice experiences or

00:12:17.898 --> 00:12:20.742
not?
Above and beyond the question

00:12:20.742 --> 00:12:25.584
of the contents of my life,
we have to remember that the

00:12:25.584 --> 00:12:30.250
mere fact that I'm alive gives
my life some value.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.480
So, these are "valuable
container" theories.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.326
Now, think about what it would
mean to accept a valuable

00:12:35.326 --> 00:12:39.469
container theory.
You're saying that being alive

00:12:39.469 --> 00:12:43.882
per se has some positive value.
Well, actually,

00:12:43.882 --> 00:12:47.428
the first remark is,
probably wouldn't be completely

00:12:47.428 --> 00:12:50.348
accurate to say,
to describe these views as

00:12:50.348 --> 00:12:53.059
saying, "It's being alive per
se."

00:12:53.059 --> 00:12:57.800
After all, a blade of grass is
alive, and I presume that even

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.700
fans of the, what we might call
valuable container theories,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.159
don't think that,
"Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:08.421
if--as long as I was alive in
the way that a blade of grass is

00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:10.745
alive."
Life may have value in and of

00:13:10.745 --> 00:13:13.080
itself, but it's not mere
life.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.629
What we want is the life of a
human.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:20.261
We want a life in which we're
accomplishing things,

00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:23.820
there's agency,
and the life of knowing things.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.759
Because you have to be a knower
in order to have knowledge.

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:30.120
The life of somebody who can
have an emotional side.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.514
So, it's something like the
life of a person that,

00:13:33.514 --> 00:13:36.354
when we say,
when there are people who are

00:13:36.354 --> 00:13:39.660
inclined to say,
that being alive per so is

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:44.165
valuable, presumably what they
mean is being alive as a person

00:13:44.165 --> 00:13:46.220
per se is valuable.
All right.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.399
Note that point;
keep it in mind.

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:53.974
For simplicity I'll talk about
these views as though they say

00:13:53.974 --> 00:13:59.205
life per se is valuable.
Actually, I suppose there could

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:03.380
be a more extreme view still.
It seems implausible to me,

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.226
but I suppose it's worth
noticing there are people who

00:14:06.226 --> 00:14:08.307
think,
"No, being alive per se,

00:14:08.307 --> 00:14:11.836
right--even though there I am
and my brain has been so

00:14:11.836 --> 00:14:15.297
thoroughly destroyed that I'm
not longer able to know

00:14:15.297 --> 00:14:17.562
anything,
no longer able to relate

00:14:17.562 --> 00:14:20.393
emotionally to anybody,
no longer able to accomplish

00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:23.139
anything,
there I am in a persistent

00:14:23.139 --> 00:14:26.580
vegetative state,
but at least I'm alive."

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.799
You can imagine somebody who
has that view.

00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:31.950
I've got to say I find that a
pretty implausible view.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.878
So I'm going to restrict
myself, at least when I think

00:14:35.878 --> 00:14:40.325
about it, to versions that say,
it's the life of a person per

00:14:40.325 --> 00:14:45.291
se that's valuable.
Now, notice that if we accept

00:14:45.291 --> 00:14:51.815
this view to decide how well off
I am, or somebody else is,

00:14:51.815 --> 00:14:57.440
you can't just add up the
contents of the life.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.963
You can't just add up all the
pleasures and subtract the

00:14:59.963 --> 00:15:02.533
pains, or add up all the
accomplishments and subtract the

00:15:02.533 --> 00:15:05.515
failures,
or add up all the knowledge and

00:15:05.515 --> 00:15:08.440
subtract the ignorance and
deception.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:13.316
Doing that in terms of the
contents gives you a subtotal,

00:15:13.316 --> 00:15:17.669
but that subtotal is no longer
the entire story.

00:15:17.669 --> 00:15:21.879
Because we also have to add in,
if we accept a valuable

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:25.310
container theory,
we also have to add in some

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:29.909
extra positive points to take
account of the fact that,

00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:34.113
well, at least you're alive or
have the life or a person--or

00:15:34.113 --> 00:15:38.460
whatever it is that you think is
valuable in and of itself.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.490
So first we get the content
subtotal;

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:45.630
then we add some extra points
for the mere fact that you're

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.785
alive.
Now, notice that since we are

00:15:48.785 --> 00:15:53.169
adding extra positive facts,
extra positive points,

00:15:53.169 --> 00:15:59.573
for the fact that you're alive,
even if the contents subtotal

00:15:59.573 --> 00:16:06.190
is negative, the grand
total could still be positive.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:11.015
Suppose that being alive per se
is worth plus a hundred points,

00:16:11.015 --> 00:16:15.632
just to make up some number.
Even if your content subtotal

00:16:15.632 --> 00:16:19.175
was negative ten,
that doesn't mean you're not

00:16:19.175 --> 00:16:22.368
better off alive,
because negative ten plus the

00:16:22.368 --> 00:16:25.604
extra hundred points for the
mere fact that you're alive is

00:16:25.604 --> 00:16:28.060
still going to give you a
positive total,

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.210
plus 90.

00:16:32.169 --> 00:16:37.187
So, the point of thinking about
the possibility of accepting a

00:16:37.187 --> 00:16:42.205
valuable container theory is to
remind us that in deciding are

00:16:42.205 --> 00:16:46.209
you better off dead,
has death deprived me of

00:16:46.209 --> 00:16:50.269
something good or not,
it's important to not just

00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:54.752
focus on the contents but to
also remember to add some

00:16:54.752 --> 00:16:59.827
positive points above and beyond
the content subtotal to take

00:16:59.827 --> 00:17:05.410
into account the value of the
sheer fact that you're alive.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.530
If you're a fan of the neutral
container theory,

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.447
you won't have anything extra
to add, because life per se is

00:17:12.447 --> 00:17:15.733
just a zero.
It's strictly a matter of the

00:17:15.733 --> 00:17:17.795
contents.
But if you accept a valuable

00:17:17.795 --> 00:17:20.109
container theory,
you have to add something more.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.587
And so even if,
you might say,

00:17:22.587 --> 00:17:27.372
the way my life is going in
terms of its contents is bad,

00:17:27.372 --> 00:17:31.730
being alive per se might still
be a good thing.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.509
Have to add some extra points.
How much extra?

00:17:35.509 --> 00:17:40.475
Well, here we're going to have,
of course, more modest and more

00:17:40.475 --> 00:17:44.400
bold versions of the valuable
container theory.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.650
Let me just distinguish two
broad types.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:55.354
What we might call modest
versions of the valuable

00:17:55.354 --> 00:18:01.292
container theory say,
although being alive per se is

00:18:01.292 --> 00:18:05.828
good,
if the contents of your life

00:18:05.828 --> 00:18:11.435
get bad enough,
that can outweigh the value of

00:18:11.435 --> 00:18:17.789
being alive so that the grand
total is negative.

00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:22.970
Modest container theories,
that is, say there's a

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:27.397
value to being alive,
but it can in principle be

00:18:27.397 --> 00:18:30.137
outweighed.
Whether it gets outweighed

00:18:30.137 --> 00:18:33.200
easily, or whether it's very,
very difficult and the contents

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.140
have to be horrible to outweigh
it,

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:40.130
depends on how much value you
think being alive per se has.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.424
So, those are modest
theories--positive value for

00:18:43.424 --> 00:18:46.796
life, but it can be outweighed.
Against that,

00:18:46.796 --> 00:18:51.734
you can imagine someone who
thinks being alive per se is so

00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:56.587
incredibly valuable that no
matter how horrible the

00:18:56.587 --> 00:19:01.637
contents are,
the grand total will always be

00:19:01.637 --> 00:19:04.915
positive.
It's as though being alive is

00:19:04.915 --> 00:19:08.618
infinitely valuable in
comparison to questions about

00:19:08.618 --> 00:19:12.172
the contents.
We could call this the

00:19:12.172 --> 00:19:18.046
"fantastic valuable container
theory" as opposed to the

00:19:18.046 --> 00:19:22.180
"modest valuable container
theory."

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.013
I suppose that label gives away
where I want to come down on

00:19:25.013 --> 00:19:27.935
this.
I find the fantastic valuable

00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:32.839
container theory fantastic in
the sense of incredible.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:38.610
I can't bring myself to believe
it, which--I have some

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:43.509
sympathies for valuable
container theories,

00:19:43.509 --> 00:19:49.140
but I also have some sympathy
for neutral container theories.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.180
Sometimes I'm drawn toward the
neutral view;

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.017
sometimes I'm drawn toward the
thought that being alive per se

00:19:55.017 --> 00:19:57.732
is good for you.
But even in those moments when

00:19:57.732 --> 00:20:00.106
I'm drawn towards valuable
container theories,

00:20:00.106 --> 00:20:04.568
it's always the modest version.
I don't find myself drawn

00:20:04.568 --> 00:20:09.247
toward the fantastic version.
Now, if we make these

00:20:09.247 --> 00:20:12.133
distinctions,
then again, remembering that

00:20:12.133 --> 00:20:15.159
the question we've been asking
ourselves is,

00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:19.788
"So why is death bad?"
The deprivation account says,

00:20:19.788 --> 00:20:25.339
death is bad for you insofar
as, or it's bad for you when,

00:20:25.339 --> 00:20:29.501
by virtue of dying now,
what you've been deprived of

00:20:29.501 --> 00:20:34.315
is, another chunk of life that
would've been good for you to

00:20:34.315 --> 00:20:36.970
have.
And what we now see is that--to

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.562
see whether that could be the
case or not, we've got to get

00:20:40.562 --> 00:20:44.217
clear in our own minds about
whether we believe in a neutral

00:20:44.217 --> 00:20:47.825
container theory,
a positive, valuable container

00:20:47.825 --> 00:20:51.718
theory or--and among those,
between a fantastic and a

00:20:51.718 --> 00:20:55.712
modest container theory.
If we are neutralists,

00:20:55.712 --> 00:20:58.850
we're going to say,
the question is,

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.795
what would the contents of my
life have been,

00:21:02.795 --> 00:21:06.740
for the next year,
ten years, whatever?

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.737
If that would've been worth
having, then--if the next chunk

00:21:10.737 --> 00:21:14.734
of my life would've been worth
having--then it's bad for me

00:21:14.734 --> 00:21:18.869
that I die now instead of living
for the next ten years.

00:21:18.869 --> 00:21:21.847
On the other hand,
if the balance from here on out

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:24.946
would've been negative,
then it's good for me that I

00:21:24.946 --> 00:21:28.410
died now instead of being kept
alive with a life not worth

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.250
living.
That's how the neutralists put

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.964
it.
If we are valuable

00:21:31.964 --> 00:21:35.112
container theorists,
we think the answer has got to

00:21:35.112 --> 00:21:37.339
be,
well, look at the contents,

00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:40.148
but don't forget to add some
extra points,

00:21:40.148 --> 00:21:43.779
even if the next five years for
you would've been,

00:21:43.779 --> 00:21:47.897
in terms of the contents,
modestly bad--perhaps the value

00:21:47.897 --> 00:21:51.279
of at least being alive at all
outweighs it,

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:54.240
so it still would've been
better for you to be alive.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.120
But if the contents get bad
enough, then you'd be better off

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.321
dead.
Notice that on the modest view,

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:06.465
if we ask ourselves,
would it have been good to be

00:22:06.465 --> 00:22:09.206
immortal?
the answer's going to depend on

00:22:09.206 --> 00:22:12.214
not just whether we accept
Bernard Williams' claim that

00:22:12.214 --> 00:22:14.220
immortality would be bad for
you,

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.906
because we now realize that
what Williams was talking about

00:22:17.906 --> 00:22:20.829
was the contents of an
immortal life.

00:22:20.829 --> 00:22:23.143
And that's no longer an
adequate view,

00:22:23.143 --> 00:22:25.831
or at least it's no longer a
complete story,

00:22:25.831 --> 00:22:28.519
if we are valuable container
theorists.

00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:30.545
We could say--you could imagine
somebody saying,

00:22:30.545 --> 00:22:32.009
"Oh yes, you're right,
Williams,

00:22:32.009 --> 00:22:35.494
the contents get negative,
but that's still outweighed by

00:22:35.494 --> 00:22:38.616
the mere fact that you're alive.
So on balance,

00:22:38.616 --> 00:22:40.990
being immortal is a good
thing."

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:46.120
Whether that's right or not
depends on just how bad would it

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.982
be to be immortal.
Because, of course,

00:22:48.982 --> 00:22:51.521
if you're a modest,
if you accept the modest

00:22:51.521 --> 00:22:54.119
version of the valuable
container theory,

00:22:54.119 --> 00:22:56.640
then if the contents get bad
enough,

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.460
that can outweigh the positive
value of life.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.596
Against that,
fans of the fantastic valuable

00:23:02.596 --> 00:23:06.171
container theory can say,
it doesn't really matter

00:23:06.171 --> 00:23:10.757
whether Williams is right.
Even if being immortal would

00:23:10.757 --> 00:23:14.781
become horrendously boring and
tedious or worse,

00:23:14.781 --> 00:23:19.310
it doesn't matter.
The value of being alive per se

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.535
outweighs that.
So you're always better off

00:23:22.535 --> 00:23:25.079
being alive.
So more life would always be

00:23:25.079 --> 00:23:28.299
better, no matter how horrible
the contents might be.

00:23:28.299 --> 00:23:31.289
So being immortal really would
be a good thing for you.

00:23:31.289 --> 00:23:33.980
Death always is a bad
thing.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:38.032
That's what you can say if you
accept the fantastic container

00:23:38.032 --> 00:23:40.270
theory.
I don't find the fantastic

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.410
container theory myself--I don't
find it particularly attractive.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:51.441
I'm inclined to think not only
that--not only that the contents

00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:56.208
of life would be bad,
eventually, for all of us if we

00:23:56.208 --> 00:24:00.176
were immortal--but that it would
be bad enough to outweigh

00:24:00.176 --> 00:24:03.750
whatever value,
whatever positive value being

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:09.093
alive per se may have for us.
So, I'm inclined to think,

00:24:09.093 --> 00:24:14.980
eventually immortality would
always be bad overall.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.533
But let me remind you that
saying that does not rule out

00:24:18.533 --> 00:24:22.603
the possibility of consistently
going on to say that even though

00:24:22.603 --> 00:24:27.709
it's a good thing that we die,
because eventually immortality

00:24:27.709 --> 00:24:33.626
would be horrible--for all that,
death could still come too

00:24:33.626 --> 00:24:38.082
soon.
It could still be the case that

00:24:38.082 --> 00:24:41.799
we die before life has turned
bad.

00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:45.427
We die while it's still the
case that living another ten

00:24:45.427 --> 00:24:48.922
years or twenty years--or for
that matter five hundred

00:24:48.922 --> 00:24:52.880
years--would still or could
still have been good for us.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.417
It's compatible with thinking
that immortality would be bad to

00:24:58.417 --> 00:25:02.230
think that in fact death comes
too soon.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:06.103
But of course,
we now have a return of the

00:25:06.103 --> 00:25:11.299
division between moderates,
optimists and pessimists.

00:25:11.299 --> 00:25:14.194
You might say,
optimists are those--now in

00:25:14.194 --> 00:25:17.160
this more chastened version of
optimism,

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.126
optimists say,
"Even if immortality would be

00:25:20.126 --> 00:25:24.198
bad eventually after a million
years or ten million years or

00:25:24.198 --> 00:25:28.175
what have you,
the next chunk of life would've

00:25:28.175 --> 00:25:31.654
been good for all of us."
So that death--they're

00:25:31.654 --> 00:25:34.830
optimists in this strange sense,
if they think life would've

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.553
been good,
which means of course that

00:25:37.553 --> 00:25:40.200
that we die is bad for
us.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.987
Because we all die too soon.
That's what the optimists might

00:25:44.987 --> 00:25:46.361
say.
Against that,

00:25:46.361 --> 00:25:50.217
the pessimists might say,
"Boy, death comes not a moment

00:25:50.217 --> 00:25:54.267
too soon for any of us.
The next chunk of life is

00:25:54.267 --> 00:25:58.990
always not worth having,
always worse than nothing."

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.973
And in between these two
extremes are the moderates,

00:26:02.973 --> 00:26:06.799
who say, "For some of us,
death comes too soon.

00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:10.010
For some of us,
death does not come too soon."

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.440
There's a quote I want to read.
It's actually out of place now.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.462
I should have read it a lecture
or two ago when I started

00:26:21.462 --> 00:26:24.910
talking about immortality,
but I misplaced it.

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:29.050
So, I found it this morning.
So before I just leave the

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.685
subject of immortality,
let me conclude with some words

00:26:32.685 --> 00:26:35.849
of wisdom from a former Miss USA
contestant.

00:26:35.849 --> 00:26:38.522
She was asked the question,
"Would you want to live

00:26:38.522 --> 00:26:40.383
forever?"
And she responded,

00:26:40.383 --> 00:26:44.061
"I would not live forever,
because we should not live

00:26:44.061 --> 00:26:46.556
forever.
Because if we were supposed to

00:26:46.556 --> 00:26:48.960
live forever,
then we would live forever.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.063
But we cannot live forever,
which is why I would not live

00:26:53.063 --> 00:26:56.870
forever."
Isn't that nice?

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.964
All right.
So I've been talking for,

00:26:59.964 --> 00:27:06.028
actually now a couple of weeks
I suppose, about the central

00:27:06.028 --> 00:27:10.254
badness of death.
Why is it that death is bad for

00:27:10.254 --> 00:27:13.546
me?
And the answer I propose is the

00:27:13.546 --> 00:27:17.663
deprivation account.
The central bad thing about the

00:27:17.663 --> 00:27:21.542
fact that I'm going to die is
the fact that because I'll be

00:27:21.542 --> 00:27:25.019
dead I'll be deprived of the
good things in life.

00:27:25.019 --> 00:27:27.009
And we've now seen that that's
a bit crude, right?

00:27:27.009 --> 00:27:30.125
We have to not talk--just talk
about the good things in the

00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:32.059
life, but the good of life
itself,

00:27:32.059 --> 00:27:34.953
and we have to notice that
perhaps on certain views,

00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:37.619
for certain cases,
it's not really the case that

00:27:37.619 --> 00:27:40.400
when I die I'm being deprived of
a good life.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.902
Because the next chunk,
or perhaps from there on out,

00:27:42.902 --> 00:27:45.724
it would've been bad.
But still, details and

00:27:45.724 --> 00:27:50.089
complications of the sort we've
been considering aside,

00:27:50.089 --> 00:27:56.167
the fundamental badness of
death is that it deprives me of

00:27:56.167 --> 00:27:59.974
life worth having.
But although I've been at pains

00:27:59.974 --> 00:28:02.459
to say this is the
fundamental bad thing

00:28:02.459 --> 00:28:05.104
about death,
I think it's arguable that--I

00:28:05.104 --> 00:28:08.711
think one could make the case
that this isn't the only bad

00:28:08.711 --> 00:28:13.061
thing about death,
even if we're focusing on why

00:28:13.061 --> 00:28:18.305
is death bad for me?
There are other features

00:28:18.305 --> 00:28:23.923
of death, as we experience it,
that are separable from the

00:28:23.923 --> 00:28:28.635
deprivation account,
that at least add to the way

00:28:28.635 --> 00:28:33.351
that death occurs for us,
where we then have to ask the

00:28:33.351 --> 00:28:36.986
question,
does this add to the badness of

00:28:36.986 --> 00:28:39.190
death?
Or conceivably for some of

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.619
these things,
perhaps it mitigates it;

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:44.960
it minimizes it in one way or
another.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.292
So, what I want to do is take
at least a couple of minutes and

00:28:49.292 --> 00:28:52.560
pursue some of these extra
features as well.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.349
Here's an example.
It's not merely the fact--it's

00:28:57.349 --> 00:29:01.240
not merely true that you're
going to die.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.930
It's inevitable that
you're going to die.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.829
There's no avoiding the fact
that you're going to die.

00:29:08.829 --> 00:29:10.941
I mean look,
you're all going to college,

00:29:10.941 --> 00:29:13.579
but it wasn't inevitable that
you go to college.

00:29:13.579 --> 00:29:17.551
Had you chosen not to,
you could've avoided going to

00:29:17.551 --> 00:29:21.413
college.
But it doesn't matter what you

00:29:21.413 --> 00:29:26.462
choose, you can't avoid dying.
So it's not just merely the

00:29:26.462 --> 00:29:29.430
case that in fact we are all
going to die;

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.490
it's a necessary truth
that we're all going to die.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:36.977
So we might ask,
what about this inevitability

00:29:36.977 --> 00:29:41.440
of death?
Does that make things worse?

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.873
And here I want to distinguish
between the individual question

00:29:44.873 --> 00:29:47.688
about the inevitability of
death, and the universal

00:29:47.688 --> 00:29:50.439
question.
So just start by thinking about

00:29:50.439 --> 00:29:54.609
the fact that it's unavoidable
that you're going to die.

00:29:54.609 --> 00:29:59.710
Does the unavoidability of
death make it better or worse?

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:04.303
And the interesting thing is,
I think you can see--you can

00:30:04.303 --> 00:30:07.849
get a feel for both possible
answers here.

00:30:07.849 --> 00:30:10.843
On the one hand,
you can imagine somebody who

00:30:10.843 --> 00:30:14.450
says, "Look, it's bad enough
that I'm going to die,

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:19.664
but the fact that there's
nothing I could do about it just

00:30:19.664 --> 00:30:23.489
makes it worse.
It's like adding insult to

00:30:23.489 --> 00:30:27.680
injury that I'm powerless in the
face of death.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:33.866
I cannot escape the Grim Reaper.
This sheer powerlessness about

00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:38.884
this central fact about the
nature of my existence is an

00:30:38.884 --> 00:30:42.259
extra insult added to the
injury."

00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:44.364
Against that,
however, there are those people

00:30:44.364 --> 00:30:45.559
who'd want to say,
"No.

00:30:45.559 --> 00:30:52.416
Actually, the inevitability of
my death reduces the

00:30:52.416 --> 00:30:55.390
badness."
You all know the expression,

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.660
"Don't cry over spilt milk."
Right?

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.140
That what's done is done.
You can't change it.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:06.131
What you can't change,
loses--when you focus on the

00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:11.922
fact that you can't change it,
it loses some of its grip to

00:31:11.922 --> 00:31:15.017
upset you.
Well, if that's right,

00:31:15.017 --> 00:31:19.416
and if we then realize that
there's nothing I can do about

00:31:19.416 --> 00:31:25.023
the fact that I'm going to die,
then perhaps some of the sting,

00:31:25.023 --> 00:31:28.200
some of the bite,
is eliminated.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:32.701
It's as though you try--try
getting upset about the fact

00:31:32.701 --> 00:31:37.853
that two plus two equals four.
Try feeling upset at your

00:31:37.853 --> 00:31:44.339
powerlessness to change the fact
that two plus two equals four.

00:31:44.339 --> 00:31:47.690
Suppose you wanted two plus two
to equal five.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:54.400
Can you work up anger and
regret and dismay over that?

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.529
Well, most of us,
of course, can't.

00:31:56.529 --> 00:32:04.336
Because when we see that
something is just necessary,

00:32:04.336 --> 00:32:10.831
we--it reduces the sting of it.
The philosopher Spinoza thought

00:32:10.831 --> 00:32:13.914
that if we could only recognize
the fact, what he at least took

00:32:13.914 --> 00:32:17.448
to be the fact,
that everything that happens in

00:32:17.448 --> 00:32:20.937
life is necessary,
then we'd get a kind of

00:32:20.937 --> 00:32:25.539
emotional distance from it;
it would no longer upset us.

00:32:25.539 --> 00:32:28.017
We could no longer be
disappointed,

00:32:28.017 --> 00:32:32.244
because to be disappointed in
something presupposes that it

00:32:32.244 --> 00:32:37.148
could've been some other way.
And Spinoza thought if you see

00:32:37.148 --> 00:32:42.230
that it couldn't go any other
way, then you can't be sad about

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.660
it.
Well, if we see that our death

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.814
is inevitable and we really
internalize that fact,

00:32:47.814 --> 00:32:50.839
perhaps that would reduce the
badness of it.

00:32:50.839 --> 00:32:53.459
Well, maybe that's right,
but going back to the

00:32:53.459 --> 00:32:56.990
firsthand, I don't know how many
of you have read Dostoyevsky's

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.440
short novel The Underground
Man.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.424
The Underground Man is upset
about--if I remember

00:33:02.424 --> 00:33:06.154
correctly--he's upset about the
fact that two plus two equals

00:33:06.154 --> 00:33:09.450
four and there's nothing that he
can do about it.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:14.864
So he curses existence,
curses God at having made him

00:33:14.864 --> 00:33:20.903
so impotent that he can't change
the fact that two plus two

00:33:20.903 --> 00:33:24.096
equals four.
And another philosopher,

00:33:24.096 --> 00:33:27.021
Descartes, in thinking about
God's omnipotence,

00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:30.774
thought that it wouldn't be
good enough if God as omnipotent

00:33:30.774 --> 00:33:33.700
couldn't change the facts of
mathematics.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.553
And so he imagines that God,
as omnipotent,

00:33:36.553 --> 00:33:39.339
could've made two plus two
equals five.

00:33:39.339 --> 00:33:42.619
And so it's a kind of--;So,
it is indeed a fact of our

00:33:42.619 --> 00:33:45.960
powerlessness that we're stuck
with the necessities.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.149
God isn't stuck with them.
And so Dostoyevsky takes that

00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:51.769
thought and runs with it and
says, "Yeah.

00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:54.950
It doesn't help to say that
it's inevitable.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:58.599
It makes it worse."
Well, there's both sides.

00:33:58.599 --> 00:34:01.787
And as I say,
I myself, in different moods,

00:34:01.787 --> 00:34:05.522
get pulled in both ways.
What about the fact that not

00:34:05.522 --> 00:34:08.230
only is it inevitable that I'm
going to die,

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.630
it's inevitable that we're
all going to die.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:18.440
Does the universality of
death make things better or

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.556
worse?
And again, you can sort of feel

00:34:21.556 --> 00:34:24.614
the pull both ways.
On the one hand you say,

00:34:24.614 --> 00:34:28.889
it's bad that I'm going to die,
but I'm not a monster.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:31.900
It makes me feel even
worse that everybody else

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.137
is stuck dying--or perhaps we
should say dying too soon in

00:34:35.137 --> 00:34:37.750
light of our discussion about
immortality.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.622
It's a pity that most
everybody, or perhaps everybody,

00:34:40.622 --> 00:34:43.000
dies too soon.
That makes it even worse.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.982
On the other hand,
you know, let's be honest here,

00:34:45.982 --> 00:34:49.269
we also know the expression,
"Misery loves company."

00:34:49.269 --> 00:34:52.739
And there's at least some
comfort to be had,

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:55.967
isn't there,
in the realization that this

00:34:55.967 --> 00:35:01.683
thing isn't just true for me.
It's not like the universe has

00:35:01.683 --> 00:35:07.179
singled me out for the
deprivation of dying too soon.

00:35:07.179 --> 00:35:10.840
It's something that it does to
everybody.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.909
So perhaps there's some comfort
in the inevitability of death.

00:35:15.909 --> 00:35:19.880
Well, here's a different aspect
of death worth thinking about.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.969
What about the
variability of death?

00:35:23.969 --> 00:35:27.590
After all, it's not just the
case that we all die.

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.550
And I'll stop saying die too
soon.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:31.736
Let's just suppose we
understand that clause to be

00:35:31.736 --> 00:35:35.853
implied in what I'm saying.
It's not just the case that we

00:35:35.853 --> 00:35:38.950
all die.
There's a great deal of

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:43.059
variation in how much
life we get.

00:35:43.059 --> 00:35:47.800
Some of us make it to the ripe
old age of 80,90 a 100 or more.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.729
Others of us die at 20,
or 15, or 10,

00:35:52.729 --> 00:35:56.938
or younger.
Even if death were inevitable,

00:35:56.938 --> 00:36:01.309
it wouldn't have to come in
different-sized packages.

00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:03.519
That is, it wouldn't have to
have variability.

00:36:03.519 --> 00:36:08.303
We could imagine a world in
which everybody dies--everybody

00:36:08.303 --> 00:36:14.257
dies at the age of a hundred.
Does it make things worse or

00:36:14.257 --> 00:36:19.840
better that there's this kind of
variability?

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.889
From the moral point of view,
I suppose, it's fairly

00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:25.940
straightforward to suggest it
makes things worse.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.937
After all, most of us are
inclined to think that

00:36:29.937 --> 00:36:33.170
inequality is morally
objectionable.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.680
It's bad that,
through no fault of their own,

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.590
some people are poor and other
people are rich.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:43.974
If inequality is morally
objectionable,

00:36:43.974 --> 00:36:48.785
then it's very likely we're
going to think it's morally

00:36:48.785 --> 00:36:52.971
horrendous that there's this
crucial inequality:

00:36:52.971 --> 00:36:58.940
some of us die a the age of 5
while others get to live to 90.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:03.511
But in keeping with the focus
of our discussion about the

00:37:03.511 --> 00:37:07.267
badness of death,
I want to put aside the moral

00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:12.084
question and think about how
good or bad for me is it

00:37:12.084 --> 00:37:15.349
that there's variability in
death?

00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:19.168
Well, we might say,
let's look at it from two basic

00:37:19.168 --> 00:37:22.223
perspectives,
those who get less than the

00:37:22.223 --> 00:37:26.424
average lifespan and those who
get more than the average

00:37:26.424 --> 00:37:28.825
lifespan.
From the point of view of

00:37:28.825 --> 00:37:31.940
somebody who gets less,
this is obviously a bad thing.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:35.409
It's bad enough that I'm going
to die too soon.

00:37:35.409 --> 00:37:36.903
I said I wasn't going to keep
saying that remark,

00:37:36.903 --> 00:37:39.982
and here I am saying it anyway.
It's bad enough that I'm going

00:37:39.982 --> 00:37:42.966
to die.
But what's even worse is I'm

00:37:42.966 --> 00:37:47.840
going to get even less than the
average amount of life.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.633
That's clearly an extra-bad.
But we might then wonder,

00:37:51.633 --> 00:37:55.673
for every person who gets less
than the average amount of

00:37:55.673 --> 00:37:58.269
life--suppose we take the
median,

00:37:58.269 --> 00:38:00.623
take the amount of life that's
exactly, 50 percent of the

00:38:00.623 --> 00:38:02.471
people get more,
50 percent of the people get

00:38:02.471 --> 00:38:04.630
less.
For every person who has less

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:08.375
than the median amount of life,
there's another person who has

00:38:08.375 --> 00:38:11.200
more than the median
amount of life.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.410
That person gets to say, hey.
Well, you know,

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.959
it's a pity that I'm going to
die or die too soon,

00:38:15.959 --> 00:38:18.560
but at least I'm getting more
than the average.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:23.633
That's a plus.
So perhaps these two aspects

00:38:23.633 --> 00:38:26.958
balance themselves out.
There are people who are

00:38:26.958 --> 00:38:29.849
basically screwed by the fact
that they get less than the

00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:32.843
average amount and people who
are benefited by getting more

00:38:32.843 --> 00:38:35.971
than the average amount.
So perhaps in terms of the

00:38:35.971 --> 00:38:38.670
individual badness of death
that's a wash.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:42.490
Maybe.
Except it seems to me it's a

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:46.355
further fact about human
psychology that we care more

00:38:46.355 --> 00:38:50.219
about being short-changed than
we do about being,

00:38:50.219 --> 00:38:54.309
as we might put it,
overcompensated.

00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:59.712
I rather suspect that people
who have less than the average

00:38:59.712 --> 00:39:03.345
of something,
it hurts them more than it

00:39:03.345 --> 00:39:08.189
benefits the people who have
more than the average of

00:39:08.189 --> 00:39:12.066
something.
And if that's right--and that

00:39:12.066 --> 00:39:16.758
seems likely to be the case,
especially for something like

00:39:16.758 --> 00:39:21.943
death--the extra bad of the fact
that there's variability and so

00:39:21.943 --> 00:39:26.469
some people get less than
average--that extra bad,

00:39:26.469 --> 00:39:32.452
I suspect, outweighs the extra
benefit of some people having

00:39:32.452 --> 00:39:35.960
more than average.
Well, let's consider a

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.870
different feature.
We've had inevitability;

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:42.961
we had variability.
What about

00:39:42.961 --> 00:39:47.822
unpredictability?
Not only is it inevitable that

00:39:47.822 --> 00:39:51.676
you're going to die;
not only do some people live

00:39:51.676 --> 00:39:56.521
longer than others,
you don't know how much more

00:39:56.521 --> 00:39:59.120
time you've got.
Now, you might think,

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.949
well, didn't we already discuss
that when we started thinking

00:40:00.949 --> 00:40:02.355
about variability?
But in fact,

00:40:02.355 --> 00:40:04.906
logically speaking at least,
variability,

00:40:04.906 --> 00:40:07.968
although it's a requirement for
unpredictability,

00:40:07.968 --> 00:40:10.519
doesn't guarantee
unpredictability.

00:40:10.519 --> 00:40:15.889
You could have variability with
complete predictability.

00:40:15.889 --> 00:40:20.970
Imagine that when everybody's
born, on their wrist everybody's

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:26.300
born with a natural birthmark
that indicates the precise year,

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:31.590
day, and time in which they're
going to die.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:35.780
We could imagine a world like
this where it's inevitable;

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.810
everybody's got some date on it.
And for that matter,

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.750
there could still be
variability.

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.610
Some people live 80 years,
some people live 20 years.

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:50.620
But there's no unpredictability.
Because of the birthmark,

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.990
everybody knows exactly how
much longer they've got.

00:40:59.159 --> 00:41:01.690
Well, so in our world we don't
have that.

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:03.986
In our world,
not only do we have

00:41:03.986 --> 00:41:07.000
variability, we've got
unpredictability.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.559
Does that make things better?
Or does that make things worse?

00:41:11.559 --> 00:41:16.909
Would it be better to know when
you were going to die?

00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:22.181
Well, one way in which
unpredictability at least has

00:41:22.181 --> 00:41:27.039
the potential of making things
worse is this.

00:41:27.039 --> 00:41:31.742
Because you don't know how much
more time you've got--You can

00:41:31.742 --> 00:41:35.425
make a guess based on
statistics, but as we saw,

00:41:35.425 --> 00:41:38.850
there's wild unpredictability.
You can think,

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:42.220
look, "the average lifespan in
the United States is whatever it

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.130
is, 82 years.
So I probably have,

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:47.195
you guys are in your 20s--you
know 20--roughly another 60

00:41:47.195 --> 00:41:49.482
years are going."
And as you're busy calculating

00:41:49.482 --> 00:41:51.985
all this, you're walking across
Chapel Street and you get hit by

00:41:51.985 --> 00:41:53.989
a truck and you die.
Right?

00:41:53.989 --> 00:41:58.329
Because of unpredictability,
you can't really know.

00:41:58.329 --> 00:42:04.431
And because you can't really
know, it's difficult to make the

00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:08.908
right kinds of plans.
And in particular,

00:42:08.908 --> 00:42:13.659
it's hard to know how to pace
yourself.

00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:20.920
You decide to go off to medical
school, become a doctor.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.281
And so not only do you put the
time into college,

00:42:23.281 --> 00:42:25.199
you put the time into medical
school,

00:42:25.199 --> 00:42:28.620
and you put the time into your
residency and you put your time

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.375
into your internship.
And that's a very long

00:42:32.375 --> 00:42:36.218
commitment.
It's a long-term plan,

00:42:36.218 --> 00:42:43.260
which can go wrong if you get
sick and die in your early 20s.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.658
Well, that's a rather dramatic
example, but the same sort of

00:42:46.658 --> 00:42:49.250
thing in principle can happen to
all of us.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:53.537
You make a life plan,
what you want to accomplish in

00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:56.900
your life, and well,
obviously enough,

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.824
some of us will die too soon,
not just in terms of,

00:42:59.824 --> 00:43:02.750
"oh, well, life still could've
had good things,"

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:06.484
but too soon in terms of you
didn't get where you wanted to

00:43:06.484 --> 00:43:10.376
get in terms of your life plan.
If only you'd known you were

00:43:10.376 --> 00:43:13.971
only going to have 20 more years
instead of 50 more years,

00:43:13.971 --> 00:43:17.820
you would've picked a different
kind of life for yourself.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:22.030
The unpredictability makes it
worse.

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.948
And indeed, less obviously,
it can work the other way as

00:43:24.948 --> 00:43:27.307
well.
You make a life plan,

00:43:27.307 --> 00:43:31.000
and then, you know,
you don't die yet.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.451
You continue to stick around,
and then your life has this

00:43:35.451 --> 00:43:39.903
feeling of--at least we can
imagine this happening--being

00:43:39.903 --> 00:43:44.610
sort of anticlimactic.
You peaked too soon.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:46.986
If only you'd known you had
another 50 years,

00:43:46.986 --> 00:43:49.849
that you weren't going to die
young--or James Dean,

00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:53.347
going to burn out fast and die
young--if only you'd realized

00:43:53.347 --> 00:43:56.369
you were going to live to the
ripe old age of 97,

00:43:56.369 --> 00:43:59.829
you would have picked a
different life for yourself.

00:43:59.829 --> 00:44:04.718
Now, in thinking about these
points, in effect I'm suggesting

00:44:04.718 --> 00:44:07.570
that the value of your life--so
,

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:09.447
we previously were talking
about different theories of

00:44:09.447 --> 00:44:11.360
well-being and what makes for
the best kind of life.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.290
Here we have yet another kind
of feature that we haven't

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:17.591
talked about.
We might think of it as,

00:44:17.591 --> 00:44:21.760
the overall shape of your life
matters.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:28.182
What we could also call "the
narrative arc of your life"

00:44:28.182 --> 00:44:31.582
matters.
Let me illustrate the point

00:44:31.582 --> 00:44:34.559
with some very,
very simple graphs.

00:44:34.559 --> 00:44:37.585
These are not meant to be
realistic, but they'll give you

00:44:37.585 --> 00:44:40.480
the idea.
So, we all know the Horatio

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.889
Alger story right?
Somebody starts out poor and

00:44:44.889 --> 00:44:50.768
makes his way through hard work
and dedication and effort to

00:44:50.768 --> 00:44:54.823
riches and success.
Rags to riches--that's a

00:44:54.823 --> 00:44:59.637
wonderful, inspiring life.
Let's draw the graph of that

00:44:59.637 --> 00:45:02.794
life.
So here's how well off you are,

00:45:02.794 --> 00:45:06.366
here is time,
and you start with nothing and

00:45:06.366 --> 00:45:11.050
you end up incredibly well off.
That's a great life.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:14.850
That's the Horatio Alger
life--H.A.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:18.320
Great life.
All right.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.440
Now, consider the following
story.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:27.056
Here are the axes again.
Instead of the rags to riches

00:45:27.056 --> 00:45:31.179
life, imagine the riches to rags
life.

00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:35.090
Starts off with everything,
ends up with nothing.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:42.380
That's the Algers Horatio story.
It's the reverse.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:48.187
Now, I doubt if there's anybody
here who is indifferent between

00:45:48.187 --> 00:45:53.526
the choices, indifferent with
regard to the choice between

00:45:53.526 --> 00:45:58.777
these two lives.
I imagine that everybody here

00:45:58.777 --> 00:46:02.989
prefers this life.
But notice that in terms of the

00:46:02.989 --> 00:46:06.150
contents of the life,
at least the local contents,

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:09.310
it's a bit hard to see why that
would be the case,

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:11.896
right?
We've got equal periods of

00:46:11.896 --> 00:46:16.082
suffering and doing slightly
better and slightly better and

00:46:16.082 --> 00:46:20.340
slightly better--equal periods
of success and suffering.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.436
For every bad period here
there's a corresponding bad

00:46:23.436 --> 00:46:25.726
period here.
For every good period here

00:46:25.726 --> 00:46:28.079
there's a corresponding good
period here.

00:46:28.079 --> 00:46:31.219
In terms of the contents of
your life, being crude but you

00:46:31.219 --> 00:46:33.477
see the point,
in terms of the contents of

00:46:33.477 --> 00:46:36.540
your life--equally good.
And even if we accept the

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.974
valuable container theory,
and so we say,

00:46:38.974 --> 00:46:41.529
"Hah, you know,
being alive per se is worth

00:46:41.529 --> 00:46:44.813
something as well."
Well, you're alive for equal

00:46:44.813 --> 00:46:48.975
periods of time.
So the extra points get added

00:46:48.975 --> 00:46:51.565
either way.
You might say,

00:46:51.565 --> 00:46:56.676
look, if we're not indifferent
between these two lives,

00:46:56.676 --> 00:47:01.692
that's because we think the
overall shape of your life

00:47:01.692 --> 00:47:06.489
matters as well.
The narrative arc, as I put it.

00:47:06.489 --> 00:47:11.309
The story "bad to good" is the
kind of story we want for

00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:16.829
ourselves, while the story "good
to bad" is the kind of story we

00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:21.250
don't want for ourselves.
Interesting question.

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:25.706
Why is that?
And this of course should

00:47:25.706 --> 00:47:28.670
remind us of the puzzle about
Lucretius.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:32.992
Why do we care more about
future non-existence than past

00:47:32.992 --> 00:47:36.240
non-existence?
When the bad is behind us,

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:41.139
that seems less bothersome than
when the bad is in front of us.

00:47:41.139 --> 00:47:45.047
You may remember the story from
Derek Parfit about having the

00:47:45.047 --> 00:47:47.758
painful operation.
Was it going to be in the

00:47:47.758 --> 00:47:50.180
future or did it take place
earlier today?

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:52.340
You don't remember.
We're not indifferent.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:57.559
We want the bad behind us,
not the bad in front of us.

00:47:57.559 --> 00:48:03.755
So, whatever the explanation
is, we care about the overall

00:48:03.755 --> 00:48:07.559
shape and trajectory of our
life.

00:48:07.559 --> 00:48:11.669
Now, that being the case,
we have to worry then that

00:48:11.669 --> 00:48:16.665
because of the unpredictability
of death that our lives may not

00:48:16.665 --> 00:48:18.680
have the ideal shape.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:26.950
A lot of us might feel that a
life like this,

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:32.630
where we peak but then we stick
around--you know,

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:37.310
isn't--can at least fail to be
as desirable in which we end

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.689
with a bang.
If you start thinking about

00:48:39.689 --> 00:48:41.539
narrative arcs--imagine a novel,
right?

00:48:41.539 --> 00:48:45.997
It's one thing to have--it's
not to say that the best--if you

00:48:45.997 --> 00:48:50.010
want your life to be like the
plot of a great story,

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:53.911
it's not as though you think,
"All right, the dénouement

00:48:53.911 --> 00:48:56.420
must occur at the very last
page."

00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:01.720
It's okay to stick around for a
while, but if the high point of

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:06.678
the story occurs in chapter 2
and then there are another 67

00:49:06.678 --> 00:49:10.617
chapters after that,
you think, this was not a

00:49:10.617 --> 00:49:14.911
well-constructed novel.
And insofar as we care about

00:49:14.911 --> 00:49:20.407
the overall shape of our lives,
we might worry about wanting it

00:49:20.407 --> 00:49:25.790
to have the right shape overall.
Where and when do you want to

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:28.385
peak, as it were,
in terms of your

00:49:28.385 --> 00:49:31.974
accomplishments?
Well, that matters to us,

00:49:31.974 --> 00:49:35.744
but the trouble is,
without predictability you

00:49:35.744 --> 00:49:38.760
don't know where to put the
peak.

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.102
Because if you try to aim for
peaking later,

00:49:42.102 --> 00:49:46.493
you might not make it to that.
If you put it too soon,

00:49:46.493 --> 00:49:50.052
you might stick around for
longer than that,

00:49:50.052 --> 00:49:53.280
and then the peak has come too
soon.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:58.718
All of this suggests then that
the unpredictability of our

00:49:58.718 --> 00:50:02.440
death adds an extra negative
element.

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:07.901
It makes it harder to plan what
the best way to live my life

00:50:07.901 --> 00:50:11.242
would be.
And from that perspective it

00:50:11.242 --> 00:50:15.804
looks as though it would be
better to know how much time

00:50:15.804 --> 00:50:18.966
you've got left.
But then we have to ask--so

00:50:18.966 --> 00:50:22.079
I'll throw the question out and
we'll call it a day,

00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:25.659
start with this next time--then
we have to ask,

00:50:25.659 --> 00:50:28.460
would it really be better to
know?

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:33.288
Would you want the birthmark?
Would you want to know exactly

00:50:33.288 --> 00:50:37.060
how much time you've got left?
All Right.

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:38.326
See you next time.

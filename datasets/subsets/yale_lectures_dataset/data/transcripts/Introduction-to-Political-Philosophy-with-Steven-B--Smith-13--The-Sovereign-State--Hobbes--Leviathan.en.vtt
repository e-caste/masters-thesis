00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.240
Professor Steven Smith:
Where else are we?

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.849
Today we're going to continue
the state of nature,

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.144
Hobbes' most famous discovery,
his most famous metaphor,

00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:18.350
his most famous concept.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.231
At the end of class last time,
I tried to identify Hobbes'

00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:29.680
central problem,
is the problem of authority,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.175
what makes authority possible,
what makes authority

00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:36.740
legitimate, and in order to
answer that question,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.232
I suggested,
he created this idea,

00:00:40.232 --> 00:00:44.890
this metaphor again,
of a state of nature,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.950
a state in which he says we are
naturally in.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.747
Hobbes' state of nature is
virtually the opposite of

00:00:52.747 --> 00:00:56.842
Aristotle's conception of the
natural end or the natural

00:00:56.842 --> 00:01:00.727
telos of man.
It does not consist of our

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:05.002
perfection, a condition of our
perfection as Aristotle

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:08.293
believed,
but for Hobbes the state of

00:01:08.293 --> 00:01:13.284
nature is something like the
condition of human life in the

00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:18.498
absence of authority,
in the absence of anyone to

00:01:18.498 --> 00:01:22.230
impose rules,
order, law on us.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.640
What would human beings be like
in such a condition,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.088
a condition of the type that he
imagined maintains in periods of

00:01:32.088 --> 00:01:36.035
crisis,
civil war of the kind that was

00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:41.754
true of England in the 1640s?
And I suggested at the end of

00:01:41.754 --> 00:01:46.921
last time that in many ways
Hobbes' idea of the state of

00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:52.276
nature can be understood in a
sense as an extension of his

00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:57.912
scientific methodology set out
in the opening chapters of the

00:01:57.912 --> 00:01:59.982
book.
Let's imagine,

00:01:59.982 --> 00:02:03.483
as he says, human beings as if
they were in a sort of

00:02:03.483 --> 00:02:07.958
laboratory test tube.
Let's strip human beings of all

00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:12.199
their social ties and customs
and traditions.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:17.022
Let's see what they would be
like in abstraction from all of

00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:21.436
the social and political
relationships which they enjoy

00:02:21.436 --> 00:02:26.094
and see how they would interact
with one another almost as

00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:30.878
chemical properties.
And you can see Hobbes working

00:02:30.878 --> 00:02:36.195
along that line but I would say
this as it were scientific or

00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:41.511
proto-scientific conception of
the state of nature is not the

00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:46.119
whole answer to this story
because underlying Hobbes'

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.727
conception of the state of
nature is a powerful moral

00:02:50.727 --> 00:02:54.188
conception,
a moral idea of the human

00:02:54.188 --> 00:02:58.509
being, and that's what I want to
talk a little bit about today.

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:02.639
Hobbes is a moralist,
which seems odd in some ways.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.878
How could grim and dour old
Thomas Hobbes be regarded as a

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:15.663
moralist or someone with a moral
conception of human nature and

00:03:15.663 --> 00:03:20.204
the human condition?
But that's what I want to

00:03:20.204 --> 00:03:24.887
suggest to you today.
The term, in a sense in which

00:03:24.887 --> 00:03:30.882
we might better characterize his
conception of the state of

00:03:30.882 --> 00:03:37.303
nature, is one of individuality.
Hobbes shows us what it is to

00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:41.169
exercise the qualities of moral
agency;

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.690
that is, to say to do for
ourselves rather than to have

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.603
things done for us or for you.
Hobbes introduced into our

00:03:51.603 --> 00:03:56.949
moral language the idiom of
individuality.

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.726
And this concept,
the concept of what it is to be

00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:01.520
an individual,
a moral agent,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.025
isn't really--is really not
older than or at least not much

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:08.900
older than the seventeenth
century.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.664
Until the Renaissance or not
much later, people considered

00:04:13.664 --> 00:04:18.430
themselves primarily not as
individuals but as members,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.866
members of a particular family,
of a caste, of a guild,

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:25.660
of a particular religious
order,

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.489
of a city or so on.
The idea that one is first of

00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:36.788
all a self with an "I," an ego,
would have been regarded as

00:04:36.788 --> 00:04:42.543
unintelligible and even as late
as the nineteenth century Alexis

00:04:42.543 --> 00:04:47.660
de Tocqueville in Democracy
in America says,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.011
"individualism is a recent
expression arising from a new

00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:55.251
idea."
That idea appeared new to

00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:58.642
Tocqueville as late as the
nineteenth century and this idea

00:04:58.642 --> 00:05:01.318
of the individual,
I want to suggest,

00:05:01.318 --> 00:05:06.145
is at least in part and maybe
in large part traceable back to

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:06.950
Hobbes.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:18.960
What is Hobbes' individual?
Hobbes conceived us through a

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:27.376
process of abstraction from the
web of attachments in which we

00:05:27.376 --> 00:05:30.983
find ourselves.
We are beings,

00:05:30.983 --> 00:05:35.556
he argues again in the opening
chapters, whose fundamental

00:05:35.556 --> 00:05:40.370
characteristics as human beings
are willing and choosing.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.870
We are beings for whom the
exercise of the will is a

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.076
preeminent feature and much of
our happiness as human beings

00:05:50.076 --> 00:05:54.753
depends upon our capacity to
exercise our will and our

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:59.454
ability for choice.
Life for Hobbes is an exercise

00:05:59.454 --> 00:06:03.944
in continual willing and
continual choosing that may be

00:06:03.944 --> 00:06:09.182
temporarily interrupted but can
never come to an end except with

00:06:09.182 --> 00:06:13.807
the end of life itself.
Hobbes' individuality or

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:19.071
individualism is closely
connected to this conception of

00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:23.857
a human being or human
well-being as success in the

00:06:23.857 --> 00:06:27.589
competition for the goods of
life.

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:31.029
"Continual success," he writes
in chapter 6,

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:35.829
"continual success in obtaining
those things which a man from

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:41.110
time to time desireth is what is
called happiness or felicity.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:47.724
Our well being depends on our
ability to achieve the objects

00:06:47.724 --> 00:06:51.491
of our desires,
the objects of our choices,

00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:55.284
for there is no such thing," he
continues, "as perpetual

00:06:55.284 --> 00:06:58.913
tranquility of mind,
no such thing as perpetual

00:06:58.913 --> 00:07:03.472
tranquility, while we live here,
because life itself is but

00:07:03.472 --> 00:07:08.345
motion and can never be without
desire nor without fear no more

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:12.752
than without sense."
These are the characteristics

00:07:12.752 --> 00:07:15.867
of human life,
sense, fear and desire,

00:07:15.867 --> 00:07:19.910
continual desire for one thing
after another,

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.115
and for Hobbes this fact is not
simply a physical or factual

00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:30.055
description of human behavior
but it is a moral condition

00:07:30.055 --> 00:07:34.290
because we are each of us
bundles of activity and

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.802
initiative,
of likes and dislikes,

00:07:37.802 --> 00:07:42.615
of desires and aversions.
Life for Hobbes is competition

00:07:42.615 --> 00:07:47.648
or struggle not just over scarce
resources, although that might

00:07:47.648 --> 00:07:51.076
be part of the struggle,
but for honors,

00:07:51.076 --> 00:07:55.610
for anything else that a person
might value or esteem.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.885
Hobbes is fascinated and,
is again like Montaigne and a

00:07:59.885 --> 00:08:03.211
number of others,
he is fascinated with the

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:05.912
diversity,
the sheer diversity,

00:08:05.912 --> 00:08:10.273
multiplicity of human desires.
What leads one person to

00:08:10.273 --> 00:08:15.085
laughter, leads another person
to tears, what leads one person

00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:18.631
to piety and prayer,
leads another person to

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:22.075
ridicule and so on and so on.
Even moral terms,

00:08:22.075 --> 00:08:24.935
Hobbes says,
terms like "good" and "evil,"

00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:29.399
he says are expressions of our
individual likes and dislikes.

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:33.313
We like something,
he says, not because it is good

00:08:33.313 --> 00:08:37.866
but we call something good
because we like it and the same

00:08:37.866 --> 00:08:41.539
with other moral qualities and
attributes.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:46.419
They are expressions for him of
our psychological states and

00:08:46.419 --> 00:08:51.216
aspirations and it is this
individualism that is the ground

00:08:51.216 --> 00:08:55.848
of the general competition that
we all experience for the

00:08:55.848 --> 00:09:00.975
objects of our desires that he
says the--or from this he infers

00:09:00.975 --> 00:09:05.690
that the natural condition is
one of competition,

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.110
of struggle,
of enmity and of war.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.394
In a famous passage from
chapter 11 he posits,

00:09:12.394 --> 00:09:15.533
as he puts it,
"a general inclination of all

00:09:15.533 --> 00:09:19.582
mankind,
a perpetual and restless desire

00:09:19.582 --> 00:09:24.700
of power after power that
ceaseth only in death."

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.502
This is, as he puts it,
"a general inclination of all

00:09:28.502 --> 00:09:32.158
mankind," this constant
restlessness and motion and

00:09:32.158 --> 00:09:36.472
expression of our individuality
and what I have been calling

00:09:36.472 --> 00:09:39.470
Hobbes' individualism is
connected,

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:45.173
in fact even is underwritten by
another attribute that is

00:09:45.173 --> 00:09:48.710
central to Hobbes.
It is his skepticism.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.234
Like many of the great early
modern philosophers,

00:09:53.234 --> 00:09:56.250
Montaigne, Descartes,
Spinoza,

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.754
Hobbes was obsessed with the
question about what can I know

00:10:00.754 --> 00:10:05.060
or, maybe put a different way,
what am I entitled to believe,

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.823
and there are many passages in
Leviathan that testify to

00:10:08.823 --> 00:10:12.040
Hobbes' fundamentally skeptical
view of knowledge.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.033
Right?
He is a skeptic not because he

00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:21.190
believes that we can have no
foundations for our beliefs

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:27.379
whatever but he is a skeptic in
the sense that there can be no,

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:30.729
on his view,
transcendent or nonhuman

00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:35.049
foundations for our beliefs.
We cannot be certain,

00:10:35.049 --> 00:10:39.272
he thinks, of the ultimate
foundations of our knowledge and

00:10:39.272 --> 00:10:42.501
this explains,
you may have wondered about

00:10:42.501 --> 00:10:46.558
this, this explains the
importance he attributes to such

00:10:46.558 --> 00:10:51.279
things as naming and attaching
correct definitions to things.

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:54.313
For reason, he writes in a
famous passage,

00:10:54.313 --> 00:10:57.200
"for reason is nothing but
reckoning,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.730
that is adding and subtracting
the consequences of general

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.312
names agreed upon."
Knowledge, in other words,

00:11:05.312 --> 00:11:08.990
is for Hobbes a human
construction and it is always

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:13.551
subject to what human beings can
be made to agree upon and that

00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:17.964
skeptical view of knowledge or
at least skeptical view of the

00:11:17.964 --> 00:11:23.039
foundation of knowledge has far
reaching consequences for him.

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:25.789
If all knowledge,
according to Hobbes,

00:11:25.789 --> 00:11:29.580
ultimately rests on agreement
about shared terms,

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.616
he infers from that that our
reason, our rationality,

00:11:33.616 --> 00:11:38.274
has no share in what Plato or
Aristotle would have called the

00:11:38.274 --> 00:11:42.500
divine Noos,
the divine intelligence.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:47.789
Our reason has within it no
spark of divinity.

00:11:47.789 --> 00:11:52.276
Our reason does not testify to
some kind of inner voice of

00:11:52.276 --> 00:11:56.684
conscience or anything that
would purport to give it some

00:11:56.684 --> 00:12:02.214
kind of indubitable foundation.
Such certainty as we have about

00:12:02.214 --> 00:12:07.495
anything is for Hobbes always
provisional, discovered on the

00:12:07.495 --> 00:12:12.776
basis of experience and subject
to continual revision in the

00:12:12.776 --> 00:12:18.076
light of further experience,
and that again experiential

00:12:18.076 --> 00:12:22.033
conception of knowledge.
That kind of skepticism about

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:25.968
the foundations of knowledge has
further implications for Hobbes'

00:12:25.968 --> 00:12:29.720
views on such things as religion
and religious toleration.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.617
"There are no signs or fruit of
religion," he says,

00:12:34.617 --> 00:12:38.830
"but in man only," he says in
chapter 12.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:42.058
That is to say,
the causes of religion can be

00:12:42.058 --> 00:12:46.315
traced back and are rooted in
the restlessness of the human

00:12:46.315 --> 00:12:49.893
mind in its search for causes.
And it is because,

00:12:49.893 --> 00:12:53.385
he says, we are born ignorant
of causes, we are ignorant of

00:12:53.385 --> 00:12:56.828
the causes of things,
that we are led to search out

00:12:56.828 --> 00:13:00.480
beginnings and origins and this
leads us ultimately,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.580
he says, to posit the existence
of God who is,

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.679
so to speak,
the first cause of all things.

00:13:08.679 --> 00:13:11.443
Hobbes does not,
despite this kind of

00:13:11.443 --> 00:13:16.050
rationalistic view of religion
and his view that religion has

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:20.580
its origin again in the
restlessness of the human mind,

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.527
Hobbes doesn't deny the
possibility of revelation or

00:13:24.527 --> 00:13:28.320
some kind of direct
communication of God to us.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.975
But what he does deny is that
anyone who has claimed to

00:13:32.975 --> 00:13:37.823
receive such a revelation,
he denies that any such person

00:13:37.823 --> 00:13:42.284
has the right to impose that
view on anyone else because

00:13:42.284 --> 00:13:47.152
nobody else can correctly have
the means to verify a person's

00:13:47.152 --> 00:13:51.596
claim to revelation.
No one can impose their claim

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:54.429
of revealed knowledge on
another.

00:13:54.429 --> 00:13:57.394
Does this make Hobbes an
atheist, as many would have

00:13:57.394 --> 00:13:59.799
maintained in his day?
No.

00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:06.890
It makes him a skeptic about
revealed religion.

00:14:11.549 --> 00:14:15.823
So it is because of this
individualism and skepticism,

00:14:15.823 --> 00:14:19.129
a view of life as willing and
choosing,

00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:22.972
that there are in the state of
nature so to speak no standards

00:14:22.972 --> 00:14:26.844
to adjudicate conflicts,
that the central issue of

00:14:26.844 --> 00:14:30.687
politics arises,
namely what makes authority

00:14:30.687 --> 00:14:33.736
possible,
how are people who are

00:14:33.736 --> 00:14:38.228
biologically individually
constituted, so to speak,

00:14:38.228 --> 00:14:43.709
how can any of them ever--any
of us ever be capable of obeying

00:14:43.709 --> 00:14:49.190
common rules or having moral
obligations to one another?

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:54.185
How is that possible,
Hobbes continues to ask in a

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:59.690
manner of speaking on almost
every page of the book.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.663
But before answering that
question, consider a little

00:15:03.663 --> 00:15:08.248
further Hobbes' account of the
state of nature and what makes

00:15:08.248 --> 00:15:12.222
it seem like a plausible
starting point to answer the

00:15:12.222 --> 00:15:15.890
question of what makes authority
possible.

00:15:19.409 --> 00:15:23.558
To say that the state of nature
consists primarily of

00:15:23.558 --> 00:15:26.669
individuals with again diverse
likes,

00:15:26.669 --> 00:15:30.354
dislikes, beliefs,
opinions and the like is not to

00:15:30.354 --> 00:15:34.490
say that the state of nature is
a state of isolation,

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.090
as it sometimes attributed to
him.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.966
People in the state of nature
may have regular and continual

00:15:40.966 --> 00:15:45.058
contact with one another.
It is just that their relations

00:15:45.058 --> 00:15:48.419
are unregulated.
They are unregulated by law;

00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:51.129
they are unregulated by
authority.

00:15:51.129 --> 00:15:57.889
The state of nature is simply a
kind of condition of maximum

00:15:57.889 --> 00:16:04.190
insecurity, an unregulated
market with no common laws or

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:09.434
rules to sustain it.
The emphasis on the individual

00:16:09.434 --> 00:16:13.840
is just another way of saying,
again unlike Aristotle,

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.330
that no one has natural
authority over anyone else.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.917
Relations of authority exist
only by, so to speak,

00:16:22.917 --> 00:16:26.850
the consent or the will of the
governed.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:31.985
And the fact that relations in
the state of nature are

00:16:31.985 --> 00:16:37.410
unregulated for him makes
it--it's synonymous with making

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.808
it a condition of war,
of "all against all," in his

00:16:41.808 --> 00:16:44.938
famous formulation.
Now, you might look at that

00:16:44.938 --> 00:16:49.110
formulation, the state of war is
one against--of all against all

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.820
and you might say that such a
condition of civil war,

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.576
of maximum insecurity,
of the total breakdown of

00:16:56.576 --> 00:17:01.211
condition of rules and laws is
if anything the state of the

00:17:01.211 --> 00:17:04.865
exception.
How often does that really

00:17:04.865 --> 00:17:08.670
occur in our experience in human
life?

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:13.554
But Hobbes, like Machiavelli,
as we saw, likes to take the

00:17:13.554 --> 00:17:17.839
exceptional situation and turn
it into the norm.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:21.617
It becomes the normal
condition, state of security,

00:17:21.617 --> 00:17:24.789
insecurity, fear,
conflict and the like.

00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:27.719
This is not to say,
again, that the state of nature

00:17:27.719 --> 00:17:30.180
for Hobbes is one of permanent
fighting.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.963
But it is one of permanent fear
and distrust and he asks his

00:17:33.963 --> 00:17:37.940
readers…there are so many
wonderful passages in this book,

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.536
this just happens to be one of
my particular favorites,

00:17:41.536 --> 00:17:44.599
he asks his readers if you
don't believe me,

00:17:44.599 --> 00:17:48.040
again think of his skepticism,
don't believe me,

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.847
he says, check your own
experience and see if I'm not

00:17:51.847 --> 00:17:54.910
right.
And this is what he writes.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:58.453
"Let him, the reader,
therefore ask himself," Hobbes

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:02.691
writes, "when taking a journey
he arms himself and seeks to go

00:18:02.691 --> 00:18:05.668
well accompanied.
When going to sleep,

00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:10.375
he locks his doors even when in
his house, and even when in his

00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:13.259
house he locks his chests and
this,

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.667
when he knows,
he says, there be laws and

00:18:15.667 --> 00:18:19.278
public officers armed to avenge
all injuries shall be done to

00:18:19.278 --> 00:18:20.779
him.
What opinion,

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:23.995
Hobbes asks,
he has of his fellow subjects

00:18:23.995 --> 00:18:27.941
when he rides armed?
What does that say about your

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:32.223
thinking about your fellow
citizens when you arm yourselves

00:18:32.223 --> 00:18:35.635
going for a trip,
of his fellow citizens when he

00:18:35.635 --> 00:18:39.506
locks his doors at night or of
his children and servants when

00:18:39.506 --> 00:18:43.335
he locks his chests?
Does he not therefore as much

00:18:43.335 --> 00:18:47.460
accuse mankind by his action as
I do by my words?"

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.632
You can see the mischievousness
of Hobbes in that delightful

00:18:51.632 --> 00:18:53.295
passage.
What about you,

00:18:53.295 --> 00:18:56.990
he says, and this is not in
some kind of state of nature.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:02.083
This is in a completely fully
functioning society when you go

00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:08.369
armed, when you lock your doors,
when you lock your chests at

00:19:08.369 --> 00:19:15.533
night, don't your actions and
your experience simply confirm

00:19:15.533 --> 00:19:19.415
what I'm saying?
And this tells us another thing

00:19:19.415 --> 00:19:22.160
about the state of nature which
it is easy to forget.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.657
The state of nature,
at least for Hobbes,

00:19:25.657 --> 00:19:30.729
is not some kind of primitive
anthropological datum that we

00:19:30.729 --> 00:19:34.140
find by going back in time
somehow.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.869
Rousseau will speak about it
more this way.

00:19:36.869 --> 00:19:40.741
For Hobbes, the state of nature
exists, he says,

00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:43.789
whenever authority is not
enforced.

00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:47.492
The state of nature fully
continues, in many ways,

00:19:47.492 --> 00:19:51.559
oddly even in civil society,
he says, whenever we have

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:56.023
reason to believe that our lives
or our properties or ourselves

00:19:56.023 --> 00:19:57.320
are not secure.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:09.727
In fact, we can never be fully
free of the fear and of the

00:20:09.727 --> 00:20:16.000
anxiety and uncertainty of the
state of nature,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:24.039
even within to some degree of
fully constituted civil society.

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:27.824
The only exception to this of
course in Hobbes' account of the

00:20:27.824 --> 00:20:31.360
state of nature when he says
"don't you lock your doors at

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.771
night" are of course Yale
students living here on campus

00:20:34.771 --> 00:20:38.494
who are so trusting that they
never lock their doors at night

00:20:38.494 --> 00:20:41.905
in the entryways and so on and
then of course are always

00:20:41.905 --> 00:20:45.690
stunned to find when something
is stolen from them,

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:51.131
how could this be?
And I tell them lock your doors

00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:56.052
but they still don't believe me.
Maybe you'll now believe Hobbes

00:20:56.052 --> 00:20:59.371
if you don't believe me.
So the state of nature,

00:20:59.371 --> 00:21:03.390
it's a state of insecurity,
it's a state of conflict.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:07.249
How do we get out of it?
This is of course the huge

00:21:07.249 --> 00:21:12.589
issue that Hobbes asks for the
rest of--for much of the book.

00:21:12.589 --> 00:21:16.671
What do we do to get out of
this state of nature to enter a

00:21:16.671 --> 00:21:20.049
condition of civil society and
civilized life?

00:21:20.049 --> 00:21:24.652
How do I give up my right to do
whatever is in my power to

00:21:24.652 --> 00:21:27.640
secure my person or my
possessions,

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.101
when I have no expectation,
you might say,

00:21:31.101 --> 00:21:35.660
that others around me are
prepared to do so as well?

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.774
This is sort of a classic
example of what economists and

00:21:39.774 --> 00:21:43.740
other people like them call the
prisoner's dilemma.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:48.917
Why should I act in such a way
if I have no expectation or

00:21:48.917 --> 00:21:53.186
reasonable expectation that
those around me will

00:21:53.186 --> 00:21:57.539
reciprocate?
Hobbes' members of a state of

00:21:57.539 --> 00:22:03.440
nature seem to be in a classic
prisoner's dilemma problem.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.842
Maybe we can say,
we could say or Hobbes could

00:22:06.842 --> 00:22:11.227
say, that laying down our right
to do all things in seeking

00:22:11.227 --> 00:22:15.084
peace with others is the
rational thing to do in the

00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:19.304
condition of nature.
We are all rational actors and

00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:23.890
therefore it is rational for us
to seek and to desire peace,

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.294
but note that that is exactly
what Hobbes does not say,

00:22:28.294 --> 00:22:32.436
he does not say this.
Far from having a sort of

00:22:32.436 --> 00:22:37.152
rational actor model of
politics, he operates with an

00:22:37.152 --> 00:22:41.217
irrational actor model.
He assumes that it is not

00:22:41.217 --> 00:22:45.246
reason but our passions that are
the dominant force of human

00:22:45.246 --> 00:22:47.840
psychology, our desires,
our aversions,

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.725
our passions.
And although I have said that

00:22:51.725 --> 00:22:56.852
Hobbes has emphasized the
diversity of our passions there

00:22:56.852 --> 00:23:02.436
are still two main passions that
he feels universally dominate

00:23:02.436 --> 00:23:07.930
human nature and these two
passions are pride and fear.

00:23:14.819 --> 00:23:17.849
Pride and fear,
these are the Hobbesian

00:23:17.849 --> 00:23:21.996
equivalents of the two
great--what Machiavelli called

00:23:21.996 --> 00:23:26.787
humors you remember,
the two humors of the two great

00:23:26.787 --> 00:23:30.686
social classes,
the desires of the rich and

00:23:30.686 --> 00:23:36.256
powerful as it were to rule over
others and the desire of the

00:23:36.256 --> 00:23:40.765
weak not to be ruled.
Machiavelli called those the

00:23:40.765 --> 00:23:43.309
two umori,
the two humors.

00:23:43.309 --> 00:23:47.069
And Hobbes similarly works with
a kind of model.

00:23:47.069 --> 00:23:49.641
He's a great political
psychologist,

00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:52.799
the two great passions of pride
and fear.

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:57.499
Pride, he says,
is the passion for preeminence,

00:23:57.499 --> 00:24:03.630
the desire to be first and also
to be seen to be first in the

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:07.235
great race of life.
Prideful people,

00:24:07.235 --> 00:24:10.217
he tells us,
are those overflowing with

00:24:10.217 --> 00:24:14.691
confidence about their own
abilities to succeed and we all

00:24:14.691 --> 00:24:18.450
know people like this,
don't we, like Yale students?

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:23.029
They're all overflowing with
confidence, kind of alpha types.

00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:29.094
Machiavelli might call them
sort of manly men who are fully

00:24:29.094 --> 00:24:34.680
confident about their abilities.
And yet Hobbes is a great

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:39.588
debunker of human pride.
Pride is equivalent to what he

00:24:39.588 --> 00:24:44.451
calls vanity or vainglory.
It is a kind of exaggerated

00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:48.069
confidence in one's own power
and ability.

00:24:48.069 --> 00:24:51.444
It is pride,
the desire to lord it over

00:24:51.444 --> 00:24:55.973
others and to have one's
superiority acknowledged by

00:24:55.973 --> 00:24:59.992
others,
that is the great problem for

00:24:59.992 --> 00:25:05.614
Hobbes to be averted.
But if pride for him is one of

00:25:05.614 --> 00:25:10.806
his great universal passions so
is its opposite,

00:25:10.806 --> 00:25:13.817
fear.
Hobbes makes the fear of death

00:25:13.817 --> 00:25:17.789
that may come to us at any time
in the state of nature,

00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:21.292
perhaps he exaggerates this,
by making it appear that the

00:25:21.292 --> 00:25:24.920
state of nature is a kind of
existential condition in which

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.859
death can come to you at almost
any moment.

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:32.889
But there is more to fear than
this, simply fear of death,

00:25:32.889 --> 00:25:37.302
although Hobbes emphasizes and
dramatically perhaps

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:43.027
overemphasizes this.
Fear is not just the desire to

00:25:43.027 --> 00:25:49.519
avoid death but to avoid losing,
you might say again,

00:25:49.519 --> 00:25:55.249
in the great race of life,
to avoid losing and to be seen

00:25:55.249 --> 00:25:59.533
as a loser.
It is the desire to avoid the

00:25:59.533 --> 00:26:04.930
shame of being seen by others as
losing out somehow.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.359
There is a social quality
clearly to both of these

00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:12.980
passions, pride and fear,
one again the desire to have

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.075
one's preeminence esteemed by
others, fear,

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:21.170
the desire to avoid shame and
dishonor.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:25.428
How we are seen by others is a
crucial cardinal part of Hobbes'

00:26:25.428 --> 00:26:29.000
moral psychology and each of us,
he says, contain.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.251
These do not simply represent
two classes of individuals,

00:26:33.251 --> 00:26:37.714
two classes of persons.
Each of us contains these two

00:26:37.714 --> 00:26:41.428
warring, you might say,
elements within us,

00:26:41.428 --> 00:26:45.761
both self-assertion and fear of
the consequence of

00:26:45.761 --> 00:26:51.803
self-assertion.
The question is for Hobbes,

00:26:51.803 --> 00:26:58.900
how do we tame these passions?
It is most of all pride that

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.202
Hobbes wants to tame and of
course the very title of his

00:27:03.202 --> 00:27:07.347
book, Leviathan,
he tell us later on comes from

00:27:07.347 --> 00:27:09.400
what?
Do you remember?

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.320
Where does it come from?
Who remembers?

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:18.283
Passage from what?
Job, Book of Job,

00:27:18.283 --> 00:27:23.990
where he refers to Leviathan as
king of the children of pride.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:31.877
The book is based on a biblical
metaphor about overcoming or

00:27:31.877 --> 00:27:37.200
subduing pride.
As the great Marsellus Wallace

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:42.081
says in the film Pulp Fiction,
pride never helps,

00:27:42.081 --> 00:27:45.539
it only hurts,
if you remember that

00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:49.519
magnificent speech.
Fear, Hobbes says,

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:54.396
is the passion to reckon on,
is the passion to be reckoned

00:27:54.396 --> 00:27:56.942
on.
It is fear, not reason,

00:27:56.942 --> 00:28:01.804
that leads us to abandon the
state of nature and sue for

00:28:01.804 --> 00:28:04.598
peace.
The passions that incline men

00:28:04.598 --> 00:28:07.630
to peace, Hobbes writes,
are fear of death.

00:28:11.079 --> 00:28:14.181
This is not to say that Hobbes
believes fear to be the

00:28:14.181 --> 00:28:16.580
naturally stronger of the two
passions;

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:21.169
in fact, far from it.
There are many people certainly

00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:25.122
even around us who Hobbes
believes do not fear death as

00:28:25.122 --> 00:28:28.192
they should,
the proud aristocrat who

00:28:28.192 --> 00:28:33.041
prefers death before dishonor,
the religious zealot prepared

00:28:33.041 --> 00:28:37.889
to sacrifice his life and of
course those of others in order

00:28:37.889 --> 00:28:42.738
to achieve the rewards of heaven
and of course just the risk

00:28:42.738 --> 00:28:47.833
taking individual who seeks to
climb Mount Everest just for the

00:28:47.833 --> 00:28:52.854
honor and esteem involved.
And it is part of the broader

00:28:52.854 --> 00:28:56.920
educational or pedagogic
function of Leviathan to

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.333
help us see,
Hobbes thinks,

00:28:59.333 --> 00:29:03.990
the dangers of pride and the
advantages of peace.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:09.099
Properly directed,
fear leads to peace.

00:29:09.099 --> 00:29:14.119
Fear is the basis,
even of what Hobbes calls the

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:20.099
various laws of nature,
that lead us to civil society.

00:29:20.099 --> 00:29:24.729
The laws of nature for Hobbes
are described as a precept or a

00:29:24.729 --> 00:29:28.895
general rule of reason that
every man ought to endeavor

00:29:28.895 --> 00:29:33.679
peace and it is out of fear that
we begin to reason and see the

00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:38.268
advantages of society;
reason is dependent upon the

00:29:38.268 --> 00:29:43.449
passions, upon fear.
The first and most fundamental

00:29:43.449 --> 00:29:48.264
law of nature,
he says, is to seek peace and

00:29:48.264 --> 00:29:51.639
follow it.
Not only should one seek peace

00:29:51.639 --> 00:29:55.349
but we have an obligation,
he says, to lay down our arms,

00:29:55.349 --> 00:29:59.109
to lay down our right to all
things on the condition that

00:29:59.109 --> 00:30:02.400
others around us are prepared to
do so as well.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.152
And Hobbes goes on to enumerate
19 laws of nature,

00:30:06.152 --> 00:30:10.070
I won't go into all of them,
19 laws of nature that

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:14.710
constitute a kind of framework
for establishing civil society.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:19.368
These laws he even compares as
his equivalent of the Golden

00:30:19.368 --> 00:30:24.026
Rule which he states in the
negative: Do not do unto others

00:30:24.026 --> 00:30:27.640
what you would not have them do
unto you.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.808
Here is Hobbes' rewriting of
the Golden Rule in terms of

00:30:31.808 --> 00:30:36.052
these laws of nature but these
raise a question for us as

00:30:36.052 --> 00:30:37.720
readers of Hobbes.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.980
Right?
Don't they?

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.529
What is the status of the laws
of nature?

00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:49.579
What is the moral status,
if any, of these laws?

00:30:49.579 --> 00:30:53.381
Hobbes, as we see,
sometimes writes as a sort of

00:30:53.381 --> 00:30:58.557
scientist or proto-scientist for
whom nature and one supposes the

00:30:58.557 --> 00:31:03.410
laws of nature operate with the
same kind of necessity as the

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:07.958
laws of physical attraction.
That's how he often writes

00:31:07.958 --> 00:31:11.416
about human behavior,
that we obey the same laws of

00:31:11.416 --> 00:31:15.220
physical attraction as do any
other bodies that we might

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.176
choose to describe.
They describe how bodies in

00:31:19.176 --> 00:31:24.279
motion always and necessarily
behave, these laws of nature.

00:31:24.279 --> 00:31:27.940
And yet at the same time,
Hobbes writes as a moralist for

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:32.074
whom the laws of nature,
he calls "precepts of reason"

00:31:32.074 --> 00:31:36.859
or general rules according to
which we are forbidden to do

00:31:36.859 --> 00:31:40.580
anything destructive of life."
In this sense,

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.297
the laws of nature,
as he describes them,

00:31:43.297 --> 00:31:46.490
appear to be moral laws with
moral commands,

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:51.498
commands you not to do anything
that is destructive of life,

00:31:51.498 --> 00:31:55.568
your own or that of others,
and these moral laws,

00:31:55.568 --> 00:31:58.938
in this sense,
we have presumably the freedom

00:31:58.938 --> 00:32:03.261
to obey them or disobey them.
If they acted with a kind of

00:32:03.261 --> 00:32:06.468
mechanical necessity or even
geometric necessity,

00:32:06.468 --> 00:32:10.009
they could not possibly be
moral laws in that way.

00:32:10.009 --> 00:32:14.128
They can only be moral if there
is some semblance of human

00:32:14.128 --> 00:32:17.307
choice or will expressed in the
relationship,

00:32:17.307 --> 00:32:21.753
our ability to do otherwise.
So these laws of nature,

00:32:21.753 --> 00:32:25.753
seek peace and so on,
do not simply seem to be

00:32:25.753 --> 00:32:29.220
descriptive of how people do
behave.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.513
They seem to be prescriptive of
how people ought to behave and

00:32:33.513 --> 00:32:38.018
this Hobbes even suggests at the
end of chapter 15 when he writes

00:32:38.018 --> 00:32:42.567
about the laws of nature,
"these dictates of reason men

00:32:42.567 --> 00:32:47.408
used to call by the name
‘laws' but improperly for they

00:32:47.408 --> 00:32:52.250
are conclusions or theorems
according to what conduces to

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:58.072
the conversation of mankind."
These used to be called laws of

00:32:58.072 --> 00:33:01.140
nature, he says,
but improperly.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.636
So if they are only improperly
laws of nature why does Hobbes

00:33:05.636 --> 00:33:09.309
continue to use the term?
Why does he use this

00:33:09.309 --> 00:33:14.265
terminology of "laws of nature"?
In a sense, this might simply

00:33:14.265 --> 00:33:18.737
be Hobbes' way of paying homage
to the ancient tradition of

00:33:18.737 --> 00:33:22.900
natural law going back to the
medieval scholastics,

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:27.390
to the stoics,
and perhaps even beyond them.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:31.911
The natural laws for Hobbes are
not divine commands or

00:33:31.911 --> 00:33:36.261
ordinances, he says,
but they are rules of practical

00:33:36.261 --> 00:33:41.379
reason figured out by us as the
optimal means of securing our

00:33:41.379 --> 00:33:44.435
well-being.
These laws of nature,

00:33:44.435 --> 00:33:47.876
as he describes them,
do not issue categorical

00:33:47.876 --> 00:33:51.700
commands so much as sort of
hypothetical rules.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:55.951
If you want X, do Y;
if you want peace,

00:33:55.951 --> 00:34:00.461
here are the means to it.
And he calls these laws,

00:34:00.461 --> 00:34:04.281
these 19 laws of nature,
the true and only moral

00:34:04.281 --> 00:34:07.471
philosophy.
So you can see in that passage

00:34:07.471 --> 00:34:11.232
Hobbes takes himself to be a
moralist writing within the

00:34:11.232 --> 00:34:13.900
great tradition of moral
philosophy.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:18.211
These laws of nature are for
him the true and only moral

00:34:18.211 --> 00:34:21.153
philosophy.
Well, this brings me to some

00:34:21.153 --> 00:34:24.587
criticisms or at least some
questions about Hobbes'

00:34:24.587 --> 00:34:27.059
conception of the laws of
nature.

00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:31.400
What are we to make of these
laws, as I've asked before?

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.508
In one sense,
there seems to be a genuine

00:34:34.508 --> 00:34:39.481
moral content to Hobbes' laws of
nature which can be reduced to a

00:34:39.481 --> 00:34:42.667
single formula:
Seek peace above all other

00:34:42.667 --> 00:34:47.232
goods.
Hobbes, more than anyone else,

00:34:47.232 --> 00:34:52.440
wants us to value the virtues
of civility.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:57.376
Those, you might say,
summed up in a word are what

00:34:57.376 --> 00:35:02.909
the 19 laws of nature command.
The civility entails the

00:35:02.909 --> 00:35:06.180
virtues of peace,
equity, fairness,

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:10.813
playing by the rules.
Peace is for Hobbes a moral

00:35:10.813 --> 00:35:16.063
good and the virtues are those
qualities of behavior that tend

00:35:16.063 --> 00:35:20.280
to peace and vices are those
that lead to war.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:26.140
Consider the disadvantages of
war and the benefits of peace.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.639
Here is what Hobbes writes.
"In such a condition,

00:35:28.639 --> 00:35:32.090
that is the state of nature,
there is no place for industry

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:35.482
because the fruit thereof is
uncertain and consequently no

00:35:35.482 --> 00:35:38.991
culture of the earth,
no navigation nor building nor

00:35:38.991 --> 00:35:42.651
instruments of moving and
removing things as require much

00:35:42.651 --> 00:35:45.213
force,
no knowledge of the face of the

00:35:45.213 --> 00:35:48.269
earth, no account of time,
no arts, no letters,

00:35:48.269 --> 00:35:53.037
no society and which is worst
of all continual fear and danger

00:35:53.037 --> 00:35:56.040
of violent death."
This is again the sort of

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.440
existential condition in which
Hobbes wants to put us in the

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.610
state of nature and all the
benefits he lists there,

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.736
he enumerates,
that are denied to us in such a

00:36:05.736 --> 00:36:08.853
condition, again no knowledge,
no geography,

00:36:08.853 --> 00:36:12.699
no cultivation of the earth,
no navigation or building.

00:36:12.699 --> 00:36:16.962
All of these things are the
fruits of peace,

00:36:16.962 --> 00:36:19.864
he tells us.
But at this point,

00:36:19.864 --> 00:36:24.156
a careful reader such as all of
yourselves no doubt,

00:36:24.156 --> 00:36:30.230
would no doubt be suggesting,
I've gone too far in suggesting

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:36.445
or calling Hobbes a moral
philosopher whose motto in a way

00:36:36.445 --> 00:36:42.770
could be summed up in the phrase
"Give peace a chance."

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:46.223
Is that what Hobbes believed?
Why is the peace the highest

00:36:46.223 --> 00:36:48.710
good anyway?
Why not justice?

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:51.910
Why not honor?
Why not piety?

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:56.833
Why not the examined life?
What makes peace so good for

00:36:56.833 --> 00:36:59.873
Hobbes?
Well, I've given a number of…

00:36:59.873 --> 00:37:04.580
have quoted him on a number of
reasons but one suggestion might

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:09.210
be that it is not so much peace
alone that Hobbes cherishes as

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:12.550
life.
Peace is a means to life.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:15.517
Every creature,
he says, has a built-in desire

00:37:15.517 --> 00:37:18.286
to preserve itself,
to persevere in its own

00:37:18.286 --> 00:37:21.445
existence,
to continue in its own steady

00:37:21.445 --> 00:37:24.915
state you might say,
and to resist invasion or

00:37:24.915 --> 00:37:28.445
encroachment by others.
We are all endowed,

00:37:28.445 --> 00:37:33.424
he says, with a kind of natural
right to life and the desire to

00:37:33.424 --> 00:37:37.440
preserve oneself is not just a
biological fact,

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.241
although it is also that,
it is for him a moral right,

00:37:41.241 --> 00:37:45.715
it is a moral entitlement,
every being has a fundamental

00:37:45.715 --> 00:37:49.974
right to its own life.
We not only have a right to our

00:37:49.974 --> 00:37:54.360
lives but to do whatever we
regard as needful to protect our

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.281
lives.
And again, this is not simply a

00:37:57.281 --> 00:38:00.665
brute fact of nature.
It is a moral entitlement for

00:38:00.665 --> 00:38:03.559
Hobbes, the source of human
worth and dignity.

00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:07.325
But now you will suggest,
I've really gone too far,

00:38:07.325 --> 00:38:11.317
attributing to Hobbes a
doctrine of human dignity that

00:38:11.317 --> 00:38:15.911
one might expect to find in a
philosopher like Kant or someone

00:38:15.911 --> 00:38:19.136
else.
Didn't Hobbes cynically write

00:38:19.136 --> 00:38:22.855
in chapter 10,
"the value or worth of a man is

00:38:22.855 --> 00:38:28.021
of all things his price,"
what price we will fetch in the

00:38:28.021 --> 00:38:32.713
marketplace no doubt,
the value or worth of a man is

00:38:32.713 --> 00:38:36.349
his price,
a phrase incidentally quoted by

00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:41.308
Karl Marx to indicate the sheer
heartlessness of the kind of the

00:38:41.308 --> 00:38:46.110
bourgeoisie society that Hobbes
was hoping to bring about.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:50.505
And doesn't Hobbes' materialism
and his sort of mechanistic

00:38:50.505 --> 00:38:55.203
theory of nature seem to detract
from any inherent worth of the

00:38:55.203 --> 00:38:58.743
individual?
There seems to be something to

00:38:58.743 --> 00:39:03.789
that and yet Hobbes certainly
regards life as a precious good,

00:39:03.789 --> 00:39:08.915
perhaps the most precious good
of all, and he writes with a

00:39:08.915 --> 00:39:13.599
lively sense of how fragile and
endangered life is.

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:18.566
The work as a whole can be seen
as an effort to dispel what he

00:39:18.566 --> 00:39:23.171
believes to be false beliefs,
false doctrines and beliefs,

00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:27.335
that disguise the truth from
us, truth about the value of

00:39:27.335 --> 00:39:28.815
life;
for example,

00:39:28.815 --> 00:39:33.462
beliefs about the afterlife and
all beliefs that detract from an

00:39:33.462 --> 00:39:36.929
appreciation for the value of
life as it is.

00:39:36.929 --> 00:39:42.344
This provides the moral basis
of what I would call Hobbes'

00:39:42.344 --> 00:39:47.855
humanitarianism and yet that
humanitarianism seems to raise

00:39:47.855 --> 00:39:52.661
further problems.
Doesn't Hobbes or does Hobbes'

00:39:52.661 --> 00:39:57.440
attempt to instill in us,
the readers of his book,

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:01.947
his attempt to instill in us an
appreciation for life and the

00:40:01.947 --> 00:40:06.194
value of life,
does this simultaneously create

00:40:06.194 --> 00:40:11.204
an aversion to risk,
an extreme fear of conflict and

00:40:11.204 --> 00:40:16.298
challenge or disorder?
You could say is this constant

00:40:16.298 --> 00:40:21.840
fear that Hobbes harps on fear
of death and the value of life,

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:27.194
to put it rather rudely,
is this not another word for

00:40:27.194 --> 00:40:30.382
cowardice?
Does Hobbes' emphasis on the

00:40:30.382 --> 00:40:33.800
preservation of life as the
supreme moral value,

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:37.890
does this turn his mighty
Leviathan into a kind of

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:42.199
commonwealth of cowards?
Where Aristotle made the

00:40:42.199 --> 00:40:47.722
courage of men in combat a
central virtue of his ethics,

00:40:47.722 --> 00:40:53.344
Hobbes pointedly omits courage
from his list of the moral

00:40:53.344 --> 00:40:55.753
virtues.
At one point,

00:40:55.753 --> 00:41:00.506
he even suggests that courage
is really just a species of

00:41:00.506 --> 00:41:05.174
rashness and his example of
courage comes from duels and

00:41:05.174 --> 00:41:10.182
duel fighting which he says will
be always honorable but are

00:41:10.182 --> 00:41:12.842
unlawful.
"For duels," he says,

00:41:12.842 --> 00:41:16.007
"are many times effects of
courage and the ground of

00:41:16.007 --> 00:41:20.039
courage is always strength or
skill though for the most part,"

00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:24.840
he says, "they be effects of
rash speaking and the fear of

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:28.630
dishonor in one or both of the
combatants."

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:32.264
In other words,
courage for him again is a form

00:41:32.264 --> 00:41:36.056
of vanity or pride,
the desire not to appear less

00:41:36.056 --> 00:41:39.414
than another.
It is a form of rashness,

00:41:39.414 --> 00:41:42.636
he says.
And that suspicion is further

00:41:42.636 --> 00:41:47.025
carried out in Hobbes' very
interesting treatment of

00:41:47.025 --> 00:41:52.190
military conscription which he
talks about in chapter 21.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:57.209
There he describes battle,
as he says, "a mutual running

00:41:57.209 --> 00:42:02.958
away" to armies confronting one
another he describes as a mutual

00:42:02.958 --> 00:42:07.739
running away,
and furthermore he says when it

00:42:07.739 --> 00:42:13.468
comes to conscription there
should be allowance made for

00:42:13.468 --> 00:42:18.990
those that he calls "men of
natural timorousness,"

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:23.099
cowards in other words.
A man that has commanded as a

00:42:23.099 --> 00:42:26.849
soldier, Hobbes writes,
to fight against the enemy

00:42:26.849 --> 00:42:30.982
though his sovereign has the
right enough to punish his

00:42:30.982 --> 00:42:34.119
refusal with death may
nevertheless,

00:42:34.119 --> 00:42:37.292
Hobbes writes,
in many cases refuse without

00:42:37.292 --> 00:42:40.691
injustice as when he
substituteth a sufficient

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:43.961
solider in his place.
In other words,

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:48.749
Hobbes' view of this is why do
the fighting yourself,

00:42:48.749 --> 00:42:53.170
if you can get someone else to
do it for you?

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:57.335
There is no intrinsic virtue in
courage or battle,

00:42:57.335 --> 00:43:01.840
if you can get somebody else to
do the job for you,

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.934
a sort of perfect description,
I think, of our volunteer army,

00:43:06.934 --> 00:43:11.945
how we pay people to do this
difficult and dangerous work for

00:43:11.945 --> 00:43:12.530
us.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.955
But the question is,
can even a Hobbesian society,

00:43:20.955 --> 00:43:24.199
one which insists on rules and
so on,

00:43:24.199 --> 00:43:27.748
can a Hobbesian society do
entirely without-- Professor

00:43:27.748 --> 00:43:29.430
Steven Smith: Anyway,

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:48.710
can a Hobbesian society do
without what we might call them

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:52.058
the manly virtues,
the civic virtues,

00:43:52.058 --> 00:43:55.880
pride, love of honor that
Hobbes seems to condemn?

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.800
Consider the case of Ralph
Esposito.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:07.762
Who is Ralph Esposito, you ask?
His name is not in the index of

00:44:07.762 --> 00:44:12.134
Hobbes' book but Mr.
Esposito is a New York City

00:44:12.134 --> 00:44:17.342
fireman who came to Branford
College to be a Master's Tea

00:44:17.342 --> 00:44:23.293
guest not long after 9/11 and at
length he discussed there people

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:28.036
like himself who daily risk
their lives running into

00:44:28.036 --> 00:44:32.686
building burning--burning
buildings to rescue total

00:44:32.686 --> 00:44:37.389
strangers.
Why do people do this?

00:44:37.389 --> 00:44:41.451
Is it because some people have
a kind of built in sense of

00:44:41.451 --> 00:44:44.730
thumos,
that wonderful Platonic term,

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.361
pride, courage,
love of risk that no society,

00:44:48.361 --> 00:44:51.909
not even a Hobbesian one,
can do without?

00:44:51.909 --> 00:44:56.388
Even Hobbes' society presumably
cannot do without a fire

00:44:56.388 --> 00:44:59.320
department or a police
department;

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:04.357
yet, if one were to follow
Hobbes' risk averse psychology,

00:45:04.357 --> 00:45:09.660
if one were to follow the 19
laws of nature that advise us to

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.929
seek peace and to avoid
conflict,

00:45:12.929 --> 00:45:17.835
why would anyone ever become a
fireman, a soldier,

00:45:17.835 --> 00:45:21.840
a risk taker,
a policeman of any sort?

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.864
Why would anyone ever risk
one's life for one's country or

00:45:25.864 --> 00:45:29.677
a cause just to help other
people, people that we don't

00:45:29.677 --> 00:45:32.360
know and probably will never
know?

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.922
Even in the passage that I
cited earlier,

00:45:35.922 --> 00:45:40.820
where Hobbes describes the
benefits of civil society,

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:44.920
he speaks of activities like
navigation, exploration and

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.398
industry.
Presumably, these are

00:45:47.398 --> 00:45:52.214
activities that are all engaged
in risk taking behavior of one

00:45:52.214 --> 00:45:56.794
kind or another that seem not to
be able to be explained by

00:45:56.794 --> 00:46:01.700
Hobbes' law of nature alone.
So the question I want to leave

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:06.077
you with today and that I want
to pick up again on Wednesday

00:46:06.077 --> 00:46:09.416
is, in the end,
what do societies require more

00:46:09.416 --> 00:46:12.666
of?
Do they require more of Hobbes'

00:46:12.666 --> 00:46:17.465
men of natural timorousness or
do they require more Ralph

00:46:17.465 --> 00:46:21.066
Espositos?
And on that we'll finish up

00:46:21.066 --> 00:46:22.466
Hobbes on Wednesday.

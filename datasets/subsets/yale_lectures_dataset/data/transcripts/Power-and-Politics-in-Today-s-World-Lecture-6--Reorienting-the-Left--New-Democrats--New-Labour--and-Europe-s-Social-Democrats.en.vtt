00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.440
- I started the lecture last
Thursday by playing a clip

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.930
of Michael Foot making fun of
Sir Keith Joseph who had been

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.382
the intellectual architect of Thatcherism.

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:29.490
With his conjurer's trick,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.020
and said at the end of the day

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.900
that the joke was on Michael Foot,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.900
because he thought Thatcher
would be a flash in the pan,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.200
and she went on to be Prime
Minister for 11 1/2 years

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.530
and went on fundamentally to restructure

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.378
the British economy and
political landscape as we saw.

00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:58.093
I want to start today
with a clip from his,

00:01:01.114 --> 00:01:04.330
his comrade in arms Tony Benn,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.760
who had been his staunchest
supporter on the left

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.620
of the Labor Party throughout the 1980s.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.820
And actually ran for the deputy leadership

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.290
when Michael Foot became leader In 1981

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.440
and lost narrowly to Healy.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.440
But this is Tony Benn on
the day after Thatcher

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.830
has announced she was stepping down,

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.703
evaluating the Thatcher legacy.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.797
- [Tony] Despite the fact we've been

00:01:39.797 --> 00:01:42.140
told we're an entrepreneurial society,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.550
this is a country today that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.060
has an utter contempt for skill.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.490
You talk to people who dig coal,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.150
run trains, doctors, nurses,
dentists, toolmakers,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.270
nobody in Britain is interested in them.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.080
The whole of the so-called
entrepreneurial society

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.920
has focused on the city news
we get in every bulletin

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.860
telling us what's happened
to the pound sterling

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.050
to three points of decimals against

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.140
a basket of European currency.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.470
Skill is what built this country,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.290
strength and it is treated with contempt.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.050
I must confess the auctioning
off of public assets,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.350
particularly the latest

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.780
disgusting Frankenstein advertisements

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.860
which told me more about the
mentality of the Minister

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.660
who devised the scheme than
it did about the sale itself,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.330
these are assets built up by the labor

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.590
of those who worked in electricity

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.830
and by the taxpayer who
put the equipment in,

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.240
now to be auctioned
off at half their price

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.000
to make a profit from
the tax cut for the rich

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.290
before the next election comes.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.100
If these were local councilors

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.770
they would be before the
courts for wilful misconduct,

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.350
and because they are ministers

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.785
and then some of them later go on

00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:58.800
the boards of the
company's they privatized,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.740
they are treated as businessmen

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.750
who know better how to handle it

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.630
as members of the board of directors

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.250
than allegedly they did
as ministers responsible.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.790
The undermining of the trade unions

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.990
with less rights in Britain

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.790
than they have in Eastern Europe.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.010
The tax cuts for the rich and
benefit cuts for the poor,

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.330
the censorship of the media,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.740
the abuse by security services

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.940
the restriction of civil liberties.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.280
And when we look back in the 1980s

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.170
we will see many victims of market forces.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.782
I do not share the general view

00:03:31.782 --> 00:03:35.530
that market forces are the
basis for political liberty,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.950
every time I see a person
in a cardboard box in London

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.890
I say that person is a
victim of market forces.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.630
Every time I see a
pensioner who can't manage

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.960
a victim of market forces.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.650
The sick who are waiting
for medical treatment

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.240
that they could accelerate
by private insurance,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.300
they are the victims of market forces.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.866
And with the disappearance
of the Prime Minister

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:02.120
who's a great ideologue,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.570
I mean her strength was

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.940
that she understood a
certain view of life,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.490
and when she goes, and she's gone,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.733
there will be a great ideological vacuum.

00:04:12.978 --> 00:04:14.190
It's no good saying we will run

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.940
the market forces better than she did,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.400
because her whole philosophy was

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.740
that you measured the price of everything

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.243
and the value of nothing.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.310
And I had one experience the other day

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.070
which confirmed me in my view

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.530
that she hasn't really changed

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.530
the thinking or culture
of the British people.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.990
I don't know how many people
as I do travel on trains,

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.570
but I go regularly on the trains

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.611
and I see all the little businessmen

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.300
with their calculators
working out their cash flow

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.800
frowning at people,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.630
looking and glaring at each other.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.950
Thatcherite trains,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.920
the train of the competitive society.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.990
Coming back from Chesterfield

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.763
the other day the train broke down

00:04:50.763 --> 00:04:54.370
and it wholly changed, somebody came in

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.030
and said have a cup of
tea from my Thermos.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.550
Then people looked after
each other's children

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.920
and a young couple talked to me

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.197
and I said after about half an hour,

00:05:02.197 --> 00:05:03.197
"How long have you been married?"

00:05:03.197 --> 00:05:04.920
"We met on the train", they said.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.617
And a woman said, "Will
you get off at Derby

00:05:06.617 --> 00:05:09.170
"and ring my son in Swansea
because he'll be worried."

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.510
By the time we got to London
we were a socialist train.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.470
Because you can't change human nature.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.280
There is good and bad in everybody,

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.800
and for 10 years it is the bad.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.860
And the good that has
been denounced as lunatic,

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.460
out of touch, cloud cuckoo
land, extremist and militant.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.180
And that's what the
party opposite have done,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.500
they don't quite yet know,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.910
they think it's the retirement
of a popular headmistress

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.490
under circumstances some might regret.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.670
Actually, they killed the
source of their own philosophy

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.033
and opened the way for
quite different ideas.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.700
- So there you have again a
leader of the Labor Party,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.590
deputy leader of the Labor Party

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.350
who's extremely eloquent,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.950
but in contrast to Foot a decade earlier,

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.970
very bitter about the
legacy of Thatcherism.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.200
And more important for our purposes today,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.950
despite his story about

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.590
the socialist train and human nature,

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.920
he was actually in denial,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.920
because Michael Foot and Tony
Benn continued to believe

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.436
that this ghastly interregnum was now over

00:06:24.436 --> 00:06:27.460
and there would be a resurgence of

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.830
the traditional left, a
traditional Labor Party.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.240
By then of course Labor had been in

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.550
the wilderness since 1979

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.150
and it would actually continue
to be in the wilderness

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.130
for the next several elections

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.880
and not come back into power until 1997.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.740
And when they did finally come back into

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.280
the power it was under the leadership of

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.560
a very different Prime Minister

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.510
with very different
priorities and views about

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.693
the nature of the Labor Party
and how it could govern.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.270
- Across the nation, across class,

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.090
across political
boundaries the Labor Party

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.650
is once again able to represent
all the British people.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.760
We are the mainstream
voice in politics today.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.830
A believe in society, working together,

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.550
solidarity, cooperation, partnership.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.800
These are our words, this is my socialism.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.640
(audience applauds)

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.830
It's not the socialism
of Marx or state control,

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.580
it is rooted in a
straightforward view of society.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.760
In the understanding that
the individual does best

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.900
in a strong and decent community

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.060
of people with principles

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.960
and standards and common aims and values.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.470
A new politics,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.753
a politics of courage
and honesty and trust.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.073
Now it means telling it as it is,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.550
it means not opposing everything

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.960
every other party does for the sake of it.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.933
Politicians are looked to by
the people for leadership,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.720
and leadership is about having

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.973
the courage to say no as well as yes.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.447
Now even this week I heard people say

00:08:15.447 --> 00:08:17.950
that a Labor government must repeal all

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.000
the Tory trade union laws.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.810
Now there's not a single
person in this country

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.940
who believes that we shall actually do it,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.670
no one believes strike
balance should be abandoned.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.680
So why do we say it?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.731
We shouldn't, and I won't.

00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:33.060
I have said and I mean I am committed

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.850
to the goal of full employment

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.014
we will develop the plans to achieve it.

00:08:37.014 --> 00:08:41.420
But I won't ever pretend that
I can deliver it overnight.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.630
It requires a modern constitution,

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.567
that says what we are in terms

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.545
the public cannot misunderstand

00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:49.424
and the Tories cannot misrepresent.

00:08:49.424 --> 00:08:50.480
(audience applauds)

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.010
The next election will offer us

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.240
the chance to change our country.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.660
Not just to promise
change, but to achieve it,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.570
the historic goal of
another Labor government,

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.570
our party New Labour,

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.410
our mission new Britain,

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.202
New Labour, new Britain.

00:09:06.202 --> 00:09:09.202
(audience applauds)

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.950
- So that was Tony Blair speaking

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.580
to the Labor Party Conference in 1995.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.110
And the reason that was
such an important speech,

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.033
once that was the speech in which,

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.230
when he speaks about

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.240
the new Constitution for the Labor Party,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.260
he's talking about
getting rid of clause four

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.670
of the Labor Party's Constitution

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.040
which called for

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.070
the nationalization of
the means of production,

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.130
distribution and exchange,

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.766
and it hearkened back to
the original founding of

00:09:44.766 --> 00:09:49.020
the Labor Party in the early
part of the 20th century

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.100
as a Marxist Socialist party.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.460
And there had been a battle
for the soul of the Labor Party

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:00.453
that had gone on since Thatcher's years,

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.560
actually it was before
Blair, it was Neil Kinnock,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.980
and after Kinnock it was John Smith,

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.200
but Blair finally won this battle,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.930
he got rid of clause four

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.332
and reoriented the Labor Party to become

00:10:15.332 --> 00:10:19.310
a party that they thought
could be competitive in

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:24.310
the new world that I was
describing to you last time.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.540
Now similar things were
going on elsewhere,

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.540
including back here.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.050
The Democrats felt that
they had been pulled to

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.455
the left too much in the decade since

00:10:36.455 --> 00:10:40.590
the McGovern Frazier reforms
of the Democratic Party

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.270
which had greatly
empowered the grass roots.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.150
I'll talk more about that later,

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.513
and had produced candlelight
dates like George McGovern

00:10:49.513 --> 00:10:51.830
or subjected Jimmy Carter

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:56.830
to a debilitating primary
challenge from Jimmy Carter

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:58.600
which many thought had contributed

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.060
to his defeat by Ronald Reagan in 1980.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.990
And there was a similar
sense within the Labor Party,

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.260
within the Democrats that just
as something like New Labour

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:15.040
which Tony Blair was
bringing into existence

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.040
needed to happen in the US as
well to the Democratic Party,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.810
and there was something formed called

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.991
the Democratic Leadership
Council and Bill Clinton

00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:29.991
was one of its first leaders.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.840
And the agenda of the
Democratic leadership Council

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.950
was very much similar to
the agenda of New Labour,

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.730
just to give you a flavor,

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:44.730
this is Bill Clinton
actually speaking in 1988,

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.893
before he ran for the
nomination four years later.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.800
- Take this fight about civil rights,

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.770
the Republicans have set
up so that if you're for

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.860
the civil rights bill
you've got to be for quotas,

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.310
so that if you're not for quotas

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.220
we have to say you're for discrimination.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.350
It's a bogus debate,

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.250
and the White House ought
to be ashamed of itself

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.349
for breaking up the honest.

00:12:10.349 --> 00:12:13.349
(audience applauds)

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.390
For breaking up the honest attempt of

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.550
the Business Roundtable

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.470
and the civil rights
groups in this country

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.540
to have a new choice you
can have economic growth,

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.050
small-business vitality,

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.700
you don't wake up every day being scared

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.770
to death of a lawsuit,

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.210
but we protect women and minorities

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.450
and people who deserve it

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.220
from unfair discrimination on the job,

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.453
which we all know still
exists in this country.

00:12:36.453 --> 00:12:39.453
(audience applauds)

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.083
Take the debate about poor children,

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.150
the way the Republican's
set the debate up,

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.410
they say the Democrats

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.640
are for throwing more
money at these problems

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.370
and we know you can't throw money at them.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.480
We just said that.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.880
And we are family values.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.180
Let me tell you something,

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.563
family values won't feed a hungry child,

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.440
but you can't raise

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.173
that hungry child very well without them.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.840
We need both.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.410
Do you really believe that if we permit

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.050
these conditions to go
on for 10, 20 or 30 years

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.610
And we permit national
politics to continue in

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.000
its present relevant track
for 10 or 20 or 30 years,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.960
that America will lead
the world we have made,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.905
that you can keep the American dream alive

00:13:28.905 --> 00:13:31.680
for the next generation of Americans?

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.700
I want my child to grow
up in the America I did,

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.600
I don't want her to be part
of the first generation

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.090
of Americans to do worse
than their parents did.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.720
I don't want her to be
a part of the country

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.070
that's coming apart
instead of coming together.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.760
Over 25 years ago I had a professor

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.610
of Western civilization
who told me our country was

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.290
the greatest country in human history

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:58.090
because our people had always
believed in two simple things,

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.230
one is that the present doesn't have

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.370
to be as good as the future,

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.610
the future can always be better.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.720
And two, that every one of us has

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.720
a personal moral
responsibility to make it so.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.100
That is what the new choice is all about,

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.040
that is what we are
here in Cleveland to do,

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.660
we're not here to save
the Democratic Party,

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.940
we're here to save the
United states of America.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.072
Thank you very much and God bless you.

00:14:27.072 --> 00:14:30.580
(audience applauds)

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.922
- So there was Bill Clinton on

00:14:32.922 --> 00:14:37.922
the cusp of his leadership
role in the Democratic Party

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.840
and he would subsequently
go on to become President.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.820
And so today's agenda is to understand

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.368
this reorientation of
the parties of the left

00:14:49.368 --> 00:14:53.740
and then think about their
place in the broader scheme

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.197
that we are developing as
the course goes a long.

00:14:57.197 --> 00:15:00.148
Our agenda is gonna
have three parts to it,

00:15:00.148 --> 00:15:04.677
I'm gonna start by revisiting
the comments I made about

00:15:04.677 --> 00:15:07.020
distributive politics

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.492
or the psychology of distributive politics

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:13.380
in a little more depth
than I did last time.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.416
And the reason is I've had a
number of questions about it,

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.070
and it's really important.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.440
It's gonna be important
later in the course

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.110
and it's gonna be important
for today's lecture.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.990
So I'm gonna reprise
what I said about that

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.440
and extend it a little bit.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.680
Then we're gonna come to
the heart of the matter

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.820
and talk about unions,
left of center parties

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.820
and the median voter as they
played out in this period.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.795
And then finally we're gonna
talk more generally about

00:15:45.795 --> 00:15:47.810
distributive politics

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.890
in two-party systems such
as Britain and the US,

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:55.890
versus multi-party systems
as prevail in much of Europe.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.750
So let's go back to the comments

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.830
I made about absolute and relative gains.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:10.200
I said to you that absolute
gains are self-referential,

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.160
as in the Ronald Reagan
video that I put up

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.700
saying ask yourself and I better off

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.230
than I was four years ago.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.820
Relative gains are the sorts of things

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.820
that Margaret Thatcher was
lambasting in her speech

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.160
in the House of Commons
when she was saying

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.940
that the left would rather
that the poor will be poorer

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.670
so long as the rich were less rich.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.290
So just for people who like diagrams,

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.640
some people like diagrams and some don't,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.140
and there's nothing I'm
gonna do with a diagram

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.240
that you can't explain without a diagram.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.920
But for those who like diagrams,

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.710
imagine you're gonna ask yourself

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.220
which is better for me from the point

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.640
of view of you representing the red dot.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.640
And we're thinking about my
income on the vertical axis,

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:15.080
and her income on the horizontal axis.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.480
So just to be clear
about what we're saying,

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.480
with absolute gains anything
above that line is better.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.180
I will be better off
than I was four years ago

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.820
if I can move above that line.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.590
When we're talking about relative gains,

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.500
or other referential comparisons,

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.710
then anything to the north-east of that,

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:44.020
to the left side of that blue dotted line,

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:48.100
I will be better off relative to her.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.320
And so we can think about
four quadrants here,

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.880
we can think about up here
I'm better off either way,

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.551
over here I'm worse off either way,

00:17:58.551 --> 00:18:03.040
here I am absolutely better
off but relatively worse off,

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.250
and here I'm relatively better
off and absolutely worse off.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.100
So this is the difference.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.320
Now economists like to think in terms

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.853
of absolute gains because they
think in terms of win-win.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:23.810
So this is a close cousin
of the Pareto principle,

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.046
those that have taken Econ 101 will know,

00:18:27.046 --> 00:18:29.862
if we move from the status quo up here

00:18:29.862 --> 00:18:32.100
both people are better off,

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.300
so that's the realm of
market transactions,

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.608
they'll go there voluntarily.

00:18:36.608 --> 00:18:41.060
If we move from here, maybe to here,

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.480
maybe because the government taxes both

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.490
of us and sends the money to

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:49.576
a country we both despise
then we're worse off.

00:18:49.576 --> 00:18:54.576
And these two quadrants are
where one person gets better off

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.900
and the other person gets worse off.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.315
And much of economic theory

00:19:00.315 --> 00:19:03.780
is about welfare economics is about

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.510
whether and under what
conditions we can say

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.096
that the one who gains gains more or less

00:19:11.096 --> 00:19:13.853
than the one who loses.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.980
So the reason economists tend

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.480
not to like relative comparisons

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.803
is that there's no win-win with relative,

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:30.050
there is no circumstance
with relative comparisons

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.093
where both people can be better off.

00:19:34.377 --> 00:19:39.070
And so I think that's a lot
of the reason for the distaste

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:44.070
for relative comparisons
among neoclassical economists.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:51.010
But, this is not a course
in neoclassical economics

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.320
this is a course about power
and politics in today's world.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.622
And when we think about power and politics

00:19:58.622 --> 00:20:00.730
we have to recognize that

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.837
although economists tend
to prefer absolute gains,

00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:09.630
relative gains are often
much more potent in politics,

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.080
people make relative comparisons

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.060
whether our models tell
us a good idea or not.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.380
But they don't just make
any relative comparisons

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:26.380
and this was the point
about many people not caring

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.460
what multimillionaires make.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.020
Local reference groups,

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.900
people relatively similar to me

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.203
are the sorts of people to
whom I tend to compare myself,

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:42.710
that was the upshot of
the capuchin monkey story

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.558
and why I said that the experimenter

00:20:45.558 --> 00:20:49.893
misinterpreted his own results.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.000
The example I gave is a college professor

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.660
will be much more upset to learn

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.901
that his salary is $10,000 less than

00:20:59.901 --> 00:21:03.430
a similar professor down the hallway

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:07.960
than to learn that it's
half $1 million less

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.483
than the attorney who lives next door.

00:21:12.558 --> 00:21:16.463
So people tend to make
relatively local comparisons.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:22.320
But a corollary of that that
I didn't emphasize enough

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.010
is that these local comparisons

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.473
can be either invidious or solidaristic.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.670
So when we talk about the majority rule,

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.690
divide a dollar game,

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.170
I said if people agree upon

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.095
a conception of fairness for example,

00:21:40.095 --> 00:21:44.790
that everybody should get an
equal share because it's fair,

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.470
that might breed solidarity among them

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:53.470
to vote together if they're
all below the median income.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.140
But the difficulty with that is

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.690
that it's vulnerable to that very logic of

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.400
the divide a dollar game
that I talked about,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.159
namely that you can split
people off of the coalition

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:11.246
by offering them some other benefit,

00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:16.246
unless there is some institution
to actually hold together

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:21.530
and reinforce that solidarity
among a particular group,

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.890
it's gonna be too easy to pick it apart,

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:29.890
and we will in fact see in
four-part harmony on Thursday

00:22:30.899 --> 00:22:35.530
that efforts to pick apart
a distributive coalition

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.890
in accordance with the
divide a dollar game

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.310
when we talk about the anti-tax movement.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:46.500
And so the reason we got
to talking about unions

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.907
was that the thought was that unions

00:22:49.907 --> 00:22:52.161
might be an instrument

00:22:52.161 --> 00:22:55.829
for supplying some if you like

00:22:55.829 --> 00:23:00.240
institutional backbone to the solidarity

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.110
of people below the median income.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.890
And I'm gonna spend a lot
more time on that topic today

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:11.070
when we're thinking about the
reorientation of left parties.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.160
But before I do that I wanted to make

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.510
one more point about the
psychology of distribution

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:22.320
and the way that it plays out in politics.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.963
And I want you to engage with
me in a thought experiment.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:31.016
Let's say that Steve
gets a phone call one day

00:23:31.016 --> 00:23:34.433
and he's told that he's won the lottery.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.063
He's won the lottery and
he's gonna get $2 million.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.890
The next day however,

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.180
he gets a follow-up phone
call and they say well

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:51.170
actually the news is good
but it's not quite that good,

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.070
we didn't know there was a
second ticket that had been sold,

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.120
so actually you're not getting $2 million

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.710
but you're getting $1 million.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.380
Still, it's $1 million

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.053
Steve didn't have $1 million
before he had been called.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.710
Now Art on the other hand,

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.467
he gets a phone call and he says,

00:24:11.467 --> 00:24:13.267
"Art you've won the lottery,

00:24:13.267 --> 00:24:16.100
"you've won half $1
million congratulations."

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.140
And he's delighted.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.727
But the next day he gets
another call and he says,

00:24:21.727 --> 00:24:23.757
"The reason we told you

00:24:23.757 --> 00:24:26.357
"that you had won half $1 million

00:24:26.357 --> 00:24:28.117
"we thought there was another ticket sold

00:24:28.117 --> 00:24:30.737
"but it turns out there
wasn't another ticket sold.

00:24:30.737 --> 00:24:33.557
"So actually Art there
is even better news,

00:24:33.557 --> 00:24:35.403
"You've won $1 million."

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:42.390
Now notice that both Art and Steve

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:46.783
are $1 million richer than
they were two days ago.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.773
But who's happier?

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:52.973
Who's happier?

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.163
Why?

00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:59.323
Pardon?

00:25:01.016 --> 00:25:04.933
(people mutter off microphone)

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.933
Art, you tell us why are you happy?

00:25:14.434 --> 00:25:17.610
Yeah, so what you're all
saying is exactly right,

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:21.023
that Steve somehow thinks
he's lost something.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.020
And this is the concept of loss aversion

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.700
which economists sometime refer to

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.690
as the endowment effect.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.000
This is the idea that

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
if you have something taken away from you

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.880
it bothers you more

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.880
than you become happier if
something is given to you.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:50.660
And this is the idea
for which Danny Kahneman

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.560
won a Nobel prize,

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.150
it should really have gone
to him and Amos Tersky,

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.760
but they don't give it to dead
people and Tersky had died.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.850
And again for people who like
diagrams this is the diagram

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.460
they called it Prospect Theory

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:10.650
and the idea is the curve
is always the shape.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.318
The idea is to capture this notion

00:26:13.318 --> 00:26:18.318
that the prospect of a
gain does not bring as much

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.200
happiness as the prospect
of an equivalent loss

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.873
brings unhappiness.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:28.620
And so this is why

00:26:29.513 --> 00:26:32.582
if you want to motivate people

00:26:32.582 --> 00:26:35.340
to do something

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.210
it's better to talk to
them about undoing a loss

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:40.900
or avoiding a loss

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.363
then the prospect of a gain.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:48.357
So we will come back to this idea

00:26:48.357 --> 00:26:51.383
in the last part of the course

00:26:51.383 --> 00:26:53.650
because I think it has a lot to do

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:57.170
With the psychology behind

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.050
the politics of populism

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.960
that we'll be talking about later.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.840
So this is the notion of loss aversion.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.980
Now some people wonder
about well why is it?

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.700
Because at some level it's irrational

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:15.700
to weigh potential loss more
heavily in terms of futility

00:27:17.087 --> 00:27:20.240
than weighing a potential gain,

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.090
particularly if the things are equivalent,

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.076
the endowment effect idea is

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:26.980
if you own something

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.820
you won't take the price you would take

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.705
if you didn't own it to give it up.

00:27:35.705 --> 00:27:37.170
Again just this idea that it's mine,

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:40.193
I don't want to give
it up is so important.

00:27:41.763 --> 00:27:44.260
And there's speculation about
why people are like this.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:49.240
One of the leading theories is that

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.310
for so long in human history

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.300
people lived so close to the survival

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.210
that even a small loss
might have been catastrophic

00:27:59.102 --> 00:28:00.100
from the point of view of survival

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:04.380
and so people have built in
this idea of avoiding losses

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.893
as being more consequential
than getting gains.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.090
It's one theory,

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.593
there are others.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.790
So we're just keeping all

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.250
that in our analytical bag of tricks

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:23.030
as we work our way through
the rest of today's lecture

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.563
and some of the other
materials in the course.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:33.320
So, the basic challenge
for left of center parties

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.900
in this new world,

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:40.683
is that unions as institutions

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.180
that can reinforce solidaristic
ideals among voters

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.710
below the median income are
becoming less effective.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:52.610
This is the basic challenge.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.080
And the reason is why?

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.053
Because unions are becoming,

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:04.020
unions protect their members

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.780
and are becoming smaller and weaker.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.760
And that means two things,

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.987
they're gonna be less effective

00:29:10.987 --> 00:29:12.560
at protecting their members,

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.480
and the externalities of protecting

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.510
their members when they do,

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:21.290
the spin-offs are gonna be less,

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:22.763
less dissent.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.010
So that's what we are gonna be exploring,

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.713
and I put this picture up last time,

00:29:30.083 --> 00:29:32.430
when we were talking about
the right to make the point

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:35.040
that in the US people think about

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.970
the decline of the unions since the 70s,

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.760
but really the high point

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.450
of union membership in
the American economy

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.780
was in the 1950s,

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.770
and it's been falling ever since.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.500
So the UK is a comparable story,

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.010
just later.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:53.980
You can see here union membership

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:58.660
in Britain peaks at around 1980,

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.950
ironically just as Michael Foot

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.410
is becoming leader of the Labor Party

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:04.260
and we'll have more to say

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.430
about that when we talk
about parties later.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.510
And it's been going down ever since,

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:14.510
so if you look here at
trade union density,

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:19.403
that means the proportion of a sector of

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.823
the economy that is unionized.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:29.100
Since 1995 in the whole
economy that's the blue line,

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.420
it's gone from about 33%

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.630
to about 25%.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.760
And if you look at the private sector,

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.210
which is increasingly important

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.607
because the public sector is shrinking,

00:30:40.607 --> 00:30:45.607
it's gone from above
20% down to about 15%.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:48.730
So not as extreme as story as here,

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:51.495
but nonetheless the size of

00:30:51.495 --> 00:30:55.970
the unionized sectors of the
economy has been falling.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:56.830
Now

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.400
the upshot of this is that unions

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.580
are decreasingly effective institutions

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:10.263
to enforce solidarity
below median income voters.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.853
And this requires quite
a bit of unpacking.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.100
The reason is that where unions remain

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.681
powerful within left of center parties

00:31:24.681 --> 00:31:27.780
they will pull them away
from the median voter.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:32.717
So you saw this for example in
the 1970s and 80s in the UK.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:38.100
Where unions were very powerful
within the Labor Party,

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.340
they controlled the leadership

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.330
selection process for example,

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:47.050
that's how Michael Foot
became leader in 1980.

00:31:49.857 --> 00:31:51.479
And the TUC,

00:31:51.479 --> 00:31:55.940
the trade union organization,

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.010
had, it has less now,

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.530
but it had at that time enormous power

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:04.741
in setting Labor policy.

00:32:04.741 --> 00:32:09.273
But if you think about
union membership declining,

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.602
that means that if they support unions

00:32:13.602 --> 00:32:15.310
they are gonna be pulling

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.890
the Labor Party away from the median voter

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.070
most of whom are not unionized.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:23.140
And indeed one way of
talking about this story

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.937
of British politics in the 1970s and 80s,

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:33.960
certainly until Thatcher
in the late 60s and 70s

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.930
is this divergence of interest.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:39.880
So both Conservative and
Labor governments alike

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.610
used to have things that
they called incomes policies.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.677
And incomes policies
were basically agreements

00:32:46.677 --> 00:32:48.200
that they worked out,

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.270
it sometimes went under

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.960
the name of liberal
corporatism among academics.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.260
You might think liberal corporatism is

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.950
a contradiction in terms,

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:02.690
when we say corporatism we
think of Italian fascism.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.840
The idea of liberal corporatism

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:09.030
was the idea that the government
would negotiate a deal

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:11.720
among business and the unions,

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.780
and then turn it into law and enforce it.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.540
And so the Heath government,

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:17.530
the Wilson,

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.360
Heath was a Conservative,

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.500
the Wilson and Callaghan Labor governments

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.040
were always trying to negotiate

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.630
these incomes policies with the unions.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:30.290
And they would agree that wage increases

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.450
are gonna be capped at 6%.

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.210
And then what they would find was

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:38.327
that the unions say in

00:33:38.327 --> 00:33:41.370
the steel industry or the coal industry

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.740
figure that they could actually negotiate

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.050
a higher settlement with their employers,

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:51.433
and would bust the agreement.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.660
Even under Labor governments,

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.490
Wilson and Callaghan would call in

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:58.330
the union leadership and say,

00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.743
why are you doing this,

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:06.630
you agreed to hold the
line on wage increases,

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.080
as part of our incomes policy.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:15.394
And the answer was we are
here to represent our members,

00:34:15.394 --> 00:34:17.860
we are not here to run
the British economy.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.490
And our first obligation is to our members

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:22.180
and if we are in a position

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:26.940
where we can negotiate
better raises for our members

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.500
why should we not do that?

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.080
They are the ones who pay our dues

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.423
they are the ones who are for us.

00:34:34.934 --> 00:34:38.690
So to the degree that unions
controlled the Labor Party,

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:42.020
they're gonna pull the
interests of the party

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:45.030
in the direction of the unions.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:48.380
And so this was a reason

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:53.380
why we had such hectic politics
in Britain in the 1970s

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.630
many strikes.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:57.310
I lived there in those years,

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:00.016
three day week, garbage in the streets.

00:35:00.016 --> 00:35:02.860
Eventually who governs Britain

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:07.860
became the slogan in the 1979 election,

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.540
which Thatcher won.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.860
Who governs Britain the
unions or the government?

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.520
Governments both Conservative

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:18.873
and Labor had been unable
to govern effectively.

00:35:19.796 --> 00:35:24.796
If you think about another
pretty extreme case,

00:35:25.503 --> 00:35:30.503
in South Africa we have an
extremely powerful union movement

00:35:32.473 --> 00:35:35.184
The reasons for its power will concern

00:35:35.184 --> 00:35:38.110
us in a subsequent lecture,

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:43.110
they trace all the way back to
the transition in the 1970s,

00:35:44.797 --> 00:35:47.560
but it was extremely
powerful union movement

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.430
That is part and parcel of

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:53.280
the governing African
National Congress Alliance.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.870
And so unions protect their members

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:00.097
and so would you have by African standards

00:36:00.097 --> 00:36:05.097
high wages in the formal
sector of the economy

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.937
which is protected by the unions,

00:36:07.937 --> 00:36:11.070
but you have 30% unemployment

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.510
and 50% almost youth unemployment,

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:18.210
third highest in the world
and the rest of the economy.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.650
You have a circumstance in

00:36:20.914 --> 00:36:23.040
which textile jobs are
hemorrhaging to Lesotho,

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.200
and even at one point they
were hemorrhaging to China.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.367
So unions if they can will
protect their members,

00:36:31.367 --> 00:36:34.641
but that may come at
the price of employment

00:36:34.641 --> 00:36:37.813
in the rest of the economy.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.032
At the other end of the continuum,

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:45.180
a system that prevailed in Germany

00:36:46.267 --> 00:36:47.100
particularly in the 1980s.

00:36:51.417 --> 00:36:54.373
And still prevails in some sectors today,

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:57.270
the system in Germany was that

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:01.810
if the unions negotiate
a bargaining agreement

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:06.110
in a particular sector of the economy,

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:10.380
even the non-unionized plants

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.353
or companies would
abide by that agreement.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:18.440
So that's a system where unions,

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.140
the interests of unions and
the interests of all workers,

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.312
become much closer to aligning.

00:37:25.312 --> 00:37:29.050
If even people in the
non-unionized sectors

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:32.077
are getting the same deal as the unions

00:37:32.077 --> 00:37:34.410
the big unions negotiating with

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:38.930
the powerful companies are
negotiating for their members,

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:43.380
then you can see that
unions can function better

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:48.380
as a spine behind the solidaristic

00:37:48.562 --> 00:37:53.220
commitments of voters
below the median incomes.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:58.100
So to the extent that the economy

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.140
is more like the German
economy in the 1980s

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.940
and less like the British
economy in the 1980s

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.400
or the South African economy today,

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.660
unions can in the German kind of case

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.830
be a source of policy

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:19.370
that's gonna be appealing
to the median voter,

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:24.370
or more likely to be
appealing to the median voter.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:28.170
And so one of the things

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.510
that we have to think our way through

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:34.880
is that without reinforcing institutions

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.130
solidaristic ideals among people below

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:41.823
the median voter will
be very hard to sustain.

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:50.030
So this leads to the logic

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.000
of what we call sometimes triangulation.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.713
So just to give you a
couple of examples here.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.810
- They're a new generation of Democrats,

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.300
Bill Clinton and Al Gore.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.010
And they don't think the way
the old Democratic Party did,

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:09.130
they've called for an end
to welfare as we know it,

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:12.440
so welfare can be a second
chance, not a way of life.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.210
They have sent a strong
signal to criminals

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:15.920
by supporting the death penalty,

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.620
and they rejected the old
tax and spend policies.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.980
Clinton has balanced 12
budgets and they have proposed

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.820
a new plan investing in
people detailing $140 billion

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.140
in spending cuts they
would make right now.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.973
Clinton Gore, for people, for a change.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.910
- So there you see

00:39:36.531 --> 00:39:40.653
the Clinton campaign moving
very far to the right.

00:39:42.406 --> 00:39:46.360
To capture the middle ground

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.780
because they no longer
think that they can get

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.760
the solidaristic support
of people on the left.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.880
And indeed,

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.870
Clinton felt that he actually had

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:59.120
to attack the left of the Democratic Party

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.400
to get his bona fides as someone

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.105
who could one in this new world.

00:40:06.105 --> 00:40:09.400
And this is his famous
speech about Sista Souljah.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.400
- You had a rap singer here
last night named Sista Souljah,

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.767
I defend her right to
express herself through music

00:40:17.767 --> 00:40:21.020
but her comments before
and after Los Angeles

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.100
were filled with a kind of hatred

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.760
that you do not honor today and tonight.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.423
Just listen to this, what she said.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.800
She told the Washington Post
about a month ago, and I quote,

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.970
if black people kill
black people every day,

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.670
why not have a week and kill white people.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.510
So you're a gang member and
you normally kill somebody,

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:45.503
why not kill a white person?

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.450
Last year she said you can't call me

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:51.140
or any black person anywhere
in the world a racist,

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:53.070
we don't have the power
to do to white people

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:55.160
what white people have done to us,

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.030
and even if we did,

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:58.820
we don't have that low-down dirty nature.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.880
If they are any good white
people, I haven't met them,

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.920
where are they?

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.894
Right here in this room.

00:41:03.894 --> 00:41:04.727
(audience applauds)

00:41:04.727 --> 00:41:05.670
That's where they are.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.320
I know she is a young person

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:13.310
but she has a big influence
on a lot of people.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:14.400
And when people say that,

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.010
if you took the words white
and black and you reversed them

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:19.510
you might think David Duke
was giving that speech.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:27.340
- So that was very dishonest
in its presentation,

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.950
because she had not actually said that,

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:34.950
she had talked about a
rap singer singing that.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:36.690
It wasn't her music,

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:40.070
she was talking about a rap
song that made those claims

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.990
and was talking about the claim.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.550
She wasn't herself taking those views.

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:45.893
But it didn't matter,

00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:49.630
this went viral,

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:54.183
or the 1992 equivalent of viral.

00:41:55.489 --> 00:41:58.490
Because it was Clinton distancing himself

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:03.000
from the African-American
affirmative active agenda

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.650
as it was portrayed by his critics

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:10.090
as a way to try and move to the center.

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:11.950
And so the thought here is,

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:15.090
the motivating thought
is in a two-party system

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.453
if you move to the middle,

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:24.650
the people on your flank
have no place to go.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:29.850
So when Trump was running in 2016

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:32.870
and he said to African-Americans,

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:35.310
vote for me, what have you got to lose?

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:39.320
He was exactly saying that they don't get

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.140
any attention on the left
of the Democratic Party,

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.290
so the Democratic Party can take them

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.323
for granted and ignored them.

00:42:48.327 --> 00:42:51.040
And so this becomes the argument for

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.610
the politics of triangulation,

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.320
which I'll have more to
say about on Thursday.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.450
But the idea is that
you move to the middle

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:03.427
to peel off support from the other side,

00:43:03.427 --> 00:43:06.363
and enough support to win.

00:43:07.447 --> 00:43:09.010
And you might depress turnout

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:11.170
a little bit on the left of your own party

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:13.480
if you're a Democrat who is triangulating,

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:17.550
but at the end of the day
they have no place to go,

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:21.100
and so it seems like a winning strategy.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.930
And so this idea of triangulation

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:28.930
that was dreamt up by people
like James Carville and others

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:31.640
and very much also

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.610
informed Tony Blair's approach in Britain.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.720
So there the race issue is not salient

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.090
in the way it is here,

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:41.770
but as you saw when he was talking at

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:45.330
the 1995 Labor Party Conference,

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:49.780
he said, we are not gonna
undo the Thatcher changes

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.240
to labor laws and in fact

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:55.260
he did not undo the
Thatcher privatizations,

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:59.280
actually they went into
additional privatizations,

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.730
and the did not bring back regulation.

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:04.810
And indeed, part of the bitterness

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:07.790
against Blair on the
left of the Labor Party

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:10.190
would turn out to be that they thought

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:13.620
he was more Thatcherite than Thatcher.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.120
And so if you have this situation

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:20.490
where the traditional source of solidarity

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.630
on the left of a left party

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:25.390
has now dissipated because of unions

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:27.570
are too weak to supply it,

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.870
or they are too segmented in their agenda

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:32.888
is that they are gonna follow.

00:44:32.888 --> 00:44:35.870
The path of least resistance from

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:38.320
the point of view of getting elected

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.150
would be to move to the center,

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:47.730
try and peel off support
from the other side,

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:52.730
and know that the people who
are on the left of your party

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.680
might be angry, but at the end of the day,

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.513
they have no place to go.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:04.110
So that is in a nutshell the story

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:06.520
about why in two-party systems

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:10.720
we saw this logic of triangulation

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:15.073
most dramatically with
Clinton and Tony Blair.

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:20.890
And you can understand why the
desire to win on the actions

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:23.480
would drive politicians to do that.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.020
But what about multi-party systems?

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:30.630
Multi-party systems are different
in their basic functioning

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:32.993
and in their basic logic.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.140
So the conventional wisdom

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.100
about multi-party
systems is the following.

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.732
Multi-party systems,

00:45:42.732 --> 00:45:46.810
people like them, they say
they are more representative.

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:50.430
They are more representative
because in a two-party system

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:53.280
we see the parties are
heading for the median voter.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.040
But what if you're not the median voter,

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.930
you feel unrepresented.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:46:00.143
So in a multi-party system,

00:46:00.143 --> 00:46:04.751
the Greens have their
people in parliament,

00:46:04.751 --> 00:46:07.870
the anti-immigrant crowd have
their people in parliament,

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:10.350
the Free Democrats in Germany,

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:14.490
the libertarian people have
their people in parliament.

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:16.710
Everybody has a seat at the table,

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:20.730
and so that seems much more representative

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:23.080
how many people think
it's more representative?

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:27.653
How many people think it's not?

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:32.120
So the more representative
have it for the moment.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.470
This is a topic we're gonna revisit

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:38.210
in considerable depth later in the course.

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:40.880
Because the argument on the other side is

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.020
it's more representative
at the electoral stage,

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.060
but that doesn't mean

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.340
it's more representative
at the governing stage

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.120
when governments have to be formed

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.490
and coalition governments
have to be put together.

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:57.140
So we'll come back to that whole subject.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:01.214
But for a long time the
conventional wisdom was that,

00:47:01.214 --> 00:47:04.603
it's put up here, Bingham Powell's book,

00:47:05.505 --> 00:47:07.700
"Elections as Instruments of Democracy".

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:12.700
But the conventional wisdom
was that multi-party systems

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.460
over time the produce policies

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:21.520
that are more responsive
to the median voter,

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.060
and that therefore they
are more distributive.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:26.823
So if we go back to what
we were talking about,

00:47:26.823 --> 00:47:29.750
the median voter theorem
a couple of lectures ago,

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:32.770
the claim was, and the evidence seemed

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:35.050
to support the proposition that

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:37.850
multi-party systems
are more redistributive

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:41.770
because of what you would expect

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.945
if you think that the people
below the median voter

00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:48.670
would want more redistribution.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:52.300
As you can see, Bingham Powell's

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.650
book was published in 2000.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:59.650
And that means that most of his data

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.560
is at least several decades old now,

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.580
it's all from the last century.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:09.580
But this picture of inequality
that I showed you a while ago

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.373
captures that intuition
and that inequality went,

00:48:15.422 --> 00:48:17.740
this is the gilded age, this is today,

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:20.315
we all know about the U-shaped curve

00:48:20.315 --> 00:48:24.540
that we went to much less inequality in

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.290
the middle part of the century,

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:29.540
and then since the 1970s
it's been climbing.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.913
But then if you look by national,

00:48:33.177 --> 00:48:36.000
by country you can see that

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
the U-shaped curve is
flat in Germany and France

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:44.260
than in the US and in the UK.

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:48.550
So that's consistent with the suggestion

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:52.310
that these systems are less inegalitarian,

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:55.990
or less susceptible to
inegalitarian outcomes

00:48:55.990 --> 00:49:00.913
then the two-party systems
like Britain and the US.

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:03.980
Of course for me to say

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:09.930
that this graph supports
that idea would be to commit

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:11.990
to selecting on a dependent variable

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:13.490
that I was talking about last time,

00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:15.730
so I'm not making a causal argument here.

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:17.529
But this is just describing

00:49:17.529 --> 00:49:20.130
what was the conventional wisdom.

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:23.610
And that's indeed why
many people on the left

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:26.090
prefer the European systems,

00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:29.540
they think that they are more
likely to be egalitarian,

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:32.483
more likely to be redistributive.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.760
So is it the case?

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:43.530
And the thing that we have to
start thinking about is that,

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:47.630
Unions have also been
declining in those systems.

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:50.040
Now why might that matter?

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.460
I put up a lot of graphs that
would be too small to see,

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:59.460
but basically you can see
them when I post them.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:04.530
In virtually every single
major European economy

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:06.960
union membership has been declining

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.050
in the last several decades,

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:14.050
just as it has been declining
in Britain and the US.

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.650
Some at different rates.

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:17.100
There are a couple of outliers,

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:19.043
I mentioned Finland.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.610
Even in Finland in the last five years,

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:28.010
union membership has fallen by 5%.

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.040
And another outlier is Iceland,

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:34.360
Iceland is a very tiny economy

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.840
and it's not exactly clear

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.770
why they have such high
rates of unionization,

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:42.437
but even in Iceland there's been a kind of

00:50:42.437 --> 00:50:46.190
backlash in one of the biggest unions just

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:47.430
in the last couple of years,

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:51.540
actually there's been a insurgency

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.610
to take over control of the union

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:56.040
because they feel it's too
much of a company union,

00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:01.040
too close to the interests
of the company's.

00:51:03.064 --> 00:51:08.064
So in any case, Iceland
and Finland to one side,

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.630
there's decline of unions everywhere

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:13.310
for the reasons that
we've talked about before.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:16.732
Namely, globalization of capital,

00:51:16.732 --> 00:51:20.550
that makes it easier for
capital to move around.

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:22.440
The exit costs for capital are low,

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.970
the exit costs for labor are high,

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:27.690
the Hershman story.

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:29.363
And of course increasing,

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:35.540
increasing jobs going to technology,

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.720
that indeed may be more important

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.323
than globalization going forward.

00:51:42.293 --> 00:51:43.730
A McDonald's restaurant that used

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:45.420
to have 20 people working in it

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.183
that you now see eight
people working in it,

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:52.590
five or eight years from now
may have one person working in

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.523
watching a robot making burgers.

00:51:57.562 --> 00:51:58.890
So we've seen this long term decline

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:00.700
of union membership that's

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:05.140
been going on everywhere pretty much.

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:07.150
And that has two implications

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:11.163
that I want to now dig
into a little more deeply.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:17.900
The one implication is
that left of center parties

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:22.313
are gonna be less effective in
protecting employed workers.

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.270
So why might this be the case?

00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:28.400
I said unions protect their members.

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:33.400
But the fewer members
there are in an industry

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:39.400
the less leverage the union
has in negotiating settlements.

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.585
You see this is going on right now,

00:52:41.585 --> 00:52:44.440
this isn't in a multi-party system,

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:48.210
but you see this right
now going on in Detroit.

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:49.750
Why are those workers on strike,

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:52.487
they are on strike or
threatening to go on strike

00:52:52.487 --> 00:52:57.487
because the GM cannot compete with

00:53:01.624 --> 00:53:05.340
the foreign car makers working
in southern states of the US,

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.190
the so-called right to work states

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:10.610
that are not unionized that
are paying 30 bucks an hour,

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:15.610
whereas the union agreement
is more like 40 bucks an hour.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:20.360
So these unions are less powerful

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.110
in negotiating with employers,

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:27.110
GM could choose not to produce
electric cars in Detroit

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:29.750
and start producing them elsewhere.

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:32.020
And so you would expect unions

00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:37.020
would be less able to
negotiate strong deals.

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:40.310
Whether or not it's part of
the corporatist arrangement

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:43.120
subsequently enforced by the government.

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:48.120
So Germany, I said Germany was in the 80s

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:52.988
was the heyday of what
political economists

00:53:52.988 --> 00:53:54.940
were calling liberal corporatism,

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:59.180
these big deals done between
the big unions and big business

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.040
and governments would get behind them.

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.093
But in the early part of this century,

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:08.010
interestingly when Gerhard Schroder

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:11.065
as the last social Democratic chancellor

00:54:11.065 --> 00:54:14.320
was in a governing alliance with who?

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.259
The Greens.

00:54:16.259 --> 00:54:19.200
Not a grand alliance with the CDU,

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.723
but with the Green party.

00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:24.980
They implemented the
so-called Hartz reforms,

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.970
and the Hartz reforms
were not that different

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:32.270
from what was done by
New Labour in the UK,

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:34.479
and not that different from

00:54:34.479 --> 00:54:39.479
what was done under the
Democrats in the US.

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:42.831
The new Democrats under the US,

00:54:42.831 --> 00:54:44.620
there were market friendly reforms

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.760
designed to reduce unemployment,

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.830
to protect unemployment,

00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:54.010
reduce unemployment rather
than protect workers wages.

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:56.130
More market flexibility.

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:59.280
Hartz, the author of the Hartz reforms

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:03.390
had been head of Volkswagen,

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:05.560
eventually actually resigned in disgrace

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.450
a couple of years later
for unrelated reasons,

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:11.880
but he had designed these
very business friendly reforms

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.810
that were implemented
over the first few years.

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:17.060
There were four stages of them.

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:22.060
In Germany their form
of moving to the middle,

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:26.800
so that the Social Democrats even

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:31.240
when their only alliance
partner was the Greens

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.630
couldn't resist this tide.

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.890
They were no longer in a position

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:40.700
to force more generous settlements

00:55:42.284 --> 00:55:45.348
to their workers

00:55:45.348 --> 00:55:48.153
as they had been in the past.

00:55:51.703 --> 00:55:52.536
And by the way,

00:55:52.536 --> 00:55:54.940
even though Schroder

00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:59.850
implemented the Hartz reforms,

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:04.010
it still didn't stop him
from losing to Angela Merkel

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:06.500
in the 2005 election,

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:10.133
and she's been Chancellor
of Germany ever since.

00:56:12.381 --> 00:56:16.080
So the move to the center,

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.950
even in a multi-party system
with a labor oriented party

00:56:21.103 --> 00:56:25.540
was in the driver's seat of the government

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:30.270
was unable to do any better

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:33.123
because of the declining
power of the unions.

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.900
And the other implication is that to

00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:41.930
the extent you can
protect unionized workers,

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:45.750
that may impose costs on
others below the median income.

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.440
Service sector workers

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.596
who were notoriously difficult to organize

00:56:50.596 --> 00:56:52.830
even though these economies are

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:55.957
all increasingly becoming
service second economies,

00:56:55.957 --> 00:56:58.920
and the long-term unemployed.

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.020
Because if you think about the union

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.350
it's going to protect the
short-term unemployed,

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:05.260
namely their members

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:07.170
who might recently have become unemployed

00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:09.610
and might be going back
into the workforce,

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:11.190
but they don't have an interest

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:13.910
in protecting the long-term unemployed.

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:17.440
On the contrary, there may be a trade-off

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:21.470
between creating employment
for the long-term unemployed

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:26.190
and protecting the wages
of unionized workers.

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:31.190
So it's not surprising that
even in multi-party systems

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:37.890
you might think that unionized workers

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:41.720
as represented by traditional
left of center parties

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:44.420
Are going to be less well protected

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:49.259
and less effective as
instruments of solidarity

00:57:49.259 --> 00:57:54.259
Among others whose income
is below the median voter.

00:58:01.226 --> 00:58:03.180
So, how might this play out
in a multi-party system?

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:05.363
In a two-party system as I've said,

00:58:06.415 --> 00:58:10.280
the path of least resistance
is to head for the middle

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:14.295
and let the people on the
flanks of your party stew.

00:58:14.295 --> 00:58:16.340
Multi-party systems are different

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:20.360
because there are plenty of
people to form coalitions with.

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.003
And so this is,

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.100
I should say that the slides
that I'm gonna show you now

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:31.750
are very much from work
in progress that I'm doing

00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:36.750
with Francis Rosenberg
and some economists,

00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:37.803
postdocs,

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:41.737
that is somewhat tentative but

00:58:41.737 --> 00:58:45.770
there are some pretty dramatic conclusions

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:48.123
I think on some matters.

00:58:49.414 --> 00:58:54.414
So you can see on here,
this is from 1960 to 2020.

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:59.480
26 OECD countries,

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:04.410
the vast majority of
them multi-party systems.

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:08.160
The number of parties
represented in the legislature,

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.490
the number of parties differs from

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:11.770
the number of different
effective partners,

00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:15.620
only in that effective parties
weight them by their size.

00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:17.400
But what you can see is the number

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.360
of parties in the legislature has gone up.

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:25.243
We see fragmentation of political parties.

00:59:25.243 --> 00:59:28.610
And if you look at the left parties

00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:31.410
in these 26 OECD countries,

00:59:31.410 --> 00:59:35.030
what you can see is that
while the voting share,

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:38.523
which is the black line
is pretty much flat,

00:59:38.523 --> 00:59:41.203
it's gone down a little bit since 2010.

00:59:44.003 --> 00:59:48.273
The number of parties
has gone up dramatically.

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.433
Why might that be?

00:59:54.596 --> 00:59:58.290
Why might we think, given what
I've been talking about here,

00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:00.990
why would one think that

01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:03.750
we would start to see more parties,

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:05.360
fragmentation just means more parties?

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.370
Yeah, you're gonna have to yell,

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.150
we forgot to get the microphone today.

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:09.919
You'll have to scream.

01:00:09.919 --> 01:00:11.411
- [Man] If you move to the center

01:00:11.411 --> 01:00:14.087
then somebody can move to the
left and take your left flank?

01:00:14.087 --> 01:00:17.050
- Bingo, that's exactly right.

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:19.343
So just to give an example,

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:25.540
the Social Democrats moved
somewhat to the center.

01:00:27.818 --> 01:00:29.160
And alienated people on their left

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.160
and those people then were up
for grabs by other parties.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:37.173
It's not the case that
they have no place to go.

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:43.110
And so one possible cause of this

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.250
is just another way of saying,

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:49.720
what was said at the back of the room,

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:54.220
that as industrial jobs have gone down.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.550
We can see here industrial jobs falling

01:00:56.550 --> 01:01:00.680
over this period quite dramatically,

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.670
the number of parties has gone up.

01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:06.550
And so as these parties become weaker

01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:09.400
and represent fewer workers

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.211
and therefore move in search
of new coalition partners,

01:01:14.211 --> 01:01:16.540
other parties are gonna emerge

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.670
because they can get some seats

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:22.450
and they can get a place
in the legislature.

01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:24.010
And it's interesting that if you look

01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:26.800
at fragmentation of right-wing parties

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.840
there's no systematic shape,
at least not since 1990s.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.400
If you try to draw a line through

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.643
that it would be pretty much flat.

01:01:36.531 --> 01:01:39.350
So it's really more
fragmentation on the left.

01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:41.043
And if you look here,

01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:47.040
where has the SPD's vote gone to?

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.563
It's gone all over the place.

01:01:50.584 --> 01:01:51.417
So this is comparing,

01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:56.040
this is the 2013 election,
the 2017 election in Germany.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.770
And you can see they have lost votes

01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:59.960
to the Alternative for Deutschland,

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.120
they've lost votes to

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.480
the Free Democrats, they've
lost votes to the Greens,

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.824
and they've also lost votes to people

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:11.273
who stopped voting down here.

01:02:12.654 --> 01:02:17.654
So as the effects of the
Hartz reforms and this move

01:02:17.724 --> 01:02:22.724
in the neoliberal direction
in the SPD has accelerated,

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:25.620
by 2013,

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.210
by the way they were in

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:31.400
a governing grand coalition with the CDU.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.360
So it was a very different
kind of government.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:39.360
And many of their traditional
supporters indeed thought

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.343
that they had been selling out,

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.950
giving away too much to
Merkel to be in the coalition.

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:49.300
And as I said to you in the
very first lecture of the class,

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.610
that in 2017 when they got hammered,

01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:55.540
they said we're not going back
into another grand coalition

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:59.390
because all we do is erode our base

01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:01.209
because of the agreements we have to make

01:03:01.209 --> 01:03:03.360
to be in a grand coalition

01:03:05.354 --> 01:03:07.450
with the CDU.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:10.561
And it was only after
seven months of Merkel

01:03:10.561 --> 01:03:13.484
failing to make other
coalition arrangements

01:03:13.484 --> 01:03:18.484
while the AFD was increasing
its popularity in the polls,

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.869
frightening everybody at the
prospect of another election

01:03:23.869 --> 01:03:28.869
that the SPD finally went
back into a grand coalition.

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.090
It didn't help by the way,

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:34.160
I mentioned to you in that lecture

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.120
that the following year
in the regional elections

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.370
in Hesse and Bavaria

01:03:41.087 --> 01:03:44.410
that both the SPD and

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:47.900
the CDU continued hemorrhaging support.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:50.640
Mostly the SPD to the Greens

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.780
and mostly the CDU to the
Alternative for Deutschland.

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:56.000
Since then we've had local elections

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.088
where the AFD has again cleaned up.

01:03:59.088 --> 01:04:04.088
So that is not gonna abate any time soon.

01:04:06.502 --> 01:04:09.810
So just again to,

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:11.730
I don't want to talk about a lot of this

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:14.560
but this again preliminary results.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:19.560
One of the things you see
in that circle is that

01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:25.110
what might be,

01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.620
again this is not causally established,

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:31.210
but what we're observing in this data.

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:33.620
What might be the case that

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.950
when left governments are in power

01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:38.820
as part of coalitions,

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.570
unemployment actually has not gone up

01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:46.570
in these 26 OECD countries
by about a percent.

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:51.616
So again, this is not a causal argument,

01:04:51.616 --> 01:04:53.520
but it's consistent with the thought

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.520
that these left parties
are less able to protect

01:04:59.257 --> 01:05:04.222
the people below the median voter.

01:05:04.222 --> 01:05:09.222
That they're protecting a
shrinking labor aristocracy

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.440
less and less effectively

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.710
and with fewer and
fewer positive spin-offs

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:18.120
for people around and close to them

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.530
in the income distribution.

01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:25.530
So the upshot of this is that
unions in multi-party systems

01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.570
are protecting shrinking
groups of industrial workers

01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:33.943
less well than they used to do.

01:05:37.442 --> 01:05:42.430
And party fragmentation
makes solidaristic ideologies

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:44.800
among voters below the median voter

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.780
more difficult to sustain.

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:50.510
And this is why we see
the hemorrhaging of all

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:54.238
of these voters on the
slide I put up earlier.

01:05:54.238 --> 01:05:57.930
So just to finish out the German story,

01:05:57.930 --> 01:05:59.400
what happens is that

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:06.820
as the SPD starts to lose voters,

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:11.640
Merkel thinks oh, I could
pick up some of these voters,

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:15.540
so she also moved toward the middle.

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.010
That then opened up space on her flank for

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:23.180
the emergence of the Alternative
for Deutschland party,

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:26.980
and so to some extent
fragmentation on the left

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:31.483
will produce fragmentation on
the right in response to that.

01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:34.609
And make it more difficult

01:06:37.073 --> 01:06:39.502
for parties on the right also

01:06:39.502 --> 01:06:43.090
to form predictable compilations.

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:46.910
And so the sorts of
outcomes we have been seeing

01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:48.530
in European elections in

01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:51.470
the last few years are
not that surprising.

01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:54.200
Namely you get inconclusive results

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.713
in many of these elections,

01:06:57.204 --> 01:06:59.650
or you get situations

01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:03.133
where you need three or four
parties to form a government.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.830
And the traditional in Germany

01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:08.540
since we we're talking about Germany,

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.560
traditionally in Germany
the two biggest parties

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.920
were the CDU and the SPD,

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.913
and they were,

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.110
it wasn't that different
from a two-party system,

01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:20.327
it was very predictable

01:07:20.327 --> 01:07:24.120
that they were gonna dominate center-left

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.730
and then center right,
and then center-left

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:28.380
were gonna dominate coalitions over time,

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:33.380
so they operated more or
less like two-party systems.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:36.740
Now all bets are off as to

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:40.290
who will be in that coalition next time.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:44.440
Mostly because of the decline
of center-left parties.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:48.000
And you can look in country
after country after country

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.290
where the left of center
party traditionally

01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:52.553
always would come in first or second.

01:07:54.847 --> 01:07:56.070
It doesn't matter if it's Germany,

01:07:56.070 --> 01:07:58.260
it doesn't matter if it's Holland,

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.130
it doesn't matter if it's Israel.

01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:02.870
The Labor Party in Israel
always came in first or second.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:05.170
Now these parties come in fourth or fifth

01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:09.100
reflecting their much weakened state

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:14.100
as representatives of organized
labor within the electorate.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.275
So party fragmentation means

01:08:19.275 --> 01:08:22.060
that to the extent unions
and the political parties

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:24.618
that are answerable to unions

01:08:24.618 --> 01:08:28.500
are sources of solidarity

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:31.883
of voters below the median voter,

01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:35.750
that has really gone away.

01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:39.830
And that means that even though it's

01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:43.720
a sort of commonly repeated mantra

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.860
that PR systems are more redistributive,

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:49.692
PR systems are more responsive
to the median voter,

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:52.470
the truth in today's world

01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:54.950
is that PR systems are simply vastly

01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.420
less predictable than they used to be,

01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:00.340
because of the proliferation of parties,

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:04.530
nobody has any idea who is
gonna be forming the government.

01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:05.783
And sometimes,

01:09:06.930 --> 01:09:09.940
so we have a grand coalition
in Germany right now,

01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:12.350
but it could be parties
from the two extremes

01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:16.470
as happened in the
Greek elections of 2015.

01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:19.100
When you have a far left Populist party

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:23.710
making a coalition with the
far right populist party.

01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:27.378
What they shared in common was
their antipathy for Europe,

01:09:27.378 --> 01:09:31.157
but very different alternatives

01:09:31.157 --> 01:09:35.300
to your membership being envisaged

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.900
by them if they will actually in

01:09:37.839 --> 01:09:40.410
the position to implement their policies.

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:43.810
So the traditional advantages of PR,

01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:47.000
which produces multi-party systems

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.483
seems very much in question.

01:09:51.066 --> 01:09:56.066
So the last implication of this discussion

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.810
is that the proliferation

01:09:57.810 --> 01:10:02.810
of far right parties in
these systems is worrying,

01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:05.350
we talked about this in
the very first lecture,

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:08.460
but at the end of the day
it's not that surprising

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:10.570
because it's been driven by

01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:13.110
the logic of competitive politics

01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:18.110
in this new world that has
emerged since the Cold War.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:23.500
Next we will talk about
shifting the goalposts,

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.910
the anti-tax movement
in the United States.

01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:28.233
See you on Thursday.

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.644
(gentle music)

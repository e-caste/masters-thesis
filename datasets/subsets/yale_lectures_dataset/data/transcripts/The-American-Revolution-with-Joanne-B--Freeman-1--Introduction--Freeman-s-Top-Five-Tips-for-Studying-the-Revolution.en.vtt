00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.401
Prof: Now,
I'm looking out at all of these

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:09.240
faces and I'm assuming that many
of you have probably arrived

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.632
here with some preconceived
notions about the American

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:13.720
Revolution.
 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.271
I'm assuming that at least some
of you are sitting there and in

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:17.960
the back of your mind you're
thinking--

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.560
Declaration of Independence,
a bunch of battles,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.833
George Washington,
a little bit of Paul Revere

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:25.830
thrown in--
and all of those things are

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.032
going to appear in the course
but obviously the real American

00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:35.020
Revolution is a lot more complex
than that.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.690
It's more than a string of
names and documents and battles,

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.407
and as a matter of fact in many
ways the American Revolution

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:41.420
wasn't just a war.
 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.410
If you went back to the
mid-eighteenth century,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.591
went back to the period of the
Revolution or maybe just after

00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:50.198
it,
and you asked people how they

00:00:50.198 --> 00:00:53.048
understood what was happening,
many of them would tell you

00:00:53.048 --> 00:00:56.352
that the war was actually only a
minor part of the American

00:00:56.352 --> 00:00:57.150
Revolution.
 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.316
Some would tell you the war
actually wasn't the American

00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:02.619
Revolution at all and you'll see
the--

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:05.995
I should mention that the
syllabus is finally up online so

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:08.726
it's there for you,
but you will see when you look

00:01:08.726 --> 00:01:11.769
at the syllabus that at the very
start of it there are two quotes

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:14.430
and I want to read them here
because they make this point

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.239
really well.
 

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:18.423
So the first quote is from a
letter by John Adams and he's

00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:21.662
writing to Thomas Jefferson in
1815 and he's heard about an

00:01:21.662 --> 00:01:25.123
attempt to write the history of
the American Revolution so this

00:01:25.123 --> 00:01:27.470
is what Adams has to say about
that.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.486
"As to the history of the
Revolution, my ideas may be

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:35.221
peculiar, perhaps singular,
but what do we mean by the

00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:36.280
Revolution?
 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.269
The war?
 

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:39.080
That was no part of the
Revolution."

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.200
There is the moment where you
go "Huh?"

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.300
"It was only an effect and
consequence of it.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.830
The Revolution was in the minds
of the people,

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.629
and this was effected from 1760
to 1775,

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:56.291
in the course of fifteen years
before a drop of blood was drawn

00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:57.870
at Lexington."
 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.170
Okay.
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.715
So there we have John Adams
saying that the war was actually

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:03.459
no part of the Revolution.
 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.242
It's a pretty famous quote but
it's a pretty interesting

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:06.849
statement.
 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.091
Now I want to mention here,
and it's very early in the

00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:11.756
course for me to have worked you
in to liking John Adams and I'm

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:14.210
going to talk more about John
Adams in a few minutes,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.140
but I will mention here since
I've just read that quote if

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.554
partway through the semester you
decide you're just dying to read

00:02:22.554 --> 00:02:25.329
dead people's mail,
which is basically what

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.050
historians do for a living,
a great volume to read is

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.879
actually the letters that
Jefferson and Adams sent back

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.919
and forth to each other over the
course of their lives.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.539
They've all been pulled
together into one volume and the

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.780
best part of that volume is the
end section,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.440
the letters in which these guys
were writing to each other in

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.150
their old age.
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.111
So you have these two Founder
figures, former presidents,

00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:48.340
and they're just basically
letting it rip in these letters.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.430
They're talking about
everything.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.628
They're talking about all the
things actually you probably

00:02:51.628 --> 00:02:53.250
wouldn't talk about normally:
religion,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.410
politics, who they hate,
who they like,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.270
what they thought of the
Revolution,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.240
what they thought of their own
presidency,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.990
what they thought of the other
guy's presidency,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.938
the top ten Founder funerals.
 

00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:06.120
Actually, there's a little
section,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.348
although I think it's the top
three Founder funerals,

00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:10.431
but it's a weird,
really interesting range of

00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:13.269
stuff and it's just these two
people really excited about the

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.153
fact that they've retired and
all they need to do now is write

00:03:16.153 --> 00:03:19.039
to each other and really get to
know each other better.

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.979
So it's a great volume.
 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.560
It's edited by Lester Cappon.
 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.955
The last name is C-a-p-p-o-n if
you're interested.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:26.438
Okay.
 

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:29.406
So that quote I just read you
is actually from that series of

00:03:29.406 --> 00:03:31.978
letters, Adams saying that the
war was no part of the

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:32.720
Revolution.
 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.822
Adams does say,
"Well, maybe my ideas are

00:03:34.822 --> 00:03:37.251
a little bit peculiar"
but he's not the only one

00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:38.840
spouting that kind of thought.
 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.437
So here is Benjamin Rush,
who I guess in a way you could

00:03:42.437 --> 00:03:44.400
say was doctor to the stars.
 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.735
He was actually this renowned
doctor from the revolutionary

00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:50.955
and early national period and he
had a lot of high-placed

00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:52.220
political friends.
 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.742
So here's Benjamin Rush writing
in 1787: "There is nothing

00:03:57.742 --> 00:04:03.445
more common than to confound the
terms of the American Revolution

00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:07.008
with those of the late American
war.

00:04:07.008 --> 00:04:09.848
The American war is over but
this is far from being the case

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:11.340
with the American Revolution.
 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.302
On the contrary,
nothing but the first act of

00:04:14.302 --> 00:04:16.660
this great drama is
closed."

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.261
So there you have Benjamin Rush
saying that boy,

00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.329
this is a common problem.
 

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:25.665
A lot of people mix up American
Revolution with American war and

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.889
they're not just one and the
same thing.

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:28.980
The war is over.
 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.500
The Revolution goes on,
and Rush is saying this even as

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.480
late as 1787.
 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.252
It's four years after the
treaty that ended the war,

00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:38.538
we're heading in to
Constitution territory,

00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:41.040
and to Rush,
the Revolution is continuing.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.620
So what do these people mean?
 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.826
Well, in part,
they are expressing part of

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:50.190
what this class is going to be
exploring.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.088
They're basically suggesting
that the American Revolution

00:04:54.088 --> 00:04:58.055
represented an enormous change
of mindset as loyal British

00:04:58.055 --> 00:05:00.517
colonists--
right?--long-standing loyal

00:05:00.517 --> 00:05:04.038
British colonists,
were transformed gradually into

00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:08.259
angry revolutionaries and
ultimately into Americans.

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.382
Like John Adams suggests,
the beginnings of this

00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:14.439
transformation predate the
actual fighting,

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.127
and like Benjamin Rush
suggests, it doesn't just come

00:05:17.127 --> 00:05:19.300
to a close when you sign a peace
treaty.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.769
So when you look at things from
this broad view,

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:27.334
the Revolution actually becomes
the beginning of a period in

00:05:27.334 --> 00:05:30.778
which the American nation was
really inventing itself,

00:05:30.778 --> 00:05:33.629
and this is a really dramatic
kind of invention.

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.930
You have--In a sense we're just
little pipsqueaks at this point,

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.492
and so you have these little
pipsqueaks and they are actually

00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:41.879
saying,
"Okay. We reject monarchy.

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.519
We're going to turn towards a
democratic republic."

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:45.654
They're saying,
"Yeah.

00:05:45.654 --> 00:05:48.449
Well, we know the power's been
at the imperial center forever.

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.593
We're going to turn our backs
on that and pull power in to

00:05:51.593 --> 00:05:54.850
what's basically the margins of
the British empire."

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.702
They're turning away from an
assumption that the few are in

00:05:57.702 --> 00:06:00.547
power and they're saying,
"Well, what if we try

00:06:00.547 --> 00:06:02.410
putting the many in power?"
 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.271
Those are pretty dramatic
changes and they aren't of

00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:06.730
course the only changes.
 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.043
People--Colonists began to
think about themselves

00:06:10.043 --> 00:06:11.009
differently.
 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.036
It's really easy to
underestimate the degree to

00:06:14.036 --> 00:06:17.589
which individual colonies at
that time were really like

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:20.550
little independent nation-state
colonies.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.610
They were not united in any
sense of the term.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.055
There wasn't any tradition of
colonies being able to

00:06:27.055 --> 00:06:28.639
communicate between each other.
 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.882
It was actually in some ways
easier to communicate with the

00:06:31.882 --> 00:06:35.180
mother country than to get some
kind of news up and down the

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.410
Atlantic seaboard.
 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.485
Colonists often knew more about
the mother country than they

00:06:39.485 --> 00:06:41.569
knew about people from other
colonies.

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.009
They--When you look at
correspondence from this period,

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:46.942
people often refer--Northerners
will refer to Southerners as

00:06:46.942 --> 00:06:48.930
though they're people from a
strange,

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.790
alien country who have weird
accents.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.720
It's hard to know what they are
saying;

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.139
they dress so strangely.
 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:00.084
It's amazing to think about the
differences, the degree to which

00:07:00.084 --> 00:07:04.009
colonies really stood alone in
this time period.

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:05.665
And this idea,
that there really is pretty

00:07:05.665 --> 00:07:08.048
much no reason to assume that
these colonies would have been

00:07:08.048 --> 00:07:10.305
able to join together,
that's pretty much going to be

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.250
in the first two or three
lectures of the course.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.601
What we talk about is we try
and get a sense of who these

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.935
colonists are,
and how they're ending up

00:07:17.935 --> 00:07:20.269
moving their way into a
revolution.

00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:25.095
So this scattered group of
independent colonists gradually

00:07:25.095 --> 00:07:30.173
came together to form one united
nation, not the goal but the

00:07:30.173 --> 00:07:31.189
outcome.
 

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:34.846
Given everything that I just
said, you can see why this idea

00:07:34.846 --> 00:07:38.504
that there might be a united
nation is actually a pretty big

00:07:38.504 --> 00:07:39.310
surprise.
 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.182
You can see why a lot of people
assumed that it could never

00:07:42.182 --> 00:07:42.529
work.
 

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:46.069
You can actually also assume
why a lot of people might not

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:50.358
even have liked it as an idea,
and you can even see why after

00:07:50.358 --> 00:07:54.387
the Constitution goes into
effect and the government is

00:07:54.387 --> 00:07:57.589
getting under way,
even then people were really

00:07:57.589 --> 00:08:00.040
just not sure this thing was
going to work.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.658
They really--They referred to
it as an experiment,

00:08:01.658 --> 00:08:02.879
which is really how they viewed
it.

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:07.274
And it's amazing when you look
at letters from the 1790s you'll

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:11.031
see these little throwaway
comments like "If this

00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:14.079
government lasts more than five
years,

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:16.129
here's what I think we should
do."

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:19.194
Okay, there--It's a completely
weird mindset and it's not

00:08:19.194 --> 00:08:22.369
something that we would assume
is there, but this is pretty

00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:24.230
much a high-stakes experiment.
 

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:29.851
So this class is going to
explore this big shift in

00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:33.015
mindset,
and the war will be at the

00:08:33.015 --> 00:08:36.283
center of this shift,
and it's going to do this from

00:08:36.283 --> 00:08:37.899
a participant's point of view.
 

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:41.495
It's going to really grapple
with how things made sense at

00:08:41.495 --> 00:08:44.019
the time to the people who were
there.

00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:47.269
And I'm going to go more in to
that in a minute or two.

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:49.684
I want to talk for just a
second about how the course is

00:08:49.684 --> 00:08:52.100
organized and just for a minute
or two about some of the

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.330
readings for the course.
 

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.894
The course is partly
chronological and partly

00:08:56.894 --> 00:09:00.993
thematic so we do proceed along,
we follow the narrative of

00:09:00.993 --> 00:09:03.980
events of how things evolved,
all those nasty acts,

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.076
people protesting,
have a war, try to figure out

00:09:07.076 --> 00:09:08.590
what to do after the war.
 

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.548
We do follow that sort of
trajectory,

00:09:11.548 --> 00:09:15.575
but we're also going to once in
a while step back and look at

00:09:15.575 --> 00:09:18.586
the big picture,
so that we're not just

00:09:18.586 --> 00:09:20.837
following events;
we're going to be always

00:09:20.837 --> 00:09:21.769
putting events in context.
 

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:25.028
And the readings for the course
go in that same direction.

00:09:25.028 --> 00:09:27.826
We're going to read Gordon
Wood's Radicalism of the

00:09:27.826 --> 00:09:30.589
American Revolution,
which is a really great

00:09:30.589 --> 00:09:34.090
overview of this time period and
also presents an argument,

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.548
obviously as you could tell
from the title,

00:09:35.548 --> 00:09:38.009
that the Revolution was really
radical.

00:09:38.009 --> 00:09:40.509
Some people agree with that and
some disagree,

00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:42.783
and actually one of the
discussion sections is geared

00:09:42.783 --> 00:09:44.360
around discussing that very
idea,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.624
and by the end of the course
you'll probably have some pretty

00:09:46.624 --> 00:09:48.700
strong ideas not necessarily
agreeing with mine but,

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.899
based on what you've read and
what I've said and what you've

00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:52.535
thought,
you'll probably have some

00:09:52.535 --> 00:09:55.480
strong ideas about how radical
was the American Revolution.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.682
We're going to be reading
Robert Gross's The Minutemen

00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:01.369
and Their World,
which you can hear is right

00:10:01.369 --> 00:10:04.000
along the lines of what I was
just saying.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.498
It really gives you a sense of
what it was like at the time for

00:10:06.498 --> 00:10:08.995
people who ended up doing things
like fighting at Lexington and

00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:09.480
Concord.
 

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.590
We're going to read Bernard
Bailyn's Faces of Revolution,

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.410
which includes an array of
chapters on different people who

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.861
played a major role in the
Revolution as well as chapters

00:10:21.861 --> 00:10:25.251
on the ideals and the ideology
or basically the logic of

00:10:25.251 --> 00:10:29.379
American independence,
and Bailyn is really well known

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:31.923
as sort of--
He wrote this amazing book on

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:34.190
the ideology of the American
Revolution,

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.330
and what you're going to be
reading;

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.158
he basically took a big,
meaty chunk from that book,

00:10:39.158 --> 00:10:41.288
the part that everybody really
focuses on,

00:10:41.288 --> 00:10:43.538
and put it in this book,
Faces of Revolution,

00:10:43.538 --> 00:10:48.731
so we will be reading that
as well as part of the readings

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.178
for the course.
 

00:10:50.178 --> 00:10:52.827
We're also going to be reading
Ray Raphael's A People's

00:10:52.827 --> 00:10:55.336
History of the American
Revolution, which does just

00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:56.870
what the title would suggest.
 

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.668
It does--It looks at how
different kinds of people,

00:10:59.668 --> 00:11:04.106
Native Americans,
average rebels,

00:11:04.106 --> 00:11:07.735
African Americans,
Loyalists, women,

00:11:07.735 --> 00:11:09.884
how all of these different
people of different types

00:11:09.884 --> 00:11:11.149
experienced the Revolution.
 

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:13.936
And then in addition to reading
historical scholarship,

00:11:13.936 --> 00:11:17.288
we're going to be reading some
of the literature of the period.

00:11:17.288 --> 00:11:20.052
We're going to be reading
Thomas Paine's Common Sense,

00:11:20.052 --> 00:11:20.990
which I love.
 

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.370
How many of you have read
Common Sense before?

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.620
A good number of you,
not--yeah, some of you.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.443
I love Common Sense.
I think it's an amazing piece

00:11:31.443 --> 00:11:34.024
of writing,
and I think when you read it

00:11:34.024 --> 00:11:37.870
for this course you'll get a
sense of why it had such a huge

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.500
influence at the time.
 

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.043
We're going to read some essays
from The Federalist

00:11:42.043 --> 00:11:44.636
written by Alexander
Hamilton and James Madison and

00:11:44.636 --> 00:11:47.306
John Jay,
but we are not going to read

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:51.038
them as--
You may have read them before.

00:11:51.038 --> 00:11:54.647
You may have encountered The
Federalist essays as the

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:57.398
grand source of authority on the
Constitution.

00:11:57.398 --> 00:11:58.009
Right?
 

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.615
How could it not be that when
you have Founder-type guys

00:12:00.615 --> 00:12:03.506
talking about the Constitution
and they were the guys who were

00:12:03.506 --> 00:12:04.548
at the convention?
 

00:12:04.548 --> 00:12:07.309
Well, the fact of the matter is
The Federalist essays

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:09.509
weren't intended to be an
objective document.

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:10.928
They're actually really
subjective,

00:12:10.928 --> 00:12:14.961
and we're going to look at them
in this course as what they were

00:12:14.961 --> 00:12:16.981
written to be,
which is a really big

00:12:16.981 --> 00:12:19.158
commercial advertisement for
this new experimental

00:12:19.158 --> 00:12:19.870
Constitution.
 

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.600
They were actually trying to
sell people on an idea,

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.143
and because of that,
as we'll see when we read that

00:12:25.143 --> 00:12:27.715
for this course,
there are things in there that

00:12:27.715 --> 00:12:30.551
maybe are a little bit
exaggerated and things in there

00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:33.761
that maybe aren't talked about
in great detail and one or two

00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:36.918
things that probably aren't
really true but it was in a good

00:12:36.918 --> 00:12:37.240
cause.
 

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:37.990
Right?
 

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.649
These guys are saying,
"I really think this

00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:40.779
Constitution is the way to go.
 

00:12:40.779 --> 00:12:44.042
Let me say something that's
going to really calm you so that

00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:46.529
we can go ahead with this
experiment."

00:12:46.529 --> 00:12:48.294
And of course we're going to be
reading the Declaration of

00:12:48.294 --> 00:12:48.759
Independence.
 

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:50.538
We're going to be reading the
Constitution.

00:12:50.538 --> 00:12:53.833
We're going to be reading a lot
of documents and letters and

00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:57.240
other kinds of assorted items to
really give us a sense of the

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.894
period,
and at one point I'm even going

00:12:59.894 --> 00:13:03.860
to bring in a newspaper from the
period so that we can actually

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.638
look at it and get a sense of
how people are getting news of

00:13:07.638 --> 00:13:09.428
the war at that moment.
 

00:13:09.428 --> 00:13:13.826
A lot of these documents we're
going to pull from a book called

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:18.009
Major Problems in the Era of
the American Revolution,

00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:19.932
and it's a nice collection
of primary documents and essays

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:20.908
about sort of related themes.
 

00:13:20.908 --> 00:13:24.630
It always makes me laugh when I
say that title because it's part

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.057
of a series of books and the
books are Major Problems in

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:30.326
the Revolution,
Major Problems in the Early

00:13:30.326 --> 00:13:32.613
National Period,
Major Problems in the Civil

00:13:32.613 --> 00:13:36.086
War, so basically all of
American history appears to be a

00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:37.825
major problem,
[laughter]

00:13:37.825 --> 00:13:40.259
which--It kind of gives me
pause,

00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:42.684
but despite that,
it's a nice collection of

00:13:42.684 --> 00:13:45.399
things and we'll be using that
for the class.

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:49.038
So that gives you a sense of
how the course is going to flow

00:13:49.038 --> 00:13:51.690
and what these readings are
going to do,

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.760
which brings me to the portion
of the lecture that I'm going to

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.386
call Freeman's Top Five Tips for
Studying the American

00:13:57.386 --> 00:14:00.219
Revolution,
and I want to explain before I

00:14:00.219 --> 00:14:02.870
launch into them what the heck I
mean.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.813
Basically, when I was preparing
this lecture and thinking to

00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:10.691
myself what do I want you to
know about right at the outset

00:14:10.691 --> 00:14:14.769
before we even start talking
about the Revolution itself.

00:14:14.769 --> 00:14:18.216
And I ended up with a list of
things that as I talk about them

00:14:18.216 --> 00:14:21.113
here may seem obvious,
but the more I talk about them

00:14:21.113 --> 00:14:23.190
I think the less obvious they'll
appear,

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.937
and they're actually really
important to consider in a

00:14:26.937 --> 00:14:31.110
course that deals with something
like America's founding.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.830
There's a lot wrapped up in
that.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:33.879
Just that phrase.
 

00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:36.807
Just think about the
phrase--right?--the 'Founding

00:14:36.807 --> 00:14:38.840
Fathers,' the 'Founding Period.'
 

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.570
You just can see the capital
letters.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:42.605
[laughs]
You don't even need to see it

00:14:42.605 --> 00:14:42.970
in writing.
 

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.190
In your mind it's always
capitalized.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.479
We assume a lot of things about
this time period,

00:14:48.479 --> 00:14:52.110
and it's sort of an iconic
period when you think about

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.548
American history.
 

00:14:53.548 --> 00:14:56.567
To us, a lot of the people and
events of this time period and

00:14:56.567 --> 00:14:59.433
the documents of this time
period are kind of what America

00:14:59.433 --> 00:15:02.107
is all about,
which is understandable,

00:15:02.107 --> 00:15:06.159
but to think about the founding
period as historians,

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:08.658
we need to think differently.
 

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.168
We need to be aware of all of
those assumptions,

00:15:11.168 --> 00:15:14.466
all of that cultural baggage
that we bring when we're looking

00:15:14.466 --> 00:15:16.940
at something like the American
Revolution,

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.999
we need to be aware of them,
and then we need to get past

00:15:19.999 --> 00:15:23.277
them so that we can really begin
to understand the people and

00:15:23.277 --> 00:15:25.899
events of the Revolution for
what they were.

00:15:25.899 --> 00:15:28.828
And that's how I got to
Freeman's Top Five Tips for

00:15:28.828 --> 00:15:30.879
Studying the American
Revolution;

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:34.436
five things that you should
bear in mind when studying this

00:15:34.436 --> 00:15:36.418
period,
five things obviously that will

00:15:36.418 --> 00:15:38.450
be useful to remember throughout
the course,

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.250
basically all of them aimed at
just shaking the assumptions

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.428
right out of us.
 

00:15:43.428 --> 00:15:46.250
And the first tip is actually
really related to that point.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.529
The first tip is:
Avoid the dreaded Revolutionary

00:15:49.529 --> 00:15:50.759
War fact bubble.
 

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:52.851
And what I mean by that is
you're going to be sitting here

00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:54.945
and over the course of the
semester you're going to hear a

00:15:54.945 --> 00:15:56.340
lot of familiar names and
events,

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.678
Boston Tea Party,
George Washington,

00:15:59.678 --> 00:16:01.408
the greatest hits of the
Revolution,

00:16:01.408 --> 00:16:03.408
the things you know and love
and learned in high school.

00:16:03.408 --> 00:16:06.576
They're all going to be here
and hearing all of these beloved

00:16:06.576 --> 00:16:09.955
greatest hits you may be tempted
to sort of sit back in your seat

00:16:09.955 --> 00:16:12.700
and drift along with the happy,
familiar events.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.519
Aaah, the story of the American
Revolution;

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:17.230
I love the story of the
American Revolution.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.893
Well, I love the story of the
American Revolution but there's

00:16:19.893 --> 00:16:22.335
a different story of the
American Revolution besides all

00:16:22.335 --> 00:16:24.793
these names,
facts, and dates that you

00:16:24.793 --> 00:16:27.928
probably have arrived here with
in your head.

00:16:27.928 --> 00:16:31.899
It's a really good dramatic
story but it's not a string of

00:16:31.899 --> 00:16:34.200
facts, so thus the fact bubble.
 

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.240
It's not a fact bubble.
 

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.304
The Revolution obviously is a
lot more than that and you need

00:16:38.304 --> 00:16:41.421
to sort of almost be aware of
the fact and then allow yourself

00:16:41.421 --> 00:16:43.720
to step back and look at the big
picture.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.624
And John Adams and Benjamin
Rush and others like them would

00:16:46.624 --> 00:16:49.577
have been the first to tell you
the facts in a sense are the

00:16:49.577 --> 00:16:50.379
least of it.
 

00:16:50.379 --> 00:16:54.596
So that's--Tip number one is
don't get lost in the dreaded

00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:58.857
Revolutionary War fact bubble,
which I have to say it makes me

00:16:58.857 --> 00:17:01.850
think of the first time that I
taught this course.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.965
I was actually a brand new
professor and I had just come to

00:17:04.965 --> 00:17:08.243
Yale and it was my first course
and it was my first lecture in

00:17:08.243 --> 00:17:10.338
my first course and I'm [sound
cuts out]

00:17:10.338 --> 00:17:12.650
It actually was in Connecticut
Hall,

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.690
which, for those of you who
don't know,

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:19.565
dates back to the period when
this course is talking about and

00:17:19.565 --> 00:17:22.890
was Nathan Hale's--
essentially his dorm.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:23.394
So there I am.
 

00:17:23.394 --> 00:17:25.489
I'm a brand new professor to
Yale and I'm teaching a course

00:17:25.489 --> 00:17:27.655
about the Revolution and it's in
a building that dates to the

00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:29.327
Revolution,
so I'm having sort of a

00:17:29.327 --> 00:17:31.118
"wow"
Yale moment as it is,

00:17:31.118 --> 00:17:32.609
and I'm off,
I'm giving my lectures,

00:17:32.609 --> 00:17:33.818
and I'm really excited.
 

00:17:33.818 --> 00:17:36.900
I give about three of them and
someone raises their hand after

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.474
about three lectures and they
have kind of a puzzled

00:17:39.474 --> 00:17:40.940
expression on their face.
 

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.380
I said, "Yes?"
 

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.756
And he says,
"Excuse me,

00:17:43.756 --> 00:17:44.740
Professor Freeman.
 

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.450
What are we supposed to be
memorizing?

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.029
Where are the facts and
dates?"

00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:52.738
[laughs]
So as a new professor my first

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.690
impulse was: Darn!
 

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.740
I forgot the facts and dates.
 

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.108
[laughter] I got it wrong.
 

00:17:59.108 --> 00:18:00.509
[laughs]
But actually,

00:18:00.509 --> 00:18:04.039
the fact of the matter is,
they're not the star of the

00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:04.640
show.
 

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.740
Certainly, dates are not the
star of the show.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.039
There are dates you're going to
have to remember so don't think

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:11.115
Easy Street;
there's not a date I have to

00:18:11.115 --> 00:18:11.450
know.
 

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:15.429
There will be some dates,
but this isn't a story about

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:16.028
dates.
 

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:17.931
It's obviously something a lot
more interesting and a lot

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:18.609
broader than that.
 

00:18:18.609 --> 00:18:20.108
Okay. Avoid fact bubble.
 

00:18:20.108 --> 00:18:23.883
Tip number two:
Think about the meaning of

00:18:23.883 --> 00:18:24.618
words.
 

00:18:24.618 --> 00:18:28.518
Now on the one hand,
this may seem really obvious

00:18:28.518 --> 00:18:32.009
and you may be sitting here
thinking oh,

00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:33.863
great, this is going to be a
semester of Freeman saying:

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.009
"What does revolution
mean?

00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:39.765
What does war mean?",
which would be a really,

00:18:39.765 --> 00:18:41.982
really, really long semester,
and that's actually

00:18:41.982 --> 00:18:43.578
maybe--There might even be a
point where I'll say,

00:18:43.578 --> 00:18:46.009
"What does revolution
mean?"

00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:47.737
I even kind of,
sort of said it already,

00:18:47.737 --> 00:18:50.527
but that's not what I mean when
I say think about the meaning of

00:18:50.527 --> 00:18:50.970
words.
 

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.932
What I really mean here is be
careful what you assume about

00:18:54.932 --> 00:18:59.170
words because what seems obvious
in meaning to you now probably

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.858
meant something really different
in 1776 or 1787,

00:19:02.858 --> 00:19:05.044
and I want to look at one
example because it's a really

00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:07.348
striking one and that's the word
"democracy."

00:19:07.348 --> 00:19:07.749
Okay.
 

00:19:07.749 --> 00:19:11.423
So sitting here in this room,
by our standards,

00:19:11.423 --> 00:19:13.740
democracy is a good thing.
 

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.332
Right?
 

00:19:14.332 --> 00:19:17.000
Democracy is a good thing.
 

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.461
Every once in a while as a
professor you say something and

00:19:19.461 --> 00:19:22.137
then you think with horror about
how it's going to look in your

00:19:22.137 --> 00:19:22.568
notes.
 

00:19:22.568 --> 00:19:24.558
So you'll have all these notes,
and then it will say

00:19:24.558 --> 00:19:26.548
"democracy is a good
thing," [laughs]--

00:19:26.548 --> 00:19:31.038
a really sophisticated class
we're teaching here at Yale.

00:19:31.038 --> 00:19:34.730
But to us it's good,
and to people in the founding

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.690
generation, not so much.
 

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.940
They weren't so sure about it.
 

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.346
To them the word
"democracy"

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:44.053
signaled a kind of government
in which every single person

00:19:44.053 --> 00:19:48.421
participated personally,
not a government based on

00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:50.009
representation.
 

00:19:50.009 --> 00:19:53.352
We're talking mass politics,
in the minds of most people in

00:19:53.352 --> 00:19:57.038
the founding generation just the
definition of what chaos was.

00:19:57.038 --> 00:20:01.632
So just listen to a sentence in
one of the last letters written

00:20:01.632 --> 00:20:05.557
by Alexander Hamilton,
1804, the night before his duel

00:20:05.557 --> 00:20:07.038
with Aaron Burr.
 

00:20:07.038 --> 00:20:09.273
So he's sort of speaking to
posterity in case he should die

00:20:09.273 --> 00:20:10.970
and this is what he writes in
this letter.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.798
"I will here express but
one sentiment,

00:20:13.798 --> 00:20:17.000
which is that the dismemberment
of our empire"--

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.910
I love the fact that America's
an empire in 1804--

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.689
"will be a clear sacrifice
of great positive advantages

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:26.058
without any counterbalancing
good,

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:29.430
administering no relief to our
real disease,

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.108
which is democracy."
 

00:20:31.108 --> 00:20:31.728
Okay.
 

00:20:31.728 --> 00:20:38.038
Our real disease is democracy,
Alexander Hamilton.

00:20:38.038 --> 00:20:39.983
Now admittedly,
Hamilton might not be the

00:20:39.983 --> 00:20:43.095
shining example of the point I'm
trying to make here because he's

00:20:43.095 --> 00:20:45.914
not exactly Mr. Democracy so
you wouldn't really expect him

00:20:45.914 --> 00:20:47.858
to be clapping his hands for it.
 

00:20:47.858 --> 00:20:51.390
But now listen to Thomas
Jefferson, who maybe you would

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:52.960
brand Mr. Democracy.
 

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.785
So Jefferson in 1816 is
chatting away with someone in a

00:20:56.785 --> 00:21:00.397
letter about what America's
trying to do and whether

00:21:00.397 --> 00:21:03.484
America's actually achieving it,
and he says,

00:21:03.484 --> 00:21:05.230
'Actually, democracy is pretty
impractical.'

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.403
He can imagine it in a town but
outside of one town it just

00:21:09.403 --> 00:21:13.009
won't work;
again, really clear.

00:21:13.009 --> 00:21:15.368
Their sense of what that word
means is really different from

00:21:15.368 --> 00:21:16.808
our sense of what that word
means.

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:21.215
Now Jefferson immediately goes
on to add that democratical--a

00:21:21.215 --> 00:21:25.474
democratical but representative
government is a good thing.

00:21:25.474 --> 00:21:26.210
Right?
 

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.393
A democracy,
not so much,

00:21:27.393 --> 00:21:29.330
but democratical,
which is a great--In the

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.630
eighteenth century they were
always adding "ical"

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.749
on to the end of things,
which could end perfectly

00:21:33.749 --> 00:21:34.960
happily with a "c."
 

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.827
[laughs]
This is a great

00:21:35.827 --> 00:21:38.130
eighteenth-century-sounding
word, "democratical."

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.820
A democratical representative
government is a good thing,

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.140
but democracy not.
 

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:48.646
So the moral of this story is
don't fall in to what I call

00:21:48.646 --> 00:21:50.288
'democraspeak.'
 

00:21:50.288 --> 00:21:53.248
Don't write papers where you
toss around terms like

00:21:53.248 --> 00:21:55.732
"democracy,"
"liberty,"

00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:58.633
"freedom,"
without really thinking about

00:21:58.633 --> 00:22:01.000
what you mean and what they
meant.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.430
As Americans we're used to
tossing those words around,

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:08.038
but to early Americans,
if you think about it,

00:22:08.038 --> 00:22:09.932
to early American slave
holders, words like

00:22:09.932 --> 00:22:11.778
"liberty,"
other such words,

00:22:11.778 --> 00:22:14.640
have a much more complicated
meaning.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.482
So tip number two:
Think about the meaning of

00:22:17.482 --> 00:22:18.000
words.
 

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.058
Which brings us to tip number
three: Remember that Founders

00:22:22.058 --> 00:22:23.038
were people.
 

00:22:23.038 --> 00:22:25.078
Now as I was writing this I
thought oh,

00:22:25.078 --> 00:22:27.549
that's another one of those
things I don't want to see in

00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:28.565
people's notes:
[laughs]

00:22:28.565 --> 00:22:31.190
Democracy is good,
Founders are people.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.702
[laughs]
Such a highfalutin' course I'm

00:22:33.702 --> 00:22:34.759
teaching here.
 

00:22:34.759 --> 00:22:38.826
Again it sounds really obvious,
but what I really mean here is

00:22:38.826 --> 00:22:41.759
we tend to forget this pretty
simple fact.

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:44.009
We forget that the Founders
were people.

00:22:44.009 --> 00:22:47.218
We assume that they were these
all-knowing demigods who were

00:22:47.218 --> 00:22:50.535
sort of calmly walking their way
through the creation of a new

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:51.460
model nation.
 

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.200
We kind of deify them.
 

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.442
We put them up on this sort of
-- aah--founder mountaintop of

00:22:57.442 --> 00:23:00.694
American history,
and it's--really it's easy to

00:23:00.694 --> 00:23:01.190
do.
 

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.555
Sometimes just listening to
their words or reading their

00:23:03.555 --> 00:23:05.490
words would inspire you to want
to do that.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.259
Here is a random phrase.
 

00:23:07.259 --> 00:23:10.028
I thought what could I write
here that would be sort of

00:23:10.028 --> 00:23:12.440
inspiring Founder talk and this
was the one--

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.109
two sentences that I came up
with just because they always

00:23:15.109 --> 00:23:17.640
stick in my mind because they
sound kind of amazing.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.868
This is actually Thomas Paine,
Common Sense.

00:23:19.868 --> 00:23:23.606
In the middle of it he
writes, "We have it in our

00:23:23.606 --> 00:23:26.098
power to begin the world over
again.

00:23:26.098 --> 00:23:29.640
The birthday of a new world is
at hand."

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:29.952
Okay.
 

00:23:29.952 --> 00:23:32.390
That's really--That's inspiring
stuff.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.961
That's fine writing,
but that's inspiring talk and

00:23:34.961 --> 00:23:37.797
it's supposed to be obviously
because Paine's trying to

00:23:37.797 --> 00:23:40.368
convince people that
independence is a really good

00:23:40.368 --> 00:23:42.487
idea,
but these kinds of words,

00:23:42.487 --> 00:23:46.067
this sort of glorious rhetoric,
shouldn't block out the simple

00:23:46.067 --> 00:23:48.009
fact that the Founders were
people.

00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:49.440
They were regular human beings.
 

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.220
They were well educated,
they were thoughtful,

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.815
they were sometimes
well-meaning,

00:23:53.815 --> 00:23:55.608
they were sometimes
hard-working,

00:23:55.608 --> 00:23:59.140
maybe sometimes not so much,
they were people aiming high,

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.440
they were people who did feel
responsible to posterity,

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.410
but still they were people.
 

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:08.045
And to me this is one of the
really exciting things about

00:24:08.045 --> 00:24:11.940
history generally and about this
time period specifically.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.828
We're talking about people
trying to figure things out.

00:24:14.828 --> 00:24:18.250
We're talking about the most
basic things about America--

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.750
right?--its existence,
[laughs]

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.097
that it is a nation,
that it has a constitution,

00:24:22.097 --> 00:24:24.538
and we're looking at people
trying to figure out how all

00:24:24.538 --> 00:24:26.935
that stuff is going to be
created and how it's going to

00:24:26.935 --> 00:24:27.380
work.
 

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.130
These are people who are scared.
 

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.328
These are people who make dumb
mistakes on occasion.

00:24:32.328 --> 00:24:34.608
They're figuring it out as they
go.

00:24:34.608 --> 00:24:39.535
The history of this period is a
history of decisions of various

00:24:39.535 --> 00:24:42.269
kinds,
and these were hard decisions

00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:46.032
and they were being made by
people who did not know the

00:24:46.032 --> 00:24:46.798
answers.
 

00:24:46.798 --> 00:24:51.038
They're making it up as they go
along.

00:24:51.038 --> 00:24:53.642
I think that's just fascinating
when you just read their

00:24:53.642 --> 00:24:56.433
correspondence and get a sense
of how much they're really in

00:24:56.433 --> 00:24:57.048
the dark.
 

00:24:57.048 --> 00:24:58.950
There's--Actually,
when you read letters from the

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.088
period, a lot of them say the
same thing right when the

00:25:01.088 --> 00:25:02.038
government launches.
 

00:25:02.038 --> 00:25:05.148
I think George Washington and
James Madison and a Pennsylvania

00:25:05.148 --> 00:25:07.288
senator almost say the exact
same thing.

00:25:07.288 --> 00:25:08.949
It's almost like they went in
to a room and said,

00:25:08.949 --> 00:25:10.990
"So how will we express
being scared at this moment?

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.680
Aah, here's a good
sentence."

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.964
They all say basically,
"I feel like I'm walking

00:25:14.964 --> 00:25:15.798
on hollow ground.
 

00:25:15.798 --> 00:25:18.920
I feel like the ground's going
to break beneath my feet."

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.712
They've just launched this
Constitution and they all are

00:25:21.712 --> 00:25:24.405
sort of standing there on the
national stage thinking,

00:25:24.405 --> 00:25:25.930
what if this all explodes?
 

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.930
Do we actually know what we're
doing?

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:31.000
That's a really fascinating
part of this period to me.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Now of course sometimes people
did try to figure out the

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.838
answers in a wonderful sort of
Enlightenment way,

00:25:36.838 --> 00:25:40.700
and my favorite example of this
is James Madison who prepared

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.173
himself ultimately for the
Constitutional Convention by

00:25:44.173 --> 00:25:47.069
studying all governments across
all time.

00:25:47.069 --> 00:25:48.808
[laughs] Can you imagine?
 

00:25:48.808 --> 00:25:52.421
Well, I'd better go study all
of government ever [laughter]

00:25:52.421 --> 00:25:55.410
to get ready for this
convention, but he does.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:59.048
It's a great sort of
Enlightenment thing to do.

00:25:59.048 --> 00:26:01.912
He's thinking I will now
discover the eternal pattern of

00:26:01.912 --> 00:26:05.191
politics and he's thinking if I
can do that then I can reach for

00:26:05.191 --> 00:26:06.758
the best,
I can avoid the worst,

00:26:06.758 --> 00:26:09.006
and whatever we're going to do
when we make a new government

00:26:09.006 --> 00:26:11.291
maybe we're going to actually do
something better than what's

00:26:11.291 --> 00:26:11.940
come before.
 

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.688
So there's a logic to it;
as ambitious as it is there's a

00:26:14.688 --> 00:26:15.048
logic.
 

00:26:15.048 --> 00:26:17.643
And he was serious about it so
it wasn't even just I wonder

00:26:17.643 --> 00:26:19.788
what happens if I read a lot
about government.

00:26:19.788 --> 00:26:21.058
He actually was serious about
it.

00:26:21.058 --> 00:26:24.141
He even made a kind of a little
chart in which he listed the

00:26:24.141 --> 00:26:26.440
governments and then listed pros
and cons.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.470
You know, like what did I think
of Sparta?

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.180
He's sort of [laughter]
amazing, across all time,

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:37.009
so I love the fact that he did
that Founder-like thing to do,

00:26:37.009 --> 00:26:38.938
but there you see a person,
a really intellectually

00:26:38.938 --> 00:26:41.519
ambitious person,
trying to figure things out

00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:43.798
like how do we know what to
make?

00:26:43.798 --> 00:26:45.250
[laughs]
What's this constitution

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:46.338
supposed to look like?
 

00:26:46.338 --> 00:26:47.670
How are we going to figure that
out?

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:48.075
Okay.
 

00:26:48.075 --> 00:26:52.288
I'll just study all of
government and let you know.

00:26:52.288 --> 00:26:55.740
So when we talk about the
American Revolution we're

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.742
talking about people and this
course takes this idea really

00:26:59.742 --> 00:27:00.710
seriously.
 

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.634
Part of what we're going to be
doing over the course of the

00:27:04.634 --> 00:27:08.221
semester is looking at the
Revolution from the vantage

00:27:08.221 --> 00:27:11.530
point of participants,
trying to see how people at the

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.920
time understood the events
unfolding around them.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.942
How did the colonists
understand themselves as British

00:27:16.942 --> 00:27:17.568
subjects?
 

00:27:17.568 --> 00:27:22.259
How did they feel about the
British empire or about the King

00:27:22.259 --> 00:27:24.009
or about Parliament?
 

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:25.900
How did they come to put
American-ness in the foreground?

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.259
How did rebelling against their
own country make sense?

00:27:30.259 --> 00:27:32.470
And that's something I think we
also tend to forget about the

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.950
Revolution.
 

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:37.180
We think of it as our war;
it's us against them and them

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.955
equals the British,
but of course we were the

00:27:38.955 --> 00:27:39.400
British.
 

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.101
So it's something that you
don't think about but people at

00:27:42.101 --> 00:27:44.292
the time,
certainly in the 1790s,

00:27:44.292 --> 00:27:47.892
people referred to this as
"the Civil War"

00:27:47.892 --> 00:27:50.009
because that's what it was.
 

00:27:50.009 --> 00:27:52.154
It's just not the way we happen
to think about it because in our

00:27:52.154 --> 00:27:54.130
mind we've already traveled down
the road and we're already

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:55.594
"us"
but in their mind it was in a

00:27:55.594 --> 00:28:01.048
sense brother against brother;
it was us against us.

00:28:01.048 --> 00:28:03.196
So we're going to try to keep
that sort of thing in mind as we

00:28:03.196 --> 00:28:05.380
explore how the events of this
time made sense at that time.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.223
And I will say here we are not
going to forget about the

00:28:08.223 --> 00:28:11.430
British so we're not going to
have a patriot-centric course.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.500
The British have a logic to
what they're doing,

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.999
whether they're making policy
or whether they're fighting

00:28:15.999 --> 00:28:18.259
battles,
and we will definitely look at

00:28:18.259 --> 00:28:21.682
the logic of what the British
are doing as well as what the

00:28:21.682 --> 00:28:23.038
colonists are doing.
 

00:28:23.038 --> 00:28:25.753
Now I will admit right here up
front that I will be offering

00:28:25.753 --> 00:28:28.192
you a sampling of really
arrogant British quotes about

00:28:28.192 --> 00:28:30.347
crude colonists,
and I'm doing that partly

00:28:30.347 --> 00:28:32.058
because there's just so many
good,

00:28:32.058 --> 00:28:34.034
really arrogant quotes about
[laughs]

00:28:34.034 --> 00:28:37.380
American colonists that I can't
resist sprinkling them through

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.561
my lectures and I can't resist
that so much that I have two

00:28:40.561 --> 00:28:43.853
here that I just randomly added
in because I have a reason to

00:28:43.853 --> 00:28:45.058
and so I will.
 

00:28:45.058 --> 00:28:47.865
But it's just--it gives you a
sense of how at least some of

00:28:47.865 --> 00:28:50.721
the British were thinking and
looking at really these little

00:28:50.721 --> 00:28:52.558
upstarts on the margins of
empire.

00:28:52.558 --> 00:28:56.818
So random arrogant British
quote number one,

00:28:56.818 --> 00:29:02.009
and this is from a customs
official: "American

00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:06.526
colonists are a most rude,
depraved, degenerate race,

00:29:06.526 --> 00:29:10.116
and it is a mortification to us
that they speak English and can

00:29:10.116 --> 00:29:12.549
trace themselves from that
stock."

00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:14.230
[laughter] Wow.
 

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.715
[laughter]
Just--Even English is a

00:29:16.715 --> 00:29:17.470
problem.
 

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.529
That's a statement.
 

00:29:19.529 --> 00:29:21.358
Okay.
 

00:29:21.358 --> 00:29:23.988
Arrogant quote number two,
and this one I picked just

00:29:23.988 --> 00:29:26.009
because it's about George
Washington,

00:29:26.009 --> 00:29:28.240
and it's hard to imagine people
saying something arrogant about

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.509
George Washington who seems to
be Mr. Symbol of Authority,

00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:34.080
but here's another British
official who met with George

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.048
Washington and then wrote back
home about what he thought.

00:29:38.048 --> 00:29:39.945
And he says,
"Somehow,

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:43.884
and I can't imagine how,
he's learned the basics of how

00:29:43.884 --> 00:29:46.730
to behave in a court
society."

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:50.817
It's like, 'ooh.' [laughter]
That must have been a really

00:29:50.817 --> 00:29:53.808
fun interview,
too, if that's the attitude

00:29:53.808 --> 00:29:55.048
this guy had.
 

00:29:55.048 --> 00:29:57.656
So there'll be a sprinkling of
that because at dramatic moments

00:29:57.656 --> 00:29:59.928
in the war there's always
someone who steps forward and

00:29:59.928 --> 00:30:01.190
offers that point of view.
 

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.465
That said, we are going to do
justice to the British side of

00:30:04.465 --> 00:30:07.361
the dispute,
to the logic behind the policy

00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:10.056
that they were making,
because it's not as though they

00:30:10.056 --> 00:30:12.015
make a bunch of dumb policies
that make absolutely no sense

00:30:12.015 --> 00:30:13.940
and we're righteously outraged
and then there's a war.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.028
Their policies made sense to
them.

00:30:16.028 --> 00:30:18.896
They didn't happen to always
make sense to the colonists but

00:30:18.896 --> 00:30:21.196
they made sense to them,
and the same thing goes with

00:30:21.196 --> 00:30:23.540
British battle plans which,
looking back in the long view

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.500
of time when we start talking
about them,

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.821
might seem a little goofy but
there's actually a lot of logic

00:30:29.821 --> 00:30:34.073
for what they were trying to do
when they were attacking the

00:30:34.073 --> 00:30:35.009
colonies.
 

00:30:35.009 --> 00:30:37.919
Oh, and I will also mention --
I guess I probably don't have

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.298
time to talk about it now.
 

00:30:39.298 --> 00:30:41.920
When I was preparing this
lecture, casting around,

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.029
trying to figure out what will
I put in the lecture,

00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:47.150
I don't know how I came across
it but I discovered the Battle

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:47.680
of New Haven.
 

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.799
Did anyone know about the
Battle of New Haven?

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:51.980
Because I did not know.
 

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.960
And I know there's hostilities
around--

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.542
and I don't know if there's
Yale lore that of course you're

00:30:57.542 --> 00:30:59.567
all sitting there saying,
"Well, of course we all

00:30:59.567 --> 00:31:00.981
know about the Battle of New
Haven," [laughter]

00:31:00.981 --> 00:31:01.871
but I--
[laughter]

00:31:01.871 --> 00:31:05.298
I'm the only one who doesn't
know about the Battle of New

00:31:05.298 --> 00:31:08.348
Haven,
but it's --actually it's a good

00:31:08.348 --> 00:31:08.900
story.
 

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.648
I'm not going to tell it now.
 

00:31:09.648 --> 00:31:10.578
I'm going to leave you in
suspense.

00:31:10.578 --> 00:31:12.243
It will appear when we start
getting in to the fighting of

00:31:12.243 --> 00:31:14.830
the Revolution,
but let me just give you the

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.502
sneak preview,
which is it does involve the

00:31:17.502 --> 00:31:20.915
president of Yale College with a
gun in his hand running to fight

00:31:20.915 --> 00:31:22.657
the British,
so it's [laughter]

00:31:22.657 --> 00:31:25.719
a Yale moment that we have,
so I will talk about the Battle

00:31:25.719 --> 00:31:26.402
of New Haven.
 

00:31:26.402 --> 00:31:26.769
Okay.
 

00:31:26.769 --> 00:31:30.190
So we aren't going to be
looking at a story of good guys

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:31.308
versus bad guys.
 

00:31:31.308 --> 00:31:35.598
We will be reconstructing
opposing points of view,

00:31:35.598 --> 00:31:37.990
trying to figure out how those
points of view made sense and

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.140
then obviously we'll be able to
step back and say,

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.481
"What happens when you put
those two opposing points of

00:31:42.481 --> 00:31:44.068
view in contact with each
other?"

00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:46.940
So tip three:
Founders are people.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.808
Which brings us to tip four:
We're not just talking about

00:31:50.808 --> 00:31:51.568
Founders.
 

00:31:51.568 --> 00:31:55.439
The Revolution was not just a
quiet conversation between a

00:31:55.439 --> 00:31:58.630
bunch of guys wearing wigs and
knee britches.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.943
Right?
 

00:31:58.943 --> 00:32:02.192
We sort of have this image that
the Revolution is guys in short

00:32:02.192 --> 00:32:04.288
pants with wigs in a room doing
this.

00:32:04.288 --> 00:32:04.434
No.
 

00:32:04.434 --> 00:32:06.281
[laughter]
That's the entire founding I

00:32:06.281 --> 00:32:07.740
think in our minds sort of.
 

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:08.568
I'll say that right.
 

00:32:08.568 --> 00:32:10.221
So that's not the Revolution.
 

00:32:10.221 --> 00:32:10.619
Right?
 

00:32:10.619 --> 00:32:14.000
That's not what happened.
 

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.890
We're talking about a
revolution, a popular uprising

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.063
by vast numbers of colonists
fought on American ground by

00:32:20.063 --> 00:32:24.298
Americans of all kinds,
and it meant different things

00:32:24.298 --> 00:32:27.038
to different kinds of people.
 

00:32:27.038 --> 00:32:29.248
This is not to say that the
Founders aren't important,

00:32:29.248 --> 00:32:30.873
far from it,
and as you will gather very

00:32:30.873 --> 00:32:32.538
quickly in this course I love
these guys.

00:32:32.538 --> 00:32:33.038
Right?
 

00:32:33.038 --> 00:32:36.115
I love talking about these
guys, I love writing about these

00:32:36.115 --> 00:32:39.031
guys, so I'm certainly not
saying, "Who cares about

00:32:39.031 --> 00:32:40.038
Founders?"
 

00:32:40.038 --> 00:32:41.766
But what I am saying is that
they're not the only ones who

00:32:41.766 --> 00:32:42.098
mattered.
 

00:32:42.098 --> 00:32:45.230
They didn't have their own
revolution while everybody else

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.779
watched.
 

00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:49.859
We're talking about a popular
revolution grounded on the ideas

00:32:49.859 --> 00:32:53.606
and actions of people throughout
many different levels of

00:32:53.606 --> 00:32:54.410
society.
 

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:58.038
Now somewhat conversely this
brings us to John Adams.

00:32:58.038 --> 00:33:00.461
As I promised at the beginning,
John Adams is coming and here's

00:33:00.461 --> 00:33:00.970
John Adams.
 

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:04.500
You'll be hearing from him more
than once this semester and

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.214
actually you already heard from
him once so I can promise that

00:33:08.214 --> 00:33:09.190
that's true.
 

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.840
This isn't because I think that
John Adams is the most important

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.288
figure from the period.
 

00:33:14.288 --> 00:33:17.730
It's not because I think that
he's always right.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:22.174
In fact, the reason I quote him
a lot is he's a brilliant,

00:33:22.174 --> 00:33:25.996
blunt, really direct
commentator with--and this is

00:33:25.996 --> 00:33:29.159
all-important;
you almost need a drum roll

00:33:29.159 --> 00:33:31.180
here--he has a sense of humor.
 

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.509
John Adams has a sense of humor.
 

00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:36.367
It's not every day that you
find a Founder with a sense of

00:33:36.367 --> 00:33:36.769
humor.
 

00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:38.118
[laughs] I can vouch.
 

00:33:38.118 --> 00:33:39.950
There aren't a lot of chuckling
Founders.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:42.915
Certainly on paper there's not
a lot of chuckling going on

00:33:42.915 --> 00:33:44.009
among the Founders.
 

00:33:44.009 --> 00:33:46.862
Probably in person there was,
but on paper not a lot of them

00:33:46.862 --> 00:33:48.990
commit humor to paper and John
Adams does.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:50.920
He's even self-deprecating
sometimes,

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.300
which--Nobody wants to be
self-deprecating on paper when

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.380
they know that they're going to
be a Founder,

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.037
but John Adams sometimes is,
and I'm going to offer one

00:33:58.037 --> 00:33:59.278
little,
tiny dumb example,

00:33:59.278 --> 00:34:01.730
the first thing that popped in
to my mind when I thought,

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:04.406
'well, what am I going to say
to show John Adams' sense of

00:34:04.406 --> 00:34:04.828
humor?'
 

00:34:04.828 --> 00:34:08.440
So this is actually from that
same series of letters in their

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.050
old age when they're writing
back and forth to each other.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.501
So Adams is writing to
Jefferson and he signs his

00:34:14.501 --> 00:34:16.543
letter with this:
"John Adams in the

00:34:16.543 --> 00:34:19.719
eighty-ninth year of his age,
too fat to last much

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:21.376
longer,"
[laughter]

00:34:21.376 --> 00:34:24.039
which is not typical Founder
talk.

00:34:24.039 --> 00:34:26.099
[laughs]
George Washington is not

00:34:26.099 --> 00:34:30.222
signing his letters that way but
Adams commits that sort of stuff

00:34:30.222 --> 00:34:31.059
to paper.
 

00:34:31.059 --> 00:34:33.896
What that means is not only is
he blunt, direct,

00:34:33.896 --> 00:34:37.155
and intelligent but he also
even gets to be humorous as

00:34:37.155 --> 00:34:37.699
well.
 

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:40.539
So in Adams we have this sort
of cantankerous,

00:34:40.539 --> 00:34:44.260
sometimes bemused,
more often irritated,

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:46.809
occasionally self-aware,
sometimes really not,

00:34:46.809 --> 00:34:50.300
stubborn, book-steeped,
event-experiencing,

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.449
action-taking tour guide.
 

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:54.869
He's not going to be there all
the time.

00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:57.134
There are going to be long
stretches of the course where we

00:34:57.134 --> 00:34:59.516
don't find John Adams but he's
definitely going to make repeat

00:34:59.516 --> 00:35:01.255
appearances,
and in the middle of the course

00:35:01.255 --> 00:35:03.300
he'll even get to tell a really
good story which he actually

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.485
basically wrote down and said,
"Let me tell you this

00:35:05.485 --> 00:35:05.989
story."
 

00:35:05.989 --> 00:35:08.728
So that's--As a historian,
what's better than historical

00:35:08.728 --> 00:35:11.320
characters doing exactly what
you want them to do?

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.150
'Here's a cool story on the
Revolution.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:17.969
You can quote it in your
lecture courses.' [laughter]

00:35:17.969 --> 00:35:20.920
Oh, and this actually makes me
think of another John

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.871
Adams-related thing before I get
to tip number five,

00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:25.260
which I will get to.
 

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.398
Partly I'm curious about this
and partly I want to mention

00:35:27.398 --> 00:35:27.849
something.
 

00:35:27.849 --> 00:35:32.960
How many of you saw the HBO
mini-series on John Adams?

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.630
Okay, a goodly number of you.
 

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:38.400
I mention that for a specific
reason.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.393
Now I will say I of course
watched it and the period when

00:35:41.393 --> 00:35:44.119
it was airing was a really
interesting period for me

00:35:44.119 --> 00:35:47.434
because as an eighteenth-century
historian this may be the only

00:35:47.434 --> 00:35:50.909
time I've ever been culturally
relevant to popular culture.

00:35:50.909 --> 00:35:52.661
[laughter]
I was like: it's my moment.

00:35:52.661 --> 00:35:53.039
Right?
 

00:35:53.039 --> 00:35:55.135
People are coming up to me and
saying, "I've got a

00:35:55.135 --> 00:35:56.378
question about John Adams."
 

00:35:56.378 --> 00:35:56.650
Wow.
 

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.329
[laughter] This is great.
 

00:35:59.329 --> 00:36:01.443
So it was an interesting moment
when people actually were

00:36:01.443 --> 00:36:04.362
thinking about John Adams,
and I will say also I watched

00:36:04.362 --> 00:36:08.197
it with a few historians and we
were prepared to throw popcorn

00:36:08.197 --> 00:36:11.782
at the screen and we ended up
pretty much liking it and we

00:36:11.782 --> 00:36:13.039
were surprised.
 

00:36:13.039 --> 00:36:15.389
About halfway through we all
looked at each other and said,

00:36:15.389 --> 00:36:17.010
"It's actually pretty
good."

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.746
So I don't--I mean,
of course there are always

00:36:18.746 --> 00:36:21.021
things that any kind of TV or
movie production about history

00:36:21.021 --> 00:36:24.114
gets wrong,
so I won't say that there's

00:36:24.114 --> 00:36:26.039
nothing wrong in it.
 

00:36:26.039 --> 00:36:28.190
However, there is one thing
that is wrong and I'm going to

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.454
mention it because if you have
pictures in your mind from the

00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:32.681
mini-series as you sit here in
this course it could be a bad

00:36:32.681 --> 00:36:34.380
thing to think that they are
accurate,

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.619
and what I'm talking about is
actually the--

00:36:36.619 --> 00:36:41.010
I think it's the first episode.
 

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.264
It is of course the first
episode, and that's the episode

00:36:43.264 --> 00:36:45.318
where the Revolution is
beginning and you see people

00:36:45.318 --> 00:36:46.606
milling about sort of with
fists.

00:36:46.606 --> 00:36:47.090
Right?
 

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:48.239
That represents the Revolution.
 

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:49.780
You see the beginning of the
Revolution.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.271
The bizarre thing about the way
that they depict it is

00:36:52.271 --> 00:36:55.139
apparently according to the
producers of this mini-series,

00:36:55.139 --> 00:36:57.974
if there was something
happening in the early stages of

00:36:57.974 --> 00:37:01.429
the Revolution,
John Adams apparently was there.

00:37:01.429 --> 00:37:03.550
Boy, they're shooting at
Lexington and Concord.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:06.115
Adams races across the
countryside [laughter]

00:37:06.115 --> 00:37:08.099
to get to Lexington and
Concord.

00:37:08.099 --> 00:37:10.739
Boston Massacre--John Adams
staring at the--

00:37:10.739 --> 00:37:13.534
[laughter]
Well, the idea is really that

00:37:13.534 --> 00:37:16.760
John Adams somehow is never off
his horse,

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.590
riding around Massachusetts
trying to be an eyewitness to

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.409
every [laughter]
historical event.

00:37:21.409 --> 00:37:24.239
Now I understand that probably
the people who made this

00:37:24.239 --> 00:37:27.123
thought: how the heck are we
going to communicate Boston

00:37:27.123 --> 00:37:29.010
Massacre, Lexington and Concord?
 

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.367
This is a film about Adams and
we can't say,

00:37:30.367 --> 00:37:32.327
"Put Adams over here while
we now turn to random people on

00:37:32.327 --> 00:37:33.179
a field shooting."
 

00:37:33.179 --> 00:37:35.519
[laughter]
So I understand narrative-wise

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:38.621
why they needed to do this,
but Adams was not at every

00:37:38.621 --> 00:37:41.840
historical event [laughs]
in the Revolutionary War.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.222
He was at many and he
definitely had an insider's view

00:37:45.222 --> 00:37:48.478
of the Boston Massacre,
but he was not everywhere in

00:37:48.478 --> 00:37:49.371
Massachusetts.
 

00:37:49.371 --> 00:37:50.010
Okay.
 

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:55.367
That oddly enough brings me to
tip number five in the Freeman

00:37:55.367 --> 00:38:00.190
Guide, and tip number five is:
remember contingency.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:03.750
Again, an obvious thing but
something we don't think about.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.420
People at the time didn't know
what was going to happen,

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.806
so Adams could not race to
places where he didn't know the

00:38:09.806 --> 00:38:11.858
things that happened yet:
"Something might be

00:38:11.858 --> 00:38:13.239
happening at Lexington."
 

00:38:13.239 --> 00:38:15.329
People didn't know what was
going to happen.

00:38:15.329 --> 00:38:19.072
Think for a moment about all of
the things that we assume about

00:38:19.072 --> 00:38:20.099
the Revolution.
 

00:38:20.099 --> 00:38:23.934
We assume that the colonists
were right and that the British

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:24.780
were wrong.
 

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.719
We assume that a Revolution was
inevitable.

00:38:27.719 --> 00:38:31.251
We assume that there was broad
agreement at any one time about

00:38:31.251 --> 00:38:32.409
what should be done.
 

00:38:32.409 --> 00:38:32.929
Right?
 

00:38:32.929 --> 00:38:34.440
Of course we need to declare
independence.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.650
Of course the colonists are
going to win the war.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:40.719
Of course there should be a
national union.

00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:44.704
Those are all the sorts of
things that I think we do assume

00:38:44.704 --> 00:38:48.079
and that's a lot of assumptions;
that's a lot of "of

00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:49.945
courses,"
but in fact it's important to

00:38:49.945 --> 00:38:52.590
remember that people didn't know
what was going to happen.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:55.824
You really need to allow for
contingency because literally

00:38:55.824 --> 00:38:58.380
what they assumed was:
anything can happen.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.518
Anything can happen.
 

00:39:00.518 --> 00:39:03.556
Again one of the things that I
love about this time period is

00:39:03.556 --> 00:39:05.480
that the emotions are so
heightened.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:08.016
If you're in an atmosphere
where everything's up in the air

00:39:08.016 --> 00:39:10.597
and you're in the middle of a
revolution or you're trying to

00:39:10.597 --> 00:39:12.958
create a government and you
literally don't know what's

00:39:12.958 --> 00:39:14.840
coming next and anything can
happen,

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.639
'maybe I'll get hanged by the
king,

00:39:18.639 --> 00:39:22.356
maybe I'll get shot going home,
maybe America will hate the

00:39:22.356 --> 00:39:26.010
Constitution so much they will
throw rocks at my head.'

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.920
I mean, I don't know what they
were thinking -- 'maybe the

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.730
Constitution will last four days
and then collapse.'

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:32.251
Whatever they're thinking,
the fact is because they

00:39:32.251 --> 00:39:34.219
literally think anything can
happen,

00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:36.920
anything could fall apart at
any second,

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.056
the emotions are really raised
and it's why a lot of the

00:39:40.056 --> 00:39:42.340
rhetoric in this period is so
extreme.

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.050
It's not that these guys are
trying to be dramatic.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:47.717
They actually are dramatic;
they're feeling that this is a

00:39:47.717 --> 00:39:50.182
dramatic kind of a moment,
and I don't think you get that

00:39:50.182 --> 00:39:52.547
sense,
I don't think you get that idea

00:39:52.547 --> 00:39:55.500
unless you remind yourself about
contingency,

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.954
about the fact that there are
no predetermined outcomes and

00:39:59.954 --> 00:40:02.030
that anything can happen.
 

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:04.123
I think particularly when
you're studying a revolution

00:40:04.123 --> 00:40:06.059
it's really important to
remember contingency,

00:40:06.059 --> 00:40:09.440
and we will discover what
contingency means in this time

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.960
period over the course of the
semester.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.199
And I will end there.
 

00:40:13.199 --> 00:40:16.110
I will see many of you perhaps
on Thursday.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:20.059
I will probably know next week
better about the reality of when

00:40:20.059 --> 00:40:22.800
we'll be meeting for discussion
sections.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:28.000

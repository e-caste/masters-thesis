00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.770
Prof: What is a Gospel
and how should we read it?

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.189
Popular opinion may think that
the Gospels are biographies of

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.651
Jesus, but they're not
biographies, at least not

00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:16.230
anything like the modern sense.
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.917
We don't get much of a personal
portrait of Jesus from the

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:21.740
Gospels.
 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.131
We don't know anything about
how he developed,

00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:27.054
how he went from being an
obnoxious teenager to being an

00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:28.330
apocalyptic prophet.
 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.840
We don't know about his
relationship to his parents,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.354
his brothers and sisters,
we don't know all kinds of

00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:39.557
things that a modern biography
would automatically be expected

00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:40.660
to tell you.
 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.960
The Gospels aren't biographies.
 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.884
Somebody once said,
a scholar once called Mark,

00:00:46.884 --> 00:00:50.190
a passion narrative with an
extended introduction.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.250
What's a passion narrative?
 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.634
Passion comes from the Latin
passio which doesn't mean

00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:57.449
just desire,
it could mean that in the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.741
ancient world,
but it also means

00:00:58.741 --> 00:00:59.650
"suffering."
 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.497
"Suffering"
is what passio means and

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:08.010
so it's the suffering of Jesus
that happens at his arrest,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.328
his trial, his crucifixion,
and then the resurrection.

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:14.316
All of that's part of what
scholars call the passion

00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:15.019
narrative.
 

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:18.885
If you notice,
that occupies a huge part of

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:20.819
the Gospel of Mark.
 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.370
The Gospel of Mark is our
shortest Gospel that's in the

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.750
canon.
 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.367
It's only sixteen chapters,
of course the chapters and

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:29.084
verse numbers weren't there in
the original manuscripts,

00:01:29.084 --> 00:01:30.269
it was just written.
 

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:31.768
In fact, they didn't even
divide up words,

00:01:31.768 --> 00:01:33.230
and they have very little
punctuation.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.486
It was just one capital letter
after another,

00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:38.513
which is one of the reasons
that ancient tended to read text

00:01:38.513 --> 00:01:39.180
out loud.
 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.310
They didn't read silently to
themselves.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.638
One of the reasons is because
it's easier to read a text that

00:01:43.638 --> 00:01:46.162
had no word divisions,
it was all capital letters,

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:48.328
no punctuation,
it wasn't divided up into

00:01:48.328 --> 00:01:50.229
sentences,
it was much easier to read that

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.860
if you read it out loud to
yourself,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.300
so that's the way ancient
people read.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.681
We don't have chapter numbers
and verse divisions,

00:01:56.681 --> 00:02:00.683
those are all later creations
that came about in the Middle

00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:02.409
Ages in Christianity.
 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.938
By modern reckoning,
therefore, there are sixteen

00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:09.602
chapters in Mark,
that's the shortest Gospel,

00:02:09.602 --> 00:02:12.573
and of that,
one-third of Mark is just the

00:02:12.573 --> 00:02:15.957
last week of Jesus' life,
the passion narrative part of

00:02:15.957 --> 00:02:16.188
it.
 

00:02:16.188 --> 00:02:18.615
As this scholar said,
Mark is really a passion

00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:20.878
narrative with an extended
introduction.

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:23.098
Notice what you get if you have
an outline of Mark.

00:02:23.098 --> 00:02:25.712
Chapter 1, verse 1 is the
title, "the

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:29.090
euangelion,"
or "the gospel according

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.639
to Jesus Christ,"
and it doesn't say

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.400
"according to Mark"
in the title because that name

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.930
was added later.
 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.240
That's the title of the book.
 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.697
Then for the next few verses
from 1:2, that is Chapter 1,

00:02:41.697 --> 00:02:44.846
verse 2 to verse 13,
you get an initial introduction

00:02:44.846 --> 00:02:47.440
to Jesus, just a little bit
about him.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.173
Then from 1:14 to 9:50,
so nine chapters is Jesus'

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.323
Galilean ministry,
his healings,

00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:58.348
his teachings,
his traveling around,

00:02:58.348 --> 00:03:01.411
his miracles that all take
place in Galilee which is where

00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:02.110
he is from.
 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.866
That's of course the northern
part of Palestine,

00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:08.330
whereas, Judea is down in the
southern part of Palestine.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.033
Then Chapters 11 through 15 are
all just the last week in

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:16.983
Jerusalem, again,
five chapters just on his last

00:03:16.983 --> 00:03:17.740
week.
 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.270
Then Chapter 16:1-8 is rumors
of the resurrection.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.520
Why do I say rumors of the
resurrection?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.098
Because if you'll notice in the
Gospel of Mark,

00:03:29.098 --> 00:03:32.305
if Mark ends at Chapter 16:8,
and there has been some

00:03:32.305 --> 00:03:36.250
controversy about whether it
really is supposed to end there,

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.120
but in most of your modern
editions it ends at 16:8.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.418
If that's true,
you don't actually see the

00:03:41.418 --> 00:03:42.538
resurrected Jesus.
 

00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:45.750
You just get--he doesn't appear
on the stage so to speak.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.491
You only get reports that he
has been raised,

00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:50.550
or one report that he's raised.
 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.598
Then the women are told by this
young man,

00:03:53.598 --> 00:03:56.803
who's sitting at the tomb,
probably supposed to represent

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:58.550
an angel,
to go and tell the other

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.378
disciples that he's raised and
he'll go before them to Galilee.

00:04:01.378 --> 00:04:03.610
Notice the women don't tell
them, it says that the women

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.908
were afraid and they ran away.
 

00:04:04.908 --> 00:04:08.574
You don't even get many reports
about Jesus' resurrection in

00:04:08.574 --> 00:04:10.394
Mark;
you just get the one young man

00:04:10.394 --> 00:04:12.840
at the tomb telling the women
that he's been raised.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.694
A huge bulk of the book tells
us about the last week of Jesus'

00:04:16.694 --> 00:04:19.120
life,
and even in the previous ten

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.194
chapters of the book,
you have Jesus talking about

00:04:23.194 --> 00:04:25.509
his upcoming crucifixion.
 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.927
These passion predictions,
we call them,

00:04:27.927 --> 00:04:31.214
that occur in the Gospel,
you have several of those in

00:04:31.214 --> 00:04:32.639
the Gospel of Mark.
 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.550
There are several references to
Jesus' upcoming death.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.714
That focuses our attention even
more on the last part of the

00:04:38.714 --> 00:04:39.089
book.
 

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:40.740
Is that important?
 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.595
Does that tell us anything
about what sort of thing Mark's

00:04:44.595 --> 00:04:47.029
Gospel is if it's not a
biography?

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.740
Let's look at the ending also.
 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.788
Mark 16, now remember,
I want you to bring your Bibles

00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:54.629
to class.
 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.990
Why do I want you to bring your
Bibles to class?

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.949
Yes?
 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:00.120
Student:  Because you're
going to lie.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.930
Prof: Because I will lie
to you.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.899
I may something that's not true
and you need to check me out,

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:07.778
de omnibus
dubitandum.

00:05:07.778 --> 00:05:09.735
When the sabbath was over [Mark
16]

00:05:09.735 --> 00:05:12.266
Mary Magdalene,
and Mary the mother of James,

00:05:12.266 --> 00:05:15.543
and Salome brought spices,
so that they might go an anoint

00:05:15.543 --> 00:05:16.120
him.
 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.894
And very early on the first day
of the week, when the sun had

00:05:18.894 --> 00:05:20.329
risen, they went to the tomb.
 

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:22.242
They had been saying to one
another, "Who will roll

00:05:22.242 --> 00:05:24.329
away the stone for us from the
entrance to the tomb?"

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:25.990
When they looked up,
they say that the stone,

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.990
which was very large,
had already been rolled back.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.646
As they entered the tomb,
they saw a young man,

00:05:30.646 --> 00:05:33.709
dressed in a white robe,
sitting on the right side;

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:34.940
and they were alarmed.
 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.949
But he said to them,
"Do not be alarmed;

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.259
you are looking for Jesus of
Nazareth, who was crucified.

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:40.740
He has been raised;
he is not here.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.879
Look, there is the place they
laid him.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.641
But go, tell his disciples and
Peter that he is going ahead of

00:05:46.641 --> 00:05:48.908
you to Galilee;
there you will see him,

00:05:48.908 --> 00:05:50.339
just as he told you."
 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:53.158
So they went out and fled from
the tomb, for terror and

00:05:53.158 --> 00:05:56.560
amazement had seized them;
and they said nothing to anyone

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.940
for they were afraid.
 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.021
Now you'll notice there's--and
maybe some of your Bible's there

00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:03.060
will be a paragraph under that
titled,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.649
"A Shorter Ending of
Mark."

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:07.961
All that had been commanded of
them they briefly told to those

00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:08.528
around Peter.
 

00:06:08.528 --> 00:06:10.562
And afterwards Jesus himself
sent out through them,

00:06:10.562 --> 00:06:12.394
from east to west,
the sacred and imperishable

00:06:12.394 --> 00:06:13.939
proclamation of eternal
salvation.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.000
Then you'll notice there's
maybe a few paragraphs,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.185
called by your editors,
"The Longer Ending of

00:06:19.185 --> 00:06:20.970
Mark," and it has several
verses.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.500
I'm not going to bother to read
that to you,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.278
but if you look at that,
the little incidents--

00:06:25.278 --> 00:06:28.182
several of the incidents in
that longer ending of Mark could

00:06:28.182 --> 00:06:30.889
sound familiar to you if you
know the other Gospels,

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.240
how they end.
 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.774
What scholars now believe is
that probably the Gospel of Mark

00:06:36.774 --> 00:06:39.269
really did end at Chapter 16:8.
 

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:41.605
Some people said,
well that's no way end a book,

00:06:41.605 --> 00:06:44.538
the women don't tell anything,
it just says they were afraid

00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:46.180
and they ran away,
that's it.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.728
Even the Greek that it ends in
is a very short little sentence

00:06:49.728 --> 00:06:52.230
that's an odd way to end a book
in Greek.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.817
Some people--scholars have said
well maybe that wasn't

00:06:55.817 --> 00:06:58.711
originally the ending,
maybe Mark was writing along

00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:01.329
and he got to 16 and he fell
over an died of a heart attack.

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:05.497
Or maybe he left the manuscript
out and some mice ate the end of

00:07:05.497 --> 00:07:09.137
it, because you roll up the
scroll and you just have the

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.189
leftover parts at the back.
 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:14.490
Or maybe it got in a fire and
burnt, maybe the last few

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.180
verses--the last part of the
Gospel burnt.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.375
Obviously ancient people had
the same sense of uneasiness

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:22.627
with the way--
with Mark ending at 16:8 and

00:07:22.627 --> 00:07:25.446
what you've got in that shorter
ending and the longer ending

00:07:25.446 --> 00:07:27.310
were later compositions of
scribes,

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.377
Christian scribes,
who thought you can't end

00:07:29.377 --> 00:07:31.925
Mark's Gospel that way,
so they made up those other

00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:34.901
verses and they put them at the
end of the manuscript they were

00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:35.430
copying.
 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.728
Because you remember before
printing presses all manuscripts

00:07:38.728 --> 00:07:42.129
had to be made one by one,
by somebody sitting down with a

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:44.449
quill,
and ink, and a papyrus and just

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:47.858
copying it word by word,
so other scribes when copying

00:07:47.858 --> 00:07:50.089
this over must have added that
on.

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:52.509
In fact that looks very much
like the longer ending,

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:56.519
it was scribes who knew some
events from the Gospels,

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:58.740
and they took some events from
Matthew,

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.899
Luke, and John,
and they stuck them into a

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:04.185
little paragraph and they said,
well that must be the way Mark

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.930
really intended to end his
Gospel.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.776
In the twentieth century,
basically, modern scholars have

00:08:08.776 --> 00:08:11.420
come to pretty much reject most
of those theories.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.644
At least we take the Gospel of
Mark as ending at 16:8,

00:08:15.644 --> 00:08:17.319
even intentionally.
 

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:21.605
But if you do that then you
still have to explain why end a

00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:24.672
Gospel this way,
it's not a normal way to end a

00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:26.271
book,
and it's not the way the other

00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:27.079
Gospels end at all.
 

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:31.259
The very ending of Mark is one
of the problems of the text that

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:34.090
scholars feel like we have to
deal with.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.260
This all demonstrates though
that scholars don't read the

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.730
Gospels as biographies or as
even straightforward accounts of

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:43.548
events.
 

00:08:43.548 --> 00:08:46.765
Last time I tried to show you
how you can't take the Book of

00:08:46.765 --> 00:08:49.546
Acts and Paul's letters as
simply being a historical

00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:52.888
description of what happened,
because each of these documents

00:08:52.888 --> 00:08:54.207
had agendas,
these authors had

00:08:54.207 --> 00:08:55.808
things--points they wanted to
get across.

00:08:55.808 --> 00:09:00.836
We learn to read these Gospels
in twentieth century by using

00:09:00.836 --> 00:09:03.990
the method of historical
criticism.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.174
The criticism part of that
doesn't mean necessarily being

00:09:07.174 --> 00:09:09.726
critical of it,
that is criticizing the text,

00:09:09.726 --> 00:09:12.149
it just means reading it with
critical eyes,

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:14.590
with questioning eyes,
with, if you were,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.100
doubting eyes in some cases.
 

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.457
What we do is we read these
texts not for what they tell us

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:21.154
about the events in the past,
although you can read this,

00:09:21.154 --> 00:09:24.049
but we actually read the text
as if they were intentional

00:09:24.049 --> 00:09:27.254
documents written by authors who
had points they wanted to make

00:09:27.254 --> 00:09:30.511
and they tell the story the way
they tell the story because they

00:09:30.511 --> 00:09:31.649
have a message.
 

00:09:31.649 --> 00:09:34.434
The important thing is not what
really happened or what lies

00:09:34.434 --> 00:09:37.080
behind the text for modern
scholars most of the time,

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.990
unless you're doing historical
Jesus research,

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.009
and I'll lecture about that at
one period later.

00:09:42.009 --> 00:09:44.971
But most of the time we're
saying, what did Mark as an

00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:46.090
author want to do?
 

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.533
Therefore we say,
why would end the Gospel this

00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:49.649
way if he did that?
 

00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:52.470
Now that's--notice this
historical critical method,

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.950
which is what I'm teaching in
this class,

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.460
is somewhat different from
several other ways of reading

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:56.779
text.
 

00:09:56.779 --> 00:09:59.697
I'm not implying by this that
historical critical method is

00:09:59.697 --> 00:10:02.767
the correct method or will give
you the correct meaning of the

00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:03.220
text.
 

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.400
I believe that it's perfectly
legitimate for Christians,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.600
for example,
to read these texts to get

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.840
something religious out of the
text for their lives.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.678
For personal guidance,
for doctrine,

00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:16.254
for images of Jesus,
to help their relationship to

00:10:16.254 --> 00:10:17.200
God, whatever.
 

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.530
That's a perfectly legitimate
way, in my view,

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.759
to read a text,
to read it theologically.

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:24.543
But a theological reading of
the text is not the same thing

00:10:24.543 --> 00:10:26.798
as a historical critical reading
of the text.

00:10:26.798 --> 00:10:29.354
The historian is what I'm
playing my role here in this

00:10:29.354 --> 00:10:29.740
class.
 

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.798
I don't care whether these
texts have anything theological

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:34.730
to say to you or to me
personally.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.018
What I care about is what kind
of theological message was this

00:10:38.018 --> 00:10:40.822
original writer intending to
give, and to whom was he

00:10:40.822 --> 00:10:42.168
intending to give it?
 

00:10:42.168 --> 00:10:45.020
The theological way to reading
is one way, perfectly fine way,

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.779
but it's not the historical
critical reading necessarily.

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:51.216
There are also literary ways of
reading these texts and this has

00:10:51.216 --> 00:10:54.326
been a very common thing in
English departments for people

00:10:54.326 --> 00:10:56.889
to write an account of the
Gospel of Mark,

00:10:56.889 --> 00:11:00.677
it's been a particularly
significant Gospel for modern

00:11:00.677 --> 00:11:05.110
literary people to retell or
talk about the Gospel of Mark,

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.668
do a literary reading of it.
 

00:11:06.668 --> 00:11:09.335
There they're looking for
things like the plot of it,

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.178
the way it accomplishes its
story.

00:11:11.178 --> 00:11:14.248
Are there figures and
characters, and what kind of

00:11:14.248 --> 00:11:16.690
thing does this character
represent,

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.706
or what kind of thing does this
event represent symbolically or

00:11:19.706 --> 00:11:20.340
literarily.
 

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.073
Just as you know how to do a
literary reading of a novel,

00:11:24.073 --> 00:11:28.408
some modern scholars will do a
literary reading of the Gospels.

00:11:28.408 --> 00:11:30.288
It's a perfectly legitimate way
to read the Gospels;

00:11:30.288 --> 00:11:32.278
it's just not the one that I'm
going to concentrate on in this

00:11:32.278 --> 00:11:32.538
class.
 

00:11:32.538 --> 00:11:34.049
There are many others,
you could say,

00:11:34.049 --> 00:11:35.476
I'm going to do a
deconstructionist

00:11:35.476 --> 00:11:38.120
post-structuralist reading of
Mark and they have been done.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.298
You can go buy books that have
done it.

00:11:40.298 --> 00:11:42.332
You can do a structuralist
reading of Mark,

00:11:42.332 --> 00:11:44.269
and those are the dullest ones
of all.

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:47.107
Lots of different ways to read
these texts and I'm going to

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:49.163
teach you this historical
critical reading,

00:11:49.163 --> 00:11:50.678
which means certain things.
 

00:11:50.678 --> 00:11:53.535
It means we're not going to
read the Gospel of Mark through

00:11:53.535 --> 00:11:55.308
the lens of Matthew,
Luke or John.

00:11:55.308 --> 00:11:58.600
We're going to take Mark's own
Gospel as standing on its own.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.975
So we're not going to rush off
to another Gospel,

00:12:00.975 --> 00:12:03.302
or to Acts, or the letters of
Paul to provide an

00:12:03.302 --> 00:12:05.528
interpretative clue for how to
read Mark.

00:12:05.528 --> 00:12:08.649
We're going to read Mark as
Mark by itself,

00:12:08.649 --> 00:12:11.226
and that's one of the
fundamental rules of historical

00:12:11.226 --> 00:12:14.200
criticism is don't harmonize
different texts in the Bible.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.840
Take them each individually.
 

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.428
Another one is you have to
avoid anachronism that is you

00:12:19.428 --> 00:12:23.476
can't attribute a meaning to the
text of Mark that doesn't make

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:26.740
sense in the first century in
his own context.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.399
For example,
if you're a Christian,

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:31.232
you're going to read some of
the Psalms in the Hebrew Bible

00:12:31.232 --> 00:12:33.918
as being about Jesus,
probably, most Christians do.

00:12:33.918 --> 00:12:36.971
When the Psalmist says,
"The Lord said to my Lord,

00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:39.969
Sit at my right hand and I will
make your enemies your

00:12:39.969 --> 00:12:41.100
footstool."
 

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.023
Christians have traditionally
said the first "Lord"

00:12:45.023 --> 00:12:47.131
there is God,
and the second "Lord"

00:12:47.131 --> 00:12:49.431
is Jesus,
and this is an Old Testament

00:12:49.431 --> 00:12:52.519
reference to God the Father and
God the Son.

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:56.542
This is a christological Psalm,
that's a theological way of

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:57.928
reading the Psalm.
 

00:12:57.928 --> 00:13:00.751
It doesn't pass the test of
historical criticism because

00:13:00.751 --> 00:13:03.421
historians will point out,
look the original Psalmist

00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:05.320
didn't know anything about
Jesus.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.740
He wasn't prophesying about
Jesus personally,

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.240
he was talking probably to the
David the King,

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.940
the Psalms meant to talk to
David, or to David's descendants

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.009
who sit on the throne of Judah.
 

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:20.850
Anachronism has to be avoided
in historical critical readings.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.083
There are several other kinds
of clues that you're doing a

00:13:23.083 --> 00:13:25.278
historical reading rather than a
theological reading,

00:13:25.278 --> 00:13:28.038
or a literary reading,
and you'll pick up on those as

00:13:28.038 --> 00:13:29.418
we go through the class.
 

00:13:29.418 --> 00:13:32.528
In fact, in your sections not
this time but next time,

00:13:32.528 --> 00:13:36.058
you will actually talk about
how to write an exegeses paper,

00:13:36.058 --> 00:13:39.431
because you'll all be writing
one, and your section leaders

00:13:39.431 --> 00:13:42.803
will lead you through this
method and try to get you to see

00:13:42.803 --> 00:13:43.850
how it's done.
 

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.668
If we're going to do that,
though,

00:13:45.668 --> 00:13:48.947
let's imagine what kind of
community this ancient guy we're

00:13:48.947 --> 00:13:51.347
going to call Mark,
we're going to continue to call

00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:53.291
him Mark even though we don't
believe that it was the

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:55.009
historical John Mark who wrote
the Gospel,

00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:56.881
but for convenience sake we'll
just call them the Gospel

00:13:56.881 --> 00:13:58.787
writers Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John for

00:13:58.787 --> 00:13:59.730
convenience sake.
 

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.970
What did Mark want to do with
this text?

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.610
Who did he want to do it with?
 

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.879
What kind of historical context
do we imagine?

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:10.658
First we see--immediately we
see a bunch of problems with

00:14:10.658 --> 00:14:11.470
this text.
 

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.614
There's first the problem--one
of the most famous problems of

00:14:14.614 --> 00:14:15.820
the Messianic secret.
 

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.990
This is when over and over
again in Mark,

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.432
and it happens sometimes in the
other Gospels,

00:14:20.432 --> 00:14:23.960
but it's--it happens more in
Mark then a lot of other places.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.972
You get Jesus doing something,
and then he tells somebody to

00:14:27.972 --> 00:14:30.490
be quiet about what he's just
done.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:34.942
Look in 1:25,
Mark 1:25, he's just cast--he's

00:14:34.942 --> 00:14:38.080
confronted an unclean spirit.
 

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.678
The unclean spirit cried out,
"What have you to do with

00:14:40.678 --> 00:14:42.970
us Jesus of Nazareth,
have you come to destroy us?

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.190
I know who you are,
the Holy One of God."

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.336
In other words,
the unclean spirit has just

00:14:47.336 --> 00:14:50.197
made a correct christological
confession according to the

00:14:50.197 --> 00:14:51.168
Gospel of Mark.
 

00:14:51.168 --> 00:14:54.325
"But Jesus rebuked him
saying, 'Be silent and come out

00:14:54.325 --> 00:14:54.870
of him.'
 

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.735
And the unclean spirit
convulsing and crying out with a

00:14:56.735 --> 00:14:57.980
loud voice, came out of
him."

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.720
Look at 1:34,
chapter 34 right below that,

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.513
"He cured many who were
sick with various diseases and

00:15:04.513 --> 00:15:07.528
cast out many demons,
but he would not permit the

00:15:07.528 --> 00:15:10.629
demons to speak because they
knew him."

00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:12.547
Wait a minute,
if Jesus is going around and

00:15:12.547 --> 00:15:15.196
we're supposed to think that
he's announcing that he is the

00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:17.331
Messiah,
the Christ, when people

00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:20.558
recognize this,
why doesn't he let them speak?

00:15:20.558 --> 00:15:22.330
Why does he tell them not to
speak?

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.244
He does with demons a lot,
but it's not just demons that

00:15:25.244 --> 00:15:28.000
he commands to silence,
he also does it to people.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.630
Look at 1:43,
"Immediately the leprosy

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.090
left him,"
this man at verse 42,

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.168
And he was made clean.
 

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:39.317
After sternly warning him,
he sent him away at once saying

00:15:39.317 --> 00:15:40.998
to him,
"See that you say nothing

00:15:40.998 --> 00:15:42.543
to anyone,
but go show yourself to the

00:15:42.543 --> 00:15:44.485
priest,
offer your cleansing what Moses

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:46.519
commanded as a testimony to
them."

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:50.720
It's a testimony to the fact
that he's now no longer a leper,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.149
but he tells the man,
don't tell anybody about the

00:15:54.149 --> 00:15:54.990
miracle.
 

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:59.245
Now 5:53, also notice what
happens right below that in

00:15:59.245 --> 00:16:01.437
verse 45,
But he went out [the man did]

00:16:01.437 --> 00:16:04.020
and began to proclaim it freely
and to spread the word so that

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.561
Jesus could no longer go into a
town openly but stayed out in

00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:09.058
the country and people came to
Him from every quarter.

00:16:09.058 --> 00:16:12.211
So Jesus does some great act,
he tells the person--the demon

00:16:12.211 --> 00:16:13.975
or the person,
don't tell anybody,

00:16:13.975 --> 00:16:16.539
the person goes out and tells
people anyway.

00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:17.928
It's a pattern.
 

00:16:17.928 --> 00:16:21.202
This is what we call--one of
the old theories about the

00:16:21.202 --> 00:16:24.778
Messianic secret was a modern
scholar in the early twentieth

00:16:24.778 --> 00:16:27.399
century said,
well here's what happened,

00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:29.866
the disciples of Jesus,
they say the writer of the

00:16:29.866 --> 00:16:31.917
Gospel of Mark,
knew that Jesus wasn't

00:16:31.917 --> 00:16:35.726
proclaimed openly and widely as
the Messiah during Jesus' own

00:16:35.726 --> 00:16:36.490
lifetime.
 

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.260
He was proclaimed as the
Messiah by Jesus' disciples

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.240
after his death.
 

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.943
Why didn't all these people
recognize Jesus was the Messiah

00:16:43.943 --> 00:16:45.350
during his lifetime?
 

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.789
This scholar said,
well the writer of the Gospel

00:16:47.789 --> 00:16:50.697
of Mark decided it must have
been because Jesus kept it a

00:16:50.697 --> 00:16:51.269
secret.
 

00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:52.840
Jesus wanted to keep it a
secret.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.590
Now the problem with that
theory is?

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.759
Can you pick out the problem
with that theory?

00:16:57.759 --> 00:16:59.967
The reason we have the
Messianic secret in Mark is

00:16:59.967 --> 00:17:02.761
because people knew that Jesus
was not openly proclaimed as the

00:17:02.761 --> 00:17:05.990
Messiah during his lifetime,
so this was a literary device

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.528
to explain why Jesus wasn't
known in his lifetime is because

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:11.089
Jesus kept it a secret.
 

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.279
What's wrong with this theory?
 

00:17:12.279 --> 00:17:13.358
Yes, ma'am.
 

00:17:13.358 --> 00:17:18.250
Student:  That
&gt;

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.308
Prof: There's one place
where he does say,

00:17:19.308 --> 00:17:19.529
go tell.
 

00:17:19.529 --> 00:17:20.720
The binding of the strong man.
 

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.578
Other problems with the theory?
 

00:17:24.578 --> 00:17:26.368
Student: 
&gt;

00:17:26.368 --> 00:17:28.068
 Professor Dale Martin:
 The people tell anyway.

00:17:28.068 --> 00:17:30.634
It doesn't explain that Jesus
wasn't proclaimed the Messiah

00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:33.023
because all the people that he
tells to be quiet go and

00:17:33.023 --> 00:17:35.742
proclaim him anyway,
and he just says his fame

00:17:35.742 --> 00:17:36.259
spread.
 

00:17:36.259 --> 00:17:39.330
There have been a lot of other
theories about this Messianic

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:39.799
secret.
 

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:40.779
What does it mean?
 

00:17:40.779 --> 00:17:42.180
Why does he tell people to be
quiet?

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.430
What is it that he wants them
to keep quiet?

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.759
Why do they go tell about him
anyway?

00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:48.089
What does that mean for the
story?

00:17:48.089 --> 00:17:49.720
That's the first problem.
 

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.268
The second problem,
the problem of

00:17:51.268 --> 00:17:52.160
misunderstanding.
 

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:59.548
Look at Mark 2:16:
When the Scribes of the

00:17:59.548 --> 00:18:02.505
Pharisees saw that he was eating
with sinners and tax collectors

00:18:02.505 --> 00:18:04.950
they said to his disciples,
"Why does he eat with tax

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:05.940
collectors and sinners?"
 

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.180
When Jesus heard this he said
to them, "Those who are

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:08.809
well ..."
 

00:18:08.809 --> 00:18:09.900
Is that what I want to read?
 

00:18:14.108 --> 00:18:17.737
Well okay, look at 15:34,
I think I can make this point

00:18:17.737 --> 00:18:20.288
better with a couple of other
texts.

00:18:20.288 --> 00:18:23.790
The point I'm making is that
people tend to misunderstand

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.230
Jesus, his sayings,
and often events.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.724
"At three o'clockJesus
cried out with a loud voice

00:18:28.724 --> 00:18:30.871
[this is when he's crucified],
'Eloi, Eloi,

00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:32.890
lema sabachthani?'"
which means--

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.210
it's Aramaic--it means,
"My God,

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.730
my God, why have You forsaken
me?"

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.875
"When some of the
bystanders heard it they said,

00:18:38.875 --> 00:18:40.482
'Listen, he's calling for
Elijah.'"

00:18:40.482 --> 00:18:42.009
Well he's not calling for
Elijah;

00:18:42.009 --> 00:18:44.509
it's just that the word--the
Aramaic word eloi,

00:18:44.509 --> 00:18:46.210
eloi sounds like the
name Elijah,

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.859
so people standing around
misunderstand things that are

00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:49.450
happening.
 

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.009
It's not just people standing
around,

00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:54.808
the disciples--in Mark,
the disciples themselves,

00:18:54.808 --> 00:18:56.400
the people who are closest to
Jesus,

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.288
are the ones who get it wrong
the most.

00:18:59.288 --> 00:19:01.510
I hope you noticed this when
you were reading this text

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.453
before class,
is that, repeatedly,

00:19:03.453 --> 00:19:05.960
Jesus has to explain things to
Peter,

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.118
and James, and John,
his closest disciples.

00:19:08.118 --> 00:19:13.950
4:41, "He said to them,
'Why are you afraid?

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.321
Have you still no faith?'"
In other words,

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.172
they've already seen him do all
kinds of miracles by this point

00:19:17.172 --> 00:19:17.528
in Mark.
 

00:19:17.528 --> 00:19:20.297
"And they were filled with
great awe and said to one

00:19:20.297 --> 00:19:21.730
another, 'Who then is this?
 

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.445
That even the wind and the sea
obey Him?;'"

00:19:23.445 --> 00:19:25.307
Well we're the readers;
we're going,

00:19:25.307 --> 00:19:29.180
you learned that in the first
verse, Son of God.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:33.330
All the way through here Jesus
has been telling people what He

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.757
is,
or at least demons have and

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:36.529
other people and people have
been confessing,

00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:38.358
and yet the disciples don't
understand.

00:19:38.358 --> 00:19:42.613
6:52--now notice my point about
this is not to say that

00:19:42.613 --> 00:19:47.259
historically Jesus' disciples
actually didn't understand.

00:19:47.259 --> 00:19:50.266
We're not looking for what
happened, what we're looking for

00:19:50.266 --> 00:19:51.769
is the narrative structure.
 

00:19:51.769 --> 00:19:55.401
What kind of story the author
tells and why does he tell it

00:19:55.401 --> 00:19:56.088
this way.
 

00:19:56.088 --> 00:20:00.845
6:52, start reading at 51,
"Then He got out of the

00:20:00.845 --> 00:20:05.952
boat," this is when Jesus
is doing another kind of sea

00:20:05.952 --> 00:20:07.009
miracle.
 

00:20:07.009 --> 00:20:09.588
"He got out--into the boat
with them and the wind ceased,

00:20:09.588 --> 00:20:11.780
and they were utterly
astounded, for they did not

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.971
understand about the loaves but
their hearts were

00:20:13.971 --> 00:20:14.838
hardened."
 

00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:16.789
In other words,
Jesus had multiplied loaves and

00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:18.019
fishes in a previous scene.
 

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:21.528
They should have picked up on
that that he's somehow special.

00:20:21.528 --> 00:20:26.558
Somehow they didn't understand
what's special about Jesus.

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:30.838
It goes all the
way--7:18--8:17-21.

00:20:30.838 --> 00:20:33.140
Over and over again,
when you're studying Mark,

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.825
go through and mark the
different times when somebody

00:20:35.825 --> 00:20:39.078
gets it wrong even when they
should not have gotten it wrong.

00:20:39.078 --> 00:20:41.509
There are people who recognize
him.

00:20:41.509 --> 00:20:46.290
The first person who recognizes
Jesus in the Gospel of Mark is

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:49.596
you,
because the very first verse

00:20:49.596 --> 00:20:52.148
announces,
"The beginning of the good

00:20:52.148 --> 00:20:53.960
news," euangelion in
Greek,

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.910
meaning "good
announcement,

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.529
good news"
of Jesus Christ the Son of God.

00:20:57.529 --> 00:21:01.068
Now some manuscripts don't have
that verse quite like that,

00:21:01.068 --> 00:21:04.130
but if that's the original
wording of that verse,

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.910
you have been told from the
very first verse that Jesus is

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:07.740
the Son of God.
 

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.865
It's not a mystery to you the
reader, that's part of the fun

00:21:10.865 --> 00:21:13.568
of the Gospel--Mark and John
both play with this.

00:21:13.568 --> 00:21:15.962
They let you,
the reader in on certain kinds

00:21:15.962 --> 00:21:19.470
of jokes and puzzles that the
people in this story don't get.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.884
That's one of the things that
Mark is doing is letting you in

00:21:21.884 --> 00:21:23.921
on some things,
but still it's very difficult

00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:26.723
for us to figure out this whole
Messianic secret thing and this

00:21:26.723 --> 00:21:28.980
lack of understanding,
even though we've known the

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:29.298
secret.
 

00:21:29.298 --> 00:21:33.005
The last person to know who
Jesus is, and to recognize him

00:21:33.005 --> 00:21:36.710
and not to misunderstand is the
centurion at the cross.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:40.763
In 15:39, the Roman centurion,
when Jesus dies says this and

00:21:40.763 --> 00:21:44.818
I'll do it the way "The
Greatest Story Ever Told,"

00:21:44.818 --> 00:21:48.493
the movie--
this scene is played by John

00:21:48.493 --> 00:21:51.130
Wayne,
he's the Roman centurion.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.848
You don't really see John Wayne
clearly,

00:21:53.848 --> 00:21:55.970
you just see his shadow with
the sun coming in,

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:57.578
and Jesus has just died on the
cross,

00:21:57.578 --> 00:22:01.809
and then you hear this
over-voice, "Surely this

00:22:01.809 --> 00:22:04.049
was the Son of God."
 

00:22:04.049 --> 00:22:06.740
My John Wayne imitation for you.
 

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.987
The centurion,
though, recognizes that Jesus

00:22:08.987 --> 00:22:11.442
is the Son of God,
at least according--if that's

00:22:11.442 --> 00:22:12.750
the way we read that.
 

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:16.038
The other people who recognize
Jesus and understand are demons,

00:22:16.038 --> 00:22:17.630
at least they recognize him.
 

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.430
Now let's look at the turning
point in the Gospel,

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.808
and what I'm going to do is
show you how I,

00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:26.818
as a brilliant modern scholar
,have posed these problems,

00:22:26.818 --> 00:22:29.818
the Messianic secret problem,
the problem of misunderstanding

00:22:29.818 --> 00:22:32.365
and all this sort of thing,
and the problem of the ending

00:22:32.365 --> 00:22:34.554
which I'll get to in a minute,
and I'm going to make it all

00:22:34.554 --> 00:22:35.328
makes sense for you.
 

00:22:35.328 --> 00:22:37.901
There are other scholars who
might not think I'm so brilliant

00:22:37.901 --> 00:22:39.315
and might have other
explanations,

00:22:39.315 --> 00:22:41.328
but this one's mine and I'm
sticking to it.

00:22:41.328 --> 00:22:46.384
8:27--follow along with me,
in your hymnals,

00:22:46.384 --> 00:22:53.554
8:27 "Jesus went on with
his disciples to the villages of

00:22:53.554 --> 00:22:56.140
Caesarea Philippi.
 

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.740
And on the way he asked his
disciples,

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.424
'Who do people say that I
am?'" Nice little

00:23:00.424 --> 00:23:02.426
introduction,
you're smart readers,

00:23:02.426 --> 00:23:04.548
as soon as you get to this part
you go,

00:23:04.548 --> 00:23:07.730
okay we're getting to the
climax of this book,

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.634
because all the way through the
book up to this point we've had

00:23:10.634 --> 00:23:13.212
this issue of who is he,
who do people say he is,

00:23:13.212 --> 00:23:16.291
how do they understand him,
so your antennae should be

00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:19.678
picking up that this story is
going to be an important story

00:23:19.678 --> 00:23:20.308
for you.
 

00:23:20.308 --> 00:23:22.397
And they answered him,
"John the Baptist,

00:23:22.397 --> 00:23:24.486
and others Elijah,
and still others one of the

00:23:24.486 --> 00:23:25.088
prophets.
 

00:23:25.088 --> 00:23:27.556
He asked them,
"But who do you say that I

00:23:27.556 --> 00:23:28.160
am?"
 

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.296
Peter answered him,
"You are the

00:23:31.296 --> 00:23:32.690
Messiah."
 

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:36.440
He sternly ordered them not to
tell anyone about him.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.720
There it is again.
 

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.390
Peter confesses correctly,
"You are the

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.191
Messiah,"
and Jesus says,

00:23:42.191 --> 00:23:43.930
okay don't tell anybody.
 

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.390
Jesus is not a very good
evangelist, apparently.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.509
He's not Joel Olsteen or
whoever that guy is in Houston.

00:23:51.509 --> 00:23:53.462
He's not the kind who's
proclaiming it all out,

00:23:53.462 --> 00:23:55.289
at least according to the
Gospel of Mark.

00:23:55.289 --> 00:23:57.838
Then he began to teach them.
 

00:23:57.838 --> 00:23:59.880
Now wait a minute that might be
important.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.282
He just did this command to
silence, what does the next

00:24:03.282 --> 00:24:04.038
verse say?
 

00:24:04.038 --> 00:24:06.806
"Then he began to teach
them that the Son of Man must

00:24:06.806 --> 00:24:08.358
undergo great suffering."
 

00:24:08.358 --> 00:24:12.144
Then he began to teach
them, then he began to

00:24:12.144 --> 00:24:15.673
teach them--not before--"
Then He began to teach them

00:24:15.673 --> 00:24:18.269
that the Son of Man must undergo
great suffering,

00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:20.190
be rejected by the elders,
the chief priest,

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.711
the Scribes,
and be killed and after three

00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:23.819
days rise again.
 

00:24:23.819 --> 00:24:27.059
He said all this quite openly.
 

00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:29.588
Mark is a clever writer.
 

00:24:29.588 --> 00:24:32.609
He puts little short sentences
like this in his gospel at

00:24:32.609 --> 00:24:35.307
interesting places,
and you the reader are supposed

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:37.519
to go, okay he's talking right
to me.

00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:39.515
"He said this
openly,"

00:24:39.515 --> 00:24:42.281
it's not closed anymore,
this part's opened,

00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:44.019
this part's not closed.
 

00:24:44.019 --> 00:24:47.220
It's not going to be the end of
the problem.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.308
"Peter took him aside and
began to rebuke him.

00:24:49.308 --> 00:24:51.872
But turning and looking at his
disciples he rebuked

00:24:51.872 --> 00:24:52.588
Peter."
 

00:24:52.588 --> 00:24:54.423
Peter is of course saying
something like,

00:24:54.423 --> 00:24:55.661
"No, no,
no, no, Jesus,

00:24:55.661 --> 00:24:56.670
you didn't get it.
 

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.788
We just said you're the Messiah.
 

00:24:58.788 --> 00:25:01.778
The Messiah doesn't suffer and
die on a cross;

00:25:01.778 --> 00:25:04.588
the Messiah comes with angels
and rules the world.

00:25:04.588 --> 00:25:06.098
The Messiah overthrows the
Romans.

00:25:06.098 --> 00:25:08.382
The Messiah sets up the new
reconstituted Israel,

00:25:08.382 --> 00:25:10.759
and all the nations will flock
to Jerusalem now.

00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:12.470
You're the Messiah,
that's what you do.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:16.116
No, you don't suffer and die,
that's not what Messiah's

00:25:16.116 --> 00:25:16.858
do."
 

00:25:16.858 --> 00:25:20.730
There's no Jewish expectation
in the ancient world that the

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.798
Messiah would suffer and die.
 

00:25:22.798 --> 00:25:25.028
Modern Christians think,
well that's--

00:25:25.028 --> 00:25:26.640
of course it's all the way
through the Old Testament,

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.105
but those prophecies and
things, those statements and

00:25:29.105 --> 00:25:31.663
poems in the Old Testament,
they weren't taken to be about

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:33.818
the Messiah they were taken to
be about other prophets,

00:25:33.818 --> 00:25:35.990
or holy men of God who might
have to suffer,

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:37.210
who might be persecuted.
 

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.130
The Messiah passages don't have
suffering and death in them;

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:45.048
they just refer to this coming
King, the descendent of David.

00:25:45.048 --> 00:25:48.788
No Jews in the first century
this time expected that the

00:25:48.788 --> 00:25:50.759
Messiah would be crucified.
 

00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:53.338
It just was absolutely against
common sense.

00:25:53.338 --> 00:25:56.896
Messiahs don't suffer,
Messiahs aren't crucified,

00:25:56.896 --> 00:25:58.750
Messiahs aren't beaten.
 

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:04.015
Peter actually quite
understandably thinks that Jesus

00:26:04.015 --> 00:26:05.940
has got it wrong.
 

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.248
Peter says, You're the Messiah,
you're not going to be killed

00:26:09.248 --> 00:26:11.660
and suffer,
and that's when Jesus turns

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.819
around and rebukes Peter looking
at His disciples--

00:26:14.819 --> 00:26:15.990
is that an interesting clue?
 

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:19.019
that Jesus is looking at his
disciples and he rebukes Peter?

00:26:19.019 --> 00:26:23.837
"Get behind me,
Satan, for you are setting your

00:26:23.837 --> 00:26:28.940
mind not on divine things but on
human things."

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.630
That's a very interesting story
in itself.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:36.568
What is Jesus rebuking Peter
for and calling him Satan?

00:26:36.568 --> 00:26:39.910
He called the crowd with his
disciples,

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.904
and said to them,
"If any want to become my

00:26:43.904 --> 00:26:46.946
followers,
let them deny themselves and

00:26:46.946 --> 00:26:49.368
take up their cross and follow
me.

00:26:49.368 --> 00:26:52.498
For those who want to save
their life will lose it,

00:26:52.498 --> 00:26:56.315
and those who lose their life
for my sake, and for the sake of

00:26:56.315 --> 00:26:58.130
the gospel, will save it.
 

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.955
For what will it profit them to
gain the whole world and forfeit

00:27:00.955 --> 00:27:01.538
their life?
 

00:27:01.538 --> 00:27:05.259
Indeed, what can they give in
return for their life?

00:27:05.259 --> 00:27:08.132
Those who are ashamed of me and
of my words in this adulteress

00:27:08.132 --> 00:27:10.681
and sinful generation,
of them the Son of Man will

00:27:10.681 --> 00:27:13.680
also be ashamed when he comes in
the glory of his angels--

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.759
of his Father with the holy
angels."

00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:17.598
[That's what Messiah's were
expected to do,

00:27:17.598 --> 00:27:20.123
is come in glory with holy
angels.]

00:27:20.123 --> 00:27:23.336
And he said to them,
"Truly I tell you there

00:27:23.336 --> 00:27:26.619
are some standing here who will
not taste death until they see

00:27:26.619 --> 00:27:29.150
that the kingdom of God has come
with power.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:30.490
What's going on here?
 

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.957
You have the correct
identification of Jesus,

00:27:33.957 --> 00:27:37.108
even according to Mark as the
Messiah.

00:27:37.108 --> 00:27:39.769
You have the charge to secrecy
in 8:30;

00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:42.064
you have the passion
prediction--one of the passion

00:27:42.064 --> 00:27:44.910
predictions and the first of
several that we'll see in Mark.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.529
Jesus saying,
this is going to happen,

00:27:46.529 --> 00:27:49.621
and then you have this word,
"And he said this plainly

00:27:49.621 --> 00:27:52.180
and clearly to them,"
a nice little clue.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.618
Then you have Peter's
misunderstanding,

00:27:54.618 --> 00:27:56.930
but what does Peter
misunderstand?

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:57.950
That's what we'll ask.
 

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.308
What was Peter expecting
different?

00:28:00.308 --> 00:28:02.217
Well he was expecting the
Messiah to come with angels and

00:28:02.217 --> 00:28:02.660
triumphant.
 

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.037
Then you have an emphasis on
suffering that everybody has to

00:28:06.037 --> 00:28:07.961
suffer,
not just the Son of Man,

00:28:07.961 --> 00:28:11.457
but everybody has to suffer and
you have a prediction of future

00:28:11.457 --> 00:28:12.808
eschatological glory.
 

00:28:12.808 --> 00:28:16.336
Eschatology is just a fancy
theological word meaning the end

00:28:16.336 --> 00:28:18.490
times, the study of the end
times.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.441
Eschaton is just a Greek
word meaning "the

00:28:21.441 --> 00:28:22.108
end."
 

00:28:22.108 --> 00:28:29.343
You'll see this if you read
much about the Bible or ancient

00:28:29.343 --> 00:28:32.595
religion,
the eschaton will come up

00:28:32.595 --> 00:28:36.061
apocalyptic contexts,
and eschatology means any study

00:28:36.061 --> 00:28:39.288
or doctrine about the end of the
world as we know it.

00:28:39.288 --> 00:28:41.830
In fact I used to direct a
little singing group in the

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.230
Divinity School when I was a
grad student here,

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.500
and we called ourselves
"The Eschatones."

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:53.460
A joke that only divinity
students would get.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.977
The prediction of the
eschatological glory that comes

00:28:56.977 --> 00:29:00.020
after the suffering and then
right after that,

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.405
6:2:
Six days later,

00:29:01.405 --> 00:29:03.682
Jesus took with him Peter and
James and John,

00:29:03.682 --> 00:29:06.528
led them up to a high mountain
apart, by themselves.

00:29:06.528 --> 00:29:09.105
And he was transfigured before
them, and his clothes became

00:29:09.105 --> 00:29:11.058
dazzling white,
such as no one on earth could

00:29:11.058 --> 00:29:11.769
bleach them.
 

00:29:11.769 --> 00:29:14.505
And there appeared to them
Elijah with Moses,

00:29:14.505 --> 00:29:16.368
who were talking with Jesus.
 

00:29:16.368 --> 00:29:19.534
Then Peter said to Jesus,
"Rabbi it's good for us to

00:29:19.534 --> 00:29:21.559
be here;
let us make three dwellings

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:23.290
[three tabernacles,
three tents],

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:24.696
one for you,
one for Moses,

00:29:24.696 --> 00:29:26.318
and one for Elijah."
 

00:29:26.318 --> 00:29:28.430
He did not know what to say for
they were terrified.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.973
Then a cloud overshadowed them,
and from the cloud there came a

00:29:30.973 --> 00:29:32.740
voice, "This is my Son,
the Beloved;

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.048
listen to him!"
 

00:29:34.048 --> 00:29:36.795
Suddenly when they looked
around, they saw no one with

00:29:36.795 --> 00:29:38.348
them anymore but only Jesus.
 

00:29:38.348 --> 00:29:40.878
[The next verse:]
"As they were coming down

00:29:40.878 --> 00:29:43.624
the mountain,
he ordered them to tell no one

00:29:43.624 --> 00:29:46.863
what they had seen [--
again that secrecy motif--]

00:29:46.863 --> 00:29:49.920
until the Son of Man had risen
from the dead.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.630
And again an emphasis on death.
 

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:53.650
What's going on with all this?
 

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.702
What's going on is that Mark is
trying to make an important

00:29:56.702 --> 00:29:59.650
point, maybe even to his fellow
believers at the time.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:06.556
Apparently, what Peter doesn't
understand about Jesus is that

00:30:06.556 --> 00:30:10.930
Jesus has to suffer and has to
die,

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.740
and if that causes a
redefinition of Peter's notion

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.230
of what a Messiah is,
so be it.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:20.207
Peter needs to work with a
redefined notion of the Christ,

00:30:20.207 --> 00:30:22.788
the Messiah,
if he doesn't include the

00:30:22.788 --> 00:30:25.720
necessity of suffering in that
notion.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:30.490
Let's imagine the context for
this kind of message.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:34.108
The rapid fire style of Mark is
one of the--

00:30:34.108 --> 00:30:35.702
if you notice--did you notice
how many times

00:30:35.702 --> 00:30:37.000
"immediately"
is used,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.029
the word
"immediately"?

00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:41.002
The writer of the Gospel of
Mark needed a good Yale college

00:30:41.002 --> 00:30:43.942
editor or a writing tutor,
because there's kind of a rapid

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:45.372
fire,
it's not reading very good

00:30:45.372 --> 00:30:46.220
Greek style either.
 

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.268
It's rapid fire,
he says, immediately this

00:30:47.268 --> 00:30:48.828
happened, then immediately this
happened, and then immediately

00:30:48.828 --> 00:30:49.288
this happened.
 

00:30:49.288 --> 00:30:52.003
You get the idea reading the
Gospel of Mark that the

00:30:52.003 --> 00:30:54.878
narrative is pulling you along,
it's shoving you along,

00:30:54.878 --> 00:30:56.210
is rushing you along.
 

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:59.269
That's actually part of,
I think, this apocalyptic style

00:30:59.269 --> 00:31:02.662
of Mark, because the Gospel of
Mark is also apocalyptic in its

00:31:02.662 --> 00:31:03.328
message.
 

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:05.088
It talks about angels coming at
the end;

00:31:05.088 --> 00:31:07.755
it talks about a big war that's
going to happen,

00:31:07.755 --> 00:31:11.157
so you have demons and a battle
of Jesus with the strong man,

00:31:11.157 --> 00:31:12.858
another apocalyptic story.
 

00:31:12.858 --> 00:31:15.515
You have the emphasis on
suffering and persecution,

00:31:15.515 --> 00:31:18.170
and that's a common theme of
Jewish apocalyptic.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.775
Not that the Messiah would
suffer but that the Jews

00:31:20.775 --> 00:31:23.953
themselves might have to suffer
before the fabulous kingdom of

00:31:23.953 --> 00:31:24.838
the end time.
 

00:31:24.838 --> 00:31:27.763
Remember you saw it in Daniel,
when we read Daniel two classes

00:31:27.763 --> 00:31:29.910
ago,
Daniel predicts suffering for

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.123
the righteous,
and only after the suffering

00:31:32.123 --> 00:31:35.200
would you have the goodies,
heaven, the Kingdom of God.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.106
Now we'll look at Mark 13 and
we're going to analyze it pretty

00:31:38.106 --> 00:31:38.680
carefully.
 

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.130
Again some of these things will
come into play.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:45.902
The basic message I'm saying is
that people misunderstand about

00:31:45.902 --> 00:31:49.733
Jesus is that they misunderstand
the necessity of suffering that

00:31:49.733 --> 00:31:53.259
must be there before you--
must precede glory.

00:31:53.259 --> 00:31:56.345
Yes, God promises them glory,
they're going to be glorified

00:31:56.345 --> 00:31:58.596
in the end,
they're going to win in the

00:31:58.596 --> 00:32:01.720
end, but they have to go through
a period of suffering.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.160
Jesus is the first one who does
this,

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.069
he accepts suffering and death
before he himself is glorified

00:32:08.069 --> 00:32:10.892
but the glory will come,
it has to be preceded by

00:32:10.892 --> 00:32:11.380
suffering.
 

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.708
But Jesus also in Mark tells
the disciples over and over

00:32:13.708 --> 00:32:15.703
again,
you also will have to

00:32:15.703 --> 00:32:18.538
suffer first,
but if you endure you will

00:32:18.538 --> 00:32:20.279
experience glory also.
 

00:32:20.279 --> 00:32:24.700
Now look at Mark 13.
 

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.630
As he came out of the temple,
one of his disciples said to

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.884
Him,
"Look, Teacher,

00:32:28.884 --> 00:32:31.118
what large stones and what
large buildings!"

00:32:31.118 --> 00:32:33.698
Then Jesus asked him,
"Do you see these great

00:32:33.698 --> 00:32:34.328
buildings?
 

00:32:34.328 --> 00:32:37.019
Not one stone will be left here
upon another;

00:32:37.019 --> 00:32:38.470
all will be thrown down."
 

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.209
[He's predicting the
destruction of the temple in

00:32:41.209 --> 00:32:43.319
Jerusalem.]
When he was sitting on the

00:32:43.319 --> 00:32:45.660
Mount of Olives opposite the
temple,

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.571
Peter, James,
John, and Andrew asked him

00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:48.930
privately,
"Tell us,

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.230
when will this be,
and what will be the sign that

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.220
all these things are to be
accomplished?"

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.034
Then Jesus began to say to
them, "Beware that no one

00:32:56.034 --> 00:32:56.990
leads you astray.
 

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.410
Many will come in my name and
say, "I am he!"

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.880
and they will lead many astray.
 

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.151
False prophets,
Jesus predicts there will be

00:33:03.151 --> 00:33:05.316
false prophets,
maybe even false Messiahs,

00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:08.009
although he doesn't use that
term here in Mark.

00:33:08.009 --> 00:33:10.230
It will occur in other places.
 

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.028
When you hear of wars and
rumors of wars,

00:33:13.028 --> 00:33:15.632
do not be alarmed;
this must take place,

00:33:15.632 --> 00:33:17.348
but the end is still to come.
 

00:33:17.348 --> 00:33:20.288
So just when people have--when
times are bad and there are wars

00:33:20.288 --> 00:33:23.226
that's not necessarily the end
yet, you've got to have a few of

00:33:23.226 --> 00:33:23.700
those.
 

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.068
For nation will rise against
nation, kingdom against kingdom;

00:33:26.068 --> 00:33:27.359
there will be earthquakes in
various places;

00:33:27.359 --> 00:33:28.348
there will be famines.
 

00:33:28.348 --> 00:33:31.420
This is but the beginning of
the birth pangs.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.480
As for yourselves, beware;
for they will hand you over to

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.586
counsels;
and you will be beaten in

00:33:35.586 --> 00:33:35.960
synagogues.
 

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.328
Again this theme of suffering.
 

00:33:37.328 --> 00:33:39.108
You have all these terrible
cosmic events,

00:33:39.108 --> 00:33:42.058
terrible wars and disasters,
earthquakes and all that sort

00:33:42.058 --> 00:33:43.547
of thing,
but also he says,

00:33:43.547 --> 00:33:47.521
you're going to have to suffer;
they're going to hand you over

00:33:47.521 --> 00:33:48.848
for persecution.
 

00:33:48.848 --> 00:33:52.656
In 13:10, "And the good
news must first be proclaimed to

00:33:52.656 --> 00:33:55.828
all nations,"
so Jesus is predicting that,

00:33:55.828 --> 00:33:57.808
before the end comes,
his message,

00:33:57.808 --> 00:34:01.670
the Gospel message,
will be proclaimed all around.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:04.200
Even though you have worse
things happening,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.113
13:12:
Brother will betray brother to

00:34:06.113 --> 00:34:08.697
death, a father his child,
and children will rise against

00:34:08.697 --> 00:34:10.449
parents and have them put to
death;

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:12.856
and you will be hated by all
because of my name,

00:34:12.856 --> 00:34:15.469
but the one who endures to the
end will be saved.

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:18.152
In other words,
familial divisions even,

00:34:18.152 --> 00:34:21.663
that households will be torn
apart by the suffering,

00:34:21.663 --> 00:34:23.039
by the conflict.
 

00:34:23.039 --> 00:34:27.143
Then 13:14, "But when you
see the desolating sacrilege set

00:34:27.143 --> 00:34:30.518
up where it ought not to
be," now here's one of

00:34:30.518 --> 00:34:33.829
those little phrases,
"Let the reader

00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:35.260
understand."
 

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.103
The author is giving you a
very, very clear clue that this

00:34:38.103 --> 00:34:40.550
is when you really better be
paying attention,

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:42.889
"let the reader
understand."

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.070
"When you see the
desolating sacrilege set up

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.539
where it ought not to be."
 

00:34:46.539 --> 00:34:47.800
Have we heard that before?
 

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.193
The abomination of desolation
is the King James English

00:34:51.193 --> 00:34:52.449
translation of it.
 

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:55.195
The desolating sacrilege is
often what is translated in more

00:34:55.195 --> 00:34:57.396
modern Bibles;
it all refers to the same

00:34:57.396 --> 00:34:57.980
language.
 

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.663
Where have we heard about the
abomination of desolation being

00:35:00.663 --> 00:35:02.809
set up where it ought not to be
set up before?

00:35:02.809 --> 00:35:06.750
Daniel;
the words come right out of

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:07.420
Daniel.
 

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.398
They occur three--Daniel was
written in a combination of

00:35:10.398 --> 00:35:13.702
Hebrew and Aramaic and this is
in Greek, but this is the Greek

00:35:13.702 --> 00:35:14.570
translation.
 

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.710
You have it in Daniel 9:27,
Daniel 11:31,

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:21.085
and Daniel 12:11,
so this Jesus has read his

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:21.949
Daniel.
 

00:35:21.949 --> 00:35:27.579
Then you have warnings and
woes, verses 15 through 13,

00:35:27.579 --> 00:35:30.659
so you have all this stuff.
 

00:35:30.659 --> 00:35:32.650
What happens after that?
 

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.820
The one on the housetop must
not go down into house and take

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.797
anything away;
the one in the field must not

00:35:37.797 --> 00:35:38.840
turn back to get the coat.
 

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.806
Woe to those who are pregnant,
to those who are nursing

00:35:40.806 --> 00:35:41.679
infants in those days!
 

00:35:41.679 --> 00:35:43.039
Pray that it may not be in
winter.

00:35:43.039 --> 00:35:45.291
For in those days there will be
suffering such as not had been

00:35:45.291 --> 00:35:46.880
from the beginning of creation
that God .

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.610
and never will be.
 

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.344
And if the Lord had not cut
short those days,

00:35:49.344 --> 00:35:50.289
no one would be saved.
 

00:35:50.289 --> 00:35:53.989
Now notice, we're not getting
any more historical events here,

00:35:53.989 --> 00:35:56.427
we're not getting any more
stuff happening except right

00:35:56.427 --> 00:35:57.974
then he says,
"If anyone says to you,

00:35:57.974 --> 00:35:58.179
'Look!
 

00:35:58.179 --> 00:35:58.809
Here is the Messiah!'
 

00:35:58.809 --> 00:35:59.380
or 'Look!
 

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:00.300
There he is!'--do not believe
it."

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.597
False Messiahs,
false prophets,

00:36:01.597 --> 00:36:03.630
so there's more false besides
false prophets.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.702
"In those days after that
suffering,"

00:36:05.702 --> 00:36:08.001
now here's where you really get
the cataclysmic end,

00:36:08.001 --> 00:36:10.420
the world crashing down:
The sun will be darkened,

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.956
the moon will not give its
light, and stars will fall from

00:36:12.956 --> 00:36:15.579
the skies, and the powers in the
heavens will be shaken.

00:36:15.579 --> 00:36:20.199
Then you will see the Son of
Man coming in clouds with great

00:36:20.199 --> 00:36:21.610
glory and power.
 

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:24.052
Then he will send out the
angels, and gather his elect

00:36:24.052 --> 00:36:26.309
from the four winds,
from the ends of the earth to

00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:27.369
the ends of heaven.
 

00:36:27.369 --> 00:36:29.480
When does it happen?
 

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.708
Right after the abomination of
desolation is set up where it

00:36:33.708 --> 00:36:35.000
ought not to be.
 

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.659
What is the abomination of
desolation?

00:36:36.659 --> 00:36:38.039
Well, we don't know.
 

00:36:38.039 --> 00:36:41.452
Obviously if Jesus is reading
Daniel, and this is where he's

00:36:41.452 --> 00:36:43.418
getting this,
he also believes that

00:36:43.418 --> 00:36:46.079
something's going to happen in
the temple.

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:49.307
That author Daniel believed it
was something that Antiochus IV

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:52.007
Epiphanes may be sacrificed a
pig on the altar or he

00:36:52.007 --> 00:36:54.971
desecrated somehow the altar in
the Holy of Holies in the

00:36:54.971 --> 00:36:55.659
temple.
 

00:36:55.659 --> 00:36:58.826
Jesus doesn't believe that that
event was the end event as

00:36:58.826 --> 00:37:00.159
Daniel thought it was.
 

00:37:00.159 --> 00:37:02.630
Jesus is predicting that this
is going to happen,

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:04.588
something's going to happen in
the temple that is going to be

00:37:04.588 --> 00:37:06.626
so awful,
and it's going to be an

00:37:06.626 --> 00:37:09.500
abomination,
and once that happens then all

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:13.489
hell breaks loose and when all
hell is broken loose the worst,

00:37:13.489 --> 00:37:17.179
then the Son of Man will swoop
down in the clouds with angels

00:37:17.179 --> 00:37:18.840
and put a stop to it all.
 

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.480
That'll be the glorification.
 

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.530
When does this happen?
 

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:26.827
Well Mark has told us one
thing: it's going to happen

00:37:26.827 --> 00:37:28.110
during your own generation.
 

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:30.070
Jesus has said,
"This generation will not

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:31.989
pass away before this stuff
happens."

00:37:31.989 --> 00:37:34.693
The apostles asked him,
so he said, "Well it will

00:37:34.693 --> 00:37:35.969
be within a generation.
 

00:37:35.969 --> 00:37:37.581
Then he says,
nobody's going to know the

00:37:37.581 --> 00:37:38.920
exact time,
but once you see the

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.358
abomination of desolation set up
in the temple where it ought not

00:37:41.358 --> 00:37:42.617
to be,
that's when it's going to

00:37:42.617 --> 00:37:42.900
happen.
 

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.949
Now did this happen?
 

00:37:45.949 --> 00:37:51.090
Well, we're not narrated
anything about it.

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:55.775
What does Mark not narrate in
this section that we as

00:37:55.775 --> 00:37:59.650
historians know happened with
the temple?

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:02.460
What?
 

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.989
What does he not narrate
happening?

00:38:05.989 --> 00:38:07.940
Its destruction.
 

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:11.465
Jesus predicts the destruction,
Jesus prophesied about

00:38:11.465 --> 00:38:15.126
destruction, but Mark doesn't
tell us that the temple in

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:16.989
Jerusalem are destroyed.
 

00:38:16.989 --> 00:38:21.032
He doesn't tell us explicitly
about the Roman armies led by

00:38:21.032 --> 00:38:25.284
Vespasian and Titus surrounding
Jerusalem and besieging it for

00:38:25.284 --> 00:38:26.260
two years.
 

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:30.867
He doesn't tell us that in the
year 70, the Romans actually did

00:38:30.867 --> 00:38:35.030
take Jerusalem and burn the
temple destroy the temple.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:38.070
If Mark knew about that why
didn't he tell us about it?

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:41.186
This is why scholars--a lot of
scholars believe this is exactly

00:38:41.186 --> 00:38:41.889
like Daniel.
 

00:38:41.889 --> 00:38:44.070
Remember how we said,
how do you date Daniel?

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:48.409
You figure out when does has
his history gone right?

00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:51.139
When does his history not go
right anymore?

00:38:51.139 --> 00:38:55.239
If you applied that same
standard of text to this text,

00:38:55.239 --> 00:38:58.210
what you've got is a prediction
of the temple destruction,

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:01.530
so at least the writer knows
that it is likely to happen.

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:04.454
He can see it happening in the
future but he doesn't narrate it

00:39:04.454 --> 00:39:05.019
happening.
 

00:39:05.019 --> 00:39:06.050
Yes sir?
 

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:09.518
Student:  I was just
wondering about a timeline;

00:39:09.518 --> 00:39:11.632
the version I have has "a
generation"

00:39:11.632 --> 00:39:13.380
translated also as
"race."

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.400
Prof: Yes.
 

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:20.521
Conservative Christians know
that more than one generation

00:39:20.521 --> 00:39:25.130
has happened since that time;
many, many, many generations.

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:27.454
They've taken the Greek word
translated here as

00:39:27.454 --> 00:39:29.929
"generation,"
which I think is the right

00:39:29.929 --> 00:39:31.666
translation,
and they say well,

00:39:31.666 --> 00:39:34.639
you can take that to
mean "race of people."

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:37.420
Of course what race would they
then be referring too?

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.300
The Jews, and so conservative
Christians who don't believe--

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.532
who believe this has to be an
accurate prediction of something

00:39:43.532 --> 00:39:45.179
that's going to happen in our
future also,

00:39:45.179 --> 00:39:48.333
translate that as race or say,
the generation doesn't refer to

00:39:48.333 --> 00:39:50.659
a generation of time of forty
years or so,

00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:52.530
it means they're a race of the
Jews.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:55.599
As long as there are Jews in
existence then this thing can

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:57.646
still go on and it hasn't
happened yet,

00:39:57.646 --> 00:39:59.639
so that explains the
translation.

00:39:59.639 --> 00:40:03.175
Quite frankly,
I think the translation's just

00:40:03.175 --> 00:40:03.820
wrong.
 

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.570
It seems to me that what Mark's
intention is to put some kind of

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:08.820
time limit on this.
 

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.659
He's trying to get his readers
to see a time.

00:40:10.659 --> 00:40:13.911
Well if you just say the race
of the Jews, then that doesn't

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:15.510
give you any sense of time.
 

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.880
Did you have a question?
 

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.570
Okay, so where are we now?
 

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.657
I think what's going on is
this, let's just think

00:40:24.657 --> 00:40:25.920
of--imagine this happening.
 

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.090
16:1-8 I've already read.
 

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:31.550
What happens in 16:1-8?
 

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.309
The women are told that Jesus
has been raised from the dead,

00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:38.681
as Jesus predicted he would be,
and the young man tells the

00:40:38.681 --> 00:40:41.052
women,
go tell his disciples that he

00:40:41.052 --> 00:40:44.170
will go before them to Galilee,
go meet him in Galilee.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.989
In fact earlier,
in Mark, in one of these sorts

00:40:46.989 --> 00:40:50.175
of passion predictions,
Jesus had told the disciples,

00:40:50.175 --> 00:40:53.239
once I'm dead I will go before
you to Galilee.

00:40:53.239 --> 00:40:56.706
Implying that they're supposed
to follow him to Galilee,

00:40:56.706 --> 00:40:58.030
but then 16:8 ends.
 

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:00.429
One possible reconstruction for
all of this,

00:41:00.429 --> 00:41:02.557
and this is just an
interpretation put out by some

00:41:02.557 --> 00:41:03.900
scholars,
accepted by some,

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.590
rejected by a whole lot of
others.

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:10.230
What if Mark himself is writing
right before the year 70?

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.617
He knows--maybe he's even
writing in Galilee himself,

00:41:13.617 --> 00:41:15.900
or in someplace close to
Galilee.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:19.556
He knows--the Roman army went
through Galilee first in the

00:41:19.556 --> 00:41:22.510
year 66 and 68 and destroyed
lots of stuff,

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:26.331
and they won their battles
against the Jews in Galilee

00:41:26.331 --> 00:41:26.909
first.
 

00:41:26.909 --> 00:41:29.476
They won through Galilee on
their way to Jerusalem,

00:41:29.476 --> 00:41:32.402
they get to Jerusalem around
68, and for two years they're

00:41:32.402 --> 00:41:34.250
besieging the city of Jerusalem.
 

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.309
What if Mark has written right
at that time,

00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:38.460
before Jerusalem had actually
been taken,

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.530
before the temple had actually
been destroyed,

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.420
because he has Jesus predict,
like Daniel predicted,

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.670
some abomination of desolation
happening in the temple,

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.715
but we don't know of anything
like that really that happened

00:41:47.715 --> 00:41:48.929
as a historical event right
then.

00:41:48.929 --> 00:41:52.059
The temple was simply destroyed
by the Romans.

00:41:52.059 --> 00:41:54.123
We might think,
well maybe he thinks that

00:41:54.123 --> 00:41:57.530
they're going to set up a Roman
standard there or do something,

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.559
but we're not narrated what
actually happened.

00:41:59.559 --> 00:42:04.440
In this scenario Mark writes
his Gospel with this message,

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:08.333
"Things are going to get a
lot worse before they get

00:42:08.333 --> 00:42:10.742
better,
and just like they got a lot

00:42:10.742 --> 00:42:13.250
worse for Jesus before they got
better,

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.559
they're going to get a lot
worse for us before they get

00:42:16.559 --> 00:42:17.480
better."
 

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.396
You need to be prepared,
because if you think that the

00:42:20.396 --> 00:42:23.478
Romans are going to win and
we're all going to be carried

00:42:23.478 --> 00:42:26.460
off into slavery,
you don't have the right faith.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.449
Jesus told us this.
 

00:42:28.449 --> 00:42:30.905
Jesus told us it wouldn't be
all pie in the sky by and by,

00:42:30.905 --> 00:42:33.449
it wouldn't be all good stuff,
we're going to have to suffer

00:42:33.449 --> 00:42:34.570
just like He suffered.
 

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:39.233
He writes this Gospel message
that over and over again has

00:42:39.233 --> 00:42:42.670
Jesus saying,
suffering must precede glory,

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:45.369
suffering must precede glory.
 

00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:48.554
He even has Jesus predict
around the time when all this

00:42:48.554 --> 00:42:51.009
will happen,
when you see Jerusalem--if

00:42:51.009 --> 00:42:54.449
Jerusalem is surrounded by Roman
armies who are pagans,

00:42:54.449 --> 00:42:58.639
you can pretty well guess that
something's going to happen.

00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:01.873
I believe that the Gospel of
Mark may have been written right

00:43:01.873 --> 00:43:05.045
before 70 or right around 70,
but the destruction of the

00:43:05.045 --> 00:43:07.882
temple has not sunk into
consciousness yet or is not

00:43:07.882 --> 00:43:08.940
known to happen.
 

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.744
Maybe even Mark himself and his
disciples are themselves in

00:43:12.744 --> 00:43:13.400
Galilee.
 

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.489
Maybe this is why he says,
we're supposed to be Galilee

00:43:16.489 --> 00:43:19.409
waiting for Jesus,
and then He will appear to us.

00:43:19.409 --> 00:43:21.447
When all is worse,
when it just seems like

00:43:21.447 --> 00:43:25.137
everything couldn't get worse,
I tell you he's going to come

00:43:25.137 --> 00:43:28.530
in on the clouds and he'll
destroy the Romans,

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:30.550
and he'll set up the Kingdom of
God.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.739
If he's doing this it makes a
lot of sense for the document

00:43:33.739 --> 00:43:35.280
also ending where it ends.
 

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.650
It says, "Tell them to go
to Galilee and wait,"

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.849
and Jesus goes to Galilee to
meet them.

00:43:42.849 --> 00:43:47.632
In a sense, Mark's telling his
readers, all we have to do is

00:43:47.632 --> 00:43:50.389
stay here and he'll come for us.
 

00:43:50.389 --> 00:43:54.990
That's one historical reading
of the Gospel of Mark that

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:58.170
places it in one,
not provable time;

00:43:58.170 --> 00:43:59.960
some scholars believe Mark was
written in Rome.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.949
Some people believe it was
written after 70.

00:44:02.949 --> 00:44:05.670
I would say if Mark was written
70,

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.088
very long after 70,
I would clearly expect him to

00:44:08.088 --> 00:44:11.012
narrate the destruction of
Jerusalem and the destruction of

00:44:11.012 --> 00:44:13.230
the temple,
as Luke does.

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.876
When you read Luke,
who used Mark as one of his

00:44:15.876 --> 00:44:18.250
sources,
you'll notice that the writer

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:22.030
of the Gospel of Luke uses this
passage out of Mark and he edits

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.219
it,
to add in the destruction of

00:44:25.219 --> 00:44:28.780
the temple before Jesus comes
back.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:29.920
The reason?
 

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.143
Because the writer of Luke knew
that the temple had been

00:44:32.143 --> 00:44:32.630
destroyed.
 

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.260
Why doesn't Mark tell about it?
 

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.019
Because he doesn't know yet
that it's been destroyed.

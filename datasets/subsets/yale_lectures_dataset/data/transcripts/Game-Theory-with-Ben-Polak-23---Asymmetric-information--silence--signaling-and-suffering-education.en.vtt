00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.796
Professor Ben Polak:
So today we're going to

00:00:03.796 --> 00:00:06.467
study asymmetric information.
It's our last week,

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:09.610
and we're going to focus on
signaling today.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.173
I'll spell it with one "L" here
as a concession to the

00:00:13.173 --> 00:00:15.884
Americans.
So we're going to divide this

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:20.994
class into two parts.
And for the first part we're

00:00:20.994 --> 00:00:28.323
going to focus on the case where
there is some verifiable

00:00:28.323 --> 00:00:33.825
information in the problem.
So we'll see what this means in

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.925
a while, but let me just set up
an example and we'll see where

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:39.806
that takes us.
So I want to return to a game

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:43.630
we know well by this stage,
which is the Cournot game.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.999
So there's two firms,
and they're competing in

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:51.642
Cournot--so they're competing in
quantities--and we'll call the

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:55.310
firms A and B.
Suppose that Firm B has

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.859
costs--so to be more formal,
these are constant marginal

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.803
costs--equal to cM,
where M means middle or medium

00:01:05.803 --> 00:01:12.497
or something.
Firm A also has costs but those

00:01:12.497 --> 00:01:18.790
costs could come in one of three
types.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.940
It could be that Firm A has
high costs, and high costs are

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.580
equal to middle costs,
plus a little bit.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.720
It could be that Firm A also
has medium costs.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.755
And it could be that Firm A has
low costs, and the low costs are

00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:48.239
just the medium costs minus a
little bit.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:51.202
Now, before this competition's
going to take place,

00:01:51.202 --> 00:01:54.402
before they're actually going
to play the Cournot game,

00:01:54.402 --> 00:02:00.951
Firm A has an opportunity.
Firm A's opportunity is to

00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:07.922
reveal its costs to Firm B.
So to make this more explicit,

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:11.159
initially, Firm B obviously
knows his own costs and,

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.892
since there is only one type,
Firm A obviously knows those

00:02:13.892 --> 00:02:17.048
costs as well.
So Firm A and Firm B know what

00:02:17.048 --> 00:02:19.739
Firm B's costs are.
But initially,

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.529
although Firm A knows her own
costs, Firm B does not know Firm

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.510
A's costs.
So let's write that up.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:48.430
So Firm B knows only its costs,
and Firm A knows both costs.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.820
But the key decision we're
going to focus on is that Firm A

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.060
has an opportunity to reveal its
true costs to Firm B.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.340
Now, it can do so in a
verifiable way.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.800
For example,
it could hire an accountant.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.590
That accountant from a
reputable outside firm could

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.051
come in and do the accounts for
Firm A and then publish them in

00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:10.340
The Wall Street Journal or
something.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.214
So Firm A can do that,
and let's assume it's costless

00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:25.556
for it to do that.
So Firm A can costlessly and

00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:39.199
verifiably reveal its costs to
B.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.813
The question is:
this is going to happen before

00:03:41.813 --> 00:03:44.620
they play Cournot.
The question is:

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.900
should Firm A reveal those
costs or not?

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.605
Should Firm A publicize or give
away its informational

00:03:52.605 --> 00:03:56.102
advantage, if you like,
to Firm B by telling Firm B

00:03:56.102 --> 00:04:00.219
what its costs look like.
So what do people think?

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.159
Let me grab the mike and ask
people a little bit.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.569
Imagine you're the manager of
Firm A.

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.310
Are you going to tell Firm B
what you're costs are or not?

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.127
Wave a hand in the air,
or should I just cold call

00:04:14.127 --> 00:04:15.533
here?
Let me cold call,

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:17.879
so what's your name sir?
Student: Hugh.

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.688
Professor Ben Polak:
Hugh, and so suppose you're

00:04:20.688 --> 00:04:22.873
the manager of Firm A,
would you reveal the

00:04:22.873 --> 00:04:25.470
information or not?
Student: I would tell

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.170
them only if my costs were
lower.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.986
Professor Ben Polak:
All right,

00:04:28.986 --> 00:04:31.883
so Hugh says I would reveal the
information only if my costs

00:04:31.883 --> 00:04:34.255
were lower.
Now why do you want to reveal

00:04:34.255 --> 00:04:36.230
the costs if you have lower
costs?

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.085
Student: Because then my
firm will produce at a lower

00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:44.267
cost so Firm B will produce less
because they know that we'll get

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:46.257
most of the market.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:04:46.257 --> 00:04:48.440
Good.
It's Hugh, is that right?

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.736
Student: Yeah.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:52.625
So the point that Hugh is
making is there may be some

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:55.669
advantage in having the other
side know my costs if my costs

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.673
are low,
since that may induce the other

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:01.498
side to produce less.
Let's just fill out that

00:05:01.498 --> 00:05:03.640
argument by putting in the
Cournot diagram.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.450
So here's the Cournot diagram.
Here's the quantity for Firm A.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:14.779
Here's the quantity for Firm B.
And here is the best response

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:19.810
or reaction curve for Firm B.
And in this picture there's

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.313
going to be three different
possible reaction curves for

00:05:23.313 --> 00:05:26.689
Firm A, each one corresponding
to different costs.

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:29.808
So, for example,
this could be the reaction

00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:34.413
curve or the best response for
Firm A in the case in which it's

00:05:34.413 --> 00:05:37.132
medium.
But if it had lower costs what

00:05:37.132 --> 00:05:39.480
would happen to that reaction
curve?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.759
Would it shift in,
would it tilt,

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.410
what would happen to it?
Someone shout it out.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.382
It would shift out.
If it had lower costs then it

00:05:46.382 --> 00:05:51.882
would shift out so this would be
the best response for Firm A in

00:05:51.882 --> 00:05:54.746
the low case,
and conversely,

00:05:54.746 --> 00:06:00.709
this would be the best response
for Firm A in the high case.

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:04.233
So the point that Hugh is
making--or he should correct me

00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:08.259
if this is unfairly paraphrasing
him--is if I have low costs then

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.223
I want the other side to know I
have low costs because that puts

00:06:12.223 --> 00:06:16.123
us into the equilibrium in which
this is my best response curve

00:06:16.123 --> 00:06:19.709
and this is the other side's
best response curve,

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:24.774
and Firm B ends up producing
less and ends up lowering its

00:06:24.774 --> 00:06:27.470
production.
Is that right?

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.636
So the key idea here is that
this is a game--an idea we've

00:06:31.636 --> 00:06:35.510
had often--this is a game of
strategic substitutes.

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.876
So if I have low costs,
I want the other side to know

00:06:42.876 --> 00:06:46.737
that I have low costs because it
will cut back its production

00:06:46.737 --> 00:06:49.538
which helps me.
On the other hand,

00:06:49.538 --> 00:06:53.923
if I have high costs,
then I kind of like to remain

00:06:53.923 --> 00:06:56.083
hidden.
I really don't want the other

00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:58.651
side to know that I have high
costs, because if I have high

00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:00.756
costs,
the other firm's actually going

00:07:00.756 --> 00:07:03.949
to increase their production and
that's going to hurt me.

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:08.560
But notice I've twisted the
question a little bit.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.118
The question I actually asked
you was: would you reveal the

00:07:12.118 --> 00:07:15.839
information about your costs.
And I flipped that around to a

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:19.539
slightly easier question which
is: what would I like the other

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:22.301
side to know?
Now what would I like the other

00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:24.439
side to know?
I'd like the other side to know

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:26.614
if I have low costs.
I'd like the other side not to

00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:28.738
know if I have high costs,
but that's not quite the

00:07:28.738 --> 00:07:31.408
question we asked.
The question we asked was would

00:07:31.408 --> 00:07:34.907
you, given whatever your costs
are, reveal that information to

00:07:34.907 --> 00:07:37.976
the other side?
I think what Hugh has told us

00:07:37.976 --> 00:07:41.978
is--so to say exactly what he
said--Hugh said if I had low

00:07:41.978 --> 00:07:45.490
costs I'm going to reveal it to
the other side.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.170
Is that right?
So, so far what do we know?

00:07:49.170 --> 00:08:05.190
So far we know that if I have
low costs then I will reveal it.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:10.767
So far we know that.
But what if I don't have low

00:08:10.767 --> 00:08:14.125
costs?
What if I have middling costs

00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:17.761
or high costs?
Well let's take these in turn,

00:08:17.761 --> 00:08:23.963
what about middling costs?
What should I do if I have

00:08:23.963 --> 00:08:29.062
middle level costs?
So somebody's got their hand

00:08:29.062 --> 00:08:31.870
up, let me go and take advantage
of that.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.379
What's your name?
Student: Alec.

00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:35.811
Professor Ben Polak:
Shout it out so people can

00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:37.936
hear.
Student: I think you

00:08:37.936 --> 00:08:42.312
should still reveal because they
know if you had low costs you

00:08:42.312 --> 00:08:45.541
would reveal,
and so if you had middle costs

00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:49.497
and you didn't reveal then they
could think you either had

00:08:49.497 --> 00:08:53.452
middle costs or high costs and
it's better for you to just

00:08:53.452 --> 00:08:56.090
reveal that you had middle
costs.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.440
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, did people hear that?

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.611
Let me just repeat that.
So you might think that if I

00:09:00.611 --> 00:09:03.818
have middle costs,
you might think that I could

00:09:03.818 --> 00:09:07.165
reveal or not reveal,
depending on what the other

00:09:07.165 --> 00:09:10.936
side thought.
However, what Alec's arguing

00:09:10.936 --> 00:09:15.968
correctly, is if I don't reveal
that I have middle costs,

00:09:15.968 --> 00:09:20.101
the other side,
Firm B, knows that my costs are

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.698
not low.
So the only way they could

00:09:22.698 --> 00:09:25.610
mistake me is they could think
I'm a high cost firm.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.740
They know I'm not a low cost
firm.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.389
How do they know I'm not a low
cost firm?

00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:32.077
Because the low cost firm would
have revealed,

00:09:32.077 --> 00:09:35.308
that was Hugh's argument.
So since low costs are firms

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:37.736
are revealing,
if I'm the middle cost firm,

00:09:37.736 --> 00:09:41.031
if I don't reveal no one's in
any doubt I'm not a low cost

00:09:41.031 --> 00:09:43.963
firm.
So all I could be is a middle

00:09:43.963 --> 00:09:48.610
cost firm or a high cost firm.
All I could have is this

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.339
reaction curve,
which is the one I actually

00:09:52.339 --> 00:09:57.417
have, or this reaction curve.
So if I don't reveal then the

00:09:57.417 --> 00:10:01.891
other side might think that I
have high costs in which case

00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:06.057
they're actually going to
increase their production and

00:10:06.057 --> 00:10:09.071
hurt me.
So since the low cost firm is

00:10:09.071 --> 00:10:12.330
going to reveal,
the medium cost wants to reveal

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.659
to ensure that no one thinks
it's high costs.

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:28.830
So low cost reveals and
therefore cM reveals as well to

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:40.049
prevent being mistaken for a
high cost firm.

00:10:40.049 --> 00:10:41.850
Now there was a question,
let me come down and collect

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.360
the question.
Yeah?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.443
Student: I was just
going to ask what if you have,

00:10:47.443 --> 00:10:49.230
A reveals to both to the low
and middle class,

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.762
then they're obviously going to
know that he's a high cost,

00:10:51.762 --> 00:10:54.120
which means that the concealing
doesn't do any good.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.364
Professor Ben Polak:
Exactly,

00:10:55.364 --> 00:10:56.870
and your name is?
Student: Bethany.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.229
Professor Ben Polak:
So Bethany's pointing out

00:10:59.229 --> 00:11:01.769
that once we know the low cost
type's going to reveal,

00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:05.695
we know that the middle cost
type is also going to reveal so

00:11:05.695 --> 00:11:08.690
as not to get mistaken for being
high cost,

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.293
which means,
if you're running a high cost

00:11:11.293 --> 00:11:15.039
firm, it really doesn't matter
whether you reveal or not,

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:17.495
because you're going to be
revealed by the fact that you

00:11:17.495 --> 00:11:19.610
didn't reveal.
Is that right?

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.080
Had you been low cost you would
have revealed.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.100
Had you been middle cost you
would have revealed.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.834
And therefore,
whether you choose to reveal or

00:11:25.834 --> 00:11:27.530
not, everyone knows that you're
high cost.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:41.450
So therefore, cH is revealed.
Everyone see that?

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:47.492
Okay, now notice that in this
argument we've just constructed

00:11:47.492 --> 00:11:52.124
there were three types of firms
- high, middle,

00:11:52.124 --> 00:11:54.718
low.
But I could have constructed

00:11:54.718 --> 00:11:58.358
exactly the same argument,
albeit somewhat more tediously,

00:11:58.358 --> 00:12:02.136
with a 100 types of firms.
Firms that had absolutely the

00:12:02.136 --> 00:12:05.060
lowest costs,
firms that had the 99th highest

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.980
costs, 98th highest costs,
97th highest costs and so on.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.000
And this argument would have
been exactly the same.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.219
At each stage the firm that's
left in the analysis who has the

00:12:15.219 --> 00:12:19.645
lowest cost, will want to reveal
to distinguish itself from those

00:12:19.645 --> 00:12:23.156
who haven't revealed "yet,"
and therefore we'll get

00:12:23.156 --> 00:12:25.419
unraveling.
We'll get information to be

00:12:25.419 --> 00:12:27.371
revealed, and notice
interestingly,

00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:30.700
we'll get information to be
revealed beyond the medium.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.595
So the 51st highest cost firm
will reveal, therefore the 50th

00:12:34.595 --> 00:12:38.620
highest cost firm will reveal,
therefore the 49th and so on.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.171
In fact, the only firm who
won't explicitly,

00:12:41.171 --> 00:12:44.731
actively reveal themselves is
the firm who has absolutely the

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:46.916
highest cost.
And as Bethany points out,

00:12:46.916 --> 00:12:48.590
they're going to be revealed
anyway.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:58.153
So this is an idea--this idea
is called "informational

00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:02.427
unraveling."
And again, in keeping for my

00:13:02.427 --> 00:13:05.236
American audience,
I'm going to put one "l" in

00:13:05.236 --> 00:13:06.973
unraveling.
Is that right,

00:13:06.973 --> 00:13:09.070
there's one "l" in America
right?

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.644
Someone should just check that
on Google or something,

00:13:12.644 --> 00:13:16.179
I think that's correct.
What's the lesson here?

00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:17.830
So one lesson is that this
happens.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.355
We'll come back to that,
but another lesson,

00:13:20.355 --> 00:13:23.410
perhaps a more important lesson
is: often the lack of

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.082
information,
the lack of somebody signaling

00:13:26.082 --> 00:13:29.490
to you, the lack of somebody
trying to tell you something,

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.994
conveys information.
This was the point that Bethany

00:13:32.994 --> 00:13:35.365
was making.
The fact that the high cost

00:13:35.365 --> 00:13:38.840
firm doesn't in fact go out and
reveal information to you,

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.340
reveals something about what it
knows.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.700
So Hugh's initial comment was
correct.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.317
If I was the high cost firm I'd
like to remain hidden but I

00:13:47.317 --> 00:13:50.434
can't remain hidden.
From your point of the view as

00:13:50.434 --> 00:13:53.863
the receiver of the information,
there is information in the

00:13:53.863 --> 00:13:56.480
lack of the attempt to convey
information.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:02.736
So lesson: the lack of a
signal, the lack of an attempt

00:14:02.736 --> 00:14:08.993
of a firm to signal you some
information, the lack of a

00:14:08.993 --> 00:14:12.470
signal can be informative.

00:14:17.539 --> 00:14:19.529
So this is an often forgotten
lesson.

00:14:19.529 --> 00:14:22.712
It's a very simple idea,
but there's a natural tendency

00:14:22.712 --> 00:14:25.718
when you're dealing with
information to focus on the

00:14:25.718 --> 00:14:30.528
evidence that is there,
rather than the evidence that's

00:14:30.528 --> 00:14:33.301
not there.
There's an expression that goes

00:14:33.301 --> 00:14:36.419
with this.
The expression is "silence

00:14:36.419 --> 00:14:39.019
speaks volumes."
You've all heard that

00:14:39.019 --> 00:14:40.629
expression, silence speaks
volumes.

00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:43.320
Let me give you one other
example.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.292
So there's a Sherlock Holmes
story--by the way,

00:14:45.292 --> 00:14:47.049
do you all know who Sherlock
Holmes is?

00:14:47.049 --> 00:14:50.537
Good, so there's a Sherlock
Holmes story in which Sherlock

00:14:50.537 --> 00:14:53.551
Holmes solves the murder.
He figures out who did the

00:14:53.551 --> 00:14:54.375
murder.
And Dr.

00:14:54.375 --> 00:14:57.794
Watson who's his sidekick is
trying to figure out how Holmes

00:14:57.794 --> 00:15:00.169
could possibly have solved the
murder.

00:15:00.169 --> 00:15:02.029
He says how did you solve the
murder?

00:15:02.029 --> 00:15:05.843
Holmes says,
it's because of the barking

00:15:05.843 --> 00:15:07.346
dog.
And Watson says,

00:15:07.346 --> 00:15:10.210
what do you mean it's because
of the barking dog?

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.941
The dog didn't bark.
Holmes says,

00:15:12.941 --> 00:15:15.553
that's exactly the point,
the fact that the dog didn't

00:15:15.553 --> 00:15:18.461
bark, didn't make any sound
tells us who must have committed

00:15:18.461 --> 00:15:20.804
the murder.
It's very easy to fall into the

00:15:20.804 --> 00:15:23.562
trap of being Watson and to
ignore the thing that didn't

00:15:23.562 --> 00:15:26.070
happen and focus on the things
that did happen.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.290
Here, it's easy to forget that
actually the high cost firm is

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:35.078
revealed by doing nothing.
So this is the idea that

00:15:35.078 --> 00:15:38.250
silence can speak volumes.

00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:45.777
Every year I go back and try
and figure out what that

00:15:45.777 --> 00:15:47.789
quotation is from and I can
never find it,

00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:50.580
so anybody who finds it I will
give them a prize of some sort.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:54.633
Originally I thought it must be
Shakespeare but it doesn't

00:15:54.633 --> 00:15:57.408
appear to be.
So this is a little example

00:15:57.408 --> 00:16:00.445
involving Cournot,
but I want to try and convince

00:16:00.445 --> 00:16:03.040
you that this example is more
general.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.509
Let's pick up the question;
sorry go ahead.

00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:09.941
Student: Isn't it
possible that there's an

00:16:09.941 --> 00:16:15.296
equilibrium where the costs of
remaining hidden as a middle

00:16:15.296 --> 00:16:19.423
cost firm outweighs the benefit.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:16:19.423 --> 00:16:20.820
Not if we take the model
literally.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.859
Not if we take the model in
Cournot literally because,

00:16:23.859 --> 00:16:27.299
suppose Firm B doesn't know
whether you're high or middle,

00:16:27.299 --> 00:16:30.379
then he's going to think your
costs are somewhere in between

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:33.510
and relative to your costs being
middle he's going to produce

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.639
more,
that's the point here.

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:36.929
Now it's true that in a richer
model there may be some other

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.519
advantage in having information
hidden,

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:41.000
but that would have already
applied to the low cost firm.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.238
Let me give you some other
examples and we'll see this in

00:16:44.238 --> 00:16:46.840
other contexts,
and see that it might actually

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.297
ring true.
So one other example involves

00:16:51.297 --> 00:16:54.011
resumes.
So this example requires some

00:16:54.011 --> 00:16:55.919
explanation for the
non-Americans.

00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:58.519
How many of you are
non-Americans here?

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:01.666
So one thing you need to know
as non-Americans is the way in

00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:03.800
which people write resumes in
America.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.309
Everyone know what a resume is?
A CV, a resume, right?

00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:08.523
So when you look at a typical
resume from an American

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:11.926
student--if you're not American,
for those of you who aren't

00:17:11.926 --> 00:17:14.970
American--how should I put this
politely?

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.960
It has a tendency to make you
want to vomit.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.536
So that's basically the polite
version of what I was going to

00:17:21.536 --> 00:17:24.365
say about that.
So why does it have a tendency

00:17:24.365 --> 00:17:27.459
to make you want to vomit?
Because Americans have a

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:30.440
tendency to put down everything
on their resume.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.678
So if they were captain of the
chess team in third grade,

00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:37.921
and there they are now,
they're forty and applying for

00:17:37.921 --> 00:17:40.354
a job, it still says I was
captain of the chess team in

00:17:40.354 --> 00:17:42.374
third grade.
And this is particularly true

00:17:42.374 --> 00:17:45.249
when it comes to public service,
when it comes to sort of moral

00:17:45.249 --> 00:17:47.037
acts.
So most people in Europe will

00:17:47.037 --> 00:17:49.628
be a bit embarrassed about
writing their good deeds on

00:17:49.628 --> 00:17:51.092
their resumes,
but Americans,

00:17:51.092 --> 00:17:53.894
there's a little spot on their
resume which is about their good

00:17:53.894 --> 00:17:56.470
deeds or their public service
and they put everything.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.723
When I was eight I helped a
little old lady across the road

00:17:59.723 --> 00:18:02.472
with her shopping basket,
and there it is on their

00:18:02.472 --> 00:18:05.234
resume.
So why is it that Americans

00:18:05.234 --> 00:18:08.730
reveal so much information on
their resume?

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.190
Well think about informational
unraveling, right?

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.230
So resumes are verifiable
information, it's hugely costly

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.509
to be caught cheating about your
resume.

00:18:16.509 --> 00:18:18.339
So basically you're not going
to lie on your resume.

00:18:18.339 --> 00:18:22.126
And imagine if I'm admitting
students, let's say to law

00:18:22.126 --> 00:18:25.742
school, to Yale Law School,
and I'm reading the student's

00:18:25.742 --> 00:18:29.179
resume and in the spot where I'm
expecting to see public service

00:18:29.179 --> 00:18:32.637
there's nothing written there.
What do I assume about that

00:18:32.637 --> 00:18:33.190
student?

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.150
I assume that the person did
nothing.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.111
This person has been a self
serving "evil git" their entire

00:18:44.111 --> 00:18:47.380
life, has never even helped a
little old lady across the road.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.788
So people put down everything,
even these minimal things,

00:18:50.788 --> 00:18:54.318
even these pretty shockingly
tiny acts of charity to reveal

00:18:54.318 --> 00:18:57.970
themselves from those people who
did absolutely nothing,

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.039
that are basically the devil
incarnate.

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:03.406
So this is about resumes,
let's just take this a bit

00:19:03.406 --> 00:19:05.542
further.
How many of you are from Los

00:19:05.542 --> 00:19:07.591
Angeles?
So in Los Angeles I'm led to

00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:10.613
believe, I'm told--you can
confirm this or not--there are

00:19:10.613 --> 00:19:13.069
lots and lots of restaurants.
This is true, right?

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.190
Lots of restaurants and some of
these restaurants are good and

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.686
some of them are bad.
And, more to the point for

00:19:17.686 --> 00:19:20.623
today's example,
some of these restaurants are

00:19:20.623 --> 00:19:23.430
clean and some of them are not
so clean.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:28.755
Is this true?
So it turns out that until the

00:19:28.755 --> 00:19:32.613
late nineties,
the Los Angeles Municipality

00:19:32.613 --> 00:19:34.873
rules,
local law, said that every

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:37.630
restaurant in Los Angeles
County, I think it was,

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.690
had to get visited by the
health inspector.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:43.466
And the health inspector would
come around, I think it was

00:19:43.466 --> 00:19:46.243
annually, and go to these
restaurants and they would issue

00:19:46.243 --> 00:19:48.803
a certificate,
and this was a health

00:19:48.803 --> 00:19:53.693
certificate and written on it
large letters--I think they were

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.980
red letters--was either A,
or B, or C.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.343
There may even have been A- as
well, but for the purpose of the

00:20:00.343 --> 00:20:02.460
story let's just call it A,
B, and C.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.575
Now that was all the law said.
The law did not say that you

00:20:06.575 --> 00:20:10.329
had to display your health
certificate anywhere.

00:20:10.329 --> 00:20:15.225
So what does this model tell us
to expect about Los Angeles in

00:20:15.225 --> 00:20:19.044
the mid-nineties?
Well if you're running a little

00:20:19.044 --> 00:20:23.483
restaurant in Los Angeles and
you get an A health certificate

00:20:23.483 --> 00:20:27.089
from the health inspector,
what are going to do with that

00:20:27.089 --> 00:20:28.959
A certificate?
You're going to display it

00:20:28.959 --> 00:20:30.450
prominently in the window,
right?

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.988
A health certificate.
So if you're running a slightly

00:20:33.988 --> 00:20:37.392
less healthy restaurant,
maybe this is Ale's pizza chain

00:20:37.392 --> 00:20:39.348
again,
and you still get a B

00:20:39.348 --> 00:20:42.610
certificate from the Los Angeles
Health Inspector,

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.140
are you going to display it or
not?

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.990
You're going to display it
right, because why not?

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.980
We know the A's are going to
display.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.281
These certificates are being
given to everybody,

00:20:52.281 --> 00:20:54.730
so you're going to display even
a B certificate.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.687
Now, I'm told,
from people who lived in Los

00:20:56.687 --> 00:20:59.064
Angeles at the time,
that you could go around to the

00:20:59.064 --> 00:21:01.814
greasiest spoon in Los Angeles
and look through these grease

00:21:01.814 --> 00:21:04.331
smeared windows with the
cockroaches running all up and

00:21:04.331 --> 00:21:06.561
down them,
and if you looked carefully

00:21:06.561 --> 00:21:09.652
behind the cockroaches and the
grease you'd see a certificate

00:21:09.652 --> 00:21:12.571
displayed that said C on it.
Presumably there was a D grade

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:14.289
as well: even the C's were
displaying.

00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:17.789
So that's pretty dramatic
information unraveling.

00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:22.140
Now, I'm exaggerating slightly
to make a separate point.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.824
It turns out that in certain
areas of Los Angeles you'd

00:21:24.824 --> 00:21:27.410
expect to see these health
certificates displayed,

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.398
even the C's,
and in other areas you wouldn't

00:21:30.398 --> 00:21:32.980
expect to the see the C's
displayed.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.057
Which areas would you expect
not to see people bothering

00:21:36.057 --> 00:21:38.240
displaying their C or B-
certificate?

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:44.670
Any guesses?
The tourist areas.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.703
Because for this story about
information unraveling to work,

00:21:47.703 --> 00:21:50.273
the people who are the
receivers of the information

00:21:50.273 --> 00:21:52.690
need to know that you got the
certificates.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.379
So if you're a tourist in Los
Angeles, you don't know this

00:21:55.379 --> 00:21:58.083
system is in place,
and therefore if you're a C

00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:01.319
certificate right next to
Disneyland or something,

00:22:01.319 --> 00:22:03.621
whatever it is,
you can still make some

00:22:03.621 --> 00:22:06.045
tourists ill,
without having to tell them

00:22:06.045 --> 00:22:09.284
you're about to do so.
So that's a second example,

00:22:09.284 --> 00:22:12.859
let me give a third example,
a little bit closer to home.

00:22:12.859 --> 00:22:17.004
At the last curriculum reform
at Yale, there was a big debate

00:22:17.004 --> 00:22:19.630
about what to do with Credit
D/Fail.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.336
And one of the proposals for
Credit D/Fail was to allow

00:22:23.336 --> 00:22:26.150
students to take courses Credit
D/Fail,

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:30.272
but if they ended up getting an
A or a B, they could display the

00:22:30.272 --> 00:22:33.746
A or the B on their resume.
So they take a Credit D/Fail,

00:22:33.746 --> 00:22:37.007
but if they got a grade like an
A or B, or an A- or whatever,

00:22:37.007 --> 00:22:40.160
then they could opt in and have
it put on their resume.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.150
What's wrong with that?
This is a serious proposal.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.769
I was on this committee.
This was seriously made.

00:22:44.769 --> 00:22:47.010
I didn't make the proposal but
this was made.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:54.859
What's wrong with this proposal?
What's wrong with the proposal?

00:22:54.859 --> 00:22:59.109
What would displaying Credit on
your transcript come to mean?

00:22:59.109 --> 00:23:01.783
It could come to mean C right,
it would come to mean C,

00:23:01.783 --> 00:23:04.357
because all of the A's and the
B's would unravel that

00:23:04.357 --> 00:23:08.752
information.
So if information is verifiable

00:23:08.752 --> 00:23:15.609
and can be freely transmitted,
it has a way of coming out.

00:23:15.609 --> 00:23:18.680
Let me give you one slightly
more serious example.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.588
As you all know,
if you're arrested in the

00:23:20.588 --> 00:23:23.660
U.S.--you should know this--you
have the right to remain silent.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.577
I'm not saying you're all about
to get arrested,

00:23:25.577 --> 00:23:27.861
but were you to be arrested,
you have the right to remain

00:23:27.861 --> 00:23:29.905
silent.
That right was true in Britain

00:23:29.905 --> 00:23:32.192
as well until recently,
when the government,

00:23:32.192 --> 00:23:35.065
which isn't so big on civil
liberties, changed the rule

00:23:35.065 --> 00:23:38.033
slightly.
So now you have the right to

00:23:38.033 --> 00:23:42.401
remain silent in Britain,
but the Court has the right to

00:23:42.401 --> 00:23:46.690
take into account as evidence if
you remain silent.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.579
So what's that done to the
right to remain silent.

00:23:48.579 --> 00:23:50.164
I'll leave it to you to figure
out what that's done to the

00:23:50.164 --> 00:23:53.395
right to remain silent.
So this idea that information

00:23:53.395 --> 00:23:58.642
unravels depended on certain key
parts and the most important

00:23:58.642 --> 00:24:02.840
part was that the information
was verifiable.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.029
It mattered that the
information was verifiable.

00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:12.449
And to get full unraveling all
the way down,

00:24:12.449 --> 00:24:14.700
in this case to the highest
cost firm,

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.346
you needed the people on the
receiving side of the

00:24:17.346 --> 00:24:20.750
information to actually know
that that information was there.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.924
So to get the full unraveling
you really need something like

00:24:23.924 --> 00:24:26.829
common knowledge of the presence
of the information.

00:24:26.829 --> 00:24:31.773
But often, the information that
you have--you have information,

00:24:31.773 --> 00:24:35.999
you want to reveal that
information--but unfortunately

00:24:35.999 --> 00:24:40.630
it's not so easily verifiable.
So what we're going to focus on

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.542
for the rest of today is
information that is not

00:24:43.542 --> 00:24:44.410
verifiable.

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:59.160
Let's start with an example
that's pretty close to home.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.539
A lot of you have been doing
job interviews recently.

00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:04.389
How many of you have been going
out either doing interviews for

00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:06.825
internships or jobs?
I know a lot of you are missing

00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:09.630
class so I'm assuming charitably
that's what you were doing.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.926
So when you go to these job
interviews you could imagine

00:25:12.926 --> 00:25:15.623
that you're turning up for some
job interview,

00:25:15.623 --> 00:25:18.259
let's say it's at Boring Bank
of Boston.

00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:21.476
And you turn up at this
interview for Boring Bank of

00:25:21.476 --> 00:25:25.322
Boston, and one of the things
that Boring Bank of Boston wants

00:25:25.322 --> 00:25:28.980
to know is are you interested in
working for Boring Bank of

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.259
Boston.
That's a plus for them.

00:25:32.259 --> 00:25:36.619
What they tend to do is they
ask you.

00:25:36.619 --> 00:25:41.816
More or less they say,
are you interested in working

00:25:41.816 --> 00:25:44.451
for Boring Bank?
Now by the way,

00:25:44.451 --> 00:25:47.498
if you are asked the question,
and you're interviewing for

00:25:47.498 --> 00:25:49.660
Boring Bank,
and you're asked the question

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.240
by them are you interested in
working for Boring Bank,

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.829
what answer should you give?
You should answer yes.

00:25:55.829 --> 00:25:59.119
How much information is there
in the fact that you answer yes?

00:25:59.119 --> 00:26:01.577
None at all,
right, because clearly you want

00:26:01.577 --> 00:26:05.062
the option of working for this
bank, so you're going to answer

00:26:05.062 --> 00:26:07.124
yes anyway.
Now you may think this is just

00:26:07.124 --> 00:26:08.369
a fictional example,
it's not.

00:26:08.369 --> 00:26:12.484
I talked to some recruiters
from a bank in Boston that we'll

00:26:12.484 --> 00:26:16.109
refer to as Boring Bank of
Boston not so long ago,

00:26:16.109 --> 00:26:19.562
and I asked them about hiring
Yale undergraduates and what

00:26:19.562 --> 00:26:22.470
Yale undergraduates should do to
impress them.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.422
And the recruiter,
who is a Yale graduate himself,

00:26:25.422 --> 00:26:28.917
said to me that frankly Yale
undergraduates do less well in

00:26:28.917 --> 00:26:31.869
these interviews than Harvard
undergraduates.

00:26:31.869 --> 00:26:34.859
I said, shattered and
disappointed--I said why,

00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:37.329
and he said,
well when we asked them if

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:41.099
they're interested in working
for Boring Bank of Boston the

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:46.602
Yale guys say things like,
well I don't know it sounds

00:26:46.602 --> 00:26:49.559
kind of boring.
The Harvard guys,

00:26:49.559 --> 00:26:52.032
what do they do?
They show up with The Wall

00:26:52.032 --> 00:26:55.356
Street Journal folded over
conveniently on the page about

00:26:55.356 --> 00:26:59.213
Boring Bank of Boston,
and sometimes they're wearing a

00:26:59.213 --> 00:27:03.331
silly hat with I'm boring on it.
So I tried to persuade this guy

00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:06.000
that despite this fact,
there's really no information

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.670
in the fact that the Harvard
guys are doing this,

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.931
and in fact you should hire the
Yale people because at least

00:27:10.931 --> 00:27:12.934
they were honest,
and, hey, that might make the

00:27:12.934 --> 00:27:15.559
bank less boring in the future.
This didn't work,

00:27:15.559 --> 00:27:19.648
so I need to persuade you guys
to actually cough up and be

00:27:19.648 --> 00:27:22.990
dishonest here.
There's a lesson here.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.679
So one lesson is,
if you're asked by an

00:27:25.679 --> 00:27:29.500
interviewer for a summer
internship or for a job later,

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.180
if you want to work for them,
the answer is yes.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.891
It's one of the few questions
for which the answer is not

00:27:37.891 --> 00:27:40.920
backward induction:
it's just yes.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.560
There's a secondary lesson
here, which is,

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.489
if an interviewer for a bank is
asking you in the interview if

00:27:47.489 --> 00:27:51.131
you'd like to work for them,
you probably will answer yes,

00:27:51.131 --> 00:27:53.640
but you probably want to work
somewhere else.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.149
If they're dumb enough to ask
you that question you probably

00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:59.850
want to work for someone else.
But this is a real problem.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.123
The problem is here you are.
You have some information you'd

00:28:03.123 --> 00:28:05.160
like to convey.
Maybe you really are boring.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.720
Maybe you really do want to
work for this bank.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.078
You want to convey this
information, but it's hard for

00:28:10.078 --> 00:28:13.627
you to persuade the employer
that this it is true because

00:28:13.627 --> 00:28:16.859
anybody can say they want to
work for the bank.

00:28:16.859 --> 00:28:19.523
More generally in life,
this isn't only about whether

00:28:19.523 --> 00:28:22.187
you want to work for a
particular bank or whatever it

00:28:22.187 --> 00:28:26.449
happens to be,
it's also about whether you are

00:28:26.449 --> 00:28:30.586
a good worker or not.
So let's try and think about

00:28:30.586 --> 00:28:34.308
this in the context of not only
workers being boring or not,

00:28:34.308 --> 00:28:37.914
but workers being good or not.
So we're going to look at a

00:28:37.914 --> 00:28:40.894
costly signaling model.
It's going to turn out,

00:28:40.894 --> 00:28:44.212
this model's going to be about
costly signaling,

00:28:44.212 --> 00:28:48.661
and just for the purpose of the
model we're going to assume that

00:28:48.661 --> 00:28:51.980
there are two kinds of workers
in America.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:57.864
There are good workers,
we'll call them G,

00:28:57.864 --> 00:29:05.039
and there are bad workers and
we'll call them B.

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:08.668
We'll assume that the
productivity of a good worker,

00:29:08.668 --> 00:29:12.570
if you work for this firm,
is going to be 50 and we can

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:16.324
assume this is $50,000 or
whatever but let's just forget

00:29:16.324 --> 00:29:18.849
units for now and just call it
50.

00:29:18.849 --> 00:29:25.140
A bad worker,
their productivity is only 30.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.740
So clearly, all other things
being equal, the employer would

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.670
rather employ a good worker than
a bad worker.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:34.116
All other things being equal is
important because then we have

00:29:34.116 --> 00:29:37.541
to pay the good worker more.
Let's assume this is the U.S.

00:29:37.541 --> 00:29:42.289
economy, so roughly 10% of the
economy are good workers and 90%

00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:45.046
are bad workers,
something like that,

00:29:45.046 --> 00:29:48.569
and these are the proportions
in the U.S.

00:29:48.569 --> 00:29:52.180
Let's also assume that firms
are competitive.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.426
So firms are flooding into the
Yale Careers Office,

00:29:54.426 --> 00:29:56.807
or the Yale Careers Fair,
and they're just desperately

00:29:56.807 --> 00:29:59.907
trying to hire these workers.
There's competitive hiring

00:29:59.907 --> 00:30:08.930
going on.
So firms compete for workers.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:18.160
So they're going to pay 50 to a
worker they identify as good.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:28.695
They pay 50 to a worker,
they the firms identify as

00:30:28.695 --> 00:30:33.339
good.
And they're going to pay 30 to

00:30:33.339 --> 00:30:37.754
workers they identify as bad.
If you're bothered by this

00:30:37.754 --> 00:30:39.861
being exact, think of it as 50
minus a penny,

00:30:39.861 --> 00:30:42.719
and 30 minus a penny.
It's not going to make any

00:30:42.719 --> 00:30:46.496
difference to the analysis.
So if they can't identify a

00:30:46.496 --> 00:30:50.440
worker, they think the worker's
just the average worker,

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.380
how much will the competitive
wage be?

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.602
What will be the competitive
wage of the average worker in

00:30:56.602 --> 00:31:01.299
this economy?
It's not a hard math question.

00:31:01.299 --> 00:31:03.440
Everyone's scratching their
head down here.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:10.510
So this is 50 x 10% and 30 x
90%, which averages out as?

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:14.736
32% all right.
So they'll pay the average

00:31:14.736 --> 00:31:20.550
which is 32 to a worker they
cannot identify.

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:32.221
Now, clearly in this model,
much like in the high cost

00:31:32.221 --> 00:31:36.176
firms we started with,
the good workers would like to

00:31:36.176 --> 00:31:39.599
be identified because they get
paid more.

00:31:39.599 --> 00:31:44.011
The bad workers do not want to
be identified,

00:31:44.011 --> 00:31:48.036
they'd rather remain hidden.
The problem here,

00:31:48.036 --> 00:31:51.263
however, is there typically
isn't a verifiable piece of

00:31:51.263 --> 00:31:53.522
information.
It's hard to verifiably

00:31:53.522 --> 00:31:56.900
communicate to the other side
that you're a good worker.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.980
So you guys are all good
workers right.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.859
You wouldn't be here otherwise,
we hope.

00:32:00.859 --> 00:32:04.601
So you show up to this firm,
this firm is looking for good

00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:08.539
workers, and you could tell the
firm: "I'm a good worker."

00:32:08.539 --> 00:32:11.662
In fact I'm betting most of you
have tried doing that in your

00:32:11.662 --> 00:32:13.640
job interviews:
"I'm a good worker."

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.150
You could even do this in a
costly manner.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:19.980
You could humiliate yourself by
jumping up on the table and

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.943
dancing on one leg while singing
some song about how you're a

00:32:23.943 --> 00:32:27.278
good worker,
which would be humiliating but

00:32:27.278 --> 00:32:31.910
it wouldn't in fact communicate
to the firm that you're a good

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:34.347
worker.
Why is it that you're dancing

00:32:34.347 --> 00:32:37.529
this beautiful jig on the table
of the interview room,

00:32:37.529 --> 00:32:40.511
singing this beautiful song
about how you're a good worker,

00:32:40.511 --> 00:32:43.750
why doesn't that convince the
firm that you're a good worker?

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.648
Who's been in job interviews
recently?

00:32:45.648 --> 00:32:53.017
Has anyone tried this?
Why is that not a successful

00:32:53.017 --> 00:32:56.250
strategy?
Steven, is that right?

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.960
Student: Yes.
A bad worker could do that too.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.322
Professor Ben Polak:
A bad worker could do that

00:33:01.322 --> 00:33:02.949
too.
So it's true that it's costly

00:33:02.949 --> 00:33:05.714
and humiliating to dance up on
the table on one leg and sing

00:33:05.714 --> 00:33:08.396
you're a good worker,
but it's no more costly and

00:33:08.396 --> 00:33:11.220
humiliating for you than it is
for a bad worker.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.569
So if that worked,
a bad worker would do it too.

00:33:14.569 --> 00:33:21.190
So merely a song and dance
isn't going to work.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:25.791
It's going to be hard to signal
to the outside world that you're

00:33:25.791 --> 00:33:28.330
a good worker.
That's going to be our starting

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:28.640
point.

00:33:39.579 --> 00:33:43.822
So we need a way for good
workers to distinguish

00:33:43.822 --> 00:33:48.279
themselves from bad workers.
We need a way for them to

00:33:48.279 --> 00:33:52.269
signal, and what's key about
that signal is it has to be a

00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:56.329
signal that they can make and a
bad worker cannot make,

00:33:56.329 --> 00:34:00.399
or alternatively,
a signal that they will want to

00:34:00.399 --> 00:34:04.299
make but a bad worker will not
want to make.

00:34:04.299 --> 00:34:08.339
So dancing on the table doesn't
do it, and the reason it doesn't

00:34:08.339 --> 00:34:11.865
do it is bad workers and good
workers are symmetric with

00:34:11.865 --> 00:34:15.199
respect to the dishonor of
dancing on the table.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:18.268
So we need a way for good
workers, you guys,

00:34:18.268 --> 00:34:21.980
to distinguish yourself from
bad workers, us guys.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.801
How in the American economy,
what's the main way in the

00:34:25.801 --> 00:34:29.906
American economy in which good
workers signal the fact that

00:34:29.906 --> 00:34:32.047
they're good,
that they manage to distinguish

00:34:32.047 --> 00:34:35.403
themselves.
What's the main signal used in

00:34:35.403 --> 00:34:37.200
the U.S.
economy?

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.199
Somebody?
Yes, education.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:50.182
So the main signal in the U.S.,
not the only one by any means,

00:34:50.182 --> 00:34:55.909
but the main signal is
education.

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:59.489
What's going to distinguish the
good workers from the bad

00:34:59.489 --> 00:35:03.070
workers is the good workers are
going to have degrees,

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.056
more degrees,
better degrees,

00:35:05.056 --> 00:35:06.829
more degrees,
whatever.

00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:09.202
So what we're going to look at
today is a model some of you

00:35:09.202 --> 00:35:11.820
have seen before but we'll do it
in a bit more detail perhaps.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.303
It's a model due to a guy
called Spence,

00:35:15.303 --> 00:35:18.696
Mike Spence,
who actually won the Nobel

00:35:18.696 --> 00:35:22.179
Prize in large part for this
model.

00:35:22.179 --> 00:35:24.704
The reason we know he won the
Nobel Prize in large part for

00:35:24.704 --> 00:35:27.230
this model is he didn't write
practically anything else,

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:29.260
so it must have been for this
model.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.864
So what we're going to do is
we're going to imagine that the

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:36.469
degree, the education that these
people are going to get,

00:35:36.469 --> 00:35:39.179
that's going to distinguish
themselves and show that they're

00:35:39.179 --> 00:35:41.521
good workers to the
employers--let's assume that the

00:35:41.521 --> 00:35:44.138
employers once again are banks
or whatever--we're going to

00:35:44.138 --> 00:35:46.893
assume that the extra piece of
education they're going to get

00:35:46.893 --> 00:35:48.719
is an MBA.
Some of you out there are

00:35:48.719 --> 00:35:50.550
getting an MBA.
Where's my MBA? There he is.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:54.713
There's my MBA student up there.
So the good workers are going

00:35:54.713 --> 00:35:59.107
to get an MBA,
and the way this is going to

00:35:59.107 --> 00:36:05.280
work, it's going to work on the
costs of getting an MBA.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.637
So to get to this to be a
successful signal,

00:36:07.637 --> 00:36:10.651
to make this signal different
from merely dancing on the

00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:13.171
table,
it's either got to be the case

00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:17.115
that bad workers cannot get an
MBA or it's got to be the case

00:36:17.115 --> 00:36:20.926
that it's so costly for bad
workers to get an MBA that they

00:36:20.926 --> 00:36:24.062
won't bother.
So we're going to make the

00:36:24.062 --> 00:36:33.095
difference in costs.
So we're going to suppose that

00:36:33.095 --> 00:36:47.011
the cost per year of getting an
MBA, of being in business

00:36:47.011 --> 00:36:59.187
school, MBA education,
is 5 units if you're a good

00:36:59.187 --> 00:37:05.350
worker.
We're going to assume that the

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:11.606
cost per year of going to SOM
and getting an MBA is a little

00:37:11.606 --> 00:37:17.650
bit over 10, so 10 and a penny
if you're a bad worker.

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:23.095
So notice I've assumed in this
model that it's more costly per

00:37:23.095 --> 00:37:28.451
year to get an MBA at Yale say,
if you're a bad worker than a

00:37:28.451 --> 00:37:31.780
good worker.
Now, what are those costs?

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.489
What are the costs of getting
an MBA?

00:37:34.489 --> 00:37:37.090
What's causing that cost
difference?

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:40.550
Well let's be clear what it
isn't.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.956
It can't be the fees.
The fees are a large part of

00:37:42.956 --> 00:37:44.967
the costs.
What are the fees of getting an

00:37:44.967 --> 00:37:47.409
MBA at Yale this year?
Way too much right.

00:37:47.409 --> 00:37:50.493
So the costs per year in terms
of fees are enormous,

00:37:50.493 --> 00:37:53.878
but the fees themselves are not
going to do a good job of

00:37:53.878 --> 00:37:56.780
distinguishing between good and
bad workers.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.063
Why?
Because they're the same for

00:38:00.063 --> 00:38:03.005
both parties.
We want something which is

00:38:03.005 --> 00:38:06.580
differently costly,
so this is not the fees.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:11.049
It can't be the fees.
They're the same for both

00:38:11.049 --> 00:38:13.326
parties.
What other costs are there to

00:38:13.326 --> 00:38:14.500
getting an education?

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.771
There's opportunity costs right.
All of you are economists--or

00:38:20.771 --> 00:38:23.438
half of you are economics
majors--so the first thing that

00:38:23.438 --> 00:38:25.630
should spring to mind is
opportunity costs.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:29.098
But actually opportunity costs
don't help me here much because

00:38:29.098 --> 00:38:32.623
if anything you'd think that the
opportunity costs of going and

00:38:32.623 --> 00:38:35.806
getting an MBA at Yale are
higher if you're a good worker

00:38:35.806 --> 00:38:39.354
than if you're a bad worker.
After all, if you're a good

00:38:39.354 --> 00:38:41.865
worker you could stay home,
not get an MBA,

00:38:41.865 --> 00:38:45.203
farm your parent's garden,
and, since you're such a good

00:38:45.203 --> 00:38:48.300
worker, you'd have a high yield
in carrots or whatever.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.782
Whereas, the bad workers will
not produce anything,

00:38:51.782 --> 00:38:53.379
right?
So this is not really about

00:38:53.379 --> 00:38:55.073
opportunity costs,
in fact, we'll assume that

00:38:55.073 --> 00:38:55.690
they're zero.

00:38:59.219 --> 00:39:01.409
We'll assume there are no
opportunity costs.

00:39:01.409 --> 00:39:06.439
So what is it that's driving
this cost difference between the

00:39:06.439 --> 00:39:10.380
good worker at SOM and the bad
worker at SOM?

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:15.989
Was that a potential answer out
there?

00:39:15.989 --> 00:39:19.587
Student: Is it the
present value of future wages

00:39:19.587 --> 00:39:21.780
for a good worker?
Professor Ben Polak:

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.309
Okay, so there we're thinking
about the future.

00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:25.280
No, let's just focus on the
cost side.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.601
You're right there's going to
be different things going on in

00:39:27.601 --> 00:39:29.420
the future, but let's focus on
the cost side.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.340
I had you before so let's have
this guy.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.932
Student: Mental effort.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:39:33.932 --> 00:39:34.530
Mental effort,
right.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:37.130
So where's my MBA student up
there.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:38.750
Here he is--where is he,
up there.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.730
It's pain and suffering,
is that right?

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:45.849
I can't see him yet.
He's nodding, good.

00:39:45.849 --> 00:39:49.268
It's having--when you go to the
MBA class--of thinking my God,

00:39:49.268 --> 00:39:52.070
thank goodness I escaped being
an undergraduate,

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.912
and you go back to the MBA
class and I'm there

00:39:54.912 --> 00:39:56.747
again.
I'm assigning the same horrible

00:39:56.747 --> 00:39:59.541
problem sets and you still can't
read my handwriting and you've

00:39:59.541 --> 00:40:01.480
still got to deal with my
accent, right?

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.189
Good workers find it easier to
read my handwriting and deal

00:40:04.189 --> 00:40:05.310
with my accent,
right?

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:09.170
So what it is?
It's the mental effort.

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:16.820
It's the pain and suffering.
It's the pain of the work.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:20.465
The only thing that
distinguishes the costs of good

00:40:20.465 --> 00:40:24.693
workers from bad workers in
education is it's so painful to

00:40:24.693 --> 00:40:27.860
do the work.
If we went to a party school,

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.821
this wouldn't work.
That's why we can't just have

00:40:30.821 --> 00:40:33.122
party schools.
We actually have to put you

00:40:33.122 --> 00:40:35.099
through some pain in the
classroom.

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:38.320
I'm looking for some
confirmation from up there.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:45.070
So the pain of the work is what
distinguishes these things.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:50.248
Now I claim that we can have an
equilibrium in this society in

00:40:50.248 --> 00:40:53.559
which there are good and bad
workers;

00:40:53.559 --> 00:40:57.882
in which good workers cost per
year is less than bad workers

00:40:57.882 --> 00:41:00.476
cost per year of getting,
in this case,

00:41:00.476 --> 00:41:03.276
an MBA--we could do the same
for undergraduate education but

00:41:03.276 --> 00:41:06.969
let's focus on the MBA for now.
I claim there's an equilibrium

00:41:06.969 --> 00:41:10.090
in this society,
there could be an equilibrium

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.210
in which getting an MBA takes
three years.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:28.147
So I claim there is an
equilibrium here in which what

00:41:28.147 --> 00:41:35.829
happens?
In which there are three year

00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:45.614
degrees, degrees take three
years--a three year MBA sounds a

00:41:45.614 --> 00:41:54.901
bit frightening but never
mind--in which the good workers

00:41:54.901 --> 00:42:02.530
all get MBA's and the bad
workers do not.

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:04.659
But to tell you this is an
equilibrium I need to do a

00:42:04.659 --> 00:42:06.460
little bit more,
so let me tell you one other

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.984
thing.
So I claim there's an

00:42:07.984 --> 00:42:10.585
equilibrium in which the degrees
take three years,

00:42:10.585 --> 00:42:14.630
all the good workers get MBA's,
all the bad workers do not get

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:20.012
MBA's, and what?
The employers identify MBA's as

00:42:20.012 --> 00:42:23.728
good workers.
To make this work it has to

00:42:23.728 --> 00:42:31.821
convince the employers.
So to make it work I need:

00:42:31.821 --> 00:42:46.935
and the employers identify MBA
equals good, and not-MBA equals

00:42:46.935 --> 00:42:50.394
bad.
So that's what I claim is an

00:42:50.394 --> 00:42:54.274
equilibrium here and what I want
to do is I want us to show that

00:42:54.274 --> 00:42:56.430
this actually is an equilibrium.

00:43:06.199 --> 00:43:10.535
Now then, this is a slightly
different kind of equilibrium to

00:43:10.535 --> 00:43:13.570
anything we've seen in the class
so far,

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:17.486
so I'm going to be a little
slow and nerdy about what we

00:43:17.486 --> 00:43:21.760
need to check to check that this
indeed is an equilibrium.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.264
So I'm going to leave some
space on the board and you

00:43:24.264 --> 00:43:27.249
should leave some space too.
So my claim is this is an

00:43:27.249 --> 00:43:30.480
equilibrium.
And we're doing guess and check.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.630
I did the guess for you and
we'll do the check together.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:39.909
To check, I claim,
I need to check two things.

00:43:39.909 --> 00:43:55.970
One, I need to check that no
type will deviate.

00:43:55.970 --> 00:44:00.050
So what do I mean by a type?
I mean types of worker.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.600
Neither the good types of
workers would want to deviate

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.020
nor the bad types of worker
would want to deviate.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.815
So this isn't new.
When we've checked equilibrium

00:44:09.815 --> 00:44:12.570
we've always checked that people
don't want to deviate.

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:15.265
The only slight difference here
is instead of checking that

00:44:15.265 --> 00:44:17.682
people won't want to
deviate I'm checking that

00:44:17.682 --> 00:44:19.960
types of people won't
want to deviate,

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.560
but basically the idea is the
same.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.341
Is that right?
The idea's the same,

00:44:23.341 --> 00:44:31.494
so this is not really new.
The new thing is I also need to

00:44:31.494 --> 00:44:45.652
check--actually I'll give myself
a bit more room here--I also

00:44:45.652 --> 00:44:56.035
need to check that the
employer's beliefs are

00:44:56.035 --> 00:45:06.890
consistent with the equilibrium
behavior.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.309
So let's just stop and pause at
that a second.

00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:15.606
We've never written down a
condition like this for

00:45:15.606 --> 00:45:18.788
equilibrium, but here I have to.
Here there was asymmetric

00:45:18.788 --> 00:45:22.010
information in the model.
And, in this equilibrium,

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:25.655
one important party to the
equilibrium, namely the guys who

00:45:25.655 --> 00:45:29.300
are going to employ you,
that's pretty important right?

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.885
All they really have to do in
this model, of any importance,

00:45:32.885 --> 00:45:35.619
is form an inference based on
your actions.

00:45:35.619 --> 00:45:39.071
They observe whether you get an
education or not and they

00:45:39.071 --> 00:45:42.400
conclude whether or not you're a
good or bad worker.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.743
So we're going to write down as
a condition of this being an

00:45:46.743 --> 00:45:50.349
equilibrium that those
inferences "make sense."

00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:54.083
By make sense I mean that
they're consistent with what

00:45:54.083 --> 00:45:56.829
actually is happening in
equilibrium.

00:45:56.829 --> 00:45:59.291
So before we get too nerdy
about that let's just think why

00:45:59.291 --> 00:46:00.889
that's a sensible thing to
require.

00:46:00.889 --> 00:46:03.745
Suppose, in fact,
suppose the world was like

00:46:03.745 --> 00:46:06.749
this.
All good workers got MBA's,

00:46:06.749 --> 00:46:11.922
all bad workers did not get
MBA's, and employers thought

00:46:11.922 --> 00:46:17.659
that the people who got MBA's
were half good and half bad.

00:46:17.659 --> 00:46:21.769
That just doesn't sound right,
right?

00:46:21.769 --> 00:46:24.514
If in fact it's the case,
that it's the good workers who

00:46:24.514 --> 00:46:27.110
are getting MBA's and the bad
workers who are not,

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:30.396
then the only belief that the
employers can have that's

00:46:30.396 --> 00:46:33.987
consistent is the MBA's are in
fact the good workers and the

00:46:33.987 --> 00:46:36.969
non-MBA's are the bad workers,
is that right?

00:46:36.969 --> 00:46:39.615
So I'm not making any deep
point here, I'm just pointing

00:46:39.615 --> 00:46:42.356
out that we need to make sure
that the beliefs that people

00:46:42.356 --> 00:46:45.194
hold in this equilibrium are
consistent with what's actually

00:46:45.194 --> 00:46:47.802
going on in the equilibrium.
But having said that,

00:46:47.802 --> 00:46:49.840
there's no mystery here,
everything's fine.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.749
In this particular claim of an
equilibrium, good workers are

00:46:52.749 --> 00:46:55.781
the ones who got the MBA's;
bad workers are the ones who

00:46:55.781 --> 00:46:58.434
didn't get the MBA's;
and the employers,

00:46:58.434 --> 00:47:02.230
when they see an MBA,
indeed think they're good;

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:05.840
and, when they see a non-MBA,
they indeed think they're bad.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:10.379
So these beliefs are in fact
consistent with behavior,

00:47:10.379 --> 00:47:13.501
so we're okay.
Okay, so I've had to check that

00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:16.164
but it wasn't a big deal.
Everyone okay about why I'm

00:47:16.164 --> 00:47:17.894
checking it?
I don't want people to hold

00:47:17.894 --> 00:47:20.202
silly beliefs at equilibrium,
that's basically what I'm

00:47:20.202 --> 00:47:22.730
saying.
All right, now let's go back

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:26.179
and check the sort of bread and
butter thing.

00:47:26.179 --> 00:47:29.922
The bread and butter thing is
we need to check that no type of

00:47:29.922 --> 00:47:33.420
worker is going to want to
deviate in this equilibrium.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.498
So there's two types of worker.
There's good workers--and good

00:47:37.498 --> 00:47:41.289
workers, what are they doing in
equilibrium?

00:47:41.289 --> 00:47:42.650
What are the good workers doing
in equilibrium?

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:48.000
They're getting an MBA.
So the good workers,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.656
they become MBA's,
and what are the good workers

00:47:52.656 --> 00:47:55.830
identified as?
Once they got an MBA what does

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:59.580
the employer identify them as?
Good workers, right?

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:03.900
They're identified as good.
They get MBA's.

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:13.550
They're identified as good,
and their payoff is what?

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:16.280
What's the payoff of the good
workers here?

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:20.857
So they get paid 50 which is
their productivity,

00:48:20.857 --> 00:48:27.090
but it costs them three years
of putting up with my homeworks.

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:33.000
So it costs them 3 x 5,
five for each year.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:40.039
So 50 - 3 x 5 is what?
35, good.

00:48:40.039 --> 00:48:45.519
So they get a total payoff of
35, and let me just pause a

00:48:45.519 --> 00:48:47.242
second.
I made an assumption here

00:48:47.242 --> 00:48:48.860
without telling you it,
so I'm going to say it.

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.951
Just to make the math simple
we'll assume that once you get

00:48:52.951 --> 00:48:56.760
employed you work for a year and
then you drop dead.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.311
That's a slightly morbid and
unpleasant assumption,

00:48:59.311 --> 00:49:02.322
but otherwise we have to do
kind of present discounted value

00:49:02.322 --> 00:49:05.537
of your whole future income and
then it turns into an accounting

00:49:05.537 --> 00:49:07.272
class.
So we'll just assume that

00:49:07.272 --> 00:49:09.690
everybody lives for one year.
If you want to do a more

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:12.500
complicated model then that's
fine, the idea will be the same.

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.811
So they get paid 50,
it's cost them 3 x 5,

00:49:15.811 --> 00:49:18.720
and they get a total payoff of
35.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:24.370
How about if they deviate?
If they deviate that means they

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:28.610
don't get MBA's.
So they're not MBA's.

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:32.890
They're identified as what?
If they don't get an MBA,

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:37.893
what are they identified as?
What does the employer think

00:49:37.893 --> 00:49:39.884
the non-MBA's are?
Bad.

00:49:39.884 --> 00:49:43.650
So if they deviate then the
employers think they're bad.

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.982
Even if they dance on the table
and say they're good,

00:49:45.982 --> 00:49:48.180
they're in fact bad--they're
identified as bad.

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:54.430
And so their payoff is what?
What are they going to get paid?

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:58.524
They're going to get paid 30.
And sure enough 35 is bigger

00:49:58.524 --> 00:50:02.300
than 30, so they're not going to
want to deviate.

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:06.940
So that's good news.
What about the bad workers?

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:11.036
Let's check them.
So the bad workers,

00:50:11.036 --> 00:50:14.310
in equilibrium,
they're not MBA's.

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:19.510
They don't get an MBA.
They're identified as bad.

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:24.505
And they're paid what?
What are they paid these bad

00:50:24.505 --> 00:50:28.130
workers?
Somebody?

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.380
They're paid 30.
They're paid their productivity.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.925
So their payoff is just 30.
They didn't get an education so

00:50:34.925 --> 00:50:36.991
it was free.
They get 30 for free,

00:50:36.991 --> 00:50:40.984
so their payoff is just 30.
If they deviate,

00:50:40.984 --> 00:50:46.750
if the bad workers deviate,
then they get an MBA.

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:50.164
So here come the bad workers.
They find their way into my

00:50:50.164 --> 00:50:52.750
class in SOM.
They have a miserable time.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:57.154
(I have a miserable time
because they're having a

00:50:57.154 --> 00:51:02.934
miserable time.) But at the end
of the day they're identified as

00:51:02.934 --> 00:51:06.880
good workers and hence they're
paid 50.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:20.700
And their payoff is 50 - 3 x
10.01 which is approximately 20.

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:25.115
Is that right?
So they don't want to deviate

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:28.390
either and now I'm done,
I've shown it's an equilibrium.

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:31.302
So just to recap.
To show that this was an

00:51:31.302 --> 00:51:35.981
equilibrium, I had to show that
the good workers happily self

00:51:35.981 --> 00:51:40.271
select into education and don't
want to deviate and skip

00:51:40.271 --> 00:51:43.989
business school.
I have to show that the bad

00:51:43.989 --> 00:51:48.457
workers self select into not
getting an education and don't

00:51:48.457 --> 00:51:51.230
want to deviate and become
MBA's.

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:55.358
And I have to show that the
employers infer from this what

00:51:55.358 --> 00:51:58.690
they should infer from this,
which was fine.

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:01.719
So I'm done.
This is indeed an equilibrium.

00:52:01.719 --> 00:52:05.823
So notice, in this equilibrium,
the good workers do manage to

00:52:05.823 --> 00:52:08.969
distinguish themselves from the
bad workers,

00:52:08.969 --> 00:52:12.099
and they do end up getting paid
more (albeit at the cost that

00:52:12.099 --> 00:52:14.030
they're going to die a year
later).

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:23.585
So this is called a separating
equilibrium--which I can never

00:52:23.585 --> 00:52:26.333
spell.
I'm probably spelling this

00:52:26.333 --> 00:52:27.300
wrong.
It's a separating equilibrium.

00:52:32.099 --> 00:52:34.329
Why is it called a separating
equilibrium?

00:52:34.329 --> 00:52:38.136
It's called a separating
equilibrium because the types

00:52:38.136 --> 00:52:41.010
manage to separate and get
identified.

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:44.499
That's slightly misleading.
The good types manage to

00:52:44.499 --> 00:52:47.833
separate and get identified,
and the bad types,

00:52:47.833 --> 00:52:51.312
they don't want to get
separated, but they do get

00:52:51.312 --> 00:52:54.449
separated.
Now, how many of you have seen

00:52:54.449 --> 00:52:57.250
some version of the Spence model
before?

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:59.821
Some of you,
let's go into this in a little

00:52:59.821 --> 00:53:03.190
bit more detail to see if we've
really understood it.

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:26.219
So in particular could we get
away with a shorter degree?

00:53:26.219 --> 00:53:30.800
Here we had people going to get
MBA's and it took them three

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.756
years each.
That seems an awful long time

00:53:34.756 --> 00:53:45.230
to get an MBA.
So how about a one year MBA.

00:53:49.369 --> 00:53:52.225
Some of you might think this is
a somewhat abstract example but

00:53:52.225 --> 00:53:54.805
actually this is the kind of
thing you hear about all the

00:53:54.805 --> 00:53:56.898
time.
If you listen to ads in the

00:53:56.898 --> 00:53:59.572
education press you keep on
hearing schools,

00:53:59.572 --> 00:54:02.619
perhaps schools who lack
Economics professors,

00:54:02.619 --> 00:54:06.590
putting up the proposals for
one year MBA degrees.

00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:09.647
I won't mention any schools by
name because I'll probably get

00:54:09.647 --> 00:54:13.530
in trouble.
So how about a one year MBA?

00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:16.604
Let's see if that will work.
And we'll allow good workers to

00:54:16.604 --> 00:54:18.559
separate themselves from bad
workers.

00:54:18.559 --> 00:54:22.385
Let's assume that the costs per
year are the same as they were

00:54:22.385 --> 00:54:25.070
before.
And let's suppose that this

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:28.839
candidate equilibrium,
this putative equilibrium,

00:54:28.839 --> 00:54:32.530
involves the good workers
getting the MBA's;

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:34.719
the bad workers not getting an
MBA;

00:54:34.719 --> 00:54:37.126
and the employers,
just as before,

00:54:37.126 --> 00:54:40.699
identifying MBA's as good and
non-MBA's as bad.

00:54:40.699 --> 00:54:47.490
Question: is that an
equilibrium?

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:50.800
So who thinks yes?
Who thinks no?

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.150
So you can all tell my why then.
So the answer is no.

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:57.489
So why is that not an
equilibrium?

00:54:57.489 --> 00:55:01.440
Somebody, anybody?
Someone who hasn't answered yet.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:04.940
Your name is?
Student: Asman.

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.369
Professor Ben Polak:
Asman, so shout out.

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:10.714
Student: The bad workers
would also benefit from doing

00:55:10.714 --> 00:55:14.190
the MBA because their payoff is
still greater.

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:16.565
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so what's wrong in this

00:55:16.565 --> 00:55:18.559
equilibrium, it's not the
employer's beliefs.

00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:22.363
If in fact people did follow
this behavior then employers

00:55:22.363 --> 00:55:25.420
would be right to identify MBA's
with good.

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:28.230
It's also not the good workers
problem.

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:31.463
If in fact, employers are going
to pay more to MBA's,

00:55:31.463 --> 00:55:35.007
then the good workers are even
more so going to want to go

00:55:35.007 --> 00:55:42.432
ahead and get MBA's.
The problem here--this is not

00:55:42.432 --> 00:55:53.070
an equilibrium--and the problem
is the bad workers.

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:55.350
The bad workers' incentives are
wrong here.

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:59.172
Why?
Because if the bad workers do

00:55:59.172 --> 00:56:03.613
what they're supposed to do in
this equilibrium--actually it

00:56:03.613 --> 00:56:07.670
isn't an equilibrium,
but in this supposed

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:14.084
equilibrium--what they're
supposed to do is not get an MBA

00:56:14.084 --> 00:56:20.083
and get a payoff of 30.
But if they went and got an

00:56:20.083 --> 00:56:25.205
MBA, if they deviate and no one
else deviates,

00:56:25.205 --> 00:56:30.555
just them deviating,
if they deviate they get an

00:56:30.555 --> 00:56:33.605
MBA.
According to the equilibrium,

00:56:33.605 --> 00:56:36.400
they're now identified as good
workers.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:44.947
They're identified as good so
their payoff would be 50 minus

00:56:44.947 --> 00:56:53.059
one year at approximately 10 for
a total payoff of 40.

00:56:53.059 --> 00:56:56.904
But 40 is higher than 30 so
that's violated our equilibrium

00:56:56.904 --> 00:56:59.110
condition.
Everyone see that?

00:56:59.110 --> 00:57:02.717
So here the bad workers,
if it only took one year of

00:57:02.717 --> 00:57:06.750
pain and suffering to get an
MBA, the bad workers would go

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:10.436
and get an MBA as well.
And that would be trouble

00:57:10.436 --> 00:57:14.984
because now everyone gets an MBA
and its just like dancing on the

00:57:14.984 --> 00:57:18.969
table again.
So how long must an MBA be?

00:57:18.969 --> 00:57:21.620
In this model,
with this cost structure,

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.610
how many years must it take to
get an MBA?

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:31.065
Two years, right?
One year didn't work but you

00:57:31.065 --> 00:57:39.789
can try at home and check that a
two year MBA will work.

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:43.760
Two years will be just enough
to put off the bad workers.

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.429
Leaving aside the numbers
though, what's the idea here?

00:57:47.429 --> 00:57:51.853
The idea is that to work as a
successful signal,

00:57:51.853 --> 00:57:57.030
the signal has to separate the
good workers from the bad

00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:00.034
workers.
The workers have to choose to

00:58:00.034 --> 00:58:02.972
be separated.
They have to self select into

00:58:02.972 --> 00:58:07.108
being MBA's or not being MBA's,
and we need just enough pain

00:58:07.108 --> 00:58:10.402
and suffering--and let's be
careful--just enough

00:58:10.402 --> 00:58:14.397
difference in pain and
suffering for the workers to

00:58:14.397 --> 00:58:20.013
select correctly.
So what we need,

00:58:20.013 --> 00:58:34.762
we need enough difference in
cost for good workers to get the

00:58:34.762 --> 00:58:47.300
degree and for bad workers not
to want to do so.

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.960
So one thing we could do is
have a two year degree.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:54.185
If you absolutely insisted on
having a one year degree,

00:58:54.185 --> 00:58:57.232
how could you create a
difference in cost that would

00:58:57.232 --> 00:58:59.732
work?
Suppose you were employed to

00:58:59.732 --> 00:59:03.096
advise some university out in
the west somewhere,

00:59:03.096 --> 00:59:06.460
who wanted to have a one year
degree program.

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:10.198
What should you do in that one
year degree program to make it

00:59:10.198 --> 00:59:12.940
work, to make it allow people to
separate?

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:15.901
Raising tuition isn't going to
work because that's the same for

00:59:15.901 --> 00:59:18.096
good and bad workers.
You need a way to separate the

00:59:18.096 --> 00:59:19.900
good and bad workers.
How are you going to do it?

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:22.239
You're going to make it really
hard.

00:59:22.239 --> 00:59:24.658
If you want to have one year
degree program,

00:59:24.658 --> 00:59:28.078
it's got to be really hard.
You've got to really jack up

00:59:28.078 --> 00:59:31.335
the difference between the good
and the bad workers,

00:59:31.335 --> 00:59:35.550
so you need to hire professors
who have really bad handwriting.

00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:42.510
Let's try and take a step back
from this model and see what

00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:45.851
we've learned here.
Let's just try and draw some

00:59:45.851 --> 00:59:46.380
lessons off this.

00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:55.369
I want to draw two kinds of
lessons.

00:59:55.369 --> 00:59:59.344
I want to draw lessons in
general about what makes a

00:59:59.344 --> 01:00:04.021
successful signal in society,
and then I want to draw lessons

01:00:04.021 --> 01:00:06.737
about education.
So I want to start with some

01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:09.299
nerdy lessons about Game Theory
if you like, and then I want to

01:00:09.299 --> 01:00:11.530
want to talk about some more
specific lessons about the

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:12.440
education system.

01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:28.119
So the key lesson here is the
lesson we just learned.

01:00:28.119 --> 01:00:31.958
The key lesson is:
to be a successful signal,

01:00:31.958 --> 01:00:37.105
to be able to separate types of
people, you need there to be

01:00:37.105 --> 01:00:47.963
large differences in costs.
So the first lesson is a good

01:00:47.963 --> 01:01:03.147
signal--it isn't that it has to
be costly--it has to be

01:01:03.147 --> 01:01:15.800
differentially costly
across types.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.604
The reason is you want the
types to self select,

01:01:18.604 --> 01:01:21.110
so there better be differences
in costs.

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:25.298
Be a little bit careful here:
you could have differences in

01:01:25.298 --> 01:01:28.620
benefits but we'll leave it as
cost for now.

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:29.490
That's one lesson.

01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:39.199
Now what's that telling us in
this model?

01:01:39.199 --> 01:01:41.926
That's telling us that if you
make it very,

01:01:41.926 --> 01:01:44.848
very easy to obtain
qualifications in the U.S.

01:01:44.848 --> 01:01:48.224
society, for example,
if you lower the standards that

01:01:48.224 --> 01:01:52.185
you need to get a high school
degree and perhaps you lower the

01:01:52.185 --> 01:01:55.821
standards to get a college
degree--I'm not saying that is

01:01:55.821 --> 01:01:57.692
happening,
I don't want to take a

01:01:57.692 --> 01:01:59.266
political position on this.
In England that's happening.

01:01:59.266 --> 01:02:00.506
I can do that.
In England that seems to be

01:02:00.506 --> 01:02:02.429
happening.
So you lower the standards it

01:02:02.429 --> 01:02:05.119
takes to get a high school
certificate in England,

01:02:05.119 --> 01:02:07.484
and then you perhaps lower the
standards to get a college

01:02:07.484 --> 01:02:09.300
degree, what are you going to
see happen?

01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:16.530
You're going to see
qualification inflation.

01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:19.161
If you make it easy for
everybody to get the first

01:02:19.161 --> 01:02:22.383
degree, the good workers are
going to go on and have to get a

01:02:22.383 --> 01:02:24.553
second degree.
If you make it easy to get the

01:02:24.553 --> 01:02:26.317
second degree,
they're going to go on and get

01:02:26.317 --> 01:02:29.126
the third degree.
So what this model predicts is

01:02:29.126 --> 01:02:32.805
if you get rid of this cost
difference then workers will

01:02:32.805 --> 01:02:36.349
find a new way to raise the cost
difference again.

01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:40.472
The way that takes place,
at least in some economies,

01:02:40.472 --> 01:02:44.120
is you start seeing
qualification inflation.

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:53.518
By qualification inflation I
mean that, pretty soon,

01:02:53.518 --> 01:02:57.819
even to drive a dump truck you
need to have a university

01:02:57.819 --> 01:03:00.484
degree.
Okay, now what are the lessons

01:03:00.484 --> 01:03:02.590
here for education more
generally?

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:16.776
This is a pretty sparse model
of education but all of you,

01:03:16.776 --> 01:03:20.091
and more immediately me,
are involved in the education

01:03:20.091 --> 01:03:22.095
system.
So we should care about it a

01:03:22.095 --> 01:03:23.359
bit.
It's probably the most famous

01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:25.948
model of education.
As I say, it won somebody the

01:03:25.948 --> 01:03:28.495
Nobel Prize.
What is it telling us about

01:03:28.495 --> 01:03:32.636
education?
So the first thing I claim,

01:03:32.636 --> 01:03:40.550
I claim that this is a rather
pessimistic model of education.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:43.880
Why is this a pessimistic model
of education?

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.470
What's pessimistic about this
model?

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:49.720
Let's talk about that a bit.
Anybody, some hands up?

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.483
Some different hands?
Why is this a pessimistic model

01:03:52.483 --> 01:03:54.096
of education?
Way over there,

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:57.721
a hand in another part of the
room, that will give the camera

01:03:57.721 --> 01:04:00.200
a work out anyway.
Student: You won't learn

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.074
anything as a rule,
as that school has absolutely

01:04:02.074 --> 01:04:03.928
no value for education.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:04:03.928 --> 01:04:05.760
Good, so shout it into the
microphone, but that was right.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.645
Student: You don't learn
anything at school in this

01:04:07.645 --> 01:04:09.283
model.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:04:09.283 --> 01:04:11.369
Right, this is a model with no
learning.

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:13.929
There's no learning in this
model.

01:04:13.929 --> 01:04:18.257
In fact, people in this model
go in with their productivities

01:04:18.257 --> 01:04:22.656
at 50 and 30 and they come out
with their productivities at 50

01:04:22.656 --> 01:04:24.886
and 30.
Nothing you do at school

01:04:24.886 --> 01:04:27.460
enriches you or makes you more
productive.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:29.309
That's a pretty pessimistic
lesson.

01:04:29.309 --> 01:04:31.719
Here we are in Lecture #23 or
something.

01:04:31.719 --> 01:04:34.968
And the message of this model
is, you guys haven't learned

01:04:34.968 --> 01:04:38.159
anything: you've just had a lot
of pain and suffering.

01:04:38.159 --> 01:04:47.570
So there's no learning in this
model.

01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:49.739
Now I hope that's not true as a
model of education.

01:04:49.739 --> 01:04:53.619
I hope it's not true that we
only have pain,

01:04:53.619 --> 01:04:57.499
but nevertheless,
let's pretend it's true at

01:04:57.499 --> 01:05:01.469
least for now and see where it
takes us.

01:05:01.469 --> 01:05:05.642
So a second observation of this
model, if we believe this model

01:05:05.642 --> 01:05:08.940
of education in which you don't
learn anything,

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.010
education is just being used by
those people who are good anyway

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:16.369
to separate from those people
who were bad anyway,

01:05:16.369 --> 01:05:22.860
then education in this model is
socially wasteful.

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.039
Why is education socially
wasteful in this model?

01:05:30.039 --> 01:05:31.840
In what sense is it socially
wasteful?

01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:37.429
Think of it from the point of
view of an economist?

01:05:37.429 --> 01:05:39.864
In this model,
the productivity of the workers

01:05:39.864 --> 01:05:41.920
doesn't change because of
education,

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:48.206
but some resources were used by
the good workers to get an

01:05:48.206 --> 01:05:51.130
education.
At the end of the day,

01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:53.530
the good workers are better
off.

01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:57.415
The bad workers are worse off
and employers are the same as

01:05:57.415 --> 01:06:01.769
they would have been otherwise,
but that's just redistribution.

01:06:01.769 --> 01:06:06.220
There's no product from
education but resources were

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:10.010
wasted in education.
Does that make sense?

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:12.533
So in particular,
in our two year equilibrium,

01:06:12.533 --> 01:06:15.618
or in our three equilibrium,
it was the good workers who

01:06:15.618 --> 01:06:18.440
went to college,
or in this case went to

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:22.949
business school and they wasted
three years at five a piece.

01:06:22.949 --> 01:06:27.522
So there's a waste of 15--a
waste of 10 in the two year

01:06:27.522 --> 01:06:29.644
model.
According to this model,

01:06:29.644 --> 01:06:32.975
education is socially wasteful.
How do we actually visualize

01:06:32.975 --> 01:06:35.814
that waste in society?
So let's take the model

01:06:35.814 --> 01:06:39.770
seriously, where is that waste
manifested in society?

01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:45.505
Where is that waste manifested?
So you guys aren't working,

01:06:45.505 --> 01:06:46.820
and where else is it
manifested?

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:48.460
You guys sitting here is part
of the waste.

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:50.522
You should be out doing
something else,

01:06:50.522 --> 01:06:52.329
and where else is the waste?
Me.

01:06:52.329 --> 01:06:55.864
You should take all your Yale
professors, stop using them as

01:06:55.864 --> 01:06:58.679
Yale professors and wasting
those resources,

01:06:58.679 --> 01:07:04.155
and have us go out and till the
fields or drive taxis or

01:07:04.155 --> 01:07:07.390
something.
So there's a social waste here

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:10.860
and what we should do is,
according to this model,

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:17.457
is we should send the
professors to drive taxis or

01:07:17.457 --> 01:07:22.192
dump trucks I guess.
I'm not claiming we'd be good

01:07:22.192 --> 01:07:25.010
at driving dump trucks.
Our comparative advantage is

01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:28.050
certainly in teaching classes
rather than driving dump trucks.

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:29.460
But it turns out that,
in this model,

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.380
teaching classes is completely
a waste of time,

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:35.674
and therefore you're better off
using those resources to drive

01:07:35.674 --> 01:07:39.539
dump trucks.
Third, notice that in this

01:07:39.539 --> 01:07:43.860
model the result of education is
what?

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:46.902
It's good for the good workers,
you guys managed to separate

01:07:46.902 --> 01:07:48.809
yourselves and get paid high
wages.

01:07:48.809 --> 01:07:51.293
That's nice for the Yale
graduates here,

01:07:51.293 --> 01:07:53.840
but who were the losers in this
model?

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:57.928
Who were the losers?
The bad workers,

01:07:57.928 --> 01:08:01.467
the 90% of workers in this
economy who aren't naturally

01:08:01.467 --> 01:08:04.809
gifted, who aren't going to find
education easy.

01:08:04.809 --> 01:08:07.469
They, in this model,
end up being paid 30.,

01:08:07.469 --> 01:08:11.079
Without the education system
how much would they have been

01:08:11.079 --> 01:08:12.840
paid?
32.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:17.270
So in this model education
increases inequality,

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:22.361
and it doesn't increase
inequality in a benign way just

01:08:22.361 --> 01:08:26.916
by making the rich richer.
It increases inequality by

01:08:26.916 --> 01:08:33.863
making the poor poorer.
Education, in this model

01:08:33.863 --> 01:08:44.962
increases inequality.
In this model it actually hurts

01:08:44.962 --> 01:08:48.061
the poor.
Now, that strikes me as a

01:08:48.061 --> 01:08:49.560
pretty important lesson
actually.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.640
Again, I don't think we should
take this model too literally.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.294
In the real world,
I at least hope that some of

01:08:55.294 --> 01:08:57.430
you are learning something at
Yale.

01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:59.452
You're looking extremely
doubtful that you could possibly

01:08:59.452 --> 01:09:01.005
learn anything at Yale,
so maybe you're not,

01:09:01.005 --> 01:09:02.507
I don't know.
But, in the real world,

01:09:02.507 --> 01:09:04.590
I'd like to believe people are
learning here at Yale.

01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:07.967
But one of the things that's
going on in education in

01:09:07.967 --> 01:09:11.215
addition to learning,
one of the things is that you

01:09:11.215 --> 01:09:15.177
guys are separating yourselves
and signaling to employers that

01:09:15.177 --> 01:09:18.229
you're going to be good workers
for them.

01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:21.400
As a consequence,
that's great for you but

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:26.149
someone else is being paid less.
This strikes me as an important

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:28.609
lesson to hear in an election
year.

01:09:28.609 --> 01:09:31.512
In every election year in
America--I've been in a few

01:09:31.512 --> 01:09:34.581
election years in America
now--there are two things that

01:09:34.581 --> 01:09:38.152
all politicians agree on,
whether they're far right or

01:09:38.152 --> 01:09:40.576
far left.
All politicians agree on two

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.211
things.
They agree that two things are

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.930
good.
One: kissing babies.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:49.499
Two: they all want to be "the
education President," is that

01:09:49.499 --> 01:09:51.850
right?
All of them, is that right?

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:54.587
Now, as a parent of some
babies, I'm not sure I want to

01:09:54.587 --> 01:09:57.729
have politicians' kissing babies
but that's for another day.

01:09:57.729 --> 01:10:01.331
The point here is what we're
learning--don't go yet

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:05.653
guys--what we're learning here
is that if education hurts the

01:10:05.653 --> 01:10:09.830
poor maybe we shouldn't be so
keen to decide that we should

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:13.000
subsidize the education sector
itself.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.522
Although, as an educator,
I hope you don't tell that to

01:10:15.522 --> 01:10:17.662
anybody.
What's the take away message of

01:10:17.662 --> 01:10:20.491
this model then?
The take away message is for

01:10:20.491 --> 01:10:24.314
education to work as a signaling
device, for education to

01:10:24.314 --> 01:10:26.840
generate a separating
equilibrium,

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.880
some children have to be left
behind.

01:10:34.659 --> 01:10:36.000
We'll talk about that more on
Wednesday.

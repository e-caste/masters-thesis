00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.694
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Welcome back to more

00:00:03.694 --> 00:00:05.644
of Astronomy 160.
The syllabus,

00:00:05.644 --> 00:00:09.250
if you haven't got it yet,
is on the classes server.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.605
We have extra copies but I have
to say I don't know where they

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:15.220
are, and in any case,
everything that you need to

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.170
know is on the classes server
and there's actually more than

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.420
is on the printed syllabus there
anywhere.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.197
Let me say a couple things;
we're going to stick to the

00:00:24.197 --> 00:00:28.211
rule that there should be no
science majors taking this

00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:30.320
class.
And from the looks of the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.606
enrollment, there's going to be
no problem for juniors and

00:00:33.606 --> 00:00:35.523
seniors.
I think we've got plenty of

00:00:35.523 --> 00:00:38.471
sections to accommodate everyone
in here, provided you're not a

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.635
science major.
But the way it's going to work

00:00:40.635 --> 00:00:42.760
in terms of signing up for the
class, I think,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.638
as I understand it,
is as follows:

00:00:44.638 --> 00:00:47.483
You need a section,
sections are mandatory for this

00:00:47.483 --> 00:00:49.629
course.
So, you have to go through the

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.811
online section sign up process.
That'll start on Monday but

00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:56.050
it'll only start for freshman
and sophomores on Monday.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.258
Juniors and seniors will be
able to sign up for the course

00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:04.540
and sign for sections on
Tuesday, and so please do that.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.810
Sections will start--sections
are going to be on Mondays,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.080
so they obviously won't start
next week they'll start the

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.936
following week.
I have no doubt looking around

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:17.545
the room that we're going to be
able to accommodate juniors and

00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:19.989
seniors if they want to take the
class.

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:23.149
All right, other things,
yes, the first problem set is

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.184
assigned as of today.
When I get back to my office

00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:28.860
I'll stick that on the classes
server as well,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.060
and you can pick it up from
there.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.304
It's due one week from today.
The way I like to do this,

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:40.215
I like to have problem sets due
at the start of class because it

00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:43.692
bugs me to look out and watch
people copying each other's

00:01:43.692 --> 00:01:46.216
problem sets.
So, you have to hand it in at

00:01:46.216 --> 00:01:48.349
the beginning of class otherwise
it's late.

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:50.977
On the classes server,
there's a whole little thing

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:53.500
about lateness policy which you
ought to read.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.371
And also something--let me make
a couple general remarks about

00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:01.831
problem sets.
The purpose of problem sets is

00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:05.450
different from the purpose of a
take-home test.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.171
This is not something where the
major purpose is to evaluate how

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:13.276
much you know.
The point of problem sets is to

00:02:13.276 --> 00:02:16.657
get you to actually do those
particular problems because

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:20.470
that's how one learns stuff in
this kind of subject matter.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.199
It's kind of like doing the
reading;

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.269
if you don't do it,
you're just going to have

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.402
trouble.
And so, the reason it's a

00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:30.325
substantial fraction of your
grade is just to make sure that

00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:34.259
you do it.
So, this has implications for

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:38.193
working in groups.
Working in groups is strongly

00:02:38.193 --> 00:02:40.550
encouraged.
Please do that.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.090
It's a very good thing,
make friends with the other

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.970
people in the class,
work together,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.640
talk to each other,
start early,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.430
and make use of each other's
intelligence.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.722
However, at the same time,
we want to make sure that you

00:02:54.722 --> 00:02:57.828
actually do things.
So, we want the work you hand

00:02:57.828 --> 00:03:00.770
in to be your own.
This sounds contradictory.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.300
On the one hand,
I'm tell you to work in groups;

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.485
on the other hand,
I'm telling you,

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:04.740
you have to hand in your own
work.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.721
What does that mean?
So, as is written down on the

00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.800
classes server,
the way we try and work this is

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.749
when you are actually writing
down the thing you're going to

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.270
hand in,
do that alone.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.383
So, if you work in a group,
figure out what you're doing,

00:03:19.383 --> 00:03:22.217
get everything all set up,
then split up and write down

00:03:22.217 --> 00:03:26.026
the answer, because the process
of actually writing the thing

00:03:26.026 --> 00:03:29.772
down yourself will make sure
that you've actually understood

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:32.889
what you were doing.
We'll check on this.

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.197
We'll look for identical
wording or identical

00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:38.134
multiplication mistakes and so
forth, and so we'll keep a

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:41.586
little bit of an eye on it.
I do encourage you to work in

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:43.690
groups.
There's other ways of getting

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.327
help if you need it.
The primary source of help are

00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:47.658
the sections,
but of course,

00:03:47.658 --> 00:03:50.367
those won't be meeting this
week so not before the first

00:03:50.367 --> 00:03:53.419
problem set is due.
Office hours;

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.449
I'll be in Starbucks Monday
from 9:30 to 11:00;

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:01.865
please come and say hello,
and ask any questions you might

00:04:01.865 --> 00:04:04.425
have.
The teaching fellows are going

00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:06.699
to have office hours on
Wednesdays;

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.925
conveniently located the day
before the problem sets are due

00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:13.439
you'll notice.
And let me strongly recommend,

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.399
don't send us email with
questions about it.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.870
Send things into the forum on
the classes server.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.366
That way--and look first on the
forum to see if somebody has

00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:27.610
sent your questions.
This works really well.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.509
We'll keep an eye on that all
the time.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.706
We'll be answering it--not all
the time, not probably after

00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:34.690
around 8:00 at night on
Wednesday.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.314
If you have a question at 2:00
in the morning the day before

00:04:37.314 --> 00:04:39.360
something is due you're kind of
on your own.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.601
Yes?
Student: Is that Monday

00:04:41.601 --> 00:04:43.480
9:30 to 11:00 in the morning or
the evening?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.658
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Excellent question,

00:04:44.658 --> 00:04:49.560
thank you so much.
Morning, I'm afraid, sorry.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.030
Yeah, I'm not as young as I
used to be.

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:59.526
Let me say, if you do want to
meet at some ghastly hour of the

00:04:59.526 --> 00:05:01.629
evening or something,
send me email.

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.674
We can find a time,
same with the teaching

00:05:04.674 --> 00:05:07.085
assistants.
Send stuff into the classes

00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:09.816
server at all times,
we just don't guarantee to look

00:05:09.816 --> 00:05:12.279
at it after 8:00 the night
before it's due.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:15.662
Start the problem sets early,
that way if you have a question

00:05:15.662 --> 00:05:17.784
you can answer it.
Not only that,

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:21.761
if you even just look at the
problem set, your brain will

00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:26.235
work on it in your subconscious
and you won't freak out quite so

00:05:26.235 --> 00:05:30.709
much when you get past midnight
the night before it's due.

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:34.471
Let's see, in general,
I'm going to try and make it so

00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:38.871
that everything you need to know
to do a particular problem set

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:43.200
has been covered in class by the
day the problem set is handed

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.759
out.
That would be today for this

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.294
one.
In the very first week this

00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:50.149
week I'm not quite going to make
it and so there's one problem,

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:53.165
it's noted on the problem set,
there's one problem that you'll

00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:55.389
need stuff that I'll talk about
on Tuesday.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.540
There are going to be a bunch
of help sheets for various

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.370
topics that are going to also be
linked to the classes server.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.478
By all means,
take a look at the problem set

00:06:07.478 --> 00:06:11.020
and start thinking about it as
soon as you can.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.220
Okay.

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:21.129
Let me remind you what we had
started to talk about.

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:26.269
The class is organized into
three fairly specific topics.

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:28.959
The first of which is
extrasolar planets.

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:31.230
Planets around stars other than
the Sun.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.709
Exoplanets, so-called.
That's our topic.

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:38.768
One of the things that I
pointed out last time is that,

00:06:38.768 --> 00:06:41.600
surprisingly enough,
very--until ten years ago none

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.554
of these were known.
And it's only a very recent

00:06:44.554 --> 00:06:47.744
development that there's any
actual evidence that these

00:06:47.744 --> 00:06:50.435
things exist.
So, one question you might ask

00:06:50.435 --> 00:06:52.819
is why are these things so hard
to find?

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.360
The science fiction folks seem
to have no trouble;

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.101
they just sort of go around in
their spaceships and find these

00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:01.897
things all over the place.
And to consider that question

00:07:01.897 --> 00:07:07.800
let me show you a picture.
Here's a picture of a star.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.370
This is the star Sirius.
It's the brightest.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.197
It's a blowup obviously of a
photograph plus a little

00:07:13.197 --> 00:07:14.778
Photoshopped [computer program
to edit photos]

00:07:14.778 --> 00:07:16.778
arrow.
That's not a celestial object

00:07:16.778 --> 00:07:17.460
[laughter].

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.209
So, this is a blowup of a
photograph of the star Sirius.

00:07:24.209 --> 00:07:27.959
Sirius is the brightest star in
the sky to the--easily visible

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:30.500
with the naked eye.
In fact, as I say,

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.430
the brightest star.
It's one of the closest stars.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.930
It's a little bit brighter than
the Sun intrinsically,

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.440
but it's ten light years away
or so.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.129
And let me comment on a couple
features of this picture.

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:44.961
First of all,
you can see the star covers a

00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:48.129
fair amount of area on this
blown up picture,

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:51.996
but that has nothing to do with
the actual size or shape of the

00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:54.752
star itself.
It's not like it's a big round

00:07:54.752 --> 00:07:58.490
ball with spikes coming off it.
That's not what's happening.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.691
In fact, if you had perfect
optics and perfect vision,

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:07.209
this star would be a point
basically so small you couldn't

00:08:07.209 --> 00:08:10.379
resolve it right in the middle
here.

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:13.980
That's the physical extent of
the star at this scale.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.490
It's something like this
[pointing to photo],

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.000
and you wouldn't be able to see
it at all.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.339
The reason it's extended is for
two reasons;

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:21.906
first of all,
the atmosphere distorts--this

00:08:21.906 --> 00:08:25.451
was a ground-based picture,
the atmosphere distorts how you

00:08:25.451 --> 00:08:27.337
see the star,
and in particular,

00:08:27.337 --> 00:08:30.019
it's like looking up from the
bottom of a swimming pool.

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:33.062
There's distortion in the
atmosphere and it makes the

00:08:33.062 --> 00:08:36.078
stars seem to jump around.
And so if you take a long

00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:38.890
photographic exposure of
something the star has been

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.923
jumping around during the
exposure and it smears out the

00:08:41.923 --> 00:08:44.547
image.
Plus also, the optics of the

00:08:44.547 --> 00:08:48.582
telescope aren't perfect,
and these spiky things here are

00:08:48.582 --> 00:08:51.320
due to the optics of the
telescope.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.860
This sort of--there are all
these spikes and that has to do

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.399
with how one of the mirrors of
the telescope is held up.

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:02.016
So, the combination of optics
and atmosphere sort of spreads

00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:06.410
out the light by a whole bunch.
This is always the case even

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.049
when you're doing observations
from space.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:15.001
Now, the little arrow here is
pointing at a little bump off in

00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:19.953
the side, but you might not have
thought anything more of than

00:09:19.953 --> 00:09:23.155
you did about these spikes.
But in fact,

00:09:23.155 --> 00:09:25.039
that's not a property of
optics;

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:26.929
there's actually something
there.

00:09:26.929 --> 00:09:30.169
That's an object in orbit
around Sirius.

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:33.530
And you might think that this
is the way you would go about

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.790
finding planets orbiting other
stars.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.020
It would look kind of like this.
Here's a great big star;

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.692
there's a planet.
And if you watch this thing

00:09:40.692 --> 00:09:43.905
over a course of many years,
you actually see the position

00:09:43.905 --> 00:09:46.710
of this point move around.
It's because it's in orbit.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.660
It's in about a forty-year
orbit.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.460
Here's the thing.
This isn't a planet.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.892
It's another star.
This is another star somewhat

00:09:55.892 --> 00:09:57.340
fainter than this [pointing to
the photo of Sirius].

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.952
A planet would be 10,000 times
fainter than this thing,

00:10:00.952 --> 00:10:04.899
but probably in about the same
relative position to this.

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:09.264
Now, picture all this light,
all this mess from this star,

00:10:09.264 --> 00:10:14.088
and try to find something right
here that's 10,000 times fainter

00:10:14.088 --> 00:10:16.830
than this.
That's the problem.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:21.759
The problem is that planets are
relatively faint things.

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:24.190
That, in itself isn't
catastrophic.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.009
We have big telescopes;
we can see pretty faint things.

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:30.561
It's just they are faint things
that are really near to things

00:10:30.561 --> 00:10:32.691
that are bright,
and so basically,

00:10:32.691 --> 00:10:36.062
the problem with finding
planets around other stars is

00:10:36.062 --> 00:10:40.259
the same as trying to find stars
in the sky during the daytime.

00:10:40.259 --> 00:10:42.600
Why can't you see the stars
during the daytime?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.955
Because the background of the
sky is much, much brighter than

00:10:45.955 --> 00:10:48.785
the stars are.
Similarly, if you had a little

00:10:48.785 --> 00:10:52.526
planet here you wouldn't be able
to distinguish it from the

00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:56.396
atmospheric distortions and the
optical distortions caused by

00:10:56.396 --> 00:10:59.169
the telescope that takes this
picture.

00:10:59.169 --> 00:11:02.679
So, the problem is you've got
stuff that's faint near things

00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:05.547
that are bright,
and the bright things have all

00:11:05.547 --> 00:11:09.023
kinds of distortions on them
anyway, and so you wouldn't be

00:11:09.023 --> 00:11:11.899
able to figure out what actually
is a planet.

00:11:11.899 --> 00:11:16.403
So, just to summarize this,
the problem is not that the

00:11:16.403 --> 00:11:20.990
planets are too faint,
although they are quite faint.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:27.150
The problem is that the planets
are too close to the star.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.900
That prompts--we've got to
quantify this statement I think

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.160
and so the question arises,
"Well how close is it?"

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.981
That leads into a discussion,
which we already started last

00:11:45.981 --> 00:11:47.310
time, of planetary orbits.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:54.571
If you want to answer that
question in any quantitative

00:11:54.571 --> 00:11:57.864
sort of way.
You will recall that in the

00:11:57.864 --> 00:12:02.664
last class I wrote down an
important equation of--regarding

00:12:02.664 --> 00:12:06.238
planetary orbits,
that looks like this:

00:12:06.238 --> 00:12:10.807
a^(3) = P^(2)M,
where this [M]

00:12:10.807 --> 00:12:16.381
is the mass of the objects in
orbit around each other in units

00:12:16.381 --> 00:12:19.986
of solar masses.
This [P^(2)]

00:12:19.986 --> 00:12:25.750
is the orbital period in units
of years.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.012
And this [a^(3)]
is--orbits you will recall are

00:12:30.012 --> 00:12:35.294
ellipses, and this is the
so-called semi-major axis of the

00:12:35.294 --> 00:12:39.649
ellipse in units called
Astronomical Units,

00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:45.580
which is the distance from the
Earth to the Sun.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.036
Or the semi-major axis of the
Earth-Sun orbit,

00:12:48.036 --> 00:12:48.910
more properly.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.130
So, that's in a particular set
of units.

00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:59.482
Before going on,
let me make a couple general

00:12:59.482 --> 00:13:02.015
remarks about equations.
First thing to say about

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:04.312
equations is there's this idea
that equations,

00:13:04.312 --> 00:13:06.252
mathematics,
is some terribly different

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:11.159
language, not at all.
This is an English sentence.

00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:16.157
The sentence reads A cubed is
equal to P squared times

00:13:16.157 --> 00:13:18.908
M, period.
If you wrote this down in a

00:13:18.908 --> 00:13:21.419
textbook you'd actually see they
put the period in there.

00:13:21.419 --> 00:13:23.923
It's got a verb,
is equal to,

00:13:23.923 --> 00:13:27.590
it's got a subject,
it's got an object.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:31.379
All this is is a different way
of writing stuff down.

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:33.110
So, it's not a different
language;

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.399
it's just a different writing
system, that's all.

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:37.570
So, don't freak out,
that's the first thing.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:42.741
It's just ordinary English.
The second thing to say is that

00:13:42.741 --> 00:13:45.937
this is a physics equation and
not a math equation,

00:13:45.937 --> 00:13:48.429
and that's actually a subtler
point.

00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:51.507
You will recall back in
eighth-grade algebra when they

00:13:51.507 --> 00:13:55.049
started writing down X is equal
to whatever X was equal to.

00:13:55.049 --> 00:13:57.583
And they said,
you know, the amazingly cool

00:13:57.583 --> 00:14:00.600
thing about algebra is that X
could be anything.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.329
That's why it's so powerful,
and so you can solve whole

00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:06.058
classes of problems all at once
just by letting X equal

00:14:06.058 --> 00:14:09.950
something unknown.
That's math;

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.960
physics--it isn't true.
It is not the case that this

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.410
equation is true regardless of
what a is,

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.340
or regardless of what P
is.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.467
This is only true for very
specific meanings of those

00:14:21.467 --> 00:14:25.127
quantities.
And the amazing thing about the

00:14:25.127 --> 00:14:29.957
Universe is it turns out that
math equations apply in very

00:14:29.957 --> 00:14:34.279
specific physical situations.
This didn't have to be true.

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:37.816
Either that you could express
physical things in mathematical

00:14:37.816 --> 00:14:41.234
equations, and that math and
physics would have anything to

00:14:41.234 --> 00:14:44.361
do with each other.
And it is different to have a

00:14:44.361 --> 00:14:48.150
physics equation than to have a
math equation because it has to

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.725
be so specific.
If you substitute something

00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:53.239
that isn't the semi-major axis
in for a,

00:14:53.239 --> 00:14:55.480
then that equation isn't true
anymore.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.349
It seems kind of obvious,
I know, but worth keeping in

00:14:59.349 --> 00:15:02.011
mind.
The other thing is that physics

00:15:02.011 --> 00:15:05.549
equations tend to have units
associated with them.

00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:07.179
Not always, but most of the
time.

00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:09.655
And so that's why it's so
important to say,

00:15:09.655 --> 00:15:13.073
well, this is true not only if
M stands for mass but

00:15:13.073 --> 00:15:16.550
also if mass is expressed in a
particular set of units,

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:20.655
in this case solar masses.
You'll recall from last time

00:15:20.655 --> 00:15:24.601
that this is actually a specific
version of a slightly more

00:15:24.601 --> 00:15:28.208
general equation which looks
like this: a^(3) =

00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:33.756
P^(2)GM/4π^(2),
where G is a constant that

00:15:33.756 --> 00:15:38.139
depends on what units you're
using.

00:15:38.139 --> 00:15:41.600
And last time I derived this
equation from that.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:49.706
But another way of saying it is
if you choose your units to be

00:15:49.706 --> 00:15:55.820
solar masses,
years, and astronomical units;

00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:02.340
then G is equal to 4π^(2) and
so it cancels out.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.562
That's another way of thinking
about why this specific version

00:16:06.562 --> 00:16:10.259
of the equation works out.
All right.

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:12.849
So, once you've got your
physics equation,

00:16:12.849 --> 00:16:15.250
what are you supposed to do
with it?

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.177
Well, the first thing you
should do is take a careful look

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:21.259
at it and figure out what kinds
of problems you can solve.

00:16:21.259 --> 00:16:23.536
This, again,
is fairly straight-forward,

00:16:23.536 --> 00:16:26.644
obvious stuff.
If you've got a^(3) =

00:16:26.644 --> 00:16:29.673
P^(2)M,
there are obviously three

00:16:29.673 --> 00:16:32.470
different problems you can
solve.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.560
If you know a and
M you can compute

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.086
P, right?
If you know a and

00:16:38.086 --> 00:16:40.080
P you can compute
M.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.209
And if you know P and
M you can compute

00:16:42.209 --> 00:16:43.554
a.
So, you know two of these

00:16:43.554 --> 00:16:46.813
things, you find out the third.
This problem--an example of

00:16:46.813 --> 00:16:50.720
this problem we did last time.
We had--we solved for the

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.095
orbital period of Jupiter by
knowing how far away from the

00:16:54.095 --> 00:16:56.760
Sun it is and what the mass of
the Sun is.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:02.493
So, like Jupiter last time.
So, let's do another one of

00:17:02.493 --> 00:17:06.780
these examples just quickly
here.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.430
What is the mass of the Sun?

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.244
So, that's obviously this
version of the problem [if you

00:17:14.244 --> 00:17:16.829
know a and M you
can compute P].

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.923
And so, what we're going to do
is we're going to take a

00:17:19.923 --> 00:17:21.849
and P from the Earth's
orbit.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:25.980
Use Earth's orbit to determine
the mass of the Sun.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.047
And this is,
in fact, how one goes about

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:32.092
determining the mass of the Sun.
So, let's use this in the units

00:17:32.092 --> 00:17:36.069
we have, a = 1
Astronomical Unit for the Earth.

00:17:36.069 --> 00:17:39.150
P is equal to 1 year for
the Sun.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:46.210
1^(3) = 1^(2) x M.
So, M = 1 in units of

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.267
solar masses.
That's not especially

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:50.460
surprising, right?

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.460
Not particularly illuminating,
right?

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:02.522
That the mass of the Sun comes
out to be one in units of solar

00:18:02.522 --> 00:18:04.855
masses.
If we use a different set of

00:18:04.855 --> 00:18:07.460
units this is a more interesting
calculation.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.459
So, let's use a more standard
set of units,

00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:18.053
this so called mks
units, this is meters,

00:18:18.053 --> 00:18:23.410
kilograms for mass,
and seconds for time.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:28.336
All right, so now,
turns out an Astronomical Unit

00:18:28.336 --> 00:18:32.852
is expressed in meters is 150
billion meters,

00:18:32.852 --> 00:18:36.981
approximately.
It looks something like this

00:18:36.981 --> 00:18:40.529
[150,000,000,000].
And what's a year expressed in

00:18:40.529 --> 00:18:43.803
seconds?
Well, let's see a year is

00:18:43.803 --> 00:18:49.471
365.24 days, a day is 24 hours,
an hour is 60 minutes,

00:18:49.471 --> 00:18:55.459
and a minute is 60 seconds,
so that's a year expressed in

00:18:55.459 --> 00:18:59.264
seconds.
And at this point we better

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:03.019
pause and get our large numbers
straight.

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:06.883
You are all probably familiar I
imagine with scientific

00:19:06.883 --> 00:19:09.151
notation.
This becomes very important,

00:19:09.151 --> 00:19:11.532
otherwise the numbers,
as you can clearly see,

00:19:11.532 --> 00:19:15.776
get completely out of hand.
And because it's so important

00:19:15.776 --> 00:19:21.640
I'm going to tire you by writing
down some facts about scientific

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.556
notation.
There's a help sheet on this if

00:19:24.556 --> 00:19:27.369
you have any trouble but recall
how this works.

00:19:27.369 --> 00:19:31.936
You're supposed to express
numbers as in the following

00:19:31.936 --> 00:19:34.435
form: N times 10^(m),
this [N]

00:19:34.435 --> 00:19:39.259
is a decimal with one digit out
in front of the dot.

00:19:39.259 --> 00:19:41.759
This [m]
is supposed to be an integer,

00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:44.799
a whole number either positive
or negative.

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:50.342
And the reason that this is
easy to deal with is because of

00:19:50.342 --> 00:19:55.119
one of the great limitations of
the human brain.

00:19:55.119 --> 00:19:58.188
We only deal well with really
small numbers,

00:19:58.188 --> 00:20:02.078
basically one-digit numbers.
If I take a few coins here and

00:20:02.078 --> 00:20:05.457
I sort of throw them up you
immediately know that there are

00:20:05.457 --> 00:20:07.963
four of them,
you don't have to count one,

00:20:07.963 --> 00:20:11.052
two, three, four to satisfy
yourself that there are four

00:20:11.052 --> 00:20:14.480
coins on this table because we
have a concept of fourness,

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.141
all of us in our minds,
and it's clear that this

00:20:17.141 --> 00:20:20.903
pattern satisfies that concept.
If I threw two coins or six

00:20:20.903 --> 00:20:24.200
coins, or seven coins you'll
probably be okay.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.448
If I threw thirteen,
you'd start to have real

00:20:26.448 --> 00:20:28.596
trouble.
If there were 271 of them,

00:20:28.596 --> 00:20:32.498
there's no way you could guess
just by looking at them how many

00:20:32.498 --> 00:20:34.800
there were.
You'd have to count them one by

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.962
one.
So, the human brain really only

00:20:36.962 --> 00:20:40.329
deals well with one-digit
numbers and you can tell this

00:20:40.329 --> 00:20:43.009
because of the names we give to
numbers.

00:20:43.009 --> 00:20:46.865
When you start getting big
numbers we call them millions or

00:20:46.865 --> 00:20:50.190
billions, or trillions and they
all sound alike,

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.441
that's because we can't tell
the difference between a million

00:20:52.441 --> 00:20:54.859
and a trillion,
it's just big.

00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:58.879
So, anytime you get up into big
numbers we start to completely

00:20:58.879 --> 00:21:01.514
lose our grip on what these
numbers mean,

00:21:01.514 --> 00:21:04.480
and you have to have elaborate
metaphors;

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.829
a trillion is a million
millions.

00:21:07.829 --> 00:21:10.661
And if you fill up the Moon
with ping-pong balls there

00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:13.164
are--I don't know.
You have to do that kind of

00:21:13.164 --> 00:21:15.130
mental exercise to get a grip on
it.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.711
The nice thing about scientific
notation is that it turns big

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:22.460
numbers into small numbers,
right?

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.951
N is a number between one and
nine, m is an integer,

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:30.058
it's one of those numbers four,
five, six that we can get our

00:21:30.058 --> 00:21:34.915
minds wrapped around.
Recall what this means,

00:21:34.915 --> 00:21:40.660
right, 10^(m) is 1 with m zeros
after it.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.086
So, that's the point of
scientific notation,

00:21:43.086 --> 00:21:46.359
it's to take big numbers and
allow us to deal with them.

00:21:46.359 --> 00:21:49.047
I think this is a really
valuable thing and I kind of

00:21:49.047 --> 00:21:52.304
wish that budget discussions in
the political context would take

00:21:52.304 --> 00:21:55.405
place in scientific notation
because people are always making

00:21:55.405 --> 00:21:58.609
mischief from the fact that all
big numbers sound alike.

00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:01.487
You have congress critters
saying things like,

00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:05.325
"oh terrible disaster," there's
a million dollars of waste in

00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:08.535
the Pentagon budget.
The Pentagon budget is $500

00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:11.102
billion dollars.
One million dollars of

00:22:11.102 --> 00:22:14.952
waste--that's me dropping a
nickel behind the couch on my

00:22:14.952 --> 00:22:17.811
budget.
So that's--nobody would accuse

00:22:17.811 --> 00:22:22.008
me of being wastefulness if I
didn't move the couch and get

00:22:22.008 --> 00:22:24.180
that nickel out,
all right.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:28.880
It's because a million sounds
big, and so does 500 billion.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.981
We have no real sense of how
big these things are relative to

00:22:32.981 --> 00:22:35.867
each other.
But we do have a sense of the

00:22:35.867 --> 00:22:39.586
difference between 6 and 11,
which is the difference in

00:22:39.586 --> 00:22:43.924
scientific notation between one
million dollars and $100 billion

00:22:43.924 --> 00:22:46.810
dollars,
so that's how this works.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.865
So, arithmetic rules.
Again, there's a help sheet on

00:22:50.865 --> 00:22:54.688
this if you're rusty.
If you have N times 10^(m) and

00:22:54.688 --> 00:22:59.470
you multiply it by another
scientific notation number,

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.958
A times 10^(B),
that is equal to A times N

00:23:02.958 --> 00:23:07.441
(times 10 to the n+m).
And the other nice thing about

00:23:07.441 --> 00:23:12.242
scientific notation is it turns
multiplication into addition

00:23:12.242 --> 00:23:16.880
because the exponents add:
A times N to--times 10^(m) plus

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.127
B.
Similarly, if you take N times

00:23:21.127 --> 00:23:28.361
10^(m) and raise it to the K,
that's N^(k) times 10 to the m

00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:31.972
times K,
so it turns exponentiation into

00:23:31.972 --> 00:23:34.649
multiplication.
So, the nice thing about

00:23:34.649 --> 00:23:38.360
dealing with exponents is it
makes it one kind of arithmetic

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.082
easier.
So, a specific example of this

00:23:41.082 --> 00:23:44.779
might be N times 10^(m),
the square root of that which

00:23:44.779 --> 00:23:47.569
is raising something to the ½
power.

00:23:47.569 --> 00:23:54.119
This is equal to N^(1/2) times
10^(m/2).

00:23:54.119 --> 00:23:57.512
That works if m is an
even number but if m is

00:23:57.512 --> 00:23:59.910
an odd number you get a crazy
exponent.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.440
This really has to be an
integer over here.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.906
So, what do you do then?
You say N times 10^(m) to the

00:24:07.906 --> 00:24:15.920
½ is equal to 10 times N times
N^(m-1) to the ½ power.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.818
So, I've just moved a 10 from
here over to here,

00:24:20.818 --> 00:24:27.279
and then that is equal to 10 N
to the ½ times 10^((m-1)/2).

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:30.783
And that's how you recover when
you take a square root or

00:24:30.783 --> 00:24:33.867
something like that.
That's how you recover an

00:24:33.867 --> 00:24:36.660
integer on this side.
We'll have lots of practice in

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:42.059
this kind of thing.
So, going back to the problem.

00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:47.430
1 AU is equal to 1.5 times
10^(11) meters;

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:53.160
1 year is equal to 2.4 times
10^(1).

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:59.701
That's 24 times 6 times 10^(1)
times, 6 times 10^(1),

00:24:59.701 --> 00:25:04.230
times 3.6524 times 10^(2)
seconds.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:09.421
All right, so let's do that
one, two, three,

00:25:09.421 --> 00:25:16.785
four, five--2.4 times 6 times,
6 times 3.6 times 10^(5) to the

00:25:16.785 --> 00:25:20.223
5;
2.5 times 6 is around 15,15

00:25:20.223 --> 00:25:25.649
times 6 is around 90,90 is a
little less than 100,3.6 a

00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:30.533
little more than 6.
Those two things multiplied

00:25:30.533 --> 00:25:36.323
together is around 300.
And 300 times 10^(5) is equal

00:25:36.323 --> 00:25:40.857
to 3 times 10^(7).
So, there are around 3 times

00:25:40.857 --> 00:25:45.694
10^(7) seconds in 1 year.
That's a good number to

00:25:45.694 --> 00:25:49.510
remember.
In mks units,

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:56.375
G is this magical constant,
is something like 7 times

00:25:56.375 --> 00:25:59.369
10^(-11).
That's an approximation.

00:25:59.369 --> 00:26:02.233
It's actually 6.6 something,
something, something times

00:26:02.233 --> 00:26:06.068
10^(-11), but we'll call it 7.
So, now we're in a position to

00:26:06.068 --> 00:26:09.420
calculate what the solar mass is
in kilograms.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:15.512
So remember a^(3) equal
to GMP squared over

00:26:15.512 --> 00:26:18.509
4π^(2).
So, let's see,

00:26:18.509 --> 00:26:23.887
1.5 times 10^(11);
that's an astronomical unit

00:26:23.887 --> 00:26:25.774
cubed.
P squared,

00:26:25.774 --> 00:26:28.880
3 times 10^(7);
that's 1 year squared;

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.680
7 times 10^(-11) that's
G over M over

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.677
4π^(2).
I'm going to do the arithmetic

00:26:36.677 --> 00:26:39.161
really fast.
I would like you to learn how

00:26:39.161 --> 00:26:42.531
to do this yourself rather than
relying on calculators so this

00:26:42.531 --> 00:26:45.366
is an example.
Let me blaze through this at

00:26:45.366 --> 00:26:47.611
warp speed;
then we'll stop and consider

00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:49.299
what's happened.
All right.

00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:56.866
On the right-hand side,
3^(2) is--that's 3^(2) times

00:26:56.866 --> 00:27:03.839
10^(7) times 2 is 14,
times 7 times 10^(-11).

00:27:03.839 --> 00:27:09.460
M over 4 times π,
times π.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:15.230
3^(2) is 10.
10 times 10^(14) is 10^(15).

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:20.139
And so on the top we've got
10^(15) times 7,

00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:24.154
times 10^(-11).
15 minus 11 is 4 so that's 7

00:27:24.154 --> 00:27:28.019
times 10^(4) on top.
π times π is 10 that's 40.

00:27:28.019 --> 00:27:32.270
4 times 10 to the 1 on the
bottom, 7 divided by 4 is 2,

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.339
and so that's 2 times 10^(3)
times m.

00:27:35.339 --> 00:27:41.131
Good, left-hand side,
all right 1.5 times,

00:27:41.131 --> 00:27:47.346
1.5 times, 1.5,
that's 1.5^(3) times 10^(33),

00:27:47.346 --> 00:27:50.400
why 33?
That's 11 times 3.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.400
1.5 times 1.5 that's a little
bit more than 2.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.619
If you multiply something
that's a little bit more than 2

00:27:56.619 --> 00:27:58.840
by something that's a little bit
less than 2 that's 4,

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:04.829
and so this is 4 times 10^(33).
Now we want m, right?

00:28:04.829 --> 00:28:07.279
So we've got to divide both
sides by 2 times 10^(3);

00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:14.220
m is equal to 4 halves times
10^(33) over 10^(3).

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.891
That's 10^(-33) minus 3.
That's 2 times 10^(30)

00:28:18.891 --> 00:28:22.690
kilograms, got to put the units
in.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:27.550
Okay, how we doing?
Questions, comments, abuse.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.078
Yes sir?
Student: How accurate is

00:28:29.078 --> 00:28:29.875
that number?
Professor Charles

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:30.789
Bailyn: How accurate is that
number?

00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:34.335
It's accurate to about one
digit, which is why I only wrote

00:28:34.335 --> 00:28:36.720
down one digit of accuracy out
front.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.319
This is a pro--excellent
question thank you very much.

00:28:39.319 --> 00:28:44.093
This is appropriate because
remember I'm using 7 times 10

00:28:44.093 --> 00:28:48.269
minus 11 for G,
where it's actually 6.6.

00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:51.730
So, I'm already about 10% off
from there.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.633
I did my little calculation to
come up with one year equals 3

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:59.185
times 10^(7) seconds.
That's about accurate to one

00:28:59.185 --> 00:29:01.883
digit or so.
And so the whole thing is done

00:29:01.883 --> 00:29:04.928
to one digit accuracy.
If you're dealing with one

00:29:04.928 --> 00:29:07.884
digit accuracy,
it is true that 7 divided by 4

00:29:07.884 --> 00:29:09.549
is 2.
It really is true,

00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:13.029
because if that wasn't true,
then you would have to have

00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:17.079
more digits on your unit for
G or something like that.

00:29:17.079 --> 00:29:21.007
In particular,
let me make an official rule

00:29:21.007 --> 00:29:24.284
for this course.
Three equals π,

00:29:24.284 --> 00:29:28.369
equals the square root of 10,
all right.

00:29:28.369 --> 00:29:31.981
That will solve an enormous
amount of arithmetic problems

00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:35.269
and it will not get you into any
serious trouble.

00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:39.049
So, we don't have to worry
about the .14159 and however

00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:42.059
many more digits you all
memorized it to.

00:29:42.059 --> 00:29:45.670
And when you multiply it
together you get ten.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.031
Yes?
Student: Are you

00:29:47.031 --> 00:29:48.880
expecting this kind of
calculation for problem sets?

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.609
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yes.

00:29:50.609 --> 00:29:52.170
The question was,
"Am I expecting this kind of

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.359
calculation for problem sets?"
The answer is "yes."

00:29:54.359 --> 00:29:56.460
Here's the rule about
calculators.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.051
Let me put it this way:
You can only use calculators if

00:30:00.051 --> 00:30:02.380
I can't tell that you've done
it.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.520
So, that means you can check
your work to make sure you've it

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.187
right or something.
But if you start coming up with

00:30:10.187 --> 00:30:14.050
numbers like 7.1516397,
that's eight digits of accuracy

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:18.200
and I'm pretty sure you haven't
worked it out yourself.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:24.085
So important,
no calculators on the tests,

00:30:24.085 --> 00:30:27.008
okay?
So, get some practice doing

00:30:27.008 --> 00:30:30.396
this kind of thing.
And this will--this I promise

00:30:30.396 --> 00:30:34.262
you will be useful to you in
everyday life because this is

00:30:34.262 --> 00:30:38.128
how you catch the politicians
doing screwy things with big

00:30:38.128 --> 00:30:40.757
numbers.
You do it in your head in

00:30:40.757 --> 00:30:44.882
scientific notation and you
figure out whether the answer is

00:30:44.882 --> 00:30:47.933
meaningful or not.
This whole business of

00:30:47.933 --> 00:30:51.460
significant digits,
I think, is badly distorted;

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.380
by the way, it's taught in high
school.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.711
In high school you,
and also I should say in

00:30:55.711 --> 00:30:58.529
laboratory courses sometimes at
the college level,

00:30:58.529 --> 00:31:02.223
you often get situations where
people say--give you a whole

00:31:02.223 --> 00:31:06.172
sheet of rules on how to figure
out how many significant digits

00:31:06.172 --> 00:31:08.200
you have.
This is nonsense.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.730
All you have to do is behave
like a human being.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.363
We say to each other,
I'll meet you in the dining

00:31:13.363 --> 00:31:16.042
hall in ten minutes.
That doesn't mean--that means

00:31:16.042 --> 00:31:19.038
something different from I'll
meet you in the dining hall in

00:31:19.038 --> 00:31:21.119
eleven minutes and twenty-six
seconds.

00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:24.359
Even if the person happens to
show up in the dining hall in

00:31:24.359 --> 00:31:27.039
exactly eleven minutes and
twenty-six seconds.

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:29.107
Ten minutes means I'll meet you
there in ten minutes,

00:31:29.107 --> 00:31:31.745
we all know what that means.
I'll meet you there in eleven

00:31:31.745 --> 00:31:34.687
minutes and twenty-six seconds
means you're a character in a

00:31:34.687 --> 00:31:37.230
bad spy novel who's just
synchronized his watch.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:41.130
So, this shows up in science
fiction too.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.191
I don't know how many of you
are Star Trek fans,

00:31:43.191 --> 00:31:46.132
I certainly am [laughter].
And in all the different Star

00:31:46.132 --> 00:31:48.730
Trek movies [inaudible
comment]--thank you.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.887
In all the different--a friend
[referring to person who made

00:31:50.887 --> 00:31:52.824
comment].
In all the different Star Trek

00:31:52.824 --> 00:31:55.791
movies there's always a second
in command who isn't a human

00:31:55.791 --> 00:31:58.936
being, right?
A Vulcan or an android or some

00:31:58.936 --> 00:32:02.027
damn thing or another.
And to emphasize the

00:32:02.027 --> 00:32:05.557
non-humanness of these
characters, what they do is they

00:32:05.557 --> 00:32:08.500
make them use too many
significant digits.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.099
And so that makes them inhuman
and so the captain will say,

00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:14.829
"When are we landing on omicron
M?"

00:32:14.829 --> 00:32:18.211
The second in command will say,
"Well, we should assume

00:32:18.211 --> 00:32:21.530
standard orbit in 2.6395
minutes," emphasizing somehow

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.910
superior brain power or
something.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:28.564
But it's nonsense because it
takes the guy ten seconds to say

00:32:28.564 --> 00:32:32.055
that sentence,
so what is this time calculated

00:32:32.055 --> 00:32:35.577
to a 100th of a second?
Does it start from when he

00:32:35.577 --> 00:32:38.779
begins the sentence?
From when he ends the sentence?

00:32:38.779 --> 00:32:41.680
What's the other end of that
time interval?

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:47.190
Can you say you assume standard
orbit to the 100th of a second?

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:50.570
What does that even mean?
When you start beaming down?

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.889
When you end beaming down?
Also, keep in mind it takes

00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:57.516
more than a 100th of second for
the sound to travel from his

00:32:57.516 --> 00:33:01.223
lips to the captain's ears,
so the whole thing is just

00:33:01.223 --> 00:33:03.884
nonsense.
And so, you don't need any

00:33:03.884 --> 00:33:07.400
special rules,
just behave like a human being;

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:13.000
don't behave like an android.
So, no androids.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.319
And that's the only rule I'm
going to give you [laughter].

00:33:15.319 --> 00:33:19.421
These two are the only rules
I'm going to give you about

00:33:19.421 --> 00:33:22.628
significant digits,
just do the right thing,

00:33:22.628 --> 00:33:25.652
okay.
All right, okay so this is all

00:33:25.652 --> 00:33:30.356
lovely but we haven't actually
started to answer the question

00:33:30.356 --> 00:33:34.005
we started the class with.
Let me remind you where we

00:33:34.005 --> 00:33:35.910
began this disquisition on
numbers.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:41.650
The question was supposed to be
how far away from stars are

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.839
planets?
So, we haven't answered the

00:33:45.839 --> 00:33:52.594
question, when the question was,
"How close are planets to

00:33:52.594 --> 00:33:55.100
stars?"
This notation will confuse the

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.950
people who didn't make it to
class today;

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:58.200
that's probably just as well
too.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.380
All right, how close to
planets--are planets to stars?

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:06.048
Now, we have a problem because
closeness--we usually think of

00:34:06.048 --> 00:34:09.159
this as being measured with
distances.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:13.130
And distances are a serious
problem in astronomy.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.933
Supposing you--Distance,
by the way, is more or less the

00:34:15.933 --> 00:34:17.360
same thing as size,
right?

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.202
Size is the distance from one
side of something to another

00:34:20.202 --> 00:34:23.586
side of something.
So, size and distance are the

00:34:23.586 --> 00:34:25.312
same.
So, supposing you ask the

00:34:25.312 --> 00:34:28.840
question, "How big is the Moon?"
What is the size of the Moon?

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.389
What is the distance from one
side of the Moon to the other?

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:34.319
You go out one night and you
look up at the Moon and you do

00:34:34.319 --> 00:34:37.400
this [holding fingers apart],
one on each side of the Moon.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.639
You say, well,
it's about an inch and a half.

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:41.581
Now, obviously that's
meaningless, because if you had

00:34:41.581 --> 00:34:44.070
done it here,
it would have been about a half

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.016
inch.
And we all know that

00:34:46.016 --> 00:34:49.250
isn't--that somehow is not the
right answer.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:52.558
If you look at the screen over
here, for example,

00:34:52.558 --> 00:34:56.005
and you hold out your hands
about eight inches from

00:34:56.005 --> 00:34:59.135
your--close one eye,
hold out--you can try this,

00:34:59.135 --> 00:35:01.976
hold out your hands about here,
you'll find that that

00:35:01.976 --> 00:35:04.981
screen--the lit part of the
screen is about four or five

00:35:04.981 --> 00:35:07.743
inches across.
But if you go closer to your

00:35:07.743 --> 00:35:10.019
eye, it's only about an inch
across.

00:35:10.019 --> 00:35:13.074
If you're at arm's length it's
maybe six, eight inches where

00:35:13.074 --> 00:35:15.443
I'm standing here.
And if you try it at the back

00:35:15.443 --> 00:35:17.376
of the class,
you'll get a different answer

00:35:17.376 --> 00:35:21.123
from what I just got.
So, distance is a problematical

00:35:21.123 --> 00:35:23.234
thing.
And so--But on the other hand,

00:35:23.234 --> 00:35:26.112
obviously, the size of the
screen hasn't changed depending

00:35:26.112 --> 00:35:29.292
on where my arms were or whether
I'm standing at the back of the

00:35:29.292 --> 00:35:32.310
room or the front of the room.
So, something has to be

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:34.540
measurable there,
but it isn't distance.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.728
What it is, is angle.
What you can measure in

00:35:38.728 --> 00:35:42.013
astronomy are angles.
So, here's what you really want

00:35:42.013 --> 00:35:43.380
to know.
Here's a star;

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.088
here's a planet going around
the star, and here is you [draws

00:35:47.088 --> 00:35:49.760
diagram on overhead].
This is the international

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.621
symbol for an observer;
it's supposed to be a little

00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:56.048
stylized eyeball.
So, this observer is looking at

00:35:56.048 --> 00:36:00.948
this star-planet system.
And looks at the star and looks

00:36:00.948 --> 00:36:04.446
at the planet.
And what you can measure is the

00:36:04.446 --> 00:36:07.550
angle, which I'm going to call
α here.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.922
And if you simulate the angle
by putting your hands up close

00:36:10.922 --> 00:36:13.380
to your eye, you'll get a small
distance;

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.219
if you do it further away
you'll get a bigger distance.

00:36:16.219 --> 00:36:18.710
But what you are measuring is
the angle.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:22.913
What you would like is a way of
being able to convert from that

00:36:22.913 --> 00:36:26.539
angle into a distance.
And now, the ugly specter of

00:36:26.539 --> 00:36:29.955
trigonometry rears its head.
Because that's what

00:36:29.955 --> 00:36:32.602
trigonometry is.
It's a way of turning angles

00:36:32.602 --> 00:36:35.257
into distances and vice versa.
And you may remember

00:36:35.257 --> 00:36:37.530
constructions that look vaguely
like this;

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.145
let's put some labels on it.
Here's distance 1,

00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:43.260
here's distance 2,
here's distance 3.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:47.381
And this is the definition of
sine, the sine of α is

00:36:47.381 --> 00:36:50.945
equal to the opposite over the
hypotenuse, so that's

00:36:50.945 --> 00:36:53.530
D_2 over
D_3.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.699
And now--so that's how you do
it.

00:36:55.699 --> 00:36:59.033
Now, I promised you on Tuesday
that the sine was going to

00:36:59.033 --> 00:37:01.730
cancel out, and so it is.
Here's how.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:06.325
If you use small angles it
turns out that the sine of

00:37:06.325 --> 00:37:10.977
α is equal to α,
if α is expressed in

00:37:10.977 --> 00:37:14.389
radians, which is a particular
kind of measure of angles.

00:37:14.389 --> 00:37:17.011
And so for small angles,
first of all,

00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:21.332
the hypotenuse and the longer
side are the same length more or

00:37:21.332 --> 00:37:24.272
less.
So, you've got a situation like

00:37:24.272 --> 00:37:28.284
this where D_2 over
D_1 is equal to

00:37:28.284 --> 00:37:31.878
α.
That is--let's circle that one

00:37:31.878 --> 00:37:33.519
in red;
it's going to be important.

00:37:33.519 --> 00:37:38.849
That's called the small angle
formula.

00:37:38.849 --> 00:37:41.599
And once again,
you have to be careful of the

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:42.922
units.
And once again,

00:37:42.922 --> 00:37:45.991
there's two sets of units in
which you might possibly use

00:37:45.991 --> 00:37:48.085
this.
So D_2 over

00:37:48.085 --> 00:37:52.740
D_1 is equal to α.
If D_2 and

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:58.810
D_1 are in the same
units, then α has to be

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:02.296
radians.
A radian--there are 2π radians

00:38:02.296 --> 00:38:03.230
in a circle.

00:38:08.389 --> 00:38:11.900
You'll recall there are 360
degrees in a circle that's how

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.179
you convert from degrees to
radian.

00:38:14.179 --> 00:38:15.820
But there's a better set of
units.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.934
It turns out also that if you
do this, use this equation

00:38:18.934 --> 00:38:22.183
D_2,/D_1,
α, and D_2 is

00:38:22.183 --> 00:38:25.170
measured in Astronomical Units,
remember those?

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:29.024
That's the Earth-Sun distance.
And D_1 is measured

00:38:29.024 --> 00:38:33.260
in parsecs, which is equal to 3
times 10^(16) meters;

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.630
that's about three light years,
for those of you counting at

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:42.760
home.
And α is in arc seconds.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:46.734
Then it also works out.
Let me tell--an arc second,

00:38:46.734 --> 00:38:51.750
let's see, 60 arc seconds is
equal to an arc minute.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.190
Just so you know how these
units work;

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:57.600
60 arc minutes is equal to 1
degree.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.676
So, that's a really small angle.
So, it turns out this set of

00:39:01.676 --> 00:39:04.736
units is particularly useful for
these kinds of planet

00:39:04.736 --> 00:39:07.696
calculations,
because distances from planets

00:39:07.696 --> 00:39:10.820
to stars tend to be a few
astronomical units.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.030
Distances from us to the
nearest star.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.014
The nearest star,
aside from the Sun,

00:39:15.014 --> 00:39:17.110
turns out to be about 1 parsec
away.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:20.329
So, distances to stars are some
number of parsecs.

00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:23.967
And so, you'll get answers that
are a few arc seconds,

00:39:23.967 --> 00:39:28.086
and this is yet another way of
turning big numbers into small

00:39:28.086 --> 00:39:30.283
numbers.
You've used the right set of

00:39:30.283 --> 00:39:32.539
units so that everything's
approximately one.

00:39:32.539 --> 00:39:36.889
Another way of compensating for
the weakness of the human brain.

00:39:36.889 --> 00:39:42.920
Okay, so now we can solve a
problem.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:47.559
We can actually solve
numerically the question of how

00:39:47.559 --> 00:39:50.860
far away from a star is our
planet?

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.739
So, here's an example.
Here's a problem of the kinds

00:39:54.739 --> 00:39:57.100
that might show up on a problem
set.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.988
I told you that that object
orbiting Sirius has about a

00:40:03.988 --> 00:40:08.757
forty-year period.
So, let's take a planet with a

00:40:08.757 --> 00:40:12.698
forty-year period;
that's kind of between Saturn

00:40:12.698 --> 00:40:14.770
and Uranus in our own Solar
System.

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:23.055
Around a star 3 parsecs away;
pc means parsecs,

00:40:23.055 --> 00:40:27.500
whatever they may tell you in
the humanities classes.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:34.530
Around a star 3 parsecs away,
what is the angular separation?

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:38.741
Angular separation,
because that's what we can

00:40:38.741 --> 00:40:41.950
actually measure.
We can't measure the distance

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:46.257
but we can measure the angle.
Okay, so this is a hard

00:40:46.257 --> 00:40:50.867
problem, why is it hard?
It's hard for two different

00:40:50.867 --> 00:40:52.031
reasons.
First of all,

00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:54.690
well, you guys know how to
solve problems like this.

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:57.214
You all went to high school.
What you do is you say,

00:40:57.214 --> 00:41:00.084
okay what do I know?
I have P = 40,

00:41:00.084 --> 00:41:03.474
I have D = 3,
I want α, so I look for an

00:41:03.474 --> 00:41:07.152
equation with D,
P, D and α in

00:41:07.152 --> 00:41:09.327
it.
I shove these two things

00:41:09.327 --> 00:41:12.922
into--you substitute them in for
P and D,

00:41:12.922 --> 00:41:16.433
and then I calculate α.
And you don't have to actually

00:41:16.433 --> 00:41:19.289
know anything about anything in
order to do that;

00:41:19.289 --> 00:41:21.019
you just have to have a good
set of notes.

00:41:21.019 --> 00:41:23.959
And you go through all the
different equations until you

00:41:23.959 --> 00:41:27.219
find the equation that contains
all the variables you have,

00:41:27.219 --> 00:41:29.519
and the one that you're asked
for.

00:41:29.519 --> 00:41:31.149
And then you can just plug it
in, you don't have to know

00:41:31.149 --> 00:41:33.849
anything about anything.
This won't work, right?

00:41:33.849 --> 00:41:37.277
Because if you go through the
lecture notes thus far,

00:41:37.277 --> 00:41:41.166
you will not find an equation
with P and D and

00:41:41.166 --> 00:41:44.660
α in it because it's two
different equations that you

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.673
have to put together.
And that requires you to

00:41:47.673 --> 00:41:50.754
actually know what you're doing.
And that of course is much

00:41:50.754 --> 00:41:55.079
harder.
So, plug and chug won't work.

00:41:55.079 --> 00:42:02.850
Chug fails because there's no
one equation.

00:42:05.969 --> 00:42:08.472
This is a hard problem for
another reason,

00:42:08.472 --> 00:42:11.829
which is that I haven't told
you something important.

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:14.743
If you try and go through and
solve this you will discover

00:42:14.743 --> 00:42:17.349
that you don't have all the
information you need,

00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:20.289
and in particular,
you need to know the total mass

00:42:20.289 --> 00:42:22.570
of the system,
the mass of the star.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:24.520
Most of the mass is in the mass
of the star.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:29.708
So, there's missing information.
That's one way to make a

00:42:29.708 --> 00:42:31.630
problem hard,
the other way to make a--if I

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.552
don't tell you everything you
need to know,

00:42:33.552 --> 00:42:37.459
it's a somewhat harder problem.
The other way to make a problem

00:42:37.459 --> 00:42:41.249
hard--this is a classic,
be warned--I will do this at

00:42:41.249 --> 00:42:43.869
some point,
is to give you one extra piece

00:42:43.869 --> 00:42:45.789
of information that you don't
need.

00:42:45.789 --> 00:42:50.373
This screws students up totally
because you go looking for the

00:42:50.373 --> 00:42:54.280
equation that uses the extra
piece of information,

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.896
and there is no such an
equation and you don't need it,

00:42:56.896 --> 00:43:00.130
then you're cast into doubt.
I must need this somehow or he

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:03.599
wouldn't have given it to me.
Nonsense.

00:43:03.599 --> 00:43:07.511
In real life it is not the case
that all problems come to you

00:43:07.511 --> 00:43:11.226
with all the information you
need and only the information

00:43:11.226 --> 00:43:13.929
that you need.
That's not how things work in

00:43:13.929 --> 00:43:16.449
real life.
And it shouldn't be how things

00:43:16.449 --> 00:43:20.005
work in preparation for real
life, which is I guess what

00:43:20.005 --> 00:43:23.704
classes sort of ought to be.
So, missing information,

00:43:23.704 --> 00:43:27.305
too much information,
sometimes although not in this

00:43:27.305 --> 00:43:29.731
case;
I could have told you the

00:43:29.731 --> 00:43:32.560
temperature of the star,
for example.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.724
I'll do that.
The temperature of Sirius is

00:43:37.724 --> 00:43:41.960
10,000 degrees,
surface temperature.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.635
So, now I've given you both;
I've left out information and

00:43:45.635 --> 00:43:49.151
told you too much.
All right, so what is the

00:43:49.151 --> 00:43:54.339
mental process that you need to
go through in solving a problem

00:43:54.339 --> 00:43:59.360
which has these kinds of
difficulties associated with it?

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:06.383
Okay.
So, how to think about such

00:44:06.383 --> 00:44:10.529
problems?
The first thing to notice is

00:44:10.529 --> 00:44:13.730
what you would do in the
ordinary plug and chug.

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:15.179
What have you got,
what do you need?

00:44:15.179 --> 00:44:17.497
You have a value for the
orbital period,

00:44:17.497 --> 00:44:20.707
you have a value for the
distance, and what you want is

00:44:20.707 --> 00:44:21.480
an angle.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:31.729
Okay.
Now, so this doesn't lead you

00:44:31.729 --> 00:44:35.972
to where you want to go.
The next thing you've got to do

00:44:35.972 --> 00:44:37.780
is make an assumption.
This is a star;

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.050
all stars are more or less the
same.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.950
So, let us imagine that this
star has a mass more or less

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:46.818
similar to that of the Sun.
So, the M is

00:44:46.818 --> 00:44:48.470
approximately equal to a solar
mass.

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:52.013
How far wrong could you go?
In fact, you go wrong by about

00:44:52.013 --> 00:44:55.107
a factor of two,
but at a certain point you're

00:44:55.107 --> 00:44:59.371
going to take the cube root of
two, and so it actually isn't so

00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:01.400
bad.
So suppose M is equal to

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.719
the mass of the Sun,
most stars are approximately.

00:45:03.719 --> 00:45:07.354
Ah ha, now we're getting
somewhere, because now we have

00:45:07.354 --> 00:45:11.006
M and P.
And if you have put that

00:45:11.006 --> 00:45:15.587
equation--Kepler's Third
Law--and interpreted it deeply

00:45:15.587 --> 00:45:18.612
into your brain,
and it has become part of your

00:45:18.612 --> 00:45:21.342
heart and soul and very being,
you will immediately realize

00:45:21.342 --> 00:45:23.320
that if you have M and
P,

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.690
of course you can calculate
a.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:29.148
In fact, you probably realized
this first before you make the

00:45:29.148 --> 00:45:31.768
assumption in step two,
because that's why you're

00:45:31.768 --> 00:45:34.313
interested in the mass,
because you realize that if you

00:45:34.313 --> 00:45:38.469
happened to have M,
you would be able to determine

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:40.765
a.
Next thing you have to do is,

00:45:40.765 --> 00:45:42.460
is interpret what this a
is;

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:45.081
a is the semi-major axis
of the orbit of the planet

00:45:45.081 --> 00:45:49.458
around the star.
That's something very close

00:45:49.458 --> 00:45:56.423
to--very similar to--the
distance between the star and

00:45:56.423 --> 00:46:01.882
the planet is a.
So, a in this equation

00:46:01.882 --> 00:46:05.404
is the same as D_2 in
the other equation,

00:46:05.404 --> 00:46:08.077
all right.
So, a is D_2

00:46:08.077 --> 00:46:11.713
and the distance you have up
there is the distance from us to

00:46:11.713 --> 00:46:14.320
that whole system,
that's D_1.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:24.180
And now, you can compute α,
right?

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:28.452
That's the thought process.
And you may have to go--sort of

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:32.851
worry a little bit around here
before you have the "ah ha"

00:46:32.851 --> 00:46:35.630
moment of how to get the
problem.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:39.980
This is the moment when you've
solved the problem.

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:45.064
The key to solving this is to
have an instinctive reaction to

00:46:45.064 --> 00:46:48.030
knowing that you've got a
period;

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:51.139
namely, if I had a mass I could
figure out the semi-major axis.

00:46:51.139 --> 00:46:53.928
Or if I had the semi-major
axis, I could figure out the

00:46:53.928 --> 00:46:55.940
mass.
And that has to click.

00:46:55.940 --> 00:47:00.214
And the way that clicks is to
have this equation really--I was

00:47:00.214 --> 00:47:04.699
joking before--but really become
instinctive in a certain way,

00:47:04.699 --> 00:47:07.190
and there won't be many
equations in this class.

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:12.264
But it will really help you to
assimilate them in that kind of

00:47:12.264 --> 00:47:14.671
depth.
All right, so now in the few

00:47:14.671 --> 00:47:17.409
minutes remaining,
let me actually solve this

00:47:17.409 --> 00:47:18.840
problem numerically.

00:47:22.429 --> 00:47:28.840
P is equal to 40 years,
D is equal to 3 parsecs.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.369
Here's something not to do:
40 times 3 times 10^(7),

00:47:32.369 --> 00:47:35.760
because that'll give you the
answer in seconds.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.582
No don't do that,
because both of the equations

00:47:38.582 --> 00:47:42.201
would rather have things in
Astronomical Units and years and

00:47:42.201 --> 00:47:45.610
things like that.
So a^(3) equals

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:49.849
P^(2)M,
M is 1 by assumption,

00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:55.026
P is 40 so this is
1,600, that's 40^(2) on this

00:47:55.026 --> 00:47:59.909
side, a^(3) that's 1.6
times 10 to the 3.

00:47:59.909 --> 00:48:04.023
Now, we're going to take the
cube root of both sides,

00:48:04.023 --> 00:48:08.769
that's the cube root of 1.6
times, the cube root of 1,000.

00:48:08.769 --> 00:48:12.369
3 times a third is equal to 1,
conveniently enough.

00:48:12.369 --> 00:48:15.357
The cube root of 1.6,
I don't know that's 1.2 or

00:48:15.357 --> 00:48:18.781
something but call it 1.
So, that's 10,

00:48:18.781 --> 00:48:23.210
and so it's 10 Astronomical
Units.

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:25.473
Remember we're doing this in
solar masses,

00:48:25.473 --> 00:48:28.299
years, Astronomical Units.
10 Astronomical Units,

00:48:28.299 --> 00:48:31.254
that's how far away it is.
Now, we can do this

00:48:31.254 --> 00:48:35.481
[D_2/D_1]
where this is in Astronomical

00:48:35.481 --> 00:48:39.999
Units, and this down here is in
parsecs, and 10 divided by 3 is

00:48:39.999 --> 00:48:43.699
3.
So, the answer is a is

00:48:43.699 --> 00:48:48.382
equal to 3 arc seconds.
Now, this is an important

00:48:48.382 --> 00:48:52.630
result because the--let me go
back to this picture.

00:48:56.409 --> 00:49:00.207
The angular scale over which
light is kind of thrown around

00:49:00.207 --> 00:49:03.482
by the atmosphere and by the
optics of the kinds of

00:49:03.482 --> 00:49:07.280
telescopes we can build is some
number of arc seconds.

00:49:10.679 --> 00:49:14.010
Good ground-based observations,
maybe half the light is inside

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:16.269
1 arc second;
the rest of the light is

00:49:16.269 --> 00:49:19.329
scattered all the way out to
maybe 10 arc seconds.

00:49:19.329 --> 00:49:21.440
From space it's a little bit
better.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:37.902
But, light from observations of
stars is scattered over angular

00:49:37.902 --> 00:49:45.331
sizes of arc seconds.
So, you are guaranteed that

00:49:45.331 --> 00:49:48.365
there's going to be a bunch of
light from the star right on top

00:49:48.365 --> 00:49:50.469
of where you're looking for your
planet.

00:49:50.469 --> 00:49:52.458
And in fact,
it's going to get worse,

00:49:52.458 --> 00:49:56.050
because one of the things about
this equation is D_1;

00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:58.699
the distance to the star.
We did this for Sirius.

00:49:58.699 --> 00:50:00.790
Sirius is one of the closest
stars;

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:05.099
it's 3 parsecs away.
Most--the center of the galaxy

00:50:05.099 --> 00:50:09.249
is 8,000 parsecs away.
So, if you take a typical star

00:50:09.249 --> 00:50:12.210
in our galaxy this number isn't
going to be 3;

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:16.386
it's going to be 8,000.
And this number isn't going to

00:50:16.386 --> 00:50:22.250
be 3, it's going to something
like 1/1000th of an arc second.

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:25.878
And the space telescope
scatters light over tenths of

00:50:25.878 --> 00:50:30.205
arc seconds, so you have factors
of 100 buried inside the light

00:50:30.205 --> 00:50:35.474
coming from that star.
So, that's why you don't care

00:50:35.474 --> 00:50:40.056
about more than one digit.
In fact, you probably don't

00:50:40.056 --> 00:50:42.890
even care about anything other
than the exponents of this

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:45.369
answer because why are you doing
this problem?

00:50:45.369 --> 00:50:48.406
You're doing this problem to
figure out whether it's

00:50:48.406 --> 00:50:51.918
plausible to think that you
might be able to see a planet as

00:50:51.918 --> 00:50:54.579
a separate dot,
separate from the star.

00:50:54.579 --> 00:50:57.771
And the fact that your answer
comes out in arc seconds or

00:50:57.771 --> 00:51:01.590
fractions of an arc second tells
you everything you need to know.

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:05.250
You don't need anymore decimal
places to realize that the idea

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:08.429
of looking up and seeing a
planet is going to fail.

00:51:08.429 --> 00:51:13.019
So, that's not the way that
we're going to find planets.

00:51:13.019 --> 00:51:16.457
So, we have to come up with
different scheme and that's what

00:51:16.457 --> 00:51:18.730
we're going to talk about on
Tuesday.

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:19.730
Thanks.

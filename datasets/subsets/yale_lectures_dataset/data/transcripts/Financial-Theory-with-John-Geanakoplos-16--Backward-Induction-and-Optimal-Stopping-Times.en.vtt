00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.369
Prof: We're now at the
stage where we're considering

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:10.442
the implications of uncertainty,
so I hope that the subtlety,

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:13.390
and surprise element of the
class,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.090
will gradually pick up without
increasing the difficulty.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.466
The complexity will pick up a
little bit, but not the

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.060
difficulty.
 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.599
It's just you'll have to keep a
few more things in your head,

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.250
but the mathematics isn't any
harder.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.996
So we ended last time talking
about default and inferring

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:36.127
default probabilities,
and so I just want to finish

00:00:36.127 --> 00:00:38.590
off that discussion.
 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.051
So suppose that at any stage of
the tree, you know,

00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:44.890
lots of things can happen in
the world.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.127
We're always going to model the
uncertainty in the future by a

00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:50.250
tree with different things
happening,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.327
and at each of these nodes
people are going to have a

00:00:55.327 --> 00:00:56.890
discount rate.
 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.640
So maybe it'll be r equals 20
percent,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.438
and here r could equal 15
percent, something like that,

00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:12.658
and we want to add to this the
possibility that there's

00:01:12.658 --> 00:01:13.438
default.
 

00:01:13.438 --> 00:01:18.397
So if we add the possibility of
default, and these things keep

00:01:18.397 --> 00:01:22.786
going and maybe there are
payoffs at the end or payoffs

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:24.250
along the way.
 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.430
If at any point in the tree
like this one we add a new

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.522
possibility,
which is the default

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:37.584
possibility, so this happens--
by the way, when do people

00:01:37.584 --> 00:01:37.970
default?
 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.300
They never default before they
have to make a payment.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.833
So when do they default,
exactly when they're supposed

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:43.790
to make a payment.
 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.575
So suppose that this guy is
going to default here when he's

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.720
going to make a payment.
 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.530
At every possible scenario he
would default there.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.976
So we've got a very simple
model of default,

00:01:56.976 --> 00:02:01.704
so not a very realistic one
where the guy defaults in all of

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:04.109
these following scenarios.
 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.099
So something's just bad.
 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.896
Once he's gotten here you know
that he's not going to make the

00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:10.090
payment the next period.
 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.413
We further assume that not only
does he default there,

00:02:13.413 --> 00:02:16.110
but he defaults on everything
thereafter.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.008
So the payoff is just going to
be 0 here.

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:20.852
So this is going to
be--originally we had

00:02:20.852 --> 00:02:23.055
probabilities p_1,
p_2,

00:02:23.055 --> 00:02:24.771
p_3,
let's say for the

00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:28.938
probabilities,
now we're going to have

00:02:28.938 --> 00:02:37.759
probabilities d for default and
then 1 - d times all of these,

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:38.680
right?
 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.800
So essentially what have we
done?

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.745
We've simply replaced in our
calculation of payoffs and

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:47.478
present values,
we've simply replaced these

00:02:47.478 --> 00:02:49.788
possibilities with probability
p_1,

00:02:49.788 --> 00:02:51.470
p_2,
p_3.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.758
We added another possibility,
but the payoffs are 0 here.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:57.378
Nothing's going to happen from
then on except 0,

00:02:57.378 --> 00:02:59.740
and we said that happened with
probability d,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.299
which means presumably,
all of these have to be scaled

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.280
down by that so they still add
up to 1.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:18.110
So essentially the point I'm
trying to make is that default

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:29.080
that leads to 0 payoffs
thereafter is just like

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.090
discounting more.
 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.960
Why is that?
 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.662
Because whatever calculation
you did for the value here of

00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:41.910
what the bond could possibly be
worth there is--

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.147
it's all the same numbers as
there were before except we've

00:03:45.147 --> 00:03:48.910
multiplied it by 1 - d,
so it's the same thing.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:57.622
So instead of going 1 over 1 r
times future payoffs,

00:03:57.622 --> 00:04:07.188
that's no default value,
so that times future payoffs.

00:04:07.188 --> 00:04:13.679
Now we've got default value
under this special kind of

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:20.903
default is going to be 1 - d
times 1 over 1 r times the same

00:04:20.903 --> 00:04:23.230
future payoffs.
 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.139
I could rewrite 1 - d as 1 over
1 s or something,

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:36.649
and so then I really have just
1 over 1 r times 1 over 1 s.

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:41.800
So that's just 1 over (1 r s r
s).

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:55.379
So that's going to equal 1 over
(1 r s r s) times future values.

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.600
So the effect of this special
kind of default--we just get 0

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.528
thereafter.
 

00:05:00.528 --> 00:05:02.913
The guy decides after this
payment, "I'm not going to

00:05:02.913 --> 00:05:03.959
make any more payments.
 

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:05.439
I'm defaulting from then
on."

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:10.079
That's the same thing when
valuing the future payoffs,

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:13.528
it's the same thing as instead
of discounting by r,

00:05:13.528 --> 00:05:18.899
discounting by r s with a
little bit r times s.

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:20.899
If r and s are small numbers
this [r times s]

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:22.490
is probably quite a small
number.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:30.300
So default probabilities get
mapped into spreads they're

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.579
called.
 

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:36.430
They way to evaluate it is just
you just multiply it by 1 - d,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.730
which is the same thing as
discounting by a higher number,

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.600
and that higher number is
almost the same.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.103
It's very close to r d,
as a matter of fact,

00:05:46.103 --> 00:05:48.550
because 1 - d is 1 over 1 s.
 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:06:01.680
If d is very small s is going
to be very close to d as well.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.360
So what's the implication of
this?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.752
The implication of this in a
special case again where we just

00:06:10.752 --> 00:06:16.420
have no uncertainty,
except we have default.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.278
So here there could be
d_1,

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:22.420
1 - d_1 and here
there could be probability of

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.232
default 2 and 1 - d_2,
probability of default 3,1 -

00:06:27.232 --> 00:06:30.870
d_3,
and we've got interest rates

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.959
r_0--
so this will be i_0,

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:40.940
i^(F)_1,
i^(F)_2.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.067
So if you knew what the
interest rate was going to be

00:06:44.067 --> 00:06:45.668
today,
you knew what the interest rate

00:06:45.668 --> 00:06:47.735
was going to be tomorrow,
you knew what the interest rate

00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:49.250
was going to be the day after
tomorrow,

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.120
there's no uncertainty about
interest rates,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.894
they're perfectly
anticipatable,

00:06:52.894 --> 00:06:55.983
but you know that there's a
probability of default each

00:06:55.983 --> 00:06:56.500
time.
 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.956
So in stage 1 this guy might
default before making his

00:06:59.956 --> 00:07:02.826
payment here,
which case you're just going to

00:07:02.826 --> 00:07:03.480
get 0.
 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.033
In stage 2 he might default
instead of making his payment,

00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:09.528
won't pay the coupon,
he'll just default,

00:07:09.528 --> 00:07:11.649
or in year 3 he might default.
 

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:17.350
So what's the implication of
what we just said?

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:23.088
You can evaluate this bond,
the payoffs of the bond,

00:07:23.088 --> 00:07:28.040
so let's say it pays a coupon,
C, C 100 C.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.728
All right, the way you would
evaluate that without default is

00:07:31.728 --> 00:07:34.620
you would just take the value of
the coupon,

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:41.124
the present value would have
been--you would have done it

00:07:41.124 --> 00:07:42.750
recursively.
 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:48.649
You would have gotten
P_3 = 100 C.

00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:51.230
Then you would have said
P_2,

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.040
you would have gone in your
computer--

00:07:53.040 --> 00:08:00.475
you would have said
P_2 is 1 over (1

00:08:00.475 --> 00:08:05.930
i^(F)_2) times 100 C.
 

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.829
So the value here is the 100 C
discounted by that forward rate,

00:08:09.829 --> 00:08:15.132
then P_1 would have
been (C P_2) divided

00:08:15.132 --> 00:08:17.560
by (1 i^(F)_1).
 

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.420
So you take the value here
times that,

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.060
so this is case there's no
default,

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:27.975
and P_0 would have
been (C P_1) over (1

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:30.480
i^(F)_0).
 

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.139
So that's how you would have
done it by backward induction.

00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:37.461
But now that you know there's a
chance that there's default you

00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:40.668
have to not multiply by 1
i^(F)_2.

00:08:40.668 --> 00:08:44.764
You have to multiply all these
things by the probability of

00:08:44.764 --> 00:08:45.470
default.
 

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:51.616
So you'd have to multiply this
by, if we change colors,

00:08:51.616 --> 00:08:52.870
by 1 - d.
 

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:58.730
You have to multiply this by 1
- d_2,

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:03.750
and you'd have to multiply this
by (1 - d_1) times (1

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.597
- d_2),
and this by 1 -,

00:09:07.597 --> 00:09:13.028
sorry this would be 1 -
d_3.

00:09:13.028 --> 00:09:17.072
This is (1 - d_3)
times d_2,

00:09:17.072 --> 00:09:22.404
and this is (1 - d_1)
times (1 - d_2) times

00:09:22.404 --> 00:09:24.470
(1 - d_3).
 

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.993
So this value would be the old
value you got here multiplied by

00:09:27.993 --> 00:09:30.606
1 - d_3,
multiplied by this one minus

00:09:30.606 --> 00:09:31.629
d_3.
 

00:09:31.629 --> 00:09:34.240
This value is what you would
have gotten here,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.374
but you've already scaled it
down, so multiplied by 1 -

00:09:37.374 --> 00:09:40.159
d_2 and this is 1 -
d_1.

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:45.950
So what's the upshot?
 

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:53.090
So that gives you the price
with default.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.720
Student: Professor?
 

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.480
Prof: Yep?
 

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.801
Student: When you're
doing the backwards induction

00:09:57.801 --> 00:10:01.359
should you be tacking on like
that or should we just take one

00:10:01.359 --> 00:10:02.190
at a time.
 

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.361
So P_0 should be
multiplied by all 3,

00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:08.740
or isn't it that you're taking
whatever you get as

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.190
P_1 as given and just
multiply by...

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.740
Prof: Well,
I could have done it two ways.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.975
I could have written--so what
you're suggesting is a better

00:10:16.975 --> 00:10:19.428
way would have been to say
P_2,

00:10:19.428 --> 00:10:25.365
the default bond P_2
is going to be (1 -

00:10:25.365 --> 00:10:29.970
d_3) times
P_3,

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.086
which is also equal to
P_3 because there's no

00:10:33.086 --> 00:10:34.299
default after here.
 

00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:35.120
The world just ends.
 

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:41.177
Then P_1 is equal to
(1 - d_2) times

00:10:41.177 --> 00:10:45.722
P_2,
but that P_2,

00:10:45.722 --> 00:10:50.952
remember, is already (1 -
d_3) times

00:10:50.952 --> 00:10:52.928
P_3.
 

00:10:52.928 --> 00:10:59.317
And then P_0 is going
to be (1 - d_1) times

00:10:59.317 --> 00:11:03.750
(1 - d_2) times
P_1,

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.899
but that's equal to (1 -
d_1) times (1 -

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:11.120
d_2( times
P_1,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:18.700
which is (1 - d_3)
times P_3,

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.178
right?
 

00:11:22.178 --> 00:11:24.841
So all right,
if you go from here to here the

00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:27.865
value here's 100 C,
so if P_3 is just 100

00:11:27.865 --> 00:11:29.679
C let's leave it as 100 C.
 

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:33.658
That's if the guy actually pays.
 

00:11:33.658 --> 00:11:40.081
So the present value would just
be--oh, then you have to divide

00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:43.190
all this by 1 i_2.
 

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.200
Sorry, this is 1
i^(F)_2.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.360
Oh, I'm making a mess of this.
 

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.989
So usually you'll go back from
here to here by discounting by

00:11:53.989 --> 00:11:56.735
the interest rate,
but now we're going to have to

00:11:56.735 --> 00:11:59.635
also multiply by the probability
that you default to go back

00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:00.029
here.
 

00:12:00.029 --> 00:12:01.278
So we get a lower number.
 

00:12:01.278 --> 00:12:04.785
P_2 is not just (100
C) divided by (1 i^(F)),

00:12:04.785 --> 00:12:08.096
that's the discounting,
you also have to multiply by

00:12:08.096 --> 00:12:10.110
the probability of default.
 

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.657
Then when you go back one
period further you have to

00:12:13.657 --> 00:12:14.840
discount again.
 

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.284
So I should have divided this
by 1 i^(F)_1,

00:12:18.284 --> 00:12:21.797
you have to discount it,
and also you have to multiply

00:12:21.797 --> 00:12:24.048
by the probability of default.
 

00:12:24.048 --> 00:12:26.857
But the thing you're bringing
backwards is P_2,

00:12:26.857 --> 00:12:29.566
which has already taken into
account the probability of

00:12:29.566 --> 00:12:30.870
default the next time.
 

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:38.402
Then when you go back one step
further you have to do the whole

00:12:38.402 --> 00:12:43.870
thing again divided by 1
i^(F)_0.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.355
Student: You shouldn't
have a 1 - d_2 in

00:12:47.355 --> 00:12:49.533
there as well,
shouldn't you just be

00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:52.210
discounting by 1 - d_1
and 0?

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.658
Prof: This is
P_1 not P_2.

00:12:56.658 --> 00:13:00.190
Student: You've already
discounted by 1 - d_2.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:04.918
Prof: No,
but I'm switching the Ps on

00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:05.580
you.
 

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:12.034
When we go from here the value
here we just calculated was

00:13:12.034 --> 00:13:16.802
going to be P_2,
so here the value of

00:13:16.802 --> 00:13:20.359
P_1 taking into
account default is (1 -

00:13:20.359 --> 00:13:23.250
d_2) times
P_2,

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:28.100
which already takes into
account the default next time,

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.690
times P_2 discounted
by the interest rate here.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.970
So I've got the 1 -
d_2 here.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.190
Now, when I discount back to
here you're saying,

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.296
"How come the
d_2's showing up any

00:13:38.296 --> 00:13:40.139
more because I'm just at
d_1,

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:41.169
that's your question, right?
 

00:13:41.169 --> 00:13:42.720
So it doesn't show up.
 

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.259
It's just P_0 is 1 -
d_1--

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:48.570
oh, you're asking this,
you're right,

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.330
(1 - d_1)--you were
right--

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:57.798
times P_1 divided by
(1 i^(F)_0).

00:13:57.798 --> 00:13:59.522
That's right,
but if I plug in for

00:13:59.522 --> 00:14:01.139
P_1,
P_1 already

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:02.808
had--that's where the
d_2 came from,

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:04.558
so P_1's got the
d_2 in it.

00:14:04.558 --> 00:14:07.104
So it's (1 - d_1)
times (1 - d_2) times

00:14:07.104 --> 00:14:08.947
P_2,
and then P_2 had a

00:14:08.947 --> 00:14:10.000
P_3 in it.
 

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.120
So I've got all the defaults in
it.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.600
Are you with me now?
 

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.302
So, sorry about that,
so you were right,

00:14:16.302 --> 00:14:17.090
I said it wrong.
 

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.279
So, but this isn't the point.
 

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:21.149
This was supposed to be obvious.
 

00:14:21.149 --> 00:14:22.090
I didn't even think about it.
 

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:27.639
The next step is the thing
that's not obvious.

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:29.418
Here are the potential cash
flows.

00:14:29.418 --> 00:14:31.168
You're discounting them by the
interest rate.

00:14:31.168 --> 00:14:33.543
You also have to discount it
again by the fact that the guy

00:14:33.543 --> 00:14:34.730
might not actually pay you.
 

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.470
So that gives you a lower
present value.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.817
Yellow P_2 is less
than the no default white

00:14:40.817 --> 00:14:42.129
P_2.
 

00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:44.475
When you discount again you're
discounting the yellow

00:14:44.475 --> 00:14:47.226
P_2 by the interest
rate here and also the fact that

00:14:47.226 --> 00:14:48.399
the guy might not pay.
 

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:52.717
So you have to multiply by 1 -
d_2 and also the fact

00:14:52.717 --> 00:14:55.479
that he might not pay,
the forward rate,

00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:58.240
and you keep moving that
backwards.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.929
So that was supposed to be
obvious even though I made it

00:15:03.929 --> 00:15:06.000
sound complicated.
 

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:23.957
What's slightly subtler is just
saying the same thing backwards

00:15:23.957 --> 00:15:38.730
which is, suppose I knew all
these forward rates.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:51.154
Suppose I had a bunch of bonds,
suppose I had American bonds,

00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:54.259
coupon bonds.
 

00:15:54.259 --> 00:15:57.690
So the American coupon bonds
are going to pay,

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:02.035
you know, the 1-year pays a
coupon C_1 and has a

00:16:02.035 --> 00:16:05.620
face of 100 and has a price
Pi_1.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.616
The 2-year American bond has a
coupon C_2,

00:16:08.616 --> 00:16:11.379
a face of 100,
and a price of Pi_2.

00:16:11.379 --> 00:16:14.846
And let's say the 5-year has
something, C_5,

00:16:14.846 --> 00:16:17.658
a face of 100 and a price
Pi_5.

00:16:17.658 --> 00:16:23.121
Now from that we know that we
can deduce what all the forwards

00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:23.659
are.
 

00:16:23.659 --> 00:16:30.460
We did that in the first class.
 

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:37.288
So now suppose at the same time
we have Argentina.

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:41.230
Many Argentine sovereign bonds
promise payments in dollars,

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:45.240
by the way, they're trying to
trade them internationally.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.552
So let's say we also have the
Argentina bonds

00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:54.359
C-hat_1,
100, Pi-hat_1,

00:16:54.359 --> 00:16:58.398
that's the 1-year,
down to the 5-year which is the

00:16:58.398 --> 00:17:03.471
Argentina C-hat_5,
100 and Pi-hat_5,

00:17:03.471 --> 00:17:04.848
its price.
 

00:17:04.848 --> 00:17:10.279
Now, let's suppose that
Argentina could default whereas

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:11.890
America can't.
 

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.596
So it's quite likely that
Pi-hat_1 will be less

00:17:14.596 --> 00:17:17.641
than the American Pi_1
and Pi-hat_5 is going

00:17:17.641 --> 00:17:20.009
to be less than the American
Pi_5,

00:17:20.009 --> 00:17:22.019
because all these bonds might
default.

00:17:22.019 --> 00:17:24.544
So if the coupons were the
same, if C-hat_1 was

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:27.203
the same as C_1 and
C-hat_5 was the same

00:17:27.203 --> 00:17:29.593
as C_5 the fact that
Argentina could default

00:17:29.593 --> 00:17:32.028
obviously would mean its bonds
would trade less for the

00:17:32.028 --> 00:17:33.019
American ones.
 

00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:37.169
So the question is can you
figure out the default

00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:42.441
probabilities very quickly in
Argentina without having to do a

00:17:42.441 --> 00:17:47.240
lot of complicated calculations,
and the answer is yes.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.058
And why is that?
 

00:17:48.058 --> 00:17:51.729
Because you could take this
data and you could say--so we

00:17:51.729 --> 00:17:53.630
could just erase this here.
 

00:17:53.630 --> 00:18:00.997
We could say,
assuming no default,

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:10.818
we could explain these prices
by finding,

00:18:10.818 --> 00:18:18.700
just like we did the America,
the Argentine forwards,

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:27.807
1 i-hat_0,
1 i-hat^(F)_1 and 1

00:18:27.807 --> 00:18:32.269
i-hat^(F)_4.
 

00:18:32.269 --> 00:18:34.029
So these are the Argentine
forwards.

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:37.214
Now, these forwards would be
much bigger than the American

00:18:37.214 --> 00:18:37.829
forwards.
 

00:18:37.829 --> 00:18:38.828
Why is that?
 

00:18:38.828 --> 00:18:42.720
Because the prices in Argentina
are so much lower.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.325
If you're assuming there is no
default, assuming no default,

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:49.257
contrary to fact,
how could you explain all these

00:18:49.257 --> 00:18:50.480
very low prices?
 

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.707
Well, you must think that in
Argentina they've got very high

00:18:53.707 --> 00:18:55.950
interest rates and very high
forwards,

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.298
so they're discounting more and
that's why they've got lower

00:18:59.298 --> 00:18:59.808
prices.
 

00:18:59.808 --> 00:19:02.479
And we know how to get those
forwards assuming there was no

00:19:02.479 --> 00:19:02.940
default.
 

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.660
So the trick,
I'm merely pointing out now,

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.170
is that if we now go back and
say, ah ha,

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.163
Argentina doesn't have
different forwards because

00:19:13.163 --> 00:19:16.217
anyone in Argentina--
the bonds are denominated in

00:19:16.217 --> 00:19:19.740
dollars precisely so that people
can be crossover investors.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.048
An American can put his money
in Argentina.

00:19:22.048 --> 00:19:25.567
An Argentine can put his money
in America, so you can move your

00:19:25.567 --> 00:19:26.930
money to either place.
 

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.598
So it must be that the forward
rates can't be different.

00:19:30.598 --> 00:19:33.374
If you knew for sure you were
going to get paid in Argentina

00:19:33.374 --> 00:19:35.960
you'd have to have the same
forward rates in America.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.200
So the reason these forward
rates are higher is because

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.000
there's a chance of default.
 

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.548
So what is the chance of
default?

00:19:44.548 --> 00:19:47.008
So I claim the chance of
default is, and I was

00:19:47.008 --> 00:19:49.740
supposedly--you're supposed to
realize this now.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:54.970
If I'd been clearer before you
would see where I'm going.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.650
The chance of default is
incredibly simple to find out.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:06.450
So it's 1 - d_t =
what?

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.328
Student:
&gt;

00:20:08.328 --> 00:20:12.000
Prof: But in terms of
forwards is what?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.548
It's not Pi--this Pi,
this isn't the 0 price.

00:20:14.548 --> 00:20:17.680
This is the big price of the
bonds.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.650
So it's not Pi-hat_t
over Pi_t.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:27.038
What is it though?
 

00:20:27.038 --> 00:20:29.230
Student: The ratio of
forwards?

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:38.828
Student: Pi_t
- &gt;

00:20:38.828 --> 00:20:45.631
Prof: This is going to
be a bigger number than that,

00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:51.730
and in fact that ratio is the
default probability.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:55.249
So this is assuming,
remember, that if the Argentine

00:20:55.249 --> 00:20:59.182
bond defaults at this period,
say, it's never going to pay

00:20:59.182 --> 00:21:00.838
anything after that.
 

00:21:00.838 --> 00:21:04.179
You're going to get 0 pay off
and all the other Argentine

00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:05.730
bonds will also default.
 

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.703
I claim that this [note:
meaning, (1 - d_t =

00:21:07.703 --> 00:21:09.864
(1 i^(F)_t-1) over (1
i-hat^(F)_t-1)) ]

00:21:09.864 --> 00:21:12.358
is going to be the easy way of
getting the default probability.

00:21:12.358 --> 00:21:15.929
And so the differences in the
forwards is just explained by

00:21:15.929 --> 00:21:19.930
the default probabilities and so
the extra Argentine interest,

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.624
if this [the denominator]
is a higher number than that

00:21:22.624 --> 00:21:26.670
[the numerator],
1 - d is approximately 1 over

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.576
(1 d),
and so it's basically if all

00:21:30.576 --> 00:21:37.016
the numbers i and d are small
then i-hat^(F)_t - 1

00:21:37.016 --> 00:21:41.710
is approximately i^(F)_t -
1,

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.263
the American one,
plus this default rate in

00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:46.279
Argentina.
 

00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:50.680
So I should probably have a hat
because I'm referring to

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.680
Argentina with the hat.
 

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.680
So why is that true.
 

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.599
I just argued it.
 

00:21:54.599 --> 00:22:01.808
How could that possibly be true?
 

00:22:01.808 --> 00:22:06.111
So you see what I'm claiming
that you have now a very simple

00:22:06.111 --> 00:22:09.756
algorithm for finding out,
inferring what Argentina

00:22:09.756 --> 00:22:11.358
default rates are.
 

00:22:11.358 --> 00:22:14.345
Again, I'm making a special
assumption that when Argentina

00:22:14.345 --> 00:22:15.759
defaults you get nothing.
 

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:17.068
That really isn't the case.
 

00:22:17.068 --> 00:22:19.505
There's some huge convention
that happens and all the

00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:21.519
countries get together they
defaulted on.

00:22:21.519 --> 00:22:24.443
They've got some big meeting,
and someone like Brady invents

00:22:24.443 --> 00:22:27.567
some idea where they'll owe less
and they will be a writing down

00:22:27.567 --> 00:22:29.400
of principal,
by the way.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:39.086
So whenever this happens there
is recovery after a writing down

00:22:39.086 --> 00:22:41.430
of principal.
 

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.483
So what all the countries do is
they say, "Okay,

00:22:43.483 --> 00:22:45.420
we know that you can't pay all
that you owe us.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.380
We'll settle for half of it.
 

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.679
We'll write down the principal
and we'll hold you to that half,

00:22:50.679 --> 00:22:51.848
or to a third of it.
 

00:22:51.848 --> 00:22:54.497
So this is one of the things we
curiously haven't done in

00:22:54.497 --> 00:22:56.859
America where all these
homeowners can't pay and we

00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:58.608
don't write down their
principal.

00:22:58.608 --> 00:23:00.078
We just throw them out of their
houses.

00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:04.250
But anyway, let's say you wrote
the principal down to 0 in that

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.259
special case.
 

00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:08.818
You could easily infer from the
price of the Argentine bonds

00:23:08.818 --> 00:23:12.380
what the default probabilities
were, and by this formula.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.670
And so the question is,
why is that true?

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.144
We know how to calculate the
forwards in America given the

00:23:21.144 --> 00:23:22.118
American data.
 

00:23:22.118 --> 00:23:23.920
That's was one of the first
things we did in class.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.181
We said that every American
company in the whole country,

00:23:27.181 --> 00:23:29.220
financial company,
is doing that.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.048
Everybody has those forwards
calculated.

00:23:32.048 --> 00:23:34.318
Now, if you're given the
Argentine data,

00:23:34.318 --> 00:23:36.906
which is, after all,
just coupons and the prices of

00:23:36.906 --> 00:23:38.911
the bonds,
you could find Argentine

00:23:38.911 --> 00:23:41.019
forwards assuming there's no
default.

00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:44.534
But there is default,
so it must be that they have

00:23:44.534 --> 00:23:48.048
access to the American interest
rates in forwards,

00:23:48.048 --> 00:23:50.990
but the Argentine bond might
default.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.519
Do you see what we did when we
did this calculation?

00:23:53.519 --> 00:23:57.596
The difference between the
backward induction in America

00:23:57.596 --> 00:24:01.526
from here to here was just
discounting by the American

00:24:01.526 --> 00:24:04.364
forward--
to go to Argentina we had to

00:24:04.364 --> 00:24:08.180
discount by the American forward
and multiply by 1 - d,

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.769
so discounting it again.
 

00:24:09.769 --> 00:24:11.450
So all I'm saying is that in
the U.S.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:16.288
when we went backwards we just
discounted by this thing.

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:27.342
In Argentina when you go
backwards you have to discount

00:24:27.342 --> 00:24:36.346
by this thing,
so those things have to be the

00:24:36.346 --> 00:24:38.190
same.
 

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:43.328
So the Argentinian discount is
like taking the--

00:24:43.328 --> 00:24:45.290
I hope I haven't got the
thing--so the American forwards

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.109
are going to be less than the
Argentine forwards.

00:24:47.109 --> 00:24:51.829
It's going to be like that.
 

00:24:51.829 --> 00:24:52.480
So that's it.
 

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.852
There's nothing else to show
except that whenever you're

00:24:55.852 --> 00:24:58.490
going backwards here you're
discounting--

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.491
remember, you're discounting by
the interest rate times the

00:25:02.491 --> 00:25:06.150
probability that you're actually
going to pay off,

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:13.829
so that's what it is in
Argentina.

00:25:13.829 --> 00:25:16.660
Hang on.
 

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:23.471
I hope I haven't inverted one
of these, yeah,

00:25:23.471 --> 00:25:25.019
exactly.
 

00:25:25.019 --> 00:25:28.069
So if you write 1 - d times the
American thing in the

00:25:28.069 --> 00:25:29.621
denominator,
so as I said,

00:25:29.621 --> 00:25:32.308
to do the discounting in
Argentina at every step from

00:25:32.308 --> 00:25:35.410
going back from here to here
what did we do in Argentina?

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.692
We simply took 1 - d-hat,
that was the default

00:25:39.692 --> 00:25:44.260
rate--hat--in Argentina,
and discounted it at the

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.259
American forward.
 

00:25:46.259 --> 00:25:48.130
So that's what I did here.
 

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:52.387
So if I take 1 - d-hat,
this is multiplied by 1,

00:25:52.387 --> 00:25:57.009
so I take 1 - d-hat^(
)multiplied by 1 over this.

00:25:57.009 --> 00:26:00.180
I just get one over the
Argentine discount,

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.969
and that's how we
calculated--that's how we went

00:26:02.969 --> 00:26:06.650
backwards with our recursion
just taking the interest rate,

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:11.064
the discount 1 over (1 i) times
(1 - d) and that's how we

00:26:11.064 --> 00:26:13.348
discounted going backwards.
 

00:26:13.348 --> 00:26:15.690
And so therefore in Argentina
if you're forgetting that

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.421
there's default and you're just
thinking you have to discount at

00:26:18.421 --> 00:26:20.719
the right rate and you're
getting this discount you're

00:26:20.719 --> 00:26:23.371
getting this number,
but in reality you should have

00:26:23.371 --> 00:26:25.048
been taking this divided by
that.

00:26:25.048 --> 00:26:28.888
So therefore figuring out this
and knowing that tells you what

00:26:28.888 --> 00:26:29.960
this has to be.
 

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.497
So it's extremely simple to
deduce what the market thinks

00:26:33.497 --> 00:26:36.593
Argentinian default
probabilities are year by year

00:26:36.593 --> 00:26:40.319
if you make the added assumption
that once they default they

00:26:40.319 --> 00:26:41.900
default completely.
 

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.592
And if you think you're only
going to get a little bit back,

00:26:44.592 --> 00:26:46.920
well then the calculation won't
change that much.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.180
Yeah?
 

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.750
Student: Can we also do
it by using the price of 0s?

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.426
Prof: Yeah,
so you could also do it by

00:26:53.426 --> 00:26:56.316
using the price of 0s,
but to me the best thing is,

00:26:56.316 --> 00:26:59.220
the easiest thing is using the
forwards,

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.279
but you can also do it by 0s.
 

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:05.019
So that's all I wanted to say.
 

00:27:05.019 --> 00:27:11.132
As I said, the one last thing
to say is that if these numbers

00:27:11.132 --> 00:27:17.040
are all small then 1 over 1 -
d--or, 1 - d is approximately

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.690
equal to 1 over (1 d).
 

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.808
If d is very small those are
practically the same things.

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:29.520
Then if you multiply 1 over (1
d) by 1 over (1 i) it's almost 1

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.390
over (1 d i),
so it's almost this thing.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.890
It's not quite true,
literally true,

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.327
but it's very close to say that
the gap between Argentinian

00:27:38.327 --> 00:27:41.942
forwards and American forwards
is just the default probability

00:27:41.942 --> 00:27:45.855
in Argentina,
and that reason is why it's

00:27:45.855 --> 00:27:48.490
called a default spread.
 

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.900
You just add some spread to the
interest rate.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.729
You can guess by the spread
what the probability of default

00:27:54.729 --> 00:27:55.058
is.
 

00:27:55.058 --> 00:27:59.213
If it's 8 percent interest
there and 3 percent interest

00:27:59.213 --> 00:28:03.444
here somebody must think the
probability of default is 5

00:28:03.444 --> 00:28:04.829
percent there.
 

00:28:04.829 --> 00:28:09.650
That's it.
 

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:15.625
So let's now move to a tree
where you have to make

00:28:15.625 --> 00:28:17.088
decisions.
 

00:28:17.088 --> 00:28:21.271
So I'm going to now describe
the method of backward induction

00:28:21.271 --> 00:28:24.410
which occurs over and over and
over again,

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:26.180
and we've used it a couple of
times,

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:33.779
but not in its subtlest form,
so backward induction.

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:36.950
Now, who first invested the
idea of backward induction?

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:41.792
Well, the first person who
spelled it out formally was

00:28:41.792 --> 00:28:45.086
Zermelo in 1910,
I think, that's within a couple

00:28:45.086 --> 00:28:47.282
of years,
a famous mathematician,

00:28:47.282 --> 00:28:49.068
Fraenkel-Zermelo Axioms.
 

00:28:49.068 --> 00:29:02.596
And he proved that chess--that
there's an optimal strategy in

00:29:02.596 --> 00:29:09.358
chess by backward induction.
 

00:29:09.358 --> 00:29:12.220
So, for example,
let's take a game.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.836
We always are on a tree,
but now we're going to use a

00:29:15.836 --> 00:29:18.690
slightly extended definition of
a tree.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.368
A tree is going to look like
this.

00:29:20.368 --> 00:29:23.127
So it's a root,
a finite number of branches

00:29:23.127 --> 00:29:26.608
from every--I don't want to
formally define a tree.

00:29:26.608 --> 00:29:29.040
You know what it sort of looks
like, and there's no reason why

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.511
the number of branches has to be
two or even has to be the same

00:29:31.511 --> 00:29:32.348
from every point.
 

00:29:32.348 --> 00:29:35.663
But the reason we're going to
extend it is,

00:29:35.663 --> 00:29:39.529
the node is going to be
described by who moves.

00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:43.828
So let's say white is moving
here and black is moving here.

00:29:43.828 --> 00:29:50.106
Now, let's say the outcomes are
a win for white,

00:29:50.106 --> 00:29:55.048
a win for black,
a draw, or a draw.

00:29:55.048 --> 00:29:58.160
So the question is,
so it's a two-move chess game,

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.480
white moves first up or down,
and then after white moves

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.380
black moves up or down and then
the game ends.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.634
And depending on where,
position you reach either it's

00:30:07.634 --> 00:30:09.599
a win for white,
a win for black,

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:10.460
or a draw.
 

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.420
So what should white do?
 

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:20.519
Assuming that black is a smart
player what should she do?

00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:22.009
So what did Zermelo do?
 

00:30:22.009 --> 00:30:24.242
He said not only there is an
optimal strategy,

00:30:24.242 --> 00:30:27.420
but you know what the outcome
should be with rational players.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:32.285
So Zermelo said if white goes
up then black is clearly going

00:30:32.285 --> 00:30:34.759
to go down and win the game.
 

00:30:34.759 --> 00:30:37.535
So white ought to be thinking
here, if I go up,

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:40.551
the game, although it won't end
for another period,

00:30:40.551 --> 00:30:41.880
it's already lost.
 

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.098
So the value of the game is
already 0.

00:30:45.098 --> 00:30:48.588
So this method of backward
induction attaches the value.

00:30:48.588 --> 00:30:52.535
Here we have values at the end,
and so to figure out what the

00:30:52.535 --> 00:30:56.678
right thing to do is by backward
induction you can propagate the

00:30:56.678 --> 00:30:58.058
values backwards.
 

00:30:58.058 --> 00:31:02.463
If black makes the right choice
here the payoff is black gets

00:31:02.463 --> 00:31:06.328
the negative of white,
so the right choices here are

00:31:06.328 --> 00:31:09.410
black could get negative 1 or
could get 0,

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:11.230
so black clearly wants to get 0.
 

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:14.563
So black could win the game by
moving down, so black surely

00:31:14.563 --> 00:31:15.538
will move down.
 

00:31:15.538 --> 00:31:18.960
So I should think of the game
as already lost here and pretend

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.324
that I had a shorter tree with
the final valuation of zero at

00:31:22.324 --> 00:31:23.108
this node.
 

00:31:23.108 --> 00:31:26.807
Similarly, if white goes down
it doesn't matter what black

00:31:26.807 --> 00:31:29.210
does the game is going to be
drawn.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.548
So white should think to
himself the game is already a

00:31:32.548 --> 00:31:33.808
draw if I go down.
 

00:31:33.808 --> 00:31:36.621
And now white has an easy
choice, do I want to move to a

00:31:36.621 --> 00:31:38.410
loss or do I want to move a
draw.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:42.150
So I could just pick a move for
black here.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:46.335
Clearly white is going to go
down and therefore with correct

00:31:46.335 --> 00:31:48.180
play the game is a draw.
 

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.150
So by backward induction you
figure out the correct play.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.578
Now, why is this surprising?
 

00:31:52.578 --> 00:31:55.898
Because chess has an incredibly
big tree, not an infinite tree,

00:31:55.898 --> 00:31:58.470
there are all these rules that
keep it finite.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:01.657
If you reach to the same
position three times it's

00:32:01.657 --> 00:32:02.960
considered a draw.
 

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.137
If you make something like 50
moves in a row without a pawn

00:32:06.137 --> 00:32:07.288
moving it's a draw.
 

00:32:07.288 --> 00:32:10.950
Whatever those rules are--I
used to play chess quite a bit.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:11.730
I've even forgotten.
 

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.125
But whatever those rules are
they're designed to make the

00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:15.710
game finite, so the tree is
finite.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.560
And so it's impossible to see
the whole tree,

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.058
and how should you know what to
do at the beginning?

00:32:22.058 --> 00:32:23.897
Well, you don't know what to do
at the beginning until you know

00:32:23.897 --> 00:32:25.470
what black's going to do
afterwards, and so what could

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:26.328
happen later in the tree.
 

00:32:26.328 --> 00:32:29.025
But if you were fast enough to
put the whole thing on a

00:32:29.025 --> 00:32:32.068
computer you could figure out
what to do at the beginning,

00:32:32.068 --> 00:32:34.726
because your best move at the
beginning depends on what you

00:32:34.726 --> 00:32:37.509
think black is going to do next,
which depends on what he thinks

00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:40.106
you're going to do after that,
which depends on what you think

00:32:40.106 --> 00:32:41.038
he'll do after that.
 

00:32:41.038 --> 00:32:43.731
But if the tree ends you can
always go backward from the end

00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:46.151
to the beginning and figure out
what to do at the very

00:32:46.151 --> 00:32:46.788
beginning.
 

00:32:46.788 --> 00:32:49.445
So this is a familiar argument
to all of you,

00:32:49.445 --> 00:32:50.048
I think.
 

00:32:50.048 --> 00:32:55.482
It was a beautiful argument in
chess in 1910 and then it was

00:32:55.482 --> 00:32:59.720
anticipated--I mean,
in mathematics in 1910.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.720
The chess players,
of course, all knew about it,

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:08.558
so Steinitz who was a world
champion from when to when,

00:33:08.558 --> 00:33:14.829
something like 1870 or so to,
or 1880 let's say to let's see,

00:33:14.829 --> 00:33:18.108
19,21, to 1894.
 

00:33:18.108 --> 00:33:19.599
I think he was world champion
from then to there.

00:33:19.599 --> 00:33:22.140
Lasker became the champion then.
 

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:26.271
So he wrote a bunch of books
and stuff in which he said

00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:29.868
there's a backward induction
value to chess,

00:33:29.868 --> 00:33:33.324
but since we can't figure that
out on general principles you

00:33:33.324 --> 00:33:36.720
can tell by looking at the
configuration of pieces what the

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:44.435
right possible move is,
and so you can have positional

00:33:44.435 --> 00:33:47.440
values,
so I'll do that,

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.348
and then you can have the
backward induction values.

00:33:51.348 --> 00:33:56.143
So for instance a positional
value might tell you that having

00:33:56.143 --> 00:34:00.076
doubled pawns is a bad thing,
having control of the center's

00:34:00.076 --> 00:34:02.967
a good thing and you add up all
those pluses and minuses and you

00:34:02.967 --> 00:34:04.390
get these positional values.
 

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:11.039
And so he said if you've got
the right positional algorithm,

00:34:11.039 --> 00:34:14.231
right positional understanding,
your positional sense of what

00:34:14.231 --> 00:34:16.655
to do,
you only need to analyze one

00:34:16.655 --> 00:34:17.420
move deep.
 

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.916
You can figure out what the
best position's going to be and

00:34:19.916 --> 00:34:21.807
move that way,
and if you really understand

00:34:21.807 --> 00:34:23.670
the game properly that
positional thinking,

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:26.909
that strategic thinking,
so it's called strategic

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:30.083
thinking,
is going to give you the same

00:34:30.083 --> 00:34:33.751
decision as the exhaustive
analysis of all the

00:34:33.751 --> 00:34:37.500
possibilities which was tactical
thinking,

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.590
so the two should amount to the
same thing.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.251
Now, in fact,
people can't do the full

00:34:41.251 --> 00:34:43.811
tactical thing and also they
don't have the full strategic

00:34:43.811 --> 00:34:46.456
understanding either,
so they kind of mix strategy

00:34:46.456 --> 00:34:49.409
and tactics and that's what
makes the game interesting.

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:52.344
So no one has ever written
this, but I'm sure there's an

00:34:52.344 --> 00:34:55.547
interesting study to be made
about what games are interesting

00:34:55.547 --> 00:34:58.590
and they must be the kinds of
games where there's always a

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:00.619
mixture of strategy and tactics.
 

00:35:00.619 --> 00:35:02.925
In game theory,
as we describe it in economics,

00:35:02.925 --> 00:35:04.730
there's no such thing as
strategy.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:05.730
All this is out.
 

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:08.068
It's all just backward
induction, which is what I'm

00:35:08.068 --> 00:35:08.768
teaching you.
 

00:35:08.768 --> 00:35:12.099
So the way computers play
chess, incidentally,

00:35:12.099 --> 00:35:17.739
is--and the guy who invented
this is Shannon,

00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:26.309
so he's a famous professor of
information systems,

00:35:26.309 --> 00:35:27.610
so an engineering professor.
 

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:30.318
So he said, well,
you can't look at the whole

00:35:30.318 --> 00:35:34.074
tree which is too long in chess,
so what you should do--so all

00:35:34.074 --> 00:35:35.860
this extends way further.
 

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.860
Maybe you can only look two
moves deep.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.733
So what Shannon recommended is
look as far as you can put in

00:35:41.733 --> 00:35:45.199
your computer,
apply some positional thinking

00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:49.820
to evaluate these positions at
the pseudo end of the tree.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.550
So it's really not a win for
white.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:54.476
Let's just pretend White's so
far ahead that we'll call it a

00:35:54.476 --> 00:35:56.559
win, and a loss,
and a draw, and a draw.

00:35:56.559 --> 00:35:58.679
That's just by looking at
positional values.

00:35:58.679 --> 00:36:01.630
And then having assigned those
terminal nodes values,

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:04.903
now by backward induction you
can figure out what the value is

00:36:04.903 --> 00:36:07.909
here and exactly what the right
first move to make is.

00:36:07.909 --> 00:36:10.360
And after white's move black
will come here,

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.666
black can now look two moves
deep, so black's going to look

00:36:13.666 --> 00:36:15.719
from here all the way down here.
 

00:36:15.719 --> 00:36:18.753
He's going to do his positional
evaluator to these nodes and try

00:36:18.753 --> 00:36:21.304
and figure out what they're
worth and then do backward

00:36:21.304 --> 00:36:23.760
induction to figure out what his
right move is.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.628
Anyway, that's basically the
idea of all chess algorithms,

00:36:26.628 --> 00:36:29.447
and then they've gotten refined
by saying--wait a minute,

00:36:29.447 --> 00:36:31.159
there are lots of refinements.
 

00:36:31.159 --> 00:36:32.440
So I used to very interested in
this.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.610
I don't think I'll talk more
about it unless anyone wants to

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:35.309
ask me something.
 

00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:37.869
So there's the origin of
backward induction,

00:36:37.869 --> 00:36:41.827
Zermelo's proof and it's
obviously a big deal in chess

00:36:41.827 --> 00:36:46.159
and the chess players all knew
about it before Zermelo,

00:36:46.159 --> 00:36:48.610
but they didn't write anything
down as formal as Zermelo.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:52.889
So how does this apply to
everything we do in economics?

00:36:52.889 --> 00:36:57.135
Well, I want to give a series
of examples culminating in

00:36:57.135 --> 00:37:00.608
market examples,
but starting off a little far

00:37:00.608 --> 00:37:01.690
from life.
 

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:08.420
So the first one I want to give
is the red and the black.

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.610
So these are just two games.
 

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.594
This is the first one I
invented ten years ago,

00:37:12.594 --> 00:37:14.733
but I don't think
they're--anyway,

00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:17.199
I think they aren't that
original.

00:37:17.199 --> 00:37:18.550
I thought they were when I
invented them.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.409
But anyway, so the red and the
black works like this.

00:37:21.409 --> 00:37:27.476
There's a deck of cards,
52 cards, a deck of 52 cards,

00:37:27.476 --> 00:37:32.971
so half of them are--26 red,
right, and 26 black,

00:37:32.971 --> 00:37:37.550
which is all I care about the
cards.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:39.619
And someone offers you a game
and they say,

00:37:39.619 --> 00:37:43.550
okay, the deck is upside down,
they've been shuffled,

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:47.262
you can turn over a card and if
it's black I'll pay you 1

00:37:47.262 --> 00:37:47.860
dollar.
 

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.329
If it's red you have to pay me
1 dollar.

00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:55.054
So I'm offering you this chance
to play this game and of course

00:37:55.054 --> 00:37:57.800
you can quit whenever you want
to.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.608
I can't keep forcing you to
play, so anytime you want to you

00:38:01.608 --> 00:38:02.320
can quit.
 

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:11.920
So that's the game,
can stop whenever you want.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.329
And once you draw the card you
throw it away.

00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:18.655
And so all these examples are
going to be examples of stopping

00:38:18.655 --> 00:38:22.414
games and you'll see in
economics that when you prepay

00:38:22.414 --> 00:38:27.309
on a mortgage or when you call a
bond you're stopping the thing,

00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:29.050
the contract's ending.
 

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:31.355
Life is going on,
but that contract is ending,

00:38:31.355 --> 00:38:33.659
so want to know,
when's the right time to take

00:38:33.659 --> 00:38:34.889
an action like that?
 

00:38:34.889 --> 00:38:38.221
So red and black is a simple
game like that where you turn

00:38:38.221 --> 00:38:39.039
over a card.
 

00:38:39.039 --> 00:38:41.719
If it's black,
you're in the black you win 1

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:42.280
dollar.
 

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.356
If it's red you lose 1 dollar
and you can stop whenever you

00:38:46.356 --> 00:38:46.849
want.
 

00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:51.163
So you have an option,
so call this an option,

00:38:51.163 --> 00:38:55.858
and most people totally
underestimate the value of

00:38:55.858 --> 00:38:57.010
options.
 

00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:00.867
So let's just figure out how to
figure out the optimal thing to

00:39:00.867 --> 00:39:01.179
do.
 

00:39:01.179 --> 00:39:02.530
What would you do in this game?
 

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.059
Would you play if I gave you
the chance to play?

00:39:05.059 --> 00:39:07.500
I think I did this on the very
first day.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.210
Yes, you're about to say
something?

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:12.610
Your hand twitched.
 

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.536
Student: I was going to
say we have deceasing marginal

00:39:15.536 --> 00:39:17.244
utility as well,
so assuming we have

00:39:17.244 --> 00:39:18.659
&gt;
 

00:39:18.659 --> 00:39:21.726
you wouldn't play the game
because you would derive less

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:24.123
utility from winning 1 dollar
than you would

00:39:24.123 --> 00:39:25.739
&gt;
 

00:39:25.739 --> 00:39:30.599
in magnitude that the loss
&gt;

00:39:30.599 --> 00:39:33.414
Prof: So I'm going to
now disagree with what you said,

00:39:33.414 --> 00:39:35.340
but it's very interesting what
he said.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.570
He said, look,
if you draw a card at the

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.889
beginning it's 50/50 whether
you're going to win or not.

00:39:40.889 --> 00:39:42.309
If you win you get 1 dollar.
 

00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:45.809
If you lose you lose 1 dollar,
50/50 chance.

00:39:45.809 --> 00:39:50.543
If you're a little bit afraid,
if a 1 dollar loss is more

00:39:50.543 --> 00:39:55.701
important to you than a 1 dollar
gain right away it's not very

00:39:55.701 --> 00:39:58.461
good odds,
I mean, it's barely even,

00:39:58.461 --> 00:40:02.164
and if you're a little bit risk
averse and it's barely even you

00:40:02.164 --> 00:40:03.239
shouldn't play.
 

00:40:03.239 --> 00:40:07.409
But now, is it really barely
even, this game?

00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:08.199
Yep.
 

00:40:08.199 --> 00:40:10.965
Student: Well,
I mean, I think you should play

00:40:10.965 --> 00:40:14.050
because even if you get the
first 26 red at that point just

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:17.135
go to the end and you haven't
lost anything except the time

00:40:17.135 --> 00:40:19.050
you've spent playing the game.
 

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:21.652
You might as well play on the
off chance that you'll get some

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:22.518
blacks ones first.
 

00:40:22.518 --> 00:40:24.617
Prof: Right,
so you can't possibly lose if

00:40:24.617 --> 00:40:25.579
you play this right.
 

00:40:25.579 --> 00:40:27.380
You can always go to the very
end of the deck.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.619
We're ignoring a good point.
 

00:40:29.619 --> 00:40:32.496
We're ignoring your utility of
time, so you can always go to

00:40:32.496 --> 00:40:34.789
the end of the deck and assure
yourself of 0.

00:40:34.789 --> 00:40:39.563
So this is actually a pretty
valuable option to be able to

00:40:39.563 --> 00:40:41.239
stop like he says.
 

00:40:41.239 --> 00:40:43.978
If the first one's black you
could stop and then you've won 1

00:40:43.978 --> 00:40:44.389
dollar.
 

00:40:44.389 --> 00:40:46.369
If a whole bunch of them are
red and you lose,

00:40:46.369 --> 00:40:49.099
well, you can always go to the
end of the deck and get zero.

00:40:49.099 --> 00:40:50.824
So you're never going to lose
and you have a chance of

00:40:50.824 --> 00:40:51.150
winning.
 

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:52.320
So obviously you should play.
 

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.188
Even if you are risk averse you
should play, but now the

00:40:56.188 --> 00:40:58.579
question is can we tell exactly.
 

00:40:58.579 --> 00:41:00.179
Suppose you're risk neutral?
 

00:41:00.179 --> 00:41:10.039
How many dollars do you expect
to win would you guess?

00:41:10.039 --> 00:41:11.409
Yep?
 

00:41:11.409 --> 00:41:12.110
Student: 0.
 

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.449
Prof: You'd expect to
get 0.

00:41:14.449 --> 00:41:17.811
Now he just made an argument
that you should expect more than

00:41:17.811 --> 00:41:20.780
0, because for instance he said
take this strategy.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.000
Pick a card.
 

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.869
If it's black you win 1 dollar,
quit.

00:41:24.869 --> 00:41:25.889
You're 1 dollar ahead.
 

00:41:25.889 --> 00:41:29.719
So at 50 percent of the time
you're plus 1 dollar.

00:41:29.719 --> 00:41:32.768
If it's red the first time just
close your eyes and play to the

00:41:32.768 --> 00:41:35.918
end of the game and you're going
to get 0 because you're going to

00:41:35.918 --> 00:41:37.639
win 26 times and lose 26 times.
 

00:41:37.639 --> 00:41:40.739
So that's equal to .5.
 

00:41:40.739 --> 00:41:44.340
So there's one strategy that
gets you 50 cents on average.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.250
You can't lose and half the
time you'll get 1 dollar,

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.489
but that may not be the best
strategy.

00:41:49.489 --> 00:41:54.967
Student: You can play a
bunch of times and at worst

00:41:54.967 --> 00:42:00.639
you'll break even and at best
you could get all 26 black.

00:42:00.639 --> 00:42:01.530
Prof: Right.
 

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.320
So he's saying this isn't
ambitious enough.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.445
This surely gets a half a
dollar, but you could do much

00:42:06.445 --> 00:42:06.800
better.
 

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.059
Like, let's just wait.
 

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:11.489
The first time suppose you get
1 dollar.

00:42:11.489 --> 00:42:14.858
Suppose you get black the first
time, so that gives you 1

00:42:14.858 --> 00:42:15.400
dollar.
 

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:19.869
Now, the trouble is the deck is
starting to turn against you.

00:42:19.869 --> 00:42:23.489
Now it's 25 blacks and 26 reds.
 

00:42:23.489 --> 00:42:26.400
So what would you do then?
 

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.070
Student: I'd stop.
 

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:30.800
Prof: You'd stop or keep
going?

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:36.481
Well, the deck is against you,
so now your very next draw is

00:42:36.481 --> 00:42:37.829
unfavorable.
 

00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:40.456
And, by the way,
playing to the end of the deck

00:42:40.456 --> 00:42:43.824
is going to lose you 1 dollar
because there are 25 black and

00:42:43.824 --> 00:42:45.630
26 red,
so this argument that if you

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:48.150
just play to the end of the deck
you'll break even it's not true

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.030
after you've already taken a
black one out,

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.860
so you could lose it.
 

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.059
From then on you're starting to
run a little bit of a risk.

00:42:54.059 --> 00:42:55.989
So we're ignoring risk aversion.
 

00:42:55.989 --> 00:42:57.610
We're just caring about
expected dollars.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:01.639
The fact is the deck is against
you, so should you play or not?

00:43:01.639 --> 00:43:05.889
And so first reaction is hell
no, the deck's against me.

00:43:05.889 --> 00:43:07.679
Why should I draw another card?
 

00:43:07.679 --> 00:43:10.630
But you still have the option
of going to the end of the deck,

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.391
so the most you could lose is 1
dollar if you went all the way

00:43:13.391 --> 00:43:15.289
to the end of the deck,
and who knows,

00:43:15.289 --> 00:43:18.481
maybe you'll get a run of more
black cards in the beginning and

00:43:18.481 --> 00:43:20.179
make a lot more than 1 dollar.
 

00:43:20.179 --> 00:43:24.349
So you should choose another
card.

00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:26.929
In which case if you get black
again--

00:43:26.929 --> 00:43:29.199
if you got red on the next card
you'd be breaking even,

00:43:29.199 --> 00:43:32.784
but now it's 25/25 and by the
previous argument it's obvious

00:43:32.784 --> 00:43:36.309
you should pick another one
because the worst you can do is

00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:37.829
break even from then.
 

00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:40.320
But what if you got two blacks
in a row?

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.750
Well, now the deck is way
against you.

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:48.773
It's 26 red and 24 black,
so now you've only got a 48

00:43:48.773 --> 00:43:53.989
percent chance of drawing a
black one the next time.

00:43:53.989 --> 00:43:56.650
The deck is going further
against you.

00:43:56.650 --> 00:44:00.329
Should you really draw another
card?

00:44:00.329 --> 00:44:02.280
It's more likely to be red.
 

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.309
Well, the answer is yes.
 

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:11.398
And suppose you got a black one
again, meaning you're three up,

00:44:11.398 --> 00:44:14.150
and now the deck is 26/23.
 

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:16.889
Sorry, I went the other way,
26 red, 23 black.

00:44:16.889 --> 00:44:19.130
It's getting further and
further against you.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.250
Should you draw another card?
 

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:25.929
Well, what you've got is you've
got a bad deck working against

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:30.380
you, but you've got this option
working in favor of you.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.179
So the question is just how
valuable is the option.

00:44:33.179 --> 00:44:36.014
And like I said,
people always underestimate the

00:44:36.014 --> 00:44:37.159
value of options.
 

00:44:37.159 --> 00:44:40.110
And so--okay, go ahead.
 

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:42.938
Student: Don't you want
to play until your

00:44:42.938 --> 00:44:46.179
lose-condition is either
balanced out or worse than your

00:44:46.179 --> 00:44:47.239
win condition?
 

00:44:47.239 --> 00:44:49.630
Prof: Yes,
but what is that condition?

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:52.960
Student: Thirteen blacks
&gt;

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.181
Prof: If you got ten
blacks in a row you would keep

00:44:56.181 --> 00:44:58.840
drawing blacks,
is that what you were saying?

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.344
Student: Well,
I mean, at that point if you

00:45:00.344 --> 00:45:01.880
assume that that's all
&gt;

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.155
, assuming that you pick
another red and then play out

00:45:05.155 --> 00:45:08.369
the end of the game you could
lose, it would be...

00:45:08.369 --> 00:45:09.389
Prof: Thirteen more.
 

00:45:09.389 --> 00:45:13.063
So you're saying you want to
keep drawing blacks until if you

00:45:13.063 --> 00:45:16.860
play to the end of the deck you
would lose as much as you'd won

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.329
up until that point.
 

00:45:18.329 --> 00:45:22.659
So you want to never run the
risk of losing more.

00:45:22.659 --> 00:45:24.601
But you see,
that strategy would get you to

00:45:24.601 --> 00:45:25.849
quit after the first one.
 

00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:29.855
After the first black if you
ran to the end of the--your

00:45:29.855 --> 00:45:32.039
strategy doesn't make sense.
 

00:45:32.039 --> 00:45:34.992
By going to the end of the deck
you're always going to undo

00:45:34.992 --> 00:45:37.130
everything you've won until that
point,

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:41.054
because you'll be zero no
matter what if you go to the end

00:45:41.054 --> 00:45:42.019
of the deck.
 

00:45:42.019 --> 00:45:43.820
Yep?
 

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.018
Student: Shouldn't you
quit whenever you have 1 dollar,

00:45:47.018 --> 00:45:51.570
because say if you have more
black cards than red cards then

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:54.809
the number of black cards left
in the...

00:45:54.809 --> 00:45:56.768
Prof: Deck is less...
 

00:45:56.768 --> 00:45:59.322
Student: Is lower than
the number of red cards left in

00:45:59.322 --> 00:46:01.789
the deck, so you should quit
whenever you have 1 dollar.

00:46:01.789 --> 00:46:02.768
Prof: No.
 

00:46:02.768 --> 00:46:07.320
So he's saying just the
commonsensical thing.

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.322
After you draw one black card
he would quit because now the

00:46:11.322 --> 00:46:12.840
deck is against you.
 

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.791
It's 25 red [correction:
26 red]

00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:16.050
and only 25 black.
 

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:17.239
The deck's against you.
 

00:46:17.239 --> 00:46:20.110
Why go on and play against an
unfavorable deck?

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:23.210
You've got your dollar,
be satisfied and quit.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:26.686
That's his recommendation,
but that's wrong and it's

00:46:26.686 --> 00:46:29.619
because you're doing what
everybody does.

00:46:29.619 --> 00:46:31.860
You underestimate the option.
 

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.503
The option is incredibly
valuable here and now I just

00:46:35.503 --> 00:46:39.496
want to show how to compute what
your optimal strategy is,

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:42.018
and I think you'll be
surprised.

00:46:42.018 --> 00:46:45.342
You should keep drawing,
not three times--if you got a

00:46:45.342 --> 00:46:47.976
fourth black card,
so you've already made 4

00:46:47.976 --> 00:46:48.730
dollars.
 

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:49.650
It's a sunk cost.
 

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:50.989
You've got this horrible deck.
 

00:46:50.989 --> 00:46:52.769
It's 26,22.
 

00:46:52.769 --> 00:46:53.989
Should you keep playing?
 

00:46:53.989 --> 00:46:55.190
Yes you should.
 

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:56.219
Yes you can.
 

00:46:56.219 --> 00:47:01.829
If you get a fifth black card
in a row you're up 5 dollars.

00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:03.929
The deck is horribly against
you.

00:47:03.929 --> 00:47:05.480
Should you keep playing?
 

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.789
Yes you should.
 

00:47:06.789 --> 00:47:10.239
So anyway, it's really
shocking, I think.

00:47:10.239 --> 00:47:13.014
So now let's just see how to
compute this out so that we

00:47:13.014 --> 00:47:14.579
don't have to argue about it.
 

00:47:14.579 --> 00:47:18.664
It's just a little bit of
mathematics and you just see how

00:47:18.664 --> 00:47:21.030
surprising this calculation is.
 

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:22.130
So how would you do it?
 

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:32.820
 
 

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:37.360
Well, the key is to figure out
how to put it into a tree.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.913
So I'm not going to draw the
picture because it gets too

00:47:39.913 --> 00:47:43.021
complicated,
but basically what you want to

00:47:43.021 --> 00:47:46.166
know is how valuable--
remember the tree in backward

00:47:46.166 --> 00:47:46.659
induction?
 

00:47:46.659 --> 00:47:50.851
It was, take the thing at the
end and then figure out by

00:47:50.851 --> 00:47:53.518
propagating the values
backwards.

00:47:53.518 --> 00:47:59.659
So if I have black and red
here, and I've got 1 black card

00:47:59.659 --> 00:48:04.289
and no red cards,
the value to me of that is

00:48:04.289 --> 00:48:05.260
what?
 

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.760
I'm going to win 1 dollar for
sure.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.251
If there's only 1 black card
left in the deck and no red

00:48:09.251 --> 00:48:12.059
cards I know I'm going to play
to the end and get 1 dollar,

00:48:12.059 --> 00:48:15.688
and obviously the value of 2
black cards and no red cards is

00:48:15.688 --> 00:48:16.980
2 dollars etcetera.
 

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:22.911
And I also know,
what's the value to me of no

00:48:22.911 --> 00:48:24.800
black cards?
 

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.460
You know at every stage what's
left in the deck because you've

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.639
seen what came up before.
 

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:32.721
So if you're at the very end of
the deck with no black cards and

00:48:32.721 --> 00:48:36.219
1 red card what's the value of
that position to you?

00:48:36.219 --> 00:48:36.789
Student: 0.
 

00:48:36.789 --> 00:48:39.722
Prof: 0,
not minus 1,0,

00:48:39.722 --> 00:48:41.139
why is that?
 

00:48:41.139 --> 00:48:44.724
Because you're going to quit,
you're not going to play and

00:48:44.724 --> 00:48:47.869
that's the critical step,
seeing that this is 0.

00:48:47.869 --> 00:48:49.460
Someone said minus 1.
 

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.148
That difference between 0 and
minus 1, that's the whole heart

00:48:52.148 --> 00:48:52.820
of the thing.
 

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.889
So 0 and 2, the value of that
is also 0.

00:48:55.889 --> 00:48:57.750
You're just going to quit.
 

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:01.820
So what in general is the value?
 

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:06.710
What is the value of V if there
are B black cards and R red

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:09.409
cards what's the value to you?
 

00:49:09.409 --> 00:49:16.420
Well, a crucial step is that
you can choose to quit by not

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.650
playing.
 

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:19.860
So this is the value from then
on to you.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:23.349
So B black cards left,
R red cards left.

00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:28.179
You could get 0 by quitting,
or you could draw a card.

00:49:28.179 --> 00:49:31.730
Now, what happens to you if you
draw a card?

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:34.409
What happens to you if you draw
a card?

00:49:34.409 --> 00:49:42.210
Well, with probability B over
(B R) you win 1 dollar,

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:49.110
right, but then you move on to
the new deck.

00:49:49.110 --> 00:50:00.010
So what do I write V here,
V of B - 1 and R,

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:09.289
but with probability R over (B
R), you drew a red card,

00:50:09.289 --> 00:50:16.307
so that's minus 1,
but then you move onto a deck

00:50:16.307 --> 00:50:22.340
that has 1 less red card,
and that's it.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:26.487
You either decide to stop or if
you've decided to draw a card

00:50:26.487 --> 00:50:30.360
you know what the chances of
getting a black card are.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:35.059
You look at the black cards, 26.
 

00:50:35.059 --> 00:50:35.889
I'm down there.
 

00:50:35.889 --> 00:50:37.610
It's 21 out of 47.
 

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:40.215
It sounds horrible,
21 out of 47,

00:50:40.215 --> 00:50:41.599
I win 1 dollar.
 

00:50:41.599 --> 00:50:44.369
26 out of 47 I lose 1 dollar.
 

00:50:44.369 --> 00:50:48.820
So the immediate draw is
terrible, but if I get a black

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:53.766
card I move to this situation,
and if I get a red card I move

00:50:53.766 --> 00:50:55.579
to this situation.
 

00:50:55.579 --> 00:51:04.920
So do you agree with me that
that's what the value's going to

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:05.699
be?
 

00:51:05.699 --> 00:51:07.710
Are there any questions?
 

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:09.820
This is a critical formula,
a critical spot.

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:15.500
Does everyone--Sophia you're
now in trouble.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.989
Somebody came and said hello to
me after class and now I know a

00:51:18.989 --> 00:51:21.239
name, so does this formula make
sense?

00:51:21.239 --> 00:51:23.039
Student: Yes.
 

00:51:23.039 --> 00:51:24.840
Prof: Kathleen, yes?
 

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.030
Is it Katherine or Kathleen?
 

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:27.079
Student: Katherine.
 

00:51:27.079 --> 00:51:27.820
Prof: Katherine, okay.
 

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:30.054
Katherine, so you agree with
this formula,

00:51:30.054 --> 00:51:30.489
right?
 

00:51:30.489 --> 00:51:32.349
But this formula's the key.
 

00:51:32.349 --> 00:51:34.050
It's just like our tree.
 

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:37.360
Once you know what the values
are down here you can always go

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.679
backwards and figure out the
value here.

00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:44.949
So what is the tree?
 

00:51:44.949 --> 00:51:47.795
The tree is going to
have--well, I'm going I'm going

00:51:47.795 --> 00:51:49.190
to do it on a computer.
 

00:51:49.190 --> 00:52:01.590
So now we can just do this on a
computer.

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:06.960
I hope I don't have to do that.
 

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:13.309
So you have this,
by the way, it's on the web.

00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:17.469
Oh no!
 

00:52:17.469 --> 00:52:19.440
Why are all these,
oh okay, there aren't question

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:19.769
marks.
 

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:20.829
So here it is.
 

00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:25.059
So you can see that on this,
I can do it with this,

00:52:25.059 --> 00:52:30.063
on this thing it's--by the way,
I did my own spreadsheet and an

00:52:30.063 --> 00:52:34.905
undergraduate last year thought
it was so messy that she just

00:52:34.905 --> 00:52:36.519
redid it for me.
 

00:52:36.519 --> 00:52:38.400
So this is her doing.
 

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.079
It looks much better than I did.
 

00:52:40.079 --> 00:52:42.010
So anyway, here are the number
of cards.

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:45.210
This is what the number of
black cards left.

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:47.670
This is the number of red cards
left,

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:51.400
and then when you go to the
corresponding coordinate like

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:54.407
this one,
this is the value of the game

00:52:54.407 --> 00:52:57.679
when you have 1 black card and 1
red card.

00:52:57.679 --> 00:53:00.876
Even though there's an even
deck it's a favorable game to

00:53:00.876 --> 00:53:01.219
you.
 

00:53:01.219 --> 00:53:02.130
Why is that?
 

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:04.536
Because you draw the first
card, if it's black,

00:53:04.536 --> 00:53:07.780
which happens with probability
50 percent, you win 1 dollar.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.960
So you've got half a dollar.
 

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.443
If it's red,
which happens with 50 percent

00:53:11.443 --> 00:53:15.199
probability, you draw the next
one and so you end up with 0.

00:53:15.199 --> 00:53:16.827
And by the way,
if you got a black the first

00:53:16.827 --> 00:53:17.849
time, obviously you stop.
 

00:53:17.849 --> 00:53:20.268
So you get 50 percent chance of
1 dollar and stopping or 50

00:53:20.268 --> 00:53:22.690
percent chance of going to the
end and getting nothing,

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:25.273
so it's value of 50 percent,
but that's a bad way of

00:53:25.273 --> 00:53:26.590
calculating that number.
 

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:29.159
She's got a much better way of
calculating it.

00:53:29.159 --> 00:53:33.422
So what she said is if you had
no red cards and only black

00:53:33.422 --> 00:53:37.836
cards the value is to go to the
end of the deck and just win

00:53:37.836 --> 00:53:38.809
them all.
 

00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:42.443
So if you've got only red cards
in the deck and the top line is

00:53:42.443 --> 00:53:45.610
no black cards obviously you
should quit right away.

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:49.110
So we've got this first thing
trivially done.

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:51.018
Now, how do you figure out this
thing?

00:53:51.018 --> 00:53:54.204
Well, if you look at the
formula up there it's just the

00:53:54.204 --> 00:53:56.916
formula you wrote,
we wrote, which is you could

00:53:56.916 --> 00:53:58.449
quit if you wanted to.
 

00:53:58.449 --> 00:54:01.929
So you have to take the max of
0, but if you go on and draw,

00:54:01.929 --> 00:54:05.702
I can't read what's written
there, if you go on and draw

00:54:05.702 --> 00:54:08.860
there's going to be the
probability of red,

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:12.422
this is the probability of
getting a red over the total

00:54:12.422 --> 00:54:15.130
number of cards times losing 1
dollar,

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:18.760
plus what happens is you then
move.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:29.969
If you drew red then you go
to--what did she do?

00:54:29.969 --> 00:54:32.768
Student:
&gt;

00:54:32.768 --> 00:54:33.610
the value.
 

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:36.641
Prof: C 4,
oh C 4 is here,

00:54:36.641 --> 00:54:37.400
right.
 

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.260
So sorry, I was getting
confused with the cards.

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:40.969
So C 4 is this squared.
 

00:54:40.969 --> 00:54:42.420
That's the value in here.
 

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.268
So C 4 says if you draw a red
card the first time,

00:54:45.268 --> 00:54:47.675
it happens with this
probability, the number of reds

00:54:47.675 --> 00:54:51.090
over the total number of cards,
you lose 1 dollar and then you

00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:53.963
move to the position C 4,
which is 1 back here,

00:54:53.963 --> 00:54:57.576
the one where you've got 1 less
red card and just a black card

00:54:57.576 --> 00:54:58.050
left.
 

00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:00.277
On the other hand,
you could have drawn the first

00:55:00.277 --> 00:55:02.215
time,
not the red one but the black

00:55:02.215 --> 00:55:04.539
one divided by the total number
of cards,

00:55:04.539 --> 00:55:06.802
and you would have won 1
dollar, but then you would have

00:55:06.802 --> 00:55:09.150
moved to the position where you
had 1 less black card,

00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:11.849
which is D 3, which is up here.
 

00:55:11.849 --> 00:55:14.873
So instead of doing the whole
game, she says,

00:55:14.873 --> 00:55:18.447
half the time you win,
but then you move over to here

00:55:18.447 --> 00:55:20.030
and get that value.
 

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:23.275
Half the time you lose,
and then you lose 1 dollar,

00:55:23.275 --> 00:55:25.420
and then you move over to here.
 

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:26.159
So she's done that.
 

00:55:26.159 --> 00:55:29.556
That same formula appears in
every box, so all you had to do

00:55:29.556 --> 00:55:30.650
was just copy it.
 

00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:33.139
It's max of 0,
and then the chance that you're

00:55:33.139 --> 00:55:36.112
going to lose 1 dollar,
which is the number here of

00:55:36.112 --> 00:55:39.744
reds over the totals times minus
1 dollar and then moving over to

00:55:39.744 --> 00:55:40.199
here.
 

00:55:40.199 --> 00:55:42.936
Or you could get the
probability of winning 1 dollar

00:55:42.936 --> 00:55:44.170
with the black cards.
 

00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:48.170
So you win 1 dollar,
but then you move up to here.

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:53.159
So it's very simple.
 

00:55:53.159 --> 00:55:54.860
So she's done it.
 

00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:57.807
And notice that although the
deck is even at 1 card each,

00:55:57.807 --> 00:56:00.018
so it sounds like a fair game,
it's not.

00:56:00.018 --> 00:56:02.235
It's a favorable game because
you have an option,

00:56:02.235 --> 00:56:04.865
so you all understood that,
but the thing is the option is

00:56:04.865 --> 00:56:06.619
much more valuable than you
think.

00:56:06.619 --> 00:56:09.949
So let's see what the value of
the game is.

00:56:09.949 --> 00:56:15.541
It's when you had 26 black
cards and 26 red cards,

00:56:15.541 --> 00:56:19.650
so we have to go way over to
here.

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:22.210
Sorry.
 

00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:23.639
Where am I going?
 

00:56:23.639 --> 00:56:24.570
That's not the right answer.
 

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:27.721
Here it is, 26,26,
the value of the game is 2.6

00:56:27.721 --> 00:56:30.050
dollars, not just half a dollar.
 

00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:32.353
You wanted to quit,
wherever you are,

00:56:32.353 --> 00:56:33.570
at half a dollar.
 

00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:35.150
He's not looking up anymore.
 

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:41.784
So he wanted to quit after the
first draw, but it's much better

00:56:41.784 --> 00:56:43.070
than that.
 

00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:47.561
So now what the shocking thing,
though, is, so this means with

00:56:47.561 --> 00:56:51.539
26,26 you have a favorable game
and you should draw.

00:56:51.539 --> 00:56:53.059
If you didn't draw it'd be
worth 0.

00:56:53.059 --> 00:56:54.518
So obviously you're supposed to
draw here.

00:56:54.518 --> 00:56:56.829
If you get a black card you're
going to go here.

00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:58.250
So here you're down.
 

00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:01.289
You've gotten a card and you've
got one more,

00:57:01.289 --> 00:57:03.969
you know, it wasn't that likely
you were going to get black,

00:57:03.969 --> 00:57:06.650
but if you did--50 percent
chance you go here.

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:09.820
So you win 1 dollar and now
you're at this position.

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:14.637
Now, if you're supposed to stop
at that point,

00:57:14.637 --> 00:57:17.530
what would you have done?
 

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:20.427
If you were supposed to stop at
that point you would have had

00:57:20.427 --> 00:57:20.909
value 0.
 

00:57:20.909 --> 00:57:23.534
So the fact that that number is
positive is telling you even

00:57:23.534 --> 00:57:26.831
when the deck is against you,
25, you can't see it,

00:57:26.831 --> 00:57:31.646
it's 25 blacks and still 26
reds it's still a favorable

00:57:31.646 --> 00:57:32.360
game.
 

00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:35.561
You should draw a card and if
by some miracle you won 1 dollar

00:57:35.561 --> 00:57:37.190
you would have moved to here.
 

00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:40.998
So now you're 26 red and 24
black, but the game is still

00:57:40.998 --> 00:57:41.829
favorable.
 

00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:47.012
You should draw another card,
and if you win again you're

00:57:47.012 --> 00:57:47.659
here.
 

00:57:47.659 --> 00:57:49.889
Now you've gone one,
two, three times you've drawn

00:57:49.889 --> 00:57:50.300
blacks.
 

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.710
You should still draw another
one.

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:54.829
Four times getting blacks you
should still draw another one.

00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:59.963
Five consecutive black draws
the deck is now 26 against you

00:57:59.963 --> 00:58:02.000
and 21 in your favor.
 

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.679
You should draw again.
 

00:58:03.679 --> 00:58:06.733
The game is still slightly
favorable, and it just seems

00:58:06.733 --> 00:58:10.295
shocking that could be the case,
but this is the proof that it's

00:58:10.295 --> 00:58:11.030
the case.
 

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:15.242
So anyway, that illustrates the
power of the option of being

00:58:15.242 --> 00:58:16.599
able to continue.
 

00:58:16.599 --> 00:58:19.472
And if you work,
you're going to work out low

00:58:19.472 --> 00:58:22.963
numbers 2 and 3 in the homework,
and then you'll see very

00:58:22.963 --> 00:58:25.769
clearly why it is that this
option is just so powerful.

00:58:25.769 --> 00:58:27.369
It's uncannily strong.
 

00:58:27.369 --> 00:58:29.170
So are there any questions
about this?

00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:30.018
Yes?
 

00:58:30.018 --> 00:58:32.110
Student: I'm still a
little bit confused.

00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:35.425
I know that the option value is
positive, but the probability

00:58:35.425 --> 00:58:37.579
actually is a little bit against
you.

00:58:37.579 --> 00:58:44.139
So especially after five wins
why do you want another draw,

00:58:44.139 --> 00:58:46.625
because yes,
the option value is a little

00:58:46.625 --> 00:58:49.989
bit positive,
but the probability is still

00:58:49.989 --> 00:58:51.090
against you?
 

00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:52.170
Prof: This isn't the
option value.

00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:54.369
This is the value of playing.
 

00:58:54.369 --> 00:58:58.103
So it says the option value is
more important than the fact

00:58:58.103 --> 00:59:00.230
that the cards are against you.
 

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:03.005
So he's asking,
my TA is asking,

00:59:03.005 --> 00:59:08.199
how could it possibly be that
the deck is now 26 red and 21

00:59:08.199 --> 00:59:13.391
black totally against you and
according to this calculation

00:59:13.391 --> 00:59:15.900
you should still draw?
 

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:19.039
He can't see the advantage in
drawing because the odds are

00:59:19.039 --> 00:59:22.070
pretty high you're going to get
a red card next time.

00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:23.420
Well, that's true.
 

00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:28.106
You're going to get a red card
next time, but the thing is your

00:59:28.106 --> 00:59:29.768
downside is limited.
 

00:59:29.768 --> 00:59:30.849
Here's a way of thinking about
it.

00:59:30.849 --> 00:59:34.369
You're up 5 cards.
 

00:59:34.369 --> 00:59:37.282
You can never lose more than 5
dollars from that point on

00:59:37.282 --> 00:59:40.090
because you can always play to
the end of the deck,

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:44.869
right, which means you lose the
five back that you already won.

00:59:44.869 --> 00:59:48.125
So there's a downside--the
downside of losing is limited

00:59:48.125 --> 00:59:48.539
here.
 

00:59:48.539 --> 00:59:51.550
On the other hand there's a big
upside to you.

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:56.842
You might by some miracle draw
10 consecutive black ones at

00:59:56.842 --> 01:00:00.219
that point and then you could
quit.

01:00:00.219 --> 01:00:02.400
So your upside is much bigger
than your downside.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.862
Now, the upside is less
probable than the downside so

01:00:04.862 --> 01:00:07.230
it's not so obvious which is
going to be bigger.

01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:09.581
Is the option value more
important or is the fact that

01:00:09.581 --> 01:00:11.400
the deck is against you more
important?

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.465
It would be impossible to
intuit the answer,

01:00:13.465 --> 01:00:15.050
but we don't have to intuit it.
 

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:16.349
We just proved it.
 

01:00:16.349 --> 01:00:21.630
We solved for the optimal
strategy.

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:23.219
Are there any other questions?
 

01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:27.273
It's quite amazing,
right, this--I'm going to pause

01:00:27.273 --> 01:00:28.489
for a second.
 

01:00:28.489 --> 01:00:29.429
Yes?
 

01:00:29.429 --> 01:00:32.288
Student: How do you
calculate the profit at a given

01:00:32.288 --> 01:00:32.840
position?
 

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.670
Prof: That's what we
just did.

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:40.489
So let's try it again.
 

01:00:40.489 --> 01:00:46.130
Student: It may not be a
total profit.

01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:50.409
Prof: So what we did,
this number V is the expected

01:00:50.409 --> 01:00:55.626
profit you're going to make if
you start with B black cards and

01:00:55.626 --> 01:00:56.889
R red cards.
 

01:00:56.889 --> 01:01:01.862
And now the intuitive mind
figures that if B is less than R

01:01:01.862 --> 01:01:06.579
you've got an unfavorable deck
and you should just quit,

01:01:06.579 --> 01:01:08.980
but that's not the case.
 

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.295
You can figure out what the
profit is, how,

01:01:11.295 --> 01:01:12.949
by doing backward induction.
 

01:01:12.949 --> 01:01:15.557
You couldn't tell what the
value of this bond is here with

01:01:15.557 --> 01:01:18.076
all these defaults and stuff
until you started computing

01:01:18.076 --> 01:01:21.130
backwards until you got to here,
so the same way here.

01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:24.989
We know at the edges it's very
obvious when all the cards are

01:01:24.989 --> 01:01:27.947
black or all the cards are red,
that's up here,

01:01:27.947 --> 01:01:30.199
it's obvious what the value is.
 

01:01:30.199 --> 01:01:33.565
But if you have a position here
you can figure out what the

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:36.349
value is of being in that
position of 1 and 1.

01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:38.210
You could quit and be 0,
or you could say,

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:40.750
what are my chances of getting
a black card and winning 1

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:41.250
dollar?
 

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:43.610
If I get a black card then I
move to this position,

01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:46.349
but I already figured out this
position's value because I'm

01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:48.050
doing backward induction,
right?

01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:51.820
That's got one less--sorry,
if I draw a black card I go

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.590
this way.
 

01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:55.465
It's got 1 less black card and
we already know that value of

01:01:55.465 --> 01:01:56.489
that position is 0.
 

01:01:56.489 --> 01:01:59.262
So to figure out the value of
this position I know the chance

01:01:59.262 --> 01:02:01.621
of getting a black card,
then I'm going to end up in

01:02:01.621 --> 01:02:03.239
that position which is value 0.
 

01:02:03.239 --> 01:02:05.610
I won't draw any more.
 

01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:09.054
Or I'm going to get a red card
and then I'm going to move to

01:02:09.054 --> 01:02:12.559
this position over here whose
value I've already computed.

01:02:12.559 --> 01:02:14.460
So that gives me the value here.
 

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.449
How do I figure out the value
here?

01:02:16.449 --> 01:02:19.630
Well, it's now 2 reds and 1
black.

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:21.000
So this looks really bad.
 

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.907
Actually this position,
the value of this I happen to

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:25.809
know is 0.
 

01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:27.985
How could it be,
with 2 red cards and only 1

01:02:27.985 --> 01:02:30.670
black card actually the value of
the position is 0?

01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:31.909
Well, what do I do?
 

01:02:31.909 --> 01:02:36.018
The chances of getting a black
card the first time are 1 third.

01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:40.349
So V of (1,2) is going to be 1
third of getting a black card

01:02:40.349 --> 01:02:44.972
plus then I go to here which is
no black cards left and just red

01:02:44.972 --> 01:02:48.650
cards,
which obviously is 0,

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:50.699
plus 2 thirds.
 

01:02:50.699 --> 01:02:53.800
2 thirds of the time I get a
red card and lose 1 dollar,

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.842
but then I'm going to move to
here with 1 red card where I

01:02:56.842 --> 01:02:59.182
have V of (1 and 1),
which I've already figured out

01:02:59.182 --> 01:03:00.000
the answer to,
right?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.989
This was V of (1 and 1) has
value a half.

01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:09.617
So therefore V of (1 and 2) is
going to be 2 thirds times minus

01:03:09.617 --> 01:03:11.260
1 V of (1,2),
right?

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:15.021
I just drew a black card so
it's no longer--no,

01:03:15.021 --> 01:03:18.210
I drew a red card,
so it's (1 and 1).

01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:20.260
So I started with 1 black and 2
reds,

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.099
1 third of the time I get a
black card,

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:24.510
2 thirds of the times I get a
red card,

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:28.143
but after getting the red card
the position is now 1 black and

01:03:28.143 --> 01:03:28.619
1 red.
 

01:03:28.619 --> 01:03:30.110
The red card disappeared.
 

01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:31.190
That's over here.
 

01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:33.489
So I get a black card,
I move to here.

01:03:33.489 --> 01:03:35.909
If I get a red card I move to
there,

01:03:35.909 --> 01:03:42.842
but V of (1,1) is worth a half,
so that's equal to 1 third

01:03:42.842 --> 01:03:48.559
times (1 0) 2 thirds times
(minus 1 1 half),

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:54.719
which equals 1 third - 1 third
which equals 0.

01:03:54.719 --> 01:03:58.492
So starting at this point
you've got 1 red card and 2

01:03:58.492 --> 01:03:59.510
black cards.
 

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:02.159
It looks horrible to pick a
card, 2 thirds of the time

01:04:02.159 --> 01:04:04.059
you're going to get the wrong
card,

01:04:04.059 --> 01:04:07.780
but you still have a position
that's actually equal in value,

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:12.880
because if you get that black
card which wins you stop.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.731
If you get a red card you're
now in a position that's equal

01:04:15.731 --> 01:04:17.550
deck and that's favorable for
you,

01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:20.000
because if you get another
black card you stop,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.889
and if you get a red card you
keep playing until the end.

01:04:26.889 --> 01:04:27.670
So that's it.
 

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:29.780
So how can you do this by
backward induction?

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:33.626
You have the stuff on the edges
and then you solve for all these

01:04:33.626 --> 01:04:36.858
things along the side here,
and having done that now I can

01:04:36.858 --> 01:04:39.469
solve for this one because I've
got up and to the left.

01:04:39.469 --> 01:04:42.539
Now I do that row and then I
can do this whole row,

01:04:42.539 --> 01:04:45.840
and then I can just by backward
induction do the whole thing,

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.719
and the computer does that
instantly.

01:04:47.719 --> 01:04:50.813
So it figures out the value of
every single node and it's

01:04:50.813 --> 01:04:52.469
shocking what the answer is.
 

01:04:52.469 --> 01:05:00.590
So are there any other
questions about this?

01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:03.250
Ben, do you-- so...
 

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.789
Student: Yeah,
I figured it out.

01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:07.550
I tell you initially I'm
thinking about it.

01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:13.090
Well, maybe this value is
actually an option value.

01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:17.003
For example if you choose to
play this game and after you win

01:05:17.003 --> 01:05:21.050
or you lose then you'll get an
option to continue the game,

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:24.929
and so I separated that option
value to this.

01:05:24.929 --> 01:05:25.909
Prof: Well,
that is your option.

01:05:25.909 --> 01:05:30.599
The option is always to keep
playing or to stop,

01:05:30.599 --> 01:05:33.809
but the value I wrote down is
the value of the game to you,

01:05:33.809 --> 01:05:38.730
of being able to play the whole
game however you want.

01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:42.460
So now let's do another example.
 

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.340
Yes?
 

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.536
Student: Would you call
somebody rational who doesn't

01:05:45.536 --> 01:05:47.510
play the game up to that point
that you showed me,

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:50.420
the point .05
&gt;

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.219
Prof: Right,
so if you got...

01:05:52.219 --> 01:05:55.313
Student: My question is,
is it preference to risk or is

01:05:55.313 --> 01:05:57.090
it actually the rationality
of...

01:05:57.090 --> 01:05:59.250
Prof: Right,
so this is going to become very

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:00.329
important very shortly.
 

01:06:00.329 --> 01:06:03.670
So his question is I just
proved if you can call that a

01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:06.773
proof by computer,
the computer proved that even

01:06:06.773 --> 01:06:10.820
if you got 5 blacks in a row you
should still draw another card.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.224
Of course things are quite
risky now because there's a very

01:06:14.224 --> 01:06:17.630
good chance you're going to lose
on that very next card.

01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:20.920
So he's saying if you're risk
averse maybe you would stop

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.931
there,
and how can you distinguish

01:06:22.931 --> 01:06:26.172
somebody who's risk averse from
somebody who's just dumb and

01:06:26.172 --> 01:06:27.820
can't make the calculation.
 

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:31.202
So that's going to be a
question we're going to take up

01:06:31.202 --> 01:06:32.768
in the very next class.
 

01:06:32.768 --> 01:06:36.273
But I would say that it's
usually because people are dumb

01:06:36.273 --> 01:06:38.340
and can't make the calculation.
 

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:41.657
So they just don't realize how
favorable the situation is

01:06:41.657 --> 01:06:45.570
they're in by having this option
to be able to play to the end,

01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:47.329
to stop when they want to stop.
 

01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:50.079
So let's just do one more
example.

01:06:50.079 --> 01:06:57.711
Suppose that you are
undergraduates and you want to

01:06:57.711 --> 01:06:59.849
get married.
 

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.780
You've been told that's a good
idea,

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:05.820
and you--it's going to be a
very sexist thing,

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:10.789
but anyway this is also a game
I invented which turned out not

01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:13.480
to be as original as I thought.
 

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.929
So I call this the optimal
marriage problem.

01:07:16.929 --> 01:07:23.039
So let's say you knew you were
going to meet 1,000 women.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:27.489
You're telling it from the
guy's point of view.

01:07:27.489 --> 01:07:33.034
You're going to meet 1,000
women and each woman you meet

01:07:33.034 --> 01:07:39.081
her suitability you can't tell
until you meet her and talk to

01:07:39.081 --> 01:07:44.809
her,
and after you meet her each

01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:54.630
woman's suitability is uniformly
distributed on (0,1).

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:56.079
So what do I mean by that?
 

01:07:56.079 --> 01:07:58.418
I mean you meet her,
you talk to her,

01:07:58.418 --> 01:08:01.210
you get to know her,
and before you met her,

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:04.590
you have no idea how suitable
she's going to be.

01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:06.730
After you've talked to her you
understand how suitable.

01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:07.960
The best, it's 1.
 

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.068
The worst, it's 0,
and it could be a draw anywhere

01:08:11.068 --> 01:08:12.210
between 0 and 1.
 

01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:13.719
Before you meet her you have no
idea.

01:08:13.719 --> 01:08:17.081
After you meet her you know
exactly how suitable she is,

01:08:17.081 --> 01:08:20.868
and there are going to be 1,000
of them that you could meet.

01:08:20.868 --> 01:08:28.444
The problem is that after
you've talked to a woman you can

01:08:28.444 --> 01:08:32.962
marry her then,
or you can move on,

01:08:32.962 --> 01:08:40.670
but once you've moved on you
can never go back to her.

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:42.698
So you understand the problem.
 

01:08:42.698 --> 01:08:46.810
The problem is that let's say
the first woman is .95 or .90.

01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:48.698
You think, gosh how suitable.
 

01:08:48.698 --> 01:08:52.284
This is a great match,
but I've got 999 more women to

01:08:52.284 --> 01:08:52.630
go.
 

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:56.887
Maybe I'll do better,
and then you get 0s from then

01:08:56.887 --> 01:08:59.168
on,
and so you've missed your .90,

01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:02.470
and so you're going to end up
marrying the last one who's

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:03.710
maybe a 0 for you.
 

01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:10.039
That doesn't mean she's a 0,
just for you a 0.

01:09:10.039 --> 01:09:10.828
I'm trying.
 

01:09:10.828 --> 01:09:16.349
Anyway, so what should your
optimal strategy be and are you

01:09:16.349 --> 01:09:19.300
playing the optimal strategy.
 

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:21.725
So what do you think,
just intuitively,

01:09:21.725 --> 01:09:23.640
what's the optimal strategy?
 

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.073
Of course we're going to do it
by backward induction,

01:09:26.073 --> 01:09:28.179
but what do you think it's
going to look like,

01:09:28.179 --> 01:09:29.350
the optimal strategy?
 

01:09:29.350 --> 01:09:29.738
Yes?
 

01:09:29.738 --> 01:09:31.930
Student: The further you
get into the game the less

01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:32.930
selective you should be.
 

01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:36.189
Prof: Right,
that's what's going to happen.

01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:39.672
We're going to prove this,
but he's exactly picked--he

01:09:39.672 --> 01:09:42.960
said, you set a threshold here
at the beginning.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.899
You'll marry her if she's above
some number.

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:48.069
You keep to that threshold for
a while.

01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:51.045
Then you haven't married anyone
and you'd say,

01:09:51.045 --> 01:09:54.878
oh my god, I'm running out of
women and then your standards

01:09:54.878 --> 01:09:56.069
just collapse.
 

01:09:56.069 --> 01:09:59.130
Desperation sets in.
 

01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:02.369
So that's absolutely right,
but the only interesting thing

01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:05.270
is to figure out how high the
standard should be.

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:09.260
So how high do you think it is
at the beginning?

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:13.470
What would you say the number
is at the beginning?

01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:16.180
Now, let me give you a hint.
 

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:22.211
If you divide up--here's 1 and
there's 1,000 women,

01:10:22.211 --> 01:10:23.899
so here's 0.
 

01:10:23.899 --> 01:10:25.430
So they're randomly picked.
 

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:30.137
So if you could look at all the
women, and pick out the most

01:10:30.137 --> 01:10:33.810
suitable one,
what would her suitability be?

01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:41.340
Well, her suitability would
be--so top, the top on average

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:46.890
will be something like 1,000
over 1,001.

01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:48.279
This is a famous problem.
 

01:10:48.279 --> 01:10:52.712
If you take N people randomly,
you take N numbers you pick

01:10:52.712 --> 01:10:57.176
randomly uniformly on (0,
1) the top one on average is

01:10:57.176 --> 01:11:00.060
going to be,
if there's 1,000 women it's

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:01.220
1,000 over 1,001.
 

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:06.729
Second top is going to be 999
over 1,001.

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:11.018
So this very standard
statistical result actually was

01:11:11.018 --> 01:11:15.390
derived by a former Yale
professor in World War II.

01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:18.539
The Americans captured German
tanks which had all their serial

01:11:18.539 --> 01:11:19.470
numbers on them.
 

01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:24.149
The first tank was number 1,
the second tank was number 2,

01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:26.140
the third tank they made was
number 3,

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.750
so we captured a bunch of them
and then we had to guess,

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:30.460
how many tanks did they make?
 

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:34.380
Anyhow, so it's related to this
idea that if they're uniformly

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.391
distributed on (0,
1) the top one's going to be on

01:11:37.391 --> 01:11:42.640
average 1,000 over 1,001,
999 over 1,001 etcetera.

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:47.078
So what standard would you set
for the first one?

01:11:47.078 --> 01:11:47.408
Right?
 

01:11:47.408 --> 01:11:49.439
You have to set some threshold
here.

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:52.399
Here's one and here's 0.
 

01:11:52.399 --> 01:11:55.877
By the end you'll take the last
woman you've got--you're going

01:11:55.877 --> 01:11:57.529
to take her no matter what.
 

01:11:57.529 --> 01:12:01.220
So what should the threshold be?
 

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:02.328
Well, it's hard to tell.
 

01:12:02.328 --> 01:12:04.199
We can't do it except by
backward induction.

01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:06.448
So what would you guess?
 

01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:07.420
Student: 1
&gt;

01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:09.762
Prof: 1,
well then you'll never take her

01:12:09.762 --> 01:12:12.462
if it's 1 because the odds of
getting exactly 1 are 0,

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:13.890
so what would you guess?
 

01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:15.649
Student:
&gt;

01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:19.519
Prof: So you'd set the
threshold this high,

01:12:19.519 --> 01:12:21.020
1,000 over 1,001.
 

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:24.056
So that means you're expecting
to get as good a woman as if you

01:12:24.056 --> 01:12:26.408
could go to the very end and
look at all of them,

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:27.828
you never make a mistake.
 

01:12:27.828 --> 01:12:29.890
I told you, there's a chance
you'll make a mistake.

01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:31.029
The first one's the best.
 

01:12:31.029 --> 01:12:33.695
It doesn't quite come to your
threshold and all the rest are

01:12:33.695 --> 01:12:35.729
worse then you end up with a
disaster here.

01:12:35.729 --> 01:12:40.069
So you have a chance of not
doing that well,

01:12:40.069 --> 01:12:41.819
so you're setting too high a
standard here,

01:12:41.819 --> 01:12:44.194
because you have a very good
chance of saying no to all these

01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:45.779
women and then ending up with
what's--

01:12:45.779 --> 01:12:46.488
right?
 

01:12:46.488 --> 01:12:49.279
However, you're on the right
track.

01:12:49.279 --> 01:12:52.800
So amazingly,
this is the answer,

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.439
this is the threshold.
 

01:12:55.439 --> 01:13:00.253
So you should set the threshold
at where you expect the second

01:13:00.253 --> 01:13:03.686
highest woman to be,
the second highest match to be,

01:13:03.686 --> 01:13:06.764
and that is why there's so many
novels about the other woman

01:13:06.764 --> 01:13:09.632
because if you're playing
optimally you should be ending

01:13:09.632 --> 01:13:12.658
up with the second best woman
and there should be one other

01:13:12.658 --> 01:13:15.787
woman that at the end of your
life you regret that you didn't

01:13:15.787 --> 01:13:18.590
wait for,
but only one other woman.

01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:23.465
So anyway, I just want to prove
this to you in the same way we

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:28.420
proved it before just by solving
for backward induction for the

01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:30.604
optimal--
so we can just do this by

01:13:30.604 --> 01:13:31.520
backward induction.
 

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.538
We know exactly what to do.
 

01:13:34.538 --> 01:13:36.408
It's one thing to say what you
should do.

01:13:36.408 --> 01:13:38.496
It's another thing to prove
that's what you should do and

01:13:38.496 --> 01:13:39.538
I'm going to prove it now.
 

01:13:39.538 --> 01:13:46.481
So you can just see by backward
induction how easy it is to do

01:13:46.481 --> 01:13:48.189
these things.
 

01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:49.300
I'm going to have to take four
minutes.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.868
If you can hang out for four
minutes we'll get this.

01:13:51.868 --> 01:13:55.130
So what happens with 2 women
left?

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:58.310
What's V of 2?
 

01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:59.770
What should you do?
 

01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:05.229
What should your threshold be
for 2 women?

01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:09.800
So here's the threshold.
 

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:15.520
Threshold for 1 woman is 0.
 

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.829
If it's the last woman there
whatever she is that's it.

01:14:19.829 --> 01:14:21.060
You might as well marry her.
 

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.069
It can't be negative.
 

01:14:23.069 --> 01:14:27.770
And then the value--unlike
Herodotus--

01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:30.819
the value of 1 is going to be a
half,

01:14:30.819 --> 01:14:32.850
right, because if there's 1
woman left you're going to take

01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:34.738
her no matter what and on
average you'll get a half.

01:14:34.738 --> 01:14:38.170
So the question is now,
what's the threshold when there

01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:41.408
are 2 women left and what's your
expected payoff?

01:14:41.408 --> 01:14:44.250
So what's the threshold if
there are 2 women left?

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.893
You see the second to last
woman, you talk to her,

01:14:46.893 --> 01:14:48.890
you find out how good the match
is.

01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:52.649
You should take her if the
match is above what?

01:14:52.649 --> 01:14:54.460
Student: 1 over 1,001?
 

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:58.029
Prof: No,
there's only 1 woman left after

01:14:58.029 --> 01:14:58.788
her, so.
 

01:14:58.788 --> 01:15:00.823
So a half, right,
because if you don't take her

01:15:00.823 --> 01:15:03.475
you're going to go to the last
woman and on an average you're

01:15:03.475 --> 01:15:05.878
going to get a half,
so there's no point in taking

01:15:05.878 --> 01:15:08.657
someone whose match is less than
a half when the very next step

01:15:08.657 --> 01:15:10.555
you're,
on average, you're going to get

01:15:10.555 --> 01:15:10.920
a half.
 

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.590
So your threshold is a half.
 

01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:15.260
So what's your expected quality
of the match?

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:22.658
Well, with probability a half
she's going to be above a half,

01:15:22.658 --> 01:15:26.108
and if she's above a half she's
going to be half way between 1

01:15:26.108 --> 01:15:28.710
and a half,
so it's 3 quarters.

01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:32.255
And with probability,
sorry, and with probability a

01:15:32.255 --> 01:15:36.652
half she's going to be below a
half and you're going to pass on

01:15:36.652 --> 01:15:41.050
her and go to the last one and
it'll be on average a half.

01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:45.600
So this is 3 eighths plus, no.
 

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.854
Probability a half,
she's going to be 3 quarters

01:15:48.854 --> 01:15:52.246
and probability a half,
she'll be a half so it's 3

01:15:52.246 --> 01:15:54.670
eighths 1 quarter,
is 5 eights.

01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:58.823
Now, what if there are 3 women,
what should the threshold be

01:15:58.823 --> 01:16:01.640
for 3 women and what's the value
of 3?

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.680
Student: 5 eighths.
 

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.055
Prof: So the threshold
should be V of 2,

01:16:06.055 --> 01:16:09.210
which is 5 eighths,
and what's the value?

01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:12.154
The value's going to be,
what's the chance that you take

01:16:12.154 --> 01:16:13.439
the one you just meet?
 

01:16:13.439 --> 01:16:15.625
Well, the odds that she's above
a half [correction:

01:16:15.625 --> 01:16:16.850
above V(2)]
is 3 eighths,

01:16:16.850 --> 01:16:22.770
so it's 3 eighths times the
average of 1,

01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:25.000
you know, half way between,
so he's above 5 eights,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.210
so she's somewhere between 1
and 5 eighths.

01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:31.225
So that's going to be (1 5
eighths) over 2,

01:16:31.225 --> 01:16:36.962
plus 5 eighths of the time you
pass on her and then you get 5

01:16:36.962 --> 01:16:38.109
eighths.
 

01:16:38.109 --> 01:16:46.152
So that equals,
if we just do that a little bit

01:16:46.152 --> 01:16:54.019
more generally,
it's 1 - V (2)--So that's (1 -

01:16:54.019 --> 01:17:04.159
V (2)) times (1 V (2)) divided
by 2 V (2) times V (2).

01:17:04.159 --> 01:17:06.460
So that's the formula.
 

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:11.804
So in general V (t),
you set the threshold at V

01:17:11.804 --> 01:17:12.850
-(t-1).
 

01:17:12.850 --> 01:17:19.288
So with probability V (t-1)
you're going to get (1 V (t-1))

01:17:19.288 --> 01:17:23.952
divided by 2,
and with probability 1 minus,

01:17:23.952 --> 01:17:24.729
no.
 

01:17:24.729 --> 01:17:28.282
This is 1 - V (t-1),
with probability of V (t-1)

01:17:28.282 --> 01:17:32.590
you're going to get--you're
going to pass on her and go to

01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:35.840
the next thing so you get just V
(t-1).

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.420
So that's just a formula.
 

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:40.729
V(t) equals some function of
V(t-1).

01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:43.520
So you can program that into a
computer.

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:46.439
So I'm ending now with this one
picture.

01:17:46.439 --> 01:17:47.470
That's the end of it.
 

01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:47.979
Sorry.
 

01:17:47.979 --> 01:17:49.979
I know I've gone over,
but this is the last picture.

01:17:49.979 --> 01:17:51.198
It'll only take a second.
 

01:17:51.198 --> 01:17:57.194
So 0, yield curve optimal
marriage, so here it is,

01:17:57.194 --> 01:18:02.578
with one woman your value--oh
shit, sorry.

01:18:02.578 --> 01:18:17.899
With 1 woman the value is a
half, 1 match to go.

01:18:17.899 --> 01:18:22.135
So the number on the left is
with 1 match to go the value's a

01:18:22.135 --> 01:18:26.300
half, with 2 it's 5 eighths,
with 3 we computed that too.

01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:28.618
So you can tell for however
many women you want.

01:18:28.618 --> 01:18:33.836
Now, what I've done on the
right number,

01:18:33.836 --> 01:18:37.180
is this N - 1 over N 1.
 

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:40.734
So that's the second best woman
how good she'd be on average for

01:18:40.734 --> 01:18:42.527
you,
and as you go down further and

01:18:42.527 --> 01:18:45.229
further you see these numbers
are getting to be the same.

01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:48.367
So this number and this
number's practically the same

01:18:48.367 --> 01:18:51.685
and if you go down to the very
bottom you'll see they're

01:18:51.685 --> 01:18:52.529
identical.
 

01:18:52.529 --> 01:18:57.201
Up to an incredible number of
decimal places these two numbers

01:18:57.201 --> 01:18:58.350
are the same.
 

01:18:58.350 --> 01:19:00.671
So if there are enough women
you're going to get exactly the

01:19:00.671 --> 01:19:02.916
second best, and it's going to
be the problem of the other

01:19:02.916 --> 01:19:03.310
woman.
 

01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:06.885
But anyway, the point of all
this was to just illustrate how

01:19:06.885 --> 01:19:08.399
powerful the option is.
 

01:19:08.399 --> 01:19:11.194
It's as if you could go to the
very end and pick out the second

01:19:11.194 --> 01:19:13.583
best one even though you have to
do them sequentially,

01:19:13.583 --> 01:19:13.899
so.
 

01:19:13.899 --> 01:19:19.000

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.310
Prof: Okay,
let's get started.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.637
The stuff we're doing these few
days are really the focus of the

00:00:08.637 --> 00:00:10.630
first half of the semester.
 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.360
So pay attention and think
about it.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.581
Okay, so the topics today are
Overlap and Energy-Match,

00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:25.420
as determinants of how strong
bonds are.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.100
So we'll start with overlap.
 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.862
We saw last time that overlap
is what creates the difference

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:35.937
density,
what focuses some small amount

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:40.240
of the electron density between
the atoms and serves to hold

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.480
them together.
 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.981
The overlap integral is the
total amount of that product of

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:47.930
A and B.
 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.630
Remember, you square
(A+B) and you get A^2

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.290
+ B^2 + 2AB.
 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.470
That 2AB term is the
overlap.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.820
It's called overlap because it
has values when both functions

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.736
have appreciable magnitude,
at the same point in space;

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:05.968
they overlap.
 

00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:08.986
And summing that over all
space, or integrating it,

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:11.579
gives what's called the overlap
integral.

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.828
It'll depend on the distance.
 

00:01:13.828 --> 00:01:15.790
Obviously if they're very far
apart,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.926
they don't give simultaneous
values to the same point in

00:01:18.926 --> 00:01:20.994
space,
because it's far from either

00:01:20.994 --> 00:01:23.610
one or the other,
or from both.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.980
So it depends on distance.
 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.391
It also depends on
hybridization,

00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:31.159
and that's what we're going to
talk about first.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.080
Okay, first let's just look for
scale.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.037
Here are the 2s orbitals
of carbon atom,

00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:41.479
and you can work out,
with your formulas,

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.297
that the diameter of the
spherical node is 0.7 angstroms.

00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:47.330
Right?
 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.080
That means we have a distance
scale here.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.333
Now, the distance between two
carbons is roughly 1.4,1.5,

00:01:56.333 --> 00:02:01.774
when they're forming a bond
from one another -- between one

00:02:01.774 --> 00:02:02.900
another.
 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.688
Okay.
 

00:02:03.688 --> 00:02:07.271
So that means we can use that
0.7 angstrom scale to see how

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:10.729
far we have to slide these
together, in order to get them

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.150
to bonded distance.
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.179
If we superimposed the X's --
remember those diameters are

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.110
each 0.7 --
so if we slide them together

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.961
until we superimpose the X's,
then they're 1.4 angstroms

00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:24.870
apart.
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.157
So that's about the distance
that these two orbitals are,

00:02:28.157 --> 00:02:31.151
in the proper scale,
when they're in a carbon-carbon

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:31.680
bond.
 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.199
Now, how big is the overlap
integral, the sum of the product

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:43.150
of A times B,
over all space?

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.910
Now I want you to guess,
guess how big that integral is.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.538
And we have a hint.
 

00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:53.825
What would the overlap integral
be if we moved them until they

00:02:53.825 --> 00:02:57.120
superimposed on one another
exactly?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.438
That's the maximum we could
get, if the distance were zero.

00:03:00.438 --> 00:03:04.266
So if pulled them all together,
then A and B would be measured

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:05.710
from the same center.
 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.599
So it would be the same thing
as A^2.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.038
Okay?
 

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:14.050
So what would the integral of
A^2^( )be, over all space?

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.128
Student:  One.
 

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:17.800
Prof: One;
that's normalization.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.366
Okay, so the maximum value you
can get when they're right on

00:03:21.366 --> 00:03:24.752
top of one another -- negatives
multiply negatives to get

00:03:24.752 --> 00:03:26.468
positive;
positive areas,

00:03:26.468 --> 00:03:29.008
multiply positive areas to get
positive.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.520
Everything is optimum,
is going to be one.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.228
Now I want somebody to give me
an idea, a guess,

00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:37.051
of how big it's going to be
here, or at least some

00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:39.530
considerations that would go
into that.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.940
The maximum value you can get
is one.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.520
How big do you think it would
be here?

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.848
What's something that would
hurt it;

00:03:49.848 --> 00:03:51.592
that is, make it less than one?
 

00:03:51.592 --> 00:03:52.098
Russell?
 

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:53.872
Student:  When there's
very little overlap on the

00:03:53.872 --> 00:03:54.419
opposite sides.
 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.092
Prof: Yeah,
out beyond the red areas,

00:03:57.092 --> 00:03:59.639
there's very little overlap
altogether.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.855
So you lose whatever overlap
you'd get from there,

00:04:02.855 --> 00:04:04.758
in doing the normalization.
 

00:04:04.758 --> 00:04:07.061
Now, in the middle,
right in the middle,

00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:08.889
you have blue on top of blue.
 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.419
That's good.
 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.914
But notice there's also a node
that's going to interfere with

00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:16.420
some of the wave functions'
overlapping,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.851
and there's going to be a
little bit of blue on top of

00:04:19.851 --> 00:04:20.240
red.
 

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.180
Everybody got that?
 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.759
So I just want people to guess.
 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:25.970
Okay, I know what I'll do.
 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.350
We'll do a poll.
 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.257
This is a democracy after all;
we're about to get into

00:04:30.257 --> 00:04:30.810
November.
 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.673
So I'm going to start with 0.1,
as what you think it would be.

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:35.180
Right?
 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.733
The maximum,
if you put them right on top of

00:04:36.733 --> 00:04:37.529
one another, is one.
 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:41.009
So I'm going to start with 0.1,
and move up and see hands.

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.500
Okay, how many people think
it's 0.1?

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.069
0.2?
 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.110
0.3?
 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.319
0.4?
 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.269
0.5?
 

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:54.930
0.6?
 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.350
7,8, 9, one?
 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.180
Obviously not one.
 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.644
Now, I think,
my sense of this is it peaked

00:05:03.644 --> 00:05:07.690
between 0.3 and 0.4,
but there were some votes for

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.680
0.2, and I would've voted for
0.2,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.139
because it looks like you've
lost an awful lot here.

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.829
But in fact I personally am
surprised that it's pretty big.

00:05:15.829 --> 00:05:17.689
It's 0.41.
 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:20.625
It's almost half as big as it
would be if they were right on

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:23.541
top of one another,
despite the fact that you're

00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:26.867
losing great parts of it,
that they don't overlap at all,

00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:29.750
and there's negative overlap
where red's on top of blue.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.019
Still the fact is it's 0.41;
so pretty big.

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:35.951
Now that's going to depend on
distance obviously.

00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:36.440
Right?
 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.209
So here's how it depends on
distance.

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:43.329
There's that point;
at 1.4 angstroms it's 0.41.

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:46.178
And I've put on here for
reference the distance of a

00:05:46.178 --> 00:05:49.307
carbon-carbon single bond,
the distance of a carbon-carbon

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:52.029
double bond,
and a carbon-carbon triple bond.

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:54.646
And zero, notice,
would be way down,

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.815
out in the hallway someplace.
 

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:57.490
Right?
 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.108
We're only looking at the
region that's carbon-carbon

00:06:01.108 --> 00:06:04.379
bonds -- or maybe just about to
the far wall.

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:05.250
Okay?
 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.072
Here's half an angstrom;
we got to go two more halves.

00:06:09.072 --> 00:06:09.670
Right?
 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.644
Okay, so here's how -- how do
you think -- what should the

00:06:13.644 --> 00:06:14.829
line look like?
 

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:16.920
Should it be sine wave?
 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.680
Should it be increasing as we
go to the left?

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.389
Should it be decreasing as we
go to the left?

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:27.209
What do you think?
 

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:28.300
Some guess.
 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.540
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.509
Prof: Should probably
decrease.

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.475
Because we know it's going to
approach one.

00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:34.040
Right?
 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.959
And there it is.
 

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:38.079
Yes, it decreases -- pardon me,
it increases as you go to the

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:41.355
left, and ultimately it'll go up
to one, when you get out to the

00:06:41.355 --> 00:06:41.980
hallway.
 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.029
Okay?
 

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.230
So that's s with
s.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.060
Now let's look at some other
orbitals that might overlap,

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.639
and see how big their overlap
integrals would be.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:55.033
Okay, suppose you have s
on one, overlapping with

00:06:55.033 --> 00:06:56.949
p on the other.
 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.550
Now that p is called,
for this purpose,

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.360
π.
 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.019
p is the Greek version of
p;

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:09.814
in fact, in Greek you pronounce
it 'pee,' not 'pie'.

00:07:09.814 --> 00:07:10.410
Right?
 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.709
So that's the Greek letter
p.

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:14.709
Am I right about that?
 

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:16.920
Student:  It depends on
classical or modern Greek.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.189
Prof: Okay,
which way is it?

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.689
Student:  It'd be 'pee'
in modern Greek;

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:23.240
it'd be 'pie' in classical.
 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.529
Prof: Uh-huh, okay, good.
 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:26.560
So anyhow, ‘pie'.
 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.399
&gt;
 

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:31.495
Prof: Now,
so that symbol is used to talk

00:07:31.495 --> 00:07:36.639
about molecular orbitals,
or parts of molecular orbitals;

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.310
where p is used to talk
about atomic orbitals.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.029
They correspond to one another.
 

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:44.920
Now what is it that
characterizes a p atomic

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.699
orbital?
 

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:47.310
Has a nodal plane.
 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.428
And in the same way a
π orbital has a nodal

00:07:51.428 --> 00:07:55.466
plane that contains the nuclei
that are in question.

00:07:55.466 --> 00:07:56.259
Right?
 

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:59.208
So you see, if those two came
together there'd be a nodal

00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:02.050
plane in the orbital on the
right that contains the two

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:02.629
nuclei.
 

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:03.209
Okay?
 

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:05.430
So that's called a π
orbital.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.180
Okay?
 

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.560
Now, but notice the
contributions to the overlap.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.079
Below that plane,
you're going to have blue

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:15.088
overlapping with blue.
 

00:08:15.088 --> 00:08:17.459
So that's going to be a
positive contribution.

00:08:17.459 --> 00:08:20.339
But above, you're going to have
blue overlapping with red;

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:22.665
that's going to be a negative
contribution,

00:08:22.665 --> 00:08:23.939
and it's symmetrical.
 

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:27.810
So what will the total be?
 

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.019
What will the total overlap
integral be;

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:32.230
the sum of all the overlaps?
 

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.620
Student:  One.
 

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.379
Prof: One?
 

00:08:35.379 --> 00:08:37.220
Prof: It'll be zero,
because for every contribution

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.582
on the bottom that's positive,
there'll be one on the top

00:08:39.582 --> 00:08:41.450
that's the same value and is
negative.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.308
So it's going to be zero.
 

00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:47.269
So the one on the left is
called σ.

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:50.562
Now σ is the Greek
equivalence of 's.'

00:08:50.562 --> 00:08:51.090
Right?
 

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.096
So it means,
for a molecular orbital,

00:08:53.096 --> 00:08:55.548
what s meant for an
atomic orbital;

00:08:55.548 --> 00:08:58.639
there are no nodes that contain
the nucleus.

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:02.259
Okay?
 

00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:05.077
Okay, so if you have
σ overlapping with

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.178
a π,
there's going to be this

00:09:07.178 --> 00:09:09.389
symmetry that causes a
cancellation.

00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:12.441
So you can never get any
overlap, by overlapping a

00:09:12.441 --> 00:09:15.678
σ orbital with a
π orbital.

00:09:15.678 --> 00:09:18.730
Does that make sense to
everyone?

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.769
It does make sense,
doesn't make sense?

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:24.500
If you have one that doesn't
have a horizontal node,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.490
that's the same top and bottom,
and one that does have a node

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.302
that's plus on the top,
minus on the bottom,

00:09:31.302 --> 00:09:34.169
then you're going to get this
cancellation everywhere,

00:09:34.169 --> 00:09:34.820
and zero.
 

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.139
And that's called
‘orthogonal'.

00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:41.779
Okay, so you won't get any net
interaction there.

00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:44.898
Okay, but if you turn the
p orbital so that it is

00:09:44.898 --> 00:09:48.315
also σ --
notice it has a plane,

00:09:48.315 --> 00:09:51.635
a nodal plane,
that contains that nucleus,

00:09:51.635 --> 00:09:55.494
but it doesn't contain the
other nucleus you're interested

00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:55.899
in.
 

00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:59.659
So to call σ and
π, we need a plane

00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:01.970
that contains both
nuclei.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.360
That'll create this symmetry
that cancels things out.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.340
Okay, so this one will give
overlap.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.263
Now what would you expect for
the trend of this one,

00:10:11.263 --> 00:10:14.129
as you go from great distance
to small distance?

00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:15.897
If they're very,
very far apart,

00:10:15.897 --> 00:10:18.120
how big will the overlap
integral be;

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.990
like ten meters apart?
 

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.389
Student:  Zero.
 

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:22.230
Prof: Zero. Okay?
 

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.418
Now, as you bring it together,
as they start coming together,

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:29.490
will you get positive or
negative overlap?

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:30.190
Students:  Positive.
 

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.273
Prof: Positive;
right, the blue will overlap

00:10:32.273 --> 00:10:32.940
with the blue.
 

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.059
And you keep coming,
it'll get bigger and bigger.

00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:38.700
And then what will happen?
 

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.908
Prof: Then the red is
going to start coming in and --

00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:44.450
well the blue is going to
start, the blue on the right,

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.668
from the p orbital,
will start --

00:10:45.668 --> 00:10:50.090
and going to overlap that red
part on the left.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.451
And then, as it slides on over,
till they get exactly on top of

00:10:53.451 --> 00:10:56.595
one another -- when they get
exactly on top of one another,

00:10:56.595 --> 00:10:57.679
what will it be?
 

00:10:57.679 --> 00:10:58.529
Students:  Zero.
 

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:00.532
Prof: Zero,
because it'll be canceling

00:11:00.532 --> 00:11:01.259
right to left.
 

00:11:01.259 --> 00:11:04.341
Okay, so here's a plot of that,
for s-p

00:11:04.341 --> 00:11:06.331
σ_ overlap.
 

00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:06.908
Right?
 

00:11:06.908 --> 00:11:09.470
It's almost the same as
s with s.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.288
In fact, it's a little bigger
at great distance,

00:11:12.288 --> 00:11:14.509
a little smaller at small
distance;

00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:18.590
except, at very small distance
what will happen?

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:19.860
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.909
Prof: When you approach
zero?

00:11:23.909 --> 00:11:25.298
It'll go to zero.
 

00:11:25.298 --> 00:11:27.215
Whereas the other one went to
one.

00:11:27.215 --> 00:11:27.678
Right?
 

00:11:27.678 --> 00:11:29.440
The s with s went
to one.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.751
So, but in the region we're
interested in,

00:11:31.751 --> 00:11:34.908
the carbon-carbon bond
distances, it's about the same.

00:11:34.908 --> 00:11:39.452
Okay, now how about
p_σ with

00:11:39.452 --> 00:11:41.610
p_σ?
 

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.720
Well we won't go through an
elaborate guessing game.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.090
If they're very far apart it'll
be zero.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:51.879
How about if they were on top
of one another?

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:55.019
It's obviously going to grow as
blue gets on top of blue,

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:57.154
and then as they get really
close, the blue up from the

00:11:57.154 --> 00:12:00.628
right will be on top of the red,
and the red on top of the blue.

00:12:00.628 --> 00:12:01.100
Right?
 

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.200
So what will it approach?
 

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.169
Zack, what do you say?
 

00:12:04.169 --> 00:12:05.210
Student:  Zero.
 

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.428
Prof: Approach zero?
 

00:12:06.428 --> 00:12:12.440
What will it be when they're
right on top of one another?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.909
So red on blue here;
blue on red here.

00:12:16.909 --> 00:12:18.610
Will the overlap be zero?
 

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.320
Student:  Negative one.
 

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.490
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.548
Student:  Negative one.
 

00:12:22.548 --> 00:12:24.740
Prof: It'll be minus
one,

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.399
because it would be like the
orbital on top of itself --

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:31.070
that would be one -- except
you've changed the sign,

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.250
of one of them. Right?
 

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.259
So every contribution will be
negative.

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:38.221
So that one starts there,
and it's heading toward minus

00:12:38.221 --> 00:12:38.549
one.
 

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:42.509
So it's going down.
 

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:43.038
Okay?
 

00:12:43.038 --> 00:12:44.879
So that's p_σ with
p_σ.

00:12:44.879 --> 00:12:47.000
Can you think of any other way
we should talk about it?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.690
We've talked about s
with s.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.613
We saw that s with
p_π_ was

00:12:51.613 --> 00:12:53.525
orthogonal;
s with

00:12:53.525 --> 00:12:57.668
p_σ_
we've got there;

00:12:57.668 --> 00:12:59.029
p_σ with
p_σ.

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:01.379
Any others we need to think
about?

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:02.692
Student: 
p_σ with

00:13:02.692 --> 00:13:03.259
p_π?
 

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:07.024
Prof: How about
p_σ_ with

00:13:07.024 --> 00:13:08.139
p_π?
 

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:13.970
Can anybody guess that one?
 

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.515
P_σ_ is
the same sign,

00:13:16.515 --> 00:13:19.417
top and bottom;
p_π_ is

00:13:19.417 --> 00:13:21.690
opposite signs,
top and bottom.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:22.350
Student:  So it's zero.
 

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.299
Prof: That's going to be
zero.

00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:24.668
There'll be orthogonal.
 

00:13:24.668 --> 00:13:26.600
So have we done it now,
or is there anything else to

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.129
think about?
 

00:13:27.129 --> 00:13:28.120
Student:  π,
π.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.908
Prof: We could do
p_π with

00:13:29.908 --> 00:13:30.590
p_π.
 

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.350
Okay, so there's p_π
with p_π.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.379
Okay?
 

00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:37.700
Now at great distance they'll
be nothing.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.620
We'll bring them together,
they'll begin to overlap.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.759
What will it approach as we go
to zero?

00:13:41.759 --> 00:13:42.590
Student:  Zero.
 

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:43.860
Prof: Zero?
 

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.947
If they're on top of one
another, the product will be

00:13:45.947 --> 00:13:46.230
zero?
 

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.399
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:48.288
Prof: It'll be one,
right?

00:13:48.288 --> 00:13:51.570
It'll be the orbital with
itself, normalized.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.149
So that'll be one. Right?
 

00:13:54.149 --> 00:13:56.600
But now which do you think is
going to be bigger,

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.070
p_σ_
with

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.394
p_σ,_ or
p_π with

00:14:00.394 --> 00:14:01.250
p_π?
 

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.860
Any guesses?
 

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.397
Well, I'll give you the answer.
 

00:14:05.397 --> 00:14:05.970
Right?
 

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.500
p_π with
p_π is approaching

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:08.830
one.
 

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.861
At big distance,
it's smaller than

00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:11.784
σ.
 

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:12.340
Right?
 

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.144
But at small distance,
it must get much bigger,

00:14:15.144 --> 00:14:17.279
and in this region it's
crossing;

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:18.590
so it's bigger.
 

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:25.493
Okay, so there are the kinds of
overlaps of simple 2p

00:14:25.493 --> 00:14:26.779
orbitals.
 

00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:28.889
Now, there's a curiosity here.
 

00:14:28.889 --> 00:14:32.320
Over most of this range,
more than half of the range,

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.914
2s overlaps with
2p_σ_

00:14:34.914 --> 00:14:38.259
better than either
2s with 2s or

00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:41.490
2p_σ_
with 2p_σ.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.139
That just seems curious to me.
 

00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:46.370
You'd think that one of them
would have a shape that gives

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.220
better overlap.
 

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:47.730
Right?
 

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.700
So two of those together would
do the best job.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.379
But it's not that way.
 

00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:56.083
It's that an s with a
p is the best,

00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:58.048
over most of this range.
 

00:14:58.048 --> 00:15:00.918
I just think that's curious,
and it has an important

00:15:00.918 --> 00:15:03.278
implication, which you'll see
right now.

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:06.942
What if we use hybrid orbitals,
that are partly s and

00:15:06.942 --> 00:15:08.058
partly p?
 

00:15:08.058 --> 00:15:11.236
Now, since this one is partly
s, it's s plus a

00:15:11.236 --> 00:15:12.798
certain amount of p.
 

00:15:12.798 --> 00:15:14.830
This one's s with a
certain amount of p.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.778
The overlap will be s
here with s here;

00:15:17.778 --> 00:15:20.730
s here with p
here;

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.889
s here with p
here;

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:24.427
and p here with p
here.

00:15:24.427 --> 00:15:24.769
Right?
 

00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:28.440
There'll be four contributions:
s with s;

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.621
p with p;
s with p;

00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:31.712
p with s.
 

00:15:31.712 --> 00:15:32.139
Right?
 

00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:36.395
So if we took sp^3,
for example -- and we can make,

00:15:36.395 --> 00:15:40.279
remember, four such orbitals --
then you get that.

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:44.171
It's better than any of the
pure hybrids.

00:15:44.171 --> 00:15:44.950
Right?
 

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.832
And the reason is that it has
s with s,

00:15:48.832 --> 00:15:52.982
and p with p;
and also s with

00:15:52.982 --> 00:15:56.860
p, that comes in as a
bonus, twice.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.629
Okay, now how about if we use,
instead of sp^3,

00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:03.048
how about if we use
sp^2?

00:16:03.048 --> 00:16:06.620
Remember what happens as we
approach sp?

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.639
The orbitals extend more.
 

00:16:09.639 --> 00:16:10.919
So what do you expect?
 

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:12.340
Student:  More overlap.
 

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.528
Prof: More overlap.
 

00:16:15.528 --> 00:16:19.190
So there's sp^2 with
sp^2, a little better.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.049
How about sp with
sp?

00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:25.070
Better still.
 

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.798
Could we get any better?
 

00:16:26.798 --> 00:16:30.577
How about s^2p with
s^2p, or

00:16:30.577 --> 00:16:34.447
sp^½ with
sp^½?

00:16:34.447 --> 00:16:35.370
Right?
 

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:39.740
It's a little better at short
distance, and a little not so

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.548
good at long distance.
 

00:16:41.548 --> 00:16:45.139
So it optimizes around
sp hybridization.

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:46.379
That gives the best overlap.
 

00:16:46.379 --> 00:16:50.470
Why do we think now you want
good overlap?

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.769
Why would it be good to have
good overlap?

00:16:52.769 --> 00:16:53.658
Student:  Keep the bonds
strong.

00:16:53.658 --> 00:16:55.830
Prof: Because that's
what's building up the

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.557
difference density,
as we saw last time.

00:16:57.557 --> 00:16:58.000
Right?
 

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.538
That's putting the glue in the
orbital.

00:17:01.538 --> 00:17:05.712
Okay, so there's an interesting
observation here,

00:17:05.712 --> 00:17:10.670
that hybrids overlap about
twice as well as pure orbitals.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.538
Right?
 

00:17:11.538 --> 00:17:17.109
All the hybrids are roughly
twice as good as the pure ones.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:18.058
Okay?
 

00:17:18.058 --> 00:17:20.715
And they're not very,
very different from one

00:17:20.715 --> 00:17:21.318
another.
 

00:17:21.318 --> 00:17:25.278
But sp is about the
best, over much of this range.

00:17:25.278 --> 00:17:28.630
The trouble with sp is
you can only make two of them,

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.980
because each involves 50% of
s, and you only have one

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.798
s to go in it;
you have one s and three

00:17:34.798 --> 00:17:35.338
p's.
 

00:17:35.338 --> 00:17:38.606
So if you want to make just one
orbital, fine,

00:17:38.606 --> 00:17:41.874
use sp,
because you'll get good -- only

00:17:41.874 --> 00:17:45.915
one bond from the carbon;
fine use sp and get the

00:17:45.915 --> 00:17:46.818
best overlap.
 

00:17:46.818 --> 00:17:50.588
Or maybe even s^2p,
depending on the distance.

00:17:50.588 --> 00:17:51.170
Right?
 

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.336
But if you want to make more
bonds, more than two bonds,

00:17:54.336 --> 00:17:57.790
then you're going to have to
cut back on the s in each

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:58.308
bond.
 

00:17:58.308 --> 00:18:02.914
Because you only have 100% to
use, you can't use more than 50%

00:18:02.914 --> 00:18:05.859
in more than two bonds you're
making.

00:18:05.859 --> 00:18:06.358
Okay.
 

00:18:06.358 --> 00:18:09.428
And what you see here is that
sp^3^( )isn't much worse

00:18:09.428 --> 00:18:10.400
than sp^2.
 

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.906
So why not make four -- right?
 

00:18:12.906 --> 00:18:14.578
-- because you can.
 

00:18:14.578 --> 00:18:18.506
Okay, anyhow,
that's the hybridization of

00:18:18.506 --> 00:18:19.390
carbon.
 

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.298
So, and the reason they do
this, as I already said,

00:18:22.298 --> 00:18:25.623
is because they allow nearly
full measure of s with

00:18:25.623 --> 00:18:28.375
p overlap,
plus s with s,

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:31.880
and p with p,
when you have mixtures.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.853
So that all depends on the fact
that s-p_σ

00:18:35.853 --> 00:18:38.220
is so good in its overlap.
 

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.414
Now, so sp gives the
best overlap,

00:18:41.414 --> 00:18:45.328
but only allows two orbitals,
with 50% in each;

00:18:45.328 --> 00:18:48.619
sp^3 gives four,
and nearly as much overlap.

00:18:48.619 --> 00:18:49.868
Okay?
 

00:18:49.868 --> 00:18:52.990
Now we're going to look at the
influence of overlap on

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.578
molecular orbital energy.
 

00:18:54.578 --> 00:18:56.894
But we're going to use Erwin
Meets Goldilocks,

00:18:56.894 --> 00:18:57.920
just for familiarity.
 

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.352
So we're working here in just
one-dimension,

00:19:00.352 --> 00:19:01.710
to get the idea of it.
 

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:07.308
And we'll also then think in
more general terms.

00:19:07.308 --> 00:19:11.338
And we've already done this,
so it's partly review.

00:19:11.338 --> 00:19:13.930
So we'll assume that there's
perfect energy match;

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.240
that is, the two atoms we're
talking about.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.986
Of course, atoms would be
Coulombic potentials,

00:19:18.986 --> 00:19:21.791
not harmonic oscillator,
Hooke's Law potentials.

00:19:21.791 --> 00:19:22.390
Right?
 

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.880
But the idea of a
double-minimum is the same.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.759
So we'll suppose that the atoms
are equivalent.

00:19:27.759 --> 00:19:31.579
So the bottom of the well is
the same on both sides.

00:19:31.579 --> 00:19:33.009
And guess an energy.
 

00:19:33.009 --> 00:19:36.681
And lo and behold we were right;
we got the solution,

00:19:36.681 --> 00:19:38.490
and you've seen that one.
 

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:38.950
Okay?
 

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.086
But you can also get that one,
one with one node.

00:19:42.086 --> 00:19:42.608
Right?
 

00:19:42.608 --> 00:19:45.363
And on the far left you can see
that they have the same

00:19:45.363 --> 00:19:46.740
curvature-over-amplitude.
 

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.930
So they have essentially the
same energy.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.635
If the green energy is right,
the red energy is the same

00:19:52.635 --> 00:19:52.972
deal.
 

00:19:52.972 --> 00:19:53.578
Right?
 

00:19:53.578 --> 00:19:57.839
They're ‘degenerate'
orbitals, because they're far

00:19:57.839 --> 00:19:58.460
apart.
 

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:58.970
Okay?
 

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.230
No significant energy
difference.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.348
Now, suppose we increase the
overlap.

00:20:04.348 --> 00:20:06.970
What will happen if we shorten
the distance?

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.371
You did this on a problem set
with Erwin.

00:20:09.371 --> 00:20:09.778
Right?
 

00:20:09.778 --> 00:20:13.080
So you bring them closer
together, and you have the one

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.710
with no nodes,
and the one with one node.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:19.278
And now there's a little --
right halfway between there's

00:20:19.278 --> 00:20:22.781
more electron density in one
than there is in the other.

00:20:22.781 --> 00:20:23.420
Right?
 

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.363
The antibonding one has zero
and the bonding one has some

00:20:27.363 --> 00:20:30.250
buildup of electron density in
between.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:34.997
But the energy hasn't changed
visibly on this scale that we're

00:20:34.997 --> 00:20:35.619
using.
 

00:20:35.619 --> 00:20:37.680
It looks just the same.
 

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.788
Okay?
 

00:20:38.788 --> 00:20:41.691
Now we increase it more and now
there's a big difference in the

00:20:41.691 --> 00:20:42.018
middle.
 

00:20:42.018 --> 00:20:42.440
Right?
 

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.430
And now the energies are
beginning to change.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:49.075
The unfavorable orbital is
going up and the favorable

00:20:49.075 --> 00:20:52.019
bonding orbital is going down in
energy.

00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:56.202
And if we get it still closer
together, we can see that

00:20:56.202 --> 00:20:59.609
there's now a big difference
between them.

00:20:59.609 --> 00:21:01.348
Okay?
 

00:21:01.348 --> 00:21:06.065
So that increasing overlap
creates the splitting that we

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:07.180
talk about.
 

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.258
This is just review,
as you know,

00:21:09.258 --> 00:21:12.634
but it's worth -- it's so
important that it's good to

00:21:12.634 --> 00:21:14.000
mention it again.
 

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.808
Now that overlap holds the
atoms together.

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:20.499
And this again is a picture we
saw before, except we're going

00:21:20.499 --> 00:21:23.019
to do it with writing-in the
equations.

00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:28.058
Remember, a good guess of the
form of the molecular orbital is

00:21:28.058 --> 00:21:32.519
1/√2 (A+B),
or 1/√2 (A-B).

00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:36.509
And that will give two new
orbitals, one better and one

00:21:36.509 --> 00:21:37.098
worse.
 

00:21:37.098 --> 00:21:39.753
And, in fact,
if you think about

00:21:39.753 --> 00:21:42.819
normalization,
it should be a little less than

00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:45.738
1/√2,
in the one that's going to have

00:21:45.738 --> 00:21:48.029
+2AB in it,
when you square it,

00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:50.817
and a little less than
1/√2 when it's

00:21:50.817 --> 00:21:53.890
going to have a minus sign for
the 2AB term.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.000
Okay?
 

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.275
Now, because of that ‘a
little bit greater' and ‘a

00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:00.998
little bit less',
the energies aren't quite,

00:22:00.998 --> 00:22:05.038
as we saw them before,
equally split, up and down.

00:22:05.038 --> 00:22:07.358
The one that goes down doesn't
go down quite as much,

00:22:07.358 --> 00:22:10.358
because this is less than,
and the one that goes up,

00:22:10.358 --> 00:22:12.868
goes up a little more because
it's greater than.

00:22:12.868 --> 00:22:18.482
The mathematical requirement
for that isn't immediately

00:22:18.482 --> 00:22:21.808
obvious to you,
but it's true.

00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:24.776
Okay, so there are the new
orbitals you get when you bring

00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:25.869
the atoms together.
 

00:22:25.869 --> 00:22:27.150
Okay?
 

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.480
And if you had more overlap,
there'd be a bigger difference.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.410
So that's why overlap is
important.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.088
The more overlap,
the more splitting.

00:22:34.088 --> 00:22:36.976
We just saw that in
one-dimension with Erwin

00:22:36.976 --> 00:22:38.420
Meets Goldilocks.
 

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.348
Now, how many electrons do we
have to put in these orbitals?

00:22:42.348 --> 00:22:44.250
That's going to make a big
difference.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:47.190
So suppose we have just one
electron for these two orbitals.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:50.909
When we bring the two wells
together, when we bring the two

00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:53.730
atoms together,
that electron will go down in

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.359
energy, to the new molecular
orbital.

00:22:56.359 --> 00:22:57.848
So that's going to be good.
 

00:22:57.848 --> 00:22:59.220
And if we tried to pull them
apart,

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.200
the electron would have to go
back up in energy,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.357
and that would require energy,
and that would oppose the

00:23:05.357 --> 00:23:06.190
breaking.
 

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.758
So that's the bond strength.
 

00:23:07.758 --> 00:23:08.150
Right?
 

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.170
You have to put an electron up
that much.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.858
Now suppose there were two
electrons.

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:14.900
Now a second one goes down the
same way.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.210
So it's even stronger.
 

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:21.339
It won't, in truth,
be quite twice as strong.

00:23:21.339 --> 00:23:24.430
Do you see why?
 

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:25.068
Yes?
 

00:23:25.068 --> 00:23:25.950
Student:  Electron
repulsion.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.423
Prof: Because the
electrons will repel one

00:23:27.423 --> 00:23:27.730
another.
 

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.945
We haven't taken that into
account when we think about the

00:23:30.945 --> 00:23:31.848
energies here.
 

00:23:31.848 --> 00:23:35.380
But it'll be certainly
stronger, considerably stronger.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.380
Okay.
 

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.529
Now suppose we had three
electrons.

00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:43.558
What's going to happen?
 

00:23:43.558 --> 00:23:46.537
Prof: One of them is
going to have to go up instead

00:23:46.537 --> 00:23:47.058
of down.
 

00:23:47.058 --> 00:23:50.222
And, in fact,
it will go up further than

00:23:50.222 --> 00:23:54.683
either of the others went down,
even neglecting electron

00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:56.548
repulsion -- right?
 

00:23:56.548 --> 00:23:58.984
-- because of that
‘greater than/less than'

00:23:58.984 --> 00:24:01.319
thing that shifted the pair up a
little bit.

00:24:01.319 --> 00:24:01.980
Okay?
 

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.478
So that's going to be even
weaker than having one electron

00:24:05.478 --> 00:24:08.240
to hold them together,
when you have three.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.230
How about if you have four?
 

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.109
Student:  No more bonds.
 

00:24:13.109 --> 00:24:13.769
Prof: Wilson?
 

00:24:13.769 --> 00:24:15.078
Student:  They'll be
antibonding, so --

00:24:15.078 --> 00:24:17.723
Prof: Yeah,
you're now definitely losing,

00:24:17.723 --> 00:24:20.987
because the two that go up,
go up more than the two that go

00:24:20.987 --> 00:24:22.000
down, go down.
 

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.950
So that's bad.
 

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.480
So we can summarize that here,
the effect on the bond.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.588
If you have one electron,
it's bonding;

00:24:27.588 --> 00:24:29.440
two electrons is strongly
bonding;

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.828
three electrons is weakly
bonding, probably;

00:24:32.828 --> 00:24:35.750
and four electrons will
definitely be antibonding.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.808
So that's why helium bounces
off helium,

00:24:38.808 --> 00:24:41.618
until it gets fifty-two
angstroms apart,

00:24:41.618 --> 00:24:45.410
and then there's this very,
very, very weak bond,

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.381
that we talked about,
due to the correlation of the

00:24:48.381 --> 00:24:48.974
electrons.
 

00:24:48.974 --> 00:24:49.509
Right?
 

00:24:49.509 --> 00:24:53.450
But as soon as you get overlap
with helium, it's repulsive,

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.098
when you start to split these
levels.

00:24:56.098 --> 00:25:00.098
Okay, now let's look at the
other end.

00:25:00.098 --> 00:25:03.919
Why doesn't increasing overlap,
as you bring things closer

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:08.140
together, why doesn't that make
these plum-puddings collapse?

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.910
The electrons are getting more
and more stable as you increase

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.940
the overlap by bringing things
closer together.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:22.670
So why doesn't it just collapse?
 

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:28.055
In fact, the electron -- if a
hydrogen molecule collapsed to

00:25:28.055 --> 00:25:30.317
helium --
it would be a funny helium

00:25:30.317 --> 00:25:32.108
because it would have no
neutrons --

00:25:32.108 --> 00:25:34.038
but if it collapsed,
the electrons,

00:25:34.038 --> 00:25:37.880
indeed, would become 55% more
stable.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.117
The electrons in helium are
lower in energy than the

00:25:42.117 --> 00:25:43.530
electrons in H_2.
 

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:44.279
Right?
 

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:47.239
So that would tend to pull them
together, all the way,

00:25:47.239 --> 00:25:48.299
to distance zero.
 

00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:50.730
Why don't they?
 

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:51.400
Elizabeth?
 

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.298
Student:  The protons
repel.

00:25:52.298 --> 00:25:54.259
Prof: Because the
protons will repel one another.

00:25:54.259 --> 00:25:56.339
That depends on 1/r.
 

00:25:56.339 --> 00:25:56.880
Right?
 

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.578
And that increases much more
dramatically.

00:25:59.578 --> 00:26:04.343
In fact, the amount by which
the electrons become more stable

00:26:04.343 --> 00:26:07.915
is 650 kcal/mole,
or would become more stable.

00:26:07.915 --> 00:26:08.710
Right?
 

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:13.195
But the nuclear repulsion
increases by that much by the

00:26:13.195 --> 00:26:18.265
time they get to 0.3 angstroms,
let alone the last little bit,

00:26:18.265 --> 00:26:21.089
when 1/r gets enormous.
 

00:26:21.089 --> 00:26:21.619
Okay?
 

00:26:21.619 --> 00:26:25.003
So it's not worth it;
unless you have glue to hold

00:26:25.003 --> 00:26:26.444
the neutrons together.
 

00:26:26.444 --> 00:26:26.970
Right?
 

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:31.118
So on the sun you can take
deuterium and fuse it into --

00:26:31.118 --> 00:26:33.667
to make a helium -- you have
neutrons there to hold the

00:26:33.667 --> 00:26:36.532
protons together --
and then you get 200 million

00:26:36.532 --> 00:26:38.327
kcal/mole;
which is, of course,

00:26:38.327 --> 00:26:40.390
nuclear energy,
not electronic energy.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.423
It is possible,
but not under the chemical

00:26:43.423 --> 00:26:46.460
circumstances that we're talking
about.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.730
Okay, so here's the Morse
potential.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:51.118
Yes, Lucas?
 

00:26:51.118 --> 00:26:54.325
Student:  Have we been
taking proton-proton repulsion

00:26:54.325 --> 00:26:56.769
into account before,
with all our energies?

00:26:56.769 --> 00:27:00.971
Prof: No,
or only sort of subliminally.

00:27:00.971 --> 00:27:01.720
Right?
 

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.118
Because if you take -- at first
glance there's going to be

00:27:05.118 --> 00:27:07.922
nuclear-nuclear repulsion,
and electron-electron

00:27:07.922 --> 00:27:12.119
repulsion, between the atoms;
nuclear-electron attraction;

00:27:12.119 --> 00:27:13.740
nuclear-electron attraction.
 

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.998
So to first approximation,
those will all cancel out.

00:27:16.998 --> 00:27:17.500
Right?
 

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.348
But then you get -- on top of
that you have a little change

00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:24.336
from the fact that the
nuclear-nuclear goes as

00:27:24.336 --> 00:27:27.933
1/r and gets quite big,
when they get really close,

00:27:27.933 --> 00:27:30.720
and that the electrons are
coming down because of overlap.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.396
And we've been focusing on this
overlap thing that causes the

00:27:33.396 --> 00:27:36.118
bonding, but obviously things
aren't going to collapse because

00:27:36.118 --> 00:27:37.190
of the nuclear part.
 

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.487
But we haven't been talking
about it explicitly;

00:27:40.487 --> 00:27:41.538
you're right.
 

00:27:41.538 --> 00:27:44.358
Okay, so anyhow this is the
form of the bonding potential,

00:27:44.358 --> 00:27:47.313
the Morse potential,
which was just cobbled together

00:27:47.313 --> 00:27:50.382
artificially to make it
convenient to calculate things

00:27:50.382 --> 00:27:53.220
and to have reasonable
properties for a bond.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:57.390
But now we understand why it
should look like that.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.492
This first part,
the attractive part,

00:27:59.492 --> 00:28:02.529
is because the electron pair
becomes more stable with

00:28:02.529 --> 00:28:05.509
increasing overlap,
as the atoms come together.

00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:09.103
And then the nuclear repulsion
becomes dominant,

00:28:09.103 --> 00:28:11.090
when it becomes too close.
 

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.779
Right?
 

00:28:11.779 --> 00:28:15.180
So all this is Coulomb's Law.
 

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.548
There's nothing special.
 

00:28:16.548 --> 00:28:18.383
There's not
‘correlation

00:28:18.383 --> 00:28:21.189
energy', which is some
completely new physical

00:28:21.189 --> 00:28:21.818
phenomenon.
 

00:28:21.818 --> 00:28:22.450
Right?
 

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.720
It's all Coulombic.
 

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.482
Correlation energy is just,
remember, an excuse for the

00:28:28.482 --> 00:28:31.480
error you're making,
or a way to hide it.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.223
Okay, so it all comes from
Coulomb's Law for potential

00:28:35.223 --> 00:28:35.858
energy.
 

00:28:35.858 --> 00:28:39.412
But the funny thing was the
kinetic energy of the electrons,

00:28:39.412 --> 00:28:41.218
according to Schrödinger.
 

00:28:41.218 --> 00:28:41.759
Right?
 

00:28:41.759 --> 00:28:44.570
Because as you make things --
as you concentrate things,

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:46.358
you change the curvature as
well.

00:28:46.358 --> 00:28:48.630
So you have to take that into
account.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:54.180
But this curve provides the
potential for studying molecular

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.195
vibration;
that is, once you know the form

00:28:57.195 --> 00:28:59.616
of this curve,
then you can use quantum

00:28:59.616 --> 00:29:02.088
mechanics for the motion of the
atoms --

00:29:02.088 --> 00:29:03.970
not of the electrons but of the
atoms --

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.118
and figure out how atoms
vibrate;

00:29:06.118 --> 00:29:09.170
which we've already done,
when we were doing Erwin

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.519
Meets Goldilocks.
 

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:14.078
Okay, but here,
finally we understand the

00:29:14.078 --> 00:29:15.858
atom-atom force law.
 

00:29:15.858 --> 00:29:16.660
Right?
 

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.210
That's what we've been doing
the whole time,

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:21.009
for four weeks or five weeks or
whatever it's been,

00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:24.680
is trying to understand where
-- what the force law is.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.038
Wouldn't Newton be happy?
 

00:29:26.038 --> 00:29:27.952
Remember, he said,
"There are therefore

00:29:27.952 --> 00:29:30.355
agents in Nature able to make
particles of bodies stick

00:29:30.355 --> 00:29:32.180
together by very strong
attractions,

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.760
and it's the business of
Experimental Philosophy to find

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.559
them out."
 

00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:37.598
And now we've found it out.
 

00:29:37.598 --> 00:29:42.682
Now, can we use this
understanding then to gain

00:29:42.682 --> 00:29:46.220
greater purchase on chemistry?
 

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.460
So we've looked at overlap.
 

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.618
But there's one other thing we
have to look at,

00:29:50.618 --> 00:29:53.642
in order to apply it,
and that's what we call

00:29:53.642 --> 00:29:54.808
energy-match.
 

00:29:54.808 --> 00:29:57.885
I don't think anybody else
talks about energy-match,

00:29:57.885 --> 00:29:58.608
but we do.
 

00:29:58.608 --> 00:30:01.749
Okay, so here's what we talked
about already.

00:30:01.749 --> 00:30:02.318
Right?
 

00:30:02.318 --> 00:30:05.833
And we have this splitting,
which is about proportional to

00:30:05.833 --> 00:30:06.450
overlap.
 

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:09.423
It's not numerically strictly
proportional to overlap,

00:30:09.423 --> 00:30:12.509
but it certainly is close to
proportional to overlap.

00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:16.650
Okay, now what would happen if
the two atoms you started with

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.894
were not the same,
if one was a better place for

00:30:19.894 --> 00:30:25.920
electrons to be than the other;
like there for example?

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.250
So why would you -- remember
what happened is you mix these.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.000
You get A+B and A-B.
 

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.455
But why would you put
any A together

00:30:35.455 --> 00:30:38.630
with B, if B is already much
better than A?

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:41.544
If they're equal,
you don't care where it is,

00:30:41.544 --> 00:30:43.730
then fine, use a 50/50 mixture.
 

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:48.998
But if one's better than the
other, why use any of the

00:30:48.998 --> 00:30:50.490
inferior one?
 

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.578
Why not just use the one that's
good?

00:30:53.578 --> 00:30:58.616
So we already actually saw this
in the case of the 1s

00:30:58.616 --> 00:31:01.797
atomic orbitals,
which did remain pure and

00:31:01.797 --> 00:31:05.346
unmixed, when we made the
molecular orbitals of that funny

00:31:05.346 --> 00:31:09.609
molecule last time,
the fluoroethanol.

00:31:09.609 --> 00:31:10.548
Remember, it looked like that.
 

00:31:10.548 --> 00:31:12.890
One of them was just an
s orbital on F;

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:15.410
another one was an s
orbital on O;

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.887
s orbital on one carbon,
s orbital on the other

00:31:17.887 --> 00:31:18.259
carbon.
 

00:31:18.259 --> 00:31:23.460
The didn't mix. Right?
 

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.500
So the compact 1s core
orbitals did remain pure and

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.611
unmixed, but the valence level
atomic orbitals were heavily

00:31:31.611 --> 00:31:32.318
mixed.
 

00:31:32.318 --> 00:31:35.009
For example,
the next one was biggest on

00:31:35.009 --> 00:31:39.147
fluorine, but also substantial
on oxygen, and carbon even got

00:31:39.147 --> 00:31:40.941
into the act a little bit.
 

00:31:40.941 --> 00:31:41.700
Right?
 

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:47.972
Now why is it that the core
orbitals didn't mix and the

00:31:47.972 --> 00:31:51.109
valence orbitals did mix?
 

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:54.390
What's different?
 

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:58.829
The core orbitals are very
small, very compact.

00:31:58.829 --> 00:32:00.410
These orbitals are bigger.
 

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:02.589
So what happens?
 

00:32:02.589 --> 00:32:05.308
They overlap. Right?
 

00:32:05.308 --> 00:32:09.858
So it's overlap that causes
things to mix.

00:32:09.858 --> 00:32:11.720
If there's no overlap they
don't mix.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.150
If they overlap they mix.
 

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.930
So why use any of an inferior
orbital?

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:21.046
Well suppose the energy of A is
much higher, less favorable,

00:32:21.046 --> 00:32:22.420
than that of B. Right?
 

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.540
So now we make a sum,
a weighted sum,

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.009
a parts of A,
b parts of B,

00:32:29.009 --> 00:32:30.828
and we square it.
 

00:32:30.828 --> 00:32:34.416
So we get a^2^( )parts
of the A density,

00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:38.942
b^2^( )parts of the B
density, and also this overlap

00:32:38.942 --> 00:32:40.578
term, 2ab.
 

00:32:40.578 --> 00:32:44.990
Now, can you profit from
shifting electron density toward

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:49.560
the inter-nuclear AB region,
without paying too much of the

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.608
high energy cost of A?
 

00:32:51.608 --> 00:32:55.173
That is, A^2^( )is higher
energy than B^2.

00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:55.868
Right?
 

00:32:55.868 --> 00:32:58.930
The electron density around A
is higher energy than the

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:00.460
electron density about B.
 

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.540
And if you mix A with B,
you're going to get a certain

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.005
amount of that bad,
or less good,

00:33:07.005 --> 00:33:08.700
distribution,
A^2.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.838
But at the same time you're
going to get some of AB,

00:33:12.838 --> 00:33:17.710
which puts stuff in the middle,
at the expense of outside.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.200
That's good. Right?
 

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.078
At a certain distance from the
nuclei, you'd rather be between

00:33:24.078 --> 00:33:27.680
the two nuclei than out beyond
one of them.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.194
So as you increase a,
you increase -- oops sorry

00:33:31.194 --> 00:33:33.278
&gt;
 

00:33:33.278 --> 00:33:37.249
-- you increase this bad part,
but you also increase that good

00:33:37.249 --> 00:33:37.900
part.
 

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.710
Can it be worthwhile to make
a non-0?

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:43.150
Which one is going to help?
 

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.630
But notice this.
 

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:49.431
If you put only a small amount
of A in, then the amount of

00:33:49.431 --> 00:33:52.884
A^2^( )probability density,
this bit here,

00:33:52.884 --> 00:33:57.082
is a^2 parts of that;
really, really tiny,

00:33:57.082 --> 00:33:58.660
if a is tiny.
 

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.250
But the amount of ab you
put in is a times

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:03.882
b, not a^2.
 

00:34:03.882 --> 00:34:04.470
Right?
 

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:05.430
So it's much bigger.
 

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:12.244
So you get this good stuff,
without getting very much of

00:34:12.244 --> 00:34:14.103
this bad stuff.
 

00:34:14.103 --> 00:34:15.219
Right?
 

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:17.873
For example,
suppose you used,

00:34:17.873 --> 00:34:21.719
a was 0.03 and b
was 0.98.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:23.909
So you square them,
to find out how much --

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:26.266
&lt;&lt;technical
adjustment&gt;&gt;

00:34:26.266 --> 00:34:29.304
-- you square them,
and you find out that the

00:34:29.304 --> 00:34:32.039
amount of a^2 you get is
only 0.001.

00:34:32.039 --> 00:34:34.670
The amount of b^2 is
0.96.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.268
And the amount of 2ab is
0.06.

00:34:37.268 --> 00:34:41.454
So you're getting sixty times
as much of ab as you get

00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:42.570
of a^2.
 

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:45.679
So that's why it can be useful
to put a little bit in.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:49.561
And if you're pedantic,
you can look at the footnote

00:34:49.561 --> 00:34:50.170
there.
 

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:53.577
So let's look at Erwin Meets
Goldilocks in the case where

00:34:53.577 --> 00:34:56.876
the two wells are not matched,
where the energies are a little

00:34:56.876 --> 00:34:58.974
bit different;
because that's what we're

00:34:58.974 --> 00:34:59.650
talking about.
 

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:04.380
So here are non-degenerate
atomic orbitals.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.849
So the one on the left is a
little bit lower than the one on

00:35:07.849 --> 00:35:09.849
the right, but only a teeny bit.
 

00:35:09.849 --> 00:35:11.050
Okay?
 

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:13.260
Now we're going to look at the
wave functions here.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.005
So there's the lowest energy
wave function.

00:35:16.005 --> 00:35:16.530
Right?
 

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:20.688
And notice it's the sum,
it's a weighted sum,

00:35:20.688 --> 00:35:22.199
with no nodes.
 

00:35:22.199 --> 00:35:25.715
But there's almost no mixing at
all, just a really,

00:35:25.715 --> 00:35:28.530
really, really tiny amount of A
in it.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:32.693
So essentially it's just the
solution you'd get in the left

00:35:32.693 --> 00:35:33.052
well.
 

00:35:33.052 --> 00:35:33.699
Right?
 

00:35:33.699 --> 00:35:36.768
There'd be one with one node as
well.

00:35:36.768 --> 00:35:41.050
What will it look like,
can you guess?

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:43.969
This is the one with zero nodes.
 

00:35:43.969 --> 00:35:46.489
What's the wave function with
one node look like?

00:35:46.489 --> 00:35:50.000
Any guesses?
 

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.369
Yes, Josh?
 

00:35:51.369 --> 00:35:53.164
Student:  It'll just
have a node in the middle of

00:35:53.164 --> 00:35:55.190
that first potential and then be
straight on the second one.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.000
Prof: And be what?
 

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.268
Student:  And be sort of
straight on the second one.

00:36:00.268 --> 00:36:01.326
Prof: Right.
 

00:36:01.326 --> 00:36:03.103
So the first one,
the lowest one,

00:36:03.103 --> 00:36:04.550
is the one on the left.
 

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:06.576
The second one,
the next highest energy

00:36:06.576 --> 00:36:09.670
orbital, is the one on the
right, with just a little bit of

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.789
the one on the left in it;
negligible amount of mixing.

00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:13.170
Right?
 

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:16.159
And their energies,
you might think their energies

00:36:16.159 --> 00:36:19.090
would be the same,
because they're not mixing.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:24.983
But the green one is in this
well, and the red one is in that

00:36:24.983 --> 00:36:28.030
well, and that well's higher.
 

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.730
Okay?
 

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.219
So it's got to be higher in
energy.

00:36:30.219 --> 00:36:33.909
That spitting is due only to
the original offset between the

00:36:33.909 --> 00:36:34.409
wells.
 

00:36:34.409 --> 00:36:37.030
There's no shift of it. Right?
 

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.885
It's just you have A or you
have B, and you have what you

00:36:39.885 --> 00:36:41.110
would expect for them.
 

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:46.730
Now suppose we increase the
overlap between these.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:52.030
What do you think is going to
happen?

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:55.786
You should get a little more
mixing because AB is going to

00:36:55.786 --> 00:36:58.289
count for more,
if you have overlap.

00:36:58.289 --> 00:36:59.780
Okay, so here they are close
together.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.443
You still don't have very much
mixing, just a little bit,

00:37:03.443 --> 00:37:06.648
and you haven't seen any
appreciable change in the

00:37:06.648 --> 00:37:07.500
energies.
 

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.619
You still have that same
splitting that's due to the

00:37:10.619 --> 00:37:11.719
original offset.
 

00:37:11.719 --> 00:37:12.280
Okay?
 

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.219
Now we'll bring them still
closer together.

00:37:15.219 --> 00:37:19.003
And now it's getting worthwhile
to put it in the wrong well,

00:37:19.003 --> 00:37:21.248
because the AB term is so
important.

00:37:21.248 --> 00:37:21.889
Right?
 

00:37:21.889 --> 00:37:24.780
So the antibonding energy is
rising,

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.561
the bonding energy is falling
-- that's why they're

00:37:27.561 --> 00:37:31.902
antibonding and bonding --
and if we bring them still

00:37:31.902 --> 00:37:35.670
closer together,
we get that. Right?

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:40.838
Which, if you looked at it
casually, they look like a

00:37:40.838 --> 00:37:42.230
single well.
 

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:46.271
But notice that they're still
quite unsymmetrical,

00:37:46.271 --> 00:37:48.170
they're still biased.
 

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:52.213
The one without any nodes is
still mostly in the left well,

00:37:52.213 --> 00:37:55.980
and the one with a node is
mostly in the right well.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.610
But they're heavily mixed.
 

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:58.050
Right?
 

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:00.887
So what's happening is this
increasing overlap,

00:38:00.887 --> 00:38:04.344
as you bring them together,
is fighting the effect of the

00:38:04.344 --> 00:38:06.320
difference in the two wells.
 

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.295
So when we had the core
electrons in fluoroethanol,

00:38:10.295 --> 00:38:13.715
if we had tiny orbitals that
didn't overlap,

00:38:13.715 --> 00:38:15.465
then they stayed pure.
 

00:38:15.465 --> 00:38:16.340
Right?
 

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.809
But once we went to the valence
level orbitals,

00:38:18.809 --> 00:38:21.280
that were much bigger,
so that they overlapped,

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.429
then they started mixing,
like this.

00:38:23.429 --> 00:38:29.860
Okay, now what if one partner
is lower in energy than A?

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.510
That's the case we're dealing
with.

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:34.018
But what will these ultimate
energies be,

00:38:34.018 --> 00:38:37.579
when you have this competition
between overlap,

00:38:37.579 --> 00:38:41.760
which is trying to mix them,
and energy mismatch,

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.760
which is trying to keep them
separate from one another?

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.820
So here's what you get.
 

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:51.771
You get again splitting,
but not as much shift as you

00:38:51.771 --> 00:38:52.760
got before.
 

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.960
The lower level will look
mostly like C,

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.340
because C is better than A.
 

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.862
The antibonding will look
mostly like A,

00:39:00.862 --> 00:39:03.190
with just a little bit of C in
it.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:07.876
And if they had had the same
energy, you'd get a big energy

00:39:07.876 --> 00:39:10.059
shift because of overlap.
 

00:39:10.059 --> 00:39:13.228
But now you get a smaller
energy shift,

00:39:13.228 --> 00:39:16.315
because the mismatch is
fighting that.

00:39:16.315 --> 00:39:17.150
Right?
 

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:20.663
You don't want to -- you lose
as you try to mix,

00:39:20.663 --> 00:39:23.728
because of the difference
between A and C,

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:25.000
in this case.
 

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.655
Now, so that one looks mostly
like C, both in shape and in

00:39:30.655 --> 00:39:31.550
energy.
 

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:35.070
That one looks mostly like A,
both in shape and energy.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:38.148
But it's a little worse than A,
and the first one is a little

00:39:38.148 --> 00:39:38.969
better than C.
 

00:39:38.969 --> 00:39:46.070
Now how much smaller is that
bonding shift?

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.623
When they were mismatched,
they didn't shift as much with

00:39:48.623 --> 00:39:49.489
the same overlap.
 

00:39:49.489 --> 00:39:51.260
How much less?
 

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.710
Exactly where does it end up?
 

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.400
Well that's not so crucially
important to you,

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.389
but there's a neat trick you
can do to see that.

00:39:58.389 --> 00:40:02.360
Suppose we have that much
energy mismatch.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:02.940
Okay?
 

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.681
And the red dot is halfway
between B and C,

00:40:06.681 --> 00:40:10.690
or between A and C,
since A and B are the same

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:11.670
energy.
 

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:14.264
Now, so when they were
perfectly matched,

00:40:14.264 --> 00:40:17.574
A and B perfectly matched in
energy, that's how much

00:40:17.574 --> 00:40:20.820
splitting you got from that
amount of overlap.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:24.012
So these are the two factors
that go into it:

00:40:24.012 --> 00:40:28.146
how much splitting you get when
they have the same energy,

00:40:28.146 --> 00:40:31.630
and how different the original
energies are.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:36.221
How can you put those together,
to find out how much shift you

00:40:36.221 --> 00:40:37.349
actually get?
 

00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:40.579
Well what we do is slide that
over,

00:40:40.579 --> 00:40:48.105
and then bend down the blue
one, so it's perpendicular to

00:40:48.105 --> 00:40:51.929
that,
and make a rectangle around it,

00:40:51.929 --> 00:40:53.969
and draw the diagonal.
 

00:40:53.969 --> 00:40:59.677
And that diagonal will be the
new energy difference between

00:40:59.677 --> 00:41:01.349
the new levels.
 

00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:02.119
Okay?
 

00:41:02.119 --> 00:41:04.570
You say, why do I make this
construction?

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:07.159
It's because there's a
quadratic formula that comes in.

00:41:07.159 --> 00:41:11.574
So the diagonal is the square
root of the squares of the two

00:41:11.574 --> 00:41:15.239
sides, the sum of the squares of
the two sides.

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:18.981
Okay, so we can rotate that;
put a tack in there and rotate

00:41:18.981 --> 00:41:19.289
it.
 

00:41:19.289 --> 00:41:23.019
And that's going to be the new
energy difference.

00:41:23.019 --> 00:41:23.860
Okay?
 

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.996
And it's bigger than the
original energy difference,

00:41:26.996 --> 00:41:30.809
because the diagonal has to be
bigger than one of the sides.

00:41:30.809 --> 00:41:32.721
But because of the
normalization,

00:41:32.721 --> 00:41:35.469
because one of them is a little
less than --

00:41:35.469 --> 00:41:38.559
one of them is a little smaller
and one's a little greater --

00:41:38.559 --> 00:41:42.380
that was the less than/greater
than √2,

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.469
1/√2 thing -- it's
going to shift up a little bit,

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:48.030
both levels will shift up a
little bit, like that.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:48.449
Right?
 

00:41:48.449 --> 00:41:49.690
I'll do it again so you see it.
 

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:50.969
Both will shift up.
 

00:41:50.969 --> 00:41:53.679
So there are the new levels.
 

00:41:53.679 --> 00:41:56.010
That's how you do it.
 

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.099
Okay?
 

00:41:57.099 --> 00:42:03.289
Now, so for a given overlap,
the bonding shift,

00:42:03.289 --> 00:42:06.500
how much the electrons changed
when the atoms came together,

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:10.679
is reduced if the energies
aren't well matched,

00:42:10.679 --> 00:42:13.059
if you have the same overlap.
 

00:42:13.059 --> 00:42:16.969
You don't get as strong a bond,
from that point of view.

00:42:16.969 --> 00:42:20.768
The energies didn't shift down
as much, or up as much.

00:42:20.768 --> 00:42:29.259
But still A+C will be lower in
energy than the original one

00:42:29.259 --> 00:42:30.869
was, A+B.
 

00:42:30.869 --> 00:42:31.679
Okay?
 

00:42:31.679 --> 00:42:35.574
And we had that construction,
which shows us an interesting

00:42:35.574 --> 00:42:38.034
thing,
which is the splitting is not

00:42:38.034 --> 00:42:41.485
very sensitive to the one of
these contributions that's

00:42:41.485 --> 00:42:42.190
smaller.
 

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:45.349
There are two contributions:
the overlap part,

00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:47.719
that's the black arrow -- or
pardon me,

00:42:47.719 --> 00:42:51.860
that's the blue arrow -- and
the energy difference,

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.110
the energy mismatch,
which is the black arrow.

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:59.311
But if one of those is very
small, like here,

00:42:59.311 --> 00:43:01.987
the mismatch,
which is black,

00:43:01.987 --> 00:43:04.661
is very big,
and the overlap,

00:43:04.661 --> 00:43:07.909
the blue one,
is very small.

00:43:07.909 --> 00:43:11.652
But you can see that the length
of the diagonal is not going to

00:43:11.652 --> 00:43:14.250
be very sensitive to what the
overlap is.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:18.661
You could increase that blue
overlap, the width of the

00:43:18.661 --> 00:43:23.489
rectangle, which wouldn't change
the diagonal very much.

00:43:23.489 --> 00:43:26.739
So it's sensitive to the one
that's bigger.

00:43:26.739 --> 00:43:29.150
Okay, don't worry too much
about that part.

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.909
I just think it's fun.
 

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:34.518
Okay, so we can generalize from
this.

00:43:34.518 --> 00:43:38.172
Mixing two overlapping orbitals
gives one composite orbital

00:43:38.172 --> 00:43:41.510
that's lower in energy than
either of the parents,

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:45.099
and one that's higher in energy
than either of the parents.

00:43:45.099 --> 00:43:45.650
Okay?
 

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:48.813
The lower energy combination
looks -- that is,

00:43:48.813 --> 00:43:52.469
its shape -- is most like the
lower energy parent;

00:43:52.469 --> 00:43:54.576
and the same is true for
energy.

00:43:54.576 --> 00:43:55.119
Right?
 

00:43:55.119 --> 00:43:58.980
And the higher one looks like
the higher parent.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:02.396
For a given overlap,
increasing energy mismatch

00:44:02.396 --> 00:44:06.925
decreases the amount of mixing,
and decreases the magnitude of

00:44:06.925 --> 00:44:08.559
the energy shifts.
 

00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:11.550
Now what does this have to do
with bonding?

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:16.659
Okay, the AC electrons are
clearly lower in energy.

00:44:16.659 --> 00:44:19.190
But that's not really what
we're interested in.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:22.329
We're interested in the
change of energy

00:44:22.329 --> 00:44:25.590
that comes when you break the
bond, or make the bond.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:29.949
So which bond is stronger,
AB or AC?

00:44:29.949 --> 00:44:34.159
How many think AB is stronger,
given this scheme?

00:44:34.159 --> 00:44:36.619
How many think AC is stronger?
 

00:44:36.619 --> 00:44:40.070
It's clearly got lower energy
electrons, AC.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:44.210
But this is a classic example
of "compared to what?"

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.130
Okay?
 

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:47.869
How are we going to break the
bond?

00:44:47.869 --> 00:44:51.485
Suppose what we're going to do
is break it, to put two

00:44:51.485 --> 00:44:54.625
electrons in C,
because that's the lower energy

00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:56.809
atom;
or in the other case,

00:44:56.809 --> 00:44:58.829
to put two electrons in B.
 

00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:59.219
Okay?
 

00:44:59.219 --> 00:45:01.500
So both electrons go the same
way.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.710
Can you see anything bad about
that?

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:08.329
Why might it be better to put
one electron each way?

00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:10.369
Kevin?
 

00:45:10.369 --> 00:45:13.559
Student:  Well in terms
of spin, they have to be --

00:45:13.559 --> 00:45:14.420
Prof: Not spin.
 

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.960
You can put two electrons in an
orbital with opposite spin.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.789
So spin's not a problem,
if you only have two.

00:45:20.789 --> 00:45:23.621
If you had three it would be a
problem, but with two,

00:45:23.621 --> 00:45:24.929
spin is not a problem.
 

00:45:24.929 --> 00:45:27.346
But there's an obvious problem
with having both the electrons

00:45:27.346 --> 00:45:27.829
go to one.
 

00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:28.599
Dana?
 

00:45:28.599 --> 00:45:29.150
Student:  They'll repel
each other.

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:30.360
Prof: They'll repel each
other.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.619
If you could put them on
opposite ones,

00:45:31.619 --> 00:45:32.251
so much the better.
 

00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:32.550
Right?
 

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:36.581
But it would be possible to do
this, and it might plausible in

00:45:36.581 --> 00:45:39.623
the case of AC,
where C is lower in energy than

00:45:39.623 --> 00:45:41.847
A;
although the repulsion might

00:45:41.847 --> 00:45:44.719
make it better to go one on C
and one on A.

00:45:44.719 --> 00:45:46.849
Okay, but anyhow,
suppose you break it this way.

00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:48.639
Which one would be easier to
break?

00:45:48.639 --> 00:45:52.119
Which requires less energy,
red or blue?

00:45:52.119 --> 00:45:52.960
Students:  Red.
 

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.889
Prof: Red requires less
energy.

00:45:54.889 --> 00:45:59.364
Okay, so AB is stronger,
if you're forming A^+ B^-,

00:45:59.364 --> 00:46:03.304
if both the electrons are going
the same way.

00:46:03.304 --> 00:46:04.199
Right?
 

00:46:04.199 --> 00:46:08.650
So mismatch aids heterolysis.
 

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:11.108
Heterolysis,
(uneven breaking) is to put

00:46:11.108 --> 00:46:14.445
them both on the same side,
rather than one on each side

00:46:14.445 --> 00:46:17.550
(that's called homolysis,
as you'll see in a second).

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:21.302
So if you put them both on one
side, then it's easier to break

00:46:21.302 --> 00:46:22.780
if they're mismatched.
 

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.710
The bond is stronger if they're
well matched.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:26.909
Okay?
 

00:46:26.909 --> 00:46:28.719
That's because that.
 

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:34.619
But now suppose you do
homolysis and put one on each.

00:46:34.619 --> 00:46:37.579
Now which one's easier?
 

00:46:37.579 --> 00:46:38.190
Student:  The blue one.
 

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:42.690
Prof: Now the blue is
less energy than the red.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:43.409
Okay?
 

00:46:43.409 --> 00:46:47.320
So now the AC is going to be
stronger.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:51.471
So mismatch hinders homolysis.
 

00:46:51.471 --> 00:46:52.440
Right?
 

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.293
So you can't really say which
bond is stronger,

00:46:55.293 --> 00:46:58.025
unless you say,
"Compared to what -- how

00:46:58.025 --> 00:47:00.260
are you breaking it apart?"
 

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:00.670
Okay?
 

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:03.268
Is all this true?
 

00:47:03.268 --> 00:47:06.237
So I've been weaving this
fairytale for you,

00:47:06.237 --> 00:47:09.480
for the last couple of weeks,
but is it true?

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.869
Well, we can check it with
experiment.

00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:14.630
For example, compare HH with HF.
 

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:19.130
HH has perfect matching between
the two atoms.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:22.480
In HF, there's a much bigger
nuclear charge on F;

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.969
electrons in the valence
orbital are lower in energy on F

00:47:25.969 --> 00:47:27.280
than they are on H.
 

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.800
Okay, so if we look at the
σ orbital,

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.539
the valence σ
orbital,

00:47:31.539 --> 00:47:35.231
it's symmetrical in the case of
H_2 and quite unsymmetrical in

00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:36.260
the case of HF.
 

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:40.650
It's big on F and small on H,
just as we were speaking of.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:43.880
That's the σ,
big on F. Right?

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:48.271
But there's also an antibonding
orbital, σ,

00:47:48.271 --> 00:47:49.789
which has a node.
 

00:47:49.789 --> 00:47:54.280
So that one is the contrary;
it's big on H, small on F.

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:57.309
This is just what we were
talking about a few minutes ago.

00:47:57.309 --> 00:48:00.023
And the electrons,
of course, are only in the

00:48:00.023 --> 00:48:02.860
σ*,
not in the σ*;

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.309
there are only two electrons
and that one's empty.

00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:09.782
And the * means that it's
antibonding.

00:48:09.782 --> 00:48:10.750
Right?
 

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.597
So it has the node between the
nuclei, planar in the

00:48:14.597 --> 00:48:18.070
symmetrical case and bent in the
case of HF;

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.389
but it's still the node.
 

00:48:20.389 --> 00:48:23.530
Now, how about the experiment?
 

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.882
Heterolysis,
where you break,

00:48:25.882 --> 00:48:28.907
in order to get H^+ H^-,
in one case,

00:48:28.907 --> 00:48:31.679
or H^+ F^- in the other case.
 

00:48:31.679 --> 00:48:34.717
In the case of HH,
it costs 400 kilocalories to

00:48:34.717 --> 00:48:35.840
break the bond.
 

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:39.760
In the case of HF,
it costs only 373.

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.960
Incidentally,
this is a lot of energy,

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.934
to break this bond,
because you're putting both the

00:48:44.934 --> 00:48:46.659
electrons the same place.
 

00:48:46.659 --> 00:48:49.572
It can happen in solution,
but it's not so easy in the gas

00:48:49.572 --> 00:48:51.768
phase, which is what we're
talking about.

00:48:51.768 --> 00:48:57.179
Okay, so indeed we were right,
that mismatch weakens the bond;

00:48:57.179 --> 00:49:01.679
for heterolysis,
the HF bond is weaker.

00:49:01.679 --> 00:49:04.704
That's why you call it
hydrofluoric acid,

00:49:04.704 --> 00:49:06.889
because it can easily break off
an H.

00:49:06.889 --> 00:49:12.545
You don't call H_2 hydrogenic
acid or something like that.

00:49:12.545 --> 00:49:13.340
Right?
 

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:17.344
But if you break it into two
atoms,

00:49:17.344 --> 00:49:22.436
two H atoms or an H atom and an
F atom, then it costs only 104

00:49:22.436 --> 00:49:24.690
for HH, but 136 for HF.
 

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:28.320
So the HF bond is stronger,
if you're breaking to atoms.

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.226
So that's the first
verification,

00:49:30.226 --> 00:49:33.445
experimental verification,
of what I've been talking to

00:49:33.445 --> 00:49:34.280
you about.
 

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.516
And we're going to go on next
time to talk about XH_3,

00:49:37.516 --> 00:49:40.875
which will have lots of
experimental data that will show

00:49:40.875 --> 00:49:42.829
that this stuff is sensible.

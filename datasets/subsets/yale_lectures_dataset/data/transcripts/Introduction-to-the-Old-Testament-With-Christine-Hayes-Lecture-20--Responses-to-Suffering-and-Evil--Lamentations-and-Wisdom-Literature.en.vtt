00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.633
Professor Christine
Hayes: When Nebuchadnezzar

00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:06.516
of Babylon burned the temple and
destroyed Jerusalem,

00:00:06.516 --> 00:00:09.954
the initial reaction was one of
overwhelming grief and sadness,

00:00:09.954 --> 00:00:12.505
and that's represented
primarily in the Book of

00:00:12.505 --> 00:00:15.848
Lamentations.
It's a very short book of

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:20.901
dirges that laments the loss of
Jerusalem as the death of a

00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:23.613
beloved person.
And it's traditionally

00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:24.860
attributed to Jeremiah.
 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.820
The Bible itself doesn't make
this claim;

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.650
it's an old tradition.
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.100
It may have arisen,
however, because of all of the

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.150
prophets, Jeremiah is the one
who reveals the most to us about

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.000
his personal suffering and
grief,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.994
and because he was present as
an eyewitness at the

00:00:38.994 --> 00:00:41.838
destruction.
There's no real logical

00:00:41.838 --> 00:00:46.421
development of ideas in
Lamentations primarily because

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:50.140
it's structured by an artificial
device.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.200
There are five chapters and
four of the chapters are

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.668
acrostic poems.
This means that each verse,

00:00:55.668 --> 00:00:58.618
or sometimes a series of
verses, begins with a letter of

00:00:58.618 --> 00:01:00.119
the alphabet in sequence.
 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:03.335
So in chapter 3 you have three
verses per letter of the

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:05.724
alphabet.
But this kind of acrostic

00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:09.470
poetic formation gives the poem
a kind of formal unity,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.980
at the same time that it has no
logical unity or logical flow.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.521
And it's been pointed out that
that form is particularly

00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:21.448
appropriate for an expression of
grief that is too profound or

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.959
too all encompassing to be
logical.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.484
The Lamentations over Jerusalem
resemble very much David's

00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:29.030
lamentations over Saul.
 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.313
The mourner spends time
contrasting the former splendor

00:01:32.313 --> 00:01:35.050
of the beloved to his or her
present state.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.433
And we have lots of Ancient
Near Eastern prototypes for this

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:40.555
kind of
lamentation--lamentations over

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:43.824
destroyed cities which are
understood as the result of the

00:01:43.824 --> 00:01:46.290
deity's decision to abandon the
city.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.387
In Lamentations we're given a
very detailed picture of the

00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:54.270
great suffering that accompanied
the final collapse.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.320
Lamentations 1:1:
"Alas!

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.920
Lonely sits the city
Once great with people!

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.980
She that was great among nations
Is become like a widow;

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.100
The princess among states
Is become a thrall."

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.650
Chapter 4:
Alas!

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.040
The gold is dulled,
Debased the finest gold,

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.230
The sacred gems are spilled a
At every street corner.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.659
The precious children of Zion;
Once valued as gold--

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.930
Alas, they are accounted as
earthen pots,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.950
Work of a potter's hands!
 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.870
Even jackals offer the breast
And suckle their young;

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.700
But my poor people has turned
cruel,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.370
Like ostriches of the desert.
 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.450
The tongue of the suckling
cleaves

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.920
To its palate for thirst.
 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.580
Little children beg for bread;
None give them a morsel.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.800
Those who feasted on dainties
Lie famished in the streets;

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.110
Those who were reared in purple
Have embraced refuse heaps.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.330
The guilt of my poor people
Exceeded the iniquity of Sodom,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.360
Which was overthrown in a
moment,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.690
Without a hand striking it.
 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.990
Her elect were purer then snow,
Whiter then milk;

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.590
Their limbs were ruddier then
coral,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.430
Their bodies were like sapphire.
 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.349
Again, the description of the
physical beauty of the beloved,

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.610
Now their faces are blacker
then soot,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.460
They are not recognized in the
streets;

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.350
Their skin has shriveled on
their bones,

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.069
It has become dry as wood.
 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.350
Better off were the slain of
the sword

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.062
Than those slain by famine,
Who pined away,

00:03:12.062 --> 00:03:13.479
[as though]
wounded,

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.349
For lack of the fruits of the
field.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.800
With their own hands,
tenderhearted women

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.169
Have cooked their children;
Such became their fare,

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.180
In the disaster of my poor
people.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.487
The poet here,
though, does adopt the standard

00:03:27.487 --> 00:03:31.971
Deuteronomistic interpretation
of events which infers sin from

00:03:31.971 --> 00:03:33.728
suffering,
and therefore,

00:03:33.728 --> 00:03:36.484
harps on the sin and the
uncleanness of Jerusalem that

00:03:36.484 --> 00:03:37.940
brought on this calamity.
 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.024
Their guilt exceeded the
iniquity of Sodom in the passage

00:03:41.024 --> 00:03:43.392
we just read,
and this is a strategy that of

00:03:43.392 --> 00:03:44.770
course justifies God.
 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.487
The poet singles out the
corrupt priests,

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:49.729
the corrupt prophets for blame.
 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:54.050
He attacks the popular ideology
of the inviolability of Zion.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.618
Israel's many sins are what
caused Yahweh to pour out his

00:03:57.618 --> 00:04:00.039
wrath and destroy Jerusalem
utterly.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.345
The descriptions of Yahweh's
wrath, anger,

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:04.875
his consuming rage,
these are some of the most

00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:08.080
powerful and most violent poetry
in the Hebrew Bible.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.624
They tend to divert attention,
in fact, from the people's

00:04:11.624 --> 00:04:14.599
guilt and focus attention on
their suffering.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.739
Children crying for bread,
children starving to death,

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.279
women raped,
men abused.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.931
In chapter 3,
the poet switches into the

00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:26.010
first person so Jerusalem is
speaking like one who is pursued

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.798
and abused,
beaten by an angry and violent

00:04:28.798 --> 00:04:30.850
master.
Chapter 3:

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.930
I am the man who has
known affliction

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.120
Under the rod of His wrath;
Me he drove on and on

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.286
In unrelieved darkness;
On none but me He brings down

00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:41.540
His hand
Again and again, without cease.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.930
He has worn away my flesh and
skin;

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.130
He has shattered my bones.
 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.339
All around me He has built
Misery and hardship;

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:50.030
He has made me dwell in
darkness,

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.470
Like those long dead.
 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.889
He has walled me in and I
cannot break out;

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.660
He has weighed me down with
chains.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.970
And when I cry and plead,
He shuts out my prayer;

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.670
He has walled in my ways with
hewn blocks,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.830
He has made my paths a maze.
 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.279
He is a lurking bear to me,
A lion in hiding;

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.250
He has forced me off my way and
mangled me,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.110
He has left me numb.
A remarkably violent passage.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.413
And in another remarkable
passage, the poet describes God

00:05:17.413 --> 00:05:20.010
as refusing to hear the prayers
of Israel.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.220
He no longer can forgive.
 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.300
He simply has to punish.
 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.389
This is in chapter 3 as well,
verses 42 to 45.

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.330
We have transgressed and
rebelled,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.509
And You have not forgiven.
 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.870
You have clothed Yourself in
anger and pursued us,

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.230
You have slain without pity.
 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.200
You have screened Yourself off
with a cloud

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.269
That no prayer may pass through.
 

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:40.279
You have made us filth and
refuse

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.240
In the midst of the
peoples.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.199
So God is simply refusing to
even hear Israel's prayer.

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.848
This is an emphasis not so much
on Israel's guilt,

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:50.118
but on Israel's tremendous
suffering, God's

00:05:50.118 --> 00:05:54.412
hardheartedness.
The poem ends with a plea of

00:05:54.412 --> 00:05:57.509
reconciliation in 5:19-22.
 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.730
But You,
O Lord, are enthroned forever,

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.019
Your throne endures through the
ages.

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:04.330
Why have you forgotten us
utterly,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.120
Forsaken us for all time?
 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.010
Take us back,
O Lord, to Yourself,

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.180
And let us come back;
Renew our days as of old!

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.550
For truly, You have rejected us,
Bitterly raged against us.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.590
Take us back,
O Lord, to Yourself,

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.389
And let us come back;
Renew our days as of old!

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.486
Lamentations represents one
response to the fall of

00:06:23.486 --> 00:06:26.833
Jerusalem.
It's an overwhelming sense of

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:31.232
loss, grief, misery,
a sense of shock too at God's

00:06:31.232 --> 00:06:34.033
treatment.
And also a longing to return,

00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:36.399
a longing for renewal and
reconciliation.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:40.539
The 200 years following the
destruction would prove to be a

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:43.680
time, a very critical time,
of transition.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.013
And Israelite literature in
this period reflects the

00:06:47.013 --> 00:06:50.673
Israelites' struggle with the
philosophical and religious

00:06:50.673 --> 00:06:52.829
challenge of the destruction.
 

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:55.129
How could the disastrous events
be explained?

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:58.699
We've already seen the response
of the Deuteronomistic School.

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.189
Israel was collectively
punished for idolatry.

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:04.990
We've seen that history simply
reflects justice on a national

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.459
and international level in this
view.

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:09.149
We've also seen the response of
Ezekiel.

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:13.325
He promoted the idea of a
continued relationship with God

00:07:13.325 --> 00:07:16.978
in exile and was awaiting a
fantastic restoration,

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.290
a redesign of human nature.
 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.589
We've seen the response of
Second Isaiah which emphasizes

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:25.417
the universal significance of
Israel's suffering,

00:07:25.417 --> 00:07:27.480
a universal mission for Israel.
 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.928
For both Ezekiel and the author
of Second Isaiah,

00:07:30.928 --> 00:07:35.310
Israel's suffering is serving a
purpose in the divine plan.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.412
It's necessary.
Israel needs purification and

00:07:38.412 --> 00:07:42.161
redemption and that will prepare
her for a new role in world

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:44.189
history.
But there are other responses

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:47.123
as well and they're found in the
material that's collected in the

00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:48.819
third section of the Hebrew
Bible.

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:51.277
That's the section referred to
really as Ketuvim,

00:07:51.277 --> 00:07:53.779
which in Hebrew simply means
writings, written things.

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:57.000
It's sort of a miscellany,
a catch-all phrase.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.192
And the final portion of the
course is going to be devoted

00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:00.269
now to that third section.
 

00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:03.538
So Torah, Neviim or
prophets, and Ketuvim,

00:08:03.538 --> 00:08:06.066
or writings.
Next time I'm going to discuss

00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:09.516
the problem of dating many of
the works that are in this third

00:08:09.516 --> 00:08:10.930
section, the Writings.
 

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.634
For now it'll suffice to say
that while some of the books in

00:08:14.634 --> 00:08:18.589
this third section of the Bible
may have pre-dated the exile,

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:22.230
they became canonical,
they became authoritative for

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.799
the community in the post-exilic
period and therefore served as a

00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:30.940
prism through which to view and
come to grips with Israel's

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.791
history.
So we're going to turn today,

00:08:33.791 --> 00:08:36.536
first of all,
to an examination of the three

00:08:36.536 --> 00:08:39.409
books that represent the Wisdom
tradition,

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.611
what's referred to as the
Wisdom literature,

00:08:41.611 --> 00:08:43.659
or Wisdom tradition in ancient
Israel.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.875
The Wisdom books of the Hebrew
Bible are Proverbs,

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:48.450
Job, and Ecclesiastes.
 

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:53.561
Israelite Wisdom literature
belongs to a much wider and

00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:59.240
broad Wisdom legacy or tradition
in the Ancient Near East.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.195
There's very little in biblical
Wisdom literature apart from its

00:09:03.195 --> 00:09:06.900
monotheism that lacks a parallel
in the Wisdom literature of

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.470
Egypt or Mesopotamia.
 

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.311
So Ancient Near Eastern Wisdom
literature is literature that's

00:09:12.311 --> 00:09:15.460
characterized by a praise of
human intelligence,

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.389
applied to understanding the
ways of the world,

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:19.789
the ways of society.
 

00:09:19.789 --> 00:09:23.928
It tends to contain traditional
advice--advice that's been found

00:09:23.928 --> 00:09:25.440
to be tried and true.
 

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.460
It tends to be very
individually oriented,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.216
but at the same time,
quite universal and humanistic

00:09:32.216 --> 00:09:34.500
in its orientation as well.
 

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.697
In keeping with this style,
Israelite Wisdom literature

00:09:37.697 --> 00:09:41.131
doesn't really speak to the
particular historical condition

00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:44.316
of Israel.
It speaks to the general human

00:09:44.316 --> 00:09:47.021
condition.
It makes no claim to having

00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:50.705
been divinely revealed--no
special claim to having been

00:09:50.705 --> 00:09:53.230
conveyed by a prophet or by
Moses.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.950
It's simply observational
wisdom;

00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:01.585
advice and counsel that can be
weighed or confirmed or disputed

00:10:01.585 --> 00:10:04.384
by experience.
Again, if you were simply to

00:10:04.384 --> 00:10:07.169
open up the Book of Proverbs and
read something in there,

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:10.106
unless it had the word Yahweh,
you wouldn't know that it

00:10:10.106 --> 00:10:12.830
didn't come from some Egyptian
Wisdom literature,

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.059
or Mesopotamian Wisdom
literature.

00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:17.490
There are various types of
Wisdom material.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.284
Scholars have classified the
Wisdom material into three main

00:10:21.284 --> 00:10:23.310
categories.
The Hebrew word for

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.818
wisdom--which is the word
hokhmah--literally means

00:10:26.818 --> 00:10:30.702
skill and probably refers to the
skill of living well or living

00:10:30.702 --> 00:10:33.021
properly.
The three types of Wisdom

00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:36.713
literature that we find are what
we could call (1) clan or family

00:10:36.713 --> 00:10:39.201
wisdom.
These materials tend to be

00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:42.067
common sense aphorisms and
observations,

00:10:42.067 --> 00:10:46.110
the kinds of things that are
common to all cultures.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.632
They're scattered around the
Hebrew Bible,

00:10:48.632 --> 00:10:52.139
but most of them are contained
in the Book of Proverbs.

00:10:52.139 --> 00:10:54.000
So, for example,
Proverbs 15:17,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.360
"Better a meal of vegetables
where there is love / Then a

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.580
fattened ox where there is
hate."

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.610
It's the kind of thing you can
imagine your grandmother saying.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.152
Chapter 20:14:
"'Bad, bad,' says the buyer,

00:11:05.152 --> 00:11:08.299
/ But having moved off,
he congratulates himself."

00:11:08.299 --> 00:11:12.107
Or 26:14: "The door turns on
its hinge, / And the lazy man on

00:11:12.107 --> 00:11:15.470
his bed," and neither of them
really gets anywhere.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:20.258
25:25: "Like cold water to a
parched throat / Is good news

00:11:20.258 --> 00:11:22.190
from a distant land."
 

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.488
Many of the Proverbs we
classify as clan or family

00:11:25.488 --> 00:11:26.970
wisdom are parental.
 

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.855
They tend to sound as if
they're being said to a son,

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:32.019
not so much a daughter,
but to a son.

00:11:32.019 --> 00:11:35.487
The second category of Wisdom
literature is what we call court

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:38.159
wisdom, and we have a lot of
this from Egypt.

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:40.647
A great deal of court wisdom
came from Egypt to serve the

00:11:40.647 --> 00:11:41.580
needs of the court.
 

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.146
It tends to be bureaucratic
advice, administrative advice,

00:11:45.146 --> 00:11:48.149
career advice,
instruction on manners or tact,

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:50.615
how to be diplomatic,
how to live well and

00:11:50.615 --> 00:11:52.299
prosper--practical wisdom.
 

00:11:52.299 --> 00:11:54.159
So, for example,
Proverbs 24:27,

00:11:54.159 --> 00:11:57.820
"Put your external affairs in
order, / Get ready what you have

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.700
in the field,
/ Then build yourself a home."

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.582
Or 21:23: "He who guards his
mouth and tongue / Guards

00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:08.947
himself from trouble," tact;
11:14, "For want of strategy an

00:12:08.947 --> 00:12:13.143
army falls, / But victory comes
with much planning," or 12:1,

00:12:13.143 --> 00:12:16.220
"He who loves discipline loves
knowledge;

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.029
/ He who spurns reproof is a
brutish man."

00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:22.706
Then the third category of
Wisdom literature is what we

00:12:22.706 --> 00:12:26.383
might call more free-wheeling
existential reflection or

00:12:26.383 --> 00:12:30.332
probing--a reflective probing
into the critical problems of

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:33.532
human existence,
and I'm going to talk about

00:12:33.532 --> 00:12:37.000
that in much more detail as we
get to the Book of Job.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.853
Now as I mentioned before,
all of these types of Wisdom

00:12:39.853 --> 00:12:42.020
literature tend to be very
universalistic,

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.500
humanistic, ahistorical.
 

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.610
There's nothing particularly
Israelite about them.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.284
There's no mention of the
exodus, there's no mention of

00:12:49.284 --> 00:12:52.207
Sinai or Moses or covenant or
any of the early narratives of

00:12:52.207 --> 00:12:54.334
the nation.
And they are paralleled in

00:12:54.334 --> 00:12:57.530
great abundance in the writings
of other Ancient Near Eastern

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.075
cultures.
Sometimes there's an attempt to

00:13:00.075 --> 00:13:03.210
connect wisdom specifically with
belief in Yahweh.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:07.072
But biblical Wisdom like
Ancient Near Eastern Wisdom

00:13:07.072 --> 00:13:11.692
generally grounds morality on
non-specific notions of prudence

00:13:11.692 --> 00:13:15.480
and God-fearing in a sort of
non-specific way,

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.450
rather then on the historical
covenant with Yahweh.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.955
So let's look at the Book of
Proverbs in a little more

00:13:23.955 --> 00:13:26.603
detail.
Proverbs is the classic book of

00:13:26.603 --> 00:13:29.049
Wisdom.
It contains some material of

00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:32.262
great antiquity.
Even though the book probably

00:13:32.262 --> 00:13:35.610
reached its final form only in
post-exilic times,

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.610
surely a great deal of it is
much older.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.396
There are many affinities
between Proverbs and Egyptian

00:13:42.396 --> 00:13:47.120
and Canaanite Wisdom literature,
so that suggests that Israel

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.799
assimilated Wisdom material from
the wider environment.

00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:56.931
The chief aim of Proverbs seems
to be the inculcation of wisdom

00:13:56.931 --> 00:14:01.399
as the means to social
tranquility and a happy life.

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:04.379
Young people should learn to
master their impulses.

00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:07.549
They should lead productive and
sensible lives.

00:14:07.549 --> 00:14:10.134
Many of the maxims are intended
to educate sons,

00:14:10.134 --> 00:14:12.279
there's no mention of daughters
here,

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:16.369
and a good deal of the first
nine chapters is formally

00:14:16.369 --> 00:14:19.070
pedagogical, clearly
pedagogical,

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.213
and can be compared quite
productively with some Egyptian

00:14:23.213 --> 00:14:27.652
writings that we have from the
third millennium--the Egyptian

00:14:27.652 --> 00:14:31.397
teaching of Amenemopet,
or the Babylonian Counsels of

00:14:31.397 --> 00:14:34.126
Wisdom;
tremendous parallels among

00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:37.105
these works.
But these first nine chapters

00:14:37.105 --> 00:14:40.751
warn against the seductions of
foreign women and they urge

00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:42.669
young men to pursue wisdom.
 

00:14:42.669 --> 00:14:46.256
And wisdom here is
figured--almost hypostasized,

00:14:46.256 --> 00:14:49.994
an attribute or a
characteristic that's almost put

00:14:49.994 --> 00:14:54.508
into a concrete human form,
wisdom is figured as a virtuous

00:14:54.508 --> 00:14:57.279
woman who promises insight and
counsel.

00:14:57.279 --> 00:15:00.690
This woman was created before
all other created things.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.682
And wisdom again,
figured as a woman,

00:15:02.682 --> 00:15:05.338
assisted Yahweh in the
creation--in the ordering,

00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:07.940
I should say,
the ordering of the universe.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.210
Wisdom was with God at that
time.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.837
Proverbs values hard work and
diligence, and warns against

00:15:14.837 --> 00:15:17.759
excessive sleep and sex,
and wine.

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:21.202
Proverbs recommends honesty in
your business affairs and

00:15:21.202 --> 00:15:23.392
kindness, and loyalty,
impartiality,

00:15:23.392 --> 00:15:26.710
sobriety, and humility,
restraint, and sincerity.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.038
Wealth is very nice,
but it's not to be desired at

00:15:30.038 --> 00:15:32.279
the cost of calmness and peace.
 

00:15:32.279 --> 00:15:35.804
The Wisdom sayings that appear
in Proverbs are usually these

00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:38.970
short two-line sentences in
which the second line runs

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.240
parallel in some way to the
first.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.687
Some scholars have classified
the different kinds of

00:15:43.687 --> 00:15:46.758
parallelism you find in the book
of Proverbs and I've written the

00:15:46.758 --> 00:15:48.149
three main forms up here.
 

00:15:48.149 --> 00:15:50.820
An example of synonymous
parallelism, where the second

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.893
line is essentially synonymous
with the first--that's found in

00:15:53.893 --> 00:15:55.993
Proverbs 22:1.
It's a classic feature of

00:15:55.993 --> 00:15:57.330
biblical poetry in general.
 

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.139
We'll see it in the Psalms.
 

00:15:59.139 --> 00:16:02.067
For an example,
"A good name is to be chosen

00:16:02.067 --> 00:16:04.789
rather then great riches / And
favor,"

00:16:04.789 --> 00:16:07.578
parallel to a good name,
"is better then silver and

00:16:07.578 --> 00:16:09.529
gold," parallel to great riches
.

00:16:09.529 --> 00:16:12.179
So the two lines are somewhat
synonymous.

00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:16.539
In antithetic parallelism the
two lines form a balanced pair

00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:19.200
of opposites,
so in Proverbs 10:1,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.312
"A wise son makes a glad father
/ But a foolish son is a sorrow

00:16:23.312 --> 00:16:26.560
to his mother".
When the second line seems to

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.583
complete the thought of the
first, it's called ascending

00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:34.403
parallelism.
We find that in Proverbs 11:22,

00:16:34.403 --> 00:16:39.762
"Like a gold ring in the snout
of a pig / Is a beautiful woman

00:16:39.762 --> 00:16:41.519
bereft of sense."
 

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:45.797
Another feature of Proverbs is
that wisdom itself is

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:48.899
established as a religious
concept.

00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:50.889
It seems to have some religious
value.

00:16:50.889 --> 00:16:54.695
Proverbs tries to link wisdom
with reverence for God and

00:16:54.695 --> 00:16:56.009
obedience to God.
 

00:16:56.009 --> 00:16:58.298
In Proverbs 1:7,
"The fear of the Lord" or

00:16:58.298 --> 00:17:01.759
reverence, "the fear of the Lord
is the beginning of wisdom.

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:05.294
Fools despise wisdom and
discipline," or chapter 3:5-8,

00:17:05.294 --> 00:17:09.157
"Trust in the Lord with all
your heart, / And do not rely on

00:17:09.157 --> 00:17:10.990
your own understanding."
 

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.888
Wisdom guards one from evil,
the wise person accepts the

00:17:14.888 --> 00:17:18.289
sufferings with which God is
disciplining him.

00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:21.476
So in Proverbs 3:12,
"For Yahweh reproves," or

00:17:21.476 --> 00:17:24.663
disciplines, "him whom he loves
/ As a father,

00:17:24.663 --> 00:17:27.000
the son in whom he delights".
 

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.082
Keep that in mind as we turn to
Job, because I think the most

00:17:31.082 --> 00:17:35.165
important thing about the Book
of Proverbs is its almost smug

00:17:35.165 --> 00:17:39.452
certainty that the righteous and
the wicked of the world receive

00:17:39.452 --> 00:17:41.970
what they deserve in this life.
 

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.430
There's a complacency here,
an optimism.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.665
God's just providence and a
moral world order,

00:17:48.665 --> 00:17:52.980
are presuppositions that it
just doesn't seem to question.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.169
The wise person's deeds are
good and will bring him

00:17:56.169 --> 00:17:57.700
happiness and success.
 

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.205
The foolish person's deeds are
evil and they are going to lead

00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:02.470
to failure and ruin.
 

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:06.223
The key idea is that a truly
wise person knows that the world

00:18:06.223 --> 00:18:07.850
is essentially coherent.
 

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.210
It's ethically ordered.
 

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.557
There are clear laws of reward
and punishment that exist in the

00:18:12.557 --> 00:18:15.150
world.
Proverbs 26:27;

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.906
"He who digs a pit will fall
into it / and a stone will come

00:18:18.906 --> 00:18:21.390
back upon him who starts it
rolling".

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.438
Or 13:6: "Righteousness
protects him whose way is

00:18:24.438 --> 00:18:27.640
blameless;
Wickedness subverts the sinner."

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.019
If the righteous suffer then
they are being chastised or

00:18:31.019 --> 00:18:34.829
chastened by God just as a son
is disciplined by his father.

00:18:34.829 --> 00:18:37.640
He shouldn't reject this
reproof, he should welcome it.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.667
This insistence,
on the basic justice of the

00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:45.032
world, and the power of wisdom
or fear of the Lord to guarantee

00:18:45.032 --> 00:18:48.904
success and security was one
strand of ancient Israelite

00:18:48.904 --> 00:18:51.436
thought.
It reaches crystallization in

00:18:51.436 --> 00:18:52.609
the Book of Proverbs.
 

00:18:52.609 --> 00:18:56.577
It was available as a response
to or an explanation of the

00:18:56.577 --> 00:18:59.640
catastrophes that had befallen
the nation.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.149
We've seen it at work in the
Deuteronomistic school,

00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:07.072
unwilling to relinquish the
idea of a moral God in control

00:19:07.072 --> 00:19:10.994
of history and preferring to
infer the nation's sinfulness

00:19:10.994 --> 00:19:13.609
from its suffering and calamity.
 

00:19:13.609 --> 00:19:17.792
Better to blame the sufferer
Israel and so keep God and the

00:19:17.792 --> 00:19:21.109
system of divine retributive
justice intact.

00:19:21.109 --> 00:19:24.694
But it's precisely this
formulaic and conventional piety

00:19:24.694 --> 00:19:28.670
that is challenged by two other
remarkable Wisdom books in the

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.319
Bible: the Book of Job and the
Book of Ecclesiastes.

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:35.536
In Job we find the idea that
suffering is not always

00:19:35.536 --> 00:19:37.550
punitive.
It is not always a sign of

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.680
wickedness.
It's not always explicable.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.542
And this is the first of
several subversions of

00:19:43.542 --> 00:19:47.462
fundamental biblical principles
that we encounter in the Book of

00:19:47.462 --> 00:19:49.774
Job.
The Book of Job--we really

00:19:49.774 --> 00:19:51.240
don't know its date.
 

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.055
It's probably no earlier then
the sixth century BCE,

00:19:54.055 --> 00:19:57.479
but scholars disagree and there
are portions of it that seem to

00:19:57.479 --> 00:20:00.240
reflect a very old and very
ancient tradition.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.568
It's one of the hardest books
of the Bible for moderns to

00:20:03.568 --> 00:20:07.253
read, and I think that's because
its conclusions--to the degree

00:20:07.253 --> 00:20:10.463
that we can agree on what the
conclusions might be--its

00:20:10.463 --> 00:20:13.911
conclusions seem to fly in the
face of some basic religious

00:20:13.911 --> 00:20:16.673
convictions.
You have to allow yourself,

00:20:16.673 --> 00:20:19.180
I think, to be surprised,
to open your mind,

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.970
to allow yourself to take Job's
charges against God seriously.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:27.432
After all, the narrator makes
it clear that God does take them

00:20:27.432 --> 00:20:30.117
seriously.
God nowhere denies Job's

00:20:30.117 --> 00:20:33.883
charges and, in fact,
at one point the narrator has

00:20:33.883 --> 00:20:36.670
God say that Job has spoken
truly.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:40.488
So no matter how uncomfortable
Job may make you feel,

00:20:40.488 --> 00:20:44.599
you need to understand his
claims and not condemn him.

00:20:44.599 --> 00:20:48.354
Job is going to attack the
optimistic conventional piety

00:20:48.354 --> 00:20:51.289
that is typified in the Book of
Proverbs.

00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:54.256
He's going to challenge the
assumption that there is a moral

00:20:54.256 --> 00:20:56.817
world order.
The issues that are raised in

00:20:56.817 --> 00:21:00.149
this book are twofold:
first, why God permits blatant

00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:03.608
injustice and undeserved
suffering and evil to exist in

00:21:03.608 --> 00:21:05.898
the world,
and second of all,

00:21:05.898 --> 00:21:10.180
whether people will be virtuous
when they are afflicted and

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.009
suffering.
In other words,

00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:15.312
are people righteous only
because God will reward them for

00:21:15.312 --> 00:21:17.169
it,
or are they righteous because

00:21:17.169 --> 00:21:19.980
of the intrinsic and inherent
value of righteousness?

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.690
Those are the two issues.
 

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:25.394
Now literarily,
the book contains two primary

00:21:25.394 --> 00:21:27.972
elements.
First, we have a prose story

00:21:27.972 --> 00:21:30.451
and that provides a framework
for the book,

00:21:30.451 --> 00:21:33.934
that's chapters 1 and 2 and
then it returns in chapter 42 at

00:21:33.934 --> 00:21:35.410
the end of the book.
 

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:41.701
Into this prose framework a
large poetic section of dialogue

00:21:41.701 --> 00:21:45.220
and speeches has been inserted.
 

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.509
So there are two main literary
components.

00:21:47.509 --> 00:21:51.403
Now the prose framework
concerning a scrupulously

00:21:51.403 --> 00:21:55.215
righteous man named Job,
afflicted by horrendous

00:21:55.215 --> 00:21:57.887
calamity,
was probably a standard Ancient

00:21:57.887 --> 00:22:00.080
Near Eastern folktale of great
antiquity.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.790
The story isn't set in Israel;
it's not about an Israelite.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.289
It's set in Edom.
 

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:08.107
Job is an eastern magnate who
dwells in the country of Uz,

00:22:08.107 --> 00:22:09.380
not an Israelite.
 

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.227
But the Israelite author has
used this older Ancient Near

00:22:13.227 --> 00:22:17.349
Eastern legend about a man named
Job for his own purposes.

00:22:17.349 --> 00:22:20.312
The name Job,
which in Hebrew is pronounced,

00:22:20.312 --> 00:22:23.000
iyyov,
is bivalent in meaning.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.029
It can mean "enemy" in Hebrew,
by changing vowels around;

00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:30.008
but it's the root for enemy,
oyev, or,

00:22:30.008 --> 00:22:33.730
if we take it in Aramaic,
it can mean "one who repents,"

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.220
"a repentant one."
 

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.036
And as we're going to see,
the name will be appropriate in

00:22:39.036 --> 00:22:41.579
both senses as the story
progresses.

00:22:41.579 --> 00:22:43.400
There's a handout on the side
of the room.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.059
I'm not sure everyone took one
when they came in.

00:22:45.059 --> 00:22:47.039
I'm wondering if it could be
distributed please.

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:48.800
I'm sorry.
It's going to help you chart

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.819
what goes on in Job.
 

00:22:49.819 --> 00:22:53.275
But this handout contains an
outline of the book's structure

00:22:53.275 --> 00:22:55.970
on one side--so it's mapped out
on one side.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.872
On the other side,
it has some important verses

00:22:58.872 --> 00:23:01.855
and terms.
But we'll see from the outline

00:23:01.855 --> 00:23:05.045
of the structure,
chapters 1 and 2 have this

00:23:05.045 --> 00:23:09.198
prose prologue about the pious
and prosperous Job and his

00:23:09.198 --> 00:23:12.039
devastation,
which is the result of a

00:23:12.039 --> 00:23:14.079
challenge which is put to God.
 

00:23:14.079 --> 00:23:17.484
At the end of that prologue,
at the end of chapter 2,

00:23:17.484 --> 00:23:21.347
he has three friends who come
to sit with him in silence for

00:23:21.347 --> 00:23:24.214
seven days.
The silence doesn't last very

00:23:24.214 --> 00:23:27.982
long because we move then into
the large poetic section and

00:23:27.982 --> 00:23:31.425
that extends from chapter 3 all
the way to chapter 42,

00:23:31.425 --> 00:23:34.348
verse 7.
So you'll see that structure on

00:23:34.348 --> 00:23:37.704
the handout.
There are many ways to map the

00:23:37.704 --> 00:23:40.190
structure of the Book of Job.
 

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:44.018
Your handout charts,
I think, one of the more common

00:23:44.018 --> 00:23:46.269
and clearer representations.
 

00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:49.431
Looking now specifically at the
poetic section:

00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:52.936
First, you have a dialogue
between Job and his three

00:23:52.936 --> 00:23:56.097
friends that goes from chapter 3
to chapter 31,

00:23:56.097 --> 00:23:58.809
verse40.
And it can be divided into

00:23:58.809 --> 00:24:00.559
three cycles of speeches.
 

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:03.862
Job opens each cycle--so the
first speech in each cycle is by

00:24:03.862 --> 00:24:06.890
Job--and then his friends speak
in a regular pattern.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.446
First, Eliphaz with Job
responding and then Bildad with

00:24:10.446 --> 00:24:14.033
Job responding and then Zophar;
and you have this pattern of

00:24:14.033 --> 00:24:16.853
six speeches.
It occurs three times but in

00:24:16.853 --> 00:24:21.230
fact the third time the reply by
Zophar is omitted and that

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:25.910
deviation ensures that Job has
the first and the last word.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:30.410
He has a summation speech in
chapters 29 to 31.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.868
At first, the friends seek to
comfort Job and to explain his

00:24:34.868 --> 00:24:38.420
suffering but they become
increasingly harsh,

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.920
ultimately bearing a callous
contempt for Job's condition.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.706
Now this section closes with
the long speech by Job,

00:24:46.706 --> 00:24:48.339
as I said: 29 to 31.
 

00:24:48.339 --> 00:24:51.210
He's lamenting the loss of his
past, pleasant life.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.720
He protests his innocence,
he calls on God to answer.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.761
But then Elihu,
this previously unannounced

00:24:57.761 --> 00:24:59.500
fourth friend appears.
 

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.850
He gives four speeches from
chapters32 to 37.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:06.214
He admonishes Job;
he defends God's justice,

00:25:06.214 --> 00:25:11.261
and then this is followed by a
poetic discourse between God who

00:25:11.261 --> 00:25:15.900
poses a series of rhetorical
questions and Job who appears

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.648
contrite.
And that section also falls

00:25:18.648 --> 00:25:21.269
into four parts rather like
Elihu's speech.

00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:25.730
You have two long speeches by
Yahweh, two short ones by Job.

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.787
Finally, there's a concluding
prose epilogue that vindicates

00:25:29.787 --> 00:25:32.243
Job.
God criticizes Job's friends,

00:25:32.243 --> 00:25:35.342
and then in a rather unexpected
happy ending,

00:25:35.342 --> 00:25:38.654
we have Job restored to his
fortunes and finally

00:25:38.654 --> 00:25:41.119
experiencing a peaceful death.
 

00:25:41.119 --> 00:25:43.852
So let's look at the contents
in greater deal now that we've

00:25:43.852 --> 00:25:45.009
reviewed the structure.
 

00:25:45.009 --> 00:25:47.640
The story opens by introducing
us to Job.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.069
He's said to be a blameless and
upright man.

00:25:50.069 --> 00:25:53.242
He fears God and he shuns evil,
that is chapter 1,

00:25:53.242 --> 00:25:55.414
verse 1.
So the moral virtue and

00:25:55.414 --> 00:25:59.059
innocence of Job is established
in the opening line as a

00:25:59.059 --> 00:26:01.777
narrative fact,
a non-negotiable narrative

00:26:01.777 --> 00:26:04.129
fact.
And yet this Job is to become

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:07.624
the victim of a challenge issued
by "the satan" in the

00:26:07.624 --> 00:26:08.789
heavenly counsel.
 

00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:10.960
I say "the satan" deliberately.
 

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.220
The satan.
 

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.109
The satan is certainly not the
devil.

00:26:14.109 --> 00:26:16.829
There's no such notion in the
Hebrew Bible.

00:26:16.829 --> 00:26:21.323
The phrase, "the satan," occurs
four times in the Hebrew Bible,

00:26:21.323 --> 00:26:24.440
here and in Numbers 22 and in
Zechariah3.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.406
"The satan" is simply a
member of the divine

00:26:27.406 --> 00:26:30.491
counsel--one of God's minions
whose function it is to

00:26:30.491 --> 00:26:34.230
investigate affairs on earth and
to act as a kind of prosecuting

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.148
attorney.
He has to bring evildoers to

00:26:37.148 --> 00:26:39.279
justice.
And it's only in later Jewish,

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:42.039
and especially Christian
thought, that the term loses the

00:26:42.039 --> 00:26:44.850
definite article--from "the
satan" which means "the

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.429
prosecutor" essentially,
the prosecuting attorney--and

00:26:48.429 --> 00:26:52.358
becomes a proper name,
Satan, for an enemy or opponent

00:26:52.358 --> 00:26:55.268
of God.
This later concept of Satan

00:26:55.268 --> 00:26:58.882
develops as a means of
explaining evil without

00:26:58.882 --> 00:27:02.599
attributing it to God,
but that isn't the function of

00:27:02.599 --> 00:27:03.910
the satan here.
 

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.793
He works for God and when
Yahweh boasts of his pious

00:27:07.793 --> 00:27:11.220
servant Job, the prosecuting
angel wonders,

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.416
as his portfolio requires him
to do, whether Job's piety is

00:27:15.416 --> 00:27:17.490
sincere.
Perhaps he's motivated by

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.125
self-interest.
Since he's been blessed with

00:27:20.125 --> 00:27:24.232
such good fortune and prosperity
he's naturally enough pious and

00:27:24.232 --> 00:27:27.107
righteous,
but would his piety survive

00:27:27.107 --> 00:27:29.059
affliction and suffering?
 

00:27:29.059 --> 00:27:33.079
Deprived of his wealth wouldn't
he curse God to his face?

00:27:33.079 --> 00:27:36.041
You have to notice as you're
reading the euphemistic use of

00:27:36.041 --> 00:27:37.930
"bless God" instead of "curse
God."

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.176
The ancient writers did not
want to write down "curse God"

00:27:40.176 --> 00:27:42.644
so they wrote "bless God,"
but we need to understand

00:27:42.644 --> 00:27:45.809
that's a euphemistic way of
avoiding writing "curse God."

00:27:45.809 --> 00:27:48.289
So wouldn't he curse God to his
face?

00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:51.821
God is quite confident that
Job's piety is not superficial,

00:27:51.821 --> 00:27:54.440
it's not driven by the desire
for reward,

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.412
and so he permits the
satan to put Job to the

00:27:57.412 --> 00:27:59.271
test.
Job's children are killed,

00:27:59.271 --> 00:28:02.230
his cattle are destroyed,
his property is destroyed,

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:06.295
but Job's response in chapter
1:21 is, "Naked I came from my

00:28:06.295 --> 00:28:09.119
mother's womb and naked I shall
return;

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:13.269
God gives and God takes away,
may the name of the Lord be

00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:15.581
blessed.
The narrator then adds in verse

00:28:15.581 --> 00:28:18.775
22, "In all this--," and if you
flip over I've got some of these

00:28:18.775 --> 00:28:22.069
key verses on the back of your
handout to help you keep track,

00:28:22.069 --> 00:28:27.459
"In all this Job did not sin or
impute anything unsavory to

00:28:27.459 --> 00:28:30.219
God."
And God again praises Job to

00:28:30.219 --> 00:28:33.761
the satan,
saying, "And still he holds on

00:28:33.761 --> 00:28:37.152
to his integrity,
so you incited me to destroy

00:28:37.152 --> 00:28:38.810
him for nothing."
 

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:40.609
That's chapter 2:3.
 

00:28:40.609 --> 00:28:43.511
So the satan proposes
increasing the suffering,

00:28:43.511 --> 00:28:46.960
and God agrees on the condition
that Job's life be preserved.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.655
So the satan strikes
Job's body with these terrible

00:28:50.655 --> 00:28:53.508
painful sores,
trying to crush his spirit and

00:28:53.508 --> 00:28:56.784
Job's wife rages,
"Do you still hold on to your

00:28:56.784 --> 00:28:59.994
integrity?
Bless God," curse God "and

00:28:59.994 --> 00:29:01.809
die," chapter 2:9.
 

00:29:01.809 --> 00:29:04.632
But still Job will not sin,
he will not curse God,

00:29:04.632 --> 00:29:07.569
he insists on remaining
virtuous and he responds,

00:29:07.569 --> 00:29:11.005
"Shall we receive good at the
hand of God and shall we not

00:29:11.005 --> 00:29:13.589
receive evil?"
So at first glance it would

00:29:13.589 --> 00:29:16.049
appear that Job accepts his
bitter fate.

00:29:16.049 --> 00:29:18.695
But note: after the first round
of suffering,

00:29:18.695 --> 00:29:22.243
the narrator observed that "in
all this Job did not sin with

00:29:22.243 --> 00:29:25.190
his lips or impute anything
unsavory to God,"

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.917
but now he merely observes,
"in all this Job did not sin

00:29:28.917 --> 00:29:31.841
with his lips."
Not with his lips perhaps,

00:29:31.841 --> 00:29:35.589
but in his heart did he impute
unsavory things to God?

00:29:35.589 --> 00:29:40.113
If we were to move directly to
the conclusion of the folktale

00:29:40.113 --> 00:29:42.976
in chapter 42,
if we jump from this point just

00:29:42.976 --> 00:29:45.595
to the conclusion,
in 42:7 is where the conclusion

00:29:45.595 --> 00:29:47.687
begins,
we would find that Job is

00:29:47.687 --> 00:29:51.425
rewarded fully for his patience
and steadfast loyalty and his

00:29:51.425 --> 00:29:55.349
household and his belongings are
restored to him twice over.

00:29:55.349 --> 00:30:00.138
The folktale standing alone
could be read as the story of an

00:30:00.138 --> 00:30:03.710
innocent man tested,
who accepts his fate.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:06.650
He retains his faith,
and he's rewarded.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.073
Standing alone,
the tale appears to reflect the

00:30:09.073 --> 00:30:12.077
values and the conventional
piety of the Wisdom literature

00:30:12.077 --> 00:30:14.079
and of the Deuteronomistic
school.

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:16.630
But the folktale doesn't stand
alone.

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:20.290
The anonymous author of Job
uses this earlier legend

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:25.099
concerning the righteous man Job
as a frame for his own purposes,

00:30:25.099 --> 00:30:28.960
and the hint at the end of the
prologue that Job perhaps is

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.888
beginning to impute unsavory
things to God points forward to

00:30:32.888 --> 00:30:36.349
this extensive poetic dialogue
that's following.

00:30:36.349 --> 00:30:40.579
Here are Job's unsavory
accusations against God.

00:30:40.579 --> 00:30:44.284
Here we have a most impatient
and furious Job who will charge

00:30:44.284 --> 00:30:47.989
God with gross mismanagement of
the world and eventually deny

00:30:47.989 --> 00:30:50.829
the existence of a moral order
altogether.

00:30:50.829 --> 00:30:54.629
So reading the Book of Job is a
fascinating exercise because the

00:30:54.629 --> 00:30:56.799
two types of material in the
book,

00:30:56.799 --> 00:30:59.998
the prose frame and the poetic
dialogue in the middle,

00:30:59.998 --> 00:31:01.869
they appear to be in tension.
 

00:31:01.869 --> 00:31:04.127
And yet interwoven,
as they are now,

00:31:04.127 --> 00:31:08.319
they work together and the one
shapes our reading of the other.

00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:11.400
Our reception of the
accusations of Job's friends in

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.481
the poetic dialogue--our
reception of those words is

00:31:14.481 --> 00:31:17.682
determined by the prose
framework's assertion that Job

00:31:17.682 --> 00:31:20.150
is innocent.
That's a non-negotiable

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:23.930
narrative fact and because of
the fact of Job's righteousness,

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:27.385
we know Job's friends are lying
when they say Job must be

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:29.359
suffering for some hidden sin.
 

00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:31.350
And we know that Job's
self-defense,

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.250
that he hasn't deserved the
suffering is correct.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.453
We're going to rehearse some of
the arguments that are advanced

00:31:37.453 --> 00:31:39.811
in the central core,
the poetic core of the book,

00:31:39.811 --> 00:31:41.687
and here I think a helpful
guide through the

00:31:41.687 --> 00:31:44.480
arguments--there are lots of
commentaries on the Book of Job,

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.584
but one commentary that I think
is helpful in just sort of

00:31:47.584 --> 00:31:50.688
working through some of the
arguments of the interlocutors

00:31:50.688 --> 00:31:52.539
is the analysis of Edwin Good.
 

00:31:52.539 --> 00:31:56.954
Although Job doesn't exactly
curse God in his first speech,

00:31:56.954 --> 00:31:59.769
he does curse the day of his
birth.

00:31:59.769 --> 00:32:02.917
And in a passage that alludes
repeatedly to creation,

00:32:02.917 --> 00:32:06.670
Job essentially curses all that
God has accomplished as creator

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.120
of the cosmos.
He wishes he were dead,

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.549
and at this point he doesn't
even ask why this has happened

00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:15.979
to him, he only asks why he
should be alive when he prefers

00:32:15.979 --> 00:32:18.917
death.
Eliphaz's reply is long and

00:32:18.917 --> 00:32:22.069
elaborate.
He seems to offer comfort.

00:32:22.069 --> 00:32:24.998
He seems to offer
comfort, until he injects a new

00:32:24.998 --> 00:32:28.299
element in the discussion and
that's the element of justice.

00:32:28.299 --> 00:32:32.226
Job hasn't mentioned the issue
of justice up to this point,

00:32:32.226 --> 00:32:35.341
but Eliphaz says,
"Think now, what innocent man

00:32:35.341 --> 00:32:38.118
ever perished?
/ Where have the upright been

00:32:38.118 --> 00:32:39.854
destroyed?
/ As I have seen,

00:32:39.854 --> 00:32:43.693
those who plow evil / And sow
mischief reap them," chapter

00:32:43.693 --> 00:32:45.924
4:7-8.
So Eliphaz is handing Job the

00:32:45.924 --> 00:32:49.285
standard line of biblical Wisdom
literature as exemplified by

00:32:49.285 --> 00:32:51.470
something like the book of
Proverbs,

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:55.413
belief in a system of divine
retributive justice--that

00:32:55.413 --> 00:32:57.049
retribution is just.
 

00:32:57.049 --> 00:33:00.890
By definition there can be no
undeserved suffering.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:04.033
The implication is that Job has
deserved this suffering--a

00:33:04.033 --> 00:33:07.011
thought that apparently hadn't
occurred to Job--and the

00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:10.320
question of undeserved suffering
is now going to dominate the

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.920
rest of the discussion.
 

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.819
Job's second speech is very
disorderly.

00:33:13.819 --> 00:33:16.535
It's full of wildly
contradictory images that may

00:33:16.535 --> 00:33:19.987
reflect the shock and the pain
and the rage that now overwhelm

00:33:19.987 --> 00:33:21.827
him.
He seems to be haunted by

00:33:21.827 --> 00:33:24.991
Eliphaz's connection of his
suffering with some sin and so

00:33:24.991 --> 00:33:26.990
he turns to address God
directly.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.776
He admits he's not perfect but
surely, he objects,

00:33:29.776 --> 00:33:31.880
he doesn't deserve such
affliction.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.837
In chapter 8 we have Bildad's
speech and it's tactless and

00:33:36.837 --> 00:33:39.622
unkind.
He says, "Will God pervert the

00:33:39.622 --> 00:33:41.372
right?
/ Will the Almighty pervert

00:33:41.372 --> 00:33:43.148
justice?
/ If your sons sinned against

00:33:43.148 --> 00:33:45.940
Him, / He dispatched them for
their transgressions," 8:3-4.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.041
In other words,
God is perfectly just and

00:33:48.041 --> 00:33:50.089
ultimately all get what they
deserve.

00:33:50.089 --> 00:33:53.193
Indeed, your children,
Job, must have died because

00:33:53.193 --> 00:33:56.740
they sinned, so just search for
God and ask for mercy.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:01.055
The friends' speeches lead Job
to the conclusion that God must

00:34:01.055 --> 00:34:03.390
be indifferent to moral status.
 

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:06.940
God doesn't follow the rules
that he demands of human beings.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.533
This is chapter 9:22,
"He finishes off both perfect

00:34:10.533 --> 00:34:12.944
and wicked."
When Job complains,

00:34:12.944 --> 00:34:16.272
"He wounds me much for
nothing," chapter 9:17,

00:34:16.272 --> 00:34:20.264
he's echoing God's own words to
the satan in the

00:34:20.264 --> 00:34:22.806
prologue.
Remember when God says to the

00:34:22.806 --> 00:34:26.079
satan you have "incited
me to destroy him for nothing,"

00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:30.659
and we suspect by this verbal
coincidence that Job is right.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:33.948
Legal terms dominate,
as Job calls for the charges

00:34:33.948 --> 00:34:36.968
against him to be published,
and then he hurls

00:34:36.968 --> 00:34:39.719
countercharges in a suit against
God.

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:43.267
Charges of unworthy conduct,
of spurning his creatures while

00:34:43.267 --> 00:34:46.644
smiling on the wicked,
on scrutinizing Job even though

00:34:46.644 --> 00:34:50.326
he knows Job to be innocent,
and this too is a subversion of

00:34:50.326 --> 00:34:53.384
a common prophetic literary
genre that we've seen:

00:34:53.384 --> 00:34:57.253
the riv or the covenant
lawsuit in which God through his

00:34:57.253 --> 00:35:00.935
prophets charges Israel with
flagrant violation of the terms

00:35:00.935 --> 00:35:04.679
of the covenant and warns of
inevitable punishment.

00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:08.278
Here, in Job,
it's a man who arraigns God and

00:35:08.278 --> 00:35:11.794
yet, Job asserts,
since God is God and not a

00:35:11.794 --> 00:35:15.401
human adversary,
there's really no fair way for

00:35:15.401 --> 00:35:18.820
the lawsuit between them to be
tried or arbitrated.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:22.010
"Man cannot win a suit against
God," chapter 9:2.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:25.159
Job is powerless in the face of
this injustice.

00:35:25.159 --> 00:35:30.180
These ideas all find expression
in Job 10:1-7:

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:33.546
I am disgusted with life;
I will give rein to my

00:35:33.546 --> 00:35:36.101
complaint,
Speak in the bitterness of my

00:35:36.101 --> 00:35:37.479
soul.
I say to God,

00:35:37.479 --> 00:35:40.885
"Do not condemn men;
Let me know what You charge me

00:35:40.885 --> 00:35:43.309
with.
Does it benefit You to defraud,

00:35:43.309 --> 00:35:45.639
To despise the toil of Your
hands,

00:35:45.639 --> 00:35:47.570
While smiling on the counsel of
the wicked?

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.660
Do You have the eyes of flesh?
 

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.920
Is Your vision that of mere men?
 

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.389
Are Your days the days of a
mortal?

00:35:54.389 --> 00:35:55.940
Are Your years the years of a
man,

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.990
That You seek my inequity
And search out my sin?

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:02.403
You know that I am not guilty,
And that there is none to

00:36:02.403 --> 00:36:06.229
deliver from Your hand…
Job repeats his wish to die,

00:36:06.229 --> 00:36:10.126
this time less because of his
suffering and more because his

00:36:10.126 --> 00:36:11.909
worldview has collapsed.
 

00:36:11.909 --> 00:36:16.681
He sees that divine power is
utterly divorced from justice

00:36:16.681 --> 00:36:22.039
and that's a second fundamental
biblical assumption subverted.

00:36:22.039 --> 00:36:25.900
But Job's words only seem to
egg his interlocutors on.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.670
Eliphaz had implied that Job
was a sinner.

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.958
Bildad had baldly asserted that
his sons had died for their sins

00:36:31.958 --> 00:36:35.142
and now Zophar's going to claim
that actually Job is suffering

00:36:35.142 --> 00:36:36.500
less then he deserves.
 

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.409
And Job isn't persuaded.
 

00:36:38.409 --> 00:36:40.734
He isn't persuaded that he has
sinned or more precisely,

00:36:40.734 --> 00:36:42.932
that he has sinned in
proportion to the punishment he

00:36:42.932 --> 00:36:43.820
is now suffering.
 

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.159
God is simply unjust.
 

00:36:46.159 --> 00:36:50.899
The Job of this poetic dialogue
portion of the book is hardly

00:36:50.899 --> 00:36:52.400
patient or pious.
 

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.408
He is angry,
he is violent,

00:36:54.408 --> 00:36:58.578
he argues, he complains and
vehemently insists upon his

00:36:58.578 --> 00:37:01.230
innocence.
In the fourth speech by

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:05.123
Job--now this is the speech that
opens the second cycle of

00:37:05.123 --> 00:37:07.650
speeches--Job appeals to
creation.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:12.440
God's controlling power is
arbitrary and unprincipled.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.198
He interferes with the natural
order, he interferes with the

00:37:16.198 --> 00:37:19.893
human order, and this is itself
a subversion of the Genesis

00:37:19.893 --> 00:37:23.460
portrait of creation as a
process whose goal and crown is

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.590
humankind.
Again, Job demands a trial.

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:31.190
He demands a trial in the
widely quoted and mistranslated

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:34.340
verse--this is Job 13:15:
"He may well slay me.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:38.929
I may have no hope-- but I must
argue my case before Him."

00:37:38.929 --> 00:37:41.298
In other words,
Job knows that he can't win but

00:37:41.298 --> 00:37:43.050
he still wants his day in court.
 

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:45.989
He wants to make his accusation
of God's mismanagement.

00:37:45.989 --> 00:37:49.462
He wants to voice his protest
even though he knows it will

00:37:49.462 --> 00:37:50.619
gain him nothing.
 

00:37:50.619 --> 00:37:52.852
In a pun on his name,
Iyyov,

00:37:52.852 --> 00:37:55.477
Job asks God,
"Why do You hide Your face,

00:37:55.477 --> 00:37:57.710
/ And treat me like an enemy?"
 

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:01.469
,treat me like an oyev,
13:28.

00:38:01.469 --> 00:38:05.282
In his second speech Job fully
expects to be murdered,

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:08.304
not executed,
but murdered by God and hopes

00:38:08.304 --> 00:38:12.621
only that the evidence of his
murder will not be concealed he

00:38:12.621 --> 00:38:16.610
says in 16:18,
"Earth, do not cover my blood" .

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:20.326
Job's third speech reiterates
this desire, the desire that the

00:38:20.326 --> 00:38:22.579
wrong against him not be
forgotten.

00:38:22.579 --> 00:38:24.987
"Would that my words were
written, would that they were

00:38:24.987 --> 00:38:29.261
engraved in an inscription,
with an iron stylus and lead,

00:38:29.261 --> 00:38:33.989
forever in rock they were
incised," 19:23-24.

00:38:33.989 --> 00:38:38.190
Job's three speeches in the
second cycle become increasingly

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:42.676
emotional and for their part the
speeches of his friends in this

00:38:42.676 --> 00:38:45.239
cycle become increasingly cruel.
 

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:50.539
Their insistence that suffering
is always a sure sign of sin

00:38:50.539 --> 00:38:55.750
seems to justify hostility
towards and contempt for Job.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.248
He's now depicted as
universally mocked and

00:38:58.248 --> 00:39:00.449
humiliated and despised and
abused.

00:39:00.449 --> 00:39:04.782
One cannot help but see in this
characterization of Job's

00:39:04.782 --> 00:39:08.050
so-called friends,
an incisive commentary on the

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:10.780
callous human propensity to
blame the victim,

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.429
and to do so lest our tidy and
comfortable picture of a moral

00:39:14.429 --> 00:39:17.349
universe in which the righteous
do not suffer,

00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:21.190
should come apart at the seams
as Job's has.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:25.123
Job opens the third cycle of
speeches urging his friends to

00:39:25.123 --> 00:39:28.718
look, to really see his
situation, because if they did

00:39:28.718 --> 00:39:30.550
they would be appalled.
 

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.888
Job's situation looked at
honestly requires the admission

00:39:33.888 --> 00:39:37.285
that God has done this for no
reason and that the friends'

00:39:37.285 --> 00:39:39.670
understanding of the world is a
lie.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:42.494
Job asserts baldly:
there is no distributive

00:39:42.494 --> 00:39:46.436
justice, there's no coherent or
orderly system of morality in

00:39:46.436 --> 00:39:48.210
this life or any other.
 

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:50.701
There is no principle of
afterlife, after all,

00:39:50.701 --> 00:39:51.920
in the Hebrew Bible.
 

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:57.370
Chapter 21:7-26:
Why do the wicked live on,

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.110
Prosper and grow wealthy?
 

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.300
Their children are with them
always,

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.210
And they see their children's
children.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:04.850
Their homes are secure,
without fear;

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.120
They do not feel the rod of God.
 

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.719
…their children skip about.
 

00:40:08.719 --> 00:40:10.969
They sing to the music of
timbrel and lute,

00:40:10.969 --> 00:40:12.880
And revel to the tune of the
pipe;

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.600
They spend their days in
happiness,

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.000
And go down to Sheol in peace.
 

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.400
…How seldom does the lamp of
the wicked fail,

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.989
Does the calamity they deserve
befall them?

00:40:21.989 --> 00:40:23.829
…[You say,]
"God is reserving his

00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:27.084
punishment for his sons";
Let it be paid back to Him that

00:40:27.084 --> 00:40:29.623
He may feel it,
...One man dies in robust

00:40:29.623 --> 00:40:31.940
health,
All tranquil and untroubled;

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.441
His pails are full of milk;
The marrow of his bones is

00:40:35.441 --> 00:40:37.920
juicy.
Another dies embittered,

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.790
Never having tasted happiness.
 

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:42.695
They both lie in the dust
And are covered with

00:40:42.695 --> 00:40:45.187
worms.
But the friends can't look

00:40:45.187 --> 00:40:47.942
honestly at Job;
they can't allow that,

00:40:47.942 --> 00:40:51.019
indeed, a righteous man suffers
horribly.

00:40:51.019 --> 00:40:55.648
By the end of the third cycle
Job is ready and eager for his

00:40:55.648 --> 00:40:58.079
trial, but he can't find God.
 

00:40:58.079 --> 00:41:02.459
Job's final speech in the third
cycle focuses on this theme of

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:05.518
divine absence.
God is irresponsibly absent

00:41:05.518 --> 00:41:08.989
from the world and the result is
human wickedness.

00:41:08.989 --> 00:41:12.474
So from the idea that God is
morally neutral or indifferent,

00:41:12.474 --> 00:41:15.958
Job has moved to the implicit
charge that God is responsible

00:41:15.958 --> 00:41:18.210
for wickedness.
He rewards wickedness;

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:21.881
he causes wickedness by his
absence, his failure to govern

00:41:21.881 --> 00:41:24.632
properly.
He is both corrupt and a

00:41:24.632 --> 00:41:26.420
corrupter of others.
 

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:29.416
"If it is not so,
he says, who will prove me a

00:41:29.416 --> 00:41:31.880
liar and bring my words to
nought."

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.500
Yet, even in the depths of his
anguish, and even though he is

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.889
now convinced that God does not
enforce a moral law in the

00:41:40.889 --> 00:41:43.568
universe,
Job clings to one value:

00:41:43.568 --> 00:41:46.505
righteousness is a virtue in
and of itself,

00:41:46.505 --> 00:41:50.351
and even if it brings no reward
Job will not give up his

00:41:50.351 --> 00:41:53.601
righteousness.
Face to face with the shocking

00:41:53.601 --> 00:41:57.510
insight that good and evil are
met with indifference by God,

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.569
that righteousness brings no
reward and wickedness no

00:42:00.569 --> 00:42:04.644
punishment, Job although bitter,
refuses to succumb to a moral

00:42:04.644 --> 00:42:08.710
nihilism.
Chapter 27:2-6:

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:11.849
By God who has deprived
me of justice!

00:42:11.849 --> 00:42:14.060
By Shaddai who has embittered
my life!

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.762
As long as there is life in me,
And God's breath is in my

00:42:17.762 --> 00:42:20.300
nostrils,
My lips will speak no wrong,

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.940
Nor my tongue utter deceit.
 

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.420
Far be it for me to say that
you are right;

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.719
Until I die I will maintain my
integrity.

00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:31.269
I persist in my righteousness
and will not yield;

00:42:31.269 --> 00:42:34.570
I shall be free of reproach as
long as I live.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.249
These last lines recall the
words of God and the

00:42:37.249 --> 00:42:38.960
satan in the prelude.
 

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.843
The satan had said that
a man will not hold on to virtue

00:42:41.843 --> 00:42:44.030
or to righteousness in the face
of suffering.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:46.849
He'll give everything away for
his life.

00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:50.785
So this narrative set-up guides
or influences our interpretation

00:42:50.785 --> 00:42:52.409
of Job's statement here.
 

00:42:52.409 --> 00:42:55.769
Although he is losing his life,
Job says he will not give

00:42:55.769 --> 00:42:59.947
anything away but he holds onto,
he maintains his integrity just

00:42:59.947 --> 00:43:03.325
as God had scolded the
satan in chapter 2:3

00:43:03.325 --> 00:43:05.662
which reads,
"Still he holds onto his

00:43:05.662 --> 00:43:08.122
integrity.
You have incited me to destroy

00:43:08.122 --> 00:43:09.239
him for nothing."
 

00:43:09.239 --> 00:43:12.592
So in his darkest,
most bitter hour with all hope

00:43:12.592 --> 00:43:15.735
of reward gone,
Job clings to the one thing he

00:43:15.735 --> 00:43:17.900
has--his own righteousness.
 

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.303
In fact, when all hope of just
reward is gone then

00:43:21.303 --> 00:43:24.289
righteousness becomes an
intrinsic value.

00:43:24.289 --> 00:43:28.409
Yehezkel Kaufman writes of this
moment, "the poet raises Job to

00:43:28.409 --> 00:43:31.598
the bleak summit of
righteousness bereft of hope,

00:43:31.598 --> 00:43:34.190
bereft of faith in divine
justice".

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:37.077
Or in the words of another
scholar, Moshe Greenberg,

00:43:37.077 --> 00:43:39.648
we see here
..the sheer heroism of a

00:43:39.648 --> 00:43:43.265
naked man, forsaken by his God
and his friends and bereft of a

00:43:43.265 --> 00:43:45.400
clue to understand his
suffering,

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.171
still maintaining faith in the
value of his virtue and in the

00:43:49.171 --> 00:43:51.559
absolute duty of man to be
virtuous.

00:43:51.559 --> 00:43:53.960
The universe has turned its
back on him.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.235
We may add he believes God has
turned his back on him--yet Job

00:43:57.235 --> 00:43:59.974
persists in the affirmation of
his own worth and the

00:43:59.974 --> 00:44:03.679
transcendent worth of unrewarded
good [Greenberg 1987,285].

00:44:03.679 --> 00:44:06.912
So in a way then,
for all their differences in

00:44:06.912 --> 00:44:10.216
style and manner,
the patient Job of the legend

00:44:10.216 --> 00:44:13.520
and the raging Job of the poetic
dialogue,

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.690
are basically the same man.
 

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.784
Each ultimately remains firm in
his moral character,

00:44:18.784 --> 00:44:22.122
clinging to righteousness
because of its intrinsic value

00:44:22.122 --> 00:44:24.550
and not because it will be
rewarded.

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:27.960
Indeed, Job knows bitterly that
it will not.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:32.730
At the end of his outburst,
Job sues God.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:37.035
He issues Him a summons and he
demands that God reveal to him

00:44:37.035 --> 00:44:39.260
the reason for his suffering.
 

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.726
Job pronounces a series of
curses to clear himself from the

00:44:42.726 --> 00:44:46.015
accusations against him,
specifying the sins he has not

00:44:46.015 --> 00:44:47.924
committed and ending,
as he began,

00:44:47.924 --> 00:44:50.787
in chapter 3,
with a curse on the day of his

00:44:50.787 --> 00:44:52.936
birth.
We expect to hear from God now

00:44:52.936 --> 00:44:55.651
but instead we hear from an
unannounced stranger,

00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:57.572
Elihu.
I'm going to have to give Elihu

00:44:57.572 --> 00:45:00.230
short shrift.
He's the only one of the four

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:04.409
interlocutors to refer to Job by
name, address Job by name.

00:45:04.409 --> 00:45:08.550
He repeats many of the trite
assertions of Job's friends.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:12.161
He does hint,
however, that not all suffering

00:45:12.161 --> 00:45:14.511
is punitive.
He also hints that

00:45:14.511 --> 00:45:18.251
contemplation of nature's
elements can open the mind to a

00:45:18.251 --> 00:45:21.590
new awareness of God and in
these two respects,

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:26.610
Elihu's speech moves us towards
God's answer from the storm.

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:30.159
So in the climatic moment,
God answers Job in an

00:45:30.159 --> 00:45:33.860
extraordinary theophany,
or self-manifestation.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:37.835
In chapter 38 God speaks out of
the tempest or whirlwind,

00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:40.320
"Who is this who darkens
counsel,

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.884
speaking without knowledge," is
he referring to Job,

00:45:43.884 --> 00:45:46.889
to Elihu, the three friends,
all of them?

00:45:46.889 --> 00:45:49.807
God has heard enough,
it's his turn to ask questions,

00:45:49.807 --> 00:45:52.220
the answers to which are
clearly implied;

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.880
these are rhetorical questions.
 

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.520
Where were you when I
laid the earth's foundations?

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.360
Speak if you have understanding.
 

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.690
Do you know who fixed its
dimensions

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:02.190
Or who measured it with a line?"
 

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:05.482
You did, God.
…Have you ever commanded the

00:46:05.482 --> 00:46:07.909
day to break,
Assigned the dawn its place,

00:46:07.909 --> 00:46:10.519
…Have you penetrated to the
sources of the sea,

00:46:10.519 --> 00:46:12.600
Or walked in the recesses of
the deep?

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.539
No, no human has.
 

00:46:14.539 --> 00:46:16.895
And God continues with these
rhetorical questions,

00:46:16.895 --> 00:46:18.530
questions regarding the
animals,

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:22.479
their various powers and
attributes, but one wonders what

00:46:22.479 --> 00:46:25.300
the purpose of all these
questions is.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:28.400
One senses that they are
irrelevant.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.290
Job has posed some very
specific challenges to God.

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:33.640
Why am I suffering?
 

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.710
Is there a pattern to existence?
 

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:39.145
Is God's refusal to answer
these challenges a way of saying

00:46:39.145 --> 00:46:40.389
there is no answer?
 

00:46:40.389 --> 00:46:43.843
Or is it God's way of saying
that justice is beyond human

00:46:43.843 --> 00:46:46.819
understanding?
Or is this theophany of God in

00:46:46.819 --> 00:46:50.466
nature and the focus on
creation, an implicit assault on

00:46:50.466 --> 00:46:54.113
the fundamental tenant of
Israelite religion that God is

00:46:54.113 --> 00:46:58.489
known and made manifest through
his interactions with humans,

00:46:58.489 --> 00:47:02.360
his rewards and punishments in
historical time.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.257
You'll recall that the
monotheistic revolution is

00:47:05.257 --> 00:47:08.216
generally understood to have
effected a break from

00:47:08.216 --> 00:47:11.899
mythological conceptions of the
gods as indistinguishable from

00:47:11.899 --> 00:47:15.817
various natural forces,
limited by meta-divine powers

00:47:15.817 --> 00:47:17.760
and forces of the cosmos.
 

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.453
The biblical God wasn't another
Ancient Near Eastern or

00:47:20.453 --> 00:47:23.690
Canaanite nature God ultimately,
but a wholly transcendent

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:26.769
power--He was figured this way
in many parts of the

00:47:26.769 --> 00:47:30.465
Bible--known not through the
involuntary and recurring cycles

00:47:30.465 --> 00:47:34.408
of nature but through His freely
willed and non-repeating actions

00:47:34.408 --> 00:47:36.010
in historical time.
 

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:39.779
Such a view of God underwrites
the whole system of divine

00:47:39.779 --> 00:47:41.260
retributive justice.
 

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:44.551
Only an essentially good God
who transcends and is

00:47:44.551 --> 00:47:48.582
unconstrained by mechanistic
natural forces can establish and

00:47:48.582 --> 00:47:51.739
administer a system of
retributive justice,

00:47:51.739 --> 00:47:54.942
dealing out punishment and
reward in response to the

00:47:54.942 --> 00:47:56.699
actions of humans in time.
 

00:47:56.699 --> 00:48:00.802
Is the author of Job suggesting
that history and the events that

00:48:00.802 --> 00:48:04.123
befall the just and the unjust
are not the medium of

00:48:04.123 --> 00:48:07.050
revelation?
Is God a god of nature after

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:10.810
all, encountered in the
repeating cycles of the natural

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:14.153
world and not in the
unpredictable and incoherent

00:48:14.153 --> 00:48:16.869
arena of human history and
action?

00:48:16.869 --> 00:48:20.862
If so, then this is a third
fundamental biblical assumption

00:48:20.862 --> 00:48:23.340
that has been radically
subverted.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:27.664
So we'll turn now to God's
direct speech to Job in 40:8,40,

00:48:27.664 --> 00:48:29.230
verse 8, excuse me.
 

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:31.400
"Would you impugn my justice?
 

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.539
/ Would you condemn Me that you
be right?"

00:48:34.539 --> 00:48:36.874
God, I think,
is now getting at the heart of

00:48:36.874 --> 00:48:40.239
the matter: your friends Job
were wrong, they condemned you.

00:48:40.239 --> 00:48:43.090
They attributed sin to you,
so that they might be right.

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:46.040
But you, too,
have been wrong condemning Me,

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:50.019
attributing wickedness to Me so
that you might be right.

00:48:50.019 --> 00:48:52.864
Job's friends erred because
they assumed that there's a

00:48:52.864 --> 00:48:55.919
system of retributive justice at
work in the world and that

00:48:55.919 --> 00:48:59.290
assumption led them to infer
that all who suffer are sinful,

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:01.130
and that's a blatant falsehood.
 

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:04.170
But Job also errs;
if he assumes that although

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:06.606
there isn't a system of
retributive justice,

00:49:06.606 --> 00:49:08.420
there really ought to be one.
 

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:12.423
It's that assumption that leads
him to infer that suffering is a

00:49:12.423 --> 00:49:16.110
sign of an indifferent or wicked
God, and that is equally a

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:19.110
falsehood.
Job needs to move beyond the

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:22.576
anthropocentrism that
characterizes the rest of

00:49:22.576 --> 00:49:26.420
Scripture and the Genesis 1
account of creation,

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:30.860
according to which humankind is
the goal of the entire process

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.893
of creation.
God's creation,

00:49:32.893 --> 00:49:35.866
the Book of Job seems to
suggest, defies such

00:49:35.866 --> 00:49:38.570
teleological and rational
categories.

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:41.624
In a nutshell,
God refuses to be seen as a

00:49:41.624 --> 00:49:43.039
moral accountant.
 

00:49:43.039 --> 00:49:46.399
The idea of God as a moral
accountant is responsible for

00:49:46.399 --> 00:49:49.330
two major errors:
the interpretation of suffering

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:53.624
as an indicator of sin,
or the ascription of injustice

00:49:53.624 --> 00:49:56.157
to God.
In his final speech,

00:49:56.157 --> 00:50:01.002
Job confesses to a new
firsthand knowledge of God that

00:50:01.002 --> 00:50:04.122
he lacked before,
and as a result of this

00:50:04.122 --> 00:50:06.707
knowledge Job repents,
"Therefore, I recant and

00:50:06.707 --> 00:50:09.913
relent,
/ Being but dust and ashes,"

00:50:09.913 --> 00:50:12.213
42:6.
Here we see the other meaning

00:50:12.213 --> 00:50:14.664
of Job's name,
"one who repents," suddenly

00:50:14.664 --> 00:50:15.860
leap to the fore.
 

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.440
What is he repenting of?
 

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.181
Certainly not of sin;
God has not upheld the

00:50:20.181 --> 00:50:21.570
accusations against Job.
 

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:24.664
Indeed he states explicitly in
a moment that the friends were

00:50:24.664 --> 00:50:26.159
wrong to say he had sinned.
 

00:50:26.159 --> 00:50:28.838
But he has indicated that guilt
and innocence,

00:50:28.838 --> 00:50:32.349
reward and punishment are not
what the game is all about,

00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:35.289
and while Job had long been
disabused of the notion that the

00:50:35.289 --> 00:50:38.179
wicked and the righteous
actually get what they deserve,

00:50:38.179 --> 00:50:41.497
he nevertheless had clung to
the idea that ideally they

00:50:41.497 --> 00:50:43.443
should.
And it's that mistaken

00:50:43.443 --> 00:50:47.306
idea--the idea that led him to
ascribe wickedness to God--that

00:50:47.306 --> 00:50:50.299
Job now recants.
With this new understanding of

00:50:50.299 --> 00:50:53.758
God, Job is liberated from what
he would now see as a false

00:50:53.758 --> 00:50:56.859
expectation raised by the
Deuteronomistic notion of a

00:50:56.859 --> 00:51:00.019
covenant relationship between
God and humankind,

00:51:00.019 --> 00:51:02.880
enforced by a system of divine
justice.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:06.170
At the end of the story Job is
fully restored to his fortunes.

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:09.250
God asserts he did no evil and
the conventional,

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:13.313
impeccably Deuteronomistic view
of the three friends is clearly

00:51:13.313 --> 00:51:14.690
denounced by God.
 

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:16.786
He says of them,
"They have not spoken of Me

00:51:16.786 --> 00:51:18.980
what is right as my servant Job
has," 42:7.

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:21.756
For some, the happy ending
seems anticlimactic,

00:51:21.756 --> 00:51:25.016
a capitulation to the demand
for a happy ending of just

00:51:25.016 --> 00:51:28.820
desserts that runs counter to
the whole thrust of the book,

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:32.019
and yet in a way I think the
ending is superbly fitting.

00:51:32.019 --> 00:51:35.587
It's the last in a series of
reversals that subverts our

00:51:35.587 --> 00:51:38.294
expectations.
Suffering comes inexplicably,

00:51:38.294 --> 00:51:41.599
so does restoration;
blessed be the name of the Lord.

00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:46.633
God doesn't attempt to justify
or explain Job's suffering and

00:51:46.633 --> 00:51:50.744
yet somehow by the end of the
book, our grumbling,

00:51:50.744 --> 00:51:54.099
embittered, raging Job is
satisfied.

00:51:54.099 --> 00:51:57.127
Perhaps he's realized that an
automatic principle of reward

00:51:57.127 --> 00:52:00.207
and punishment would make it
impossible for humans to do the

00:52:00.207 --> 00:52:02.400
good for purely disinterested
motives.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.095
It's precisely when
righteousness is seen to be

00:52:05.095 --> 00:52:08.201
absurd and meaningless that the
choice to be righteous

00:52:08.201 --> 00:52:10.369
paradoxically becomes
meaningful.

00:52:10.369 --> 00:52:13.018
God and Job,
however we are to interpret

00:52:13.018 --> 00:52:15.260
their speeches,
are reconciled.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:18.539
The suffering and injustice
that characterize the world have

00:52:18.539 --> 00:52:20.429
baffled humankind for millennia.
 

00:52:20.429 --> 00:52:23.587
And the Book of Job provides no
answer in the sense of an

00:52:23.587 --> 00:52:26.969
explanation or a justification
of suffering and injustice,

00:52:26.969 --> 00:52:30.520
but what it does offer is a
stern warning to avoid the

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.405
Scylla of blaspheming against
the victims by assuming their

00:52:34.405 --> 00:52:36.695
wickedness,
and the Charybdis of

00:52:36.695 --> 00:52:39.329
blaspheming against God by
assuming his.

00:52:39.329 --> 00:52:42.635
Nor is moral nihilism an
option, as our hero,

00:52:42.635 --> 00:52:45.491
yearning for,
but ultimately renouncing

00:52:45.491 --> 00:52:49.795
divine order and justice,
clings to his integrity and

00:52:49.795 --> 00:52:52.000
chooses virtue for nothing.

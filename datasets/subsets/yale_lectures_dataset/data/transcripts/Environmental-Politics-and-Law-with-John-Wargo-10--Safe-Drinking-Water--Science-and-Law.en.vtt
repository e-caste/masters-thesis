00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.741
Prof: Today I want to
talk about water and the law

00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:08.409
that surrounds drinking water,
to talk about its quality,

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:12.100
talk about what your rights are
to clean water.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.837
To also give you a sense of
what key threats are to drinking

00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:19.909
water,
what your exposure might be,

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:24.105
and what we might do about it
both legally but also

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:25.280
personally.
 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.333
Water is a critical component
of our environment and our

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.160
bodies.
 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.430
Your body is close to seventy
percent water.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.207
You can go for several weeks,
two to three on average,

00:00:38.207 --> 00:00:39.560
without food.
 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.570
You can only go for about four
minutes without air.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.342
And you can go for maybe four
or five days without water

00:00:45.342 --> 00:00:46.200
before you die.
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.320
So water is absolutely critical.
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.830
And one of the key arguments I
want to make today is that it's

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.650
a largely neglected area of
environmental law,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.880
given the rapid increase in our
knowledge about chemical threats

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.439
to water quality and where those
threats come from.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.983
So what are the major
challenges in water on a global

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:07.530
scale?
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.900
Clearly one is water-borne
diseases.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.712
Diarrheal diseases are
recognized to kill between four

00:01:15.712 --> 00:01:19.799
and five million people per year
in Africa.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.522
Aquifers that cross property
and jurisdictional boundaries

00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:26.430
are a critical issue.
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.406
So many rivers form the
boundary between nations or

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:31.760
between states.
 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.840
The Connecticut River is a very
good example,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.550
separating Vermont from New
Hampshire.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.040
Point source control versus
surface runoff.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.141
We've had a long history in the
last half of the twentieth

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:52.315
century of trying to control
point sources or pipe releases

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:55.933
to water supplies,
as opposed to thinking about

00:01:55.933 --> 00:02:00.209
how chemicals may accumulate on
the surface and then be washed

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.486
into rivers that are used for
drinking water sources following

00:02:04.486 --> 00:02:06.239
serious rain events.
 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.526
Ground water depletion,
the Ogallala Aquifer in the

00:02:09.526 --> 00:02:13.538
Southwestern part of the United
States and in the western part

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:16.050
of Texas,
is being rapidly depleted.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.220
And its contamination is well
recognized.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.592
Aquifers around the nation and
most industrialized countries

00:02:23.592 --> 00:02:28.038
are now more intensively tested
than they had been before.

00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:31.617
And it's recognized that they
contain chemicals that never

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:34.379
were anticipated to persist or
to migrate.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.310
Private wells.
 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.911
The Safe Drinking Water Act has
been established in the United

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:45.210
States to require testing and
control the chemical content

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.982
only in water systems that
supply more than fifteen

00:02:48.982 --> 00:02:52.300
households,
fifteen or more households.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.666
So if you grew up perhaps in a
rural part of the nation or you

00:02:56.666 --> 00:03:00.460
live outside of New Haven,
you may have your own well,

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.319
as I do.
 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.848
So I have a 600-foot-deep well.
 

00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:08.550
And when I purchased my house,
I was quite happy with that

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.873
prospect,
thinking that water on the

00:03:10.873 --> 00:03:14.080
surface would need to be
filtered down through the soil

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.218
before it got down into the
well.

00:03:16.218 --> 00:03:20.622
And it was quite striking,
I had quite a lesson from a

00:03:20.622 --> 00:03:21.870
well driller.
 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.720
My well went dry one day,
I didn't know what happened.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.961
So I called the well driller
and he came out and it was a

00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:29.930
pretty remarkable lesson for me.
 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.848
Within forty-five minutes,
he had pulled up the well head,

00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:38.430
he had coiled the water,
coiled the pipe,

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.194
and I recognized that I hadn't
paid any attention to the fact

00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:46.086
that the casing that surrounds
the well could convey water that

00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:49.601
had been contaminated on the
surface down the side of the

00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:52.740
casing and into the underlying
water supply.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.315
I'll tell you more about the
plastics side of that story in a

00:03:56.315 --> 00:03:57.030
few weeks.
 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.645
So wells that service greater
than fifteen households are

00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:03.680
regulated under the Safe
Drinking Water Act,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.908
which means that if a chemical
is listed on the EPA's list,

00:04:07.908 --> 00:04:11.518
then community supplies have to
test for the presence of that

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:12.180
chemical.
 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.560
And if a maximum contaminant
level has been set,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.516
that means that the provider
has to demonstrate that that

00:04:19.516 --> 00:04:23.653
ceiling has not been breached,
or he or she would have to

00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:26.430
install some sort of filtration
system.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.723
So within Connecticut,
by the way, that means that

00:04:29.723 --> 00:04:33.420
approximately thirty to forty
percent of the Connecticut

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.723
population is getting water that
is not managed in any way by the

00:04:37.723 --> 00:04:39.740
Safe Drinking Water Act.
 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.504
Surface water in the United
States is generally believed now

00:04:43.504 --> 00:04:46.440
to be undrinkable for a variety
of reasons,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.620
mostly because of biological
contamination,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.704
the threat of E.
 

00:04:49.704 --> 00:04:53.365
coli, but also giardia,
which is carried by both humans

00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:55.670
and by animals in their wastes.
 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.990
Monitoring and surveillance
needs much improvement.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.665
I'll talk more about the
monitoring system that is

00:05:01.665 --> 00:05:04.069
currently in place and why it's
deficient.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.170
Public water infrastructure
also is inadequate.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.586
How many of you know the way
that water moves from its source

00:05:12.586 --> 00:05:13.850
to your tap?
 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.589
What kind of equipment does it
go through?

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:19.430
What kind of filtration does it
go through?

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.232
What kind of land uses are
allowed in the watershed that

00:05:23.232 --> 00:05:27.379
surrounds the lakes that provide
New Haven's water supply?

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.538
And what about the pipes that
convey the water to wherever

00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:32.560
your tap is?
 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.579
Do you know what they're made
out of?

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:35.769
Are they plastic?
 

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:37.430
Are they copper?
 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.350
Are they bronze?
 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.100
Are they metal?
 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.180
Are they leaded?
 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.286
There are many connectors in
many cities that are quite old

00:05:45.286 --> 00:05:48.714
that are no longer allowed to be
installed that connect the water

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:51.660
main itself into your apartment
or into your house.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.485
But they exist and remain
because it's extremely expensive

00:05:55.485 --> 00:05:59.379
to dig up every connector and
replace it with one that does

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:00.790
not contain lead.
 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.750
How about your faucet itself?
 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.730
What's your faucet made out of?
 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.980
Well, many faucets are made out
of brass.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.497
And increasingly,
they're made out of plastic,

00:06:09.497 --> 00:06:12.127
plastic that is painted to look
like it's metal,

00:06:12.127 --> 00:06:13.189
painted silver.
 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:17.697
You have to be really careful
when you buy a faucet system or

00:06:17.697 --> 00:06:21.903
you put in a drinking water
supply system to really think

00:06:21.903 --> 00:06:26.562
deeply about the source of the
materials and their leachability

00:06:26.562 --> 00:06:28.290
into your supply.
 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.850
The leachability is driven by a
variety of factors.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.560
It could be heat.
 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.574
So for example,
you certainly would not want to

00:06:35.574 --> 00:06:39.375
make a cup of tea by turning
your hot water tap on and then

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:41.670
putting a tea bag in the water.
 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.012
Or you want to feed infant
formula to a small child by

00:06:44.012 --> 00:06:45.725
putting powder,
for example,

00:06:45.725 --> 00:06:50.000
in a glass, and then filling it
up with hot tap water,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.858
because the hot tap water is
likely to leach more compounds

00:06:53.858 --> 00:06:57.785
from the pipe or whatever the
conveyance system is than cold

00:06:57.785 --> 00:06:58.850
water would.
 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.648
How long do you wait to let the
water run before you take a

00:07:02.648 --> 00:07:04.220
drink out of your tap?
 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.528
Makes sense not to drink water
that has been sitting in your

00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:10.668
tap overnight or you come back
from vacation for a couple

00:07:10.668 --> 00:07:11.230
weeks.
 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.437
We now recognize that water
that sits in pipes takes up

00:07:15.437 --> 00:07:18.709
contaminates from the conveyance
system.

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:22.074
So all of these issues are
worth thinking about in terms of

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:23.060
infrastructure.
 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.699
How about water rights?
 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:26.759
Really, what are your rights to
clean water?

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:32.213
And the core question of this
lecture is really how safe is

00:07:32.213 --> 00:07:33.529
safe enough?
 

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:36.557
And how do we define safe,
particularly using the language

00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:38.310
of the Safe Drinking Water Act?
 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.810
And finally,
how does land use affect water

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.560
supply?
 

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.202
So many people are not at all
thoughtful about where watershed

00:07:46.202 --> 00:07:49.069
boundaries in the vicinity of
where they live.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.728
They're not thoughtful about
how chemicals can migrate long

00:07:51.728 --> 00:07:52.279
distances.
 

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:56.047
I worked in California in the
Central Valley near Fresno for a

00:07:56.047 --> 00:07:59.257
while on a project where
chemicals were recognized to

00:07:59.257 --> 00:08:02.901
migrate more than five miles
from their point of application

00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:06.360
to an agricultural field into
underlying aquifers.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.434
So it depends very much on the
underlying surficial geology,

00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:12.574
the soil structure,
the bedrock,

00:08:12.574 --> 00:08:16.579
the groundwater regime,
how fast a chemical will move.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:20.286
Some move really quite quickly,
others move really quite slowly

00:08:20.286 --> 00:08:22.500
if they can bind to organic
matter.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.911
So once again,
the Safe Drinking Water Act

00:08:24.911 --> 00:08:28.324
covers supplies that have more
than fourteen connections or

00:08:28.324 --> 00:08:30.560
more than twenty-four
individuals.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.118
There are 53,000 water systems
in the United States,

00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:37.955
and 43,000 of those rely on
groundwater and about 10,000

00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:39.769
rely on surface water.
 

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:43.850
And they're roughly split
fifty-fifty, public and private.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.807
And there are 15 million wells
in the United States that serve

00:08:46.807 --> 00:08:49.688
individual residences,
and roughly 45 million people,

00:08:49.688 --> 00:08:52.806
maybe fifteen percent of the
population in the nation are

00:08:52.806 --> 00:08:55.644
drinking water that is
completely unregulated by the

00:08:55.644 --> 00:08:57.259
Safe Drinking Water Act.
 

00:08:57.259 --> 00:09:00.951
I wondered about this and I
wondered about what we could

00:09:00.951 --> 00:09:03.769
find out about well water
vulnerability.

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:07.058
And also if a casing surround a
well is cracked,

00:09:07.058 --> 00:09:10.246
that means that chemicals
applied to the surface have a

00:09:10.246 --> 00:09:13.730
higher chance of migrating down
the inside of the casing.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.538
So I asked the Department of
Environmental Protection and the

00:09:16.538 --> 00:09:19.158
Department of Health here in
Connecticut if I could get a

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:22.222
hold of their database--
GIS, Geographic Information

00:09:22.222 --> 00:09:25.796
System that they had that
identified the location of all

00:09:25.796 --> 00:09:31.245
wells in Connecticut,
all wells that had been mapped

00:09:31.245 --> 00:09:33.158
and geo-coded.
 

00:09:33.158 --> 00:09:37.110
And then I overlaid that data
with surficial geology.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.520
And then I started looking at
old air photos,

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.440
wondering about former land
uses.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.376
And a pattern started to emerge
that in many areas that had been

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:49.647
former agricultural lands,
these had been developed into

00:09:49.647 --> 00:09:54.732
residential areas and wells had
been dug into those areas and

00:09:54.732 --> 00:09:59.308
provided unregulated water
supplies to almost a million

00:09:59.308 --> 00:10:02.700
people in the state of
Connecticut.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.139
It's kind of an interesting
story.

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:07.798
When I asked for that database,
I was denied access to it.

00:10:07.798 --> 00:10:11.717
This was post-9/11,
because they were worried about

00:10:11.717 --> 00:10:16.889
releasing the geo-coded data on
precisely where the wells where.

00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:20.654
So I had to sign a paper that
promised that I would be legally

00:10:20.654 --> 00:10:23.926
responsible for securing that
data and maintaining its

00:10:23.926 --> 00:10:27.753
confidentiality and I would not
release it to anybody who could

00:10:27.753 --> 00:10:30.840
do something nasty to a public
water supply.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.330
So what about compliance?
 

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.759
How are we doing in the area of
compliance?

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:48.418
Well, 30 million people drink
water each year.

00:10:48.418 --> 00:10:49.639
A little hiccup there for some
reason.

00:10:49.639 --> 00:10:51.294
Thirty million people drink
water each year from systems

00:10:51.294 --> 00:10:52.830
that report violations of
health-based standards.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.966
There are about ninety-three
chemicals that are not now on

00:10:55.966 --> 00:10:59.158
the Safe Drinking Water list,
that have maximum contaminant

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:00.700
levels assigned to them.
 

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.014
So 30 million people,
ten percent of the population,

00:11:04.014 --> 00:11:08.240
drinking water that the systems
have reported are in violation.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.125
Ten thousand systems violated
health-based drinking water

00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:13.857
standards and about eighty
percent of the public water

00:11:13.857 --> 00:11:15.918
systems have reported no
violations.

00:11:15.918 --> 00:11:19.381
And EPA has issued 86,000
violations of federal

00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:22.918
requirements to monitor or to
report results.

00:11:22.918 --> 00:11:26.476
So the overwhelming number of
violations are associated with

00:11:26.476 --> 00:11:29.548
the failure to monitor and the
failure to report.

00:11:29.548 --> 00:11:32.003
So if you don't look,
if you don't monitor,

00:11:32.003 --> 00:11:33.580
you can't find a problem.
 

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.956
And if you find a problem and
you're a municipal supplier,

00:11:36.956 --> 00:11:39.210
that's going to cost a lot of
money.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.831
You're either going to try to
pass that cost back on to

00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:48.879
consumers as increased prices
per gallon for their water.

00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:56.067
But certainly,
you're not going to want

00:11:56.067 --> 00:12:04.389
to--there's commonly a delay in
reporting.

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:12.658
So what is an MCLG?
 

00:12:12.658 --> 00:12:14.450
A maximum contaminate level
goal?

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.124
EPA established both the
maximum contaminant level,

00:12:17.124 --> 00:12:19.210
which is a legally enforceable
limit.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.102
But they also established a
maximum contaminant level goal,

00:12:22.102 --> 00:12:23.798
which is a health-based
ceiling.

00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:27.698
So you would hope that the
legal limit would be the same as

00:12:27.698 --> 00:12:29.379
the health-based limit.
 

00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:31.440
But that's really not the case.
 

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.980
So the Safe Drinking Water Act
creates the contaminate level

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.674
limit as the highest
concentration of a contaminant

00:12:41.674 --> 00:12:43.460
that's allowed.
 

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.349
And it also allows a
cost-benefit analysis that's

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:50.081
required under the Safe Drinking
Water Act to consider what the

00:12:50.081 --> 00:12:52.490
cost would be of meeting that
limit.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.590
If the cost is found to be
excessively high,

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.822
they'll set a goal that would
be higher to protect human

00:12:58.822 --> 00:13:01.240
health,
and allow a contamination level

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.658
to be higher than that.
 

00:13:02.658 --> 00:13:06.586
So here's a chart that gets us
to really what our present level

00:13:06.586 --> 00:13:07.788
of regulation is.
 

00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:12.659
And you see that after the Safe
Drinking Water Act was passed

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:16.720
back in 1976 that no new
standards were enacted.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.450
It's been kind of interesting.
 

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.081
So Congress basically gives EPA
the mandate to regulate and

00:13:22.081 --> 00:13:25.402
monitor water supplies,
but EPA doesn't really do very

00:13:25.402 --> 00:13:26.528
much about it.
 

00:13:26.528 --> 00:13:31.244
This period in the 1970s and
early 1980s was a period that

00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:36.206
EPA was concentrating on source
emissions from smokestacks as

00:13:36.206 --> 00:13:41.168
well as auto emissions and also
a variety of pesticides.

00:13:41.168 --> 00:13:44.833
But really, it was paying very
little attention to drinking

00:13:44.833 --> 00:13:45.340
water.
 

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.703
So it added seven volatile
organic compounds in 1987,

00:13:49.703 --> 00:13:51.970
about eleven years later.
 

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:57.123
Copper and lead were not
revised based upon new evidence

00:13:57.123 --> 00:14:02.932
of their toxicity from data that
had been collected back in the

00:14:02.932 --> 00:14:04.899
1970s until 1991.
 

00:14:04.899 --> 00:14:07.589
So remember,
I argued earlier that there's

00:14:07.589 --> 00:14:11.131
often this delay between
recognizing that a compound is

00:14:11.131 --> 00:14:14.937
more hazardous than earlier
thought before the agency would

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:17.428
take action and set a new limit.
 

00:14:17.428 --> 00:14:19.889
We're seeing the same thing
play out here.

00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:24.111
Well, Congress was upset at
this delay and they demanded

00:14:24.111 --> 00:14:27.490
that a variety of new chemicals
be added,

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:31.773
including thirty-nine
pesticides, volatile organic

00:14:31.773 --> 00:14:33.879
compounds,
metals.

00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:35.668
So these were added in 1991.
 

00:14:35.668 --> 00:14:38.985
And then during the period of
the 1990s, seven years,

00:14:38.985 --> 00:14:40.899
there were no new standards.
 

00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:44.918
Well that's kind of
interesting, because you might

00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:49.509
assume quickly that in a more
liberal administration that

00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:53.200
you'd have more rapid listing
chemicals,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.850
you'd have a more protective
character.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.808
This is not the case.
 

00:14:56.808 --> 00:15:00.374
So that the liberalism or the
conservatism of the

00:15:00.374 --> 00:15:04.903
administration seemed to have
little influence on this rate of

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:05.870
adoption.
 

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.313
So today we're sitting here
with about ninety-three

00:15:08.313 --> 00:15:09.389
different chemicals.
 

00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:14.240
And just to give you a sense of
how limited coverage and limited

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.629
the protection level is,
think about this.

00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:21.936
That among the thirty-nine
pesticides that are monitored

00:15:21.936 --> 00:15:25.460
and have these maximum
contaminant limits,

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.854
there are approximately 1,000
more that are completely

00:15:29.854 --> 00:15:30.850
neglected.
 

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.831
Nobody's testing for them,
but they're allowed to be used

00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:35.110
on agricultural crops.
 

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.094
And many of these have not been
fully studied to know how they

00:15:39.094 --> 00:15:43.208
move through different kinds of
ecosystems or different kinds of

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:47.258
geologic systems and what their
potential is to contaminate the

00:15:47.258 --> 00:15:48.500
water supply.
 

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.376
Think also that more than 800
other chemicals,

00:15:51.376 --> 00:15:55.085
including industrial chemicals,
have been detected in water

00:15:55.085 --> 00:15:56.620
supplies by the U.S.
 

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.490
Geological Service.
 

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.418
And by the way, the U.S.
 

00:15:59.418 --> 00:16:02.605
Geological Service is playing a
really unusual role in this

00:16:02.605 --> 00:16:06.065
regulatory process in that they
sit within the Department of the

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:06.778
Interior.
 

00:16:06.778 --> 00:16:08.758
They're completely unrelated to
the Environmental Protection

00:16:08.758 --> 00:16:09.058
Agency.
 

00:16:09.058 --> 00:16:13.505
But they're playing a more
vigilant role in monitoring

00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:18.120
chemical content and hazards in
underlying aquifers,

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.480
as well as surface waters,
than the Environmental

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.990
Protection Agency had during
this period of time.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.255
So this is a history of
neglect, of limited

00:16:26.255 --> 00:16:29.443
surveillance,
and it's being driven by one

00:16:29.443 --> 00:16:33.100
fundamental characteristic of
this statute.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.522
This is a listing statute,
which means that every time a

00:16:37.522 --> 00:16:42.426
new chemical is discovered and
EPA decides they hope to either

00:16:42.426 --> 00:16:46.523
set a goal or to set a limit,
they're going to get a fight

00:16:46.523 --> 00:16:49.640
from all the municipal suppliers
or the private suppliers because

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.320
the testing costs are going to
be passed on to them.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.029
And these testing costs are
often not minor.

00:16:56.029 --> 00:16:59.629
By the way, it's interesting to
think about what the effect

00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:02.610
might be of establishing a new
chemical limit.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:08.529
Well, it may mean that you need
to conduct a brand new type of

00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:09.210
test.
 

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.079
It may also mean that you need
to install filtration equipment,

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:15.826
perhaps activated carbon
filtration, which is

00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:17.700
extraordinarily expensive.
 

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:22.371
And the smaller the water
system is, the more expense it's

00:17:22.371 --> 00:17:26.058
going to allocate per individual
household.

00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:28.666
So if New York City,
for example,

00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:32.660
is facing a new standard that
EPA has adopted,

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.826
they can pass the cost of
monitoring and filtration on to

00:17:35.826 --> 00:17:37.578
a very broad group of people.
 

00:17:37.578 --> 00:17:39.890
But if you have a much smaller
community,

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.674
say in the rural west of a
couple hundred people in an

00:17:44.674 --> 00:17:47.580
isolated area,
that's going to be much more

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.048
difficult for them to comply.
 

00:17:49.048 --> 00:17:54.862
So there's been a trend towards
source protection instead of

00:17:54.862 --> 00:17:57.029
consumer protection.
 

00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:59.684
And in part,
you can see this happening,

00:17:59.684 --> 00:18:02.477
what the public response to
this has been,

00:18:02.477 --> 00:18:05.950
which is to rely increasingly
on bottled water.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.935
And many people have the
perception that bottled water is

00:18:08.935 --> 00:18:10.588
much safer than tap water is.
 

00:18:10.588 --> 00:18:14.130
Well, it's not at all clear
that that is the case.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.467
Many people do not understand
the filtration techniques of

00:18:17.467 --> 00:18:18.990
bottled water companies.
 

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.180
We don't really have clear
standards.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:27.646
And also, many of the companies
that are marketing heavily in

00:18:27.646 --> 00:18:31.838
the United States are now
foreign companies.

00:18:31.838 --> 00:18:37.691
So the public's perception of
safety is really poorly founded

00:18:37.691 --> 00:18:40.130
in scientific evidence.
 

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.348
Also, there's a story about
plastic.

00:18:42.348 --> 00:18:45.928
What about the potential of
plastic ingredients to migrate

00:18:45.928 --> 00:18:47.309
into water supplies?
 

00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:49.088
I'll give you one example.
 

00:18:49.088 --> 00:18:55.128
About fifteen years ago,
I had bottled water in my house

00:18:55.128 --> 00:19:00.618
as we were putting in a new
water supply system.

00:19:00.618 --> 00:19:06.221
And so the bottled water came
in a jug that was polycarbonate,

00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:08.058
a five-gallon jug.
 

00:19:08.058 --> 00:19:10.693
You probably have all seen
these, that you'd flip upside

00:19:10.693 --> 00:19:11.028
down.
 

00:19:11.028 --> 00:19:16.028
And I had left that bottle
outdoors, actually had been away

00:19:16.028 --> 00:19:19.819
for the weekend,
it was delivered on a Friday

00:19:19.819 --> 00:19:22.318
during the summer months.
 

00:19:22.318 --> 00:19:25.828
And the temperature had gone up
to about 102.

00:19:25.828 --> 00:19:28.790
And it was sitting on my
driveway in the sun when the

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.500
ambient temperature was 102.
 

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.588
So it was really baking.
 

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:35.470
So when I opened the bottle and
put it on the stand,

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.351
I found that it had a really
very acrid taste to it,

00:19:39.351 --> 00:19:41.328
a bitter, acrid taste.
 

00:19:41.328 --> 00:19:45.324
So I called the water company
and I asked the bottling company

00:19:45.324 --> 00:19:46.700
what might that be?
 

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.766
And the response was,
"Oh, we'll have a new

00:19:49.766 --> 00:19:51.920
shipment out to you right away.
 

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.961
It was probably just the
cleaning agent or the

00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:56.640
disinfecting agent that we put
the bottles through."

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.740
Well, I studied the problem
more intensely and found that

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:05.134
they were using a disinfectant
that was actually a registered

00:20:05.134 --> 00:20:06.160
pesticide.
 

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.039
And also this was perfectly
allowable because it makes sense

00:20:10.039 --> 00:20:13.526
to try to disinfect water
bottles that are coming back

00:20:13.526 --> 00:20:16.750
that may have had stagnant water
within them.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:20.789
But somehow,
the rinsing process hadn't

00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:25.150
effectively removed the cleaning
agent.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:30.073
Well, the bottled water problem
goes on in that I looked more

00:20:30.073 --> 00:20:34.750
carefully at the potential of
plastics to migrate from the

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.130
polycarbonate into water.
 

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:42.565
And heat, solvents such as some
biocides are mixed with,

00:20:42.565 --> 00:20:47.507
also cracks in the bottles
themselves can cause the

00:20:47.507 --> 00:20:51.558
chemicals to migrate more
frequently.

00:20:51.558 --> 00:20:55.070
The offending chemical in this
case is bisphenol A,

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.808
and we'll talk more about that
later.

00:20:57.808 --> 00:21:02.048
If you look across the maximum
contaminant limits and you

00:21:02.048 --> 00:21:05.230
compare them to the public
health goal,

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.175
this study by the state of
California found that the

00:21:09.175 --> 00:21:13.284
maximum contaminant limit,
the allowable concentration,

00:21:13.284 --> 00:21:18.092
was often two,
four, even sixteen times higher

00:21:18.092 --> 00:21:22.710
than the health goal,
which tells us that in many

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:26.528
cases the agency is making a
determination that we can be

00:21:26.528 --> 00:21:29.868
exposed at a limit that they
believe is not health

00:21:29.868 --> 00:21:30.960
protective.
 

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.680
There are other studies that
have demonstrated a similar

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.130
finding for other chemicals
besides the elements.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.700
So one of the ways to think
about the effectiveness of any

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.269
statute is to think carefully
about how it's monitored.

00:21:45.269 --> 00:21:49.726
So what sampling design should
be created in order to figure

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:53.425
out whether or not we're
effectively searching for

00:21:53.425 --> 00:21:56.750
chemicals that pose the greatest
threat?

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:01.355
Well, I asked this question of
the New Haven Water Authority

00:22:01.355 --> 00:22:05.726
and found to my surprise that
systems of twenty-five to a

00:22:05.726 --> 00:22:09.941
thousand people are only
required to provide one sample

00:22:09.941 --> 00:22:11.190
per month.
 

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:15.497
And it's pretty clear that
there are certain climatological

00:22:15.497 --> 00:22:18.500
events,
like very serious rain storms,

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.890
that can wash contaminants off
of surfaces,

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:25.886
whether it's an agricultural
field or say a large shopping

00:22:25.886 --> 00:22:29.519
center parking lot,
into surrounding water supplies

00:22:29.519 --> 00:22:30.868
if they are nearby.
 

00:22:30.868 --> 00:22:35.306
So thinking about the
importance of the sampling

00:22:35.306 --> 00:22:37.950
period is really critical.
 

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.901
And if recent reports have
demonstrated compliance with

00:22:41.901 --> 00:22:45.413
certain standards,
then EPA allows the testing to

00:22:45.413 --> 00:22:48.558
be limited to only four times
per year.

00:22:48.558 --> 00:22:52.054
And for some types of systems,
such as New Haven Water

00:22:52.054 --> 00:22:54.317
Company,
they have not found certain

00:22:54.317 --> 00:22:57.502
pesticides,
so they're allowed to monitor

00:22:57.502 --> 00:22:59.608
only on an annual basis.
 

00:22:59.608 --> 00:23:02.135
They can appeal to the
Environmental Protection Agency

00:23:02.135 --> 00:23:04.328
to reduce the periodicity of
their sampling.

00:23:04.328 --> 00:23:06.249
And this of course is very
important to them,

00:23:06.249 --> 00:23:07.950
because it saves them a lot of
money.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:13.105
Trizine herbicides provide a
really good example of this in

00:23:13.105 --> 00:23:14.348
the Midwest.
 

00:23:14.348 --> 00:23:17.784
So trizine herbicides,
they're known as pre-emergent

00:23:17.784 --> 00:23:18.660
herbicides.
 

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.838
And they're commonly sprayed on
fields such as cornfields.

00:23:21.838 --> 00:23:24.430
And they're sprayed during the
spring.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.306
And the spring in the
midwestern part of the United

00:23:27.306 --> 00:23:30.930
States is kind of famous for the
intensity of its rainstorms.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:35.609
So the sampling design relative
to the rain events really proved

00:23:35.609 --> 00:23:38.880
to be extremely important to the
findings.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.558
You can pay more attention to
the slide online,

00:23:43.558 --> 00:23:47.107
but these data demonstrate the
ways that increasing the

00:23:47.107 --> 00:23:50.655
stringency of standards passes
costs on to water supply

00:23:50.655 --> 00:23:54.796
companies and to people that are
served in really an inequitable

00:23:54.796 --> 00:23:59.328
way that is dependent upon the
size of the public water system.

00:23:59.328 --> 00:24:04.642
So I want to concentrate today
and tell you a story about this

00:24:04.642 --> 00:24:05.598
chemical.
 

00:24:05.598 --> 00:24:09.314
This is a trizine herbicide and
now it's about

00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:11.788
twenty-seven-year-old story.
 

00:24:11.788 --> 00:24:15.200
But atrazine has become
infamous as one of the most

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.858
heavily used herbicides in the
world.

00:24:17.858 --> 00:24:21.941
Its uses in the United States
include food crops:

00:24:21.941 --> 00:24:25.597
field corn, sweet corn,
sugar cane, sorghum,

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:29.000
winter wheat,
guava, macadamia nuts.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.944
It's used also on nonfood
crops, such as hay,

00:24:31.944 --> 00:24:32.950
pasturelands.
 

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.048
It's also used in forestry.
 

00:24:35.048 --> 00:24:38.720
It's also used in residential
and industrial and recreational

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.210
areas.
 

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.525
On residential turf,
within parks and on

00:24:42.525 --> 00:24:44.309
institutional turf.
 

00:24:44.309 --> 00:24:45.930
Also on golf courses.
 

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.900
And it's used for landscape
maintenance.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.143
And the whole idea behind an
herbicide is to kill other

00:24:51.143 --> 00:24:54.686
species of plants so that they
don't rob nutrients away from

00:24:54.686 --> 00:24:57.029
the desired or highly valued
plant.

00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:59.410
So it's also sprayed on
roadways.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.328
And this is an interesting idea.
 

00:25:01.328 --> 00:25:03.170
It would be a great student
project.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:07.104
Think about the number of miles
of roadways in the United States

00:25:07.104 --> 00:25:09.288
that are treated with
herbicides.

00:25:09.288 --> 00:25:12.818
My town is a good example,
little town of Killingworth.

00:25:12.818 --> 00:25:15.345
They don't like to cut the
vegetation next to the

00:25:15.345 --> 00:25:16.029
guardrails.
 

00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:17.650
So what do they do instead?
 

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.135
They come along with a truck
and they just spray the side of

00:25:20.135 --> 00:25:20.598
the road.
 

00:25:20.598 --> 00:25:23.941
Next time you get on Amtrak,
take a look at the vegetation

00:25:23.941 --> 00:25:27.400
that goes along the track,
and you'll see almost nothing.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.849
You'll see it devoid of
vegetation.

00:25:28.849 --> 00:25:30.019
How do they do that?
 

00:25:30.019 --> 00:25:31.809
Is it just that they didn't
plant anything?

00:25:31.809 --> 00:25:32.750
No.
 

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.009
Because seeds would blow into
the area and they would grow

00:25:35.009 --> 00:25:36.279
unless chemicals were applied.
 

00:25:36.279 --> 00:25:39.288
So along major highways in the
United States,

00:25:39.288 --> 00:25:43.615
along state highways in many
communities in areas that have

00:25:43.615 --> 00:25:48.269
guardrails,
along corridors that are used

00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:55.490
for power lines or rail on the
runways of many airports,

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.890
pesticides are applied.
 

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.810
So if you count up the total
area in the nation where these

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.856
herbicides are applied,
you can quickly get up to

00:26:04.856 --> 00:26:07.329
hundreds of millions of acres of
the landscape.

00:26:07.329 --> 00:26:08.680
It's really quite striking.
 

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.215
So, you know,
finding a chemical such as this

00:26:11.215 --> 00:26:14.329
in the water supply really
should not be that much of a

00:26:14.329 --> 00:26:15.078
surprise.
 

00:26:15.078 --> 00:26:18.202
But no one has really looked
systematically at where

00:26:18.202 --> 00:26:21.019
concentrations of applications
are going on.

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:24.758
But I'll give you one example
of where you might conduct this

00:26:24.758 --> 00:26:25.880
kind of a study.
 

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.269
And that's with golf courses.
 

00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:32.493
So that about $225 million per
year in the United States are

00:26:32.493 --> 00:26:35.858
spent on chemical treatments of
golf courses.

00:26:35.858 --> 00:26:38.788
There is almost no landscape
that I could imagine,

00:26:38.788 --> 00:26:43.227
including agricultural lands,
that are treated more intensely

00:26:43.227 --> 00:26:46.008
than golf courses,
and particularly putting

00:26:46.008 --> 00:26:46.519
surfaces.
 

00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:52.515
So about $1,300 per acre of
35,000 acres of putting surfaces

00:26:52.515 --> 00:26:59.019
are receiving quite a variety of
different biocidal compounds.

00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:02.618
As a nation,
we need to think about where

00:27:02.618 --> 00:27:05.950
are we applying chemicals the
most.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.286
And we're doing it
predominantly to field crops:

00:27:09.286 --> 00:27:12.771
field corn--
about 59 million acres of field

00:27:12.771 --> 00:27:16.155
corn is treated,
sorghum, sugar cane,

00:27:16.155 --> 00:27:20.608
sweet corn--in both processed
and fresh form.

00:27:20.608 --> 00:27:25.240
So large percentages of these
crops are treated with atrazine.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.394
So if you map out the
concentration of atrazine in

00:27:29.394 --> 00:27:32.866
streams in the United States,
you see it centered on the

00:27:32.866 --> 00:27:35.063
Midwestern part of the country,
and this is the primary

00:27:35.063 --> 00:27:36.190
corn-growing region.
 

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:40.252
So what you find is
concentrations in the microgram

00:27:40.252 --> 00:27:43.747
per liter level,
which is a part per billion

00:27:43.747 --> 00:27:44.558
level.
 

00:27:44.558 --> 00:27:50.087
And the maximum concentration
level, the MCL for atrazine is,

00:27:50.087 --> 00:27:53.589
I believe it's three or point
three.

00:27:53.589 --> 00:27:58.618
Excuse me, parts per billion.
 

00:27:58.618 --> 00:28:01.962
And if you look across the
nation to the number of people

00:28:01.962 --> 00:28:05.126
now that the Environmental
Protection Agency think are

00:28:05.126 --> 00:28:08.710
drinking residues of this
chemical in the water supply,

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.150
you see this adds up to
millions of people.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.845
So large circles,
like the one around Texas,

00:28:13.845 --> 00:28:16.288
represent more than 8 million
people.

00:28:16.288 --> 00:28:20.553
Circles around Florida
represent about 4 million

00:28:20.553 --> 00:28:21.368
people.
 

00:28:21.368 --> 00:28:24.655
So you see that they're finding
it in the water where it's most

00:28:24.655 --> 00:28:26.828
heavily used for agricultural
purposes.

00:28:26.828 --> 00:28:31.298
So this was first registered in
1958.

00:28:31.298 --> 00:28:33.733
And by registered I mean it was
given a license,

00:28:33.733 --> 00:28:35.338
it's like a driver's license.
 

00:28:35.338 --> 00:28:37.694
So atrazine,
it's regulated under the Safe

00:28:37.694 --> 00:28:40.586
Drinking Water Act,
it's regulated under the Clean

00:28:40.586 --> 00:28:43.884
Water Act as well,
and EPA began a Special Review

00:28:43.884 --> 00:28:48.314
that reserve for chemicals that
they have particular concerns

00:28:48.314 --> 00:28:49.568
about in 1994.
 

00:28:49.568 --> 00:28:55.143
Now Special Review has had a
rather infamous history inside

00:28:55.143 --> 00:28:55.720
EPA.
 

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.896
And I have a good friend who
graduated from Yale who has

00:28:59.896 --> 00:29:04.000
worked her way up to a high
level inside the agency.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.328
And she refers to EPA's parking
lot.

00:29:06.328 --> 00:29:09.618
And the parking lot is a place
where EPA stores chemicals,

00:29:09.618 --> 00:29:11.108
not literally,
but figuratively,

00:29:11.108 --> 00:29:14.086
when it decides it's not going
to take any regulatory action on

00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:14.519
them.
 

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:18.078
So atrazine was put in the
parking lot,

00:29:18.078 --> 00:29:21.425
so to speak,
receiving little attention for

00:29:21.425 --> 00:29:24.652
much of the 1980s,
when these data came out,

00:29:24.652 --> 00:29:28.380
when people realized that the
concentrations were going up.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.778
When the parking lot fills up
with additional chemicals,

00:29:31.778 --> 00:29:36.064
it basically means that the
chemicals take longer and longer

00:29:36.064 --> 00:29:39.404
to receive review,
and you have a lower and lower

00:29:39.404 --> 00:29:43.096
probability that health-based
standards are going to be set in

00:29:43.096 --> 00:29:46.788
response to new evidence of
serious contamination or risk.

00:29:46.788 --> 00:29:51.125
Another problem with atrazine
is that it's structurally so

00:29:51.125 --> 00:29:55.309
similar to other kinds of
herbicides, including simazine

00:29:55.309 --> 00:29:56.680
and propazine.
 

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.818
And it produces similar
chlorinated metabolites.

00:30:00.818 --> 00:30:04.845
Metabolites are byproducts that
the compound,

00:30:04.845 --> 00:30:08.230
the original compound,
breaks into.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:12.467
That it makes sense to think
about how we might be exposed to

00:30:12.467 --> 00:30:16.138
clusters of these compounds,
instead of treating them

00:30:16.138 --> 00:30:17.338
individually.
 

00:30:17.338 --> 00:30:21.656
So remember my argument earlier
that EPA's attention is focused

00:30:21.656 --> 00:30:23.118
chemical at a time.
 

00:30:23.118 --> 00:30:26.105
So they'll make a decision on
atrazine without thinking about

00:30:26.105 --> 00:30:27.298
simazine or propazine.
 

00:30:27.298 --> 00:30:30.818
But in terms of your exposure,
in terms of its behavior inside

00:30:30.818 --> 00:30:33.724
your body,
there is a presumption that

00:30:33.724 --> 00:30:38.756
chemicals that are so similar in
structure will behave similarly

00:30:38.756 --> 00:30:42.108
in your body and pose a similar
threat.

00:30:42.108 --> 00:30:44.987
So as a society,
we want the government to pay

00:30:44.987 --> 00:30:48.487
attention to these mixtures,
particularly if there's a

00:30:48.487 --> 00:30:52.068
plausible reason that we might
be exposed to the mixtures.

00:30:52.068 --> 00:30:55.838
So in 1991, the MCL was set at
three parts per billion.

00:30:55.838 --> 00:30:59.338
And the MCLG was set at three
parts per billion as well.

00:30:59.338 --> 00:31:03.865
And the compliance was
determined based upon a running

00:31:03.865 --> 00:31:07.794
annual average,
with quarterly samples required

00:31:07.794 --> 00:31:11.038
by EPA or a single average
sample.

00:31:11.038 --> 00:31:14.310
Also in the late 1980s,
this was classified as a

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.259
possible human carcinogen.
 

00:31:16.259 --> 00:31:21.112
But then the Environmental
Protection Agency reviewed it as

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:23.788
not a likely human carcinogen.
 

00:31:23.788 --> 00:31:25.848
Now, how do they make these
choices?

00:31:25.848 --> 00:31:30.213
Well, they submit evidence to
what they call a scientific

00:31:30.213 --> 00:31:31.538
advisory panel.
 

00:31:31.538 --> 00:31:35.940
And I've had the experience of
sitting on EPA scientific

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:40.098
advisory panels for nearly a
decade and reviewing new

00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:41.779
evidence of risk.
 

00:31:41.779 --> 00:31:45.571
And the decision on the part of
the panel to recommend a

00:31:45.571 --> 00:31:49.296
classification as a carcinogen
or not a carcinogen or a

00:31:49.296 --> 00:31:52.400
chemical of high concern or low
concern,

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:56.634
it really depends very much
upon who is asked to sit on the

00:31:56.634 --> 00:31:58.680
scientific advisory panel.
 

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.416
And I want to recommend to you
the work of a professor at

00:32:02.416 --> 00:32:04.220
Harvard, Sheila Jasanoff.
 

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.558
Sheila came here as a visiting
professor for a while.

00:32:07.558 --> 00:32:11.382
And her work has been very
important on what she calls the

00:32:11.382 --> 00:32:14.801
fifth branch of government,
which are these advisory

00:32:14.801 --> 00:32:15.538
panels.
 

00:32:15.538 --> 00:32:19.131
So evidence is often so complex
that an agency is not really

00:32:19.131 --> 00:32:21.140
clear what they're going to do.
 

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.920
Is the risk higher?
 

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.990
Is it lower?
 

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.940
Should we regulate?
 

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.920
Should we just warn people?
 

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.230
How are we going to manage this
chemical?

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:32.016
They'll submit this question to
a scientific advisory panel to

00:32:32.016 --> 00:32:32.930
gain their advice.
 

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:37.067
Well, the political makeup of
these panels makes a terrific

00:32:37.067 --> 00:32:40.279
difference in guiding the
ultimate outcome.

00:32:40.279 --> 00:32:42.630
So the Food and Drug
Administration,

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.640
the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration,

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.984
EPA, most regulatory agencies
rely very heavily on these

00:32:47.984 --> 00:32:49.750
scientific advisory panels.
 

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:52.920
But just because a scientific
advisory panel makes a

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.717
recommendation,
doesn't mean that you ought to

00:32:55.717 --> 00:32:56.650
believe it.
 

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:00.299
Prior regulation,
they looked at the chemical

00:33:00.299 --> 00:33:04.778
more intensely and they found
that prior regulation was

00:33:04.778 --> 00:33:06.190
insufficient.
 

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:10.460
So that they deleted rangeland
millet in pineapple uses.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.318
So instead of prohibiting the
chemical outright,

00:33:13.318 --> 00:33:15.150
they would look at the
particular uses,

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:19.140
probably uses that did not have
a very high economic value,

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.933
and decided to go after those
to prohibit or further restrict

00:33:22.933 --> 00:33:23.440
those.
 

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.028
They also used what they called
a restricted-use classification.

00:33:26.028 --> 00:33:29.165
And pesticide law,
FIFRA, the acronym Federal

00:33:29.165 --> 00:33:32.230
Insecticide, Fungicide,
and Rodenticide Act,

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.509
it has this restricted-use
classification.

00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:37.078
And this is an interesting idea.
 

00:33:37.078 --> 00:33:41.096
I was telling a section last
night that it's similar to the

00:33:41.096 --> 00:33:42.690
idea of a pharmacist.
 

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.156
In other words,
in the world of

00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:48.708
pharmaceuticals,
we had this intervening layer

00:33:48.708 --> 00:33:52.136
of expertise so that the
pharmacist plays a role of

00:33:52.136 --> 00:33:56.318
interpreting exactly what the
appropriate dose is for you.

00:33:56.318 --> 00:34:00.788
So the physician doesn't give
you the drug directly normally.

00:34:00.788 --> 00:34:03.140
Although this happens in a
hospital often.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.260
But in a pharmacy,
you get access to a chemical

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:10.333
that poses certain risks because
experts are there behind the

00:34:10.333 --> 00:34:14.675
counter to make sure that you're
getting the proper dose and that

00:34:14.675 --> 00:34:18.679
you understand that there could
be drug interactions or that

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:22.547
there may be certain side
effects that you should be aware

00:34:22.547 --> 00:34:23.429
of.
 

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:27.585
So this same concept was built
into pesticide law,

00:34:27.585 --> 00:34:32.929
but in a very different way of
training licensed applicators.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:37.070
So if a chemical is classified
as being restricted use because

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:41.210
it is more toxic or it's more
persistent or it poses a certain

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:45.215
kind of a health threat,
then someone has to be trained

00:34:45.215 --> 00:34:48.199
before they're allowed legally
to apply it.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:52.684
And within the pesticide
regulations there is a provision

00:34:52.684 --> 00:34:56.530
so that supposing I went and I
got my license.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:00.889
So I was licensed to apply
dangerous pesticides,

00:35:00.889 --> 00:35:04.264
particularly in,
say, restricted areas that were

00:35:04.264 --> 00:35:08.789
ecologically vulnerable or maybe
inside schools or hospitals.

00:35:08.789 --> 00:35:12.045
So that I have the legal
authority to delegate that

00:35:12.045 --> 00:35:13.610
responsibility to you.
 

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:18.929
And if you have no training at
all, makes no difference.

00:35:18.929 --> 00:35:21.829
And I would tell you what to
do, I would tell you to follow

00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:23.730
the label directions very
carefully.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:27.268
But remember what I was saying
about literacy and background

00:35:27.268 --> 00:35:27.929
literacy.
 

00:35:27.929 --> 00:35:33.695
So how do you mix say a quarter
ounce of a toxic substance in,

00:35:33.695 --> 00:35:38.893
say water or in kerosene or
some other solvent that it's

00:35:38.893 --> 00:35:41.730
supposed to be sprayed in?
 

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.847
And how do you know that you've
got exactly the right

00:35:43.847 --> 00:35:44.500
concentration?
 

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.300
Well, it takes some
mathematical skill to do that.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:51.063
And I've run across a couple of
cases that I was describing last

00:35:51.063 --> 00:35:54.530
evening where people that were
delegated this authority not

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.039
only had a minimum level of
literacy,

00:35:57.039 --> 00:36:01.632
but also had virtually no
mathematical capacity to make

00:36:01.632 --> 00:36:03.929
these kinds of judgments.
 

00:36:03.929 --> 00:36:08.148
So EPA realized this eventually
and they started requiring

00:36:08.148 --> 00:36:11.480
containers that were in a sense
foolproof,

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.599
so that you would tip it,
they call it a tip-and-pour

00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:16.550
mechanism.
 

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:21.112
So you could pour out only the
correct proportion of the active

00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:22.070
ingredient.
 

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.842
And then all you had to figure
out was whether or not you had

00:36:25.842 --> 00:36:27.980
to add one or two gallons to it.
 

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.389
So this reduced the error rate.
 

00:36:29.389 --> 00:36:32.119
But if you are spraying a
pesticide,

00:36:32.119 --> 00:36:35.248
as an example,
and you've got a backpack on

00:36:35.248 --> 00:36:39.809
and you've got a spray wand,
I mean, I could be spraying the

00:36:39.809 --> 00:36:42.639
edge of this podium and walking
along.

00:36:42.639 --> 00:36:44.280
My cell phone could ring.
 

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.329
I could stop.
 

00:36:45.329 --> 00:36:48.369
I could look at my watch,
and then I could move on.

00:36:48.369 --> 00:36:51.440
And the effect would be what?
 

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.804
Well, when I looked at my
watch, wherever the wand was

00:36:53.804 --> 00:36:55.664
pointing,
it would get a dose that

00:36:55.664 --> 00:36:58.643
probably would be dozens of
times higher than if I were

00:36:58.643 --> 00:37:00.190
walking in a uniform way.
 

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:04.382
There's kind of an interesting
analog to that with respect to

00:37:04.382 --> 00:37:06.268
spray planes or tractors.
 

00:37:06.268 --> 00:37:11.057
So you can imagine a tractor
that has a bar across the back

00:37:11.057 --> 00:37:15.268
end with holes on it,
such as it's going to irrigate

00:37:15.268 --> 00:37:16.260
a field.
 

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:21.510
Well, the truck goes along,
gets to the end of the field.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.829
It turns around,
comes back this way.

00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:26.099
And eventually,
it covers the entire field.

00:37:26.099 --> 00:37:29.170
Well, if it has the same
application rate,

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:34.360
the same emission rate from the
pipe regardless of the speed of

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.894
the truck,
where in the field are you

00:37:36.894 --> 00:37:39.119
going to get the higher
concentrations?

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:43.704
At the ends of the field,
where the truck slows to turn

00:37:43.704 --> 00:37:44.469
around.
 

00:37:44.469 --> 00:37:49.382
Similarly, if you can think
about spray plane coming in and

00:37:49.382 --> 00:37:54.889
spraying the hypothetical field,
which is the platform up here.

00:37:54.889 --> 00:37:57.822
They pass this way,
then they come back and they

00:37:57.822 --> 00:37:59.010
pass another way.
 

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.083
I've seen farm workers in
California standing there with

00:38:02.083 --> 00:38:05.436
just shorts and a straw hat on
kind of waving as a marker for

00:38:05.436 --> 00:38:08.360
the spray plane,
being sprayed repeatedly.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.248
There's an occupational side to
pesticide control that I don't

00:38:11.248 --> 00:38:12.670
have time to express to you.
 

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:18.070
But then you get this overlap
of the spray in the field.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.817
So these kinds of practical
conditions have a really

00:38:21.817 --> 00:38:26.518
important implication for how
you set up your sampling design.

00:38:26.518 --> 00:38:30.257
So if you sampled in the middle
of the field that was treated by

00:38:30.257 --> 00:38:31.724
the truck,
or the tractor,

00:38:31.724 --> 00:38:34.369
you're going to get a lower
level of concentration than if

00:38:34.369 --> 00:38:36.179
you sampled at the end of the
field.

00:38:36.179 --> 00:38:40.621
The same may be the case with
respect to spray planes and the

00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:42.768
way that they spray fields.
 

00:38:42.768 --> 00:38:48.302
So the dance of regulation is
one where the government will

00:38:48.302 --> 00:38:49.822
say,
"Look, we've got to cut

00:38:49.822 --> 00:38:51.804
back your use,
we have to protect the water or

00:38:51.804 --> 00:38:53.780
we want to reduce worker
exposure."

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.744
And the industry that
manufactures it will say,

00:38:56.744 --> 00:38:58.550
"Well, you know what?
 

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:02.849
Don't cut back in this area,
cut back and restrict its use

00:39:02.849 --> 00:39:07.150
on a specific commodity,"
probably one that is not an

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.320
economically productive one for
them,

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.090
or particular kind of use.
 

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:16.402
So the argument about what uses
are restricted as opposed to

00:39:16.402 --> 00:39:19.940
which ones are prohibited gets
quite technical quite quickly.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.291
So if a chemical comes back as
a recognized,

00:39:22.291 --> 00:39:25.684
serious threat to human health,
that doesn't mean it's going to

00:39:25.684 --> 00:39:26.670
be prohibited.
 

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.860
Prohibition is very unlikely.
 

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.978
I mean, there have been so few
bans in environmental history,

00:39:32.978 --> 00:39:37.030
probably fewer than 300 bans,
outright bans of chemicals.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:38.896
I've talked to you about a
couple of them,

00:39:38.896 --> 00:39:39.989
DDT is a good example.
 

00:39:39.989 --> 00:39:45.800
And aldrin and chlordane,
these are all pesticides.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.650
But for the vast majority of
compounds,

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:52.047
instead, you get this minor
revision in the way the chemical

00:39:52.047 --> 00:39:54.179
is allowed to be mixed or
applied,

00:39:54.179 --> 00:39:56.349
it's put into the
restricted-use category.

00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:59.731
It's allowed to be used on corn
but not on other crops,

00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:02.550
so that the market share can be
maintained.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:06.494
Here's a graph of the seasonal
pulse of atrazine in water

00:40:06.494 --> 00:40:10.510
supplies that was recognized in
the Midwestern part of the

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:11.780
United States.
 

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.320
You can't see the years here,
but this is 1995,1996,

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.389
1997,1998.
 

00:40:17.389 --> 00:40:19.010
And you see this pulse.
 

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:22.523
Because they apply it in the
spring and then the rains will

00:40:22.523 --> 00:40:25.309
wash it into the surrounding
water supplies.

00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:28.514
Well, so another sampling
design issue here that really is

00:40:28.514 --> 00:40:31.775
critical to the effectiveness of
the statute is that if you

00:40:31.775 --> 00:40:35.204
decided that you were going to
sample say in September of each

00:40:35.204 --> 00:40:37.980
year,
you're going to miss this pulse.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:43.507
So it's only by sitting down
and thinking about the method of

00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:47.036
application,
the timing of the application,

00:40:47.036 --> 00:40:51.257
and thinking about it in a more
systems or ecological manner

00:40:51.257 --> 00:40:55.090
that considers climate,
that you would be able to pick

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:55.659
this up.
 

00:40:55.659 --> 00:41:00.184
There was a very legal debate
as well about what this chemical

00:41:00.184 --> 00:41:02.409
is doing, where it's moving.
 

00:41:02.409 --> 00:41:04.139
And the U.S.
 

00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:06.954
Geological Service found that
it travels actually hundreds of

00:41:06.954 --> 00:41:08.690
miles from its site of
application.

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:11.510
So it's running off the fields,
it's getting into streams,

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.630
and it's getting into rivers,
such as the Mississippi River,

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.219
and it's moving long distances.
 

00:41:16.219 --> 00:41:21.119
So this study found that some
states were receiving fifty

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:25.670
percent of their pollution load
from out of state.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:30.436
So if atrazine is reaching say,
Louisiana but we know that it's

00:41:30.436 --> 00:41:34.380
not applied in Louisiana,
what right do they have to sue

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.543
the Environmental Protection
Agency for the failure to

00:41:37.543 --> 00:41:40.469
regulate that chemical's
application up in Ohio or

00:41:40.469 --> 00:41:42.260
Illinois or in Minnesota?
 

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:47.250
And they do have the authority
to sue the Environmental

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:52.610
Protection Agency or particular
chemical companies that are

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.090
responsible.
 

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:58.324
So this trans-boundary movement
of these chemicals raises a very

00:41:58.324 --> 00:41:59.400
serious issue.
 

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.036
And also, you've got to think
about the fact that many of

00:42:02.036 --> 00:42:04.768
these cities get their water
supplies from these rivers.

00:42:04.768 --> 00:42:09.047
And they use filtration systems
that do not have the capacity to

00:42:09.047 --> 00:42:12.239
extract many of the pesticides
that are used.

00:42:12.239 --> 00:42:15.679
So water is typically filtered
by running it through sand to

00:42:15.679 --> 00:42:17.429
take out particulate matter.
 

00:42:17.429 --> 00:42:19.469
Then it's treated with chlorine.
 

00:42:19.469 --> 00:42:23.057
It's not normally treated with
activated carbon,

00:42:23.057 --> 00:42:25.960
which could bind to these
chemicals.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.461
Now, that should ring bells in
your head if you're concerned

00:42:29.461 --> 00:42:32.608
about your own water intake,
because water is the most

00:42:32.608 --> 00:42:34.449
consumed food in your diet.
 

00:42:34.449 --> 00:42:37.708
It should ring a bell that you
should be concerned about the

00:42:37.708 --> 00:42:41.242
quality of water in your tap and
you should think carefully about

00:42:41.242 --> 00:42:44.170
the wisdom of using activated
carbon at the tap,

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:50.284
because it's not likely that
the government has kept it

00:42:50.284 --> 00:42:52.210
perfectly safe.
 

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:56.527
So I'm going to scoot ahead
here with one final aspect of

00:42:56.527 --> 00:42:57.530
this story.
 

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:01.740
The atmospheric transport of
some of these chemicals was a

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.067
surprise to many,
inside the agency as well as

00:43:05.067 --> 00:43:07.210
the scientific community.
 

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:11.829
I ran into this in California,
when I found that a chemical,

00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:15.766
dibromochloropropane,
that had been injected into the

00:43:15.766 --> 00:43:20.733
soil in cotton fields,
had actually volatilized and

00:43:20.733 --> 00:43:23.369
gotten up into the fog.
 

00:43:23.369 --> 00:43:24.860
Anybody here from the Central
Valley?

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:28.824
Well, the Central Valley of
California, which is sandwiched

00:43:28.824 --> 00:43:31.969
between the coastal range and
then the Sierras,

00:43:31.969 --> 00:43:34.909
is a flat basin,
it's a former lakebed.

00:43:34.909 --> 00:43:37.893
And climatologically,
it's interesting because a fog

00:43:37.893 --> 00:43:41.228
will settle on that area and
stay there for a good part of

00:43:41.228 --> 00:43:43.295
January,
sometimes December,

00:43:43.295 --> 00:43:44.670
six to eight weeks.
 

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:49.643
So what they found was DBCP was
actually volatilizing and it was

00:43:49.643 --> 00:43:51.539
detectable in the fog.
 

00:43:51.539 --> 00:43:55.239
They found toxaphene that had
been applied in Texas in the

00:43:55.239 --> 00:43:56.150
Great Lakes.
 

00:43:56.150 --> 00:44:00.210
Then they found atrazine in the
Great Lakes as well.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:04.753
So point six percent of
atrazine is deposited,

00:44:04.753 --> 00:44:07.579
in one study,
in rainfall.

00:44:07.579 --> 00:44:11.313
And the concentration of
atrazine in precipitation in

00:44:11.313 --> 00:44:15.407
some areas where it had not been
applied, was one part per

00:44:15.407 --> 00:44:16.268
billion.
 

00:44:16.268 --> 00:44:20.079
And what did I tell you the
maximum contaminant level was?

00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:22.969
Three parts per billion.
 

00:44:22.969 --> 00:44:24.760
Fairly striking.
 

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:29.106
So it's moving long distances
in clouds and raining down and

00:44:29.106 --> 00:44:33.748
perhaps acting as a pre-emergent
herbicide to areas where it was

00:44:33.748 --> 00:44:35.960
never intended to be used.
 

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.485
So the degradation of the
chemical in aquatic environments

00:44:39.485 --> 00:44:41.280
is increasingly of concern.
 

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.139
The half-life is between
forty-one and 237 days.

00:44:45.139 --> 00:44:49.018
An average half-life of the
chemical of 159 days.

00:44:49.018 --> 00:44:53.853
And Lake Michigan is a
repository for atrazine because

00:44:53.853 --> 00:44:56.427
of its use,
particularly in Minnesota and

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:58.132
Michigan,
Indiana, Ohio,

00:44:58.132 --> 00:45:01.768
and the pattern of rainfall in
that area.

00:45:01.768 --> 00:45:05.679
So it's cold water,
it's low productivity,

00:45:05.679 --> 00:45:07.260
it's high pH,
low nitrate,

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.746
and low dissolved oxygen,
all contribute to increased

00:45:10.746 --> 00:45:12.590
persistence of the chemical.
 

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:15.329
So the estimated half-life in
Lake Michigan is about

00:45:15.329 --> 00:45:16.349
thirty-one years.
 

00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:20.291
So EPA conducted a study that
found that when they tried to

00:45:20.291 --> 00:45:24.096
figure out what the mass balance
was of atrazine or is of

00:45:24.096 --> 00:45:24.980
atrazine.
 

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:30.724
So atmospheric wet deposition
is about 2,493 kilograms per

00:45:30.724 --> 00:45:31.429
year.
 

00:45:31.429 --> 00:45:35.579
The watershed loading directly
and surface water runoff to the

00:45:35.579 --> 00:45:38.369
lake is about 5,000 kilograms
per year.

00:45:38.369 --> 00:45:43.833
2,500 kilograms exported to
Lake Huron and exported to

00:45:43.833 --> 00:45:49.090
Chicago by water diversions,
a more minor amount.

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:52.320
And even the lake itself is
volatilizing the chemical.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:56.748
So recognizing that the
agricultural practice of using

00:45:56.748 --> 00:46:01.594
atrazine as an herbicide and
EPA's neglect of this compound

00:46:01.594 --> 00:46:06.440
and misunderstanding of its
ecological behavior could cause

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:10.869
a gradual buildup to 182,000
kilograms of the compound

00:46:10.869 --> 00:46:13.210
sitting in the lake.
 

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.440
It was really quite striking.
 

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:20.568
So I'm going to just pause with
reflections on the work of

00:46:20.568 --> 00:46:24.427
Tyrone Hayes,
who is a former chemical

00:46:24.427 --> 00:46:27.751
company employee,
a scientist who worked for

00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:28.380
Syngenta.
 

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:32.449
And Tyrone Hayes has been
responsible for some

00:46:32.449 --> 00:46:34.349
controversial work.
 

00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:39.070
So he took his students and he
rented a tractor-trailer.

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:42.407
And they drove across the
country, taking a look at the

00:46:42.407 --> 00:46:45.250
concentrations of atrazine in
leopard frogs.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:49.699
And what was interesting about
his finding, because he sampled

00:46:49.699 --> 00:46:53.931
from areas of the country where
the leopard frogs lived but

00:46:53.931 --> 00:46:55.829
atrazine was not used.
 

00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:58.956
And then he went into the heart
of the Midwestern atrazine-use

00:46:58.956 --> 00:47:00.699
belt and sampled in those areas.
 

00:47:00.699 --> 00:47:05.684
And he found obviously higher
concentrations in the areas

00:47:05.684 --> 00:47:09.777
where it was used,
but he also found that these

00:47:09.777 --> 00:47:13.159
frogs had both ovaries and
testes.

00:47:13.159 --> 00:47:17.972
So his argument that this
chemical is hormonally active,

00:47:17.972 --> 00:47:21.300
at least in the African clawed
frog.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.704
And he also is claiming that
there are important lessons here

00:47:25.704 --> 00:47:30.181
for humans, that this compound
could be also hormonally active

00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:31.210
in humans.
 

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:35.032
"So atrazine (he argues)
in exposed males that have

00:47:35.032 --> 00:47:39.409
ovaries in their testes also had
much smaller larynxes."

00:47:39.409 --> 00:47:42.159
And larynxes are important if
you're a frog,

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:45.172
because it's a way that you can
understand where other frogs are

00:47:45.172 --> 00:47:47.994
or other frogs can understand
where you are for reproductive

00:47:47.994 --> 00:47:48.570
success.
 

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:52.699
And it's also recognized to
lower the testosterone levels in

00:47:52.699 --> 00:47:53.260
frogs.
 

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:57.009
So I'm not going to go further
today, other than to suggest

00:47:57.009 --> 00:48:00.501
that there's a whole emerging
area of concern now about

00:48:00.501 --> 00:48:02.570
hormonally active compounds.
 

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:06.159
And atrazine is a good compound
to pay attention to.

00:48:06.159 --> 00:48:08.130
Okay, that's it for today.
 

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:09.500
Thank you very much.
 

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:16.000

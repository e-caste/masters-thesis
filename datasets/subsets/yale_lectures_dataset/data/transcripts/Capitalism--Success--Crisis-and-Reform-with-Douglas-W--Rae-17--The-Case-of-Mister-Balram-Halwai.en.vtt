00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.844
Prof: Well,
this is what a well-worn copy

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:06.970
of White Tiger looks
like.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.440
The style of it is pretty
striking.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:24.447
Anybody want to take a shot at
other novels that it remind you

00:00:24.447 --> 00:00:25.350
of?
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.350
Yeah.
 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.620
Student: 
&gt;

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.620
Prof: Not the cover.
 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.974
Student:  It reminds me
of Salman Rushdie's

00:00:33.974 --> 00:00:35.960
Midnight's Children.
 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.605
Prof: Okay,
that's one interesting

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:40.790
suggestion.
 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.470
Sophie Quinton, where are you?
 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.110
What do you think?
 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.618
Student:  What do I
think of the book,

00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:54.153
or is this related to the warm
call email you sent me the other

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:54.610
day?
 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.280
Prof: The warm call.
 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.354
Student:  Well in the
back of White Tiger

00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:01.770
there's sort of reading group
discussion with the author,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.801
and one of the thing's the
author says that is kind of

00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:07.890
interesting is that his
inspiration for Balram was--

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.227
he's sort of a composite
character that came out of the

00:01:11.227 --> 00:01:15.430
author's experience just hanging
out in slums and train stations,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.140
and in servants quarters,
and listening to what,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.760
basically, the underclass of
India are saying,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.810
and how they are thinking,
and it's sort of--

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.188
it's interesting that Balram,
who's such an angry character,

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:31.549
is the embodiment of something
very real that Adiga,

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.830
I guess, felt talking to people
on the streets.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.209
Prof: Okay that's good.
 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:43.494
In the--he also mentions three
American novelists in the back,

00:01:43.494 --> 00:01:45.400
did you notice that?
 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.239
Student:  No, I did not.
 

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.180
Prof: Okay.
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.510
Well it's interesting,
the--I'll quote him--

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.644
the influences on White
Tiger are three black

00:01:55.644 --> 00:01:58.411
American writers of the post
World War II era:

00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:00.365
Ralph Ellison,
James Baldwin,

00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:01.489
and Richard Wright.
 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:08.632
It has many ways to look at it,
it is written in a very

00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:15.774
straightforward style that
is--each paragraph is pretty

00:02:15.774 --> 00:02:18.419
straightforward.
 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:24.959
The subtext about how it's
being told is a little more

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.754
complicated,
and one of the other things he

00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:33.211
says in the back which--
and this goes to the point

00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:36.586
Sophie made,
is that while none of the

00:02:36.586 --> 00:02:42.830
characters or incidents are
copied out of journalism,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.623
which is the author's business,
all of them are meant to be

00:02:47.623 --> 00:02:51.840
representative of something real
in Indian life,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.419
so that the book is literally
fiction,

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:01.250
but has a purpose like many of
the best works of fiction,

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.280
has a purpose of describing
something that is very real.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.738
Are there ways in which fiction
can do a better job than social

00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:13.360
science of telling the truth
about a country?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.250
Anybody got a thought about
that?

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.788
Yes?
 

00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:24.710
Student:  Well it's an
art form,

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.543
and something like social
science can't really say well

00:03:26.543 --> 00:03:29.417
this makes me feel this,
or this is like the nuance of

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:31.750
that,
and that's where art plays in.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.815
I mean--also,
I mean, it's mass media too in

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:35.785
a lot of ways,
so you can reach a lot more

00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:38.378
people through this and have it
easily understood.

00:03:38.378 --> 00:03:40.690
Prof: Okay,
its mass media,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.030
but it actually does something
that most non-fiction written by

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.245
academics can't do;
economists, political

00:03:48.245 --> 00:03:52.604
scientists, people like that,
by and large a little wooden

00:03:52.604 --> 00:03:56.810
and rigid, little category
bound, a little obsessed with

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.110
methodology.
 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.420
And this book covers a huge
swath of very complicated

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.161
aspects of a society which,
as far as I can tell,

00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:15.288
is top half dozen in the way of
complexity in the world.

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:21.620
I mean the structure of--the
historical structure of India

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.062
and the incredible rate of
economic and sociological change

00:04:28.062 --> 00:04:31.949
have very few equals elsewhere.
 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.180
Evia, have I got that name
right?

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:47.065
Again and again the concept of
the darkness comes up in the

00:04:47.065 --> 00:04:50.877
book;
help us to try to understand

00:04:50.877 --> 00:04:51.440
that.
 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.632
Student:  Yes I think
it's sort of literally and

00:04:54.632 --> 00:04:56.879
figuratively the darkness of
India,

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.053
the parts of India that have
sort of left behind in the all

00:04:59.053 --> 00:05:00.439
the development and
globalization,

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:02.990
where there's no electricity
so, like,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.139
literally it's dark when the
sun goes down,

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.459
and where there's also a lack
of like basic necessities,

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:10.459
like sanitation.
 

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:13.860
And, like, proper food,
and I think also the darkness

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.278
of sort of corruption and
bribery,

00:05:16.278 --> 00:05:19.069
and like, theoretically there
being resources,

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.000
but those getting funneled into
the hands of,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.286
like for example,
the great socialist whose

00:05:23.286 --> 00:05:26.610
campaign to sort of lift the
darkness out of the darkness,

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.584
but ended up just getting sort
of sucked into the bribery of

00:05:30.584 --> 00:05:34.627
people in the upper castes in
the town and continuing to take

00:05:34.627 --> 00:05:37.115
advantage of the lower caste,
like of the

00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:37.579
&gt;
 

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:41.560
Prof: From the point of
view of village India,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.875
deep in the darkness,
is it clear one way or the

00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:51.172
other whether the economic--
miracle may be too strong a

00:05:51.172 --> 00:05:56.351
word, but the incredible
progress in overall development

00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:59.930
that's been made since about
1990,

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.430
is a good thing or a bad thing?
 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.317
Student:  I think--like
I think it kind of goes both

00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:10.437
ways,
and I think he talks about it

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:13.358
in that--
I guess he sort of talks about

00:06:13.358 --> 00:06:18.625
it as the difference between the
north and the south or what like

00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:20.930
the two cities he was in.
 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.380
When development gets kind of
entrenched in corruption and

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.528
then it ends up being a bad
thing, and ends up taking

00:06:27.528 --> 00:06:29.829
advantage of people at the
bottom.

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:31.983
But I think,
to me, it seemed a little

00:06:31.983 --> 00:06:35.651
optimistic that it can be a good
thing in places where it's been

00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:36.699
done properly.
 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.791
Prof: Okay,
you have it in the back of your

00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:46.220
mind an idea or two about what
doing capitalism properly means?

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.850
Student:  Well not
really.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.959
I guess--
Prof: I'll bet you do.

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:53.278
Student:  You know not
corruption, not bribing

00:06:53.278 --> 00:06:55.620
policemen to--
Prof: Okay,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.120
not corruption,
not bribery.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.079
Student:  I mean
there--I don't know if

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:04.156
it's--there are I guess a lot of
things but I think that's what

00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:05.209
he tells us.
 

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:07.088
Prof: Now let's go on
and we'll find some of them.

00:07:07.088 --> 00:07:16.442
Sudir--there's a passage in--I
think it's the first night in

00:07:16.442 --> 00:07:22.942
the book about--I think it's
four animals,

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.319
am I right?
 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:26.670
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.670
Prof: Who represent
people--can you help us with it?

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.761
Student:  Sure I
think--the first point is that

00:07:32.761 --> 00:07:34.920
Adiga's making a statement of
how--

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.379
and quite unabashedly,
landowners as animals,

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:39.968
who in this case quite
literally feed off

00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:41.040
&gt;
 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.100
physical and human resources.
 

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.807
The other obvious point is that
the animal's Adiga chooses to

00:07:46.807 --> 00:07:50.269
represent the landlords aren't
particularly glamorous.

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:53.639
I think he has a view of
landowners as tacky,

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.372
crass, lazy,
and it's clear that one of the

00:07:56.372 --> 00:08:00.538
few reasons or main reasons that
they hold a position of power in

00:08:00.538 --> 00:08:03.987
society is they've probably
descended from families of

00:08:03.987 --> 00:08:07.826
landowners who have a long kind
of history of exploiting and

00:08:07.826 --> 00:08:09.910
extorting from the poor.
 

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.500
Prof: Okay.
 

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.970
Now here's an interesting
parallel.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.110
If you think about the--about
Clark's Farewell To Alms,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:23.651
one of the big lessons there is
that land is the primary basis

00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:29.339
of economic return in pre-modern
societies,

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:33.610
and loses its relative standing
with development.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:39.808
If Adiga is right are the
stork, the raven,

00:08:39.808 --> 00:08:44.090
the wild boar and who else?
 

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.070
Student:  Buffalo.
 

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.581
Prof: And the
buffalo--are they basically

00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:52.764
fossils of a previous era
grasping for the last straws of

00:08:52.764 --> 00:08:57.642
a powerbase that will go away,
or given the nature of rural

00:08:57.642 --> 00:09:02.167
India will they persist in that
position generation after

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.418
generation,
do you think?

00:09:04.418 --> 00:09:09.447
Student:  You know it's
hard for me to kind of identify

00:09:09.447 --> 00:09:13.649
the trajectory of India's
development persisted--

00:09:13.649 --> 00:09:18.302
I don't know how much of--I
guess I mean rural India is a

00:09:18.302 --> 00:09:21.125
large--
makes a large chunk of the

00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:23.988
country and the economy,
for what it's worth,

00:09:23.988 --> 00:09:27.010
so I think there are probably,
in the foreseeable future,

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.736
there's probably a very good
chance that characters like

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:34.869
these four will still retain a
good deal of influence in those

00:09:34.869 --> 00:09:35.750
spheres.
 

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.769
I mean obviously corporations
are making their way into

00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:43.379
these--
into rural areas and setting up

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:46.889
innovation camps and large
offices,

00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:53.129
but to the extent that India
is--the rural base is strong,

00:09:53.129 --> 00:09:55.120
I think these people will
thrive.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.969
Prof: Okay,
and if capitalism seeks

00:09:59.969 --> 00:10:04.700
economies of scale as its want
to do,

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:12.519
small landholding will be
eventually undermined by

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:21.114
large-scale landholding,
and agricultural development on

00:10:21.114 --> 00:10:23.048
a vast scale.
 

00:10:23.048 --> 00:10:25.808
That would be the textbook
hypothesis.

00:10:25.808 --> 00:10:28.950
If you look at what's happening
in Brazil,

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:33.692
for example,
development on the scale of

00:10:33.692 --> 00:10:39.649
farms twenty-five or thirty-five
miles square,

00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:44.950
twenty-five by twenty-five say,
is commonplace.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:49.572
Maybe India's different,
and the reason it may be

00:10:49.572 --> 00:10:53.038
different is that the
indigenous--

00:10:53.038 --> 00:10:57.210
the density of indigenous rural
population is much higher,

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:04.312
and the process by which land
would be aggregated may happen

00:11:04.312 --> 00:11:06.840
quite a lot slower.
 

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.028
Maximillian?
 

00:11:08.028 --> 00:11:13.181
Where did the title of the book
come from and how do you

00:11:13.181 --> 00:11:14.678
understand it?
 

00:11:14.678 --> 00:11:18.445
Student:  He calls it
The White Tiger

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:22.607
because Balram stands out of all
the other servants like a white

00:11:22.607 --> 00:11:26.006
tiger stands out of--
white tiger stands out of

00:11:26.006 --> 00:11:29.642
their--I don't know other
animals who are not albinos

00:11:29.642 --> 00:11:31.528
because they're so rare.
 

00:11:31.528 --> 00:11:36.548
There's one incident leading up
to Balram coming to white tiger

00:11:36.548 --> 00:11:40.105
that is,
I guess, where they are on the

00:11:40.105 --> 00:11:45.172
way with the two sons of his
masters to bribe the minister

00:11:45.172 --> 00:11:50.238
and Balram reaches out to a
beggar intuitively to help him

00:11:50.238 --> 00:11:56.408
and he gives him some money,
and the sons of his master get

00:11:56.408 --> 00:12:01.129
really angry with him giving him
the money,

00:12:01.129 --> 00:12:04.695
and they start to complain
about how many taxes they have

00:12:04.695 --> 00:12:08.259
to pay you and that they are
already helping the poor.

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:14.269
Yeah, that's how he realizes
that the entrenched inequalities

00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:19.976
in Indian society will perhaps
persist despite India's new

00:12:19.976 --> 00:12:21.480
prosperity.
 

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.769
Prof: Okay good.
 

00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:27.085
Do you remember the part about
the schoolhouse early on where

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:30.399
there's a surprise inspection,
does anybody remember this?

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:35.039
Am I drawing a blank here?
 

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:40.234
Over there--
Student:  Yeah in the

00:12:40.234 --> 00:12:45.450
beginning I believe there's a
surprise inspection and he's--

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:49.082
the inspector comes in an asks
the students a bunch of

00:12:49.082 --> 00:12:52.870
different questions,
and really nobody's able to

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.230
give any good answer except for
Balram,

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:00.509
and he then asks him,
I guess, what's the--

00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:02.470
he asks him a certain question.
 

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.628
I forget exactly what the
question is but the answer was

00:13:05.628 --> 00:13:08.500
that it's a White Tiger,
that's the most unique.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.427
Prof: Okay so he gets
named White Tiger for being

00:13:12.427 --> 00:13:16.500
uniquely talented in a situation
where talent is not being

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.500
developed.
 

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:23.139
How does the schoolroom
operate, do you remember that?

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:25.698
Student:  Well it's
interesting that Balram didn't

00:13:25.698 --> 00:13:29.013
actually blame the teacher,
because I guess the teacher

00:13:29.013 --> 00:13:33.620
like would steal the uniforms
and all the resources that came,

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.120
but I think the one point
Balram even says,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.288
like, well, I mean,
no one really blames him

00:13:38.288 --> 00:13:42.269
because his payment also gets
taken by someone else.

00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:45.971
So the teacher--there's just
like a chain of corruption that

00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:49.863
ends and the teacher basically
stealing the resources that were

00:13:49.863 --> 00:13:53.190
meant for the kids and just
sleeping all day or--

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.908
and while the kids do whatever.
 

00:13:54.908 --> 00:13:57.693
Prof: Okay
they're--quite often there's a

00:13:57.693 --> 00:14:01.070
mention of the fact that the
teacher was snoring while the

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.210
students were supposed to be
learning somehow from one

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.039
another.
 

00:14:05.039 --> 00:14:08.690
You're right in that.
 

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.482
I think the narrator says
something like,

00:14:11.482 --> 00:14:15.741
"Those who live in a dung
heap can't be expected to smell

00:14:15.741 --> 00:14:16.789
well."
 

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:17.629
Student:  Right.
 

00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:22.200
Prof: So there's a kind
of environmental

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.970
explanation--social
environmental explanation.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:27.629
What do we think?
 

00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:35.755
Is this a man bites dog story,
or is corruption a fairly major

00:14:35.755 --> 00:14:39.220
issue in Indian society?
 

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:45.570
Who's got an opinion?
 

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.913
Student:  I think it's a
fairly major issue because even

00:14:48.913 --> 00:14:52.308
when you make the transition
into the lightness in the book,

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:55.480
you still get severe corruption
of course with--

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.133
you know the--Balram's boss
going to give the big bags of

00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:00.830
money to the government.
 

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.548
So I think it's corruption that
pervades every level,

00:15:03.548 --> 00:15:07.096
and kind of the light is a
little bit of a deceptive name

00:15:07.096 --> 00:15:10.707
for what Balram was into because
even at the height of his

00:15:10.707 --> 00:15:14.254
success the only way he can
succeed is by killing someone

00:15:14.254 --> 00:15:16.980
and then by paying off the
policeman.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.533
Prof: Okay,
that's elegantly put but its

00:15:20.533 --> 00:15:23.470
evidence from fiction about
fiction.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:28.964
What--the judgment I'm looking
for is, is his claim that the

00:15:28.964 --> 00:15:35.110
book represents broadly truthful
patterns in the society or not?

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.710
You buy it or not?
 

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.178
Student:  Well I mean
having--

00:15:39.178 --> 00:15:40.470
I was in India myself several
times,

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.340
and having many friends from
there,

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.256
I've definitely heard
considerable stories of

00:15:45.256 --> 00:15:46.120
corruption.
 

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.356
I mean I'm not in a position to
judge the society as a whole but

00:15:49.356 --> 00:15:52.029
it seems like it would have an
element of truth to it

00:15:52.029 --> 00:15:52.750
certainly.
 

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.933
Prof: Okay,
has anybody glanced at one of

00:15:54.933 --> 00:15:58.948
the world rankings from,
say, Transparency International

00:15:58.948 --> 00:16:04.288
or other organizations which
evaluate levels of corruption?

00:16:04.288 --> 00:16:08.120
Okay the Socratic Method stops
here.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:16.534
India is near the top of the
world table in corruption as an

00:16:16.534 --> 00:16:24.379
issue perceived by people in
business as problematic.

00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:32.977
Anybody with substantial
experience want to contradict or

00:16:32.977 --> 00:16:36.970
elaborate on this point?
 

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.058
Yes.
 

00:16:39.058 --> 00:16:42.620
We need a microphone in the
middle.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.610
Student:  For large part
of people staying in India,

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.871
especially doing business
there, corruption has almost

00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:51.152
become a way of life,
so they see it--they'd rather

00:16:51.152 --> 00:16:54.259
call the system flexible than
calling it corrupt.

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:57.158
If you want to get a government
sanction,

00:16:57.158 --> 00:16:58.798
which would generally take
three months,

00:16:58.798 --> 00:17:02.378
you can get it done in three
days if you pay an additional

00:17:02.378 --> 00:17:05.842
amount and that's the premium--
that's the premium not

00:17:05.842 --> 00:17:09.701
corruption, so for a large part
of the society it's a flexible

00:17:09.701 --> 00:17:12.170
system rather than a corrupt
system.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.387
Prof: Okay,
and the good American economist

00:17:15.387 --> 00:17:16.440
would call it?
 

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.451
Student:  The
efficiencies in the market that

00:17:18.451 --> 00:17:19.278
is exploiting them.
 

00:17:19.278 --> 00:17:22.476
Prof: Inefficiencies due
to rent-seeking,

00:17:22.476 --> 00:17:23.019
right?
 

00:17:23.019 --> 00:17:24.160
Student:  Exactly.
 

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:30.828
Prof: Rent seeking,
I love the concept.

00:17:30.828 --> 00:17:33.680
Danielle , right on the--are
you here Danielle?

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:39.598
Hi, Dr.***Rampundi is it, Pambi?
 

00:17:39.598 --> 00:17:40.230
Student:  Something like
that.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.108
Prof: Something like
that.

00:17:42.108 --> 00:17:45.383
Tell us about that incident in
the book and give us something

00:17:45.383 --> 00:17:47.130
about what you think it means.
 

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.673
Student:  Okay so on
page forty-one in the book

00:17:50.673 --> 00:17:52.763
there's--
when they're all sitting

00:17:52.763 --> 00:17:56.094
in--and the White Tiger has
taken his father to the hospital

00:17:56.094 --> 00:17:59.029
and they're sitting in the
waiting room waiting for a

00:17:59.029 --> 00:18:03.087
doctor who won't come,
and an old Muslim man starts

00:18:03.087 --> 00:18:07.250
telling a story about this
fictitious doctor,

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.644
Dr. Rampandi and he talks
about how the socialists sells

00:18:11.644 --> 00:18:15.160
off plots of like districts to
doctors,

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.868
and the doctors buy these
districts,

00:18:16.868 --> 00:18:20.670
almost like a feudal system,
and then the doctors in those

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.317
districts will--
he'll take part of the salaries

00:18:23.317 --> 00:18:26.309
from these doctors and then tell
them oh well now you can just go

00:18:26.309 --> 00:18:28.180
off and work for a private
hospital,

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.930
you don't have to worry about
these people,

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.470
I'll write it down in my ledger
that you've been there.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.608
Basically the government is on
a totally different strata,

00:18:35.608 --> 00:18:39.075
and all the money or benefits
just get written down or written

00:18:39.075 --> 00:18:41.417
away,
and these people are left dying

00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:43.865
or with wounded legs,
like the Muslim man,

00:18:43.865 --> 00:18:46.009
and he's just sort of laughing
about it.

00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:48.694
There's this sense like--with
the Muslim man and all the

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:51.429
people in the waiting room
they're sort of laughing about

00:18:51.429 --> 00:18:53.920
their problems or bragging about
them because--

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.284
I mean his father dies in the
end, Balram's father dies in the

00:18:57.284 --> 00:18:59.380
end because his doctor never
comes,

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:04.108
so the corruption and the
resources are just like strewn

00:19:04.108 --> 00:19:06.690
about and there's just that.
 

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.121
Prof: Okay,
now that passage is actually

00:19:10.121 --> 00:19:13.028
quite polemical the way it's
written.

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:16.711
It probably overstates,
right--there are probably a

00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:21.348
hell of lot of places where you
actually can see the doctor,

00:19:21.348 --> 00:19:24.234
and the doctor does pay
attention to people he's

00:19:24.234 --> 00:19:27.298
supposed to pay attention to,
but the general pattern

00:19:27.298 --> 00:19:32.269
described there--
what's wrong with corruption?

00:19:32.269 --> 00:19:36.865
Corruption--I mean,
it--there are serious people

00:19:36.865 --> 00:19:42.048
who think corruption is not
altogether a bad thing.

00:19:42.048 --> 00:19:44.654
For example,
there are people who write

00:19:44.654 --> 00:19:48.628
about American cities and say if
you have to choose between

00:19:48.628 --> 00:19:52.741
corruption and civil service
bureaucrats who do everything to

00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:57.519
the letter of the law,
take corruption.

00:19:57.519 --> 00:20:02.361
An example is--historical
example was the Fulton Fish

00:20:02.361 --> 00:20:06.923
Market in New York,
which was run by the mafia for

00:20:06.923 --> 00:20:11.019
a long time, and ran pretty
efficiently.

00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:17.230
There was some rent seeking and
some buyons but it worked,

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:21.652
and then Rudy Giuliani took it
over and put in clean

00:20:21.652 --> 00:20:26.053
bureaucrats to run it,
and people thought well it may

00:20:26.053 --> 00:20:28.660
not actually run as well this
way.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.890
Now but there is--there's
counterpoint to that.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.538
There's some big themes about
why corruption is,

00:20:34.538 --> 00:20:38.689
from the point of view of
growth and development and human

00:20:38.689 --> 00:20:41.439
welfare,
probably not on average a great

00:20:41.439 --> 00:20:41.880
thing.
 

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.608
Did you have a comment?
 

00:20:43.608 --> 00:20:46.280
Student:  Well yeah we
can almost go back to Adam Smith

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.112
in this regard,
but not what he's most famous

00:20:49.112 --> 00:20:52.476
for, but he's--
he kind of gives us self

00:20:52.476 --> 00:20:55.829
interest, but it's not this
naked,

00:20:55.829 --> 00:20:57.568
isolated form of self interest.
 

00:20:57.568 --> 00:21:01.383
He said capitalism only
functions upon a foundation of

00:21:01.383 --> 00:21:04.935
ethical participants,
and if not, it's brutally,

00:21:04.935 --> 00:21:09.292
grossly inefficient because you
can't get the right information

00:21:09.292 --> 00:21:11.049
around the right time.
 

00:21:11.049 --> 00:21:12.519
Prof: Terrific, right?
 

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:16.140
This is a huge point in
understanding Smith.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.047
Smith is a moralist,
Smith in his own time his

00:21:19.047 --> 00:21:22.406
famous book wasn't this it was
The Theory Of Moral

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:26.278
Sentiments,
and Smith is saying,

00:21:26.278 --> 00:21:32.598
"Articulate self interest
frankly pursued,

00:21:32.598 --> 00:21:38.690
within a framework of honest
communication,

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.094
and with a government in the
background that enforces

00:21:42.094 --> 00:21:46.799
contract and prohibits fraud,
within that framework self

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:51.618
interest creates an upward draft
on an economy.

00:21:51.618 --> 00:21:55.068
But if you take away that
framework,

00:21:55.068 --> 00:21:59.468
the ethical aspects of people's
beliefs and the proper

00:21:59.468 --> 00:22:04.614
functioning of the government in
enforcing contract and related

00:22:04.614 --> 00:22:08.708
things,
you take all that away,

00:22:08.708 --> 00:22:16.788
thus the invisible hand story
works if anything in reverse.

00:22:16.788 --> 00:22:25.902
We're inclined to just assume
that to just march too quickly

00:22:25.902 --> 00:22:32.390
by the issue of that
foundational issue.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.868
The--have I asked you this?
 

00:22:34.868 --> 00:22:40.640
How many of you have done Ben
Pollack's course on Game Theory?

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.875
That's really--I recommend it
to all of you,

00:22:45.875 --> 00:22:49.650
but think about this problem.
 

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:55.612
Suppose you are operating in a
system where everybody else is

00:22:55.612 --> 00:22:59.288
willing to lie in order to
profit,

00:22:59.288 --> 00:23:04.669
and each one of those other
people assume that about all the

00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:07.858
people she or he is dealing
with.

00:23:07.858 --> 00:23:13.358
How do you form a strategy to
make a business run?

00:23:13.358 --> 00:23:16.993
The answer is that it is
virtually impossible,

00:23:16.993 --> 00:23:21.355
because you cannot anticipate
the way people respond to

00:23:21.355 --> 00:23:23.858
straightforward incentives.
 

00:23:23.858 --> 00:23:30.190
It's a big deal and getting out
of that dilemma right--

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:35.954
another way to put it is
there's a famous philosophical

00:23:35.954 --> 00:23:39.425
example,
one version of which is a

00:23:39.425 --> 00:23:44.755
sentence written inside a box
which says this sentence is a

00:23:44.755 --> 00:23:49.365
lie,
or the sentence in this box is

00:23:49.365 --> 00:23:50.269
a lie.
 

00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:51.559
How do you interpret that?
 

00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:52.380
True or false?
 

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.797
False if true,
true if false,

00:23:54.797 --> 00:23:57.819
you can't get anywhere with
that;

00:23:57.819 --> 00:24:03.089
very hard to live that way.
 

00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:07.598
Vivek?
 

00:24:07.598 --> 00:24:12.859
Caste is a really complex
cultural structure which I've

00:24:12.859 --> 00:24:18.315
read a little about and talked
to Indians a little about,

00:24:18.315 --> 00:24:21.528
and it's obviously important.
 

00:24:21.528 --> 00:24:26.420
Help the uninitiated here a
little bit.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.220
Student:  Sure.
 

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.141
I did some research last night
but I think I got my most

00:24:31.141 --> 00:24:34.222
profound revelation when I
talked to one of my best friends

00:24:34.222 --> 00:24:35.019
from India.
 

00:24:35.019 --> 00:24:37.298
He gave me an incredible
perspective on caste and most

00:24:37.298 --> 00:24:39.019
people don't actually know about
that;

00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:42.204
I didn't know about it and I'm
going to go a little bit into

00:24:42.204 --> 00:24:44.796
the history of caste,
because it's--it's honestly

00:24:44.796 --> 00:24:45.660
fascinating.
 

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.798
Caste actually started out as a
really advanced complex system

00:24:49.798 --> 00:24:52.650
that we see in today's
capitalist world.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.779
It started as division of labor.
 

00:24:54.779 --> 00:24:57.368
It started off as promoting
specialization.

00:24:57.368 --> 00:25:01.308
Caste--a caste wasn't a bad
thing when it first started.

00:25:01.308 --> 00:25:04.098
It just means that people were
specialized in certain trades.

00:25:04.098 --> 00:25:06.957
For example,
we have blacksmiths and we had

00:25:06.957 --> 00:25:11.106
traders, and we had people on
different sectors of the economy

00:25:11.106 --> 00:25:11.720
here.
 

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.701
Similarly we had castes in
India, and they weren't,

00:25:15.701 --> 00:25:19.684
sadly, constraining,
they were just indicating what

00:25:19.684 --> 00:25:23.108
you are best at,
its division of labor.

00:25:23.108 --> 00:25:27.268
Caste actually started
degrading, unfortunately,

00:25:27.268 --> 00:25:31.778
and it's actually gone through
some de-evolution.

00:25:31.778 --> 00:25:33.279
This was catalyzed when the
British came.

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:37.170
When the British came they
didn't grasp caste as--

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.810
and the advanced system of
division of labor and

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:42.220
specialization,
they grasped caste as a more

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.972
feudal system,
and so they started

00:25:44.972 --> 00:25:48.463
perpetuating this thought that
once you're born in a caste

00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:51.560
you're stuck in a caste forever,
and that's what started

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.460
bringing the negative
connotations toward caste.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:26:00.838
That's what started making
caste constraining and that--

00:26:00.838 --> 00:26:03.298
I guess the best way to put
this is that the--

00:26:03.298 --> 00:26:05.849
after the British came,
it basically started destroying

00:26:05.849 --> 00:26:06.368
the cult.
 

00:26:06.368 --> 00:26:08.766
People started being born in
castes and they started

00:26:08.766 --> 00:26:11.348
think--believing they were
relegated to these castes.

00:26:11.348 --> 00:26:14.612
If you look at the book,
Balram ended a passage of the

00:26:14.612 --> 00:26:18.490
quote that there are only two
destinies: eat or get eaten up.

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:22.340
And that just shows the caste
evolved from being an advanced

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.990
concept of division of labor,
or specialization to something

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.500
that you're constrained too.
 

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.864
I think that today the only
thing that separates caste from

00:26:30.864 --> 00:26:33.588
an advanced capitalist structure
is mobility.

00:26:33.588 --> 00:26:35.286
In the caste,
there's not mobility because

00:26:35.286 --> 00:26:37.808
you're born into a system and
you're stuck with it forever.

00:26:37.808 --> 00:26:39.509
And in the American system for
example,

00:26:39.509 --> 00:26:41.950
you at least have the hope and
the ability to move from caste--

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.990
from trade to trade,
from caste to caste,

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.769
and I think that's a trend
that's going to be reversed.

00:26:46.769 --> 00:26:50.952
Prof: Well--and at the
foundation of India as a

00:26:50.952 --> 00:26:54.818
democracy in 1947 there was a
huge emphasis on the

00:26:54.818 --> 00:27:00.423
dalit, the untouchables,
and on making sure that they

00:27:00.423 --> 00:27:04.670
had opportunities similar to
other people.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.690
Anybody know anything about
that effort?

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.848
Yes.
 

00:27:10.848 --> 00:27:13.688
Student:  There--The
Mundill Commission started this

00:27:13.688 --> 00:27:16.102
program where--
kind of like affirmative action

00:27:16.102 --> 00:27:17.962
here,
but much more restrictive in

00:27:17.962 --> 00:27:20.220
the sense that they are
numerical quotas.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.760
So there are quotas for three
types of people:

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.550
OBC's,
other backward classes,

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.778
which is not necessarily as
much cast,

00:27:26.778 --> 00:27:29.180
or jati, but more
about economics.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.934
So a brahmin,
which is the highest caste can

00:27:30.934 --> 00:27:33.723
also be part of this caste--
I mean part of this relic

00:27:33.723 --> 00:27:35.946
designation,
if they do not earn as much as

00:27:35.946 --> 00:27:38.528
they are supposed to,
like ten rupees a month or

00:27:38.528 --> 00:27:39.779
something like that.
 

00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:41.779
Then you have Adivasis,
which is a scheduled tribe

00:27:41.779 --> 00:27:44.230
system, and then you also have a
scheduled caste system which

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.700
goes back to the original caste.
 

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.038
Now what's really interesting
about the caste system as--

00:27:48.038 --> 00:27:51.230
it was just mentioned that
there is no mobility,

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.653
but in essence,
there's still differences going

00:27:53.653 --> 00:27:56.398
on in India right now,
so people do move around--can

00:27:56.398 --> 00:27:57.038
move around.
 

00:27:57.038 --> 00:27:59.410
For example,
they can go in and out of the

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.548
OBC category,
so that still exists.

00:28:01.548 --> 00:28:05.700
Then these designations happen
in government positions,

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:09.368
so in IIT's which is--as you
know Hyundai was from IIT,

00:28:09.368 --> 00:28:11.957
and all these other
institutions that are government

00:28:11.957 --> 00:28:15.204
institutions like the proportion
of the population that is in any

00:28:15.204 --> 00:28:17.944
of these designations have to
have those seats in those

00:28:17.944 --> 00:28:18.910
institutions.
 

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:26.240
Prof: Good,
admirably done.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:33.102
Jasmine, I asked Jasmine to
think about the passage which

00:28:33.102 --> 00:28:40.700
begins with chopping onions
unusually early in the morning,

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.788
and then the discoveries which
followed that,

00:28:42.788 --> 00:28:46.269
and what it might tell us about
the role of religion.

00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:47.230
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:51.855
On page ninety in The White
Tiger it talks about like a

00:28:51.855 --> 00:28:57.219
discovery of Balram,
about the number one driver Ram

00:28:57.219 --> 00:29:00.888
Prasad,
and basically he just--he found

00:29:00.888 --> 00:29:06.297
out that Ram Persad was a Muslim
because he was observing Ramadan

00:29:06.297 --> 00:29:08.410
and he was not eating.
 

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:12.601
He was chopping up onions in
the dark because he has to fast

00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:15.750
during the day,
and so Balram was able to use

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.009
this fact as an advantage to
him,

00:29:18.009 --> 00:29:23.250
and basically because the
landlord is a Hindu and there is

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:28.952
kind of like a religious tension
between the Hindu majority and

00:29:28.952 --> 00:29:33.000
Muslim's in traditional parts of
India,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.874
so when he talked to another
servant about this and he was

00:29:38.874 --> 00:29:44.954
able to make his way to Delhi
because he was using this fact

00:29:44.954 --> 00:29:47.118
to his advantage.
 

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:50.248
Prof: Okay,
so historically this cleavage

00:29:50.248 --> 00:29:54.240
between Muslim and Hindu has
been a huge actor in the history

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.440
of South Asia?
 

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.140
Student:  Yes.
 

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:01.355
Basically I guess a lot of
Hindu's thought that Muslims was

00:30:01.355 --> 00:30:08.060
like an invader culture,
and also in like the 1947 when

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.568
they had--
well basically India was

00:30:11.568 --> 00:30:15.315
subdivided into Pakistan,
like the Muslim

00:30:15.315 --> 00:30:19.880
subcontinent--Muslim country and
the,

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.069
like, now modern India.
 

00:30:23.069 --> 00:30:25.288
Prof: Good.
 

00:30:25.288 --> 00:30:30.930
The other layer is captured in
the line in the book,

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:34.526
"there is no hatred like
that of the number two servant

00:30:34.526 --> 00:30:36.660
for the number one
servant."

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:42.315
That close conflict we
recognize--you see that

00:30:42.315 --> 00:30:49.480
everywhere around here,
you see it even on the faculty.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.529
Susie Park?
 

00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:54.858
That's the question.
 

00:30:54.858 --> 00:31:05.182
I was going to ask you about
servant hostility to servant and

00:31:05.182 --> 00:31:06.558
so on.
 

00:31:06.558 --> 00:31:11.123
Student:  Well I
guess--well basically it's kind

00:31:11.123 --> 00:31:15.009
of similar to servant hostility
to masters,

00:31:15.009 --> 00:31:17.160
I think, because,
like, when you look at,

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.220
like, the person to person,
like you're not actually hating

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.238
the person themselves,
but more like--because

00:31:24.238 --> 00:31:28.434
you're--like he has this,
kind of like,

00:31:28.434 --> 00:31:30.750
bitterness at the system
itself,

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:33.367
but then, like,
in some parts of the book it

00:31:33.367 --> 00:31:36.119
said they don't dare,
like, blame the bigger

00:31:36.119 --> 00:31:38.288
government, like the nation
itself,

00:31:38.288 --> 00:31:42.068
but they're more about like
blaming like the local like

00:31:42.068 --> 00:31:47.193
smaller like level,
and like the landlords--so it's

00:31:47.193 --> 00:31:52.458
kind of like they are--
like the White Tiger was more

00:31:52.458 --> 00:31:57.520
into like hitting the number one
driver rather than like the

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.980
system itself.
 

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:03.729
Prof: Right and so the
idea is the displacement of

00:32:03.729 --> 00:32:08.563
hostility to the huge system
onto the little system within

00:32:08.563 --> 00:32:10.088
the household.
 

00:32:10.088 --> 00:32:19.603
Nafez the--there's--I think one
of the great lines in the book

00:32:19.603 --> 00:32:26.400
is the one about the coop;
the chicken coop is guarded

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.569
from within.
 

00:32:27.569 --> 00:32:29.058
What's all that?
 

00:32:29.058 --> 00:32:31.329
Student:  I mean the way
I interpret it was it's more

00:32:31.329 --> 00:32:33.308
like a social construct,
where I mean if you just look

00:32:33.308 --> 00:32:35.923
at the back of the book it says,
Balram Halawi is a complicated

00:32:35.923 --> 00:32:37.236
man servant,
philosopher,

00:32:37.236 --> 00:32:39.306
entrepreneur,
etc., but when you're inside

00:32:39.306 --> 00:32:42.640
the coop you're only thinking of
how can I be a better servant.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.038
So it's a social construct
whereby,

00:32:44.038 --> 00:32:46.078
I mean, we can even relate it
to the hatred of servant one--

00:32:46.078 --> 00:32:48.930
servant two to servant one is
because the servant--

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:50.250
you're not thinking of becoming
a master,

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:53.048
what you're aspiring to is
servant one,

00:32:53.048 --> 00:32:56.134
and it just scares you to get
out of that social construct and

00:32:56.134 --> 00:32:59.321
the only way to get out of it is
to resolve to something extreme

00:32:59.321 --> 00:33:00.788
like killing your master.
 

00:33:00.788 --> 00:33:05.832
Prof: Okay so that often
the victims of a hugely

00:33:05.832 --> 00:33:11.435
oppressive situation are hostile
more to people who are their

00:33:11.435 --> 00:33:16.291
peers or near peers then to
people who are their vast

00:33:16.291 --> 00:33:20.451
superiors,
and that's a pretty good

00:33:20.451 --> 00:33:23.130
generalization actually.
 

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.230
Sebastian?
 

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:32.930
There we are.
 

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:36.509
Tell us about the car accident.
 

00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:40.660
Student:  All right,
so in page 137 there's a--

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:45.098
Pinky Madam decides that she
wants to drive,

00:33:45.098 --> 00:33:47.769
tells the driver to get out,
then she comes back,

00:33:47.769 --> 00:33:50.250
she's very drunk at this point,
comes back,

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:53.857
gets in--tells the driver to
get back in the car and then

00:33:53.857 --> 00:33:55.920
drives off and hits something.
 

00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:00.701
At first we don't know what it
is, we quickly discover it's a

00:34:00.701 --> 00:34:05.145
child,
and everyone's kind of in shock

00:34:05.145 --> 00:34:07.759
and I think--
I don't know if you want me to

00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:09.059
say more of the details of the
accident,

00:34:09.059 --> 00:34:13.550
but the biggest implication is
that then Balram is asked to

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.340
take the blame for this
accident,

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:22.190
this master's wife committed.
 

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:26.619
Instead of thinking of how he
cannot take the blame,

00:34:26.619 --> 00:34:29.161
he kind of starts automatically
assuming how am I going to

00:34:29.161 --> 00:34:31.550
survive in jail,
what am I going to do to

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.130
survive?
 

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:35.704
I think it goes back to that
thing that we were just talking

00:34:35.704 --> 00:34:38.735
about on the rooster coop,
where it's just absolute

00:34:38.735 --> 00:34:42.115
perpetual servitude;
it's kind of very much

00:34:42.115 --> 00:34:43.079
intrinsic.
 

00:34:43.079 --> 00:34:44.800
Prof: Okay, good.
 

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.724
Now--and what this is
straightforward-

00:34:47.724 --> 00:34:50.809
-straightforward criminal
corruption.

00:34:50.809 --> 00:35:02.304
It's a criminal act that the
Kosh couple are committing and

00:35:02.304 --> 00:35:11.619
The White Tiger basically just
lives with it.

00:35:11.619 --> 00:35:18.090
Later in the book--Ann where
are you?

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:25.367
Later in the book the concept
of rage gets to be center stage,

00:35:25.367 --> 00:35:29.842
I think on page 196 is it;
help us with that,

00:35:29.842 --> 00:35:31.539
what's going on with that?
 

00:35:31.539 --> 00:35:35.240
Student:  Well I think
to a certain extent he realizes

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.818
that the only way for him to
escape kind of from the rooter

00:35:38.818 --> 00:35:41.039
coop is to do something extreme.
 

00:35:41.039 --> 00:35:44.362
One thing that he talks about
when he describes the whole

00:35:44.362 --> 00:35:47.864
rooster coop analogy is that
like he mentions family as part

00:35:47.864 --> 00:35:49.289
of that explanation.
 

00:35:49.289 --> 00:35:52.849
He says that family is like the
thing--

00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:56.650
that family is the thing that
keeps you in the coop and so I

00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:00.389
think like he needs a really
powerful emotion to counteract

00:36:00.389 --> 00:36:03.159
the family ties in order to
break free.

00:36:03.159 --> 00:36:08.266
Prof: Okay,
so he's in two different

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:13.981
coercive networks,
one to do with his own family

00:36:13.981 --> 00:36:20.789
and another to do with the
family which employs him.

00:36:20.789 --> 00:36:23.590
Jake are you here?
 

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:29.603
The most dramatic passage in
the book has to do with the

00:36:29.603 --> 00:36:33.539
ulterior uses of a whiskey
bottle.

00:36:33.539 --> 00:36:35.730
Student:  Right.
 

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:43.210
Balram uses the bottle to kill
the son of his employer,

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:46.956
and he does this to steal the
money that Ashok was going to

00:36:46.956 --> 00:36:49.670
use to bribe officials and he's
go off,

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:51.829
takes it, and starts his own
life.

00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:54.806
Prof: Okay,
how do you interpret what he

00:36:54.806 --> 00:36:55.260
does?
 

00:36:55.260 --> 00:37:01.159
Student:  I saw it sort
of emblematic of the new India,

00:37:01.159 --> 00:37:08.570
sort of taking over and sort of
replacing the old India,

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:12.030
that Ashok and his family are
sort of representative of

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.530
because he's the son of a
landowner,

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.262
he's wealthy,
and he's using his money to try

00:37:17.262 --> 00:37:20.679
to keep himself in power by
bribing these officials,

00:37:20.679 --> 00:37:24.128
and Ashok takes that money--or
Balram takes the money and he

00:37:24.128 --> 00:37:27.460
goes and uses it to sort of
start his own business and get

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.980
himself up to the top.
 

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.510
Prof: As he says an act
of entrepreneurship.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.789
Student:  Right.
 

00:37:33.789 --> 00:37:42.880
Prof: There was a huge
amount of parody in this.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.659
Do you think--how do you judge
him for this?

00:37:45.659 --> 00:37:50.661
Student:  I mean I would
say that it was--I wouldn't

00:37:50.661 --> 00:37:54.630
condone it, but I can sort of
understand it.

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:58.911
Prof: Would you go so
far as to say justifiable

00:37:58.911 --> 00:37:59.800
homicide?
 

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.530
Student:  Not
justifiable in the sense that

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.523
he--
the man that he murdered

00:38:06.523 --> 00:38:09.327
deserved it,
but for him it was the only way

00:38:09.327 --> 00:38:12.840
to break out of the life that he
had been living and--

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.992
to me it just sort of--it
really captured just how

00:38:16.992 --> 00:38:21.652
traumatic for a society--
a change like modernization can

00:38:21.652 --> 00:38:21.960
be.
 

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.889
Everyone's scrambling to get
themselves ahead and in the

00:38:25.889 --> 00:38:28.889
process people get stepped on,
people--

00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:31.889
Prof: Okay so you see it
as a rational act?

00:38:31.889 --> 00:38:32.159
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:38:32.159 --> 00:38:33.840
Prof: Not an act of rage?
 

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.231
Student:  Yeah I think
it was definitely a rational

00:38:37.231 --> 00:38:39.909
act, but I don't know if that
justifies it.

00:38:39.909 --> 00:38:43.300
Prof: Okay well I don't
think it justifies it.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:49.389
I'm not much on justifiable
homicide as a cultural trope,

00:38:49.389 --> 00:38:54.719
but it makes it easy to
understand, doesn't it?

00:38:54.719 --> 00:38:59.210
Amy Chu in the law school has a
book about--

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:02.980
it begins with a story from her
own family in the Philippines,

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:10.018
and in it her grandmother is
murdered by the family chauffer.

00:39:10.018 --> 00:39:21.666
The police record where motive
is recorded as just one word:

00:39:21.666 --> 00:39:23.639
revenge.
 

00:39:23.639 --> 00:39:30.054
And the relationship between
people who are completely

00:39:30.054 --> 00:39:34.289
dependent servants of
arbitrary--

00:39:34.289 --> 00:39:39.500
families who behave arbitrarily
and cruelly,

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:43.204
this is an ancient story,
and it's one that's easy to

00:39:43.204 --> 00:39:44.130
understand.
 

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:50.110
Now let's get back to bigger
picture.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.199
Why is Balram so weak?
 

00:39:53.199 --> 00:39:57.300
Well there's--I had another--I
asked somebody about English

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.139
language, who did I ask?
 

00:39:59.139 --> 00:40:01.429
Okay then I'll ask myself.
 

00:40:01.429 --> 00:40:06.483
English plays a huge part in
the class structure of a society

00:40:06.483 --> 00:40:07.579
like India.
 

00:40:07.579 --> 00:40:16.130
The--let's just list Balram's
weaknesses economically.

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:23.248
One is English is not his first
language, his family and the

00:40:23.248 --> 00:40:26.869
debt to The Stork,
was it--

00:40:26.869 --> 00:40:29.514
Student:  And the debt
was the brother and sister

00:40:29.514 --> 00:40:29.900
dowry.
 

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:30.670
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:35.253
The debt which gets him jerked
out of school and which is a

00:40:35.253 --> 00:40:39.760
constant burden to the family,
that's another weakness.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.858
He drops out of school because
his uncle rips him out of school

00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:45.380
actually, forcefully.
 

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.210
Other weaknesses?
 

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:51.130
Caste, he is not from an
advantaged caste.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:55.938
Sweet makers,
I don't quite understand why

00:40:55.938 --> 00:41:02.269
that disadvantage but--what
about the world demographic

00:41:02.269 --> 00:41:04.030
transition?
 

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:07.574
The world demographic
transition bearing down on this

00:41:07.574 --> 00:41:08.869
young man at all?
 

00:41:08.869 --> 00:41:15.556
Yes because the huge surge of
population in the darkness of

00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:22.242
India creates a devastatingly
plentiful supply of unskilled

00:41:22.242 --> 00:41:28.467
labor so that the market
equilibrium price of unskilled

00:41:28.467 --> 00:41:32.949
labor is very,
very low.

00:41:32.949 --> 00:41:38.525
The standards you have to use
in treating employees in

00:41:38.525 --> 00:41:44.835
unskilled or semi-skilled jobs
in order to keep them with you

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:46.730
are near zero.
 

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:50.672
Rickshaw puller,
rickshaw pullers have

00:41:50.672 --> 00:41:56.960
essentially no market power and
it has everything to do with

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.559
demography.
 

00:41:58.559 --> 00:42:01.469
It also, of course,
has to do with educational

00:42:01.469 --> 00:42:05.534
opportunity,
command of the lingua of the

00:42:05.534 --> 00:42:08.512
country,
all those things,

00:42:08.512 --> 00:42:14.905
but when we talk about the
demographic transition it's this

00:42:14.905 --> 00:42:21.516
ultimately benign story about
going from short lives and many

00:42:21.516 --> 00:42:25.003
babies,
to long lives and fewer babies

00:42:25.003 --> 00:42:26.579
over a period of time.
 

00:42:26.579 --> 00:42:30.992
But there's a huge coercive
aspect to the way it works out

00:42:30.992 --> 00:42:36.179
during the transition for people
who don't have demographic luck.

00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:43.052
Luck of a--luck--big time luck,
historical luck is a pretty big

00:42:43.052 --> 00:42:43.940
thing.
 

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:51.286
I'll give you another example,
New Haven had very few black

00:42:51.286 --> 00:42:57.818
citizens before World War II,
and at the time that World War

00:42:57.818 --> 00:43:02.695
II, when southern agriculture
was pushing labor off the land

00:43:02.695 --> 00:43:07.820
most of the black families who
ever came to New Haven came here

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:14.143
in about a fifteen-year period,
and they came in search of

00:43:14.143 --> 00:43:17.030
industrial employment.
 

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:22.016
Exactly a decade before that
industrial employment collapsed,

00:43:22.016 --> 00:43:23.929
and went guess where?
 

00:43:23.929 --> 00:43:25.659
South.
 

00:43:25.659 --> 00:43:30.590
The industrial employment went
south seeking lower energy costs

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:33.929
and cheaper labor so that the
economic--

00:43:33.929 --> 00:43:36.409
it's of course a much more
complex story,

00:43:36.409 --> 00:43:38.500
but the timing couldn't have
been worse,

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.315
and Balram's timing in
demographic history couldn't

00:43:42.315 --> 00:43:44.070
have been much worse.
 

00:43:44.070 --> 00:47:16.679
Now Wednesday's case about
Selco [Video 43:53-47:15].

00:47:16.679 --> 00:47:19.070
A couple of announcements in
closing.

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:22.300
The case is in two parts,
A and B;

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.739
both are posted on classes V2
for Wednesday's class.

00:47:25.739 --> 00:47:29.809
On Monday I will be here only
by video.

00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:36.166
I'm in Washington Monday and
I'm going to speak the lecture

00:47:36.166 --> 00:47:40.880
to a lens and play it in my own
absence,

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:45.793
but otherwise everything will
be normal and the exams will

00:47:45.793 --> 00:47:47.949
come back on Wednesday.
 

00:47:47.949 --> 00:47:53.429
My impression is that the
grades are outrageously high.

00:47:53.429 --> 00:47:59.000

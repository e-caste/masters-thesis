00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.316
Professor Mark Saltzman:
So, what I'm going to talk

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:20.070
about today and Thursday is two
topics,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.692
which what I hope to do is sort
of bring together some of the

00:00:22.692 --> 00:00:25.271
information that we've been
talking about over the course of

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:28.490
the term.
To do that, I want to focus on

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.818
two areas, today talk about
cancer--a big subject,

00:00:32.818 --> 00:00:36.440
and so we'll just scratch the
surface.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.708
The main point that I want to
make is how some of the

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:43.480
technologies that we've been
talking about over the course of

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.440
the term are having an impact on
cancer diagnosis and care,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.826
and to sort of point to some
areas where they'll likely be

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:54.450
more progress and opportunities
for progress in the future.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.054
Then, on Thursday,
we'll do the same thing but

00:00:57.054 --> 00:00:59.890
talking about the subject of
artificial organs.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.559
One that we've brushed on a
couple of times through the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.315
semester, but just try to spend
some focus time on it on

00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:12.570
Thursday.
Section meeting on Thursday

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.489
afternoon, we'll do a course
review.

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:19.590
I'll be there for each of the
sections.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.262
I'll just be leading a
discussion about what we've

00:01:23.262 --> 00:01:27.760
covered in the course and what
kinds of things will be on the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.470
final.
Any questions?

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.053
You know what's described
here on this slide,

00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:40.310
that cancer is a deadly and,
unfortunately,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.564
not uncommon disease.
These are some statistics from

00:01:44.564 --> 00:01:48.190
2006 collected by The American
Cancer Society.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.992
One of the things that we do
fairly well as a nation,

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:57.610
now, is keep track of cancer
cases and progress.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.154
This has been an important part
of our learning about where

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.721
cancers occur,
what are the causes and what

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:07.752
treatments work and what don't.
The American Cancer Society has

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:11.476
been a big part of that effort
to collect information on where

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:14.503
cancers occur in the country,
in what people,

00:02:14.503 --> 00:02:18.083
in what age groups,
and to provide that information

00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:21.949
for people that are working on
research for cancer.

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.270
This just summarizes some
of that information.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.038
For 2006, new cases of cancer
you can see over a million new

00:02:30.038 --> 00:02:36.197
cases, deaths from cancer about
half a million and roughly equal

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:41.681
between males and females.
Here's some common types of

00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:47.255
cancer occurring in females,
breast cancer in both males and

00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:51.696
females, lung cancer,
and in males only prostate

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:55.280
cancer.
The statistics are alarming.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.267
You look at the number of
deaths that are caused by cancer

00:02:58.267 --> 00:03:00.939
and if you want to learn more
about sort of that,

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.313
I urge you to go to The
American Cancer Society website

00:03:04.313 --> 00:03:07.500
which is listed here.
Just a few facts about

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.865
cancer that you probably know
something about this,

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:14.500
it's now the most common cause
of death in the U.S.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.310
and that's true in many
developed countries.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.977
Cancer and heart disease have
been neck and neck in terms of

00:03:20.977 --> 00:03:24.769
the number one cause of deaths
in developed countries for many

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.938
years now.
It looks like cancer is winning

00:03:27.938 --> 00:03:30.830
and we'll talk about that in a
minute.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.759
Cancer's caused by mutations in
genes that control cell growth.

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:39.698
You know that a cancer or
formation of a tumor is an

00:03:39.698 --> 00:03:43.020
unwanted or uncontrolled growth
of cells.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.530
Cell division runs amuck and
cells don't stop dividing under

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.030
circumstances where they're
supposed to.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.381
So, you get--a mass is formed
and that mass is--it represents

00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:57.780
the unwanted growth of cells.
The mutations that cause

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.390
cancer, that cause these defects
in cell growth,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.770
can be either inherited or
environmental.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.504
We know that there are thing in
the environment that cause

00:04:08.504 --> 00:04:11.189
cancer, some viruses can cause
cancers.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:15.764
One of the clearest links is
between human papillomavirus,

00:04:15.764 --> 00:04:20.740
a sexually transmitted disease
and cervical cancer in women.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.738
There is a new vaccine for HPV,
human papillomavirus and it's

00:04:25.738 --> 00:04:31.070
expected that this vaccine which
will prevent spread of the virus

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.069
will also significantly reduce
cancer cases.

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:39.382
Other kinds of viruses are
linked to liver cancers,

00:04:39.382 --> 00:04:41.595
for example.
Chemicals can also,

00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:43.765
in the environment,
can also cause cancer,

00:04:43.765 --> 00:04:46.199
and we'll talk more about that
in a minute.

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:52.385
Most cancers also involve some
genetic changes that can be

00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:58.631
either acquired or inherited.
You know also that cancer can

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:02.228
run in families.
The risk of certain kinds of

00:05:02.228 --> 00:05:05.160
cancers, there's a genetic basis
for that.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.168
In the U.S.,
the lifetime risk of cancer is

00:05:08.168 --> 00:05:11.490
1 in 2 for men.
So, half of men will have some

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.290
kind of cancer,
and 1 in 3 for women.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.079
That's a pretty impressive
number.

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:22.305
The age adjusted mortality rate
for cancer is about the same in

00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:24.490
the 21st century as it was 50
years ago,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.545
that is, the rate of death from
cancer hasn't changed very much

00:05:28.545 --> 00:05:31.786
in the last 50 years.
This, in spite of the fact that

00:05:31.786 --> 00:05:35.033
there's been a lot of attention
to cancer and learning more

00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:36.767
about cancer,
and its causes,

00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:39.892
the basic biology and in trying
to design new methods for

00:05:39.892 --> 00:05:43.292
diagnosing and treating cancer.
But overall deaths haven't

00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:46.213
changed very much;
we've made progress in certain

00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:48.339
kinds of tumors but not in
others.

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:51.935
This just, I think,
reflects the fact that both

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.750
cancer is a heterogeneous
disease.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.766
You know that it occurs in a
variety of sites throughout the

00:05:57.766 --> 00:06:01.139
body, but in each of those sites
cancers can be quite different.

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.100
It's not one disease but its
family of diseases.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.879
Because of that,
it's been hard to make progress

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:12.301
in treatment because all of them
have slightly different

00:06:12.301 --> 00:06:15.578
characteristics.
This just illustrates that

00:06:15.578 --> 00:06:17.470
last point a little more
clearly.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.492
Change in U.S.
death rates by cause from 1950

00:06:20.492 --> 00:06:24.712
to 2003, so over that period
deaths from heart disease went

00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:28.224
down dramatically.
Deaths from cerebral vascular

00:06:28.224 --> 00:06:32.193
diseases, so deaths of the
circulatory system in the brain,

00:06:32.193 --> 00:06:36.300
so this is mainly stroke and
aneurisms down dramatically.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.291
Deaths from infectious
diseases, we talked about

00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:43.174
vaccines several weeks ago which
has a big impact on mortality

00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:47.110
from infectious diseases,
also down over that years.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.389
Deaths from cancer stay about
the same.

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:55.241
While we've made great
progress, we're not yet at the

00:06:55.241 --> 00:07:00.373
point where we're changing the
outcomes from cancer very

00:07:00.373 --> 00:07:03.535
dramatically.
I mentioned a few minutes

00:07:03.535 --> 00:07:06.089
ago that exposure to chemicals
can cause cancer,

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:09.056
and you know this.
One of the most well known

00:07:09.056 --> 00:07:13.199
exposures that's clearly a cause
of cancer is tobacco use.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.253
This is tobacco use mainly
thinking about cigarette

00:07:17.253 --> 00:07:21.712
smoking, but the same thing
could be true of any kind of

00:07:21.712 --> 00:07:25.155
tobacco use.
Smoking in other--cigars or

00:07:25.155 --> 00:07:29.765
chewing tobacco also causes
cancer because the chemicals in

00:07:29.765 --> 00:07:33.579
cigarette smoke or in tobacco,
in particular.

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:38.433
Some of the tars that are
associated with smoking cause

00:07:38.433 --> 00:07:41.579
cancer of the lung in
particular.

00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:45.620
This was first noticed by
looking at epidemiological data.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.074
We talked about public health
and epidemiology a few weeks ago

00:07:49.074 --> 00:07:52.415
where you look at how diseases
appear in populations and you

00:07:52.415 --> 00:07:55.019
try to figure out why things are
changing.

00:07:55.019 --> 00:08:00.283
Here's as cigarettes were
consumed more in the U.S.,

00:08:00.283 --> 00:08:05.857
you can see the trend in
cigarette consumption going up

00:08:05.857 --> 00:08:11.629
over time from 1900 to 1950.
Then, lagging behind that by

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:16.657
about a period of 30 years,
is a dramatic increase in lung

00:08:16.657 --> 00:08:19.282
cancer.
First among men and then among

00:08:19.282 --> 00:08:22.882
women, and the reason for that
is because cigarette smoking was

00:08:22.882 --> 00:08:25.959
initially more popular among men
than among women,

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:30.310
but advertising and the women's
movement changed that.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.651
Cigarette smoking became
something that everybody could

00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:35.614
do.
It was acceptable in polite

00:08:35.614 --> 00:08:38.837
society for women to smoke,
and they were targeted by

00:08:38.837 --> 00:08:42.553
manufacturers of cigarettes.
Special cigarettes were made

00:08:42.553 --> 00:08:46.011
for women, they're special in
some way but not in their

00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:49.458
ability to cause cancer,
they're all the same and so

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:53.720
female lung cancer still rising.
You can see we've made progress

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.135
in male lung cancer,
mainly by reducing the number

00:08:57.135 --> 00:09:00.830
of smokers, but that hasn't yet
happened in women.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.338
Evidence first came from
epidemiology but then after it

00:09:04.338 --> 00:09:08.235
was realized that there was an
association between cigarettes

00:09:08.235 --> 00:09:11.049
smoking and cancer.
Then, you can start to look

00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:14.030
more closely and try to figure
out what the molecular cause of

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.995
it is.
We now know quite a lot

00:09:15.995 --> 00:09:19.498
about how the chemicals in smoke
cause these sorts of malignant

00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:22.210
transformations in cells that
lead to cancer.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:27.205
The evidence is pretty clear.
The main point that exposure to

00:09:27.205 --> 00:09:31.446
chemicals can cause cancer.
This just to try to put in

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:35.675
perspective where cancer occurs,
what are the most frequent

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:38.519
causes of cancer that lead to
death,

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:42.590
and in both men and women,
lunch cancer is number one.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.092
After that it changes the top
three in men being lung,

00:09:46.092 --> 00:09:48.491
colon and prostate;
in women lung,

00:09:48.491 --> 00:09:52.536
breast and colon and accounting
for just those top three,

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:56.832
the large majority of cancers.
Cancer of the pancreas is much

00:09:56.832 --> 00:10:00.658
less common but because it's so
difficult to detect and we'll

00:10:00.658 --> 00:10:05.012
talk about methods of detection.
The pancreas is an organ that's

00:10:05.012 --> 00:10:08.984
deep within your body and it's
hard to find when things are

00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:12.301
going wrong with it.
Because it's difficult to

00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:16.830
detect cancer of the pancreas it
very frequently leads to death,

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.612
and of course this is in the
news now because this is the

00:10:19.612 --> 00:10:21.649
kind of cancer that Patrick
Swayze has.

00:10:21.649 --> 00:10:25.565
Life expectancy when you have
pancreatic cancer is--life

00:10:25.565 --> 00:10:29.623
expectancy is very low because
it's usually in an advanced

00:10:29.623 --> 00:10:33.969
stage when it's discovered.
Cancer cells are different,

00:10:33.969 --> 00:10:38.109
so what makes all these cancers
at different sites similar is

00:10:38.109 --> 00:10:42.179
the similar characteristics that
the cells that form cancers

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:44.954
have.
I mentioned already that one of

00:10:44.954 --> 00:10:48.718
the things that characterizes
cancer is that cells divide

00:10:48.718 --> 00:10:50.311
abnormally.
They divide,

00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:52.494
usually, more rapidly.
We talked about,

00:10:52.494 --> 00:10:55.821
several weeks ago when we were
talking about cell culture,

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:59.265
we talked about cells that you
would isolate from tissue and

00:10:59.265 --> 00:11:02.651
they would grow at a rate of
about by doubling their number

00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:05.570
everyday if you maintained them
in culture.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.852
Cancer cells can grow much
faster than that so they have

00:11:09.852 --> 00:11:12.889
mechanisms for dividing very
rapidly.

00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:16.640
More importantly probably,
they don't stop proliferating

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.950
when they're supposed too.
You know, from what we've

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.950
talked about before,
that there are cells that are

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.440
continually dividing and
reproducing within your body.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.972
Cells in you intestinal tract
for example, cells in the liver,

00:11:29.972 --> 00:11:33.620
cells in the kidney continually
dividing, cells in your skin.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.866
But ordinarily your skin stays
the same size that it is because

00:11:36.866 --> 00:11:39.590
are cells are dividing but they
know when to stop.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.816
They stop when they reach the
right density,

00:11:41.816 --> 00:11:43.836
the right shape,
they know where they're

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:45.892
supposed to be.
Cancer cells don't,

00:11:45.892 --> 00:11:48.941
they continue to divide even
when they get signals that

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:51.029
they're supposed to stop
dividing.

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:56.861
Because of this tumors form,
abnormal growths--the organ

00:11:56.861 --> 00:12:02.480
of--origin becomes larger than
it ordinarily would.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.569
They generally don't
respond to signals that are

00:12:04.569 --> 00:12:06.994
provided by neighboring cells,
we talked about cell

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:10.172
communication and how important
that was for the life of a

00:12:10.172 --> 00:12:12.225
tissue.
For your liver to be your liver

00:12:12.225 --> 00:12:15.071
and your brain to your brain,
they don't just have the right

00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:17.966
cells there but they have cells
that are communicating in the

00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:20.607
right way.
There's a loss of that normal

00:12:20.607 --> 00:12:23.649
molecular communication when you
have cancer.

00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:26.607
They don't differentiate
normally but tend to remain as

00:12:26.607 --> 00:12:29.620
immature de-differentiated or
undifferentiated cells.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.445
What's this like?
This is like we talked about

00:12:33.445 --> 00:12:38.891
stem cells, stem cells are less
mature than differentiated

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:41.470
tissue cells.
They grow rapidly;

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.940
both stem cells which
self-renew and cancer cells.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.254
They don't form mature types of
cells and there's a lot of

00:12:50.254 --> 00:12:54.190
linkages know known between stem
cells and cancer.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.131
Some people think that within
any individual tumor,

00:12:58.131 --> 00:13:02.152
there are cancer stem cells
that really are the most

00:13:02.152 --> 00:13:06.460
important ones to treat.
If you get rid of even the bulk

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.390
of cancer cells without getting
rid of these very stem like

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.710
cells in cancers the tumors will
regrow again.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.651
So, normal differentiation
like stem cells is a problem

00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:20.227
with cancer cells.
They don't adhere readily to

00:13:20.227 --> 00:13:22.619
other cells and extracellular
matrix, they do not become

00:13:22.619 --> 00:13:25.958
specialized and die.
Because cells in your skin are

00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:30.557
continually going through not
just birth, not just growth of

00:13:30.557 --> 00:13:33.977
new cells but death.
There's skin cells that are

00:13:33.977 --> 00:13:36.990
dying and being shed from your
body all the time.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:42.330
Cancer cells don't undergo
those normal processes of cell

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:47.289
death that lead to regulation of
tissue structure.

00:13:47.289 --> 00:13:50.884
If a cancer forms,
it tends to go through

00:13:50.884 --> 00:13:54.806
different stages and that this
cell, for example,

00:13:54.806 --> 00:13:58.320
in this tissue is a
pre-malignant cell.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.161
If it becomes malignant,
it will start dividing and

00:14:01.161 --> 00:14:04.059
growing out of control and you
can see that here.

00:14:04.059 --> 00:14:08.075
That tumor that forms at the
initial site or the site of the

00:14:08.075 --> 00:14:11.409
origin of a cancer is called the
primary tumor.

00:14:11.409 --> 00:14:13.693
These tumors,
if they grew,

00:14:13.693 --> 00:14:18.522
would ordinarily stop at a size
of about one millimeter,

00:14:18.522 --> 00:14:21.197
very small.
You wouldn't even be able to

00:14:21.197 --> 00:14:23.621
notice them, maybe,
if they're only a millimeter or

00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:26.330
so in size.
They don't grow beyond that as

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.308
a cell mass because they can't
get nutrients,

00:14:29.308 --> 00:14:32.489
oxygen, glucose,
the things that the cell needs,

00:14:32.489 --> 00:14:35.292
amino acids.
The things that it needs in

00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:38.277
order to produce new cells can't
get in because those are

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:40.409
normally provided by the
bloodstream.

00:14:40.409 --> 00:14:44.950
When the cell is just dividing
out of control there's no blood

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.474
supply.
Many people think that tumor

00:14:49.474 --> 00:14:54.268
size would be limited.
Cancer wouldn't be such a

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:57.980
problem, except for the fact
that cancers at this stage,

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.117
as they move from this primary
stage to invasive cancer,

00:15:01.117 --> 00:15:04.254
they develop an ability to
stimulate the growth of blood

00:15:04.254 --> 00:15:06.692
vessels So,
now you can see blood vessels

00:15:06.692 --> 00:15:09.858
are growing into and through
this tumor, they develop their

00:15:09.858 --> 00:15:12.802
own blood supply.
They're able to get nutrients

00:15:12.802 --> 00:15:16.314
readily, and this is when the
growth of the tumor really

00:15:16.314 --> 00:15:19.386
starts to take off.
We'll talk about some therapies

00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:22.019
that block this process of new
tumor growth called

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:25.402
angiogenesis.
Many people think if you could

00:15:25.402 --> 00:15:30.364
block that process selectively
in tumors then you could halt

00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:35.830
all tumors to a very small size
that would not cause problems.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.244
An additional stage after
angiogenesis that some tumors

00:15:39.244 --> 00:15:42.070
can go through is a process
called metastasis.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.732
That's where tumor cells
actually leave their site of

00:15:44.732 --> 00:15:47.190
origin and travel to other
places in the body.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.659
That's shown schematically in
this cartoon here.

00:15:49.659 --> 00:15:53.561
A tumor cell entering the
circulation, it can flow through

00:15:53.561 --> 00:15:56.572
the circulation,
and maybe get lodged at some

00:15:56.572 --> 00:16:00.337
distant site and begin the
process of tumor formation at

00:16:00.337 --> 00:16:03.903
that distant site.
This is obviously a bad thing

00:16:03.903 --> 00:16:07.883
because maybe you can treat the
primary tumor in a variety of

00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:11.730
different ways which we'll talk
about in just a minute.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:15.124
Once it begins to spread
throughout the body becomes much

00:16:15.124 --> 00:16:18.249
more difficult to treat.
You have not just one tumor,

00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:21.294
but potentially hundreds or
thousands of tumors that are

00:16:21.294 --> 00:16:23.010
forming throughout the body.

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:30.137
The treatment for
tumors--for cancer--depends very

00:16:30.137 --> 00:16:33.549
much on what stage it's at when
it's identified.

00:16:33.549 --> 00:16:36.919
For every kind of cancer
physicians, oncologists,

00:16:36.919 --> 00:16:40.990
have developed classification
methods for talking about,

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.111
to each other,
about what stage the cancer is

00:16:45.111 --> 00:16:47.614
at.
I'll just show you that in an

00:16:47.614 --> 00:16:50.070
example of that in bladder
cancer.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:55.840
You might have an initial stage
here which is called TA.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.000
T is the tumor rating,
T for tumor.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.445
This is a very small tumor
that's just confined to the

00:17:02.445 --> 00:17:04.470
lining.
When it gets larger it's

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:07.477
classified as T1.
When it gets up to stage T2

00:17:07.477 --> 00:17:11.904
it's starting to invade from the
lining of the bladder into the

00:17:11.904 --> 00:17:14.759
other tissues of the bladder,
T3, T4.

00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:19.403
By the time it's got to stage
T4, it's occupying not only the

00:17:19.403 --> 00:17:24.123
whole thickness of the wall of
the bladder but it's started to

00:17:24.123 --> 00:17:28.069
invade other tissues like the
prostate as well.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:31.783
You can see that if you
have a tumor that's at one of

00:17:31.783 --> 00:17:34.900
these early stages,
local therapy might work;

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.023
surgery or radiation,
or local chemotherapy which

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:41.623
we'll talk about.
As it begins to invade other

00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:45.759
organs, then it becomes more
difficult to treat.

00:17:45.759 --> 00:17:48.263
They can spread and I don't
mean for you to--tumors can

00:17:48.263 --> 00:17:51.185
spread, and I don't mean for you
to be able to see all this here

00:17:51.185 --> 00:17:55.230
but you can look at this,
these slides will be posted as

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.905
usual.
Not only can you classify the

00:17:57.905 --> 00:18:02.419
normal--the original site of the
tumor and that's classifications

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:06.440
of melanoma from T1 up to T4 and
they're defined here,

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.122
but you can classify whether it
has spread locally to lymph

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:12.574
nodes.
That's these end stages here,

00:18:12.574 --> 00:18:16.059
and whether it has metastasized
to different sites.

00:18:16.059 --> 00:18:20.079
Ordinarily, a physician will
classify a tumor according to

00:18:20.079 --> 00:18:24.239
the tumor nodal involvement
metastasis classification that's

00:18:24.239 --> 00:18:26.990
appropriate for that kind of
tumor.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:32.186
This allows physicians to
say exactly where your cancer is

00:18:32.186 --> 00:18:35.750
at in development.
We know, because we've been

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:40.022
treating cancer for a long time
now, you can select a treatment

00:18:40.022 --> 00:18:43.950
that's most likely to work for
the stage that it's at.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.942
This, all to say that
diagnosing specifically where a

00:18:47.942 --> 00:18:52.164
cancer is at in its development
within a patient is very

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:57.077
important for deciding what kind
of a treatment is likely to lead

00:18:57.077 --> 00:19:00.266
to a good outcome.
One of the things that

00:19:00.266 --> 00:19:04.183
biomedical engineers have worked
very diligently on over the last

00:19:04.183 --> 00:19:08.099
50 years or so is designing new
methods for cancer diagnosis.

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:10.390
We've talked about some of
these as we've gone through the

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.319
course and I just want to
highlight them here.

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:16.541
We talked about X-rays and
using X-ray radiation to look

00:19:16.541 --> 00:19:20.051
inside the body.
Mammography is a special kind

00:19:20.051 --> 00:19:24.802
of X-ray imaging that's used to
look just at the breasts to see

00:19:24.802 --> 00:19:28.710
if there are abnormal tissues
within the breast.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:33.383
This shows a normal mammogram
and this shows a mammogram with

00:19:33.383 --> 00:19:37.589
some kind of a dense deposit
here that's not normal.

00:19:37.589 --> 00:19:42.157
Mammography is used to screen
for breast cancer and it's a

00:19:42.157 --> 00:19:46.135
very important screen.
Now women, when they reach a

00:19:46.135 --> 00:19:50.321
certain age, are recommended to
have mammography a certain

00:19:50.321 --> 00:19:54.653
number of times per year or per
decade just to try to detect

00:19:54.653 --> 00:19:58.125
cancers at an early stage.
This is an example of

00:19:58.125 --> 00:20:00.289
biomedical engineering for
diagnosis.

00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:04.555
Pap smears also done during
routine pelvic exams in women,

00:20:04.555 --> 00:20:08.610
where a swab is used to remove
some cells from the cervical

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.642
region.
Then you can look at these

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:13.557
cells under the microscope and
here's what a normal Pap smear

00:20:13.557 --> 00:20:17.080
would look like.
You can see the cells are flat,

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.611
they have small nuclei,
not a lot of protein and so the

00:20:21.611 --> 00:20:25.330
cells don't stain very darkly.
Malignant cells,

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.239
on the other hand,
cells that indicate there might

00:20:28.239 --> 00:20:31.743
be cancer present have larger
nuclei, more intense staining,

00:20:31.743 --> 00:20:34.999
abnormal shapes.
So, someone who looks at cells

00:20:34.999 --> 00:20:39.286
from cervical Pap smears all the
time can quickly tell if there's

00:20:39.286 --> 00:20:43.439
the danger that there might be a
tumor growing within a patient

00:20:43.439 --> 00:20:47.292
who's had a smear like this.
Now, this requires a visit

00:20:47.292 --> 00:20:50.867
to the office and a procedure;
wouldn't it be nice if there

00:20:50.867 --> 00:20:54.019
were blood tests that you could
do for cancer?

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:55.890
Of all the technologies we
talked about;

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.866
we talked about ELISA's for
example and all the ways that we

00:20:58.866 --> 00:21:01.641
can look into the blood to try
to see what chemicals are

00:21:01.641 --> 00:21:04.291
present there.
If you could find chemical

00:21:04.291 --> 00:21:07.910
signatures of cancer that could
be detected in blood,

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.087
or in urine,
or in some other fluid from the

00:21:10.087 --> 00:21:11.910
body, that would be a great
thing.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.625
Unfortunately,
there aren't too many examples

00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:16.882
of that yet.
We don't know how to do that

00:21:16.882 --> 00:21:19.205
very well.
We do know for prostate cancer

00:21:19.205 --> 00:21:22.875
and for certain other kinds of
cancers there are molecules that

00:21:22.875 --> 00:21:26.517
you can detect in the blood.
In prostate cancer there's a

00:21:26.517 --> 00:21:30.198
very particular molecule called
prostate specific antigen,

00:21:30.198 --> 00:21:32.413
PSA.
If the levels of PSA rise in

00:21:32.413 --> 00:21:36.319
your blood, that's a sign that
there's something going wrong in

00:21:36.319 --> 00:21:39.470
your prostate and you get a more
thorough exam.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.378
Blood tests are available but
only for certain kinds of

00:21:42.378 --> 00:21:44.748
cancers and they're not widely
available yet,

00:21:44.748 --> 00:21:47.009
although we would like for them
to be.

00:21:47.009 --> 00:21:50.624
If you have a high--if
you're a male and you have an

00:21:50.624 --> 00:21:54.172
abnormally high prostate
specific antigen level in your

00:21:54.172 --> 00:21:56.732
blood,
you might get a more thorough

00:21:56.732 --> 00:22:00.275
examination and you might
use--and your physician might

00:22:00.275 --> 00:22:03.490
use an approach like ultrasound
guided biopsy.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.370
Here, if you can see in this
diagram here,

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.586
this is a much less pleasant
experience then a blood test but

00:22:10.586 --> 00:22:14.942
there's a device that's inserted
through the rectum up to close

00:22:14.942 --> 00:22:19.350
to where the prostate is.
This device has an ultrasound

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.734
probe on it.
You can look by ultrasound into

00:22:22.734 --> 00:22:27.119
this region of the body,
identify where the prostate is,

00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:30.955
and even where a growth on the
prostate might be and then a

00:22:30.955 --> 00:22:34.724
needle comes out from this
device and takes a small sample

00:22:34.724 --> 00:22:37.800
of tissue.
This tissue is then taken to

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.410
the laboratory and looked at in
the same way that a Pap smear

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.657
might be looked at.
We talked about using

00:22:45.657 --> 00:22:49.083
optical microscopy or using
optical instruments to probe

00:22:49.083 --> 00:22:52.259
inside the body into cavities
that we can't see.

00:22:52.259 --> 00:22:55.600
There's lots of technology
available for this now,

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.599
including sigmoidoscopes and
colonoscopes,

00:22:58.599 --> 00:23:03.837
which are fiber optic systems
that can be inserted into the

00:23:03.837 --> 00:23:06.718
colon.
Can be--if they're designed

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:11.514
properly, inserted very far up
into the colon to actually let

00:23:11.514 --> 00:23:16.071
you look through a lens at
what's happening on the surface

00:23:16.071 --> 00:23:20.008
of the tissue.
This has been a very important

00:23:20.008 --> 00:23:24.120
advance in terms of identifying
cancer of the colon,

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.511
for example.
Similar scopes are available to

00:23:27.511 --> 00:23:31.664
look in the lung for lung cancer
and to look in a variety of

00:23:31.664 --> 00:23:36.240
other sites in the body to look
for cancer and other diseases.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:41.461
A lot of engineering technology
has been brought to bear on the

00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:46.430
problem of diagnosing cancer and
diagnosing cancer early.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.829
What do you do if a cancer
is present?

00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:53.841
Well the--arguably the oldest
form of cancer therapy is

00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:57.287
surgery.
Surgery is used for biopsy to

00:23:57.287 --> 00:24:01.627
take small samples to see if a
growth, for example,

00:24:01.627 --> 00:24:04.849
is abnormal.
If you have an abnormal growth

00:24:04.849 --> 00:24:07.602
on your skin,
the surgeon might cut off some

00:24:07.602 --> 00:24:11.506
of that tissue and send it to a
laboratory for analysis and to

00:24:11.506 --> 00:24:15.570
find out if it's cancer or not.
Also used for looking deeper in

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:19.212
the body, surgery is.
Surgery is used for prevention

00:24:19.212 --> 00:24:21.629
of cancer.
If you have abnormal growths

00:24:21.629 --> 00:24:24.542
called polyps in the colon,
a surgeon can remove those

00:24:24.542 --> 00:24:27.785
polyps and prevent them from
progressing into a more serious

00:24:27.785 --> 00:24:30.158
disease.
Polyps on their own aren't

00:24:30.158 --> 00:24:33.603
necessarily cancerous but they
can develop into cancer,

00:24:33.603 --> 00:24:35.900
there's an association with
that.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.465
So, why not remove them
surgically before they have the

00:24:39.465 --> 00:24:42.794
chance?
Surgeries often remove--used to

00:24:42.794 --> 00:24:46.940
remove local tumors in the lung,
in the brain,

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.027
the colon, the prostate,
so surgery is a well

00:24:51.027 --> 00:24:54.650
established form of cancer
treatment.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.059
Radiation can also be used
to treat cancer.

00:24:57.059 --> 00:25:01.499
This relates to the subject of
imaging that we talked about

00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:04.081
several weeks ago.
We talked about using

00:25:04.081 --> 00:25:06.785
electromagnetic radiation
because it can penetrate into

00:25:06.785 --> 00:25:09.839
the body and using that to take
pictures of what's inside.

00:25:09.839 --> 00:25:14.403
But we also talked about forms
of radiation that had biological

00:25:14.403 --> 00:25:16.890
effects.
We talked about ionizing

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:20.464
radiation, for example,
and ionizing radiation can

00:25:20.464 --> 00:25:24.885
cause changes in the body.
This is radiation that's on the

00:25:24.885 --> 00:25:28.008
high frequency,
short wavelength end of the

00:25:28.008 --> 00:25:32.301
electromagnetic spectrum.
So, X-rays or gamma rays,

00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:35.309
high frequency,
small wavelength.

00:25:35.309 --> 00:25:39.884
They can penetrate through
tissues very easily and they can

00:25:39.884 --> 00:25:44.615
interact with atoms and nuclei
inside of the molecules inside

00:25:44.615 --> 00:25:47.400
your body.
Ionizing radiation,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.126
these forms of high energy
radiation have biological

00:25:51.126 --> 00:25:54.204
effects.
We talked about one of those

00:25:54.204 --> 00:25:59.242
effects is that they can cause
the ejection or the deviation of

00:25:59.242 --> 00:26:02.329
electrons on atoms within the
skin.

00:26:02.329 --> 00:26:05.512
These change,
these ionizations that occur as

00:26:05.512 --> 00:26:09.129
a electrons are ejected from
atoms within the skin,

00:26:09.129 --> 00:26:12.918
can cause cell damage.
This kind of ionization is

00:26:12.918 --> 00:26:16.525
happening all the time.
You go out in the sun and

00:26:16.525 --> 00:26:20.660
radiation impinges on your skin,
it causes some damage.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:26.337
There are forms of ionizing
radiation present at low levels

00:26:26.337 --> 00:26:30.980
in the environment around us,.
Ordinarily that causes no

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.365
problem because the cells in
your body are able to repair

00:26:34.365 --> 00:26:36.988
damage.
You have repair mechanisms,

00:26:36.988 --> 00:26:41.250
either by producing new cells
or by repairing the DNA that

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:45.951
gets damaged in cells,
you can recover from the damage

00:26:45.951 --> 00:26:49.139
that happens.
But if radiation continues to

00:26:49.139 --> 00:26:52.826
be delivered to that tissue,
you can overwhelm the body's

00:26:52.826 --> 00:26:56.854
ability to repair itself.
You can actually cause sections

00:26:56.854 --> 00:27:00.588
of tissues or cells within
sections of tissues to die,

00:27:00.588 --> 00:27:03.829
and that's the basis for
radiation therapy.

00:27:03.829 --> 00:27:08.361
This graph which is--which
describes an experiment that was

00:27:08.361 --> 00:27:12.234
done many decades ago,
shows how radiation can be used

00:27:12.234 --> 00:27:15.484
to kill cells.
This axis here shows a dose of

00:27:15.484 --> 00:27:18.579
radiation that's delivered to
cells in culture.

00:27:18.579 --> 00:27:22.704
Radiation is focused on a Petri
dish that contains cells and

00:27:22.704 --> 00:27:26.269
then you expose them to some
amount of radiation.

00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:29.799
The dose of radiation is going
up as you move this way.

00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:33.906
Then, you look to see how many
cells survived that procedure,

00:27:33.906 --> 00:27:37.259
how many cells survived this
dose of radiation.

00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:41.815
Let's look at a dose of 6 Gy
here, Gy is a radiation unit

00:27:41.815 --> 00:27:45.347
called the Gray.
At this dose of Gy's,

00:27:45.347 --> 00:27:50.762
if you move up this scale here,
you'll kill all but .001

00:27:50.762 --> 00:27:54.700
fraction or .1% of bone marrow
cells.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.866
You would kill most of the bone
marrow cells that were exposed

00:27:57.866 --> 00:28:01.402
by radiation of this kind.
You would kill about 90% of

00:28:01.402 --> 00:28:05.490
cells from the breast,
and you would kill even less of

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:10.017
these other kinds of cells here.
That illustrates another

00:28:10.017 --> 00:28:14.000
point, that cells have different
sensitivities to radiation.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.738
If you know something about the
type of cells you're trying to

00:28:18.738 --> 00:28:22.034
treat by radiation,
then you can adjust the dose

00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:25.660
that you give so you're killing
only the ones that you want.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.329
Some cells are always going to
be susceptible.

00:28:28.329 --> 00:28:31.043
Cells of the bone marrow,
for example,

00:28:31.043 --> 00:28:37.380
very susceptible to radiation.
How do you avoid that problem?

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.721
That you want to kill cells of
the tumor but you don't want to

00:28:40.721 --> 00:28:43.734
kill cells that are also
sensitive to radiation in other

00:28:43.734 --> 00:28:46.599
parts of the body?
You do that by just focusing

00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:49.029
the radiation on the site that
you want.

00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:52.019
You do it by localizing where
the radiation is delivered.

00:28:52.019 --> 00:28:55.506
So, biomedical engineers
and physicists have developed

00:28:55.506 --> 00:28:57.829
methods for external beam
radiation.

00:28:57.829 --> 00:29:00.381
These are devices that look
somewhat like the imaging

00:29:00.381 --> 00:29:02.539
systems we talked about several
weeks ago.

00:29:02.539 --> 00:29:06.278
They're delivering high doses
of ionizing radiation and you

00:29:06.278 --> 00:29:10.275
can see that perhaps that this
thing is on a cradle that swings

00:29:10.275 --> 00:29:13.914
back and forth,
and there are lenses in here to

00:29:13.914 --> 00:29:17.529
focus the radiation.
The physician can move it to

00:29:17.529 --> 00:29:21.770
whatever site that he wants in
three dimensions and focus the

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.799
beam so it hits only the tissue
that you want to expose to

00:29:25.799 --> 00:29:29.037
radiation.
These techniques depend very

00:29:29.037 --> 00:29:33.314
much on computers and on
mathematical models of what the

00:29:33.314 --> 00:29:36.269
tissue looks like inside your
body,

00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:39.880
they're guided by imaging
methods, but the idea is to

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.700
deliver only radiation at the
site that you want too.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.591
Can you do a perfect job?
No, but you can do a pretty

00:29:46.591 --> 00:29:50.335
good job in focusing the
radiation at the site that you

00:29:50.335 --> 00:29:52.240
want.
This is described a little bit

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.769
more in the chapter in your
book.

00:29:53.769 --> 00:29:56.787
Another way to get
radiation delivered only where

00:29:56.787 --> 00:30:00.326
you want is to put the radiation
source inside the body in the

00:30:00.326 --> 00:30:03.460
location you want and that's
called Brachytherapy.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.919
This is an example of a
prostate tumor that's filled

00:30:06.919 --> 00:30:10.990
with what looked like little
stars, or little bright dots.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.997
Each one of these bright dots
is a small metal seed that's

00:30:13.997 --> 00:30:15.950
filled with a radioactive
material.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:19.271
Those are implanted physically
in the tissue,

00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:23.500
and then the tissue around it
is exposed to radiation.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.470
It's a special kind of
radiation that only penetrates a

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:29.030
certain depth in the tissue.
As it penetrates,

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.190
it delivers ionizing radiation
to all the cells around it.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:37.106
You can see these small seeds
are arrayed throughout the

00:30:37.106 --> 00:30:42.559
tissue so that you can treat it
as uniformally as possible.

00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:47.190
So, radiation can be used to
treat tumors.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:51.079
Another thing I wanted to
show you on this slide here is

00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:55.034
that some cells can be made to
be more sensitive to radiation

00:30:55.034 --> 00:30:59.341
and they ordinarily are.
That example is shown here with

00:30:59.341 --> 00:31:03.868
these human cells that have
been--well, that they lack the

00:31:03.868 --> 00:31:08.226
normal DNA repair mechanisms.
Cells that lack DNA repair

00:31:08.226 --> 00:31:12.000
mechanisms, if you expose them
to ionizing radiation;

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.302
they're much more sensitive
because they don't have the

00:31:16.302 --> 00:31:19.569
mechanisms to repair sub-lethal
damage.

00:31:19.569 --> 00:31:24.183
One important area of research
is trying to find drugs that you

00:31:24.183 --> 00:31:28.648
can deliver that will accumulate
in tumor tissue to make them

00:31:28.648 --> 00:31:32.722
more sensitive to radiation,
which you then deliver in the

00:31:32.722 --> 00:31:35.397
ways that I've described.
There are a variety of

00:31:35.397 --> 00:31:38.556
different approaches that are
under study here for delivering

00:31:38.556 --> 00:31:41.421
radiation more carefully,
more selectively,

00:31:41.421 --> 00:31:45.842
to specific regions of the
body, and to design drugs or

00:31:45.842 --> 00:31:50.918
other strategies to make tumors
more sensitive to the radiation

00:31:50.918 --> 00:31:53.960
you deliver.
You know about chemotherapy.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.930
Again, this is a slide that I
don't intend for you to be able

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:01.829
to read on your--in your
leisure,

00:32:01.829 --> 00:32:06.080
you can look at the slide when
it's posted and just gives you

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.260
some idea of the breadth of
knowledge that we now have about

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.415
chemotherapy drugs.
There are many different

00:32:13.415 --> 00:32:16.975
classes of drugs that have been
developed and studied and

00:32:16.975 --> 00:32:21.036
employed for treating cancer.
Most of these drugs work in a

00:32:21.036 --> 00:32:23.831
similar fashion,
by interfering with DNA,

00:32:23.831 --> 00:32:27.884
or by interfering with the
mechanisms by which cells repair

00:32:27.884 --> 00:32:30.819
DNA so that you can halt cell
growth.

00:32:30.819 --> 00:32:34.308
If you crosslink all the DNA
inside of a cell it can't

00:32:34.308 --> 00:32:37.505
synthesize any more DNA.
Then, it can't divide and

00:32:37.505 --> 00:32:41.190
proliferate and that's the basis
of action for many of these,

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.676
although not all,
so I'll let you look at those

00:32:43.676 --> 00:32:46.354
at your leisure.
One of the problems with

00:32:46.354 --> 00:32:50.068
chemotherapy is that these drugs
have effect not only on tumor

00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:52.930
cells but they have effects on
normal cells.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.900
If you deliver chemotherapy
throughout the body,

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.829
not only do you have an effect
on the tumor,

00:32:56.829 --> 00:33:00.273
an effect that you want,
but you have an effect on other

00:33:00.273 --> 00:33:01.802
tissues.
In particular,

00:33:01.802 --> 00:33:05.734
the kinds of tissues where cell
growth, controlled cell growth

00:33:05.734 --> 00:33:08.569
is an important part of their
physiology;

00:33:08.569 --> 00:33:11.595
the intestine,
the bone marrow,

00:33:11.595 --> 00:33:15.558
your hair, skin.
Patients who have chemotherapy

00:33:15.558 --> 00:33:19.640
often get digestive problems,
severe digestive problems.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.930
T hey get anemia,
or infections because they're

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:24.470
not producing cells in their
bone marrow anymore.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:27.693
They lose their hair because
hair is produced by cells that

00:33:27.693 --> 00:33:29.250
are dividing,
in the skin.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.521
They get rashes and other skin
symptoms because their skin

00:33:32.521 --> 00:33:35.276
isn't repairing and remodeling
in the normal way,

00:33:35.276 --> 00:33:37.812
you know this.
One concept that has

00:33:37.812 --> 00:33:41.693
emerged over the last 10 years
or so is to deliver chemotherapy

00:33:41.693 --> 00:33:45.074
drugs locally instead of
delivering them over the whole

00:33:45.074 --> 00:33:47.489
body.
I gave you this example from my

00:33:47.489 --> 00:33:51.127
own research lab a few weeks ago
when we were talking about drug

00:33:51.127 --> 00:33:53.255
delivery.
Just to remind you,

00:33:53.255 --> 00:33:57.410
here's a situation where
there's a tumor in the brain.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:02.475
This can be treated by surgery,
and in this case the surgeons

00:34:02.475 --> 00:34:05.430
were given drug delivery
systems.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:08.657
These were degradable polymer
wafers that were filled with

00:34:08.657 --> 00:34:10.809
high concentrations of
chemotherapy.

00:34:10.809 --> 00:34:13.654
In the operating room,
after they removed the tumor,

00:34:13.654 --> 00:34:16.889
they can place these drug
delivery systems in the brain.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.878
The patient leaves the
operating room with most of the

00:34:19.878 --> 00:34:22.416
tumor removed,
and with high dose chemotherapy

00:34:22.416 --> 00:34:25.800
delivered locally over a long
period of time after they leave

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.735
the operating room.
This should remind you of the

00:34:28.735 --> 00:34:31.260
Brachytherapy we talked about a
few slides ago.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.026
Instead of depositing a dose of
radiation in here,

00:34:35.026 --> 00:34:39.244
we deposited a dose of drugs.
Deposited it in a way that

00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:42.489
these drugs could be released
slowly over time,

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:46.651
and hopefully locally kill any
residual tumor cells that are

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:49.896
remaining.
One of the most impressive,

00:34:49.896 --> 00:34:53.704
important and exciting new
developments over the last 5

00:34:53.704 --> 00:34:58.006
years has been the development
of new chemotherapy agents that

00:34:58.006 --> 00:35:02.590
work by mechanisms of action
that were not known previously.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:06.782
This is an example of modern
biology and our understanding of

00:35:06.782 --> 00:35:09.293
cancer biology,
in particular,

00:35:09.293 --> 00:35:14.490
leading to the design of drugs
that are more specific to

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.633
cancers,
because they take advantage of

00:35:17.633 --> 00:35:21.070
mechanisms that only cancer
cells typically use.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.550
One of those is a drug called
Gleevec.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:29.050
Remember in the 4^(th) week of
the class we talked about cell

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.436
communication.
We talked about signal

00:35:31.436 --> 00:35:34.616
transduction and how messages
get from the outside of a cell

00:35:34.616 --> 00:35:38.659
into the inside of a cell.
We talked about how important a

00:35:38.659 --> 00:35:43.380
class of signaling molecules
called tyrosine kinases were to

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:48.095
creating intracellular signals.
Well, it turns out that

00:35:48.095 --> 00:35:52.752
certain kinds of tumors you use
a special tyrosine kinase called

00:35:52.752 --> 00:35:56.965
BCRABL and that that tyrosine
kinase can be inhibited by a

00:35:56.965 --> 00:36:00.070
drug that was designed to
inhibit it,

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:03.079
called Gleevec.
Now, this is one of the first

00:36:03.079 --> 00:36:05.840
examples of what's called
rational drug design,

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.780
in that biologists have
identified this particular

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:12.284
tyrosine kinase.
They knew it was involved in

00:36:12.284 --> 00:36:16.774
signaling inside certain kinds
of cancers, in particular,

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:21.567
a certain kind of lymphoma.
They studied this molecule in

00:36:21.567 --> 00:36:24.941
its molecular detail and
developed a drug,

00:36:24.941 --> 00:36:28.892
now called Gleevec,
that would interfere with the

00:36:28.892 --> 00:36:33.183
action of that molecule.
Interfere only with the action

00:36:33.183 --> 00:36:37.182
of that molecule and not all the
other tyrosine kinases that are

00:36:37.182 --> 00:36:40.989
important for healthy cell life
in the rest of your body.

00:36:40.989 --> 00:36:43.889
This drug prevents kinase
activity;

00:36:43.889 --> 00:36:47.139
it does it by blocking the
binding site for ATP.

00:36:47.139 --> 00:36:51.904
Remember that ATP was a second
messenger that kinases use in

00:36:51.904 --> 00:36:56.515
order to phosphorylate protein.
This is an exciting example

00:36:56.515 --> 00:37:00.837
because it's the first--one of
the first examples of rational

00:37:00.837 --> 00:37:05.015
design of a drug at a very
specific molecular target inside

00:37:05.015 --> 00:37:07.722
tumors.
Now, unfortunately,

00:37:07.722 --> 00:37:10.824
it's limited.
Gleevec is limited in its use

00:37:10.824 --> 00:37:14.253
to only a couple of subclasses
of tumors that express this

00:37:14.253 --> 00:37:16.780
tyrosine kinase at high
concentrations,

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:21.273
but I think the idea of it is
one that can be translated

00:37:21.273 --> 00:37:23.389
outside.
Another new drug that's

00:37:23.389 --> 00:37:26.179
been developed in the last two
years is called Herceptin.

00:37:26.179 --> 00:37:28.949
Now, Herceptin is unique in a
number of different ways.

00:37:28.949 --> 00:37:32.144
One is that it's an antibody,
and we talked about the role of

00:37:32.144 --> 00:37:35.019
antibodies in the immune
response several weeks ago.

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:38.538
We talked about how vaccines
are often designed in order to

00:37:38.538 --> 00:37:41.632
get your body to produce
antibodies to an infectious

00:37:41.632 --> 00:37:43.760
disease.
So, you're familiar with the

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.409
concept of using antibodies to
neutralize pathogens.

00:37:46.409 --> 00:37:51.008
Here's an antibody that was
designed to bind to a receptor

00:37:51.008 --> 00:37:54.720
that appears only on cells in
breast cancer.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.849
This receptor is called HER2;
it's a form of a growth factor

00:37:59.849 --> 00:38:04.688
receptor that is particularly
highly expressed in some kinds

00:38:04.688 --> 00:38:07.995
of breast cancers.
If you deliver this

00:38:07.995 --> 00:38:11.442
molecule Herceptin,
it's an antibody which binds to

00:38:11.442 --> 00:38:14.889
this receptor and prevents its
normal function.

00:38:14.889 --> 00:38:20.343
Its normal function is to
signal breast cancer cells to

00:38:20.343 --> 00:38:23.039
grow.
When this antibody binds,

00:38:23.039 --> 00:38:27.813
it shuts off that growth signal
that the breast tumor cell is

00:38:27.813 --> 00:38:31.447
getting from this receptor.
It also promotes the immune

00:38:31.447 --> 00:38:34.019
response to the tumor.
You can imagine if this is a

00:38:34.019 --> 00:38:37.360
breast cancer cell that has lots
of these receptor molecules on

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.840
the surface and now you put in
an antibody,

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.052
you deliver an antibody which
gets coated on the surface,

00:38:43.052 --> 00:38:45.920
now this surface is
tagged--this cell is tagged for

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.099
recognition by your immune
system.

00:38:48.099 --> 00:38:54.480
The immune system can develop a
response to this tumor as well.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.679
These are both exciting new
potential therapies for cancer.

00:38:58.679 --> 00:39:02.245
They're real therapies for some
cancer, but point the way

00:39:02.245 --> 00:39:06.065
towards more broadly applicable
methods that might be used to

00:39:06.065 --> 00:39:10.090
designing chemotherapy agents.
The problem is that it takes a

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:13.810
long time and a lot of money,
and a lot of effort in order to

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:17.407
get from the point where you
design a new chemotherapy drug

00:39:17.407 --> 00:39:20.570
to the point where it can be
used in patients.

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:23.392
I thought I would end this
lecture by just reviewing a

00:39:23.392 --> 00:39:26.534
little bit about that process
and try to get you a sense for

00:39:26.534 --> 00:39:28.527
why,
in practical terms,

00:39:28.527 --> 00:39:33.310
there haven't been more drugs
developed for cancer over the

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:37.696
past several decades.
The process occurs in steps

00:39:37.696 --> 00:39:42.509
and I'm going to look at it over
a time scale of about 20 years

00:39:42.509 --> 00:39:45.369
here.
It involves both testing in

00:39:45.369 --> 00:39:49.250
vitro, testing in test tubes
in the laboratory.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:52.319
Testing, often in cell
cultures, to look for drugs that

00:39:52.319 --> 00:39:55.900
have properties that you think
might make them useful cancer.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.384
Usually from the time that you
think about a drug,

00:40:00.384 --> 00:40:04.502
I have a drug,
say drug X and I think it might

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:09.170
inhibit this signaling pathway
in colon cancer.

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.958
So, what do I do first?
I get some colon cancer cells,

00:40:11.958 --> 00:40:15.090
I expose it to the drug,
I see if it works in culture.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:18.110
This is all called the
discovery phase.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:21.333
The next stage I might do if I
find that my drug works well in

00:40:21.333 --> 00:40:24.239
cultured cells and I'm starting
to uncover the molecular

00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:27.730
mechanisms and how it works,
is test it in animals.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:30.990
I might take animals that have
colon cancer and try to treat

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:34.231
them with a drug.
This is still in discovery and

00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:37.519
this is a phase that--called
animal testing.

00:40:37.519 --> 00:40:40.409
Now, you begin to refine
your approach.

00:40:40.409 --> 00:40:43.087
You begin to refine your
approach such that you're

00:40:43.087 --> 00:40:46.366
starting to test not only for
the activity in animals because

00:40:46.366 --> 00:40:50.105
you find that,
'Yes, your drug X does--is an

00:40:50.105 --> 00:40:54.466
effective treatment for cancer.'
You trying to think about

00:40:54.466 --> 00:40:57.066
what's the optimal dose,
how much dose would I need if

00:40:57.066 --> 00:40:58.929
this worked the same way in
people.

00:40:58.929 --> 00:41:02.398
You start testing different
aspects of it in animals in

00:41:02.398 --> 00:41:04.710
preparation for testing in
people.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:07.766
That's called,
that first step in vitro

00:41:07.766 --> 00:41:10.785
is called lead discovery.
My lead drug is X,

00:41:10.785 --> 00:41:13.617
this is a promising lead that
I'm following,

00:41:13.617 --> 00:41:16.909
and in animal testing you do
lead optimization.

00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:20.999
All of this takes a long time,
could take 4 years from the

00:41:20.999 --> 00:41:24.446
point that you think,
'Maybe this drug is good,' to,

00:41:24.446 --> 00:41:27.679
'Yes I've shown that really is
effective in animals.'

00:41:27.679 --> 00:41:30.768
Then, a process of clinical
testing happens,

00:41:30.768 --> 00:41:33.659
and the clinical testing occurs
in phases.

00:41:33.659 --> 00:41:36.698
In order to do testing
clinically, you have to be

00:41:36.698 --> 00:41:39.230
approved by the government to do
that.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.387
In this country an organization
called the Food and Drug

00:41:42.387 --> 00:41:43.880
Administration,
the FDA,

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.013
is the only one that can give
you approval to take--to test an

00:41:47.013 --> 00:41:50.438
experimental medicine in people.
They do that because you file

00:41:50.438 --> 00:41:53.621
an application called an IND or
Investigational New Drug

00:41:53.621 --> 00:41:55.542
application.
They look at all the data

00:41:55.542 --> 00:41:57.900
you've collected over the last
four years and they say,

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.546
'Yes you've convinced us that
this looks like a good drug,

00:42:00.546 --> 00:42:03.484
it looks like it'll be safe,
you can go ahead and start

00:42:03.484 --> 00:42:06.740
testing it in people.'
You first do small studies,

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:10.154
you deliver to a few people,
usually not people that have

00:42:10.154 --> 00:42:13.019
disease, but people that don't
have disease.

00:42:13.019 --> 00:42:16.276
You deliver it in small doses
and you slowly increase the

00:42:16.276 --> 00:42:18.369
amount of dose that you give
them.

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:21.219
What you're looking for here is
not effectiveness of the drug

00:42:21.219 --> 00:42:23.730
but you're looking for safety.
Is it safe?

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:26.550
What dose do I begin to see
side effects?

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:30.504
This allows you to narrow in
the range that you're going to

00:42:30.504 --> 00:42:34.117
use in people to test this drug
for its effectiveness,

00:42:34.117 --> 00:42:38.021
that's called Phase I.
Phase II, you start to look in

00:42:38.021 --> 00:42:42.283
patients that have the disease
in a small number of patients,

00:42:42.283 --> 00:42:46.190
to just look to see if the drug
is effective or not.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:49.201
Phase I, you're asking whether
it's safe, in Phase II you're

00:42:49.201 --> 00:42:52.365
asking if it's effective in the
patients that you would like to

00:42:52.365 --> 00:42:54.570
use it in.
You do that in a small number

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:57.756
of patients first just because
this is the first time it's been

00:42:57.756 --> 00:43:00.891
used to test effectiveness in
people and you're not quite sure

00:43:00.891 --> 00:43:03.903
what's going to happen.
So, you do it in a small number

00:43:03.903 --> 00:43:07.050
of patients just to show that it
works the way that you want.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:10.988
If it does work the way you
want you start Phase III which

00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:14.474
is a very large clinical study
that is in the number of

00:43:14.474 --> 00:43:18.413
patients you need to show that
it is effective at treating the

00:43:18.413 --> 00:43:21.665
kind of cancer you want.
How many patients are involved

00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:24.818
in studies like this?
Well, it could be hundreds,

00:43:24.818 --> 00:43:27.611
could be thousands.
Depends on the disease,

00:43:27.611 --> 00:43:30.566
how prevalent the disease is,
what the normal course of the

00:43:30.566 --> 00:43:33.590
disease is,
and how many patients you need

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:37.902
to look at in order to be
absolutely sure that you saw an

00:43:37.902 --> 00:43:41.059
effect that wasn't just due to
chance.

00:43:41.059 --> 00:43:43.167
These are very complicated
studies to do,

00:43:43.167 --> 00:43:45.849
and hence very expensive.
Remember when we were

00:43:45.849 --> 00:43:48.367
talking about vaccines,
we talked about a Phase III

00:43:48.367 --> 00:43:51.489
study of the polio vaccine that
was invented by Jonas Salk.

00:43:51.489 --> 00:43:54.550
How many patients were involved
in that clinical study,

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:57.852
does anybody remember?
How many patients were involved

00:43:57.852 --> 00:44:01.300
in that Phase III clinical study
of the polio vaccine?

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.630
Who could remember that?
I remember;

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:08.486
1.8 million eight year olds
were involved in that study,

00:44:08.486 --> 00:44:10.869
so clinical studies can be
huge.

00:44:10.869 --> 00:44:14.336
In the case of an infectious
disease, it's particularly a

00:44:14.336 --> 00:44:18.173
large number because you need to
deliver it to enough people to

00:44:18.173 --> 00:44:21.979
see--a vaccine,
to see that you've changed the

00:44:21.979 --> 00:44:25.659
incidence of disease within a
population.

00:44:25.659 --> 00:44:28.795
In cancer trials,
they tend to be hundreds or

00:44:28.795 --> 00:44:31.592
thousands in size.
If this Phase III trial

00:44:31.592 --> 00:44:33.829
works then you're allowed to
sell the drug.

00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:37.007
The FDA gives you permission to
sell the drug,

00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:39.619
and for physicians to prescribe
it.

00:44:39.619 --> 00:44:42.951
The study doesn't end there,
in that all manufacturers of

00:44:42.951 --> 00:44:46.758
drugs are required to keep track
of what happens as their drug is

00:44:46.758 --> 00:44:50.409
introduced into the population.
This is called Phase IV,

00:44:50.409 --> 00:44:54.531
as physicians start using it to
treat cancer they're required to

00:44:54.531 --> 00:44:58.233
look at how these things work.
You will have noticed,

00:44:58.233 --> 00:45:02.231
in the newspaper over the past
few years, some very famous

00:45:02.231 --> 00:45:06.019
drugs that turned out to have
side effects that weren't

00:45:06.019 --> 00:45:09.457
expected after they were
released into the general

00:45:09.457 --> 00:45:12.292
population.
Once it starts being used by

00:45:12.292 --> 00:45:15.548
physicians all over the country
in many, many more patients

00:45:15.548 --> 00:45:18.636
sometimes rare side effects
appear that we didn't expect

00:45:18.636 --> 00:45:20.904
before.
So, one continues to do

00:45:20.904 --> 00:45:23.400
research and study even after
that.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.822
The challenge for drug
companies is that this takes a

00:45:26.822 --> 00:45:29.389
very long time,
it takes a lot of money.

00:45:29.389 --> 00:45:34.139
There's lots of places where
your drug can fail.

00:45:34.139 --> 00:45:37.256
My drug X, which I described as
going neatly through in

00:45:37.256 --> 00:45:39.359
vitro studies,
animal testing,

00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:43.329
clinical testing might have
stopped working at some stage.

00:45:43.329 --> 00:45:46.684
I might have found some problem
with its safety when I started

00:45:46.684 --> 00:45:49.765
testing it in human volunteers.
I might have found that it

00:45:49.765 --> 00:45:52.636
didn't work as well in animals
as I expected it too based on

00:45:52.636 --> 00:45:56.523
in vitro studies.
People estimate that for every

00:45:56.523 --> 00:46:00.556
10,000 compounds,
10,000 X's that are thought of

00:46:00.556 --> 00:46:04.246
in laboratories,
only one of them eventually

00:46:04.246 --> 00:46:08.414
gets approved by the FDA.
This is why drug development

00:46:08.414 --> 00:46:11.547
costs so much money in this
country, because you have to

00:46:11.547 --> 00:46:15.022
look at a lot of compounds and
test them pretty extensively to

00:46:15.022 --> 00:46:18.440
find the one that's really
useful for treating disease.

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.544
I don't think we want to
change that, because this

00:46:21.544 --> 00:46:25.000
process of FDA approval was
introduced early in this century

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.280
when people were selling drugs
out of the back of covered

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.739
wagons and moving from town to
town.

00:46:30.739 --> 00:46:35.070
They're called snake oil
salesmen or other things.

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:38.186
People could sell anything they
wanted and claimed that it

00:46:38.186 --> 00:46:40.959
treated a disease.
Now, we have a very highly

00:46:40.959 --> 00:46:45.029
refined system for asking people
that are going to sell drugs to

00:46:45.029 --> 00:46:48.298
prove that they work,
but that system costs a lot of

00:46:48.298 --> 00:46:50.022
money.
There are opportunities,

00:46:50.022 --> 00:46:52.888
I think, for biomedical
engineers to improve how this

00:46:52.888 --> 00:46:55.753
works by designing better
methods for in vitro

00:46:55.753 --> 00:46:58.291
study.
By using techniques we talked

00:46:58.291 --> 00:47:01.555
about, like in cell culture
early on, to use those

00:47:01.555 --> 00:47:06.031
techniques more efficiently,
to discover and test properties

00:47:06.031 --> 00:47:08.703
of drugs.
So, this is going to be an area

00:47:08.703 --> 00:47:12.429
where I think there is lots of
growth and opportunities in the

00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:14.889
future.
Just in closing,

00:47:14.889 --> 00:47:18.820
I just put this website up
there;

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:22.996
it's from Science Magazine
which is a very high-profile

00:47:22.996 --> 00:47:26.827
scientific journal.
They published a poster which

00:47:26.827 --> 00:47:30.633
is available online that talks
about sort of modern

00:47:30.633 --> 00:47:34.440
developments in cancer diagnosis
and treatment.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.754
I put a few sort of snapshots
from that poster into the Power

00:47:37.754 --> 00:47:40.239
Point presentation which will be
available.

00:47:40.239 --> 00:47:43.530
I encourage you to go to this
website and look at this

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:46.511
information.
You can find out more about

00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:50.813
what are the sort of exciting
pathways for the future in

00:47:50.813 --> 00:47:54.489
biomedical engineering and
cancer treatment.

00:47:54.489 --> 00:47:57.000
Great, so I'll see you on
Thursday.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.385
Prof: Okay,
now let me--I actually would

00:00:04.385 --> 00:00:08.220
like to spend as much time as I
can on Durkheim's methodology.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.890
I have lots of notes.
 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.548
This is the twenty-fourth
lecture, note,

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:18.370
this semester for this course.
 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:24.422
But let me rush through of the
test questions and just to tell

00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:28.490
you how I would like to deal
with them.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.241
I think the first one is very
obvious, probably a bit too

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.090
obvious.
 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.960
The question is how can you
make it interesting?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.568
I hope that the distinction
between power and domination is

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:43.044
clear.
 

00:00:43.044 --> 00:00:43.760
Right?
 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.195
Power means that somebody can
impose its will on somebody

00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:51.760
else, even if that other person
opposes it.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.538
There is a strong element of
coercion involved.

00:00:56.538 --> 00:00:57.370
Right?
 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.118
You can coerce people to obey
your command.

00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:05.822
Domination implies that you do
not have to use coercion

00:01:05.822 --> 00:01:09.706
systematically,
because people tend to

00:01:09.706 --> 00:01:15.923
internalize the reasons those
who have power use in order to

00:01:15.923 --> 00:01:19.820
legitimate why they should have
power.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.980
Right?
 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.218
And then this brings us to the
notion of legitimacy.

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:27.040
Right?
 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.959
Legitimacy are the claims which
are made by those who have

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.022
power,
which try to justify why it is

00:01:34.022 --> 00:01:38.824
reasonable that they should
issue commands and others should

00:01:38.824 --> 00:01:39.720
obey it.
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.690
So far, very simple. Right?
 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.099
What is kind of controversial
about this?

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:52.257
It's controversial the way how
Weber uses the notion of

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:53.500
legitimacy.
 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.494
Normally we,
in modern democratic theory,

00:01:58.494 --> 00:02:06.111
we believe--right?--a system is
legitimate when it has popular

00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:07.608
consent.
 

00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:11.080
We think about universal
suffrage.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.605
People go to free and fair
elections, and then they elect

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:20.212
leaders, and then they follow
those elected to office this

00:02:20.212 --> 00:02:20.860
way.
 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.628
Then power is legitimate.
 

00:02:22.628 --> 00:02:29.030
But I think Weber wants to have
a broader notion of legitimacy.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.818
Because free and fair
elections, operating with

00:02:33.818 --> 00:02:38.400
universal suffrage,
go back one-hundred years in

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.673
human history,
and in some countries it still

00:02:41.673 --> 00:02:42.720
does not exist.
 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.360
And Weber does not want to
describe the last ten minutes of

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.562
human history for human
history's twenty-four hours.

00:02:49.562 --> 00:02:50.190
Right?
 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.703
He wants to offer some
conceptual tools to understand

00:02:53.703 --> 00:02:55.729
the whole twenty-four hours.
 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:59.113
So that's why he has this
interesting notion of

00:02:59.113 --> 00:03:03.060
legitimacy;
which it does imply that people

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.943
have to have a certain degree of
belief in the validity of the

00:03:08.943 --> 00:03:10.968
legitimacy claims.
 

00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:16.780
But it is a rather passive
notion of belief.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.550
They don't have to love the
person in position of authority;

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.919
they do not have to elect it.
 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:27.367
They simply--it's enough if
they think, "Well I cannot

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:30.052
think of a better
alternative."

00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:30.818
Right?
 

00:03:30.818 --> 00:03:34.657
Another dictator could be worse
than this one.

00:03:34.657 --> 00:03:35.340
Right?
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.400
This is a dictator,
but a reasonable one.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.318
And Weber will say,
as long as this is happening,

00:03:42.318 --> 00:03:46.575
the person in authority will
not have to use coercion

00:03:46.575 --> 00:03:50.599
systematically,
and therefore it will be

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.769
legitimate.
 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:52.620
Right?
 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.377
Let me also just say--of
course, the coercive element is

00:03:56.377 --> 00:03:57.675
also in domination.
 

00:03:57.675 --> 00:03:58.288
Right?
 

00:03:58.288 --> 00:04:05.780
If people disobey the law,
then they will be coerced.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.247
There is certainly a promise of
coercion, even in modern free

00:04:13.247 --> 00:04:14.990
democracies.
 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.605
People are put in jail;
in this country people are even

00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:20.300
executed.
 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.920
Right?
 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.990
So there is an element of
coercion.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.882
Just the real question is how
systematic that coercion should

00:04:27.882 --> 00:04:28.290
be?
 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.007
And for Weber,
pure exercise of authority is

00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:34.690
relatively rare and marginal.
 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.283
I would say,
for instance,

00:04:38.283 --> 00:04:46.476
the sort of last year or two or
three of Hitler was fairly

00:04:46.476 --> 00:04:48.920
illegitimate.
 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.850
Hitler had to use massive
coercion.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.923
Certain epochs of rule of
Stalin in the Soviet Union were

00:04:56.923 --> 00:05:00.819
illegitimate,
not all the rule of Stalin.

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.360
During the Second World War he
established some legitimacy.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.720
But when he had to imprison ten
million people--

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.947
right?--and to kill tens of
thousands or hundreds of

00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:16.603
thousands,
that is an indication that this

00:05:16.603 --> 00:05:17.610
is illegitimate.
 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.720
Okay?
 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.855
So that's the way how I would
handle it--right?--to work

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:25.466
around this interesting
conception of legitimacy,

00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:28.250
and what is for and against
this.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.916
Well this is again a very
simple question,

00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:35.495
traditional and legal-rational
authority.

00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:36.389
Right?
 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:41.516
The basic difference
is--right?--that traditional

00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:45.790
authority, you have a personal
master.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.610
In legal-rational authority you
do not have a personal master.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.117
You obey the laws,
and the people who are in

00:05:53.117 --> 00:05:57.769
charge, who are superiors,
will also have to obey the same

00:05:57.769 --> 00:06:00.870
laws, what you are required to
do.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.206
And traditional authority is
legitimated by the sanctity of

00:06:06.206 --> 00:06:07.680
age-old rules.
 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.470
Here again I think the
interesting issue,

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.305
if I would write about this,
will be, well this is a big

00:06:14.305 --> 00:06:16.189
historical distinction.
 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:20.045
But Weber also uses it to
describe, in contemporary

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:23.439
society, different types of
organizations.

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:28.317
So contemporary theory has a
big dose of traditional

00:06:28.317 --> 00:06:34.440
authority in it--right?--and I
would try to elaborate on this.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:40.194
Well this is--right?--one of
the trickier questions:

00:06:40.194 --> 00:06:46.399
Why does Weber believe that
bureaucracy is efficient?

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:52.089
And you may agree or may
disagree with him.

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:55.555
So first of all,
I would state why Weber

00:06:55.555 --> 00:06:59.199
believes that bureaucracy is
efficient.

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:03.317
I would emphasize that he
thinks that bureaucracy is the

00:07:03.317 --> 00:07:06.463
most efficient,
in the technical terms--not

00:07:06.463 --> 00:07:08.410
necessarily otherwise.
 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.416
And then, of course,
the way how he defines

00:07:11.416 --> 00:07:12.420
bureaucracy.
 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:18.110
People are put into position in
terms of their competence.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.589
There is a rule of law.
 

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:24.273
It is a predictable
environment, a bureaucratic

00:07:24.273 --> 00:07:25.089
environment.
 

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:32.755
There is a hierarchy of appeals;
if somebody makes a mistake,

00:07:32.755 --> 00:07:34.110
how to appeal.
 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.910
This, of course,
all makes it efficient.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:43.160
Now we know that bureaucracies
are often inefficient.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.980
So how to reconcile this?
 

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.687
Well it's not that Weber was
totally insensitive to the

00:07:49.687 --> 00:07:53.699
problem of inefficiencies of
bureaucracies,

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:57.970
and he formulated it how that
bureaucracies are caught between

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.560
formal and substantive
rationality.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.216
That's the way how I would
probably defend Weber--to say he

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:07.745
was not that naīve to
believe that bureaucracies are

00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:09.069
always efficient.
 

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:12.906
They would be efficient if they
would be purely formally

00:08:12.906 --> 00:08:14.930
rational, but they are not.
 

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.237
And one good example is welfare
bureaucracies,

00:08:19.237 --> 00:08:23.161
which do establish a kind of
patron-client

00:08:23.161 --> 00:08:29.000
relationships--right?--between
bureaucracies and clients.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.985
Some people refer to this as
welfare dependency,

00:08:32.985 --> 00:08:36.038
which makes it,
of course, a cause of

00:08:36.038 --> 00:08:37.480
inefficiency.
 

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:45.894
Well this is a nice question to
answer, and we discussed this a

00:08:45.894 --> 00:08:47.658
great deal.
 

00:08:47.658 --> 00:08:52.678
We know that charismatic
leaders appear in times of

00:08:52.678 --> 00:08:57.096
crisis, when people are looking
for a change.

00:08:57.096 --> 00:08:58.100
Right?
 

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.702
So Barack Obama,
during the presidential

00:09:01.702 --> 00:09:05.399
campaign, he has read Weber
carefully;

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:08.924
he knew how to
frame--right?--his message

00:09:08.924 --> 00:09:12.009
exactly as a charismatic
message.

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:16.575
It was all about change,
and it was about hope.

00:09:16.575 --> 00:09:17.370
Right?
 

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.678
In contrast with Hillary
Clinton or John McCain.

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:25.379
Both of them emphasized that
"we are experienced'.

00:09:25.379 --> 00:09:30.216
This is not what people wanted
to hear when they wanted to have

00:09:30.216 --> 00:09:30.918
change.
 

00:09:30.918 --> 00:09:36.774
So yes, in this respect,
Barack Obama did have a

00:09:36.774 --> 00:09:43.000
charismatic appeal,
and this charismatic appeal did

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.499
gel.
 

00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:44.870
Right?
 

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.350
Many people responded to his
charisma.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.615
He was criticized by his
opponent that he's a rock

00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:55.350
star--right?--because people got
so excited about him.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.982
So he could appeal to the
emotion of people.

00:09:58.982 --> 00:09:59.659
Right?
 

00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:01.820
He could appeal to them.
 

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.385
But, of course,
as we again discussed in

00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:08.139
discussion sections--
also briefly in class--Barack

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:11.938
Obama has a charismatic appeal,
but he operates in a

00:10:11.938 --> 00:10:13.500
legal-rational authority.
 

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.000
Right?
 

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.513
And we just have seen that very
recently--right?--making a

00:10:17.513 --> 00:10:19.793
decision about the war in
Afghanistan.

00:10:19.793 --> 00:10:20.408
Right?
 

00:10:20.408 --> 00:10:23.995
Well he had to deal with
realities.

00:10:23.995 --> 00:10:24.840
Right?
 

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:32.759
So well Weber would--in the
classical sense,

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:37.490
charisma in Weber is reserved
to great religious leaders,

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:41.399
such as Muhammad or Jesus or
whatever,

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:43.019
or the great prophets.
 

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:48.187
And in this sense charisma is
not really applicable to

00:10:48.187 --> 00:10:53.259
politicians operating in
legal-rational authority.

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:57.643
So Weber would have some unease
to call Barack Obama a

00:10:57.643 --> 00:10:59.379
charismatic leader.
 

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:04.429
I would think he would concede
that certainly Barack Obama had

00:11:04.429 --> 00:11:07.080
charismatic features,
as such.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.379
Now the fifth question:
Durkheim and the study of law.

00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:18.785
Why on earth he starts from the
study of law in analyzing

00:11:18.785 --> 00:11:19.928
society?
 

00:11:19.928 --> 00:11:23.570
Because he's a methodological
collectivist,

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.364
and because he wants to capture
something like the collective

00:11:27.364 --> 00:11:30.456
conscience,
which is more than the sum

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:33.428
total of individual
consciousness.

00:11:33.428 --> 00:11:37.910
But he's also a scientist,
and I hope I will have a little

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.820
time to talk about the
methodology.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.484
He wants to be very rigorous,
and he doesn't want to start

00:11:44.484 --> 00:11:47.190
with ideas;
he wants to start with facts.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.840
Well he's caught in--right?--a
contradiction.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.292
So collective conscience is
ideas.

00:11:55.292 --> 00:11:56.129
Right?
 

00:11:56.129 --> 00:11:58.668
How on earth you study them
objectively?

00:11:58.668 --> 00:12:04.711
And law is a great example,
because law is written down.

00:12:04.711 --> 00:12:05.590
Right?
 

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.048
There is written law.
 

00:12:07.048 --> 00:12:10.279
You can study it objectively,
and it is not only individual

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:12.230
consciousness what guides us
all.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.943
So I think this is the major
reason why his point of

00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:20.240
departure is--as an example--law
because this is what he can

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.769
rigorously study.
 

00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:25.058
It can be seen as a social
fact--right?--

00:12:25.058 --> 00:12:28.395
that this is the law,
and to understand why this law

00:12:28.395 --> 00:12:31.432
came into being,
under what circumstances,

00:12:31.432 --> 00:12:33.870
and how does it influence
people?

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:37.027
Well, of course,
the inspiration comes from

00:12:37.027 --> 00:12:38.080
Montesquieu.
 

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.549
All right.
 

00:12:39.549 --> 00:12:43.509
Well agreement and disagreement.
 

00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:47.129
I think the real question is
whether you buy into

00:12:47.129 --> 00:12:49.918
methodological collectivism or
not.

00:12:49.918 --> 00:12:53.500
Some of you may be
methodological individualists.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.164
Especially if you are an Econ
major, you tend to be an

00:12:58.164 --> 00:13:02.918
economic individualist,
a methodological individualist.

00:13:02.918 --> 00:13:03.798
Right?
 

00:13:03.798 --> 00:13:09.105
You tend to believe that there
are rational individual actors

00:13:09.105 --> 00:13:13.615
who pursue interest,
and you are very skeptical

00:13:13.615 --> 00:13:18.950
about anything which is
assumedly above the individual.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.528
So in that case,
if you are a methodological

00:13:21.528 --> 00:13:23.432
individualist--
and, in fact,

00:13:23.432 --> 00:13:27.028
I think the dominant trend in
social sciences today is

00:13:27.028 --> 00:13:31.371
methodological individualism and
a great deal of skepticism about

00:13:31.371 --> 00:13:37.532
methodological collectivism--
that can be a kind of critical

00:13:37.532 --> 00:13:39.330
handle on it.
 

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.524
Or at least you can show this
is the way how it can be

00:13:42.524 --> 00:13:45.331
criticized,
and you can show why you

00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:49.335
actually think that
methodological collectivism is

00:13:49.335 --> 00:13:50.480
reasonable.
 

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.144
Okay, the sixth question,
organic and mechanical

00:13:55.144 --> 00:14:00.799
solidarity, and how this is
related to Weber's typology of

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.190
authority.
 

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.120
I mean, it's pretty simple.
 

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.970
There are very important
distinctions--di

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.820
fferences--between Durkheim and
Weber.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.440
Durkheim looks at what brings
society together.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.460
The central concept is
solidarity.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:27.080
Weber looks at social conflict,
what takes society apart.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.654
So he looks at struggle around
power.

00:14:30.654 --> 00:14:31.450
Right?
 

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:37.000
Weber is coming from the
lineage of, I would say,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.428
Hobbes and Nietzsche.
 

00:14:39.428 --> 00:14:40.470
Right?
 

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:45.110
That's where the Weberian view
comes from.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:49.519
There are, of course,
similarities.

00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:54.833
Organic solidarity is what
legal-rational authority is for

00:14:54.833 --> 00:14:55.580
Weber.
 

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.340
They try to capture modernity.
 

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.995
Both are similar in the sense
that they are also social

00:15:03.995 --> 00:15:09.022
typologies of societies,
but also types of social

00:15:09.022 --> 00:15:14.049
organizations in any given
society, as such.

00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:16.600
So these are some similarities.
 

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:22.850
Okay, I think that's probably
about it.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:27.408
Well the question of anomie.
 

00:15:27.408 --> 00:15:32.908
I think we covered this
recently.

00:15:32.908 --> 00:15:36.710
So I don't have to refresh your
memory as much.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:41.735
The notion of anomie in
Durkheim comes out of the

00:15:41.735 --> 00:15:45.399
absence of sufficient
regulation.

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:50.847
And this is a temporary product
which emerges because mechanical

00:15:50.847 --> 00:15:56.210
solidarity is breaking down and
organic solidarity has not been

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.940
established yet.
 

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.750
And in the transition from
mechanical solidarity--

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.778
traditional society--into a
modern urban industrial society,

00:16:05.778 --> 00:16:09.799
people have a problem of
regulation in value systems,

00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:11.960
and that's when they are anomic.
 

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.690
But this will go away.
 

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:18.320
What is the theory of human
nature behind this?

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.889
This can be debated.
 

00:16:19.889 --> 00:16:27.278
One possible argument is that
since he believes that order has

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:32.976
to come from the outside,
from above, he tends to believe

00:16:32.976 --> 00:16:37.683
that without order,
created by a societal level,

00:16:37.683 --> 00:16:43.559
collective conscience,
we would do evil things.

00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:47.860
We need to be regulated. Right?
 

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.078
Well of course he knows that we
can be overregulated,

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:55.000
and then that's also
pathological.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.932
But the main pathology,
at least in the transition from

00:16:59.932 --> 00:17:03.220
mechanical to organic
solidarity,

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:10.099
is the absence of regulation
and the problem that humans may

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:15.720
do abnormal,
pathological, or evil acts.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:27.250
So there is a notion of humans
needing control over them.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:33.578
Well this speaks to the eighth
question: anomie and alienation.

00:17:33.578 --> 00:17:37.351
They are in many ways the
opposite to each other.

00:17:37.351 --> 00:17:37.980
Right?
 

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.348
Alienation means that you are
over-regulated.

00:17:40.348 --> 00:17:46.309
You are not in control of your
own life, of your own fate.

00:17:46.309 --> 00:17:50.130
That is what alienation means.
 

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:55.288
Also Marx is inspired by
Rousseau.

00:17:55.288 --> 00:17:58.929
It's a kind of Rousseauian
conception of nature behind

00:17:58.929 --> 00:17:59.410
that.
 

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.695
The problem comes from society;
it doesn't come from the

00:18:03.695 --> 00:18:04.364
individual.
 

00:18:04.364 --> 00:18:04.848
Right?
 

00:18:04.848 --> 00:18:11.509
We are born in society,
we are social by nature,

00:18:11.509 --> 00:18:17.118
and if modernity,
modern capitalism,

00:18:17.118 --> 00:18:20.960
would be removed,
we again would act socially and

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.278
collectively in a good way.
 

00:18:23.278 --> 00:18:28.122
So that's--and in contrast,
like Durkheim's notion is that

00:18:28.122 --> 00:18:33.220
the absence of regulation,
that's what causes pathologies.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.069
All right?
 

00:18:36.069 --> 00:18:37.608
Ninth question.
 

00:18:37.608 --> 00:18:41.978
This is something what I think
you find difficulties to deal

00:18:41.978 --> 00:18:46.568
with, because you did not find
the word 'disenchantment' in any

00:18:46.568 --> 00:18:48.048
of the readings.
 

00:18:48.048 --> 00:18:52.578
And indeed Weber did not use
the word very often.

00:18:52.578 --> 00:18:57.488
He did use it most critically
in an essay what he wrote after

00:18:57.488 --> 00:19:02.558
he was trying to combine his
various sociology of religions.

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:10.015
But the word 'enchantment' is
translated from the German word

00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:11.009
magic.
 

00:19:11.009 --> 00:19:17.423
So disenchantment means a
situation in which the world

00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:23.108
loses magic, when magic is moved
out of life.

00:19:23.108 --> 00:19:26.914
And this is happening with
rationalization.

00:19:26.914 --> 00:19:27.640
Right?
 

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.563
The big process of historical
evolution is towards

00:19:30.563 --> 00:19:32.950
rationalization and the loss of
magic.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:36.272
And the text what you have to
support that is in The

00:19:36.272 --> 00:19:39.288
Protestant Ethic,
where Weber makes a big deal

00:19:39.288 --> 00:19:40.150
out of it.
 

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.092
That's what especially
Calvinism and the teaching of

00:19:44.092 --> 00:19:47.105
predestination did,
it got rid of magic.

00:19:47.105 --> 00:19:47.880
Right?
 

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.965
But though he is,
say, a rationalist,

00:19:51.965 --> 00:19:56.279
he sees the downside of
rationalism;

00:19:56.279 --> 00:20:00.221
the loss of magic is the price
what we have to pay for

00:20:00.221 --> 00:20:01.558
rationalization.
 

00:20:01.558 --> 00:20:06.134
And he's a bit nostalgic about
the world, when it was magic,

00:20:06.134 --> 00:20:08.769
when the relations were
magical.

00:20:08.769 --> 00:20:20.460
So that is kind of a permanent
condition of modernity;

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.470
things are not getting any
better.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:26.790
That's, I think,
one of the big differences with

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.548
Durkheim's notion of anomie.
 

00:20:29.548 --> 00:20:38.750
The loss of magic actually does
mean, like--there is roots in

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.588
Marx here.
 

00:20:40.588 --> 00:20:46.996
Because the loss of magic means
that actually you seem to be

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.602
more vulnerable to fate.
 

00:20:49.602 --> 00:20:50.578
Right?
 

00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:55.144
Magic, you were a magician,
you had ways how to make God,

00:20:55.144 --> 00:20:58.650
the omnipotent God,
to do things for you;

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.324
for instance,
to save you.

00:21:01.324 --> 00:21:02.180
Right?
 

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.759
You could do it through magical
means.

00:21:04.759 --> 00:21:09.329
In a rationalized world,
we are less in control of our

00:21:09.329 --> 00:21:10.019
lives.
 

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:13.738
So in this sense I think
Weber's notion of disenchantment

00:21:13.738 --> 00:21:16.726
is closer to the Marxian notion
of alienation,

00:21:16.726 --> 00:21:19.980
rather than the Durkheimian
notion of anomie.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.368
Well social causes of suicide.
 

00:21:23.368 --> 00:21:31.009
Well we just covered this the
last lecture.

00:21:31.009 --> 00:21:36.798
The argument is--right?--that
we believe that suicide is the

00:21:36.798 --> 00:21:40.430
most individual,
intimate decision.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.952
He actually does show,
and demonstrate,

00:21:42.952 --> 00:21:45.875
this is not the case,
because there are great

00:21:45.875 --> 00:21:49.130
differences in suicide rate
across countries.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.900
These differences tend to be
very stable.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.596
There are also strong
relationships between suicide

00:21:55.596 --> 00:21:58.960
and religion,
and suicide and education,

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.267
and therefore there are--
right?--social determinants of

00:22:03.267 --> 00:22:05.750
this very individualistic
action,

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.180
as suicide.
 

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:12.590
Well there are these two
dimensions in which you can

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:17.087
conceptualize suicide:
how well integrated you are or

00:22:17.087 --> 00:22:19.769
how well regulated you are.
 

00:22:19.769 --> 00:22:23.880
And Durkheim has this idea that
too much integration and too

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.944
much regulation,
or too little integration or

00:22:26.944 --> 00:22:30.078
too little regulation,
are both abnormal.

00:22:30.078 --> 00:22:33.307
He's for the golden middle
road.

00:22:33.307 --> 00:22:34.140
Right?
 

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:39.108
Normality is in the middle road.
 

00:22:39.108 --> 00:22:44.763
Sort of an anomic suicide
happens when you are not

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:47.650
sufficiently regulated.
 

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:52.699
Egoistic suicide occurs when
you are not sufficiently

00:22:52.699 --> 00:22:55.029
integrated in society.
 

00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:58.358
That's when you egoistically
commit suicide,

00:22:58.358 --> 00:23:01.440
because you don't care how
yourself,

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.568
killing yourself,
will affect your beloved ones--

00:23:04.568 --> 00:23:08.118
right?--because you don't have
beloved ones.

00:23:08.118 --> 00:23:08.778
Right?
 

00:23:08.778 --> 00:23:11.346
You are not integrated in
society.

00:23:11.346 --> 00:23:11.970
Right?
 

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:16.260
You do not commit egoistic
suicide when you care about the

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.272
beloved ones,
and you don't want to cause

00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:21.530
them pain by killing yourself.
 

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:22.358
Right?
 

00:23:22.358 --> 00:23:27.522
Anomic suicide happens if
people are kind of not

00:23:27.522 --> 00:23:32.136
sufficiently regulated,
and therefore they,

00:23:32.136 --> 00:23:37.519
in this anomic situation,
may commit suicide.

00:23:37.519 --> 00:23:40.769
Okay, so that's about it.
 

00:23:40.769 --> 00:23:47.180
And let me then move on to
Durkheim's methodology.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:24:16.210
&gt;
 

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:19.650
Yes, number twenty-four.
 

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:25.880
So this is The Rules
of Sociological Method,

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.349
published in 1895,
two years after The Division

00:24:30.349 --> 00:24:35.460
of Labor and two years
before the Suicide,

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:40.598
but foreshadows and combines
elements from both.

00:24:40.598 --> 00:24:43.519
I have a lot of stuff,
so I will rush you through.

00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:49.578
One question is--what he deals
with--when is a fact social;

00:24:49.578 --> 00:24:51.920
when can we talk about social
facts?

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.318
Then he asks how can we observe
social facts?

00:24:55.318 --> 00:24:59.527
Then he makes a distinction
between normal and pathological

00:24:59.527 --> 00:25:00.180
states.
 

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:05.691
He also writes about nominalism
and realism, and offers an

00:25:05.691 --> 00:25:11.395
alternative to nominalism and
realism, what is his system of

00:25:11.395 --> 00:25:13.328
classifications.
 

00:25:13.328 --> 00:25:19.151
And then he addresses the issue
of the question of explanation

00:25:19.151 --> 00:25:24.400
and causality--very path
breaking ideas in his times.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.608
So when is a fact social?
 

00:25:28.608 --> 00:25:32.965
And the first point is,
well we have to make a

00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:38.483
distinction between social and
biological or psychological

00:25:38.483 --> 00:25:39.838
phenomena.
 

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:46.900
Well, and then he also--I will
elaborate on this.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:52.461
And then he asks the question,
how objective are the social

00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:53.230
facts?
 

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:57.450
The biological facts are
obviously objective;

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:02.720
psychological, not so obviously;
the social, the least so.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.048
Why are they still objective?
 

00:26:05.048 --> 00:26:10.515
And then he labors on what
makes the social facts

00:26:10.515 --> 00:26:13.019
collective, as such.
 

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:15.846
And that is--of course,
education is the major

00:26:15.846 --> 00:26:16.598
mechanism.
 

00:26:16.598 --> 00:26:21.862
Okay, so let's ask the
question, what is the social

00:26:21.862 --> 00:26:27.440
fact, as distinct from
biological or psychological?

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.970
Well he said,
"Well, if all facts,

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:38.730
what affects human beings,
would be regarded as social,

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:43.243
there would be no real
discipline what should be called

00:26:43.243 --> 00:26:44.750
sociology."
 

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.356
And as I pointed out
before--right?--he is the first

00:26:48.356 --> 00:26:52.106
person who identifies
emphatically with the discipline

00:26:52.106 --> 00:26:53.308
of sociology.
 

00:26:53.308 --> 00:26:59.181
He actually has this notion of
life sciences,

00:26:59.181 --> 00:27:02.250
interestingly,
right?

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.711
And sociology is part of life
sciences.

00:27:05.711 --> 00:27:06.440
Right?
 

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.307
There are three life sciences:
sociology, biology,

00:27:10.307 --> 00:27:11.650
and psychology.
 

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:17.001
But these three different life
sciences deal with different

00:27:17.001 --> 00:27:21.247
units of analysis,
deal with different objects.

00:27:21.247 --> 00:27:22.170
Right?
 

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:27.064
Biology deals with the body,
psychology deals with the

00:27:27.064 --> 00:27:31.275
personality,
while sociology deals--this is

00:27:31.275 --> 00:27:35.372
his shtick,
right?--it deals with

00:27:35.372 --> 00:27:39.065
collective representations.
 

00:27:39.065 --> 00:27:40.160
Right?
 

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.132
He tries to move beyond the
idea of collective

00:27:43.132 --> 00:27:46.436
consciousness;
collective representation,

00:27:46.436 --> 00:27:50.327
which somehow objectively
embodies, as a fact,

00:27:50.327 --> 00:27:53.960
the states of collective
consciousness.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:59.852
And therefore he said,
"This is indeed a set of

00:27:59.852 --> 00:28:06.670
phenomena I will be able to
distinguish with other facts.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.339
So when do I act socially?"
 

00:28:09.339 --> 00:28:11.019
he asks the question.
 

00:28:11.019 --> 00:28:15.671
"I do so when I execute my
contract."

00:28:15.671 --> 00:28:16.480
Right?
 

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.269
"I perform
duties--right?--which are

00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:22.636
defined externally to me.
 

00:28:22.636 --> 00:28:23.490
Right?
 

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.740
If I perform my duties,
then I am acting socially;

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.788
I'm a socially responsible
person".

00:28:30.788 --> 00:28:33.768
Which seems to
be--right?--straightforward and

00:28:33.768 --> 00:28:34.430
obvious.
 

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.769
Okay, how objective they are?
 

00:28:37.769 --> 00:28:42.119
That's very--at first look it
doesn't look too objective,

00:28:42.119 --> 00:28:46.702
because the sense of obligation
seems to be very subjective.

00:28:46.702 --> 00:28:47.480
Right?
 

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.872
You may occasionally say to
your partner,

00:28:50.872 --> 00:28:53.671
"You are
irresponsible."

00:28:53.671 --> 00:28:54.519
Right?
 

00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:59.780
By which you mean you don't
have enough of a feeling of a

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.284
duty towards me.
 

00:29:01.284 --> 00:29:02.130
Right?
 

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:08.640
So there is this subjective
element involved in this.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.578
But he said nevertheless we can
see this is still objective.

00:29:13.578 --> 00:29:18.730
And one of the major ways how
we can understand it is

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:23.605
objective,
that in fact there is some

00:29:23.605 --> 00:29:28.771
external enforcement--
right?--of these obligations,

00:29:28.771 --> 00:29:31.588
if you keep breaking these
obligations,

00:29:31.588 --> 00:29:34.544
there will be penalties against
you.

00:29:34.544 --> 00:29:35.220
Right?
 

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.970
Well not all the time.
 

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.858
Occasionally you can get away
with it.

00:29:38.858 --> 00:29:42.088
But at one point there may be
punishment.

00:29:42.088 --> 00:29:46.272
You see others being punished
by not fulfilling their duties

00:29:46.272 --> 00:29:50.958
or obligations,
and therefore you can see that

00:29:50.958 --> 00:29:56.115
it is externally enforced--
it's not just a subjective

00:29:56.115 --> 00:29:59.078
thing that you think you have
duties,

00:29:59.078 --> 00:30:03.288
right?--it will be externally
implemented.

00:30:03.288 --> 00:30:08.023
So well you have
obligations--right?--at 7:00

00:30:08.023 --> 00:30:08.670
p.m.
 

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:15.142
today to go on the internet and
unload questions--right?--and to

00:30:15.142 --> 00:30:17.298
answer two of them.
 

00:30:17.298 --> 00:30:23.736
Well this, of course,
will come as subjective

00:30:23.736 --> 00:30:27.538
feelings of duty in you.
 

00:30:27.538 --> 00:30:31.515
It's--have enough guilt
feelings if you don't do it in a

00:30:31.515 --> 00:30:34.404
timely manner,
if you would be late--it's

00:30:34.404 --> 00:30:37.078
sufficiently internalized in
you.

00:30:37.078 --> 00:30:42.973
But you know that there were
occasions when people were late

00:30:42.973 --> 00:30:48.170
with assignments and there were
teaching fellows,

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.859
or professors,
who deducted--right?--

00:30:50.859 --> 00:30:53.509
something from the grades.
 

00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:55.950
So therefore you don't want to
risk a lower grade.

00:30:55.950 --> 00:31:00.352
And beyond your deep personal
commitment that I want to

00:31:00.352 --> 00:31:03.450
fulfill my duty in a timely
manner--

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:07.849
right?--there is also a concern
that if I don't,

00:31:07.849 --> 00:31:11.019
I may get some penalty. Right?
 

00:31:11.019 --> 00:31:13.361
So that's what makes it social.
 

00:31:13.361 --> 00:31:13.890
Right?
 

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:20.500
Okay, so well it has to be
collective.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.930
Right?
 

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.750
It cannot be just individual.
 

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:30.799
We have a collective sense of
obligations, and he uses the

00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:32.779
term 'habits'.
 

00:31:32.779 --> 00:31:39.093
It's a very good term,
which I don't think has been

00:31:39.093 --> 00:31:45.279
used before him so forcefully as
Durkheim did--

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:52.516
became very widely used more
recently following another great

00:31:52.516 --> 00:31:56.593
French sociologist,
Pierre Bourdieu,

00:31:56.593 --> 00:32:01.308
who termed this term habit into
a term habitus.

00:32:01.308 --> 00:32:02.108
Right?
 

00:32:02.108 --> 00:32:06.790
Well habit, habitus,
mores, manners,

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:13.880
ways of life--right?--means
that we have something;

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:19.555
we know how to navigate in
social life.

00:32:19.555 --> 00:32:20.750
Right?
 

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.598
We know how to deal with
situations.

00:32:22.598 --> 00:32:25.868
These are habits,
the ways how we behave in

00:32:25.868 --> 00:32:26.960
social life.
 

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.118
And he said,
"Where does it come

00:32:29.118 --> 00:32:29.900
from?"
 

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.752
He said this is coming from
education.

00:32:32.752 --> 00:32:33.368
Right?
 

00:32:33.368 --> 00:32:39.078
It's you are being educated
what you are supposed to do.

00:32:39.078 --> 00:32:44.121
Well that's not
exactly--right?--what Hobbes

00:32:44.121 --> 00:32:45.058
meant.
 

00:32:45.058 --> 00:32:47.519
Hobbes had this
idea--right?--of manners and

00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:50.513
customs,
but he believed that these

00:32:50.513 --> 00:32:55.153
manners and customs simply he
could explain from the

00:32:55.153 --> 00:32:56.789
individual actors.
 

00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:57.700
Right?
 

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:02.050
The individuals act and then
they know that there will be

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:05.470
another, an Alter who
will respond.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:11.220
They evaluate what the possible
answer of the other will be,

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:15.480
and therefore they will learn
ways how to navigate,

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.567
anticipating possible
punishment from others.

00:33:18.567 --> 00:33:19.130
Right?
 

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.464
So he, Hobbes,
can do it by doing a

00:33:22.464 --> 00:33:26.390
methodological individualist
exercise.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:30.383
Durkheim emphasizes no,
this is not how we learn it,

00:33:30.383 --> 00:33:34.612
through acting and getting
punishment and seeing others

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:36.098
being punished.
 

00:33:36.098 --> 00:33:38.368
It is through the system of
education.

00:33:38.368 --> 00:33:41.430
Now this is a good point,
an interesting point.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:46.962
Well and here
again--right?--this is kind of

00:33:46.962 --> 00:33:51.210
crystallized in ways of acting.
 

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:56.164
That's what habit,
or in the more contemporary

00:33:56.164 --> 00:33:59.357
version habitus,
is all about.

00:33:59.357 --> 00:34:00.460
Right?
 

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.756
I think Bourdieu also means
that habitus is something what

00:34:03.756 --> 00:34:09.130
you learn and carry in yourself,
and depending what your habits

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:13.235
or habitus are,
will mean how you will fit in

00:34:13.235 --> 00:34:14.909
different situations.
 

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:19.842
We occasionally think that
people get into positions where

00:34:19.842 --> 00:34:24.429
they don't have the appropriate
habitus to behave--

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:28.708
right?--and therefore they may
not be performing a task very

00:34:28.708 --> 00:34:30.507
well,
because they do not have the

00:34:30.507 --> 00:34:31.159
proper habits.
 

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:34.460
The habits are kind of
internalized earlier in life,

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.670
and then it helps us to perform
different functions in society.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:41.679
Well I have to rush.
 

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.349
So how do we observe social
facts?

00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:46.510
And now here it comes.
 

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:51.998
These social facts are things,
and what we need is a rigorous

00:34:51.998 --> 00:34:55.840
discipline--right?--for social
analysis.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.851
And that also implies that we
have to get rid of all of our

00:35:00.851 --> 00:35:02.320
preconceptions.
 

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.550
We have to define the objects
of our investigations

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:09.260
independently from our values.
 

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.829
It's almost a value-free
science, what he argues;

00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:15.300
I will say not quite.
 

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:20.085
And we have to get rid of those
data which are too

00:35:20.085 --> 00:35:25.460
subjective--sort of social facts
are things, objects.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.849
Well this is a very interesting
citation,

00:35:29.849 --> 00:35:32.090
what you would not expect from
Durkheim,

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:37.072
to come, and reads almost like
Karl Marx in The German

00:35:37.072 --> 00:35:38.228
Ideology.
 

00:35:38.228 --> 00:35:39.030
Right?
 

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:43.498
"The proper science should
not proceed from ideas to

00:35:43.498 --> 00:35:47.329
things, but from things to
ideas." Right?

00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:50.980
It reads almost identical to
The German Ideology.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.230
But he, of course,
means something different.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.639
Right?
 

00:35:53.639 --> 00:35:56.550
The things are not property
relations.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.179
Right?
 

00:35:57.179 --> 00:36:01.335
The things are actually
collective manifestations--

00:36:01.335 --> 00:36:03.579
right?--collective ideas.
 

00:36:03.579 --> 00:36:09.753
So the notion of thing is used
here in a very unique and very

00:36:09.753 --> 00:36:11.400
different way.
 

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.126
But what he
emphasizes--right?--that they

00:36:14.126 --> 00:36:18.043
are not the individual ideas,
but they are kind of

00:36:18.043 --> 00:36:21.079
crystallized,
and it's out there,

00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:27.000
over us, like things what we
cannot change,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.250
individuals cannot really
change.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:35.650
And he said well social
sciences evolve,

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:41.300
just like natural sciences,
by getting rid of prejudices--

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:47.250
right?--dogmas,
to moving beyond dogmas,

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:51.420
and substitute them with the
study of facts.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.583
That's what Bacon,
the philosopher--right?--in the

00:36:54.583 --> 00:36:59.068
seventeenth century suggested;
all scientific investigation

00:36:59.068 --> 00:37:03.387
should start from induction,
from the observance of

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:05.980
sensually observable facts.
 

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.704
So he invokes
Bacon--right?--that this is the

00:37:09.704 --> 00:37:11.228
scientific method.
 

00:37:11.228 --> 00:37:11.989
Right?
 

00:37:11.989 --> 00:37:16.409
Well it is not necessarily
sensuous experience,

00:37:16.409 --> 00:37:21.117
which is emphasized in
Durkheim, but moving beyond

00:37:21.117 --> 00:37:24.000
preconceptions and dogmas.
 

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.248
And he said,
"Well the theory should be

00:37:27.248 --> 00:37:31.630
only introduced when science is
sufficiently at an advanced

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.840
stage."
 

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:38.094
Well this is a very good advice
to people who are graduate

00:37:38.094 --> 00:37:41.690
students and are doing
dissertations.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.233
Don't start with
theory--right?--start by

00:37:44.233 --> 00:37:47.478
analyzing social facts,
and when you're sufficiently

00:37:47.478 --> 00:37:50.849
advanced, that's when you find
the proper theory.

00:37:50.849 --> 00:37:54.114
When you will be doing your
senior thesis,

00:37:54.114 --> 00:37:56.663
I think it's good advice to
take.

00:37:56.663 --> 00:37:57.460
Right?
 

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:05.039
Don't start with big words,
start with actual analysis and

00:38:05.039 --> 00:38:12.219
find theory when you already
have a scientific idea.

00:38:12.219 --> 00:38:16.916
And here he comes,
a strong critique of economists

00:38:16.916 --> 00:38:19.847
of his time;
a critique what some people

00:38:19.847 --> 00:38:22.320
will say would apply to
economists today.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.552
He said, "Economists today
principally are occupied how the

00:38:27.552 --> 00:38:31.918
economy ought to work,
rather than to understanding

00:38:31.918 --> 00:38:35.599
how the economy actually
works." Right?

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:39.336
Paul Krugman just published a
little piece in New York

00:38:39.336 --> 00:38:43.340
Times a couple of weeks ago
where he actually accused his

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.610
own colleagues.
 

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.690
He said, "You created this
mess"--

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.039
you know, with the financial
markets--

00:38:49.039 --> 00:38:52.615
"because you were never
looking at how the economy

00:38:52.615 --> 00:38:53.610
really works.
 

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:56.730
You operated how the economy
should be working.

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:59.264
But we really should be
studying how the economy

00:38:59.264 --> 00:39:00.018
works."
 

00:39:00.018 --> 00:39:04.722
So it's an interesting
criticism of economics--I mean,

00:39:04.722 --> 00:39:08.449
not necessarily true for all
economists.

00:39:08.449 --> 00:39:11.844
And it can be debated whether a
normative science,

00:39:11.844 --> 00:39:14.893
which describes how something
should operate,

00:39:14.893 --> 00:39:16.280
is illegitimate.
 

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:22.039
But he certainly takes the idea
that it should not be normative.

00:39:22.039 --> 00:39:25.161
Well we have to get rid of
preconceptions.

00:39:25.161 --> 00:39:25.768
Right?
 

00:39:25.768 --> 00:39:29.373
And he said Descartes and Bacon
disagreed with each other.

00:39:29.373 --> 00:39:29.880
Right?
 

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:35.333
As I said, Bacon was the one
who said the analysis should

00:39:35.333 --> 00:39:43.869
start from induction,
observing phenomena what we can

00:39:43.869 --> 00:39:49.155
sensuously study,
and then move towards

00:39:49.155 --> 00:39:50.639
theorizing later on.
 

00:39:50.639 --> 00:39:54.949
Descartes was opting for a
deductive method.

00:39:54.949 --> 00:39:59.855
He said, "Well we have to
start from general abstractions

00:39:59.855 --> 00:40:04.760
and then to move to derived
hypotheses from these general,

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.420
and then to move to the
facts."

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.750
This is the difference between
Bacon and Descartes.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.755
But he said,
"But they do agree in one

00:40:12.755 --> 00:40:15.581
thing,
namely that no matter whether

00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:19.467
your reasoning is inductive--
right?--from observation to

00:40:19.467 --> 00:40:20.817
theory,
or deductive,

00:40:20.817 --> 00:40:24.668
from theory to observation,
they agree that we should get

00:40:24.668 --> 00:40:28.539
rid of the dogmas;
no preconceptions."

00:40:28.539 --> 00:40:32.250
And he said this is
particularly difficult in social

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:36.179
sciences because we think we
know how society works.

00:40:36.179 --> 00:40:40.166
We don't necessarily think we
need social scientists to tell

00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:41.719
us how society works.
 

00:40:41.719 --> 00:40:44.222
We experience society,
and therefore we have an idea

00:40:44.222 --> 00:40:44.960
how it works.
 

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.239
And we have a strong interest
how we would want society to

00:40:49.239 --> 00:40:52.128
work,
and if the conception,

00:40:52.128 --> 00:40:55.650
if the findings,
goes against our interest or

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.586
beliefs,
strong sentiments,

00:40:57.586 --> 00:40:59.460
we tend to disregard it.
 

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.596
So it's very difficult to get
rid of dogmas in social

00:41:02.596 --> 00:41:05.735
sciences,
because we have an ordinary

00:41:05.735 --> 00:41:08.518
knowledge--
right?--not scientific but

00:41:08.518 --> 00:41:11.838
ordinary knowledge--
how society and the economy

00:41:11.838 --> 00:41:15.204
operates--
right?--and we have an interest

00:41:15.204 --> 00:41:16.699
as well involved.
 

00:41:16.699 --> 00:41:19.159
So very difficult to get rid of
our preconceptions.

00:41:19.159 --> 00:41:21.429
Well he said,
"Well yes,

00:41:21.429 --> 00:41:26.130
because we have very strong
sentiments--and that's okay--we

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:29.210
should study the
sentiments."

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:33.480
Sentiments should study as if
they were objects.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:37.304
But we should not be led by
sentiments.

00:41:37.304 --> 00:41:38.110
Right?
 

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:48.659
We have to proceed without
passion and without prejudices.

00:41:48.659 --> 00:41:53.878
Well we have to define the
objects of our investigation

00:41:53.878 --> 00:41:57.840
independently from our values,
as such.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:03.121
And therefore he said we have
to come up with objective

00:42:03.121 --> 00:42:06.840
definitions of what we are
studying.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.710
He said, "What is a
crime?"

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:12.192
He said, "Crimes are
social acts which are

00:42:12.192 --> 00:42:13.480
punished."
 

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.460
Therefore I don't have to make
a value judgment in defining

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.010
crime.
 

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:22.195
If I see a society in which
certain acts are systematically

00:42:22.195 --> 00:42:26.163
punished by that society,
I can say in this society this

00:42:26.163 --> 00:42:28.039
is defined as a crime.
 

00:42:28.039 --> 00:42:30.050
I may disagree with this.
 

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:34.027
I may say this should not be a
crime, but in this society it is

00:42:34.027 --> 00:42:34.670
a crime.
 

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.306
In many societies,
for instance,

00:42:37.306 --> 00:42:40.880
homosexual acts were defined as
a crime.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.070
In those societies,
they were a crime.

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.063
You can disagree with it,
and you should say,

00:42:47.063 --> 00:42:51.079
"Well, homosexuality
should be decriminalized";

00:42:51.079 --> 00:42:53.750
as it was, fortunately,
decriminalized.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.800
It's not a crime any longer.
 

00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:01.242
Well smoking and selling
marijuana is a crime.

00:43:01.242 --> 00:43:02.210
Right?
 

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:04.610
It is being punished;
you can end up in jail.

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.219
That's a fact.
 

00:43:06.219 --> 00:43:09.809
You may think that marijuana
should be decriminalized,

00:43:09.809 --> 00:43:13.260
but the fact that the
consumption of marijuana and

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:17.418
marketing of marijuana is a
crime today in the United States

00:43:17.418 --> 00:43:21.702
is an objective fact--
right?--and it can be studied

00:43:21.702 --> 00:43:26.436
by looking at the law and what
on earth judges do in this

00:43:26.436 --> 00:43:27.114
country.
 

00:43:27.114 --> 00:43:27.960
Right?
 

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.239
So that's his point.
 

00:43:31.239 --> 00:43:35.313
It doesn't matter what your
values are, what matters what

00:43:35.313 --> 00:43:37.570
the practices of society are.
 

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:39.400
The same goes for morality.
 

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.804
He said, "Well some people
will say well they are immoral

00:43:42.804 --> 00:43:45.429
because they act differently
than I do."

00:43:45.429 --> 00:43:47.920
He said, "No,
every society has morality.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.927
You have to understand what
that morality is,

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:52.440
even if it is different from
your own morality."

00:43:52.440 --> 00:44:00.429
Well we have to disregard too
subjective informations.

00:44:00.429 --> 00:44:05.362
This is what scientists do when
they use measures and

00:44:05.362 --> 00:44:06.690
instruments.
 

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:11.289
That's what--he's very much
attracted to the scientific

00:44:11.289 --> 00:44:16.099
reasoning in sociology;
it's a very French idea.

00:44:16.099 --> 00:44:18.800
Well then he makes a
distinction between normal and

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.610
pathological.
 

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.239
So what is the difference
between normal and pathological?

00:44:23.239 --> 00:44:25.420
Well he said,
"Normal is the most

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.188
frequent form of action."
 

00:44:27.188 --> 00:44:27.719
Right?
 

00:44:27.719 --> 00:44:32.809
We need a conception for
normality, because we just

00:44:32.809 --> 00:44:37.289
cannot operate without defining
normality.

00:44:37.289 --> 00:44:41.280
But how can we do that,
and at the same time remain

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.911
objective, when we can say
something is abnormal without us

00:44:45.911 --> 00:44:47.030
making it?
 

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:50.570
He said it's easy,
because what we shall do,

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:56.351
that we should regard those as
normal which is sort of the most

00:44:56.351 --> 00:45:02.309
common way of act,
and to define the extremes as

00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:03.690
abnormal.
 

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:07.355
And he said the reason for this
is that it would be

00:45:07.355 --> 00:45:11.606
incomprehensible if the most
widespread act were not at the

00:45:11.606 --> 00:45:14.539
same time the most advantageous
one.

00:45:14.539 --> 00:45:16.369
But then he takes it back.
 

00:45:16.369 --> 00:45:22.005
He said well we can actually
see a number of occasions when

00:45:22.005 --> 00:45:26.766
frequently behavior,
which is frequently followed,

00:45:26.766 --> 00:45:29.389
is actually not useful.
 

00:45:29.389 --> 00:45:34.036
In this case,
it may be inherited from the

00:45:34.036 --> 00:45:34.829
past.
 

00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:37.619
It may have been functional at
one point of time.

00:45:37.619 --> 00:45:42.030
The situation changed and
people still keep their habit,

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:44.159
and they still keep behaving
that way,

00:45:44.159 --> 00:45:47.969
and that can be now defined as
abnormal,

00:45:47.969 --> 00:45:51.552
though it can be probably quite
average behavior.

00:45:51.552 --> 00:45:52.150
Right?
 

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:54.603
Think of racism,
for instance,

00:45:54.603 --> 00:45:56.128
as a good example.
 

00:45:56.128 --> 00:45:56.889
Right?
 

00:45:56.889 --> 00:46:03.755
Well there is a very
interesting argument about

00:46:03.755 --> 00:46:04.949
crime.
 

00:46:04.949 --> 00:46:08.940
He said well crime looks like
it is indeed,

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.789
by definition,
pathological.

00:46:11.789 --> 00:46:13.250
But is it?
 

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:15.599
He said well crime is present
in all societies.

00:46:15.599 --> 00:46:23.599
So when is--he makes this very
interesting argument.

00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:27.518
And therefore really,
I think, we are calling crime

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:31.440
abnormal if there are too much
crime in society.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:35.719
Crime per se is a normal state,
as such.

00:46:35.719 --> 00:46:40.181
Well I think I'll leave this
nominalism, realism argument

00:46:40.181 --> 00:46:40.659
out.
 

00:46:40.659 --> 00:46:48.639
We'll put it on the internet.
 

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:51.260
About causality--I'll finish
with the idea of causality.

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:56.110
He said well the task of social
sciences is to explain,

00:46:56.110 --> 00:47:01.052
not only to describe--to be
able to deal with causes and

00:47:01.052 --> 00:47:02.309
causality.
 

00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:05.559
And there are different methods
how to do causality.

00:47:05.559 --> 00:47:10.456
He said in social sciences the
typical method is comparative,

00:47:10.456 --> 00:47:12.659
rather than experimental.
 

00:47:12.659 --> 00:47:15.289
In natural sciences we do
experiments.

00:47:15.289 --> 00:47:17.219
In social sciences we can't.
 

00:47:17.219 --> 00:47:22.606
Experiment does assume that we
assign certain stimuli randomly

00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:26.139
to a population,
and then to see how they

00:47:26.139 --> 00:47:28.699
respond to this stimulus.
 

00:47:28.699 --> 00:47:31.139
We can't do that in society.
 

00:47:31.139 --> 00:47:36.351
And as I mentioned about
suicide, we cannot assign people

00:47:36.351 --> 00:47:41.750
to get married and others to
assign not to get married,

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:44.706
and to study later on what the
effect of marriage was in

00:47:44.706 --> 00:47:46.050
something like suicide.
 

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:50.030
So therefore what we can do is
the comparative method.

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:53.949
Well I think I'm out of time.
 

00:47:53.949 --> 00:47:56.885
He makes a distinction between
two types of comparative

00:47:56.885 --> 00:47:57.429
methods.
 

00:47:57.429 --> 00:48:06.949
The comparative methods can be
either the method of agreement;

00:48:06.949 --> 00:48:10.753
a method of agreement if I
compare two similar types of

00:48:10.753 --> 00:48:11.599
societies.
 

00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:13.769
For instance,
the United States and Canada,

00:48:13.769 --> 00:48:16.715
and to see whether there is a
difference between these two

00:48:16.715 --> 00:48:17.440
countries.
 

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.585
For instance,
the level--I have a theory that

00:48:21.585 --> 00:48:24.789
poverty may be related to crime.
 

00:48:24.789 --> 00:48:27.594
People who are hungry are more
likely to steal

00:48:27.594 --> 00:48:30.900
food--right?--because they have
to feed themselves;

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.340
to put it very simply.
 

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:36.137
Now I compare two societies by
the level of poverty is the

00:48:36.137 --> 00:48:39.137
same,
and then I will see whether it

00:48:39.137 --> 00:48:44.237
is indeed poor people are more
likely to commit certain type of

00:48:44.237 --> 00:48:45.059
crimes.
 

00:48:45.059 --> 00:48:48.510
Or I can do the method of
difference.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:51.092
And the method of difference,
if I compare two very different

00:48:51.092 --> 00:48:51.610
countries.
 

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:54.329
I compare the United States
with Bangladesh,

00:48:54.329 --> 00:48:56.929
where there is a very different
rate of crime--

00:48:56.929 --> 00:49:02.277
right?--and then I see whether
there is a difference in crime

00:49:02.277 --> 00:49:03.170
as such.
 

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:07.112
He said the problem with this
method is that there is not

00:49:07.112 --> 00:49:09.717
enough cases,
and therefore the proper

00:49:09.717 --> 00:49:13.380
method, interestingly he argues,
is correlation.

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:16.570
What we have to do is to find
what the correlations are

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:17.989
between two variables.
 

00:49:17.989 --> 00:49:22.780
Well this was guiding
contemporary social sciences.

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:27.514
But Durkheim was smarter than
most number crunchers in social

00:49:27.514 --> 00:49:32.487
sciences, because--here I think
the last sentence what I'll show

00:49:32.487 --> 00:49:33.829
is important.
 

00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:37.478
Well you have to make sure that
the relationship,

00:49:37.478 --> 00:49:41.429
what the causal relationship
shows, is really causal.

00:49:41.429 --> 00:49:42.190
Right?
 

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:45.731
"And therefore we shall
investigate, by the aid of

00:49:45.731 --> 00:49:49.472
deduction, how one of the two
terms has produced the other

00:49:49.472 --> 00:49:50.849
one." Right?
 

00:49:50.849 --> 00:49:55.260
Today we would say,
what Durkheim is suggesting,

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:58.119
if you want to establish real
causality,

00:49:58.119 --> 00:50:03.050
short of the possibility of an
experimental method,

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:07.030
you have to figure out what is
the causal mechanism,

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:10.130
what relates the two phenomena
together,

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:12.590
which are statistically
correlated to each other.

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:17.688
Statistical correlation does
not necessarily show that they

00:50:17.688 --> 00:50:20.590
are--one is causing the other
one.

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:21.469
Right?
 

00:50:21.469 --> 00:50:27.570
You have a theory that the
stork brings the baby,

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:31.746
and then you test this,
and you show that fertility in

00:50:31.746 --> 00:50:34.829
Scandinavia is low,
and there are not many storks.

00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:37.967
So you have a very strong
correlation between number of

00:50:37.967 --> 00:50:40.349
storks and number of babies
being born.

00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:44.465
This still does not show
that--right?--the storks bring

00:50:44.465 --> 00:50:45.304
the babies.
 

00:50:45.304 --> 00:50:45.989
Right?
 

00:50:45.989 --> 00:50:49.507
Therefore you have to look at
the causal mechanism how babies

00:50:49.507 --> 00:50:50.739
are being produced.
 

00:50:50.739 --> 00:50:53.882
That's basically,
I think, a very early,

00:50:53.882 --> 00:50:57.750
insightful argument by
Durkheim's methodology.

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:00.269
And that's about it.
 

00:51:00.269 --> 00:51:01.300
Thank you.
 

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.710
&gt;
 

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:06.630
Prof: Oh thank you.
 

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:08.739
Thanks.
 

00:51:08.739 --> 00:51:14.000

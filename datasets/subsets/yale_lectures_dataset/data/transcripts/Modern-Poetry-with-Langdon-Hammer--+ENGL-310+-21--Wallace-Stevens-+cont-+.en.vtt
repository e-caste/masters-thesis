00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.722
Professor Langdon
Hammer: Today,

00:00:03.722 --> 00:00:05.400
last Stevens lecture.
 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.796
Late Stevens,
Stevens after World War Two,

00:00:10.796 --> 00:00:18.430
in the late '40s and early
1950s at the end of his life.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.978
That's my subject,
really, the latest writing that

00:00:23.978 --> 00:00:28.734
we will have chronologically,
historically,

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:33.150
that we will have discussed so
far.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.450
One of the general themes of
what I had to say has been

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.816
modern poetry's role in a
secularizing culture:

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:50.883
how the general decay of
personal religious belief in

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:58.000
practice enters into the way in
which these poets imagine what

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.554
poetry is,
what it means for them,

00:01:02.554 --> 00:01:05.329
what they can do with it.
 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.393
"It is a habit with me to be
thinking of some substitute for

00:01:09.393 --> 00:01:12.010
religion," Stevens says in a
letter.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.900
"My trouble and the trouble of
a great many people is the loss

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.790
of belief in the sort of God in
whom we were all brought up to

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.562
believe."
Stevens, however,

00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:26.790
responds to this problem
vigorously.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.062
He tends to see it,
as I've been saying,

00:01:30.062 --> 00:01:31.739
as an opportunity.
 

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:37.890
Power and freedom that were
formerly assigned to God are

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.580
claimed for man,
for the human,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.938
for the poet in particular,
but the poet viewed in Stevens

00:01:46.938 --> 00:01:51.920
not as a kind of exemplary
individual but as a kind of

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.246
model of the human and of,
in fact, common properties and

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:01.950
powers within us.
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.481
In general, I would say that
the poet stands for a kind of

00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:11.410
general human capacity to create
the world in the act of seeing

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.196
and describing it,
very much as Marie was arguing

00:02:17.196 --> 00:02:22.954
last Wednesday.
Stevens, as I began by saying,

00:02:22.954 --> 00:02:27.159
is very much a poet of this
world.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.030
We are an "unhappy people in a
happy world."

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.071
The world is,
as "The Auroras of Autumn"

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:39.009
suggests, without malice towards
us.

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:43.174
Original sin,
what Stevens calls "the enigma

00:02:43.174 --> 00:02:49.082
of the guilty dream," this is a
kind of exhausted fiction that

00:02:49.082 --> 00:02:51.310
Stevens throws off.
 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.199
He lives in a world that's full
of sensual, seasonal pleasures

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.886
and perceptions,
including the primary pleasure

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:05.348
of perception itself;
the seasons providing at once a

00:03:05.348 --> 00:03:11.150
kind of "climate," to use his
word, a circumstance,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:19.466
as well as a symbol for this
way of being and knowing,

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:23.389
knowing our experience.
 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.630
The seasons are a kind of
answer, you could say,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.428
in Stevens, for traditional
myth, providing a kind of

00:03:34.428 --> 00:03:39.000
structure of recurrence and
recovery.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.500
Well, how does such a poet
imagine the end of life,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.580
of his life in particular?
 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.801
Can a vision of the world
that's so focused on happiness

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:55.840
really include death and loss?
 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:03.313
Can it really include in its
account of the world that is so

00:04:03.313 --> 00:04:08.000
right, can it really include
grief?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.173
Stevens wants not an
alternative to religion but,

00:04:12.173 --> 00:04:15.129
as he says, a substitute for
it;

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.517
in particular,
a substitute for the solutions

00:04:19.517 --> 00:04:22.110
religion gives to death.
 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.780
"Poetry is a means of
redemption," Stevens said in

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.639
that adage, and he meant it.
 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.459
But what exactly did he mean by
it?

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:38.687
We'll look at a number of poems
that suggest answers,

00:04:38.687 --> 00:04:42.279
beginning with,
on page 260,

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:49.779
a poem called "Large Red Man
Reading," a poem included

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:58.268
in--written after "The Auroras
of Autumn" but included in the

00:04:58.268 --> 00:05:05.060
volume called The Auroras of
Autumn:

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.899
 
 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:13.791
There were ghosts that
returned to earth to hear his

00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:17.870
phrases,
As he sat there reading,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.029
aloud, the great blue tabulae.
 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:27.031
They were those from the
wilderness of stars that had

00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:32.165
expected more.
[Those that have come to hear

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.908
him read.]
There were those that returned

00:05:35.908 --> 00:05:39.079
to hear him read from the poem
of life,

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:43.911
Of the pans above the stove,
the pots on the table,

00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:46.230
the tulips among them.
 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.003
[Another sort of domestic
still-life, a little like that

00:05:51.003 --> 00:05:56.175
in "Poems of our Climate."]
They were those that would have

00:05:56.175 --> 00:05:59.259
wept to step barefoot into
reality.

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.704
They would have wept and been
happy, have shivered in the

00:06:03.704 --> 00:06:06.967
frost
And cried out to feel it again,

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:11.621
have run fingers over leaves
And against the most coiled

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.449
thorn, have seized on what was
ugly

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.758
And laughed,
as he sat there reading,

00:06:17.758 --> 00:06:24.830
from out of the purple tabulae
[now the tabulae have gotten

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:31.470
redder; they were blue,
now they're purple],

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.323
The outlines of being and its
expressings, the syllables of

00:06:36.323 --> 00:06:39.443
its law:
Poesis, poesis,

00:06:39.443 --> 00:06:43.699
the literal characters,
the vatic lines,

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:51.103
Which in those ears and in
those thin, those spended

00:06:51.103 --> 00:06:53.921
hearts,
Took on color,

00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:59.209
took on shape and the size of
things as they are

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:04.015
And spoke the feeling for them,
which was what they had

00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:08.067
lacked.
This is a version of the

00:07:08.067 --> 00:07:13.730
hero-poet in Stevens as a kind
of creative force,

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:18.539
a figure that appears in
Stevens's poems in many guises,

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:24.704
as a "scholar of one candle,"
as the single man,

00:07:24.704 --> 00:07:29.310
as a rabbi, as a giant.
 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.929
In "Notes Toward a Supreme
Fiction," he's called "the

00:07:34.929 --> 00:07:38.156
MacCullough."
In what sense is,

00:07:38.156 --> 00:07:42.220
however, this creative force
– this giant,

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.000
this figure of the poet – a
reader?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.360
What sense does it make to call
the poet a reader?

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.529
What the poet does here is read
the world.

00:07:56.529 --> 00:08:00.629
Writing is a kind of reading,
for Stevens.

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:04.620
He reads the world as if it
were a poetic text.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.990
His poem is a kind of reading.
 

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.250
It's kind of reading in the
sense of interpretation and in

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.339
the sense of reading aloud,
as I've just been doing.

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:17.986
It's a vocalization of "the
outlines of being and its

00:08:17.986 --> 00:08:22.329
expressings," to use Stevens's
phrase.

00:08:22.329 --> 00:08:25.885
It's a kind of
putting-into-speech of the

00:08:25.885 --> 00:08:27.930
world, of experience.
 

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.839
The suggestion is that the
poet's utterance,

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:37.062
which is something that sounds,
it sounds in the ear,

00:08:37.062 --> 00:08:42.990
is a kind of decoding of the
primary text of the world,

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.398
suggesting that the world is a
kind of poem,

00:08:46.398 --> 00:08:50.995
something that can be and must
be read in just the same way

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:53.769
that we read poems on the page.
 

00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:56.963
And in fact,
it's one thing that reading

00:08:56.963 --> 00:09:01.139
poems on the page can help us to
do, for Stevens;

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:06.309
that is, in a sense,
learn how to read the world.

00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:10.500
Let's look at this figure a
little more closely.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.486
The creator Stevens describes,
here as elsewhere,

00:09:14.486 --> 00:09:17.460
is large.
Why?

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.090
Well, Stevens himself was.
 

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.700
He was a big guy.
 

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.216
He's large, too,
because he's a parent,

00:09:27.216 --> 00:09:31.971
he's a grownup.
He's a kind of consoling and

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:37.539
comprehensive figure in this
poem and in others.

00:09:37.539 --> 00:09:41.360
He's also large because he is
an abstraction.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.659
He's in that sense a
generalization.

00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:50.615
When Stevens speaks of the
abstract, he doesn't mean the

00:09:50.615 --> 00:09:55.299
insubstantial or invisible but
rather the general,

00:09:55.299 --> 00:10:00.282
a kind of representative and
summative figure,

00:10:00.282 --> 00:10:03.049
made out of many parts.
 

00:10:03.049 --> 00:10:06.260
In this sense,
the large red man is large

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.310
because he is a kind of
abstraction.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.330
He is the sum of many parts.
 

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.401
He represents,
as I say, a general human

00:10:15.401 --> 00:10:19.180
capacity.
He's red, moreover,

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:25.548
because he's vital,
"primitive" in the sense of

00:10:25.548 --> 00:10:29.009
primary or aboriginal.
 

00:10:29.009 --> 00:10:35.271
He is a Native American,
"native" in the sense that he's

00:10:35.271 --> 00:10:42.101
a kind of projection of a place,
located in and rooted in the

00:10:42.101 --> 00:10:45.706
place.
Adam, after all,

00:10:45.706 --> 00:10:50.330
means "red clay," doesn't it?
 

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.340
He's red also because he is
red-blooded.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:01.432
He's healthy.
And keep in mind that all these

00:11:01.432 --> 00:11:09.978
properties are sort of metaphors
or figures for human capacity,

00:11:09.978 --> 00:11:14.940
for aspects of voice and of
soul.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.210
And finally,
he's red because he's a reader.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:22.318
Stevens is punning,
he's suggesting that to be a

00:11:22.318 --> 00:11:27.913
reader, to read is to be able to
recognize and speak the language

00:11:27.913 --> 00:11:32.444
of the world,
and it is in the process to be

00:11:32.444 --> 00:11:38.027
reddened, to be filled with
vitality and life and native

00:11:38.027 --> 00:11:42.983
strength and blood,
what Stevens calls in this poem

00:11:42.983 --> 00:11:46.691
"feeling."
He "spoke the feeling" for his

00:11:46.691 --> 00:11:50.620
auditors, "which is what they
had lacked."

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:57.192
Think of those auditors,
those ghosts who come to hear

00:11:57.192 --> 00:12:02.277
the poem, the poem that he's
chanting, as,

00:12:02.277 --> 00:12:06.990
well, they're figures of the
dead.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:14.592
You could think of them as
representing dead parts of

00:12:14.592 --> 00:12:20.879
ourselves, ourselves living in
dead ways.

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:27.378
You can see them representing
anyone who comes to poetry in

00:12:27.378 --> 00:12:32.419
some state of death or of
deadened feeling,

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:39.106
which is of course the feeling
that the people in The Waste

00:12:39.106 --> 00:12:40.860
Land have.
 

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:47.820
Think of them as anyone who
comes to poetry seeking to know

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.940
life and to be creative.
 

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:56.181
Renewal, regeneration:
this is what the poem gives

00:12:56.181 --> 00:12:58.510
them;
it's what Stevens wants.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.870
That's Williams's theme;
it's Stevens's too.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:07.159
"Poesis": that Greek word means
"making."

00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:15.091
Poetry is a means of redemption
because it speaks feeling,

00:13:15.091 --> 00:13:21.074
and feeling in Stevens is a
matter of sense,

00:13:21.074 --> 00:13:25.861
of sentiment.
Some of Stevens's detractors

00:13:25.861 --> 00:13:29.754
– which he has,
it must be admitted – view

00:13:29.754 --> 00:13:33.560
him as a kind of sterile
intellectualist.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.399
This is not true.
 

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:42.246
Stevens is fundamentally a poet
of sentiment and in this way is

00:13:42.246 --> 00:13:46.490
in quite conventional ways a
romantic poet.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:52.536
He has many defenses against
the obvious danger of being a

00:13:52.536 --> 00:13:57.309
poet of sentiment,
that is, sentimentality.

00:13:57.309 --> 00:13:59.429
How does he avoid being
sentimental?

00:13:59.429 --> 00:14:03.380
Well, there's all that nonsense
in Stevens.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.769
There's the impersonality.
 

00:14:05.769 --> 00:14:11.280
There's continually a kind of
acute self-consciousness.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.549
There's abstract discourse.
 

00:14:13.549 --> 00:14:18.442
Stevens is often called,
because of that abstract

00:14:18.442 --> 00:14:25.169
discourse, a philosophical poet,
and he is a philosophical poet.

00:14:25.169 --> 00:14:30.693
However, we need to understand
what that means in Stevens's

00:14:30.693 --> 00:14:33.773
case.
His work raises philosophical

00:14:33.773 --> 00:14:37.019
problems and often does so
explicitly;

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:40.402
that is, problems of knowledge
and problems of being,

00:14:40.402 --> 00:14:42.613
which are problems of
epistemology,

00:14:42.613 --> 00:14:44.240
problems of ontology.
 

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:50.199
But it's misleading to focus on
these dimensions of his work

00:14:50.199 --> 00:14:55.755
without also at the same time
addressing the question of

00:14:55.755 --> 00:14:59.738
sentiment.
Again from his Adagia,

00:14:59.738 --> 00:15:03.635
Stevens says,
"A poem should be part of one's

00:15:03.635 --> 00:15:07.215
sense of life."
"A poem should be part of one's

00:15:07.215 --> 00:15:10.674
sense of life";
"sense" in two senses:

00:15:10.674 --> 00:15:15.986
"sense" in the sense of
"understanding" is always

00:15:15.986 --> 00:15:21.629
implicated in "sense" as
"feeling," for Stevens.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:26.830
The priority of sound in
Stevens's poetry--which is the

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:32.224
primary "sense" in poetry for
Stevens – the priority of

00:15:32.224 --> 00:15:37.907
sound in Stevens is emblematic
of the priority of feeling in

00:15:37.907 --> 00:15:43.204
Stevens and emblematic of the
priority of aesthetics for

00:15:43.204 --> 00:15:49.011
Stevens – aesthetics,
the domain of the senses and of

00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:53.925
feeling – the priority of
aesthetics over and against

00:15:53.925 --> 00:15:57.190
philosophy.
Stevens is a philosophical poet

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.043
who includes philosophy as a
kind of partial knowledge within

00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:06.167
the larger total knowledge;
that is, a knowledge of feeling

00:16:06.167 --> 00:16:09.364
that the aesthetic,
that poetry,

00:16:09.364 --> 00:16:11.840
provides and imparts.
 

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:18.330
Let's look together at three
poems that give a sense of this

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:24.820
total knowledge that I'm talking
about – a total knowledge

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:31.529
representing a kind of unity of
mind and body for Stevens that

00:16:31.529 --> 00:16:38.240
incorporates feeling,
incorporates sense.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:44.553
For example,
"The Poem That Took the Place

00:16:44.553 --> 00:16:49.019
of a Mountain" on page 264.
 

00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:54.398
Stevens, like his great
inheritor, John Ashbery,

00:16:54.398 --> 00:17:00.920
I think, wrote titles and
collected them and is the author

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:06.070
of not just great poems but
great titles.

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:06.950
And here's one.
 

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:11.079
 
 

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:17.580
Here and in other late Stevens
poems – poems that he wrote

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:24.081
while specifically having in
mind producing or reflecting on

00:17:24.081 --> 00:17:29.039
his collected poems – and
incidentally,

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:33.795
this is a kind of dream that
Stevens's whole career is

00:17:33.795 --> 00:17:37.420
characterized by;
that is, the sense of creating

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.619
a body of work that would be in
some sense total.

00:17:40.619 --> 00:17:43.681
His first book is called
Harmonium and it's an

00:17:43.681 --> 00:17:46.920
enormous book which he waited a
long time to publish,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:52.994
and he imagined perhaps
producing a book called The

00:17:52.994 --> 00:17:55.859
Whole of Harmonium.
 

00:17:55.859 --> 00:18:01.167
His poem "Notes Toward a
Supreme Fiction" suggests that

00:18:01.167 --> 00:18:05.594
ambition to produce,
again, a sort of supreme

00:18:05.594 --> 00:18:11.256
fiction, a kind of total poem,
even as that title also admits

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:14.369
the impossibility of doing so.
 

00:18:14.369 --> 00:18:22.771
Here, late in life in 1952,
he is contemplating his career

00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:29.699
as a whole and the body of work
he has produced,

00:18:29.699 --> 00:18:35.890
and this is a poem reflecting
on that.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:40.039
There it was,
word for word,

00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:42.790
The poem that took the place of
a mountain.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:48.989
He breathed its oxygen,
Even when the book lay turned

00:18:48.989 --> 00:18:51.140
in the dust of his table.
 

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.769
It reminded him how he had
needed

00:18:54.769 --> 00:18:59.609
A place to go in his own
direction [when he began],

00:18:59.609 --> 00:19:03.832
How [in the process of creating
that body of work]

00:19:03.832 --> 00:19:06.720
he had recomposed
the pines,

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.660
Shifted the rocks and picked
his way among clouds,

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.420
For the outlook that would be
right,

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:22.160
Where he would be complete in
an unexplained completion:

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.089
The exact rock where his
inexactnesses

00:19:25.089 --> 00:19:28.885
Would discover,
at last, the view toward which

00:19:28.885 --> 00:19:33.309
they had edged,
Where he could lie and,

00:19:33.309 --> 00:19:39.117
gazing down at the sea,
Recognize his unique and

00:19:39.117 --> 00:19:43.273
solitary home.
Here, producing a poem,

00:19:43.273 --> 00:19:47.507
producing a body of poetry,
living in poetry in the way

00:19:47.507 --> 00:19:51.349
Stevens has done,
is like climbing a mountain;

00:19:51.349 --> 00:19:56.690
or rather, it's like both
creating and climbing the

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:02.671
mountain – both those things,
step by step or "word for

00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:05.513
word."
That's that interesting phrase

00:20:05.513 --> 00:20:07.109
that the poem begins with.
 

00:20:07.109 --> 00:20:11.610
Usually, we use that phrase to
describe what?

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.249
A kind of transcription;
it was a "word for word"

00:20:15.249 --> 00:20:19.495
transcript or a translation:
it was a "word for word"

00:20:19.495 --> 00:20:22.839
translation.
It suggests that the poem that

00:20:22.839 --> 00:20:25.807
Stevens is talking about is,
in some sense,

00:20:25.807 --> 00:20:29.402
a transcription or translation,
word for word,

00:20:29.402 --> 00:20:34.511
which suggests in turn that the
world was, even before it was

00:20:34.511 --> 00:20:39.338
put into language,
already a kind of language,

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:42.039
a set of words,
a text.

00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:47.529
This develops the idea that the
poet in Stevens is a reader.

00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:52.696
Writing here is an act of
rendering the words of the

00:20:52.696 --> 00:20:57.559
world, making them over into the
poet's words,

00:20:57.559 --> 00:21:03.785
and making them in this process
available in and through his

00:21:03.785 --> 00:21:07.300
words.
What is the nature of this

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.279
translation or substitution?
 

00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:19.079
The phrase "took the place of"
connotes both displacement and

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:24.006
compensation.
The poem took the place of a

00:21:24.006 --> 00:21:26.470
mountain;
it displaces it.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:31.490
It also compensates for the
loss of it.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:37.449
The world is somehow lost
always in experience but then

00:21:37.449 --> 00:21:42.867
also found again in writing,
in the act of creation that

00:21:42.867 --> 00:21:47.783
Stevens refers to as expressing
his need of a place to go in his

00:21:47.783 --> 00:21:50.693
own direction.
"It reminded him how he had

00:21:50.693 --> 00:21:53.390
needed / a place to go in his
own direction."

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.960
That could almost be Frost.
 

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.759
That's the kind of phrase Frost
might have used.

00:21:58.759 --> 00:22:02.712
It suggests both a kind of
public ambition perhaps,

00:22:02.712 --> 00:22:05.480
also personal and private
escape;

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.038
some kind of,
in any case,

00:22:08.038 --> 00:22:14.180
claim for independence and
originality, eccentricity even.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.614
It says that in remaking the
world in language,

00:22:18.614 --> 00:22:22.759
in the act of going in his own
direction,

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:26.101
the poet has created a certain
point of view,

00:22:26.101 --> 00:22:28.380
a perspective on experience.
 

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:34.229
It's what Stevens will call
"his unique and solitary home":

00:22:34.229 --> 00:22:40.381
the world according to himself,
which is as it must be for all

00:22:40.381 --> 00:22:42.690
of us.
Stevens says,

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:47.789
"he would be complete in an
unexplained completion,"

00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:52.490
"completion" meaning "the end of
the climb,"

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:57.964
that his creation must go
beyond explanation in the same

00:22:57.964 --> 00:23:01.250
way that poetry,
the aesthetic,

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:06.759
must pass beyond philosophy.
 

00:23:06.759 --> 00:23:12.000
Stevens says in another poem
that poetry "must resist the

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.650
intelligence,
/ Almost successfully."

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:21.549
He's interested in an
unexplained completion.

00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:25.020
He values poetry's
"inexactnesses."

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.230
It's an interesting word.
 

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:33.874
His inexactnesses carry him
along as he climbs edgewise –

00:23:33.874 --> 00:23:38.059
he "edges" – with the
implication that,

00:23:38.059 --> 00:23:42.280
I suppose, on a mountain top,
which is a precarious place

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.370
where the ground is steep and
unstable,

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:48.089
you can only proceed carefully.
 

00:23:48.089 --> 00:23:54.779
You can only proceed by edging
along.

00:23:54.779 --> 00:23:58.339
Poetry's path,
in Stevens, is oblique.

00:23:58.339 --> 00:24:04.950
"Tell all the truth but tell it
slant," Emily Dickinson said.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:08.260
Stevens's telling is oblique,
slanted.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.000
He moves edgewise in his poems.
 

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.880
He goes up the side of his high
subjects.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:20.521
Yet in this way,
he gives poetry in the end a

00:24:20.521 --> 00:24:23.539
view of the whole.
 

00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:28.428
And for all of its imaginings
and for all of its celebration

00:24:28.428 --> 00:24:31.908
of imagining,
for all of its celebration of

00:24:31.908 --> 00:24:36.797
poetry's power to displace the
world and take the place of a

00:24:36.797 --> 00:24:40.610
mountain,
the poem rests on a rock that

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:46.016
is real: the rock of the real,
which is a metaphor that recurs

00:24:46.016 --> 00:24:50.269
over and over again in Stevens's
late poetry.

00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:54.790
You could keep in mind another
one of Stevens's adages,

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:58.390
one of his late adages:
"The real," he says,

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.990
"is only the base,
but it is the base."

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:05.833
This could be a kind of
epigraph for this poem and many

00:25:05.833 --> 00:25:09.818
other Stevens poems,
and it's an important idea to

00:25:09.818 --> 00:25:14.990
keep in mind as you try to think
about the relationship between

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.160
imagination and reality in
Stevens.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.987
Along with the idea,
in fact, that Stevens is a

00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:26.230
philosophical poet and a kind of
intellectualist,

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:30.012
there is the idea that he is an
idealist who,

00:25:30.012 --> 00:25:34.482
because he believes in the
power of the mind to bring

00:25:34.482 --> 00:25:38.856
reality into being,
denies the reality of the

00:25:38.856 --> 00:25:42.512
physical world.
This is another mistake,

00:25:42.512 --> 00:25:47.109
as that adage about the real
and the base suggests.

00:25:47.109 --> 00:25:50.930
Stevens's last book of poems
was called The Rock.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:57.110
There are many images of
material reality in late

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.359
Stevens, and they're important.
 

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:05.835
Look at "The Plain Sense of
Things" on page 266,

00:26:05.835 --> 00:26:07.740
another late poem.
 

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.349
 
 

00:26:12.349 --> 00:26:15.584
Think of how many of these
poems focus on moments of

00:26:15.584 --> 00:26:16.980
seasonal transition.
 

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.491
Here's another.
After the leaves have

00:26:20.491 --> 00:26:23.049
fallen, we return
To a plain sense of things.

00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:27.809
[And there's that word "sense"
again, in all of

00:26:27.809 --> 00:26:30.440
its multiple senses.]
It is as if

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.380
We had come to an end of the
imagination,

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.990
Inanimate in an inert
savoir.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.300
 
 

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:45.736
And he continues:
Yet the absence of the

00:26:45.736 --> 00:26:50.030
imagination had
Itself to be imagined.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.040
The great pond,
The plain sense of it,

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.650
without reflections,
leaves,

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:58.130
Mud, water like dirty glass,
expressing silence

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:03.539
Of a sort, silence of a rat
come out to see,

00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:06.930
The great pond and its waste of
the lilies, all this

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.019
Had to be imagined as an
inevitable knowledge,

00:27:10.019 --> 00:27:14.940
Required, as a necessity
requires.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:21.980
Here, Stevens is imagining the
end of the fall,

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:27.950
imagining what is beyond
imagination;

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.700
imagining, too,
where imagination ends,

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.759
where it tends,
and its goal.

00:27:34.759 --> 00:27:39.619
Compare this to a late poem
like "Circus Animals' Desertion"

00:27:39.619 --> 00:27:44.808
in Yeats where the poet descends
from the ladders of imagination

00:27:44.808 --> 00:27:48.680
" the foul rag and bone shop of
the heart."

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:53.708
Stevens is treating this theme
himself in somewhat different

00:27:53.708 --> 00:27:57.207
terms.
You could also compare this

00:27:57.207 --> 00:28:03.781
poem to "Poems From Our Climate"
and the will to come to primary

00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:08.789
terms in that poem,
or "The Man on the Dump";

00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:15.298
just as in "Poems of Our
Climate," as Stevens does arrive

00:28:15.298 --> 00:28:21.483
at something like primary terms,
what he calls here "the plain

00:28:21.483 --> 00:28:26.490
sense of things," what might be
a limit or base for imagination,

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:32.277
the real.
His poem moves to recover and

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:36.859
reassert the power of
imagination.

00:28:36.859 --> 00:28:41.796
Even the end of imagination,
he says, "had to be imagined as

00:28:41.796 --> 00:28:46.148
an inevitable knowledge" – an
inevitable knowledge:

00:28:46.148 --> 00:28:51.419
a phrase that equivocates as to
whether this knowledge had to be

00:28:51.419 --> 00:28:56.607
imagined of necessity or whether
its necessity had itself to be

00:28:56.607 --> 00:29:01.121
imagined,
which is an idea that reasserts

00:29:01.121 --> 00:29:05.710
the dominance of the mind even
in its defeat,

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.786
you could say.
And in this sense,

00:29:08.786 --> 00:29:13.970
the poem is a small example of
that long tradition of the

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:17.962
Kantian sublime,
where the mind is somehow

00:29:17.962 --> 00:29:22.783
checked and awed by natural
force or natural powers –

00:29:22.783 --> 00:29:27.605
something greater than itself
– and then recovers its

00:29:27.605 --> 00:29:33.052
strength as it recognizes that
this defeat is itself a kind of

00:29:33.052 --> 00:29:37.069
mental representation or
construction.

00:29:37.069 --> 00:29:41.634
External reality,
its endurance and its

00:29:41.634 --> 00:29:47.038
materiality, is,
in fact, a consoling fact for

00:29:47.038 --> 00:29:51.670
Stevens,
which he affirms in another

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:57.223
poem, a poem not in your
anthology but one of my

00:29:57.223 --> 00:30:01.626
favorites,
placed last in his Collected

00:30:01.626 --> 00:30:04.769
Poems and in your RIS
packet.

00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:10.619
It's called "Not Ideas About
the Thing but the Thing Itself."

00:30:10.619 --> 00:30:14.669
Again, a kind of--The title
suggests a kind of encounter

00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:17.320
with reality in its primary
forms.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:25.000
 
 

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.675
Placed here,
at the very end of his

00:30:28.675 --> 00:30:34.081
Collected Poems,
it was a kind of last poem,

00:30:34.081 --> 00:30:41.000
though it was not by any means
the last poem he would write.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.485
At the earliest ending of
winter [and now it's not the end

00:30:45.485 --> 00:30:48.991
of fall but rather
the end of winter that Stevens

00:30:48.991 --> 00:30:54.139
is writing about],
In March, a scrawny cry from

00:30:54.139 --> 00:31:00.019
outside [and that's a
wonderfully resonate

00:31:00.019 --> 00:31:04.680
phrase--outside the room,
outside the mind]

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.626
Seemed like a sound
[nonetheless]

00:31:09.626 --> 00:31:15.710
in his mind.
He knew that he heard it,

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.810
A bird's cry,
at daylight or before,

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.400
In the early March wind.
 

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:27.086
The sun was rising at six,
No longer a battered panache

00:31:27.086 --> 00:31:31.829
above snow…
It would have been outside.

00:31:31.829 --> 00:31:35.309
It was not from the vast
ventriloquism

00:31:35.309 --> 00:31:38.434
Of sleep's faded
papier-mâché… [It wasn't

00:31:38.434 --> 00:31:42.270
something I dreamed or made up,
it can't have been.]

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:45.680
The sun was coming from outside.
 

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:51.880
That scrawny cry [and he comes
back to that word]--it was

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.430
A chorister whose c preceded
the choir.

00:31:55.430 --> 00:32:01.490
It was part of the colossal sun,
Surrounded by its choral rings,

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:05.940
Still far away.
It was like

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.000
A new knowledge of
reality.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.309
The poem begins with a
confusion of inner and outer.

00:32:15.309 --> 00:32:20.319
The cry that the poet hears,
he wants to say is outside him;

00:32:20.319 --> 00:32:22.760
it's important for him to say
it's outside him.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:27.835
Why?
If it's not outside him then

00:32:27.835 --> 00:32:34.250
the sign of life that it gives
and the promise of life's

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:40.198
continuance would be his own
projection and would be

00:32:40.198 --> 00:32:44.630
something liable to die with
him.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:50.235
He wants proof that the world
will go on without him,

00:32:50.235 --> 00:32:53.470
that spring will come again.
 

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:59.028
The cry is a kind of elemental
noise, the noise of the elements

00:32:59.028 --> 00:33:03.599
themselves and the sound of the
seasons changing.

00:33:03.599 --> 00:33:08.963
It is a complaint,
a lament, alarm,

00:33:08.963 --> 00:33:14.170
exclamation,
and shout for joy.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:20.159
It's the sound of daytime
returning, and with it spring at

00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:25.518
the earliest moment,
a kind of emergence from winter

00:33:25.518 --> 00:33:29.773
and death.
Stevens is a poet of change but

00:33:29.773 --> 00:33:35.072
of change within regenerative
cycles, of which night and day

00:33:35.072 --> 00:33:40.819
and the seasons themselves are
primary instances and symbols.

00:33:40.819 --> 00:33:47.531
Notice also that the world
makes itself known here in and

00:33:47.531 --> 00:33:52.030
as sound.
Life is something you hear.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:54.660
This also is like Frost.
 

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.160
The world is again a kind of
language.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.720
It's speaking to us.
 

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.113
Stevens, in describing it
through metaphors and similes

00:34:04.113 --> 00:34:08.324
and finding words for it,
is performing an act of reading

00:34:08.324 --> 00:34:11.250
again, of transcription,
and of translation.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:16.466
In particular,
he is providing figurative

00:34:16.466 --> 00:34:20.640
language for understanding it.
 

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.150
He calls the cry "scrawny."
 

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.380
It's a great word;
he uses it twice.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.390
What kinds of things are
scrawny?

00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:31.820
Babies are scrawny, right?
 

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:37.179
Old men are scrawny, both.
 

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:41.222
Here both ideas are held
together at this moment of

00:34:41.222 --> 00:34:45.992
seasonal transition when the
year is old and the year is new

00:34:45.992 --> 00:34:47.690
at the same time.
 

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:56.386
That single bird that gives
that cry is the poet's double,

00:34:56.386 --> 00:35:01.764
a kind of echo.
Maybe each are echoes of the

00:35:01.764 --> 00:35:05.309
other.
The bird suggests an image of

00:35:05.309 --> 00:35:10.319
how the poet himself is
integrated into the creative

00:35:10.319 --> 00:35:15.526
event that is the simple,
ordinary return of the world

00:35:15.526 --> 00:35:19.639
with dawn.
The poet, like the bird,

00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:25.469
is merely a chorister,
a voice among other voices in a

00:35:25.469 --> 00:35:30.420
kind of harmonium that is total
and whole.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:35.449
In this case,
his "c precedes the choir";

00:35:35.449 --> 00:35:39.960
that is, all the other voices
that are going to follow this

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.060
first one in the morning.
 

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.520
That "c" tunes them.
 

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.510
Here, alliteration is important.
 

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:55.687
It links the cry and the choir
and the chorister and the choral

00:35:55.687 --> 00:36:01.367
rings and the colossal sun that
generates all of them in a

00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:06.030
series of rings,
choral rings and vocal rings.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.300
And it's a wonderful image of
synesthesia.

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:15.815
This is light coming as sound
and sound as light at once,

00:36:15.815 --> 00:36:20.119
a kind of total sensory
experience.

00:36:20.119 --> 00:36:25.707
Stevens is imaging morning,
imagining it as a kind of

00:36:25.707 --> 00:36:31.833
synesthetic event and as the
arrival of a series of linked

00:36:31.833 --> 00:36:36.802
creativities,
all derived from the colossal

00:36:36.802 --> 00:36:42.219
sun of which the poem's bold and
somewhat simple,

00:36:42.219 --> 00:36:49.814
playful, and almost childlike
alliteration and punning are

00:36:49.814 --> 00:36:56.610
instances, are simply forms of
this choral music.

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:59.857
The poem's linguistic play,
in other words,

00:36:59.857 --> 00:37:04.188
displays the poet's power to
link the things of the world

00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:08.106
through sound,
to produce connections between

00:37:08.106 --> 00:37:12.148
them through words,
and is itself a kind of model

00:37:12.148 --> 00:37:17.033
and a case of those choral rings
through which the world is

00:37:17.033 --> 00:37:18.969
coming into being.
 

00:37:18.969 --> 00:37:20.930
Steven's poem,
in other words,

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:24.920
is a small version of the
creative event it's describing.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:30.654
It is like "a new knowledge of
reality," he says:

00:37:30.654 --> 00:37:36.747
"new" because refreshed,
newly experienced and newly

00:37:36.747 --> 00:37:40.498
activated.
It's also a knowledge of

00:37:40.498 --> 00:37:44.050
reality existing exactly in its
newness.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:47.945
The real is what is new,
what is emerging,

00:37:47.945 --> 00:37:52.030
and what is fresh,
carrying change to us.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:57.621
Pay attention to the sun in all
of Stevens's poems but

00:37:57.621 --> 00:38:03.529
especially in these late poems
where the sun is a kind of

00:38:03.529 --> 00:38:09.414
mythic presence.
The poet waits for the sun with

00:38:09.414 --> 00:38:15.380
the heroine Penelope in the
world as meditation.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:21.469
Penelope there is the sun's
bride, Ulysses' wife.

00:38:21.469 --> 00:38:27.171
Look at that poem as a kind of
late sublime version of "Sunday

00:38:27.171 --> 00:38:31.084
Morning."
Another version of the sun,

00:38:31.084 --> 00:38:37.601
of this heroic creative figure
is the giant in the poem called

00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:40.699
"A Primitive Like an Orb."
 

00:38:40.699 --> 00:38:45.803
This is a somewhat longer poem
and I'd like to look at some of

00:38:45.803 --> 00:38:47.559
its parts with you.
 

00:38:47.559 --> 00:38:53.061
The question in this poem,
which is in your RIS packet,

00:38:53.061 --> 00:38:59.378
is really the same question as
is posed by "Not Ideas About the

00:38:59.378 --> 00:39:04.064
Thing…" and that is:
what is the relationship

00:39:04.064 --> 00:39:09.769
between Stevens's poem and the
poems of the world?

00:39:09.769 --> 00:39:16.116
What is the link between his
creativity, or our creativity,

00:39:16.116 --> 00:39:22.026
in this larger system of
creation that Stevens's poetry

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:24.922
evokes?
Or in the language of this

00:39:24.922 --> 00:39:28.894
poem, what is the relationship
between Stevens's poems and the

00:39:28.894 --> 00:39:31.760
"essential poem at the center of
things"?

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.619
Let me read the second section
first.

00:39:36.619 --> 00:39:42.122
"The essential poem at the
center of things" is the first

00:39:42.122 --> 00:39:44.872
line.
It's kind of the theme that he

00:39:44.872 --> 00:39:46.110
will now explore.
 

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.540
And he says about it:
We do not prove the

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.820
existence of the poem.
 

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:54.590
 
 

00:39:54.590 --> 00:40:00.709
[We can't prove this kind of
bigger thing.

00:40:00.709 --> 00:40:05.489
Rather…]
It is something seen and known

00:40:05.489 --> 00:40:08.280
in lesser poems [in parts].
 

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.670
It is the huge,
high harmony that sounds

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:15.270
A little and a little, suddenly
By means of a separate sense.

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:21.520
It is and it
Is not and, therefore, is.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.855
In the instant of speech,
The breadth of an accelerando

00:40:25.855 --> 00:40:27.593
moves,
Captives the being,

00:40:27.593 --> 00:40:30.810
widens--and was there.
You can't grasp it;

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:35.156
it passes.
That "separate sense" is the

00:40:35.156 --> 00:40:39.401
sense that Steven's poems want
to get at in their

00:40:39.401 --> 00:40:43.470
inexactnesses,
sometimes in their nonsense.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:46.059
They're gesturing towards it.
 

00:40:46.059 --> 00:40:52.275
It's the existence of that
separate sense which is a sense

00:40:52.275 --> 00:40:56.420
of the whole,
of a kind of totality,

00:40:56.420 --> 00:41:01.862
and is affirmed precisely
through its invisibility,

00:41:01.862 --> 00:41:04.039
its non-existence.
 

00:41:04.039 --> 00:41:09.489
"It is and it / Is not and,
therefore, is."

00:41:09.489 --> 00:41:13.636
It exists in its
inaccessibility,

00:41:13.636 --> 00:41:18.430
in the fact that it is always
gone.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:20.480
It was always just there.
 

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:25.555
We feel it only ever in its
parts, which are synecdoches

00:41:25.555 --> 00:41:29.985
linked to the whole,
like the scrawny cry and the

00:41:29.985 --> 00:41:33.400
choral rings of the colossal
sun.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.739
They are parts that point to a
whole.

00:41:37.739 --> 00:41:44.599
Stevens carries this idea
forward then in section four.

00:41:44.599 --> 00:41:50.465
Here he is rewriting Theseus'
lines from A Midsummer

00:41:50.465 --> 00:41:54.918
Night's Dream:
"The poet, the lunatic,

00:41:54.918 --> 00:42:00.350
and the lover are of
imagination all compact."

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:05.181
Here he says:
One poem proves another

00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:09.128
and the whole,
For the clairvoyant men that

00:42:09.128 --> 00:42:11.230
need no proof:
[who are they?]

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:14.929
The lover, the believer and the
poet.

00:42:14.929 --> 00:42:17.484
Their words are chosen out of
their desire,

00:42:17.484 --> 00:42:22.308
[that's important in Stevens--
and remember desire is "hot" in

00:42:22.308 --> 00:42:25.019
us.
What is desire?

00:42:25.019 --> 00:42:27.342
It is]
The joy of language,

00:42:27.342 --> 00:42:30.290
[is it something apart from us?
 

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.980
No it's in us] when it
is themselves.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:37.972
With these [with these words,
the words "chosen out of

00:42:37.972 --> 00:42:40.534
desire," by the lover,
the believer,

00:42:40.534 --> 00:42:42.565
the poet]
they celebrate the central

00:42:42.565 --> 00:42:44.065
poem,
The fulfillment of

00:42:44.065 --> 00:42:45.559
fulfillments,
in opulent,

00:42:45.559 --> 00:42:49.404
Last terms, the largest [and
now he's going to start to get a

00:42:49.404 --> 00:42:53.520
little carried
away], bulging still with more,

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.210
[coma, moving on to the next
stanza]

00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:00.239
Until the used-to earth and
sky, and the tree

00:43:00.239 --> 00:43:03.230
And cloud, the used-to tree and
used-to cloud [what was there a

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:05.940
moment before],
Lose the old uses that they

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.506
made of them,
And they: these men,

00:43:08.506 --> 00:43:10.570
and earth and sky,
inform

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:13.538
Each other by sharp
informations,

00:43:13.538 --> 00:43:15.637
sharp,
Free knowledges,

00:43:15.637 --> 00:43:19.537
secreted until then,
Breaches of that which held

00:43:19.537 --> 00:43:22.829
them fast.
It is

00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:28.500
As if the central poem became
the world,

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:35.030
And the world the central poem,
each one the mate

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:39.336
Of the other [and you can think
about how often one finds images

00:43:39.336 --> 00:43:42.104
of
wedding or of mating in

00:43:42.104 --> 00:43:47.310
Stevens, such as in "The World
as Meditation"],

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:50.995
as if summer was a spouse,
Espoused each morning,

00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:54.117
each long afternoon,
And the mate of summer:

00:43:54.117 --> 00:43:59.104
her mirror and her look…
The essential poem begets the

00:43:59.104 --> 00:44:01.757
others.
[It creates the others.]

00:44:01.757 --> 00:44:04.001
The light
Of it is not a light apart,

00:44:04.001 --> 00:44:08.402
up-hill.
Rather, it exists down below in

00:44:08.402 --> 00:44:11.630
all of its component parts.
 

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:19.360
Let me read now sections seven
and following.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:24.699
It is one of the great
sentences in modern poetry.

00:44:24.699 --> 00:44:31.836
The poem begins with a
declaration: "The central poem

00:44:31.836 --> 00:44:35.679
is the poem of the whole."
 

00:44:35.679 --> 00:44:41.100
This might seem to say it all,
but rather, this declaration,

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:45.970
this principle is a generative
one that will now go on

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:50.665
generating verse,
much as this principle in the

00:44:50.665 --> 00:44:55.909
world goes on generating the
world that we experience.

00:44:55.909 --> 00:44:57.769
The central poem is the
poem of the whole,

00:44:57.769 --> 00:44:59.579
The poem of the composition of
the whole,

00:44:59.579 --> 00:45:02.590
The composition of blue sea and
of green,

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:06.860
Of blue light and of green,
as lesser poems,

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:11.170
And the miraculous multiplex of
lesser poems…

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:16.260
And again, by "poems" he means
individual poems;

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.424
he also means individual
perceptions, individual creative

00:45:19.424 --> 00:45:23.955
acts.
All are forms of making in the

00:45:23.955 --> 00:45:26.700
world.
"The miraculous multiplex of

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.940
lesser poems" are brought then:
Not merely into a whole,

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.168
but a poem of
The whole, the essential that

00:45:34.168 --> 00:45:38.583
is compact of its parts,
The roundness that pulls tight

00:45:38.583 --> 00:45:41.944
the final ring
And that which in an altitude

00:45:41.944 --> 00:45:44.446
would soar,
A vis [a power],

00:45:44.446 --> 00:45:47.190
a principle or,
it may be,

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:52.313
The meditation of a principle,
Or else [and here's Stevens's

00:45:52.313 --> 00:45:57.110
incredible rhetorical and
imaginative ability

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:01.997
to keep going and say "or" and
go on imagining things]

00:46:01.997 --> 00:46:04.369
an inherent order
active to be

00:46:04.369 --> 00:46:07.969
Itself, a nature to its natives
all

00:46:07.969 --> 00:46:11.619
Beneficence,
a repose, utmost repose,

00:46:11.619 --> 00:46:16.900
The muscles of a magnet aptly
felt [this is what this total

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:20.845
being, this total
poem that he is imagining is

00:46:20.845 --> 00:46:22.376
like.
And as he imagines it,

00:46:22.376 --> 00:46:23.239
as a totality,
he

00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:25.789
starts to imagine it as a
person],

00:46:25.789 --> 00:46:28.179
A giant, on the horizon,
glistening,

00:46:28.179 --> 00:46:31.150
And in bright excellence
adorned, crested

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:33.329
With every prodigal,
familiar fire,

00:46:33.329 --> 00:46:35.369
And unfamiliar escapades:
whirroos

00:46:35.369 --> 00:46:38.309
And scintillant sizzlings such
as children like,

00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:41.719
Vested in the serious folds of
majesty,

00:46:41.719 --> 00:46:45.289
Moving around and behind,
a following,

00:46:45.289 --> 00:46:48.110
A source of trumpeting seraphs
in the eye,

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:52.390
A source of pleasant outbursts
on the ear.

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:54.860
It's a wonderful vision.
 

00:46:54.860 --> 00:47:00.565
It calls to mind the great
appearance, the great spectacle

00:47:00.565 --> 00:47:06.672
of the appearance of the world
seen here suddenly as a kind of

00:47:06.672 --> 00:47:11.977
majestic giant figure
approaching us with the folds of

00:47:11.977 --> 00:47:15.880
royal garments.
That's what appearance is like

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.060
for Stevens.
And I think of the weather,

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:24.216
the hills of Connecticut – a
Sleeping Giant itself – as

00:47:24.216 --> 00:47:29.284
Stevens imagines a kind of
experience of the landscape and

00:47:29.284 --> 00:47:34.900
of the world as humanized,
a kind of humanized totality.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:39.524
That is, it's like a kind of
generalized and abstract image

00:47:39.524 --> 00:47:44.592
of the human;
an image of the human that is

00:47:44.592 --> 00:47:50.199
realized for Stevens in and
through play.

00:47:50.199 --> 00:47:54.565
These garments,
they're something that pleasure

00:47:54.565 --> 00:48:00.070
children and that pleasure us as
children are pleasured.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:05.414
The giant is a kind of image of
the essential poem,

00:48:05.414 --> 00:48:10.117
as he calls it,
and he will go on to describe

00:48:10.117 --> 00:48:13.110
it a little bit further.
 

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:16.001
He now says:
Here, then [in section

00:48:16.001 --> 00:48:20.486
eleven], is an abstraction given
head [what he's talking about is

00:48:20.486 --> 00:48:24.409
this general poem that's "given
head" in the sense of

00:48:24.409 --> 00:48:33.331
"allowed to go and expand and
have its way," but also

00:48:33.331 --> 00:48:38.650
anthropomorphized,
becoming],

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:41.739
A giant on the horizon,
given arms [in fact],

00:48:41.739 --> 00:48:44.679
A massive body and long legs,
stretched out,

00:48:44.679 --> 00:48:48.034
A definition with an
illustration [that is,

00:48:48.034 --> 00:48:50.910
the world is at once "a
definition

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:55.735
with an illustration"], not
Too exactly labelled,

00:48:55.735 --> 00:48:59.327
a large among the smalls
Of it, a close,

00:48:59.327 --> 00:49:02.635
parental magnitude,
At the centre on the horizon,

00:49:02.635 --> 00:49:05.678
concentrum, grave
And prodigious person,

00:49:05.678 --> 00:49:10.548
patron of origins.
Here, man is not created in

00:49:10.548 --> 00:49:16.086
God's image, but rather this
image is of God created in

00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:20.242
man's,
brought into being through play

00:49:20.242 --> 00:49:25.457
and through all the senses of
sense, representing a

00:49:25.457 --> 00:49:30.567
"definition with an
illustration" – a picture in

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:34.613
word: again,
abstract and concrete,

00:49:34.613 --> 00:49:40.296
an aesthetic whole that
includes a kind of philosophical

00:49:40.296 --> 00:49:44.659
knowledge in it.
This is what all art for

00:49:44.659 --> 00:49:47.820
Stevens aims at.
He says simply:

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:50.401
That's it.
The lover writes,

00:49:50.401 --> 00:49:53.452
the believer hears,
The poet mumbles and the

00:49:53.452 --> 00:49:55.980
painter sees,
Each one, his fated

00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:00.571
eccentricity,
As a part, [everything we do is

00:50:00.571 --> 00:50:05.151
a part, only a part]
but part, but tenacious

00:50:05.151 --> 00:50:09.213
particle,
Of the skeleton of the ether,

00:50:09.213 --> 00:50:11.710
[this big giant thing]...
 

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:15.707
…perceptions, clods
Of color, the giant of

00:50:15.707 --> 00:50:22.682
nothingness, each one [each one
of us, each one thing that we

00:50:22.682 --> 00:50:26.772
do]
And the giant ever changing,

00:50:26.772 --> 00:50:32.030
living in change.
"That's it," meaning,

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:35.500
that's the end of imagination.
 

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:38.683
It's the sense of its ending,
its terminus,

00:50:38.683 --> 00:50:42.195
and its goal.
But it turns out to be no

00:50:42.195 --> 00:50:47.514
ending at all but rather an
experience of a whole that is

00:50:47.514 --> 00:50:50.752
ongoing,
that is an experience of change

00:50:50.752 --> 00:50:54.289
that includes death,
and includes our own deaths,

00:50:54.289 --> 00:51:01.455
in a kind of totality that is
ever changing and living

00:51:01.455 --> 00:51:04.429
precisely in change.
 

00:51:04.429 --> 00:51:15.821
Well, we'll go on to a very
different poet on Wednesday –

00:51:15.821 --> 00:51:17.000
W.H.

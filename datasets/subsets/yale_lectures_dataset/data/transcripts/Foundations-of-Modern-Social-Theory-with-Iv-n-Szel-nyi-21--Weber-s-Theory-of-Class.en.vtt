00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.730
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.485
Well I think it is high time
that you start thinking about

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:09.070
your final paper.
 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.497
Let me just one more time tell
you what my expectation is.

00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:16.400
Right?
 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.240
There are three major blocks in
the course.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.010
For each of the blocks there is
a test.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.495
You have done two;
one more will be done,

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:28.360
last week of classes.
 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.200
I mean, the idea of the paper
is that you do a little more

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.000
ambitious work.
 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.080
Right?
 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.810
You link two of the blocks to
each other.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.000
So you compare Hobbes' theory
of human nature with Durkheim's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.979
theory of human nature,
or Hobbes, Rousseau and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.180
Durkheim, or something like
this.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.012
Or you look at the question of
power in Hobbes,

00:01:01.012 --> 00:01:03.548
Nietzsche and Weber.
 

00:01:03.548 --> 00:01:04.688
Right?
 

00:01:04.688 --> 00:01:07.950
Do two or three authors,
as such.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.674
I also highly recommend you
that you go what excites you the

00:01:16.674 --> 00:01:17.709
most.
 

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:21.170
You pick a topic what you find
exciting.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.748
If there was anything in this
course what made you excited,

00:01:24.748 --> 00:01:25.674
write about it.
 

00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:26.230
Right?
 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.189
And you can use earlier essay
topics, what you wrote up;

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.470
that's no problem.
 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.941
That will be a new paper
anyway--right?--because you have

00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:40.599
to link occasionally quite
distant authors to each other.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.364
And talk to your discussion
section leader,

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:49.385
or send an email--it can be
very short--just to make sure

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:52.614
that you are on the right
trajectory.

00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:53.690
Right?
 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.592
And probably your discussion
section leader will give you

00:01:57.592 --> 00:02:00.310
just a two-sentence response to
say,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.459
"Yes this seems to be
fine."

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.739
Or, "No you are taking on
too many;

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.310
there are two many authors.
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.229
Why don't you do only two or
three, rather than five,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.968
what you're suggesting?"
 

00:02:09.968 --> 00:02:14.645
Or, "Well you should be a
little more ambitious."

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:15.288
Right?
 

00:02:15.288 --> 00:02:18.199
This is the kind of feedback
you should expect.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:23.274
And otherwise--let me also say
that one more time--you know us

00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:27.018
in this course,
we want to make these abstract

00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:29.930
theories relevant to your life.
 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.370
So therefore don't shy away.
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.942
If you have opinions,
if you can reflect how the

00:02:36.942 --> 00:02:39.860
course helped,
or did not help,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.752
to understand yourself in
society, do so.

00:02:43.752 --> 00:02:44.919
Right?
 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:50.910
But I think you really should
talk to your discussion section

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.202
leader, or at least on email,
before you leave for the

00:02:56.202 --> 00:02:57.500
vacation.
 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.810
Because I want--when you are
tired of turkey,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.240
or you had enough beer and
watching football,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.543
and then you want to have fun,
then you can start working on

00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:14.782
your final paper.
 

00:03:14.782 --> 00:03:15.438
Right?
 

00:03:15.438 --> 00:03:19.807
You don't leave it to the very
end--right?--but you can use

00:03:19.807 --> 00:03:23.046
your spare time during
Thanksgiving's break,

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:24.930
to get started on it.
 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.348
And that's not a big deal.
 

00:03:26.348 --> 00:03:30.615
We want you to do something
like six or, at most,

00:03:30.615 --> 00:03:33.430
eight pages;
but more like six pages.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.030
This is not really much more
than the usual test essays.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.169
Okay.
 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.139
Is that all clear?
 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.340
Any question about this?
 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.590
No.
 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.300
Anyway, we will try to be as
un-bureaucratic about this as in

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.520
a bureaucratic organization you
can be.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.580
All right?
 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.044
As you have seen in this
course, we were trying to break

00:04:00.044 --> 00:04:03.132
the rules of bureaucracy,
and hopefully not at the

00:04:03.132 --> 00:04:04.770
expense of efficiency.
 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.360
All right, so this is Weber
theory on class.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.420
And this is probably--Weber,
next to Marx,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.778
is the most influential
theorist of class.

00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:24.348
And they are also on a
collision course with each

00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:28.250
other--a collision course in
many ways.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.069
I will elaborate on this.
 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:35.915
But just to foreshadow,
there are really three

00:04:35.915 --> 00:04:42.699
fundamentally important issues
where Marx and Weber disagree.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.726
Marx, as you recall,
identified classes in property

00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:49.035
relationship.
 

00:04:49.035 --> 00:04:49.940
Right?
 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.307
The class dichotomy was between
those who owned capital and

00:04:53.307 --> 00:04:55.690
those who owned only their labor
power.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.454
Weber, in contrast,
defines classes on the

00:05:00.454 --> 00:05:04.639
marketplace, as market
situations.

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.137
So the relationship--this will
be more complicated--but then

00:05:09.137 --> 00:05:13.177
the class relationship is
between the employer and the

00:05:13.177 --> 00:05:16.302
employee;
it is between the manager and

00:05:16.302 --> 00:05:20.346
the worker, and not the
owner--right?--and the possessor

00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:21.670
of labor power.
 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.149
Then Marx also said,
"Well all history of

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:28.860
humankind is history of class
struggles."

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.254
So Marx has a theory of class
which is overarching the whole

00:05:35.254 --> 00:05:36.990
human history.
 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.750
Weber is very specific about
this.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.800
Class is a modern phenomenon.
 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.889
Classes only emerged with the
emergence of the market economy,

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.230
market capitalism.
 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.798
Before capitalism they are
not--the stratification system

00:05:51.798 --> 00:05:55.752
is not based on class,
but it is based on status,

00:05:55.752 --> 00:06:00.019
and we will talk about the
notion of status a great deal.

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:04.449
And finally there is a third
important political difference.

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.355
Marx believed that class
struggle gets more intense over

00:06:08.355 --> 00:06:12.048
time, and therefore the
subordinated class eventually

00:06:12.048 --> 00:06:14.959
will revolt and overthrow
capitalism.

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:21.358
Weber believed that--in the
opposite: Class struggle is the

00:06:21.358 --> 00:06:26.894
most intense in early stages,
rough stages of capitalism,

00:06:26.894 --> 00:06:31.350
and as capitalism becomes
consolidated and bureaucratized,

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.839
class struggle is actually
reduced.

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:38.560
So these are the three
fundamental differences.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.819
And this is the outline of the
presentation today.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:48.069
So first of all I want to talk
about the usual interpretation

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:52.970
of Weber, and I want to
challenge this interpretation.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.444
If you ever took a course in
which Weber's theory of class

00:06:57.444 --> 00:07:00.036
was discussed,
you usually had the

00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:03.019
interpretation what I present
now.

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:06.793
If you go on the internet and
you find what Weber's got about

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:08.680
class, this is what you get.
 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.057
I disagree with it,
and I will try to show you why

00:07:13.057 --> 00:07:15.649
this is the wrong approach.
 

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:22.089
The usual interpretation goes
back to a British sociologist,

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:26.930
Runciman, who wrote about this
already in the 1960s--

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:35.317
he's still active actually--and
he interpreted Weber as offering

00:07:35.317 --> 00:07:42.240
a theory of social inequality in
three dimensions.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.315
Again, go on the internet;
ninety percent of internet

00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:53.690
posting on Weber and class will
give you this view.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.490
What are those three dimensions?
 

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.540
Status or prestige is one
dimension;

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.036
the second is class,
usually defined by income or

00:08:04.036 --> 00:08:07.550
wealth;
and the third dimension is

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:08.269
power.
 

00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:13.879
And therefore if you look at
stratification in society,

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:18.649
people can be unequal in any of
these--

00:08:18.649 --> 00:08:22.680
can be privileged in any of
these dimensions,

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.959
or all of the dimensions,
as such.

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:33.275
Runciman's conceptualization of
Weber's theory of class was

00:08:33.275 --> 00:08:38.700
extremely influential empirical
research.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.765
There was a lot of empirical
survey research carried out

00:08:42.765 --> 00:08:46.980
which was trying to measure how
people fare in these three

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.090
dimensions.
 

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:52.684
Gerhard Lenski,
who was Emeritus Professor,

00:08:52.684 --> 00:08:58.047
was professor at the University
of North Carolina,

00:08:58.047 --> 00:09:03.190
created the theory of status
inconsistency.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:08.769
The idea was that people
actually can be high in one of

00:09:08.769 --> 00:09:13.523
these dimensions,
and relatively low in another

00:09:13.523 --> 00:09:14.970
dimension.
 

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.412
So, for instance,
you are a professor of

00:09:19.412 --> 00:09:20.778
sociology.
 

00:09:20.778 --> 00:09:28.202
Then your prestige is sort of
reasonable--probably somewhat

00:09:28.202 --> 00:09:31.019
higher than average.
 

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:36.095
If you are a professor at Yale,
it's sort of even a little

00:09:36.095 --> 00:09:40.101
higher than average,
substantially higher than

00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:41.168
average.
 

00:09:41.168 --> 00:09:45.640
Well in terms of income,
if you are a professor of

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.385
sociology you will be again only
slightly higher than

00:09:50.385 --> 00:09:53.580
average--will not be very high.
 

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.144
In terms of power,
well you will be very low in

00:09:57.144 --> 00:09:58.850
the power hierarchy.
 

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.884
At least in the United
States--right?--nobody listens

00:10:02.884 --> 00:10:05.288
what sociologists are saying.
 

00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:07.855
Students do have
to--right?--and occasionally

00:10:07.855 --> 00:10:10.129
they have to take a sociology
course.

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:13.840
That's the only power really a
professor exercises.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:21.331
Well if you are a Supreme Court
justice, then your prestige is

00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:25.096
extremely high;
you are on the top of the

00:10:25.096 --> 00:10:28.519
prestige hierarchy,
at least in the United States.

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:32.712
If you are asking who is the
most prestigious occupation in

00:10:32.712 --> 00:10:34.158
the United States?
 

00:10:34.158 --> 00:10:37.503
In surveys people will say to
be a Supreme Court

00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:40.990
justice--right?--to serve on the
Supreme Court.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.429
Well in terms of income,
the Supreme Court justices

00:10:44.429 --> 00:10:46.769
probably don't do all that well.
 

00:10:46.769 --> 00:10:50.666
They probably do about as
university professors do.

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:51.288
Right?
 

00:10:51.288 --> 00:10:55.678
People in public service
usually don't do all that well.

00:10:55.678 --> 00:11:00.553
I think probably a governor of
a state is not earning more than

00:11:00.553 --> 00:11:02.519
a university professor.
 

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:06.700
But in terms of power they will
be very high.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.460
Right?
 

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.240
Supreme Court justices are very
high.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.855
Occasionally they can even
appoint--right?--the President

00:11:13.855 --> 00:11:18.389
of the United States;
if I may crack this joke. Right?

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:20.129
Anyway, they are very powerful.
 

00:11:20.129 --> 00:11:24.149
Well if you think about a
Mafioso.

00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:29.657
The prestige of a godfather,
except in the Mafia,

00:11:29.657 --> 00:11:31.606
will be very low.
 

00:11:31.606 --> 00:11:32.639
Right?
 

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:34.279
You regard it as criminal.
 

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:38.537
In terms of income,
will be on the very top.

00:11:38.537 --> 00:11:39.330
Right?
 

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.702
In terms of power,
well will have some power,

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:46.460
but mainly in the Mafia,
not really nationally.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.428
You see what they are getting
at?

00:11:48.428 --> 00:11:53.772
So therefore you can measure
status, class and power as three

00:11:53.772 --> 00:11:54.928
dimensions.
 

00:11:54.928 --> 00:12:00.192
And it is very helpful to
understand whether the social

00:12:00.192 --> 00:12:02.629
status is crystallized.
 

00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:08.412
People who have high prestige
also have high incomes and high

00:12:08.412 --> 00:12:11.710
power,
and let's say somebody who is

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:17.179
sweeping the floor--
right?--will have very low

00:12:17.179 --> 00:12:20.991
prestige,
very low income and no power at

00:12:20.991 --> 00:12:21.280
all.
 

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:21.860
Right?
 

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:26.200
So that is a useful way how to
stratify society for upper-upper

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.230
class to lower-lower class.
 

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:32.309
That is the way how Weber
usually has been used.

00:12:32.309 --> 00:12:35.610
Well I will challenge this.
 

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:42.320
I don't think I'm the only one
who does challenges.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.340
Anthony Giddens,
I think, gets very close to

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.639
what I am describing,
though probably he doesn't

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:51.379
stick his neck out as much as I
do.

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:56.047
My fundamental argument is that
Weber's distinction between

00:12:56.047 --> 00:12:59.830
class and status is a historical
distinction.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.565
And this is not accidental that
this is an English speaking

00:13:04.565 --> 00:13:08.403
person, Runciman,
who reads the notion of status

00:13:08.403 --> 00:13:10.690
the way how he reads it.
 

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.940
Because if you know a little
German,

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.908
and you try to read Weber in
German--

00:13:17.908 --> 00:13:23.287
you know that the word status
is actually translated from the

00:13:23.287 --> 00:13:25.080
word Stand.
 

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.542
And Stand,
well it can be translated into

00:13:28.542 --> 00:13:31.636
English as status,
but it's a not very good

00:13:31.636 --> 00:13:33.700
translation of the word.
 

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.639
The better translation is
estate.

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:41.668
Now if you would translate
Stand as estate,

00:13:41.668 --> 00:13:45.529
it would become obvious that
what Weber is trying to suggest,

00:13:45.529 --> 00:13:49.950
that there is something archaic
about status stratification,

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.490
as distinct from class
stratification,

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.898
which is a modern phenomenon.
 

00:13:55.898 --> 00:13:56.480
Right?
 

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:02.441
So this will be one of the
major points what I'm trying to

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:07.668
make, and will try to show this
from Weber text.

00:14:07.668 --> 00:14:12.956
Then the question is where is
the third dimension?

00:14:12.956 --> 00:14:13.820
Right?
 

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.264
As I've said,
status and class are historical

00:14:17.264 --> 00:14:19.850
categories, but where is power?
 

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.346
And when I was working on one
of my books, I was very much

00:14:24.346 --> 00:14:28.844
attracted to Runciman's idea,
and tried to interpret Weber

00:14:28.844 --> 00:14:29.870
this way.
 

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:34.336
And, in fact,
it appeared to me a great deal

00:14:34.336 --> 00:14:41.090
to use power as an independent
dimension of the class position.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:45.495
I was trying to understand the
social structure of communist

00:14:45.495 --> 00:14:49.604
societies, and their power
appeared to be an independent

00:14:49.604 --> 00:14:50.649
dimension.
 

00:14:50.649 --> 00:14:52.629
So I was looking into the Weber
text,

00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:56.104
and I read cover to cover
Economy and Society a

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:59.845
couple of times,
and I could not find the third

00:14:59.845 --> 00:15:00.759
dimension.
 

00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:03.178
Read it: it is not there.
 

00:15:03.178 --> 00:15:08.620
So trying to understand what
Weber is getting at,

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:15.535
I came to the conclusion that
for Weber power is the dependent

00:15:15.535 --> 00:15:17.009
variable.
 

00:15:17.009 --> 00:15:21.009
But he wants to explain where
power comes from,

00:15:21.009 --> 00:15:26.378
and whether power exercised is
exercised on the basis of class

00:15:26.378 --> 00:15:31.110
privileges,
or whether it is a status type

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:36.244
of, or estate type,
of power which is exercised in

00:15:36.244 --> 00:15:37.048
society.
 

00:15:37.048 --> 00:15:40.500
And this is very consistent
what you already know about Max

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.594
Weber--right?--type of
authorities, where power comes

00:15:43.594 --> 00:15:44.129
from.
 

00:15:44.129 --> 00:15:47.653
What legitimates
power--right?--tradition or

00:15:47.653 --> 00:15:49.702
legal-rational authority?
 

00:15:49.702 --> 00:15:50.440
Right?
 

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.857
Class stratification
corresponds to societies based

00:15:53.857 --> 00:15:55.908
on legal-rational authority.
 

00:15:55.908 --> 00:15:59.390
Status stratification
corresponds to traditional

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.279
authority.
 

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:01.830
All right?
 

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.889
Well I will elaborate a little
on this--

00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:10.570
will qualify this somewhat,
primarily because Weber--

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:15.558
like in his types of authority
as well--

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:20.058
has two balls in the air at the
same time.

00:16:20.058 --> 00:16:22.274
He has a
macro-theory--right?--of

00:16:22.274 --> 00:16:25.178
historical variations of
stratification.

00:16:25.178 --> 00:16:30.408
For him, transition from
traditional society in modern

00:16:30.408 --> 00:16:35.636
rational societies is a
transition from estate type of

00:16:35.636 --> 00:16:39.879
stratification to class
stratification.

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:45.418
But Weber also has a
micro-theory.

00:16:45.418 --> 00:16:49.167
He also said,
"Okay, society today is

00:16:49.167 --> 00:16:54.460
primarily class stratified,
but I can identify status power

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.738
in modern societies as
well," just exactly as he

00:16:58.738 --> 00:17:01.700
does with the types of
authority.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.578
Yes, the United States today is
legal-rational authority,

00:17:06.578 --> 00:17:10.440
but I can spot elements of
traditional authority,

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.951
or charismatic authority,
operating within legal-rational

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:15.920
authority.
 

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.148
Since it is dominantly
legal-rational authority,

00:17:19.148 --> 00:17:20.730
it will be secondary.
 

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.288
Law will make a difference.
 

00:17:24.288 --> 00:17:29.079
But tradition in this society,
in this very America today,

00:17:29.079 --> 00:17:31.012
does make a difference.
 

00:17:31.012 --> 00:17:31.769
Right?
 

00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:35.568
It is consequential where you
are in society.

00:17:35.568 --> 00:17:39.460
Traditional authority is
consequential.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.279
Right?
 

00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:45.614
We are all equal before the
law, but in practice where we

00:17:45.614 --> 00:17:49.519
end up has a lot to do with
tradition,

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:53.737
traditional prejudices,
the traditional way how power

00:17:53.737 --> 00:17:54.630
operates.
 

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:58.980
The same goes for--he brings
back the idea of status.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.352
This is why I said translating
Stand as status is not

00:18:03.352 --> 00:18:04.759
completely wrong.
 

00:18:04.759 --> 00:18:10.056
It only gets a footnote in the
Weber concept.

00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:11.019
Right?
 

00:18:11.019 --> 00:18:16.904
The footnote is Stand is
primarily a historical concept

00:18:16.904 --> 00:18:20.088
for past traditional societies.
 

00:18:20.088 --> 00:18:22.900
But by the way--this is the
footnote--

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.088
even in contemporary society,
in class stratified societies,

00:18:28.088 --> 00:18:32.462
there is power occasionally
exercised on the basis of

00:18:32.462 --> 00:18:33.220
status.
 

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:41.767
Well and obviously the power
which is exercised by a Supreme

00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:46.244
Court judge,
or the power exercised by a

00:18:46.244 --> 00:18:50.394
university professor,
the little one we have--that we

00:18:50.394 --> 00:18:53.990
may probably in some way try to
change your mind--

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:58.390
right?--which is an act of
power, some would say even an

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.150
act of coercive power.
 

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.868
Right?
 

00:19:00.868 --> 00:19:04.249
Bourdieu called it symbolic
violence.

00:19:04.249 --> 00:19:05.000
Right?
 

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.776
I violate your mind;
if I can penetrate your mind

00:19:09.776 --> 00:19:12.104
and put a new idea into your
mind.

00:19:12.104 --> 00:19:12.740
Right?
 

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.680
This is an act of power.
 

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.461
Well it's primarily done,
or a great deal done,

00:19:19.461 --> 00:19:21.877
by status;
that you say,

00:19:21.877 --> 00:19:26.102
"Well, this is a professor
who has a Ph.D.,

00:19:26.102 --> 00:19:28.079
must know it."
 

00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:28.838
Right?
 

00:19:28.838 --> 00:19:33.083
Then it is really--right?--the
reason why you start believing

00:19:33.083 --> 00:19:35.630
me has a lot to do with my
status.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:39.085
Hopefully not only the status;
hopefully I can make a good

00:19:39.085 --> 00:19:40.710
argument and persuade you.
 

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.239
But occasionally--it's a
mixture why you tend to believe

00:19:44.239 --> 00:19:45.521
me or disbelieve me.
 

00:19:45.521 --> 00:19:46.098
Right?
 

00:19:46.098 --> 00:19:50.654
And the very fact of the
status, what I am incumbent of,

00:19:50.654 --> 00:19:55.376
has something to do--right?--of
you trying to believe your

00:19:55.376 --> 00:19:56.618
professors.
 

00:19:56.618 --> 00:20:03.890
So let me work on the notion
how Weber defines classes.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:08.752
And the most important issue
is--the uniquely Weberian idea

00:20:08.752 --> 00:20:13.028
is that class has to be
identified on the market.

00:20:13.028 --> 00:20:18.577
And then I will also say a few
words about class interests and

00:20:18.577 --> 00:20:23.488
how he--to what extent he's
different from Marx in this

00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:24.579
respect.
 

00:20:24.579 --> 00:20:26.338
So class and market.
 

00:20:26.338 --> 00:20:30.818
Now here you have famous
definitions.

00:20:30.818 --> 00:20:35.220
He said class situation is
determined by market situation.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.660
Class situation is ultimately a
market situation.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.934
And this is very important now,
as follows.

00:20:43.934 --> 00:20:44.558
Right?
 

00:20:44.558 --> 00:20:48.291
"The effects of naked
possession per se is only the

00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:51.210
forerunner of real class
formation."

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.494
"Slaves",
he said--or you can say

00:20:54.494 --> 00:20:56.920
serfs--"are not a class.
 

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.048
They are rather a status
group."

00:21:00.048 --> 00:21:03.836
Now here you can
see--right?--the historical uses

00:21:03.836 --> 00:21:07.230
of the distinction between class
and status.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.019
Right?
 

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:11.450
And also the challenge to Marx.
 

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:17.188
Those who have property and
deprived from property do not

00:21:17.188 --> 00:21:19.338
constitute a class.
 

00:21:19.338 --> 00:21:24.612
And the fundamental argument
for this is that in traditional

00:21:24.612 --> 00:21:29.615
societies it is not really
property which puts you into a

00:21:29.615 --> 00:21:31.848
high status position.
 

00:21:31.848 --> 00:21:36.047
You being in a high status
position has the consequence

00:21:36.047 --> 00:21:37.680
that you are wealthy.
 

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.380
Right?
 

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:44.277
So the king or the queen
decides to give you nobility,

00:21:44.277 --> 00:21:46.948
and gives you an estate.
 

00:21:46.948 --> 00:21:47.950
Right?
 

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:52.960
In capitalism this works the
other way around.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.167
In order to become a
billionaire--right?--you don't

00:21:56.167 --> 00:22:00.338
have to get the approval of the
President of the United States.

00:22:00.338 --> 00:22:04.363
Simple enough:
you go to Wall Street,

00:22:04.363 --> 00:22:07.940
you invest your money smartly.
 

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.127
You start with a thousand
dollars and in no time you have

00:22:11.127 --> 00:22:14.259
a billion--right?--if you
invested it in a smart way.

00:22:14.259 --> 00:22:17.917
And then you are in the
class--right?--of billionaires.

00:22:17.917 --> 00:22:18.460
Right?
 

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:24.881
So here it is your property,
and your activity on the

00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:30.684
marketplace, which helps you to
enter the class.

00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:31.920
Right?
 

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.000
In the aristocracy it was a
legal act--

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.950
right?--a political act,
by a king or a queen,

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.220
which made you nobility,
made you a lord,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:47.762
and then as a consequence you
became wealthy.

00:22:47.762 --> 00:22:48.588
Right?
 

00:22:48.588 --> 00:22:50.328
It's also interesting,
by the way,

00:22:50.328 --> 00:22:53.263
that well if you lost your
wealth--there was some poor

00:22:53.263 --> 00:22:57.608
noble people--
you still retained your status

00:22:57.608 --> 00:22:59.798
estate privileges.
 

00:22:59.798 --> 00:23:02.462
So if you were nobility,
in most societies,

00:23:02.462 --> 00:23:05.380
for instance,
you did not have to pay taxes.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.548
Now if you lost all of your
estate,

00:23:09.548 --> 00:23:11.868
because you gambled--for
instance--right?--

00:23:11.868 --> 00:23:15.673
you wanted to go to Monte Carlo
where you gambled everything

00:23:15.673 --> 00:23:17.618
away--
then you became very poor.

00:23:17.618 --> 00:23:21.451
You were still noble and you
still did not have

00:23:21.451 --> 00:23:23.450
to--right?--pay taxes.
 

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.000
Your status privileges remained.
 

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.598
The opposite--right?--in
capitalism.

00:23:29.598 --> 00:23:34.806
You start fully investing your
money and you lose your money on

00:23:34.806 --> 00:23:38.670
the stock market,
you cease to be a capitalist.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:39.509
Right?
 

00:23:39.509 --> 00:23:42.250
Then you will have to seek to
find a job.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:42.798
Right?
 

00:23:42.798 --> 00:23:46.218
And since you lost all of your
money, you probably will not

00:23:46.218 --> 00:23:49.047
find a very good job,
because who wants to hire a

00:23:49.047 --> 00:23:49.401
loser?
 

00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:50.049
Right?
 

00:23:50.049 --> 00:23:54.150
Okay.
 

00:23:54.150 --> 00:24:00.358
This is also a very important
citation from Weber.

00:24:00.358 --> 00:24:04.599
He said, "Class position
really means that people have

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:06.500
common life chances."
 

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.160
Right?
 

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.894
If you are located differently,
there are positively and

00:24:11.894 --> 00:24:14.180
negatively--
this is the Weberian

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.368
point--positively and negatively
privileged positions on the

00:24:17.368 --> 00:24:18.180
marketplace.
 

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.871
And if you are negatively
privileged in the marketplace,

00:24:22.871 --> 00:24:25.855
your life chances are not very
good.

00:24:25.855 --> 00:24:26.710
Right?
 

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.041
If you are positively
privileged in the marketplace,

00:24:30.041 --> 00:24:32.328
then your life chances are
great.

00:24:32.328 --> 00:24:35.713
You guys in this room are all
very positively

00:24:35.713 --> 00:24:40.328
privileged--right?--because you
are getting a Yale degree;

00:24:40.328 --> 00:24:44.598
and probably a Harvard degree
would be even better for you.

00:24:44.598 --> 00:24:48.538
Don't tell Rick Levin that I
said that in class.

00:24:48.538 --> 00:24:49.210
Right?
 

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:55.538
But this is about the best
degree what you can have.

00:24:55.538 --> 00:24:59.372
So you are extremely
well-positioned on the labor

00:24:59.372 --> 00:24:59.931
market.
 

00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:00.650
Right?
 

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.000
Your life chances are great.
 

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.588
Right?
 

00:25:03.588 --> 00:25:07.169
You have to make a lot of
mistakes to screw this one.

00:25:07.169 --> 00:25:07.720
Right?
 

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.528
You are on the right trajectory.
 

00:25:10.528 --> 00:25:14.949
If you are in a community
college--right?--or you are a

00:25:14.949 --> 00:25:18.959
high school dropout,
then your life chances on the

00:25:18.959 --> 00:25:21.169
labor market will be lousy.
 

00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:22.068
Right?
 

00:25:22.068 --> 00:25:27.608
Especially you are poor,
you are African-American,

00:25:27.608 --> 00:25:33.113
you dropped out of high school,
well your chances that you will

00:25:33.113 --> 00:25:37.019
end up in jail before you turn
thirty is,

00:25:37.019 --> 00:25:38.500
I think, seventy percent.
 

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:43.240
So--right?--this is life
chances--right?--which in this

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.402
case, of course it is not only
class.

00:25:46.402 --> 00:25:47.279
Right?
 

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:50.151
There is a special type of
status group.

00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:50.740
Right?
 

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.958
Race, it also plays a
role--right?--in your

00:25:53.958 --> 00:25:56.180
deteriorating life chances.
 

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.311
Now let me also say that Weber
actually suggests that you can

00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:05.759
think of classes on every single
market situation.

00:26:05.759 --> 00:26:10.300
So, for instance,
some people--and myself in my

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:15.038
work--have been writing about
housing classes.

00:26:15.038 --> 00:26:19.707
The differences between the
owner of a house and the tenant

00:26:19.707 --> 00:26:24.776
who rents this house is a class
relationship--can be interpreted

00:26:24.776 --> 00:26:27.028
as a class relationship.
 

00:26:27.028 --> 00:26:30.240
The landlords,
very often by the tenants,

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.417
are seen as
bloodsuckers--right?--because

00:26:33.417 --> 00:26:38.105
they charge too high rent and
they do not maintain your unit

00:26:38.105 --> 00:26:39.140
properly.
 

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.098
You know?
 

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:43.618
When you call them and you say
that the water is dripping,

00:26:43.618 --> 00:26:47.407
and I need a plumber,
they will find excuses why they

00:26:47.407 --> 00:26:52.457
do not fix your water,
or why they do not fix your

00:26:52.457 --> 00:26:53.413
heating.
 

00:26:53.413 --> 00:26:54.369
Right?
 

00:26:54.369 --> 00:26:56.828
So they are bloodsuckers. Right?
 

00:26:56.828 --> 00:26:59.817
And, as a tenant,
you are in a negatively

00:26:59.817 --> 00:27:01.910
privileged class position.
 

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.608
That's true.
 

00:27:03.608 --> 00:27:07.826
But on the other hand Weber is
quite clear that there are two

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:12.255
important market positions which
fundamentally define your class

00:27:12.255 --> 00:27:17.940
position,
and these are the labor market

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.641
and,
in fact, the capital market,

00:27:21.641 --> 00:27:26.325
will define whether you are--
have good life chances or poor

00:27:26.325 --> 00:27:27.130
life chances.
 

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.230
And all other positions,
on other markets,

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:34.768
will be a consequence of your
position primarily on the labor

00:27:34.768 --> 00:27:37.338
market, or on capital markets.
 

00:27:37.338 --> 00:27:42.231
Well this actually brings Weber
and Marx a little closer than it

00:27:42.231 --> 00:27:45.775
appeared for the first time--
right?--because,

00:27:45.775 --> 00:27:48.970
as we will see,
Weber does acknowledge that if

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:53.433
there is a market economy,
differences in property are

00:27:53.433 --> 00:27:57.240
very important to creating class
positions.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.963
But, unlike Marx,
he emphasizes this is only the

00:28:00.963 --> 00:28:04.528
case if there is a market
economy in place.

00:28:04.528 --> 00:28:09.528
Now just very briefly about
class interest and class action.

00:28:09.528 --> 00:28:13.602
And here he said,
"Well the statement by a

00:28:13.602 --> 00:28:18.559
talented author"--he
doesn't tell us who that author

00:28:18.559 --> 00:28:21.260
is;
I assume it must be Karl

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.549
Marx--"that the individual
may be in error concerning his

00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:31.838
interests but the class is
infallible about its interest,

00:28:31.838 --> 00:28:34.240
is false and
pseudo-scientific."

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.103
So he said, "Well the
classes are actually not

00:28:38.103 --> 00:28:39.493
communities."
 

00:28:39.493 --> 00:28:40.190
Right?
 

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:44.210
A community may have a kind of
collective understanding.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:49.817
You belong to a class just
because of your position of the

00:28:49.817 --> 00:28:53.557
labor market,
and you actually--here he

00:28:53.557 --> 00:28:56.017
subscribes to Adam Smith.
 

00:28:56.017 --> 00:28:57.098
Right?
 

00:28:57.098 --> 00:29:02.122
Class members are individuals
acting out of self-interest,

00:29:02.122 --> 00:29:06.000
and not acting out of
collective interest.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.828
But they are in a similar
position,

00:29:07.828 --> 00:29:10.798
and therefore they have common
class interests,

00:29:10.798 --> 00:29:13.849
and--surprise,
surprise--occasionally they

00:29:13.849 --> 00:29:17.740
will act the same way--
right?--because they have a

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:21.324
collective interest;
but not as a community,

00:29:21.324 --> 00:29:26.205
but as rationally acting
individuals, determined by their

00:29:26.205 --> 00:29:30.390
rational actions--right?--on the
marketplace.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:34.137
And therefore,
he said, "Well classes

00:29:34.137 --> 00:29:39.714
will really exist--well how can
I tell that the classes really

00:29:39.714 --> 00:29:40.630
exist?
 

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.568
I can tell if I see classes
acting.

00:29:43.568 --> 00:29:47.000
Classes materialize in
action--right?--

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.568
because I speculatively cannot
make any class distinction,

00:29:51.568 --> 00:29:55.527
but people will make
distinctions for classes by

00:29:55.527 --> 00:29:58.980
acting upon their class
interest."

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:04.829
Now let's go on to the question
of status groups;

00:30:04.829 --> 00:30:06.358
what are status groups?
 

00:30:06.358 --> 00:30:11.220
And well I briefly want to
identify who status groups are,

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:17.088
what status privileges are,
and then status stratification

00:30:17.088 --> 00:30:20.683
and the caste,
and the question of ethnicity

00:30:20.683 --> 00:30:21.319
in Weber.
 

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:22.868
So what is a status group?
 

00:30:22.868 --> 00:30:26.134
Well, unlike classes,
status group,

00:30:26.134 --> 00:30:30.644
or Stande--this is the
plural of the word

00:30:30.644 --> 00:30:34.390
Stand--are nominally
groups.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:39.998
Status groups means that you
belong to a group--right?--and

00:30:39.998 --> 00:30:44.638
you have a high esteem,
and you have a solidarity

00:30:44.638 --> 00:30:46.670
within the group.
 

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.875
You have an honor;
a certain honor is attributed

00:30:49.875 --> 00:30:52.179
to you when you are in a status
group.

00:30:52.179 --> 00:30:52.740
Right?
 

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.961
You are initiated--right?--into
becoming a nobleman by an act of

00:30:57.961 --> 00:30:59.950
the king or the queen.
 

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:05.126
Well in order to get a
university degree,

00:31:05.126 --> 00:31:11.470
you are initiated--right?--into
a status group.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:16.234
In a way to earn a university
degree--a Bachelor's degree,

00:31:16.234 --> 00:31:20.500
a Ph.D.--is entering in some
ways a status group.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:25.942
It's not accidental that we
wear these funny medieval robes

00:31:25.942 --> 00:31:31.480
on those ceremonies where the
degree is conferred on you.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.766
And many professions which
require formal university

00:31:35.766 --> 00:31:40.056
training act as a status group;
like the doctors

00:31:40.056 --> 00:31:43.470
constitute--right?--a status
group.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:47.634
Like, in some ways,
university professors

00:31:47.634 --> 00:31:50.548
constitute a status group.
 

00:31:50.548 --> 00:31:56.166
Lawyers constitute a status
group, and they somehow control

00:31:56.166 --> 00:32:00.330
ethics and entrance into the law
profession.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:01.298
Right?
 

00:32:01.298 --> 00:32:05.015
There you have to pass a board
exam if you want to become a

00:32:05.015 --> 00:32:05.462
lawyer.
 

00:32:05.462 --> 00:32:06.038
Right?
 

00:32:06.038 --> 00:32:09.227
And, in fact,
states will make--in

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:11.911
California,
if you want to move to

00:32:11.911 --> 00:32:15.539
California, you want to get a
law degree and you want to move

00:32:15.539 --> 00:32:17.797
to California,
you will sweat

00:32:17.797 --> 00:32:21.048
blood--right?--to pass the board
exam.

00:32:21.048 --> 00:32:25.492
If you want to go to South
Dakota, you will easily pass the

00:32:25.492 --> 00:32:26.490
board exam.
 

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:29.550
Because there are not many
lawyers who want to be lawyers

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.429
in South Dakota,
but there are many lawyers who

00:32:32.429 --> 00:32:34.759
want to be lawyers in San
Francisco,

00:32:34.759 --> 00:32:37.578
and therefore the board,
California board,

00:32:37.578 --> 00:32:40.720
will be much stricter than the
South Dakota board.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.365
The same goes for medical
exams.

00:32:43.365 --> 00:32:44.048
Right?
 

00:32:44.048 --> 00:32:49.101
It will be--again you have to
pass exams, and it will be

00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:53.970
different, depending on the
labor market condition.

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:57.724
And it's very important:
The status honor is expressed

00:32:57.724 --> 00:32:59.710
with a specific lifestyle.
 

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.430
The way how you dress,
the way how you eat,

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:08.124
the way how you behave,
is constituting what is status

00:33:08.124 --> 00:33:09.009
group.
 

00:33:09.009 --> 00:33:12.309
Traditionally--right?--noblemen
could wear arms;

00:33:12.309 --> 00:33:18.298
non-nobles couldn't.
 

00:33:18.298 --> 00:33:23.395
And well if you are a Yale
professor you wear J. Press.

00:33:23.395 --> 00:33:24.339
Right?
 

00:33:24.339 --> 00:33:27.230
&gt;
 

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:31.082
I mean, not everybody does,
but you can tell this is a Yale

00:33:31.082 --> 00:33:31.880
professor.
 

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:38.880
You can see this is a
J.***Press coat.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.096
So there
are--right?--lifestyles,

00:33:42.096 --> 00:33:45.815
what in a way,
even in modern society,

00:33:45.815 --> 00:33:48.730
constitute status groups.
 

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:51.182
Even within class
stratification,

00:33:51.182 --> 00:33:55.088
you have this uniquely
lifestyle specific stuff,

00:33:55.088 --> 00:34:00.690
what you adapt in order to
belong to this status group kind

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.490
of subgroup within a class.
 

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.616
So if you are a
"yuppie"--young urban

00:34:06.616 --> 00:34:09.472
professional,
right?--you get a nice job on

00:34:09.472 --> 00:34:11.784
Wall Street, you move to
Manhattan.

00:34:11.784 --> 00:34:12.599
Right?
 

00:34:12.599 --> 00:34:18.630
Then you rent out--right?--or
buy a condo somewhere in a Trump

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.519
building.
 

00:34:19.519 --> 00:34:20.409
Right?
 

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:26.420
Then you want to be driven by a
limo to your workplace.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:30.041
You will be reading Wall
Street Journal,

00:34:30.041 --> 00:34:33.585
and you will be
going--right?--and you will be

00:34:33.585 --> 00:34:36.184
having croissants for the
morning.

00:34:36.184 --> 00:34:37.130
Right?
 

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:38.922
You see what I'm getting at.
 

00:34:38.922 --> 00:34:39.369
Right?
 

00:34:39.369 --> 00:34:41.510
You will be dressed in a
certain way.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:44.735
People can tell--right?--this
person must be a

00:34:44.735 --> 00:34:47.099
broker--right?--on Wall Street.
 

00:34:47.099 --> 00:34:50.978
There are these lifestyle
characteristics what in a way

00:34:50.978 --> 00:34:53.349
creates an almost status group.
 

00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:55.389
You know each other. Right?
 

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:57.639
You recognize each other. Right?
 

00:34:57.639 --> 00:35:00.273
There are places where you hang
together.

00:35:00.273 --> 00:35:00.800
Right?
 

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.349
There are yuppie places.
 

00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:05.092
You look outside and you know
this is a yuppie bar,

00:35:05.092 --> 00:35:06.300
filled with yuppies.
 

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.480
This is the lifestyle by which
you have status.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:13.829
There are also,
of course, status privileges--

00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:18.365
which is ideal and material
goods, which is a consequence of

00:35:18.365 --> 00:35:27.539
you being in that status group,
rather than the source of it.

00:35:27.539 --> 00:35:31.014
And there are also specific
special employment

00:35:31.014 --> 00:35:34.027
opportunities,
if you belong to a status

00:35:34.027 --> 00:35:37.579
group, and it's being controlled
this way.

00:35:37.579 --> 00:35:40.730
I mean, the medical profession
is a very good example.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:45.523
And it's being actually debated
and questioned why on earth do

00:35:45.523 --> 00:35:50.239
we need a system in which people
have to have registered--

00:35:50.239 --> 00:35:53.880
do have to have a medical
degree in order to practice

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.510
medicine?
 

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.139
Right?
 

00:35:55.139 --> 00:35:58.418
Why on earth people do have to
have a law degree in order to

00:35:58.418 --> 00:36:00.864
appear in court and defend
somebody in court?

00:36:00.864 --> 00:36:01.420
Right?
 

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:10.239
These are kind of status group
barriers to enter the system.

00:36:10.239 --> 00:36:13.396
Well the market,
on the other hand,

00:36:13.396 --> 00:36:16.369
knows no personal distinction.
 

00:36:16.369 --> 00:36:19.675
On the market it matters
whether you are successful or

00:36:19.675 --> 00:36:20.797
you are a failure.
 

00:36:20.797 --> 00:36:21.360
Right?
 

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.440
And therefore if you have these
status group kind of privileges,

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.871
this is a limitation on the
functioning of the market.

00:36:28.871 --> 00:36:29.518
Right?
 

00:36:29.518 --> 00:36:33.561
And therefore stronger the
status groups are,

00:36:33.561 --> 00:36:39.440
it can be a hindrance of free
development of a market economy.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:44.599
And now an idea about caste and
ethnicity.

00:36:44.599 --> 00:36:49.896
He said if the boundaries
between status groups are

00:36:49.896 --> 00:36:55.934
particularly sharply drawn,
in that case we can talk about

00:36:55.934 --> 00:36:57.099
castes.
 

00:36:57.099 --> 00:36:59.855
The caste differences occur,
for instance,

00:36:59.855 --> 00:37:03.820
when there are prohibitions to
intermarry between castes.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:08.199
Lower castes are usually seen
as polluted, as dirty;

00:37:08.199 --> 00:37:13.132
you even cannot touch them,
or if you did touch a low class

00:37:13.132 --> 00:37:17.811
person, let's say in Indian
culture, you have to go some

00:37:17.811 --> 00:37:19.853
purification procedures.
 

00:37:19.853 --> 00:37:20.789
Right?
 

00:37:20.789 --> 00:37:25.590
And he said status
groups--segregation grows into

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:29.860
castes,
that transforms a horizontal

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:35.583
coexistence of ethnically
segregated groups into a

00:37:35.583 --> 00:37:38.619
vertical social system.
 

00:37:38.619 --> 00:37:41.527
This is also very
important--right?--his notion of

00:37:41.527 --> 00:37:42.239
ethnicity.
 

00:37:42.239 --> 00:37:47.476
It's a very innovative idea in
writing this around 1920,

00:37:47.476 --> 00:37:48.523
about this.
 

00:37:48.523 --> 00:37:49.380
Right?
 

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:54.840
The differences are held to be
ethnic, based on the belief that

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.628
it has something to do with
blood relations.

00:37:58.628 --> 00:37:59.510
Right?
 

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.018
He does not
believe--right?--that ethnic

00:38:02.018 --> 00:38:06.010
differences really have anything
to do with blood relations.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:10.599
You have ethic or racial
differences when there is a

00:38:10.599 --> 00:38:15.190
common belief that blood
relations do matter and are

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:17.619
socially consequential.
 

00:38:17.619 --> 00:38:19.940
He doesn't believe it is.
 

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:23.630
Now class and status compared.
 

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:26.539
I am sort of running out of
time;

00:38:26.539 --> 00:38:34.420
don't want to operate on--to do
too much on this.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:45.480
The point is--right?--that
there is some kind of stability

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:50.719
in status stratification.
 

00:38:50.719 --> 00:38:56.579
Class stratification is dynamic
and conflictuous.

00:38:56.579 --> 00:38:59.460
This is where his idea will
come from that,

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:03.789
that in fact,
class relationships are not

00:39:03.789 --> 00:39:08.119
becoming more antagonistic over
time,

00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:11.670
but is becoming less
antagonistic over time.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:14.215
But the point is,
as you can see,

00:39:14.215 --> 00:39:17.876
that the main point is that
there are two basic

00:39:17.876 --> 00:39:21.458
stratification systems:
one based on status or

00:39:21.458 --> 00:39:26.065
Stand,
and the other one is on class

00:39:26.065 --> 00:39:27.730
stratification.
 

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.454
Historical difference,
but there is also a subtype of

00:39:31.454 --> 00:39:35.181
stratification in a class
stratified society based on

00:39:35.181 --> 00:39:36.829
status differences.
 

00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:40.615
So what are--he makes a
distinction between different

00:39:40.615 --> 00:39:42.000
types of classes.
 

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.139
Let me just briefly rush
through of it.

00:39:45.139 --> 00:39:50.630
He does not negate that there
is actually a class based on

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:51.690
property.
 

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:55.626
There is actually--property
differences can be very

00:39:55.626 --> 00:40:00.510
substantial, as long as they are
operating in a marketplace.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:04.210
If your property can be sold or
bought--

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.650
which was not the case under
feudalism--

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:10.025
and if there is a labor market
which complements capital

00:40:10.025 --> 00:40:13.677
markets,
then differences in capital

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:17.869
markets is the source of
differences.

00:40:17.869 --> 00:40:21.360
 
 

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.929
But the most important
distinction is what he calls

00:40:24.929 --> 00:40:26.429
commercial classes.
 

00:40:26.429 --> 00:40:31.224
And commercial classes are
based--right?--on the market

00:40:31.224 --> 00:40:35.844
situation, and particularly
especially based on labor

00:40:35.844 --> 00:40:36.909
markets.
 

00:40:36.909 --> 00:40:40.320
And therefore the basic class
distinction for Weber,

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.820
in modern society,
is between management and

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:47.208
employees,
rather than owners of capital

00:40:47.208 --> 00:40:50.420
and owners of labor power;
unlike Marx.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:54.489
And that, I think,
is a very insightful argument,

00:40:54.489 --> 00:40:59.369
at least an important
qualification on Marx,

00:40:59.369 --> 00:41:03.422
or probably a useful
replacement of Marx with a

00:41:03.422 --> 00:41:08.268
better fitting theory to
understand modern societies.

00:41:08.268 --> 00:41:12.887
Okay, and then there are--he
introduces the notion of social

00:41:12.887 --> 00:41:13.670
classes.
 

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:17.202
There is a third type of class
in modern society,

00:41:17.202 --> 00:41:18.969
which is social class.
 

00:41:18.969 --> 00:41:21.119
And what is social class?
 

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:26.900
People are in a social class
situation when individual and

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:33.190
generational mobility is easy
and typical within that class.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:36.338
And then he said,
"Well what are social

00:41:36.338 --> 00:41:37.510
classes?"
 

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:40.820
And interestingly he said,
"Well these examples are--

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:45.193
working class is a social
class, the petit bourgeoisie is

00:41:45.193 --> 00:41:46.989
a social class."
 

00:41:46.989 --> 00:41:50.664
The basic argument here is
working class is not a

00:41:50.664 --> 00:41:52.119
commercial class.
 

00:41:52.119 --> 00:41:54.909
Working class--well he's
writing in the nineteenth

00:41:54.909 --> 00:41:55.480
century.
 

00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:00.182
But it's still to some extent
true in the United States today,

00:42:00.182 --> 00:42:02.650
probably the least so in the
U.S.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.809
than in other economies.
 

00:42:04.809 --> 00:42:12.079
Then being working class was
certainly very true in Europe,

00:42:12.079 --> 00:42:15.826
probably less so now,
but even during the second half

00:42:15.826 --> 00:42:19.789
of the twentieth century in
Italy and France there was a

00:42:19.789 --> 00:42:22.960
very strong working class
consciousness.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.018
You were proud of being working
class.

00:42:26.018 --> 00:42:26.632
In the U.S.
 

00:42:26.632 --> 00:42:28.637
the term working class hardly
exists.

00:42:28.637 --> 00:42:29.139
Right?
 

00:42:29.139 --> 00:42:32.056
We are talking about the
working people rather than the

00:42:32.056 --> 00:42:32.920
working class.
 

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:37.340
But in Italy or in France there
was a very strong identity of

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.541
being a working class--very
clearly identifiable lifestyle

00:42:41.541 --> 00:42:42.500
features.
 

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.759
Not that even,
in fact, in the United States

00:42:44.759 --> 00:42:47.351
you can't really--
you usually can tell,

00:42:47.351 --> 00:42:50.360
I think, with ninety percent
certainty,

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.856
if you walk into a
tavern--right?--who is a manual

00:42:54.856 --> 00:42:58.251
worker and who is not a manual
worker.

00:42:58.251 --> 00:42:59.170
Right?
 

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:02.536
The way how people behave,
the way how people dress,

00:43:02.536 --> 00:43:04.449
gives you a very good clue.
 

00:43:04.449 --> 00:43:08.331
And in France or in Italy,
to some extent even in the

00:43:08.331 --> 00:43:11.483
United States,
working class will say,

00:43:11.483 --> 00:43:14.498
"Well,
it was good enough for me to be

00:43:14.498 --> 00:43:15.190
a plumber.
 

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:18.360
Why on earth my son doesn't
want to be a plumber and

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.599
continue my business as a
plumber?

00:43:20.599 --> 00:43:22.630
That's good enough." Right?
 

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:27.559
If it was good enough for me,
should be good enough for my

00:43:27.559 --> 00:43:28.079
son.
 

00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:33.250
How he understands social class
as distinct from economic class.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:39.753
You become social class when
you will say--well you are in

00:43:39.753 --> 00:43:45.800
working class and your daughter
is dating a lawyer.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.704
Then you will say,
"Can't you find a decent

00:43:48.704 --> 00:43:49.940
working class guy?
 

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.199
You want to date with this
egghead?"

00:43:53.199 --> 00:43:55.793
Again, in the United States it
is much less common.

00:43:55.793 --> 00:43:56.210
Right?
 

00:43:56.210 --> 00:44:01.077
There is many more marital
mobility across class

00:44:01.077 --> 00:44:06.880
lines--much less so in Italy or
in France, even today.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.981
Anyway, this is social class,
but as you can see,

00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:14.119
social class in a way bringing
back the idea of status groups.

00:44:14.119 --> 00:44:16.733
It is a modern version of
status group,

00:44:16.733 --> 00:44:19.900
what is being constituted as a
social class.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:24.824
because it has a lot to do with
lifestyles, values,

00:44:24.824 --> 00:44:29.947
culture--right?--and typical
patterns of mobility and

00:44:29.947 --> 00:44:32.409
aspirations, as such.
 

00:44:32.409 --> 00:44:35.800
Well that's about it.
 

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:36.980
Thank you very much.
 

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:42.000

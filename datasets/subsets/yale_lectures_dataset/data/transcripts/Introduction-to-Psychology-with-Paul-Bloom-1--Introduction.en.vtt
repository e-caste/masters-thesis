00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.284
Professor Paul Bloom:
I'd like to welcome people to

00:03:43.284 --> 00:03:45.410
this course, Introduction to
Psychology.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.729
My name is Dr. Paul Bloom.
I'm professor of this course.

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:54.896
And what this is going to be is
a comprehensive introduction to

00:03:54.896 --> 00:03:59.833
the study of the human mind.
So, we are going to cover a

00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:03.449
very, very wide range of topics
including brains,

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.645
children, language,
sex, memory,

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.983
madness, disgust,
racism and love,

00:04:07.983 --> 00:04:10.862
and many others.
We're going to talk about

00:04:10.862 --> 00:04:13.727
things like the proper
explanation for differences

00:04:13.727 --> 00:04:17.663
between men and women;
the question of whether animals

00:04:17.663 --> 00:04:21.179
can learn language;
the puzzle of what grosses us

00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:23.556
out;
the problem of why some of us

00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:26.589
eat too much and what we could
do to stop;

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:30.000
the question of why people go
crazy in groups;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.269
research into whether you could
trust your childhood memories;

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:38.930
research into why some of us
get depressed and others don't.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.943
The style of this is there'll
be two lectures a week,

00:04:43.943 --> 00:04:48.877
as well as course readings.
Now, to do well in the course,

00:04:48.877 --> 00:04:53.010
you have to attend both the
lectures and do the readings.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.468
There will be some overlap.
In some cases,

00:04:55.468 --> 00:04:57.940
the lectures will be quite
linked to the readings.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.844
But there will be some parts of
the readings that will not find

00:05:00.844 --> 00:05:04.198
their way into the lectures,
and some lectures--some entire

00:05:04.198 --> 00:05:07.769
lectures that will not connect
at all to the readings.

00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:12.439
So, to pursue this course
properly you have to do both.

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:15.837
What this means is that if you
miss a class you need to get

00:05:15.837 --> 00:05:19.234
notes, and so you should get
them from a friend or from the

00:05:19.234 --> 00:05:23.523
person sitting next to you.
The slides are going to be made

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:26.416
available online.
So, one of the things you don't

00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:28.720
have to do is you don't have to
write this down.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.711
You take notes any way you
choose, but if you don't get

00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:34.259
anything on there it'll be
available online.

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.215
I'm going to post it in a
format which will be black and

00:05:37.215 --> 00:05:40.386
white and easy to print out so
you don't have to worry about

00:05:40.386 --> 00:05:43.281
this.
But again, attending to the

00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:47.569
slides is not a substitute for
attending class.

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.173
There's a textbook,
Peter Gray's Psychology,

00:05:51.173 --> 00:05:55.930
5th edition, and there's also a
collection of short readings,

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.050
The Norton Reader edited by
Gary Marcus.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.925
It's an excellent textbook;
it's an excellent collection,

00:06:01.925 --> 00:06:05.786
and you should get them both.
They're available at Labyrinth

00:06:05.786 --> 00:06:09.209
bookstore on York Street or you
get them online.

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:12.303
I should note that last time I
taught the course I used the

00:06:12.303 --> 00:06:15.318
Marcus Reader,
and when Professor Marvin Chun

00:06:15.318 --> 00:06:18.777
taught his course last semester
he used Peter Gray's 5^(th)

00:06:18.777 --> 00:06:21.319
edition textbook.
So, there may be a lot of used

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.806
copies floating around.
You should feel free to try to

00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:28.279
get one of those.
The evaluation goes like this.

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.769
There is a Midterm and there is
a Final.

00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:33.491
The Final will not be held in
the exam period,

00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:35.910
because I like to take long
vacations.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.990
It will be held the last day of
class.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.928
The exams will be multiple
choice and short answer,

00:06:41.928 --> 00:06:44.279
fill in the blank,
that sort of thing.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.994
Prior to the exams I will post
previous exams online,

00:06:47.994 --> 00:06:52.209
so you have a feeling for how
these exams work and so on.

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:54.410
There will also be review
sessions.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.085
Starting at the beginning of
the third week of class – that

00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:01.577
is not next week but the week
after – on each Monday I'm

00:07:01.577 --> 00:07:05.069
going to put up a brief question
or set of questions,

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.530
which you have to answer and
your answers need to be sent to

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.165
your teaching fellow.
And you'll be given a teaching

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:14.680
fellow, assigned one,
by Friday.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.439
This is not meant to be
difficult.

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:19.860
It's not meant to be more than
five, ten minutes of work,

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.036
but the point of the
question--15,20 minutes of work,

00:07:23.036 --> 00:07:26.762
but the point of the question
is to motivate people to keep up

00:07:26.762 --> 00:07:29.449
with the material and do the
readings.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.670
These questions will be marked
pass, fail.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.113
I expect most everybody could
pass all of the questions but

00:07:35.113 --> 00:07:38.199
it's just to keep you on track
and keep you going.

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.830
There is a book review,
a short book review,

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.889
to be written towards near the
end of the class.

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:46.440
I'll give details about that
later on in the semester.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.829
And there's also an
experimental participation

00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:51.803
requirement, and next week I'll
hand out a piece of paper

00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:55.466
describing the requirement.
The point of the requirement is

00:07:55.466 --> 00:07:58.459
to give you all experience
actually seeing what

00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:02.427
psychological research is about
as well as to give us hundreds

00:08:02.427 --> 00:08:05.160
of subjects to do our
experiments on.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.400
The issue sometimes comes up as
to how to do well in the course.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.890
Here's how to do well.
Attend all the classes.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.380
Keep up with the readings.
Ideally, keep up with the

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.139
readings before you come to
class.

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:24.628
And one thing I would strongly
suggest is to form some sort of

00:08:24.628 --> 00:08:27.259
study groups,
either formally or informally.

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:30.883
Have people you could talk to
when the--prior to the exams

00:08:30.883 --> 00:08:33.490
or--she's patting somebody next
to her.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:39.860
I hope you know him.
And in fact,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.381
what I'm going to do,
not this class because it's

00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:44.817
shopping period.
I don't know who's coming next

00:08:44.817 --> 00:08:47.309
class, or what but I'll set up a
few minutes prior,

00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:51.107
at the beginning of the class,
for people just to introduce

00:08:51.107 --> 00:08:55.167
themselves to the person next to
them so they have some sort of

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:58.903
resource in the class.
Now, this is a large class,

00:08:58.903 --> 00:09:02.820
and if you don't do anything
about it, it can be very

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.460
anonymous.
And some of you may choose to

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.980
pursue it that way and that's
totally fine.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.105
But what I would suggest you do
is establish some contact with

00:09:12.105 --> 00:09:15.960
us, either with me or with any
of the teaching fellows,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.340
and I'll introduce the teaching
fellows sometime next week.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.493
You could talk to us at the
beginning or at the end of

00:09:22.493 --> 00:09:24.294
class.
Unless there are special

00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:26.667
circumstances,
I always try to come at least

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:29.260
ten minutes early,
and I am willing to stay late

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.768
to talk to people.
You could come by during my

00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:33.558
office hours,
which are on the syllabus,

00:09:33.558 --> 00:09:36.220
and you could send me e-mail
and set up an appointment.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.397
I'm very willing to talk to
students about intellectual

00:09:39.397 --> 00:09:41.809
ideas, about course problems and
so on.

00:09:41.809 --> 00:09:44.900
And if you see me at some point
just on campus,

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.932
you could introduce yourself
and I'd like to meet people from

00:09:48.932 --> 00:09:51.710
this class.
So, again, I want to stress you

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.679
have the option of staying
anonymous in this class,

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:58.212
but you also have the option of
seeking out and making some sort

00:09:58.212 --> 00:10:01.210
of contact with us.
Okay.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.720
That's the formal stuff of the
course.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.554
What's this course about?
Unlike a lot of other courses,

00:10:08.554 --> 00:10:12.907
some people come to Intro
Psychology with some unusual

00:10:12.907 --> 00:10:17.482
motivations.
Maybe you're crazy and hope to

00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:21.992
become less crazy.
Maybe you want to learn how to

00:10:21.992 --> 00:10:24.784
study better,
improve your sex life,

00:10:24.784 --> 00:10:28.852
interpret your dreams,
and win friends and influence

00:10:28.852 --> 00:10:31.961
people.
Those are not necessarily bad

00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:36.486
reasons to take this course and,
with the exception of the sex

00:10:36.486 --> 00:10:38.540
part,
this course might actually help

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.190
you out with some of these
things.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.676
The study of scientific
psychology has a lot of insights

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:47.415
of real world relevance to real
problems that we face in our

00:10:47.415 --> 00:10:50.151
everyday lives.
And I'm going to try--and when

00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:53.265
these issues come up--I'm going
to try to stress them and make

00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:56.124
you try to think about the
extent to which the laboratory

00:10:56.124 --> 00:10:59.187
research I'll be talking about
can affect your everyday life:

00:10:59.187 --> 00:11:01.809
how you study,
how you interact with people,

00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:04.909
how you might try to persuade
somebody of something else,

00:11:04.909 --> 00:11:07.240
what sort of therapy works best
for you.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:14.227
But the general goals of this
course are actually I think even

00:11:14.227 --> 00:11:19.773
more interesting than that.
What I want to do is provide a

00:11:19.773 --> 00:11:24.294
state of the art introduction to
the most important topic that

00:11:24.294 --> 00:11:27.457
there is: us.
How the human mind works,

00:11:27.457 --> 00:11:30.700
how we think,
what makes us what we are.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.539
And we'll be approaching this
from a range of directions.

00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:36.903
So, traditionally,
psychology is often broken up

00:11:36.903 --> 00:11:40.909
into the following--into five
sub-areas: Neuroscience,

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:45.190
which is the study of the mind
by looking at the brain;

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.425
developmental,
which is the area which I focus

00:11:48.425 --> 00:11:52.666
mostly on, which is trying to
learn about how people develop

00:11:52.666 --> 00:11:55.955
and grow and learn;
cognitive, which is the one

00:11:55.955 --> 00:11:59.470
term of the five that might be
unfamiliar to some of you,

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.630
but it refers to a sort of
computational approach to

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.294
studying the mind,
often viewing the mind on

00:12:05.294 --> 00:12:08.889
analogy with a computer and
looking at how people do things

00:12:08.889 --> 00:12:12.614
like understand language,
recognize objects,

00:12:12.614 --> 00:12:16.000
play games, and so on.
There is social,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.108
which is the study of how
people act in groups,

00:12:19.108 --> 00:12:21.539
how people act with other
people.

00:12:21.539 --> 00:12:24.068
And there is clinical,
which is maybe the aspect of

00:12:24.068 --> 00:12:26.951
psychology that people think of
immediately when they hear

00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:29.395
psychology,
which is the study of mental

00:12:29.395 --> 00:12:32.392
health and mental illness.
And we'll be covering all of

00:12:32.392 --> 00:12:34.876
those areas.
We'll also be covering a set of

00:12:34.876 --> 00:12:37.957
related areas.
I am convinced that you cannot

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:42.769
study the mind solely by looking
at the discipline of psychology.

00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:46.628
The discipline of psychology
spills over to issues of how the

00:12:46.628 --> 00:12:49.875
mind has evolved.
Economics and game theory are

00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:53.648
now essential tools for
understanding human thought and

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:57.629
human behavior--those issues
connecting to philosophy,

00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:59.527
computer science,
anthropology,

00:12:59.527 --> 00:13:02.879
literature, theology,
and many, many other domains.

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:08.419
So, this course will be wide
ranging in that sense.

00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:11.940
At this point I've been
speaking in generalities so I

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.206
want to close this introductory
class by giving five examples of

00:13:16.206 --> 00:13:19.049
the sorts of topics we'll be
covering.

00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:24.217
And I'll start with the topic
that we'll be covering next week

00:13:24.217 --> 00:13:27.830
on Monday – the brain.
This is a brain.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.245
In fact, it's a specific
person's brain,

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:36.326
and what's interesting about
the brain is that little white

00:13:36.326 --> 00:13:39.410
mark there.
It's her brain.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.756
It's Terri Schiavo's brain.
You recognize her more from

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:47.477
pictures like that.
And what a case like this,

00:13:47.477 --> 00:13:52.229
where somebody is in a coma,
is without consciousness as a

00:13:52.229 --> 00:13:57.230
result of damage to the brain,
is a stark illustration of the

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.987
physical nature of mental life.
The physical basis for

00:14:00.987 --> 00:14:04.379
everything that we normally hold
dear, like free will,

00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:06.825
consciousness,
morality and emotions,

00:14:06.825 --> 00:14:09.950
and that's what we'll begin the
course with,

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:16.157
talking about how a physical
thing can give rise to mental

00:14:16.157 --> 00:14:18.919
life.
We'll talk a lot about children.

00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:21.929
This is actually a specific
child.

00:14:21.929 --> 00:14:25.032
It's my son,
Zachary, my younger son,

00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:29.170
dressed up as Spider-Man,
but it is Halloween.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.440
No, it's not Halloween.
Oh.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.440
Well, there's more to say about
that [laughter].

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.345
I study child development for a
living and I'm interested in

00:14:40.345 --> 00:14:43.059
several questions.
So, one question is just the

00:14:43.059 --> 00:14:46.393
question of development.
Everybody in this room can

00:14:46.393 --> 00:14:50.634
speak and understand English.
Everybody in this room has some

00:14:50.634 --> 00:14:53.931
understanding of how the world
works, how physical things

00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:56.401
behave.
Everybody in this room has some

00:14:56.401 --> 00:14:59.679
understanding of other people,
and how people behave.

00:14:59.679 --> 00:15:02.752
And the question that
preoccupies developmental

00:15:02.752 --> 00:15:06.559
psychologists is how do we come
to have this knowledge,

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:10.789
and in particular,
how much of it is hard-wired,

00:15:10.789 --> 00:15:14.552
built-in, innate.
And how much of it is the

00:15:14.552 --> 00:15:17.096
product of culture,
of language,

00:15:17.096 --> 00:15:21.109
of schooling?
And developmental psychologists

00:15:21.109 --> 00:15:26.334
use many ingenious methods to
try to pull these apart and try

00:15:26.334 --> 00:15:31.820
to figure out what are the basic
components of human nature.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.559
There's also the question of
continuity.

00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:40.175
To what extent is Zachary,
at that age,

00:15:40.175 --> 00:15:45.945
going to be that way forever?
To what extent is your fate

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.901
sealed?
To what extent could--if I were

00:15:48.901 --> 00:15:53.472
to meet you when you were five
years old I could describe the

00:15:53.472 --> 00:15:57.485
way you are now?
The poet William Wordsworth

00:15:57.485 --> 00:16:03.375
wrote, "The child is father to
the man," and what this means is

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:08.980
that you can see within every
child the adult he or she will

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.249
become.
We will look and ask the

00:16:12.249 --> 00:16:16.720
question whether this is true.
Is it true for your personality?

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.966
Is it true for your interests?
Is it true for your

00:16:19.966 --> 00:16:24.476
intelligence?
Another question having to do

00:16:24.476 --> 00:16:29.779
with development is what makes
us the way we are?

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:32.389
We're different in a lot of
ways.

00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:35.792
The people in this room differ
according to their taste in

00:16:35.792 --> 00:16:37.735
food.
They differ according to their

00:16:37.735 --> 00:16:40.164
IQs;
whether they're aggressive or

00:16:40.164 --> 00:16:42.417
shy;
whether they're attracted to

00:16:42.417 --> 00:16:44.630
males, females,
both or neither;

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:49.901
whether they are good at music;
whether they are politically

00:16:49.901 --> 00:16:53.629
liberal or conservative.
Why are we different?

00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:56.429
What's the explanation for why
we're different?

00:16:56.429 --> 00:16:59.407
And again, this could be
translated in terms of a

00:16:59.407 --> 00:17:01.639
question of genes and
environment.

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:05.339
To what extent are things the
result of the genes we possess?

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:09.112
To what extent are our
individual natures the result of

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:12.300
how we were raised?
And to what extent are they

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.039
best explained in terms of an
interaction?

00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:17.546
One common theory,
for instance,

00:17:17.546 --> 00:17:20.700
is that we are shaped by our
parents.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:26.461
This was best summarized most
famously by the British poet

00:17:26.461 --> 00:17:31.647
Philip Larkin who wrote,
They mess you up,

00:17:31.647 --> 00:17:36.557
your mum and dad.
They may not mean to but they

00:17:36.557 --> 00:17:38.961
do.
They fill you with the faults

00:17:38.961 --> 00:17:41.470
they had
And add some extra just for

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.340
you.
Is he right?

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.968
It's very controversial.
You-- It's been a series of--a

00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:52.114
huge controversy in the popular
culture to the extent of which

00:17:52.114 --> 00:17:56.056
parents matter and this is an
issue which will preoccupy us

00:17:56.056 --> 00:17:59.960
for much of the course.
A different question:

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.832
What makes somebody attractive?
And this can be asked at all

00:18:04.832 --> 00:18:08.739
sorts of levels but a simple
level is what makes for a pretty

00:18:08.739 --> 00:18:10.695
face?
So, these are,

00:18:10.695 --> 00:18:15.309
according to ratings,
very attractive faces.

00:18:15.309 --> 00:18:17.539
They are not the faces of real
people.

00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:21.788
What's on the screen are
computer generated faces of a

00:18:21.788 --> 00:18:26.517
Caucasian male and a Caucasian
female who don't exist in the

00:18:26.517 --> 00:18:29.531
real world.
But through using this sort of

00:18:29.531 --> 00:18:32.369
computer generation,
and then asking people what

00:18:32.369 --> 00:18:35.520
they think of this face,
what they think of that face,

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.613
scientists have come to some
sense as to what really makes a

00:18:38.613 --> 00:18:42.150
face attractive,
both within cultures and across

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.476
cultures.
And that's something which

00:18:44.476 --> 00:18:47.893
we're going to devote some time
to when we talk about social

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:51.079
behavior, and in particular,
when we talk about sex.

00:18:51.079 --> 00:18:54.454
Not all attractiveness,
not all beauty of course,

00:18:54.454 --> 00:18:58.175
is linked to sex.
So, pandas for instance,

00:18:58.175 --> 00:19:01.852
like this panda,
are notoriously cute,

00:19:01.852 --> 00:19:07.019
and I don't have anything to
say about it really.

00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:12.640
It's just a cute picture
[laughter].

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.034
Morality is extremely central
to our lives,

00:19:16.034 --> 00:19:19.832
and a deep question,
which we will struggle with

00:19:19.832 --> 00:19:24.363
throughout most of the course,
is the question of good and

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:28.155
evil, evil and good.
These three pictures exemplify

00:19:28.155 --> 00:19:31.948
different sorts of evil.
What you could call

00:19:31.948 --> 00:19:37.786
institutional evil by somebody
behaving cruelly toward somebody

00:19:37.786 --> 00:19:40.431
else,
perhaps not due to malice but

00:19:40.431 --> 00:19:43.039
because of the situation that
she's in.

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:46.919
It has picture of Osama bin
Laden, a mass murderer or driven

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:49.476
by political cause?
And then there's this guy on

00:19:49.476 --> 00:19:51.070
the bottom.
Anybody know who he is?

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.710
Ted Bundy.
Who got that?

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.190
Film that man [laughter].
No.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.454
Ted Bundy, exactly,
and that's before we get into

00:20:03.454 --> 00:20:06.829
the technical stuff like
crazy-evil,

00:20:06.829 --> 00:20:12.261
and we're going to have to come
to terms with why some people

00:20:12.261 --> 00:20:15.561
are like that.
And again, the same situation

00:20:15.561 --> 00:20:19.525
comes up.
Is it part of your nature to be

00:20:19.525 --> 00:20:26.176
good or bad or is it largely due
to the situation that you fall

00:20:26.176 --> 00:20:29.048
in?
And there's a lot of some quite

00:20:29.048 --> 00:20:32.930
spectacular experiments that try
to tease that apart.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:37.650
If we're going to talk about
evil, we should also talk about

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.547
good.
These are pictures of two

00:20:41.547 --> 00:20:47.554
notoriously good men,
Oskar Schindler and Paul

00:20:47.554 --> 00:20:52.404
Rusesabagina,
each who at different times in

00:20:52.404 --> 00:20:57.833
history saved the lives of many,
many people at great risk to

00:20:57.833 --> 00:21:01.713
themselves.
Schindler in the Holocaust,

00:21:01.713 --> 00:21:06.648
and then the other guy,
in – and I can't pronounce

00:21:06.648 --> 00:21:10.519
his name – Rusesabagina,
in Rwanda.

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:15.220
And they both had real good
movies made about them.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.663
But what's interesting with
these cases is you couldn't have

00:21:19.663 --> 00:21:23.579
predicted ahead of time that
they would be heroes.

00:21:23.579 --> 00:21:28.668
And one personal issue within
any of us is what would we do in

00:21:28.668 --> 00:21:33.550
such situations?
Finally, throughout this course

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:39.014
we will discuss mental illness.
Now, towards the end of the

00:21:39.014 --> 00:21:42.891
class I want to devote a full
week to discussing major

00:21:42.891 --> 00:21:45.890
disorders like depression and
anxiety,

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:49.230
because of their profound
social importance.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.420
Such disorders are reasonably
common in college students.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.430
Many people in this room are
currently suffering from a mood

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.150
disorder, an anxiety disorder or
both,

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.663
and I won't ask for a show of
hands but I know a lot of people

00:22:04.663 --> 00:22:09.400
in this room are on some form of
medication for this disorder.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.258
And we'll discuss the current
research and why people get

00:22:13.258 --> 00:22:17.529
these disorders and what's the
best way to make them better.

00:22:17.529 --> 00:22:22.039
But I also have a weakness for
the less common mental disorders

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:26.475
that I think tell us something
really interesting about mental

00:22:26.475 --> 00:22:29.065
life.
So, when we talk about memory,

00:22:29.065 --> 00:22:31.774
for instance,
we'll talk about disorders in

00:22:31.774 --> 00:22:34.386
memory,
including some disorders that

00:22:34.386 --> 00:22:38.251
keep you from forming new
memories as well as disorders of

00:22:38.251 --> 00:22:40.759
amnesia where you forget the
past.

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:45.838
And these are extraordinarily
interesting for all sorts of

00:22:45.838 --> 00:22:47.853
reasons.
Early in the course,

00:22:47.853 --> 00:22:50.214
in fact I think next week,
we will discuss,

00:22:50.214 --> 00:22:53.988
no, later on in the course,
in the middle of the semester,

00:22:53.988 --> 00:22:57.400
we will discuss an amazing case
of Phineas Gage.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.259
Phineas Gage was a construction
worker about 100 years ago.

00:23:01.259 --> 00:23:05.807
Due to an explosion,
a metal pipe went through his

00:23:05.807 --> 00:23:10.009
head like so.
Miraculously, he was not killed.

00:23:10.009 --> 00:23:13.110
In fact, his friends--it went
through his head,

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:17.289
went--ended up 100 feet away,
covered with brains and blood.

00:23:17.289 --> 00:23:20.079
And Phineas Gage sat down and
went, "uh, oh."

00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:24.785
And then on the way to the
hospital they stopped by a pub

00:23:24.785 --> 00:23:28.623
to have some cider.
He was not blind,

00:23:28.623 --> 00:23:33.014
he was not deaf,
he was not retarded,

00:23:33.014 --> 00:23:37.650
but something else happened to
him.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.720
He lost his sense of right and
wrong.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:46.334
He lost his control.
He used to be a hard-working

00:23:46.334 --> 00:23:49.396
family man.
After the accident he lost all

00:23:49.396 --> 00:23:51.509
of that.
He couldn't hold a job.

00:23:51.509 --> 00:23:53.569
He couldn't stay faithful to
his wife.

00:23:53.569 --> 00:23:57.130
He couldn't speak for five
minutes without cursing.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.200
He got into fights.
He got into brawls.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.789
He got drunk.
He lost his control.

00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:05.276
He ended up on a circus
sideshow traveling through the

00:24:05.276 --> 00:24:09.289
country with the big steel pipe
that went through his head.

00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:13.649
And this is again an
extraordinary example of how the

00:24:13.649 --> 00:24:18.168
brain can give rise to the mind,
and how things that go wrong

00:24:18.168 --> 00:24:21.029
with the brain can affect you in
a serious way.

00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:24.664
We'll discuss cases of multiple
personality disorder,

00:24:24.664 --> 00:24:27.880
where people have more than one
personality.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.914
And also, discuss the debate
over whether such cases are true

00:24:31.914 --> 00:24:33.981
or not;
whether they could be taken as

00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:36.903
a real phenomena or a made-up
phenomena, which is--there is a

00:24:36.903 --> 00:24:41.471
matter of a lot of controversy.
And then, we'll even discuss

00:24:41.471 --> 00:24:45.630
some rarer cases like Capgras
syndrome.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:50.125
Capgras syndrome is typically
– there's hundreds of cases,

00:24:50.125 --> 00:24:54.369
not many – hundreds of cases.
It's typically the result of

00:24:54.369 --> 00:24:57.518
some sort of stroke,
and what happens to you is very

00:24:57.518 --> 00:25:01.835
specific.
You develop a particular

00:25:01.835 --> 00:25:07.049
delusion, like it's getting dark
.

00:25:07.049 --> 00:25:14.420
And the delusion is that the
people you love the most have

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:19.207
been replaced.
They've been replaced by aliens

00:25:19.207 --> 00:25:23.941
or robots – thank you – by
Martians, by CIA agents,

00:25:23.941 --> 00:25:27.009
by trained actors and
actresses.

00:25:27.009 --> 00:25:33.357
But the people--But the idea
is, the people you care for the

00:25:33.357 --> 00:25:39.101
most you believe are gone.
And this could lead to tragic

00:25:39.101 --> 00:25:42.529
consequences.
Capgras syndrome is associated

00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:45.059
with a very high level of
violence.

00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:49.195
One man in Australia a couple
of years ago was under the

00:25:49.195 --> 00:25:53.481
delusion that his father was
replaced with a robot and cut

00:25:53.481 --> 00:25:57.292
off his head.
A related disorder involving

00:25:57.292 --> 00:26:02.900
the very same parts of the brain
is called Cotard's syndrome.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.079
And Cotard's syndrome is you
believe that you're dead;

00:26:07.079 --> 00:26:10.080
you are persuaded that you're
dead.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.400
You're walking around.
You know you're walking around.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.871
And you know that there are
people around,

00:26:13.871 --> 00:26:17.613
but you think that you're dead.
And what's striking about these

00:26:17.613 --> 00:26:21.178
is--it's not--these are not just
sort of big, screwy problems of

00:26:21.178 --> 00:26:23.327
messed up people.
Rather, they're

00:26:23.327 --> 00:26:27.396
located--they're related at a
pinpoint level to certain parts

00:26:27.396 --> 00:26:30.373
of your brain.
And we're going to talk about

00:26:30.373 --> 00:26:34.019
the best modern theories as to
why these syndromes occur.

00:26:34.019 --> 00:26:36.839
Now, the reason to be
interested in them,

00:26:36.839 --> 00:26:39.730
again, is not because they're
frequent.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.493
They aren't.
And it's not because of some

00:26:42.493 --> 00:26:44.490
sort of gruesome,
morbid curiosity.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:51.475
Rather, by looking at extreme
cases, they can help us best

00:26:51.475 --> 00:26:56.293
understand normal life.
Often by looking at extremes it

00:26:56.293 --> 00:26:59.347
throws into sharp contrast
things we naturally take for

00:26:59.347 --> 00:27:01.521
granted.
The issue of psychopathy,

00:27:01.521 --> 00:27:04.190
of people who,
either due to brain damage or

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:08.184
because they are born that way,
have no moral understanding,

00:27:08.184 --> 00:27:12.559
can help us cope with questions
of free will and responsibility;

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:15.066
of the relationship or
difference between mental

00:27:15.066 --> 00:27:17.923
illness and evil.
Multiple personality cases

00:27:17.923 --> 00:27:21.609
force us to address the question
of what is a self.

00:27:21.609 --> 00:27:25.833
To what extent are all of us
composed of multiple people,

00:27:25.833 --> 00:27:30.509
and to what extent are we a
single unified person over time?

00:27:30.509 --> 00:27:34.689
Cases like Capgras are
important because they tell us

00:27:34.689 --> 00:27:38.633
about how we see the world.
They tell us for instance that

00:27:38.633 --> 00:27:41.698
there is a difference between
recognizing something in the

00:27:41.698 --> 00:27:44.710
sense that you could name it,
and knowing what it is.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:49.316
And so, by studying these
abnormal cases we could get some

00:27:49.316 --> 00:27:53.264
insight into regular life.
So, that's the end of the

00:27:53.264 --> 00:27:55.690
illustration of the example
topics.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:28:00.874
The syllabus lists many more.
I'll end by telling you that

00:28:00.874 --> 00:28:05.631
there's a lot of stuff that
we'll be talking about,

00:28:05.631 --> 00:28:10.769
that I want to talk about,
that I am not expert in.

00:28:10.769 --> 00:28:14.400
And fortunately,
there is a community at Yale of

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.029
the best scholars and teachers
on the planet.

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:21.942
And so, it would be a shame for
me not to use them to cover some

00:28:21.942 --> 00:28:25.994
of these issues.
And so, I'm going to include

00:28:25.994 --> 00:28:29.836
four guest lecturers.
The first one is Dr.

00:28:29.836 --> 00:28:33.909
Marvin Chun who teaches the
Introduction to Psychology

00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:37.289
course in the fall and is my
competition.

00:28:37.289 --> 00:28:40.547
And he's going to give an
amazing lecture on cognitive

00:28:40.547 --> 00:28:42.821
neuroscience,
especially the cognitive

00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:44.420
neuroscience of faces.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:49.871
Dr.
Susan Nolen-Hoeksema is the

00:28:49.871 --> 00:28:53.690
world's authority on depression,
and in particular,

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.445
on sex differences and
depression, and she's going to

00:28:56.445 --> 00:28:58.990
talk about this towards the end
of the course.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:05.122
Kelly Brownell is going to
talk--is head of the Rudd

00:29:05.122 --> 00:29:09.649
Center, focuses on obesity,
eating disorders,

00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:12.950
dieting, and he'll talk about
the psychology of food.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.632
And finally,
Dr.

00:29:14.632 --> 00:29:18.558
Peter Salovey,
Dean of Yale College,

00:29:18.558 --> 00:29:24.392
is going to come to us on
Valentine's Day and tell us

00:29:24.392 --> 00:29:30.450
everything he knows about the
mysteries of love.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.812
All of these details are in the
syllabus and I'll stick around

00:29:33.812 --> 00:29:37.000
and answer questions.
Hope to see you next week.

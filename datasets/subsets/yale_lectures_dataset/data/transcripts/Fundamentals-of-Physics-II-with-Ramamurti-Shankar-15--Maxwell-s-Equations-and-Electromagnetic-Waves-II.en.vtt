00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.314
Prof: Okay,
this is the final lecture on

00:00:05.314 --> 00:00:06.750
electromagnetism.
 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.293
When you come back from the
break we will start doing

00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:12.080
optics.
 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.250
Of course you know by now
that's really electromagnetism,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.094
but it's going to be somewhat
easier on your imagination

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:22.660
because it doesn't involve many
abstract things,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.950
pretty concrete things.
 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.434
Then it'll take a turn for the
worse when we do quantum

00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:31.983
mechanics, but I think the
mathematics of that should be

00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:33.080
quite simple.
 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.179
Before you do that you should
make sure you know all about

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.333
elementary complex numbers like
what is e^(i)

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.530
^(θ).
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.850
You should get that completely
into your system.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.902
It's going to be all about
that, then very elementary

00:00:46.902 --> 00:00:49.240
calculus, just one variable.
 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.490
So last time I told you that if
you want to solve Maxwell's

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.033
equation in free space you can
write down any function you want

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:00.564
for
E and B that

00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:03.259
satisfy the four Maxwell
equations.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:08.253
Two involve surface integrals,
and two involve line integrals,

00:01:08.253 --> 00:01:11.610
and the answer we got looked
like this.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.510
This is x,
y and z.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.069
The electric field is going to
point that way,

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.269
magnetic field is going to
point that way,

00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:25.653
and the functional form E
was k (k is

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:28.498
unit vector in the z
direction)

00:01:28.498 --> 00:01:32.420
E_0sin(ky -
ωt),

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:41.712
and B was
iB_0sin(ky -

00:01:41.712 --> 00:01:44.810
ωt).
 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.827
When you take this assumed form
with this y and this

00:01:48.827 --> 00:01:51.390
t dependence you will
find,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.080
as written, they automatically
satisfy the surface integral,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.777
and the surface integral of
these fields on any tiny cube

00:01:58.777 --> 00:01:59.569
will be 0.
 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.108
When you do line integrals you
can take a loop in this plane,

00:02:03.108 --> 00:02:04.430
and that plane,
and the third plane,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.174
and you fool around you get
some additional constraints

00:02:07.174 --> 00:02:09.482
which I derived,
but I don't want to do that

00:02:09.482 --> 00:02:09.830
again.
 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.495
But the conditions you derive
are that ω should

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:17.580
be equal to k times
c,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.180
and remember the velocity of
light emerged at this following

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.508
combination.
 

00:02:24.508 --> 00:02:29.470
Then you will find the magnetic
field should be electric field

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.258
divided by c.
 

00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:35.853
These are the two conditions
you get from writing the two

00:02:35.853 --> 00:02:36.508
other.
 

00:02:36.508 --> 00:02:37.960
There are three equations for
loops.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.021
One of them is trivially
satisfied 0 = 0,

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.090
the others give you this.
 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.430
Now I want you to be able to at
least visualize these fields.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.750
You can write them on a piece
of paper, but E is not

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.628
the letter E.
 

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:53.120
E stands for something
physical.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.610
So what do these things do?
 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.288
First of all what is k
and what is ω?

00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:02.637
I realize that some of you are
not familiar with what k

00:03:02.637 --> 00:03:03.680
and ω mean.
 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.189
First of all you know it's a
periodic function in y at

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:08.770
fixed t,
if you like,

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.169
because sine of anything is
periodic.

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:15.515
That means at a given time if
you take a snapshot of this

00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:19.199
E it'll be oscillating as
you vary y.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.401
And at a given point in space,
if you study it as a function

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:25.131
of time,
it'll be also oscillating in

00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:28.710
time with an angular frequency
ω.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.342
So let me relate these
quantities to more familiar

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:33.008
things.
 

00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:38.764
If the wave looks like this,
and E is going to point

00:03:38.764 --> 00:03:42.518
in that direction,
you know that if you go a full

00:03:42.518 --> 00:03:44.910
wavelength you come back to
where you are.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.050
So let's call the wavelength
λ.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.834
It's clear then whatever
happens at 0 happens at

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:51.720
λ.
 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.375
At zero, ky is 0,
at λ,

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:56.440
ky should be 2Π.
 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.824
When you go a distance lambda
it should be equal to a 2Π

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:02.658
change.
 

00:04:02.658 --> 00:04:06.270
So λ,
which is more familiar to you

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.232
as the wavelength,
is the reciprocal up to the

00:04:10.232 --> 00:04:13.490
factor of 2Π
of this k.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.439
k is called the wave
number.

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:22.483
The bigger the k the
more rapidly the wave

00:04:22.483 --> 00:04:23.579
oscillates.
 

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:28.033
That is bigger the λ
the long wavelength means more

00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:30.300
slowly the wave oscillates.
 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.851
Similarly you can come to the
second guy and you can ask

00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:37.170
yourself--let me continue.
 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.819
So that's what E is.
 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.471
B, again,
is a function of space at a

00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:44.420
given time if you draw it,
but the B vector's

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.401
pointing this way,
so it'll look like this,

00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:57.350
and you can keep repeating
this.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.870
So E is going back.
 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.290
So now this is the thing to
understand with this graph.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.064
You can see this graph,
but you should know what it

00:05:04.064 --> 00:05:04.509
means.
 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:09.894
This whole graph describes the
situation at one given time only

00:05:09.894 --> 00:05:12.759
at points on the y-axis.
 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.050
I've drawn it only at points on
the y-axis.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.800
So this arrow,
even though it sticks out here

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.750
and there, is not talking about
a whole region.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.300
It's talking about that one
point.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.550
For example,
at this one point the electric

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.069
field points this way and has
that magnitude.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.202
At this point the electric
field points down and has that

00:05:30.202 --> 00:05:32.180
magnitude,
and the magnetic field points

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.432
away from the board,
here the magnetic field into

00:05:34.432 --> 00:05:36.110
the board and away from the
board,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.319
okay?
 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.690
That's the situation at one
time.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.529
Then you can ask yourself what
happens later.

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:45.779
You can do it in two ways.
 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.055
First of all let me tell you
the relation between

00:05:48.055 --> 00:05:49.810
ω and the time
period.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.244
If you wait a full time period
everything should come back to

00:05:53.244 --> 00:05:55.704
where it was,
so the time period T by

00:05:55.704 --> 00:05:57.879
definition will be this
condition.

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:04.088
Therefore, the time period that
you guys are all familiar with

00:06:04.088 --> 00:06:08.668
is also related to
ω by a similar

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:09.889
formula.
 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:15.420
So one way to write this wave
that is in terms of things

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.853
you're more familiar with would
be to say it looks like

00:06:20.853 --> 00:06:25.077
E_0
sin(2Πy/λ

00:06:25.077 --> 00:06:27.290
- 2Πt/T).
 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.242
This is completely equivalent
to what I wrote because these

00:06:30.242 --> 00:06:32.891
are the definitions of
ω and k in

00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:35.029
terms of λ and
T.

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.202
Maybe writing it this way is
more transparent - that if you

00:06:38.202 --> 00:06:40.829
add a λ
to y on the top,

00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:43.218
if you say y goes to
y λ

00:06:43.218 --> 00:06:44.889
you're adding a 2Π.
 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:47.747
If you add capital T to
small t upstairs you're

00:06:47.747 --> 00:06:48.889
subtracting the 2Π.
 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:49.850
That doesn't matter.
 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:55.158
This shows you the periodicity
in space of λ and

00:06:55.158 --> 00:06:57.769
in time of capital T.
 

00:06:57.769 --> 00:07:00.461
You can also write
ω as

00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:03.232
2Π/T,
but 1/T is the

00:07:03.232 --> 00:07:04.310
frequency.
 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.718
This is what we normally think
of as frequency,

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:08.759
so many hertz,
megahertz or whatever.

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:09.980
That's the frequency.
 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.009
The angular frequency omega we
use is 2Π times that,

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:17.266
because every time the thing
completes a cycle it goes by

00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:19.148
2Π,
and if it does f

00:07:19.148 --> 00:07:21.863
revolutions per second the
angular frequency is

00:07:21.863 --> 00:07:23.990
2Πf radians per
second.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.129
That's the difference between
revolutions per second and

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:28.329
radians per second.
 

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:33.202
Okay, so this is another way to
write it, and B will be

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:34.560
the same thing.
 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.000
So you should understand what
this wave does.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.271
So imagine the plane wave is
coming from the blackboard

00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:43.639
towards you.
 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:45.946
If it's polarized this way--now
I should tell you what

00:07:45.946 --> 00:07:46.730
polarization is.
 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.870
Polarization is the direction
of E.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.504
B is understood to be
perpendicular to it,

00:07:52.504 --> 00:07:55.305
and the direction of
propagation is perpendicular to

00:07:55.305 --> 00:07:56.240
both of them.
 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.579
You can see E x B
is the direction of propagation

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:01.560
of the wave.
 

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.529
You do the cross product from
E to B and that's

00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:05.620
the way it advances.
 

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.514
So what you will see is that if
these rows in this classroom

00:08:09.514 --> 00:08:11.855
were not curved,
but straight,

00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:16.536
then all the people in the
first row will see exactly the

00:08:16.536 --> 00:08:18.459
same electric field.
 

00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:21.028
So maybe it's pointing up.
 

00:08:21.028 --> 00:08:24.627
Then people in the second row
may see no electric field

00:08:24.627 --> 00:08:28.160
because they happen to be
sitting at that distance.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.639
People in the third row may see
a negative electric field.

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:37.067
So every half-wave length it'll
go from 0 to maximum to 0 to

00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:40.443
minimum back to 0,
and so it oscillates at one

00:08:40.443 --> 00:08:41.120
time.
 

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.384
If you wait a little bit the
whole pattern will shift towards

00:08:44.384 --> 00:08:45.690
the back of the class.
 

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.139
So what these guys saw now you
will saw a little later.

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:50.399
How much later?
 

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:54.019
It's the time light takes to go
from this row to your row.

00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:56.860
That's the delay,
ωt,

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:03.660
in fact I told you,
you can write ky - ωt

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.514
as--
let's see, as k times

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:14.700
y - ct because
ω = kc.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.524
And I told you very early on
that any function of y - ct

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:21.028
is a solution to wave
equation,

00:09:21.028 --> 00:09:24.499
and this tells you there's a
wave propagating to the right at

00:09:24.499 --> 00:09:27.440
speed c,
because whatever it does at one

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.791
time,
say at t = 0,

00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:34.690
at later time it's shifted by
an amount ct.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.287
Now if I send an
electromagnetic wave towards

00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:40.913
you,
first thing you should notice

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:44.740
is the electric field is
perpendicular to the plane,

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.364
in which things are happening
are normal to the direction of

00:09:49.364 --> 00:09:51.644
propagation,
so the field vector is

00:09:51.644 --> 00:09:52.399
perpendicular.
 

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:56.071
Both E and B are
in this plane and the wave is

00:09:56.071 --> 00:09:57.129
going that way.
 

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:59.990
For this reason it's called a
transverse wave.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:05.312
So transverse means all the
action is in a plane

00:10:05.312 --> 00:10:08.710
perpendicular to the motion.
 

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:13.100
So one example of transverse
waves is if you hold a string;

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.116
I give it to the people in the
last row and I hold it and then

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:16.759
I shake it.
 

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:19.940
These ripples will go from me
towards the end of the room.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.779
The ripples are going like this
but the wave is going that way.

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:25.778
That's a transverse wave.
 

00:10:25.778 --> 00:10:28.320
Or if I shake it this way,
same thing, it's going from

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.038
side to side.
 

00:10:29.038 --> 00:10:32.250
The wave is going from me to
you.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.830
A longitudinal wave is a sound
wave.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.230
For example,
when I talk now some diaphragm

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.320
in the throat pushes the air out
and compresses it,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.668
and maybe when it goes the
other way decompress it,

00:10:42.668 --> 00:10:45.168
and the motion of the air is
back and forth,

00:10:45.168 --> 00:10:47.820
namely in the same direction as
the propagation.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.633
So sound waves are
longitudinal,

00:10:49.633 --> 00:10:51.330
light waves are transverse.
 

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.308
Yes?
 

00:10:52.308 --> 00:10:53.538
Student:  You said the
direction of

00:10:53.538 --> 00:10:56.250
E x B gives the
direction of propagation.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.940
Is there a significance to the
magnitude of that cross product?

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.500
Prof: Yes.
 

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.139
We'll come to that later today.
 

00:11:03.139 --> 00:11:03.960
That's correct.
 

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.620
So E x B not only
tells you the direction it's

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.966
reasonable to ask "If it is
a physical quantity,

00:11:08.966 --> 00:11:09.960
what does it mean?
 

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:15.460
And we'll find out shortly what
it means.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.628
Now polarization is the
direction of the electric field

00:11:19.628 --> 00:11:23.101
in the solution,
but we've got to realize that

00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:27.038
not every electric field has to
look like this.

00:11:27.038 --> 00:11:33.543
I can make a new problem where
I have solution looking like

00:11:33.543 --> 00:11:34.330
this.
 

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.980
What is this guy doing?
 

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.542
Can you tell it's going the
other way, because I just

00:11:41.542 --> 00:11:43.558
changed that to that.
 

00:11:43.558 --> 00:11:47.210
So that's the plane wave going
to the left.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.490
Now what should I do with the
B field?

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.529
Its magnitude should be
E/c.

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:56.392
I can also change this to going
backward, otherwise they don't

00:11:56.392 --> 00:11:57.048
form a pair.
 

00:11:57.048 --> 00:11:59.370
E and B have to
form a pair.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.350
But I claim this is not enough.
 

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.668
If you took this pair it'll,
of course,

00:12:04.668 --> 00:12:07.538
satisfy the wave equation
because any function of y

00:12:07.538 --> 00:12:09.759
ct will satisfy the wave
equation,

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:12.687
but I want you to remember
there are four Maxwell

00:12:12.687 --> 00:12:13.418
equations.
 

00:12:13.418 --> 00:12:15.200
You jiggle them all you get the
wave equation.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.149
It's just one consequence of
the four.

00:12:17.149 --> 00:12:20.551
You've got to satisfy all the
Maxwell equations,

00:12:20.551 --> 00:12:24.748
and some of them won't be happy
with this choice in which I

00:12:24.748 --> 00:12:26.918
reverse just the velocity.
 

00:12:26.918 --> 00:12:31.548
Can you think about what's the
way to fix that or what's wrong

00:12:31.548 --> 00:12:32.460
with that?
 

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.514
I'm just saying that if the
wave traveled to the left

00:12:35.514 --> 00:12:38.629
instead of to the right that's
what I've done here.

00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:40.990
I would just reverse the
direction of propagation.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.549
That's not a good answer.
 

00:12:42.549 --> 00:12:44.750
Yes, you've got an answer?
 

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.495
Student:  Does it have
to do with the fact that they're

00:12:46.495 --> 00:12:47.009
a cross product?
 

00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:48.639
Prof: Yeah,
so what's about the cross

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:49.019
product?
 

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:51.653
Student:  To make an
inverse cross product you have

00:12:51.653 --> 00:12:52.668
to make it negative.
 

00:12:52.668 --> 00:12:55.558
Prof: You want the cross
product to dictate the direction

00:12:55.558 --> 00:12:56.110
of motion.
 

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.677
So if E and B are
like this the cross product

00:12:58.677 --> 00:12:59.428
comes this way.
 

00:12:59.428 --> 00:13:02.524
If you want them to go the
other way you've got to reverse

00:13:02.524 --> 00:13:05.240
the direction of B so it
points that way.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.798
That is another pair.
 

00:13:07.798 --> 00:13:11.558
So this, in other words,
you change the velocity here,

00:13:11.558 --> 00:13:13.750
but you forgot to change
it--not you,

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.015
I mean, I did not change it
because I wanted to show you

00:13:17.015 --> 00:13:19.926
that you just cannot put
together any E and

00:13:19.926 --> 00:13:21.528
B that you like.
 

00:13:21.528 --> 00:13:23.350
You've got to make sure that
these form a pair.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.710
This is the pair that obeys
Maxwell equation.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.399
Now I know this will work for
another reason.

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:30.690
If you took this long wave,
okay?

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.428
I want you to think in your
head.

00:13:32.428 --> 00:13:36.110
Rotate it around this axis by
180 degrees.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.850
Can you do that in your head?
 

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.831
Take that axis turn the whole
pattern and it's going the

00:13:40.831 --> 00:13:43.466
opposite way,
but in the process you can see

00:13:43.466 --> 00:13:46.942
this B will rotate from
pointing this way to pointing

00:13:46.942 --> 00:13:47.649
that way.
 

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:51.798
And one of the properties of
nature is that if something is a

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:55.601
solution, then you rotate the
whole thing, that's also a

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:56.500
solution.
 

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.820
You've got to be careful when
you say rotate.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.390
For example,
if you have a grandfather clock

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.918
and you rotate only the clock it
won't work the same way.

00:14:04.918 --> 00:14:07.535
That's because the clock is
very sensitive to the earth,

00:14:07.535 --> 00:14:10.294
but if you took the earth and
the clock, you rotate both of

00:14:10.294 --> 00:14:11.580
them it doesn't matter.
 

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.700
In fact, that's happening all
the time.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.668
So all the things relevant
should be rotated,

00:14:17.668 --> 00:14:21.649
but for electromagnetic field
in vacuum there's nothing else

00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:24.620
to rotate that matters so you
rotate it.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.445
Now another thing you can do
instead of rotating around that

00:14:27.445 --> 00:14:30.222
axis you can rotate it around
this axis, around the axis of

00:14:30.222 --> 00:14:30.990
propagation.
 

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.447
You can turn E to that
or you can turn B to

00:14:34.447 --> 00:14:34.879
that.
 

00:14:34.879 --> 00:14:37.855
I'm not good at drawing
pictures, but in the E-B

00:14:37.855 --> 00:14:41.126
plane you had them like
this, E and B,

00:14:41.126 --> 00:14:43.269
the thing is coming towards
you.

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:46.229
I'm saying you can turn this by
some angle and turn that by the

00:14:46.229 --> 00:14:46.850
same angle.
 

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.889
That'll also form a good
solution.

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:49.799
It must.
 

00:14:49.799 --> 00:14:50.500
I mean, what's wrong?
 

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.158
If you look at a wave this way
it should still obey Maxwell

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:54.029
equations, right?
 

00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:58.200
The titled frame of reference
is as good as the original one.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.798
All right, so now we've got a
few properties of waves,

00:15:02.798 --> 00:15:07.750
and one thing maybe worth
mentioning is the light from the

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:12.964
light bulbs in this room is a
chaotic set of waves being sent

00:15:12.964 --> 00:15:13.918
to you.
 

00:15:13.918 --> 00:15:16.919
Each atom emits light at a
different polarization not in

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:19.865
sync with the other atom,
so it doesn't have a definite

00:15:19.865 --> 00:15:20.629
frequency.
 

00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:24.019
It's a big jumble,
a big mess, but it's a

00:15:24.019 --> 00:15:27.580
superposition of elementary
plane waves.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.360
Actually, I should amend myself.
 

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.259
Plane waves are an idealization.
 

00:15:32.259 --> 00:15:34.982
Every wave you have,
like if you turn on the light

00:15:34.982 --> 00:15:37.928
bulb the waves go out
spherically from the center,

00:15:37.928 --> 00:15:40.691
but far from the center when
this sphere is 10,000 miles in

00:15:40.691 --> 00:15:43.404
radius if you're a little
creature at the end it will look

00:15:43.404 --> 00:15:46.241
like a plane wave,
just like a sphere would look

00:15:46.241 --> 00:15:50.029
like a sheet to somebody who is
very near like the earth does to

00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:50.389
us.
 

00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:52.440
Yep?
 

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.043
Student:  Professor,
could you just say again what

00:15:54.043 --> 00:15:55.820
you said about switching the
cross product or just ________?

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.676
Prof: Yeah,
I was saying that the property

00:15:57.676 --> 00:16:00.528
of the electromagnetic field
that you saw here is that if you

00:16:00.528 --> 00:16:02.860
take the cross product,
E x B...

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:03.548
Student:  You get the
direction.

00:16:03.548 --> 00:16:05.019
Prof: You get the
direction.

00:16:05.019 --> 00:16:09.302
I then took an opposite
direction of propagation,

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:13.049
but took the same E and
B.

00:16:13.049 --> 00:16:14.379
They don't fit.
 

00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:16.583
If you reverse the velocity
here you've got to change this

00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:18.903
so that the cross product of
E and B vectors is

00:16:18.903 --> 00:16:19.908
pointing the opposite.
 

00:16:19.908 --> 00:16:24.769
Student:  Okay,
thank you.

00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:28.298
Prof: Now when you buy
Polaroid glasses I think you

00:16:28.298 --> 00:16:29.970
know what they do,
right?

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.980
The polarizers in the glasses
will allow light to travel in

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.918
only one polarization,
so even though the stuff coming

00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:40.119
in can be randomly polarized,
what comes out of the other

00:16:40.119 --> 00:16:43.730
side towards your eye is
pointing only one way,

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.715
so you cut down about fifty
percent of the light if you

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:47.490
polarize it.
 

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.827
In fact, when light reflects
off a shiny surface and comes to

00:16:50.827 --> 00:16:53.610
your eyes it tends to be
polarized horizontally.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.782
Therefore, if you choose your
Polaroid to be vertical in your

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:59.690
lens, that's the most effective
way to cut the glare.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:04.180
Also, you can take two lenses,
Polaroid lenses,

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.673
and you turn them one relative
to the other you can cancel the

00:17:07.673 --> 00:17:10.188
light completely,
because the first one may let

00:17:10.188 --> 00:17:12.835
it go this way,
the second one will only let it

00:17:12.835 --> 00:17:13.608
go that way.
 

00:17:13.608 --> 00:17:16.943
So if you chop it like this
first then it won't go through

00:17:16.943 --> 00:17:17.880
the other way.
 

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.090
Anyway, light is a very
extensive and interesting

00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:22.809
subject which probably is more
important to you than some of

00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:25.869
these fields,
but we don't have time to go

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.259
into all the aspects of that.
 

00:17:28.259 --> 00:17:32.340
I do want to mention to you
that the light that you and I

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:36.787
see has a very limited range of
the possible wave lengths like

00:17:36.787 --> 00:17:39.630
400 nanometers or 4,000
angstroms,

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.190
namely 400 times 10 to the
minus 9 meters.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.818
To roughly double that is all
you can see.

00:17:44.818 --> 00:17:47.348
Stuff on the other side is
ultra violet,

00:17:47.348 --> 00:17:49.069
then you've x-rays,
on the other side you've got

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:50.923
infrared,
you've got radio waves,

00:17:50.923 --> 00:17:53.318
but they're all electromagnetic
waves.

00:17:53.318 --> 00:17:55.910
All you're doing is varying
ω,

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.582
but nature designed our eyes to
respond only to a range of

00:17:58.582 --> 00:18:01.124
ω's,
because that's where our

00:18:01.124 --> 00:18:02.058
enemies were.
 

00:18:02.058 --> 00:18:05.727
If you've got different enemies
maybe you will have different

00:18:05.727 --> 00:18:06.400
eyesight.
 

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.083
Maybe if you've got a lot of
enemies you'll have eyes all

00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:13.568
over your head like some animals
do, so we got two.

00:18:13.568 --> 00:18:17.403
Anyway, that's another
interesting thing on how nature

00:18:17.403 --> 00:18:19.720
adapts to properties of light.
 

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.535
All right, so let me tell you
now about the energy contained

00:18:24.535 --> 00:18:25.759
in this wave.
 

00:18:25.759 --> 00:18:29.470
You've got to agree that when
you have an electromagnetic wave

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.329
you have energy that you did not
have before.

00:18:32.329 --> 00:18:34.358
Let me ask you a first question.
 

00:18:34.358 --> 00:18:38.538
If I'm sending an
electromagnetic wave towards

00:18:38.538 --> 00:18:42.715
you, and I ask you,
which way is it polarized,

00:18:42.715 --> 00:18:47.079
what will you need to check
that, any idea?

00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:47.779
Look, I've told you.
 

00:18:47.779 --> 00:18:49.911
If you cannot measure something
or tell me in principle how

00:18:49.911 --> 00:18:51.859
we'll measure it you don't know
what you're saying.

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:52.480
Yes?
 

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.160
You have an idea?
 

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:54.769
Anybody?
 

00:18:54.769 --> 00:18:55.788
Yeah, go ahead.
 

00:18:55.788 --> 00:18:57.930
Student:  Was there
anything lost maybe?

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:58.660
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.558
Student:  Was there
anything lost?

00:19:00.558 --> 00:19:02.430
Prof: Yeah,
but forget the polarizing.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:08.490
Go back to basic definition.
 

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:13.368
How will you know there's an
electric field somewhere?

00:19:13.368 --> 00:19:16.670
You think you'd see a little
arrow sticking out in space?

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.390
Yes?
 

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.910
Student:  You take a
test charge.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.205
Prof: Take a charge and
you put it there and you see

00:19:22.205 --> 00:19:23.400
which way it moves.
 

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.009
If it moves like this that's
the polarization,

00:19:26.009 --> 00:19:28.848
if it moves like that,
that's the polarization.

00:19:28.848 --> 00:19:31.821
In fact, the antenna on your
radio has got a wire and the

00:19:31.821 --> 00:19:35.006
electric field from the radio
station comes and starts moving

00:19:35.006 --> 00:19:37.819
the charges in the direction of
the polarization.

00:19:37.819 --> 00:19:38.759
So you guys should know this.
 

00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:42.029
I'm going to assume that you
didn't answer me because you're

00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:44.522
unusually modest,
because you must know how to

00:19:44.522 --> 00:19:46.019
measure electric field.
 

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:48.426
I could even ask you,
how would you find the magnetic

00:19:48.426 --> 00:19:51.251
field," But I don't want to
do that now because we should

00:19:51.251 --> 00:19:53.288
always know how to measure these
things.

00:19:53.288 --> 00:19:56.262
So anyway, we know that when
you have an electric field it

00:19:56.262 --> 00:19:57.150
has got energy.
 

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.968
For example,
when you took a capacitor,

00:19:58.968 --> 00:20:01.838
it took some energy to charge
it, to rip the charges from one

00:20:01.838 --> 00:20:03.848
plate and ram them in the other
plate.

00:20:03.848 --> 00:20:06.921
We saw that as an energy stored
between the plates in the form

00:20:06.921 --> 00:20:11.064
of an electric field,
and the energy of the electric

00:20:11.064 --> 00:20:14.291
field was
ε_0

00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:15.759
E^(2)/2.
 

00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:19.652
Now you may ask me,
you found the energy density in

00:20:19.652 --> 00:20:22.288
a capacitor,
now we're talking about the

00:20:22.288 --> 00:20:24.955
electric field in vacuum
traveling from some radio

00:20:24.955 --> 00:20:27.962
station,
how do I know this formula is

00:20:27.962 --> 00:20:28.450
good?
 

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:32.384
And the remarkable thing about
the field is that any expression

00:20:32.384 --> 00:20:35.048
you derive for it is a local
expression.

00:20:35.048 --> 00:20:37.640
It only cares about what the
field is at this point.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.259
It doesn't care what the origin
is.

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:42.689
It doesn't matter if this is
produced by static charges or

00:20:42.689 --> 00:20:46.057
maybe it's an electric field
produce by changing magnetic

00:20:46.057 --> 00:20:46.660
field.
 

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.200
It does not matter.
 

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.390
The answer does not depend on
the context.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:53.410
This is the energy density,
energy per unit volume.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.749
For a magnetic field it looks
like

00:20:56.749 --> 00:21:01.756
B^(2)/2μ_0,
and you all know by now that

00:21:01.756 --> 00:21:05.057
whatever ε_0
does μ_0 does in

00:21:05.057 --> 00:21:06.118
the other place.
 

00:21:06.118 --> 00:21:09.922
If this guy's up that guy's
down, or in the field laws

00:21:09.922 --> 00:21:14.154
μ_0/2Π's up and
1/4Πε_0

00:21:14.154 --> 00:21:15.588
epsilon is down.
 

00:21:15.588 --> 00:21:17.450
Therefore, if you have a region
where there is,

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:21.788
let's say, no electromagnetic
field and suddenly a wave goes

00:21:21.788 --> 00:21:24.509
by that region has now got
energy,

00:21:24.509 --> 00:21:26.460
and how much energy do we have?
 

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.170
The electrical energy,
you can see,

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:34.663
is ε_0 over
2E_0^(2)

00:21:34.663 --> 00:21:38.618
sin^(2)(ky -
ωt).

00:21:38.618 --> 00:21:45.246
And the magnetic energy is 1
over 2μ_0

00:21:45.246 --> 00:21:50.413
B_0^(2)
sin^(2)(ky -

00:21:50.413 --> 00:21:52.798
ωt).
 

00:21:52.798 --> 00:21:56.507
I will now show you that these
energy densities are actually

00:21:56.507 --> 00:21:57.009
equal.
 

00:21:57.009 --> 00:22:01.318
They're equal because
½μ_0--

00:22:01.318 --> 00:22:05.348
B_0 is
E/c,

00:22:05.348 --> 00:22:11.058
so let's write it as
E_0^(2)/c^(2).

00:22:11.058 --> 00:22:13.894
From the definition of the
velocity of light and

00:22:13.894 --> 00:22:16.848
μ_0 and
ε_0 this is

00:22:16.848 --> 00:22:20.710
simply ε_0
over 2E_0^(2).

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.837
Sorry, E_0^(2)
plus all the sine squares,

00:22:24.837 --> 00:22:26.068
which I forgot.
 

00:22:26.068 --> 00:22:33.491
Therefore, the total energy is
equal to E_0^(2)

00:22:33.491 --> 00:22:38.525
ε_0
sin^(2)(ky -

00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:40.788
ωt).
 

00:22:40.788 --> 00:22:43.298
You got a half from this and
you got a half from that.

00:22:43.298 --> 00:22:46.040
Even though the formula looks
different by the time you put in

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.838
the relation between
μ_0 and

00:22:47.838 --> 00:22:50.041
ε_0 and
B_0 and

00:22:50.041 --> 00:22:52.380
E_0 it turns
out to be equal.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.909
So even though the magnetic
field is weaker than the

00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:57.884
electric field by a factor of
1/c you might think it's

00:22:57.884 --> 00:23:01.646
negligible in terms of energy,
but it's got same energy

00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:05.278
density, and you add them up you
get that.

00:23:05.278 --> 00:23:09.160
Now you can see this energy
density is time dependent and

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.317
space dependent because it's
oscillating with time at a given

00:23:13.317 --> 00:23:16.199
point,
and oscillating with space at a

00:23:16.199 --> 00:23:17.019
given time.
 

00:23:17.019 --> 00:23:19.651
So you can ask yourself,
let me sit at one place and ask

00:23:19.651 --> 00:23:21.573
myself,
"What does the average

00:23:21.573 --> 00:23:24.140
energy density average over a
full cycle?"

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.940
If something is up sometime and
down sometime what's the

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.450
average?
 

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.511
The average will be
ε_0

00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:35.111
E_0^(2)/2,
because the average value of

00:23:35.111 --> 00:23:39.385
sin^(2)θ over a
full cycle is 0 to 2Π

00:23:39.385 --> 00:23:42.509
divided by 2Π
which is ½.

00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:44.630
This is something we have done
before in circuits.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:45.828
You should know that.
 

00:23:45.828 --> 00:23:49.048
Average of sine squared is
half, average of cosine squared

00:23:49.048 --> 00:23:51.231
is half,
and the check is that sine

00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:54.597
squared plus cosine squared
average is 1 because that's 1

00:23:54.597 --> 00:23:55.500
identically.
 

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.970
So try to remember this.
 

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:00.960
So this is the average energy
density.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.038
Next I want to ask the
following question.

00:24:05.038 --> 00:24:10.940
What is the rate at which
energy is coming at me?

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:16.596
And that is called intensity,
I, and it is equal to the watts

00:24:16.596 --> 00:24:20.746
per meter squared,
just like a flow of liquid

00:24:20.746 --> 00:24:24.328
except this is the flow of
energy.

00:24:24.328 --> 00:24:27.390
So what I want to do is take a
square meter,

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:31.571
stand in the way of the beam
and ask how many joules cross

00:24:31.571 --> 00:24:34.202
per second,
or if you want,

00:24:34.202 --> 00:24:37.730
how many watts per square
meter.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:42.233
That's easily calculated from
the energy density and I'll give

00:24:42.233 --> 00:24:43.490
you the reason.
 

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:47.063
It's identical to the reasoning
for currents traveling in a

00:24:47.063 --> 00:24:49.220
wire, or fluid flowing in a
tube.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.838
Suppose you take a region,
a cylindrical cross section

00:24:52.838 --> 00:24:56.390
through which electromagnetic
waves are traveling?

00:24:56.390 --> 00:25:02.741
This is cross section A and I
wait 1 second it'll go a

00:25:02.741 --> 00:25:05.140
distance c.
 

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.265
So all the stuff in a cylinder
of base A and length

00:25:09.265 --> 00:25:13.029
c that energy will go
past this checkpoint.

00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.690
Can you see that?
 

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:14.358
It's like toothpaste.
 

00:25:14.358 --> 00:25:18.126
You squeeze the toothpaste
these guys get passed in 1

00:25:18.126 --> 00:25:18.778
second.
 

00:25:18.778 --> 00:25:23.750
If I want per square meter
we'll just call that 1.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:29.486
Therefore the intensity is
simply the energy density

00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:33.759
multiplied by the velocity of
light.

00:25:33.759 --> 00:25:39.358
That's the rate at which the
energy flows.

00:25:39.358 --> 00:25:43.371
So let us now calculate that
and you'll get a very

00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:45.088
interesting result.
 

00:25:45.088 --> 00:25:52.430
The intensity is equal to the
energy density times c.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:57.386
The energy density was
ε_0

00:25:57.386 --> 00:26:03.960
E_0^(2)
sin^(2)(ky - ωt).

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.180
This is not the average energy.
 

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.960
This is instantaneous.
 

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.368
I'll average it in a moment.
 

00:26:09.368 --> 00:26:15.820
Are you guys with me now
somewhere here,

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.980
here?
 

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:21.224
Now I'm going to write it as
follows, ε_0

00:26:21.224 --> 00:26:26.204
and E_0
then at B_0--I

00:26:26.204 --> 00:26:28.410
forgot a c here.
 

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:29.250
You realize that?
 

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.528
That's another c.
 

00:26:31.528 --> 00:26:35.904
Then E_0 is
B_0 times another c

00:26:35.904 --> 00:26:39.230
times sin^(2)(ky -
ωt).

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.920
And what is that?
 

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.067
c^(2)
ε_0 is

00:26:43.067 --> 00:26:44.318
1/μ_0.
 

00:26:44.318 --> 00:26:50.068
So E_0
B_0 over

00:26:50.068 --> 00:26:56.940
μ_0 sin^(2)(ky -
ωt).

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.536
But if you now define a vector
S, it's called a

00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:06.513
Poynting vector,
which is spelled with a p,

00:27:06.513 --> 00:27:12.558
to be E x B over
μ_0.

00:27:12.558 --> 00:27:16.500
The magnitude of that vector is
precisely the intensity.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.422
The magnitude of S,
which you can either call

00:27:20.422 --> 00:27:24.730
S or you can call it
I, is exactly this.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.224
So E x B except
for a factor 1/μ_0

00:27:28.224 --> 00:27:31.721
not only gives you the direction
of the way of propagation it

00:27:31.721 --> 00:27:35.450
tells you how many watts are
going to cross a square meter,

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:41.220
or how many joules are going to
cross square meter in 1 second.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.060
Now these are things you'll
find in all the textbooks,

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:44.328
so.
 

00:27:44.328 --> 00:27:47.346
All I've done is take this u c,
put it in the formulas with

00:27:47.346 --> 00:27:50.519
E and bring B back
into the picture so that it's

00:27:50.519 --> 00:27:52.858
symmetric between E and
B,

00:27:52.858 --> 00:27:54.730
because this gives the
impression it's all electric.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:56.349
Remember, this is electric and
magnetic.

00:27:56.349 --> 00:27:57.910
They just happen to be equal.
 

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:01.838
This way you can see the role
played by E and B.

00:28:01.838 --> 00:28:05.940
The Poynting vector tells you
the flux of energy.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.108
So here's one example.
 

00:28:07.108 --> 00:28:12.047
At the surface of the earth if
you take a square meter,

00:28:12.047 --> 00:28:15.430
and here's the sun,
emitting light.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.342
You can ask,
"What's the intensity of

00:28:18.342 --> 00:28:19.548
sunlight?"
 

00:28:19.548 --> 00:28:25.039
Anybody have an idea how many
watts per square meter from the

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:25.589
sun.
 

00:28:25.589 --> 00:28:28.430
Student:  A thousand?
 

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.690
Prof: Yes,
very close to a thousand.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:34.529
I think there's some other
numbers, but for our purposes

00:28:34.529 --> 00:28:38.088
it's very close to 1,000 watts
per meter squared.

00:28:38.088 --> 00:28:42.660
That's pretty amazing over the
entire surface of the earth

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.670
every second the sun is pumping
in 1,000 joules.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.430
And you've got to remember the
context of the sun.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:53.394
I mean, here is the sun and
here we are ninety-three million

00:28:53.394 --> 00:28:57.828
miles away, and the light energy
is going and this is our share.

00:28:57.828 --> 00:29:02.163
A tiny circle like 7,000 miles
in diameter you're intercepting

00:29:02.163 --> 00:29:05.999
the light, and every square
meter of it gets a thousand

00:29:05.999 --> 00:29:06.710
watts.
 

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:08.997
You can see the stuff coming
out of the sun,

00:29:08.997 --> 00:29:10.858
its a prodigious amount of
light.

00:29:10.858 --> 00:29:13.618
Anyway, that's the electric
field.

00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:17.170
I mean, that's the intensity,
so let me write the following

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:17.660
thing.
 

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:21.230
This is oscillating rapidly
with time, so let's define an

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.740
average intensity as the average
of the sine squared.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.981
That's E_0B
_0

00:29:26.981 --> 00:29:28.160
/2μ_0.
 

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.957
All these averages are simply
half, anything involving in sine

00:29:31.957 --> 00:29:32.578
squared.
 

00:29:32.578 --> 00:29:34.140
I'm not going to worry about
the half,

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.038
but if you took this to be the
average intensity you can ask,

00:29:37.038 --> 00:29:40.913
"How big is the electric
field that comes with it,"

00:29:40.913 --> 00:29:44.723
because that light is going to
be this electric and magnetic

00:29:44.723 --> 00:29:45.369
field.
 

00:29:45.369 --> 00:29:47.190
That's all light is.
 

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:49.402
So the sunlight produces
electromagnetic field,

00:29:49.402 --> 00:29:52.480
is electromagnetic waves and
I'm asking, "How big is the

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.779
E vector?"
 

00:29:53.779 --> 00:29:56.450
And all you have to do is stick
that into this number.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.226
If you want you can get rid of
B and go back to E

00:29:59.226 --> 00:30:01.509
because E is just
B times c.

00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:04.028
You'll find a pretty surprising
amount.

00:30:04.028 --> 00:30:07.880
It's roughly 1,000 volts per
meter.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.509
Remember electric field is
measured in volts per meter.

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:14.778
What that means is if you took
the field,

00:30:14.778 --> 00:30:17.690
and it's uniform in space,
between one place and another

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.598
place there's a potential
difference of 1,000 volts,

00:30:20.598 --> 00:30:23.886
or it'll take 1,000 joules to
shove a coulomb from lower

00:30:23.886 --> 00:30:25.798
potential to higher potential.
 

00:30:25.798 --> 00:30:29.794
That's a pretty strong field,
but it's very incoherent in

00:30:29.794 --> 00:30:30.650
direction.
 

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:33.230
It's doing this for a while and
doing that for a while,

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:36.230
but if you roughly approximate
it and just ask,

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:41.277
"What is the average field
strength,"

00:30:41.277 --> 00:30:44.460
this is the number you get.
 

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:49.107
So let's talk about one thing
which I've not discussed at all,

00:30:49.107 --> 00:30:53.223
which is, where are these
electromagnetic fields coming

00:30:53.223 --> 00:30:53.910
from?
 

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.868
I said you don't need ρ,
you don't need I,

00:30:56.868 --> 00:31:00.354
you don't need the current,
you don't need the charge,

00:31:00.354 --> 00:31:02.588
these can exist in free space.
 

00:31:02.588 --> 00:31:04.849
But what's the origin of the
electromagnetic waves?

00:31:04.849 --> 00:31:05.980
Anybody know?
 

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.990
When can you get them?
 

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.039
It didn't happen in anything we
studied.

00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:10.838
Yes?
 

00:31:10.838 --> 00:31:12.848
Student:  Electron
changes energy level?

00:31:12.848 --> 00:31:14.836
Prof: Well,
you can say in the atom the

00:31:14.836 --> 00:31:17.441
electron changes energy level,
but before you do the quantum

00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:18.058
mechanics.
 

00:31:18.058 --> 00:31:22.058
In classical theory one can
ask, what is the electric field?

00:31:22.058 --> 00:31:26.598
When does the electric field
produce these waves?

00:31:26.598 --> 00:31:30.480
You take a static charge it has
a 1/r^(2) field which is

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.920
pinned to the charge.
 

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.558
If you go too far from the
charge you don't see it,

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:37.146
but these guys can go off into
space without being anywhere

00:31:37.146 --> 00:31:43.960
near a charge or current,
but what produces them?

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.539
Yes?
 

00:31:45.539 --> 00:31:46.390
You don't know?
 

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:46.970
Yep?
 

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.380
Student:  When it
oscillates.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:48.848
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:31:48.848 --> 00:31:49.690
Student:  When is
oscillates.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.000
Prof: Which oscillates?
 

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.519
Student:  The electric
field.

00:31:52.519 --> 00:31:55.276
Prof: The electric field
is itself oscillating,

00:31:55.276 --> 00:31:57.460
but what's producing the
electric field?

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:00.829
What's the cause of the
electric field?

00:32:00.829 --> 00:32:01.839
Electric field fairy?
 

00:32:01.839 --> 00:32:02.430
Yes?
 

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.410
Student:  When a charge
oscillates?

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.528
Prof: Yes.
 

00:32:06.528 --> 00:32:09.644
In other words,
rather than oscillates the more

00:32:09.644 --> 00:32:13.029
general answer is whenever a
charge accelerates.

00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:16.348
This is a very important result.
 

00:32:16.348 --> 00:32:29.808
Waves are produced by
accelerating charges.

00:32:29.808 --> 00:32:32.714
If they travel at uniform
velocity like in a wire they

00:32:32.714 --> 00:32:35.510
don't produce oscillations,
electromagnetic waves,

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.285
or if they're going in a
circuit at constant rate that

00:32:38.285 --> 00:32:39.279
doesn't produce.
 

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:42.209
But if you have charges which
are say oscillating is one

00:32:42.209 --> 00:32:44.338
example when things are
accelerating,

00:32:44.338 --> 00:32:48.092
right, because you're going
back and forth when you radiate

00:32:48.092 --> 00:32:48.608
light.
 

00:32:48.608 --> 00:32:52.599
So every single source of
electromagnetic wave is

00:32:52.599 --> 00:32:54.430
oscillating charges.
 

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.640
You can sort of imagine why
that will happen.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.380
I mean, if you took a capacitor
plate,

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.460
and you connect it to an AC
source,

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.785
let's say, there may be other
things to keep it from burning

00:33:04.785 --> 00:33:06.898
out,
then what will happen is

00:33:06.898 --> 00:33:11.126
charges will be like this for a
while then they've got to go

00:33:11.126 --> 00:33:14.710
back and forth in order to
change polarity with the

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.199
alternating field,
therefore the charges are going

00:33:18.199 --> 00:33:20.422
back and forth,
and you have a time dependent

00:33:20.422 --> 00:33:21.328
electric field here.
 

00:33:21.328 --> 00:33:24.561
When you have a time dependent
electric field you'll have a

00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:27.905
magnetic field going around it
because the line integral of B

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:30.858
will involve the rate of change
of electric flux.

00:33:30.858 --> 00:33:33.460
And that will also be time
dependent, but if that gets time

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.746
dependent there'll be an
electric field going around

00:33:35.746 --> 00:33:36.150
that.
 

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:39.193
So basically these will curl
around each other whenever

00:33:39.193 --> 00:33:42.073
they're dependent on time,
and they can then free

00:33:42.073 --> 00:33:44.900
themselves loose from the
capacitor and take off.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.874
All you need is two plates,
and an AC source,

00:33:47.874 --> 00:33:51.253
and you connect them,
you will make electromagnetic

00:33:51.253 --> 00:33:51.930
waves.
 

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.921
You'll make them at the
frequency of the source,

00:33:53.921 --> 00:33:55.318
so you won't be able to see it.
 

00:33:55.318 --> 00:33:58.443
Your dog won't be able to see,
but some gadget will be able to

00:33:58.443 --> 00:33:59.108
pick it up.
 

00:33:59.108 --> 00:34:03.048
That's all you need,
oscillating charges.

00:34:03.048 --> 00:34:07.354
So what happens in a radio
station is you could imagine a

00:34:07.354 --> 00:34:10.659
simple radio station with an LC
circuit,

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.389
the current is oscillating at
some rate,

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:14.619
and part of the circuit is in
the antenna,

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:17.498
and the charges are going up
and down as the current goes

00:34:17.498 --> 00:34:19.710
back and forth that sends out
the waves,

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:20.760
and the waves come to your
house.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.119
So here's the picture.
 

00:34:22.119 --> 00:34:26.295
Here's the radio station,
and the waves are emitted in

00:34:26.295 --> 00:34:30.864
big circles, and this is your
house, and here's your little

00:34:30.864 --> 00:34:31.809
antenna.
 

00:34:31.809 --> 00:34:35.485
It's a piece of wire,
and the electric field,

00:34:35.485 --> 00:34:40.079
if it's polarized this way,
will move the charges up and

00:34:40.079 --> 00:34:44.340
down, and charges can be part of
an LC circuit.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.170
So here are the antennas,
if you like;

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.360
part of the circuit.
 

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.476
As the charge goes up and down
the AC current will try to flow

00:34:51.476 --> 00:34:51.949
here.
 

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:55.322
And if you tune this capacitor
so that it resonates with the

00:34:55.322 --> 00:34:58.809
frequency you'll get a hefty
signal from the radio station.

00:34:58.809 --> 00:35:00.780
So in the end it's all charges.
 

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.309
Charges produce the field.
 

00:35:02.309 --> 00:35:03.760
Charges respond to the field.
 

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.039
That was true in the static
case.

00:35:05.039 --> 00:35:07.010
That's true in the time
dependent case.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:08.000
Yes?
 

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.777
Student:  When you say
that the field if it's loose

00:35:10.777 --> 00:35:13.166
from the capacitor,
what do you mean free from the

00:35:13.166 --> 00:35:13.849
capacitor?
 

00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:17.295
Prof: It means it can go
thousands of miles from the

00:35:17.295 --> 00:35:18.010
capacitor.
 

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.764
And if you simply look at the
Coulomb force due to the

00:35:20.764 --> 00:35:23.311
charges, the plus and minus
charges, they die like

00:35:23.311 --> 00:35:24.300
1/r^(2).
 

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.360
So if you calculate
1/r^(2) you will get a

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:31.059
negligible number compared to
the actual electric field.

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:33.300
So it's really like you and
your parents.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:37.119
I mean, at some point you are
free from your parents.

00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:39.668
You are able to manage on your
own, but you had parents

00:35:39.668 --> 00:35:40.989
somewhere sometime,
right?

00:35:40.989 --> 00:35:41.820
That's what it is.
 

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.090
The electromagnetic waves can
go on their own,

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:46.159
but they are not produced on
their own.

00:35:46.159 --> 00:35:47.909
They're produced by charges.
 

00:35:47.909 --> 00:35:49.650
It is just that unlike the
static fields,

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:52.800
which are very near the
currents and charges that

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.762
produce them,
the time dependent fields

00:35:55.762 --> 00:35:57.599
propagate on their own.
 

00:35:57.599 --> 00:36:00.496
E keeps B alive
and B keeps E

00:36:00.496 --> 00:36:00.909
alive.
 

00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:02.210
If E tries to die
there's a

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:04.340
dE/dT that
produces a B.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.485
If the B tries to go
down it produces at

00:36:06.485 --> 00:36:08.909
dB/dT that
produces an E,

00:36:08.909 --> 00:36:10.309
so they go back and forth.
 

00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:12.706
It's really like oscillations
in which you have kinetic to

00:36:12.706 --> 00:36:13.590
potential transfer.
 

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.940
You can have energy transfer.
 

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.880
So the fields cannot die.
 

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.226
They are self-sustaining,
but to get all of that physics

00:36:21.226 --> 00:36:24.389
you had to put the term that
Mr. Maxwell put in.

00:36:24.389 --> 00:36:27.190
Without that term you don't
have this phenomenon.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.340
You don't get it from statics.
 

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.159
So one typical problem you have
is this radio station is,

00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:37.677
let's say, 100 kilowatts and
you're sitting here at some

00:36:37.677 --> 00:36:41.210
distance r from the radio
station.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.875
Then the intensity in your
house will be 100 kilowatts

00:36:44.875 --> 00:36:47.780
spread over a sphere of radius
R.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.650
That will be your intensity.
 

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:54.052
Then you can go from the
intensity and translate it to an

00:36:54.052 --> 00:36:56.246
electric field and say,
"The electric field

00:36:56.246 --> 00:36:58.847
produced by the radio station
oscillates with the following

00:36:58.847 --> 00:36:59.429
amplitude.
 

00:36:59.429 --> 00:37:05.474
I've got to build a circuit
that's smart enough to pick up

00:37:05.474 --> 00:37:08.018
that tiny field."
 

00:37:08.018 --> 00:37:13.309
Okay, so I want to switch now
to my favorite theme.

00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:18.635
The remarkable thing about
electromagnetism is that you can

00:37:18.635 --> 00:37:23.869
ask what happened when physics
went through the Einstein's

00:37:23.869 --> 00:37:27.449
revolution with special
relativity.

00:37:27.449 --> 00:37:30.463
We know everything changed
after Einstein,

00:37:30.463 --> 00:37:34.360
and all the Newtonian mechanics
had to be modified.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.041
And so far I never mentioned
the word relativity,

00:37:37.041 --> 00:37:40.115
so you can ask yourself,
"How are these modified by

00:37:40.115 --> 00:37:41.570
Einstein's work?"
 

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:46.454
So first let me tell you,
remind you, now you guys did

00:37:46.454 --> 00:37:49.219
relativity last term,
right?

00:37:49.219 --> 00:37:53.650
Is there anybody who's never
seen it before?

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.976
Okay, well you don't have to
know a whole lot,

00:37:55.976 --> 00:37:57.840
but let me just say the
following.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:02.239
In the Newtonian world there
was a principle of relativity

00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:07.409
according to which the equations
like F = ma you can ask,

00:38:07.409 --> 00:38:11.719
"Who is allowed to use
this equation?"

00:38:11.719 --> 00:38:17.460
It says by definition an
inertial observer can use this

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.630
equation.
 

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.402
And you say,
"Who is an inertial

00:38:20.402 --> 00:38:21.239
observer?"
 

00:38:21.239 --> 00:38:23.740
You say, "Inertial
observer is anybody who can use

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:24.760
this equation."
 

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.340
Sort of seems to be meaningless
tautology.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.289
What makes it meaningful is the
following.

00:38:31.289 --> 00:38:34.199
There are some people,
at least, for whom this

00:38:34.199 --> 00:38:35.300
equation works.
 

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.909
So there are at least some
inertial observers.

00:38:37.909 --> 00:38:40.190
For example,
we are an inertial observer

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:43.289
because if you want to test this
equation you can say,

00:38:43.289 --> 00:38:45.630
"I leave a piece of chalk
here.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:46.989
I don't apply force.
 

00:38:46.989 --> 00:38:48.579
Does it have an
acceleration?"

00:38:48.579 --> 00:38:50.150
It doesn't.
 

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:53.532
Okay, so I'm obeying at least
the first of the three laws of

00:38:53.532 --> 00:38:54.050
Newton.
 

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:57.503
On the other hand,
if I leave my iPod in Grand

00:38:57.503 --> 00:39:01.650
Central Station and I come back
it's gone, that's not a

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.030
violation of Newton's Laws.
 

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:08.065
That just means I'm stupid
because there are other forces

00:39:08.065 --> 00:39:11.380
acting on that iPod,
and those forces moved it,

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.469
so I can understand that.
 

00:39:13.469 --> 00:39:16.791
So I won't be that traumatized
by the loss of the iPod because

00:39:16.791 --> 00:39:19.079
I feel as I know there's an
explanation.

00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:22.929
But if you go to a plane and
the plane is about to take off

00:39:22.929 --> 00:39:26.909
you leave stuff on the floor it
will slide to the rear end of

00:39:26.909 --> 00:39:27.840
the plane.
 

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.280
You have no F,
but you have an a.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.695
That means an accelerating
plane is a reference frame in

00:39:33.695 --> 00:39:36.179
which people cannot use F =
ma.

00:39:36.179 --> 00:39:38.867
Stuff will accelerate for no
apparent reason,

00:39:38.867 --> 00:39:40.699
so not everybody's inertial.
 

00:39:40.699 --> 00:39:43.309
So you can ask,
"If I have at least one

00:39:43.309 --> 00:39:46.101
inertial observer in the
universe does it imply

00:39:46.101 --> 00:39:48.590
others?,"
and the answer is yes.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:53.059
If I'm inertial and you move
relative to me at constant

00:39:53.059 --> 00:39:55.710
velocity you're also inertial.
 

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.894
There's a large number of
people in the universe all

00:39:57.894 --> 00:40:00.380
allowed to use Newton's Laws if
you've got one of them,

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.809
and they differ by velocity,
constant velocity,

00:40:03.809 --> 00:40:06.340
and we can understand that from
Newton's Laws.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:09.449
Here is a mass and spring
system.

00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:14.775
Newton's Law takes the form
-kx = ma,

00:40:14.775 --> 00:40:19.250
let's say, or let's write
mdv/dt.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:23.797
Now if you go to a train or you
carry this on a train and you go

00:40:23.797 --> 00:40:28.199
at constant velocity I know it
will obey this equation because

00:40:28.199 --> 00:40:30.150
I've not done anything.
 

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.260
It's not my fault you're going
on a train and this is riding

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.119
with you on the train.
 

00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:35.179
It will obey this equation.
 

00:40:35.179 --> 00:40:38.768
By the way, this x is really
x - x_0,

00:40:38.768 --> 00:40:41.190
where x_0 is
the rest length of the spring

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.610
and x - x_0 is
the deviation from that.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:48.409
That's the equation.
 

00:40:48.409 --> 00:40:51.110
Now you and I differ by what?
 

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.780
You and I differ by a constant
velocity.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:59.405
The constant velocity just
means x prime is equal to x -

00:40:59.405 --> 00:41:00.280
ut.
 

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.922
Our origins are differing by an
amount ut after time

00:41:02.922 --> 00:41:05.965
T,
so if an event occurs here for

00:41:05.965 --> 00:41:10.706
me, you have moved a distance
ut and it occurs at a

00:41:10.706 --> 00:41:14.449
distance x' which is x
- ut.

00:41:14.449 --> 00:41:17.735
Then you can see the laws are
going to work for you also

00:41:17.735 --> 00:41:21.498
because even though we disagree
on velocity we don't disagree on

00:41:21.498 --> 00:41:23.590
the rate of change of velocity.
 

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.943
Your velocity and mine differ
by a constant,

00:41:25.943 --> 00:41:28.409
which has no derivative,
so they have the same

00:41:28.409 --> 00:41:29.340
acceleration.
 

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.621
As far as the spring is
concerned if I think it's

00:41:31.621 --> 00:41:34.666
stretched by two inches you will
also think it's stretched by two

00:41:34.666 --> 00:41:35.190
inches.
 

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:37.434
I mean, your x is
zooming to the right according

00:41:37.434 --> 00:41:39.179
to me and your
x_0 is also

00:41:39.179 --> 00:41:42.295
zooming to the right,
but the extension of the spring

00:41:42.295 --> 00:41:43.150
is the same.
 

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:47.108
So F = ma doesn't have
to be modified by going to a

00:41:47.108 --> 00:41:48.150
moving frame.
 

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:51.260
And that is the relativity of
Newtonian mechanics.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.708
If these are the laws of motion
we can understand why if you're

00:41:54.708 --> 00:41:57.085
inside a train,
which is completely closed,

00:41:57.085 --> 00:41:59.989
you cannot look outside and
it's going at uniform velocity

00:41:59.989 --> 00:42:03.610
with respect to the ground,
you cannot tell.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:07.150
You cannot tell because nothing
you do will be different.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:09.353
Because everything you observe
in the world is controlled by

00:42:09.353 --> 00:42:11.034
Newton's Laws,
and Newton's Laws are

00:42:11.034 --> 00:42:13.820
unaffected by adding a constant
velocity to everything.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.309
So when you wake up and I say,
"Is the train

00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:17.969
moving,"
you cannot tell.

00:42:17.969 --> 00:42:24.570
Okay, so that's by doing
physics experiments.

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:26.891
You cannot say,
"It says Amtrak so I know

00:42:26.891 --> 00:42:28.130
it's not moving."
 

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.610
That kind of argument is based
on sociological axioms.

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:34.505
I'm just saying can you--after
all it's possible,

00:42:34.505 --> 00:42:36.737
theoretically,
Amtrak trains can move,

00:42:36.737 --> 00:42:39.030
so you must admit the
possibility.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:43.969
Okay, now you come to Maxwell's
equations and electromagnetic

00:42:43.969 --> 00:42:44.710
theory.
 

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:46.670
Let me write down what we have.
 

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:51.563
The first thing we have is
q equals--I'm sorry,

00:42:51.563 --> 00:42:56.085
q times E
v x B is the

00:42:56.085 --> 00:42:57.010
force.
 

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:59.760
Then let me write down one
other consequence,

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:06.148
d^(2)E/dx^(2) −
(1/c^(2))d^(2)E

00:43:06.148 --> 00:43:09.760
/dt^(2) is 0.
 

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:13.748
These are some of the results
we got from electromagnetic

00:43:13.748 --> 00:43:14.389
theory.
 

00:43:14.389 --> 00:43:18.050
Now comes the important
question.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:22.610
This is the velocity of a
particle according to whom?

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:25.820
That question came up earlier
in the class.

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.300
Who is supposed to use it?
 

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.766
I may assume it worked for me,
but how do I know then when you

00:43:32.766 --> 00:43:36.005
see it it's got a different
velocity will you get the same

00:43:36.005 --> 00:43:37.710
physical world that I get.
 

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:41.101
Now let's look at this
equation, this also came from

00:43:41.101 --> 00:43:44.427
Maxwell's equations,
and compare the equation for a

00:43:44.427 --> 00:43:45.159
string.
 

00:43:45.159 --> 00:43:48.385
Let me call ψ
as the displacement of the

00:43:48.385 --> 00:43:53.628
string rather than y,
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2) is

00:43:53.628 --> 00:43:57.518
(1/v^(2))d^(2
)ψ/dt^(2).

00:43:57.518 --> 00:44:00.389
I just wrote the equation
shifting to the other side.

00:44:00.389 --> 00:44:03.929
They look very similar.
 

00:44:03.929 --> 00:44:12.827
Here v is the velocity of the
waves according to a person for

00:44:12.827 --> 00:44:17.130
whom the string is at rest.
 

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.050
Okay, according to whom the
string is at rest.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:21.250
You understand that?
 

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:24.311
This velocity,
because the waves are traveling

00:44:24.311 --> 00:44:26.829
in the string,
a at speed v.

00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:32.550
So this equation is to be used
in its present form only by a

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:36.429
person for whom the string is at
rest.

00:44:36.429 --> 00:44:40.472
If you want to see the string
from a moving frame then

00:44:40.472 --> 00:44:44.083
x' is x - ut,
and in classical mechanics

00:44:44.083 --> 00:44:46.610
t' is equal to t.
 

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:49.240
You can do the change of
variables with these partial

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:49.949
derivatives.
 

00:44:49.949 --> 00:44:53.603
I don't want to do that,
but you can say d/dx of

00:44:53.603 --> 00:44:57.054
ψ is equal to d/dx'
of ψ times dx'

00:44:57.054 --> 00:45:00.548
over dx,
then dψ/dt',

00:45:00.548 --> 00:45:03.150
then dt' over dx.
 

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.865
Now t' is the same as
t, but formally we can

00:45:05.865 --> 00:45:08.376
change variables,
and we can take this equation

00:45:08.376 --> 00:45:11.920
and rewrite it in a frame moving
to the right at speed u,

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.579
and I promise you it won't look
like this.

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:18.070
It will look very different.
 

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:21.983
More importantly at least
understand conceptually that the

00:45:21.983 --> 00:45:25.967
velocity u of the moving
observer will appear in the

00:45:25.967 --> 00:45:28.864
final equations,
because these derivatives,

00:45:28.864 --> 00:45:31.827
x' over x and so
on contain the velocity

00:45:31.827 --> 00:45:32.500
u.
 

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.157
Can you see that,
dx'/dt has the velocity

00:45:35.157 --> 00:45:35.780
u?
 

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:39.233
So when you make all these
changes and put them in you'll

00:45:39.233 --> 00:45:42.934
get a new equation involving
x' and t' in which

00:45:42.934 --> 00:45:45.280
the velocity u will
appear.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.313
So if you are that person you
have to decide what's the

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:53.199
velocity to use for you,
and the answer is unique.

00:45:53.199 --> 00:45:56.079
It's your velocity relative to
the string.

00:45:56.079 --> 00:45:57.619
The string is anchored in the
lab.

00:45:57.619 --> 00:46:00.702
If you happen to have a speed
u relative to that that's

00:46:00.702 --> 00:46:02.219
the speed you should put in.
 

00:46:02.219 --> 00:46:05.090
Therefore, the equation is not
the same for everybody.

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:09.340
There is a special observer for
whom the string is at rest,

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.789
namely in the laboratory frame
for whom this equation works,

00:46:11.789 --> 00:46:14.150
and v is the velocity
for that person.

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:18.570
Now we come to this equation.
 

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:20.940
It has no reference to the
velocity of the observer.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:25.315
It's got a velocity of light,
and you can ask who is supposed

00:46:25.315 --> 00:46:26.190
to use it.
 

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:29.420
Whereas in the string we know
the privileged frame of

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:33.208
reference is where the string is
nailed down, but the light is

00:46:33.208 --> 00:46:34.699
traveling in vacuum.
 

00:46:34.699 --> 00:46:37.369
There is no frame of reference.
 

00:46:37.369 --> 00:46:41.420
People thought maybe even the
vacuum contains a medium called

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:41.960
ether.
 

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.771
Because everything needs a
medium to travel they said there

00:46:44.771 --> 00:46:45.449
is an ether.
 

00:46:45.449 --> 00:46:48.081
Then, of course,
this is to be used only by

00:46:48.081 --> 00:46:50.650
people who live in that ether at
rest,

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:54.561
but we are moving relative to
the ether because we are on the

00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:57.039
earth which is going around the
sun.

00:46:57.039 --> 00:46:58.681
You may say,
"Well, maybe today I just

00:46:58.681 --> 00:47:00.440
happen to be at rest relative to
the ether.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.762
That's possible,
but then tomorrow I cannot be

00:47:02.762 --> 00:47:04.570
because I'm going around the
sun.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.606
Six months from now I'm going
the opposite way around the sun

00:47:07.606 --> 00:47:10.809
at a huge speed,
but what I find is every single

00:47:10.809 --> 00:47:14.349
day of the year I'm able to use
these equations.

00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:18.699
That means they apply to me no
matter what my velocity is.

00:47:18.699 --> 00:47:21.802
So these equations,
it turns out,

00:47:21.802 --> 00:47:27.815
are valid for any observer who
is inertial, namely one for whom

00:47:27.815 --> 00:47:31.889
at low velocities Newton's Laws
apply.

00:47:31.889 --> 00:47:35.340
Now what people were worried
about in the old days they said,

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:39.253
"Look, let's take x'x -
ut and t' equal to

00:47:39.253 --> 00:47:42.320
t and put it into this
equation."

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.865
Then they found the equation
changed their form because it's

00:47:45.865 --> 00:47:48.030
just like this wave equation
here.

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:50.297
Then they said,
"We've got to change the

00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:53.030
equation because it depends on
our speed u,

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:56.219
but there is no valid choice
for what our u is.

00:47:56.219 --> 00:47:59.539
What is our speed relative to
this magical ether?"

00:47:59.539 --> 00:48:01.789
That was what they were worried
about until Einstein came and

00:48:01.789 --> 00:48:04.034
said,
"There is no either and

00:48:04.034 --> 00:48:07.369
this is the wrong set of
transformations."

00:48:07.369 --> 00:48:11.742
If you use x' equal to
x - ut divided by this 1

00:48:11.742 --> 00:48:15.679
− u^(2) over
c^(2) and t' is

00:48:15.679 --> 00:48:20.710
t - ux over c^(2)
divided by the same square root,

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:25.559
if you change coordinates this
way you'll find amazingly,

00:48:25.559 --> 00:48:29.798
if you change all the
d/dx's to d/dx'

00:48:29.798 --> 00:48:34.461
and did the whole partial
derivatives and chain rule and

00:48:34.461 --> 00:48:39.548
so on you will find that in the
new frame of reference you'll

00:48:39.548 --> 00:48:43.280
find the equation will look like
this.

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.219
It will look the same for
anybody moving relative to me at

00:48:48.219 --> 00:48:49.260
any speed.
 

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:53.050
That's why it's not clear that
I'm the privileged user.

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:57.541
All people at uniform relative
motion can use the very same

00:48:57.541 --> 00:49:01.800
equation with the very same
number c entering.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.360
So this was the great triumph
of the Maxwell theory.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:08.889
It was that it was already
consist with the relativity.

00:49:08.889 --> 00:49:12.251
In fact it is what led to
Einstein's revolution because

00:49:12.251 --> 00:49:16.112
this equation said no matter who
you are a light pulse is going

00:49:16.112 --> 00:49:18.789
to travel at a speed c
for you,

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:21.219
no matter who you are.
 

00:49:21.219 --> 00:49:23.974
That's very strange because
every signal we know has a

00:49:23.974 --> 00:49:27.250
property that if you move along
the signal its speed is reduced,

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:27.768
right?
 

00:49:27.768 --> 00:49:31.414
If you've got a bullet going at
700 miles per second if you

00:49:31.414 --> 00:49:34.619
travel at 400 you will think it
is going at 300,

00:49:34.619 --> 00:49:37.277
but if it's a beam of light
it's supposed to have the same

00:49:37.277 --> 00:49:39.661
velocity for everybody,
even those moving in the same

00:49:39.661 --> 00:49:41.199
direction and the opposite
direction.

00:49:41.199 --> 00:49:43.159
It doesn't matter.
 

00:49:43.159 --> 00:49:46.766
Therefore, something had to
change with our definition of

00:49:46.766 --> 00:49:48.762
space, and time,
and velocities,

00:49:48.762 --> 00:49:52.239
and Einstein replaced it with
these new equations.

00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:55.806
And one of the consequences of
that equation is that if I have

00:49:55.806 --> 00:49:59.195
an object that is going at a
speed v and they're moving the

00:49:59.195 --> 00:50:02.820
same direction at the speed u in
the old days you will subtract

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.159
your speed in the same
direction,

00:50:05.159 --> 00:50:09.016
but the correct answer is--this
is 1 - uv over

00:50:09.016 --> 00:50:10.130
c^(2).
 

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:12.818
This is the relativistic
equation about how to change

00:50:12.818 --> 00:50:13.489
velocities.
 

00:50:13.489 --> 00:50:16.219
v is the speed of an
object according to me.

00:50:16.219 --> 00:50:18.780
You are moving in the same
direction at speed u.

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:22.840
You will measure the speed w
given by this.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.400
If u and v are
much smaller than c you

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.827
can forget this and it looks
like the good old Newtonian

00:50:27.827 --> 00:50:29.835
days,
but if u and v

00:50:29.835 --> 00:50:33.076
are comparable to c then
the denominator is one less

00:50:33.076 --> 00:50:34.572
than,
one minus something,

00:50:34.572 --> 00:50:37.300
so the whole thing will be a
little bigger than what you

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.079
thought because you're dividing
by 1 minus something.

00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:43.056
And finally,
if what I was looking at was a

00:50:43.056 --> 00:50:45.492
light pulse,
that means v is equal to

00:50:45.492 --> 00:50:48.835
c,
I get c - u divided by 1

00:50:48.835 --> 00:50:51.690
- uc over c^(2).
 

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:55.949
And if you fiddle with that
you'll find it's c.

00:50:55.949 --> 00:50:58.871
So this law of transformation
of velocity has the amazing

00:50:58.871 --> 00:51:02.105
property that if I'm observing a
light pulse that's got a speed

00:51:02.105 --> 00:51:04.610
c you will also get a
speed c.

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:08.119
So it's a very beautiful way in
which the mystery was resolved.

00:51:08.119 --> 00:51:11.351
So Maxwell gave these
equations, did not give a

00:51:11.351 --> 00:51:13.530
preferred frame of reference.
 

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:15.789
Then you've got to ask
yourself, "What coordinate

00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:18.347
transformation should exist so
that the equation has the same

00:51:18.347 --> 00:51:20.733
form for everybody,"
because it doesn't tell you who

00:51:20.733 --> 00:51:21.800
supposed to use it.
 

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.489
Then you get this equation.
 

00:51:23.489 --> 00:51:26.503
You can get to this equation
simply by demanding that two

00:51:26.503 --> 00:51:29.411
observers looking at a light
pulse somehow get the same

00:51:29.411 --> 00:51:29.949
speed.
 

00:51:29.949 --> 00:51:32.855
If you fiddle with that and the
symmetry between the two

00:51:32.855 --> 00:51:34.440
observers you will get this.
 

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.967
Anyway, I just wanted to tell
you that there are many things

00:51:37.967 --> 00:51:40.777
you have to change,
but you don't have to change

00:51:40.777 --> 00:51:42.809
any of electromagnetic theory.
 

00:51:42.809 --> 00:51:47.380
The equations I wrote down are
correct.

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:52.945
Okay, the last thing I want to
do is something I promised long

00:51:52.945 --> 00:51:56.230
ago, which is the following
thing.

00:51:56.230 --> 00:52:00.177
If you believe in relativity,
namely if you believe that the

00:52:00.177 --> 00:52:04.324
laws of physics should have the
same form for people in uniform

00:52:04.324 --> 00:52:07.840
relative motion,
you can deduce the presence of

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:11.570
magnetism given just the
presence of electrostatics.

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:13.858
In other words,
suppose you never heard of

00:52:13.858 --> 00:52:14.530
magnetism.
 

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:17.420
I can show you that it must
exist.

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:22.210
magnetic forces must exist,
and I show that as follows.

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:25.202
Before I show that you need a
couple of results that you guys

00:52:25.202 --> 00:52:26.800
may not remember all the time.
 

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:31.947
First result is if you've got a
wire and it's got n is

00:52:31.947 --> 00:52:37.039
the number of carriers,
charge carriers per unit

00:52:37.039 --> 00:52:43.710
volume, and A is the
cross section of the wire,

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:48.690
and e is the charge of
the carrier,

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:52.969
and v is the velocity of
the carrier,

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:57.039
then the current is equal to
n,

00:52:57.039 --> 00:53:03.059
sorry, nAve.
 

00:53:03.059 --> 00:53:06.039
Let me tell you why that is
true.

00:53:06.039 --> 00:53:07.489
Look at the wire.
 

00:53:07.489 --> 00:53:09.907
I'm going to stretch it a
little bit so it looks like a

00:53:09.907 --> 00:53:11.518
thing with a finite cross
section.

00:53:11.518 --> 00:53:13.260
It's just like what I did
earlier on.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:17.240
If you wait 1 second the
carriers in that cylinder will

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.443
have crossed the checkpoint,
and the volume of that region

00:53:21.443 --> 00:53:23.730
is A times v.
 

00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:26.760
This is the number of carriers
per unit volume,

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.699
and each one carries charge
e,

00:53:28.699 --> 00:53:32.347
that many coulombs would have
gone past this point and that's

00:53:32.347 --> 00:53:35.389
the meaning of current,
first thing to know.

00:53:35.389 --> 00:53:40.286
Second thing to know,
if I took a rod of length

00:53:40.286 --> 00:53:44.650
L and I put some charges
on it,

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:48.000
and they had a certain density
n_0,

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.563
if the rod moves at the
velocity v you know it

00:53:52.563 --> 00:53:56.188
will shrink,
therefore these plus signs will

00:53:56.188 --> 00:53:59.722
be compressed,
and to a person seeing the

00:53:59.722 --> 00:54:05.039
moving rod the density n
will be n_0

00:54:05.039 --> 00:54:10.356
(the density at rest) divided by
1 − v^(2) over

00:54:10.356 --> 00:54:11.980
c^(2).
 

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:16.036
This is a relativistic effect -
that the number of charges get

00:54:16.036 --> 00:54:19.230
squeezed because the rod itself
gets squeezed.

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:23.503
So a moving rod which is
charged will appear to have a

00:54:23.503 --> 00:54:25.440
higher charge density.
 

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.280
And the final result I'm going
to invoke is the following.

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:36.110
What is the charge per unit
length?

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:40.516
If the charge per unit volume
is n then I claim the

00:54:40.516 --> 00:54:43.300
answer is n times
a.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.210
That's also easy to understand.
 

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:48.440
If you took a unit length of
this wire,

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.757
unit length,
the volume of that is just

00:54:50.757 --> 00:54:54.356
A times 1 and that times
the density is the amount of

00:54:54.356 --> 00:54:55.820
charge that's there.
 

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:58.431
So if you have a very thin wire
you may like to think about

00:54:58.431 --> 00:55:01.179
charge per unit length rather
than charge per unit volume,

00:55:01.179 --> 00:55:04.760
and this is the way to go from
one to the other.

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.070
Now we are ready.
 

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:11.121
Now I'm ready to show you how
just by thinking you can deduce

00:55:11.121 --> 00:55:13.480
the presence of magnetism.
 

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.059
And I like this argument
because quite often this is how

00:55:16.059 --> 00:55:18.030
people make, theorists make
discoveries.

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:20.300
They will take something that's
known.

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.751
They'll appeal to a principle
like symmetry,

00:55:22.751 --> 00:55:24.349
or relativity or whatever.
 

00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:26.342
Then they will say,
"This implies that there

00:55:26.342 --> 00:55:28.208
is a new force,
and I'm going to tell you what

00:55:28.208 --> 00:55:29.329
the new force is."
 

00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:32.469
So here's what I want you to
imagine.

00:55:32.469 --> 00:55:39.208
There's a very long infinite
line of charge and right on top

00:55:39.208 --> 00:55:45.719
of it there's another infinite
line of negative charge.

00:55:45.719 --> 00:55:49.380
If they're just sitting there
there's nothing interesting.

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:58.106
Now what I want to do is I want
to have the upper thing going at

00:55:58.106 --> 00:56:00.739
a speed v.
 

00:56:00.739 --> 00:56:12.405
Now n_0^( )^(
)is charge density of plus

00:56:12.405 --> 00:56:23.447
charges in the rest frame of the
rod, of the plus rod,

00:56:23.447 --> 00:56:28.239
and likewise minus.
 

00:56:28.239 --> 00:56:29.010
Are you with me?
 

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:31.800
Each rod has a certain density
when it's at rest.

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.179
I'm going to call that with a
subscript zero.

00:56:35.179 --> 00:56:39.420
Now I want to arrange this wire
to be electrically neutral.

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:42.454
I want it to be neutral,
and I'm producing the current

00:56:42.454 --> 00:56:44.860
by moving the plus charges to
the right.

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:45.849
I'm dragging them.
 

00:56:45.849 --> 00:56:48.230
The minus charges are not doing
anything.

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:49.900
So what is the current?
 

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:54.610
The current is going to be the
density of plus charges,

00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:58.884
times the velocity,
times area, times the value of

00:56:58.884 --> 00:57:00.280
each charge.
 

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.876
But for the wire to be
neutral--this is where I want

00:57:03.876 --> 00:57:05.780
you to follow me closely.
 

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:09.389
The two of them cannot have the
same densities at rest because

00:57:09.389 --> 00:57:12.880
if the plus charge had the same
density at rest as the minus

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:16.550
charge when it starts moving and
it starts compressing the plus

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:19.922
density will exceed the minus
density and the wire will be

00:57:19.922 --> 00:57:20.869
neutral.
 

00:57:20.869 --> 00:57:26.079
So I cook it up so that
n_0^( ) with

00:57:26.079 --> 00:57:31.489
this factor is the density of
minus charges at rest.

00:57:31.489 --> 00:57:32.619
Are you with me?
 

00:57:32.619 --> 00:57:36.025
I take a rod with positive
charge somewhat less than the

00:57:36.025 --> 00:57:39.429
density that the negative
charges are going to have,

00:57:39.429 --> 00:57:44.217
but by moving it at the
suitable speed I bring these two

00:57:44.217 --> 00:57:46.829
densities to the same value.
 

00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:50.005
So I want you to follow this in
some detail because it's not so

00:57:50.005 --> 00:57:50.619
difficult.
 

00:57:50.619 --> 00:57:53.340
This is the neutrality
condition for the wire.

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:58.440
I want the wire to be neutral.
 

00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.112
See normally when you don't
think in relativist terms you'll

00:58:01.112 --> 00:58:02.869
say,
"Take a plus charge rod

00:58:02.869 --> 00:58:06.003
and a minus charge rod and make
sure the charges are equal per

00:58:06.003 --> 00:58:07.360
length,
and drag one of them,

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.530
or you've got a current."
 

00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:10.469
That works in a
non-relativistic limit,

00:58:10.469 --> 00:58:14.603
but if you take into account
length contraction you won't get

00:58:14.603 --> 00:58:18.394
neutrality unless the plus
charge had a slightly smaller

00:58:18.394 --> 00:58:22.528
density in its own rest frame
that got boosted by this factor

00:58:22.528 --> 00:58:25.699
to equal the density of negative
charge.

00:58:25.699 --> 00:58:34.063
Okay, now imagine a particle at
rest here, and you know all

00:58:34.063 --> 00:58:37.380
about electrostatics.
 

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:49.719
What do you think it will do?
 

00:58:49.719 --> 00:58:51.079
You've never heard of magnetism.
 

00:58:51.079 --> 00:58:52.420
You've heard of electrostatics.
 

00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:54.250
What will this charge do?
 

00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:55.090
Yep?
 

00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:56.349
Student:  It is positive.
 

00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:58.340
It'd probably be attracted.
 

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:00.210
Prof: Why would it be
attracted?

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:05.693
Student:  Because the
negative wire has more density

00:59:05.693 --> 00:59:06.449
and...
 

00:59:06.449 --> 00:59:06.880
Prof: No, no.
 

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.480
That's what I said.
 

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.130
No.
 

00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:11.965
I arranged it so that the
positive wire,

00:59:11.965 --> 00:59:16.181
the moving positive wire has
the same density as the static

00:59:16.181 --> 00:59:17.489
negative wire.
 

00:59:17.489 --> 00:59:19.429
You understand?
 

00:59:19.429 --> 00:59:21.329
I cooked it up so that the wire
is neutral.

00:59:21.329 --> 00:59:23.626
All I'm telling you is,
if one set of charges are

00:59:23.626 --> 00:59:26.355
sliding to the right at a
certain speed that rod must have

00:59:26.355 --> 00:59:29.179
a density that's somewhat lower
in its own rest frame,

00:59:29.179 --> 00:59:32.172
but by the time you translate
it to the laboratory frame it's

00:59:32.172 --> 00:59:33.320
electrically neutral.
 

00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.949
So what'll this charge do is my
question.

00:59:35.949 --> 00:59:37.429
Student: 
&gt;

00:59:37.429 --> 00:59:39.510
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.605
It should not experience any
electrical force,

00:59:41.605 --> 00:59:42.630
you understand that?
 

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:47.679
Our prediction is that it will
just stay there because it's

00:59:47.679 --> 00:59:51.510
neutral and all we know is
electrostatics.

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:54.721
It can have any velocity,
but I want it to have a

00:59:54.721 --> 00:59:56.059
velocity v.
 

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:59.889
Electrostatics doesn't care
what the velocity of the charge

00:59:59.889 --> 01:00:00.219
is.
 

01:00:00.219 --> 01:00:07.016
It's still supposed to go in a
straight line because the wire

01:00:07.016 --> 01:00:08.489
is neutral.
 

01:00:08.489 --> 01:00:12.990
But now I say I'm allowed to
view the physics from any frame

01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:14.670
of reference I want.
 

01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:18.900
Let me go to the frame of
reference of this charge.

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.480
I move to the right.
 

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.101
So in general,
if you want to analyze the

01:00:23.101 --> 01:00:25.791
problem carefully,
you can have this wire moving

01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:28.460
at one speed and this charge
moving at a different speed,

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.735
but I want to do the easier
case where they're both the

01:00:30.735 --> 01:00:31.030
same.
 

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:33.260
It makes life easier.
 

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:41.780
So go to the rest frame of
charge.

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.570
You can already see what's
going to happen in the rest

01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:45.730
frame of the charge.
 

01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:49.329
If you go to the frame moving
with the particle the plus wire

01:00:49.329 --> 01:00:52.032
comes to rest,
so the density of the plus

01:00:52.032 --> 01:00:55.659
charges will just become
n_0^( )^( ),

01:00:55.659 --> 01:00:57.719
the rest density of the plus
charge,

01:00:57.719 --> 01:01:02.478
but the minus charges now they
will be boosted by this factor

01:01:02.478 --> 01:01:05.809
because they're going the
opposite way,

01:01:05.809 --> 01:01:07.429
and it doesn't matter which way
they're moving.

01:01:07.429 --> 01:01:08.760
Things depend on v squared.
 

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.179
The minus charges will appear
compressed.

01:01:12.179 --> 01:01:15.409
So if previously they're
balanced now they won't balance.

01:01:15.409 --> 01:01:18.650
In fact, n_-
is n_0^(- )

01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:22.407
over this,
which is n_0^(

01:01:22.407 --> 01:01:26.989
) divided by 1 -
v^(2)/c^(2).

01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:31.010
Therefore the wire will appear
to be negatively charged because

01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:33.539
the negative charges are that
value,

01:01:33.539 --> 01:01:36.760
the positive charges are that
value,

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:43.476
so net charge on the wire,
net charge density will be

01:01:43.476 --> 01:01:49.289
equal to -n_0^(
)^( )over 1 -

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:55.489
v^(2)/c^(2)
n_0^( ).

01:01:55.489 --> 01:01:57.661
If you like,
this is the plus charge and

01:01:57.661 --> 01:02:00.670
that's the minus charge times
e, if you like.

01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:02.768
And I'm going to make an
approximation.

01:02:02.768 --> 01:02:06.697
I'm going to approximate this
is n_0^( )^(

01:02:06.697 --> 01:02:08.730
)times 1 v^(2)/c^(2).
 

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:12.152
There are more terms,
but in the binomial expansion

01:02:12.152 --> 01:02:14.889
I'm going to stop with the first
term.

01:02:14.889 --> 01:02:18.038
So this is the result that's
very good in the limit of small

01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:20.760
v/c, but v/c is
not set equal to 0.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.090
It is set equal to a finite but
small amount.

01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:28.708
So if you compare those two you
will find the net charge is -

01:02:28.708 --> 01:02:32.360
n_0^( )
v^(2)/c^(2).

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.909
That's going to be the charge
on the wire.

01:02:37.909 --> 01:02:41.065
So to the person moving with
this charge the wire looks

01:02:41.065 --> 01:02:41.650
charged.
 

01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:46.239
In fact it looks negatively
charged.

01:02:46.239 --> 01:02:48.918
So you know,
knowing just electrostatics,

01:02:48.918 --> 01:02:50.659
what the charge will do.
 

01:02:50.659 --> 01:02:55.619
The charge will be drawn to the
wire, start moving towards the

01:02:55.619 --> 01:02:56.190
wire.
 

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:58.480
That's a fact.
 

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:01.679
Well, if it's moving towards
the wire for me it better be

01:03:01.679 --> 01:03:05.052
moving towards the wire for the
original person also because

01:03:05.052 --> 01:03:08.081
even if you and I move
horizontally the fact that your

01:03:08.081 --> 01:03:11.625
moving transverse to a velocity
is going to be a true statement

01:03:11.625 --> 01:03:12.940
in both frames.
 

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:16.184
From that you will conclude
that even in the original

01:03:16.184 --> 01:03:19.927
laboratory frame this moving
charge would have been attracted

01:03:19.927 --> 01:03:23.722
to that wire,
and it's attracted by virtue of

01:03:23.722 --> 01:03:24.929
its velocity.
 

01:03:24.929 --> 01:03:29.922
So that means there is a new
force in which a charge is

01:03:29.922 --> 01:03:34.175
attracted to the current in the
same direction,

01:03:34.175 --> 01:03:35.099
right?
 

01:03:35.099 --> 01:03:37.351
So let's ask,
"What is the force of

01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:38.449
attraction?"
 

01:03:38.449 --> 01:03:41.402
In Newtonian mechanics--I mean,
at this point once you've got

01:03:41.402 --> 01:03:44.505
this length contraction you can
just think in terms of Newtonian

01:03:44.505 --> 01:03:47.458
formulas because the errors you
make involve higher powers of

01:03:47.458 --> 01:03:48.690
v^(2)/c^(2).
 

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:50.289
The leading term is this.
 

01:03:50.289 --> 01:03:51.050
So look at that.
 

01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:57.398
You have a net charge of
n_ ^(0 )v^(2)

01:03:57.398 --> 01:03:59.050
/c^(2).
 

01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:05.182
You have a charge per unit
length which is the area of the

01:04:05.182 --> 01:04:07.119
wire times that.
 

01:04:07.119 --> 01:04:09.260
I sorry, that's charge e.
 

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.530
That's the density.
 

01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:12.710
That's the actual charge.
 

01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:14.920
That's the λ.
 

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.827
So what's the electric field of
a wire with charge per unit

01:04:17.827 --> 01:04:18.380
λ?
 

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:24.315
I remind you it's λ
/2Πε_0

01:04:24.315 --> 01:04:26.809
r.
 

01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:33.704
So for this particular lambda
it's n_ ^(0 )v^(2)

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:39.565
over c^(2) eA times
½Πε

01:04:39.565 --> 01:04:42.440
_0r.
 

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:46.088
In other words in its particle
rest frame there'll be an

01:04:46.088 --> 01:04:49.072
electrical field because there's
a net charge,

01:04:49.072 --> 01:04:52.389
negative charge,
of that strength on the wire.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:54.139
Once you've got a charge per
unit length

01:04:54.139 --> 01:04:56.380
λ/2Πε
_0r is the

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:58.309
field attracting it toward the
center,

01:04:58.309 --> 01:05:00.340
so that's the force.
 

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:01.820
So I'm going to write it as
follows.

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.949
I'm going to write it as
n_

01:05:04.949 --> 01:05:10.072
^(0)veA_1
over 2Πε_0

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:16.429
c^(2) times another
e and another v.

01:05:16.429 --> 01:05:27.289
This is the force,
this e times E.

01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:30.561
In Newtonian approximation the
force perpendicular to the

01:05:30.561 --> 01:05:32.900
motion is the same for all
observers,

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:36.010
therefore I ask you--and this
force must be present even in

01:05:36.010 --> 01:05:38.369
the lab,
but look at this force.

01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:45.940
This guy is the current,
nevA is the current.

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:49.735
This guy
1/ε_0c^(2) is

01:05:49.735 --> 01:05:52.170
μ_0/2Π.
 

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:54.070
This is ev.
 

01:05:54.070 --> 01:05:57.472
You see, this is the exactly
the magnetic force we got,

01:05:57.472 --> 01:06:00.119
μ_0
I/2Πr.

01:06:00.119 --> 01:06:03.329
I forgot a 1/r here.
 

01:06:03.329 --> 01:06:10.177
That is the azimuthal magnetic
field around the wire that times

01:06:10.177 --> 01:06:12.940
ev is the force.
 

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.219
Because you can tell that no
matter where the charge was,

01:06:15.219 --> 01:06:17.489
whether it was here,
or whether it was there or

01:06:17.489 --> 01:06:20.349
anywhere around the wire it'll
have the same attraction.

01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:23.242
So you can deduce in the
laboratory frame there is an

01:06:23.242 --> 01:06:25.300
attractive force towards the
wire,

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:28.943
and that agrees with the exact
formula you got for the

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:29.768
magnetism.
 

01:06:29.768 --> 01:06:33.235
If you don't ignore the higher
powers of v^(2)/c^(2) you

01:06:33.235 --> 01:06:36.643
will find that the force in the
lab frame and the force in the

01:06:36.643 --> 01:06:38.880
moving frame are slightly
different.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:42.146
That's because in relativistic
theories the force is not the

01:06:42.146 --> 01:06:43.309
same for everybody.
 

01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:45.907
The force for me and the force
for you do not actually agree

01:06:45.907 --> 01:06:47.889
because time is not the same for
everybody.

01:06:47.889 --> 01:06:52.704
But the leading order in
v^(2)/c^(2) you can see

01:06:52.704 --> 01:06:53.329
this.
 

01:06:53.329 --> 01:06:55.789
There's only one thing I did
which is a little fudge,

01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:57.760
which you guys may not have
noticed,

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:01.661
is that the density here is
n_ ^(0)^(

01:07:01.661 --> 01:07:05.342
)whereas the actual current in
the lab is n_

01:07:05.342 --> 01:07:09.391
_ and the
two of them differ by this

01:07:09.391 --> 01:07:10.349
factor.
 

01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:13.833
However, if you have a
v^(2)/c^(2) in front of

01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:17.117
your expression and you've
ignored v^(4) or

01:07:17.117 --> 01:07:21.271
c^(4) there is no point
in keeping this guy here because

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:24.889
that makes an error of order
v^(4)/c^(4).

01:07:24.889 --> 01:07:27.583
If I'm going to keep that I
should go back right here and

01:07:27.583 --> 01:07:28.449
keep such terms.
 

01:07:28.449 --> 01:07:31.994
So the leading order you don't
have to worry about the

01:07:31.994 --> 01:07:33.599
difference in density.
 

01:07:33.599 --> 01:07:35.576
This is a very subtle
calculation because sometimes

01:07:35.576 --> 01:07:37.829
you worry about the difference
and sometimes you don't.

01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:41.036
So the rule always is if you're
trying to do calculations to a

01:07:41.036 --> 01:07:43.311
certain order,
namely v/c the whole

01:07:43.311 --> 01:07:46.128
thing squared then things that
make corrections of order

01:07:46.128 --> 01:07:48.329
v/c to the fourth can be
dropped.

01:07:48.329 --> 01:07:50.855
Anyway, I'm not that worried
about the details,

01:07:50.855 --> 01:07:54.039
but I want you to understand at
least what the logic is.

01:07:54.039 --> 01:07:56.110
That's more important.
 

01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:57.869
I know about electrostatics.
 

01:07:57.869 --> 01:08:01.480
I cleared the neutral current
carrying wire.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.913
It's neutral because the
negative charges are at rest at

01:08:04.913 --> 01:08:05.849
some density.
 

01:08:05.849 --> 01:08:09.264
The positive charges in the
moving rod are also at the same

01:08:09.264 --> 01:08:12.210
density, but the rest density is
somewhat lower.

01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:16.296
Then I predicted the particle
won't move because it's got no

01:08:16.296 --> 01:08:17.819
electric attraction.
 

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:20.172
Then I go to the rest frame of
the particle,

01:08:20.172 --> 01:08:23.184
then I find that the positive
charges have come to rest,

01:08:23.184 --> 01:08:25.210
and therefore to a lower
density.

01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:27.838
Negative charges are moving the
other way, therefore at the

01:08:27.838 --> 01:08:28.609
higher density.
 

01:08:28.609 --> 01:08:30.100
They no longer cancel.
 

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.350
The wire is charged.
 

01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:34.010
I expect this charge to be
attracted to the wire.

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:36.832
That means going back to the
lab I expect the moving charge

01:08:36.832 --> 01:08:39.704
also to be attracted to the wire
because when something goes

01:08:39.704 --> 01:08:42.381
towards the wire that goes
towards the wire according to

01:08:42.381 --> 01:08:43.210
all people.
 

01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:45.993
But you can go beyond and
actually compute the force and

01:08:45.993 --> 01:08:48.979
equate the force and deduce that
that is a new force now.

01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:51.442
Whenever you have a current
carrying wire with current

01:08:51.442 --> 01:08:54.565
I,
and that's a particle of charge

01:08:54.565 --> 01:08:59.617
e moving at speed v it
will be attracted to the wire by

01:08:59.617 --> 01:09:00.859
this amount.
 

01:09:00.859 --> 01:09:06.060
Okay, so I'll see you guys
after the break,

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:11.082
and my suggestion to you on
what to do with the break is to

01:09:11.082 --> 01:09:14.460
try to carry your textbook with
you,

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.640
and the textbook has got lots
of problems,

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.207
some of which are a lot simpler
than the one I gave in the early

01:09:20.207 --> 01:09:22.042
days,
but roughly the same level of

01:09:22.042 --> 01:09:23.328
difficulty as the midterm.
 

01:09:23.328 --> 01:09:25.779
And do as many problems as you
can.

01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:28.840
Look at the worked examples and
try to solve them.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:34.000

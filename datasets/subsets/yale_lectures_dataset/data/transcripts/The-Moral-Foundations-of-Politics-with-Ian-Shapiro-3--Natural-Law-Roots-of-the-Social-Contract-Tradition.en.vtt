00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.676
Prof: We're going to
start today by talking about the

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:07.829
Enlightenment,
and I want to offer one

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:13.461
prefatory caution about any way
of dividing up the history of

00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:16.588
ideas,
any way of periodizing,

00:00:16.588 --> 00:00:19.890
if you like,
the history of ideas,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.050
which is that there's no single
right way to do that,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.947
and indeed any way you do it
obscures in some ways important

00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:33.000
things.
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.790
So, for example,
sometimes people divide up the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.249
history of Western political
thought into the ancients and

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:40.220
the moderns.
 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.144
And the ancients are thought to
have certain characteristic

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.663
preoccupations that change
around sometime around the

00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:50.370
sixteenth century with
Machiavelli,

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.103
or in the seventeenth century
with some of the folks we're

00:00:55.103 --> 00:00:59.520
going to be talking about today,
and so we get this picture

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.655
presented that there's a
fundamental difference between

00:01:02.655 --> 00:01:04.049
ancients and moderns.
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.676
On the other hand,
another way of dividing up the

00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:11.453
history of the tradition is
between naturalists and

00:01:11.453 --> 00:01:13.040
anti-naturalists.
 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.872
So naturalists are people who
think that understanding nature

00:01:17.872 --> 00:01:22.141
and understanding human nature
is the key to political

00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:26.120
theorizing,
whereas anti-naturalists look

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.592
for something else,
whether it's God's law or

00:01:30.592 --> 00:01:36.040
transcendental platonic forms or
something like that.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.920
And so we can have a division
of the tradition between

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.680
naturalists who generally trace
all the way back to Aristotle,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.050
and anti-naturalists who trace
all the way back to Plato.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.959
It's not that the distinction
between naturalists and

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.812
anti-naturalists is better or
more accurate than the

00:01:56.812 --> 00:01:59.330
distinction between ancients and
moderns;

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.927
it's just a different kind of
distinction that highlights

00:02:02.927 --> 00:02:06.909
different features of these
thinkers for different purposes.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.812
So I just say that as a caution
because now we're focusing on

00:02:10.812 --> 00:02:14.197
the Enlightenment as a
characteristic move in Western

00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:17.775
political thinking that really
starts in the seventeenth

00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:21.938
century and comes into its own
in the eighteenth century,

00:02:21.938 --> 00:02:26.038
but I don't want you to reify
that idea.

00:02:26.038 --> 00:02:30.784
These Enlightenment thinkers
we're talking about do in fact

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:35.038
have important points of
continuity with medieval and

00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:39.241
ancient thinkers,
some of which will come up in

00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:40.650
our discussions.
 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.119
Nonetheless,
I think it's useful to focus on

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:48.073
the Enlightenment as a
distinctive term in Western

00:02:48.073 --> 00:02:51.980
political thinking,
and that's going to structure

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.020
our discussion going forward.
 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.181
And the first three traditions
we're going to consider in this

00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:59.464
course,
namely utilitarianism,

00:02:59.464 --> 00:03:03.554
Marxism, and the social
contract are all variants of

00:03:03.554 --> 00:03:05.639
Enlightenment thinking.
 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.813
But before we get into the
nitty-gritty of those

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:13.008
traditions,
I want us today to take a step

00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:19.182
back and think more generally
about what the Enlightenment

00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:22.324
was,
what this Enlightenment move is

00:03:22.324 --> 00:03:26.286
that I'm pointing to as setting
the outer philosophical

00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:30.760
boundaries of these first three
traditions that we're going to

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.990
be considering starting next
Wednesday.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.460
And as I said in my
introductory lecture,

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.357
the Enlightenment really
involves a twin commitment as

00:03:40.357 --> 00:03:45.425
far as politics is concerned,
and that is first and foremost

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:50.492
a commitment to science as the
basis for theorizing about

00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:51.580
politics.
 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:59.729
A commitment to science rather
than a commitment to tradition,

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.204
or religion,
or revelation,

00:04:03.204 --> 00:04:06.008
or anything else.
 

00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:10.931
Rather the idea was that
science is going to provide the

00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:15.674
right answers for thinking about
the correct political

00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:18.180
organization of society.
 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.728
And secondly,
the core political value for

00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:29.497
Enlightenment thinkers is this
notion of individual freedom to

00:04:29.497 --> 00:04:36.377
be operationalized or realized
through a doctrine of the rights

00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:39.040
of the individual.
 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.346
We'll see shortly that one of
the distinctive moves of the

00:04:43.346 --> 00:04:47.427
seventeenth-century writers
about politics is that they

00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:52.036
stopped talking so much about
natural law and start instead to

00:04:52.036 --> 00:04:56.901
talk about natural rights,
the rights of the individual to

00:04:56.901 --> 00:05:00.040
realize their purposes through
politics.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.040
And so the Enlightenment,
as I said,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.077
revolves around this twin
commitment to the idea of

00:05:07.077 --> 00:05:09.240
importance of science as the
basis for theorizing,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.730
and the importance of
individual freedoms realized

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.579
through a doctrine of individual
rights.

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:22.276
And we're going to use John
Locke as a window into this

00:05:22.276 --> 00:05:27.413
early Enlightenment thinking,
separately initially from his

00:05:27.413 --> 00:05:32.524
role as one of the early social
contract theorists that we'll be

00:05:32.524 --> 00:05:35.040
dealing with in a few weeks.
 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:41.050
But first we're going to focus
on this idea of science.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:48.040
Now, let's think about what
science is, what it's all about.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.502
I have three diagnostic
questions here,

00:05:51.502 --> 00:05:57.060
and the reason I put them up
will become plain in a second.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.250
It has to do with the fact that
the early Enlightenment

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.122
theorists,
the seventeenth-century

00:06:02.122 --> 00:06:05.000
theorists, thought that the
hallmark of genuine knowledge,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.040
the hallmark of science,
was certainty.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.180
You might all have come across
in one philosophy course or

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:21.000
another, the famous Cartesian
idea, Descartes' idea.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.214
Anyone read Descartes who can
tell us what he's most famous

00:06:25.214 --> 00:06:25.649
for?
 

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:30.310
Student: 
&gt;

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.791
Prof: Do what?
 

00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:31.778
Student: 
&gt;

00:06:31.778 --> 00:06:33.108
Prof: The Cogito did you
say?

00:06:33.108 --> 00:06:34.779
Student: 
&gt;

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:37.149
Prof: Yeah, Descartes.
 

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:38.879
What was his idea?
 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:44.600
Student: 
&gt;

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.072
Prof: Systematic doubt.
 

00:06:47.072 --> 00:06:48.639
You're dead right.
 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:53.055
Why was he interested in
doubting things,

00:06:53.055 --> 00:06:54.160
anybody?
 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.036
This is a bonus question
because Descartes is not on the

00:06:58.036 --> 00:07:01.774
syllabus, but why was he
interested in trying to doubt

00:07:01.774 --> 00:07:02.550
things?
 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.560
What was he looking for?
 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.910
Yeah?
 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.196
Student:  He was looking
for what you can truly be

00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:09.850
certain about.
 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.300
Prof: Exactly.
 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.110
He was looking for absolute
certainty;

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.569
that the hallmark of genuine
knowledge is certainty.

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:20.134
So he was asking himself,
"What is it that we can

00:07:20.134 --> 00:07:21.540
have certainty about?"
 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.110
And as you probably know,
Descartes had his own answer to

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.129
that question.
 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:27.329
What was it?
 

00:07:27.329 --> 00:07:29.220
Student:  "I think,
therefore I am."

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.790
Prof: Correct.
 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.240
I'm a Yalie,
therefore I am,

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.670
right?
 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.589
Yeah, "I think,
therefore I am."

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:41.430
And Descartes thought this was
a particular kind of proposition

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:46.800
because the very act of trying
to doubt it affirmed it.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.110
You couldn't doubt it.
 

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:54.668
And so that was what the early
Enlightenment theorists were

00:07:54.668 --> 00:07:56.009
looking for.
 

00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:58.790
What is it that makes knowledge
certain, puts it beyond doubt?

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.701
And so I've got up here three
propositions,

00:08:02.701 --> 00:08:08.288
and we could say the sum of the
interior angles of a triangle

00:08:08.288 --> 00:08:10.430
equals 180 degrees.
 

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:17.254
How many people think that that
proposition can be known with

00:08:17.254 --> 00:08:18.620
certainty?
 

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.858
Yeah, a lot,
I mean, how would you try and

00:08:20.858 --> 00:08:21.459
doubt it?
 

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.978
You could measure one triangle,
measure the next triangle,

00:08:24.978 --> 00:08:26.089
measure a third.
 

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:31.242
After you had measured 5,604
triangles you'd start to say,

00:08:31.242 --> 00:08:35.038
"Hum, maybe there's a
theorem here.

00:08:35.038 --> 00:08:40.586
It's not as if the next
triangle I find is going to turn

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:43.308
out not to add up to 180.
 

00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:46.019
It's just not going to happen,
right?

00:08:46.019 --> 00:08:49.577
We know, and that's what we've
come to refer to in modern

00:08:49.577 --> 00:08:53.009
philosophical thinking as a
priori knowledge.

00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:58.789
It follows from the nature of
the definitions,

00:08:58.789 --> 00:09:06.498
the nature of the terms that
the propositional force can't be

00:09:06.498 --> 00:09:08.038
doubted.
 

00:09:08.038 --> 00:09:09.990
So often we say a bachelor is
an unmarried man.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.166
You're not going to go and
start looking at bachelor after

00:09:14.166 --> 00:09:18.048
bachelor to see if you can find
a married bachelor.

00:09:18.048 --> 00:09:20.028
There's no such thing as a
married bachelor.

00:09:20.028 --> 00:09:23.517
So those propositions we tend
to think of today as analytic

00:09:23.517 --> 00:09:27.370
propositions;
they follow analytically from

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:32.763
the definitions of the terms at
issue, or in truths of

00:09:32.763 --> 00:09:34.288
mathematics.
 

00:09:34.288 --> 00:09:39.090
It seems there's a theorem that
tells you it must be the case

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.730
that the sum of the interior
angles of a triangle add up to

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.009
180 degrees.
 

00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:48.445
When we come to what I've
numbered two here,

00:09:48.445 --> 00:09:53.399
how many people think that that
can be known with certainty?

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:54.669
Some of you do.
 

00:09:54.669 --> 00:10:00.139
Anyone not so sure?
 

00:10:00.139 --> 00:10:01.620
Why are you unsure?
 

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.059
Where is the microphone?
 

00:10:03.059 --> 00:10:08.580
What's the source of your doubt?
 

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.139
Yeah, okay.
 

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:13.052
Student:  Well,
it seems like in terms of

00:10:13.052 --> 00:10:16.458
geology we weren't able to
penetrate what was underneath

00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:19.000
the earth for a long period of
time,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.780
and the knowledge of tectonic
plates even was a new or more

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.250
modern discovery,
I guess.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.465
Prof: Right,
so I think that's exactly

00:10:27.465 --> 00:10:28.048
right.
 

00:10:28.048 --> 00:10:31.607
The current best empirical
understanding of earthquakes is

00:10:31.607 --> 00:10:34.167
that it's the movement of
tectonic plates,

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.038
but science might advance.
 

00:10:36.038 --> 00:10:40.934
There might be changes in
geology, which might lead us

00:10:40.934 --> 00:10:43.494
eventually to learn,
"Well, yeah,

00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:44.899
some earthquakes result from
tectonic plate movement,

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:47.658
but other earthquakes might
result from something

00:10:47.658 --> 00:10:50.648
else," or we will learn
that something moves the

00:10:50.648 --> 00:10:53.808
tectonic plates that we don't
currently know about.

00:10:53.808 --> 00:10:59.139
This is an ongoing process of
empirical discovery,

00:10:59.139 --> 00:11:00.009
right?
 

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:03.216
It's not a proposition that
follows from the nature of the

00:11:03.216 --> 00:11:06.366
terms, and these we call
empirical propositions in modern

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:07.830
philosophy of science.
 

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.371
Sometimes they're called,
if you like the fancy Latin

00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:18.048
terminology, a posteriori
as opposed to a priori.

00:11:18.048 --> 00:11:20.458
They're not analytical
propositions,

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:21.009
right?
 

00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:25.851
They're a result of observation
and trying to figure out what

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:29.080
the causes are behind those
phenomena.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.105
So generally speaking they
don't have the same kind of

00:11:32.105 --> 00:11:33.990
force as analytic propositions.
 

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.100
What about this third one?
 

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.970
Consent is the basis for
political legitimacy.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:46.889
Anyone think that can be known
with certainty?

00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:50.860
Nobody.
 

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.710
I think that's right.
 

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.690
Most people would say,
"Well, that's a moral or

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:00.009
normative judgment of some kind.
 

00:12:00.009 --> 00:12:02.613
Maybe people agree with it,
maybe they don't,

00:12:02.613 --> 00:12:05.393
but certainly it's not a
scientific proposition,

00:12:05.393 --> 00:12:08.470
at least not obviously a
scientific proposition.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:15.048
Indeed, even if we took it just
in a descriptive sense,

00:12:15.048 --> 00:12:17.474
not to mean consent should be
the basis of political

00:12:17.474 --> 00:12:20.042
legitimacy,
but as a descriptive matter

00:12:20.042 --> 00:12:22.212
about regimes,
some people would say,

00:12:22.212 --> 00:12:25.847
"Well,
maybe regimes are based on

00:12:25.847 --> 00:12:27.816
consent,
but maybe some regimes are

00:12:27.816 --> 00:12:28.528
based on other things.
 

00:12:28.528 --> 00:12:31.720
Maybe they're based on claims
to divine authority.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.668
Maybe they're based on
utilitarianism."

00:12:34.668 --> 00:12:36.600
We're going to talk about that
next week.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.070
So it seems even as a
descriptive matter,

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.226
never mind as a normative
matter, this is not a scientific

00:12:45.226 --> 00:12:49.164
proposition in the way that
causal statements about the

00:12:49.164 --> 00:12:52.009
world are scientific
propositions,

00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:55.914
and certainly not in the way
that analytical statements about

00:12:55.914 --> 00:12:58.649
the world can have scientific
certainty.

00:12:58.649 --> 00:13:04.058
So we could spend more time on
this,

00:13:04.058 --> 00:13:08.424
and there are indeed nuances in
modern conceptions of science

00:13:08.424 --> 00:13:12.426
that I haven't gotten to that
would paint a more complex

00:13:12.426 --> 00:13:17.009
picture of the differences among
these three propositions,

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:21.327
but what I want to draw your
attention to now is that in the

00:13:21.327 --> 00:13:24.955
early Enlightenment,
seventeenth-century thinkers

00:13:24.955 --> 00:13:28.927
about the nature of science,
Descartes and his

00:13:28.927 --> 00:13:33.927
contemporaries,
thought very differently about

00:13:33.927 --> 00:13:37.279
science,
indeed.

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:42.321
In the early Enlightenment they
would have agreed that the sum

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:46.866
of interior angles of a triangle
equals 180 degrees is a

00:13:46.866 --> 00:13:51.000
proposition that can be known
with certainty,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.900
but interestingly they would
have put this claim here in the

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.960
same category.
 

00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.541
They would have put this claim
about consent in the same

00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:04.538
category with propositions about
mathematics,

00:14:04.538 --> 00:14:07.889
propositions behind which
there's a theorem,

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:10.470
as we just said when we were
talking about triangles,

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:18.383
and they would have relegated
empirical and causal claims to

00:14:18.383 --> 00:14:21.200
an inferior status.
 

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.840
Now, you might think that is
pretty weird.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:32.090
At least prima facie
that seems pretty weird.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.534
And in order to get your mind
into the world in which they

00:14:36.534 --> 00:14:40.668
lived you have to suspend
disbelief for a moment about

00:14:40.668 --> 00:14:45.347
your concept of science and try
to get your mind around early

00:14:45.347 --> 00:14:48.779
Enlightenment conceptions of
science,

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:53.080
which involved thinking very
differently.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.327
And the reason is that early
Enlightenment thinkers wouldn't

00:14:57.327 --> 00:15:02.009
say that this is certain because
of the meanings of the words,

00:15:02.009 --> 00:15:08.101
but rather it's certain because
there's an act of will behind

00:15:08.101 --> 00:15:08.610
it.
 

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.010
Now, this may sound even
weirder than anything I've said

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:16.330
so far,
but consider this passage here

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:22.057
written by Thomas Hobbes,
who is writing in the middle of

00:15:22.057 --> 00:15:25.980
the seventeenth century,
in a minor piece that he wrote,

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.308
Six Lessons for the
Professors of Mathematics.

00:15:29.308 --> 00:15:33.009
This is not one of Hobbes'
major works,

00:15:33.009 --> 00:15:36.221
but I think it's one of the
most succinct descriptions I've

00:15:36.221 --> 00:15:38.934
ever seen of the early
Enlightenment conception of

00:15:38.934 --> 00:15:39.600
science.
 

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.114
He says, "Of arts,"
(which for him is a general

00:15:43.114 --> 00:15:45.500
term to capture knowledge) he
says,

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.850
some are demonstrable,
others are indemonstrable;

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:54.145
and demonstrable are those the
construction of the subject

00:15:54.145 --> 00:15:58.700
whereof is in the power of the
artist himself,

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:03.105
who, in his demonstration,
does no more but to deduce the

00:16:03.105 --> 00:16:05.940
consequences of his own
operation.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:10.518
The reason whereof is this,
that the science of every

00:16:10.518 --> 00:16:15.096
subject is derived from a
precognition of the causes,

00:16:15.096 --> 00:16:19.058
generation, and construction of
the same;

00:16:19.058 --> 00:16:22.577
and consequently where the
causes are known,

00:16:22.577 --> 00:16:25.357
there is a place for
demonstration,

00:16:25.357 --> 00:16:29.038
but not where the causes are to
seek for.

00:16:29.038 --> 00:16:32.133
Geometry therefore is
demonstrable,

00:16:32.133 --> 00:16:37.500
for the lines and figures from
which we reason are drawn and

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.048
described by ourselves (we make
the triangle);

00:16:42.048 --> 00:16:46.476
and civil philosophy is
demonstrable,

00:16:46.476 --> 00:16:52.009
because we make the
commonwealth ourselves.

00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:57.182
Okay, so this is the key to
this what seems like a very

00:16:57.182 --> 00:17:02.547
weird conception of political
philosophy as equivalent to

00:17:02.547 --> 00:17:04.078
mathematics.
 

00:17:04.078 --> 00:17:05.929
"[C]ivil philosophy is
demonstrable,

00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:08.009
because we make the
commonwealth ourselves.

00:17:08.009 --> 00:17:10.500
But because of natural bodies
we know not the construction,

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:15.904
but seek it from the effects,
there lies no demonstration of

00:17:15.904 --> 00:17:20.940
what the causes be we seek for,
but only what they may be."

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.038
"Only what they may
be."

00:17:24.038 --> 00:17:26.462
There's not going to be
certainty about earthquakes,

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.078
about the causes of
earthquakes.

00:17:28.078 --> 00:17:32.009
We can make probabilistic
judgments.

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:36.375
We can make empirical claims,
but at the end of the day those

00:17:36.375 --> 00:17:39.423
claims are fallible,
they're corrigible,

00:17:39.423 --> 00:17:44.048
they might have to be revised
in the face of future knowledge,

00:17:44.048 --> 00:17:47.759
and science is not going to
ever reach to the level of

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:50.769
certainty with propositions of
that sort.

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:54.584
And so this is why,
going back to this,

00:17:54.584 --> 00:18:00.105
I did this ordering of these
propositions on a Hobbesian

00:18:00.105 --> 00:18:01.009
view.
 

00:18:01.009 --> 00:18:05.351
These two are equivalent not
because of anything about

00:18:05.351 --> 00:18:09.037
theorems or analytics,
but rather because this

00:18:09.037 --> 00:18:10.838
will-centeredness.
 

00:18:10.838 --> 00:18:17.009
They're the product of human
conscious action.

00:18:17.009 --> 00:18:22.060
We make the triangle and we
make the commonwealth,

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:27.833
and so we have privileged
access into what goes into that

00:18:27.833 --> 00:18:32.058
making, but we don't make the
planet.

00:18:32.058 --> 00:18:35.527
God made the planet and we can
only observe the effects of

00:18:35.527 --> 00:18:38.750
earthquakes and then try and
guess about their causes,

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.358
right?
 

00:18:39.358 --> 00:18:49.055
So when we come to John Locke,
who is at one with Hobbes on

00:18:49.055 --> 00:18:55.593
this point about knowledge,
the term I want to use to

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:59.249
capture this early Enlightenment
conception of science is the

00:18:59.249 --> 00:19:01.608
workmanship ideal,
right?

00:19:01.608 --> 00:19:06.786
Rather than a priori or
analytic knowledge we're going

00:19:06.786 --> 00:19:11.961
to talk about knowledge in terms
of this idea of workmanship,

00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:13.858
maker's knowledge.
 

00:19:13.858 --> 00:19:18.375
And it's important to realize
that in its ultimate

00:19:18.375 --> 00:19:23.720
foundations, this is actually a
theological proposition.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.256
Both for Hobbes,
we're going to leave Hobbes

00:19:26.256 --> 00:19:29.559
behind now because you didn't
read him and we're going to

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:32.275
focus on Locke,
but as I said,

00:19:32.275 --> 00:19:38.088
they have the same view on this
particular question.

00:19:38.088 --> 00:19:45.417
So God has intimate knowledge
of the universe because he

00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:47.950
created it, okay?
 

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:54.118
And that is this idea that
making is a source of knowledge,

00:19:54.118 --> 00:19:54.970
right?
 

00:19:54.970 --> 00:20:01.143
So God knows the causes of
earthquakes because he made the

00:20:01.143 --> 00:20:02.009
earth.
 

00:20:02.009 --> 00:20:07.202
We don't because we didn't make
the earth, but we can have

00:20:07.202 --> 00:20:12.578
God-like knowledge of what we
create because God gave us the

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:15.038
power to create things.
 

00:20:15.038 --> 00:20:18.689
So this is, in the first
instance, a theological

00:20:18.689 --> 00:20:20.009
argument, okay?
 

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:25.058
So we are like miniature gods
with respect to what we create.

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:29.577
We have the same kind of
maker's knowledge over what we

00:20:29.577 --> 00:20:33.009
create as God has over what he
created.

00:20:33.009 --> 00:20:37.650
Now, there are some constraints
on our kinds of knowing because

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.767
we are also made by God,
and I'm going to get to that in

00:20:41.767 --> 00:20:42.740
a minute.
 

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.920
But what he did for human
beings that he didn't do for any

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.828
other aspect of creation on
Locke's telling,

00:20:51.828 --> 00:20:56.009
is that he gave us this
creative capacity.

00:20:56.009 --> 00:20:59.193
He gave us the capacity to
behave like miniature gods in

00:20:59.193 --> 00:21:01.509
the world, and I'll come back to
that.

00:21:01.509 --> 00:21:08.240
But I did want to alert you to
the fact that for Locke this was

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.798
actually something of a
tormenting idea.

00:21:12.798 --> 00:21:17.663
We'll hear a lot more about
Locke later, but one of the most

00:21:17.663 --> 00:21:22.526
important things you need to
remember about Locke is that he

00:21:22.526 --> 00:21:24.009
was a Thomist.
 

00:21:24.009 --> 00:21:26.490
He was a believing Christian
theologian throughout his life.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:32.018
And there was a huge debate
that had gone on actually for

00:21:32.018 --> 00:21:38.038
two centuries before Locke
wrote among theologians,

00:21:38.038 --> 00:21:39.740
and this was the puzzle that
they were worried about.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.118
 
 

00:21:44.118 --> 00:21:49.416
The question was,
"Can God change natural

00:21:49.416 --> 00:21:50.828
law?"
 

00:21:50.828 --> 00:21:58.186
If you said no,
that would suggest that God is

00:21:58.186 --> 00:22:03.259
not omnipotent,
but if you said yes,

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:09.862
that would suggest that natural
law is not a system of timeless

00:22:09.862 --> 00:22:14.308
universals,
because if God could change

00:22:14.308 --> 00:22:20.009
natural law maybe he'll choose
to change it tomorrow.

00:22:20.009 --> 00:22:23.009
And as we were talking about on
Wednesday,

00:22:23.009 --> 00:22:25.680
remember when somebody asked me
about legal positivism,

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.811
I said that that was a doctrine
that had rejected the idea of

00:22:30.811 --> 00:22:32.009
natural law.
 

00:22:32.009 --> 00:22:35.843
The idea of natural law was
that there are some timeless

00:22:35.843 --> 00:22:39.884
universals that we can appeal
to, to judge actual political

00:22:39.884 --> 00:22:41.068
institutions.
 

00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:45.997
So we can appeal to natural law
in the context of the Eichmann

00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:50.602
problem we were discussing to
say that Nazi Germany was an

00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:52.460
evil regime, right?
 

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.098
We appeal to this higher
natural law.

00:22:55.098 --> 00:23:00.605
Well, Locke had been concerned
about this theological problem

00:23:00.605 --> 00:23:06.297
with natural law that if you say
it's a timeless universal that

00:23:06.297 --> 00:23:11.711
seems to undermine the idea of
God's omnipotence because God

00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:15.200
can't be an all-powerful figure.
 

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.076
But if on the other hand you
say, well, God can change

00:23:20.076 --> 00:23:25.690
natural law then that undermines
its possible universality.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.368
And Locke struggled with this.
 

00:23:27.368 --> 00:23:31.469
If you become experts on the
seventeenth century and you go

00:23:31.469 --> 00:23:35.637
back and read his essays on the
law of nature written in the

00:23:35.637 --> 00:23:39.666
1660s you'll see him really
torturing himself as to how to

00:23:39.666 --> 00:23:41.009
resolve this.
 

00:23:41.009 --> 00:23:44.704
He never really resolved it,
but in the end he came down on

00:23:44.704 --> 00:23:47.700
what we're going to call the
command theory,

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.920
the workmanship theory,
the well-based theory that--

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.653
he said, "We have to say
that God is omnipotent and let

00:23:56.653 --> 00:24:01.465
the chips fall where they may
for the timelessness of natural

00:24:01.465 --> 00:24:02.588
law."
 

00:24:02.588 --> 00:24:05.755
He was never entirely
comfortable with it,

00:24:05.755 --> 00:24:10.233
but he couldn't let go of that
proposition for reasons I've

00:24:10.233 --> 00:24:13.645
already alluded to;
that he thought something

00:24:13.645 --> 00:24:17.705
couldn't have the force of a law
without being the product of a

00:24:17.705 --> 00:24:18.230
will.
 

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:22.404
And so it's God's will that's
the basis of natural law in

00:24:22.404 --> 00:24:26.020
God's case,
and God's knowledge of his

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:32.349
creation is traced back to this
idea of the workmanship ideal,

00:24:32.349 --> 00:24:34.048
maker's knowledge.
 

00:24:34.048 --> 00:24:37.660
So God has maker's knowledge of
his creation.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:45.038
We're going to see two
important other features,

00:24:45.038 --> 00:24:48.148
additional features of this
workmanship ideal that I'm just

00:24:48.148 --> 00:24:50.828
going to mention now and then
I'll come back to.

00:24:50.828 --> 00:24:56.257
One is that it translates over
also into normative

00:24:56.257 --> 00:24:58.140
considerations.
 

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.303
That is to say,
not only does God have

00:25:01.303 --> 00:25:05.576
workman's knowledge,
creator's knowledge of what he

00:25:05.576 --> 00:25:09.509
creates, but he also owns what
he creates.

00:25:09.509 --> 00:25:12.140
He has rights over his creation.
 

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.599
We are God's property because
he created us.

00:25:16.599 --> 00:25:18.880
The world is God's property.
 

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.680
The universe is God's property.
 

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.288
You own what you make.
 

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:26.596
God made everything,
so ultimately God owns

00:25:26.596 --> 00:25:27.618
everything.
 

00:25:27.618 --> 00:25:32.915
And just as we can behave as
miniature gods in understanding

00:25:32.915 --> 00:25:36.866
our creation,
we can also behave as miniature

00:25:36.866 --> 00:25:39.740
gods in owning what we make.
 

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.090
So we will see later this
affects his theory of property

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:46.230
and his theory of the state,
because we're going to have

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.038
rights over the state which we
create.

00:25:48.038 --> 00:25:51.140
We're going to get to all of
that later, okay?

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.700
But so it's a unified theory,
this workmanship ideal,

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:59.523
that goes both to the question
of knowledge and to the question

00:25:59.523 --> 00:26:02.653
of ownership,
rights, entitlements,

00:26:02.653 --> 00:26:07.410
everything is traced back to
this workmanship ideal.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:11.920
The second point that I'm just
going to mention now and will

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.545
come up later,
it'll come up most dramatically

00:26:17.545 --> 00:26:24.903
when we come to consider Marx,
is that what gave Locke's

00:26:24.903 --> 00:26:31.619
theory its internal coherence
was that it was a theological

00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:33.009
argument.
 

00:26:33.009 --> 00:26:36.941
None of this really makes any
sense unless you start from this

00:26:36.941 --> 00:26:40.548
proposition that God created the
universe and has maker's

00:26:40.548 --> 00:26:44.029
knowledge and maker's authority
over the universe.

00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:45.740
Everything flows from that.
 

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:51.364
As I said, in Locke's
understanding he gave us this

00:26:51.364 --> 00:26:57.775
unique capacity to create as
well, but we're answerable to

00:26:57.775 --> 00:27:02.048
him in ways that'll come up
later.

00:27:02.048 --> 00:27:06.102
But none of this makes sense
without the theological

00:27:06.102 --> 00:27:08.009
assumptions behind it.
 

00:27:08.009 --> 00:27:12.807
One of the big projects of the
Enlightenment which is going to

00:27:12.807 --> 00:27:17.368
concern us one way or another
throughout the course is what

00:27:17.368 --> 00:27:22.009
happens if you try to secularize
the workmanship ideal.

00:27:22.009 --> 00:27:25.366
That is to say,
you'll see in the labor theory

00:27:25.366 --> 00:27:29.615
of value that Marx embraces,
which is at the core of his

00:27:29.615 --> 00:27:33.391
political theory,
and modern social contract

00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:38.029
theorists like Nozick and Rawls
and many others,

00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:43.593
what you're going to find is
that people want to hold onto

00:27:43.593 --> 00:27:47.009
this basic structure of
thinking.

00:27:47.009 --> 00:27:50.192
People find this workmanship
ideal intuitively very

00:27:50.192 --> 00:27:53.133
appealing,
but they're going to try and

00:27:53.133 --> 00:27:57.510
detach it from its theological
moorings because they either

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:01.663
don't believe the theological
argument for one reason or

00:28:01.663 --> 00:28:04.994
another,
or they find it problematic,

00:28:04.994 --> 00:28:09.627
or they want to convince people
that this idea that making

00:28:09.627 --> 00:28:14.585
creates ownership is powerful
and important regardless of your

00:28:14.585 --> 00:28:16.778
religious convictions.
 

00:28:16.778 --> 00:28:20.977
And so one of the big
challenges and projects of the

00:28:20.977 --> 00:28:25.009
Enlightenment is going to turn
out to be: how,

00:28:25.009 --> 00:28:29.390
if at all, can we retain the
structure of the workmanship

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:33.380
ideal while shedding its
theological foundations?

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:38.029
But that's getting ahead of
ourselves.

00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:41.500
So what I want the takeaway
point for today to be is that

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.970
this is the early Enlightenment
conception of science.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:52.088
It's a workmanship ideal that
appeals to certainty,

00:28:52.088 --> 00:28:55.459
which was the Cartesian
preoccupation and the Hobbesian

00:28:55.459 --> 00:28:58.770
preoccupation,
but it does it in a different

00:28:58.770 --> 00:28:59.160
way.
 

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.217
It doesn't look for what we
today think of as analytic

00:29:02.217 --> 00:29:04.820
propositions,
rather it looks for

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:09.686
propositions that can be known
with certainty because we

00:29:09.686 --> 00:29:15.173
introspect into our own will and
understand with certainty what

00:29:15.173 --> 00:29:19.349
we have created,
okay?

00:29:19.349 --> 00:29:26.009
 
 

00:29:26.009 --> 00:29:30.048
And now let's start to
transition to talking about

00:29:30.048 --> 00:29:31.779
individual rights,
 

00:29:31.779 --> 00:29:35.420
 
 

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.588
and we do this by moving from
God's knowledge of his creation

00:29:39.588 --> 00:29:42.160
to God's ownership of his
creation.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:49.490
Just to sum up this workmanship
ideal, Locke says,

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.930
The state of nature has a law
of nature to govern it,

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.348
which obliges every one:
and reason,

00:29:55.348 --> 00:29:57.519
which is that law,
teaches all mankind,

00:29:57.519 --> 00:30:00.460
who will but consult it,
that being all equal and

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.032
independent,
no one ought to harm another in

00:30:03.032 --> 00:30:04.640
his life,
health, liberty,

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.530
or possessions (I'll come back
to that): for men being all the

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:12.730
workmanship of one omnipotent,
and infinitely wise maker;

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.105
all the servants of one
sovereign master,

00:30:15.105 --> 00:30:18.608
sent into the world by his
order, and about his business;

00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:24.048
they are his property,
whose workmanship they are,

00:30:24.048 --> 00:30:26.170
made to last during his,
not during one another's

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:28.288
pleasure: and being furnished
with faculties,

00:30:28.288 --> 00:30:30.868
sharing all in one community of
nature,

00:30:30.868 --> 00:30:34.558
there cannot be supposed any
such subordination among us,

00:30:34.558 --> 00:30:37.470
that may authorize us to
destroy one another,

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:42.500
as if we were made for one
another's uses,

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:47.308
as the inferior ranks and
creatures are for ours.

00:30:47.308 --> 00:30:56.857
So this idea should give you a
sense in which Locke's theory of

00:30:56.857 --> 00:31:06.098
individual rights are basic and
are rooted in the workmanship

00:31:06.098 --> 00:31:07.640
ideal.
 

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:13.088
We are God's creations.
 

00:31:13.088 --> 00:31:16.236
We are his property and that
means, as he says here,

00:31:16.236 --> 00:31:18.519
we can't be one another's
property.

00:31:18.519 --> 00:31:20.308
We can't own one another.
 

00:31:20.308 --> 00:31:23.757
You might say,
"Well, don't parents make

00:31:23.757 --> 00:31:25.088
their children?
 

00:31:25.088 --> 00:31:31.028
Don't parents own their
children?"

00:31:31.028 --> 00:31:34.462
and indeed, Sir Robert Filmer,
who Locke was arguing against

00:31:34.462 --> 00:31:37.256
in the first treatise,
took exactly the view that

00:31:37.256 --> 00:31:39.058
parents own their children.
 

00:31:39.058 --> 00:31:45.712
But Filmer had a very different
conception of the theological

00:31:45.712 --> 00:31:49.038
foundations of the universe.
 

00:31:49.038 --> 00:31:54.576
Filmer, who was a defender of
absolutism, Filmer said God gave

00:31:54.576 --> 00:32:00.295
the world to Adam and his heirs
through a system of primogenitor

00:32:00.295 --> 00:32:02.019
or inheritance.
 

00:32:02.019 --> 00:32:03.526
And so there were a lot of
folks running around in

00:32:03.526 --> 00:32:05.569
seventeenth-century England,
for example,

00:32:05.569 --> 00:32:10.012
saying, "Well,
if you pay me I can prove that

00:32:10.012 --> 00:32:15.078
you're a closer descendent of
Adam than the next guy."

00:32:15.078 --> 00:32:20.038
This was the notion that the
lineage to Adam was important,

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:23.647
and indeed that the Kings and
Queens of Europe got their

00:32:23.647 --> 00:32:27.519
political authority because they
were the most direct living

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:29.618
descendants of Adam and Eve.
 

00:32:29.618 --> 00:32:33.576
So it was this idea God gave
the world to Adam,

00:32:33.576 --> 00:32:38.048
and he to his children,
and children and children.

00:32:38.048 --> 00:32:42.545
And in absolutist thought they
took very serious the idea that

00:32:42.545 --> 00:32:46.597
parents own their children and
can indeed sell them into

00:32:46.597 --> 00:32:50.430
slavery or worse because they're
their property.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:55.296
Locke says, "No,
God makes the child and uses

00:32:55.296 --> 00:32:59.068
the parents as his
instrument."

00:32:59.068 --> 00:33:04.275
The parents simply act out an
urge that's implanted in them,

00:33:04.275 --> 00:33:09.038
but they can't fashion the
intricacies of the child.

00:33:09.038 --> 00:33:10.784
And, of course,
they can't put a soul in the

00:33:10.784 --> 00:33:13.432
child,
so the child is God's creation

00:33:13.432 --> 00:33:22.037
and we are all God's creation,
unlike the view developed by

00:33:22.037 --> 00:33:23.798
Filmer.
 

00:33:23.798 --> 00:33:29.171
And so when we think about the
doctrine of individual rights

00:33:29.171 --> 00:33:34.815
the first thing to see is that
this workmanship idea gives us a

00:33:34.815 --> 00:33:40.095
fundamental different status
than anything that had existed

00:33:40.095 --> 00:33:44.009
before in Western political
thinking.

00:33:44.009 --> 00:33:48.310
Because we are created by God,
we are all equal in the sight

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:50.894
of God,
and we have the capacity to

00:33:50.894 --> 00:33:54.538
function as miniature gods
because of this capacity to

00:33:54.538 --> 00:34:00.940
create things that we have,
right?

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:05.220
Secondly we're all equal before
God.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:12.882
We're equal, as he says here,
Whether we consider natural

00:34:12.882 --> 00:34:15.358
reason,
which tells us that men being

00:34:15.358 --> 00:34:19.699
once born have a right to their
preservation and consequently to

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:22.637
meat and drink,
and other such things as nature

00:34:22.637 --> 00:34:25.632
affords their subsistence:
or revelation which gives us an

00:34:25.632 --> 00:34:28.679
account of those grants God made
of the world to Adam,

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:30.706
and to Noah,
and his sons,

00:34:30.706 --> 00:34:34.121
it is very clear that God,
as king David says,

00:34:34.121 --> 00:34:36.579
has given the earth to the
children of men;

00:34:36.579 --> 00:34:39.719
given it to mankind in common.
 

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:47.050
So we are all equally created
by God.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:51.989
We all have the same rights to
the common as everybody else and

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:57.010
there's no sense in which it's
Adam and his heirs that have--

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:03.614
there's no sense that Adam and
his heirs have some kind of

00:35:03.614 --> 00:35:04.889
priority.
 

00:35:04.889 --> 00:35:10.650
 
 

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:18.414
Thirdly, it's very important
for Locke, and a very radical

00:35:18.414 --> 00:35:25.088
move to say that there is no
authoritative earthly

00:35:25.088 --> 00:35:29.719
interpreter of the scriptures.
 

00:35:29.719 --> 00:35:34.789
Anyone guess why I might say
that?

00:35:34.789 --> 00:35:41.172
There may be ambiguities in
what the scriptures mean,

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:49.030
and one person says it means X
and one person says it means Y.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.940
Okay, we have a volunteer over
there.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.206
Why is it important for Locke
to say that nobody on earth can

00:35:55.206 --> 00:35:57.269
settle those disagreements?
 

00:35:57.269 --> 00:36:00.460
 
 

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.764
Student:  Because that
person would supposedly be

00:36:03.764 --> 00:36:07.130
closer to God being an
interpreter of the word of God.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.420
Prof: Right.
 

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.021
That person would set
themselves up as being closer to

00:36:12.021 --> 00:36:16.099
the word of God being the
interpreter of the word of God.

00:36:16.099 --> 00:36:17.849
"[E]very man ought
sincerely to inquire into

00:36:17.849 --> 00:36:19.621
himself by meditation,
study, search,

00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:22.579
and his own endeavors attain
the knowledge of,

00:36:22.579 --> 00:36:26.400
cannot be looked upon as a
peculiar..."

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.570
I'm sorry. I'm misreading.
 

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.751
"[Those things that]
every man ought sincerely to

00:36:29.751 --> 00:36:32.445
inquire into himself,
and by meditation,

00:36:32.445 --> 00:36:36.518
study, search,
and his own endeavours attain

00:36:36.518 --> 00:36:39.181
knowledge of,
cannot be looked upon as the

00:36:39.181 --> 00:36:40.909
peculiar possession of any sort
of men."

00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:46.030
I think a word has been dropped
there,

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:50.920
but the meaning of it is that
authoritative knowledge can't be

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.010
the peculiar possession of any
particular person.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:58.661
"Princes,
indeed, are superior to men in

00:36:58.661 --> 00:37:01.070
power, but in nature equal.
 

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:04.385
Neither the right nor the art
of ruling does necessary carry

00:37:04.385 --> 00:37:07.418
along with it the certain
knowledge of other things and

00:37:07.418 --> 00:37:09.329
least of all of true religion.
 

00:37:09.329 --> 00:37:12.699
For if it were so,
how could it come to pass that

00:37:12.699 --> 00:37:16.842
the lords of the earth should
differ so vastly as they do in

00:37:16.842 --> 00:37:18.809
religious matters?"
 

00:37:18.809 --> 00:37:24.878
So political leaders differ
with one another about religious

00:37:24.878 --> 00:37:29.112
matters,
and that itself tells you that

00:37:29.112 --> 00:37:35.112
you can't rely on anybody to
settle them because nobody has

00:37:35.112 --> 00:37:41.630
more privileged access than
anybody else to God's knowledge.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:45.617
So it's the beginning of what
we will later come to refer to

00:37:45.617 --> 00:37:49.201
as a Lutheran idea of the
relationship between man and

00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:52.052
God,
but the idea is that everyone

00:37:52.052 --> 00:37:55.300
must read the scriptures for
themselves,

00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:00.300
and if God wants to speak to
you he will speak through the

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.672
scriptures,
and if somebody else reads them

00:38:03.672 --> 00:38:07.023
differently,
nobody on earth can settle that

00:38:07.023 --> 00:38:08.099
disagreement.
 

00:38:08.099 --> 00:38:11.579
Nobody has the right to settle
that disagreement.

00:38:11.579 --> 00:38:16.670
Everybody must settle it for
themself.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:22.538
And that's going to turn out to
be hugely important in politics

00:38:22.538 --> 00:38:27.742
because if people start to
believe that the ruler of the

00:38:27.742 --> 00:38:31.340
society is violating natural
law,

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:35.824
there's nobody who can say they
don't have the right to hold

00:38:35.824 --> 00:38:36.889
that belief.
 

00:38:36.889 --> 00:38:42.907
What it means they can do in
practice is another matter that

00:38:42.907 --> 00:38:45.050
we'll get to later.
 

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:47.746
So it's going to provide the
basis for the right to resist

00:38:47.746 --> 00:38:50.396
the authority of the state,
the right to resist sovereign

00:38:50.396 --> 00:38:51.059
authority.
 

00:38:51.059 --> 00:38:55.070
When we think about the
Eichmann problem again,

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:58.329
then you are ordered to do
something,

00:38:58.329 --> 00:39:00.518
to send people to a
concentration camp,

00:39:00.518 --> 00:39:05.090
and you read the scriptures,
and you say,

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:08.568
"Well, my reading of the
Bible tells me that this is

00:39:08.568 --> 00:39:12.418
wrong," there is no earthly
authority who has the right to

00:39:12.418 --> 00:39:13.599
contradict you.
 

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:17.639
Tremendously important
philosophical move with huge

00:39:17.639 --> 00:39:19.659
political consequences.
 

00:39:19.659 --> 00:39:24.570
Of course there was another
consideration here.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:30.235
Who knows--it was not just the
disagreements among the kings

00:39:30.235 --> 00:39:35.137
and queens of Europe,
but who else might Locke have

00:39:35.137 --> 00:39:40.873
been thinking about in the 1680s
not wanting to give authority to

00:39:40.873 --> 00:39:44.010
for interpreting the scriptures?
 

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:49.173
Some history major,
what was going on in England in

00:39:49.173 --> 00:39:52.789
the 1670s and '80s,
anybody know?

00:39:52.789 --> 00:39:53.889
Who were they worried about?
 

00:39:53.889 --> 00:39:58.159
Not just the different kings
competing and authorities--yeah?

00:39:58.159 --> 00:39:59.545
Student:  The Papacy?.
 

00:39:59.545 --> 00:40:00.980
Prof: The Pope,
yeah.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:02.039
Okay, we don't need the mic.
 

00:40:02.039 --> 00:40:03.869
The Pope, of course.
 

00:40:03.869 --> 00:40:10.097
You will see when you come to
read Locke's letter on

00:40:10.097 --> 00:40:17.059
toleration that he has a very
wide view of toleration,

00:40:17.059 --> 00:40:19.570
but he doesn't think that
Catholics should be tolerated.

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:21.699
We'll get to why later.
 

00:40:21.699 --> 00:40:27.471
But the reason here would be
that the Pope sets himself up as

00:40:27.471 --> 00:40:33.626
the authoritative interpreter of
the scripture and you can't have

00:40:33.626 --> 00:40:35.070
that, okay?
 

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:38.545
You have to have something like
what we would call today a

00:40:38.545 --> 00:40:40.010
disestablished church.
 

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:44.039
And indeed that takes us to a
fourth source of individual

00:40:44.039 --> 00:40:48.211
rights in Locke's thinking,
namely that every individual is

00:40:48.211 --> 00:40:49.219
sovereign.
 

00:40:49.219 --> 00:40:55.336
The care of souls cannot belong
to the civil magistrate,

00:40:55.336 --> 00:41:01.010
because his power consists only
in outward force;

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.217
but true and saving religion
consists in the inward

00:41:04.217 --> 00:41:07.487
persuasion of the mind,
without which nothing can be

00:41:07.487 --> 00:41:08.900
acceptable to God.
 

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.771
And such is the nature of the
understanding,

00:41:11.771 --> 00:41:15.447
that it cannot be compelled to
the belief of anything by

00:41:15.447 --> 00:41:16.650
outward force.
 

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:18.411
[...]
And upon this ground,

00:41:18.411 --> 00:41:22.074
I affirm that the magistrate's
power extends not to the

00:41:22.074 --> 00:41:24.989
establishing of any articles of
faith,

00:41:24.989 --> 00:41:29.230
or forms of worship,
by the force of his laws.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:33.018
For laws are of no force at all
without penalties,

00:41:33.018 --> 00:41:39.050
and penalties in this case are
absolutely impertinent,

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:42.170
because they're not proper to
convince the mind.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:47.306
The state can control your
behavior, but it can't make you

00:41:47.306 --> 00:41:49.018
believe anything.
 

00:41:49.018 --> 00:41:54.289
And this is the source of his
objection to any earthly

00:41:54.289 --> 00:41:59.757
authority being in the position
to dictate what religion

00:41:59.757 --> 00:42:05.157
requires,
whether it's the king or the

00:42:05.157 --> 00:42:07.018
Pope, right?
 

00:42:07.018 --> 00:42:10.197
There is no authoritative
interpretation of the scriptures

00:42:10.197 --> 00:42:11.090
in this world.
 

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:14.190
Tremendously important move.
 

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:20.760
So just to summarize;
we have this workmanship idea

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:25.275
that informs the early
Enlightenment conception of

00:42:25.275 --> 00:42:26.289
science.
 

00:42:26.289 --> 00:42:31.318
It's preoccupied with
certainty, and it's rooted in

00:42:31.318 --> 00:42:37.150
this creationist theory of
knowledge that we have workman's

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:40.469
knowledge of our workmanship.
 

00:42:40.469 --> 00:42:45.121
It also translates over into
the theory of rights because

00:42:45.121 --> 00:42:49.523
just as we have workman's
knowledge of our creation we

00:42:49.523 --> 00:42:54.010
also have a workman's authority
over his creation.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:56.909
We own what we make just as we
know what we make.

00:42:56.909 --> 00:43:06.980
Secondly we own the right to
the world's--

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.965
what he's going to later call
"the waste of God,"

00:43:09.965 --> 00:43:11.869
what's given to mankind in
common,

00:43:11.869 --> 00:43:16.900
just as little or as much as
everybody else.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:24.438
There is nobody who has a prior
claim on the property out there,

00:43:24.438 --> 00:43:27.309
the animals,
the land;

00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:32.010
everything that's in God's
creation.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:35.949
We all have the right to use it
and nobody has the right to stop

00:43:35.949 --> 00:43:38.199
anybody else from using it,
right?

00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:40.018
We didn't make it so we don't
own it.

00:43:40.018 --> 00:43:43.190
God made it and he gave it to
us in common.

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:50.992
This is in contradiction of
Filmer's view that he gave it to

00:43:50.992 --> 00:43:53.940
Adam,
and Adam's heirs have inherited

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:57.416
both the goods and property in
the world and the political

00:43:57.416 --> 00:44:00.159
authority in the world directly
from Adam.

00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:07.784
So it's this basic idea that we
have common rights to the

00:44:07.784 --> 00:44:12.960
creation that God has put before
us.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:17.693
Third, we have equal access to
the word of God,

00:44:17.693 --> 00:44:22.943
and that's really important
because the word of God,

00:44:22.943 --> 00:44:28.090
or natural law is what binds
all human beings.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:31.409
We're all his creation and
natural law is the expression of

00:44:31.409 --> 00:44:32.039
his will.
 

00:44:32.039 --> 00:44:38.063
We have to obey it,
but what if we don't agree

00:44:38.063 --> 00:44:41.010
about what it means?
 

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.119
What if we don't agree about
what it means?

00:44:43.119 --> 00:44:45.480
That's what the second treatise
is about.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:50.175
We're going to talk about that
in a few weeks,

00:44:50.175 --> 00:44:51.010
right?
 

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:54.992
But the important point here is
the sovereign doesn't have any

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:57.800
right to declare what natural
law means,

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.516
or the magistrate to compel us
to believe the received

00:45:02.516 --> 00:45:04.030
interpretation.
 

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:08.710
And finally each individual is
sovereign over himself because

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:11.518
"true and saving
religion,"

00:45:11.518 --> 00:45:14.302
as he puts it,
consists of "inward

00:45:14.302 --> 00:45:15.929
persuasion of the mind."
 

00:45:15.929 --> 00:45:21.043
You can't be made to believe
things and it's your authentic

00:45:21.043 --> 00:45:25.010
belief that something is the
right answer,

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:29.010
which is essential to its being
the right answer.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:34.018
And this is going to supply the
basis for the right to resist,

00:45:34.018 --> 00:45:39.112
the right to resist the
authority of the state that is

00:45:39.112 --> 00:45:44.492
ultimately the right on which
Locke's political theory is

00:45:44.492 --> 00:45:46.030
constructed.
 

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:50.313
So this workmanship ideal
informs the theory of knowledge

00:45:50.313 --> 00:45:54.519
and the theory of rights,
and we're going to see that it

00:45:54.519 --> 00:45:56.050
doesn't go away.
 

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:59.690
People try to secularize it,
and we're going to explore the

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:03.268
ways in which that they do that
at considerable length.

00:46:03.268 --> 00:46:11.050
But they try to modify it as
well, but it doesn't go away.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:14.282
And you'll see that one of the
reasons it doesn't go away is

00:46:14.282 --> 00:46:18.811
that problematic as it might be,
and there are many problems

00:46:18.811 --> 00:46:20.893
with it,
very few people,

00:46:20.893 --> 00:46:26.219
very few people in this room,
I will bet, are going to ever

00:46:26.219 --> 00:46:29.389
want to give it up entirely.
 

00:46:29.389 --> 00:46:32.927
Okay, so we'll start next
Wednesday with classical

00:46:32.927 --> 00:46:36.175
utilitarianism,
the first of our Enlightenment

00:46:36.175 --> 00:46:37.260
traditions.
 

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.400
See you then.
 

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:43.000

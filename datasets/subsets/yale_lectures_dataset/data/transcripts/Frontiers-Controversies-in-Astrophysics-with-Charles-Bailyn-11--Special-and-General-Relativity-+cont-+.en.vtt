00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.671
Professor Charles
Bailyn: We were talking

00:00:02.671 --> 00:00:05.232
about relativity.
And where we ended up last

00:00:05.232 --> 00:00:09.248
time--we were talking about
special relativity and all the

00:00:09.248 --> 00:00:12.490
weird things that happen to
space and time.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.851
And the question arose,
you know, what prompted

00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:18.410
Einstein to think these
thoughts?

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.480
And we talked a little bit
about the fact that the speed of

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.551
light is always the same no
matter what the velocity of the

00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:29.570
person observing it and how
that--then,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.228
if you take that literally,
it tells you that space and

00:00:33.228 --> 00:00:35.870
time are weird,
and are not constant and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.410
absolute the way you might think
they are in a Newtonian sense,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.870
but vary according to the
velocity of the observer and in

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.720
these various ways having to do
with that parameter gamma.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.396
And so, Einstein's great stroke
of genius was not to try and fix

00:00:56.396 --> 00:01:00.479
up these little problems with
the experiment in some,

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.668
sort of, patchwork kind of way,
or to try and invoke a minor

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:08.906
change in the laws of nature,
but to recognize that this was

00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:12.096
a very big deal,
and that would involve changing

00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:15.489
fundamentally how we think space
and time work.

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:19.030
So, this is a very famous fable
of science, you know.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.174
This is the thing where
Einstein is a young man,

00:01:24.174 --> 00:01:28.756
and he's sort of a rebel.
And he refuses to take his exam

00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:30.540
and he pisses off his
professors.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.739
And the consequence is he
doesn't get a good job.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:37.025
And he gets this job at the
patent office right,

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:40.101
in Bern, Switzerland,
where he labors away in

00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:42.357
obscurity.
And then, suddenly,

00:01:42.357 --> 00:01:45.989
in a blaze of glory in 1905,
he publishes three papers,

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:48.410
one of which is about
relativity,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.184
one of which is the start of
quantum mechanics,

00:01:51.184 --> 00:01:54.140
and the other of which proves
that atoms exist.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.516
And so, these are three of the
greatest papers of all time,

00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:00.835
published in a single year,
by some clown who's a clerk in

00:02:00.835 --> 00:02:02.910
a patent office.
All right.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.599
Very big deal.
This happened in 1905,

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.269
two years ago it was the
hundredth anniversary of this.

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:10.151
This was declared Einstein
Year, and all sorts of fuss was

00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:12.335
made about it.
So, there are various morals

00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:15.481
that can be drawn from this.
And I'm going to draw several

00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:18.391
of them in what you might call
increasing order of

00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:21.616
sophistication.
So, the low sophistication

00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:25.182
moral, moral number one,
here, is, you know,

00:02:25.182 --> 00:02:30.706
about the genius in obscurity.
A genius in obscurity can

00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:33.270
revolutionize science.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.800
This is a very dangerous way to
approach the Einstein story.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.636
Because it--you know,
it's really easy to convince

00:02:44.636 --> 00:02:47.300
yourself that you are a genius
in obscurity.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.772
Many people have convinced
themselves that they are

00:02:50.772 --> 00:02:53.124
geniuses in obscurity.
I know about this,

00:02:53.124 --> 00:02:56.295
because they send me email.
And they explain to me in their

00:02:56.295 --> 00:02:59.419
email that they send me--and
this happens to,

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.731
you know, any scientist,
particularly someone working in

00:03:02.731 --> 00:03:05.921
astrophysics or fundamental
physics of some kind--they

00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:08.389
explain to me why Einstein was
wrong.

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.150
And indeed, why all science
known to date is wrong,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.084
and they are right.
And then, they say,

00:03:15.084 --> 00:03:19.076
you know, nobody believed
Einstein either--as if that was

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:22.069
somehow meant to make you
believe them.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.840
They tend to write these things
all in capital letters.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.819
There's a kind of pathology.
When they used to write--when

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.488
they used to do it on pencil and
paper, they would write in such

00:03:32.488 --> 00:03:35.750
a way that you--they covered
every inch of the paper.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.166
And, you know,
they'd write something,

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.310
then they'd write around the
margins, back to the top.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.789
There's some psychological
thing--I don't know what it is.

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:47.500
But the legend of Einstein
prompts a whole bunch of people

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.310
to think that they too might be
patent clerks.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.615
Yes?
Student: How do people

00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:55.651
find you?
Professor Charles

00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:56.550
Bailyn: Oh,
well, look.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.790
You can look up the astronomy
department website of Harvard,

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.426
Yale and Princeton,
and you'll find a whole bunch

00:04:02.426 --> 00:04:05.833
of people, I suppose.
I also have published papers on

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:09.770
black holes, and things that
made their way into the media.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.576
I've actually had a fall-off on
this, because I haven't been,

00:04:12.576 --> 00:04:15.383
you know, quoted opining about
black holes in The New York

00:04:15.383 --> 00:04:19.040
Times recently.
But ten years ago that--well

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.449
I'll explain that in a couple
weeks.

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.319
There was an interesting thing
that happened.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.524
In any case,
you know, if you want to

00:04:27.524 --> 00:04:30.769
publicize your theory,
what you do is you find a bunch

00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:34.320
of fairly prominent people in
the field and you send them a

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.672
big screen saying,
you know, you will regret it if

00:04:38.672 --> 00:04:42.589
you do not appreciate my genius.
Student: Do you ever

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:43.440
read it?
Do you read them?

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.790
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Sometimes I do.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.671
We have a little file in the
library called the Crank File,

00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:49.560
in the Astronomy Department
library.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.049
And from time to time,
you know, we assign graduate

00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:56.050
students to figure out why
they're wrong.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.229
We haven't done that lately.
Sometimes people amuse

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.184
themselves by answering them.
This can get you into various

00:05:04.184 --> 00:05:06.912
kinds of trouble.
There was the gentleman with

00:05:06.912 --> 00:05:10.667
the theory of the Universe,
which he illustrated in colored

00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:13.500
pencils,
while he was serving his time

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.449
at a medium security institution
in Washington State.

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.385
And we thought,
you know, what a great way

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:21.414
to--you know,
much better way to be spending

00:05:21.414 --> 00:05:24.529
your time in prison than some
other things you could think of.

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:26.449
So, we sent him a bunch of
textbooks and stuff.

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.654
Then we started getting letters
back, saying,

00:05:28.654 --> 00:05:31.610
after I finish my sentence,
I'm coming to study with you,

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.380
and explaining why he was
innocent of the crime of which

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.651
he had been committed.
And so, at a certain point we

00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:40.209
started returning things,
you know.

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:42.819
No, terribly sorry,
this individual has left Yale.

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.149
We don't know where he is,
whoever it was.

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:47.675
This is Jerry Orosz who carried
on this conversation for a

00:05:47.675 --> 00:05:50.059
while.
And so, you have to be a little

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:52.215
bit careful.
And then--oh there was the

00:05:52.215 --> 00:05:54.903
guy--This was amazing.
There was a guy who showed up

00:05:54.903 --> 00:05:57.977
at the start of the semester.
He's dressed in a suit and tie,

00:05:57.977 --> 00:06:00.184
carrying a briefcase,
walks into the department

00:06:00.184 --> 00:06:02.199
office and says,
"Where's my classroom?

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.610
I'm supposed to teach
cosmology."

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.322
And he looked very respectable.
The secretary thought,

00:06:08.322 --> 00:06:10.321
not with us,
you're not, so sent him over to

00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:12.493
the Physics Department.
He asked the same question of

00:06:12.493 --> 00:06:15.057
the Physics Department.
He had just walked in off the

00:06:15.057 --> 00:06:17.860
street with a briefcase full of
his textbook.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.737
And he was very annoyed that we
hadn't assigned him a classroom

00:06:21.737 --> 00:06:24.801
and assigned students to come
and learn, you know,

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.240
his particular theory of
cosmology.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.250
And in the end,
he had to be escorted off the

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.850
premises, and asked never to
return.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.527
So yeah, all kinds of patent
clerks in the world,

00:06:35.527 --> 00:06:37.480
but most of them aren't
Einstein.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.651
That's kind of the moral.
And the reason you can

00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:43.149
tell--you asked whether I read
these things.

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:48.225
It's very easy to tell whether
there's anything that you might

00:06:48.225 --> 00:06:52.059
be useful to read.
Because what these people tend

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:56.252
to say when they are not worth
reading is, they tend to say

00:06:56.252 --> 00:06:59.000
that all previous science is
wrong.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.629
I am revolutionizing things.
Einstein is wrong, they say.

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:07.180
But Einstein didn't say that
Newton was wrong.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.310
That wasn't what happened.
That wasn't how a revolution

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.217
works.
You revolutionize science only

00:07:15.217 --> 00:07:24.120
if the new theory encompasses
what was previously known--the

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.752
previous theories.
And this is this business of

00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:33.623
the parameter,
gamma, where under appropriate

00:07:33.623 --> 00:07:36.350
circumstances,
gamma is one.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.342
And under those circumstances,
you reproduce the theory that

00:07:40.342 --> 00:07:42.170
was already in existence.

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:48.821
And so, you know,
there's been hundreds and

00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:51.871
hundreds of years of Newtonian
physics, all of which is

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:54.129
basically right,
one way or another.

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:58.475
So whatever your new idea is
has to encompass all the things

00:07:58.475 --> 00:08:01.199
that were right about the old
idea.

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:03.709
And so, you don't overturn
Newton.

00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:06.744
What you do is,
you demonstrate that Newton's

00:08:06.744 --> 00:08:09.709
theory is only a part of a
bigger theory.

00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:12.057
And then, the bigger theory is
the new theory and it

00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:14.543
encompasses new kinds of data
and explains new kinds of

00:08:14.543 --> 00:08:16.546
things,
while simultaneously not

00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:20.476
overturning all the things that
you know are right about the old

00:08:20.476 --> 00:08:22.956
theory.
And this is the thing that the

00:08:22.956 --> 00:08:25.802
people who wish they were
Einstein, but aren't,

00:08:25.802 --> 00:08:28.210
don't understand.
And so, anytime you see

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.213
something where you're--where
they're going to revolutionize

00:08:31.213 --> 00:08:33.250
all of science,
it's certainly wrong.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.286
Because there's a large
fraction of science in current

00:08:36.286 --> 00:08:39.629
existence that is correct.
And you have to understand that.

00:08:39.629 --> 00:08:42.434
And you have to encompass it
and go beyond that--but it's not

00:08:42.434 --> 00:08:45.097
going to get overturned.
The planets aren't going to

00:08:45.097 --> 00:08:48.529
stop going in Keplerian orbits
because somebody has a new idea.

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:51.889
And so, it has to encompass the
old idea.

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:55.273
Recently, in conjunction,
in part with Einstein Year,

00:08:55.273 --> 00:08:58.136
two years ago,
the historians of science have

00:08:58.136 --> 00:09:01.389
been rethinking what's going on
with Einstein,

00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:03.570
and what happened in that
patent office.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.610
And there's a new kind of idea
that actually,

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:10.272
it was--it wasn't that he was
working in obscurity and

00:09:10.272 --> 00:09:12.823
some--and,
you know, flipping burgers or

00:09:12.823 --> 00:09:16.264
something--that his work in the
patent office was very important

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.340
to the way he developed his
theory.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.572
And that one of the reasons
Einstein did what he did was he

00:09:21.572 --> 00:09:24.750
was working in a patent office
and not in a university.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.870
Because, what was he doing in
the patent office?

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.906
Well, it turns out that in the
early part of the twentieth

00:09:29.906 --> 00:09:32.889
century, one of the big set of
inventions that was coming

00:09:32.889 --> 00:09:35.340
through were ways of
synchronizing clocks.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.919
It turn--because railroads had
just been invented.

00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:41.554
And until then,
you had had a situation where

00:09:41.554 --> 00:09:45.138
every city had its own time.
Every city had a little

00:09:45.138 --> 00:09:47.434
observatory.
They would figure out when the

00:09:47.434 --> 00:09:49.948
Sun was directly overhead.
They would proclaim that to be

00:09:49.948 --> 00:09:51.620
noon.
They'd fire off a whistle.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.019
Everyone would set all their
clocks.

00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:55.850
But that meant--but they didn't
have time zones.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.656
And that meant that every
little town had a different time

00:09:58.656 --> 00:10:00.780
system.
There was--Boston time was

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.399
different from Hartford time,
was different from New York

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:07.342
time by 22.5 minutes,
or whatever the appropriate

00:10:07.342 --> 00:10:09.875
amount would be.
And that's all fine,

00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:13.269
if you move between these
cities slowly.

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:16.845
If you start running trains,
you've got to have--the train

00:10:16.845 --> 00:10:19.543
system has to have a unified
system of time,

00:10:19.543 --> 00:10:21.990
otherwise they run into each
other.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.799
And there were crashes and
terrible things.

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:27.240
And so, then,
you have to have--okay.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.942
Then you have to have Boston
and New York having the same

00:10:29.942 --> 00:10:31.417
time.
So, how do you synchronize

00:10:31.417 --> 00:10:34.136
those clocks?
Well, you've just invented the

00:10:34.136 --> 00:10:38.349
telegraph, so you send an--you
send an electromagnetic signal

00:10:38.349 --> 00:10:41.789
at the speed of light from
Boston to New York,

00:10:41.789 --> 00:10:44.467
and then back again,
in order to synchronize your

00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:46.167
clocks.
And there were various

00:10:46.167 --> 00:10:49.322
inventions that Einstein was
reviewing in the patent office

00:10:49.322 --> 00:10:51.979
to accomplish this.
And so, in his job,

00:10:51.979 --> 00:10:55.434
in his day job,
he spent all his time thinking

00:10:55.434 --> 00:10:59.504
about clocks and time,
and signals moving at the speed

00:10:59.504 --> 00:11:02.352
of light.
So, perhaps it isn't surprising

00:11:02.352 --> 00:11:05.440
that he had deep insights into
these kinds of things.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.890
So, the current feeling among,
at least, some historians of

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:15.306
science, is that the patent
office was, in fact,

00:11:15.306 --> 00:11:19.156
key to Einstein's thinking.
So, he didn't come out of

00:11:19.156 --> 00:11:21.660
obscurity at all.
He came out of the only place

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.383
where the surroundings were such
that you would have thought

00:11:25.383 --> 00:11:28.455
these thoughts.
This is associated with a

00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:32.789
historian of science named Peter
Galison, among others,

00:11:32.789 --> 00:11:35.370
who wrote a book called
Einstein's Clocks and

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.610
Poincare's Maps to try and
demonstrate how the practical

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.685
work these people were doing
influenced their theoretical

00:11:41.685 --> 00:11:43.090
work.
Yes?

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.840
Student: Was it
triggered by one event?

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.803
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Well no,

00:11:46.803 --> 00:11:49.110
he--was he triggered by one
particular event?

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.035
What prompted him to think
about this was a whole series of

00:11:53.035 --> 00:11:56.690
experiments that had been
carried out--all of which,

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.431
as I mentioned last time,
one way or another,

00:11:59.431 --> 00:12:03.044
demonstrated that this business
that the speed of light was

00:12:03.044 --> 00:12:05.350
constant in all reference
frames.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.595
And that there was no ether
through which was the medium

00:12:09.595 --> 00:12:13.840
that was imagined to exist
through which electromagnetic

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.857
waves were supposed to pass.
And there had been a series of

00:12:17.857 --> 00:12:20.899
experiments to try and detect
slight changes in the speed of

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:23.581
light when you put it on a
rail--when you put it on a

00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:25.691
train, right?
It's all about trains and

00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:27.629
elevators, which had just been
invented.

00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:32.090
And--but it wasn't one
particular triggering event.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.700
There was this whole range of
things.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.466
And Einstein,
it should be said,

00:12:35.466 --> 00:12:37.745
was, by far,
not the only person thinking

00:12:37.745 --> 00:12:39.777
about this.
We call the transformations

00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:42.088
Lorentz transformations,
because there was a guy named

00:12:42.088 --> 00:12:45.086
Lorentz who thought them up.
Mathematicians like Poincare,

00:12:45.086 --> 00:12:47.585
physicists like
Minkowski--there were a whole

00:12:47.585 --> 00:12:49.799
bunch of people thinking about
this,

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:52.120
and it was an urgent problem in
physics.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.470
And so that had to be dealt
with.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.738
And if Einstein hadn't existed,
it might have taken a little

00:12:58.738 --> 00:13:02.340
longer, but we would have gotten
special relativity in the end.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.143
That's not necessarily true of
general relativity,

00:13:05.143 --> 00:13:08.311
as I'll explain in a second.
General relativity--if Einstein

00:13:08.311 --> 00:13:10.324
hadn't existed,
general relativity might not

00:13:10.324 --> 00:13:14.169
have happened until the 1960s,
because it was not prompted by

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:18.263
a range of experimental results.
The other bunch of experimental

00:13:18.263 --> 00:13:21.390
results that were prominent at
the time were the atomic physics

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.710
experiments that lead to quantum
mechanics,

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.360
which Einstein had a hand in,
as well.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.519
Okay, so, now let me move on to
general relativity.

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:34.889
That's a good moment to make
this transition.

00:13:34.889 --> 00:13:39.617
So, general relativity,
known as GR,

00:13:39.617 --> 00:13:45.019
for short, is now a theory of
gravity.

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:49.692
So, the part of Newtonian
physics that is overthrown,

00:13:49.692 --> 00:13:52.477
or encompassed,
as I was saying,

00:13:52.477 --> 00:13:56.970
by special relativity,
are the Laws of Motion.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:01.166
Now, general relativity has the
law--those same laws of motion,

00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:04.549
but also has embedded in it a
theory of gravity,

00:14:04.549 --> 00:14:07.514
which is fundamentally
different from the way Newton

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:12.652
thought about gravity.
So, Newtonian gravity is

00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:18.420
thought of as a force.
It's a particular force.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.896
It's the force of gravity.
There's a little equation,

00:14:20.896 --> 00:14:24.080
the force of gravity is equal
to the gravitational constant,

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.296
G, times the mass of one
object, times the mass of the

00:14:27.296 --> 00:14:29.718
other object,
divided by the distance between

00:14:29.718 --> 00:14:33.347
them squared.
And the odd thing--and this was

00:14:33.347 --> 00:14:38.020
sort of the starting point of
Einstein's thought.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.330
The odd thing is these masses.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.315
And because--remember,
somebody asked me last time,

00:14:50.315 --> 00:14:52.683
what is mass?
And I gave you a whole thing

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:55.804
about the inertial mass.
How much it resists being

00:14:55.804 --> 00:14:58.766
pushed.
And that comes about from

00:14:58.766 --> 00:15:04.543
F = ma. And so,
the kind of mass that I defined

00:15:04.543 --> 00:15:09.934
last time is the inertial
mass--how much it resists being

00:15:09.934 --> 00:15:13.505
pushed.
And so, conceptually--the mass

00:15:13.505 --> 00:15:17.772
that's in Newton's equations of
gravity--conceptually,

00:15:17.772 --> 00:15:20.590
that's a different kind of
mass.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.429
It doesn't have to be the same
number.

00:15:22.429 --> 00:15:27.153
This is gravitational mass,
because it's defined

00:15:27.153 --> 00:15:31.226
differently.
It's defined not by how much an

00:15:31.226 --> 00:15:35.440
object resists being pushed by a
force--any force,

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.083
but by how much the object
creates a particular kind of

00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:41.664
force.
So, in this,

00:15:41.664 --> 00:15:43.409
it's how much it resists
forces.

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.679
In this, it's how much the
force is created.

00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:47.549
And these are conceptually
different things.

00:15:47.549 --> 00:15:53.079
It turns out that to the best
experimental evidence that you

00:15:53.079 --> 00:15:56.360
can muster, which by now is
many,

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.806
many decimal places,
these two kinds of mass are

00:15:59.806 --> 00:16:02.524
exactly the same.
This has an experimental

00:16:02.524 --> 00:16:05.340
consequence that was known
already to Galileo in the

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.899
seventeenth century.
Look what happened.

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:10.518
Supposing M_1
is the Earth,

00:16:10.518 --> 00:16:14.110
and M_2 is
some object that you're dropping

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.540
from a high tower.
So, the story is,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.490
Galileo goes to the top of the
Tower of Pisa.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.227
He drops a cannonball,
or something,

00:16:21.227 --> 00:16:23.379
and watches it fall.
Then what happens?

00:16:23.379 --> 00:16:30.110
You substitute
F_gravity into

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:35.940
the equation of motion.
And what do you get?

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.039
So, you're using a particular
kind of force.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:43.009
So, you get GM of the
object, M of the Earth,

00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:46.723
divided by distance squared,
where the distance is the

00:16:46.723 --> 00:16:48.873
distance between the centers of
the objects--so,

00:16:48.873 --> 00:16:51.617
this is basically the distance
to the center of the Earth--is

00:16:51.617 --> 00:16:54.370
equal to the mass of the object,
times its acceleration.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:59.071
And, look.
If this mass is the same as

00:16:59.071 --> 00:17:03.480
that mass, they cancel.
What does that mean?

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.394
So, you can do this.
It means the motion,

00:17:06.394 --> 00:17:10.970
the acceleration of the object,
doesn't depend on its mass.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.320
The acceleration of the object
will be the same for any object

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.960
because, if it has greater
inertia,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.605
it also generates,
by exactly a proportional

00:17:21.605 --> 00:17:25.824
amount, a greater force.
And so, everything falls from

00:17:25.824 --> 00:17:29.309
the tower at the same rate.
And that's what Galileo did.

00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:31.893
He brought up a cannonball,
and a wooden ball,

00:17:31.893 --> 00:17:34.649
and a whole bunch of other
objects, dropped them,

00:17:34.649 --> 00:17:37.519
and discovered that the Greeks
had been wrong.

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:39.500
The Greeks imagined the heavier
the thing is,

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.033
the fast it falls.
But the only reason you think

00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:44.736
that is because of dropping
things like feathers,

00:17:44.736 --> 00:17:47.440
which do fall kind of slowly
and erratically.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.210
That has nothing to do with
gravity.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.700
That's air pressure, right?
And so, if you drop things that

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.726
are heavy enough so that air
pressure isn't important,

00:17:55.726 --> 00:17:59.293
they fall at the same rate.
So, that is the experiment that

00:17:59.293 --> 00:18:02.940
proves that gravitational mass
is the same as inertial mass.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.990
All other forces don't have
this consequence.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.944
There is, for example--well,
let me not draw on the corner

00:18:10.944 --> 00:18:13.039
here.
I'll be just like the cranks.

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:16.909
You know, I'll start drawing
all the way around the edge of

00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:19.270
the thing, here.
So, let us go on.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.672
Let's see.
There is, for example,

00:18:23.672 --> 00:18:28.195
electrical force,
which has a very similar kind

00:18:28.195 --> 00:18:31.175
of equation.
That's a constant,

00:18:31.175 --> 00:18:36.026
times the charge of one object,
times the charge of another

00:18:36.026 --> 00:18:40.710
object, divided by the distance
between them squared.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:44.557
That looks almost identical to
what the gravitational force

00:18:44.557 --> 00:18:47.497
looks like.
But, because the charge of an

00:18:47.497 --> 00:18:51.508
object isn't equal to its mass,
different objects respond

00:18:51.508 --> 00:18:55.305
differently to--when put
in--when an electric force is

00:18:55.305 --> 00:18:58.359
exerted on them.
If you compare a proton,

00:18:58.359 --> 00:19:01.652
which is a mass of subatomic
particle of charge one,

00:19:01.652 --> 00:19:04.686
with a positron,
which is a low-mass particle of

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:07.400
charge one.
And you put the same amount of

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.697
force on them,
the positron will move much

00:19:09.697 --> 00:19:12.049
more, because it has so much
less mass.

00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:16.047
And so, different objects
respond in different ways to all

00:19:16.047 --> 00:19:21.847
forces except gravity.
So, the unusual thing about

00:19:21.847 --> 00:19:30.997
gravity--so, gravity is weird,
because the gravitational mass

00:19:30.997 --> 00:19:37.507
turns out to be exactly equal,
at least, to the best possible

00:19:37.507 --> 00:19:39.279
measurements,
to the inertial mass.

00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:44.979
And there's no excuse within
Newtonian theory to explain why

00:19:44.979 --> 00:19:48.167
that might be,
and why all objects

00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:53.266
move--therefore,
move the same when put in a

00:19:53.266 --> 00:19:58.609
gravitational field.
Okay, so, this bugged Einstein.

00:19:58.609 --> 00:20:01.299
This is the kind of thing that
bothered him.

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:06.649
And so, to explain this and
other related,

00:20:06.649 --> 00:20:13.564
sort of conceptual issues,
he promulgated a completely

00:20:13.564 --> 00:20:23.740
different theory--namely--so.
Einstein says--okay.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.445
So, gravity,
Einstein says,

00:20:25.445 --> 00:20:31.219
is not a force.
That's not the right way to

00:20:31.219 --> 00:20:36.292
think about it.
And so, what--how does this

00:20:36.292 --> 00:20:38.900
work, then?
All right, so point one.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:44.416
Objects move in a straight
line, when they are not in a

00:20:44.416 --> 00:20:48.810
straight line,
in the absence of a force.

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:55.750
This is Newton's first law,
or something.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.045
If you're moving at a constant
velocity, you will continue

00:20:59.045 --> 00:21:01.763
moving in the same direction,
at the same speed,

00:21:01.763 --> 00:21:05.630
unless something happens;
like, a force is applied to you.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.859
If gravity isn't a force,
that should still be true.

00:21:08.859 --> 00:21:11.546
Objects are moving in straight
lines all the time,

00:21:11.546 --> 00:21:14.233
whether there's a
gravita--whether there's gravity

00:21:14.233 --> 00:21:16.310
around or not.
That seems very odd,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.636
because we know perfectly well
that things--that when you have

00:21:19.636 --> 00:21:22.016
a gravitational force,
and you're in an orbit,

00:21:22.016 --> 00:21:24.579
you go around in a circle,
not in a straight line at all.

00:21:24.579 --> 00:21:27.769
So, how does Einstein reconcile
this with reality?

00:21:27.769 --> 00:21:30.559
And that's part two of the
theory.

00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:39.569
Part two of the theory is that
the presence of mass--inertial

00:21:39.569 --> 00:21:48.730
mass, now--creates curvature in
space-time, space and time.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:53.915
Now, how does that help?
That helps because you have to

00:21:53.915 --> 00:21:57.422
then go back and think:
what do you mean by going in a

00:21:57.422 --> 00:22:00.400
straight line if you're in a
curved space?

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.225
I'll give you some examples of
this that you can see in a

00:22:03.225 --> 00:22:05.952
minute.
What you mean by a straight

00:22:05.952 --> 00:22:10.160
line is the shortest distance
between two points.

00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:17.656
Now, we know from
experience--or many of us know

00:22:17.656 --> 00:22:21.612
from experience--that on a
curved spaced the shortest

00:22:21.612 --> 00:22:26.026
difference between two points is
not exactly what you would

00:22:26.026 --> 00:22:30.455
expect it to be.
Has anyone flown on an airplane

00:22:30.455 --> 00:22:33.300
from here to Asia,
for example?

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.989
Fly from New York to Beijing.
So, let's make a map,

00:22:38.989 --> 00:22:43.050
a flat map.
So, here's a flat space--north,

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.240
east, west, south.
Here's New York.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.177
Here's Beijing.
And you might imagine,

00:22:49.177 --> 00:22:52.022
if things were flat,
that the way you would get--and

00:22:52.022 --> 00:22:55.089
the quickest way that the
airlines would save money,

00:22:55.089 --> 00:22:57.837
you know, because they
don't--is that they would fly

00:22:57.837 --> 00:23:00.035
directly east.
Because it's more or less at

00:23:00.035 --> 00:23:01.990
the same latitude,
New York and Beijing.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.970
But that isn't what happens.
That isn't what happens at all.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.154
What you do,
if you fly that route,

00:23:08.154 --> 00:23:13.400
or if you go the other way to
Europe, wherever it is that

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.960
you're going is,
you fly this way.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.065
You go way up north.
You look down halfway through,

00:23:21.065 --> 00:23:23.930
there's the Artic.
Why do you do that?

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.060
It's because the Earth isn't
flat.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.256
The Earth is a sphere.
And so, what it really looks

00:23:29.256 --> 00:23:34.360
like is this.
Here's the Earth.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.486
Here's New York.
Here's Beijing,

00:23:37.486 --> 00:23:40.740
and you fly this way,
because that's the shortest

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.723
distance across a--the surface
of the sphere,

00:23:43.723 --> 00:23:48.079
between two points.
I have a sphere somewhere.

00:23:48.079 --> 00:23:53.589
Let's see, here's a sphere
[holds up a basketball].

00:23:53.589 --> 00:24:00.660
And this line here--think of
this as the equator.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.271
And if you go from here to
here, it would be the shortest

00:24:03.271 --> 00:24:05.697
distance between the two
points--would be to go right

00:24:05.697 --> 00:24:07.824
across the equator.
But we're not going on the

00:24:07.824 --> 00:24:08.960
equator.
We're in the northern

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.684
hemisphere.
So now, I'm going to tip this

00:24:10.684 --> 00:24:13.119
upward so that these two things
are both in the northern

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:16.036
hemisphere.
And now this line goes up and

00:24:16.036 --> 00:24:18.920
across.
And if I tip it all the way up,

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.205
so that you would be dealing
with two cities on the opposite

00:24:23.205 --> 00:24:26.069
side of the world,
as New York and Beijing,

00:24:26.069 --> 00:24:28.190
close enough,
it goes--the closest line

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.589
between them doesn't go around
this way,

00:24:30.589 --> 00:24:32.720
it goes straight up over the
top.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.210
So, if you project that onto a
flat map, it looks like this.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.938
But in fact,
on a sphere,

00:24:38.938 --> 00:24:42.971
on the surface of a sphere,
that is the shortest distance

00:24:42.971 --> 00:24:46.862
between those two points.
It's the exact same distance as

00:24:46.862 --> 00:24:49.852
it would be in the equator.
You just tip the thing up,

00:24:49.852 --> 00:24:52.420
and it's clear that this is the
long way around.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:58.591
So, if you have a curved space
and you're trying to get,

00:24:58.591 --> 00:25:02.330
in the shortest way,
from one point to another,

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.431
and you don't know you're on a
curved space,

00:25:04.431 --> 00:25:06.190
you interpret it as a flat
space,

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:11.259
then you will interpret the
path that you take as curved.

00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:15.763
And so, Einstein's statement is
that the presence of mass

00:25:15.763 --> 00:25:18.819
doesn't exert a gravitational
force.

00:25:18.819 --> 00:25:20.380
That's the wrong way to think
about it.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.157
What it does is,
it creates a curvature in the

00:25:23.157 --> 00:25:25.004
space-time.
And so, then,

00:25:25.004 --> 00:25:29.022
objects traveling from one
place to another move in

00:25:29.022 --> 00:25:32.076
straight lines,
defined as the shortest

00:25:32.076 --> 00:25:35.210
distance between those two
points.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.673
But if we're not taking the
curvature into account,

00:25:37.673 --> 00:25:39.890
it looks like it's going around
in circles.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.970
All right.
Tough concept.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.585
So, let's demonstrate this.
The sheet is supposed to

00:25:46.585 --> 00:25:51.400
represent space-time.
Space-time is--and now,

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.620
I've got to explain that,
right?

00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:03.949
So, what is space time?
Because it's space-time that's

00:26:03.949 --> 00:26:07.807
doing the curving.
It's--you can think of it as a

00:26:07.807 --> 00:26:12.279
four-dimensional coordinate
system, where the four

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:17.390
dimensions are the three
familiar spatial dimensions,

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.940
X, Y, Z,
and T for time.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.317
And you can understand where
any given event,

00:26:23.317 --> 00:26:25.478
where an event is something
that happens,

00:26:25.478 --> 00:26:27.640
can be identified with four
numbers.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.085
It's spatial position--that's
three numbers,

00:26:30.085 --> 00:26:32.019
and the time at which it
occurs.

00:26:32.019 --> 00:26:35.567
Now, in order to get these
things into the same units,

00:26:35.567 --> 00:26:39.717
you have to actually represent
this as the speed of light times

00:26:39.717 --> 00:26:42.177
time,
because that--multiplying by

00:26:42.177 --> 00:26:45.759
the speed of light turns time
units into space units,

00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:49.440
because this is miles per hour,
or space per time.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:58.182
So, one year of time is the
equivalent of one light-year of

00:26:58.182 --> 00:27:03.829
distance.
That's how it converts.

00:27:03.829 --> 00:27:07.183
And so, one interesting
thing--and, of course,

00:27:07.183 --> 00:27:10.759
the sheet, there,
was a two-dimensional space,

00:27:10.759 --> 00:27:13.325
and only had X and
Y that could identify any

00:27:13.325 --> 00:27:16.615
point on the sheet.
So, the metaphor is to use two

00:27:16.615 --> 00:27:20.446
spatial dimensions to represent
what is actually a

00:27:20.446 --> 00:27:24.200
four--conceptually,
a four-dimensional space.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.250
That's why it's a metaphor and
not something real.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.582
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:27:29.582 --> 00:27:32.678
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yes,

00:27:32.678 --> 00:27:34.360
yes.
Absolutely correct.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.741
Does gravity bend time, too?
It has an effect on time

00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:41.269
similar to time dilation when
you're going really fast.

00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:43.575
If you get really close to a
black hole, your clocks will

00:27:43.575 --> 00:27:46.850
slow down.
Yeah, yes?

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.251
Student: Why is that?
Professor Charles

00:27:48.251 --> 00:27:49.922
Bailyn: Why is that?
Let me--next time,

00:27:49.922 --> 00:27:52.662
I'll write down the
Schwarzschild metric,

00:27:52.662 --> 00:27:55.470
and I'll try and answer that
question.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:58.277
Let me go on,
here, for a minute,

00:27:58.277 --> 00:28:03.190
and point out an important
thing about this agreement,

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:07.350
here, which is--that means the
Earth, in its motion,

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.042
for example,
in one year--the time

00:28:10.042 --> 00:28:15.400
coordinate moves one light-year,
which is 10^(16) meters.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.909
The space coordinate moves 2π
times the semi-major axis,

00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:26.764
which is 1 Astronomical Unit.
That's 2π times 1.5 times

00:28:26.764 --> 00:28:30.041
10^(11) meters.
That's something like 10^(12)

00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:32.806
meters.
So, the Earth moves 10,000

00:28:32.806 --> 00:28:37.839
times further in time than it
moves in space in a year.

00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:42.886
And that means that the Earth's
motion in space-time is almost

00:28:42.886 --> 00:28:47.850
precisely a straight line,
going straight forward in time.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.009
So, here's time.
Here's, I don't know,

00:28:50.009 --> 00:28:52.838
the X-axis.
And you could imagine that as

00:28:52.838 --> 00:28:54.975
time goes on,
the Earth, you know,

00:28:54.975 --> 00:28:57.826
moves around the Sun.
So its X-axis --so its

00:28:57.826 --> 00:29:00.329
X-coordinate goes back
and back--back and forth.

00:29:00.329 --> 00:29:02.346
Here's the Sun,
which, you know,

00:29:02.346 --> 00:29:05.338
wiggles a little bit,
much less than the Earth,

00:29:05.338 --> 00:29:08.093
as we discussed.
But this picture,

00:29:08.093 --> 00:29:12.284
here, is inaccurate,
because in fact this distance

00:29:12.284 --> 00:29:17.299
here, which is half a year,
is 10,000 times longer than

00:29:17.299 --> 00:29:21.289
this distance here,
which is half an orbit.

00:29:21.289 --> 00:29:24.226
And so--and so,
in fact, the Earth's motion is

00:29:24.226 --> 00:29:27.881
represented by something that's
almost exactly a straight

00:29:27.881 --> 00:29:31.861
line--so much so that I couldn't
possibly draw the wiggle in a

00:29:31.861 --> 00:29:35.618
way that you could see it.
So, here's the Earth going

00:29:35.618 --> 00:29:38.460
forward in time.
And the wiggle is really small.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.605
That's not surprising,
because the gravitational force

00:29:42.605 --> 00:29:46.829
of the Sun is small enough so
that the Earth's orbit is

00:29:46.829 --> 00:29:50.349
correctly described by Newtonian
physics.

00:29:50.349 --> 00:29:55.367
And so, this is one of those
situations where you have a

00:29:55.367 --> 00:30:00.750
Newtonian physics in relatively
low gravitational fields.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.232
And as the gravitational fields
get stronger,

00:30:03.232 --> 00:30:05.319
weird relativistic effects kick
in.

00:30:05.319 --> 00:30:06.740
But that doesn't happen for the
Earth.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:13.873
So there's--the number is this.
Schwarzschild radius divided by

00:30:13.873 --> 00:30:20.839
distance, is the measure of how
relativistic an orbit is.

00:30:20.839 --> 00:30:27.480
And if this number is small,
then you get correct answers

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:33.009
from the Newtonian theory.
And we can work it out.

00:30:33.009 --> 00:30:36.220
The Schwarzschild radius of the
Sun, 3 x 10^(3) meters.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.609
The distance from the Earth to
the Sun, 1.5 x 10^(11) meters.

00:30:40.609 --> 00:30:46.490
That's 2 x 10^(-8) and that's a
small number.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.220
So, Earth works fine in a
Newtonian sense.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.128
Yes?
Student: Is that

00:30:51.128 --> 00:30:53.879
R the radius of the orbit
or the radius of the [inaudible]

00:30:53.879 --> 00:30:56.115
Professor Charles
Bailyn: That is the distance

00:30:56.115 --> 00:30:58.694
of the moving object from the
center of the gravitating thing

00:30:58.694 --> 00:31:00.500
that's making the curvature
happen.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.660
Yeah.
So, yes is the answer.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.950
It's the radius of the orbit.
Yes?

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.920
Student: Was the theory
of general relativity a theory

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.396
that was just promulgated,
or does it actually have

00:31:10.396 --> 00:31:12.529
equations associated with it?
Professor Charles

00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:13.957
Bailyn: Oh yes.
Does it have equations

00:31:13.957 --> 00:31:15.630
associated with it?
You bet.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:19.769
You don't want to see them.
There's a branch of mathematics

00:31:19.769 --> 00:31:23.096
called differential geometry,
because--what happens is,

00:31:23.096 --> 00:31:25.559
this curvature stuff is all
geometry.

00:31:25.559 --> 00:31:29.023
And the problem is that the
further away you get from an

00:31:29.023 --> 00:31:31.480
object, the less the space is
curved.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.271
So, the amount on the sphere,
on the surface of the

00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:36.839
sphere--it's curved the same way
everywhere.

00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:39.782
So, the equations that describe
the curvature are the same at

00:31:39.782 --> 00:31:42.572
any point on a sphere.
But you can imagine something

00:31:42.572 --> 00:31:45.519
that starts out with strong
curvature and tails off.

00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:47.941
And then the amount of
curvature at any given point is

00:31:47.941 --> 00:31:50.936
different from any other point.
So, you have to describe it

00:31:50.936 --> 00:31:54.128
with a differential amount of
curvature, and then integrate

00:31:54.128 --> 00:31:57.168
over the path that things take.
This gets heinous,

00:31:57.168 --> 00:31:59.309
and we're not going to go
there.

00:31:59.309 --> 00:32:02.170
But I will show you,
next time, some specific

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.640
examples of some of these
equations,

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.610
because it'll help explain
things like why space and time

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:10.210
are reversed inside an event
horizon and stuff.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.956
But, you bet,
there's a whole mathematical

00:32:11.956 --> 00:32:13.989
theory.
In fact, Einstein was not the

00:32:13.989 --> 00:32:17.344
world's greatest mathematician
and it took him until 1917 to

00:32:17.344 --> 00:32:20.180
get all this worked out.
He had to go and get himself

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.828
some math tutoring at the
University of Göttingen and--so

00:32:22.828 --> 00:32:25.289
that he could understand the
geometric properties.

00:32:25.289 --> 00:32:28.220
So, yeah, there's a big
mathematical theory behind it.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.341
Yes?
Student: So,

00:32:30.341 --> 00:32:33.980
if gravity is not a force,
how can you use F = ma?

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.612
Professor Charles
Bailyn: F = ma is a

00:32:37.612 --> 00:32:41.817
general equation of motion.
It doesn't have to be the force

00:32:41.817 --> 00:32:44.049
of gravity.
There are many other forces in

00:32:44.049 --> 00:32:45.797
the world.
Student: But when you're

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:47.737
setting F = ma to
GMM or [inaudible]

00:32:47.737 --> 00:32:49.400
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Right,

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.602
so, that's the Newtonian idea,
that you set F = ma

00:32:52.602 --> 00:32:54.890
equal to GMM over
D^(2).

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:59.272
And the thing that prompted
Einstein's thought was the fact

00:32:59.272 --> 00:33:03.579
that the two different kinds of
masses on each side of the

00:33:03.579 --> 00:33:07.881
equation turned out to be equal.
And you can see why this

00:33:07.881 --> 00:33:10.801
explains that.
Because, if what's happening is

00:33:10.801 --> 00:33:13.605
that you curve space,
and then things follow a

00:33:13.605 --> 00:33:16.970
trajectory dictated by the
curvature of that space,

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.130
then it makes perfect sense
that all objects follow the same

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:22.220
trajectory, regardless of their
mass.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.990
Because they're not actually
being forced to move anywhere.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.470
They're just going in straight
lines, and straight lines are

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:30.109
the same no matter what your
mass is.

00:33:30.109 --> 00:33:33.701
And so, that's why this kind of
curvature provides an

00:33:33.701 --> 00:33:37.500
explanation for what,
in the Newtonian approximation,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:43.960
is the equality of the inertial
and the gravitational mass.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.788
How we doing?
Oh, we've got some more time,

00:33:45.788 --> 00:33:46.809
good.
Go ahead.

00:33:46.809 --> 00:33:48.901
Student: Would a clock
really slow down as it moved

00:33:48.901 --> 00:33:50.479
towards the [inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:33:50.479 --> 00:33:52.125
Bailyn: Yeah.
Student: [inaudible]

00:33:52.125 --> 00:33:53.455
would you have a perception of
[inaudible]

00:33:53.455 --> 00:33:54.655
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Well,

00:33:54.655 --> 00:33:55.920
of course, you are a clock,
right?

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.829
You're--no, you wouldn't notice.
But what would happen is this.

00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:02.890
Supposing you're falling into a
black hole, or something.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:07.150
You look at your clock.
You feel your pulse, you know.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:10.369
Your pulse measured by your
clock has not changed.

00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:14.839
But you look back out into the
world that is distant from the

00:34:14.839 --> 00:34:19.159
black hole, and things are
moving really fast out there.

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:21.144
And so, if you had two
synchronized,

00:34:21.144 --> 00:34:23.809
identical clocks at the start
of your voyage,

00:34:23.809 --> 00:34:26.919
and you keep an eye on what's
happening out here,

00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:29.639
you will discover that,
all of a sudden,

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:31.730
it looks like your clock is
moving slow.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:34.635
And, all of a sudden,
you know, people are aging and

00:34:34.635 --> 00:34:36.686
dying back on Earth,
while, you know,

00:34:36.686 --> 00:34:39.250
it's only been a week in your
perception.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.790
And so, turn it around.
You're sitting on Earth

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:45.920
watching your friend fall
through--fall into a black hole.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.039
And it looks like he's slowing
down, and slowing down,

00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:52.630
and slowing down and maybe--and
never really quite gets to the

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.214
event horizon,
even in an infinite amount of

00:34:55.214 --> 00:34:56.683
time.
But the perception of the

00:34:56.683 --> 00:34:59.219
person falling through is that
they just fall through.

00:34:59.219 --> 00:35:01.543
It's just, the whole Universe
is evolved in the time that

00:35:01.543 --> 00:35:04.520
they've done it.
So, it's one of these weird

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.807
things where time turns out--how
fast time passes turns out to be

00:35:09.807 --> 00:35:13.360
a property of who's doing the
measuring.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.706
Very strange concept,
and very counterintuitive to

00:35:16.706 --> 00:35:20.141
the way we live our life.
Because we all think--because

00:35:20.141 --> 00:35:22.940
we live in low gravitational
fields at low speeds,

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.650
we think time is an absolute
thing that ticks onward for

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:32.260
everybody in the same way,
but it turns out it isn't true.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.477
Yes?
And again, I'll show you an

00:35:34.477 --> 00:35:36.720
equation that--actually,
this is much easier to deal

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.699
with in equations than it is
conceptually,

00:35:38.699 --> 00:35:42.800
and I'll show you an equation
next time which may help.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.630
Student: Can you explain
about the names behind the two

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.471
theories of relativity?
I mean, it doesn't seem like

00:35:47.471 --> 00:35:48.736
the general theory is a
generalization of the special

00:35:48.736 --> 00:35:50.115
theory.
Professor Charles

00:35:50.115 --> 00:35:53.410
Bailyn: It actually is,
because it incorporates aspects

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:56.358
of the special theory.
And it's a generalization in

00:35:56.358 --> 00:35:58.269
terms of what's called the
metric.

00:35:58.269 --> 00:36:01.745
The metric is the mathematical
formula that describes the

00:36:01.745 --> 00:36:04.413
curvature.
And the special theory of

00:36:04.413 --> 00:36:08.800
relativity is the special case
where the metric is flat.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.960
And then, the reason general
relativity is a generalization

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:19.119
is because it allows other--many
other kinds of metrics.

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:21.304
Or, at least,
that's one way of thinking

00:36:21.304 --> 00:36:22.590
about it.
Yes sir.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.015
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:36:25.015 --> 00:36:27.699
Bailyn: Yeah well I--too
small for me to draw.

00:36:27.699 --> 00:36:29.457
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:36:29.457 --> 00:36:31.701
Bailyn: The wiggle is from
the motion of the Earth around

00:36:31.701 --> 00:36:34.025
the Sun.
And it's caused by--the mass of

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:37.172
the Sun warps the space--
Student: [Inaudible]

00:36:37.172 --> 00:36:39.411
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah,

00:36:39.411 --> 00:36:41.863
yeah, yeah.
It's just--all I meant in the

00:36:41.863 --> 00:36:44.420
second one--sorry,
I didn't explain this clearly.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:49.197
All I meant in the second one
was that this one is inaccurate

00:36:49.197 --> 00:36:52.750
in terms of scale.
Student: Okay, oh I see.

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.434
Professor Charles
Bailyn: And that the scale,

00:36:55.434 --> 00:36:57.804
the true scale,
is such that this length ought

00:36:57.804 --> 00:36:59.909
to be 10,000 times longer than
that.

00:36:59.909 --> 00:37:02.230
And under those circumstances
you'd never be able to see it.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:06.440
That's all I meant by that.
Yeah?

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.146
Student: What happens to
time when you're caught

00:37:09.146 --> 00:37:11.801
traveling--you mentioned this,
but what happens to time when

00:37:11.801 --> 00:37:13.469
you're traveling close to the
speed of light?

00:37:13.469 --> 00:37:14.630
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Slows down yeah.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:20.859
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:37:20.859 --> 00:37:26.783
Professor Charles
Bailyn: So,

00:37:26.783 --> 00:37:34.159
how does, how does this work?
Right.

00:37:34.159 --> 00:37:38.460
We are, you know--you can
explain the motion of the Earth

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:42.300
in terms of these so-called
space-time diagrams,

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.739
where one--you take the
four-dimensional thing.

00:37:45.739 --> 00:37:47.210
You project it onto two
dimensions.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:50.535
You can write a space-time
diagram for yourself,

00:37:50.535 --> 00:37:54.640
and you can explain all of the
motion and all of the things

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.400
that happen by such a curved
thing.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.420
So, what happens if you jump,
for example?

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.531
In the Newtonian theory,
you jump, you ought to keep

00:38:02.531 --> 00:38:05.399
going straight up,
except that there is a force,

00:38:05.399 --> 00:38:08.519
which pulls you back down.
So, that we understand.

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:12.110
What happens--how is that
explained in general relativity?

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.684
You jump and you go in a
straight line,

00:38:14.684 --> 00:38:18.342
but the straight line is
through a curved space--curved

00:38:18.342 --> 00:38:21.119
because of the presence of the
Earth.

00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:24.659
And so, it turns out that the
straight line looks like this.

00:38:24.659 --> 00:38:29.009
It goes up and comes back down
again, in just the same way that

00:38:29.009 --> 00:38:33.147
the straight line between New
York and Beijing goes over the

00:38:33.147 --> 00:38:36.287
North Pole.
It goes up and comes back down

00:38:36.287 --> 00:38:40.463
again, because space-time is
curved due to the gravity of the

00:38:40.463 --> 00:38:42.965
Earth.
So, something that we perceive

00:38:42.965 --> 00:38:45.278
to be a curved
trajectory--jumping up,

00:38:45.278 --> 00:38:48.780
falling back down--if you
project it into space-time,

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:53.230
is actually the closest
distance between two events.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.699
So, there's two alternative
explanations of these things.

00:38:56.699 --> 00:38:59.449
In the situation where you're
nowhere near a black hole,

00:38:59.449 --> 00:39:01.099
it turns out that,
mathematically,

00:39:01.099 --> 00:39:04.297
they're exactly equivalent.
If they're exactly equivalent,

00:39:04.297 --> 00:39:06.878
it's much easier to calculate
the Newtonian way,

00:39:06.878 --> 00:39:08.909
and much easier to think about
it.

00:39:08.909 --> 00:39:12.276
So, until you get into a
situation where the

00:39:12.276 --> 00:39:16.192
Schwarzschild radius is
comparable to the distances

00:39:16.192 --> 00:39:20.696
involved,
you're way better off thinking

00:39:20.696 --> 00:39:25.810
Newtonian, because we're just
better at it.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.338
Yes?
Student: I understand

00:39:27.338 --> 00:39:30.254
that in order to get units that
you can line up in any way,

00:39:30.254 --> 00:39:32.920
uniquely, you need to multiply
time by a velocity.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:39.656
But I'm a little confused
about--I mean I know that

00:39:39.656 --> 00:39:46.932
c is this really
important number-- Professor

00:39:46.932 --> 00:39:51.705
Charles Bailyn: Yeah.
Student: - but if the

00:39:51.705 --> 00:39:53.560
only reason why the wiggles in
the graph of motion are really

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.889
tiny is because c is so
enormous.

00:39:54.889 --> 00:39:56.004
I mean - Professor Charles
Bailyn: Couldn't you pick

00:39:56.004 --> 00:39:57.309
another velocity?
Student: Right.

00:39:57.309 --> 00:39:58.269
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah.

00:39:58.269 --> 00:39:59.260
Student: What makes that
an accurate scaling?

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.405
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay,

00:40:00.405 --> 00:40:01.860
so, the reason that's an
accurate scaling is,

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.245
one of the things that comes
out of the theory of relativity

00:40:04.245 --> 00:40:10.460
is that there is a natural unit.
There's a natural set of units.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.044
And the natural set of units
are the units in which these

00:40:12.044 --> 00:40:14.566
crucial constants,
of which c is one and

00:40:14.566 --> 00:40:17.641
G is another,
and H--the Planck

00:40:17.641 --> 00:40:19.957
constant,
which governs quantum

00:40:19.957 --> 00:40:24.460
mechanics, are all equal to one.
And that turns--those are

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:28.123
called Planck units,
and they have--and the

00:40:28.123 --> 00:40:32.309
conversion between different
kinds of energy,

00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:34.772
mass to energy,
things like that,

00:40:34.772 --> 00:40:39.389
all work out as equalities in
the particular set of units,

00:40:39.389 --> 00:40:42.150
where all those constants come
out to be one.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:47.438
So, there is a reason why that
particular velocity is chosen,

00:40:47.438 --> 00:40:51.171
and it's not surprising,
if you had to pick a velocity,

00:40:51.171 --> 00:40:53.429
that you would end up with the
speed of light,

00:40:53.429 --> 00:40:55.400
which has this sort of profound
importance.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.533
Okay, we'll continue next time.

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.446
Professor Christine
Hayes: An interesting

00:00:03.446 --> 00:00:07.101
counterpoint to the apocalyptic
literature and the apocalyptic

00:00:07.101 --> 00:00:10.756
reliance on God's cataclysmic
consummation of history in order

00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:13.813
to dole out justice to the
righteous and the wicked,

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.150
is found in the Book of Esther.
 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.240
And this is a short novella.
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.166
It's set in fifth-century
Persia, it was probably written

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.236
in the fourth century,
we think, but it's set during

00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:27.368
the reign of Xerxes (and there's
no x in the Hebrew

00:00:27.368 --> 00:00:30.700
alphabet--this is Ahasuerus,
which is Xerxes),

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.281
and he was a fifth-century
Persian emperor from about 486

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:37.846
to 465.
It's another heroic fiction

00:00:37.846 --> 00:00:41.081
that features a Jew in the court
of a gentile king,

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:42.570
so it's like Daniel.
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.821
The Jews of Persia are
threatened with genocide,

00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:49.764
and they are saved not by
divine intervention but entirely

00:00:49.764 --> 00:00:51.840
through their own efforts.
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.410
Indeed, the Book of Esther does
not mention God once.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.230
The story revolves around
Mordechai.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.109
Now, Mordechai is a pious Jew.
 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.483
He sits at the gate of the
Persian king,

00:01:02.483 --> 00:01:05.587
Ahasuerus or Xerxes,
and his beautiful niece is also

00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:08.751
central to the story of
course--that's Esther--and he

00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:10.760
has adopted her as his own.
 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.010
There's a lot of comic irony in
this story.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.599
It really is a fun read.
 

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:17.995
Time is not going to permit me
to go into the various subplots

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:21.354
and the dramatic reversals,
the ironies and twists,

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:26.055
but I will just highlight a few
of the most salient points that

00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:30.150
are relevant to the conversation
we've been having.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.046
When the Persian king divorces
his wife, Vashti,

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:36.682
because she refuses to appear
in the royal diadem before his

00:01:36.682 --> 00:01:39.764
male courtiers--presumably in
nothing but the royal

00:01:39.764 --> 00:01:43.524
diadem--Esther's great beauty
commends her to the king and she

00:01:43.524 --> 00:01:46.185
becomes queen.
Now, her uncle Mordechai

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:49.665
advises her to be discreet about
her Jewish identity for safety's

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:53.170
sake.
In 2:10 and 11 it says,

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.103
Esther did not reveal her
people or her kindred,

00:01:56.103 --> 00:01:58.650
for Mordechai had told her not
to reveal it.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.380
Every single day Mordechai
would walk about in front of the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.687
court of the harem,
to learn how Esther was faring

00:02:03.687 --> 00:02:05.569
and what was happening to
her.

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.258
So, a little while later the
king promotes a certain Haman,

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:11.675
Haman the Agagite,
to the post of chief

00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:14.778
administrator.
And everyone in the palace gate

00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:18.633
kneels down to Haman as the king
has ordered, everyone that is

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:20.150
except for Mordechai.
 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.275
Day after day he refuses,
and finally the matter is told

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:25.071
to Haman.
This is chapter 3:4-6,

00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:28.107
and "When they spoke to him day
after day and he would not

00:02:28.107 --> 00:02:30.498
listen to them,"
speaking to Mordechai and he

00:02:30.498 --> 00:02:32.754
won't listen to them,
…they told Haman,

00:02:32.754 --> 00:02:34.914
in order to see whether
Mordechai's resolve would

00:02:34.914 --> 00:02:37.018
prevail;
for he had explained to them

00:02:37.018 --> 00:02:38.110
that he was a Jew.
 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.495
When Haman saw that Mordechai
would not kneel or bow low to

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:43.479
him, Haman was filled with rage.
 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:47.120
But he disdained to lay hands
on Mordechai alone;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.502
having been told who
Mordechai's people were,

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.940
Haman plotted to do away with
all the Jews,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.572
Mordechai's people,
throughout the kingdom of

00:02:54.572 --> 00:02:58.110
Ahasuerus.
So Haman casts lots.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.400
The word for lots is
purim;

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.924
so he casts lots in order to
determine the date of the

00:03:04.924 --> 00:03:10.216
massacre and then he offers the
king a handsome bribe in return

00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:14.569
for permission to kill the Jews
of the kingdom.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.199
This is chapter 3:8-11--and
listen to the rationale that's

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:20.159
proposed.
He says to the king:

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.228
…"There is a certain
people, scattered and dispersed

00:03:23.228 --> 00:03:26.400
among the other peoples in all
the provinces of your realm,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.375
whose laws are different from
those of any other people and

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:32.803
who do not obey the king's laws;
and it is not in Your majesty's

00:03:32.803 --> 00:03:34.270
interest to tolerate them.
 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.298
If it please Your Majesty,
let an edict be drawn for their

00:03:37.298 --> 00:03:40.486
destruction, and I will pay ten
thousand talents of silver to

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:43.250
the stewards for deposit in the
royal treasury."

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.477
Thereupon the king removed his
signet ring from his hand and

00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:48.774
gave it to Haman,
the son of Hammedatha the

00:03:48.774 --> 00:03:50.580
Agagite, the foe of the Jews.
 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.207
And the king said,
"The money and the people are

00:03:53.207 --> 00:03:55.500
yours to do with as you see
fit."

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.030
So he provides a rationale.
 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.259
He also provides a good bribe
along with it to get this edict.

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.387
So this edict goes out to every
province to destroy,

00:04:03.387 --> 00:04:06.637
massacre, and exterminate all
the Jews, young and old,

00:04:06.637 --> 00:04:09.090
children and women,
on a single day.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.020
This is to be the thirteenth of
the month of Adar.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.969
Jews everywhere begin to fast
and weep and wail.

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:17.730
They mourn, they wear sackcloth
and ashes.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.820
And Esther sends to Mordechai
for an explanation of the

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.117
commotion.
She's somewhat sealed off here

00:04:24.117 --> 00:04:26.569
in the harem and doesn't quite
know what's going on.

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.389
So he sends a message informing
her of the decree.

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.346
And he urges her to appeal to
the king and to plead for her

00:04:34.346 --> 00:04:36.396
people.
And Esther hesitates,

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:40.225
partly because to appear
unbidden before the king carries

00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:41.730
a penalty of death.
 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.140
And Mordechai responds with
this message.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.948
This is Esther 4:13b to 16:
"Do not imagine that you,

00:04:48.948 --> 00:04:51.703
of all the Jews,
will escape with your life by

00:04:51.703 --> 00:04:53.540
being in the king's palace.
 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.789
On the contrary,
if you keep silent in this

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.788
crisis, relief and deliverance
will come to the Jews from

00:04:58.788 --> 00:05:01.151
another quarter,
while you and your father's

00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:02.060
house will perish.
 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.190
And who knows,
perhaps you have attained to

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.269
royal position for just such a
crisis."

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:08.896
Then Esther sent back this
answer to Mordechai:

00:05:08.896 --> 00:05:12.150
"Go, assemble all the Jews who
live in Shushan," [in Susa,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.319
in Persia]
"and fast in my behalf;

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.269
do not eat or drink for three
days, night or day.

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:19.889
I and my maidens will observe
the same fast.

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.721
Then I shall go to the king,
though it is contrary to the

00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:25.350
law, and if I am to perish,
I shall perish!"

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.461
So Mordechai went about the
city and did just as Esther had

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.863
commanded him.
It's a very tense scene,

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:34.142
Esther approaches the king and
he--you get a signal:

00:05:34.142 --> 00:05:38.026
he raises his scepter or not,
to accept you or not--and in

00:05:38.026 --> 00:05:42.201
this tense moment he permits her
entry and he offers to grant her

00:05:42.201 --> 00:05:45.209
every request.
And so she asks that the king

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:48.420
and Haman attend a banquet that
she's preparing.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.511
And at Esther's banquet,
the king offers to grant Esther

00:05:53.511 --> 00:05:57.399
any request that she might wish
to make.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.207
And so her request is stated in
the following terms,

00:06:00.207 --> 00:06:02.630
terms that show her loyalty to
her people.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.825
Esther 7:3b-6:
…"If Your Majesty will

00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:10.904
do me the favor,
and if it pleases Your Majesty,

00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:14.508
let my life be granted me as my
wish and my people as my

00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:16.519
request.
For we have been sold,

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:18.206
my people and I,
to be destroyed,

00:06:18.206 --> 00:06:19.839
massacred, and exterminated.
 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.847
Had we only been sold as
bondmen and bondwomen," [as

00:06:22.847 --> 00:06:24.970
slaves]
"I would have kept silent;

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.639
for the adversary is not worth
the king's trouble."

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.310
Thereupon King Ahasuerus
demanded of Queen Esther,

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.089
"Who is he and where is he who
dared to do this?"

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:35.569
"The adversary and enemy,"
replied Esther,

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:36.959
"is this evil Haman!"
 

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:39.288
And Haman cringed in terror
before the king and the

00:06:39.288 --> 00:06:42.028
queen.
So Esther boldly reveals her

00:06:42.028 --> 00:06:44.490
Jewish identity before the king.
 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.855
She expresses her solidarity in
her speech with phrases like

00:06:47.855 --> 00:06:49.509
"we" and "my people and I."
 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.180
There's a real comedy of errors
that follows.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.888
The king leaves the room in a
rage and Haman falls prostrate

00:06:56.888 --> 00:07:00.079
on Esther's couch to beg for his
life.

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:02.910
So when the king reenters the
room, he sees Haman in this

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.639
compromising position and he
declares, "Does he mean to

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:07.610
ravish the queen in my own
palace?"

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.613
So he orders Haman to be
impaled on the very stake that

00:07:11.613 --> 00:07:15.927
Haman had set up for Mordechai,
and Mordechai in fact is then

00:07:15.927 --> 00:07:18.759
elevated in Haman's stead within
the court.

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:21.738
But the Jews are still in
danger because an edict of the

00:07:21.738 --> 00:07:23.199
king's cannot be revoked.
 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.730
Once a word has gone forth from
the king, it is law.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.110
So the solution is a second
edict in which Ahasuerus charges

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.079
the Jews to arm and defend
themselves.

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:37.050
And so then we have another of
many reversals in this story.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.021
What was to be a day of defeat
and massacre of the Jews becomes

00:07:40.021 --> 00:07:42.801
a day of triumph as the Jews who
now have permission to arm

00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:46.373
themselves and fight,
slay those who were bent on

00:07:46.373 --> 00:07:49.634
murdering them.
The victory celebration which

00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:53.152
is the festival of Purim is
commemorated by Jews to this

00:07:53.152 --> 00:07:55.799
day.
The very melodramatic story of

00:07:55.799 --> 00:07:59.977
this luxurious Persian court
life and all of the attendant

00:07:59.977 --> 00:08:03.569
political intrigue that goes on
in this story,

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:07.006
it's recreated in annual
Purim celebrations,

00:08:07.006 --> 00:08:10.100
very raucous,
carnival-like dramatizations.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.997
According to the Talmud on
Purim, it's a mitzvah,

00:08:12.997 --> 00:08:15.420
which can mean a commandment or
a good deed,

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.117
to get so drunk that you can't
distinguish between Mordechai

00:08:19.117 --> 00:08:21.669
and Haman.
But for all of that there are

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:25.019
some very important and striking
themes in the story.

00:08:25.019 --> 00:08:28.280
First, there's the ethnic
element of Jewish identity,

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.478
rather than religious,
that comes to the fore in the

00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:34.305
book of Esther.
The presentation is secular,

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:37.049
the Jews are described as a
people, an ethnos.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.549
Esther is fully assimilated to
her gentile environment.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.603
Unlike Daniel,
who prays towards Jerusalem

00:08:42.603 --> 00:08:45.707
daily in the court of the king
and observes the dietary laws in

00:08:45.707 --> 00:08:49.038
the court of the king,
we hear nothing like this about

00:08:49.038 --> 00:08:51.901
Esther at all.
There's also a very human and

00:08:51.901 --> 00:08:54.820
very anti-apocalyptic message in
this story.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.545
It gives expression to the
conviction that solidarity and

00:08:58.545 --> 00:09:02.404
heroic resistance are necessary
in the face of overwhelming

00:09:02.404 --> 00:09:05.929
anti-Jewish aggression to ensure
Jewish survival.

00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:09.479
This, according to the book of
Esther, so different from the

00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:12.005
book of Daniel,
is the lesson to be learned

00:09:12.005 --> 00:09:13.570
from Israel's history.
 

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.493
If the book of Esther presents
one alternative to the

00:09:17.493 --> 00:09:21.568
post-exilic eschatologies in
which Yahweh's enemies are

00:09:21.568 --> 00:09:25.190
afflicted and consumed for their
wickedness,

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:30.019
then the book of Jonah offers
another perspective.

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:33.504
The book of Jonah is actually
found among the section of the

00:09:33.504 --> 00:09:36.340
Bible called the Prophets--the
second section,

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.693
the prophetic books of the
Bible--and that's because in the

00:09:40.693 --> 00:09:43.019
book of Kings,
2 Kings 14:25,

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:47.180
we have someone identified as
Jonah, the son of Amittai,

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.652
the prophet.
This is considered the same

00:09:49.652 --> 00:09:52.635
Jonah, and so the book is
considered to be among the books

00:09:52.635 --> 00:09:55.396
of the Prophets.
But it differs in significant

00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:57.649
ways from the other prophetic
books.

00:09:57.649 --> 00:09:59.740
It is not, in fact,
a collection of oracles.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.995
It's actually a story,
a somewhat comic story,

00:10:02.995 --> 00:10:06.830
a comic tale about a reluctant
prophet named Jonah.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.391
The second interesting or
unusual thing about this book,

00:10:10.391 --> 00:10:14.276
is that Jonah is commissioned
by Yahweh to carry a message to

00:10:14.276 --> 00:10:18.021
the people of Nineveh,
the capital of Assyria,

00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:20.620
not to the people of Israel.
 

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.682
The Israelite concept of divine
mercy receives its full

00:10:25.682 --> 00:10:28.870
expression in the book of Jonah.
 

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.793
In the first chapter,
Jonah receives a call from

00:10:31.793 --> 00:10:35.587
Yahweh who instructs him to go
to Nineveh, whose wickedness is

00:10:35.587 --> 00:10:38.200
great, and to proclaim God's
judgment.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.636
Chapter 1, the first three
verses: "The word of the Lord

00:10:41.636 --> 00:10:45.009
came to Jonah son of Amittai:
Go at once to Nineveh,

00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:47.620
that great city,
and proclaim judgment upon it;

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.889
for their wickedness has come
before Me.

00:10:49.889 --> 00:10:51.975
Jonah, however,
started out to flee to Tarshish

00:10:51.975 --> 00:10:53.200
from the Lord's service."
 

00:10:53.200 --> 00:11:04.809
 
 

00:11:04.809 --> 00:11:14.820
"…He went down to Joppa and
found a ship going to Tarshish.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.517
He paid the fare and went
aboard to sail with the others

00:11:17.517 --> 00:11:19.970
to Tarshish, away from the
service of the Lord."

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.394
So he does this immediate
about-face in a very comic touch

00:11:23.394 --> 00:11:26.038
and sets sail for Spain,
the other end of the

00:11:26.038 --> 00:11:28.051
Mediterranean.
But of course,

00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:31.775
Jonah cannot escape from God,
and God sends a storm which

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:33.970
threatens to destroy the ship.
 

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.893
The non-Israelite sailors on
board pray to their gods and

00:11:37.893 --> 00:11:41.887
then finally they cast lots in
order to discover who it is

00:11:41.887 --> 00:11:44.830
who's brought this danger to the
ship.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.730
And the lot falls to Jonah.
 

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.822
So Jonah confesses that he's a
Hebrew who worships the Lord

00:11:50.822 --> 00:11:54.350
who, as he now realizes,
made both land and sea.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.365
And that is a fact that strikes
great terror in the heart of the

00:11:57.365 --> 00:11:59.950
sailors when they hear this,
that his God is Yahweh.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.950
Jonah further adds that he's
trying to flee from God's

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.781
service and the clear
implication is that he is the

00:12:05.781 --> 00:12:07.649
cause of this terrible storm.
 

00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:11.774
So Jonah proposes that he be
thrown overboard to save the

00:12:11.774 --> 00:12:14.513
ship.
The sailors strive mightily to

00:12:14.513 --> 00:12:18.663
battle the storm but finally in
despair they pray to God,

00:12:18.663 --> 00:12:22.740
Yahweh, to forgive them for
killing an innocent man.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.250
And they heave Jonah overboard
and save the ship.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.770
Now, the sailors are said by
the narrator to revere God.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.340
They offer a sacrifice to him.
 

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.931
They make vows.
In the meantime,

00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:40.044
God has appointed a huge fish
to swallow Jonah and so preserve

00:12:40.044 --> 00:12:43.044
his life.
And from the belly of this

00:12:43.044 --> 00:12:45.039
fish, Jonah prays to God.
 

00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:49.289
The prayer or the psalm is not
entirely appropriate to the

00:12:49.289 --> 00:12:50.779
narrative context.
 

00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:54.750
It's probably an insertion in
the story by a later writer.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.332
It's an insertion that was
probably suggested by references

00:12:58.332 --> 00:13:01.049
within the prayer to drowning in
the deep,

00:13:01.049 --> 00:13:04.683
to crying out to God from the
"belly" of Sheol--and Jonah is

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:08.163
in the "belly" of the fish,
so that linguistic resonance

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:11.732
may very well have been what
prompted someone to insert this

00:13:11.732 --> 00:13:13.432
prayer here.
In any event,

00:13:13.432 --> 00:13:16.904
in response to Jonah's prayer,
God orders the fish to spew

00:13:16.904 --> 00:13:18.549
Jonah out onto dry land.
 

00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:21.570
In chapter 3,
Jonah gets his second chance.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.466
God calls him again and in
contrast to his first response,

00:13:25.466 --> 00:13:28.679
this time Jonah sets out for
Nineveh at once.

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:32.527
And he proclaims God's message:
"In forty days Nineveh will be

00:13:32.527 --> 00:13:35.184
overthrown."
And then comes the shocking

00:13:35.184 --> 00:13:36.630
element in the story.
 

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.240
Chapter 3:5-10:
The people of Nineveh

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.719
believed God.
They proclaimed a fast,

00:13:43.719 --> 00:13:46.340
and great and small alike put
on sackcloth.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.529
And when the news reached the
king of Nineveh,

00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:50.572
he rose from his throne,
took off his robe,

00:13:50.572 --> 00:13:52.470
put on sackcloth,
and sat in ashes.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.784
And he had the word cried
through Nineveh:

00:13:54.784 --> 00:13:58.002
"By decree of the king and his
nobles: No man or beast--of

00:13:58.002 --> 00:14:00.259
flock or herd--shall taste
anything!

00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:02.809
They shall not graze,
and they shall not drink water!

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:05.447
They shall be covered with
sackcloth--man and beast--and

00:14:05.447 --> 00:14:06.789
shall cry mightily to God.
 

00:14:06.789 --> 00:14:10.149
Let everyone turn back from his
evil ways and from the injustice

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:11.429
of which he is guilty.
 

00:14:11.429 --> 00:14:14.070
Who knows but that God may turn
and relent?

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.694
He may turn back from his
wrath, so that we do not

00:14:16.694 --> 00:14:18.460
perish."
God saw what they did,

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.200
how they were turning back from
their evil ways.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.961
And God renounced the
punishment He had planned to

00:14:23.961 --> 00:14:26.779
bring upon them,
and did not carry it out.

00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:31.063
So idolatrous Nineveh believes
God and humbles itself before

00:14:31.063 --> 00:14:33.460
God hoping to arouse his mercy.
 

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.922
And in another humorous touch,
we read that even the animals

00:14:36.922 --> 00:14:40.620
are wearing sackcloth--they're
fasting and crying out to God.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.697
So from the greatest to the
very least, the inhabitants of

00:14:43.697 --> 00:14:46.882
Nineveh turn back from their
evil ways and God's mercy is in

00:14:46.882 --> 00:14:49.635
fact aroused.
The Assyrians are spared,

00:14:49.635 --> 00:14:51.250
and Jonah is furious.
 

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:55.240
Chapter 4:1-4:
This displeased Jonah

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.830
greatly, and he was grieved.
 

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.769
He prayed to the Lord,
saying, "O Lord!

00:14:58.769 --> 00:15:01.302
Isn't this just what I said
when I was still in my own

00:15:01.302 --> 00:15:03.796
country?
That is why I fled beforehand

00:15:03.796 --> 00:15:06.045
to Tarshish.
For I know that You are a

00:15:06.045 --> 00:15:08.466
compassionate and gracious God,
slow to anger,

00:15:08.466 --> 00:15:11.049
abounding in kindness,
renouncing punishment.

00:15:11.049 --> 00:15:12.303
Please, Lord,
take my life,

00:15:12.303 --> 00:15:14.039
for I would rather die than
live."

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:16.520
The Lord replied,
"Are you that deeply

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.390
grieved?"
Jonah doesn't respond;

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.059
he just leaves the city to sulk.
 

00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:24.460
And his complaint seems to be
twofold.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.215
If you're going to punish the
wicked then just punish them.

00:15:27.215 --> 00:15:29.941
They deserve it.
And if you're planning to spare

00:15:29.941 --> 00:15:33.201
them, then just spare them and
don't waste my time with

00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:34.649
messages and oracles.
 

00:15:34.649 --> 00:15:37.848
But the stronger problem for
Jonah seems to be the lack of

00:15:37.848 --> 00:15:39.419
punishment for the wicked.
 

00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:42.207
Jonah is indignant that the
Assyrians didn't get what they

00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:44.799
so richly deserved:
didn't I say this would happen?

00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:47.375
You always forgive,
you're this slow-to-anger,

00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:48.519
compassionate guy!
 

00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:51.019
You always repent,
the wicked are never punished!

00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:53.129
I'm fed up with the way you do
things, God.

00:15:53.129 --> 00:15:55.769
Your mercy perverts your
justice.

00:15:55.769 --> 00:15:57.860
And some things ought not to be
forgiven.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.600
People must be held to account
for their evil actions.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.490
How can God not do justice?
 

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.816
Jonah sits in a little booth
that he has constructed and God

00:16:07.816 --> 00:16:10.750
causes a leafy plant to grow
over him,

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:15.029
providing shade and saving him
from a good deal of discomfort.

00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:18.749
And the plant is to be the
source of a final lesson for

00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:21.929
Jonah.
Jonah 4:6-11:

00:16:21.929 --> 00:16:23.950
…Jonah was very happy
about the plant.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.797
But the next day at dawn God
provided a worm,

00:16:26.797 --> 00:16:29.840
which attacked the plant so
that it withered.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.440
And when the sun rose,
God provided a sultry east

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.979
wind;
and the sun beat down on

00:16:33.979 --> 00:16:35.669
Jonah's head,
and he became faint.

00:16:35.669 --> 00:16:37.972
He begged for death,
saying, "I would rather die

00:16:37.972 --> 00:16:39.996
than live."
Then God said to Jonah,

00:16:39.996 --> 00:16:42.710
"Are you so deeply grieved
about the plant?"

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.679
"Yes," he replied,
"so deeply that I want to die."

00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:48.309
Then the Lord said,
"You cared about the plant,

00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:51.509
which you did not work for and
which you did not grow,

00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:54.330
which appeared overnight and
perished overnight.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.882
And should not I care about
Nineveh, that great city,

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:59.679
in which there are more than a
hundred and twenty thousand

00:16:59.679 --> 00:17:02.330
persons who do not yet know
their right hand from their

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.819
left,
and many beasts as well!"

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:08.700
How could Yahweh not be
compassionate?

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.612
For even the most evil of
peoples are no less his creation

00:17:12.612 --> 00:17:15.769
that he has cared for,
than precious Israel.

00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:18.920
And if they will only turn to
Him in humility,

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.559
he'll wipe the slate clean,
he'll show compassion and

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:24.964
forgive.
It is only human to long for

00:17:24.964 --> 00:17:26.640
the punishment of the wicked.
 

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.609
But God longs for their
re-formation,

00:17:29.609 --> 00:17:32.396
their turning.
The date of the book of Jonah

00:17:32.396 --> 00:17:35.531
really can't be ascertained and
you will hear arguments in both

00:17:35.531 --> 00:17:38.130
directions.
Many scholars date it late;

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.984
others suppose that the story
is at least at base an old,

00:17:41.984 --> 00:17:45.155
old story.
Nineveh appears as another

00:17:45.155 --> 00:17:46.779
Sodom, basically.
 

00:17:46.779 --> 00:17:51.078
It's a story that is in keeping
with that older Torah tradition

00:17:51.078 --> 00:17:55.377
in which it's assumed that God
punishes non-Israelites or other

00:17:55.377 --> 00:17:59.215
nations for immorality,
but not necessarily for

00:17:59.215 --> 00:18:01.730
idolatry.
The gentile sailors even,

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.853
who worship others,
are not necessarily punished

00:18:04.853 --> 00:18:07.320
and in fact,
it's said that they revere God

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.819
and they're reluctant to throw
this man overboard.

00:18:09.819 --> 00:18:12.810
Other nations are not
obligated, in the view of this

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.860
book as in the early traditions
of Genesis, to accept

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.766
monotheism.
But they're bound by a certain

00:18:18.766 --> 00:18:21.603
basic moral law,
maybe the moral law of the

00:18:21.603 --> 00:18:24.778
Noahide covenant,
and it's for this that God has

00:18:24.778 --> 00:18:26.400
decreed punishment.
 

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.730
So the theme or the basic
problem in this short book is

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.690
the problem of God's justice
verses his mercy.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.529
And Jonah is a champion of
divine justice.

00:18:35.529 --> 00:18:38.980
He believes that sin should be
punished, he's outraged at God's

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.673
forgiveness.
But Jonah learns that a change

00:18:41.673 --> 00:18:45.501
of heart is enough to obtain
mercy, and that the true role of

00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:49.010
the prophet is perhaps to move
people to reformation and

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.352
turning.
What must have been the

00:18:51.352 --> 00:18:54.640
reception of this book in the
post-exilic period?

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.933
Again, not knowing exactly when
it was written--We can imagine,

00:18:57.933 --> 00:19:00.430
however, in the manner of a
canonical critic,

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.019
how it might have been
perceived by people in the

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:06.309
post-exilic period for whom it
would have become canonical.

00:19:06.309 --> 00:19:10.676
The very idea of a prophet
being sent to Nineveh--Nineveh

00:19:10.676 --> 00:19:14.029
the capital of the hated
Assyrian empire,

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:17.235
the home of the people who had
destroyed the Northern Kingdom

00:19:17.235 --> 00:19:19.799
of Israel and the ten tribes of
Israel in 722,

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:23.302
dispersing those ten tribes
forever, the nation that had

00:19:23.302 --> 00:19:27.250
then laid siege to Jerusalem and
exacted tribute from Judah for

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.180
many years--this must have been
startling.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.150
Ultimately then,
this book would represent a

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.364
strand of thought in post-exilic
Judah that differed very much

00:19:37.364 --> 00:19:41.508
from the eschatological fervor
that delighted in fantasies of

00:19:41.508 --> 00:19:44.410
the destruction of Israel's
enemies,

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.837
such as we found in Joel and as
would be featured later in

00:19:47.837 --> 00:19:51.144
Daniel, and in post-biblical
apocalyptic literature most

00:19:51.144 --> 00:19:53.849
notably the Christian book of
Revelation.

00:19:53.849 --> 00:19:57.685
The book of Jonah reminded
Israel that the universal God is

00:19:57.685 --> 00:20:01.851
desirous of the reformation and
the turning of all his creation,

00:20:01.851 --> 00:20:03.240
human and animal.
 

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.091
And proposes that the Israelite
prophet is called upon to carry

00:20:07.091 --> 00:20:10.073
a message of divine forgiveness
to other nations,

00:20:10.073 --> 00:20:11.440
not just judgment.
 

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.339
Even those that have humiliated
and despised God's chosen.

00:20:16.339 --> 00:20:19.274
So wittingly or unwittingly,
we may never know,

00:20:19.274 --> 00:20:22.847
the author of this little
satire fostered the post-exilic

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:25.910
sense of Israel as a light unto
the nations.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:30.549
This is an idea that we've
already seen in some of the late

00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:32.230
prophetic writings.
 

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:36.750
Just a few words of conclusion.
 

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.972
The literature of the Hebrew
Bible relates the odyssey of

00:20:40.972 --> 00:20:44.892
Israel from its earliest
beginnings in the stories of

00:20:44.892 --> 00:20:49.114
individual Patriarchs worshiping
a Canaanite deity to its

00:20:49.114 --> 00:20:53.638
maturity as a nation forced by
history to look beyond its own

00:20:53.638 --> 00:20:55.900
horizons and concerns.
 

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.500
The Israelites were lifted up
to become something greater than

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.329
they could ever have planned.
 

00:21:01.329 --> 00:21:04.774
They came to see themselves as
God's servants to the world,

00:21:04.774 --> 00:21:08.158
at the same time that they
struggled and argued with their

00:21:08.158 --> 00:21:11.721
God and criticized themselves
for their very human weaknesses

00:21:11.721 --> 00:21:14.876
and failings.
From another vantage point,

00:21:14.876 --> 00:21:19.080
the Bible can be seen also as
an anthology that struggles

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.809
against great odds to sustain a
peoples' covenantal relationship

00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:27.101
with God.
The contrast between reality

00:21:27.101 --> 00:21:31.824
and the religious-moral ideal
that good prospers and evil is

00:21:31.824 --> 00:21:36.788
defeated was a distressing and
perplexing problem that occupied

00:21:36.788 --> 00:21:38.869
the biblical writers.
 

00:21:38.869 --> 00:21:42.114
The existence of evil,
the suffering of the righteous,

00:21:42.114 --> 00:21:45.637
the defeat of God's chosen,
all this seemed basically

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:49.061
incompatible with certain
fundamental monotheistic

00:21:49.061 --> 00:21:51.989
intuitions;
that God holds supreme power in

00:21:51.989 --> 00:21:54.567
the universe,
that God is essentially good

00:21:54.567 --> 00:21:57.899
and just, and his providential
care extends throughout

00:21:57.899 --> 00:22:00.871
creation.
How can faith in such a God be

00:22:00.871 --> 00:22:03.799
upheld in the face of evil and
suffering?

00:22:03.799 --> 00:22:06.843
Although, all ancient
cultures--and modern

00:22:06.843 --> 00:22:10.034
cultures--struggle with the
problem of evil,

00:22:10.034 --> 00:22:13.819
it had particular poignancy for
ancient Israel.

00:22:13.819 --> 00:22:17.189
In other Ancient Near Eastern
literatures, we find doubt about

00:22:17.189 --> 00:22:19.619
the existence of a moral order,
certainly.

00:22:19.619 --> 00:22:23.354
But only in Israel does the
question of evil touch on the

00:22:23.354 --> 00:22:27.690
very essence of God and the very
foundation of religious faith.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.630
Paganism posits the existence
of primordial evil demons or

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:35.640
gods, and thus the existence of
evil and suffering does not

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.130
impugn the good gods themselves.
 

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.984
Later religious systems that
grow out of the Bible will in

00:22:41.984 --> 00:22:44.960
fact increasingly posit demons
or a devil.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.762
Second Temple Judaism,
later-rabbinic Judaism,

00:22:47.762 --> 00:22:49.755
and most especially
Christianity,

00:22:49.755 --> 00:22:53.430
will posit some devil to
account for evil in the world.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.492
Undeserved suffering,
outrageous and frustrating as

00:22:56.492 --> 00:22:59.493
it might be, can then be
explained at least by the

00:22:59.493 --> 00:23:02.922
jealousy or the caprice of the
evil angels or gods or the

00:23:02.922 --> 00:23:06.806
demons or devil,
who are indifferent to man's

00:23:06.806 --> 00:23:09.318
fate.
But in biblical religion there

00:23:09.318 --> 00:23:11.549
is no independent evil
principal.

00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:15.453
And so, undeserved suffering
and rampant evil impugn the

00:23:15.453 --> 00:23:18.150
goodness and justice of God
himself.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:22.569
Biblical persons have no refuge
from evil and suffering other

00:23:22.569 --> 00:23:24.779
than faith in God's justice.
 

00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:29.292
And if that justice is slow in
coming, then despair and doubt

00:23:29.292 --> 00:23:31.123
threaten.
For this reason,

00:23:31.123 --> 00:23:34.197
Israelite theodicy,
I think, is charged with great

00:23:34.197 --> 00:23:36.769
pathos because the stakes are so
high.

00:23:36.769 --> 00:23:40.065
If one loses faith in an
essentially moral universe,

00:23:40.065 --> 00:23:42.731
one loses God.
Or at least as we saw in the

00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:46.461
Book of Job, one loses a God who
governs the world according to a

00:23:46.461 --> 00:23:47.859
clear moral standard.
 

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:51.564
But the biblical writers don't
approach the problem as

00:23:51.564 --> 00:23:54.079
philosophers or theologians
might.

00:23:54.079 --> 00:23:56.826
For the philosopher,
theodicy, the problem of evil

00:23:56.826 --> 00:23:59.910
is primarily a logical problem,
it's a contradiction.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:03.214
How can a just and good God
allow evil and suffering to

00:24:03.214 --> 00:24:04.500
exist in the world?
 

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.048
And like any other logical
problem, it's best

00:24:07.048 --> 00:24:09.365
solved--according to the
philosophers and

00:24:09.365 --> 00:24:12.841
theologians--through the careful
construction of a systematic

00:24:12.841 --> 00:24:15.601
argument.
This is not the method or the

00:24:15.601 --> 00:24:17.819
approach of the biblical
writers.

00:24:17.819 --> 00:24:21.140
For them, the problem is not
philosophical;

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.728
it is personal,
it is psychological,

00:24:23.728 --> 00:24:27.091
it is spiritual.
The burning question is really

00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:30.884
this, how can one sustain a
commitment to Israel's God in

00:24:30.884 --> 00:24:34.880
the face of national catastrophe
and personal suffering?

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.192
How can one have the strength
to embrace, to trust,

00:24:38.192 --> 00:24:41.903
to love this God knowing that
unpredictable suffering and

00:24:41.903 --> 00:24:45.680
chaos have struck and may again
strike at any moment?

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.106
And various writers from
various periods add their voices

00:24:49.106 --> 00:24:52.533
to Israel's struggle to come to
terms with the problem of

00:24:52.533 --> 00:24:55.960
sustaining faith in the midst of
evil and suffering.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.968
The Bible's aim is not to solve
the philosophical problem of

00:24:59.968 --> 00:25:04.113
theodicy, so much as it is to
enable the relationship with God

00:25:04.113 --> 00:25:07.702
to survive all shocks,
to make life in covenant with

00:25:07.702 --> 00:25:10.467
God a viable option,
despite the evil and the

00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:13.609
suffering that are experienced
by the faithful.

00:25:13.609 --> 00:25:17.755
The Bible doesn't offer one
single model of how to cope with

00:25:17.755 --> 00:25:20.320
this problem.
A dynamic relationship with

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.677
what is perceived to be a living
personal God rather than the

00:25:23.677 --> 00:25:28.549
static God of the philosophers,
is too complex to be captured

00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:32.029
in a single dimensional
theology.

00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:34.987
Systematic theology could not
do justice to the variegated

00:25:34.987 --> 00:25:37.789
experiences of the nation and of
an individual life,

00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:41.013
and that's not the mode or
genre chosen by the biblical

00:25:41.013 --> 00:25:43.095
writers.
And so various models are

00:25:43.095 --> 00:25:45.827
presented, not all consistent
with one another,

00:25:45.827 --> 00:25:49.392
but each serving a particular
segment of the community coping

00:25:49.392 --> 00:25:52.599
with a particular challenge at a
particular time.

00:25:52.599 --> 00:25:56.075
Each is an attempt to sustain
Israel's relationship with God

00:25:56.075 --> 00:25:59.549
in the face of challenges to
that continued relationship.

00:25:59.549 --> 00:26:03.220
Biblical writers tell stories
and they interpret history in

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.321
order to illustrate the many
ways in which various

00:26:06.321 --> 00:26:08.980
individuals and the nation as a
whole,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:13.186
have managed to make sense of
the covenantal relationship with

00:26:13.186 --> 00:26:15.315
God.
There's room for multiple

00:26:15.315 --> 00:26:19.640
models, multiple images of God
and his relationship to Israel.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.468
And as modern readers of the
Bible, we can only marvel at

00:26:23.468 --> 00:26:27.160
this unresolved polyphony in
this ancient anthology.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.991
It's as if the rabbis who were
later to canonize this

00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:33.150
collection saw the truth in the
words of Qohelet,

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.198
that to everything there is a
season and a time for every

00:26:36.198 --> 00:26:37.450
purpose under heaven.
 

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.727
And so they included books with
very different approaches to the

00:26:40.727 --> 00:26:43.589
fundamental problems that face
the ancient Israelites as

00:26:43.589 --> 00:26:45.410
Israelites and as human beings.
 

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.498
So after 586 BCE,
the Deuteronomist salvaged

00:26:48.498 --> 00:26:52.233
Yahwism from going the way of
other defeated national

00:26:52.233 --> 00:26:56.686
religions by arguing that Israel
had suffered not because God's

00:26:56.686 --> 00:27:01.140
promises weren't true but
because they weren't believed.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.351
And this enabled the Israelites
to continue faithful to their

00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:06.760
God, despite the destruction of
his sanctuary,

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.579
his chosen city and his ruler.
 

00:27:08.579 --> 00:27:12.137
The prophets emphasized the
moral and communal aspects of

00:27:12.137 --> 00:27:15.504
the covenant without which all
sacrificial worship was

00:27:15.504 --> 00:27:17.838
anathema.
And so they unwittingly

00:27:17.838 --> 00:27:21.380
prepared the way for a worship
without sacrifice in the

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.609
Diaspora, and in later Judaism.
 

00:27:23.609 --> 00:27:27.019
The Psalms give expression to
the deepest emotions of the

00:27:27.019 --> 00:27:30.307
worshiper struggling with
personal despair and anger or

00:27:30.307 --> 00:27:32.559
brimming over with joy and
faith.

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:36.863
Job gives vent to the outrage
we feel over unjust suffering,

00:27:36.863 --> 00:27:40.729
while Ecclesiastes preaches
existential pleasures as a

00:27:40.729 --> 00:27:44.230
solace for the vanity of all
human endeavor.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:47.299
Ezra and Nehemiah confront the
very real problem of

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:51.289
assimilation and identity with a
call to Israel to close ranks,

00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:55.616
while Jonah and Ruth remind
Jews of the universal providence

00:27:55.616 --> 00:27:58.769
of their God and the power of
repentance.

00:27:58.769 --> 00:28:01.720
Esther and Daniel provide
encouragement of radically

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.901
different types for Jews under
threat of persecution and

00:28:04.901 --> 00:28:08.430
massacre – one a plea for
self-reliance and solidarity,

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.303
and the other,
a promise of divine

00:28:10.303 --> 00:28:12.119
intervention in an apocalypse.
 

00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:14.430
Do all these books contradict
each other?

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:17.814
No more than I contradict
myself when I say that today I

00:28:17.814 --> 00:28:20.460
feel happy, but yesterday I felt
anxious.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:24.225
Israel's relationship with God
has always been a dynamic and a

00:28:24.225 --> 00:28:26.765
complex one.
To each of these books there

00:28:26.765 --> 00:28:30.414
was a time and a purpose in the
past, and as countless readers

00:28:30.414 --> 00:28:33.884
of the Bible have discovered
over the centuries these books

00:28:33.884 --> 00:28:37.174
offer continued teaching and
inspiration in the shifting

00:28:37.174 --> 00:28:38.849
moments of every age.
 

00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:41.450
Thank you very much for your
attention this semester.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:46.018
Don't forget the review session
that will be held here with me

00:28:46.018 --> 00:28:48.190
next week from 10:30-12:30.
 

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.356
And you're early;
you get to go home ten minutes

00:28:50.356 --> 00:28:54.000
early.
Thank you.

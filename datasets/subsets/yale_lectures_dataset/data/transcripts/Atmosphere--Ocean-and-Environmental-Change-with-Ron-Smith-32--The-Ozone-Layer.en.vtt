00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.867
RONALD SMITH: OK, so we're going
to do the stratospheric

00:00:03.867 --> 00:00:07.133
ozone problem today.

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:12.833
And these are the new
terminology you

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:13.833
should be aware of.

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:19.367
So we'll talk about the ozone
layer and then the ozone hole.

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:23.767
The Dobson unit I'll discuss,
I'll define as a measure of

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:27.667
column integrated ozone
concentration.

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:32.400
We'll be talking about CFCs
which had been used as the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.333
primary liquid in
refrigerators.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.700
And you need to have a fluid
that flows back and forth

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.100
between the cold sink and the
warm sink in a refrigerator.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.800
And CFCs was the common
chemical to do that.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.967
But now they've been replaced
largely by HCFCs, the

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:00.767
hydrochlorofluorocarbons.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:05.900
Say that 10 times fast. And so
I'll define those as well.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.733
We'll talk at some point today
about polar stratospheric

00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:13.667
clouds, catalytic reactions,
which are reactions in which

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:17.400
one particular chemical compound
allows the reaction

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.267
to go forward but in the end
itself isn't changed.

00:01:22.267 --> 00:01:25.733
So it can be reused over and
over again to make the same

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.933
chemical cycle go forward.

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.267
Photochemical reactions, which
are chemical reactions that

00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:31.567
involve light.

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:34.133
You have to have photons of
light in order for that

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.133
reaction to go forward.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.933
And we'll talk about the
Montreal Protocol.

00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:42.467
So all this will come
in turn today.

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:46.233
First of all, I showed this
diagram last time as we

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:49.900
discussed this part of the ozone
issue, but now we're

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.667
going to talk about
the ozone layer.

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:56.133
And as it says here, contains
90% of the atmospheric ozone.

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:59.300
So if you do a column
integration from the top of

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.200
the atmosphere to the bottom,
most of the contribution comes

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.567
from the ozone layer.

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:11.500
What's plotted here is the
partial pressure of ozone in

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.767
milliPascals.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.667
Remember that the total
pressure, the air pressure,

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:24.100
decreases strongly and
exponentially all the way on

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.600
up through the troposphere
and the stratosphere.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.967
So this has a very different
vertical structure than the

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:33.467
total pressure.

00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:38.267
It has a beneficial role, it
acts as a shield against

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:42.033
ultraviolet radiation that would
otherwise cause skin

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:44.733
cancer, skin damage.

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:50.467
And the current trends are a
long-term global downtrend in

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:51.700
stratospheric ozone.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.800
And then most famously, this
ozone hole which occurs in the

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.067
springtime of the Antarctic part
of the earth each year.

00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:08.933
And then some more recent
discussion about possibly this

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:11.733
starting up in the Northern
Hemisphere as well, but this

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.700
is not as well documented.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.433
So just a couple of
calculations then.

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:32.067
So I want to compute the mixing
ratio in ppmv for ozone

00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:36.967
to air using this point
on this slide.

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:42.967
So I'm going to say that at
about 24 kilometers altitude

00:03:42.967 --> 00:03:46.967
you've got a partial pressure
of ozone that's about 30

00:03:46.967 --> 00:03:48.233
milliPascals.

00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:50.567
And I want to convert that to a
mixing ratio because that's

00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:55.500
what we've been used to using,
what we used last time.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.700
So first of all, because it's
going to be a mixing ratio you

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.033
need to know how much air is up
there as well, not just how

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:03.400
much ozone, but how much air.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.100
So I'm going to use this simple
formula that we've used

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.767
quite often in the course.

00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:13.633
It's the approximate exponential
form for pressure

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:18.300
as a function of altitude
where you use a scale

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.467
height, H sub s.

00:04:20.467 --> 00:04:23.233
You know the pressure at the
surface of the earth, you know

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:25.967
the altitude you're inquiring
about, and this will give you

00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:27.200
the pressure at that altitude

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.833
So sea level pressure we'll take
to be 1,013 millibars,

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:34.200
which is the standard
average value,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.933
convert that to Pascals.

00:04:35.933 --> 00:04:40.433
The scale height as you recall
is RT over g, which is about

00:04:40.433 --> 00:04:44.800
8,400 meters for the earth--the
earth's atmosphere.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.533
So I'll put 24 kilometers up
here, that scale height there,

00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:52.867
and I'll put the sea level
pressure there, and that's

00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:53.733
this formula here.

00:04:53.733 --> 00:04:58.100
So I put everything where I said
I would and I get a value

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:06.933
of about 6,000 Pascals for
the air pressure up here.

00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:11.600
And then I can simply put that
into a ratio of the two

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.267
pressures to get the mixing
ratio in the common units.

00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:27.200
So I put in that the value of
0.03/6,000, I get 20 ppmv for

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.967
the ozone mixing ratio in the
peak of the ozone layer.

00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:35.400
OK?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.400
Pretty straightforward
calculation.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.933
Had to find out how much air
was there and then from the

00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:43.067
proper ratio get it in
the proper units.

00:05:43.067 --> 00:05:45.100
Now compare this to what we were
talking about last time.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.367
The EPA one hour standard for
ozone in the boundary layer,

00:05:50.367 --> 00:05:56.500
where we live, was 0.12
in those same units.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.400
So the ozone concentration in
the ozone layer is about 200

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.200
times the EPA one hour limit,
just to give you a relative

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.067
sense for that.

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:15.300
So if we were up there, that
would be really tough for us

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.133
to breathe that in.

00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:18.900
Now remember however, there's
not enough air to keep us

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.233
alive anyway at those
altitudes.

00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:25.700
But the ozone concentration
is quite large as well.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.467
So that's an inhospitable
environment up

00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:30.867
there at that altitude.

00:06:30.867 --> 00:06:32.100
Any questions on that?

00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:41.533
But it is possible, or it was
until recently, possible for

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:46.100
us to fly at those altitudes.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.067
So the Concorde, this beautiful,
supersonic,

00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:53.533
commercial airliner which
stopped flying a couple years

00:06:53.533 --> 00:06:59.733
ago, it flew at an altitude
typically of 17 kilometers,

00:06:59.733 --> 00:07:02.500
which isn't quite at the peak
of the ozone concentration,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.467
but it's definitely up in the
ozone layer, there's no doubt

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.067
about that.

00:07:07.067 --> 00:07:09.567
And of course, you have to
refresh the cabin air.

00:07:09.567 --> 00:07:13.833
You can't just lock the cabin
doors and expect everybody to

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:17.600
live off that cabin air until
you get to your destination.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.367
So the aircraft can continually
draw in air from

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:26.533
outside to flush the cabin and
give you fresh cabin air.

00:07:26.533 --> 00:07:28.833
The question is how do you
do that in this case?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.767
Remember though that there's
two problems. First of all,

00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:35.467
there's very little air
outside anyway.

00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:38.767
So you're going to have to
compress it with some kind of

00:07:38.767 --> 00:07:43.133
a pump before you can put it
into the cabin so people can

00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:44.000
breathe it.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.033
And that's going to be
a big compression.

00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:50.000
Let's just think about
this for a minute.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.200
So if you're flying at 17
kilometers and you want to get

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.367
that air compressed to cabin
pressure, well first of all

00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:04.867
what cabin pressure do
you normally have?

00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:09.500
Airliners don't usually keep
you at sea level pressure.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.700
If you're taking off from New
York City, as you take off the

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.133
pressure will drop--

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:18.633
in the cabin will drop as you
climb, but they'll usually

00:08:18.633 --> 00:08:23.667
only let it drop to maybe an
equivalent altitude of 6,000

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:25.033
feet, something like that.

00:08:25.033 --> 00:08:27.733
Then they couldn't let it go
any lower or you'd start to

00:08:27.733 --> 00:08:29.933
have trouble breathing,
but they don't

00:08:29.933 --> 00:08:31.900
keep you at sea level.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:37.100
So I'm going to assume that the,
for this calculation that

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.967
the cabin altitude, what's
called the cabin altitude, is

00:08:42.967 --> 00:08:44.833
going to be kept at
2 kilometers.

00:08:44.833 --> 00:08:49.467
That's about 6,000 feet
above the surface.

00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:52.167
In fact, you're flying at 17
kilometers, so you've got to

00:08:52.167 --> 00:08:55.533
take air and compress it just
as you would if you took a

00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:58.833
parcel of air from 17 kilometers
and brought it down

00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:02.233
to two kilometers, it would
compress, adiabatic

00:09:02.233 --> 00:09:03.833
compression, we've
talked about this

00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:04.767
over and over again.

00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:07.700
And it would heat as
you compress it.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.167
So when you put it into that
pump and compress it, it's

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:12.700
going to warm up,
and how much?

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.967
Well this is a calculation
you can do in your head.

00:09:14.967 --> 00:09:19.633
You know the adiabatic lapse
rate is about 10 degrees per

00:09:19.633 --> 00:09:23.500
kilometer, actually it's 9.8,
but I've rounded it off.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.500
That's a difference in 15
kilometers, so essentially

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:31.500
you're going to get 150 degrees
Celsius warming when

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.600
you compress that air
about ready to

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.567
put it into the cabin.

00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:39.100
Now you're going to--it started
off pretty cold, but

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.000
still that's going to
be really hot air.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.167
Two things I've got
to say about that.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:47.433
First of all, the convenient
thing is that that temperature

00:09:47.433 --> 00:09:50.133
will destroy the ozone.

00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:53.767
So just by compressing the air,
getting it ready to put

00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:56.767
into the cabin, you're going
to kill off that ozone

00:09:56.767 --> 00:09:58.100
automatically.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.400
So that's pretty convenient.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.533
But then remember, you're going
to have to cool it a bit

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:03.900
before you put it
into the cabin.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.533
So you're going to put it
through another heat

00:10:05.533 --> 00:10:09.267
exchanger, cool it back down,
and then you get the air to

00:10:09.267 --> 00:10:11.233
stick into the cabin.

00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:14.600
If you don't get it all out, you
can pass the air through

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.533
an activated charcoal filter
and that will remove any

00:10:19.533 --> 00:10:22.900
remaining ozone that's
in the air before you

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.833
put it into the cabin.

00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:27.200
So it is possible to fly at
those altitudes right in the

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.233
middle of the ozone layer.

00:10:28.233 --> 00:10:30.900
But that's how you
have to do it.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.333
Any questions on that?

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:33.033
Yeah?

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:34.100
STUDENT: Why would you
want to fly at

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.833
that high of an altitude?

00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:38.633
PROFESSOR: It turns out it has
mostly to do with

00:10:38.633 --> 00:10:41.500
the efficiency of the engines.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.467
In fact, that's true with
subsonic aircraft as well.

00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:49.300
The reason they fly quite high,
35,000 feet, 37,000 feet

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.767
is because the engines are most

00:10:50.767 --> 00:10:52.700
efficient at that altitude.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.800
And for this aircraft, the more
efficient--the altitude

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.200
was even higher at
17 kilometers.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.500
So anything on that?

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.600
OK, maybe that's a little
tangential point, but--

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.233
This thing called the Dobson
unit is a column density.

00:11:11.233 --> 00:11:15.300
We could write it, in fact, I
wish that they had chosen the

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.267
unit of kilograms per
square meter.

00:11:18.267 --> 00:11:22.367
You'd simply integrate top to
bottom in the atmosphere and

00:11:22.367 --> 00:11:26.467
say how many kilograms of ozone
are there in each square

00:11:26.467 --> 00:11:29.733
meter of footprint for
that column that

00:11:29.733 --> 00:11:30.667
you've integrated over.

00:11:30.667 --> 00:11:34.667
But for historic reasons they
didn't do it that way.

00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:38.967
This is typically measured by
looking at light coming from

00:11:38.967 --> 00:11:42.300
the sun and see how much
ultraviolet light reaches the

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.767
surface of the earth.

00:11:44.767 --> 00:11:46.400
And that will tell you
how much ozone

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.800
there is in the column.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.067
What they're using for the
Dobson unit is this

00:11:51.067 --> 00:11:54.967
definition, it's 1
milli-atmosphere-centimeters.

00:11:54.967 --> 00:11:58.633
That's the scientific definition
of a Dobson unit.

00:11:58.633 --> 00:12:00.367
And here's how you
think about that.

00:12:00.367 --> 00:12:04.300
You take all the ozone in the
column, you compress it to

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.767
standard temperature and
pressure, that is 1 atmosphere

00:12:07.767 --> 00:12:12.267
of pressure and 0
degrees Celsius.

00:12:12.267 --> 00:12:16.900
And then you measure how thick
that layer would be composed

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.867
just of ozone and you measure
that in thousandth of a

00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:22.200
centimeter.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.067
And that is your Dobson
unit value.

00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:28.967
And I'll be showing you
this kind of data.

00:12:28.967 --> 00:12:32.667
Typical values for the earth's
atmosphere run from 100 to 500

00:12:32.667 --> 00:12:34.867
Dobson units depending
on where you

00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:36.600
are around the world.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.000
But that is normally--

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.900
the Dobson is what we use to
describe to each other how

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.367
much ozone there is
in the atmosphere.

00:12:46.367 --> 00:12:50.333
So for example, you'll see a
diagram like this from NASA.

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:53.200
It's a map of the world and
some areas are blocked out

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.567
because they don't have data
from here for this particular

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.067
time of year.

00:12:58.067 --> 00:13:02.433
But the scale is in
Dobson units.

00:13:02.433 --> 00:13:06.667
So in the tropical regions
you're getting values of about

00:13:06.667 --> 00:13:10.300
250, 260 Dobson units.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.267
In the green you're getting
values maybe 325, maybe in

00:13:14.267 --> 00:13:16.667
some areas even 350 or 360.

00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:24.300
So that's the way we represent
column integrated ozone in

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.867
this subject.

00:13:26.867 --> 00:13:30.600
We can also get vertical profile
information either by

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.000
direct in situ measurements or
by looking at light passing

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.767
across the earth's atmosphere
horizontally.

00:13:37.767 --> 00:13:41.000
This gives you some idea where
the ozone layer is as a

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.600
function of latitude.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.967
So here's latitude,
North Pole, South

00:13:45.967 --> 00:13:48.300
Pole, Equator, altitude.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.400
But notice the offset 0, this
isn't the ground, this is

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.933
starting at 16 kilometers,
right?

00:13:54.933 --> 00:14:03.433
So the ozone layer at higher
latitudes, it peaks at an

00:14:03.433 --> 00:14:08.500
altitude of about 20 kilometers,
18, 19, 20

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.200
kilometers.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:15.300
But near the Equator, it's up
around 25, 26 kilometers.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.500
I think we expected this
because remember the

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.867
tropopause has the same
kind of a structure.

00:14:20.867 --> 00:14:24.300
It's higher in the equatorial
regions and lower

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.467
in the polar regions.

00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:31.133
So the ozone layer is about
the same place in the

00:14:31.133 --> 00:14:34.000
stratosphere, but the
stratosphere starts at a

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.267
different level.

00:14:35.267 --> 00:14:39.033
So it's lifted in a sense
relative to the surface of the

00:14:39.033 --> 00:14:46.100
earth in the equatorial
latitudes.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.167
The reason why--part of the
reason why there is that

00:14:47.167 --> 00:14:50.433
difference is because of a broad
circulation that takes

00:14:50.433 --> 00:14:54.367
place in the stratosphere calls
call the Brewer-Dobson

00:14:54.367 --> 00:14:57.867
circulation, which I won't talk
about, but this artist

00:14:57.867 --> 00:15:02.267
has reminded us that there is
this broad slow circulation in

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:03.500
the stratosphere.

00:15:05.367 --> 00:15:10.433
So why do we have ozone
in the stratosphere?

00:15:10.433 --> 00:15:13.967
This is a basic chemistry
of that.

00:15:13.967 --> 00:15:17.733
We know we have a lot of O2 in
our atmosphere, it's the

00:15:17.733 --> 00:15:20.900
second most common molecule.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.967
And occasionally, a high
energy photon will

00:15:23.967 --> 00:15:24.867
come from the sun.

00:15:24.867 --> 00:15:30.767
A high energy ultraviolet photon
will dissociate that

00:15:30.767 --> 00:15:35.733
diatomic oxygen into two oxygen
atoms. It doesn't

00:15:35.733 --> 00:15:38.033
happen very often because
it needs a high energy

00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:39.733
photon to do that.

00:15:39.733 --> 00:15:44.500
But then you've got some free
oxygen atoms floating around.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.767
And when you have that, that'll
quickly combine with

00:15:47.767 --> 00:15:50.900
an O2 molecule to form ozone.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.567
That's a fast reaction.

00:15:53.567 --> 00:15:58.700
But equally fast is that other
ultraviolet photons, they

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.700
don't have to be as energetic
as this one, these can be in

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:08.267
the near, or in the UVA, for
example, the near ultraviolet,

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:12.033
will dissociate that
back to this again.

00:16:12.033 --> 00:16:12.833
And that's fast.

00:16:12.833 --> 00:16:18.033
So what you've got is a rapid
recycling going on between

00:16:18.033 --> 00:16:23.200
that and that that's just going
out all the time in the

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.800
stratosphere, but maintaining
a balance here.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.833
Now occasionally an ozone will
interact with one of these

00:16:30.833 --> 00:16:35.533
atoms and go back to go to O2,
which is the common form.

00:16:35.533 --> 00:16:37.767
And then you've lost it.

00:16:37.767 --> 00:16:43.500
So you've lost the ozone
permanently or at least quasi

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.267
permanently.

00:16:44.267 --> 00:16:49.100
So the ozone concentration is
controlled by--ignoring this

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.500
rapid cycling which doesn't have
any long-term effect, is

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.567
controlled by the balance of
these two slow processes.

00:16:56.567 --> 00:17:01.533
How often are you producing
oxygen atoms and how often are

00:17:01.533 --> 00:17:06.167
you removing ozone and oxygen
atoms back to O2?

00:17:06.167 --> 00:17:08.767
And that would be occurring
naturally because we have

00:17:08.767 --> 00:17:12.300
oxygen in the atmosphere and
we have ultraviolet light

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.933
coming from the sun.

00:17:13.933 --> 00:17:17.800
So that's the background to
why there is ozone in the

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.667
stratosphere.

00:17:19.667 --> 00:17:21.900
The reason why it doesn't happen
further down is because

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.967
most of these ultraviolet
photons are absorbed up there

00:17:25.967 --> 00:17:29.300
and don't get--don't penetrate
deeper into the atmosphere.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.367
So it's a layer up there because
that's where these

00:17:32.367 --> 00:17:37.233
ultraviolet photons are being
absorbed and doing this work

00:17:37.233 --> 00:17:42.133
causing these photochemical
reactions to take place.

00:17:42.133 --> 00:17:43.467
Questions on that?

00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:46.500
STUDENT: I'm curious if there
is some sort of feedback

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.300
mechanism or if the two slow
reactions are interconnected

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:50.800
in some way.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.533
Because I guess if you have more
free oxygen atoms that

00:17:54.533 --> 00:18:02.400
would allow the second process
to occur more frequently?

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.667
PROFESSOR: Well you'd have to
write down the

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.400
rate equations for these to
answer that question, which

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.467
I'm not prepared to do.

00:18:07.467 --> 00:18:14.533
But a chemical reaction, the
rate at which it goes forward

00:18:14.533 --> 00:18:18.033
depends on how much of this do
you have, and how much of this

00:18:18.033 --> 00:18:21.967
do you have, and how often are
they colliding to allow the

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:22.833
reaction to go forward?

00:18:22.833 --> 00:18:25.400
So I think your instinct is
right that these are going to

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.800
depend on the concentrations
that you have.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.933
So just like our tank
experiment, the loss rate was

00:18:32.933 --> 00:18:36.900
proportional to how much you
have. And that's what, in a

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:42.367
system like this where the
generation term is independent

00:18:42.367 --> 00:18:45.033
of how much of this you have,
but the loss rate is

00:18:45.033 --> 00:18:47.933
proportional, you're going to
come to an equilibrium, just

00:18:47.933 --> 00:18:49.833
like we did in the water tank.

00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:52.467
And that's what I'm implying
here, that you've got that

00:18:52.467 --> 00:18:56.900
kind of balance between a source
which is just there and

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.433
then a sink which is dependent
on how much you have. And that

00:19:00.433 --> 00:19:02.333
will give a natural equilibrium
eventually.

00:19:06.733 --> 00:19:09.667
And this is a cartoon
showing that.

00:19:09.667 --> 00:19:14.633
So the sun is playing a role.

00:19:14.633 --> 00:19:18.633
Occasionally it will dissociate
O2 to form a simple

00:19:18.633 --> 00:19:20.967
O, an O molecule.

00:19:20.967 --> 00:19:24.500
And then you get this rapid
recycling between

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.500
oxygen atoms and ozone.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.033
And then occasionally, you'll go
back just to the O2 again.

00:19:31.033 --> 00:19:34.067
And the control of how much you
have is primarily these

00:19:34.067 --> 00:19:35.733
processes, not this.

00:19:35.733 --> 00:19:38.867
This is just a rapid recycling
of the two

00:19:38.867 --> 00:19:40.100
types of odd oxygen.

00:19:42.667 --> 00:19:46.800
Now to remind you about the
spectrum of radiation coming

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.133
from the sun, I show you this,
you've seen it before.

00:19:50.133 --> 00:19:53.033
The visible spectrum is here,
the infrared, we're really

00:19:53.033 --> 00:19:57.133
interested in the ultraviolet
over here in today's

00:19:57.133 --> 00:20:01.900
conversation, which starts at
400 nanometers wavelength and

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.767
goes shorter than that.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.767
And these standard definitions
are helpful.

00:20:11.767 --> 00:20:17.267
UVA are the wavelengths closest
to the visible,

00:20:17.267 --> 00:20:22.467
closest to the blue, defined
as going from 400 to 315

00:20:22.467 --> 00:20:23.600
nanometers.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:29.567
UVB, 315 to 280, and then UVC,
280 all the way down to 100

00:20:29.567 --> 00:20:30.833
nanometers.

00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:34.400
Now you may remember from
physics of that the shorter

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.533
wavelength photons are
more energetic,

00:20:37.533 --> 00:20:38.667
they'll do more damage.

00:20:38.667 --> 00:20:45.267
So UVA would cause tanning of
your skin, but probably

00:20:45.267 --> 00:20:48.300
wouldn't give you skin
cancer, UVB might.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.200
But UVC is very damaging.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.300
In fact, it's used in
doctor's offices to

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.833
clean surgical tools.

00:20:57.833 --> 00:21:03.367
You put it into this autoclave
which will put UVC on your

00:21:03.367 --> 00:21:06.267
instruments and it'll kill
anything that's there very,

00:21:06.267 --> 00:21:06.967
very quickly.

00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:09.467
It's very damaging radiation.

00:21:12.767 --> 00:21:18.933
And so here's the fate
of UVA, UVB, and UVC.

00:21:18.933 --> 00:21:20.767
Some UVA comes through.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.967
Half or more of the UVB is
absorbed in the ozone layer,

00:21:27.967 --> 00:21:29.167
plotted on top of this.

00:21:29.167 --> 00:21:35.100
This is altitude and Dobson
units per kilometer to get

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.133
where the ozone layer is.

00:21:37.133 --> 00:21:41.067
So about 1/2 or 2/3 of the UVB
is absorbed by the ozone.

00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:46.900
And almost all, thankfully, of
the UVC coming from the sun is

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.633
absorbed by the ozone layer.

00:21:49.633 --> 00:21:54.500
So it's a very good protective
shield for us.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.633
Now what could be changing this

00:21:58.633 --> 00:22:02.867
natural ozone layer situation?

00:22:02.867 --> 00:22:07.133
Well this is the current
theory for it.

00:22:07.133 --> 00:22:12.600
It involves a catalytic reaction
primarily using

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:18.300
chlorine atoms. Now bromine will
do this as well and there

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.033
is some bromine in the
atmosphere, but I'm going to

00:22:20.033 --> 00:22:23.467
focus strictly on
the chlorine.

00:22:23.467 --> 00:22:25.300
And notice how this
reaction works.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.133
So you have a chlorine
atom reacting

00:22:28.133 --> 00:22:30.800
with an ozone molecule.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.267
It goes to ClO, it oxidizes
the chlorine and

00:22:34.267 --> 00:22:36.567
gives you back O2.

00:22:36.567 --> 00:22:41.433
And then quite soon after that,
you'll take this ClO and

00:22:41.433 --> 00:22:45.600
react it with another
ozone molecule.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:50.167
That'll give you back the Cl
that you started with and you

00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:55.367
have two O2s, two regular
diatomic oxygens.

00:22:55.367 --> 00:22:57.367
So look, the ozone is gone.

00:22:57.367 --> 00:23:00.067
In fact, two ozones are gone.

00:23:00.067 --> 00:23:04.200
And you've got your Cl back
ready to do it again.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.500
So this is a catalytic reaction
where the catalyst

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.667
here is the chlorine atom.

00:23:10.667 --> 00:23:14.667
It can be used over and over
again to destroy ozone

00:23:14.667 --> 00:23:16.900
molecules in this way.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.467
Two ozone molecules are lost
and the catalyst is free,

00:23:20.467 --> 00:23:23.767
ready to go back,
and do it again.

00:23:23.767 --> 00:23:27.900
That's the idea of what's today,
now that we have a

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.467
measurable chlorine
concentration in the

00:23:30.467 --> 00:23:33.367
atmosphere, this is why we
think the ozone layer is

00:23:33.367 --> 00:23:34.733
decreasing.

00:23:34.733 --> 00:23:36.000
Questions on that?

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:44.000
So up here in the inset
is the emission.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:52.367
This is an example,
CFC 11, one of the

00:23:52.367 --> 00:23:53.600
chlorofluorocarbons.

00:23:55.733 --> 00:24:00.267
And here's the emission rate
for it in megatons per year

00:24:00.267 --> 00:24:03.667
starting in 1960 going
up to the year 2000.

00:24:03.667 --> 00:24:06.333
So you see there was a rapid
rise in it as it was being

00:24:06.333 --> 00:24:09.133
used in refrigeration.

00:24:09.133 --> 00:24:12.000
And when you put it into a
refrigerator, it may be

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.267
contained for a few years, but
eventually it leaks out or

00:24:15.267 --> 00:24:18.700
someone tosses away the
refrigerator and it gets a

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.400
leak and it goes to
the atmosphere.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.633
So almost everything you produce
eventually makes its

00:24:23.633 --> 00:24:26.033
way into the atmosphere.

00:24:26.033 --> 00:24:30.167
The Montreal Protocol that
I'll talk about was here,

00:24:30.167 --> 00:24:32.500
where you begin to see
it finally decreased.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:38.400
But because it's a long lived
molecule, here's the CFC

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.700
abundance in the atmosphere,
it increased through this

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.567
period of time, we've stopped
putting it in,

00:24:44.567 --> 00:24:48.100
but it's still there.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.233
It has a lifetime--from this
data, it looks like the

00:24:49.233 --> 00:24:51.500
lifetime is about 50 years.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.967
And so it's going to take
probably another 50 or 100

00:24:54.967 --> 00:24:57.467
before we see much
of a decline.

00:24:57.467 --> 00:25:01.633
Thank goodness we've stopped
putting it in, but it's not

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:04.033
going to decrease to 0
just because we've

00:25:04.033 --> 00:25:05.033
stopped putting it in.

00:25:05.033 --> 00:25:08.100
It's going to be stored in the
atmosphere for a while.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.600
It has a long lifetime.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.467
The circles are data from the
Northern Hemisphere and the

00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:17.933
triangles are data from the
Southern Hemisphere.

00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:19.567
But they're pretty
much the same.

00:25:19.567 --> 00:25:22.367
So the two hemispheres,
this stuff gets

00:25:22.367 --> 00:25:24.300
mixed back and forth.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.800
Probably most of it was put
into the atmosphere in the

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.033
Northern Hemisphere, but now
it's mixed to be pretty much

00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:33.867
equal in the two hemispheres.

00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:35.100
Questions on that?

00:25:39.633 --> 00:25:45.867
Here is the global averaged
total ozone change in percent

00:25:45.867 --> 00:25:47.967
starting back in 1965.

00:25:47.967 --> 00:25:52.267
Around 1980 is when we began to
see the rapid decrease, but

00:25:52.267 --> 00:25:53.267
it's not a huge.

00:25:53.267 --> 00:25:58.233
Notice that it's leveled out
today and it's only about 4%

00:25:58.233 --> 00:26:00.333
below where it started.

00:26:00.333 --> 00:26:05.300
So this global decrease in
ozone is, I suppose it's

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.167
something we should be concerned
about, but it's not

00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:09.500
a huge factor.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.467
And it doesn't look like it's
going to get any worse now

00:26:12.467 --> 00:26:16.233
that we've stopped putting
CFCs into the atmosphere.

00:26:16.233 --> 00:26:18.167
So it's a concern, but
not I would say a

00:26:18.167 --> 00:26:22.767
terribly difficult one.

00:26:22.767 --> 00:26:25.867
But then there's this ozone hole
that I'll spend the rest

00:26:25.867 --> 00:26:27.333
of time talking about.

00:26:27.333 --> 00:26:31.433
And here's what it looked like
a couple of days ago.

00:26:31.433 --> 00:26:34.033
You can go to this website,
which I'm just about to do.

00:26:34.033 --> 00:26:35.700
I should have set
this up before.

00:26:38.267 --> 00:26:39.567
But here's a definition of it.

00:26:39.567 --> 00:26:45.100
So it's a brief, seasonal and
local reduction in ozone.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.667
Location is Antarctica, the time
of year that it happens

00:26:48.667 --> 00:26:51.933
each year is September,
October.

00:26:51.933 --> 00:26:55.167
It first appeared in about 1978,
apparently it wasn't

00:26:55.167 --> 00:26:57.533
happening before then.

00:26:57.533 --> 00:27:02.333
It was discovered in 1984 and
then going back and looking at

00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:05.733
old data, they found that it
actually had started some six

00:27:05.733 --> 00:27:08.967
years earlier than that.

00:27:08.967 --> 00:27:13.167
The discovery of the depletion
mechanism by Molina and

00:27:13.167 --> 00:27:15.933
Crutzen was a rather

00:27:15.933 --> 00:27:18.367
remarkable scientific discovery.

00:27:18.367 --> 00:27:21.567
I'll give you hints of how that
went in just a minute.

00:27:21.567 --> 00:27:24.667
And they won the Nobel Prize in
chemistry for that awarded

00:27:24.667 --> 00:27:29.333
in 1995 from that discovery
of how the ozone depletion

00:27:29.333 --> 00:27:30.967
mechanism works.

00:27:30.967 --> 00:27:34.133
Ultimately, it's caused by these
CFC emissions which then

00:27:34.133 --> 00:27:37.600
led to the Montreal Protocol,
which I'll talk briefly about,

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.000
a rather successful
international treaty to limit

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.567
the emissions of CFCs.

00:27:44.567 --> 00:27:47.200
Here's a brief history of it.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.300
So at the top is the ozone
hole area in millions of

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.233
square kilometers.

00:27:53.233 --> 00:27:56.833
What you do is set a threshold
for ozone concentration.

00:27:56.833 --> 00:27:59.533
If it's lower than that you
say you're in the hole, if

00:27:59.533 --> 00:28:02.100
it's larger than that you're
out of the hole.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.367
And then you keep track
of that area.

00:28:04.367 --> 00:28:09.833
And the ozone hole was
nonexistent before '79.

00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:17.100
But now it has reached about 25
million square kilometers,

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.600
you saw a picture of it.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.400
And it's kind of leveled out,
it's not getting it better not

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.400
getting any worse.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.633
And the minimum ozone in the
middle of that hole is shown

00:28:26.633 --> 00:28:31.767
here in Dobson units, of course,
getting worse but now

00:28:31.767 --> 00:28:36.267
leveling out to a value of about
100 Dobson units in the

00:28:36.267 --> 00:28:41.667
middle of the hole each
year when it forms.

00:28:41.667 --> 00:28:47.700
So give me just a moment here
to bring up this website.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.033
I forgot to do this before.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:02.867
Let's see here.

00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:06.167
I'll just Google and find it.

00:29:06.167 --> 00:29:07.533
Yeah, that's probably it.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.567
That's not the one I want.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.533
That's a good one, but it's not
the one I'm looking for.

00:29:18.533 --> 00:29:20.167
I'll try to find
this other one.

00:29:26.533 --> 00:29:32.167
Yeah, let's do an animation
for this season.

00:29:32.167 --> 00:29:33.400
I'll try this one.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.333
Yeah, so this is this
year's hole.

00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:46.633
It hasn't formed yet,
we're back in July.

00:29:46.633 --> 00:29:49.033
This is Antarctica sitting
there waiting.

00:29:49.033 --> 00:29:51.300
Now wait until we get
into September.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.267
It's already beginning to form
in the late summer, but now

00:29:54.267 --> 00:29:57.533
we're getting the ozone
hole forming.

00:29:57.533 --> 00:30:02.400
October, peaks in October, and
then it'll start to fill in up

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.200
to the present date.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.533
It's starting to weaken now
that we're into November.

00:30:06.533 --> 00:30:07.400
So that's the deal.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.600
It happens every year
in that region.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.933
You get this large area that
forms with about half the

00:30:14.933 --> 00:30:20.433
ozone it would otherwise have.
Ozone depletion is about 50

00:30:20.433 --> 00:30:24.067
percent in that region compared
to remember only 4

00:30:24.067 --> 00:30:25.800
percent percent globally.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.767
So this is a localized
anomaly.

00:30:33.967 --> 00:30:36.767
You can go to that website
yourself and do some other

00:30:36.767 --> 00:30:38.433
animations.

00:30:38.433 --> 00:30:43.367
So in this year then this tracks
it, the ozone hole area

00:30:43.367 --> 00:30:49.533
climbed up to the 12th of
September, now it's decreased.

00:30:49.533 --> 00:30:52.767
The minimum ozone dropped to a
minimum now it's increasing

00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:54.633
now that we're into November.

00:30:54.633 --> 00:30:56.633
And I'm going to be talking
about the stratospheric

00:30:56.633 --> 00:30:57.367
temperature.

00:30:57.367 --> 00:30:59.633
Stratospheric temperature in
that part of the world now at

00:30:59.633 --> 00:31:03.567
that altitude is beginning to
climb because we're getting

00:31:03.567 --> 00:31:07.267
out of their winter and towards
of their Southern

00:31:07.267 --> 00:31:08.467
Hemisphere summer.

00:31:08.467 --> 00:31:11.367
And I'll come back to talk about
the role of temperature

00:31:11.367 --> 00:31:14.667
in just a moment.

00:31:14.667 --> 00:31:19.967
So I think the most curious
thing about the ozone hole is

00:31:19.967 --> 00:31:23.667
why only in September
and October?

00:31:23.667 --> 00:31:27.167
Why just over the South Pole?

00:31:27.167 --> 00:31:29.267
And I guess what is the link
to human activity?

00:31:29.267 --> 00:31:32.800
So there's a lot of natural
processes and factors

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.233
controlling this.

00:31:34.233 --> 00:31:38.667
And then there's the added
impact of humans and somehow

00:31:38.667 --> 00:31:43.333
they have all come together to
form this curious phenomena of

00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:44.600
the ozone hole.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.800
In the few minutes I have left
I want to just try to explain

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.967
some of that.

00:31:50.967 --> 00:31:56.700
Now I hope you can see this,
I'll read it through for you.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.600
This is the seasonal cycle
of temperature in the

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.267
stratosphere.

00:32:01.267 --> 00:32:07.767
And this is for 90 North
to 65 North, so this is

00:32:07.767 --> 00:32:11.500
the north polar cap.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:15.500
This is 25 North to 25
South, so this is

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.533
the equatorial region.

00:32:17.533 --> 00:32:21.767
And this is 65 South to 90
South, so this is the south

00:32:21.767 --> 00:32:23.167
polar region.

00:32:23.167 --> 00:32:28.700
Now the temperatures in the
Northern Hemisphere get down

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.600
to minus 70 on occasion.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.433
These are at different
altitudes, I believe, having

00:32:35.433 --> 00:32:37.200
trouble reading those.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.733
They get down to minus 70.

00:32:39.733 --> 00:32:43.100
In the equatorial regions, those
temperatures get down to

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.333
about minus 75.

00:32:46.333 --> 00:32:50.067
But here in the South Pole, they
get down to minus 80 and

00:32:50.067 --> 00:32:52.167
even minus 85.

00:32:52.167 --> 00:32:57.100
So of all the places in the
world's stratosphere, the

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.533
Southern Hemisphere polar
stratosphere, that is over

00:33:00.533 --> 00:33:04.567
Antarctica, has a winter time
temperature colder than any

00:33:04.567 --> 00:33:07.600
other place on the planet.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.033
That's one of the things that
makes it special in regards to

00:33:11.033 --> 00:33:14.167
why the ozone hole
forms there.

00:33:14.167 --> 00:33:16.800
Now why would that be?

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:20.000
It has to do with the
phenomena of polar

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.033
stratospheric clouds,
abbreviation PSCs.

00:33:27.733 --> 00:33:27.867
Polar stratospheric clouds.

00:33:27.867 --> 00:33:30.067
I haven't spoken about these
in the course up to this

00:33:30.067 --> 00:33:33.100
present time, so this
is new material.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:38.633
These are ice clouds that form
up in the stratosphere.

00:33:38.633 --> 00:33:41.567
Normally we think clouds don't
form in the stratosphere, it's

00:33:41.567 --> 00:33:45.800
pretty dry up there, but
these clouds do.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.100
They are not entirely
made of water.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:54.000
They're a mixture of water and
nitric acid in these clouds.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.300
And they require an
extraordinarily cold

00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.767
temperature in order to form,
temperatures colder than minus

00:34:00.767 --> 00:34:05.167
70 degrees Celsius, some would
say even colder than that.

00:34:05.167 --> 00:34:12.000
This is probably why the
Antarctic stratosphere is so

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.433
special because it's temperature
gets cold enough

00:34:14.433 --> 00:34:19.567
in winter to allow these polar
stratospheric clouds to occur,

00:34:19.567 --> 00:34:22.600
whereas other places around the
globe in the stratosphere

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.033
you don't get those clouds.

00:34:25.033 --> 00:34:26.700
What do they do then?

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.867
How do they influence ozone?

00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:36.033
Well these ice clouds, these
ice particles, freeze up

00:34:36.033 --> 00:34:39.767
diatomic chlorine by
holding the nitric

00:34:39.767 --> 00:34:42.367
acid in the ice itself.

00:34:42.367 --> 00:34:48.067
Notice when it forms it's
storing HNO3, nitric acid.

00:34:48.067 --> 00:34:49.567
And here's the reaction.

00:34:49.567 --> 00:34:57.600
You start with HCl, and ClONO2,
reaction goes to Cl2

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:03.167
and the nitric acid, and then
this is locked up in the ice.

00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:07.700
So what you've done, you had
your chlorine locked up in HCl

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.233
and in this compound, there's
chlorines in both.

00:35:11.233 --> 00:35:15.400
Now you've put the nitric acid
in the ice and you've freed up

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.267
the chlorine diatomic
molecule.

00:35:18.267 --> 00:35:21.967
There's only one step to go.

00:35:21.967 --> 00:35:23.267
When the light returns,
remember, that minimum of

00:35:23.267 --> 00:35:27.700
temperature occurred in
perpetual darkness.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.733
At that season of the year,
it's dark over Antarctica,

00:35:30.733 --> 00:35:32.200
there's no light.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.333
So you can get the ice forming,
you can get the Cl

00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:38.500
all ready to go, but it's
in the diatomic form.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.833
Then the light comes back,
Southern Hemisphere spring,

00:35:42.833 --> 00:35:49.600
the light comes back, you can
dissociate the Cl2 to form two

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.667
Cl molecules.

00:35:51.667 --> 00:35:55.100
And then go back a few slides to
that catalytic reaction and

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.933
it starts to destroy ozone.

00:35:58.933 --> 00:35:59.633
So you get that?

00:35:59.633 --> 00:36:04.100
So the ice frees up the
chlorine, it then dissociates

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:08.067
when light returns, and the
catalytic destruction of ozone

00:36:08.067 --> 00:36:13.000
begins to take place, and the
ozone hole forms. That's why

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.200
it occurs where it does and when
it does because of that

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.533
necessary condition for cold.

00:36:21.533 --> 00:36:29.467
And then the ozone hole forms
just after the light returns

00:36:29.467 --> 00:36:30.700
to that region.

00:36:33.167 --> 00:36:33.833
Any questions on that?

00:36:33.833 --> 00:36:34.700
Yes?.

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:39.433
STUDENT: Where does the
hydrochloric acid

00:36:39.433 --> 00:36:44.767
come from, the HCl?

00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:46.100
PROFESSOR: I don't know.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.533
That's the way the chlorine is
stored most of the time in the

00:36:49.533 --> 00:36:53.167
stratosphere, is in these
two molecules.

00:36:53.167 --> 00:36:58.233
After the CFCs break down, the
chlorine is transferred into

00:36:58.233 --> 00:37:02.067
these two forms and
just hangs around.

00:37:02.067 --> 00:37:06.733
Then the PSCs form and that
sucks off the nitric acid and

00:37:06.733 --> 00:37:07.633
the Cl is released.

00:37:07.633 --> 00:37:13.133
So this is the storage form of
the chlorine during most of

00:37:13.133 --> 00:37:15.100
the year in the stratosphere.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.500
STUDENT: Is there normally
chlorine in the atmosphere

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.733
besides the HCI?

00:37:20.533 --> 00:37:21.433
PROFESSOR: Not naturally.

00:37:21.433 --> 00:37:27.233
Remember this was CFCs
and not chlorine.

00:37:27.233 --> 00:37:28.500
And that's a critical
difference.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.733
But let me just go
back to that.

00:37:31.733 --> 00:37:36.333
There were no CFCs in the
atmosphere before that.

00:37:36.333 --> 00:37:38.400
There probably was a little bit
of chlorine, but only a

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.733
very small amount.

00:37:39.733 --> 00:37:44.200
But now we're putting it in
through this CFC source.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.800
Sorry, that's not a complete
answer, but that's

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.067
the best I can do.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:55.200
So I think this-yeah, this
is the last one.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.567
So the Montreal Protocol, the
full name of it is Montreal

00:38:00.567 --> 00:38:04.500
Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone layer.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.033
It's an international treaty.

00:38:08.933 --> 00:38:11.533
And of course it was first
signed in Montreal,

00:38:11.533 --> 00:38:12.467
it's got the name.

00:38:12.467 --> 00:38:17.367
Since then it has been modified
several times.

00:38:17.367 --> 00:38:23.100
Certain forms of substances have
been added to the banned

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.400
list, others have
been allowed.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.300
So it's been modified
a few times.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.667
Generally what it did is by the
time we came to 1994, it

00:38:31.667 --> 00:38:35.367
had banned pretty much all
emissions of CFCs into the

00:38:35.367 --> 00:38:35.867
atmosphere.

00:38:35.867 --> 00:38:42.800
It largely replaced them with
the HCFC, which can also be

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:49.333
used as a refrigerant, but has
a much shorter lifetime and

00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:52.867
will not cause the chlorine to
build up in the atmosphere.

00:38:52.867 --> 00:38:55.067
It may have some other
problems, it may be a

00:38:55.067 --> 00:38:56.000
greenhouse gas.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.767
But it doesn't have the problem
of putting permanently

00:38:59.767 --> 00:39:03.200
chlorine into the atmosphere
the way that the CFCs do.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.767
Now one of the reasons why
this treaty was signed,

00:39:07.767 --> 00:39:13.167
because as you'd expect the
refrigerant industry

00:39:13.167 --> 00:39:17.800
vigorously opposed this, was
at about the time it was

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.333
signed, Dupont which was this
large chemical company and the

00:39:21.333 --> 00:39:25.700
world's largest producer
of CFCs, discovered a

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.100
replacement for it.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.800
And they realized that they
would not lose their business

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.467
because they had a replacement
ready to go and they might

00:39:34.467 --> 00:39:38.567
even be able to make more money
by doing this changeover

00:39:38.567 --> 00:39:40.967
to a different type
of refrigerant.

00:39:40.967 --> 00:39:46.700
So in the end, they dropped
their opposition and many

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.833
countries of the world got
together and signed this

00:39:48.833 --> 00:39:49.800
international treaty.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.733
And it's viewed in environmental
circles as being

00:39:52.733 --> 00:39:58.733
one of the best examples of a
successful situation where the

00:39:58.733 --> 00:40:03.333
scientists discovered the
problem, suggested how to

00:40:03.333 --> 00:40:06.067
solve it, and then you have
the countries of the world

00:40:06.067 --> 00:40:07.733
actually getting together
to pass a treaty

00:40:07.733 --> 00:40:08.833
and acting on it.

00:40:08.833 --> 00:40:14.000
As you saw, the CFC emissions
have dropped nearly to 0 now.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.933
So it's looked at as, well in
some cases, in wonderment

00:40:19.933 --> 00:40:22.333
because how could we do
something like this today,

00:40:22.333 --> 00:40:23.067
it's not clear.

00:40:23.067 --> 00:40:27.233
But at least we have this
example of how environmental

00:40:27.233 --> 00:40:31.400
science can prevent
these problems.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.633
Any questions on this?

00:40:35.167 --> 00:40:36.833
Great we're done a little
bit early again today.

00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:40.000
So enjoy your Thanksgiving break
and I'll see you a week

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.233
from Monday.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.646
Prof: Well,
I'd like to welcome the

00:00:04.646 --> 00:00:06.300
prospective students.
 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.341
I won't say the word
"Yalie"

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:12.630
prematurely,
but of course I hope you all

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.370
come.
 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.010
I wish I had a chance to
provide a little context for

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.070
what I'm going to say today,
but maybe you'll scramble into

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.870
some sense of things as we go
along.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:32.560
This lecture concerns an essay
written to immediate widespread

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.260
acclaim and controversy by two
young,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.103
at the time quite uninfluential
and untenured scholars trying to

00:00:43.103 --> 00:00:45.410
make their way in the world.
 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.090
They certainly succeeded with
this essay,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.920
which was published in
Critical Inquiry,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.413
then certainly the leading
organ for the dissemination of

00:00:56.413 --> 00:01:00.417
innovative theoretical ideas,
and they were,

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:05.700
generally speaking,
gratified by the results.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.787
Almost immediately the editors
of Critical Inquiry

00:01:08.787 --> 00:01:11.962
decided to publish,
together with "Against

00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:14.653
Theory,"
in book form a series of

00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:18.000
responses to "Against
Theory,"

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.593
all of them sort of polite,
carefully thought-through

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:27.159
responses which made a very
interesting thin book,

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.569
which is still available.
 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.697
I think it's still in print and
well worth having if you take an

00:01:34.697 --> 00:01:38.629
interest in the controversies
that the article generated,

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:40.806
and of course,
I'm hoping in the time

00:01:40.806 --> 00:01:43.890
remaining to get you to take an
interest in them.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.230
Knapp and Michaels were then,
still are,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.426
what's called
"neo-pragmatists,"

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:54.637
which is to say they are
influenced most immediately by

00:01:54.637 --> 00:01:59.626
an important book written in the
1970s by the philosopher Richard

00:01:59.626 --> 00:02:04.149
Rorty called Philosophy and
the Mirror of Nature;

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.983
but Rorty was writing in a
tradition that goes back through

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:14.128
the important work of John Dewey
in the 1930s and '40s,

00:02:14.128 --> 00:02:18.021
and before then not only to the
great philosophical

00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:22.717
interventions of William James,
Henry James's brother,

00:02:22.717 --> 00:02:28.490
but also a theory of signs
by Charles Sanders Peirce,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.711
a theory which at the time
didn't generate too much

00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:38.318
recognition or controversy.
 

00:02:38.318 --> 00:02:41.878
It was taken up by the
so-called Cambridge School of

00:02:41.878 --> 00:02:45.020
literary critics headed by
I.A. Richards.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.899
He and C.K. Ogden wrote some
reflections on Peirce's

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:52.500
semiotics,
but today with pragmatism,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.199
neo-pragmatism--
a fairly important strain in

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.560
academic theoretical and
literary thinking--

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.758
Peirce's semiotics is in a way
receiving more attention,

00:03:04.758 --> 00:03:10.164
in a way also challenging the
hegemony in the field of

00:03:10.164 --> 00:03:14.449
literary theory of Saussure's
semiotics.

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:18.802
This sense of the sign as
something different from what

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:23.801
Saussure said it was is going to
be the underlying theme of the

00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:27.348
second and central part of this
lecture.

00:03:27.348 --> 00:03:31.181
Nineteen eighty-two was
probably the high-water mark

00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:35.917
both of the fascination and the
frustration with literary theory

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:37.419
in this country.
 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.795
It was a hot-button
topic--we've gone into this

00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:43.825
before--
in ways that it is not really

00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:45.715
today,
so that our interest in

00:03:45.715 --> 00:03:48.389
literary theory is at least in
part historical,

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.680
one might want to say.
 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.160
In 1982, though,
where you stood on these

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.639
matters just made all the
difference,

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.863
and it was in that atmosphere
that Knapp and Michaels's

00:03:59.863 --> 00:04:02.430
"Against Theory"
was published.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.680
Now as I say,
they were neo-pragmatists,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.400
and what that means basically
is that one knows things,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.400
which is the same thing as to
say that one believes things,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.923
such that one acts in the world
unhesitatingly as an

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:18.959
agent.
 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.867
Everything that matters in
being human has to do with one's

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:27.940
powers of agency,
but there are no actual

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.360
foundations in what we can know
objectively for our beliefs and

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.500
actions.
 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.000
In other words,
it's a position which is called

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.803
anti-foundational or
anti-foundationalist but not a

00:04:42.803 --> 00:04:47.079
position that,
as such a position might imply,

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:52.011
somehow entails nihilism or a
kind of crippling radical

00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:53.290
skepticism.
 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.865
On the contrary,
it's a position that insists

00:04:56.865 --> 00:05:01.091
that we just do what we do,
that we are always doing,

00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:04.829
thinking, believing,
and saying something;

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:09.617
that we are always exerting an
influence as social beings in

00:05:09.617 --> 00:05:13.653
our surroundings,
and that the only thing that

00:05:13.653 --> 00:05:18.829
needn't concern us about our
powers of agency is that perhaps

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:23.862
we don't really have a full,
adequate objective account of

00:05:23.862 --> 00:05:28.641
how and why it is that we do and
say and believe and influence

00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:31.149
things in the way that we do.
 

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:36.401
That position is essentially
the position taken up in Knapp

00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:37.759
and Michaels.
 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.889
Now you saw it last time
already in the essay of Stanley

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.675
Fish--
Stanley Fish,

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:47.964
who takes it that we are
largely produced by the

00:05:47.964 --> 00:05:52.069
interpretive community to which
we belong.

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.380
You'll recall his understanding
of this community as that which

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.976
constitutes our values--
in other words,

00:05:58.976 --> 00:06:01.129
there's nothing intrinsic to
ourselves,

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.740
nothing unique in our own modes
of perception,

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.221
but rather only the ways in
which our educational

00:06:08.221 --> 00:06:12.430
circumstances bring us to
believe and understand things.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.509
This, too, is a neo-pragmatist
position.

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:20.324
Now you notice that in the
third part of the Knapp and

00:06:20.324 --> 00:06:23.636
Michaels essay,
they engage in a kind of polite

00:06:23.636 --> 00:06:25.579
disagreement with Fish.
 

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:30.000
There is an underlying,
very broad agreement with him,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.607
but remember in the third part
of the essay they're talking

00:06:33.607 --> 00:06:36.026
about the synonymity,
the identity,

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:40.208
of knowledge and belief,
and they point to a particular

00:06:40.208 --> 00:06:44.553
passage in one of Fish's
arguments where he kind of slips

00:06:44.553 --> 00:06:47.199
into the idea that,
on the one hand,

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.233
you have knowledge and then,
on the other hand,

00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:53.319
you have, in relation to that,
belief.

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.769
They say, "No, no, no, no.
 

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:57.627
You can't separate knowledge
and belief,"

00:06:57.627 --> 00:07:00.930
and just on those grounds they
disagree with Fish.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.273
Fish writes one of the
responses in the book that's

00:07:04.273 --> 00:07:07.684
then subsequently published
concerning "Against

00:07:07.684 --> 00:07:11.829
Theory," but it's a
completely friendly controversy

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:15.040
about a transitory and
superficial matter.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.552
As a matter of fact,
while I'm going to pay a lot of

00:07:18.552 --> 00:07:21.310
attention to the first two
arguments--

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.069
there are basically three
arguments in this essay--

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.360
I'm going to pay very little
attention to the third argument

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.538
in which Fish is challenged
about the relationship between

00:07:30.538 --> 00:07:34.112
knowledge and belief,
in part at least because it's

00:07:34.112 --> 00:07:37.040
an argument that belongs to
philosophy.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.168
It is the cornerstone of
Rorty's argument in

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:44.533
Philosophy and the Mirror of
Nature and perhaps not so

00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:48.608
immediately relevant to the
kinds of things that we think

00:07:48.608 --> 00:07:51.300
about in doing literary theory.
 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.584
So to turn then to what they
actually do say in relation to

00:07:56.584 --> 00:08:00.230
this movement that I'm talking
about,

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.930
you notice for example that in
tone,

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.338
their work is very similar to
that of Stanley Fish.

00:08:06.338 --> 00:08:10.730
It's a kind of a downright,
no-nonsense,

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.639
let's-get-on-with-it kind of
tone that,

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:19.000
after reading Derrida and other
writers of that kind,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.029
you're perhaps not quite ready
for.

00:08:24.029 --> 00:08:25.689
In a way it's bracing.
 

00:08:25.689 --> 00:08:30.259
It must be kind of a relief to
get this sort of no-nonsense

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:34.433
attitude toward these issues
after all the tacking and

00:08:34.433 --> 00:08:38.767
veering that we're likely to
have experienced in earlier

00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:39.870
writers.
 

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.690
In a way, the tone comes with
the territory.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.625
You take these views and in a
way, the tone seems to follow

00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:50.950
from it, because what they're
saying in effect is,

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.850
You just do what you do.
 

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.279
You think what you think.
 

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:57.298
As a literary interpreter,
you're bound to have some

00:08:57.298 --> 00:09:00.615
opinion about what you're
looking at, so just get on with

00:09:00.615 --> 00:09:01.028
it.
 

00:09:01.028 --> 00:09:04.600
Express that opinion,
that's your job of work.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:10.068
On this view and in this tone,
the only way you can go wrong

00:09:10.068 --> 00:09:15.259
is to grope around for some
theoretical justification for

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:17.298
what you're doing.
 

00:09:17.298 --> 00:09:19.200
It's just fine that you're
doing it.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.288
Don't worry about it.
 

00:09:20.288 --> 00:09:22.285
Get on with it,
but don't think,

00:09:22.285 --> 00:09:25.570
according to the argument of
Knapp and Michaels,

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.760
that you can hope to find
anything like an underlying or

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.029
broad theoretical justification
for what you're doing.

00:09:34.029 --> 00:09:37.740
Obviously, that rather
challenging and provocative

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:42.207
notion is something that lends
itself readily to the sort of

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.538
no-nonsense tone that I'm
talking about.

00:09:45.538 --> 00:09:49.379
So turning then to their
argument,

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:58.330
they argue that people become
entangled with issues of theory,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.528
all of which in their view
should be avoided,

00:10:02.528 --> 00:10:08.470
when they do two--well,
three but, as I say,

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.139
we're going to set
"knowledge and belief"

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:12.173
aside--
when they make three

00:10:12.173 --> 00:10:14.080
fundamental mistakes.
 

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.557
The first is to suppose that
there is a difference between

00:10:18.557 --> 00:10:21.778
meaning and intention:
in other words,

00:10:21.778 --> 00:10:24.446
for example,
that to know a meaning you have

00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:26.740
to be able to invoke an
intention,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.912
on the one hand,
or in the absence of an

00:10:29.912 --> 00:10:33.408
intention,
we cannot possibly speak of a

00:10:33.408 --> 00:10:35.678
meaning,
on the other hand.

00:10:35.678 --> 00:10:38.894
That's their first argument:
people become embroiled in

00:10:38.894 --> 00:10:41.870
theory when they make one of
those two mistakes.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.490
We'll come back to that in a
minute.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.856
The second argument is their
insistence that there is no such

00:10:48.856 --> 00:10:52.423
thing as a difference between
language and speech:

00:10:52.423 --> 00:10:55.841
in other words,
the Saussurian idea that we

00:10:55.841 --> 00:11:00.346
have language somehow or another
virtually present in our heads

00:11:00.346 --> 00:11:04.558
as a lexicon and a set of rules
of grammar and syntax,

00:11:04.558 --> 00:11:09.278
that language or langue
produces speech,

00:11:09.278 --> 00:11:11.360
what I say from sentence to
sentence,

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.832
or parole--this notion
is simply false because there is

00:11:15.832 --> 00:11:19.059
no difference between language
and speech.

00:11:19.059 --> 00:11:22.528
That's their second premise.
 

00:11:22.528 --> 00:11:26.764
Now before I launch into those
arguments, let me say one more

00:11:26.764 --> 00:11:29.798
thing about their attitude
toward theory.

00:11:29.798 --> 00:11:33.688
Let me call your attention to
the very first paragraph,

00:11:33.688 --> 00:11:37.288
which in your copy center
packet is on page 079.

00:11:37.288 --> 00:11:40.346
This is the very first
paragraph of "Against

00:11:40.346 --> 00:11:43.596
Theory,"
where interestingly they exempt

00:11:43.596 --> 00:11:46.590
certain ways of thinking about
literature,

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.710
certainly quasi-scientific ways
of thinking about literature,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.649
from their charge against
theory.

00:11:53.649 --> 00:11:56.067
They say:
The term ["theory"]

00:11:56.067 --> 00:11:59.438
is sometimes applied to
literary subjects with no direct

00:11:59.438 --> 00:12:02.750
bearing on the interpretation of
individual works,

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:07.769
such as narratology,
stylistics, and prosody.

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:11.542
Despite their generality,
however, these subjects seem to

00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:14.908
us essentially empirical,
and our arguments against

00:12:14.908 --> 00:12:17.200
theory will not apply to them.
 

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.197
Well, now this is a little
surprising because for one

00:12:21.197 --> 00:12:22.623
thing,
in this course,

00:12:22.623 --> 00:12:24.580
which is presumably devoted to
theory,

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.399
we've talked about some of
these things--

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.889
especially about narratology:
stylistics--

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:37.373
which is the science of style
and how one can approach style

00:12:37.373 --> 00:12:41.099
syntactically,
statistically and in the

00:12:41.099 --> 00:12:43.649
variety of ways in which that's
done--

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:48.133
and poetics,
which is general ideas about

00:12:48.133 --> 00:12:55.206
what constitutes a poem,
or a text written in some other

00:12:55.206 --> 00:12:56.120
genre.
 

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.825
All of these,
for example,

00:12:57.825 --> 00:13:01.440
must remind us very much of the
Russian formalists.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.833
Narratology,
as we studied it,

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:07.220
is largely derived from
structuralism,

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.230
indeed also from certain ideas
of Freud,

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:14.379
and all of this sounds
suspiciously like theory.

00:13:14.379 --> 00:13:16.808
What point are they making
about it?

00:13:16.808 --> 00:13:20.056
Well, simply,
the point that those ways of

00:13:20.056 --> 00:13:24.331
thinking about literature,
which they exempt from their

00:13:24.331 --> 00:13:26.548
diatribe against theory.
 

00:13:26.548 --> 00:13:29.874
are the ways that they call
"empirical,"

00:13:29.874 --> 00:13:33.265
ways of thinking about
literature that are based on

00:13:33.265 --> 00:13:35.208
observation--
and that, of course,

00:13:35.208 --> 00:13:36.604
would certainly,
it seems to me,

00:13:36.604 --> 00:13:39.432
apply to the Russian formalists
or at least to what the Russian

00:13:39.432 --> 00:13:43.346
formalists think they're doing--
ways that are empirical in the

00:13:43.346 --> 00:13:47.311
sense that they observe data,
they build up a kind of

00:13:47.311 --> 00:13:51.408
database, and they generalize
from what they have observed.

00:13:51.408 --> 00:13:56.037
They begin, in other words,
with the object in question and

00:13:56.037 --> 00:13:58.590
then draw conclusions from it.
 

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:02.570
So empirical approaches to
literature,

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.548
the simple observation of data
from which one can generalize--

00:14:06.548 --> 00:14:11.541
they exempt these from the
general charge against literary

00:14:11.541 --> 00:14:12.330
theory.
 

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:19.203
Turning then to the idea that
intention and meaning just must

00:14:19.203 --> 00:14:23.782
be the same thing,
and then subsequently the idea

00:14:23.782 --> 00:14:27.547
that language and speech just
must be the same thing:

00:14:27.547 --> 00:14:32.035
in the background I'd like you
to be thinking about some of the

00:14:32.035 --> 00:14:35.365
implications of this sentence
[points to board:

00:14:35.365 --> 00:14:38.769
"I can know the meaning of
a word,

00:14:38.769 --> 00:14:40.812
but can I know the intention of
a word?"]

00:14:40.812 --> 00:14:43.355
by Stanley Cavell which was
written in another one of the

00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:46.080
responses to this essay that was
published in the book,

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.240
Against Theory.
 

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.250
I don't want to reflect on
it now,

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:56.128
but it seems to me a strikingly
vivid way of posing a challenge

00:14:56.128 --> 00:15:02.230
to the Knapp and Michaels
position which in a variety of

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.113
ways,
if only by implication,

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:06.808
we'll be touching on.
 

00:15:06.808 --> 00:15:11.678
So what do Knapp and Michaels
do in order to convince us?--

00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:15.200
and I'm going to be going a
long way with them here,

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.677
indeed almost all the way,
even though I'm going to be

00:15:18.677 --> 00:15:22.549
taking a sharp turning toward
the end of the road which,

00:15:22.549 --> 00:15:24.548
I hope, saves theory.
 

00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:28.004
After all, it's scarcely
conscionable to stand here

00:15:28.004 --> 00:15:31.942
twenty-six times in front of you
for an hour each and then

00:15:31.942 --> 00:15:35.812
finally to confess at the end
that the thing we have been

00:15:35.812 --> 00:15:39.889
talking about should be banished
from our vocabulary.

00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:41.610
&gt;
 

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.480
Needless to say,
it's incumbent on me to save

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.850
our subject matter.
 

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.293
I will, but you're going to
have to wait a while because,

00:15:49.293 --> 00:15:52.738
as I say, I am going to be
going a long way down the road

00:15:52.738 --> 00:15:54.460
with Knapp and Michaels.
 

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.957
Knapp and Michaels say in
effect, Well,

00:15:55.957 --> 00:15:56.590
you know what?
 

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.570
The thing about the way in
which we approach any text,

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.216
any utterance,
any instance of language

00:16:03.216 --> 00:16:07.633
floating before us,
is just to take for granted

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.408
that it has an intention.
 

00:16:10.408 --> 00:16:13.856
As theorists and critics,
we worry away at the question

00:16:13.856 --> 00:16:19.528
of how we can know intention,
and all of this is a dangerous

00:16:19.528 --> 00:16:26.230
mistake because the fact is,
in everyday practice any piece

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:32.580
of language we encounter we just
assume to have an intention.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.360
All right.
 

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.264
So they give us an example in
which this assumption is tested

00:16:38.264 --> 00:16:43.249
and makes us realize what's at
stake in supposing that we know

00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:45.620
the meaning of something.
 

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.730
Ordinarily, we just
spontaneously say,

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.840
"I know what that
means,"

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.447
or if we don't know what it
means, we say,

00:16:51.447 --> 00:16:53.802
"It must mean something
even though I don't know what it

00:16:53.802 --> 00:16:54.428
means."
 

00:16:54.428 --> 00:16:59.129
That's our normal approach to a
piece of language.

00:16:59.129 --> 00:17:02.833
Then they say,
Suppose you're walking on the

00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:06.278
beach and you come across four
lines--

00:17:06.278 --> 00:17:09.692
"lines"
is already a dangerous thing to

00:17:09.692 --> 00:17:12.415
say--
four scratches in the sand that

00:17:12.415 --> 00:17:16.510
look an awful lot like the first
stanza of Wordsworth's 'A

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:20.200
Slumber Did My Spirit Seal':
A slumber did my spirit seal;

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.660
I had no human fears.
 

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.029
She seem'd a thing that could
not feel

00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:27.630
The touch of earthly years.
 

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.180
There it is on the beach just
right in front of us;

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.680
and we say, Oh,
well, somebody's come along,

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.746
some Wordsworth lover has come
along here and scratched these

00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:40.121
lines in the sand,
so that the intention of the

00:17:40.121 --> 00:17:41.930
text is unquestioned.
 

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.460
Wordsworth wrote it.
 

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:48.741
Somebody now wants to remind us
of what a wonderful stanza it

00:17:48.741 --> 00:17:50.680
is, and there it is.
 

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.892
Of course, it's very difficult
to know what it means,

00:17:53.892 --> 00:17:56.505
but at least I can ascribe
meaning to it because,

00:17:56.505 --> 00:17:58.519
no doubt, it's an intended
thing.

00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:00.509
But then what happens?
 

00:18:00.509 --> 00:18:05.720
A huge wave comes along and
leaves on the beach underneath

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.747
the first stanza the other
stanza, and this of course is

00:18:10.747 --> 00:18:12.849
highly problematic.
 

00:18:12.849 --> 00:18:17.450
There it is:
No motion has she now, no force;

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.240
She neither hears nor sees;
Roll'd round in earth's diurnal

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.423
course,
With rocks, and stones,

00:18:23.423 --> 00:18:24.190
and trees.
 

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.900
Now we are really puzzled.
 

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:31.625
Maybe, as Knapp and Michaels
say, the sea is a kind of a

00:18:31.625 --> 00:18:36.867
pantheistic being that likes to
write poetry--so the sea wrote

00:18:36.867 --> 00:18:37.470
it.
 

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:41.509
Maybe, they say later on,
there are little men in a

00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:45.144
submarine who look at their
handiwork and say,

00:18:45.144 --> 00:18:47.569
"Gee, that was great.
 

00:18:47.569 --> 00:18:48.720
Let's try that again."
 

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.332
In other words,
we can infer all sorts of

00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:56.876
authors for the stanza,
but it's much more likely that

00:18:56.876 --> 00:19:00.318
instead of saying that the sea
writes poetry,

00:19:00.318 --> 00:19:03.705
or instead of saying there are
little sort of homunculi in

00:19:03.705 --> 00:19:06.691
submarines writing poetry--
instead of saying that,

00:19:06.691 --> 00:19:08.828
it's much more likely that
we'll say,

00:19:08.828 --> 00:19:11.058
"This is an amazing
coincidence,

00:19:11.058 --> 00:19:13.880
truly amazing,
but it's just a coincidence.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.788
What else could it be?"
 

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:20.692
Knapp and Michaels's point,
which was the same point that

00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:23.480
you might make about a parrot
saying,

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.858
"My boss is a jerk,"
for example--

00:19:25.858 --> 00:19:28.339
you know the parrot doesn't
mean that.

00:19:28.339 --> 00:19:31.720
The parrot is just making words.
 

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.352
Somebody else meant it,
maybe, but that's just words

00:19:35.352 --> 00:19:36.990
for the parrot,
okay?

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.720
Or monkeys at typewriters
writing Shakespeare.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.880
We are told that given
eternity, this is a task that

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.057
could be accomplished,
always supposing somebody were

00:19:47.057 --> 00:19:49.181
there to whisk away the sheets
whenever they wrote a word

00:19:49.181 --> 00:19:50.130
&gt;
 

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:51.720
and finally put it back
together.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.210
All of these things are
possibilities,

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:59.210
but we suddenly realize that
those texts,

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:03.730
"My boss is a jerk"
and "A slumber did my

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:07.595
spirit seal,"
written by chance by whatever

00:20:07.595 --> 00:20:09.962
it is--
and already there is a sort of

00:20:09.962 --> 00:20:12.305
an intentionality entailed in
the idea of writing

00:20:12.305 --> 00:20:13.720
"by"
something--

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.690
but just left by chance,
we suddenly realize,

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:22.073
according to Knapp and
Michaels, that in that case

00:20:22.073 --> 00:20:26.009
those words are only like
language.

00:20:26.009 --> 00:20:31.410
They are not actually language
because nobody wrote them;

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.989
nothing wrote them;
no entity or being from God on

00:20:35.989 --> 00:20:37.650
down wrote them.
 

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.450
They are just there by chance.
 

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:44.751
Therefore, even though they
look like language,

00:20:44.751 --> 00:20:50.271
we suddenly realize that it
would be foolish to suppose that

00:20:50.271 --> 00:20:52.328
they have meaning.
 

00:20:52.328 --> 00:20:55.795
There is a poem that exactly
resembles this bunch of marks

00:20:55.795 --> 00:20:59.660
that we see in front of us,
and that poem has meaning,

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.348
but this bunch of marks does
not have meaning.

00:21:03.348 --> 00:21:06.608
Now I think probably most of
us--and that's why I think in a

00:21:06.608 --> 00:21:09.980
way Knapp and Michaels could
have chosen a better example--

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.303
I think probably most of us
would resist the idea that we

00:21:14.303 --> 00:21:17.160
can't interpret the bunch of
marks.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.369
They're identical to language.
 

00:21:19.369 --> 00:21:21.798
We feel free to interpret them.
 

00:21:21.798 --> 00:21:24.250
After all, nobody knows what
the poem means anyway!

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.733
It's been the subject of
critical controversy for

00:21:27.733 --> 00:21:28.460
decades.
 

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.463
That's one of the reasons Knapp
and Michaels choose it,

00:21:31.463 --> 00:21:33.690
and so okay,
there it is on the beach.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.058
I'll have my stab at it.
 

00:21:35.058 --> 00:21:37.079
It must mean something,
so here goes.

00:21:37.079 --> 00:21:40.000
And so we resist that.
 

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.496
That's why I gave you this
other example,

00:21:42.496 --> 00:21:46.365
because it seems to me that in
a way, the other example is more

00:21:46.365 --> 00:21:49.298
compelling than that of Knapp
and Michaels.

00:21:49.298 --> 00:21:52.719
[Points to handout.]
Now you see these two ladies

00:21:52.719 --> 00:21:54.500
looking up at the tree.
 

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.269
The upper--what do you call
them?

00:21:57.269 --> 00:22:00.662
What do you call it when the
branches are sawed off and

00:22:00.662 --> 00:22:03.490
eventually there's a kind of a
scar formed?

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.690
Student: A burl.
 

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:06.818
Prof: Burl?
 

00:22:06.818 --> 00:22:11.977
The upper burl certainly looks
an awful lot like Jesus,

00:22:11.977 --> 00:22:14.460
&gt;
 

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.651
and when this appeared in
Milford about fifteen years ago,

00:22:19.651 --> 00:22:25.116
not just these two ladies but
hundreds and hundreds of people

00:22:25.116 --> 00:22:27.028
visited the site.
 

00:22:27.028 --> 00:22:32.013
Now they, of course,
believed that that was on the

00:22:32.013 --> 00:22:35.269
tree because God put it there.
 

00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:38.430
Therefore, it had meaning.
 

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.509
We knew what it was.
 

00:22:40.509 --> 00:22:43.298
It was a representation of the
face of Jesus,

00:22:43.298 --> 00:22:48.798
and the feeling that one could
know what it was,

00:22:48.798 --> 00:22:51.413
interpret it,
and take it to be an actual

00:22:51.413 --> 00:22:55.140
representation of something was
therefore unquestioned.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.577
As we would all agree,
you accept the premise:

00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:01.940
God wrote it or I should say
put it there.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:06.943
He's been known to do the same
thing with toasted cheese

00:23:06.943 --> 00:23:10.220
sandwiches and tacos,
and it happens,

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.130
right?
 

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:15.190
You accept that premise and
you're all set.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.339
But suppose you say,
"No, no,

00:23:18.339 --> 00:23:19.200
no, no.
 

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.549
God didn't write that.
 

00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:21.579
God didn't put that there.
 

00:23:21.579 --> 00:23:24.410
It's just an accident."
 

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.180
Wouldn't you then say,
"Oh,

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:31.124
therefore it has no meaning,
it's not a representation of

00:23:31.124 --> 00:23:33.732
anything,
it just looks like

00:23:33.732 --> 00:23:35.400
something"?
 

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.328
In other words,
in this case--

00:23:38.328 --> 00:23:40.534
however you feel about "A
Slumber Did My Spirit

00:23:40.534 --> 00:23:42.604
Seal"--
in this case you would accept

00:23:42.604 --> 00:23:44.170
Knapp and Michaels's argument.
 

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.445
You would say,
"It really does depend on

00:23:47.445 --> 00:23:49.828
the inference of an intention.
 

00:23:49.828 --> 00:23:55.288
If I infer no intention,
I ascribe no meaning.

00:23:55.288 --> 00:23:59.828
If I infer an intention,
I ascribe meaning."

00:23:59.828 --> 00:24:03.170
So Knapp and Michaels are
simply making the same argument

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.914
about "A Slumber Did My
Spirit Seal,"

00:24:05.914 --> 00:24:08.538
and I think it's a very strong
argument.

00:24:08.538 --> 00:24:12.298
Once you realize--or once,
I should say,

00:24:12.298 --> 00:24:16.358
you accept the idea--that
meaning just is intention and

00:24:16.358 --> 00:24:20.500
think about it etymologically--
when I say "I mean,"

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.770
that precisely means "I
intend,"

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:23.269
right?
 

00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:26.430
It doesn't quite work that way
in all languages,

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.288
but it certainly works that way
in English,

00:24:29.288 --> 00:24:33.133
and it's worth remembering
to mean is "to

00:24:33.133 --> 00:24:36.551
intend" --
it makes a lot of sense to say

00:24:36.551 --> 00:24:40.586
that a meaning just is an
intention and that it's perhaps

00:24:40.586 --> 00:24:44.838
against the grain of common
sense to factor them apart,

00:24:44.838 --> 00:24:48.450
to say, "Well,
I can see this sentence and I

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.759
have a certain notion what it
might mean,

00:24:51.759 --> 00:24:55.803
but I still don't know what the
author intended to say,"

00:24:55.803 --> 00:24:59.173
which is forbidden from the
standpoint of Knapp and

00:24:59.173 --> 00:25:00.048
Michaels.
 

00:25:00.048 --> 00:25:02.400
Of course, you know what
the author intended to say.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.240
You've just ascribed meaning to
the sentence.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.674
Now mind you,
you may be wrong,

00:25:06.674 --> 00:25:11.545
but that isn't to say that your
being wrong hinges on knowing

00:25:11.545 --> 00:25:13.900
what the author intended.
 

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.964
In a certain sense,
Knapp and Michaels agree

00:25:16.964 --> 00:25:20.886
perfectly well with the New
Critics and with Foucault or

00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:24.297
whoever it might be and say,
"Well, you can never know

00:25:24.297 --> 00:25:25.390
what an author intended."
 

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.298
But that's not the point.
 

00:25:27.298 --> 00:25:32.230
The meaning of the sentence in
itself entails intention.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:37.338
If it weren't a sentence spoken
intentionally by an agent,

00:25:37.338 --> 00:25:41.192
human or otherwise,
it wouldn't have meaning

00:25:41.192 --> 00:25:44.420
because it wouldn't be language.
 

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:49.750
In a certain sense this,
then, can carry us to our

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:55.730
second argument because,
having established in their own

00:25:55.730 --> 00:26:01.712
minds satisfactorily that for
any text the meaning of the text

00:26:01.712 --> 00:26:05.440
must just be its
intention--

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.258
in other words,
to be understood as language at

00:26:09.258 --> 00:26:11.692
all,
to repeat myself once again,

00:26:11.692 --> 00:26:14.470
and to be understood as
language at all,

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:19.160
an intention needs to be
inferred.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.910
The argument here is that we
ought to be able to recognize,

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.386
supposing we succeed in
not inferring an

00:26:27.386 --> 00:26:30.452
intention,
that what we are looking at is

00:26:30.452 --> 00:26:34.077
actually not language;
it's just a simulacrum of

00:26:34.077 --> 00:26:38.183
language,
an effective copy of language

00:26:38.183 --> 00:26:39.848
like,
for example,

00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:44.076
the speech of a parrot or the
words produced by monkeys on

00:26:44.076 --> 00:26:45.930
typewriters and so on.
 

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:51.423
We should not from such
simulacra of words infer not

00:26:51.423 --> 00:26:55.410
only intention but meaning as
well.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:27:02.430
It is meaningless to speak of
marks that are not signs as

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.808
language.
 

00:27:03.808 --> 00:27:07.699
Bringing us to the notion of
"sign":

00:27:07.699 --> 00:27:11.327
for C.S. Peirce,
who actually discriminated

00:27:11.327 --> 00:27:15.650
among hundreds of different
kinds of signs,

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:20.548
all signs are
active--that is to say,

00:27:20.548 --> 00:27:23.579
they have an agency,
they have a purpose,

00:27:23.579 --> 00:27:25.528
they have a function.
 

00:27:25.528 --> 00:27:30.020
Peirce, in other words,
does not understand them in the

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.930
way that Saussure does as being
differential.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:39.702
He understands that too,
but for him the central point

00:27:39.702 --> 00:27:44.170
about a sign is the agency of
the sign.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:48.788
Now the implication of this is
clear, and it's the implication

00:27:48.788 --> 00:27:52.650
that Knapp and Michaels draw on
in this argument.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:28:00.094
Their claim is that there is no
distinction to be made between

00:28:00.094 --> 00:28:02.778
language and speech.
 

00:28:02.778 --> 00:28:07.470
Now let's just pause over their
argument.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.019
I would think the fact that as
we think about that--

00:28:11.019 --> 00:28:14.630
especially since we have been
exposed to Saussure and,

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:19.909
I hope, have come to accept the
idea that language is a virtual

00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:23.230
synchronic entity laid out in
space,

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:27.773
and speech is an actual
diachronic performance derived

00:28:27.773 --> 00:28:32.900
from language laid out in time--
since we have absorbed that and

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.680
since we just have this sort of
spontaneous belief,

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.568
if we're students of literary
theory,

00:28:38.568 --> 00:28:42.929
that there is a distinction
between language and speech:

00:28:42.929 --> 00:28:47.923
what do we do when we come face
to face with this claim of Knapp

00:28:47.923 --> 00:28:49.430
and Michaels's?
 

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:54.737
Now I think that they make
their most effective case in a

00:28:54.737 --> 00:28:55.779
footnote.
 

00:28:55.779 --> 00:28:59.819
This is the last footnote I'll
be calling your attention to

00:28:59.819 --> 00:29:02.816
this semester,
and it's, like all footnotes,

00:29:02.816 --> 00:29:06.160
perhaps the most telling thing
in the essay.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:13.557
It appears on page 084 in the
copy center packet,

00:29:13.557 --> 00:29:17.410
footnote number twelve.
 

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.828
I'm not going to read the whole
thing.

00:29:19.828 --> 00:29:24.352
I'm just going to read a single
sentence at the top their page

00:29:24.352 --> 00:29:26.816
twenty-one,
footnote twelve,

00:29:26.816 --> 00:29:29.726
in which they say,
"…

00:29:29.726 --> 00:29:31.979
[A]
dictionary is an index of

00:29:31.979 --> 00:29:35.680
frequent usages in particular
speech acts--

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.880
not a matrix of abstract,
pre-intentional

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.640
possibilities."
 

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.759
Think about that.
 

00:29:41.759 --> 00:29:46.546
Language, we suppose,
is, in addition to being a set

00:29:46.546 --> 00:29:52.365
of grammatical and syntactical
rules, also a set of definitions

00:29:52.365 --> 00:29:55.650
made available for speech acts.
 

00:29:55.650 --> 00:30:00.007
That is the assumption that a
course in literary theory

00:30:00.007 --> 00:30:01.460
provides for us.
 

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.950
Knapp and Michaels are denying
that in this footnote.

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:09.941
They are saying that dictionary
definitions are just a sum

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:13.863
total,
as it were, of words in action,

00:30:13.863 --> 00:30:19.624
that any definition is of a
word which is already a

00:30:19.624 --> 00:30:21.038
speech act.
 

00:30:21.038 --> 00:30:25.538
You go through all eighteen
definitions of a word.

00:30:25.538 --> 00:30:30.295
They're all of them embedded in
sentences, speech acts,

00:30:30.295 --> 00:30:34.962
and can be taken out of
sentences and still understood

00:30:34.962 --> 00:30:37.868
in their agency as performed.
 

00:30:37.868 --> 00:30:41.490
Any word in a dictionary,
in other words,

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:45.630
according to Knapp and
Michaels, is a word performed,

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:49.250
and the record fossilized,
as it were,

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:53.728
in the dictionary is a record
not of meaning per se but

00:30:53.728 --> 00:30:57.932
of performance,
of the way in which the word

00:30:57.932 --> 00:31:00.920
works in speech,
in history.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:07.574
A dictionary is nothing other
than a composite or a sum total

00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:09.460
of speech acts.
 

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.762
To distinguish,
therefore, between language as

00:31:13.762 --> 00:31:19.596
something which is pre-action
and speech as the implementation

00:31:19.596 --> 00:31:22.368
of language is a mistake.
 

00:31:22.368 --> 00:31:27.075
Language, even in the sense
that it's always there before

00:31:27.075 --> 00:31:30.098
us, is nevertheless always
active.

00:31:30.098 --> 00:31:36.299
It is a record of those actions
that have taken place before our

00:31:36.299 --> 00:31:38.858
own actions as speakers.
 

00:31:38.858 --> 00:31:42.739
There's no difference between
me acting through speech and

00:31:42.739 --> 00:31:46.548
language preexisting as
something which is not action.

00:31:46.548 --> 00:31:51.251
It's all continuous as an
ever-deepening,

00:31:51.251 --> 00:31:56.190
broadening, and
self-complicating record of

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:59.598
action, or speech action.
 

00:31:59.598 --> 00:32:04.256
Now this is a very interesting
idea and I think,

00:32:04.256 --> 00:32:10.298
again, it's an idea that one
might well go a long way with.

00:32:10.298 --> 00:32:12.635
I think it should be said in
defense of Saussure,

00:32:12.635 --> 00:32:15.166
by the way, that in a certain
way he anticipates this

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:15.798
position.
 

00:32:15.798 --> 00:32:19.288
Remember I told you that
although for purposes of

00:32:19.288 --> 00:32:21.873
learning,
to understand structuralism and

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:24.801
its aftermath we only
distinguish between language and

00:32:24.801 --> 00:32:26.304
speech,
langue and

00:32:26.304 --> 00:32:28.250
parole,
but in Saussure there's

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:31.336
actually a third category,
a sort of intermediate

00:32:31.336 --> 00:32:35.238
category, which he calls
langage. Langage is

00:32:35.238 --> 00:32:38.730
actually the sum total of all
known speech acts.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:43.478
If you could codify or quantify
everything that's ever been said

00:32:43.478 --> 00:32:46.720
or written, that would be
langage.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.226
You can see how it's different
from langue,

00:32:49.226 --> 00:32:52.038
which needn't necessarily ever
have been said at all.

00:32:52.038 --> 00:32:53.900
I'll be coming back to that in
a minute.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.365
Langage,
in other words,

00:32:55.365 --> 00:32:57.907
is "empirical,"
as Knapp and Michaels would

00:32:57.907 --> 00:32:58.298
say.
 

00:32:58.298 --> 00:33:02.128
It is something that,
had we enough information,

00:33:02.128 --> 00:33:06.038
we could actually codify into a
vast database.

00:33:06.038 --> 00:33:08.880
It would be the sum of all
speech acts,

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.089
and that actually,
what Saussure calls

00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:14.213
langage,
would be not unlike what Knapp

00:33:14.213 --> 00:33:17.118
and Michaels mean by
language.

00:33:17.118 --> 00:33:22.077
Saussure is aware that you can
think of the sum of speech acts

00:33:22.077 --> 00:33:25.410
in the way that Knapp and
Michaels do,

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:28.528
but he still holds out for this
other category,

00:33:28.528 --> 00:33:35.720
this notion of langue as
the code from which speech acts

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.480
are derived,
as a thing apart.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.750
Now I think,
as I say, this is a persuasive

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:47.410
position,
because after all,

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:51.009
as long as we suppose that
language exists for

00:33:51.009 --> 00:33:54.935
communication,
that it is interactive--as long

00:33:54.935 --> 00:33:57.449
as we accept,
as we have accepted from

00:33:57.449 --> 00:34:00.338
Bakhtin and others during the
course of the course--

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:05.863
the idea that language is
social, that all of its

00:34:05.863 --> 00:34:12.661
deployments are interactive,
derived from the speech acts of

00:34:12.661 --> 00:34:15.489
others,
appropriated for oneself as

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:19.275
one's own set of speech acts,
and influential on yet other

00:34:19.275 --> 00:34:22.246
people as a speech act--
as long as we accept this,

00:34:22.246 --> 00:34:25.344
we say to ourselves,
"Yeah, it makes a lot of

00:34:25.344 --> 00:34:28.829
sense to think of language as
inseparable from speech,

00:34:28.829 --> 00:34:34.063
to think of language simply as
the sum of all agencies so that

00:34:34.063 --> 00:34:38.952
no meaningful distinction
between that sum of agencies and

00:34:38.952 --> 00:34:43.070
the individual agency of a
speech act needs to be

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.530
made."
 

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.400
Notice though--and here,
by the way,

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.559
is where I'm going to make my
turn and save theory,

00:34:50.559 --> 00:34:55.523
so sharpen your
pencils!--notice that I began

00:34:55.523 --> 00:35:01.275
that last riff by saying
"as long as we suppose

00:35:01.275 --> 00:35:06.239
language exists for
communication."

00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:09.606
Now we do suppose
language exists for

00:35:09.606 --> 00:35:10.860
communication.
 

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.570
What else could it exist for?
 

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:15.070
What do we do with language
except to communicate?

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.929
You could say,
"Well, we write doodles.

00:35:17.929 --> 00:35:20.099
We make meaningless marks in
the sand."

00:35:20.099 --> 00:35:23.117
There are all kinds of things
that maybe we do with language,

00:35:23.117 --> 00:35:24.980
but let's face it:
we don't, right?

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.641
If I do, in fact,
make marks in the sand

00:35:27.641 --> 00:35:31.260
amounting to "A Slumber Did
My Spirit Seal,"

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.938
it's because I love Wordsworth,
as by the way I do,

00:35:34.938 --> 00:35:38.920
and I wish to communicate that
love to the rest of the world.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.400
It's a speech act.
 

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.130
Come on, I'm not just making
marks.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:45.755
If I wanted to make marks,
I'd do something rather more

00:35:45.755 --> 00:35:47.570
mark-like [gesticulates].
 

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.840
Well, so
&gt;

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.846
in any case,
we certainly inhabit a life

00:35:53.846 --> 00:35:59.907
world in which it is almost
inconceivable for anyone to come

00:35:59.907 --> 00:36:04.047
along and tell us,
"Language is not for the

00:36:04.047 --> 00:36:06.010
purpose of communication."
 

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:07.909
In other words,
Knapp and Michaels seem to be

00:36:07.909 --> 00:36:08.730
completely right.
 

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.260
What else is it for?
 

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.980
That's what we use it for.
 

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:18.255
We have refined it to a
fare-thee-well as an efficient,

00:36:18.255 --> 00:36:22.360
flexible, sometimes even
eloquent medium of

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.119
communication.
 

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:27.130
That's what language is for,
that's what it exists for.

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:30.250
As I'm saying,
if we accept this idea--

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.670
which seems simply to carry the
day,

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.400
because who could think
anything else?--

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.416
if we accept this idea,
then there's a very strong case

00:36:38.416 --> 00:36:41.170
for Knapp and Michaels being
right.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:45.420
Really there's no significant
or important difference between

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.980
language and speech.
 

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.771
But now suppose we approach the
question from a--I don't say

00:36:51.771 --> 00:36:56.320
from an empirical point of view
&gt;

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.920
but from a speculative
anthropological point of view.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.940
Suppose we approach it with
some rather commonsense remarks.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.329
Now we say language is for
communication;

00:37:09.329 --> 00:37:13.269
the purpose of language is for
communication.

00:37:13.269 --> 00:37:16.719
We say that.
 

00:37:16.719 --> 00:37:22.016
Especially if we think of the
whole history of mankind,

00:37:22.016 --> 00:37:27.610
does that mean that the purpose
of fire is for cooking?

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:31.293
Or to bring it a little bit
closer to home,

00:37:31.293 --> 00:37:36.469
does it mean that the purpose
of the prehensile thumb is for

00:37:36.469 --> 00:37:37.610
grasping?
 

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:43.425
Does it mean that the purpose
of a cave, a hole in the rock,

00:37:43.425 --> 00:37:45.199
is for dwelling?
 

00:37:45.199 --> 00:37:47.329
No.
 

00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:51.942
In those cases,
adaptation is what makes fire a

00:37:51.942 --> 00:37:56.512
good thing to cook with,
the prehensile thumb a good

00:37:56.512 --> 00:38:00.833
thing to grasp with,
and a cave a good thing to take

00:38:00.833 --> 00:38:04.788
shelter in,
but they all in their various

00:38:04.788 --> 00:38:06.800
ways are just there.
 

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.039
Plainly, all of them have
other, well,

00:38:10.039 --> 00:38:12.018
not "purposes,"
because a purpose is,

00:38:12.018 --> 00:38:14.518
when you think about it,
only something that we can

00:38:14.518 --> 00:38:17.903
impose on something;
but they certainly are not

00:38:17.903 --> 00:38:23.001
there in any sense for us to do
the thing that it turns out

00:38:23.001 --> 00:38:27.219
we've decided it's a good idea
to do with it.

00:38:27.219 --> 00:38:32.579
Fire burns us but we can cook
with it, and so on.

00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:38.994
Now in the case of language,
we have to suppose as a matter

00:38:38.994 --> 00:38:43.945
of fact that language,
as it were, appeared among us

00:38:43.945 --> 00:38:47.489
in the same way that the
prehensile thumb did.

00:38:47.489 --> 00:38:51.706
Of course we "discovered
its use,"

00:38:51.706 --> 00:38:55.139
but that's a funny way to put
it.

00:38:55.139 --> 00:39:01.885
It might be more circumspect to
say that we discovered it had a

00:39:01.885 --> 00:39:06.130
use for us which was to
communicate,

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.199
and so once we were able to put
this--

00:39:10.199 --> 00:39:13.293
whatever it was,
this weird capacity to make

00:39:13.293 --> 00:39:17.918
differential sounds--
once we put this weird capacity

00:39:17.918 --> 00:39:21.559
to make differential sounds to
work,

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:28.630
henceforth for us and for our
purposes language was there to

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.309
communicate.
 

00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:33.260
Of course we made an enormous
success of it,

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:37.320
or a tower of Babel of it,
whichever you prefer to think,

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.280
but in any case we have it,
and it has developed among us

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.000
as a means of a medium of
communication.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:53.510
But by whatever mutancy
language arose,

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:56.447
supposing this to be the
case--and I'm not making an

00:39:56.447 --> 00:39:59.557
argument that has anything to do
with "intelligent

00:39:59.557 --> 00:40:01.690
design" one way or
another--

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:07.190
supposing that by whatever
mutancy language appeared,

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:10.141
then, of course,
the next day there were an

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:14.217
avalanche: then it might well be
the case that this species

00:40:14.217 --> 00:40:18.503
consisting of all of us sitting
in this room and I guess a few

00:40:18.503 --> 00:40:21.590
other people,
&gt;

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:24.889
that this species might be mute.
 

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:29.606
It might be communicating
perhaps with incredible

00:40:29.606 --> 00:40:33.931
eloquence, perhaps even with
literary genius,

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:37.469
by means of signs or--who
knows?

00:40:37.469 --> 00:40:41.445
Or for that matter it might
have taken a detour in its

00:40:41.445 --> 00:40:45.273
development such that
communication was not anything

00:40:45.273 --> 00:40:48.650
one could identify as
specifically human.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:52.655
All sentient beings
communicate, but it's possible

00:40:52.655 --> 00:40:57.398
that this particular species
could have taken a turn in its

00:40:57.398 --> 00:41:01.813
development after which
communication was much as it is

00:41:01.813 --> 00:41:04.840
among mice or ants or whatever.
 

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.498
All of this is possible,
you see, when we think about

00:41:09.498 --> 00:41:14.065
language--a property that we
have and manipulate and

00:41:14.065 --> 00:41:17.650
communicate
with--anthropologically.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:22.369
It comes into being in such a
way that it is,

00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:26.981
I would think,
scarcely relevant to say that

00:41:26.981 --> 00:41:30.949
its purpose is for
communication.

00:41:30.949 --> 00:41:34.409
It comes into being simply as
an attribute,

00:41:34.409 --> 00:41:38.869
a property, something we happen
to have,

00:41:38.869 --> 00:41:43.902
something someone happens to
have for which a use is then

00:41:43.902 --> 00:41:46.498
discovered,
as for fire,

00:41:46.498 --> 00:41:51.300
for the prehensile thumb and
for the cave.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.349
The relationship between the
cave and the house,

00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:56.255
it seems to me,
is a particularly interesting

00:41:56.255 --> 00:42:00.018
way of thinking about the
relationship between language as

00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:03.320
a set of differentials and
language as speech.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.925
Notice something about the
signs of language--and here of

00:42:06.925 --> 00:42:09.050
course we also invoke Saussure.
 

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:14.088
Saussure lays every stress on
the idea that language is made

00:42:14.088 --> 00:42:17.590
up of differential and arbitrary
signs.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.902
In other words,
Saussure denies that there is

00:42:20.902 --> 00:42:24.289
such a thing in language as a
natural sign.

00:42:24.289 --> 00:42:27.039
The Russian formalists do this
as well.

00:42:27.039 --> 00:42:31.775
Both Saussure and the Russian
formalists warn us against

00:42:31.775 --> 00:42:35.219
believing that onomatopoetic
devices--

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.721
for example,
"peep, peep,

00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:40.467
peep"--devices like that,
are actually natural signs,

00:42:40.467 --> 00:42:43.400
that they are derived,
in other words,

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.507
from the thing in the world
that they seem through their

00:42:47.507 --> 00:42:49.150
sound to represent.
 

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:53.548
Saussure reminds us that these
are accidents of etymological

00:42:53.548 --> 00:42:57.800
history which can also be
understood in adaptive terms.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.833
Onomatopoeia exists in language
because it's good for

00:43:00.833 --> 00:43:03.750
communication and it's fun to
communicate with,

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:07.469
but it doesn't enter language
as a natural sign.

00:43:07.469 --> 00:43:11.960
It only passes through
moments--in the evolution of a

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.048
given word--
it only passes through moments

00:43:15.048 --> 00:43:18.556
in which the relationship
between the sound and the thing

00:43:18.556 --> 00:43:20.750
represented seems to be natural.
 

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:25.338
This is a matter upon which
great stress is laid both in

00:43:25.338 --> 00:43:28.760
Saussure and in the Russian
formalists.

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:33.242
When you read these passages in
which such stress is laid on it

00:43:33.242 --> 00:43:36.570
you may have thought:
well, that's overkill.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:39.309
Who cares about onomatopoeia?
 

00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:44.163
Well, it anchors the entire
idea about language,

00:43:44.163 --> 00:43:50.360
which is precisely that it is
something other than speech.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.443
When we speak,
we not only endeavor to

00:43:54.443 --> 00:43:57.909
communicate;
we endeavor to refer.

00:43:57.909 --> 00:44:01.005
In other words,
we take language and we try to

00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:04.791
make it, as the philosophers
say, hook on to the natural

00:44:04.791 --> 00:44:05.480
world.
 

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:10.150
We take a set of signs,
a code which is not in itself

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:12.735
natural,
which is arbitrary,

00:44:12.735 --> 00:44:15.929
and through the sheer force of
will,

00:44:15.929 --> 00:44:20.789
we make those signs as best we
can hook on to the natural,

00:44:20.789 --> 00:44:22.289
to the actual world.
 

00:44:22.289 --> 00:44:25.664
In doing so,
we reinforce the idea that

00:44:25.664 --> 00:44:29.838
language is for
communication--whereas my

00:44:29.838 --> 00:44:34.190
argument is language isn't for
communication;

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:36.400
speech is.
 

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.309
When we speak,
that is--entirely and

00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:42.969
exclusively and without any
other motive--

00:44:42.969 --> 00:44:46.329
for communication,
except for one thing that the

00:44:46.329 --> 00:44:49.760
Russian formalists in particular
took note of.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.699
There are funny things going on
in our speech--

00:44:53.699 --> 00:44:58.074
alliteration,
unnecessary or uneconomical

00:44:58.074 --> 00:45:02.621
forms of repetition--
weird things going on in our

00:45:02.621 --> 00:45:07.119
speech which don't seem to have
the purpose of communication.

00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:09.849
As a matter of fact,
they actually seem to impede

00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:10.760
communication.
 

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.139
When I really start messing
language up--

00:45:15.139 --> 00:45:17.458
for example,
in Lewis Carroll's "'Twas

00:45:17.458 --> 00:45:20.606
brillig, and the slithy toves /
did gyre and gimble in the

00:45:20.606 --> 00:45:23.974
wabe"--
I am impeding communication

00:45:23.974 --> 00:45:28.670
because I am laying stress on
elements of rhythm,

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:33.722
pattern, and sound recurrence
which cannot be said to have any

00:45:33.722 --> 00:45:36.539
direct bearing on communication.
 

00:45:36.539 --> 00:45:38.284
This, of course,
is what we've studied

00:45:38.284 --> 00:45:39.697
recurrently and,
I have to say,

00:45:39.697 --> 00:45:41.489
empirically
&gt;

00:45:41.489 --> 00:45:44.820
because these are all empirical
facts about language,

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.190
as the Russian formalists
insisted.

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:52.070
What we have studied
recurrently is the way in which

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:56.090
language rears its ugly head in
speech,

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:59.853
the way in which,
in other words,

00:45:59.853 --> 00:46:06.090
language won't be repressed as
mere communication,

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:10.992
the way in which speech entails
elements that keep bubbling up

00:46:10.992 --> 00:46:14.449
to the surface and asserting
themselves,

00:46:14.449 --> 00:46:19.893
which oddly enough really can't
be said to conduce to

00:46:19.893 --> 00:46:21.570
communication.
 

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:24.692
Those things,
those elements that bubble up

00:46:24.692 --> 00:46:29.820
to the surface,
are nothing other than evidence

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:36.807
of the presence of language,
precisely in the way that in

00:46:36.807 --> 00:46:41.239
Freud the Freudian slip--
the fact that I can't get

00:46:41.239 --> 00:46:44.320
through a sentence without
making some kind of blunder,

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.469
very often an embarrassing
blunder--

00:46:49.469 --> 00:46:55.844
is understood as the bubbling
up into the conscious effort to

00:46:55.844 --> 00:47:00.518
speak of that which speech can't
control,

00:47:00.518 --> 00:47:05.023
of that which Freud calls
"the unconscious"

00:47:05.023 --> 00:47:08.719
and which,
by the way, we would have no

00:47:08.719 --> 00:47:14.409
idea of the existence of if it
weren't for the Freudian slip.

00:47:14.409 --> 00:47:16.943
In other words,
as Freud said in the first

00:47:16.943 --> 00:47:20.650
handout that I gave you at the
beginning of the semester,

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:26.844
we infer the unconscious from
the behavior of consciousness

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:30.041
because,
given the erratic nature of the

00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:35.018
behavior of consciousness,
it seems necessary to do so.

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:38.369
By precisely the same token,
we can and,

00:47:38.369 --> 00:47:41.914
I think we should say,
we do infer language as

00:47:41.914 --> 00:47:46.800
something else from the
composite or sum total of speech

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.510
acts.
 

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:52.855
We infer language from the
erratic behavior of speech

00:47:52.855 --> 00:47:58.612
because it seems there is no
other way to account for the

00:47:58.612 --> 00:48:01.800
erratic behavior of speech.
 

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:06.634
That sense of language,
which I'm going to be talking a

00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:11.887
lot more about on Thursday,
sort of bubbling up and from

00:48:11.887 --> 00:48:15.744
below in speech,
and proving its existence as

00:48:15.744 --> 00:48:20.309
something other than a composite
record of all speeches,

00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:24.251
is what suggests to us that
Knapp and Michaels are not quite

00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:28.327
right in saying there is really
no difference between language

00:48:28.327 --> 00:48:31.054
and speech;
that if there is a difference

00:48:31.054 --> 00:48:34.025
between language and speech,
as I am claiming,

00:48:34.025 --> 00:48:38.141
and if the difference between
language and speech is much as

00:48:38.141 --> 00:48:41.840
we have been taught to think of
it by Saussure and his

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.980
successors down through
deconstruction--

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.940
if there is such a difference,
then guess what?

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.949
We have literary theory back in
the fold,

00:48:50.949 --> 00:48:53.592
alive and well,
and we no longer have to say

00:48:53.592 --> 00:48:56.726
that it should be jettisoned
from our thinking about

00:48:56.726 --> 00:48:57.650
literature.
 

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:00.800
We have a real use for literary
theory.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.039
But that's exactly where Knapp
and Michaels,

00:49:03.039 --> 00:49:06.114
supposing they were here and
I'd convinced them--by the way,

00:49:06.114 --> 00:49:07.210
I know them both.
 

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:09.592
You can't convince them of
anything, but that's not

00:49:09.592 --> 00:49:10.070
unusual.
 

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:14.139
You probably can't convince me
of anything either--suppose we

00:49:14.139 --> 00:49:17.869
had them here and I had
succeeded in convincing them.

00:49:17.869 --> 00:49:19.907
They would say,
"Well, okay,

00:49:19.907 --> 00:49:21.309
but isn't it a pity?
 

00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:26.960
Because you have proved better
than we did that literary theory

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.510
has no purpose.
 

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:32.514
Why on earth should we worry
about all this bubbling up of

00:49:32.514 --> 00:49:36.030
stuff that has nothing to do
with communication?

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:38.239
After all, we're here to
communicate, aren't we?

00:49:38.239 --> 00:49:41.789
We've begun by saying that our
life world consists precisely in

00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:44.539
the deployment of language for
communication,

00:49:44.539 --> 00:49:47.570
and here is this person saying
there is this stuff bubbling up,

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:51.159
which makes communication
difficult.

00:49:51.159 --> 00:49:53.550
What use is that?"
 

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.440
Knapp and Michaels might say.
 

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.070
You see, they are pragmatists,
aren't they?

00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:02.306
They are pragmatists,
or they are concerned with

00:50:02.306 --> 00:50:03.659
practicality.
 

00:50:03.659 --> 00:50:06.472
Their interest,
their reason for being

00:50:06.472 --> 00:50:09.820
interested in meaning and
interpretation,

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:16.121
is a practical reason entirely
entailed in the understanding of

00:50:16.121 --> 00:50:21.510
communication and the
furtherance of communication;

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:25.210
whereas theory,
which I have saved,

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:29.632
I nevertheless seem to have
saved at a pretty considerable

00:50:29.632 --> 00:50:34.367
cost because I have suggested
that theory itself is completely

00:50:34.367 --> 00:50:35.610
impractical.
 

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:38.371
I have suggested it,
and we're going to get back to

00:50:38.371 --> 00:50:39.309
that next time.
 

00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:42.090
That's what the Thursday
lecture is going to be about.

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:45.023
In the meantime you say to
yourself, "Okay,

00:50:45.023 --> 00:50:45.460
fine.
 

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.467
We've got theory,
but we have also been shown

00:50:47.467 --> 00:50:49.518
that you can't really do
anything with it,

00:50:49.518 --> 00:50:54.161
and so it might just as well
suit us to suppose that Knapp

00:50:54.161 --> 00:50:58.965
and Michaels are right and to
proceed as though theory could

00:50:58.965 --> 00:51:00.920
be jettisoned."
 

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.420
One last quick point,
going back to the distinction

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:08.059
between meaning and intention:
notice the two-pronged

00:51:08.059 --> 00:51:08.969
argument.
 

00:51:08.969 --> 00:51:11.106
On the one hand,
there are people like

00:51:11.106 --> 00:51:14.226
E.D. Hirsch who believe that
you can invoke an author's

00:51:14.226 --> 00:51:17.000
intention in order to pin down a
meaning--

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.039
on the one hand,
you have people like that and,

00:51:20.039 --> 00:51:22.380
on the other hand,
you have people doing

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.559
deconstruction who say that
because there is no

00:51:25.559 --> 00:51:28.652
inferable intention,
texts themselves have no

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:29.250
meaning.
 

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:31.474
But that's not quite
right,

00:51:31.474 --> 00:51:35.050
because that's not really what
deconstruction says.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:38.320
Deconstruction doesn't say
texts have no meaning.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:42.585
Deconstruction doesn't even say
that you can't know what the

00:51:42.585 --> 00:51:44.900
meaning of a text is,
exactly.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:48.918
What deconstruction says is
that you can't rope off

00:51:48.918 --> 00:51:50.329
meaning in a text.
 

00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:53.480
Texts have too much meaning.
 

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.199
Texts explode with meaning.
 

00:51:56.199 --> 00:52:01.559
You can't corral the way in
which texts produce meaning.

00:52:01.559 --> 00:52:04.829
You can't corral it by
inferring an intention.

00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:09.300
You can't corral it by taking a
particular interpretive path.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.570
Meaning just explodes in texts.
 

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:16.420
That's not at all the same
thing as to say,

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:19.440
according to the claim of Knapp
and Michaels,

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:23.230
that in deconstructive thinking
texts have no meaning--

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:26.010
a very, very different
proposition altogether.

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:29.902
I think it might suggest to you
that the relationship between

00:52:29.902 --> 00:52:33.277
intention and meaning isn't
really what's at stake in

00:52:33.277 --> 00:52:34.510
deconstruction.
 

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:38.309
A text is intended,
or you can say,

00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:41.590
"Well, it may be intended,
no doubt it's intended"--

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:43.914
all sorts of ways of putting
it, but is that really the

00:52:43.914 --> 00:52:44.260
point?
 

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:47.710
The text is the text on
my view, and the text,

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:50.565
just as I say,
fairly bristles with meaning,

00:52:50.565 --> 00:52:52.889
that being precisely the point.
 

00:52:52.889 --> 00:52:54.650
You can't rein it in.
 

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:58.798
That's not really the flip
side--as Knapp and Michaels

00:52:58.798 --> 00:53:02.793
would want to make you
think–that's not really

00:53:02.793 --> 00:53:07.411
the flip side of the idea of the
followers of Hirsch that in

00:53:07.411 --> 00:53:11.615
order to know a meaning,
you have to be able to infer an

00:53:11.615 --> 00:53:12.820
authorial intention.
 

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.429
There is no symmetry
there and,

00:53:15.429 --> 00:53:17.980
as I say, I'm not sure that
deconstruction,

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.342
whatever its claims,
whatever its perfections and

00:53:20.342 --> 00:53:22.744
imperfections--
I am not sure that really

00:53:22.744 --> 00:53:26.373
deconstruction has the question
of intention in relation to

00:53:26.373 --> 00:53:29.440
meaning very much at heart one
way or another.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.530
Sorry to have kept you.
 

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:31.579
We'll see you Thursday.

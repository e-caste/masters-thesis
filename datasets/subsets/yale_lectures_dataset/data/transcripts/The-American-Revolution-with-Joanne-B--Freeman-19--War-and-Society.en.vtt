00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.262
Prof: I now actually
want to move on to the topic of

00:00:05.262 --> 00:00:09.296
the real lecture today,
and I've titled the lecture

00:00:09.296 --> 00:00:11.870
"War and Society."
 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.270
And I mentioned on Tuesday's
lecture--

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.831
at the very end of it--I
mentioned that although the

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.882
Treaty of Paris formally ended
the fighting of the American

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:25.578
Revolution,
that there were a lot of things

00:00:25.578 --> 00:00:29.350
obviously,
clearly undecided at that point.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.708
And I mentioned two things
which are very logical things to

00:00:31.708 --> 00:00:32.400
have mentioned.
 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.872
I said that,
who knew what kind of a society

00:00:34.872 --> 00:00:37.000
this new nation was going to
have,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.322
and who knew what kind of
government was going to be

00:00:41.322 --> 00:00:44.120
governing over this new nation.
 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.220
And in a way the remaining
lectures in this course--

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.392
And it's kind of shocking that
there actually aren't all that

00:00:51.392 --> 00:00:53.604
many left--
I think they're all done by

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:55.750
Powder House Day as a matter of
fact.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.111
But in a way,
the remaining lectures are

00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:02.298
going to be talking about
society,

00:01:02.298 --> 00:01:05.188
what kind of society would
emerge from the Revolution,

00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:08.718
and what kind of government
would govern over that society.

00:01:08.718 --> 00:01:11.680
So those two questions are
actually the very two questions

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.899
that are in one way or another
going to be thematically linking

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.599
together the rest of the
lectures in the course.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:20.358
And in a way,
those two questions relate back

00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:24.060
to some of what I talked about
at the very beginning of this

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.750
course.
 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.650
Hopefully, you remember.
 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.464
If you don't,
I guess you can go look at the

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:30.110
syllabus, but hopefully you
remember.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.658
I mentioned--I read quotes from
John Adams and from Benjamin

00:01:33.658 --> 00:01:37.025
Rush, both of them trying to
define what they thought the

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:38.709
American Revolution was.
 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:40.349
Right? Was it the fighting?
 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:41.879
Was it before the fighting?
 

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.650
Was it after the fighting?
 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.004
And in a way,
the next lectures,

00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:49.801
today and those to come,
are going to address those

00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:52.459
questions in a variety of ways.
 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.629
So today we're going to be
talking about society;

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:59.980
what kind of society was
America going to have in this

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.688
experimental,
brand new nation?

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:08.729
Now there are any number of
ways to discuss this question,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.076
and the approach that I'm going
to take today is to look at some

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:16.459
specific parts of American
society and see how the

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.014
Revolution affected them,
to see how things looked for

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:22.508
them--these parts of the
American population--

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:24.860
how things looked for them in
the wake of the Revolution,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.436
because in one way or another
these populations all had a

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:31.628
vital impact on the fighting of
the Revolution,

00:02:31.628 --> 00:02:36.000
and in one way or another they
were all dispossessed of power.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.126
So today we're going to look at
how the Revolution affected

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:43.026
African Americans,
women, and Native

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:47.247
Americans--and in a sense
looking at how these three

00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:50.970
populations fared in a
Revolution dedicated to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.018
defending rights and liberties
is a way of judging how radical

00:02:56.018 --> 00:02:58.169
the Revolution was.
 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:02.090
Now this is certainly what some
historians have argued,

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.513
and in particular there was a
really interesting debate on

00:03:05.513 --> 00:03:08.996
this topic that broke out in the
wake of the publication of

00:03:08.996 --> 00:03:12.598
Gordon Wood's Radicalism of
the American Revolution,

00:03:12.598 --> 00:03:15.150
and I'm sure--I don't think
it's next week--

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.018
I think maybe it's the week
after when you read the final

00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:18.938
section of Wood.
 

00:03:18.938 --> 00:03:21.492
And I'm sure that in that
discussion section when you get

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:25.169
to the final chunk of that book,
this conversation will probably

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.860
come up based on some of what
I'm talking about today.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.782
But when that book first came
out, a number of historians

00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:35.795
stepped forward and said:
No--basically--no,

00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:38.878
the Revolution was not all that
radical.

00:03:38.878 --> 00:03:41.724
And they argued that:
well, okay, Professor Wood,

00:03:41.724 --> 00:03:43.860
of course you consider it
radical.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.240
You don't really talk about
slavery.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.280
You don't talk very much about
women.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.120
And you really don't talk about
the South very much;

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.940
you focus largely on the North.
 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.235
So these historians said:
Well, when you look at the

00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:56.818
Revolution that way it looks
radical,

00:03:56.818 --> 00:03:58.870
but what about when you include
slavery,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.060
women and the South?
 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.188
How does the Revolution look
then?

00:04:03.188 --> 00:04:07.098
Well, this debate ended up
being put into print in one of

00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:10.520
the leading academic journals of
early America.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.693
It's called The William and
Mary Quarterly and they

00:04:13.693 --> 00:04:15.810
actually published the whole
debate.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.452
So they published three or four
scholars arguing that the

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:23.680
Revolution was not radical in
the way that Wood's book states,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.379
and then they let Wood have a
comeback,

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:28.853
and so they have his reply to
the historians who just refuted

00:04:28.853 --> 00:04:29.490
his book.
 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.680
It's a really interesting
conversation.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.079
And the commentators brought up
the issues that I've just named.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:37.259
Right? What about slavery?
 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.560
What about the role of women in
society?

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.660
What about the South?
 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.860
And here is a sample sentence
from Wood's response.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.555
He wrote that it is,
quote,

00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:49.230
"inconceivable,"
apparently,

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.156
to his critics,
quote, "that any white

00:04:52.156 --> 00:04:54.810
males in the past,
unless they were sailors ...

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.408
or very poor,
could ever have been oppressed

00:04:57.408 --> 00:04:58.920
or have felt oppressed.
 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.872
They imply that only those who
are oppressed or marginalized in

00:05:01.872 --> 00:05:04.588
our own time were capable of
being oppressed two centuries

00:05:04.588 --> 00:05:04.970
ago.
 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.057
If the Revolution did not
totally abolish slavery and

00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:10.738
fundamental--
fundamentally change the lot of

00:05:10.738 --> 00:05:13.204
women,
then it could not possibly have

00:05:13.204 --> 00:05:14.500
been radical."
 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.346
So clearly he's refuting them,
saying: Well,

00:05:17.346 --> 00:05:21.120
hey, can't white males also
have been oppressed and have a

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.379
radical change?
 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.192
This debate is really
interesting in part because it

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:26.240
gets very heated.
 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.240
You can really see the passions
of all the historians involved,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.500
Professor Wood included.
 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.839
They're very engaged in this.
 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:33.660
They have a lot at stake.
 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.108
You can kind of see how
passionate historical debates

00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:38.699
and arguments can get.
 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.011
But obviously,
also part of why they're get

00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:46.033
all heated is because the
Revolution in many ways is

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:48.319
America's defining event.
 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:51.968
So it sort of--it matters for
us to think about what it means,

00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:54.360
what it meant,
what it meant to different

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.019
people.
 

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:57.410
What did the Revolution really
mean?

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.658
And the debate over Wood's book
touches on these kinds of

00:06:01.658 --> 00:06:02.569
questions.
 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:06.153
Now one small part of the
problem in grappling with this

00:06:06.153 --> 00:06:10.129
question is a natural desire I
think that many of us have--

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.420
and actually people even did
this in the eighteenth century--

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.100
and that is to compare the
American Revolution and the

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.490
French Revolution.
 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.800
Right?
 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.300
People did that at the time.
 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.730
Sometimes people do that today.
 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.360
So if you're thinking about:
well,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.589
was the American Revolution
radical,

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:27.079
some people say:
Well, compared with France it

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:29.180
wasn't very radical at all,
was it?

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.889
Look at what they were doing
over there in France.

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.949
And certainly when you compare
what happened here with some of

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.100
the more radical,
extreme guillotine-based things

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.050
that were happening in France,
it might look less radical here.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.492
And in comparison with the
really deep-seated changes in

00:06:46.492 --> 00:06:49.055
French society,
like the ousting of an

00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:52.713
established aristocracy and the
killing of a king and the

00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:55.129
initiation of a new social
order--

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:57.660
right?--that's big,
big, big change.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.071
In comparison with that,
you might argue that changes in

00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:03.180
America seem tame in comparison.
 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.060
Some might argue that the
American Revolution,

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.166
unlike its French counterpart,
was essentially a political

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:14.410
protest against a distant
central government's

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.228
interference in the local
affairs of a people who were

00:07:18.228 --> 00:07:21.399
long accustomed to govern
themselves--

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:24.026
basically that the American
Revolution was not a social

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:24.660
revolution.
 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.528
I'm not necessarily defending
this argument--

00:07:26.528 --> 00:07:28.303
and as you'll see I'm not
necessarily defending any

00:07:28.303 --> 00:07:30.201
argument--
but I'm certainly stating here

00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:32.850
a number of different things
that people have argued.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.220
And actually what I'm going to
try to do today--

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.740
I'm going to discuss these
populations that are at the

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.406
heart of this debate about the
radicalism of the American

00:07:42.406 --> 00:07:43.120
Revolution.
 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.259
I'm going to talk about African
Americans,

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:48.300
women, and Native Americans and
how they fared,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.983
how the Revolution affected
them and how they experienced

00:07:50.983 --> 00:07:51.800
the Revolution.
 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.435
And part of the aim of this is
going to be that learning how

00:07:55.435 --> 00:07:58.947
these populations fared will
give us some insight into the

00:07:58.947 --> 00:08:01.966
formation of American society in
revolutionary and

00:08:01.966 --> 00:08:04.000
post-revolutionary America.
 

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.553
But what I'm going to really
try to do as I talk about this

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:10.110
today is,
I'm going to try really hard

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.014
not to answer that question I
raised about was the Revolution

00:08:14.014 --> 00:08:16.173
radical or not--
the debate that I mentioned in

00:08:16.173 --> 00:08:17.250
The William and Mary
Quarterly.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.639
I'm actually not going to weigh
in on what these changes mean,

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.370
and I'm not going to do that
very deliberately,

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.110
because the section after next
when you discuss this,

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.560
I really want you to debate it.
 

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.019
I'm not going to tell you my
opinion.

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:30.360
It might leak in.
 

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.110
I hope not.
 

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.820
I've tried really hard to
banish it.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.490
I don't want you to have my
opinion.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.774
I want you to really debate
this when you're reading the

00:08:36.774 --> 00:08:39.273
last chunk of Wood's book,
and thinking back over the

00:08:39.273 --> 00:08:41.808
course, thinking back over
lectures and readings,

00:08:41.808 --> 00:08:44.496
think to yourselves--what
do you think about the

00:08:44.496 --> 00:08:46.038
radicalism of the Revolution.
 

00:08:46.038 --> 00:08:49.100
And so the lecture today and
what I'm talking about today is

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.158
going to be fodder that will
feed into that conversation.

00:08:52.158 --> 00:08:52.624
Okay.
 

00:08:52.624 --> 00:08:57.830
So, I want to start by talking
about African Americans.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:03.149
Now certainly the period of
conflict, of actual fighting

00:09:03.149 --> 00:09:08.274
during the Revolution,
really stirred things up in the

00:09:08.274 --> 00:09:12.240
realm of slavery in a number of
ways.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.240
For one thing,
on the sort of simple,

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.763
basic level of logistics,
the war just created confusion

00:09:20.763 --> 00:09:23.759
and disorder,
and because things were

00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:27.778
disordered in wartime it
provided some opportunities for

00:09:27.778 --> 00:09:29.240
slaves to escape.
 

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.470
So just the mass confusion of
war enabled some slaves to flee

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.480
plantations and perhaps to pose
as free men.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.770
Equally important,
the Revolution spread its

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:48.658
message to black Americans as
well as to white Americans.

00:09:48.658 --> 00:09:51.490
The message of the Revolution
or maybe the messages,

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.610
plural, of the Revolution were
not invisible to black

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.131
Americans--
free black Americans or

00:09:58.131 --> 00:09:59.820
enslaved black Americans.
 

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.490
Regardless of whether they were
free or enslaved,

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.313
people could hear these
messages, this rhetoric of

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:08.932
liberty and freedom,
and translate it into their own

00:10:08.932 --> 00:10:09.450
lives.
 

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.340
And you can see both of these
things;

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.826
you can see the impact of the
confusion of war and you can see

00:10:14.826 --> 00:10:17.570
the impact of the messages of
the Revolution,

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.600
in the actions of the
British--or actually,

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.508
of Virginia's colonial
governor--but I'm calling him

00:10:22.508 --> 00:10:24.304
"the British"
because he's loyal to the

00:10:24.304 --> 00:10:26.765
King--
in 1775 in Virginia,

00:10:26.765 --> 00:10:31.460
and then the response of slaves
in Virginia.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.508
Now logically enough during the
war, the British--among the

00:10:35.508 --> 00:10:39.835
things that they're trying to do
is to--Creating chaos would be

00:10:39.835 --> 00:10:41.580
happy for them to do.
 

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:41.860
Right?
 

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.522
That would just sort of give
more of a disadvantage to the

00:10:44.522 --> 00:10:45.129
Americans.
 

00:10:45.129 --> 00:10:48.792
So the British are trying to
think of ways to make things

00:10:48.792 --> 00:10:52.062
difficult in America,
and certainly that's the case

00:10:52.062 --> 00:10:53.110
in Virginia.
 

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.770
And one of the ways in which
they chose to do this concerned

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.080
the institution of slavery.
 

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.278
So specifically,
on November 7,1775,

00:11:01.278 --> 00:11:04.548
the colonial governor of
Virginia who,

00:11:04.548 --> 00:11:06.620
as I just mentioned,
was loyal to the Crown--

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.658
his name was Lord Dunmore--he
passed a proclamation calling on

00:11:11.658 --> 00:11:15.460
slaves who belonged to
rebellious planters,

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.976
and stating that any of these
slaves who were willing to bear

00:11:18.976 --> 00:11:22.549
arms in the service of the Crown
should flee their masters and

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:25.948
come to the British encampment
at Norfolk and fight for the

00:11:25.948 --> 00:11:26.769
British.
 

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:30.754
And any slave who fled from a
rebellious master and came to

00:11:30.754 --> 00:11:34.509
fight with the British,
this proclamation promised that

00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:38.197
he would earn freedom at the end
of the war in exchange for

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:39.470
military service.
 

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.096
And this becomes known as Lord
-- logically,

00:11:43.096 --> 00:11:47.058
Lord Dunmore's Proclamation,
November 7,1775.

00:11:47.058 --> 00:11:53.340
Now roughly 800 slaves actually
did reach Norfolk,

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.440
and it's probable that there
would have been more,

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.110
but it was not necessarily an
easy thing,

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.443
despite the disorder of war,
for people to just flee from

00:12:00.443 --> 00:12:03.201
plantations,
and there probably was a good

00:12:03.201 --> 00:12:07.100
deal of vigilance on the part of
plantation holders.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.980
So it was not necessarily easy
to run to Norfolk,

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.558
but roughly 800 slaves did
reach Norfolk.

00:12:12.558 --> 00:12:15.977
And with those black
volunteers, Dunmore established

00:12:15.977 --> 00:12:18.658
what he called his Ethiopian
Regiment.

00:12:18.658 --> 00:12:23.272
And his Ethiopian Regiment wore
uniforms with a badge that

00:12:23.272 --> 00:12:26.590
declared "liberty to
slaves."

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.864
Okay.
 

00:12:26.864 --> 00:12:28.620
So the message is really clear.
 

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:35.149
However, in a battle fought in
Virginia on--

00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:38.673
in December of 1775,
Virginian soldiers actually

00:12:38.673 --> 00:12:43.024
overwhelmed the British and the
Ethiopian Regiment and some

00:12:43.024 --> 00:12:45.875
white Loyalists,
all of them sort of fighting

00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:49.190
together there,
and Dunmore was forced to

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.725
evacuate by sea,
and he took his black

00:12:52.725 --> 00:12:54.428
volunteers with him.
 

00:12:54.428 --> 00:12:57.823
Now sadly, in a variety of
ways, and I suppose in a way

00:12:57.823 --> 00:13:00.697
it's not unexpected,
Dunmore's proclamation

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:03.750
ultimately contained a lot of
empty promises,

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:09.629
sort of really amazingly sadly.
 

00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:12.759
Some British soldiers just
couldn't resist the temptation

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:15.947
to sell some of these black
volunteers in the West Indies,

00:13:15.947 --> 00:13:17.009
which they did.
 

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:21.190
Some actually went aboard ship
with Dunmore,

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.860
were headed back to England and
apparently there was a smallpox

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.168
outbreak aboard some of these
ships,

00:13:27.168 --> 00:13:30.534
and a number of these
volunteers died at sea of

00:13:30.534 --> 00:13:31.340
smallpox.
 

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:36.309
So things didn't necessarily
end really well for these

00:13:36.309 --> 00:13:37.529
volunteers.
 

00:13:37.529 --> 00:13:40.139
Now, not necessarily these
volunteers,

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:43.529
but looking a little bit more
broadly at what black Americans

00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:46.580
are doing during and in the wake
of the Revolution,

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.926
some enslaved and free black
Americans who sided with the

00:13:50.926 --> 00:13:52.731
British,
instead of running to

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:55.091
Norfolk--maybe they were in a
different state or in a

00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:57.383
different situation--
some of them actually,

00:13:57.383 --> 00:13:59.899
ultimately, sometimes at the
end of the war,

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:01.799
made their way to Canada.
 

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.320
Canada's back.
 

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.570
Free Canada.
 

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.732
Some made their way to Canada
and in particular Nova Scotia

00:14:08.732 --> 00:14:11.028
and Quebec among other places.
 

00:14:11.028 --> 00:14:14.479
Historians, generally speaking,
don't have precise numbers

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:17.990
about the number of black
Americans who went to Canada,

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.720
but probably we're talking in
the thousands.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.278
Now it's important to note here
that I've just been talking

00:14:24.278 --> 00:14:27.899
about people running to freedom
and free black Americans.

00:14:27.899 --> 00:14:32.895
I'm not meaning to suggest that
Canada is a slave-free zone,

00:14:32.895 --> 00:14:34.590
because it wasn't.
 

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.332
And as a matter of fact,
Loyalists, white Loyalists who

00:14:38.332 --> 00:14:42.493
went to Canada after the war and
happened to be slave owners,

00:14:42.493 --> 00:14:44.918
brought their slaves with them.
 

00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:47.453
So it's not as though Canada
was this sort of happy freedom

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:47.759
zone.
 

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:50.474
For some people,
as I'll mention in a minute,

00:14:50.474 --> 00:14:53.065
it was somewhat,
but for many other people,

00:14:53.065 --> 00:14:57.678
they were slaves in America;
they were slaves in Canada.

00:14:57.678 --> 00:15:02.916
There were a number of free
black men who immigrated to

00:15:02.916 --> 00:15:08.211
Canada and once they were there,
they assumed logically that

00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:12.158
they deserved the same benefits
that white Loyalists were

00:15:12.158 --> 00:15:13.990
getting from the Crown.
 

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.080
So these are free black men who
sided with the British,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.763
they go to Canada,
and the Crown had promised

00:15:18.763 --> 00:15:21.690
white Loyalists sort of any
number of things,

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.078
including land grants,
as a reward for being loyal

00:15:24.078 --> 00:15:25.250
during the Revolution.
 

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:29.129
These free black men also go to
Canada, assuming they've been

00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:32.168
loyal and they deserve land
grants in Canada.

00:15:32.168 --> 00:15:36.011
And there actually were some
free black men who did get land

00:15:36.011 --> 00:15:37.250
grants in Canada.
 

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.779
However, of course this was not
an entirely fair process.

00:15:40.779 --> 00:15:45.355
So you have white Loyalists
being given grants of hundreds

00:15:45.355 --> 00:15:49.255
of acres of land;
you have black Loyalists being

00:15:49.255 --> 00:15:53.058
given sometimes as little as one
acre of land,

00:15:53.058 --> 00:15:56.070
sometimes as much as fifty
acres of land,

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.360
nowhere near sort of parity,
nothing equal going on here.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.952
And apparently also,
areas in which black Loyalists

00:16:03.952 --> 00:16:07.259
were given land tended to be
segregated off.

00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:10.601
So we're not talking about
equality, we're not talking

00:16:10.601 --> 00:16:13.817
about a slave-free zone,
and we're not talking about

00:16:13.817 --> 00:16:15.710
sudden equality of status.
 

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:20.350
Now of course,
slaves did not just serve in

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:25.322
the British Army,
or only ally themselves with

00:16:25.322 --> 00:16:27.090
the British.
 

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.821
Some joined the Continental
Army, as did some free black

00:16:31.821 --> 00:16:34.285
Americans,
though at the outset,

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:37.686
the Continental Army forbade
the enlistment of African

00:16:37.686 --> 00:16:38.519
Americans.
 

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:40.788
So at the beginning of the war,
this was not something being

00:16:40.788 --> 00:16:41.250
discussed.
 

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.220
However, after the war had been
dragging on for a while,

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.320
certainly longer than people
thought it would,

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.102
and the Continental Army and
Congress really began to be

00:16:50.102 --> 00:16:53.000
desperate for manpower,
suddenly this issue was

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.678
revisited, and at least in the
North,

00:16:55.678 --> 00:16:59.625
some states began to enlist
black soldiers to fight in the

00:16:59.625 --> 00:17:00.940
Continental Army.
 

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:05.348
By the end of the war,
most of the states--

00:17:05.348 --> 00:17:08.278
some of the obviously Southern
states are holdouts here--

00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:11.930
but most of the states had
recruited some black soldiers.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.752
Roughly 5,000 black soldiers
served in the Continental Army,

00:17:15.752 --> 00:17:18.798
logically enough most of them
from the North.

00:17:18.798 --> 00:17:23.324
The majority were slaves
serving with their masters'

00:17:23.324 --> 00:17:26.338
consent in separate black units.
 

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:29.960
Some hoped to be fighting
towards their emancipation,

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.740
so again on a really personal
level,

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.838
did feel like they were
fighting for freedom,

00:17:33.838 --> 00:17:37.630
not just American freedom but
personal freedom.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:43.315
And an example of this--just
this mentality--You can see this

00:17:43.315 --> 00:17:49.190
in the 289 identifiably black
men in the Connecticut forces.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:53.301
Of that--those 289 black men,
five of them when asked to give

00:17:53.301 --> 00:17:56.385
their surname,
reported that their surname was

00:17:56.385 --> 00:17:58.578
Liberty when they signed on.
 

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:03.007
Eighteen when they signed on
reported that their last name

00:18:03.007 --> 00:18:04.950
was Freedom or Freeman.
 

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.371
And I have to say,
speaking as Joanne Freeman,

00:18:07.371 --> 00:18:10.490
my Eastern-European ancestors
had the same impulse at Ellis

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:11.836
Island I think:
[laughter]

00:18:11.836 --> 00:18:12.589
Freeman.
 

00:18:12.589 --> 00:18:14.808
So I understand.
 

00:18:14.808 --> 00:18:18.258
But you can see there,
you can get a sense there,

00:18:18.258 --> 00:18:22.210
of the mindset of what--behind
what people are doing.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:27.752
So we've seen in a variety of
ways here that the war shook up

00:18:27.752 --> 00:18:31.450
the system of slavery in several
ways.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:36.000
We've seen that the message of
the Revolution certainly had an

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.910
impact on America's slave
population.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:44.136
The Revolution also changed the
views of some white Americans

00:18:44.136 --> 00:18:45.880
regarding slavery.
 

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.404
Given the Revolution's message
of liberty and the ways in which

00:18:49.404 --> 00:18:52.983
Americans actually did regularly
use the rhetoric of enslavement

00:18:52.983 --> 00:18:55.769
to describe their relationship
with Britain--

00:18:55.769 --> 00:18:56.980
right? We are not slaves.
 

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.412
They are treating us like
slaves--some white Americans

00:19:00.412 --> 00:19:03.778
were moved to take action on the
issue of slavery.

00:19:03.778 --> 00:19:06.625
Now of course,
some foreign observers were

00:19:06.625 --> 00:19:10.928
pretty quick to see the irony in
a slave-holding society crying

00:19:10.928 --> 00:19:13.150
out for liberty and freedom.
 

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.170
And the most famous example of
this--

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:16.940
many of you may have heard this
quote already--

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.890
is from Samuel Johnson,
who said, "How is it that

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:23.007
we hear the loudest yelps for
liberty from the drivers of

00:19:23.007 --> 00:19:24.009
negroes?"
 

00:19:24.009 --> 00:19:26.750
He just pins the point right on
its head.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.750
But some people were actually
moved to action.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.993
For example,
ideas early in the war that we

00:19:33.993 --> 00:19:38.473
talked about earlier in the
course about boycotting certain

00:19:38.473 --> 00:19:41.483
items of trade,
like the Continental

00:19:41.483 --> 00:19:45.583
Association, those ideas
inspired some Americans to seize

00:19:45.583 --> 00:19:49.608
the opportunity to prohibit
trade in slaves as well.

00:19:49.608 --> 00:19:53.630
And some of the more radical
colonies like Pennsylvania,

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.432
Connecticut,
and Rhode Island--I want a

00:19:56.432 --> 00:20:00.790
rousing cheer for Rhode Island--
some of the more radical

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:05.111
colonies actually passed acts
prohibiting the slave trade

00:20:05.111 --> 00:20:06.500
during the war.
 

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.108
So Pennsylvania in 1773 did
that;

00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:14.900
Rhode Island and Connecticut in
1774 did that.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:20.423
Between 1777 and 1784,
five states actually ended

00:20:20.423 --> 00:20:22.806
slavery--
and I'm going to come back to a

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:25.108
moment as to what I mean when I
say "ended slavery"--

00:20:25.108 --> 00:20:28.538
Vermont, Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts,

00:20:28.538 --> 00:20:30.487
Rhode Island,
and Connecticut,

00:20:30.487 --> 00:20:34.450
though in many cases they
proposed gradual emancipation--

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.690
so again this is not instant
end of problem--

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:42.460
for example declaring all
children born of an enslaved

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.058
woman to be free after a certain
date.

00:20:46.058 --> 00:20:48.998
Quakers were also moved,
or at least some Quakers were

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:51.048
also moved to act against
slavery,

00:20:51.048 --> 00:20:55.430
and certainly by the end of the
war some Quaker slave owners had

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:56.890
freed their slaves.
 

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.846
I think a pretty hefty
percentage of Quakers actually

00:20:59.846 --> 00:21:00.700
freed slaves.
 

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:06.380
Sometimes black Americans were
spurred to action.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.374
So for example,
in states that considered

00:21:09.374 --> 00:21:14.240
slaves to be not only property
but also people before the law,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.049
like Massachusetts,
there were actually some slaves

00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:20.028
who brought suit against their
masters for freedom.

00:21:20.028 --> 00:21:24.528
Now these kinds of attempts may
not have often been successful,

00:21:24.528 --> 00:21:28.032
but they certainly had the
potential to force slave owners

00:21:28.032 --> 00:21:30.430
to grapple with the idea of
slavery,

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.858
with its legality,
with its morality.

00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:36.170
So as far as slavery is
concerned in the North,

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.618
the Revolution caused some
change, though there was still a

00:21:39.618 --> 00:21:43.128
general refusal to offer freed
blacks full membership in the

00:21:43.128 --> 00:21:46.460
political community or to raise
their social status.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.000
But in the South,
slavery emerged from the

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.627
Revolution as a firmly
entrenched sectional

00:21:53.627 --> 00:21:55.009
institution.
 

00:21:55.009 --> 00:21:58.095
Now of course,
the South was economically

00:21:58.095 --> 00:22:00.950
dependent on the system of
slavery.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.380
In a way, the Revolution only
made this more obvious to

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.269
southerners.
 

00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:08.019
Military occupation by the
British,

00:22:08.019 --> 00:22:10.838
British attempts--as in Lord
Dunmore--

00:22:10.838 --> 00:22:14.748
to use slavery as a tactic to
upset the American cause:

00:22:14.748 --> 00:22:19.307
those sorts of things seemed to
really threaten the social order

00:22:19.307 --> 00:22:22.928
of the South,
and many Southerners responded

00:22:22.928 --> 00:22:27.642
by deciding that the restoration
and regulation of slavery was

00:22:27.642 --> 00:22:31.351
indispensable for the
rehabilitation of the South

00:22:31.351 --> 00:22:32.818
after the war.
 

00:22:32.818 --> 00:22:35.828
So the result was the further
entrenchment of slavery

00:22:35.828 --> 00:22:38.779
throughout the South,
although I think a little less

00:22:38.779 --> 00:22:39.880
so in Maryland.
 

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.545
So for example in some states
where a large percentage of the

00:22:43.545 --> 00:22:46.598
slave population had been lost
in various ways,

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:50.366
planters began to import slaves
from Africa in earnest in mass

00:22:50.366 --> 00:22:51.170
quantities.
 

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.895
So for example,
South Carolina lost a large

00:22:53.895 --> 00:22:57.596
percentage of their slave
population in one way or another

00:22:57.596 --> 00:22:58.828
during the war.
 

00:22:58.828 --> 00:23:01.916
Before 1800,
they had imported almost 20,000

00:23:01.916 --> 00:23:04.000
Africans to South Carolina.
 

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.346
And obviously,
as we're going to see in future

00:23:07.346 --> 00:23:10.140
lectures,
given this divide over the

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.951
issue of slavery,
it became a continual

00:23:12.951 --> 00:23:17.151
deal-breaker whenever any sort
of national initiative was being

00:23:17.151 --> 00:23:20.219
discussed,
like the drafting of a new

00:23:20.219 --> 00:23:21.358
Constitution.
 

00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:24.509
Again and again over the course
of the next few decades,

00:23:24.509 --> 00:23:28.490
the issue of slavery would be
raised and then dropped,

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:32.757
sometimes immediately dropped,
always being sidestepped as

00:23:32.757 --> 00:23:37.250
just being too dangerous to
handle in a fragile new union.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.005
And obviously if you look far
down the road,

00:23:40.005 --> 00:23:43.721
this kind of behavior was no
solution, because way down the

00:23:43.721 --> 00:23:45.900
road we end up in a civil war.
 

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.058
Now as I said at the outset,
I'm going to let you discuss

00:23:49.058 --> 00:23:51.259
for yourselves in a couple of
weeks,

00:23:51.259 --> 00:23:54.410
thinking back over the
semester, about the implications

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.920
of the information that I just
gave you,

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.003
about slavery and whether or
not this constitutes radical

00:24:00.003 --> 00:24:00.500
change.
 

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.440
What does this mean?
 

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.192
Now I want to turn to the
question of women and how the

00:24:06.192 --> 00:24:08.068
Revolution affected them.
 

00:24:08.068 --> 00:24:12.286
And I've already mentioned in
past lectures how women were

00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:15.318
politicized with the resistance
effort.

00:24:15.318 --> 00:24:17.890
Boycotting British goods is an
act of--

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.182
It's a political act ,and women
are often the people who are

00:24:21.182 --> 00:24:24.223
purchasing goods--
that the need to spin and weave

00:24:24.223 --> 00:24:26.505
homespun cloth,
because British manufactured

00:24:26.505 --> 00:24:29.173
goods are being boycotted--
again, that's a really

00:24:29.173 --> 00:24:30.160
political act.
 

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:35.558
So some of the daily actions of
women became politicized during

00:24:35.558 --> 00:24:37.038
the Revolution.
 

00:24:37.038 --> 00:24:40.434
And there were some women who
were even more overtly

00:24:40.434 --> 00:24:44.497
political: drafting petitions,
participating in mass political

00:24:44.497 --> 00:24:45.230
events.
 

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.981
In North Carolina in 1774,
as an example of some very

00:24:48.981 --> 00:24:53.103
politically activated women,
fifty-one women wrote out a

00:24:53.103 --> 00:24:56.731
resolution declaring their
allegiance to the American

00:24:56.731 --> 00:24:57.358
cause.
 

00:24:57.358 --> 00:25:01.211
In 1780 in Philadelphia,
thirty-six women apparently

00:25:01.211 --> 00:25:05.441
created and ran an amazingly
successful campaign to raise

00:25:05.441 --> 00:25:10.343
money to equip American troops,
and supposedly in a matter of

00:25:10.343 --> 00:25:14.410
weeks these thirty-six women
raised roughly $300,000.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:18.019
Those are sort of active,
amazingly effective women.

00:25:18.019 --> 00:25:21.019
So there are some women that
are really explicitly sort of

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:24.021
campaigning politically,
but this doesn't mean that

00:25:24.021 --> 00:25:27.188
women were wholeheartedly
welcomed into the political

00:25:27.188 --> 00:25:27.980
community.
 

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:33.798
Of course, they didn't have the
franchise, except briefly in New

00:25:33.798 --> 00:25:34.630
Jersey.
 

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.339
This is a New Jersey moment.
 

00:25:36.339 --> 00:25:38.930
Is anyone here from New Jersey?
 

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.930
Oh, we have many New Jersey
people.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.125
New Jersey shines right here,
well, at least for a little

00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:43.440
while.
 

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.960
We have a shining New Jersey
moment.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.862
Believe it or not,
[laughter]

00:25:46.862 --> 00:25:49.920
for a little window of time in
New Jersey,

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.598
women had the vote during this
time period,

00:25:53.598 --> 00:25:57.920
in direct consequence of the
principles of the Revolution.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.791
And the way that this worked is
that basically as a new state,

00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:04.268
New Jersey created its own
constitution,

00:26:04.268 --> 00:26:06.298
a new constitution,
in 1776.

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:09.402
And apparently that
constitution had gender-neutral

00:26:09.402 --> 00:26:12.772
language in it,
and it referred to inhabitants

00:26:12.772 --> 00:26:15.253
voting,
inhabitants who could meet a

00:26:15.253 --> 00:26:17.509
fifty-pound property
requirement,

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:21.019
so any inhabitant who had those
fifty pounds could vote.

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:23.943
Now obviously,
that did not explicitly mention

00:26:23.943 --> 00:26:25.450
women,
but in 1790,

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:29.895
state legislators in New Jersey
passed an electoral statute

00:26:29.895 --> 00:26:33.038
explicitly affirming female
suffrage,

00:26:33.038 --> 00:26:34.779
and used the word
"he"

00:26:34.779 --> 00:26:37.640
and the word "she"
in discussing this,

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.598
so they were very
straightforward about it.

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:42.579
Now in point in fact,
only small numbers of women

00:26:42.579 --> 00:26:46.429
voted because except for a small
number of wealthy widows there

00:26:46.429 --> 00:26:49.781
were not that many women who
could satisfy the property

00:26:49.781 --> 00:26:50.900
requirement.
 

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:56.848
Still, beginning roughly in
1797, small numbers of women,

00:26:56.848 --> 00:26:59.038
probably a few hundred in any
given election,

00:26:59.038 --> 00:27:04.390
did vote in New Jersey in both
state and national elections.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.170
It's a little happy New Jersey
moment.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:14.710
However, in 1807 some election
fraud and I suppose,

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.269
lingering and persistent
anxiety about exactly what

00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:20.580
female suffrage meant,
led the New Jersey legislature,

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.118
people of all parties in the
New Jersey legislature,

00:27:24.118 --> 00:27:28.288
to pass a law explicitly
prohibiting women from voting.

00:27:28.288 --> 00:27:31.688
So literally it's this little
window, a couple of years,

00:27:31.688 --> 00:27:33.788
and then suffrage is taken
away.

00:27:33.788 --> 00:27:36.327
Interestingly,
historians have not found much

00:27:36.327 --> 00:27:38.808
protest on the part of New
Jersey women,

00:27:38.808 --> 00:27:41.728
and there was not actually a
lot of response as to what it

00:27:41.728 --> 00:27:44.888
meant to lose the vote,
but again that might be because

00:27:44.888 --> 00:27:47.250
we're talking about such small
numbers.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.945
Interestingly,
during roughly that same little

00:27:49.945 --> 00:27:52.643
window of time,
a few states experimented with

00:27:52.643 --> 00:27:55.880
black suffrage in their first
state constitutions.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.833
So New York,
New Jersey, and Pennsylvania

00:27:58.833 --> 00:28:03.557
for at least a time in their new
constitutions allowed free black

00:28:03.557 --> 00:28:04.740
men to vote.
 

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.028
This did not last for a very
long time,

00:28:07.028 --> 00:28:08.769
and as a matter of fact New
Jersey,

00:28:08.769 --> 00:28:11.848
when they took the vote away
from women also took it away

00:28:11.848 --> 00:28:13.058
from free black men.
 

00:28:13.058 --> 00:28:15.923
So there's a little window when
some states are willing to

00:28:15.923 --> 00:28:18.989
experiment with this idea and
then that experiment is ended at

00:28:18.989 --> 00:28:21.200
the beginning of the nineteenth
century.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.440
So, window of opportunity,
not a long-standing change.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:31.175
Even so, women post-Revolution
did have something of a more

00:28:31.175 --> 00:28:35.750
established political role in
the community-at-large,

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:39.479
and it's as wives and mothers,
but it's not just:

00:28:39.479 --> 00:28:41.500
'go be a wife,
go be a mother,

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.970
thank you very much,
that's good for the polity.'

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.759
It's actually a little bit more
complicated than that.

00:28:46.759 --> 00:28:50.318
Basically, as the republic got
under way,

00:28:50.318 --> 00:28:54.602
it was assumed that women would
have an important political role

00:28:54.602 --> 00:28:56.556
to play,
and this has to do with the

00:28:56.556 --> 00:28:57.538
nature of a republic.
 

00:28:57.538 --> 00:29:01.334
A republic is supposedly
grounded on a populace that

00:29:01.334 --> 00:29:04.308
understands its liberties and
rights,

00:29:04.308 --> 00:29:07.118
is vigilant to protect those
liberties and rights,

00:29:07.118 --> 00:29:10.368
knows what it's supposed to be
doing as citizens,

00:29:10.368 --> 00:29:12.700
knows how to act as a good
citizen.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:17.161
A republic is grounded on its
citizens, the activities and the

00:29:17.161 --> 00:29:19.210
vigilance of its citizens.
 

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.085
So in a republic,
it's really important for

00:29:22.085 --> 00:29:24.893
people to understand what it
means to be a

00:29:24.893 --> 00:29:27.288
small-"r"
republican.

00:29:27.288 --> 00:29:31.651
So women, as the people who are
literally mothering new little

00:29:31.651 --> 00:29:34.440
republicans being born all the
time,

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.984
were seen to have an important
role to play as the people who

00:29:37.984 --> 00:29:41.530
were literally schooling their
children to be good republican

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.298
citizens.
 

00:29:42.298 --> 00:29:46.210
And there is a historian named
Linda Kerber and--

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.078
she is actually in your
Major Problems--

00:29:48.078 --> 00:29:50.795
There's an excerpt of what
I'm talking about here that's in

00:29:50.795 --> 00:29:52.460
your Major Problems
textbook.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.801
This historian named Linda
Kerber came up with a phrase to

00:29:55.801 --> 00:29:58.792
describe this politicized role
and she used the term

00:29:58.792 --> 00:30:00.669
"republican
motherhood"

00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:03.053
to describe it,
and historians really liked

00:30:03.053 --> 00:30:05.160
that phrase and they took it and
they ran with it,

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.788
so now you see republican
motherhood all over the place.

00:30:07.788 --> 00:30:09.868
A lot of people talk about
republican motherhood.

00:30:09.868 --> 00:30:11.640
A few people said,
'Well, actually,

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.558
I think it's more like
republican wife,' but one way or

00:30:14.558 --> 00:30:17.804
another the idea was one that
was popular with historians and

00:30:17.804 --> 00:30:18.940
they ran with it.
 

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.886
Now I mention republican
motherhood partly because I

00:30:21.886 --> 00:30:25.527
think it's a nicely descriptive
phrase that kind of sums up what

00:30:25.527 --> 00:30:27.597
I just said,
partly because historically

00:30:27.597 --> 00:30:28.970
it's significant and
historians--

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.400
if you read about women in the
Revolution,

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.490
you're going to see that phrase
all over the place--

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:35.279
but I do want to note here,
having just mentioned it,

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:37.824
it's not like people in early
America were walking around

00:30:37.824 --> 00:30:39.460
claiming to be republican
mothers.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.503
That's--Actually,
it's not something from the

00:30:41.503 --> 00:30:41.828
time.
 

00:30:41.828 --> 00:30:46.414
It's a modern idea that's being
imposed back to explain behavior

00:30:46.414 --> 00:30:48.088
from an earlier time.
 

00:30:48.088 --> 00:30:51.644
So it's not like people were
sort of using that phrase in the

00:30:51.644 --> 00:30:53.660
period that we're talking about.
 

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.173
Now to be a good republican
mother, a woman needed to be

00:30:57.173 --> 00:30:59.983
well-educated,
obviously so she could educate

00:30:59.983 --> 00:31:01.068
her children.
 

00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:03.878
So in essence,
if you were going to raise

00:31:03.878 --> 00:31:07.320
solid republican citizens,
they needed to be good,

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.640
solid republicans themselves.
 

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.313
So logically enough female
education got something of a

00:31:14.313 --> 00:31:18.512
boost after the Revolution,
and throughout the country

00:31:18.512 --> 00:31:22.336
there were a number of women's
academies and schools formed for

00:31:22.336 --> 00:31:26.160
advanced learning for women that
had not been there before.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.920
There was a lot of attention
being paid to female education.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.240
You see it in public
discussions at the time.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.854
People are actually talking
about--Men are actually talking

00:31:35.854 --> 00:31:38.970
about what is the proper
education for a woman,

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:42.598
what should be happening,
where should things be going,

00:31:42.598 --> 00:31:46.838
what should we be doing,
what's best for the republic.

00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:49.250
Now I've already talked about
how with the issue of slavery,

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:53.885
thanks to anxieties raised by
the Revolution and fears about

00:31:53.885 --> 00:31:57.691
social disorder,
some Southern states responded

00:31:57.691 --> 00:32:02.161
by focusing even more deeply on
more deeply entrenching the

00:32:02.161 --> 00:32:03.778
system of slavery.
 

00:32:03.778 --> 00:32:05.568
Not surprisingly,
in the case of women,

00:32:05.568 --> 00:32:08.634
there were some anxieties
raised by the implications of

00:32:08.634 --> 00:32:11.868
the Revolution regarding their
status and their actions as

00:32:11.868 --> 00:32:12.380
well.
 

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.950
It can be a little harder to
see but it is there.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:18.650
And one of the interesting
places where--Gosh.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:20.180
It's been a number of years.
 

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.343
A number of years ago I
stumbled across newspaper

00:32:22.343 --> 00:32:24.596
essays, and I thought they were
really fascinating,

00:32:24.596 --> 00:32:26.038
and they bear light on this.
 

00:32:26.038 --> 00:32:29.769
Eighteenth-century
newspapers--We've seen them.

00:32:29.769 --> 00:32:30.400
They're short.
 

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.588
They're a couple of pages.
 

00:32:31.588 --> 00:32:34.935
Sometimes--in the newspaper we
looked at I don't think there

00:32:34.935 --> 00:32:36.909
was one--
but sometimes they would have

00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:39.641
little satirical essays,
usually with some sort of

00:32:39.641 --> 00:32:43.172
political commentary or maybe
social commentary attached to

00:32:43.172 --> 00:32:43.660
them.
 

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.616
And what I stumbled across--and
I think both of these examples

00:32:47.616 --> 00:32:50.186
are from 1789 or 1790,
so the government has just

00:32:50.186 --> 00:32:53.317
gotten under way--
I found these little satirical

00:32:53.317 --> 00:32:55.938
essays,
both of which were kind of

00:32:55.938 --> 00:32:59.932
showing anxieties about women
having political power and

00:32:59.932 --> 00:33:03.130
making fun of women with
political power.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:06.596
So I found one essay that pokes
fun at women who are so informed

00:33:06.596 --> 00:33:09.897
politically that they know the
identity of all the people who

00:33:09.897 --> 00:33:12.318
write with pseudonyms in the
newspapers.

00:33:12.318 --> 00:33:17.769
And so it was this little sort
of sarcastic essay,

00:33:17.769 --> 00:33:20.268
sort of: well,
you women, you bad mothers who

00:33:20.268 --> 00:33:22.880
read the paper and you know who
Publius is,

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.028
but you don't know where your
child is.

00:33:26.028 --> 00:33:29.876
It's sort of--It was meant to
be funny, but that was the tone:

00:33:29.876 --> 00:33:32.653
bad mother, good politician,
bad mother, bad,

00:33:32.653 --> 00:33:34.230
bad, bad for America.
 

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:38.022
And there was another one that
was using satire to poke fun at

00:33:38.022 --> 00:33:41.691
the idea of women applying for
the position of Doorkeeper of

00:33:41.691 --> 00:33:42.500
Congress.
 

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.430
No symbolism there.
 

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:47.500
And it was an essay that was
well: what does that mean,

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.308
a woman applying to be the
Doorkeeper of Congress,

00:33:50.308 --> 00:33:53.673
acting as though that had
happened and then kind of making

00:33:53.673 --> 00:33:57.154
fun of the implications of what
it would mean if a woman had

00:33:57.154 --> 00:34:01.048
sort of a political role with an
actual political institution.

00:34:01.048 --> 00:34:03.625
So both of those things were
really interesting to me because

00:34:03.625 --> 00:34:05.494
they--
they're not directly saying,

00:34:05.494 --> 00:34:08.490
'Wow, we're really anxious
about the implications of the

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:11.402
Revolution regarding women,
so we're going to write really

00:34:11.402 --> 00:34:13.563
anxious little essays,' but
that's basically what they

00:34:13.563 --> 00:34:16.402
were--
was showing some anxieties,

00:34:16.402 --> 00:34:21.039
showing awareness of change,
and not necessarily being all

00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:24.039
that happy about what that
change might mean.

00:34:24.039 --> 00:34:24.427
Okay.
 

00:34:24.427 --> 00:34:28.699
So we've seen some ways in
which the Revolution affected

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:29.400
women.
 

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.369
I want to turn,
before I run out of time here,

00:34:32.369 --> 00:34:36.393
to Native Americans as a final
sort of test case on the bounds

00:34:36.393 --> 00:34:38.440
of the American Revolution.
 

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.974
Now, Native Americans had a
complicated experience of the

00:34:42.974 --> 00:34:47.670
American Revolution and it was
complicated in many ways.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:51.646
For one thing,
they were being courted by the

00:34:51.646 --> 00:34:55.110
British,
and the British have long had a

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:58.539
presence in Western frontier
territories,

00:34:58.539 --> 00:35:03.280
so they had experience dealing
with Native Americans.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.952
Obviously, also,
Native Americans were living on

00:35:06.952 --> 00:35:11.253
land that was constantly,
deeply desired by Americans of

00:35:11.253 --> 00:35:12.659
various sorts.
 

00:35:12.659 --> 00:35:16.795
And even before the Revolution,
white American settlers didn't

00:35:16.795 --> 00:35:20.661
need much of an excuse to wage
an attack on Indians to get

00:35:20.661 --> 00:35:22.795
land,
so that's even before the

00:35:22.795 --> 00:35:24.309
impact of the Revolution.
 

00:35:24.309 --> 00:35:28.039
Not surprisingly,
Native Americans that sided

00:35:28.039 --> 00:35:32.530
with the British really
complicated their relationship

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.650
with white Americans.
 

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.219
Americans basically struck back.
 

00:35:37.219 --> 00:35:41.527
So for example in 1776 and
1780, even as the Revolution is

00:35:41.527 --> 00:35:45.003
still going on,
you had Americans attacking the

00:35:45.003 --> 00:35:46.590
Cherokee Indians.
 

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:50.329
In 1779, Americans attacked the
Iroquois.

00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:53.800
In 1780 and '82,
they attacked the Shawnee.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.400
So even as the Revolution is
going on,

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.550
Americans are acknowledging
that they're--

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:01.219
they feel threatened by Native
Americans,

00:36:01.219 --> 00:36:03.139
they understand that there's a
link somehow between British and

00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:05.063
Native Americans,
and they're waging attacks

00:36:05.063 --> 00:36:06.768
there as well as everywhere
else.

00:36:06.768 --> 00:36:11.349
The Treaty of Paris did not
help matters.

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:15.856
The treaty ceded to the United
States British holdings east of

00:36:15.856 --> 00:36:17.630
the Mississippi River.
 

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:21.929
But given that logically enough
there were no Native American

00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:25.869
representatives at the treaty
negotiations in Paris,

00:36:25.869 --> 00:36:29.514
Native Americans were stunned
to discover later that their

00:36:29.514 --> 00:36:33.478
territory had just been signed
away by the British and given to

00:36:33.478 --> 00:36:34.630
the Americans.
 

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:38.445
One member of the Iroquois told
a British commander who was

00:36:38.445 --> 00:36:42.300
posted out on the frontier that,
quote, "If it was really

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.614
true that the English had basely
betrayed them by pretending to

00:36:45.614 --> 00:36:48.340
give up their Country to the
Americans Without their

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.244
Consent"--
I like the fact that it's

00:36:50.244 --> 00:36:52.260
"pretending"--
"without their Consent or

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.608
Consulting them,
it was an act of Cruelty and

00:36:54.608 --> 00:36:57.652
injustice that Christians
only were capable of

00:36:57.652 --> 00:36:58.530
doing."
 

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:00.739
A really strong statement.
 

00:37:00.739 --> 00:37:05.543
Even so, when American
commissioners went west after

00:37:05.543 --> 00:37:10.349
the treaty had gone into effect,
they were operating under the

00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:13.264
idea that in defeating the
British they had also defeated

00:37:13.264 --> 00:37:15.139
Britain's Native American
allies;

00:37:15.139 --> 00:37:18.429
they were the conquerors,
they had been given the land,

00:37:18.429 --> 00:37:21.451
and they actually assumed when
they headed west and were

00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:24.856
treating with Native Americans
that they were being generous by

00:37:24.856 --> 00:37:27.931
giving back to the Native
Americans some of what had been

00:37:27.931 --> 00:37:30.018
theirs but was no longer theirs.
 

00:37:30.018 --> 00:37:33.650
This was a really nice theory,
but in fact,

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:37.275
as Americans would discover
over the course of the 1780s and

00:37:37.275 --> 00:37:40.634
even into the 1790s,
as much as they could claim

00:37:40.634 --> 00:37:43.730
that they had conquered Native
Americans,

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:47.483
the new United States and
Americans in the new United

00:37:47.483 --> 00:37:50.949
States had no ability to act
like conquerors,

00:37:50.949 --> 00:37:52.920
no physical ability to act like
conquerors.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.630
They just didn't have the
military power.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:38:00.539
And throughout this period as
American settlers moved west,

00:38:00.539 --> 00:38:03.969
Native Americans went to
battle, defended their land,

00:38:03.969 --> 00:38:07.889
and often American attempts to
quash these attacks were

00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:10.139
disastrous for the Americans.
 

00:38:10.139 --> 00:38:14.014
And as an example of what we're
talking about here,

00:38:14.014 --> 00:38:17.579
in 1789 the national Army of
the United States,

00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:20.989
whatever was of it,
had roughly 700 men.

00:38:20.989 --> 00:38:25.849
The Creek Indians alone had
between 3,500 and 6,000

00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:26.920
warriors.
 

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.269
Okay.
 

00:38:27.269 --> 00:38:31.411
We're not really powerful as
far as being a sort of national

00:38:31.411 --> 00:38:34.570
presence demanding or commanding
anything.

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:38.322
For the Native Americans,
the disastrous impact of the

00:38:38.322 --> 00:38:42.643
Revolution inspired many of them
to become more united and not

00:38:42.643 --> 00:38:46.329
just as individual tribes,
but it actually united

00:38:46.329 --> 00:38:50.391
different tribal groups together
explicitly based on the idea

00:38:50.391 --> 00:38:54.521
that they were different from
white people and needed to unite

00:38:54.521 --> 00:38:55.739
against them.
 

00:38:55.739 --> 00:38:59.239
Tribe and tribe and tribe and
tribe together needed to form

00:38:59.239 --> 00:39:02.737
unity in a way in which they
hadn't necessarily done before

00:39:02.737 --> 00:39:04.789
to unite against white people.
 

00:39:04.789 --> 00:39:08.634
Now this wasn't true for all
Native Americans,

00:39:08.634 --> 00:39:13.760
nor did all of them assume that
their only option was war.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:19.349
Some did decide to try to blend
in to communities--

00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:20.719
black communities,
white communities--

00:39:20.719 --> 00:39:23.659
and white Americans throughout
this period,

00:39:23.659 --> 00:39:26.695
some of them at least,
also were busily trying to

00:39:26.695 --> 00:39:30.552
convince some Native Americans
to just take up agriculture and

00:39:30.552 --> 00:39:31.880
sort of blend in.
 

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.289
If they could take a little
plot of land and begin farming,

00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:37.661
some Americans thought that
maybe that would be an

00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:40.385
alternative to warfare,
that native Americans could

00:39:40.385 --> 00:39:42.610
kind of become part of American
society.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:46.146
Thomas Jefferson talks about
this some in Notes on the

00:39:46.146 --> 00:39:47.409
State of Virginia.
 

00:39:47.409 --> 00:39:50.498
And for many white
Americans, this was the only

00:39:50.498 --> 00:39:53.958
option that they could envision
that might prevent future

00:39:53.958 --> 00:39:57.320
warfare and--
bloody, nasty future warfare.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:03.018
But as you can tell by a lot of
what I just said there,

00:40:03.018 --> 00:40:06.623
in the end generally speaking
the Revolution brought nothing

00:40:06.623 --> 00:40:10.349
but trouble to North America's
native peoples and that trouble

00:40:10.349 --> 00:40:12.670
would persist for decades to
come.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:13.929
It's interesting.
 

00:40:13.929 --> 00:40:16.610
I--I'm going to give a little
shout-out here.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:19.503
I have a senior essay
writer--Senior essays are on my

00:40:19.503 --> 00:40:23.010
mind, since all I'm doing is
reading drafts of senior essays.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:27.032
But I have a senior essay
writer who is writing his essay

00:40:27.032 --> 00:40:29.690
on the fact that there's a
little,

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:31.969
tiny window--we're talking
about a lot of little,

00:40:31.969 --> 00:40:34.817
tiny windows--a little,
tiny window at the beginning of

00:40:34.817 --> 00:40:37.190
the new government under the
Constitution,

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:40.679
and there was a brief period in
which the national government

00:40:40.679 --> 00:40:43.221
thought well,
maybe we can actually have

00:40:43.221 --> 00:40:46.010
sincere diplomacy with the
Native Americans;

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:49.643
we can sort of treat them like
a foreign nation and do

00:40:49.643 --> 00:40:52.659
something that will maybe waylay
problems.

00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:54.780
It's not a window that lasts
very long,

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.789
and when that window is over,
there is more nasty warfare,

00:40:57.789 --> 00:41:00.630
but that's what this senior
essay is about,

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.952
that little window that this
essay argues is often not

00:41:03.952 --> 00:41:07.650
recognized because people look
to sort of Jackson wiping out

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:10.548
Native Americans,
and they just transpose that

00:41:10.548 --> 00:41:12.543
back across time,
and they don't really

00:41:12.543 --> 00:41:15.480
acknowledge that this little bit
of diplomacy here was serious.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.405
They sort of assume--Some
historians assume that it was

00:41:18.405 --> 00:41:21.550
just a delaying measure while
Americans built up troops.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:26.164
So anyway, in one way or
another the Revolution brought

00:41:26.164 --> 00:41:29.670
nothing but trouble to native
peoples,

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:33.789
and that trouble obviously
continued and in a way got worse

00:41:33.789 --> 00:41:35.139
in years to come.
 

00:41:35.139 --> 00:41:35.552
Okay.
 

00:41:35.552 --> 00:41:40.257
So we've looked at the impact
of the Revolution on African

00:41:40.257 --> 00:41:43.889
Americans, on women,
on Native Americans.

00:41:43.889 --> 00:41:46.559
We've seen their experiences of
the Revolution.

00:41:46.559 --> 00:41:51.106
We've seen some of the impact
of those experience--experiences

00:41:51.106 --> 00:41:52.449
and the outcome.
 

00:41:52.449 --> 00:41:56.211
We've seen some change,
some of it for the better,

00:41:56.211 --> 00:42:00.590
some of it long standing,
some of it maybe not so much.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:05.572
We've seen also how change
doesn't happen in a predictable,

00:42:05.572 --> 00:42:07.550
linear kind of a way.
 

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:09.969
I think there is an assumption
when you think about the history

00:42:09.969 --> 00:42:11.896
of almost anything,
but certainly maybe in the

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:14.929
history of your own country,
that things are always getting

00:42:14.929 --> 00:42:15.409
better.
 

00:42:15.409 --> 00:42:17.945
They started out sort of
primitive, but they're always

00:42:17.945 --> 00:42:18.760
getting better.
 

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.628
And I think in particular when
you look at the sort of subject

00:42:21.628 --> 00:42:23.699
we look at today,
what you see is that things

00:42:23.699 --> 00:42:24.639
sort of do this.
 

00:42:24.639 --> 00:42:24.925
Right?
 

00:42:24.925 --> 00:42:26.739
Things are not always getting
better.

00:42:26.739 --> 00:42:30.815
History is actually actions and
reactions, and sometimes the

00:42:30.815 --> 00:42:32.679
reaction is not so great.
 

00:42:32.679 --> 00:42:35.179
So, things get better,
they get worse,

00:42:35.179 --> 00:42:36.960
they kind of stay the same,
maybe they're a little better,

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.900
maybe they're even better,
and then they get worse again.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.719
And I think taking the long
view of American history,

00:42:42.719 --> 00:42:45.472
I think that's a more realistic
way to think about how things

00:42:45.472 --> 00:42:48.496
change over time,
than to assume that everything

00:42:48.496 --> 00:42:49.900
always gets better.
 

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.289
I think these three populations
show that really dramatically.

00:42:53.289 --> 00:42:56.583
However, I'm not going to tell
you whether I think that means

00:42:56.583 --> 00:42:58.780
that the Revolution is radical
or not.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.349
I think I successfully did not
do that in that lecture;

00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:02.059
I hope I did.
 

00:43:02.059 --> 00:43:03.750
And I'm going to be really
interested,

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:07.099
after you meet and have that
discussion,

00:43:07.099 --> 00:43:10.969
to hear what you discussed,
what you think,

00:43:10.969 --> 00:43:13.958
what your thoughts are,
how radical was the American

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:14.719
Revolution.
 

00:43:14.719 --> 00:43:18.780
And I will end there and I will
see you next week.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:24.000

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.278
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Everything I told

00:00:04.278 --> 00:00:06.942
you last time,
you can summarize in these two

00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:07.790
equations.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.157
Remember what we did.
We said, "Let's take,

00:00:14.157 --> 00:00:18.388
for the simplest case that we
can possibly imagine,

00:00:18.388 --> 00:00:23.634
namely a particle moving in one
dimension along the x-axis with

00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:26.850
a constant acceleration
a.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.580
What is the fate of this
particle?"

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.506
The answer was:
at any time t,

00:00:31.506 --> 00:00:36.060
the location of the particle is
given by this formula.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.933
You can easily check by taking
two derivatives that this

00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.500
particle does have the
acceleration a.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.869
So what are these two other
numbers--x_0

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:54.450
and v_0 and
x-not and v-not?

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.000
I think we know now what they
mean.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.665
They tell you the initial
location and initial velocity of

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:03.469
the object.
For example,

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.290
suppose you use vertical motion
and you use y instead of

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.349
x;
and a would be -g;

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:14.489
that's a particle falling down
under the affect of gravity.

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:17.540
If all you know is the particle
is falling under the affect of

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.290
gravity, that's not enough to
say where the particle is,

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.240
right?
Suppose we all go to a tall

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.142
building and start throwing
things at various times and

00:01:25.142 --> 00:01:27.930
various speeds.
We're all throwing objects

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.750
whose acceleration is -g.
But the objects are at

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.290
different locations at a given
time.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.178
That's because they could have
been released from different

00:01:37.178 --> 00:01:39.370
heights with different initial
velocities.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.010
Therefore, it's not simply
enough to say what the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.782
acceleration is.
You have to give these two

00:01:44.782 --> 00:01:46.709
numbers.
Then once you've got those two

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.629
numbers, they're no longer free
parameters;

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:52.360
they're concrete numbers,
maybe 5 and 9.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.471
Then for any time t,
you plug in the time t

00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:59.159
and you will get the location.
If you took the derivative of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.320
this, you will get the velocity
at time t,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.967
it would be:
v(t) =

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:06.469
v_0 +
at.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.400
Again, you should not memorize
the formula.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.379
I hope you know why it makes
sense, right?

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.659
You want to know how fast the
guy is moving.

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.519
This is the starting speed,
that's the rate at which it is

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.827
gaining velocity,
and that's how long it's been

00:02:17.827 --> 00:02:20.740
gaining it.
So you add the two.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.934
This also means the following.
It is true that if you give me

00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:29.970
the time, I can tell you the
velocity.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.316
Conversely, if I knew the
velocity of this object,

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:37.072
I also know what time it is,
provided I knew the initial

00:02:37.072 --> 00:02:39.977
velocity.
Therefore, mathematically at a

00:02:39.977 --> 00:02:43.003
given time t,
we can trade t for

00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:45.760
v and put it into this
formula.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.147
Banish t everywhere.
By doing it,

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:48.911
I got this formula:
v^(2) =

00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:49.745
v_0^(2) + 2
a

00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:50.440
(x-x_0).

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.390
This is a matter of simple
algebra, of taking this and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.552
putting it here.
But I showed you in the end how

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.250
we can use calculus to derive
that.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.377
I got the feeling,
when I was talking to some of

00:03:11.377 --> 00:03:15.370
you guys, that maybe you should
brush up on your calculus.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.918
You have done it before,
but when you say,

00:03:17.918 --> 00:03:21.150
"I know calculus," sometimes it
means you know it,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.323
sometimes it means you know of
some fellow who does or you met

00:03:25.323 --> 00:03:27.840
somebody who knows.
That's not good enough.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.440
You really have to know
calculus.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.017
This is a constant problem.
It's nothing to do with you

00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:34.893
guys.
It is just that you have done

00:03:34.893 --> 00:03:37.291
it at various times.
It's a problem we have dealt

00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:39.710
with in the Physics Department
year after year.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.210
One solution for that is to get
a copy of a textbook I wrote

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.720
called Basic Training in
Mathematics.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.854
It's of a paperback for $30.
I've given the name of the book

00:03:52.854 --> 00:03:56.117
on the class' website.
If I hadn't written it,

00:03:56.117 --> 00:03:58.968
I would prescribe it,
but that is a little awkward

00:03:58.968 --> 00:04:00.974
moment.
You don't want to sell your own

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:02.090
book.
On the other hand,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.703
you don't have to withhold
information that may be useful

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.613
to the class.
I think that book will give you

00:04:07.613 --> 00:04:11.172
all the basic principles you
need in calculus of one

00:04:11.172 --> 00:04:12.935
variable,
more variables,

00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:16.266
elementary complex numbers,
maybe solving some problems

00:04:16.266 --> 00:04:19.610
with vectors and so on,
which you're going to get into.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.110
Whether you are going into
physics or not is irrelevant.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.462
If you're going into any
science that uses mathematics --

00:04:25.462 --> 00:04:28.874
chemistry, or engineering,
or even economics -- you should

00:04:28.874 --> 00:04:31.089
find the contents of that
useful.

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:35.258
I think it'll be in your
interest to get that any way you

00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:37.675
like.
You can go to Amazon or you can

00:04:37.675 --> 00:04:40.532
go to our bookstore.
The bookstore has some copies,

00:04:40.532 --> 00:04:42.629
but they are really for another
course.

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.009
So you should look at it and
order it on your own.

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:52.130
Okay, so I will now proceed to
the actual subject matter for

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.995
today.
I told you, the way I'm going

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:59.345
to teach any subject is going to
start with the easiest example

00:04:59.345 --> 00:05:03.134
and lull you into some kind of
security and then slowly

00:05:03.134 --> 00:05:06.959
increase the difficulty.
What's the next difficult thing?

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:10.357
The next difficult thing is to
consider motion in higher

00:05:10.357 --> 00:05:14.610
dimensions.
How high do you want to go?

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.484
For most of us,
we can go up to three

00:05:16.484 --> 00:05:19.399
dimensions because we know we
live in a three-dimensional

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:21.949
world.
Everything moves around in 3D.

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.009
That'll be enough for this
course.

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.021
In fact, I'm going to use only
two dimensions for most of the

00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:31.967
time because the difference
between one dimension and two is

00:05:31.967 --> 00:05:34.569
very great.
Between two and three and four

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.204
and so on is not very different.
There's only one occasion where

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:41.289
it helps to go to three
dimensions because there are

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.220
certain things you can do in 3D
you cannot do in less than 3D.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.803
But that's later,
so we don't have to worry about

00:05:47.803 --> 00:05:50.550
that.
We'll stop at two.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.988
If you talk to string
theorists, they will tell you

00:05:52.988 --> 00:05:54.940
there are really,
how many dimensions?

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.768
Do you know?
There are actually ten,

00:05:58.768 --> 00:06:01.955
including space and time.
There are nine spatial

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:04.156
dimensions.
That's why I call them string

00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:06.391
guys.
Mathematicians have luckily

00:06:06.391 --> 00:06:10.233
told us how to analyze the
mathematics in any number of

00:06:10.233 --> 00:06:12.774
dimensions.
We don't pay attention to them

00:06:12.774 --> 00:06:15.658
when they are going beyond
three, but now we know we need

00:06:15.658 --> 00:06:18.410
that.
We're going to do two.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.033
Our picture now is going to be
some particle that's traveling

00:06:23.033 --> 00:06:30.390
in the xy plane.
The guy is just moving around

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.009
like this.
This is not an x versus

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:35.829
time plot or y versus
time.

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:37.670
It's the actual motion of the
particle.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.020
If you say, "Where is time?"
one way to mark time is to

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.745
imagine it carries a clock as it
moves, and put markers every

00:06:47.745 --> 00:06:50.549
second.
That may be t = 0,

00:06:50.549 --> 00:06:53.360
t = 1,
t = 2 and so on.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.091
So, time is measured as a
parameter along the motion of

00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:58.819
the particle.
It is not explicitly shown.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.458
You can sort of tell the
particles moving slowly or

00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:06.970
rapidly by looking at the space
in between these tick marks.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.867
For example,
here, in one second it went

00:07:08.867 --> 00:07:10.864
from here to here.
Here, in one second,

00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:13.475
it seems to have gone much
further, so it's probably

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:17.029
traveling faster.
If you want to describe this

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:22.851
particle, what's the kinematics?
You can pick a point and say,

00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:27.042
"I'm at the point xy."
So, when you go to two

00:07:27.042 --> 00:07:29.319
dimensions, you need a pair of
numbers.

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:31.600
Instead of x,
you need x and y.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.005
But what we will find is,
it's more convenient to lump

00:07:35.005 --> 00:07:38.603
these two numbers into a single
entity, which is called a

00:07:38.603 --> 00:07:41.110
vector.
That's what we're going to talk

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.550
about a little bit,
talk a little bit about

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.872
vectors.
You guys have also seen

00:07:45.872 --> 00:07:49.969
vectors, I'm pretty sure,
but it is worth going over some

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.920
properties and some may be new
and some may be old.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.104
For the simplest context in
which one can motivate a vector

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:04.019
and also motivate the rules for
dealing with vectors,

00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:09.962
is when you look at real space,
the coordinates x and

00:08:09.962 --> 00:08:14.568
x.
And let's imagine that I went

00:08:14.568 --> 00:08:18.573
on a camping trip.
On the first day,

00:08:18.573 --> 00:08:23.569
here is where I was.
Then, I tell you I went for 5

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:29.130
km on the second day and another
5 km on the third day.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:36.139
Then I ask you, "Where am I?
How far am I from camp?"

00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:38.549
You realize that you cannot
answer that.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:43.133
You cannot answer that,
even if I promised to move only

00:08:43.133 --> 00:08:46.752
along the x-axis,
because I think--I don't want

00:08:46.752 --> 00:08:49.480
to pose this as a question,
because I think the answer is

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.894
fairly obvious to everybody.
It's not enough to say I went 5

00:08:52.894 --> 00:08:54.670
km.
I've got to tell you whether I

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.169
went to the right or whether I
went to the left.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:01.826
So I could be 10 km from home,
I could be 0 km from home,

00:09:01.826 --> 00:09:05.651
or I could be -10,
if I'd gone two steps to the

00:09:05.651 --> 00:09:08.417
left.
You can deal with this by

00:09:08.417 --> 00:09:12.129
saying not just 5 km,
but plus or minus 5 km.

00:09:12.129 --> 00:09:14.551
If you give a sign,
on top of the number,

00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:17.700
that takes care of all
ambiguity in one dimension.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.387
So the sign of the number is
adequate to keep track of my

00:09:21.387 --> 00:09:23.995
motion.
But in 2D, the options are not

00:09:23.995 --> 00:09:28.227
just left and right or north and
south, but infinity of possible

00:09:28.227 --> 00:09:31.250
directions in which I could go
those 5 km.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.429
What I could do on the first
day is to come here.

00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:38.060
On the second day,
could be to go there.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.539
These two guys are 5 km long.
For that purpose,

00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:47.620
to describe that displacement,
we use a vector.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.027
This is called a vector;
we are going to give it the

00:09:51.027 --> 00:09:53.447
name A.
It starts from the origin and

00:09:53.447 --> 00:09:57.985
goes to this point.
That is a description of what I

00:09:57.985 --> 00:10:01.553
did on the first day.
The second day,

00:10:01.553 --> 00:10:05.973
I did this and that is the
description of what I did on the

00:10:05.973 --> 00:10:08.766
second day.
The proper way to draw a vector

00:10:08.766 --> 00:10:12.330
is to draw an arrow that's got a
beginning and it's got an end.

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:18.938
This is the reason behind
saying a vector has a magnitude

00:10:18.938 --> 00:10:21.659
and a direction.
A magnitude is how long this

00:10:21.659 --> 00:10:24.389
guy is and direction is at what
angle it is.

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:26.669
This is A and this is
B.

00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:30.743
Now, you realize that--By the
way, when you draw a vector like

00:10:30.743 --> 00:10:34.549
A, you're supposed to put
a little arrow on top.

00:10:34.549 --> 00:10:36.847
If you don't put an arrow on
top, it means you're talking

00:10:36.847 --> 00:10:39.193
about just a number A.
It could be positive or

00:10:39.193 --> 00:10:41.293
negative or complex,
but it's just an ordinary

00:10:41.293 --> 00:10:43.562
number.
If you want to talk about an

00:10:43.562 --> 00:10:46.394
arrow of any kind,
you've got to put a little

00:10:46.394 --> 00:10:48.960
arrow on top of it.
In the textbook,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.042
they use boldface arrows.
In the classroom,

00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:54.976
you use this symbol.
This is A and this is

00:10:54.976 --> 00:10:57.655
B.
There's a very natural quantity

00:10:57.655 --> 00:11:00.379
that you can call A +
B.

00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:03.752
If you want to call something
as A + B,

00:11:03.752 --> 00:11:07.320
it means that I did A
and then I did B.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.493
But if I want to do it all in
one shot, what is the equivalent

00:11:11.493 --> 00:11:15.122
step I should take?
It's obvious that the bottom

00:11:15.122 --> 00:11:18.960
line of my two-day trip is this
object C.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.879
We will call that A +
B.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:26.815
It does represent the sum,
in the sense that if I gave you

00:11:26.815 --> 00:11:30.888
four bucks and I gave you five
bucks, I gave you effectively

00:11:30.888 --> 00:11:32.743
nine.
Here, we are not talking about

00:11:32.743 --> 00:11:34.429
a single number,
but a displacement in the

00:11:34.429 --> 00:11:37.251
plane.
C indeed represents an

00:11:37.251 --> 00:11:40.644
effective displacement.
This is the rule for adding

00:11:40.644 --> 00:11:43.975
vectors.
It has an origin in this simple

00:11:43.975 --> 00:11:46.370
example.
Okay, so the rule for adding

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.045
the two vectors is,
you draw the first one and at

00:11:49.045 --> 00:11:52.110
the end of that first one,
you begin the second one.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:57.277
The sum starts at the beginning
of the first and ends at the end

00:11:57.277 --> 00:12:01.506
of the second.
Okay, so that tells you how to

00:12:01.506 --> 00:12:05.759
add two vectors and get a sum.
You can verify,

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:10.219
in this simple example,
that A + B is the

00:12:10.219 --> 00:12:14.367
same as B + A.
B + A would

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:18.049
be--First draw B and from
there you draw A.

00:12:18.049 --> 00:12:19.950
You will end up with the same
point.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.220
You say this is a commutative
law.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.400
It doesn't matter the sequence
in which you add the two

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.959
vectors.
You know that's true for

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:28.970
ordinary numbers,
right?

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:34.090
3 + 4 and 4 + 3 are the same.
It's also true for vectors.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.750
But the law of composition is
not always commutative.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.601
There are certain occasions in
which you first do A and

00:12:39.601 --> 00:12:42.223
then do B;
that's not the same as first

00:12:42.223 --> 00:12:44.700
doing B and then doing
A.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:50.314
We'll come to that later.
Right now, this is the simple

00:12:50.314 --> 00:12:53.300
law.
Alright, next thing I want to

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.930
do is to define the vector that
plays the role of the number 0.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.105
The number 0 has a property.
When you add it to any number,

00:13:03.105 --> 00:13:06.274
it doesn't make a difference.
I want a vector that I want to

00:13:06.274 --> 00:13:09.213
call the 0 vector.
It should have the property

00:13:09.213 --> 00:13:13.059
that when I add it to anybody,
I get the same vector.

00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:16.909
So you can guess who the 0
vector is.

00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:19.620
The 0 vector is a vector of no
length.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.109
If this is A,
I'm going to draw a vector

00:13:23.109 --> 00:13:25.190
here.
I cannot show you the 0 vector.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.580
The minute you can see it,
I'm doing something wrong.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.321
If you can see it,
it's wrong, because it's not

00:13:30.321 --> 00:13:33.849
supposed to have any length.
But it has a property that when

00:13:33.849 --> 00:13:36.600
you add it to anything,
you get the same vector.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.880
So that vector is called a
"null vector."

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:44.650
How about this guy?
I draw A,

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:51.220
then I draw another A.
This is A + A.

00:13:57.919 --> 00:14:01.613
You have to agree that if
there's any vector that deserves

00:14:01.613 --> 00:14:04.270
to be called 2A,
it is this guy.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:08.210
This is A + A.
We're going to call it

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:11.389
2A.
The beauty of that is now we

00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:16.190
have discovered a notion of what
it means to multiply a vector by

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.629
a number.
If you multiply it by 2,

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:20.940
you get a vector two times as
long.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.614
Then you're able to generalize
that and say,

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:29.399
if you multiply it by 2.6,
I mean a vector 2.6 as long as

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:32.408
A.
So multiplying a vector by a

00:14:32.408 --> 00:14:35.120
number means stretch it by that
factor.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.655
Then, I want to think of a
vector that I can call

00:14:39.655 --> 00:14:44.169
-A.
What do I expect of -A?

00:14:44.169 --> 00:14:47.224
I expect that if I add
-A to A,

00:14:47.224 --> 00:14:51.251
I should get the guy who plays
the role of 0 in this world,

00:14:51.251 --> 00:14:53.820
which is the vector of no
length.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.244
It's very clear that if you
want to take A and ask,

00:14:57.244 --> 00:15:00.789
"What should I add to A
so I get the null vector?"

00:15:00.789 --> 00:15:03.463
it's clear that you want to add
a vector that looks like that,

00:15:03.463 --> 00:15:06.005
because then you go from the
start of this to the finish of

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:08.230
that,
you end up at the same point

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.649
and you get this invisible 0
vector.

00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:15.240
So the minus vector is the same
vector flipped over,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.710
pointing the opposite way.
That's like -1 times a vector.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.076
Once you've got that,
you can do minus 7 times a

00:15:22.076 --> 00:15:24.139
vector or –5π times a
vector.

00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:26.724
Just take the vector,
multiply it by 5π and

00:15:26.724 --> 00:15:29.259
flip it over.
That's -5π times a vector.

00:15:29.259 --> 00:15:33.282
This is how you get the rules
for adding a vector to another

00:15:33.282 --> 00:15:37.850
vector, then taking a vector and
multiplying it by some constant.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.438
Then, of course,
you can do more complicated

00:15:40.438 --> 00:15:42.096
things.
You can take this vector,

00:15:42.096 --> 00:15:44.017
multiply it by one number,
take that vector,

00:15:44.017 --> 00:15:46.429
multiply it by another number,
add the two of them.

00:15:46.429 --> 00:15:48.929
We know what all those
operations mean now.

00:15:48.929 --> 00:15:51.879
You don't have to memorize all
this.

00:15:51.879 --> 00:15:54.750
The only rule is,
"do what comes naturally."

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.990
Do what you normally do with
ordinary numbers.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.416
This seems to work for vectors.
You should know what

00:16:00.416 --> 00:16:03.649
multiplying a vector by a number
means.

00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:07.720
So this is the notion of what
vectors are.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.222
Now, we are going to come to
some important concept,

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:16.632
which is the following.
You go back to the same

00:16:16.632 --> 00:16:20.129
xy plane;
here is some vector A.

00:16:20.129 --> 00:16:24.090
I'm going to introduce two very
special vectors.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:28.570
They are called unit vectors.
This guy is I,

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.031
that is J.
If I had a third axis,

00:16:31.031 --> 00:16:33.629
I would draw a K,
but we don't need that.

00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:36.635
So I and J are
vectors of length one,

00:16:36.635 --> 00:16:38.980
pointing along x and
y.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.562
The claim is,
I can write any vector you give

00:16:43.562 --> 00:16:49.500
me as a real scale I plus
a real scale J.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.118
There's nothing you can throw
at me that I cannot handle with

00:16:52.118 --> 00:16:54.649
some multiple of I and
some multiple of J.

00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:58.462
It's intuitively clear,
but I will just prove it beyond

00:16:58.462 --> 00:17:01.019
any doubt.
Here is the vector A.

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:05.407
It is clear that that vector is
the sum of that vector and that

00:17:05.407 --> 00:17:08.380
vector, by the rules of vector
addition,

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.220
because that plus that is equal
to the A.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.927
But how about this part?
This part, being parallel to

00:17:15.927 --> 00:17:18.799
I, has to be a multiple
of I.

00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:21.448
We know that because you can
stretch I by whatever

00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:24.255
factor you like.
So whatever number it takes,

00:17:24.255 --> 00:17:26.980
Ax times I is
this part.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.982
This part, being parallel to
J, has to be some

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:34.160
multiple of J.
I'm going to call it Ay.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.631
Therefore, the vector A
that you gave me,

00:17:37.631 --> 00:17:41.620
I have managed to write as
(I times Ax) +

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.910
(J times Ay).

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.954
You can ask yourself,
"If you gave me a particular

00:17:51.954 --> 00:17:56.069
vector, what do I use for
Ax and Ay?"

00:17:56.069 --> 00:18:01.031
You can see from trigonometry
that if this angle was θ

00:18:01.031 --> 00:18:05.342
here and the length of the
vector I'm going to call by

00:18:05.342 --> 00:18:10.042
A.
A is the length of

00:18:10.042 --> 00:18:12.669
A.
If you drop the arrow,

00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:15.487
it's the usual convention,
if you're talking about the

00:18:15.487 --> 00:18:18.423
length of the vector A.
First of all,

00:18:18.423 --> 00:18:25.473
it's clear from the Pythagoras'
theorem that A is the

00:18:25.473 --> 00:18:31.210
square root of Ax^(2) +
Ay^(2).

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.950
The angle θ that it
makes with the x-axis

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.759
satisfies the condition tan
(θ) is Ay over

00:18:38.759 --> 00:18:39.780
Ax..

00:18:44.819 --> 00:18:47.930
What this means--Now here's the
main point.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.877
If you give me a pair of
numbers, Ax and

00:18:50.877 --> 00:18:54.210
Ay, that's as good as
giving me this arrow,

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.603
because I can find the length
of the arrow by Pythagoras'

00:18:57.603 --> 00:19:00.181
theorem.
And I can find the orientation

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:04.124
of the arrow by saying the angle
θ that satisfies tan

00:19:04.124 --> 00:19:06.950
(θ) is Ay over
Ax.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.373
You have the option of either
working with the two components

00:19:10.373 --> 00:19:13.510
of A or with the arrow.
In practice,

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:18.641
most of the time we work with
these two numbers,

00:19:18.641 --> 00:19:23.680
Ax and Ay.
If you are describing a

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:29.313
particle with location r,
the vector we use typically to

00:19:29.313 --> 00:19:34.226
locate a particle r,
then r is just (I

00:19:34.226 --> 00:19:37.400
times x) + (J
times y),

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.590
because you all know that's
x and that's y.

00:19:46.849 --> 00:19:50.429
I've not given you any other
example besides the displacement

00:19:50.429 --> 00:19:53.529
vector, but at the moment,
we'll define a vector to be any

00:19:53.529 --> 00:19:56.203
object which looks like some
multiple of I plus some

00:19:56.203 --> 00:19:57.310
multiple of J.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.778
Suppose I tell you to add two
vectors, A and B

00:20:06.778 --> 00:20:10.242
equal to C,
and I say, "What's the result

00:20:10.242 --> 00:20:12.970
of adding A and
B?"

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:16.345
You've got two options.
You can draw the arrow

00:20:16.345 --> 00:20:19.416
corresponding to A.
Then, you make an arrow

00:20:19.416 --> 00:20:22.140
corresponding to B and
lay it on the end of this one.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:27.277
Then add them, as shown here.
But you can also do something

00:20:27.277 --> 00:20:32.054
without drawing any pictures.
That would come by saying,

00:20:32.054 --> 00:20:36.719
"I'm taking (I times
Ax) + (J times

00:20:36.719 --> 00:20:41.468
Ay) + (I times
Bx) + (J times

00:20:41.468 --> 00:20:44.585
By),"
and I'm trying to add all these

00:20:44.585 --> 00:20:46.877
guys.
But then, I combine (I

00:20:46.877 --> 00:20:50.269
times Ax) with (I
times Bx),

00:20:50.269 --> 00:20:52.240
because that's the vector
parallel to I,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.688
with the length Ax.
That's the vector parallel to

00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:57.210
I, with length Bx.
That's clear.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.978
If I add them,
I'll get a vector parallel to

00:20:59.978 --> 00:21:02.940
I with lengths Ax
+ Bx.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:08.170
Then Cy = Ay +
By.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.759
I have to be really careful
when I said, "Add the lengths."

00:21:10.759 --> 00:21:12.799
I'm assuming all the components
are positive.

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:15.873
If the Ax and Ay,
some are positive and some are

00:21:15.873 --> 00:21:18.846
negative, this is the way by
which we have learned we should

00:21:18.846 --> 00:21:22.049
combine multiples of I.
When I give you multiple of

00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:25.470
I and another multiple of
I, there's some has got

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.450
as its coefficient the sum of
the two coefficients.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.811
This says, when you add two
vectors, you just add the

00:21:31.811 --> 00:21:35.625
components, so that if this
vector is called (I times

00:21:35.625 --> 00:21:38.470
Cx) + (J times
Cy),

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:43.774
then it's worth knowing that
Cx is (Ax +

00:21:43.774 --> 00:21:49.180
Bx) and Cy is
(Ay + By).

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.824
Most of the time,
when we deal with vectors,

00:21:52.824 --> 00:21:55.960
we don't draw these arrows
anymore.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.958
We just keep a pair of numbers.
If you give me another vector,

00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:00.210
there's another pair of
numbers.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:03.396
If you say, "Add the vectors,"
I would just add the x to

00:22:03.396 --> 00:22:06.479
the x and the y to
the y and I'm keeping

00:22:06.479 --> 00:22:11.410
track of what the sum is.
A very important result is that

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:16.960
if two vectors are equal,
if A = B,

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.777
the only way it can happen is
if separately Ax is equal

00:22:20.777 --> 00:22:23.970
to Bx and Ay is
equal to By.

00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:31.319
That's the very important
difference.

00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:34.239
You cannot have two vectors
equal without exactly the same

00:22:34.239 --> 00:22:36.492
x component,
exactly the same y

00:22:36.492 --> 00:22:38.130
component.
That's pretty obvious.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.618
If two arrows are equal,
you cannot be longer in the

00:22:40.618 --> 00:22:43.057
x direction and
correspondingly short in the

00:22:43.057 --> 00:22:45.531
y direction.
Everything has to completely

00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:47.799
match.
Vector equation A =

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:51.660
B is actually a shorthand
for two equations.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.710
The x parts match and
the y parts match.

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:02.888
Now, when you work with
components, Ax and

00:23:02.888 --> 00:23:05.009
Ay, if I didn't mention
it,

00:23:05.009 --> 00:23:09.511
they are the components of the
vector, you can do all your

00:23:09.511 --> 00:23:13.460
bookkeeping in terms of
Ax and Ay.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.940
But you've got to be aware of
one fact.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.533
If I just come and say to you,
"Here's the vector whose

00:23:20.533 --> 00:23:24.510
components are 3 and 5.
Can you draw the vector for me?"

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.910
Can you draw it or not?
Does anybody have a view?

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.560
Yes?
No?

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.670
Yes?
Pardon me?

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:38.453
Yeah, if you immediately said,
"Well, if the vector is 3,4,

00:23:38.453 --> 00:23:41.339
then the vector looks like
this,"

00:23:41.339 --> 00:23:45.341
you're making the assumption
that I am writing the vector in

00:23:45.341 --> 00:23:48.501
terms of I and J.
You see, I and J

00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:50.297
is very natural direction.
For most of us,

00:23:50.297 --> 00:23:53.520
gravity acts this way,
defines a vertical direction

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.259
very naturally and the
blackboard is oriented this way,

00:23:57.259 --> 00:24:00.803
so very natural to call that x
and call that y and line up our

00:24:00.803 --> 00:24:02.947
axes.
But you agree that there is no

00:24:02.947 --> 00:24:05.958
reason why somebody else
couldn't come along and say,

00:24:05.958 --> 00:24:08.507
"You know what,
I want to use a different set

00:24:08.507 --> 00:24:11.379
of axes.
Those directions are more

00:24:11.379 --> 00:24:14.766
natural for me."
In fact, just because the world

00:24:14.766 --> 00:24:17.906
is round, you can already see if
this is the Earth,

00:24:17.906 --> 00:24:20.670
to somebody that's the natural
direction.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:22.365
If you go to another
neighboring country,

00:24:22.365 --> 00:24:24.910
that's what they think is
naturally x and y.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:28.260
There is no reason why x
and y are nailed in

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.406
absolute space.
It's very important that

00:24:30.406 --> 00:24:33.369
x and y are human
constructs and we're not wedded

00:24:33.369 --> 00:24:34.763
to any of them.
Quite often,

00:24:34.763 --> 00:24:37.386
it's natural to pick x
and y in a certain way,

00:24:37.386 --> 00:24:39.519
because starting a projectile
near the Earth,

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:41.814
it makes sense to pick the
horizontal as x and

00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:43.707
vertical as y.
Mathematically,

00:24:43.707 --> 00:24:46.745
you don't have to.
Very important point that comes

00:24:46.745 --> 00:24:51.996
up is the following.
What if somebody comes along

00:24:51.996 --> 00:24:57.140
and has got a new axis?
Here is the unit vector

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.355
I prime,
that's unit vector J

00:25:00.355 --> 00:25:03.569
prime and here is this vector
A.

00:25:03.569 --> 00:25:07.802
And the angle between my axis,
let's say, and your axis is

00:25:07.802 --> 00:25:09.510
some angle φ.

00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:19.496
The same vector A can be
written either in terms of

00:25:19.496 --> 00:25:24.447
I and J or in
terms of I prime and

00:25:24.447 --> 00:25:27.621
J prime.
Let's take a minute to just

00:25:27.621 --> 00:25:30.597
play this game of asking.
How do the components of

00:25:30.597 --> 00:25:34.457
A in the new rotated
coordinate system relate to the

00:25:34.457 --> 00:25:37.319
components of the old coordinate
system?

00:25:37.319 --> 00:25:40.144
It's a simple problem,
but I just want to do it so you

00:25:40.144 --> 00:25:42.009
get used to working with
vectors.

00:25:42.009 --> 00:25:46.565
The point is the arrow
A, somebody has chosen to

00:25:46.565 --> 00:25:51.879
write in terms of I prime
and J prime as Ax

00:25:51.879 --> 00:25:55.519
prime and Ay prime.
Do you guys follow that?

00:25:55.519 --> 00:25:58.111
I prime and J
prime are now rotated unit

00:25:58.111 --> 00:26:00.113
vectors.
And somebody wants to think in

00:26:00.113 --> 00:26:01.614
terms of those.
In other words,

00:26:01.614 --> 00:26:04.020
the person wants to ask,
"How much I prime and

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.565
how much J prime do I
need to build up the vector

00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.271
A?"
That person will get a

00:26:08.271 --> 00:26:09.781
different answer.
You're asking,

00:26:09.781 --> 00:26:12.800
"How much I and how much
J do I need to build the

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.490
same object?"
The same entity written in two

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.386
different ways.
If she's got a pair of numbers

00:26:18.386 --> 00:26:22.139
and you got a pair of numbers,
the new numbers are called the

00:26:22.139 --> 00:26:26.080
primed numbers and you want to
write them in terms of yours.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.616
For that, what do you need?
You need to know what I

00:26:29.616 --> 00:26:32.059
prime is in terms of I
and J.

00:26:32.059 --> 00:26:34.230
Let's draw a little picture on
the side here.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:38.174
This is I prime.
It's got a length 1,

00:26:38.174 --> 00:26:42.579
it's at an angle φ.
I'm going to write something

00:26:42.579 --> 00:26:46.392
and I'll wait until you guys
tell me you're comfortable with

00:26:46.392 --> 00:26:49.685
this.
I prime is I cos

00:26:49.685 --> 00:26:54.029
φ + J sin
φ.

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:57.562
There should not be anybody in
this room who is mystified by

00:26:57.562 --> 00:27:00.674
this statement.
This vector I prime has

00:27:00.674 --> 00:27:03.606
got a horizontal part,
which is its length,

00:27:03.606 --> 00:27:07.962
which is 1 times cos φ,
and a vertical part which is 1

00:27:07.962 --> 00:27:11.037
times sin φ.
This kind of trigonometry you

00:27:11.037 --> 00:27:13.909
should know all the time.
It's not something you're going

00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:15.883
to go back and remember it's an
opposite side,

00:27:15.883 --> 00:27:18.571
it's an adjacent side.
You've got to know that really

00:27:18.571 --> 00:27:20.370
well.
You've got to be very used to

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:23.330
the notion of taking a vector in
some oblique direction and

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.780
writing it in terms of I
and J.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.750
How about J prime?
J prime is pointing in

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:34.190
that direction.
It's at an angle φ.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:41.696
So J prime will be
-I sin φ +

00:27:41.696 --> 00:27:46.489
J cos φ.
If it's not obvious,

00:27:46.489 --> 00:27:49.347
I think this is the kind of
thing you should fill in the

00:27:49.347 --> 00:27:52.200
blanks when you go home.
Leave a line there and think

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.220
about it and fill in the blanks
later.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.286
It's very important to know if
these two axes are at angle

00:27:57.286 --> 00:28:00.299
φ, those two axes are
also at angle φ.

00:28:00.299 --> 00:28:02.960
That's the result you use all
the time in mechanics.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.509
Once you do that,
I think it's fairly clear that

00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:08.764
it has got a y component
that's given by cosine and an

00:28:08.764 --> 00:28:11.640
x component that's given
by sin φ;

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.250
the x component is
negative.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:16.789
This vector has a little bit of
negative I in it.

00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:19.369
Here is what I'd say you should
do.

00:28:19.369 --> 00:28:21.680
This is the kind of thing I
don't want to do in classroom.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.470
It takes time and I'm probably
going to screw up.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:29.424
Imagine taking I prime
and J prime and stick

00:28:29.424 --> 00:28:33.707
them here and here.
Do this in your head and ask,

00:28:33.707 --> 00:28:37.178
"What can I possibly get?
I prime and J

00:28:37.178 --> 00:28:40.166
prime have been banished.
Everywhere they're replaced by

00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:43.593
I and J.
You can now collect the whole

00:28:43.593 --> 00:28:46.882
expression as something
something I plus

00:28:46.882 --> 00:28:52.753
something something J.
What you will get for I

00:28:52.753 --> 00:28:59.799
will be Ax cos φ
- Ay sin φ.

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:04.230
Then, here you will get
Ay cos φ +

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.630
Ax sin φ.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.869
This is the only part I don't
want to do explicitly.

00:29:14.869 --> 00:29:17.055
I'm just saying,
"Take this and put it there and

00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:21.474
combine I and J."
But this is the same vector we

00:29:21.474 --> 00:29:26.763
are calling (I times
Ax) + (J times

00:29:26.763 --> 00:29:28.774
Ay).
I've told you,

00:29:28.774 --> 00:29:31.290
if two vectors are equal,
the components must match.

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:34.920
I may then--I'm sorry.
I'm making a mistake here.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:40.718
This should be prime.
By the way, when you guys do

00:29:40.718 --> 00:29:46.485
this, did anybody notice prime?
If you noticed it,

00:29:46.485 --> 00:29:49.846
you got to stop.
You cannot let me write

00:29:49.846 --> 00:29:53.211
anything that's incorrect.
You got to follow it in some

00:29:53.211 --> 00:29:54.714
detail.
I know you couldn't do the

00:29:54.714 --> 00:29:57.281
details, but you should at least
know that it's I prime

00:29:57.281 --> 00:29:59.680
and J prime that have
been replaced by I and

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.524
J.
But Ax prime and

00:30:01.524 --> 00:30:04.470
Ay prime will continue to
be the coefficients.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:11.940
So if I make a comparison,
I find Ax = Ax

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:19.410
prime cos φ - Ay
prime sin φ and

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:28.126
Ay = -Ax prime sin
φ + Ay prime cos

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:31.782
φ.
What's the purpose of the

00:30:31.782 --> 00:30:34.843
exercise?
The purpose of the exercise is

00:30:34.843 --> 00:30:37.990
to make the following precise
remark.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:42.038
You can pick your unit vectors,
or what are called basis

00:30:42.038 --> 00:30:45.586
vectors, any way you like.
Pick any two perpendicular

00:30:45.586 --> 00:30:49.186
directions which may be related
to the ones I picked by an angle

00:30:49.186 --> 00:30:51.398
φ.
Then the same entity,

00:30:51.398 --> 00:30:54.755
the same arrow which has an
existence of its own,

00:30:54.755 --> 00:30:58.251
independent of axes,
can be described by you and me

00:30:58.251 --> 00:31:01.913
using different numbers.
There's a precise connection

00:31:01.913 --> 00:31:04.890
between the numbers you use and
the numbers I use.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:09.104
Your numbers with the primes on
them are related to mine by this

00:31:09.104 --> 00:31:12.866
relation.
Now, you can ask the opposite

00:31:12.866 --> 00:31:16.572
question.
How do I get your numbers in

00:31:16.572 --> 00:31:24.290
terms of my numbers?
What should I do?

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:27.346
They won't invert the relation.
Anybody have an idea of what I

00:31:27.346 --> 00:31:27.970
should do now?

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:44.120
No one has a clue on how I can
go back from these to that?

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:48.967
Let me take a second to ask.
Do you have any idea what you

00:31:48.967 --> 00:31:51.960
should do?
Okay, maybe you are--yes?

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:59.264
Student:
[inaudible]

00:31:59.264 --> 00:32:12.186
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Negative of

00:32:12.186 --> 00:32:16.590
φ?
Yes.

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:19.173
Okay.
His idea was,

00:32:19.173 --> 00:32:24.284
the formula written for the
opposite one will have the

00:32:24.284 --> 00:32:28.004
opposite angle;
he replaces φ by minus

00:32:28.004 --> 00:32:29.998
of that.
That turns out to be the

00:32:29.998 --> 00:32:32.724
correct answer.
But I want you guys to think

00:32:32.724 --> 00:32:35.735
about why it was difficult to do
it another way,

00:32:35.735 --> 00:32:39.853
which is more pedestrian.
If I told you 3x +

00:32:39.853 --> 00:32:43.849
2y = 9 and 4x +
6y = 6,

00:32:43.849 --> 00:32:49.147
you certainly know how to solve
for x and y,

00:32:49.147 --> 00:32:52.634
right?
This is something you've seen

00:32:52.634 --> 00:32:55.956
in your high school.
You've got to juggle the two

00:32:55.956 --> 00:32:58.644
equations, multiply that by 4,
multiply that by 3,

00:32:58.644 --> 00:33:01.925
add and subtract and so on.
Why is it when you saw this,

00:33:01.925 --> 00:33:04.380
you didn't realize it's the
same problem?

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.390
It's the same problem;
φ is the angle,

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.440
sine and cosine are definite
numbers.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.027
If I pick an angle of 60%,
these are some numbers like

00:33:13.027 --> 00:33:17.104
half and root 3 over 2.
I'm trying to write these two

00:33:17.104 --> 00:33:21.872
unknowns in terms of these two
knowns and you can solve for

00:33:21.872 --> 00:33:23.236
them.
Here though,

00:33:23.236 --> 00:33:26.299
what you multiply by would be
sine φs and cos

00:33:26.299 --> 00:33:28.420
φs, so you can
eliminate.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.244
For example,
if you multiply this by sin φ

00:33:31.244 --> 00:33:34.404
and multiply this by cos
φ and add them,

00:33:34.404 --> 00:33:36.960
the Ax prime will drop
off.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.329
That's the kind of thing you
should do.

00:33:39.329 --> 00:33:43.280
Maybe I will add this on as a
problem you should do in your

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.634
homework.
Do you realize that this is a

00:33:46.634 --> 00:33:52.202
pair of simultaneous equations
in which you can solve for these

00:33:52.202 --> 00:33:54.215
two unknowns,
if you like,

00:33:54.215 --> 00:33:56.663
in terms of these two knowns
and these coefficients,

00:33:56.663 --> 00:34:00.579
which are like these numbers,
3,2, 4, and 6?

00:34:00.579 --> 00:34:03.155
You can do that,
but we like to get the answer

00:34:03.155 --> 00:34:05.329
the way this gentleman described
it,

00:34:05.329 --> 00:34:08.807
because we like to get an
answer more readily than by

00:34:08.807 --> 00:34:12.245
doing the mundane work.
The idea that he had was,

00:34:12.245 --> 00:34:15.846
if you go from me to you,
with a clockwise rotation,

00:34:15.846 --> 00:34:19.800
you go from you to me by a
counterclockwise rotation.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:25.722
Therefore, if I go by φ
to you, then you must go by

00:34:25.722 --> 00:34:29.429
-φ to come to me.
That's correct.

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:34.299
You will find then the result
is Ax cos φ +

00:34:34.299 --> 00:34:38.360
Ay sin φ.
I'm using the fact that when

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.041
you take a cosine and change the
angle inside the cosine,

00:34:42.041 --> 00:34:44.773
it doesn't care;
whereas, if you go to the sine

00:34:44.773 --> 00:34:47.789
and change the angle inside the
sine, it becomes minus sine.

00:34:47.789 --> 00:34:51.327
In other words,
sine of minus φ is

00:34:51.327 --> 00:34:56.072
minus sin φ and cosine
of minus θ is cos

00:34:56.072 --> 00:34:58.121
φ.
This, by the way,

00:34:58.121 --> 00:35:01.090
is another property I expect
people to know in this course.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:03.010
You cannot say,
"I never heard of it.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:04.909
I don't know where it came
from."

00:35:04.909 --> 00:35:06.240
You should think about why that
is true.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.530
If you do that,
you will find this result.

00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:30.027
So, there is a way to go from
the unprimed coordinates to the

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:34.967
prime coordinate by rotating
your axis and actually

00:35:34.967 --> 00:35:40.298
calculating the components.
Now, here is a very important

00:35:40.298 --> 00:35:44.521
message, which is the following.
When you go from one set of

00:35:44.521 --> 00:35:47.500
axes to another set of axes,
the numbers change.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.670
The components of the vector
are not the same.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.420
You might think it's all along
x and somebody can tell

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.300
me it's all along my new
y axis.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.699
So the components of vector are
not invariant.

00:35:56.699 --> 00:35:58.949
They depend on who is looking
at the vector.

00:35:58.949 --> 00:36:03.161
There's one quantity that's
going to come out the same,

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:06.360
no matter who is looking at the
vector.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.690
Anybody have a guess?
Yes?

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:10.441
Student:
[inaudible]

00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:11.943
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: The length of the

00:36:11.943 --> 00:36:13.070
vector is the length of the
vector.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.719
Perhaps it's clear to you that
no matter how your axes are

00:36:15.719 --> 00:36:18.090
oriented, when you ask,
"How long is this arrow?"

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.070
you are going to get the same
answer.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:26.560
That means Ax^(2) +
Ay^(2) = Ax prime

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.659
squared + Ay prime
squared.

00:36:30.659 --> 00:36:32.500
That's a property of this
expression.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.832
You can square this guy and add
it to the square of this guy and

00:36:35.832 --> 00:36:37.525
you will find,
using the magic of

00:36:37.525 --> 00:36:39.429
trigonometry,
that this is true.

00:36:39.429 --> 00:36:42.273
I'm going over these points,
because they're very,

00:36:42.273 --> 00:36:44.519
very important.
When we do relativity,

00:36:44.519 --> 00:36:47.782
we'll be dealing with vectors
in space-time and we'll find

00:36:47.782 --> 00:36:50.759
that different observers
disagree on what is this and

00:36:50.759 --> 00:36:53.929
what is this.
But they will agree on certain

00:36:53.929 --> 00:36:55.739
things.
Yes?

00:36:55.739 --> 00:36:57.748
Student:
[inaudible]

00:36:57.748 --> 00:37:01.070
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Here?

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:01.921
Student:
[inaudible]

00:37:01.921 --> 00:37:03.329
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Here?

00:37:03.329 --> 00:37:04.447
Student:
[inaudible]

00:37:04.447 --> 00:37:06.638
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: This has a minus

00:37:06.638 --> 00:37:08.743
and that doesn't have a minus.
Student:

00:37:08.743 --> 00:37:10.158
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:37:10.158 --> 00:37:11.230
Shankar: Oh,
here?

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.957
Student:
[inaudible]

00:37:11.957 --> 00:37:13.019
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

00:37:13.019 --> 00:37:14.389
here both are plus,
but this one has a minus.

00:37:14.389 --> 00:37:15.298
Student:
[inaudible]

00:37:15.298 --> 00:37:16.626
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh,

00:37:16.626 --> 00:37:18.230
I'm so sorry.
Yes.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.640
That is correct.
Thank you.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.800
That's right.
The minus is only up there.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.582
Very good.
Certain things are called

00:37:29.582 --> 00:37:31.733
invariants.
This is an example of an

00:37:31.733 --> 00:37:35.558
invariant.
By the way, I want to conclude

00:37:35.558 --> 00:37:39.908
with one important point.
We learned that a vector is a

00:37:39.908 --> 00:37:42.449
quantity that has a magnitude
and a direction.

00:37:42.449 --> 00:37:47.632
Actually, the view of vectors
we take nowadays is that vectors

00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:51.539
are associated with a pair of
numbers which,

00:37:51.539 --> 00:37:55.150
on the rotation of axes,
transform like this.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:57.760
Anything that transforms this
way is called a vector.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:03.180
Now, I want to ask the
following question.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:09.096
Can I manufacture new vectors?
We've got one vector which is

00:38:09.096 --> 00:38:11.130
r.
How about more vectors?

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.440
More position vectors?
I want to look at that.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.342
That turns out to be a very
nice way to produce vectors,

00:38:18.342 --> 00:38:21.180
given one vector,
the position vector.

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.230
And that's the following.
Let's take a particle that is

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:30.930
moving in the xy plane,
so that at one instance--sorry,

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:36.070
let me change this graph-- is
here--oh, this is bad.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.910
Let's see.
It's moving like this.

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:45.000
I'm here now.
A little later, I am there.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.559
That's what I meant.
This is called r.

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:53.420
This is called Δr,
this is called r +

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.541
Δr.
The particle is moving along

00:38:57.541 --> 00:39:02.418
this arc.
Initially, its location as a

00:39:02.418 --> 00:39:10.116
function of time is equal to
I times x(t) +

00:39:10.116 --> 00:39:14.240
J times y(t).

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:23.533
You wait a short amount of
time, it goes to a new location,

00:39:23.533 --> 00:39:27.590
which I'm going to call
r(t) + Δt.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:31.408
What can that be?
It can be x(t) plus some

00:39:31.408 --> 00:39:35.876
change in x plus J
times y(t) plus a change

00:39:35.876 --> 00:39:36.940
in y.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:47.033
That, we recognize to be
r(t) plus everything

00:39:47.033 --> 00:39:51.913
else, which is I times
Δx + J times

00:39:51.913 --> 00:39:55.987
Δy.
I'm going to call this guy a

00:39:55.987 --> 00:39:59.195
tiny vector Δr.
In other words,

00:39:59.195 --> 00:40:01.700
when you move on a line,
you wait a small time

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.657
Δt.
You move by an unknown

00:40:03.657 --> 00:40:06.159
Δx.
When you move in the plane,

00:40:06.159 --> 00:40:08.500
your change is,
itself, a vector.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.123
You start with a vector,
you change by this vector

00:40:11.123 --> 00:40:13.889
Δr.
It gives you the new location.

00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:16.079
Δr has got two
components.

00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:18.440
It's got a change in x
and it's got a change in

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.367
y.
Therefore, we will define

00:40:21.367 --> 00:40:25.558
what's called the velocity
vector, which is,

00:40:25.558 --> 00:40:30.140
if you want the limit as
Δt goes to 0 of

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:35.958
Δr over Δt,
and you can see that is going

00:40:35.958 --> 00:40:41.634
to be I times dx
over dt + J times

00:40:41.634 --> 00:40:46.377
dy over dt,
you can actually take

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:49.940
derivatives of a vector with
time.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.280
That's also a vector.
Why is the derivative of a

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.757
vector also a vector?
Because the difference in the

00:40:55.757 --> 00:40:57.809
vector between two times is its
vector.

00:40:57.809 --> 00:41:00.917
Dividing by Δt is like
multiplying by 1 over

00:41:00.917 --> 00:41:03.061
Δt.
But I know when I multiply a

00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:05.232
vector by a number,
I get a vector in the same

00:41:05.232 --> 00:41:07.956
direction.
What this really means is that

00:41:07.956 --> 00:41:11.239
if you take the limit as
Δt goes to 0,

00:41:11.239 --> 00:41:14.386
I cannot draw it that well,
but imagine bringing the second

00:41:14.386 --> 00:41:16.719
point closer and closer to the
first one.

00:41:16.719 --> 00:41:18.310
Δr is getting very
small;

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:21.531
Δt is very small.
But by the miracle of calculus,

00:41:21.531 --> 00:41:23.579
the ratio will approach a
definite limit.

00:41:23.579 --> 00:41:27.507
That limit will be some arrow
we can call the velocity at the

00:41:27.507 --> 00:41:30.780
time and it will always be
tangent to the curve.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.640
The tangent's pointing towards
the direction you are headed at

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.646
that instant.
If I gave you the location of a

00:41:37.646 --> 00:41:41.560
particle as a function of time,
you can find the velocity by

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.974
taking derivatives.
For example,

00:41:43.974 --> 00:41:48.905
if I say a particle's location
is I times t^(2) +

00:41:48.905 --> 00:41:52.722
J times 9t^(3),
for every value of time,

00:41:52.722 --> 00:41:55.798
you can put the numbers in and
you can find the velocity by

00:41:55.798 --> 00:41:59.112
just taking derivatives.
The derivative of this guy will

00:41:59.112 --> 00:42:01.480
be 2t times I plus
what?

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:06.137
27t^(2) times J.
Rule for taking derivatives,

00:42:06.137 --> 00:42:09.431
if you want to do this mindless
application of calculus,

00:42:09.431 --> 00:42:11.735
you can do it.
I and J are

00:42:11.735 --> 00:42:13.361
constant;
ignore them when you take

00:42:13.361 --> 00:42:15.065
derivatives;
x and y are

00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:17.700
dependent on time.
Just take the derivatives and

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:21.199
that's the velocity vector.
You can take a derivative of

00:42:21.199 --> 00:42:24.760
the derivative and you can get
the acceleration vector,

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.222
will be d^(2)r over
dt^(2),

00:42:29.222 --> 00:42:35.470
and you can also write it as
dv over dt.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:45.810
Anybody have a question with
what I've done now or what we're

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.433
doing here?
Let me summarize what I'm

00:42:48.433 --> 00:42:50.889
saying.
Particle's moving in a plane.

00:42:50.889 --> 00:42:53.428
At every instant,
it's got a location given by

00:42:53.428 --> 00:42:56.419
the vector r;
r itself is contained in

00:42:56.419 --> 00:42:58.676
a pair of numbers,
x and y,

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:01.654
and they vary with time.
When you vary time a little bit

00:43:01.654 --> 00:43:03.389
and ask, "How does r
change?"

00:43:03.389 --> 00:43:06.538
and you take the quotient of
Δr to Δt,

00:43:06.538 --> 00:43:09.204
you get the velocity vector.
Mathematically,

00:43:09.204 --> 00:43:12.155
it's done by taking the
expression for r and

00:43:12.155 --> 00:43:15.753
differentiating everything in
sight that can be differentiated

00:43:15.753 --> 00:43:18.966
as vector t.
Even though we started with a

00:43:18.966 --> 00:43:21.630
single vector,
which is the position vector,

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:25.285
we're now finding out that its
derivative has to be a vector

00:43:25.285 --> 00:43:28.940
and the derivative of the
derivative is also a vector.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.807
Again, when you learn the
relativity, you will find out

00:43:31.807 --> 00:43:34.090
there's one vector that's
staring at you.

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:36.485
I'll come to what that is.
That's the analog of the

00:43:36.485 --> 00:43:39.153
position vector.
But more and more vectors can

00:43:39.153 --> 00:43:41.820
be manufactured by taking
derivatives.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:48.902
Now, I want to do one concrete
problem where you will see how

00:43:48.902 --> 00:43:53.465
to use these derivatives.
I'm going to write the

00:43:53.465 --> 00:43:56.780
particular case of r(t)
and take derivatives.

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.980
We'll get a feeling for what's
going on.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.969
The problem I have in mind
looks like this.

00:44:01.969 --> 00:44:08.521
r(t) is going to be a
fixed number r times

00:44:08.521 --> 00:44:15.464
I times cos&gt;
ωt + J times

00:44:15.464 --> 00:44:18.900
ωt.
ω is a new creature.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.700
You don't know what it is right
now.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.071
I'm going to just put that in.
ω times t is

00:44:24.071 --> 00:44:27.636
some number and it's the cosine
of the number times I

00:44:27.636 --> 00:44:31.079
plus sine of the number times
J times r.

00:44:31.079 --> 00:44:34.460
What is going on as a function
of time?

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:37.824
What's this particle doing?
First thing you can tell is

00:44:37.824 --> 00:44:41.634
that if you find the length of
this vector, you'll find the

00:44:41.634 --> 00:44:45.380
square of the x and the
square of the y.

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.843
But since sine square plus
cosine square is 1,

00:44:47.843 --> 00:44:50.800
you'll find this vector has a
fixed length r.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:54.803
That means, it can only be
rattling around in a circle of

00:44:54.803 --> 00:45:00.443
radius r.
In fact, what the guy is doing

00:45:00.443 --> 00:45:04.850
looks like this.
At any given time t,

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:08.660
draw an angle ω
t and a radius r

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.320
and that's where your particle
is.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.949
Do you see that?
Because the x component

00:45:14.949 --> 00:45:18.800
of this one is r cos
ω t and the y

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:23.280
part is r sin ωt.
ω is a fixed number.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.219
As t increases,
this angle increases and the

00:45:26.219 --> 00:45:29.572
particle goes round and round.
We're describing the motion of

00:45:29.572 --> 00:45:35.107
a particle in a circle.
Let's understand what ω

00:45:35.107 --> 00:45:37.212
is.
Let's get a feeling for

00:45:37.212 --> 00:45:39.251
ω.
As time increases,

00:45:39.251 --> 00:45:43.660
the angle increases and we can
ask, "How long does it take for

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:47.420
the particle to come back to the
starting point?"

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:50.510
Suppose the starting point was
here.

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:54.402
As I increase t,
ωt will increase,

00:45:54.402 --> 00:45:57.889
and I want to come back to
where I start.

00:45:57.889 --> 00:46:02.659
You've got to ask yourself,
let the time it takes to do a

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:07.429
full circle, that's the time
period, do a full circle.

00:46:07.429 --> 00:46:10.889
What can you say about
ωt?

00:46:10.889 --> 00:46:12.780
What should be the value of
ωt?

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:13.668
Student:
[inaudible]

00:46:13.668 --> 00:46:15.309
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Very good.

00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:18.030
You can say it's 360 degrees,
that's fine.

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:20.610
But we like to measure angle in
radians.

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.800
How many people know about
radians?

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.014
Okay.
For those who have not seen a

00:46:26.014 --> 00:46:29.653
radian, it's just another way to
measure angle with the

00:46:29.653 --> 00:46:32.079
understanding that a full
circle,

00:46:32.079 --> 00:46:37.377
which we used to think is 360
degrees, is equal to 2π

00:46:37.377 --> 00:46:40.530
radians.
2π is roughly 6.

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.080
So a radian is roughly 60
degrees.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.106
It's 58 and a fraction.
Why do you like to measure

00:46:47.106 --> 00:46:50.411
angle in the peculiar way?
You will see the advantages of

00:46:50.411 --> 00:46:52.946
that later.
We'll adapt the convention that

00:46:52.946 --> 00:46:56.650
we'll measure angle in a radian.
So that a half circle,

00:46:56.650 --> 00:47:00.969
instead of calling it 180
degrees, we will call it just

00:47:00.969 --> 00:47:03.037
π.
And a quarter circle,

00:47:03.037 --> 00:47:05.190
instead of 90,
we will call it π over

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:07.489
2 and call it as π over
4 and so on.

00:47:07.489 --> 00:47:10.590
It's good to know certain
famous angles.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.483
This is π over 2,
this is π,

00:47:13.483 --> 00:47:17.519
this is 3π over 2,
and this is back to 2π.

00:47:17.519 --> 00:47:21.202
Therefore, ωt =
2π tells you that

00:47:21.202 --> 00:47:26.035
ω is 2π divided
by the time it takes to complete

00:47:26.035 --> 00:47:29.789
a revolution.
One over the time period is

00:47:29.789 --> 00:47:34.779
what we call the frequency,
so you can write it as--f is

00:47:34.779 --> 00:47:40.179
just the usual frequency.
60 Hertz means you do 60

00:47:40.179 --> 00:47:44.429
revolutions per second.
Alright.

00:47:44.429 --> 00:47:50.020
How fast is this particle
moving?

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:54.395
It's going around a circle.
The angle is increasing at a

00:47:54.395 --> 00:47:57.550
steady rate, so we know it's
going at a steady speed.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:01.578
I'm asking what's the
tangential speed as it moves

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:03.929
along the circle?
Yes?

00:48:03.929 --> 00:48:04.897
Student:
[inaudible]

00:48:04.897 --> 00:48:06.795
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: How do you reach

00:48:06.795 --> 00:48:08.777
that conclusion?
Student:

00:48:08.777 --> 00:48:11.501
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:48:11.501 --> 00:48:15.709
Shankar: I agree,
but I want the speed in meters

00:48:15.709 --> 00:48:18.940
per second.
ω will be in radians

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.570
per second.
Yes?

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:21.425
Student:
[inaudible]

00:48:21.425 --> 00:48:23.203
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: And how did you get

00:48:23.203 --> 00:48:24.991
that?
Student:

00:48:24.991 --> 00:48:28.272
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:30.969
Shankar: Okay.
That's correct.

00:48:30.969 --> 00:48:33.000
But let me deduce that in
another way.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.720
Your answer is completely
correct.

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.039
It is ωr.
I want to say how you get it.

00:48:38.039 --> 00:48:41.535
One way is to say,
if I do a full revolution,

00:48:41.535 --> 00:48:45.269
I think of the speed as a
distance over time.

00:48:45.269 --> 00:48:47.360
I'm going to go one full
revolution.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.369
The distance I travel is
2πr.

00:48:50.369 --> 00:48:55.380
But 2π over t
was identified as ω.

00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:00.951
So the tangential velocity at
any point is equal to ω

00:49:00.951 --> 00:49:05.172
times r.
That's a useful quantity to

00:49:05.172 --> 00:49:07.681
know.
Now, you can take this

00:49:07.681 --> 00:49:11.000
velocity, you can take this
r.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.207
Let me find V(t).
V(t) is obtained by

00:49:17.207 --> 00:49:19.659
taking derivative of this
expression.

00:49:19.659 --> 00:49:25.766
I think you guys know enough
calculus for me to write is

00:49:25.766 --> 00:49:32.094
equal to r times I
times minus ω sin

00:49:32.094 --> 00:49:35.706
ωt,
plus J times ω

00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:36.780
cos ωt.

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.389
That is the velocity of this
guy.

00:49:44.389 --> 00:49:47.580
I invite you to try this
formula whenever you want.

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:51.525
Pick a time.
Let's say, if I go a quarter of

00:49:51.525 --> 00:49:55.349
a circle, I expect to be moving
to the left.

00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:58.400
A quarter of a circle means
ωt is π over 2.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:02.360
Cosine of π over 2 is
0, because cos 90 is 0;

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:06.182
sin of π over 2 is 1
and I get a speed of ωr

00:50:06.182 --> 00:50:08.580
in the negative I
direction.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:11.556
ωr was the speed.
That's indeed the correct

00:50:11.556 --> 00:50:13.773
answer.
You can satisfy yourself at

00:50:13.773 --> 00:50:16.119
various times as going like
this.

00:50:16.119 --> 00:50:19.360
Let's sneak in one more
derivative here,

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.680
which is to take the derivative
of the derivative.

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.311
That's a very important result.
To do that, let's take one more

00:50:28.311 --> 00:50:30.865
derivative.
Let's try to do part of it in

00:50:30.865 --> 00:50:33.239
the head, so I can just write
down the answer.

00:50:33.239 --> 00:50:36.131
If you take one more
derivative, the sine is going to

00:50:36.131 --> 00:50:38.690
become a cosine and yield
another ω.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:42.326
This cosine is going to become
a minus sine and give me another

00:50:42.326 --> 00:50:44.369
ω.
If you do that,

00:50:44.369 --> 00:50:49.905
you will find the whole answer
is equal to -ω^(2) times

00:50:49.905 --> 00:50:55.484
just the vector r itself.
That's a very interesting

00:50:55.484 --> 00:50:58.047
result.
It tells you when a particle

00:50:58.047 --> 00:51:00.905
moves in a circle,
it has an acceleration in a

00:51:00.905 --> 00:51:04.398
negative r direction,
namely directed towards the

00:51:04.398 --> 00:51:07.559
center.
What's the magnitude of that

00:51:07.559 --> 00:51:10.339
acceleration?
I write it without an arrow

00:51:10.339 --> 00:51:12.510
here.
That's equal to ω^(2)

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:16.150
times a magnitude of this
vector, which is just r.

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:23.090
But now, I can also write it as
v^(2) over r.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:28.847
Here, ready?
This is a very important

00:51:28.847 --> 00:51:31.420
formula.
I don't know how many kids,

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:35.717
generation after generation,
get in trouble because they do

00:51:35.717 --> 00:51:39.948
not remember the following fact.
I'm going to say it once more

00:51:39.948 --> 00:51:42.590
with feeling.
When a particle moves in a

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:47.004
circle, it has an acceleration
towards the center of this size,

00:51:47.004 --> 00:51:50.980
v^(2) over r.
Very simple.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:54.011
It comes from the fact that
velocity is a vector and you can

00:51:54.011 --> 00:51:56.940
change your velocity vector by
changing your direction.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.499
This particle is constantly
changing its direction,

00:51:59.499 --> 00:52:01.699
but it therefore has an
acceleration and the

00:52:01.699 --> 00:52:03.490
acceleration,
we have shown here,

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:06.099
is pointing towards the center.
The size of that is

00:52:06.099 --> 00:52:08.573
v^(2) over r.
For example,

00:52:08.573 --> 00:52:12.532
if a car is going on a
racetrack and you're seeing it

00:52:12.532 --> 00:52:15.727
from the top,
if the speedometer says 60

00:52:15.727 --> 00:52:18.542
miles per hour,
you might say it's not

00:52:18.542 --> 00:52:21.780
accelerating.
That's the layperson's view.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:25.066
If it's going in a circle,
you will say from now on,

00:52:25.066 --> 00:52:27.579
that it, indeed,
has an acceleration,

00:52:27.579 --> 00:52:30.829
even though no one's stepping
on the accelerator,

00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:33.470
of amount v^(2) over
r.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:38.937
That's a very important thing.
That's what you're learning in

00:52:38.937 --> 00:52:41.392
this course.
The fact that when you step on

00:52:41.392 --> 00:52:43.230
your gas you accelerate,
everybody knows.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:46.083
The fact that when you go in a
circle, you accelerate is what

00:52:46.083 --> 00:52:48.711
we're learning here,
coming from the fact that

00:52:48.711 --> 00:52:52.379
velocity is a vector and its
change can be due to change in

00:52:52.379 --> 00:52:54.909
the magnitude or change in
direction.

00:52:54.909 --> 00:52:57.324
This was a problem,
but the magnitude of velocity

00:52:57.324 --> 00:53:00.342
was nailed down and fixed at
ωr, but the direction is

00:53:00.342 --> 00:53:07.582
constantly changing.
So I'm going to now do a second

00:53:07.582 --> 00:53:13.672
class of problems.
We will return to this issue

00:53:13.672 --> 00:53:16.656
later.
By the way, one thing I should

00:53:16.656 --> 00:53:19.097
mention to you.
Suppose the particle is not

00:53:19.097 --> 00:53:20.610
moving in a circle,
but does this.

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:25.489
Let's take a circle and just
keep a quarter of the circle.

00:53:25.489 --> 00:53:28.391
During this part,
when you're doing a quarter of

00:53:28.391 --> 00:53:31.909
a circle, this is supposed to be
a quarter of a circle.

00:53:31.909 --> 00:53:35.730
You have the same acceleration
directed towards the center.

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.606
In other words,
you don't have to be moving

00:53:37.606 --> 00:53:39.750
actually in a circle to have the
acceleration.

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:41.778
At any instant,
your motion,

00:53:41.778 --> 00:53:45.835
if it follows any curve,
locally can be approximated as

00:53:45.835 --> 00:53:49.224
being part of some circle.
You can take circles of

00:53:49.224 --> 00:53:52.182
different size and place them
against your trajectory and see

00:53:52.182 --> 00:53:54.289
which one fits.
That's the r.

00:53:54.289 --> 00:53:56.786
v^(2) over r is
the acceleration directed

00:53:56.786 --> 00:53:58.450
towards the center of that
circle.

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:07.262
One miscellaneous result,
which we don't use very much

00:54:07.262 --> 00:54:10.460
now, but which I should mention
to you is the following.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:13.739
Suppose this is the ground with
some origin here.

00:54:13.739 --> 00:54:16.969
That's the plane with some
origin here.

00:54:16.969 --> 00:54:19.449
And in the plane there is some
other object.

00:54:19.449 --> 00:54:23.000
What's the location of the
object?

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:28.333
Let us say P for plane,
G for ground,

00:54:28.333 --> 00:54:32.159
O for object.
I think it's clear,

00:54:32.159 --> 00:54:36.286
the position of the object with
respect to the ground,

00:54:36.286 --> 00:54:40.725
this vector is the same as the
position of the object with

00:54:40.725 --> 00:54:45.118
respect to the plane,
plus the position of the plane

00:54:45.118 --> 00:54:49.150
with respect to the ground.
Agreed?

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:53.090
Okay.
This is the picture here.

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:56.360
We can start taking derivatives
of this with respect to time.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.580
That'll say the velocity of the
object with respect to the

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.574
ground, the velocity of the
object with respect to the

00:55:02.574 --> 00:55:06.796
plane,
the velocity of the plane with

00:55:06.796 --> 00:55:10.897
respect to the ground.
That means, if you are going in

00:55:10.897 --> 00:55:12.780
a plane and you throw something
up in the air,

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:14.579
it seems to be going up and
down to you.

00:55:14.579 --> 00:55:18.026
But if I see you through the
glass, the object is going on

00:55:18.026 --> 00:55:20.807
some trajectory,
which has got both up and down

00:55:20.807 --> 00:55:24.477
and horizontal motion.
This is the rule for adding

00:55:24.477 --> 00:55:27.235
velocities.
When you have a velocity in the

00:55:27.235 --> 00:55:30.651
moving plane frame and you want
to find the velocity on the

00:55:30.651 --> 00:55:33.120
ground,
you should add to every object

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.693
in the plane the velocity of the
plane with respect to the

00:55:36.693 --> 00:55:39.190
ground.
That's intuitively clear.

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:42.460
You use it all the time,
but maybe along one dimension.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:45.800
But this is the way to do it in
two dimensions.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:49.275
There may be some simple
problem involving this in the

00:55:49.275 --> 00:55:52.619
problem I assigned,
so I am just going over this.

00:55:52.619 --> 00:55:55.929
The problem we want to do
today, a whole family of

00:55:55.929 --> 00:56:00.070
problems, looks like this.
I want to consider a particle

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:04.416
which has definite acceleration
a, a constant one,

00:56:04.416 --> 00:56:09.375
but a is now a vector.
The question I have is,

00:56:09.375 --> 00:56:14.110
"What is its location at all
future times?"

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:19.223
I think you can tell by analogy
with what I did in one dimension

00:56:19.223 --> 00:56:24.417
that the position of that object
at any time t is going to

00:56:24.417 --> 00:56:29.206
be the initial position plus
velocity times t plus ½

00:56:29.206 --> 00:56:32.324
at^(2).
Everything is the same as in

00:56:32.324 --> 00:56:34.300
1D, except everybody's a vector
now.

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:36.230
Initial position is a pair of
numbers.

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:38.190
Initial velocity is a pair of
numbers.

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:41.010
Once you know those,
you can find the position of

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:49.469
the object at all future times.
Let's take one simple example.

00:56:49.469 --> 00:56:57.010
There is somebody in a car and
decided to fly off.

00:56:57.010 --> 00:57:00.011
We want to know,
as you can tell--our concern is

00:57:00.011 --> 00:57:02.309
where does the car hit the
ground?

00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:03.960
When does the car hit the
ground?

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.190
That's the problem in two
dimensions.

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:10.726
How do we solve this problem?
We pick our origin to be this

00:57:10.726 --> 00:57:13.369
point here.
Let the height of the building

00:57:13.369 --> 00:57:15.645
be h.
Car is traveling with some

00:57:15.645 --> 00:57:17.960
initial speed
v_0 in the

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:21.851
horizontal direction.
This equation is a pair of

00:57:21.851 --> 00:57:24.340
equations.
One along x and one

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:27.040
along y.
For the x part,

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:31.261
I'm going to write x =
x_0 +

00:57:31.261 --> 00:57:35.118
v_0t.
x_0 I'm going

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:38.099
to reduce to 0 by choice of my
origin being here.

00:57:38.099 --> 00:57:40.225
The x coordinate of the
car is the 0,

00:57:40.225 --> 00:57:41.610
because this is my origin.

00:57:45.789 --> 00:57:47.989
How about the y
coordinate?

00:57:47.989 --> 00:57:50.668
The equation for the y
coordinate is the height of the

00:57:50.668 --> 00:57:53.715
building.
The velocity has no vertical

00:57:53.715 --> 00:57:57.000
component.
There is no vy.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.530
But it has an acceleration of
-g.

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:04.499
So this is the fate of this
person at any given time

00:58:04.499 --> 00:58:06.157
t.
Our t = 0,

00:58:06.157 --> 00:58:08.550
you have him right on top of
this edge.

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:12.330
At all future times,
x proceeds as if nothing

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:15.739
happened and then y,
you are falling.

00:58:15.739 --> 00:58:18.717
If you want to know something
like when do you hit the ground,

00:58:18.717 --> 00:58:21.059
I think it's fairly clear what
you have to do.

00:58:21.059 --> 00:58:25.295
For example,
if t* is the time you

00:58:25.295 --> 00:58:29.848
hit the ground,
then t* satisfies the

00:58:29.848 --> 00:58:34.719
equation h - ½
gt*^(2) = 0.

00:58:34.719 --> 00:58:38.168
You solve for the t*
from this one and you put it

00:58:38.168 --> 00:58:41.550
there.
That tells you where you land.

00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:44.889
I don't think I have to
actually do that step.

00:58:44.889 --> 00:58:47.179
I'm assuming you can fill in
the blanks.

00:58:47.179 --> 00:58:50.659
Solve this equation for
t*, put it there and

00:58:50.659 --> 00:58:54.520
that's where you land.
That's one class of problems.

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.520
Here's the second class.

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:06.863
The second class is the most
popular application of what I'm

00:59:06.863 --> 00:59:09.749
doing now.
I want you not to memorize

00:59:09.749 --> 00:59:13.789
every formula the book gives you
for this problem.

00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:15.820
That's a problem of projectile
motion.

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:22.019
Projectile motion.
You start here and you fire a

00:59:22.019 --> 00:59:25.379
projectile with some velocity
v_0 at some

00:59:25.379 --> 00:59:29.684
angle θ.
It's going to go up and it's

00:59:29.684 --> 00:59:33.225
going to come down.
One question is:

00:59:33.225 --> 00:59:36.781
Where is it going to land?
Another question is:

00:59:36.781 --> 00:59:40.902
At what angle should you fire
your projectile so it will go

00:59:40.902 --> 00:59:43.238
the furthest?
You can find the equation,

00:59:43.238 --> 00:59:45.634
but you've got to think a
little bit before you solve

00:59:45.634 --> 00:59:47.758
everything.
It's good to have an idea of

00:59:47.758 --> 00:59:50.811
what's coming.
Imagine you got this monster

00:59:50.811 --> 00:59:53.994
cannon to fire things.
It's got a fixed speed

00:59:53.994 --> 00:59:56.511
v_0.
How do you want to aim it so

00:59:56.511 --> 00:59:59.480
you can be most effective?
Go as far as you can?

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.179
There are two schools of
thought.

01:00:02.179 --> 01:00:06.309
One says, aim at your enemy and
fire like this.

01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:09.333
Then it lands on your foot,
because assuming the cannon is

01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:11.720
at zero height,
the cannonball certainly comes

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.190
out towards the enemy,
but has no time of flight.

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:18.021
Other one says,
maximize the time of flight and

01:00:18.021 --> 01:00:21.406
you point a cannon like this.
It goes up, stays in the air

01:00:21.406 --> 01:00:23.989
for a very long time,
but it falls on your head.

01:00:23.989 --> 01:00:28.599
We know the truth is somewhere
between 0 and 90.

01:00:28.599 --> 01:00:31.711
Now, the naive guess may be 45,
but it turns out the naive

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:34.985
guess is actually correct.
I just want to show you how

01:00:34.985 --> 01:00:37.324
that comes out.
I don't want you to cram this

01:00:37.324 --> 01:00:39.095
formula.
This is the kind of thing you

01:00:39.095 --> 01:00:42.102
should be able to deduce.
Let's go back to the same thing

01:00:42.102 --> 01:00:46.579
I wrote earlier.
x = 0 plus-- What's the

01:00:46.579 --> 01:00:49.970
horizontal velocity?
Horizontal velocity is

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:51.510
v_0 cos
θ.

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:55.315
So x is
v_0 cos

01:00:55.315 --> 01:00:59.450
θ times t.
And y is

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:04.602
v_0 sin
θ times t minus

01:01:04.602 --> 01:01:06.510
½ gt^(2).

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.769
Now we know everything about
this particle.

01:01:13.769 --> 01:01:15.420
I told you once you know the
free parameters,

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.107
r_0 and
v_0,

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:19.170
you know everything about the
future of the object.

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:23.990
Let's ask, what's the range?
Range is that distance.

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:29.959
What's the strategy for range?
You see how long you are in the

01:01:29.959 --> 01:01:33.612
air and the whole time you are
in the air, you are traveling

01:01:33.612 --> 01:01:37.094
horizontally at this speed.
Again, let t* be the

01:01:37.094 --> 01:01:40.654
time when you hit the ground.
You said 0 =

01:01:40.654 --> 01:01:48.989
(v_0 sin
θ - ½ gt*) times

01:01:48.989 --> 01:01:53.349
t*.
I just pulled out a common key.

01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:56.580
It says you are on the ground
on two occasions.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:00.010
One is initially.
We are not interested in that.

01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:02.370
If the time you are interested
in is not zero,

01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:05.360
you're allowed to cancel it and
get the time from here.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.874
That time is t* =
2v_0 sin

01:02:10.874 --> 01:02:15.574
θ over g.
That's how long you are in the

01:02:15.574 --> 01:02:17.368
air.
This says, if you want to be in

01:02:17.368 --> 01:02:19.639
the air for a long time,
maximize sin θ,

01:02:19.639 --> 01:02:22.250
so you may think that 90
degrees is the best angle.

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:25.274
But that's not the goal.
The goal is to get the biggest

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:28.244
range.
Go back to x and put

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:33.632
your value for t*,
which is 2v_0

01:02:33.632 --> 01:02:37.501
sin θ/g.
That becomes

01:02:37.501 --> 01:02:44.550
v_0^(2)/g times
2 sin θ cos θ.

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:47.760
If you go back to your
trigonometry,

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.630
you should find that is really
the formula for sin 2θ.

01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:56.895
That's another example where
knowing the trigonometry is very

01:02:56.895 --> 01:02:57.440
helpful.

01:03:04.039 --> 01:03:06.500
This tells you exactly what you
want.

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.360
It says, make sin 2θ as
big as you want.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:14.631
That tells you 2θ is
going to be 90 and θ is

01:03:14.631 --> 01:03:18.524
going to be 45.
It's not from a naive guess

01:03:18.524 --> 01:03:21.690
that it's halfway between 0 and
90.

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:25.892
It turns out to be-- there's a
fairly complicated balance

01:03:25.892 --> 01:03:29.120
between the time of flight and
the range.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.420
Some people memorize this.
I would say, don't do that.

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:35.537
After a while,
you won't have room in your

01:03:35.537 --> 01:03:38.696
head for anything.
Just go back as often as

01:03:38.696 --> 01:03:43.570
possible to this formula and
work your way from there.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:47.710
There are more variations,
but it's always the same thing.

01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:51.489
Here's another variation.
In my days, they would say,

01:03:51.489 --> 01:03:56.171
"Find out when you want an
object to go through that

01:03:56.171 --> 01:03:59.336
point."
I tell you the initial velocity

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:03.105
v_0,
I tell you at what angle I fire

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:05.784
it.
I want you to find the speed so

01:04:05.784 --> 01:04:10.269
it will land here.
How do you do that problem?

01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:13.582
You do that problem by saying,
suppose this actually happens

01:04:13.582 --> 01:04:16.292
at some time t.
At that time t,

01:04:16.292 --> 01:04:19.449
the x coordinate must
have a certain value.

01:04:19.449 --> 01:04:22.527
Then go to the x
equation and demand that this be

01:04:22.527 --> 01:04:25.659
equal to the desired x
value and find the time.

01:04:25.659 --> 01:04:29.159
I take the time and put it in
the y equation and demand

01:04:29.159 --> 01:04:32.199
that the y I get,
agrees with this y.

01:04:32.199 --> 01:04:35.030
If you do that,
you will find there is one

01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:37.654
unknown, which is
v_0,

01:04:37.654 --> 01:04:40.829
and we can solve for
v_0.

01:04:40.829 --> 01:04:44.239
This is the most general
problem you can have.

01:04:44.239 --> 01:04:46.797
In the textbook,
of course, people make them

01:04:46.797 --> 01:04:49.570
interesting.
Suddenly there's a mountain.

01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:53.920
There's a physicist hiking on
this mountain.

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.756
See, you're already laughing.
It's not a very credible

01:04:57.756 --> 01:05:00.085
problem.
We don't hike and when we get

01:05:00.085 --> 01:05:03.269
stuck, we don't want food,
we want our table of integrals.

01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:05.989
That's what we want somebody to
send to us.

01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:10.214
These problems are embellished
in many ways to make you all

01:05:10.214 --> 01:05:12.175
feel involved.
For example,

01:05:12.175 --> 01:05:15.686
instead of a stone dropping,
nowadays there's a monkey

01:05:15.686 --> 01:05:19.323
that's falling down.
The people in life sciences

01:05:19.323 --> 01:05:23.159
feel, "Hey, we are represented
in this subject."

01:05:23.159 --> 01:05:25.865
All those creatures,
which are very interesting,

01:05:25.865 --> 01:05:28.743
in the end, you are told,
"There's a horse inside a

01:05:28.743 --> 01:05:31.405
railway carriage."
You cannot see the horse,

01:05:31.405 --> 01:05:34.180
but the horse is moving.
You can deduce it because the

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.800
carriage is moving the other
way.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.914
There's a picture of a horse,
a picture of the carriage,

01:05:38.914 --> 01:05:40.789
all glossy stuff.
Then it says,

01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:43.190
"Treat the horse as a point
particle."

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:46.366
See?
That's what we learned in the

01:05:46.366 --> 01:05:47.563
old days.
But nowadays,

01:05:47.563 --> 01:05:49.014
it's a horse,
but in the end,

01:05:49.014 --> 01:05:51.449
if you're going to treat it as
a point particle,

01:05:51.449 --> 01:05:53.470
it seems to me to be a real
waste.

01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:57.285
If you're the Godfather, right?
You want to get the contract

01:05:57.285 --> 01:05:59.785
for Johnny Fontaine,
you don't tell your

01:05:59.785 --> 01:06:03.118
consiglieri, "Hey Tom,
put a point particle on Jack's

01:06:03.118 --> 01:06:05.708
bed."
When you want a horse,

01:06:05.708 --> 01:06:08.780
use a horse.
When you want a point particle,

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:12.002
if you wake up and find a point
particle on your bed,

01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:16.176
what's your reaction?
I think these extra pictures

01:06:16.176 --> 01:06:21.357
sometimes they're helpful,
sometimes they just make the

01:06:21.357 --> 01:06:25.251
book cost a lot more.
There are problem in that a

01:06:25.251 --> 01:06:28.199
horse must be treated when we
study rigid bodies.

01:06:28.199 --> 01:06:30.949
Even there, a horse is not
really a rigid body,

01:06:30.949 --> 01:06:33.340
unless it's been dead for a
long time.

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.210
The fact is not a point
particle is important.

01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:39.447
I think the reason books are
bigger and bigger but still

01:06:39.447 --> 01:06:42.978
carry the same information is
that examples are more and more

01:06:42.978 --> 01:06:45.390
interesting.
Sometimes they serve a purpose.

01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:49.231
Sometimes they are distracting.
I haven't written a book in

01:06:49.231 --> 01:06:52.000
this field, so I will not say
anything more.

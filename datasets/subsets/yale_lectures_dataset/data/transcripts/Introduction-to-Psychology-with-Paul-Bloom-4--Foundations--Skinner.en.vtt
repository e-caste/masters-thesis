00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.219
Professor Paul Bloom:
I actually want to begin by

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.790
going back to Freud and hitting
a couple of loose ends.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.651
There was a point in my lecture
on Wednesday where I skipped

00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:24.494
over some parts.
I said, "We don't have time for

00:00:24.494 --> 00:00:26.320
this" and I just whipped past
it.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.030
And I couldn't sleep over the
weekend.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.844
I've been tormented.
I shouldn't have skipped that

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:35.180
and I want to hit--Let me tell
you why I skipped it.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.093
The discussion I skipped was
the discussion of why we would

00:00:39.093 --> 00:00:42.866
have an unconscious at all.
So, I was talking about the

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:46.834
scientifically respectable ideas
of Freud and I want to talk

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:51.140
about some new ideas about why
there could be an unconscious.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.477
Now, the reason why I skipped
it is I'm not sure this is the

00:00:55.477 --> 00:00:58.050
best way to look at the
question.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.778
As we will learn throughout the
course, by far the vast majority

00:01:02.778 --> 00:01:06.415
of what our brains do,
the vast majority of what our

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:09.579
minds do, is unconscious and
we're unaware of it.

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.932
So the right question to ask
may not be, "Why are some things

00:01:13.932 --> 00:01:17.082
unconscious?"
but rather, why is this tiny

00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:20.470
subset of mental life--why is
this conscious?

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.682
On the other hand,
these claims about the utility

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:26.829
of unconsciousness,
I think, are provocative and

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.503
interesting.
So I just wanted to quickly

00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:32.052
share them with you.
So, the question is,

00:01:32.052 --> 00:01:34.982
from an evolutionary
standpoint, "Why would an

00:01:34.982 --> 00:01:38.645
unconscious evolve?"
And an answer that some

00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:43.730
psychologists and biologists
have given is deception.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.090
So, most animals do some
deception.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.314
And deception defined broadly
is simply to act or be in some

00:01:50.314 --> 00:01:53.894
way that fools others into
believing or thinking or

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:56.830
responding to something that's
false.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.680
There's physical examples of
deception.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.425
When threatened,
chimpanzees--their hair stands

00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:06.886
up on end and that makes them
look bigger to fool others to

00:02:06.886 --> 00:02:09.870
thinking they're more dangerous
than they are.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.217
There's an angler fish at the
bottom of the ocean that has a

00:02:13.217 --> 00:02:16.735
rod sticking up from the top of
its head with a lure to capture

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:20.196
other fish – to fool them in
thinking that this is something

00:02:20.196 --> 00:02:22.919
edible and then to themselves be
devoured.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.990
But humans, primates in general
but particularly humans,

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.114
are masters of deception.
We use our minds and our

00:02:32.114 --> 00:02:35.657
behaviors and our actions
continually to try to trick

00:02:35.657 --> 00:02:38.449
people into believing what's not
true.

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.858
We try to trick people,
for instance,

00:02:40.858 --> 00:02:43.870
into believing that we're
tougher, smarter,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.126
sexier, more reliable,
more trustworthy and so on,

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:51.368
than we really are.
And a large part of social

00:02:51.368 --> 00:02:54.588
psychology concerns the way in
which we present ourselves to

00:02:54.588 --> 00:02:57.808
other people so as to make the
maximally positive impression

00:02:57.808 --> 00:03:00.099
even when that impression isn't
true.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.331
At the same time,
though, we've also evolved very

00:03:05.331 --> 00:03:09.875
good lie detection mechanisms.
So not only is there

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:13.094
evolutionary pressure for me to
lie to you, for me to persuade

00:03:13.094 --> 00:03:15.600
you for instance,
that if we're going to have

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.180
a--if you are threatening me
don't threaten me,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.830
I am not the sort of man you
could screw around with.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.363
But there's evolutionary
pressure for you to look and

00:03:24.363 --> 00:03:25.938
say, "No.
You are the sort of man you

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:27.939
could screw around with.
I can tell."

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.530
So how do you become a good
liar?

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.729
And here's where the
unconscious comes in.

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.794
The hypothesis is:
the best lies are lies we tell

00:03:38.794 --> 00:03:41.827
ourselves.
You're a better liar,

00:03:41.827 --> 00:03:45.861
more generally,
if you believe the lie that

00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:50.043
you're telling.
This could be illustrated with

00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:54.478
a story about Alfred Hitchcock.
The story goes--He hated

00:03:54.478 --> 00:03:58.039
working with child actors but he
often had to.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:02.293
And the story goes--He was
dealing with a child actor who

00:04:02.293 --> 00:04:05.507
simply could not cry.
And, finally frustrated,

00:04:05.507 --> 00:04:07.953
Hitchcock went to the actor,
leaned over,

00:04:07.953 --> 00:04:11.133
whispered in his ear,
"Your parents have left you and

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:14.969
they're never coming back."
The kid burst into tears.

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.435
Hitchcock said,
"Roll ‘em" and filmed the

00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:20.101
kid.
And the kid,

00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:24.691
if you were to see him,
you'd say, "That's--Boy,

00:04:24.691 --> 00:04:30.160
he's--he really looks as if
he's sad" because he was.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.891
If I had a competition where
I'd give $100,000 to the person

00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:38.420
who looks the most as if they
are in pain,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.051
it is a very good tactic to
take a pen and jam it into your

00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:47.762
groin because you will look
extremely persuasively as if you

00:04:47.762 --> 00:04:51.182
are in pain.
If I want to persuade you that

00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:55.111
I love you, would never leave
you, you can trust me with

00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:59.540
everything, it may be a superb
tactic for me to believe it.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.205
And so, this account of the
evolution of the unconscious is

00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:08.819
that certain motivations and
goals,

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.639
particularly sinister ones,
are better made to be

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.652
unconscious because if a person
doesn't know they have them they

00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:22.325
will not give them away.
And this is something I think

00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:26.796
we should return to later on
when we talk about social

00:05:26.796 --> 00:05:30.170
interaction and social
relationships.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.139
One other thing on Freud--just
a story of the falsification of

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.076
Freud.
I was taking my younger child

00:05:37.076 --> 00:05:42.326
home from a play date on Sunday
and he asked me out of the blue,

00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:46.660
"Why can't you marry your
mother or your father?"

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.267
Now, that's actually a
difficult question to ask--to

00:05:49.267 --> 00:05:51.824
answer for a child,
but I tried my best to give him

00:05:51.824 --> 00:05:55.166
an answer.
And then I said--then I thought

00:05:55.166 --> 00:06:00.589
back on the Freud lecture and so
I asked him, "If you could marry

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:03.810
anybody you want,
who would it be?"

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.383
imagining he'd make explicit
the Oedipal complex and name his

00:06:07.383 --> 00:06:13.948
mother.
Instead, he paused for a moment

00:06:13.948 --> 00:06:23.476
and said, "I would marry a
donkey and a big bag of

00:06:23.476 --> 00:06:26.351
peanuts."
[laughter]

00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:29.167
Both his parents are
psychologists and he hates these

00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:32.200
questions and at times he just
screws around with us.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:40.821
[laughter] Okay.
Last class I started with Freud

00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:44.029
and now I want to turn to
Skinner.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:47.189
And the story of Skinner and
science is somewhat different

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:51.499
from the story of Freud.
Freud developed and championed

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:55.420
the theory of psychoanalysis by
himself.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.109
It is as close as you could
find in science to a solitary

00:06:59.109 --> 00:07:01.757
invention.
Obviously, he drew upon all

00:07:01.757 --> 00:07:05.265
sorts of sources and
predecessors but psychoanalysis

00:07:05.265 --> 00:07:07.810
is identified as Freud's
creation.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.875
Behaviorism is different.
Behaviorism is a school of

00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:15.358
thought that was there long
before Skinner,

00:07:15.358 --> 00:07:19.007
championed by psychologists
like John Watson,

00:07:19.007 --> 00:07:22.332
for instance.
Skinner came a bit late into

00:07:22.332 --> 00:07:26.323
this but the reason why we've
heard of Skinner and why Skinner

00:07:26.323 --> 00:07:29.530
is so well known is he packaged
these notions.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.000
He expanded upon them;
he publicized them;

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.031
he developed them
scientifically and presented

00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:38.737
them both to the scientific
community and to the popular

00:07:38.737 --> 00:07:42.509
community and sociologically in
the 1960s and 1970s.

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:45.208
In the United States,
behaviorism was incredibly well

00:07:45.208 --> 00:07:48.516
known and so was Skinner.
He was the sort of person you

00:07:48.516 --> 00:07:52.069
would see on talk shows.
His books were bestsellers.

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:59.774
Now, at the core of behaviorism
are three extremely radical and

00:07:59.774 --> 00:08:04.966
interesting views.
The first is a strong emphasis

00:08:04.966 --> 00:08:08.671
on learning.
The strong view of behaviorism

00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:12.214
is everything you know,
everything you are,

00:08:12.214 --> 00:08:17.360
is the result of experience.
There's no real human nature.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.089
Rather, people are infinitely
malleable.

00:08:21.089 --> 00:08:25.348
There's a wonderful quote from
John Watson and in this quote

00:08:25.348 --> 00:08:29.680
John Watson is paraphrasing a
famous boast by the Jesuits.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.529
The Jesuits used to claim,
"Give me a child until the age

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:37.820
of seven and I'll show you the
man,"

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.576
that they would take a child
and turn him into anything they

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:44.163
wanted.
And Watson expanded on this

00:08:44.163 --> 00:08:46.046
boast,
Give me a dozen healthy

00:08:46.046 --> 00:08:48.841
infants, well-formed and my own
specified world to bring them up

00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:51.547
and I'll guarantee to take any
one at random and train them to

00:08:51.547 --> 00:08:54.120
become any type of specialist I
might select--doctor,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.254
lawyer, artist,
merchant, chief,

00:08:56.254 --> 00:08:59.833
and yes, even beggar-man and
thief, regardless of his

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:02.037
talents,
penchants, tendencies,

00:09:02.037 --> 00:09:05.419
abilities, vocations and race
of his ancestors.

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:09.897
Now, you could imagine--You
could see in this a tremendous

00:09:09.897 --> 00:09:13.826
appeal to this view because
Watson has an extremely

00:09:13.826 --> 00:09:18.099
egalitarian view in a sense.
If there's no human nature,

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:22.009
then there's no sense in which
one group of humans by dint of

00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:26.050
their race or their sex could be
better than another group.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.412
And Watson was explicit.
None of those facts about

00:09:29.412 --> 00:09:32.320
people will ever make any
difference.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.077
What matters to what you are is
what you learn and how you're

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:40.205
treated.
And so, Watson claimed he could

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:44.801
create anybody in any way simply
by treating them in a certain

00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:45.630
fashion.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:55.419
A second aspect of behaviorism
was anti-mentalism.

00:09:55.419 --> 00:09:59.151
And what I mean by this is the
behaviorists were obsessed with

00:09:59.151 --> 00:10:01.720
the idea of doing science and
they felt,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.681
largely in reaction to Freud,
that claims about internal

00:10:05.681 --> 00:10:08.798
mental states like desires,
wishes, goals,

00:10:08.798 --> 00:10:11.590
emotions and so on,
are unscientific.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.294
These invisible,
vague things can never form the

00:10:15.294 --> 00:10:19.344
basis of a serious science.
And so, the behaviorist

00:10:19.344 --> 00:10:23.258
manifesto would then be to
develop a science without

00:10:23.258 --> 00:10:27.555
anything that's unobservable and
instead use notions like

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:31.929
stimulus and response and
reinforcement and punishment and

00:10:31.929 --> 00:10:36.840
environment that refer to real
world and tangible events.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.279
Finally, behaviorists believed
there were no interesting

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:45.780
differences across species.
A behaviorist might admit that

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.814
a human can do things that a rat
or pigeon couldn't but a

00:10:49.814 --> 00:10:52.480
behaviorist might just say,
"Look.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.653
Those are just general
associative powers that differ"

00:10:55.653 --> 00:10:58.033
or they may even deny it.
They might say,

00:10:58.033 --> 00:11:00.169
"Humans and rats aren't
different at all.

00:11:00.169 --> 00:11:03.949
It's just humans tend to live
in a richer environment than

00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:05.798
rats."
From that standpoint,

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:08.309
from that theoretical
standpoint, comes a

00:11:08.309 --> 00:11:10.570
methodological approach which
is,

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:15.040
if they're all the same then
you could study human learning

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.221
by studying nonhuman animals.
And that's a lot of what they

00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:20.409
did.
Okay.

00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:24.380
I'm going to frame my
introduction--my discussion of

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.051
behaviors in terms of the three
main learning principles that

00:11:29.051 --> 00:11:33.100
they argue can explain all of
human mental life,

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.369
all of human behavior.
And then, I want to turn to

00:11:36.369 --> 00:11:39.282
objections to behaviorism but
these three principles are

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.030
powerful and very interesting.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:50.092
The first is habituation.
This is the very simplest form

00:11:50.092 --> 00:11:53.499
of learning.
And what this is is technically

00:11:53.499 --> 00:11:58.332
described as a decline in the
tendency to respond to stimuli

00:11:58.332 --> 00:12:02.100
that are familiar due to
repeated exposure.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:09.809
"Hey!"
"Hey!"

00:12:09.809 --> 00:12:16.271
The sudden noise startles but
as it--as you hear it a second

00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:20.572
time it startles less.
The third time is just me being

00:12:20.572 --> 00:12:24.415
goofy.
It's just--It's--You get used

00:12:24.415 --> 00:12:26.675
to things.
And this, of course,

00:12:26.675 --> 00:12:28.330
is common enough in everyday
life.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:34.330
We get used to the ticking of a
clock or to noise of traffic but

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:40.235
it's actually a very important
form of learning because imagine

00:12:40.235 --> 00:12:43.683
life without it.
Imagine life where you never

00:12:43.683 --> 00:12:46.439
got used to anything,
where suddenly somebody steps

00:12:46.439 --> 00:12:48.919
forward and waves their hand and
you'd go,

00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:52.388
"Woah," and then they wave
their hand again and you'd go,

00:12:52.388 --> 00:12:54.371
"Whoah," and you
keep--[laughter]

00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:57.840
And there's the loud ticking of
a clock and you say,

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:03.377
"Hmmm."
And that's not the way animals

00:13:03.377 --> 00:13:06.350
or humans work.
You get used to things.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.700
And it's actually critically
important to get used to things

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.124
because it's a useful adaptive
mechanism to keep track on new

00:13:15.124 --> 00:13:17.981
events and objects.
It's important to notice

00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:20.981
something when it's new because
then you have to decide whether

00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:24.076
it's going to harm you,
how to deal with it,

00:13:24.076 --> 00:13:28.299
to attend to it,
but you can't keep on noticing

00:13:28.299 --> 00:13:29.671
it.
And, in fact,

00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:32.769
you should stop noticing it
after it's been in the

00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:36.419
environment for long enough.
So, this counts as learning

00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:38.860
because it happens through
experience.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.044
It's a way to learn through
experience, to change your way

00:13:41.044 --> 00:13:44.761
of thinking through experience.
And also, it's useful because

00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:50.003
harmful stimuli are noticed but
when something has shown itself

00:13:50.003 --> 00:13:55.159
to be part of the environment
you don't notice it anymore.

00:13:55.159 --> 00:13:59.500
The existence of habituation is
important for many reasons.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.629
One thing it's important for is
clever developmental

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:07.839
psychologists have used
habituation as a way to study

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:10.965
people,
creatures who can't talk like

00:14:10.965 --> 00:14:13.740
nonhuman animals,
and young babies.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.010
And when I talk on Wednesday
about developmental psychology

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.134
I'll show different ways in
which psychologists have used

00:14:22.134 --> 00:14:25.889
habituation to study the minds
of young babies.

00:14:25.889 --> 00:14:31.649
The second sort of learning is
known as classical conditioning.

00:14:31.649 --> 00:14:36.146
And what this is in a very
general sense is the learning of

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:40.720
an association between one
stimulus and another stimulus,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.626
where stimulus is a technical
term meaning events in the

00:14:44.626 --> 00:14:48.390
environment like a certain smell
or sound or sight.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:56.433
It was thought up by Pavlov.
This is Pavlov's famous dog and

00:14:56.433 --> 00:14:59.990
it's an example of scientific
serendipity.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:04.903
Pavlov, when he started this
research, had no interest at all

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:08.389
in learning.
He was interested in saliva.

00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:11.750
And to get saliva he had to
have dogs.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.224
And he had to attach something
to dogs so that their saliva

00:15:15.224 --> 00:15:17.740
would pour out so he could study
saliva.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.240
No idea why he wanted to study
saliva, but he then discovered

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.798
something.
What he would do is he'd put

00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:27.820
food powder in the dog's mouth
to generate saliva.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:33.210
But Pavlov observed that when
somebody entered the room who

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.649
typically gave him the food
powder,

00:15:36.649 --> 00:15:39.470
the dog--the food powder saliva
would start to come out.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:44.568
And later on if you--right
before or right during you give

00:15:44.568 --> 00:15:50.293
the dog some food – you ping a
bell – the bell will cause the

00:15:50.293 --> 00:15:53.353
saliva to come forth.
And, in fact,

00:15:53.353 --> 00:15:56.710
this is the apparatus that he
used for his research.

00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:05.391
He developed the theory of
classical conditioning by making

00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:09.779
a distinction between two sorts
of conditioning,

00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:13.720
two sorts of stimulus response
relationships.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.245
One is unconditioned.
An unconditioned is when an

00:16:17.245 --> 00:16:19.857
unconditioned stimulus gives
rise to an unconditioned

00:16:19.857 --> 00:16:22.518
response.
And this is what you start off

00:16:22.518 --> 00:16:25.088
with.
So, if somebody pokes you with

00:16:25.088 --> 00:16:28.470
a stick and you say,
"Ouch," because it hurts,

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.718
the poking and the "ouch" is an
unconditioned stimulus causing

00:16:31.718 --> 00:16:35.379
an unconditioned response.
You didn't have to learn that.

00:16:35.379 --> 00:16:39.253
When Pavlov put food powder in
the dog's mouth and saliva was

00:16:39.253 --> 00:16:42.416
generated, that's an
unconditioned stimulus giving

00:16:42.416 --> 00:16:44.870
rise to an unconditioned
response.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.507
But what happens through
learning is that another

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:53.129
association develops – that
between the conditioned stimulus

00:16:53.129 --> 00:16:56.476
and the conditioned response.
So when Pavlov,

00:16:56.476 --> 00:16:58.225
for instance--Well,
when Pavlov,

00:16:58.225 --> 00:17:00.481
for instance,
started before conditioning

00:17:00.481 --> 00:17:03.190
there was simply an
unconditioned stimulus,

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.156
the food in the mouth,
and an unconditioned response,

00:17:06.156 --> 00:17:07.960
saliva.
The bell was nothing.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.070
The bell was a neutral stimulus.
But over and over again,

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:16.050
if you put the bell and the
food together,

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.420
pretty soon the bell will
generate saliva.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:24.160
And now the bell--When--You
start off with the unconditioned

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.380
stimulus, unconditioned
response.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.850
When the conditioned stimulus
and the unconditioned stimulus

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.910
are brought together over and
over and over again,

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.752
pretty soon the conditioned
stimulus gives rise to the

00:17:36.752 --> 00:17:39.377
response.
And now it's known as the

00:17:39.377 --> 00:17:43.910
conditioned stimulus giving rise
to the conditioned response.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.460
This is discussed in detail in
the textbook but I also--I'm

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.230
going to give you--Don't panic
if you don't get it quite now.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.329
I'm going to give you further
and further examples.

00:17:52.329 --> 00:17:55.860
So, the idea here is,
repeated pairings of the

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.568
unconditioned stimulus and the
conditioned stimulus will give

00:18:00.568 --> 00:18:03.950
rise to the response.
And there's a difference

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.970
between reinforced trials and
unreinforced trials.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.943
A reinforced trial is when the
conditioned stimulus and the

00:18:09.943 --> 00:18:11.839
unconditioned stimulus go
together.

00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:16.025
You're--and to put it in a
crude way, you're teaching the

00:18:16.025 --> 00:18:18.940
dog that the bell goes with the
food.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:25.566
An unreinforced trial is when
you get the food without the

00:18:25.566 --> 00:18:27.942
bell.
You're not teaching the dog

00:18:27.942 --> 00:18:29.025
this.
And, in fact,

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:32.191
once you teach an animal
something, if you stop doing the

00:18:32.191 --> 00:18:35.980
teaching the response goes away
and this is known as extinction.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:40.456
But here's a graph.
If you get--They really count

00:18:40.456 --> 00:18:43.059
the number of cubic centimeters
of saliva.

00:18:43.059 --> 00:18:47.671
The dog is trained so that when
the bell comes on--Actually,

00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:49.720
I misframed it.
I'll try again.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:54.346
When the bell comes connected
with food, there's a lot of

00:18:54.346 --> 00:18:56.733
saliva.
An unreinforced response is

00:18:56.733 --> 00:18:59.349
when the bell goes on but
there's no food.

00:18:59.349 --> 00:19:02.400
So, it's--Imagine you're the
dog.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.470
So, you get food in your mouth,
"bell, food,

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:12.958
bell, food," and now "bell."
But next you get "bell,

00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:15.960
bell, bell."
You give it up.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:21.819
You stop.
You stop responding to the bell.

00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:25.416
A weird thing which is
discussed in the textbook is if

00:19:25.416 --> 00:19:29.556
you wait a while and then you
try it again with the bell after

00:19:29.556 --> 00:19:33.079
a couple of hours,
the saliva comes back.

00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:36.539
This is known as spontaneous
recovery.

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:41.461
So, this all seems a very
technical phenomena related to

00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:46.741
animals and the like but it's
easy to see how it generalizes

00:19:46.741 --> 00:19:50.682
and how it extends.
One interesting notion is that

00:19:50.682 --> 00:19:54.530
of stimulus generalization.
And stimulus generalization is

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.944
the topic of one of your
articles in The Norton

00:19:57.944 --> 00:20:00.125
Reader,
the one by Watson,

00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:02.468
John Watson,
the famous behaviorist,

00:20:02.468 --> 00:20:06.017
who reported a bizarre
experiment with a baby known as

00:20:06.017 --> 00:20:09.000
Little Albert.
And here's the idea.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Little Albert originally liked
rats.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.453
In fact, I'm going to show you
a movie of Little Albert

00:20:14.453 --> 00:20:15.590
originally liking rats.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.140
See.
He's okay.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.597
No problem.
Now, Watson did something

00:20:24.597 --> 00:20:28.346
interesting.
As Little Albert was playing

00:20:28.346 --> 00:20:30.603
with the rat,
"Oh, I like rats,

00:20:30.603 --> 00:20:34.892
oh," Watson went behind the
baby--this is the--it's in the

00:20:34.892 --> 00:20:38.730
chapter--and banged the metal
bar right here .

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.520
The baby, "Aah," screamed,
started to sob.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:47.874
Okay.
What's the unconditioned

00:20:47.874 --> 00:20:51.250
stimulus?
Somebody.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.660
The loud noise,
the bar, the bang.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.390
What's the unconditioned
response?

00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:03.312
Crying, sadness, misery.
And as a result of this,

00:21:03.312 --> 00:21:07.640
Little Albert grew afraid of
the rat.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:13.450
So there--what would be the
conditioned stimulus?

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.788
The rat.
What would be the conditioned

00:21:15.788 --> 00:21:17.100
response?
Fear.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.379
Excellent.
Moreover, this fear extended to

00:21:21.379 --> 00:21:24.774
other things.
So, this is a very weird and

00:21:24.774 --> 00:21:28.068
unpersuasive clip.
But the idea is--the clip is to

00:21:28.068 --> 00:21:31.471
make the point that the fear
will extend to a rabbit,

00:21:31.471 --> 00:21:33.796
a white rabbit.
So, the first part,

00:21:33.796 --> 00:21:36.450
Little Albert's fine with the
white rabbit.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.056
The second part is after he's
been conditioned and he's kind

00:21:39.056 --> 00:21:40.779
of freaked out with the white
rabbit.

00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:45.655
The problem is in the second
part they're throwing the rabbit

00:21:45.655 --> 00:21:47.850
at him but now he's okay.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.780
[laughter] Is the mic on?
Oh.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:14.753
This is fine.
This is one of a long list of

00:22:14.753 --> 00:22:18.480
experiments that we can't do
anymore.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.652
So, classical conditioning is
more than a laboratory

00:22:23.652 --> 00:22:27.544
phenomena.
The findings of classical

00:22:27.544 --> 00:22:34.069
conditioning have been extended
and replicated in all sorts of

00:22:34.069 --> 00:22:40.059
animals including crabs,
fish, cockroaches and so on.

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:46.592
And it's been argued to be an
extension of--it's argued to

00:22:46.592 --> 00:22:53.240
underlie certain interesting
aspects of human responses.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.769
So, I have some examples here.
One example is fear.

00:22:56.769 --> 00:23:01.180
So, the Little Albert idea--The
Little Albert experiment,

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:05.589
provides an illustration for
how phobias could emerge.

00:23:05.589 --> 00:23:08.630
Some proportion of people in
this room have phobias.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:13.613
Imagine you're afraid of dogs.
Well, a possible story for

00:23:13.613 --> 00:23:18.160
the--for why you became afraid
of dogs is that one day a dog

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.320
came up and he was a neutral
stimulus.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.779
No problem.
And all of a sudden he bit you.

00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:28.225
Now the pain of a bite,
being bit, and then the pain

00:23:28.225 --> 00:23:31.265
and fear of that is an
unconditioned stimulus,

00:23:31.265 --> 00:23:34.235
unconditioned response.
You're just born with that,

00:23:34.235 --> 00:23:36.449
"ow."
But the presence of the dog

00:23:36.449 --> 00:23:40.949
there is a conditioned stimulus
and so you grew to be afraid of

00:23:40.949 --> 00:23:43.251
dogs.
If you believe this,

00:23:43.251 --> 00:23:48.157
this also forms the basis for
ways for a theory of how you

00:23:48.157 --> 00:23:52.374
could make phobias go away.
How do you make conditioned

00:23:52.374 --> 00:23:55.220
stimulus, conditioned response
things go away?

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.030
Well, what you do is you
extinguish them.

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:01.878
How do you extinguish them?
Well, you show the thing that

00:24:01.878 --> 00:24:06.101
would cause you to have the fear
without the unconditioned

00:24:06.101 --> 00:24:09.150
stimulus.
Here's an illustration.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.799
It's a joke.
Sorry.

00:24:11.799 --> 00:24:15.014
He's simultaneously confronting
the fear of heights,

00:24:15.014 --> 00:24:18.669
snakes, and the dark because
he's trapped in that thing and

00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:22.010
the logic is--the logic of--the
logic is not bad.

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.200
He's stuck in there.
Those are all the--his

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.806
conditioned stimulus.
But nothing bad happens so his

00:24:27.806 --> 00:24:31.177
fear goes away.
The problem with this is while

00:24:31.177 --> 00:24:35.583
he's stuck in there he has this
screaming, horrific panic attack

00:24:35.583 --> 00:24:38.450
and then it makes his fear much
worse.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.658
So, what they do now though,
and we'll talk about this much

00:24:41.658 --> 00:24:45.087
later in the course when we talk
about clinical psychology--but

00:24:45.087 --> 00:24:47.299
one cure for phobias does draw
upon,

00:24:47.299 --> 00:24:50.890
in a more intelligent way,
the behaviorist literature.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:55.578
So, the claim about a phobia is
that there's a bad association

00:24:55.578 --> 00:24:59.881
between, say dog and fear,
or between airplanes or snakes

00:24:59.881 --> 00:25:03.600
and some bad response.
So, what they do is what's

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.909
called, "systematic
desensitization," which is they

00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:10.813
expose you to what causes you
the fear but they relax you at

00:25:10.813 --> 00:25:14.916
the same time so you replace the
aversive classical conditioned

00:25:14.916 --> 00:25:17.630
fear with something more
positive.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.029
Traditionally,
they used to teach people

00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:23.289
relaxation exercises but that
proves too difficult.

00:25:23.289 --> 00:25:26.609
So nowadays they just pump you
full of some drug to get you

00:25:26.609 --> 00:25:29.871
really happy and so you're
really stoned out of your head,

00:25:29.871 --> 00:25:34.009
you're and this isn't so bad.
It's more complicated than that

00:25:34.009 --> 00:25:38.364
but the notion is you can use
these associative tools perhaps

00:25:38.364 --> 00:25:41.050
to deal with questions about
fear,

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:48.950
phobias and how they go away.
Hunger.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:53.089
We'll spend some time in this
course discussing why we eat and

00:25:53.089 --> 00:25:55.396
when we eat.
And one answer to why we eat

00:25:55.396 --> 00:25:58.450
and when we eat is that there's
cues in the environment that are

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.579
associated with eating.
And these cues generate hunger.

00:26:02.579 --> 00:26:05.787
For those of you who are trying
to quit smoking,

00:26:05.787 --> 00:26:09.268
you'll notice that there's
time--or to quit drinking

00:26:09.268 --> 00:26:13.158
there's times of the day or
certain activities that really

00:26:13.158 --> 00:26:17.390
make you want to smoke or really
make you want to drink.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:21.746
And from a behaviorist point of
view this is because of the

00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:24.599
associative history of these
things.

00:26:24.599 --> 00:26:29.211
More speculatively,
classical conditioning has been

00:26:29.211 --> 00:26:34.468
argued to be implicated in the
formation of sexual desire,

00:26:34.468 --> 00:26:38.569
including fetishes.
So a behaviorist story about

00:26:38.569 --> 00:26:41.821
fetishes, for instance,
is it's straightforward

00:26:41.821 --> 00:26:46.710
classical conditioning.
Just as your lover's caress

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:52.586
brings you to orgasm,
your eyes happen to fall upon a

00:26:52.586 --> 00:26:55.369
shoe.
Through the simple tools of

00:26:55.369 --> 00:26:59.407
classical conditioning then,
the shoe becomes a conditioned

00:26:59.407 --> 00:27:03.375
stimulus giving rise to the
conditioned response of sexual

00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:06.304
pleasure.
This almost certainly is not

00:27:06.304 --> 00:27:09.444
the right story but again,
just as in phobias,

00:27:09.444 --> 00:27:13.213
some ideas of classical
conditioning may play some role

00:27:13.213 --> 00:27:17.750
in determining what we like and
what we don't like sexually.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.884
And in fact,
one treatment for pedophiles

00:27:20.884 --> 00:27:25.820
and rapists involved controlled
fantasies during masturbation to

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.130
shift the association from
domination and violence,

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.343
for instance,
to develop more positive

00:27:33.343 --> 00:27:36.470
associations with sexual
pleasure.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.906
So the strong classical
conditioning stories about

00:27:39.906 --> 00:27:44.043
fetishes and fears sound silly
and extreme and they probably

00:27:44.043 --> 00:27:47.760
are but at the same time
classical conditioning can be

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.757
used at least to shape the focus
of our desires and of our

00:27:51.757 --> 00:27:54.686
interests.
Final thought actually is--Oh,

00:27:54.686 --> 00:27:55.759
yeah.
Okay.

00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:58.039
So, what do we think about
classical conditioning?

00:27:58.039 --> 00:28:00.039
We talked about what
habituation is for.

00:28:00.039 --> 00:28:01.710
What's classical conditioning
for?

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:04.230
Well, the traditional view is
it's not for anything.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.517
It's just association.
So, what happens is the UCS and

00:28:07.517 --> 00:28:11.488
the CS, the bell and the food,
go together because they happen

00:28:11.488 --> 00:28:14.912
at the same time.
And so classical conditioning

00:28:14.912 --> 00:28:19.156
should be the strongest when
these two are simultaneous and

00:28:19.156 --> 00:28:23.839
the response to one is the same
as the response to the other.

00:28:23.839 --> 00:28:27.420
This is actually no longer the
mainstream view.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.750
The mainstream view is now a
little bit more interesting.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.257
It's that what happens in
classical conditioning is

00:28:33.257 --> 00:28:36.460
preparation.
What happens is you become

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:41.499
sensitive to a cue that an event
is about to happen and that

00:28:41.499 --> 00:28:44.830
allows you to prepare for the
event.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:48.795
This makes certain predictions.
It predicts that the best

00:28:48.795 --> 00:28:52.279
timing is when the conditioned
stimulus, which is the signal,

00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:55.450
comes before the unconditioned
stimulus, which is what you have

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:58.257
to prepare for.
And it says the conditioned

00:28:58.257 --> 00:29:02.490
response may be different from
the unconditioned response.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:06.388
So, move away from food.
Imagine a child who's being

00:29:06.388 --> 00:29:10.331
beaten by his father.
And when his father raises his

00:29:10.331 --> 00:29:13.049
hand he flinches.
Well, that's classical

00:29:13.049 --> 00:29:16.067
conditioning.
What happened in that case is

00:29:16.067 --> 00:29:20.799
he has learned that the raising
of a hand is a signal that he is

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:24.779
about to be hit and so he
responds to that signal.

00:29:24.779 --> 00:29:29.240
His flinch is not the same
response that one would give if

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.750
one's hit.
If you're hit, you don't flinch.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.538
If you're hit,
you might feel pain or bounce

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:36.387
back or something.
Flinching is preparation for

00:29:36.387 --> 00:29:38.231
being hit.
And, in general,

00:29:38.231 --> 00:29:41.976
the idea of what goes on in
classical conditioning is that

00:29:41.976 --> 00:29:44.670
the response is sort of a
preparation.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:47.589
The conditioned response is a
preparation for the

00:29:47.589 --> 00:29:50.836
unconditioned stimulus.
Classical conditioning shows up

00:29:50.836 --> 00:29:53.225
all over the place.
As a final exercise,

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:56.604
and I had to think about
it--Has anybody here seen the

00:29:56.604 --> 00:29:59.579
movie "Clockwork Orange"?
A lot of you.

00:29:59.579 --> 00:30:03.989
It's kind of a shocking movie
and unpleasant and very violent

00:30:03.989 --> 00:30:08.325
but at its core one of the main
themes is right out of Intro

00:30:08.325 --> 00:30:10.589
Psych.
It's classical conditioning.

00:30:10.589 --> 00:30:14.523
And a main character,
who is a violent murderer and

00:30:14.523 --> 00:30:19.480
rapist, is brought in by some
psychologists for some therapy.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.359
And the therapy he gets is
classical conditioning.

00:30:22.359 --> 00:30:25.092
In particular,
what happens is he is given a

00:30:25.092 --> 00:30:28.650
drug that makes him violently
ill, extremely nauseous.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:32.214
And then his eyes are propped
open and he's shown scenes of

00:30:32.214 --> 00:30:34.955
violence.
As a result of this sort of

00:30:34.955 --> 00:30:38.322
conditioning,
he then – when he experiences

00:30:38.322 --> 00:30:42.990
real world violence – he
responds with nausea and shock;

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:50.227
basically, training him to get
away from these acts of

00:30:50.227 --> 00:30:53.900
violence.
In this example--Take a moment.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.500
Don't say it aloud.
Just take a moment.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.660
What's the unconditioned
stimulus?

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.238
Okay.
Anybody, what's the

00:31:01.238 --> 00:31:03.150
unconditioned stimulus?
Somebody just say it.

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:08.887
The drug.
What's the unconditioned

00:31:08.887 --> 00:31:10.980
response?
Nausea.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.960
What's the conditioned stimulus?
Violence.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.089
What's the conditioned response?
Perfect.

00:31:19.089 --> 00:31:24.367
The third and final type of
learning is known as operant

00:31:24.367 --> 00:31:28.589
conditioning or instrumental
conditioning.

00:31:28.589 --> 00:31:32.981
And this is the thing,
this is the theory championed

00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:36.769
and developed most extensively
by Skinner.

00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:41.486
What this is is learning the
relationships between what you

00:31:41.486 --> 00:31:45.226
do and how successful or
unsuccessful they are,

00:31:45.226 --> 00:31:48.560
learning what works and what
doesn't.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.838
It's important.
This is very different from

00:31:50.838 --> 00:31:54.071
classical conditioning and one
way to see how this is different

00:31:54.071 --> 00:31:56.940
is for classical conditioning
you don't do anything.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:01.379
You could literally be strapped
down and be immobile and these

00:32:01.379 --> 00:32:04.799
connections are what you
appreciate and you make

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:08.891
connections in your mind.
Instrumental conditioning is

00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:12.946
voluntary.
You choose to do things and by

00:32:12.946 --> 00:32:18.816
dint of your choices.
Some choices become more

00:32:18.816 --> 00:32:24.040
learned than others.
So, the idea itself was

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:29.470
developed in the nicest form by
Thorndike who explored how

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:32.755
animals learn.
Remember behaviorists were

00:32:32.755 --> 00:32:35.830
entirely comfortable studying
animals and drawing

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:38.970
extrapolations to other animals
and to humans.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.950
So, he would put a cat in a
puzzle box.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.924
And the trick to a puzzle box
is there's a simple way to get

00:32:45.924 --> 00:32:48.955
out but you have to kind of pull
on something,

00:32:48.955 --> 00:32:51.920
some special lever,
to make it pop open.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.427
And Thorndike noted that cats
do not solve this problem

00:32:56.427 --> 00:33:00.149
through insight.
They don't sit in the box for a

00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:04.230
while and mull it over and then
figure out how to do it.

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:07.501
Instead, what they do is they
bounce all around doing

00:33:07.501 --> 00:33:11.339
different things and gradually
get better and better at it.

00:33:11.339 --> 00:33:13.761
So, what they do is,
the first time they might

00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:15.914
scratch at the bars,
push at the ceiling,

00:33:15.914 --> 00:33:17.960
dig at the floor,
howl, etc., etc.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.269
And one of their behaviors is
pressing the lever.

00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:23.995
The lever gets them out of the
box, but after more and more

00:33:23.995 --> 00:33:27.656
trials they stopped scratching
at the bars, pushing at the

00:33:27.656 --> 00:33:31.420
ceiling and so on.
They just pressed the lever.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.866
And if you graph it,
they gradually get better and

00:33:34.866 --> 00:33:37.510
better.
They throw out all of these

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:41.420
behaviors randomly.
Some of them get reinforced and

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.260
those are the ones that survive
and others don't get reinforced

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.539
and those are the ones that go
extinct.

00:33:49.539 --> 00:33:53.418
And it might occur to some of
you that this seems to be an

00:33:53.418 --> 00:33:57.023
analogy with the Darwinian
theory of natural selection

00:33:57.023 --> 00:34:00.970
where there's a random
assortment of random mutations.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:04.612
And sexual selections give rise
to a host of organisms,

00:34:04.612 --> 00:34:08.659
some of which survive and are
fit and others which aren't.

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:12.144
And in fact,
Skinner explicitly made the

00:34:12.144 --> 00:34:16.701
analogy from the natural
selection of species to the

00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:21.965
natural selection of behavior.
So this could be summarized as

00:34:21.965 --> 00:34:25.526
the law of effect,
which is a tendency to perform

00:34:25.526 --> 00:34:30.199
– an action's increased if
rewarded, weakened if it's not.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:34.329
And Skinner extended this more
generally.

00:34:34.329 --> 00:34:39.643
So, to illustrate Skinnerian
theory in operant conditioning

00:34:39.643 --> 00:34:43.400
I'll give an example of training
a pig.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.699
So here is the idea.
You need to train a pig and you

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:51.969
need to do so through operant
conditioning.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:55.614
So one of the things you want
to do is--The pig is going to do

00:34:55.614 --> 00:34:58.840
some things you like and some
things you don't like.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:03.470
And so what you want to do,
basically drawing upon the law

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:08.019
of effect, is reinforce the pig
for doing good things.

00:35:08.019 --> 00:35:10.230
Suppose you want the pig to
walk forward.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:14.137
So, you reinforce the pig for
walking forward and you punish

00:35:14.137 --> 00:35:18.073
the pig for walking backward.
And if you do that over the

00:35:18.073 --> 00:35:20.793
fullness of time,
your reinforcement and

00:35:20.793 --> 00:35:24.699
punishment will give rise to a
pig who walks forward.

00:35:24.699 --> 00:35:28.448
There's two--One technical
distinction that people love to

00:35:28.448 --> 00:35:32.590
put on Intro Psych exams is that
the difference between positive

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:35.550
reinforcement and negative
reinforcement.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:40.460
Reinforcement is something that
makes the behavior increase.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.510
Negative reinforcement is very
different from punishment.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.179
Negative reinforcement is just
a type of reward.

00:35:47.179 --> 00:35:51.329
The difference is in positive
reinforcement you do something;

00:35:51.329 --> 00:35:55.369
in negative reinforcement you
take away something aversive.

00:35:55.369 --> 00:35:59.500
So, imagine the pig has a heavy
collar and to reward the pig for

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.909
walking forward you might remove
the heavy collar.

00:36:02.909 --> 00:36:07.610
So, these are the basic
techniques to train an animal.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:11.836
But it's kind of silly because
suppose you want your pig to

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:14.211
dance.
You don't just want your pig to

00:36:14.211 --> 00:36:17.500
walk forward.
You want your pig to dance.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.503
Well, you can't adopt the
policy of "I'm going to wait for

00:36:21.503 --> 00:36:25.717
this pig to dance and when it
does I'm going to reinforce it"

00:36:25.717 --> 00:36:29.369
because it's going to take you a
very long time.

00:36:29.369 --> 00:36:33.673
Similarly, if you're dealing
with immature humans and you

00:36:33.673 --> 00:36:36.440
want your child to get you a
beer,

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.806
you can't just sit,
wait for the kid to give you a

00:36:39.806 --> 00:36:42.280
beer and uncap the bottle and
say,

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.510
"Excellent.
Good.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:47.996
Hugs."
You've got to work your way to

00:36:47.996 --> 00:36:50.406
it.
And the act of working your way

00:36:50.406 --> 00:36:55.671
to it is known as shaping.
So, here is how to get a pig to

00:36:55.671 --> 00:36:58.335
dance.
You wait for the pig to do

00:36:58.335 --> 00:37:02.511
something that's halfway close
to dancing, like stumbling,

00:37:02.511 --> 00:37:05.709
and you reward it.
Then it does something else

00:37:05.709 --> 00:37:08.719
that's even closer to dancing
and you reward it.

00:37:08.719 --> 00:37:12.389
And you keep rewarding it as it
gets closer to closer.

00:37:12.389 --> 00:37:16.190
Here's how to get your child to
bring you some beer.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:19.084
You say, "Johnny,
could you go to the kitchen and

00:37:19.084 --> 00:37:21.653
get me some beer?"
And he walks to the kitchen and

00:37:21.653 --> 00:37:24.030
then he forgets why he's there
and you run out there.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.560
"You're such a good kid.
Congratulations.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.631
Hugs."
And then you get him to--and

00:37:28.631 --> 00:37:32.453
then finally you get him to also
open up the refrigerator and get

00:37:32.453 --> 00:37:34.167
the beer,
open the door,

00:37:34.167 --> 00:37:37.942
get the--and in that way you
can train creatures to do

00:37:37.942 --> 00:37:41.544
complicated things.
Skinner had many examples of

00:37:41.544 --> 00:37:43.257
this.
Skinner developed,

00:37:43.257 --> 00:37:46.239
in World War II,
a pigeon guided missile.

00:37:46.239 --> 00:37:50.449
It was never actually used but
it was a great idea.

00:37:50.449 --> 00:37:54.252
And people, in fact--The
history of the military in the

00:37:54.252 --> 00:37:57.772
United States and other
countries includes a lot of

00:37:57.772 --> 00:38:01.504
attempts to get animals like
pigeons or dolphins to do

00:38:01.504 --> 00:38:05.800
interesting and deadly things
through various training.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.771
More recreational,
Skinner was fond of teaching

00:38:08.771 --> 00:38:11.917
animals to play Ping-Pong.
And again, you don't teach an

00:38:11.917 --> 00:38:14.637
animal to play Ping-Pong by
waiting for it to play Ping-Pong

00:38:14.637 --> 00:38:19.511
and then rewarding it.
Rather, you reward

00:38:19.511 --> 00:38:24.828
approximations to it.
And basically,

00:38:24.828 --> 00:38:28.639
there are primary reinforcers.
There are some things pigs

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:31.480
naturally like,
food for instance.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.554
There are some things pigs
actually automatically don't

00:38:34.554 --> 00:38:38.159
like, like being hit or shocked.
But in the real world when

00:38:38.159 --> 00:38:41.113
dealing with humans,
but even when dealing with

00:38:41.113 --> 00:38:43.783
animals,
we don't actually always use

00:38:43.783 --> 00:38:46.940
primary reinforcers or negative
reinforcers.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:51.396
What we often use are things
like--for my dog saying,

00:38:51.396 --> 00:38:54.820
"Good dog."
Now, saying "Good dog" is not

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:58.327
something your dog has been
built, pre-wired,

00:38:58.327 --> 00:39:02.398
to find pleasurable.
But what happens is you can do

00:39:02.398 --> 00:39:05.676
a two-step process.
You can make "Good dog"

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:08.860
positive through classical
conditioning.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.929
You give the dog a treat and
say, "Good dog."

00:39:11.929 --> 00:39:16.030
Now the phrase "good dog" will
carry the rewarding quality.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:19.188
And you could use that
rewarding quality in order to

00:39:19.188 --> 00:39:21.364
train it.
And through this way

00:39:21.364 --> 00:39:25.624
behaviorists have developed
token economies where they get

00:39:25.624 --> 00:39:29.660
nonhuman animals to do
interesting things for seemingly

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.650
arbitrary rewards like poker
chips.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:38.150
And in this way you can
increase the utility and ease of

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:42.005
training.
Finally, in the examples we're

00:39:42.005 --> 00:39:47.608
giving, whenever the pig does
something you like you reinforce

00:39:47.608 --> 00:39:50.936
it.
But that's not how real life

00:39:50.936 --> 00:39:53.742
works.
Real life for both humans and

00:39:53.742 --> 00:39:58.403
animals involved cases where the
reinforcement doesn't happen all

00:39:58.403 --> 00:40:02.117
the time but actually happens
according to different

00:40:02.117 --> 00:40:04.599
schedules.
And so, there is the

00:40:04.599 --> 00:40:08.213
distinction between fixed
schedules versus ratios –

00:40:08.213 --> 00:40:11.550
variable schedules and ratio
versus interval.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:13.599
And this is something you could
print out to look at.

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:15.420
I don't need to go over it in
detail.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:20.692
The difference between ratio is
a reward every certain number of

00:40:20.692 --> 00:40:26.102
times somebody does something.
So, if every tenth time your

00:40:26.102 --> 00:40:31.860
dog brought you the newspaper
you gave it hugs and treats;

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:35.452
that's ratio.
An interval is over a period of

00:40:35.452 --> 00:40:38.177
time.
So, if your dog gives you--if

00:40:38.177 --> 00:40:42.253
your dog, I don't know,
dances for an hour straight,

00:40:42.253 --> 00:40:45.050
that would be an interval
thing.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:49.548
And fixed versus variable
speaks to whether you give a

00:40:49.548 --> 00:40:52.927
reward on a fixed schedule,
every fifth time,

00:40:52.927 --> 00:40:55.088
or variable,
sometimes on the third time,

00:40:55.088 --> 00:40:57.940
sometimes on the seventh time,
and so on.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.803
And these are--There are
examples here and there's no

00:41:00.803 --> 00:41:03.799
need to go over them.
It's easy enough to think of

00:41:03.799 --> 00:41:07.696
examples in real life.
So, for example,

00:41:07.696 --> 00:41:12.960
a slot machine is variable
ratio.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.829
It goes off after it's been hit
a certain number of times.

00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:19.289
It doesn't matter how long it
takes you for--to do it.

00:41:19.289 --> 00:41:21.659
It's the number of times you
pull it down.

00:41:21.659 --> 00:41:24.490
But it's variable because it
doesn't always go off on the

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:26.310
thousandth time.
You don't know.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:30.609
It's unpredictable.
The slot machine is a good

00:41:30.609 --> 00:41:35.777
example of a phenomena known as
the partial reinforcement

00:41:35.777 --> 00:41:38.219
effect.
And this is kind of neat.

00:41:38.219 --> 00:41:42.100
It makes sense when you hear it
but it's the sort of finding

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.849
that's been validated over and
over again with animals and

00:41:45.849 --> 00:41:49.179
nonhumans.
Here's the idea.

00:41:49.179 --> 00:41:52.808
Suppose you want to train
somebody to do something and you

00:41:52.808 --> 00:41:56.564
want the training such that
they'll keep on doing it even if

00:41:56.564 --> 00:41:58.920
you're not training them
anymore,

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.050
which is typically what you
want.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:06.695
If you want that,
the trick is don't reinforce it

00:42:06.695 --> 00:42:10.244
all the time.
Behaviors last longer if

00:42:10.244 --> 00:42:13.961
they're reinforced
intermittently and this is known

00:42:13.961 --> 00:42:17.010
as "the partial reinforcement
effect."

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.156
Thinking of this
psychologically,

00:42:19.156 --> 00:42:22.981
it's as if whenever you put
something in a slot machine it

00:42:22.981 --> 00:42:25.530
gave you money,
then all of a sudden it

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.139
stopped.
You keep on doing it a few

00:42:28.139 --> 00:42:30.130
times but then you say,
"Fine.

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:33.651
It doesn't work," but what if
it gave you money one out of

00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:37.517
every hundred times?
Now you keep on trying and

00:42:37.517 --> 00:42:43.304
because the reinforcement is
intermittent you don't expect it

00:42:43.304 --> 00:42:49.091
as much and so your behavior
will persist across often a huge

00:42:49.091 --> 00:42:52.559
amount of time.
Here's a good example.

00:42:52.559 --> 00:42:57.144
What's the very worst thing to
do when your kid cries to go

00:42:57.144 --> 00:43:01.807
into bed with you and you don't
want him to go into bed with

00:43:01.807 --> 00:43:04.411
you?
Well, one--The worst thing to

00:43:04.411 --> 00:43:08.150
do is for any--Actually,
for any form of discipline with

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:10.870
a kid is to say,
"No, absolutely not.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:15.610
No, no, no, no."
"Okay."

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:19.269
And then later on the kid's
going to say,

00:43:19.269 --> 00:43:24.941
"I want to do it again" and you
say no and the kid keeps asking

00:43:24.941 --> 00:43:28.288
because you've put it,
well, put it as in a

00:43:28.288 --> 00:43:30.515
psychological way,
not the way the behaviorists

00:43:30.515 --> 00:43:32.180
would put it.
The kid knows okay,

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.851
he's not going to get it right
away, he's going to keep on

00:43:34.851 --> 00:43:36.538
asking.
And so typically,

00:43:36.538 --> 00:43:40.840
what you're doing inadvertently
in those situations is you're

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.210
exploiting the partial
reinforcement effect.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.675
If I want my kid to do
something, I should say yes one

00:43:47.675 --> 00:43:50.623
out of every ten times.
Unfortunately,

00:43:50.623 --> 00:43:53.719
that's the evolution of
nagging.

00:43:53.719 --> 00:43:57.379
Because you nag,
you nag, you nag,

00:43:57.379 --> 00:44:01.593
the person says,
"Fine, okay," and that

00:44:01.593 --> 00:44:05.816
reinforces it.
If Skinner kept the focus on

00:44:05.816 --> 00:44:10.110
rats and pigeons and dogs,
he would not have the impact

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:14.801
that he did but he argued that
you could extend all of these

00:44:14.801 --> 00:44:18.380
notions to humans and to human
behavior.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.714
So for an example,
he argued that the prison

00:44:21.714 --> 00:44:26.134
system needs to be reformed
because instead of focusing on

00:44:26.134 --> 00:44:30.321
notions of justice and
retribution what we should do is

00:44:30.321 --> 00:44:34.896
focus instead on questions of
reinforcing good behaviors and

00:44:34.896 --> 00:44:39.250
punishing bad ones.
He argued for the notions of

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:43.690
operant conditioning to be
extended to everyday life and

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:48.049
argued that people's lives would
become fuller and more

00:44:48.049 --> 00:44:51.843
satisfying if they were
controlled in a properly

00:44:51.843 --> 00:44:55.370
behaviorist way.
Any questions about behaviorism?

00:45:01.679 --> 00:45:03.600
What are your questions about
behaviorism?

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:16.053
[laughter] Yes.
Student:

00:45:16.053 --> 00:45:20.210
[inaudible]--wouldn't there be
extinction after a while?

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.890
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:23.312
Good question.
The discussion was over using

00:45:23.312 --> 00:45:27.523
things like poker chips for
reinforcement and the point is

00:45:27.523 --> 00:45:29.903
exactly right.
Since the connection with the

00:45:29.903 --> 00:45:32.190
poker chips is established
through classical conditioning,

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:36.151
sooner or later by that logic
the poker chips would lose their

00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:40.684
power to serve as reinforcers.
You'd have to sort of start it

00:45:40.684 --> 00:45:44.453
up again, retrain again.
If you have a dog and you say

00:45:44.453 --> 00:45:47.010
"Good dog" to reward the dog,
by your logic,

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:49.265
which is right,
at some point you might as well

00:45:49.265 --> 00:45:51.099
give the dog a treat along with
the "Good dog."

00:45:51.099 --> 00:45:53.440
Otherwise, "Good dog" is not
going to cut it anymore.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:01.703
Yes.
Student:

00:46:01.703 --> 00:46:04.182
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:46:04.182 --> 00:46:06.662
As far as I know,
Skinner and Skinnerian

00:46:06.662 --> 00:46:09.713
psychologists were never
directly involved in the

00:46:09.713 --> 00:46:12.465
creation of prisons.
On the other hand,

00:46:12.465 --> 00:46:15.514
the psychological theory of
behaviorism has had a huge

00:46:15.514 --> 00:46:18.850
impact and I think a lot of
people's ways of thinking about

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:21.784
criminal justice and criminal
law has been shaped by

00:46:21.784 --> 00:46:24.606
behaviorist principles.
So for instance,

00:46:24.606 --> 00:46:28.238
institutions like mental
institutions and some prisons

00:46:28.238 --> 00:46:32.350
have installed token economies
where there's rewards for good

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.900
behavior,
often poker chips of a sort.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.980
And then you could cash them in
for other things.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.613
And, to some extent,
these have been shaped by an

00:46:40.613 --> 00:46:43.490
adherence to behaviorist
principles.

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:52.371
Okay.
So, here are the three general

00:46:52.371 --> 00:46:57.872
positions of behaviorism.
(1) That there is no innate

00:46:57.872 --> 00:47:00.320
knowledge.
All you need is learning.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.683
(2) That you could explain
human psychology without mental

00:47:04.683 --> 00:47:09.076
notions like desires and goals.
(3) And that these mechanisms

00:47:09.076 --> 00:47:12.230
apply across all domains and
across all species.

00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:19.087
I think it's fair to say that
right now just about everybody

00:47:19.087 --> 00:47:22.159
agrees all of these three claims
are mistaken.

00:47:22.159 --> 00:47:28.150
First, we know that it's not
true that everything is learned.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:31.465
There is considerable evidence
for different forms of innate

00:47:31.465 --> 00:47:35.062
knowledge and innate desires and
we'll look--and we'll talk about

00:47:35.062 --> 00:47:38.097
it in detail when we look at
case studies like language

00:47:38.097 --> 00:47:40.655
learning,
the development of sexual

00:47:40.655 --> 00:47:44.155
preference, the developing
understanding of material

00:47:44.155 --> 00:47:46.980
objects.
There's a lot of debate over

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:51.638
how much is innate and what the
character of the built-in mental

00:47:51.638 --> 00:47:55.779
systems are but there's nobody
who doubts nowadays that a

00:47:55.779 --> 00:48:00.659
considerable amount for humans
and other animals is built-in.

00:48:00.659 --> 00:48:04.869
Is it true that talking about
mental states is unscientific?

00:48:04.869 --> 00:48:09.039
Nobody believes this anymore
either.

00:48:09.039 --> 00:48:12.596
Science, particularly more
advanced sciences like physics

00:48:12.596 --> 00:48:15.389
or chemistry,
are all about unobservables.

00:48:15.389 --> 00:48:18.619
They're all about things you
can't see.

00:48:18.619 --> 00:48:23.573
And it makes sense to explain
complex and intelligent behavior

00:48:23.573 --> 00:48:28.690
in terms of internal mechanisms
and internal representations.

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:32.902
Once again, the computer
revolution has served as an

00:48:32.902 --> 00:48:36.559
illustrative case study.
If you have a computer that

00:48:36.559 --> 00:48:39.746
plays chess and you want to
explain how the computer plays

00:48:39.746 --> 00:48:42.372
chess,
it's impossible to do so

00:48:42.372 --> 00:48:47.235
without talking about the
programs and mechanisms inside

00:48:47.235 --> 00:48:50.275
the computer.
Is it true that animals need

00:48:50.275 --> 00:48:52.539
reinforcement and punishment to
learn?

00:48:52.539 --> 00:48:56.010
No, and there's several
demonstrations at the time of

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.480
Skinner suggesting that they
don't.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:04.000
This is from a classic study by
Tolman where rats were taught to

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.785
run a maze.
And what they found was the

00:49:06.785 --> 00:49:09.589
rats did fine.
They learn to run a maze faster

00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:12.941
and faster when they're
regularly rewarded but they also

00:49:12.941 --> 00:49:16.658
learn to run a maze faster and
faster if they are not rewarded

00:49:16.658 --> 00:49:19.819
at all.
So the reward helps,

00:49:19.819 --> 00:49:24.800
but the reward is in no sense
necessary.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:29.059
And here's a more sophisticated
illustration of the same point.

00:49:29.059 --> 00:49:32.685
Professor Paul Bloom:
And this is the sort of

00:49:32.685 --> 00:49:36.949
finding, an old finding from
before most of you were born,

00:49:36.949 --> 00:49:40.940
that was a huge embarrassment
for the Skinnerian theory,

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:44.639
as it suggests that rats in
fact had mental maps,

00:49:44.639 --> 00:49:48.848
an internal mechanism that they
used to understand the world –

00:49:48.848 --> 00:49:52.254
entirely contrary to the
behaviorist idea everything

00:49:52.254 --> 00:49:56.530
could be explained in terms of
reinforcement and punishment.

00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:59.854
Finally, is it true that
there's no animal-specific

00:49:59.854 --> 00:50:03.134
constraints for learning?
And again, the answer seems to

00:50:03.134 --> 00:50:05.426
be "no."
Animals, for instance,

00:50:05.426 --> 00:50:09.757
have natural responses.
So, you could train a pigeon to

00:50:09.757 --> 00:50:14.094
peck for food but that's because
pecking for food is a very

00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:17.929
natural response.
It's very difficult to train it

00:50:17.929 --> 00:50:22.120
to peck to escape a situation.
You can train it to flap its

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:26.285
wings to escape a situation but
it's very difficult to get it to

00:50:26.285 --> 00:50:29.700
flap its wings for food.
And the idea is they have sort

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.743
of natural responses that these
learning situations might

00:50:32.743 --> 00:50:35.612
exploit and might channel,
but essentially,

00:50:35.612 --> 00:50:39.973
they do have certain natural
ways of acting towards the

00:50:39.973 --> 00:50:43.454
world.
We know that not all stimuli

00:50:43.454 --> 00:50:49.056
and responses are created equal.
So, the Gray textbook has a

00:50:49.056 --> 00:50:52.809
very nice discussion of the
Garcia effect.

00:50:52.809 --> 00:50:56.260
And the Garcia effect goes like
this.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:51:00.559
Does anybody here have any food
aversions?

00:51:00.559 --> 00:51:02.440
I don't mean foods you don't
like.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:07.530
I mean foods that really make
you sick.

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:12.974
Often food aversions in humans
and other animals can be formed

00:51:12.974 --> 00:51:17.683
through a form of association.
What happens is suppose you

00:51:17.683 --> 00:51:21.665
have the flu and you get very
nauseous and then at the same

00:51:21.665 --> 00:51:25.030
point you eat some sashimi for
the first time.

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:28.765
The connection between being
nauseous and eating a new food

00:51:28.765 --> 00:51:31.611
is very potent.
And even if you know

00:51:31.611 --> 00:51:36.953
intellectually full well that
the sashimi isn't why you became

00:51:36.953 --> 00:51:42.469
nauseous, still you'll develop
an aversion to this new food.

00:51:42.469 --> 00:51:48.373
When I was younger – when I
was a teenager – I drank this

00:51:48.373 --> 00:51:51.619
Greek liqueur,
ouzo, with beer.

00:51:51.619 --> 00:51:55.610
I didn't have the flu at the
time but I became violently ill.

00:51:55.610 --> 00:52:01.000
And as a result I cannot abide
the smell of that Greek liqueur.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.274
Now, thank God it didn't
develop into an aversion to beer

00:52:05.274 --> 00:52:07.869
but-- [laughter]
Small miracles.

00:52:07.869 --> 00:52:11.692
But the smell is very
distinctive and for me--was new

00:52:11.692 --> 00:52:13.811
to me.
And so, through the Garcia

00:52:13.811 --> 00:52:16.050
effect I developed a strong
aversion.

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:19.821
What's interesting though is
the aversion is special so if

00:52:19.821 --> 00:52:23.922
you take an animal and you give
it a new food and then you give

00:52:23.922 --> 00:52:27.760
it a drug to make it nauseous it
will avoid that food.

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.102
But if you take an animal and
you give it a new food and then

00:52:32.102 --> 00:52:36.300
you shock it very painfully it
won't avoid the new food.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:39.714
And the idea is that a
connection between what

00:52:39.714 --> 00:52:43.280
something tastes and getting
sick is natural.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:47.155
We are hard wired to say, "Look.
If I'm going to eat a new food

00:52:47.155 --> 00:52:50.659
and I'm going to get nauseous,
I'm going to avoid that food."

00:52:50.659 --> 00:52:55.780
The Garcia effect is that this
is special to taste and nausea.

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.199
It doesn't extend more
generally.

00:52:58.199 --> 00:53:02.564
Finally, I talked about phobias
and I'll return to phobias later

00:53:02.564 --> 00:53:06.324
on in this course.
But the claim that people have

00:53:06.324 --> 00:53:11.073
formed their phobias through
classical conditioning is almost

00:53:11.073 --> 00:53:13.954
always wrong.
Instead, it turns out that

00:53:13.954 --> 00:53:17.929
there are certain phobias that
we're specially evolved to have.

00:53:17.929 --> 00:53:21.845
So, both humans and
chimpanzees, for instance,

00:53:21.845 --> 00:53:26.369
are particularly prone to
develop fears of snakes.

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:29.659
And when we talk about the
emotions later on in the course

00:53:29.659 --> 00:53:31.909
we'll talk about this in more
detail.

00:53:31.909 --> 00:53:35.886
But what seems likely is the
sort of phobias you're likely to

00:53:35.886 --> 00:53:39.797
have does not have much to do
with your personal history but

00:53:39.797 --> 00:53:43.840
rather it has a lot to do with
your evolutionary history.

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.440
Finally, the other reading
you're going to do for this

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:51.244
part--section of the course is
Chomsky's classic article,

00:53:51.244 --> 00:53:53.690
his "Review of Verbal
Behavior."

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:57.889
Chomsky is one of the most
prominent intellectuals alive.

00:53:57.889 --> 00:54:01.384
He's still a professor at MIT,
still publishes on language and

00:54:01.384 --> 00:54:05.080
thought, among other matters.
And the excerpt you're going to

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.929
read is from his "Review of
Verbal Behavior."

00:54:07.929 --> 00:54:11.302
And this is one of the most
influential intellectual

00:54:11.302 --> 00:54:14.938
documents ever written in
psychology because it took the

00:54:14.938 --> 00:54:17.650
entire discipline of behaviorism
and,

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:21.384
more than everything else,
more than any other event,

00:54:21.384 --> 00:54:25.622
could be said to have destroyed
it or ended it as a dominant

00:54:25.622 --> 00:54:29.113
intellectual endeavor.
And Chomsky's argument is

00:54:29.113 --> 00:54:32.816
complicated and interesting,
but the main sort of argument

00:54:32.816 --> 00:54:35.219
he had to make is--goes like
this.

00:54:35.219 --> 00:54:39.567
When it comes to humans,
the notions of reward and

00:54:39.567 --> 00:54:44.092
punishment and so on that
Skinner tried to extend to

00:54:44.092 --> 00:54:48.440
humans are so vague it's not
science anymore.

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.179
And remember the discussion we
had with regard to Freud.

00:54:51.179 --> 00:54:55.072
What Skinner--What Chomsky is
raising here is the concern of

00:54:55.072 --> 00:54:57.960
unfalsifiablity.
So, here's the sort of example

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.562
he would discuss.
Skinner, in his book Verbal

00:55:00.562 --> 00:55:02.884
Behavior,
talks about the question of why

00:55:02.884 --> 00:55:05.099
do we do things like talk to
ourselves,

00:55:05.099 --> 00:55:08.314
imitate sounds,
create art, give bad news to an

00:55:08.314 --> 00:55:11.460
enemy, fantasize about pleasant
situations?

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.730
And Skinner says that they all
involve reinforcement;

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:16.550
those are all reinforced
behaviors.

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:20.959
But Skinner doesn't literally
mean that when we talk to

00:55:20.959 --> 00:55:24.469
ourselves somebody gives us food
pellets.

00:55:24.469 --> 00:55:26.859
He doesn't literally mean even
that when we talk to ourselves

00:55:26.859 --> 00:55:28.890
somebody pats us on the head and
says, "Good man.

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:31.469
Perfect.
I'm very proud."

00:55:31.469 --> 00:55:33.481
What he means,
for instance,

00:55:33.481 --> 00:55:36.683
in this case is well,
talking to yourself is

00:55:36.683 --> 00:55:41.227
self-reinforcing or giving bad
news to an enemy is reinforcing

00:55:41.227 --> 00:55:44.429
because it makes your enemy feel
bad.

00:55:44.429 --> 00:55:48.870
Well, Chomsky says the problem
is not that that's wrong.

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:53.067
That's all true.
It's just so vague as to be

00:55:53.067 --> 00:55:55.850
useless.
Skinner isn't saying anything

00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:58.069
more.
To say giving bad news to an

00:55:58.069 --> 00:56:02.051
enemy is reinforcing because it
makes the enemy feel bad doesn't

00:56:02.051 --> 00:56:05.464
say anything different from
giving bad news to an enemy

00:56:05.464 --> 00:56:09.320
feels good because we like to
give bad news to an enemy.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.650
It's just putting it in more
scientific terms.

00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:16.286
More generally,
Chomsky suggests that the law

00:56:16.286 --> 00:56:22.610
of effect when applied to humans
is either trivially true,

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:28.228
trivially or uninterestingly
true, or scientifically robust

00:56:28.228 --> 00:56:33.594
and obviously false.
So, if you want to expand the

00:56:33.594 --> 00:56:38.612
notion of reward or
reinforcement to anything,

00:56:38.612 --> 00:56:42.773
then it's true.
So why did you come--those of

00:56:42.773 --> 00:56:46.710
you who are not freshmen--Oh,
you--Why did you come?

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:49.590
All of you, why did you come to
Yale for a second semester?

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:52.659
"Well, I repeated my action
because the first semester was

00:56:52.659 --> 00:56:54.960
rewarding."
Okay.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.936
What do you mean by that?
Well, you don't literally mean

00:56:57.936 --> 00:57:00.989
that somebody rewarded you,
gave you pellets and stuff.

00:57:00.989 --> 00:57:03.773
What you mean is you chose to
come there for the second

00:57:03.773 --> 00:57:06.161
semester.
And there's nothing wrong with

00:57:06.161 --> 00:57:09.440
saying that but we shouldn't
confuse it with science.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.052
And more generally,
the problem is you can talk

00:57:12.052 --> 00:57:15.175
about what other people do in
terms of reinforcement and

00:57:15.175 --> 00:57:17.901
punishment and operant
conditioning and classical

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:20.521
conditioning.
But in order to do so,

00:57:20.521 --> 00:57:24.374
you have to use terms like
"punishment" and "reward" and

00:57:24.374 --> 00:57:28.648
"reinforcement" in such a vague
way that in the end you're not

00:57:28.648 --> 00:57:33.752
saying anything scientific.
So, behaviorism as a dominant

00:57:33.752 --> 00:57:39.477
intellectual field has faded,
but it still leaves behind an

00:57:39.477 --> 00:57:44.906
important legacy and it still
stands as one of the major

00:57:44.906 --> 00:57:49.940
contributions of twentieth
century psychology.

00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:52.042
For one thing,
it has given us a richer

00:57:52.042 --> 00:57:54.476
understanding of certain
learning mechanisms,

00:57:54.476 --> 00:57:56.800
particularly with regard to
nonhumans.

00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.663
Mechanisms like habituation,
classical conditioning and

00:57:59.663 --> 00:58:02.600
operant conditioning are real;
they can be scientifically

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.715
studied;
and they play an important role

00:58:04.715 --> 00:58:07.759
in the lives of animals and
probably an important role in

00:58:07.759 --> 00:58:11.053
human lives as well.
They just don't explain

00:58:11.053 --> 00:58:13.998
everything.
Finally, and this is something

00:58:13.998 --> 00:58:16.880
I'm going to return to on
Wednesday actually,

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:21.783
behaviorists have provided
powerful techniques for training

00:58:21.783 --> 00:58:26.349
particularly for nonverbal
creatures so this extends to

00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:29.580
animal trainers.
But it also extends to people

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.980
who want to teach young children
and babies and also want to help

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.796
populations like the severely
autistic or the severely

00:58:35.796 --> 00:58:37.690
retarded.
Many of these behaviorist

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:39.670
techniques have proven to be
quite useful.

00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:43.584
And in that regard,
as well as in other regards,

00:58:43.584 --> 00:58:47.000
it stands as an important
contribution.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:09.180
Prof: Frost was born in
1879, I think;

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.935
Hart Crane in 1899,
representing almost another

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:19.460
generation from Frost.
 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.680
Auden was born in 1906,
Bishop in 1911.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.173
She's the latest,
the youngest on our syllabus

00:00:33.173 --> 00:00:40.620
and she's almost two generations
distant from Robert Frost.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.081
When I was a freshman at Yale
in 1976, in April,

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:50.730
Elizabeth Bishop came to read
at Yale.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.568
She's, in a sense,
a part of our world in a way

00:00:56.568 --> 00:01:04.310
that the poets that we've been
reading really aren't quite.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:10.363
She was good friends with John
Hollander, Penelope Laurans,

00:01:10.363 --> 00:01:15.060
on our faculty,
Sandy McClatchy and others.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.610
She filled the art gallery
lecture hall – 400 people.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.906
And this was at a moment,
interestingly,

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:30.049
when she was not yet at the
height of her fame.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.593
She would become by the end of
the century a figure as

00:01:36.593 --> 00:01:43.510
prominent, as often read and
widely read and esteemed,

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.676
as any of the poets we've been
reading, which is a remarkable

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:52.982
event in literary culture
because Bishop would have

00:01:52.982 --> 00:01:56.158
seemed,
to herself and to others

00:01:56.158 --> 00:02:01.543
through the course of most of
her career, as an interesting

00:02:01.543 --> 00:02:04.700
poet but not as a major figure.
 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.330
And surely, she was herself
uncomfortable with that kind of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.128
stature.
 

00:02:10.128 --> 00:02:15.887
She was, I think it's fair to
say, excruciated by public

00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:21.539
occasions, including this one
that I'm referring to.

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:22.550
Listen to her read.
 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.102
I think there are some
recordings of her on the Center

00:02:28.102 --> 00:02:31.139
for Language Study website.
 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:36.480
Bishop has a kind of
exaggeratedly ordinary voice,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.476
in a sense, a very private
voice that she was willing to

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:47.598
put on stage but always only
uncomfortably.

00:02:47.598 --> 00:02:52.702
So, in this particular reading,
I'm remembering she had read

00:02:52.702 --> 00:02:57.632
for about 20 minutes and then
looked across the stage with

00:02:57.632 --> 00:03:01.870
these 400 people in front of her
at her host,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.424
Penelope Laurans:
"Is that enough Penny?" she

00:03:05.424 --> 00:03:05.990
said.
 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.520
And of course,
people wanted a lot more and a

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.131
lot more of her,
but she was reluctant to give

00:03:13.131 --> 00:03:15.938
it and uncomfortable giving it.
 

00:03:15.938 --> 00:03:21.568
Bishop, in a sense,
belongs to poetry after modern

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:25.360
poetry, poetry after modernism.
 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.341
In September,
I'm going to give a lecture

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:32.739
course on poetry after 1950,
and we'll start with Bishop and

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.360
pay a lot more attention to her
than we have room to do in this

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.330
course.
 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.155
But Bishop belongs,
too, in any history of modern

00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:48.584
poetry and she provides,
I think, an important endpoint

00:03:48.584 --> 00:03:53.310
to the work that we've been
doing together.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.446
She provides,
in a sense, a kind of extension

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:05.450
of certain strains of modern
poetry and also at the same time

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.068
a kind of critique of them.
 

00:04:09.068 --> 00:04:19.153
Bishop went to Vassar and she
was on the literary magazine

00:04:19.153 --> 00:04:20.569
there.
 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:27.822
In 1929, I think,
she interviewed the important

00:04:27.822 --> 00:04:33.500
guest on the campus,
T.S. Eliot.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.209
I would have liked to have been
in the room.

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:41.863
She wrote--well,
I guess what I want to

00:04:41.863 --> 00:04:47.151
highlight is the fact that
Bishop was in college reading

00:04:47.151 --> 00:04:52.440
Eliot and having Eliot visit
when she was really forming

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.940
herself as a writer.
 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:02.358
She wrote a paper for one of
her courses called "Dimensions

00:05:02.358 --> 00:05:09.649
for a Novel," and this essay
involved a reading of Eliot's

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:12.211
essay,
"Tradition and the Individual

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:14.730
Talent," which you've read and
which we've talked about.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.629
Bishop liked it;
she was interested in it.

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:25.581
In her account of the way in
which she uses Eliot,

00:05:25.581 --> 00:05:34.660
she accents certain aspects of
his ideas and downplays others.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.370
Let me quote from that essay.
 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.910
She says--this is on your
handout:

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.591
A constant process of
adjustment [and that's Eliot's

00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:51.875
word, "adjustment"]
is going on about the

00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:56.721
past--every ingredient dropped
into it from the present must

00:05:56.721 --> 00:05:58.610
affect the whole.
 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.999
[You remember Eliot writing
about that in "Tradition and the

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:04.495
Individual Talent,"
where he talks about how new

00:06:04.495 --> 00:06:08.653
work reshapes everything that's
gone before.]

00:06:08.653 --> 00:06:14.324
Now what Mr. Eliot says about
the sequence of works of art in

00:06:14.324 --> 00:06:19.711
a tradition, in history [and
this is Bishop's extension of

00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:23.870
Eliot's idea]
seems to be equally true of the

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.879
sequence of events or even of
pages or paragraphs in a

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:30.959
novel….
 

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:34.699
but I know of no novel that
makes use of this constant

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.579
readjustment among the members
of any sequence.

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:42.702
So, what Bishop's doing is
applying Eliot's idea of

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:47.815
sequence in tradition to the way
in which a literary work might

00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:51.129
itself unfold;
that is, where every,

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:55.925
as it were, new moment in a
novel – here she's talking

00:06:55.925 --> 00:07:01.331
about a novel – affects a kind
of readjustment of what's gone

00:07:01.331 --> 00:07:02.639
on before.
 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:10.110
It is, as she's imagining it,
a literary form in which there

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:16.694
is a kind of continual
reorientation required by both

00:07:16.694 --> 00:07:19.480
reader and writer.
 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.471
She takes over specifically
that phrase "constant

00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:32.211
readjustment" and identifies
this as a kind of poetics,

00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:34.209
if you will.
 

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:40.399
This is really an important
idea in modern poetry generally.

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:43.891
And you could look at Eliot's
own poetry in,

00:07:43.891 --> 00:07:46.976
for example,
"Prufrock" as exemplifying

00:07:46.976 --> 00:07:50.470
something of what Bishop is
describing,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:56.149
that is, a poem that unfolds,
disclosing at every point new

00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:59.870
principles of order and
perspective.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:05.608
It's an idea that is in that
sense central to modern poetry,

00:08:05.608 --> 00:08:11.151
but Bishop takes it and she
pushes it in her own work much

00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:12.319
further.
 

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:18.610
She creates in her poetry a
radically relative point of view

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:24.473
that is adjusted to a kind of
metamorphic and decentered

00:08:24.473 --> 00:08:28.622
world,
as she sees it – a world that

00:08:28.622 --> 00:08:30.709
is living in change.
 

00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:35.971
That phrase you might remember
from the very end of "Primitive

00:08:35.971 --> 00:08:39.678
Like an Orb," Stevens's great,
late poem.

00:08:39.678 --> 00:08:43.798
Bishop is, in many ways,
a Stevensian poet,

00:08:43.798 --> 00:08:47.330
a poet of change,
constant change.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:54.610
But significantly in Bishop's
imagination, as in Auden's,

00:08:54.610 --> 00:09:00.330
there are no Stevensian giants,
no major men,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.580
no large men reading.
 

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:11.552
The poet in Bishop's poetry
describes the world rather than

00:09:11.552 --> 00:09:13.340
creates it.
 

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:22.269
The poet is not like God as the
poet is in Stevens.

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:28.164
The poet is much more like an
ordinary person,

00:09:28.164 --> 00:09:35.240
a woman on stage in a skirt,
speaking uncomfortably,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.303
if you like,
to a large audience in an

00:09:39.303 --> 00:09:41.168
ordinary voice.
 

00:09:41.168 --> 00:09:45.657
Her poetry is,
in fact, full of ordinary

00:09:45.657 --> 00:09:50.029
people, and this links her to
Frost.

00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:57.249
There are generally few,
oh, emblematic or archetypal

00:09:57.249 --> 00:10:05.024
figures such as you find in
Yeats or in Moore's poetry or

00:10:05.024 --> 00:10:10.440
often, for that matter,
in Auden's.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:18.626
There is in Bishop really no
sublime, no Yeatsian ascent out

00:10:18.626 --> 00:10:25.149
of "the foul rag and bone shop
of the heart."

00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:33.373
There's no Cranian verticality,
no Icarus-like ascent of the

00:10:33.373 --> 00:10:34.210
sky.
 

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:39.818
Instead, Bishop's poetics of
description are what I would

00:10:39.818 --> 00:10:45.529
call a kind of horizontal
poetics that moves laterally,

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:48.580
that is earthbound and is
concerned with,

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.621
in a sense – this is her
primary recurrent trope –

00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:56.663
mapping the world,
giving an account of the

00:10:56.663 --> 00:10:58.340
earth's surface.
 

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:04.010
It's a perceptual poetics that
she's concerned with,

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:10.240
something she calls "geography"
or sometimes "travel."

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:17.027
The poem that really
inaugurates Bishop's mature

00:11:17.027 --> 00:11:24.971
writing and that she placed
first in her first volume of

00:11:24.971 --> 00:11:28.658
poetry,
North and South,

00:11:28.658 --> 00:11:33.583
and that subsequently was
placed first in all collected

00:11:33.583 --> 00:11:38.418
volumes of her poems is the poem
called "The Map."

00:11:38.418 --> 00:11:42.966
It's a kind of preface to her
work and it's an inevitable

00:11:42.966 --> 00:11:45.889
place to start thinking about
her.

00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:47.679
So, let's look at it together.
 

00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:51.168
 
 

00:11:51.168 --> 00:12:01.721
A poem written in--I believe at
least begun New Year's Eve,

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:07.178
1933 as Bishop left college.
 

00:12:07.178 --> 00:12:12.269
Maybe you seniors will write
your own "Map" next year.

00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:20.740
She didn't collect it in a book
until 1946, which is her first

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.304
book publication;
like Stevens,

00:12:25.304 --> 00:12:32.710
like Frost, she's slow to
gather her first poems.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:40.580
The poem begins with a
marvelous, limpid clarity.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.100
Land lies in water;
it is shadowed green.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:52.080
Shadows, or are they shallows,
at its edges

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.600
showing the line of long
sea-weeded ledges

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.759
where weeds hang to the simple
blue from green.

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:05.620
Or does the land lean down to
lift the sea from under,

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.179
drawing it unperturbed around
itself?

00:13:10.179 --> 00:13:15.035
Along the fine tan sandy shelf
is the land tugging at the sea

00:13:15.035 --> 00:13:16.179
from under?
 

00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:20.070
 
 

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:26.658
It's a deceptively declarative,
flat voice, a voice of

00:13:26.658 --> 00:13:28.399
description.
 

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:36.519
It is interestingly impersonal
and intimate at once.

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:43.222
It's as if we were so close to
her she need not introduce

00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:44.418
herself.
 

00:13:44.418 --> 00:13:51.190
We are invited to look over her
shoulder with her at the map.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.451
She doesn't,
as I say, introduce herself or

00:13:54.451 --> 00:13:56.470
her subject really here.
 

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.519
She just starts.
 

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:04.366
The poem represents itself as
happening now,

00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:09.102
as if it were recording the
mind in action,

00:14:09.102 --> 00:14:13.500
a process, an action of
perception.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:19.995
The poem was gathered first for
publication by Marianne Moore,

00:14:19.995 --> 00:14:25.318
who was Bishop's friend and
mentor – a friendship

00:14:25.318 --> 00:14:30.076
described in Bishop's long,
beautiful, funny memoir,

00:14:30.076 --> 00:14:33.717
"Efforts of Affection," that I
asked you to read when we were

00:14:33.717 --> 00:14:36.735
reading Moore;
an essay that tells you a lot

00:14:36.735 --> 00:14:40.230
about Moore but also tells you a
lot about Bishop.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:44.648
Moore, as her mentor,
gathered this and two other

00:14:44.648 --> 00:14:50.169
poems and had it published in a
volume in which an older poet

00:14:50.169 --> 00:14:55.888
presented a younger,
as a teacher or mentor would

00:14:55.888 --> 00:14:58.519
present a protégé.
 

00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:02.399
Moore says about Bishop's poems
a number of interesting things.

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:07.710
I've sampled just these
sentences on your handout.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:11.546
Some authors do not muse
within themselves [but by

00:15:11.546 --> 00:15:15.153
contrast, Bishop does];
they [they, those other

00:15:15.153 --> 00:15:17.421
authors]
"think" --- like the

00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:22.120
vegetable-shredder which cuts
into the life of a thing.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.158
Miss Bishop is not one of these
frettingly intensive machines.

00:15:26.158 --> 00:15:31.070
Yet the rational considering
quality in her work is its

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.889
strength [the rational
considering quality]

00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:39.999
--- assisted by unwordiness,
uncontorted intentionalness

00:15:39.999 --> 00:15:44.558
[phrases that only Marianne
Moore could have produced],

00:15:44.558 --> 00:15:49.351
the flicker of impudence,
the natural unforced

00:15:49.351 --> 00:15:55.086
ending.
These are important qualities

00:15:55.086 --> 00:16:02.076
of Bishop's writing,
although to highlight them is

00:16:02.076 --> 00:16:09.010
to risk a sort of misperception;
that is, if Bishop presents

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:13.110
herself as a kind of rational,
considering intelligence in

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:19.033
these poems,
what she very rapidly uncovers

00:16:19.033 --> 00:16:28.399
is fantasy and the fantastic or
fabulous or metaphorical.

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:33.091
Just so, her poetry of
perception and description

00:16:33.091 --> 00:16:39.056
rather than giving us a kind of
poetics of objectivity that we

00:16:39.056 --> 00:16:43.259
might associate with Pound and
Imagism,

00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:48.091
very quickly turns back on the
perceiving subject to ask

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:52.835
questions about the process of
perception itself and to

00:16:52.835 --> 00:16:57.928
suddenly become a poetry very
much about subjectivity.

00:16:57.928 --> 00:17:04.737
You can see this going on
already in the lines that I've

00:17:04.737 --> 00:17:06.470
quoted here.
 

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:14.127
Bishop no sooner says one thing
than she elaborates it or

00:17:14.127 --> 00:17:16.180
questions it.
 

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:20.130
"Shadows, or are they
shallows," she says.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:25.211
She's formulated one idea,
and then she asks a question

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:30.009
about it, and then a further
question about that.

00:17:30.009 --> 00:17:38.232
This is very much an image of,
a poetics of a mind in action,

00:17:38.232 --> 00:17:40.700
a mind thinking.
 

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.410
That is the drama that Bishop
shares with us.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:51.902
In another early statement,
this in a letter to a poet,

00:17:51.902 --> 00:17:57.554
Donald Stanford,
she quotes a literary critic on

00:17:57.554 --> 00:18:02.980
Baroque – that is,
seventeenth-century – prose

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.470
which she liked.
 

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.190
And this quotation is also on
your handout.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.757
"Their [that is,
the writers of Baroque prose]

00:18:12.757 --> 00:18:16.070
purpose was to portray,
not a thought,

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.490
but a mind thinking….
 

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.162
They knew that an idea
separated from the act of

00:18:22.162 --> 00:18:26.460
experiencing it is not the idea
that was experienced.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.664
The ardor of its conception in
the mind [that's my misprint]

00:18:30.664 --> 00:18:33.660
is a necessary part of its
truth."

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:39.578
The ardor of the conception in
the mind is what Bishop wants.

00:18:39.578 --> 00:18:42.269
"Ardor" – that's an important
word.

00:18:42.269 --> 00:18:48.657
It suggests passion,
a certain amount of heat,

00:18:48.657 --> 00:18:51.640
emotion, and heart.
 

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.290
In Bishop's case,
this ardor is communicated

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:01.375
sometimes through the
deceptively cool manner of

00:19:01.375 --> 00:19:06.460
self-interrogation and in
particular through the

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.680
grammatical form of the
question.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.836
Here in this very first
paragraph of her poetry,

00:19:15.836 --> 00:19:19.019
Bishop is asking questions.
 

00:19:19.019 --> 00:19:23.728
There's a kind of level of
clarity and detail in her

00:19:23.728 --> 00:19:29.267
observations that makes what's
she's looking at interestingly

00:19:29.267 --> 00:19:31.759
unstable and uncertain.
 

00:19:31.759 --> 00:19:35.808
She turns back on it,
asks questions about it.

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:41.401
You could contrast Bishop's
questions with Yeats's great

00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:47.223
rhetorical questions,
a form that we stressed in

00:19:47.223 --> 00:19:54.730
reading "Leda and the Swan" and
other late Yeats poems.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:20:00.243
In general, thinking about
Bishop's relationship to Yeats,

00:20:00.243 --> 00:20:03.630
you could say that romance
quest,

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:09.441
which is this essential
structure that's behind all of

00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:14.375
Yeats's poetry,
romance quest has come down in

00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:18.980
Bishop to the act of asking
questions,

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.972
raising questions,
here in this poem and very

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:28.417
frequently in other Bishop poems
questions specifically about

00:20:28.417 --> 00:20:32.948
boundaries,
about the way in which we

00:20:32.948 --> 00:20:40.676
categorize and frame the world,
how we draw lines and separate

00:20:40.676 --> 00:20:45.618
and connect things at the same
time.

00:20:45.618 --> 00:20:51.140
As we do, one thing seems to
turn into another;

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:56.700
opposites interact,
opposites are involved.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:03.190
Notice the pair of opposites
that she's stressing here.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.867
Land and water:
these are primary categories

00:21:06.867 --> 00:21:11.660
that her poetry centers itself
on over and over again.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.910
Bishop is a poet of the
seashore.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:20.016
There are poems throughout her
career that station themselves

00:21:20.016 --> 00:21:23.068
on the beach,
in particular;

00:21:23.068 --> 00:21:31.680
a place of unstable,
uncertain dynamic boundary.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.997
You can see the same kind of
play of similarity and

00:21:36.997 --> 00:21:42.740
difference between terms in
Bishop's poetry on a formal

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:48.269
level already working here in
this first stanza.

00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:52.038
It is rhymed poetry, isn't it?
 

00:21:52.038 --> 00:21:55.680
But what an interesting set of
rhymes!

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:06.608
Green, edges, ledges, green;
under, itself, shelf, under.

00:22:06.608 --> 00:22:13.855
These are rhymes where it seems
as though words are a little too

00:22:13.855 --> 00:22:15.808
close together.
 

00:22:15.808 --> 00:22:20.126
They're repeated,
"green," or maybe a little too

00:22:20.126 --> 00:22:21.230
far apart.
 

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:25.397
In the second stanza then,
the rhyme scheme gives way

00:22:25.397 --> 00:22:26.278
entirely.
 

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:31.868
And this is like Bishop to set
up one pattern and then drop it.

00:22:31.868 --> 00:22:35.036
The shadow of
Newfoundland lies flat and

00:22:35.036 --> 00:22:35.598
still.
 

00:22:35.598 --> 00:22:38.589
Labrador's yellow,
where the moony Eskimo

00:22:38.589 --> 00:22:40.759
has oiled it.
 

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:46.018
We can stroke these lovely bays,
under a glass as if they were

00:22:46.018 --> 00:22:50.428
expected to blossom,
or as if to provide a clean

00:22:50.428 --> 00:22:52.650
cage for invisible fish.
 

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:57.038
The names of seashore towns run
out to sea,

00:22:57.038 --> 00:23:00.778
the names of cities cross the
neighboring mountains

00:23:00.778 --> 00:23:05.200
-- the printer here
experiencing the same excitement

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.750
as when emotion too far exceeds
its cause.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:14.690
These peninsulas take the water
between thumb and finger

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:18.349
like women feeling for the
smoothness of yard-goods.

00:23:18.349 --> 00:23:22.009
 
 

00:23:22.009 --> 00:23:27.638
Then the rhyme scheme returns,
and, again, it's a peculiar one

00:23:27.638 --> 00:23:33.176
that includes not just a rhyme
but a repetition of particular

00:23:33.176 --> 00:23:34.098
words.
 

00:23:34.098 --> 00:23:40.277
Mapped waters [she says]
are more quiet than the land

00:23:40.277 --> 00:23:45.307
is,
lending the land their waves'

00:23:45.307 --> 00:23:51.517
own conformation:
and Norway's hare runs south in

00:23:51.517 --> 00:23:56.144
agitation,
profiles investigate the sea,

00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:57.910
where land is.
 

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:03.342
Are they assigned,
or can the countries pick their

00:24:03.342 --> 00:24:04.338
colors?
 

00:24:04.338 --> 00:24:07.838
-- What suits the character or
the native waters best.

00:24:07.838 --> 00:24:12.640
Topography displays no
favorites;

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.880
North's as near as West.
 

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.073
More delicate than the
historians' are the map-makers'

00:24:19.073 --> 00:24:20.259
colors.
 

00:24:20.259 --> 00:24:23.380
 
 

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:31.040
It's a poetry like aspects
Yeats's – no,,

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:40.345
like aspects of Moore's,
that presents itself with a

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:50.195
kind of resolute clarity and
simplicity and lucidity of

00:24:50.195 --> 00:25:00.230
language that sometimes seems to
feel like prose.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:09.291
There is a lyric power here but
it's got at through a language,

00:25:09.291 --> 00:25:15.140
again, close to that of
ordinary life.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.924
As Bishop observes the
boundaries that she's talking

00:25:19.924 --> 00:25:25.555
about here – the sea and the
shore – she's also concerned

00:25:25.555 --> 00:25:30.997
with another set of opposed
terms and ones that will follow

00:25:30.997 --> 00:25:35.837
her throughout her poetry;
and that is the difference

00:25:35.837 --> 00:25:39.373
between the real and
representation and the ways in

00:25:39.373 --> 00:25:44.068
which representation,
that which is represented,

00:25:44.068 --> 00:25:49.145
can take on a certain kind of
reality itself,

00:25:49.145 --> 00:25:56.068
as she fancifully allows the
forms of the map to do here.

00:25:56.068 --> 00:26:03.029
The map really becomes a world
and not only a representation of

00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:09.990
it, and the poet plunges really
imaginatively into it--takes us

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.571
with her,
as she does,

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:17.720
entering the versions of life
that it suggests to her.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.173
In that third stanza there,
though, as she returns to that

00:26:22.173 --> 00:26:26.583
peculiar rhyme scheme,
there's a certain kind of

00:26:26.583 --> 00:26:31.040
holding back,
a gathering of her intelligence

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:37.019
in reflection on the process
that she's been engaged in.

00:26:37.019 --> 00:26:42.337
What emerges there is a kind of
key idea, the one I've already

00:26:42.337 --> 00:26:46.000
mentioned, geography or
topography here.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:54.078
Geography, topography:
they display "no favorites."

00:26:54.078 --> 00:27:00.453
They represent a poetics that
is non-hierarchical in its

00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:06.250
orientation and,
again, this is a link to Moore.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:12.695
Bishop is interested in a point
of view that takes no sides,

00:27:12.695 --> 00:27:16.084
except to suggest,
to insist on,

00:27:16.084 --> 00:27:21.220
the relativity of all cognitive
categories.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:25.118
"North's as near as West":
it always is,

00:27:25.118 --> 00:27:25.920
right?
 

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:31.201
That is, it's as near to the
perceiver, whose perspective is

00:27:31.201 --> 00:27:35.230
constantly shifting,
constantly readjusted.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:39.838
I talked about perspectivism in
Auden.

00:27:39.838 --> 00:27:46.457
Well, Bishop has a hold on the
same idea and will make it even

00:27:46.457 --> 00:27:50.579
more central,
make it more thematically

00:27:50.579 --> 00:27:54.920
central to her work than even
Auden.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:04.355
The opposition that she ends
with is the one between the

00:28:04.355 --> 00:28:09.328
historian and the mapmaker.
 

00:28:09.328 --> 00:28:14.252
She presents herself here
clearly on the side of the

00:28:14.252 --> 00:28:20.142
mapmaker, one whose colors –
colors of rhetoric – are more

00:28:20.142 --> 00:28:25.065
delicate than the historian's
and on the side of the

00:28:25.065 --> 00:28:27.930
historian;
who could we place?

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.963
Perhaps Yeats,
perhaps Pound,

00:28:31.963 --> 00:28:37.480
perhaps Eliot;
certainly Bishop's great

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.358
contemporary,
Robert Lowell.

00:28:41.358 --> 00:28:46.996
Bishop presents herself as
engaged in a poetics of

00:28:46.996 --> 00:28:53.898
geography and of mapmaking that
is more delicate than that of

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:55.970
the historian.
 

00:28:55.970 --> 00:29:02.784
In that word,
"delicacy," there is certainly

00:29:02.784 --> 00:29:07.380
some implication of gender.
 

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.780
The opposition between the
mapmaker and the historian:

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.765
well, it would be too simple to
call it an opposition between

00:29:16.765 --> 00:29:21.499
woman and man,
and yet gendered terms are

00:29:21.499 --> 00:29:26.108
there in Bishop's language,
I think.

00:29:26.108 --> 00:29:32.959
This poem, as I suggested,
is composed in 1933 after

00:29:32.959 --> 00:29:41.285
Bishop has left Vassar and has
made friends with Moore who will

00:29:41.285 --> 00:29:46.118
be a central figure in her life.
 

00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:53.060
If, in some sense,
emotion might exceed its cause,

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:58.303
might lead Bishop to get
carried away,

00:29:58.303 --> 00:30:05.670
there were lots of reasons why
this might be so.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:15.650
Bishop grew up at first in Nova
Scotia.

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:21.527
She is a Canadian poet as much
as an American poet – a poet

00:30:21.527 --> 00:30:26.230
of uncertain national identity,
you might say.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:31.000
Her father died when,
I believe, she was five.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.689
Her mother in grief went mad
and was institutionalized,

00:30:37.689 --> 00:30:44.874
and Bishop was separated from
her, so that she grew up very

00:30:44.874 --> 00:30:47.598
much as an orphan.
 

00:30:47.598 --> 00:30:51.269
Much has been made of her
biography.

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:58.471
I wouldn't encourage you to
because Bishop herself treats it

00:30:58.471 --> 00:31:04.573
as an important frame and
resonance for her poetry,

00:31:04.573 --> 00:31:09.088
but not as a rule as its
subject.

00:31:09.088 --> 00:31:13.965
There is, I think,
simply the important point to

00:31:13.965 --> 00:31:20.295
be made that here is a poet who
grew up with a certain primary

00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:24.858
sense of dislocation and
disorientation,

00:31:24.858 --> 00:31:30.491
and an acute sense of divided
identity: biographical facts

00:31:30.491 --> 00:31:35.330
that, in a sense,
lead us very quickly into the

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:41.252
ethical and cognitive problems
that are central to Bishop's

00:31:41.252 --> 00:31:46.005
work,
and I think to this problem in

00:31:46.005 --> 00:31:52.170
particular: how do you hold
yourself together?

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:58.423
It's an important one and one
that we all in various ways

00:31:58.423 --> 00:32:00.210
struggle with.
 

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:04.953
Bishop finds various ways to
raise that question,

00:32:04.953 --> 00:32:07.920
to figure it and explore it.
 

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:13.582
One early, amusing,
and suggestive instance is the

00:32:13.582 --> 00:32:18.318
poem called "The Gentleman of
Shalott."

00:32:18.318 --> 00:32:25.117
And I'd like to look at that
with you to get a little more

00:32:25.117 --> 00:32:31.320
sense of Bishop's poetics and
some sense of her early

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.900
self-conception as a poet.
 

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.007
Remember the idea that she's
taken from Eliot:

00:32:38.007 --> 00:32:42.219
she wants to imagine a kind of
writing that would include time

00:32:42.219 --> 00:32:45.364
in it,
that would include change in

00:32:45.364 --> 00:32:49.835
it, and in which the
organization of the whole would

00:32:49.835 --> 00:32:53.430
be constantly subject to
readjustment;

00:32:53.430 --> 00:33:00.402
a text that would incorporate
flux, a text that would be

00:33:00.402 --> 00:33:07.500
determined locally rather than
by some global and general

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.528
perspective.
 

00:33:09.528 --> 00:33:13.769
The, I think,
unstable orders of a poem like

00:33:13.769 --> 00:33:19.490
"Prufrock" are important for
Bishop in that Prufrock is,

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:22.991
in fact, a figure behind this
one of Bishop's,

00:33:22.991 --> 00:33:25.250
"The Gentleman of Shalott."
 

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:30.650
Bishop's character is a kind of
dandy, like Prufrock.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:35.863
Bishop is also at the same time
playing with Tennyson and his

00:33:35.863 --> 00:33:38.470
poem, "The Lady of Shalott."
 

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:44.359
A kind of gender switch has
occurred in Bishop's poem.

00:33:44.359 --> 00:33:45.808
What does it mean?
 

00:33:45.808 --> 00:33:49.849
Well, I'll leave you to ponder
it, but I think that one way to

00:33:49.849 --> 00:33:53.825
understand her joke here – I'm
not going to write about the

00:33:53.825 --> 00:33:57.220
lady of Shalott,
I'm going to write about the

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.805
gentleman of Shalott – one way
to understand her joke here is

00:34:01.805 --> 00:34:06.166
to suggest that this poem is in
part about what it means for

00:34:06.166 --> 00:34:12.356
Bishop to be a woman poet,
and it implies that that meant

00:34:12.356 --> 00:34:19.500
for her a certain kind of gender
switch, a sex change,

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:26.943
and one that might introduce a
certain amount of stress,

00:34:26.943 --> 00:34:29.650
as well as comedy.
 

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:34.849
Well let's listen to some of it.
 

00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:37.989
Which eye's his eye?
 

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:41.960
Which limb lies
next the mirror?

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:47.583
Her joke is that the gentleman
of Shalott, like the lady of

00:34:47.583 --> 00:34:54.391
Shalott, is fixated on a mirror,
but the mirror that is in place

00:34:54.391 --> 00:34:58.807
here is one that,
as she'll describe it,

00:34:58.807 --> 00:35:03.032
goes down the body,
splits this figure,

00:35:03.032 --> 00:35:06.500
and creates a kind of divided
figure.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:10.510
Which limb lies
next the mirror?

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:13.230
For neither is clearer
nor a different color

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.530
than the other,
nor meets a stranger

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.849
in this arrangement
of leg and leg and

00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:22.400
arm and so on.
 

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.530
To his mind
it's the indication

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.889
of a mirrored reflection
somewhere along the line

00:35:29.889 --> 00:35:32.880
of what we call the spine.
 

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.360
He felt in modesty
his person was

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.860
half looking-glass,
for why should he

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.840
be doubled?
 

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.480
The glass must stretch
down his middle,

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.889
or rather down the edge.
 

00:35:44.889 --> 00:35:50.719
But he's in doubt
as to which side's in or out

00:35:50.719 --> 00:35:52.840
of the mirror.
 

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:56.170
There's little margin for error,
but there's no proof, either.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:58.909
And if half his head's
reflected,

00:35:58.909 --> 00:36:03.239
thought, he thinks,
might be affected.

00:36:03.239 --> 00:36:07.909
This is poetry that presents
itself as light verse.

00:36:07.909 --> 00:36:12.626
In that way,
it's again like much of early

00:36:12.626 --> 00:36:19.530
Auden, and yet it is a poem that
is secretly very serious.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:24.641
Well, much of the lightness as
well as the seriousness of the

00:36:24.641 --> 00:36:28.219
poem depends on its formal
organization.

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:32.601
These lines are,
well, aren't they about half as

00:36:32.601 --> 00:36:36.050
long as a normative line of
poetry?

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:40.376
And they're rhymed,
but they're rhymed in a most

00:36:40.376 --> 00:36:43.139
interesting and playful way.
 

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:46.460
In fact, the poem has a lot of
play in it.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:50.947
The pleasure that it gives is
one of a certain mild

00:36:50.947 --> 00:36:56.748
exhilaration and uncertainty,
of a pattern that includes and

00:36:56.748 --> 00:37:00.873
that in fact tolerates,
or even generates,

00:37:00.873 --> 00:37:06.510
dramatic change in line length
and surprising rhymes.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:10.032
The gentleman is,
in a sense, trying to hold

00:37:10.032 --> 00:37:11.590
himself together.
 

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:17.704
The idea is repeated by the
poet trying to hold her lines

00:37:17.704 --> 00:37:20.980
together in rhymed couplets.
 

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:25.876
Bishop is, in general,
a very interesting poet

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:27.400
technically.
 

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.032
Here, as elsewhere,
how relaxed,

00:37:31.032 --> 00:37:37.244
how unpretentiously casual,
how disorientingly casual,

00:37:37.244 --> 00:37:39.940
even, the voice is!
 

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:45.472
There isn't here or elsewhere
in Bishop Frost's tension

00:37:45.472 --> 00:37:48.239
between speech and meter.
 

00:37:48.239 --> 00:37:54.818
Rather, as in this case,
each keeps getting adjusted to

00:37:54.818 --> 00:37:56.280
the other.
 

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.166
It's important;
there's almost no blank verse,

00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:02.679
no iambic pentameter in Bishop.
 

00:38:02.679 --> 00:38:07.322
The canonical heroic meter
doesn't appear here,

00:38:07.322 --> 00:38:11.157
except, I think,
possibly in one or two

00:38:11.157 --> 00:38:12.469
examples.
 

00:38:12.469 --> 00:38:16.610
There are in Bishop free verse
poems.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.199
There's meter and rhyme.
 

00:38:18.199 --> 00:38:22.632
There are often poems that move
in and out of these forms,

00:38:22.632 --> 00:38:26.755
much as "The Map" begins in
rhyme, moves out of rhyme,

00:38:26.755 --> 00:38:28.699
and returns to rhyme.
 

00:38:28.699 --> 00:38:34.221
The poems don't seek Moore's
highly idiosyncratic crafted

00:38:34.221 --> 00:38:36.389
formal arrangements.
 

00:38:36.389 --> 00:38:41.579
Instead, Bishop's practice is
probably closest to Auden's,

00:38:41.579 --> 00:38:46.586
who's got a form for every
occasion and a form for every

00:38:46.586 --> 00:38:47.679
purpose.
 

00:38:47.679 --> 00:38:51.592
But Auden's forms are always in
a sense pre-set,

00:38:51.592 --> 00:38:54.590
drawn from an existing
repertoire.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.250
What is right for this occasion?
 

00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:00.489
A ballad – I will do a
ballad, a sestina,

00:39:00.489 --> 00:39:03.619
elegiac quatrains,
et cetera.

00:39:03.619 --> 00:39:08.199
That's the way in which Auden
presents himself.

00:39:08.199 --> 00:39:14.235
And Auden adheres strictly to
his forms, and he uses those

00:39:14.235 --> 00:39:20.590
forms to shape and interpret the
occasions of his writing.

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:23.460
In Bishop's case,
it's really just the other way

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.010
around.
 

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:29.887
What she does is alter her
forms under the pressure of the

00:39:29.887 --> 00:39:35.250
occasions of her writing,
her purpose and subject.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:38.820
Nothing in Bishop is pre-set.
 

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:43.717
Everything is provisional,
in the process of being remade,

00:39:43.717 --> 00:39:48.614
and in the process of constant
readjustment on a technical

00:39:48.614 --> 00:39:53.340
level as well as on the
perceptual level that I began by

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.059
talking about.
 

00:39:55.059 --> 00:40:00.815
This is a vision really of what
the world is like and how

00:40:00.815 --> 00:40:03.900
writing might respond to it.
 

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:09.494
All of these things are going
on in this little poem,

00:40:09.494 --> 00:40:15.630
"The Gentleman of Shallot",
and with a sense of comedy.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:18.829
If the glass slips
he's in a fix--

00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:20.579
only one leg, etc.
 

00:40:20.579 --> 00:40:23.880
But
while it stays put [so long as

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.190
we accept this provisional
arrangement]

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:31.269
he can walk and run
and his hands can clasp one

00:40:31.269 --> 00:40:33.170
another.
 

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:35.340
The uncertainty
he says he

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.079
finds exhilarating.
 

00:40:38.079 --> 00:40:43.230
He loves [and here's that
phrase from the essay on Eliot]

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:45.900
that sense of constant
re-adjustment.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:49.150
He wishes to be quoted as
saying at present:

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:54.572
"Half is enough."
A kind of motto that Bishop

00:40:54.572 --> 00:40:57.150
might have adopted,
too.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:02.927
Let's look at another version
of this figure,

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:08.179
this time not a person but a
creature,

00:41:08.179 --> 00:41:16.692
and I mean specifically the
sandpiper who appears in a much

00:41:16.692 --> 00:41:22.710
later book, Questions of
Travel,

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:29.449
from a book written largely in
the 1950s and early 1960s.

00:41:29.449 --> 00:41:34.449
"Sandpiper" is on page 131.
 

00:41:34.449 --> 00:41:41.880
Again, it is a poem that takes
place on the shore.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:49.295
Instead of the gentleman of
Shalott in his fussy way,

00:41:49.295 --> 00:41:56.282
and yet practical way,
getting along in the world,

00:41:56.282 --> 00:42:02.130
we are introduced to a finicky
bird:

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:06.360
The roaring alongside he
takes for granted,

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.820
and that every so often the
world is bound to shake.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:16.860
He runs, he runs to the south,
finical, awkward,

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:22.449
in a sense of controlled panic,
a student of Blake.

00:42:22.449 --> 00:42:28.438
Another poem that is stationed
on a shifting boundary,

00:42:28.438 --> 00:42:31.489
the boundary of the tide.
 

00:42:31.489 --> 00:42:36.112
Bishop is engaged here in a
kind of playful,

00:42:36.112 --> 00:42:41.702
active revision of the
visionary innocence celebrated

00:42:41.702 --> 00:42:43.960
by William Blake.
 

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:49.885
I quote the lines on your
handout that Bishop is referring

00:42:49.885 --> 00:42:52.318
to:
To see a world in a grain

00:42:52.318 --> 00:42:55.820
of sand [this is the beginning
of "Auguries of Innocence"],

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:59.394
And heaven in a wildflower,
Hold infinity in the palm of

00:42:59.394 --> 00:43:02.849
your hand,
And eternity in an hour.

00:43:02.849 --> 00:43:05.849
Well, here, Bishop is sort of
playfully saying:

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:08.849
well, what kind of figure is
really Blakean?

00:43:08.849 --> 00:43:11.128
What kind of figure wants to
see the world in a grain of

00:43:11.128 --> 00:43:11.420
sand?
 

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:15.260
Well, a sandpiper,
looking for his food.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.269
The beach hisses like fat.
 

00:43:18.269 --> 00:43:23.094
On his left, a sheet
of interrupting water comes and

00:43:23.094 --> 00:43:25.570
goes
and glazes over his dark and

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:26.639
brittle feet.
 

00:43:26.639 --> 00:43:30.980
He runs, he runs straight
through it, watching his toes.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.940
- Watching, rather [and this is
again Bishop

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:38.072
correcting--proceeding by
correcting her perception],

00:43:38.072 --> 00:43:40.849
the spaces of sand between
them,

00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:44.342
where (no detail too small)
[and again the sandpiper,

00:43:44.342 --> 00:43:45.619
like the poet,
is

00:43:45.619 --> 00:43:48.340
focused on detail]
the Atlantic drains

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.739
rapidly backwards and downwards.
 

00:43:50.739 --> 00:43:55.349
As he runs,
he stares at the dragging

00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:56.010
grains.
 

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:58.909
The world is a mist.
 

00:43:58.909 --> 00:44:04.510
And then the world is
minute and vast and clear.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:06.909
The tide
is higher or lower.

00:44:06.909 --> 00:44:09.170
He couldn't tell you which.
 

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:13.260
["North's near as West."]
His beak is focussed;

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.514
he is preoccupied,
looking for something,

00:44:16.514 --> 00:44:18.199
something, something.
 

00:44:18.199 --> 00:44:20.900
Poor bird, he is obsessed!
 

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.724
The millions of grains are
black, white,

00:44:25.724 --> 00:44:29.465
tan, and gray
mixed with quartz grains,

00:44:29.465 --> 00:44:31.349
rose and amethyst.
 

00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:36.369
 
 

00:44:36.369 --> 00:44:43.543
The poem's own structure shifts
interestingly in terms of its

00:44:43.543 --> 00:44:49.759
line lengths and Bishop's ways
of using enjambment or

00:44:49.759 --> 00:44:52.389
end-stopped lines.
 

00:44:52.389 --> 00:45:00.418
The world is – well,
the place is a world of vast

00:45:00.418 --> 00:45:05.880
forces, of roaring,
and of mist,

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:12.108
and yet it's also minute and
clear – all of these things at

00:45:12.108 --> 00:45:14.599
once or in succession.
 

00:45:14.599 --> 00:45:19.829
The bird's perspective can't
tell us whether the tide is

00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:25.251
higher or lower because he is,
as it were, in the picture:

00:45:25.251 --> 00:45:28.199
he's always wherever it is.
 

00:45:28.199 --> 00:45:33.329
It is a position again of
constant readjustment.

00:45:33.329 --> 00:45:36.050
What is he looking for?
 

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:40.190
"Something, something,
something."

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:47.375
A calculatedly vague word,
a word that we see Frost using

00:45:47.375 --> 00:45:51.610
in "For Once,
Then, Something."

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:57.228
Instead of moving here towards
generalization,

00:45:57.228 --> 00:46:03.469
the poem moves towards more
detail: towards a list,

00:46:03.469 --> 00:46:08.340
a series finally of colors,
simply.

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:16.023
In a sense, Bishop moves away
from the black and white to

00:46:16.023 --> 00:46:20.414
other shades,
shades that involve

00:46:20.414 --> 00:46:24.119
combinations of colors.
 

00:46:24.119 --> 00:46:31.815
The question is really,
how can the world be seen

00:46:31.815 --> 00:46:33.579
serially?
 

00:46:33.579 --> 00:46:35.840
How can it be made?
 

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:41.559
How can it be seen as a series
of perceptions,

00:46:41.559 --> 00:46:45.119
and yet be able to cohere?
 

00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:49.789
This is a fundamental question
of Bishop's poetry.

00:46:49.789 --> 00:46:52.775
It is, as it were,
the complement of the question:

00:46:52.775 --> 00:46:55.030
how can you hold yourself
together?

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:57.768
Well, how can you hold the
world together,

00:46:57.768 --> 00:47:01.510
how can you hold the world that
you perceive together?

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:07.199
Bishop's great poem on this
subject is the travel poem,

00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:13.099
"Over 2,000 Illustrations and a
Complete Concordance,"

00:47:13.099 --> 00:47:22.000
which I promise to talk about
on Monday.

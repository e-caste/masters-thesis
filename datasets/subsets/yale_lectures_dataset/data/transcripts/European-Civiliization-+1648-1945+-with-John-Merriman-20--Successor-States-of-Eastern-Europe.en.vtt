00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.314
Prof: Today I'm going to
do a fairly impossible task,

00:00:04.314 --> 00:00:08.069
which is to talk mostly about
Eastern Europe in the interwar

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:08.770
period.
 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.846
I sent around a rather lengthy
list of terms,

00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:16.040
so I don't have to write it on
the board and you can't see it

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.810
anyway.
 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.550
I'll work from that,
so it'll help you understand.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.360
But the big points are clear,
and the maps will help you as

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.820
well.
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.014
Just a couple things at the
beginning, which are perfectly

00:00:29.014 --> 00:00:29.400
obvious.
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.087
In 1914, few people could have
imagined that they would sweep

00:00:34.087 --> 00:00:36.510
away four empires,
etc., etc.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.430
and take the lives of millions
of people.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:47.720
In 1918 and 1919 there was the
Great Illusion.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.622
The Great Illusion was held by
Wilson and lots of other people,

00:00:51.622 --> 00:00:54.895
that wars were started by evil
people in high places,

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:56.910
which may often be the case.
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:06.471
But the problems left by the
Treaty of Versailles were

00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:10.438
basically insoluble.
 

00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:16.902
The 1920s and 1930s are
basically a continuation of the

00:01:16.902 --> 00:01:17.620
war.
 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.825
You can look at the entire
period from 1914 to 1945 as a

00:01:22.825 --> 00:01:24.720
thirty years' war.
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.275
Europe was in depression
basically the entire time

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:31.688
between the wars,
as we'll see when I talk about

00:01:31.688 --> 00:01:34.810
Eastern Europe and East Central
Europe.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.717
That has a lot to do with the
chronic instability of the

00:01:39.717 --> 00:01:40.519
period.
 

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:46.319
Western Europe and the United
States were really not in

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.080
depression between 1924 and
1929.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.190
Then the thunder comes in 1929.
 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.741
The United States doesn't get
out of the Depression until

00:01:57.741 --> 00:01:58.879
basically World War II.
 

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:04.609
The war economy helps them do
that.

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.200
But Eastern Europe,
in the places where the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.985
instability and the lack of
parliamentary traditions was so

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:13.967
important,
was in agricultural depression

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.139
the entire time.
 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:23.790
By 1939 in Central and Eastern
Europe, only one state,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.789
Czechoslovakia,
remains a parliamentary regime.

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:36.699
In all of the others,
the Eastern Europe of little

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.348
dictators,
and fascist parties,

00:02:39.348 --> 00:02:44.115
and rightwing agrarian populist
parties--some of them didn't

00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:48.720
start out rightwing--poisoned
the political atmosphere.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.448
The Treaty of Versailles,
when they meet and these

00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:57.240
delegations meet--including the
former president of Yale,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.530
the future president of Yale
then,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.330
Charles Seymour,
was in the American delegation

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.604
there--they were convinced that
they could put an end to all

00:03:08.604 --> 00:03:09.318
wars.
 

00:03:09.318 --> 00:03:12.074
They would get Germany to sign
on the dotted line saying,

00:03:12.074 --> 00:03:13.650
"We started it all."
 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.038
As I'll argue next week,
and it's perfectly clear,

00:03:17.038 --> 00:03:19.389
that was a catastrophic
mistake.

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.632
Germany arguably had a greater
role in starting the war than

00:03:23.632 --> 00:03:26.896
the other places,
but this guaranteed the

00:03:26.896 --> 00:03:31.665
perpetual hostility of an ever
increasing number of rightwing

00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:34.450
parties,
of which the most vicious and

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.038
the most successful would be the
Nazis,

00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:42.099
opposed the very existence of
the Weimar Republic and became,

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.370
as I'll explain a minute,
a revisionist state.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.134
A revisionist state is one that
wanted to revise the Treaty of

00:03:49.134 --> 00:03:51.686
Versailles,
because people of their

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:55.940
dominant ethnic group had ended
up on the wrong side of the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.818
frontier.
 

00:03:56.818 --> 00:04:03.847
If you had fought a war that
was based upon national claims

00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:07.100
in 1914,
in which aggressive nationalism

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.580
was one of the root causes of
the war,

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.594
the successor states that are
created out of these collapsed

00:04:15.594 --> 00:04:21.713
empires find themselves facing
the reality that you could get

00:04:21.713 --> 00:04:25.677
all the maps you wanted,
and you could get all the

00:04:25.677 --> 00:04:27.899
cartographers that you wanted,
and geographers,

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:29.120
and bring them all to
Versailles,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.915
and bring them all to the
French suburbs,

00:04:31.915 --> 00:04:34.641
Trianon, and SÃ¨vres,
and Neuilly,

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.440
and the others,
Saint-Germain-en-Laye,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.516
that became named after the
treaties with the individual

00:04:40.516 --> 00:04:41.019
powers.
 

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:45.112
But you couldn't draw lines
around national groups that were

00:04:45.112 --> 00:04:49.065
going to incorporate everybody
within the country of their

00:04:49.065 --> 00:04:49.829
choice.
 

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:50.850
You couldn't do it.
 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.740
That leaves a permanent factor
for instability.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.836
If you don't believe me,
look at the Balkans in the

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:07.704
1990s,
which were the worst atrocities

00:05:07.704 --> 00:05:12.459
since the death camps in World
War II,

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:18.252
in which ethnic cleansing and
rape as a means of waging war

00:05:18.252 --> 00:05:22.689
became a reality again,
and in which those old hatreds

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.470
had never been extinguished.
 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.129
So, the Great Illusion was that
there wouldn't be anymore wars.

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.970
In the case of Germany,
as we'll see,

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.360
the troops who were
demobilized,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.899
who came back,
they kept drilling in their

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:39.529
basements, the Freikorps,
the Free Corps in Germany.

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:45.190
Lots of people among them,
just one of millions,

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.721
the young Adolf Hitler--the
view that they held was that the

00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:54.329
problem wasn't to have fought
the war in the first place,

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:56.120
which was a Wilsonian view of
the war,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.810
but the problem was not to have
won the war.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.524
The problem is,
how do you explain to home that

00:06:00.524 --> 00:06:03.122
you've lost the war when your
troops are far,

00:06:03.122 --> 00:06:04.480
far inside Germany?
 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.802
I'm getting ahead of my story,
but it's just such a

00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:09.930
complicated subject,
all this.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.519
It's a little hard not to.
 

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:15.334
The other problem was,
if you're punishing losers in

00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:19.276
World War I,
you're often punishing them in

00:06:19.276 --> 00:06:24.747
a way that seems to violate the
very principle that you hope to

00:06:24.747 --> 00:06:28.350
espouse of each people,
more or less their own country.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.273
The powers that become the
revisionist powers,

00:06:32.273 --> 00:06:35.500
almost all were on the losing
side.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.019
They're the ones that,
by the very principles espoused

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:41.942
at Versailles,
that basically just simply get

00:06:41.942 --> 00:06:42.740
screwed.
 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.971
As the Hungarians put it,
"No, no,

00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:48.529
never."
 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:51.307
That was their response,
"No, no,

00:06:51.307 --> 00:06:52.360
never."
 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.975
These powers,
of which the most dangerous,

00:06:55.975 --> 00:06:59.526
ultimately, is Germany,
are far more powerful in defeat

00:06:59.526 --> 00:07:03.500
than France is in victory,
basically vow to get even.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.762
Not the Weimar Republic,
but those people who wanted to

00:07:07.762 --> 00:07:09.579
destroy the republic.
 

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:12.439
Then Eastern Europe will be
full of little Hitlers,

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:18.899
little racist dictators who are
also convinced that "in the

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:21.180
next one,
we'll get it back."

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.545
"We'll get it all back and
we'll bring it back with a

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.850
percentage of interest as
well."

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.045
Increasingly,
a point that I'd better make in

00:07:30.045 --> 00:07:34.185
a while, they begin to look at,
in the Europe of extremes,

00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:37.019
Germany as a very compelling
model.

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:40.980
The Eastern European states
that had certainly reasons to

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.940
increasingly fear Germany,
they begin to see Germany as a

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.920
rather successful model.
 

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.805
The Europe of the extremes,
as Eric Hobsbawm has called it,

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.711
is basically,
if you exclude the Soviet

00:07:55.711 --> 00:07:57.959
Union,
which is another kind of

00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:01.154
totalitarian state,
and if you exclude the role of

00:08:01.154 --> 00:08:04.355
the Communist parties as a
destabilizing force in many of

00:08:04.355 --> 00:08:07.680
these countries,
is a Europe of fascism.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.470
They just keep right on
marching,

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:17.362
because fascists are better at
describing how they will take

00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:22.430
power--marching,
violence--and whom they hate,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.629
than what they will construct
afterward.

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:30.839
What they will construct
afterward in all of these places

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:35.235
will be a totalitarian,
fascist state that is based

00:08:35.235 --> 00:08:38.529
upon the principle of totally
over-the-top,

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:42.070
aggressive nationalism and
anti-whatever the minorities

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.629
are,
particularly the Jews.

00:08:44.629 --> 00:08:49.269
Anti-Semitism becomes an
important part of all of this.

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:52.249
So, the guys with the maps,
and the pencils,

00:08:52.249 --> 00:08:56.061
and trying to draw the little
squiggly lines--it doesn't

00:08:56.061 --> 00:08:58.139
really work out very well.
 

00:08:58.139 --> 00:09:03.211
Wilson comes back in utter
defeat and the American congress

00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:07.668
doesn't approve the Treaty of
Versailles anyway,

00:09:07.668 --> 00:09:09.730
and America enters,
as you know,

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:14.678
a period of isolationism,
at least until the next time

00:09:14.678 --> 00:09:15.538
around.
 

00:09:15.538 --> 00:09:19.177
That was a rather lengthy
introduction to what I was going

00:09:19.177 --> 00:09:20.200
to talk about.
 

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.788
Let's try to be more specific
now.

00:09:25.788 --> 00:09:32.399
What are the big-time
revisionist states?

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:35.700
First, let me just start out
with one that didn't lose,

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.538
but is one in which,
as you'll see when you read the

00:09:39.538 --> 00:09:43.283
chapter,
where fascism is first saluted

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:45.750
and then takes power.
 

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.879
That is Italy.
 

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:48.120
Italy wins.
 

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.711
They're open to offers,
open to the highest bidder,

00:09:51.711 --> 00:09:55.732
and they join in 1915 because
the Allies can promise them

00:09:55.732 --> 00:09:56.379
more.
 

00:09:56.379 --> 00:10:00.827
They promise them part of the
Tyrol between Austria and Italy,

00:10:00.827 --> 00:10:04.620
and they promise them much of
the Dalmatian Coast.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:11.190
Italy went to war for that
reason,

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.091
but also because in a country
in which a sense of national

00:10:14.091 --> 00:10:17.443
unity basically didn't exist,
there was a strong feeling that

00:10:17.443 --> 00:10:20.668
war will make Italians out of
all these different people.

00:10:20.668 --> 00:10:23.724
That's not real good reason to
go to war, but they do go to

00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:24.038
war.
 

00:10:24.038 --> 00:10:28.750
Of course, they were being
systematically denigrated by the

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:33.379
other Allied leaders for woeful
aspects of their army,

00:10:33.379 --> 00:10:39.893
which also took huge losses
fighting the Austro-Hungarian

00:10:39.893 --> 00:10:40.940
forces.
 

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.312
So, when they come to
Versailles, Orlando,

00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:49.330
who is their representative,
he's a junior partner in this.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.918
They don't pay a lot of
attention to him.

00:10:50.918 --> 00:10:54.109
Wilson says,
"You can't give them the

00:10:54.109 --> 00:10:56.378
Tyrol,
because they don't have Italian

00:10:56.378 --> 00:10:59.059
majorities there and they
certainly don't have Italian

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:01.994
majorities in the Dalmatian
Coast," which is populated

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:05.379
by,
logically enough, by Croats.

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:07.532
So, they don't get what they
want.

00:11:07.532 --> 00:11:10.177
Mussolini,
who began his career as a

00:11:10.177 --> 00:11:12.011
socialist,
he was the editor of

00:11:12.011 --> 00:11:14.289
Avanti!,
"Forward,"

00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:18.182
which was the socialist paper,
he becomes one of the

00:11:18.182 --> 00:11:21.830
originators of fascism,
and he appeared,

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.216
as you'll see in the book,
on the cover of Time

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:25.110
magazine eight times.
 

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.524
He's the guy that got the
railroads to run on time in

00:11:27.524 --> 00:11:29.658
Italy, but only the ones to the
ski resorts.

00:11:29.658 --> 00:11:33.950
Anyway, I don't have time to
talk about him now.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.360
So, they're kind of a
revisionist power.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.410
Mussolini's discourse about how
he's going to turn the

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.600
Mediterranean into an Italian
lake,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.519
revive the Roman Empire,
and all that has to be seen in

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:45.139
that context.
 

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:50.153
Italy was not "a
loser" in World War I,

00:11:50.153 --> 00:11:53.600
but rather an aggrieved winner.
 

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.450
I guess that's a good way of
putting it.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:00.149
The revisionist powers are
those that lost.

00:12:00.149 --> 00:12:05.961
Revisionist powers,
of course, no one was more

00:12:05.961 --> 00:12:12.291
revisionist than Germany,
and the German Empire is

00:12:12.291 --> 00:12:14.100
destroyed.
 

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.798
Germany, again it's hard to
summarize all of this,

00:12:17.798 --> 00:12:21.230
but Germany from the very
beginning says,

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:26.596
"If you're going to argue
that national ethnic groups and

00:12:26.596 --> 00:12:32.048
where they live should determine
the drawing of boundaries,

00:12:32.048 --> 00:12:37.559
then what the Allies did to
Germany seemed extremely

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:42.099
unfair,"
and not only to the far right

00:12:42.099 --> 00:12:43.720
in Germany.
 

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.639
This leaves aside the question
that I'll come to next week.

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:49.022
John Maynard Keynes,
who was a brilliant,

00:12:49.022 --> 00:12:51.643
brilliant guy,
he's the one who saw that this

00:12:51.643 --> 00:12:54.798
is recipe for disaster,
the Treaty of Versailles.

00:12:54.798 --> 00:12:56.450
He's the one who said,
"This is just a truce.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:57.980
It's not the end of the war.
 

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.798
If you make Germany pay for the
whole war,

00:13:00.798 --> 00:13:03.548
based on that they've signed
the war guilt clause,

00:13:03.548 --> 00:13:06.234
you're going to so destabilize
this country that eventually the

00:13:06.234 --> 00:13:07.490
right will take over."
 

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.730
That's exactly what happened.
 

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.259
That's exactly what happened.
 

00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:15.479
From the point of view of
Germany, the most egregious loss

00:13:15.479 --> 00:13:19.600
that they suffered was the
Polish Corridor.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.798
If you go to Gdansk,
which is a wonderful city,

00:13:22.798 --> 00:13:25.702
which was destroyed during the
war like most every city in

00:13:25.702 --> 00:13:28.950
Poland except for Krakow,
which really got lucky.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.687
I can remember going to Warsaw,
au temps des camarades,

00:13:33.687 --> 00:13:37.028
when it was still into the
communist regime,

00:13:37.028 --> 00:13:38.658
when I was a kid.
 

00:13:38.658 --> 00:13:41.820
You could see where there once
had been boulevards.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.600
The whole place was just
absolutely razed.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.139
Krakow was very lucky because
it survived.

00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:49.110
What they do is Gdansk gets
rebuilt.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.470
Gdansk was a German city.
 

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.100
The Polish population was
extremely small.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.129
You may know of Gdansk because
that's where Solidarity began in

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.168
1979 and 1980.
 

00:13:59.168 --> 00:14:00.700
There's an important port
there,

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.490
and that's where Lech Walesa
got his start,

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:03.940
and the whole Solidarity
movement,

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.769
including some of my friends,
historians,

00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:10.269
who were young printers for
Solidarity in those days.

00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:12.725
As I've said a couple of times,
I go to Poland all the time,

00:14:12.725 --> 00:14:15.014
in the last couple of years
five times or something like

00:14:15.014 --> 00:14:15.389
that.
 

00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:18.590
Anyway, Gdansk,
from the point of view of the

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.190
Germans, was German.
 

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.288
The vast majority of the
population was German.

00:14:23.288 --> 00:14:27.712
What the Germans called
"the Polish Corridor"

00:14:27.712 --> 00:14:32.710
divided the rest of Germany
from Pomerania in East Prussia.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:38.422
It was resented by the Germans
because there was a strong

00:14:38.422 --> 00:14:41.889
German population that remained.
 

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:44.221
Of course the Poles,
when they look at Gdansk,

00:14:44.221 --> 00:14:47.124
they look back to when Gdansk
was an important port then,

00:14:47.124 --> 00:14:49.558
too, in the Polish-Lithuanian
commonwealth.

00:14:49.558 --> 00:14:51.149
In fact, Poles are quite
insistent.

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:55.837
Polish historians--and the
whole concept of sovereignty

00:14:55.837 --> 00:15:01.134
that emerged in the Netherlands
and in England in early-modern

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:06.168
times was also being constructed
in and around Gdansk.

00:15:06.168 --> 00:15:12.720
The other big wound for the
Germans was Czechoslovakia.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.476
The second largest ethnic group
in the newly one of the

00:15:17.476 --> 00:15:21.148
successor states,
along with Poland and

00:15:21.148 --> 00:15:23.840
Yugoslavia,
and I have the statistics in

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.629
what I sent around to you,
the first were Czechs at about

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:28.769
fifty percent.
 

00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:32.105
Germans, if I remember
correctly, were twenty-three

00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:35.039
percent, and Slovaks were
sixteen percent.

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:36.798
The others are other minorities.
 

00:15:36.798 --> 00:15:40.110
They're Ukrainians,
and Poles, and all sorts of

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.759
things.
 

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:44.481
The majority of Germans were
concentrated in Prague,

00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:48.058
though there weren't as many of
them as before.

00:15:48.058 --> 00:15:53.215
Above all, the whole region of
Bohemia and in that region

00:15:53.215 --> 00:15:57.450
called Sudetenland,
the Sudetenland Germans.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:02.974
When the allies capitulate to
Hitler's demands that that part

00:16:02.974 --> 00:16:07.947
of Czechoslovakia--then of
course he launched the whole

00:16:07.947 --> 00:16:11.168
thing--;be passed into Germany.
 

00:16:11.168 --> 00:16:13.081
One of the reasons that they
appease is they said,

00:16:13.081 --> 00:16:14.288
"Maybe he's got a point.
 

00:16:14.288 --> 00:16:17.648
In 1918, we couldn't really put
the people where they were

00:16:17.648 --> 00:16:18.649
supposed to be.
 

00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:24.620
There are German majorities in
a good percentage of Bohemia,

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.049
within Czechoslovakia.
 

00:16:27.049 --> 00:16:28.370
Maybe he's got a point."
 

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.428
That was an excuse.
 

00:16:29.428 --> 00:16:31.365
That was the rationale for
appeasing him,

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:33.690
but at a time when he might
have been stopped.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:37.600
His generals were just scared
to death that the Allies were

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.970
going to fight them,
because they weren't ready for

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:41.509
war.
 

00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:44.870
Germany is, above all,
the big revisionist power.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:51.288
More about this when we talk
about Adolf Hitler next week.

00:16:51.288 --> 00:17:03.659
The other big one--I can't find
it but it's in there--is

00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:05.910
Hungary.
 

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:10.339
Hungary loses--I've got to
remember these statistics.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:11.589
I might have put it around.
 

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:13.640
I think I can remember them.
 

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:19.332
They lose twenty-five percent
of the Hungarian population to

00:17:19.332 --> 00:17:20.778
other states.
 

00:17:20.778 --> 00:17:26.009
They lose about between a half
and two-thirds,

00:17:26.009 --> 00:17:29.884
I should remember but I don't,
of the land of the old

00:17:29.884 --> 00:17:36.279
Hungarian domains when they were
in Austria-Hungary,

00:17:36.279 --> 00:17:39.930
when they were,
supposedly after 1867,

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:46.930
the equal partner of Austria.
 

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:51.260
They lose the greatest
percentage of that Hungarian

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.338
population to Romania.
 

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:58.857
The tensions between the
Romanians and the Hungarians

00:17:58.857 --> 00:18:01.298
were extremely great.
 

00:18:01.298 --> 00:18:05.479
The linguistic differences are
enormous, because Hungarian is

00:18:05.479 --> 00:18:07.430
such a difficult language.
 

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.950
It's an isolated language.
 

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:14.087
I have a friend who retired
here many years ago from Russian

00:18:14.087 --> 00:18:19.400
and East European languages and
literatures who knows eighteen

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.618
languages.
 

00:18:20.618 --> 00:18:25.220
He knows mostly every Central
European language.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.328
I said, "Do you know
Hungarian?"

00:18:26.328 --> 00:18:27.818
He said, "No,
it's too hard."

00:18:27.818 --> 00:18:31.930
That accentuates this isolation
from the Romanians.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:38.747
Again, in 1989 the great
groundswell against Ceausescu

00:18:38.747 --> 00:18:44.029
and his horrendous wife,
the dictators in Romania,

00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:49.952
began with Hungarian dissidents
whose families had been

00:18:49.952 --> 00:18:54.230
generations since World War I
stuck,

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.200
from their point of view,
in Romania.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.503
When you're trying to look at
each of these countries and

00:19:01.503 --> 00:19:05.424
trying to figure out why does
some rightwing maggot,

00:19:05.424 --> 00:19:08.500
some rightwing dictator,
take power?

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.108
It's because,
as in the case of Adolf Hitler,

00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:14.310
if you say the same thing over
and over and over again,

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.039
pretty soon you get people to
believe you.

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:21.864
Admiral Horthy,
who was an admiral in the

00:19:21.864 --> 00:19:25.365
Austro-Hungarian Empire,
he becomes an extraordinarily

00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:30.304
vicious dictator and egregious
collaborator during World War

00:19:30.304 --> 00:19:33.269
II,
sort of an admiring junior

00:19:33.269 --> 00:19:38.828
partner of Hitler and the Nazis,
and the frenetic,

00:19:38.828 --> 00:19:41.920
aggressive Hungarian
nationalism.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:49.452
You can go to Budapest,
go along the Danube River in

00:19:49.452 --> 00:19:53.958
Budapest and see where they've
made a sad monument out of the

00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:58.238
shoes of Jews who were shot or
just simply pushed into the

00:19:58.238 --> 00:20:03.420
swirling waters of the Danube by
the Hungarian fascists in 1944.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:08.230
I'm not saying Hungarians as a
people, obviously not.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.990
I have Hungarian friends and I
love Hungary.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.720
Budapest is my third favorite
city.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:17.938
But the damages done by
revisionist claims in Hungary

00:20:17.938 --> 00:20:20.568
were simply amazing.
 

00:20:20.568 --> 00:20:23.028
Of all of the--after the
Germans,

00:20:23.028 --> 00:20:24.930
arguably even more than
Germans,

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.608
they had the most to be
aggrieved about,

00:20:28.608 --> 00:20:35.748
because of losing so much of
their country awarded--because

00:20:35.748 --> 00:20:39.809
they had lost--to other places.
 

00:20:39.809 --> 00:20:41.970
Now, the case of Austria, also.
 

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.196
If you go to Vienna,
it's such a wonderful,

00:20:45.196 --> 00:20:48.577
huge, musical place full of
baroque, baroque,

00:20:48.577 --> 00:20:49.500
baroque.
 

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.190
It's really a great city.
 

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.497
You think, "Oh,
this is an enormous city for

00:20:54.497 --> 00:20:55.940
such a little country."
 

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.776
What happens when the
Austrian-Hungarian Empire is

00:20:59.776 --> 00:21:04.003
dismembered, Austria becomes a
small and overwhelmingly

00:21:04.003 --> 00:21:06.038
German-speaking state.
 

00:21:06.038 --> 00:21:10.396
There are, comparatively,
very few ethnic minorities

00:21:10.396 --> 00:21:14.670
living in what became Austria
after World War I.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.009
It's an imperial city.
 

00:21:16.009 --> 00:21:20.435
It's an imperial city not
reduced in size,

00:21:20.435 --> 00:21:23.460
but reduced in importance.
 

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:32.682
So, Hungary has huge reasons to
be extraordinarily angry by the

00:21:32.682 --> 00:21:34.467
whole thing.
 

00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:36.548
Yugoslavia.
 

00:21:36.548 --> 00:21:42.987
Yugoslavia loses some land that
they wish that they would have

00:21:42.987 --> 00:21:47.737
gotten, but again,
in Yugoslavia you have this

00:21:47.737 --> 00:21:51.220
tremendous ethnic complexity.
 

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.325
In a way, the successor state
of Yugoslavia--maybe some of you

00:21:55.325 --> 00:21:57.950
have or will take Ivo Banac's
course.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.298
He's a great Balkan historian.
 

00:22:00.298 --> 00:22:02.490
The ethnic complexity,
of course,

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.509
is sort of a mini version of
the Austrian-Hungarian Empire,

00:22:06.509 --> 00:22:11.214
where Serbs were something like
forty percent of the population

00:22:11.214 --> 00:22:13.720
of Yugoslavia between the wars.
 

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.298
That would be really about the
percentage until the whole thing

00:22:18.298 --> 00:22:20.588
collapses in the early 1990s.
 

00:22:20.588 --> 00:22:25.019
The Croats were the next
largest percentage,

00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:30.270
followed by Slovenes,
who were the wealthiest region

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.980
and remained that until the end.
 

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.788
The standard of living in
Slovenia in the 1980s was about

00:22:38.788 --> 00:22:42.250
that of Italy,
where if you went far,

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.500
far down to Kosovo,
where I've been,

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.960
about where so much has been
going on,

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.569
and which now has been
proclaimed independent,

00:22:51.569 --> 00:22:53.759
it was absolutely impoverished.
 

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:58.903
So, the ethnic complexity is,
in itself, going to be a factor

00:22:58.903 --> 00:23:00.789
for destabilization.
 

00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:02.390
What about Poland?
 

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:09.374
Poland had not been independent
since 1795, since the Third

00:23:09.374 --> 00:23:10.818
Partition.
 

00:23:10.818 --> 00:23:13.461
You had, as I've already
discussed in other contexts,

00:23:13.461 --> 00:23:15.190
you've got Polish
intellectuals.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:19.957
You've got political militants
in the 1830s and again in the

00:23:19.957 --> 00:23:24.240
1860s who don't want to be part
of congress Russia.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.470
They don't want to be congress
Poland.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.038
They don't want to be part of
the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.

00:23:28.038 --> 00:23:29.170
They don't want to be part of
Prussia.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.538
They want and dream of the
independent Poland.

00:23:31.538 --> 00:23:40.130
They get their independence in
1918, immediately.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.538
But the complexity is enormous
there.

00:23:43.538 --> 00:23:49.319
You've already got these ethnic
minorities who are there.

00:23:49.319 --> 00:23:50.578
The Germans are there.
 

00:23:50.578 --> 00:23:52.838
You've got huge numbers of
Ukrainians.

00:23:52.838 --> 00:23:57.700
In fact, in Eastern Poland the
cities like Zamosc,

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.779
where Rosa Luxemburg was born,
which is a beautiful city,

00:24:00.779 --> 00:24:04.721
these are Polish cities,
but the vast majority of the

00:24:04.721 --> 00:24:07.569
rural population are Ukrainian.
 

00:24:07.569 --> 00:24:09.690
They are Ukrainian.
 

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.410
This was a force of
"instability."

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:17.799
They will be killing each other
off during World War II.

00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:21.730
The other minority is the Jews.
 

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:28.568
How many Jews were there in
Poland in 1918-1919?

00:24:28.568 --> 00:24:33.614
Poland was considered to be,
before Israel,

00:24:33.614 --> 00:24:39.618
Poland was really the cultural
heart of Judaism.

00:24:39.618 --> 00:24:45.000
There are three million Jews
living in Poland.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.057
In the east,
mostly Orthodox and

00:24:48.057 --> 00:24:49.440
Labavitcher.
 

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.480
By the way, just as an aside
but it's a telling aside.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.404
When I was in Zamosc we were
taken to a synagogue which had

00:24:59.404 --> 00:25:04.584
been turned into a place where
high school students and middle

00:25:04.584 --> 00:25:08.490
school students exhibited their
paintings.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:11.230
I asked the guide,
who was taking these academics

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.970
around, and press editors,
and all this stuff.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.458
I said, "Look,
what was the population of

00:25:16.458 --> 00:25:17.730
Zamosc in 1939?"
 

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.976
He said, "The population
of Zamosc in 1939 was

00:25:20.976 --> 00:25:21.950
39,000."
 

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.347
I said, "How many Jews
were living in Zamosc who had

00:25:25.347 --> 00:25:28.140
been coming to this synagogue in
1939?"

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.980
He said, "12,000."
 

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:36.185
I said, "How many Jews
live in Zamosc now?"

00:25:36.185 --> 00:25:37.499
"Zero.
 

00:25:37.499 --> 00:25:39.170
Zero."
 

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.407
The others, if they were lucky
enough not to have been killed

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:45.269
in the death camps--and I just
reviewed a book for the

00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:47.589
Globe about the ghetto in
Lodz,

00:25:47.589 --> 00:25:51.779
-they were likely to get out.
 

00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:55.277
Not to jump ahead,
but the number of Jews who

00:25:55.277 --> 00:25:59.933
survived out of three million
was about 300,000 Polish Jews

00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:02.093
who, I think,
came back to Poland after the

00:26:02.093 --> 00:26:03.269
war or who had managed somehow
to survive.

00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:06.176
The point of this is that these
ethnic tensions,

00:26:06.176 --> 00:26:09.578
particularly in a part of
Europe where anti-Semitism had

00:26:09.578 --> 00:26:10.940
been just replete.
 

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:15.858
It's a Thirty Years' War.
 

00:26:15.858 --> 00:26:18.430
How can you not leap ahead into
World War II?

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:23.020
Some of the massacres of Jews,
for example,

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:28.815
during this horrible period
were done by Ukrainians in

00:26:28.815 --> 00:26:32.970
Ukraine, Lithuanians in
Lithuania.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.150
Many of you have seen just
horrific pictures.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:35.920
I can't remember.
 

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.358
We have this awful picture that
used to be in the first

00:26:38.358 --> 00:26:41.069
edition--I don't even know if
it's in the second edition--who

00:26:41.069 --> 00:26:42.200
were beaten to death.
 

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.016
A former colleague here whom I
don't really know,

00:26:46.016 --> 00:26:48.963
Jan Gross,
wrote an important book called

00:26:48.963 --> 00:26:52.982
Neighbors about how Jews
and Poles who lived in Poland in

00:26:52.982 --> 00:26:56.556
the 1920s and 1930s lived very
peacefully in one village,

00:26:56.556 --> 00:26:58.806
and how,
without apparent instigation

00:26:58.806 --> 00:27:01.713
from the Nazis who would have
been happy to kill them all and

00:27:01.713 --> 00:27:04.218
planned to kill them all,
just simply one day started

00:27:04.218 --> 00:27:04.950
killing them all.
 

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.878
They shot them all dead,
beat them to death,

00:27:06.878 --> 00:27:08.720
put them in barns and burned
the barns.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.904
These tensions,
which are aggressive

00:27:12.904 --> 00:27:14.579
nationalism.
 

00:27:14.579 --> 00:27:16.720
I go to Poland all the time.
 

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.808
It's amazing.
 

00:27:18.808 --> 00:27:23.848
There still is this
undercurrent of anti-Semitism.

00:27:23.848 --> 00:27:26.344
I hope, since this is being
filmed, I sometimes forget,

00:27:26.344 --> 00:27:28.700
they may get letters,
but it's really incredible.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.670
I was being interviewed on
Polish TV with this other guy

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.369
and it was a pleasure to
denounce our president.

00:27:34.369 --> 00:27:37.710
Anyway, I don't speak Polish.
 

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:41.509
Another time we were all being
interviewed and they said,

00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:44.862
this guy said,
"What do you think of the

00:27:44.862 --> 00:27:46.769
Jew problem in Poland?"
 

00:27:46.769 --> 00:27:50.818
I was about to kill him.
 

00:27:50.818 --> 00:27:53.578
I shouldn't say that,
but take him out.

00:27:53.578 --> 00:27:55.470
Not really, but I was pretty
mad.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:59.048
Then this woman who was there,
who represents the Jewish

00:27:59.048 --> 00:28:02.303
community, such as it remains,
in Israel, she said,

00:28:02.303 --> 00:28:03.670
"No, no,
no.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:05.038
It's a question of
language."

00:28:05.038 --> 00:28:07.308
But when we went to one of the
Polish museums,

00:28:07.308 --> 00:28:13.384
which is the Museum of the
Warsaw Uprising--they don't have

00:28:13.384 --> 00:28:18.623
a Museum of the Ghetto
Uprising--we had to complain

00:28:18.623 --> 00:28:24.490
about how they depicted Jews in
the 1920s and 1930s.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:26.682
This is not to dump on
Polish--well,

00:28:26.682 --> 00:28:29.000
it is to dump on Polish
anti-Semitism,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.068
but not as Poland as a state.
 

00:28:31.068 --> 00:28:37.150
These tensions are exacerbated
between the wars.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.414
If you've got these frenetic
right wing leaders who are

00:28:40.414 --> 00:28:43.195
aggressive nationalists in all
of these places,

00:28:43.195 --> 00:28:44.890
who are they denouncing?
 

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.009
They're denouncing what?
 

00:28:46.009 --> 00:28:47.723
The Treaty of Versailles and
the other treaties in

00:28:47.723 --> 00:28:48.423
conjunction with it.
 

00:28:48.423 --> 00:28:48.670
Who?
 

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:51.858
Romanians, if they are
Hungarians, etc.,

00:28:51.858 --> 00:28:52.348
etc.
 

00:28:52.348 --> 00:28:55.799
You pick the nationality,
and Jews most anywhere.

00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:59.548
It was there.
 

00:28:59.548 --> 00:29:03.375
These folks are often--like
Horthy, they are preaching to

00:29:03.375 --> 00:29:04.470
the converted.
 

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.130
They're preaching to the
converted.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:11.009
It's an obvious, sad story.
 

00:29:11.009 --> 00:29:15.460
In these revisionist powers,
all this stuff is going on.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.332
I know less about and don't
have much time to talk about

00:29:19.332 --> 00:29:22.993
Bulgaria, which lost,
but you have these same kind of

00:29:22.993 --> 00:29:23.910
tensions.
 

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.748
Turkey was just
completely--that's arguably the

00:29:26.748 --> 00:29:28.970
harshest treaty,
that with Turkey.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:33.358
They lose most of what's left,
really in the Middle East,

00:29:33.358 --> 00:29:34.298
of Turkey.
 

00:29:34.298 --> 00:29:38.625
This gets transformed into
mandates under British and

00:29:38.625 --> 00:29:40.038
French control.
 

00:29:40.038 --> 00:29:46.929
As a losing power,
they lose land to their bitter

00:29:46.929 --> 00:29:49.798
archenemy, Greece.
 

00:29:49.798 --> 00:29:53.459
Then this enormous exchange of
populations begins,

00:29:53.459 --> 00:29:57.567
forced exchange of populations,
as followed by voluntary

00:29:57.567 --> 00:30:00.480
exchange between Turkey and
Greece.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.609
But the case of Turkey is
special because Attaturk,

00:30:04.609 --> 00:30:09.997
whom you can read about,
becomes the visionary president

00:30:09.997 --> 00:30:13.980
of a new Turkey,
of a secularized Turkey,

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:19.720
and does not go the way,
for all occasional stridency,

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.009
of this sort of Europe of
little dictators,

00:30:24.009 --> 00:30:29.549
the Eastern and Central Europe
of little dictators.

00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:31.970
Even as I said--where are we?
 

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.608
I kind of left my lecture
behind, but that's all right.

00:30:33.608 --> 00:30:36.380
I'm doing the themes that we
should be doing anyway.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.880
You can read about the rest.
 

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:43.800
Even in Czechoslovakia--one can
say, "There was a democracy

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.279
that really truly
functioned."

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:50.700
But there are enormous tensions
in Czechoslovakia as well.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.490
You've got your Czechs.
 

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:57.298
Your Czechs are the dominant
population in Czechoslovakia,

00:30:57.298 --> 00:31:01.940
but they are basically
Protestant, mostly Protestant.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:06.349
The Czech part or what would
become the Czech Republic is,

00:31:06.349 --> 00:31:09.135
as you already know,
largely Bohemia,

00:31:09.135 --> 00:31:11.380
or much of it is Bohemia.
 

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.150
There's Moravia also,
which is poorer,

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.490
but it is very industrial.
 

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.818
It is much more prosperous.
 

00:31:17.818 --> 00:31:24.230
Slovakia is almost entirely
Catholic and much more rural.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:27.896
It's basically a peasant
society in which the Catholic

00:31:27.896 --> 00:31:30.045
Church,
and particularly the very

00:31:30.045 --> 00:31:32.548
rightwing aspects of the
Catholic Church,

00:31:32.548 --> 00:31:34.058
as opposed to the case of
Poland,

00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:37.335
where the Catholic Church has
basically been a force for

00:31:37.335 --> 00:31:40.316
progress,
except for anti-Semitic

00:31:40.316 --> 00:31:44.058
currents in some parts of the
clergy.

00:31:44.058 --> 00:31:46.130
It's not surprising that in
World War II,

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.637
one of the most horrendous
collaborators and people

00:31:49.637 --> 00:31:53.638
cheering on the guards of the
Jews as they're packing them

00:31:53.638 --> 00:31:57.920
onto the trains to be taken away
and killed was a priest.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.980
Again, I'm not dissing the
Catholic Church.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.278
I was raised at a Jesuit high
school.

00:32:03.278 --> 00:32:10.130
But there were tensions within
Czechoslovakia also.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:14.491
Even in the triumphant case,
triumphant until the German

00:32:14.491 --> 00:32:19.490
legions start marching in and
start killing Jews again there.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:23.605
Not again, because there really
hadn't been pogroms and stuff

00:32:23.605 --> 00:32:24.838
like that there.
 

00:32:24.838 --> 00:32:32.057
Even there it's the complexity
of the whole thing that is

00:32:32.057 --> 00:32:34.250
simply amazing.
 

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:37.429
But the big point,
it's not big news,

00:32:37.429 --> 00:32:42.109
but the big point is that
ethnic contentions contested

00:32:42.109 --> 00:32:43.170
borders.
 

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:49.476
Diplomatic problems caused by
or inherent in having these new

00:32:49.476 --> 00:32:53.048
states--Czechoslovakia,
Poland,

00:32:53.048 --> 00:33:01.212
and Yugoslavia--will continue
to be very important in a place

00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:07.880
that had virtually no
parliamentary traditions.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:12.506
There were no democratic
traditions, even in a country

00:33:12.506 --> 00:33:17.481
like Poland, which had been
divided up between these three

00:33:17.481 --> 00:33:18.528
empires.
 

00:33:18.528 --> 00:33:21.226
So, it's pretty darn hard to
suddenly say,

00:33:21.226 --> 00:33:23.395
"Now we are a
republic,"

00:33:23.395 --> 00:33:25.369
and try to make that work.
 

00:33:25.369 --> 00:33:27.578
It's very, very difficult.
 

00:33:27.578 --> 00:33:30.960
Indeed, there's a mistake in
that book, or at least my Polish

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.818
friends tell me it's a mistake.
 

00:33:32.818 --> 00:33:37.776
I have described Pilsudski,
whose parents and who himself

00:33:37.776 --> 00:33:43.352
thought he was Lithuanian at the
beginning, but I already talked

00:33:43.352 --> 00:33:44.680
about that.
 

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.068
He's described as being
rightwing.

00:33:46.068 --> 00:33:48.680
He began his career as being
kind of leftwing.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.069
But he's the first to destroy
the parliamentary regime.

00:33:53.069 --> 00:33:55.269
He does that in 1926.
 

00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:59.660
Pilsudski's a great hero in
Poland, still.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:04.119
I was taken on almost a forced
march to see his tomb.

00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:09.081
Why? Because he,
in the miracle of the Vistula

00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:10.717
River,
the Vistula is this

00:34:10.717 --> 00:34:13.429
monumentally important river in
Poland,

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:17.304
that Trotsky's Red Army is
moving toward Warsaw and

00:34:17.304 --> 00:34:21.489
imagining that they're going to
move toward Berlin,

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:25.699
and assist the revolution in
Germany.

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:28.780
They're turned back in the
suburbs of Warsaw.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.829
The miracle of the Vistula by
Pilsudski.

00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:36.358
This gives him a kind of a
prestige and identification with

00:34:36.358 --> 00:34:40.030
the Polish state that is
obviously important.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.619
So, in 1926 he says,
"Look, this is

00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:45.369
impossible."
 

00:34:45.369 --> 00:34:48.092
He puts an end to the
parliamentary regime,

00:34:48.092 --> 00:34:49.518
at least in reality.
 

00:34:49.518 --> 00:34:55.661
It's in 1929 or 1930,
he arrests the progressive

00:34:55.661 --> 00:34:57.360
opposition.
 

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.099
He behaves like these other
dictators,

00:35:00.099 --> 00:35:01.949
except he's not putting people
against the wall,

00:35:01.949 --> 00:35:07.570
or having them beaten to death
by iron guards,

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:08.769
and all these groups.
 

00:35:08.769 --> 00:35:12.989
That's one of the first to go.
 

00:35:12.989 --> 00:35:17.639
Compounding all of this is
again,

00:35:17.639 --> 00:35:19.340
to go back to what I said at
the beginning,

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.889
East Central
Europe--incidentally,

00:35:22.889 --> 00:35:25.639
the Poles no longer want to see
themselves described as Eastern

00:35:25.639 --> 00:35:26.039
Europe.
 

00:35:26.039 --> 00:35:29.369
Then it was East Central Europe.
 

00:35:29.369 --> 00:35:31.597
They say, "You should go
through your book and take out

00:35:31.597 --> 00:35:33.750
all references to Eastern Europe
with regard to Poland.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.489
We are Central Europe."
 

00:35:36.489 --> 00:35:39.610
That's how they see themselves.
 

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:45.626
Again, it's impossible to
overestimate the hatred and

00:35:45.626 --> 00:35:48.750
still the fear of Russia.
 

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.931
That's why they had this
ridiculous idea of having

00:35:50.931 --> 00:35:53.380
American bases in Poland,
which is just a crazy idea.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:57.039
Anyway, that's just my personal
opinion, in parentheses.

00:35:57.039 --> 00:36:03.900
Compounding all of this is that
you've got a peasant society.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.820
All of these are peasant
societies.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.119
The vast majority of the
population are peasants.

00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:11.380
I think it's about seventy-five
percent in Poland.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.010
In Poland, Warsaw is already
very big.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:14.518
Krakow is very, very big.
 

00:36:14.518 --> 00:36:17.302
I keep talking about Poland,
because that's the one I know

00:36:17.302 --> 00:36:17.840
the best.
 

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.510
Hungary would be less because
Budapest is such a large city.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:25.639
Also, lots of the rural parts
of Hungary have been amputated.

00:36:25.639 --> 00:36:27.760
It's a peasant society.
 

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.355
What brings,
and this is the argument of my

00:36:31.355 --> 00:36:33.199
good friend,
Kim Snyder,

00:36:33.199 --> 00:36:39.918
what brings peasants into
politics in the 1920s is one

00:36:39.918 --> 00:36:42.246
thing,
besides hating the people not

00:36:42.246 --> 00:36:43.760
of the same ethnic group with
them,

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.904
depending on the place,
and maybe being anti-Semitic

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:50.536
because of the tradition of
rural money lenders and all of

00:36:50.536 --> 00:36:55.146
this who happen to be Jewish,
and Jewish storekeepers in the

00:36:55.146 --> 00:37:00.860
peasant perception of the world,
is the hope of land reform,

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.429
of land reform.
 

00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:08.443
Of maybe breaking up the big
estates, but at a minimum

00:37:08.443 --> 00:37:11.469
helping out poor rural people.
 

00:37:11.469 --> 00:37:17.251
What happens is that in the
1920s and the 1930s is that poor

00:37:17.251 --> 00:37:22.643
rural people are being screwed,
to put it a bit crudely,

00:37:22.643 --> 00:37:23.820
by what?
 

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.260
By the agricultural depression.
 

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:31.179
The price of agricultural
products, which is the economy,

00:37:31.179 --> 00:37:36.041
is the economy,
plunges to practically nothing,

00:37:36.041 --> 00:37:38.789
and they can't get by.
 

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:44.916
One of the factors for the rise
of fascism in all of its

00:37:44.916 --> 00:37:49.260
guises--it's called fascism in
Italy;

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.710
it's called National Socialism
in Germany;

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:56.875
in France, a part of the
extreme right called it

00:37:56.875 --> 00:38:00.775
francisme,
in Spain--he's not really a

00:38:00.775 --> 00:38:05.030
fascist, Franco's a rightwing
authoritarian.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:08.231
He's still a murderer,
but he's a rightwing

00:38:08.231 --> 00:38:11.282
authoritarian,
but he's still a murderer,

00:38:11.282 --> 00:38:14.179
period--is the economic
situation.

00:38:14.179 --> 00:38:17.099
I'll make this clear when I
talk about Germany.

00:38:17.099 --> 00:38:22.266
That's what drives the middle
class, which is the first class

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:23.989
to embrace Hitler.
 

00:38:23.989 --> 00:38:30.260
It's the big crisis of the
great inflation in the early

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.190
1920s.
 

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:37.079
What helps drive peasants in
all these countries,

00:38:37.079 --> 00:38:40.539
the ones who become politicized
and finally say,

00:38:40.539 --> 00:38:44.710
"What did parliamentary
regime bring me and my family?

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:45.570
Not much.
 

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.349
We still can't get by."
 

00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:49.980
So, there we go.
 

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.237
"These little dictator
guys thundering away,

00:38:53.237 --> 00:38:56.360
they seem to be telling it like
it is."

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.686
It's the Jews,
or it's the Bulgarians,

00:38:58.686 --> 00:39:01.516
or it's the Romanians,
or it's the Hungarians,

00:39:01.516 --> 00:39:04.219
or it's the Serbs,
or it's the Muslims.

00:39:04.219 --> 00:39:06.099
It's the Greeks.
 

00:39:06.099 --> 00:39:06.940
It's the Turks.
 

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.889
You name it.
 

00:39:07.889 --> 00:39:11.030
You fill in the national group.
 

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.159
It's a Europe of hatred.
 

00:39:13.159 --> 00:39:17.650
It's a Europe of fear,
an absorbed,

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:20.030
integrated fear.
 

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:23.440
I suppose that's kind of a
silly way of putting it,

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.420
but not that bad after all.
 

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:29.018
When they look around,
what do they see?

00:39:29.018 --> 00:39:33.889
First, these countries are
frightened.

00:39:33.889 --> 00:39:37.829
These powers,
the new states ally.

00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:40.144
They say, "We're going to
have to lie together,"

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:41.768
and some of them join up with
France,

00:39:41.768 --> 00:39:44.489
and that won't do them much
good in 1939.

00:39:44.489 --> 00:39:48.750
But there is this model that
seems to be working in Germany.

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:52.565
The French, what they do in
this inflation in the 1920s and

00:39:52.565 --> 00:39:55.920
1930s, they were loaning money
everywhere before.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.889
They pulled in the reins.
 

00:39:57.889 --> 00:39:59.300
They bring in the credit.
 

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.972
Nazi Germany,
particularly after it is Nazi

00:40:02.972 --> 00:40:07.605
Germany, after January 1933,
they provide this sort of

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:08.480
model.
 

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.050
They say, "We'll help you
out.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:11.590
We'll help you out.
 

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:14.710
The other countries are not
buying your products.

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:16.079
We'll buy even more of them.
 

00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:17.630
We'll loan you money.
 

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.170
We'll organize this."
 

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:22.559
It seems to be an orderly
society.

00:40:22.559 --> 00:40:23.960
More about that.
 

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:28.000
It's not just a society of
coercion, without jumping ahead.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.865
Hitler seems to be providing
things to the German people that

00:40:32.865 --> 00:40:33.840
they want.
 

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:38.510
Work, the armaments factories
are preparing for war.

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:41.369
Order, they're arresting petty
criminals.

00:40:41.369 --> 00:40:42.639
I'll talk more about that.
 

00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:45.360
And racial purity.
 

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.030
They begin thinking,
"Hey, that's a good thing.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.039
It's the fault of the Jews and
the Poles.

00:40:51.039 --> 00:40:52.719
It's the fault of the
Poles."

00:40:52.719 --> 00:40:58.420
When they invade Poland,
I don't emphasize this as much

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:04.224
as I should have in your book,
but they begin right away

00:41:04.224 --> 00:41:06.969
carrying out genocide.
 

00:41:06.969 --> 00:41:12.081
They begin killing the Polish
intelligentsia right away,

00:41:12.081 --> 00:41:16.449
and they kill the Polish
generals right away.

00:41:16.449 --> 00:41:20.365
The Russians are doing the same
thing, actually,

00:41:20.365 --> 00:41:22.449
the Soviets further on.
 

00:41:22.449 --> 00:41:29.438
It's a permanent source of
instability, this agrarian

00:41:29.438 --> 00:41:34.679
depression, this economic
depression.

00:41:34.679 --> 00:41:37.699
What it does,
it's a factor for further

00:41:37.699 --> 00:41:39.130
destabilization.
 

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:43.759
Talk about parliamentary
regimes comes pretty cheap,

00:41:43.759 --> 00:41:47.300
but they disappear one after
another.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:52.619
And in each and every case,
with the fascists and variants,

00:41:52.619 --> 00:41:57.300
in each and every case the
discourse is,

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:01.070
"We, the real people of
this place,

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:05.530
do not want these other people
here.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:06.949
We don't want them here."
 

00:42:06.949 --> 00:42:15.224
Of course, not all of these
people carried it to the outcome

00:42:15.224 --> 00:42:19.409
of the Nazis,
or of the Lithuanians and the

00:42:19.409 --> 00:42:23.291
Ukrainians who just started
beating Jews to death along the

00:42:23.291 --> 00:42:23.760
way.
 

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:29.213
But it wasn't just the Western
states that had great

00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:30.710
instability.
 

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:35.527
The willingness,
indeed the eagerness of people

00:42:35.527 --> 00:42:38.900
like Horthy to collaborate with
Hitler openly,

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:43.041
enthusiastically,
all the way through until the

00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:45.369
bitter end is,
in part,

00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:50.081
a result of--these rightwing
movements become mass movements

00:42:50.081 --> 00:42:54.079
in these places,
as they did in Germany.

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:57.661
And as they did in eight
percent of the population of the

00:42:57.661 --> 00:43:00.539
Netherlands votes for a guy
called Musser,

00:43:00.539 --> 00:43:04.780
who's their little fascist guy,
or in Belgium,

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.619
which is a town of shopkeepers.
 

00:43:06.619 --> 00:43:11.099
They support their guy who just
died about ten years ago,

00:43:11.099 --> 00:43:14.300
Degrelle, who died on the Costa
Brava.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.768
They all seem to die on the
Costa Brava.

00:43:16.768 --> 00:43:18.795
They all basically get away
with it and end up going to

00:43:18.795 --> 00:43:20.969
Spain, and a lot of them
protected by the Franco regime.

00:43:20.969 --> 00:43:23.219
They all seem to croak on the
Costa Brava.

00:43:23.219 --> 00:43:28.289
Anyway, I got away from the
text but it doesn't matter.

00:43:28.289 --> 00:43:31.400
I think I made my points anyway.
 

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:38.059
The points are that Europe is
in a period of instability.

00:43:38.059 --> 00:43:42.844
That with the exception of the
big powers in the West between

00:43:42.844 --> 00:43:45.797
1924 and 1929,
all these places are in

00:43:45.797 --> 00:43:50.240
depression and that the sweeping
away of parliamentary regimes in

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.338
places that had virtually no
parliamentary traditions at all

00:43:54.338 --> 00:43:56.630
was not all that surprising.
 

00:43:56.630 --> 00:44:00.920
It was compounded by the
outcome of World War I.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.978
Again, as I said before at
least twice, the demons of the

00:44:04.978 --> 00:44:07.949
twentieth century emerged from
the war.

00:44:07.949 --> 00:44:11.210
Nowhere more tellingly,
more appallingly,

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:15.579
with greater costs,
with greater devastation,

00:44:15.579 --> 00:44:18.519
with humanity sinking to an
all-time low,

00:44:18.519 --> 00:44:22.510
than that in Nazi Germany.
 

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:24.929
That's what I'm going to talk
about next Wednesday.

00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:28.440
Monday, another cheerful
topic--Stalinism.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.159
We will go from there.
 

00:44:31.159 --> 00:44:32.210
Have a wonderful weekend.
 

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:33.210
I'll see you.

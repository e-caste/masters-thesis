PAUL FREEDMAN: It does
seem as if

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.233
we are back to invasions
again.

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:10.933
We end the course the way we
began it, except they're

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.267
different invaders.

00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:16.267
One thing that I'm sure
Professor Frank will want you

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:18.600
to get out of the
Vikings course--

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.800
and not all of you are going to
take that, obviously, so I

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.600
will mention this-- is they did
not have horned helmets.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.500
The horned helmet idea--

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.933
actually, Roberta Frank has
researched where this totally

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:38.267
inaccurate idea comes from and
why it is ineradicable.

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:42.367
But if there's one thing you
should come out of the second

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:46.433
part of this course
knowing, it's that.

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:49.600
So we're discussing people from
Scandinavia, different

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.267
parts of Scandinavia, who had
different destinations.

00:00:53.267 --> 00:00:55.367
So different parts
of Scandinavia:

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:57.800
Denmark, Norway, Sweden.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.133
Different destinations: the
Frankish Empire of Charlemagne

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:06.000
for which they bear some
responsibility for unraveling,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.533
Russia, the British
Isles, Iceland,

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.233
Greenland, the New World.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.467
They certainly got around.

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:19.933
They're not always the
same populations.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.500
And they have different
ambitions in different places.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.633
Basically, those ambitions can
be divided into raiding,

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:31.967
trading, and settling.

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:34.900
These are not mutually
exclusive.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.133
Although usually they began by
raiding almost always if they

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.800
were dealing with a place
that had people.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.733
Thus obviously Iceland
when they came didn't

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.367
have people at all.

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:52.567
So they came there as explorers
or settlers.

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:57.333
The crucial changeover is in
their attacks on the British

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.500
Isles and on the Frankish
Empire.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.300
They begin as raiders, that is
as seaborne warriors who would

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.167
plunder opportunistic
targets--

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:12.867
monasteries, for example--

00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:19.267
and then leave with
their spoils.

00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:22.500
They also, however,
were traders.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.867
And I don't want to make too
much of this as if it were a

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:29.633
timeless statement, but in the
period we're dealing with,

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:34.633
raiding and trading weren't
all that far apart.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:39.233
When the Vikings in the east,
mostly from Sweden, were

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:47.300
dealing with the Caliphate in
Baghdad or the Byzantine

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.300
Empire, they found these targets
too well organized

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.900
with too overpowering a
military presence to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.933
intimidate in the way that
they were able to do with

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:01.700
Britain and the Frankish
Empire.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.300
So here they were
more traders.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.333
They brought various products,
particularly slaves and fur,

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:13.867
to the Caliphate and to
the Byzantine Empire.

00:03:13.867 --> 00:03:19.133
And they came back with a lot of
coins, among other things.

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:22.700
80,000 coins from the Caliphate
have been found in

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.433
Sweden alone.

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.100
So here they're traders.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.367
Settlers.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.400
They would eventually settle in
the Frankish Empire and in

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.400
the Anglo-Saxon kingdom
of England.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.100
They would settle in Ireland.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.333
Indeed, the city of Dublin was
founded by the Vikings.

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:48.300
They would settle in
Iceland completely.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.300
That is, the people who live
in Iceland now are the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.500
descendants of mostly Norwegian,
some Danish

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.667
settlers of the tenth and
eleventh centuries.

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:06.567
They would even try to settle as
far afield as Newfoundland.

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:10.667
There is a place in Newfoundland
that it is

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.000
unmistakably, by the
archaeological evidence, a

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.233
Viking site.

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:19.667
This doesn't ultimately work.

00:04:19.667 --> 00:04:26.133
So it is wrong to think of them
exclusively as savage

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:30.500
warriors, as barbarians, but
then again, we've seen that

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.167
it's wrong to think of most of
the invading peoples of the

00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:37.267
period we've been discussing
as just

00:04:37.267 --> 00:04:39.300
totally savage raiders.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.833
These are extremely skilled
raiders, and as I've just

00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:46.767
gotten through saying, they're
raiders with several different

00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:48.333
possible agendas.

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:49.867
They're very adaptive.

00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:54.233
The question remains, what made
Scandinavia so powerful

00:04:54.233 --> 00:04:57.333
in the ninth and tenth
centuries, especially since

00:04:57.333 --> 00:05:03.800
Scandinavia tends not
to be a major

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.633
actor in European politics.

00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:09.500
The two periods in which
it is are this one--

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.000
basically the ninth, tenth,
eleventh centuries--

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.100
and the seventeenth century
when the armies of Sweden

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.500
under Gustavus Adolphus
terrorized Central Europe.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.300
That effort was ultimately ended
not in Central Europe

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.133
but in Eastern Europe
by Russia.

00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:31.167
And the Russians defeated the
Swedes sufficiently in the

00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:34.000
early eighteenth so that they
basically never got themselves

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.600
very heavily involved in
European politics again.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.000
Part of the answer of
"Why Scandinavia?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.233
Why now?" is that we're dealing
with another savage or

00:05:48.233 --> 00:05:52.033
certainly less civilized
population who erupt from

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:55.167
their homeland and devastate
a weak but

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:57.867
relatively rich society.

00:05:57.867 --> 00:06:02.400
There's nothing very
unusual about that.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.933
We have seen it with the Roman
Empire, and you can see it

00:06:07.933 --> 00:06:11.667
later with such successful
campaigns as those of the

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:15.400
Mongols in the thirteenth
century.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.267
So the other reason besides
opportunity is tactics.

00:06:22.267 --> 00:06:25.433
The Vikings were masters
of the sea.

00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:29.400
If you ever do go to Denmark,
Sweden, or Norway, you must go

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.167
to the Viking museums there.

00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:32.933
They are absolutely
enthralling.

00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:37.667
And you see these ships that
seem unbelievably flimsy for

00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:40.000
the voyages that
they undertook.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
On the other hand, by reason
of their small size and

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.267
particularly shallow draft--

00:06:46.267 --> 00:06:50.300
that is to say they're able to
be stable without being so

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.767
deep underneath the ship, having
a keel underneath--

00:06:54.767 --> 00:06:57.067
that they can sail up rivers.

00:06:57.067 --> 00:07:02.700
They can both, therefore, go in
the Atlantic and be stable

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.133
enough to make the journey and
go up rivers that are no more

00:07:06.133 --> 00:07:10.333
than five or six feet deep at
points like the Seine in

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:12.433
France or the Loire in France.

00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:16.600
And so they could raid far
inland with these ships.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.833
And as masters of seas and
rivers, they could easily

00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:27.400
outrun the clumsy, slow
Carolingian armies.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:33.233
They could raid a monastery,
check out another monastery

00:07:33.233 --> 00:07:35.000
the same afternoon.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.200
"Oh, there's an army there.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.567
Well, we'll just get back
in the ship, and

00:07:37.567 --> 00:07:38.600
we'll go further down.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.833
And then we'll look for more
tempting targets--

00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:46.433
palaces, towns, monasteries."

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:48.767
They were not good
at fortification.

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:52.033
If a place was fortified, they
tended to pass it by.

00:07:52.033 --> 00:07:55.300
They were not siege masters.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:01.033
Their control, therefore, of the
water is not dissimilar to

00:08:01.033 --> 00:08:05.033
the Arabs' advantage in the
beginning of the Arab

00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:07.833
expansion that we talked about
with regard to the desert.

00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:09.667
The desert functions
the same way.

00:08:09.667 --> 00:08:13.467
An environment that these people
controlled in the sense

00:08:13.467 --> 00:08:18.333
that they could maneuver easily
in it, and their more

00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:22.733
civilized opponent with larger
armies could not.

00:08:22.733 --> 00:08:27.600
The Persian and the Byzantine
armies couldn't really go very

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.900
far into the desert.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.867
They had supply line, water
problems. They actually didn't

00:08:32.867 --> 00:08:33.900
know the desert.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.300
It all looked the
same to them.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.767
So this is the same or at least
a similar advantage for

00:08:40.767 --> 00:08:43.467
the Vikings.

00:08:43.467 --> 00:08:48.167
The Vikings are different from
other raiders partly in their

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:51.700
ability to construct
governments, not only to

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:58.100
settle lands, but to create
governments ranging from the

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.767
what advertises itself with some
accuracy as the world's

00:09:01.767 --> 00:09:06.933
oldest democracy, Iceland,
where tourists are still

00:09:06.933 --> 00:09:13.400
pointed out the place where the
kind of parliament of all

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.367
citizens took place as early as
2,000 [correction: 1,000]

00:09:17.367 --> 00:09:18.800
years ago.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.100
And they're also the founders of
Russia, probably not to be

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.800
advertised as the world's
oldest democracy.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.967
Certainly not a country that's
had a whole lot of experience

00:09:28.967 --> 00:09:30.733
with that particular
form of government.

00:09:30.733 --> 00:09:35.900
But in fact, the first Christian
rulers of Russia,

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:41.000
the same Vladimir and his
successors, who were baptized

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.267
and crowned under Byzantine
auspices were Scandinavian.

00:09:47.267 --> 00:09:50.267
And the Scandinavian groups
are called the Rus.

00:09:50.267 --> 00:09:54.767
They quickly lose their
Scandinavian language and

00:09:54.767 --> 00:09:58.000
identity, but nevertheless that
is the founding dynasty

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.300
of the first Russian rulers.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.333
So the Vikings have a
fascinating culture and

00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:11.600
literature, amazing sagas mostly
preserved through their

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:17.033
Icelandic versions, very
interesting art, very

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.233
interesting forms of decoration,
and then these

00:10:20.233 --> 00:10:23.500
magnificent ships.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.933
Their major contribution to the
history of Europe may be

00:10:26.933 --> 00:10:31.567
geopolitical in the sense that
they connect parts of the

00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:34.900
world that were otherwise
minimally

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.067
or not at all connected.

00:10:37.067 --> 00:10:43.333
So from Central Asia to
Greenland, they build various

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:45.200
kinds of cultural and

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.767
particularly commercial
networks.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.567
They also contribute to the
destroying of the Carolingian

00:10:53.567 --> 00:10:55.133
Empire, the destroying
of what we were

00:10:55.133 --> 00:10:57.433
discussing before the vacation.

00:10:57.433 --> 00:10:59.100
They're not the sole cause.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.233
We talked about weaknesses
within the Carolingian Empire,

00:11:02.233 --> 00:11:04.800
but certainly the Viking
invasions have devastated it

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.867
during the ninth century
did not at all help.

00:11:08.867 --> 00:11:13.167
Where did this drive for
expansion come from besides

00:11:13.167 --> 00:11:14.500
opportunity?

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.867
And there's not a tremendous
agreement on

00:11:16.867 --> 00:11:19.500
this point among scholars.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:24.400
Overpopulation and land
hunger are possible.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.600
To this day, these are not
densely populated countries.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:35.100
And in the pre-modern period,
they could not support

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.467
anything but a very small
population given the fact that

00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:42.233
most of the land is not capable
of being cultivated.

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:44.000
So you can get to a point of

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
over-population pretty quickly.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.100
Opportunities afforded by
the weakness of others--

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.267
I've mentioned this.

00:11:53.267 --> 00:11:58.100
Internal feuding and the
creation of exiles.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.800
It's hard to separate legend
from history, but the legends

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.733
about the founding of Iceland
and Greenland in particular

00:12:03.733 --> 00:12:08.433
involve people who were too
rowdy for the Vikings.

00:12:08.433 --> 00:12:11.700
I pause on that, because it's a
little hard to imagine what

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.000
such a person would
have been like.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.267
Nevertheless, these sagas tell
us that various people were

00:12:18.267 --> 00:12:24.900
just too mean for quiet,
civilized old Norway or even

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.267
couldn't get their energies
fulfilled by plundering the

00:12:29.267 --> 00:12:31.900
Frankish Empire and went
off to Iceland

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.167
and places like that.

00:12:36.167 --> 00:12:39.033
The climate conditions may
have been favorable.

00:12:39.033 --> 00:12:41.700
It may have been relatively
warm.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.233
There's a lot of debate about
the settlement of Greenland in

00:12:45.233 --> 00:12:47.667
this regard in particular.

00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:51.333
We know that by the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries,

00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:56.600
Greenland was becoming too cold
for the Scandinavians and

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.167
not for the Inuit, who were
better adapted to real polar

00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:04.000
conditions.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.167
But this is something that is
of crucial importance in

00:13:10.167 --> 00:13:14.433
tracing the history of climate
and is hotly debated.

00:13:14.433 --> 00:13:16.967
But it certainly looks as
if it gets colder in the

00:13:16.967 --> 00:13:18.433
thirteenth, fourteenth
century--

00:13:18.433 --> 00:13:20.333
fourteenth century
particularly--

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:25.467
throughout Europe and the
Atlantic and probably warmer

00:13:25.467 --> 00:13:28.033
in the tenth and eleventh
centuries when this expansion

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:29.867
is taking place.

00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:33.467
And then finally, there's a cult
of personal valor that is

00:13:33.467 --> 00:13:37.300
even stronger than that of
early medieval Europe.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:44.300
A male cult of violent military
bravery and the

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.633
opportunity to demonstrate
that was a kind

00:13:47.633 --> 00:13:49.067
of competitive sport.

00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:55.500
The Viking raids in England
and the Continent

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.767
begin around 800.

00:13:57.767 --> 00:14:03.267
One of the first stunning events
is the sack of the

00:14:03.267 --> 00:14:07.967
island monastery of Lindisfarne
on the eastern

00:14:07.967 --> 00:14:11.300
coast of northern England.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.500
The monastery of Lindisfarne
was sacked by

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.567
the Vikings in 797.

00:14:18.567 --> 00:14:25.700
Charlemagne was able to repulse
these raids and the

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.300
English as well.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.700
But the civil wars that we were
talking about among the

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:41.533
sons of Louis the Pious started
to encourage the

00:14:41.533 --> 00:14:44.200
Vikings indirectly by the
disunity of the Frankish

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.067
Empire, the wasting of military
resources on what

00:14:47.067 --> 00:14:50.400
was, in effect, a kind
of civil war.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.600
But also the Vikings just got
stronger and more ambitious,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.267
because their raids on
relatively well organized

00:14:57.267 --> 00:15:04.800
Britain start to reach their
height in the 830s.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.533
So you start having the
abandonment of monasteries,

00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:12.533
for example, the abandonment of
Lindisfarne and the moving

00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:13.833
of its relics.

00:15:13.833 --> 00:15:16.700
So the relics of Saint
Cuthbert of York

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.767
move around a lot.

00:15:18.767 --> 00:15:23.533
Monks on the western coast
of France abandon their

00:15:23.533 --> 00:15:27.467
monasteries and move their
communities and

00:15:27.467 --> 00:15:28.733
relics further inland.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:37.433
The Vikings seem to jockey
between emphasizing raids on

00:15:37.433 --> 00:15:41.467
the Frankish Empire and on
England, but basically they're

00:15:41.467 --> 00:15:42.900
doing both.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.967
They start to spend the
winter, what's called

00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:49.567
over-wintering in the late
830s, early 840s.

00:15:49.567 --> 00:15:52.233
And that's a sinister sign from
the point of view of the

00:15:52.233 --> 00:15:55.800
English, Irish, and Franks,
because that means that

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.933
they're going from raiding
to some form of settling.

00:15:59.933 --> 00:16:04.133
If they can spend the winter
and not just the classic

00:16:04.133 --> 00:16:09.367
raiding season, why not
just stay permanently?

00:16:09.367 --> 00:16:13.833
So they start coming
up the rivers.

00:16:13.833 --> 00:16:18.000
They start plundering
cities that are not

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.400
sufficiently fortified.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.800
A monk in the 860s writes, "the
number of ships grows

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:31.367
every year..." The feeling of
just this complete takeover.

00:16:31.367 --> 00:16:33.100
Now, that's the monastic
point of view.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.967
The monasteries were ideal
targets, because they are

00:16:35.967 --> 00:16:42.100
rich, isolated, and minimally
fortified.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.567
But nevertheless, the
Carolingians have no fleet to

00:16:46.567 --> 00:16:47.933
match the Viking ships.

00:16:47.933 --> 00:16:49.833
The way to stop the Vikings--

00:16:49.833 --> 00:16:54.300
and it was only really
implemented in

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.833
the 870s and 880s.

00:16:55.833 --> 00:16:58.833
The way to stop the Vikings was
with fortified bridges.

00:16:58.833 --> 00:17:02.267
If you built a bridge that the
Vikings could not go past

00:17:02.267 --> 00:17:05.867
without fighting and fortified
it sufficiently and had

00:17:05.867 --> 00:17:09.733
sufficient numbers of troops,
you would stymie them.

00:17:09.733 --> 00:17:13.100
And this is eventually
what happens.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.800
In the late ninth century, the
Vikings are defeated at the

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:24.300
gates of Paris in 888--

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.300
885, 886, rather.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.667
And they start accommodating
with the European rulers.

00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:38.667
That is to say they are given
lands to settle and then made

00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:40.133
to promise to stop raiding.

00:17:40.133 --> 00:17:43.400
And in effect, they start to
settle down towards the end of

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.367
the ninth century, beginning of
the tenth century so that,

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:53.267
for example, a treaty in 911
with the West Frankish ruler,

00:17:53.267 --> 00:17:57.167
the ruler we can start to call
the King of France, allows

00:17:57.167 --> 00:18:02.133
them to settle in northwestern
France in a territory that

00:18:02.133 --> 00:18:03.767
henceforth was called
Normandy.

00:18:06.733 --> 00:18:08.400
Same in French.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.267
Normandie.

00:18:09.267 --> 00:18:13.333
The territory of the "Northmen"
is what they're

00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:17.767
usually referred to in the
sources rather than "Vikings."

00:18:17.767 --> 00:18:19.533
The territory of the Northmen.

00:18:19.533 --> 00:18:26.767
So Normandy in 911 was a
province settled by Vikings

00:18:26.767 --> 00:18:31.167
nominally loyal to the
King of France.

00:18:31.167 --> 00:18:36.567
The Vikings very quickly
lose their language.

00:18:36.567 --> 00:18:39.267
By the time of the Duke of
Normandy, William the

00:18:39.267 --> 00:18:47.533
Conqueror 150 or so years
later, they are Norman.

00:18:47.533 --> 00:18:49.767
They speak French.

00:18:49.767 --> 00:18:52.100
They are more French
than anything else,

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.033
although a bit different.

00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:57.667
Their ships still look a
bit like Viking ships.

00:18:57.667 --> 00:19:01.033
If you know the Bayeux Tapestry,
which is this

00:19:01.033 --> 00:19:05.200
embroidery that shows the
history of the Norman conquest

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.367
of England, their ships look
very much like our image of

00:19:09.367 --> 00:19:11.433
Viking ships.

00:19:11.433 --> 00:19:17.433
In England, the 860s are the
zenith of their destruction.

00:19:17.433 --> 00:19:23.367
They actually in effect
partition England between an

00:19:23.367 --> 00:19:25.000
eastern and a western part.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.567
The eastern part becomes a
territory called the Dane law,

00:19:30.567 --> 00:19:32.933
the place where the Danes
have settled.

00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:39.533
And their indirect effect on
England is to force the

00:19:39.533 --> 00:19:42.933
Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to unify.

00:19:42.933 --> 00:19:46.433
So rather than the multiple
kingdoms that we looked at at

00:19:46.433 --> 00:19:48.333
Bede's time--

00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:51.133
Mercia, East Anglia,
Northumbria--

00:19:51.133 --> 00:19:56.733
we have the western kingdom
formerly called Wessex, which

00:19:56.733 --> 00:20:06.100
under King Alfred in the 860s
to 880s becomes really the

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.700
sole Anglo-Saxon kingdom of
England and gradually defeats

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.867
the Vikings, eventually kicking
them out of the

00:20:14.867 --> 00:20:19.867
British Isles altogether
by about 930 or so.

00:20:19.867 --> 00:20:25.567
So the conquests in the Frankish
and English realms

00:20:25.567 --> 00:20:31.467
are not permanent in the sense
that there's minimal

00:20:31.467 --> 00:20:34.233
Scandinavian impact
of a permanent

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.933
sort on these places.

00:20:36.933 --> 00:20:41.500
There are not a lot of people
speaking Old Norse in either

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.000
place in 1100.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.933
But their impact is tremendous
in terms of organizing these

00:20:46.933 --> 00:20:53.033
places, creating networks,
founding cities like Dublin,

00:20:53.033 --> 00:20:57.400
reorganizing kingdoms like
Ireland, creating Normandy,

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:02.733
and really kind of throwing the
puzzle on the floor and

00:21:02.733 --> 00:21:05.667
reforming it.

00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:07.433
In the East and in
the Atlantic.

00:21:10.067 --> 00:21:14.600
Here you have to imagine or sort
of visualize Scandinavia

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.567
sitting on the top of Europe.

00:21:17.567 --> 00:21:24.100
The same effect that encourages
airlines to use

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.700
polar routes as a shorter way to
cross the globe also allows

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.333
the Scandinavians in effect
to choose their targets.

00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:34.000
Some of this is logical.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.800
Norway is much easier, much
closer to the British Isles

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.767
than you might think.

00:21:39.767 --> 00:21:42.800
It sort of sits on
top of them.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:49.600
And Sweden is much closer to
the East via the North than

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.167
one would think.

00:21:50.167 --> 00:21:53.800
But even Norway, for example,
the modern kingdom of Norway,

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.400
has a border with Russia.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.867
It goes so far north, and then
it has this very little,

00:22:01.867 --> 00:22:06.900
narrow piece of land that is
only about thirty miles from

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.000
the important Russian
port of Murmansk.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.900
And all of these places are
relatively warm given how far

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.833
north they are because
of the Gulf Stream.

00:22:17.833 --> 00:22:26.267
So just as London is
surprisingly warm considering

00:22:26.267 --> 00:22:31.300
that it's on the same latitude
as Newfoundland, so these

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:36.000
northern parts of Scandinavia
are the equivalent of polar

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.567
wastes of northern Canada.

00:22:38.567 --> 00:22:42.033
And yet they are--

00:22:42.033 --> 00:22:43.500
they're cold enough.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.233
The problem with them is
they're really dark.

00:22:46.233 --> 00:22:47.867
So they're dark for months
at a time, but they're

00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:49.733
not all that cold.

00:22:49.733 --> 00:22:55.233
From this vantage point then,
the East would be a tempting

00:22:55.233 --> 00:22:59.733
source of enterprise for
Vikings, particularly but not

00:22:59.733 --> 00:23:02.900
exclusively from Scandinavia,
especially

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.667
in the tenth century.

00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:09.367
They would go via the Baltic
Sea and the Gulf of Finland

00:23:09.367 --> 00:23:13.233
down the Russian rivers
like the Dnieper--

00:23:13.233 --> 00:23:15.400
Dnieper with a D--

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:25.533
to the Black Sea and the Volga
to the Caspian Sea.

00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:34.333
They used to these rivers as
ways of reaching territories

00:23:34.333 --> 00:23:40.600
of Byzantine and of Caliphal
influence.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:46.100
They traded, raided
when possible.

00:23:49.567 --> 00:23:53.300
A lot of our descriptions of the
Vikings by outsiders, our

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:58.000
most accurate descriptions, are
from Muslim travelers who

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.333
describe who these people are,
what their products are even

00:24:02.333 --> 00:24:06.000
though very little remains
in this region to

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.600
attest to the Vikings.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.900
The main evidence, as we said,
are really coins taken back to

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.733
Scandinavia.

00:24:13.733 --> 00:24:15.733
Their base--

00:24:15.733 --> 00:24:18.833
that is the Viking base
in this eastern area--

00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:22.733
was what would become Kiev
in modern Ukraine.

00:24:22.733 --> 00:24:27.367
And Kiev would be the first
Russian Scandinavian kingdom

00:24:27.367 --> 00:24:30.300
ruled by a tsar.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:35.600
They had ambitions to take over
Constantinople, a city

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.733
they called in sort of
Tolkien-esque fashion

00:24:39.733 --> 00:24:40.967
"Mickelgard"--

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.333
"Gard" meaning city, "mickel"
meaning powerful.

00:24:48.333 --> 00:24:50.633
"Mickel" still in Middle
English, in Chaucer's English,

00:24:50.633 --> 00:24:58.700
means "impressive,"
"powerful."

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.067
Their attacks on Mickelgard
didn't work.

00:25:01.067 --> 00:25:04.333
They attacked in 860 and 941,
and we've seen that

00:25:04.333 --> 00:25:08.033
Constantinople was able to
fight off more impressive

00:25:08.033 --> 00:25:09.800
enemies than this.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.533
They therefore were dealing with
wealthy and established

00:25:13.533 --> 00:25:17.400
states, well-organized states,
better organized than the

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.133
Carolingian Empire or the
Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, and so

00:25:20.133 --> 00:25:25.833
states that were capable
of defeating them.

00:25:25.833 --> 00:25:32.767
They therefore came to these
areas controlled by Baghdad

00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:38.900
and Constantinople more as
traders than as raiders.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.967
What did they bring
to trade with?

00:25:41.967 --> 00:25:46.200
They have certain classic
products, things from the

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:57.100
North Sea, like walrus ivory,
very highly prized, amber from

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.300
the Baltic Sea--

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:06.767
amber used in jewelry and
medicine, a stone that's not

00:26:06.767 --> 00:26:09.833
really a stone, a thing that's
much lighter than it looks

00:26:09.833 --> 00:26:13.867
like credited with various
kinds of mysterious or at

00:26:13.867 --> 00:26:19.100
least medicinal properties
throughout the formerly Roman

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.067
and Islamic world.

00:26:21.067 --> 00:26:22.433
Arrows and swords.

00:26:22.433 --> 00:26:24.900
The West was very good
at metalworking.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.433
Honey, hunting falcons, wax.

00:26:29.433 --> 00:26:32.867
But as I said, their two
great commodities

00:26:32.867 --> 00:26:37.033
were slaves and furs.

00:26:37.033 --> 00:26:37.933
Slaves--

00:26:37.933 --> 00:26:41.033
these societies of the Byzantine
Empire and the

00:26:41.033 --> 00:26:44.100
Caliphate always wanted
more slaves.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.067
They had plenty of unpleasant
labor as well as domestic

00:26:49.067 --> 00:26:50.733
service shortages.

00:26:50.733 --> 00:26:57.400
And so many of these slaves
were Slavs, that is Slavic

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:02.133
populations rounded up by the
Vikings and then sold in

00:27:02.133 --> 00:27:04.533
Constantinople or Baghdad.

00:27:04.533 --> 00:27:06.300
Furs.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.167
On the one hand, furs like
sable, marten, mink that

00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:16.333
bounded in the eastern Baltic
regions and in what's now

00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:20.900
northern Russia were
tremendously prized in a world

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.567
in which central heating
was nonexistent.

00:27:23.567 --> 00:27:26.833
And although we may not think
of modern Istanbul as

00:27:26.833 --> 00:27:30.300
particularly cold, it's
quite cold and damp.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:35.100
One can certainly understand the
practical desire for furs

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.433
for well-off people in
the Byzantine Empire.

00:27:37.433 --> 00:27:39.533
In the Caliphate, it may
seem a little stranger.

00:27:39.533 --> 00:27:44.333
Baghdad is more noted for
unbearable heat than cold.

00:27:44.333 --> 00:27:47.867
On the other hand, the Caliphate
includes territories

00:27:47.867 --> 00:27:52.933
like Afghanistan,
eastern Iran.

00:27:52.933 --> 00:27:57.433
And also, keep in mind, as is
the case with Palm Beach and

00:27:57.433 --> 00:28:03.533
Miami Beach even as we speak now
in late November, that for

00:28:03.533 --> 00:28:08.800
certain people, the prestige
of the furs transcends any

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.600
need for practical warmth.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.867
So these are the two
great products.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.200
So they're plunderers and
extortionists, but they're

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.700
fairly creative plunderers
and extortionists.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:33.867
They create a number of trading
cities, not only Kiev

00:28:33.867 --> 00:28:41.167
further south, but the great
city of Novgorod sort of

00:28:41.167 --> 00:28:47.200
between the Baltic and the more
modern city of Moscow.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.067
These cities are fortified,
leading one to assume that

00:28:51.067 --> 00:28:56.333
they weren't just free-trade
zones, that other people

00:28:56.333 --> 00:28:59.167
raided them or that the Vikings
expected other people

00:28:59.167 --> 00:29:01.967
to try to revenge themselves
on their kind

00:29:01.967 --> 00:29:05.567
of raiding and trading.

00:29:05.567 --> 00:29:09.467
So anyway, as we've said before,
trading and plundering

00:29:09.467 --> 00:29:12.167
are not necessarily
totally distinct.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:28.933
So finally, the West. The
Vikings begin to explore the

00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:36.567
Atlantic mostly from Norway
and beginning after the

00:29:36.567 --> 00:29:39.533
maximum period of raiding
of England starts to

00:29:39.533 --> 00:29:44.000
tail off in the 860s.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.467
These lands were uninhabited,
Iceland, or minimally

00:29:48.467 --> 00:29:50.733
inhabited, Greenland.

00:29:54.033 --> 00:29:58.167
They were very attractive for
hunting and for pasturing.

00:29:58.167 --> 00:30:03.700
Where the Vikings found a fair
density of people, they tended

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.933
not to stay.

00:30:04.933 --> 00:30:07.167
This is their problem
with Newfoundland.

00:30:07.167 --> 00:30:11.033
They have a settlement in
Newfoundland at a place whose

00:30:11.033 --> 00:30:17.367
modern name is somewhat
confusing way called L'Anse

00:30:17.367 --> 00:30:18.600
aux Meadows.

00:30:20.733 --> 00:30:24.333
So you have a French and
English compound.

00:30:24.333 --> 00:30:28.067
L'Anse aux Meadows in
Newfoundland, one of a number

00:30:28.067 --> 00:30:32.133
of certainly the most best-known
Viking sites.

00:30:32.133 --> 00:30:40.233
But there were Native Americans
who drove them out,

00:30:40.233 --> 00:30:47.167
not necessarily because they
were superior in armament, but

00:30:47.167 --> 00:30:50.333
it just wasn't really worth
it to the Vikings to stay.

00:30:50.333 --> 00:30:51.967
So their staying
in Newfoundland

00:30:51.967 --> 00:30:53.367
is relatively brief.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:01.433
In order to go from Norway to
Iceland, it's about 800 miles,

00:31:01.433 --> 00:31:05.667
and it took anywhere between
one week and one month.

00:31:05.667 --> 00:31:10.000
The island is not as cold
as its name suggests.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.367
It has glaciers, but in the
parts that don't have

00:31:14.367 --> 00:31:20.867
glaciers, it's not
all that cold.

00:31:20.867 --> 00:31:22.833
Again, the Gulf Stream.

00:31:22.833 --> 00:31:25.633
Most of it is uninhabitable,
but that's

00:31:25.633 --> 00:31:27.400
because of volcanic rock.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.533
I don't know how many of you
have been to Iceland, but even

00:31:29.533 --> 00:31:34.033
the drive from the airport to
Reykjavik is intimidating,

00:31:34.033 --> 00:31:36.833
because it goes through the
stuff called "tufa".

00:31:36.833 --> 00:31:40.700
And there are no trees, and
there's sort of no prospect of

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.367
anything growing there.

00:31:44.367 --> 00:31:49.267
But on the other hand, there
are plenty of nice coastal

00:31:49.267 --> 00:31:52.933
strips, mild climate,
great pasture.

00:31:52.933 --> 00:31:54.733
There are almost no trees now.

00:31:54.733 --> 00:31:56.833
And there's a lot of debate
about whether there were

00:31:56.833 --> 00:31:59.933
trees, whether they just cut
them down, and they couldn't

00:31:59.933 --> 00:32:04.400
be re-cultivated.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.733
But in fact, this is a very
hospitable place: rich

00:32:07.733 --> 00:32:11.000
pastures, sea mammals
everywhere.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.800
Until Iceland completely lost
its mind in the speculative

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.700
atmosphere of the decade
preceding 2008, their main

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.433
industry was cod fishing.

00:32:23.433 --> 00:32:29.567
They then went into banking in
a way that just staggers the

00:32:29.567 --> 00:32:35.667
mind and have gotten back
into cod fishing, my

00:32:35.667 --> 00:32:38.967
understanding is.

00:32:38.967 --> 00:32:42.900
But they had lots and lots
of other things.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:47.133
Lots of seals which they killed
for fur, walrus skin

00:32:47.133 --> 00:32:52.433
used for cable for ropes for
ships, walrus ivory, another

00:32:52.433 --> 00:32:55.800
little creature called an
narwhal that has a tusk that

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.533
looks like a--

00:32:56.533 --> 00:32:59.667
well, it was taken for
being a unicorn tusk.

00:32:59.667 --> 00:33:04.000
There's one in the Cloisters,
for example, that some of you

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.367
are going to see on the
seventh of December.

00:33:09.367 --> 00:33:23.167
So the colonization of Iceland
begins in 870, and by 930, the

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:24.400
island is basically full.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.933
It's habitable land, again.

00:33:29.933 --> 00:33:32.267
A very, very small percentage
of the land

00:33:32.267 --> 00:33:35.867
area was fully settled.

00:33:35.867 --> 00:33:38.900
We know a lot more about Iceland
than any other part of

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:44.067
Scandinavia because of the
extraordinary quality and

00:33:44.067 --> 00:33:50.433
quantity of poetic stories,
sagas in which honor,

00:33:50.433 --> 00:33:53.800
treasure, and love of
mayhem dominate.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.400
These are very violent and until
a certain point were

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.767
taken to be realistic portrayals
of life in Iceland

00:34:01.767 --> 00:34:07.267
just as if, say, 1950s and 1960s
TV westerns were assumed

00:34:07.267 --> 00:34:10.733
to be a totally accurate
portrayal of life everywhere

00:34:10.733 --> 00:34:15.200
in the United States in the
nineteenth century.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:20.367
So these are, like Westerns,
wonderful stories of male

00:34:20.367 --> 00:34:22.967
violence with a certain amount
of exaggeration, but

00:34:22.967 --> 00:34:29.433
nevertheless the reflection of
customs, ways of speaking, and

00:34:29.433 --> 00:34:30.667
social values.

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:36.400
Towards the end of the tenth
century, Greenland was

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.967
explored under the leadership of
Erik the Red, one of these

00:34:40.967 --> 00:34:44.733
renegades so difficult and
violent that he was exiled

00:34:44.733 --> 00:34:48.333
from both Norway and Iceland.

00:34:48.333 --> 00:34:53.200
He is the one who seems to have
dubbed this new territory

00:34:53.200 --> 00:35:00.067
Greenland, a pioneer of
deceptive advertising, I think

00:35:00.067 --> 00:35:01.133
it's fair to say.

00:35:01.133 --> 00:35:06.133
Because warm as it may have
been in the tenth century,

00:35:06.133 --> 00:35:12.900
this is like calling some
housing development Warbling

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.733
Acres when in fact you've just
bulldozed all the trees in

00:35:15.733 --> 00:35:19.767
order to create the
development.

00:35:19.767 --> 00:35:26.367
So the western coast of
Greenland had rich pasture.

00:35:26.367 --> 00:35:32.933
The West is warmer than the
East. Settlers came

00:35:32.933 --> 00:35:34.867
beginning in 986.

00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:39.467
There was even a bishopric
established at a place called

00:35:39.467 --> 00:35:45.267
Gardar, another sort of
Tolkien-esque name.

00:35:45.267 --> 00:35:46.767
We don't know very
many bishops who

00:35:46.767 --> 00:35:48.167
actually went to Gardar.

00:35:48.167 --> 00:35:52.533
Most of them ruled from Denmark
and sort of basically

00:35:52.533 --> 00:35:55.400
told their flock to get in touch
with them if they needed

00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:00.967
them, gave them their office
hours and had a phone that

00:36:00.967 --> 00:36:02.200
took messages.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:09.367
But this settlement did not
last. Greenland was more or

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:14.200
less abandoned by 1400 and then
would later be, in modern

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.933
times, resettled, but this
time by Denmark.

00:36:18.933 --> 00:36:22.200
And then finally, Norwegians
from Greenland settled what's

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.867
now Labrador in Newfoundland,
late tenth,

00:36:24.867 --> 00:36:26.033
early eleventh centuries.

00:36:26.033 --> 00:36:31.067
They even wrote a saga called
the Vinland Saga.

00:36:31.067 --> 00:36:34.500
The Vinland Map that's in the
Beinecke Library that purports

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:41.500
to show both the Chinese
Mongol Empire and the

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.100
territories of Vinland
in the New World is

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:48.500
unfortunately a fake.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.633
But as I said, these
archaeological finds in

00:36:51.633 --> 00:36:55.900
Markland, as the Vikings called
Labrador, or Vinland,

00:36:55.900 --> 00:37:02.167
as they referred to
Newfoundland, are real.

00:37:02.167 --> 00:37:05.067
They were settled about
the year 1000 and

00:37:05.067 --> 00:37:09.600
abandoned in 1020.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.933
So here we are, 1020
or the year 1000.

00:37:14.933 --> 00:37:20.167
And I know that you will
be asking what has been

00:37:20.167 --> 00:37:26.167
accomplished since we
began with 284.

00:37:26.167 --> 00:37:29.000
And this is a fair question,
because at first glance, it

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.533
would seem as if we're still
in a world of declining

00:37:34.533 --> 00:37:44.200
population, a rural society with
very few urban centers, a

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:50.533
society of relatively little
literacy, relatively small

00:37:50.533 --> 00:37:58.933
amounts of commerce, lots of
violence, lack of governmental

00:37:58.933 --> 00:38:02.833
order, militarized society, all
developments that we have

00:38:02.833 --> 00:38:07.567
been tracing since
the beginning.

00:38:07.567 --> 00:38:11.800
The optimistic take on this
is that beginning with the

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.833
material covered in the next
course, there's a very rapid

00:38:14.833 --> 00:38:20.367
ascent from 1000 to about 1300,
a tremendous growth of

00:38:20.367 --> 00:38:26.333
the European economy and a
tremendous expansion of both

00:38:26.333 --> 00:38:30.133
population, artistic, political,
and intellectual

00:38:30.133 --> 00:38:36.667
creativity that is the central
period of the Middle Ages.

00:38:36.667 --> 00:38:40.400
The real mystery behind this,
the sort of historical

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:44.867
problem, is what explains the
domination of Europe in the

00:38:44.867 --> 00:38:46.367
second millennium AD?

00:38:46.367 --> 00:38:49.600
The first millennium, most of
which we've covered in this

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.933
course, the dominant areas are
the Mediterranean at the

00:38:54.933 --> 00:38:58.100
beginning, which includes
Europe, but also includes

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.167
North Africa, Egypt, the Middle

00:39:00.167 --> 00:39:03.033
East, and modern Turkey.

00:39:03.033 --> 00:39:08.800
And indeed, those latter regions
would outpace Europe,

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.800
properly speaking.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.733
The first millennium is
something of a catastrophe for

00:39:14.733 --> 00:39:20.667
Europe, at least by measurable
statistics of a per capita

00:39:20.667 --> 00:39:29.400
GNP, population, population
density, urbanization, nature.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.267
What then explains
the domination of

00:39:31.267 --> 00:39:34.900
Europe after 1000?

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.367
In some ways, it's
a slow process.

00:39:37.367 --> 00:39:41.433
The first European colonies
don't really get established

00:39:41.433 --> 00:39:45.633
until the aftermath of Columbus'
voyage in 1492.

00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:48.933
And then they get established
incredibly rapidly and with

00:39:48.933 --> 00:39:50.533
surprisingly little
effort, right?

00:39:50.533 --> 00:39:54.533
Mexico and Peru, these huge
empires of the Aztecs, Mayans,

00:39:54.533 --> 00:39:58.700
and Incas fall to a few hundred
Spanish troops.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:05.367
And the Spanish and Portuguese
between 1492 and 1520 are all

00:40:05.367 --> 00:40:10.500
over the world, from Malacca in
modern Malaysia to India to

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:15.467
the Persian Gulf to
Mexico and Peru.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.133
Well, we don't have
to explain that.

00:40:21.133 --> 00:40:22.967
That's for another time.

00:40:22.967 --> 00:40:27.400
But suffice it to say that
already in 1095, the European

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.267
Christian population is capable
of putting together an

00:40:31.267 --> 00:40:36.300
army to conquer Jerusalem from
Islam, a seemingly impossible

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:41.200
job, and certainly one that
required more than logistics

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.100
and resources but also a
certain kind of if not

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.400
fanaticism at least a real
motivation, religious

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.500
motivation.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.867
But nevertheless, it is a sign
of a certain kind of European

00:40:52.867 --> 00:40:56.167
power that one would not
have thought in the

00:40:56.167 --> 00:40:58.700
year 1000 was possible.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:04.700
In the year 1000, the smart
money, the Brookings

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:09.800
Institute, think tank, kind
of RAND Corporation, Bain

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:16.267
Consulting, all the smart people
would have said, "Don't

00:41:16.267 --> 00:41:17.267
put any money into Europe.

00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:19.000
You've got to be kidding.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.533
The coming regions are the same
as over the last couple

00:41:23.533 --> 00:41:24.667
hundred years.

00:41:24.667 --> 00:41:28.000
Maybe Byzantium,
a cautious buy.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.333
Definitely the Islamic
kingdoms, even if the

00:41:30.333 --> 00:41:33.467
Caliphate is having some
problems, qua Caliphate, their

00:41:33.467 --> 00:41:35.867
successor states,
Fatimid Egypt--

00:41:35.867 --> 00:41:36.800
awesome, awesome.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.367
This is going to dominate
for the next millennium.

00:41:40.367 --> 00:41:46.067
Our algorithms agree on this."

00:41:46.067 --> 00:41:50.533
And all sorts of promising signs
in Eastern Europe with

00:41:50.533 --> 00:41:53.800
the creation of Russia to your
more prescient younger,

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:58.567
hot-shottier consultants would
have identified that.

00:41:58.567 --> 00:42:07.133
But Germany, Italy, France, the
British Isles certainly

00:42:07.133 --> 00:42:08.967
would have seemed
discouraging.

00:42:08.967 --> 00:42:11.400
Yet there are some
promising signs.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.133
As it turns out, the Vikings
are the last invaders.

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:20.967
The Vikings coincide with
invasions from the Magyars.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:27.167
Magyars, that's what they call
themselves to this day.

00:42:27.167 --> 00:42:29.300
They're known as the Hungarians
to the outside

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.067
world out of a confusion between
them and the Huns.

00:42:32.067 --> 00:42:35.667
They actually have nothing
to do with the Huns.

00:42:35.667 --> 00:42:39.233
But they were quite frightening
land-based raiders

00:42:39.233 --> 00:42:40.767
of the tenth century.

00:42:40.767 --> 00:42:46.800
And there were also attacks by
ships from Muslim North Africa

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.600
against Europe, what
the sources refer

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.067
to as Saracen pirates.

00:42:51.067 --> 00:42:54.567
And they plunder Rome
in 843, for example.

00:42:54.567 --> 00:42:58.600
So Europe is certainly in the
tenth century faced with yet

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.567
another wave of invasions.

00:43:00.567 --> 00:43:02.633
And I think I warned you at the
beginning of this course

00:43:02.633 --> 00:43:06.967
that it was basically about
invasions and heresies and

00:43:06.967 --> 00:43:09.733
that you'd do well if you just
concentrated on those things.

00:43:09.733 --> 00:43:13.600
So we're heresy-free at the
moment, but in the tenth

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.800
century, we certainly have
these invasions.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.467
As it happens, they're the last
that Western Europe would

00:43:18.467 --> 00:43:19.933
experience.

00:43:19.933 --> 00:43:22.100
Not Eastern Europe, because
Eastern Europe would be

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.233
subject to the Mongols who
would, for example, score a

00:43:25.233 --> 00:43:28.800
tremendous victory over the
armies of Poland, armies of

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.933
the Christian king of
Hungary as well in

00:43:31.933 --> 00:43:34.367
the thirteenth century.

00:43:34.367 --> 00:43:38.133
But this seems to be the end of
invasions, the beginning of

00:43:38.133 --> 00:43:42.633
a period of population increase,
better nutrition,

00:43:42.633 --> 00:43:47.000
better harvests, perhaps
explicable to more settled

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.400
conditions, perhaps explainable
by improved

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.733
climate, perhaps just
explainable by human

00:43:54.733 --> 00:43:56.733
determination and enterprise.

00:43:59.467 --> 00:44:03.400
The Christianization of Europe
is one of the tremendous

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.000
phenomena that characterizes
our period.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.333
And while as a religious
movement I have no investment

00:44:11.333 --> 00:44:13.800
in saying that Christianity
is either an advantage or

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:18.300
disadvantage, in terms of
creating settled, organized

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.167
polities, the Christianization
of places like Scandinavia,

00:44:23.167 --> 00:44:26.200
Iceland, or Bohemia--

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.300
the modern Czech Republic
more or less--

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:34.367
or Hungary or Russia, all of
which take place in the tenth

00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:37.033
or early eleventh centuries,
all of these

00:44:37.033 --> 00:44:43.033
Christianizations, conversions
bring these polities into a

00:44:43.033 --> 00:44:49.300
kind of European cultural area,
political alliances,

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.000
trade networks.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.433
So Christianization is as much
a sign of civilization or at

00:44:56.433 --> 00:44:59.967
least of a kind of economic
development

00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:04.133
as a thing in itself.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:12.400
So between 200 and 1000, what
are the big differences?

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.000
Whether these are

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.200
accomplishments or not is
debatable.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.033
Certainly the population
has declined.

00:45:19.033 --> 00:45:22.700
Over an 800-year period, the
population of Europe is

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:27.233
considerably less, not only in
towns like Rome, which has

00:45:27.233 --> 00:45:32.033
gone from something on the order
of over 500,000, perhaps

00:45:32.033 --> 00:45:38.033
as much as a million,
to 30,000, maximum.

00:45:38.033 --> 00:45:42.000
It is a much less
Mediterranean-centered world.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.433
The sort of geopolitics
have changed.

00:45:44.433 --> 00:45:48.800
The Mediterranean has broken
apart into Islamic, Byzantine,

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.267
and Latin regions.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.767
It is Christian, most of it.

00:45:56.767 --> 00:46:03.000
Most of Europe apart from
Spain is Christian.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.567
And this entails all sorts
of cultural as well

00:46:06.567 --> 00:46:08.533
as religious changes.

00:46:08.533 --> 00:46:09.933
It is also less learned.

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:15.367
And the learning that there is
is a monopoly of the Church.

00:46:15.367 --> 00:46:22.100
There is less lay, or secular,
learning than there was.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.133
There are some continuities,
however.

00:46:25.133 --> 00:46:28.400
The dominant language of
learning and administration

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:34.500
remains in 1000, as it
was in 200, Latin.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:40.467
Roman culture is still the ideal
and still, in effect,

00:46:40.467 --> 00:46:43.700
the practice, even though
it may be adapted

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.033
to things like churches.

00:46:46.033 --> 00:46:50.167
But what has been called
Romanesque or simply Roman

00:46:50.167 --> 00:46:53.533
architecture particularly that
of the eleventh and early

00:46:53.533 --> 00:47:00.067
twelfth centuries will indeed be
based on Roman principles.

00:47:00.067 --> 00:47:03.633
And as we saw with Charlemagne,
the idea of Rome,

00:47:03.633 --> 00:47:08.467
the idea of the Empire
is extremely durable.

00:47:08.467 --> 00:47:11.767
And although Charlemagne's
empire is dissolved in the

00:47:11.767 --> 00:47:16.533
course of the late ninth
century, it is at least

00:47:16.533 --> 00:47:22.000
partially revived in the tenth
century under a new dynasty

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.767
whose first ruler is Otto
I, Otto the Great.

00:47:25.767 --> 00:47:32.500
In 962, he's crowned Roman
emperor in Rome by the pope.

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:38.467
His empire does not include the
West. So it's not France.

00:47:38.467 --> 00:47:42.433
It's more Germany than
anything else.

00:47:42.433 --> 00:47:46.833
But this empire would endure
until Napoleon, until 1804.

00:47:46.833 --> 00:47:57.833
In other words for something
on the order of 850 years.

00:47:57.833 --> 00:48:03.500
So to some extent, what we have
accomplished is we have

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.700
arrived at the point of the
emergence of something that

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.067
can be called Europe other
than a geographical term,

00:48:09.067 --> 00:48:12.833
something that can be called
Christendom, not using that in

00:48:12.833 --> 00:48:15.900
its triumphalist sense but
simply as a kind of cultural

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:20.533
description of a certain
part of the world.

00:48:20.533 --> 00:48:23.067
And we've reached the point
where we can start to talk

00:48:23.067 --> 00:48:27.500
about the West, this very
funny term still used,

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:32.100
particularly in popular
geopolitical tracts like The

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.467
West and the Rest, these kinds
of statements of the West or

00:48:36.467 --> 00:48:39.200
the decline of the West. We're
at the point of the rise of

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.100
the West.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:45.067
And that's where I am
going to leave you.

00:48:45.067 --> 00:48:47.833
Thanks for your participation
in this course.

00:48:47.833 --> 00:48:50.233
Thanks for making this a
wonderful semester for me.

00:48:50.233 --> 00:48:55.200
I hope a lot of fun
for you as well.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.433
Thanks a lot.

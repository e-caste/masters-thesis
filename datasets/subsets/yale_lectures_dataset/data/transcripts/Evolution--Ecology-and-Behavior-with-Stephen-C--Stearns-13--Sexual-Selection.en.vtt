00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.700
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.330
Tomorrow is Darwin's birthday.
 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.143
It's 200 years since he was
born, on the same day as Abraham

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:09.790
Lincoln.
 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.732
Astrologers have made a lot of
the fact that both men were

00:00:14.732 --> 00:00:17.160
deeply opposed to slavery.
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.480
But today we're going to talk
about sexual selection.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.480
So this is a Valentine's Day
lecture.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.580
&gt;
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.180
Sexual selection is actually a
component of natural selection.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.931
When Darwin looked at the
extravagant plumage of the birds

00:00:34.931 --> 00:00:38.090
that you just saw,
he thought there has got to be

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.460
something special going on here.
 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:55.310
&gt;
 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.110
When he saw all of these
extravagant behaviors,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.490
he thought there must be
something else going on,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.619
besides natural selection,
and that's because Darwin

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.668
thought that natural selection,
in some sense,

00:01:05.668 --> 00:01:07.150
was the survival of the
fittest.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.448
We now know that natural
selection really is the survival

00:01:10.448 --> 00:01:12.569
of those that reproduce the
best,

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.235
and that sexual selection is a
component of natural selection

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:18.739
that is associated with mating
success.

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:23.739
So basically sexual selection
is a case in which mating

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:27.349
success is trading off with
survival.

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:34.444
And to bring this home to you,
as you sit here in your 18 to

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:39.500
45-year-old state--
there are various ages in the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.664
audience--
I'd like you to consider the

00:01:42.664 --> 00:01:46.599
fact that the ratio of male to
female mortality,

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:50.623
in the United States,
starts to diverge early in

00:01:50.623 --> 00:01:54.876
life,
and by the time one has hit

00:01:54.876 --> 00:02:01.159
late teenage and early twenties,
the ratio of male to female

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.879
mortality is climbing rather
strikingly.

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:08.039
This is from all causes;
this is from external causes;

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.568
this is from internal causes.
 

00:02:09.568 --> 00:02:13.645
And actually this divergence
here is enough to account for

00:02:13.645 --> 00:02:17.580
the different life spans of
human males and females,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.199
which differ by about four or
five years.

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:25.448
Now that is sexual dimorphism,
and sexual dimorphism in

00:02:25.448 --> 00:02:29.145
mortality rates,
and it appears to be associated

00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:32.449
with blockheaded risk-taking
behavior.

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:36.468
It appears that males behave
differently at those ages than

00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:37.370
females do.
 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.758
Now we don't know whether
that's evolved and genetic,

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:42.949
or whether it's culturally
influenced,

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.712
but I invite you to consider
those alternative possibilities

00:02:46.712 --> 00:02:49.008
and think how one might test
them.

00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:51.964
From animal studies,
we know that the more

00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:55.710
polygynous the species,
the greater the difference in

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.800
male and female lifespan.
 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.780
There isn't any difference in
monogamous species.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.250
So if you look at swans or
other monogamous birds,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.750
the males and the females live
the same amount of time,

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.870
but the more polygamous a
species is,

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.008
the shorter the male's lifespan
relative to the female's.

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:16.508
So how does sexual selection
work?

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:18.340
It might account for that
pattern.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.970
How does it work?
 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.979
Well if a change in a trait is
going to increase lifetime

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:28.848
reproductive success,
by improving the ability of an

00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:32.068
individual to attract or to
control a mate,

00:03:32.068 --> 00:03:36.030
or to achieve fertilization,
it can be favored by selection,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.120
even if it lowers survival
probability.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.060
This is a Woody Allen film
about sex and death.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.203
Now sexual selection will
change traits that influence

00:03:48.203 --> 00:03:51.524
mating success until the
improvement in mating success is

00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:54.490
balanced by costs in other
fitness components;

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.310
then the response will stop.
 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.589
This will not go on to the
point where there's wholesale

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:01.020
slaughter and suicide.
 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.515
Although in some few cases
there is sexual cannibalism

00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:11.254
during copulation--
in the Australian Redback

00:04:11.254 --> 00:04:13.866
Spider-- and the male does
appear to insist on committing

00:04:13.866 --> 00:04:14.378
suicide.
 

00:04:14.378 --> 00:04:15.960
So that would be probably the
most extreme case.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.149
But that's not normal,
that's really an extreme case.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.894
The normal case is that if
there is sexual selection going

00:04:22.894 --> 00:04:25.226
on,
then the sexes will diverge in

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:27.680
their behavior and their
morphology,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.177
and their traits and their
behavior will be modified in

00:04:31.177 --> 00:04:34.740
ways so that they are getting
better mating success,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.199
but they are incurring costs,
in terms of survival.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.800
Now this line of thought
explains why organisms will take

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.815
risks to mate--
and often they will take

00:04:46.815 --> 00:04:50.762
extreme risks to mate--
and it explains why juveniles

00:04:50.762 --> 00:04:55.850
develop secondary sexual
characters only on maturation.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.720
That's because the secondary
sexual characters,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.968
which are the things that we
think of as causing the two

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.449
sexes to look different in any
species,

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.199
bear with them costs,
and those costs can be imposed

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.259
from a variety of sources.
 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.240
The costs may be that if you
look like an adult,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.863
you're going to elicit
competitive behavior from other

00:05:15.863 --> 00:05:18.310
adults--
you might get beaten up--or it

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.470
may that it simply makes it much
more difficult for you to escape

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.379
a predator.
 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.829
So the costs can come in from
all sorts of places.

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:31.596
The main questions about sexual
selection are how did it

00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:32.420
originate?
 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.358
And we are now pretty well
satisfied that before there was

00:05:35.358 --> 00:05:38.089
anisogamy, there could not be
any sexual selection.

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:40.350
There had to be gametes of
different sizes,

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.029
and there had to be individuals
specialized on producing small

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.588
ones and big ones before you
could start getting things that

00:05:47.588 --> 00:05:51.656
functioned as males and females,
and then evolve to begin to

00:05:51.656 --> 00:05:54.720
look like and behave like males
and females.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.500
The mechanisms of sexual
selection are basically two:

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.269
competing for mates and
choosing mates.

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:10.629
So there's force and subtlety
involved in this process.

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:13.269
There's a lot of evidence for
it.

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:16.360
This is, as you might imagine,
since we are among the more

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.745
sexual primates--
we're not quite as sexual as

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:21.002
bonobos,
but we are a relatively highly

00:06:21.002 --> 00:06:23.730
sexed primate--
it's not unusual that this is

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.922
an area of biology that has
attracted an awful lot of

00:06:26.922 --> 00:06:27.720
attention.
 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.170
You can find thousands of
papers on sexual selection.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.560
The strength of sexual
selection is actually on the day

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.790
of mating determined by the
operational sex ratio;

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.233
that is, the local ratio of
males that are ready to mate

00:06:43.233 --> 00:06:45.550
with females who are ready to
mate.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.930
Okay?
 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.600
So that's just a brief outline
of some of the main points.

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:57.350
Now about competing and
choosing.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.310
Competing and choosing have
different consequences.

00:07:04.588 --> 00:07:10.851
It is the limiting sex that can
be choosey--okay?--and normally

00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:14.790
individuals of the other sex
compete.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:20.620
Now it is quite possible that
if one sex is limiting,

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.600
and the other sex is competing
for the attentions of that sex,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.803
that the individuals among the
limited sex can actually compete

00:07:28.803 --> 00:07:32.329
with each other for the
attentions of the suitors.

00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:33.920
There's nothing ruling that out.
 

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.759
It's just that I'm describing
here the processes and forces

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:40.209
that are stronger in the two
sexes.

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:42.620
That doesn't mean that other
things aren't going on;

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.490
there's arguably a lot going on.
 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.136
Generally speaking,
mate competition will be

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:54.259
stronger in the sex that has the
greater reproductive potential,

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:57.125
and it's the one that should be
competing for the sex with the

00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:58.629
lesser reproductive potential.
 

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:02.690
And usually males have greater
reproductive potential,

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.139
females have lesser
reproductive potential;

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:10.920
so males compete and females
choose, generally speaking.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.459
You'll see that there are
interesting exceptions.

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:19.399
Now, what should a female
choose?

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:22.557
I'll already tell you this is a
big topic in evolutionary

00:08:22.557 --> 00:08:23.290
psychology.
 

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.177
David Buss, at the University
of Texas, wrote a big review

00:08:26.177 --> 00:08:27.800
paper on this a few years ago.
 

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.459
It's highly controversial.
 

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:31.350
It's fun to read this stuff.
 

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.639
It's difficult to come to a
hard science conclusion on it.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:37.980
Basically what Buss says is
that males choose young females

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.320
that look healthy and have high
reproductive potential,

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.774
and females choose males that
have access to resources and are

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.039
likely to contribute to child
rearing.

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:48.620
Okay?
 

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.308
And he says this is
cross-cultural;

00:08:50.308 --> 00:08:54.687
all cultures,
all times, that's what people

00:08:54.687 --> 00:08:55.210
do.
 

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.366
Obviously that could be
controversial,

00:08:57.366 --> 00:09:00.282
and there are a lot of
refinements on that picture,

00:09:00.282 --> 00:09:03.490
and there's a lot of evidence
that could be better.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.929
But that's what Buss claims.
 

00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:06.928
That's for humans.
 

00:09:06.928 --> 00:09:09.580
What about animals,
where you can actually do

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.192
experiments and do manipulations
and ask them to tell you why

00:09:13.192 --> 00:09:14.879
they are choosing mates?
 

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:18.700
Well here are some hypotheses.
 

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:24.971
A female could look at a male
and say, "Does he control

00:09:24.971 --> 00:09:27.309
important resources?
 

00:09:27.309 --> 00:09:28.528
Will that one be a good parent?
 

00:09:28.528 --> 00:09:30.490
Will it supply food
efficiently?"

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.104
Or, looking at it,
"Is that potential mate

00:09:34.104 --> 00:09:34.889
healthy?
 

00:09:34.889 --> 00:09:38.126
Is it free of parasites,
and is it advertising its

00:09:38.126 --> 00:09:42.158
ability to resist parasites and
pathogens with a costly signal

00:09:42.158 --> 00:09:46.386
that gives me an indication that
in fact that thing is honest and

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:49.029
is not trying to deceive
me?"

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:53.186
Or, "Does that potential
mate have traits that are

00:09:53.186 --> 00:09:55.649
attractive to sexual partners?
 

00:09:55.649 --> 00:09:58.590
Will I have a sexy son?"
 

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.788
Now this sets off a very
interesting co-evolutionary

00:10:02.788 --> 00:10:07.565
process between the preference
genes that are sitting there

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:12.753
being expressed in the female's
brain and the expression of that

00:10:12.753 --> 00:10:17.528
in the form of some kind of sexy
morphological trait in the

00:10:17.528 --> 00:10:19.668
male's morphology.
 

00:10:19.668 --> 00:10:23.565
And these genes for preference
and genes for attraction come

00:10:23.565 --> 00:10:27.197
together in the offspring,
and that has very interesting

00:10:27.197 --> 00:10:28.320
consequences.
 

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.440
Well what do we know about this?
 

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.379
André
Dhondt and his students,

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:39.754
who at that time were in
Belgium--and André

00:10:39.754 --> 00:10:43.331
is now at Cornell--
did an interesting study on

00:10:43.331 --> 00:10:44.200
Blue Tits.
 

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.153
Now the point about Blue Tits,
that makes them useful for

00:10:48.153 --> 00:10:52.389
this, is that they frequently
have extra-pair copulations.

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:55.320
That means that Blue Tits
indulge in adultery a lot.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.298
And because of genetic
fingerprinting,

00:10:58.298 --> 00:11:02.136
you can go out and you can
determine the paternity of

00:11:02.136 --> 00:11:05.534
offspring in this brood,
where the male is having his

00:11:05.534 --> 00:11:07.956
primary residence,
and in neighboring broods,

00:11:07.956 --> 00:11:10.899
and when the male flies out,
perhaps to have an extra-pair

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:13.340
copulation with a female in a
neighboring territory,

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.407
another male might fly in and
have an extra-pair copulation

00:11:16.407 --> 00:11:17.360
with his female.
 

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.570
And you can trace the
consequences of this.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.950
Okay?
 

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.456
We define as unattractive guys
that don't get much action,

00:11:25.456 --> 00:11:29.149
and we define as attractive
guys that get a lot of action.

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:29.769
Okay?
 

00:11:29.769 --> 00:11:32.490
So that's an operational
definition of attractive.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.474
And if the unattractive males
turned out to be smaller and

00:11:36.474 --> 00:11:39.480
they died younger than
attractive males--

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.697
so female Blue Tits are able to
pick up on something about the

00:11:43.697 --> 00:11:47.570
physical health of the males
that they're looking at--

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:52.940
the offspring of attractive
males, in their own home brood,

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.586
in their own home nest,
lived longer than the offspring

00:11:55.586 --> 00:11:56.860
of unattractive females.
 

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.596
Now you could explain that by
direct benefit rather than by

00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:04.267
females looking at some signal
in the male's morphology or

00:12:04.267 --> 00:12:07.360
behavior that he had especially
good genes,

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.927
if the attractive males had
better territories and were

00:12:10.927 --> 00:12:12.049
better parents.
 

00:12:12.049 --> 00:12:15.480
That we don't know a lot about.
 

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.928
If the extra-pair offspring of
the attractive males--

00:12:19.928 --> 00:12:23.600
so the babies that were laid in
other nests,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.340
in other territories and were
reared by other people;

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.000
so they were foster-children in
other territories--

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.841
if they also had better
survival, that would be hard to

00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:34.370
explain in terms of direct
phenotypic reward,

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.779
and would then indicate good
genes.

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:41.952
So this is an example to show
you how you can apply natural

00:12:41.952 --> 00:12:44.134
experiments,
in the field,

00:12:44.134 --> 00:12:47.972
to try to settle the question
of which hypothesis for sexual

00:12:47.972 --> 00:12:50.780
selection is correct--
is it good genes,

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.785
is it direct benefits?--
and show you that some of the

00:12:54.785 --> 00:12:57.990
evidence had been collected by I
think--

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.240
2002, I think,
is about when this came out.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.590
There may be more out there now
and you can go find out.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.404
At any rate,
this is something that can be

00:13:06.404 --> 00:13:10.250
done now with DNA fingerprinting
and with small birds.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.690
There is a sexual selection
maxim,

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.960
which is kind of a default
condition,

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.918
and that is eggs are expensive
and sperm are cheap,

00:13:18.918 --> 00:13:21.490
so females are limiting and are
going to be choosey,

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:25.717
and males have potentially
higher reproductive success over

00:13:25.717 --> 00:13:29.678
a lifetime than a female,
but probably also higher

00:13:29.678 --> 00:13:32.399
variance in reproductive
success.

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:36.200
And the consequence of this is
that the lifetime reproductive

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.745
success of the females is
basically limited by the number

00:13:39.745 --> 00:13:43.908
of offspring they can produce;
the lifetime reproductive

00:13:43.908 --> 00:13:47.604
success of males,
by the number of females they

00:13:47.604 --> 00:13:48.970
can fertilize.
 

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.730
That's really asymmetrical.
 

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.866
That means that in this default
condition the females become a

00:13:55.866 --> 00:13:59.056
limiting resource,
and that sets off competition

00:13:59.056 --> 00:14:00.820
among males for mates.
 

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.028
It allows females to choose
partners.

00:14:03.028 --> 00:14:06.250
And so usually females are
choosier than males,

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.470
and males are more promiscuous
than females.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.210
But there are a lot of
exceptions.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:14.345
Right at the end I'll show you
a couple of very beautiful

00:14:14.345 --> 00:14:18.480
polyandrous birds where females
hold harems of males,

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.755
and their morphology has been
changed so that in those species

00:14:22.755 --> 00:14:27.456
of birds they are the bright,
dominant, colorful ones,

00:14:27.456 --> 00:14:29.710
that look like males.
 

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:34.193
So this is a general principle,
and you should note that

00:14:34.193 --> 00:14:38.759
sometimes sperm are actually
more expensive than eggs;

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:41.139
it's not always true that sperm
are cheap.

00:14:41.139 --> 00:14:43.340
Here's a case.
 

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:49.467
This is a case in which the sex
that is choosey changes in a

00:14:49.467 --> 00:14:55.700
plastic fashion as a function of
how much food they have,

00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.351
and that's because in Katydids
males contribute nourishment to

00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:03.250
the females in their
spermatophores.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:07.384
So a female is not only getting
sperm from a male,

00:15:07.384 --> 00:15:10.340
she's getting food from the
male.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.759
Okay?
 

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:15.509
Now if food is scarce,
then female Katydids are

00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:20.563
actually reproductively limited
by how many male spermatophores

00:15:20.563 --> 00:15:21.950
they can get.
 

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:27.509
And at that point males back
off, they don't court so much,

00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:32.529
they get to be kind of coy,
and the females fight over the

00:15:32.529 --> 00:15:35.788
males and the males become
choosey.

00:15:35.788 --> 00:15:38.913
However, when the food is
abundant, the males are

00:15:38.913 --> 00:15:42.558
reproductively limited by the
availability of females;

00:15:42.558 --> 00:15:45.182
females are getting a lot of
food from sources other than

00:15:45.182 --> 00:15:47.913
spermatophores;
males court and females are

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:48.558
choosey.
 

00:15:48.558 --> 00:15:51.788
And you can take these and you
can just flip them back and

00:15:51.788 --> 00:15:55.129
forth, from one mode to the
other, just by how much you feed

00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:55.639
them.
 

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:57.480
So that's actually a nice test
case,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.585
because here you're taking the
same individual organisms and

00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:04.787
changing them with an
experimental manipulation

00:16:04.787 --> 00:16:07.710
between two different courtship
modes;

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:13.330
and it gets directly at this
idea.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.340
Now, what about competition for
mates?

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:21.309
There is a lot of armament out
there in Nature.

00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:22.600
You've seen some of it.
 

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.548
You've seen the antlers on deer.
 

00:16:24.548 --> 00:16:27.288
You've seen the tusks on
narwhales.

00:16:27.288 --> 00:16:30.970
You've seen the tusks on
elephants.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.567
You've seen that a male
silverback gorilla weighs 450

00:16:34.567 --> 00:16:37.889
pounds, and a female gorilla
weighs about 120.

00:16:37.889 --> 00:16:44.150
There are major differences in
body size of males and females

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.029
in many species.
 

00:16:46.029 --> 00:16:50.394
So these are set off--the
evolution of that difference in

00:16:50.394 --> 00:16:54.447
body size is really driven by
contests, scrambles and

00:16:54.447 --> 00:16:55.538
rivalries.
 

00:16:55.538 --> 00:16:59.558
And during these contests
females can be sitting there,

00:16:59.558 --> 00:17:02.528
looking at the males go at it,
fighting for access to them,

00:17:02.528 --> 00:17:04.978
and they could be choosing
males for their competitive

00:17:04.978 --> 00:17:05.440
ability.
 

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.059
So the fact that the males are
fighting isn't ruling out female

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:12.446
choice, it's making possible
perhaps another kind of female

00:17:12.446 --> 00:17:13.088
choice.
 

00:17:13.088 --> 00:17:16.309
That does explain large,
well-armed males,

00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:20.630
and the most striking examples
of this dimorphism are in

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.730
pinnipeds.
 

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:27.855
So here are two southern male
elephant seals,

00:17:27.855 --> 00:17:28.829
okay?
 

00:17:28.829 --> 00:17:30.548
Bull elephant seals.
 

00:17:30.548 --> 00:17:34.318
By the way, these guys are very
superior divers.

00:17:34.318 --> 00:17:39.160
They will go out offshore,
oh 100 miles or so,

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:45.930
and dive down to a depth of oh
between 1000 and 3000 feet,

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.578
to fish for squid,
and they're very good at it;

00:17:48.578 --> 00:17:51.531
they're kind of like little
mini whales cruising around out

00:17:51.531 --> 00:17:51.940
there.
 

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:56.455
And a male elephant seal will
spend about nine months a year

00:17:56.455 --> 00:18:00.088
storing up a lot of food,
because then he's going to haul

00:18:00.088 --> 00:18:02.778
up on a beach and try to protect
a harem on the beach,

00:18:02.778 --> 00:18:05.970
and try to chase off other
males and fight vigorously.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.180
And during that three months he
doesn't eat.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.318
He gets extremely grouchy.
 

00:18:14.318 --> 00:18:18.980
Now it is possible for these
guys to control a harem of about

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.318
forty or fifty female seals on
the beach.

00:18:22.318 --> 00:18:26.169
And it's not easy to run down a
beach if you're a 4000 pound

00:18:26.169 --> 00:18:27.538
male elephant seal.
 

00:18:27.538 --> 00:18:30.592
You are built for swimming
sleekly through the water,

00:18:30.592 --> 00:18:33.233
chasing squid,
not for humping along the beach

00:18:33.233 --> 00:18:34.642
with your four flippers.
 

00:18:34.642 --> 00:18:35.230
Okay?
 

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.328
But these guys do,
for three months,

00:18:37.328 --> 00:18:39.921
and they get all beaten up,
chasing off juvenile males that

00:18:39.921 --> 00:18:42.377
are coming in and trying to
sneak copulations with their

00:18:42.377 --> 00:18:42.868
harems.
 

00:18:42.868 --> 00:18:46.442
And, because of this spatial
situation, if you're a juvenile

00:18:46.442 --> 00:18:50.199
male, you can actually give the
females a little chance to make

00:18:50.199 --> 00:18:51.348
another choice.
 

00:18:51.348 --> 00:18:55.641
So the juvenile males hang out
sort of on the boundaries

00:18:55.641 --> 00:18:59.075
between the harems of the big
dominant males,

00:18:59.075 --> 00:19:01.650
and try to sneak copulations.
 

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.288
This sets off a situation of
controlled chaos that goes on

00:19:05.288 --> 00:19:08.160
for three months,
and everybody gets exhausted

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:08.990
fighting.
 

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:19.673
If you look at the ratio of
male body length to female body

00:19:19.673 --> 00:19:24.821
length,
and look at the harem size that

00:19:24.821 --> 00:19:29.882
a pinniped can control--
what you have here is data on

00:19:29.882 --> 00:19:31.690
different pinniped species.
 

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.406
This, I think,
is a harbor seal,

00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:38.273
which is virtually monogamous;
so harbor seals tend to mate

00:19:38.273 --> 00:19:39.380
for life.
 

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:45.458
But an elephant seal will be
about 1.6 times as long as a

00:19:45.458 --> 00:19:52.078
female, and that means it's how
much heavier than a female?

00:19:52.078 --> 00:19:54.609
What do you do with that 1.6 to
estimate the difference in

00:19:54.609 --> 00:19:55.009
weight?
 

00:20:00.329 --> 00:20:01.559
Can't hear you.
 

00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:02.289
Student:  Cube it.
 

00:20:02.289 --> 00:20:03.450
Prof: You cube it.
 

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.759
That's right.
 

00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:09.880
So that means that the male
elephant seal is on the order of

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.700
five or six times heavier than
the female.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:18.015
So if he's 4000 pounds,
she's about 850 pounds,

00:20:18.015 --> 00:20:20.078
something like that.
 

00:20:20.078 --> 00:20:26.118
And that's a pretty strong
relationship in biology,

00:20:26.118 --> 00:20:29.910
for sexual dimorphism versus
harem size,

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:34.430
and that illustrates the
importance of competition for

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:38.951
mates in controlling the
evolution of size differences

00:20:38.951 --> 00:20:41.509
between males and females.
 

00:20:41.509 --> 00:20:46.279
Now the one that's probably a
bit more fun is mate choice.

00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:49.546
I had a graduate student in
Switzerland who went to a

00:20:49.546 --> 00:20:52.058
behavioral ecology meeting in
Sweden,

00:20:52.058 --> 00:20:55.730
at a time when mate choice was
a hot topic in the literature.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.644
And it is a standard feature of
scientific meetings that in the

00:20:58.644 --> 00:21:01.700
evening there's a bar,
and people are talking at the

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.527
bar, and so she quietly went
around and decorated males with

00:21:05.527 --> 00:21:08.365
various things,
like feathers or whatnot,

00:21:08.365 --> 00:21:12.092
and then stood back and took
notes to see how long they got

00:21:12.092 --> 00:21:15.005
to chat up a woman,
depending upon what kind of

00:21:15.005 --> 00:21:16.598
decoration they were wearing.
 

00:21:16.598 --> 00:21:18.429
And she showed a very
significant effect,

00:21:18.429 --> 00:21:20.898
and the ones that looked
weirdest actually got the most

00:21:20.898 --> 00:21:21.539
attention.
 

00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:22.160
&gt;
 

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.480
So, just a tip. Okay?
 

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.380
&gt;
 

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:32.962
Now if you're really choosey
and you're able to detect high

00:21:32.962 --> 00:21:39.547
quality territories or good
genes or sexy sons or something

00:21:39.547 --> 00:21:43.325
like that,
you can improve your fitness by

00:21:43.325 --> 00:21:44.328
being choosey.
 

00:21:44.328 --> 00:21:49.269
But remember to be choosey you
have to take time.

00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:51.380
Choosiness is essentially
shopping.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.589
Right?
 

00:21:52.589 --> 00:21:54.480
Shopping takes time.
 

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.491
If you shop too long,
you may miss the opportunity

00:21:59.491 --> 00:22:02.970
because the shelf will be empty.
 

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.130
Okay?
 

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.630
So organisms should be careful,
but not too careful.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.400
There's kind of an optimal
waiting time,

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.400
and after awhile,
as the season progresses,

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.380
for a seasonally breeding
organism,

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.982
there's going to come a time
when mating with anybody is

00:22:18.982 --> 00:22:21.078
better than not mating at all.
 

00:22:21.078 --> 00:22:26.970
So this business of being
choosey is constrained by time.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:32.269
Now choice based on an
immediate phenotypic benefit--

00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:35.035
that means I'm going to choose
this mate because he's got a

00:22:35.035 --> 00:22:37.608
great territory and I'm going to
get a lot of food,

00:22:37.608 --> 00:22:40.298
or I can see that my babies
will have a lot of food;

00:22:40.298 --> 00:22:42.480
that would be an immediate
phenotypic benefit--

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.201
that can explain a lot,
but it won't explain

00:22:45.201 --> 00:22:47.670
extravagant male morphology or
leks,

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.313
and very often extravagant male
morphology and leks are

00:22:51.313 --> 00:22:53.269
associated with each other.
 

00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:57.348
You just saw some in the video
at the beginning.

00:22:57.348 --> 00:23:02.016
That Bird of Paradise was on a
lek, and I'll show you some more

00:23:02.016 --> 00:23:03.068
in a minute.
 

00:23:03.068 --> 00:23:06.631
So things that lek are
peacocks, sage-grouse,

00:23:06.631 --> 00:23:08.250
Birds of Paradise.
 

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:12.390
And a lek--it's one of the few
Swedish words which has been

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.390
appropriated into English.
 

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.420
Lek in Swedish means--has two
meanings.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.598
Meaning number one is a sports
place.

00:23:20.598 --> 00:23:23.403
So you can actually drive down
a road in Sweden and see a

00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:26.358
little sign that says Lek,
and you'll see a sports field.

00:23:26.358 --> 00:23:29.309
But it also means the same
thing that it does in behavioral

00:23:29.309 --> 00:23:32.471
ecology in English,
which is a traditional display

00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:36.487
ground where males come year
after year to advertise and try

00:23:36.487 --> 00:23:39.210
to attract females to mate with
them.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.558
Okay?
 

00:23:40.558 --> 00:23:44.279
And this is a mating system in
which the males are then not

00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:47.230
going to go off and take care of
the babies.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:51.720
The males sit there and display
and fight with each other.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:57.041
Females come and mate with
them, and the only thing that

00:23:57.041 --> 00:24:01.009
the female gets from the male is
genes.

00:24:01.009 --> 00:24:02.980
These are some things that lek.
 

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.635
This is a sage-grouse at
Malheur National Wildlife Refuge

00:24:06.635 --> 00:24:07.420
in Oregon.
 

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.798
This is a Bird of Paradise and
this is a peacock.

00:24:10.798 --> 00:24:13.858
Now these males--these are all
males--

00:24:13.858 --> 00:24:16.068
have pretty extravagant
morphology,

00:24:16.068 --> 00:24:18.329
but they not only have
extravagant morphology,

00:24:18.329 --> 00:24:19.558
they have extravagant behavior.
 

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:22.785
You saw what that Rifle Bird
was doing, waving its wings back

00:24:22.785 --> 00:24:23.430
and forth.
 

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.501
Anytime you see something like
this, you can bet that if you

00:24:26.501 --> 00:24:29.521
were out there and you saw it in
action that there would be

00:24:29.521 --> 00:24:32.519
feathers in motion;
there would be dances going on;

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:35.673
there would be really elaborate
stuff that these birds were

00:24:35.673 --> 00:24:38.118
doing with their behavior to
attract mates.

00:24:38.118 --> 00:24:41.338
For example,
the male sage-grouse in Malheur

00:24:41.338 --> 00:24:44.108
in Oregon go to the lek in
January.

00:24:44.108 --> 00:24:47.702
In January, in Eastern Oregon,
the temperature can be 20

00:24:47.702 --> 00:24:48.880
degrees below 0.
 

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.990
There's snow on the ground.
 

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.744
These guys are getting up in
the dark, before sunrise,

00:24:53.744 --> 00:24:56.708
to get out there on the lek,
to try to get a one-up on the

00:24:56.708 --> 00:24:57.538
competition.
 

00:24:57.538 --> 00:25:01.538
They puff up their breasts and
they make a popping sound when

00:25:01.538 --> 00:25:04.670
they do so, and then after they
pop they coo.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.094
So they go pop-pop,
coo, coo, pop-pop,

00:25:08.094 --> 00:25:08.650
coo.
 

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.868
You can hear them a kilometer
away.

00:25:10.868 --> 00:25:14.890
And they make themselves as
visible as possible.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.019
Around the lek there are
lurking coyotes.

00:25:17.019 --> 00:25:19.690
Overhead, cruising through the
air, there are Golden Eagles.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.721
These guys are taking major
risks to get up at five in the

00:25:22.721 --> 00:25:25.539
morning to go out and try to
make love in the snow.

00:25:25.539 --> 00:25:26.279
You know?
 

00:25:26.279 --> 00:25:28.058
&gt;
 

00:25:28.058 --> 00:25:30.848
That's a serious modification
of male behavior.

00:25:30.848 --> 00:25:33.150
Talk about being a prisoner of
your hormones.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:37.589
These guys are in jail.
 

00:25:37.589 --> 00:25:38.950
&gt;
 

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.229
So what kind of an experiment
could you do in the field to try

00:25:42.229 --> 00:25:44.380
to decide what's a female
looking for?

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.680
Well Malte Andersson had a
great idea.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.288
He wanted to work on the
African Widowbird.

00:25:49.288 --> 00:25:53.259
African Widowbirds have--the
males have naturally long tails,

00:25:53.259 --> 00:25:56.237
and they control territories
within which two,

00:25:56.237 --> 00:25:58.950
three, four,
five females might nest.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:03.463
So what Malte did--by the way,
he did this in Masai Mara,

00:26:03.463 --> 00:26:07.978
in Kenya--he shortened tails on
some Widowbirds by simply

00:26:07.978 --> 00:26:10.798
cutting them off with scissors.
 

00:26:10.798 --> 00:26:13.695
On his control group he cut the
tail off and glued it back

00:26:13.695 --> 00:26:15.828
together, so it didn't change in
length.

00:26:15.828 --> 00:26:19.315
And then on his experimental
group he cut the tail off--he

00:26:19.315 --> 00:26:22.923
took the cut tails from the
short-tailed ones and glued them

00:26:22.923 --> 00:26:24.880
on to make super long tails.
 

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.529
Okay?
 

00:26:25.529 --> 00:26:26.630
So he had three groups.
 

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:30.230
He had short-tailed controls
and real long tails.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:34.042
Now the ones with shortened
tails only averaged half a nest

00:26:34.042 --> 00:26:36.676
on their territory,
and the ones with the

00:26:36.676 --> 00:26:40.240
lengthened tails averaged nearly
two nests on their territory.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:46.471
Individuals were assigned at
random to these different

00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:47.529
groups.
 

00:26:47.529 --> 00:26:51.723
And so the data indicate that
female Widowbirds were building

00:26:51.723 --> 00:26:55.220
nests on territories of males
with longer tails.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.420
And then the question is,
if that's such a great thing,

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.817
if you're going to double your
reproductive success with a

00:27:00.817 --> 00:27:02.486
longer tail,
then why don't you already have

00:27:02.486 --> 00:27:02.618
it?
 

00:27:02.618 --> 00:27:05.778
Darn it, why hasn't evolution
done that to you?

00:27:05.778 --> 00:27:09.195
Well the answer is probably
that natural selection is

00:27:09.195 --> 00:27:13.401
preventing a further increase in
male tail length because females

00:27:13.401 --> 00:27:17.146
are preferring much longer tails
than are found in natural

00:27:17.146 --> 00:27:18.328
populations.
 

00:27:18.328 --> 00:27:21.400
It's fun to give this part of
the lecture in German,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.952
because those of you who know
German know the double meaning

00:27:24.952 --> 00:27:29.680
of Schwanz in German;
it's what you imagine.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.617
Okay, there's another
hypothesis, and that is what is

00:27:33.617 --> 00:27:35.358
a female looking for?
 

00:27:35.358 --> 00:27:41.598
Well she's looking for an
indication of good genes,

00:27:41.598 --> 00:27:46.172
under this hypothesis,
and that would mean that a

00:27:46.172 --> 00:27:51.316
female should prefer a male
displaying an honest costly

00:27:51.316 --> 00:27:54.087
signal--
notice here I've put

00:27:54.087 --> 00:27:57.588
honest and costly
together--

00:27:57.588 --> 00:28:01.765
an honest costly signal that
they contain genes for superior

00:28:01.765 --> 00:28:03.884
survival ability;
for example,

00:28:03.884 --> 00:28:07.820
genes for parasite and pathogen
resistance, even for different

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.788
MHC alleles.
 

00:28:08.788 --> 00:28:12.478
Now the vertebrate immune
system is partially integrated

00:28:12.478 --> 00:28:14.960
into the vertebrate nervous
system.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.368
The two systems can send each
other information.

00:28:17.368 --> 00:28:22.065
If there was a way that your
sensory system could pick up

00:28:22.065 --> 00:28:26.509
information on the composition
of the MHC alleles,

00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:30.098
in a potential partner,
and send it to your brain,

00:28:30.098 --> 00:28:32.950
that would affect your mate
choice.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:36.950
This leads into something that
you may enjoy looking at.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:40.761
If you're into ISI Web of
Science, type in T-shirt

00:28:40.761 --> 00:28:44.884
Experiment, and look at the
impact of body odor on how

00:28:44.884 --> 00:28:47.920
attractive a potential mate
smells.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.680
Okay?
 

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.856
It turns out that if you do
that, and then you do the DNA

00:28:53.856 --> 00:28:58.333
sequencing to see whether or not
the people who are reporting

00:28:58.333 --> 00:29:02.510
attractive or unattractive have
similar or dissimilar MHC

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.640
alleles,
the ones that are reporting

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.884
that a smell is attractive are
the ones who have different

00:29:09.884 --> 00:29:13.097
immune genes,
and the ones who are reporting

00:29:13.097 --> 00:29:16.538
that a smell is repugnant have
similar immune genes.

00:29:16.538 --> 00:29:18.960
And the way the immune system
works in the offspring,

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.497
to resist infectious disease,
is by generating diversity

00:29:22.497 --> 00:29:25.183
within the body,
and it can only do that if the

00:29:25.183 --> 00:29:26.210
genes are different.
 

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:30.073
So you have to find a mate with
different MHC alleles if you

00:29:30.073 --> 00:29:32.890
want to have disease resistant
offspring.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:36.608
And there is some evidence in
humans that in fact we do react

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:39.710
to scent and that there is
information in scent.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:41.480
By the way, this is well
established again--

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.008
it's not so well established in
humans because we can't do

00:29:44.008 --> 00:29:46.521
manipulation experiments--
but it is well established in

00:29:46.521 --> 00:29:48.038
mice,
that mice do this.

00:29:48.038 --> 00:29:53.548
And where people make mistakes
and they do mate with people who

00:29:53.548 --> 00:29:57.693
have similar MHC genes,
they get into a situation where

00:29:57.693 --> 00:30:00.180
there are multiple spontaneous
abortions.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:05.799
So it appears not only that
there is a level of selection at

00:30:05.799 --> 00:30:08.990
mate choice,
but there is also a level of

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:12.766
rejection of zygotes that are
potentially not going to resist

00:30:12.766 --> 00:30:14.150
infectious disease.
 

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.031
That's work by Carole Ober at
the University of Chicago,

00:30:17.031 --> 00:30:18.289
working on Hutterites.
 

00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:21.078
So interesting stuff here.
 

00:30:21.078 --> 00:30:23.910
Now what kind of evidence have
we got?

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:28.675
Well if a male produced an
ornament in order to advertise

00:30:28.675 --> 00:30:31.740
that he was resistant to
disease,

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.655
then you would expect that male
fitness would decrease with

00:30:35.655 --> 00:30:37.750
increased parasite infection.
 

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.480
So that would be an assumption
behind it;

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.108
that would be the selection
that was driving it.

00:30:41.108 --> 00:30:46.440
The condition of his ornaments
should decrease with increased

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.038
parasite burden.
 

00:30:48.038 --> 00:30:51.175
So the less he was able to
resist the parasites,

00:30:51.175 --> 00:30:55.180
the less dramatic an ornament
he would be able to express.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.470
So that means that that
ornament's got to be costly.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.224
Then there must be some
heritable variation in

00:31:02.224 --> 00:31:05.960
resistance, or there wouldn't be
any response to selection;

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.559
just go back to the first basic
four conditions for selection:

00:31:09.559 --> 00:31:10.798
that must be there.
 

00:31:10.798 --> 00:31:13.724
And if this holds,
then females should be choosing

00:31:13.724 --> 00:31:16.950
the most ornamented and the
least parasitized males.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.824
And there are three cases that
are pretty well worked out where

00:31:19.824 --> 00:31:21.910
that's exactly what appears to
be going on.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:25.700
So what female guppies appear
to be looking for are orange

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.230
spots in their males.
 

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:30.519
What female pheasants appear to
be looking for are red irises

00:31:30.519 --> 00:31:32.220
around the eyes of the males.
 

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.759
And what female barn swallows
appear to be looking for are

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:41.096
nice long symmetric tails;
they like the symmetry of the

00:31:41.096 --> 00:31:42.710
male's tail.
 

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:47.259
Now that would be a good genes
argument.

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:49.608
The male's got a gene for
parasite resistance,

00:31:49.608 --> 00:31:51.279
so I'm going to make with him.
 

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:52.710
That's a good gene.
 

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:57.154
And that is where the Fisherian
process of sexy sons would

00:31:57.154 --> 00:31:57.779
start.
 

00:31:57.779 --> 00:31:58.618
Okay?
 

00:31:58.618 --> 00:32:01.954
So I'm now shifting into the
argument for the third

00:32:01.954 --> 00:32:04.412
hypothesis,
which is you choose a male

00:32:04.412 --> 00:32:07.338
because you think that if you
have a son by him,

00:32:07.338 --> 00:32:10.140
that son will get a lot of
matings.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.345
So preference for good genes
will select for the preference

00:32:14.345 --> 00:32:16.416
itself,
and that makes the preferred

00:32:16.416 --> 00:32:19.421
trait an object of selection,
and it explains the evolution

00:32:19.421 --> 00:32:20.359
of ornamentation.
 

00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:21.890
You can see it like this.
 

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.833
Suppose the reason a female
guppy likes a male with an

00:32:24.833 --> 00:32:28.332
orange spot is that the only way
he can make that orange spot is

00:32:28.332 --> 00:32:31.720
if he gets carotenoids out of
the crustacea that he eats.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.446
So if he's really good at
finding high quality food,

00:32:34.446 --> 00:32:36.318
he can make a bigger orange
spot.

00:32:36.318 --> 00:32:38.838
So it's advertising his
foraging ability.

00:32:38.838 --> 00:32:39.279
Okay?
 

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:40.950
That's a good thing.
 

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:46.327
So that gene for foraging
ability comes together in the

00:32:46.327 --> 00:32:50.910
offspring with the gene for the
preference,

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:54.450
and because the male has better
foraging ability,

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.114
the gene for the preference
will hitchhike on the

00:32:57.114 --> 00:33:00.500
reproductive success of the gene
for the foraging ability,

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.096
and females will develop
stronger and stronger

00:33:03.096 --> 00:33:05.578
preferences for a male with
orange spots.

00:33:05.578 --> 00:33:09.690
So that's how the process gets
going, at the beginning.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:13.381
It's thought that initially the
preference develops because it's

00:33:13.381 --> 00:33:16.721
a preference for a gene that
actually affects reproductive

00:33:16.721 --> 00:33:18.480
success in your offspring.
 

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.172
What if now that guppy
population moves into a new

00:33:22.172 --> 00:33:25.940
habitat that doesn't have any
crustacean in it,

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.772
and it becomes difficult
perhaps for the males to make

00:33:30.772 --> 00:33:32.048
carotenoids?
 

00:33:32.048 --> 00:33:34.205
But they still can,
they can still make orange

00:33:34.205 --> 00:33:34.588
spots.
 

00:33:34.588 --> 00:33:37.450
But the females have the
preference.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:41.396
The male is no longer giving
off a signal that's reliable in

00:33:41.396 --> 00:33:42.868
terms of good genes.
 

00:33:42.868 --> 00:33:48.068
All he is signaling is that
he's attractive to females.

00:33:48.068 --> 00:33:52.554
Well now evolution has a new
reason to maintain that

00:33:52.554 --> 00:33:53.608
selection.
 

00:33:53.608 --> 00:33:59.358
It's a selection simply for the
attractiveness of the offspring,

00:33:59.358 --> 00:34:02.834
because a component of
reproductive success is mating

00:34:02.834 --> 00:34:05.474
success,
and by choosing a male that has

00:34:05.474 --> 00:34:08.547
an orange spot,
the female is also choosing

00:34:08.547 --> 00:34:10.650
mating success in her sons.
 

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:19.280
So that leads to runaway
selection for sexy sons.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.539
So females are preferring males
with higher fitness.

00:34:22.539 --> 00:34:24.800
Their preference genes get
united in their offspring,

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.670
with the male's genes for
higher fitness.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:30.186
The female preference genes
then hitchhike on the male's

00:34:30.186 --> 00:34:31.210
fitness genes.
 

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.550
Once their preferences are
established,

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.679
they work on male traits that
are otherwise neutral,

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:40.492
or maybe even disadvantageous,
except that they are preferred

00:34:40.492 --> 00:34:41.320
by females.
 

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.360
So they lead to success in
mating.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.586
So then, if all that happens,
then mothers will gain in

00:34:47.586 --> 00:34:51.112
fitness by selecting fathers
with heritable traits that make

00:34:51.112 --> 00:34:54.699
their sons attractive to females
in the next generation.

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:58.757
In the threespine stickleback,
the intensity of the son's red

00:34:58.757 --> 00:35:02.679
coloration is correlated with
the daughter's preference for

00:35:02.679 --> 00:35:03.219
red.
 

00:35:03.219 --> 00:35:06.335
So what I've just told you
about the genes for preference

00:35:06.335 --> 00:35:09.893
and the genes for the male trait
coming together in the offspring

00:35:09.893 --> 00:35:12.659
happens to be true,
in sticklebacks.

00:35:12.659 --> 00:35:15.195
But when you then ask,
"What's the deal with red

00:35:15.195 --> 00:35:17.780
color on the belly of the male
stickleback?",

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.721
you discover that it's not only
genetically correlated with

00:35:21.721 --> 00:35:26.766
female preference;
bright red males resist

00:35:26.766 --> 00:35:28.530
parasites.
 

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.701
So by choosing them,
females are avoiding

00:35:31.701 --> 00:35:35.347
parasitized males,
and that's also satisfying a

00:35:35.347 --> 00:35:37.409
good genes hypothesis.
 

00:35:37.409 --> 00:35:42.085
So you can see that in this
case, the data in fact do not

00:35:42.085 --> 00:35:44.590
distinguish between the two.
 

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:45.889
It's not like it's either/or.
 

00:35:45.889 --> 00:35:47.789
It looks like,
hey, both things are going on

00:35:47.789 --> 00:35:48.630
at the same time.
 

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:54.980
Females are choosing sexy sons
who are also parasite resistant.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:59.213
Now there's a third
possibility, and that is let's

00:35:59.213 --> 00:36:04.313
suppose this kind of thing has
been going on in the past and

00:36:04.313 --> 00:36:08.980
females have developed certain
sensory abilities,

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.960
to perceive the potential mates.
 

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:16.302
You guys are not particularly
good at perceiving potential

00:36:16.302 --> 00:36:18.360
mates in the ultraviolet.
 

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.489
Okay?
 

00:36:19.489 --> 00:36:23.440
Bees are, but you're not.
 

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.965
So your sensory capacity is
limited to certain windows,

00:36:26.965 --> 00:36:30.623
both with your eyes and your
ears and your taste buds and

00:36:30.623 --> 00:36:31.929
everything else.
 

00:36:31.929 --> 00:36:37.114
And the idea is that the
sensory capacity inherited from

00:36:37.114 --> 00:36:40.320
ancestors would bias the traits.
 

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:45.556
Females might just be selecting
males they can see or hear

00:36:45.556 --> 00:36:47.210
especially well.
 

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:51.673
So one well worked out example
is that the female eardrum in a

00:36:51.673 --> 00:36:56.065
Tungara frog is tuned to receive
some frequencies better than

00:36:56.065 --> 00:36:56.869
others.
 

00:36:56.869 --> 00:37:01.650
Here is a male Tungara frog in
Panama calling,

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:06.599
and his call signal is being
picked up by the ear of the

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:10.284
female,
and he can't change his call

00:37:10.284 --> 00:37:15.954
signal out of the frequency
range that that female ear can

00:37:15.954 --> 00:37:16.750
hear.
 

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:20.889
If she is attracted to him,
he has reproductive success.

00:37:20.889 --> 00:37:24.677
But unfortunately,
that's a perfectly fine

00:37:24.677 --> 00:37:27.449
frequency for a bat to hear.
 

00:37:27.449 --> 00:37:32.429
And in fact a fringe-lipped bat
is a frog eating bat,

00:37:32.429 --> 00:37:36.295
and it does exceptionally well
during frog breeding season by

00:37:36.295 --> 00:37:40.289
swooping in and munching up the
males who are dutifully calling

00:37:40.289 --> 00:37:42.610
to try to attract their females.
 

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:47.154
Now the idea here is that the
male can't evolve out of a

00:37:47.154 --> 00:37:51.864
frequency range that the bat can
hear because the female's

00:37:51.864 --> 00:37:55.829
eardrum is constrained to be a
certain size;

00:37:55.829 --> 00:38:00.349
that's the sensory bias
hypothesis.

00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:07.170
Now, so I've stepped through
the main hypotheses that are

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:11.190
thought to drive female choice.
 

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:16.068
So female choice could simply
be for things that she can hear

00:38:16.068 --> 00:38:20.295
or see particularly well,
as well as for sexy sons or

00:38:20.295 --> 00:38:23.059
direct benefits or good genes.
 

00:38:23.059 --> 00:38:26.650
Now what is the actual context
in which this is going on?

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:30.472
Well it's when mating is
happening, when choice is being

00:38:30.472 --> 00:38:30.960
made.
 

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:37.005
And that's where the
operational sex ratio comes into

00:38:37.005 --> 00:38:37.820
play.
 

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:41.244
It basically is determining the
opportunity for selection,

00:38:41.244 --> 00:38:44.429
and it varies with mating
system and parental care.

00:38:44.429 --> 00:38:47.264
So sexual selection,
which produces striking

00:38:47.264 --> 00:38:51.679
differences in the behavior and
morphology of males and females,

00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:56.059
is correlated in ecology and
evolution with mating systems

00:38:56.059 --> 00:38:58.518
and patterns of parental care.
 

00:38:58.518 --> 00:39:04.157
These things all go along with
each other to form syndromes of

00:39:04.157 --> 00:39:04.989
traits.
 

00:39:04.989 --> 00:39:07.317
In monogamy,
equal numbers of males and

00:39:07.317 --> 00:39:10.817
females have offspring,
and each sex has one partner,

00:39:10.817 --> 00:39:14.369
and there's not very much
difference in the operational

00:39:14.369 --> 00:39:17.262
sex ratio and not much
opportunity for sexual

00:39:17.262 --> 00:39:18.250
selection.
 

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:22.206
In polyandry there are more
males than females,

00:39:22.206 --> 00:39:26.592
that have offspring,
and each female has two or more

00:39:26.592 --> 00:39:28.139
male partners.
 

00:39:28.139 --> 00:39:32.115
So there is great variance in
reproductive success among

00:39:32.115 --> 00:39:34.317
females;
there's less variance in

00:39:34.317 --> 00:39:36.409
reproductive success among
males.

00:39:36.409 --> 00:39:38.376
In the reverse pattern,
in polygyny,

00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:41.746
more females than males have
offspring, and each male has two

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:44.960
or more female partners;
that leads to harems and leks.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.320
And then there are things like
polygynandry where each sex may

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.429
have several partners.
 

00:39:52.429 --> 00:39:56.849
There's a little brown bird,
an LBB, called the Dunnock.

00:39:56.849 --> 00:39:59.860
It looks a little bit like a
hedge sparrow.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:03.079
It lives, among other places,
in the botanical garden at

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:07.090
Cambridge University in England,
where Nick Davies has studied

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:12.012
it for a long time,
and it had the notoriety of

00:40:12.012 --> 00:40:18.760
being regarded as an exemplar of
marital fidelity,

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.239
until Nick studied it.
 

00:40:21.239 --> 00:40:24.753
And once Nick got in there with
his DNA fingerprinting and did

00:40:24.753 --> 00:40:27.632
paternity analysis,
he discovered that Dunnocks are

00:40:27.632 --> 00:40:28.670
polygynandous.
 

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:34.090
So each sex is mating with
several partners.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:36.896
A female sitting on a nest will
have eggs in it that were

00:40:36.896 --> 00:40:40.065
inseminated by several males,
and the father who's bringing

00:40:40.065 --> 00:40:43.199
food to that nest has his genes
in eggs that are in several

00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:44.010
other nests.
 

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:47.800
So that's polygynandry,
and well exemplified in the

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.559
Dunnock.
 

00:40:48.559 --> 00:40:53.463
Now the effects of mate choice
are thought to be especially

00:40:53.463 --> 00:40:56.929
strong in these two
circumstances here.

00:40:56.929 --> 00:41:00.297
That's where one sex has
relatively little variance in

00:41:00.297 --> 00:41:03.297
reproductive success;
the other has large variance in

00:41:03.297 --> 00:41:04.389
reproductive success.
 

00:41:04.389 --> 00:41:07.389
One sex is limiting;
the other sex is competing.

00:41:07.389 --> 00:41:13.639
One sex is choosey;
the other sex is fighting.

00:41:13.639 --> 00:41:17.360
I told you that I would show
you some polyandrous birds.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.980
This is a Wattled Jacana,
and the Jacanas--

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:25.639
we ran into them on the
Amazon--a Jacana female will

00:41:25.639 --> 00:41:28.440
hold a territory within which
three,

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.380
four or five males will build
nests,

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.496
and she will go around and
lay--they'll fertilize her and

00:41:33.496 --> 00:41:35.889
she'll lay eggs into each of
their nests.

00:41:35.889 --> 00:41:37.836
But she doesn't spend any time
raising the babies,

00:41:37.836 --> 00:41:40.420
she just fights off the females
on the neighboring territories.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:44.583
So males take care of the
babies and mom fights for the

00:41:44.583 --> 00:41:47.202
territory;
and that happens in the Wattled

00:41:47.202 --> 00:41:47.639
Jacana.
 

00:41:47.639 --> 00:41:52.619
This is a Phalarope;
this is a female Phalarope.

00:41:52.619 --> 00:41:55.599
They are basically related to
the Sandpipers;

00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:56.699
so they're shore birds.
 

00:41:56.699 --> 00:41:58.440
They live in the far Arctic.
 

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.210
And a similar pattern.
 

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.489
The male sits on the eggs.
 

00:42:02.489 --> 00:42:05.987
A female holds a territory
within which three,

00:42:05.987 --> 00:42:08.320
four, five males have nests.
 

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:13.016
And there've been some very
interesting studies done on the

00:42:13.016 --> 00:42:15.768
mating physiology of Phalaropes.
 

00:42:15.768 --> 00:42:21.181
When a female Phalarope is
displaying, in her courtship

00:42:21.181 --> 00:42:26.795
display, and attracting males,
her ovaries are expressing

00:42:26.795 --> 00:42:28.500
testosterone.
 

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.865
You could imagine that the
courtship display of the female

00:42:32.865 --> 00:42:36.389
Phalarope had evolved in an
ancestral male,

00:42:36.389 --> 00:42:40.253
and that all of the control
machinery for that was all set

00:42:40.253 --> 00:42:42.083
up,
and all you had to do to get it

00:42:42.083 --> 00:42:44.885
expressed in the other sex was
turn on the testosterone at the

00:42:44.885 --> 00:42:47.318
right time;
which is what her ovaries do

00:42:47.318 --> 00:42:48.789
when she's displaying.
 

00:42:48.789 --> 00:42:51.929
When she then goes over to the
nest to lay the eggs,

00:42:51.929 --> 00:42:55.840
her ovaries secrete estrogen,
and she--

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.472
her physiology is switching
back and forth between a male

00:42:59.472 --> 00:43:03.277
display in competitive cycle,
driven by testosterone,

00:43:03.277 --> 00:43:07.409
and a female lay egg and make
yolk and lay egg cycle,

00:43:07.409 --> 00:43:10.460
which is controlled by estrogen.
 

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:15.541
So these sorts of secondary
sexual traits are not only

00:43:15.541 --> 00:43:21.679
associated with mating systems
and patterns of parental care,

00:43:21.679 --> 00:43:25.570
they also set off a cascade of
physiological integration

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:30.242
throughout the organism,
and uncovering that leads one

00:43:30.242 --> 00:43:35.768
into a whole host of interesting
physiological questions.

00:43:35.768 --> 00:43:38.489
So to summarize sexual
selection.

00:43:38.489 --> 00:43:41.938
It's a component of natural
selection in which mating

00:43:41.938 --> 00:43:44.260
success trades off with
survival.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.929
It's not a separate kind of
selection, it's part of natural

00:43:47.929 --> 00:43:48.690
selection.
 

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:52.068
It accounts for many of the
attractive ornaments of plants

00:43:52.068 --> 00:43:52.900
and animals.
 

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.074
It raises the interesting issue
of aesthetics and why our brains

00:43:57.074 --> 00:44:01.050
see things as beautiful that
other things find attractive.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:05.503
There is contest competition
for mates which are the scarcer

00:44:05.503 --> 00:44:08.987
reproductive resource,
and that will explain a lot of

00:44:08.987 --> 00:44:11.795
sexual size dimorphism--
bull elephant seals,

00:44:11.795 --> 00:44:14.699
things like that--
particularly in polygenous

00:44:14.699 --> 00:44:15.219
species.
 

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:18.344
We've seen there that the
degree of dimorphism is directly

00:44:18.344 --> 00:44:20.320
related to the degree of
polygamy;

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.659
the bigger the harem,
the bigger the size dimorphism.

00:44:23.659 --> 00:44:28.822
There has been a lot of
documentation actually of active

00:44:28.822 --> 00:44:32.860
choice of the non-limiting sex
sometimes.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.030
So that's going on.
 

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:39.150
And whether or not this
indirect mechanism--

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:43.320
this Fisherian runaway process,
that leads to preference for

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.208
sexy sons--
whether that is really needed

00:44:46.208 --> 00:44:49.059
to explain ornaments in lekking
species,

00:44:49.059 --> 00:44:53.170
it seems to be logically the
only possible explanation left

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:53.949
standing.
 

00:44:53.949 --> 00:44:56.842
It's as though you have
ruled--you're Sherlock Holmes

00:44:56.842 --> 00:44:59.679
and you've ruled out all of the
other hypotheses.

00:44:59.679 --> 00:45:02.751
But getting positive evidence
for that has been difficult.

00:45:02.751 --> 00:45:03.130
Okay?
 

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.280
So this looks plausible.
 

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.429
I think it's likely,
but at this point the positive

00:45:07.429 --> 00:45:10.958
evidence indicating that that
has been under selection is

00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:12.219
still out there.
 

00:45:12.219 --> 00:45:17.492
Getting whole genomes of some
of these organisms might solve

00:45:17.492 --> 00:45:19.489
it,
because you can then look for

00:45:19.489 --> 00:45:22.163
signatures of selection,
if you can identify the

00:45:22.163 --> 00:45:26.309
preference genes;
that's a long-term project.

00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:27.510
So let's go back to this.
 

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:28.820
I'd like to leave you with this.
 

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:29.780
This is you guys.
 

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.396
Here you are;
you're probably somewhere

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:34.050
around this age group.
 

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:37.496
And the mortality rates of the
males in the audience,

00:45:37.496 --> 00:45:41.143
on average--every insurance
company in the country knows

00:45:41.143 --> 00:45:43.436
this;
every time you apply for car

00:45:43.436 --> 00:45:46.893
insurance this difference
manifests itself in your monthly

00:45:46.893 --> 00:45:49.769
bill--
the mortality rates for male

00:45:49.769 --> 00:45:54.929
humans at this age are several
times those of female humans,

00:45:54.929 --> 00:45:56.980
and they appear to be taking
risks.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.932
So I'll leave you with the
unanswered question of whether

00:45:59.932 --> 00:46:02.360
that's a product of sexual
selection or not.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:06.000
And next time we will talk
about speciation.

WAI CHEE DIMOCK: For
now, I just want to

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.667
give you some biographical

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:11.533
details that might be a kind
of interesting parallel to

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.833
basically the entire
body of work by

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:16.933
Fitzgerald that we're seeing.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:21.500
Last time, we already saw that
Fitzgerald was married to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.767
Zelda Sayer.

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:33.400
And she was basically the social
center in Montgomery,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.267
Alabama where he
was stationed.

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:42.000
So he referred to her as the
first American flapper.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.833
So obviously that has resonances
for the story

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:49.933
"Bernice Bobs Her Hair." We
know that that is where he

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.567
gets part of his inspiration.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.800
And he has other stories
about flappers.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.633
As we know, he has a whole
collection called Flappers and

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:02.633
Philosophers.

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:09.733
So Zelda has been there pretty
much from quite early on in

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.067
the short stories.

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:15.333
But really, the work in which
Zelda has the most important

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.867
presence is Tender
is the Night.

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:21.733
So just some interesting
details,

00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.433
some interesting parallels.

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:27.967
Some of you might have been
surprised that Nicole refers

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:34.500
to Dick as Captain Diver when
she writes to him from the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.967
sanatorium.

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:39.867
And it's not really very well
accounted for, because Dick,

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:43.567
in fact, did not really fight.

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:48.067
He was considered too valuable
to be lost in battle.

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:52.400
So he was in Switzerland, and
he was not in combat.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.767
But Nicole refers to him
as Captain Diver.

00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:59.867
And in turns out that this is a
kind of interesting personal

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:04.800
connection to Fitzgerald's
own life and

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.500
his relation to Zelda.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.833
It turns out that in the
Fitzgerald collection that I

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:13.500
was talking about last time
at the University of South

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.533
Carolina, they have a couple of
very prized items in that

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:20.533
collection.

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:26.333
One is this briefcase saying
"F. Scott Fitzgerald, Fifth

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:27.400
Avenue."

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.633
And the other is this
hip flask with an

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:32.767
inscription from it.

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:37.533
And it turns out that this is
a gift from Zelda to Scott

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:40.300
before they were married, when
they were just courting.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.500
And this is the inscription
on that flask.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.233
"To 1st Lt.

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:51.000
F. Scott Fitzgerald, 65th
Infantry, Camp Sheridan,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.733
Forget-me-not, Zelda,
September 13, 1918,

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:57.700
Montgomery, Ala."

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.067
So in turns out that the
military rank is a small

00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:05.300
personal detail in
the courtship.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.833
The attribution of military rank
that, in fact, was not

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:12.767
really the real professional
identity for

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:16.000
Fitzgerald at any point.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.067
He was there.

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:17.800
He was in Montgomery.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.667
He was not fighting either
in Montgomery, Alabama.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:25.533
But she referred to him as 1st
lieutenant as the more

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:26.533
dignified title.

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:30.133
And we'll see that titles,
whether one is referred to as

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:34.267
Doctor or Mister, actually makes
a difference in Tender

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:34.833
Is the Night.

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:37.467
So from the very beginning, a
kind of title consciousness on

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:41.167
the part of Fitzgerald, I guess,
translated into Captain

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:44.867
Diver in Tender Is the Night.

00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:47.967
But that's just a very,
very small connection.

00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:50.467
The most important connections,
as some of you

00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:53.400
might know, has to do with a
fairly long history, a long

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.467
and painful history of
mental instability

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:58.233
on the part of Zelda.

00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:04.133
Basically from the 1930s on,
she never was not inside a

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:08.933
clinic at some point during
her career until she died.

00:04:08.933 --> 00:04:13.567
She was in and out of mental
institutions, some more

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:14.867
luxurious than others.

00:04:14.867 --> 00:04:17.033
Some not looking like a mental
institution at all.

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:18.833
So we'll begin with those.

00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:24.300
Anyway, this is the reference
to him as Captain Diver in

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.233
Tender Is the Night.

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:27.867
But this is one of the first
that she when to.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:30.500
I think it might even have
been the first, called

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.233
Prangins in Switzerland.

00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:39.267
And we'll see a picture
of her room there.

00:04:39.267 --> 00:04:42.433
That was in 1930.

00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:47.500
And as you can see, almost like
a hotel room, not looking

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.367
like the ideal of a mental
institution, certainly.

00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:54.600
Not the place where Darl would
go to when he goes to Jackson,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.233
Mississippi.

00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:58.233
So at the very other end
of the social spectrum.

00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:02.800
That's where she started out
when she began her long career

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.267
of medicalization.

00:05:05.267 --> 00:05:11.833
And this is the picture of her
release from Prangins.

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:14.433
And you can see that she
actually looks very different

00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:18.300
from when she was 18.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.733
Almost unrecognizable,
the two of them.

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:24.033
I guess it's separated by a
number of years as well.

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:27.833
But really looking very,
very different.

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:34.700
And I think that was the
earliest instance in 1930.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.833
That was an unduly optimistic
diagnosis that she was

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:44.000
recovered, that she recovered
from the breakdown.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.033
Because she was very soon
hospitalized again.

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:52.167
And this time in another even
more famous Swiss clinic,

00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:58.033
Burgholtzi, which is where
Jung actually practiced.

00:05:58.033 --> 00:06:00.833
And I think Freud actually was
there briefly as well.

00:06:00.833 --> 00:06:03.800
So in Tender is the Night,
there's a reference to Freud

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.300
that Dick Diver's to get to
Vienna before Freud retires,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.800
and there's also the
Swiss clinic.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.333
So all of that is, in part, has
a connection to Zelda's

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:19.567
own medical history
in Switzerland.

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:25.033
And then she went to a
bunch of other ones.

00:06:25.033 --> 00:06:27.233
I can't even keep track of
all the different one's

00:06:27.233 --> 00:06:28.933
that she went to.

00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:33.933
But at some point in 1932, she
went to Johns Hopkins.

00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:35.900
They were back in
this country.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.733
She went to Johns Hopkins
hospital.

00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:41.467
And that turned out to have
quite an important effect on

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:42.233
both of them.

00:06:42.233 --> 00:06:47.433
Because when she was at Hopkins,
part of the treatment

00:06:47.433 --> 00:06:50.400
was that she would have to write
for two hours a day.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.767
That was part of the
medical treatment.

00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:56.000
So she started writing.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.700
And she wrote a novel called
Save Me the Waltz, which was

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.500
published in 1932.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.133
It was only about 1,000
copies sold.

00:07:08.133 --> 00:07:14.067
So it didn't make its way into
American literature, exactly.

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:17.167
But it's interesting in many
ways, because it is Zelda

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:22.500
using her own medical history,
using her marriage to Scott

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.733
Fitzgerald, using all that
personal stuff as material for

00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:30.100
this novel.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.633
And Fitzgerald actually tried
to stop it from being

00:07:34.633 --> 00:07:38.733
published or tried to revise it
very significantly before

00:07:38.733 --> 00:07:40.533
it was published.

00:07:40.533 --> 00:07:43.600
And then after it was published,
he had this opinion

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.433
about his wife's novel.

00:07:45.433 --> 00:07:48.333
"Plagiaristic, unwise
in every way.

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:51.000
Should not have been
written. "

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.733
So this is, in may ways, a kind
of a long painful example

00:07:56.733 --> 00:08:02.067
of the many, many instances in
American literature of the

00:08:02.067 --> 00:08:05.600
husband having some control
over the wife's writing.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.867
The most famous example is Ted
Hughes and Sylvia Plath.

00:08:08.867 --> 00:08:14.000
Her letters were actually edited
by him after her death.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.533
So in this case, she did
get it published.

00:08:16.533 --> 00:08:19.500
But it didn't reach a very
wide audience, and he was

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.200
against it from day one.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.100
The daughter, Scottie, had a
somewhat different opinion.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.700
She just said that "this
sort of competition is

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:34.367
traditionally the bane of
literary romances." So at

00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:37.933
least she had a very clear-eyed
view about the

00:08:37.933 --> 00:08:41.533
marriage that there was quite
a competition going on.

00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:44.900
Even though, obviously, he was
the one who was the writer.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.367
she had some aspirations
as well.

00:08:47.367 --> 00:08:49.833
And if she had been encouraged,
might actually

00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:52.767
have had more of a career.

00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:56.833
So the element of competition
between husband and wife I

00:08:56.833 --> 00:08:58.800
think is quite an
important theme.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.033
Even though Fitzgerald tried to
downplay it in saying that

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:05.733
his wife's the one who really
had no talent, she had to

00:09:05.733 --> 00:09:09.100
plagiarize from him, he must
have registered the fact that

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.833
she was more of a competitor
than he let on.

00:09:12.833 --> 00:09:16.067
So we'll see how that plays out
in the dynamics between

00:09:16.067 --> 00:09:21.333
Dick Diver and Nicole
and who wins out.

00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:25.333
This is actually not so
important, but just a kind of

00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:29.000
point of reference is we know
there's another woman,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.600
significant woman in Tender
is the Night,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.900
Rosemary, the actress.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.967
And I think this is generally
thought that this is the

00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:40.333
person that Rosemary
is based on.

00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:41.800
And we can sort of see that.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.767
She has this very wholesome,
innocent look.

00:09:44.767 --> 00:09:49.167
But she also was tremendously
disciplined as an actress.

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:50.867
And indeed, she had a
very distinguished

00:09:50.867 --> 00:09:52.700
career as an actress.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:58.067
So this is sort of the Hollywood
contribution to

00:09:58.067 --> 00:09:59.333
Tender Is the Night.

00:10:04.433 --> 00:10:06.933
Today's lecture actually will
be more about cinematic

00:10:06.933 --> 00:10:08.067
techniques.

00:10:08.067 --> 00:10:12.967
So even though she personifies
Hollywood's contribution to

00:10:12.967 --> 00:10:16.367
Tender Is the Night, actually
it's in terms of formal

00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:20.133
techniques that film would have
more of an input on the

00:10:20.133 --> 00:10:23.133
narrative technique of
Tender Is the Night.

00:10:23.133 --> 00:10:27.733
But I want to go back very
briefly to something that

00:10:27.733 --> 00:10:31.533
we've been talking about all
semester, which is the very

00:10:31.533 --> 00:10:37.167
important, and in many ways,
variously played out dynamics

00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:41.967
between the "have" and the "have
not." So I know you guys

00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:45.467
might not have gotten to the
end of this novel, so I

00:10:45.467 --> 00:10:49.433
apologize, but there's really no
way I could talk about the

00:10:49.433 --> 00:10:52.500
novel without talking
about the ending.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.800
So without knowing all the
details in between, this is

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.400
the last two paragraphs of
Tender is the Night.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.867
"...but he became entangled with
a girl who worked in a

00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:12.033
grocery store, and he was also
involved in a lawsuit about

00:11:12.033 --> 00:11:16.000
some medical question;
so he left Lockport.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.600
After that he didn't ask for
the children to be sent to

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.633
America and didn't answer when
Nicole wrote asking him if he

00:11:23.633 --> 00:11:25.200
needed money.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.400
In the last letter she had from
him he told her that he

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.000
was practising in Geneva, New
York, and she got the

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.367
impression that he had settled
down with some one to keep

00:11:34.367 --> 00:11:35.733
house for him.

00:11:35.733 --> 00:11:39.300
She looked up Geneva in an atlas
and found it was in the

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.600
heart of the Finger Lakes
Section and considered a

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.067
pleasant place.

00:11:44.067 --> 00:11:46.833
Perhaps, so she liked to think,
his career was biding

00:11:46.833 --> 00:11:51.367
its time again like Grant's in
Galena; his latest note was

00:11:51.367 --> 00:11:55.700
post-marked from Hornell, New
York, which is some distance

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.600
from Geneva and a very small
town; in any case he is almost

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.233
certainly in that section of
the country, in one town or

00:12:05.233 --> 00:12:06.767
another."

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:12.233
So those last five words, five
of the cruelest words in

00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:14.100
American literature.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.133
He's a total nobody by
the end of the novel,

00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:21.333
in one town or another.

00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:28.200
So this is a novel that moves
very fast. We start out with

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.633
him at the top of his
profession, full of promise.

00:12:33.633 --> 00:12:36.767
In fact, when we first see
him, he is idolized by

00:12:36.767 --> 00:12:39.800
everyone around him.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:45.067
To get there to this ending
that the woman in his life

00:12:45.067 --> 00:12:47.633
would be someone that he sees
in a grocery store--

00:12:47.633 --> 00:12:51.933
and not even that, getting
into trouble of his very

00:12:51.933 --> 00:12:55.367
modest medical practice.

00:12:55.367 --> 00:12:59.367
A drifter, going from one
small town to another.

00:12:59.367 --> 00:13:04.100
And this additional insult that
he starts out in Zurich,

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.100
Switzerland --

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.600
a city that everyone
knows about --

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.133
to Geneva, New York, which
Nicole has to look up in an

00:13:13.133 --> 00:13:17.500
atlas, and he can't even
hold onto this Geneva.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.800
So it is, in many ways, the
ending is the beginning, but a

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.833
highly ironized beginning.

00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:29.133
We've seen this structure
before, and I promise you

00:13:29.133 --> 00:13:32.167
we'll see it one more time.

00:13:32.167 --> 00:13:35.500
So the last three novelists that
we read basically have

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.800
the same structure, but to
totally different effect.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.233
So from what we know at this
point, we know that at least

00:13:43.233 --> 00:13:45.800
one other novel has this
circular structure-- the

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.300
ending is the beginning--

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.600
which is For Whom
the Bell Tolls.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.633
So we've talked about this,
but just want to give you

00:13:50.633 --> 00:13:52.433
those two sentences.

00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:56.833
Beginning, "He lay flat on the
brown, pine-needled floor of

00:13:56.833 --> 00:14:00.533
the forest." And then the last
line, "He could feel his heart

00:14:00.533 --> 00:14:03.100
beating against the pine-needled
floor of the

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.400
forest."

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:10.867
So it is Hemingway's very tender
rendition of a life

00:14:10.867 --> 00:14:14.800
that could be construed as the
life of a "have not." We

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.900
talked about that possibility
that maybe

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.567
he really has nothing.

00:14:18.567 --> 00:14:21.967
All he has is a broken leg,
that very ironic reading,

00:14:21.967 --> 00:14:24.067
which is not to be dismissed.

00:14:24.067 --> 00:14:28.133
But against that ironic reading,
Hemingway invokes

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:35.600
this very lyrical image of
ending is the beginning as a

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.267
kind of an endless deferral
of the moment of death.

00:14:40.267 --> 00:14:41.533
So he's still alive.

00:14:41.533 --> 00:14:44.367
It's almost as if we're
beginning all over again.

00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:47.733
And we, as the readers, want him
to begin all over again.

00:14:47.733 --> 00:14:50.967
It is that illusion perpetrated
in our minds, the

00:14:50.967 --> 00:14:56.533
reader's mind, that Hemingway is
able to write a novel that,

00:14:56.533 --> 00:14:59.067
in some sense, doesn't really
have an ending.

00:14:59.067 --> 00:15:03.733
In the ending is the beginning,
the actual death

00:15:03.733 --> 00:15:06.933
scene is deferred to a
point of infinity.

00:15:06.933 --> 00:15:12.433
So this is Hemingway's very
tender wrapping up of the life

00:15:12.433 --> 00:15:16.233
of Robert Jordan in For
Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:15:16.233 --> 00:15:21.067
And in contrast to that,
Fitzgerald is about as

00:15:21.067 --> 00:15:22.667
brutal as can be.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:33.933
Actually, it's sort of
surprising that he would want

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:37.933
to be so thoroughgoing in the
degradation of Dick Diver.

00:15:37.933 --> 00:15:40.967
But that's how he
wants to write.

00:15:40.967 --> 00:15:46.733
So today we'll look at that
ending, the cruelty of that.

00:15:46.733 --> 00:15:51.200
And link that to the question
of narrative speed.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.300
We know that the novel is moving
very fast. A lot of

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.633
things have to happen for us to
get to that very, very low

00:15:58.633 --> 00:16:01.300
point at the end of the novel.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:06.967
So what has happened and what
does Fitzgerald have to do in

00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:09.800
order to speed up the narrative
to such an extent

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.133
that he would get to that
absolute low point?

00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:16.333
So last time, we talked about
montage and we talked about

00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:20.667
flashback as two cinematic
techniques that are important

00:16:20.667 --> 00:16:21.900
to Fitzgerald.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:27.200
And today, we'll look at three
very, very common filming

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.867
techniques and the way that they
actually help to speed up

00:16:30.867 --> 00:16:32.333
the narrative.

00:16:32.333 --> 00:16:36.600
It's not self-evident that a
close-up would, in fact, speed

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.300
up the narrative.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.933
But the way Fitzgerald uses his
close-ups actually does.

00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:45.100
And it's not always clear that
cross-cutting would speed up

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.400
the narrative.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:49.367
Once again, he uses this very
familiar technique to move

00:16:49.367 --> 00:16:50.600
things forward.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.833
And then we have the very fast
motion of the negative

00:16:55.833 --> 00:16:56.800
resolutions.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.267
Things being taken away
from Dick Diver.

00:17:01.267 --> 00:17:06.100
So let's look at a couple of
instances of close-up.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:12.433
And this is just so obviously
visual that it's sort of hard

00:17:12.433 --> 00:17:15.733
to look away from that with
how to read this without

00:17:15.733 --> 00:17:17.800
having some kind of
visual image.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.233
This is about Rosemary.

00:17:20.233 --> 00:17:24.033
As you know, she has this crush
on him, on Dick Diver,

00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:29.833
and really desperately wants
to have an affair.

00:17:29.833 --> 00:17:32.533
But it doesn't quite
happen for a while.

00:17:32.533 --> 00:17:36.033
"Presently she kissed him
several times in the mouth,

00:17:36.033 --> 00:17:39.633
her face getting big as it came
up to him; he had never

00:17:39.633 --> 00:17:43.867
seen anything so dazzling as the
quality of her skin, and

00:17:43.867 --> 00:17:47.833
since sometimes beauty gives
back the images of one's best

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:52.400
thoughts he thought of his
responsibility about Nicole,

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.600
and about the responsibility
of her being two doors down

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.533
across the corridor.

00:17:58.533 --> 00:18:00.767
'The rain's over,' he said.
'Do you see the sun on the

00:18:00.767 --> 00:18:06.467
slate?' Rosemary stood up and
leaned down and said her most

00:18:06.467 --> 00:18:08.200
sincere thing to him.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.933
'Oh, we're such actors --

00:18:09.933 --> 00:18:13.700
you and I.'

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:20.100
OK, so we're starting out
on one kind of register.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.900
We're starting with the notion
of Rosemary as this kind of

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:30.867
lovesick puppy that's
just pining for him.

00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:36.533
And unrequited love on top of
that, that is going nowhere.

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:42.533
And so the first part up to the
last three lines of that

00:18:42.533 --> 00:18:48.400
passage is really all about Dick
Diver being this noble

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.633
person, even though he could
have taken advantage of

00:18:50.633 --> 00:18:52.367
Rosemary and she's
pining for him.

00:18:52.367 --> 00:18:54.500
He could have easily taken
advantage of her.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.200
He's not doing that.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.500
He's thinking of his
responsibility to Nicole two

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.000
doors down the hall.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.033
All that is really about the
nobility and anonymity and

00:19:04.033 --> 00:19:06.800
uprightness of Dick Diver.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:14.433
The last three lines swing us
to the other end, other side

00:19:14.433 --> 00:19:15.600
of the narrative.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.500
And all of a sudden, we
see what kind of a

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.400
person Rosemary is.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.133
And she's completely truthful.

00:19:23.133 --> 00:19:26.733
Rosemary's never not truthful.

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:29.733
Even though she's an actress,
she actually is the most

00:19:29.733 --> 00:19:33.433
truthful person in the novel.

00:19:33.433 --> 00:19:37.967
And this is an absolute
statement that is completely

00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:39.433
right about both of them.

00:19:39.433 --> 00:19:41.200
She is an actress.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:51.933
So it's very hard to know where
the acting ends and

00:19:51.933 --> 00:19:53.400
where the feeling begins.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.767
She's so disciplined that she
would act in a certain way.

00:19:56.767 --> 00:20:00.433
And then she runs into an
obstacle, and she stops acting

00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:02.300
in that way as she was
doing right there.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.433
It's like trying out one route,
seeing that is going

00:20:05.433 --> 00:20:07.933
nowhere, and then suddenly
seeing that maybe she should

00:20:07.933 --> 00:20:10.167
act in a different fashion.

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:16.567
So there is a way in which the
emotional life of Rosemary has

00:20:16.567 --> 00:20:19.733
been completely professionalized
to such an

00:20:19.733 --> 00:20:24.000
extent that she's always acting,
which is not even to

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.867
say that she's not sincere.

00:20:26.867 --> 00:20:30.500
And Fitzgerald credits her
with being sincere.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.100
It's just that that
is what she is.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.367
I don't think that she is
capable of having any kind of

00:20:36.367 --> 00:20:39.633
emotions outside of
her professional

00:20:39.633 --> 00:20:42.000
identity as an actress.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.133
So this is what she is.

00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:52.967
So it is Dick's blindness to
that that he doesn't realize

00:20:52.967 --> 00:20:58.067
that she's not exactly
a love-sick puppy.

00:20:58.067 --> 00:21:01.567
She is someone who is
actually acting in

00:21:01.567 --> 00:21:04.100
a particular fashion.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.000
And who not only has a full
understanding of what kind of

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.767
a person she is, but
she has a full

00:21:11.767 --> 00:21:14.167
understanding of what he is.

00:21:14.167 --> 00:21:18.200
So it's not surprising that she
should know herself to be

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.200
primarily an actress.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.267
It's not an accusation
to say that.

00:21:23.267 --> 00:21:24.767
That's what she is.

00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:28.200
Above everything else, she's
primarily an actress.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.300
So she has that degree
of self-knowledge.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.833
But she also has the knowledge
about him, that even though he

00:21:34.833 --> 00:21:39.433
is supposedly a doctor,
he actually is,

00:21:39.433 --> 00:21:42.367
at heart, an actor.

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:46.567
And that is an accusation, a
much more serious accusation,

00:21:46.567 --> 00:21:49.933
directed at him than it is
directed at her, because she

00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:53.267
has been totally up front.

00:21:53.267 --> 00:21:55.200
She never is not an actress.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.167
From the beginning of the
novel to the end, she is

00:21:58.167 --> 00:21:59.667
defined by that.

00:21:59.667 --> 00:22:01.700
He is supposed to be a doctor.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.733
So he's not supposed
to be an actor.

00:22:03.733 --> 00:22:07.600
But it turns out that maybe the
innermost truth about him

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.200
is that he is an actor.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:16.400
And that all the appearance of
nobility, all the appearance

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.600
of uprightness, might turn out
to be an act that he is

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.767
putting up for her benefit.

00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:26.900
An act that he's putting
up for his own benefit.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.567
Sometimes we can act for
ourselves as well.

00:22:30.567 --> 00:22:34.300
So it shows the degree of
knowledge of him and a

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:40.067
clear-eyed, unsentimental,
unlove-sick evaluation of

00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:43.133
exactly what kind
of a man he is.

00:22:43.133 --> 00:22:47.367
So it is the most acute
statement about Dick Diver

00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:48.967
that we've seen up
to this point.

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:51.367
This is quite early, page 105.

00:22:51.367 --> 00:22:56.633
So it is that acuteness, that
astute knowledge about a man

00:22:56.633 --> 00:23:01.167
that she's supposedly idolizing
that gives the lie,

00:23:01.167 --> 00:23:04.900
actually, to the adoration
that she seems to

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.433
be raining on him.

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:09.933
That it's actually completely
within bounds.

00:23:09.933 --> 00:23:15.367
She's practicing what it's
like to be an adoring,

00:23:15.367 --> 00:23:16.200
love-sick puppy.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.733
She's acting that part.

00:23:17.733 --> 00:23:23.000
But it's a part that she's
just doing it very well.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.633
So just to move this to analysis
of the narrative

00:23:28.633 --> 00:23:37.367
technique, the moment when we
have that kind of sudden

00:23:37.367 --> 00:23:43.233
switch in perspective actually
comes with a visual detail

00:23:43.233 --> 00:23:47.433
that her face is coming closer
and closer to him.

00:23:47.433 --> 00:23:50.833
And her face is getting big
as it comes up to him.

00:23:50.833 --> 00:23:54.833
So let's remember that one
visual detail that her face

00:23:54.833 --> 00:24:01.700
completely fills his field of
vision, that he sees nothing

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.733
but her face.

00:24:02.733 --> 00:24:06.533
So let's keep that one visual
detail in mind and see what

00:24:06.533 --> 00:24:09.867
Fitzgerald does with that
detail, that close-up.

00:24:09.867 --> 00:24:13.733
So this is another scene
quite a bit later--

00:24:13.733 --> 00:24:15.100
actually a flashback.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.533
So going back to the point when
Nicole was still in the

00:24:18.533 --> 00:24:22.967
sanatorium and she was asking
him to take care of her.

00:24:22.967 --> 00:24:26.233
"Nicole was up in her head now,
cool as cool, trying to

00:24:26.233 --> 00:24:29.633
collate the sentimentalities
of her childhood, as

00:24:29.633 --> 00:24:33.533
deliberate as a man getting
drunk after battle...

00:24:33.533 --> 00:24:37.433
He breathed over her shoulder
and turned her insistently

00:24:37.433 --> 00:24:42.400
about; she kissed him several
times, her face getting big

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.633
every time he came
close, her hands

00:24:44.633 --> 00:24:47.033
holding him by the shoulders.

00:24:47.033 --> 00:24:50.900
'It's raining hard.' Suddenly
there was a booming from the

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:57.867
wine slopes across the lake;
cannons were shooting at

00:24:57.867 --> 00:25:01.000
hail-bearing clouds in
order to break them.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.900
The lights of the promenade
went off, went on again.'

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:12.000
So we get that repetition of
that same visual detail--

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.633
the kissing, her face getting
very big as it

00:25:16.633 --> 00:25:17.500
gets close to him.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.900
So the repetition of
the same close-up.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:25.167
And what is odd is that we get
exactly the same narrative

00:25:25.167 --> 00:25:28.000
sequence after that close-up.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.033
After the visual detail of her
face getting big, we get the

00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:37.833
exact switch to a different
narrative register.

00:25:37.833 --> 00:25:42.700
So this is not Nicole passing
judgment on him.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.033
So it's not exactly the
same structure as the

00:25:47.033 --> 00:25:49.167
incident with Rosemary.

00:25:49.167 --> 00:25:53.233
But there's a switch, abrupt
switch, to a different

00:25:53.233 --> 00:25:54.733
sequence of narrative.

00:25:54.733 --> 00:25:58.867
In this case, it's such
quite a trivial event.

00:25:58.867 --> 00:26:02.100
They were shooting cannons
in order to break up the

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.833
hail-bearing clouds.

00:26:03.833 --> 00:26:06.567
I guess it's something you
do in Switzerland.

00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:14.867
But the point is that cannons
were being fired in peacetime

00:26:14.867 --> 00:26:19.067
Switzerland, which is kind of
a surprising fact in itself

00:26:19.067 --> 00:26:22.033
since we're not so familiar with
cannons being fired for

00:26:22.033 --> 00:26:23.367
that purpose.

00:26:23.367 --> 00:26:28.200
But given the fact that we'll be
seeing the intertwined, the

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:34.200
superimposed images of love
and war, the firing of the

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.000
cannons is certainly not
trivial at this point.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.233
So at the very least, we can say
that there's an intrusion

00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:50.967
into this love scene of the
undeniable and historical

00:26:50.967 --> 00:26:56.700
proven reality of war, of World
War I. It's just a fact

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.200
of history that there
was such a war.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.600
So Fitzgerald's not going to
recreate that war for us,

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.633
except for going over the
battleground and talking about

00:27:06.633 --> 00:27:10.400
it taking 20 lives to
advance a foot--

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.800
that reference that
we saw last time.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.300
He's not going to go further in
the direction of World War

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.867
I than he has done so far.

00:27:17.867 --> 00:27:22.800
But he is going to give us
echoes of World War I in

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.667
civilian situations.

00:27:24.667 --> 00:27:28.633
And not only that, but he's
going to use that as a

00:27:28.633 --> 00:27:34.167
narrative follow up to a love
scene, specifically to a

00:27:34.167 --> 00:27:38.633
close-up when the woman's face
is getting bigger and bigger.

00:27:38.633 --> 00:27:42.233
So we can say that what the
close-up is doing for

00:27:42.233 --> 00:27:44.500
Fitzgerald--

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.967
especially the woman's face
getting bigger and bigger--

00:27:46.967 --> 00:27:51.867
is the dramatization, the
visualization of the woman's

00:27:51.867 --> 00:27:54.500
power over the man.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.233
So when Rosemary's face is
getting so big that she fills

00:27:58.233 --> 00:28:02.767
the entire visual tableau, that
is the point where we see

00:28:02.767 --> 00:28:05.933
that Rosemary actually knows
exactly what kind of a man

00:28:05.933 --> 00:28:07.300
Dick Diver is.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.567
That's she's is absolutely
clear-eyed about him.

00:28:10.567 --> 00:28:13.567
Here there's not that equivalent
clear-eyed

00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:15.733
judgement from the part
of Nicole because

00:28:15.733 --> 00:28:16.933
she's still a patient.

00:28:16.933 --> 00:28:19.267
She hasn't gotten to
that point yet.

00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:24.167
But Fitzgerald is giving us the
structural equivalent of

00:28:24.167 --> 00:28:26.067
that kind of judgment in the
sense that there's a sudden

00:28:26.067 --> 00:28:30.433
break up of the love scene and
the replacement of that love

00:28:30.433 --> 00:28:34.400
scene by something that is like
an intonation of battle.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.067
So at the very least, we should
be prepared for the

00:28:37.067 --> 00:28:41.800
fact that maybe war is not
extraneous to love.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.633
Maybe war is actually
organic to love.

00:28:44.633 --> 00:28:48.733
That maybe war is the narrative
structure of love.

00:28:48.733 --> 00:28:53.133
That love takes the form of a
battle between the two people

00:28:53.133 --> 00:28:56.267
who are conjoined
in this fashion.

00:28:56.267 --> 00:29:03.333
So this is, in many ways, a kind
of a prelude to a kind of

00:29:03.333 --> 00:29:08.667
visual tableau that is a gesture
towards the future of

00:29:08.667 --> 00:29:10.433
that narrative.

00:29:10.433 --> 00:29:15.533
But I want to look at another
technique now, which is also

00:29:15.533 --> 00:29:21.333
very prominent and very
unmistakable in Tender Is the

00:29:21.333 --> 00:29:24.333
Night, which is the technique
of cross-cutting.

00:29:24.333 --> 00:29:28.933
So this is in book 2 of Tender
Is the Night, and especially

00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:32.400
in section 10 of book 2.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.300
So it's the beginning
of section 10.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:40.867
Begins with, "In Zurich in
September Doctor Diver had tea

00:29:40.867 --> 00:29:41.933
with Baby Warren."

00:29:41.933 --> 00:29:45.767
So at this point, he's
still a doctor.

00:29:45.767 --> 00:29:49.367
And it's in that professional
capacity that he would have

00:29:49.367 --> 00:29:54.900
tea with Baby Warren, Nicole's
sister, who's trying to get a

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.267
doctor to take of her.

00:29:56.267 --> 00:29:58.933
Buy a doctor for Nicole.

00:29:58.933 --> 00:30:02.067
So they're having tea and
talking about various things.

00:30:02.067 --> 00:30:06.900
And he's still not agreeing to
being a lifelong caretaker for

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.600
Nicole at this point.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:14.067
But this is what happens on
page 158, one page down.

00:30:14.067 --> 00:30:15.633
Next page, actually.

00:30:15.633 --> 00:30:20.067
We get a sudden, abrupt switch
to Nicole's point of view,

00:30:20.067 --> 00:30:25.333
told from her point of view, and
narrated by Nicole herself

00:30:25.333 --> 00:30:28.767
as in the first person.

00:30:28.767 --> 00:30:33.500
This is outside of her exchange
of the letters that

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.667
she writes to Dick Diver.

00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:39.633
We'll get a sense of how Nicole
thinks by following

00:30:39.633 --> 00:30:45.433
this kind of monologue that is
given to us as counterpoint to

00:30:45.433 --> 00:30:48.700
the tea between Dick Diver
and Baby Warren.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.133
"How do you do, lawyer.

00:30:50.133 --> 00:30:52.667
We're going to Como tomorrow
for a week and

00:30:52.667 --> 00:30:54.333
then back to Zurich.

00:30:54.333 --> 00:30:57.700
That's why I wanted you and
sister to settle this, because

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.433
it doesn't matter to us
how much I'm allowed.

00:31:00.433 --> 00:31:03.100
We're going to live very quietly
in Zurich for two

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.667
years and Dick has enough
to take care of us.

00:31:06.667 --> 00:31:09.700
No, Baby, I'm more practical
than you think--

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.367
It's only for clothes and
things I'll need it...

00:31:12.367 --> 00:31:15.133
Why, that's more than--

00:31:15.133 --> 00:31:18.000
can the estate really afford
to give me all that?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.533
I know I'll never manage
to spend it.

00:31:20.533 --> 00:31:23.200
Do you have that much?

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.467
Why do you have more--

00:31:24.467 --> 00:31:27.233
is it because I'm supposed
to be incompetent?

00:31:27.233 --> 00:31:28.133
All right.

00:31:28.133 --> 00:31:30.133
Let my share pile up then...

00:31:30.133 --> 00:31:32.767
No, Dick refuses to
have anything

00:31:32.767 --> 00:31:34.533
whatever to do with it.

00:31:34.533 --> 00:31:37.800
I'll have to feel bloated
for us both..."

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.900
I'm not even reading
it very well.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:44.400
This could have been read much
better to get the tone exactly

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:49.133
what a sharp businesswoman
Nicole is.

00:31:49.133 --> 00:31:54.233
In the space of one
short exchange she

00:31:54.233 --> 00:31:56.800
achieves three things.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.567
She manages to get her
share of the estate.

00:32:00.567 --> 00:32:05.000
So she begins with saying, OK,
we can live very modestly on

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.667
Dick's pay.

00:32:05.667 --> 00:32:06.467
We don't need the money.

00:32:06.467 --> 00:32:09.067
I just need it for clothes
and incidentals.

00:32:09.067 --> 00:32:12.200
So very modest requirement,
very modest

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.900
demand on the estate.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.033
She gets the amount she
says is too much.

00:32:18.033 --> 00:32:22.100
She checks out to see how much
Baby is getting and finds out

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.033
that, in fact, what she's
getting is less

00:32:24.033 --> 00:32:25.967
than what Baby gets.

00:32:25.967 --> 00:32:30.633
So she gets an increase right
then and there on the spot.

00:32:30.633 --> 00:32:34.600
More than that, there's, of
course, the question whether

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.333
Dick will have a share
of that income.

00:32:39.333 --> 00:32:42.733
And she's admitting to the fact
that she would have to

00:32:42.733 --> 00:32:46.200
feel bloated for the two of
them, that he's not going to

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.533
get a penny of that income.

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:54.267
So in the space of one paragraph
that switch from

00:32:54.267 --> 00:32:57.767
Dick's point of view to Nicole's
point of view is, in

00:32:57.767 --> 00:33:02.833
fact, an incredible fast forward
of the narrative,

00:33:02.833 --> 00:33:08.700
changing our conception of
Nicole from a patient in a

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:15.267
mental institution to a sharp
business woman who is going to

00:33:15.267 --> 00:33:19.833
keep very, very tight control
over the money

00:33:19.833 --> 00:33:21.767
that comes to her.

00:33:21.767 --> 00:33:24.667
That we shouldn't forget,
after all, she's the

00:33:24.667 --> 00:33:30.700
granddaughter of a man who has
a huge fortune, who has made

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.933
that huge fortune.

00:33:31.933 --> 00:33:35.500
And there's a constant
reference, as in For Whom the

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.400
Bell Tolls, the cross-generation
link to the

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.267
grandfather.

00:33:40.267 --> 00:33:44.233
In Tender is the Night,
there's also a

00:33:44.233 --> 00:33:46.433
cross-generational link to
Nicole's grandfather.

00:33:46.433 --> 00:33:50.700
That maybe she's more her
grandfather's granddaughter

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.900
than we may think.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.433
So the effect of that
cross-cutting is to take the

00:33:55.433 --> 00:34:01.800
narrative away from Dick's side
of the story and deposit

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.367
the agency strictly
on Nicole's side.

00:34:05.367 --> 00:34:08.233
That she's the one who's
actually calling the shots.

00:34:08.233 --> 00:34:12.833
She's the one who actually has
the financial control over the

00:34:12.833 --> 00:34:14.100
future of that marriage.

00:34:16.667 --> 00:34:22.267
Let me just give you one other
much more small incidence of

00:34:22.267 --> 00:34:23.933
that cross-cutting.

00:34:23.933 --> 00:34:28.733
All this, the many pages after
that cross-cutting, is told in

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:32.067
the first person in
Nicole's voice.

00:34:32.067 --> 00:34:35.200
And so from being in a mental
institution, suddenly she's

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.833
married to Dick Diver.

00:34:37.833 --> 00:34:39.033
All of that is settled.

00:34:39.033 --> 00:34:41.833
She has the control
over the money.

00:34:41.833 --> 00:34:47.700
But she also is beginning to
complain about the particular

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.367
shape the marriage is taking.

00:34:50.367 --> 00:34:53.200
"But I was gone again by that
time-- trains and beaches they

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.400
were all one.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.067
That was why he took me
travelling but after my second

00:34:58.067 --> 00:35:01.967
child, my little girl,
Topsy, was born

00:35:01.967 --> 00:35:04.733
everything got dark again....

00:35:04.733 --> 00:35:08.900
If I could get word to my
husband who has seen fit to

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:14.467
desert me here, to leave me in
the hands of incompetents.

00:35:14.467 --> 00:35:17.333
You tell me my baby is black--

00:35:17.333 --> 00:35:21.233
that's farcical, that's
very cheap.

00:35:21.233 --> 00:35:24.933
We went to Africa merely to see
Timgad, since my principal

00:35:24.933 --> 00:35:28.167
interest in life
is archaeology.

00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:32.433
I am tired of knowing nothing
and being reminded of it all

00:35:32.433 --> 00:35:33.400
the time."

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.833
So page 161.

00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:40.100
We can see the speed of this
development, of that

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.500
particular interpretation
of the marriage.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.900
From the beginning, when she's
not even married to Dick

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:53.200
Diver, to the next page, 159,
when she's married to him, but

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.467
retaining full control of her
finances, to page 161 when

00:35:58.467 --> 00:36:02.100
she's in a position to
complain about his

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.100
behavior as a husband.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.200
And what is odd here--

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.800
and I think it's actually quite
heavy handed on the part

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.433
of Fitzgerald-- is that, once
again, there's a gratuitous,

00:36:13.433 --> 00:36:18.233
completely inexplicable
intrusion of a racialized

00:36:18.233 --> 00:36:24.533
detail in the person of Nicole's
daughter, Topsy.

00:36:24.533 --> 00:36:28.333
That "my baby is black" is
really coming out of nowhere,

00:36:28.333 --> 00:36:30.967
except for the fact that we
know that Fitzgerald has a

00:36:30.967 --> 00:36:35.000
long history of racializing
particular characters at

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
critical moments.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.733
And you guys know that Topsy is
a reference to Uncle Tom's

00:36:41.733 --> 00:36:44.767
Cabin, to Harriet Beecher
Stowe's novel.

00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:48.733
And Topsy's a black character,
and it's one of the most vivid

00:36:48.733 --> 00:36:50.367
black characters
in that novel.

00:36:50.367 --> 00:36:53.600
So it's Fitzgerald's kind of
backhanded tribute to a

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.267
nineteenth century classic and
resurrecting the name of a

00:36:57.267 --> 00:36:58.833
black character.

00:36:58.833 --> 00:37:03.400
Totally inappropriate name for
the daughter of Nicole.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.100
But nonetheless, that's what
he chooses to give her.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:12.633
So this is just to flesh out the
features of the history of

00:37:12.633 --> 00:37:16.367
racialization in Fitzgerald.

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:19.200
We know that there really are
no black characters in The

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.000
Great Gatsby.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.067
But there's this constant
intrusion of

00:37:23.067 --> 00:37:25.500
black characters, strangely.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.433
"As we crossed Blackwell's
island a limousine passed us,

00:37:28.433 --> 00:37:31.800
driven by a white chauffeur,
in which sat three modish

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.867
negroes, two bucks and a girl.

00:37:32.867 --> 00:37:35.700
I laughed aloud as the yolks
of their eyeballs rolled

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.367
toward us in haughty rivalry."

00:37:37.367 --> 00:37:41.067
So this is Gatsby going
to town with Nick.

00:37:41.067 --> 00:37:45.233
And all of a sudden, the
intrusion of the three blacks

00:37:45.233 --> 00:37:48.900
in a limousine driven by a white
chauffeur, that is a

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:54.833
kind of visual metaphor for the
upstart Gatsby trying to

00:37:54.833 --> 00:37:58.867
elevate himself higher
than he should be.

00:37:58.867 --> 00:38:03.933
In this case, the racialization
that we see in

00:38:03.933 --> 00:38:09.300
Tender is the Night has to do,
I think, with a moment of

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.433
marital volatility.

00:38:12.433 --> 00:38:17.567
We know that she actually
has control of the basic

00:38:17.567 --> 00:38:22.100
structural feature of that
marriage, which is the money.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:29.133
And given that control, she's
in a position to put a

00:38:29.133 --> 00:38:32.200
particular spin on
that marriage.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.200
And the marriage has to do with
neglect, with the fact

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:41.533
that they're traveling because
he needs to travel, that she's

00:38:41.533 --> 00:38:48.067
an involuntary appendage to his
constant travel, and that

00:38:48.067 --> 00:38:49.133
he's neglecting her.

00:38:49.133 --> 00:38:54.067
So this is, in many ways, a
very early paving of the

00:38:54.067 --> 00:38:59.233
ground for the eventual outcome
of the novel, that is

00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:05.133
highlighted by Nicole presenting
herself as the

00:39:05.133 --> 00:39:09.400
victimized party in
the marriage.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:15.200
So to racialize herself and to
racialize her daughter is a

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:21.267
very specific and I guess
tested technique of

00:39:21.267 --> 00:39:25.933
demonstration a degree of
grievance, a degree of felt

00:39:25.933 --> 00:39:27.733
oppression on her part.

00:39:27.733 --> 00:39:32.567
Even though she's not really
black, it's almost as if she

00:39:32.567 --> 00:39:36.100
were the black person
in that marriage.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:39.300
So that's what the metaphor
is doing for her.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.033
She's anything but black.

00:39:41.033 --> 00:39:44.300
But she's treated as
if she were black.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.200
That's what she's claiming.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.667
So we don't really know if
we agree with her yet.

00:39:49.667 --> 00:39:53.933
But this is Nicole's
interpretation of the marriage

00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:57.400
is that she is the oppressed
party in that marriage.

00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:05.633
So let's look at one
other instance of

00:40:05.633 --> 00:40:08.100
cross-cutting to Nicole.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:12.000
And this is, once again, taking
the narrative agency--

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.733
at least landing the story
on Nicole's side.

00:40:16.733 --> 00:40:23.967
"Dick, why did you register Mr.
and Mrs. Diver instead of

00:40:23.967 --> 00:40:26.367
Doctor and Mrs. Diver?

00:40:26.367 --> 00:40:27.367
I just wondered--

00:40:27.367 --> 00:40:29.500
it just floated through
my mind. --

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.100
You've taught me that work is
everything and I believe you.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.400
You used to say a man knows
things and when he stops

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.600
knowing things he's like anybody
else, and the thing is

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:44.967
to get power before he
stops knowing things.

00:40:44.967 --> 00:40:48.867
If you want to turn topsy-turvy,
all right, but

00:40:48.867 --> 00:40:52.733
must your Nicole follow you
walking on her hands,

00:40:52.733 --> 00:40:54.967
darling?"

00:40:54.967 --> 00:41:00.600
So I think that by page 162,
one page further down, the

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.933
shape of what is to come is
pretty much unmistakable.

00:41:04.933 --> 00:41:10.500
And it is conveyed very much
through a tone of voice.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:15.733
Through, in this case, almost
a repetition of exactly the

00:41:15.733 --> 00:41:18.467
same kind of structure
that we're seeing

00:41:18.467 --> 00:41:20.433
between Dick and Rosemary.

00:41:20.433 --> 00:41:24.433
Rosemary is the one, who on
page 105 already has seen

00:41:24.433 --> 00:41:26.833
through Dick Diver.

00:41:26.833 --> 00:41:30.967
She has seen through him so
that she can pass the most

00:41:30.967 --> 00:41:33.833
wounding judgment on
him that he's not

00:41:33.833 --> 00:41:37.333
doctor, he's an actor.

00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:44.267
Nicole has arrived at that
conclusion on page 162 that he

00:41:44.267 --> 00:41:45.500
is not a doctor.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.000
A doctor is supposed to have
medical knowledge.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.500
That's what makes a
medical doctor.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.200
A medical doctor is
that he has more

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.400
knowledge than his patient.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.800
But she knows at this point
that, in fact, he doesn't have

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.000
any more knowledge than the
average person, that he's lost

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.733
his claim to being a doctor.

00:42:06.733 --> 00:42:10.933
And so there are not that many
more identities available to

00:42:10.933 --> 00:42:15.467
him once he's lost that claim
to a professional identity.

00:42:15.467 --> 00:42:20.567
She's not saying outright that
he's an actor, but she's

00:42:20.567 --> 00:42:22.367
implying as much.

00:42:22.367 --> 00:42:26.100
And that added detail about
his well-being turned

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:31.100
topsy-turvy as well as the
naming the thing, that the

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:36.333
thing is to get power before
he stops knowing things.

00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:41.867
It is naming exactly what
it is that Dick Diver

00:42:41.867 --> 00:42:42.967
has failed to do.

00:42:42.967 --> 00:42:46.867
If he had done things right,
he would have had absolute

00:42:46.867 --> 00:42:50.767
control of the marriage before
he loses out in the department

00:42:50.767 --> 00:42:51.800
of knowledge.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.367
But now that he's lost out in
the department of knowledge,

00:42:55.367 --> 00:42:58.900
he's not going to have power
in that marriage as well.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:04.400
So the very sharp, clear-eyed,
absolutely unsentimental

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.433
judgment of her husband is
very much an echo of what

00:43:08.433 --> 00:43:11.800
Rosemary has intuited
much earlier.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.500
And it comes over to us, comes
across to the reader, once

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.933
again, through the technique
of cross-cutting.

00:43:17.933 --> 00:43:23.400
So I would say that this sort
of the emptying out of any

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.767
kind of sustenance, of any moral
sustenance in Dick Diver

00:43:27.767 --> 00:43:29.533
has come very, very early.

00:43:29.533 --> 00:43:33.733
And it's through this complete,
steady erosion of

00:43:33.733 --> 00:43:37.600
any admiration for him on the
part of two women who started

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.400
out as great idolizers of him.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.267
So now we've gotten to a point
where we actually see the

00:43:44.267 --> 00:43:47.500
speed of the negative resolution
picking up.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.400
The speed becomes just
faster and faster.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.200
Basically, there's three points
of no return for Dick

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:03.267
Diver on his way to losing his
medical practice in Rockport.

00:44:03.267 --> 00:44:07.133
The first point of no return
is the fight he gets with a

00:44:07.133 --> 00:44:08.900
carabinieri.

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:14.433
"He walked past the staring
carabinieri and up to the

00:44:14.433 --> 00:44:18.933
grinning face, hit it with a
smashing left beside the jaw.

00:44:18.933 --> 00:44:20.067
The man dropped to the floor."

00:44:20.067 --> 00:44:22.933
This is a cab driver that he
got into a fight with.

00:44:22.933 --> 00:44:25.667
"For a moment he stood over him
in triumph-- but even as

00:44:25.667 --> 00:44:29.000
the first pang of doubt shot
through him the world reeled;

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.733
he was clubbed down, and fists
and boots beat on him in a

00:44:32.733 --> 00:44:34.233
strange tattoo.

00:44:34.233 --> 00:44:38.400
He felt his nose break like a
shingle and his eyes jerk as

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.600
if they had snapped back on a
rubber band into his head.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.300
A rib splintered under
a stamping heel.

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.533
Momentarily he lost
consciousness, regained it as

00:44:48.533 --> 00:44:51.933
he was raised to a sitting
position and his wrists jerked

00:44:51.933 --> 00:44:53.867
together with handcuffs.

00:44:53.867 --> 00:44:57.267
The plainclothes lieutenant whom
he had knocked down...

00:44:57.267 --> 00:45:00.833
poised himself, drew back his
arm and smashed him to the

00:45:00.833 --> 00:45:02.300
floor."

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.633
This is a very brutal scene.

00:45:04.633 --> 00:45:05.900
Lots of people getting shot.

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:10.800
And Dick Diver, it's important
to point out, is not exempt

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.100
from that violence.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.500
And this is the first
emptying out of his

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.500
professional identity.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:22.300
That a doctor is supposed to
be treating someone who has

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:25.667
been subjected to that
kind of violence.

00:45:25.667 --> 00:45:28.033
And instead, it turns out that
he is the one who needs a

00:45:28.033 --> 00:45:30.533
doctor to take care of him.

00:45:30.533 --> 00:45:34.867
So this is what happens when you
have things happening very

00:45:34.867 --> 00:45:40.400
fast. And this is an image,
actually, of the carabenieri,

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.033
which still is kind of
sinister looking.

00:45:43.033 --> 00:45:45.300
But this is the person-- the
gang of them, actually--

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.233
beating up on Dick Diver.

00:45:48.233 --> 00:45:51.700
So what is interesting is that
even though things are

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:55.567
actually happening, raining down
fast, thick and fast on

00:45:55.567 --> 00:45:59.267
Dick Diver, he's actually
accused of moving too fast. We

00:45:59.267 --> 00:46:01.400
see that various people accuse
him of various things.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:05.100
We've seen Rosemary is accusing
him of something,

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.233
Nicole accusing him
of something.

00:46:07.233 --> 00:46:12.200
And he's now being accused by
his partner in a clinic in

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.600
this conversation between
Franz and his wife.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.967
"'For shame!' Kaethe said.

00:46:16.967 --> 00:46:18.700
'You're the solid one,
you do the work.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.800
It's a case or hare and tortoise
-- and in my opinion

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.467
the hare's race is
almost done'...

00:46:24.467 --> 00:46:27.733
Franz let himself believe with
ever-increasing conviction

00:46:27.733 --> 00:46:30.833
that Dick travelled
intellectually and emotionally

00:46:30.833 --> 00:46:34.233
at such a rate of speed that
the vibrations jarred him."

00:46:34.233 --> 00:46:37.033
So the two of them talking
behind his back, saying that

00:46:37.033 --> 00:46:39.800
he's not such a great partner
to begin with.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.933
And we see the consequence of
that kind of conversation

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:46.700
between Franz and his wife when
they're talking about

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.233
dissolving that medical
partnership.

00:46:49.233 --> 00:46:51.167
"'This is no go,' he
said suddenly.

00:46:51.167 --> 00:46:54.533
'Well, that's occurred to
me,' Franz admitted.

00:46:54.533 --> 00:46:56.267
'Your heart isn't
in this project

00:46:56.267 --> 00:46:58.233
anymore, Dick.' 'I know.

00:46:58.233 --> 00:47:00.500
I want to leave-- we should
strike some arrangement about

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.367
taking Nicole's money out
gradually.' 'I have thought

00:47:03.367 --> 00:47:04.767
about that too, Dick--

00:47:04.767 --> 00:47:06.300
I have seen this coming.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.433
I'm able to arrange other
backing, and it will be

00:47:09.433 --> 00:47:12.633
possible to take all your money
out by the end of the

00:47:12.633 --> 00:47:16.467
year. ' Dick had not intended
to come to a decision so

00:47:16.467 --> 00:47:20.200
quickly, nor was he prepared
for Franz's so ready

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.833
acquiescence in the break,
yet he was relieved.

00:47:24.833 --> 00:47:29.433
Not without desperation he had
long felt the ethics of his

00:47:29.433 --> 00:47:32.467
profession dissolving into
a lifeless mass."

00:47:32.467 --> 00:47:35.767
So this is the speed
of the break up of

00:47:35.767 --> 00:47:38.633
that medical practice.

00:47:38.633 --> 00:47:43.267
Again, at a speed that Dick had
not counted on, that he

00:47:43.267 --> 00:47:44.767
had not asked for.

00:47:44.767 --> 00:47:49.100
It is somebody else's speed
that has dictated the

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:50.333
narrative development.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.933
I know that we're almost running
out of time, so I'll

00:47:54.933 --> 00:48:00.067
give you the final part of that
resolution against in

00:48:00.067 --> 00:48:02.067
fast motion.

00:48:02.067 --> 00:48:04.467
Actually, I'm going to skip
this, because I know that

00:48:04.467 --> 00:48:05.367
we're running out of time.

00:48:05.367 --> 00:48:09.700
So this will be on
the PowerPoint.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:14.933
But I'm just going to go to
the very end of narrative

00:48:14.933 --> 00:48:16.700
about love as war.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:20.700
We've being seeing this super
imposition of love and World

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.567
War I all the way through.

00:48:22.567 --> 00:48:26.000
And finally, we see the
intrusion of World War I into

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.167
this description of Nicole's
idea of what

00:48:29.167 --> 00:48:31.300
the marriage is like.

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.467
"Again she struggled with it,
fighting him with her small,

00:48:34.467 --> 00:48:38.067
fine eyes, with the plush
arrogance of a top dog, with

00:48:38.067 --> 00:48:40.733
her nascent transference to
another man, with the

00:48:40.733 --> 00:48:44.633
accumulated resentment of years;
she fought him with her

00:48:44.633 --> 00:48:48.533
money and her faith that her
sister disliked him and was

00:48:48.533 --> 00:48:51.700
behind her now; with the thought
of the new enemies he

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.333
was making with his
bitterness...

00:48:54.333 --> 00:48:58.333
For this inner battle she used
even her weaknesses--

00:48:58.333 --> 00:49:02.367
fighting bravely and
courageously with the old cans

00:49:02.367 --> 00:49:06.400
and crockery and bottles,
empty receptacles of her

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.067
expiated sins, outrages,
mistakes.

00:49:09.067 --> 00:49:14.700
And suddenly, in the space of
two minutes she achieved her

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.400
victory and justified herself
to herself without lie or

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.900
subterfuge, cut the
cord forever."

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.500
Two minutes for her to
come to the final

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:27.000
decision about her marriage.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.300
And this is the final image.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:35.733
I was just saying this is a
great moment to pair up with

00:49:35.733 --> 00:49:39.767
the barber scene, the
rape scene in For

00:49:39.767 --> 00:49:41.333
Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:49:41.333 --> 00:49:45.600
"The mirror in front of Nicole
reflected the passage between

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.633
the men's side and the women's,
and Nicole started up

00:49:48.633 --> 00:49:52.767
at the sight of Tommy, Bob and
the man she's going to marry

00:49:52.767 --> 00:49:56.167
entering and wheeling sharply
in the men's shop.

00:49:56.167 --> 00:49:59.433
She knew with a flush of joy
that there was going to be

00:49:59.433 --> 00:50:01.733
some kind of showdown.

00:50:01.733 --> 00:50:05.700
In a minute Dick came into
Nicole's booth, his expression

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:09.267
emerging annoyed from behind
a towel of his

00:50:09.267 --> 00:50:10.967
hastily rinsed face.

00:50:10.967 --> 00:50:13.333
'Your friend has worked himself
up into a state.

00:50:13.333 --> 00:50:15.400
He wants to see us together,
so I agreed to

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.600
have it over with.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.867
Come along!' 'But my hair-- it's
half cut.' 'Nevermind--

00:50:19.867 --> 00:50:23.767
come along!' Resentfully she
had the staring coiffeuse

00:50:23.767 --> 00:50:24.867
remove the towels.

00:50:24.867 --> 00:50:27.500
Feeling messy and unadorned
she followed

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.833
Dick from the hotel.

00:50:28.833 --> 00:50:31.433
Outside Tommy bent
over her hand.

00:50:31.433 --> 00:50:35.600
'We'll go to the Cafe des
Alliees,' said Dick."

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.500
So the same barber shop scene.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:42.367
The same cutting of the hair,
except that in this case, the

00:50:42.367 --> 00:50:45.667
hair is only half cut.

00:50:45.667 --> 00:50:49.633
It is the speed of
that resolution--

00:50:49.633 --> 00:50:54.833
the marriage has ended so
hastily that the hair cutting

00:50:54.833 --> 00:50:57.533
job is not even completely
done.

00:50:57.533 --> 00:51:01.300
But that's the story that
Fitzgerald wants to tell, this

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.533
hastily done job.

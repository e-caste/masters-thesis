00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.257
Prof: Last week we ended
with the Boston Massacre in

00:00:08.257 --> 00:00:11.958
1770,
and I mentioned at the very end

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:17.406
of the lecture the ways in which
both onlookers in the British

00:00:17.406 --> 00:00:22.050
government and the colonists
ended up wondering,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.790
each one, if the other one was
somehow engaged in a plot.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.850
Right?
 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.168
And I mentioned that the
British were perhaps wondering

00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:31.530
if this had all been a plot to
rob the customs house;

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.950
the colonists were wondering
about the possibility of this

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.310
being some kind of ongoing plot
to subdue and repress the

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.690
American colonists.
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.040
So clearly at the end of the
lecture from last week you can

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.680
really begin to sense a growing
sense of mounting hostility,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.010
even among some people a sense
of growing alienation.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.878
And you can hear this on both
sides coming from the accounts

00:00:55.878 --> 00:01:00.911
of the Boston Massacre by both
Gage and Adams--and I read from

00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:02.478
them last week.
 

00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:05.722
And I did mention in class when
I read from them that they were

00:01:05.722 --> 00:01:09.019
of course writing with a purpose
in mind so they were interested

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:11.948
in being particularly bold and
dramatic in what they were

00:01:11.948 --> 00:01:12.629
saying.
 

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:15.846
Gage really had to excuse what
happened and Adams was trying to

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:18.700
promote people to get upset
about what had happened,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.152
but even so you can hear even
just in the way that they framed

00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:25.661
their accounts some of what I'm
talking about here with growing

00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:27.790
hostility,
growing alienation.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.661
So for example,
Gage at the very start of the

00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:34.512
letter that I read from in the
last lecture tells the person

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:38.037
he's writing to that he's
writing this letter to inform

00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:41.623
the King's ministry,
quote, "of the critical

00:01:41.623 --> 00:01:45.467
situation of the troops and the
hatred of the people towards

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:46.379
them."
 

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:48.736
That's how he starts his
letter, which is really

00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:49.440
interesting.
 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.774
So to Gage, clearly,
what he's stating in this

00:01:51.774 --> 00:01:54.834
letter to his people back home
within the King's Ministry is

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:58.155
that it doesn't really even feel
safe for British soldiers on the

00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:01.129
streets of Boston;
the people here hate us.

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:05.888
And Adams also emphasizes this
kind of growing alienation and

00:02:05.888 --> 00:02:08.929
animosity,
and in his case he does it in a

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.818
particularly strong way in a
series of newspaper articles for

00:02:12.818 --> 00:02:16.771
the Boston Gazette that
he wrote a few months after the

00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:17.680
massacre.
 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.045
So Adams writes:
"I appeal to the common

00:02:21.045 --> 00:02:22.500
sense of mankind.
 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.180
To what a state of misery and
infamy must a people be reduced!

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.720
To have a governor by the sole
appointment of the crown;

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.430
under the absolute control of a
weak and arbitrary minister,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.348
to whose dictates he is to
yield an unlimited obedience,

00:02:39.348 --> 00:02:41.961
or forfeit his political
career: while he is to be

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:44.199
supported at the expense of the
people,

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.650
by virtue of an authority
claimed by

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.400
strangers."
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.990
And that's really an
interesting statement.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.334
Strangers--He's referring to
Parliament.

00:02:53.334 --> 00:02:54.020
Right?
 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.282
It's these strangers who are
telling these officials what to

00:02:57.282 --> 00:02:57.560
do.
 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.520
That's again a striking word
and a striking statement.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.457
Now of course,
here Adams says that really

00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:05.151
striking thing--
and then he's careful to add

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:08.882
right after it that,
quote, "For opposing a

00:03:08.882 --> 00:03:13.110
threatened tyranny we have been
not only called,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.958
but in effect adjudged rebels
and traitors to the best of

00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:17.919
kings."
 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.908
OK--He's making a really
important distinction there.

00:03:20.908 --> 00:03:23.788
He's saying,
'Yes, maybe we're upset at what

00:03:23.788 --> 00:03:26.729
Parliament is doing,
maybe Parliament is behaving

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.717
like a group of strangers,
but we are still good British

00:03:29.717 --> 00:03:31.909
subjects and we are loyal to our
King,

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.430
to the best of kings.'
 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.512
And it's an important point,
that even in the midst of all

00:03:36.512 --> 00:03:39.538
of this animosity and all of
these misunderstandings,

00:03:39.538 --> 00:03:42.977
troops are in Boston streets
and the colonists obviously

00:03:42.977 --> 00:03:46.913
still feel like British subjects
who are loyal to their King and

00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:50.727
who are objecting because their
rights as British subjects are

00:03:50.727 --> 00:03:52.038
being violated.
 

00:03:52.038 --> 00:03:53.930
That's the logic that we're
working on here.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.318
And you can see this in
Adams--Samuel Adams' actions.

00:03:59.318 --> 00:04:02.040
At the same time that he's
writing all these sort of

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.508
propaganda newspaper accounts
and trying to stir up animosity,

00:04:05.508 --> 00:04:09.110
he also was writing letters to
people in England trying to

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.774
persuade them and hopefully
inspire them to persuade others

00:04:12.774 --> 00:04:16.310
that the people of Boston were
rightfully defending their

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.406
liberties and deserved to be
defended by people in

00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:23.870
Parliament,
not condemned and punished.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.420
Equally important,
the colonists were not saying

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.199
that they wanted nothing to do
with Parliament,

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.220
or even that Parliament had no
authority over the colonies--

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.552
even though the occasional bold
statement sort of runs out on an

00:04:39.552 --> 00:04:41.509
edge and says 'we hate
Parliament.'

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.365
Most colonists thought that the
colonists--the colonies were

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:47.980
subordinate to Parliament in
some way.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.721
The problem,
Massachusetts Governor Thomas

00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:53.805
Hutchinson later remarked,
is that subordination,

00:04:53.805 --> 00:04:57.190
quote, "was a word without
any precise meaning to it."

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.396
Okay?
 

00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:58.889
That's a really insightful
comment.

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.014
Yeah, okay, colonies are
subordinate but what does that

00:05:04.014 --> 00:05:04.680
mean?
 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.302
And obviously what we're
looking at now is a sort of

00:05:07.302 --> 00:05:10.285
non-debate debate in which it's
clear people have different

00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:13.422
understandings of exactly what
the imperial system is supposed

00:05:13.422 --> 00:05:15.480
to look like and how it
functions.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.288
So all in all it's important to
remember here that even with all

00:05:19.288 --> 00:05:22.853
of this friction that we're
seeing between colonists and the

00:05:22.853 --> 00:05:25.706
British,
the colonists are still loyal

00:05:25.706 --> 00:05:29.697
British subjects who want the
imperial system to function

00:05:29.697 --> 00:05:30.910
happily again.
 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.646
And this is a really great
example of why it's always

00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:35.627
important--
and I think it's particularly

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:38.089
important when studying anything
in the founding era,

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:40.526
but I think history
generally--but when studying the

00:05:40.526 --> 00:05:43.309
Revolution or the founding era--
but when studying the

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.620
Revolution, it's important not
to jump on to the independence

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.430
bandwagon too quickly and assume
that a separation is inevitable,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.029
because the people that we're
studying did not assume that.

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:57.449
It's so easy for us to assume
that, right?

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.428
Because we know it's
coming--but remember Freeman's

00:05:59.428 --> 00:06:01.250
Top Tips for Studying the
Revolution, right?

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.610
Contingency.
 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.084
Our historical subjects didn't
know what was going to

00:06:06.084 --> 00:06:08.959
happen--and anything could have
happened.

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:11.803
So from our perspective,
we're looking at the events

00:06:11.803 --> 00:06:15.093
here-- we almost can't help it,
I think on all of our parts,

00:06:15.093 --> 00:06:16.209
even on my part.
 

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.600
It all looks like a ticking
clock,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.430
like there's an inevitable
pulling away from the British,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.110
and everything I talk about
here represents one step closer

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.851
to independence,
another step closer to

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:25.399
independence.
 

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:28.846
And part of what I'm trying to
say here is: clearly that's not

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:32.350
how the colonists or the British
at this point are thinking.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.949
That's not how they understand
their actions.

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.470
That's not how they understand
what's happening.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.935
The colonists at this point are
not trying to rebel and they're

00:06:39.935 --> 00:06:42.899
not trying to retreat away from
the British empire.

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:44.529
They're trying to fix things.
 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.649
They're trying to figure out
how to fix things.

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:50.158
So in a sense,
the best way to understand the

00:06:50.158 --> 00:06:54.944
events of the first half of the
1770s is to look at the whole

00:06:54.944 --> 00:06:59.810
revolutionary era without
thinking about the Revolution,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.629
and by that I mean the war.
 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.850
Just forget that there's going
to be a war.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.459
The war doesn't exist.
 

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:08.149
I--Always as a historian I do
this to myself when I'm sitting

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:10.213
down to write something,
like if I'm writing a

00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:12.651
project--as I'm working on a
book now that takes me up to the

00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:15.290
Civil War,
so I have to constantly say,

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.180
'Civil War?
 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.372
I don't know if they had a
Civil War.

00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:19.470
What Civil War?'
 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.175
Because my subjects aren't
assuming until a very late point

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:23.389
that there might be one.
 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.519
And I'm sort of saying the same
thing here,

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:29.019
that it's useful to just sort
of put the assumption that

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:32.644
there's going to be a war over
here and watch the logic of

00:07:32.644 --> 00:07:34.300
events as they unfold.
 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.266
It's a good reminder I think
for the study of history

00:07:37.266 --> 00:07:39.502
generally,
because part of what you're

00:07:39.502 --> 00:07:42.821
trying to do as historians is
understand what your historical

00:07:42.821 --> 00:07:46.139
subjects are thinking and why
they're thinking that way,

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:49.666
and you make that much harder
when you stick the outcome right

00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:53.134
in front of them and compare
what they're doing with what you

00:07:53.134 --> 00:07:55.389
assume to be an inevitable
outcome.

00:07:55.389 --> 00:07:55.798
Okay.
 

00:07:55.798 --> 00:08:00.696
Now I mentioned last time that
one way in which the colonists

00:08:00.696 --> 00:08:05.266
responded to the Townshend Acts
was to propose boycotting

00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:09.372
British goods again,
as they had before--in their

00:08:09.372 --> 00:08:13.170
minds successfully--
with the Stamp Act.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.103
So now, feeling even more
threatened, the colonists didn't

00:08:17.103 --> 00:08:20.069
simply urge a boycott in an
informal way.

00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:23.269
Now they actually organize.
 

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:26.795
So remember there's a pattern I
pointed out in an earlier

00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:30.637
lecture when I was talking about
previous attempts at colonial

00:08:30.637 --> 00:08:32.866
union,
and I mentioned in that lecture

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:35.892
that one of the main things that
really drives the colonies to

00:08:35.892 --> 00:08:38.668
join together in an effort is
some kind of a threat--

00:08:38.668 --> 00:08:41.570
so basically self-defense is a
really good motivator.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.378
And so typically in the past
something would threaten the

00:08:44.378 --> 00:08:46.495
colonies,
inter-colonial unity suddenly

00:08:46.495 --> 00:08:48.591
seemed important,
there'd be some kind of a

00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:50.840
movement to do something
together for the moment,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.740
and then when the crisis passed
the unity passed as well.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.379
So we're sort of seeing some of
that go into operation here.

00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:02.830
Way down the road for
Americans, one of the big

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:07.553
lessons of the Revolution would
ultimately be how powerful it is

00:09:07.553 --> 00:09:11.230
when you combine and organize
and associate--

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.668
when you form associations or
organizations--

00:09:13.668 --> 00:09:18.216
and as we'll begin to see soon,
when people organize into small

00:09:18.216 --> 00:09:21.208
coordinated groups,
they can have an enormous

00:09:21.208 --> 00:09:24.573
impact--and that's essentially
what happens here in the course

00:09:24.573 --> 00:09:26.230
of the American Revolution.
 

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:31.918
So between 1768 and 1770,
as they begin to contemplate

00:09:31.918 --> 00:09:37.822
boycotting British goods yet
again, people begin to form

00:09:37.822 --> 00:09:42.009
non-importation associations,
okay?

00:09:42.009 --> 00:09:43.980
Non-importation associations.
 

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.620
Now these associations--these
organizations in a sense--

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.191
were extra-constitutional,
so they're springing up from

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:54.970
outside of the formal political
system,

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.807
but in a variety of different
ways they actually had some real

00:09:57.807 --> 00:09:58.178
power.
 

00:09:58.178 --> 00:10:01.974
In the North,
merchants were at the core of

00:10:01.974 --> 00:10:04.965
this movement,
this non-importation

00:10:04.965 --> 00:10:07.936
association movement,
although it was grounded on

00:10:07.936 --> 00:10:10.384
popular support,
but merchants were really at

00:10:10.384 --> 00:10:13.778
the center of it because one key
to the success of this whole

00:10:13.778 --> 00:10:17.118
endeavor was for merchants to
join together in promising not

00:10:17.118 --> 00:10:18.759
to import British goods.
 

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:21.336
And sometimes merchants
actually signed written

00:10:21.336 --> 00:10:24.418
agreements that they would not
import British goods,

00:10:24.418 --> 00:10:28.298
so unity among the merchants
could be a powerful thing and in

00:10:28.298 --> 00:10:31.210
the North that operated pretty
effectively.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.018
So for example,
when--And I swear I'm really

00:10:34.018 --> 00:10:38.003
not inserting Rhode Island into
every moment in which a random

00:10:38.003 --> 00:10:39.440
bad thing happens.
 

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.443
Today we have two--at least
two--several Rhode Island

00:10:42.443 --> 00:10:44.133
moments,
and every time I come across

00:10:44.133 --> 00:10:46.306
one I think,
is it just because I'm aware of

00:10:46.306 --> 00:10:47.048
Rhode Island?
 

00:10:47.048 --> 00:10:49.476
Is it because I'm thinking
about Rhode Island that Rhode

00:10:49.476 --> 00:10:51.110
Island appears to be there so
much?

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.715
But it makes me think of--I got
my undergraduate degree at

00:10:54.715 --> 00:10:58.779
Pomona College in California,
and Pomona has a thing about

00:10:58.779 --> 00:11:01.744
the number forty-seven,
which they think appears

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:02.649
everywhere, right?
 

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:05.018
Everything is forty-seven,
so when you go to Pomona,

00:11:05.018 --> 00:11:07.340
it's like the magic of
forty-seven constantly being

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.129
talked about.
 

00:11:08.129 --> 00:11:09.460
You add letters up to various
things,

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.960
and it always equals --
ooh!--forty-seven,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.783
and then people graduate from
Pomona and go on to become film

00:11:14.783 --> 00:11:17.278
writers and then you'll see all
these forty-sevens.

00:11:17.278 --> 00:11:19.876
Everyone's like:
there's another one in Star

00:11:19.876 --> 00:11:21.918
Wars;
it's a forty-seven!

00:11:21.918 --> 00:11:24.083
So forty-seven was the Pomona
thing and after a while you

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:26.056
begin to think well,
if I'm looking for forty-sevens

00:11:26.056 --> 00:11:27.678
I'm always going to find
forty-sevens.

00:11:27.678 --> 00:11:29.616
So today I actually--when I was
writing this,

00:11:29.616 --> 00:11:31.820
I thought, maybe I'm doing that
to Rhode Island.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.364
I hope not, but here is a Rhode
Island moment,

00:11:34.364 --> 00:11:34.759
okay?
 

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:36.509
And it's an actual Rhode Island
moment.

00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:39.154
Some Rhode Island merchants
threatened to pull out of the

00:11:39.154 --> 00:11:41.563
non-importation agreement
because it's proving to be

00:11:41.563 --> 00:11:43.360
troublesome in a variety of
ways,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.240
so when these Rhode Island
merchants threatened this,

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.171
merchants in Boston and New
York and Philadelphia actually

00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:55.308
imposed a boycott on Newport and
Providence, Rhode Island.

00:11:55.308 --> 00:11:55.548
Right?
 

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:55.746
Okay.
 

00:11:55.746 --> 00:11:57.139
There's the power of
association.

00:11:57.139 --> 00:11:59.498
'Oh, you're going to--think
you're going to import British

00:11:59.498 --> 00:11:59.830
goods?
 

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.191
Okay.
 

00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:02.428
We boycott you,
Rhode Island.'

00:12:02.428 --> 00:12:04.429
[laughs]
'You're now going to be

00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:05.269
boycotted.'
 

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:06.278
That's pretty powerful.
 

00:12:06.278 --> 00:12:12.028
So merchants were key here,
as was the public.

00:12:12.028 --> 00:12:15.418
So for example,
in various places in the North,

00:12:15.418 --> 00:12:19.727
colonial legislatures sometimes
passed resolutions commending

00:12:19.727 --> 00:12:23.389
these non-importation
associations to the people.

00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:25.548
Right? The people are vital too.
 

00:12:25.548 --> 00:12:28.559
So you have colonial
legislatures passing resolutions

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:31.451
to the public saying,
this whole association effort

00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:34.038
here is good and you should
really listen to it,

00:12:34.038 --> 00:12:37.774
basically lending legitimacy to
what were essentially really ad

00:12:37.774 --> 00:12:41.158
hoc organizations,
ad hoc committees.

00:12:41.158 --> 00:12:43.625
Now in the South,
the non-importation

00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:47.120
associations were more centered
on the populace,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.889
not quite as centered on
merchants,

00:12:50.889 --> 00:12:54.089
so southern non-importation
associations were often very

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:57.870
careful to have members sign on
from throughout the community,

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.590
so not just merchants but
artisans and planters.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.940
And because in the South they
were more popularly based,

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.909
they were more centered on
non-consumption than on

00:13:08.909 --> 00:13:11.460
non-importation--
but of course if you're looking

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.932
at the North,
it's all about seaports and

00:13:13.932 --> 00:13:15.178
importing goods.
 

00:13:15.178 --> 00:13:18.139
It makes sense that in the
South, maybe there'd be more of

00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:20.581
a focus on not consuming
imported British goods,

00:13:20.581 --> 00:13:22.970
as opposed to not importing
British goods.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.871
Now as suggested in the
comments that I just made about

00:13:26.871 --> 00:13:30.918
northern legislatures supporting
northern non-importation

00:13:30.918 --> 00:13:34.159
associations,
it's important to note that

00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:38.615
these are not rebellious groups
acting against the structure of

00:13:38.615 --> 00:13:40.269
colonial government.
 

00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:42.908
They're not competing with
colonial assemblies.

00:13:42.908 --> 00:13:46.389
They're actually in some ways
acting in harmony with them,

00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:49.173
and as a matter of fact some
people who were in these

00:13:49.173 --> 00:13:52.225
non-importation associations
probably were in the colonial

00:13:52.225 --> 00:13:53.350
legislatures too.
 

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.009
So we're not talking about
opposing efforts.

00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:58.091
We're talking about sort of
parallel efforts that sometimes

00:13:58.091 --> 00:13:58.730
intersect.
 

00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.274
Okay.
 

00:13:59.274 --> 00:14:05.162
So as organizations linking the
will of the people with

00:14:05.162 --> 00:14:09.267
politicized action,
these associations are pretty

00:14:09.267 --> 00:14:11.629
significant because--
I'm sure you can see now just

00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:12.980
based on my description of
them--

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.980
they're really promoting broad,
popular,

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.720
organized, coordinated
politicized action.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.225
And this model is going to
become more and more significant

00:14:23.225 --> 00:14:25.220
as the Revolution continues on.
 

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:30.366
And broadly based as they were,
these associations really did

00:14:30.366 --> 00:14:34.399
help to spread a sense of
popular involvement in

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:37.230
resistance to British policy.
 

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:42.075
Boycotting British goods was a
political act and everyone from

00:14:42.075 --> 00:14:46.999
all levels of society including
women could be involved in this

00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:49.952
in some way,
spreading a real sense of

00:14:49.952 --> 00:14:53.739
popular involvement in acts of
resistance to these seemingly

00:14:53.739 --> 00:14:55.600
unfair acts of Parliament.
 

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.259
So average people--we're not
just talking legislators and

00:14:58.259 --> 00:15:00.158
political radicals like Samuel
Adams--

00:15:00.158 --> 00:15:03.423
but average people had a sense
of involvement in a larger

00:15:03.423 --> 00:15:03.889
cause.
 

00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:07.077
And newspaper articles and
broadsides helped spread this

00:15:07.077 --> 00:15:10.630
sense of involvement,
urging the colonists to avoid

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.058
luxuries like imported silks or
English rum,

00:15:14.058 --> 00:15:17.115
and instead people should be
virtuous and they should wear

00:15:17.115 --> 00:15:20.119
homespun clothing made of cloth
that could be made in the

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:22.660
colonies,
and they should drink whiskey

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.058
and beer and cider that could be
made in the colonies.

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:30.000
Now you'll notice things to
drink include whiskey,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.673
beer and cider,
but you'll notice water

00:15:32.673 --> 00:15:35.629
[laughter]
isn't included in that list--

00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:39.714
and actually it wasn't
considered a normal beverage at

00:15:39.714 --> 00:15:42.625
this point in time,
which I always thought was an

00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:43.379
interesting fact.
 

00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:47.672
And when I was in grad school I
read this really interesting

00:15:47.672 --> 00:15:50.000
British novel written in 1796.
 

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.250
It has a very strange title.
 

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:55.058
The title is Hermsprong;
Or Man As He is Not.

00:15:55.058 --> 00:15:57.062
There were a lot of novels
at the time called Man as He

00:15:57.062 --> 00:15:58.942
is,
Man as He is Not--but what

00:15:58.942 --> 00:16:01.769
Hermsprong is about,
among other things,

00:16:01.769 --> 00:16:05.308
is: the central character is
this American in England,

00:16:05.308 --> 00:16:07.899
and he's this sort of exotic,
strange,

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:10.980
independent-minded creature.
 

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.932
And two things that he does
that are sort of shockingly

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:16.995
bizarre to all of the British
onlookers in this novel is:

00:16:16.995 --> 00:16:19.840
he walks places instead of
riding in a carriage.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.765
'Oh, my gosh.
 

00:16:20.765 --> 00:16:24.899
He got up this morning from the
tavern and went walking.'

00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:28.211
And then the second even more
horrifying thing is:

00:16:28.211 --> 00:16:29.429
he drinks water.
 

00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:32.000
[laughter] He drank water.
 

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.909
He had a normal dinner.
 

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:34.690
He drank water.
 

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.202
And there's a weird scene in it
in which someone says,

00:16:37.202 --> 00:16:39.809
'I can't even describe to you
what water tastes like.

00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:40.500
Why do you drink it?
 

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.769
Water has no taste.'
 

00:16:41.769 --> 00:16:43.658
'Water tastes like,' Hermsprong
says, 'water.'

00:16:43.658 --> 00:16:46.850
[laughs]
Water tastes like water.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.418
That was kind of radical.
 

00:16:48.418 --> 00:16:51.168
So, being very patriotic here,
drink whiskey,

00:16:51.168 --> 00:16:52.730
beer and cider,
period.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.080
[laughs]
Don't worry about that boring

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:55.970
water stuff.
 

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.336
It's fascinating that that's
considered a weird thing at that

00:16:59.336 --> 00:16:59.730
time.
 

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:00.125
Okay.
 

00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:03.778
So people are encouraged to
drink and wear only

00:17:03.778 --> 00:17:07.746
colonial-made goods,
and this was true all over the

00:17:07.746 --> 00:17:08.618
place.
 

00:17:08.618 --> 00:17:12.823
So as a symbolic gesture,
Harvard students gave up

00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:14.108
drinking tea.
 

00:17:14.108 --> 00:17:17.586
Students at the College of New
Jersey, now Princeton,

00:17:17.586 --> 00:17:19.259
wore homespun clothing.
 

00:17:19.259 --> 00:17:22.171
And students at Yale
[laughs]--I wonder what this

00:17:22.171 --> 00:17:24.839
says about Yale--renounced
imported wines.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:28.470
[laughter] Huh?
 

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.880
[laughs]
I actually went and

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.029
double-checked that.
 

00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:32.730
I was like: really?
 

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.299
[laughter] Yeah, really.
 

00:17:35.299 --> 00:17:38.250
[laughs] Yale. Okay.
 

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.465
South Carolina assemblymen
renounced the wearing of wigs

00:17:42.465 --> 00:17:45.296
and stockings--
which must have looked very

00:17:45.296 --> 00:17:47.670
odd--with the result one
observer noted,

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.558
that a foreign visitor arriving
in Charleston,

00:17:49.558 --> 00:17:52.592
quote, "would probably
from their dress take them for

00:17:52.592 --> 00:17:55.676
so many unhappy persons ready
for execution who had come to

00:17:55.676 --> 00:17:57.380
petition for a pardon."
 

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.237
[laughter]
Some of these people with no

00:17:59.237 --> 00:18:02.122
wigs and no--kind of dressed
really badly and hanging out in

00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:03.098
the legislature.
 

00:18:03.098 --> 00:18:03.425
Okay.
 

00:18:03.425 --> 00:18:07.016
So clearly, based on those
examples, even Yale students,

00:18:07.016 --> 00:18:10.800
non-import--although maybe I
don't know about the--[laughs]

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.759
not having imported wine.
 

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:17.200
Non-importation does represent
one way in which many people,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.818
and as I said before including
women,

00:18:18.818 --> 00:18:22.640
became directly involved in
colonial protest efforts.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.508
But women were often the
primary purchasers of goods,

00:18:26.508 --> 00:18:29.930
so their actions were central
on this front.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.700
They had to be appealed to,
they had to be included,

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:37.811
so non-importation politicized
the daily activities of women as

00:18:37.811 --> 00:18:40.479
well as men,
spreading feelings of

00:18:40.479 --> 00:18:44.222
community-level patriotism with
people joined in a joint

00:18:44.222 --> 00:18:47.150
political effort to defend their
rights.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.035
So you have people who are sort
of joined in this effort of

00:18:50.035 --> 00:18:52.705
patriotic austerity;
they're all sort of joining in

00:18:52.705 --> 00:18:55.650
a willingness to sacrifice
luxuries for a worthy cause.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.277
Now of course not every
American and not every colonist

00:18:57.277 --> 00:18:58.470
is doing this,
so when I say "joined,

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.660
everyone's joined,"
maybe not everyone,

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.451
but there were a lot of people
who were paying attention to

00:19:04.451 --> 00:19:06.480
this idea of non-importation.
 

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.201
But of course,
now that I've made

00:19:08.201 --> 00:19:10.298
non-importation sound so
impressive,

00:19:10.298 --> 00:19:14.751
I will add that it ultimately
was not a roaring success

00:19:14.751 --> 00:19:17.259
because,
as I just hinted a minute ago,

00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:20.355
not everyone really found it
very easy to surrender English

00:19:20.355 --> 00:19:22.911
luxuries,
and as always there was a lot

00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:23.808
of smuggling.
 

00:19:23.808 --> 00:19:27.920
So it wasn't an amazing roaring
success but that said,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.287
there was some impact on
British manufacturers and there

00:19:32.287 --> 00:19:36.814
was some recognition that
considering the relatively small

00:19:36.814 --> 00:19:41.420
amount of revenue being raised
by the Townshend Acts,

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.338
maybe the effort wasn't worth
all of the trouble.

00:19:45.338 --> 00:19:49.160
So some onlookers in Britain
began to regret the Townshend

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:49.630
Acts.
 

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.488
And it's important to note even
Members of Parliament who were

00:19:53.488 --> 00:19:57.284
sympathetic to the colonies and
who wanted the Townshend Acts

00:19:57.284 --> 00:20:00.041
repealed--
even these sympathetic Members

00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:03.848
didn't question the right of
Parliament to tax the colonies.

00:20:03.848 --> 00:20:06.951
They may have felt that
Parliament was behaving too

00:20:06.951 --> 00:20:10.078
aggressively or unwisely,
maybe it's an unwise policy,

00:20:10.078 --> 00:20:12.696
but even people who were--
considered themselves sort of

00:20:12.696 --> 00:20:14.388
supporters,
real dire supporters of the

00:20:14.388 --> 00:20:17.207
American colonists,
even they were not questioning

00:20:17.207 --> 00:20:21.101
the constitutional supremacy of
Parliament to tax the British

00:20:21.101 --> 00:20:21.880
colonies.
 

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.528
That's almost like a line in
the sand.

00:20:23.528 --> 00:20:26.395
So along these lines,
despite the fact that you have

00:20:26.395 --> 00:20:29.542
some people in Parliament who
are sympathetic towards the

00:20:29.542 --> 00:20:32.258
colonies,
Parliament could not just back

00:20:32.258 --> 00:20:35.279
down and take all of the
Townshend Acts back,

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:37.598
and there are two main reasons
for that.

00:20:37.598 --> 00:20:41.041
There's such power when you say
that: 'there are two

00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:44.619
reasons'--and a hundred people
go "gonk."

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:45.759
Satisfaction.
 

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:47.710
Note-taking.
 

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.460
But there are two main reasons.
 

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.511
First and most obvious,
Parliament just didn't want to

00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:53.430
lose face.
 

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.785
Right?
 

00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:57.161
They felt that they truly were
upholding the supremacy and

00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:59.588
sovereignty of the British
Parliament.

00:20:59.588 --> 00:21:03.846
Second, related to that and
perhaps more important as far as

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:07.660
our understanding of different--
two evolving mindsets is

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.439
concerned,
the sovereignty of Parliament

00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:14.999
over the colonies by this point
had become inextricably bound up

00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:17.750
with the right of taxing
Americans.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.140
And I'll repeat that again.
 

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.096
By this point,
the sovereignty of Parliament

00:21:22.096 --> 00:21:26.086
over the colonies had become
inextricably bound up with the

00:21:26.086 --> 00:21:28.769
right of taxing American
colonists.

00:21:28.769 --> 00:21:32.540
So at this point,
Parliament couldn't back down

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:37.544
on a tax without seeming to give
up their sovereignty over the

00:21:37.544 --> 00:21:38.608
colonies.
 

00:21:38.608 --> 00:21:43.673
By 1770, the right of taxation
was not just a means of

00:21:43.673 --> 00:21:47.210
producing revenue for the
British,

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:52.196
but it actually had become an
assertion of British sovereignty

00:21:52.196 --> 00:21:54.160
over its own colonies.
 

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:54.569
Okay.
 

00:21:54.569 --> 00:21:58.097
So now we're in 1770 and
surprise, surprise,

00:21:58.097 --> 00:22:01.788
by this time we have a new
Prime Minister.

00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:04.259
Lord North is now Prime
Minister.

00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:06.538
Townshend is gone,
although we're sort of in a

00:22:06.538 --> 00:22:08.766
period of revolving doors of
Prime Ministers,

00:22:08.766 --> 00:22:10.588
but in this case Townshend
died.

00:22:10.588 --> 00:22:14.210
Townshend actually died back in
1767 and so Lord North is the

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.019
next person who comes along.
 

00:22:16.019 --> 00:22:18.890
Townshend's Acts live on
without him for a little while,

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:23.519
but now Lord North is the Prime
Minister so he assumes this

00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:28.548
position and with familiar logic
he decides that the only way to

00:22:28.548 --> 00:22:33.257
withdraw the Townshend Acts is
going to be to leave behind a

00:22:33.257 --> 00:22:37.567
token tax in the colonies to
prove that England reigned

00:22:37.567 --> 00:22:41.160
supreme over its colonial
properties.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.778
As Lord North himself put it,
"If I thought I could

00:22:45.778 --> 00:22:50.166
appease that factious and
disobedient temper which

00:22:50.166 --> 00:22:53.660
prevails, I should be glad to do
it.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.182
And yet, to these people,
who ought to be our subjects,

00:22:57.182 --> 00:23:00.967
we are to make concessions,
because they have the hardihood

00:23:00.967 --> 00:23:02.858
to set us at defiance!...
 

00:23:02.858 --> 00:23:04.811
Upon my word,
if we are to run after America

00:23:04.811 --> 00:23:06.950
in search of reconciliation,
in this way,

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.934
I do not know a single act of
Parliament that will

00:23:09.934 --> 00:23:10.910
remain."
 

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.833
But despite having said all
that, North concluded this

00:23:13.833 --> 00:23:15.818
speech by saying he wanted to
be,

00:23:15.818 --> 00:23:18.259
quote, "thought,
what I really am,

00:23:18.259 --> 00:23:21.240
to the best of my conviction--a
friend to trade,

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.778
a friend to America."
 

00:23:23.778 --> 00:23:23.974
Okay.
 

00:23:23.974 --> 00:23:26.009
There's a lot of stuff bound up
in that statement--

00:23:26.009 --> 00:23:29.164
but you can really see him
processing through what's

00:23:29.164 --> 00:23:32.692
happening versus what he assumes
about the workings of the

00:23:32.692 --> 00:23:33.930
imperial system.
 

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.795
It's a complicated situation to
North and the British as well as

00:23:37.795 --> 00:23:38.900
to the colonies.
 

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.489
So in the end,
thinking about all of this and

00:23:41.489 --> 00:23:44.165
thinking well,
I need to leave some kind of

00:23:44.165 --> 00:23:47.038
tax in place to prove
Parliamentary supremacy,

00:23:47.038 --> 00:23:51.078
he decides to leave the tea tax
in effect,

00:23:51.078 --> 00:23:56.000
and the logic behind that is,
of all the taxed items this was

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.269
the most profitable to England,
and it couldn't be manufactured

00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:04.067
in the colonies,
so it would have to be

00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:07.400
imported--plus it was kind of
central to socializing.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.640
Everybody drank tea.
 

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.328
That was the thing to do--was
to drink tea with great

00:24:11.328 --> 00:24:13.650
ceremony--
among some people to have tea

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.348
cups and tea spoons--
so North just assumed on a

00:24:16.348 --> 00:24:19.058
whole bunch of levels:
can't be easily boycotted;

00:24:19.058 --> 00:24:22.690
they really like tea in those
colonies, just like us here;

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.819
makes us a reasonable amount of
money;

00:24:24.819 --> 00:24:27.568
that's the thing that'll stay.
 

00:24:27.568 --> 00:24:31.328
Now when I was writing this
lecture, I was thinking about

00:24:31.328 --> 00:24:31.798
that.
 

00:24:31.798 --> 00:24:34.989
I was thinking about tea and
tea ceremonies and the drinking

00:24:34.989 --> 00:24:37.561
of tea,
and I suppose we all have in

00:24:37.561 --> 00:24:41.410
our mind a sense of that being
the case in England,

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.220
but it was no less the case in
the colonies.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.628
And when I was--I guess when I
was researching my first book I

00:24:48.628 --> 00:24:50.220
came across a story.
 

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.875
I'm going to mention it now
only because it relates to the

00:24:52.875 --> 00:24:55.720
tea ceremony and this is my
opportunity to tell this story.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.243
There will be random moments
when I just have to tell a story

00:24:58.243 --> 00:24:59.759
'cause you guys are like
hostages.

00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:01.788
[laughter]
It means I get to say whatever

00:25:01.788 --> 00:25:03.970
I want and I get to tell random
stories--

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.961
but this actually does
demonstrate the sort of ritual

00:25:06.961 --> 00:25:08.630
of tea drinking everywhere.
 

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:12.450
So the whole tea ceremony was
important in the colonies.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:15.634
I came across this account from
a foreign observer,

00:25:15.634 --> 00:25:17.098
actually from France.
 

00:25:17.098 --> 00:25:19.701
And he shows up in the
colonies, and he says in a

00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:22.845
letter to a friend that he'd
never quite seen anything like

00:25:22.845 --> 00:25:25.230
the colonial obsession with
serving tea.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.009
And he describes this visit
that he paid to a woman,

00:25:28.009 --> 00:25:31.223
and he said that he would take
a sip and then she would

00:25:31.223 --> 00:25:35.391
immediately refill the cup,
so he couldn't figure out how

00:25:35.391 --> 00:25:36.868
to empty the cup.
 

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:38.768
Basically, he doesn't want any
more tea [laughs]

00:25:38.768 --> 00:25:40.910
and he can't figure out how to
make it stop coming.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.779
'I'll drink a little more fast.
 

00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:45.073
Maybe she'll'--And he kept
basically trying out one thing

00:25:45.073 --> 00:25:47.038
after another and she kept
refilling the cup--

00:25:47.038 --> 00:25:48.348
and then he felt compelled to
drink,

00:25:48.348 --> 00:25:49.950
because it was the proper thing
to do--

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.318
was to eat or drink what he was
served.

00:25:52.318 --> 00:25:55.384
He didn't know that the code in
the tea ceremony to stop tea

00:25:55.384 --> 00:25:58.604
from being poured was to place
your tea spoon across the top of

00:25:58.604 --> 00:25:59.279
your cup.
 

00:25:59.279 --> 00:25:59.586
Right?
 

00:25:59.586 --> 00:26:02.558
He didn't think about that,
so at one point he's desperate,

00:26:02.558 --> 00:26:05.019
because he just can't deal with
any more tea.

00:26:05.019 --> 00:26:08.411
So she pours more tea in his
cup and when she turned away he

00:26:08.411 --> 00:26:11.974
actually swallowed everything in
the cup in a gulp and then put

00:26:11.974 --> 00:26:13.470
the cup in his pocket.
 

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:18.288
[laughter]
Like she's not going to notice.

00:26:18.288 --> 00:26:20.042
[laughs]
Right?

00:26:20.042 --> 00:26:22.798
Oh, you ate the cup.
 

00:26:22.798 --> 00:26:24.644
[laughter]
And he doesn't say what

00:26:24.644 --> 00:26:25.259
happened.
 

00:26:25.259 --> 00:26:27.327
He just describes putting it in
his pocket like:

00:26:27.327 --> 00:26:27.680
There.
 

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.339
Now I've settled that.
 

00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:30.848
Great thinking.
 

00:26:30.848 --> 00:26:33.188
[laughter]
They were serious about tea

00:26:33.188 --> 00:26:34.009
ceremonies.
 

00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:34.468
Okay.
 

00:26:34.468 --> 00:26:39.781
So with full knowledge of the
cultural importance of tea in

00:26:39.781 --> 00:26:43.032
the colonies,
North left the tea tax in

00:26:43.032 --> 00:26:46.624
effect, hoping that a slight
concession on the part of

00:26:46.624 --> 00:26:50.078
England maybe would chip away at
colonial unity.

00:26:50.078 --> 00:26:50.458
Right?
 

00:26:50.458 --> 00:26:54.051
Maybe some colonists would be
convinced to stop resisting,

00:26:54.051 --> 00:26:57.583
maybe non-importation would
thus collapse--and eventually

00:26:57.583 --> 00:26:59.788
non-importation does collapse.
 

00:26:59.788 --> 00:27:04.920
It kind of dribbles to a
close--1770,1771.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.183
And as with the Stamp Act,
both the colonies and the

00:27:08.183 --> 00:27:12.088
British administration assumed
that they had emerged from this

00:27:12.088 --> 00:27:13.048
victorious.
 

00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:13.384
Right?
 

00:27:13.384 --> 00:27:16.298
The colonies think ha,
we got most of those offensive

00:27:16.298 --> 00:27:17.250
acts repealed.
 

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.895
Parliament thinks well,
we are still maintaining our

00:27:19.895 --> 00:27:21.920
sovereignty so our point stands
firm.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.951
And of course this did nothing
to resolve the conflict about

00:27:25.951 --> 00:27:28.480
the precise nature of
sovereignty,

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.910
the precise nature of the
imperial system,

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:36.500
and the precise power of
Parliament over the colonies.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.848
At about this time,
however, Lord North once again,

00:27:39.848 --> 00:27:42.470
thinking about the colonies,
attempting reform,

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.380
he's struggling clearly--You
have to feel--

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.856
I just feel bad for a Prime
Minister at this moment of

00:27:47.856 --> 00:27:49.538
massive confusion in the
colonies.

00:27:49.538 --> 00:27:52.218
He's trying to figure out some
way to get colonial affairs in

00:27:52.218 --> 00:27:54.318
control,
so at this point he figures

00:27:54.318 --> 00:27:57.596
maybe one way to sort of calm
things down is to focus on

00:27:57.596 --> 00:27:58.608
Massachusetts.
 

00:27:58.608 --> 00:27:58.907
Right?
 

00:27:58.907 --> 00:28:01.594
Massachusetts is the pesky
colony, bad things happen in

00:28:01.594 --> 00:28:03.969
Massachusetts,
so he says maybe one way to

00:28:03.969 --> 00:28:07.422
resolve things is to make a few
little tweaks in their political

00:28:07.422 --> 00:28:07.970
system.
 

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:12.376
So he decides that henceforth
Superior Court judges will be

00:28:12.376 --> 00:28:17.240
paid by tax revenue collected by
the Crown from the colonies,

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.911
which means in effect Superior
Court judges are not going to be

00:28:19.911 --> 00:28:23.760
paid by colonial legislatures;
they're going to be paid by the

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.318
Crown.
 

00:28:24.318 --> 00:28:24.652
Okay.
 

00:28:24.652 --> 00:28:28.641
So certainly to some people in
Massachusetts this seemed like

00:28:28.641 --> 00:28:31.766
it's a way to make judges
accountable to British

00:28:31.766 --> 00:28:34.358
authorities and not to
colonists,

00:28:34.358 --> 00:28:38.544
and in a sense that was part of
what North was trying to do

00:28:38.544 --> 00:28:39.048
here.
 

00:28:39.048 --> 00:28:43.262
But unfortunately about the
same time, in June of 1772,

00:28:43.262 --> 00:28:46.150
there was a crisis in Rhode
Island.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.900
[laughter]
A British ship,

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:53.457
the Gaspee,
which was used in Rhode Island

00:28:53.457 --> 00:28:57.586
to prevent smuggling,
ran aground in Rhode Island and

00:28:57.586 --> 00:29:00.769
that night colonists swarmed
aboard it,

00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:03.630
forced the crew off and burned
it to the ground.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:06.540
That's kind of a strong
anti-British "we hate that

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.588
you're stopping smuggling"
act.

00:29:08.588 --> 00:29:13.732
So the Crown responded by
creating a commission of inquiry

00:29:13.732 --> 00:29:17.965
to investigate the matter,
and ultimately this committee

00:29:17.965 --> 00:29:20.140
decides it's going to let this
slide,

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.750
which is a major concession
because [laughs]

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.210
burning one of His Majesty's
ships is a serious matter.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.910
Right? It's not a minor crime.
 

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:32.625
Even so, colonists just took
offense at the existence of the

00:29:32.625 --> 00:29:35.964
commission which seemed to
interfere with the internal

00:29:35.964 --> 00:29:38.928
affairs of a colony,
and even worse--this gets back

00:29:38.928 --> 00:29:41.750
to something that people have
been upset about in the colonies

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.894
before--
the commission would have sent

00:29:43.894 --> 00:29:47.000
the people who were going to be
tried to England for their

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.035
trials,
right?

00:29:48.035 --> 00:29:51.808
So--and this also feels like a
threat to self-rule.

00:29:51.808 --> 00:29:53.359
So you have these sorts of
things going on.

00:29:53.359 --> 00:29:54.710
They're individual acts.
 

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.968
They're not connected,
but they're--in the eyes of

00:29:56.968 --> 00:29:58.490
many colonists not good things.
 

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:01.955
Samuel Adams,
brilliant propagandist that he

00:30:01.955 --> 00:30:04.376
is,
decides there has to be an

00:30:04.376 --> 00:30:09.073
immediate response to these new
encroachments on colonial rights

00:30:09.073 --> 00:30:12.130
and it needs to not just be in
Boston.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.567
There needs to be a widespread
inter-state protest to what's

00:30:15.567 --> 00:30:18.013
happening and to the
implications of what's

00:30:18.013 --> 00:30:18.828
happening.
 

00:30:18.828 --> 00:30:24.105
So in November of 1772,
building on the whole model of

00:30:24.105 --> 00:30:27.690
the non-importation
associations,

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:32.127
he suggests in the Boston town
meeting that a committee of

00:30:32.127 --> 00:30:36.178
correspondence be formed in
Boston to communicate the

00:30:36.178 --> 00:30:40.772
current state of affairs in
Boston to the rest of the colony

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:42.489
and,
quote, "to the

00:30:42.489 --> 00:30:43.440
world"-- right?
 

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.722
He's ambitious,
Samuel Adams--and to solicit

00:30:46.722 --> 00:30:47.640
responses.
 

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.747
So a committee of
correspondence of roughly

00:30:50.747 --> 00:30:54.150
twenty-one men is created with
the purpose--

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:56.048
as stated in the Boston town
meeting--

00:30:56.048 --> 00:30:58.362
of stating, quote,
"the rights of the

00:30:58.362 --> 00:31:01.068
Colonists and of this Province
in particular,

00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:04.630
as men and Christians,
and as subjects"--

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.190
which is an interesting
trio--as men,

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:09.653
as Christians and as subjects,
and "to communicate and

00:31:09.653 --> 00:31:13.236
publish the same to the several
towns and to the world as the

00:31:13.236 --> 00:31:16.048
sense of this town,
with the infringements and

00:31:16.048 --> 00:31:17.960
violations thereof that have
been,

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.308
or from time to time may be,
made." Right?

00:31:20.308 --> 00:31:23.173
Infringements that have been
made or may be made,

00:31:23.173 --> 00:31:23.588
right?
 

00:31:23.588 --> 00:31:26.010
So he's even--Something else is
going to happen,

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:27.916
and if it is,
we've got a committee of

00:31:27.916 --> 00:31:29.358
correspondence in place.
 

00:31:29.358 --> 00:31:32.278
So by the end of November of
1772,

00:31:32.278 --> 00:31:36.277
the committee had produced an
open letter to all of the towns

00:31:36.277 --> 00:31:40.044
in Massachusetts urging them,
quote, not "to doze or sit

00:31:40.044 --> 00:31:43.049
supinely indifferent on the
brink of destruction"--

00:31:43.049 --> 00:31:45.721
that Samuel Adams;
he's really a master at the

00:31:45.721 --> 00:31:48.779
strong words--and to create
their own committees of

00:31:48.779 --> 00:31:49.880
correspondence.
 

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:54.098
And more than half of the towns
in Massachusetts responded,

00:31:54.098 --> 00:31:59.210
encouraging more widespread
participation in the controversy

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.778
than before,
more widespread willingness to

00:32:02.778 --> 00:32:07.012
act alongside the normal
political system to protest what

00:32:07.012 --> 00:32:10.190
people saw as an
unconstitutional act--

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.501
and there were more than eighty
of these local committees of

00:32:13.501 --> 00:32:16.308
correspondence created within
just a few months.

00:32:16.308 --> 00:32:19.759
One observer called these
committees,

00:32:19.759 --> 00:32:23.010
quote, "the foulest,
subtlest and most venomous

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:26.390
serpent ever issued from the egg
of sedition."

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:29.256
And you can kind of see this
person's fears.

00:32:29.256 --> 00:32:29.788
Right?
 

00:32:29.788 --> 00:32:33.708
This is a person who sees what
he perceives to be as organized

00:32:33.708 --> 00:32:37.240
resistance to the British
government sort of bubbling up

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.588
in Massachusetts.
 

00:32:38.588 --> 00:32:41.440
And this sort of bubbling
committees,

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.385
these committees of
correspondence are going to be

00:32:43.385 --> 00:32:45.727
spreading sedition,
according to this person,

00:32:45.727 --> 00:32:48.720
throughout the colonies and
possibly to the world.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.511
And this person had a right to
be suspicious,

00:32:51.511 --> 00:32:55.510
because organized resistance is
partly what these committees are

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.400
all about.
 

00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:01.145
So this unfolding of events in
Massachusetts led radicals

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:05.130
elsewhere to do what
Massachusetts had done,

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:08.717
and create their own committees
of correspondence for

00:33:08.717 --> 00:33:12.650
communication within colonies
and between the colonies.

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:16.759
So within roughly a year,
by very, very early in 1774,

00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:20.946
there were committees of
correspondence in almost every

00:33:20.946 --> 00:33:21.798
colony.
 

00:33:21.798 --> 00:33:24.420
And these committees did a
number of things.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.770
They strengthened ties between
radical colonies like

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:33.720
Massachusetts and less active or
less-radical colonies,

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.038
and they created a way for
radical-minded people in

00:33:37.038 --> 00:33:40.288
different colonies to interact
with each other.

00:33:40.288 --> 00:33:43.338
So clearly these committees of
correspondence--

00:33:43.338 --> 00:33:45.500
just like the non-importation
associations--

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.405
are an important stepping-stone
in the growing sense of colonial

00:33:50.405 --> 00:33:51.029
unity.
 

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:56.480
Now it was at this moment that
Lord North passed the Tea Act.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.035
It actually had less to do with
the colonies than it had to do

00:34:01.035 --> 00:34:03.650
with a miserably timed
necessity.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:07.141
North was trying to save the
East India Tea Company from

00:34:07.141 --> 00:34:07.838
collapse.
 

00:34:07.838 --> 00:34:15.730
The Tea Act of 1773 removed
import duties on East India tea,

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.070
which basically made British
tea cheaper than Dutch tea,

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:23.190
in the hope that this would
inspire colonists to purchase

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:24.219
British tea.
 

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:24.509
Okay.
 

00:34:24.509 --> 00:34:27.635
So you would think and
certainly you can understand why

00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:31.226
Lord North would think that this
would make the colonists happy

00:34:31.226 --> 00:34:33.659
because he is lowering duties on
tea.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:37.360
The East India Company
hopefully, as he's thinking,

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.610
would be solvent,
maybe the Townshend Act,

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:42.920
my little tea tax left in place
there,

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.150
is going to matter less because
I've just lowered duties on some

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.539
tea,
so maybe now the colonists will

00:34:48.539 --> 00:34:51.137
pay the tea tax,
Parliament will obviously have

00:34:51.137 --> 00:34:53.309
the right to tax the colonies in
their eyes,

00:34:53.309 --> 00:34:55.670
and maybe this will actually
quiet things a little.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:59.367
But once again the British
government misjudged the

00:34:59.367 --> 00:35:02.190
colonial reaction--
again showing how you have

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.268
different evolving mindsets here
and they're not necessarily,

00:35:05.268 --> 00:35:09.155
either one, understanding
what's happening in the other

00:35:09.155 --> 00:35:09.659
case.
 

00:35:09.659 --> 00:35:12.724
So the colonists not
surprisingly had their own

00:35:12.724 --> 00:35:14.590
interpretation of the act.
 

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.565
They actually felt that the act
was granting a monopoly to the

00:35:18.565 --> 00:35:21.998
East India Tea Company,
enforcing the control of the

00:35:21.998 --> 00:35:25.601
British government over what
they felt like was supposed to

00:35:25.601 --> 00:35:28.597
be free trade,
so maybe in the future the

00:35:28.597 --> 00:35:32.934
British would begin to control
the importation of other goods

00:35:32.934 --> 00:35:33.730
as well.
 

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:39.704
Okay, so somewhat paradoxically
by reducing the duty on English

00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:42.402
tea,
North helped fuel colonial

00:35:42.402 --> 00:35:46.603
fears that there was a plot in
England against colonial

00:35:46.603 --> 00:35:49.478
rights--
which inspired the colonists to

00:35:49.478 --> 00:35:52.998
imagine the worst immediately
when a suspicious act was

00:35:52.998 --> 00:35:53.650
passed.
 

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:57.320
So: 'oh, this must be part of
that plot, this Tea Act.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.780
Yes, he may seem to be lowering
the duty on tea.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.659
There must be another motive.
 

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:03.750
Ah, they must be trying to
control our trade.'

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.460
You can sort of see on both
sides how the logic makes sense.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.539
You can also see how this is a
problem.

00:36:09.539 --> 00:36:12.547
As with the Stamp Act,
colonists responded by

00:36:12.547 --> 00:36:16.376
pinpointing the people who would
be distributing the tea,

00:36:16.376 --> 00:36:17.059
right?
 

00:36:17.059 --> 00:36:18.780
So first, you didn't want to be
a stamp agent;

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.260
now you don't want to be a
person selling tea.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.943
So they pinpointed the
merchants who were selling tea

00:36:24.943 --> 00:36:27.059
and they pressured them not to
sell it.

00:36:27.059 --> 00:36:30.525
And broadsides were posted in
public places to inform and

00:36:30.525 --> 00:36:33.280
involve the populace,
saying things like:

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.998
"Friends!--
Brethren!-- Countrymen--that

00:36:35.998 --> 00:36:38.221
worst of plagues,
the detested TEA,

00:36:38.221 --> 00:36:41.610
shipped for this port by the
East-India Company,

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:45.786
is now arrived in this Harbour;
the Hour of Destruction,

00:36:45.786 --> 00:36:49.135
or manly opposition to the
Machinations of Tyranny,

00:36:49.135 --> 00:36:51.280
stares you in the face."
 

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.018
It's a big drama.
 

00:36:53.018 --> 00:36:56.021
These are not people who do
things halfway:

00:36:56.021 --> 00:37:00.739
destruction--staring you in the
face--tyranny--manly opposition.

00:37:00.739 --> 00:37:05.188
So when ships loaded with tea
began arriving in major colonial

00:37:05.188 --> 00:37:08.469
ports, obviously things become
more heated.

00:37:08.469 --> 00:37:13.302
In some cities the tea was just
unloaded and then locked up in a

00:37:13.302 --> 00:37:16.139
warehouse and left there,
not sold.

00:37:16.139 --> 00:37:20.367
In Philadelphia and New York
they actually kept these ships

00:37:20.367 --> 00:37:23.650
with tea on them out away from
the harbor,

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:26.510
so that they just never came in
close to shore.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:30.702
However, in Boston [laughs]
Governor Hutchinson decided to

00:37:30.702 --> 00:37:33.717
force the issue,
in his mind as a means of

00:37:33.717 --> 00:37:37.469
protecting British sovereignty
in the colonies.

00:37:37.469 --> 00:37:41.730
So Hutchinson ordered the tea
ships to be unloaded.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:42.164
Okay.
 

00:37:42.164 --> 00:37:47.027
So we have an eyewitness
account of someone who heard the

00:37:47.027 --> 00:37:51.757
response to that announcement,
who heard what happened when

00:37:51.757 --> 00:37:55.757
it--people heard that Hutchinson
was going to ask for the tea to

00:37:55.757 --> 00:37:58.742
be unloaded and it was at a
Boston town meeting:

00:37:58.742 --> 00:38:00.139
December 16,1773.
 

00:38:00.139 --> 00:38:04.492
Basically, people knew that
there was this tea-bearing ship

00:38:04.492 --> 00:38:07.927
in the harbor,
and they knew that on December

00:38:07.927 --> 00:38:11.199
16, in the evening,
the captain of that ship was

00:38:11.199 --> 00:38:14.969
going to go to the town meeting
and tell the town meeting--

00:38:14.969 --> 00:38:16.518
Samuel Adams who was chairing
the meeting--

00:38:16.518 --> 00:38:18.969
what was going to happen with
the tea.

00:38:18.969 --> 00:38:21.123
People knew that,
and thus there was an enormous

00:38:21.123 --> 00:38:23.646
crowd gathered outside of the
Old South Church where the

00:38:23.646 --> 00:38:26.030
meeting was being held to see
what would happen.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.347
Right?
 

00:38:26.347 --> 00:38:28.579
So everyone knows this is the
stare-down.

00:38:28.579 --> 00:38:30.260
Okay. What's going to happen?
 

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.360
Is the tea coming off the boats?
 

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.000
And if the tea's coming off the
boats, what happens next?

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.425
Big crowd, and here's what this
eyewitness heard as the crowd

00:38:37.425 --> 00:38:40.623
learned that Hutchinson was
insisting on the unloading of

00:38:40.623 --> 00:38:41.309
the tea.
 

00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:44.744
So this eyewitness,
he's at home drinking tea

00:38:44.744 --> 00:38:46.382
[laughs]
when he said,

00:38:46.382 --> 00:38:49.739
I heard "such prodigious
shouts...

00:38:49.739 --> 00:38:52.465
that induced me,
while drinking tea at home,

00:38:52.465 --> 00:38:54.809
to go out and know the cause of
it.

00:38:54.809 --> 00:38:57.530
The meeting house was so
crowded I could get no farther

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:00.503
than the porch ...You'd have
thought that the inhabitants of

00:39:00.503 --> 00:39:02.570
the infernal regions had broke
loose.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:05.021
For my part,
I went contentedly home and

00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:06.530
finished my tea."
 

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:08.440
[laughter] What's going on?
 

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.929
I got to go finish my tea.
 

00:39:09.929 --> 00:39:12.686
[laughs]
"But was soon informed

00:39:12.686 --> 00:39:15.130
what was going forward."
 

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:15.353
Right?
 

00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.110
Is soon told they're going to
unload the tea,

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:20.195
"but still not crediting
it without ocular

00:39:20.195 --> 00:39:22.007
demonstration"
[laughs]

00:39:22.007 --> 00:39:23.766
okay,
eighteenth century:

00:39:23.766 --> 00:39:25.945
I wanted to see it for myself,
right?

00:39:25.945 --> 00:39:28.253
But not crediting it without
"ocular

00:39:28.253 --> 00:39:30.559
demonstration,"
I went to watch.

00:39:30.559 --> 00:39:30.907
Okay.
 

00:39:30.907 --> 00:39:35.150
So our eyewitness goes off to
get ocular demonstrations of the

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:39.065
unloading of the tea,
but what he ends up watching is

00:39:39.065 --> 00:39:42.856
an assemblage of somewhere
between thirty and sixty men

00:39:42.856 --> 00:39:47.280
disguised as Indians aboard
three ships on Griffin's Wharf,

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:52.666
and these men basically worked
on those ships for several hours

00:39:52.666 --> 00:39:56.489
and threw 342 chests of tea over
the side.

00:39:56.489 --> 00:40:00.420
A huge number of people watched
from the docks and,

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.849
as I mentioned before when I
was talking about the Stamp Act,

00:40:03.849 --> 00:40:06.443
riots and popular
demonstrations were kind of a

00:40:06.443 --> 00:40:08.980
regular part of the system in
the colonies.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.240
Riots were not normally chaotic
moments of violence and disorder

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.621
unless you were
shingle-by-shingle taking apart

00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:16.485
[laughs]
the house of the stamp agent

00:40:16.485 --> 00:40:18.835
for example,
but usually they were almost

00:40:18.835 --> 00:40:20.690
ritualized demonstrations of
protest.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:25.590
So what we have here is not a
wild riot on these ships.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:29.414
Protestors were so careful not
to do anything other than make

00:40:29.414 --> 00:40:32.103
their point,
not to do anything other than

00:40:32.103 --> 00:40:34.777
destroy tea,
that allegedly they brought a

00:40:34.777 --> 00:40:38.454
locksmith with them to open
locks or repair locks that were

00:40:38.454 --> 00:40:39.090
broken.
 

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:40.594
These are people who understand
property rights.

00:40:40.594 --> 00:40:40.849
Right?
 

00:40:40.849 --> 00:40:41.739
'We value property.
 

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:43.030
We don't want to break your
locks.'

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.730
They're not actually out to get
the ship owners;

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.719
they just want the tea.
 

00:40:46.719 --> 00:40:49.641
So they actually were very
orderly about the way in which

00:40:49.641 --> 00:40:51.260
they went to destroy the tea.
 

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:54.054
So to give us a sense of what
happened, I'm going to use an

00:40:54.054 --> 00:40:55.260
account by another man.
 

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.900
His name is George Hughes.
 

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.724
He actually helped destroy the
tea, so he's one of the people

00:40:59.724 --> 00:41:01.559
throwing chests of tea over the
side.

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:04.315
And in his account,
Hughes says that back at the

00:41:04.315 --> 00:41:06.675
Old South Church,
the announcement that

00:41:06.675 --> 00:41:10.289
Hutchinson was going to order
the unloading of the tea led to,

00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:13.300
quote, "a general huzzah
for Griffin's Wharf."

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.393
A huzzah is an
eighteenth-century hooray:

00:41:16.393 --> 00:41:19.099
'hooray, off to Griffin's
Wharf.'

00:41:19.099 --> 00:41:20.599
So these guys were like:
You're going to unload the tea?

00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:23.295
We're there [laughs]
and something bad is going to

00:41:23.295 --> 00:41:23.789
happen.
 

00:41:23.789 --> 00:41:28.059
So Hughes, a participant in
what would come to be known--

00:41:28.059 --> 00:41:29.619
but not until well into the
nineteenth century--

00:41:29.619 --> 00:41:33.510
as the Boston Tea Party,
continues his account.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:35.900
He says, "It was now
evening, and I immediately

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.853
dressed myself in the costume of
an Indian equipped with a small

00:41:38.853 --> 00:41:39.510
hatchet...
 

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.887
with which and a club,
after having painted my face

00:41:41.887 --> 00:41:44.550
and hands with coal dust in the
shop of a blacksmith,

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.177
I repaired to Griffin's Wharf
where the ships lay that

00:41:47.177 --> 00:41:49.856
contained the tea,"
and Hughes is ordered to go to

00:41:49.856 --> 00:41:52.335
the captain and "demand of
him the keys to the

00:41:52.335 --> 00:41:54.269
hatches"
because they don't want to

00:41:54.269 --> 00:41:56.681
damage the ship,
"and a dozen candles"

00:41:56.681 --> 00:41:58.230
so that they can see what
they're doing.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.195
[laughs]
Right?

00:41:59.195 --> 00:42:01.820
Just being very sort of polite
here.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.992
"The captain promptly
replied and delivered the

00:42:03.992 --> 00:42:06.721
articles but requested me at the
same time to do no damage to the

00:42:06.721 --> 00:42:07.829
ship or rigging."
 

00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:11.070
So these Indians cut and split
the tea chests with their

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.250
tomahawks and threw them
overboard.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.400
There were some people who
tried to climb on board the ship

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.900
to scoop up tea to take back
home with them.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.068
This was not a wise thing to do
because they were caught and

00:42:22.068 --> 00:42:25.291
their hats and wigs were dumped
in the water with the tea and

00:42:25.291 --> 00:42:27.280
they were kicked away,
literally.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.543
The crowd sort of just kicked
them away from the ships on the

00:42:30.543 --> 00:42:30.980
wharf.
 

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.329
So Hughes concludes his account
by saying,

00:42:33.329 --> 00:42:36.429
"We then quietly retired
to our several places of

00:42:36.429 --> 00:42:38.621
residence,
without having any conversation

00:42:38.621 --> 00:42:41.297
with each other or taking any
measures to discover who were

00:42:41.297 --> 00:42:42.730
our associates,"
right?

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:44.340
Because they're all
disguised."

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.454
"Nor do I recollect of our
having had the knowledge of the

00:42:47.454 --> 00:42:50.320
name of a single individual
concerned in the affair....

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.510
There appeared to be an
understanding that each

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:55.418
individual should volunteer his
services, keep his own secret,

00:42:55.418 --> 00:42:57.420
and risk the consequences for
himself.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.768
No disorder took place during
that transaction,

00:43:00.768 --> 00:43:03.393
and it was observed at that
time that the stillest night

00:43:03.393 --> 00:43:06.019
ensued that Boston had enjoyed
for many months."

00:43:06.019 --> 00:43:07.130
So, not wild abandon.
 

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:10.869
It's a pretty controlled riot.
 

00:43:10.869 --> 00:43:13.570
However, Lord North was
dumbfounded because he really

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:16.114
thought he had given the
colonies what he called a

00:43:16.114 --> 00:43:18.659
"relief"
instead of an oppression,

00:43:18.659 --> 00:43:21.739
and he assumed that only what
he called,

00:43:21.739 --> 00:43:23.990
quote, "New England
fanatics"

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.480
would have rebelled against his
measure.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.079
So this event,
this tea event in Boston,

00:43:31.079 --> 00:43:34.670
is proof to him that the issue
no longer is one of taxation but

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:38.088
now this appears to him to be
more about whether Britain had

00:43:38.088 --> 00:43:40.943
any authority over,
quote, "the haughty

00:43:40.943 --> 00:43:43.079
American republicans at
all."

00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:45.657
And this is an actual
transcription of part of the

00:43:45.657 --> 00:43:49.079
parliamentary debate over what
to do after this was discovered.

00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:52.414
North said,
"The Americans have tarred

00:43:52.414 --> 00:43:55.010
and feathered your subjects,
plundered your merchants,

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:57.782
burnt your ships,
denied all obedience to your

00:43:57.782 --> 00:44:00.815
laws and authority;
yet so clement and so long

00:44:00.815 --> 00:44:04.789
forbearing has our conduct been,
that is--it is incumbent on us

00:44:04.789 --> 00:44:06.969
now to take a different course.
 

00:44:06.969 --> 00:44:08.918
Whatever may be the
consequence, we must risk

00:44:08.918 --> 00:44:09.449
something.
 

00:44:09.449 --> 00:44:12.570
If we do not all is over."
 

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:15.639
And another Member of
Parliament said he thought,

00:44:15.639 --> 00:44:18.780
quote, "The town of Boston
ought to be knocked about their

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.150
ears and destroyed."
 

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.179
[laughter] Okay.
 

00:44:22.179 --> 00:44:25.114
"I am of opinion you will
never meet with that proper

00:44:25.114 --> 00:44:28.253
obedience to the laws of this
country until you have destroyed

00:44:28.253 --> 00:44:29.849
that nest of locusts."
 

00:44:29.849 --> 00:44:30.097
Okay.
 

00:44:30.097 --> 00:44:31.929
Boston is not popular in
Parliament.

00:44:31.929 --> 00:44:34.813
Another member said--we're
moving back in to arrogant

00:44:34.813 --> 00:44:38.342
British quotation territory--
Lord North could not do "a

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:41.510
better thing than to put an end
to their town meetings.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:44.836
I would not have a man of a
mercantile cast every day

00:44:44.836 --> 00:44:48.291
collecting him--themselves
together, and debating about

00:44:48.291 --> 00:44:49.699
political matters.
 

00:44:49.699 --> 00:44:52.525
I would have them follow their
occupations as merchants,

00:44:52.525 --> 00:44:55.710
and not consider themselves as
ministers of that country....

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:57.447
You have, Sir,
no government,

00:44:57.447 --> 00:44:59.851
no governor,
the whole are the proceedings

00:44:59.851 --> 00:45:01.730
of a tumultuous and riotous
rabble,

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:04.239
who ought, if they had the
least prudence,

00:45:04.239 --> 00:45:06.599
to follow their mercantile
employment,

00:45:06.599 --> 00:45:09.889
and not trouble themselves with
politics and government,

00:45:09.889 --> 00:45:12.050
which they do not
understand."

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.893
[laughs]
Okay.

00:45:12.893 --> 00:45:15.300
Go back to your regular jobs,
guys.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.119
Don't mess in government.
 

00:45:17.119 --> 00:45:18.619
What are they doing?
 

00:45:18.619 --> 00:45:20.099
Why are they doing this?
 

00:45:20.099 --> 00:45:21.059
They're merchants.
 

00:45:21.059 --> 00:45:22.860
They're not politicians,
and look what they're doing.

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.309
They're messing up the imperial
system.

00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.643
Okay.
 

00:45:25.643 --> 00:45:29.382
The result of that kind of
sentiment would be the passage

00:45:29.382 --> 00:45:33.389
of four acts that Americans
termed the Intolerable Acts,

00:45:33.389 --> 00:45:39.018
passed in Parliament in the
spring of 1774.

00:45:39.018 --> 00:45:43.340
And I'm so on the cusp of
running out of time.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:47.302
I think what I will do is pause
there since we're just about out

00:45:47.302 --> 00:45:48.559
of time for class.
 

00:45:48.559 --> 00:45:50.018
We will continue.
 

00:45:50.018 --> 00:45:54.407
We will add the details of the
Intolerable Acts and then move

00:45:54.407 --> 00:45:58.654
in to the logic of resistance,
which is going to look at how

00:45:58.654 --> 00:46:02.639
this is adding up to an ongoing
logic in the colonial mindset.

00:46:02.639 --> 00:46:04.300
I'll stop there.
 

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:10.000

PAUL FREEDMAN: So
welcome to History 210, The

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.133
Early Middle Ages.

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm Paul Freedman.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.033
And behind this innocuous
title "The

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:11.967
Early Middle Ages"--

00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:14.167
I think we're going to have
to jazz it up a little.

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:17.233
I think we're going to put an
exclamation mark on it, at

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:21.167
least. But behind this innocuous
title, you will see,

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:27.067
I hope, if you stay for this
course, a strange course.

00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:33.533
Strange, not because it covers
the particular period 250 to

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:39.100
1000, but because it starts
out very recognizable, and

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.667
gets stranger and stranger, and
seems to dissolve into a

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:47.033
kind of a hard to grasp world.

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:48.300
Hard to grasp, but fun.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.833
I will talk about both the
strangeness and the fun

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:54.300
aspects in more detail.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.167
There are several great themes
in this span of centuries: the

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:04.100
fall of the Roman Empire; its
survival in the East, as the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.600
Byzantine Empire; the so-called
barbarian invasions

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.433
and kingdoms, set up on the
ruins of the Roman Empire; the

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:16.600
triumph of Christianity, which
went from being an outlawed

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.033
minority religion to the
established faith of the Roman

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:23.267
Empire; and then survived
the extinction

00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:25.700
of the Roman Empire.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.600
We have two Teaching Fellows:
Lauren Mancia, sitting at this

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.100
end, and Agnieszka Rec standing
in that corner.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.467
So far, there are sections
scheduled for Wednesday at 4

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.300
o'clock and Friday at 10:30.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.867
We'll probably have two
other sections.

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:51.833
We'll see how large the
class is next week.

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:55.267
Let me know if those
two section times--

00:01:55.267 --> 00:01:58.467
well, probably, the sections
to be added would be on

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.700
Thursday: Thursday afternoon,
and Thursday evening.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.033
Let me know if you have some
special problem in terms of

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:08.967
the scheduling of
the sections.

00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:14.300
As I said, when some of you were
already here, I'll have

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.533
some pauses, so that if you are
shopping and want to look

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:23.733
at another course, it'll be, if
not easy, at least possible

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:30.233
for you to get up and leave.
So I'll have several pauses

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.167
during the presentation.

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:37.467
But, I should say, I do want
to give a full class

00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:39.800
discussion today, or
presentation today.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.400
We only have so many

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.067
opportunities to discuss things.

00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:45.433
And I'd like to set
the scene for you.

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:50.300
And I think that will also help
you decide about taking

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.133
this course.

00:02:52.133 --> 00:03:01.333
Now, this course is part of the
Yale Open Courses Program.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:05.033
And, as you probably know,
there are lots of--

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:09.200
well, a select number, but a
substantial number, of courses

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.200
that are offered free to the
public via the Internet.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.567
And this is one of them
for the fall.

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:22.233
And I take this opportunity to
greet our Internet students

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:26.033
and Internet friends.

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:31.367
So since it's part of this
project, a Yale University

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:37.033
broadcast team will be recording
all the classes.

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:41.333
And they'll be as unobtrusive
as possible.

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:44.467
The classroom experience will be
essentially as it would be

00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:47.867
if they're not there.

00:03:47.867 --> 00:03:54.933
And it's their intention to
videotape me, and not you, so

00:03:54.933 --> 00:04:00.567
neither your faces nor voices
are supposed to appear.

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:04.767
Your questions are unlikely
to be heard.

00:04:04.767 --> 00:04:09.767
I will repeat the questions, so
that people watching this

00:04:09.767 --> 00:04:12.467
on the Internet will
have an idea.

00:04:12.467 --> 00:04:15.700
And I do encourage questions,
both things that you haven't

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.533
understood or things
for elucidation.

00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:22.400
I have a slightly more formal
lecture style than some

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.933
people, perhaps.

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:29.600
I try to have a reasonably
structured lecture that

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.600
doesn't wander off too much.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.133
Some of you have taken courses
from me and know I have

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:40.433
certain themes, or
preoccupations, or diversions.

00:04:40.433 --> 00:04:45.333
But I'm going to try to be as
coherent as possible, partly

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:47.467
because we are filming.

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:53.967
So I hope that you're
enthusiastic about the fact

00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:56.567
that we are participating in
this Yale Open Courses

00:04:56.567 --> 00:04:57.667
initiative.

00:04:57.667 --> 00:05:00.567
And, having said that, now you
should just think it away.

00:05:05.933 --> 00:05:08.600
The broadcast team is not
very conspicuous.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.733
And the objective is for us to
interact in the classroom as

00:05:11.733 --> 00:05:12.933
we normally would.

00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:19.000
And this is part of the unique
experience of teaching and

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.133
learning at Yale, so don't
hesitate to ask me if you have

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:25.300
any questions or concerns.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.767
The syllabus, you all
have copies of

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:28.867
the syllabus, I believe.

00:05:28.867 --> 00:05:34.233
And, of course, you'll have
seen it on the server.

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:36.833
The books are at Yale
Bookstore, and

00:05:36.833 --> 00:05:40.333
they are all there.

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:41.867
I hope there will be
enough copies; if

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.500
not, we will get more.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.800
The first assignment is,
conveniently in this sense,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.300
from the course pack.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.800
The course pack is at
TYCO, the photocopy

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.433
place on Elm Street.

00:05:55.433 --> 00:06:01.600
If you don't know where
that is let us know.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.333
And the assignments for Monday
and Wednesday, those first two

00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:11.833
assignments are from Peter
Brown's The World of Late

00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:16.000
Antiquity and A. H. M. Jones'
Constantine and the Conversion

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.433
of Western Europe.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.800
Questions so far?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.300
Right.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.767
OK.

00:06:24.767 --> 00:06:27.767
So the requirements that you
see on the syllabus are a

00:06:27.767 --> 00:06:31.733
short paper that's due
October the 10th.

00:06:31.733 --> 00:06:37.533
A mid-term, that will be held
in class October 17th.

00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:42.767
And a long paper, which
is due December 5th.

00:06:42.767 --> 00:06:45.067
That long paper is
a research paper.

00:06:45.067 --> 00:06:48.433
And we'll be glad to help you
choose a topic, offer you

00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:51.267
suggestions, help you
get started on that.

00:06:53.933 --> 00:07:01.567
It's 15 to 20 pages, and it
counts for 40% of your grade.

00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:08.200
The mid-term counts 30% of the
grade; the short paper 20%,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.600
and your section grade is 10%.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.100
Now, this course does not have
onerous requirements.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.267
But I expect you to do the
requirements that we have.

00:07:22.267 --> 00:07:25.633
There's no final exam.

00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:30.633
I urge you to blot out of your
mind the temptation not to do

00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:33.500
the reading because there's no
final exam, or the reading of

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.633
the second part of the course.

00:07:35.633 --> 00:07:38.600
And if we think that this is a
problem, judging on the basis

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.533
of how the sections go, we
reserve the possibility of

00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:45.400
giving you quizzes in the
section in the section

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:45.667
[correction: second]

00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:50.567
half of the course.

00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:53.933
Paper times, I'm going
to be firm on this.

00:07:53.933 --> 00:07:56.933
I can't say absolutely no
extensions on the paper,

00:07:56.933 --> 00:07:59.833
because I acknowledge the
existence of overwhelming

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:01.400
emergencies.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.567
But let me give you an example
of an excuse that's not going

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:07.633
to be accepted: "I have
three other papers

00:08:07.633 --> 00:08:10.300
due that week." OK?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.567
Plan in advance.

00:08:11.567 --> 00:08:12.967
We are at your disposal.

00:08:12.967 --> 00:08:17.300
If you want to plan your final
paper tomorrow, hey, this

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.667
afternoon, talk to me.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:24.533
I'm eager to hear from
you about that.

00:08:24.533 --> 00:08:29.533
In the sections, we don't want
you to bring laptops.

00:08:29.533 --> 00:08:33.267
And the reason for that is, not
that we think you're going

00:08:33.267 --> 00:08:38.000
to be Facebooking or answering
your email, because we know

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.533
that you never do that.

00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:44.800
The laptops, in our experience,
interfere with the

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.967
purpose of the section,
which is partly to

00:08:46.967 --> 00:08:48.267
talk to each other.

00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:52.533
And rather than focusing on
the screen, and then, in a

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:56.300
sense, being a series, of
archipelago of little islands,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.733
rather than a section, in the
sense of give and take and

00:08:59.733 --> 00:09:00.467
interchange.

00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:03.433
If you think that that imposes
some kind of hardship on you,

00:09:03.433 --> 00:09:08.167
I think you'll find that
it is pleasant.

00:09:08.167 --> 00:09:14.200
And if there's some technical
hardship, let me know.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.933
So logistical questions?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.500
Questions about the organization
in the course, or

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.533
any other aspect of this?

00:09:24.533 --> 00:09:27.000
Good, that means that
I'm clearer

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.767
than on some occasions.

00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:40.300
So, if anybody wants to leave
now, this is one opportunity.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:44.200
But, since it looks like I have
your attention riveted,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.967
let me introduce the course in
terms of its actual content.

00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:53.967
We are beginning by looking
at the crisis

00:09:53.967 --> 00:09:55.500
of the Roman Empire.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.533
And then we will be looking
at its peculiar legacy.

00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:03.267
In the year 1000, where we stop,
we will still be dealing

00:10:03.267 --> 00:10:08.367
with The Inheritance of the
Roman Empire, the title of

00:10:08.367 --> 00:10:10.433
Chris Wickham's book, one of the
books that we're going to

00:10:10.433 --> 00:10:13.467
be using a lot.

00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:17.233
The legacy is peculiar because,
while the memory of

00:10:17.233 --> 00:10:22.233
the Roman Empire remains intact
throughout the period,

00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:23.000
and beyond--

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.100
I mean, to this day, the
head of the Catholic

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.400
Church is in Rome.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:35.133
Until 1960, the transactions of
the papacy were in Latin:

00:10:35.133 --> 00:10:38.467
the services of the Church were
in Latin, the Catholic

00:10:38.467 --> 00:10:39.733
Church were in Latin.

00:10:39.733 --> 00:10:44.133
And Latin remains the official
language of the Catholic

00:10:44.133 --> 00:10:46.633
church in its administrative
head.

00:10:46.633 --> 00:10:53.033
So the most faithful preserver
of Rome and its legacy,

00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:57.133
historically, is the
Catholic Church.

00:10:57.133 --> 00:11:00.967
And this is a paradox because
the Church begins its career,

00:11:00.967 --> 00:11:05.133
and, indeed, its first
250 years, as illegal

00:11:05.133 --> 00:11:06.300
in the Roman empire.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.633
And, indeed, there are periodic
persecutions where

00:11:08.633 --> 00:11:13.533
people were punished, including
killed, because they

00:11:13.533 --> 00:11:14.800
were Christian.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.367
The most faithful preserver of
Rome, however, after the fifth

00:11:21.367 --> 00:11:24.700
century collapse of the Empire
in the West, is the so-called

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.700
Byzantine Empire--

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.067
the Byzantine Empire with
its headquarters in

00:11:31.067 --> 00:11:32.300
Constantinople.

00:11:34.267 --> 00:11:37.533
Despite the fact that it would
abandon Latin for Greek in the

00:11:37.533 --> 00:11:40.567
sixth century and turn into
a very different kind of

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:45.867
political and cultural entity,
the Byzantine Empire went down

00:11:45.867 --> 00:11:53.400
in flames to the Turks in 1453
still as the Roman Empire.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.867
That was its official
name to the end.

00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:05.433
Another heir to the Roman
Empire, in a sense, is Islam,

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:08.500
which begins in the seventh
century, in the

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.267
middle of our period.

00:12:10.267 --> 00:12:12.900
I don't have to emphasize
to you the historical

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.100
importance of Islam.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.367
But our task is to understand
its origin and its astonishing

00:12:20.367 --> 00:12:27.333
expansion in terms of this
era, 250 to 1000.

00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:30.733
To understand it in terms of
its times, and thus how it

00:12:30.733 --> 00:12:37.000
arises and interacts with the
Roman and Byzantine as well

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.267
as, offstage, the Persian,
Empires that it either

00:12:41.267 --> 00:12:45.667
destroys or weakens in the
seventh and eighth centuries.

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:49.433
Mohammed was from outside the
former empire, from Arabia,

00:12:49.433 --> 00:12:51.567
and may be said to represent
a very different

00:12:51.567 --> 00:12:53.900
kind of set of ideas.

00:12:58.233 --> 00:13:02.367
But the power of Islam would,
for centuries, be concentrated

00:13:02.367 --> 00:13:06.667
in areas of the former Roman
Empire: the Mediterranean, the

00:13:06.667 --> 00:13:09.133
Balkans, Egypt, Syria,
North Africa.

00:13:09.133 --> 00:13:13.233
Of course, in the latter, it
still is the overwhelming

00:13:13.233 --> 00:13:14.467
majority religion.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.767
And Islam then brings up a sort
of question that I'm not

00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:26.167
going to deal with directly very
much, but that will be at

00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:29.367
the back of our minds, and
that is relevance.

00:13:29.367 --> 00:13:32.167
This is a pre-industrial course;
it's in the very

00:13:32.167 --> 00:13:35.533
pre-industrial category in
terms of requirements.

00:13:35.533 --> 00:13:37.967
It's far away; it's distant.

00:13:37.967 --> 00:13:40.933
That is part of its appeal,
I think, is as I said, its

00:13:40.933 --> 00:13:42.867
strangeness.

00:13:42.867 --> 00:13:46.000
But the lessons from the
material covered in this

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.100
course are perhaps these--

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.733
worth thinking about.

00:13:52.267 --> 00:13:56.267
How, perhaps the most
successful, multi-cultural

00:13:56.267 --> 00:14:02.800
empire of Western history, how
it did that, how it endured

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.733
for so long.

00:14:03.733 --> 00:14:07.200
The success of the
Roman Empire and

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.067
why it finally failed.

00:14:10.067 --> 00:14:15.367
And in that failure, how
does a rich, literate,

00:14:15.367 --> 00:14:21.667
well-developed society come
to be destroyed by a more

00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:22.733
primitive one?

00:14:22.733 --> 00:14:26.500
Primitive, at least, in the
sense of material culture,

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.133
economic complexity,
urbanization, and literacy.

00:14:33.333 --> 00:14:38.933
Another important lesson is the
power of religious ideas,

00:14:38.933 --> 00:14:44.967
not only intrinsically as part
of people's lives and outlook,

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:51.000
but socially and historically:
how religion affects the

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.533
political course of history.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.333
Having said this, I think I did
mention, I was going to

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:04.000
tell you what was fun
about this course.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.500
This is what I think is fun,
and I've already kind of

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.000
alluded to this.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.567
We begin with a familiar world,
in the sense that the

00:15:13.567 --> 00:15:16.233
Roman Empire, although obviously
not technologically

00:15:16.233 --> 00:15:20.000
the same as the one we live in,
is a very advanced society

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and a very complex one.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.400
Advanced?

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.267
Well, go to Europe and look
around, and see the

00:15:26.267 --> 00:15:28.300
engineering feats
of the Romans.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:35.633
See the public life that the
baths, stadia, temples, law

00:15:35.633 --> 00:15:42.400
courts, marketplaces, whose
ruins still, in many

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.267
instances, dwarf the towns that
survived around them.

00:15:47.267 --> 00:15:50.933
See what an accomplishment
that is.

00:15:50.933 --> 00:15:56.433
It is a huge empire, a
bureaucratic empire, one with

00:15:56.433 --> 00:16:01.533
lots of literate people, a
huge army, a huge civil

00:16:01.533 --> 00:16:05.500
service, a lot of commerce back
and forth, all things

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.367
that are familiar to us.

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:15.233
But as it weakens and collapses,
you get a kind of,

00:16:15.233 --> 00:16:19.633
if not post-apocalyptic,
at least transformative

00:16:19.633 --> 00:16:20.900
experience.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.500
It gets stranger and stranger,
more and more disorganized,

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.033
harder to understand
at first grasp.

00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:35.267
Basically we begin in the Shire
and we end up in more

00:16:35.267 --> 00:16:37.167
dangerous territories.

00:16:37.167 --> 00:16:40.667
It's hard to describe the
territory that we end up in,

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:46.633
but that is what I think is
intriguing about the course.

00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:52.033
You start out in a familiar
world, and it just becomes

00:16:52.033 --> 00:16:55.667
something alien, but,
I think, appealing.

00:16:55.667 --> 00:16:58.033
Appealing, but I do have
one warning for you.

00:16:58.033 --> 00:17:05.300
Or one thing that I have seen
students surprised at, and

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.567
sometimes even annoyed at.

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:11.567
And that is, we've got to talk
about religion: both

00:17:11.567 --> 00:17:17.367
Christianity and Islam, and,
to a more limited extent,

00:17:17.367 --> 00:17:20.433
Judaism, and also paganism,
for that matter.

00:17:20.433 --> 00:17:22.600
But the one that tends to bother
people actually is

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.767
Christianity.

00:17:23.767 --> 00:17:27.000
So sometimes people will say,
I thought I was taking a

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.167
History course, and this
turned into a Religious

00:17:29.167 --> 00:17:31.500
Studies course before my eyes.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.833
We're going to have to talk
about some heresies.

00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:37.133
You're going to have to
understand, actually, what

00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:39.600
people are fighting and killing
each other over, when

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.333
they talk about the nature of
Christ, or the relationship

00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:45.533
among the three persons
of the Trinity.

00:17:45.533 --> 00:17:48.733
This is unfamiliar, but, again,
I think unfamiliarity

00:17:48.733 --> 00:17:50.200
is good for us.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.833
And unfamiliarity has a funny
way of turning into familiar.

00:17:53.833 --> 00:17:56.733
When I started teaching--

00:17:56.733 --> 00:17:59.567
well, dinosaurs weren't walking
the earth, but they'd

00:17:59.567 --> 00:18:04.633
just departed, primitive birds
and early mammals--

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.667
the assumption was that
religion was safely--

00:18:10.667 --> 00:18:12.667
religion as a political
movement, not religion as a

00:18:12.667 --> 00:18:18.033
personal commitment, but
religion as something that had

00:18:18.033 --> 00:18:21.367
an impact on politics was pretty
safely gone, and that

00:18:21.367 --> 00:18:24.133
it was a feature of
medieval history.

00:18:24.133 --> 00:18:29.300
Obviously the last years have
shown us, in many ways, the

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.100
power of religious ideas.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:36.633
The power of religious ideas,
not solely personally, but

00:18:36.633 --> 00:18:40.667
collectively; not solely
as sentiments, but

00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:41.900
as political movements.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.867
So we begin with the crisis of
the Empire, the first crisis

00:18:49.867 --> 00:18:51.867
of the Empire in the
third century AD.

00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:57.300
If we go back just
before that--

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.433
this isn't officially part of
the course, this is like the

00:18:59.433 --> 00:19:03.833
chef offers you this little
amuse-bouche, this little

00:19:03.833 --> 00:19:06.700
snack to begin the meal.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.567
The period of the Good Emperors,
the second century

00:19:08.567 --> 00:19:12.367
AD-- the term the Good Emperor
is a term popularized by the

00:19:12.367 --> 00:19:16.600
great historian of The Decline
and Fall of The Roman Empire,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.900
Edward Gibbon, who wrote
in the 18th century.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.667
And it's one of those works
that, whatever its myriad

00:19:21.667 --> 00:19:25.467
factual and interpretive
inaccuracies, still sets the

00:19:25.467 --> 00:19:29.333
program for how we look at the
decadence and collapse of the

00:19:29.333 --> 00:19:30.533
Roman Empire.

00:19:30.533 --> 00:19:34.967
Gibbon says, "If a man were
called upon to fix the period

00:19:34.967 --> 00:19:38.133
in history of the world during
which the condition of the

00:19:38.133 --> 00:19:41.467
human race was most happy and
prosperous, he would, without

00:19:41.467 --> 00:19:45.300
hesitation, name that which
elapsed from the accession of

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.800
Nerva to the death of Marcus
Aurelius," that

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.300
is, 96 to 180 AD.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.233
He goes on, "Their united reigns
are possibly the only

00:19:56.233 --> 00:20:00.200
period in which the happiness of
a great people was the sole

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.567
object of government." So it's
this period of the so-called

00:20:05.567 --> 00:20:09.367
Good Emperors against which the
subsequent decline traced

00:20:09.367 --> 00:20:15.767
in Gibbon's monumental work
would take place.

00:20:15.767 --> 00:20:18.567
Now, as opposed to Gibbon, we're
not so confident that

00:20:18.567 --> 00:20:20.833
the Roman Empire was
so wonderful

00:20:20.833 --> 00:20:22.167
for everybody involved.

00:20:22.167 --> 00:20:23.633
We have a somewhat
more egalitarian

00:20:23.633 --> 00:20:24.867
outlook than Gibbon.

00:20:24.867 --> 00:20:27.200
Gibbon never says, oh, well,
what about the slaves?

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.400
Or what about the peasant, or
hey, the position of the women

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.767
in society?

00:20:33.767 --> 00:20:38.200
But more than that, I think we
have some more doubt and

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.033
hesitation as to whether any
state, particularly any

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:47.433
powerful state, necessarily
represents a standard of

00:20:47.433 --> 00:20:49.933
virtue or happiness.

00:20:49.933 --> 00:20:52.800
For the poor, the smooth
functioning of the Roman

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.300
government was less important
than it was for

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.833
the propertied classes.

00:20:56.833 --> 00:21:01.267
Because the Roman state, like
most states, in so far as it

00:21:01.267 --> 00:21:05.633
practiced the rule of law, was
set up to guarantee property,

00:21:05.633 --> 00:21:06.900
not rights.

00:21:09.667 --> 00:21:13.167
And you'll see Wickham, when
we come to read him, he

00:21:13.167 --> 00:21:17.900
emphasizes, in the chapter on
the burden of rule in the

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.933
Roman Empire--

00:21:20.933 --> 00:21:23.300
this is for September 19th--

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.400
the Roman Empire was
not organized to

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.533
reward ordinary people.

00:21:28.533 --> 00:21:33.233
To different degrees, and at
varying times, it did rely on

00:21:33.233 --> 00:21:34.133
slave labor.

00:21:34.133 --> 00:21:35.667
This is easy to exaggerate.

00:21:35.667 --> 00:21:38.700
It's not a slave society.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.700
It's not an overwhelmingly
slave-owning society, but

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:48.867
certainly many of its
enterprises involved slavery.

00:21:48.867 --> 00:21:52.967
Its laws were designed to
protect the property of the

00:21:52.967 --> 00:21:56.333
wealthy, rather than to mete
out equal justice.

00:21:56.333 --> 00:21:59.100
Rome was an imperial power,
and, as I will say in a

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.867
moment, it was an
extraordinarily tolerant one.

00:22:03.867 --> 00:22:06.667
But it was tolerant as long as
you conformed to their image

00:22:06.667 --> 00:22:07.600
of civilization.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.467
Like many great imperial powers,
it assumed that there

00:22:12.467 --> 00:22:15.433
were certain areas of life
that were optional.

00:22:15.433 --> 00:22:16.933
They were very tolerant
with regard to

00:22:16.933 --> 00:22:19.067
religion, for example.

00:22:19.067 --> 00:22:21.300
But their definition
of civilization

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.867
was being like us.

00:22:24.867 --> 00:22:26.367
They were generous about that.

00:22:26.367 --> 00:22:29.633
They would make citizens of
people from the Celtic lands

00:22:29.633 --> 00:22:33.667
of Britain to Egypt.

00:22:33.667 --> 00:22:37.200
But this meant conforming to
a certain set of standards,

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.333
beliefs, assumptions,
and a way of life.

00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:49.833
Another thing that we now would
dissent from Gibbon

00:22:49.833 --> 00:22:52.733
about is the efficiency
of the Roman Empire.

00:22:52.733 --> 00:22:54.967
To Gibbon, in the 18th century,
the Roman Empire

00:22:54.967 --> 00:22:57.300
appeared a marvel
of efficiency.

00:22:59.867 --> 00:23:02.467
But really, how could
it be efficient?

00:23:02.467 --> 00:23:07.867
The distances were so long,
and travel was so slow.

00:23:07.867 --> 00:23:13.167
This is an empire that took
weeks and weeks to traverse in

00:23:13.167 --> 00:23:15.467
the state of communications.

00:23:15.467 --> 00:23:20.000
And we know, from contemporary
times that, even with great

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.633
communications, indeed, with
instantaneous communications,

00:23:23.633 --> 00:23:27.067
it's very hard to hold
states together.

00:23:27.067 --> 00:23:29.467
And, in fact, one of the things
that's happened in the

00:23:29.467 --> 00:23:33.033
last 50 years is the
weakening of the

00:23:33.033 --> 00:23:34.733
state, strangely enough.

00:23:34.733 --> 00:23:37.667
Strangely, because what people
thought was going to happen is

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:39.700
what had been going on in the
20th century generally.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.433
States had become more and more
powerful, more and more

00:23:42.433 --> 00:23:47.133
dictatorial, more and
more tyrannical.

00:23:47.133 --> 00:23:51.467
And, indeed, George Orwell's
1984, written in the post-war

00:23:51.467 --> 00:23:55.433
era in the late 1940s, assumes
that totalitarianism is what's

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:57.167
going to be generalized.

00:23:57.167 --> 00:23:59.200
In fact, it turns out
that the problem is

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.733
not so much the state--

00:24:02.733 --> 00:24:05.833
look at the great states of the
mid-20th century: one no

00:24:05.833 --> 00:24:08.900
longer exists, the Soviet Union,
and the other, the

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.133
United States--

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.533
whatever our strengths are--
it doesn't seem to be the

00:24:16.533 --> 00:24:18.633
extraordinary power of the
central government, which is,

00:24:18.633 --> 00:24:24.433
in fact, much reduced from what
is was in, say, 1950, by

00:24:24.433 --> 00:24:26.367
any measurement.

00:24:26.367 --> 00:24:28.533
So we have a different
idea of the state.

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:33.167
We're more aware of the
limitations of state power in

00:24:33.167 --> 00:24:34.033
past times.

00:24:34.033 --> 00:24:36.600
We're more aware of the
discrepancy between the

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:42.367
rhetoric of power-- and no
polity equals the Roman Empire

00:24:42.367 --> 00:24:47.500
for its ceremonies of power, its
architecture of power, its

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.767
culture of power.

00:24:51.033 --> 00:24:54.267
But the emperor, in fact,
however glorious, however much

00:24:54.267 --> 00:24:57.700
in the third century was
worshiped as a god, his power

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.133
was limited.

00:24:59.133 --> 00:25:01.033
His power was limited
in terms of

00:25:01.033 --> 00:25:04.267
enforcement, if not in theory.

00:25:04.267 --> 00:25:07.500
And this will be important
because, right from the start,

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.367
we're going to assess the
accomplishments of the Emperor

00:25:09.367 --> 00:25:12.867
Diocletian, at the end of third
century, and the Emperor

00:25:12.867 --> 00:25:16.200
Constantine, beginning of the
fourth century, who may be

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.533
said to have saved the
empire from collapse.

00:25:19.533 --> 00:25:23.900
The thing about the Roman Empire
that is indisputable,

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.733
and does not have a value
judgment attached to it, is

00:25:26.733 --> 00:25:29.200
that it was enduring.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.500
The Roman Empire lasted
for an incredibly long

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.800
time; it was stable.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:43.867
In the year 410 the Visigoths
sacked, plundered Rome.

00:25:43.867 --> 00:25:47.533
They entered the city of Rome,
this so-called barbarian

00:25:47.533 --> 00:25:49.567
tribe, and they pillaged it.

00:25:49.567 --> 00:25:52.967
They pillaged it in a fairly
orderly way, but,

00:25:52.967 --> 00:25:55.400
nevertheless, they
pillaged it.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.967
This was the first time this
had happened in the city of

00:25:58.967 --> 00:26:05.333
Rome in something on the
order of 800 years.

00:26:05.333 --> 00:26:08.600
The Empire itself,
by this time, was

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.900
nearly 400 years old.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.133
The other indisputable
accomplishment of the Roman

00:26:18.133 --> 00:26:22.200
Empire is that it controlled
the Mediterranean.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:27.000
The Mediterranean was its
center, referred to often as

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.767
Mare Nostrum, as our sea.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.367
Our sea because they controlled
all of the

00:26:41.367 --> 00:26:42.667
shoreline of the
Mediterranean--

00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:47.400
the only power that has
ever done that.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.333
There have been great empires:
the Ottoman Empire, the

00:26:50.333 --> 00:26:56.267
Byzantine Empire, the Caliphate,
but none of them

00:26:56.267 --> 00:27:01.767
controlled more than
about 40% of the

00:27:01.767 --> 00:27:04.200
Mediterranean at any one time.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.433
So even if we dissent from
Gibbon's calm assurance that

00:27:10.433 --> 00:27:12.533
the best period of human history
was the era of the

00:27:12.533 --> 00:27:15.367
Good Emperors in the second
century AD, we shouldn't

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:17.400
minimize the accomplishments
of this

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.833
empire and of this era.

00:27:19.833 --> 00:27:23.933
To live in security, with
respect to both outside

00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:30.600
enemies and internal disorder,
essentially peace and the rule

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.333
of law, was unusual.

00:27:33.333 --> 00:27:37.067
And, unfortunately,
it remains so.

00:27:37.067 --> 00:27:38.633
Rome was an immense empire.

00:27:38.633 --> 00:27:41.600
It stretched from England
to the Sahara,

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.367
from Spain to Armenia.

00:27:44.367 --> 00:27:48.467
It had a common language of
administration, Latin.

00:27:48.467 --> 00:27:51.867
And two cultural languages,
Greek and Latin, understood by

00:27:51.867 --> 00:27:57.300
the elite from one end of
the empire to the other.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:02.233
The cities were not walled
until the third century.

00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:05.033
Gibbon, in particular,
emphasizes the tolerance of

00:28:05.033 --> 00:28:08.567
Rome, which appealed to his
innate anti-clericalism.

00:28:08.567 --> 00:28:12.933
And, as many of you know, his
explanation for the fall of

00:28:12.933 --> 00:28:15.467
the Empire was Christianity.

00:28:15.467 --> 00:28:19.167
It was Christianity that
weakened the Empire, weakened

00:28:19.167 --> 00:28:24.067
its elite, turns its attention
to foolish controversies over

00:28:24.067 --> 00:28:27.533
Trinitarian or Christological
concerns, when they should

00:28:27.533 --> 00:28:30.533
have been concentrating
on the barbarians.

00:28:30.533 --> 00:28:35.933
This is not accepted anymore,
for reasons that will become

00:28:35.933 --> 00:28:40.200
clearer in these first
few weeks.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.000
And its appeal though, the idea
of toleration, is very

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.500
important to Gibbon, writing
in the 18th century, when

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.233
Europe had just emerged from
centuries of religious wars.

00:28:51.233 --> 00:28:53.267
Having seen the wars of the
Reformation, well not

00:28:53.267 --> 00:28:55.567
literally, he hadn't lived
through them, but being the

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:59.467
inheritor of these religious
wars, of the Thirty Years War

00:28:59.467 --> 00:29:02.667
in Germany in the 17th
century, of religious

00:29:02.667 --> 00:29:08.133
controversy in Britain, Gibbon,
like many members of

00:29:08.133 --> 00:29:11.333
the Enlightenment generation he
was part of, thought that

00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:15.533
the world would be far better if
religion remained either an

00:29:15.533 --> 00:29:19.600
exclusively private matter
or just disappeared.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.733
So for him, the villain in
history, and in particular,

00:29:22.733 --> 00:29:26.967
the villain in Roman history
is religion.

00:29:26.967 --> 00:29:32.567
But, however tolerant, of
course, Rome drew the line at

00:29:32.567 --> 00:29:38.333
Christianity, for reasons
we shall discuss.

00:29:38.333 --> 00:29:42.000
But it is still, historically,
quite unusual that the Empire

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.833
should have permitted all of
these other religions.

00:29:45.833 --> 00:29:49.533
Indeed, rather than regarding,
say, the religions of Egypt as

00:29:49.533 --> 00:29:53.433
inferior, they simply brought
those gods in.

00:29:53.433 --> 00:29:55.667
Monday, you might
worship Zeus.

00:29:55.667 --> 00:29:59.633
And Tuesday, hey, if you wanted
to see if Isis was

00:29:59.633 --> 00:30:04.900
going to help you with your
impending business deal, why

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.467
not go and see an
Egyptian temple?

00:30:08.467 --> 00:30:09.533
So its eclectic.

00:30:09.533 --> 00:30:13.400
It's a little bit like the
way Americans dine out.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.633
It makes no sense to most
people, in most of the world,

00:30:16.633 --> 00:30:18.667
to say something like, "Oh, I
don't want Japanese food.

00:30:18.667 --> 00:30:22.667
I had that for lunch." If
you're in Japan you're

00:30:22.667 --> 00:30:25.200
expected to have Japanese food
for lunch and for dinner, and

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.267
the same with Italian food.

00:30:27.267 --> 00:30:30.167
The same is true of religion,
most people don't just say,

00:30:30.167 --> 00:30:31.967
"Oh, I don't want to go to
Presbyterian Church this

00:30:31.967 --> 00:30:35.633
weekend, I'm going to go worship
at a Buddhist temple,

00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:39.233
just for a change." This
is more in the

00:30:39.233 --> 00:30:41.800
nature of Roman religion.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.300
So this kind of tolerance
is unusual.

00:30:47.533 --> 00:30:51.033
So tolerance, tolerance is a
real virtue of the Empire,

00:30:51.033 --> 00:30:52.633
even if it's limited.

00:30:52.633 --> 00:30:55.233
Real virtue because it's
unusual, historically.

00:30:58.467 --> 00:30:59.900
Peace--

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:06.667
the Roman Empire spent half of
its state budget on the army.

00:31:06.667 --> 00:31:09.367
On the other hand, no empire
this large could be held

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:13.367
together by military
means alone.

00:31:13.367 --> 00:31:17.367
It was held together by an elite
that shared notions of

00:31:17.367 --> 00:31:21.233
civilization, that made certain
sacrifices for the

00:31:21.233 --> 00:31:22.633
public good.

00:31:22.633 --> 00:31:28.867
Those games, the circuses, the
competitions, the ceremonies

00:31:28.867 --> 00:31:31.733
were usually paid for by private
people, not by the

00:31:31.733 --> 00:31:33.000
state, for example.

00:31:36.933 --> 00:31:41.300
It is an urban civilization,
with an elite that is urban.

00:31:44.833 --> 00:31:49.267
The cities held their
local gods.

00:31:49.267 --> 00:31:52.033
They had local administration.

00:31:52.033 --> 00:31:56.000
They built aqueducts, temples,
law courts, all these edifices

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.367
that I mentioned earlier.

00:31:59.367 --> 00:32:02.567
It was a cosmopolitan
way of life.

00:32:02.567 --> 00:32:05.333
So it's diverse in the sense
that there are many different

00:32:05.333 --> 00:32:08.933
peoples, but unified, in the
sense that the elite shares a

00:32:08.933 --> 00:32:10.100
common language,

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.400
and even the city planning
is the same.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.367
If you went to London or you
went to Timgad, in what's now

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:19.033
the Algerian desert, you'd
know your way around.

00:32:19.033 --> 00:32:21.133
You'd know where to find
the marketplace.

00:32:21.133 --> 00:32:23.333
You'd know that it was
laid out in a grid.

00:32:23.333 --> 00:32:26.033
You'd know where the law courts
would be in relation to

00:32:26.033 --> 00:32:27.433
the temples.

00:32:27.433 --> 00:32:29.833
You could find your way, just
as if you get off the

00:32:29.833 --> 00:32:35.233
interstate, you know that there
will be a Wendy's or a

00:32:35.233 --> 00:32:38.700
Denny's or a Shell station.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:43.600
And it would be an exceptional
place that didn't have them.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.333
If you couldn't find a Home
Depot, even without benefit of

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:52.600
technical aids, getting off an
exit of the average interstate

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.533
highway then you don't live in
America, or you haven't been

00:32:55.533 --> 00:32:56.767
here very long.

00:32:56.767 --> 00:33:00.933
So the same thing, there's a
sort of a mental picture of

00:33:00.933 --> 00:33:02.967
what a city looks like,
from one end of the

00:33:02.967 --> 00:33:05.167
empire to the other.

00:33:07.933 --> 00:33:10.400
But it is an empire that
is centered around the

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.667
Mediterranean, and not just
logistically or politically,

00:33:13.667 --> 00:33:14.833
but culturally.

00:33:14.833 --> 00:33:19.000
For the Romans, their empire
included lands where olive

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.367
trees didn't grow, and where
wine grapes didn't flourish,

00:33:23.367 --> 00:33:26.033
but those places were not places
they wanted to live.

00:33:26.033 --> 00:33:30.567
They wanted to control them,
but they were beyond

00:33:30.567 --> 00:33:31.567
civilization.

00:33:31.567 --> 00:33:35.933
So a government official on
the Danube, in what's now

00:33:35.933 --> 00:33:38.833
Hungary, writes home complaining
that, quote, "The

00:33:38.833 --> 00:33:41.533
inhabitants lead the most
miserable of lives for they

00:33:41.533 --> 00:33:46.033
cultivate no olives and they
drink no wine, end of story.

00:33:46.033 --> 00:33:49.767
And you could imagine, there's
a certain kind of East Coast

00:33:49.767 --> 00:33:52.333
discourse on the order of, "They
have blueberry bagels

00:33:52.333 --> 00:33:58.033
out here, I can't live here."
Or, you know, the nearest

00:33:58.033 --> 00:34:04.433
Starbucks is 30 miles away,
and there's no substitute.

00:34:04.433 --> 00:34:05.567
This is an impressive
empire then.

00:34:05.567 --> 00:34:06.833
So, its flaws--

00:34:10.067 --> 00:34:15.200
it has an imbalance between the
urban and the rural, not

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.767
as great as historians once
thought, but it is dominated

00:34:17.767 --> 00:34:22.633
by cities that depend on
peasants, but that tend to

00:34:22.633 --> 00:34:26.267
drain the land of
its vitality.

00:34:26.267 --> 00:34:29.067
It's also imbalanced East-West.
Strangely enough,

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:33.500
for an empire that was founded
in the West, by the time we

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.033
start, the East is
more prosperous.

00:34:36.033 --> 00:34:37.300
It's more urban.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.433
It has more trade.

00:34:39.433 --> 00:34:42.700
It's better organized,
more commercial.

00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:50.233
Another flaw of this
empire is its size.

00:34:50.233 --> 00:34:53.100
It works for a long time, and
then, when it doesn't work,

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.633
this becomes a real problem.

00:34:55.633 --> 00:34:56.867
And then the army--

00:34:56.867 --> 00:35:01.233
the army in the third century
discovers that it can make and

00:35:01.233 --> 00:35:02.933
unmake emperors.

00:35:02.933 --> 00:35:06.067
So the immediate crisis of the
third century, which lasts

00:35:06.067 --> 00:35:11.667
from 235 to the accession of
Diocletian in 284, is that it

00:35:11.667 --> 00:35:14.233
has dozens and dozens
of emperors.

00:35:14.233 --> 00:35:16.867
Most reign for less
than three years.

00:35:16.867 --> 00:35:20.000
All but one die violently.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.733
So the two things are linked,
the power of the army to

00:35:22.733 --> 00:35:26.533
proclaim an emperor, and the
inability of that emperor to

00:35:26.533 --> 00:35:30.067
keep this power before the army
or an army somewhere, in

00:35:30.067 --> 00:35:35.100
one province or another, rises
up another emperor and kills

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.267
the former one.

00:35:38.267 --> 00:35:41.900
So it's a durable empire, but
an unwieldy, and in certain

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.733
respects, exhausted one.

00:35:45.733 --> 00:35:48.233
So in the first part of the
course, we're going to look at

00:35:48.233 --> 00:35:50.733
how this empire functioned.

00:35:50.733 --> 00:35:54.833
And we're going to look at
its two great crises.

00:35:54.833 --> 00:35:59.967
The first of them, this third
century crisis, which involves

00:35:59.967 --> 00:36:03.833
all these many different
emperors, also has invasions

00:36:03.833 --> 00:36:07.700
from Persia, also has the first
indications of barbarian

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.133
invasions across the frontier
of the Danube and the Rhine

00:36:11.133 --> 00:36:16.333
rivers, but it survives
this first crisis.

00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:19.300
And that is the accomplishment
of Diocletian, about whom

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.033
you're going to be reading.

00:36:21.033 --> 00:36:25.700
The second crisis, that of the
fifth century, is similar, in

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:32.900
many respects, but more
final in its results.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.067
The fifth century crisis
witnesses the collapse of the

00:36:36.067 --> 00:36:39.833
Roman Empire in the West, the
fall of the Roman Empire of

00:36:39.833 --> 00:36:43.767
Gibbon, that Gibbon made famous,
and that continues to

00:36:43.767 --> 00:36:48.367
inspire a certain amount of
fascination and fear today.

00:36:48.367 --> 00:36:53.300
So here are some questions that
should be in the back of

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.367
your mind, at least, while
you do this reading for

00:36:56.367 --> 00:36:57.333
the first few weeks.

00:36:57.333 --> 00:36:59.533
When we're talking about the
collapse or weakening of the

00:36:59.533 --> 00:37:02.833
Roman empire, did this happen
because of foreign threats or

00:37:02.833 --> 00:37:05.333
internal weakness?

00:37:05.333 --> 00:37:09.000
The rhetorical topos, and it's
often invoked with regard to

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.567
empires in the modern world,
is internal weakness.

00:37:13.567 --> 00:37:17.500
That's because the opponents
don't seem very savage or very

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.433
impressive.

00:37:19.433 --> 00:37:23.900
But it's not necessarily
a given.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:27.133
As I said before, external
enemies, even that don't

00:37:27.133 --> 00:37:31.067
appear to be that imposing,
can, under certain

00:37:31.067 --> 00:37:35.533
circumstances, impress their
will on what would seem to be

00:37:35.533 --> 00:37:36.967
a more powerful empire.

00:37:36.967 --> 00:37:38.433
To some extent that is, indeed,

00:37:38.433 --> 00:37:41.300
because of internal weakness.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.333
But it won't do to
exaggerate that.

00:37:43.333 --> 00:37:46.033
But this is one of
the problems.

00:37:46.033 --> 00:37:48.967
Another problem is continuity
versus change.

00:37:48.967 --> 00:37:51.333
The East survives.

00:37:51.333 --> 00:37:53.200
The East even flourishes
for a while.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.400
And even for a while seems
to be on the verge of

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.800
re-conquering the West
from the barbarians.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.633
So how can we talk about the
fall of the Roman Empire when,

00:38:01.633 --> 00:38:03.733
you know, only part
of it falls?

00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:10.933
Another question is, how did
the rise of Christianity

00:38:10.933 --> 00:38:12.733
affect the political
and cultural

00:38:12.733 --> 00:38:14.367
fortunes of the Empire?

00:38:14.367 --> 00:38:17.833
As I said, Gibbon said it
affected its fortunes by

00:38:17.833 --> 00:38:19.333
destroying it.

00:38:19.333 --> 00:38:22.500
But beyond that, I think, over
simple explanation, how did

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.167
Christianity change
the Empire?

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.200
Was this change a catastrophe
or a transformation?

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.767
And, how did Christianity
triumph?

00:38:35.767 --> 00:38:40.133
It seems to be so alien
to everything Roman.

00:38:40.133 --> 00:38:44.400
How does it become the official

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.833
religion of the Empire?

00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:47.300
And, how does it
become, indeed,

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.733
identified with the Empire?

00:38:51.733 --> 00:38:53.900
All of these questions are
currently very much debated by

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.633
historians.

00:38:54.633 --> 00:38:56.633
I'm not going to have a
definitive answer for you.

00:38:56.633 --> 00:38:57.967
I've certain opinions.

00:38:57.967 --> 00:39:02.467
I'll present the information
basically in accord with that,

00:39:02.467 --> 00:39:07.467
but this is not something that
has been scientifically proven

00:39:07.467 --> 00:39:11.300
or received universal
acknowledgement.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.633
So we begin this course with
the reign of the Emperor

00:39:13.633 --> 00:39:16.500
Diocletian, 284 to 305.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.733
And we do this because he solved
a number of problems

00:39:19.733 --> 00:39:22.167
which threatened the survival
of the Empire

00:39:22.167 --> 00:39:23.400
in the third century.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:30.067
These problems, as I said,
instability of rule, Persian

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:34.067
invasion, barbarian invasions,
and then, one I didn't

00:39:34.067 --> 00:39:37.033
mention, which is inflation,
tremendous economic

00:39:37.033 --> 00:39:38.267
dislocation.

00:39:40.367 --> 00:39:43.167
All of these are manifestations
of the

00:39:43.167 --> 00:39:45.667
long-term flaws I
just mentioned.

00:39:45.667 --> 00:39:47.233
The thing about long-term
flaws--

00:39:47.233 --> 00:39:50.800
I mean, you can point to
long-term flaws in the Soviet

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.833
Empire or long-term flaws
in the British Empire.

00:39:54.833 --> 00:39:57.533
But why do they manifest
themselves when they do?

00:39:57.533 --> 00:40:01.133
Or, to put it another way, why
does the empire go on and

00:40:01.133 --> 00:40:05.433
flourish for a couple hundred
years, or a few decades, and

00:40:05.433 --> 00:40:06.700
then collapse?

00:40:09.267 --> 00:40:11.200
Questions?

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.567
Questions about this,
or problems?

00:40:15.233 --> 00:40:16.533
You know how to reach me,
paul.freedman@yale.edu.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:24.767
I put my office, 327 HGS,
and office hours.

00:40:24.767 --> 00:40:25.800
Please come and see me.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.433
And I look forward to talking
with you on Monday.

00:40:29.433 --> 00:40:30.667
Thanks.

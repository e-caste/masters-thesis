00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.960
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Last time I

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.798
finished up my lectures on
Wise Blood by trying to

00:00:08.798 --> 00:00:12.841
draw together three different
ways of reading the novel into

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:17.942
one interpretative framework,
and what I ultimately argued

00:00:17.942 --> 00:00:23.539
was that the New Critical formal
unity of the novel that is

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.761
epitomized,
I think (in a somewhat,

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:30.504
perhaps, heavy-handed way),
in Chapter 7 of the

00:00:30.504 --> 00:00:35.304
novel--that's book-ended by the
symbol of the blinding white

00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:40.111
cloud--that it's that unity,
in a sense, that replaces the

00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:44.135
bodily unities that are always
blown apart in O'Connor's

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:47.340
fiction.
And, in a certain way,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.780
what you see is a fiction that
is personified in that way,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.740
that it takes on the qualities
and the values of the person,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.969
and for O'Connor that means the
person understood in a religious

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.393
framework as something with
transcendent meaning and

00:01:05.393 --> 00:01:11.640
transcendent value and,
indeed, a transcendent life.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.790
There is a very different image
of the personified word in

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.849
Lolita, and I'm going to
refer now to an essay,

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:25.616
a 1992 essay,
by the British novelist Martin

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:29.588
Amis.
He compares the prose style in

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:33.729
Lolita with a
muscle-bound man,

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.670
a man whose body is bulked up
purely for aesthetic reasons,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.624
for only the purpose of looking
a certain way,

00:01:44.624 --> 00:01:49.545
that the bodybuilder is not
that person who's going to go

00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:53.500
out and use their muscles to do
some job.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.181
It is simply there to be looked
at, to be oiled up and presented

00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:02.069
and displayed.
That's how Amos describes the

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.149
prose style of Lolita.
So, I want you to keep that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.583
image in your mind.
The question of the

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:12.961
relationship between the person
and the aesthetic in Lolita

00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:17.483
is going to be at the heart
of my overarching argument about

00:02:17.483 --> 00:02:19.803
the novel.
Today, you're not going to

00:02:19.803 --> 00:02:22.666
see much of that.
What I want to do today--since

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:26.689
we have three lectures on
Lolita--what I want to do

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.146
today is simply to begin to open
the text for you:

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:33.039
to give you some ways of
reading it;

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.250
to alert you to certain kinds
of questions;

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.410
to ask you some overarching
questions;

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.977
and also to just get you
thinking and into the texture of

00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:47.097
the novel.
First, I want to ask you

00:02:47.097 --> 00:02:50.470
though, what do you think of
this so far?

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.970
I just want to hear from you.
What are you responses?

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.230
Who really hates this novel so
far?

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.611
Anybody?
Yes.

00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:02.919
Okay.
Why do you hate this novel?

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.940
Student:
I guess it's because of the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.400
fact that he's doing something
that's really not good,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.446
and it almost seems like he's
trivializing it.Professor

00:03:09.446 --> 00:03:10.419
Amy Hungerford:
Uh huh.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.462
What about it trivializes that
crime?Student:

00:03:14.462 --> 00:03:19.059
I guess it's just that
there's no moral lens that we're

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:23.400
looking at it through.
It's just his view of the world.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.210
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Uh huh.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.748
Okay.
So, Humbert's lack of a moral

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:31.152
vocabulary to understand what
he's doing makes it seems like

00:03:31.152 --> 00:03:32.980
it's trivialized.
Okay.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.691
Other thoughts on this?
Who else is really put off by

00:03:35.691 --> 00:03:38.312
this subject matter?
Even if you like the novel,

00:03:38.312 --> 00:03:40.210
who else is really put off by
this?

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.090
Yes.Student:
I agree with her.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.441
It's disturbing how much we
identify with Humbert,

00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:49.723
how we're made to see the world
through his eyes,

00:03:49.723 --> 00:03:53.280
and we kind of-- even I--grew
to like him a lot.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.123
At least, the way he's
presented, he's a very likable

00:03:57.123 --> 00:04:00.367
character.
And then, it's kind of like the

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:03.789
things that he does are kind of
on the side,

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:07.048
when you think about it in a
veryâ€¦.The whole telling

00:04:07.048 --> 00:04:09.240
of the story is not objective at
all,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.804
and when you think of it in an
objective sort of way,

00:04:10.804 --> 00:04:12.398
it's a completely different
story.Professor Amy

00:04:12.398 --> 00:04:15.195
Hungerford: Okay.
So, you're suggestion is that

00:04:15.195 --> 00:04:19.426
what's so disturbing about this
is that we actually like this

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.105
guy;
we actually come to like

00:04:21.105 --> 00:04:22.536
Humbert.
How many of you-- now,

00:04:22.536 --> 00:04:25.362
I asked you this question about
O'Connor's characters--would you

00:04:25.362 --> 00:04:27.470
like to sit down to dinner with
any of them?

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.180
Would you like to sit down to
dinner with Humbert?

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.156
(And I would say this knowing
that all of us are outside the

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:39.542
nymphet age range.) So,
given that, who would like to

00:04:39.542 --> 00:04:42.740
sit down with Humbert and why?
Okay.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.593
Yes, you.
Why?Student:

00:04:44.593 --> 00:04:48.430
Well, simply because I
would argue that Humbert in fact

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.664
does have a moral vocabulary and
tells us how terrible the things

00:04:52.664 --> 00:04:55.173
he's doing are.
And yet, you like him anyway,

00:04:55.173 --> 00:04:57.279
and I think that's the power of
the novel, and that's why I

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.985
think he's such a
character.Professor Amy

00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:02.759
Hungerford: Okay.
Do you think that Humbert

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:08.079
really believes that his actions
are terrible?

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:11.700
Do you believe him when he
says, "Oh, I was so ashamed.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.583
I was so awful."
Do you believe

00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:16.269
him?Student:
No.

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:17.880
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Oh,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.499
you don't.
Okay.

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:20.110
All right.
Does anyone believe him?

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.910
Yes.Student:
Well, sometimes he brings

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.660
up these classic figures that,
he argues, would have the same

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.369
interest.
He mentions Virgil and Dante,

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:34.381
and it seems like the
desperation of bringing up such

00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:36.987
grand figures makes me think
that he does have

00:05:36.987 --> 00:05:40.347
doubts.Professor Amy
Hungerford: About what he's

00:05:40.347 --> 00:05:41.585
doing.
Uh huh.

00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:44.152
Uh huh.
So, the authority of the canon

00:05:44.152 --> 00:05:48.107
that he invokes to defend
himself in fact suggests perhaps

00:05:48.107 --> 00:05:51.067
that he has some doubts?
Yes.Student:

00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:53.612
That's interesting.
I took those same references

00:05:53.612 --> 00:05:55.807
the exact opposite way,
'cause I thought that

00:05:55.807 --> 00:05:58.651
essentially he's referring to
the temporality of our moral

00:05:58.651 --> 00:06:01.115
structure,
and how it's just this

00:06:01.115 --> 00:06:04.860
arbitrary code which our society
has decided upon.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.248
And, at one point in time,
he laments the end of the old

00:06:08.248 --> 00:06:11.754
Latin world and the B.C.
world, when people could have

00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:14.250
these child
slaves.Professor Amy

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.089
Hungerford: Right.
Right.

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:17.139
Yeah.
Okay.

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.620
So, this evidence is very
possible to see in diametrically

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.123
opposed ways,
and you're certainly not the

00:06:23.123 --> 00:06:26.604
first two students that I've
seen have those two different

00:06:26.604 --> 00:06:30.561
reactions to the same thing.
What else does this novel bring

00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:33.900
out in you: what other thoughts,
what other responses?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.190
Does anyone absolutely love
this novel?

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.920
Okay. Lots of you. Good. Why?
Who wants to tell me why?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.581
Yes.Student:
The beauty of the language

00:06:51.581 --> 00:06:53.699
and symmetry,
the sentence structure,

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:55.946
the word choice:
I guess going away from the

00:06:55.946 --> 00:06:58.663
theme, more of just the
language.Professor Amy

00:06:58.663 --> 00:07:00.126
Hungerford: Uh huh.
Okay.

00:07:00.126 --> 00:07:02.060
The language,
yeah, absolutely.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.485
Student:
Even more about the

00:07:03.485 --> 00:07:05.209
language: it's not just that
it's beautiful.

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:08.482
It sort of draws attention to
the power of words,

00:07:08.482 --> 00:07:12.299
because you've tried to ask us
whether or not we find him

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:15.365
sympathetic,
and I think in this book we're

00:07:15.365 --> 00:07:19.381
sort of reminded of how words
can make us feel things and make

00:07:19.381 --> 00:07:22.410
us believe things that are
repugnant to us,

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.465
and sort of mask--it sort of
takes the mask off literature

00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:28.520
and shows us the way we are
convinced.Professor Amy

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.629
Hungerford: Okay.
"Takes the mask off literature."

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:34.062
I actually want to change that
around, if I might,

00:07:34.062 --> 00:07:36.495
and play with that,
because that's a really useful

00:07:36.495 --> 00:07:38.630
image for us:
"takes the mask off literature

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.658
and reminds us how we come to be
sympathetic or how we come to

00:07:41.658 --> 00:07:45.001
think something."
Think back to Richard Wright,

00:07:45.001 --> 00:07:49.131
who wants words to disappear,
to be completely transparent

00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:52.319
and to leave you just with your
response.

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:55.242
In a certain way,
I would want to flip your image

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:57.604
around.
It's as if Nabokov allows us to

00:07:57.604 --> 00:08:00.648
see the mask of
literature, to actually see it

00:08:00.648 --> 00:08:05.879
there palpably doing its work,
so we can become self-aware of

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:09.882
how we respond.
But, how many of you didn't

00:08:09.882 --> 00:08:14.368
experience it as understanding
why you were having that

00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:17.939
response to Humbert,
but just having it?

00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:21.098
Were any of you sort of
experiencing this more like

00:08:21.098 --> 00:08:24.698
Wright wants us to experience
literature, to just have the

00:08:24.698 --> 00:08:27.310
response?
Anyone really seduced?

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:33.457
Yes.Student:
Well, I found that,

00:08:33.457 --> 00:08:40.189
while I might have found the
prose more or less

00:08:40.189 --> 00:08:48.971
relentlessâ€¦it was very
difficult to escape into my own

00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:57.460
reaction, and I was more or less
in his head.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.262
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Okay.

00:08:58.262 --> 00:09:01.269
Yes.
Do we ever escape from his head?

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:04.737
You're saying that you don't-
you didn't feel like you ever

00:09:04.737 --> 00:09:06.889
could, in the world of this
prose.

00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:09.526
This is going to be an
important question for us as we

00:09:09.526 --> 00:09:12.312
think about what happens to
Lolita over the course of the

00:09:12.312 --> 00:09:15.404
novel.
Do we ever escape from the

00:09:15.404 --> 00:09:20.348
subjectivity of Humbert?
Is there any way to access the

00:09:20.348 --> 00:09:24.360
subjectivity of Lolita herself?
So, this is one question you

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.534
want to ask yourself.
And, if there are moments when

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:34.477
something like Nabokov's voice
or point of view shades into

00:09:34.477 --> 00:09:37.380
Humbert's,
what are those moments,

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.572
if you think there are some?
What are the moments when that

00:09:41.572 --> 00:09:44.449
subjectivity,
the sort of prison of that

00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:46.220
subjectivity,
wavers?

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.288
Where do you see those?
I'll leave that as a question

00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:50.882
for you.
Well, let me give you a

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:53.475
little bit of background.
It's very helpful for me,

00:09:53.475 --> 00:09:56.355
as I address you,
to think about what you're

00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:59.370
seeing in the text,
and that helps me to think

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.139
about what I want to say to you.
So, before I get in to that,

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:04.889
let me just give you some
background.

00:10:04.889 --> 00:10:07.809
Some of you probably know a
little bit about Nabokov's life.

00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:11.509
He was born in 1899,
and his life,

00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:17.225
to me, is fascinating because
he was one of the last

00:10:17.225 --> 00:10:23.502
generation raised in the old
aristocratic chateau life of

00:10:23.502 --> 00:10:28.060
Russia.
And it wasn't just a Russian

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.150
aristocracy;
it was really a very

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.039
cosmopolitan European
aristocracy.

00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:39.434
He lived in the summers on a
country estate outside St.

00:10:39.434 --> 00:10:43.129
Petersburg, in a beautiful
chateau.

00:10:43.129 --> 00:10:46.042
And his uncle owned the chateau
down the road,

00:10:46.042 --> 00:10:49.860
and actually left it to him
when he was a very young man.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.580
So, he actually owned for a
short time this huge chateau,

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.499
and other relatives and friends
lived in estates surrounding

00:10:57.499 --> 00:11:00.345
theirs.
It had huge parks as part of

00:11:00.345 --> 00:11:04.955
its land, where he first learned
to hunt butterflies and mount

00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:07.436
them.
And he became a serious

00:11:07.436 --> 00:11:12.415
lepidopterist as he grew older,
and was very early in his life

00:11:12.415 --> 00:11:17.230
passionate about collecting and
classifying butterflies.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:23.414
In the winters he lived in the
city in a beautiful town house

00:11:23.414 --> 00:11:26.815
in St.
Petersburg, and he attended

00:11:26.815 --> 00:11:31.399
school only later in his life.
When he was young,

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.440
as was the custom,
he had tutors.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:39.162
So he had a French tutor who
lived with the family for a long

00:11:39.162 --> 00:11:41.403
time.
He had Russian and English

00:11:41.403 --> 00:11:45.334
tutors that came in succession;
he had drawing masters and so

00:11:45.334 --> 00:11:48.635
on, to cover the range of
education thought to be

00:11:48.635 --> 00:11:51.730
appropriate to a young man of
his station.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.191
His father was a democrat
in czarist Russia,

00:11:56.191 --> 00:12:02.197
and he was quite a reformer.
At the time that the Bolsheviks

00:12:02.197 --> 00:12:06.781
took over in 1919,
there was a brief window of

00:12:06.781 --> 00:12:10.550
time prior to the family's
flight.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:14.246
The family left Russia in 1919.
So, the revolution,

00:12:14.246 --> 00:12:17.677
I think, starts in 1917.
And things are quite complex in

00:12:17.677 --> 00:12:20.466
those early days,
so there's more than one

00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:24.663
anti-czarist factor.
And his father was a democrat

00:12:24.663 --> 00:12:28.056
but not a Bolshevik;
so, he was anti-czarist,

00:12:28.056 --> 00:12:31.216
but he was not a Bolshevik.
His father wrote for

00:12:31.216 --> 00:12:35.067
revolutionary newspapers,
and he continued to write and

00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:38.990
publish a newspaper even as an
émigré.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:44.327
He was assassinated in 1922 in
Europe on account of his

00:12:44.327 --> 00:12:48.245
publishing activities.
Nabokov was very,

00:12:48.245 --> 00:12:52.870
very fond of his parents.
He has these luminous,

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:58.623
luminous essays about his life
as a child in this sort of

00:12:58.623 --> 00:13:02.629
perfectly intact aristocratic
world,

00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:07.061
and in that picture his mother
and father loom very large and

00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:11.216
in a very fond light.
Nearly invisible are his

00:13:11.216 --> 00:13:14.446
siblings.
He had two brothers and two

00:13:14.446 --> 00:13:18.695
sisters, and it's amazing,
when you read his memoirs,

00:13:18.695 --> 00:13:22.341
how invisible they are.
This is one thing I find

00:13:22.341 --> 00:13:26.019
striking about those memoirs,
but it's an interesting thing

00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:28.620
to ponder as we think about
Lolita.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.888
It's the image of a person
who is profoundly--at least in

00:13:32.888 --> 00:13:36.373
his representation of
himself--profoundly occupied

00:13:36.373 --> 00:13:39.289
with what's going on in his own
mind.

00:13:39.289 --> 00:13:43.450
His parents were very much
absent from his growing-up life.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:47.342
He spent a lot of time with his
nannies and tutors and nurses

00:13:47.342 --> 00:13:50.461
when he was younger.
His parents would travel,

00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:54.048
and his father was often away
in the city on political

00:13:54.048 --> 00:13:56.889
business when they were in the
country.

00:13:56.889 --> 00:14:00.637
So his parents loomed large:
but not so much as physical

00:14:00.637 --> 00:14:04.590
figures, people he would
interact with in a daily sense,

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.253
but almost as icons,
or as figures of the

00:14:08.253 --> 00:14:11.859
imagination, for him.
The real people he was,

00:14:11.859 --> 00:14:14.727
sort of, with--certainly his
brother, Sergey,

00:14:14.727 --> 00:14:18.312
who he was educated with (his
sisters were educated in a

00:14:18.312 --> 00:14:22.288
different way and were somewhat
younger than him)--even Sergey

00:14:22.288 --> 00:14:24.570
is sort of invisible to him.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:32.427
He wrote literature in
Russian, novels in Russian,

00:14:32.427 --> 00:14:36.616
when he was in Europe.
And then, when he moved to the

00:14:36.616 --> 00:14:39.634
United States,
he began to write in English,

00:14:39.634 --> 00:14:43.987
and took America as his adopted
land and English as his adopted

00:14:43.987 --> 00:14:46.594
language.
English was a native language,

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:49.085
in a certain way,
because English was spoken in

00:14:49.085 --> 00:14:52.245
his household all the time,
and he was trained by an

00:14:52.245 --> 00:14:54.549
English governess as a young
child.

00:14:54.549 --> 00:14:58.919
So, it's a language that goes
deep in his upbringing.

00:14:58.919 --> 00:15:02.149
It's not really
analogous--well,

00:15:02.149 --> 00:15:07.776
I'm not going to get in to
that--it's not analogous to,

00:15:07.776 --> 00:15:11.631
say, Conrad,
who is Polish and learned

00:15:11.631 --> 00:15:15.142
English.
And you can see the marks in

00:15:15.142 --> 00:15:19.174
Conrad's fiction of his having
learned English and then,

00:15:19.174 --> 00:15:23.279
it comes across as a sort of
clotted style in Conrad.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:26.646
Some of the difficulty of
Conrad's style is the difficulty

00:15:26.646 --> 00:15:28.950
of writing in this acquired
language.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.859
Nabokov has none of
that.So, what I want to do

00:15:33.859 --> 00:15:40.172
now is, with that background in
mind, I want to take this up and

00:15:40.172 --> 00:15:43.879
just open up the first few
pages.

00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:50.941
And I urge you not to neglect
the foreword by John Ray Jr.,

00:15:50.941 --> 00:15:57.759
so I hope you read it,
the little italicized foreword.

00:15:57.759 --> 00:16:03.590
And I want to focus especially
on pages 4 and 5.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:07.266
Now, a foreword is of course
supposed to suggest how you

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:09.740
should read the text that's
coming.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:16.682
And so, if we take it on in
that role, let's see what we

00:16:16.682 --> 00:16:19.516
see.
I'm going to read a little bit

00:16:19.516 --> 00:16:21.950
of this.
This is on page 4 and 5: 

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.198
For the benefit of
old-fashioned readers who wish

00:16:29.198 --> 00:16:32.585
to follow the destinies of the
real people beyond the true

00:16:32.585 --> 00:16:34.981
story,
a few details may be given,

00:16:34.981 --> 00:16:37.851
as received from Mr.
Windmuller of Ramsdale,

00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:41.322
who desires his identity
suppressed, so that the long

00:16:41.322 --> 00:16:45.326
shadow of this sorry and sordid
business should not reach the

00:16:45.326 --> 00:16:48.529
community to which he is proud
to belong.

00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:50.745
His daughter,
Louise, is by now a college

00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:54.009
sophomore.
Mona Dahl is a student in Paris.

00:16:54.009 --> 00:16:57.863
Rita has recently married the
proprietor of a hotel in

00:16:57.863 --> 00:16:58.906
Florida.
Mrs.

00:16:58.906 --> 00:17:01.679
Richard F.
Schiller died in childbed

00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:06.352
giving birth to a stillborn girl
on Christmas day in 1952 in

00:17:06.352 --> 00:17:10.630
Graystar, a settlement in the
remotest Northwest.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.379
Vivian Darkbloom has written a
biography, My Cue,

00:17:13.379 --> 00:17:16.399
to be published shortly,
and critics who have perused

00:17:16.399 --> 00:17:18.609
the manuscript call it her best
book.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:23.135
The caretakers of the various
cemeteries involved report that

00:17:23.135 --> 00:17:27.970
no ghosts walk.
First, let me point you to this

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.869
notation about Mrs.
Richard F.

00:17:30.869 --> 00:17:33.503
Schiller.
I'm not going to tell you who

00:17:33.503 --> 00:17:35.580
that is, but I want you to
figure it out.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.980
Okay?
So make a note in your notebook.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.989
By the end of the novel,
I would like you to know who

00:17:42.989 --> 00:17:45.806
this is.
Vivian Darkbloom:

00:17:45.806 --> 00:17:52.910
if you take those letters,
you can spell Vladimir Nabokov.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:59.614
Vivian Darkbloom is one of
Nabokov's palindromic versions

00:17:59.614 --> 00:18:03.250
of his name.
He inserts these even in his

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.140
autobiography,
by the way.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:09.685
He attributes certain things to
Vivian Darkbloom and other kinds

00:18:09.685 --> 00:18:15.292
of characters of such names.
So, here, you can't avoid the

00:18:15.292 --> 00:18:21.940
sense that, even though this is
attributed to John Ray,

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:27.675
in fact there is some other
voice here, and it's a voice

00:18:27.675 --> 00:18:33.619
that can't help but drop the
name of Vladimir Nabokov into

00:18:33.619 --> 00:18:36.432
the prose.
So, right away,

00:18:36.432 --> 00:18:41.389
in this moment of layered
narratives, a framed narrative

00:18:41.389 --> 00:18:46.347
around another narrative,
there is a sort of instability

00:18:46.347 --> 00:18:54.609
in the layers.
Where is Nabokov here?

00:18:54.609 --> 00:18:58.615
There is also the question of
what kind of reader we are that

00:18:58.615 --> 00:19:02.420
this preface brings up and sort
of puts in front of us.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:07.212
Are we the kind of reader who
is interested in the real

00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:11.624
persons?
Well, it gives the story that's

00:19:11.624 --> 00:19:18.218
to follow that sense of being
true, because it suggests its

00:19:18.218 --> 00:19:24.926
fictionality as a thin veneer
and that the real is something

00:19:24.926 --> 00:19:32.044
that we can know about.
And I would suggest to you that

00:19:32.044 --> 00:19:38.772
we can connect this with
Humbert's moment of wondering

00:19:38.772 --> 00:19:47.150
what happens to the little girls
whose images he is excited by.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:51.759
This is on page 21,
the beginning of chapter 6:

00:19:51.759 --> 00:19:56.153
I have often wondered
what became of those nymphets

00:19:56.153 --> 00:20:01.410
later in this wrought-iron world
of criss-cross cause and effect.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.673
Could it be that the hidden
throb I stole from them did not

00:20:05.673 --> 00:20:08.559
affect their future?
I had possessed her,

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:12.174
and she never knew it.
All right, but would it not

00:20:12.174 --> 00:20:16.224
tell sometime later?
Had I not somehow tampered with

00:20:16.224 --> 00:20:19.900
her fate by involving her image
in my voluptas?

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:25.495
Oh, it was and remains a source
of great and terrible

00:20:25.495 --> 00:20:29.514
wonder.
Both Humbert and John Ray

00:20:29.514 --> 00:20:33.842
suggest that the tissue between
the fictional,

00:20:33.842 --> 00:20:37.690
between the imagination and the
real,

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.664
is very light:
that it can be pierced somehow,

00:20:41.664 --> 00:20:47.711
that one can affect the other.
And I want to point you to a

00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:54.038
kind of language that also
permeates between the preface

00:20:54.038 --> 00:21:00.990
and the story proper.
And this is on page 5;

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:05.852
this is the middle paragraph: 
This commentator may be

00:21:05.852 --> 00:21:09.557
excused for repeating what he
has stressed in his own books

00:21:09.557 --> 00:21:12.180
and lectures,
namely that 'offensive' is

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.504
frequently a synonym for
'unusual,' and a great work of

00:21:15.504 --> 00:21:18.016
art is,
of course, always original and

00:21:18.016 --> 00:21:21.871
thus by its very nature should
come as a more or less shocking

00:21:21.871 --> 00:21:25.444
surprise.
I have no intention to glorify

00:21:25.444 --> 00:21:27.340
HH.
No doubt he is horrible.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.147
He is abject.
He is a shining example of

00:21:30.147 --> 00:21:32.632
moral leprosy,
a mixture of ferocity and

00:21:32.632 --> 00:21:35.309
jocularity that betrays supreme
misery,

00:21:35.309 --> 00:21:39.270
perhaps, but is not conducive
to attractiveness.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:43.198
He is ponderously capricious.
Many of his casual opinions on

00:21:43.198 --> 00:21:45.950
the people and scenery of this
country are ludicrous.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.893
A desperate honesty that throbs
through his confession does not

00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:52.820
absolve him from sins of
diabolical cunning.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.529
He is abnormal.
He is not a gentleman.

00:21:56.529 --> 00:22:00.020
But how magically his singing
violin can conjure up a

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:03.041
tendresse,
a compassion for Lolita that

00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:06.464
makes us entranced with the book
while abhorring its

00:22:06.464 --> 00:22:10.230
author.
Do you see that word "throbs"?

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:14.180
"A desperate honesty that
throbs through his confession."

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:22.015
"Throbs" is a word that Nabokov
brings out over and over again,

00:22:22.015 --> 00:22:28.334
in multiple contexts,
always connected somehow with

00:22:28.334 --> 00:22:32.561
this novel.
So, I'm going to ask you to

00:22:32.561 --> 00:22:35.843
read the afterword,
"On a Book Entitled

00:22:35.843 --> 00:22:39.730
Lolita." When you
read that,

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:43.660
you'll notice that the word
"throbs" comes back.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:49.099
The first impulse to write this
novel is described as a throb.

00:22:49.099 --> 00:22:53.015
The throb is of course
undeniably associated with

00:22:53.015 --> 00:22:56.849
Humbert's rising desire in that
physical way,

00:22:56.849 --> 00:23:01.282
and there is that emotionalized
version of that,

00:23:01.282 --> 00:23:05.809
the throbbing heart of romantic
cliché.

00:23:05.809 --> 00:23:09.289
It comes back and forth in his
memoirs too.

00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:12.190
In Speak,
Memory that word appears.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.885
It's interesting.
As the essays move

00:23:13.885 --> 00:23:16.844
chronologically--they were
written over a period of

00:23:16.844 --> 00:23:20.395
time--as the essays that were
written near Lolita come

00:23:20.395 --> 00:23:23.129
into the book,
that word appears,

00:23:23.129 --> 00:23:26.079
also, describing various
things.

00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:31.700
It's as if that word really
embodies the feel of this novel,

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.940
and so, like "Vivian
Darkbloom,"

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.876
that word suggests the
permeability--not just of

00:23:38.876 --> 00:23:43.400
fiction and the real--but of
these narrative layers.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:49.552
Where is Nabokov?
And I think he's there in that

00:23:49.552 --> 00:23:51.931
throb.
Now, I want to ask a

00:23:51.931 --> 00:23:54.654
question that we're going to
need to think about,

00:23:54.654 --> 00:23:57.718
and addresses the response
of--actually--the two of you

00:23:57.718 --> 00:24:01.248
sitting up front here,
when I was asking you how you

00:24:01.248 --> 00:24:05.476
responded to it.
Can we have a moral response to

00:24:05.476 --> 00:24:10.329
this novel?
And what would that look like?

00:24:10.329 --> 00:24:16.274
Well, John Ray asks us to,
and I want to just read part of

00:24:16.274 --> 00:24:20.549
that language of morality that
he uses.

00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:25.364
I'm going to start on 4,
and then I'm going to skip down

00:24:25.364 --> 00:24:29.140
to the bottom of 5:
Viewed simply as a novel,

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.245
Lolita deals with
situations and emotions that

00:24:32.245 --> 00:24:35.289
would remain exasperatingly
vague to the reader,

00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:38.186
had their expression been
etiolated by means of

00:24:38.186 --> 00:24:41.987
platitudinous evasions.
True: not a single obscene term

00:24:41.987 --> 00:24:44.430
is to be found in the whole
work.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.852
Indeed, the robust Philistine
who is conditioned by modern

00:24:47.852 --> 00:24:51.335
conventions into accepting
without qualms a lavish array of

00:24:51.335 --> 00:24:54.818
four-letter words in a banal
novel will be quite shocked by

00:24:54.818 --> 00:24:57.226
their absence here.
If, however,

00:24:57.226 --> 00:25:01.685
for this paradoxical prude's
comfort, an editor attempted to

00:25:01.685 --> 00:25:06.143
dilute or omit scenes that a
certain type of mind might call

00:25:06.143 --> 00:25:10.678
aphrodisiac [And then he makes
reference to the court case in

00:25:10.678 --> 00:25:15.589
which Ulysses was ruled
not to be obscene in 1933],

00:25:15.589 --> 00:25:18.504
one would have to forego the
publication of Lolita

00:25:18.504 --> 00:25:20.915
altogether,
since those very scenes that

00:25:20.915 --> 00:25:24.166
one might ineptly accuse of
sensuous existence of their own

00:25:24.166 --> 00:25:27.529
are the most strictly functional
ones in the development of a

00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:30.892
tragic tale tending unswervingly
to nothing less than a moral

00:25:30.892 --> 00:25:33.560
apotheosis.
The cynic may say that

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.609
commercial pornography makes the
same claim.

00:25:36.609 --> 00:25:39.762
The learned may counter by
asserting that HH's impassioned

00:25:39.762 --> 00:25:42.029
confession is a tempest in a
test tube,

00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:45.726
that at least 12% of American
adult males (a conservative

00:25:45.726 --> 00:25:48.695
estimate according to Dr.
Blanche Schwarzmann,

00:25:48.695 --> 00:25:52.589
verbal communication) enjoy
yearly in one way or another the

00:25:52.589 --> 00:25:56.880
special experience of HH that HH
describes as such despair,

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.735
that, had our demented diarist
gone in the fateful summer of

00:26:00.735 --> 00:26:03.349
1947 to a competent
psychopathologist,

00:26:03.349 --> 00:26:05.986
there would have been no
disaster, but then,

00:26:05.986 --> 00:26:08.930
neither would there have been
this book.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:13.868
In this part,
he suggests the possibility of

00:26:13.868 --> 00:26:20.069
the tale ending in a moral tale,
a moral apotheosis.

00:26:20.069 --> 00:26:24.168
But that's grounded,
also, or hedged around by the

00:26:24.168 --> 00:26:29.187
sense of psychiatry offering
other ways of understanding what

00:26:29.187 --> 00:26:33.558
we think of as deviance.
But this is hard to take

00:26:33.558 --> 00:26:37.868
seriously for a number of
reasons, not least the Dr.

00:26:37.868 --> 00:26:41.839
Blanche Schwarzmann who is
referred to here.

00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:43.295
It is, of course,
Dr.

00:26:43.295 --> 00:26:47.444
"White Blackman," and it's
referring to the Kinsey Report,

00:26:47.444 --> 00:26:52.030
the famous Kinsey Report on the
sexual habits of Americans.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.244
It came out in the 1950s.
Dr.

00:26:54.244 --> 00:26:57.181
Black Whiteman:
it suggests that these are

00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:00.547
matters of the heart that have
been reduced to a

00:27:00.547 --> 00:27:03.339
black-and-white set of
statistics,

00:27:03.339 --> 00:27:09.314
and you feel the absurdity of
that 12%, that number,

00:27:09.314 --> 00:27:14.000
appearing in that sentence
right here.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.549
And I'm just going to skip down
to the bottom of 5 now:

00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:20.345
As a case history,
Lolita will become no

00:27:20.345 --> 00:27:22.549
doubt a classic in psychiatric
circles.

00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:25.958
As a work of art it transcends
its expiatory aspects,

00:27:25.958 --> 00:27:30.023
and still more important to us
than scientific significance and

00:27:30.023 --> 00:27:33.891
literary worth is the ethical
impact the book should have on

00:27:33.891 --> 00:27:37.484
the serious reader.
For, in this poignant personal

00:27:37.484 --> 00:27:41.003
study, there lurks a general
lesson: the wayward child,

00:27:41.003 --> 00:27:43.869
the egotistic mother,
the panting maniac.

00:27:43.869 --> 00:27:46.769
These are not only vivid
characters in a unique story.

00:27:46.769 --> 00:27:49.450
They warn us of dangerous
trends.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:54.030
They point out potent evils.
Lolita should make all

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.028
of us--parents,
social workers,

00:27:56.028 --> 00:27:59.890
educators--apply ourselves with
still greater vigilance and

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.685
vision to the task of bringing
up a better generation in a

00:28:03.685 --> 00:28:07.020
safer world.
Well, aren't those ringing

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.996
words from John Ray?
Nabokov ensures that the very

00:28:11.996 --> 00:28:19.373
idea of taking a moral lesson
from this novel is unavailable

00:28:19.373 --> 00:28:25.000
to us because it's already been
ridiculed.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.931
He not only makes us see the
psychiatric evasion of morality

00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:34.650
as ridiculous,
as banal, as reductive,

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:38.369
reductive to the black and
white;

00:28:38.369 --> 00:28:44.028
he ensures, too,
that the language of morality

00:28:44.028 --> 00:28:48.430
is the language of
cliché.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:53.156
The status of cliché
in this novel is one with which

00:28:53.156 --> 00:28:58.967
we're going to have to struggle,
and I want to move in that

00:28:58.967 --> 00:29:02.545
direction,
now, by turning to our first

00:29:02.545 --> 00:29:07.291
hearing of Humbert's voice.
What can we say about Humbert's

00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:09.765
style?
If John Ray's style is full of

00:29:09.765 --> 00:29:13.786
certain kinds of clichés
that we can classify in the ways

00:29:13.786 --> 00:29:17.170
that I have just done,
what about Humbert's style?

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:23.410
Where does it come from,
and why is it so enchanting?

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.906
So, let's just begin with that
first chapter,

00:29:26.906 --> 00:29:29.289
the tiny chapter,
Chapter 1.

00:29:29.289 --> 00:29:33.620
"Lolita, light of my life,
fire of my loins.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.789
My sin, my soul.
Lo-li-ta.

00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:43.470
The tip of the tongue taking a
trip of three steps down the

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:48.269
palate to tap at three on the
teeth: Lo-li-ta."

00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:53.518
The first thing he does is make
us feel words in our bodies,

00:29:53.518 --> 00:29:57.521
and especially in the mouth and
in the tongue,

00:29:57.521 --> 00:30:02.492
in that very sensuous way.
So, that's the first thing that

00:30:02.492 --> 00:30:06.428
his style does for us:
it makes us align ourselves--in

00:30:06.428 --> 00:30:10.885
the way that some of you were
talking about earlier--not just

00:30:10.885 --> 00:30:15.490
to identify our minds with the
point of view of this particular

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.625
person,
this particular character,

00:30:18.625 --> 00:30:23.382
but actually to move your body,
and to feel something bodily

00:30:23.382 --> 00:30:27.894
that he wants you to feel,
to share that sensuous

00:30:27.894 --> 00:30:32.604
experience with him.
It's just the first little

00:30:32.604 --> 00:30:36.859
temptation.
He wants to draw us into the

00:30:36.859 --> 00:30:42.720
"special experience" that he
documents in his story:

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.686
She was Lo,
plain Lo, in the morning,

00:30:45.686 --> 00:30:48.300
standing four feet ten in one
sock.

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.190
She was Lola in slacks.
She was Dolly at school.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:53.549
She was Dolores on the dotted
line.

00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:58.250
But in my arms she was always
Lolita.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.980
Did she have a precursor?
She did.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.134
Indeed she did.
In point of fact,

00:31:03.134 --> 00:31:07.810
there might have been no Lolita
at all had I not loved one

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:12.321
summer a certain initial
girlchild in a princedom by the

00:31:12.321 --> 00:31:14.990
sea.
Oh, when?

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:18.218
About as many years before
Lolita was born as my age was

00:31:18.218 --> 00:31:20.878
that summer.
You can always count on a

00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:23.380
murderer for a fancy prose
style.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:27.687
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, exhibit number one is what

00:31:27.687 --> 00:31:31.119
the seraphs--the misinformed
simple noble-winged

00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:34.297
seraphs--envied.
Look at this tangle of

00:31:34.297 --> 00:31:36.760
thorns.
I'm seduced.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:42.100
Are you?
He's feeding us questions.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.340
This is another thing to notice.
He's not just making us

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.880
experience Lolita's name the way
he does;

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:52.858
he's assuming that there are
certain kinds of questions that

00:31:52.858 --> 00:31:55.569
we will ask.
"Did she have a precursor?"

00:31:55.569 --> 00:31:59.579
Why is this the first question
that you would ask?

00:31:59.579 --> 00:32:02.701
If someone was telling you this
story, is that the first

00:32:02.701 --> 00:32:05.510
question you would ask?
So did she have a precursor?

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:08.341
No, probably not.
Okay.

00:32:08.341 --> 00:32:11.413
Why?
Why does he want to plant this

00:32:11.413 --> 00:32:15.562
question with us?
Well, he's working towards

00:32:15.562 --> 00:32:20.248
something that he will also in
some ways backhandedly

00:32:20.248 --> 00:32:24.884
discredit.
He's counting on us to analyze

00:32:24.884 --> 00:32:30.820
him in somewhat Freudian terms.
So, even though he will make a

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.926
habit later on of playing with
psychiatrists--staying at

00:32:34.926 --> 00:32:39.183
clinics extra weeks just to
bother the newcomers by giving

00:32:39.183 --> 00:32:42.767
them made-up dreams and primal
scenes to read and

00:32:42.767 --> 00:32:46.650
interpret--even though he's
going to do that,

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:52.543
he's still manipulating us,
because he knows how deeply

00:32:52.543 --> 00:32:57.891
those kinds of exculpatory
narratives run with his

00:32:57.891 --> 00:33:00.640
audience.
So, she had a precursor.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.579
So what?
Does that make any difference?

00:33:02.579 --> 00:33:05.119
Does that make any difference
to how we're to judge him?

00:33:05.119 --> 00:33:08.154
And we are the judges:
"ladies and gentlemen of the

00:33:08.154 --> 00:33:10.724
jury."
We are, in a way,

00:33:10.724 --> 00:33:16.611
invited to judge,
even though he's begging us not

00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:21.452
to at every moment.
So, it's a choice on

00:33:21.452 --> 00:33:27.165
Nabokov's part to foreground the
question of judgment from moment

00:33:27.165 --> 00:33:31.215
one,
and then for him to invoke

00:33:31.215 --> 00:33:36.750
multiple kinds of exculpatory
narratives.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.240
He's planting them in there for
us to find.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.880
"Oh, when?"
In childhood.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:49.662
By safely locating that
precursor in his own childhood

00:33:49.662 --> 00:33:53.700
when, as he says,
he was her equal,

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:59.014
where there was no crime,
only a kind of infantile

00:33:59.014 --> 00:34:03.569
passion that nobody would blame
him for,

00:34:03.569 --> 00:34:09.551
he invites us to think of
Humbert as somehow still

00:34:09.551 --> 00:34:14.190
retaining a kind of innocent
purity,

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:19.963
that that passion itself is the
innocent purity that flames at

00:34:19.963 --> 00:34:25.353
the heart of childhood.
Then we get these allusions,

00:34:25.353 --> 00:34:31.833
and if you have the annotated
Lolita or if you already

00:34:31.833 --> 00:34:35.442
know Poe,
Annabel Lee is a famous

00:34:35.442 --> 00:34:39.604
poem by Edgar Allan Poe,
and "the princedom by the sea"

00:34:39.604 --> 00:34:42.762
is a feature of it.
And so, I'm going to read this

00:34:42.762 --> 00:34:45.929
to you, and there's a reason why
I want to read the whole thing.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:49.739
So, it'll just take a minute,
but here we go.

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:52.881
This is Annabel Lee:

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:57.499
It was many and many a
year ago,  In a kingdom by

00:34:57.499 --> 00:35:01.833
the sea, That a maiden there
lived whom you may know  By

00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:05.848
the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived

00:35:05.848 --> 00:35:10.170
with no other thought  Than
to love and be loved by me.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:14.264
She was a child and I was a
child,  In this kingdom by

00:35:14.264 --> 00:35:18.144
the sea,But we loved with a
love that was more than

00:35:18.144 --> 00:35:22.238
love-- I and my Annabel
Lee-- With a love that the

00:35:22.238 --> 00:35:26.190
winged seraphs of Heaven 
Coveted her and me.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.837
And this was the reason
that, long ago,

00:35:28.837 --> 00:35:32.367
 In this kingdom by the
sea, A wind blew out of a

00:35:32.367 --> 00:35:35.329
cloud by night chilling my
Annabel Lee;

00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:39.038
So that her highborn
kinsman came  And bore her

00:35:39.038 --> 00:35:41.510
away from me,
To shut her up in a

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.670
sepulchre  In this kingdom
by the sea.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:48.947
The angels, not half so happy
in heaven,  Went envying her

00:35:48.947 --> 00:35:51.988
and me:Yes!
that was the reason (as all men

00:35:51.988 --> 00:35:55.566
know,  In this kingdom by
the sea) That the wind came

00:35:55.566 --> 00:35:59.171
out of a cloud,
chilling And killing my

00:35:59.171 --> 00:36:02.256
Annabel Lee.
But our love it was stronger by

00:36:02.256 --> 00:36:06.048
far than the love  Of those
who were older than we--  Of

00:36:06.048 --> 00:36:09.660
many far wiser than we-- And
neither the angels in heaven

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.610
above Nor the demons down
under the sea,

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:16.103
Can ever dissever my soul
from the soul Of the

00:36:16.103 --> 00:36:19.400
beautiful Annabel Lee:
For the moon never beams,

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.840
without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.828
And the stars never rise
but I see the bright eyes 

00:36:27.828 --> 00:36:31.772
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide,

00:36:31.772 --> 00:36:34.929
I lie down by the side Of
my darling, my darling,

00:36:34.929 --> 00:36:39.734
my life and my bride, In
her sepulchre there by the

00:36:39.734 --> 00:36:44.450
sea-- In her tomb by the
side of the sea.

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:45.360
So, that's the whole poem.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:55.302
Humbert is drawing on a
nineteenth-century Romantic

00:36:55.302 --> 00:37:00.610
tradition that still has a
certain power.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:08.007
You can hear that incantatory
voice of Poe's speaker in the

00:37:08.007 --> 00:37:15.150
poem making this doomed love
into something aesthetic,

00:37:19.039 --> 00:37:24.010
but it's also a kind of
cliché.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:33.245
If John Ray works with the
clichés of psychiatry and

00:37:33.245 --> 00:37:37.752
of social work and,
in a way, of

00:37:37.752 --> 00:37:42.500
politics--progressive
politics--"bring up a better

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.732
generation for the future"--
Humbert has truck with the

00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:54.145
clichés of the literary.
So, his is a vocabulary of very

00:37:54.145 --> 00:37:58.809
high-born clichés.
It's interesting.

00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:01.985
When you read Speak,
Memory, Nabokov's

00:38:01.985 --> 00:38:04.583
autobiography,
he talks about his own

00:38:04.583 --> 00:38:08.697
experiments with this kind of
poetry when he was young and

00:38:08.697 --> 00:38:13.244
especially when he was beginning
to fall in love with girls that

00:38:13.244 --> 00:38:16.420
he would meet around St.
Petersburg.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:20.668
He represents them as
overheated attempts at

00:38:20.668 --> 00:38:25.409
literature, as dripping with a
kind of excess,

00:38:25.409 --> 00:38:30.238
romantic excess,
as essentially unable to do

00:38:30.238 --> 00:38:36.757
more than repeat a tradition.
What Humbert has found,

00:38:36.757 --> 00:38:41.820
and I guess Nabokov has given
him, in the Poe,

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:47.445
is not only that kind of
overheated Romantic poetic

00:38:47.445 --> 00:38:50.572
referent;
he's also chosen,

00:38:50.572 --> 00:38:55.780
of course, someone who married
a very, very young bride.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.405
So, Poe, I think at the age of
about twenty or twenty one,

00:39:00.405 --> 00:39:03.570
married his fourteen-year-old
cousin.

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:09.426
So, for that reason Poe becomes
a kind of model,

00:39:09.426 --> 00:39:16.652
and he's the model in both
ways: both as a pedophile and as

00:39:16.652 --> 00:39:24.502
someone who imagined himself and
his young love fully clothed in

00:39:24.502 --> 00:39:29.980
the language of romance.
So, it's a kind of fairy tale.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:36.812
Now the fairy tale language
that is invoked here,

00:39:36.812 --> 00:39:40.940
"the princedom by the sea,"

00:39:45.559 --> 00:39:56.222
is brought back for us vividly
in the scene where Humbert first

00:39:56.222 --> 00:39:59.800
sees Lolita.
This is on page 39.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.110
So, he's walking through the
house.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:15.250
The "Haze woman" is giving him
his tour of the house:

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.911
I was still walking
behind Mrs.

00:40:16.911 --> 00:40:18.941
Haze through the dining room
when, beyond it,

00:40:18.941 --> 00:40:20.880
there came a sudden burst of
greenery.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:26.533
"The piazza," sang out my
leader, and then without the

00:40:26.533 --> 00:40:32.400
least warning a blue sea wave
swelled under my heart,

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.468
and from a mat in a pool of sun
half naked, kneeling,

00:40:35.468 --> 00:40:39.036
turning about on her knees,
there was my Riviera love

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:41.710
peering at me over dark
sunglasses.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.326
It was the same child,
the same frail,

00:40:44.326 --> 00:40:46.872
honey-hued shoulders,
the same silky,

00:40:46.872 --> 00:40:50.619
supple bare back,
the same chestnut head of hair.

00:40:50.619 --> 00:40:54.443
A polka-dotted black kerchief
tied around her chest hid from

00:40:54.443 --> 00:40:58.201
my aging ape eyes but not from
the gaze of young memory the

00:40:58.201 --> 00:41:01.829
juvenile breasts I had fondled
one immortal day and,

00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:05.352
as if I were the fairy tale
nurse of some little princess

00:41:05.352 --> 00:41:07.868
lost, kidnapped,
discovered in gypsy rags

00:41:07.868 --> 00:41:11.202
through which her nakedness
smiled at the king and his

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:13.516
hounds,
I recognized the tiny,

00:41:13.516 --> 00:41:16.838
dark-brown mole on her side.
With awe and delight,

00:41:16.838 --> 00:41:19.729
the king crying for joy,
the trumpets blaring,

00:41:19.729 --> 00:41:22.943
the nurse drunk,
I saw again her lovely in-drawn

00:41:22.943 --> 00:41:26.479
abdomen where my southbound
mouth had briefly paused and

00:41:26.479 --> 00:41:29.951
those puerile hips on which I
had kissed the crenulated

00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:33.679
imprint left by the band of her
shorts that last mad,

00:41:33.679 --> 00:41:37.190
immortal day behind the Roches
Rose.

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:42.563
The twenty-five years I have
lived since then tapered to a

00:41:42.563 --> 00:41:46.239
palpitating point and
vanished.

00:41:46.239 --> 00:41:49.190
This is a remarkable passage to
me.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:55.280
He occupies in this passage
every subject position of the

00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:00.610
fairy tale: the nurse,
the hounds and the king.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:03.900
He's the nurse recognizing the
beloved child.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.588
He's the king after her,
and the hounds really

00:42:07.588 --> 00:42:08.440
after her.

00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:15.561
At the same time,
I think we feel the freshness

00:42:15.561 --> 00:42:19.177
of this prose,
and we feel the humor of it,

00:42:19.177 --> 00:42:23.824
the self-parody.
So, even though he is counting

00:42:23.824 --> 00:42:28.309
on us to be seduced by the
romantic language,

00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:32.860
that incantatory trance of
Annabel Lee,

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:39.519
there is a certain way in
which it's refreshed for us,

00:42:39.519 --> 00:42:42.174
like when he says,
"The twenty-five years I have

00:42:42.174 --> 00:42:45.790
lived since then tapered to a
palpitating point and vanished."

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:50.130
That is not from the fairy tale.
That's his own voice.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:53.846
One thing that Nabokov
does--and I think this is

00:42:53.846 --> 00:42:57.781
related to the way words like
"throb" and the layers of

00:42:57.781 --> 00:43:02.450
fiction and reality,
how these things permeate into

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:08.195
different texts and different
layers of the story--he always

00:43:08.195 --> 00:43:12.090
mixes originality with
cliché.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:16.853
He mixes the bad with the good.
He has a real disdain for the

00:43:16.853 --> 00:43:21.300
black and the white,
that sense of simplicity.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:25.904
And so, you're going to
find--even at moments where I

00:43:25.904 --> 00:43:31.659
think we're meant to understand
Humbert's prose as overwrought,

00:43:31.659 --> 00:43:36.361
that muscle-bound man that Amis
talks about--you're also going

00:43:36.361 --> 00:43:40.508
to find in those passages,
while you're being just brought

00:43:40.508 --> 00:43:43.779
to the sense of parody,
just to the edge of what you

00:43:43.779 --> 00:43:47.391
can tolerate in that vein,
you're going to get a sharp

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:49.998
sentence;
you're going to get a sharp

00:43:49.998 --> 00:43:52.610
piece of very original prose
style.

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:56.340
This is part of Nabokov's
talent, is to manipulate you.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.257
This is another way of
manipulating you,

00:43:59.257 --> 00:44:02.099
is to make you see the
cliché

00:44:02.099 --> 00:44:06.719
and then to draw back from it
to something that surprises you.

00:44:06.719 --> 00:44:17.489
So, this is part of the
strategy.

00:44:17.489 --> 00:44:21.390
And then watch what happens to
the prose style and the

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:25.165
difference in tone:
I find it most difficult

00:44:25.165 --> 00:44:29.044
to express with adequate force
that flash, that shiver,

00:44:29.044 --> 00:44:31.989
that impact of passionate
recognition.

00:44:31.989 --> 00:44:35.317
In the course of the sun-shot
moment that my glance slithered

00:44:35.317 --> 00:44:38.331
over the kneeling child,
her eyes blinking over those

00:44:38.331 --> 00:44:41.306
stern, dark spectacles,
the little Herr Doktor who was

00:44:41.306 --> 00:44:44.929
to cure me of all my aches,
while I passed by her in my

00:44:44.929 --> 00:44:46.940
adult disguise,
a great, big,

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.670
handsome hunk of movieland
manhood,

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:53.214
the vacuum of my soul managed
to suck in every detail of her

00:44:53.214 --> 00:44:56.578
bright beauty and these I
checked against the features of

00:44:56.578 --> 00:44:59.517
my dead bride.
A little later of course she,

00:44:59.517 --> 00:45:01.182
this nouvelle,
this Lolita,

00:45:01.182 --> 00:45:04.639
my Lolita, was to eclipse
completely her prototype.

00:45:04.639 --> 00:45:08.211
All I want to stress is that my
discovery of her was a fatal

00:45:08.211 --> 00:45:11.601
consequence of that "princedom
by the sea" in my tortured

00:45:11.601 --> 00:45:14.809
past.
And I think there's a reason

00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:19.737
why there are quotations around
that princedom by the sea and

00:45:19.737 --> 00:45:23.186
why it's Poe:
a fatal consequence--not just

00:45:23.186 --> 00:45:27.950
of his early love for Annabel
Lee--but a consequence of the

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:31.388
poetry.
This is another kind of

00:45:31.388 --> 00:45:35.070
defense: "the poetry made me do
it."

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:42.581
It's the romance that's being
offered in the poetry that lends

00:45:42.581 --> 00:45:49.128
his life its course.
So, here the rationales for his

00:45:49.128 --> 00:45:55.690
guilt, and our forgiveness of
it, begin to multiply.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:46:01.483
Now, I want to draw back
from just being immersed in

00:46:01.483 --> 00:46:07.804
those details of the text for a
minute to suggest to you that

00:46:07.804 --> 00:46:13.071
this question of morality is
something that Nabokov

00:46:13.071 --> 00:46:18.642
deliberately courts.
When Nabokov was an exile in

00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:24.409
Europe, he spent a lot of time
composing chess problems.

00:46:24.409 --> 00:46:28.603
These are setups of pieces on
the chess board that have

00:46:28.603 --> 00:46:32.085
particular solutions.
And they're very complex,

00:46:32.085 --> 00:46:35.340
and they have a kind of
aesthetic form to them.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:40.449
And he would aim for certain
kinds of elegance in them.

00:46:40.449 --> 00:46:42.920
He never wanted to have an
alternate solution.

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.179
He always wanted to have a
single kind of solution.

00:46:46.179 --> 00:46:50.080
There are certain themes in
chess that refer to different

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.190
kinds of strategic movements
that he would bring out through

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:58.815
these little arrangements,
and he would spend inordinate

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:03.221
amounts of time organizing them.
Let me read to you how he

00:47:03.221 --> 00:47:06.690
describes the action of setting
one of these things up:

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:13.489
It should be understood
that competition in chess

00:47:13.489 --> 00:47:16.030
problems is not really between
white and black,

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:19.639
but between the composer and
the hypothetical solver.

00:47:19.639 --> 00:47:23.762
Just as in a first-rate work of
fiction, the real clash is not

00:47:23.762 --> 00:47:27.344
between the characters,
but between the author and the

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:29.601
world.
So that a great part of the

00:47:29.601 --> 00:47:32.237
problem's value is due to the
number of tries,

00:47:32.237 --> 00:47:34.783
delusive opening moves,
false scents,

00:47:34.783 --> 00:47:38.957
specious lines of play,
astutely and lovingly prepared

00:47:38.957 --> 00:47:41.949
to lead the would-be solver
astray.

00:47:41.949 --> 00:47:45.121
But whatever I can say about
this matter of problem

00:47:45.121 --> 00:47:48.863
composing, I do not seem to
convey sufficiently the ecstatic

00:47:48.863 --> 00:47:52.161
core of the process and its
points of connection with

00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:54.859
various other,
more overt and fruitful,

00:47:54.859 --> 00:47:57.957
operations of the creative
mind: from the charting of

00:47:57.957 --> 00:48:00.888
dangerous seas,
to the writing of one of those

00:48:00.888 --> 00:48:04.108
incredible novels where the
author, in a fit of lucid

00:48:04.108 --> 00:48:06.741
madness,
has set himself certain unique

00:48:06.741 --> 00:48:09.993
rules that he observes,
certain nightmare obstacles

00:48:09.993 --> 00:48:12.939
that he surmounts,
with the zest of a deity

00:48:12.939 --> 00:48:17.018
building a live world from the
most unlikely ingredients--rocks

00:48:17.018 --> 00:48:19.820
and carbon,
and blind throbbings.

00:48:24.409 --> 00:48:27.948
Lolita is,
I think, for Nabokov,

00:48:27.948 --> 00:48:33.490
a kind of chess problem.
The chess problem is:

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:41.070
how can Nabokov make us
identify with a pedophile?

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:46.653
How can he produce,
from these debased ingredients,

00:48:46.653 --> 00:48:53.019
what Lionel Trilling called
it--and you have this blurb on

00:48:53.019 --> 00:48:59.719
your back cover-- "the greatest
love story of our time"?

00:48:59.719 --> 00:49:03.793
That's a question for you:
is it the greatest love story

00:49:03.793 --> 00:49:07.099
of our time?
Was Lionel Trilling--a great

00:49:07.099 --> 00:49:11.639
mid-century literary critic--was
he seduced by Humbert?

00:49:11.639 --> 00:49:14.900
What would it mean to be the
greatest love story of our time?

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:19.728
But certainly Nabokov has in
mind the rhetoric of love

00:49:19.728 --> 00:49:23.099
stories, the shape of love
stories,

00:49:23.099 --> 00:49:27.679
and he's using those,
with all the skill he can

00:49:27.679 --> 00:49:33.255
muster, to try to make us enter
in to the ecstasy that he

00:49:33.255 --> 00:49:39.130
describes at the heart of this
kind of logical problem,

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.820
the setting up of this logical
problem.

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:47.989
So, in a way we are the solvers
of this problem for him;

00:49:47.989 --> 00:49:52.083
we are the other half that
completes the aesthetic

00:49:52.083 --> 00:49:56.121
experience;
we are there to participate in

00:49:56.121 --> 00:50:01.045
it with him.
And, on the handout that I

00:50:01.045 --> 00:50:08.213
have given you the world of
imagination and of the aesthetic

00:50:08.213 --> 00:50:13.559
is very much on the surface of
this text.

00:50:13.559 --> 00:50:18.133
And you can see it in lots of
ways, too, just in that little

00:50:18.133 --> 00:50:22.551
bit of the first chapter that I
read to you, that sense of

00:50:22.551 --> 00:50:26.628
fancy: "a fancy prose style."
So, you want to think of

00:50:26.628 --> 00:50:30.170
"fancy" not just as a sort of
effeminate ornamentation,

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:34.190
but as that older-fashioned
sense of the word:

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:39.565
"the fancy," the imagination.
So, imagination is a privileged

00:50:39.565 --> 00:50:43.516
realm for Nabokov,
and it is a realm that always

00:50:43.516 --> 00:50:47.868
has about it that golden glow.
And as you read

00:50:47.868 --> 00:50:53.867
Lolita, try to
notice how much light imagery

00:50:53.867 --> 00:50:56.006
there is.
For Nabokov,

00:50:56.006 --> 00:51:00.169
sunlight, goldenness--all those
midges, the golden midges,

00:51:00.169 --> 00:51:03.309
the downy golden hair on
Lolita's limbs,

00:51:03.309 --> 00:51:07.999
her tawny skin--all of that
goldenness is very much of a

00:51:07.999 --> 00:51:11.239
piece with the world of
imagination.

00:51:11.239 --> 00:51:15.403
So, it's as if imagination
makes everything glitter,

00:51:15.403 --> 00:51:19.730
and its color is that of the
most aesthetic of metals,

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:22.505
of gold.
So, keep these things in mind

00:51:22.505 --> 00:51:26.035
as you read, and in the next
couple of lectures you'll see

00:51:26.035 --> 00:51:29.380
more of the development of
argument about the book,

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:31.000
but I hope this gets you
started.

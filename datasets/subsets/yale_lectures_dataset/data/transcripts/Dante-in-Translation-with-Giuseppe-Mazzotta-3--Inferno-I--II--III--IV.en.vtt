00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.750
Prof: We'll begin today
with Inferno.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.750
Let me say a few things about
the poem in general,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.650
the structure of the poem,
the formal structure,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.881
and then we get into the cantos
I, II, III, IV which have been

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.720
assigned to you.
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.742
I already, in passing,
in my introductory remarks,

00:00:25.742 --> 00:00:29.765
I did say something about the
title as you recall,

00:00:29.765 --> 00:00:31.900
the title of the poem.
 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.660
The poem, we refer to it as
the Divine Comedy,

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.120
it should be
"Comedy."

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.947
That's what Dante calls it and
he called it comedy for a number

00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:42.750
of reasons.
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.070
The first reason is that it
ends in--with--in happiness.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.254
It's a story that begins with a
kind of disorder,

00:00:52.254 --> 00:00:55.872
catastrophe if you wish;
the pilgrim was lost in the

00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:59.307
woods and then works himself out
toward the light,

00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:01.548
toward the truth,
toward God.

00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:10.110
That's--so comedy describes the
thematic trajectory of the poem.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.635
It's going from one condition
to another, and from this point

00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:17.280
of view, it's literally the
opposite of the tragic movement.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.578
In the tragic movement,
you always have some kind of

00:01:20.578 --> 00:01:24.394
initial state of cohesion or
initial state of happiness that

00:01:24.394 --> 00:01:29.069
then goes on--
going toward some kind of

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.159
fatality or disaster.
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.352
There's a second reason for the
title "comedy"

00:01:35.352 --> 00:01:37.500
and the second reason is
stylistic.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.295
Dante, he calls it a comedy
because he adopts the

00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:43.430
vernacular, first of all.
 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.173
As opposed to--the possibility
would have been writing it in

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:50.278
Latin in a kind of--
the language of philosophy and

00:01:50.278 --> 00:01:53.640
the language of great cultural
exchanges but he calls it--

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.940
instead he uses the Italian
vulgar language.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.965
It also means that
stylistically he adopts a humble

00:02:01.965 --> 00:02:02.608
style.
 

00:02:02.608 --> 00:02:06.700
You know what the theory of
styles is coming to us from

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.669
ancient Greece and Rome.
 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.139
There are three levels of
styles.

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:15.870
Three levels of style:
there is the high tragic style

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.692
or the sublime style that
describes exactly the events

00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:24.240
that involve kings since style
is--

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.784
must have some kind of aptness
to the situation that the story

00:02:28.784 --> 00:02:29.680
describes.
 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.318
Then, there is a middle style
or an elegiac style,

00:02:33.318 --> 00:02:37.031
and then there is a low style,
the style of comedy,

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:40.669
the style that indeed Dante
will adopt lowly;

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:45.444
but this is a kind of peculiar
implication for Dante to call a

00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:48.240
story such as his,
a "comedy"

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.310
and this is the implication:
that,

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.587
in effect, he undercuts the
idea of a rigid hierarchy of

00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:57.729
reality.
 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:01.281
There is no such neat
separation of the high,

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.378
the middle, and the low.
 

00:03:03.378 --> 00:03:07.015
That which is low and humble,
such as the experience he is

00:03:07.015 --> 00:03:10.063
describing,
his own experience--an ordinary

00:03:10.063 --> 00:03:14.301
human being of living around the
year 1300 who manages to have

00:03:14.301 --> 00:03:18.680
this extraordinary experience of
going up to see the face of God

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.788
and come back--
to return--come back to the

00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:23.508
earth to tell us about it.
 

00:03:23.508 --> 00:03:29.072
It's really a sign that the low
can become high and the high can

00:03:29.072 --> 00:03:30.220
become low.
 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.199
That this--that the classical
distinctions that we read--

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.114
of which we read in the
Poetics of Aristotle that

00:03:38.114 --> 00:03:41.031
Dante did not know,
or in Horace's Poetic

00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:44.687
Art that Dante did know,
are really false,

00:03:44.687 --> 00:03:46.500
are really illusory.
 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.745
This is not the way to proceed,
so Dante has a number of items

00:03:50.745 --> 00:03:53.669
that he's pursuing in calling
this text the

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.270
"Comedy."
 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.532
The other thing I have to say
about the formal structure of

00:03:57.532 --> 00:03:58.851
the poem,
as you all know,

00:03:58.851 --> 00:04:01.086
it's divided into three parts:
Hell,

00:04:01.086 --> 00:04:03.270
Purgatory,
and Paradise.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.560
Easy.
 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.508
Each of them has thirty-three
cantos, with the exception of

00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:10.960
Inferno.
 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.187
Inferno has thirty-four
cantos, which means there's

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.680
one--Canto I,
which we are going to read in a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.379
moment, plus thirty-three.
 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:22.952
They are neatly separated in
that, Canto I represents and

00:04:22.952 --> 00:04:26.300
stands for a kind of general
rehearsal.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.699
It's a journey that fails.
 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.329
Dante--the real journey will
begin with Canto II.

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:37.290
It has 100 cantos,
but the basic unit of his

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.519
narrative is the number 3.
 

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:44.701
In fact, it's written in
so-called a style or a metrical

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.704
form,
but there're key devices,

00:04:46.704 --> 00:04:49.983
a so-called terza rima,
that I'm sure you recall from

00:04:49.983 --> 00:04:52.819
your own readings in high school
or in other courses,

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.779
the terza rima,
which is the rhyme scheme,

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:58.910
it's always going to be A,
B, A, B, C, B and so on.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:06.023
Number 3 once again is the
fundamental symbolic number of

00:05:06.023 --> 00:05:09.579
division within this text.
 

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:10.829
What is the reason for this?
 

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:14.521
There is a large aesthetic
reason and the aesthetic reason

00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:19.509
that it can be found formulated,
crystallized in a verse from

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.744
the Book of Wisdom,
"You O God,

00:05:22.744 --> 00:05:26.180
have created everything
according to number,

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.910
measure and weight."
 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.819
And so the Divine Comedy
has to duplicate the symmetry

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.685
and the order,
and the harmony that he thinks

00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:37.509
he sees in the universe.
 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.165
The poem is presented and
introduced as a reflection of

00:05:42.165 --> 00:05:45.786
that superior,
divine order of the universe

00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:48.459
and wants to be part of it.
 

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:52.992
So it's both as this kind of
ambivalence to reflect it and

00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:57.444
become what we call a metonymy:
the part that wants to be

00:05:57.444 --> 00:05:59.910
attached to a larger whole.
 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.754
So these are the--some general
concerns that you've got to have

00:06:03.754 --> 00:06:06.589
about the poem,
some general ideas that will

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:10.461
help you understand the pattern
of parallelisms that we're going

00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:12.120
to find within the poem.
 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.810
And I can give you one very
quickly now.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.302
Since I'm really asking you
that when you read the poem,

00:06:18.302 --> 00:06:22.240
you should be aware that it's a
kind of linear structure from 1

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.939
to 100.
 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:28.230
And yet, within the triple--the
tri-partition of the poem --

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.093
Hell,
Purgatory,

00:06:29.093 --> 00:06:31.642
and Paradise --
there are cantos that

00:06:31.642 --> 00:06:34.000
correspond to one another.
 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.363
Canto VI of Inferno,
it prefigures Canto VI of

00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:40.339
Purgatorio and both of
them in turn,

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:42.220
will prefigure Canto VI of
Paradise,

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.810
Canto VII and so on.
 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.927
It can be done,
Canto X, X and X,

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:48.839
it can be done in a fairly
systematic way.

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:52.747
If you wish sometimes you could
really read I,

00:06:52.747 --> 00:06:56.569
II, III, IV and yet I,
I, and I which is--

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:00.286
or maybe you wait for the end
of the poem when you have read

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:04.192
the whole poem then you can go
back and read it horizontally as

00:07:04.192 --> 00:07:06.649
it were as much as vertically
down.

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:09.584
These are some ideas,
general concerns and

00:07:09.584 --> 00:07:13.019
implications in Dante's
structure of the poem.

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:17.430
We begin now with Canto I;
it's a very well-known canto

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.908
where the--it's the general
preamble--you know how the poem

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:22.680
starts.
 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.456
It's--I'm just reading the
famous lines,

00:07:25.456 --> 00:07:29.089
everybody reads and everybody
probably remembers.

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:33.158
"In the middle of the
journey of our life,

00:07:33.158 --> 00:07:35.370
I came to myself."
 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.500
Those of you who have a
different translation will

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.463
nonetheless get the gist and the
changes, the shifts are really

00:07:42.463 --> 00:07:43.230
minimal.
 

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.588
"I came to myself within a
dark wood where the straight way

00:07:47.588 --> 00:07:48.350
was lost.
 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.762
Ah, how hard a thing it is to
tell of that wood,

00:07:52.762 --> 00:07:58.113
savage and harsh and dense,
the thought of which renews my

00:07:58.113 --> 00:07:58.959
fear!
 

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:03.588
So bitter it is that death is
hardly more.

00:08:03.588 --> 00:08:08.384
But to give account of the good
which I found there I will tell

00:08:08.384 --> 00:08:11.170
of the other things I noted
there.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.278
I cannot rightly tell how I
entered there.

00:08:15.278 --> 00:08:19.410
I was so full of sleep at that
moment when I left the true way;

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.622
but when I had reached the foot
of the hill at the end of that

00:08:23.622 --> 00:08:27.627
valley which had pierced my
heart with fear I looked up and

00:08:27.627 --> 00:08:31.357
saw its shoulders already
clothed with the beams of the

00:08:31.357 --> 00:08:34.879
planet that leads man straight
on every road.

00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:39.150
Then the fear was quieted a
little which had continued in

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:44.110
the lake of my heart during the
night I had spent so piteously;

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.673
and as he who with laboring
breath has escaped from the deep

00:08:48.673 --> 00:08:52.928
to the shore turns to the
perilous waters and gazes,

00:08:52.928 --> 00:08:57.494
so my mind which was still in
flight turned back to look again

00:08:57.494 --> 00:09:01.460
at the pass which never yet let
any go alive."

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.460
It's a great beginning.
 

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.149
It begins in a very
extraordinary way;

00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:09.556
it begins with--in the middle
to begin with,

00:09:09.556 --> 00:09:10.190
right?
 

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.105
That's--the beginning is in the
middle, the beginning is the

00:09:14.105 --> 00:09:17.624
present reality of the pilgrim
who finds himself lost,

00:09:17.624 --> 00:09:20.080
but it's more in that first
line.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.172
"In the middle of the
journey of our life"--what

00:09:24.172 --> 00:09:25.250
is he saying?
 

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.849
I think it's fairly clear the
first conceit and the

00:09:28.849 --> 00:09:33.240
fundamental conceit of the poem
is that life is a journey,

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.678
which means that we are always
on the way.

00:09:35.678 --> 00:09:37.460
I don't know where we are going
yet.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.958
He will find out soon,
which means that we are

00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.235
displaced, which means that we
are going to have a number of

00:09:43.235 --> 00:09:44.070
adventures.
 

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.860
It means that we are not yet
where we want to be.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.759
Life is a journey.
 

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:51.298
In fact, he will go on--not
only go in the middle of the

00:09:51.298 --> 00:09:53.567
journey;
he also calls it our

00:09:53.567 --> 00:09:53.970
life.
 

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.168
That possessive,
"our"

00:09:56.168 --> 00:09:59.220
life, it's his way of
establishing one fact,

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.908
that this is not really yet a
unique experience.

00:10:02.908 --> 00:10:06.280
It's something we all share and
something which might also

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.048
concern us.
 

00:10:07.048 --> 00:10:10.027
That we are also,
not only he is in the journey

00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:13.716
of his life, but we too are in
that journey of--the common

00:10:13.716 --> 00:10:15.269
journey of our life.
 

00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:18.494
Then in contrast to that,
there is now an

00:10:18.494 --> 00:10:20.509
autobiographical focus.
 

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:23.721
There is a stress of
"I found,"

00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:27.344
"I came to myself
within a dark wood"

00:10:27.344 --> 00:10:29.476
and so on,
"I,"

00:10:29.476 --> 00:10:31.850
so this is going to be very
much the story,

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.789
once again, very much as the
Vita nuova,

00:10:33.789 --> 00:10:35.558
an autobiographical story.
 

00:10:35.558 --> 00:10:38.836
It can only be a personal
story, but here the self is

00:10:38.836 --> 00:10:42.868
going to see the world--is going
to see himself through the prism

00:10:42.868 --> 00:10:43.940
of the world.
 

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.480
He will enter a public space.
 

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.524
The great difference,
I will say, between the Vita

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:52.042
nuova which we just looked
at last time,

00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:54.970
and the Divine Comedy is
the following.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.240
The Vita nuova was
destined to fail as a narrative,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:06.042
exactly because the protagonist
went on drawing us and drawing

00:11:06.042 --> 00:11:13.418
himself within the solitude,
the interiority of his own life;

00:11:13.418 --> 00:11:17.639
a life which was completely
disengaged from the concerns for

00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:19.070
the outside world.
 

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.649
The Divine Comedy starts
exactly with that kind of

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:24.971
shipwreck,
the shipwreck of some other

00:11:24.971 --> 00:11:28.450
intellectual activities that he
will go on describing and I will

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.610
describe with you.
 

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.840
As soon as we read this first
line,

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.105
"I came to myself in a
dark wood,"

00:11:34.105 --> 00:11:36.899
and if you read a lot of
traditional commentators,

00:11:36.899 --> 00:11:39.029
traditional commentators will
tell you,

00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:41.690
oh well Dante is here in a
state of sin,

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.950
the dark wood is really the
condition of spiritual--

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.360
maybe despair.
 

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.105
He's at an impasse;
we know he doesn't know where

00:11:51.105 --> 00:11:51.538
to go.
 

00:11:51.538 --> 00:11:55.181
I think that this allegorizing
is a little bit too easy and

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:58.697
it's not really--we have no
evidence for this in the poem

00:11:58.697 --> 00:11:59.200
yet.
 

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.921
We don't know,
but what we do know is that

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:05.240
Dante is lost in a landscape
that is terrifying.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:10.192
He is caught within it;
he's clueless about how he got

00:12:10.192 --> 00:12:10.788
there.
 

00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:12.590
I don't even know how--he goes
on to say,

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.629
I don't know how I got myself
in that situation,

00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:19.186
whatever that situation was,
but he knows one thing that he

00:12:19.186 --> 00:12:20.720
wants to get out of it.
 

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.620
He understands that.
 

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.197
He does not yet know how he to
get out of this situation,

00:12:26.197 --> 00:12:30.095
but he knows that he has to get
out of the entanglement of the

00:12:30.095 --> 00:12:30.668
wood.
 

00:12:30.668 --> 00:12:33.029
Then he goes on,
oh how hard it is,

00:12:33.029 --> 00:12:36.710
etc., "so bitter is that
death is hardly more.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.649
But to give account" --
that's the next tercet --

00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:44.062
"of the good which I've
found there I will tell of other

00:12:44.062 --> 00:12:46.269
things I noted there."
 

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:48.928
In a way, the poem is already
over.

00:12:48.928 --> 00:12:53.197
He's now shifting from the
narrative of events:

00:12:53.197 --> 00:12:57.741
I was lost in the dense,
savage, harsh wood of the

00:12:57.741 --> 00:12:58.668
night.
 

00:12:58.668 --> 00:13:03.070
His gaze rends this night,
tries to find out;

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.393
he cannot see anything beyond
himself, and then immediately

00:13:06.393 --> 00:13:09.945
says, but to tell you the good I
noted there I have to tell you

00:13:09.945 --> 00:13:10.918
other things.
 

00:13:10.918 --> 00:13:14.086
The poem has,
right from the start,

00:13:14.086 --> 00:13:16.788
the double narrative focus.
 

00:13:16.788 --> 00:13:21.600
The first focus is that he's
going to tell us the story of a

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.231
pilgrim who is caught in the--
what we call the diachronic,

00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:29.962
the time-bound,
the daily events--a number of

00:13:29.962 --> 00:13:35.230
encounters which he cannot quite
decide as to their meaning.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.126
So he's led by Virgil as we're
going to find out soon,

00:13:38.126 --> 00:13:40.970
but he doesn't understand
what's happening to him.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.104
Then there is the second focus
and it's the focus of the poet

00:13:45.104 --> 00:13:49.376
who has seen it all and enjoys
what we would call an omniscient

00:13:49.376 --> 00:13:50.480
perspective.
 

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.081
The whole poem really moves
around this double axis:

00:13:55.081 --> 00:14:00.307
the axis of a synchronic view,
synoptic view of the poet who

00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:02.495
has seen,
who has--he becomes a poet

00:14:02.495 --> 00:14:04.860
because the pilgrim has had this
experience,

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.850
and then he goes on telling us
about this experience.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.751
That's what I call a synoptic
and omniscient narrator and then

00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:15.080
he looks at the--at what the
pilgrim did not know.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.494
There's a kind of irony in this
discrepancy between the

00:14:19.494 --> 00:14:23.663
diachronic viewpoint of the
pilgrim and the synoptic

00:14:23.663 --> 00:14:25.788
viewpoint of the poet.
 

00:14:25.788 --> 00:14:30.418
It goes without saying that the
structure is not that neat,

00:14:30.418 --> 00:14:33.490
you will see that there are
moments when Dante will go on--

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.529
one's point of view will
encroach upon the other,

00:14:36.529 --> 00:14:39.591
so I will tell you more about
this particular structure and

00:14:39.591 --> 00:14:41.230
now he starts this narrative.
 

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.340
Let's see what has happened.
 

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.686
"I cannot tell how,"
this is the second paragraph of

00:14:46.686 --> 00:14:49.424
our translation,
"I cannot rightly tell how

00:14:49.424 --> 00:14:51.907
I entered there,
I was so full of sleep at that

00:14:51.907 --> 00:14:52.690
moment."
 

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.874
It's a kind of torpid
lethargic, the lack of

00:14:55.874 --> 00:14:57.725
consciousness,
the lack of

00:14:57.725 --> 00:15:02.241
any--everything--his faculties
are dormant -- let's paraphrase

00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:03.649
it like that.
 

00:15:03.649 --> 00:15:06.344
"When I left the true way;
but when I reach the foot of

00:15:06.344 --> 00:15:09.187
the hill at the end of that
valley which had pierced my

00:15:09.187 --> 00:15:12.135
heart with fear I looked up and
saw the shoulders already

00:15:12.135 --> 00:15:15.347
clothed within the beams of the
planet that leads men straight

00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:16.769
on every road."
 

00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:22.320
What he does -- dawn has come,
dawn breaks,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.850
and he looks up toward the sun
believing that the natural

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:33.775
sunlight is going to unveil to
him the layout of the land and

00:15:33.775 --> 00:15:39.899
he may find an escape route from
this particular disaster.

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:44.830
I'll tell you one thing,
that if this were a Platonic

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.950
narrative the poem would come to
an end right here,

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.490
because this is what happens in
a Platonic narrative.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.222
You are in a cave,
you know we are all--this is a

00:15:55.222 --> 00:15:57.330
famous myth of the
Republic;

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.224
we see nothing,
we only see flickers of light,

00:16:00.224 --> 00:16:03.312
it's like being at the movies,
flickers of light,

00:16:03.312 --> 00:16:04.019
unreal.
 

00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:06.178
They are simulations of the
truth;

00:16:06.178 --> 00:16:10.200
they are being projected on the
side of the cave,

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.970
and we mistake those shadows
for realities.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.836
If you are really wise and you
are a philosopher then you do

00:16:17.836 --> 00:16:21.836
know that you can turn your neck
around and find out where the

00:16:21.836 --> 00:16:25.178
source of true light is and then
you are saved.

00:16:25.178 --> 00:16:29.649
The whole experience of the
cave is predicated on this

00:16:29.649 --> 00:16:34.879
premise: that knowledge saves
you, that knowledge is virtue.

00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:39.456
And knowledge does save you to
the extent in which it really

00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:43.802
can heal what one could call the
wounds of the intellect:

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:48.690
ignorance being the wound of an
intellect which knowledge,

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.940
learning, education,
philosophy, can really cure.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:57.200
Dante will find out very
quickly that that is a false

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.370
promise;
that in many ways,

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.727
there are realities and that
his own realities are going to

00:17:03.727 --> 00:17:08.608
be a little bit more complex
than what one can find in books,

00:17:08.608 --> 00:17:11.709
manuals of philosophy,
about how we get saved and how

00:17:11.709 --> 00:17:13.140
we can save ourselves.
 

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.298
Let's see what he says here and
what happens.

00:17:15.298 --> 00:17:18.858
So he sees--he turns toward the
light,

00:17:18.858 --> 00:17:24.660
I saw already that the sunlight
and then he feared this passion,

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.440
because it's a passion of the
soul,

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:32.118
the fear that paralyzes him and
paralyzes his discernment.

00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:36.250
He cannot--it literally stops
him, does not know which way to

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.104
go and it's the overpowering
passion at this point of the

00:17:40.104 --> 00:17:44.028
poem was quieted a little
"which had continued in the

00:17:44.028 --> 00:17:46.988
lake of my heart during the
night I spent so

00:17:46.988 --> 00:17:48.640
piteously."
 

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.858
It's a dark night.
 

00:17:49.858 --> 00:17:53.153
Some mystics--Dante is not a
mystic, but he's clearly

00:17:53.153 --> 00:17:54.990
alluding to the dark night.
 

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.652
This is the dark night of the
soul, this is a spiritual

00:17:57.652 --> 00:18:01.435
experience that has found now;
it's coming to a head,

00:18:01.435 --> 00:18:02.740
if you wish.
 

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.310
"And it is he who with
laboring breath his escape from

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.150
the deep to the shore turns to
the perilous waters and gazes,

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.769
so my mind, which was still in
flight."

00:18:10.769 --> 00:18:14.405
Through the whole passage,
I have to tell you,

00:18:14.405 --> 00:18:18.769
the two paragraphs we read is
replete with neo-Platonic

00:18:18.769 --> 00:18:19.818
language.
 

00:18:19.818 --> 00:18:24.323
He is talking about himself as
if this were a flight of the

00:18:24.323 --> 00:18:26.420
soul, flight of the mind.
 

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.314
My mind which was still in
flight, this is the idea that we

00:18:29.314 --> 00:18:31.808
have experiences which are
purely intellectual,

00:18:31.808 --> 00:18:35.201
the kind of experiences that we
can all find when we are reading

00:18:35.201 --> 00:18:36.446
a book,
we are studying,

00:18:36.446 --> 00:18:37.200
we are thinking.
 

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.809
The mind takes its flight;
i.e., this is an intellectual

00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:42.680
problem.
 

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.531
There are many other terms here
that remind us of the--his use,

00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:49.390
his deliberate use of
neo-Platonic language.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.210
For instance the word wood
which is in the Latin--

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:56.112
in the Italian is selva,
which translates the Greek

00:18:56.112 --> 00:18:58.232
hyle,
which as you know,

00:18:58.232 --> 00:19:01.817
is the primal matter out of
which the demiurge will form and

00:19:01.817 --> 00:19:02.848
shape reality.
 

00:19:02.848 --> 00:19:06.839
Yet, immediately there is a
great shift that I want to focus

00:19:06.839 --> 00:19:07.720
on briefly.
 

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.371
"After I had rested my
wearied frame for a little,

00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:14.143
I took my way again over the
desert slope,

00:19:14.143 --> 00:19:16.778
keeping always the lower foot
firm;

00:19:16.778 --> 00:19:19.650
and lo, almost at the beginning
of the steep,

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:23.500
a leopard light and very swift,
covered with a spotted hide,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.662
and it did not go from before
my face but so impeded my way

00:19:27.662 --> 00:19:30.818
that I turned many times to go
back."

00:19:30.818 --> 00:19:35.088
He has been just now talking
about the flight of the mind;

00:19:35.088 --> 00:19:36.808
"my mind was still in
flight."

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:39.854
It's an experience of a
shipwreck, first of all,

00:19:39.854 --> 00:19:42.509
that many epic stories begin
like that.

00:19:42.509 --> 00:19:46.388
Think of the Aeneid,
the shipwreck of Aeneas on the

00:19:46.388 --> 00:19:50.539
shores of Africa as he is about
to enter the city that Dido is

00:19:50.539 --> 00:19:54.555
about to build and that will
bring him to a great revelation

00:19:54.555 --> 00:19:57.210
and a great love story with
Dido.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.650
Here there's no such a relief
for him.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.641
It's the shipwreck of the mind,
a mind that seems to be

00:20:03.641 --> 00:20:07.633
literally unable to define both
his whereabouts and his

00:20:07.633 --> 00:20:10.305
destination,
but as soon as he does this,

00:20:10.305 --> 00:20:13.338
as soon as he understands that
that's what the problem is,

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:16.890
he shifts the language from
mind to body.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.978
"My wearied body,"
and this is the great

00:20:19.978 --> 00:20:23.824
difference between neo-Platonic
narratives and Dante's kind of

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:24.769
experience.
 

00:20:24.769 --> 00:20:29.131
The intrusion of body and what
is the body--what does the body

00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:29.990
stand for?
 

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:35.288
The body stands for the limit
of purely intellectual journeys.

00:20:35.288 --> 00:20:40.378
The real journey that he has to
undertake is the journey of mind

00:20:40.378 --> 00:20:45.224
and body, and the body stands
for the irreducible historicity

00:20:45.224 --> 00:20:46.680
of one's self.
 

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.380
The body stands for one's own
reality, the passions;

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.358
it stands for one's own will.
 

00:20:54.358 --> 00:20:58.134
This is the difference between
what the Greeks understand as

00:20:58.134 --> 00:21:00.440
the great intellectual
adventure,

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.012
which is one of knowledge,
and Dante's idea that the real

00:21:04.012 --> 00:21:06.308
problems are problems of the
will.

00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:09.598
We may know all where we are
and we all may understand that

00:21:09.598 --> 00:21:12.832
we are not happy with the
situation that we find ourselves

00:21:12.832 --> 00:21:15.857
with,
but we cannot quite solve it by

00:21:15.857 --> 00:21:20.299
knowledge because the problems
are problems of willing.

00:21:20.299 --> 00:21:22.509
What is he doing?
 

00:21:22.509 --> 00:21:24.298
Let me just try to make this
very simple.

00:21:24.298 --> 00:21:27.354
There are two schemes,
I'm really simplifying it too,

00:21:27.354 --> 00:21:30.173
because I think this is
dramatic enough in and of

00:21:30.173 --> 00:21:30.818
itself.
 

00:21:30.818 --> 00:21:34.368
I don't have to overdo it with
unnecessary complications.

00:21:34.368 --> 00:21:41.998
There is a Socratic scheme
whereby all issues are issues of

00:21:41.998 --> 00:21:44.759
intellectual sorts.
 

00:21:44.759 --> 00:21:47.940
I know, and therefore I am
virtuous.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:54.248
I know what justice is and the
implication is:

00:21:54.248 --> 00:21:55.788
I'm just.
 

00:21:55.788 --> 00:21:59.063
That's a false implication
because if I go around the room

00:21:59.063 --> 00:22:01.818
here and ask you all to give me
a definition,

00:22:01.818 --> 00:22:03.730
of each and every one of you of
justice,

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.059
you'll all tell me something:
that justice is a justice

00:22:06.059 --> 00:22:08.472
within the self,
that justice is a way I relate

00:22:08.472 --> 00:22:10.590
to my family,
or justice is a way I relate to

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.880
the city,
or justice is a way I take care

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.640
of the problems or whatever of
the world that I find myself in.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.713
Dante will say this is not the
knowledge of what--the

00:22:20.713 --> 00:22:24.240
definition of justice cannot
make you just.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.838
The issue is one of willing,
desire.

00:22:28.838 --> 00:22:32.355
The other scheme that Dante
opposes to the Socratic idea

00:22:32.355 --> 00:22:35.680
that all issues are issues of
philosophy or issues of

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.788
knowledge is one of the will.
 

00:22:37.788 --> 00:22:41.090
In the Letter to the Romans,
St.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:45.563
Paul writes,
"The good that I will do,

00:22:45.563 --> 00:22:47.798
that I do not do.
 

00:22:47.798 --> 00:22:51.259
The evil that I would do that I
do."

00:22:51.259 --> 00:22:54.471
He draws attention to the
essential existential problem,

00:22:54.471 --> 00:22:55.990
the problem of the self.
 

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.338
My will is divided against
itself.

00:22:59.338 --> 00:23:04.060
The only way I may know what to
do, but I do not know really,

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.130
I am not sure that I will,
I will it.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:08.680
That's the fatality of life.
 

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.980
We all know what's good.
 

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:13.731
How many of us go around
choosing and doing what we know

00:23:13.731 --> 00:23:17.144
it's not good for us,
it's not the best in terms of

00:23:17.144 --> 00:23:19.259
our judgment of situations.
 

00:23:19.259 --> 00:23:23.097
So it's willing and the
perspective of the will becomes

00:23:23.097 --> 00:23:27.433
Dante's perspective in coming to
terms with the limitations of

00:23:27.433 --> 00:23:30.420
philosophy and intellectual
knowledge.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:35.269
We shall see Dante talks about
the will in a number of ways.

00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:37.578
Last time, talking about the
Vita nuova,

00:23:37.578 --> 00:23:41.347
I began mentioning to you that
the will is even better of

00:23:41.347 --> 00:23:45.467
course for him than unwilling,
and yet the best experiences of

00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:49.140
life seem to be those of one
does not want to happen to us;

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.066
such as a dream,
for instance,

00:23:51.066 --> 00:23:55.051
the dream of falling in love or
sometimes in the death of the

00:23:55.051 --> 00:23:55.848
beloved.
 

00:23:55.848 --> 00:24:00.348
You don't--he certainly did not
want the death of Beatrice.

00:24:00.348 --> 00:24:04.842
It's a way of understanding
that unwilling is as compelling

00:24:04.842 --> 00:24:05.848
as willing.
 

00:24:05.848 --> 00:24:11.116
And yet he understands that as
soon as he focuses on Beatrice

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:14.295
as the figure,
the real contingent historical

00:24:14.295 --> 00:24:17.479
figure of love,
that he has to give a direction

00:24:17.479 --> 00:24:21.061
to his own desires,
that he has to define the

00:24:21.061 --> 00:24:24.490
will--it's--
you understand what I'm saying?

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.950
He understands that too.
 

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:31.550
That's already an anticipation
of what--of the problems of the

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:32.078
will.
 

00:24:32.078 --> 00:24:34.450
Now he starts exploring other
problems,

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.997
which we shall see,
both as they relate to the

00:24:36.997 --> 00:24:38.576
self,
to the psychology of the

00:24:38.576 --> 00:24:40.546
character,
but also as they relate to

00:24:40.546 --> 00:24:41.788
politics for instance.
 

00:24:41.788 --> 00:24:45.594
To a vision of the world as an
act of and the projection of our

00:24:45.594 --> 00:24:47.911
own will;
that the world is the way we

00:24:47.911 --> 00:24:50.449
want it to be,
and that men are too--to the

00:24:50.449 --> 00:24:53.818
way in which we relate to
problems which are of problems--

00:24:53.818 --> 00:24:56.144
necessary problems,
the problems of reality,

00:24:56.144 --> 00:24:56.470
etc.
 

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:00.971
For the time being though,
Dante takes the will as his

00:25:00.971 --> 00:25:04.368
own, or the body,
his own perspective.

00:25:04.368 --> 00:25:09.980
He finds out that he cannot go
up the hill that he has seen.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.130
Three beasts,
just paraphrasing the text,

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:17.061
a leopard, a she-wolf,
a lion, and the lion and the

00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:21.938
she-wolf will block his journey
up and so he's going right back

00:25:21.938 --> 00:25:26.342
where he finds himself and he's
now back into the deepest

00:25:26.342 --> 00:25:31.690
despair possible because there
seems to be now really no exit.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:36.391
Then he sees something,
"when I was rushing down

00:25:36.391 --> 00:25:40.336
to the place below,
there appeared before my eyes

00:25:40.336 --> 00:25:43.509
one whose voice seemed weak from
long silence.

00:25:43.509 --> 00:25:46.930
When I saw him in that great
waste," and as you know,

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:50.269
because this is the first words
that Dante will say,

00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:53.534
the pilgrim,
"have pity on me whoever

00:25:53.534 --> 00:25:55.218
thou art,
I cried to him,

00:25:55.218 --> 00:25:56.529
shade or a real man."
 

00:25:56.529 --> 00:26:00.039
These are the words taken from
Psalms,

00:26:00.039 --> 00:26:04.123
"misere" --
he's prostrating -- of King

00:26:04.123 --> 00:26:06.568
David,
so he's prostrating himself and

00:26:06.568 --> 00:26:09.586
I stress this because the voice,
the Davidic voice will

00:26:09.586 --> 00:26:12.559
constitute an important strain
in this narrative.

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:14.318
How does Dante talk?
 

00:26:14.318 --> 00:26:17.644
That's one of the ways and we
shall see how discretely it will

00:26:17.644 --> 00:26:21.077
appear further down in the poem
and now the conversation what he

00:26:21.077 --> 00:26:24.608
meets is--
the fear he meets is Virgil.

00:26:24.608 --> 00:26:27.900
"Not man,
once I was a man."

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.846
Look at what--we can stop a
little bit to reflect on what

00:26:31.846 --> 00:26:35.863
this experience here has been
like and can we define it in

00:26:35.863 --> 00:26:36.848
some ways.
 

00:26:36.848 --> 00:26:40.430
Dante finds himself lost in the
landscape.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.670
He does not know how he got
there.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.380
He mistakes the sunlight,
the natural sunlight,

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:49.046
as the light of truth by
following which he thinks he can

00:26:49.046 --> 00:26:52.525
reach the plain of truth,
up to the top of the hill,

00:26:52.525 --> 00:26:56.320
the top of the mountain from
which he can survey the land and

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.419
find the exit,
find an escape,

00:26:58.419 --> 00:27:00.568
find a transcendence,
we'll call it.

00:27:00.568 --> 00:27:03.680
Let's call it a way of getting
out of that disentanglement.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.558
Then he comes right back.
 

00:27:05.558 --> 00:27:08.240
He sees the three beasts that
we don't know what they are.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.309
Are they sins?
 

00:27:10.309 --> 00:27:12.190
Are they dispositions to sins?
 

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:15.086
They are animals and therefore
they stand for animal

00:27:15.086 --> 00:27:17.920
projections of our desires,
of his desires,

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.009
the she-wolf,
the lion and the leopard,

00:27:21.009 --> 00:27:22.410
that's all we can see about
them.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:25.730
Then he meets a figure that
can't even know if it's a shade

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:26.358
or a man.
 

00:27:26.358 --> 00:27:29.846
He's dramatizing what a
medieval thought,

00:27:29.846 --> 00:27:34.500
a medieval literature;
it's called the land of

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.180
dissimilitude,
the land of an unlikeness.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:43.071
He finds himself in a world
where things are not what they

00:27:43.071 --> 00:27:43.548
seem.
 

00:27:43.548 --> 00:27:46.108
Where there seems to be a
disparity between,

00:27:46.108 --> 00:27:49.190
let's call it--let's use the
literary language,

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:51.896
with the signs and
things--signs and their

00:27:51.896 --> 00:27:54.710
meanings,
things and what they stand for

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:58.548
and part of this effort is to
literally stitch this to,

00:27:58.548 --> 00:28:02.328
this break between signs and
symbols,

00:28:02.328 --> 00:28:05.250
meanings and signs,
stitch them together.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:09.292
First meeting then is with this
figure by the name of Virgil,

00:28:09.292 --> 00:28:11.180
who will become his guide.
 

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.019
No man, you know who he is.
 

00:28:13.019 --> 00:28:15.098
He's the author of the
Aeneid, but look how he

00:28:15.098 --> 00:28:15.858
presents himself.
 

00:28:15.858 --> 00:28:18.730
I think it's crucial you pay
attention: "Not man;

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:22.973
once I was man,
and my parents were Lombards,

00:28:22.973 --> 00:28:25.288
both Mantuan by birth.
 

00:28:25.288 --> 00:28:27.215
I was born sub
Iulio,"

00:28:27.215 --> 00:28:28.909
meaning Caesar,
which is true,

00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:31.477
"though,
late in his time and I lived in

00:28:31.477 --> 00:28:32.470
Rome."
 

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:36.615
And he gives a biography of
himself, a self-presentation in

00:28:36.615 --> 00:28:39.904
terms of his life,
the historical circumstances

00:28:39.904 --> 00:28:41.548
and also his works.
 

00:28:41.548 --> 00:28:46.060
That's what we call a miniature
biography: a sense that I came

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.279
into this world and somehow.
 

00:28:48.279 --> 00:28:51.660
This is what it all comes down
to, this is really the sense of

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.210
my birth, and he speaks about
his own birth.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.594
"I lived in Rome under the
good Augustus in the time of the

00:28:57.594 --> 00:28:58.828
false and lying gods.
 

00:28:58.828 --> 00:29:01.627
I was a poet,
and sang of that just son of

00:29:01.627 --> 00:29:04.494
Anchises,"
Aeneas, "who came from

00:29:04.494 --> 00:29:07.089
Troy after proud Iliam was
burned.

00:29:07.089 --> 00:29:08.230
But you?
 

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:12.348
Why are you returning to such
misery?

00:29:12.348 --> 00:29:15.500
Why dost thou not climb the
delectable mountain which is the

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.009
beginning and cause of all
happiness?"--

00:29:18.009 --> 00:29:20.788
meaning the Mountain of
Purgatory that will take him to

00:29:20.788 --> 00:29:23.556
Eden--
which is really what all things

00:29:23.556 --> 00:29:27.279
according to the biblical
version of cosmology,

00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:28.650
all things started.
 

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.692
He'll say, "art thou then
that Virgil the fountain which

00:29:32.692 --> 00:29:35.319
pours forth so rich stream of
speech?

00:29:35.319 --> 00:29:38.163
I answered,"
etc., "O glory and light

00:29:38.163 --> 00:29:40.442
of other poets,
let the long study and the

00:29:40.442 --> 00:29:43.670
great love that has made me
search thy volume avail me.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.808
Thou art my master and my
author.

00:29:45.808 --> 00:29:48.761
Thou art he from whom I took
the style whose beauty has

00:29:48.761 --> 00:29:50.130
brought me honor."
 

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:53.490
This is Virgil,
clearly, the poet.

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.108
And the extraordinary
recommendation,

00:29:56.108 --> 00:29:59.182
which I can tell you as a
teacher, every teacher really

00:29:59.182 --> 00:30:01.893
would love,
years after the students have

00:30:01.893 --> 00:30:05.396
been studying with the teacher,
to give them this kind of great

00:30:05.396 --> 00:30:07.410
acknowledgement:
how I remember your teaching.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.380
That's what he does,
very rhetorical;

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:14.621
we'll call it the rhetoric of
capturing the benevolence of the

00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:15.910
interlocutor.
 

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:20.067
It's clear that the exchange
between them and the recognition

00:30:20.067 --> 00:30:23.297
of Virgil is as a poet,
and therefore I have to take a

00:30:23.297 --> 00:30:25.630
few minutes to tell you a little
bit about this.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:29.001
It's--because Virgil,
we know, he's the poet of

00:30:29.001 --> 00:30:32.594
the Aeneid,
clearly the story of a journey,

00:30:32.594 --> 00:30:35.380
of a grand epic journey by
Aeneas.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:39.038
We'll talk a lot about it;
I hope you've been reading that

00:30:39.038 --> 00:30:40.799
poem, if you haven't already.
 

00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:44.009
That's not the way he was known.
 

00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:48.286
Virgil was not known this way
in, what we call the

00:30:48.286 --> 00:30:52.563
twelfth-century Europe,
in the culture immediately

00:30:52.563 --> 00:30:54.920
preceding Dante's time.
 

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.872
He, Virgil, more than as a
poet, was known as a

00:30:59.872 --> 00:31:01.380
philosopher.
 

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.930
He was a neo-Platonic
philosopher.

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:07.134
That is to say,
a neo-Platonic philosopher is

00:31:07.134 --> 00:31:10.229
one who had written a poem,
but the substance of the poem

00:31:10.229 --> 00:31:12.858
was not the fiction about the
burning of Troy,

00:31:12.858 --> 00:31:17.233
the journey of Aeneas to--as an
exile who could go around

00:31:17.233 --> 00:31:22.390
looking for a new land with his
father on his back and the kid--

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:27.670
the Ascanius by his hand;
it was nothing like that.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.500
It really had some
philosophical depth.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.685
It was a way of acknowledging
that poetry is capable of

00:31:34.685 --> 00:31:37.710
providing philosophical
illumination.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.220
What was the philosophical
message?

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.351
I call it neo-Platonic,
because it was just very much

00:31:42.351 --> 00:31:44.686
like what they thought was the
Odyssey in that same

00:31:44.686 --> 00:31:47.425
time: the Odyssey,
the story of Odysseus or

00:31:47.425 --> 00:31:50.420
Ulysses, who goes from Ithaca to
Troy,

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:56.210
and then after ten years of the
war in Troy goes back to Ithaca.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:57.808
It takes him ten more years to
do that.

00:31:57.808 --> 00:32:00.803
The neo-Platonists,
the allegorizers,

00:32:00.803 --> 00:32:05.875
were viewing that poem as the
metaphor for the journey and the

00:32:05.875 --> 00:32:08.118
experience of the soul.
 

00:32:08.118 --> 00:32:11.435
It was the story of the soul
that goes from the point of

00:32:11.435 --> 00:32:13.615
origin,
one's home, one's home is

00:32:13.615 --> 00:32:16.450
always--we call once home a
place of one's--

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:20.720
where one's soul is--when one
can find oneself somehow and one

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.009
is familiar,
comfortable, whatever.

00:32:23.009 --> 00:32:26.079
He leaves Ithaca,
goes to Troy,

00:32:26.079 --> 00:32:30.038
goes through life,
and then he has to purify

00:32:30.038 --> 00:32:33.349
himself in order to go back,
as in a circle,

00:32:33.349 --> 00:32:37.230
a neo-Platonic circle back to
the point of origin.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.190
This is the neo-Platonic
allegory of the Odyssey.

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.068
They will do the same thing in
the twelfth-century France.

00:32:43.068 --> 00:32:46.650
I could give you names if you
wish: Bernard Sylvester,

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:50.048
Fulgentius a little bit
earlier, John of Salisbury who

00:32:50.048 --> 00:32:52.868
was an Englishmen of the twelfth
century,

00:32:52.868 --> 00:32:57.154
who will go on writing about
the Aeneid is the story

00:32:57.154 --> 00:33:01.663
of a hero who is born in Troy
and then goes through the stages

00:33:01.663 --> 00:33:02.548
of life.
 

00:33:02.548 --> 00:33:05.420
Each book represents a stage of
life: childhood,

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:09.054
youth, maturity,
with all the temptations of the

00:33:09.054 --> 00:33:13.538
flesh that happened with Dido
and then he goes back to--

00:33:13.538 --> 00:33:16.519
arrives in Italy and that's the
Book VI.

00:33:16.519 --> 00:33:18.980
They would never really bother
reading the other book.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.974
The Aeneid was viewed as
a philosophical text

00:33:22.974 --> 00:33:27.048
illustrating the pattern and the
movement of life.

00:33:27.048 --> 00:33:30.423
It was really telling us,
and that's really the promise

00:33:30.423 --> 00:33:33.670
of philosophical knowledge,
that we all,

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.410
like Aeneas,
are born,

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:40.720
but with care and prudence can
reach the Promised Land.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.611
Dante changes this
interpretation and he changes

00:33:44.611 --> 00:33:49.330
this interpretation by making
and insisting that you--that

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.068
Virgil is a poet.
 

00:33:51.068 --> 00:33:56.634
He replaces the philosophical
promises with the idea of poetry

00:33:56.634 --> 00:34:01.558
in the belief that poetry is
better than philosophy.

00:34:01.558 --> 00:34:04.936
That philosophy cannot quite
reach the depth of immense light

00:34:04.936 --> 00:34:07.640
that makes two general promises
for everybody.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:12.253
It tells that we can all be
like Aeneas, going from Troy to

00:34:12.253 --> 00:34:12.969
Latium.
 

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:16.579
And Dante says no;
this is not really saying much,

00:34:16.579 --> 00:34:20.634
but saying at all about the
reality and the individuality of

00:34:20.634 --> 00:34:21.389
my life.
 

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:24.856
Poetic language is for him,
the language that addresses

00:34:24.856 --> 00:34:26.588
these issues,
and therefore,

00:34:26.588 --> 00:34:29.670
poetry here is seen as a
version of history.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:32.864
This is--you are the writer,
he says to Virgil,

00:34:32.864 --> 00:34:36.199
who wrote the poem dealing with
Roman history.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:40.333
Poetry and history--they deal
with the world of contingency

00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:43.539
and not the world of universal,
and therefore,

00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:45.750
potentially empty promises.
 

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:50.827
That's the great change,
the great new interpretation

00:34:50.827 --> 00:34:54.539
that Dante's advancing about
Virgil.

00:34:54.539 --> 00:35:00.282
What Virgil will tell him is
that the--they go on talking

00:35:00.282 --> 00:35:04.795
about--Dante will call him
master and author,

00:35:04.795 --> 00:35:09.000
this is--and great sage and all
that.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.887
And Virgil says to him,
this is very simple,

00:35:12.887 --> 00:35:17.239
you must take another road;
you are going the wrong way.

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:21.708
This is the--that's what I call
the idea that Canto I is a

00:35:21.708 --> 00:35:24.059
rehearsal to the whole poem.
 

00:35:24.059 --> 00:35:28.221
It gives the story of a
journey, a journey that fails,

00:35:28.221 --> 00:35:32.539
a journey that is aborted,
that's not the way you go.

00:35:32.539 --> 00:35:35.000
It's not--you find yourself
lost, what do you do?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.393
You try to go quickly up to the
destination, you climb up the

00:35:40.393 --> 00:35:43.719
hill and you think you can make
it.

00:35:43.719 --> 00:35:44.909
No, no, no.
 

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:49.300
Virgil replies that he has to
go in a different way.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.190
He may reach the same point,
the same destination,

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.429
the world of justice,
the vision of God,

00:35:55.429 --> 00:35:58.840
the idea of love,
the good as he calls it,

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.230
but he must go down.
 

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:06.603
That the way up is down,
he has to go through the whole

00:36:06.603 --> 00:36:09.449
spiral,
through the horrors and the

00:36:09.449 --> 00:36:12.717
suffering of Hell,
then reemerge through Purgatory

00:36:12.717 --> 00:36:15.780
in order to be able to reach the
beatific vision.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.190
That's very simple.
 

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:21.940
The way up is down and this is
something that marks the

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:27.481
difference between philosophical
presumption and the notion of a

00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:32.672
spiritual Christian humility
that he has to pursue and wants

00:36:32.672 --> 00:36:34.079
to pursue.
 

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:40.144
This is--the conversation
between them goes on with this

00:36:40.144 --> 00:36:45.989
prophecy of the so-called hound,
page 27, line 100.

00:36:45.989 --> 00:36:48.820
It says, the world is in such a
disarray,

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.440
and yet now there's very
mysterious and enigmatic

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.769
prophecy that we'll come to and
discuss by the time we come to

00:36:54.769 --> 00:36:58.210
the end of Purgatory and
so now the journey begins,

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.559
"then he set out and they
came on behind him."

00:37:01.559 --> 00:37:04.989
That's the end of Canto I and
we come to Canto II,

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:08.210
where now it's--what's the time
of the year?

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:11.679
If this has to be a historical,
a reducible,

00:37:11.679 --> 00:37:16.681
and essentially a biographical
experience, Dante has to be very

00:37:16.681 --> 00:37:17.650
careful.
 

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:21.684
He will give us the time,
the precise time and place of

00:37:21.684 --> 00:37:23.030
this experience.
 

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:29.445
We are--the poem starts on Good
Friday, on the evening of Good

00:37:29.445 --> 00:37:32.179
Friday of the year 1300.
 

00:37:32.179 --> 00:37:36.420
These are the--so it's a very
Christo-mimetic we call it,

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.130
an imitation of Christ-like
experience,

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:42.559
because he will emerge to the
light of Purgatory on Easter

00:37:42.559 --> 00:37:43.260
Sunday.
 

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.253
Dante says, why should I take
this journey to

00:37:46.253 --> 00:37:49.519
extraordinary--you here--this is
the whole brunt,

00:37:49.519 --> 00:37:51.969
the whole substance of Canto
II.

00:37:51.969 --> 00:37:54.206
"I'm not Aeneas,"
he says, "I'm not

00:37:54.206 --> 00:37:54.800
Paul."
 

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.619
"Why should I go
there?"

00:37:56.619 --> 00:37:59.440
Why should I go on?
 

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.483
"You poet"
-- I'm on line 10,

00:38:01.483 --> 00:38:03.740
"you guidest me,
consider my strength,

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.139
if it is sufficient...
 

00:38:05.139 --> 00:38:09.182
You tell us of the father of
Sylvius as he went,"

00:38:09.182 --> 00:38:14.724
meaning of course Aeneas,
etc., and then you also tell us

00:38:14.724 --> 00:38:19.204
about the Paul and he concludes,
"but I,

00:38:19.204 --> 00:38:21.559
why should I go there,"
line 32.

00:38:21.559 --> 00:38:22.960
"Who grants it?
 

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.829
I'm not Aeneas,
I'm not Paul."

00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:28.300
First of all,
these are the coordinates,

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.469
the imaginative coordinates for
his own journey.

00:38:31.469 --> 00:38:35.681
Aeneas, the hero who brings
about the foundation of Rome and

00:38:35.681 --> 00:38:38.045
then Paul,
the Apostle to the Gentile,

00:38:38.045 --> 00:38:40.650
the thirteenth Apostle who
really brings about--

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:44.860
who also goes to Rome,
but he was also the spiritual

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.760
domain of the Church.
 

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.039
So these are the two--so who is
he?

00:38:49.039 --> 00:38:50.860
That's the first question he
must answer.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.230
"I'm not Aeneas,
I'm not Paul."

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.739
The implication is who am I?
 

00:38:55.739 --> 00:39:00.193
This whole part of this story
is to find out who he is and

00:39:00.193 --> 00:39:03.789
part of this journey is indeed
to find out--

00:39:03.789 --> 00:39:05.768
the beginning of this journey
at least,

00:39:05.768 --> 00:39:09.804
is to find out that the poem is
written in order to bring some

00:39:09.804 --> 00:39:12.980
degree of redemption and clarity
to the world.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:16.126
He really believes in this,
in what we call

00:39:16.126 --> 00:39:19.500
"salvific"
role of his own voice.

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:23.291
Not without irony,
not without discouragement,

00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:28.262
not without a sense that this
may indeed be a proud arrogant

00:39:28.262 --> 00:39:30.369
kind sort of posture.
 

00:39:30.369 --> 00:39:36.721
This whole idea about who he
is, is immediately countered by

00:39:36.721 --> 00:39:40.920
a reflection on his own divided
will.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.630
I just want to read this
thematically,

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.690
"and as one who one wills
what he willed,

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.949
and with new thoughts changes
his purpose,

00:39:47.949 --> 00:39:50.530
so that he quite withdraws from
what he has begun,

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:55.014
such I became on the dark slope;
for by thinking of it I brought

00:39:55.014 --> 00:39:57.576
to naught the enterprise that
was so hasty in its

00:39:57.576 --> 00:39:58.590
beginning."
 

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:02.956
It would take me really too
long to give you a sense of an

00:40:02.956 --> 00:40:05.639
appropriate gloss to these
lines.

00:40:05.639 --> 00:40:09.530
They are lines about the
limitations of willing.

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:13.355
Dante begins by claiming the
importance of the will in the

00:40:13.355 --> 00:40:17.179
act of knowledge and we do see
that he so aware of it--

00:40:17.179 --> 00:40:19.409
there's one detail that I did
not mention.

00:40:19.409 --> 00:40:23.121
You realize how the pilgrim
moves throughout in Canto I and

00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:27.409
he will move in the same way but
he'll never talk about it again.

00:40:27.409 --> 00:40:33.123
He hobbles in--toward the
light, he goes around hobbling

00:40:33.123 --> 00:40:38.320
and that hobbling is part of his
being wounded,

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.010
having a wounded will that he
must somehow heal.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.487
Someone will say,
good, Dante's a voluntarist,

00:40:44.487 --> 00:40:45.150
not quite.
 

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.905
Dante doesn't believe in
philosophy and intellect,

00:40:47.905 --> 00:40:48.579
not quite.
 

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:52.447
He believes that the two
faculties of the soul,

00:40:52.447 --> 00:40:56.233
intellect and will,
are like the feet of one's

00:40:56.233 --> 00:40:56.989
body.
 

00:40:56.989 --> 00:40:59.945
They got to--if you really want
to walk fast,

00:40:59.945 --> 00:41:03.239
at least, and safely,
you got to be using both.

00:41:03.239 --> 00:41:05.110
You got to use the intellect
and the will.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:07.800
As soon as he claims the
importance of the will,

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.659
which the Socratic experience
had somehow neglected,

00:41:11.659 --> 00:41:14.690
he goes on reflecting about the
limitations of the will.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:16.280
What are the limitations?
 

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.860
One of it is that the will can
be divided against itself.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:22.596
The second one is that the will
needs something to regulate it,

00:41:22.596 --> 00:41:25.791
because I can will anything,
I can will this and that,

00:41:25.791 --> 00:41:27.659
how do I order what I will?
 

00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:30.559
The third limitation of the
will, and we'll talk more about

00:41:30.559 --> 00:41:32.543
the--
some of these aspects but

00:41:32.543 --> 00:41:36.271
there's a third limitation of
the will is that I can never

00:41:36.271 --> 00:41:38.690
really go faster than my own
will.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.871
I'm a prisoner of my--if I
believe that that's all I have,

00:41:41.871 --> 00:41:44.050
my will -- I can't go faster
than it.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:47.465
If the will is weak and slow,
and divided,

00:41:47.465 --> 00:41:49.050
that's what I am.
 

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:53.909
I can't go past it,
some of the difficulties.

00:41:53.909 --> 00:41:57.273
Here he goes,
Canto II, trying to think about

00:41:57.273 --> 00:42:01.630
the identity and the purpose of
this journey--who am I?

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:04.407
"I'm not Aeneas,
I'm not Paul,"

00:42:04.407 --> 00:42:05.518
then who am I?
 

00:42:05.518 --> 00:42:09.570
That's the great question and
as soon as he does this,

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:16.523
he admits--he sheds light on
the first internal issue that he

00:42:16.523 --> 00:42:20.619
must cure,
the internal issue is the

00:42:20.619 --> 00:42:22.070
divided will.
 

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:25.226
We come to Canto III,
I'm sorry that we go a little

00:42:25.226 --> 00:42:28.320
fast but that's the way -- our
will moves fast.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:33.309
This is now Dante enters into
the gate of Hell,

00:42:33.309 --> 00:42:38.922
the famous inscription,
"Through me the way,"

00:42:38.922 --> 00:42:43.809
pretty scary and that scares
him quite a lot.

00:42:43.809 --> 00:42:49.994
Dante meets--the first sinners
that he meets are the so-called

00:42:49.994 --> 00:42:54.619
neutral angels,
Canto III, around lines 30 and

00:42:54.619 --> 00:42:56.619
following,
"And I,

00:42:56.619 --> 00:43:00.795
my head encircled with horror,
said: 'Master what is this I

00:43:00.795 --> 00:43:04.643
hear, and who are these people
who seem so mastered by their

00:43:04.643 --> 00:43:05.230
pain?'
 

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:08.335
And he said to me:
'This miserable state is borne

00:43:08.335 --> 00:43:12.219
by the wretched souls of those
who lived without disgrace and

00:43:12.219 --> 00:43:13.449
without praise.
 

00:43:13.449 --> 00:43:16.987
They are mixed with that
caitiff choir of the angels who

00:43:16.987 --> 00:43:20.440
were not rebels,
nor faithful to God,

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.762
but were--'my text says,
"for

00:43:23.762 --> 00:43:24.239
themselves."
 

00:43:24.239 --> 00:43:26.530
The right translation is,
"by

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.266
themselves,"
because if you are for

00:43:29.266 --> 00:43:31.429
yourself, you are for someone.
 

00:43:31.429 --> 00:43:36.666
These are the angels called
neutral who in the great cosmic

00:43:36.666 --> 00:43:41.452
battle with which the world
begins between God and the

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:45.867
satanic forces,
just became spectators,

00:43:45.867 --> 00:43:47.570
just watching.
 

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.380
The translation is per-
in Italian it says "per

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:53.005
se stessi,"
which we translate as "by

00:43:53.005 --> 00:43:55.309
themselves,"
sort of taking a separation.

00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:58.304
In other words,
Dante begins by dramatizing

00:43:58.304 --> 00:44:01.800
that which to him is the most
serious of sins,

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.829
not--being disengaged,
not taking sides,

00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:09.815
in the belief that somehow you
wait and see what the outcome is

00:44:09.815 --> 00:44:12.260
and then you can go on taking
sides.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:17.329
That's the start of this
experience and then he goes on--

00:44:17.329 --> 00:44:21.454
why are they--he responds,
"They have no hope of

00:44:21.454 --> 00:44:25.036
death,
etc., pity and justice despise

00:44:25.036 --> 00:44:25.610
them.
 

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:28.510
Let's not talk of them but look
at them and pass."

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:32.652
He doesn't even name them,
he won't even name them because

00:44:32.652 --> 00:44:36.648
to name them would be to bring
them into reality and the

00:44:36.648 --> 00:44:41.226
neutrality stands and is a sign
the way in which they de-realize

00:44:41.226 --> 00:44:42.389
the world.
 

00:44:42.389 --> 00:44:48.146
They reduce the world to a pure
show of their own--for their own

00:44:48.146 --> 00:44:49.610
spectatorship.
 

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:57.876
So, he goes on from here and
now the second action is that he

00:44:57.876 --> 00:45:03.625
sees Charon the famous--
he goes into the ferry,

00:45:03.625 --> 00:45:09.367
Charon who will ferry all the
souls and gives an extraordinary

00:45:09.367 --> 00:45:15.204
description of this figure and
the souls who blasphemed God and

00:45:15.204 --> 00:45:18.199
the parents,
the humankind.

00:45:18.199 --> 00:45:21.791
And then there is an
extraordinary image that I want

00:45:21.791 --> 00:45:25.878
to read with you when Dante
describes the souls and what he

00:45:25.878 --> 00:45:29.329
sees are souls that go on the
boat of Charon.

00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:33.860
This is toward the end of Canto
III, lines 112 and following.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:38.880
"As in autumn the leaves
drop off one after the other

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.550
until the branch sees all it
spoils on the ground,

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:50.990
so the wicked seed of Adam
fling themselves from that

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:55.014
shore,
one by one at the signal as a

00:45:55.014 --> 00:45:57.090
falcon at its recall.
 

00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:01.342
Thus, they depart,
of the dark water and behold of

00:46:01.342 --> 00:46:06.288
the land on the other side a
fresh crowd collects again on

00:46:06.288 --> 00:46:07.070
this.
 

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:09.940
'My son, said the courteous
master,

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.215
'all those that die in the
wrath of God assemble here from

00:46:13.215 --> 00:46:16.780
every land and they're eager to
cross the river,' etc."

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:22.590
I really want to focus on this
image of the autumn leaves,

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:27.293
whereby Dante describes the
dead souls as the leaves in

00:46:27.293 --> 00:46:30.780
autumn that have fallen from the
tree.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:36.286
The conceit is that the souls
are leaves, and it's an image

00:46:36.286 --> 00:46:42.079
that Dante takes straight from
the Aeneid of Virgil.

00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:45.728
In Book VI, also Virgil
describes--Book VI of the

00:46:45.728 --> 00:46:48.739
Aeneid,
focuses on the descent of

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:53.726
Aeneas into Hades and there he
also waits and he sees the souls

00:46:53.726 --> 00:46:57.612
waiting for reincarnation,
the famous theory of

00:46:57.612 --> 00:46:58.789
metempsychosis.
 

00:46:58.789 --> 00:47:01.795
You may have heard of this
term, which means the

00:47:01.795 --> 00:47:03.650
reincarnation of the souls.
 

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:07.032
The souls are waiting to be
reincarnated and come back in an

00:47:07.032 --> 00:47:07.949
endless cycle.
 

00:47:07.949 --> 00:47:12.914
Dante--Virgil himself had taken
this image from Homer,

00:47:12.914 --> 00:47:14.039
of course.
 

00:47:14.039 --> 00:47:18.523
Dante changes Virgil's,
the thrust of Virgil's image,

00:47:18.523 --> 00:47:22.920
because in Virgil it's quite
accurate since he has a

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:26.630
Pythagorean understanding of
existence.

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:30.376
That is to say,
life is a continuous circle,

00:47:30.376 --> 00:47:34.820
the wheel of becoming,
Plato's wheel of becoming.

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:38.869
Time goes on and on returning
on itself.

00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:42.445
We always witness these circles
and cycle of the seasons,

00:47:42.445 --> 00:47:45.510
and this is also what happens
with human life.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:51.056
There is nothing really unique
about us because we die and then

00:47:51.056 --> 00:47:55.349
we can wait for the
reincarnation of our soul.

00:47:55.349 --> 00:48:00.340
Death in Virgil is an elegiac
experience: it's never really

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:04.849
tragic and cannot be tragic,
because it lacks that edge of

00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:07.311
the uniqueness,
the edge that something

00:48:07.311 --> 00:48:11.097
particular and special has been
happening to the world because I

00:48:11.097 --> 00:48:13.050
am here,
certainly to my world,

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.909
because I am here,
and then I may disappear.

00:48:15.909 --> 00:48:21.697
Dante changes this idea of this
circularity, the elegiac quality

00:48:21.697 --> 00:48:25.650
of death and life that we have
in Virgil.

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:27.059
Why do I call it elegiac?
 

00:48:27.059 --> 00:48:30.331
Because you die and yet you can
come back, because we're really

00:48:30.331 --> 00:48:32.967
like leaves: and just as leaves
fall in the autumn,

00:48:32.967 --> 00:48:34.710
you just wait for the spring.
 

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:37.902
We might not be the same
leaves, but leaves very much

00:48:37.902 --> 00:48:40.789
like those that have just fallen
will return.

00:48:40.789 --> 00:48:42.150
Look what Dante does.
 

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:46.264
Dante goes on focusing on the
idea of uniqueness of every

00:48:46.264 --> 00:48:46.780
leaf.
 

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.668
"As in autumn,
the leaves drop off one after

00:48:49.668 --> 00:48:53.518
the other until the branch sees
all its spoils on the ground,

00:48:53.518 --> 00:48:58.219
so the wicked seed of
Adam," we--

00:48:58.219 --> 00:49:03.371
there is already some kind
of--some evil being acknowledged

00:49:03.371 --> 00:49:06.570
at the root of our own
existence,

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:08.239
"the wicked seed of
Adam,

00:49:08.239 --> 00:49:12.679
fling themselves from the shore
one by one at the signal,

00:49:12.679 --> 00:49:14.409
as a falcon at its recall.
 

00:49:14.409 --> 00:49:18.172
Thus, they depart over the dark
water and before they have

00:49:18.172 --> 00:49:21.869
landed on the other side,
a fresh crowd collects again on

00:49:21.869 --> 00:49:22.860
this."
 

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:27.980
For Dante, this image shows not
that leaves are--

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.512
our souls are like leaves,
but that a leaf can be

00:49:31.512 --> 00:49:36.148
described as a soul only if you
insist on its own uniqueness and

00:49:36.148 --> 00:49:39.018
the fact that it will never
return.

00:49:39.018 --> 00:49:42.364
There is one fairly
contemporary poet who understood

00:49:42.364 --> 00:49:45.840
this and I really want to quote
to you a few lines.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.869
I don't know that I remember
them all, it's Gerard Manley

00:49:48.869 --> 00:49:49.409
Hopkins.
 

00:49:49.409 --> 00:49:53.019
Some of you will have read--who
read English literature remember

00:49:53.019 --> 00:49:54.739
this, you may remember this.
 

00:49:54.739 --> 00:49:58.007
He writes his famous poem,
called Goldengrove

00:49:58.007 --> 00:49:59.050
Margaret.
 

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:00.880
Do you know the poem?
 

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.110
Do you know what I'm talking
about?

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:06.351
"Margaret,
are you grieving of a

00:50:06.351 --> 00:50:09.179
Goldengrove unleaving?
 

00:50:09.179 --> 00:50:13.329
Leaves like the things of man
you ...

00:50:13.329 --> 00:50:16.018
care for, can you?
 

00:50:16.018 --> 00:50:19.400
As the heart grows older it
will come to such sights

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.525
colder,"
etc.

00:50:20.525 --> 00:50:21.719
and continues.
 

00:50:21.719 --> 00:50:25.110
What is--Hopkins really is
reading this image.

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:26.500
What is he really saying?
 

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.018
He's saying he understands that
leaves,

00:50:29.018 --> 00:50:32.070
like the things of man you care
for,

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:37.659
can you--what comes back that's
not the life of human beings,

00:50:37.659 --> 00:50:41.369
but comes back are the things
that human beings may use and

00:50:41.369 --> 00:50:42.969
waste and those things.
 

00:50:42.969 --> 00:50:46.030
So the right analogy for Gerard
Manley Hopkins,

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:48.369
in a sense, really in the wake
of Dante,

00:50:48.369 --> 00:50:51.300
is between the things of man,
the things that we have,

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:56.599
the things that we can produce
and leaves, not souls.

00:50:56.599 --> 00:51:00.639
In formal terms,
this really means that Dante is

00:51:00.639 --> 00:51:05.795
replacing the notion of epic
circularity that you find in the

00:51:05.795 --> 00:51:08.570
classics,
the classics of Homer,

00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:11.500
the classics such as the
Aeneid,

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:15.559
with an idea of linear novel.
 

00:51:15.559 --> 00:51:19.369
The life of human beings is
best described formally by a

00:51:19.369 --> 00:51:23.454
novel in the sense that we are
caught in a journey that goes

00:51:23.454 --> 00:51:23.940
on.
 

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.500
It's unique and will reach its
destination whatever it will be.

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.349
We don't know yet,
at this point,

00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:30.159
of the poem.
 

00:51:30.159 --> 00:51:34.543
Now Dante enters into a circle,
into the garden,

00:51:34.543 --> 00:51:37.809
the first experience in Canto
IV.

00:51:37.809 --> 00:51:41.989
I will--I want to give you some
time to--I will have to deal

00:51:41.989 --> 00:51:44.610
with Canto IV and then I will
stop.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:47.260
I'll have to come straight to
the point about Canto IV.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:50.992
Dante comes to what is called
"limbo"

00:51:50.992 --> 00:51:54.817
the--
a word that comes from Latin,

00:51:54.817 --> 00:51:58.295
in Latin it--
that's what limbo is,

00:51:58.295 --> 00:52:00.929
this is the edge,
that's what it means,

00:52:00.929 --> 00:52:01.579
lembos.
 

00:52:01.579 --> 00:52:04.675
In Italian you speak of the
lembo,

00:52:04.675 --> 00:52:08.079
the edge of a dress or a jacket
and so on;

00:52:08.079 --> 00:52:12.530
comes to the area of Hell which
really is outside of Hell.

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:19.728
In fact, it's very much like
the Virgilian after-life of the

00:52:19.728 --> 00:52:21.070
virtuous.
 

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:23.610
And he meets a lot--it's
described as a garden,

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:25.820
one of the gardens,
one of the three,

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:29.329
four gardens we find a sort of
pre-figuration of the--

00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:32.670
in many ways of the earthly
paradise and gardens in

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:35.704
Purgatory,
but it's also pre-figuration of

00:52:35.704 --> 00:52:38.429
the world of Paradise where the
city,

00:52:38.429 --> 00:52:41.230
Jerusalem, is described as a
garden.

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:46.702
The first thing about this:
it's called the locus

00:52:46.702 --> 00:52:53.570
amoenus in case you want to
know what the technical term,

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:58.829
locus amoenus,
the kind of idyllic place,

00:52:58.829 --> 00:53:03.681
and this is a term,
a phraseology that belongs to

00:53:03.681 --> 00:53:06.409
very much the epic world.
 

00:53:06.409 --> 00:53:08.210
And in the world,
for instance,

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:10.670
later in the Renaissance
whether it's--

00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:15.309
it could be Spencer or Tasso,
or Milton,

00:53:15.309 --> 00:53:19.094
there is always the story of
the hero who reaches this

00:53:19.094 --> 00:53:21.880
idyllic bucolic place and-- to
relax.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:26.824
It's really a place of the
breakdown of the errancy of the

00:53:26.824 --> 00:53:29.871
hero,
of the adventurous spirit,

00:53:29.871 --> 00:53:33.233
and always shows,
or maybe it's just the irony in

00:53:33.233 --> 00:53:36.788
literary structures,
that whenever heroes seem to

00:53:36.788 --> 00:53:41.480
look for a pause to the quest by
reaching the garden and

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.132
relaxing,
that's where they find out they

00:53:45.132 --> 00:53:48.170
are in the most dangerous
situation.

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:52.664
That whenever you think that
you are safe and you can disarm,

00:53:52.664 --> 00:53:56.409
and there's the running cool
water of the river.

00:53:56.409 --> 00:53:58.891
There is the shade;
there is the fragrance of the

00:53:58.891 --> 00:54:01.780
landscape,
this is the way that we're--the

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.806
wherewithal,
the description of these

00:54:04.806 --> 00:54:08.168
bucolic gardens,
that's exactly when the snake

00:54:08.168 --> 00:54:09.010
will appear.
 

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:13.606
That's exactly when the enemy
will be capable of reaching you

00:54:13.606 --> 00:54:15.139
and overwhelm you.
 

00:54:15.139 --> 00:54:18.076
This is also--in other words
there are all these places of

00:54:18.076 --> 00:54:20.239
temptation and that's what
happens here.

00:54:20.239 --> 00:54:24.960
Dante here, arrives and he sees
the poets,

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:28.594
Canto IV, it's an
extraordinary--they're all

00:54:28.594 --> 00:54:32.260
virtuous heathens,
he sees the poets,

00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:36.360
and the great poets that he
will see--

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.768
the first poets that he will
see are--

00:54:37.768 --> 00:54:40.940
first of all he sees all the
figures from--

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:45.409
he will enumerate the
characters, scientists,

00:54:45.409 --> 00:54:48.420
philosophers from the Greek and
Roman world,

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:49.869
but put a little bit at the
edge.

00:54:49.869 --> 00:54:53.867
They really don't seem to have
much impact on the situation

00:54:53.867 --> 00:54:54.349
here.
 

00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:57.090
But then the dramatic situation
is when here,

00:54:57.090 --> 00:55:01.699
lines 80 and following,
"O you,"

00:55:01.699 --> 00:55:06.653
he sees the poets,
the classical poets from Homer

00:55:06.653 --> 00:55:10.702
to Horace and Ovid,
"O you who honored both

00:55:10.702 --> 00:55:13.597
science and art,
who are these to have such

00:55:13.597 --> 00:55:17.130
honor that it sets them apart
from the condition of the rest?'

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:19.782
And he said to me,"
Virgil speaking,

00:55:19.782 --> 00:55:23.230
"their honorable fame
which resounds in thy life

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.750
above, gains favor in Heaven,
etc.

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:30.034
'Honor the lofty poet,
his shade returns that left

00:55:30.034 --> 00:55:30.559
us.'
 

00:55:30.559 --> 00:55:33.268
When the voice has paused and
there was silence...

00:55:33.268 --> 00:55:35.849
I saw four great shades coming
to us;

00:55:35.849 --> 00:55:38.829
their looks were neither sad
nor joyful."

00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:40.860
As befits limbo.
 

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.510
It's clearly like life here.
 

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:47.309
That's what the after-life is
in Dante's conception.

00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:52.670
It's only an extension of what
we choose to do on this earth.

00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:56.539
If you really think that life,
the beauty of life,

00:55:56.539 --> 00:56:00.389
which is not a bad idea,
is talking about having endless

00:56:00.389 --> 00:56:02.909
seminars of aesthetics or
poetry,

00:56:02.909 --> 00:56:05.460
as these poets do,
that's what your after-life is.

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:08.371
You sit down,
sit on the grass and go on

00:56:08.371 --> 00:56:11.510
talking about beautiful things,
he says.

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:16.976
"The good master began:
'Mark him there with sword in

00:56:16.976 --> 00:56:21.579
hand who comes before the three
as their lord.

00:56:21.579 --> 00:56:25.250
He is Homer, the sovereign poet.
 

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:28.570
He that comes next is Horace,
the moralist.

00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:31.289
Ovid is the third,
and the last,

00:56:31.289 --> 00:56:34.713
Lucan,"
famous epic poet whom Dante

00:56:34.713 --> 00:56:38.750
will again celebrate in
Purgatory,

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:42.157
"Since each shares with me
in the name the one voice

00:56:42.157 --> 00:56:45.929
uttered they give me honorable
welcome and in this do well.'

00:56:45.929 --> 00:56:49.414
Thus I will assemble the noble
school,"

00:56:49.414 --> 00:56:52.829
school in Greek means--
it's also leisure,

00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:57.675
the leisurely life,
scholar, the world of play and

00:56:57.675 --> 00:57:01.586
the world of leisure,
" the lord of loftiest

00:57:01.586 --> 00:57:03.768
song who flies like an
eagle," Homer,

00:57:03.768 --> 00:57:05.420
" above the rest."
 

00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:08.420
And the irony,
of course, is that he's blind

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:12.188
and the eagle to have the sharp
view, the sharp vision,

00:57:12.188 --> 00:57:15.469
but that Homer's vision is an
inner vision.

00:57:15.469 --> 00:57:19.293
He looks--he's blind because
he's looking inward in order to

00:57:19.293 --> 00:57:22.469
know what the song he is to sing
will be about.

00:57:22.469 --> 00:57:24.744
"After they had talked
together for a time,

00:57:24.744 --> 00:57:27.699
they turned to me with a sign
of greeting and my master smiled

00:57:27.699 --> 00:57:29.927
at this;
and then they showed me still

00:57:29.927 --> 00:57:32.369
greater honor,
for they made me one of their

00:57:32.369 --> 00:57:36.119
number, so that I was the sixth
among those high intelligences.

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:39.851
Thus, we went on as far as the
light, talking of things which

00:57:39.851 --> 00:57:43.581
were fitting for that place and
of which it is well now to be

00:57:43.581 --> 00:57:44.639
silent."
 

00:57:44.639 --> 00:57:47.110
Here is Dante.
 

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:52.659
He inscribes himself in the
history of Western poetry;

00:57:52.659 --> 00:57:55.583
from Homer to Dante,
he counts himself as sixth

00:57:55.583 --> 00:57:56.409
among them.
 

00:57:56.409 --> 00:57:58.429
Here's Virgil,
here's Lucan,

00:57:58.429 --> 00:58:00.373
here's Ovid,
here's Horace,

00:58:00.373 --> 00:58:02.842
and of course,
the master of them,

00:58:02.842 --> 00:58:04.039
all Homer.
 

00:58:04.039 --> 00:58:07.380
We go from Homer to Dante,
it's a little history,

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.092
if you wish,
of Western poetry and Dante

00:58:10.092 --> 00:58:12.389
thinks that he belongs to it.
 

00:58:12.389 --> 00:58:14.840
We could say a number of things
about what they are talking

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:15.179
about.
 

00:58:15.179 --> 00:58:16.320
He says he doesn't say.
 

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:20.161
We talk about beautiful things
which we--I infer we can easily

00:58:20.161 --> 00:58:23.940
infer they talk about poetry:
they talk about their craft.

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:28.360
There may be a little link that
I would like you to reflect on,

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.840
on your own,
between the garden and the kind

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:33.253
of poetry,
the kind of beauty that they

00:58:33.253 --> 00:58:34.800
are really talking about.
 

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.489
This is the way Dante's
imagination works.

00:58:37.489 --> 00:58:40.425
You have to pull together
things that don't seem to be

00:58:40.425 --> 00:58:41.090
described.
 

00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:43.503
So this is the garden,
there's some kind of

00:58:43.503 --> 00:58:45.170
self-absorption about this.
 

00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:49.208
There seems to be a kind of
self-enclosure about this kind

00:58:49.208 --> 00:58:50.059
of poetry.
 

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:53.237
It's a little scene that
reflects on what the spiritual

00:58:53.237 --> 00:58:56.998
condition may have been like,
but what is the most surprising

00:58:56.998 --> 00:59:00.150
and what constitutes the
temptation of this canto,

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:04.871
the temptation of the scene for
the pilgrim's own spiritual

00:59:04.871 --> 00:59:07.619
pilgrimage;
he's involved in the spiritual

00:59:07.619 --> 00:59:09.929
descent which turns out to be an
ascent.

00:59:09.929 --> 00:59:13.152
He says at one point "I
was sixth among such

00:59:13.152 --> 00:59:14.159
genius."
 

00:59:14.159 --> 00:59:16.949
Do you see the discrepancy?
 

00:59:16.949 --> 00:59:18.949
Do you see how this is jarring?
 

00:59:18.949 --> 00:59:19.960
Can you hear it?
 

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.349
He is going down for redemption.
 

00:59:22.349 --> 00:59:27.081
He is descending in humility,
and yet now he talks as a poet,

00:59:27.081 --> 00:59:30.789
his poetic voice is one that
elevates itself.

00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:35.440
There seems to be a kind of
discrepancy between the two,

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:38.739
that's the great temptation of
Dante.

00:59:38.739 --> 00:59:43.233
To believe that as a poet he
has been claiming that poetry is

00:59:43.233 --> 00:59:47.389
better than philosophy,
that poetry is like history,

00:59:47.389 --> 00:59:52.206
and the first concern Dante has
is to reflect on the wholeness

00:59:52.206 --> 00:59:53.550
of this claim.
 

00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:57.547
How this kind of claim about
the importance of poetry can

00:59:57.547 --> 01:00:00.260
turn out to be a temptation for
him.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:04.842
It's a hubris and I focus on
it, as I have focused on it,

01:00:04.842 --> 01:00:09.590
because in effect what we're
going to discuss next time.

01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:12.659
Canto V, it is an extended
reflection,

01:00:12.659 --> 01:00:15.380
a way for Dante to reflect on
this claim,

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:21.056
an extended reflection on the
dangers of such a claim and the

01:00:21.056 --> 01:00:24.369
responsibility of writing
poetry.

01:00:24.369 --> 01:00:28.887
Dante will meet the great
heroine of all love stories,

01:00:28.887 --> 01:00:29.909
Francesca.
 

01:00:29.909 --> 01:00:32.300
Everybody knows about this
fantastic figure,

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:36.039
a lovely figure Francesca who
dies for love,

01:00:36.039 --> 01:00:40.980
but Dante's actually
encountering a reader of his own

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:46.869
poetry and he witnesses the kind
of traps and risk that reading

01:00:46.869 --> 01:00:48.010
implies.
 

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:51.940
We are going to go on next time
thinking about this whole

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.730
question of reading and
responsibilities of writing.

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:58.364
Canto IV, by the way,
I cannot leave without saying

01:00:58.364 --> 01:01:01.739
something about the epic quality
because I have been just talking

01:01:01.739 --> 01:01:04.255
about--
I have been defining the poem

01:01:04.255 --> 01:01:07.523
really as a novelistic
vis-à-vis the

01:01:07.523 --> 01:01:12.271
circular structure of an--
of Virgil's understanding of

01:01:12.271 --> 01:01:15.068
the reincarnation,
and therefore,

01:01:15.068 --> 01:01:18.280
the great notion of what an
epic is and now I will say--

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.210
actually Dante goes on mixing
his genres.

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:24.108
As soon as you formulate
something, Dante has a way of

01:01:24.108 --> 01:01:25.860
undercutting that formulation.
 

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:30.927
Canto IV ends with a miniature
representation of the epic

01:01:30.927 --> 01:01:33.010
quality of this text.
 

01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:37.289
It goes on enumerating all the
souls that he can see,

01:01:37.289 --> 01:01:40.994
which is really as you know,
if you remember from your

01:01:40.994 --> 01:01:43.650
Iliad on the Gates of
Ilion,

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:47.967
at one point Helen will go on
numbering all the ships of the

01:01:47.967 --> 01:01:49.869
Greeks to the old Priam.
 

01:01:49.869 --> 01:01:51.010
You remember that scene?
 

01:01:51.010 --> 01:01:54.409
Some of you may remember that,
and this is the way Canto IV

01:01:54.409 --> 01:01:56.579
ends with lines 124 and
following:

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:59.708
"There before me on the
enamelled green were shown to me

01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:03.099
the great spirits by the sight
of whom I am uplifted in myself.

01:02:03.099 --> 01:02:05.467
I saw Electra with many in her
company, of whom I knew Hector

01:02:05.467 --> 01:02:06.376
and Aeneas and Caesar..
 

01:02:06.376 --> 01:02:08.152
.I saw Camilla,
Penthesilea on the other side,

01:02:08.152 --> 01:02:10.719
and I saw the Latian king who
sat with his daughter Lavinia;

01:02:10.719 --> 01:02:14.148
I saw Brutus who drove out
Tarquin, Lucrece,

01:02:14.148 --> 01:02:16.539
Julia, Marcia,
and Cornelia;

01:02:16.539 --> 01:02:17.340
and by himself ...
 

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:20.889
I saw Saladin,"
a great sign of honor,

01:02:20.889 --> 01:02:26.489
Saladin who sits by himself as
a kind of lofty state and,

01:02:26.489 --> 01:02:29.436
" when I raised my eyes a
little higher I saw the master

01:02:29.436 --> 01:02:32.139
of them that now sitting amid a
philosophic family...

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:32.847
Socrates...
 

01:02:32.847 --> 01:02:35.425
Plato,"
the other one was Aristotle,

01:02:35.425 --> 01:02:37.615
"Democritus,
Diogenes..."

01:02:37.615 --> 01:02:40.385
all the Greek philosophers and
then Orpheus,

01:02:40.385 --> 01:02:42.253
Cicero, Linus,
Seneca, Euclid,

01:02:42.253 --> 01:02:43.349
Ptolemy.
 

01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:47.474
A version of the classical
encyclopedia:

01:02:47.474 --> 01:02:51.809
all of the knowledge is
gathered here,

01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:55.485
and yet Dante has a way of
saying that traditional

01:02:55.485 --> 01:02:58.384
encyclopedias,
these formal structures as he

01:02:58.384 --> 01:03:00.849
wanted to organize the world of
knowledge,

01:03:00.849 --> 01:03:02.929
there is something wanting
about them.

01:03:02.929 --> 01:03:03.949
Why?
 

01:03:03.949 --> 01:03:04.739
What's wanting about them?
 

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:08.570
They never tell you how you can
really educate yourself.

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:11.730
They never describe the process
of education.

01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:15.677
To know that to describe the
process of education you go to

01:03:15.677 --> 01:03:19.831
have an encyclopedic poem where
you are showing the phases and

01:03:19.831 --> 01:03:23.436
the stages of learning;
as the pilgrim will it was the

01:03:23.436 --> 01:03:25.909
second thing that I have to say
is that,

01:03:25.909 --> 01:03:29.210
in any enumeration as you have
here,

01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:32.320
an epic enumeration,
and I will close my remarks for

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:32.929
the day.
 

01:03:32.929 --> 01:03:40.559
Enumerations always imply the
wish of a narrative such as an

01:03:40.559 --> 01:03:44.730
encyclopedia,
because it's as little bit of

01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:48.965
an encyclopedic form I say,
to encompass the whole of

01:03:48.965 --> 01:03:52.980
reality: that's what
encyclopedias want to do.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:56.344
The reality of it,
the intellectual reality,

01:03:56.344 --> 01:04:01.039
and yet enumerations by their
virtual being enumerations will

01:04:01.039 --> 01:04:04.639
tell you that no totalization is
possible.

01:04:04.639 --> 01:04:10.244
There is something that always
escapes the formal ordering that

01:04:10.244 --> 01:04:13.320
the encyclopedias want to reach.
 

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.907
And for now I stop with my
remarks and we have a few

01:04:16.907 --> 01:04:21.059
minutes in case there are
questions, as I hope there are.

01:04:21.059 --> 01:04:23.929
I welcome questions.
 

01:04:23.929 --> 01:04:28.170
I will repeat your questions,
by the way, for the benefit of

01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:29.320
the videotape.
 

01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:37.340
Please.
 

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:40.516
Student:  So when Dante
talks about the first group of

01:04:40.516 --> 01:04:43.590
sinners who work for themselves
who didn't take a side,

01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:45.989
so you think that was also
political commentary?

01:04:45.989 --> 01:04:47.829
Prof: Yes.
 

01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:50.646
The question is,
Dante talks about the neutral

01:04:50.646 --> 01:04:51.210
angels.
 

01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:53.331
He calls them "for
themselves"

01:04:53.331 --> 01:04:55.507
and we say it's "by
themselves"

01:04:55.507 --> 01:04:57.518
and the question then really
is,

01:04:57.518 --> 01:04:59.809
is that also a political
commentary?

01:04:59.809 --> 01:05:02.713
Before I could rephrase,
I could repeat this--the

01:05:02.713 --> 01:05:04.829
question--I said yes,
absolutely.

01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:10.867
Dante will use the very same
experience for himself later in

01:05:10.867 --> 01:05:17.518
Paradise where he will say that
in many ways being by oneself,

01:05:17.518 --> 01:05:21.847
there are times when that can
become an act of virtue where

01:05:21.847 --> 01:05:25.730
the notion of neutrality is
going to be redefined.

01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:28.909
Dante doesn't like clearly
neutrality, all right.

01:05:28.909 --> 01:05:32.360
Why is he--does he find
neutrality?

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.590
Because it's a language of
privation for him,

01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:39.757
it's really way of--it's the
decision not to take decisions

01:05:39.757 --> 01:05:44.286
because you are always making a
decision even when we think that

01:05:44.286 --> 01:05:47.829
we are not making a decision,
so you really are.

01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:52.090
To him that is the sign of a
great cowardice.

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:56.010
He explains that in cosmic
terms.

01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:59.800
This is the metaphysics the
great war in Heaven,

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.648
which by the way,
enables me now to say that it

01:06:02.648 --> 01:06:06.487
gives the whole of Hell a kind
of symmetrical structure because

01:06:06.487 --> 01:06:10.079
it clearly begins with the
neutral angels and ends with the

01:06:10.079 --> 01:06:12.679
encounter-- with Lucifer at the
end.

01:06:12.679 --> 01:06:16.554
So you that this is really the
kind--what frames the narrative

01:06:16.554 --> 01:06:17.190
of Hell.
 

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:20.375
To go back to your question,
when Dante is going to talk

01:06:20.375 --> 01:06:22.228
about politics,
he also believed,

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:24.719
for a while,
that he had to take sides.

01:06:24.719 --> 01:06:29.333
He did, and he did by going
back now to the few remarks

01:06:29.333 --> 01:06:33.179
about his language,
his political involvement,

01:06:33.179 --> 01:06:36.768
on the first class,
the first seminar.

01:06:36.768 --> 01:06:40.661
He was banned,
he was sentenced to exile,

01:06:40.661 --> 01:06:46.210
and then he removed himself
from all partisan politics.

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:50.340
How did he do this and why did
he do this?

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:54.251
For a while he was a Guelf
being thrown out of Florence

01:06:54.251 --> 01:06:58.552
with many others,
also as an act of punishment

01:06:58.552 --> 01:07:04.460
for a decision he had made to
throw out the Ghibellines,

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.523
among whom his own best friend,
Guido Cavalcanti,

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:08.800
who died in exile.
 

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.980
He's thrown out,
and we do know these historical

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:12.860
happenings.
 

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:18.262
They spend the first few years
of their exile plotting and

01:07:18.262 --> 01:07:20.483
making,
and going on through

01:07:20.483 --> 01:07:24.369
machinations as to how to get
back to Florence and damn it,

01:07:24.369 --> 01:07:26.050
really make them pay.
 

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:30.360
He realizes very quickly the
wickedness of this plan.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:34.463
He realizes that his own party
is no better than that of the

01:07:34.463 --> 01:07:38.010
Ghibellines and so he removes
himself from them,

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:43.385
the act of removal from the
criminal violence that he and

01:07:43.385 --> 01:07:48.860
his other accomplices were for a
while thinking about,

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:53.606
turns out to be madness and so
he decides in this act of

01:07:53.606 --> 01:07:57.518
virtue,
absolute solitude and that is

01:07:57.518 --> 01:07:58.780
by himself.
 

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:02.163
There is a kind of judgment,
but let me refine that,

01:08:02.163 --> 01:08:05.480
how can you go on really
describing that the act of

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.940
neutrality is bad.
 

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:11.382
And yet there is a way in which
there are times where neutrality

01:08:11.382 --> 01:08:15.474
can become nothing less than a
virtuous decision as he will

01:08:15.474 --> 01:08:16.109
make.
 

01:08:16.109 --> 01:08:18.859
Other questions?
 

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:23.060
Please.
 

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.474
Student:  I have a
question from last Tuesday's

01:08:25.474 --> 01:08:25.930
lecture.
 

01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:28.198
Prof: Last--yes please.
 

01:08:28.198 --> 01:08:29.836
Student:  Last
Tuesday--you talked about

01:08:29.836 --> 01:08:30.832
friendship and love,
love and

01:08:30.832 --> 01:08:31.899
&gt;.
 

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:35.890
There was no conversation about
lust,

01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:38.100
and we know from this history
that both of them,

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:45.654
Beatrice and Dante were married
and that he had children and I'm

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:52.729
wondering if the physical aspect
above is irrelevant for the

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:53.810
poet.
 

01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:59.444
Prof: The question
refers to the remark I made

01:08:59.444 --> 01:09:02.132
about--
that was picked up by a student

01:09:02.132 --> 01:09:03.680
also,
another student,

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.309
the remark about love and
friendship as the two are

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:10.140
dramatized in the Vita
nuova.

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:14.358
It refers--wants to know,
wants me to explore more the

01:09:14.358 --> 01:09:17.621
role of lust,
since we know that Dante was

01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:21.760
married and what does lust have
to do with love.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.908
I take, that's really the
question.

01:09:24.908 --> 01:09:28.849
Let me just say that it's a
very complicated question and I

01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:33.060
will talk about this next time
when we deal with Francesca,

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:37.600
who is of course,
the heroine of lust,

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.170
if there was ever one.
 

01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:42.270
Then we'll see what Dante means
by that.

01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:46.184
I mean the--it clearly is an
issue related to love,

01:09:46.184 --> 01:09:48.689
fundamentally related to love.
 

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:52.055
But to believe and I'm
really--probably have confused

01:09:52.055 --> 01:09:54.992
some of you here,
but don't be confused,

01:09:54.992 --> 01:09:59.096
to believe that Dante's
judgment of Francesca is limited

01:09:59.096 --> 01:10:01.859
to the representation of Canto
V,

01:10:01.859 --> 01:10:04.703
where he describes the
relationship between lust and

01:10:04.703 --> 01:10:06.634
love,
lust and love,

01:10:06.634 --> 01:10:09.390
would be a grand mistake.
 

01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:15.552
Dante understands that without
physicality there could be no

01:10:15.552 --> 01:10:22.029
love, that there's no soul which
is not connected to a body.

01:10:22.029 --> 01:10:25.786
In fact, some of the remarks
that I made today are really

01:10:25.786 --> 01:10:28.270
about--
can be construed--I did not

01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:32.239
make the point but it can be
construed as his sense of the

01:10:32.239 --> 01:10:36.372
inevitability of the body,
that the intellect in and by

01:10:36.372 --> 01:10:38.667
itself,
the soul in of and by itself,

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:41.680
without materiality,
without some degree of being

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.059
wedded to the body,
is really not part of the human

01:10:46.059 --> 01:10:47.238
experience.
 

01:10:47.238 --> 01:10:50.368
This is what I was saying today
about the fact that the journey

01:10:50.368 --> 01:10:52.539
is not only just an intellectual
journey.

01:10:52.539 --> 01:10:56.496
It has to be done in the body;
it's part of the sense of the

01:10:56.496 --> 01:10:58.979
inevitability of the body.
 

01:10:58.979 --> 01:11:03.011
After all, this is really what
his Christianity is about:

01:11:03.011 --> 01:11:05.100
it's about the incarnation.
 

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:09.479
It's about the being embodied,
about the divinity being

01:11:09.479 --> 01:11:13.859
embodied and therefore entering
our human condition.

01:11:13.859 --> 01:11:17.408
Let me also say that Dante goes
on thinking about Francesca.

01:11:17.408 --> 01:11:22.337
He condemns her and Francesca
is always circling around in

01:11:22.337 --> 01:11:26.229
this state of permanent desire
with power,

01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:28.461
in other words by moving
around, they're really

01:11:28.461 --> 01:11:30.109
describing their unquiet hearts.
 

01:11:30.109 --> 01:11:35.078
If you are--when you are at
peace you just stop and sit.

01:11:35.078 --> 01:11:37.020
She just goes on moving around
and around;

01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:41.710
that's their punishment and
yet, he remembers her.

01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:45.247
When Dante reaches the Heaven
and metaphysics in Paradise and

01:11:45.247 --> 01:11:47.899
he has to talk about the kiss of
creation,

01:11:47.899 --> 01:11:52.712
how creation--God creates the
world by imprinting a kiss on

01:11:52.712 --> 01:11:56.279
the material that he had at his
disposal.

01:11:56.279 --> 01:12:01.050
The language that he will use
is going to be the language of

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:05.902
Francesca and that to me means
that the kiss of Francesca can

01:12:05.902 --> 01:12:10.430
also be construed as the
existential encounter to God's--

01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:13.260
;the--God's kiss on creation.
 

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:15.439
It's a way--I don't think that
he's redeeming her,

01:12:15.439 --> 01:12:18.481
there's no such thing as the
redemption for the infernal

01:12:18.481 --> 01:12:20.729
souls,
and yet there is an idea--there

01:12:20.729 --> 01:12:22.988
is something that may have gone
wrong,

01:12:22.988 --> 01:12:25.210
and we'll have to see what it
is, and it's not the lust.

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:26.960
We have to see what the
situation is;

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:27.939
it's not lust.
 

01:12:27.939 --> 01:12:33.595
I don't think it's only lust
and that is part of--there's

01:12:33.595 --> 01:12:37.029
something even larger about her.
 

01:12:37.029 --> 01:12:40.889
What--the mistake that she
seems to be making is of a

01:12:40.889 --> 01:12:45.193
different sort and I'll keep you
hanging until next time so

01:12:45.193 --> 01:12:47.939
that--otherwise what's the
point?

01:12:47.939 --> 01:12:51.408
We have to look at Canto V.
 

01:12:51.408 --> 01:12:54.846
Let's read Canto V for next
Tuesday, but before you go,

01:12:54.846 --> 01:12:58.603
there's some time so in case
there are-- we have a couple of

01:12:58.603 --> 01:13:00.449
minutes, other questions?
 

01:13:00.449 --> 01:13:02.738
Please.
 

01:13:02.738 --> 01:13:05.507
Student:  In Canto I,
when he is talking to Virgil

01:13:05.507 --> 01:13:07.488
and he says,
"you're the only one from

01:13:07.488 --> 01:13:09.801
whom my writing drew the noble
stuff of which I have been

01:13:09.801 --> 01:13:11.288
&lt;&lt;inaudibl
e&gt;&gt;."

01:13:11.288 --> 01:13:13.189
It's really kind of a lie isn't
it?

01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:16.417
Prof: It--he says--
Student:  So he's saying

01:13:16.417 --> 01:13:18.247
that he's--
that he's taken his style from

01:13:18.247 --> 01:13:20.359
him and that's the style for
which he's been--

01:13:20.359 --> 01:13:23.679
for which he's gained honor,
but he's not honored as an epic

01:13:23.679 --> 01:13:25.569
poet,
he's not--that's not--what are

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:28.403
the implications of what he's
saying because it's really not

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:29.220
actually true.
 

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:32.090
Prof: Okay,
the question is,

01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:36.985
a reference to the encounter
between the pilgrim and Virgil

01:13:36.985 --> 01:13:40.868
in Canto I of Inferno
where Dante--

01:13:40.868 --> 01:13:43.970
in what I called the
captatio benevolentia,

01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:46.500
what are captured in the
benevolence of Virgil,

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.201
the only living-- he doesn't
even know if it's a shade or a

01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:50.855
human being,
turns out that he is a human

01:13:50.855 --> 01:13:53.237
being,
he says, well you are the poet

01:13:53.237 --> 01:13:56.470
from whom I took the style that
has honored--

01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:58.380
has made me honor.
 

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:02.932
The sort of--the real question
is, this is a little bit of a

01:14:02.932 --> 01:14:06.173
lie isn't it,
because Dante by this time is

01:14:06.173 --> 01:14:09.029
not really known as an epic
poet.

01:14:09.029 --> 01:14:13.353
I would really say--call it a
lie, say it's part of the

01:14:13.353 --> 01:14:17.516
simulation, rhetorical
simulation of--captured in the

01:14:17.516 --> 01:14:20.078
benevolence of the listener.
 

01:14:20.078 --> 01:14:24.761
At the same time it's really an
acknowledgement of Virgil's

01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:27.988
mastery, and what is Virgil's
mastery?

01:14:27.988 --> 01:14:32.920
Dante really thought that his
own poetry is--

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.636
that Latin is not a dead
language, that the vernacular is

01:14:37.636 --> 01:14:41.260
really the way Latin has become
in time,

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:44.720
so the continuity between
Virgil and him is real,

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.658
so there's a kind of continuity
of poetic continuity.

01:14:49.658 --> 01:14:52.429
You're quite right that it's
literally--literally it's not

01:14:52.429 --> 01:14:52.770
true.
 

01:14:52.770 --> 01:14:55.011
At that point,
Dante's more of a provincial

01:14:55.011 --> 01:14:57.948
poet or the poet who follows the
stilnovisti,

01:14:57.948 --> 01:15:01.596
the poets of the Sweet New
Style from Bologna and Florence

01:15:01.596 --> 01:15:02.750
and then Virgil.
 

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:06.399
Thank you so much;
we'll see you next time.

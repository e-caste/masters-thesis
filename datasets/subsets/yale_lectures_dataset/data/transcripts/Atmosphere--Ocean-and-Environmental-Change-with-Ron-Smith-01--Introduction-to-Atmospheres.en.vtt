00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.833
RONALD SMITH: I'm Professor 
Ron Smith from the

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:05.567
Department of Geology
and Geophysics.

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.733
And if you're in the right
place, you know that this is

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.233
the course called the
Atmosphere, the Ocean, and

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:13.467
Environmental Change.

00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:14.933
There's a lot to talk
about today.

00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.533
If some of you are shopping, I
want to be sure you get enough

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:21.733
information about the course
to make your decision about

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.167
whether to take it or not.

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:25.200
And for those that are
definitely in, I want to get

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.567
you started toward some of the
course material that we have

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:31.167
in this course as well.

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:35.200
So as I will usually do in the
mornings, I'll have some notes

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.333
in the upper left there.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.200
And I want to run through
some of those.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.233
This is just informational
stuff, logistical information

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:44.467
about the course.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.700
There's some confusion
about this.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.800
The lab is required.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.633
So everybody that takes this
course takes the lab.

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:55.433
And everybody that takes the
lab takes this course.

00:00:55.433 --> 00:01:01.333
You get graded separately for
the two, but the subject

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.600
material is merged and
coordinated in a certain way.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.233
So you have to take
both of those.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:09.333
That means when you're signing
up for the course, be sure to

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.800
sign up for the lab as well.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.000
It has a different
course number.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.933
For example, EVST 201 is this
course, 202 is the lab.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.700
Or if you signed up under
Geology, it's 140,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.067
and 141 is the lab.

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:32.333
Also, the Classes server,
they're separate sites.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.700
So be sure to register on both
of those because I'll be

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.600
posting information about the
lab on the lab course number.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.833
Now the labs aren't
going to start

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:44.167
actually until week three.

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:48.067
So we're not going to do lab
section sign ups yet.

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:51.833
But I will tell you that
the labs are on

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:53.600
Monday and Tuesday afternoon.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.367
There's four sections
altogether.

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:58.067
And you've got to be
able to fit into at

00:01:58.067 --> 00:01:59.800
least one of those.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.600
And we hope more than one
because we're going to have to

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.200
even you out.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.500
But those labs are at 1:30
and then at 3:30 on

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.500
both of those days.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.933
So we'll be doing those lab sign
ups next week when you

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:16.033
have a better idea of what
your schedule is like.

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:19.867
But try to keep those Monday and
Tuesday afternoons open,

00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:21.367
so you can fit into
one of the labs.

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:23.067
Because if you can't
take the lab, you

00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:25.500
can't take the course.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.933
Let's see, there's already a
problem set posted on the

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:30.433
Classes server.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:34.333
And it is due next Friday,
a week from Friday.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:37.933
And you may ask, how could I
have already posted a problem

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:39.833
set when I haven't
given a single

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:41.300
lecture about the course?

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.733
Well, that's because this
particular problem set is kind

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:47.333
of a warm up.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:51.300
It's got questions on there
that you could do with an

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.667
elementary knowledge of
high school physics.

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:59.467
And I'd like to get you
started on that.

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:02.933
Both because we need you to be
fresh and familiar with those

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:06.900
subjects, but also those of
you that don't have a good

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.833
background might want to use
that as a guide as to whether

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:13.567
this is the right
course for you.

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:16.467
So take a look at that problem
set as soon as you can.

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:19.633
And if you have any problems
with it, talk to me,

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.933
talk to your TAs.

00:03:21.933 --> 00:03:26.500
Speaking of TAs, let me see if
I can introduce them to you.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.567
Ravi is there.

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:30.233
Jennifer is there.

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:31.533
Is Meng here?

00:03:31.533 --> 00:03:33.167
Meng is right there
beside them.

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:35.967
And Srikanth.

00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:36.833
No Srikanth today.

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:38.600
OK.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.933
And by the way, Melanie here on
the left, on my right, is

00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:46.067
going to be helping with
the taping transcript.

00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:48.667
So we're going to have
this course taped.

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:52.000
And I'm afraid these tapes--
they're not going to be

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.400
available to you during
the semester.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.667
There's too much of a lag
time, I think, to

00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:57.667
get those to you.

00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:00.867
But I don't think it'll
be a problem in class.

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:03.333
One thing I want to mention
though, this course--

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:05.600
well, it seems like we got
a pretty big class here.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.500
But still, even with this class,
it's a very convenient

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.700
room and a very convenient
class to have a lot of

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.933
discussion, questions,
answers.

00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:16.833
So be prepared for that.

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:20.667
Don't be shy about
asking questions.

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:23.233
And I think that will really add
a lot to the course if you

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:24.233
get in the habit.

00:04:24.233 --> 00:04:27.567
If you've gone for a period
or two and haven't asked a

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:31.000
question in class, you should
ask yourself why?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.567
Because it's probably not the
clarity of my lectures.

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:38.167
It's probably that you're just
reluctant to put your hand up.

00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:41.967
So try to gauge this
a little bit.

00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:44.100
And if you're asking too many
questions, which hasn't

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.700
happened yet, but if
it happens, I'll

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.433
tell you about that.

00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:50.733
And we can scale it back.

00:04:50.733 --> 00:04:51.933
The textbook--

00:04:51.933 --> 00:04:55.233
I went down the bookstore
yesterday, and I saw it there.

00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:59.100
It didn't look like they
had that many copies.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.400
But I should mention that if
you get a copy that's an

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.967
edition or two old,
that would be OK.

00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:10.700
And you might be able to really
save some money by

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.967
doing that.

00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:14.200
But get that book right away
because you're going to need

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.067
that starting immediately.

00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:18.533
And if you have to order it
online, and it's going to take

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:20.333
a couple weeks, that's
probably not good.

00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:22.233
So get that coming to you.

00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:25.700
But anyway, the book is this
one, Essentials of

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.467
Meteorology.

00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:30.833
And a word or two about it.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.300
It's a descriptive
book primarily.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.867
It describes things
that go on in the

00:05:37.867 --> 00:05:39.833
atmosphere in the ocean.

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:42.667
And that'll be really great.

00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:44.600
That'll supplement what
I do in lectures.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.733
The course, however, is more
quantitative than this.

00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:52.867
And the quantitative material
will come from my lectures.

00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:55.567
And you'll be working on the
quantitative side of the

00:05:55.567 --> 00:05:59.200
course every week with
these problem sets.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.233
So try to understand that,
you're going to be reading

00:06:03.233 --> 00:06:05.333
this to get the descriptive
material.

00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:08.900
And you're going to be working
off my notes and the problem

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.700
sets to do the quantitative
material.

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:18.567
I wanted to mention that final
exam date because these exam

00:06:18.567 --> 00:06:21.300
dates cycle through.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.867
Yale tries to be fair in how
they assign exam dates to

00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:25.733
different courses.

00:06:25.733 --> 00:06:29.267
And last year, our final
exam was on the

00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:31.633
first day of exam period.

00:06:31.633 --> 00:06:33.533
Well, we cycled off.

00:06:33.533 --> 00:06:39.367
And now we're on the last day
of exam period, December 17.

00:06:39.367 --> 00:06:42.067
So if you're booking flights
home, please

00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:42.967
keep that in mind.

00:06:42.967 --> 00:06:45.000
You have to be here on--

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.267
I forget what day of
the week that is.

00:06:46.267 --> 00:06:52.867
But that's the last day of exam
period for this course.

00:06:52.867 --> 00:06:54.100
Any questions so far?

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:04.100
So what's this course
all about?

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.633
I would say a lot of the course
simply has to do with

00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:11.833
how the atmosphere and
the ocean work.

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:17.600
How does the air and the water
move and mix in the

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.567
atmosphere?

00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:20.733
That's the winds.

00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:22.867
Also, storms. How do
storms--We're going to be

00:07:22.867 --> 00:07:26.367
talking about in some organized
way, I hope, the

00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:29.500
different kinds of storms:
thunderstorms, frontal

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.467
cyclones, tropical cyclones,
and so on.

00:07:33.467 --> 00:07:36.167
So we're very interested in the
basic physics of how the

00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:40.300
atmosphere in the ocean move.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.600
For example, in the atmosphere,
we're going to be

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.267
studying clouds.

00:07:44.267 --> 00:07:46.867
How do clouds form?

00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:49.100
What is a cloud made of?

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.867
And why do very few clouds
precipitate, but some do?

00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:56.300
And we want to ask that question
because it has to do

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.300
with climate, which brings
me to a big part of

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.700
the course is climate.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.833
Climate is defined usually as
kind of average weather.

00:08:05.833 --> 00:08:07.200
I don't like that definition.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.133
I'll give you a better one when
we come to that section

00:08:10.133 --> 00:08:10.767
of the course.

00:08:10.767 --> 00:08:15.100
But we certainly want to
understand how climate varies

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.200
around the globe.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.200
Why does Central Africa have
a different climate than

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.567
Connecticut, which is different
from Southern

00:08:22.567 --> 00:08:25.600
California, which is different
from, well, any place?

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.633
There's a distribution of
climates around the planet

00:08:29.633 --> 00:08:34.700
that controls how people live,
how they do their agriculture,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.633
how they live their
daily lives.

00:08:36.633 --> 00:08:38.033
We really want to
understand that.

00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:40.367
That's a key part of this course
is understanding the

00:08:40.367 --> 00:08:46.833
distribution of climates and
the impact on human beings

00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:47.967
around the globe.

00:08:47.967 --> 00:08:50.567
And of course, once we
understand that, we can then

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:54.167
go on to the subject of
change in climates.

00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:57.767
How have climates changed over
the history of the earth, and

00:08:57.767 --> 00:09:02.333
how might they change
in the future?

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:12.733
And of course, the human impact
as well, not only how

00:09:12.733 --> 00:09:16.033
climate impacts humans, but how
do humans impact climate

00:09:16.033 --> 00:09:20.567
as a subject of increasing
importance?

00:09:20.567 --> 00:09:23.467
So questions yet?

00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:25.267
All right.

00:09:25.267 --> 00:09:27.700
Now I've already mentioned this
but the way you're going

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.333
to be studying this course,
there are about five to six

00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:34.233
different things you need to be
looking at for sources of

00:09:34.233 --> 00:09:39.067
information: the book, my
lectures, which are more

00:09:39.067 --> 00:09:42.433
quantitative, the problem sets,
which are quantitative.

00:09:42.433 --> 00:09:46.033
We're going to have three exams
during the semester.

00:09:46.033 --> 00:09:48.433
Now why am I listing that as
something you learn from?

00:09:48.433 --> 00:09:51.633
Well, of course, you'll be
tested on these exams. But I

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:56.667
think you could also learn a lot
from taking these exams.

00:09:56.667 --> 00:09:59.600
Through the lab, you'll be
having lab exercises,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.533
including a field trip for
getting up on the roof

00:10:02.533 --> 00:10:06.233
launching balloons, measuring
things in the atmosphere.

00:10:06.233 --> 00:10:07.633
You'll learn a lot
from doing that.

00:10:07.633 --> 00:10:11.633
But the one thing that I can't
control, it's entirely in your

00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:18.300
hands, is to develop a new
habit of observing the

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.100
environment as you
walk around.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.833
So for example, when you walk
to class every morning, and

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:29.333
for some of you, it's a good
walk, instead of just turning

00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:34.233
on your iPod or zoning out,
start to look up and around,

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:36.633
and try to figure out what's
going on that day.

00:10:36.633 --> 00:10:37.733
What clouds are up there?

00:10:37.733 --> 00:10:40.533
What direction are
they moving?

00:10:40.533 --> 00:10:43.000
What direction is the
wind blowing in?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.633
Are there clouds at different
altitudes moving in different

00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:46.900
directions?

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.533
That's a really important
thing to know.

00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:51.833
So that's a new habit.

00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:57.100
Now I want to tell you something
about this because

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:02.733
you're all online several
times a day probably.

00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:08.867
And let me see if I can just
give you some good sources.

00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:16.300
I put this little document--

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.100
oh, I lost my control here.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.367
Wait a minute.

00:11:23.033 --> 00:11:26.767
I put this document up on the
Classes server last night, so

00:11:26.767 --> 00:11:28.700
you have it there.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.700
But when something interesting
is happening in New Haven,

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.333
like happened last weekend with
Hurricane Irene, I love

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:42.967
to go on to these data sources
and follow along and see

00:11:42.967 --> 00:11:44.667
what's happening
with the storm.

00:11:44.667 --> 00:11:46.733
And of course, you don't
have to do it that way.

00:11:46.733 --> 00:11:49.367
You can tune in to
the television.

00:11:49.367 --> 00:11:53.533
The television weather guy is
more than happy to give you

00:11:53.533 --> 00:11:56.100
his or her interpretations
of what's

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.300
happening with the weather.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.767
But you don't have to be
satisfied with that.

00:11:59.767 --> 00:12:02.133
You can go to the data itself.

00:12:02.133 --> 00:12:04.167
And that's more fun than
just listen to

00:12:04.167 --> 00:12:06.567
someone talk about it.

00:12:06.567 --> 00:12:11.467
So a few sites that I find
really useful, one is this

00:12:11.467 --> 00:12:15.000
Tides Online site.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.633
Most of these are .gov. They're

00:12:16.633 --> 00:12:19.767
government sources for this.

00:12:19.767 --> 00:12:23.767
Now you can go to coastal cities
all around the coast of

00:12:23.767 --> 00:12:24.433
our country.

00:12:24.433 --> 00:12:28.367
But what I've done here is
go to the New Haven one.

00:12:28.367 --> 00:12:31.533
And let me darken this
a little bit so you

00:12:31.533 --> 00:12:32.767
can see that better.

00:12:39.867 --> 00:12:47.100
There's time on this axis and
feet above mean low water.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.967
So this is a record of tides
for New Haven Harbor.

00:12:49.967 --> 00:12:53.467
It's at the coast guard station
right on the east side

00:12:53.467 --> 00:12:55.033
of the harbor there.

00:12:55.033 --> 00:13:01.300
And the blue curve is what was
predicted for the tides based

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.533
on the moon and the sun.

00:13:02.533 --> 00:13:02.767
Right?

00:13:02.767 --> 00:13:04.300
The moon and the sun produce--

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.100
their gravitational pull
produces a tide in the ocean.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.767
Here in New Haven and most
places around the world, it's

00:13:10.767 --> 00:13:15.933
a semidiurnal tide, that is to
say it's a twice a day tide,

00:13:15.933 --> 00:13:18.133
two high tides and
two low tides.

00:13:18.133 --> 00:13:21.533
And that's what you see
in the blue curve.

00:13:21.533 --> 00:13:23.533
The red curve is what's
actually measured.

00:13:23.533 --> 00:13:25.533
They've got a water
level gauge there.

00:13:25.533 --> 00:13:27.967
And as it goes up,
they record that.

00:13:27.967 --> 00:13:32.933
And now this date goes back to
the twenty-eighth and the

00:13:32.933 --> 00:13:35.233
twenty-seventh, which
was last weekend.

00:13:35.233 --> 00:13:41.567
And what you see here is that
the sea water level rose quite

00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:45.367
a bit above what was predicted
from the normal tides.

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:47.900
And of course, that's what's
called the storm surge.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.167
Right?

00:13:48.167 --> 00:13:52.800
So as Hurricane Irene came up
the coast and with the winds

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:59.300
blowing counterclockwise around
it, as it approach, the

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.367
winds were from the east. In
fact, that's on this curve.

00:14:02.367 --> 00:14:04.600
I'll show it to you
in just a minute.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.167
Well, that wind from the east
pushed water into Long Island.

00:14:09.167 --> 00:14:11.467
And the water level rose.

00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:13.933
And they subtracted one curve
from the other to get the

00:14:13.933 --> 00:14:14.600
green curve.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.100
So that's the difference between
the observed water

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.933
level and the predicted
tide level.

00:14:19.933 --> 00:14:24.900
And you see that it rose about
four feet above normal, and

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.533
then dropped a couple of
feet below, and then

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:28.667
came back to normal.

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:32.133
So that's a typical example of
what happens with sea level as

00:14:32.133 --> 00:14:33.900
the hurricane comes up.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.900
Now, here's the wind data.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.867
It's too small for you read
through the back, so I'll try

00:14:37.867 --> 00:14:39.967
to walk through it.

00:14:39.967 --> 00:14:41.733
The same time scale
is on the bottom.

00:14:41.733 --> 00:14:45.400
You're spanning about
three or four days.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.733
This is in knots, which
is a traditional

00:14:48.733 --> 00:14:51.233
unit of wind speed.

00:14:51.233 --> 00:14:54.200
Unfortunately, it's not the
one we'll use primarily.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.400
We'll use meters per second.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.867
But knots is a traditional
speed.

00:14:58.867 --> 00:15:01.833
A knot is a nautical
mile per hour.

00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:03.567
So it's kind of like
a mile per hour but

00:15:03.567 --> 00:15:05.400
a little bit greater.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:10.133
So the wind speed increased
as the Hurricane Irene

00:15:10.133 --> 00:15:10.833
approached.

00:15:10.833 --> 00:15:13.000
And from the little vectors that
you can see, the wind was

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:20.200
from the east. It reached a peak
of about 30, 32 knots.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.700
And then as the storm
moved away,

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.333
the wind speed decreased.

00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:29.167
But then the wind was from
the west. Remember?

00:15:29.167 --> 00:15:32.333
So just to sketch this out
if I can for a second.

00:15:35.933 --> 00:15:38.033
So here we are in New Haven.

00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:40.900
And the cyclone is like
this, winds going

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.867
around in that direction.

00:15:43.867 --> 00:15:47.233
As it approaches us, the winds
are going to be from the east.

00:15:47.233 --> 00:15:51.833
And then as it passes by a day
later, the top here, the winds

00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:53.367
have the same direction
around it.

00:15:53.367 --> 00:15:56.500
Suddenly, the winds are from
the west. So you're seeing

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.867
that pattern there.

00:15:57.867 --> 00:16:01.267
And then, of course, that's
what's reflected

00:16:01.267 --> 00:16:02.533
in the storm surge.

00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:05.300
First, it pushes water into
Long Island Sound.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.133
Then it pushes the water back
out of Long Island.

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.867
So it's not too complicated.

00:16:09.867 --> 00:16:12.533
And the data is right there
for you to see.

00:16:17.767 --> 00:16:21.333
So here's another one.

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:26.400
If you go on to water data USGS,
that's the United States

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:31.833
Geological Survey, and hit on
the Quinnipiac River, which is

00:16:31.833 --> 00:16:35.133
the main river that comes down
through New Haven, there's

00:16:35.133 --> 00:16:38.300
three rivers, we're going to
do a field trip along the

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.900
Quinnipiac as part of
lab two or three.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.367
So you'll learn a lot about
the Quinnipiac.

00:16:43.367 --> 00:16:47.100
But I went on just after the
hurricane to get this data.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.600
This is the river discharge.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.700
Again, it's not in a metric
unit, I'm afraid.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.233
It's in cubic feet per second.

00:16:53.233 --> 00:16:56.267
That's how much water is
coming down the river.

00:16:56.267 --> 00:17:00.200
And these are dates along,
August 23, 24, 25, 26, so on.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.700
So that, of course,
is the big--

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.667
By the way, this is a
logarithmic scale.

00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:09.900
So that's a really big increase
in the amount of

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.667
water coming down the rivers.

00:17:11.667 --> 00:17:15.100
And of course, that's because
of the heavy rain that fell

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.167
from the hurricane.

00:17:16.167 --> 00:17:18.300
So check that one out as well.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.933
Let me see what else
I have that I

00:17:20.933 --> 00:17:22.833
think is really important.

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:24.267
Well, the radar--

00:17:24.267 --> 00:17:27.567
I love to watch the radar.

00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:31.167
You can get there a lot of
different ways, for example,

00:17:31.167 --> 00:17:36.333
radar.weather.gov. But usually,
I go right to the--

00:17:36.333 --> 00:17:40.467
the closest weather radar
to us is on Long Island.

00:17:40.467 --> 00:17:45.833
It's about here at a station
called Upton, U-P-T-O-N. So if

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:51.167
you just Google Upton radar or
Upton NOAA radar, you'll go

00:17:51.167 --> 00:17:52.100
right to that site.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:57.300
And you get a nice visual
representation of the

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.833
precipitation in the region.

00:17:58.833 --> 00:18:00.600
One thing to remember about
radar, I think you

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.867
know what it is.

00:18:01.867 --> 00:18:04.133
It's a microwave signal
that gets sent out

00:18:04.133 --> 00:18:07.900
from the radar antenna.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.833
It scatters off raindrops
and then

00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:15.433
comes back to the receiver.

00:18:15.433 --> 00:18:19.233
And from the time it takes for
the signal to go out and back,

00:18:19.233 --> 00:18:20.800
you get the distance.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.633
And of course, from how the
antenna was aimed, you know

00:18:23.633 --> 00:18:25.000
the azimuth angle, so
you could figure

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.900
out where that is.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.800
And it's put together in
a nice map like this.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.600
This was taken just as the front
part of the cyclone was

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.633
coming into Southern
New England.

00:18:36.633 --> 00:18:40.167
And you see this nice heavy
rain shield out here.

00:18:40.167 --> 00:18:42.900
The eye of the storm is
probably about here.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.133
It wasn't a very well
developed eye.

00:18:44.133 --> 00:18:46.967
But the center of it was
probably about here.

00:18:46.967 --> 00:18:50.233
And the backside was fairly
dry, surprisingly dry.

00:18:50.233 --> 00:18:51.667
We'll talk about
that later on.

00:18:51.667 --> 00:18:55.367
Some people think that it was
transitioning away from a

00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:57.900
tropical cyclone to a different
type of a storm at

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.467
this point.

00:18:58.467 --> 00:19:02.833
But that's getting ahead
of the story.

00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:06.100
But you can check--I check it
frequently when I'm about to

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.167
walk out to go someplace
on campus.

00:19:09.167 --> 00:19:13.100
And sometimes I'll go on to the
Upton radar and just check

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.167
the radar to see if
it's raining.

00:19:15.167 --> 00:19:17.833
I got a window, but what I
really want to know is not

00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:22.067
whether it's raining now, but
is it going to rain in 5, 10

00:19:22.067 --> 00:19:22.900
or 20 minutes.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:28.700
Well, if I see a big squall line
coming towards New Haven,

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.533
then I can decide whether--
maybe I can sprint to where

00:19:31.533 --> 00:19:33.167
I'm going before
it gets there.

00:19:33.167 --> 00:19:36.733
Or maybe I better just wait
until it runs through, and

00:19:36.733 --> 00:19:39.033
then I'll walk off to my car
or walk off to my meeting.

00:19:39.033 --> 00:19:41.300
So that is a very nice--

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.633
in meteorology, we got a
funny word for that.

00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:45.733
We call it nowcasting.

00:19:45.733 --> 00:19:50.100
It's like forecasting except
it's forecasting for just the

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.700
next few minutes.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.933
And the best way to do that is
with the Upton radar because

00:19:54.933 --> 00:19:56.033
that will tell you--

00:19:56.033 --> 00:19:57.900
New Haven's right there.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.833
And it'll tell you if there's
a little thunderstorm or

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:04.733
something just about to
move over New Haven.

00:20:04.733 --> 00:20:08.467
So it's very, very convenient
for that purpose.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.867
Another great one, of course,
is the satellites.

00:20:15.867 --> 00:20:20.567
And there's a picture
of Irene.

00:20:20.567 --> 00:20:25.933
Now there's lots of ways to
get at the satellite data.

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:30.767
www.goes.noaa.gov is
one way to do it.

00:20:30.767 --> 00:20:36.500
And GOES stands for
Geostationary

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.833
Environmental Satellite.

00:20:37.833 --> 00:20:41.367
That means it's a satellite
that is--

00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:44.267
it's over the equator.

00:20:44.267 --> 00:20:50.467
And it takes twenty-four hours
to go around its orbit, just

00:20:50.467 --> 00:20:52.500
like the Earth takes
twenty-four hours

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.467
to spin on its axis.

00:20:54.467 --> 00:20:58.967
So it stays over the same
point on the equator.

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:01.667
So we say it's geostationary.

00:21:01.667 --> 00:21:04.167
It's like it's parked
right up there.

00:21:04.167 --> 00:21:09.467
And it's the best satellite for
watching cloud patterns

00:21:09.467 --> 00:21:11.567
develop and move.

00:21:11.567 --> 00:21:14.200
Because you're not just getting
an occasional snapshot

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.167
when the satellite comes
back around.

00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:18.300
No, that satellite is there.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.033
And it's taking a picture
about every 10 minutes.

00:21:21.033 --> 00:21:25.400
So you get a really good way
to follow the structure of

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.533
these cloud patterns as they're
swirling around.

00:21:27.533 --> 00:21:28.800
So there's a good example.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.200
Now, also notice these clouds
are quite different than the

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.467
ones up here.

00:21:33.467 --> 00:21:35.033
The radar show that
these were not

00:21:35.033 --> 00:21:37.033
precipitating, but these were.

00:21:37.033 --> 00:21:39.967
So the deeper clouds with the
big anvils on them were

00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:42.267
precipitating, but these
low level clouds

00:21:42.267 --> 00:21:44.067
were not at that moment.

00:21:44.067 --> 00:21:45.333
Any questions on this?

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.767
Well, do I have anything else?

00:21:52.767 --> 00:21:53.200
Oh, yes.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.233
So this gets a little more
techie maybe, but I love it.

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:00.100
And that's getting the
balloons sounding.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:06.200
So the National Weather
Service launches

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.567
balloons--weather balloons
--twice a day from a couple of

00:22:10.567 --> 00:22:16.767
hundred places around the United
States and 400 or 500

00:22:16.767 --> 00:22:18.033
around the globe.

00:22:18.033 --> 00:22:20.600
And they're all accessible.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.833
The balloons are launched
at 00:00 and

00:22:23.833 --> 00:22:27.733
12:00 universal time.

00:22:27.733 --> 00:22:30.467
You're going to have to become
familiar with what we call

00:22:30.467 --> 00:22:31.433
universal time.

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:35.200
Sometimes we call it Greenwich
Mean Time.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.567
In the military, it's
called Zulu Time.

00:22:38.567 --> 00:22:41.867
We'll most of the time call
it just universal time.

00:22:41.867 --> 00:22:48.567
And so 00:00 and 12:00 universal
time, when we're on

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:50.633
Eastern Daylight Time, like
we're on right now, it would

00:22:50.633 --> 00:22:54.300
be 8 o'clock in the morning and
8 o'clock in the evening.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.933
So those balloons are launched
at 8 o'clock in the morning, 8

00:22:56.933 --> 00:22:59.800
o'clock in the evening.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.467
They'll launch them a few
minutes before that time

00:23:02.467 --> 00:23:04.200
because they take a couple
hours to rise.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.733
But if you go on to--

00:23:06.733 --> 00:23:09.033
what I usually do is go on to
the University of Wyoming

00:23:09.033 --> 00:23:13.267
website because they got a
really great website where you

00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:18.200
can get all the soundings all
the way back in time.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.900
Back 50 years, you can get
soundings from all these

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.133
different sites.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.267
So that's a really handy
one to go into.

00:23:26.267 --> 00:23:29.100
So what I did here was
pull off the--

00:23:33.367 --> 00:23:38.633
I forgot to say, the closest
radius on site to us is also

00:23:38.633 --> 00:23:41.567
Upton, New York, same place
where that radar is.

00:23:41.567 --> 00:23:43.300
They launch balloons
from there as well.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.867
So what I did here was to
go on to the Upton--

00:23:45.867 --> 00:23:52.033
Wyoming site, pull down the
sounding as the storm was

00:23:52.033 --> 00:23:55.867
approaching, and then
as it was leaving.

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:59.467
So this is a balloon carrying
a small instrument package.

00:23:59.467 --> 00:24:01.433
You'll be working with
this kind of data

00:24:01.433 --> 00:24:03.133
later in the course.

00:24:03.133 --> 00:24:07.300
So this is a little
bit of a preview.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.500
But what's plotted here is,
well, I'll say altitude.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:16.867
But really it's pressure because
that's how we know how

00:24:16.867 --> 00:24:19.733
high the balloon is from the
pressure that it is recording.

00:24:19.733 --> 00:24:21.933
Pressure decreases as you
go up in the atmosphere.

00:24:21.933 --> 00:24:25.533
So it's a convenient way to keep
track of your altitude.

00:24:25.533 --> 00:24:28.267
And then on this scale
is temperature.

00:24:28.267 --> 00:24:30.733
And two lines are plotted, one
is the air temperature, one is

00:24:30.733 --> 00:24:32.667
the due point.

00:24:32.667 --> 00:24:34.800
So when they're close together,
that means the air

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.367
is saturated with water.

00:24:36.367 --> 00:24:39.633
So that's not a surprise, that
as this hurricane was coming

00:24:39.633 --> 00:24:44.233
over us, the air was saturated
at least three or four miles

00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:45.833
up in the atmosphere.

00:24:45.833 --> 00:24:48.300
Maybe that's not saturated,
but it probably is too.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.700
Probably that's just an
instrument air or something to

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.933
do with ice versus water.

00:24:52.933 --> 00:24:54.600
It's probably saturated
all the way up.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.267
And then the winds are given
over here in a traditional,

00:24:58.267 --> 00:25:02.533
meteorological wind barb.

00:25:02.533 --> 00:25:03.767
It's a little feather
that you draw--

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.033
a little arrow with
feathers on it.

00:25:09.033 --> 00:25:11.300
And the number of feathers
tell you how

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.533
fast the wind is blowing.

00:25:12.533 --> 00:25:13.967
And the direction
tells you what

00:25:13.967 --> 00:25:15.733
direction the wind is blowing.

00:25:15.733 --> 00:25:20.200
So for example, here, the wind
was, I think, 30 knots from

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.933
the east. Well, that
makes sense.

00:25:22.933 --> 00:25:24.500
That's when the storm
was approaching.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.533
So here in Southern Connecticut
or Long Island,

00:25:27.533 --> 00:25:29.333
the wind is from the east.

00:25:29.333 --> 00:25:32.867
And then as the storm was moving
away, we had 40 knots

00:25:32.867 --> 00:25:39.000
from the west. That was taken
twelve hours later, 00Z on the

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.067
28th and 00Z on the
twenty-ninth.

00:25:41.067 --> 00:25:45.700
That kind of brackets the
hurricane passage.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.533
And then you can see this
begins to dry out

00:25:47.533 --> 00:25:48.467
a little bit aloft.

00:25:48.467 --> 00:25:51.033
You saw those low clouds
in the satellite image.

00:25:51.033 --> 00:25:52.467
That's this saturated air.

00:25:52.467 --> 00:25:54.633
But then it was drier aloft.

00:25:54.633 --> 00:25:57.267
So you can understand that
vertical cloud structure we

00:25:57.267 --> 00:26:00.500
saw in the satellite
image by looking

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.667
at the balloon sounding.

00:26:01.667 --> 00:26:05.333
So this is great because this
stuff is online all the time.

00:26:05.333 --> 00:26:10.033
And so whenever something's
happening not only here, but

00:26:10.033 --> 00:26:13.933
anywhere, go on to the website,
take a look at it.

00:26:13.933 --> 00:26:17.700
And I'd like you to work with
this raw data rather than just

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:22.700
listen to what the weather
forecaster has to say.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.100
Question?

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:23.567
Yeah.

00:26:23.567 --> 00:26:25.200
STUDENT: Does it make
a difference if

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.633
those lines were connected?

00:26:26.633 --> 00:26:28.433
Some of them kind of
look like a flag--

00:26:28.433 --> 00:26:30.400
PROFESSOR: Oh, here you mean?

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:30.633
Yeah.

00:26:30.633 --> 00:26:34.300
So there's a little
thick barb there.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.733
That's the 50 knot.

00:26:36.733 --> 00:26:38.367
It's kind of like Roman
numerals in a way.

00:26:38.367 --> 00:26:39.567
So that's 40.

00:26:39.567 --> 00:26:42.467
That's 55, a thick
and a short.

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:43.800
Short is 5.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.000
A long is 10.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.767
And the thick one is 50.

00:26:46.767 --> 00:26:49.333
So it's kind of like a Roman
numeral way of keeping track

00:26:49.333 --> 00:26:50.367
of wind speed.

00:26:50.367 --> 00:26:50.733
Yeah?

00:26:50.733 --> 00:26:53.967
STUDENT: You told us two lines
measure, one was air

00:26:53.967 --> 00:26:55.200
temperature, one's due point.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.467
Is there a reason why the second
one-- like the first

00:26:57.467 --> 00:26:59.633
one goes all the way up and
the second one --like the

00:26:59.633 --> 00:26:59.967
first one goes all the way up
and the second one like one of

00:26:59.967 --> 00:27:01.133
them kind of stops short?

00:27:01.133 --> 00:27:02.033
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:02.033 --> 00:27:06.400
Probably it got so dry that
the sensor could not

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.100
accurately measure.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.400
So they probably just stop
the data because

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.933
they're getting too dry.

00:27:12.933 --> 00:27:15.167
We were getting--as that cyclone
moved away, we were

00:27:15.167 --> 00:27:17.467
getting cold air coming
in behind it

00:27:17.467 --> 00:27:19.367
descending down from Canada.

00:27:19.367 --> 00:27:21.200
And that was very dry air.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.400
And you're getting a hint of
it, but then I think the

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.533
sensor probably couldn't
keep track of the real

00:27:26.533 --> 00:27:28.467
dry air behind it.

00:27:28.467 --> 00:27:29.900
It's not a perfect instrument.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.533
Be aware of that.

00:27:30.533 --> 00:27:33.633
Whenever you're looking
at real data, it's not

00:27:33.633 --> 00:27:35.200
necessarily always going
to be perfect.

00:27:37.733 --> 00:27:38.967
Other questions on this?

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.067
OK.

00:27:43.067 --> 00:27:46.567
Well, let's see what else
we have to do today.

00:27:50.033 --> 00:27:55.633
So I've gone through all the
things that I wanted you to be

00:27:55.633 --> 00:27:59.567
aware of as sources
of information.

00:27:59.567 --> 00:28:03.567
And I think there's just a
couple of other things I want

00:28:03.567 --> 00:28:05.100
to do today.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.167
Oh, before I forget, I want to
say a couple words about

00:28:09.167 --> 00:28:16.500
myself because some of you may
be curious to know what I do,

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:21.400
although it may become obvious
as the semester unfolds.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.633
So I started out in--

00:28:25.567 --> 00:28:28.600
when I started college, I had
no idea I was going to move

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.600
into geoscience, or geophysics,

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.433
or atmospheric science.

00:28:32.433 --> 00:28:34.533
I was interested in airplanes.

00:28:34.533 --> 00:28:36.100
I want to fly airplanes.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.433
And so I got an undergraduate
degree in aeronautical

00:28:39.433 --> 00:28:42.500
engineering and a master's
degree in aeronautical

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.767
engineering.

00:28:44.767 --> 00:28:48.467
I thought I was going to
be a military pilot.

00:28:48.467 --> 00:28:53.967
And then things developed in the
way that made me realize

00:28:53.967 --> 00:28:57.767
maybe that's not my career
goal after all.

00:28:57.767 --> 00:29:00.333
So I switched--I went in the
navy for three years, spent

00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:02.800
some time on ships.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.767
And during that three years,
I realize I was really more

00:29:06.767 --> 00:29:12.833
interested in the atmosphere in
which the airplanes fly and

00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:17.233
the oceans than I was in the
airplanes themselves.

00:29:17.233 --> 00:29:22.433
So as many of you will find, the
careers you have in mind

00:29:22.433 --> 00:29:24.733
right now may not be the
ones you end up with.

00:29:24.733 --> 00:29:30.233
Because as you have new
experiences, you realize there

00:29:30.233 --> 00:29:33.033
are other interesting things
to do out there.

00:29:33.033 --> 00:29:38.033
And so just be flexible and
keep your options open.

00:29:38.033 --> 00:29:40.233
So when I got out of the
military, I went back to

00:29:40.233 --> 00:29:44.533
school then in geoscience, the
study of the earth, and its

00:29:44.533 --> 00:29:48.700
atmosphere, and its oceans, and
developed a career there.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.300
So my interests today are
primarily in what I call

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.867
regional climates.

00:29:54.867 --> 00:29:57.367
How does a climate one part
of the world differ from a

00:29:57.367 --> 00:29:59.700
climate somewhere else?

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.167
Does that have to do with just
where it stands on the earth,

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:03.800
its latitude, its longitude?

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.733
No, it also has to do with local
features in the land:

00:30:07.733 --> 00:30:12.400
coastlines, mountains, land
surface structure.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.967
So these are the things that
I'm interested today.

00:30:14.967 --> 00:30:18.133
I've done projects in many
places around the world trying

00:30:18.133 --> 00:30:21.267
to understand how the
local climates in

00:30:21.267 --> 00:30:23.000
those regions work.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.333
So you'll find as I go through
the course that I'll be

00:30:25.333 --> 00:30:31.767
occasionally referring to some
of the work that has been done

00:30:31.767 --> 00:30:34.533
in that area.

00:30:34.533 --> 00:30:36.433
Are there questions?

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.400
OK.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.567
Well, you're not going to get
away today without a little

00:30:42.567 --> 00:30:43.900
bit of lecture.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:47.333
So I wanted to run through
one argument--

00:30:47.333 --> 00:30:49.067
I think we have time
for that today--

00:30:51.833 --> 00:30:56.333
that I think is important for
forming a foundation for

00:30:56.333 --> 00:30:59.233
everything else we
do in class.

00:30:59.233 --> 00:31:03.000
And so I'm going to address this
one question, what is an

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.233
atmosphere?

00:31:13.933 --> 00:31:25.733
My answer is going to be that
it's a layer of gas held to a

00:31:25.733 --> 00:31:31.400
planet by its gravitational
field.

00:31:41.267 --> 00:31:45.133
So that's my definition
of an atmosphere.

00:31:45.133 --> 00:31:49.067
And I want to illustrate this
by doing what's called a

00:31:49.067 --> 00:31:50.667
Gedanken experiment.

00:31:50.667 --> 00:31:55.300
A Gedanken experiment is a
thought experiment, comes from

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.400
the German word for thought.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.033
So we're not actually
do this experiment.

00:31:59.033 --> 00:32:00.233
We're going to think
our way through it.

00:32:00.233 --> 00:32:04.433
And so here is my little
Gedanken experiment.

00:32:04.433 --> 00:32:05.833
I got a planet here.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:18.067
It has some mass, M,
has no atmosphere.

00:32:18.067 --> 00:32:19.233
But I got an alien.

00:32:19.233 --> 00:32:23.133
I've hired this alien to
bring in an atmosphere.

00:32:23.133 --> 00:32:27.533
And he's over here, and
he's got a box of air.

00:32:27.533 --> 00:32:28.967
And the molecules are there.

00:32:32.267 --> 00:32:33.867
And he's far away from Earth.

00:32:33.867 --> 00:32:36.700
So he doesn't feel the
gravitational field of the

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.233
planet yet.

00:32:38.233 --> 00:32:40.667
And so these molecules are
going to be uniformly

00:32:40.667 --> 00:32:42.233
distributed through the box.

00:32:42.233 --> 00:32:47.000
They don't feel the tug yet from
the planet that's going

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.133
to maybe want to squeeze
them towards this

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:50.067
corner of the box.

00:32:50.067 --> 00:32:52.367
They're too far away for that.

00:32:52.367 --> 00:32:55.200
So they're just sitting there
freely bouncing around in the

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.567
box having a good time.

00:32:57.567 --> 00:32:59.933
Then we bring that box
down to Earth.

00:33:02.867 --> 00:33:05.500
We set it there for a minute.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:11.667
Well, now it feels the gravity
field of that planet.

00:33:11.667 --> 00:33:13.433
Now the molecules are
still moving around.

00:33:13.433 --> 00:33:14.100
They're bouncing.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.933
There's pressure in that gas.

00:33:16.933 --> 00:33:18.867
But the gravity field is going
to play a role too.

00:33:18.867 --> 00:33:21.733
So more of those molecules are
going to sink to the bottom.

00:33:21.733 --> 00:33:24.033
There's going to be a few
up here at the top.

00:33:24.033 --> 00:33:27.067
But most of them are going to
be down at the bottom simply

00:33:27.067 --> 00:33:31.833
because of that gravitational
field.

00:33:31.833 --> 00:33:35.600
And then the final step of this
experiment is I'm just

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.767
going to open a door.

00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:41.067
When I open the door, that
gas is just going

00:33:41.067 --> 00:33:42.600
to flow right out.

00:33:45.267 --> 00:33:48.100
The box is going to become
empty, and I'm going to have

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.067
an atmosphere.

00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:52.600
Obviously, it's held to
the planet by that

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.667
gravitational field.

00:33:54.667 --> 00:33:56.967
Just like it was in the box
here, there's going to be few

00:33:56.967 --> 00:34:02.133
more molecules down below
and fewer up at the top.

00:34:02.133 --> 00:34:06.933
So you're going to have that
gradient because of the

00:34:06.933 --> 00:34:07.533
gravity field.

00:34:07.533 --> 00:34:12.100
But basically, it's going
to be held there

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.033
by the gravity field.

00:34:13.033 --> 00:34:18.533
So that's what I mean by layer
of gas held to the planet by

00:34:18.533 --> 00:34:19.300
the gravity field.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.433
Now, a couple of things that
I've already misled you about.

00:34:25.767 --> 00:34:29.067
First of all, of course, that
isn't how planets get their

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.333
atmospheres.

00:34:30.333 --> 00:34:33.100
They're not brought
in by aliens.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:38.767
There are two leading theories
for how a planet really get

00:34:38.767 --> 00:34:39.767
its atmosphere.

00:34:39.767 --> 00:34:43.500
One is that it is a so-called
primordial atmosphere.

00:34:47.867 --> 00:34:51.767
That is to say it was formed
with the condensing planet.

00:35:03.867 --> 00:35:07.933
When the planet was first
formed, it was formed from

00:35:07.933 --> 00:35:11.167
material out in space that
was collected together

00:35:11.167 --> 00:35:16.333
gravitationally, kind of
a gravitational inflow.

00:35:16.333 --> 00:35:18.433
And at the same time, there
would have been lighter

00:35:18.433 --> 00:35:20.367
molecules out there that
didn't want to become

00:35:20.367 --> 00:35:23.133
incorporated in the solid
planet's surface.

00:35:23.133 --> 00:35:25.733
But they would have been
attracted too.

00:35:25.733 --> 00:35:28.400
And so you would have formed the
solid atmosphere from the

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.533
heavier compounds or ones that
like to bond together.

00:35:32.533 --> 00:35:36.267
And the lighter molecules or
the ones that don't like to

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:39.300
bond together would have
formed this envelope

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.300
of gas around it.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.800
So that's one possibility.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.167
The other is that--

00:35:46.167 --> 00:35:48.967
well, maybe there was an
atmosphere formed in this way.

00:35:48.967 --> 00:35:52.767
But maybe it was lost. After
all, the earth is almost 6

00:35:52.767 --> 00:35:54.000
billion years old.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.500
So whatever atmosphere it had
at the beginning isn't

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:02.033
necessarily the same atmosphere
we have today.

00:36:02.033 --> 00:36:04.133
We'll talk about
that next time.

00:36:04.133 --> 00:36:10.733
But even if the atmosphere was
never there or was lost, the

00:36:10.733 --> 00:36:14.500
planet could still over
geologic time give off

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.600
additional gases from
its interior.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.900
I'll just call that
outgassing.

00:36:22.867 --> 00:36:27.100
For example, if you go to a
volcano today, you could

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.500
measure gases coming out
of the planet into the

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.600
atmosphere.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.533
So this is an active dynamic
ongoing process where gases

00:36:34.533 --> 00:36:39.267
come from the interior of
the planet out into

00:36:39.267 --> 00:36:41.067
the atmosphere itself.

00:36:41.067 --> 00:36:45.600
So either one or some
combination of the two is

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.100
where the Earth and the other
planets actually got their

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:48.900
atmosphere from.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.133
Now, I misled you in another
way too, the

00:36:52.133 --> 00:36:53.633
way I've drawn that.

00:36:53.633 --> 00:36:54.833
I've drawn the atmosphere

00:36:54.833 --> 00:36:57.633
relatively thick that distance.

00:36:57.633 --> 00:37:03.300
If I called the radius of the
planet capital R and the

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:07.700
thickness of the atmosphere,
let me call that little d,

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:13.033
I've drawn them with the ratio
about five or six to one.

00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:15.733
Actually, the ratio is much
smaller than that.

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:24.800
If I take the ratio of d to R
for the Earth, the radius is

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:31.033
about 6,370 kilometers.

00:37:31.033 --> 00:37:33.733
Whereas the depth of the
atmosphere-- it's a little bit

00:37:33.733 --> 00:37:36.567
hard to define the depth of the
atmosphere because it has

00:37:36.567 --> 00:37:38.600
a gradual top.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.000
There isn't suddenly a
level where suddenly

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.867
the atmosphere stops.

00:37:41.867 --> 00:37:45.933
But I'll make a rough estimate
and say 100 kilometers.

00:37:45.933 --> 00:37:48.567
So that's a lot smaller ratio
than I've drawn there.

00:37:48.567 --> 00:37:53.933
In fact, probably more like the
thickness of my pen line

00:37:53.933 --> 00:37:57.300
would be a more accurate
representation of how thick

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.733
the atmosphere is relative
to the planet itself.

00:38:03.333 --> 00:38:04.567
Questions on that?

00:38:09.133 --> 00:38:09.600
Yes?

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.333
STUDENT: Is like the ratio
of the thickness of the

00:38:10.333 --> 00:38:10.533
atmosphere to the planet stable,
or are we constantly

00:38:10.533 --> 00:38:11.800
losing gas?

00:38:17.433 --> 00:38:18.833
PROFESSOR: We are.

00:38:18.833 --> 00:38:20.267
I'm going to talk about
that next time.

00:38:20.267 --> 00:38:22.300
I'm going to talk about
the loss mechanism.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.333
And we're going to compare the
different planets, some of

00:38:26.333 --> 00:38:29.700
which have lost all their gases,
some of which have

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.400
retained some, like the Earth,
and some of which have

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.300
retained almost everything,
like Jupiter.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:39.433
So we're going to put that
into a context next time.

00:38:39.433 --> 00:38:42.433
Anything else?

00:38:42.433 --> 00:38:42.600
OK.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:47.967
Well, I want to address
this question then.

00:38:47.967 --> 00:38:49.233
We've done that one.

00:38:51.533 --> 00:38:54.433
The Earth's atmosphere is made
primarily of nitrogen, oxygen,

00:38:54.433 --> 00:38:57.867
and a little bit of argon.

00:38:57.867 --> 00:39:03.733
And all three of those molecules
are constructed in

00:39:03.733 --> 00:39:08.267
such a way that they do not
absorb light in the wavelength

00:39:08.267 --> 00:39:11.667
range to which our
eye is sensitive.

00:39:11.667 --> 00:39:14.667
In other words, air is
invisible to us.

00:39:17.167 --> 00:39:18.033
That's interesting.

00:39:18.033 --> 00:39:21.000
So then how do we even
know there is air if

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.700
we can't see it?

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.167
How do we know there is air?

00:39:25.167 --> 00:39:28.567
Someone want to suggest a way
that we know there's air?

00:39:28.567 --> 00:39:28.867
Yeah?

00:39:28.867 --> 00:39:29.733
STUDENT: From breathing.

00:39:29.733 --> 00:39:31.300
PROFESSOR: Breathing.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.300
That's a really good one.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.167
Yes.

00:39:33.167 --> 00:39:34.033
STUDENT: Friction.

00:39:34.033 --> 00:39:34.933
PROFESSOR: Friction

00:39:34.933 --> 00:39:37.233
STUDENT: Like, friction
with regard to how--

00:39:37.233 --> 00:39:37.867
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:37.867 --> 00:39:39.767
For example, let's say I've
got this piece of

00:39:39.767 --> 00:39:42.667
paper and I drop it.

00:39:42.667 --> 00:39:45.633
It falls very slowly.

00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:50.267
If there were no atmosphere,
of course, it would fall

00:39:50.267 --> 00:39:53.700
faster than my pen
with a clunk.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.800
Well, no, there wouldn't be
a clunk, would there?

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.133
STUDENT: No sound.

00:39:57.133 --> 00:39:57.900
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.333
There's no sound.

00:39:59.333 --> 00:40:01.533
The sound is transmitted
through the air.

00:40:01.533 --> 00:40:05.867
So if there were no air, you
wouldn't hear me speaking.

00:40:05.867 --> 00:40:06.333
That'd be good.

00:40:06.333 --> 00:40:08.767
Or you wouldn't be able to
hear any noises that I'm

00:40:08.767 --> 00:40:10.133
making up here.

00:40:10.133 --> 00:40:14.167
What other ways do we know that
there's an atmosphere?

00:40:14.167 --> 00:40:14.567
Yeah?

00:40:14.567 --> 00:40:15.400
STUDENT: Pressure.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:15.900
PROFESSOR: Pressure.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:16.833
How do you know there's
pressure?

00:40:16.833 --> 00:40:17.367
STUDENT: Well when
you're up like I

00:40:17.367 --> 00:40:18.633
guess trying to breathe--

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.667
PROFESSOR: It is to breathing.

00:40:21.667 --> 00:40:23.867
STUDENT: When you're on a
mountain it's harder--

00:40:23.867 --> 00:40:24.833
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:40:24.833 --> 00:40:27.100
Is there something you're
going to do today--

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.533
think about this
pressure thing.

00:40:28.533 --> 00:40:31.100
How do we sense atmospheric
pressure?

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.400
Can have an instrument
that does it, but

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.333
how do we sense it?

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:36.733
Yeah?

00:40:36.733 --> 00:40:38.567
STUDENT: How difficult
it is to breathe?

00:40:38.567 --> 00:40:41.000
PROFESSOR: Well, not
so much because remember the

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.933
pressure is here.

00:40:42.933 --> 00:40:44.033
But it's also here.

00:40:44.033 --> 00:40:45.800
So it's kind equalizing
in a way.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.200
All we have to do with our lungs
is to produce a little

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.400
bit of difference between what's
here and what's here,

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.067
and we can breathe in and out.

00:40:54.067 --> 00:40:57.767
You could change the absolute
pressure by a factor of two.

00:40:57.767 --> 00:40:58.500
And that wouldn't change.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.667
You would still be doing pretty
much the same thing.

00:41:00.667 --> 00:41:02.067
But there maybe some other
ways in which you

00:41:02.067 --> 00:41:02.933
would notice pressure.

00:41:02.933 --> 00:41:04.467
STUDENT: Like your ears
like sinuses ?

00:41:04.467 --> 00:41:05.300
PROFESSOR: Ears.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:05.600
Yes.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:09.933
So if you got a sudden
change in pressure--

00:41:09.933 --> 00:41:13.633
for example, when the aircraft
is beginning to descend, then

00:41:13.633 --> 00:41:18.433
you might feel it in
your ears as well.

00:41:18.433 --> 00:41:21.933
I remember when I was in the
navy years ago, first part of

00:41:21.933 --> 00:41:25.767
flight training school, they
wanted to show us what it was

00:41:25.767 --> 00:41:27.533
like to have a sudden
decompression.

00:41:30.267 --> 00:41:33.300
So you're flying on an aircraft,
window pops out or

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.333
whatever happens suddenly,
you have much

00:41:35.333 --> 00:41:36.200
less air in the cabin.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.933
So they took us into a
room about the size

00:41:40.933 --> 00:41:42.867
of this area here.

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:48.033
And there was another chamber
next to it with a big pipe

00:41:48.033 --> 00:41:49.800
connecting the two.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.533
So what they did, they closed
the valve in the pipe.

00:41:52.533 --> 00:41:55.467
They pump down the
other chamber.

00:41:55.467 --> 00:41:58.833
And then all of a sudden,
they opened the valve.

00:41:58.833 --> 00:42:03.233
So half of our air
went over there.

00:42:03.233 --> 00:42:05.467
So what do you think happened?

00:42:05.467 --> 00:42:06.400
Just imagine.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.267
Let's do a Gedanken
experiment.

00:42:08.267 --> 00:42:10.800
What do you think we noticed?

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.433
Or what happened to us
when we did that?

00:42:13.433 --> 00:42:15.000
Any guesses?

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.767
STUDENT: Bloody nose?

00:42:16.767 --> 00:42:17.533
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:42:17.533 --> 00:42:19.000
STUDENT: Bloody nose?

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.300
PROFESSOR: No.

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.533
My nose didn't bleed.

00:42:25.467 --> 00:42:26.233
Other guesses?

00:42:26.233 --> 00:42:28.167
STUDENT: Your ears popped?

00:42:28.167 --> 00:42:29.367
PROFESSOR: Ears popped.

00:42:29.367 --> 00:42:29.833
Yeah.

00:42:29.833 --> 00:42:31.567
STUDENT: You got a little
light-headed?

00:42:31.567 --> 00:42:33.667
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that came later.

00:42:33.667 --> 00:42:36.533
So the first thing
that happened is

00:42:36.533 --> 00:42:38.367
the air turned white.

00:42:38.367 --> 00:42:40.367
You couldn't see anything.

00:42:40.367 --> 00:42:41.933
Why was that?

00:42:41.933 --> 00:42:43.933
Well, when the air-- we're going
to talk about this in

00:42:43.933 --> 00:42:46.133
length in the course-- but
when the air expands like

00:42:46.133 --> 00:42:48.867
that, it cools.

00:42:48.867 --> 00:42:53.300
And a cloud formed in our
chamber just like that.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.200
And that happens, by the way,
extremely fast, like in a

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.233
fraction of a second.

00:42:58.233 --> 00:43:00.633
You got a very thick
cloud in there.

00:43:00.633 --> 00:43:02.300
So that was the first
thing I noticed.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.767
Then, this gets a little bit
indelicate, but the next thing

00:43:05.767 --> 00:43:08.900
that happened is we
all began to--

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:15.600
let's use the word outgas for
lack of a better term.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.233
So we kind of leaned over a
little bit in our chairs, and

00:43:19.233 --> 00:43:21.733
we outgassed for a while.

00:43:21.733 --> 00:43:25.200
And then we began
to feel faint.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.733
So what they had us doing is
writing out our name over and

00:43:28.733 --> 00:43:29.767
over again.

00:43:29.767 --> 00:43:32.500
So later on, we could look and
see what we had written.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.933
Of course, you write it the
first few times, it looks OK.

00:43:34.933 --> 00:43:36.167
And then it begins to scrawl.

00:43:36.167 --> 00:43:38.033
And then you lose
consciousness.

00:43:38.033 --> 00:43:41.633
And they bring the
air back up.

00:43:41.633 --> 00:43:43.500
So that's some sense.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:48.000
So I guess the follow-on
question would be--

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.733
related to the first--

00:43:50.733 --> 00:43:59.200
if we suddenly lost all the air
in this room, what would

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.533
kill us first?

00:44:06.533 --> 00:44:09.967
It may be closest to your
answer actually.

00:44:09.967 --> 00:44:11.600
But it won't be exactly that.

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.833
What would kill us first?

00:44:13.833 --> 00:44:14.567
STUDENT: The lung.

00:44:14.567 --> 00:44:15.533
PROFESSOR: The lung?

00:44:15.533 --> 00:44:16.133
Yeah.

00:44:16.133 --> 00:44:20.633
So any scuba divers
in the course?

00:44:20.633 --> 00:44:24.233
What do you worry about when
you've been diving deep and

00:44:24.233 --> 00:44:25.633
you come up suddenly?

00:44:25.633 --> 00:44:27.067
STUDENT: The expansion of gas.

00:44:27.067 --> 00:44:27.833
PROFESSOR: Bends.

00:44:27.833 --> 00:44:29.600
It's called the Bends, right?

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.233
So what happens when you're
scuba diving, you're down at a

00:44:33.233 --> 00:44:36.533
high pressure for a while,
nitrogen dissolves in your

00:44:36.533 --> 00:44:39.533
blood at a higher fraction
than it is normally.

00:44:39.533 --> 00:44:43.767
Then when you suddenly come up,
that gas bubbles out of

00:44:43.767 --> 00:44:46.767
solution, like taking a can of
Coke and shaking it basically.

00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:49.900
The gases come out of solution
forms bubbles.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.633
And of course, then you got
bubbles in your bloodstream.

00:44:52.633 --> 00:44:53.567
So that's the Bends.

00:44:53.567 --> 00:44:54.467
And you can die from that.

00:44:54.467 --> 00:44:57.933
And it's kind of like
having a stroke.

00:44:57.933 --> 00:45:00.467
That would probably be the
thing that would--

00:45:00.467 --> 00:45:03.100
basically, your blood boils.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.700
That's probably the best
way to think of it.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:08.567
You drop the pressure so
suddenly that then the gases

00:45:08.567 --> 00:45:12.367
that are already in your
bloodstream just suddenly

00:45:12.367 --> 00:45:14.900
begin-- it would happen
in an instant.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.000
And you would be in
excruciating pain.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.233
And then you would be dead.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:25.367
So that's probably first.
What would happen next?

00:45:25.367 --> 00:45:25.700
Yeah?

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.500
STUDENT: Is that what happens
when like an astronaut

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.767
depressurizes in space?

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.200
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.800
So an astronaut is in
a pressure suit

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.633
for just this reason.

00:45:36.633 --> 00:45:40.367
And if you were to develop a
leak in that, and he would to

00:45:40.367 --> 00:45:43.967
lose his pressurization, he
would die just like I've

00:45:43.967 --> 00:45:47.233
described, instantly and in
great pain because of the

00:45:47.233 --> 00:45:48.700
blood boiling, basically.

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:52.567
All the dissolved gases coming
out of solution.

00:45:52.567 --> 00:45:54.300
So the pressure-- you mentioned
the pressure--

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.733
the pressure does that for us.

00:45:55.733 --> 00:45:58.133
It keep those gases
in solution.

00:45:58.133 --> 00:46:01.367
And if you suddenly release
it, out they come.

00:46:01.367 --> 00:46:04.133
The breathing was mentioned.

00:46:04.133 --> 00:46:05.100
So we couldn't breathe.

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:09.533
And that would knock
us out after what?

00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:11.800
You could hold your breath
for a minute or so.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:15.467
But then you might become
unconscious after that.

00:46:15.467 --> 00:46:17.067
Some other things would
take a lot longer.

00:46:17.067 --> 00:46:18.333
So they're not really
relevant.

00:46:18.333 --> 00:46:19.033
You're dead.

00:46:19.033 --> 00:46:21.933
But some other things that
would be probably good to

00:46:21.933 --> 00:46:26.467
write down would be the
atmosphere has a great

00:46:26.467 --> 00:46:31.367
moderating influence on our
climate as I'll show later on.

00:46:31.367 --> 00:46:34.300
Were it not for our atmosphere,
the temperature of

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.633
the surface of our earth would
be much, much colder than it

00:46:37.633 --> 00:46:40.967
is, colder than we than
we could survive.

00:46:40.967 --> 00:46:43.667
That's a long- term effect,
but the atmosphere is very

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:44.567
important for that.

00:46:44.567 --> 00:46:50.800
And the atmosphere protects us
also from X-rays, ultraviolet

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.267
radiation, small micro particles
coming into the

00:46:55.267 --> 00:46:55.767
atmosphere.

00:46:55.767 --> 00:46:57.300
They burn up in the
atmosphere.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:02.333
So the atmosphere has a great
protective role to play in

00:47:02.333 --> 00:47:08.200
allowing us to exist
on this planet.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.067
So we're exactly out of time.

00:47:10.067 --> 00:47:13.000
And I'll see you next time.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.233
See you on Friday.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.481
Professor Donald
Kagan: Well,

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:05.902
as we continue with our
investigation of the emergence

00:00:05.902 --> 00:00:07.730
and development of the
polis,

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.732
we come to the
polis--just to use its

00:00:11.732 --> 00:00:14.990
proper name in Greek,
Lacedaemon,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.696
and that is the proper Greek
name for it, but the capital

00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:29.790
city of it was Sparta and its
people were called Spartans.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.980
So, it's okay to keep talking
about Sparta and Spartans.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.262
Now, when you come to Sparta
you are coming to a polis

00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:44.616
that you almost want to spell it
in capital letters with stars

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:48.028
between them.
It's like the polis

00:00:48.028 --> 00:00:52.424
lifted to a new level in the
sense of all the sort of

00:00:52.424 --> 00:00:56.990
theoretical elements and
psychological elements that go

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.231
into creating a polis is
intensified in Sparta to such a

00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:07.219
degree that it seems to be
almost a different thing.

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:12.770
And it's important to remember
that the other Greeks felt that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.302
way too.
Sparta had a special place in

00:01:17.302 --> 00:01:21.799
their minds, in their
imaginations.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.563
They admired the Spartans very,
very much, because the Spartans

00:01:27.563 --> 00:01:32.210
carried to this extreme degree
the feeling that the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.230
polis was the center of a
Greek man's life,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.492
and that it had the virtues
that were associated with the

00:01:42.492 --> 00:01:46.440
polis to an extraordinary
degree.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.111
Now, they admired it very,
very much but they didn't

00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:52.360
admire it so much they were
ready to live like the Spartans,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.690
because the price was very high
indeed.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.783
One other thing to remember
as we take a look at the way the

00:02:00.783 --> 00:02:05.634
Spartans lived was that they
became a sort of a model for the

00:02:05.634 --> 00:02:10.242
philosophers who came along in
the late fifth and into the

00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:14.511
fourth century.
I mean especially Plato and

00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:19.749
Aristotle, who certainly had
some criticisms of the real

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.503
Sparta that existed,
but who modeled their notions

00:02:24.503 --> 00:02:29.896
of ideal poleis on Sparta
with the variations that they

00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:33.691
wished to introduce.
So, it's worthwhile,

00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:38.800
and of course--it's added to
these ideas and feelings about

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.307
the Spartans,
there is the fact that Sparta

00:02:43.307 --> 00:02:49.287
would emerge in the sixth
century as the most powerful of

00:02:49.287 --> 00:02:55.908
the poleis and the first
leader of a lasting alliance of

00:02:55.908 --> 00:03:02.530
states with the Spartans as the
leading power among them,

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.695
the first international
organization you might say if

00:03:05.695 --> 00:03:09.853
you were speaking loosely,
so that there is a practical

00:03:09.853 --> 00:03:13.464
aspect to it.
The Spartans became the most

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:17.126
powerful and most important
state in Greece,

00:03:17.126 --> 00:03:21.300
right down to and including,
the Persian Wars.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.515
Well, first I guess,
we ought to take a look at how

00:03:26.515 --> 00:03:31.923
Sparta got to be what it
ultimately became and once again

00:03:31.923 --> 00:03:37.911
I have to say that all we can do
is to reason from very limited

00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:41.449
evidence,
better than what we've had up

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:45.843
to now, but still mostly from
written evidence that comes from

00:03:45.843 --> 00:03:49.229
a time after the facts we are
talking about,

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:53.874
practically no contemporary
evidence, although we do have a

00:03:53.874 --> 00:03:58.518
bit and the archaeological
remains that we do have and then

00:03:58.518 --> 00:04:01.202
reason from that.
Well, of course,

00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:04.710
that kind of reasoning leads to
controversy and there are

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.530
different opinions about all
these things.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.544
Again, what I will be
attempting to pass on to you is

00:04:11.544 --> 00:04:16.329
the most widely accepted set of
opinions about these things,

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.243
but one cannot be sure that
other evidence might not emerge

00:04:20.243 --> 00:04:23.752
or new ways of seeing things
might change the picture

00:04:23.752 --> 00:04:25.945
somewhat.
As you will see,

00:04:25.945 --> 00:04:30.551
or have seen in your problems
book, on one question there

00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:35.618
really is no consensus,
but again just a majority

00:04:35.618 --> 00:04:42.412
opinion as to the question of
how and when Sparta got to be

00:04:42.412 --> 00:04:47.498
what it was.
So here's the most common

00:04:47.498 --> 00:04:52.690
interpretation I'll be giving
you now.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.572
The story is you come into
the Peloponnesus at the

00:04:56.572 --> 00:05:00.821
beginning of the Dark Ages and
it's before the Dorians have

00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:04.677
taken over,
so that the people inhabiting

00:05:04.677 --> 00:05:10.287
that area are Greeks who are of
the branch of the family who

00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:17.639
speak an Achaean kind of Greek,
meaning the language the Greeks

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.457
spoke in the Mycenaean Period.
But that's not what they're

00:05:23.457 --> 00:05:26.853
doing when we first see them
historically and when they

00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:30.689
emerge in the form of the people
who will make the poIlis.

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.819
By then they are Dorians who
have come into the Peloponnesus

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:39.160
at some point after the fall of
the Mycenaean world and in most

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.544
places,
almost all places,

00:05:41.544 --> 00:05:46.300
have become the dominant people
in the Peloponnesus.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.958
So, when you first see anything
that is Sparta,

00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:56.426
we see Dorians running it,
and we see subordinate Greek

00:05:56.426 --> 00:06:01.490
peoples in different degrees of
subordination,

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.323
who are presumably Achaean
Greeks who have lost out in the

00:06:06.323 --> 00:06:10.139
competition and who are under
the Spartans.

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:15.853
It looks like from a very early
time--you hear about people

00:06:15.853 --> 00:06:21.370
called helots and how to define
a helot is not simple.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.397
Helots in a certain sense
are slaves, but they are not the

00:06:26.397 --> 00:06:31.506
kind of slaves we are accustomed
to think about who belong to a

00:06:31.506 --> 00:06:35.298
particular master.
They are slaves who belong to

00:06:35.298 --> 00:06:39.391
the state, to the polis
as a whole and then to further

00:06:39.391 --> 00:06:43.279
complicate matters when we come
upon them functioning,

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:47.546
although they work and they
belong to the state they are

00:06:47.546 --> 00:06:52.045
assigned to a particular part of
the farmland of the region

00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:56.149
occupied by Sparta,
which is called Laconia.

00:06:56.149 --> 00:07:00.838
They are assigned to that piece
of land, which piece of land,

00:07:00.838 --> 00:07:05.136
will also be assigned to a
particular Spartan citizen so

00:07:05.136 --> 00:07:09.824
de facto the helots are
working the plot that provides

00:07:09.824 --> 00:07:12.950
the food for a particular
Spartan,

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.427
not for the Spartans in general.
So, that's moderately

00:07:16.427 --> 00:07:20.920
complicated, but the helots are
going to be a very critical part

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.486
of the story and of
understanding what makes Sparta

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.774
tick.
Now, there are also,

00:07:26.774 --> 00:07:29.596
from the first time we hear of
the Spartans,

00:07:29.596 --> 00:07:32.089
there are people living in
Laconia,

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:35.171
some of them in the
neighborhood of Sparta,

00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:39.574
but one of their fundamental
defining characteristics is that

00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:42.730
they do not live in the city of
Sparta,

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.377
they are not citizens of
Sparta, they are not what the

00:07:46.377 --> 00:07:49.140
citizens of Sparta are called,
Spartiates.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.241
It looks as though they're
probably Dorians,

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:58.673
although we can't be sure about
that, but it looks as though

00:07:58.673 --> 00:08:02.014
they are.
These people are called

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:08.646
perioikoi and their name
means people who live around

00:08:08.646 --> 00:08:12.713
Sparta,
that means anywhere in the

00:08:12.713 --> 00:08:19.051
territory controlled by the
Spartans, but not in the city

00:08:19.051 --> 00:08:23.240
and as we shall see they are
free.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.350
They are not slaves or serfs or
helots.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:32.932
Each perioikoi,
presumably, has a farm that he

00:08:32.932 --> 00:08:37.754
works for himself.
The perioikoi also are

00:08:37.754 --> 00:08:43.009
engaged in trade such as it is
in Sparta, which is very,

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:48.000
very small relatively speaking
and also in industry again which

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.258
is not a big deal,
but somebody has to be working

00:08:52.258 --> 00:08:56.230
the bronze and the iron and
making the pots,

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.300
and these people would be
perioikoi, because the

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.654
Spartans, when we finally see
them in the developed state of

00:09:02.654 --> 00:09:05.509
Sparta,
won't be doing any of that

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:08.502
stuff.
When Sparta is Sparta,

00:09:08.502 --> 00:09:12.200
the Spartiates do only one
thing.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.610
Well, I guess not,
they do two things;

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.170
they fight and they prepare to
fight.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.920
That's it;
they are soldiers.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.578
They do nothing else.
They have no economic function

00:09:26.578 --> 00:09:31.335
whatsoever.
Now, it wasn't always so,

00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:36.185
there is--well,
before I tell you the story as

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:41.789
we tell it today based on modern
interpretations,

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:46.769
let me tell you what the Greeks
and the Spartans said about it.

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:51.284
They said at one point back
there in those early days,

00:09:51.284 --> 00:09:54.179
there was a man called
Lycurgus,

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:58.719
who brought laws to Sparta and
set up the regime of Sparta as

00:09:58.719 --> 00:10:02.879
we will know it in the sixth and
the fifth centuries.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:05.570
And he did it,
and there's a lot of arguing

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.836
about what his date was,
but if you take the ancient

00:10:08.836 --> 00:10:13.470
Greek sources seriously,
maybe in the ninth century

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:19.370
B.C., this was done and so it
was forever thereafter.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:24.000
Well, not only is this date not
widely believed,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.629
hardly any scholar would take
that seriously,

00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:32.198
and then people do argue about
when would the changes have

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:34.889
taken place, and if there was a
Lycurgus,

00:10:34.889 --> 00:10:38.029
when he would have introduced
these laws.

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:43.965
A skeptic of nineteenth-century
historian put it this way,

00:10:43.965 --> 00:10:49.379
he said, Lycurgus was not a man
he was only a god.

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:52.731
That is to say,
he was somebody invented by the

00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:56.010
Spartans as somebody who put
together this.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.476
I myself--you know me.
I'm credulous by trade and I

00:11:00.476 --> 00:11:04.039
believe in the higher
naiveté.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:07.432
I think there might have been a
guy named Lycurgus,

00:11:07.432 --> 00:11:11.368
and I think there's a pretty
clear--if there was such a man

00:11:11.368 --> 00:11:15.372
he probably proposed some laws
which became important to the

00:11:15.372 --> 00:11:18.215
Spartans.
But I am not so completely

00:11:18.215 --> 00:11:22.148
credulous as to believe the
system was established by one

00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:23.459
man,
way back when,

00:11:23.459 --> 00:11:26.442
and it didn't change,
because there's a good deal of

00:11:26.442 --> 00:11:30.186
evidence to suggest the contrary
that there are developments that

00:11:30.186 --> 00:11:33.580
happened that make Sparta what
it will be ultimately.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.239
The first sort of
historical event that we know

00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:41.557
about, and we think we know
about Sparta was towards the end

00:11:41.557 --> 00:11:47.980
of the eighth century,
perhaps in the years between

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.556
725 and 700.
There was a war in which the

00:11:52.556 --> 00:11:56.978
Spartans conquered the
neighboring territory to the

00:11:56.978 --> 00:12:00.870
west of Laconia,
which is called Mycenae.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.102
I hope you're becoming familiar;
I hope you're looking at maps a

00:12:04.102 --> 00:12:07.158
lot and becoming familiar with
the geography of Greece and the

00:12:07.158 --> 00:12:09.808
Peloponnesus.
You can notice to the west

00:12:09.808 --> 00:12:14.216
there is a kind of a promontory
that comes out and it's on that

00:12:14.216 --> 00:12:18.127
extreme western side of the
Peloponnesus that Mycenae is

00:12:18.127 --> 00:12:22.179
located and it looks like it's
right next to Sparta,

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:25.535
and it is, but there's an
important thing that you have to

00:12:25.535 --> 00:12:28.852
be aware of.
There's a mountain range that

00:12:28.852 --> 00:12:33.838
separates Sparta from Mycenae,
the Taygetus range and it is

00:12:33.838 --> 00:12:36.905
striking.
If you go to Sparta and come up

00:12:36.905 --> 00:12:41.240
from the Spartan port of Gythium
and head up for the town itself,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.371
pretty soon if you look to your
left there is this really

00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:50.240
serious range of mountains that
makes it clear it was a barrier;

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.789
it was not something that you
could just think away.

00:12:54.789 --> 00:12:56.440
It meant they were very
separated.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.063
So, if a Spartan wants go to
Mycenae he doesn't just head

00:13:00.063 --> 00:13:03.493
west, he has to go north and
then hang a left when the

00:13:03.493 --> 00:13:07.570
mountains have stopped and go
around and come on back down.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.785
That's going to be a very
important part of the story of

00:13:10.785 --> 00:13:14.352
why Sparta is the way it is.
But the conquest of Mycenae

00:13:14.352 --> 00:13:16.982
in the first Mycenaean War,
as this is called,

00:13:16.982 --> 00:13:20.596
is very important,
because now the Spartans

00:13:20.596 --> 00:13:26.165
conquer a very large number of
people whom they turn into

00:13:26.165 --> 00:13:28.876
helots.
These are not just like all the

00:13:28.876 --> 00:13:31.257
other people that were living
around Sparta,

00:13:31.257 --> 00:13:34.690
who the Spartans happened to
make helots at an early stage;

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.307
this is a whole people with a
sense of themselves,

00:13:38.307 --> 00:13:41.259
who think of themselves as
Mycenaeans.

00:13:41.259 --> 00:13:45.404
They are conquered and enslaved
and they become a critical part

00:13:45.404 --> 00:13:49.347
of the Spartan population from
the standpoint of the Spartan

00:13:49.347 --> 00:13:52.839
economy,
essential for the kind of state

00:13:52.839 --> 00:13:56.222
Sparta becomes,
and they are permanently

00:13:56.222 --> 00:13:59.751
dissatisfied.
They are permanently angry,

00:13:59.751 --> 00:14:04.430
they are permanently thinking
about somehow getting free and

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:08.035
permanently,
therefore, presenting a threat

00:14:08.035 --> 00:14:11.820
to whatever the Spartan regime
is at the time.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.690
So, that's a very,
very important development.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:22.127
Now, probably before that
happened, the Spartans like some

00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:26.138
of the other states,
send out colonies,

00:14:26.138 --> 00:14:29.966
only two.
One of them is out west in the

00:14:29.966 --> 00:14:35.042
southern Italy at a place called
Taras, that town becomes under

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:42.019
the Romans becomes Tarentum.
It's Taranto in modern Italy.

00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:47.754
And in the Aegean Sea the
Island of Melos is colonized by

00:14:47.754 --> 00:14:51.400
the Spartans.
And so my guess is they did

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.091
that as a way of handling that
population growth problem that

00:14:56.091 --> 00:15:00.704
was beginning to be felt around
Greece before they conquered

00:15:00.704 --> 00:15:04.769
Mycenae and that settled their
problem forever.

00:15:04.769 --> 00:15:07.950
Thereafter, they didn't need
anymore land;

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.516
they had all the land they
needed to feed themselves and

00:15:12.516 --> 00:15:17.082
take care of what they needed,
and to be farmed by these

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:20.469
captive helots.
Yet, if we imagine

00:15:20.469 --> 00:15:25.570
ourselves let's say for the sake
of argument in the year 675,

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:29.460
it looks as though Sparta has
certainly not yet become the

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.350
kind of place we will see in its
fully developed state.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.591
For instance,
it is still engaging in the

00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:41.292
kinds of cultural activities
that are characteristic of the

00:15:41.292 --> 00:15:44.815
other states,
which will not be true when we

00:15:44.815 --> 00:15:49.713
get to the Classical Period.
Two striking examples are in

00:15:49.713 --> 00:15:55.360
the area of pottery where we
find Spartan made pottery,

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.607
painted pottery of the same
kind of quality,

00:15:58.607 --> 00:16:02.911
but of its own unique style,
as we find in the other Greek

00:16:02.911 --> 00:16:05.810
city states.
When you get to the late sixth

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.120
and into the fifth century,
that's over.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.769
There isn't like that anymore,
and so that's a change.

00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:16.034
But the other thing that's
striking is that in the period

00:16:16.034 --> 00:16:19.233
before the final,
or I should say the major

00:16:19.233 --> 00:16:23.407
change in Spartan life,
we discover poets,

00:16:23.407 --> 00:16:27.289
fragments of whose poems
remain.

00:16:27.289 --> 00:16:31.180
There are two famous Spartan
poets of this early period,

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.859
Terpander and Alcman,
and they wrote beautiful poetry

00:16:34.859 --> 00:16:37.759
of the same kind as the other
Greeks.

00:16:37.759 --> 00:16:43.345
That will stop by the time we
get to the period we're talking

00:16:43.345 --> 00:16:45.929
about.
So, the next great

00:16:45.929 --> 00:16:50.612
historical event that makes a
difference in Sparta is the

00:16:50.612 --> 00:16:54.851
second Mycenaean War,
which occurs in the years,

00:16:54.851 --> 00:16:59.056
of course these are
approximate, somewhere between

00:16:59.056 --> 00:17:02.827
650 and 625 this happens.
Notice in each case,

00:17:02.827 --> 00:17:06.381
first and second war,
our guess is a whole quarter of

00:17:06.381 --> 00:17:09.515
a century of fighting;
that's very important to

00:17:09.515 --> 00:17:11.904
realize.
These were not your typical

00:17:11.904 --> 00:17:15.390
Greek war of later years.
This was not one day we'd have

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.385
a battle and we'd go home.
This was a campaign that lasted

00:17:19.385 --> 00:17:22.408
a generation,
that's how hard it was to

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:25.446
conquer Mycenae,
and then in the second

00:17:25.446 --> 00:17:28.570
Mycenaean War,
how hard it was to put down the

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.971
tremendous rebellion that
brought about the second

00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:36.269
Mycenaean War.
It was a helot rebellion.

00:17:36.269 --> 00:17:40.275
The helots could not have
succeeded in making this such a

00:17:40.275 --> 00:17:43.923
hard fight had they not been
assisted by some of the

00:17:43.923 --> 00:17:47.701
neighbors of Sparta.
Argos, you will remember,

00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:52.155
from the time of Pheidon,
they have been an enemy and a

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:57.065
competitor of the Spartans,
and so the Argives are quick to

00:17:57.065 --> 00:18:01.779
join and help the helots in
their rebellion against Sparta,

00:18:01.779 --> 00:18:05.829
but so too do a number of
cities to the north of Sparta,

00:18:05.829 --> 00:18:10.779
from the region called Arcadia,
also join in with the helots

00:18:10.779 --> 00:18:15.099
and even so far as the
northwestern corner of the

00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:19.596
Peloponnesus,
a town called Pisa near Olympia

00:18:19.596 --> 00:18:24.230
also joins the coalition against
the Spartans.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:28.275
So you can imagine that the
Spartans push forward created

00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:31.960
opposition and the helots took
advantage of that,

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.640
and joined with the other
states to put Sparta in danger.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.109
The ancient tradition says
the Spartans really were in

00:18:40.109 --> 00:18:42.299
terrible danger and it was a
very,

00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:46.022
very hard fight and what
happened was going to turn out

00:18:46.022 --> 00:18:49.865
to be the first of a pattern.
When the helots were defeated

00:18:49.865 --> 00:18:53.099
in battle they didn't quit,
they didn't stop fighting,

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:58.563
they retreated to the safest
place they could find and there

00:18:58.563 --> 00:19:04.304
in Mycenae there is very rugged
mountain called Ithome which is

00:19:04.304 --> 00:19:10.231
a kind of a natural fortress and
which the helots fortified still

00:19:10.231 --> 00:19:13.701
more.
So, they could stay up there on

00:19:13.701 --> 00:19:18.367
that mountain and fight off
Spartan attacks for quite a long

00:19:18.367 --> 00:19:20.706
time.
Remember, the Spartans are

00:19:20.706 --> 00:19:24.709
hampered in this war by having
to cope with neighboring cities

00:19:24.709 --> 00:19:28.660
battling them as well.
By the time that is over,

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.743
you move towards the ultimate
arrangement of life in the

00:19:33.743 --> 00:19:37.070
Sparta that we will come to
know.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:45.200
One set of scholars,
they probably are as numerous

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.793
as any, would suggest that it's
only after the second Mycenaean

00:19:50.793 --> 00:19:54.761
War that the Spartan
constitution that I will

00:19:54.761 --> 00:19:58.369
describe for you comes into
being.

00:19:58.369 --> 00:20:01.707
Probably we shouldn't even
imagine that it was all the laws

00:20:01.707 --> 00:20:03.663
were laid out,
all the customs were

00:20:03.663 --> 00:20:07.482
established in one fell swoop,
but rather that there was a

00:20:07.482 --> 00:20:11.276
basic set of things that was
laid out and then over time

00:20:11.276 --> 00:20:15.071
other changes were made that
produced what we're talking

00:20:15.071 --> 00:20:18.079
about.
So, that's why I think we can't

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:20.910
accept the traditional Lycurgus
story;

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.653
that he came down,
set up the laws,

00:20:23.653 --> 00:20:28.253
even if we do accept that
Lycurgus who was a kind of a law

00:20:28.253 --> 00:20:31.019
giver.
Now, before I describe it in

00:20:31.019 --> 00:20:34.519
detail, let me make a general
statement about it.

00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:39.166
What is established in this
constitutional ultimate reform

00:20:39.166 --> 00:20:43.660
is to make Sparta like no other
state in the Greek world,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.233
and then perhaps--well,
like hardly any other state in

00:20:47.233 --> 00:20:50.199
all of history,
and to make it the subject of

00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:54.146
attention and interest,
and of usual admiration,

00:20:54.146 --> 00:20:58.309
although not always,
throughout the millennia.

00:20:58.309 --> 00:21:01.216
You will find when people know
about the Greeks and they know

00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:03.300
about Sparta,
I'm talking about of course in

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:03.930
the West,

00:21:07.009 --> 00:21:10.073
philosophers and others are
struck just as Plato and

00:21:10.073 --> 00:21:13.736
Aristotle were by certain things
about the Spartan way of life

00:21:13.736 --> 00:21:16.799
that make them take it seriously
and admire it.

00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:24.000
Rousseau was a great admirer of
Sparta for a variety of reasons.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.104
But one of the things that I
don't want you to lose sight of

00:21:29.104 --> 00:21:34.035
is that Sparta becomes a slave
holding state like no other

00:21:34.035 --> 00:21:38.135
Greek state.
Now, there was slavery all over

00:21:38.135 --> 00:21:41.709
the ancient world.
There was no society that we

00:21:41.709 --> 00:21:45.528
know of in the ancient world
that was without slavery and

00:21:45.528 --> 00:21:49.596
Greece was no different,
but in the period we're talking

00:21:49.596 --> 00:21:54.049
about there were not very many
slaves among the Greek states as

00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:56.442
a whole,
and there was certainly nothing

00:21:56.442 --> 00:22:01.188
like what the Spartans did.
To have a system of life that

00:22:01.188 --> 00:22:07.900
allowed the Spartan citizens not
to work in order to live;

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.880
no other Greek state would have
that.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.378
If you want to think about
Greek slavery in the seventh

00:22:13.378 --> 00:22:15.970
century B.C.,
think about what I told you

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.468
about Hanson's reconstruction of
the development of the

00:22:19.468 --> 00:22:22.480
polis.
Think about farmers who

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.048
themselves worked the fields,
and are assisted in their work

00:22:27.048 --> 00:22:31.230
in the fields by one or two
slaves that they owned.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:34.966
That's not the Spartan system.
The Spartan system will be

00:22:34.966 --> 00:22:38.120
Spartans at home,
training constantly for their

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.565
military purposes,
never working any fields,

00:22:41.565 --> 00:22:46.138
never engaging in trade or
industry, others doing that for

00:22:46.138 --> 00:22:49.406
them.
Something that in a small way

00:22:49.406 --> 00:22:54.932
begins to resemble slavery as we
think of it in the antebellum

00:22:54.932 --> 00:23:00.126
south in the United States,
where great armies of slaves

00:23:00.126 --> 00:23:05.079
are doing all the work and where
the plantation owners,

00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:10.558
the Spartans don't do any work
at all, but in the south to

00:23:10.558 --> 00:23:16.710
maintain the kind of a military
aristocracy of a certain kind.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.486
Please don't push that analogy
too far and I hope I haven't

00:23:20.486 --> 00:23:24.623
misled you by suggesting it.
But why I do is because it may

00:23:24.623 --> 00:23:28.480
help us understand the Spartans
a little bit better.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.195
I remember my old colleague who
taught history of American

00:23:33.195 --> 00:23:36.423
slavery and so on,
John Blassingame,

00:23:36.423 --> 00:23:41.329
said to me at one point,
he said when the emancipation

00:23:41.329 --> 00:23:44.794
came,
the slaves were freed and so

00:23:44.794 --> 00:23:50.437
were the masters and I think
that's a very perceptive thing

00:23:50.437 --> 00:23:53.064
to say.
They were sitting on a powder

00:23:53.064 --> 00:23:55.289
keg, those southern plantation
owners.

00:23:55.289 --> 00:23:58.230
They were in terror
constantly that if everything

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:01.452
didn't go just right something
like Nat Turner's rebellion

00:24:01.452 --> 00:24:03.814
would take place,
and they'd come home and find

00:24:03.814 --> 00:24:05.799
their wives and children with
their throats cut.

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:09.334
They were in constant terror
and they had to live a life that

00:24:09.334 --> 00:24:12.750
required all sorts of things
that they might not have liked

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:15.097
to do,
in order to repress the slave

00:24:15.097 --> 00:24:18.611
population on which they relied,
and that is what I want to

00:24:18.611 --> 00:24:21.079
communicate.
The Spartans,

00:24:21.079 --> 00:24:27.440
after the two Mycenaean Wars,
were in constant fear.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.522
I think it's not too strong a
word of helot rebellions,

00:24:31.522 --> 00:24:35.982
which might then be assisted by
neighboring states that were

00:24:35.982 --> 00:24:38.779
jealous or disliked the
Spartans.

00:24:38.779 --> 00:24:43.567
Thucydides says flat out that,
that's what the spring is to

00:24:43.567 --> 00:24:47.611
understanding Spartan policy and
Spartan thinking,

00:24:47.611 --> 00:24:51.661
it is their fear of the helots.
Most scholars would have

00:24:51.661 --> 00:24:55.161
accepted that without question;
lately, some scholars have come

00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:58.771
up and wanted to question it.
I must say I'm not at all

00:24:58.771 --> 00:25:01.319
persuaded by the new
interpretation.

00:25:01.319 --> 00:25:06.450
I do think to understand the
Spartans we have to comprehend

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:11.049
the continuing permanent concern
about the helots,

00:25:11.049 --> 00:25:15.214
as we'll make clear as we talk
about some of the details of

00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:18.234
their lives.
All right, let's take a look

00:25:18.234 --> 00:25:21.904
now at the way the Spartan
constitution looked fully

00:25:21.904 --> 00:25:22.840
developed.

00:25:26.009 --> 00:25:33.059
We begin with the training
and education of the young;

00:25:33.059 --> 00:25:36.971
the treatment of the young
indeed from the time that they

00:25:36.971 --> 00:25:41.522
are born.
The Spartans and the Greeks

00:25:41.522 --> 00:25:48.668
referred to this system of
training and education as

00:25:48.668 --> 00:25:52.073
agoge.
To begin with,

00:25:52.073 --> 00:25:55.150
a Spartan--let's start with the
men.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:26:00.948
A Spartan boy is born.
Already from the very beginning

00:26:00.948 --> 00:26:05.860
this is not merely a matter that
concerns his family,

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:11.612
his father and his mother.
The decision as to whether or

00:26:11.612 --> 00:26:17.843
not he should be allowed to live
is made by the elders of the

00:26:17.843 --> 00:26:22.310
Spartan community who examine
the child.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.980
What are they examining him for?
Mainly, almost entirely,

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:30.041
for his physical condition.
If he is crippled,

00:26:30.041 --> 00:26:34.694
if he is deformed in any way,
they will have him put to

00:26:34.694 --> 00:26:37.454
death.
The child, the infant,

00:26:37.454 --> 00:26:42.307
brand new baby will be killed.
The reason for that was that

00:26:42.307 --> 00:26:46.921
they had a clue about eugenics.
They understood that healthy

00:26:46.921 --> 00:26:51.929
children grow up to be healthy
adults, who grow up typically to

00:26:51.929 --> 00:26:55.160
have healthy children and vice
versa.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.714
They could not afford,
was their thinking,

00:26:58.714 --> 00:27:03.059
to have men grow up who would
not make good soldiers,

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:07.452
because that's what
Spartans--and worst of all who

00:27:07.452 --> 00:27:13.099
would then sire boys who were
not good material for soldiers.

00:27:13.099 --> 00:27:16.097
So, there you see already
something that was totally

00:27:16.097 --> 00:27:18.390
different from any other Greek
state.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:22.430
It's not that other Greeks did
not engage in infanticide;

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.911
they clearly did,
but that decision was made by

00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:30.680
each family and it was usually
made by poor families--I mean,

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.182
the bad decision to kill a
child was made by poor families

00:27:34.182 --> 00:27:37.440
who just simply couldn't afford
to raise the child.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.150
But in any case,
it was as it would be,

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:44.430
in almost any society you ever
heard of a family decision.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.937
Not in Sparta,
it was a state decision as to

00:27:47.937 --> 00:27:51.630
whether you should live or not.
Well now,

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:55.556
suppose the child made it
through that first ordeal,

00:27:55.556 --> 00:27:59.559
now he has six years of more or
less normal life.

00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:03.025
He lives at home like any other
little boy with his mother

00:28:03.025 --> 00:28:06.490
mostly, and with his father I
suppose too, not so much.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.079
You'll see why I say not so
much in a bit.

00:28:09.079 --> 00:28:15.414
Finally, at the age of seven,
he is taken away from home,

00:28:15.414 --> 00:28:21.069
put into a word in Greek that
really means pack,

00:28:21.069 --> 00:28:24.330
just like the--don't the Cub
Scouts call them,

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.849
their little groups packs?
Is that right?

00:28:27.849 --> 00:28:33.201
So, there they are and they're
taken away from home and they

00:28:33.201 --> 00:28:38.281
live in a military school,
which is the only school there

00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:43.750
is for boys in Sparta.
The school is governed by a

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:48.819
magistrate and it is run by the
older boys.

00:28:48.819 --> 00:28:51.380
In many respects,
when I think about it,

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.319
it strikes me as being like an
upper class British--what they

00:28:55.319 --> 00:28:59.526
call public school,
which means of course private

00:28:59.526 --> 00:29:03.170
school.
The descriptions of Eton and

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:08.349
Harrow, and even more harrowing
places than that;

00:29:08.349 --> 00:29:12.507
surely, you must have read
novels by Englishmen talking

00:29:12.507 --> 00:29:16.896
about their school days and each
one sounds like a torture

00:29:16.896 --> 00:29:19.366
chamber.
Well, that's what we've got

00:29:19.366 --> 00:29:22.275
here.
But the worst part about

00:29:22.275 --> 00:29:27.589
those schools so far as I could
tell were the other boys.

00:29:27.589 --> 00:29:31.518
Because they were allowed,
the older boys were allowed to

00:29:31.518 --> 00:29:35.587
deal with younger boys the way
older boys deal with younger

00:29:35.587 --> 00:29:37.823
boys, badly.
They are bullies,

00:29:37.823 --> 00:29:40.640
they push them around,
they mistreat them;

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.170
it's tough to grow up in a
place like that.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.299
That was what they were up to;
tough is one of the critical

00:29:48.299 --> 00:29:51.576
words that you need to
understand if you're thinking

00:29:51.576 --> 00:29:55.642
about a Spartan education.
But they made it now to the age

00:29:55.642 --> 00:29:59.551
of 12, they live in these
barracks, they have a communal

00:29:59.551 --> 00:30:01.963
life,
they have nothing resembling

00:30:01.963 --> 00:30:05.782
luxuries available to them--more
and more it sounds like an

00:30:05.782 --> 00:30:09.140
English public school of the
nineteenth century.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:16.609
They don't have shoes,
they are given one cloak.

00:30:16.609 --> 00:30:19.629
Now, whatever you may think
about the sunny Mediterranean

00:30:19.629 --> 00:30:22.013
and Greece;
go to Sparta in the middle of

00:30:22.013 --> 00:30:24.165
the winter.
It's damn cold,

00:30:24.165 --> 00:30:29.599
so that one cloak isn't enough,
and that's intentional.

00:30:29.599 --> 00:30:34.329
The idea is for them to learn
how to bear cold.

00:30:34.329 --> 00:30:37.995
They are fed enough,
of course, to keep them healthy

00:30:37.995 --> 00:30:42.019
and going, but no more,
not to satisfy their appetite.

00:30:42.019 --> 00:30:45.477
This is meant to make them,
first of all,

00:30:45.477 --> 00:30:50.577
to make them lean and tough but
also to accustom them to the

00:30:50.577 --> 00:30:55.849
hardships of a campaign and
basically to make them tough.

00:30:55.849 --> 00:31:01.291
They, therefore,
are constantly on the hunt for

00:31:01.291 --> 00:31:08.625
food and the funny thing is that
the ethos of the situation was

00:31:08.625 --> 00:31:12.442
this,
that it was understood they

00:31:12.442 --> 00:31:16.519
would try to steal whatever they
could.

00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:19.640
It's hard for me to know where
they would find things to steal

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.250
and how to steal it,
but kids are very ingenious.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:25.692
So, anyway they would be
encouraged to do that but they

00:31:25.692 --> 00:31:28.599
would be punished severely if
they were caught.

00:31:28.599 --> 00:31:32.180
So the trick was to steal but
not to get caught;

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.809
that was also part of the
training.

00:31:34.809 --> 00:31:40.274
But I always thought that some
wonderful focus of what it was

00:31:40.274 --> 00:31:45.921
like to be a kid in one of those
Spartan schools is revealed by

00:31:45.921 --> 00:31:51.386
the story that Plutarch tells
and it doesn't really matter if

00:31:51.386 --> 00:31:57.468
the story is true or not,
because it tells something real

00:31:57.468 --> 00:32:01.808
in the telling.
The story is that one Spartan

00:32:01.808 --> 00:32:07.584
boy had succeeded in hunting an
animal that he could eat and the

00:32:07.584 --> 00:32:12.599
animal he caught was a ferret,
and he would have killed it and

00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:16.705
eaten it, except that at just at
that point the call was for them

00:32:16.705 --> 00:32:20.427
to get into formation and so he
had to immediately get into

00:32:20.427 --> 00:32:22.790
formation,
it would have been deadly not

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.737
to do that, but he didn't want
to lose the ferret so he tucked

00:32:25.737 --> 00:32:27.822
it under his cloak.
So there he is,

00:32:27.822 --> 00:32:31.232
standing with the other boys at
complete attention,

00:32:31.232 --> 00:32:34.846
meanwhile, the ferret is
gradually eating his way into

00:32:34.846 --> 00:32:38.026
the boy's side.
Naturally, he doesn't even

00:32:38.026 --> 00:32:42.217
blink, because if he lets on
that he did he would be severely

00:32:42.217 --> 00:32:45.640
punished for being caught
stealing the ferret.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.661
So finally, the ferret finds
its way to a vital organ,

00:32:49.661 --> 00:32:54.137
and the boy without saying a
word, drops dead right there in

00:32:54.137 --> 00:32:56.554
the ranks.
Now, of course,

00:32:56.554 --> 00:33:00.690
the point of that story is to
show how brave the boys were,

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:04.611
and how tough they were and how
rigorous was the Spartan

00:33:04.611 --> 00:33:08.668
training.
I was always struck by how

00:33:08.668 --> 00:33:14.550
hungry do you have to be to want
to eat a ferret?

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:18.150
But however you see the story;
you see what the message is.

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:22.581
It might be exaggerated and all
that, but that's the picture

00:33:22.581 --> 00:33:27.446
that comes out of Sparta.
Now, they are also in addition

00:33:27.446 --> 00:33:32.034
given physical training.
They're already beginning to

00:33:32.034 --> 00:33:35.292
get physical training,
the use of weapons,

00:33:35.292 --> 00:33:38.980
formations and so on,
but at the same time they are

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.357
taught what the Greeks called,
I think I mentioned in an

00:33:42.357 --> 00:33:45.920
earlier talk,
musikae, music.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:50.799
What we call--the translation
is music, but it means poetry.

00:33:50.799 --> 00:33:54.908
It means poems that are
accompanied by musical

00:33:54.908 --> 00:33:59.473
instruments and sung,
but the words are what matter

00:33:59.473 --> 00:34:05.058
more than anything else.
The kind of things that they

00:34:05.058 --> 00:34:11.438
are taught are moral lessons
that are meant to be the things

00:34:11.438 --> 00:34:15.495
that they live by,
that they are raised by,

00:34:15.495 --> 00:34:20.108
and in a few moments I'll read
to you an example of the kind of

00:34:20.108 --> 00:34:23.679
thing that was part of that
musical training;

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.431
of course, gymnastics and
military training I mentioned

00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:29.312
before.
The boys until the age of

00:34:29.312 --> 00:34:33.823
20 are trained by older boys,
or I should say young men

00:34:33.823 --> 00:34:39.305
between the ages of 20 and 30.
So this educational element

00:34:39.305 --> 00:34:45.261
will consist of boys from the
age of seven to men at the age

00:34:45.261 --> 00:34:48.153
of 30,
but the guys between 20 and 30

00:34:48.153 --> 00:34:51.592
will be the teachers,
and the boys below them will be

00:34:51.592 --> 00:34:55.283
their pupils.
Now, other elements involved in

00:34:55.283 --> 00:34:59.021
this picture,
there was as you always find in

00:34:59.021 --> 00:35:02.590
systems where boys are packed
together,

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:06.467
and there are older and younger
boys, hazing is part of this

00:35:06.467 --> 00:35:10.475
game, all part of the business
of being tough and manly and so

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:14.007
on and so forth.
But for the Spartans,

00:35:14.007 --> 00:35:17.447
that wasn't enough.
As we will see,

00:35:17.447 --> 00:35:21.872
what they are shooting for is
not merely developing

00:35:21.872 --> 00:35:26.739
individuals who have the
qualities that are desired.

00:35:26.739 --> 00:35:30.633
They are interested in
developing people,

00:35:30.633 --> 00:35:36.278
young men who are so closely
intertwined with each other as

00:35:36.278 --> 00:35:40.020
to be tighter,
even I would argue,

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:44.734
than a family,
and one aspect of this was very

00:35:44.734 --> 00:35:49.747
clearly sexual.
The typical arrangement was

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:55.699
a young teenage boy would be
associated with an older man,

00:35:55.699 --> 00:35:59.031
but could be one of the men
between the ages of 20 and 30,

00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:02.067
it could be an older man,
and they had a formal

00:36:02.067 --> 00:36:05.253
arrangement.
The older man was what the

00:36:05.253 --> 00:36:10.349
Greeks called an erotes,
a lover and the boy was the

00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:14.389
eromenos and that means
the beloved.

00:36:14.389 --> 00:36:18.443
Xenophon who is an Athenian but
who spent a good deal of his

00:36:18.443 --> 00:36:22.360
life in Sparta and knew the
Spartans very well is very,

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.537
very eager to tell us that
there was no physical side to

00:36:26.537 --> 00:36:29.955
this association,
that it was purely spiritual

00:36:29.955 --> 00:36:33.070
and it was between teacher and
pupil,

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:39.310
between mentor and the boy that
he provides mentorship for,

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:42.059
but that's all.
Forget it.

00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:45.670
I mean, these were very much
homosexual relationships.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:51.654
But the extraordinary thing to
remember is this was a phase,

00:36:51.654 --> 00:36:55.205
a passing phase,
that is this relationship

00:36:55.205 --> 00:36:58.312
started when one was a boy,
and one was a man,

00:36:58.312 --> 00:37:01.349
and when the boy reached
manhood himself,

00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:05.911
then he was no longer in that
relationship and he himself

00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:09.820
could become an erotes
and find himself an

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.613
eromenos,
although it would be surprising

00:37:13.613 --> 00:37:17.522
if he didn't continue to have a
very close friendship and

00:37:17.522 --> 00:37:22.060
association with the older man
who had been his erotes.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:26.243
This is the other thing.
Every Spartan went on,

00:37:26.243 --> 00:37:31.564
thereafter, I'll come to it in
a minute, was married and was

00:37:31.564 --> 00:37:36.499
supposed to produce children,
most desirably male children

00:37:36.499 --> 00:37:39.280
who would serve as soldiers for
them.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:45.159
So, we should think of this as
being all part of a state system

00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:50.090
of training and education to
produce fighting men,

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:54.834
who would also be practically
all a single family,

00:37:54.834 --> 00:38:00.159
as close and tight with one
another as they could be,

00:38:00.159 --> 00:38:06.165
because of the quality it would
give to the Spartan phalanx made

00:38:06.165 --> 00:38:07.500
up such men.

00:38:12.739 --> 00:38:16.628
I was going to say the Spartan
man when he reaches 20,

00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:20.809
the guys that were there
between the ages of 20 and 30,

00:38:20.809 --> 00:38:26.690
are allowed to marry,
but they are not allowed to

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:31.825
live with their wives.
They continue to live in the

00:38:31.825 --> 00:38:35.710
barracks.
Talk about strange and peculiar

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:38.657
arrangements.
On the other hand,

00:38:38.657 --> 00:38:43.556
of course, they had a natural
desire to visit their wives,

00:38:43.556 --> 00:38:47.510
which they could do if they
weren't caught.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:51.489
So, you had to sneak away to be
with your wife,

00:38:51.489 --> 00:38:55.210
but if you were caught you were
punished.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:39:01.645
Now, what's that all about?
Well, it shows you one of the

00:39:01.645 --> 00:39:06.889
main--many conflicts that exist
in the Spartan system.

00:39:06.889 --> 00:39:10.111
On the one hand,
you have to do that because you

00:39:10.111 --> 00:39:13.949
need children to perpetuate
Spartans, but also to provide

00:39:13.949 --> 00:39:16.405
soldiers.
So, you have to have that much

00:39:16.405 --> 00:39:19.021
normality in the system.
On the other hand,

00:39:19.021 --> 00:39:23.247
you want to resist as much as
you can, building a family in

00:39:23.247 --> 00:39:27.545
the traditional sense because
loyalty to the family might be

00:39:27.545 --> 00:39:31.480
in conflict with the loyalty to
the polis.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:36.130
The polis wins that
argument, because the separation

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.399
takes place.
I don't know whether the

00:39:38.399 --> 00:39:41.447
Spartans understood this or not,
but it seems to me there's a

00:39:41.447 --> 00:39:44.393
psychological element in here
that might even have physical

00:39:44.393 --> 00:39:47.645
consequences for all I know.
I'm thinking about,

00:39:47.645 --> 00:39:52.702
imagine what it was like when a
wife and a young husband and a

00:39:52.702 --> 00:39:56.349
wife actually got together all
that time.

00:39:56.349 --> 00:40:02.377
I mean, there's an argument for
quality as being at the opposite

00:40:02.377 --> 00:40:04.500
end of quantity.
Never mind.

00:40:09.409 --> 00:40:12.086
In any case,
those are some of the strange

00:40:12.086 --> 00:40:15.807
arrangements that were--now,
when the man gets to be 30 he

00:40:15.807 --> 00:40:18.679
stops being an instructor in the
school.

00:40:18.679 --> 00:40:22.076
Now he has his own home,
he lives at home with his wife,

00:40:22.076 --> 00:40:25.719
and if he has young children
below seven they'd be there,

00:40:25.719 --> 00:40:32.282
and the situation looks more
normal, except that these

00:40:32.282 --> 00:40:37.360
Spartan men did not eat dinner
at home.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.085
They had their meals
together at a common mess,

00:40:42.085 --> 00:40:46.809
each one of which was called a
syssition,

00:40:46.809 --> 00:40:50.287
that words means having food,
having grain,

00:40:50.287 --> 00:40:55.503
having bread together and there
were 15 men to each one of these

00:40:55.503 --> 00:40:58.751
syssitia,
this mess, and they ate

00:40:58.751 --> 00:41:02.557
together, had their meals
together for the rest of their

00:41:02.557 --> 00:41:04.175
lives.
There again,

00:41:04.175 --> 00:41:08.239
you have a sense of tremendous
community building,

00:41:08.239 --> 00:41:10.670
unit building.
What is that?

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:14.930
About the size of a platoon
isn't it, or is it a squad?

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:18.296
The size of a squad.
Everything in this thing is

00:41:18.296 --> 00:41:20.994
military.
Now, think about the kind of a

00:41:20.994 --> 00:41:24.981
loyalty to one another,
which we have learned and is so

00:41:24.981 --> 00:41:29.336
critical to success in warfare
that came from people who had

00:41:29.336 --> 00:41:32.880
come through that system and
were fighting,

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.418
as they did,
right next to the guys that

00:41:36.418 --> 00:41:40.780
they saw everyday at meals.
So, that was part of that game.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:45.924
So, even when there are grown
men and living at home,

00:41:45.924 --> 00:41:51.069
they are still maintaining
their close quasi familial

00:41:51.069 --> 00:41:55.719
association with their fellow
fighting men.

00:41:55.719 --> 00:41:59.380
What are the qualities that
are supposed to be produced by

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:04.099
this system?
Discipline, first and foremost.

00:42:04.099 --> 00:42:07.358
Every aspect of your life is
governed by the laws and the

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:10.510
customs of the community.
You better conform;

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:13.678
there is nothing else for you.
Self reliance,

00:42:13.678 --> 00:42:16.396
strangely enough,
because all of these

00:42:16.396 --> 00:42:20.290
encouragements to theft and
discouragements to getting

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:24.698
caught have to do with building
the ability to do things like

00:42:24.698 --> 00:42:26.809
that.
Social cohesion.

00:42:26.809 --> 00:42:31.418
Who can imagine a system more
constructed to bring about such

00:42:31.418 --> 00:42:33.987
a goal?
Loyalty to one another,

00:42:33.987 --> 00:42:38.885
whatever group we're talking
about, but of course beyond that

00:42:38.885 --> 00:42:43.293
loyalty to the community at
large is implicit in all of

00:42:43.293 --> 00:42:47.020
that.
Obedience to your superiors.

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:55.881
Physical and moral endurance.
Courage, and another quality

00:42:55.881 --> 00:42:59.737
that is important,
and again, something that

00:42:59.737 --> 00:43:03.325
appealed very powerfully to
other Greeks,

00:43:03.325 --> 00:43:06.620
uniformity.
You are all just like one

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:10.639
another, you go through exactly
the same experiences;

00:43:10.639 --> 00:43:13.409
there's no distinction among
you.

00:43:13.409 --> 00:43:16.840
On the other hand,
and this is another one of the

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.139
interesting contradictions about
Spartan system.

00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:27.405
Every one of those boys and the
young men, and the older men is

00:43:27.405 --> 00:43:32.817
in competition for honor.
Every one of them wants to be

00:43:32.817 --> 00:43:35.531
recognized by himself,
by his peers,

00:43:35.531 --> 00:43:40.027
and by his superiors as having
been better than the others,

00:43:40.027 --> 00:43:44.820
the best, if possible.
All of them in this situation

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.987
of being friends,
being associates,

00:43:47.987 --> 00:43:51.717
being close pals,
being all those things,

00:43:51.717 --> 00:43:56.506
being part of a unit and yet
competing within that group for

00:43:56.506 --> 00:44:01.539
personal recognition and honor
and that is a contradiction,

00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:05.090
and it's a very interesting
kind of tug.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:09.020
I think you know this--you have
to understand that the Spartans

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.429
are living in a condition of
strain,

00:44:11.429 --> 00:44:14.434
it seems to me,
much greater than most

00:44:14.434 --> 00:44:19.263
societies impose on people.
But it's obviously arranged so

00:44:19.263 --> 00:44:24.528
effectively that it works;
we don't have an evidence sort

00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:30.503
of mass insanity or great need
for psychiatrists or anything

00:44:30.503 --> 00:44:34.221
like that.
If it was an insane society

00:44:34.221 --> 00:44:39.558
they were all insane in the same
way and they didn't know it,

00:44:39.558 --> 00:44:43.650
and I think that we have to
face that fact.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:46.900
This business of sameness I
think is important.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.630
They referred to one another
and they were referred to,

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:54.430
that is, the men who had grown
and become full citizens,

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:57.285
as homoioi.
Sometimes people translate this

00:44:57.285 --> 00:44:58.930
as equals.
No, that's not right.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:04.619
It is similar;
they are all like one another.

00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:07.376
I think they wouldn't have
called themselves equals,

00:45:07.376 --> 00:45:10.727
because there was this constant
sense that they are vying to be

00:45:10.727 --> 00:45:13.662
the best,
even as they are so similar to

00:45:13.662 --> 00:45:17.214
one another.
The legend has it that when

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:22.764
Lycurgus established the system,
he divided all of the land

00:45:22.764 --> 00:45:28.219
controlled by the Spartans into
9,000 patches of land.

00:45:28.219 --> 00:45:30.931
The Greek work is
kleroi,

00:45:30.931 --> 00:45:35.482
singular is kleros.
That was the theoretical thing,

00:45:35.482 --> 00:45:39.280
again they were all--in this
case, they were all equal in

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.851
their economic resources,
because each one had a

00:45:42.851 --> 00:45:46.193
kleros whose food,
the product of that

00:45:46.193 --> 00:45:49.079
kleros was his to deal
with,

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:51.011
and of course,
that amount,

00:45:51.011 --> 00:45:54.801
we're talking about,
that food was being produced on

00:45:54.801 --> 00:45:57.922
that kleros.
So, in theory,

00:45:57.922 --> 00:46:01.767
there's all of this similarity
and quasi equality,

00:46:01.767 --> 00:46:06.789
but age was another important
distinction among the Spartans,

00:46:06.789 --> 00:46:10.324
as is true in most primitive
societies, and the older the

00:46:10.324 --> 00:46:16.690
society I think the truer it is,
age is given tremendous respect.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:22.813
Just by being older than
somebody you are treated as,

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:28.230
in some sense,
better than a younger person.

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:33.598
But it wasn't pure age,
because it's also true that the

00:46:33.598 --> 00:46:39.165
honor that you had gained in
your life would also produce

00:46:39.165 --> 00:46:45.131
respect in proportion to how
great had been your contribution

00:46:45.131 --> 00:46:49.361
to the state.
I don't think they had formal

00:46:49.361 --> 00:46:52.282
ways of indicating that.
I don't think there's a

00:46:52.282 --> 00:46:53.929
question of medals or anything
like that.

00:46:53.929 --> 00:47:00.099
Everybody knew in a state of
this size, everybody knew who

00:47:00.099 --> 00:47:04.320
was who and treated them
accordingly.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:09.715
Now, there were also over
time, there grew up to be

00:47:09.715 --> 00:47:16.010
inequalities not only of age and
of honor but also of wealth.

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:19.898
It's a little bit hard to know
how all this came about,

00:47:19.898 --> 00:47:23.786
but at different times in
Spartan history you see there

00:47:23.786 --> 00:47:27.963
are people who have managed to
lose their kleros and

00:47:27.963 --> 00:47:31.779
when you don't have a
kleros you don't have the

00:47:31.779 --> 00:47:35.595
necessary wherewithal to make
your contribution to the

00:47:35.595 --> 00:47:40.525
syssition,
the mess at which you all dine,

00:47:40.525 --> 00:47:45.919
and when that happens you have
dropped out of the Spartan

00:47:45.919 --> 00:47:50.260
citizen body.
You are no longer a Spartiate,

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:55.488
you are something lesser and
that is a very tough kind of

00:47:55.488 --> 00:48:00.250
thing for a man to have to live
in as a Spartan.

00:48:10.449 --> 00:48:14.531
So poverty could keep you out
of the system,

00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:19.277
and if for any reason,
you had not gone through the

00:48:19.277 --> 00:48:22.980
agoge from beginning to
end,

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.929
you were not a regular full
Spartan.

00:48:26.929 --> 00:48:31.010
Also, if anybody had been
declared to be cowardly in

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:34.929
fighting in the war,
that person could be stricken

00:48:34.929 --> 00:48:39.170
from the roles of Spartan
citizens and yet they had no

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:43.409
place else to go,
and so as we will see they

00:48:43.409 --> 00:48:49.039
lived a rather wretched life in
Sparta after that situation.

00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:53.432
Similarly,
if people were thought not to

00:48:53.432 --> 00:48:58.539
be the children of two Spartans,
Spartan father,

00:48:58.539 --> 00:49:02.977
a Spartan mother then they were
not Spartiates,

00:49:02.977 --> 00:49:08.958
they held an inferior place in
that society and in a society so

00:49:08.958 --> 00:49:13.300
riddled with issues of honor and
respect,

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.989
you can imagine that was a very
big deal.

00:49:15.989 --> 00:49:18.417
Keep that in the back of your
mind because as we move on in

00:49:18.417 --> 00:49:20.969
the course and as we get into
the fifth century especially,

00:49:20.969 --> 00:49:24.951
we will be running into
Spartans who fit these

00:49:24.951 --> 00:49:28.489
categories, who are not 100%
Spartans,

00:49:28.489 --> 00:49:32.678
and yet, some of them become
tremendously important and

00:49:32.678 --> 00:49:37.021
powerful figures in Sparta and
we'll want to ask how that

00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:40.013
happened,
but even more we'll want to ask

00:49:40.013 --> 00:49:43.340
how that shaped the way they
behaved once they became

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.891
important people.
Now, up to now,

00:49:45.891 --> 00:49:49.503
I've been talking about men,
but it's important to talk

00:49:49.503 --> 00:49:54.504
about Spartan women too,
because they were different

00:49:54.504 --> 00:50:01.130
from other Greek women,
just as the men were different.

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:04.577
Just to make that clear,
let me make it plain that the

00:50:04.577 --> 00:50:07.179
rest of the Greeks treated women
very,

00:50:07.179 --> 00:50:11.949
very differently from men,
and one thing that was very

00:50:11.949 --> 00:50:17.619
striking and the difference was
that the men engaged in physical

00:50:17.619 --> 00:50:20.163
exercise,
especially in these

00:50:20.163 --> 00:50:23.488
competitions that were part of
the great games,

00:50:23.488 --> 00:50:27.030
and those were always carried
out in the nude.

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:32.503
Women did not engage in these
sports activities and it would

00:50:32.503 --> 00:50:37.513
have been the greatest
conceivable shame for a woman to

00:50:37.513 --> 00:50:41.425
be seen in the nude,
it was just absolutely

00:50:41.425 --> 00:50:44.260
unthinkable for the ordinary
Greeks.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:48.331
But the Spartans do things
their own way,

00:50:48.331 --> 00:50:53.420
and their women engage in
dancing and athletics,

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:58.313
and in competition and they did
so in the nude,

00:50:58.313 --> 00:51:03.738
just as the boys did,
and so they were not shut away

00:51:03.738 --> 00:51:09.908
from the boys all the time in
the way that Greek girls were

00:51:09.908 --> 00:51:14.527
kept away from the boys.
I don't mean to say they

00:51:14.527 --> 00:51:17.230
were allowed to mingle socially,
but that is to say,

00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:21.100
if the boys were exercising
here the girls might be

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.809
exercising there,
someplace else.

00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:27.503
They would not be kept so far
apart from one another,

00:51:27.503 --> 00:51:31.338
and again, think about all
this--all of the things that

00:51:31.338 --> 00:51:36.053
normal human desires think,
how that would get exciting and

00:51:36.053 --> 00:51:40.594
this kind of stuff that I've
been describing and yet they

00:51:40.594 --> 00:51:45.540
would never have a crack at them
until they got to be 20 years

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:48.570
old.
It all reminds me of a

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:54.741
wonderful footnote in a book
about English History from 1914

00:51:54.741 --> 00:51:57.670
to 1945 by A.J.P.
Taylor.

00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:04.008
Some of the best stuff was in
his footnotes and this one

00:52:04.008 --> 00:52:10.347
says--he was telling about the
drop of the birth rate in

00:52:10.347 --> 00:52:13.181
England,
late nineteenth,

00:52:13.181 --> 00:52:16.446
early twentieth century,
and he says,

00:52:16.446 --> 00:52:21.979
that it was not accompanied by
a growth of knowledge of or use

00:52:21.979 --> 00:52:26.783
of contraceptive devices,
and he concludes anybody who

00:52:26.783 --> 00:52:30.950
studies in England in this
period must realize that he is

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:34.150
dealing with a deeply frustrated
people.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:37.041
Well, if that's true of the
British, I mean think of what

00:52:37.041 --> 00:52:40.140
life in Sparta was like for a
young man and a young woman.

00:52:47.099 --> 00:52:52.262
So, on the one hand,
you have women who are treated

00:52:52.262 --> 00:52:57.902
more like men in Sparta than in
other places and indeed they

00:52:57.902 --> 00:53:04.019
even had greater legal rights
than they did in other states.

00:53:04.019 --> 00:53:10.692
And I think all of that plays a
part in the notion of degrading

00:53:10.692 --> 00:53:17.150
the family as it is usually
understood in the Greek world,

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:22.014
and elevating the notion of a
male dominated,

00:53:22.014 --> 00:53:29.090
a male centered society for the
purpose of producing warriors.

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:32.340
Why are the women given this
special status?

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:37.186
Because of the recognition that
women play a critical role in

00:53:37.186 --> 00:53:41.952
producing the same kinds of
warriors and that's what they're

00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:44.188
about.
One aspect of this,

00:53:44.188 --> 00:53:48.547
to show you that it's all for
the polis and it's all

00:53:48.547 --> 00:53:52.906
for the business of producing
good fighting men--there were

00:53:52.906 --> 00:53:56.889
actually in a sense group rights
with the women.

00:53:56.889 --> 00:54:00.730
For instance,
if a man found that his wife

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:05.320
couldn't bear children it was
legal and proper,

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:11.678
and normal for a man who was
his friend to lend him his wife

00:54:11.678 --> 00:54:18.359
and that the child who came from
that union would belong to the

00:54:18.359 --> 00:54:22.920
man who had been childless.
Again, think.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:27.090
I mean, what is happening to
all the normal feelings about

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:31.408
people have for one another and
the central role that family

00:54:31.408 --> 00:54:35.139
plays in almost every society
you can think of.

00:54:35.139 --> 00:54:39.577
On the other hand,
we should not imagine that

00:54:39.577 --> 00:54:45.427
women had a role in Spartan
society that was anything equal

00:54:45.427 --> 00:54:49.417
to the men.
Like in every other part of the

00:54:49.417 --> 00:54:53.813
Greek world, the women were
excluded from political life

00:54:53.813 --> 00:54:58.369
entirely, and yet--there's all
this conflicting stuff.

00:54:58.369 --> 00:55:00.190
Let me tell you the next thing
I want to tell you about.

00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:06.855
The marriage ceremony in Sparta
shows you a very odd kind of a

00:55:06.855 --> 00:55:08.806
thing.
First of all,

00:55:08.806 --> 00:55:12.368
it happens--these are all
ritual activities,

00:55:12.368 --> 00:55:17.090
but you ritually seize the girl
you're going to marry.

00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:21.817
It's as though you're saying
that the fundamental basic way

00:55:21.817 --> 00:55:26.869
you find a family is you grab a
woman and she becomes yours.

00:55:26.869 --> 00:55:34.014
Then the marriage ceremony
itself, the girl has her head

00:55:34.014 --> 00:55:38.820
shaved and she is dressed as a
man,

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:44.781
and sits in a darkened room
awaiting her groom and it seems

00:55:44.781 --> 00:55:50.743
to me that they're trying to
make her as much like a boy as

00:55:50.743 --> 00:55:56.705
they possibly can at this moment
of the consummation of the

00:55:56.705 --> 00:56:01.455
marriage for the first time.
Well, whatever my

00:56:01.455 --> 00:56:04.335
interpretation,
you've got to accept the

00:56:04.335 --> 00:56:08.840
weirdness of the world that I
have been describing to you.

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:12.710
Well, all of this you know
had this interesting impact.

00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:15.008
One other thing,
I haven't told you,

00:56:15.008 --> 00:56:18.882
my last thing I want to tell
you about women--when a Spartan

00:56:18.882 --> 00:56:23.085
woman was a mother she--Pericles
in this funeral oration ends the

00:56:23.085 --> 00:56:28.020
funeral oration and is saying,
now as to the wives and mothers

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:33.409
of these great men who have just
died, just shut up and go home,

00:56:33.409 --> 00:56:38.205
because the highest thing that
can be said about a woman is

00:56:38.205 --> 00:56:42.340
that she is never spoken of for
good or for ill.

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.079
This is democratic Athens we're
talking about.

00:56:45.079 --> 00:56:49.201
Well, nobody ever told a
Spartan mother to shut her

00:56:49.201 --> 00:56:54.230
mouth, because Greek literature
is filled with quotations from

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:57.610
Spartan mothers telling people
stuff,

00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:03.884
like telling their son to go
out to battle and come back with

00:57:03.884 --> 00:57:07.690
your shield or on it.
You know what the shields were

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:10.429
like?
You could use them as--what do

00:57:10.429 --> 00:57:13.869
you take bodies out with now?
Stretchers.

00:57:13.869 --> 00:57:17.338
And so, her message was you
come back, but if I heard you

00:57:17.338 --> 00:57:20.248
threw your shield away and ran,
don't come home,

00:57:20.248 --> 00:57:22.539
and there are all kinds of
tales.

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:25.333
So, Spartan women
obviously--I'll give you one

00:57:25.333 --> 00:57:27.719
other.
One time, late in their history

00:57:27.719 --> 00:57:30.334
when things are going bad for
the Spartans,

00:57:30.334 --> 00:57:34.069
a hostile army actually gets
into Sparta and the women are up

00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:36.559
there on the roofs of their
houses,

00:57:36.559 --> 00:57:41.791
throwing roof tiles as
projectiles against the enemy

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:45.274
army.
So Spartan women were really

00:57:45.274 --> 00:57:48.730
something else and there they
are.

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:51.840
But if you take the whole
picture, what is it?

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:55.453
It is, as I say,
the degradation of the family

00:57:55.453 --> 00:58:00.030
in favor of the importance of
the polis as a whole,

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:02.680
its needs, and its structure.

00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:10.352
It is a warrior ethic,
it is based upon the principle

00:58:10.352 --> 00:58:14.860
of the hoplite phalanx and I
want to read to you a piece of

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:17.969
poetry written by this Spartan
poet,

00:58:17.969 --> 00:58:22.311
Tyrtaeus, who is dated
somewhere in the seventh century

00:58:22.311 --> 00:58:26.975
that gets at a number of the
topics I've been talking about

00:58:26.975 --> 00:58:29.638
so far.
Here's how it goes:

00:58:29.638 --> 00:58:34.508
"I would not say anything for a
man, nor take account of him for

00:58:34.508 --> 00:58:38.296
any speed of his feet,
or wrestling skill he might

00:58:38.296 --> 00:58:41.068
have.
Not if he had the size of a

00:58:41.068 --> 00:58:44.030
Cyclops and the strength to go
with it.

00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:46.880
Not if he could outrun Boreas
the north wind.

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:52.123
Not if he were more handsome
and gracefully formed than

00:58:52.123 --> 00:58:56.298
Tythonius or had more riches
than Midas had,

00:58:56.298 --> 00:58:59.925
or Cenarius too.
Not if he were more of a king

00:58:59.925 --> 00:59:03.062
than Tantalus or Pelops,
or had the power of speech and

00:59:03.062 --> 00:59:07.502
persuasion that Adrastas had."
That is a catalog of all the

00:59:07.502 --> 00:59:11.916
things that people admire and
want for themselves,

00:59:11.916 --> 00:59:15.159
and regard as important in
Homer;

00:59:15.159 --> 00:59:17.981
everything, those are the
characteristics that every hero

00:59:17.981 --> 00:59:21.439
wants, and he says,
I don't give a damn for all

00:59:21.439 --> 00:59:26.060
that says Tyrtaeus for no
man--I'm sorry I skipped an

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:30.273
important line.
"I don't care about any of

00:59:30.273 --> 00:59:36.404
those things not if he had all
splendors except for a fighting

00:59:36.404 --> 00:59:39.747
spirit.
For no man ever proves himself

00:59:39.747 --> 00:59:44.656
a good man in war unless he can
endure to face the blood and the

00:59:44.656 --> 00:59:48.000
slaughter,
to go close against the enemy

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.573
and fight with his hands."
Here is arête,

00:59:52.573 --> 00:59:57.070
which my translator translates
as courage, which is fair;

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:59.258
that's the most fundamental
meaning of it,

00:59:59.258 --> 01:00:01.820
but anyway, it is the word
arête.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:06.305
"Mankind's finest possession,
here is the noblest prize that

01:00:06.305 --> 01:00:11.235
a young man can endeavor to win.
It is a good thing his city and

01:00:11.235 --> 01:00:15.774
all the people share with him,
when a man plants his feet and

01:00:15.774 --> 01:00:19.860
stands firm among the foremost
spears relentlessly.

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:24.980
All thought of foul flight
completely forgotten and as well

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:29.130
trained his heart to be
steadfast and endure,

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:33.454
and with words encourages the
man who is stationed besides

01:00:33.454 --> 01:00:36.489
him.
Here is a man who proves

01:00:36.489 --> 01:00:41.041
himself valiant in war.
With a sudden rush he turns to

01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:44.720
fight the rugged battalions of
the enemy and sustains the

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.869
beating wave of assault."
I don't care about any of those

01:00:47.869 --> 01:00:50.109
things that you read about in
the Iliad and the

01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:53.223
Odyssey,
all I care about is how do you

01:00:53.223 --> 01:00:55.889
fight when you're in the
phalanx?

01:00:55.889 --> 01:00:59.519
If you don't have it there
you're nothing.

01:00:59.519 --> 01:01:03.629
To continue,
he's now going to examine the

01:01:03.629 --> 01:01:07.100
question of what happens if you
die.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.681
I mean, that happens doesn't it?
Here's what he says,

01:01:10.681 --> 01:01:15.582
"And he who so falls among the
champions and loses his sweet

01:01:15.582 --> 01:01:17.608
life."
Notice that here he is

01:01:17.608 --> 01:01:21.093
telling--he's going to tell you
in a moment how good it is to

01:01:21.093 --> 01:01:23.940
die in this way,
but he's not kidding himself;

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.260
life is sweet.
You've lost it.

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:29.239
Here is that wonderful Greek
realism that I told you about.

01:01:29.239 --> 01:01:33.498
"And loses his sweet life so
blessing with honor,

01:01:33.498 --> 01:01:38.110
his polis, his father,
and all his people with wounds

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:42.546
in his chest where the spear
that he was facing has

01:01:42.546 --> 01:01:48.046
transfixed the massive guard of
his shield and gone through his

01:01:48.046 --> 01:01:52.641
breastplate as well.
Why such a man is lamented

01:01:52.641 --> 01:01:57.108
alike by the young and the
elders, and all his city goes

01:01:57.108 --> 01:02:00.519
into mourning and grieves for
his loss.

01:02:00.519 --> 01:02:06.143
His tomb is pointed to with
pride and so are his children,

01:02:06.143 --> 01:02:11.964
and his children's children,
and afterward all the race that

01:02:11.964 --> 01:02:15.186
is his.
His shining glory is never

01:02:15.186 --> 01:02:17.990
forgotten.
His name is remembered,

01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:22.949
and he becomes an immortal
though he lies under the ground,

01:02:22.949 --> 01:02:26.990
when one who was a brave man
has been killed by the furious

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:30.833
war god, standing his ground,
and fighting hard for his

01:02:30.833 --> 01:02:33.967
children and his land."
I hope you noticed all of

01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:37.159
the things we've been talking
about that are contained in that

01:02:37.159 --> 01:02:39.190
statement.
All of those are reasons why

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:42.230
you should be willing to risk
your life for your polis,

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:45.277
because thereby,
you can win yourself

01:02:45.277 --> 01:02:50.949
immortality, one of the few ways
that you can do that as a Greek.

01:02:50.949 --> 01:02:55.300
Okay, but there is
another--what if things go well?

01:02:55.300 --> 01:03:01.057
What if you don't get killed?
"But if he escapes the doom of

01:03:01.057 --> 01:03:04.909
that death, the destroyer of
bodies and wins his battle,

01:03:04.909 --> 01:03:08.450
and bright renown for the work
of his spear,

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:11.250
all men give place to him
alike.

01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:15.923
The youth and the elders,
and much joy comes his way

01:03:15.923 --> 01:03:21.937
before he goes down to the dead.
Aging, he has reputation among

01:03:21.937 --> 01:03:25.414
his citizens.
No one tries to interfere with

01:03:25.414 --> 01:03:29.965
his honors or all he deserves.
All men withdraw before his

01:03:29.965 --> 01:03:35.112
presence and yield their seats
to him, the youth and the men

01:03:35.112 --> 01:03:38.690
his age, and even those older
than he.

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:44.143
Thus, a man should endeavor to
reach this place of courage with

01:03:44.143 --> 01:03:48.102
all his heart,
and so trying never be backward

01:03:48.102 --> 01:03:50.936
in war.
"So it pays off for you to be

01:03:50.936 --> 01:03:55.120
brave and a good soldier in the
phalanx whether you live or die;

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.574
both of them are good ends.
Notice how slyly he makes the

01:03:59.574 --> 01:04:03.099
point about, even if things go
well for you before you die,

01:04:03.099 --> 01:04:05.571
meaning don't imagine if you
don't get killed in this battle

01:04:05.571 --> 01:04:08.480
you're going to live forever;
you're going to die anyway.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.014
Now, there was yet another
element in-- the songs of

01:04:13.014 --> 01:04:17.796
Tyrtaeus would have been the
songs that the boys would have

01:04:17.796 --> 01:04:22.990
been learned and would have been
taught in school and they would

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:27.690
have been marching along to the
music of that poem.

01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:30.414
But then Xenophon who wrote
late in the fifth,

01:04:30.414 --> 01:04:33.260
early fourth centuries,
an Athenian who knew the

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:36.843
Spartans well,
as I say, tells us about how

01:04:36.843 --> 01:04:42.188
the Spartans dealt with this
problem of instilling courage in

01:04:42.188 --> 01:04:45.840
their soldiers and avoid the
opposite.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.138
Here's what he says,
"In other states when a man

01:04:49.138 --> 01:04:52.436
proves a coward,
the only consequence is that he

01:04:52.436 --> 01:04:56.691
is called a coward.
He goes to the same market as

01:04:56.691 --> 01:04:59.880
the brave man and sits beside
him.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.860
He attends the same gymnasium
if he chooses.

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:08.090
But in Sparta everyone would be
ashamed to have a coward with

01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:13.670
him at the mess or to be matched
with him in a wrestling bout.

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:19.118
Often when sides are picked for
a game of ball he is the odd man

01:05:19.118 --> 01:05:23.036
left out.
In a chorus he is banished to

01:05:23.036 --> 01:05:26.853
the ignominious place.
In the streets he is bound to

01:05:26.853 --> 01:05:28.570
make way when he occupies a
seat;

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:32.909
he must give it up even to a
younger man.

01:05:32.909 --> 01:05:39.744
He must support his spinster
relatives at home and he must

01:05:39.744 --> 01:05:44.780
explain to them why they are old
maids."

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:48.320
Nobody's going to marry the
sister of a coward.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:53.456
Think of the joy of meeting
your sister at home everyday as

01:05:53.456 --> 01:05:58.238
she looks at you and realizes
she's not going to have a

01:05:58.238 --> 01:06:02.449
husband because of you.
"He must make the best of a

01:06:02.449 --> 01:06:05.619
fireside without a wife,
because who would marry such a

01:06:05.619 --> 01:06:08.980
man?
Yet, pay forfeit for that.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:12.690
He may not stroll about with a
cheerful countenance."

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:17.038
If he walks around with a smile
on his face somebody's going to

01:06:17.038 --> 01:06:20.040
knock it off.
"Now behave as though he were a

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:24.004
man of unsullied fame or else he
must submit to be beaten by his

01:06:24.004 --> 01:06:26.685
betters."
"Small wonder," I think says

01:06:26.685 --> 01:06:30.742
Xenophon, "that where such a
load of dishonor is laid on the

01:06:30.742 --> 01:06:34.366
coward,
death seems preferable to a

01:06:34.366 --> 01:06:38.389
life so dishonored,
so ignominious."

01:06:38.389 --> 01:06:40.873
Now the truth is,
I think, Xenophon is

01:06:40.873 --> 01:06:44.618
exaggerating.
I don't think it would be fun

01:06:44.618 --> 01:06:50.380
to come home after behaving like
a coward in any Greek city,

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:54.814
but I do think it's fair to say
that it would have been

01:06:54.814 --> 01:06:58.510
intolerable if you're talking
about Sparta.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.375
Yeah, we have some time.
Let me turn now to the more

01:07:05.375 --> 01:07:11.720
formal constitution of the state
as we would use the term today.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:19.579
It is unique in Greek life.
It is a mixed constitution.

01:07:19.579 --> 01:07:22.618
It is not democracy,
it's not a monarchy,

01:07:22.618 --> 01:07:26.340
it's not an oligarchy,
it's not an aristocracy;

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:31.140
it contains elements of every
one of those more normal

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:34.320
constitutions.
There are kings.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.985
Notice I say plural,
because there are two kings at

01:07:37.985 --> 01:07:40.550
any one time,
each descending from a

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:44.245
different royal family.
These kings have priestly

01:07:44.245 --> 01:07:47.705
responsibilities.
They serve--and this is very

01:07:47.705 --> 01:07:51.679
important--as generals who lead
the Spartan army.

01:07:51.679 --> 01:07:55.849
They are judges in all sorts of
cases.

01:07:55.849 --> 01:08:00.379
At any gathering of a public
nature they hold a seat of

01:08:00.379 --> 01:08:03.850
honor.
At banquets they get a double

01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:05.784
portion;
I don't think we should

01:08:05.784 --> 01:08:08.653
understand that to mean that you
get very big fat kings who eat

01:08:08.653 --> 01:08:12.033
twice as much as anybody else.
I think this gives them an

01:08:12.033 --> 01:08:16.240
opportunity to share that with
their friends and to hand out

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.949
honors, and to be thanked for
that.

01:08:18.949 --> 01:08:22.018
When the Spartans appoint
somebody to be their

01:08:22.018 --> 01:08:25.274
representative in another
state--that's their form of

01:08:25.274 --> 01:08:29.425
diplomatic relations,
the man who appoints the

01:08:29.425 --> 01:08:33.519
proxenos,
that's the Greek word,

01:08:33.519 --> 01:08:37.289
the kings make that
appointment.

01:08:37.289 --> 01:08:41.411
When the Spartans have to
consult a Delphic Oracle,

01:08:41.411 --> 01:08:45.715
men called the pythioi,
are the ones who are sent to

01:08:45.715 --> 01:08:49.224
make the inquiry and bring back
the answer, the kings select

01:08:49.224 --> 01:08:51.215
them.
Well, these are,

01:08:51.215 --> 01:08:55.760
of course, the enormously
honorific activities.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:00.376
So the kings are in a position
to hand out very important

01:09:00.376 --> 01:09:04.964
honors to their fellow Spartans,
and that I think is another one

01:09:04.964 --> 01:09:07.210
of the important privileges they
have.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:12.583
If there is an heiress who does
not have a husband,

01:09:12.583 --> 01:09:18.710
this could be typically a woman
whose husband has died,

01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:23.388
and now she needs to be married
to somebody else--that

01:09:23.388 --> 01:09:28.170
assignment is made by the kings.
They tell that woman whom she's

01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:31.268
going to marry.
The reason behind it is that

01:09:31.268 --> 01:09:35.235
she has no brothers,
no uncles who could inherit her

01:09:35.235 --> 01:09:40.369
father's kleros and other
wealth that now goes with her.

01:09:40.369 --> 01:09:43.923
She has to be assigned to
somebody on behalf of the

01:09:43.923 --> 01:09:45.995
Spartan state.
Likewise,

01:09:45.995 --> 01:09:49.736
if there are adoptions of
children from one family to

01:09:49.736 --> 01:09:53.550
another, it is the kings who
make these decisions.

01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:57.640
The kings also sit on the
council that is the dominant

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:02.039
advisory consulting element in
the whole Spartan state;

01:10:02.039 --> 01:10:04.264
it is called the
gerousia,

01:10:04.264 --> 01:10:08.019
which would be translated into
Latin as senatus,

01:10:08.019 --> 01:10:12.479
our word Senate.
It is a council of elders.

01:10:12.479 --> 01:10:17.928
It consists of twenty eight men
over the age of sixty who are

01:10:17.928 --> 01:10:23.467
elected by the Spartans and the
two kings who sit with them to

01:10:23.467 --> 01:10:26.010
produce a council of 30.

01:10:30.409 --> 01:10:34.730
The kingship is hereditary in
each line, with this little bump

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:38.625
in it, and that is it's
necessarily the first son of the

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:42.209
previous king.
It's the first son born after

01:10:42.209 --> 01:10:45.344
the king has become king.
So, if there's any question

01:10:45.344 --> 01:10:47.080
about that, that's the
determining element.

01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:54.162
The kings are the only Spartans
who are not required to go

01:10:54.162 --> 01:10:57.646
through the agoge.
I think the idea was it would

01:10:57.646 --> 01:11:00.767
be demeaning for the royal
figure to have to be beaten up

01:11:00.767 --> 01:11:03.164
by older boys,
that's probably what's behind

01:11:03.164 --> 01:11:03.610
it.

01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:10.411
On the other hand,
I think we should be aware that

01:11:10.411 --> 01:11:13.352
these are even less than
the--you remember we spoke of

01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:16.682
the Greek basileus in the
early days as perhaps having

01:11:16.682 --> 01:11:20.270
some kind of a royal function,
but never a real one.

01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:22.969
Well, the Spartans have the
power, but the Spartan kings

01:11:22.969 --> 01:11:25.079
have that power that I've just
described,

01:11:25.079 --> 01:11:30.058
but another thing that reduces
their kingly character is that

01:11:30.058 --> 01:11:34.593
there are two of them.
That means one can always veto

01:11:34.593 --> 01:11:39.850
the other, and that means they
never can have the kind of power

01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:42.393
that a true king,
in our sense,

01:11:42.393 --> 01:11:45.340
would have.
Two other things.

01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:50.034
One is the gerousia,
this council of elders has very

01:11:50.034 --> 01:11:54.729
important powers and some of
them relating to the kings.

01:11:54.729 --> 01:11:57.747
There is another group of
Spartans, another council--I

01:11:57.747 --> 01:12:00.479
should have told you that the
gerousia,

01:12:00.479 --> 01:12:03.504
once the men are chosen they
serve for life,

01:12:03.504 --> 01:12:06.810
but there's another council in
Sparta of men,

01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:09.720
five of them,
called ephors.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:14.791
These ephors are
ordinary Spartans who come just

01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:18.513
from anybody who is a Spartan.
One of the powers they have

01:12:18.513 --> 01:12:20.294
vis à
vis the kings,

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:23.243
is they can bring charges
against the kings,

01:12:23.243 --> 01:12:27.289
if they believe that either of
the kings has done wrong,

01:12:27.289 --> 01:12:30.664
violated the law,
done something improper and

01:12:30.664 --> 01:12:34.500
then the kings are tried by the
gerousia.

01:12:37.739 --> 01:12:41.505
If you think that's just pro
forma activity,

01:12:41.505 --> 01:12:46.174
Spartan history is filled with
kings who have been convicted of

01:12:46.174 --> 01:12:50.090
some crime or other and are
driven off into exile and

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:55.699
removed from the kingship.
So these are very powerful

01:12:55.699 --> 01:12:58.300
limitations.
I think I'm out of time.

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:02.506
So, I'll start next time by
completing our discussion of the

01:13:02.506 --> 01:13:06.000
Spartan state and move forward
from there.

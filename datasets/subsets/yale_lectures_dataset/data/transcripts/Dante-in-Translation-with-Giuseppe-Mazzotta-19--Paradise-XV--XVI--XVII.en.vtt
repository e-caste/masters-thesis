00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.380
Prof: Last time we
looked at the cantos of the sun,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.730
which is the canto of
arithmetic and so--

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.572
;and we discussed actually the
variety of philosophical

00:00:17.572 --> 00:00:22.146
strengths,
theological and philosophical

00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:27.090
ideas that compose Dante's
circle of knowledge,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.660
this encyclopedic compass or
what's worth knowing.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.351
Today, we move into the Heaven
of Mars, which is as you know,

00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:42.589
the god of war,
the name of the planet,

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.270
and it's the heaven of music.
 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.280
Dante links Mars and music
because harmony,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.366
out of the belief that harmony
is the meeting point or the

00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:03.963
result of discordant elements,
a kind of concordia,

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:08.129
a concord,
an attuning of hearts reached

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:10.930
through discordant elements.
 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.650
The discordant elements can be
different sounds;

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.409
it can be the passions within
us that need tempering and so

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:19.819
on.
 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.890
This canto is--can be read
prophetably and you can do some

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.360
of this on your own in
conjunction --

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.709
I will allude to it in passing
-- in conjunction with canto,

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:32.846
for instance,
XV of Hell;

00:01:32.846 --> 00:01:36.019
within XV, XVI,
and XVII of Paradise.

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:40.672
You could read it;
XV was the encounter with

00:01:40.672 --> 00:01:44.959
Dante's own ancestor
Cacciaguida,

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:50.424
and so inevitably the reference
to Brunetto Lantini literally

00:01:50.424 --> 00:01:53.601
imposes itself on us,
it compels us,

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:57.355
we are compelled to draw
parallels and see differences

00:01:57.355 --> 00:02:00.188
between the two ancestors who
claim,

00:02:00.188 --> 00:02:05.400
make different claims on this
descendant --

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.923
intellectual and dynastic
descendant -- who is Dante

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:10.810
himself.
 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.657
You could also look at it from
other, many other points of

00:02:14.657 --> 00:02:15.128
view.
 

00:02:15.128 --> 00:02:17.413
The point of view,
for instance,

00:02:17.413 --> 00:02:21.688
of the other references to war
and the kind of the clashing

00:02:21.688 --> 00:02:25.889
sounds throughout Inferno
that Dante produces.

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:30.068
If I were to give a title to my
remarks today,

00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:35.337
which I really don't because I
think it's the variety of

00:02:35.337 --> 00:02:41.276
suggestions coming from a canto
takes over the desire to be too

00:02:41.276 --> 00:02:45.270
schematic and thematic,
but if I were to give a title

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.348
today I think it's really very
encompassing,

00:02:47.348 --> 00:02:50.500
I would call it "Self and
History."

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.115
These seem to the most--the
strongest questions that Dante

00:02:57.115 --> 00:02:58.160
raises.
 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.729
They're not--the terms,
the question self and history--

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:07.150
the relationship between the
two may be new to us here,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.740
but we certainly have been
talking about history before.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.397
The last time we did was in the
discussion of Canto VI of

00:03:13.397 --> 00:03:16.485
Paradise,
where Dante gives -- in the

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:21.080
Heaven of Mercury --
Dante gives this overall

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.729
history of Rome,
its humble beginnings and then

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:30.520
the deconstruction of the empire
and the crisis of the empire.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.568
So that's really one thing that
you know.

00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:37.367
The issue of self in itself is
something we have been

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:40.490
discussing ever since we started
the Vita nuova,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.008
with the idea of a lyrical
self, of a self who removes

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:46.288
himself,
as you recall.

00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:47.979
That's what we mean by a
lyrical self,

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:50.740
removes oneself from the world
of history,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.115
the contingencies of time,
the viscous realities of the

00:03:57.115 --> 00:04:00.486
city,
and takes shelter in the

00:04:00.486 --> 00:04:06.050
chamber of his imagination in
the world of his ideas,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.561
his dreams, and memories,
and there he constructs his own

00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:10.000
self.
 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.938
That was the point of the
Vita nuova.

00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:15.038
When we began reading the
Divine Comedy I insisted

00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:18.084
on the autobiographical focus
with which at least the

00:04:18.084 --> 00:04:19.689
Divine Comedy begins.
 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:25.430
This is his story,
this is his unique experience,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.500
the pilgrim's own--Dante's own
unique experience and that seems

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.980
to have come to an end with
Purgatorio XXX when

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.870
finally the novel of the self is
sealed.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.766
As you remember,
with the mentioning of the name

00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:41.016
Dante,
then a new phase begins in

00:04:41.016 --> 00:04:45.540
Dante's construction,
which is more educational,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.117
more speculative,
which is really the world of

00:04:48.117 --> 00:04:48.810
Paradise.
 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.630
But so, we talk about self and
history in a way that maybe

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.050
Dante's never quite coupled the
two terms before;

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.894
he does so in Canto XV,
XVI, and XVII of

00:04:59.894 --> 00:05:01.670
Paradise.
 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.600
This is really the double focus
around which everything moves.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.137
Let me give you--I will give
you a reading of the various

00:05:11.137 --> 00:05:13.711
details,
but let me give you an idea of

00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:17.134
what I have in mind first of all
and the way of thinking about

00:05:17.134 --> 00:05:17.920
this issue.
 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.949
I want to draw your attention
to the presence of some mythic,

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:26.300
mythological figures that
Dante--whom Dante is evoking and

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.660
they are very different among
themselves,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.947
but they're all--it's a way of
reflecting on Dante's own idea

00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:38.238
of selfhood,
Dante's own relationship to an

00:05:38.238 --> 00:05:40.975
ancestor,
his own private history,

00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:45.593
who in turn has had a very
complex and for Dante nobling

00:05:45.593 --> 00:05:47.860
relationship to history.
 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.408
He is a crusader;
he fought in the Second Crusade

00:05:51.408 --> 00:05:54.060
of 1149 under the Emperor
Conrad;

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.045
he is proud of this belonging
to the crusader,

00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:00.259
to fight as a crusader.
 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.204
A version of the relationship
one has or thinks one has with

00:06:04.204 --> 00:06:08.350
history, both Cacciaguida's and
Dante's own relationship to his

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.420
grandfather.
 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.572
Let me tell you first of all
these mythic figures and then

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:13.899
we'll talk about them.
 

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:18.125
Dante is--beginning with Canto
XV I will just remark in

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:22.038
passing, I will not--I will
leave it to you do more

00:06:22.038 --> 00:06:25.170
diligently than we could do it
here.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.148
The presence of musical
metaphors, which is not

00:06:27.148 --> 00:06:29.651
surprising,
in the Heaven of the Music,

00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:32.089
"Gracious will,
into which--"

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:33.870
this is the beginning of Canto
XV,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.668
"Rightly-breathing love,
always resolves itself,

00:06:36.668 --> 00:06:38.779
as does cupidity into an
ill-will,

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.490
imposed silence on that sweet
lyre."

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.740
This is the--The soul becomes a
kind of musical instrument,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.228
the sweet lyre and stilled the
sacred strings which the right

00:06:50.228 --> 00:06:53.370
hand of heaven tightens and
relaxes and so on."

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.589
Then this, "And the
gem," at one point,

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:01.177
this is line 20,
"And the gem did not leave

00:07:01.177 --> 00:07:03.605
its ribbon,
but ran across by the radial

00:07:03.605 --> 00:07:05.970
strip and seemed fire behind
alabaster.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.490
With such affection did
Anchises' shade reached out,

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.257
if we may trust our greatest
muse, when in Elysium he knew

00:07:16.257 --> 00:07:19.269
his son,"
and then in Latin,

00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:21.829
a quotation,
"O sanguis meus,

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:26.367
o superinfusa gratia Dei,
sicut tibi cui bis unquam coeli

00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:28.149
janua reclusa?"
 

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:32.336
To whom has this privilege ever
been given of having the gates

00:07:32.336 --> 00:07:35.699
of heaven open to him twice,
"the light spoke

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:36.730
thus."
 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.240
So this is the first mythical
reference.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.596
We are really--we could just
say, well Dante of course at the

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:48.028
very beginning of Inferno
makes a reference to Paul and

00:07:48.028 --> 00:07:51.949
Aeneas disavowing any strict
connection with them.

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:55.708
You remember when he resists
the call to this huge risky

00:07:55.708 --> 00:08:00.149
enterprise of going through hell
that comes to him from Virgil.

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:02.850
He says, I'm not Aeneas,
I'm not Paul,

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:07.892
why should I do what you are
calling me to perform and Aeneas

00:08:07.892 --> 00:08:13.610
is the one who had visited Hades
to meet the shade of his father,

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.422
Anchises, now recalled here,
and of course Paul is the who

00:08:17.422 --> 00:08:20.500
had been taken wrapped to the
third heaven,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.449
meaning a third mode of vision
that allowed him to--

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:28.949
and kept quiet about it,
to see God face to face.

00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:34.229
Anchises, the encounter between
Anchises and Aeneas here,

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:38.659
stands for a sort of
relationship of Aeneas that

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.298
Aeneas has with history.
 

00:08:41.298 --> 00:08:45.719
Aeneas goes to Hades in order
to find out what the purposes

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:50.366
are for his journeying from Troy
toward an unknown land and he

00:08:50.366 --> 00:08:53.640
discovers--
it's a way of Anchises

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.594
discovers that he--
from his own father the

00:08:57.594 --> 00:09:02.849
presage, the prophetic if you
wish announcement of what it is

00:09:02.849 --> 00:09:05.740
for him to be part of history.
 

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.855
Somehow a definition of self,
that's what you find with

00:09:08.855 --> 00:09:12.320
Anchises and the Aeneid,
can be understood as that.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.000
The sense that one--how does
one belong in history?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.642
One belongs in history as part
of a providential pattern as the

00:09:21.642 --> 00:09:26.009
idea that this was a destined
empire that he,

00:09:26.009 --> 00:09:29.808
Anchises, has to found,
and a new history would start,

00:09:29.808 --> 00:09:34.152
so that he confirms his
attachment to the dead father

00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:38.827
and yet he starts now as the
point of beginning for a new

00:09:38.827 --> 00:09:39.830
history.
 

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.894
This is one way of
understanding an epic,

00:09:42.894 --> 00:09:46.038
the epic account,
a myth of one's own self

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:48.567
belonging in the world of
history.

00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:50.330
This is mythical.
 

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:56.570
We move on, and it's really a
big--sort of a reversal of this.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:01.687
I will come back into Canto XVI;
Dante gives a chronicle of the

00:10:01.687 --> 00:10:03.230
City of Florence.
 

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.089
That is to say,
first of all,

00:10:05.089 --> 00:10:08.940
he's making problematical to us
the idea of where are we to

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.798
understand this as self?
 

00:10:10.798 --> 00:10:14.820
This is--it's not clear what we
are to understand as a self.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:20.730
In the Vita nuova the
self is this nexus of memories,

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.740
fantasies, and a will to write
poetry.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.686
In that sense the text
constitutes oneself,

00:10:27.686 --> 00:10:28.527
into a self.
 

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:31.379
I am myself;
I'm the author of this text.

00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:34.710
This becomes a point of
reference and this is what I am.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.232
The image and poetry that I
give of myself gives you an idea

00:10:38.232 --> 00:10:39.070
of who I am.
 

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.052
It doubles me,
it perpetuates me,

00:10:41.052 --> 00:10:44.769
it's a poetic version of self,
but we don't know yet what are

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.320
we to take as a self.
 

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.700
Anchises has a different
understanding of himself.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.936
I am who I am only because I
belong to a larger pattern of

00:10:53.936 --> 00:10:54.678
history.
 

00:10:54.678 --> 00:10:58.788
This larger pattern of history
is going to be me as a founder,

00:10:58.788 --> 00:11:03.980
a founder of a new way of
looking at the world,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.288
the founder of Rome and he gets
the message from his own father.

00:11:08.288 --> 00:11:11.075
In Canto XVI,
and I will not go into this as

00:11:11.075 --> 00:11:14.379
I'm pursuing the theme of the
mythic references,

00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:18.999
Dante goes on really thinking
about writing a chronicle as I

00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:21.740
will say in the City of
Florence.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.860
One, Florence is famous for its
chroniclers,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.403
the beginning of the Middle
Ages, and so is history then the

00:11:28.403 --> 00:11:32.370
other problematical notion to be
understood as the loco,

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.129
events, or is to be understood
the way Anchises understands it,

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:42.244
as a myth that somehow has a
sort of paradigmatic value and

00:11:42.244 --> 00:11:46.250
which can regulate and also
arrange.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.201
We can go on arranging our
lives according to the demands

00:11:50.201 --> 00:11:51.259
of that myth.
 

00:11:51.259 --> 00:11:54.945
Dante will not answer this
question directly here,

00:11:54.945 --> 00:11:59.381
but he does talk about all the
Florentine families and talks

00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:02.090
about them in an elegiac manner.
 

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.950
That is to say they're all
decayed,

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:09.331
they're all finished and
extinct, so whatever value this

00:12:09.331 --> 00:12:14.190
history may have it's an elegiac
commemoration of the past.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.780
Cacciaguida,
by the way, is very elated at

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.993
the idea that the son,
the grandson,

00:12:18.993 --> 00:12:22.278
the descendant wants to find
out about the past.

00:12:22.278 --> 00:12:26.388
We move then into Canto XVII,
where I think we find something

00:12:26.388 --> 00:12:29.950
about this whole issue about
history and the self.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:35.422
It begins in a peculiar manner,
look at the beginning of Canto

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:39.269
XVII,
the reference is really--it's a

00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:45.590
long periphrastic construction,
a long turn of phrase to--for

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:51.158
the pilgrim to describe himself
in terms of Phaeton,

00:12:51.158 --> 00:12:56.600
the famous figure as you know,
from the classical myth who

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.509
challenges Apollo.
 

00:12:58.509 --> 00:13:02.980
We saw him in the corresponding
Canto XVII of Inferno.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.923
There was an illusion there to
Phaeton so a little touch of the

00:13:06.923 --> 00:13:10.928
symmetry of cantos but that's
really secondary at this point.

00:13:10.928 --> 00:13:15.245
Look at what the scripture is,
"Like him who came to

00:13:15.245 --> 00:13:19.562
Clemente, to be reassured about
that which he had against

00:13:19.562 --> 00:13:20.950
himself."
 

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.663
The Disowning,
first of all,

00:13:22.663 --> 00:13:26.470
is the story of the uncertainty
of Phaeton's descendents,

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.538
that his father was Apollo,
so he reassured himself,

00:13:30.538 --> 00:13:33.692
"Him who still makes
fathers weary with their

00:13:33.692 --> 00:13:34.529
sons."
 

00:13:34.529 --> 00:13:37.429
This is in the Canto of
Cacciaguida.

00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:38.789
What is the real relationship?
 

00:13:38.789 --> 00:13:40.009
That's what that is asking.
 

00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:43.735
That I have to this noble
heroic figure of whom I'm proud,

00:13:43.735 --> 00:13:47.071
but what is the actual
relationship that joins me to

00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:47.658
them?
 

00:13:47.658 --> 00:13:51.827
"Such was I and such I was
perceived to be both by Beatrice

00:13:51.827 --> 00:13:55.335
and by the holy lamb that had
changed its place for me

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:56.460
before."
 

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:02.076
He's happy that--he seems to
reaffirm this genealogical line

00:14:02.076 --> 00:14:07.596
so history now becomes no longer
a chronicle, becomes now a

00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:08.928
genealogy.
 

00:14:08.928 --> 00:14:13.898
Can we establish some
certainties that we belong into

00:14:13.898 --> 00:14:16.000
a genealogical line?
 

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.278
Can that really account for us
and for who we are?

00:14:20.278 --> 00:14:22.500
This is the issue that Dante's
raising.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.294
The figure of Phaeton is a
tragic figure because it

00:14:26.294 --> 00:14:30.190
introduces the possibility of,
and Dante says this,

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:34.360
that's what makes fathers weary
of their sons all the time.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.980
The idea that the son wants to
outdo the father,

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.950
wants to go beyond the father,
and the idea of tragic

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:46.607
transgression that it can exist
and therefore breach that line

00:14:46.607 --> 00:14:49.565
of continuity between--
inter generations,

00:14:49.565 --> 00:14:50.759
across the generations.
 

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:52.610
That's one of the myths.
 

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.029
The other one is much more
tragic than before.

00:14:56.029 --> 00:15:01.299
Canto XVII, as you know,
goes on discussing among other

00:15:01.299 --> 00:15:05.009
things the--let me read the
passage.

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:07.918
I think Dante says it much more
sparingly,

00:15:07.918 --> 00:15:11.278
that is to say without--to my
despair--

00:15:11.278 --> 00:15:14.129
he says it much better than
anybody else can,

00:15:14.129 --> 00:15:17.480
"Contingency,"
this is line 36,

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.736
"Contingency,
which does not extend beyond

00:15:20.736 --> 00:15:24.916
the volume of your material
world is all depicted in Eternal

00:15:24.916 --> 00:15:26.120
Vision."
 

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.087
This is another way,
still another way of

00:15:28.087 --> 00:15:29.269
understanding history.
 

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:33.303
That there is a contingency
that the world of contingency

00:15:33.303 --> 00:15:37.408
can be subsumed within a larger
transcendent paradigm,

00:15:37.408 --> 00:15:40.980
that seems to be the order of
necessity.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.472
The contingent world is linked
to the volume where all things

00:15:45.472 --> 00:15:48.168
are present in the eternal
vision.

00:15:48.168 --> 00:15:51.173
Yet, that's not man's derive
necessity anymore than does a

00:15:51.173 --> 00:15:54.033
ship that dropped--
is there some autonomy to

00:15:54.033 --> 00:15:58.032
contingency or things determined
by the order of necessity

00:15:58.032 --> 00:16:01.330
downstream from the icing which
is mirrored.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.730
"From thence as sweet
harmony,"

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.428
last time I mentioned it
musical language,

00:16:06.428 --> 00:16:10.000
musical lexicon abounds here,
"comes from an organ to

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.437
the ear,
comes to my sight the time that

00:16:13.437 --> 00:16:15.918
is in store for thee."
 

00:16:15.918 --> 00:16:21.234
I enjoy very much the implicit
connection between time and

00:16:21.234 --> 00:16:21.980
music.
 

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:32.370
Music becoming the metaphor
that makes audible time itself.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:37.807
Time is constitutive of music
of course but it really makes

00:16:37.807 --> 00:16:41.613
it--
it's an acoustic translation of

00:16:41.613 --> 00:16:47.158
the silent arrow of time and now
this is the other,

00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:50.460
the third mythological
reference, Anchises,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.764
the tragic of Anchises who
recognizes himself in the

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:58.586
history and in the break,
in the continuity with his

00:16:58.586 --> 00:17:01.500
father and in the break with
Troy from his father,

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.679
from Troy and the beginning of
a new,

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:05.750
let's say, history.
 

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:10.211
Phaeton, who turns against his
father and burns the heavens in

00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:14.452
doing so, that is the famous
metamorphosis of the origin of

00:17:14.452 --> 00:17:15.769
the Milky Way.
 

00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:18.863
As you know,
the Milky Way was understood as

00:17:18.863 --> 00:17:22.907
the scorched heavens,
a cosmological disaster that

00:17:22.907 --> 00:17:28.288
was happening on account of the
rivalry between father and son,

00:17:28.288 --> 00:17:31.680
and now the third is
Hippolytus, Hippolytus,

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.478
the Ephedra,
the story of Ephedra and I have

00:17:34.478 --> 00:17:35.390
to tell you.
 

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.593
"As Hippolytus was driven
from Athens on account of his

00:17:40.593 --> 00:17:47.334
cruel and perfidious stepmother,
so must thou be driven from

00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:49.500
Florence."
 

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:54.449
This is Cacciaguida who
announces the exile as the

00:17:54.449 --> 00:18:00.407
fatality that is hovering over
Dante and for which he has to

00:18:00.407 --> 00:18:05.885
prepare himself and exile--
you see what it implies also a

00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:09.720
sort of necessary detachment
from one's family,

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.894
one's country,
one's whole--all the possible

00:18:13.894 --> 00:18:18.358
lines that tend to join us and
limit us too.

00:18:18.358 --> 00:18:22.542
Dante is not quite Anchises,
he's not out to establish an

00:18:22.542 --> 00:18:25.704
empire,
he's not like the Phaeton,

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:30.904
he does not want to overdo,
at least literally the father,

00:18:30.904 --> 00:18:34.078
and now let's see who is
Hippolytus,

00:18:34.078 --> 00:18:37.452
"As Hippolytus was driven
from Athens on account of his

00:18:37.452 --> 00:18:39.566
cruel and perfidious
stepmother,"

00:18:39.566 --> 00:18:42.471
Phaedra,
"so must thou be driven

00:18:42.471 --> 00:18:43.630
from Florence.
 

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.490
This is determined,
nay is already contrived,"

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.970
look at the difference between
determine and contrived,

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:56.779
and the conjunction between the
order of eternal,

00:18:56.779 --> 00:19:01.240
the eternal destinies and the
contrivance,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.440
the order of contingency,
the maneuvers,

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.568
infernal maneuvers against the
pilgrim,

00:19:07.568 --> 00:19:11.201
"and will soon be
accomplished by him who

00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:16.044
meditates it in the place where
Christ is bought and sold all

00:19:16.044 --> 00:19:16.690
day.
 

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:20.321
The blame, in the common cry,
shall follow the injured side,

00:19:20.321 --> 00:19:23.954
as always, but the vengeance
shall be testimony to the truth

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.308
that dispenses it.
 

00:19:25.308 --> 00:19:28.798
Thou," that's the
announcement of the exile,

00:19:28.798 --> 00:19:31.568
"Thou shalt leave
everything loved most dearly,

00:19:31.568 --> 00:19:35.779
and this is the shaft which the
bow of exile shoots first.

00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:41.223
Thou shalt prove how salt is
the taste of another man's bread

00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:46.670
and how hard is the way up and
down another man's salary--

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.170
another man's stairs."
 

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:50.855
Excuse me.
 

00:19:50.855 --> 00:19:54.349
Here there is a terrible
mistake that Sinclair makes

00:19:54.349 --> 00:19:59.144
because Dante is very careful,
line 60 he writes,

00:19:59.144 --> 00:20:06.130
lo scendere e 'l salir per
l'altrui scale,

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:11.490
which means going down and up
and your translator--

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.443
my translator here has it the
other way around because he's

00:20:15.443 --> 00:20:19.853
following a logic which is--
we'll call it naturalistic

00:20:19.853 --> 00:20:20.490
logic.
 

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:26.660
You go to the palace of the
duke, you go up,

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.938
you climb the stairs,
and then you come down after

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:34.019
you have been begging for some
charity and then you have taken

00:20:34.019 --> 00:20:36.690
your morsel of bread,
then you can go down.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.410
But that's not what Dante says.
 

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:41.710
He says you first go down and
then you go up,

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:47.298
and I hesitate to gloss it for
you because I think it's a

00:20:47.298 --> 00:20:53.086
little bit clear the kind of
thing he means that for him to

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:58.068
go up is really a descent,
was lowering himself.

00:20:58.068 --> 00:21:01.076
It's a little bit of--it would
seem to be a descent into

00:21:01.076 --> 00:21:03.346
pride--
into humility but at the same

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.288
time because he's reversing the
natural order,

00:21:06.288 --> 00:21:08.940
the ordinary order of the
action;

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.490
it's really an ascent into
pride.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:17.903
For me to go up here is--it's
like going down and I'm really

00:21:17.903 --> 00:21:19.970
degrading myself.
 

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:24.510
It's a very interesting line,
acknowledgement of a sense of

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:28.154
gratitude,
a sense of the spiritual ascent

00:21:28.154 --> 00:21:32.559
being inevitably at first a
descent into the self,

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:34.568
and then becoming an ascent.
 

00:21:34.568 --> 00:21:37.529
It's really--turns the whole
thing around,

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:40.010
was up and down,
another man's stairs and

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:43.671
"that which shall weigh
heaviest on thy shoulder is the

00:21:43.671 --> 00:21:47.330
wicked and senseless company
with which thou shall fall into

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.786
that valley,
which shall become wholly

00:21:49.786 --> 00:21:52.034
ungrateful,
quite mad and furious against

00:21:52.034 --> 00:21:52.690
thee."
 

00:21:52.690 --> 00:22:00.380
The story of Hippolytus is the
story of the stepmother,

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:05.199
to go back to this idea of
self, is the story of a

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:09.920
stepmother who is trying to
seduce Hippolytus;

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.940
she's married to Theseus,
and he runs away.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:19.253
The family becoming the
destructive--the form of the

00:22:19.253 --> 00:22:25.507
destructive desires within that
family forces him to go away,

00:22:25.507 --> 00:22:27.798
run away and dies.
 

00:22:27.798 --> 00:22:34.131
You wonder why Dante is taking
on and thinking of this tragic

00:22:34.131 --> 00:22:38.880
figure to compare himself too as
an exile,

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.006
he had this potentially
destructive and tragic

00:22:42.006 --> 00:22:45.410
consequences that are happening
to Hippolytus,

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:48.675
and at any rate,
we have three great images by

00:22:48.675 --> 00:22:53.031
which Dante is thinking about
what is the self and how is the

00:22:53.031 --> 00:22:54.920
self to be determined.
 

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.240
How does the self enter the
world of history?

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.078
What examples did he give?
 

00:23:01.078 --> 00:23:03.720
Can we talk about any of the
examples in the past?

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.838
I think that this is really the
extraordinary--

00:23:05.838 --> 00:23:09.722
the burden actually of a text
that I have been talking about

00:23:09.722 --> 00:23:12.948
in the past and it's the
Confessions of St.

00:23:12.948 --> 00:23:13.868
Augustine.
 

00:23:13.868 --> 00:23:18.584
That text is about the question
of how the self is related to

00:23:18.584 --> 00:23:22.118
history and Dante disagrees with
Augustine.

00:23:22.118 --> 00:23:25.868
For Augustine,
the self is one that takes

00:23:25.868 --> 00:23:30.650
refuge in the interiority of
oneself and goes on.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:35.515
At the time of the conversion
he can now rejoin history and

00:23:35.515 --> 00:23:39.792
that is thought--to Dante
clearly, a way of entering

00:23:39.792 --> 00:23:40.798
history.
 

00:23:40.798 --> 00:23:44.358
The other motif that you can
have is the motif of the--

00:23:44.358 --> 00:23:49.865
the other model you have is the
model of Cacciaguida who goes

00:23:49.865 --> 00:23:55.281
onto a self-sacrifice of himself
for the benefit of a larger

00:23:55.281 --> 00:23:56.200
cause.
 

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:01.250
The cause of the Christian
crusade in Jerusalem;

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:06.361
then there is the Aeneid
that represents the idea of how

00:24:06.361 --> 00:24:09.660
the self enters the world of
history,

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:15.117
its political activity and
Dante really sort of rejects all

00:24:15.117 --> 00:24:16.058
of them.
 

00:24:16.058 --> 00:24:22.282
This prophesy of exile with
which Canto XVII ends gives an

00:24:22.282 --> 00:24:29.380
entirely different twist to the
self's relationship to history.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.910
I--inevitably I will belong in
history.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.491
There is no other way,
Dante says, for the self to

00:24:36.491 --> 00:24:40.660
exist if not by measuring
oneself with the historical,

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.848
the pressures of historical
realities,

00:24:42.848 --> 00:24:46.548
but my own relationship to it
is not that--

00:24:46.548 --> 00:24:51.336
or that of belonging as Aeneas
does into the world of history

00:24:51.336 --> 00:24:56.724
with feeling that I am--
the political world is going to

00:24:56.724 --> 00:24:59.720
be my way out of this maze.
 

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.178
It's not going to be the one
like Phaeton and it's not going

00:25:03.178 --> 00:25:05.640
to be the one represented by
Hippolytus.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:11.067
It's the exilic self;
an idea of a self is an art of

00:25:11.067 --> 00:25:14.509
dislocation from the world of
history.

00:25:14.509 --> 00:25:17.640
But then how are we to
understand this dislocation?

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.848
Is dislocation a way of
actually removing oneself

00:25:21.848 --> 00:25:22.990
altogether?
 

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.588
Or just saying that I'm out of
place,

00:25:24.588 --> 00:25:28.355
just saying that I'm out of
time and somehow I have a

00:25:28.355 --> 00:25:32.118
relationship to history which is
maybe polemical,

00:25:32.118 --> 00:25:39.460
maybe arguably constructive and
if so what is the way?

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.022
I think that we have to reread
now the three cantos in some

00:25:43.022 --> 00:25:45.420
detail and we come up with an
answer.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.490
You see then what this--what
the issues here are.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:53.996
Let me start with Canto XV and
see what Dante is specifically

00:25:53.996 --> 00:25:58.769
doing above and beyond this
overall pattern that he's

00:25:58.769 --> 00:26:03.450
putting forth in canto-- in the
various cantos.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:07.989
You will see how in Canto XV
the--let's go back to Canto XV

00:26:07.989 --> 00:26:12.292
and you will see that the
relationship to Cacciaguida is

00:26:12.292 --> 00:26:14.720
also played etymologically.
 

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.240
How often Dante's punning with
the metaphor of wings;

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.269
in Italian it's ali,
Alighieri,

00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:26.358
Aligher, that was the name,
the bearers of wings so the--

00:26:26.358 --> 00:26:29.078
for instance line 52,
"I speak of thee,

00:26:29.078 --> 00:26:32.980
thanks to her who clad thee
with wings for the lofty

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.500
flight,"
or a little later on line 70,

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.317
"I turned to Beatrice,
and she heard before I spoke

00:26:39.317 --> 00:26:42.816
and smiled to me,
a sign that made the wings grow

00:26:42.816 --> 00:26:46.063
on my will,"
and later line 80 many,

00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:47.200
many times.
 

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.900
He stops after the third time.
 

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.351
"For the reason that is
plain to you,

00:26:51.351 --> 00:26:54.101
are not equally feathered in
their wings,"

00:26:54.101 --> 00:26:54.578
etc.
 

00:26:54.578 --> 00:26:57.588
The first thing that they do
though with the exchange--

00:26:57.588 --> 00:27:04.409
in the encounter with
Cacciaguida is focus on the City

00:27:04.409 --> 00:27:09.411
of Florence of old,
an invocation of the golden

00:27:09.411 --> 00:27:14.558
age, a certain golden age where
a kind of utopian construction.

00:27:14.558 --> 00:27:17.203
These are the lines,
"Florence,"

00:27:17.203 --> 00:27:21.077
page--
line--Canto XV lines 94-97 and

00:27:21.077 --> 00:27:23.452
following,
"Florence,

00:27:23.452 --> 00:27:27.742
within her ancient circle,
from which she still takes

00:27:27.742 --> 00:27:32.560
tierce and nones,"
these are the times of the day

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.470
rung by the bells of the nearby
church,

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:41.598
"abode in peace,
sober and chased.

00:27:41.598 --> 00:27:45.482
She had no bracelet,
no tiara, no embroidered gowns,

00:27:45.482 --> 00:27:49.519
no girdle that should be seen
more than the wearer.

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:53.449
Nor yet did the daughter at her
birth put the father in fear,

00:27:53.449 --> 00:27:57.442
for age and dowry did not part
from the due measure on the one

00:27:57.442 --> 00:27:58.950
side and the other.
 

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:03.330
She had no houses empty of
family, nor had Sardanapalus yet

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.940
come there to show what could be
done in the chamber."

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.838
This is a kind of
inferno--evocations,

00:28:12.838 --> 00:28:16.872
so these are--you are really
thinking of Cleopatra in Canto

00:28:16.872 --> 00:28:19.618
V,
you are thinking of Semiramis,

00:28:19.618 --> 00:28:24.338
all these figures of the chaos
of the appetites and they are

00:28:24.338 --> 00:28:28.818
being recalled now in this
context "Not yet did your

00:28:28.818 --> 00:28:31.538
Uccellatoio"
and so on,

00:28:31.538 --> 00:28:36.630
and goes on talking about
Cacciaguida's own birth.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:43.018
Let me focus a little bit on
this--the metaphors of the--of

00:28:43.018 --> 00:28:44.230
Florence.
 

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.015
First of all,
Florence is evoked within a

00:28:48.015 --> 00:28:52.934
closed circle of self
sufficiency called "within

00:28:52.934 --> 00:28:55.680
her ancient circle."
 

00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.446
The circularity of the city
also implies a kind of

00:29:00.446 --> 00:29:03.950
plentitude and a sort of
boundary.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:09.019
Dante does not have an idea of
an expanding city,

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:15.893
just he enjoys the--projects
this idea of a city held within

00:29:15.893 --> 00:29:20.271
its own perimeter,
"from which she still

00:29:20.271 --> 00:29:24.584
takes tierce and nones,"
the language of space and the

00:29:24.584 --> 00:29:28.316
language of time follows,
as if everything could be

00:29:28.316 --> 00:29:31.278
measured and everything could be
interrelated.

00:29:31.278 --> 00:29:32.910
One is interrelated with the
other.

00:29:34.848 --> 00:29:41.410
Then this language of--Florence
is a woman,

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:46.155
sober, chaste,
abode in peace,

00:29:46.155 --> 00:29:52.215
sober and chaste,
implying that here at least he

00:29:52.215 --> 00:29:57.603
believes and it's lingering in
him the memory of the famous

00:29:57.603 --> 00:30:02.990
idea of the so called body
politic that you have heard.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:07.532
The idea of the organic
structure of the city as made of

00:30:07.532 --> 00:30:12.076
interdependent parts just as
space and time indicate the

00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:16.538
interdependent coordinates
within which the life of the

00:30:16.538 --> 00:30:18.769
city can be recalled.
 

00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:23.509
Now--this is followed in turn
by a sequence of Anaphorus,

00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:26.380
all in the negatives,
"she had no bracelet,

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.029
no tiara,"
this is the city,

00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:30.578
dressed like a woman."
 

00:30:30.578 --> 00:30:36.141
Dante--you know that one way of
thinking about cosmetics is also

00:30:36.141 --> 00:30:39.798
to think of it--
they used to think of cosmetics

00:30:39.798 --> 00:30:44.021
as bad rhetoric,
perverse forms of seduction by

00:30:44.021 --> 00:30:49.664
means of which one could
disfigure the natural continents

00:30:49.664 --> 00:30:52.890
and beauty of the human form.
 

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:56.348
So Dante goes on in a sense by
repeating these negatives,

00:30:56.348 --> 00:31:00.007
literally dispossessing,
literally stripping the woman

00:31:00.007 --> 00:31:04.544
of all the superfluities,
all these complications and

00:31:04.544 --> 00:31:08.788
bring the city back to its own
simplicity,

00:31:08.788 --> 00:31:11.970
its original chastity and
simplicity--

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:15.548
let me just see this passage,
"She had no tiara,

00:31:15.548 --> 00:31:18.349
no embroidered gowns,
no girdle, not yet did the

00:31:18.349 --> 00:31:21.210
daughter at her birth put the
father in fear,

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.470
as she had no houses
empty," etc.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:28.180
This is the golden age.
 

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.989
Does Dante really believe
though in this myth of the

00:31:31.989 --> 00:31:32.960
golden age?
 

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:38.480
This is what we call--there is
a rhetorical phrase for this

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.910
sort of move.
 

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:45.077
Praising the bygone times,
it's the so-called

00:31:45.077 --> 00:31:51.327
laudatio,
that means praise of the past,

00:31:51.327 --> 00:31:58.426
which is more of a rhetorical
strategy to denounce the

00:31:58.426 --> 00:32:01.910
imperfections of today.
 

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:06.180
In effect, Dante has a
radically polemical view of the

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.548
utopian spirit.
 

00:32:07.548 --> 00:32:11.217
This idea of a perfection
that--or the claim of a

00:32:11.217 --> 00:32:15.570
perfection that we push back
into the past because it's no

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:19.413
longer with us,
but we want to fantasize about

00:32:19.413 --> 00:32:23.732
and nonetheless he is still--
he preserves it because utopia

00:32:23.732 --> 00:32:27.672
can become a kind of normative
idea by means of which we can

00:32:27.672 --> 00:32:30.876
alter the configuration of our
own contingencies,

00:32:30.876 --> 00:32:32.278
our own history.
 

00:32:32.278 --> 00:32:35.395
It may--utopias don't exist,
they may even be dangerous some

00:32:35.395 --> 00:32:36.400
people can claim.
 

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.977
A lot of interesting figures in
the history of ideas claim that

00:32:40.977 --> 00:32:44.445
utopias are dangerous
constructions because they

00:32:44.445 --> 00:32:47.400
ferment illusions about who we
are,

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.750
and yet they become for Dante
necessary because we--

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:55.742
in the light of those ideas we
can go on altering what we

00:32:55.742 --> 00:33:00.880
perceive as the degradations of
our own times.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:05.691
Of course this myth of the
golden age of Florence of the

00:33:05.691 --> 00:33:10.766
past literally disintegrates
when seen in contrast with the

00:33:10.766 --> 00:33:15.839
reality of Dante's life as an
exile which is going to await

00:33:15.839 --> 00:33:17.940
him in the future.
 

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:21.791
That is going to be--so it's
exile as the realistic

00:33:21.791 --> 00:33:24.720
perspective of his being in
history.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.318
He makes a virtue of it.
 

00:33:27.318 --> 00:33:29.778
It's not a suffering as we are
going to see,

00:33:29.778 --> 00:33:32.578
I'm just--let me just continue
with my thought.

00:33:32.578 --> 00:33:36.152
He doesn't see that as a
punishment, it induces

00:33:36.152 --> 00:33:40.578
suffering, but it becomes a
virtue and we shall see why it

00:33:40.578 --> 00:33:42.210
becomes a virtue.
 

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:45.567
In effect, it will become a
paradigm in which we can all

00:33:45.567 --> 00:33:46.910
recognize ourselves.
 

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:51.377
In Canto XVI this myth
of--there's also this golden age

00:33:51.377 --> 00:33:54.491
of Florence,
there's this illusion that it

00:33:54.491 --> 00:33:56.967
abode in peace,
they lived in peace,

00:33:56.967 --> 00:34:00.410
whenever I hear the language of
peace I do hear,

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:02.900
I do overhear the echo of
Jerusalem,

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.664
the city of peace,
and that's what makes it

00:34:06.664 --> 00:34:10.773
interesting,
so it's a typology of another

00:34:10.773 --> 00:34:14.244
city,
a golden--the great time,

00:34:14.244 --> 00:34:18.960
the golden age of the past is a
kind of--

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.945
what the prophets would always
recall as the peace time of

00:34:24.945 --> 00:34:30.295
Jerusalem that they had--
that the Jews themselves had

00:34:30.295 --> 00:34:34.518
lost and kept on commemorating
in the history.

00:34:34.518 --> 00:34:39.507
What makes this conjunction
very strong is that--to me is

00:34:39.507 --> 00:34:43.516
that in Canto XVI Dante goes on,
first of all,

00:34:43.516 --> 00:34:47.170
talking about this at the
chronicles.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:48.429
What is a chronicle?
 

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:51.518
How does the chronicle change
history?

00:34:51.518 --> 00:34:57.005
The chronicle reduces--it's a
mode of historiography,

00:34:57.005 --> 00:35:00.909
a different mode of
historiography.

00:35:00.909 --> 00:35:07.101
The place where you can find
these modalities of history is

00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:11.882
really Boethius,
who writes the Consolation

00:35:11.882 --> 00:35:16.380
of Philosophy,
at the center of which he

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.500
figures the Wheel of Fortune.
 

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.768
You remember the Wheel of
Fortune;

00:35:21.768 --> 00:35:26.679
there's this blindfolded woman
who revolves,

00:35:26.679 --> 00:35:30.590
who rotates this wheel,
and which means that we who are

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:35.300
always on the shifting curve of
the wheel will be up and down,

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:39.056
so that a kind of
historiography that derives from

00:35:39.056 --> 00:35:43.733
this Boethian insight is that of
writing the lives of families

00:35:43.733 --> 00:35:45.880
that ascend and descend.
 

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.143
Note, the other mode of
historiography,

00:35:49.143 --> 00:35:53.523
should be the historiography of
the fall of empires,

00:35:53.523 --> 00:35:55.929
for instance,
Augustine.

00:35:55.929 --> 00:35:57.880
So there are two
historiographic models.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.989
The one that you--available in
the City of God,

00:35:59.989 --> 00:36:03.000
we are really told about the
fall of the Persian Empire,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.800
the fall of the Roman Empire in
a few pages,

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.219
kind of given sort of in a much
more detailed way,

00:36:10.219 --> 00:36:11.849
but this is really the idea.
 

00:36:11.849 --> 00:36:13.920
On the other hand,
Dante goes to another

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.630
historiographic model which is
that of chronicle.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:21.018
The idea that history is
reducible to the events,

00:36:21.018 --> 00:36:26.050
the local events and
circumstances of one's own life.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.643
He recalls all the families to
the joy of the grandfather who

00:36:29.643 --> 00:36:32.518
is--you can understand the
pleasure of memory.

00:36:32.518 --> 00:36:35.929
He shuttles back and forth
between,

00:36:35.929 --> 00:36:39.730
in memory, between one item and
the other,

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:44.023
recalling everything and Dante
soon discovers that he does not

00:36:44.023 --> 00:36:47.307
quite belong,
that that kind of history does

00:36:47.307 --> 00:36:51.623
not really account for who he is
and who he wants to be above

00:36:51.623 --> 00:36:54.273
all,
and that somehow his definition

00:36:54.273 --> 00:36:58.356
of self will depend on a certain
idea of the future and not of

00:36:58.356 --> 00:36:59.159
the past.
 

00:36:59.159 --> 00:37:04.173
I am trying to go back to this
idea of who the self is and what

00:37:04.173 --> 00:37:08.300
is history, and how are we to
understand history.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.260
Here, to continue with the
notion of Jerusalem,

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:14.804
which I have not--which I
bracketed a little bit and gave

00:37:14.804 --> 00:37:17.210
you a little digression on
history,

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.250
Dante goes on talking about a
language,

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:24.869
turn to Canto XVI line 50
please where he again talks

00:37:24.869 --> 00:37:27.610
about--
it's all about Florence.

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:32.101
"All who were there at the
time between Mars and the

00:37:32.101 --> 00:37:35.630
Baptist,"
the mythology of Florence,

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:41.010
cities, not only you recount
stories of families,

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.630
you have to recount stories of
the predominant,

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:47.695
the sovereignty of mythologies
that control our own self

00:37:47.695 --> 00:37:48.880
understanding.
 

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:53.230
We tend to understand ourselves
in the light of presiding myths,

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:57.315
of imaginative myths above us,
so there's Mars who's the god

00:37:57.315 --> 00:38:01.730
of Florence before the Baptist,
John the Baptist replaced him.

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:05.768
This is the account about the
shifting mythology of the city,

00:38:05.768 --> 00:38:08.532
"Mars the Baptist able to
bear arms was a fifth of the

00:38:08.532 --> 00:38:11.250
number now living,"
this is really an accounting,

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:18.081
a chronicler's precision and
accounting of Florentine local

00:38:18.081 --> 00:38:19.260
history.
 

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.420
"But the citizenship,
which is now mixed with Campi

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.750
and Certaldo and Figline,"
and so on.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:30.833
That language of mixture which
later becomes confusion and

00:38:30.833 --> 00:38:35.204
Dante will call it a confusion
when he has to give a diagnosis

00:38:35.204 --> 00:38:37.570
at the top of page-- line 67.
 

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:41.192
Dante has to give a--goes into
a diagnosis of the crisis of the

00:38:41.192 --> 00:38:43.541
city,
"The mixture of peoples

00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:46.500
was ever the beginning of the
city's ills,

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.699
as food in excess is of the
body's."

00:38:49.699 --> 00:38:53.273
Once again the connection
between--he's talking about the

00:38:53.273 --> 00:38:56.657
malaise of the city by the
connection between body and

00:38:56.657 --> 00:38:57.360
cities.
 

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.947
Cities grow and decay and get
sick because of what he calls

00:39:02.947 --> 00:39:04.489
the confusion.
 

00:39:04.489 --> 00:39:07.014
First of all he called the
mixture, en confusio,

00:39:07.014 --> 00:39:08.510
is the other name for Babylon.
 

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:13.735
When you have to etymologize
Babylon into the romance

00:39:13.735 --> 00:39:17.826
languages and in English,
it's confusion,

00:39:17.826 --> 00:39:22.760
so that the two myths of the
city that Dante has in mind is

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:28.289
Jerusalem for Florence and then
Babylon for Florence of today.

00:39:28.289 --> 00:39:34.059
The two myths of the cities are
not antithetical;

00:39:34.059 --> 00:39:38.659
they are both possible within
the same body politic.

00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:43.141
Florence can look like
Jerusalem or it can look like

00:39:43.141 --> 00:39:48.677
Babylon according to the way the
moral life of the city is lived

00:39:48.677 --> 00:39:49.380
out.
 

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.389
This is something that Dante
will preserve,

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:55.059
but it really implies that the
city,

00:39:55.059 --> 00:40:00.737
the political world is one
which one has to shape all the

00:40:00.737 --> 00:40:03.934
time,
that you cannot--there is no

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:08.789
definite metaphor or emblem to
define a particular city.

00:40:08.789 --> 00:40:12.019
A city can change its very
identity, it can become like--it

00:40:12.019 --> 00:40:15.418
can be like a Jerusalem as it
was in the old or it can be like

00:40:15.418 --> 00:40:16.309
Babylon now.
 

00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:20.635
The city involves us,
we are involved in the city's

00:40:20.635 --> 00:40:25.047
history in the way of making it
according to our own

00:40:25.047 --> 00:40:30.190
aspirations, our own ideas;
we share in the shaping and

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:32.559
construction of the city.
 

00:40:32.559 --> 00:40:35.559
This is no longer the
perspective of the chronicler,

00:40:35.559 --> 00:40:38.150
it's the perspective of Dante
as the poet;

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:42.902
so it's a critique of the
inadequacy of the chronicle's

00:40:42.902 --> 00:40:45.719
view of what history could be.
 

00:40:45.719 --> 00:40:51.873
Now we go back to Canto XVII
where once again and I'm going

00:40:51.873 --> 00:40:54.333
to--
I will not go up to our--you

00:40:54.333 --> 00:40:58.239
remember it comes to Phaeton and
a rivalry with the father.

00:40:58.239 --> 00:41:03.000
Dante's saying if I don't
belong to the city and I--

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.378
and city and families go on
decaying and disappearing what

00:41:06.378 --> 00:41:10.112
is the true relationship that I
have to this man who is actually

00:41:10.112 --> 00:41:13.547
directing me,
and unveiling for me that which

00:41:13.547 --> 00:41:16.791
the future--
that which I have to expect

00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:18.210
from the future.
 

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:22.900
These are the kind of questions
that he's very carefully

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:28.445
raising,
so we go back to the famous

00:41:28.445 --> 00:41:37.659
description of Dante's exile
where we describe here,

00:41:37.659 --> 00:41:40.918
"Thou shalt leave
everything loved most

00:41:40.918 --> 00:41:42.889
dearly,"
lines 55,

00:41:42.889 --> 00:41:46.206
"loved most dearly,
and this is the shaft which the

00:41:46.206 --> 00:41:48.322
bow,
the bow of exile shoots

00:41:48.322 --> 00:41:49.280
first."
 

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:55.235
The condition,
the harshness of exile could

00:41:55.235 --> 00:42:00.909
not be crystallized in sharpest
terms.

00:42:00.909 --> 00:42:04.347
The severance,
the separation of self from

00:42:04.347 --> 00:42:08.789
family as apparently as a
punishment at this point.

00:42:08.789 --> 00:42:13.346
"Thou shalt prove how salt
is the taste of another man's

00:42:13.346 --> 00:42:14.409
bread."
 

00:42:14.409 --> 00:42:19.371
Those who think that here Dante
is finding a little bit mildly

00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:24.170
comical relief in remembering
the fact that in Florence they

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:29.599
do not use salt in their bread,
but anywhere else around we

00:42:29.599 --> 00:42:35.248
have a frequent flyer to Italy
who knows very well this little

00:42:35.248 --> 00:42:37.757
history,
but I don't think that it's all

00:42:37.757 --> 00:42:38.389
that comical.
 

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:43.532
I think it's the bread,
it's the most sacramental of

00:42:43.532 --> 00:42:49.282
foods that he's talking about
and then we shall see how he

00:42:49.282 --> 00:42:53.619
picks up the idea of bread in a
moment.

00:42:53.619 --> 00:42:57.706
It's just not a metaphor there,
"Thou shall--and how hard

00:42:57.706 --> 00:43:00.789
is the way up and down another
man's stairs.

00:43:00.789 --> 00:43:04.688
And that which shall weigh
heaviest on thy shoulder is the

00:43:04.688 --> 00:43:07.219
wicked and senseless
company."

00:43:07.219 --> 00:43:11.893
The word picks up the metaphor
of the bread because company

00:43:11.893 --> 00:43:15.061
means,
and that which--it simply means

00:43:15.061 --> 00:43:17.820
the sharing of bread with
others,

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:22.585
so bread is truly sacramental
in the sense that it adjoins and

00:43:22.585 --> 00:43:27.039
brings about the unity of the
body of the body politic.

00:43:27.039 --> 00:43:31.445
What Dante's saying is that
it's a reflection on his own

00:43:31.445 --> 00:43:35.050
life, a literal reflection of
his own life.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:38.530
He went into exile as you know
in the year 1302,

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:42.726
and for a number of years he
went on at least two or three

00:43:42.726 --> 00:43:45.983
years,
plotting along the side of his

00:43:45.983 --> 00:43:51.260
other fellow exiles the return
to Florence and the destruction

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.719
of the enemies who had banished
them.

00:43:54.719 --> 00:43:59.800
Really a plot of revenge in
order to restore what they saw

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.960
as justice.
 

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.106
Dante very quickly understood
that this was the way to

00:44:05.106 --> 00:44:09.016
absolute destruction,
so he just from then on moves

00:44:09.016 --> 00:44:11.130
like a shabby derelict.
 

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.460
He represents himself limping
at the beginning of

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:18.070
Inferno and that is
really the way we can--

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:21.284
we are asked by him to imagine
him as he goes when he's talking

00:44:21.284 --> 00:44:22.010
about exile.
 

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:26.322
We are not talking about living
in some kind of isolated

00:44:26.322 --> 00:44:28.989
splendor in some court or other.
 

00:44:28.989 --> 00:44:32.699
It literally means going from
place to place begging,

00:44:32.699 --> 00:44:35.429
so this is punishment for him,
and yet,

00:44:35.429 --> 00:44:38.643
let's see what happens,
"With which thou shalt

00:44:38.643 --> 00:44:42.630
fall into that valley which
shall become wholly ungrateful,

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.960
quite mad and furious against
thee."

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.860
He is an exile to the exiles.
 

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:52.514
Both the Guelfs and Ghibellines
distrust him and take their

00:44:52.514 --> 00:44:55.389
distance from him,
"but before long they,

00:44:55.389 --> 00:44:58.559
not thou shall have the brows
red for this.

00:44:58.559 --> 00:45:02.690
Of their brutish folly their
doings shall give proof,

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:07.298
so that it shall be to thine
honour to have made a party by

00:45:07.298 --> 00:45:08.730
thyself."
 

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:12.030
What an extraordinary line to
be absolutely on your own,

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.010
"a party to thyself."
 

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:19.230
This should make you--should
give you some perplexity,

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:22.795
to say the least,
because you may remember that

00:45:22.795 --> 00:45:27.523
the Divine Comedy begins
with the representation of the

00:45:27.523 --> 00:45:32.163
so called neutral angels,
and those neutral angels were

00:45:32.163 --> 00:45:36.869
angels who wanted to be neither
with God nor against God,

00:45:36.869 --> 00:45:39.190
but they want to be by
themselves.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:42.708
You remember how I pointed that
out to you, that for Dante this

00:45:42.708 --> 00:45:45.489
was the most despicable of
conditions and choices,

00:45:45.489 --> 00:45:47.590
though it seems to be
non-choice.

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:51.610
One is really choosing anyway,
even when we are not choosing

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:55.338
we are choosing and he is;
he was separating that to him

00:45:55.338 --> 00:45:58.724
it's despicable not to take
sides, to sit on the fence,

00:45:58.724 --> 00:46:02.739
and now he seems to attribute
that very condition to himself.

00:46:02.739 --> 00:46:07.750
But to you it will be to your
honor to be a party to thyself,

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:11.387
and not only--we did not read
it, but those of you who were so

00:46:11.387 --> 00:46:14.041
taken with the poem,
you can go and read Canto VIII

00:46:14.041 --> 00:46:16.612
of Paradise,
where Dante will ask one

00:46:16.612 --> 00:46:20.833
question he--
to the soul that he meets he

00:46:20.833 --> 00:46:27.440
says, is it right for a man in
the city to be a citizen?

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.867
Yes, he says,
and I don't even want to ask

00:46:30.867 --> 00:46:33.601
why;
it's so clear that has--it

00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:36.724
needs no justification,
no explanation,

00:46:36.724 --> 00:46:40.492
you have to be part of the--
belong to the world where you

00:46:40.492 --> 00:46:43.219
are, and yet now he takes the
other side.

00:46:43.219 --> 00:46:45.199
He has to be by himself.
 

00:46:45.199 --> 00:46:47.699
What does it mean to be by
himself?

00:46:47.699 --> 00:46:50.159
Is that a kind of neutrality
he's imagining?

00:46:50.159 --> 00:46:53.289
Is that--it's really the
condition of exile I think that

00:46:53.289 --> 00:46:55.679
he's really describing the
destitution,

00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:59.983
the loneliness,
the severance of the self from

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:02.730
others,
but even that can become a

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:06.309
condition that triggers a new
form of relationship.

00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:11.467
The exile is still part of the
community and let's see how he

00:47:11.467 --> 00:47:13.360
is thinking of this.
 

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:21.628
I don't want to--this is
his--this is now the specific

00:47:21.628 --> 00:47:28.650
prophecy of what's in store for
the exiled.

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:33.128
I think it retrieves,
in this sense I mean that

00:47:33.128 --> 00:47:38.288
Dante's bringing about a
transformation of the idea of

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:44.130
exile from what seemed to be a
punishment into a virtue.

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:47.360
There is such a thing as a
virtue of exile.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:51.507
The language with which Dante
presents the world to come for

00:47:51.507 --> 00:47:54.211
him,
the future, this is his future,

00:47:54.211 --> 00:47:58.746
it's not the past,
history then is understood as

00:47:58.746 --> 00:48:00.889
above all futurity.
 

00:48:00.889 --> 00:48:04.199
We are here oriented to the
future,

00:48:04.199 --> 00:48:07.980
the only real time that we
have, we don't have it yet,

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.300
but we can--it's the time of
one's projects,

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:15.610
it's the time in which one can
really define oneself.

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:17.719
I'm not really my past so there
is--

00:48:17.719 --> 00:48:20.373
I have some contact with the
past, my memories and my

00:48:20.373 --> 00:48:23.329
memories can tell you--
me where I'm going but then a

00:48:23.329 --> 00:48:24.489
catastrophe occurs.
 

00:48:24.489 --> 00:48:28.989
The need to sever yourself from
anything that you know,

00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:31.539
and you love most dearly --
family,

00:48:31.539 --> 00:48:33.844
city, loyalties,
your habits,

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:37.324
your bread --
all of these details here are

00:48:37.324 --> 00:48:39.880
given and this is what he finds.
 

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.565
"Thy first refuge,
and inn,"

00:48:43.565 --> 00:48:48.744
the inn as those of you who
read, it's an interesting

00:48:48.744 --> 00:48:52.730
metaphor in the medieval
literature.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:55.297
Those of you who read Chaucer,
is there anybody here who reads

00:48:55.297 --> 00:48:55.719
Chaucer?
 

00:48:55.719 --> 00:48:59.659
The Canterbury Tales,
of course,

00:48:59.659 --> 00:49:05.059
it's the story of pilgrims and
the inn becomes the station--

00:49:05.059 --> 00:49:09.242
the temporary dwelling of
people who are on the road and

00:49:09.242 --> 00:49:10.460
always moving.
 

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:14.242
It's really one of the most
welcome images in the medieval

00:49:14.242 --> 00:49:17.492
imagination, the inn,
the provisional comforts for

00:49:17.492 --> 00:49:19.750
the night that the inn offers.
 

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:23.780
Anyway, "'Thy first refuge
and inn thou shalt find in the

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:26.094
courtesy of the great
Lombard,"

00:49:26.094 --> 00:49:28.539
this is the gentleman of
Verona,

00:49:28.539 --> 00:49:32.835
the one gentleman of Verona who
houses him and hosted him for a

00:49:32.835 --> 00:49:35.119
while,
"who bears on the ladder

00:49:35.119 --> 00:49:37.833
the sacred bird,
and he will hold thee in so

00:49:37.833 --> 00:49:41.297
gracious regard that,
of doing and asking between you

00:49:41.297 --> 00:49:44.358
two,
that shall be first which with

00:49:44.358 --> 00:49:46.050
others come after.
 

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:50.583
With him thou shalt see one who
at his birth so took the impress

00:49:50.583 --> 00:49:54.469
of this mighty star that his
deeds will be renowned.

00:49:54.469 --> 00:49:57.356
The people have not yet taken
note of him, because of his

00:49:57.356 --> 00:50:00.193
youth, for these wheels have
circled about him only nine

00:50:00.193 --> 00:50:02.858
years;
but before the Gascon deceives

00:50:02.858 --> 00:50:06.867
the noble Henry sparks of his
heroism shall appear in his

00:50:06.867 --> 00:50:09.590
disregard both of wealth and
toil,

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:13.177
and his munificence shall yet
be known so that his enemies

00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:15.130
cannot keep silence about it.
 

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:18.389
Look to him and to his benefits.
 

00:50:18.389 --> 00:50:21.503
Through him there shall be
altered fortune for many,

00:50:21.503 --> 00:50:23.639
rich changing state with
beggars.

00:50:23.639 --> 00:50:26.574
And thou shalt bear this
written in thy mind about him

00:50:26.574 --> 00:50:29.436
and shalt not tell it,'--
and he told things which shall

00:50:29.436 --> 00:50:31.349
be incredible to those that
witness them.

00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:34.643
Then he added:
'Son, these are the glosses on

00:50:34.643 --> 00:50:39.059
what was told thee,"
in Inferno XV of course.

00:50:39.059 --> 00:50:43.945
Remember when Brunetto says,
"This is the prophecy of

00:50:43.945 --> 00:50:49.003
your future exile but it will be
glossed for you by somebody

00:50:49.003 --> 00:50:50.289
else."
 

00:50:50.289 --> 00:50:52.628
He doesn't even mention who,
Dante goes on thinking that

00:50:52.628 --> 00:50:56.143
it's going to be Beatrice;
it turns out to be his father,

00:50:56.143 --> 00:50:57.230
his ancestor.
 

00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:00.536
"These are the snares that
are hid behind a few revolving

00:51:00.536 --> 00:51:02.398
years;
yet I would not have thee

00:51:02.398 --> 00:51:05.882
envious of thy fellow-citizens,
for thy life shall far outlast

00:51:05.882 --> 00:51:08.340
the punishment of the
perfidies.'"

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:12.349
The exile can turn into a
virtue and the language here

00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:17.193
that accompanies this prediction
is the language of the ethics of

00:51:17.193 --> 00:51:17.949
exile.
 

00:51:17.949 --> 00:51:24.032
That the exile brings about and
needs in order to be bearable

00:51:24.032 --> 00:51:27.380
and tolerable,
the hospitality.

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.536
These are the great,
the courtesy,

00:51:29.536 --> 00:51:32.659
the hospitality,
the language of gratitude,

00:51:32.659 --> 00:51:35.681
the giving,
so it's a new ethics is going

00:51:35.681 --> 00:51:39.965
to be described in--
from the perspective of this

00:51:39.965 --> 00:51:42.739
exilic experience of Dante.
 

00:51:42.739 --> 00:51:48.032
Then Dante concludes,
which I think it seals what I

00:51:48.032 --> 00:51:51.514
have been saying,
"'I see well my

00:51:51.514 --> 00:51:54.719
father,"
this is line 113 and following,

00:51:54.719 --> 00:51:57.208
110 and following,
"'I see well,

00:51:57.208 --> 00:52:00.871
my father, how time spurs
towards me to deal me such a

00:52:00.871 --> 00:52:05.018
blow as falls most heavily on
him that is most heedless;

00:52:05.018 --> 00:52:07.771
it is well, therefore,
that I arm me with

00:52:07.771 --> 00:52:11.280
foresight,'"
that's another virtue of exile.

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.599
The word translates,
of course, prudence.

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:20.849
Prudence is the human
counterpart of providence.

00:52:20.849 --> 00:52:24.429
It's the same etymology,
a seeing in advance,

00:52:24.429 --> 00:52:28.632
trying to not predict but
forestall the arrows and flings

00:52:28.632 --> 00:52:31.920
that come our way,
"so that if the dearest

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.628
place is taken from me,
I may not lose the others by my

00:52:35.628 --> 00:52:36.119
songs.
 

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:39.518
Down through the world of
endless bitterness,

00:52:39.518 --> 00:52:42.742
and on the mountain from whose
fair summit the eyes of my Lady

00:52:42.742 --> 00:52:44.918
lifted me,
and after, through the heavens

00:52:44.918 --> 00:52:47.137
from light to light,
I have learned that which,

00:52:47.137 --> 00:52:50.367
if I tell again,
will taste for many of bitter

00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:53.605
herbs;
and if I am a timid friend to

00:52:53.605 --> 00:52:58.987
truth I fear to lose my life
among those who will call these

00:52:58.987 --> 00:53:00.539
times ancient.
 

00:53:00.539 --> 00:53:03.606
' The light within which was
smiling the treasure,"

00:53:03.606 --> 00:53:06.396
and then of the reference to
Brunetto who wrote the

00:53:06.396 --> 00:53:08.070
Treasure of course.
 

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:11.451
"I had found there first
became ablaze like a golden

00:53:11.451 --> 00:53:13.525
mirror in the sun,
then replied:

00:53:13.525 --> 00:53:17.188
'Conscience dark with its own
or another's shame will indeed

00:53:17.188 --> 00:53:20.942
feel thy words to be harsh;
but none the less put away

00:53:20.942 --> 00:53:25.164
every falsehood and make plain
all thy vision--and then let

00:53:25.164 --> 00:53:27.639
them scratch where is the itch.
 

00:53:27.639 --> 00:53:32.088
For if thy voice is grievous at
first taste, it will afterwards

00:53:32.088 --> 00:53:35.389
leave vital nourishment when it
is digested.

00:53:35.389 --> 00:53:38.364
This cry of thine shall do as
does the wind,

00:53:38.364 --> 00:53:41.409
which strikes most on the
highest summits;

00:53:41.409 --> 00:53:44.469
and that is no small ground of
honour.

00:53:44.469 --> 00:53:47.697
For that reason have been shown
to thee, in these wheels,

00:53:47.697 --> 00:53:50.059
on the mountain,
and in the woeful valley,

00:53:50.059 --> 00:53:52.250
only souls that are known to
fame;

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:55.597
because the mind of one who
hears will not pause or fix its

00:53:55.597 --> 00:53:59.001
faith for an example that has
its roots unknown or hidden or

00:53:59.001 --> 00:54:01.829
for other proof that it not
manifest.'"

00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:05.690
What he hears,
and the decision that Dante

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:11.246
will take as a palliative at
least, or a remedy to his exile

00:54:11.246 --> 00:54:12.659
is writing.
 

00:54:12.659 --> 00:54:17.766
The writing of the poem becomes
the act by which he is an

00:54:17.766 --> 00:54:21.413
exilic--
as an exile can go on in his

00:54:21.413 --> 00:54:25.001
dislocation,
his utter dislocation from the

00:54:25.001 --> 00:54:26.340
city,
from family,

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:29.284
from his habits,
can go on actually relating

00:54:29.284 --> 00:54:31.268
himself to a more writing.
 

00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:35.902
The work is the way in which
the self enters history and can

00:54:35.902 --> 00:54:37.159
shape history.
 

00:54:37.159 --> 00:54:39.606
It's not Aeneas,
it's not Phaeton,

00:54:39.606 --> 00:54:42.500
it's not going to be the
Hippolytus,

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:46.077
it's not even Cacciaguida's own
account of his own grandiloquent

00:54:46.077 --> 00:54:48.349
connection with the world of
history,

00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:53.442
a way in which Dante's self
enters history is through this

00:54:53.442 --> 00:54:57.315
idea of poetry--
of a writing that is now also

00:54:57.315 --> 00:55:01.621
described in terms of food,
as you can see here first of

00:55:01.621 --> 00:55:05.780
all, with the bitter herbs and
now the voices gives us the

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:10.375
first taste that will afterwards
leave vital nourishment when it

00:55:10.375 --> 00:55:11.980
is digested, etc.
 

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:18.789
Words--first of all,
let me just clear the air here.

00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:23.813
No one of you has these
misconceptions about poetic

00:55:23.813 --> 00:55:29.840
language that somehow it's some
sort of faint symbol divorced

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.550
from reality.
 

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:36.226
Dante goes beyond this idea of
the relationship of language to

00:55:36.226 --> 00:55:37.530
representation.
 

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:40.731
That was the problem of the
chronicles and they gave fairly

00:55:40.731 --> 00:55:44.099
faithful accounts and he can
give fairly faithful accounts.

00:55:44.099 --> 00:55:47.010
That's the mode of a certain
historiography.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:52.150
What Dante's saying is that
words are things in themselves,

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:56.275
that words are food that
change, and being things they

00:55:56.275 --> 00:56:01.181
have a kind of solidity and have
a sort of truth value in and of

00:56:01.181 --> 00:56:02.349
themselves.
 

00:56:02.349 --> 00:56:07.250
This is really the biblical
language that resurfaces,

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:12.338
son of man, eat the book,
you remember these lines from

00:56:12.338 --> 00:56:13.469
Ezekiel?
 

00:56:13.469 --> 00:56:16.969
This is exactly the kind of
language that is returning here,

00:56:16.969 --> 00:56:20.742
and which Dante bends,
the sort of language to define

00:56:20.742 --> 00:56:25.170
himself in a relationship to his
future project of writing the

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:29.088
poem and that project of writing
the poem is his way of

00:56:29.088 --> 00:56:32.210
establishing his place literally
in--

00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:34.518
which is a utopian place in
history.

00:56:34.518 --> 00:56:37.001
I say utopian because it
doesn't have to be understood in

00:56:37.001 --> 00:56:37.800
any local sense.
 

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.750
I do not belong to the city
only because I occupy a

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:44.199
particular place in the city.
 

00:56:44.199 --> 00:56:48.416
It is the act of writing
poetry, that's really what

00:56:48.416 --> 00:56:49.260
matters.
 

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:53.809
What I'm referring to is also,
and here I am,

00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:58.445
a sort of correction,
very mild correction of the

00:56:58.445 --> 00:57:02.599
classical idea which is also a
medieval--

00:57:02.599 --> 00:57:08.510
survives in medieval times the
idea that the self is decided,

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:12.061
the value of the self is
decided by the place one

00:57:12.061 --> 00:57:15.170
occupies within the economy of
the city.

00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:18.809
Dante says that's not the way
it works.

00:57:18.809 --> 00:57:22.619
I am the project of writing my
poetry and through poetry,

00:57:22.619 --> 00:57:26.500
which is written in exile,
and therefore it's a poetry of

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.550
exile I can re-enter the world
of history.

00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:34.742
The world of history accusing
history and talking as a man who

00:57:34.742 --> 00:57:40.018
has been touched by the vision
of what justice ought to be,

00:57:40.018 --> 00:57:43.711
so this is really the remarks
that I think I can make about

00:57:43.711 --> 00:57:46.449
these Cantos XV,
XVI, and XVII and I welcome

00:57:46.449 --> 00:57:48.360
questions if you have any.
 

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:49.579
I'm sure you do.
 

00:57:56.619 --> 00:57:58.619
Yes.
 

00:57:58.619 --> 00:58:01.487
Student:  Would I be
right in seeing some biblical

00:58:01.487 --> 00:58:04.050
references within the lines
between 70 and 100,

00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:07.869
the mention of the star,
the birth, the inn.

00:58:07.869 --> 00:58:10.429
Is that some sort of a Savior?
 

00:58:10.429 --> 00:58:15.103
Prof: This is line 17,
the question is would she be

00:58:15.103 --> 00:58:19.119
right in seeing biblical
antecedents,

00:58:19.119 --> 00:58:24.737
context for the lines
with--that go from line 70 you

00:58:24.737 --> 00:58:27.849
say,
the first refuge and inn.

00:58:27.849 --> 00:58:31.398
No, and I "shalt find in
the courtesy of the great

00:58:31.398 --> 00:58:32.449
Lombard."
 

00:58:32.449 --> 00:58:38.123
That may be a crystalogical or
a crystal mimetic language

00:58:38.123 --> 00:58:41.570
behind these sort of references.
 

00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:48.670
That would be even more--it
would be truer even--

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:54.614
would be made more compelling
in light of Cacciaguida's own

00:58:54.614 --> 00:58:59.329
self representation in
crystalogical terms,

00:58:59.329 --> 00:59:03.527
both in Canto XV and--in Canto
XVI actually he talks to himself

00:59:03.527 --> 00:59:06.170
as if he were a Boethian
philosopher.

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:09.661
Dante uses the same phrase
about the death of Cacciaguida

00:59:09.661 --> 00:59:13.090
that he had used for Boethius in
Paradiso XV,

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:16.440
venni dal martiro a questa
pace,

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.110
that he had used for Boethius.
 

00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:19.619
But the language is a
crystalogical language.

00:59:19.619 --> 00:59:24.103
The only difference is that if
there is any crystalogical

00:59:24.103 --> 00:59:28.746
resonance here it very quickly
fades because Dante's really

00:59:28.746 --> 00:59:32.429
discussing himself as an exile
with this--

00:59:32.429 --> 00:59:39.014
and he understands exile as the
real condition of himself but

00:59:39.014 --> 00:59:41.539
also of human beings.
 

00:59:41.539 --> 00:59:45.856
I will go on so far as to say,
in order to connect your

00:59:45.856 --> 00:59:50.654
theological perspective and what
I have been saying about the

00:59:50.654 --> 00:59:55.771
self in history is that exile is
also the root of one's religious

00:59:55.771 --> 00:59:57.369
consciousness.
 

00:59:57.369 --> 01:00:03.159
We have--those of us who have a
religious conscious,

01:00:03.159 --> 01:00:06.202
and I think we all do,
just as we have an aesthetic

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:10.139
sense we all do,
that religious conscious comes

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:15.050
always out of the sense or the
feeling even better,

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:18.389
better than the sense,
the feeling that we are not

01:00:18.389 --> 01:00:19.820
where we should be.
 

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:24.652
That we are somehow not where
we should both in terms of time

01:00:24.652 --> 01:00:28.518
and in terms of space,
that we are dislocated.

01:00:28.518 --> 01:00:32.710
And this exile,
this exilic imagination then

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:38.266
shapes also the theological
language of Dante and accounts

01:00:38.266 --> 01:00:44.309
for his persuasion that exile
defines the human condition.

01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:49.190
It's not just an empirical--it
is his empirical experience.

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:51.898
That is to say,
it relates to him but he

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:55.302
understands that it's
really--we're all engaged in

01:00:55.302 --> 01:00:58.429
this kind of--I'll talk about
this later.

01:00:58.429 --> 01:01:02.978
By the way, I'm forcing my hand
because the text does not really

01:01:02.978 --> 01:01:06.824
allow me to do that,
but when he discusses hope,

01:01:06.824 --> 01:01:10.059
the most extraordinary of all
virtues,

01:01:10.059 --> 01:01:13.190
the most deceptive maybe of all
virtues,

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:18.007
there healing's hope and exile
in a very clear way and I'll

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:22.659
reserve that as a surprise for
whatever next week or--

01:01:22.659 --> 01:01:23.690
yeah next week.
 

01:01:25.559 --> 01:01:28.449
Please.
 

01:01:28.449 --> 01:01:33.349
Student:  You mentioned
Augustine's confessions earlier,

01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:37.202
and talking about the different
conceptions of how the self

01:01:37.202 --> 01:01:40.411
relates to the city,
and you said Dante didn't agree

01:01:40.411 --> 01:01:41.280
with Augustine.
 

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.503
I didn't catch everything you
were saying about Augustine's

01:01:44.503 --> 01:01:45.559
view of the self.
 

01:01:45.559 --> 01:01:47.670
Can you just review?
 

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:49.190
Prof: The question is
about--

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:53.563
I was discussing modalities of
this relationship between the

01:01:53.563 --> 01:01:57.268
self and history at the
beginning of my remarks.

01:01:57.268 --> 01:02:01.952
One of them obviously was--I
mentioned-- let me just give a

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:03.889
little resume of this.
 

01:02:03.889 --> 01:02:08.164
I mentioned Cacciaguida himself
who has a kind of special

01:02:08.164 --> 01:02:11.601
understanding of history and
that defines him,

01:02:11.601 --> 01:02:14.349
his taking part in the
crusades.

01:02:14.349 --> 01:02:18.583
The other one is with which
Dante begins is Aeneas who is a

01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:21.139
model for Augustine,
as you know.

01:02:21.139 --> 01:02:24.559
I'm answering your question now.
 

01:02:24.559 --> 01:02:28.949
The Confessions of
Augustine are constructed as

01:02:28.949 --> 01:02:33.590
nothing less than what we
call--what I call the Aeneid of

01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:34.750
the heart.
 

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:37.980
That is to say,
he goes from Carthage,

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.139
he has his Didos;
you remember when he leaves

01:02:41.139 --> 01:02:44.391
Carthage to go to Rome,
and the Dido doesn't--he

01:02:44.391 --> 01:02:49.358
doesn't just abandon them but he
describes as they hold on to his

01:02:49.358 --> 01:02:50.599
garment, etc.
 

01:02:50.599 --> 01:02:54.719
Then he goes to Rome,
so it's really a pattern on an

01:02:54.719 --> 01:02:58.840
epic, on the Virgilian epic of
the Aeneid.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.659
But Augustine is very different
from Aeneas.

01:03:01.659 --> 01:03:04.630
He doesn't go to Rome to found
an empire.

01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:07.827
He's a professor of rhetoric,
he teaches, he's a teacher,

01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:11.309
a professor of rhetoric and he
comes to understand himself.

01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:14.612
Actually the great moment,
the great revelation for him,

01:03:14.612 --> 01:03:17.496
there are two moments of great
revelation to him,

01:03:17.496 --> 01:03:19.840
which we really never talked
about.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.000
One, which he's in Ostia,
a little town on the--

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.880
by the sea outside of Rome and
he said,

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.733
he saw this mother at the
window and they share in a kind

01:03:31.733 --> 01:03:33.179
of mystical vision.
 

01:03:33.179 --> 01:03:36.204
He describes this ecstasy that
they have while they look

01:03:36.204 --> 01:03:38.349
outside, and then she's about to
die.

01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:42.728
That is a decisive moment
in--clearly in his life and his

01:03:42.728 --> 01:03:44.840
understanding of himself.
 

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.961
The other one comes in the
Garden in Milan when he hears

01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:53.610
voices that tell him to--that he
understands in his own way.

01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:58.628
It's an idea of a self which
is--which understands the self

01:03:58.628 --> 01:04:03.389
as a death of the old man and
the birth of a new man.

01:04:03.389 --> 01:04:06.260
This is the old Adam and the
new Adam.

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:09.422
The Christian idea of
conversion, St.

01:04:09.422 --> 01:04:13.463
Paul's command,
you have to let the old man die

01:04:13.463 --> 01:04:17.329
so that the new man can come
into being.

01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:19.219
That's the understanding of the
self.

01:04:19.219 --> 01:04:22.449
Now Dante of course,
when I say he doesn't agree

01:04:22.449 --> 01:04:26.159
with it, of course he's not
Aeneas, he did say that.

01:04:26.159 --> 01:04:28.429
He's not Paul;
he did say that;

01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:29.820
there are those who say well
he's ironic.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:31.550
I don't see where the irony is.
 

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:33.518
He's not Aeneas and he's not
Paul;

01:04:33.518 --> 01:04:37.342
he uses them to relate,
to coordinate himself to them

01:04:37.342 --> 01:04:41.460
and now he's using a number of
other mythical figures.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.050
What is one's own relationship
to genealogy?

01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:49.579
What is one's own relationship
to the chronicles?

01:04:49.579 --> 01:04:51.889
What is one's own relationship
to mythical empires?

01:04:51.889 --> 01:04:53.268
You understand what I'm saying?
 

01:04:53.268 --> 01:04:56.159
The idea of self that he is
going to have is not really

01:04:56.159 --> 01:05:00.039
Augustine's;
it's that of the man first of

01:05:00.039 --> 01:05:06.083
all who can belong to the
history of the world by writing

01:05:06.083 --> 01:05:07.380
the poem.
 

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:12.429
He lives and he understands the
fundamental quality of the

01:05:12.429 --> 01:05:17.302
exilic experience of human
beings, that's not Augustine,

01:05:17.302 --> 01:05:20.050
that's really what I meant.
 

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:24.465
No disrespect for Augustine
only different--a different

01:05:24.465 --> 01:05:25.530
experience.
 

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:31.739
Yes.
 

01:05:31.739 --> 01:05:34.998
Student:  I'm still
thinking about the brief

01:05:34.998 --> 01:05:38.974
reference to the crusades that
Cacciaguida makes at the end of

01:05:38.974 --> 01:05:42.690
the Canto XV and the presence of
sectarian violence,

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:47.057
and I wonder if that--if Dante
has some idea about that that

01:05:47.057 --> 01:05:50.909
connects to his idea of the
empire as staving off the

01:05:50.909 --> 01:05:55.574
political violence of civil war
or what would Dante suggest as a

01:05:55.574 --> 01:05:57.869
&gt;
 

01:05:57.869 --> 01:05:59.070
because we saw St.
 

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:02.809
Francis last week who spoke
peacefully with the Sultan of

01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:03.409
faith.
 

01:06:03.409 --> 01:06:06.349
Prof: This is an
extraordinary question.

01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:11.277
The question is by the way
the--how do I explain

01:06:11.277 --> 01:06:15.679
Cacciaguida's reference to the
crusade,

01:06:15.679 --> 01:06:17.409
very brief reference to the
crusade,

01:06:17.409 --> 01:06:22.036
and how does that connect with
what we have been talking about

01:06:22.036 --> 01:06:26.815
sectarian violence in the Canto
of Dominic for instance in Canto

01:06:26.815 --> 01:06:31.518
XII and whether Dante is using
this as a ploy to explain,

01:06:31.518 --> 01:06:35.092
just the way he does with the
violence within the city to

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:37.579
justify the necessity of the
Empire,

01:06:37.579 --> 01:06:43.135
which he does or is this--or
does he really have an idea of

01:06:43.135 --> 01:06:46.489
the peaceful language of
Francis?

01:06:46.489 --> 01:06:51.186
Accurate--you asked a lot of
questions and really,

01:06:51.186 --> 01:06:53.869
really, really impressive.
 

01:06:53.869 --> 01:06:56.440
After all she's an Italian
major, what do you expect?

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:01.980
She has--she better impress
me--you did, you did.

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:09.309
We'll talk more about Dante's
preparing Canto XVIII,

01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:14.523
XIX, and XX is really about--it
starts with what is a heroic

01:07:14.523 --> 01:07:19.119
life and how are we to
understand the heroic life.

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:22.659
There's a reference there also
to crusades,

01:07:22.659 --> 01:07:27.981
and the question of the
crusades, the relationship of

01:07:27.981 --> 01:07:34.021
justice and Christian ideas of
justice to Muslims and Hindus

01:07:34.021 --> 01:07:37.809
will come to the forefront
there.

01:07:37.809 --> 01:07:42.079
So I really ask you to wait for
that for next time because--

01:07:42.079 --> 01:07:44.885
However, I can answer one
question immediately,

01:07:44.885 --> 01:07:48.606
which is really implied by what
you are saying more than asked

01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:49.400
directly.
 

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.000
Yes, Dante is a peace poet.
 

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.139
I would say that with full
confidence,

01:07:55.139 --> 01:07:57.380
though we know Dante was so
polemical,

01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:00.137
kicks shades,
is angry, fights,

01:08:00.137 --> 01:08:05.099
and there's always competing
visions in relation to the

01:08:05.099 --> 01:08:08.510
tradition and others,
but he's--Fundamentally,

01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:11.250
you have to establish,
you would say, differences;

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:14.000
not really renounce your
differences,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.930
but actually make those
differences the orchestration,

01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:20.476
the musical orchestration that
is going on in Cantos XV,

01:08:20.476 --> 01:08:21.510
XVI, and XVII.
 

01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:22.710
This is the heaven of music.
 

01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:26.420
This discordance,
discourses, are part of a

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.600
sovereign and transcendent
order,

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.634
but he is a peace poet which is
truly scandalous because most

01:08:33.634 --> 01:08:35.420
poets,
except for Isaia,

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:37.850
for instance who is a peace
poet--

01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:43.578
prophet, a prophet of peace,
with a vision of peace;

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:47.840
Dante really has an irenic
vision.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.953
Most poets write about
victories, about wars,

01:08:51.953 --> 01:08:55.038
about armistices,
truces, epic;

01:08:55.038 --> 01:08:59.467
the epics in England or in
Italy, it's all about the

01:08:59.467 --> 01:09:01.640
clashes of armies,
etc.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.699
Not Dante, so that's really the
direct answer I can give to your

01:09:05.699 --> 01:09:06.408
question.
 

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:09.492
Then you raise another issue
which I find a little bit--I

01:09:09.492 --> 01:09:13.180
would not want to go there but I
owe it to you to give an answer.

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:16.578
Well, what about the peaceful
language of Francis?

01:09:16.578 --> 01:09:22.497
That seems to be such a great
idea because heresy and schisms

01:09:22.497 --> 01:09:25.701
and the question--
the relationship between

01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:28.420
Christians and Muslims has
always been one of wars,

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.927
so heresy and war,
schism and war,

01:09:31.927 --> 01:09:38.305
so we can say that Dante seems
to be so radical in renouncing

01:09:38.305 --> 01:09:42.590
war and says,
look it's possible to harmonize

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:46.641
relationship or at least
confront our differences with

01:09:46.641 --> 01:09:48.630
using a peace language.
 

01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:53.461
However, things are not as
simple as that and that's why I

01:09:53.461 --> 01:09:57.359
only mention it but I will not
go into that.

01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:58.510
We haven't got time for that.
 

01:09:58.510 --> 01:10:01.216
It's really a thought I am a
little developing,

01:10:01.216 --> 01:10:02.100
I must admit.
 

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.399
The heresy is a question of
language.

01:10:05.399 --> 01:10:07.750
It's not just a question of
wars.

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:13.769
So, there are wars that go on
in language and therefore they

01:10:13.769 --> 01:10:19.481
re-propose the very differences
and stubborn divisions of

01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:25.501
understanding that qualify and
describe both the schisms and

01:10:25.501 --> 01:10:27.439
the heresies.
 

01:10:27.439 --> 01:10:31.188
So, to say "peaceful
language,"

01:10:31.188 --> 01:10:34.750
it sounds also like another way
of--

01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:39.391
another route into potential
descent and tragedy,

01:10:39.391 --> 01:10:40.359
you see.
 

01:10:40.359 --> 01:10:45.434
But I am not going to go
anymore than give you as a kind

01:10:45.434 --> 01:10:50.786
of suspicion that I have about
my own claim that Dante is a

01:10:50.786 --> 01:10:52.170
peace poet.
 

01:10:52.170 --> 01:10:54.010
We'll talk though about the
crusades next time.

01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:58.087
And may be I have time for
another question may be and a

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.569
very short answer.
 

01:10:59.569 --> 01:11:00.409
Anybody?
 

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.100
See you next time.

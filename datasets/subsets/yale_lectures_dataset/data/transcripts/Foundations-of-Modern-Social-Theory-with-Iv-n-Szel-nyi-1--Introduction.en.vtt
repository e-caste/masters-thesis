00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.490
Prof: So welcome.
 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:11.760
This is a course on Foundations
of Modern Social Thought.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.449
It has a sociology number,
a political science number,

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.240
and a humanities number.
 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.300
And my name is Iván
Szelényi.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.852
I'm a professor of sociology,
a professor of political

00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:31.503
science,
and it is my honor that I can

00:00:31.503 --> 00:00:37.980
introduce you to some of the
Founding Fathers--

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.580
I'm afraid they are all fathers
right,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.741
no mothers among them;
I will tell you why not--of

00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:50.090
modern social thought.
 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.064
It's basically theories,
starting from the sixteenth

00:00:55.064 --> 00:01:00.429
century and ending up in the
early twentieth century.

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:33.720
 
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.409
The first author on our list,
Thomas Hobbes,

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.078
did a lot of work on optics and
has been in a violent

00:01:44.078 --> 00:01:47.459
controversy with Descartes.
 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.772
So those of you who are in
natural sciences are probably

00:01:52.772 --> 00:01:58.569
familiar with Descartes and his
pioneering work on optics.

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.510
John Locke, for those of you
who aspire to become a doctor,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:11.873
was actually studying medicine
and performed a surgery on a

00:02:11.873 --> 00:02:17.210
very well-known English
politician.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.888
A quite successful surgery,
though even today doctors quite

00:02:21.888 --> 00:02:26.163
don't know whether this
politician survived because of

00:02:26.163 --> 00:02:29.389
good luck or because of the
surgery.

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.788
Anyway, the point I'm trying to
make,

00:02:32.788 --> 00:02:36.605
in the early sixteenth,
seventeenth,

00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:41.949
eighteenth centuries,
sciences and social sciences

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:46.530
are not separated from each
other yet.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.972
Jean Jacques Rousseau,
a real pain in the neck but an

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:58.067
extremely smart guy,
he also wrote an important book

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:03.538
which dealt with sciences and
social studies.

00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:09.073
It's really by the kind of late
eighteenth century that people

00:03:09.073 --> 00:03:13.879
are beginning to identify as
studying society or human

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.060
behavior.
 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.077
But even then,
until the very last author--

00:03:19.077 --> 00:03:22.902
what we have here,
Emile Durkheim--people

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:27.590
identified themselves with a
number of approaches,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.460
disciplinary approaches.
 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.787
There were social scientists,
all right, or philosophers,

00:03:33.787 --> 00:03:34.500
all right.
 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.049
The difference between
philosophy and social science is

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.650
a very vague one.
 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:48.331
So they're beginning to
distinguish themselves

00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:56.014
increasingly from sciences,
but they are still

00:03:56.014 --> 00:03:59.770
multidisciplinary.
 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.689
Who is Karl Marx, you know?
 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:03.689
He is a philosopher.
 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.860
He's an economist.
 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.258
He is a political scientist.
 

00:04:09.258 --> 00:04:13.677
Sociologists name him as one of
the Founding Fathers of

00:04:13.677 --> 00:04:14.658
sociology.
 

00:04:14.658 --> 00:04:22.480
Max Weber, he identified
himself as a legal theorist.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.060
He was studying economic
history.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.574
I think primarily he identified
himself, early in life,

00:04:31.574 --> 00:04:36.069
as an economist,
as an economic historian;

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.569
later in life he began to call
himself a sociologist.

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.791
So the point is,
this is a very

00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:44.790
interdisciplinary course.
 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.115
So one advantage of you to take
this course is that you will be

00:04:51.115 --> 00:04:55.139
getting knowledge,
which leads you--which would

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.230
benefit you,
if you are studying sciences.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.120
If you want to become a
psychologist,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.384
if you become an economist or a
political scientist or an

00:05:06.384 --> 00:05:12.216
anthropologist or a philosopher,
this list of names will appear

00:05:12.216 --> 00:05:14.540
on your reading list.
 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.336
Okay, so that's I think--I will
go--I have many,

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:22.538
many slides to show you,
and I will try to bring them

00:05:22.538 --> 00:05:24.639
alive to you a little.
 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.689
So I don't want to waste too
much of my time here,

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:29.370
to rush through all this.
 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.702
But let me still speak to some
of the details,

00:05:32.702 --> 00:05:36.850
what I'm sure many of you are
particularly interested.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.940
First, about the readings.
 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.791
And my first advice is:
don't let yourself to be scared

00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:47.660
by me.
 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.663
All right?
 

00:05:48.663 --> 00:05:52.480
All the readings are on the
internet.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.992
You don't have to buy any
books, you don't have to go to

00:05:55.992 --> 00:05:59.142
the library,
you just go to the internet and

00:05:59.142 --> 00:06:03.459
you on load the readings and you
can print the readings out.

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:08.331
That's when you get scared
because some of the readings are

00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:11.427
too long,
and some of the readings you

00:06:11.427 --> 00:06:16.050
start reading and you feel you
don't understand a word of it.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.581
Well, your experience is not
very different from mine when I

00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:24.040
was reading these texts for the
first time.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.439
So my advice is don't get
scared.

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:28.290
Right?
 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.172
I don't expect you to do much
more reading for this course in

00:06:33.172 --> 00:06:36.589
a week than let's say five or
six hours.

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:41.101
This will not be enough for
you, in first reading,

00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:44.600
to get the readings on your
command.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.420
Reading characters like Hobbes,
or reading even characters like

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.519
Nietzsche, is hard stuff to do.
 

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:59.264
My advice is that you kind of
quickly skim-read for the

00:06:59.264 --> 00:07:02.115
lecture;
do some reading for the

00:07:02.115 --> 00:07:06.310
lecture, so you can come in with
a sense of the text.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.302
And I will give you the most
important citations and an

00:07:11.302 --> 00:07:14.910
interpretation,
and then I'll give you a

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.389
searchlight.
 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:20.211
You can go back to the text,
and you know what you are

00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:24.250
looking for, and get ready for
the discussion section.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.577
At the discussion section,
I will keep my mouth shut,

00:07:28.577 --> 00:07:30.660
and I want you to talk.
 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.646
I will ask questions,
and we will have a lively

00:07:34.646 --> 00:07:35.600
discussion.
 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.379
Right?
 

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:40.459
So by that time you will have
to have more of a sense.

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:44.672
But I will use a lot of
PowerPoints, and the PowerPoints

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:49.420
will be put on the internet and
will help you to go through the

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.110
text.
 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.490
So my first point is:
don't get scared with the

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.300
readings.
 

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.951
Please don't drop this course
because you said there are too

00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:59.870
many, too difficult readings.
 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:05.725
This is not meant to be an easy
course, but I will make it easy

00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:06.670
for you.
 

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.709
Easy and fun!
 

00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:15.141
You can't believe how Thomas
Hobbes can be fun,

00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:21.755
but give me just one week and
you will see how fun he is.

00:08:21.755 --> 00:08:23.410
All right?
 

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:31.110
Now the other concern by people
who shop: assignments.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.840
Well there are quite a few
assignments to this course.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:41.120
But I am one of those people
who are scared of exams.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.734
I was almost 70 when I got my
driver's license because I did

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:50.158
not want to fail my driver's
test.

00:08:50.158 --> 00:08:54.220
So I understand anxieties about
tests.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.091
So therefore I have been
working hard,

00:08:58.091 --> 00:09:02.798
over my life,
to make assignments serious--

00:09:02.798 --> 00:09:07.019
make sure that you put serious
work into the course,

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:12.019
you master the material--and at
the same time the level of

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:14.740
anxiety is reduced near zero.
 

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.820
How do I do that? Easy.
 

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.190
There will be three tests.
 

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:28.700
All the three tests will be
administered on the internet.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.340
You sit in your room,
you sit in a library,

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.408
you go to a coffee shop,
you go to Starbucks,

00:09:36.408 --> 00:09:40.928
and you login,
8:00 p.m., at a given day,

00:09:40.928 --> 00:09:46.330
and then you will get questions
from which you have to answer

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.500
some of them.
 

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.308
Right?
 

00:09:48.308 --> 00:09:54.475
I also will give you a set of
questions one week before the

00:09:54.475 --> 00:09:55.220
test.
 

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.999
So you will not be surprised
what kind of questions you will

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:00.889
be asked.
 

00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:04.820
I will reduce that list,
and even from this--

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.352
let's say I will give you a
list of about eight to ten

00:10:08.352 --> 00:10:10.823
questions,
reduce it to three,

00:10:10.823 --> 00:10:13.864
and then you will have to
answer two.

00:10:13.864 --> 00:10:14.539
Okay?
 

00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:18.919
But there will be no anxiety;
you know exactly what's going

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:19.259
on.
 

00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:22.908
You will have one hour to
answer it.

00:10:22.908 --> 00:10:26.697
I don't mind if you prepare and
you cut and paste and you put it

00:10:26.697 --> 00:10:29.129
on the internet;
that's okay.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.450
It's open book,
you can use books.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.320
What I want you to do,
not to use books;

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.610
I want to use your brain,
for a change.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.139
Okay, so that's the three tests.
 

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:47.240
And then there will be one
paper for the end of the course.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.629
The paper is not a big deal.
 

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:53.259
I just want to try to bring the
course together,

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:56.658
different elements of the
course together.

00:10:56.658 --> 00:11:00.139
The three tests are about three
blocks of the courses.

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:05.634
The paper is supposed to link
at least two blocks of these

00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:06.405
courses.
 

00:11:06.405 --> 00:11:07.658
All right?
 

00:11:07.658 --> 00:11:12.937
And again, you will be able to
talk to me, and your teaching

00:11:12.937 --> 00:11:15.889
fellows, about the paper topic.
 

00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:20.881
And let me then introduce--ask
our teaching assistants,

00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:24.950
teaching fellows,
to introduce themselves.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.070
Could you do so?
 

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:31.346
Student:  I'm Elizabeth
Breese, and I'm a third year in

00:11:31.346 --> 00:11:33.240
the sociology department.
 

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.629
Student: I'm Joseph
Klett, also a third year in the

00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:39.399
sociology department.
 

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:42.480
Prof: Well we have a
third one, who didn't show.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:49.840
And I will take also two
discussion sections myself.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:56.285
I will take Monday and
Wednesday, a discussion section,

00:11:56.285 --> 00:11:57.600
7:00 p.m.
 

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:03.495
So sort of make sure that
people don't overlap with other

00:12:03.495 --> 00:12:04.970
obligations.
 

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.124
Even athletes can take it
because practices are usually

00:12:08.124 --> 00:12:10.110
over, and dinner is over,
right?

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:15.097
So after dinner you can come to
a nice after-dinner conversation

00:12:15.097 --> 00:12:15.889
with me.
 

00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:22.354
And I will be grading the
assignments of students who take

00:12:22.354 --> 00:12:25.190
my discussion sections.
 

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.423
You can also be sure that we
will make all efforts that

00:12:29.423 --> 00:12:33.970
everybody will be able to get
into a discussion section.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.851
So right now the crowd is
bigger than the number of

00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:38.580
teaching fellows and myself.
 

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.461
We have so far on the internet
listed only five discussion

00:12:43.461 --> 00:12:48.254
sections,
but if you want to take the

00:12:48.254 --> 00:12:51.533
course,
and you do not fit into any of

00:12:51.533 --> 00:12:55.106
the discussion sections,
you will be talking to me,

00:12:55.106 --> 00:12:59.230
and I will be figuring out that
you will get your discussion

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.000
section.
 

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.269
Not a single person should drop
out of this course because there

00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:07.659
is no discussion section that
student will take.

00:13:07.659 --> 00:13:12.259
You have my word for it. Okay?
 

00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:20.340
I think that's probably all
housekeeping.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.779
Any question about this?
 

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:28.538
If yes, please loud.
 

00:13:28.538 --> 00:13:32.759
Well it looks like it's clear,
right?

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:38.889
Both clear and attractive.
 

00:13:38.889 --> 00:13:43.158
As just one very last sentence,
I don't want this to be a

00:13:43.158 --> 00:13:45.750
"Mickey Mouse"
course.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.293
I want this to be serious.
 

00:13:48.293 --> 00:13:48.980
Right?
 

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.519
I want you to be challenged,
I want you to think,

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:56.206
I want you to read,
and I want you to remember what

00:13:56.206 --> 00:13:58.197
you learned in this course.
 

00:13:58.197 --> 00:13:59.009
Right?
 

00:13:59.009 --> 00:14:04.274
But I want to decrease the
level of anxiety and make the

00:14:04.274 --> 00:14:06.379
workload reasonable.
 

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:10.412
And if you come to lectures,
you come to discussion

00:14:10.412 --> 00:14:12.668
sections, it will be okay.
 

00:14:12.668 --> 00:14:16.674
You will not be overloaded by
work, and you will not be filled

00:14:16.674 --> 00:14:17.658
with anxiety.
 

00:14:17.658 --> 00:14:22.755
Now, let me try to rush quickly
through all of these authors and

00:14:22.755 --> 00:14:27.610
give you at least a couple of
words about everyone so you get

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.764
a sense what will happen in this
course.

00:14:30.764 --> 00:14:32.058
All right?
 

00:14:32.058 --> 00:14:36.879
And I have how many--27 minutes
to do that.

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:42.710
So this is Thomas Hobbes,
born in 1588.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:48.000
Well, Hobbes had a bit of a
troubled childhood--a difficult

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.106
father who was a clergyman,
got into a fight with another

00:14:53.106 --> 00:14:56.298
clergyman and had to disappear.
 

00:14:56.298 --> 00:15:00.322
He had a fight actually in a
cemetery, which in the sixteenth

00:15:00.322 --> 00:15:03.539
century was no-no,
especially for a clergyman.

00:15:03.539 --> 00:15:07.330
Anyway, he grew up with uncles.
 

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.240
Nevertheless,
he got to the University of

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.855
Oxford,
did pretty good,

00:15:12.855 --> 00:15:17.808
and became a tutor of William
Cavendish,

00:15:17.808 --> 00:15:21.470
and then traveled with him to
Europe,

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:26.200
France, and Italy,
and he met Galileo and was

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.639
greatly influenced by Galileo.
 

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:33.331
At that time in English
universities,

00:15:33.331 --> 00:15:37.330
they were mainly teaching
Aristotle,

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:42.950
and well Hobbes became very
disenchanted with Aristotle,

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.668
the dogmatism of Aristotle's
philosophy,

00:15:46.668 --> 00:15:51.854
and he was enthralled by the
emergence of new positive

00:15:51.854 --> 00:15:57.298
science,
what Galileo represented.

00:15:57.298 --> 00:16:01.106
Then he came back in England,
and there were very turbulent

00:16:01.106 --> 00:16:04.076
politics;
I will talk about this greater

00:16:04.076 --> 00:16:05.200
in the course.
 

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.961
And he was among those,
as a conservative guy--if you

00:16:09.961 --> 00:16:14.907
are Republican you will love
it--he sided with the king

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:17.379
against the parliament.
 

00:16:17.379 --> 00:16:25.386
And since he did that in 1640,
he better skipped and went to

00:16:25.386 --> 00:16:31.630
France, into exile,
and then returned in '51 to

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.259
England.
 

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:37.828
Because he was a troublemaker,
he was not only in conflict

00:16:37.828 --> 00:16:41.756
with the Republicans,
he was also in conflict with

00:16:41.756 --> 00:16:43.200
the Royalists.
 

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.379
He died in 1679.
 

00:16:46.379 --> 00:16:52.168
Now his first work was a
translation of Thucydides.

00:16:52.168 --> 00:16:55.975
He liked Thucydides because he
thought Thucydides showed why

00:16:55.975 --> 00:16:57.458
democracy doesn't work.
 

00:16:57.458 --> 00:16:58.038
Right?
 

00:16:58.038 --> 00:17:04.759
He's an absolutist,
Hobbes: a conservative,

00:17:04.759 --> 00:17:06.838
absolutist.
 

00:17:06.838 --> 00:17:09.848
And then he wrote an
interesting trilogy,

00:17:09.848 --> 00:17:14.740
and this again shows the unity
of sciences and social sciences.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:20.038
The first volume deals with the
human body, with biology.

00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:24.378
The second works on the
individual; it is really

00:17:24.378 --> 00:17:25.578
psychology.
 

00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:29.500
And the last one works on
society and politics.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.614
And he thinks the way how to
understand human existence is

00:17:34.614 --> 00:17:39.817
start with bodily functions,
and move from bodily functions

00:17:39.817 --> 00:17:42.598
to politics and philosophy.
 

00:17:42.598 --> 00:17:45.900
And then his major work is
Leviathan.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.160
This is the work probably most
of you've heard the title of.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:57.652
And this was actually at a time
when Charles I was already

00:17:57.652 --> 00:18:02.643
executed,
and he actually was considering

00:18:02.643 --> 00:18:08.917
there should be a possibility to
transfer loyalty to a new

00:18:08.917 --> 00:18:11.445
ruler--
what the Royalists,

00:18:11.445 --> 00:18:14.373
fellow Royalists,
all in exile in Paris,

00:18:14.373 --> 00:18:15.500
didn't like.
 

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:21.502
So now he had to escape Paris,
to escape the anger of the

00:18:21.502 --> 00:18:22.788
Royalists.
 

00:18:22.788 --> 00:18:27.029
This is the First Edition of
the Leviathan,

00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:32.309
one of the most influential
books in politics ever written.

00:18:32.309 --> 00:18:37.130
Well not a very attractive book.
 

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.788
The main theme is that in the
state of nature--

00:18:40.788 --> 00:18:46.868
naturally by human nature,
people are quite evil,

00:18:46.868 --> 00:18:52.083
and therefore order has to be
imposed over people above each

00:18:52.083 --> 00:18:55.231
other;
otherwise there would be a

00:18:55.231 --> 00:19:00.211
war--we would be in a state of
war of everyone against

00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:01.338
everyone.
 

00:19:01.338 --> 00:19:04.964
This is the major citation from
Leviathan;

00:19:04.964 --> 00:19:07.079
that's what everybody knows.
 

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:07.759
Right?
 

00:19:07.759 --> 00:19:16.166
Okay, John Locke is the next,
born half a century later--also

00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:19.250
a British scientist.
 

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.660
He came from a minor gentry
family.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.445
He also studied at
Oxford--philosophy and,

00:19:26.445 --> 00:19:30.880
as I said, medicine was also
his second major.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.882
Early on, he was very much
attracted to Hobbes,

00:19:35.882 --> 00:19:42.190
but then he met a major British
politician, Shaftesbury.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:49.666
He performed a liver operation
on him, assumedly saving his

00:19:49.666 --> 00:19:50.568
life.
 

00:19:50.568 --> 00:19:56.422
And then he changed course from
a conservative and became sort

00:19:56.422 --> 00:20:00.205
of a Republican;
or by American political

00:20:00.205 --> 00:20:04.662
standards he shifted from the
Republican Party to the

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:07.747
Democratic Party,
that's what he did.

00:20:07.747 --> 00:20:08.690
Right?
 

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:13.049
Well, in fact,
he was even involved in '82 in

00:20:13.049 --> 00:20:18.823
a plot to overthrow Absolutism,
and he had to escape to the

00:20:18.823 --> 00:20:23.016
Netherlands--
returned in '89 to London,

00:20:23.016 --> 00:20:26.190
and died a few years later.
 

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:31.190
Well his conservative work was
in '64--

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:35.744
his address at the college in
which he actually offered a

00:20:35.744 --> 00:20:39.161
Hobbesian thesis:
Kings are gods and the

00:20:39.161 --> 00:20:43.880
people are beasts. But then
he changed completely.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:49.019
He already writes an important
paper on toleration.

00:20:49.019 --> 00:20:52.108
Liberals are still reading it.
 

00:20:52.108 --> 00:20:55.380
And especially he writes the
Two Treatises,

00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.561
which is a major foundation
work for modern democratic

00:21:00.561 --> 00:21:03.805
theory--
a major foundation work for the

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:06.069
American Constitution as well.
 

00:21:06.069 --> 00:21:08.829
This is the First Edition of it.
 

00:21:08.829 --> 00:21:10.880
So what are the main points?
 

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.872
He said, well,
men are born free and equal,

00:21:14.872 --> 00:21:18.960
and in the state of nature they
are good.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.827
There is a need for a superior,
but a superior can also be

00:21:23.827 --> 00:21:28.523
accepted by the consent of
everybody who is subjected to

00:21:28.523 --> 00:21:29.720
authority.
 

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:35.904
And he is the first political
theorist who advocates the

00:21:35.904 --> 00:21:41.190
separation of powers and has a
major impact,

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:45.380
together with Jean Jacques
Rousseau, on the foundation of

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.420
the American Constitution--
this is where the American

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.220
Constitution comes from.
 

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:56.630
Now we move from England to
France,

00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.015
to Montesquieu,
who was born in the late

00:22:00.015 --> 00:22:05.222
seventeenth century and lived in
the kind of already swinging

00:22:05.222 --> 00:22:07.220
eighteenth century.
 

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:12.509
The eighteenth century was
essentially, at least in France,

00:22:12.509 --> 00:22:14.058
fun to live in.
 

00:22:14.058 --> 00:22:17.900
Well it was a lot of
turbulence, but interpersonal

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.818
relationships were quite
interesting, you'd say.

00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:29.010
It reminds me of the 1960s,
hobbies and hippies and

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.305
whatever.
 

00:22:30.305 --> 00:22:31.598
Right?
 

00:22:31.598 --> 00:22:36.940
So before the French Revolution
you had the 1960s kind of stuff.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:42.108
Well there was not marijuana,
but there was a lot of various

00:22:42.108 --> 00:22:47.279
kinds of sex which made the
eighteenth century quite fun.

00:22:47.279 --> 00:22:51.308
And the life of Montesquieu
made it quite fun.

00:22:51.308 --> 00:22:56.054
Well he was born in the right
place, near Bordeaux,

00:22:56.054 --> 00:22:59.660
where the good wine is grown,
bread.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:04.848
His name was actually
Charles-Louis de Secondat,

00:23:04.848 --> 00:23:10.839
and he became Montesquieu when
his uncle died and he inherited

00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:15.259
the title of Baron de
Montesquieu from him.

00:23:15.259 --> 00:23:18.318
He studied Law.
 

00:23:18.318 --> 00:23:21.165
He's a major legal theorist.
 

00:23:21.165 --> 00:23:27.163
Anyone of you who is heading to
law school will have to take

00:23:27.163 --> 00:23:33.769
this course because the theory
of law starts with Montesquieu.

00:23:33.769 --> 00:23:38.150
Anyway, he studied at the
University of Bordeaux.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.711
In '28 he did the right thing.
 

00:23:40.711 --> 00:23:44.813
You know, to be a
parliamentarian in Bordeaux was

00:23:44.813 --> 00:23:49.170
boring and rather he did,
he went into commerce.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:54.640
He became a wine merchant and a
mercenary and an adventurer--

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.471
spent two years traveling all
over in Europe and having lots

00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:02.478
of fun,
leaving his wife behind to run

00:24:02.478 --> 00:24:03.500
the business.
 

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.068
Not very nice of him.
 

00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:11.430
So the wife was sending the
money to--

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.838
money orders or the equivalence
of it--

00:24:14.838 --> 00:24:20.218
wherever he was having fun,
in Italy or England or the

00:24:20.218 --> 00:24:23.769
Netherlands, where there was
fun.

00:24:23.769 --> 00:24:28.082
Then when he returned,
he began to do writing,

00:24:28.082 --> 00:24:33.065
particularly his major book,
that we will talk about.

00:24:33.065 --> 00:24:35.269
And he died in '55.
 

00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:37.718
About the work,
there are two major works:

00:24:37.718 --> 00:24:41.136
the Persian Letters,
which is a fun work,

00:24:41.136 --> 00:24:44.309
an ironic view of French and
Persian--

00:24:44.309 --> 00:24:49.269
 
 

00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:57.288
of the life of Paris in the
eyes of two Persian visitors--

00:24:57.288 --> 00:25:03.240
a kind of ironic view of the
absurdities of French life.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.132
And then, in '48,
he writes finally his major

00:25:07.132 --> 00:25:10.372
book,
The Spirits of Laws,

00:25:10.372 --> 00:25:15.154
which--it's an extremely
important book and you will

00:25:15.154 --> 00:25:17.690
read--
this is the First Edition of

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:19.318
it--you will read from it.
 

00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:22.308
What are the major
contributions?

00:25:22.308 --> 00:25:28.173
Well, as I mentioned already,
Locke noticed the need for the

00:25:28.173 --> 00:25:30.460
separation of powers.
 

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:36.836
But Locke separated only three
branches of government:

00:25:36.836 --> 00:25:40.446
the executive,
the legislative,

00:25:40.446 --> 00:25:44.900
and one he called the
federative.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:49.252
Montesquieu formulated the way,
how it is in the American

00:25:49.252 --> 00:25:52.238
Constitution;
namely he separates the

00:25:52.238 --> 00:25:56.348
legislative, the executive and
the judicial branch.

00:25:56.348 --> 00:26:00.276
And we will talk a great deal
about this--why it is so

00:26:00.276 --> 00:26:03.980
important to separate the
juridical branch from the

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.500
legislative and the executive.
 

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:12.980
And then he also did something
very pioneering--extremely

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.959
naïve but very
pioneering--he looked at

00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:19.115
ecosystem.
 

00:26:19.115 --> 00:26:20.390
Right?
 

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.654
He's sort of the first
environmentalist;

00:26:23.654 --> 00:26:24.660
not quite.
 

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.118
Even Khaldun did much before
him.

00:26:28.118 --> 00:26:33.348
But for modern,
more contemporary theorists,

00:26:33.348 --> 00:26:38.136
it's really Montesquieu who
tries to explain the nature of

00:26:38.136 --> 00:26:43.156
laws with climatic conditions--
looks at the interaction

00:26:43.156 --> 00:26:45.779
between nature and society.
 

00:26:45.779 --> 00:26:50.347
And it took us basically three
hundred years to realize how

00:26:50.347 --> 00:26:52.711
important this interaction is.
 

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:53.420
Right?
 

00:26:53.420 --> 00:27:00.588
So he's really doing some
absolutely path-breaking work.

00:27:00.588 --> 00:27:03.210
Now this is Jean Jacques
Rousseau.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.528
I mean, I have many favorites
among these people.

00:27:06.528 --> 00:27:08.980
Jean Jacques Rousseau is one of
them,

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.970
not--because I agree with
everything what he said,

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:19.925
but he says it so provocatively
and in such a fun way that I

00:27:19.925 --> 00:27:25.348
just cannot resist to enjoy it
all the time.

00:27:25.348 --> 00:27:29.492
He was born already in the
eighteenth century and died just

00:27:29.492 --> 00:27:33.728
before the French Revolution,
though he played a big role

00:27:33.728 --> 00:27:36.759
paving the road to the French
Revolution.

00:27:36.759 --> 00:27:40.904
About his life:
he was born in Geneva so he's

00:27:40.904 --> 00:27:43.450
Swiss, whatever it means.
 

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.210
His father was a watchmaker.
 

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.338
And, like Hobbes,
had a turbulent childhood.

00:27:50.338 --> 00:27:56.250
The father probably had some
debts, so he had to jump the

00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:01.740
boat and went to Istanbul and
left his son behind.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:09.174
Who then in '28 moved to
Annecy, France and met a

00:28:09.174 --> 00:28:13.356
wonderful lady,
Mrs. Warens,

00:28:13.356 --> 00:28:17.848
who took in young boys.
 

00:28:17.848 --> 00:28:22.190
He was just about sixteen at
that time.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:26.820
She was about ten or twelve
years his senior and--well I

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:33.144
will talk about this more;
I will give you all this gossip

00:28:33.144 --> 00:28:35.190
in this course.
 

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:39.481
Well it fascinated a lot of
people, later on,

00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:44.653
this interesting relationship
between Jean Jacques and

00:28:44.653 --> 00:28:46.410
Mrs. Warens.
 

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:51.118
Stendhal candal!
 

00:28:51.118 --> 00:28:56.978
Anybody remember the name of
the French novelist,

00:28:56.978 --> 00:29:02.470
Rouge et Noir,
Red and Black?

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:08.113
Well this is all telling the
story of Jean Jacques Rousseau

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:10.058
and Mrs. Warens.
 

00:29:10.058 --> 00:29:14.598
Well the affair lasted for a
long time.

00:29:14.598 --> 00:29:18.278
Then he moved in '42,
in Paris, and he became a

00:29:18.278 --> 00:29:19.240
superstar.
 

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.435
You know, wherever he was he
had to be a superstar,

00:29:23.435 --> 00:29:26.710
and he was a superstar in
everything.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:32.328
There is just no match.
 

00:29:32.328 --> 00:29:36.979
Probably Leonardo da Vinci is
somebody who can be compared

00:29:36.979 --> 00:29:40.650
with Rousseau in his--as a
Renaissance man.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:45.141
You know, he knew everything,
and he did everything

00:29:45.141 --> 00:29:46.220
perfectly.
 

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.788
Perfectly...I mean,
all problematic.

00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:53.240
Now in '62, he publishes two of
his major books,

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.470
and I will talk about them a
little later.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:01.075
The big scandal is they have to
escape France because he would

00:30:01.075 --> 00:30:04.848
be in big trouble with the
church in particular.

00:30:04.848 --> 00:30:08.420
But in Switzerland he doesn't
get along very well either.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:14.061
So then he goes to
England--returns later to France

00:30:14.061 --> 00:30:18.690
under an assumed name,
and died in '78.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.578
Okay, about Rousseau's work.
 

00:30:21.578 --> 00:30:26.103
I skip the first one,
which I said is still dealing

00:30:26.103 --> 00:30:29.358
with sciences and social
sciences.

00:30:29.358 --> 00:30:32.380
The disciplines are not
separated from each other.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:39.680
But let me also mention that in
'52 he writes an opera!

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.834
And he writes a wonderful
opera, Le Devin du

00:30:41.834 --> 00:30:42.490
Village.
 

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:47.904
I have a CD of the opera and if
I would know how to play music,

00:30:47.904 --> 00:30:50.875
I would show you some of his
music.

00:30:50.875 --> 00:30:52.710
It's great music.
 

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:58.680
Mozart was so excited that he
actually wrote an opera

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.009
following Rousseau's opera.
 

00:31:02.009 --> 00:31:06.250
He was in a big--I will talk
about this later;

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:09.358
I am a bit obsessed with music.
 

00:31:09.358 --> 00:31:13.371
Anyway, he was in a big
conflict with the greatest

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:15.910
French composer ever,
Rameau;

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.853
I'm sure many of you know the
work of Rameau,

00:31:19.853 --> 00:31:23.259
a great eighteenth century
musician.

00:31:23.259 --> 00:31:28.251
Well Rousseau was not quite as
great a composer as Rameau but

00:31:28.251 --> 00:31:32.246
had a debate with him,
and his music was to be an

00:31:32.246 --> 00:31:34.410
alternative to Rameau.
 

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:39.509
Rameau wanted to write French
music, and Rousseau was

00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:44.118
committed to Italian music:
melody, belle canto.

00:31:44.118 --> 00:31:45.099
Right?
 

00:31:45.099 --> 00:31:46.838
That's what he loved.
 

00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:49.720
And that's what Mozart in most
of his operas loved.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.923
That's why Mozart loved
Rousseau, rather than Rameau.

00:31:53.923 --> 00:31:54.568
Right?
 

00:31:54.568 --> 00:31:59.196
Okay, then second book,
Discourse on the Origin of

00:31:59.196 --> 00:32:00.710
Inequality.
 

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:04.207
An absolutely great book;
I don't have the time to work

00:32:04.207 --> 00:32:04.788
on this.
 

00:32:04.788 --> 00:32:07.698
And then in '62,
the two big books you will be

00:32:07.698 --> 00:32:10.478
reading from:
Émile and The

00:32:10.478 --> 00:32:12.029
Social Contract.
 

00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:15.440
Émile, '72.
 

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.897
Some of the major themes--I
mean, he writes about

00:32:18.897 --> 00:32:20.700
educational philosophy.
 

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.446
Those of you who are heading to
education, this book is a must.

00:32:25.446 --> 00:32:26.058
Right?
 

00:32:26.058 --> 00:32:30.432
You cannot be an educationalist
without having read

00:32:30.432 --> 00:32:33.404
Émile cover to
cover.

00:32:33.404 --> 00:32:34.279
Right?
 

00:32:34.279 --> 00:32:39.318
This is the foundation of
modern educational theory.

00:32:39.318 --> 00:32:42.848
And he follows the life of a
young adult.

00:32:42.848 --> 00:32:47.586
And the main point is society
corrupts--puts all the bad ideas

00:32:47.586 --> 00:32:49.140
in people's minds.
 

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:54.694
So the real reason of education
is to get rid of education what

00:32:54.694 --> 00:32:55.858
people got.
 

00:32:55.858 --> 00:33:00.535
Well I can't quite have the
ambitions to do it in this

00:33:00.535 --> 00:33:03.173
course now,
to get everything what you

00:33:03.173 --> 00:33:06.650
learned so far out of your mind,
and to get the new ideas.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.480
But that's what Rousseau
thought real education is.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:13.742
Education is negative
education--probably wrong,

00:33:13.742 --> 00:33:16.282
but a very provocative idea.
 

00:33:16.282 --> 00:33:17.098
Right?
 

00:33:17.098 --> 00:33:22.578
And then he's the opposite of
Hobbes.

00:33:22.578 --> 00:33:26.771
Man in nature is good--and
foreshadows Marx,

00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:29.210
who also believed that.
 

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.150
Now The Social Contract.
 

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:34.942
Well the idea is that
legitimate authority has to be

00:33:34.942 --> 00:33:38.288
authorized by those subjected to
authority.

00:33:38.288 --> 00:33:42.548
And he advocated the first
popular sovereignty.

00:33:42.548 --> 00:33:43.288
Right?
 

00:33:43.288 --> 00:33:48.098
It has to be done by the
majority of men.

00:33:48.098 --> 00:33:53.400
He actually was not advocating
voting rights for women yet;

00:33:53.400 --> 00:34:00.009
but at least voting rights for
all men.

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:08.369
But he also suggested that
individuals know only their own

00:34:08.369 --> 00:34:10.130
interests.
 

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:14.250
There must be a state which
expresses the general will.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:17.820
We will talk about this a great
deal later on.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.170
Adam Smith is the next one.
 

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:24.621
Again, you want to be an
economist, you have to read

00:34:24.621 --> 00:34:28.460
The Wealth of Nations,
cover to cover,

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.731
more than once;
otherwise you are not an

00:34:32.731 --> 00:34:33.929
economist.
 

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:37.409
So we will be dealing with Adam
Smith.

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:42.063
He was born in 1723,
studied at the University of

00:34:42.063 --> 00:34:46.137
Glasgow,
and later on Oxford--became a

00:34:46.137 --> 00:34:52.050
professor of logic and a
professor of moral philosophy--

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:57.385
extremely interesting that the
most utilitarian economist was a

00:34:57.385 --> 00:35:00.139
professor of moral philosophy.
 

00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:02.784
And, in fact,
his first book is called The

00:35:02.784 --> 00:35:04.768
Theory of Moral Sentiments.
 

00:35:04.768 --> 00:35:08.775
It is all about ethics,
rather than rational

00:35:08.775 --> 00:35:10.079
calculation.
 

00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:14.407
And then he travels in
France--meets all kind of

00:35:14.407 --> 00:35:17.110
people,
returns to Glasgow,

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.300
and finally '76 writes the
book--

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.701
what those of you who are
heading into business will have

00:35:23.701 --> 00:35:26.940
to read,
The Wealth of Nations.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.590
And he died in '96.
 

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:33.525
There is two Adam Smiths:
one who is talking about the

00:35:33.525 --> 00:35:36.320
self-interested individuals.
 

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.835
All of us act rationally,
and the individual is

00:35:40.835 --> 00:35:45.253
acting--pursuing
self-interest--fulfill social

00:35:45.253 --> 00:35:46.530
interest.
 

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:50.342
This is-- but in The Theory
of Moral Sentiment he's

00:35:50.342 --> 00:35:53.887
writing about sympathy,
he's writing about the helping

00:35:53.887 --> 00:35:54.489
hand.
 

00:35:54.489 --> 00:35:58.304
He's writing about God,
rather than just business and

00:35:58.304 --> 00:35:59.480
self-interest.
 

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:04.349
And there has been a library of
literature whether there are two

00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:07.802
Adam Smiths,
or whether they complement each

00:36:07.802 --> 00:36:12.385
other and there is really only
one theory and one good economic

00:36:12.385 --> 00:36:16.599
theory which is both ethical and
rational and calculative.

00:36:16.599 --> 00:36:17.340
Okay.
 

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.559
And this is The Wealth of
Nations.

00:36:20.559 --> 00:36:24.476
Well one big issue is that he
promotes self-interest.

00:36:24.476 --> 00:36:25.079
Right?
 

00:36:25.079 --> 00:36:28.936
People should be acting out of
self-interest in order to

00:36:28.936 --> 00:36:32.652
achieve the common good,
and people are the best judge

00:36:32.652 --> 00:36:35.177
of that interest,
not the government.

00:36:35.177 --> 00:36:36.018
Right?
 

00:36:36.018 --> 00:36:41.309
Well this is very much a
question for today.

00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:45.324
Healthcare reform,
do we need the government to

00:36:45.324 --> 00:36:49.599
tell us what kind of healthcare
reform we need?

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:52.875
Adam Smith probably would say
no, you don't need the

00:36:52.875 --> 00:36:55.909
government;
you should judge for yourself

00:36:55.909 --> 00:36:58.489
what kind of healthcare you
want.

00:36:58.489 --> 00:37:02.630
And then he develops the labor
theory of value,

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:05.960
that all value is created by
labor.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:12.307
He develops in interesting way
that foreshadows Karl Marx later

00:37:12.307 --> 00:37:12.820
on.
 

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:18.119
And then, of course,
he's known about the idea of

00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:20.440
the invisible hand.
 

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.760
While the invisible hand is not
that obvious.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.550
He uses the term three times in
his work, and each time he's

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.150
using it in a different sense.
 

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:37.277
One, it means simply the
invisible hand is the free,

00:37:37.277 --> 00:37:39.800
unregulated market.
 

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:43.010
That's how we normally
understand it today.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.630
Then he is using it as the hand
of God.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.684
And then he is actually using
it as the hand of Jupiter,

00:37:50.684 --> 00:37:52.969
as the bad hand,
as the fate.

00:37:52.969 --> 00:37:57.449
So we will discuss this a great
deal.

00:37:57.449 --> 00:37:59.289
It's real fun.
 

00:37:59.289 --> 00:38:03.726
Okay, then John Stuart Mill,
and in fact Harriet Taylor,

00:38:03.726 --> 00:38:08.163
who is a companion later in
life--very important for his

00:38:08.163 --> 00:38:08.889
work.
 

00:38:08.889 --> 00:38:16.706
Well he was born in London and
was actually brought up by

00:38:16.706 --> 00:38:19.079
Jeremy Bentham.
 

00:38:19.079 --> 00:38:25.150
Jeremy Bentham is the theorist
who created what later was

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:31.219
coined by John Stuart Mill
"utilitarianism."

00:38:31.219 --> 00:38:37.690
The idea, or the central idea,
of Bentham's work is that we

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:42.376
are, all of us,
seeking pleasure and try to

00:38:42.376 --> 00:38:44.050
avoid pain.
 

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:47.186
That's what explains human
behavior--utility,

00:38:47.186 --> 00:38:49.469
this is what we want to avoid.
 

00:38:49.469 --> 00:38:54.217
And the correct action is to
maximize pleasure and minimize

00:38:54.217 --> 00:38:54.789
pain.
 

00:38:54.789 --> 00:39:01.730
Now Mill had a nervous
breakdown in 1826.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:06.960
He found Bentham's theory too
oppressive.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.784
He met also Mrs. Harriet
Freedman, who was married at

00:39:10.784 --> 00:39:13.139
that time, and had an
interesting

00:39:13.139 --> 00:39:16.670
triangle--Mr. Taylor,
Mrs. Taylor and Mill--until

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:19.980
Mr. Taylor died,
and that's when they actually

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.039
got married.
 

00:39:22.039 --> 00:39:26.760
Harriet Taylor was quite a
feminist and had a big impact on

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.610
the thinking of John Stuart
Mill.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:31.440
Harriet died,
unfortunately,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:35.630
very early,
and Mill later on wrote his

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:40.909
most important book after
Harriet's death,

00:39:40.909 --> 00:39:45.139
but probably greatly influenced
by Harriet Taylor.

00:39:45.139 --> 00:39:46.398
Now his work.
 

00:39:46.398 --> 00:39:52.114
He established a utilitarian
society but eventually became a

00:39:52.114 --> 00:39:55.918
revisionist because--
I will explain it in a

00:39:55.918 --> 00:39:59.750
minute--because he said there
are really higher values,

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:04.706
which are also utilities,
rather than just seeking

00:40:04.706 --> 00:40:05.920
pleasures.
 

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:11.431
He wrote On Liberty,
Utilitarianism,

00:40:11.431 --> 00:40:16.829
and finally on The
Subjection of Women.

00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:23.143
The most important work is
probably his work The

00:40:23.143 --> 00:40:29.079
Subjection of Women,
which has inspired many

00:40:29.079 --> 00:40:33.500
feminists, even up to this day.
 

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:37.739
He argued that women are
actually worse in their

00:40:37.739 --> 00:40:42.972
conditions than slaves because
man expects women even love,

00:40:42.972 --> 00:40:45.768
rather than just obedience.
 

00:40:45.768 --> 00:40:50.119
At least from slaves they don't
expect love; that's the bottom

00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:50.619
line.
 

00:40:50.619 --> 00:40:52.489
Then Karl Marx.
 

00:40:52.489 --> 00:40:57.360
Well he was born in 1818.
 

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.170
Studied at Bonn and Berlin.
 

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:04.864
I probably can rush though of
his life--probably better known

00:41:04.864 --> 00:41:05.960
than others.
 

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.639
Met in '44 Friedrich Engels.
 

00:41:09.639 --> 00:41:13.639
Was expelled from France for
revolutionary activities.

00:41:13.639 --> 00:41:20.690
In '49 he moves to London,
became involved in politics,

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:24.869
and then finally died in 1883.
 

00:41:24.869 --> 00:41:28.768
His major works are the Paris
manuscripts you will be reading

00:41:28.768 --> 00:41:31.335
from--
it's young Marx about

00:41:31.335 --> 00:41:36.492
alienation, the German ideology,
the foundations of what is

00:41:36.492 --> 00:41:40.802
called historical materialism--
the Communist Manifesto,

00:41:40.802 --> 00:41:43.735
a pamphlet,
which you will read from it

00:41:43.735 --> 00:41:46.349
some still interesting
arguments.

00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:49.860
And finally the major work,
Das Capital.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.329
This is Das Capital.
 

00:41:52.329 --> 00:41:57.481
And I'll just skip the rest and
go on to Friedrich Nietzsche

00:41:57.481 --> 00:42:01.150
because I'm already running out
of time.

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:07.527
Well Nietzsche was born in '44
as a son of a Lutheran

00:42:07.527 --> 00:42:11.219
minister--
studied at the University of

00:42:11.219 --> 00:42:14.710
Bonn--for awhile was a professor
at Basel--

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:18.389
met, became great friends,
with Richard Wagner.

00:42:18.389 --> 00:42:23.592
Then became bitter enemies
later on, and I will explain to

00:42:23.592 --> 00:42:28.429
you what is the reason of
friendship and animosity.

00:42:28.429 --> 00:42:33.322
He actually got a nervous
breakdown, and the last ten

00:42:33.322 --> 00:42:37.275
years of his life he was just
out of touch;

00:42:37.275 --> 00:42:38.969
he was insane.
 

00:42:38.969 --> 00:42:43.072
His major work is what we will
be discussing--was written in

00:42:43.072 --> 00:42:43.489
'87.
 

00:42:43.489 --> 00:42:46.679
It is the The Genealogy of
Morals.

00:42:46.679 --> 00:42:54.050
And again, I will have to skip
what his contributions are.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:57.889
He is the first of the
post-modern theorists.

00:42:57.889 --> 00:43:01.476
He questions absolute
rationality, and the major

00:43:01.476 --> 00:43:06.210
bottom line is all knowledge is
from a certain perspective--

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:10.157
including the moral values
cannot be rooted in some

00:43:10.157 --> 00:43:12.369
universalistic principles.
 

00:43:12.369 --> 00:43:16.070
Sigmund Freud is another author
we will be dealing with.

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:19.199
Born in '56 and lived a very,
very long life.

00:43:19.199 --> 00:43:22.806
Moved to Vienna,
studied medicine,

00:43:22.806 --> 00:43:28.710
and of course discovered
psychoanalysis and created the

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:35.269
Viennese Psychoanalytic Society,
still a major movement.

00:43:35.269 --> 00:43:40.500
In ' 38, left Vienna for London.
 

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.286
His major work is the first
one, The Studies of

00:43:43.286 --> 00:43:44.139
Hysteria.
 

00:43:44.139 --> 00:43:48.000
This is when psychoanalysis is
being discovered.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.590
The Interpretation of
Dreams in '88,

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:56.130
Three Essays on the Theory
of Sexuality,

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:59.920
and the two papers what we will
be reading from,

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.570
The Ego and the Id,
and Civilization and Its

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:04.809
Discontents.
 

00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:06.675
Again, I will just skip.
 

00:44:06.675 --> 00:44:10.563
I will put this on the
internet, a brief summary of

00:44:10.563 --> 00:44:14.606
The Ego and the Id and
Civilization and Its

00:44:14.606 --> 00:44:16.239
Discontents.
 

00:44:16.239 --> 00:44:19.250
Just very briefly, Max Weber.
 

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:22.987
A German historian,
a legal theorist and

00:44:22.987 --> 00:44:24.329
sociologist.
 

00:44:24.329 --> 00:44:26.250
Born in Erfurt.
 

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:30.920
Studied at Heidelberg and
elsewhere.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.829
Had also a nervous breakdown.
 

00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:39.070
Recovers in '92 [correction:
1902].

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:44.161
Beginning to work on religion,
and writes Economy and

00:44:44.161 --> 00:44:46.199
Society in 1920.
 

00:44:46.199 --> 00:44:48.699
The major work is what you will
be reading,

00:44:48.699 --> 00:44:52.518
The Protestant Ethic,
in 1903/1904,

00:44:52.518 --> 00:44:55.365
and sections of his major
unfinished work,

00:44:55.365 --> 00:44:57.380
Economy and Society.
 

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:01.429
Again, I'll just skip and go to
our last author,

00:45:01.429 --> 00:45:05.570
Emile Durkheim,
a French social scientist,

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:09.980
who was born in '58,
as a son of a rabbi,

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:15.913
but became an atheist later on
and reconverted back to

00:45:15.913 --> 00:45:21.480
religiosity later in life--
was a professor in France.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.268
The major works are,
what you will be reading from,

00:45:24.268 --> 00:45:27.525
The Division of Labor,
then The Rules of

00:45:27.525 --> 00:45:30.675
Sociological Method,
this wonderful book,

00:45:30.675 --> 00:45:32.030
the Suicide.
 

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:35.083
And what you will not be
reading from for this course is

00:45:35.083 --> 00:45:37.750
The Elementary Forms of
Religious Life.

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:39.719
So that's about the course.
 

00:45:39.719 --> 00:45:42.847
And I hope very much I didn't
scare you, but made you

00:45:42.847 --> 00:45:43.989
interested in it.
 

00:45:43.989 --> 00:45:49.815
I will put the slides on the
internet so you can skim on them

00:45:49.815 --> 00:45:50.980
leisurely.
 

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:56.000

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.975
Professor Shelly
Kagan: We've distinguished

00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:07.840
three different views as to the
secret or key to personal

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.583
identity across time.
There's the soul view,

00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:13.310
the body view,
and the personality view.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.841
Putting aside,
for the most part,

00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:16.946
the soul view,
because I've argued that there

00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:19.530
are no souls--although
occasionally I bring it out just

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.401
for the sake of comparison and
contrast--the main question we

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:25.416
want to ask ourselves is how to
choose between the body view and

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:29.294
the personality view.
The body view says follow the

00:00:29.294 --> 00:00:31.346
body.
If somebody around in the

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:33.400
future's got my body,
that's me.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.399
The personality view says
follow the personality,

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.273
that is, the set of beliefs,
desires, memories,

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:41.460
goals, ambitions,
and so forth.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.253
Somebody around in the future
that's got my memories,

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:47.880
my beliefs, my desires,
that's me.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.420
How should we choose between
these two views?

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.727
As I mentioned at the end of
last lecture,

00:00:52.727 --> 00:00:56.160
what I want to do is offer us a
set of thought experiments.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.293
They've got to be thought
experiments, because in real

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:02.189
life, bodies and personalities
go hand in hand.

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:05.451
But by doing some science
fiction experiments,

00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:09.945
we can take them apart and ask
ourselves, "Which one do I think

00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:12.740
is me?
When my body goes one way and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.239
my personality goes another way,
where do I go?"

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:19.693
Again, just to remind you,
in order to get the intuitions

00:01:19.693 --> 00:01:22.592
actually flowing,
what I'm going to do once I've

00:01:22.592 --> 00:01:25.799
separated the body and the
personality this way,

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.819
is torture one of the end
products.

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.034
So I'm going to be asking you
to put yourself in the first

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:35.592
person.
Imagine this is happening to

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:37.195
you.
And ask yourself,

00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:39.950
"Which one do I want to be
tortured?

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.739
Or which one do I want to not
be tortured?"

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:47.915
Because that will give you some
kind of evidence as to which one

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:52.036
you take to be you.
And think about this in that

00:01:52.036 --> 00:01:56.144
special first person
ego-concerned way that comes

00:01:56.144 --> 00:01:59.680
naturally to us.
Just bracket any moral concerns

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.191
you may have about torturing
other people or agreeing that

00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:05.409
somebody else should be
tortured.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.643
For our purposes,
right now, if I brought up a

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:12.810
volunteer from the class and I'm
asking you--here's you,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.564
there's the other
volunteer--which one do you want

00:02:15.564 --> 00:02:17.992
to be tortured?
it's, "Let that one be

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:20.120
tortured.
Don't let it happen to me."

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.560
That's how we know this is
me speaking.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.840
All right, so that's the
question I'm going to ask you.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.024
I'll probably slip into talking
about this experiment as though

00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:30.098
it's being done to me.
But to get it vivid,

00:02:30.098 --> 00:02:36.449
you should think of it as
though it's being done to you.

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:37.719
I'll mention,
just in passing,

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.169
that these thought experiments
that I'm about to give,

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:44.042
I'm going to give a pair of
them, come from Bernard

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:47.140
Williams, who's a British
philosopher.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.039
All right, so case number one.
Here you are.

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:56.311
The mad scientist has kidnapped
you and he says:

00:02:56.311 --> 00:03:01.469
I've been working on mind
transfer machines.

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.765
And what I'm going to do is
I've got you and I've also

00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:09.250
kidnapped somebody else over
here, Linda.

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.389
And I'm going to hook you up to
my machines and swap your minds.

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.436
And what that means is,
I'm going to read off the

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:25.498
memories and the beliefs and the
desires from your brain and read

00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:29.560
off the memories and desires and
beliefs from Linda's brain.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.037
And then I'm going to
electronically transfer Linda's

00:03:33.037 --> 00:03:36.982
memories and beliefs and so
forth over here and implant them

00:03:36.982 --> 00:03:39.901
onto this brain.
And take your memories and

00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:43.430
beliefs and so forth and implant
them onto Linda's brain.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.819
First, we'll put you to sleep
when we do all this procedure.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.694
Then when you wake up,
you will wake up in Linda's

00:03:51.694 --> 00:03:54.288
body."
There'll be something here

00:03:54.288 --> 00:03:58.439
that, you'll wake up and you'll
say, "What am I doing in this

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.680
new body?
What happened to my beard?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.830
How come I'm speaking in this
high female voice?"

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.332
Whatever it is,
but you'll think to yourself,

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.960
"Well, here I am,
Shelly Kagan.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.700
I seem to be inhabiting Linda's
body.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.352
Don't know how that happened.
Oh yes, the mad scientist

00:04:19.352 --> 00:04:23.050
kidnapped me and he transferred
us, he swapped us.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.200
He swapped our bodies,
swapped our minds.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.626
I guess the whole thing works."
So the mad scientist explains

00:04:29.626 --> 00:04:31.987
all of this to you,
but in order to give it a

00:04:31.987 --> 00:04:34.201
little kicker,
because he's also an evil mad

00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:36.669
scientist--that may be evil
already, but because he's an

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.231
evil mad scientist--he says,
"And then when I'm done--" So

00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:44.649
over here we've got Shelly's
body but Linda's personality.

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:46.170
So Linda thinking "What am I
doing?"

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.950
and "What am I doing in
Shelly's body?

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.085
How did I get a beard?"
So over here,

00:04:51.085 --> 00:04:54.537
Linda, in Shelly's body.
Over here, Shelly,

00:04:54.537 --> 00:04:58.197
in Linda's body.
"I'm going to torture one of

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:01.153
these.
But because I'm a generous evil

00:05:01.153 --> 00:05:04.331
mad scientist,
I want to ask you which one

00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:07.083
should I torture?"
Now, when I think about this,

00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:09.369
and again, I'm inviting you to
think about this in the first

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:10.879
person, so this is happening to
you.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:14.692
When I think about this,
I say "Torture the one over

00:05:14.692 --> 00:05:16.409
here."
I'm going to be over

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.654
here in Linda's body,
horrified at what's been going

00:05:19.654 --> 00:05:22.461
on,
horrified that she's being

00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:27.120
tortured, but at least it's not
happening to me.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.540
That's the intuition I've got
when I think about this case.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.804
When the mad scientist asks me,
"Which one of these two should

00:05:36.804 --> 00:05:41.259
I torture?"
I say, "Torture this one."

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.944
Because if I were to say
"Torture this one" and

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:46.122
then he does it,
think about what's going to

00:05:46.122 --> 00:05:47.776
happen.
I'll be thinking "I'm Shelly

00:05:47.776 --> 00:05:48.845
Kagan.
Oh, this is what a horrible

00:05:48.845 --> 00:05:51.110
situation.
Oh, the pain, the pain!

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.949
Stop the pain!
Make it go away!"

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.240
I don't want that to happen to
me.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.986
If this one's being tortured,
nobody's thinking to himself,

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:03.250
"Oh, I'm Shelly Kagan in
horrible pain."

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.220
So I want this one to be
tortured.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.860
All right, that's the intuition
I've got about the case.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.435
Now, if you've got that same
intuition, think about the

00:06:12.435 --> 00:06:16.613
implications of that intuition.
You're saying that I,

00:06:16.613 --> 00:06:19.840
Shelly Kagan,
ended up over here.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.500
But that's not my body.
This is Linda's body.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.350
Shelly Kagan's old body is over
here.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.116
But this is the one that's me,
because this is the one that I

00:06:31.116 --> 00:06:35.079
don't want to have tortured.
So the body isn't the key to

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:39.268
personal identity.
Personality is the key to

00:06:39.268 --> 00:06:43.675
personal identity.
This has got my personality,

00:06:43.675 --> 00:06:48.759
my memories of growing up in
Chicago, becoming a philosopher,

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.507
my thoughts about what I want
to have happen to my children,

00:06:51.507 --> 00:06:54.300
my fears about how I'm going to
explain what's going on to my

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.596
wife.
Whatever it is,

00:06:55.596 --> 00:06:58.400
this is the Shelly Kagan
personality over here.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.376
This is me.
That follows then that this

00:07:01.376 --> 00:07:05.519
intuition suggests that what I
find intuitively plausible is

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:08.820
the personality theory of
personal identity.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.209
Now, let's tell a different
story.

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:17.492
Both of these stories,
as I say, come from Bernard

00:07:17.492 --> 00:07:19.717
Williams.
Bernard Williams says here's

00:07:19.717 --> 00:07:21.629
another example we can think
about.

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:26.263
Mad scientist,
again, kidnaps you,

00:07:26.263 --> 00:07:29.290
kidnaps Linda.
And he says,

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.759
"Shelly, I've got some news for
you."

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:34.149
I'm switching between you and
me.

00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:36.340
He says, "Shelly,
I've got some news for you.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.000
I'm going to torture you."
I say, "No, no!

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.157
Please don't do it to me!
Please, please,

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:43.807
don't torture me!"
He says, "Well,

00:07:43.807 --> 00:07:45.420
you know, I'm in the mad
scientist business.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.779
This is what I do.
I'm going to torture you."

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:52.397
He says, "But because I'm a
generous mad scientist,

00:07:52.397 --> 00:07:56.922
before I torture you,
what I'm going to do is give

00:07:56.922 --> 00:08:01.191
you amnesia.
I'm going to completely scrub

00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:06.389
clean your brain so that you
won't remember that you're

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:09.696
Shelly Kagan.
You won't have any memories of

00:08:09.696 --> 00:08:12.587
growing up in Chicago.
You won't have any memories of

00:08:12.587 --> 00:08:14.329
deciding to become a
philosopher.

00:08:14.329 --> 00:08:17.149
You won't remember getting
married or having children.

00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:19.889
You won't remember the--you
won't have any desire.

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:24.114
The whole thing wiped clean,
complete perfect amnesia before

00:08:24.114 --> 00:08:27.130
I torture you.
Don't you feel better?"

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.710
No, I don't feel better.
I'm still going to be tortured

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.700
and now we've added insult to
injury.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.870
I've got amnesia as well as
being tortured.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.300
No comfort there.
"Well," he says,

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.070
"Look, I'll make the deal
sweeter for you.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:46.798
After I give you amnesia,
before I torture you,

00:08:46.798 --> 00:08:52.452
I will drive you insane and
make you believe that you're

00:08:52.452 --> 00:08:54.570
Linda.
I've been studying Linda.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.588
There she is.
I've been reading her

00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:59.757
psychology by looking at her
brain waves and so forth and so

00:08:59.757 --> 00:09:03.022
on.
And so I'm going to delude you

00:09:03.022 --> 00:09:07.558
into thinking that you're Linda.
I'm going to make you think

00:09:07.558 --> 00:09:09.170
‘Oh, I'm Linda.'"
You won't talk like that.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.011
"Oh, I'm Linda."
"And you'll have the memories

00:09:12.011 --> 00:09:15.144
of Linda growing up in
Pennsylvania and you'll remember

00:09:15.144 --> 00:09:17.947
Linda's family and,
like Linda, you'll want to be

00:09:17.947 --> 00:09:20.740
an author, or whatever it is
that Linda wants to be.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:24.230
And then I'll torture you.
Are you happy now?"

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.169
No, I'm not happy now.
First of all,

00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:28.009
I'm being tortured.
I was given amnesia.

00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:30.212
And now you've driven me crazy
and make me--deluded me into

00:09:30.212 --> 00:09:34.279
thinking that I'm Linda.
No comfort there.

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:36.583
He says, "Okay,
last attempt to make--you're

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:38.620
not being very reasonable," he
says.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.202
"Last attempt,
I'm going to,

00:09:40.202 --> 00:09:43.425
after I drive you crazy and
make you think you're Linda,

00:09:43.425 --> 00:09:46.590
I'm going to do the
corresponding thing for Linda.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.904
I'm going to give her amnesia
and then I'm going to drive her

00:09:49.904 --> 00:09:52.389
crazy and make her think that
she's Shelly.

00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:56.519
Give her all of your memories
and beliefs and desires.

00:09:56.519 --> 00:10:00.420
Now is it okay that I'm going
to torture you?"

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.348
No.
It hardly makes it--it was bad

00:10:03.348 --> 00:10:06.919
enough I was being tortured and
given amnesia and driven insane.

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:09.912
It doesn't really make it any
better that you're also going to

00:10:09.912 --> 00:10:12.170
give amnesia and drive insane
somebody else.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.300
Don't torture me!

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.865
If you've got to torture
somebody, I say in my nonethical

00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:24.880
mood, if you've got to torture
somebody, do it to her.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.295
Don't do it to me.
When I think about this second

00:10:30.295 --> 00:10:34.147
case, that's my intuition.
Now, think about the

00:10:34.147 --> 00:10:37.447
implications of this second case
for the theory of personal

00:10:37.447 --> 00:10:41.195
identity.
If I don't want this thing over

00:10:41.195 --> 00:10:45.942
here to be tortured,
that must be because I think

00:10:45.942 --> 00:10:48.004
it's me.
But if it's me,

00:10:48.004 --> 00:10:50.409
what's the key to personal
identity?

00:10:50.409 --> 00:10:53.535
Well, not personality,
because after all,

00:10:53.535 --> 00:10:58.302
this doesn't end up with Shelly
Kagan's personality before the

00:10:58.302 --> 00:11:02.125
torture.
Shelly Kagan's personality is

00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:05.948
over there.
This is Shelly Kagan's body and

00:11:05.948 --> 00:11:10.103
that suggests if I don't want
this to be tortured,

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:14.512
it's because I believe in the
body theory of personal

00:11:14.512 --> 00:11:16.700
identity.
Follow the body,

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.903
not follow the personality.
Even though he swapped our

00:11:20.903 --> 00:11:25.149
personalities,
it's still me he's torturing.

00:11:25.149 --> 00:11:29.201
That's the intuition I've got
when I think about Bernard

00:11:29.201 --> 00:11:32.449
Williams' second case.
Now, we're in a bit of a pickle

00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:34.549
here, from the philosophical
point of view.

00:11:34.549 --> 00:11:38.328
Because when we've thought
about the first case,

00:11:38.328 --> 00:11:42.751
the intuition seemed to be,
ah, personality's the key to

00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:46.842
personal identity.
But when we thought about the

00:11:46.842 --> 00:11:51.808
second case, the intuition seems
to be, huh, body is the key to

00:11:51.808 --> 00:11:54.909
personal identity.
That's bad, right?

00:11:54.909 --> 00:11:58.248
Two different cases give us two
different, diametrically

00:11:58.248 --> 00:12:00.980
opposed, answers on the very
same question.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.697
One sec.
And it's worse still--Of

00:12:05.697 --> 00:12:09.084
course, if you don't share the
intuitions that I just--I was

00:12:09.084 --> 00:12:11.840
being honest with you.
Those really are my intuitions

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.051
when I think about these cases.
If you're with me,

00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:15.610
you're in a philosophical
problem.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.436
If you're not with me,
if you didn't have the same

00:12:18.436 --> 00:12:21.320
intuitions, then maybe you don't
have a problem.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.573
But I've got a problem.
And it's worse still because

00:12:24.573 --> 00:12:27.502
it's not really,
if we're careful and think

00:12:27.502 --> 00:12:29.937
about it,
it's not really as though we

00:12:29.937 --> 00:12:33.076
have two different cases and
intuitively we want to give

00:12:33.076 --> 00:12:35.929
different answers to those two
different cases.

00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:40.429
Really, all we've got there is
just one case.

00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:44.559
It's the very same case,
the very same story,

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:47.750
that I told two different
times.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.427
In both cases,
before the torturing ends,

00:12:51.427 --> 00:12:56.759
goes in, there's Shelly Kagan's
body over here with Linda's

00:12:56.759 --> 00:13:01.999
personality and there's Linda's
body over here with Shelly

00:13:01.999 --> 00:13:05.049
Kagan's personality.
And we're asking,

00:13:05.049 --> 00:13:06.600
"Which one do you want to be
tortured?"

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.925
It's the very same setup.
I just emphasized different

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:16.310
elements in a way to manipulate
your intuitions.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.685
But it's the very same case.
It can't be that in one of

00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:23.639
them, follow the body and the
other one, follow personality.

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:27.629
So it's very hard to know what
moral should we draw.

00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:30.300
The appeal to intuition,
thinking about these cases

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.170
doesn't seem to take us very
far.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.129
There's a question back there.
Yeah?

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:56.592
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Shelly Kagan:

00:13:56.592 --> 00:14:04.590
Nice suggestion.
So the suggestion was this.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.928
When the mad scientist put my
personality, Shelly Kagan

00:14:08.928 --> 00:14:14.149
personality, onto Linda's body,
he had to modify Linda's brain.

00:14:14.149 --> 00:14:17.641
And in modifying Linda's
brain--this was the question

00:14:17.641 --> 00:14:21.669
that was just raised--hasn't he
actually made that brain more

00:14:21.669 --> 00:14:24.960
like Shelly Kagan's brain than
Linda's brain?

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.682
And if that's right,
shouldn't we say--Remember,

00:14:28.682 --> 00:14:32.720
the best form of the body view,
I argued previously,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.477
was the brain version.
So if this is really Shelly

00:14:36.477 --> 00:14:39.810
Kagan's brain over here,
then this isn't a problem for

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.673
the body view.
We were deceived when we said

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:45.210
the body view said this is
Shelly Kagan.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.906
Really, the body view,
to wit, the best version of the

00:14:47.906 --> 00:14:49.889
body view, that is the brain
version,

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:53.135
now has to say,
"Oh, we moved Shelly's brain

00:14:53.135 --> 00:14:56.523
and put it here."
Well, if you're prepared to say

00:14:56.523 --> 00:14:59.484
that, then indeed you will be
able to say, yeah,

00:14:59.484 --> 00:15:01.796
it's the body view.
The body view says,

00:15:01.796 --> 00:15:04.403
"Do it to this one."
Rather, "Don't do it to this

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:06.440
one, because this is Shelly
Kagan."

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.591
I don't actually find myself
though inclined to agree with

00:15:11.591 --> 00:15:15.929
you that this has become Shelly
Kagan's brain.

00:15:15.929 --> 00:15:19.940
If you ask me,
"Where's Shelly Kagan's legs?"

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.090
They're still here.
"Where's Shelly Kagan's heart?"

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.410
It's still here.
"Where's Shelly Kagan's brain?"

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.474
It's still here.
It's not as though what the

00:15:29.474 --> 00:15:33.320
scientist did was open up my
skull, take the brain out.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.194
At least, if that's the way
we're imagining it,

00:15:35.194 --> 00:15:38.759
don't imagine that!
This is all electronic transfer.

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:42.838
It's not as though he took the
brain out and literally moved

00:15:42.838 --> 00:15:48.924
that hunk of tissue over here.
All he's done is reprogram

00:15:48.924 --> 00:15:52.586
Linda's brain.
Analogy here that might be

00:15:52.586 --> 00:15:55.625
helpful.
Think of the difference between

00:15:55.625 --> 00:16:00.799
the computer and the programs
and files saved on the computer.

00:16:00.799 --> 00:16:04.363
Personality is a little bit
like a program that's running on

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:07.474
the computer.
Though we have to have not just

00:16:07.474 --> 00:16:11.101
the generic program,
but the specific data files and

00:16:11.101 --> 00:16:15.367
databases and so forth.
What the mad scientist did,

00:16:15.367 --> 00:16:20.290
in effect, was wipe out the
hard drive, put in the other

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.139
programs from the Shelly Kagan
computer,

00:16:24.139 --> 00:16:26.139
but it's still the very same
computer.

00:16:26.139 --> 00:16:29.527
It's still the same central
processing unit,

00:16:29.527 --> 00:16:33.990
or so it seems to me.
Of course, it's true that now,

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:38.053
in a certain way,
Linda's brain will be similar

00:16:38.053 --> 00:16:43.000
to the way that Shelly Kagan's
brain had been before.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.297
In terms of how,
as it were, the floppy drives

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:48.932
are set up.
But still where's,

00:16:48.932 --> 00:16:52.860
literally speaking,
Shelly Kagan's brain?

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.590
I want to say it's over there,
not over here.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:56.510
There was another question or
comment.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:02.131
Yeah.
Student: [inaudible]

00:17:02.131 --> 00:17:12.881
Professor Shelly Kagan:
I'm not quite sure what the

00:17:12.881 --> 00:17:17.311
question is.
So the thought is,

00:17:17.311 --> 00:17:22.384
look, over here we've got
Shelly Kagan's body with Linda's

00:17:22.384 --> 00:17:25.693
personality.
If we torture this one,

00:17:25.693 --> 00:17:30.328
this thing, whoever it is,
is going to think to itself,

00:17:30.328 --> 00:17:33.370
"I'm Linda.
I'm in horrible pain.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.460
I wish it would stop.
I wonder whether I'll ever see

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.740
Linda's husband again."

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.733
Over here we've got Linda's
body, Shelly Kagan's

00:17:44.733 --> 00:17:47.754
personality.
If we torture this one--of

00:17:47.754 --> 00:17:50.788
course to torture,
you cause pain to bodies,

00:17:50.788 --> 00:17:53.470
but the pain gets felt in the
mind.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.649
So over here,
we've got something that's

00:17:55.649 --> 00:17:58.220
going to think to itself,
"I'm Shelly Kagan.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:03.017
I'm in horrible pain.
I wonder whether I'll ever see

00:18:03.017 --> 00:18:06.836
Shelly Kagan's wife again."
Yes, of course,

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:10.535
we're torturing bodies.
By torturing the bodies we

00:18:10.535 --> 00:18:13.677
cause pain to the minds,
the personalities,

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:16.670
who have beliefs about who's
hurting.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.999
What I'm inviting you to think
about is which one,

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:23.873
if you had to choose between
these two gruesome scenarios,

00:18:23.873 --> 00:18:26.319
which one would you rather
save?

00:18:26.319 --> 00:18:27.730
Which one would you rather
protect?

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:32.724
Which do you care more about?
Making sure that your lump of

00:18:32.724 --> 00:18:35.599
flesh doesn't have its neurons
hurt?

00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:39.501
Or making sure that the person
who's thinking to yourself,

00:18:39.501 --> 00:18:42.445
"I'm Shelly Kagan" or whatever
your name is,

00:18:42.445 --> 00:18:45.441
that "I'm in pain."
You don't want to be thinking,

00:18:45.441 --> 00:18:46.910
"I, Shelly Kagan,
am in pain."

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.660
Or if your name is Mary,
"I'm Mary.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.277
I'm in pain."
That's what we're trying to get

00:18:52.277 --> 00:18:55.306
straight on here.
The trouble though is that you

00:18:55.306 --> 00:18:58.773
tell the very same story two
different times and I find

00:18:58.773 --> 00:19:01.470
myself sometimes being pulled
this way,

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:07.033
sometimes being pulled that way.
So I can't use thinking about

00:19:07.033 --> 00:19:12.541
the Williams cases as a method
of deciding what do I really

00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:17.289
believe, the body view or the
personality view?

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:20.280
I find, myself,
you spin the story one way and

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.256
I follow the body.
You spin the story another way,

00:19:23.256 --> 00:19:26.929
and I follow the personality.
If we're going to have a way to

00:19:26.929 --> 00:19:30.618
decide between these two
theories, it seems as though we

00:19:30.618 --> 00:19:33.099
need some other kind of
arguments.

00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:35.639
At least, I need some other
kind of arguments,

00:19:35.639 --> 00:19:38.630
because of the intuitions I've
got about the cases.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.969
So let me turn to a different
approach to solving the

00:19:41.969 --> 00:19:45.309
question, answering the
question, which one should we

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:49.683
believe?
It starts by raising a certain

00:19:49.683 --> 00:19:55.809
philosophical objection to the
personality theory.

00:19:55.809 --> 00:19:59.412
It's going to say,
look, the personality theory of

00:19:59.412 --> 00:20:03.089
personal identity has an
implication that we cannot

00:20:03.089 --> 00:20:07.519
possibly accept.
So we have to reject the view.

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:11.850
And then become body theorists,
if there are no souls.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.940
Here's the objection.
It's a common enough objection.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.529
It's probably occurred to some
of you.

00:20:16.529 --> 00:20:21.152
According to the personality
theory, whether somebody is me

00:20:21.152 --> 00:20:24.420
depends on whether he's got my
beliefs.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.227
For example,
the belief that I'm Shelly

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:31.069
Kagan, professor of philosophy
at Yale University.

00:20:31.069 --> 00:20:33.779
Well, I'm a not an especially
interesting fellow.

00:20:33.779 --> 00:20:35.770
So let's make it more dramatic
and think about Napoleon.

00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:42.309
You've probably read about this
thing.

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:47.111
Every now and then there are
some crazy people who think

00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:52.311
they're Napoleon.
So imagine that there's right

00:20:52.311 --> 00:20:59.271
now somebody in an insane asylum
in Michigan who's got the

00:20:59.271 --> 00:21:04.842
thought, "I am Napoleon."
Well, the objection says,

00:21:04.842 --> 00:21:08.200
clearly this guy's just insane,
right?

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:14.289
He is not Napoleon.
He's David Smith who grew up in

00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:19.797
Detroit or whatever.
He just insanely believes he's

00:21:19.797 --> 00:21:22.699
Napoleon.
Yet, the personality theory,

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:25.646
the objection says,
would tell us that he is

00:21:25.646 --> 00:21:29.280
Napoleon because he's got the
beliefs of Napoleon.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.011
He's got Napoleon's personality.
Since that's obviously the

00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:36.213
wrong thing to say about the
case, we should reject the

00:21:36.213 --> 00:21:37.400
personality view.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:46.523
But not so quick.
The personality view doesn't

00:21:46.523 --> 00:21:54.539
say anybody who has any elements
at all of my personality is me.

00:21:54.539 --> 00:21:58.069
One belief in common is
obviously not enough.

00:21:58.069 --> 00:21:59.970
Look, we all believe the earth
is round.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:04.670
That's not enough to make
somebody else me.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.345
Of course, the belief,
"I am Napoleon" is a much rarer

00:22:08.345 --> 00:22:10.731
belief.
I presume that none of you have

00:22:10.731 --> 00:22:12.688
that belief.
I certainly don't have that

00:22:12.688 --> 00:22:15.553
belief.
Napoleon had it and David Smith

00:22:15.553 --> 00:22:19.319
in Michigan's got it.
But so what?

00:22:19.319 --> 00:22:24.345
One belief, even one very
unusual belief's not enough to

00:22:24.345 --> 00:22:29.004
make somebody Napoleon,
according to the personality

00:22:29.004 --> 00:22:31.211
theory.
To be Napoleon,

00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:35.377
you've got to have the very
same overall personality,

00:22:35.377 --> 00:22:40.765
which is a very big,
complicated set of beliefs and

00:22:40.765 --> 00:22:45.020
desires and ambitions and
memories.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.182
David Smith doesn't have that.
David Smith in the insane

00:22:49.182 --> 00:22:53.779
asylum in Michigan does not
remember conquering Europe.

00:22:53.779 --> 00:22:56.940
He doesn't remember being
crowned emperor.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.240
He doesn't remember being
defeated by the British.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.079
He doesn't have any of those
memories.

00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:07.230
He probably doesn't even speak
French.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.450
Napoleon spoke French.

00:23:11.569 --> 00:23:16.660
He doesn't have Napoleon's
personality.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.220
So the David Smith case isn't
really bothersome.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.570
It's not really a
counterexample to the

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.508
personality theory.
The personality theory says,

00:23:26.508 --> 00:23:29.082
to be Napoleon,
you've got to have Napoleon's

00:23:29.082 --> 00:23:31.680
personality.
But David Smith doesn't.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.186
So, of course,
we can all agree David Smith,

00:23:34.186 --> 00:23:37.099
despite thinking he's Napoleon,
is not Napoleon.

00:23:37.099 --> 00:23:41.630
No problem here for the
personality theory.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:46.220
But we could tweak the case.
We could revise the case.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.710
Some foe of the personality
theory could say,

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:56.424
"Okay, imagine that this guy in
Michigan does have

00:23:56.424 --> 00:23:59.180
Napoleon's personality.

00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:09.178
He's got the memories of being
crowned emperor and being

00:24:09.178 --> 00:24:14.140
defeated, conquering Europe.
He's got all of those memories."

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:18.549
And, remember we want him to
have Napoleon's personality.

00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:22.390
He doesn't have any David Smith
memories.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.630
He doesn't have any memories of
growing up in Detroit.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.013
How could Napoleon have
memories of growing up in

00:24:29.013 --> 00:24:34.180
Detroit?
Napoleon grew up in France.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:40.745
The objection then says even if
this guy had all of Napoleon's

00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:44.943
memories, beliefs,
desires, personality,

00:24:44.943 --> 00:24:49.756
still wouldn't be Napoleon.
So the personality theory's got

00:24:49.756 --> 00:24:50.090
to go.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.878
Well, when I think about this
example, I think,

00:24:56.878 --> 00:24:59.613
now we've got it right.
That is, that is what

00:24:59.613 --> 00:25:02.480
the personality theory has to
say about that case.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.969
But I'm not so confident
anymore that it's the wrong

00:25:06.969 --> 00:25:09.246
thing to say.
So think of this,

00:25:09.246 --> 00:25:11.833
as it were, from the point of
view of Napoleon,

00:25:11.833 --> 00:25:15.781
right?
So there was Napoleon in the

00:25:15.781 --> 00:25:22.049
1800s conquering Europe and
being crowned emperor,

00:25:22.049 --> 00:25:26.361
being defeated by the British,
being sent to exile on,

00:25:26.361 --> 00:25:28.069
was it Elba,
right?

00:25:28.069 --> 00:25:31.898
And I forget where Napoleon
actually dies,

00:25:31.898 --> 00:25:36.754
but he's got memories of
getting sick and ill and the

00:25:36.754 --> 00:25:41.329
light begins to fade and he goes
unconscious.

00:25:41.329 --> 00:25:46.136
And then--well,
we'll at least try to describe

00:25:46.136 --> 00:25:53.369
it this way--he wakes up.
And he wakes up in Michigan.

00:25:53.369 --> 00:25:56.390
And he thinks to himself,
"Hallo.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:02.190
Je suis, Napoleon!
What am I doing in Michigan?"

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.642
I don't speak French,
so I'm going to drop that,

00:26:05.642 --> 00:26:09.419
right?
"But the last thing I remember

00:26:09.419 --> 00:26:16.010
I was going to bed from my fatal
illness on the Isle of Elba.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:20.284
How did I get over here?
I wonder if there's any chance

00:26:20.284 --> 00:26:24.710
of reassembling my army and
reconquering the world."

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:29.011
If he had all of that,
it's not so clear to me that it

00:26:29.011 --> 00:26:32.745
would be the wrong thing to say
that, by golly,

00:26:32.745 --> 00:26:37.337
this is Napoleon.
I mean, it would be totally

00:26:37.337 --> 00:26:39.480
bizarre.
Things like this don't happen.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.442
But of course,
we're doing science fiction

00:26:41.442 --> 00:26:44.429
stories here.
So we'd say to ourselves,

00:26:44.429 --> 00:26:47.789
wouldn't we,
somehow Napoleon has been

00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:51.195
reborn or reincarnated,
taking over,

00:26:51.195 --> 00:26:55.813
by some sort of process of
possession, the body of the

00:26:55.813 --> 00:27:00.220
former David Smith,
but now it's Napoleon.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:04.256
I find myself thinking maybe
that would be the right thing to

00:27:04.256 --> 00:27:05.480
say.
Yeah?

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:14.420
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Shelly Kagan:

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:21.726
All right, so the thought was,
look, this guy over here,

00:27:21.726 --> 00:27:26.298
David Smith's body with
Napoleon's personality--And

00:27:26.298 --> 00:27:30.597
let's be clear about this.
There's no underlying David

00:27:30.597 --> 00:27:34.197
Smith personality still there,
to have the counterexample or

00:27:34.197 --> 00:27:38.145
the example that we're after.
It can't be that he's got mixed

00:27:38.145 --> 00:27:41.750
together memories of growing up
in France and memories of

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.865
growing up in Detroit.
He never thinks to himself,

00:27:44.865 --> 00:27:47.230
"I'm David Smith.
How did I become Napoleon?"

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.990
If you got that junk,
you don't have Napoleon's

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.792
personality.
He's just got Napoleon's

00:27:52.792 --> 00:27:57.975
personality through and through.
Well, the question then was,

00:27:57.975 --> 00:28:02.407
maybe that's not so.
After all, he doesn't really

00:28:02.407 --> 00:28:05.799
have Napoleon's experiences,
did he?

00:28:05.799 --> 00:28:09.910
Napoleon had the experience of
being crowned emperor.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.863
But this guy didn't have the
experience of being crowned

00:28:12.863 --> 00:28:15.930
emperor.
Maybe what we should say is he

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:20.737
thinks he remembers the
experience of being crowned

00:28:20.737 --> 00:28:25.102
emperor, but it's a fake memory.
It's an illusion,

00:28:25.102 --> 00:28:28.674
or a delusion,
but he didn't really have the

00:28:28.674 --> 00:28:31.579
genuine memory.
To have the genuine memory,

00:28:31.579 --> 00:28:33.509
he has to have been crowned
emperor.

00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:36.000
And he wasn't crowned
emperor;

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.668
Napoleon was crowned emperor.
Well, that's what we could say,

00:28:40.668 --> 00:28:45.759
but we can't say that until we
decide he's not Napoleon.

00:28:45.759 --> 00:28:49.702
After all, if the personality
theory is right,

00:28:49.702 --> 00:28:53.470
since he does have all of these
memories,

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.386
or semi-memories,
or quasi-memories,

00:28:56.386 --> 00:28:59.220
or whatever we should call
them.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.799
If that's the key,
then it is Napoleon.

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:06.869
So he is remembering being
crowned emperor.

00:29:06.869 --> 00:29:10.167
If you want to say,
no, no, no, those memories are

00:29:10.167 --> 00:29:13.935
illusions, it must be because
you don't think he's really

00:29:13.935 --> 00:29:15.651
Napoleon.
In which case,

00:29:15.651 --> 00:29:18.897
what you're discovering is you
don't really believe the

00:29:18.897 --> 00:29:21.470
personality theory.
Why isn't he Napoleon?

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.612
It's not his body.
The body of Napoleon is not

00:29:24.612 --> 00:29:28.784
this body and to be Napoleon,
you've got to have Napoleon's

00:29:28.784 --> 00:29:30.609
body.
It's a possible position.

00:29:30.609 --> 00:29:36.423
That's the thought that the
body theorists are trying to

00:29:36.423 --> 00:29:41.496
elicit in you when they offer
these Napoleonesque

00:29:41.496 --> 00:29:46.028
counterexamples.
You could match the personality

00:29:46.028 --> 00:29:49.930
as much as you want,
but it's still not Napoleon.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.869
Don't you agree?
That's what they say.

00:29:52.869 --> 00:29:56.344
And if you do agree,
that shows you don't really

00:29:56.344 --> 00:30:00.458
accept the personality theory.
I'm not going to try to settle

00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:01.960
this here.
Who should we believe?

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.029
The personality theory or the
body theory?

00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:09.145
I'm trying to invite you to
think about the implications and

00:30:09.145 --> 00:30:13.191
the differences between these
views so as to get clearer in

00:30:13.191 --> 00:30:16.680
your own mind about which of
these you accept.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.942
In many moods--at least,
when I think about not the

00:30:19.942 --> 00:30:23.857
simple, the ordinary David Smith
case with a single belief or

00:30:23.857 --> 00:30:26.617
two,
but the full bodied--that's a

00:30:26.617 --> 00:30:30.474
bad term--the full blown
Napoleon case with all the

00:30:30.474 --> 00:30:32.630
memories,
all the beliefs.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:36.600
Suppose David Smith there
thinks, "I remember.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.601
I remember."
I can't say it in a French

00:30:38.601 --> 00:30:42.254
accent.
"I remember playing as a lad in

00:30:42.254 --> 00:30:46.210
France burying my little toy
saber."

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:49.309
Some memory that Napoleon never
wrote down in his diaries.

00:30:49.309 --> 00:30:53.667
And we go and we dig up in
France and there is the saber,

00:30:53.667 --> 00:30:56.700
right?
This guy remembers things that

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.426
Napoleon would remember.
I find myself thinking,

00:30:59.426 --> 00:31:00.330
well, maybe that's Napoleon.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.710
Imagine a slightly different
version of this case.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:16.573
Napoleon dies on his death bed,
wakes up in heaven saying "Je

00:31:16.573 --> 00:31:21.658
suis Napoleon.
I was emperor of Europe and now

00:31:21.658 --> 00:31:28.009
I have come to my due reward.
I am here in heaven."

00:31:28.009 --> 00:31:30.838
Well, it seems like what we
would want to say is,

00:31:30.838 --> 00:31:33.614
"Yeah, that's Napoleon."
It's Napoleon even if it

00:31:33.614 --> 00:31:38.556
doesn't have Napoleon's body.
Napoleon's corpse is rotted in

00:31:38.556 --> 00:31:44.418
France.
God gives Napoleon some new

00:31:44.418 --> 00:31:47.930
angelic body.
It seems straightforward.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:51.255
If it's got Napoleon's
memories, beliefs,

00:31:51.255 --> 00:31:54.413
desires, goals,
and so forth and so on,

00:31:54.413 --> 00:32:01.049
wouldn't we say it's Napoleon?
Imagine that--back to this

00:32:01.049 --> 00:32:09.400
earth--this Napoleon type of
case happened all the time.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.529
We might have a term for this
sort of thing--possession.

00:32:13.529 --> 00:32:20.119
Every now and then,
people's bodies get possessed.

00:32:20.119 --> 00:32:24.811
They become this other person
who's, now, personality has

00:32:24.811 --> 00:32:27.835
taken over.
If this happened frequently

00:32:27.835 --> 00:32:32.349
enough, instead of just a little
science fiction story like with

00:32:32.349 --> 00:32:34.660
the David Smith case,
maybe we'd say,

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.827
yeah, possession is one of
these things that needs to be

00:32:36.827 --> 00:32:38.597
explained.
How is it the personality

00:32:38.597 --> 00:32:40.842
travels?
Well, maybe there'll be some

00:32:40.842 --> 00:32:43.210
sort of physical explanation for
it.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.759
Still, maybe we'd say,
yeah, the people have been

00:32:45.759 --> 00:32:50.319
taken over.
They've become somebody else.

00:32:50.319 --> 00:32:54.140
So speaking personally,
I don't find the Napoleon

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.759
objection a telling one.
It doesn't give me a reason to

00:32:57.759 --> 00:32:59.360
reject the personality theory.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:09.130
But we can now tweak the worry
in a slightly different way.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:14.403
Okay, so here was Napoleon back
in France with his memories and

00:33:14.403 --> 00:33:17.549
his beliefs and so forth and so
on.

00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:20.959
Death bed, goes to sleep,
goes unconscious,

00:33:20.959 --> 00:33:24.826
whatever it is.
I told you a story in which he

00:33:24.826 --> 00:33:29.715
wakes up, or his personality
wakes up, however we should put

00:33:29.715 --> 00:33:33.021
it, in Michigan.
But if it could happen in

00:33:33.021 --> 00:33:36.759
Michigan, I suppose it could
also happen in New York.

00:33:36.759 --> 00:33:40.472
And if it could happen in New
York and it could happen in

00:33:40.472 --> 00:33:44.650
Michigan, I suppose it could
happen in New York and Michigan.

00:33:48.279 --> 00:33:53.129
So right now,
let's imagine two people with

00:33:53.129 --> 00:33:58.670
Napoleon's personalities,
complete personalities,

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:04.790
one of them in Michigan,
one of them in New York.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:09.389
Whoa.
What should we say now?

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:12.230
What is the personality theory
going to say about this case?

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.359
So I don't know how to draw
personalities very well on the

00:34:16.359 --> 00:34:20.199
board, so I'll draw little stick
figures of bodies,

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:22.429
but I mean these to be the
personalities.

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:25.287
So here we've got the
continuing, evolving over

00:34:25.287 --> 00:34:28.951
time--this is all taking place
in France--the personality of

00:34:28.951 --> 00:34:30.380
Napoleon in France.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:45.876
There's the deathbed scene.
Now, up here we had somebody

00:34:45.876 --> 00:34:49.400
with Napoleon's personality
continuing.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.639
Of course, he's going to change.
He's going to evolve.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:54.447
Just like the actual historical
Napoleon kept having new beliefs

00:34:54.447 --> 00:34:57.309
and new desires,
if this really was Napoleon in

00:34:57.309 --> 00:35:01.154
Michigan, he'll start having
some new desires and beliefs

00:35:01.154 --> 00:35:03.480
about Michigan,
which perhaps Napoleon never

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:07.670
gave any thought to at all.
Who knows?

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:15.175
So this is Michigan over here.
And I said I was willing to

00:35:15.175 --> 00:35:22.329
entertain the possibility that
this is all Napoleon.

00:35:22.329 --> 00:35:26.201
Napoleon, if you think of it,
Napoleon's a person extended

00:35:26.201 --> 00:35:29.815
through space and time.
According to the personality

00:35:29.815 --> 00:35:33.714
view, what makes somebody in the
future the same person as

00:35:33.714 --> 00:35:37.477
somebody in the past is if it's
part of the same ongoing

00:35:37.477 --> 00:35:40.459
personality.
So maybe that's what we've got

00:35:40.459 --> 00:35:44.548
going on in the Michigan case.
Now, we imagine in our new

00:35:44.548 --> 00:35:49.730
version of the worry somebody
with Napoleon's personality over

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:51.430
here in New York.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:00.830
Now, if the Michigan guy hadn't
been there, what I would have

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:04.727
done, if I believed in the
personality theory or when I

00:36:04.727 --> 00:36:07.469
believe in the personality
theory,

00:36:07.469 --> 00:36:14.381
is say "Oh look,
Napoleon--reincarnated in New

00:36:14.381 --> 00:36:16.901
York."
That's what the personality

00:36:16.901 --> 00:36:19.867
theory should say and I said it
doesn't seem like a crazy thing

00:36:19.867 --> 00:36:22.019
to say if we only had the guy in
New York.

00:36:22.019 --> 00:36:24.668
Just like it wasn't a crazy
thing to say if we only had the

00:36:24.668 --> 00:36:26.736
guy in Michigan.
The trouble is,

00:36:26.736 --> 00:36:31.391
imagine the case where we've
got one guy who's got all of

00:36:31.391 --> 00:36:34.550
Napoleon's personality in
Michigan,

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:37.482
one guy who's got all of
Napoleon's personality in New

00:36:37.482 --> 00:36:39.410
York.
Now what should we say?

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:50.255
What are the choices here?
Well, I suppose one possibility

00:36:50.255 --> 00:36:54.960
would be to say the guy in New
York is Napoleon.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.740
The guy in Michigan isn't.
He's just an insane guy who's

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:03.679
got Napoleon's personality.
You could say that.

00:37:03.679 --> 00:37:07.102
The reason that it seems
difficult to say though is

00:37:07.102 --> 00:37:11.278
because it seems like it would
be just as plausible to say the

00:37:11.278 --> 00:37:12.940
reverse.
Say no, no, no.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:17.590
It's not the New York fellow
who's Napoleon.

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:19.660
It's the Michigan fellow who's
Napoleon.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.955
Well, we could say that,
but the difficulty is there

00:37:26.955 --> 00:37:31.785
seems to be no good reason to
favor the Michigan fellow over

00:37:31.785 --> 00:37:35.524
the New York fellow.
Just like there was no good

00:37:35.524 --> 00:37:39.599
reason to favor the New York
fellow over the Michigan fellow.

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:45.793
Saying that one of them is
Napoleon and the other one isn't

00:37:45.793 --> 00:37:50.261
seems very hard to believe.
Well then, what's the

00:37:50.261 --> 00:37:53.800
alternative?
Well, I suppose another

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:59.649
possibility is to say,
at least another possibility

00:37:59.649 --> 00:38:04.212
worth mentioning,
is to say they're both

00:38:04.212 --> 00:38:09.928
Napoleon.
Somehow, bizarrely enough,

00:38:09.928 --> 00:38:17.091
Napoleon split into two.
But when splitting into two,

00:38:17.091 --> 00:38:23.460
he split on to two bodies,
but they are both Napoleon.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.225
Now, it's very important to
understand how bizarre this

00:38:26.225 --> 00:38:29.701
proposal would be.
The claim is not now we've got

00:38:29.701 --> 00:38:33.705
two Napoleons who are,
of course, not identical to

00:38:33.705 --> 00:38:37.840
each other.
No, no, we've got a single

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:43.633
Napoleon.
A Napoleon who was in one place

00:38:43.633 --> 00:38:51.272
in France and is now
simultaneously in two places in

00:38:51.272 --> 00:38:56.349
the U.S.
That seems very hard to believe.

00:38:56.349 --> 00:39:00.456
It seems to just violate one of
our fundamental notions about

00:39:00.456 --> 00:39:03.400
how people work,
metaphysically speaking.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.270
People can't be in two places
at the same time.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:15.203
Well, maybe that metahphysical
claim I just made should be

00:39:15.203 --> 00:39:17.072
abandoned.
Maybe we should say,

00:39:17.072 --> 00:39:20.288
oh, under normal circumstances,
people can't be in two places

00:39:20.288 --> 00:39:23.279
at the same time.
But if you had something like

00:39:23.279 --> 00:39:25.464
this, by golly,
this guy would be,

00:39:25.464 --> 00:39:29.369
Michigan dude is Napoleon and
he's the very same person,

00:39:29.369 --> 00:39:34.119
the very same person as
New York dude.

00:39:34.119 --> 00:39:40.067
New York dude and Michigan dude
are a single person,

00:39:40.067 --> 00:39:44.070
Napoleon, who is bilocated.
It doesn't happen.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.440
But if it did happen,
it could happen.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.780
Well, maybe that's what we
should say.

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.475
But again, all I can tell you
is, I find that too big a price

00:39:52.475 --> 00:39:57.769
to pay.
People can't be in two places.

00:39:57.769 --> 00:40:01.800
It's one thing to say people
are space-time worms extended

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.769
through space and extended
through time.

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:08.838
It's another thing to say that
they are Y-shaped space-time

00:40:08.838 --> 00:40:11.118
worms.
It seems to violate one of the

00:40:11.118 --> 00:40:14.269
fundamental metaphysical things
about how people work.

00:40:14.269 --> 00:40:18.285
All right, I've got to remind
you though, none of the options

00:40:18.285 --> 00:40:20.907
here are all that attractive.
So when I say,

00:40:20.907 --> 00:40:23.018
you don't want to say that,
you don't want to say that,

00:40:23.018 --> 00:40:24.699
we're going to run out of
possibilities.

00:40:24.699 --> 00:40:26.960
So maybe this is what you'll
want to say.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.960
All right, saying that Napoleon
is in Michigan but not New York

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.072
doesn't seem very attractive.
Saying he's in New York but not

00:40:33.072 --> 00:40:35.099
Michigan doesn't seem very
attractive.

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:40.338
Saying he's in both places at
the very same time doesn't seem

00:40:40.338 --> 00:40:43.575
very attractive.
But what other possibilities

00:40:43.575 --> 00:40:46.549
are there?
If he's not one but not the

00:40:46.549 --> 00:40:51.445
other, and if he's not both,
the only other possibility is

00:40:51.445 --> 00:40:53.250
that he's neither.

00:40:58.389 --> 00:41:03.155
Given this situation,
neither of these guys is

00:41:03.155 --> 00:41:04.320
Napoleon.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:17.187
You've got separate people.
There's the person Napoleon,

00:41:17.187 --> 00:41:20.909
a space-time worm that came to
an end in France.

00:41:20.909 --> 00:41:24.569
And there's some space-time
worm taking place in Michigan,

00:41:24.569 --> 00:41:28.099
some space-time person worm
taking place in New York.

00:41:28.099 --> 00:41:31.190
But neither of them are
Napoleon.

00:41:34.329 --> 00:41:38.731
That seems to me to be the
least unattractive of the

00:41:38.731 --> 00:41:41.320
options we've got available.

00:41:45.199 --> 00:41:50.280
But notice that if we say this,
if we say neither of these

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.380
guys, despite having Napoleon's
personality,

00:41:54.380 --> 00:42:00.877
neither of these guys is
Napoleon, then the personality

00:42:00.877 --> 00:42:05.570
theory of personal identity is
false.

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:09.159
It's rejected.
We're giving up on it.

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:14.865
Because the personality theory,
after all, said if you've got

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:18.860
Napoleon's personality,
you're Napoleon.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:23.903
But now we've got people that
are not Napoleon but they've got

00:42:23.903 --> 00:42:29.280
Napoleon's personality.
So the personality theory,

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:35.900
follow the personality,
is wrong if we say neither of

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:42.525
these guys is Napoleon.
But that does seem to be the

00:42:42.525 --> 00:42:46.670
least unacceptable of the
options.

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.469
At least that's how it seems to
me.

00:42:49.469 --> 00:42:53.900
So the personality theory's got
to be rejected.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.810
Now, I think that's right.
I think, in fact,

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:58.139
the personality theory's got to
be rejected.

00:42:58.139 --> 00:43:03.420
But that doesn't mean we
couldn't revise it.

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:08.632
We could try to change it in a
way that keeps much of the

00:43:08.632 --> 00:43:11.889
spirit of the personality
theory,

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:15.190
but avoids some of the problems
we've just been looking at.

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:27.578
Here's what I think is the best
revision available to fans of

00:43:27.578 --> 00:43:34.577
the personality theory.
They should say we were

00:43:34.577 --> 00:43:39.255
simplifying unduly.
We were simplifying it,

00:43:39.255 --> 00:43:41.231
getting it wrong,
when we said,

00:43:41.231 --> 00:43:44.868
"Follow the personality.
If you've got Napoleon's

00:43:44.868 --> 00:43:48.740
personality, that's enough to
make you Napoleon."

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.833
That's not true.
We need to throw in an extra

00:43:52.833 --> 00:43:56.913
clause to deal with branching,
splitting cases,

00:43:56.913 --> 00:44:01.260
of the sort that I've just been
talking about.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:06.214
We need to say,
if there's somebody in the

00:44:06.214 --> 00:44:12.619
future who's got my personality,
that person is me,

00:44:12.619 --> 00:44:18.652
as long as there's only
one person around in the

00:44:18.652 --> 00:44:26.719
future who's got my personality.
If you have multiple examples,

00:44:26.719 --> 00:44:32.270
duplications,
splittings and branchings,

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:37.945
nobody, none of them is me.
So where the original

00:44:37.945 --> 00:44:40.688
personality theory said,
same personality,

00:44:40.688 --> 00:44:43.900
that's good enough for being
the same person,

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:49.898
the new version throws in a
no-competitors clause,

00:44:49.898 --> 00:44:54.059
throws in a no branching
clause.

00:44:54.059 --> 00:44:59.041
It says, same personality's
good enough, as long as there's

00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:02.044
no branching.
If there is branching,

00:45:02.044 --> 00:45:04.460
neither of the branches is me.

00:45:08.119 --> 00:45:14.628
Now, if we say that,
if we throw in the no branching

00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:21.164
clause, then we're able to say,
look, in the original story I

00:45:21.164 --> 00:45:26.214
was telling, where there was the
Michigan guy who had Napoleon's

00:45:26.214 --> 00:45:32.568
personality but no New York guy,
that really would be Napoleon,

00:45:32.568 --> 00:45:40.019
because it would have the same
personality with no competitor.

00:45:40.019 --> 00:45:44.428
Similarly, had we had somebody
with Napoleon's personality in

00:45:44.428 --> 00:45:48.469
New York and nobody with the
personality in Michigan,

00:45:48.469 --> 00:45:53.001
that guy would have been
Napoleon, because we would have

00:45:53.001 --> 00:45:56.710
had the same personality with no
branching,

00:45:56.710 --> 00:46:01.439
with no competitor.
But in the case where we've got

00:46:01.439 --> 00:46:05.502
branching, where we've got
somebody with Napoleon's

00:46:05.502 --> 00:46:09.159
personality both in Michigan and
New York,

00:46:09.159 --> 00:46:14.585
that violates the no branching
rule, and we just have to say

00:46:14.585 --> 00:46:20.886
nobody's Napoleon in that case.
As I say, that seems to me to

00:46:20.886 --> 00:46:27.418
be the best revision of the
personality theory available to

00:46:27.418 --> 00:46:31.472
them.
So what we now need to ask is,

00:46:31.472 --> 00:46:35.570
can we possibly believe that
revision?

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:41.670
Can we possibly accept the no
branching rule?

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:50.909
The no branching rule seems
rather bizarre in its own right.

00:46:50.909 --> 00:46:56.771
Think about the ordinary
familiar cases that we're trying

00:46:56.771 --> 00:47:00.672
to make sense of.
I'm the same person as the

00:47:00.672 --> 00:47:03.909
person that was lecturing to you
last time.

00:47:03.909 --> 00:47:07.018
According to the personality
theory or the revised

00:47:07.018 --> 00:47:09.937
personality theory,
that's because I've got the

00:47:09.937 --> 00:47:12.544
same personality.
The guy last time thought he

00:47:12.544 --> 00:47:14.592
was Shelly Kagan,
believed he was professor of

00:47:14.592 --> 00:47:16.610
philosophy.
I think I'm Shelly Kagan.

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:18.570
I believe I'm the professor of
philosophy.

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.410
He's got all sorts of memories
of his childhood.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:22.328
I've got the same memories.
He's got desires about

00:47:22.328 --> 00:47:24.699
finishing his book.
I've got those desires about

00:47:24.699 --> 00:47:27.719
finishing my book.
Same personality, it's me.

00:47:27.719 --> 00:47:30.370
That's what the personality
theory says.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:34.178
So I conclude, hey, it's me.
I know you were all worried

00:47:34.178 --> 00:47:36.750
whether I'd survive over the
break a couple days.

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:43.440
Came back, it's still me.
I made it through Wednesday.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.154
Or did I?
Or perhaps I should ask,

00:47:47.154 --> 00:47:50.822
"Or did he?"
Yeah, there was somebody there

00:47:50.822 --> 00:47:54.419
on Tuesday and yeah,
there's somebody here on

00:47:54.419 --> 00:47:57.553
Thursday,
and yeah, this person here now

00:47:57.553 --> 00:48:01.500
has got the same personality as
the guy who was there on

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:04.053
Tuesday.
But according to the no

00:48:04.053 --> 00:48:07.503
branching rule,
we can't yet conclude that I'm

00:48:07.503 --> 00:48:11.873
the same person as the person
that was lecturing to you on

00:48:11.873 --> 00:48:15.751
Tuesday.
We can't conclude that until we

00:48:15.751 --> 00:48:20.863
know that there aren't any
competitors, that there isn't

00:48:20.863 --> 00:48:26.440
anybody else right now who also
has the same personality.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.026
If I'm the only one around
today who's got Shelly Kagan's

00:48:30.026 --> 00:48:33.740
personality, then I'm the same
person as the person who was

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:37.824
lecturing to you on Tuesday.
But if, unbeknownst to me,

00:48:37.824 --> 00:48:41.893
and I presume unbeknownst to
you, there's somebody in

00:48:41.893 --> 00:48:46.510
Michigan right now who's got
Shelly Kagan's personality,

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:49.570
then we have to say,
huh, it turns out I'm not

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:52.230
Shelly Kagan after all.
Neither is he.

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:56.079
Neither of us are Shelly Kagan.
Shelly Kagan died.

00:48:56.079 --> 00:49:01.409
So am I Shelly Kagan or am I
not Shelly Kagan?

00:49:01.409 --> 00:49:07.680
Can't tell until we know what's
going on in Michigan.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:12.046
Whoa!
That seems very,

00:49:12.046 --> 00:49:18.296
very hard to believe.
Whether I am the same person as

00:49:18.296 --> 00:49:23.573
the person who was lecturing to
you on Tuesday presumably should

00:49:23.573 --> 00:49:29.269
turn on facts about that guy who
was lecturing to you on Tuesday,

00:49:29.269 --> 00:49:32.570
and facts about this guy who's
lecturing to you today on

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:36.170
Thursday, and maybe some facts
about the relationship between

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:39.530
that guy and this guy--or that
stage and this stage,

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:42.659
if we prefer to talk about it
that way.

00:49:42.659 --> 00:49:46.584
We can see how whether it's the
same person or not has to turn

00:49:46.584 --> 00:49:49.030
on the relations between the
stages.

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:54.949
But how could it possibly turn
on what's happening in Michigan?

00:49:54.949 --> 00:50:00.452
How can whether or not I am the
same guy as the guy who was

00:50:00.452 --> 00:50:05.764
lecturing to you on Tuesday
depend on what's happening in

00:50:05.764 --> 00:50:09.369
Pennsylvania or Australia or
Mars?

00:50:09.369 --> 00:50:15.273
To use some philosophical
jargon, the nature of identity

00:50:15.273 --> 00:50:21.928
seems like it should depend only
on intrinsic facts about me or

00:50:21.928 --> 00:50:29.119
perhaps relational facts about
the relations between my stages.

00:50:29.119 --> 00:50:34.638
But it shouldn't depend on
extrinsic, external facts about

00:50:34.638 --> 00:50:39.847
what's happening someplace else.
But if we accept the no

00:50:39.847 --> 00:50:43.348
branching rule,
we're saying whether or not

00:50:43.348 --> 00:50:48.349
we've got identity depends on
what's happening elsewhere.

00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:53.395
With the no branching rule,
identity ceases to be a

00:50:53.395 --> 00:50:58.405
strictly internal affair.
It becomes, in part,

00:50:58.405 --> 00:51:02.655
an external affair.
That's very,

00:51:02.655 --> 00:51:08.338
very hard to believe.
And if you're not prepared to

00:51:08.338 --> 00:51:12.496
believe it, it looks as though
you've got to give up on the

00:51:12.496 --> 00:51:16.510
personality view.
Last thought.

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:20.495
During all of these problems
for the personality theorist,

00:51:20.495 --> 00:51:23.852
the body theorist,
the fans of the body theorist,

00:51:23.852 --> 00:51:26.920
is standing there laughing.
"Ha!

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.376
You poor fools.
Look at all the problems you've

00:51:30.376 --> 00:51:32.269
got adopting the personality
theory.

00:51:32.269 --> 00:51:35.144
See how easy it is to duplicate
personalities,

00:51:35.144 --> 00:51:38.849
leading to these totally
implausible no branching rules.

00:51:38.849 --> 00:51:44.110
We can avoid all of that if we
become body theorists."

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:47.791
What we'll ask ourselves next
time is whether or not the body

00:51:47.791 --> 00:51:50.000
theorist is in a better
situation.

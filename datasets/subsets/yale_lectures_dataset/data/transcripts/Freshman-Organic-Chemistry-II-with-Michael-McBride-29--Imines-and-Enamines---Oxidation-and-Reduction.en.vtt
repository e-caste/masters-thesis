00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:03.667
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: So we're
talking about 

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:06.467
oxidizing and reducing 

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:09.133
reagents, and about alcohols,
and Grignard 

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.800
reactions to make them. 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.200
And if we have time at the end,
we'll get to a little bit 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.467
about green chemistry. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.433
I maybe should apologize a
little bit about the last 

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:21.667
question on the exam. 

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:23.033
I got carried away. 

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:26.833
I wanted to have something that
was relevant, at least 

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:28.500
historically relevant. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.867
So I could have chosen a better
NMR problem, probably. 

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:35.133
But I wanted to show you why
it's a neat story. 

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:40.567
So I showed you, during the
exam, this dissertation from 

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:43.467
the University of Michigan in
1921. 

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:47.933
And notice it's about the color
of free radicals. 

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:52.100
It was found originally that the
solutions were colored. 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.767
Have any of you ever had a
colored solution in lab? 

00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:59.867
Have any of you ever not had a
colored solution is lab? 

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:00.167
Right? 

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:01.333
They're always colored. 

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:05.200
So at first, people paid no
attention to it. 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.167
But after they got good at doing
it, they observed that 

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:13.067
the solutions were colored sort
of a reddish yellow. 

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:16.233
But when you swirled the thing,
the color went away. 

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:17.667
It was colorless. 

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:19.633
But then it came back. 

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:21.200
Then you swirled it again, it
went away. 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.800
Came back. 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.367
Went away, came back, went away,
came 

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:25.267
back, several times. 

00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:29.733
And so this was something that
required an explanation of 

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.267
what the color was and how it
went away. 

00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:35.833
So on page eight of this
dissertation, there's this 

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:39.800
thing up on top that has sort of
a complicated scheme-- 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.467
or it seemed so at the time, at
least-- 

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.033
to explain the color. 

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:46.700
So the idea is that A-- 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.267
what compound is A in this? 

00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:49.500
Can you see what it is?

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:54.467
STUDENT: Hexaphenylethane.

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.633
PROFESSOR: A, up at the top left
in the scheme. 

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:00.067
It's
triphenylmethyl-triphenylmethyl.

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:01.767
It's hexaphenylethane, right? 

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:04.933
That's what Gomberg set out to
make, remember? 

00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:08.167
And then what's to the right of
it, what's B? 

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:11.167
It's two triphenylmethyl
radicals. 

00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:14.133
That's what he decided he had
made, on the basis of their 

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.300
reactivity. 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.900
But he's drawn something else
here. 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.500
Down below it, he explains the
color by drawing what we would 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.933
regard as a resonance structure
of the free radical, 

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:32.567
which puts the radical out on
the paraposition of one of the 

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:36.700
benzene rings, and draws other
double bonds there. 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.167
And the theory then was that
when you had that double bond, 

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:45.767
and two double bonds conjugated
like that, that 

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:47.767
caused color. 

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:52.633
So he explained the color by
saying that it was what we 

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:56.000
would say a resonance form, but
he said in equilibrium, a 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.100
form that was colored. 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.967
And the idea was that the
radical was 

00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:02.833
colored, but very reactive. 

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:06.700
But it was in equilibrium with
the dimer, and the dimer was 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.067
not colored, like 

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:12.300
tetraphenylmethane was not
colored. 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.600
But the monomer reacts quickly
with oxygen. 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.733
So when you swirl the flask and
let oxygen get into the 

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:23.200
solution, it immediately
destroys the colored stuff-- 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.400
that in his opinion, the quinoid
form, these double 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.100
bonds, right, the resonance
structure we would say. But 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.667
it destroys the free radical,
then exhausts the oxygen. 

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:36.600
Right? 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.400
And then if you let it sit a
while, the color comes back, 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.033
because equilibrium between the
dimer and the monomer 

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:45.733
reestablishes itself, so the
color gets back. 

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:48.733
But if you swirl it again, you
get oxygen and it destroys it. 

00:03:48.733 --> 00:03:50.233
You can keep doing that until
you've 

00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:52.000
used up all the radical. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.033
So that's how color got into the
act. 

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:03.400
Now, the NMR I asked you to
explain, and a number of 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.733
people got it, is...The dimer of
triphenylmethyl was finally 

00:04:07.733 --> 00:04:12.100
measured by NMR in 1968. 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.033
And here's a spectrum of it. 

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:18.233
And you see, it can't possibly
be hexaphenylethane, because 

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:21.100
it's got one group of 25
hydrogens, another of 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.933
2, another of 2, and another of
1. 

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:25.133
Right? 

00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:27.633
So if we look at
hexaphenylethane, of course, 

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:29.667
it should have six phenyl
groups. 

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:31.133
Six times five is thirty. 

00:04:31.133 --> 00:04:32.867
There should just be that one
peak. 

00:04:32.867 --> 00:04:35.033
So this obviously isn't that. 

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:37.367
What is it? 

00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:41.300
That hexaphenylethane is the
product of alpha-alpha 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.333
coupling, the two radical
carbons coming together. 

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:46.300
But notice what could have
happened. 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.633
It's obviously not that. 

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:51.067
But if you had the
triphenylmethyl radical up 

00:04:51.067 --> 00:04:55.100
there at B, and if we use a line
instead of a dot to 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.400
denote the extra valence that's
not being used, and 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.133
over here, draw the resonance
structure, which has its extra 

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:06.067
valence out at the right, then
you could imagine--those, 

00:05:06.067 --> 00:05:08.533
of course, are just resonance
structures-- 

00:05:08.533 --> 00:05:11.367
but you can imagine two of them
coming together like that 

00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:13.567
to form this dimer. 

00:05:13.567 --> 00:05:15.000
So a different dimer. 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.500
What advantage would it have
over...what disadvantage would

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.733
it have compared to 

00:05:19.733 --> 00:05:22.133
hexaphenylethane? 

00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:23.600
How about this ring here? 

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:29.767
We've lost the aromatic
stability of the ring. 

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:33.600
What have we gained? 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.433
So that's a way in which this
dimer would be worse than 

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:39.900
hexaphenylethane. 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.733
Is there any way in
which it would be better?

00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:45.800
STUDENT: Less spheric hindrance.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.467
PROFESSOR: It's less spherically
hindered, right? 

00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:51.867
And spheric hindrance counts for
a lot in these things, 

00:05:51.867 --> 00:05:55.567
although that wasn't much
appreciated, really, until 

00:05:55.567 --> 00:05:59.033
after 1950 or so. 

00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:01.067
I mean, people had talked about
it since the time of 

00:06:01.067 --> 00:06:05.333
Viktor Meyer, but it really
didn't convince anyone that 

00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:07.633
you should think about another
dimer rather than 

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.233
hexaphenylethane. 

00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:13.733
So anyhow, if you consider this
structure, notice that 

00:06:13.733 --> 00:06:18.233
you have the explanation for two
hydrogens here, the blue 

00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:22.100
one, two hydrogens here, the
green ones, a hydrogen here, 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.633
the red one, and you have
coupling between these two of 

00:06:26.633 --> 00:06:30.600
about 10 Hz, so it's a double
doublet, right? 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.433
And it's distorted, though,
because this 60 MHz 

00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:37.300
spectrum, the chemical shift
difference, isn't large 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.600
compared to the J-coupling. 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.800
So the inner peaks are large,
and the outer peaks are small. 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.500
But if you look even more
carefully, you can see that 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.700
there's a 3 Hz coupling between
the red 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.733
hydrogen and the green. 

00:06:48.733 --> 00:06:50.567
There's a little bit of doublet
splitting here and a 

00:06:50.567 --> 00:06:52.900
little bit of doublet splitting
here. 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.233
It's hard to see. 

00:06:54.233 --> 00:06:57.500
And in fact, in some related
samples, you can see a little 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.967
coupling between this hydrogen
and that one, as well. 

00:06:59.967 --> 00:07:03.300
And these, therefore, are a
little bit split, but not 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.667
enough that you can see it. 

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.767
Why don't you see the splitting
in that one? 

00:07:06.767 --> 00:07:12.367
If A splits B, B should split A,
right? 

00:07:12.367 --> 00:07:16.200
Because this hydrogen is being
split into a triplet by these, 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.867
and into a small triplet by
these, only 3 Hz, and 

00:07:19.867 --> 00:07:23.267
then into even smaller triplets
by these. 

00:07:23.267 --> 00:07:25.633
So it's just a whole bunch of
peaks on top of one another 

00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:27.733
that just look like a lump out
here. 

00:07:27.733 --> 00:07:30.867
So it's quite clear what this
structure is, that it's this 

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:34.967
quinoid dimer, once you have the
NMR to see it. 

00:07:34.967 --> 00:07:38.367
So it's an alpha to para
coupling. 

00:07:38.367 --> 00:07:43.167
The central carbon, alpha,
right, with the para position 

00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:44.867
to one of the benzene rings,
which 

00:07:44.867 --> 00:07:47.867
avoids the styric hindrance. 

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:50.000
Now, how about the color? 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.033
Remember, the reason Gomberg
thought that it was this, was 

00:07:57.033 --> 00:08:00.167
that the radical was colored,
the stuff that went away 

00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:02.233
rapidly when you swirled it. 

00:08:02.233 --> 00:08:04.267
But the stuff that was in
equilibrium with 

00:08:04.267 --> 00:08:05.833
that was not colored. 

00:08:05.833 --> 00:08:09.167
That's why the color went away,
but came back again when 

00:08:09.167 --> 00:08:11.567
the equilibrium was
reestablished. 

00:08:11.567 --> 00:08:13.333
So the stuff it was in
equilibrium 

00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:15.267
with was not colored. 

00:08:15.267 --> 00:08:18.067
This, he thought, should be
colored. 

00:08:18.067 --> 00:08:18.500
Right? 

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.900
So he thought it couldn't be
that dimer. 

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.733
And he was almost right. 

00:08:23.733 --> 00:08:26.300
This is the UV spectrum of that
stuff. 

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.633
So it has quite a strong
absorbance here, 

00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:32.000
at 318 nm. 

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.767
But it peters out just at 395
nm. 

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:40.333
And as it turns out, the
ultraviolet, the invisible 

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:43.867
part of the spectrum, ends at
395 nm. 

00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:46.733
If it'd been 5 nm more, he would
have seen the 

00:08:46.733 --> 00:08:48.700
color of that with his eye. 

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.333
So he was close but no cigar on
that one, right? 

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:58.500
And because of that, for
whatever it was, 46 years, 

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.633
people had the wrong structure
of this important compound. 

00:09:02.633 --> 00:09:06.267
Now in fact, that's at minus 60
degrees where the 

00:09:06.267 --> 00:09:10.600
equilibrium lies toward the
dimer, away from the monomer. 

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.400
But if you warm to 21 degrees,
now you see the absorption 

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.133
from the monomer. 

00:09:16.133 --> 00:09:19.733
There's enough of it to see. 

00:09:19.733 --> 00:09:24.967
That's at 513 nm. 

00:09:24.967 --> 00:09:28.233
And the reason it's colored is
not because it has this 

00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:32.367
quinoid structure, which was his
theory, but because it has 

00:09:32.367 --> 00:09:34.633
a non-bonding SOMO. 

00:09:34.633 --> 00:09:38.100
So normally you have bonding and
anti-bonding orbitals. 

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.333
pi and pi* are conjugated ones,
right? 

00:09:41.333 --> 00:09:44.133
But this one has a non-bonding
orbital right in the middle, 

00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:48.733
so a much smaller gap, so the
energy is much lower of the 

00:09:48.733 --> 00:09:51.100
quantum that gets absorbed by
the free radical. 

00:09:54.433 --> 00:10:01.133
Now, this was published, that
thesis that appeared here, was 

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:03.667
published the next year in the
Journal of the American 

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:07.267
Chemical Society, almost word
for word, about the color of 

00:10:07.267 --> 00:10:09.467
the free radicals. 

00:10:09.467 --> 00:10:12.167
And this is a passage of that. 

00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:16.733
It says, "The relationship
between color and constitution 

00:10:16.733 --> 00:10:19.867
of triphenylmethyl are, briefly
stated, the following. 

00:10:19.867 --> 00:10:23.533
First, that you have a colored
free radical in equilibrium 

00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:24.633
with the dimer"-- 

00:10:24.633 --> 00:10:26.833
hexaphenylethane, right?-- 

00:10:26.833 --> 00:10:30.100
"and second, the color is
attributed to the quinoid 

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.933
tautomer"-- 

00:10:30.933 --> 00:10:32.700
we would now say resonance
structure-- 

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.233
"C." So the color was attributed
to that. 

00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:39.833
But notice what's interesting
about taking this paper from 

00:10:39.833 --> 00:10:44.000
the dissertation to the printed
form in the Journal of 

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.733
the American Chemical Society,
the published form? 

00:10:47.733 --> 00:10:49.000
What got left out? 

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.433
The correct structure of the
dimer. 

00:10:58.433 --> 00:11:03.700
So it was intentionally left out
because of the color thing. 

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.700
The correct dimer was dropped
for 46 years because they 

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.900
thought it should be colored. 

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.733
And it just almost was. 

00:11:10.733 --> 00:11:12.900
So I think that's an interesting
application of 

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.467
spectroscopy. 

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:15.900
OK. 

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.967
Now, third thoughts on the
Friedel-Crafts reaction. 

00:11:18.967 --> 00:11:22.233
Remember, we had thoughts, we
had second thoughts, now we 

00:11:22.233 --> 00:11:23.800
have third thoughts. 

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.900
And the second thoughts, just to
remind you, was that when 

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.200
you do a Friedel-Crafts
reaction, you could imagine 

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.167
Benzene being a nucleophile and
displacing chloride from 

00:11:35.167 --> 00:11:39.333
n-propyl to give n-propyl
benzene, and that would be an 

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:40.900
SN2 reaction. 

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.833
Or you could imagine if it broke
the bond a little more 

00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:46.833
that the hydride could shift,
and you'd get isopropyl, 

00:11:46.833 --> 00:11:51.633
either with an aluminum chloride
tightly associated 

00:11:51.633 --> 00:11:53.200
with it, or since it's a
secondary 

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.733
cation, maybe much looser. 

00:11:55.733 --> 00:11:58.333
So that would be like an SN1
reaction that allowed the 

00:11:58.333 --> 00:11:59.433
rearrangement. 

00:11:59.433 --> 00:12:02.633
But then we wondered, what would
happen if we rotated it and 

00:12:02.633 --> 00:12:07.500
had a methide shift instead of a
hydride shift? 

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.533
Then, if we had the
rearrangement, we'd get the 

00:12:10.533 --> 00:12:11.567
same thing back again. 

00:12:11.567 --> 00:12:13.533
It would still give n-propyl. 

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:17.667
So the question is, is it SN2 or
is it SN1? 

00:12:17.667 --> 00:12:20.833
And then there was this
additional complication that 

00:12:20.833 --> 00:12:25.167
if the methyl got stuck halfway
in a cyclopropyl--protonated 

00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:28.767
cyclopropane structure, that
still would give 

00:12:28.767 --> 00:12:30.133
the n-propyl benzene. 

00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:33.667
And in fact, Dino found in 1968
that you did that, and 

00:12:33.667 --> 00:12:36.200
that it was randomly
distributed, because the 

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.333
hydrogen can zip around the
periphery of the protonated 

00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:40.767
cyclopropane. 

00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:41.133
OK. 

00:12:41.133 --> 00:12:44.200
So then I posed to you a way to
become famous, a problem. 

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.367
How to decide whether the
Friedel-Crafts reaction really 

00:12:49.367 --> 00:12:52.933
is an SN2, where benzene is a
nucleophile and displaces 

00:12:52.933 --> 00:12:55.967
chloride from a thing like this,
either before or after 

00:12:55.967 --> 00:12:59.700
the methide shift, or whether
it's an SN1 reaction. 

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.633
Did anyone have an idea how to
solve that? 

00:13:07.033 --> 00:13:08.133
Yeah, Matt? 

00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:09.467
STUDENT: Use deuterium. 

00:13:09.467 --> 00:13:12.367
PROFESSOR: We could label to see
where the deuterium ends 

00:13:12.367 --> 00:13:14.167
up in the n-propyl. 

00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:17.633
And what I've found since I
posed you this way to become 

00:13:17.633 --> 00:13:21.333
famous was that somebody
actually did that experiment. 

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:21.767
Right? 

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:25.667
It was done two years later, in
1970, and it didn't make 

00:13:25.667 --> 00:13:28.167
them famous. 

00:13:28.167 --> 00:13:32.267
The paper has been cited only
twice in the succeeding 40 

00:13:32.267 --> 00:13:34.600
years or whatever. 

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.567
And it was done by Lee and
Woodcock in 

00:13:36.567 --> 00:13:38.900
Saskatchewan in 1970. 

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.433
So they prepared the one with
deuterium here, and they did 

00:13:42.433 --> 00:13:45.633
the reaction with aluminum
chloride right at 

00:13:45.633 --> 00:13:47.433
5 degrees centigrade for 45
minutes. 

00:13:47.433 --> 00:13:49.900
That's near the freezing point
of benzene, so it's about as 

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.133
cold as you can get, if you're
going to use 

00:13:51.133 --> 00:13:52.667
benzene is a solvent. 

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:55.767
They also did it with another
inert solvent. 

00:13:55.767 --> 00:13:59.100
The idea is that the nucleophile
would be more 

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.367
dilute the benzene that's doing
the thing. 

00:14:01.367 --> 00:14:04.733
So it would slow down the
displacement reaction if it 

00:14:04.733 --> 00:14:06.933
were an SN2. 

00:14:06.933 --> 00:14:07.633
OK. 

00:14:07.633 --> 00:14:15.267
So what would you expect if it
had been an SN2 reaction 

00:14:15.267 --> 00:14:17.100
without any rearrangement? 

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.667
If it had just been benzene
being a nucleophile. 

00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:21.967
The only thing aluminum chloride
does is help the 

00:14:21.967 --> 00:14:24.033
chloride be a good leaving
group. 

00:14:24.033 --> 00:14:28.033
Then where would the deuterium
end up? 

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:29.767
Here, here, here; 

00:14:29.767 --> 00:14:31.033
one, two, three. 

00:14:34.033 --> 00:14:35.033
Ashvin, what do you say? 

00:14:35.033 --> 00:14:36.233
You just did the exam. 

00:14:36.233 --> 00:14:40.000
You should be primed on this. 

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.200
STUDENT: Next to the ring. 

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.733
PROFESSOR: It should be here,
right? 

00:14:43.733 --> 00:14:46.633
Because if benzene just comes
and attacks this carbon, and 

00:14:46.633 --> 00:14:50.400
chloride leaves, then the
deuterium should all be there. 

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.133
What if it undergoes a methide
shift? 

00:14:55.133 --> 00:15:00.867
Then where would it be, Ashvin?
The deuterium, 

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:04.400
remember, started here. 

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.733
And then the methide shifted, if
that's the mechanism. 

00:15:07.733 --> 00:15:08.433
Yeah? 

00:15:08.433 --> 00:15:09.200
STUDENT: In the middle. 

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.867
PROFESSOR: Then it would be
here, right? 

00:15:11.867 --> 00:15:16.867
And what if it went through a
protonated cyclopropane?

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.467
STUDENT: Scrambled. 

00:15:22.467 --> 00:15:23.700
PROFESSOR: Then it would be
scrambled. 

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.133
We already know what protonated

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:26.133
cyclopropane would be. 

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:29.133
So now by studying where the
deuterium is, we should be 

00:15:29.133 --> 00:15:33.667
able to figure out what the
mechanism is to give n-propyl 

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:36.333
benzene with n-propyl chloride.

00:15:36.333 --> 00:15:39.400
And what they found was that 90%
of the product was 

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.300
dideuterated there, and none of
it was 

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.467
dideuterated elsewhere. 

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:50.000
So it really is the case, then,
that there's less than 

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.667
2% of partial or full methide
shift 

00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:56.467
en route to n-propyl benzene. 

00:15:56.467 --> 00:15:59.667
It's just the simplest thing you
think, that it forms by a 

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:04.633
benzene nucleophile doing an SN2
reaction. 

00:16:04.633 --> 00:16:07.233
Now, why isn't it 100%? 

00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:11.867
Because other cations are able
to abstract hydride from this 

00:16:11.867 --> 00:16:16.333
position to make this cation
here, and then the deuteriums 

00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:18.233
get washed out of the molecule.

00:16:18.233 --> 00:16:22.333
But anyhow, that's what they
found. 

00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:25.933
So you'll have to find out some
other way to become 

00:16:25.933 --> 00:16:30.033
famous as an organic chemist. 

00:16:30.033 --> 00:16:33.500
Now, at the end last time, we
were doing oxidation and 

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.167
reduction as bookkeeping. 

00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:39.667
Not because there's anything
real about it, but because it 

00:16:39.667 --> 00:16:42.167
can help us to classify
reagents. 

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.967
We've been classifying reagents
as 

00:16:43.967 --> 00:16:45.867
high HOMOs, low LUMOs. 

00:16:45.867 --> 00:16:48.567
Weak bonds, for example, if you
want to get a 

00:16:48.567 --> 00:16:51.300
free-radical reaction. 

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.000
But there's a completely
different way of classifying 

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.633
them, in a sense, a very
artificial way, as to whether 

00:16:57.633 --> 00:16:59.533
they're oxidizing or reducing
agents. 

00:16:59.533 --> 00:17:02.233
So we went through a whole bunch
of reagents and 

00:17:02.233 --> 00:17:03.567
classified them. 

00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:09.700
As oxidizing reagents, the
elemental halogen, disulfide, 

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.333
chromium trioxide. 

00:17:11.333 --> 00:17:15.433
Reducing agents, methane is a
reducing agent. 

00:17:15.433 --> 00:17:18.333
But it's not very reactive,
because it doesn't have good 

00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:20.133
HOMOs or LUMOs. 

00:17:20.133 --> 00:17:23.233
Free radicals are what we need
to get a foothold on that. 

00:17:23.233 --> 00:17:25.967
Or lithium aluminum hydride, H
minus. 

00:17:25.967 --> 00:17:29.267
NaH, potassium metal, which can
give up 

00:17:29.267 --> 00:17:35.533
electrons. And RSH can give up H
minus. 

00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:38.533
And we saw that when you
oxidized back and forth 

00:17:38.533 --> 00:17:43.467
between disulfide and thiol. 

00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:47.267
But HCl and KCl, the elements
are in their normal oxidation 

00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:49.833
states, so they're neither
oxidizing or reducing. 

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:52.767
And just at the end, we got to
water and showed that in 

00:17:52.767 --> 00:17:56.767
water, hydrogen is +1 and oxygen
is -2. 

00:17:56.767 --> 00:17:58.000
So it's neither. 

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.200
And in fact you can see that in
the reaction of water with 

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.967
ethylene, catalyzed by acid. 

00:18:08.967 --> 00:18:13.800
The carbon is -2, -2 for
ethylene. 

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:19.133
After you've added, it's -1, -3.

00:18:19.133 --> 00:18:22.333
So one carbon got oxidized, but
the 

00:18:22.333 --> 00:18:23.933
other carbon got reduced. 

00:18:23.933 --> 00:18:27.567
And there's no net change, so
you don't need either an 

00:18:27.567 --> 00:18:31.800
oxidizing or a reducing agent,
because there's no net change 

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.867
in the oxidation step. 

00:18:32.867 --> 00:18:35.000
So water can do that. 

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.533
But water does work in
oxidizing-reducing scenarios. 

00:18:41.533 --> 00:18:43.900
And in particular, a very
important one,

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.867
photosynthesis, changes-

00:18:45.867 --> 00:18:51.867
oxidizes water to O2, but at the
same time reduces the 

00:18:51.867 --> 00:18:55.433
hydrogen in water to the
equivalent of H minus. 

00:18:55.433 --> 00:18:59.000
And that's NAD takes up the H to
become NADH. 

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.333
And remember, we've talked about
that being a source of 

00:19:01.333 --> 00:19:03.500
hydride, H minus. 

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.300
So it gets both oxidized and
reduced. 

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:11.933
So not all reducing agents would
work satisfactorily for 

00:19:11.933 --> 00:19:13.467
any given reaction. 

00:19:13.467 --> 00:19:17.167
But it's typically futile to try
a reagent 

00:19:17.167 --> 00:19:18.667
from the wrong class. 

00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:22.233
You don't usually use bromine if
you need to do reduction. 

00:19:22.233 --> 00:19:22.533
Right? 

00:19:22.533 --> 00:19:25.500
Or hydrogen chloride if you need
to do either 

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.600
oxidation or reduction. 

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.333
So it can be a big help in
narrowing the field, in 

00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:33.100
choosing reagents. 

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.233
Now, I wanted to go to the board
a little bit to show 

00:19:37.233 --> 00:19:38.833
oxidation states. 

00:19:38.833 --> 00:19:43.333
This was done in the class last
year by Professor Siegel 

00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:44.333
from Zurich. 

00:19:44.333 --> 00:19:47.600
But I thought it was handy to
do, and I will do it again on 

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.867
the board here. 

00:19:53.767 --> 00:19:55.800
So let me just put this screen
up. 

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.867
OK. 

00:20:23.867 --> 00:20:27.333
So we've talked about
arranging-- 

00:20:32.167 --> 00:20:33.433
there's one other set. 

00:20:36.667 --> 00:20:39.033
There we go. 

00:20:39.033 --> 00:20:45.067
Now, he chose to use CH4, CH3OH,
CH2O formic acid and CO2 

00:20:45.067 --> 00:20:48.133
as examples of oxidation levels
of carbon. 

00:20:48.133 --> 00:20:50.133
Let's just do it a little
differently, not that it's 

00:20:50.133 --> 00:20:54.600
better or worse, but let's just
have an R on there. 

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.833
So we could have RCH3. 

00:20:58.667 --> 00:21:00.700
What's the oxidation level of
the carbon? 

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.167
Remember how we do the
bookkeeping? 

00:21:07.167 --> 00:21:11.400
If you have another carbon
attached to it, they share the 

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.067
pair of electrons evenly-- 

00:21:13.067 --> 00:21:15.833
no contribution to oxidation
state. 

00:21:15.833 --> 00:21:19.133
But if it's hydrogen, hydrogen
gives its electron to carbon 

00:21:19.133 --> 00:21:24.700
in making the bond, so this
carbon will be +3.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.533
STUDENT: -3

00:21:25.533 --> 00:21:34.400
PROFESSOR: Oh, -3 pardon me.
Thanks for being on your toes.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.900
Then we could have RCH2OH. 

00:21:43.733 --> 00:21:46.333
So the oxygen cancels one of the
carbons, so this 

00:21:46.333 --> 00:21:47.733
will be -1. 

00:21:47.733 --> 00:21:50.700
Notice we're going in steps of
two here, right? 

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.267
It's the same when up there, but
I've decided to put an R 

00:21:54.267 --> 00:21:57.733
on, instead of one of the Hs,
just for variety. 

00:21:57.733 --> 00:22:08.733
So now RCH=O. Now it's +1,
because you 

00:22:08.733 --> 00:22:10.933
have two oxygens, one hydrogen.

00:22:10.933 --> 00:22:13.467
Then we could go RCOOH. 

00:22:19.267 --> 00:22:20.867
A carboxylic acid. 

00:22:20.867 --> 00:22:22.333
Now it's +3. 

00:22:25.833 --> 00:22:28.900
And at the very end, you can go
to CO2. 

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.300
Then you don't have the R in
there. 

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.867
And that's +4, as it says up
there. 

00:22:33.867 --> 00:22:34.167
OK. 

00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:39.733
Now let's look at different
classes of compounds at their 

00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:41.833
levels of oxidation. 

00:22:41.833 --> 00:22:43.100
So we could have alkanes. 

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:49.467
So we could have-- 

00:22:53.267 --> 00:22:57.100
well, we've already got RCH3. 

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.633
That's -3, so we'll check that
one. 

00:23:00.633 --> 00:23:07.000
Now, can we have an alkane which
has the oxidation state 

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.900
of carbon -1? 

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:15.867
It would be a carbon that has
all bonds to carbon, right, 

00:23:15.867 --> 00:23:18.767
except one bond to hydrogen. 

00:23:18.767 --> 00:23:27.700
So the way to do that would be
to have RCH=CHR. 

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.933
So an alkene.[correction: alkane
would be R3CH] 

00:23:37.367 --> 00:23:40.000
And then we could go to alkyne.

00:23:42.833 --> 00:23:44.067
R, C, C, R. 

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.933
So this would be alkyne. 

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.933
And each of these is -1. 

00:23:56.933 --> 00:23:59.200
Overall it's -2. 

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.633
And each of these is zero. 

00:24:05.867 --> 00:24:12.800
Now, what this means is that if
you wanted to get an 

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.333
alkene, it has the same
oxidation 

00:24:16.333 --> 00:24:18.333
level as the alcohol. 

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.367
I got that right? 

00:24:25.033 --> 00:24:26.567
Actually, I should have worked
this through 

00:24:26.567 --> 00:24:27.833
better ahead of time. 

00:24:31.733 --> 00:24:34.300
That one works better in his
scheme. 

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:40.300
But notice that you can... or
another alkene would be RCH=CH2.

00:24:47.667 --> 00:24:51.367
So this one, you can get from
here just by 

00:24:51.367 --> 00:24:53.500
a reaction we know. 

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.267
What's the reaction that would
go from the 

00:24:57.267 --> 00:24:58.533
alcohol to the alkene? 

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:03.433
How do you get there from here?

00:25:03.433 --> 00:25:04.700
What do you call that reaction?

00:25:07.433 --> 00:25:09.533
To start with an alkane...

00:25:09.533 --> 00:25:10.033
Pardon me. 

00:25:10.033 --> 00:25:16.333
This will be R', because this C
is part of the R here. 

00:25:16.333 --> 00:25:19.667
So this one involves an
elimination reaction. 

00:25:19.667 --> 00:25:20.833
You just treat it with acid. 

00:25:20.833 --> 00:25:23.033
You don't need an oxidizing or
reducing agent. 

00:25:26.933 --> 00:25:37.200
So the idea is that you can go
down this way with neither, 

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.033
but if you have to go back and
forth this way, you do 

00:25:41.033 --> 00:25:47.467
oxidation or reduction. 

00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:56.733
So you could have alkyl halides.

00:26:04.867 --> 00:26:08.933
So here you would have RX. 

00:26:08.933 --> 00:26:14.800
And the carbon in the RX would
be -1. 

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.900
The carbon that's attached to
the X, that is, the X...X-ness 

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.933
of it is -1.[correction: the
X-ness is +1 for carbon] 

00:26:20.933 --> 00:26:23.300
I should make it RCH2, sorry. 

00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:35.633
And how do we get, say, the
bromide from the alcohol? 

00:26:38.133 --> 00:26:41.567
What reagent do we use? 

00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:46.700
PBr3, or the chloride? SOCl2. 

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.300
These are not oxidizing or
reducing agents, right? 

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.067
The elements are in their normal
thing. 

00:26:51.067 --> 00:26:54.900
So we can go down without using
an 

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.500
oxidizing or reducing agent. 

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.833
Now, how could we get from here,
from an 

00:27:01.833 --> 00:27:05.233
alkane, over to here? 

00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:07.733
How would you put bromine in,
say? 

00:27:07.733 --> 00:27:10.633
What reagent would you use? If
you had an alkane and wanted 

00:27:10.633 --> 00:27:11.867
to make an alkyl bromide? 

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.000
What reagent? 

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.467
STUDENT: PBr3 

00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:19.133
PROFESSOR: No. 

00:27:19.133 --> 00:27:20.333
That's very good. 

00:27:20.333 --> 00:27:23.600
If you have an alkane, so C-H
bonds, and you 

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.867
want to make C-Br-- 

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.267
Anybody remember a reaction to
do that? 

00:27:31.267 --> 00:27:34.267
What's the problem in
reacting an alkane?

00:27:35.733 --> 00:27:36.600
STUDENT: They're not reactive 

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.367
PROFESSOR: They're not reactive.

00:27:37.367 --> 00:27:38.567
Why not? 

00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:40.867
No high HOMOs, low LUMOs. 

00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:42.167
No functional group. 

00:27:42.167 --> 00:27:44.667
How do you get at something
that's not a functional group? 

00:27:44.667 --> 00:27:47.233
How do you get at the hydrogens?

00:27:47.233 --> 00:27:48.500
You can't use HOMOs and LUMOs. 

00:27:55.033 --> 00:27:58.267
How would you change methane
into methyl bromide? 

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.267
STUDENT: Br2 plus initiator. 

00:28:02.267 --> 00:28:04.533
PROFESSOR: Br2, Cl2. 

00:28:04.533 --> 00:28:07.333
It's a free-radical chain
reaction. 

00:28:07.333 --> 00:28:08.900
But notice the things you're
using. 

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:13.233
Br2, Cl2 are oxidizing agents. 

00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:15.933
So to go across in this
direction, from one column to 

00:28:15.933 --> 00:28:19.933
the next, you need oxidation. 

00:28:19.933 --> 00:28:23.133
Or you could do another
oxidation, and get RCHX2. 

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.600
And that would require from
here, doing a second 

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.033
free-radical substitution. 

00:28:32.033 --> 00:28:35.733
But if you came down from the
aldehyde to get there, it's 

00:28:35.733 --> 00:28:37.567
the same oxidation level. 

00:28:37.567 --> 00:28:41.533
So you don't need something like
bromine to get from here 

00:28:41.533 --> 00:28:42.800
down to here. 

00:28:45.333 --> 00:28:47.267
We could do alcohols, too. 

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.367
And of course, we could go also
to the 

00:28:53.367 --> 00:29:00.433
tribromide, RCX3, say. 

00:29:00.433 --> 00:29:06.867
And that we could get from an
acid, without using an 

00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:08.900
oxidizing or reducing agent. 

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.233
But if we have to get it from
anything over here, from an 

00:29:11.233 --> 00:29:15.033
alcohol or from an aldehyde, we
have to do oxidation to get 

00:29:15.033 --> 00:29:16.967
that, somewhere. 

00:29:16.967 --> 00:29:21.367
And the ultimate one is like
CO2, would be carbon 

00:29:21.367 --> 00:29:22.967
tetrachloride, for example. 

00:29:22.967 --> 00:29:25.900
That's the completely oxidized
form. 

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.100
Or if we have alkyl
halides, alcohols,

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:37.200
here we had an
alcohol.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.000
But suppose we made a diol. 

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.933
R, C, (OH)2, and with H in here.

00:29:46.933 --> 00:29:50.800
RCH(OH)2. 

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.000
If we've started from an alcohol
to get that, we have 

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.233
to do an oxidation, choose an
oxidizing agent. 

00:29:56.233 --> 00:30:01.300
But if we could make it from an
aldehyde without using an 

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.033
oxidizing or reducing agent, can
you think of any way of 

00:30:04.033 --> 00:30:07.133
going from an aldehyde to a
carbon that has 

00:30:07.133 --> 00:30:08.400
two alcohols on it? 

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.700
Do you remember what you call a
carbon that 

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.167
has two OHs on it?

00:30:17.167 --> 00:30:17.633
STUDENT: A gem-diol.

00:30:17.633 --> 00:30:18.433
PROFESSOR: A gem-diol. 

00:30:18.433 --> 00:30:19.700
Where do you get it? 

00:30:22.033 --> 00:30:23.300
STUDENT: Umm... 

00:30:28.533 --> 00:30:30.733
PROFESSOR: So we need to do an
oxidation, like bromine or 

00:30:30.733 --> 00:30:33.567
something like that? 

00:30:33.567 --> 00:30:33.767
No. 

00:30:33.767 --> 00:30:35.867
We immediately see you don't,
because they're in the same 

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:37.367
column, right? 

00:30:37.367 --> 00:30:40.967
It's the same oxidation level. 

00:30:40.967 --> 00:30:44.767
So you remember how you make a
diol from a-- 

00:30:44.767 --> 00:30:47.733
let's do that here. 

00:30:47.733 --> 00:30:53.433
R, C, OH, and I want to get R,
C, OH,OH, H. 

00:31:00.933 --> 00:31:02.933
What do I do first?
Derek?

00:31:03.867 --> 00:31:04.667
STUDENT: Protonate the oxygen.	 

00:31:04.667 --> 00:31:07.433
PROFESSOR: Protonate the oxygen.

00:31:07.433 --> 00:31:08.533
Plus charge here.

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:11.833
STUDENT: And then an OH minus
comes and attacks this.

00:31:11.833 --> 00:31:12.633
PROFESSOR: OH minus. 

00:31:12.633 --> 00:31:15.133
So we've added H plus, OH minus.

00:31:15.133 --> 00:31:18.300
It's more likely, if you're
using acid catalysis, that 

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.100
there's very little OH minus
around, right? 

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.200
Because the acid would have
reacted with it. 

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.900
So what would you normally use
to come in to make the 

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.667
C-O bond down here?

00:31:29.667 --> 00:31:30.867
STUDENT: Water.

00:31:30.867 --> 00:31:31.967
PROFESSOR: Water. 

00:31:31.967 --> 00:31:33.167
And then lose a proton. 

00:31:33.167 --> 00:31:36.333
So the proton is just a
catalyst. 

00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:40.833
But notice what we're using is
just water. 

00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:42.967
And H plus catalysis. 

00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:46.000
Or OH minus catalysis, too. 

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.533
You could have hydroxide add
first, and then this pulls a 

00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:51.167
proton off water. 

00:31:51.167 --> 00:31:51.467
OK. 

00:31:51.467 --> 00:31:56.433
So you go up and down using just
water and acid. 

00:31:56.433 --> 00:31:58.333
Things that aren't oxidizing or
reducing agents. 

00:31:58.333 --> 00:32:01.667
So you can see how that might
work out, that if you that 

00:32:01.667 --> 00:32:07.400
create on your study sheet a
list of oxidation levels of 

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:12.467
things, then you could see, when
you're faced with a given 

00:32:12.467 --> 00:32:16.367
problem, whether--what kind of
reagent you need to choose. 

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:19.400
And if you can simplify to a
third of the reagents you 

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.233
know, that's a big help. 

00:32:22.233 --> 00:32:22.633
OK, 

00:32:22.633 --> 00:32:25.900
now. So that's just the
bookkeeping. 

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.133
There's also the question of the
mechanism by 

00:32:28.133 --> 00:32:28.967
which you do this. 

00:32:28.967 --> 00:32:32.700
So let's just consider BR2 as an
oxidizing agent. 

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:38.800
So if you have an alkane, RCH3,
say, and you react it 

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:47.767
with BR2 to get an oxidized
form, RCH2Br, what's the 

00:32:47.767 --> 00:32:50.167
mechanism by which you do it? 

00:32:50.167 --> 00:32:51.067
We just did this. 

00:32:51.067 --> 00:32:52.400
Chris? 

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.867
STUDENT: Free Radical. 

00:32:53.867 --> 00:32:55.533
PROFESSOR: It's a free-radical
one, right? 

00:32:55.533 --> 00:33:00.667
So we get Br*, taking the
hydrogen, and 

00:33:00.667 --> 00:33:03.167
we've done this before. 

00:33:03.167 --> 00:33:04.533
Get the radical, and then 

00:33:04.533 --> 00:33:05.967
free-radical chain reactions. 

00:33:05.967 --> 00:33:08.967
So bromine is an oxidizing
agent, but acting as SOMO. 

00:33:08.967 --> 00:33:11.667
It's different with alcohols. 

00:33:11.667 --> 00:33:17.600
Suppose we have Br2, and we want
to 

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.833
react it with an alcohol. 

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.067
How does the reaction begin? 

00:33:29.067 --> 00:33:31.900
I mean, it would be possible to
do it by a free-radical 

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.867
reaction, right? 

00:33:32.867 --> 00:33:36.467
If you put in an initiator, and
get change going, it would be 

00:33:36.467 --> 00:33:37.200
possible to do it. 

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:42.200
But there's a better reaction to
react Br2 with ethanol. 

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.467
And how does that begin? 

00:33:47.933 --> 00:33:49.900
Amy, what makes Br2 reactive? 

00:33:56.633 --> 00:33:59.800
High HOMO, low LUMO? 

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.000
What's high HOMO?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.600
STUDENT: Unshared pairs.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.433
PROFESSOR: Unshared pairs. 

00:34:03.433 --> 00:34:04.700
What's low LUMO? 

00:34:09.133 --> 00:34:11.000
There are not many
orbitals there.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
STUDENT: Sigma*. 

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.033
PROFESSOR: Sigma*. 

00:34:13.033 --> 00:34:13.300
OK. 

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.467
So we've got sigma* here. 

00:34:16.467 --> 00:34:19.333
And what's high HOMO, then, of
the alcohol? Amy?

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.333
STUDENT: The lone pair on the O.

00:34:23.333 --> 00:34:25.900
PROFESSOR: OK. So lone pair on
the O. Let's see how these work.

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:35.567
STUDENT: It attacks the sigma*
and takes one of the Br's. 

00:34:35.567 --> 00:34:36.500
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:42.300
I want to do this with a red...

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.567
Actually, that's no better red
than the other one. 

00:34:45.567 --> 00:34:46.600
OK. 

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.033
So this comes in here, and these
leave. And we've seen 

00:34:51.033 --> 00:34:52.867
things like this forever. 

00:34:52.867 --> 00:34:54.100
So we have HOBr. 

00:34:56.467 --> 00:35:00.900
And let me write this with this
unshared pair, just to be 

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.133
cumbersome about it. 

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.633
And bromide came away, and
there's a plus charge here. 

00:35:25.533 --> 00:35:26.933
How do we get rid of the plus
charge? 

00:35:26.933 --> 00:35:29.867
Amy, you're doing this here. 

00:35:29.867 --> 00:35:30.767
STUDENT: Will the H leave? 

00:35:30.767 --> 00:35:31.433
PROFESSOR: Yeah. 

00:35:31.433 --> 00:35:33.900
The proton will go away. 

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:39.033
So now we've got O, Br-- 

00:35:39.033 --> 00:35:41.433
I was going to make that-- 

00:35:41.433 --> 00:35:42.667
CH2CH3. 

00:35:50.967 --> 00:35:56.967
And here we've got this, that
pair. 

00:35:56.967 --> 00:35:59.500
And now can you see anything
that this might do? 

00:36:07.133 --> 00:36:10.933
What reactions have we seen when
we have atoms next to one 

00:36:10.933 --> 00:36:14.167
another, bromine on one,
hydrogen on the other?

00:36:15.333 --> 00:36:16.667
STUDENT: Undergo E2.

00:36:16.667 --> 00:36:17.333
PROFESSOR: Pardon me?

00:36:17.333 --> 00:36:17.633
STUDENT: Undergo E2. 

00:36:17.633 --> 00:36:18.967
PROFESSOR: An E2 reaction. 

00:36:18.967 --> 00:36:20.433
So we have some base. 

00:36:20.433 --> 00:36:21.933
It doesn't have to be a strong
base. 

00:36:21.933 --> 00:36:23.367
It could just be the alcohol. 

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.333
Or it could be the bromide that
we lost here. 

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.633
So this can take the H, this
goes in, 

00:36:39.633 --> 00:36:43.067
and these go on the bromine. 

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:55.767
So now we have double bond O.
This H is still there. 

00:36:55.767 --> 00:36:57.033
CH3. 

00:36:59.767 --> 00:37:06.700
And bromide, which has that pair
of electrons. 

00:37:10.767 --> 00:37:16.167
So we've oxidized the alcohol to
the aldehyde. 

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:17.700
We've gone from here to here. 

00:37:22.467 --> 00:37:24.800
And notice what the trick was. 

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.167
The first oxidations and
reductions we talked about 

00:37:27.167 --> 00:37:30.633
were electron transfer, an
actual electron transfer, like 

00:37:30.633 --> 00:37:34.200
from a metal to a sigma* bond of
an 

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.333
alkyl halide, right? 

00:37:36.333 --> 00:37:39.033
Here we're ferring electrons,
but in pairs. 

00:37:39.033 --> 00:37:42.267
The electrons start belonging to
the oxygen. 

00:37:42.267 --> 00:37:45.233
Then they're shared between the
oxygen and the bromine, 

00:37:45.233 --> 00:37:47.200
and then they leave with the
bromine. 

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.133
So the bromine came in and
shared a pair of electrons, 

00:37:52.133 --> 00:37:55.933
then went away, carrying them
away. 

00:37:55.933 --> 00:37:58.067
So it removed this pair of
electrons. 

00:37:58.067 --> 00:38:00.100
That's how the oxidation
occurred. 

00:38:07.867 --> 00:38:14.167
So these reactions are just...
This is an SN2 reaction 

00:38:14.167 --> 00:38:15.833
and this is an E2 reaction. 

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.433
So they're just normal
mechanisms, but because of the 

00:38:21.433 --> 00:38:24.833
way we look at it, it's an
oxidation-reduction reaction. 

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.833
And now CrO3, Cr6. 

00:38:43.833 --> 00:38:47.633
It reminds you a little bit of a
ketone. 

00:38:47.633 --> 00:38:48.033
Right? 

00:38:48.033 --> 00:38:49.300
this Cr=O. 

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:54.633
So you can imagine adding water
to give Cr, O, O, OH, OH. 

00:39:02.933 --> 00:39:04.233
What's the oxidation state? 

00:39:04.233 --> 00:39:06.900
If the chromium is oxidation
state here, what's its 

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.333
oxidation state here?

00:39:09.333 --> 00:39:09.567
STUDENT: +6

00:39:09.567 --> 00:39:12.067
PROFESSOR: +6. 

00:39:12.067 --> 00:39:13.967
What's its oxidation state here?

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.867
STUDENT: Still +6 

00:39:17.867 --> 00:39:19.133
PROFESSOR: How do you know? 

00:39:19.133 --> 00:39:21.133
You could add up all the bonds.

00:39:21.133 --> 00:39:23.900
But if you used water, it's
going to be the same oxidation 

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.300
state, because water's not an
oxidizing agent. 

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.433
So it's still +6. 

00:39:28.433 --> 00:39:35.033
Or you could imagine having two
of these-- so these are a 

00:39:35.033 --> 00:39:36.867
little bit like alcohols. 

00:39:36.867 --> 00:39:39.400
You could imagine to make an
ether from that. 

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:47.067
So you could have CrOCr, right,
with OOHOH-- 

00:39:51.533 --> 00:39:53.033
wait a second, O here-- 

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.733
O, O, OH. 

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:04.800
So this is chromium trioxide,
chromic acid, 

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.200
dichromate, and so on. 

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.833
So there are lots of different
forms. Or you can get, if you 

00:40:09.833 --> 00:40:18.800
reacted it with HCl, you could
protonate, lose water, add the 

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.300
chlorine instead. 

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.533
See, you could get Cr, O, O, O,
Cl, OH. 

00:40:28.133 --> 00:40:31.333
But all of these are just
different disguises of the 

00:40:31.333 --> 00:40:35.033
same thing, Cr6. 

00:40:35.033 --> 00:40:38.833
Now let's consider the reaction
of any of these with 

00:40:38.833 --> 00:40:39.967
an alcohol. 

00:40:39.967 --> 00:40:41.467
Like H, O, CH2, CH3. 

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.900
So we can have the unshared
pair-- 

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.267
and I'll do it in red again-- 

00:40:55.467 --> 00:40:56.733
attack the chromium. 

00:40:59.733 --> 00:41:16.000
So we've got H, O, Cr=O, double
bond O, O minus, or OH. 

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.233
Let's do the OH. 

00:41:24.033 --> 00:41:26.200
And now notice that we're in the
same business 

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.033
we were with bromine. 

00:41:28.033 --> 00:41:30.833
We have now-- 

00:41:30.833 --> 00:41:34.867
let me write this out so that it
looks like the one over there. 

00:41:34.867 --> 00:41:36.867
H, H. 

00:41:36.867 --> 00:41:40.200
So now we could bring up some
base, 

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.500
take this H, this goes in here.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.933
And the chromium leaves with
that pair of electrons. 

00:41:46.933 --> 00:41:50.067
So again, just as before, we'll
have lost the proton. 

00:41:50.067 --> 00:41:52.167
It looks just like what happened
over there. 

00:41:52.167 --> 00:41:56.067
The chromium came in, shared the
pair of electrons, and 

00:41:56.067 --> 00:42:00.533
then left with them in the
elimination reaction. 

00:42:00.533 --> 00:42:01.233
Right? 

00:42:01.233 --> 00:42:04.933
So again, it's an oxidation. 

00:42:04.933 --> 00:42:07.600
And if we could look at the
chromium afterwards. 

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.833
It's Cr, O, O, O, OH. 

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.400
And what's-- am I right here? 

00:42:20.567 --> 00:42:21.800
Minus. 

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.667
So it's got one, two, three,
four, five that it's giving to 

00:42:30.667 --> 00:42:33.233
oxygen, but it gets an electron
back with the minus. 

00:42:33.233 --> 00:42:36.500
So this is +4. 

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.167
So chromium goes from +6 to +4
in the process of 

00:42:40.167 --> 00:42:42.133
doing this oxidation. 

00:42:45.733 --> 00:42:48.767
Now, there's a problem in doing

00:42:48.767 --> 00:42:51.667
this to make an aldehyde. 

00:42:51.667 --> 00:42:58.367
And the problem is, when you're
working in water, if 

00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:00.400
the product you're going to get
here from this 

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.233
elimination-- 

00:43:01.233 --> 00:43:04.733
you've lost this proton, you
lose this H, break this bond, 

00:43:04.733 --> 00:43:06.133
so you have C=O. 

00:43:10.167 --> 00:43:14.500
Now, if that's what you want to
make, there's a problem. 

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.233
Because aldehydes, you know,
have an equilibrium constant 

00:43:17.233 --> 00:43:19.767
about one with water. 

00:43:19.767 --> 00:43:22.600
So this is going to add water to
make a diol. 

00:43:28.133 --> 00:43:29.367
And why is that a problem? 

00:43:32.267 --> 00:43:36.133
Because alcohols react with
chromium 

00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:38.433
trioxide to get oxidized. 

00:43:38.433 --> 00:43:44.367
So you could lose this. 

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.267
So this oxygen can give up its
pair of 

00:43:51.267 --> 00:43:52.667
electrons, get oxidized. 

00:43:52.667 --> 00:43:58.000
You lose this H and this H. And
then you would have OH, 

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:09.033
C=O. So you overoxidize all the
way to the 

00:44:09.033 --> 00:44:10.267
carboxylic acid. 

00:44:10.267 --> 00:44:13.533
We go on another step up there.

00:44:13.533 --> 00:44:16.867
Now, how can you avoid that
problem? 

00:44:16.867 --> 00:44:18.367
Let me get this back down. 

00:44:31.233 --> 00:44:34.567
You could do it by making this,
the reagent shown here. 

00:44:39.433 --> 00:44:42.267
Pyridinium chlorochromate. 

00:44:42.267 --> 00:44:47.167
So notice, you added HCl to
CrO3, which made 

00:44:47.167 --> 00:44:49.200
chlorochromic acid. 

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.700
And then the proton is given to
pyridine to make a 

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:54.733
pyridinium cation. 

00:44:54.733 --> 00:44:58.967
Now, that is organic enough that
it's readily soluble in 

00:44:58.967 --> 00:45:03.333
organic solvents, which the
other forms of chromium that 

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:05.100
we talked about are not. 

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:11.133
Now, can you see what advantage
that might provide, 

00:45:11.133 --> 00:45:17.700
to do it in an organic solvent
rather than in water? 

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.267
So the reagent is called
pyridinium chlorochromate. 

00:45:21.267 --> 00:45:25.867
And here's an example where you
get a 92% yield of the 

00:45:25.867 --> 00:45:30.667
aldehyde from a straight chain
alcohol using pyridinium 

00:45:30.667 --> 00:45:32.033
chlorochromate. 

00:45:32.033 --> 00:45:34.733
The crucial thing is the solvent
is 

00:45:34.733 --> 00:45:37.833
methylene chloride, CH2, Cl2. 

00:45:37.833 --> 00:45:38.667
Right? 

00:45:38.667 --> 00:45:44.433
No water, no gem-diol, and
therefore, no overoxidation. 

00:45:44.433 --> 00:45:50.467
Because the mechanism requires
the alcohol to react with. 

00:45:50.467 --> 00:45:54.167
I took that example from
Lauden's textbook. 

00:45:54.167 --> 00:45:58.167
However, so textbooks often-- 

00:45:58.167 --> 00:46:00.433
I have no doubt that that
happened, and that 

00:46:00.433 --> 00:46:02.200
they got 92% yield. 

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.367
But as a general reaction, there
can be a problem. 

00:46:04.367 --> 00:46:07.400
If you look at what Wikipedia
says about this, there seems 

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.200
to be the voice of experience
writing. 

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.267
It says, "In practice, the
chromium byproduct deposits 

00:46:13.267 --> 00:46:16.433
with pyridine as a sticky black
tar, which can 

00:46:16.433 --> 00:46:17.867
complicate matters." 

00:46:17.867 --> 00:46:22.100
You've gotten a rose-colored
picture in your lab. 

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.100
I mean, you've often had
frustrations, I know. 

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:28.133
But those reactions are
carefully chosen so you don't 

00:46:28.133 --> 00:46:29.933
get sticky black tars. 

00:46:29.933 --> 00:46:33.333
But you find very often, when
you try to do something in 

00:46:33.333 --> 00:46:35.367
organic chemistry, you get
something that's very 

00:46:35.367 --> 00:46:37.400
difficult to filter or deal
with. 

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.467
And that can happen in this
reaction. 

00:46:39.467 --> 00:46:42.467
But anyhow, pyridinium
chlorochromate is what you use 

00:46:42.467 --> 00:46:45.700
on an exam when it's asked, How
are you going to oxidize 

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.467
an alcohol to an aldehyde
without getting 

00:46:48.467 --> 00:46:51.267
a carboxylic acid? 

00:46:51.267 --> 00:46:53.133
Now, you can have-- 

00:46:53.133 --> 00:46:54.267
Oh, sorry. 

00:46:54.267 --> 00:46:56.167
We're going to have to carry on
with this next time. 

00:46:56.167 --> 00:46:57.400
Thanks.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.261
Prof: This morning we're
going to do something a little

00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:06.284
bit different,
which is I thought that

00:00:06.284 --> 00:00:08.140
everyone was ready for a break.
 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.280
So, we're going to have a guest
lecturer this morning.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.268
I thought it was particularly
important that at some point we

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:21.090
give you a perspective from the
clinical point of view,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.810
and so I'm introducing to you
Dr. Margaret Craven,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.040
and I'll just say a couple of
things about her.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.260
She's an OB/GYN,
and so for about thirty years

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.170
she was involved in the trenches
in the war against HIV/AIDS.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.020
And she's going to talk to us
this morning about HIV/AIDS in

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.980
this country,
as I said last time.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.740
And that's about all I wanted
to say;

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.941
except one other detail,
which is that she's also my

00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:55.930
wife.
 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.107
Dr. Margaret Craven:
 AIDS is fundamentally

00:00:58.107 --> 00:01:00.240
different than any other
emerging global pandemic

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.868
preceding it,
because of the high velocity of

00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:07.308
its spread around the world,
and of the race to understand

00:01:07.308 --> 00:01:08.828
and control it.
 

00:01:08.828 --> 00:01:13.533
I have given you a handout,
which is a copy of the 1981

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:16.405
MMWR,
which stands for Morbidity and

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:20.385
Mortality Weekly Report,
of the Centers for Disease

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:22.000
Control in Atlanta.
 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.468
The CDC was founded in 1946 to
control malaria,

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:29.388
and is now part of the
Department of Health and Human

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:30.370
Services.
 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.214
The MMWR is their fast-track
method of publishing a medical

00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:36.050
article.
 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.825
This is basically so that
clinicians can be up to speed on

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:41.580
things.
 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.372
One report is from Los Angeles
about cases of pneumocystis

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.390
pneumonias in gay men.
 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.391
In the same issue there was
also a report from New York City

00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:56.260
about a rare cancer called
Kaposi's sarcoma in gay men.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.913
Imagine that you're working in
the field of public health and

00:01:59.913 --> 00:02:01.069
are reading this.
 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.929
The front page describes five
cases of men between the ages of

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.240
twenty-nine and thirty-six.
 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.162
All of them are gay and all
have a rare lung infection

00:02:12.162 --> 00:02:14.530
called pneumocystis pneumonia.
 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.581
The back page of the report has
an editorial note explaining

00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:22.360
what it is, as it is so rare
that nobody would ever have

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.460
heard of it.
 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.385
The article was the starting
gun for a sprint on the part of

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:30.389
the medical community.
 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:34.250
Within three years of this
publication by the CDC,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.533
the human immunodeficiency
virus was identified as the

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:43.413
cause of AIDS,
the emerging epidemic of our

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:43.960
times.
 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.962
It is even more fragile,
fastidious and miniscule than

00:02:47.962 --> 00:02:51.590
the bacteria that cause syphilis
or gonorrhea.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.952
But it is spread the same way,
through the intimate exchange

00:02:56.952 --> 00:02:58.680
of bodily fluids.
 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.704
How did HIV become such a
powerful and widespread killer

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:06.912
in such a short time,
causing the present worldwide

00:03:06.912 --> 00:03:11.310
pandemic of around 33 million
infected individuals?

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.020
How has it left more than 25
million of us dead,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.530
and 14 million children
orphaned?

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.364
Why did it still infect about
2.7 million of us in the year

00:03:25.364 --> 00:03:29.788
2007, and kill 2 million people
that year?

00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:35.187
Certain historical background
conditions made this tragedy

00:03:35.187 --> 00:03:40.206
possible: globalization;
invasive medical technology,

00:03:40.206 --> 00:03:47.661
especially blood transfusions;
and migration and concentration

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:49.449
of gay men.
 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.318
Globalization is a phenomenon
that's been gathering momentum

00:03:53.318 --> 00:03:57.318
ever since Christopher Columbus
linked the two hemispheres.

00:03:57.318 --> 00:04:00.669
I think you've heard about the
Columbian Exchange.

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.870
Many thinkers have written
about it.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.746
I quote one of them:
"The need of a constantly

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.562
expanding market for its
products chases the bourgeoisie

00:04:10.562 --> 00:04:12.560
over the whole surface of the
globe.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.762
It must nestle everywhere,
settle everywhere,

00:04:15.762 --> 00:04:18.310
establish connections
everywhere.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.175
The bourgeoisie has,
through its exploitation of the

00:04:21.175 --> 00:04:23.593
world market,
given a cosmopolitan character

00:04:23.593 --> 00:04:26.459
to production and consumption in
every country.

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:28.439
To the great chagrin of
reactionists,

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.386
it has drawn from under the
feet of industry the national

00:04:31.386 --> 00:04:34.341
ground on which it stood,
while old, established national

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:38.170
industries have been destroyed,
or are daily being destroyed.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.182
They are dislodged by new
industries, whose introduction

00:04:41.182 --> 00:04:43.922
becomes a life and death
question for all civilized

00:04:43.922 --> 00:04:46.504
nations;
by industries that no longer

00:04:46.504 --> 00:04:50.839
work up indigenous raw material,
but raw material drawn from the

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:52.490
remotest zones."
 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.245
You may have recently heard
about the tanker on the

00:04:56.245 --> 00:04:59.399
Australian Reef that was going
to China.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:02.877
"Industries whose products
are consumed not only at home,

00:05:02.877 --> 00:05:04.930
but in every quarter of the
globe.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.478
In place of the old wants
satisfied by the productions of

00:05:08.478 --> 00:05:10.644
the country,
we find new wants,

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.819
requiring for their
satisfaction the products of

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.709
distant lands and climes.
 

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:18.920
In place of the old local and
national seclusion and

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.574
self-sufficiency,
we have intercourse in every

00:05:22.574 --> 00:05:28.464
direction,
universal interdependence of

00:05:28.464 --> 00:05:31.069
nations."
 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.569
Who do you think wrote this?
 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.565
Could it be Tom Friedman,
who frequently contributes to

00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:41.341
the New York Times and
writes extensively on

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.339
globalization?
 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:46.303
How about Adam Smith or Karl
Marx, both very famous political

00:05:46.303 --> 00:05:48.550
economists of earlier centuries?
 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.293
Or is it Jos� Bov�,
a French farmer who organized a

00:05:53.293 --> 00:05:58.300
peaceful removal of McDonald's
from his town in France?

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.850
I quote once more.
 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.791
"The bourgeoisie,
during its rule of scarce

00:06:02.791 --> 00:06:05.216
one-hundred years,
has created more massive and

00:06:05.216 --> 00:06:08.221
more colossal productive forces
than have all preceding

00:06:08.221 --> 00:06:11.002
generations together:
subjection of nature's forces

00:06:11.002 --> 00:06:13.968
to man and machinery;
application of chemistry to

00:06:13.968 --> 00:06:16.990
industry and agriculture;
steam navigation;

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.990
railways;
electric telegraphs;

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.029
clearing of whole continents
for cultivation;

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:26.985
canalization of rivers;
whole populations conjured out

00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:28.430
of the ground.
 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.444
What earlier century had even a
presentment that such productive

00:06:32.444 --> 00:06:35.440
forces slumbered in the lack of
social labor?

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.084
Modern bourgeois society,
with its relations of

00:06:38.084 --> 00:06:40.500
production, of exchange and of
property;

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.709
a society that has conjured up
such gigantic means of

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:47.168
production and of exchange is
like the sorcerer who is no

00:06:47.168 --> 00:06:50.750
longer able to control the
powers of the netherworld,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:57.339
whom he has called up by his
spells."

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:59.199
It sounds like this prophet,
Karl Marx,

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.910
speaking from the
mid-nineteenth century,

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.552
would not have been surprised
to learn that an even faster

00:07:03.552 --> 00:07:07.120
mode of transportation,
air travel, has been invented.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.370
It now links all the continents
of the globe,

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.730
so that we can wake up in
Africa and go to bed in Canada.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.410
This enabled one good-looking
French Canadian,

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.709
gay and very promiscuous
airline steward,

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:27.480
so-called Patient Zero,
to be instrumental in spreading

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.290
the AIDS epidemic throughout
North America.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.377
These same forces also gave
birth to a growing science and

00:07:36.377 --> 00:07:39.891
technology that formed the
underpinnings of modern

00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:43.120
biomedical research and Western
medicine.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.213
Let's reminisce about the
good-old days in the 1970s,

00:07:47.213 --> 00:07:48.079
pre-AIDS.
 

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:52.004
I was an OB/GYN resident and
remember that the medical

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:55.190
profession was full of optimism
and hope.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.851
A positive, rather complacent
attitude was instilled in us

00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:02.189
medical students about what
hardworking, well-trained

00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:04.759
doctors would be able to
accomplish.

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:08.387
We would be able to fix the
body's mechanical defects with

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:11.379
needles, tubes,
surgeries and blood products.

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:14.697
Syphilis, TB,
cholera and the other bacteria

00:08:14.697 --> 00:08:18.399
diseases would be eliminated
with antibiotics.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:23.202
Vaccinations could cure a long
list of awful diseases,

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:26.103
like smallpox,
polio, diphtheria,

00:08:26.103 --> 00:08:28.550
tetanus, and on and on.
 

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.426
Globalization of medicine in
the World Health Organization

00:08:32.426 --> 00:08:36.575
would make eradication of these
diseases from the entire globe

00:08:36.575 --> 00:08:37.460
possible.
 

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.666
Here's the World Health
Organization's optimistic

00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:47.330
definition of health,
back in those days.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.446
Ambitious scientists and
doctors were busy competing for

00:08:51.446 --> 00:08:54.815
grants, positions at prestigious
laboratories,

00:08:54.815 --> 00:08:57.509
and prizes like the Nobel
Prize.

00:08:57.509 --> 00:09:01.850
The Surgeon General of the
United States announced rather

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.571
arrogantly in 1976:
"We have turned the page

00:09:05.571 --> 00:09:08.129
on infectious diseases."
 

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:12.326
This smug medical attitude
suddenly disappeared in the

00:09:12.326 --> 00:09:16.918
1980s, when our community was
confronted with a totally new

00:09:16.918 --> 00:09:19.850
and mysterious emerging
pandemic.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.419
Where did it come from?
 

00:09:21.419 --> 00:09:23.639
How did it start?
 

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:27.722
I highly recommend to you a
book named The River,

00:09:27.722 --> 00:09:30.618
written by an Englishman,
Edward Hooper,

00:09:30.618 --> 00:09:33.960
who tries to answer these very
questions.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.875
The author's avowed role model
is Dr. John Snow,

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:39.110
the first modern
epidemiologist.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.990
He wrote a book about tracking
down the source of cholera

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.149
through the London water supply
in 1849;

00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:47.460
you probably covered that in
the course.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.355
Like Snow, Hooper has done an
exhaustive investigation of

00:09:51.355 --> 00:09:54.833
every available source of
knowledge relating to the

00:09:54.833 --> 00:09:57.269
emergence of the AIDS epidemic.
 

00:09:57.269 --> 00:10:01.312
Instead of one city,
however, he has had to trace

00:10:01.312 --> 00:10:04.259
the epidemic to three
continents.

00:10:04.259 --> 00:10:06.399
His story starts in the United
States,

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:09.905
with the first reported cases
from the CDC that you have

00:10:09.905 --> 00:10:12.028
there,
and traces the chain of

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.980
infection backwards in time.
 

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.173
Hooper agrees with Randy
Shilts, who wrote the AIDS

00:10:18.173 --> 00:10:21.528
classic And the Band Played
On.

00:10:21.528 --> 00:10:27.501
Both think that the beginning
of the epidemic here was

00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:30.769
probably July 4^(th),
1976.

00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:33.450
To celebrate the bicentennial
of our nation,

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.820
New York City hosted the Tall
Ships.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.009
Huge sailing ships came from
all over the world,

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:42.605
and there was a lot of
international partying going on

00:10:42.605 --> 00:10:44.029
in the Big Apple.
 

00:10:44.029 --> 00:10:47.009
Retrospectively,
studies revealed that the first

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:50.368
American babies who were
HIV-positive were born in New

00:10:50.368 --> 00:10:55.500
York City a year later;
1977.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.570
Hooper's story then moves to
Haiti.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.761
The refugees seeking asylum
here seemed to have a

00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:05.288
horrifyingly high incidence of
HIV,

00:11:05.288 --> 00:11:08.826
and as a result many Americans
went through a phase of

00:11:08.826 --> 00:11:12.428
scapegoating Haitian refugees as
the source of AIDS.

00:11:12.428 --> 00:11:16.428
"Papa Doc"
had a brutal regime that ruled

00:11:16.428 --> 00:11:20.577
Haiti from 1957 to 1971,
by means of violent death

00:11:20.577 --> 00:11:23.360
squads called the Tonton
Macoutes.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.529
Therefore, when the Belgium
Congo in Africa became

00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:28.860
independent from Belgium in
1960,

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:33.763
thousands of French-speaking
professionals escaped their

00:11:33.763 --> 00:11:38.399
oppressive government by taking
jobs in the Congo.

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.860
In addition,
to help solve his economic

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.585
problems in Haiti,
"Papa Doc"

00:11:43.585 --> 00:11:47.339
promoted his capital as a
tourist attraction for gay men

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:49.658
from North America and Germany.
 

00:11:49.658 --> 00:11:55.053
Haiti was not the only country
linking the chain of infection

00:11:55.053 --> 00:11:58.740
back to the Belgium colonies in
Africa.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.811
The epicenter of the disease is
found where Congo,

00:12:02.811 --> 00:12:07.048
Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda come
together by standard

00:12:07.048 --> 00:12:09.788
epidemiologic detective work.
 

00:12:09.788 --> 00:12:16.019
This is a picture of a refugee
camp that is right in that area

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:18.470
where AIDS originated.
 

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.649
How it started is a much more
controversial issue.

00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:24.674
Hooper finds extremely
compelling the hypothesis that

00:12:24.674 --> 00:12:27.798
an oral polio vaccine,
tested in Africa in 1958,

00:12:27.798 --> 00:12:31.870
in the very place that is now
the epicenter of the disease,

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:36.284
may have enabled the simian
immunosuppressive virus to cross

00:12:36.284 --> 00:12:38.678
species from chimps to humans.
 

00:12:38.678 --> 00:12:43.149
This hypothesis is one among
several about how the simian

00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:47.538
immune virus could have mutated
into a human disease.

00:12:47.538 --> 00:12:51.133
Of course, there's no ethical
way of proving any of them,

00:12:51.133 --> 00:12:54.149
so we will never actually know
what happened.

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:57.288
Anyhow, back to what we know
for sure.

00:12:57.288 --> 00:13:00.784
Another background condition
responsible for the rapid spread

00:13:00.784 --> 00:13:03.581
of AIDS are the tools of modern
western medicine:

00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:07.480
hypodermic needles,
blood banking and invasive

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.500
surgical techniques.
 

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.513
One of the first cases of
recognized AIDS occurred in a

00:13:13.513 --> 00:13:17.673
Danish surgeon named Grethe
Rask, who had gone to work in

00:13:17.673 --> 00:13:19.308
the Congo in 1964.
 

00:13:19.308 --> 00:13:23.304
She worked for three years in a
rural hospital that often had no

00:13:23.304 --> 00:13:26.350
surgical gloves,
doing her surgery barehanded.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.169
She fell ill in 1976,
eventually having to fly back

00:13:30.169 --> 00:13:34.371
to Denmark under emergency
conditions, and died there in

00:13:34.371 --> 00:13:35.058
1977.
 

00:13:35.058 --> 00:13:39.397
As we saw from the CDC Report,
the pneumocystis pneumonia that

00:13:39.397 --> 00:13:43.735
she had was a rare opportunistic
infection that only occurs in

00:13:43.735 --> 00:13:47.860
people with severe compromise of
their immune systems.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.369
According to close friends,
she had no other possible route

00:13:51.369 --> 00:13:53.788
of infection than performing
surgery,

00:13:53.788 --> 00:13:57.900
because she was celibate and
basically spent her whole life

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.610
working.
 

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:02.519
Hemophiliacs also were one of
the first groups noted to have

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:05.370
this new disease,
because they needed to use

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.220
pooled factor VIII to prevent
bleeding.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.461
At that time,
factor VIII was used from

00:14:10.461 --> 00:14:14.120
concentrated pooled serum from
many units of donated blood,

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:20.950
and by 1984 fifty percent of
hemophiliacs were HIV-positive.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.605
And of course the tools of
medicine don't stay locked in

00:14:24.605 --> 00:14:26.200
offices and hospitals.
 

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.274
Needles made their way onto the
street for shooting the heroin

00:14:30.274 --> 00:14:33.279
that globalized Mafia was making
available.

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:38.135
IV drug use also preceded the
arrival of HIV in New York at

00:14:38.135 --> 00:14:41.570
the Fourth of July celebration
in 1976.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.761
IVDUs--that stands for
intravenous drug users-- soon

00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:49.298
became one of the high-risk
groups for AIDS,

00:14:49.298 --> 00:14:51.600
along with hemophiliacs.
 

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.830
Let's take off that ugly
picture.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.567
The fourth factor in the rapid
spread of the epidemic was the

00:14:58.567 --> 00:15:02.429
migration and concentration of
gay men in certain locations.

00:15:02.429 --> 00:15:04.820
How and why did this happen?
 

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.070
Let's go back in time to the
middle of the twentieth century.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.235
The Nazi regime in Germany
revealed to the world how

00:15:11.235 --> 00:15:12.802
bigotry,
intolerance,

00:15:12.802 --> 00:15:17.000
racism and super-nationalism
can grow into a grotesque,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.289
violent, terrifying political
machine of ostracism,

00:15:20.289 --> 00:15:23.480
slavery and extermination.
 

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.440
In Hitler's Germany,
homosexuals were forced to wear

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.528
a pink triangle on their
clothes,

00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:30.298
and were sent to concentration
camps,

00:15:30.298 --> 00:15:33.985
along with Jews,
Communists, disabled people and

00:15:33.985 --> 00:15:34.769
gypsies.
 

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:38.395
I'm sorry to say that the Nazis
are not the first and last

00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:42.149
people in the world to be
bigoted, intolerant and racist.

00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:45.668
When American fighting men came
back home from World War II,

00:15:45.668 --> 00:15:47.879
blacks went back to the
segregated South,

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:51.519
Jews were excluded from social
clubs,

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:56.245
and not long afterward Senator
Joe McCarthy and FBI Director

00:15:56.245 --> 00:16:00.649
J.***Edgar Hoover took on
Communists and homosexuals.

00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:04.740
The police in many large cities
entrapped men in bathrooms by

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.283
propositioning them and
immediately arresting them if

00:16:08.283 --> 00:16:09.580
they responded.
 

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.657
The usual punishment was not
jail, but notification of the

00:16:13.657 --> 00:16:16.090
employer and public humiliation.
 

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:20.316
Alan Turing,
a mathematical genius who had

00:16:20.316 --> 00:16:24.129
cracked the Nazi's submarine
code,

00:16:24.129 --> 00:16:27.041
was arrested,
tried and convicted under

00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:30.490
Britain's Anti-Homosexual
Statutes in 1952.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:35.241
He committed suicide in the
summer of 1954 by taking a bite

00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:38.928
of a cyanide-laced apple in his
laboratory.

00:16:38.928 --> 00:16:42.240
What do people do when they're
living a life of harassment and

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.000
persecution?
 

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.966
They look for a place to go
where they'll be accepted,

00:16:45.966 --> 00:16:47.480
cared for and left alone.
 

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.870
Thus ghettos form,
even without state decree.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.571
After the war,
people who were ostracized and

00:16:54.571 --> 00:16:58.378
harassed back in their hometowns
began to seek the anonymity of

00:16:58.378 --> 00:16:59.298
big cities.
 

00:16:59.298 --> 00:17:02.778
A gay community sprang up in
Greenwich Village in New York.

00:17:02.778 --> 00:17:06.650
Another developed as a summer
vacation spot on Fire Island.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:11.497
In the '60s,
it was illegal to serve openly

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:13.690
gay men at a bar.
 

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.756
Radical gay power and
liberation was launched with the

00:17:16.756 --> 00:17:21.169
Stonewall Inn Riot,
the last weekend of June 1969,

00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:27.342
when a gay bar was raided by
the NYPD and drag queens fought

00:17:27.342 --> 00:17:28.180
back.
 

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.730
However, the apogee of
political success for gays was

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:36.930
achieved not in New York but in
San Francisco.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:41.148
Harvey Milk was elected as a
supervisor, the first openly gay

00:17:41.148 --> 00:17:43.470
elected official in the nation.
 

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:46.506
And some of you may have seen
the recent movie,

00:17:46.506 --> 00:17:50.068
the film that was named
Milk, which is about his

00:17:50.068 --> 00:17:50.730
story.
 

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.269
In 1978, right in City Hall,
Harvey Milk and the liberal

00:17:54.269 --> 00:17:55.954
mayor,
George Moscone,

00:17:55.954 --> 00:18:00.230
were shot by another member of
the Board of Supervisors,

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:05.278
the anti-gay politician Dan
White.

00:18:05.278 --> 00:18:09.615
Instantly, Harvey Milk became a
martyr, galvanizing gay

00:18:09.615 --> 00:18:10.660
solidarity.
 

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:15.098
By 1980, the then governor of
California, Edmund Brown,

00:18:15.098 --> 00:18:19.210
declared the last week in June
Gay Freedom Week.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:23.115
This is the week of Gay Freedom
Day parades all over the world,

00:18:23.115 --> 00:18:25.318
commemorating the Stonewall
Riot.

00:18:25.318 --> 00:18:27.830
As a result,
San Francisco became a Mecca

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.160
for gay people who streamed
there in great numbers.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.769
I quote Randy Shilts in And
the Band Played On:

00:18:34.769 --> 00:18:37.737
"The promise of freedom
had fueled the greatest exodus

00:18:37.737 --> 00:18:40.450
of immigrants to San Francisco
since the Gold Rush.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:45.567
Between 1969 and 1973,
at least 9,000 gay men moved to

00:18:45.567 --> 00:18:49.913
San Francisco,
followed by 20,000 between 1974

00:18:49.913 --> 00:18:51.170
and 1978.
 

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:55.769
By 1980, about 5,000 homosexual
men were moving to the Golden

00:18:55.769 --> 00:18:57.150
Gate every year.
 

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.244
The immigration now made for a
city in which two in five adult

00:19:01.244 --> 00:19:03.259
males were openly gay."
 

00:19:03.259 --> 00:19:10.200
This group was very politically
coherent.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.913
They were thrilled to come out
of the closet and participate

00:19:13.913 --> 00:19:14.480
openly.
 

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.720
Gay people started their own
churches and choirs.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.617
As a result,
local charities,

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:22.736
like the Red Cross,
were happy to exploit their

00:19:22.736 --> 00:19:24.160
civic mindedness.
 

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.904
In 1980, five to seven percent
of the donated blood in San

00:19:28.904 --> 00:19:33.983
Francisco was given by gay men
who did not know that they were

00:19:33.983 --> 00:19:35.400
HIV-positive.
 

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.318
Of course, immigrant groups
always have their seamier side

00:19:39.318 --> 00:19:42.068
of organized crime and
commercial sex.

00:19:42.068 --> 00:19:45.167
Gay men, in particular,
were accustomed to covert and

00:19:45.167 --> 00:19:47.730
anonymous expression of their
sexuality,

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.806
and participation in the
bathhouse culture was more

00:19:50.806 --> 00:19:52.160
mainstream for them.
 

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.007
Remember, many of these young
men had been repressing and

00:19:55.007 --> 00:19:57.548
hiding their sexuality for most
of their lives,

00:19:57.548 --> 00:20:02.336
and when society denies people
healthy ways of expressing their

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:05.609
sexuality,
all kinds of strange things

00:20:05.609 --> 00:20:07.038
begin to happen.
 

00:20:07.038 --> 00:20:10.095
Many of the strange things that
happened in the bathhouses are

00:20:10.095 --> 00:20:13.000
perfect methods of transmitting
every kind of infection;

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.211
especially Hepatitis B,
giardia, salmonella,

00:20:17.211 --> 00:20:20.250
and something brand new,
HIV.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.477
And if you don't know what the
bathhouses are,

00:20:23.477 --> 00:20:28.210
I would recommend that you read
Randy Shilt's book and find out.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:32.041
So, this is the background of
AIDS: globalization,

00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:36.185
modern invasive medical
technology, and ghettoizing of

00:20:36.185 --> 00:20:37.358
gay people.
 

00:20:37.358 --> 00:20:41.936
Okay, let's return to 1981 and
the first report in the medical

00:20:41.936 --> 00:20:45.390
literature, that you all have in
your hands.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.328
Western doctors who read it
were oblivious to the fact that

00:20:49.328 --> 00:20:53.471
while everyone was celebrating
the World Health Organization's

00:20:53.471 --> 00:20:57.140
successful program to eradicate
smallpox in 1978,

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.808
a stealthy brand new germ had
spread from Central Africa,

00:21:00.808 --> 00:21:02.869
via professionals who had
worked there,

00:21:02.869 --> 00:21:04.808
to both Haiti and Europe.
 

00:21:04.808 --> 00:21:08.182
It had been introduced to
centers of commercialized gay

00:21:08.182 --> 00:21:10.166
sex,
once it had spread into the

00:21:10.166 --> 00:21:12.690
blood banks and hospitals of
every nation,

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:17.358
into intravenous drug users and
into their partners and babies.

00:21:17.358 --> 00:21:20.227
Of course, when the first
horrible deaths from weird

00:21:20.227 --> 00:21:23.318
infections occurred in the late
'70s and early '80s,

00:21:23.318 --> 00:21:26.637
doctors had no idea that the
cause of this mysterious

00:21:26.637 --> 00:21:29.509
immunological deficiency was a
retrovirus,

00:21:29.509 --> 00:21:34.505
that it was a slow virus and
had been contracted up to ten

00:21:34.505 --> 00:21:35.818
years before.
 

00:21:35.818 --> 00:21:39.965
The first characteristic of the
disease observant doctors

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.779
noticed was its typical STD
pattern.

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:47.088
It affected exactly the same
high-risk groups that syphilis

00:21:47.088 --> 00:21:49.690
and Hepatitis B affect:
gay men,

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.710
prostitutes of both sexes,
intravenous drug users,

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.019
and hemophiliacs.
 

00:21:55.019 --> 00:21:58.666
This epidemiological pattern
caused instant recognition in

00:21:58.666 --> 00:22:00.778
the minds of the knowledgeable.
 

00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:04.526
They immediately knew that this
was an infectious disease caused

00:22:04.526 --> 00:22:06.368
by a virus and bodily fluids.
 

00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:11.351
That's why the first reports
submitted in 1981 were published

00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:13.509
immediately in the MMWR.
 

00:22:13.509 --> 00:22:15.288
Take another look at the paper
yourselves.

00:22:15.288 --> 00:22:18.511
Imagine reading it and
instantly predicting the awful

00:22:18.511 --> 00:22:19.068
future.
 

00:22:19.068 --> 00:22:22.118
Luckily for all of us,
Dr. Don Francis,

00:22:22.118 --> 00:22:25.490
the man in the sweater,
did just that.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:29.739
He was a thirty-eight-year-old
epidemiologist who was at the

00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:33.340
time working with the gay
community on developing a

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.068
Hepatitis B vaccine.
 

00:22:35.068 --> 00:22:35.748
His Ph.D.
 

00:22:35.748 --> 00:22:39.288
project and lab work had been
on retroviruses.

00:22:39.288 --> 00:22:41.088
On hearing about these two
reports,

00:22:41.088 --> 00:22:43.548
he instantly put two and two
together,

00:22:43.548 --> 00:22:46.265
to predict that this was a
virus responsible for

00:22:46.265 --> 00:22:49.269
immunosuppressant and to
predisposing to cancers,

00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:52.759
as well as opportunistic
infections.

00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:55.108
Why, just the year before,
in 1980,

00:22:55.108 --> 00:22:58.635
Dr. Robert Gallo of the
National Cancer Institute had

00:22:58.635 --> 00:23:02.297
shown that a retrovirus he
called HTLV caused a type of

00:23:02.297 --> 00:23:04.400
leukemia common in Japan.
 

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.318
It was contagious and had a
frighteningly long incubation

00:23:08.318 --> 00:23:08.950
period.
 

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.798
Dr. Francis at the CDC
understood immediately,

00:23:11.798 --> 00:23:14.798
in 1981, what sort of a
disaster was in the making,

00:23:14.798 --> 00:23:18.150
and so right away he began
trying to move heaven and earth,

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:23.992
to get money for research for
virus labs to isolate the virus

00:23:23.992 --> 00:23:26.720
and get a diagnostic test.
 

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.440
But his pleas fell mostly on
deaf ears.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.769
A few did eventually pay
attention to him,

00:23:32.769 --> 00:23:35.808
luckily, and a year later
Dr. Gallo,

00:23:35.808 --> 00:23:38.707
at the NCI was finally
convinced that Dr. Francis was

00:23:38.707 --> 00:23:41.413
right,
and dedicated a portion of his

00:23:41.413 --> 00:23:42.880
lab to the research.
 

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.385
Meanwhile in France,
Professor Luc Montagnier of the

00:23:46.385 --> 00:23:50.413
Pasteur Institute,
and in San Francisco Jay Levy,

00:23:50.413 --> 00:23:54.720
were also working on trying to
isolate the virus.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.941
The French isolated it first,
and soon afterwards applied to

00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:03.019
the Patent Office in the United
States for blood tests.

00:24:03.019 --> 00:24:06.279
Gallo's lab announced in 1884
that they had discovered the

00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:09.450
AIDS infectious agent,
applied also for a patent,

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.930
and tried to take all the
credit for the discovery.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.548
This led to an unpleasant and
embarrassing squabble between

00:24:16.548 --> 00:24:17.858
France and the U.S.
 

00:24:17.858 --> 00:24:23.509
We always seem to be getting
into little squabbles with them.

00:24:23.509 --> 00:24:27.028
Finally after lawsuits,
congressional investigations

00:24:27.028 --> 00:24:30.339
and public apologies,
everyone agreed on a way to

00:24:30.339 --> 00:24:31.028
share.
 

00:24:31.028 --> 00:24:35.499
A settlement negotiated in 1987
named Montagnier and Gallo as

00:24:35.499 --> 00:24:38.344
co-discoverers,
and divided the royalties from

00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:40.548
the blood test between an AIDS
foundation,

00:24:40.548 --> 00:24:44.380
the NIH and the Pasteur
Institute.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.432
The 2008 Nobel Prize in
Medicine went to

00:24:47.432 --> 00:24:50.328
Dr. Montagnier for his
discovery.

00:24:50.328 --> 00:24:54.941
As you can see,
it is he who is smiling,

00:24:54.941 --> 00:24:57.068
not Dr. Gallo.
 

00:24:57.068 --> 00:25:01.042
Montagnier's and Gallo's
efforts had produced a

00:25:01.042 --> 00:25:04.930
diagnostic, at least a blood
test, by 1984.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.650
This had enormous implications,
of course, for the blood

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:08.588
banking industry.
 

00:25:08.588 --> 00:25:12.703
It also meant that populations
could be screened to find out

00:25:12.703 --> 00:25:14.028
who was infected.
 

00:25:14.028 --> 00:25:17.476
Naturally, epidemiologists
wanted to screen the high-risk

00:25:17.476 --> 00:25:21.170
populations to find out the
actual extent of the epidemic.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.588
They wanted to do what
epidemiologists always do;

00:25:24.588 --> 00:25:28.393
try to contain the disaster by
identifying carriers and their

00:25:28.393 --> 00:25:32.068
contacts, and by preventing the
spread of the infection.

00:25:32.068 --> 00:25:34.196
Unfortunately,
they knew that trying to work

00:25:34.196 --> 00:25:38.121
with the two high-risk groups,
MSMs--that's men who have sex

00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:42.096
with men--
and IVDUs was not going to be

00:25:42.096 --> 00:25:42.740
easy.
 

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.058
As an example,
gay Ga�tan Dugas,

00:25:46.058 --> 00:25:50.000
the Canadian airline steward
who is known as Patient Zero,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.240
estimated he had approximately
250 sexual partners per year,

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.569
and carried on like that for
longer than ten years.

00:25:58.569 --> 00:26:00.900
Busy guy.
 

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.151
The hotline at the Kaposi's
Sarcoma Foundation began

00:26:05.151 --> 00:26:10.152
receiving repeated calls from
people who had had sex in a sex

00:26:10.152 --> 00:26:14.676
parlor with a Frenchman,
and he then calmly told them

00:26:14.676 --> 00:26:18.440
that he had gay cancer,
or Kaposi's sarcoma.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.269
This is Ga�tan Dugas.
 

00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:28.769
And this is what one of the
signs of Kaposi's sarcoma.

00:26:28.769 --> 00:26:31.096
As a result,
a director of the San Francisco

00:26:31.096 --> 00:26:34.507
Public Health Department had to
confront him of the consequences

00:26:34.507 --> 00:26:35.588
of his behavior.
 

00:26:35.588 --> 00:26:38.967
His pithy response to her was,
"It's none of your

00:26:38.967 --> 00:26:40.368
god-damned business.
 

00:26:40.368 --> 00:26:43.650
It's my right to do what I want
to do with my own body."

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:48.077
If I was totally cool,
I would say that with a French

00:26:48.077 --> 00:26:49.950
accent, but I'm not.
 

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:55.630
Next, the exact mechanisms of
pathogenesis were worked out.

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:59.698
HIV was shown to be transmitted
by sexual contract from exposure

00:26:59.698 --> 00:27:02.733
to infected blood,
or from an infected mother to

00:27:02.733 --> 00:27:06.920
her fetus or breastfed infant;
although the paranoid public

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.400
thought that you could get it
from doorknobs and toilet seats.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.934
Once the virus gained access to
the new host,

00:27:14.934 --> 00:27:19.755
it would target lymphocytes in
the blood with the CD4 surface

00:27:19.755 --> 00:27:20.798
molecule.
 

00:27:20.798 --> 00:27:24.125
After gaining entry to these
important cells in the immune

00:27:24.125 --> 00:27:26.497
system,
since the virus is cytopathic

00:27:26.497 --> 00:27:28.838
and cell killing it would
replicate,

00:27:28.838 --> 00:27:30.380
kill the cell,
and release into the

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.508
bloodstream,
causing a viremia of billions

00:27:33.508 --> 00:27:34.690
of particles.
 

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:39.569
Researchers discovered that
they could follow the course of

00:27:39.569 --> 00:27:42.598
the disease by counting CD4
cells.

00:27:42.598 --> 00:27:46.538
More recently,
the ability to measure viral

00:27:46.538 --> 00:27:50.568
loads directly has also become
possible,

00:27:50.568 --> 00:27:54.548
and so this is presently a
routine means of monitoring the

00:27:54.548 --> 00:27:57.690
course of disease and impactive
treatments.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:01.344
In healthy people,
CD4 counts are over 500 cells

00:28:01.344 --> 00:28:05.286
per millimeter cubed,
and when the count drops under

00:28:05.286 --> 00:28:09.298
200 the person experiences
significant immunodeficiency,

00:28:09.298 --> 00:28:12.990
so that their body cannot fight
off opportunistic infections

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:16.680
like TB,
pneumocystis pneumonia--or PCP

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.401
as it's called--
toxoplasmosis and cryptococcal

00:28:21.401 --> 00:28:22.608
meningitis.
 

00:28:22.608 --> 00:28:26.811
Here's a chart showing the most
common presenting complaints in

00:28:26.811 --> 00:28:30.269
a Haitian clinic,
leading to a diagnosis of AIDS.

00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:35.838
You can see that fifty-four
percent presented with TB.

00:28:35.838 --> 00:28:39.818
Sorry, yes, extra pulmonary and
pulmonary TB.

00:28:39.818 --> 00:28:44.038
Ten percent were diagnosed as
part of pregnancy screening.

00:28:44.038 --> 00:28:46.468
And the third largest group had
what was called "slim

00:28:46.468 --> 00:28:50.348
disease";
which is basically wasting away.

00:28:50.348 --> 00:28:54.940
Once the pathogenesis was
understood, strategies for

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.730
treatment could be developed.
 

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.808
This has consisted of three
prongs of attack:

00:29:00.808 --> 00:29:02.479
1,
Aggressive treatment and

00:29:02.479 --> 00:29:05.665
prevention of the opportunistic
infections that ravaged the

00:29:05.665 --> 00:29:07.808
bodies of immuno-compromised
people;

00:29:07.808 --> 00:29:11.528
2, antiretrovirals,
and more recently,

00:29:11.528 --> 00:29:13.740
protease inhibitors.
 

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:18.009
That's lots of pills.
 

00:29:18.009 --> 00:29:22.500
The invention of antiretroviral
agents began with AZT,

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.278
introduced in 1987.
 

00:29:24.278 --> 00:29:28.240
Since then, more than fourteen
have been approved by the FDA,

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.352
the Food and Drug
Administration,

00:29:30.352 --> 00:29:32.858
which is incredibly fast
approval.

00:29:32.858 --> 00:29:36.240
Usually the FDA is very slow
and deliberate about approving

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:36.940
new drugs.
 

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.194
However, because of intense
pressure from gay activists,

00:29:41.194 --> 00:29:44.521
like ACT UP,
the rules were changed for AIDS

00:29:44.521 --> 00:29:45.759
medications.
 

00:29:45.759 --> 00:29:49.930
In 1994, the Pediatric AIDS
Clinical Trial Group protocols

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.073
showed that AZT,
taken during pregnancy,

00:29:53.073 --> 00:29:57.496
could significantly reduce the
vertical transmission of HIV

00:29:57.496 --> 00:29:59.250
from mother to baby.
 

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:03.660
There's also firm evidence now
that drugs given after exposure,

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.256
for medical workers,
rape victims,

00:30:06.256 --> 00:30:10.616
or other unprotected sex,
offers a good hope of

00:30:10.616 --> 00:30:11.848
prevention.
 

00:30:11.848 --> 00:30:16.028
This is called post-exposure
prophylaxis.

00:30:16.028 --> 00:30:20.699
And the most recent discovery
is that circumcision offers some

00:30:20.699 --> 00:30:22.230
protection to men.
 

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:26.334
In the space of seven years,
from the first reported cases

00:30:26.334 --> 00:30:29.788
in 1981 of agonizing deaths in
young gay men,

00:30:29.788 --> 00:30:32.436
the scientific medical
establishment was able to

00:30:32.436 --> 00:30:35.759
unravel the mystery of the
disease and start treating it.

00:30:35.759 --> 00:30:37.779
However, because of
globalization,

00:30:37.779 --> 00:30:40.180
and because of cultural
attitudes towards sex--

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:44.118
that we'll talk about--HIV/AIDS
had already spread around the

00:30:44.118 --> 00:30:47.556
entire world,
within those seven years,

00:30:47.556 --> 00:30:51.279
and was decimating Sub-Saharan
Africa.

00:30:51.279 --> 00:30:54.959
Since 1987, tremendous strides
have been made in wealthy

00:30:54.959 --> 00:30:58.503
countries in treating the
disease with complicated and

00:30:58.503 --> 00:31:00.980
expensive multiple drug
regimens.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:07.413
Recommendations from a CDC
panel in 2002 state:

00:31:07.413 --> 00:31:13.710
"Antiretroviral regimens
are complex,

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.558
have serious side effects,
pose difficulty with adherence,

00:31:17.558 --> 00:31:20.211
and carry serious potential
consequences from the

00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:23.634
development of viral resistance
because of non-adherence to the

00:31:23.634 --> 00:31:26.953
drug regimen,
or suboptimal levels of

00:31:26.953 --> 00:31:29.278
antiretroviral agents.
 

00:31:29.278 --> 00:31:32.923
Haitian involvement in
therapeutic decisions is

00:31:32.923 --> 00:31:34.269
critical."
 

00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:37.529
It's a full-time job,
being HIV-positive,

00:31:37.529 --> 00:31:40.868
just keeping track of your
medications.

00:31:40.868 --> 00:31:44.563
These treatments cost well over
fifteen hundred dollars a month,

00:31:44.563 --> 00:31:46.848
and turn AIDS into a chronic
illness.

00:31:46.848 --> 00:31:49.143
Most of the people in the
world, however,

00:31:49.143 --> 00:31:52.296
are too poor to have access to
these expensive drugs and

00:31:52.296 --> 00:31:54.358
complex healthcare interactions.
 

00:31:54.358 --> 00:31:57.423
The majority of people with
AIDS waste away,

00:31:57.423 --> 00:32:01.344
and die, between the ages of
twenty-five and forty-four,

00:32:01.344 --> 00:32:04.480
without the benefit of any
medical care.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.778
Despite millions of dollars,
and years of trying,

00:32:07.778 --> 00:32:11.355
all attempts at developing a
vaccine have been dismal

00:32:11.355 --> 00:32:12.730
failures so far.
 

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.759
But this is basically an STD,
isn't it?

00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:19.490
What about prevention?
 

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.740
We all know that STDs are
potentially preventable.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.950
So, why wasn't something done
at the beginning of the

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:26.630
epidemic?
 

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.665
Why did the world wait around
for science to be worked out

00:32:29.665 --> 00:32:32.970
before going into action to do
something about the disaster?

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.537
You can bet that all smart
medical personnel,

00:32:36.537 --> 00:32:40.346
like this lovely nurse,
instantly put on gloves,

00:32:40.346 --> 00:32:43.589
gowns and masks,
and instituted universal

00:32:43.589 --> 00:32:48.394
precautions;
which is the modern day

00:32:48.394 --> 00:32:50.140
quarantine.
 

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:54.868
Why didn't everybody else put
on their condoms?

00:32:54.868 --> 00:32:58.340
Our culture greeted the news of
this frightening new disease

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.105
with the same old
counterproductive reactions of

00:33:01.105 --> 00:33:03.109
the past--
scapegoating,

00:33:03.109 --> 00:33:08.380
mass hysteria--and the public
was given a front row seat by

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:12.830
modern mass media to the
confrontation between the

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:16.691
Religious Right,
led by people like Reverend

00:33:16.691 --> 00:33:19.380
Jerry Falwell and his Moral
Majority,

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.558
and organized gays like ACT UP.
 

00:33:22.558 --> 00:33:26.598
It was even more exciting than
professional wrestling.

00:33:26.598 --> 00:33:29.921
When the media and the public
realized, however,

00:33:29.921 --> 00:33:34.019
that unsuspecting patients were
being infected by the blood

00:33:34.019 --> 00:33:37.200
supply, people with AIDS were
ostracized.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.940
Hemophiliac children were
prevented from attending school.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.480
Haitian immigrants were
excluded from the country.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.098
People were afraid to donate
blood.

00:33:48.098 --> 00:33:52.022
They associated walking into a
blood bank with catching the

00:33:52.022 --> 00:33:52.700
disease.
 

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:57.181
But when Rock Hudson,
a movie star icon of male

00:33:57.181 --> 00:34:01.382
charisma at the time,
announced he had AIDS,

00:34:01.382 --> 00:34:05.652
and died of it in 1985,
the American media and its

00:34:05.652 --> 00:34:10.538
adoring public finally decided
we'd better get serious about

00:34:10.538 --> 00:34:11.780
all of this.
 

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:17.909
Old religious ideas about
sexuality took on fresh meaning.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:21.467
Suddenly everyone began talking
about celibacy,

00:34:21.467 --> 00:34:23.480
monogamy and abstinence.
 

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.365
The sixties and seventies had
been a time of liberalization of

00:34:27.365 --> 00:34:30.170
old sexual mores in Western
civilizations.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:32.539
With the invention of the birth
control pill,

00:34:32.539 --> 00:34:36.260
legalized abortion and
effective treatments for STDs,

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:40.360
many religious fundamentalists
had been very unhappy.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.501
Now they could climb into their
pulpits and preach fire and

00:34:44.501 --> 00:34:45.360
brimstone.
 

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.755
Jerry Falwell,
a Baptist minister pronounced:

00:34:49.755 --> 00:34:55.650
"AIDS is not just God's
punishment for homosexuals,

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.521
it is God's punishment for the
society that tolerates

00:34:59.521 --> 00:35:01.010
homosexuals."
 

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:04.184
The Roman Catholic Church,
ruled by the Pope from the Holy

00:35:04.184 --> 00:35:06.690
See at the Vatican as an
absolute monarch,

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.918
made a response through its
Global Government of Bishops and

00:35:09.918 --> 00:35:10.849
Parish Priests.
 

00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:15.018
The Catholic Church also
condemned homosexuality.

00:35:15.018 --> 00:35:19.536
And since the Catholic Church
is opposed to all birth control,

00:35:19.536 --> 00:35:22.500
the use of condoms was also
condemned.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.152
Now, the gay community has a
particular interest in the

00:35:26.152 --> 00:35:27.369
Catholic Church.
 

00:35:27.369 --> 00:35:31.047
They suspect that many who have
taken a vow of celibacy may

00:35:31.047 --> 00:35:33.139
actually be closet homosexuals.
 

00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:36.530
As a result,
a decision was made by the gay

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:41.454
community to hold their annual
World Pride Celebration in Rome

00:35:41.454 --> 00:35:43.150
in the Year 2000.
 

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:47.393
This was especially maddening
because the late Pope John Paul

00:35:47.393 --> 00:35:51.284
II and the Vatican had mobilized
tremendous resources to

00:35:51.284 --> 00:35:54.539
celebrate the 2000 Years of
Christianity,

00:35:54.539 --> 00:35:56.469
the Jubilee.
 

00:35:56.469 --> 00:36:00.056
The church tried pressuring the
Italian government to remove its

00:36:00.056 --> 00:36:02.449
support for the Gay Pride
demonstration.

00:36:02.449 --> 00:36:05.266
The pope appeared to make the
following statement:

00:36:05.266 --> 00:36:07.739
"In the name of the Church
of Rome,

00:36:07.739 --> 00:36:12.157
I must express sadness for the
affront to the Grand Jubilee of

00:36:12.157 --> 00:36:14.737
the Year 2000,
and for the offense to the

00:36:14.737 --> 00:36:17.844
Christian values of the city
that is so dear to the hearts of

00:36:17.844 --> 00:36:19.400
the Catholics of the world.
 

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.329
Homosexual acts are against
Nature's laws.

00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:28.570
The church cannot silence the
truth, because this would not

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:33.268
help discern what is good from
what is evil."

00:36:33.268 --> 00:36:36.523
Before AIDS emerged in the
United States,

00:36:36.523 --> 00:36:41.324
right-wing religious groups had
organized politically around

00:36:41.324 --> 00:36:43.440
anti-abortion agendas.
 

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.690
This group, which uses the
buzzwords "right to

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.489
life" and "family
values,"

00:36:47.489 --> 00:36:50.521
was already up and running,
with big clout on the

00:36:50.521 --> 00:36:52.719
Republican Party's platform.
 

00:36:52.719 --> 00:36:58.335
They had helped to elect the
conservative California

00:36:58.335 --> 00:37:03.179
governor, President Ronald
Reagan in 1980.

00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:08.056
He was in the White House,
busy slashing the healthcare

00:37:08.056 --> 00:37:11.670
budget when the AIDS tragedy
unfolded.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:17.152
A disease of gay men and drug
users was not a priority for

00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:17.730
him.
 

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.822
At a time that called for
strong leadership to contain a

00:37:20.822 --> 00:37:24.019
major emerging epidemic,
our president chose to remain

00:37:24.019 --> 00:37:27.032
oblivious to the insistent
demands of the CDC and gay

00:37:27.032 --> 00:37:30.449
rights groups to be proactive
about preventing the spread of

00:37:30.449 --> 00:37:31.320
suffering.
 

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.219
In addition,
he had instituted the gag rule,

00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:39.268
which effectively defunded the
United Nations Population Fund,

00:37:39.268 --> 00:37:42.719
the largest backer in the world
of women's reproductive health,

00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:46.429
the clinics where poor people
get condoms.

00:37:46.429 --> 00:37:49.230
When President Reagan nominated
Dr. C.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:52.559
Everett Koop to be his surgeon
general,

00:37:52.559 --> 00:37:56.699
feminists, gays and pro-choice
groups were worried because this

00:37:56.699 --> 00:38:00.106
pediatric surgeon from
Philadelphia had a reputation

00:38:00.106 --> 00:38:02.110
for an anti-choice agenda.
 

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:06.215
Finally, five years into the
epidemic, President Reagan

00:38:06.215 --> 00:38:10.701
responded to mounting pressure
by asking Dr. Koop to prepare

00:38:10.701 --> 00:38:12.449
a report on AIDS.
 

00:38:12.449 --> 00:38:15.260
Dr.***Koop is a great guy.
 

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.264
He's a good,
hard-working doctor,

00:38:17.264 --> 00:38:21.027
and he got busy for the next
nine months doing a thorough and

00:38:21.027 --> 00:38:23.659
honest job investigating the
epidemic.

00:38:23.659 --> 00:38:27.510
He ended up writing a lot of
the report by himself.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:31.250
To the medical profession's
delight, the report was

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:35.289
explicit, non-judgmental,
controversial and popular.

00:38:35.289 --> 00:38:38.371
It contributed significantly to
providing accurate,

00:38:38.371 --> 00:38:40.960
comprehensive information to
the public.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.860
Koop also personally penned
"Understanding AIDS,"

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.309
the public health brochure.
 

00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:53.338
He made the decision to send
the brochure to all 107 million

00:38:53.338 --> 00:38:53.849
U.S.
 

00:38:53.849 --> 00:38:58.041
households in 1988,
the largest public health

00:38:58.041 --> 00:38:59.469
mailing ever.
 

00:38:59.469 --> 00:39:03.262
And rumor had it at the time
that President Reagan didn't

00:39:03.262 --> 00:39:06.851
find out about it until
after--after he got his in the

00:39:06.851 --> 00:39:08.070
mail, I guess.
 

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:12.081
Aside from Dr.***Koop, however,
the Reagan administration had

00:39:12.081 --> 00:39:15.612
two political agendas that could
not have been more inimical to

00:39:15.612 --> 00:39:17.150
containing the epidemic.
 

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:21.710
The statistics speak for
themselves.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:25.211
Instead of providing more
funding to the government's

00:39:25.211 --> 00:39:29.454
health agencies to deal with the
problem, the administration was

00:39:29.454 --> 00:39:30.869
slashing budgets.
 

00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:33.730
In addition,
they blocked efforts of sex

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.809
educators worldwide,
around STD prevention,

00:39:36.809 --> 00:39:38.789
the so-called gag rule.
 

00:39:38.789 --> 00:39:42.677
The large groups of people who
believe in preventive medicine

00:39:42.677 --> 00:39:47.018
began lobbying hard for good sex
education and PR for condom use.

00:39:47.018 --> 00:39:49.393
But Republicans and the
religious right have

00:39:49.393 --> 00:39:52.373
consistently tried to block
providing this education in

00:39:52.373 --> 00:39:55.827
public schools and on TV,
while legislating

00:39:55.827 --> 00:40:02.230
abstinence-only education,
to which billions of dollars

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.320
have been given.
 

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.697
The gay community,
of course, educated themselves

00:40:06.697 --> 00:40:09.467
about safer sex,
but they blocked the closing

00:40:09.467 --> 00:40:13.449
down of the bathhouses for an
unconscionable amount of time.

00:40:13.449 --> 00:40:17.489
Another preventive strategy
that can tremendously slow the

00:40:17.489 --> 00:40:20.610
spread of HIV is needle exchange
programs.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:25.809
IVDUs--intravenous drug
users--reuse dirty needles.

00:40:25.809 --> 00:40:28.697
In countries that provide
sterile needles in exchange for

00:40:28.697 --> 00:40:31.532
dirty ones, the spread of
disease among this group slows

00:40:31.532 --> 00:40:32.409
dramatically.
 

00:40:32.409 --> 00:40:37.635
However, in the United States,
these programs have been

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:40.829
blocked by the religious right.
 

00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:44.942
One of the most depressingly
shortsighted responses to the

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:48.550
epidemic was that of the blood
banking industry.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:50.864
The Food and Drug
Administration is the federal

00:40:50.864 --> 00:40:53.579
agency that regulates them,
but politics prevented them

00:40:53.579 --> 00:40:55.139
from doing the right thing.
 

00:40:55.139 --> 00:40:58.347
Dr. Don Francis and the CDC
were desperately trying to

00:40:58.347 --> 00:41:00.539
convince the FDA,
the Red Cross,

00:41:00.539 --> 00:41:03.119
the American Association of
Blood Banks,

00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:05.469
the National Hemophilia
Foundation,

00:41:05.469 --> 00:41:08.340
to institute screening of blood
for Hepatitis B,

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:13.739
even before the blood test for
HIV had been invented.

00:41:13.739 --> 00:41:17.402
Because gay men had cooperated
in the research for a vaccine

00:41:17.402 --> 00:41:20.360
against Hepatitis B,
it was clear to everyone that

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.474
the same people at risk for one
disease were at risk for the

00:41:23.474 --> 00:41:23.949
other.
 

00:41:23.949 --> 00:41:27.090
But the gay groups were
absolutely paranoid about

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.659
screening of any kind.
 

00:41:28.659 --> 00:41:34.208
They feared the stigma of
positive blood tests would

00:41:34.208 --> 00:41:37.726
affect their--
would make them lose their job

00:41:37.726 --> 00:41:40.932
and their insurance,
and the blood banking industry

00:41:40.932 --> 00:41:44.804
was very happy to go along with
the gay lobby because it would

00:41:44.804 --> 00:41:48.420
be so expensive and such a big
deal for them to screen the

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.119
blood.
 

00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:52.523
Therefore, even though Don
Francis was openly accusing them

00:41:52.523 --> 00:41:56.061
of negligent homicide,
the Red Cross did nothing until

00:41:56.061 --> 00:41:58.813
1985,
when the screening test for HIV

00:41:58.813 --> 00:42:00.139
became available.
 

00:42:00.139 --> 00:42:02.900
Prior to this,
babies needing transfusions,

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.159
grandmothers needing hip
replacements,

00:42:05.159 --> 00:42:07.016
hemophiliacs,
their wives,

00:42:07.016 --> 00:42:09.840
and many others had died
premature,

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.208
prolonged and painful deaths,
from the contaminated blood

00:42:14.208 --> 00:42:14.909
supply.
 

00:42:14.909 --> 00:42:17.929
Once blood testing became
routine,

00:42:17.929 --> 00:42:20.659
politically organized gay
groups successively got

00:42:20.659 --> 00:42:23.445
irrationally stringent
confidentiality laws passed

00:42:23.445 --> 00:42:27.469
around the screening test,
and those regulations have had

00:42:27.469 --> 00:42:32.289
a negative impact on collecting
accurate statistics ever since.

00:42:32.289 --> 00:42:36.362
Luckily, not all reactions to
the AIDS crisis were based on

00:42:36.362 --> 00:42:39.380
intolerance, political
expediency, financial

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.119
shortsightedness and
self-interest.

00:42:42.119 --> 00:42:44.869
Many nurses,
doctors, families and friends

00:42:44.869 --> 00:42:47.471
of victims,
ministers and rabbis,

00:42:47.471 --> 00:42:50.320
rallied around to provide
support,

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:54.018
to organize fundraising,
to apply political pressure,

00:42:54.018 --> 00:42:58.170
and countless acts of
compassion and charity.

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:04.429
A heartrending and beautiful
reminder of this is the AIDS

00:43:04.429 --> 00:43:09.349
Quilt, which is part of the
Names Project.

00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:12.092
Their stated goals are to
provide a creative means for

00:43:12.092 --> 00:43:14.974
remembrance and healing;
to illustrate the enormity of

00:43:14.974 --> 00:43:17.998
the AIDS epidemic;
to increase public awareness of

00:43:17.998 --> 00:43:20.237
AIDS;
to assist with HIV prevention

00:43:20.237 --> 00:43:22.835
education;
and to raise funds for

00:43:22.835 --> 00:43:26.630
community-based AIDS service
organizations.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.985
Anyone can commemorate someone
who died of AIDS by making a

00:43:29.985 --> 00:43:32.668
panel of the quilt,
which is the size of a

00:43:32.668 --> 00:43:35.039
gravestone, three feet by six
feet,

00:43:35.039 --> 00:43:38.152
with the name,
the dates, and any memorabilia

00:43:38.152 --> 00:43:38.719
on it.
 

00:43:38.719 --> 00:43:43.489
A documentary about the project
called Common Threads won

00:43:43.489 --> 00:43:48.110
an Academy Award in 1990 and is
available for you to watch.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:54.413
In October of 1996,
the AIDS Quilt was unfurled in

00:43:54.413 --> 00:43:56.599
Washington, DC.
 

00:43:56.599 --> 00:44:00.913
It was a mile long,
extending from the Washington

00:44:00.913 --> 00:44:03.340
Monument to Capitol Hill.
 

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.581
I just want to say it's a
little different living through

00:44:07.581 --> 00:44:10.309
an epidemic than reading about
it.

00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:13.355
Many thoughtful religious
people were jolted into

00:44:13.355 --> 00:44:17.161
reexamining their proper role in
this crisis, with regards to

00:44:17.161 --> 00:44:19.130
human sexuality and health.
 

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.409
The Episcopal Bishop of Newark,
New Jersey,

00:44:21.409 --> 00:44:24.465
John Shelby Spong,
became famous with the press in

00:44:24.465 --> 00:44:28.519
the 1980s because of his active
role in ordaining gay priests,

00:44:28.519 --> 00:44:31.429
and his work against homophobia.
 

00:44:31.429 --> 00:44:34.449
He, along with others,
formed a taskforce on changing

00:44:34.449 --> 00:44:36.829
patterns in sexuality and family
life,

00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:38.909
to examine changes in modern
society,

00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:43.942
and to make recommendations for
study for the National Episcopal

00:44:43.942 --> 00:44:45.619
Convention in 1987.
 

00:44:45.619 --> 00:44:49.168
The taskforce recommended,
in relation to premarital

00:44:49.168 --> 00:44:52.088
sexual activity,
"that all relationships

00:44:52.088 --> 00:44:55.626
are to be assessed in terms of
their capacity to manifest marks

00:44:55.626 --> 00:44:58.512
of the realm of God;
healing, reconciliation,

00:44:58.512 --> 00:45:01.396
compassion, mutuality and
concern for others,

00:45:01.396 --> 00:45:04.478
both within and beyond one's
immediate circle of

00:45:04.478 --> 00:45:05.789
intimacy."
 

00:45:05.789 --> 00:45:08.083
With regard to issues of
committed homosexual

00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:10.681
relationships,
the report suggested that

00:45:10.681 --> 00:45:14.998
"ideally homosexual couples
would find within the community

00:45:14.998 --> 00:45:17.264
of the faithful,
the congregation,

00:45:17.264 --> 00:45:20.108
the same recognition and
affirmation which nurtures and

00:45:20.108 --> 00:45:23.110
sustains heterosexual couples
and their relationships;

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:26.838
including, where appropriate,
liturgies which recognize and

00:45:26.838 --> 00:45:28.960
bless such relationships."
 

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.429
Many religious people were
eager to become a source of

00:45:31.429 --> 00:45:34.304
encouragement and healing,
instead of guilt and shame,

00:45:34.304 --> 00:45:37.920
for the myriad of people who do
not fit into narrowly defined,

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.010
unrealistic sexual roles.
 

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:45.585
Reactions to the AIDS epidemic
has caused ongoing struggles

00:45:45.585 --> 00:45:48.730
within traditional religions
around the issue of gay

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.690
relationships and premarital sex
education,

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:55.179
and this continued into the new
millennium.

00:45:55.179 --> 00:45:58.869
Three days after the tragedy of
9/11,

00:45:58.869 --> 00:46:02.039
the Reverend Jerry Falwell
pronounced on the 700 Club,

00:46:02.039 --> 00:46:05.282
the Christian TV show:
"I really believe that the

00:46:05.282 --> 00:46:08.713
pagans and the abortionists,
and the feminists and the gays

00:46:08.713 --> 00:46:11.320
and the lesbians that are
actively trying to make an

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.311
alternative lifestyle,
the ACLU, People for the

00:46:14.311 --> 00:46:16.206
American Way,
all of them,

00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:18.989
who have tried to secularize
America,

00:46:18.989 --> 00:46:21.489
I point the finger in their
face and say,

00:46:21.489 --> 00:46:25.911
'You helped this happen.'"
CNN sat up and took notice of

00:46:25.911 --> 00:46:29.931
this, and gave the executive
director of the National Gay and

00:46:29.931 --> 00:46:33.079
Lesbian Taskforce an opportunity
to respond.

00:46:33.079 --> 00:46:36.333
She answered by saying,
"The terrible tragedy that

00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:39.793
has befallen our nation,
and indeed the entire global

00:46:39.793 --> 00:46:42.806
community,
is the sad byproduct of

00:46:42.806 --> 00:46:43.969
fanaticism.
 

00:46:43.969 --> 00:46:47.135
It has its roots in the same
fanaticism that enables people

00:46:47.135 --> 00:46:50.248
like Jerry Falwell to preach
hate against those who do not

00:46:50.248 --> 00:46:53.463
think,
live, or love in the exact same

00:46:53.463 --> 00:46:54.559
way he does.
 

00:46:54.559 --> 00:46:58.326
The tragedies that have
occurred this week did not occur

00:46:58.326 --> 00:47:02.230
because someone made God mad,
as Dr. Falwell asserts.

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:05.730
They occurred because of hate,
pure and simple.

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:09.481
It's time to move beyond a
place of hate and to a place of

00:47:09.481 --> 00:47:10.139
healing.
 

00:47:10.139 --> 00:47:13.090
We hope that Mr. Falwell will
apologize to the U.S.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:19.289
and world communities."
 

00:47:19.289 --> 00:47:23.396
The sad fact is that any one of
us can get AIDS,

00:47:23.396 --> 00:47:28.900
in the same way that anyone can
be the victim of a terrorist.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.119
You don't have to do anything
to deserve it.

00:47:32.119 --> 00:47:36.440
All you have to do is be in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:40.530
Whether we like it or not,
in this twenty-first century,

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:44.590
we are one overgrown human
family of more than 6.7 billion

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.409
individuals,
packed into a global village.

00:47:48.409 --> 00:47:52.606
The thirty-three million among
us who live with HIV/AIDS are a

00:47:52.606 --> 00:47:56.458
huge reservoir for all sorts of
opportunistic infections,

00:47:56.458 --> 00:47:58.730
because of immune compromise.
 

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:01.530
As a result,
syphilis and TB have made a

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:02.320
comeback.
 

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.679
Multiple-drug-resistant TB is
becoming a growing problem.

00:48:06.679 --> 00:48:10.306
At present, our best hopes for
prevention of HIV/AIDS in the

00:48:10.306 --> 00:48:13.688
future lies in unfettering the
gags on the sex education

00:48:13.688 --> 00:48:15.730
community;
providing condoms;

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:18.775
supporting and promoting
monogamy, regardless of sexual

00:48:18.775 --> 00:48:21.380
preference;
needle exchange programs;

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.800
universal access to family
planning and prenatal care;

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.170
and in funding viral research.
 

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:31.150
Wherever the next killer
epidemic starts,

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:34.655
like AIDS did in Africa,
it won't take long to infect

00:48:34.655 --> 00:48:38.768
the whole earth if governments
insist on playing politics with

00:48:38.768 --> 00:48:42.679
the medical profession and
public health institutions.

00:48:42.679 --> 00:48:45.936
Evidence-based medicine,
not religious revelation,

00:48:45.936 --> 00:48:49.527
should be the basis of decision
making when it comes to

00:48:49.527 --> 00:48:51.190
containing epidemics.
 

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:54.400
Our future relies on clever,
energetic young people,

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.490
like yourselves,
deciding that you're not afraid

00:48:57.490 --> 00:48:59.860
of the hard work and
complicated,

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:04.556
unpopular truths that are an
integral part of maintaining

00:49:04.556 --> 00:49:05.900
public health.
 

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:10.186
Here's a list of questions to
get you started thinking and

00:49:10.186 --> 00:49:14.172
talking about sexually
transmitted diseases and public

00:49:14.172 --> 00:49:15.000
policy.
 

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.253
And I think you're going to
email that to them,

00:49:18.253 --> 00:49:18.820
right?
 

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:22.409
So, you don't have to copy it
down.

00:49:22.409 --> 00:49:23.960
Good luck.
 

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:29.000

00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.316
(energetic music)

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.180
- Okay, greetings. Happy Thursday.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.400
This is my first day of teaching,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.710
so I'm like slowly making the transition

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.420
from, you know, summer to fall

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.880
and public stuff to teaching stuff.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.660
I'm very glad that I can
teach a class on Ukraine.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.580
I'm very glad that you all are here

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.390
to at least try out this class on Ukraine.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.590
Let me just say a word about the way

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.970
the class is going to work

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.800
and see if you have any
questions about that,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.840
and then I will jump into,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.220
you didn't always have a beard.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.220
I'm going to jump into a
kind of introductory lecture

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.760
about what some of the major
themes of the class will be.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.760
So this is a straightforward
survey lecture class.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.160
We're going to cover a lot of,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.600
we're gonna cover a lot of time.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.370
We're gonna be focused on Ukraine,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.320
but not in the sense that
we're trying to prove

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.650
that Ukraine as it
exists now had to exist,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.830
but rather we'll be
concerned with the things

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.370
which made it possible, and
the other kinds of entities

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.490
which were important on the
territory along the way.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.670
And more abstractly, we'll be
concerned with the question of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.300
why this nation, why nations in general,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.010
how do you get from something,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.020
how do you get from nothing to something?

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.580
Why are there nations in general?

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.040
Or if there have to be nations,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.440
why the ones that we have to have?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.050
Which is the ultimate thing,
which seems self-evident,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.350
like if you're produced in
the given educational culture,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.410
then the existence of
the educational system

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.690
and the state that created
it seems self-evident,

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.980
but it's not really.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.500
Like that's the existence of
the United States or Ukraine

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.440
or Russia or any country
is highly contingent,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.390
and frankly, pretty darn unlikely.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.840
And so, the burden of proof
is really on us as historians

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.090
to show how these things are possible,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.030
as opposed to taking them for granted.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.630
So, as I say, this is a
straightforward lecture class.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.220
You're expected to come to lecture.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.720
In week three, we'll have section.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.270
You're expected to come to section.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.947
You're not expected to bribe your TFs,

00:02:13.947 --> 00:02:15.570
but you are expected,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.190
oh, look at all those
heads that perked up.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.730
I was like, there are like, yeah,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.320
there are geographical lines where,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.030
you know, there are places
where that would be expected,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.490
but I'm happy to announce
that Yale University

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.933
is not one of those places.

00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:31.205
I'm noting like

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:32.038
(class laughing)

00:02:32.038 --> 00:02:34.500
- I'm noting like undergraduate wisdom,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.583
which I'm ignoring.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.840
There are things that
I don't want to know.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.070
So where was I?

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.780
So lecture class.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.510
Two exams. Map quiz next week.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.390
Map quiz, take that very generally.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.060
I might ask you questions on the map quiz,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.520
very simple questions which
have to do with the readings

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.440
assigned up to that point.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.420
If you do the reading
and you look at the maps,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.010
it's gonna be very straightforward.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.110
If you don't do the reading
and you don't look at the maps,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.070
you're gonna be baffled.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.020
You're not going to be able to fake it.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.090
It's gonna be a terrible experience

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.290
and you'll go home crying.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.200
Okay. So it's meant to be easy,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.610
and the reason why I do a map quiz

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.300
is because geography is kind of one of

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.330
the great missing things from
the way that we do history,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.550
along with military history,
which has gone missing,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.020
which is a bit awkward right now

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.570
that nobody does military history anymore.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.760
No, I mean, it's a serious problem,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.890
actually that we have a lot of history

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.930
of like the discourse of
war and the culture of war,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.640
which is interesting and important,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.770
but we have relatively little

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.270
straightforward battlefield history,

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.180
which means that the journalists
writing about the war now

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.777
tend to move very quickly into,

00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:42.510
"Oh, what's Putin thinking?"

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.970
Or you know, like all the
things that we find comfortable,

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.920
like the psychology of
people we don't know.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.110
We move very quickly into those things

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.620
as opposed to how do logistics
work and why does it matter

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.360
if it's a steppe rather than hills,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.930
and what is partisan warfare like,

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.640
and these things that used to be known,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.950
but which we've kind of
discarded in the 21st century.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.740
Okay. That was my big
conservative move for the day.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.000
I'll go back to being myself now,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
but it is actually very, very important.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.620
So what we're gonna be doing
is moving through time,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.570
starting the next lecture.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.160
Well, next lecture, this is just,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.470
I'm gonna be giving a very
general introduction this time.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.600
Next lecture, we're
gonna talk theoretically

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.520
about the origins of nations.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.350
Try to open up that question,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.850
go through some of the thinking

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.923
about where nations come from.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.070
Our guiding thinker on this

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.440
is gonna be a fellow
called Ivan Rudnytsky,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.750
who is a very important Ukrainian thinker

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.500
and kind of uniquely situated
to address this question

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.510
for reasons which are going
to become clear to you,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.460
I hope, over time.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.170
And then beginning, then
you'll have the map quiz,

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.360
and then beginning September 13th,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.580
we are going to start moving through time,

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.080
beginning with the ancient world,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.840
into the middle ages, into
the Renaissance, and so on.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.490
So it's all pretty straightforward.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.230
I don't wanna spend too
much time talking about it,

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.795
but if you have a question
about the form of the class,

00:05:03.795 --> 00:05:06.633
please go ahead and ask.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.830
Yeah? It's all clear?

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.060
Okay.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.273
All right.

00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:17.100
So what I'm gonna do now is
I'm going to just enter into

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.340
some of the big questions that are raised

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.550
by the moment that we are in now.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.420
So history is not about
how everything has to be

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.920
the way that it is now.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.940
Nevertheless, it would
be naive not to notice

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.920
that the way that we start
thinking about history

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.690
has to do with the
predicaments and the questions

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.340
that are raised by the present moment.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.500
You can't get away from
the present moment.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.400
As you might have noticed,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.289
it's very hard to get away
from the present moment,

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.280
but what you can do is you
can use the present moment

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.340
to reflect, right, to reflect,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.860
and then when you've reflected,
the history that you learned

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.770
might make the present
moment more comprehensible.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.390
So I'm not gonna say that
the purpose of this class

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.330
is to make the Russian war
against Ukraine make sense.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.820
What I am going to say
though is that the war

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.910
perhaps is an occasion for us to go back

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.890
and understand this history.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.770
Some of the things which
might seem mysterious,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.110
like how is a war like this possible

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.390
might seem less mysterious.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.120
Some of the claims that
are made about the war

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.600
might seem easier to dismiss
or easier to understand

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.930
once we have the history under our belts.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.750
So let me start with where we are.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.700
Where we are right now,

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.460
it is what, the 31st of
August or something like that?

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.340
Where we are right now is that
the Ukrainian armed forces

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.490
are undertaking a limited offensive

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.860
in the the Kherson oblast of Ukraine,

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.970
which is right in the
Southern part of the country.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.130
Kherson, it's an interesting name,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.040
if you think about it, it
doesn't actually, if you have,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.360
if you know anything
about Slavic languages,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.160
it doesn't sound particularly Slavic,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.590
and that's because it's not.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.190
Kherson was named after an
older ancient Greek settlement

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.650
on the Crimean peninsula.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.060
It was named by Katherine the Great

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.103
when she founded the city.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.640
By the way that ancient Greek city.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.010
which was also called Kherson, is now,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.070
the ruins of it are now
in a suburb of Sevastopol,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.470
which is another city name
which you might be hearing of.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.110
Things are exploding there at the moment.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.440
Sevastopol is part of the
territory in the extreme south

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.163
of Ukraine and Crimea, which
was occupied by Russia in 2014.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.840
So these place names which
seem exotic and mysterious

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.870
point us back to a history

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.520
which is actually durable
and comprehensible.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.520
So the Greeks are the oldest documented

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.600
inhabitants of Ukraine.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.040
I'm not gonna say the oldest inhabitants,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.300
because there are the Scythians

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.530
and there are are all kinds of other people

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.940
who left other kinds of traces,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.450
but in terms of continuous
documentation of presence,

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.550
the Greeks have been
there for the longest,

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.080
along with the Jews.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.050
So the Jews and the Greeks
are the longest documented

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.580
inhabitants of Ukraine,

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.380
which suggests that familiar
concepts of classical history,

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.380
whether coming from a
Greek side or coming from

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.950
a Jewish side are going
to turn out to be useful

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.383
in application to Ukraine.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.140
The history of Ukraine
as we're going to see

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.190
is about an axis of south to north.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.200
Okay, I realize I'm now
getting into geography

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.260
and heads are spinning already.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.880
North is like, when
you're looking at a map,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.843
it's the up one.

00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:37.200
(students and professor chuckling)

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.043
- I'm sorry.

00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:41.910
(students and professor chuckling)

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.360
- And south is the other way.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.713
So when we think of it,

00:08:45.713 --> 00:08:47.730
people talk about Ukraine
in terms of east and west,

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.790
and that, I just wanna say,
that's a very recent phenomenon.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.370
The axis on which early Ukrainian history

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.610
is going to emerge, or the
history of Kyivan Rus',

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.520
which is the first big
documented polity in this region

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.180
is a north, it's a North-South axis.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.880
It has to do with Vikings,

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.400
which is a major theme in
European history, right?

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.800
The Viking age, which begins
in the eighth century.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.530
It has to do with the
encounter of the Vikings

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.570
and the continuation of the Roman empire,

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.875
which is known as Byzantium,

00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:22.560
which is capital in Constantinople,
which is now Istanbul.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.550
It Kyivan Rus', our history,
begins with an encounter

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.380
of this major Northern development

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.450
and this major Southern development,

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.090
which meet in Kyiv and sets something off,

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.220
which is in some way continuing.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.140
This something that is set off,

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.001
we're gonna be following
for a thousand years.

00:09:40.001 --> 00:09:42.270
The state, which is founded, as I've said,

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.340
is called Rus' or Kyivan Rus',

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.173
I will describe,

00:09:45.173 --> 00:09:47.580
I'll talk about why it's
called Rus' later on.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.630
It's very interesting,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.970
but the territories in
question are also going to be

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.350
governed by other entities

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.760
like the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.610
the biggest state in Europe
for quite a long time.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.040
Poland major, the major
power of the region

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.090
for quite a long time,

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.370
the Ottoman empire,
which we cannot forget,

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.780
and if I get through
the middle of this class

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.130
and I haven't talked
enough about the Ottomans,

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.150
I want you guys to call
me on it because like

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.003
there's this whole thing about Kyivan Rus'

00:10:11.003 --> 00:10:12.720
and like Putin talks about it,

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.950
then Zelensky talks about it,

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.890
and both Putin and Zelensky
are named after the guy

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.030
who was baptized, maybe, in
order to found Kyivan Rus',

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.860
who's is called Valdemar,

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.180
because of course he was a Viking

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.560
and not a Russian or Ukrainian,

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.130
cause Russia and Ukraine
didn't exist at the time.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.050
But the Viking who got baptized,

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.020
who was called Valdemar in 988,

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.207
that name then becomes
Velodymyr in Ukrainian

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:38.040
and Vladimir in Russian.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.300
Right, so that contemporary heads of state

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.430
of these two countries are
named after this figure

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:46.083
who a thousand years ago maybe
converted to Christianity.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.717
So there's this Kyivan Rus' business,

00:10:48.717 --> 00:10:51.690
and we're gonna follow Kyivan
Rus' and it's fascinating,

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.780
but we have to remember
that the whole south of the

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.230
territory that we're talking
about was never actually part

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.580
of Kyivan Rus' right?

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.070
So Putin is now making
this war in Ukraine,

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.360
and part of his logic,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.150
as I'm gonna talk about
is that Russia and Ukraine

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.010
have always been one
people because of a Viking

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.840
maybe got baptized a thousand years ago,

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.090
which I want you guys to
understand is not a persuasive

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.560
historical argument, okay?

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.030
If we get one thing out of this class,

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.347
it's gonna be that if a dictator tells you

00:11:16.347 --> 00:11:19.140
a thousand years ago,
somebody got baptized,

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.240
that doesn't mean your nation
is the same as his nation.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.510
If we can get through that,
we'll have done a good job.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.700
So at least for the first
15 minutes of class.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.910
But my point is that we cannot
forget that these Southern

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.470
territories were not part
of Kyivan Rus' at all,

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.080
where the fighting is
happening now was not,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.210
it was part of the ancient Greek world.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.240
It was part of the Ottoman
world for a long time,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.790
but it was not actually
part of Kyivan Rus'.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.360
Southern Ukraine has a
different history and it is

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.770
brought into this larger
Ukrainian thing later on.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.591
So let's. I'm just saying that
because we have to mark the

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.650
Ottoman empire and we have to mark Islam,

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.670
and in general, by the way,
we have to mark Ukraine

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:07.110
as a major center, not
just of Christian history,

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.330
because when you focus on Kyiv

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.100
and the conversion to Christianity,

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.950
then you're in this kind of
Christian teleological arc.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.140
Somebody, maybe or maybe
didn't get dunked in water

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.760
and therefore it's Christian forever,

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.060
but Ukraine is actually a center of

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.660
Muslim and Jewish and
Christian civilization,

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.910
and this is one of the things
which makes it interesting

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.100
and of note and in the ancient period,

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.250
it was a center of what you
could think of as a contest

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.620
between those three
monotheistic traditions

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.540
to convert the pagans who lived there,

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.973
which we'll get to in a later lecture.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.650
For now though, what I wanna
make sure that we get to

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.880
is this issue of how you get to be a nation.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.950
Okay, so that's gonna be
one of our major themes,

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.930
and I don't mean it
teleologically, just to stress,

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.600
I don't mean why Ukraine had to be,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.430
because that's a terrible question.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.140
As soon as you're in the world of

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.870
why a nation had to be,

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.740
you've obliviated, you've
eliminated, you've erased

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.110
all human agency in
the whole story, right?

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.720
If I'm able to say right
now from the pulpit

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.020
Ukraine had to exist, then
we're removing everything

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.480
which makes history interesting, right,

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.190
the human choices along the way.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.890
The way people saw the
circumstances they were in,

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.450
what people thought was possible,

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.680
what they thought they were doing,

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.240
and what they sometimes even did.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.560
All that goes away.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.557
If I can say,

00:13:26.557 --> 00:13:29.190
"Oh, there had to be America
or there had to be Russia,

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.660
or there had to be China."

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.460
There didn't have to
be any of these things.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.950
We can explain how they came into being,

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.590
but what we can't say, and
this is what Putin does,

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.690
we can't say that it's predetermined.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.950
As soon as we say it's predetermined,

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.210
this is no longer a history class,

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.043
it's in some kind of,

00:13:43.043 --> 00:13:45.150
we're in some kind of
exercise in, you know,

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.860
applied physics or something.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.230
Okay, but the bad, so there's a bad answer

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.010
to why, you know, to
where history comes from,

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.110
which is that things had
to be the way they are,

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.770
and that bad answer is
closely related to this war

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.310
because Putin gave that
bad answer in July of 2021,

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.860
when he wrote an incredibly
long, for a politician,

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.630
not long for you guys,

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.727
an incredibly long essay which he called

00:14:09.727 --> 00:14:13.023
"On the historical unity
of Russia and Ukraine"

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.950
and his bad answer is that
things are the way they are

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.340
because they had to be
this way basically, right?

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.470
Russia and Ukraine have
always been together,

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.160
and if they're not together,
that's the result of alien,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.470
non-historical forces.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.930
This is really important, by the way,

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.270
because when a tyrant makes an argument

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.700
about how history has to be,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.130
then some of the forces that are actually

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.782
resident in history,

00:14:39.782 --> 00:14:44.130
then get classified as being
ahistorical or non-historical

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.470
or exotic or alien, right?

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.830
So in Putin's telling you the story,

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.800
all the Lithuanian stuff
and all of the Polish stuff

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.500
and all of the Jewish
stuff, for that matter,

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.740
all the things which aren't
about Christianity or Russia

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.760
are now suddenly exotic, alien, foreign.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.500
They're not really history.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.260
They're the things that have to be removed

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.870
so that history can go the
way that it's supposed to go,

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.350
and that is precisely a rationale for war.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.840
In fact, it is the rationale for this war,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.180
because the argument for this war is that

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.280
Ukrainians don't know who they really are

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.090
because they've been polluted
by all this Polish stuff

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.820
or Lithuanian stuff or Habsburg stuff,

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:31.820
or maybe latterly European
Union stuff or American stuff.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.730
So you have to peel away
all this artificial things

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.740
to get down to who they really are,

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.130
and they may not know who they
really are and that's tragic

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.900
and we have to apply enough violence

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.480
so that they can understand
who they really are, right?

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.580
And once you're in that
way of seeing things,

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.010
then of course the war makes
perfect sense to you, right?

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:53.070
And so the way that history is presented

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.550
has an integral connection with
the decision to make a war,

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.090
and also for the way that
a war seems to make sense

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.800
while it's going on, right,

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.990
while it's going on to people
who are taking part of it.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.610
So the point is though that
is not that we're gonna

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.140
start with this bad history

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.580
because it's the right kind of history,

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.060
the point is that the bad
history or what I would prefer

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.180
to call the myth or the political memory

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.240
gives us an occasion to see how history

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.560
might actually have been.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.500
It's a kind of, the bad
history is a kind of

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:30.500
invitation to what might
actually be more interesting.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:35.010
Okay. So what's wrong with the idea,

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.350
let me just open this up
to you guys very quickly.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.200
What's wrong with, this is
kind of a trick question.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.807
I'm sorry. What's wrong with
an essay which is titled

00:16:43.807 --> 00:16:46.647
"On the historical unity
of Russia and Ukraine?"

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.053
Go for it.

00:16:51.053 --> 00:16:53.100
- [Student] There is no
historical unity of Russia.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.170
- Okay. That's alright.
I'll give you that.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.540
But I'm looking for yes. Okay.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.250
Why not? I mean, why not?

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.500
Because you don't think so?

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:05.170
- [Student] No, I think it's been forced,

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.214
but the unity has been forced.

00:17:06.214 --> 00:17:07.047
- Okay.

00:17:07.047 --> 00:17:08.860
- [Student] Doesn't
never like substantial.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:09.963
- Okay. All right.

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:14.250
I'm going for something
more fundamental. Yeah?

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.780
- [Student] Russia and
Ukraine might not have existed

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.328
in the way we talked about them.

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:21.453
- Good. Okay. That's good. That's good.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.030
Russia and Ukraine as nations
definitely didn't exist

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.250
in the year 988, right?

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:33.690
The nation is a modern historical
construct characterized by

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:38.640
the notion that you feel a
kind of solidarity with people

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.728
you don't know.

00:17:39.728 --> 00:17:42.060
That's Benedict Anderson
imagined community.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.303
It's a good argument that you,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.200
somebody else is American
or Ukrainian or Chinese,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.610
and you think you have
something in common with them,

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.110
even though you don't
know them personally,

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.100
that's the nation.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.080
The nation also involves a certain,

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.690
at least a certain notion of equality.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.190
We may not be equal in every ways,

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.183
but I'm not more American
than you are, right,

00:18:02.183 --> 00:18:04.020
if you're American

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.320
We're, at least in the,
at least notionally,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.683
we're equal as members of a nation, right?

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.330
That does not exist in the ancient world,

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.320
or it doesn't exist in the medieval world.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.880
So that's a good one.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.730
Now, can we go even deeper than that?

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.110
All right, I'm gonna have to
answer my own trick question.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.070
Yeah, go for it.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.420
- [Student] This might be a long shot,

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.600
but this statement itself
is inherently contradictory.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.512
Can you say the unity,

00:18:32.512 --> 00:18:34.974
but he's also recognizing
Ukraine sovereignty

00:18:34.974 --> 00:18:38.520
by saying that Russia and
Ukraine is separate entities.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.260
- That's kind of where, I mean,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.660
I'm gonna give you like
extra credit points for that,

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.200
because I think you're right.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.250
And I think what I'm aiming
for is the actual language

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.420
of the statement.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.933
The way that "On the historical
unity of Russia and Ukraine"

00:18:55.779 --> 00:18:58.500
plays a certain trick.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.503
The trick is that if I
begin a title with, "On"

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.710
the thing that's there is
supposed to be real, right?

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.380
So if the title is "On
the historical unity

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.213
of Russia and Ukraine"

00:19:11.213 --> 00:19:13.830
the trick is that, well,
since it's "On" this,

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.780
that thing must exist, right?

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.362
If I write a book which says

00:19:17.362 --> 00:19:22.362
"On quick chess strategies
to defeat Garry Kasparov"

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.230
then it's like, that
thing must exist, right,

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.570
even though it doesn't exist, right?

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.240
But if I say on this thing, then it exists

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.720
and so that kind of language,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.880
the kind of implicit
assertion of existence

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.250
is non-historical language.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.650
It's the language of legend,
the language of myth.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.260
It's tricky language
which gets you thinking

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.390
in terms of categories of eternity,

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.470
categories of durability,
categories which isn't changed,

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:50.460
what things which don't change,

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.070
which leads you to where Putin is,

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:58.070
which his idea that some
things are, as he says,

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.860
predetermined, right, which
is a very strong word.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.650
His idea is that because there
was a baptism in Kyiv in 988,

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.780
the rest of it is predetermined

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.300
and anything which doesn't go
the way it's supposed to go

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.960
is somehow exotic or foreign
and has to be suppressed,

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.340
and then historical unity, I mean,

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.890
I'm gonna make your point
a little bit more strongly.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.110
It's not just that Russia and Ukraine,

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.900
there's no such thing as
historical unity, right?

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.730
History is not about unity.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.610
History is about, okay, I'm
gonna throw this one open.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.100
What's history about in two words?

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.877
You can have two, you have
three if one of them's an "and."

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:34.653
War and peace.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.070
I guess that's what I deserve
for my military history

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.429
comment earlier on.

00:20:39.429 --> 00:20:40.987
(students laughing)

00:20:40.987 --> 00:20:42.690
- I mean, it's not bad. It's
not a bad answer by the way.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.710
It's a pretty good answer.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.000
Anything. Anyone else wanna go for it?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.960
Yeah.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.160
- [Student] People.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.270
- Did it in one word.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.690
That's good. It's people
who can write stuff down,

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.430
actually, that's where history stops

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:58.430
is the line between history
and archeology or anthropology.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.020
History is all about written records.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.853
So we're gonna do a lot of warmup

00:21:01.853 --> 00:21:03.570
before we get to written records,

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.480
but one of the reasons
why baptism is important

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.310
in the history of Eastern
Europe or Europe in general

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.610
is that with baptism and
Christianity comes written language

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.320
and with written language
comes the ability

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.818
to make different kinds of interpretations

00:21:14.818 --> 00:21:16.530
where historians are comfortable.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.610
All right, I'm gonna
give this one more shot.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.660
What's history about?

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.930
Don't you guys dream of,
isn't this like your dream

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.730
you're gonna come to Yale and
a professor's gonna ask you

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.470
what history's all about and
you're gonna raise your hand

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:29.775
and say something brilliant?

00:21:29.775 --> 00:21:30.608
(class laughing)

00:21:30.608 --> 00:21:31.710
- Like isn't that what
you guys dream about?

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:32.883
This is your moment.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.561
Yeah, Jack.

00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:36.923
- [Jack] States in society.

00:21:36.923 --> 00:21:37.756
- State in society.

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:38.610
That's good. That's good.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:39.960
That's pretty good. Okay.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.750
So what I'm thinking about
is something even more basic

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.770
and dumb, which is change in continuity.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.750
Okay, so you don't have
to write that down.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.220
It's a very fundamental thing

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.860
that sometimes things change
and sometimes they don't

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.290
and history is aware
of both of them, right,

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.530
and you're in, history is aware,

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.530
so the historical unity is
a non-historical concept

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.056
because what it does is that it's a trick

00:22:05.056 --> 00:22:06.120
because historical
doesn't mean historical,

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.970
it means unchanging, right?

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.630
Historical unity in that
phrase means forever.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.250
It means eternal, right

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.450
It doesn't actually mean historical,

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.910
cause historical would mean it changes.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.620
Maybe there was some unity at some point,

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:20.453
but if it's historical,

00:22:20.453 --> 00:22:22.980
then it would change because
that's what history is.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.830
History is change as well as continuity.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.300
So history is about change in continuity,

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.370
which means it's about
ends and beginnings,

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.493
and it's also about unpredictability.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:34.500
Okay, so as you might have gathered,

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.800
this lecture is also because
we're doing this big question,

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.900
we're handling this big subject of war,

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.190
and we're trying to do this big question

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.410
of where nations come from
at the very beginning.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.550
I'm trying to do just a little bit

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:48.300
about what history actually
is, cause we're gonna need it.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.440
So one of the things which,

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.950
since history is about
beginnings and endings,

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.960
it's also unpredictable, right?

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.660
It's about things that
you couldn't expect,

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.250
and that may seem counterintuitive,

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.083
because you probably think,

00:23:00.083 --> 00:23:02.460
well, okay you probably don't,

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.840
cause I know you're
all very sophisticated,

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.390
but someone in some other
classroom might think

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.130
history is about old dusty books

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.670
and we know what's gonna
happen in the old dusty books.

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:12.690
But here's the thing,

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.110
even if you read all the old
dusty books that you wanted

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.990
about the year 1439 and you became

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.570
the world's leading expert on 1439,

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:25.680
you still would not know
what happened in 1440, right?

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.790
That's the level you wouldn't have,

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.300
and that's the level of
unpredictability of history,

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.340
and it comes up to the present.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.320
You can read all, I mean
you could know everything

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.260
you could possibly
humanly know about 2021,

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.080
but you wouldn't know
what's gonna happen in 2022.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.920
You just wouldn't.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.050
It's only afterwards
that it all seems like

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.607
it had to happen, right?
Like up until February 24th.

00:23:45.607 --> 00:23:47.580
"Of course Russia's not
gonna invade Ukraine."

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.637
After February 24th.

00:23:48.637 --> 00:23:50.580
"Oh, of course Russia was
gonna invade Ukraine."

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.480
That's how our minds work and
history is there to remind us

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.030
that actually we're wrong
pretty much all the time,

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.340
that things are not
actually predictable, right?

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.480
That what people expect to happen

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.040
is generally what doesn't happen,

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.509
and that novelty is an authentic thing,

00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:08.730
that there are new things
which come about all the time.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:10.890
In our case, the new thing
that we'll be thinking about

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:15.890
the most is nature. I
mean, sorry is the nation.

00:24:17.735 --> 00:24:21.930
Now one of the things which gets elided,

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.960
and I've already mentioned
this and it's pretty important

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.552
in the notion that history
is some kind of eternity

00:24:27.552 --> 00:24:29.430
or some kind of repetition.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.342
Like you may have heard the phrase,

00:24:31.342 --> 00:24:34.290
you may have heard the idea
that history repeats itself.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.880
I don't know about you guys.
I hear it all the time.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.417
Because whenever I talk about
the past, then people say,

00:24:37.417 --> 00:24:38.790
"Well, history is repeating itself"

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.230
because this thing is like this thing,

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.490
but if history really,

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:43.650
oops, I'm getting out of
the camera view probably.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.000
I'm not used to doing this.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:50.520
If history repeats itself,

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.820
that would mean that nothing
we do matters, right?

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.620
If history literally repeated itself,

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.150
then there would be no human agency.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:01.110
It's the same thing as
saying things never change.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.330
If things change according to a pattern,

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.430
that also means no human agency, right,

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:08.769
and so the notion that
history is a cycle, right,

00:25:08.769 --> 00:25:11.610
there was a time when we were great

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.830
and now we have to make
ourselves great again,

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.090
like the notion that there's a cycle,

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.400
that there was a Golden Age
and then something went wrong

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.570
and then we correct it.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.270
That's also not historical.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.580
That's also a way of
eliminating human agency, right?

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.500
So history doesn't repeat.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.520
It doesn't repeat.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.720
You learn things from history

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.340
which can then help you
recognize other things.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.199
You might see some certain patterns,

00:25:31.199 --> 00:25:33.900
but history doesn't repeat.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:38.900
Okay, so the thing which goes
missing in these accounts,

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:42.810
which I want us to get
better at recognizing

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.490
over the course of this class,

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.350
and as we think about the nation,

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:50.103
is the notion of human agency.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.350
Not volunteerism,

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.750
like not the idea that you
can do whatever you want,

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.750
but the notion of human agency that you,

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:02.040
history helps us to identify
the structures as best we can,

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.590
and then the better we
understand the structures,

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:08.160
the better we see what
humans can and can't do

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.900
or could imagine that they can
do within those structures.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.600
So when we do history, we're trying to,

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.740
as it were objectively,

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.620
understand the situation around a person,

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.860
but we're also trying to
subjectively understand

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.860
what that person might have
been thinking or trying to do,

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.410
and we never give up on
the second part, right?

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.860
So to take the example of
this baptism in 988 to,

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.930
don't worry, we'll return
to it over and over again,

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:38.352
but when Valdemar got himself baptized,

00:26:38.352 --> 00:26:41.250
we know he was not thinking
about Russia and Ukraine

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:44.430
a thousand years later, like
that we can be sure about.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.380
We can be pretty sure
he wasn't even thinking

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.750
about Christianity because we know enough

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.960
about his predicament to say
what he was probably thinking

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.980
about was geopolitics and
what form of conversion

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.400
would be best to preserve
his own rule, right?

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.280
And we'll try to explain
how that all works out,

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.710
but what we're always trying to do

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.960
is to understand the
situation around someone

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.200
which is, so to speak, of
an objective undertaking.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.900
But then we're also trying to get inside

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.090
the individual actors and their own minds

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:18.210
and recognize that they have
a subjective appreciation

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.450
of these, and you can never quite do away

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.300
with that tension between
what I'm calling very simply

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:29.300
the objective and the
subjective forms of history.

00:27:31.442 --> 00:27:36.390
Okay, so we've already
talked about many of the ways

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.483
that this kind of myth
of eternity is wrong.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.940
Another way that I wanted to talk about it

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.940
is in terms of diversity
or in terms of change.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:53.990
If I give you a myth of a Golden Age,

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.720
I'm usually getting rid of diversity.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.630
I'm usually getting rid of
all the interesting stuff.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.420
If I'm talking about how,
and this is, by the way,

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.550
all myths of a Golden Age are pretty much

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.020
structurally the same.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.520
Interestingly, it always turns out

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.870
that we were the good guys.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.350
Right, like try to think
of a myth of a Golden Age

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.900
where the other guys were the good guys.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.450
If it's, funnily, it all kind
of comes down to the same thing.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.340
It's aways, we were the good guys.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.680
We were innocent, and
then the bad people came

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.470
and they polluted us or
they did something very bad.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.630
It's structurally always the same,

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.910
and it doesn't even matter
whether you're an empire or not.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.860
You can be the most powerful
empire in the world,

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.290
the most powerful empire in
the most powerful country

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.110
in the world, hint USA,

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.060
and you can still come up with a story

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.700
of how you were the victim
and the other people came

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:46.410
and they polluted you, but the
structure is always the same,

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:51.300
and so when you have a story
of which Putin's version

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.550
of the baptism in Kyiv is one example.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:57.300
You have a story about how
everything was always static.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.950
Everything was pure, right?

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.260
That's why the baptism, by
the way, is so attractive.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.790
It's not that Putin
actually goes to church

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:05.610
or that the Russian church
really exists as such,

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:10.610
but baptism is a notion of,
it's a cleansing, right,

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.490
it's a purifying, it's a starting again,

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.450
and that's why it's such an
attractive image in this story.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:20.430
The baptism allows us
to forget all the things

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.700
that happened before and
present history or the past

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.520
as this kind of clean unity where anything

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.910
which was polluting came from the outside,

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.460
and that is a way of
getting rid of diversity

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.620
or getting rid of the things which might,

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.750
as historians or as students of history,

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:40.920
we might actually find to be interesting,

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.660
where it gets rid of things
coming from other places.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.110
It gets rid of origins.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.219
It gets rid of innovation.

00:29:50.219 --> 00:29:51.750
It gets rid of all of
the interesting stuff.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.153
Like, for example, the alphabet.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.510
The alphabet might seem like
something which is eternal.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.510
I mean, when was the last time you guys

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.860
thought about the alphabet?

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.180
All right, that's not the
question that you were dreaming

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.827
your professor was gonna ask
you the first week of Yale.

00:30:08.827 --> 00:30:10.800
"He was asking me about the alphabet, mom.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.187
I can't believe it. I studied so hard."

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.430
So the alphabet is a really
interesting creation.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.590
It was actually only
invented once, like a lot of things

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:21.960
that we take for granted and
then copied a bunch of times,

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.232
the specific Cyrillic alphabet,

00:30:24.232 --> 00:30:28.290
which came to Kyiv after the baptism,

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.660
was invented by a couple
of, we'll talk about this,

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.600
a couple of Byzantine priests
who were trying to convert,

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.270
not Kyiv, but Moravia, not then,

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:37.710
but a couple centuries before,

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.140
and they had an interesting career

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.030
and it wandered and ended up in Kyiv,

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.040
and then suddenly you have this alphabet.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.710
And then that Cyrillic
alphabet can seem like

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.483
a kind of eternal marker of
like east and west or whatever

00:30:49.483 --> 00:30:54.270
once it's established, but
it's actually an innovation

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:57.330
which came from the outside, right,

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.360
like, for that matter Christianity itself.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.220
So when you focus on how things,

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.930
or if you pretend that things are static,

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.030
what you're doing is you're
excluding all the diversity,

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.170
all of the innovation,

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.233
and all the things which
came from the outside.

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:15.240
What we're gonna be
trying to do in this class

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.670
is make the opposite point.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.370
That what's interesting about Ukraine

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:22.890
is that rather than being part

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:26.416
of somebody else's myth of purity, right,

00:31:26.416 --> 00:31:31.416
is that Ukraine actually
embodies in a very intense form

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.590
most of the major themes
of European history

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:38.400
and some of the major
themes of European history,

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.933
of world history.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.540
What we're gonna try to be arguing.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.980
is that as a result of
Ukraine's geography,

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.860
as a result of this north-south
axis at the beginning,

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.230
and then east-west axis later on,

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.840
all of the themes of European history

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.670
appear in Ukrainian history,

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.910
just in a slightly more
interesting form, right?

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.340
So the Vikings, for example,

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.960
if you're interested in European history,

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.660
you may be interested in the Vikings.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.300
The Vikings, let's face it,
they're interesting. Okay.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.180
So you have this mainstream
of European development

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:16.200
where the Franks start a
state and the Vikings react

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.300
to the Franks and they
start raiding the Franks

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.950
and they invent these boats

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:23.190
and they travel all over
the world. Very cool.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:27.690
But maybe the single most
lasting trace of the Viking Age

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:29.610
is Kyiv, right?

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:31.110
The Vikings founded states.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.100
They knocked over states.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.660
They founded the states all over the place.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.220
Normandy, for example.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.890
Normandy, as you might
remember, invades England

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:40.320
and establishes England in the
form that we know it today.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.730
Vikings matter a lot,
but Norwegian democracy,

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.050
it also began with Vikings,

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:49.590
but Kyiv may be the single
most interesting legacy

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.590
of the Viking Age, maybe
the most durable legacy

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:53.670
of the Viking Age.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.310
When you look at pictures
of wartime Kyiv now,

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.790
which, you know, where San
Sophia is still standing,

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:03.300
thankfully, like that's a
legacy of Viking civilization.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:08.300
That's a legacy of Vikings
converting to Christianity.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:13.470
If you think about the history
of the Reformation, right?

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.030
Oh the Reformation, we
all know the Reformation

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.740
is a big theme of European history.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.990
Suddenly there are Protestants
as well as Catholics,

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:20.970
and maybe there's a Hundred Years War

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.650
and a third of the population of Germany

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:23.730
is going to get wiped out

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.350
and the printing press comes along

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:26.820
and suddenly there can be disputations

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.983
which seem to lead to a lot of violence.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.790
This whole thing about the
internet causing trouble so far

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:34.500
is like nothing compared
to the printing press.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.810
Like we may get there, but
like the printing press

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:39.060
came along and that was a mess.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.220
But in Ukraine you have the Reformation,

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.900
but it's not Catholics and Protestants,

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.330
it's the Orthodox and the Greek Catholics

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.790
and the Catholic and the
Catholics and the Protestants

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.830
and all kinds of Protestants.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.916
And you have a religious war in 1648,

00:33:51.916 --> 00:33:54.930
which is also a proto national
war, and an anti-colonial war

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:57.600
and something which is
extremely interesting.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.790
So basically everything that
happens in European history

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:01.230
happens in Ukrainian history,

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:05.520
just slightly more intensely
and sometimes slightly earlier.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.440
And indeed one of the
themes or one of the things

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.730
that I hope you'll notice as we go along

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.580
is that George Orwell said this,

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.710
that the hardest thing to notice

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.993
is what's right in front
of your nose, right?

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.410
I don't know, this is
your first week at Yale,

00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:21.240
maybe like 50 years from
now when you're an alum,

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.220
you'll be like, "My professor
told me the hardest thing

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.020
to notice is what's right
in front of your nose."

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:30.020
If you take that away, I'll
also be happy, but that's true.

00:34:30.032 --> 00:34:32.850
The things which are
most intensely obvious

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.400
are very often the things
that are hardest to take on

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.777
and history in a way is actually like,

00:34:37.777 --> 00:34:39.180
"Oh, America's an empire."

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:43.410
I mean, history is a way of
picking up on the obvious

00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:45.540
because it gives it to
you from a whole bunch

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.300
of different angles at the same time,

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.560
and then maybe the obvious

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:53.193
will eventually come through, right?

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:59.210
So the point is that Ukraine
is at this absolute center

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:02.430
of a lot of things, which
we regard as central.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.530
I've given you the Viking
Age and the Reformation,

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:05.970
which may seem a little exotic.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:08.490
It's absolutely at the center
of the First World War.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.650
It's absolutely at the center
of the Second World War.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.780
It's absolutely at the
center of Stalinist terror.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.060
It's absolutely at the
center of the Holocaust.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.320
It's absolutely at the center

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.540
of the collapse of the Soviet Union.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.300
It's at the center of major
historical developments,

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.230
not just ancient and medieval,
but also very contemporary.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.850
But the fact that it's, precisely

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:29.760
the fact that it's at the
center of the development

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.070
makes it hard to see and hard to notice.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:35.640
It's sometimes hard to
direct your gaze at the thing

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.470
which is most important sometimes,

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.090
because where things are most important

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.670
is also where things are darkest, right,

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:46.590
and very often Ukraine
is going to be a kind of

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.423
heart of darkness.

00:35:47.423 --> 00:35:49.620
Who wrote "Heart of Darkness" by the way?

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.520
- [Student] Joseph Conrad.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.353
- Where is he from?

00:35:51.353 --> 00:35:52.470
- [Student] From Poland.

00:35:53.937 --> 00:35:55.530
- Give you one more try.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.363
- [Student] Ukraine?

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.950
- You're guessing though, right?

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:02.580
Yeah. So you're not wrong
that he was from Poland,

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.200
but it's a very interesting trajectory.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.020
So "Heart of Darkness"
is a famous, famous book

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.820
about the race for Africa.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:09.900
It's a remarkable novel.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.310
Conrad's a remarkable writer.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:12.543
Conrad is a Pole.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.480
How does he know about colonialism?

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.120
Because he is from Ukraine, right?

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.070
There's a recent Polish
history book about Ukraine,

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.660
which is called "Poland's
Heart of Darkness"

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.040
which of course the Poles really didn't,

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.020
in general, like to hear,

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.090
but it's a very valid point.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.650
During the Renaissance period,

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.140
as we'll see Polish colonialism

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.700
in Ukraine was incredibly intense,

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.210
and that gives Conrad the background

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:39.540
to understand the
European race for Africa,

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.777
and in turn Hannah Arendt's

00:36:40.777 --> 00:36:43.830
"Origins of Totalitarianism"
is basically one long riff

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:48.300
on Joseph Conrad's novel
"Heart of Darkness."

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.800
And so it's not surprising that Arendt

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.600
actually understands that
Ukraine is important.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.640
Just kind of closing the loop here,

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.496
but a heart of darkness is
something which is hard to see,

00:37:00.496 --> 00:37:03.000
but that doesn't mean
it's unimportant, right?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.270
So things get wiped out of the history

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:10.023
that are precisely the things
that we have to see, okay.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.020
I'm getting towards the
end of the main themes

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.380
that I wanted to make sure
we got introduced here.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.180
So we've talked about what history is.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.703
We've talked about what a nation is.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:25.053
We've talked about the difference
between history and myth.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.710
I've mentioned this
sort of trigger question

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:33.710
of Ukraine exists, why?
Or Ukraine exists how?

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.290
Which is a lot trickier than
it seems at the beginning.

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.540
So if you're living through the 21st century

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.130
and I realize like this
is the only century

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:42.720
that you guys have lived through,

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.313
which I find very troubling.

00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:47.730
One of the, no like, if you're me,

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:48.870
like think about this for a second,

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:52.860
okay, if you're me, you
guys never get older, right?

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.310
Every September I show up and
you're always the same age.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.851
That is really weird, right?

00:37:58.851 --> 00:38:00.633
It's very strange.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.840
And every year I get, every
year I get older, which is very,

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.300
it's very troubling.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.730
But if you're in the 21st century,

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:11.137
there are these moments where you say,

00:38:11.137 --> 00:38:13.020
"Oh, look, Ukraine exists."

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:17.520
Like 2004, what Ukrainians now call

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.350
the Revolution of Dignity or sorry,

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:21.390
the Orange Revolution, 2014,

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.700
the Revolution of Dignity or 2022,

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.140
the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.530
It's very easy and tempting
when Russia invades Ukraine

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:33.297
and Ukraine resists to say,
"Oh, look, now Ukraine exists."

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.220
But that wouldn't be a very
Ukrainian perspective, right?

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.340
The fact that you recognize
something because someone else

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.860
acts doesn't mean that they
just came into existence.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.260
On the contrary, I think the
argument probably runs better

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.610
the other way.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.190
The fact that Ukrainians
were able to resist

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:53.370
the Russian invasion
suggests that the nation

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:55.920
or the civil society
had already consolidated

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.530
to a pretty impressive degree, right,

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:01.950
and the fact that we, and that
would be my American "we,"

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.050
but it was a general assumption,

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:07.290
all thought that Ukraine
would collapse in three days

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.560
might say more about our
misunderstanding of the place

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.240
than it does about the place itself.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.557
And after you misunderstand
it and you say,

00:39:14.557 --> 00:39:15.660
"Well, it doesn't really exist.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.160
It's gonna collapse in three days"

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.460
and then it doesn't collapse,
what's your next move?

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.287
Your next move in order to
rescue your position is to say,

00:39:23.287 --> 00:39:26.280
"Oh, well Ukraine must
have just been created

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.100
by the Russian invasion"
of which is something that

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.360
if you've been following this war at all,

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.377
you will have heard
journalists and others say.

00:39:32.377 --> 00:39:35.730
"Well, you Putin and Putin united Ukraine

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:36.810
with this invasion" right?

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:39.210
And of course it's true that
there's a lot of solidarity

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.190
and so on that wouldn't have
happened without the war,

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.810
but the idea that Putin created Ukraine

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:45.900
by invading it is ludicrous, right?

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.190
You can invade lots of places,

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:48.990
that doesn't mean that they
start to exist as nations.

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.420
That's not how history actually works.

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.230
So that itself, that whole
move that journalists then made

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.750
to say, "Oh, well, Ukraine
exists because Putin"

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.430
is just a way to keep
talking about the thing,

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.840
which people are very
comfortable talking about,

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.370
which is Putin.

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:04.020
If you're a writer in a democracy,

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.490
you're very attracted to authoritarians.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.050
I don't know if you've noticed this trend,

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:09.360
but there's a kind of seductive lure

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.890
of the distant authoritarian.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:11.723
No, it's true.

00:40:11.723 --> 00:40:12.900
Like, the twenties and thirties,

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.310
if you go back to the
twenties and thirties

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:16.429
and you read about the way Americans wrote

00:40:16.429 --> 00:40:18.900
about not just Stalin, but also Hitler,

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.580
you'll see this tendency.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.220
If you're in a democracy,
you're very kind of tempted

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.530
by this idea that, "Oh,
there's somebody over there

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.810
and everything is orderly
and they have a vision,

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:29.610
and this is kind of
interesting" and so on,

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:31.530
we fall, we go for that
again and again and again,

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.330
and with Putin even now though,

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.220
it's much weaker now than
it was before February.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.127
There's this idea that,

00:40:36.127 --> 00:40:39.870
"Oh, he's interesting.
It's kind of seductive.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.780
He's a strong man, and let's
talk about Putin" right?

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.827
Let's talk about Putin and then saying,

00:40:44.827 --> 00:40:47.670
"Oh, Putin created Ukraine by invading"

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.530
is one more way of talking about Putin

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:50.940
rather than talking about Ukraine.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.310
In other words, it's
one more colonial move

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.390
that you're making.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:57.300
Well, okay. They didn't
exist, but if they do exist,

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.170
it's the paradoxical result of
a foreign dictator, right?

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:04.410
Okay. So there are these
triggering moments,

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:05.520
but what I'm trying to suggest are

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.960
these triggering moments
should be triggers

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.620
of our asking ourselves
what actually happened,

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.200
you know, as opposed to
jumping to easy conclusions

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.410
that are convenient,
with which are consistent

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:19.680
with what we already, which
what we already think.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.060
Okay. So we've done history.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:21.893
We've done what history is.

00:41:21.893 --> 00:41:24.480
You guys feel like, you
know what history is now?

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.330
Cause I hope so, because we only
have one lecture for this.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:30.330
We've talked, we've
introduced a little bit,

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:34.380
the difference between history and myth.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.740
There's one more theme
which I wanna just introduce

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.590
very quickly, and it's
a 20th century theme

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:42.450
which I want you to have in mind.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:43.860
The theme is genocide.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.140
And the reason it's a 20th Century theme

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:50.670
is that the 1948 definition
of genocide assumes

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:52.830
that there's such a thing as a people.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:55.830
So Raphael Lemkin, who is
the lawyer who's educating

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:58.230
what's now Ukraine, by the
way, Polish, Jewish lawyer,

00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.910
who's educated in the university,

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:03.453
and what's now Lwow, when he
made up the word genocide,

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.080
he's assuming the existence
of a people, right,

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.600
because genocide is about the intentional

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.980
destruction of a people.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.200
So it assumes that there is
such thing as a people, right,

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.680
what we might call a nation or a society.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.420
So it's a 20th century construction.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:22.007
I mean genocide is the antipode
of the creation of a nation.

00:42:22.007 --> 00:42:24.690
We think of nations are
modern and any attempt

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:27.903
to destroy a nation is also modern, right?

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:31.620
The theme of genocide is a late theme,

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.070
but I want you to keep it
in mind because of this war

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.890
and because of the way that
genocide also asks questions

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:39.750
about where nations come from.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:43.500
This war is a strangely genocidal war.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.890
It's strange in the
sense that it's very rare

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:49.200
for the authors of a war to actually say

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.300
at the beginning that the aim of the war

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.190
is the destruction of another people.

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:55.320
That doesn't happen very often.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.440
That might be the aim, but
for it to be announced openly,

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.930
as it has been in this
war, is pretty unusual.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:02.880
and that's the intent part of genocide.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.880
The practical part of genocide
one can find very easily

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.800
in the hundred thousand dead in Mariupol,

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.587
as it appears unfortunately,

00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:11.910
in the 3 million Ukrainians deported,

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:13.470
including a quarter million children,

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.330
at least who were to
be forcibly assimilated

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:17.970
into Russian culture in
the systematic campaign

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.910
of rape and the murder of local elites

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:24.360
in the territories that Russia controls

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.440
and maybe more banally, but I
think also very importantly,

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.810
in the systematic attempt to
destroy publishing houses,

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:34.470
libraries, and archives,
which are the way, of course,

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:37.710
that nations or societies or
people remember themselves.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:40.920
So there is a genocidal
aspect to this war,

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.560
and I want you to keep
this in mind as a theme

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.330
because this concept of genocide,

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:47.250
though it's a modern concept,

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.420
it also points us backwards
towards other questions,

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.295
which we're gonna be thinking about,

00:43:53.295 --> 00:43:55.440
which have to do with colonialism

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.960
and which have to do
with why people recognize

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.870
or do not recognize other people.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:02.640
Why, what were the,

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.023
if we're gonna ask the positive question,

00:44:06.023 --> 00:44:08.970
a Ukrainian nation exists how?

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:10.650
Which I think is a really
interesting question,

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:13.200
not just about Ukraine, a
Ukrainian nation exists.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.330
How was that possible?

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:18.120
The converse question
is what were the things

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.780
which were thrown up
along the way and why?

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:26.070
So why was there particularly
Ukrainian famine in 1933

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:28.020
in the Soviet Union?

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.220
Why that?

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:32.160
Why did Hitler particularly
think that Ukraine

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.460
would be a good site of Lebensraum?

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:40.230
Why in the 1970s were
Brezhnevian assimilation policies

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:43.530
particularly applied to Ukraine, right?

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:46.710
What is it about this place
which has put it at the center

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:50.040
of so much colonial
pressure over the centuries

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.510
and the decades?

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.220
I don't want you to
apply the word genocide

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.900
to things that happened
before there's a nation.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:55.920
That's not my point.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.130
My point though is that I want
to introduce some concepts,

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.400
which are what is
history? What is a nation?

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.220
And then the kind of
pendant or counterpart

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.380
to what is a nation, is what is genocide?

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.510
What are the things which lead to nation?

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:11.700
If there are things that
lead to nation destruction,

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.890
what are the things which,
sorry, to nation creation,

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:16.110
what are the things that
lead to nation destruction?

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:17.490
What are the deeper impulses?

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:19.260
Not just a war which is happening now

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.970
or a famine which happened then,

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:22.770
or a terror which
happened some other time,

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.510
but what are some of the deeper forces

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:25.830
which push us in that direction?

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.920
So it's, Ukraine is a heart of darkness

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.820
in that sense, right?

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.390
It's a way to collect those
kinds of events as well.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.400
They're not the only things
we're gonna be talking about,

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.650
but the concept of genocide
can help us to remember

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:39.060
that this is an important
part of the history

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.040
that we're gonna be investigating.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.990
Okay. So much for introductions.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.340
Thank you all for being here,

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.473
and I hope to see you again next week.

00:45:48.046 --> 00:45:50.963
(class applauding)

00:45:55.158 --> 00:45:58.658
(upbeat transition tones)

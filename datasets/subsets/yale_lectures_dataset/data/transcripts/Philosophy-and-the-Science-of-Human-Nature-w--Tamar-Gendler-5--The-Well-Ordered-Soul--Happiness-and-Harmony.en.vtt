00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.310
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.050
So the clicker question that
I want to ask you right now

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.580
is--ah, shoot!

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.540
This says polling closed.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.560
Now polling open.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.770
"Did you commit to turning
off the internet

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.660
completely?", press one.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.160
"Did you commit to restricting
your internet usage in some

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.170
way?" That is, you're keeping
the internet on, but you're

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.445
promising not to check Facebook,
or play Angry Birds,

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:28.600
or go shopping at Zappos, or
whatever other indulgent thing

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.580
you do on the internet.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.710
If that's your case,
press two.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.360
"Did you put no restriction on
your in-class internet use,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.420
but you're somebody with a
computer?" If so, press three.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.130
Or is it kind of not applicable
to you, because

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.760
you're somebody who uses a
pencil and paper in class?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.210
OK.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.600
Now it's supposed to be the
case that the timer is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.680
counting itself down, but no,
I've got to prattle for

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.100
twenty-eight seconds.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.050
So here we go.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.880
So this is a case--I read
through the papers for my

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.220
section, and my sense there--and
I don't know

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.870
whether it was a random
sample--is that about

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.370
two-thirds of the students
committed to totally turning

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.920
off the internet, and about a
quarter committed to sometimes

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.620
restriction, and a very small
percentage committed to no

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.340
restriction on internet use.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.660
OK.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.740
It should be the case in one
second that our slide--

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.390
yes.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.710
OK.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.840
So 43% of you, 43% of the
students in this room, made a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.620
precommitment in the
form of a promise.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.420
It became a precommitment
because you wrote it down.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.620
Just thinking it didn't
make a precommitment.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.160
But you took an action at a time
when you felt yourself to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.106
be cool and calm and reasonable,
and made a

00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:49.400
decision at that moment that
you took to be binding upon

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.230
yourself in the future.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.290
And an additional 16% of you
didn't draw a bright line at

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.790
the turning off internet
completely, but attempted to

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.080
put in place some sort of
intermediate restriction.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.020
Now my next question for you is
whether you have strayed.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.960
Twenty seconds. "One.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.370
Not even an itty bitty bit.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.030
Not once." "Two.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.130
Just once or twice." "Three.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.637
Um, well, a few times, but I'm
trying." Or "four, yep, I've

00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:29.340
been playing Sparkle HD Lite
on my iPad all class long."

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.060
And let's see how the
numbers came out.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.940
OK.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.060
So we should get--that didn't
show up automatically.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.924
Aha.

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:40.027
So 56% of you--

00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:41.160
excellent.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.665
56% of you have not
strayed at all.

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:49.920
But notice that half of you have
found ourselves unable to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.830
carry through with a commitment
that you made, and

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.760
that you provided some
enforcement for in the sense

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.630
that you internalized in your
conscience the idea that you

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.624
had made a commitment.

00:03:05.624 --> 00:03:09.800
It turns out that for many
people, simply making a

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.860
commitment in their mind is
insufficient for them to stay

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.920
in this not even an itty
bitty bit category.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.093
For those people, who end up
here or here or even here, it

00:03:27.093 --> 00:03:29.880
turns out that putting some sort
of external constraints

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.130
in place are useful.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.240
So the New York Times had
a piece last week about

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.678
something called Phone Condom,
whose slogan is "Zip it, lock

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:45.480
it, keep it in your pocket." And
the idea is that you take

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.470
your cell phone, and you put it
in this little Ziploc bag,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.910
and while you're driving,
you are unable to

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.560
gain access to it.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.440
One of the students in this
class--and you'll have access

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.930
to this on the slide--e-mailed
me a link to a computer

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.640
program which is basically a
computer condom, a "zip it,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.470
lock it, keep it in your pocket"
for internet access.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.385
It turns off access to
the internet for a

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:15.201
given period of time.

00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:18.420
But for those of you who feel
like you want some sort of

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.830
external reinforcement, but
you're not prepared to make

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.050
use of the internet lockup, I
thought I'd provide something

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.690
which would help you stick to
your commitment by making use

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.320
of two things that we learned
about last week.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.425
One is that when there are eyes
in front of you, you feel

00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:45.760
the gaze of the world
upon you.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.230
And the other is that when
there's a kind of social

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.410
reinforcement by peers, it's
easier to stick with a plan.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.730
So not only because they are
left over from my older son's

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.040
bar mitzvah, I have for you
smiley face stickers, which

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.680
the TFs will hand out.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.724
And if you would like, you are
free to put a red or orange

00:05:08.724 --> 00:05:11.390
sticker on the corner of your
computer if you're committed

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.970
to no internet during class.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.996
It'll be there to remind you
and to show your peers.

00:05:15.996 --> 00:05:19.440
And a green or blue sticker on
your computer if you are

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.680
committed to restricted
internet during class.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.840
To the TFs, there are 720 of
these stickers, so we're not

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.400
going to run out.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.416
You can just hand out--

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:31.150
just hand them out, a little
piece of them, and people can

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.780
pass them around, and put
them there or not.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.860
We're no worse off.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.410
They were sitting on my desk
since the bar mitzvah, which

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.750
was in October, and I thought,
here, we can make four points

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.020
at once in a class.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.680
In fact, we can make five.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.040
Because the question of
self-regulation is, in fact,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.490
the fundamental question that
we are addressing in the

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.060
context of the material that
we read for today.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.200
So I want to apologize, because
today's lecture really

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.870
is, in lots of ways, dead
guys on Tuesday.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.560
I'm going to go through, in some
detail, some arguments

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.180
from Plato, and then in
some detail, some

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.760
arguments from Aristotle.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.810
But my hope is that by doing
so, I'll provide you with a

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.270
framework that will allow you,
when you go back to the

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.570
reading, perhaps in the context
of writing your

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:27.060
papers, to feel like those texts
have become accessible.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.620
So famously, as you recall,
Plato had suggested that our

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.560
soul can be understood as
having three parts.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.860
That we have a rational part,
which he represents sometimes

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.220
as a human being, sometimes
as a charioteer.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.180
That we have one called the
spirited part, which he

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.020
represents sometimes as
a cooperative horse,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.640
sometimes as a lion.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.930
And that we have, in addition,
an appetitive part, which he

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.770
represents sometimes as a wild
horse, and sometimes as a

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.770
multiheaded beast.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:08.680
Plato's suggestion is that a
certain kind of happiness is

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.390
available to us if we get
these parts into line.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.480
He writes, "one is just who
does not allow the various

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.170
parts within him to meddle
with each other.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.165
He regulates well what is his
own, and rules himself, puts

00:07:25.165 --> 00:07:29.330
himself in order, and harmonizes
the three parts of

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.126
himself like three limiting
notes on a musical scale.

00:07:33.126 --> 00:07:36.985
And from having been many
things"-- from having been as

00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:41.070
you are, pulled in two
directions, pulled in the

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.040
direction of keeping the
internet off, and pulled in

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.980
the direction of checking
your Facebook page.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.960
Pulled in the direction of going
to the library and doing

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.790
your homework, and pulled in the
direction of hanging out

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.180
your suite and talking
to your suitemate.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.350
"From having been many
things"--pulled in the

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.870
direction of what reason tells
you to do, and pulled in the

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.650
direction of what spirit or
appetite tells you to do--"you

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:11.120
become entirely one, moderate
and harmonious."

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.740
So the Platonic ideal of the
well-structured soul is one

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:23.380
regulated by reason in which
spirit and appetite are

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.790
subjected to reason's
mandates.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.200
Now, what I want to
give you now is

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.280
basically a thirty second--

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.410
well, five minute--

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:39.930
overview of the plot of Plato's
Republic in Books,

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.780
(sort of), II, III,
IV, and IX.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.620
OK?

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.765
So the story goes as follows.

00:08:45.765 --> 00:08:50.230
Plato is trying to tell us what
the human soul is like.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.850
And in honor of the weather,
we'll represent the human

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.212
being like this.

00:08:55.212 --> 00:08:58.710
And he points out, as I just
noted, that the human soul has

00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.800
three parts.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.120
It's got a rational part, it's
got a spirited in part, and

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.200
it's got a part that is full
of appetite, appetitive.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.360
And you can see the human
being, the lion, and the

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.230
multiheaded beast, in Plato's
famous image there.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.940
But in order to understand what
is good for the human

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.730
being, Socrates suggests, at the
end of the discussion in

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.345
book two, which we read for last
class, that the best way

00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:33.540
to understand what it is that's
good for the tripartite

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.910
human being is to think about
what would be good for a city

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.700
that is structured
in the same way.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.950
What societal structures can
help us understand things

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.666
about the internal structures
of human beings?

00:09:49.666 --> 00:09:56.510
So he proposes the famous
city-state analogy, whereby

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.850
corresponding to the part of
the soul that he calls

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:07.300
appetite are citizens of the
city that he calls workers, or

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.090
people who do the day-to-day
work of the city, and who take

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:17.290
their joy and pleasure from the
pleasures of the body and

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.960
of the appetite.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:26.300
There are soldiers, those who
defend the city and serve as

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.700
its defenders in military
context, that who are

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.740
motivated by honor.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:39.480
And there are, in addition,
philosophers or guardians,

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.990
those who live the
life of the mind.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.000
And you'll notice who
gets to end up at

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.844
the top in this story.

00:10:47.844 --> 00:10:53.490
So the idea is that in order
to understand the four

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:59.240
cardinal virtues in the context
of the individual, we

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.525
will be helped by thinking about
where those virtues can

00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:07.360
be found in the city.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.510
And we can then map what it
is that we've learned from

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.450
looking at the problem
writ large in

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.600
the context of society.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.820
We can map that onto what
would be the case in the

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.800
context of the problem writ
small, the individual.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.280
So Plato's Socrates points out
that there are four cardinal

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.940
virtues, and you know these
from your reading.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.850
The first of these is wisdom.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.720
And the wisdom of the city and
of the individual is to be

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.070
found in its rational part.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:43.340
OK.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.590
Those should be--

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.620
There is courage.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.050
And the courage of a city or
of an individual is to be

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.030
found in its spirited parts.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.540
They're dancing.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.400
And there are two virtues--the
distinction between which is

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.250
important in some contexts, but
not for ours--and those

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.710
are the virtues of moderation
and justice.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.300
And the suggestion here is
that just as a city is

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.360
moderate and just when the
relations among the people in

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.430
it are proper, so, too, is an
individual moderate or just

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:32.060
when the relations among
its part are

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.720
appropriate and proper.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.620
That is, moderation and justice
involve a certain kind

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:43.100
of harmony among the parts.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.190
So that's the Platonic
picture.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:51.930
And it turns out that this
is Plato's answer--

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.200
Plato's answer in the
voice of Socrates--

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.950
to the challenge that Glaucon
posed to us in

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.040
middle of book two.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.620
You remember that we were given,
at the beginning of

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.970
book two, a three-way
distinction among goods.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.720
We were told that there were
things that are valuable

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.230
intrinsically, in themselves.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.620
There are things that are
valuable instrumentally, for

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.300
the goods that they provide
beyond themselves.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.900
Those are things like money,
which have no intrinsic value,

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.660
but which have instrumental
worth.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.980
And that there are things
that are valuable both

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.240
intrinsically and
instrumentally.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:38.620
And you recall that Glaucon's
argument, first with the claim

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.205
that when we talk about justice,
we make claims for

00:13:42.205 --> 00:13:46.870
its benefit in terms of the
goods that it provides in

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.150
reputation.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:52.140
Second in his Ring of Gyges
story, where he argued that if

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.570
we can get away with acting
unjustly, we should do so.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:59.100
And third, in the story of
what's called the statues

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.800
scrubbed, or the inverted
story, that even if you

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.060
weren't convinced by the Gyges
story, surely if justice

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.610
produced a bad reputation, and
injustice a good one, that you

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.040
would want to act unjustly.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:19.330
So those three arguments are
Glaucon's arguments in favor

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:25.110
of justice being something with
only instrumental value.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:31.906
On his picture, justice is
something that is of utility

00:14:31.906 --> 00:14:35.930
to us in a way that money
is of utility to us.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:41.860
It can help us buy our way into
things that themselves

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.072
have intrinsic value.

00:14:45.072 --> 00:14:49.270
Socrates' argument, by contrast,
is that justice is

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:53.020
something with both of these
characteristics.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.360
No doubt it is of instrumental
utility.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.850
He doesn't deny either Glaucon's
arguments or

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.790
Adeimantus's arguments about
the ways in which being

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:08.660
perceived as just can
be of use to us.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.390
But in addition, he argues
that there is a certain

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:17.160
intrinsic worth associated
with having one's soul

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.160
structured in the way that
the just soul is.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.720
Now, I want to point out to you,
to be fair to Glaucon and

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.320
Adeimantus, that there's
a bit of a cheat here.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.490
Glaucon and Adeimantus
are working with an

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.880
under-theorized notion
of justice.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.430
The picture that they have is
that justice is roughly acting

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.830
in conformity with the
regulations that society

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.220
imposes upon us as
considered to be

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.700
meritorious, loosely speaking.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.970
Being just is roughly
doing what the laws

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.532
say you should do.

00:15:52.532 --> 00:15:56.490
Socrates, by contrast, goes on
and gives us a much more

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.420
sophisticated account
of justice.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.330
But if those two
characterizations are what

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:07.840
philosophers sometimes like to
call extensionally equivalent,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.870
then Socrates isn't cheating.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.944
What it is to be extensionally
equivalent, is that you pick

00:16:13.944 --> 00:16:17.650
out the same set of actions
in the world.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.390
So Socrates' claim is that
it's a law that you're

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:24.635
supposed to be honest and
not murder people.

00:16:24.635 --> 00:16:27.490
But it's also the case that
somebody with a soul

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.900
structured in the way that he
has called "just" will not

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.390
steal, and not murder people.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:39.840
It's a norm of justice that one
will have piety towards

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.845
one's parents.

00:16:40.845 --> 00:16:43.952
A norm of justice in the
conventional sense.

00:16:43.952 --> 00:16:47.365
So, too, says Socrates, is it a
norm of justice in the sense

00:16:47.365 --> 00:16:49.610
that he's characterized
that you will have

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.590
piety for one's parents.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.510
And so on.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:58.720
So the picture is that the
notion, the more filled-out

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.390
notion of justice that Socrates
has provided us with,

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:05.940
accords well enough with the
notion of justice that Glaucon

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.580
and Adeimantus were interested
in to make this not cheating.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:15.520
And that allows Socrates to make
two kinds of arguments in

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.290
favor of the intrinsic
values of justice.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:24.030
The first comes at the end of
book four, where he argues

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:28.230
that justice is a
kind of health.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:33.550
Roughly, justice is to the soul
as health is to the body.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:37.700
A healthy body is one whose
parts are doing what their

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.320
parts are supposed to do.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.810
Your body is healthy if your
heart is pumping blood at the

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:46.420
right sort of pace, so that
your brain is getting the

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.950
amount of oxygen that it needs,
and your fingertips are

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:53.770
getting the amount of blood
that they need, and so on.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:59.610
So just as health is of both
intrinsic and instrumental

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:06.175
value to us in the body, so, too
is justice, which is the

00:18:06.175 --> 00:18:11.120
health of the soul, of both
intrinsic and instrumental

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:17.750
value to us as spiritual in
addition to physical beings.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:22.510
We're spiritual here in
a very modest sense.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.790
So that's the first argument.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:29.230
The first argument is an idea
that presupposes that there's

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.800
a way that it's good
for people to work.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.740
And we'll revisit this
in the context of our

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.640
discussion of Aristotle.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.150
So there's a way that your body
is supposed to work: The

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.060
heart is supposed to do this,
the lungs are supposed to do

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.000
this, you knees are supposed
to do this, your ears are

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.185
supposed to do that,
and so on.

00:18:44.185 --> 00:18:47.010
And we have a picture of
what health amounts to.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:51.240
So, too, says Plato, the
excavation project that he's

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.930
engaged in thinking about the
city-state analogy brings out

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.545
what it would be for a soul to
be healthy, and it turns out

00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:05.070
that health for the soul is to
be arranged in the way that

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.950
justice mandates.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.230
So that's the first argument
that he offers.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.791
It's an argument through
something that Glaucon and

00:19:12.791 --> 00:19:16.900
Adeimantus have conceded to
have intrinsic as well as

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.400
instrumental utility, and a
claim that once you understand

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.630
what justice is, you can see the
direct analogy between the

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:29.210
soul and justice and the
body and health.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:33.820
The second pair of arguments
occurs in book nine, and

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.915
concern the question
of happiness.

00:19:37.915 --> 00:19:41.790
The first argument there is an
argument that we'll actually

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.840
hear again when we read John
Stuart Mill at the beginning

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.778
of our utilitarianism section.

00:19:47.778 --> 00:19:51.130
And that's an argument which
runs as follows.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:54.320
The person who has developed
the capacity for

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.750
self-regulation, the self-ruler,
has along the way,

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:06.055
because of the kinds of beings
we are, also experienced all

00:20:06.055 --> 00:20:10.400
of the other kinds
of pleasure.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.180
In some ways, this is like
the Freudian story.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.470
We start off as a bundle of
desires, and we take the

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.220
things that we want, without
consideration of their

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.580
long-term consequences for us.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:27.800
And over time, we come and get
that unregulated bundle of

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.235
needs into a certain
kind of order.

00:20:30.235 --> 00:20:34.820
We regulate it first by means
of praise and blame, roughly

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.230
making use of the honor part
of ourselves, and then we

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.520
regulate it by means
of reflection and

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.290
self-understanding.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:46.430
So the person who has gotten
their soul into a harmonious

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:51.881
state is in a subjectively
excellent position, because he

00:20:51.881 --> 00:20:56.900
or she has experienced all of
the pleasures that the person

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:02.280
who doesn't do self-regulation
has experienced, and in

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.860
addition, has experienced the
kinds of pleasures that are

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.720
available to us only if our
soul is well-ordered.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.320
So all of us have experienced
the pleasure of checking

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.010
Facebook and playing Tetris.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:23.340
But only some of us have
experienced the pleasure of

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.100
turning off our Internet during
class, and leaving it

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.090
off and listening to
what it is that's

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.930
being said by our professor.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.040
And those of us who have had
the great pleasure of doing

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:43.820
the second, says Plato, have
recognized that that pleasure

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.190
is a greater form of
pleasure than the

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.360
pleasure of Angry Birds.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.400
I'll leave it to those of you
who have experienced both to

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.276
assess that argument.

00:21:55.276 --> 00:21:57.650
That's the first argument that
he makes in book nine.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.050
The second argument is actually
a very interesting

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.870
argument, and one for which
full understanding would

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.880
require my going through the
allegory of the cave, which

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.560
I'm not going to do right now.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.350
But suffice to say that it is
part of the Republic, and part

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:17.190
of Plato's philosophy in
general, to say that the kinds

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.920
of earthly pleasures that we
experience in interacting with

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.336
objects are, in fact, a certain

00:22:23.336 --> 00:22:25.540
kind of unreal pleasure.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:30.270
They aren't interacting with
that which is most real.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:34.620
What is most real, says Plato,
are not the approximations of

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.340
circles that we encounter when
we use the PowerPoint Draw

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.170
program to make the snowman
in the slide.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:46.260
They are the mathematical
ideals of circles.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:54.100
The true nature of wisdom, for
example, is not the wisdom

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.590
that we encounter in the
individuals around us, so

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:01.300
that's wonderful, but rather the
form of wisdom, of which

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.370
all of these instances
are simply imitation.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:09.660
So, too, with every other
pleasure that we have. So

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.160
there's the earthly pleasures,
and then there's a domain of

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.650
things with which we
interact which lies

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.090
beyond the earthly realm.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:25.050
I spend a lot of times watching
children's movies,

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.980
being the parent
of two of them.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.640
And among the movies that I've
seen recently with my younger

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.120
child is Narnia.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.510
And among the movies that I've
seen recently with my older

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.650
child is Infection.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:41.570
And we've also watched The
Matrix, and we've also watched

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.270
The Truman Show.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:49.740
All of these are movies that
make Plato's point.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:55.300
The gambit in each of these
films is that the reality

00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:00.860
which you take to be genuine
and most profound--

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.770
this earthly realm, in the case
of Narnia, the experience

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.930
that you're having right now, in
the case of The Matrix, and

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:13.830
so on, is, in fact, but a shadow
of that which truly

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.794
lies beyond.

00:24:16.794 --> 00:24:22.660
And this theme is, in fact, a
central theme of almost every

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.040
religious tradition.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.530
That the domain of the secular,
the domain of the

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:32.555
mundane, the domain of the
worldly, is in some sense

00:24:32.555 --> 00:24:36.140
unreal, and there is, in
addition, a domain of the

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:41.160
beyond, interaction with which
provides a kind of good that

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.710
is so immeasurably better than
the good of interacting with

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:50.590
the world, that there's almost
no comparison between them.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:56.090
And Plato's Socrates, when he
says, the person with the

00:24:56.090 --> 00:25:01.690
well-regulated soul spends his
or her time contemplating the

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:06.000
form is making exactly the same
kind of claim that, for

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.200
example, a religious Christian
would make in saying that in

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.500
giving up the earthly good and
focusing instead on what is

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:22.230
spiritually valuable, one gains
a kind of possibility

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.570
for flourishing that is
incomparable to that which you

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.120
can get in the earthly domain.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:34.940
So the second argument around
happiness claims not merely

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.900
that the person with the
well-regulated soul has

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:42.430
experienced all the pleasures
and felt subjectively that

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.710
this one is the best,
but, in fact, that

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.750
that person is correct.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:53.590
That the greatest form of
pleasures comes from the

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:58.910
well-regulated soul that spends
its time interacting

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:04.520
not with the mundane and
earthly, but with the ideas of

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.900
the beyond.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.930
Now, final quote.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.550
One of the ways of bringing home
the point that Socrates

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:20.140
has made is by means
of vivid imagery.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.010
We'll find throughout, in
every single one of the

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:26.640
authors that we read, that
they are trying to make

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.320
arguments that appeal to the
various parts of your soul.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.180
I just gave you a bunch of
arguments that ran through

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:38.835
reason, and now we're going to
get an image that's supposed

00:26:38.835 --> 00:26:44.750
to stick in your mind, the idea
for which Plato has just

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.882
provided argumentation.

00:26:46.882 --> 00:26:48.370
Here's how the passage goes.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.964
You read it for your
reading today.

00:26:49.964 --> 00:26:54.480
"Can it profit anyone to acquire
gold unjustly if by

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:59.938
doing so, he enslaves the best
part of himself to the most

00:26:59.938 --> 00:27:01.360
vicious?" Right?

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.080
So the top part of the
snowman to the

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.213
bottom part of the snowman.

00:27:05.213 --> 00:27:07.270
And here's the analogy.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.320
"If he got the gold by enslaving
his son or daughter

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.600
to savage or evil men, it
wouldn't profit him, no matter

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.754
how much gold he got." Right?

00:27:15.754 --> 00:27:18.846
If I tell you, you can have all
the money in the world,

00:27:18.846 --> 00:27:22.190
all you have to do is sell your
brother or sister into

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.870
slavery, I assume that that
trade-off wouldn't be

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.570
appealing to most of you, and
those of you to whom it would

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.685
be, there are actually courses
on peer relations over in the

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:35.020
psychology department.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.948
"It wouldn't profit him, no
matter how much gold he got.

00:27:37.948 --> 00:27:42.020
How, then, could he fail to be
wretched if he pitilessly

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.460
enslaves the most divine part
of himself to the most

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.030
polluted one?"

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.830
So the idea is this.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:55.575
When you steal, when you murder,
when you act in ways

00:27:55.575 --> 00:27:59.125
that let the lower part of your
soul do what the higher

00:27:59.125 --> 00:28:04.280
part of your soul tells you
shouldn't, you're exactly like

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:09.360
the person who has these
ill-gotten gains.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:14.010
Just as it's not a good way to
make money to sell your son or

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:18.450
daughter into slavery, so, too,
Socrates suggests, it's

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:23.470
not a good way to make money
to sell the higher part of

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:26.180
your soul into slavery.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:32.410
To enslave it to your passions
and to your appetites.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:38.350
Now, this idea that we can take
some of the common wisdom

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:43.710
about the nature of happiness,
but recognize that it captures

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:49.205
only part of the truth, is one
of the things, one of the many

00:28:49.205 --> 00:28:54.110
things, that's going on in the
passages from Jonathan Haidt

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:57.030
that I had you read for today.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.410
So we read two chapters
for today.

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:03.860
One was required, chapter
five, which was about

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.606
contemporary theories
of happiness.

00:29:05.606 --> 00:29:08.690
The second, which I recommend
to you was the

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:09.820
chapter about virtues.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.050
I want to talk about the first
of those chapters, the

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.240
happiness chapter.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.750
So we just heard that Plato
points out, or argues, or

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:22.320
contends, through this long
book, that human flourishing

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.490
comes not from material wealth
and physical goods, but rather

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.210
from something that it might
not occur to you was the

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:33.020
source of flourishing:
reflection and wisdom.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:36.220
And the arguments that he makes
there make use of the

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.970
resources of the tradition
of which he's a part.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.870
They're set in an ancient Greek
context, and they use

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:46.510
the argumentative tools
of philosophy.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:52.750
In a similar way, the discussion
that Jonathan Haidt

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:58.900
provides in chapter five tries
to do this that is similar to

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:03.410
Plato, colon: It tries to show
that there's some truth in

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:06.440
common pictures of what
happiness amounts to, but that

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.040
they haven't gotten the
whole story right.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.000
And it does so in part by using
the strategy which I

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.695
described to you earlier.

00:30:14.695 --> 00:30:17.720
It takes what the common
picture looks like, it

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.130
provides a more profound
analysis of it, and it shows

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.674
that those pick out roughly
the same class of things.

00:30:24.674 --> 00:30:30.490
And Haidt, in particular, in
that chapter, presents us with

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:35.020
two claims. The first
is one that he calls

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.780
the progress principle.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:42.910
The discovery--for which there
seems to be pretty good both

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:47.000
behavioral and neuroscientific
evidence, both within the

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.645
domain of American culture and
cross-culturally--that most of

00:30:50.645 --> 00:30:55.110
our pleasure comes not from
the achievement of a goal,

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:58.090
though there is some pleasure
that comes from that, but from

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:04.025
the process of achieving
that goal.

00:31:04.025 --> 00:31:07.690
And the second--which hearkens
back to the material that we

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:11.860
read last week from Daniel
Kahneman, and the day before

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:16.730
that from Jonathan Evans--that
because we are more sensitive

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:23.820
to changes in good than to
absolute levels of good, more

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:28.880
of something doesn't always
make us happier.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:36.060
More of something tends to make
us used to that something

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:41.230
and desirous of the change which
comes with having even

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:42.990
more of that.

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:46.093
The next slide is going to ask
you to have your clickers, so

00:31:46.093 --> 00:31:47.990
if you can take them out,
we'll turn to them.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:49.492
It's not an interesting
slide, I just ask you

00:31:49.492 --> 00:31:51.060
to have your clickers.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.260
So this gives rise to something
which is sometimes

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.970
called the hedonic treadmill.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:32:00.030
The hedonic treadmill is the
idea that in order to maintain

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:04.145
the same amount of happiness,
if it's based on material

00:32:04.145 --> 00:32:10.072
goods, requires us to run to
stay in the same place.

00:32:10.072 --> 00:32:14.420
And the psychological principles
which underlie the

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:20.120
adaptation principle are exactly
the principles that

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:25.030
governed the cases that Kahneman
was describing.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:29.090
That we are, as he showed in the
visual system, enormously

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:32.310
sensitive to contrast,
and extremely

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:35.620
bad at absolute judgment.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.270
And we'll come back to that
principle when we read the

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:43.440
Cass Sunstein paper in the
section in ethics.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.160
OK.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.360
So my question, polling is open,
is "Are you ready to

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.880
move on?" Press one if: "Yes,
I can't wait for Aristotle."

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.420
Press two if: "No, you have
a question about Plato or

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.930
Haidt."

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:55.610
OK.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.330
So this is just to like
re-engage you in case you

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.680
zoned out, because I've been
jabbering, and the clickers

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.895
are supposed to keep
you talking.

00:33:00.895 --> 00:33:01.190
OK.

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.980
We have--

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.950
oh, shoot.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:05.939
This clock was supposed to
start automatically; we

00:33:05.939 --> 00:33:07.360
already have 118 of you.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:07.980
OK.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.030
So if you are somebody--

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:12.590
can we jump this, or not?

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.910
Oh!

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:14.230
That was worse.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.780
OK.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.900
I'm not going to touch this.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.510
So if you are somebody who was
in category two, and you have

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.571
a question about Plato or Haidt
that you would like to

00:33:20.571 --> 00:33:23.470
ask now, please do it before
we discover how

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.810
rare a being you are.

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:28.920
Or perhaps how common.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.170
All right.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.500
No questions?

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.453
Question.

00:33:34.453 --> 00:33:37.770
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.845
PROFESSOR: You don't really
understand extensional

00:33:39.845 --> 00:33:40.170
equivalents.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:40.760
Yes.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.614
OK.

00:33:41.614 --> 00:33:43.520
So that is a philosopher's
term.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.360
Let's see how rare you
are, and then I'll--

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.562
ah, OK.

00:33:46.562 --> 00:33:49.790
So though you are in the 9%, I
will nonetheless answer your

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.250
question for you.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:57.832
So two characterizations are
extensionally equivalent if

00:33:57.832 --> 00:34:01.090
they pick out the same set
of things in the world.

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:06.730
So if I say: I'm interested in
picking out all geometrical

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:12.370
figures that have four corners
that are equally spaced from

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:16.520
one another, and you say, I'm
interested in picking out all

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:21.060
geometrical figures that have
four sides that are of equal

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:25.465
length and at right angles to
one another, you're picking

00:34:25.465 --> 00:34:29.820
out squares and I'm picking out
squares, even though we

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.080
gave different descriptions
of what we're picking out.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.220
If I'm picking out all female
siblings, and you're picking

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:42.090
out all sisters, we're picking
out the same class of things,

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.570
even though we're using
different descriptions.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:46.300
OK.

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.396
So it's a democracy.

00:34:49.396 --> 00:34:52.140
Plato doesn't think that's the
best form of government, but

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:52.755
here we are.

00:34:52.755 --> 00:34:54.980
We're going to move on.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.970
All right.

00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:57.056
Aristotle.

00:34:57.056 --> 00:34:59.340
So at the very least, right,
you're taking a philosophy

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.850
class, you deserve to have this
picture explained to you.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:06.111
Since you see it on every poster
on campus. "Come to the

00:35:06.111 --> 00:35:08.260
writing center!" I don't know
why they put Plato and

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.845
Aristotle on the "Come to the
writing center," but I might

00:35:10.845 --> 00:35:13.384
as well tell you what's going
on in this picture.

00:35:13.384 --> 00:35:17.045
So this picture is a famous
painting by the great

00:35:17.045 --> 00:35:18.780
Renaissance painter, Raphael.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.575
It's called The School
of Athens.

00:35:20.575 --> 00:35:23.370
Many of the figures within
the larger painting

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.930
represent his friends.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.960
You can go and see this in the
Vatican, if you're interested.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.970
In the center of that painting,
famously, are Plato,

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:35.580
standing right here,
and Aristotle,

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.930
standing right here.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:40.810
Plato is holding in his hand,
you can almost read it, a book

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:45.070
called the Timaeus, which is a
book of cosmology, and he's

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:49.500
pointing upward, many say
because he's pointing to the

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.050
realm of the forms.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.000
Aristotle, by contrast, is
holding in his hand the

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.940
Ethics, the book that we're
reading, right?

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.300
The Nicomachean Ethics,
there it is.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.416
You have a book that's on
the wall of the Vatican.

00:36:03.416 --> 00:36:04.200
That's so exciting.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.477
You have a $6 paperback
copy, but still.

00:36:07.477 --> 00:36:09.473
You have, in some
ways, the book.

00:36:09.473 --> 00:36:13.890
And Aristotle's hand is here
for one of two reasons.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.780
Either because he's pointing to
the earthly domain as part

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:21.202
of his denial of the Platonic
picture of forms, or because

00:36:21.202 --> 00:36:24.940
he's talking about the doctrine
of the mean, about

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.430
which all of you know a great
deal, because it's what we

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.090
read for today.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:29.490
OK.

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:33.087
So next time you see this
picture, at least you'll know

00:36:33.087 --> 00:36:37.520
who these two characters are:
Plato and Aristotle.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.034
Aristotle, as you know, was
a student of Plato's.

00:36:41.034 --> 00:36:45.460
And the text that we read for
today is, to my mind, one of

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.260
the most profound works of
psychology written in the last

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.060
2500 years.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.760
It is, however, miserably
difficult to read, in part

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.010
because, though Aristotle wrote
dialogues, most of those

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:01.010
dialogues were lost. And what
we have here are basically

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:02.590
Aristotle's lecture notes.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:05.530
You notice that on one of the
pages he says, "and now we'll

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:07.473
go and look at the
chart." Right?

00:37:07.473 --> 00:37:09.380
He had--like--some papyrus
version of

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.675
these PowerPoint slides.

00:37:10.675 --> 00:37:12.906
I don't know if they were
animated with--like--people

00:37:12.906 --> 00:37:14.154
who walked back and forth.

00:37:14.154 --> 00:37:18.640
But what we have here are
notes of a kind that are

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.370
rather difficult to read.

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:24.170
So because this is, in many
ways, my favorite book in the

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:27.830
whole world, much of what's
going to go on in the next

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.165
slide is that I'm just going to
give you some quotes from

00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:34.410
it, and tell you what's
going on in the text.

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.306
So this is Aristotle's Ethics.

00:37:36.306 --> 00:37:38.379
If Plato is thirty seconds,
this is going to

00:37:38.379 --> 00:37:39.762
take sixty or so.

00:37:39.762 --> 00:37:43.054
Let me tell you what's
going on.

00:37:43.054 --> 00:37:46.250
So the discussion that we read
starts at the beginning of

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:49.570
book one, with an argument
that's sometimes called, the

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:53.960
argument in favor of the summum
bonum --you don't have

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.040
to write it down, which is why
I didn't put it on the

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.066
slide--sometimes called
the highest good.

00:37:59.066 --> 00:38:00.750
That which is pursued
for its own sake.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:03.480
And the argument here is
basically what we might call a

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.760
regress argument.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.250
It's like the intrinsic/
instrumental value argument

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:09.960
that we heard in Plato.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.885
The idea is that every good,
that is, everything that you

00:38:13.885 --> 00:38:17.730
seek, is pursued either for
itself, or for the sake of

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:18.790
something else.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:21.457
And if it's pursued for the
sake of something else, it

00:38:21.457 --> 00:38:24.730
must bottom out or talk up.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.910
Summum bonum, the
highest good, it

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:29.690
must top up in something.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:33.510
And so the inquiry that we
engage in when we do what

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.090
Aristotle calls political
science--which is not

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.260
political science like in the
Poli Sci department--it's

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:43.360
political science in the sense
of the study of human beings

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.510
as political, that is,
social animals.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:51.070
So the study of ourselves as
socially embedded creatures is

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:55.900
the study of what is the highest
good for the human.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.970
And the highest good for the
human being, says Aristotle,

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:04.010
is--both in the minds of the
common man, that is, both in

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:07.910
sort of what you would read in
the equivalent of the mass

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:12.530
media in ancient Greece,
and in the mind of the

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:17.730
educated--what was called
eudaemonia or flourishing,

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.950
sometimes translated
as happiness.

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:24.170
That's what everybody
is going for.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:27.310
So that's the beginning of
the passages that we

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:28.136
read from book one.

00:39:28.136 --> 00:39:29.830
There's the question,
what's the thing

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:30.690
that everybody's after?

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.756
And the answer is, everybody's
after the same thing.

00:39:33.756 --> 00:39:37.070
They're after happiness,
flourishing, eudaimonia.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.850
So the next question is this.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:40.710
What sort of happiness?

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:45.564
What is it that we mean when we
set out to seek happiness?

00:39:45.564 --> 00:39:48.640
And here Aristotle runs through
this inventory of

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.590
answers that have
been provided.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:54.380
And you'll notice, good student
that he is of Plato's,

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:58.460
that this taxonomy here is going
to look pretty familiar.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:02.130
If it's the pleasures of
gratification, that is, the

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:03.190
pleasures that Plato
would call the

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:04.380
pleasures of appetite?

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.820
"No," says Aristotle, and he
gives some reasons for that.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.430
Is it the pleasures of honor,
what Plato would call the

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:11.720
pleasures of spirit?

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:15.420
"No," says Aristotle, and he
gives some reasons for it.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.980
Is it, then, the pleasures of
reflection, the things which

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.310
come from reason?

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:22.450
"Yes!" Says Aristotle.

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:25.340
And now he goes on to give
some reasons for it.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.870
But the reasons that he gives
for it look different from the

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:33.700
reasons that Plato gave. Because
Aristotle rejects

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:38.210
Plato's idea of the forms.
Aristotle is not looking to a

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:40.820
domain beyond to defend
his view.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.700
He's looking to a domain within
to defend his view.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:45.880
It's 11:17.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.950
I'm going to do one more slide,
and then we'll finish

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.558
up with Aristotle
next lecture.

00:40:50.558 --> 00:40:53.820
So the question is, if you can't
turn to the form as your

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.090
justification for reason--

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:57.130
remember, Plato has this
explanation: "Why

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.414
is reason so good?

00:40:58.414 --> 00:41:01.100
It lets you connect to a domain
beyond yourselves."

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.120
Aristotle can't give
that answer.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.380
What, then, makes
reason so good?

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.535
Well, here's the argument.

00:41:07.535 --> 00:41:10.180
Every object in the world,
he says, has a function.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.900
The function of a knife
is to cut well.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.970
The function of a paperweight
is to hold down papers.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:19.510
The function of a laser pointer
is to direct attention

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.993
towards the slide, and so on.

00:41:20.993 --> 00:41:25.265
And a good one of those things
is one which does

00:41:25.265 --> 00:41:29.050
its function well.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:32.910
Its function is that which set
it apart from other entities.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:36.890
So good paperweights are things
that are heavy, and bad

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:40.300
paperweights are things that are
light, or round, so that

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.660
they roll off.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.390
Or invisible, so that
you can't find them.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:47.205
Or too heavy to move, so that
you can't pick them up off

00:41:47.205 --> 00:41:48.420
your paper.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:52.490
So when something has a
function, a good version of

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:58.851
that thing has manifest in
itself that which allows that

00:41:58.851 --> 00:42:02.630
object to perform its function
especially well.

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.910
Well, what's the function
of human beings?

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.940
Well, to answer that question,
we have to answer the question

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.260
what is special about
human beings?

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.220
What distinguishes us from
plants, which take in

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.990
nutrition, and from animals,
which are capable of

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.490
locomotion and feeling
sensation?

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:22.340
What distinguishes us from
those beings is reason.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:26.040
So just as knives are great when
they cut well, humans are

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.560
great when they do that special
human thing especially

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.620
well when they reason well.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:36.125
"Reason is," he writes at 1098,
"the special function of

00:42:36.125 --> 00:42:39.370
a human being." What, then,
is the human good?

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:43.730
Well, the good for a knife
is to be most manifestly

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:45.070
knife-like, right?

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:48.340
I mean, all those magic swords
that you get in plays and

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.760
movies and books?

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.544
What makes them good swords?

00:42:51.544 --> 00:42:54.330
That they're especially able to
slay your enemies, right?

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.680
That's why the swords
are good swords.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:01.005
So what makes you the Sword of
Lancelot of human beings?

00:43:01.005 --> 00:43:05.625
It's that your soul is
structured in such a way that

00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:09.110
you do what is best and
most completely

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.040
and distinctly human.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.730
The good human being is the one
that does the human stuff

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:18.730
best of all, and the human
stuff turns out to be

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:23.960
reasoning and acting in
accord with virtue.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.220
So the question that we'll turn
to at the beginning of

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:28.550
next lecture--

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.110
and you're all in a position
to read the punchline, in

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:33.866
fact, you should have read
the punchline for today--

00:43:33.866 --> 00:43:39.660
is what does the virtue look
like that makes us distinctly

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:43.670
and most excellently human,
and how is it cultivated?

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:48.200
So for Thursday, we
are reading three

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.160
really fantastic things.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.550
We're reading selections from
The Iliad, and I've given you

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:56.950
two choices of ways
to do that.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:58.600
Pleas look at the
reading guide.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.550
You can either read all of book
one or you can look at

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.000
the context of each of the
passages that Jonathan Shay

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.050
gives us, and I've given you
instructions how to do that.

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:09.980
We're reading Jonathan Shay's
incredible book, Achilles in

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.120
Vietnam, and we're also reading
Stanley Milgram's

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:17.110
famous 1963 "Behavioral Study
of Obedience" paper.

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:20.440
So we'll start with our
Aristotle, and then we'll move

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:24.010
on to our discussions
of those three.

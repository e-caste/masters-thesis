00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.874
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Welcome back for

00:00:02.874 --> 00:00:05.415
more cosmology on a rainy day.
You'll recall,

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:08.780
maybe, what we were trying to
do.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.883
We're trying to determine the
past and future of the

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:20.340
Universe--which,
it turns out,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.213
can be summarized by a single
number, namely,

00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:25.500
the scale factor of the
Universe.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.570
It's actually not a single
number.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.440
It's actually a function. Right?
It's a function of time.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.300
The scale factor changes with
time.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.651
So, when I make this grandiose
statement that I'm going to talk

00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:44.030
about the past and future of the
Universe,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.396
what I really mean is,
I want to determine what the

00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:50.090
scale factor is as a function of
time.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.130
And so, that's just a standard
kind of a graph.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.261
Here's the scale factor,
usually given the letter

00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:58.970
a.
Function of t.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.960
Here's time.
The present is somewhere along

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.799
this graph.
Call that now.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.806
And so, here's--and the
Universe has some scale factor

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:14.089
at the present time.
And what we're going to do is

00:01:14.089 --> 00:01:17.606
we're going to call that--define
the scale factor at the present

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:20.184
time to be 1.
We're just going to--that's

00:01:20.184 --> 00:01:23.303
called normalizing:
when you set--when you multiply

00:01:23.303 --> 00:01:26.921
something by some convenient
number so that it comes out to

00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:30.959
be 1 at a convenient moment.
So, that's just a definition.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:39.345
We define the current scale
factor to be 1,

00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:44.664
to be unity.
And so, there's a point here

00:01:44.664 --> 00:01:48.090
at--right now,
the scale factor is 1.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.659
We also know what the slope of
the scale factor is,

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.300
because we measure that from
the Hubble Constant.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.480
And so, in an appropriate set
of units, the scale factor is

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.590
increasing at a rate of the
Hubble Constant,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.080
which is, I think,
2 x 10^(-18) per second.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.356
So, if the scale factor is one
right now, then one second from

00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:20.199
now, the scale factor is going
to be 1 + 2 x 10^(-18).

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.620
So, every second,
it gets 2 x 10^(-18) bigger.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.320
That's not a real large
increase and,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.842
in fact, over the entire
history of humanity,

00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:39.414
it won't increase by that much.
Let's see, in a million years,

00:02:39.414 --> 00:02:45.508
there is something like--okay,
in 10^(6) years,

00:02:45.508 --> 00:02:50.940
there are 3 x 10^(7) x 10^(6)
seconds.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:03:00.140
That's 3 x 10^(13) seconds.
Multiply that by 2 x 10^(-18)

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:11.260
and the scale factor increases
by 3 x 10^(13) x 2 x 10^(-18).

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.766
That's 6 x 10^(-5).
So, it still hasn't made a

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:18.470
whole lot difference,
even a million years from now.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.891
But, keep at it for a while,
and the scale factor is going

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:28.074
to pile up and will increase.
So, we know that it's

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.852
increasing.
And then, the question is,

00:03:30.852 --> 00:03:33.960
"Is this increase changing with
time?"

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.488
So, let's see.
If it doesn't change--if it's

00:03:38.488 --> 00:03:42.140
just a straight linear increase,
this is the situation in which

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.319
there's no matter in the
Universe.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.581
So, the Universe is not slowing
down because of gravity,

00:03:46.581 --> 00:03:47.979
because there's no matter in
it.

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:52.765
And that gets labeled with this
factor Omega [Ω]

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:56.096
being equal to 0.
Let me remind you:

00:03:56.096 --> 00:04:00.724
Ω is defined as the density of
the Universe divided by the

00:04:00.724 --> 00:04:03.770
critical density.
The critical density is how

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.650
dense it has to be to turn
around.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.770
So, another possible track for
the Universe:

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.400
we know it's expanding at a
particular rate now,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.689
but it could slow down in the
future, turn around and fall

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.939
back--could look something like
this.

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:22.949
This is the case where Ω is
greater than 1.

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.872
And then, the intermediate case
where Ω is less than 1,

00:04:26.872 --> 00:04:30.550
but not equal to 0.
It sort of does this.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.775
It falls off a little bit,
continues to expand,

00:04:32.775 --> 00:04:37.175
something like that.
And this Ω less than 1,

00:04:37.175 --> 00:04:42.270
but still greater than 0.
Okay.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.770
So, here's the goal.
We've got to figure out which

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.415
track we're on.
At the moment,

00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:48.676
we sit here,
and we measure the Hubble

00:04:48.676 --> 00:04:50.855
Constant.
So, all we know is where we are

00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:52.720
and where we're going in the
short run.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.548
And what we want to do is to
figure out which of these

00:04:55.548 --> 00:04:58.269
possibilities the Universe is
actually following.

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:00.807
And in so doing,
decide whether we're going to

00:05:00.807 --> 00:05:04.133
end up falling back together in
this Big Crunch or expanding

00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:07.328
forever.
And we talked a little bit last

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:11.470
time about a kind of direct way
of determining this,

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.018
namely, measuring Ω.
This Ω factor is the density

00:05:15.018 --> 00:05:17.720
of the Universe divided by the
critical density.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.712
You could, in principle,
go out and measure the density

00:05:20.712 --> 00:05:24.146
of the Universe.
You can compute the critical

00:05:24.146 --> 00:05:26.293
density.
You divide one by another,

00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:29.230
and you know which of these
possibilities turns out to be

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.470
true.
And that ran into trouble,

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:41.930
as you'll recall.
So, direct measurement of Ω.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.730
This leads to trouble in the
form of dark matter.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.680
So, the Universe turns out to
be full of this dark matter.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.259
If you add up all the
galaxies--the mass of all the

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.980
galaxies, including dark
matter--so,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:04.636
mass in galaxies gives you an
Ω that's less than 1,

00:06:04.636 --> 00:06:10.353
that's around 1/3 or 1/4.
But there might be--you know,

00:06:10.353 --> 00:06:12.151
now that we've already
discovered that the vast

00:06:12.151 --> 00:06:14.379
majority of matter is something
we know nothing about,

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.696
there might be more of it
between galaxies that we don't

00:06:17.696 --> 00:06:19.971
know about.
So, we want a different

00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:20.620
approach.

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:34.084
So, here's something you can do
that's really quite a different

00:06:34.084 --> 00:06:40.949
approach to this problem.
Let's draw that plot up again.

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.648
And so, here's now,
and then, there are these

00:06:43.648 --> 00:06:45.120
various possibilities.

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:54.265
And it might go like this,
or it might,

00:06:54.265 --> 00:06:58.760
you know, fall all the way back
down like that.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.358
So, here's something you can do.
Remember that you can look back

00:07:03.358 --> 00:07:05.800
into the past.
You can look into the past by

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.430
looking at very distant things.
And you see the light coming to

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.738
you from the time in the past.
So, you look into the past

00:07:13.738 --> 00:07:16.980
because of the light travel
time.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.449
And so, if now is here,
we can actually look at objects

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:29.540
which were existing at some time
in the past,

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.269
back, say, here,
I don't know--by looking at

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:35.380
things that are three billion
light years away,

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.814
or something like that.
And the question is,

00:07:37.814 --> 00:07:41.074
if you can do that--you can
figure out how far in the past

00:07:41.074 --> 00:07:43.019
it is, by the way,
that's easy.

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:55.210
Measure distance and time in
the past is just distance.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.370
Miles per hour.
Which way up is it going to be?

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.728
Divided by the speed of light.
So, if you can measure the

00:08:03.728 --> 00:08:07.135
distance to something you know
how long--how far in the past it

00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:09.442
was.
So, that tells you where it is

00:08:09.442 --> 00:08:15.454
on this axis.
So, then, all you need to do is

00:08:15.454 --> 00:08:21.889
measure the scale factor at that
time.

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:24.983
And you can see that if you
could do this,

00:08:24.983 --> 00:08:29.360
you would be able to determine
whether at some point in the

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.698
past you are here,
if the scale factor was low,

00:08:33.698 --> 00:08:36.305
or here, or here.
And therefore,

00:08:36.305 --> 00:08:39.593
if you made accurate
measurements of the scale factor

00:08:39.593 --> 00:08:43.261
in the past, you could figure
out which one of these tracks

00:08:43.261 --> 00:08:46.115
you're on.
And if you could figure that

00:08:46.115 --> 00:08:49.859
out, then you can infer,
if that track continues without

00:08:49.859 --> 00:08:52.649
some other form of physics
kicking in,

00:08:52.649 --> 00:08:55.580
you could figure out where it
will go in the future.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.309
So, you've got to be able to
determine what the scale factor

00:08:59.309 --> 00:09:03.039
was, which doesn't seem like
it's actually all that easy,

00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:05.759
but it turns out that this can
be done.

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:09.339
And the way to think about this
is you have to think about the

00:09:09.339 --> 00:09:11.570
redshift, the cosmological
redshift,

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.665
in different terms from what
we've been thinking about it so

00:09:14.665 --> 00:09:19.517
far.
So, a different view of

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:23.397
redshift.
You remember this is where we

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:25.460
started, right?
We measured the distance to

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.860
things.
We measured their velocity.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.135
We got Hubble's Law;
therefore, the Universe is

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.655
expanding.
And as we were doing that,

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:35.280
we had the idea that the
redshift is telling you

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.576
something about velocity.
So, one view is that the

00:09:40.576 --> 00:09:46.195
redshift tells you something
about velocity,

00:09:46.195 --> 00:09:52.730
and the velocities are all
moving away from us.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.899
And therefore,
the Universe is expanding.

00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:59.817
But you remember that the
cosmological redshift caused by

00:09:59.817 --> 00:10:04.032
the expansion of the
Universe--that velocity is a

00:10:04.032 --> 00:10:09.212
little different in kind from
the way we ordinarily think of

00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:12.295
velocity.
It's not--objects are not

00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:15.456
moving through space.
It's just, the space itself is

00:10:15.456 --> 00:10:17.919
expanding and that leads to some
differences.

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:19.402
For example,
in principle,

00:10:19.402 --> 00:10:22.961
the cosmological redshift can
cause things that look like the

00:10:22.961 --> 00:10:26.520
velocity is potentially greater
than the speed of light,

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:32.203
and things like that.
So, the cosmological redshift

00:10:32.203 --> 00:10:38.570
is not the same as an ordinary
velocity.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:43.419
And one way to think about what
the redshift is,

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:47.980
is the following.
So, another view.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.130
The Universe is expanding.
But a lot of the things in the

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.770
Universe are not expanding.
You're not expanding.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.419
The galaxy's not expanding.
We talked about this a little.

00:11:02.419 --> 00:11:04.990
That's because there are forces
holding it together.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.974
The Earth isn't expanding
because its gravitational force

00:11:07.974 --> 00:11:10.662
holds it together.
I'm not expanding because the

00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:14.129
chemical bonds between the atoms
in my body hold it together.

00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:16.721
The galaxy is not expanding
because gravity holds it

00:11:16.721 --> 00:11:19.832
together.
But a wavelength of light

00:11:19.832 --> 00:11:24.629
doesn't have such a force to
hold it together.

00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:28.844
So, as the Universe expands,
wavelengths of light expand

00:11:28.844 --> 00:11:33.822
along with it.
So, this is another view of

00:11:33.822 --> 00:11:41.465
where the redshift comes from:
that wavelengths of light

00:11:41.465 --> 00:11:46.190
expand along with the Universe.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:55.028
That's an interesting thought.
So, the question is,

00:11:55.028 --> 00:11:58.823
"Why do we observe light from
distant galaxies to be

00:11:58.823 --> 00:12:01.373
redshifted?"
In this interpretation,

00:12:01.373 --> 00:12:04.799
it's not because these things
are moving away from us.

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:07.788
It's because,
during the time between when

00:12:07.788 --> 00:12:11.360
that wavelength was emitted and
when we see it,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.751
the Universe has expanded and
the wavelength has expanded

00:12:14.751 --> 00:12:16.664
along with it.
And, therefore,

00:12:16.664 --> 00:12:20.631
we see a longer wavelength than
we would have from a photon that

00:12:20.631 --> 00:12:24.295
hadn't been traveling as long,
because the Universe,

00:12:24.295 --> 00:12:27.769
in that case,
wouldn't have expanded as much.

00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:31.429
Wavelengths of light expand
along with the Universe.

00:12:31.429 --> 00:12:43.310
And so, when we observe distant
objects, the wavelength we

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:52.690
observe is longer than when it
was emitted,

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.920
because the Universe has been
expanding during that time.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.756
This is--yes, go ahead.
Student: So,

00:13:01.756 --> 00:13:03.282
if the Universe is expanding as
the light is traveling,

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:04.610
by the time the light reaches
this Universe,

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:09.748
will be somewhat larger than
when--than when the light was

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:11.034
emitted?
Professor Charles

00:13:11.034 --> 00:13:12.381
Bailyn: Yeah.
Student: So,

00:13:12.381 --> 00:13:14.596
is the time--is the time that
we, you know,

00:13:14.596 --> 00:13:16.970
that we even have [inaudible]
in the past,

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.026
is that the distance divided
by--I mean, is that the original

00:13:20.026 --> 00:13:23.032
distance divided by the speed of
light or the-- Professor

00:13:23.032 --> 00:13:27.012
Charles Bailyn: Okay.
So, this is this complicated

00:13:27.012 --> 00:13:31.927
thing about, what do we mean by
distance in an expanding

00:13:31.927 --> 00:13:35.064
Universe?
And what you mean--this is a

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:39.199
good question.
What you mean by distance is

00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:42.609
how much--okay.
So, the first thing to say is

00:13:42.609 --> 00:13:45.737
that cosmologists worry about
this a lot, and there are

00:13:45.737 --> 00:13:48.750
different kinds of distances
that can be defined.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.256
There's the coordinate
distance, which doesn't change

00:13:51.256 --> 00:13:53.278
as the Universe expands.
There are other kinds of

00:13:53.278 --> 00:13:55.710
distances.
In the particular case of what

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.830
we're doing right now,
the key way you measure

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.019
distance, remember,
is the standard candle.

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:04.917
So, you define what's called
the luminosity distance,

00:14:04.917 --> 00:14:07.370
which is how much fainter
something looks.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.631
And so, basically,
distance is defined--so let

00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:13.240
me--this is kind of a
parenthesis.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.234
What do I mean by distance?
Distance is defined by this

00:14:17.234 --> 00:14:17.910
equation.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:26.176
So, what you mean by distance,
in this case,

00:14:26.176 --> 00:14:31.116
is how much fainter are the
objects you're looking at than

00:14:31.116 --> 00:14:33.679
otherwise.
And so, something that's twice

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:36.559
as far away--what does that mean
for something to be twice as far

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:38.388
away?
It means the light from a

00:14:38.388 --> 00:14:40.679
standard candle is four times
fainter.

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:43.984
And so, you define distance as
the dimming of light,

00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:47.029
because that's the way you
measure the thing.

00:14:47.029 --> 00:14:50.027
And then, you have to be
careful when you're doing this

00:14:50.027 --> 00:14:51.970
out in strict mathematical
terms.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.043
You have to be careful that
that kind--that the way you've

00:14:55.043 --> 00:14:58.223
defined, you don't get confused
about which kind of distance

00:14:58.223 --> 00:15:01.559
you're working on.
So, that defines distance.

00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:05.641
Then, time, the lookback time,
turns out to be,

00:15:05.641 --> 00:15:09.457
more or less,
certainly for short distances,

00:15:09.457 --> 00:15:13.450
correctly defined as Distance
/ c.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.649
But you do have to worry about
this when you get into large

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:21.850
cosmological distances and I
don't want to go into that,

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.765
but the different kinds of
distances are related to each

00:15:24.765 --> 00:15:27.450
other in complicated ways.
Okay.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:31.296
So, this is basically back to
the question of how you get the

00:15:31.296 --> 00:15:34.470
x-axis on that graph.
I'm now talking about the

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.120
y-axis,
the scale factor.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.779
So, then, how do you measure
the scale factor?

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:43.984
The scale factor--so,
the scale factor now,

00:15:43.984 --> 00:15:48.689
of the Universe now,
divided by the scale factor

00:15:48.689 --> 00:15:51.223
then,
when you emitted that

00:15:51.223 --> 00:15:55.970
wavelength, is going to be equal
to the observed wavelength,

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.200
divided by the wavelength of
the light when it was emitted.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.793
Because that's how much larger
the Universe has gotten,

00:16:01.793 --> 00:16:04.289
and the wavelengths have gotten
big along with it.

00:16:04.289 --> 00:16:08.918
So that's equal to
λ_emit plus Δλ,

00:16:08.918 --> 00:16:13.948
as we've defined it before,
over λ_emit,

00:16:13.948 --> 00:16:18.628
which is equal to 1 + Z.
Because the redshift,

00:16:18.628 --> 00:16:21.386
Z, remember,
is the change in the wavelength

00:16:21.386 --> 00:16:24.090
divided by the wavelength when
it was emitted.

00:16:28.169 --> 00:16:32.474
So, by measuring redshifts,
you can tell what the scale of

00:16:32.474 --> 00:16:36.853
the Universe was relative to the
scale of the Universe now,

00:16:36.853 --> 00:16:40.854
when that light was emitted.
Now, remember,

00:16:40.854 --> 00:16:45.379
I defined the scale factor now
to be 1.

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:49.852
So, that means 1 / a is
equal to 1 + Z, or the

00:16:49.852 --> 00:16:54.627
scale factor of the Universe in
units where it's currently equal

00:16:54.627 --> 00:16:59.910
to 1,
is equal to 1 / (1 + Z).

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.440
And Z, you measure.

00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:13.729
And so, in principle,
you can measure both axes of

00:17:13.729 --> 00:17:19.036
that graph.
And so, if I now go back to my

00:17:19.036 --> 00:17:25.130
plot, you could measure some
points on this plot.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.883
Now, all of them are in the
past, not the future,

00:17:27.883 --> 00:17:31.496
because you can't look into the
future by this light travel time

00:17:31.496 --> 00:17:33.878
trick.
But you could go out there and

00:17:33.878 --> 00:17:35.747
you could discover,
if you made,

00:17:35.747 --> 00:17:38.339
you know, really excellent
measurements,

00:17:38.339 --> 00:17:41.460
you could discover that there's
a point right here.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.050
That a particular galaxy,
or whatever it is you're

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:49.299
looking at, is far away such
that the time back is this.

00:17:49.299 --> 00:17:51.470
And then, you measure the
redshift.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.965
You get a scale factor.
And you could measure that at

00:17:54.965 --> 00:17:59.259
that time the Universe had such
and such a scale factor.

00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:02.336
And if you measured a whole
bunch of these things and they

00:18:02.336 --> 00:18:04.279
sort of lined up in this nice
way,

00:18:04.279 --> 00:18:09.213
then you might conclude,
well, the Universe is doing

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:14.340
this, and you might then
extrapolate to determine what

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.789
the Universe is going to do in
the future.

00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:23.358
And so, this is just the Hubble
Diagram interpreted in a

00:18:23.358 --> 00:18:27.927
slightly different way and being
looked at at a distance

00:18:27.927 --> 00:18:32.745
sufficiently far away that the
rate of expansion would have

00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:36.650
been different back then,
than it is now.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.140
So, I'm going to draw it all
again.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.130
Here's a.
Here's t.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.000
There's this.
Here's one of these.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.670
And here's this.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.593
But, you know,
that's not usually how we plot

00:18:57.593 --> 00:19:00.859
the Hubble Diagram.
What we're usually plotting,

00:19:00.859 --> 00:19:04.264
as you'll recall,
is distance versus velocity,

00:19:04.264 --> 00:19:08.200
because those are the things we
actually measure.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:14.846
Velocity is redshift, Z.
And remember that 1 / (1 +

00:19:14.846 --> 00:19:19.950
Z) = a,
or--let's see.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:27.772
1 / a = 1 + Z
a / a 1 / a

00:19:27.772 --> 00:19:32.279
1 – a / a,
yeah.

00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:36.640
1 – a / a =
Z.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.382
So, this represents the scale
factor, this axis,

00:19:40.382 --> 00:19:45.442
whereas this--what we actually,
usually, plot is m -

00:19:45.442 --> 00:19:48.145
M, which,
you'll recall,

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:52.200
is equal to 5 log (D /
10 parsecs).

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.837
And so, this scale represents
time, because distance can be

00:19:55.837 --> 00:19:58.722
converted to time,
because we know the speed of

00:19:58.722 --> 00:20:01.825
light.
So, this is a time axis in

00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:08.276
really weird units.
And this is a scale factor axis

00:20:08.276 --> 00:20:12.556
in really weird units.
But, you can,

00:20:12.556 --> 00:20:16.394
therefore, transform each of
these lines, which is scale

00:20:16.394 --> 00:20:19.882
factor versus time,
into an equivalent line on this

00:20:19.882 --> 00:20:23.164
plot.
So, the green line is the plot

00:20:23.164 --> 00:20:27.730
where the Universe just expands
and there's no mass.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:31.680
Nothing slows down.
So, it kind of looks like this.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.150
All right.
Now, what are the points?

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:44.990
This is now in the time factor,
and up here is then.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.819
Okay, so, you're going from now
to then.

00:20:46.819 --> 00:20:51.967
So, you're kind of sitting on
this point, looking back this

00:20:51.967 --> 00:20:54.978
way.
And here is scale factor

00:20:54.978 --> 00:20:58.694
a = 1,
and here's scale factor

00:20:58.694 --> 00:21:02.180
a = small.
Okay?

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.756
Because the Z is getting
bigger, therefore a is

00:21:04.756 --> 00:21:07.594
getting smaller.
So, what would the red curve

00:21:07.594 --> 00:21:11.869
look like on this plot of the
things we actually measure?

00:21:11.869 --> 00:21:16.188
Well, when it's close,
the red curve sits right on top

00:21:16.188 --> 00:21:19.784
of the green curve.
So, it kind of starts out like

00:21:19.784 --> 00:21:24.941
this, with no distinction.
Then, at a certain point in the

00:21:24.941 --> 00:21:29.780
past, let's see.
How do I want to do this?

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:36.107
Let's pick a particular time.
So, that's a particular

00:21:36.107 --> 00:21:38.920
distance.
At that time,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:46.432
the scale factor is smaller on
the red curve than it is on the

00:21:46.432 --> 00:21:50.380
green curve.
If the scale factor is smaller,

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.873
the redshift has to be bigger.
So, what's going to be

00:21:53.873 --> 00:21:56.598
happening, here,
is the red line is going to

00:21:56.598 --> 00:22:00.399
gradually diverge from the green
line in just the same way it

00:22:00.399 --> 00:22:02.996
does here,
in such a way that at a given

00:22:02.996 --> 00:22:05.950
distance--that is to say,
a given time in the past,

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.721
the redshift is bigger,
which means the scale factor is

00:22:09.721 --> 00:22:13.187
smaller.
And then, the brown curve will

00:22:13.187 --> 00:22:16.970
kind of do the same thing,
only more so.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.370
So, this is what we expect to
see.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.323
This is Ω greater than 1.
Ω less than 1,

00:22:22.323 --> 00:22:29.269
but still greater than 0.
Ω = 0.

00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:32.769
So, all the Hubble Diagrams
we've looked at so far have been

00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:35.497
down at this end,
here, where they're all lying

00:22:35.497 --> 00:22:38.551
on top of each other.
But you can imagine that if you

00:22:38.551 --> 00:22:40.630
get out to big redshifts,
redshift of 1.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.602
At a redshift of 1,
the scale factor is half of

00:22:43.602 --> 00:22:46.521
what it is today.
You're halfway back to the Big

00:22:46.521 --> 00:22:49.373
Bang in terms of scale factor.
You can imagine that these

00:22:49.373 --> 00:22:51.963
things would really look quite
different, as indeed they do in

00:22:51.963 --> 00:22:55.217
this little plot I've drawn,
when the scale factor is half

00:22:55.217 --> 00:22:58.313
of what it is today.
If the scale factor is 1% less

00:22:58.313 --> 00:23:00.626
than it is today,
you'll have a tough time

00:23:00.626 --> 00:23:04.700
telling these things apart.
So, what do you need to do?

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.539
What you want to do is measure
redshifts and distances.

00:23:07.539 --> 00:23:10.427
Plot them on this plot,
and see which of these lines

00:23:10.427 --> 00:23:13.099
turns out to be true.
What do you need to do that?

00:23:13.099 --> 00:23:16.300
What you need is a really
bright standard candle.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:28.176
Why does it need to be bright?
Because you need to be able to

00:23:28.176 --> 00:23:30.910
see it at large distances.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.976
And the thing that happened in
the 1990s, and that has

00:23:37.976 --> 00:23:41.160
transformed cosmology,
is that we are now able to make

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.670
these kinds of measurements all
the way out to a redshift of 1,

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.965
and in some cases, further.
And the particular standard

00:23:48.965 --> 00:23:54.720
candle we're looking at are the
so-called Type 1a Supernovae.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.122
I'll discuss what these are
later on, but for the moment

00:23:58.122 --> 00:24:01.710
let's just take the point that
they're standard candles,

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.390
therefore we know how bright
they are.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.164
And they're really,
really bright--absolute

00:24:06.164 --> 00:24:10.847
magnitude of something like -19.
So, they're as bright as whole

00:24:10.847 --> 00:24:13.707
galaxies.
In fact, they often outshine

00:24:13.707 --> 00:24:16.742
the galaxy they're in.
These are exploding stars and,

00:24:16.742 --> 00:24:19.357
as I say, we'll talk about the
details of exactly how these

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:22.383
things work later on.
So, Type 1a Supernovae turn out

00:24:22.383 --> 00:24:25.016
to be these really bright
standard candles,

00:24:25.016 --> 00:24:28.339
and you can make this kind of
measurement on them.

00:24:28.339 --> 00:24:33.507
I have the data here,
but it's--I have to talk about

00:24:33.507 --> 00:24:39.790
one more technical thing about
the way the data's presented.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:44.482
Let's see.
Ordinarily, the way you tend to

00:24:44.482 --> 00:24:48.517
plot these things,
as I said, is you plot redshift

00:24:48.517 --> 00:24:52.140
versus apparent minus absolute
magnitude.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:56.534
This is a quantity known as the
distance modulus,

00:24:56.534 --> 00:25:02.119
and it's related to distance by
the equation we had before.

00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:04.855
And so, then,
what you get is,

00:25:04.855 --> 00:25:07.685
you get this,
and you get this,

00:25:07.685 --> 00:25:11.553
and you get this,
as we've written it down

00:25:11.553 --> 00:25:14.788
before.
And the problem is that it's

00:25:14.788 --> 00:25:19.093
hard to tell the differences
between these lines because this

00:25:19.093 --> 00:25:21.819
is now being measured in
magnitude.

00:25:21.819 --> 00:25:25.200
The separation out here at a
redshift of 1.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.148
This is about--this interval
here, in magnitude--let me write

00:25:30.148 --> 00:25:33.365
it that way--is about--oh,
I don't know,

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:37.490
a third of a magnitude or
something like that.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.265
But this whole plot is,
you know, if you go all the way

00:25:41.265 --> 00:25:43.643
back to time 0,
this whole plot is,

00:25:43.643 --> 00:25:46.789
I don't know,
can be 10 to 20 magnitudes.

00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:50.569
And so, it's just kind of hard
to see these little differences

00:25:50.569 --> 00:25:54.129
between the things.
So, they plot it differently so

00:25:54.129 --> 00:25:57.700
that you can bring out these
slight differences.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.299
And what they do is,
they do this.

00:25:59.299 --> 00:26:03.940
They plot a quantity called Δ
(m – M).

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:08.474
What's that?
That's the difference between

00:26:08.474 --> 00:26:16.003
the measured distance modulus
and the distance modulus that

00:26:16.003 --> 00:26:23.142
you would expect at that
particular redshift in an empty

00:26:23.142 --> 00:26:29.070
Universe.
So, m - M at a

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:34.650
given red shift in an empty
Universe.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:44.090
So, what does the green curve
look like?

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:49.567
The green curve is Ω = 0.
That is to say,

00:26:49.567 --> 00:26:51.825
an empty Universe.
Student: [Inaudible]

00:26:51.825 --> 00:26:53.134
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah,

00:26:53.134 --> 00:26:55.769
yeah, yeah.
It's just a straight line at 0,

00:26:55.769 --> 00:26:59.082
because it's always true that
the empty Universe,

00:26:59.082 --> 00:27:02.119
minus what you expect for the
empty Universe,

00:27:02.119 --> 00:27:04.445
is 0.
So, what you've done,

00:27:04.445 --> 00:27:09.275
basically, is you've taken this
plot and tipped it 45º so that

00:27:09.275 --> 00:27:12.079
this green line is straight at
0.

00:27:12.079 --> 00:27:17.450
And then the brown line will
look like this--sorry,

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:21.210
the red line will look like
this.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.289
The brown line will look like
this.

00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:27.526
This, again,
Ω greater than 1,

00:27:27.526 --> 00:27:33.299
Ω less than 1.
Ω, 0.

00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:36.274
So, that's just convenient,
because then,

00:27:36.274 --> 00:27:39.991
you can have your scale here go
from, I don't know,

00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:43.039
-0.3 to +0.3,
or something like this.

00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:50.069
And so, you can see the whole
thing.

00:27:50.069 --> 00:27:52.319
Actually, I've got the signs
wrong, haven't I?

00:27:52.319 --> 00:27:54.930
Because bright things are a
minus.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:59.210
So, let's just put it as bright
and faint.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:02.329
So, we've done our very best to
confuse you, right?

00:28:02.329 --> 00:28:04.420
First of all,
we started with a magnitude

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.720
system that's upside down and
logarithmic.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.309
Second of all,
we took the intuitively simple

00:28:11.309 --> 00:28:14.960
plot of scale factor versus
time,

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.172
which actually tells you what
you need to know about the

00:28:17.172 --> 00:28:19.299
Universe: is it getting bigger?
Is it getting smaller?

00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:20.500
Is it going to have a Big
Crunch?

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.087
And we transformed it into this
rather stranger thing,

00:28:24.087 --> 00:28:27.404
where the things we are
plotting are the things we

00:28:27.404 --> 00:28:31.466
measure--but it's not at all
obvious how this translates into

00:28:31.466 --> 00:28:35.756
what the Universe is doing.
Then, not content with that,

00:28:35.756 --> 00:28:39.869
we take that whole thing and
subtract something you don't

00:28:39.869 --> 00:28:43.542
understand from it,
so as to flatten out one of the

00:28:43.542 --> 00:28:45.900
lines.
Okay?

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.250
So, it's a three-part exercise
in confusion.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:54.992
And I would say that the number
one conceptually difficult thing

00:28:54.992 --> 00:29:00.370
in this entire course is to
understand how this plot relates

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.329
to this plot,
and more difficultly,

00:29:03.329 --> 00:29:07.490
how this plot relates back to
the scale of the Universe plot.

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:12.472
And if you can understand that,
you can understand twenty-first

00:29:12.472 --> 00:29:15.858
century cosmology.
And so, we will work on this a

00:29:15.858 --> 00:29:18.526
little bit, so,
if you're not quite getting it

00:29:18.526 --> 00:29:21.479
yet, don't freak out.
You'll have plenty more

00:29:21.479 --> 00:29:24.339
opportunities to discuss it,
I assure you.

00:29:24.339 --> 00:29:28.028
In any case,
even if you're a little puzzled

00:29:28.028 --> 00:29:31.889
at the moment,
let's look at this plot because

00:29:31.889 --> 00:29:36.398
this is how the data show up.
So, there's an Ω = 0 line,

00:29:36.398 --> 00:29:39.884
which is straight.
And then, lines below it are

00:29:39.884 --> 00:29:44.264
increasingly large values of Ω.
And so, if you go out and

00:29:44.264 --> 00:29:47.992
measure a bunch of points,
you expect to see them kind of

00:29:47.992 --> 00:29:51.539
lying in a straight line here.
And then, you expect to see

00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:54.640
them falling below that straight
line, and depending on how far

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.490
below the straight line they
fall,

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.644
you can determine whether the
Universe is going to re-collapse

00:29:59.644 --> 00:30:01.091
or not.
So, if they end up,

00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:03.569
you know, down here,
it's going to re-collapse.

00:30:03.569 --> 00:30:06.500
If they end up here,
it's going to expand forever.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:12.140
Okay?
How are we doing?

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.460
Ready for some data?
Okay.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.722
So, in the 1990s,
as I mentioned,

00:30:17.722 --> 00:30:20.410
they actually made this
measurement.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.197
In fact, two different groups
made the measurement,

00:30:23.197 --> 00:30:25.576
and they were rivals.
They did things slightly

00:30:25.576 --> 00:30:27.127
differently.
They're measuring the same

00:30:27.127 --> 00:30:29.740
kinds of objects.
Here's what they found.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.400
Okay.
So, let's see.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.319
This is this Δ (m –
M).

00:30:35.319 --> 00:30:39.900
So, 0 on this plot is the empty
Universe.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:44.990
And then, this dotted line is
Ω.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:51.517
So, let me color code this the
way I had color-coded everything

00:30:51.517 --> 00:30:56.331
earlier.
So, I'm going to just take this

00:30:56.331 --> 00:31:04.851
and draw the relevant lines.
So, here's the green line at

00:31:04.851 --> 00:31:09.887
exactly Ω = 0.
And then, this thing is the

00:31:09.887 --> 00:31:12.550
brown line--sorry,
the red line.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:17.000
Got to get my colors straight.
Red line.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.527
This is Ω less than 1.
In fact, this particular line

00:31:21.527 --> 00:31:25.819
is for Ω = 1 / 4.
And then, the brown line is

00:31:25.819 --> 00:31:29.609
this thing here,
which is Ω = 1.

00:31:29.609 --> 00:31:38.654
So, if you fall below the brown
line, the Universe is going to

00:31:38.654 --> 00:31:41.359
re-collapse.
Right.

00:31:41.359 --> 00:31:43.950
What else do I want to say
about that?

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:46.960
Nothing, because I've now put
some points on there.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.829
Yes?
Student: Why are they

00:31:49.829 --> 00:31:53.018
lines [inaudible]
whereas the ones that you used

00:31:53.018 --> 00:31:55.881
before they were curved?
Professor Charles

00:31:55.881 --> 00:31:58.099
Bailyn: Oh,
these are actually curved.

00:31:58.099 --> 00:32:00.869
It's just, I exaggerated the
curvature.

00:32:00.869 --> 00:32:04.156
The reason that it comes out
less curved on this is it's only

00:32:04.156 --> 00:32:07.329
going up to a redshift of 1.
If you continued this out much

00:32:07.329 --> 00:32:09.880
further, the curvature would
become more obvious.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.009
But these are not,
in fact, straight lines.

00:32:12.009 --> 00:32:15.687
The green one's a straight line
because it's just at everything

00:32:15.687 --> 00:32:17.898
equals 0.
But there is curvature on these

00:32:17.898 --> 00:32:19.930
lines.
Okay.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.590
So, the problem's obvious.
Here are the observed points,

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:27.510
and they don't go through any
of these lines.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.484
And you can first of--okay.
So, there are many things to

00:32:30.484 --> 00:32:33.920
say about this.
First, the error bars.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.924
Let's talk about the error bars.
Redshifts are relatively easy

00:32:36.924 --> 00:32:39.733
to observe.
You can do that to high

00:32:39.733 --> 00:32:42.630
accuracy.
This distance modulus is more

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:46.378
complicated.
There are two kinds of errors

00:32:46.378 --> 00:32:49.940
incorporated into these error
bars.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.887
One is measurement errors--that
is to say, how accurately can

00:32:53.887 --> 00:32:57.440
you actually measure the
brightness of these things?

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.564
That's an error in m,
you know, how bright--how

00:33:00.564 --> 00:33:03.039
accurately can you measure these
things?

00:33:03.039 --> 00:33:05.521
They're pretty faint by the
time they're out at a redshift

00:33:05.521 --> 00:33:07.915
of .6.
But the other is how good a

00:33:07.915 --> 00:33:11.923
standard candle is.
How well do you know exactly

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:16.109
what the absolute magnitude is
supposed to be?

00:33:16.109 --> 00:33:22.030
So, accuracy of the standard
candle.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.677
And that's an error in big
M, because you don't

00:33:27.677 --> 00:33:30.657
know--these things turn out to
have a little bit of a spread in

00:33:30.657 --> 00:33:32.579
brightness, and you don't know
that.

00:33:32.579 --> 00:33:36.506
And so, that's why the nearby
ones, these ones down on this

00:33:36.506 --> 00:33:40.025
end, which you can measure,
really, quite precisely,

00:33:40.025 --> 00:33:43.656
still have substantial errors,
because you don't know how

00:33:43.656 --> 00:33:47.157
bright the standard candle is
supposed to be to perfect

00:33:47.157 --> 00:33:49.646
precision.
And so, you can see that down

00:33:49.646 --> 00:33:52.259
below a redshift of .2,
down in this region here,

00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:54.512
you're going to have a really
tough time telling the

00:33:54.512 --> 00:33:57.762
difference between these lines.
Because the lines are separated

00:33:57.762 --> 00:34:00.654
by a tiny fraction of a
magnitude and the errors on

00:34:00.654 --> 00:34:03.003
these things,
on any individual object,

00:34:03.003 --> 00:34:04.940
is several tenths of a
magnitude.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.625
So, you know,
pretty much all of these points

00:34:07.625 --> 00:34:10.982
go through all of the lines,
and so, that isn't going to

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:14.623
tell you a great deal.
By the time you're out in here,

00:34:14.623 --> 00:34:18.729
you're starting to get several
tenths of a magnitude difference

00:34:18.729 --> 00:34:21.553
in the prediction.
Now, the errors are still

00:34:21.553 --> 00:34:25.029
several tenths of a magnitude.
So, observing one such object

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:28.781
isn't going to tell you anything
because, supposing I observe any

00:34:28.781 --> 00:34:30.950
one of these things,
I don't care.

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:34.169
Here's an error bar.
And while it doesn't go through

00:34:34.169 --> 00:34:37.380
this line, that's only,
you know, two times the error.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.739
Two Sigma error for those of
you have studied statistics,

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:44.604
isn't such a crazy thing.
And so, one of these points

00:34:44.604 --> 00:34:47.429
would not tell you all that
much.

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:51.372
But on this plot,
which was published in 2003 and

00:34:51.372 --> 00:34:56.136
contains data up until about
2001, there are a couple dozen

00:34:56.136 --> 00:34:59.543
points.
Now, this line here,

00:34:59.543 --> 00:35:04.855
the red line with Ω = 1 / 4.
We already know that Ω has to

00:35:04.855 --> 00:35:07.863
be equal to at least 1 / 4,
because we've measured all that

00:35:07.863 --> 00:35:10.091
dark matter out there.
We added it up,

00:35:10.091 --> 00:35:12.885
and it comes out to about Ω =
1 / 4 or 1 / 3,

00:35:12.885 --> 00:35:16.827
or something like that.
And so, if there's nothing else

00:35:16.827 --> 00:35:20.506
in the Universe beyond what we
already know about,

00:35:20.506 --> 00:35:23.210
you expect it to be on this
line.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.665
If there is matter in the
Universe that we don't know

00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:27.789
about, you expect it to be below
that line.

00:35:27.789 --> 00:35:32.943
So, if you take the points at
redshifts greater than .2,

00:35:32.943 --> 00:35:37.582
the interesting fact is,
all of them lie above this

00:35:37.582 --> 00:35:41.309
line, and none of them lie below
that line.

00:35:41.309 --> 00:35:44.300
Now, each of them has a
different error.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.515
But nevertheless,
the points are all above the

00:35:46.515 --> 00:35:49.125
line.
So, if the Universe truly were

00:35:49.125 --> 00:35:53.280
following this red line here,
then what would you say?

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.111
You would say that half of them
should lie above and half of

00:35:56.111 --> 00:35:58.702
them--and points should lie
above--below just by random

00:35:58.702 --> 00:36:02.015
chance.
So, this is throwing two dozen

00:36:02.015 --> 00:36:07.679
coins and having them all come
up heads because they've all,

00:36:07.679 --> 00:36:10.070
by random chance,
if the Universe is following

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:11.929
this line, landed above the
line.

00:36:11.929 --> 00:36:14.480
So, you can figure out what the
probability of that is.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.177
It's--you know,
if there are 20 points and

00:36:17.177 --> 00:36:19.480
they're all heads,
that's 2^(20).

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.480
That's about--a probability of
one in a million.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.420
There was another team doing
the same experiment.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.347
They measured about the same
number of points,

00:36:28.347 --> 00:36:32.044
got the same result.
So, that's two incidences of a

00:36:32.044 --> 00:36:36.039
one in a million chance.
That's one in a trillion.

00:36:36.039 --> 00:36:40.902
So, random errors are not going
to get you back down onto the

00:36:40.902 --> 00:36:44.980
redline, much less there.
Now, look at the green line.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:49.030
This is an empty Universe.
Nothing in it at all.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:52.937
Maybe we're just totally wrong
and we've screwed up all the

00:36:52.937 --> 00:36:56.710
dark matter, and we've got only
two points below that.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:59.030
That's almost equally
improbable.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:03.499
And so, what we think is going
on is that this line actually

00:37:03.499 --> 00:37:07.744
goes above the green line.
And one current hypothesis for

00:37:07.744 --> 00:37:11.639
what such a line should be is
this solid line up here,

00:37:11.639 --> 00:37:15.528
which nicely goes through the
points in such a way that,

00:37:15.528 --> 00:37:19.911
kind of, half of them are above
and half of them are below--the

00:37:19.911 --> 00:37:23.882
way points ought to be.
So, this is quite strong

00:37:23.882 --> 00:37:27.576
evidence that,
in fact, what the Universe is

00:37:27.576 --> 00:37:32.560
doing is not going below that
line, but going above it.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:37.880
So, what does that tell us?
All right.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.929
Let's do this whole exercise
backwards.

00:37:39.929 --> 00:37:44.610
Δ (m – M)
versus Z.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:52.429
Here's the empty Universe,
and here's what we see.

00:37:52.429 --> 00:37:54.730
So, how does that go onto the
next plot?

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:59.720
This is now m - M
versus redshift again.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.308
Here's the empty Universe.
And so, what appears to be

00:38:04.308 --> 00:38:08.494
happening is this.
How does that,

00:38:08.494 --> 00:38:16.460
then, map onto the scale factor
versus the redshift?

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:20.580
Scale factor versus time, sorry.
Here's now.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:24.670
Here's 1.
Here's this.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:26.329
This is now still the empty
Universe.

00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:28.547
It's a straight line in this
case, and so,

00:38:28.547 --> 00:38:32.241
what is happening here?
If you go back and you look at

00:38:32.241 --> 00:38:36.532
a particular distance--that is
to say, a particular time

00:38:36.532 --> 00:38:41.646
ago--so, you're looking here.
The purple line here has a

00:38:41.646 --> 00:38:47.383
redshift that is smaller and
therefore the scale factor is

00:38:47.383 --> 00:38:53.869
larger.
So, you ought to be here, right?

00:38:53.869 --> 00:38:58.144
So, that's what we're
observing--the implication of

00:38:58.144 --> 00:39:02.760
which is that the future is
going to look like this.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.330
So, the Universe in this
is--Universe is expanding.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:12.375
We already knew that.
And the expansion is

00:39:12.375 --> 00:39:14.200
accelerating.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.530
Something is pushing the
Universe outwards.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.860
So, we had a thought all along.
What's going to happen?

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.270
Gravity is going to pull it
back together again.

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.170
It's going to be slowing down.
No, not true.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:39.150
The Universe is being pushed
outward by some kind of force,

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:46.305
by some kind of energy,
which has the characteristics

00:39:46.305 --> 00:39:51.541
of a repulsive gravity.
So, it's anti-gravity,

00:39:51.541 --> 00:39:53.407
if you like.
This is what the science

00:39:53.407 --> 00:39:55.059
fiction writers would certainly
call it.

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:57.639
It's something that pushes
things away from each other.

00:39:57.639 --> 00:40:01.379
And this pervades the Universe
in such a way that it actually

00:40:01.379 --> 00:40:04.619
dominates the behavior of the
Universe as a whole.

00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:12.460
We give this the name dark
energy, and we have absolutely

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.400
no idea what it is.

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:20.400
But, of course,
as my colleague,

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.232
Charlie Baltay,
likes to point out,

00:40:22.232 --> 00:40:25.249
we never actually admit to
people that we don't know what

00:40:25.249 --> 00:40:29.106
we're talking about.
So, you observe this kind of

00:40:29.106 --> 00:40:30.224
thing.
You don't say:

00:40:30.224 --> 00:40:31.990
we have no idea what's going on
in the Universe.

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:33.730
No.
You say: we discovered dark

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.679
energy.
Big triumph.

00:40:36.679 --> 00:40:40.680
And so, we have discovered dark
energy, and furthermore,

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.900
we know something about how
much of it there is--namely,

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.010
because we can actually measure
this curve.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:58.306
And so, you can ask:
what is the density of the dark

00:40:58.306 --> 00:41:05.407
energy compared to matter?
Now, you know how to compare

00:41:05.407 --> 00:41:06.699
energy to matter,
right?

00:41:06.699 --> 00:41:08.610
You have to use E =
mc^(2).

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:14.298
So, if you have energy--some
amount of energy per meter

00:41:14.298 --> 00:41:20.514
cubed, you can transform that
into energy / c^(2) per

00:41:20.514 --> 00:41:24.614
meter cubed,
and that now is in the same

00:41:24.614 --> 00:41:29.208
units as a matter density.
And so, you can have Ω of the

00:41:29.208 --> 00:41:32.621
matter, which we think is about
1 / 3, or 1 / 4,

00:41:32.621 --> 00:41:36.586
or something like that.
And you can ask:

00:41:36.586 --> 00:41:40.969
how much energy is there.
You can ask:

00:41:40.969 --> 00:41:45.430
how much Ω is there in energy,
in this dark energy?

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.758
Not photons.
Not ordinary kinds of energy,

00:41:47.758 --> 00:41:50.359
but this repulsive--this
mysterious, repulsive dark

00:41:50.359 --> 00:41:53.196
energy.
It's about three times the

00:41:53.196 --> 00:41:58.186
amount of matter--where Ω,
remember, is equal to density

00:41:58.186 --> 00:42:01.396
over the critical density,
and, you know,

00:42:01.396 --> 00:42:03.993
it doesn't matter whether it's
an energy density divided by

00:42:03.993 --> 00:42:06.100
c^(2),
or some amount of matter.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.344
Okay.
That's what we think the

00:42:09.344 --> 00:42:13.315
Universe consists of.
So, here is the famous pie

00:42:13.315 --> 00:42:18.230
chart of the Universe,
which tells you what's going

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.260
on.
So, you know how pie charts

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:23.349
work?
You start with a circle.

00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:29.059
That's everything,
and here's us.

00:42:29.059 --> 00:42:34.460
So, this is all ordinary
matter, and all ordinary kinds

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.760
of energy, photons,
what have you,

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.946
that we know about.
And it's something like 4% of

00:42:42.946 --> 00:42:46.612
the Universe.
Then, there's a big chunk

00:42:46.612 --> 00:42:48.430
that's dark matter.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.849
And that, we discussed last
time.

00:42:54.849 --> 00:42:57.790
The dark matter is this stuff
we can't see.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:59.597
It might be WIMPs.
It might be MACHOs,

00:42:59.597 --> 00:43:01.384
we don't know.
We can't see it,

00:43:01.384 --> 00:43:03.789
but we know it's there.
Why do we know it's there?

00:43:03.789 --> 00:43:07.273
Because it exerts gravitational
force on galaxies and stars in

00:43:07.273 --> 00:43:10.928
galaxies, and we can measure how
much of them there is by looking

00:43:10.928 --> 00:43:13.670
at stars--galaxies and clusters
of galaxies,

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.848
and inferring the mass of them
by observing the orbits of

00:43:16.848 --> 00:43:19.470
things around them,
just as we did with black holes;

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:22.471
just as we did with planets.
This is a fairly

00:43:22.471 --> 00:43:25.949
straightforward astronomical
technique.

00:43:25.949 --> 00:43:31.977
The rest of it--this region,
here, is dark energy,

00:43:31.977 --> 00:43:37.389
which not only can we not
detect directly,

00:43:37.389 --> 00:43:41.962
but it has a physical effect
unlike anything else we know

00:43:41.962 --> 00:43:45.800
anything about at all--namely,
it pushes out.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:52.287
It's a purely repulsive force
of some kind and that purely

00:43:52.287 --> 00:43:59.800
repulsive force provides 3/4 of
the mass energy of the Universe.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.635
Well, that's bad,
because we have even less

00:44:02.635 --> 00:44:06.214
idea--oh, and I should say--So,
we've been counting up

00:44:06.214 --> 00:44:09.050
frontiers and controversies with
time.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:12.239
This is Frontiers and
Controversies in 2007.

00:44:12.239 --> 00:44:14.550
What the heck is going on with
this pie chart?

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:18.680
What's this?
What's this and why?

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:23.582
That's what we need to find out.
Now, oddly enough,

00:44:23.582 --> 00:44:27.510
it turns out,
Einstein predicted this.

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:30.732
Einstein was a genius.
Only, he then retracted it and

00:44:30.732 --> 00:44:34.409
decided it was the greatest
mistake he had ever made.

00:44:34.409 --> 00:44:36.718
And then, because he said it
was a great mistake,

00:44:36.718 --> 00:44:38.690
everybody ignored it for
seventy years,

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.501
until we discovered the dark
energy, and then,

00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:41.710
somebody said:
oh, you know,

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:44.070
Einstein told us about this
already.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:51.325
And here's how--why he did it.
Remember, Einstein wanted a

00:44:51.325 --> 00:44:56.809
static Universe.
This is before Hubble

00:44:56.809 --> 00:45:01.670
discovered that the Universe was
expanding.

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:03.829
And so, Einstein was looking at
the implications of his

00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:06.349
equations of general relativity,
and he thought it would be nice

00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:08.503
if the Universe was static.
And the problem is,

00:45:08.503 --> 00:45:11.579
there's all this matter in the
Universe, so it attracts itself.

00:45:11.579 --> 00:45:14.230
So, it can't be static,
because if you try and hold it

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:15.829
in one place,
it'll fall down.

00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:19.451
It has to either be expanding
up or expanding down,

00:45:19.451 --> 00:45:23.289
just like the pen is either
going up or going down.

00:45:23.289 --> 00:45:24.530
But that's bad,
thought Einstein,

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:28.779
because it ought to be static.
So, he invented an additional

00:45:28.779 --> 00:45:33.553
term for his equation,
which he wrote down as a

00:45:33.553 --> 00:45:38.327
capital lambda [Λ]
and called the cosmological

00:45:38.327 --> 00:45:43.661
constant.
And this had generated a

00:45:43.661 --> 00:45:52.557
repulsive force that would
balance gravity and lead to a

00:45:52.557 --> 00:45:56.657
static Universe.
And it was allowed in the

00:45:56.657 --> 00:45:58.530
equations.
It fit fine into the equations.

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.477
There was no problem there.
Those of you who have done

00:46:01.477 --> 00:46:05.532
calculus, this shows up as a
constant of integration,

00:46:05.532 --> 00:46:08.340
so, it can be any value you
like.

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.100
If you don't know calculus,
ignore that last sentence.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:14.331
Okay.
And so, he invented this

00:46:14.331 --> 00:46:16.718
repulsive force,
this cosmological constant,

00:46:16.718 --> 00:46:19.493
to balance gravity,
so that you could have a static

00:46:19.493 --> 00:46:23.634
Universe.
Then, Hubble discovers that the

00:46:23.634 --> 00:46:28.409
Universe isn't static--discovers
expansion.

00:46:28.409 --> 00:46:32.643
And Einstein says:
damn, I could have predicted

00:46:32.643 --> 00:46:36.599
that, and then,
I would have been famous.

00:46:36.599 --> 00:46:43.780
So, Einstein says:
Λ was my biggest mistake.

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.474
Because if he hadn't been so
insistent that the Universe

00:46:46.474 --> 00:46:48.881
needed to turn out to be static,
he could have said,

00:46:48.881 --> 00:46:51.260
you know, my equations predict
that the Universe either has to

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.750
be expanding or contracting.
It has to be moving around.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:57.793
And then, Hubble would have
verified Einstein's prediction

00:46:57.793 --> 00:47:02.050
and Einstein might have won the
Nobel Prize, or something.

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:06.299
So, Λ was my biggest mistake.
Except, it turns out that it

00:47:06.299 --> 00:47:09.753
might be true.
So, this is one of those

00:47:09.753 --> 00:47:18.822
fables, right?
The fable of Einstein's biggest

00:47:18.822 --> 00:47:22.915
mistake.
And the moral is:

00:47:22.915 --> 00:47:29.501
interesting ideas can turn up
in a different context and turn

00:47:29.501 --> 00:47:36.087
out to be even more important
than you thought they were--can

00:47:36.087 --> 00:47:40.745
turn up in other contexts.
So, for seventy years,

00:47:40.745 --> 00:47:43.713
you know, the idea of this Λ
term, this cosmological

00:47:43.713 --> 00:47:46.510
constant, was kind of buried in
the textbooks.

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:50.016
It would be,
you know, Problem 53 at the end

00:47:50.016 --> 00:47:52.221
of chapter 7.
"Supposing there is a

00:47:52.221 --> 00:47:54.510
cosmological constant,
then, what would happen?"

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:58.167
And generations of grad
students thought about this for

00:47:58.167 --> 00:48:04.073
fifteen minutes and then forgot.
And then, all of a sudden,

00:48:04.073 --> 00:48:10.448
it turns out to be an
explanation for this very

00:48:10.448 --> 00:48:14.699
mysterious force.
Now, just because you stick it

00:48:14.699 --> 00:48:16.870
in an equation doesn't tell you
what it is.

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:19.986
So, what might it be?
The particle physicists,

00:48:19.986 --> 00:48:21.796
it turns out,
have a little bit of an

00:48:21.796 --> 00:48:24.310
explanation for this,
called the vacuum energy.

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:26.489
I'll talk more about that later.
Never mind what it is.

00:48:26.489 --> 00:48:31.517
I just wanted to point out that
if you calculate what the vacuum

00:48:31.517 --> 00:48:36.465
energy is, what you discover is
that Ω associated with this Λ

00:48:36.465 --> 00:48:41.348
is equal to 10^(120).
That's a particle physics

00:48:41.348 --> 00:48:46.335
calculation.
The observed Ω is equal to

00:48:46.335 --> 00:48:50.575
about 3/4, okay?
So, this is the wrongest

00:48:50.575 --> 00:48:53.900
calculation in the history of
science.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.840
It's off by 120 orders of
magnitude.

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.861
And in fact,
it would be very bad if this

00:48:58.861 --> 00:49:01.741
was true, because if there was
that much repulsive energy,

00:49:01.741 --> 00:49:05.230
no galaxies would have formed.
No planets would have formed.

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.570
We wouldn't be here.
All our stuff would have been

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:10.070
sprayed out into the far reaches
of the Universe.

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:13.059
So, we knew already that that
couldn't really be true.

00:49:13.059 --> 00:49:15.451
And so, what the particle
physicists said was,

00:49:15.451 --> 00:49:17.523
you know, obviously,
this can't be true,

00:49:17.523 --> 00:49:20.427
so it must somehow cancel out.
So, it must be 0,

00:49:20.427 --> 00:49:23.719
because otherwise we have this
embarrassing problem,

00:49:23.719 --> 00:49:28.484
which we know can't be true.
The fact that it's small,

00:49:28.484 --> 00:49:34.235
but not 0, is completely
mysterious, and that's where

00:49:34.235 --> 00:49:35.768
we'll start next time.

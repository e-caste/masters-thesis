00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.020
- Today we're launching
into pod four of the course,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.250
The Politics of Insecurity.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.250
And that's gonna preoccupy
us in the next two lectures.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.520
Let's start by going back a few years,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.203
before the real backlash starts in.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.550
This is 2011.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.880
- Today is the Tea Party
movement's biggest day.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.250
It's the day people are most frustrated

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.870
with their government,
when they're sitting down

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.200
and writing those checks
to the IRS and thinking,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.290
why am I paying all this money?

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.070
Today really highlights
the Tea Party's message

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.493
that politicians here in
Washington are just out of control.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.970
- They are fed up with Washington,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.166
and sick of runaway spending.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.590
(crowd clapping and cheering)

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.380
And at Tea Party rallies across
the country this weekend,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.820
there were plenty of Republicans
fighting for their support.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.730
- Let's send them this message.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.770
Don't tread on me.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.910
- Real solidarity means coming
together for the common good!

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.443
This Tea Party is real solidarity!

00:01:15.443 --> 00:01:16.820
(crowd yelling)

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.980
- Some, like former Alaska
Governor Sarah Palin,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.630
and Minnesota Congresswoman
Michelle Bachmann

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.200
are Tea Party favorites.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.570
- They've been very
exciting, very encouraged,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.980
about my potential
candidacy and I'm excited

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.060
to be here with them.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.650
- And not to be left out,
billionaire businessman

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.050
Donald Trump made his first appearance

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.500
at a Tea Party rally.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.320
- We have a man right now,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.450
that almost certainly will go
down as the worst president

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.180
in the history of the United States.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.160
- No one knows if Trump is serious.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.210
But some early polls have him on top

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.940
for the Republican nomination.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.040
He's gotten attention with his questions

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.440
about whether President Obama
was born in the United States.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.430
A widely discredited issue

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.210
other Republican
contenders have discarded.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.140
But in playing to the Tea
Party, the potential candidates

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.140
also will have a challenge.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.770
Recent polls show 47% of
Americans have an unfavorable

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.110
view of the movement.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.580
So candidates looking for Tea Party votes

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.780
have to be careful not
to alienate moderates.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.440
- That's what the White
House is sure hoping,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.430
that all of these Republican
presidential candidates

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.210
are out there, and sort of
waving the flag of the Tea Party.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.510
And they believe that that will
turn off independent voters.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.150
- Now this movement, of course,
started just two years ago.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.240
So this'll be the first
presidential campaign

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.370
these Tea Party voters
can try to influence.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.570
And we of course, don't
know what kind of impact

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.070
they will have in the fight
over the Republican nomination.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.320
But some of these candidates are assuming

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.120
that they're going to need
these Tea Party votes to win.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.800
- So that was 2011, two
years after the advent

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.880
of the Tea Party.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.230
People still didn't quite
know what to make of it.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.230
It had been quite a
successful lobbying group

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.050
in Washington in
producing major changes in

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.610
the Obamacare bill that had
been passed the previous year.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.380
But it still was very unclear
what sort of electoral force

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.903
it was going to be.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.480
Today's agenda is to
really explore the economic

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.440
demographic and cultural
sources of the 2016 backlash.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.363
And the larger puzzle of
resurgent identity politics.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.460
The political sources
of these developments

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.400
are gonna be deferred
until Thursday's lecture.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.420
And today we're really
going to be thinking

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.460
in terms of my ideas,
interests and institutions.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.370
We're really gonna be
thinking about the tensions

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.270
and complementarities
between interest and ideas

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.040
in the evolution, I
should say in the origins

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.490
and evolution of the backlash.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.200
So I want to begin by digging
a little more deeply into

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.200
the Tea Party ideology
that you saw being appealed

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.550
to there by going back to the
very start of the movement.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.643
And this is an anti,

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.980
tax rally in 2009, September of 2009.

00:04:23.015 --> 00:04:23.900
(bright piccolo music)

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.810
- Most of those there would
have called themselves patriots.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.260
That don't tread on me
flag was an early symbol

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.020
of the American Revolution,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.560
who argue that their government today

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.090
is betraying traditional principles.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.250
Steve Butler, a physician from Indiana,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.650
was handing out copies
of the Constitution.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.140
- If you read the quotes
of Thomas Jefferson,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.810
these guys were conservatives.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.907
And they said that the control
should be with the people

00:04:45.907 --> 00:04:47.400
and not with the big government.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.050
- Iliana Johnson came
to America from Romania

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.270
some 30 years ago.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.640
- I find myself now every
morning when I wake up,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.730
what kind of freedom have we lost today?

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.880
- You could also find plenty
of signs of something else.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.210
A rage that identifies President Obama

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.080
with Hitler, or Stalin, that
questions his citizenship.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.290
That seems to celebrate the
death of a famous liberal.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.670
And among the main currents
of the protestors here,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.140
a conviction that the media,
Fox News and Talk Radio

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.480
accepted, are deliberately
concealing the truth.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.610
- Yeah, they're blocking it out.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.230
I mean we know it, everybody knows it.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.710
- You see these people back here?

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.110
They all know there's something happening,

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.390
but the mainstream media,
they don't tell it.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.190
- It's your freedom!
(crowd yelling)

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.540
- But perhaps what most
united these protestors

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.660
was a broader discontent.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.770
A sense that they are not being heard.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.380
That their interests and
the nation's interest

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.630
are in the hands of a few.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.840
Dawn Newman came up from Texas.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.770
- It's all a good 'old boy network.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.723
You know they don't care what we think.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.540
Everybody's in everybody's bed, you know?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.530
And everybody's pocket.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.260
And it's who's got the most money.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.393
It's all about greed and power.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.090
- So there you have, I
think in a very tightly

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.630
distilled form, the four major elements

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.070
of the Tea Party outlook or ideology.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.150
One is this very staunch, anti-elitism.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.450
The sense that the political establishment

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.620
and the economic establishment,

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.620
are reflected in both political
parties is fundamentally

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.480
opposed to the interests
of people like themselves.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.080
Secondly, lots of conspiracy
theories floating around

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.640
this movement and you
saw some of them there.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.600
Conspiracies among the media
to conceal what's going on,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.903
being central among them.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.320
Third, hostility to
taxes and to government,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.180
especially to the federal government.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.330
And this sort of harkens
back I think to the

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.980
Edsel and Edsel that I talked
to you about some weeks ago.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.423
The connection between
the anti-tax movement,

00:07:08.047 --> 00:07:10.700
and typically for ethnic minorities.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.390
And you see these things
go together there as well

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.390
with the racism, questioning
President Obama's citizenship,

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.283
and so forth.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.340
And we're gonna come back
to the view of the world

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.530
that these four elements
constitute later in the lecture.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.910
But let's first talk
about the economic sources

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.850
of the backlash.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.730
And so, this is a little bit of review

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.630
of things I've told you before.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.033
But then some addition to it.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.040
Last week I pointed out
that one of the sources

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.170
of the anti-elitism in the backlash

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.610
was the divergence that on the one hand,

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.280
after the financial
crisis, people connected to

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.990
the financial sector, or with
significant financial assets,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.910
had their fortunes turn
around pretty quickly.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.460
And by 2016, 2017 all
the major stock markets

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.900
were basically back and much of the wealth

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.800
that had evaporated, or
had appeared to evaporate

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.480
during the financial crisis,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.200
had pretty much been
restored for those people.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.810
But that there was very different impact

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.210
on the real economy.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:35.610
And when I showed you these
slides first about unemployment

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.170
that more people were
unemployed for longer,

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:44.340
both in terms of short term unemployment,

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.313
and longer term unemployment.

00:08:49.287 --> 00:08:53.650
And that this didn't show
signs of ending any time soon.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.320
Indeed the long term unemployment
rates were the highest

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.210
at least since the 1950s.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.873
I talked about the impact
of the housing crisis,

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.880
the very high level of foreclosures.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.590
And then in a separate
lecture, I talked about

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:17.590
the disparate racial impact
of the housing crisis.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.783
So just building on some of that.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.240
If you look at what happened to real wages

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.200
in many of the advanced countries.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.370
But we're gonna focus today on the US.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.310
You can see that this is

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.640
real wages, changes in real wages,

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.240
between 2008 and 2017.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.940
And you can see it's very, very modest.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.780
So real incomes in the US
grew by over that period

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.243
by about 6% total.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.720
Not very much at all.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.720
And, if you look at who
benefited from the revival

00:10:02.497 --> 00:10:05.330
of the economy, even though
the growth was pretty slow,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.990
we had big increases
in productivity growth.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.450
That's the top line over there.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.330
But if you look at hourly
compensation with wages

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.300
there's two different measures of it,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.970
some technical differences
that need not concern us here.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.760
You can see that the
returns to the increases

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.760
in productivity were not
going to hourly wage workers.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.700
And this is part of the
Pacetti story that returns

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.700
to capital greatly exceed the
returns to labor over time.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.550
So it's a period of wage
stagnation for people

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.823
earning hourly wages.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.310
This decade, or eight
years if you like after

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.863
the financial crisis.

00:10:55.292 --> 00:10:58.970
Then, if we zoom out a little bit further

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.540
into the larger context of
long term employment insecurity

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.840
this has been building for decades.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.980
I talked in an earlier
lecture about the decline

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.120
of union membership, which
you can see beings pretty much

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.670
right after World War II.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:19.230
That's the blue line there,
declining union membership,

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:24.230
where as the share of
income going to the top 1%

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.920
is flat through about the 1970s.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.920
But then starts to take
off pretty dramatically.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.370
If you look at union membership falling

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.513
and middle class incomes, they
pretty much fall in tandem.

00:11:42.443 --> 00:11:44.493
So with the middle class share of income,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.210
as workers get less and less leverage,

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.053
also has been falling for decades.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.410
This is another slide I showed
you relatively recently,

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:03.360
this is the job insecurity of
the late baby boom workers,

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.360
workers born between 1957 and 1964,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.040
by age 52 have changed jobs

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.650
12.3 times on average.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:22.440
Very big levels of employment insecurity.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.790
And again, zooming out even further,

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:31.790
this is again the story
that's highlighted by Pacetti,

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.030
his co-author Siaz and many others that

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:40.710
we have had this very
high levels of inequality

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.630
that were in the Gilded Age.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.270
And people by the end of World War II,

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:51.270
thought were going away,
in fact have come back.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:56.410
And we're now at the same
levels of inequality that

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.970
haven't been see for more than a century.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.620
And this is of course
what partly motivated

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.150
the Occupy Wall Street movement,

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.840
which I will have more to say
about in a future lecture.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.840
And the Bernie Sanders insurgency
in the 2015-'16 primaries.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.810
And to give a sense of
what the Sanders campaign

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.420
was all about, let's go look at him,

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.560
or listen to him for a minute
a couple of years before

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.233
he decided to run for President.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:38.710
- Today, the wealthiest
400 individuals in America

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.010
own more wealth than the
bottom half of America,

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.630
150 million people.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.983
400 and 150 million.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.300
Today, and this is really quite amazing,

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.610
the six heirs to the Walmart fortune,

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.050
the Walmart company of
course started by Sam Walton.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:05.020
His children, one family,
now own more wealth

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.950
than do the bottom 30%
of the American people.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.950
One family, owns more
wealth than the bottom 30%,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.160
90 million Americans.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.340
And I know we have some of
my colleagues coming up here

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.547
and saying, "Look not everybody
in America's paying taxes.

00:14:24.547 --> 00:14:26.247
"Got millions of people are not paying

00:14:26.247 --> 00:14:28.000
"any taxes," no kidding!

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.210
They don't have any money,
'cause all of the money

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.833
is on the top.

00:14:34.393 --> 00:14:39.277
- So, that was the economic
story and the outrage

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.483
that Sanders is articulating there.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.890
He, on an interest based
story one would anticipate

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:53.340
that this would resonate
with large numbers of voters.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.530
And we've seen in this that

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:02.150
the damage that has been done,
was not just to white voters,

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.390
but to African Americans
disproportionately

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.720
and Hispanics during the housing crisis.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.910
And on an interest based
story, one would expect

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.970
that this was an opportunity
to build a coalition

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.250
that one would have anticipated would

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.030
do something about that.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:24.753
But, life has more imagination than us.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.770
What this story missed is
what I'm gonna spend most

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.840
of today's lecture talking about,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.980
namely the demographic
and cultural sources

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.100
of the backlash, which
have also been building

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.933
in different ways for a very long time.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.460
But before we dig into
that, I want to first make

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.010
one point that I think is

00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:57.500
a symptom of the fact
that this story is perhaps

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.940
a little bit too simple.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.220
At least as I've told it this far.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.020
And I'm referring here to the fact

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.090
that employment insecurity

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.963
is not just about working class voters.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.790
This very important new
book by our colleague

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.977
in the law school, Dan Markovits called,

00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:18.917
"The Meritocracy Trap."

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:25.230
A big part of Markovits'
message in that book

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:29.580
is about the so-called hollowing
out of the middle class

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:34.260
that many occupations that
used to be middle class

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.160
occupations of upwardly mobile people

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.860
are disappearing either offshore.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.380
Or more importantly to technology.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.650
So, if you think about
we talked about bankers

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.903
giving mortgages awhile ago.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.930
If you wanted a mortgage, the
person giving you the mortgage

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:57.870
was a local bank manager
who had worked their way up

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.660
to that position.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.550
It was a stable job.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.940
You would go down and have
meetings with that person.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.740
They might be a neighbor of yours

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.440
in a middle class community.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:15.050
Today when you apply for a
mortgage it's to Quicken Loans,

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.140
you do it over the phone
to somebody who probably

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.770
has a high school education.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.530
Maybe not even, on the
other end of the phone,

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.840
might not even be in the United States.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.770
They type your

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.750
characteristics and economic
data into a software program,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.460
an off the shelf software program, and

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.020
you get the answer as to
whether or not you're eligible

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.403
for a mortgage in a matter of minutes.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.870
The bank manager who
would have interviewed you

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.560
about your mortgage has
long since disappeared.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.133
Those jobs have gone away.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.310
So it's not just the bank
tellers, it's the bank managers.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:06.310
And it's creeping, this
disappearance of employment

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:10.570
is creeping up the occupational ladder.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.610
I, for the last seven years
now, have been teaching

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.200
at the Yale School of Management.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.587
Seven years ago, one
of the most attractive

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.550
things to do for people who were graduates

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:29.393
of business schools, was to
go into investment banking.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.220
It's not a favored activity anymore, why?

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.330
Because a lot of those
jobs are going to big data.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:42.330
There are algorithms now that
make is much less appealing

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.130
to go there, but then the question arises

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:49.170
what are these people going to do instead?

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.800
So we should when we think
about employment insecurity

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.590
we shouldn't just focus
on the disappearance

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.260
of industrial jobs that force people

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.650
into low paid service sector work.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.350
And if you want another data point

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.900
that tends to support this.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.900
If you look at primary voters
for Donald Trump in 2016,

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.940
I'm not talking about the general election

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.650
when you would expect
most Republicans to vote

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.060
for whoever the candidate was.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.040
But primary voters, when
they had many other choices.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.173
They don't fit the stereotype
of Joe lunch bucket.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.470
So if you look 1/3 of
the Trump primary voters

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.450
earn less than the median income.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:39.110
That's less than $50,000
is the median income

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:44.020
for a family of four in
the United States in 2016.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:48.510
Another third earns between
$50,000 and $100,000.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.790
And the third third
earned more than $100,000.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:56.710
So 2/3, by most definitions
of working class,

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.580
2/3 of Trump's primary supporters

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.603
were not working class voters.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.790
So, there's obviously
something much more complex

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:10.790
going on here than the stereotypical image

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.100
of who the Trump voter was.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.710
And it was something
that I think the sort of

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.070
Bernie Sanders kind of analysis,

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.790
didn't capture at all.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.070
And I think that

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.740
that's what we have to try and understand

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.570
with some other tools.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.050
Now, two very interesting

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:39.950
scholars, one a sociologist by the name of

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:46.100
Arlie Hochschild, and
another political scientist

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.170
by the name of Kathryn Cramer,

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:53.170
had spent the five years
leading up to 2016,

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:58.290
engaged in ethnographic
studies of angry white voters.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.410
We'll talk more about
Hochschild in a minute,

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:07.410
she studied and lived with
oil workers in Louisiana.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.070
Cramer studied rural workers in Wisconsin,

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.770
which she was trying to understand

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.203
the rise of Scott Walker.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.030
Cramer's book is called "The
Politics of Resentment."

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.830
And what was interesting about these,

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.523
both these books is that they,

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.650
the research for them
was really done before

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.300
the advent of the backlash
we're really studying now

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.960
in the years leading up to 2016.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.980
But they shared a lot of light on it.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:46.980
So, Hochschild's book,
"Strangers in their Own Land,"

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.380
is based on this five years
she spent in Louisiana

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.020
with oil workers who had
been downwardly mobile.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.010
Many of whom had lost their jobs.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.060
Their communities had often been savaged

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.670
by the environmental
effects of the industry

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.620
within which they were working.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.210
Lakes which they had fished in as children

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:10.910
were now so polluted that

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.310
the fish in them were all long since dead.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.870
There were very high levels of cancer

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.490
and other diseases that
were widely attributed

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.910
to the pollution in the community.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.490
Large numbers of people had been laid off,

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.043
because of mechanization of the industry.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:34.660
And yet, the paradox that
she tried to understand

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:39.660
was what that the anger
of most of these people

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.620
was directed not at the oil companies,

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.140
but at the government.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.830
And particularly at
the federal government.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.820
And she tried to understand this

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.253
through participant observation.

00:22:58.004 --> 00:23:02.780
Here's a summary that she
gives of the central finding

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.113
in her book.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.730
- I stuck upon something
I call the deep story.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:12.360
Which is a story that feels true.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.660
You take the facts out, you
take the moral judgements out

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.660
and have a picture, a
metaphor for what goes on.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.340
In this, people are waiting in line as in

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.050
a pilgrimage to the top of a hill

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.820
where there's the American dream.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.220
People have been waiting
in line a long time.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.180
They feel deserving, their feet are tired.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.720
The line hasn't moved in many years.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.720
And then they see, some people
cutting in line, who's that?

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.700
That would be blacks, who
now have access to jobs

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.400
that used to be reserved for whites.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.040
That's women now have
access to jobs reserved

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.253
formally for men.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:04.510
Immigrants and refugees,
and now endangered animals

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:10.350
all seem to be getting ahead
of you, having cut in line.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:14.250
Then, people notice Barack Obama,

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.720
a representative of
the federal government,

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.420
seeming to wave to the line cutters.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.410
He's sponsored them.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.660
Indeed the federal
government comes to seem like

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.940
an instrument of their marginalization.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.550
It has indirectly put them back.

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.330
You're now at the back of the line,

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:39.810
and no one's really
paying attention to you.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.880
And then someone ahead
of the line turns around

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.417
and says, "Oh you're a
Southern, ill-educated

00:24:46.417 --> 00:24:49.300
"Bible thumping redneck."

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.030
And then you feel estranged.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.300
There's a moment which you feel like now

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.700
a stranger in your own land.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.673
And you're kind of stuck until
one day someone comes along,

00:25:00.778 --> 00:25:03.860
a magisterial figure, powerful,

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:08.747
who sees and recognizes
your estrangement and says,

00:25:09.967 --> 00:25:13.377
"I'm gonna give you your
country back again."

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:19.350
- So, this is this
narrative of cutting in.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.390
There's some notion
that people are getting

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.890
ahead in line in front of you.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.120
And therefore preventing
you from advancing.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.760
If you read the whole book

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.210
it is a story of felt humiliation

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:39.470
and rage at this phenomenon.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:41.940
And so, when you think about

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.960
the reasons for their
dislike of the government,

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.710
first that they perceive the government

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.210
of an agent of this cutting in,

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:56.250
as the principal agent and
facilitator of this cutting in.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:00.930
And then, if they need
help from the government,

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.910
because they lose their jobs,

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.387
they have to go and be
interviewed and be humiliated

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.160
by people who have job security,

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.803
who have government pensions,
who might well not be white.

00:26:15.658 --> 00:26:20.580
And so, it reinforces this
sense of victimization.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:27.090
That feeds this narrative
of cutting in and what

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.563
Cramer calls the politics of resentment.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:38.320
I think it's important, this
was a study done in Louisiana,

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.810
but Cramer's is in Wisconsin.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:44.240
And there's since been
five or six other books.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.210
So this is not just a
phenomenon about the South.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.420
And I think that's
important to understand.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.010
It's really a much larger phenomenon.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:57.530
The story that Cramer
tells is very analogous.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.750
That rural voters in Wisconsin have many

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.800
of the same resentments,
and many of the same

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.453
causal stories that they tell themselves,

00:27:12.573 --> 00:27:14.873
about the sources of
their failure to advance,

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.853
and the sources of their alienation.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.157
And one other thing in
the Hochschild comments

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.720
that I just want to highlight
and I'm gonna come back to.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.150
Is that she noticed when she
described the cutting in there

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:41.107
she said, "Cutting in,
African Americans are now

00:27:41.107 --> 00:27:44.587
"getting jobs that were
formally reserved for whites.

00:27:44.587 --> 00:27:48.077
"And women are now getting
jobs that were formally

00:27:48.077 --> 00:27:49.950
"reserved for men."

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:54.060
And so this raises the whole issue

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.573
people's implicit baselines.

00:28:01.087 --> 00:28:02.207
When poor whites of this kind think about

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.790
something like affirmative action,

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.060
they see this as somebody being given

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.080
an unfair advantage, a leg up.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:18.080
But they can not perceive that
this is a remedial response

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.280
to a kind of advantage
that they had in the past.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.050
So a very important book on this subject

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:31.450
by Ira Katznelson, at the
Columbia Political Science

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.487
Department called, "When
Affirmative Action was White."

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:39.020
About the advantages that
whites previously enjoyed

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.083
that now have been eroded or taken away.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.840
As I said the question becomes,
what is one's baseline?

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.840
And this feeds if you
like what I'm gonna call

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:57.530
irreconcilable narratives about the nature

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.370
of what's going on the country.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:04.370
Because the people from whom
the traditional advantages

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.500
have been taken away can't
see that in the sense that

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.250
the fish can't see the
water it's swimming in.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.350
And so the narrative that they will tell

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:19.430
is in some important sense incommensurable

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.880
with the narratives that others will tell.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.230
So I want us to

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.600
try and understand the sources

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.980
of these irreconcilable
conflicting narratives

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.670
that I think have become in many ways

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.363
weaponized since 2016.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.000
And I think there's no
way to do this except

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.840
by going back into American history

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.190
and seeing how contentious and tangled

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.460
these perceptions of who has
had what advantage and when.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.043
And what is the appropriate
thing to do about it.

00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:06.730
Let's reflect on some
landmarks in the battles

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.980
over race in America.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:13.980
And particularly the battles
over separation of the races

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.230
and integration of the
races that have been here

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.360
literally since the country's founding.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.080
I'm not gonna go back all
the way to the founding,

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.990
but let's go back to before the Civil War.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:30.603
In 1857, in the Dred Scott case.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:37.100
This was a fugitive slave had
escaped to a non-slave state.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.790
The question was whether they could sue

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:45.520
in order to prevent themselves
from being returned.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.965
And the court held, among other things,

00:30:49.965 --> 00:30:54.250
this person had no standing to sue,

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.740
because black Americans were not citizens.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.740
And so this was essentially
an affirmation of the idea

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.060
that there has to be a
fundamental separation

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:12.060
of blacks and whites, because
blacks are not truly citizens.

00:31:14.702 --> 00:31:18.053
And this, Dred Scott
was one many decisions,

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:24.160
and this was in the court, but of course,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.890
things that were done in
the federal government

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:29.740
that eventually led to the
Civil War debates about

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:34.320
extending slavery to the
territories and so on.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.287
But then we get the Civil
War Amendments in 1865, 1868

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:43.840
and 1870, which at least on their face,

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.150
are pressing for more racial inclusion.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:51.683
Undoing if you like,
the Dred Scott decision.

00:31:52.797 --> 00:31:56.083
It outlawed slavery, they
created equal protection,

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.860
forbid it being denied
on the basis of race,

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.860
and the 15th Amendment
granted voting rights.

00:32:07.604 --> 00:32:09.940
It said that voting rights
could not be withheld

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:14.590
on the basis of race, or
previous condition of servitude.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:19.590
So there you see an attempt
to get more inclusive polity.

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:26.110
That then runs into the reality
that citizens in the South,

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.380
white citizens in the South had many,

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:37.380
had not accepted the outcome
of the Civil War as legitimate.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:41.940
And huge backlash and attempts to undo

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.813
the effect of the Civil War amendments.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.520
I talked in an earlier
lecture that the Supreme Court

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:52.010
was to some extent
complicit in that by reading

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.173
the amendments very narrowly.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.930
So as to limit their effect.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:03.140
And so we had the rise of Jim
Crow, first hard to partite,

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.240
and then soft to partite.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:10.240
1896, the court upheld the idea
of separation of the races,

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:15.200
again in the educational
context, and separate but equal

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:20.200
was a legitimate way to
organize K through 12 education.

00:33:22.774 --> 00:33:26.510
And we see this pull back from the idea

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.073
of an integrated polity.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:35.043
1935, the Social Security Act is passed.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:39.330
Another wonderful book by Ira Katznelson

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:43.190
called "Fear Itself,"
deals with the passage

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:44.390
of the New Deal.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:49.390
And in particular, the reality
that the only way in which

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:54.210
Roosevelt could get the
New Deal through congress,

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.493
which was controlled by,

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:02.060
the big committees were
controlled by Democrats

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.620
from the South who were
strongly opposed to all forms

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.160
of racial integration.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.940
Was to make essentially
exceptions that would

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.410
get them to support it.

00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:16.080
And in particular the Social Security Act

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.120
excluded domestic and
agricultural workers,

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.530
most of whom were African American.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:26.490
And so, that was if you
like, the quid for the quo.

00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:29.740
We're talking about
quid pro quo these days.

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.600
That was the quid for the quo,

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.300
to get enough Southern support to pass

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.010
the Social Security Act.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:41.097
Again a deprivation of
a racial group and the

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:50.290
continuing if you like, soft
de partite in that case,

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:53.550
because an proxy rather than race was used

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:56.090
to achieve the exclusion.

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:57.670
Then we get the Warren Cord,

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:02.670
and we get Brown versus Board
of Education in 1954 and 1955.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:09.560
Overturning Plesy and saying no separation

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:14.020
is not acceptable, there's
no possibility of having

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:19.020
equal education that is
based on racial separation.

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:23.470
That it's again bound to
be a form of discrimination

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:26.330
and perceived as such,
and experienced as such

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:27.710
by black children.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:32.710
And so the court ordered
integration of the schools,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:39.000
which turned out to be much
more difficult to achieve

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.610
for reasons that we have
talked about earlier,

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.663
than people might have anticipated.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.800
And so again you see this tussle over

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.140
what is the ideal?

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:54.960
You know the public ideal
of America is this notion

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.580
of a melting pot, that is
a nation of immigrants,

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:03.310
people come from all places, and Italians,

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:07.680
and Irish and others have
all eventually become

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.540
part of the melting pot.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.570
But, with African Americans it seems

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.920
to be fundamentally different,

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.973
because of this battle over inclusion.

00:36:19.155 --> 00:36:22.520
And of course we shouldn't
think that this is only

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.803
a battle among white voters.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:32.533
A lot of the conversation about
inclusion versus exclusion

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:38.570
tends to treat African
Americans as incapable

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:42.900
of using agency of their
own on these matters.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.933
Which of course is not the case.

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:49.463
If you look at the history
of the Civil Rights Movement,

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:55.370
Martin Luther King was very
much for holding up America

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:59.070
to its own ideology.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:02.880
And saying you're not
living up to the ideals

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.640
which you profess.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.010
This is what Michael Walzer
calls eminent criticism

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:13.010
in his little book, "Interpretation
and Social Criticism."

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:18.070
You take the melting pot
ideal and the immigrant story

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:23.940
and you say it's being
violated with respect

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.010
to African Americans,
you're being hypocritical.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.470
We need to have the

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.520
kind of inclusion the
American dream should

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.563
be equally available to all.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:43.150
But not everybody in the African
American community agreed.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.830
And a rift opened up, the young...

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:53.120
A young activist by the name of Malcolm X

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.300
took a very different view of the matter.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:59.233
So let's listen to Malcolm
X for a minute or two.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.460
- What is your attitude on the relations

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.940
between the black and white races,

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.450
what do you seek to accomplish?

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:11.320
- The best way to solve the problem that

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.520
black people are involved in this country,

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.710
is to let us separate from whites

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:19.420
and solve our own problems.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.170
Do for ourselves that which
whites do for themselves.

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.720
Stop baiting the white man
and stand on our own feet

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.890
and solve our own problems.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:30.220
- Is it far to say as a
generality and as a succinct way

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.710
to put it that you believe
in segregation of the races?

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.110
- Segregation is that which is forced

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:37.250
upon inferiors by superiors.

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:40.090
Separation is done
voluntary by two equals.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.030
You never refer to the oriental community

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.670
in which orientals live exclusively

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:46.330
as a segregated community.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.300
Because they live there voluntarily.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.410
Everything there is controlled by them.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.850
The economy, the politics,
the civic organizations,

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:54.790
but the negro community is referred

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:56.700
to a segregated community.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.730
Because Negros are forced
to live in that community

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:01.410
contrary to their will.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.320
And they don't control the
businesses of their community.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.270
They don't control the
politics of their community,

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:07.960
nor their social life.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.330
We do believe in separation,
standing on our own feet,

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:14.740
among our own kind, and
solving our own problems.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.680
And that's the only way
you'll get a solution

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.327
to the vital race problem in this country.

00:39:19.327 --> 00:39:21.360
Our people should unite among ourselves

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.270
and try to solve our own problems,

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:25.930
instead of trying to force
ourselves upon whites

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.553
and blame them for our plight.

00:39:30.179 --> 00:39:33.720
- Could we press for a very
simple answer to one question?

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.350
Do you hate all white people?

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:37.770
- I don't think it's a fair question.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:40.020
White man doesn't even
come into my attitude.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.300
Mr. Mohammad teaches us
to love our own kind,

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.840
and let the white man
take care of himself.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.940
For a white man today, sir,

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:53.030
after kidnapping millions
of black people from Africa,

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.130
stripping them of all
human characteristics,

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:57.730
and relegating them to
the role of chattel,

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.740
or cattle, or animals,
commodity, merchandise

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.170
that can be bought and sold at will.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:07.010
And then 100 years since the
Emancipation Proclamation,

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.580
using every type of deceptive method

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:13.800
to further us into slavery,
called second class citizenship.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.760
I think that it would
take a whole lot of nerve

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.050
for white people today to
ask Negros do they hate

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:22.070
all of the injustices that
black people are crying out

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:25.100
against in this country,
are being inflicted

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.720
upon them by whites.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.090
It is the whites who
are depriving our people

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.330
of civil rights.

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:34.420
It is whites who are depriving
our people of implementing

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:39.000
what the Supreme Court decision
said should be implemented.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.120
Wherever black people
turn, they are facing

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.570
the hostility of whites.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:46.110
Martin Luther King teaches
Negros to love all white people

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:46.977
no matter what they do to you.

00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:49.540
And the same whites whom
he teaches Negros to love,

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.450
sic dogs on him, sic
dogs on their children,

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.780
dogs on their women, and
dogs on their babies.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.310
So, I think it's very
hypocritical on the part of whites

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:59.550
to accuse Mr. Mohammad of a hate teacher,

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.130
because he says separation.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.060
And then sic dogs on Martin Luther King

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.570
who is teaching integration.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:06.750
It means that no matter
what the Negro does

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.610
he is not going to get along with whites.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:10.920
So I think that Mr.
Mohammad's whole philosophy

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.593
is more intelligent than Mr. King's.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.850
- So that was this, he
was a representative

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:23.510
of the black nationalist idea that trying

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.750
to get integration into

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:30.460
the dominant culture was a fool's errand.

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.140
It hadn't worked in 100 years,

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.730
and it wasn't gonna work any time soon.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:39.650
And so, there should be
this separatist agenda

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:43.800
that he had gotten behind.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.800
It's important to say that he
subsequently changed his mind.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:51.670
He had a falling out with Elijah Mohammad

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.580
who he talks about there.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:57.960
And he spent some time
traveling in Saudi Arabia

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:02.530
and elsewhere and saw
that there were Muslims

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:07.530
who of many different colors,
who actually did get along

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.223
and work together.

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:14.060
In the following year
he actually separated

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.690
from the nation of Islam,
and began to support

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.590
the civil rights agenda,

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:22.713
although he remained a black nationalist.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:29.706
His falling out with the
nation of Islam was so grave

00:42:29.706 --> 00:42:32.760
that they actually, they assassinated him,

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.430
as I'm sure some of you know.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:38.210
The following year he was murdered.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:42.590
But interestingly, there's
a curious kind of historical

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.053
convergence because,

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.090
Malcolm X became more
in favor of integration

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.100
and the civil rights agenda.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.381
Whereas actually Martin Luther King,

00:42:55.381 --> 00:42:59.370
in the last years of his life would become

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:04.370
less sanguine about the
possibilities of integration.

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:09.883
And by the time he was
assassinated four years later,

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:15.940
he said why he had not given up hope,

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.940
he was no longer optimistic having seen

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:23.603
how little had been achieved by that time.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.610
So, but there you have it.

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:32.610
You have this rift up in the
African American community

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.200
over integration and separation.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.430
Which would subsequently
become transformed

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:43.480
into debates about multiculturalism versus

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.030
the integration American dream.

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:51.520
Should we try and get
everybody to approximate

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.363
to some national norm?

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:58.320
Or, should we respect the differences

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.620
among different groups?

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:05.620
And this would become a
central motif in battles

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:10.290
about conflicting
narratives going forward.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:14.950
So, if we then think about
the two great achievements

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:18.350
of the 1960s from the
point of view of race.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:20.770
And perhaps the two greatest achievements

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.463
including the decades since then,

00:44:23.463 --> 00:44:27.280
were the Civil Rights Act of 1964,

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.873
and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

00:44:30.862 --> 00:44:35.120
And these were seen as
great achievements for

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.310
the integrationist view,
that people were no longer

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:43.700
gonna be denied just the formal
incidents of citizenship,

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:48.700
but the substantive
incidence of citizenship.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:49.543
And,

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:56.080
that this was gonna be
the path going forward.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:00.720
It should be said the reason
there were two separate pieces

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.873
of legislation was that in 1964.

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.730
The Johnson Administration
was not in favor

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:12.160
of voting rights legislation,

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.823
because they thought it would
be potentially too explosive.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:22.700
And battles over voting
rights had also beset

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.923
only during the New Deal.

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.900
The Roosevelt Administration
in their battles

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:32.433
with Southerners who controlled congress.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.910
After the passage of the Civil Rights Act

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:39.280
was when the first big
wave of racial violence

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.900
exploded in the US.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:45.200
There wasn't racial
violence before the passage

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.330
of the Civil Rights Act, it came later.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:51.050
And that that was what eventually prompted

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:55.100
the recognition that it
was gonna be essential

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.590
to have voting rights legislation.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:01.563
So that's why we had two
pieces of legislation.

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:07.510
Another important landmark I
think I the evolving narratives

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:10.970
was the publication of
what came to be known

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:14.713
as the Moynihan Report,
named for Patrick Moynihan,

00:46:16.765 --> 00:46:19.080
a famous senator who

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:26.120
brought a very different
set of assumptions and tools

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:30.623
to thinking about racial
disparities in the United States.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:35.530
The Moynihan Report was
called The Negro Family,

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:38.570
the Case for National Action.

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:43.160
And it was, I think, an
early indication of how

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:48.160
the views of white elites,
who think of themselves

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:53.240
as progressive harbingers of change,

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.390
can be perceived very
differently by the people

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:59.970
about whom they are talking.

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:04.310
And what concerned Moynihan
was the high levels of

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:09.573
out of wedlock births
in the black community.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:15.990
So, you can see on the
slide the Moynihan Report

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:17.973
is released in 1965.

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.800
And at that time,

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.140
African Americans had about

00:47:27.431 --> 00:47:32.431
28% of children were born to
mothers who were not married.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:37.660
And the numbers were, and the
percentages were much lower

00:47:39.029 --> 00:47:43.320
among Hispanics, and whites
and all other groups.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.850
So, this produced another narrative

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:50.260
that would become hugely contentious about

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:54.093
the social pathologies of the
black underclass, so called.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:58.470
And that it was really the
disintegration of the family

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:03.200
that was at the roots of the difficulties

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:06.433
being experienced in the black community.

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:13.380
Again, this was widely trumpeted by some

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:17.050
as an important thing that
needed to be dealt with.

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:22.050
But also widely vilified
by others as again denying

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.490
the agency of African
Americans and using language

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:30.610
and terminology of medical,
medicalized terminology

00:48:32.481 --> 00:48:36.270
of pathologies and so on.

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:39.540
And interestingly of course, the numbers

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.200
were hotly disputed at the time.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.543
And if you look at how
they've evolved subsequently,

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:50.180
you can see that

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:58.030
the number of children born out of wedlock

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:01.520
in white families today is just as high

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:06.130
as the number of children
born out of wedlock in 1965

00:49:07.737 --> 00:49:10.820
when Moynihan was writing.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:13.780
And moreover, and I
think this is the reason

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.770
we get an irreconcilable
narratives about this,

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:19.773
if you ask the question how many,

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:24.000
you know where are the out
of wedlock children born?

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.680
Of course, because the white
community is much larger

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.640
than the African American community,

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.280
2/3 of out of wedlock
children then and now

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.250
are actually born to white parents.

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:41.850
And so, you can find if you like,

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:45.660
if you want to find facts to
support a different narrative

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:50.660
there are plenty of conflicting
stories that can be told.

00:49:53.855 --> 00:49:55.830
You know another piece
of this is that people

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:57.410
would point out that

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:01.790
when upper middle class
white people decide

00:50:02.908 --> 00:50:06.490
not to get married, it's seen
as a choice of lifestyle.

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:08.520
But when a poor black person does it,

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.200
it's seen as a social pathology.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:15.450
And so again, you find
that these conflicting

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:19.450
moral narratives are irreconcilable.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.700
People glum onto different facts,

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:26.530
and use them as the
decisive ones to illustrate

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:29.253
what it is that they are talking about.

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:35.110
So, I think that the Moynihan Report

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.500
foregrounded a lot of these
debates about African Americans

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:44.290
in ways that made people
increasingly speak

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:46.443
past one another.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.360
Nixon's Southern strategy
in 1968, we've talked about

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.200
this in an earlier lecture.

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.940
This is the backlash against
the Civil Rights Act,

00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:59.250
and the Voting Rights Act.

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:02.690
He takes advantage of that by recognizing

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:05.210
that there's a second dimension,

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.990
when we talked about the Downsian Models.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:11.810
That there's a second
dimension in that resistance

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:16.530
to racial integration matters
more to many Southern whites

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:21.260
than economic benefits
from the welfare state.

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:25.923
And so it's possible to, if you like,

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.620
divide Southern whites
by appealing to race.

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:37.160
And that was Nixon's Southern strategy.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.060
And again I think brought racial divisions

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:44.800
back into the foreground
of American politics.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.580
And then the next really important step,

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:51.010
I think comes in 1971.

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:55.470
And so this is the McGovern-Fraser report

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:58.940
on the structure of the Democratic Party.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.180
The Democratic Party had
been in a major crisis

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.473
in the late 1960s.

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.610
Not only because of the assassinations

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:10.853
of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King,

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:15.670
who had both been strong
supporters of civil rights,

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:20.670
but the 1968 election had been explosive

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.040
for the Democratic Party.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:26.090
But what had happened was not withstanding

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:30.570
Lyndon Johnson's massive victory in 1964.

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:35.210
A huge landslide he was
fortunate to be running

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:37.733
against Barry Goldwater at that time.

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:42.740
Goldwater was sufficiently
far from the mainstream

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.310
of American politics, that
Johnson could prevail.

00:52:51.198 --> 00:52:54.600
And he had used those majorities to enact

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:58.760
the civil rights legislation
that I've already talked about.

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:02.160
But he also, of course,
massively escalated

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.500
the increasingly unpopular war in Vietnam.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:08.970
And by the time 1968 rolled around,

00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:12.710
it was clear that Johnson
couldn't run for reelection.

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:14.343
He wasn't going to win.

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:18.380
But this was at a time
when parties would govern

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:19.307
much more top down.

00:53:19.307 --> 00:53:22.960
I will talk more about that on Thursday.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.687
And there was a sense that

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:35.450
the anti-war sentiment
in the Democratic Party

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.230
had to be contained.

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:43.160
But the trouble was once
Johnson was not running,

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.350
all of the candidates who were running

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:48.200
were anti-war candidates.

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.720
So, Vice President Hubert Humphrey

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:54.000
was sort of parachuted into the race.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.840
He didn't run in any primaries,

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.740
he was named as the candidate.

00:53:57.740 --> 00:54:00.210
And this produced an explosion

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:03.890
at the Democratic National
Convention in Chicago.

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:07.660
And there was violence in the streets.

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.380
And there was a strong sense of crisis

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.040
in the Democratic Party.

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:15.970
And this produced a movement for reform.

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:17.930
No more smoke filled rooms.

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:21.940
We are going to democratize
the Democratic Party.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.030
And so, a political scientist,

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:27.090
a very distinguished political scientist

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:30.700
by the name of Austin Ranney
chaired this commission

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:34.860
with some others that became known as

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:37.970
the Mcgovern-Fraser Commission.

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:41.260
And it recommended, among other things,

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.510
much greater use of primaries.

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:46.550
And I'll talk more about that on Thursday.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:50.900
But also democratization
of the power structures

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:52.130
of the Democratic Party.

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:56.350
And in particular, the use of quotas

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:58.880
for various minority for women,

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:03.330
and various minority
groups in the decisions

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:08.330
about platform committees,
the governance of the party,

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.290
the selection of delegates.

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:13.220
Much more what we've since come

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:16.150
to call descriptive representation.

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:20.140
Much, a kind of that
different groups must all

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:25.000
be represented in the governance
of the Democratic Party.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.543
And that indeed is what transpired.

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:35.260
And this is part and
parcel of the acceleration

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:40.260
and attention to racial
and ethnic characteristics

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.870
in thinking about the
distribution of offices

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:47.270
and other benefits.

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:52.100
That same decade, in 1978,
the Supreme Court finally

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:55.200
took up the question of affirmative action

00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:00.200
in this Bakke decision in
University of California

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:02.740
Davis Medical School.

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:07.403
Which had set aside some
positions for minority candidates.

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.970
And Bakke was somebody
who scored less well,

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:16.030
I'm sorry, scored better on the test than

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:18.440
the minority candidates who were admitted

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:22.770
in the set aside places and he sued.

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.173
And he prevailed.

00:56:25.583 --> 00:56:30.583
But, what was interesting
in the decision was that

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:35.300
the court said you can't
have quotas for minorities,

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:38.030
but you can take race into account.

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:42.970
And this then became the moment at which

00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:49.110
the hugely fought subsequent
history of battles

00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:51.950
about affirmative action got started.

00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:55.290
And particularly with
words like diversity.

00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:59.360
We're now going through this
in all the elite universities

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:03.020
of the government looking
at whether diversity's

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:08.020
being used as a smoke screen
for ethnic and racial quotas.

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:12.630
You can have diversity, you
can take race into account,

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:15.650
among other characteristics,
but you can't have quotas.

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:20.410
And so, this whole debate
about affirmative action

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:22.420
has become another one

00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:27.420
of these conflicting moral narratives.

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:34.853
In 1984, in the Democratic race,

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:40.040
we're now in the middle of
the Reagan Administration

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:45.040
and the Democrats are running, basically.

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:49.960
Walter Mondale is gonna
likely be the candidate.

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:54.960
And Jesse Jackson, a young civil
rights leader at that time,

00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.200
has mounted a campaign against
him, did surprisingly well

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.840
in a number of primaries.

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.830
But in the end had to support the ticket.

00:58:04.830 --> 00:58:09.830
And he makes a speech at the
Democratic National Convention

00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:14.070
in 1984, where he tries to put together

00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:16.100
these very disparate ideas

00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:20.780
of melting pot versus multiculturalism.

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:25.270
And he uses the metaphor
of a rainbow coalition.

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:28.610
So he's trying to square
the circle, if you like.

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:31.393
And this is how he goes about it.

00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:36.370
- Our flag is red, white and blue.

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:39.730
But our nation is rainbow,
red, yellow, brown,

00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:41.750
black and white, we're all precious

00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.648
in God's sight!
(crowds cheering)

00:58:44.648 --> 00:58:49.481
(crowds yelling, applauding and cheering)

00:59:01.135 --> 00:59:06.050
America's not like a blanket,
one piece of unbroken cloth,

00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:10.240
the same color, the same
texture, the same size.

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.520
America's more like a quilt,

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:17.370
many patches, many pieces,
many colors, many sizes.

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:20.893
All woven and held together
by a common thread.

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:25.080
The white, the Hispanic, the
black, the Arab, the Jew,

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:28.020
the woman, the Native
American, the small farmer,

00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.890
the business person,
the environmentalists,

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:32.500
the peace activists, the young, the old,

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.750
the lesbian, the gay and the disabled,

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:36.213
make up the American quilt.

00:59:37.053 --> 00:59:41.053
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:51.360
Even in our fractured state,

00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:54.810
all of us count and fit somewhere.

00:59:54.810 --> 00:59:59.120
We have proven that we can
survive without each other.

00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.980
But we have not proven that
we can win and make progress

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.890
without each other, we must come together.

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:07.120
(crowd cheers)

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:11.030
- So there you have the
idea of a rainbow coalition.

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:14.290
And it's interesting that
when you actually go back

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:18.460
and find the speech, it's
very clear that he intends

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.470
everyone to be included.

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:23.220
But again, this is an
area where I think you get

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.060
divergent narratives, because the...

01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:33.910
In the commentary on the
history of identity politics,

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:38.273
and racial identity politics in the US,

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:42.972
this is interpreted as the moment at which

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:46.620
the Democratic Party
starts to think of itself

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:49.150
as a patchwork of minorities.

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:52.577
We talked about the
patchwork metaphor there.

01:00:52.577 --> 01:00:54.630
But a patchwork of minorities,

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:57.943
a strong deference to multiculturalism.

01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:04.660
All the different minorities
should form an alliance

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.790
to change the status quo.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:11.680
Whereas in the actual
speech he's very clear that

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.780
he's also referring to whites.

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:17.910
But that's not how it
came to be interpreted

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:20.070
in the dominant lexicon.

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:22.497
And indeed you can hear people say,

01:01:22.497 --> 01:01:23.927
"Well the thing about a rainbow,

01:01:23.927 --> 01:01:27.450
"it contains every color except white."

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:32.343
And so the notion that this
patchwork of minorities,

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:36.380
if that becomes the dominant ethos

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:40.520
of the Democratic Party,
there's gonna be no place in it

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:44.530
for the sort of people
that Arlie Hochschild

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:49.083
is talking about when she's
talking about cutting in.

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:58.420
There we have the idea
of the rainbow coalition.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.980
And it's important to
say that while the idea

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:05.900
of descriptive representation in politics

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.420
starts in the Democratic Party

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.710
with the Mcgovern-Fraser reforms.

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:15.300
It also migrates into the
political system more broadly

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:18.840
with the advent of majority
minority districts.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:22.883
And the fight over majority
minority districts.

01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:28.870
This was the idea that
was developed in order

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.080
to try and get African
Americans elected to congress.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:38.400
Particularly from the South,
where it seemed almost

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.500
impossible to do that.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.450
And this is partly because
of the way districting

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:45.760
is done in the United States.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.800
It's done by whoever,
at least at this time,

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.340
it's now a more complicated story,

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:54.700
but at this time the
districts were always drawn

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:57.940
by whoever controlled
the state legislature

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:01.720
after the decennial census.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.720
So you'd have a new census and then,

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.330
it's still the case in 2/3 of the states,

01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:11.330
that some states now have
independent commissions to do it.

01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:16.330
But basically, most states
still have this system.

01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:19.760
And what was done was
the districts were drawn,

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.640
so as to dilute African
American representation.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.180
And when the Voting Rights
Act was reauthorized in 1982,

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:36.270
stronger requirements were put in

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:40.060
that essentially said that the section two

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:44.140
of the Voting Rights Act required
that drawing of districts

01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:48.600
in certain circumstances
that would lead to

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.850
the possibility of
electing African Americans.

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:55.160
And it was, you might
think somewhat surprising

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:59.790
that legislation reauthorized
in 1982 would do this.

01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:02.630
Because this is during
the Reagan Administration

01:04:03.571 --> 01:04:06.940
which one would not have
thought would be particularly

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:08.830
friendly to this idea.

01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:12.940
But although the White
House was not in favor

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.300
of this legislation.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.241
In fact, a number of
Republicans on the hill,

01:04:18.241 --> 01:04:22.210
and Republican strategists
were in favor of it.

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:27.210
Because they saw it as a
possibility of actually reducing

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.030
Democratic strength in the South.

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:34.780
So the thought would
be, well if you create

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:37.770
a majority minority
district you might increase

01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:40.680
the number of African
Americans in congress

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.930
at the expense of reducing the number

01:04:43.930 --> 01:04:45.640
of Democrats in congress.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:49.870
And so some people have spoken
about an unholy alliance

01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:52.500
between the congressional black caucus

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:56.240
and congressional Republicans.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.550
And at some points even

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:02.790
the Justice Department
to support this idea,

01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:06.910
or at least not to
oppose it very strongly,

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:11.280
so as to, as I said, people
with very different motives,

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.820
the congressional black caucus
wanted to increase its size.

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.590
But Republicans who supported this idea

01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:21.580
saw it as a way of strengthening
themselves in the house.

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:26.580
In any case in 1986 the Supreme
Court took up this matter

01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:31.770
and said that it's okay to have
majority minority districts,

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.440
provided the minority group
is large and compact enough

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:43.470
to constitute a single district.

01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:47.480
And provided the group
is politically cohesive

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.123
and can demonstrate that.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:55.630
Provided the minority group
can show that it votes

01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:58.510
sufficiently as a group to defeat

01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:02.600
the minority group's preferred candidate.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:07.600
So the idea was if you can show
that you're voting together

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.683
as a group, and you conceive
yourself as a group,

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.150
they can draw districts
to increase minorities.

01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:21.855
And so as of 2015 I believe
there were 122 majority

01:06:21.855 --> 01:06:24.710
minority districts in the United States,

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:29.710
which is roughly a 1/4 of
the districts in the house.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.910
So again, you have

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:40.080
appeal to the idea of
separation in drawing districts,

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.320
creating districts which will send

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.810
a minority candidate to congress.

01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:47.230
Which they indeed did.

01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:50.400
The number of minority
candidates in congress increased

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.670
as a result of this.

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:55.700
And it should be said
that in state legislatures

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.680
the same thing was done.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.230
Again, this was as a
response to previous forms

01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:03.533
of districting,

01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:11.830
that had excluded African
Americans from the possibility

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000
of electing African Americans to office.

01:07:18.973 --> 01:07:23.973
2009 Reece versus Destefano,

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.820
the reason I bring this
case up is I think again,

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.610
it really speaks to the conflicting,

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:34.610
irreconcilably conflicting
narratives that have beset

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.720
these debates about
inclusion and exclusion.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.320
So this was a Connecticut case,

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.803
Mayor John Destefano, mayor of New Haven.

01:07:45.002 --> 01:07:48.320
This was a firefighter's union case.

01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:51.223
And what had happened was

01:07:54.030 --> 01:07:57.050
the city of New Haven had given an exam

01:07:57.050 --> 01:08:00.933
for promotion to officer.

01:08:04.201 --> 01:08:07.610
No African Americans had
done well enough on the exam

01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:12.050
to be promoted, so the
city fairing litigation

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:16.800
from African Americans
about a discriminatory test.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.713
At least a test that had
a discriminatory impact,

01:08:22.052 --> 01:08:27.052
disregarded the results of
the test, and didn't use it.

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.410
This then produced a lawsuit.

01:08:29.410 --> 01:08:31.863
There was one Hispanic,

01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:35.810
and 19 white plaintiffs.

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:39.383
And the court upheld their objection.

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:47.935
The decision to get rid of the test was

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:56.060
held to violate the rights
of Reece and his colleagues.

01:08:56.490 --> 01:08:58.920
So the reason I bring
this up in this context

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.810
is not about the result,

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:04.580
but rather it really
underlines one of the realities

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:06.170
about affirmative action.

01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:11.170
Which is that we tend to
think about affirmative action

01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:15.380
very differently from the
way many people experience

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.510
it on the ground.

01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:20.650
This was summed up in
1995 in a book by a man

01:09:20.650 --> 01:09:24.583
called Michael Lynn, "The
Next American Nation,

01:09:29.847 --> 01:09:31.397
"The New Nationalism and the
Fourth American Revolution."

01:09:36.591 --> 01:09:39.930
He had a discussion of what
he called a white over class.

01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:43.250
Again, this is the kind of liberal elites

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:48.250
that would turn out to be
objects of rage and ire

01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:52.990
from those voters that Arlie Hochschild

01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:55.403
was gonna be interviewing later.

01:09:57.215 --> 01:10:01.010
Lynn made the observation he
said, "The white over class,"

01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:02.800
and he was thinking here of sort of people

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.143
we might today characterize
as limousine liberals can,

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:10.683
live right and think left.

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:16.820
And so the thought here
was that affirmative action

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:19.027
has no real effect on the kind of people

01:10:19.027 --> 01:10:20.683
who live in Scarsdale.

01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:26.210
They can get advantages for
their sons and daughters.

01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:29.280
We're seeing one of the
scandals about how they do it

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.470
in college admissions
playing out right now.

01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:36.273
Lynn was saying this in
1995, very interesting book.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.420
But the real front line,
the real battles that effect

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:46.070
affirmative action are exactly
in places like promotions

01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:48.720
in the police department
and the fire department.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.080
And that's where

01:10:52.330 --> 01:10:55.717
people on the short end
of affirmative action say,

01:10:55.717 --> 01:10:58.187
"I never had slaves, I never did anything

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:00.787
"to discriminate against
African Americans.

01:11:00.787 --> 01:11:03.490
"Why am I not getting that promotion?"

01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:06.587
So this is, if you like, Lynn in 1995

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.260
already identifying the beginning

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:13.820
of this cutting in narrative.

01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:18.783
That feeds the sense of
grievance that drives

01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:24.070
the anger and resentment that Hochschild

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:26.890
and Cramer have documented.

01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:29.630
And, just to bring us right up to date,

01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:33.423
if you look at the Democratic primaries,

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:39.070
you know among the things
which they are talking about

01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:43.750
and fighting about are
questions about reparations.

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:45.880
Again, reparations is

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:53.490
an idea which produces
very divergent narratives.

01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:57.560
Some people see them as
absolutely morally compelling.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:02.040
Others see them including African American

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.030
left wing intellectuals
such as Adolf Reed, Jr.,

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:11.030
sees debates about reparations
as hugely destructive

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:16.330
of the possibility of
building the sort of alliances

01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:19.903
that could produce progressive change.

01:12:25.488 --> 01:12:28.180
Again, you're back in
this world of irreducibly

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:31.370
conflicting narratives that
are important to people

01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:35.080
in understanding themselves
and their identities.

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.910
And that motivate them in politics,

01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:41.810
even to the point where
perhaps they'll take positions

01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:46.810
that are self defeating from
a materialist point of view,

01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:50.470
or from an intraspace point of view.

01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:55.470
And that really is I think
the takeaway when we delve

01:12:56.170 --> 01:13:00.790
into this history and we
see the ways in which race

01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:04.230
has played out in American politics,

01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:09.230
it constantly feeds these
mutually incompatible narratives.

01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:14.910
And this is an important thing to know,

01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:19.370
because it's one of the ways
in which modernization theory

01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:23.480
got politics very badly wrong.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.090
To this point in this
course I've talked about

01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:28.820
modernization theory and democracy.

01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:31.040
That there were these
predictions that countries

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.740
would become more democratic
as they developed economically.

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:38.260
But there was another important prediction

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:42.820
of modernization theory,
which in some ways underlay

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:46.170
the prediction about democracy.

01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:49.680
And that was the prediction
that identity politics

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:54.680
would over time be displaced
by interest based politics.

01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:59.900
That things like religion and
race, and so on, would atrophy

01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:06.063
as sources as political mobilization.

01:14:07.290 --> 01:14:11.350
This is something about
which they couldn't

01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:13.063
have been more wrong.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:19.610
It's partly the prediction
that democracy would arise

01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:22.740
is that when you think
about divisible goods,

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:25.650
which is important for
the divided dollar game,

01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:27.600
and for democracy to work,

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.093
that is things like money and income.

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:34.310
Once you start talking
about identity politics,

01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:36.210
it's not about divisible goods,

01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:38.510
it's about a very
different kind of politics.

01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:41.210
It's about recognition, it's about status.

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:45.100
It's about telling moral
narratives that either

01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:48.820
validate you or humiliate you.

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:53.240
And so we have reached
a world in which we have

01:14:54.162 --> 01:14:58.460
these conflicting narratives
that are not easily reconciled,

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:00.670
even when they're about the same topic,

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:02.180
such as affirmative action,

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:05.273
or majority minority districts, or,

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.450
racial set asides of other sorts.

01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:14.090
You get these mutually
incompatible narratives.

01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:17.140
And what happened after 2016

01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:21.170
is that one of these became
weaponized, essentially.

01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:23.910
Trump found a way to weaponize

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:31.797
the narrative of cutting in,
that Hochschild had uncovered.

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:38.750
And that is the story of
the socioeconomic sources

01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:42.060
of populism as it's played out.

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:46.003
And we'll turn to the political
sources of it on Thursday.

01:15:49.293 --> 01:15:53.460

RONALD SMITH: Well, we
are now in the middle of a

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.233
section on global warming.

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:14.133
And we spent Friday looking at
how carbon dioxide levels have

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.533
changed in the atmosphere.

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.533
Are there any questions
on that before I go

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.800
onto the next subject?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.300
So we have a pretty good idea
of how--what kind of carbon

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.067
dioxide is being emitted, how
much is being emitted every

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:31.233
year into the atmosphere.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:34.467
How much of that is being
retained by the atmosphere.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.533
How those levels are growing.

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.933
We'll come back to that either
at the end of this lecture or

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:43.367
on Friday when we talk about
projections into the future.

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:47.333
Part of the business of
projections is to compute what

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.667
the carbon dioxide
levels will be.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:51.567
So we will return
to the subject.

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:54.833
Today I want to start off by
thinking of this recent period

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:59.900
the last 10,000 years called the
Holocene by geologists and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.667
investigating what kind of
climate change there's been

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.667
during that period,
and whether that

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:07.933
would serve as a reference.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.600
I doubt that there's
any perfect

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.500
reference for climate change.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.267
It's been changing all through
geologic history.

00:01:14.267 --> 00:01:18.033
But it's still worth I think
questioning whether or not the

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:22.200
Holocene might be a reasonable
choice as a reference for

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.667
looking at more recent
climate changes.

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:28.000
So I want to talk about that
to start with today.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.767
And basically, we start the
Holocene with that last large

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:36.667
set of ice sheets retreating.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:40.567
So the Laurentide ice sheet,
the Scandinavian ice sheets

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:45.867
retreating, the most rapid rate
of retreat was 12,000

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:47.800
years ago, 11,000 years ago.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.267
By the time you got to about
8,000 or 9,000 years ago, most

00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:53.067
of those ice sheets were gone.

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:55.933
And we're left with just the
big two that we have today

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:58.133
Greenland and Antarctica.

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:02.167
And then we're into what's
called the Holocene.

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:07.467
There was a period of relative
warmth called the Holocene

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:10.167
Optimum between 8,000
and 7,000 years ago.

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:12.300
And then much more recently
than that

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.267
Look, there's a time
notation shift.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:19.133
When I'm talking about dates
that are more recent, I'll

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:24.133
shift over to the B.C.,
A.D. type of calendar.

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:28.233
So a lot of climate change is
talked about in terms of years

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:31.633
before present, but then at some
point, we switch over to

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:33.767
a more modern date notation.

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:35.733
So be aware of that switch.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.533
So there was this period of time
centered on about 1,000

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:44.767
A.D. but lasting for a couple
hundred years called the

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.600
Medieval Warm Period.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.833
After that, the Little
Ice Age came along.

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:52.433
I want to talk briefly
today about the

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:53.433
Year Without a Summer.

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:57.167
And then the curious
change in notation.

00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:00.800
As the earth began to warm up
about 100 years ago when

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.133
climatologists studied this,
there was a kind of change of

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:07.900
attitude associated
with a change in

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.833
notation that was used.

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:13.267
And I'll talk about that
today, as well.

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:16.567
So first of all, then you've
seen this diagram before, I

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:21.000
think thousands of years before
present, coming out of

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.600
the last ice age, the heavy
curve is the average of a

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.133
bunch of different
glacial proxies.

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:29.033
And it's an anomaly.

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:32.400
So they've taken this period
through here as their

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.233
reference, and then everything
else is either colder than

00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:37.733
that or warmer than that.

00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:41.567
It's in degrees C, but not in
absolute degree Celsius.

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:44.633
It's not based on the
normal zero Celsius.

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:47.533
It's based instead on
taking this period

00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:48.667
of time as a reference.

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:53.267
So coming out of last ice age,
slightly warm period.

00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:56.300
Only a few tenths of
degrees warmer.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.033
Than cooling off after
that as we get closer

00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:01.400
to the present day.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.267
And I mentioned this, as well,
that different authors will

00:04:04.267 --> 00:04:09.100
plot this up in different ways
to make a different emphasis.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.033
And in this case, they show some
of the outlier proxies to

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:18.433
give you a little stronger
sense of the

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:20.033
Medieval Warm Period.

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:23.467
But in this data set, they
showed that variation as a

00:04:23.467 --> 00:04:29.767
grey background so you get
less of a sense of the

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:32.233
Holocene Optimum as being
an important feature.

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:34.367
Nevertheless, the data sets
are pretty much the same.

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:39.033
So the same data plotted just
with a choice of color

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:44.900
sometimes can give you a
slightly different sense of

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.267
what the climate's been doing.

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:53.700
So a word about this Medieval
Warm Period, then.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.733
Historians seem to agree that
this was a fairly big deal in

00:04:56.733 --> 00:04:59.233
Europe and in the Americas.

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:02.567
And it was a period when the
Vikings were able to leave

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:06.533
their homeland and travel west
across the Atlantic, setting

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:11.933
up villages, even farming on
the coast of Greenland.

00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:16.333
And this is a dwelling left
from that period of time.

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:18.533
It was abandoned, of course,
when we got into

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:21.167
the Little Ice Age.

00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:23.867
It became--the climate was
too cool to support those

00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:26.733
settlements, and the Vikings
disappeared from that area.

00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:31.467
It was also during that medieval
warm period, having

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:35.100
established these settlements
in Greenland, they were able

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.533
to then go the rest of the way
across the Atlantic and

00:05:39.533 --> 00:05:43.667
establish brief residences
up in Newfoundland.

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:47.467
Hence the belief that really
the Vikings discovered

00:05:47.467 --> 00:05:50.800
America, not Columbus.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.833
They were there, well
almost 500 years

00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:55.100
before Columbus came.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.967
But again, taking advantage of
this warm period of time to

00:05:59.967 --> 00:06:03.333
make that crossing.

00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:05.200
Then came the Little Ice age.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.267
1400 to 1800 roughly.

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:10.600
The historians will argue
forever about

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.400
what those dates are.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.433
It's impossible to set
definite dates.

00:06:14.433 --> 00:06:19.233
But a picture like this, a
painting by Bruegel from the

00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:23.133
1500s gives you a sense
that it was a colder

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.933
period of time in Europe.

00:06:25.933 --> 00:06:27.233
The Thames froze over.

00:06:27.233 --> 00:06:30.933
A lot of the rivers in Europe
froze over that don't freeze

00:06:30.933 --> 00:06:32.167
over today.

00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:35.367
And that was recorded in many
different ways, not only in

00:06:35.367 --> 00:06:39.800
art, but in many of the
economic and other

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.733
records of the time.

00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:47.567
Right at the end of that, there
was a curious event

00:06:47.567 --> 00:06:50.800
called the Year Without
a Summer.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.000
The year was 1816 and this was a
big event both in Europe and

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.900
in the Northeast
United States.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.033
There were several killing
frosts, at least one in each

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:08.900
of the summer months June, July,
and August. And so crops

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.200
that were planted died
in the frost,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.233
replanted, were frozen again.

00:07:15.233 --> 00:07:20.233
And so very little successful
agriculture was carried out in

00:07:20.233 --> 00:07:22.900
the Year Without
a Summer 1816.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.567
We think we know the
reason for that.

00:07:24.567 --> 00:07:27.767
One year before of course, we
were just coming out of the

00:07:27.767 --> 00:07:28.400
Little Ice Age.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.033
Remember, this year could even
have been included in our

00:07:32.033 --> 00:07:35.467
definition of the Little Ice Age
because it's so--the curve

00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:38.233
is so wiggly, so it's hard to
know where to draw the end.

00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:41.633
So this is right at the end
of the Little Ice Age.

00:07:41.633 --> 00:07:43.267
But there was an event
that caused

00:07:43.267 --> 00:07:45.100
that particular episode.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.300
And that was Mount Tambora
in Indonesia, with a huge

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.300
volcanic explosion, putting
dust into the atmosphere.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:08:00.167
A number of writers at the time
noted the red sunsets,

00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:06.100
the very unusually red sunsets
from all that scattering

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.100
material in the atmosphere.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.933
And as far as we know, that
was the largest volcanic

00:08:11.933 --> 00:08:16.467
explosion since 180 A.D. So
it'd been more than 1,000

00:08:16.467 --> 00:08:22.800
years since there'd been such
a large explosive volcanic

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.267
event on the earth,
as far as we know.

00:08:25.267 --> 00:08:27.800
So that really was a
remarkable event.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.700
Of course, what it does is put
dust into the stratosphere,

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.967
which increases the albedo
of the planet.

00:08:33.967 --> 00:08:36.833
And if you remember, the formula
we derived for the

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:40.733
temperature of the planet that
formula that had the fourth

00:08:40.733 --> 00:08:46.000
root of S times one minus the
albedo when the albedo is

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.533
larger, the planet cools.

00:08:50.533 --> 00:08:53.600
So that formula probably doesn't
give us a quantitative

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.533
way to understand it, but at
least it shows qualitatively

00:08:56.533 --> 00:08:59.767
that an increase in
reflectivity, caused by a

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:02.067
layer of dust in the
stratosphere,

00:09:02.067 --> 00:09:05.600
would cool the planet.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.800
The dust probably only lasts
three or four years, and then

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.567
the climate would quickly return
to normal after that.

00:09:14.567 --> 00:09:19.433
The prices of oats rose from
$0.12 to $0.92, which gives

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:22.700
you an idea of how well
agriculture was doing.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.600
And here in the USA, in New
England, which by that time

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.200
was pretty much continuous
agriculture if you drove

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.067
through New England, you found
very few trees at that time.

00:09:34.067 --> 00:09:38.433
It was mostly just open
agricultural lands.

00:09:38.433 --> 00:09:40.733
If you don't believe that, walk
through the forests of

00:09:40.733 --> 00:09:43.533
New England today.

00:09:43.533 --> 00:09:48.500
And as you walk on a trail,
every few minutes you'll come

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.200
across a stone fence, now all
deeply embedded in the

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.667
forests, which tells you that
150, 200 years ago all this

00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:02.333
forest land was broken up into
open farmland at the moment.

00:10:02.333 --> 00:10:04.333
And that was the case.

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:09.400
But then immediately after the
Year Without a Summer,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:15.133
migration of farmers to the
West began to occur.

00:10:15.133 --> 00:10:17.800
Not only because of this event,
but that's when new

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.733
lands are becoming open to
settlement in the Midwest, in

00:10:22.733 --> 00:10:26.400
the Ohio Valley, for example,
where the soils were better

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.100
than in New England.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.967
Because remember, the glaciers
had scraped all the topsoil

00:10:30.967 --> 00:10:36.333
off of New England, but not in
the Midwest. There were large

00:10:36.333 --> 00:10:39.400
areas where the glaciers did not
reach, and therefore they

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.233
had deep, high quality
top soils.

00:10:42.233 --> 00:10:44.900
And when those lands become
available, that was the draw.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.433
But the timing of these
migrations really

00:10:48.433 --> 00:10:52.400
accelerated in 1817.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.733
I know this from my own
family history.

00:10:54.733 --> 00:10:58.567
Because the Smith family at that
point had been farming up

00:10:58.567 --> 00:11:03.400
in Litchfield, CT for two
and a half generations.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.600
And in 1817, they were gone.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.433
They were headed west
to find new lands.

00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:12.367
I'm sure that this had
a big role in that.

00:11:12.367 --> 00:11:15.500
So this was a huge
event locally.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.600
People doubt that it had much
of an influence in the

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.867
southern hemisphere because
by the time those volcanic

00:11:23.867 --> 00:11:26.400
materials in the stratosphere
made their way into the

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.000
southern hemisphere their
density was pretty small.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.467
But for a northern hemisphere
event, it was large.

00:11:32.467 --> 00:11:34.133
And at that point, the
forest began to

00:11:34.133 --> 00:11:35.767
regrow in New England.

00:11:35.767 --> 00:11:39.133
So today New England in forest
covered, but at that point it

00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:40.433
was farmland.

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.900
Another little interesting
footnote is that Yale

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.267
president Timothy Dwight
kept some of the best

00:11:47.267 --> 00:11:49.133
daily weather records.

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:51.333
I haven't seen them myself,
but apparently they're in

00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:53.333
Beinecke Library somewhere.

00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:59.467
His daily hand written
temperature records throughout

00:11:59.467 --> 00:12:03.700
that event are there, and if
you're a historian interested

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.067
in that kind of thing,
you might want to

00:12:05.067 --> 00:12:06.600
go look those up.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.267
Because he's got--we have
excellent records here from

00:12:09.267 --> 00:12:12.433
New Haven on that event.

00:12:12.433 --> 00:12:13.667
Any questions there?

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:21.133
OK, so the Holocene had many
small regional or temporary

00:12:21.133 --> 00:12:21.967
climate events.

00:12:21.967 --> 00:12:25.100
But generally, global
temperature--and as we saw

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.033
earlier, sea levels--varied
quite little during that

00:12:29.033 --> 00:12:29.867
10,000 years.

00:12:29.867 --> 00:12:32.133
So in that sense, it's probably

00:12:32.133 --> 00:12:34.067
a pretty good reference.

00:12:34.067 --> 00:12:37.567
Also but a lot was going on
in terms of human history.

00:12:37.567 --> 00:12:41.467
Civilizations were rising and
falling during those 10,000

00:12:41.467 --> 00:12:46.033
years, so we saw a lot of human
change in the way they

00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:49.600
lived and structured their
societies in this relatively

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.133
constant period of time.

00:12:51.133 --> 00:12:54.267
Perhaps it is the best reference
for later climate

00:12:54.267 --> 00:12:57.733
change, but I think it's
quite open to argument.

00:12:57.733 --> 00:13:01.167
I won't make the point
too strongly there.

00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:04.433
Any questions about
the Holocene?

00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:05.300
Yes.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.033
STUDENT: You said that the
Little Ice Ages was mostly in

00:13:08.033 --> 00:13:08.800
Europe and North America?

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.767
Why would it have
just been in--?

00:13:10.767 --> 00:13:13.533
PROFESSOR: Well, let
me say this the evidence for

00:13:13.533 --> 00:13:14.933
it comes mostly from those.

00:13:14.933 --> 00:13:17.467
And of course, the evidence has
to do with where people

00:13:17.467 --> 00:13:18.667
were living.

00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:26.100
And we didn't have people making
written records of crop

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.267
prices and so on.

00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:32.333
The Indians in the western
US weren't doing that.

00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:33.167
There were other cultures.

00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:37.667
So I hesitate to say that it was
only in Europe and North

00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:40.433
America, but I hate to--I don't
want to make that point.

00:13:40.433 --> 00:13:42.033
I think it's largely
an issue of record,

00:13:42.033 --> 00:13:43.967
where we had good records.

00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:48.667
But you can look for other
sources on that point.

00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:51.733
But I think the main thing is we
only had good records from

00:13:51.733 --> 00:13:55.333
Europe and North America.

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:57.000
So now we're going
to turn to this.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.700
And you're quite familiar with
this kind of curve from the

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.267
data sets you've been plotting
up for the lab.

00:14:04.267 --> 00:14:08.167
And starting in 1880, this shows
a temperature anomaly.

00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:12.467
So again, a mean value perhaps
roughly here has been

00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:17.800
separated out to make data
points earlier than 1940

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.733
appear negative, and ones after
that appear positive.

00:14:22.733 --> 00:14:28.867
And it's curious because we seem
to have a roughly flat

00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:30.967
period of climate.

00:14:30.967 --> 00:14:33.467
Then a rapid increase
to the 1940s.

00:14:33.467 --> 00:14:37.333
Then either flat or maybe
even a slight decrease.

00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:40.667
And then a really rapid
increase since then.

00:14:40.667 --> 00:14:45.867
And now very often you'll find
in the global warming skeptic

00:14:45.867 --> 00:14:51.500
literature the point made and
it's a good one, but I'll

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:57.333
address it that the carbon
dioxide rise has been much

00:14:57.333 --> 00:14:59.200
smoother than that.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.167
OK, you get the annual cycle due
to uptake by forests and

00:15:04.167 --> 00:15:08.567
oceans, but generally the
CO2 rise has been much

00:15:08.567 --> 00:15:09.733
more smooth than this.

00:15:09.733 --> 00:15:15.400
And so if the two are causally
related, why do the curves

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.533
resemble each other so poorly?

00:15:17.533 --> 00:15:19.833
They're both rising, but they
have different structures.

00:15:19.833 --> 00:15:22.567
I'll address that just a minute,
but we do want to come

00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:26.333
up with some explanation for
this kind of irregularity in

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:27.367
the growth--

00:15:27.367 --> 00:15:32.033
in the increase in temperature
during the 20th century.

00:15:32.033 --> 00:15:35.767
And the total amount of
increase, if you go from, say,

00:15:35.767 --> 00:15:42.933
minus 0.3, let's say, up to plus
0.5 or 0.6, that total

00:15:42.933 --> 00:15:46.967
increase has been about
0.8.--0.7, 0.8,

00:15:46.967 --> 00:15:49.200
or 0.9 degrees Celsius.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.567
Something less than one
degree Celsius over

00:15:53.567 --> 00:15:57.000
that period of time.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.533
And as you know from the data
sets, when you combine the

00:16:01.533 --> 00:16:06.133
land and the ocean, you wash out
the fact there's a pretty

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:08.267
big difference between
the land record

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:09.633
and the ocean record.

00:16:09.633 --> 00:16:13.633
The land record is much noisier
and there's more

00:16:13.633 --> 00:16:15.267
overall increase.

00:16:15.267 --> 00:16:18.633
The ocean record is much
smoother less year to year

00:16:18.633 --> 00:16:22.900
variation and less
trend with time.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.600
So be aware that you're hiding
a lot of information when you

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.700
sum together these things.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.367
There's extra information to
be gained by looking at the

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:36.467
continents and the oceans
separately.

00:16:36.467 --> 00:16:40.600
The terminology I want to
point you to here I came

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.167
across this in the climatology
literature, reading books from

00:16:43.167 --> 00:16:51.367
the 1940s and 50s where they
were commenting on this rise,

00:16:51.367 --> 00:16:55.500
but they refer to it as quote,
"the recent amelioration of

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.800
climate."

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.667
What they were thinking
was they were aware of

00:16:58.667 --> 00:16:59.467
the Little Ice Age.

00:16:59.467 --> 00:17:01.100
That was already in
the literature.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.500
They were considering this
warming to be a beneficial

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.300
thing because it was taking
us back to a more pleasant

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.967
climate coming out of
the Little Ice Age.

00:17:10.967 --> 00:17:14.967
It wasn't till we got to about
1970 and 1980 that this new

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.133
term global warming
was coined.

00:17:17.133 --> 00:17:19.867
And now, of course, that's
what's used to describe a

00:17:19.867 --> 00:17:21.133
curve like this.

00:17:21.133 --> 00:17:23.800
And there's a different
implication, though, isn't

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.833
there in those two terms?

00:17:24.833 --> 00:17:27.900
Global warming suggests that
this is something that's maybe

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.867
a little unusual not just
returning to a more normal

00:17:31.867 --> 00:17:35.133
state, but actually taking us
into a new kind of climate

00:17:35.133 --> 00:17:36.667
zone we hadn't seen before.

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:41.933
And the word global in the
phrase global warming is a

00:17:41.933 --> 00:17:46.467
little problematic I think,
too I mentioned it here

00:17:46.467 --> 00:17:50.433
because I think it tends to
overstate the uniformity of

00:17:50.433 --> 00:17:51.000
the warming.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.133
If you look at the global
temperature trends 1979 to

00:17:56.133 --> 00:18:03.300
2005, for example, which covers
basically this part

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:09.333
here so here it is at the
surface of the earth, and here

00:18:09.333 --> 00:18:13.233
it is estimates for
the troposphere.

00:18:13.233 --> 00:18:15.867
First of all, there's much more
warming on the continents

00:18:15.867 --> 00:18:17.533
than over the ocean.

00:18:17.533 --> 00:18:19.967
There's much more warming in the
northern hemisphere than

00:18:19.967 --> 00:18:21.433
the southern hemisphere.

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:22.500
There's more warming
in the high

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.133
latitudes than in low latitudes.

00:18:25.133 --> 00:18:29.233
So one danger in this term
global warming is that it

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:33.833
makes you think that the warming
is somehow uniform

00:18:33.833 --> 00:18:35.367
over the globe, and that's
not the case.

00:18:35.367 --> 00:18:42.167
If you had a 20 room mansion
kind of a silly analogy but if

00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:45.300
you had a 20 room mansion and
you went to one of the rooms

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.233
and turned the thermostat way
up so that room became warm

00:18:49.233 --> 00:18:52.033
and none of the others changed,
it wouldn't be very

00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:54.967
useful or accurate to say,
well, that house

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:57.500
is now warmer inside.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.533
It'd be true the average
temperature of all the rooms

00:19:00.533 --> 00:19:03.933
has increased, but that's a
very poor description of

00:19:03.933 --> 00:19:05.733
what's actually happened
when you've just

00:19:05.733 --> 00:19:07.100
increased one room.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.067
Well, that's too strong of an
analogy to apply to here

00:19:10.067 --> 00:19:12.300
there's been warming
lots of places.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.267
But I don't think you can say
that it's been globally

00:19:14.267 --> 00:19:15.733
uniform, either.

00:19:15.733 --> 00:19:18.100
So be a little bit careful, when
you hear this word global

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.000
warming, that there's a
lot of inhomogeneity.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.567
The land warms more than the
ocean, the northern hemisphere

00:19:24.567 --> 00:19:27.500
more than the southern
hemisphere.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.467
It's a little more uniform
when you look up in the

00:19:29.467 --> 00:19:32.900
troposphere, in the air in the
first 10 or 20 kilometers of

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.667
the atmosphere.

00:19:33.667 --> 00:19:35.733
But still there's some
variation there.

00:19:35.733 --> 00:19:40.167
And even some regions that
have cooled over

00:19:40.167 --> 00:19:42.133
that period of time.

00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:43.367
Questions on that?

00:19:45.867 --> 00:19:47.900
So what else?

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.733
We talked a lot about carbon
dioxide, but what else may

00:19:50.733 --> 00:19:55.900
have influenced the climate
of the 20th century?

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:01.133
These two large volcanic
explosions in our own era.

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:03.700
Forget about Tambora
back in 1815.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.267
In the 20th century we had
these two large ones.

00:20:06.267 --> 00:20:08.800
El Chichon in Mexico,
April, 1982.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.300
There's a picture of it.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.833
And Pinatubo in the Philippines
in 1991.

00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:13.733
There's a picture of it.

00:20:13.733 --> 00:20:16.133
That material, some of it
carried up into the

00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:17.933
stratosphere.

00:20:17.933 --> 00:20:21.567
The winds quickly carried it
around the globe only takes a

00:20:21.567 --> 00:20:24.833
few days to get it distributed
around the globe and then

00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:27.767
those dust particles stayed up
there for a couple of years,

00:20:27.767 --> 00:20:32.167
and, as we'll see, did cause
a temporary cooling in the

00:20:32.167 --> 00:20:34.800
climate connected with
those two things.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:41.633
Here is from that same Mauna
Loa Observatory on the big

00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:44.267
island of Hawaii where they
were measuring CO2.

00:20:44.267 --> 00:20:46.200
They also measure atmospheric
transmission.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.933
You have a telescope looks right
at the sun and measures

00:20:50.933 --> 00:20:53.400
the intensity of the radiation
coming from the sun.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.967
And when that dips, that's
usually because some dust has

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:01.733
come between you and the sun.

00:21:01.733 --> 00:21:05.533
And notice these dips connected
with both El Chichon

00:21:05.533 --> 00:21:06.667
and Pinatubo.

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:09.800
So we know that had an influence
on atmospheric

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.167
transmissivity, transmittance,
and probably on albedo, as

00:21:15.167 --> 00:21:17.300
well, the fraction of
sunlight that was

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.400
reflected back to space.

00:21:23.067 --> 00:21:25.267
The other big thing that
was going on along with

00:21:25.267 --> 00:21:33.033
industrialization was sulfur
dioxide emissions into the

00:21:33.033 --> 00:21:38.533
earth's atmosphere, mostly from
coal fired power plants.

00:21:38.533 --> 00:21:42.033
Coal typically has quite
a bit of sulfur in it.

00:21:42.033 --> 00:21:46.967
And when you burn coal with
sulfur, you produce SO2.

00:21:46.967 --> 00:21:52.633
And the SO2 will often, after
it's been emitted, it will

00:21:52.633 --> 00:21:55.333
react further chemically
to form small

00:21:55.333 --> 00:21:58.733
particles, sulfate particles.

00:21:58.733 --> 00:22:01.333
And those particles are a
primary source of air

00:22:01.333 --> 00:22:06.233
pollution, a primary cause of
lack of visibility in the

00:22:06.233 --> 00:22:12.033
atmosphere, and they reflect
sunlight back to space just

00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:18.000
like those volcanic explosion
plumes would.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.400
So that peaked in about
well, there are

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.833
various sources here.

00:22:21.833 --> 00:22:25.600
This is organized
by continent.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.800
And North America is the
maroon color here.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.567
East and Central Asia I
think is the yellow.

00:22:34.567 --> 00:22:37.733
But anyway, we all
were synchronous.

00:22:37.733 --> 00:22:41.033
And it peaked in about 1880--

00:22:41.033 --> 00:22:44.900
1980 or 1990 and then slowly
begin to decrease.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:49.400
Not because coal was being used
less, but because by that

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.267
point, in the US first and then
in Europe, we had passed

00:22:54.267 --> 00:22:57.200
the Clean Air Act.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.700
And the Clean Air Act didn't
immediately shut down coal

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.433
power plants by no means did it
to do that but it required

00:23:04.433 --> 00:23:08.633
that they put scrubbers on the
smokestacks to remove the

00:23:08.633 --> 00:23:12.567
sulfate from getting emitted
into the atmosphere.

00:23:12.567 --> 00:23:14.433
And we see that as
this beginning of

00:23:14.433 --> 00:23:17.667
the decline in CO2--

00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:20.767
SO2 emissions into
the atmosphere.

00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:24.233
So we should watch for this
and see whether it has an

00:23:24.233 --> 00:23:30.200
impact on the climate
of the 20th century.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.067
So here's one of the it's not a
great way, but it's a pretty

00:23:34.067 --> 00:23:37.367
good way to look at the
influences of these different

00:23:37.367 --> 00:23:39.067
inputs into the atmosphere.

00:23:39.067 --> 00:23:40.333
So these are model runs.

00:23:40.333 --> 00:23:45.700
These are computer simulations
of climate done by a number of

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.267
different laboratories.

00:23:47.267 --> 00:23:49.467
Every one of these curves
is a different

00:23:49.467 --> 00:23:51.067
global circulation model.

00:23:51.067 --> 00:23:52.900
One of these is at the
National Center for

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.433
Atmospheric Research.

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:57.133
The Department of
Energy has one.

00:23:57.133 --> 00:23:59.533
NOAA has one.

00:23:59.533 --> 00:24:01.033
The Germans have one.

00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:03.433
There's one in the UK.

00:24:03.433 --> 00:24:07.533
So many GCMs are in this
business of trying to model

00:24:07.533 --> 00:24:12.000
climate and how it changes with
these different inputs.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.533
The time scale is 1900
to about 2010 or so.

00:24:17.533 --> 00:24:20.000
Temperature anomaly
is plotted.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.300
Again, some period of time has
been used as a reference, and

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.733
that reference temperature
has been subtracted.

00:24:26.733 --> 00:24:29.233
The different models are shown
in yellow, all the different

00:24:29.233 --> 00:24:32.600
curves scribbled together.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.633
The average of all the models
is shown in red.

00:24:35.633 --> 00:24:40.467
And the observations, similar to
what I just showed you back

00:24:40.467 --> 00:24:46.667
here, that is basically, with
that characteristic peak in

00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:53.633
around 1940, is shown
in the black.

00:24:53.633 --> 00:24:59.533
So how well do the models do in
predicting the climate of

00:24:59.533 --> 00:25:02.100
the 20th century?

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.467
They don't get that peak.

00:25:04.467 --> 00:25:08.833
They do, however, get the drops
in temperature connected

00:25:08.833 --> 00:25:12.500
with Agung, El Chichon,
and Pinatubo.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.867
But that comes through because
the modelers are putting in

00:25:15.867 --> 00:25:20.533
those inputs into the model,
those increases in dust. They

00:25:20.533 --> 00:25:22.300
also get the general
upward trend.

00:25:24.967 --> 00:25:29.767
And they get this flat
period here before it

00:25:29.767 --> 00:25:31.400
begins to rise rapidly.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.567
So the models do pretty well
by putting in the CO2

00:25:34.567 --> 00:25:40.033
forcings, the sulfate aerosol,
and the volcanic eruptions.

00:25:40.033 --> 00:25:42.200
However, let's see how well
they do when some of these

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.467
things are left out.

00:25:43.467 --> 00:25:46.800
By the way, this is from the
IPCC report, so this is

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:51.033
accessible to you easily,
these kinds of plots.

00:25:51.033 --> 00:25:59.133
Here's the same set of models,
but they've put in natural

00:25:59.133 --> 00:26:00.067
forcings only.

00:26:00.067 --> 00:26:01.167
What does that mean?

00:26:01.167 --> 00:26:06.400
That means the volcanic
eruptions are put in, but the

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.333
sulfate and the CO2
is left out.

00:26:11.333 --> 00:26:12.567
Those are both anthropogenic.

00:26:15.267 --> 00:26:18.767
So the model continues to
capture the drops connected

00:26:18.767 --> 00:26:21.733
with volcanic input, because
that's included in what they

00:26:21.733 --> 00:26:24.367
call natural forcing.

00:26:24.367 --> 00:26:28.867
But it shows basically a flat
and even cooling climate after

00:26:28.867 --> 00:26:35.867
1940, and missing entirely this
increase that was caused

00:26:35.867 --> 00:26:40.567
well, the decrease here caused
by the sulfates, and then the

00:26:40.567 --> 00:26:44.600
increase caused by the eventual
dominance of the CO2.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:50.767
So I don't like models as a way
to prove things, but they

00:26:50.767 --> 00:26:54.800
are--they do give us a clue
that these inputs are

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.767
important, and some of these
inputs are anthropogenic.

00:26:59.767 --> 00:27:01.067
Questions on these curves?

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.533
I've included in the PowerPoint
presentation this

00:27:06.533 --> 00:27:09.500
big legend which goes with
those last two curves.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.867
If you're looking at it and want
to get the legend, you'll

00:27:11.867 --> 00:27:13.133
find it there.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:22.300
This is the same sort of thing
applied continent by

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:27.700
continent, global, global
land, and global ocean.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:32.033
And in each case the blue
is models using

00:27:32.033 --> 00:27:33.400
only natural forcings.

00:27:35.967 --> 00:27:42.033
And the reddish one is models
using anthropogenic forcings.

00:27:42.033 --> 00:27:45.033
And the difference is dramatic,
especially in

00:27:45.033 --> 00:27:49.733
regards to this most recent
rise since 1975.

00:27:49.733 --> 00:27:53.033
So the models seem to be giving
a consistent view in

00:27:53.033 --> 00:27:56.500
that it's these anthropogenic
things, especially CO2, that's

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.100
causing the final rise there.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.333
Are there questions
on these plots?

00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:01.533
Yes.

00:28:01.533 --> 00:28:08.733
STUDENT: I have a question about
the sulfur particles.

00:28:08.733 --> 00:28:14.267
Do those increase the albedo of
the atmosphere before they

00:28:14.267 --> 00:28:15.533
chemically react?

00:28:18.833 --> 00:28:19.767
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.

00:28:19.767 --> 00:28:23.367
So the gas that's
emitted is SO2.

00:28:23.367 --> 00:28:24.233
In the atmosphere they're

00:28:24.233 --> 00:28:27.200
converted to sulfate particles.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.733
And then that does put a haze
in the atmosphere that not

00:28:31.733 --> 00:28:34.500
only limits your visibility
when you're trying to see

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.433
through the atmosphere, but
also reflects sunlight.

00:28:36.433 --> 00:28:37.367
So that's the point.

00:28:37.367 --> 00:28:40.833
It increases the albedo of the
earth, decreases the fraction

00:28:40.833 --> 00:28:43.833
of the sun's radiation that is
absorbed by the earth, and

00:28:43.833 --> 00:28:45.500
therefore cools the climate.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.200
That's the idea behind this.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.067
We think that's been responsible
for this decline

00:28:52.067 --> 00:28:58.967
through here, partly masking
the effect of CO2 rise.

00:28:58.967 --> 00:28:59.933
That's the curious thing.

00:28:59.933 --> 00:29:05.500
It seems like one thing we did
to the atmosphere putting CO2

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:09.800
warmed the climate, another
thing we did putting SO2 in

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.200
has cooled the climate.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.400
And for a number of years, the
SO2 actually won, or at least

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.833
the two were balancing
each other.

00:29:16.833 --> 00:29:21.633
But now that we've begun to
decrease the SO2 input by the

00:29:21.633 --> 00:29:25.900
Clean Air Act, now the CO2 is
dominant and the climate is

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.900
warming rapidly.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:33.167
That's what we think is going
on for the 20th century.

00:29:33.167 --> 00:29:35.533
It's curious, isn't it,
that these two things

00:29:35.533 --> 00:29:39.133
balanced in that way?

00:29:39.133 --> 00:29:43.067
Other comments or questions
on that?

00:29:43.067 --> 00:29:43.467
OK.

00:29:43.467 --> 00:29:46.533
So very short slide, then.

00:29:46.533 --> 00:29:49.400
The factors that seem to have
the biggest influence on 20th

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.900
century climate.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.233
The rise in carbon
dioxide level.

00:29:53.233 --> 00:29:55.533
Sulfate emissions from
coal burning.

00:29:55.533 --> 00:29:56.700
Major volcanic eruptions.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.833
Oh, and I should have added
also heat storage.

00:29:58.833 --> 00:30:03.800
Because as you saw from your
data, the oceans are warming

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:10.600
less than the continents, and
because the winds are

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.400
transporting heat back and forth
between the continents

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.700
and the oceans, the oceans are
probably limiting the rate of

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.300
warming of the continents
to some extent, as well.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.233
The point is the oceans have
such a large heat storage

00:30:23.233 --> 00:30:27.233
capacity that even though we're
doing these things to

00:30:27.233 --> 00:30:31.100
the climate, in order to warm
up the earth, you've got to

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.767
warm up the oceans first. And
they have such a large heat

00:30:34.767 --> 00:30:37.467
capacity that that's going to
limit the amount of heating

00:30:37.467 --> 00:30:41.300
you can get because of that
heat storage effect.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.933
That's going to give
you a lag.

00:30:42.933 --> 00:30:45.767
Whatever you do that might cause
the temperature of the

00:30:45.767 --> 00:30:49.467
planet to change, it's going to
be lagged because of that

00:30:49.467 --> 00:30:52.333
enormous heat storage capacity
in the ocean.

00:30:58.033 --> 00:31:03.933
One way to understand what's
going on over the last 100 or

00:31:03.933 --> 00:31:07.567
so years is to look at the
radiative forcings.

00:31:07.567 --> 00:31:11.200
This is, again, from
the IPCC report.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.867
Radiative forcing is defined as
the excess radiation coming

00:31:16.867 --> 00:31:23.333
down to the surface of the
earth over--since the

00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:24.333
industrial revolution.

00:31:24.333 --> 00:31:28.400
Let's say, over the last
100 or 150 years.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.400
And it could be either
long wave forcing

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.167
or short wave forcing.

00:31:37.067 --> 00:31:38.233
And here's how--we'll be coming
back and talk about

00:31:38.233 --> 00:31:39.033
this diagram again.

00:31:39.033 --> 00:31:42.533
It's a famous diagram you see
it often in arguments on

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:44.100
global warming.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.133
But they give here, for example,
the radiative forcing

00:31:48.133 --> 00:31:51.700
in watts per square meter caused
by the CO2 increase

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.267
over that period of time.

00:31:53.267 --> 00:31:57.633
It's about 1.5 watts
per square meter.

00:31:57.633 --> 00:31:59.267
That's a long wave
forcing, right?

00:31:59.267 --> 00:32:03.267
So that's radiation from the
earth's surface gone up to the

00:32:03.267 --> 00:32:06.767
atmosphere, been absorbed, and
been reemitted back down to

00:32:06.767 --> 00:32:11.533
the earth's surface as thermal
infrared radiation.

00:32:11.533 --> 00:32:13.333
That's that one.

00:32:13.333 --> 00:32:15.333
There are some other greenhouse
gases that have

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:18.433
been increasing over that
same period of time.

00:32:18.433 --> 00:32:23.933
It includes methane, N2O,
and some halocarbons.

00:32:23.933 --> 00:32:28.733
And that is perhaps another
watt per square meter.

00:32:28.733 --> 00:32:34.267
Ozone has been increasing
slightly in the troposphere.

00:32:34.267 --> 00:32:37.767
Not as important as the others,
but maybe 0.3 watts

00:32:37.767 --> 00:32:39.900
per square meter.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.600
At the same time there have
been these aerosol effects

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.167
from the burning of coal, giving
sulfate particles in

00:32:47.167 --> 00:32:48.100
the atmosphere.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.633
And that's tended to cool the
climate significantly.

00:32:51.633 --> 00:32:56.633
If you add all these up, you get
total net anthropogenic.

00:32:56.633 --> 00:32:59.933
The greenhouse gases dominate,
but the aerosols

00:32:59.933 --> 00:33:00.900
partly reduce this.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.333
If I added up these three,
they'd be out to here or so.

00:33:04.333 --> 00:33:07.733
Instead, the net's
only about 1.5.

00:33:07.733 --> 00:33:12.267
So there's been a partial
cancellation between the

00:33:12.267 --> 00:33:14.867
anthropogenic effects from
putting greenhouse gases into

00:33:14.867 --> 00:33:17.467
the atmosphere and the
anthropogenic effects from

00:33:17.467 --> 00:33:22.167
putting sulfate and aerosols
into the atmosphere.

00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:25.833
Giving a net radiative forcing
over the last 100 years of

00:33:25.833 --> 00:33:31.267
about one and a half watts per
square meter excess radiation

00:33:31.267 --> 00:33:34.433
reaching the surface of the
earth, mostly in the form of

00:33:34.433 --> 00:33:35.933
long wave infrared radiation.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.000
Before we leave the subject of
the last 100 years, let's look

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.233
at some of the other things that
have been changing over

00:33:45.233 --> 00:33:46.333
that period of time.

00:33:46.333 --> 00:33:47.600
Sea level has been rising.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:55.533
Not as rapidly as it did as we
came out of the last ice age,

00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:57.967
but still rising.

00:33:57.967 --> 00:34:03.533
The rate here is about three
centimeters per decade.

00:34:03.533 --> 00:34:06.767
So every 10 that goes
by, we raise sea

00:34:06.767 --> 00:34:09.600
level about that much.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.167
It's been pretty steady.

00:34:12.167 --> 00:34:17.033
And our estimates are that this
is approximately half due

00:34:17.033 --> 00:34:22.100
to the melting of glaciers
putting more water into the

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:27.033
ocean basins, and the other half
is due to the warming of

00:34:27.033 --> 00:34:30.467
the water that's already in the
oceans when you warm water

00:34:30.467 --> 00:34:34.833
you make it expand, and so the
top of the ocean rises a

00:34:34.833 --> 00:34:38.367
little bit because you've
increased the volume of the

00:34:38.367 --> 00:34:41.133
existing water in the oceans.

00:34:41.133 --> 00:34:47.167
So each has contributed about
half to this total increase.

00:34:47.167 --> 00:34:48.433
Any questions on that?

00:34:51.967 --> 00:34:55.567
Your problem set gave you a
couple chances to work out

00:34:55.567 --> 00:34:57.167
some estimates of that.

00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:05.900
There's another curious result
of the warming, of the CO2

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.867
addition, that I wanted
to point out you.

00:35:07.867 --> 00:35:09.933
Adding CO2 to the atmosphere
increases

00:35:09.933 --> 00:35:11.700
the greenhouse effect.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.700
We know that.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:17.500
It absorbs outgoing long wave
radiation and then re-emits it

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.700
back down to the surface,
causing a

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.967
warming of the surface.

00:35:20.967 --> 00:35:24.200
But adding CO2 to
the stratosphere

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.167
does something different.

00:35:26.167 --> 00:35:28.967
Because it's a greenhouse
gas, it can radiate.

00:35:28.967 --> 00:35:32.833
And it tends to radiate more
energy to space than was going

00:35:32.833 --> 00:35:36.300
on before you added
that extra CO2.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.500
So the models tell us this.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.733
We knew this was going
to happen.

00:35:39.733 --> 00:35:43.500
But the data confirms that the
result of adding CO2 to the

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.200
atmosphere, while it warms the
troposphere and the surface of

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.067
the earth, it cools
the stratosphere.

00:35:53.433 --> 00:35:58.267
This is sometimes referred to as
a line of evidence known as

00:35:58.267 --> 00:36:00.067
fingerprint evidence.

00:36:00.067 --> 00:36:04.567
In other words, if you change
CO2 and the models tell you

00:36:04.567 --> 00:36:08.533
something about the nature of
that change like warming the

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:11.933
troposphere and cooling the
stratosphere and then you see

00:36:11.933 --> 00:36:14.767
that happening in the
data, that tends to

00:36:14.767 --> 00:36:19.400
confirm those theories.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.700
Let's look at the data.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.167
This is, again, with
a mean removed.

00:36:25.167 --> 00:36:29.467
These are degrees
C departures.

00:36:29.467 --> 00:36:34.633
The time schedule is from 1980
to 2010, and it's for

00:36:34.633 --> 00:36:37.033
stratospheric temperatures.

00:36:37.033 --> 00:36:41.933
And indeed, you find some sudden
warmings connected with

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:44.533
those volcanic explosions.

00:36:44.533 --> 00:36:47.167
If you look at those two dates,
they correspond to El

00:36:47.167 --> 00:36:48.933
Chichon and Pinatubo.

00:36:48.933 --> 00:36:55.933
But generally there's been a
cooling of the stratosphere in

00:36:55.933 --> 00:36:58.500
rough agreement with what the
models would predict for

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.467
adding CO2 to the atmosphere.

00:37:00.467 --> 00:37:03.567
So if someone says, well,
we're not getting global

00:37:03.567 --> 00:37:06.167
warming because the stratosphere
is cooling, well,

00:37:06.167 --> 00:37:07.367
that's true.

00:37:07.367 --> 00:37:08.733
The stratosphere has been
cooling over the

00:37:08.733 --> 00:37:10.367
last 20 or 30 years.

00:37:10.367 --> 00:37:14.333
But that doesn't negate the fact
that the troposphere and

00:37:14.333 --> 00:37:17.100
the surface of the earth have
been warming over that same

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.333
period of time.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.967
Another thing that I noticed
this fall and I commented on

00:37:24.967 --> 00:37:27.900
it a few days ago it seems like
the leaves are falling

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:33.233
off the trees later and
later each year.

00:37:33.233 --> 00:37:36.333
Here's a study that was
done in Indiana.

00:37:36.333 --> 00:37:37.600
And they've got--

00:37:39.733 --> 00:37:41.967
the year is plotted
on the x-axis.

00:37:41.967 --> 00:37:45.567
1998 to 2008.

00:37:45.567 --> 00:37:49.667
And on the y-axis is and this
one is the day of year.

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:52.667
DOY means day of year.

00:37:52.667 --> 00:37:55.467
So January 1 is day one.

00:37:55.467 --> 00:37:58.933
December 31 is day 365.

00:37:58.933 --> 00:38:01.733
And it's a way to keep track of
where you are in the year

00:38:01.733 --> 00:38:05.600
without using months and dates
and things like that, just a

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.833
straight day of year.

00:38:06.833 --> 00:38:08.900
This shows two measures.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:14.467
One is they measured the net
carbon uptake by this forest.

00:38:14.467 --> 00:38:16.967
And the other is they looked
at the forest and gave it a

00:38:16.967 --> 00:38:18.367
greenness index.

00:38:18.367 --> 00:38:21.300
How green do the
leaves appear.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:28.667
So here's the start of the
deciduous growing cycle.

00:38:28.667 --> 00:38:35.500
Based on carbon uptake, it was
about year 115 or 118, and it

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:40.267
stayed relatively flat over
this decade of study.

00:38:40.267 --> 00:38:43.267
According to the greenness index
it started a little bit

00:38:43.267 --> 00:38:46.800
earlier, but it was also
flat during the 10

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.800
year period of time.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.300
But if you look at the end, if
you look at the fall season

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:56.133
day of year 260, 280, 300
you see a real trend.

00:38:56.133 --> 00:39:00.500
So the forests are keeping
their carbon uptake going

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:05.633
longer, their leaves aren't
changing from green to colored

00:39:05.633 --> 00:39:10.967
until later, and that slope in
both ways of measuring it by

00:39:10.967 --> 00:39:15.600
carbon uptake or by greenness
index is about

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.867
three days per year.

00:39:18.867 --> 00:39:22.300
In other words, every year,
three days later.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.100
That's an enormous change.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:28.333
So that over the 10 year period
of study, there's been

00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:38.633
about a 20 day --20 or
30 day delay in this.

00:39:38.633 --> 00:39:41.000
And of course if you subtract
one from the other to get the

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.433
length of the growing season for
the trees, that has pretty

00:39:44.433 --> 00:39:47.233
much the same trend as the fall
because the trend in the

00:39:47.233 --> 00:39:48.567
spring is pretty small.

00:39:48.567 --> 00:39:54.500
So that's a pretty dramatic
change in these mid-latitude

00:39:54.500 --> 00:40:00.500
forests to see them extending
their green season so strongly

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:04.733
over the last 10 years or so.

00:40:04.733 --> 00:40:07.800
Any questions on that?

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.200
So some of the observed changes
over the last--over

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.000
the 20th century.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.967
Warming largest in the
northern hemisphere

00:40:15.967 --> 00:40:17.600
continents.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:21.800
Global warming of about
0.8 degrees Celsius.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.833
Earlier in the course we've
talked about the arctic sea

00:40:24.833 --> 00:40:25.400
ice reduction.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.433
But remember, the antarctic
ice hasn't changed.

00:40:28.433 --> 00:40:32.300
The antarctic sea ice
hasn't changed.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:34.867
Most of the mountain glaciers
are in retreat.

00:40:34.867 --> 00:40:37.633
We talked earlier about the
Greenland ice sheet

00:40:37.633 --> 00:40:39.467
reducing its mass.

00:40:39.467 --> 00:40:42.233
Sea level rise I showed
you that diagram here.

00:40:42.233 --> 00:40:45.133
Stratospheric cooling,
and the deciduous

00:40:45.133 --> 00:40:47.233
growing season is longer.

00:40:47.233 --> 00:40:51.567
So all those changes have been
noted over the 20th century,

00:40:51.567 --> 00:40:59.833
especially over the last
25 or 30 years or so.

00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:04.900
Well, this has not stayed in
the scientific community,

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.333
these issues.

00:41:06.333 --> 00:41:09.167
You read about global warming
today everywhere.

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:13.667
And I had great fun spent a
few hours over the weekend

00:41:13.667 --> 00:41:16.400
pulling down current global
warming cartoons.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.833
It's a whole genre now.

00:41:17.833 --> 00:41:20.233
I mean, you could write
a PhD thesis about

00:41:20.233 --> 00:41:23.933
global warming cartoons.

00:41:23.933 --> 00:41:27.000
So, "remind me again why we
should care about global

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.467
warming."

00:41:29.467 --> 00:41:34.533
Scientists have been accused of
jumping on a global warming

00:41:34.533 --> 00:41:39.767
bandwagon and not being afraid
to say anything opposed to the

00:41:39.767 --> 00:41:40.633
idea of global warming.

00:41:40.633 --> 00:41:43.633
And this cartoon tends
to get that across.

00:41:46.167 --> 00:41:48.700
The poor scientist here
being tortured.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.933
Says. "OK, OK!

00:41:49.933 --> 00:41:52.067
I believe mankind causes global

00:41:52.067 --> 00:41:54.033
warming." And, "very well.

00:41:54.033 --> 00:41:55.400
Give him back his
research funds."

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.100
So the idea was that there's
somebody out there that was

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:02.300
insisting that we all believe in
global warming in order to

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.300
get our research funded.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.367
Which I don't think has been the
case, at least not to my

00:42:07.367 --> 00:42:10.167
knowledge and experience.

00:42:10.167 --> 00:42:12.333
Then what should
we do about it?

00:42:12.333 --> 00:42:14.433
This guy is saying,"
well, it's great.

00:42:14.433 --> 00:42:17.400
You just tell this guru how much
pollution your company is

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.400
responsible for, and he tells
you how many trees you have to

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:25.000
plant to atone for it." So
that's an easy way out of the

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.233
global warming problem.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.367
What's this one?

00:42:30.367 --> 00:42:32.600
Yeah, the universal excuse.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.567
So it used to be the dog
ate my homework.

00:42:34.567 --> 00:42:36.767
Now its global warming.

00:42:36.767 --> 00:42:40.467
Whatever problem you're
confronted with, just blame

00:42:40.467 --> 00:42:41.733
global warming.

00:42:44.833 --> 00:42:47.767
"Global warming does seem harder
and harder to deny."

00:42:47.767 --> 00:42:51.567
Where the polar bears are
sunning and the seals are

00:42:51.567 --> 00:42:52.800
playing volleyball.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:01.567
"So these scientists did this
experiment that if you drop a

00:43:01.567 --> 00:43:03.600
frog into boiling water,
he jumps out.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.733
But if you put him into warm
water and heat it slowly, he

00:43:07.733 --> 00:43:10.333
just swims around until he's
cooked." "Well, what's the

00:43:10.333 --> 00:43:13.633
point of that experiment?" And
the final frame says, "beats

00:43:13.633 --> 00:43:16.867
me." "Scientists, go figure."
"Probably the same ones

00:43:16.867 --> 00:43:20.333
studying global warming." And
there we all are in this

00:43:20.333 --> 00:43:24.800
gradually warming
bucket of water.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.367
And this is in the New York
Times this morning.

00:43:28.367 --> 00:43:31.033
This is the current one.

00:43:31.033 --> 00:43:34.033
It's called "Happy
Climate Change

00:43:34.033 --> 00:43:38.967
Denial Season." "Yee-haw!

00:43:38.967 --> 00:43:40.300
It's snowing.

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.633
Time to deny global warming."
And I'll let you

00:43:43.633 --> 00:43:46.767
read the rest of those.

00:43:46.767 --> 00:43:49.033
We're out of time for today,
but we'll continue this

00:43:49.033 --> 00:43:50.800
discussion next time.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.167
So we're finished.

00:43:53.167 --> 00:43:54.400
I'll leave that up there.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.510
Prof: We've reviewed
several times already,

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.020
at least some of the stuff for
your paper this week,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.429
if you're writing a paper on
Judaism and the law in early

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.780
Christianity;
different varieties.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.383
If you'll remember--and I've
reviewed this several times so

00:00:18.383 --> 00:00:22.346
this is just really briefly,
but one of the main themes of

00:00:22.346 --> 00:00:26.350
the whole course is the
diversity of early Christianity.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.670
How many different kinds of
early Christianities there were,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.320
and one of the important things
is--

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.558
or ways to look at that,
is what were their different

00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:35.887
views of the law,
so of course with Matthew,

00:00:35.887 --> 00:00:38.371
as we've seen,
Matthew treats the law,

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.188
the Jewish law,
as something that apparently he

00:00:41.188 --> 00:00:44.818
considers his--
the followers of his own church

00:00:44.818 --> 00:00:46.700
to continue to keep.
 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.250
There's no hint in Matthew that
the law would be abrogated.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.895
It's interpreted,
of course, so some of the

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:56.675
aspects of Sabbath observance
Jesus interprets differently in

00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:59.814
Matthew than do say,
the Pharisees in Matthew or the

00:00:59.814 --> 00:01:01.530
Scribes in Matthew or other
Jews.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.474
Matthew tends to give us the
idea that the law is just there

00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:07.480
to be observed by everybody.
 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.340
When we got to Luke/Acts we saw
that the Noachide laws,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.631
that is the laws given after
the flood to Noah,

00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:17.420
which are only four of them,
right?

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.390
You don't eat things that are
strangled,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.078
you don't eat blood,
you don't sacrifice idols and

00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:26.126
eat idol meat,
and I can't remember what one

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:28.851
of them was,
but there are certain laws that

00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:32.593
the Jews considered were given
to Noah after the flood and that

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:34.262
all peoples,
even Gentiles,

00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:36.170
were expected to follow those
rules,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.628
but the Jews didn't expect
Gentiles to keep other

00:01:39.628 --> 00:01:41.430
peculiarly Jewish laws.
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.450
Jews never expected Gentiles
not to eat pork,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.060
to keep the Sabbath,
to circumcise their children,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.489
and they never thought there
was anything wrong with Gentiles

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:50.340
doing those things.
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.483
Of course that's one of the
things that separated them from

00:01:52.483 --> 00:01:52.890
the Jews.
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.099
Luke/Acts seems to take that
kind of view of the law,

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.239
that the law is an ethnic--the
ethnic customs of the Jews,

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.391
similar to the ways that the
Romans would have their own laws

00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:05.283
and customs,
the Greeks would have their own

00:02:05.283 --> 00:02:07.141
laws and customs,
the Egyptians would have their

00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:09.147
laws and customs,
the Babylonians or the Persians

00:02:09.147 --> 00:02:10.568
would have their laws and
customs.

00:02:10.568 --> 00:02:14.710
So that seems to be the way the
Jewish law is treated in Luke

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.468
and Acts.
 

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:18.220
Paul, we've talked about Paul
in Romans and Galatians.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.110
He has a much more radical
teaching about the law,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.397
that the law is--Paul never
says that Jewish followers of

00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:30.068
Jesus shouldn't keep the law but
he certainly discourages--

00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:34.280
in fact he forbids--Gentile
converts to keep the law.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.766
In Galatians he says,
you would be justified by the

00:02:37.766 --> 00:02:40.068
law, you're cut off from grace.
 

00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:43.385
Paul has a much more radical
position and we could look at

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:43.910
others.
 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.786
We talked about Marcion,
remember Marcion at the very

00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:52.212
beginning of the course,
the guy in the second century

00:02:52.212 --> 00:02:54.744
in Rome,
he taught a version of

00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:57.841
Christianity in which he only
recognized the Gospel of Luke

00:02:57.841 --> 00:02:59.550
and just the letters of Paul.
 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.610
He was the first one to come up
with a canon list,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.096
we think, and then he edited
those to where anything positive

00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:08.351
about the Jewish law or the God
of the Jews was taken out

00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:11.954
because he believed that was a
junior false bad god and not the

00:03:11.954 --> 00:03:13.639
Father of Jesus Christ.
 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.949
So Marcion threw out the whole
Hebrew Bible,

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.401
the scriptures of Jews
entirely, and substituted for

00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:24.597
Jewish scripture his own edited
version of Luke and the letters

00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:25.408
of Paul.
 

00:03:25.408 --> 00:03:28.327
All of these are different ways
that early Christians talked

00:03:28.327 --> 00:03:29.960
about what to do about the law.
 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.560
We'll get to some of that again
in James today because we can--

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.166
you can read James,
as Lutheran and some people

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.060
read it,
as being basically a

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.598
disagreement with Pauline
Christianity.

00:03:41.598 --> 00:03:44.318
We'll talk about whether that's
a good reading of James or not,

00:03:44.318 --> 00:03:47.690
but quite often especially in
Protestant Christianity,

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.412
James has been read to be
arguing against Paul's law-free

00:03:52.412 --> 00:03:57.050
Gospel or justification by grace
through faith alone.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.633
Before we get to James I want
to highlight one other aspect

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:04.527
that we have talked about a bit
but I want to review it again as

00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:07.432
another illustration of the
diversities of early

00:04:07.432 --> 00:04:10.473
Christianity,
and this is our wonderful

00:04:10.473 --> 00:04:13.080
favorite topic,
Christologies.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.900
We've talked about different
Christologies all along.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.870
We've looked at different ones
in John and that sort of thing.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.470
But let's just look at a few
texts and read them together.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.190
First look at Luke,
of course Christology,

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.978
as you recall,
is what do you believe about

00:04:26.978 --> 00:04:27.709
Christ?
 

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:31.930
What kind of nature is Jesus
Christ or was Jesus Christ?

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.870
Luke 3:22:
 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.434
The Holy Spirit descended upon
Jesus in bodily form like a

00:04:45.434 --> 00:04:45.879
dove.
 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.843
And a voice came from heaven,
"You are my Son the

00:04:49.843 --> 00:04:53.060
beloved with you I am well
pleased."

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.199
Now if you notice that's a
quotation from the Psalms,

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.990
you can see it down in your
footnotes,

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.819
if you have a study Bible,
Psalm 2:7,

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.649
also it cites Isaiah 42:1.
 

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:06.310
If you also note there are some
little words,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.110
little numbers that have
footnotes,

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.362
probably if you--it's certainly
in the New Revised Standard

00:05:12.362 --> 00:05:14.800
Version,
the letter footnote numbers.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.415
There's one that says,
"Other ancient authorities

00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:18.726
read,
'You are my Son,

00:05:18.726 --> 00:05:21.596
today I have begotten
you.'" I've talked about

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:23.259
this already in the class.
 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.754
Now the debate among scholars
would be was "today I have

00:05:27.754 --> 00:05:31.500
begotten you"
originally in Luke's Gospel,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.290
and then some scribe took it
out, because we do find it in

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.341
some Greek manuscripts,
or was it not there originally

00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:42.899
in Luke's Gospel and other
scribes put it in?

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:45.610
Nice question.
 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.033
Did the original Gospel of Luke
have "today I have begotten

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:52.074
you" said by the voice from
heaven at the baptism of

00:05:52.074 --> 00:05:53.379
Jesus," or not?
 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:56.579
Now why would this be an
important issue?

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:59.750
Because if the voice from
heaven is saying,

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.319
"today I have
begotten you,"

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.949
which is a quote from the Psalm
after all,

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.062
then wouldn't that imply that
Jesus was not the Son of God

00:06:10.062 --> 00:06:11.139
yesterday?
 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.310
That's exactly the way some
Christians took it.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.850
They believed that Jesus
became the Son of God.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.937
He wasn't born the Son of God,
he was adopted as the Son of

00:06:21.937 --> 00:06:22.360
God.
 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.177
And some Christians said it was
at his baptism and they would

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:28.660
cite some Greek version of this
text.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.125
Now scholars have debated about
whether it was originally in the

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:32.509
text.
 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:34.600
If it's not in the text how
would it get there?

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.988
Well a scribe would see this,
"You are my beloved

00:06:36.988 --> 00:06:39.740
son," and the scribe might
know the Psalms very well,

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.639
and might know that the next
line of the Psalm was,

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.930
"today I have begotten
you," and so just quoted it

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.185
almost from memory from the
Psalm and therefore it got into

00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:47.690
the text.
 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.574
Or, as Bart Ehrman,
the author of your textbook has

00:06:51.574 --> 00:06:56.470
said, Bart actually became very
famous first as a text critic of

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.180
the New Testament.
 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.946
That is, his profession was
trying to figure out what was

00:07:00.946 --> 00:07:04.059
the most likely original reading
of the Greek New Testament text

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:06.480
by comparing all these different
manuscripts.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.920
He's argued that he thinks that
maybe the text originally said,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.281
"today I have begotten
you," and orthodox scribes

00:07:14.281 --> 00:07:16.370
took it out in the second
century.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.470
You can tell why orthodox
scribes may have taken it out.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.564
If they thought that that gave
weight to an adoptionist

00:07:22.564 --> 00:07:25.084
Christology, which they
considered heretical,

00:07:25.084 --> 00:07:27.319
they would take it out of the
text.

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:30.853
It's an open question,
some scholars say they think

00:07:30.853 --> 00:07:32.295
that,
"today I have begotten

00:07:32.295 --> 00:07:33.529
you," was not there
originally,

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:36.521
and therefore they agree with
the New Revised Standard Version

00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:39.747
in not putting it in the Bible,
but putting it in a footnote

00:07:39.747 --> 00:07:40.250
instead.
 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.879
And others would agree with
Bart Ehrman and say,

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.927
no it probably was in the text
and orthodox scribes took it out

00:07:45.927 --> 00:07:48.089
because it didn't sound orthodox
for them.

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:50.927
Anyway that's a clue that one
of the Christologies that was

00:07:50.927 --> 00:07:53.959
around and was debated in the
second century was precisely,

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:57.435
was Jesus born Son of God or
did he become Son of God by

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.079
adoption at his baptism?
 

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:04.028
Psalm 2:7 is one that you can
look that up for also.

00:08:04.028 --> 00:08:12.889
Now look at Luke 9:35:
"Then from the cloud came

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:20.384
a voice,"
this is at the transfiguration

00:08:20.384 --> 00:08:22.600
of Jesus.
 

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.658
Remember when he's up on the
mountain and his clothing

00:08:25.658 --> 00:08:28.370
changes, his face changes,
he starts shining.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.171
Now here's what the voice from
the heavens says this time:

00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:35.840
"This is my Son,
my chosen, listen to him."

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.072
"My chosen,"
again that sounds like God the

00:08:41.072 --> 00:08:45.542
Father chose Jesus,
maybe because of his special

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:48.059
righteousness,
to be his Son.

00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:51.639
Look at Acts 2:36.
 

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:54.241
Now Acts, of course written by
the same person who wrote Luke,

00:08:54.241 --> 00:08:56.928
so we're not changing authors
here we're just changing books.

00:08:56.928 --> 00:09:01.815
Acts 2:36, this is in a speech,
a sermon, one of the first

00:09:01.815 --> 00:09:04.129
sermons in Acts by Peter.
 

00:09:04.129 --> 00:09:08.908
From the day of Pentecost--you
know the story,

00:09:08.908 --> 00:09:12.322
the spirit and flames come down
and rest on the Christians and

00:09:12.322 --> 00:09:15.119
they all start speaking in
tongues and languages of

00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:18.259
everybody around the world,
and Peter gives a sermon.

00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:20.634
2:36: "Therefore let the
entire house of

00:09:20.634 --> 00:09:23.441
Israel…,"
now this is the way he ends the

00:09:23.441 --> 00:09:26.408
sermon so this is an emphatic
position in the text.

00:09:26.408 --> 00:09:27.970
This is the end of Peter's
sermon.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.769
"Let the entire house of
Israel know with certainty that

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:34.428
God has made him both Lord and
Messiah,

00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:36.330
this Jesus whom you
crucified."

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.918
"Has made him,"
again that idea.

00:09:38.918 --> 00:09:50.110
Look at Acts 13:33,
go back to verse 32:

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.658
"And we bring you the good
news that what God promised to

00:09:53.658 --> 00:09:57.268
our ancestors he has fulfilled
for us their children by raising

00:09:57.268 --> 00:09:57.850
Jesus.
 

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.833
As also it is written in the
second Psalm,

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.625
'You are my Son,
today I have begotten

00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:03.600
you.'"
Now it's the today,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.884
but what is the day that
this text seems to be

00:10:06.884 --> 00:10:07.960
referring too?
 

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.320
The resurrection.
 

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.783
Is this a hint that there were
other Christians who believed

00:10:13.783 --> 00:10:18.095
that Jesus was human until he
was raised from the dead and

00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:22.029
that's when he became divine and
the Son of God?

00:10:22.029 --> 00:10:24.990
Look at Romans now.
 

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:40.100
We're going to go to Paul,
Romans 1:3-4:

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.986
…which he promised
beforehand through his prophets

00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:46.384
and the holy scriptures,
the Gospel concerning his Son

00:10:46.384 --> 00:10:50.000
who was descended from David,
according to the flesh,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.841
and was declared to be Son of
God with power according to the

00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:57.168
spirit of holiness by
resurrection from the dead.

00:10:57.168 --> 00:11:00.139
Now I would dispute that
translation.

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:03.139
The Greek there that's
translated by your Bible as

00:11:03.139 --> 00:11:06.139
"declared,"
or at least by the NRSV,

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:08.283
I think is actually better
translated as

00:11:08.283 --> 00:11:10.870
"appoint"
or "designate."

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.952
Does anybody else have a
different word for

00:11:12.952 --> 00:11:14.740
"declare"
in that verse?

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.879
Let me read it again;
you look at verses 3 and 4 of

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:21.139
Romans 1,
"and was declared to be

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.344
Son of God with power according
to the spirit of holiness by

00:11:24.344 --> 00:11:26.298
resurrection from the
dead."

00:11:26.298 --> 00:11:28.629
Anybody else have a different
word than declare?

00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:30.210
Yes?
 

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:30.269
Student:  Designated.
 

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:31.631
Prof:
"Designated,"

00:11:31.631 --> 00:11:33.500
see that's exactly the word I
would have used.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.200
Is there a difference?
 

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.328
Well it could be,
there could be a slight

00:11:37.328 --> 00:11:38.658
difference in the idea.
 

00:11:38.658 --> 00:11:43.190
Did God just announce that
Jesus was divine at his

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.904
resurrection,
or did he make him,

00:11:45.904 --> 00:11:48.830
designate him,
like when you designate someone

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.918
to be the leader of the class,
to be the President of the

00:11:51.918 --> 00:11:53.936
United States,
you designate someone to an

00:11:53.936 --> 00:11:56.779
office and it's at the
designation of the office that

00:11:56.779 --> 00:11:59.129
the actual person becomes that
official.

00:11:59.129 --> 00:12:02.639
I think that's actually the
better translation of the Greek.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:06.957
That again, though,
would imply that Paul may be

00:12:06.957 --> 00:12:11.921
quoting a phrase that he maybe
gets from elsewhere that

00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:16.240
believed that Jesus became the
Son of God,

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.460
divine, at his resurrection.
 

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.453
Now of course I say Paul quoted
something because there are

00:12:21.453 --> 00:12:24.808
other indications in Paul that
he probably didn't believe that.

00:12:24.808 --> 00:12:29.041
Paul seems to give the idea in
other places that he had a

00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:32.970
Christology that Jesus was
preexistence as divine.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.554
In Philippians you get the
famous hymn where Christ

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:38.708
descends into the body and he
suffers as a slave and is raised

00:12:38.708 --> 00:12:39.330
back up.
 

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.585
There you almost get the idea
that Paul believed that Jesus

00:12:42.585 --> 00:12:45.279
was in a preexistent state as
the Son of God,

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:49.437
so this may not be Paul's own
considered theology or

00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:51.831
Christology,
and therefore some scholars

00:12:51.831 --> 00:12:54.522
have said maybe he's quoting a
line that he gets from someplace

00:12:54.522 --> 00:12:54.870
else.
 

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.379
It does show us that there may
have been other Christians who

00:12:58.379 --> 00:13:01.950
believed that Jesus became
divine only at his resurrection.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.999
In other words,
we can map out all these

00:13:04.999 --> 00:13:09.533
differences, and of course,
what was the Christology of the

00:13:09.533 --> 00:13:11.019
Gospel of John?
 

00:13:11.019 --> 00:13:14.179
When did Jesus become divine
according to the Gospel of John?

00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:16.440
Anybody?
 

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.100
He always was.
 

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.610
He was with God from the very
beginning.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.009
Everything was created through
him.

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:24.695
The beginning of the Gospel of
John ends up having the

00:13:24.695 --> 00:13:28.590
Christology that now has become
orthodox Christianity.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.011
These other Christologies were
all declared heretical at some

00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.149
point in Christian history.
 

00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:38.340
Notice how what we've got.
 

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.010
Let's say we've got the
historical Jesus,

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.950
and we can say certainly he was
a prophet.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.633
He was recognized as a prophet,
he seems to accept himself as a

00:13:46.633 --> 00:13:49.226
prophet,
and it may be that he claimed

00:13:49.226 --> 00:13:52.581
to be a king or a Messiah,
but certainly by the time of

00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:55.113
his execution some people
thought he was a king because

00:13:55.113 --> 00:13:57.269
that's the charge on which he
was executed.

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:59.678
This is Jesus of Nazareth,
King of the Jews,

00:13:59.678 --> 00:14:02.692
so the Romans executed Jesus
because at least either he or

00:14:02.692 --> 00:14:05.230
other people were claiming that
he was a king.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.220
He's a prophet and he's a king.
 

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.710
Does that mean Jesus is divine?
 

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:09.980
No of course not.
 

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.240
The Jews had lots of kings that
were not divine.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.840
The Jews had lots of prophets
that were not divine.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.755
Modern people sometimes get the
idea that the word

00:14:17.755 --> 00:14:20.135
"Christ"
or "Messiah"

00:14:20.135 --> 00:14:23.158
in itself signifies divinity,
but it doesn't.

00:14:23.158 --> 00:14:25.519
The "Messiah"
in Paul's day,

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:28.811
in Jesus' day was simply some
Jewish figure who would rise up

00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:31.663
and take over the throne of
David and reestablish the

00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:32.870
Kingdom of Israel.
 

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.261
Calling someone the Messiah in
the ancient world didn't mean

00:14:36.261 --> 00:14:37.470
that he was divine.
 

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.179
It might, but it didn't
necessarily at all.

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:43.813
Jesus is a prophet;
maybe he's even considered the

00:14:43.813 --> 00:14:44.230
Messiah.
 

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.610
That doesn't make him divine.
 

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.850
Some Christians therefore had
to make a decision.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:56.129
Is he human and only human?
 

00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:59.320
Is he human and divine?
 

00:15:02.788 --> 00:15:06.293
This is the take that most
followers of Jesus end up

00:15:06.293 --> 00:15:07.989
taking,
although there were some

00:15:07.989 --> 00:15:10.388
followers of Jesus who existed
all the way into the second

00:15:10.388 --> 00:15:12.240
century who believed he was
purely human.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.668
They tended to be Jewish
followers of Jesus,

00:15:14.668 --> 00:15:16.210
they accepted him as a great
prophet,

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:17.308
they even accepted him as a
Messiah,

00:15:17.308 --> 00:15:19.110
but that didn't mean they
thought he was God.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.105
They still wanted to be
complete monotheists and have

00:15:22.105 --> 00:15:22.970
only one God.
 

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.908
So they said,
no Jesus can't be divine.

00:15:25.908 --> 00:15:28.490
So some followers of Jesus
chose this route.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.528
Others, as we've seen in the
New Testament,

00:15:30.528 --> 00:15:31.450
chose this route.
 

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:37.629
Then, though you have to split
this up.

00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:41.289
Was he always divine or did he
become divine?

00:15:41.289 --> 00:15:43.039
Am I doing this right?
 

00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:44.470
Is this the next level?
 

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:49.038
I had this chart in my notes by
I gave it to JanJan because I

00:15:49.038 --> 00:15:53.225
thought she might have to
lecture today and I forgot it,

00:15:53.225 --> 00:15:55.509
so we're winging it folks.
 

00:15:55.509 --> 00:16:00.679
If he became divine,
he always was divine.

00:16:05.778 --> 00:16:09.600
If he became divine then when
did he become divine?

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.778
You had different choices again
like we've said:

00:16:12.778 --> 00:16:15.653
at his birth,
because then you have the songs

00:16:15.653 --> 00:16:19.297
that all the angels sing and you
take some of those songs at the

00:16:19.297 --> 00:16:22.884
beginning of Luke and it sounds
like they're talking about he's

00:16:22.884 --> 00:16:25.764
divine now;
at his baptism,

00:16:25.764 --> 00:16:31.370
as we've seen some people tend
to believe;

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.879
or at his resurrection.
 

00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:37.779
So, Christians again seem to
have divided up.

00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:40.255
Do you take him as becoming
divine at his birth,

00:16:40.255 --> 00:16:42.100
his baptism,
or his resurrection?

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.399
We've seen other Christians
say, no he always was divine,

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:51.538
but even then they split up
into different choices too

00:16:51.538 --> 00:16:58.950
because some of them said he was
divine but also fully human,

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:06.099
so he was both divine but also
fleshly.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:07.180
Where have seen this?
 

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.012
A letter in the New Testament
insisting that you can't have

00:17:11.012 --> 00:17:14.978
Jesus as divine without also
having him as come in the flesh,

00:17:14.978 --> 00:17:16.299
do you remember?
 

00:17:16.299 --> 00:17:19.078
1 John, exactly.
 

00:17:19.078 --> 00:17:21.140
The letters of John get into
this argument.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.936
Apparently some people in the
Johannine community were

00:17:23.936 --> 00:17:26.838
claiming that Jesus was fully
divine but not fleshly.

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:31.765
Then you have--so this became
that position,

00:17:31.765 --> 00:17:37.262
flesh and divine,
and the other position I called

00:17:37.262 --> 00:17:41.960
it when I lectured on John,
Docetism.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.660
That is, what came to be a
heresy, remember,

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.816
in the second century there was
no organized church that could

00:17:48.816 --> 00:17:51.868
be able to declare what counted
as orthodoxy and heresy,

00:17:51.868 --> 00:17:54.630
but this idea was Jesus was not
fully flesh.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:58.219
He was so divine he was God so
that when he walked along on the

00:17:58.219 --> 00:18:01.519
wet sand on the beach his feet
didn't leave footprints.

00:18:01.519 --> 00:18:03.710
That's how divine he was.
 

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.410
He didn't have any weight about
him;

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.788
he was not even fully flesh.
 

00:18:06.788 --> 00:18:11.249
Notice all of these are choices
that followers of Jesus had to

00:18:11.249 --> 00:18:14.318
make in the decades following
his death.

00:18:14.318 --> 00:18:17.035
Some of them took the human
route, some of them took the

00:18:17.035 --> 00:18:19.701
human and divine route,
some of them --believed that he

00:18:19.701 --> 00:18:20.588
became divine.
 

00:18:20.588 --> 00:18:23.288
This became declared as a
heresy.

00:18:23.288 --> 00:18:26.308
We call it adoptionism of some
sort.

00:18:26.308 --> 00:18:29.578
Then of those who took the
always divine route,

00:18:29.578 --> 00:18:32.705
which became orthodoxy,
some of them also took the

00:18:32.705 --> 00:18:35.513
docetic route:
that he wasn't fully human and

00:18:35.513 --> 00:18:36.279
fleshly.
 

00:18:36.279 --> 00:18:39.250
And than others took this
route, like the Gospel of John

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.275
does and the letters of John,
that he is both fleshly and

00:18:42.275 --> 00:18:42.868
divine.
 

00:18:42.868 --> 00:18:47.689
Notice how what this shows is
that from simply the historical

00:18:47.689 --> 00:18:51.945
existence of Jesus and his
existence as a prophet or a

00:18:51.945 --> 00:18:54.349
king,
you had to make all these

00:18:54.349 --> 00:18:57.999
different choices to get down to
this one because which of

00:18:57.999 --> 00:19:00.678
these--
all these different--we have

00:19:00.678 --> 00:19:02.196
one, two,
three, four,

00:19:02.196 --> 00:19:04.650
five different possibilities
down here,

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.130
six right there.
 

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:10.490
Out of six choices,
only one of them is considered

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.250
orthodox by the later church.
 

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:18.630
I do this just to show these
diversities are there.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.240
If you're a Christian you
believe that,

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.509
well, the Holy Spirit or God's
providence led the way through

00:19:25.509 --> 00:19:29.000
this history so that what we end
up with is the Nicene Creed,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.696
or the Creed of Chalcedon,
which is what we ought to

00:19:31.696 --> 00:19:34.494
believe as Christians,
but as a historian you can't

00:19:34.494 --> 00:19:35.548
make that judgment.
 

00:19:35.548 --> 00:19:39.679
As a historian you simply have
to point out that there were

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:43.808
lots of complexities in early
Christianity that finally got

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:48.579
whittled down into a more united
consensus view on Christology.

00:19:48.579 --> 00:19:52.808
Any questions about any of that?
 

00:19:52.808 --> 00:19:56.607
I'm doing this partly just to
show you how this happened

00:19:56.607 --> 00:20:00.337
historically and this actually
gets you into a post-New

00:20:00.337 --> 00:20:02.410
Testament kind of subject.
 

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.759
You could easily take a course
after this,

00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:08.618
say the one taught by Bentley
Layton or Steven Davis,

00:20:08.618 --> 00:20:11.194
that analyzes--it's called
"From Jesus to

00:20:11.194 --> 00:20:13.598
Augustine,"
I think he's taken it past

00:20:13.598 --> 00:20:14.630
Augustine now.
 

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.198
That covers a little bit of the
New Testament text but really

00:20:17.198 --> 00:20:18.996
that's a course on the
development of early

00:20:18.996 --> 00:20:20.880
Christianity in its first few
centuries.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.928
You could even take courses
that talk about the development

00:20:23.928 --> 00:20:26.817
of Christianity all the way up
from the beginning to the

00:20:26.817 --> 00:20:28.500
Reformation, or even beyond.
 

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.438
In any of these historical
courses you're going to see this

00:20:31.438 --> 00:20:34.022
kind of diversity and the
shaping of this that comes

00:20:34.022 --> 00:20:34.529
about.
 

00:20:34.529 --> 00:20:37.778
Part of what I'm doing is just
illustrating the diversity of

00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.868
Christianity and how it came
about,

00:20:39.868 --> 00:20:44.398
but I'm also trying to model a
behavior for you of thinking

00:20:44.398 --> 00:20:48.848
historically about what are
actually theological texts.

00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:51.817
Thinking about the growth of
Christianity as if it didn't

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:54.680
just plop out of the sky all in
one orthodox piece,

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.508
but it took a historical
process of struggle to come

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:01.782
about,
and it was a complicated

00:21:01.782 --> 00:21:02.970
historical process.
 

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.710
Now where does that leave us
with James?

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:10.813
James provides us another
example of differences in

00:21:10.813 --> 00:21:15.000
notions of faith and works when
compared to Paul.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.710
First, I'm going to take some
examples from Hebrew scripture,

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:23.212
so if you've got your Bible,
now I haven't taught you a song

00:21:23.212 --> 00:21:26.898
for the Old Testament books,
the books of Hebrew scripture,

00:21:26.898 --> 00:21:29.230
so you'll just have to follow
along as best you can.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:34.000
Proverbs, in my Bible it's page
904 in the Hebrew Bible,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.118
but that's not the Bible you
have, I would hasten to say.

00:21:39.118 --> 00:21:42.166
The Proverbs of Solomon,
Son of David,

00:21:42.166 --> 00:21:46.496
King of Israel,
For learning about wisdom and

00:21:46.496 --> 00:21:49.067
instruction,
for understanding words of

00:21:49.067 --> 00:21:50.950
insight,
for gaining instruction and

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.406
wise dealing,
righteousness,

00:21:52.406 --> 00:21:54.555
justice and equity,
to teach shrewdness to the

00:21:54.555 --> 00:21:56.373
simple,
knowledge and prudence to the

00:21:56.373 --> 00:21:58.330
young,
let the wise also hear and gain

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.377
in learning and the discerning
acquire skill to understand a

00:22:01.377 --> 00:22:04.482
proverb and a figure,
the words of the wise and their

00:22:04.482 --> 00:22:05.009
riddles.
 

00:22:05.009 --> 00:22:07.634
The fear of the Lord [this is
one of my mom's favorite verses

00:22:07.634 --> 00:22:10.249
when I was a kid,
quoted all the time to us]

00:22:10.249 --> 00:22:13.992
is the beginning of wisdom,
fools despise wisdom and

00:22:13.992 --> 00:22:14.970
instruction.
 

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.328
Kind of a motherly type verse
isn't it?

00:22:18.328 --> 00:22:23.920
What you've got in Proverbs is
a whole series of teachings,

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.660
wisdom sayings,
and some of them are pretty --

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.707
they're just like cover your
mouth when you cough type

00:22:31.707 --> 00:22:33.776
things,
there are some things that

00:22:33.776 --> 00:22:35.710
aren't particularly heavy or
philosophical,

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.707
or theological,
but just sayings,

00:22:38.707 --> 00:22:40.298
wisdom sayings.
 

00:22:40.298 --> 00:22:42.828
Another one of my mother's
favorite ones was,

00:22:42.828 --> 00:22:45.660
there was a women's club at the
college she went too,

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.868
the Christian college she went
too,

00:22:46.868 --> 00:22:50.328
and the quotation of it was
from this proverb where it's

00:22:50.328 --> 00:22:54.103
talking about a worthy woman and
the quotation from the Bible

00:22:54.103 --> 00:22:56.034
was,
"Her price is far above

00:22:56.034 --> 00:22:58.176
rubies,"
and that was the motto for this

00:22:58.176 --> 00:22:58.858
girls club.
 

00:22:58.858 --> 00:23:04.166
And my mother always said,
"I wonder how much Ruby

00:23:04.166 --> 00:23:05.740
charges."
 

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.170
That's sort of--it's little
sayings--

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.228
not "how much does Ruby
charge,"

00:23:10.228 --> 00:23:12.990
that's not part of the
scripture but the other part,

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.509
is part of the scripture.
 

00:23:14.509 --> 00:23:17.200
These are wisdom sayings,
and this is wisdom literature,

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.796
so in the Jewish scripture you
have whole books that are

00:23:19.796 --> 00:23:22.380
basically wisdom literature,
and scholars will use that term.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.778
They're sayings of wisdom kind
of sayings.

00:23:24.778 --> 00:23:29.196
You get it also in Job,
look at Job,

00:23:29.196 --> 00:23:33.109
it's before Psalms,
Job 14:1.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:43.140
Job is also one version of
wisdom literature.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.204
A mortal born of woman,
few of days,

00:23:46.204 --> 00:23:50.232
and full of trouble,
comes up like a flower and

00:23:50.232 --> 00:23:54.700
withers, flees like a shadow and
does not last.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.848
Ah, how sad.
 

00:23:58.848 --> 00:24:01.970
Notice wisdom literature isn't
always very cheery.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:06.098
A lot of wisdom literature is
about how difficult life is,

00:24:06.098 --> 00:24:08.673
that life is fleeting,
that you just come up like a

00:24:08.673 --> 00:24:11.029
flower,
you're beautiful and young for

00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:14.160
two weeks and then you fade and
get old and ugly,

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.710
and then you die.
 

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.730
A lot of wisdom literature is
sort of like,

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.410
life's a bitch so just enjoy it
while you can,

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.452
and that's where you get some
of the sayings out of Job and

00:24:25.452 --> 00:24:26.240
the Proverbs.
 

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.954
The Wisdom of Solomon,
that may be in your--I don't

00:24:29.954 --> 00:24:32.108
have the Wisdom of Solomon.
 

00:24:32.108 --> 00:24:35.115
In your Apocrypha,
if you have a Bible that has

00:24:35.115 --> 00:24:37.717
the Apocrypha in it,
you would find the Wisdom of

00:24:37.717 --> 00:24:40.854
Solomon,
which also has--if you look at

00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:45.792
the Wisdom of Solomon 6:17-20
has some wonderful wisdom

00:24:45.792 --> 00:24:46.798
sayings.
 

00:24:46.798 --> 00:24:52.740
Sirach 4 has sayings about the
poor,

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.371
about remembering the poor,
it's an admonition to rich

00:24:55.371 --> 00:24:58.890
people to remember the poor,
do not forsake the poor,

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.519
and Sirach 6:5 has a warning
about speech,

00:25:02.519 --> 00:25:04.588
control your speech,
watch your tongue.

00:25:04.588 --> 00:25:08.111
Notice these sayings,
things about how life is

00:25:08.111 --> 00:25:10.517
fleeting,
you come up like flowers,

00:25:10.517 --> 00:25:12.730
like grass,
it fades, take care of the

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.348
poor, don't forget the poor.
 

00:25:14.348 --> 00:25:17.376
Wisdom literature often seems
to be written within a context

00:25:17.376 --> 00:25:19.838
of people who are fairly well
off themselves,

00:25:19.838 --> 00:25:22.198
rich people,
and it's written to these rich

00:25:22.198 --> 00:25:25.680
people but in order to also get
them not to forget the poor.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.715
Then the saying about watch
your mouth, control the tongue

00:25:29.715 --> 00:25:32.690
that we see in Sirach 6:5 is
also there.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:41.501
Now, with that in mind,
all these other kinds of wisdom

00:25:41.501 --> 00:25:51.130
literature, turn to James and
look at chapter 3 of James.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.560
Not many of you should become
teachers my brothers [my

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.827
translation says
"sisters"

00:25:56.827 --> 00:25:59.868
but in the Greek it's just
"brothers"]

00:25:59.868 --> 00:26:03.558
for you know that we who teach
will be judged with greater

00:26:03.558 --> 00:26:04.788
strictness.
 

00:26:04.788 --> 00:26:07.568
For all of us make many
mistakes.

00:26:07.568 --> 00:26:10.247
Anyone who makes no mistakes in
speaking is perfect,

00:26:10.247 --> 00:26:13.028
able to keep the whole body in
check with a bridle.

00:26:13.028 --> 00:26:16.695
If we put bits into the mouths
of horses to make them obey us

00:26:16.695 --> 00:26:18.528
we guide their whole bodies.
 

00:26:18.528 --> 00:26:23.240
Notice this is just folk
wisdom, right?

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.844
Look how you control a horse,
you put a bit in its mouth,

00:26:26.844 --> 00:26:30.900
you pull the horse's mouth this
way, the horse goes this way;

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.288
you pull the horse's mouth that
way, the horse goes that way.

00:26:33.288 --> 00:26:36.048
This is nothing really big
revelation type stuff right?

00:26:36.048 --> 00:26:38.962
This is not kind of revealing
secrets of God,

00:26:38.962 --> 00:26:42.338
or this is not even revealing
secrets of the Gospel,

00:26:42.338 --> 00:26:44.259
this is just folk wisdom.
 

00:26:44.259 --> 00:26:47.154
That's what a lot of wisdom
literature in the Bible also

00:26:47.154 --> 00:26:48.470
looks like folk wisdom.
 

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.170
Or look at ships he says,
another example:

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:51.500
...
 

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.141
though they are so large that
it takes strong winds to drive

00:26:54.141 --> 00:26:56.061
them,
yet they are guided by a very

00:26:56.061 --> 00:26:58.211
small rudder,
wherever the will of the pilot

00:26:58.211 --> 00:27:00.819
directs,
so also the tongue is a small

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:03.798
member yet it boasts of great
exploits.

00:27:03.798 --> 00:27:07.982
Almost--it just really echoes
that kind of stuff you can see

00:27:07.982 --> 00:27:11.670
in Sirach, in Proverbs,
and those kinds of things.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.753
One of the things that James
is, the letter of James is a

00:27:15.753 --> 00:27:19.619
representation of typical Jewish
wisdom literature.

00:27:19.619 --> 00:27:21.358
Why do I say Jewish?
 

00:27:21.358 --> 00:27:23.487
Because this is actually a very
Jewish document,

00:27:23.487 --> 00:27:25.480
there's almost no mention of
Christ in it.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.190
If you took out a few sentences
here and there,

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.880
the letter of James could read
as a non-Christian document,

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.519
because most of this stuff
about the tongue,

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:35.779
how you control the tongue,
about remembering the poor,

00:27:35.779 --> 00:27:37.568
all these sorts of things,
this is stuff anybody--

00:27:37.568 --> 00:27:39.670
any Jewish person in the
ancient world could have said.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:41.160
It's not particularly Christian.
 

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.551
So James is an example of
ancient typical Jewish wisdom

00:27:45.551 --> 00:27:46.608
literature.
 

00:27:46.608 --> 00:27:50.669
But, and here's where James
becomes very interesting for

00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:52.220
Christian readings.
 

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:19.058
Let's read Romans 4, Romans 4:1.
 

00:28:19.058 --> 00:28:21.571
Now you're familiar with this,
you've already talked about

00:28:21.571 --> 00:28:24.038
Paul, you've written about Paul,
you know about Paul:

00:28:24.038 --> 00:28:26.506
What then are we to say was
gained by Abraham,

00:28:26.506 --> 00:28:28.588
our ancestor according to the
flesh?

00:28:28.588 --> 00:28:32.630
For if Abraham was justified by
works he has something to boast

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.390
about but not before God.
 

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.440
For what does the scripture say?
 

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.247
" Abraham believed God and
it was reckoned to him as

00:28:39.247 --> 00:28:40.348
righteousness."
 

00:28:40.348 --> 00:28:42.836
Now keep that scripture in
mind, that's a quotation from

00:28:42.836 --> 00:28:43.288
Genesis.
 

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:45.785
Abraham believed God and it was
reckoned to him as

00:28:45.785 --> 00:28:46.598
righteousness.
 

00:28:46.598 --> 00:28:49.454
Now to one who works,
wages are not reckoned as a

00:28:49.454 --> 00:28:51.180
gift, but as something due.
 

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.452
But to one who without work
trusts him who justifies the

00:28:53.452 --> 00:28:55.558
ungodly, such faith is reckoned
as righteousness.

00:28:55.558 --> 00:28:58.318
Then Paul goes on and takes his
argument further.

00:28:58.318 --> 00:29:02.102
Galatians 3 has a very similar
thing, it quotes the same kind

00:29:02.102 --> 00:29:05.884
of scriptures from Galatians,
and Paul in Galatians makes the

00:29:05.884 --> 00:29:06.828
same point.
 

00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:09.358
Abraham was not justified by
works,

00:29:09.358 --> 00:29:12.250
and he quotes some of this very
scripture to prove,

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.567
according to Paul,
that Genesis shows that Abraham

00:29:15.567 --> 00:29:18.740
was not justified by works,
he was justified by faith.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:32.615
Now look back at James 1,
first chapter of James,

00:29:32.615 --> 00:29:39.404
verses 22-25:
But be doers of the word and

00:29:39.404 --> 00:29:42.730
not merely hearers who deceive
themselves.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.394
For if any are hearers of the
word and not doers they are like

00:29:46.394 --> 00:29:48.980
those who look at themselves in
a mirror.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.647
For they look at themselves and
on going away immediately forget

00:29:52.647 --> 00:29:53.930
what they were like.
 

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:55.440
But those who look into the
perfect law,

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.271
the law of liberty and
persevere, not being hearers who

00:29:59.271 --> 00:30:03.119
forgot but doers who act,
they will be blessed in their

00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:03.569
doing.
 

00:30:03.569 --> 00:30:09.770
Look at James 2:14:
What good is it my brothers if

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:13.269
you say you have faith but do
not have works?

00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:14.650
Can faith save you?
 

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:19.150
[Well I think Paul would say,
as a matter of fact James,

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.469
yes.]
If a brother or sister is naked

00:30:21.469 --> 00:30:24.818
and lacks daily food and one of
you says to them,

00:30:24.818 --> 00:30:26.442
"Go in peace,
be warmed and eat your

00:30:26.442 --> 00:30:28.880
fill," and yet you do not
supply their bodily needs,

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.880
what good is that?
 

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.625
Faith by itself,
if it has no works,

00:30:32.625 --> 00:30:33.410
is dead.
 

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:41.358
Look at 21-26 of the same
chapter, James 2:21-26:

00:30:41.358 --> 00:30:45.430
Was not our ancestor Abraham
justified by works when he

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.220
offered his son Isaac on the
altar?

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.160
You see that faith was active
along with his works,

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.160
and faith was brought to
completion by the works.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.320
Thus the scripture was
fulfilled that says,

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.203
"Abraham believed God,
and it was reckoned to him as

00:30:59.203 --> 00:31:00.440
righteousness."
 

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:06.338
Notice this guy quotes the
exact same verse Paul quotes,

00:31:06.338 --> 00:31:09.880
but to make the opposite point.
 

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.317
Paul had quoted this very verse
to argue that Abraham was

00:31:13.317 --> 00:31:15.650
justified by his faith not by
works;

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.143
this writer quotes the same
verse from Genesis to say

00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:21.358
Abraham was justified by works.
 

00:31:21.358 --> 00:31:24.413
You see that a person is
justified by works and not by

00:31:24.413 --> 00:31:25.220
faith alone.
 

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.844
Likewise was not Rahab the
prostitute also justified by

00:31:27.844 --> 00:31:30.663
works when she welcomed the
messengers and sent them out by

00:31:30.663 --> 00:31:31.490
another road?
 

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.127
This is when the Israelites
were surrounding the city of

00:31:34.127 --> 00:31:36.958
Jericho before they marched
around it and made all the walls

00:31:36.958 --> 00:31:37.630
fall down.
 

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.959
Two of the spies came into
Jericho and they were received

00:31:39.959 --> 00:31:42.364
by a prostitute,
Rahab, "For just as the

00:31:42.364 --> 00:31:45.882
body without the spirit is dead
so faith without works is also

00:31:45.882 --> 00:31:46.690
dead."
 

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:51.930
Now these texts seem to be
arguing against Paul,

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:57.728
and it makes us wonder,
does the author actually have

00:31:57.728 --> 00:32:01.519
texts of Paul in front of him?
 

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:04.675
Is he actually reading Romans
and Galatians and he sees that

00:32:04.675 --> 00:32:06.868
Paul quotes this passage from
Genesis,

00:32:06.868 --> 00:32:09.113
and therefore,
he quotes the same passage to

00:32:09.113 --> 00:32:10.470
make the opposite point?
 

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.528
Or has he heard about Paul's
Gospel about a works free Gospel

00:32:14.528 --> 00:32:17.710
in some places and he's
responding to rumors?

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:24.038
Or is he just responding to
Paul-type Christians?

00:32:24.038 --> 00:32:26.375
He may not know Paul himself,
he may not even have access to

00:32:26.375 --> 00:32:28.832
Paul's work,
but he's heard some people who

00:32:28.832 --> 00:32:32.368
are followers of Paul and
promote his kind of law-free,

00:32:32.368 --> 00:32:35.369
faith dominated Gospel,
and he's writing against those

00:32:35.369 --> 00:32:36.390
kinds of people.
 

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.750
It's very difficult to say.
 

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:43.595
As I think Bart Ehrman in the
textbook points out,

00:32:43.595 --> 00:32:48.461
and other people have said all
along, there is a way to sort of

00:32:48.461 --> 00:32:51.130
get beyond this contradiction.
 

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:55.161
To say that maybe the writer of
James is not saying really the

00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:58.068
opposite of what Paul is saying
after all.

00:32:58.068 --> 00:33:01.150
Have any of you picked up on
that argument?

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.990
Yes, what's the argument?
 

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:05.736
Student:  They're
operating on different

00:33:05.736 --> 00:33:06.990
definitions of works and faith?
 

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:09.613
Prof: Yes,
they're operating on different

00:33:09.613 --> 00:33:13.130
definitions of works and faith,
and that's a very good point.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:17.519
Notice for example,
what was faith for Paul?

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:20.700
Faith, and this is something
that modern people,

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.818
Christians as well as
non-Christians,

00:33:22.818 --> 00:33:26.896
radical atheists,
Richard Dawkins and Christopher

00:33:26.896 --> 00:33:30.380
Hitchens published these books
saying,

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.534
religious people in general are
crazy people who believe lots of

00:33:34.534 --> 00:33:37.038
ridiculous things before
breakfast,

00:33:37.038 --> 00:33:40.210
and just think that--the idea
is that if you're a religious

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.106
person you do believe that
people go around walking on

00:33:43.106 --> 00:33:45.994
water all the time,
that hell exists under the

00:33:45.994 --> 00:33:48.586
ground below our feet,
that God is this man with a

00:33:48.586 --> 00:33:50.440
beard who sits up in the clouds
somewhere,

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.200
and so there are a lot of
people who think,

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.368
what is religious faith?
 

00:33:53.368 --> 00:33:55.618
Well, it's actually believing
certain propositions.

00:33:55.618 --> 00:33:58.173
Its believing a proposition
like there is a God,

00:33:58.173 --> 00:34:01.107
God is alive in the same way
that you would believe the

00:34:01.107 --> 00:34:03.500
proposition is it's sun shining
outside.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.375
It's a proposition,
you just look at nature,

00:34:05.375 --> 00:34:06.250
you figure it out.
 

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:11.300
Now in the Terry lectures a
year ago--I believe a year ago,

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:16.351
Terry Eagleton who's a very
famous Marxist literary critic,

00:34:16.351 --> 00:34:18.789
but he grew up Catholic.
 

00:34:18.789 --> 00:34:21.076
He gave the Terry lectures;
they've just come out in

00:34:21.076 --> 00:34:23.159
publication by Yale University
Press.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.550
I recommend them very highly.
 

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:28.059
He gave four lectures in which
he took on these sort of radical

00:34:28.059 --> 00:34:30.224
atheists,
and Terry Eagleton wasn't

00:34:30.224 --> 00:34:32.480
arguing himself for Christian
faith,

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.809
I don't even know whether he
believes Christian stuff or not,

00:34:35.809 --> 00:34:39.083
but what he was trying to argue
is that what has counted as

00:34:39.083 --> 00:34:42.074
Christian faith over the
centuries is more complicated

00:34:42.074 --> 00:34:44.389
than simply believing a
proposition,

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.329
that say the proposition God
exists.

00:34:46.329 --> 00:34:50.661
For Paul, as a matter of fact,
having faith is more a sense of

00:34:50.661 --> 00:34:54.842
putting your trust in God,
so talking about trust,

00:34:54.842 --> 00:34:59.639
faith for Paul is trusting God
to do what you need.

00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:03.219
Faith is not simply a belief in
certain kinds of propositions,

00:35:03.219 --> 00:35:07.172
like a scientific proposition,
it's actually an attitude of

00:35:07.172 --> 00:35:10.989
putting all of your trust in God
through Jesus Christ.

00:35:10.989 --> 00:35:14.588
This notion therefore that
faith is something that you

00:35:14.588 --> 00:35:18.391
believe about is not really
matched by Paul's writings on

00:35:18.391 --> 00:35:20.336
faith,
which are much more complex and

00:35:20.336 --> 00:35:22.769
they're much more like the idea
that faith is a way of living;

00:35:22.769 --> 00:35:25.929
faith is a decision.
 

00:35:25.929 --> 00:35:28.067
Soren Kierkegaard,
The Great Leap of Faith,

00:35:28.067 --> 00:35:29.949
the nineteenth century
philosopher.

00:35:29.949 --> 00:35:33.561
Faith is this willingness to
just throw it all in even though

00:35:33.561 --> 00:35:36.210
all the evidence might be to the
contrary.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:38.469
It's a decision you make,
it's a leap of faith,

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.090
in Kierkegaard's understanding.
 

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.929
That's what it's more like for
Paul.

00:35:41.929 --> 00:35:45.766
But notice that's not exactly
what James seems to think faith

00:35:45.766 --> 00:35:47.072
is,
and this is why some people

00:35:47.072 --> 00:35:49.123
have said that Paul and James
are not really disagreeing with

00:35:49.123 --> 00:35:51.039
each other because they're
working with different notions

00:35:51.039 --> 00:35:51.860
of faith and works.
 

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.190
What does James say?
 

00:35:53.190 --> 00:36:01.724
James 2:19, "You believe
that God is one,

00:36:01.724 --> 00:36:04.380
you do well.
 

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.010
Even the demons believe and
shudder."

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:10.699
That's a pretty big clue.
 

00:36:10.699 --> 00:36:15.074
Do you think Paul would have
ever said that demons have faith

00:36:15.074 --> 00:36:15.949
in Christ?
 

00:36:15.949 --> 00:36:17.800
No.
 

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.527
Paul actually doesn't talk
about demons enough for us to

00:36:20.527 --> 00:36:21.369
really be sure.
 

00:36:21.369 --> 00:36:24.210
He only mentions demons once in
all of his letters,

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:27.246
and that's in 1 Corinthians 10,
and he's just talking to the

00:36:27.246 --> 00:36:29.713
Corinthians saying,
don't participate in idol

00:36:29.713 --> 00:36:32.596
sacrifices because that's
participating in the table of

00:36:32.596 --> 00:36:33.130
demons.
 

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.190
Paul's not too concerned about
demons.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.648
I would think it would be
outlandish to think that Paul

00:36:38.648 --> 00:36:42.300
would have considered demons as
having faith in Christ.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.480
Do demons believe that Christ
exists?

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.119
Paul would say, yeah, of course.
 

00:36:46.119 --> 00:36:49.411
Demons know God exists,
demons know Christ exists,

00:36:49.411 --> 00:36:53.039
so that's not what Paul's
definition of Christian faith

00:36:53.039 --> 00:36:53.510
is.
 

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:56.889
But that is what James seems to
be thinking faith is.

00:36:56.889 --> 00:37:00.445
It's simply the mental
acknowledgement of the existence

00:37:00.445 --> 00:37:03.545
of God and that God is one,
that is, the rejection of

00:37:03.545 --> 00:37:05.980
idolatry and polytheism and the
idea that God is one.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.822
Now faith, therefore,
for James is not the same kind

00:37:09.822 --> 00:37:13.791
of thing as faith is for Paul,
and that's why you can have

00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:16.273
Paul saying,
you're justified by faith and

00:37:16.273 --> 00:37:18.579
James disagreeing with him by
saying,

00:37:18.579 --> 00:37:21.197
look even demons have faith,
they believe and they're not

00:37:21.197 --> 00:37:23.690
saved by it,
so you have to have works also.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:27.775
But also works is not really
the same thing for Paul as for

00:37:27.775 --> 00:37:28.340
James.
 

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.197
Remember I talked about how the
traditional way of understanding

00:37:31.197 --> 00:37:33.012
Paul,
this sort of Lutheran way,

00:37:33.012 --> 00:37:36.423
was that when Paul was talking
about salvation by works versus

00:37:36.423 --> 00:37:39.088
salvation by faith,
what he's talking about--and

00:37:39.088 --> 00:37:41.996
this is sort of the Protestant
way of thinking that's become

00:37:41.996 --> 00:37:43.820
more popular in the modern
world--

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.750
"works"
stand for anything humans can

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.960
do.
 

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.956
For Martin Luther works weren't
just circumcision or keeping

00:37:49.956 --> 00:37:53.141
kashrut, or keeping the
Sabbath--in other words,

00:37:53.141 --> 00:37:55.039
works of the Jewish law.
 

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:58.505
For Martin Luther works were
indulgences sold by the Roman

00:37:58.505 --> 00:37:59.599
Catholic Church.
 

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:06.364
Works were even being baptized;
works were confessing and doing

00:38:06.364 --> 00:38:07.360
penance.
 

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.706
For Martin Luther,
the works he was saying don't

00:38:10.706 --> 00:38:15.123
save you were any activity that
human beings do in order to try

00:38:15.123 --> 00:38:17.190
earn their own salvation.
 

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:21.619
That's not what works are for
Paul.

00:38:21.619 --> 00:38:25.434
When Paul talks about works in
Romans he's clearly talking

00:38:25.434 --> 00:38:27.309
about works of Jewish law.
 

00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:29.340
He's talking about circumcision.
 

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.483
Now I'm not saying that that
means that you can't read Paul

00:38:32.483 --> 00:38:33.460
as a Protestant.
 

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:35.150
If you want to read Paul as a
Protestant that's fine.

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:38.746
You can read a certain kind of
idea of salvation by grace

00:38:38.746 --> 00:38:41.510
through faith,
apart from even human endeavor,

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.679
in Paul's letter to the Romans,
but that's not the main thing

00:38:44.679 --> 00:38:45.829
Paul was talking about.
 

00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:49.079
The main thing Paul was doing
was trying to get Gentiles in

00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:52.050
Rome not to feel like they had
to keep Jewish law,

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:55.110
but also then not to despise
Jewish followers of Jesus and

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.400
not to despise Israel.
 

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.653
Romans is a complicated letter,
but it wasn't as simple you

00:39:00.653 --> 00:39:04.469
might give the idea from
traditional Protestant piety

00:39:04.469 --> 00:39:07.329
which is, works are human
activity.

00:39:07.329 --> 00:39:10.472
That is obviously what James
takes works to be,

00:39:10.472 --> 00:39:11.018
right?
 

00:39:11.018 --> 00:39:13.610
He's not talking about works of
Jewish law;

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:15.139
he's not talking about
circumcision.

00:39:15.139 --> 00:39:17.293
There's nowhere in the letter
of James that he tells his

00:39:17.293 --> 00:39:18.860
followers, you have to be
circumcised.

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.530
There's nowhere he says,
you have to keep the Sabbath.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:24.612
What he does say,
is you've got to take care of

00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:27.961
the poor, you have to do
justice, you have to right

00:39:27.961 --> 00:39:28.699
things.
 

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:32.802
Notice how the social situation
of James churches might tell us

00:39:32.802 --> 00:39:36.971
something about why he comes to
his belief in faith that he does

00:39:36.971 --> 00:39:40.809
and why he comes to a belief
about works that he does.

00:39:40.809 --> 00:39:43.311
Look at James 2:1-7,
and remember now,

00:39:43.311 --> 00:39:47.300
when I was reading about--I
mentioned Sirach and these other

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.409
wisdom literature that mentioned
the poor.

00:39:50.409 --> 00:39:53.728
My brothers do you with your
acts of favoritism [that is

00:39:53.728 --> 00:39:55.661
favoring the rich in your
church]

00:39:55.661 --> 00:39:58.860
really believe in our glorious
Lord Jesus Christ?

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:02.173
If a person with gold rings and
fine clothes come into your

00:40:02.173 --> 00:40:04.309
assembly,
and if a poor person in dirty

00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:06.655
clothes also comes in,
you take no notice of the one

00:40:06.655 --> 00:40:08.039
wearing the fine clothes and
say,

00:40:08.039 --> 00:40:09.440
"Have a seat here
please,"

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.039
while to the one who is poor
you say,

00:40:11.039 --> 00:40:13.356
"Stand there,"
or "Sit at my feet,"

00:40:13.356 --> 00:40:15.802
have you not made distinctions
among yourselves and become

00:40:15.802 --> 00:40:17.090
judges with evil thoughts?
 

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:20.177
Listen, my beloved brothers,
has not God chosen the poor in

00:40:20.177 --> 00:40:23.318
the world to be rich in faith
and to be heirs of the kingdom

00:40:23.318 --> 00:40:25.820
that he has promised to those
who love him?

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.690
But you have dishonored the
poor.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.969
Is it not the rich who oppress
you?

00:40:29.969 --> 00:40:31.789
Is it not they who drag you
into court?

00:40:31.789 --> 00:40:34.599
Is it not they who blaspheme
the excellent name that is

00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:35.590
invoked over you?
 

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:40.199
James is written not to the
rich, it's written to the poor.

00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:42.978
It's saying,
don't kow-tow to the rich in

00:40:42.978 --> 00:40:46.800
your town, don't give them the
best places in church.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.822
Look at James 5:1-6,
he gets really heated toward

00:40:49.822 --> 00:40:53.791
the end of the sermon because it
actually reads more like sermon

00:40:53.791 --> 00:40:55.429
than it does a letter.
 

00:40:55.429 --> 00:40:57.202
"Come now you rich
people,"

00:40:57.202 --> 00:41:00.157
now he's talking to the rich
but I think he's kind of talking

00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:02.471
to the rich with the
understanding that his real

00:41:02.471 --> 00:41:03.849
audience are the poor.
 

00:41:03.849 --> 00:41:06.780
He wants them to overhear him
condemn the rich.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.849
…weep and wail for the
miseries that are coming on you.

00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:14.030
Your riches have rotted,
your clothes are moth eaten,

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.831
your gold and silver have
rusted, their rust will be

00:41:16.831 --> 00:41:19.641
evidence against you,
and it will eat your flesh like

00:41:19.641 --> 00:41:19.929
fire.
 

00:41:19.929 --> 00:41:22.550
You have laid up treasure for
the last days.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:23.599
Listen!
 

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:26.539
The wages of the laborers who
mowed your fields,

00:41:26.539 --> 00:41:29.829
which you kept by back by
fraud, cry out,

00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:32.786
and the cries of the harvesters
have reached the ears of the

00:41:32.786 --> 00:41:33.590
Lord of Hosts.
 

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:36.320
You have lived on the earth in
luxury and in pleasure,

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.800
you have fattened your hearts
in a day of slaughter,

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.170
you have condemned and murdered
the righteous one,

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:42.780
who does not resist you.
 

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:47.072
James is written to a Christian
community that's apparently

00:41:47.072 --> 00:41:51.585
either very Jewish or he himself
is writing from a very Jewish

00:41:51.585 --> 00:41:53.510
kind of point of view.
 

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:57.081
He uses this wisdom tradition
of Jewish literature that's

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:59.570
already very well known by the
time--

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:02.030
we've got all kinds of books in
this kind of wisdom tradition.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.961
He uses common sayings,
but notice what kind of context

00:42:04.961 --> 00:42:05.940
he's writing in.
 

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.777
He's writing in a context where
most of the members of his

00:42:08.777 --> 00:42:10.320
church are poor,
not wealthy.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.239
He's writing to condemn the
rich for not taking that into

00:42:14.239 --> 00:42:14.940
account.
 

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:19.793
When James says you can't be
saved by faith apart from works,

00:42:19.793 --> 00:42:23.030
what are the works he's talking
about?

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:24.840
Justice.
 

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:29.797
It's sort of like that bumper
sticker that says you can't have

00:42:29.797 --> 00:42:31.750
peace without justice.
 

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:34.219
Some people running around the
world saying,

00:42:34.219 --> 00:42:35.639
oh let's have peace,
let's have peace,

00:42:35.639 --> 00:42:38.724
let's have peace,
well it's easy to say if you're

00:42:38.724 --> 00:42:41.065
rich,
or you're middle class,

00:42:41.065 --> 00:42:44.400
but if you're poor and you're
oppressed,

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.404
then just hollering about peace
all the time doesn't sound very

00:42:49.404 --> 00:42:51.119
just,
does it?

00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:55.239
The bumper sticker,
if you want peace work for

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:58.260
justice, that's where James is.
 

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.666
What works is for James
doesn't--he's not talking so

00:43:00.666 --> 00:43:02.742
much about circumcision,
the Sabbath,

00:43:02.742 --> 00:43:06.289
keeping Kosher like it seems to
have been for Paul,

00:43:06.289 --> 00:43:09.530
what he's talking about is,
you have to have justice.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:15.467
It's almost as if the writer of
James is in a social situation

00:43:15.467 --> 00:43:21.405
where he didn't have the luxury
of teaching salvation by faith

00:43:21.405 --> 00:43:22.380
alone.
 

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:27.742
He needed to talk about what
you needed to do to supplement

00:43:27.742 --> 00:43:33.197
your belief that God exists with
pursuing justice toward the

00:43:33.197 --> 00:43:34.030
poor.
 

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:39.284
And here's the debate among
scholars, some people have given

00:43:39.284 --> 00:43:44.449
this answer of why James and
Paul don't really disagree.

00:43:44.449 --> 00:43:48.199
Because, as some of you already
picked up, they're working with

00:43:48.199 --> 00:43:51.465
what seem to be different
definitions of both faith and

00:43:51.465 --> 00:43:52.070
works.
 

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:57.376
Clearly, James thinks he's
disagreeing with some kind of

00:43:57.376 --> 00:44:02.972
version of Christianity that
looks an awful lot like Paul's

00:44:02.972 --> 00:44:04.130
letters.
 

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.333
James may think he's
disagreeing with Paul even,

00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:10.536
it's hard to say,
he doesn't ever mention him by

00:44:10.536 --> 00:44:11.150
name.
 

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:14.251
But this writer may indeed
think he's disagreeing with

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:17.585
another form of Christianity
that he may view as dangerous

00:44:17.585 --> 00:44:21.155
because if it teaches you that
you're justified by faith alone

00:44:21.155 --> 00:44:24.527
apart from works,
then that may let a lot of rich

00:44:24.527 --> 00:44:25.860
people off the hook.
 

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.969
They don't have to do anything
to prove their faith.

00:44:29.969 --> 00:44:34.331
James and Paul may indeed still
be in something of a

00:44:34.331 --> 00:44:37.184
disagreement,
although you can see how they

00:44:37.184 --> 00:44:40.050
wouldn't be disagreeing with
each other quite directly.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.992
But James is operating in a
situation where it's almost as

00:44:43.992 --> 00:44:46.760
if he looks at some Gospel that
says,

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.289
you're not saved by works,
you're saved by faith,

00:44:49.289 --> 00:44:50.853
and he says,
well that's nice and

00:44:50.853 --> 00:44:53.588
convenient for those
people who don't want to work

00:44:53.588 --> 00:44:54.369
for justice.
 

00:44:54.369 --> 00:44:58.318
He writes his letter even
interpreting the same verses

00:44:58.318 --> 00:45:02.639
from Genesis that Paul had used
but using them to emphasize

00:45:02.639 --> 00:45:07.034
justice as the work that has to
supplement your faith rather

00:45:07.034 --> 00:45:10.909
than an idea that you're saved
by faith alone.

00:45:10.909 --> 00:45:13.780
So does he disagree with Paul?
 

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:17.460
Maybe yes, maybe no,
maybe it's a little bit of

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.018
both.
 

00:45:18.018 --> 00:45:20.409
Does he have a different view
of law?

00:45:20.409 --> 00:45:22.510
Maybe yes, maybe no.
 

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:28.393
That's for you to decide and to
write your paper about this week

00:45:28.393 --> 00:45:34.090
or make scintillating comments
in your discussion sections.

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:40.760
Questions, comments, outbursts?
 

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.030
We're more than halfway through
the semester;

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:47.369
you're not confused about
anything?

00:45:47.369 --> 00:45:49.130
Good, I'm such a good teacher.
 

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:50.969
See you next week.

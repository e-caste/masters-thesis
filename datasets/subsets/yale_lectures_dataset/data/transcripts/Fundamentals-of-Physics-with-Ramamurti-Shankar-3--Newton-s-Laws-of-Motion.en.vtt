00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.014
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Let me start again

00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:11.390
by reminding you what it is that
was done last time.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.990
If you say, "Can you summarize
for me in a few words the main

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.730
ideas?"
I would like to do that.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.820
What I did last time was to
show you how to handle motion in

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.591
more than one dimension.
I picked for it two dimensions

00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:41.720
as the standard way to explain
it.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.260
By the way, I would like to
make one recommendation.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.144
If you guys are coming in a
little late, don't worry about

00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:50.058
submitting the homework.
Just come in and settle down,

00:00:50.058 --> 00:00:52.923
because it's very hard to
lecture with this amount of

00:00:52.923 --> 00:00:55.379
traffic.
I do try to start a few minutes

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.018
late, but I also have to finish
a few minutes early so you can

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:02.353
go to your next class.
Also, people who come in early

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:05.980
maybe should try to sit in the
middle part of the classroom,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.730
so the latecomers can come in
without too much disruption.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.350
So, summary of last time.
If you live in two dimensions

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.180
or more, you've got to use
vectors to describe most things.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.112
The typical vector is called
V or A or B

00:01:22.112 --> 00:01:26.463
something with an arrow on it.
The most important vector is

00:01:26.463 --> 00:01:30.970
the position vector that tells
you where the object is.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.725
It's got components which are
x and y that could

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:40.103
vary with time.
I and J are unit

00:01:40.103 --> 00:01:43.000
vectors in the x and
y directions.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.330
You can deal with a vector in
one of two ways.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.235
You can either think of it as
an arrow and imagine the arrow,

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:51.850
or you can reduce it to a pair
of numbers, x and

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.394
y.
If you want to add two vectors,

00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:58.099
you can add the arrows by the
rule I gave you or just add the

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.865
components of the two guys to
get the component of the sum and

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:05.895
likewise for the y.
I mentioned something of

00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:10.656
increasing importance only
later, which is that you are

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:13.830
free to pick another set of
axes,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.851
not in the traditional x
and y direction,

00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:20.249
but as an oblique direction.
If you do, the unit vectors are

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.467
called I prime and
J prime,

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:24.629
the components of the vector
change.

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.318
You can imagine that if a
vector is viewed from an angle,

00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:31.810
then its components will vary
with the perspective.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.303
So the components of the vector
are not invariant

00:02:34.303 --> 00:02:38.231
characterizations of the vector.
That is, the vector itself has

00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:40.904
a life of its own.
The components come in the

00:02:40.904 --> 00:02:43.262
minute you pick your axis.
It's not enough to say these

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:44.479
are the components of the
vector;

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:46.589
you've got to tell me,
"I am working with I and

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.660
J, which I define in the
following manner."

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.769
I gave you a law of
transformation of the

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.880
components;
namely, if the vector has

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.347
components ax and
ay in one reference frame

00:02:56.347 --> 00:02:58.505
and ax prime and
ay prime in another

00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:01.080
reference frame,
how are the two related?

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.820
They come from writing I
prime and J prime in

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.136
terms of I and J,
then sticking it in an

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:11.210
expression and identifying the
new representation.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.963
Somehow, when I told you to
invert the transformation,

00:03:13.963 --> 00:03:15.729
some of you had some
difficulty.

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:19.204
Maybe you didn't realize that
they are just simultaneous

00:03:19.204 --> 00:03:22.255
equations that you solve.
Normally, if I tell you

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:25.591
3x + 4y = 6,
and 9x + 6y = 14,

00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:28.845
you know how to solve it.
It's like really the same kind

00:03:28.845 --> 00:03:32.075
of problem, except that the 3
and 4 will all be placed by sin

00:03:32.075 --> 00:03:35.360
φ and cos φ but
they are just the numbers.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.000
You eliminate them the same way
you eliminate them.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.589
I've given you a homework
problem where you can try your

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.929
skills.
When you go today and look at

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.176
the homework,
you'll find the problem from

00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:49.424
the textbook,
one extra problem that deals

00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:53.363
with all of this.
Then, I gave you one other very

00:03:53.363 --> 00:03:58.919
important example of a particle
moving in the xy plane.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.667
x and y can be
whatever you like,

00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:05.012
but I picked a very special
example where x looked

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:07.699
like this: r times cos
ωt.

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:13.689
This times I + r
times sin ωt.

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.449
You should go back and remember
what we did.

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.107
If it took you a while to
digest it, I ask you to think

00:04:19.107 --> 00:04:20.868
harder.
This describes a particle

00:04:20.868 --> 00:04:24.139
that's going around in a circle.
We know it's going around in a

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.790
circle because if I find the
length of this vector,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.735
which is the x-square
part, plus the y-square

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:32.019
part, I just get r^(2) at
all times,

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:34.690
because sine square plus cosine
square is one.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.529
So we know it's moving on a
circle of radius r.

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:41.285
Furthermore,
as time increases,

00:04:41.285 --> 00:04:48.170
the angle, ωt,
is increasing in this fashion.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.079
Omega is called the angle of
velocity.

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:54.211
I related it to the time
period, which is the time it

00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:56.319
takes to go around a full
circle,

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.411
by saying once you've done a
full circle, ωt better

00:05:00.411 --> 00:05:03.435
be 2π.
So this new quantity ω,

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:06.860
which may be new to you,
is related to the time period.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.459
How long does it take to go one
round in this fashion?

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:16.279
You're also free to write it in
terms of the frequency.

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:18.899
The time period and frequency
are reciprocals.

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:22.294
If it takes you 1/60 of a
second to go around once,

00:05:22.294 --> 00:05:24.670
then you do it 60 times a
second.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.500
Omega is really very simple
quantity.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.437
It's related to the frequency
with which you go around the

00:05:31.437 --> 00:05:33.550
circle but is multiplied by
2π.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.852
Why is that?
Frequencies,

00:05:35.852 --> 00:05:39.633
how many times you go around,
and 2π is the rate at

00:05:39.633 --> 00:05:41.980
which the angle is being
changed.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.112
But if every revolution is
worth 2π radians,

00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:48.490
then 2πf is the number
of radians per second.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.310
f is revolutions per
second and 2πf is

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.144
radians per second.
It's called the angle of

00:05:54.144 --> 00:05:56.519
velocity.
The most important result from

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:59.079
last time was that if you took
this r,

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:04.216
and you took two derivatives of
this to find the acceleration,

00:06:04.216 --> 00:06:07.500
d2r over
dt^(2),

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.643
try to do this in your head.
If you took the two derivatives

00:06:11.643 --> 00:06:14.493
of this guy, first time it will
become -ω,

00:06:14.493 --> 00:06:17.528
sin ωt;
second time it will become

00:06:17.528 --> 00:06:20.622
-ω^(2) cos ωt.
In other words,

00:06:20.622 --> 00:06:22.740
it will become -ω^(2)
times itself.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.941
Same thing there.
The final result is the

00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:29.779
acceleration is -ω^(2)
times the position.

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:34.139
That means the acceleration is
pointing towards the center of

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:37.410
the circle and it has a
magnitude a.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.951
When I draw something without
an arrow, I'm talking about the

00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:44.540
magnitude.
It is just ω^(2)r.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.408
I have shown you yesterday that
the speed of the particle as it

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:53.019
goes around the circle is this
(ωr).

00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:55.740
Again, you should make sure you
know how to derive this.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.940
You can do it any way you like.
You can take one full circle

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.204
and realize the distance
traveled is 2πr,

00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:03.279
divide by the time and you will
get this.

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:05.828
Another way,
take the derivative of this,

00:07:05.828 --> 00:07:09.397
get the velocity vector and you
notice his magnitude is a

00:07:09.397 --> 00:07:12.519
constant and the constant will
be ωr.

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:18.085
Whichever way you do it,
you can then rewrite this as

00:07:18.085 --> 00:07:23.753
v^(2) over r.
This is called the centripetal

00:07:23.753 --> 00:07:24.950
acceleration.

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:33.069
This is the acceleration
directed toward the center.

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.089
I told you these are very
important results.

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:36.810
You've got to get this in your
head.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.070
Whenever you see a particle
moving in a circle,

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.790
even if it's at a constant
speed,

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.102
it has an acceleration,
v^(2) over r

00:07:44.102 --> 00:07:47.888
directed towards the center.
This formula doesn't tell you

00:07:47.888 --> 00:07:50.800
which way it's pointing,
because it's a scaler;

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.376
it's not a vector equation.
If you want to write it as a

00:07:55.376 --> 00:07:59.702
vector equation,
you want to write it as

00:07:59.702 --> 00:08:05.914
v^(2) over r
minus--I want to say that it's

00:08:05.914 --> 00:08:11.350
pointing in the direction toward
the center.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:16.136
So sometimes what we do is we
introduce a little vector here

00:08:16.136 --> 00:08:20.459
called e_r.
I'll tell you more about it

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:22.432
later.
e_r is a

00:08:22.432 --> 00:08:26.049
vector at each point of length
one pointing radially away from

00:08:26.049 --> 00:08:28.951
the center.
It's like the unit vector

00:08:28.951 --> 00:08:30.960
I.
Unit vector I points

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.059
away from the origin in the
x direction.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.929
J points away from the
origin in the y

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.705
direction.
e_r is not a

00:08:36.705 --> 00:08:38.264
fixed vector.
At each point,

00:08:38.264 --> 00:08:41.988
e_r is a
different vector pointing in the

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:46.394
radial direction of length one.
The advantage of introducing

00:08:46.394 --> 00:08:51.073
that guy is that if you like,
I can now write an equation for

00:08:51.073 --> 00:08:54.861
the acceleration as a vector.
The magnitude is v^(2)

00:08:54.861 --> 00:08:56.301
over r.
The direction is

00:08:56.301 --> 00:09:00.019
-e_r.
So e_r is a

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:04.120
new entity I've introduced for
convenience.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.919
It plays a big role in
gravitation, in the Coulomb

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:09.171
interaction.
It's good to have a vector

00:09:09.171 --> 00:09:11.850
pointing in the radial direction
of length one.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.649
That's what it is.
That's really the heart of what

00:09:14.649 --> 00:09:17.088
I did last time.
Then we did some projectile

00:09:17.088 --> 00:09:18.638
problems.
You shoot something,

00:09:18.638 --> 00:09:21.364
you should know when it will
land, where it will land,

00:09:21.364 --> 00:09:24.090
with what speed it will land,
how high it will go.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.238
I assume that those problems
are not that difficult and I've

00:09:27.238 --> 00:09:32.532
given you a lot of practice.
Now I'm going to move to the

00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:37.279
really important and central
topic.

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:39.840
I guess you can guess what that
is.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.250
We're going to talk about
Newton's laws.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:47.194
This is a big day in your life.
This is when you learn the laws

00:09:47.194 --> 00:09:50.893
in terms of which you can
understand and explain a large

00:09:50.893 --> 00:09:53.701
number of phenomena.
In fact, until we do

00:09:53.701 --> 00:09:56.413
electricity and magnetism the
next semester,

00:09:56.413 --> 00:10:00.259
everything's going to be based
on just the laws of Newton.

00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:03.811
It's really amazing that
somebody could condense that

00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:06.612
much information into a few,
namely three,

00:10:06.612 --> 00:10:09.786
different laws.
That's what we're going to talk

00:10:09.786 --> 00:10:11.929
about.
Let's start.

00:10:11.929 --> 00:10:15.289
Your reaction may be that
you've seen Newton's laws,

00:10:15.289 --> 00:10:19.018
you applied them in school.
I've got to tell you that I

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:22.721
realized fairly late in life
they are more subtle than I

00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:25.905
imagined the first time.
It's one thing to plug in all

00:10:25.905 --> 00:10:28.117
the numbers and say,
"I know Newton's laws and I

00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:30.948
know how they work."
But as you get older and you

00:10:30.948 --> 00:10:34.258
have a lot of spare time,
you think about what you are

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:36.251
doing,
which is something I have the

00:10:36.251 --> 00:10:38.866
luxury of doing right now,
and I realized this is more

00:10:38.866 --> 00:10:41.006
tricky.
I want to share some of that

00:10:41.006 --> 00:10:44.535
with you so you can fast forward
and get the understanding it

00:10:44.535 --> 00:10:47.199
took me much longer to get.
That's what I'm going to

00:10:47.199 --> 00:10:49.110
emphasize, more than just
plugging in the numbers.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.689
Of course, we have to also know
how to plug in the numbers so we

00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:56.323
can pass all the tests,
but it's good to understand the

00:10:56.323 --> 00:10:59.179
nature of the edifice set up by
Newton.

00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:03.610
First statement by Newton--I
don't feel like writing it down.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:07.160
It's too long and everybody
knows what the law is.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.650
It's called the Law of Inertia.
Let me just say it and talk

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:15.854
about it.
The Law of Inertia says that,

00:11:15.854 --> 00:11:22.421
"If a body has no forces acting
on it, then it will remain at

00:11:22.421 --> 00:11:26.799
rest if it was at rest to begin
with,

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:30.564
or if it had a velocity to
begin with, it will maintain

00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:33.587
that velocity."
One way to say it is,

00:11:33.587 --> 00:11:38.401
every body will continue to
remain in a state of rest or

00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:41.639
uniform motion in a straight
line.

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:44.782
That's another way of saying
maintaining velocity if it's not

00:11:44.782 --> 00:11:48.441
acted upon by a force.
What makes the law surprising

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:53.574
is that if I only gave you half
the law, namely every body will

00:11:53.574 --> 00:11:57.880
remain at rest if it's not acted
upon by a force,

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.565
you will say, "That's fine.
I accept that,

00:11:59.565 --> 00:12:01.523
because here's something.
You leave it there,

00:12:01.523 --> 00:12:03.950
it doesn't move.
It's not a big surprise."

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.519
People were used to that from
the time of Aristotle.

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:10.570
But Aristotle used to think
that if you want something to

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.259
move, there has to be some
agency making it move.

00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:16.549
That agency you could call
force.

00:12:16.549 --> 00:12:20.335
The great discovery that
Galileo and Newton made is that

00:12:20.335 --> 00:12:23.915
you don't need a force for a
body to move at constant

00:12:23.915 --> 00:12:27.210
velocity.
It's very clear you don't need

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.929
a force if something is doing
nothing, just sitting there.

00:12:31.929 --> 00:12:35.067
The fact that you don't need a
force for it to move forever at

00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:36.970
a given speed in a given
direction,

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.724
that's not obvious,
because in daily life you don't

00:12:39.724 --> 00:12:40.974
see that.
In daily life,

00:12:40.974 --> 00:12:43.599
everything seems to come to
rest unless you push it or you

00:12:43.599 --> 00:12:45.580
pull it or you exert some kind
of force.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.965
But we all know that the reason
things come to a halt when you

00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:53.306
push them is,
there eventually is some

00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:55.549
friction or drag or something
bringing them to rest.

00:12:55.549 --> 00:12:58.256
Somehow, if you could
manufacture a really smooth

00:12:58.256 --> 00:13:01.132
frictionless surface,
that if you took a hockey puck

00:13:01.132 --> 00:13:04.460
or something and an air cushion
and you give it a push,

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.090
in some idealized world,
it'll travel forever.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:13.730
So it's hard to realize that in
the terrestrial situation.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.049
But Galileo already managed to
find examples where things would

00:13:17.049 --> 00:13:19.029
roll on for a very,
very long time.

00:13:19.029 --> 00:13:21.822
Nowadays, if you go to outer
space, you can check for

00:13:21.822 --> 00:13:23.970
yourself that if you throw
something out,

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.870
it just goes on forever without
your intervention.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:31.490
It's in the nature of things to
go at a constant velocity.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:35.720
They don't need your help to do
that.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.548
You have to be careful that
this first law of Newton is not

00:13:40.548 --> 00:13:44.258
valid for everybody.
In fact, I'll give an example

00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:48.470
in your own life where you will
find that this law doesn't work.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:52.689
Here is the situation.
You go on an airplane and then

00:13:52.689 --> 00:13:56.981
after the usual delays,
the plane begins to accelerate

00:13:56.981 --> 00:13:59.595
down the runway.
At that instant,

00:13:59.595 --> 00:14:03.494
if you leave anything on the
floor, you know it's no longer

00:14:03.494 --> 00:14:05.379
yours.
It's going to slide down and

00:14:05.379 --> 00:14:07.940
the guy in the last row is going
to collect everything.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.315
Why is that?
Because we find in that plane,

00:14:12.315 --> 00:14:16.126
when objects are left at what
you think is at rest with no

00:14:16.126 --> 00:14:19.632
external agency acting on them,
they all slide backwards

00:14:19.632 --> 00:14:21.430
towards the rear end of the
plane.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.663
That happens during takeoff.
That doesn't happen in flight,

00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:28.319
but it happens during takeoff.
That is an example of a person

00:14:28.319 --> 00:14:31.629
for whom the Law of Inertia does
not work.

00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:34.679
This is something you guys may
not have realized.

00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:36.929
Newton's laws are not for
everybody.

00:14:36.929 --> 00:14:40.730
You have to be what's called an
"inertial observer."

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:45.331
If you're an inertial observer,
then in your system of

00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:50.019
reference, objects left at rest
will remain at rest.

00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:53.646
The plane that's ready to take
off or is taking off is not such

00:14:53.646 --> 00:14:55.953
a system.
The Earth seems to be a pretty

00:14:55.953 --> 00:14:58.337
good inertial system,
because on the ground,

00:14:58.337 --> 00:15:00.500
you leave something,
it stays there.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.084
It depends on what you leave.
If you leave your iPod,

00:15:07.084 --> 00:15:08.909
it's not going to stay there
for very long.

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:11.721
But then you can trace it to
some external forces,

00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:15.302
which are carrying your iPod.
But if you don't do anything,

00:15:15.302 --> 00:15:18.299
things stay.
Here is the main point.

00:15:18.299 --> 00:15:20.924
The point of Newton is,
two things in the Law of

00:15:20.924 --> 00:15:23.269
Inertia, which one may think is
trivial.

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:26.327
First, free velocity,
constant velocity can be

00:15:26.327 --> 00:15:29.250
obtained for free without doing
anything.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.889
There are people for whom this
is true.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.189
For example,
in outer space,

00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:35.293
you've got an astronaut.
You send something,

00:15:35.293 --> 00:15:39.340
you'll find it goes on forever.
Here's another thing.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.946
If you find one inertial
observer, namely one person for

00:15:42.946 --> 00:15:46.948
whom this Law of Inertia works,
I can manufacture for you an

00:15:46.948 --> 00:15:50.560
infinite number of other people
for whom this is true.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.217
Who are these other people?
Do you know what I'm talking

00:15:54.217 --> 00:15:57.000
about?
If I give you one observer for

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.962
whom the Law of Inertia is true,
I say that others for whom is

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:04.360
also true.
Yes?

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.939
Student:
[inaudible]

00:16:05.939 --> 00:16:09.340
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Did you hear that?

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.000
Let me repeat that.
First of all,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.018
if the Law of Inertia is valid
for me, it's valid for other

00:16:16.018 --> 00:16:19.759
people in the same room at rest
with respect to me.

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:21.845
Because if I think it's not
moving, you think it's not

00:16:21.845 --> 00:16:23.620
moving.
That's just fine.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.058
But suppose you are in a train
and you're moving past me and

00:16:27.058 --> 00:16:30.327
you look at this piece of chalk.
Of course, everything in my

00:16:30.327 --> 00:16:34.079
room is going backwards for you.
But things which were at rest

00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:37.688
will move at a constant
velocity, opposite of the

00:16:37.688 --> 00:16:40.769
velocity that you have relative
to me.

00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:45.418
You will find that objects that
are at constant initial velocity

00:16:45.418 --> 00:16:49.467
maintain the velocity.
If I am an inertial observer,

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:54.257
another person moving relative
to me at constant velocity will

00:16:54.257 --> 00:16:58.399
also be an inertial observer.
Why?

00:16:58.399 --> 00:17:02.238
Because any velocity I ascribe
to a particle or an object,

00:17:02.238 --> 00:17:06.412
you will add a certain constant
to it by the law of composition

00:17:06.412 --> 00:17:08.920
of velocity.
All velocities I see you will

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.930
add a certain number to get the
velocities according to you.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.732
But adding a constant velocity
to objects does not change the

00:17:15.732 --> 00:17:19.218
fact that those which were
maintaining constant velocity

00:17:19.218 --> 00:17:21.690
still maintain a constant
velocity.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.640
It's a different constant
velocity.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.853
In particular,
the things that I say are at

00:17:25.853 --> 00:17:28.964
rest, you will say are moving
backwards at the velocity that

00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:31.936
you have relative to me.
Things that I say are going at

00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:34.279
50 miles per hour you may say
are going at 80.

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:37.650
But 50 is a constant and 80 is
a constant.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:41.014
Therefore, it's not that
there's only one fortunate

00:17:41.014 --> 00:17:44.337
family of inertial observers.
There's infinite number of

00:17:44.337 --> 00:17:46.860
them, but they're all moving
relative to each other at

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.528
constant velocity.
If the Earth is an inertial

00:17:49.528 --> 00:17:52.494
frame of reference,
if you go in a train relative

00:17:52.494 --> 00:17:56.140
to the Earth at constant
velocity, you're also inertial.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.882
But if you go on a plane which
is accelerating,

00:17:59.882 --> 00:18:03.720
you're no longer inertial.
That's the main point.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.700
The point is that there are
inertial frames of reference.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.490
You must know the Earth is not
precisely inertial.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.200
The Earth has an acceleration.

00:18:16.349 --> 00:18:18.820
Can you tell me why I'm sure
the Earth has an acceleration?

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.947
Yes?
Student:

00:18:24.947 --> 00:18:25.579
Because it's moving in a
circle.

00:18:25.579 --> 00:18:27.098
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: It's going around

00:18:27.098 --> 00:18:28.799
the Sun.
Let's imagine it's a circular

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:30.647
orbit.
Then we've just shown here,

00:18:30.647 --> 00:18:32.880
it's an accelerated frame of
reference.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.905
It just turns out that if you
put the v^(2) and you put

00:18:35.905 --> 00:18:38.040
the r,
and r is 93 million

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.034
miles, you will find the
acceleration is small enough for

00:18:41.034 --> 00:18:43.077
us to ignore.
But there are effects of the

00:18:43.077 --> 00:18:45.069
Earth's acceleration,
which we'll demonstrate.

00:18:45.069 --> 00:18:48.185
The Focault pendulum is one
example where you can see that

00:18:48.185 --> 00:18:50.589
the Earth is rotating around its
own axis.

00:18:50.589 --> 00:18:53.450
Then, the fact that the Earth
is going around the Sun.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.642
All of them mean it's really
not inertial,

00:18:55.642 --> 00:18:57.460
but it's approximately
inertial.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.781
But if you go to outer space
nowadays, you can find truly

00:19:00.781 --> 00:19:06.339
inertial frames of reference.
That's the first law.

00:19:06.339 --> 00:19:07.584
The first law,
if you want,

00:19:07.584 --> 00:19:09.977
if you want to say,
"Okay what's the summary of all

00:19:09.977 --> 00:19:12.453
of this?"
The summary is that constant

00:19:12.453 --> 00:19:14.769
velocity doesn't require
anything.

00:19:14.769 --> 00:19:19.045
The reason it looks like a
tautology, because you look

00:19:19.045 --> 00:19:23.319
around, nothing seems to have
its velocity forever.

00:19:23.319 --> 00:19:24.973
Then you say,
"Oh, that's because there's a

00:19:24.973 --> 00:19:27.066
force acting on it."
It looks like a tautology

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:29.812
because you're never able to
show me something that moves

00:19:29.812 --> 00:19:32.846
forever at a constant velocity,
because every time you don't

00:19:32.846 --> 00:19:34.554
find such a thing,
I give an excuse,

00:19:34.554 --> 00:19:37.349
namely, a force is acting.
But it's not a big con,

00:19:37.349 --> 00:19:40.410
because you can set up
experiments in free space far

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.546
from everything,
where objects will,

00:19:42.546 --> 00:19:44.750
in fact, maintain their
velocity forever.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:48.330
That's a possibility.
It's a useful concept on the

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.640
Earth, because Earth is
approximately inertial.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.789
Now, we have come to the second
law, which is "the law."

00:19:56.789 --> 00:20:00.059
This is the law that we all
memorize and learn.

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:03.467
It says that,
"If a body has an acceleration,

00:20:03.467 --> 00:20:07.570
then you need a force and the
relation of the force to

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.519
acceleration is this thing:
F = ma" Now,

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:14.309
I have to say a few words about
units.

00:20:14.309 --> 00:20:18.390
Acceleration is measured in
meters per second squared.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:22.759
Mass is measured in kilograms.
So, the way to measure force is

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:24.809
in kilogram meters per second
squared.

00:20:24.809 --> 00:20:28.236
But we get tired of saying that
long expression,

00:20:28.236 --> 00:20:31.589
so we're going to call that a
Newton, right?

00:20:31.589 --> 00:20:34.764
If you invented it,
we'd call it whatever your name

00:20:34.764 --> 00:20:38.319
is, but this is the guy who
invented it, so it's called a

00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:41.049
Newton, usually denoted by a
capital N.

00:20:41.049 --> 00:20:46.162
A typical problem that you may
have done in your first pass at

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:49.619
Newton's law,
someone tells you a force of 36

00:20:49.619 --> 00:20:53.450
Newtons is acting on a mass of
whatever, 4 kilograms;

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.365
what's the acceleration?
You divide and you find it's 9

00:20:56.365 --> 00:20:58.708
and you say, "Okay,
I know what to do with Newton's

00:20:58.708 --> 00:21:00.787
laws."
That's where I want to tell you

00:21:00.787 --> 00:21:03.299
that it's actually more
complicated than that.

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:06.740
Let's really look at this
equation.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.077
Take yourself back to
1600-whatever,

00:21:09.077 --> 00:21:11.950
whenever Newton was inventing
these laws.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.490
You don't know any of these
laws.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.980
You have an intuitive
definition of force.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.030
You sort of know what force is.
Somebody pushes you or pulls

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.460
you.
That's a force.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:25.190
Suddenly, you are told there is
a law.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.673
Are you better off in any way?
"Can you do anything with this

00:21:28.673 --> 00:21:29.900
law?"
is what I'm asking you.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.001
What can you do with this law?
I give you Newton's law and

00:21:32.001 --> 00:21:34.010
say, "Good luck."
What will you do?

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:38.680
What does it help you predict?
Can you even tell if it's true?

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.890
Here's a body that's moving,
right?

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.460
I want you to tell me,
is Newton right?

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.206
How are we going to check that?
Well, you want to measure the

00:21:48.206 --> 00:21:50.579
left-hand side and you want to
measure the right-hand side.

00:21:50.579 --> 00:21:52.526
If they're equal,
maybe you will say the law is

00:21:52.526 --> 00:21:56.332
working.
What can you measure in this

00:21:56.332 --> 00:21:58.214
equation?
Student:

00:21:58.214 --> 00:21:59.700
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.631
Shankar: Pardon me?
Student:

00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:03.275
Force and acceleration.
Professor Ramamurti

00:22:03.275 --> 00:22:05.599
Shankar: All right.
Let's start with acceleration.

00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:09.293
What's your plan for measuring
acceleration if some little

00:22:09.293 --> 00:22:12.400
thing is moving?
What do you need to measure it?

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.670
Student:
The change in velocity over the

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.774
change [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:22:14.774 --> 00:22:16.895
Shankar: Right,
but what instruments will you

00:22:16.895 --> 00:22:19.192
need to measure it?
You are supposed to really

00:22:19.192 --> 00:22:21.420
measure it.
What will you ask me for?

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.339
Student: A watch.
Professor Ramamurti

00:22:24.339 --> 00:22:26.880
Shankar: A watch?
Yes.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.686
Student:
[inaudible]

00:22:27.686 --> 00:22:29.299
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: And what else?

00:22:29.299 --> 00:22:29.708
Student:
[inaudible]

00:22:29.708 --> 00:22:30.430
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: A ruler?

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.440
Okay.
That's right.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.320
You don't mean Queen Elizabeth,
right?

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.864
You mean-- Very good.
What you really want--a ruler

00:22:39.864 --> 00:22:42.809
may not be enough,
but maybe it's enough.

00:22:42.809 --> 00:22:45.642
So here's the long ruler and
here's this thing moving,

00:22:45.642 --> 00:22:49.627
right?
You ask for a Rolex so here's

00:22:49.627 --> 00:22:52.630
your watch.
It's telling time.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:56.590
Tell me exactly what you want
to do to measure acceleration.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.540
What do you have to do?
I want the acceleration now.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:06.050
What will you measure?
Okay, you go ahead.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:08.414
You can try.
Student:

00:23:08.414 --> 00:23:10.623
[inaudible]
Student:

00:23:10.623 --> 00:23:14.022
[inaudible]
I would start with the object

00:23:14.022 --> 00:23:18.271
at rest and then [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:23.030
Shankar: It may not be at
rest to begin with.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.830
It's doing its thing.
It's going at some speed.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.481
Yes?
Student:

00:23:27.481 --> 00:23:30.503
Measure the distance it travels
over a constant interval of

00:23:30.503 --> 00:23:31.413
time?
Professor Ramamurti

00:23:31.413 --> 00:23:32.400
Shankar: That'll give you
the velocity.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.853
Student:
Well, if you do distance after

00:23:34.853 --> 00:23:38.233
one second versus distance over
the next second versus distance

00:23:38.233 --> 00:23:40.960
over a third second,
you see how it increases.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.759
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Good,

00:23:41.759 --> 00:23:43.529
in principle.
Let me repeat what he said.

00:23:43.529 --> 00:23:45.939
He said, first,
let it go a little distance,

00:23:45.939 --> 00:23:49.329
take the distance over time.
That gives you the velocity now.

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:51.871
Let it go a little more,
that gives you the velocity

00:23:51.871 --> 00:23:53.893
later.
Take the difference of the two

00:23:53.893 --> 00:23:56.925
velocities and divide by the
difference of the two times,

00:23:56.925 --> 00:23:58.819
and you've got the
acceleration.

00:23:58.819 --> 00:24:03.230
Of course, you have allowed it
to move a finite distance in a

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.066
finite time.
What you should imagine doing

00:24:06.066 --> 00:24:08.994
is making these three
measurements more and more

00:24:08.994 --> 00:24:11.359
quickly.
You need three positional

00:24:11.359 --> 00:24:13.354
measurements.
Now, a little later,

00:24:13.354 --> 00:24:16.202
and a little later later,
because between the first and

00:24:16.202 --> 00:24:17.530
second,
you get a velocity,

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:19.509
the second and third you get
another velocity.

00:24:19.509 --> 00:24:23.909
Their difference divided by the
difference in times is going to

00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:27.563
be the acceleration.
But if you imagine making these

00:24:27.563 --> 00:24:30.467
measurements more and more and
more quickly,

00:24:30.467 --> 00:24:33.844
in the end, you can measure
what you can say is the

00:24:33.844 --> 00:24:37.168
acceleration now.
That's the meaning of the limit

00:24:37.168 --> 00:24:39.222
in calculus.
You take Δx and you

00:24:39.222 --> 00:24:40.695
take Δt.
What's the meaning of

00:24:40.695 --> 00:24:41.900
Δx and Δt going
to 0?

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.930
It means, measure them as
quickly as you can.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.392
In the real world,
no one's going to measure it

00:24:47.392 --> 00:24:49.855
instantaneously,
but we can make the difference

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:52.071
as small as we like.
Mathematically,

00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:54.029
we can make it 0.
In that limit,

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:56.130
we can measure velocity right
now.

00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:00.505
That means we can also measure
velocity slightly later and make

00:25:00.505 --> 00:25:04.670
the slightly later come as close
to right now as we want.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.970
Then, that ratio will give you
acceleration.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.989
Acceleration is the easiest
thing to measure of these three

00:25:10.989 --> 00:25:13.637
quantities.
We all have a good intuitive

00:25:13.637 --> 00:25:15.759
feeling for what acceleration
is.

00:25:15.759 --> 00:25:19.799
You want to test if what Newton
told you is right.

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:23.377
You see an object in motion,
you find a and you give

00:25:23.377 --> 00:25:26.769
a a certain numerical
value, 10 meters per second

00:25:26.769 --> 00:25:29.036
squared.
But that's not yet testing the

00:25:29.036 --> 00:25:31.530
equation, because you've got to
find both sides.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:36.720
What about the mass?
What's the mass of this object?

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.410
Anybody want to try from this
section here?

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.131
Yes?
Student:

00:25:44.131 --> 00:25:47.616
You could use some sort of a
standard unit of mass and then a

00:25:47.616 --> 00:25:50.230
balance to measure the mass of
something else,

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.367
like put it at a certain
distance from the fulcrum on a

00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:56.039
scale and figure out the
relative mass.

00:25:56.039 --> 00:25:56.970
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:01.596
His idea was the following.
You take a standard mass and

00:26:01.596 --> 00:26:05.971
you maybe go to a seesaw.
You put the standard mass here

00:26:05.971 --> 00:26:09.571
and you put some other fellow at
the mass you're looking at

00:26:09.571 --> 00:26:11.542
there.
You add just the lengths and

00:26:11.542 --> 00:26:13.912
when it balances,
you can sort of tell what this

00:26:13.912 --> 00:26:17.599
mass is, right?
But suppose you were in outer

00:26:17.599 --> 00:26:20.299
space.
There's no gravity.

00:26:20.299 --> 00:26:23.531
Then the seesaw will balance,
even if you put a potato on one

00:26:23.531 --> 00:26:25.740
side and an elephant on the
other side.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.005
You cannot tell the mass,
because what you are doing now

00:26:29.005 --> 00:26:32.627
is appealing to the notion of
mass as something that's related

00:26:32.627 --> 00:26:35.180
to the pull of the Earth on the
object.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.477
But Newton's law is--You see,
you've got to go back and wipe

00:26:38.477 --> 00:26:41.077
out everything you know.
If this is what you have,

00:26:41.077 --> 00:26:43.509
there is no mention of the
Earth in these equations.

00:26:43.509 --> 00:26:45.880
Yet, the notion of mass is
defined.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.410
It's not talking about the
gravitational pull of the Earth

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.299
on an object.
Yes?

00:26:51.299 --> 00:26:53.969
Student:
If you had an object that you

00:26:53.969 --> 00:26:57.790
say has a certain mass that you
don't know and then you took one

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:01.066
that's the same density,
but say twice the size and you

00:27:01.066 --> 00:27:03.869
can see if it slows the force.
Professor Ramamurti

00:27:03.869 --> 00:27:05.559
Shankar: But do you know
what the force on the body is?

00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:08.600
We don't know how to measure
that either;

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.361
do you agree?
We don't know what the force

00:27:10.361 --> 00:27:12.522
is, because we are hoping to say
force is going to be m

00:27:12.522 --> 00:27:14.103
times a.
We're just getting on to

00:27:14.103 --> 00:27:16.277
measuring m.
It looks like a circular

00:27:16.277 --> 00:27:18.849
definition right now.
Yes?

00:27:18.849 --> 00:27:21.471
Student:
Do you mean what material this

00:27:21.471 --> 00:27:24.034
object is made of and its
density [inaudible]

00:27:24.034 --> 00:27:26.540
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Ah,

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.130
but density is mass over volume.
But we don't know the mass,

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.408
right?
Student:

00:27:32.408 --> 00:27:34.143
But if you use the density of
that [inaudible]

00:27:34.143 --> 00:27:36.226
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: How is anyone going

00:27:36.226 --> 00:27:37.730
to give you a density of
anything?

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.359
We're just asking what's the
mass of any object?

00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:43.391
We have not yet found a
satisfactory answer to what's

00:27:43.391 --> 00:27:46.109
the mass of an object?
Yes?

00:27:46.109 --> 00:27:47.992
Student:
Are we still operating in outer

00:27:47.992 --> 00:27:48.688
space?
Professor Ramamurti

00:27:48.688 --> 00:27:49.977
Shankar: Yes.
This cannot depend on the

00:27:49.977 --> 00:27:51.784
planet Earth.
Student:

00:27:51.784 --> 00:27:54.126
Could we have,
by any chance,

00:27:54.126 --> 00:27:55.795
a spring?
Professor Ramamurti

00:27:55.795 --> 00:27:56.822
Shankar: Yes.
Student:

00:27:56.822 --> 00:27:58.463
Whose spring constant and the
definition [inaudible]

00:27:58.463 --> 00:28:00.040
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: I'm sorry.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:04.380
What did you just say?
You can have a spring.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.738
Student:
Yeah, you could have a spring

00:28:06.738 --> 00:28:09.900
and you could compare how fast
that objects will travel when

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.955
the spring is compressed and
they're placed against it and

00:28:12.955 --> 00:28:15.849
released, but you'd only have a
comparison then.

00:28:15.849 --> 00:28:16.510
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:19.480
Let me repeat what he said.
He said, take a spring to outer

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.789
space and we'll hook up some
objects to them and see how fast

00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:26.722
they move and do a comparison.
That's fairly close to what I

00:28:26.722 --> 00:28:30.703
had in mind.
But it's not the word perfect

00:28:30.703 --> 00:28:32.621
answer.
I just want to take some time

00:28:32.621 --> 00:28:34.289
thinking about it.
Yes?

00:28:34.289 --> 00:28:35.839
Student:
[inaudible]

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:38.818
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: What do I learn

00:28:38.818 --> 00:28:40.532
from the period?
Student:

00:28:40.532 --> 00:28:41.682
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:28:41.682 --> 00:28:43.565
Shankar: How?
Student:

00:28:43.565 --> 00:28:46.173
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:28:46.173 --> 00:28:50.361
Shankar: Remember,
you cannot peek into chapters 6

00:28:50.361 --> 00:28:53.680
and 7, because you've seen it
before.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.058
I'm asking you if somebody
wrote apparently Shakespeare's

00:28:58.058 --> 00:29:00.369
plays for him;
it's one of the rumors, right?

00:29:00.369 --> 00:29:03.583
Suppose Newton comes to you and
says, "I have this great law,

00:29:03.583 --> 00:29:06.100
but I don't want to publish it
under my name.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.383
I'm going to give it to you."
You have got this new law,

00:29:09.383 --> 00:29:11.480
but how are you going to sell
this?

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.119
You've got to tell people how
to use it.

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:17.303
You realize it's very subtle,
because the very first thing in

00:29:17.303 --> 00:29:19.001
that equation,
which is m,

00:29:19.001 --> 00:29:22.594
has not yet been defined.
He gave an answer which is

00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:25.410
fairly close.
It doesn't rely on gravity.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.970
It doesn't rely on the planet.
You cannot say to me,

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.628
"Take a force,
due to a spring,

00:29:29.628 --> 00:29:32.888
and see what force it applies
and divide by the acceleration

00:29:32.888 --> 00:29:35.186
and get the mass,"
because we haven't defined

00:29:35.186 --> 00:29:37.600
force either.
You've got to realize that.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.762
Let me ask you something.
How do we decide how long a

00:29:41.762 --> 00:29:43.118
meter is?
Can you tell me,

00:29:43.118 --> 00:29:44.640
how do you know how long a
meter is?

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.740
Student:
It's just sort of arbitrary.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.849
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

00:29:47.849 --> 00:29:49.501
Student:
You can just pick an arbitrary

00:29:49.501 --> 00:29:50.602
mass, as well,
like one object,

00:29:50.602 --> 00:29:52.147
which is an arbitrary mass.
Professor Ramamurti

00:29:52.147 --> 00:29:54.149
Shankar: And we'll call it.
First thing you've got to do

00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:57.019
is, realize that some of these
things are not God-given.

00:29:57.019 --> 00:30:00.819
A meter, for example,
is not deduced from anything.

00:30:00.819 --> 00:30:03.471
Napoleon or somebody said,
"The size of my ego is one

00:30:03.471 --> 00:30:06.220
meter."
That's a new unit of length.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.920
You take a material like silver
and put it in a glass case and

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.470
that's the definition of a
meter.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:14.279
It's not right or wrong.
Then I ask you,

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:16.470
"What is two meters and what is
three meters?"

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.198
We have ways of doing that.
I take the meter and put it

00:30:19.198 --> 00:30:20.970
next to the meter,
that's two meters.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.475
I cut it in half,
I'll use some protractors and

00:30:23.475 --> 00:30:26.253
dividers and compasses,
you can split the meter into

00:30:26.253 --> 00:30:29.202
any fraction you like.
Likewise for mass,

00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:34.138
we will take a chunk of some
material and we will call it a

00:30:34.138 --> 00:30:36.720
kilogram.
I should give you some hint.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.050
That kilogram,
I don't expect you to deduce.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.497
That is a matter of convention.
Just like one second is some

00:30:42.497 --> 00:30:45.779
convention we use and one meter
is some convention we use.

00:30:45.779 --> 00:30:47.799
I'm going to give you a little
help.

00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:51.943
I'm going to give you a glass
case and in the glass case is an

00:30:51.943 --> 00:30:55.339
entity with this as one
kilogram, by definition.

00:30:55.339 --> 00:31:00.280
Then I give you another object,
an elephant.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.549
Here's an elephant.
I'm telling you,

00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:04.080
"What's the mass of the
elephant?"

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:10.093
How do you find this mass?
You got to take the hint he

00:31:10.093 --> 00:31:13.108
gave.
I give you a spring and an

00:31:13.108 --> 00:31:17.130
elephant.
What should we do?

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:18.815
Yes?
Student:

00:31:18.815 --> 00:31:20.244
Measure how far,
if you hung an elephant from a

00:31:20.244 --> 00:31:21.487
spring [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:31:21.487 --> 00:31:23.459
Shankar: No.
Remember, when we hang the

00:31:23.459 --> 00:31:26.150
elephant in outer space,
nothing is going to happen.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.856
Student: Okay.
You push the elephant and

00:31:29.856 --> 00:31:34.841
measure how far-- what the
distance from the unstretched

00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:40.190
spring is that the elephant
travels in either direction.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.160
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.471
Student:
Then, you also do that with one

00:31:43.471 --> 00:31:45.329
kilogram.
It should be proportional to

00:31:45.329 --> 00:31:47.540
how far from the resting state
of the spring.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.554
That should be the proportion
that the one kilogram object is

00:31:50.554 --> 00:31:52.238
to the other.
Professor Ramamurti

00:31:52.238 --> 00:31:53.809
Shankar: When you say,
"push the elephant," you want

00:31:53.809 --> 00:31:56.349
to push it in a particular way?
What do you want to do?

00:31:56.349 --> 00:31:57.789
Student:
Towards the [inaudible]

00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:59.267
to compress the spring or to
[inaudible]

00:31:59.267 --> 00:32:01.390
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: That is correct,

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:03.180
but you don't want to give it a
definite push.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.151
Yes?
Student:

00:32:05.151 --> 00:32:09.180
Do you push it radially along
the axis of the spring,

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:13.440
because you know that the
centripetal force is mv^(2) is

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.952
over t.
Professor Ramamurti

00:32:15.952 --> 00:32:18.542
Shankar: Yeah.
Maybe that's an interesting

00:32:18.542 --> 00:32:19.660
thing.
That's correct.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.632
You can do that, too.
Let me now put you out of your

00:32:23.632 --> 00:32:25.891
suspense.
I think I've heard bits and

00:32:25.891 --> 00:32:28.765
pieces of the answer everywhere,
so I don't want to wait until

00:32:28.765 --> 00:32:31.050
we get it word-perfect.
The point is,

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:34.640
the one kilogram is a matter of
convention.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.670
We want to know what is the
mass of the elephant.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.862
We can do the seesaw
experiment, you suggested,

00:32:40.862 --> 00:32:42.864
but the seesaw experiment
requires gravity,

00:32:42.864 --> 00:32:45.507
so we don't want to do that.
A spring will,

00:32:45.507 --> 00:32:48.220
on the other hand,
exert a force.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.250
We don't know what the force of
the spring is.

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.228
If you assume that,
you are not playing by the

00:32:52.228 --> 00:32:54.470
rule, because we don't know what
force it exerts.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:57.549
We do know it exerts a force,
so here's what you do.

00:32:57.549 --> 00:33:02.369
You hook one end of the spring
to a wall and you pull it from

00:33:02.369 --> 00:33:07.027
rest by some amount and you
attach the one kilogram mass to

00:33:07.027 --> 00:33:09.269
it.
Yes?

00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:11.634
Student:
One problem that we'd have,

00:33:11.634 --> 00:33:14.788
though, is if we're in outer
space, where are we going to

00:33:14.788 --> 00:33:17.157
find a wall that won't move?
Professor Ramamurti

00:33:17.157 --> 00:33:18.190
Shankar: A wall that will
not move?

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:20.572
Student:
Actually, if you hook it up to

00:33:20.572 --> 00:33:22.373
any wall in outer space
[inaudible]

00:33:22.373 --> 00:33:25.180
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: You're right.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.935
What can actually happen is
that if you're in an enormous

00:33:28.935 --> 00:33:32.490
laboratory, which is made up of
an enormous object,

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.677
then you will find that you
can, in fact,

00:33:34.677 --> 00:33:37.117
attach it to the wall.
You can go in outer space--

00:33:37.117 --> 00:33:38.829
Student:
It won't move very much?

00:33:38.829 --> 00:33:39.382
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

00:33:39.382 --> 00:33:41.194
it won't move very much.
Once we know enough dynamics,

00:33:41.194 --> 00:33:44.156
we can answer your question.
Does outer space even rob you

00:33:44.156 --> 00:33:46.630
of something to which you can
anchor a spring?

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:49.250
The answer is, "no."
You can anchor things to

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:52.863
objects in outer space.
They just won't act the way

00:33:52.863 --> 00:33:55.282
gravity does.
But you can nail it to the wall

00:33:55.282 --> 00:33:57.650
and pull one end.
So you pull one end.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.660
We don't know what force it
exerts.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:04.575
But it exerts some force.
Now, I tie this one kilogram

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:08.420
mass to it and let it go.
I find the acceleration.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.610
That is the force which I do
not know in magnitude.

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:18.550
But this is the acceleration of
the one kilogram mass.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:22.974
Then, I bring the elephant and
I pull the spring by the same

00:34:22.974 --> 00:34:26.949
amount and I find the
acceleration of the elephant and

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:31.300
the denominator is obviously the
mass of the elephant.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:36.309
The force is not known,
but it's the same force.

00:34:36.309 --> 00:34:40.496
So, when I divide these two
numbers, I'm going to find

00:34:40.496 --> 00:34:44.999
a_1 over
a_E is equal to

00:34:44.999 --> 00:34:48.080
m_E over
m,

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:53.348
which is the one kilogram mass.
What we needed was some

00:34:53.348 --> 00:34:58.860
mechanism of exerting some fixed
force.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.929
We didn't have to know its
magnitude.

00:35:00.929 --> 00:35:05.428
But the acceleration it
produces on the elephant and on

00:35:05.428 --> 00:35:09.760
the mass, are in an inverse
ratio of their masses.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.401
If you knew this was one
kilogram, then the acceleration

00:35:12.401 --> 00:35:14.658
of the elephant,
which will be some tiny number,

00:35:14.658 --> 00:35:16.579
maybe 100^(th) of what this guy
did;

00:35:16.579 --> 00:35:18.370
the mass of the elephant is
then 100 kilograms.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.030
Note there are,
again, subtleties even here.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.882
If you think harder,
you can get worried about other

00:35:25.882 --> 00:35:26.854
things.
For example,

00:35:26.854 --> 00:35:30.025
how do I know that when I pull
the spring the first time for

00:35:30.025 --> 00:35:32.387
the mass,
it exerted the same force when

00:35:32.387 --> 00:35:35.480
I pulled the spring the second
time for the elephant?

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.820
After all, springs wear out.
That's why you change your

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.436
shock absorbers in your car.
After a while,

00:35:40.436 --> 00:35:43.567
they don't do the same thing.
First, we got to make sure the

00:35:43.567 --> 00:35:46.150
spring exerts a fixed force
every time.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:48.750
You can say,
"How am I going to check that?

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.400
I don't have the definition of
force yet."

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.859
But we do know the following.
If I pull the one kilogram mass

00:35:53.859 --> 00:35:56.042
and I let it go,
it does something,

00:35:56.042 --> 00:35:58.637
some acceleration.
Then, I pull it again by the

00:35:58.637 --> 00:36:00.929
same amount and let it go;
I do it 10 times.

00:36:00.929 --> 00:36:03.453
If every time I get the same
acceleration,

00:36:03.453 --> 00:36:06.776
I'm convinced this is a
reliable spring that is somehow

00:36:06.776 --> 00:36:10.099
producing the same force under
the same condition.

00:36:10.099 --> 00:36:11.940
On the eleventh time,
I pull the mass.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.138
I will put the elephant in.
With some degree of confidence,

00:36:15.138 --> 00:36:17.489
I'm working with a reliable
spring and then I will get the

00:36:17.489 --> 00:36:20.710
mass of the elephant.
Why is it so important?

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:24.033
It's important for you guys to
know that everything you write

00:36:24.033 --> 00:36:26.692
down in the notebook or
blackboard as a symbol is

00:36:26.692 --> 00:36:30.241
actually a measured quantity.
You should know at all times

00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:32.993
how you measure anything.
If you don't know how to

00:36:32.993 --> 00:36:35.011
measure anything,
you are doing algebra and

00:36:35.011 --> 00:36:37.289
trigonometry.
You are not doing physics.

00:36:37.289 --> 00:36:40.911
This also tells you that the
mass of an object has nothing to

00:36:40.911 --> 00:36:44.556
do with gravitation.
Mass of an object is how much

00:36:44.556 --> 00:36:48.309
it hates to accelerate in
response to a force.

00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:50.869
Newton tells you forces cause
acceleration.

00:36:50.869 --> 00:36:54.670
But the acceleration is not the
same on different objects.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.900
Certain objects resist it more
than others.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.099
They are said to have a bigger
mass.

00:36:59.099 --> 00:37:02.474
We can be precise about how
much bigger by saying,

00:37:02.474 --> 00:37:06.536
"If the acceleration of a body
to a given force is ten times

00:37:06.536 --> 00:37:10.706
that of a one kilogram mass,
then this mass is one-tenth of

00:37:10.706 --> 00:37:14.268
one kilogram."
This is how masses can be

00:37:14.268 --> 00:37:18.711
tabulated using a spring.
Imagine then from now on,

00:37:18.711 --> 00:37:21.739
we can find the mass of any
object, right?

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:24.502
We know now with the same
spring, by this comparison,

00:37:24.502 --> 00:37:27.779
we will find.
All objects now can be

00:37:27.779 --> 00:37:30.879
attributed a mass.
Then we may,

00:37:30.879 --> 00:37:34.715
from this equation,
say a certain force is acting

00:37:34.715 --> 00:37:38.951
in a given situation by
multiplying the m times

00:37:38.951 --> 00:37:43.539
the a.
Then, here is what we actually

00:37:43.539 --> 00:37:46.179
do.
Now, we go back to the spring.

00:37:46.179 --> 00:37:50.503
We go back to the spring and we
want to learn something about

00:37:50.503 --> 00:37:53.093
the spring.
We want to know how much force

00:37:53.093 --> 00:37:55.630
it exerts when I pull it by a
certain amount.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:58.887
Now I can measure that,
because I pull it by one

00:37:58.887 --> 00:38:02.490
centimeter and I find the
acceleration it exerts on a

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:04.851
known mass.
That m times a is

00:38:04.851 --> 00:38:06.300
the force the spring is
exerting.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.510
Then I pull it by 1.1 cm,
and I find ma.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:14.010
I find 1.2, I find ma.
I draw a graph here of the

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:18.949
amount by which I pull the
spring versus the force it

00:38:18.949 --> 00:38:22.238
exerts.
It will typically look like

00:38:22.238 --> 00:38:26.136
this and the formula we say is
F = -kx,

00:38:26.136 --> 00:38:30.380
where k is called "the
force constant."

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.989
You got to understand what the
minus sign is doing here.

00:38:40.989 --> 00:38:46.489
This is the force exerted by
the spring on the mass.

00:38:46.489 --> 00:38:49.319
It says, if you pull it to the
right, so that x is

00:38:49.319 --> 00:38:52.502
positive, the spring will exert
a force which is in the negative

00:38:52.502 --> 00:38:54.789
direction;
that's why you have a minus

00:38:54.789 --> 00:38:57.498
sign.
Then, all springs will do

00:38:57.498 --> 00:39:00.696
something like this.
Further out they can do various

00:39:00.696 --> 00:39:02.351
things.
The force may taper off,

00:39:02.351 --> 00:39:04.867
the force may not be given by a
straight line,

00:39:04.867 --> 00:39:08.199
but for modest deformations,
every spring will have a linear

00:39:08.199 --> 00:39:11.087
regime in which the force is
linearly proportional to the

00:39:11.087 --> 00:39:13.531
stretching.
It also tells you that if you

00:39:13.531 --> 00:39:16.440
compress the spring,
compress it means x is

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.289
now--x is measured from
this position,

00:39:19.289 --> 00:39:23.650
where the spring is neither
compressed nor expanded.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.860
So x is not really the
coordinate of the end point.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.710
You've got to understand that.
Springs have a natural length;

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.630
x is measured from that
length.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.849
If it's positive,
it means you've stretched it,

00:39:33.849 --> 00:39:35.780
if it's negative,
it means compressed.

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.615
This equation is telling you if
you compress it,

00:39:38.615 --> 00:39:42.357
namely if x is negative,
F will be then positive,

00:39:42.357 --> 00:39:44.650
because it's pushing you
outwards.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.026
Therefore, what we have done
now is, we can take all kinds of

00:39:48.026 --> 00:39:51.345
springs and we can calibrate the
force they will exert under

00:39:51.345 --> 00:39:53.832
various conditions.
Namely, if you pull it by so

00:39:53.832 --> 00:39:55.449
much, that's the force it will
exert.

00:39:55.449 --> 00:39:59.850
I want you to think for a
second about two equations.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:08.017
One equation says F = ma.
Other equation says

00:40:08.017 --> 00:40:10.190
F=-kx.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.990
What's going on?
Is one of them Newton's law?

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:22.242
Then what's the other one?
Maybe F = -kx should be

00:40:22.242 --> 00:40:25.036
called Newton's law?
Why is F = ma called

00:40:25.036 --> 00:40:26.877
Newton's law?
Then, what's the meaning of

00:40:26.877 --> 00:40:27.600
this expression?

00:40:31.809 --> 00:40:35.748
What's the difference between
saying F = -kx and F =

00:40:35.748 --> 00:40:37.845
ma?
They are saying very different

00:40:37.845 --> 00:40:39.659
things.
Yes?

00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:42.538
Student:
F = ma is a universal

00:40:42.538 --> 00:40:43.332
law.
Professor Ramamurti

00:40:43.332 --> 00:40:44.309
Shankar: Right.
Let me repeat.

00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:48.803
F = ma is universally
true, independent of the nature

00:40:48.803 --> 00:40:52.150
of the force acting on a body.
Then?

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:55.267
Student:
F = -kx is only

00:40:55.267 --> 00:40:58.324
describing how the spring is.
Professor Ramamurti

00:40:58.324 --> 00:40:59.860
Shankar: Very good.
That's the whole point.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.170
The cycle of Newtonian dynamics
has two parts.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.854
First one says,
if you knew the force acting on

00:41:06.854 --> 00:41:11.099
any body, without going into
what caused the force,

00:41:11.099 --> 00:41:14.231
then you may set that force
equal the mass times

00:41:14.231 --> 00:41:19.075
acceleration of the body.
We think of force as the cause

00:41:19.075 --> 00:41:23.340
and a as the result or
the effect.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:28.340
Force causes acceleration and
this is a precise statement.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:32.212
There, Newton doesn't tell you
what forces are going to be

00:41:32.212 --> 00:41:34.929
acting on a body in a given
situation.

00:41:34.929 --> 00:41:37.780
If you leave the body alone,
maybe there's no force acting

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.749
on it.
If you connect the body to a

00:41:39.749 --> 00:41:42.440
spring, which is neither
compressed nor extended,

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.491
there's no force acting on it.
If you pull the spring,

00:41:45.491 --> 00:41:48.914
there is a force acting on it.
Newton is not going to come and

00:41:48.914 --> 00:41:52.406
tell you what force the spring
will exert when it's pulled by

00:41:52.406 --> 00:41:54.840
some amount.
That is another part of your

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.151
assignment.
The physicist has to constantly

00:41:58.151 --> 00:42:01.220
find out what forces act on
bodies.

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.201
That's a separate exercise.
In every context in which I

00:42:04.201 --> 00:42:06.656
place a body,
I'll have to know what are the

00:42:06.656 --> 00:42:09.229
forces acting on it.
I've got to find them by

00:42:09.229 --> 00:42:11.379
experimenting,
by putting other bodies and

00:42:11.379 --> 00:42:14.422
seeing how they react and then
finding out what's the force

00:42:14.422 --> 00:42:17.098
that acts on a body when it's
placed in this or that

00:42:17.098 --> 00:42:19.285
situation.
Once you've got that,

00:42:19.285 --> 00:42:21.936
then you come back.
In the case of a spring,

00:42:21.936 --> 00:42:24.179
this is the law that you will
deduce.

00:42:24.179 --> 00:42:26.322
If it's something else,
you will have to deduce another

00:42:26.322 --> 00:42:27.459
law.
For example,

00:42:27.459 --> 00:42:31.582
we know that if a body is near
the surface of the Earth,

00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:35.780
the force of gravity and that
object seems to be m

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:39.050
times g,
where g is 9.8.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.570
That's something you find out
by experiment.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:45.141
Every time you are finding out
a different force that's acting

00:42:45.141 --> 00:42:49.818
on a body with different origin.
One says, leave any body near

00:42:49.818 --> 00:42:53.705
the Earth, it yields a force.
I know this is the right

00:42:53.705 --> 00:42:56.937
answer, because if I now find
the acceleration,

00:42:56.937 --> 00:43:01.151
I find it's mg divided
by m and I get -g

00:43:01.151 --> 00:43:05.403
as the answer for all bodies.
By the way, that's a very

00:43:05.403 --> 00:43:09.131
remarkable property of the
gravitational force--the

00:43:09.131 --> 00:43:11.889
cancellation of the two
ms.

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:16.006
If you look at the electrical
force, the force of electricity,

00:43:16.006 --> 00:43:18.840
on the proton and electron or
something,

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.969
it's not proportional to the
mass of either object.

00:43:20.969 --> 00:43:22.651
It's proportional to the
electric charge of either

00:43:22.651 --> 00:43:24.465
object.
Therefore, when you divide by

00:43:24.465 --> 00:43:26.126
the mass to get the
acceleration,

00:43:26.126 --> 00:43:29.190
the response of different
bodies is inverse to the mass.

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:32.322
But gravity has a remarkable
property that the pull of the

00:43:32.322 --> 00:43:35.619
Earth is itself proportional to
the inertia of the object.

00:43:35.619 --> 00:43:38.439
So, when you divide by
m, m cancels and

00:43:38.439 --> 00:43:41.367
everything falls at the same
rate on the surface of the

00:43:41.367 --> 00:43:43.366
Earth.
In fact, there's a property of

00:43:43.366 --> 00:43:45.889
gravitational fields anywhere,
even in outer space,

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:48.210
but there is some residual
field between all the planets

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:49.730
and all the stars in the
universe,

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:53.102
that the force on a body is
proportional to the mass of the

00:43:53.102 --> 00:43:54.780
body.
So, when you divide by the mass

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.829
to get the acceleration,
you get the same answer.

00:43:56.829 --> 00:43:59.441
Everything -- gold,
silver, diamonds,

00:43:59.441 --> 00:44:03.214
particles -- everything
accelerates the same way in a

00:44:03.214 --> 00:44:07.059
gravitational field,
due to this remarkable fact.

00:44:07.059 --> 00:44:09.920
This was known for a long time,
but it took Mr.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:13.153
Einstein to figure out why
nature is behaving in that

00:44:13.153 --> 00:44:14.690
fashion.
If I have some time,

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.552
I'll tell you later.
But there are two qualities

00:44:17.552 --> 00:44:20.822
which happen to be equal.
One is inertial mass,

00:44:20.822 --> 00:44:23.949
which is how much you hate your
velocity to change,

00:44:23.949 --> 00:44:26.199
how hard you resist
acceleration.

00:44:26.199 --> 00:44:29.869
That exists far from planets,
far from everything.

00:44:29.869 --> 00:44:31.932
Other is gravitational mass,
which is the measure of how

00:44:31.932 --> 00:44:33.320
much you're attracted to the
Earth.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.293
There's no reason why these two
attributes had to be

00:44:36.293 --> 00:44:38.741
proportional,
but they are proportional and

00:44:38.741 --> 00:44:41.889
they are equal by choice of
units and you can ask,

00:44:41.889 --> 00:44:44.760
"Is this just an accident or is
it part of a big picture?"

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.211
It turns out,
it's part of a big picture and

00:44:47.211 --> 00:44:50.119
all of general relativity is
based on this one great

00:44:50.119 --> 00:44:53.140
equivalence of two quantities
which are very different

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.697
attributes.
Why should the amount by which

00:44:55.697 --> 00:44:58.978
you're attracted to the Earth be
also a measure of how much you

00:44:58.978 --> 00:45:01.600
hate acceleration?
Two different features, right?

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.936
But they happen to be the same.
Anyway, what physicists do is

00:45:04.936 --> 00:45:08.420
they put bodies in various
circumstances and they deduce

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.740
various forces.
This is the force of gravity.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:15.554
This is the force of the spring.
Here's another force you might

00:45:15.554 --> 00:45:18.219
find.
You put a chunk of wood on a

00:45:18.219 --> 00:45:22.179
table and you try to move it at
constant speed.

00:45:22.179 --> 00:45:25.019
Then you find that you have to
apply minimum force.

00:45:25.019 --> 00:45:27.460
We are moving at constant
velocity.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:30.190
That means the force you're
applying is cancelled by another

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.550
force, which has got to be the
force of friction.

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.970
So force of friction is yet
another force.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.539
Then, there are other forces.
You guys know there is the

00:45:41.539 --> 00:45:43.889
electrical force.
If you bring a plus charge near

00:45:43.889 --> 00:45:45.655
a plus charge,
if my body m,

00:45:45.655 --> 00:45:48.460
has a plus charge and another
plus charge is there,

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:52.119
it'll feel a force due to that.
That's not going to be given by

00:45:52.119 --> 00:45:54.032
Newton.
So, Newton did not ever tell

00:45:54.032 --> 00:45:57.050
you what the expression for
force is in a given context.

00:45:57.050 --> 00:46:00.157
That is a constant study.
Coulomb discovered the

00:46:00.157 --> 00:46:02.251
Coulomb's law,
which is a repulsion between

00:46:02.251 --> 00:46:04.439
charges.
Nowadays we know if you go into

00:46:04.439 --> 00:46:06.820
the neutron or the proton,
there are quarks.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.670
There are forces between the
quarks.

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:11.765
You can ask what the force that
this quark will exert and that

00:46:11.765 --> 00:46:15.162
quark at a certain separation.
That was obviously not known to

00:46:15.162 --> 00:46:17.851
Newton.
Remember, Newton said F =

00:46:17.851 --> 00:46:22.713
ma, but didn't tell you what
value F has in a given

00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:25.136
context.
He just said whenever there's

00:46:25.136 --> 00:46:27.483
an acceleration,
it's going to be due to some

00:46:27.483 --> 00:46:30.469
forces and it's your job to find
what the forces are.

00:46:30.469 --> 00:46:32.458
To find the force,
what you will do is,

00:46:32.458 --> 00:46:35.179
suppose somebody says,
"Hey, I've got a new force.

00:46:35.179 --> 00:46:38.760
Every time I go near the
podium, I find I'm drawn to it."

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.389
Okay, that's a new force.
The word gets around and we

00:46:41.389 --> 00:46:44.000
want to measure the force.
What do I do?

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.760
I stand near this podium.
I'm drawn to it.

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.320
I cannot stop.
I tie a spring to my back and I

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.538
anchor it to the wall and see
how much the spring stretches

00:46:52.538 --> 00:46:56.004
before the two forces balance.
Then I know that kx is

00:46:56.004 --> 00:46:59.159
equal to the force this is
exerting at this separation.

00:46:59.159 --> 00:47:02.206
I move a little closer and I
find the stretching is a

00:47:02.206 --> 00:47:04.446
different number.
Maybe the force is getting

00:47:04.446 --> 00:47:06.811
stronger.
That's how by either balancing

00:47:06.811 --> 00:47:10.803
the unknown force with a known
force or by simply measuring the

00:47:10.803 --> 00:47:14.666
acceleration as I fall towards
this podium and multiplying by

00:47:14.666 --> 00:47:16.732
mass,
you can find the force that

00:47:16.732 --> 00:47:20.310
exerts on me.
It's not a cyclical and useless

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.801
definition.
It's a very interesting

00:47:22.801 --> 00:47:26.250
interplay and that's the
foundation of all of mechanics.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:29.416
We are constantly looking for
values of F and we're

00:47:29.416 --> 00:47:32.860
constantly looking for responses
or bodies to a known force.

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:36.570
Here's a simple example of a
complete Newtonian problem.

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:41.825
A mass is attached to a spring.
It is pulled by a certain

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:46.050
amount x,
and is released.

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:48.889
What is it going to do?
We go to Newton.

00:47:48.889 --> 00:47:52.884
Newton says F = ma,
so to make it a useful result

00:47:52.884 --> 00:47:56.369
of this problem,
we know the mass of this guy.

00:47:56.369 --> 00:47:58.949
We did the comparison with the
elephant or something;

00:47:58.949 --> 00:48:02.780
a is the second
derivative of x and for

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.579
this problem,
when F is due to a

00:48:05.579 --> 00:48:08.030
spring,
we know the force is that by

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:10.678
studying the spring.
Suddenly, you have a

00:48:10.678 --> 00:48:15.006
mathematically complete problem.
Mathematically complete problem

00:48:15.006 --> 00:48:18.467
is that you can find the
function x(t) by saying

00:48:18.467 --> 00:48:21.863
that the second derivative of
the function is equal to

00:48:21.863 --> 00:48:24.940
-k over m times
the function.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:26.713
Then, you go to the Math
Department and say,

00:48:26.713 --> 00:48:28.940
"Please tell me what's the
answer to this equation?"

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.402
We don't have to worry about
how you solve it,

00:48:31.402 --> 00:48:34.139
but it's problem in mathematics
and the answer will

00:48:34.139 --> 00:48:36.760
be--surprise,
it's going to be oscillating

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.719
back and forth and that'll come
out of the wash.

00:48:39.719 --> 00:48:42.320
This is how you formulate
problems.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.050
You can formulate another
problem.

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:47.057
Later on, we know about gravity.
Newton finds out there's a

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:48.810
force of gravity acting on
everything.

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:52.010
Here's the Sun.
Here's your planet.

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:54.536
At this instant,
the planet may be moving at

00:48:54.536 --> 00:48:57.343
that speed.
Then the acceleration of the

00:48:57.343 --> 00:49:01.940
planet is the force of gravity
between the planet and the Sun,

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.000
which Newton will tell you is
directed towards the Sun and it

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.170
depends on how far you are.
Depending on how far the planet

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.168
is from the Sun and where it's
located, you will get the

00:49:11.168 --> 00:49:13.110
left-hand side.
That's another law.

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:14.969
That's the Law of Universal
Gravitation.

00:49:14.969 --> 00:49:18.687
Then again, you will find the
evolution of the planetary

00:49:18.687 --> 00:49:22.202
motion, because the rate of
change of the position is

00:49:22.202 --> 00:49:25.444
connected to the position.
Again, go to the math guys and

00:49:25.444 --> 00:49:26.820
say, "What's the answer to
that?"

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.486
and they tell you the answer,
which will be some elliptical

00:49:29.486 --> 00:49:33.280
motion.
Okay.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.771
By the way, Mr.
Newton did not have math guys

00:49:36.771 --> 00:49:40.114
he could go to.
Not only did he formulate laws

00:49:40.114 --> 00:49:43.039
of gravitation,
he also invented calculus and

00:49:43.039 --> 00:49:46.829
he also learned how to solve the
differential equation for

00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:49.340
calculus.
He probably felt that nobody

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:52.558
around was doing any work,
because all the thing was given

00:49:52.558 --> 00:49:55.290
to this one person.
It's really amazing that what

00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:57.757
Newton did in the case of
gravity was to find the

00:49:57.757 --> 00:50:01.297
expression for this.
A few years earlier he had also

00:50:01.297 --> 00:50:04.015
gotten this law.
By putting the two together,

00:50:04.015 --> 00:50:06.460
out comes the elliptical motion
of the planets.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:10.343
We'll come back to that,
but you have to understand the

00:50:10.343 --> 00:50:12.860
structure of Newtonian
mechanics.

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:17.050
Generally, any mechanics will
require knowledge of the force.

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:19.989
Now, I'm going to add one more
amendment.

00:50:19.989 --> 00:50:21.973
You don't have to write in your
notebook, but you've got to

00:50:21.973 --> 00:50:23.691
remember.
Maybe you'll but a little

00:50:23.691 --> 00:50:27.070
T and circle it.
Let me write it here.

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:30.289
F_T means the
total force on a body.

00:50:30.289 --> 00:50:33.570
You've got many forces acting
on a body.

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:36.650
The acceleration is controlled
by the sum.

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:40.076
If I'm now working in one
dimension, it's obvious because

00:50:40.076 --> 00:50:43.274
I'm not using any vectors.
Then, you may have forces to

00:50:43.274 --> 00:50:45.820
the right, forces to the left
pushing, pulling.

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:47.382
You add them all up
algebraically,

00:50:47.382 --> 00:50:50.130
keeping track of their sign,
and that's the total force.

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:53.429
That's connected to mass times
acceleration.

00:50:53.429 --> 00:50:56.000
Now, I'll give you the third
law.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.270
The third law says that if
there are two bodies,

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:04.541
called one and two,
force of one on two is minus

00:51:04.541 --> 00:51:08.630
the force of the second on the
first one.

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:10.820
This is the thing about action
and reaction.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:17.179
All the laws that anybody knows
have this property.

00:51:17.179 --> 00:51:21.627
What does it require to be a
successful mechanic,

00:51:21.627 --> 00:51:24.869
to do all the mechanics
problems?

00:51:24.869 --> 00:51:28.096
You got to be good at writing
down the forces acting on a

00:51:28.096 --> 00:51:29.808
body.
That's what it's all going to

00:51:29.808 --> 00:51:33.110
boil down to.
Here is my advice to you.

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:39.554
Do not forget the existing
forces and do not make up your

00:51:39.554 --> 00:51:42.760
own forces.
I've seen both happen.

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:46.509
Right now at this point in our
course, whenever you have a

00:51:46.509 --> 00:51:49.929
problem where there is some body
and someone says,

00:51:49.929 --> 00:51:53.307
"Write all the forces on it",
what you have to do is very

00:51:53.307 --> 00:51:54.782
simple.
Every force,

00:51:54.782 --> 00:51:58.513
with one exception,
can be seen as a force due to

00:51:58.513 --> 00:52:02.143
direct contact with the body.
Either a rope is pulling,

00:52:02.143 --> 00:52:03.973
a rope is pushing it,
you are pushing it,

00:52:03.973 --> 00:52:06.840
you are pulling it.
That's a contact on the body.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:10.502
If nothing is touching the
body, there are no forces on it,

00:52:10.502 --> 00:52:13.659
with one exception which is,
of course, gravity.

00:52:13.659 --> 00:52:17.819
Gravity is one force that acts
on a body without the source of

00:52:17.819 --> 00:52:21.070
the force actually touching it.
That's it.

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:25.250
Do not draw any more forces.
People do draw other forces.

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:27.855
When a body is going around a
circle, they say that's some

00:52:27.855 --> 00:52:30.550
centrifugal force acting.
There is no such thing.

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:33.673
Be careful.
Whenever there is a force,

00:52:33.673 --> 00:52:37.260
it can be traced back to a
tangible material cause,

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:42.053
which is all the time a force
of contact, with the exception

00:52:42.053 --> 00:52:44.817
of gravity.
Okay, so with that,

00:52:44.817 --> 00:52:49.670
if you write the right forces,
you will be just fine.

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:52.026
You will be able to solve all
the problems we have in

00:52:52.026 --> 00:52:54.457
mechanics.
I'm going to now start doing

00:52:54.457 --> 00:52:58.219
simple problems in mechanics.
They will start out simple and,

00:52:58.219 --> 00:53:01.250
as usual, they will get
progressively more difficult.

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:13.360
Let's start with our first
triumph will be motion in 1D.

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:18.710
Here is some object,
it's 5 kilograms and I apply 10

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.484
Newtons.
Someone says,

00:53:20.484 --> 00:53:25.800
"What's the acceleration?"
Everyone knows it is 10 over 5

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:29.572
equals 2.
Now we know how we got all the

00:53:29.572 --> 00:53:32.909
numbers that go into the very
question.

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:34.909
How do we know 10 Newtons is
acting?

00:53:34.909 --> 00:53:37.550
I think you people know how we
can say that with confidence.

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:40.280
How do we know the mass of this
is 5 kilograms?

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:43.340
We know how you got that from
an earlier experiment.

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.030
Now, we know how the numbers
come in.

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:47.650
The algebra is,
of course, very trivial here.

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:51.820
Then, the next problem is a
little more interesting.

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:57.984
Here I got 3 kg and I got 2 kg
and I'm pushing with 10 Newtons

00:53:57.984 --> 00:54:01.420
and I want to know what happens.

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:08.937
One way is to just use your
common sense and realize that if

00:54:08.937 --> 00:54:11.579
you push it this way,
these two guys are going to

00:54:11.579 --> 00:54:14.836
move together.
And know intuitively that if

00:54:14.836 --> 00:54:18.883
they move together,
they will behave like an object

00:54:18.883 --> 00:54:22.929
of mass 5 and the acceleration
will again be 2.

00:54:22.929 --> 00:54:26.545
But there's another way to do
this and I'm going to give you

00:54:26.545 --> 00:54:30.100
now the simplest example of the
other way, which is to draw

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.546
free-body diagrams.
By the way, when I say there's

00:54:33.546 --> 00:54:36.328
10 Newtons acting this way,
you might say,

00:54:36.328 --> 00:54:39.019
"What about gravity?
What about the table?"

00:54:39.019 --> 00:54:41.951
Imagine that this is in outer
space where there is no gravity

00:54:41.951 --> 00:54:44.478
for now.
The motion is just along the

00:54:44.478 --> 00:54:48.057
x axis.
The free-body diagram,

00:54:48.057 --> 00:54:54.389
it says you can pick any one
body that you like and apply

00:54:54.389 --> 00:54:59.630
F = ma to it,
provided you identify all the

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:06.853
forces acting on that body.
We'll first pick the body,

00:55:06.853 --> 00:55:11.400
with mass 3.
Here's the body of mass 3.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.849
What are the forces on it?
This is certainly acting on it.

00:55:15.849 --> 00:55:18.880
Then, you have to ask,
"What other force is acting?"

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:25.884
Here is where you have to think.
Anybody want to guess from the

00:55:25.884 --> 00:55:28.050
last row what force?
Yes?

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:30.690
Student:
The reactive force of 2 on 3?

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:31.390
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:36.402
So let's give it a name.
Let's point it that way and

00:55:36.402 --> 00:55:43.500
call it F2 on 3.
That's the end of this guy.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:47.476
Let's look at the other fellow.
Maybe you should complete the

00:55:47.476 --> 00:55:53.100
force acting on this one.
Can you tell me what it is?

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:57.954
Same person in the last row.
Student:

00:55:57.954 --> 00:55:59.922
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:55:59.922 --> 00:56:02.070
Shankar: And how big is
that?

00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:06.112
Student:
The same as F2,

00:56:06.112 --> 00:56:07.147
3.
Professor Ramamurti

00:56:07.147 --> 00:56:09.013
Shankar: Right.
I don't want to give it too

00:56:09.013 --> 00:56:10.924
many different names,
because F2,

00:56:10.924 --> 00:56:13.130
3 and F3,
2 are equal and opposite.

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:15.679
I'm already showing F2,
3 acting to the left.

00:56:15.679 --> 00:56:18.090
Let me give it some other name
like f.

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:22.402
Then you agree this will be the
same f but pointing that

00:56:22.402 --> 00:56:26.489
way.
Here is the mistake some people

00:56:26.489 --> 00:56:29.170
make.
They add to that the 10 Newtons.

00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:32.788
It's the 10 Newtons acting on
it, because I know the 10 Newton

00:56:32.788 --> 00:56:36.230
is pushing me and I'm going to
feel it even if I'm here.

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:39.540
That will be a mistake.
That's an example of adding a

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.809
force that you really shouldn't
be adding.

00:56:41.809 --> 00:56:45.489
The only force acting on this
guy is this little f.

00:56:45.489 --> 00:56:48.060
That's, in turn,
because this guy's being pushed

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:50.739
by the 10 Newtons,
but that's not your problem.

00:56:50.739 --> 00:56:54.398
Your problem is to only look at
the forces of contact on you,

00:56:54.398 --> 00:56:59.699
and that is just this f.
Then we do F = ma for

00:56:59.699 --> 00:57:02.767
these two guys.
For this guy,

00:57:02.767 --> 00:57:08.340
F = ma will be 10 minus
f is 3 times a.

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:13.369
The other one,
it'll be f = 2a.

00:57:13.369 --> 00:57:15.849
Notice I'm using the same
acceleration for both.

00:57:15.849 --> 00:57:19.385
I know that if the second mass
moved faster than the first one,

00:57:19.385 --> 00:57:21.610
then the picture is completely
wrong.

00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:24.486
If it moved slower than the
first one, it means it's rammed

00:57:24.486 --> 00:57:26.576
into this one.
That also cannot happen,

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:29.059
so they're moving with the same
acceleration.

00:57:29.059 --> 00:57:30.800
There's only one unknown
a.

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.710
Once you got this,
you realize what you got to do.

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:39.559
This equation is begging you to
be added to this equation.

00:57:39.559 --> 00:57:41.116
You got a plus f and a
minus f,

00:57:41.116 --> 00:57:42.460
so you got to do what you got
to do.

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:45.849
You add the two,
you get 10 = 5a and you

00:57:45.849 --> 00:57:49.823
get a = 2.
Once you got a = 2,

00:57:49.823 --> 00:57:54.771
you can go back and realize
here that f = 4,

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:59.349
so you got really 4 Newtons.
Now, we know the full story.

00:57:59.349 --> 00:58:03.449
4 Newtons acting on 2 kg,
gives you an acceleration of 2.

00:58:03.449 --> 00:58:08.121
On this guy,
I have 10 from the left and I

00:58:08.121 --> 00:58:13.590
have 4--10 acting this way,
4 acting that way.

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:20.350
That is 6 Newtons divided by 3
kg is also an acceleration of 2.

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:23.852
This is a simpler example.
A simple example of free body

00:58:23.852 --> 00:58:25.920
diagrams.
Very simple.

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.219
If you can do this,
you can do most of the problems

00:58:28.219 --> 00:58:33.471
you will run into.
Just don't add stuff that's not

00:58:33.471 --> 00:58:35.187
there.
That's all you have to be

00:58:35.187 --> 00:58:37.143
careful about.
The stuff that people tend to

00:58:37.143 --> 00:58:40.432
add sometimes is to keep drawing
the 10 Newtons that's acting on

00:58:40.432 --> 00:58:40.850
that.

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:49.450
Now, here's another variation.
The variation looks like this.

00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:56.662
I got 3 kg and I have a rope.
I got 2 kg and I pull this guy

00:58:56.662 --> 00:58:58.200
with 10 Newtons.

00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:06.068
What's going to happen?
Again, your common sense tells

00:59:06.068 --> 00:59:08.820
you, "Look, you are pulling
something whose effective mass

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.510
seems to be 5,
the answer is 2."

00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:14.909
Let's get that systematically
by using free-body diagrams.

00:59:14.909 --> 00:59:17.679
Now, there are really three
bodies here.

00:59:17.679 --> 00:59:20.929
Block one and block two and the
rope connecting them.

00:59:20.929 --> 00:59:27.690
In all these examples,
this rope is assumed to be

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:30.584
massless.
We know there is no thing

00:59:30.584 --> 00:59:33.380
called a massless rope,
but most ropes have a mass,

00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:36.191
but maybe negligible compared
to the two blocks you are

00:59:36.191 --> 00:59:39.106
pulling, so we'll take the
idealized limit where the mass

00:59:39.106 --> 00:59:44.500
of the rope is 0.
Here is the deal.

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:48.304
3 kg is being pulled by the
rope on the right with a force

00:59:48.304 --> 00:59:52.310
that I'm going to call T,
which stands for tension.

00:59:55.449 --> 01:00:00.268
The rope is being pulled
backwards by this guy,

01:00:00.268 --> 01:00:04.173
the T.
What is the force on the other

01:00:04.173 --> 01:00:06.280
side?
What should that be?

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:12.914
Who said T?
Why is it definitely T

01:00:12.914 --> 01:00:15.128
and not something else?
What would happen if it's

01:00:15.128 --> 01:00:17.297
something else?
Student:

01:00:17.297 --> 01:00:21.849
If it was greater,
then the rope would snap.

01:00:21.849 --> 01:00:23.851
Well, if it was greater
[inaudible]

01:00:23.851 --> 01:00:26.736
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: It won't snap,

01:00:26.736 --> 01:00:29.150
but something else will be a
problem.

01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:30.473
Yes?
Student:

01:00:30.473 --> 01:00:31.755
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:00:31.755 --> 01:00:33.660
Shankar: Not only faster,
but what will be its

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:37.612
acceleration?
If the two forces don't cancel,

01:00:37.612 --> 01:00:41.608
you have a net force.
What are you going to divide by

01:00:41.608 --> 01:00:43.562
to get the acceleration?
Student:

01:00:43.562 --> 01:00:44.864
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:00:44.864 --> 01:00:45.969
Shankar: Zero,
right?

01:00:45.969 --> 01:00:48.392
So, a massless body cannot have
a net force on it,

01:00:48.392 --> 01:00:51.260
because the acceleration of the
rope cannot be infinite.

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.972
In fact, it has to be some
finite number,

01:00:52.972 --> 01:00:55.369
which is the acceleration of
either of these two guys.

01:00:55.369 --> 01:00:59.316
So, massless bodies will always
have, like a massless rope,

01:00:59.316 --> 01:01:02.309
equal and opposite forces on
the two ends.

01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:05.349
That is called the tension on
the rope.

01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:08.598
When you say the rope is under
tension being pulled from both

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:11.539
sides by a certain force,
the tension is not 0 just

01:01:11.539 --> 01:01:14.380
because this T and that
T cancel.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:19.230
It's true the net force is 0,
but it doesn't mean you can

01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:22.391
ignore it.
Suppose you are being pulled by

01:01:22.391 --> 01:01:26.293
my favorite animals -- the
elephants -- from both sides by

01:01:26.293 --> 01:01:28.840
equal force.
You don't find any consolation

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.020
in the fact that these forces
add up to 0.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:34.885
You feel the pain.
That pain is what--This

01:01:34.885 --> 01:01:39.010
gentleman doesn't agree.
One of you guys nodding your

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:40.260
head.
Do you feel the pain?

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.310
Do you agree?
Okay.

01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:46.179
That force is called a tension.
Whenever you're asked on a

01:01:46.179 --> 01:01:48.559
problem, "What's the tension on
the rope?"

01:01:48.559 --> 01:01:52.283
you're looking for that equal
and opposite forces acting at

01:01:52.283 --> 01:01:55.159
two ends of the rope.
We don't know what it is.

01:01:55.159 --> 01:01:58.205
We'll give it a name,
but by linking that T to

01:01:58.205 --> 01:02:00.840
that T,
we can also figure out the same

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.530
T must be exerted on this
one by Newton's third law,

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:07.719
because if this block is the
only one that could be pulling

01:02:07.719 --> 01:02:10.519
this rope with T.
Therefore, the ropes will be

01:02:10.519 --> 01:02:13.162
pulling the block with T
in the other direction,

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:17.370
then I got 10 Newtons here.
Now, you can do F = ma

01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:21.919
for the three different objects.
There's nothing to do here,

01:02:21.919 --> 01:02:24.090
because the forces are 0,
the mass is 0.

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:27.104
It doesn't tell you anything.
The first one tells you

01:02:27.104 --> 01:02:32.908
T = 3a.
The other one tells you 10 -

01:02:32.908 --> 01:02:40.030
T = 2a.
Again, we know what to do.

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:43.080
We add these numbers and we get
10 = 5a.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:47.725
Therefore, we find a = 2.
Once you find a = 2,

01:02:47.725 --> 01:02:52.661
you find T = 6.
So, tension on the rope is 6

01:02:52.661 --> 01:02:55.017
Newtons.
This is very important,

01:02:55.017 --> 01:02:58.193
because when you buy a rope,
they will tell you how much

01:02:58.193 --> 01:03:00.559
tension it can take before it'll
snap.

01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:04.411
If your plan is to accelerate a
3 kg mass with an acceleration

01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:07.657
of 2 meters per second,
you better have a rope that can

01:03:07.657 --> 01:03:10.940
furnish that force and it can
take the tension of 6 Newtons.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:22.250
Now, for the- whoa!

01:03:38.199 --> 01:03:41.925
I'm going to give the last
class a problem which is pretty

01:03:41.925 --> 01:03:45.650
interesting, which is what
happens to you when you have an

01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:50.619
elevator.
Here is a weighing machine and

01:03:50.619 --> 01:03:55.699
that's you standing on the
elevator.

01:03:55.699 --> 01:03:58.787
We're going to ask,
"What's the needle showing at

01:03:58.787 --> 01:04:01.897
different times?"
First, take the case in the

01:04:01.897 --> 01:04:06.231
elevator is on the ground floor
of some building and completely

01:04:06.231 --> 01:04:12.019
addressed.
Then, let's look at the spring.

01:04:12.019 --> 01:04:15.754
The spring is getting squashed
because you are pushing down and

01:04:15.754 --> 01:04:18.748
the floor is pushing up.
You are pushing down with the

01:04:18.748 --> 01:04:20.915
weight mg,
and the floor has got to be

01:04:20.915 --> 01:04:23.920
pushing up with the md,
because the spring is not going

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.709
anywhere.
So the spring is being pushed

01:04:27.709 --> 01:04:31.769
by mg here and mg
here.

01:04:31.769 --> 01:04:35.043
Therefore, it'll compress by an
unknown x,

01:04:35.043 --> 01:04:39.067
which is equal to mg
divided by the force constant of

01:04:39.067 --> 01:04:42.054
the spring.
By the way, that is a subtle

01:04:42.054 --> 01:04:44.579
thing people may not have
realized.

01:04:44.579 --> 01:04:48.647
Even in the case of this
spring, when you pull it,

01:04:48.647 --> 01:04:52.300
if you pull it to the right by
some force.

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.059
Remember, the wall is pulling
to the left with the same force.

01:04:55.059 --> 01:04:58.349
So springs are always pushed or
pulled on either side with the

01:04:58.349 --> 01:05:00.412
same force.
We focus on one because we are

01:05:00.412 --> 01:05:02.184
paying for it,
but the wall is doing the

01:05:02.184 --> 01:05:04.237
opposite.
We don't pay any attention to

01:05:04.237 --> 01:05:06.020
that.
You cannot have a spring pulled

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:08.011
only at one side,
because then it will then

01:05:08.011 --> 01:05:10.809
accelerate with infinite
acceleration in that direction.

01:05:10.809 --> 01:05:13.570
This spring is getting squashed
on either side,

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:16.329
and it'll squash by certain
amount x,

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:18.699
that depends on your mass,
and that x will be

01:05:18.699 --> 01:05:21.579
turned into a motion of a needle
and that'll read your mass.

01:05:21.579 --> 01:05:25.951
Now, what happens if the
elevator is accelerating upwards

01:05:25.951 --> 01:05:30.239
with an acceleration a?
That's the question.

01:05:30.239 --> 01:05:35.669
The way I analyze it is,
I say, if I look at me and I

01:05:35.669 --> 01:05:40.571
write the forces on me,
that is mg acting down,

01:05:40.571 --> 01:05:44.850
then we use w as the
symbol to represent the force

01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:50.466
exerted by the spring;
w - mg =

01:05:50.466 --> 01:05:54.000
ma.
That is, F = ma.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.111
When I was not accelerating and
everything was at rest,

01:05:58.111 --> 01:06:01.081
ma was 0,
w was mg,

01:06:01.081 --> 01:06:04.659
and w was the reading on
the needle.

01:06:04.659 --> 01:06:08.622
But if I'm accelerating,
the force exerted by the spring

01:06:08.622 --> 01:06:11.865
and therefore,
the needle the weighing machine

01:06:11.865 --> 01:06:15.539
reads is m times g
plus a.

01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:17.849
It means, when you are
accelerating upwards,

01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:21.126
as the elevator picks up speed,
the reading on the spring will

01:06:21.126 --> 01:06:24.512
be more and you will feel heavy.
You feel heavy and it reads

01:06:24.512 --> 01:06:27.739
more because the poor spring not
only has to support you from

01:06:27.739 --> 01:06:31.144
falling through the floor,
but also accelerate you counter

01:06:31.144 --> 01:06:34.264
to what gravity wants to do.
That's why it is g plus

01:06:34.264 --> 01:06:36.346
a.
So, you picked up some speed,

01:06:36.346 --> 01:06:38.909
then you're coasting along at a
steady speed.

01:06:38.909 --> 01:06:42.250
Then, a drops out and
you weigh your normal self.

01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:46.040
As you come to the top of the
building, the elevator has to

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:50.091
decelerate, so that it loses its
positive velocity and comes to

01:06:50.091 --> 01:06:52.240
rest.
So a will be negative

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.415
and w,
in fact, will be less than

01:06:54.415 --> 01:06:56.566
mg.
So, you will feel weightless

01:06:56.566 --> 01:06:59.369
for a short time or you'll feel
your weight is little.

01:06:59.369 --> 01:07:03.351
Then, you come to rest and the
opposite happens on the way

01:07:03.351 --> 01:07:05.553
down.
Let me just briefly look at the

01:07:05.553 --> 01:07:08.511
ride on the way down.
As you start on the top and go

01:07:08.511 --> 01:07:10.659
down, your acceleration is
negative.

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:12.745
Remember, you've got to keep
track of the sign of

01:07:12.745 --> 01:07:14.570
acceleration,
so if you're picking up speed

01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:16.470
towards the ground,
a is negative,

01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:18.785
so it will be g plus
a, but a is a

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:21.336
negative number.
Let me write it as g

01:07:21.336 --> 01:07:23.780
minus the absolute value of
a.

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:27.933
You can see that if a
was equal to g,

01:07:27.933 --> 01:07:31.920
your downward acceleration is
that of gravity,

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.217
namely the cable has snapped in
the elevator,

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:37.937
then you don't feel any weight.
You don't feel any weight

01:07:37.937 --> 01:07:42.332
because your weight is the
opposition you get to falling

01:07:42.332 --> 01:07:45.488
through the floor;
but if the floor is giving way

01:07:45.488 --> 01:07:48.099
and you're just falling freely,
you feel weightless.

01:07:48.099 --> 01:07:51.678
It's wrong to think that you
feel weightless because you

01:07:51.678 --> 01:07:54.923
escaped the pull of gravity.
We all know that in a falling

01:07:54.923 --> 01:07:57.599
elevator, you definitely do not
escape the pull of gravity.

01:07:57.599 --> 01:07:59.980
It's going to catch up with you
in a few seconds.

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:03.041
Likewise, when in outer space,
when you are orbiting the

01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:06.046
Earth, people are always
floating around in these space

01:08:06.046 --> 01:08:08.110
stations.
They have not escaped the pull

01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:11.005
of gravity either.
They have just stopped fighting

01:08:11.005 --> 01:08:12.407
it.
If you escape the pull of

01:08:12.407 --> 01:08:15.000
gravity, your spaceship will be
off, won't be orbiting the

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.498
Earth.
Anyway, I will return to this

01:08:18.498 --> 01:08:21.170
next time.
Do your problems.

01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:24.529
There's quite a few problems.
You should start them right

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:25.529
away.

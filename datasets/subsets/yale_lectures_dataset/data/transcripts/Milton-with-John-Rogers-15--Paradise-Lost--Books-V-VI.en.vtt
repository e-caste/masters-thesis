00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.666
Professor John
Rogers: In Book Four of

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.219
Paradise Lost,
Milton had sketched the origins

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:09.920
of human freedom.
You remember this.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.635
Eve's first memory,
or her reflection on her

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:18.215
reflection in the pool,
had established the importance

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:22.795
of freedom and also the
importance of independence for

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:27.894
not only her relation with Adam
but essentially all of human

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:30.900
relations.
Milton's concern in Book Four

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.000
was to establish something like
the viability of a freedom that

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.557
was able,
in some way,

00:00:35.557 --> 00:00:39.705
to coexist with what we
discussed as the hierarchical

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:44.211
set of power relations.
This coexistence of freedom,

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.425
on the one hand,
and social hierarchy,

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:50.898
on the other,
is something that this poem

00:00:50.898 --> 00:00:54.221
continues to assert.
I would also add that it's

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.480
something that this poem
continues to worry about.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.076
It's an extraordinarily
problematic but crucial element

00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:06.431
of Paradise Lost.
Now, I want to review a couple

00:01:06.431 --> 00:01:11.386
of moments in Book Four.
Think back to what Eve had told

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:14.402
Adam after she had been
compelled by him,

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:18.446
and also by the warning voice,
after she had been compelled to

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:20.807
channel all of her erotic
energies away from the

00:01:20.807 --> 00:01:22.679
beautiful,
sympathetic,

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.439
responsive watery image toward
Adam.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:34.082
Eve had said,
"thy gentle hand / seiz'd mine,

00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:39.097
I yielded."
Theirs is a continual dance of

00:01:39.097 --> 00:01:43.811
seizing and yielding.
You have his assertion of power

00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:48.848
and her gracious resignation,
although it's a gentle use of

00:01:48.848 --> 00:01:50.935
power,
on the one hand,

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:55.014
and it's an independent and
consensual resignation,

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:58.195
on the other.
Through this dance Milton,

00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:01.658
I think, was trying to
establish a model of human

00:02:01.658 --> 00:02:05.409
interaction really distinct from
simple coercion,

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.329
or completely distinct from
simple coercion.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.940
It's distinct from the simple
exercise of brute force that,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.391
I think, we often associate
with life in a hierarchically

00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:20.462
organized society.
Human interaction in this poem

00:02:20.462 --> 00:02:23.560
is founded on the principle of
consent.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.813
In the Miltonic commonwealth of
Eden -- and we think of it as a

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:30.970
commonwealth -- no one can be
forced to act.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.889
Eve has to choose to act.
She has to consent to act.

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.910
She yields, which is for Milton
not actually a resignation.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.731
It's a positive,
deliberate action,

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:49.688
and she has the right of
consent because she possesses

00:02:49.688 --> 00:02:55.982
for Milton an inalienable
capacity for free will and free

00:02:55.982 --> 00:02:59.735
choice.So,
this account of Eve's first

00:02:59.735 --> 00:03:02.523
exercise of free will,
the one that I've just given

00:03:02.523 --> 00:03:06.036
you -- her yielding to Adam when
he seizes her hand -- that's at

00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:08.726
least,
I think, the official one that

00:03:08.726 --> 00:03:12.741
the poem urges us to accept,
according to what I'm thinking

00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:15.509
of as the poem's official
philosophy,

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:19.366
because it seems to be a
guarantee, in some way,

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:23.961
subtended by the narrator and
authoritative forces in the

00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:26.741
poem.
According to this philosophy,

00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:30.896
Eve yields to Adam freely and
willingly because she comes to

00:03:30.896 --> 00:03:35.333
recognize his superior nature.
The poem presses on us a

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:40.969
philosophy whereby Eve's freedom
is entirely compatible with what

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:46.430
we're asked to take as the fact
of her inferiority to Adam.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.712
Satan himself explains
perfectly this philosophy,

00:03:49.712 --> 00:03:53.405
and I think ironically it's
Satan who gives us the best

00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:57.645
formulation of this coexistence
of freedom and hierarchy in the

00:03:57.645 --> 00:04:02.090
poem: that freedom and hierarchy
are absolutely compatible.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.700
Satan will tell Abdiel in Book
Five:

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.924
[F]or Orders and Degrees
Jar not with liberty,

00:04:11.924 --> 00:04:16.868
but well consist.
Who can in reason then or right

00:04:16.868 --> 00:04:19.213
assume
Monarchy over such as live by

00:04:19.213 --> 00:04:21.610
right
His equals, if in power and

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.980
splendor less,
In freedom equal?

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.572
But Milton's poetry -- well,
think how odd it is,

00:04:29.572 --> 00:04:31.143
[laughs]
first of all,

00:04:31.143 --> 00:04:35.184
that it's Satan who's giving us
something like the only

00:04:35.184 --> 00:04:39.600
carefully articulated
authoritative position on this,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.940
to say the least,
controversial matter.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.784
Milton's poetry is invariably
more sophisticated than what we

00:04:47.784 --> 00:04:51.564
can think of as the official
dogma or the authoritative line

00:04:51.564 --> 00:04:54.327
of the poem.
Perhaps that fact is revealed

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:57.923
or exposed to us by the fact
that it's Satan who's giving us,

00:04:57.923 --> 00:05:00.560
in this instance,
the authoritative line.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.565
It's important to keep this
distinction in mind because this

00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:09.808
poem simply cannot be reduced.
Sometimes it tries to be

00:05:09.808 --> 00:05:12.992
reduced, but it cannot be
reduced, to those ringing

00:05:12.992 --> 00:05:16.812
declarations of what sound like
the official positions of the

00:05:16.812 --> 00:05:20.060
poem.Think how complicated
it is with Eve.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.566
Eve's account of that beautiful
pool-side reverie was so filled

00:05:25.566 --> 00:05:29.740
with pathos and longing that
it's impossible,

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.786
I think, not to feel at least a
little bit of disappointment

00:05:32.786 --> 00:05:35.420
when she consents finally to her
union with Adam.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.828
It's almost -- I don't know --
this kind of a sense in which

00:05:38.828 --> 00:05:41.931
she's sold out.
Of course, we're happy that she

00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:45.695
has a mate who's another person
and not merely a smooth,

00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:47.532
watery image.
Nonetheless,

00:05:47.532 --> 00:05:50.624
there's a sense of
disappointment that attends that

00:05:50.624 --> 00:05:53.690
choice that she makes.
Initially for Eve,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.250
I am at least convinced there
seemed to be nothing like

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.440
freedom at all.
She remembers having gazed at

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.723
that pleasing image in the
reflective pool and she recalls

00:06:04.723 --> 00:06:08.122
being pulled away from that
smiling and sympathetic image by

00:06:08.122 --> 00:06:11.290
that mysterious voice that had
guided her to Adam.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.614
I think this is one of the most
moving lines in the entire poem

00:06:15.614 --> 00:06:19.240
when Eve recalls the feeling of
helplessness that she

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.170
experienced when she heard that
voice.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.187
This is how she explains it
later to Adam:

00:06:25.187 --> 00:06:28.057
"what could I do,
/ but follow straight,

00:06:28.057 --> 00:06:32.620
invisibly thus led?"In
other words, "What could I do?"

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.940
Not a bad question:
what could she do?

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.551
The subordination of woman to
man in heterosexual union in

00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:44.920
Paradise Lost seemed
entirely compulsory at that

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.407
moment,
and Eve, it seemed,

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:52.620
on some level had to be coerced
to unite herself with this less

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.561
pleasing Adam.
For a moment at least,

00:06:55.561 --> 00:06:59.063
Milton seemed to be on the
brink of something like a

00:06:59.063 --> 00:07:02.360
powerful critique of the
so-called naturalness of

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.346
normative sexual behavior;
because there's at least some

00:07:06.346 --> 00:07:09.673
suggestion here that Eve's
attraction to Adam was not

00:07:09.673 --> 00:07:12.585
freely chosen at all.
It was chosen for her,

00:07:12.585 --> 00:07:16.400
it was assigned to her.All
of this is a way of saying that

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.714
Milton is doing something
extraordinary complicated in

00:07:19.714 --> 00:07:23.355
Paradise Lost.
He justaposes -- he does this

00:07:23.355 --> 00:07:26.829
consistently -- the rhetoric of
rational consent,

00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:29.615
on the one hand,
with the competing rhetoric of

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:32.399
coercion: maybe that word's a
little strong,

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:35.394
but a competing rhetoric of
something like a gentle

00:07:35.394 --> 00:07:38.209
compulsion, if that oxymoron
makes any sense.

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:40.924
There's a way in which this
entire scene,

00:07:40.924 --> 00:07:45.199
which is intended to assert the
politics of rational consent,

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:48.355
provides at the very same
moment something like a critique

00:07:48.355 --> 00:07:50.459
of the politics of rational
consent.

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:55.930
We know that Eve's freely
willed act of yielding followed

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.350
in time Adam's exertion of
force.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.071
However gentle Adam is,
"thy gentle hand / seiz'd

00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:07.905
mine," he's still seized Eve,
and Milton's,

00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:10.804
I think, remarkably
honest.So this is why I'm

00:08:10.804 --> 00:08:13.160
always pushing you to agree with
me,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.026
[laughs]
or compelling you to agree with

00:08:16.026 --> 00:08:20.069
me, that Milton deserves a
little bit of credit here.

00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:23.306
Milton's amazingly honest in
his account of Eve's first

00:08:23.306 --> 00:08:26.482
exercise of her free will,
and I think we can think of

00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:30.814
this as her first free act.
Of course, it is an unduly

00:08:30.814 --> 00:08:35.643
circumscribed act of freedom.
Milton's poetry in a lot of

00:08:35.643 --> 00:08:40.100
ways is constantly questioning
the legitimacy of a doctrine of

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.266
free will in a world that has
been arranged and conjugated

00:08:44.266 --> 00:08:48.841
like the one that Eden has been.
It's along a principle of

00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:53.482
hierarchy.So Book Four had
explored in extraordinary detail

00:08:53.482 --> 00:08:57.974
the complexities of hierarchy
and freedom with respect to the

00:08:57.974 --> 00:09:02.718
relation between the sexes.
Book Five is also interested in

00:09:02.718 --> 00:09:06.886
this uneasy but important
relation between hierarchy and

00:09:06.886 --> 00:09:09.554
freedom.
It's almost as if Book Four

00:09:09.554 --> 00:09:13.835
hadn't sufficiently put to rest
the logical problem that on some

00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:17.980
level is constantly eating away
at the center of the poem.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.411
Book Five takes up this problem
once again, but it takes it up

00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:26.001
-- as we, of course,
should have been led to expect

00:09:26.001 --> 00:09:29.320
-- from an entirely different
perspective.So,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.368
as I just said,
in Book Four the hierarchical

00:09:32.368 --> 00:09:36.594
principle of superiority and of
excellence was the superiority

00:09:36.594 --> 00:09:38.621
of man to woman.
In Book Five,

00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:41.235
the central hierarchical access
is a little different,

00:09:41.235 --> 00:09:44.958
or a lot different.
It involves the superiority of

00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:49.356
angels over human beings,
and this new hierarchical

00:09:49.356 --> 00:09:53.490
opposition -- it's performing a
lot of work.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.863
One of the things that it's
certainly doing is forcing us to

00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:59.721
rethink the hierarchical
opposition that Milton had

00:09:59.721 --> 00:10:04.107
established in Book Four,
and that's because hierarchy is

00:10:04.107 --> 00:10:09.250
no longer gendered in Book Five.
Milton's not concerned here

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.107
with sex.
He's concerned rather with

00:10:12.107 --> 00:10:16.240
degrees of materiality among all
of God's creatures.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.266
Angels are less material,
less corporeally burdened

00:10:20.266 --> 00:10:23.648
creatures than Adam and Eve,
and therefore,

00:10:23.648 --> 00:10:26.870
within this system they're
superior.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:31.110
In this larger vision of a kind
of cosmic principle of hierarchy

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.103
in which lighter,
more ethereal things are

00:10:34.103 --> 00:10:37.245
superior to heavier,
denser, grosser material

00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:39.590
things,
we can see a way in which the

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.570
gender distinction simply drops
out of the equation,

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.620
because Milton gives us no
reason to think that Adam and

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.228
Eve are anything but equal in
the degrees of their

00:10:50.228 --> 00:10:53.716
corporeality.
Sexual inequality simply seems

00:10:53.716 --> 00:10:58.411
insignificant here from this new
perspective in Book Five.So

00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:02.958
Raphael descends into Eden --
the Archangel Raphael -- in Book

00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:07.281
Five in order to warn Adam and
Eve not to eat the forbidden

00:11:07.281 --> 00:11:09.047
fruit.
In doing so,

00:11:09.047 --> 00:11:12.634
he provides an elaborate
account of -- and I've already

00:11:12.634 --> 00:11:15.984
discussed this,
but I have to discuss it again

00:11:15.984 --> 00:11:19.576
because for me it's so
outrageous and so daring and

00:11:19.576 --> 00:11:23.240
such an absolutely lovable
religious heterodoxy,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.940
maybe it's even a heresy -- the
heterodoxy of monism.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.440
I'll remind you briefly of what
monism is.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.291
It's the philosophy whereby
there can be no such thing as a

00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:38.009
firm and absolute distinction
between body and spirit.

00:11:38.009 --> 00:11:42.402
The world can't be divided into
soul and matter as it could be

00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:46.361
divided with absolute clarity
for Milton's contemporary,

00:11:46.361 --> 00:11:49.812
Descartes.
The entire cosmos for Milton is

00:11:49.812 --> 00:11:54.382
made of one huge blob of matter,
and this matter is nothing

00:11:54.382 --> 00:11:57.769
other, ultimately,
than the body of God.

00:11:57.769 --> 00:12:05.245
This is what Raphael explains
to Adam at line 469 of Book

00:12:05.245 --> 00:12:09.179
Five.
This is page 313 in the Hughes

00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:12.750
edition.
So this is Raphael to Adam: 

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.466
O Adam,
one Almighty is [that's God],

00:12:16.466 --> 00:12:18.668
from whom
All things proceed,

00:12:18.668 --> 00:12:22.176
and up to him return,
If not deprav'd from good,

00:12:22.176 --> 00:12:25.072
created all
Such to perfection,

00:12:25.072 --> 00:12:28.863
one first matter all,
Indu'd with various forms,

00:12:28.863 --> 00:12:31.208
various degrees
Of substance,

00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:35.480
and in things that live,
of life.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.110
"One first matter all," all
things derived from the "one

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.903
first matter" which is,
of course, God:

00:12:41.903 --> 00:12:46.096
this is the ex deo
theory of creation (creatio

00:12:46.096 --> 00:12:48.740
ex deo),
as opposed to the orthodox

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.106
theory of creation,
which is creatio ex

00:12:51.106 --> 00:12:54.569
nihilo -- the notion that
God created the universe out of

00:12:54.569 --> 00:12:57.459
nothing.
Milton has God creating the

00:12:57.459 --> 00:13:01.500
universe out of God himself,
from the body of God.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.719
In this ex deo creation
scenario, there's no qualitative

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:12.107
difference between the substance
comprising men and the substance

00:13:12.107 --> 00:13:15.414
comprising angels.
The difference is simply one of

00:13:15.414 --> 00:13:16.883
degree.
This has been brilliantly

00:13:16.883 --> 00:13:18.590
argued by the critic William
Kerrigan.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:23.456
It's a difference of degree
rather than a difference of

00:13:23.456 --> 00:13:28.295
kind: angels are simply lighter.
The corporeal substance that

00:13:28.295 --> 00:13:32.100
makes up their bodies is more
attenuated, it's more rarefied,

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.059
than that in human beings.
We are all more condensed,

00:13:36.059 --> 00:13:40.788
we are "grosser" creatures,
to use one of Milton's favorite

00:13:40.788 --> 00:13:44.490
words here.
Our grosser bodies are more

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:50.178
compacted, they're of a denser
consistency than the light and

00:13:50.178 --> 00:13:54.824
airy bodies of heavenly
angels.Except for this

00:13:54.824 --> 00:13:59.850
differentiation by the degree of
substantiality,

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:04.159
human beings and angels are
qualitatively identical.

00:14:04.159 --> 00:14:06.654
We're made of the same stuff,
it's just a matter of how

00:14:06.654 --> 00:14:09.564
closely packed the stuff is.
Milton even treats us to a

00:14:09.564 --> 00:14:12.848
scene of Adam and Eve -- because
it's thinkable in such a

00:14:12.848 --> 00:14:15.902
monistic universe,
although it's wild -- of Adam

00:14:15.902 --> 00:14:19.169
and Eve actually eating with the
Archangel Raphael.

00:14:19.169 --> 00:14:23.685
I think this must have blown
Milton's contemporaries away,

00:14:23.685 --> 00:14:28.121
because from any orthodox
perspective this attribution of

00:14:28.121 --> 00:14:33.032
what Milton would call a "gross"
activity like eating to one of

00:14:33.032 --> 00:14:36.786
God's heavenly minions,
one of the angels,

00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:40.913
would have to be seen as -- if
it's not blasphemous,

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:44.060
it's certainly indecorous.
But this is,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.662
of course, a poem that's
centered around an illicit act

00:14:47.662 --> 00:14:50.714
of eating;
and so Milton will turn the

00:14:50.714 --> 00:14:55.082
entire activity of eating into
the premise of an entire

00:14:55.082 --> 00:14:59.369
philosophy of the relation of
human creatures to their

00:14:59.369 --> 00:15:03.731
God.In that "all" of God,
all of God's creatures need to

00:15:03.731 --> 00:15:07.835
eat.
Angels and men can be seen to

00:15:07.835 --> 00:15:10.401
be equals.
This is essentially Raphael's

00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:13.610
logic.
Look at line 411 of Book Five.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.429
Raphael tells Adam,
this is page 312,

00:15:16.429 --> 00:15:19.485
that angels are a lot like
human beings:

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:23.465
"they hear,
see, smell, touch,

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:30.789
taste, / tasting concoct,
digest, assimilate."

00:15:30.789 --> 00:15:34.818
We're soon to learn that angels
also have sex because,

00:15:34.818 --> 00:15:39.000
as we know, spirits "can either
sex assume," or both.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.037
But we're about to find out
here something,

00:15:42.037 --> 00:15:46.304
I think, that's a little more
shocking even than the fact of

00:15:46.304 --> 00:15:49.848
angelic eroticism:
angels have digestive tracts in

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:53.417
Milton's heaven,
and like human beings they have

00:15:53.417 --> 00:15:57.501
within their bodies some kind of
mechanism for the elimination of

00:15:57.501 --> 00:16:01.074
ingested substances -- the
elimination of substances that

00:16:01.074 --> 00:16:03.690
cannot be assimilated into the
body.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.350
Milton's angels actually
excrete.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.200
This is a remarkable feat of
literary daring,

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.101
to be sure, but it's also a
magnificent feat of the human

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:20.795
imagination on Milton's part.
This is what the narrator seems

00:16:20.795 --> 00:16:24.000
to be referring to when he
discusses Raphael's hunger.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.239
This is line 437:
"what redounds,

00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:32.200
transpires / through Spirits
with ease…"

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.876
It's so easy to miss:
"what redounds,

00:16:34.876 --> 00:16:38.519
transpires / through Spirits
with ease…"

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:44.312
What stays, what can't be
assimilated into the body,

00:16:44.312 --> 00:16:50.899
gets expelled easily.Milton
is so eager here -- now,

00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:53.509
we have to ask ourselves,
why is Milton doing this?

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:55.247
He's so eager,
I'm convinced,

00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:58.660
to demonstrate the essential
metaphysical equivalence of

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.446
human beings and angels that he
is quite prepared to ask us to

00:17:02.446 --> 00:17:06.926
imagine the unimaginable.
Angels are exceedingly regular,

00:17:06.926 --> 00:17:10.714
Milton is telling us.
"What redounds," that food

00:17:10.714 --> 00:17:13.979
which remains in excess in the
angel's body,

00:17:13.979 --> 00:17:17.319
"transpires / through Spirits
with ease."

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:20.338
Of course, as we know,
Milton was acutely interested

00:17:20.338 --> 00:17:22.470
in his own gastrointestinal
tract,

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.647
having blamed his blindness on
a digestive problem.But

00:17:25.647 --> 00:17:28.880
there's a lot more here than
merely a personal interest.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.681
Eating is so central to this
poem that it's actually

00:17:32.681 --> 00:17:36.632
something like a digestive
process of assimilation and

00:17:36.632 --> 00:17:40.657
excretion that would have
enabled the unfallen Adam and

00:17:40.657 --> 00:17:44.310
Eve to become angels eventually
themselves.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:49.900
Turn to line 493.
This is page 313.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:55.983
It was to be Adam and Eve's
good fortune to watch their own

00:17:55.983 --> 00:18:01.574
gross corporeal bodies slowly,
gradually shed their dense

00:18:01.574 --> 00:18:06.130
matter as they assumed the airy
lightness of angels.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.519
How will they attain this
extraordinary achievement,

00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:12.720
this wafting up to heaven?
They'll do it by eating.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.880
Look at line 493.
Raphael's explaining that as

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.118
things are now,
in a pinch angels are capable

00:18:20.118 --> 00:18:23.210
of a nutritional kind of
condescension.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.540
They can eat the same food that
human beings eat when they don't

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.582
have a choice.
Right now, Adam and Eve

00:18:30.582 --> 00:18:35.397
probably couldn't survive on
angelic nectar if that is all

00:18:35.397 --> 00:18:39.790
they had to live on,
probably, but Raphael adds:

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:47.361
[T]ime may come when men
With Angels may participate,

00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:50.383
and find
No inconvenient Diet,

00:18:50.383 --> 00:18:53.664
nor too light Fare:
And from these corporal

00:18:53.664 --> 00:18:56.797
nutriments perhaps
Your bodies may at last turn

00:18:56.797 --> 00:19:00.481
all to spirit,
Improv'd by tract of time,

00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:03.799
and wing'd ascend
Ethereal, as wee,

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:08.288
or may at choice
Here or in Heav'nly Paradises

00:19:08.288 --> 00:19:10.319
dwell;
[and this is obviously the

00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:13.980
kicker:]
If ye be found obedient.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.019
Milton is going out of his way
to provide Adam and Eve with a

00:19:17.019 --> 00:19:21.448
motive for remaining obedient.
By a simple process of eating

00:19:21.448 --> 00:19:25.129
-- virtuous eating,
virtuous digestion,

00:19:25.129 --> 00:19:30.650
and the consequent activity of
the virtuous subliming,

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.753
that's Milton's term,
of gross matter into spirit --

00:19:33.753 --> 00:19:38.477
Adam and Eve will eventually,
gradually begin to ascend to

00:19:38.477 --> 00:19:44.212
the winged state of angelhood.
They will metabolize themselves

00:19:44.212 --> 00:19:46.966
into angels.
It's one of the most extreme

00:19:46.966 --> 00:19:49.644
visions and one of the most
beautiful visions,

00:19:49.644 --> 00:19:51.490
[laughs]
however cockamamie,

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.959
of human progress ever
depicted, I think.Raphael's

00:19:55.959 --> 00:20:00.682
account of the superiority of
spiritual matter over gross

00:20:00.682 --> 00:20:04.983
matter is without question
another one of the poem's

00:20:04.983 --> 00:20:10.310
hierarchical visions,
but the amazing process of what

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:16.215
we could think of as what would
have been the angelization of

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:21.529
men and women does something
really quite alarming,

00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:24.469
I think, to the principle of
hierarchy as it's been presented

00:20:24.469 --> 00:20:26.711
so far.
The metaphysical hierarchy of

00:20:26.711 --> 00:20:30.375
the degree of material density,
which is the concern of Book

00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:33.956
Five, isn't fixed.
It's not static in Milton's

00:20:33.956 --> 00:20:37.648
universe.
This is a mobile society that

00:20:37.648 --> 00:20:42.559
Raphael is imagining.
The hierarchy here is flexible.

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:47.025
It's much more flexible than
the gendered hierarchy was among

00:20:47.025 --> 00:20:51.004
human beings in Book Four.
If Adam and Eve manage not to

00:20:51.004 --> 00:20:53.682
fall, they will arrive,
we have to assume,

00:20:53.682 --> 00:20:57.536
equally at a state of angelic
perfection in a state in which

00:20:57.536 --> 00:21:01.390
gender differences simply don't
obtain because angels,

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:06.298
as we know, "can either sex
assume," or both.There were

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:11.207
a few other radical thinkers in
the seventeenth century who

00:21:11.207 --> 00:21:16.369
embraced a monistic vision of
the universe like Milton's.

00:21:16.369 --> 00:21:19.943
Almost invariably,
this monism had a kind of

00:21:19.943 --> 00:21:24.016
leftist, progressive,
and in some cases actually a

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:28.788
communist energy to it.
I've written the name of one of

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:32.460
Milton's contemporaries,
Gerrard Winstanley,

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.380
who was maybe not England's
first communist but England's

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:40.152
first important communist,
writing fifteen or so years

00:21:40.152 --> 00:21:43.795
before Paradise Lost.
The bodies of all men and

00:21:43.795 --> 00:21:47.930
women are for Winstanley -- as
later for Milton -- are equally

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.319
infused with heavenly spirit and
heavenly soul.

00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:55.269
For Winstanley -- Milton
wouldn't permit himself to go

00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:59.293
quite this far -- this
physiological equality seemed to

00:21:59.293 --> 00:22:02.200
guarantee their political
equality.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.001
In adopting this doctrine of
monism that had been developed

00:22:06.001 --> 00:22:09.606
or worked out by much more
radical thinkers like Gerrard

00:22:09.606 --> 00:22:12.771
Winstanley,
Milton is really on some level

00:22:12.771 --> 00:22:16.480
consciously adopting a
philosophy of body and spirit

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.796
that works to undo,
and maybe it works to

00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:24.619
undermine, that patriarchal
insistence on Adam's superiority

00:22:24.619 --> 00:22:26.876
over Eve.
On some level,

00:22:26.876 --> 00:22:30.888
some of the philosophy in Book
Five, I think,

00:22:30.888 --> 00:22:36.541
is working at some subterranean
stage to undermine or dismantle

00:22:36.541 --> 00:22:38.977
the Edenic,
the paradisal,

00:22:38.977 --> 00:22:43.029
hierarchy.So Adam and Eve
before the Fall are given the

00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:46.941
opportunity to reach their
heavenly destinations on their

00:22:46.941 --> 00:22:49.731
own.
Now just think how radical that

00:22:49.731 --> 00:22:53.705
is when you compare it to any
mainstream notion of the way

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:56.232
Christianity works.
Adam and Eve,

00:22:56.232 --> 00:22:59.592
had they never fallen,
had they never sinned,

00:22:59.592 --> 00:23:03.792
would never have needed to rely
on a God or a Messiah to

00:23:03.792 --> 00:23:07.763
intervene -- an external
redeemer to move in and save

00:23:07.763 --> 00:23:10.693
them,
or even to reward them,

00:23:10.693 --> 00:23:14.828
for their virtue.
Their virtuous behavior would

00:23:14.828 --> 00:23:19.321
have been itself a reward.
We can think of them as having

00:23:19.321 --> 00:23:22.559
been in a position almost to
save themselves,

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:26.690
and Milton is arriving at this
-- it's a wild and really daring

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:30.488
alternative to the orthodox
Christian vision of redemption

00:23:30.488 --> 00:23:34.019
and salvation.I think it's
this orthodox notion of

00:23:34.019 --> 00:23:38.349
Christianity that Milton always
felt so uncomfortable with.

00:23:38.349 --> 00:23:41.291
Were it not for the Fall,
there would have been no need

00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:44.288
for the heavenly Father to
sacrifice the Son in order to

00:23:44.288 --> 00:23:48.373
save fallen humanity.
Human beings would [laughs]

00:23:48.373 --> 00:23:53.720
just waft up to the pearly
gates like helium balloons,

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.259
lighter even than air,
and with no need for an

00:23:58.259 --> 00:24:03.066
external redeemer.
In some ways Milton is flirting

00:24:03.066 --> 00:24:07.799
with something -- and I think
the young adult book writer,

00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:10.562
Philip Pullman,
absolutely has put his finger

00:24:10.562 --> 00:24:12.759
on something important in
Milton,

00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:15.923
and he's a great leader and fan
of Milton's -- is flirting with

00:24:15.923 --> 00:24:18.730
something that we would
recognize as science fiction.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.300
It's a secular image of
salvation certainly,

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.230
but it's a proto-scientific
image of salvation.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:29.259
Unfallen salvation is something
like a scientific process.

00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:33.473
It's the logical and inevitable
result of just a particular type

00:24:33.473 --> 00:24:36.675
of virtuous,
natural behavior.Milton

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:41.625
arrives at a theology that does
something that a theology is

00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:45.569
never supposed to do:
it's a radical theology of

00:24:45.569 --> 00:24:50.268
bodily transformation that
essentially does away with God

00:24:50.268 --> 00:24:53.960
or does away with God as we know
him.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.920
Who needs God?
Adam and Eve will continue to

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.420
eat.
They'll eat virtuously.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.756
They'll be good people.
They'll become angels,

00:25:00.756 --> 00:25:04.223
and eventually they will be
subsumed into that universal

00:25:04.223 --> 00:25:08.005
ball of spiritual matter at that
later point when God becomes

00:25:08.005 --> 00:25:11.079
"All in All."
That's that distant point in

00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:14.958
time where there will simply be
no ontological difference

00:25:14.958 --> 00:25:18.932
between man and woman,
between angel and man,

00:25:18.932 --> 00:25:23.825
or between us and
God.Raphael's philosophy of

00:25:23.825 --> 00:25:29.942
monism offers a truly radical
vision of an exaltation -- this

00:25:29.942 --> 00:25:35.752
prelapsarian notion of an
exaltation of Adam and Eve up to

00:25:35.752 --> 00:25:38.628
heaven.
They could have exalted

00:25:38.628 --> 00:25:42.468
themselves, and presumably we
all could have exalted ourselves

00:25:42.468 --> 00:25:46.049
simply by being good,
by doing it ourselves,

00:25:46.049 --> 00:25:51.034
but this daring vision of a
radical self-determination

00:25:51.034 --> 00:25:56.395
couldn't possibly be more
violently opposed to the version

00:25:56.395 --> 00:26:01.098
of exaltation that Raphael
explains to Adam and Eve

00:26:01.098 --> 00:26:06.359
elsewhere in Book Five.
This scene I know you remember,

00:26:06.359 --> 00:26:09.979
because it's so upsetting and
so unforgettable:

00:26:09.979 --> 00:26:14.274
on Adam's prompting,
Raphael goes on to describe the

00:26:14.274 --> 00:26:17.960
exaltation, the anointing,
of the Son of God.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.934
It's an event that comes as
close to anything as explaining

00:26:21.934 --> 00:26:24.470
the very first mystery of the
poem,

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:29.413
or the central mystery of the
poem -- that being the cause,

00:26:29.413 --> 00:26:34.522
the origin, of Satan's fall.
You can refer here to your

00:26:34.522 --> 00:26:39.529
handy little chronology,
written by Alastair Fowler,

00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:44.674
of events in Paradise Lost.
The origin of Satan's fall

00:26:44.674 --> 00:26:48.418
is without question one of the
most crucial problems that we

00:26:48.418 --> 00:26:51.565
have when we confront this poem.
On some level,

00:26:51.565 --> 00:26:55.463
God's ways can't be justified
until the origin of man's Fall

00:26:55.463 --> 00:26:58.986
can be explained or understood,
and man's Fall can't be

00:26:58.986 --> 00:27:02.148
understood or explained or
justified until Satan's fall is

00:27:02.148 --> 00:27:04.859
explained.
To account for Satan's

00:27:04.859 --> 00:27:08.762
fall, Milton relies -- he makes
all this up and it's

00:27:08.762 --> 00:27:11.709
magnificent.
He's relying here on the text

00:27:11.709 --> 00:27:14.813
of the second Psalm,
a chapter of the Bible that he

00:27:14.813 --> 00:27:17.730
had himself translated into
English in 1653.

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:21.910
Now the second Psalm imagines
the Messiah speaking.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:28.171
This is that verse:
"[T]he Lord to me hath said,

00:27:28.171 --> 00:27:35.539
Thou art my Son;
I have begotten thee this day."

00:27:35.539 --> 00:27:38.964
No one has ever known what to
do with that passage from the

00:27:38.964 --> 00:27:41.752
second Psalm.
The idea that the Messiah could

00:27:41.752 --> 00:27:45.311
actually remember the day that
God had begotten him had for

00:27:45.311 --> 00:27:48.994
centuries and millennia provided
biblical commentators with a

00:27:48.994 --> 00:27:51.940
paradox that really bordered on
the absurd.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.690
What could God have meant when
he said, "I have begotten thee

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:01.441
this day"?Milton worries and
worries this problem of this

00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:03.472
begetting.
He does this throughout

00:28:03.472 --> 00:28:05.759
Paradise Lost and he does
it in a number of ways.

00:28:05.759 --> 00:28:10.160
He transforms this mysterious
declaration that he has lifted

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.337
from the second Psalm into --
he's turned it into what is

00:28:14.337 --> 00:28:18.440
essentially the originary event
of the entire poem.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.891
As you can see from the
chronology of the poem that

00:28:22.891 --> 00:28:26.987
Fowler gives us,
the exaltation of Milton's Son

00:28:26.987 --> 00:28:32.685
of God (and Fowler unfortunately
calls him Christ) doesn't really

00:28:32.685 --> 00:28:36.820
function as a Christ.
Milton would never in a million

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.332
years, certainly,
in Paradise Lost call

00:28:39.332 --> 00:28:41.844
this fellow Christ.
He doesn't call him Jesus

00:28:41.844 --> 00:28:44.259
either because the Son of God
isn't Jesus yet.

00:28:44.259 --> 00:28:47.697
He's preexistent but he's not a
Christ, I think,

00:28:47.697 --> 00:28:51.647
in part because Milton doesn't
want us to confuse or to

00:28:51.647 --> 00:28:56.109
construe this Son of God with
anything that we've learned from

00:28:56.109 --> 00:29:01.230
any of our Sunday school classes
or any exposure to traditional,

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:06.600
orthodox, mainstream Christian
Protestant or Catholic

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:13.002
thinking.This is the event
-- you'll remember how important

00:29:13.002 --> 00:29:19.199
first events are in Paradise
Lost -- this is the event

00:29:19.199 --> 00:29:23.329
that seems to have happened
first.

00:29:23.329 --> 00:29:28.087
What occurred in heaven before
this moment, the poem gives us

00:29:28.087 --> 00:29:31.293
no definitive clue of,
although Satan knows there is

00:29:31.293 --> 00:29:33.720
something important that
happened before this moment,

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.157
and he makes an important
conjecture about it prior to

00:29:36.157 --> 00:29:39.033
this.
(We don't have time to look at

00:29:39.033 --> 00:29:44.226
this today, but you may want to
study for yourself Satan's own

00:29:44.226 --> 00:29:48.527
theory of a first Creation,
and that's the creation of the

00:29:48.527 --> 00:29:51.789
angels.) So God the Father
assembles all of the angels.

00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:58.448
This is page 316 in the
Hughes, Book Five,

00:29:58.448 --> 00:30:01.463
line 600.
God delivers at line 600 a

00:30:01.463 --> 00:30:05.349
pronouncement that is by any
standards absolutely shocking.

00:30:05.349 --> 00:30:08.862
Satan, like the other angels,
was a son of God but,

00:30:08.862 --> 00:30:12.866
unlike the other Son of God --
or the other sons of God --

00:30:12.866 --> 00:30:16.869
Satan had been one of the first
archangels in heaven.

00:30:16.869 --> 00:30:20.855
The narrator suggests (this is
coming from the narrator) that

00:30:20.855 --> 00:30:24.309
Satan may have been the first
archangel in heaven,

00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:28.466
first both in God's favor and
also in his general preeminence

00:30:28.466 --> 00:30:32.000
over the other angels because
God liked him most,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.510
liked him best,
and also because he was simply

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:36.630
better than all of the other
angels;

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:40.345
and Milton continues his
meditation on the multiple

00:30:40.345 --> 00:30:44.952
meanings here of "first."Now
I'm going to read this passage

00:30:44.952 --> 00:30:48.104
to you,
and you tell me if you think

00:30:48.104 --> 00:30:53.191
Satan might have just a teensy
bit of a reason to be miffed at

00:30:53.191 --> 00:30:57.109
God's exaltation of another one
of his sons,

00:30:57.109 --> 00:31:00.860
or what we have to assume is
another one of his sons.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.914
This is God at line 600: 
Hear all ye Angels,

00:31:04.914 --> 00:31:08.101
Progeny of Light,
Thrones, Dominations,

00:31:08.101 --> 00:31:10.519
Princedoms, Vertues,
Powers,

00:31:10.519 --> 00:31:14.200
Hear my Decree,
which unrevok't shall stand.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.670
This day I have begot whom I
declare

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:21.630
My only Son,
and on this holy Hill

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:25.300
Him have anointed,
whom ye now behold

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:30.160
At my right hand;
your Head I him appoint;

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.559
And by my Self have sworn to
him shall bow

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:35.925
All knees in Heav'n,
and shall confess him

00:31:35.925 --> 00:31:40.030
Lord:Under his great
Vice-gerent Reign abide

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:46.840
United as one individual Soul
For ever happy.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.407
What's the tone of voice?
I'm [laughs]

00:31:48.407 --> 00:31:50.299
going to interrupt myself for a
moment.

00:31:50.299 --> 00:31:54.406
How are we [laughs]
to imagine God pronouncing that

00:31:54.406 --> 00:31:58.019
word "happy" after what he's
just told us?

00:31:58.019 --> 00:32:00.320
Under his great
Vice-gerent Reign abide

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:05.240
United as one individual Soule
For ever happy: him who disobeys

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.400
Mee disobeyes,
breaks union,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.907
and that day
Cast out from God and blessed

00:32:10.907 --> 00:32:14.730
vision, falls
Into utter darkness.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.684
This, of course,
is a vision of an exaltation

00:32:17.684 --> 00:32:21.779
almost diametrically opposed to
the exaltation of the unfallen

00:32:21.779 --> 00:32:24.130
Adam and Eve,
their wafting up.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.770
The Son of God,
the Messiah,

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.140
doesn't seem to have exalted
himself.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.300
Along what has already been
established is the recognizable

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.876
pattern of a kind of natural,
physiological ascent,

00:32:34.876 --> 00:32:39.546
and you can imagine Milton
could have pulled that off

00:32:39.546 --> 00:32:42.960
because he could pull off
anything.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.051
It's possible to imagine a
scenario whereby the Son had on

00:32:47.051 --> 00:32:51.143
some level eaten his way into
God's favor and achieved the

00:32:51.143 --> 00:32:55.019
status of Messiah through an
Adam and Eve-like virtuous

00:32:55.019 --> 00:32:57.968
metabolism,
floating up to the very top of

00:32:57.968 --> 00:33:00.559
God's throne before any of the
other angels.

00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:03.833
That's how damn good he was,
but that's not the story that

00:33:03.833 --> 00:33:06.695
we get.
According to the narrative we

00:33:06.695 --> 00:33:11.061
have, God the Father seems quite
simply to have decided

00:33:11.061 --> 00:33:15.509
arbitrarily to appoint one of
the angels over all of the

00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:18.420
others.
Why has he done this?

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.500
God does mention something
about the Son's merit.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.583
Well, he will mention something
about the Son's merit later in

00:33:24.583 --> 00:33:27.742
another scene of exaltation,
but it's one that's already

00:33:27.742 --> 00:33:31.391
been narrated and that's the
scene that we've already read in

00:33:31.391 --> 00:33:34.250
Book Three.As for this
moment right now,

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:36.989
the motives for this
declaration seem perfectly

00:33:36.989 --> 00:33:39.490
inexplicable and absolutely
inscrutable,

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:44.323
and it also seems clear that
this inscrutability is the point

00:33:44.323 --> 00:33:48.410
of the Father's declaration.
As William Empson writes

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:52.170
convincingly and brilliantly,
although mischievously,

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.347
in a wonderful book called
Milton's God,

00:33:54.347 --> 00:33:57.200
the Father's declaration
sounds like a challenge,

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.710
like it's intended to be taken
as a challenge.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:03.428
By saying, "On this day I have
begot the Messiah," God seems

00:34:03.428 --> 00:34:06.390
almost to be suggesting that --
I don't know,

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:11.865
that he's just created this guy
out of whole cloth for this very

00:34:11.865 --> 00:34:16.819
occasion, just made him and
raised this nobody to the rank

00:34:16.819 --> 00:34:20.834
of favorite.
It's possible that God has just

00:34:20.834 --> 00:34:25.745
bequeathed all of his power to
someone who hasn't even been

00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:30.909
around, someone who hasn't spent
eternity paying his dues.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:33.889
What could God have been
thinking?

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:38.148
The Father knows this is an
extraordinary thing to be

00:34:38.148 --> 00:34:42.079
declaring, and so he tries to
soften the blow,

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:47.499
I guess, this blow of this show
of favoritism by inviting the

00:34:47.499 --> 00:34:53.460
other angels to abide "under his
great Vice-gerent Reign…

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:58.780
/ united as one individual Soul
/ for ever happy."

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:03.389
By "individual" the Father
means "indivisible here."

00:35:03.389 --> 00:35:06.824
I'm convinced that the word
"individual," which only appears

00:35:06.824 --> 00:35:10.025
twice in Paradise Lost,
is one of the poem's most

00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:13.389
important words;
but it has its original

00:35:13.389 --> 00:35:18.363
meaning, its etymological
meaning, which simply means

00:35:18.363 --> 00:35:22.190
"can't be divided."On some
level,

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.603
the Father seems to be making a
stab at Milton's own monistic

00:35:25.603 --> 00:35:29.610
vision of egalitarianism.
The angels will all be united

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:34.211
as one individual soul,
but the Father will only invoke

00:35:34.211 --> 00:35:38.130
this harmonious,
indivisible union -- when?

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.015
After he's placed the Son of
God at the head of the other

00:35:42.015 --> 00:35:44.796
angels.
We're left to wonder just how

00:35:44.796 --> 00:35:48.887
we're supposed to reconcile this
image of an indivisible

00:35:48.887 --> 00:35:52.159
egalitarianism with the
competing image of an

00:35:52.159 --> 00:35:56.497
unyielding,
rigorously enforced angelic

00:35:56.497 --> 00:35:59.579
hierarchy.
You can recognize in this scene

00:35:59.579 --> 00:36:02.075
the opposition of
irreconcilables that we've

00:36:02.075 --> 00:36:05.791
already encountered,
the ones that had characterized

00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:08.710
the power relations in Milton's
Eden.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:12.442
Milton charges this scene in
heaven with its power,

00:36:12.442 --> 00:36:16.622
I think, by juxtaposing just
those two forces that he was

00:36:16.622 --> 00:36:20.280
continually attempting to unite
in Book Four.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.980
He yokes together the
principles of freedom and

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:30.599
equality, on the one hand,
and the opposing principle of

00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:35.803
hierarchical order,
on the other hand.Think how

00:36:35.803 --> 00:36:41.051
the politics in heaven here
parallel the political dynamic

00:36:41.051 --> 00:36:44.550
that we've already been exposed
to,

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:48.929
that we've already seen
operative on earth.

00:36:48.929 --> 00:36:53.519
In Book Four at that beautiful
originary moment at the pool

00:36:53.519 --> 00:36:58.267
side, Eve had -- I think quite
like Satan -- Eve had imagined

00:36:58.267 --> 00:37:01.670
herself great in favor and
preeminence.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.579
She's shaken from this
assumption of power and of

00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:08.337
absolute self-sufficiency when
she's suddenly told that there's

00:37:08.337 --> 00:37:12.380
another creature,
Adam, who has been appointed

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.789
her head.
Just as God does with Satan,

00:37:15.789 --> 00:37:18.987
Adam tries to soften the blow
[laughs]

00:37:18.987 --> 00:37:23.914
of this arbitrary declaration
of hierarchical supremacy by

00:37:23.914 --> 00:37:27.889
claiming to be united
indivisibly to Eve,

00:37:27.889 --> 00:37:31.264
so Adam declares to Eve -- he
seizes her hand,

00:37:31.264 --> 00:37:35.914
she yields, and he declares to
her that he will have her by his

00:37:35.914 --> 00:37:40.190
side "henceforth an individual
solace dear..."Milton's

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:44.539
clearly doing something here in
these two scenes with these

00:37:44.539 --> 00:37:47.989
noisy protestations of
indivisibility.

00:37:47.989 --> 00:37:52.028
He invokes the beautiful notion
of the interconnectedness of all

00:37:52.028 --> 00:37:55.681
of God's creatures that's
implicit in this monistic vision

00:37:55.681 --> 00:37:58.648
of the first matter,
but he only employs this

00:37:58.648 --> 00:38:01.922
beautiful image of a monistic
unity when he's placing an

00:38:01.922 --> 00:38:04.838
absolute divide between a
superior creature and an

00:38:04.838 --> 00:38:09.250
inferior one,
between a greater and a lesser

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.444
being.
On some level,

00:38:11.444 --> 00:38:16.497
and it's very troubling,
monistic indivisibility is

00:38:16.497 --> 00:38:22.460
always invoked at the most
divisive moments in the poem.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.268
We can think of these as the
crisis moments in Paradise

00:38:25.268 --> 00:38:27.216
Lost.
At these critical moments of

00:38:27.216 --> 00:38:29.929
the arbitrary subjection of one
party over the other,

00:38:29.929 --> 00:38:33.696
whether it's Adam over Eve or
the Son of God over Satan and

00:38:33.696 --> 00:38:37.046
the other angels,
you can see the emergence of

00:38:37.046 --> 00:38:40.598
another meaning,
the modern meaning of that word

00:38:40.598 --> 00:38:43.772
"individual":
"individual" as a noun rather

00:38:43.772 --> 00:38:46.719
than "individual" as an
adjective.

00:38:46.719 --> 00:38:50.505
Dictionaries and historians of
the English language claim that

00:38:50.505 --> 00:38:53.360
the modern meaning of the word
"individual,"

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.075
a noun referring to a person
who is self-sufficient,

00:38:57.075 --> 00:39:01.563
autonomous, independent,
a being -- that this noun

00:39:01.563 --> 00:39:07.268
doesn't appear in England until
later in the seventeenth

00:39:07.268 --> 00:39:10.495
century;
but I think that it's precisely

00:39:10.495 --> 00:39:14.397
at these crisis moments in
Paradise Lost that Milton

00:39:14.397 --> 00:39:17.496
uses the original,
the traditional sense of

00:39:17.496 --> 00:39:21.432
"individual," an adjective
meaning "indivisible," only to

00:39:21.432 --> 00:39:25.439
begin pushing that word and
forcing it into something like

00:39:25.439 --> 00:39:28.110
its modern sense of
"individual,"

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:34.651
the modern, essentially liberal
idea of a human being as an

00:39:34.651 --> 00:39:38.672
absolutely isolate,
self-determining,

00:39:38.672 --> 00:39:44.212
fundamentally unaffiliated
person.Here at the scene of

00:39:44.212 --> 00:39:48.780
the Son's exaltation Milton -- I
don't know.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:52.095
For a lot of readers,
this is really a repellant

00:39:52.095 --> 00:39:54.960
scene.
It's a scene of a tyrannical

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.000
and arbitrary ordering of a
society.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.369
Milton does this only to
display a little window,

00:40:01.369 --> 00:40:05.019
I think, onto a totally
different kind of society.

00:40:05.019 --> 00:40:08.925
You can see in this word
"individual" a glimpse into the

00:40:08.925 --> 00:40:12.119
world of what we can think of as
modernity.

00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:16.969
Paradise Lost is just on
the cusp of a liberal worldview,

00:40:16.969 --> 00:40:21.356
and the poem provides us a
glimpse of the liberal world of

00:40:21.356 --> 00:40:24.560
equal individuals,
a world of rational

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.772
self-determination and
self-exaltation rather than the

00:40:28.772 --> 00:40:33.382
arbitrary subjection of one
class of creatures over another

00:40:33.382 --> 00:40:38.310
class.So it's one thing for
Satan to witness this seemingly

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:42.721
arbitrary exaltation of the Son.
This arouses in him,

00:40:42.721 --> 00:40:45.737
as you can imagine,
feelings of injustice that,

00:40:45.737 --> 00:40:49.308
of course,
famously leave him to coax a

00:40:49.308 --> 00:40:55.230
third of all of the other angels
in a rebellion against God.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:58.906
That was bad enough,
but it's an entirely different

00:40:58.906 --> 00:41:02.142
matter, I think,
when Satan learns -- I don't

00:41:02.142 --> 00:41:06.554
know if "learns" is the right
verb -- when Satan hears in his

00:41:06.554 --> 00:41:11.187
discussion with Abdiel that God
created everything including the

00:41:11.187 --> 00:41:15.600
angels themselves by means of
the agency of the Son,

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.951
through the Son.
For Satan this is a

00:41:18.951 --> 00:41:23.489
mind-blowing revelation,
and it's hard to miss as so

00:41:23.489 --> 00:41:28.563
surprising because we take this
as just orthodoxy that any

00:41:28.563 --> 00:41:32.390
right-thinking Christian might
accept.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:41.449
Look at page 322.
This is line 835 of Book Five.

00:41:41.449 --> 00:41:44.712
When Abdiel tells Satan,
"Why are you so upset,

00:41:44.712 --> 00:41:46.695
Satan?
Of course, he would exalt the

00:41:46.695 --> 00:41:48.807
Son.
It was the Son through whom we

00:41:48.807 --> 00:41:52.668
were all created" -- this notion
just pushes Satan further than

00:41:52.668 --> 00:41:56.272
anything pushes him.
This new revelation pushes him

00:41:56.272 --> 00:42:00.836
into making one of the greatest
formulations of the modern -- an

00:42:00.836 --> 00:42:03.551
outrageous one,
but it's central to the modern

00:42:03.551 --> 00:42:05.479
principle of
individualism.Let me give

00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:08.699
you a little background.
Abdiel has traveled with Satan

00:42:08.699 --> 00:42:11.755
and the other disloyal angels,
the rebel angels,

00:42:11.755 --> 00:42:14.159
to the northern quarter of
heaven;

00:42:14.159 --> 00:42:17.792
but Abdiel, like Milton himself
during the English Revolution --

00:42:17.792 --> 00:42:21.136
and Abdiel was in some way
Milton's self-portrait -- Abdiel

00:42:21.136 --> 00:42:24.710
was willing to distance himself
from the mob sensibility of the

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.717
rebels.
He stands up to Satan with the

00:42:27.717 --> 00:42:31.254
pious rage, the zeal,
that Milton always fancied

00:42:31.254 --> 00:42:35.138
himself capable of.
So Abdiel asks Satan,

00:42:35.138 --> 00:42:41.718
and this is at the top of page
322, how he can dare to question

00:42:41.718 --> 00:42:47.980
God's justice in exalting the
Son over the other angels.

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:50.719
Abdiel tells Satan it was the 
Son, by whom

00:42:50.719 --> 00:42:53.530
As by his Word,
the mighty Father made

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:58.119
All things, ev'n thee,
and all the Spirits of Heav'n

00:42:58.119 --> 00:43:01.639
By him created in thir bright
degrees…

00:43:01.639 --> 00:43:04.487
Abdiel tells Satan that if it
weren't for the Son of God,

00:43:04.487 --> 00:43:06.420
Satan would never have been
created.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.194
It's Satan- [laughs]
who certainly seems to be

00:43:09.194 --> 00:43:11.475
shocked here,
and it's his response to

00:43:11.475 --> 00:43:15.003
Abdiel's claim that is,
I think, one of the most

00:43:15.003 --> 00:43:18.576
stunning, one of the most
outrageous moments in

00:43:18.576 --> 00:43:21.760
Paradise Lost.
Line 852.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:28.430
Satan is aghast that we were: 
[F]orm'd then sayest thou?

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.099
and the work 
Of secondary hands,

00:43:30.099 --> 00:43:33.470
by task transferr'd
From Father to his Son?

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:37.912
strange point and new!
Doctrine which we would know

00:43:37.912 --> 00:43:38.950
whence learnt:
who saw

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:42.179
When this creation was?
remember'st thou

00:43:42.179 --> 00:43:46.219
Thy making, while the Maker
gave thee being?

00:43:46.219 --> 00:43:50.360
We know no time when we were
not as now;

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.860
Know none before us,
self-begot, self-rais'd

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:58.360
By our own quick'ning power,
when fatal course

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:02.139
Had circl'd his full Orb,
the birth mature

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:07.659
Of this our native Heav'n,
Ethereal Sons.

00:44:07.659 --> 00:44:11.164
Now, nearly everyone agrees
that -- all Milton critics agree

00:44:11.164 --> 00:44:14.550
that this claim for angelic
self-creation is in one way or

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:17.877
the other crucial to our
understanding of the fall of the

00:44:17.877 --> 00:44:21.559
rebel angels and Satan's
justification of the rebellion.

00:44:21.559 --> 00:44:24.259
This claim of self-creation
obviously prepares Satan for

00:44:24.259 --> 00:44:27.155
that pronouncement that he will
make later in hell but which

00:44:27.155 --> 00:44:29.070
comes at the beginning of the
poem,

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:32.615
that claim for the absolute
priority of the mind:

00:44:32.615 --> 00:44:36.900
the mind is its own place and
can make a heaven of hell,

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:42.793
a hell of heaven.Now Abdiel
surely is right to insist that

00:44:42.793 --> 00:44:48.687
not only were the -- we have to
give it to Abdiel that he's on

00:44:48.687 --> 00:44:52.292
to something,
that the angels were created

00:44:52.292 --> 00:44:55.236
and not only that,
they were created in all

00:44:55.236 --> 00:44:58.320
likelihood through the agency of
the Son;

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.395
but even though Abdiel's right,
Satan's theory of angelic

00:45:02.395 --> 00:45:06.655
origin isn't easily dismissible.
It's not as easily dismissible

00:45:06.655 --> 00:45:09.334
as it is by C.S.
Lewis in the little quotation

00:45:09.334 --> 00:45:13.438
at the bottom of the handout.
I always try to make a little

00:45:13.438 --> 00:45:17.531
plug for the validity of at
least a little of a part of

00:45:17.531 --> 00:45:20.174
Satan's claim.
I want to do this because on

00:45:20.174 --> 00:45:22.981
some level, I think Satan's
outrageous argument here is one

00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:25.351
of the greatest things that
anybody gets to say in

00:45:25.351 --> 00:45:28.457
Paradise Lost,
 because if we're going

00:45:28.457 --> 00:45:30.921
to understand the origin of
Satan's fall,

00:45:30.921 --> 00:45:34.370
we have to understand something
about the origin of Satan

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:37.820
himself.You have the
chronology on the handout.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.833
It's right to place the
exaltation of the Son as the

00:45:40.833 --> 00:45:44.320
first event officially described
in Paradise Lost,

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.219
 but there's of course
an event that happened before

00:45:47.219 --> 00:45:50.369
that which Milton's narrative
very carefully never describes,

00:45:50.369 --> 00:45:55.019
and that's the creation of the
angels.

00:45:55.019 --> 00:45:58.658
So we get Satan's theory of the
creation of the angels and

00:45:58.658 --> 00:46:02.332
Abdiel, as we would expect,
takes great offense,

00:46:02.332 --> 00:46:07.525
but it's important -- and
Abdiel's right and Satan's wrong

00:46:07.525 --> 00:46:12.535
-- but it's important to
determine exactly what is wrong

00:46:12.535 --> 00:46:18.639
about Satan's theology here and
how it would counter Milton's.

00:46:18.639 --> 00:46:21.619
Satan's obviously wrong to
ascribe the creation of the

00:46:21.619 --> 00:46:24.766
angels to something like a
random occurrence of fate when

00:46:24.766 --> 00:46:27.504
Satan says,
"when fatal course / had

00:46:27.504 --> 00:46:30.932
circl'd his full Orb."
Milton's explained a number of

00:46:30.932 --> 00:46:34.212
times in the poem that there's
no such thing as a power called

00:46:34.212 --> 00:46:35.844
"fate,"
so that's easily

00:46:35.844 --> 00:46:39.607
dismissible.But it's not
absolutely clear to me that

00:46:39.607 --> 00:46:43.712
Satan is wrong to claim that the
angels are "self-rais'd / by

00:46:43.712 --> 00:46:48.552
their own quick'ning power."
I think on some level this has

00:46:48.552 --> 00:46:52.684
to be seen as true,
at least according to what we

00:46:52.684 --> 00:46:58.194
know of the dynamic processes in
Milton's account of the monistic

00:46:58.194 --> 00:47:01.440
Creation.
God has impregnated matter with

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.258
spirit, and after this initial
act of impregnation he seems

00:47:05.258 --> 00:47:09.340
able to allow this spiritualized
matter pretty much to organize

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:13.553
itself on its own into all these
beautiful and varied forms of

00:47:13.553 --> 00:47:16.457
creation.
If we're not completely shocked

00:47:16.457 --> 00:47:19.375
to hear Satan's claim for having
raised himself by his own

00:47:19.375 --> 00:47:22.322
quickening power,
at least upon a rereading of

00:47:22.322 --> 00:47:26.647
Paradise Lost that might
be because it looks an awful lot

00:47:26.647 --> 00:47:30.559
like the theory of creation that
we get in Book Seven.

00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:34.527
It also sounds like a moment in
Book Three that we've already

00:47:34.527 --> 00:47:38.297
encountered: when the angel
Uriel -- the angel that Milton

00:47:38.297 --> 00:47:41.670
credits for having the best
eyesight in heaven,

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:45.490
rather remarkably -- when Uriel
gives us his eyewitness account

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:49.824
of the Creation,
it sounds a little bit like

00:47:49.824 --> 00:47:56.869
Satan's.Satan's argument
that the angels are self-raised

00:47:56.869 --> 00:48:00.926
has something,
I think, like a foundation even

00:48:00.926 --> 00:48:04.221
in Book Five itself.
It begins to resemble that

00:48:04.221 --> 00:48:08.063
condition of absolute
self-determination that Raphael

00:48:08.063 --> 00:48:12.349
had promised to Adam and Eve if
they remained obedient.

00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:15.008
If Adam and Eve will only
remain sinless,

00:48:15.008 --> 00:48:18.398
they'll be able to raise
themselves to that ethereal

00:48:18.398 --> 00:48:21.777
state of angelic status.
This is a world in which

00:48:21.777 --> 00:48:25.255
individuals -- rational,
self-determining individuals --

00:48:25.255 --> 00:48:28.860
determine their own status
rather than accept one that has

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.389
been arbitrarily imposed upon
them.

00:48:31.389 --> 00:48:35.553
This is an egalitarian world
that Milton is introducing us

00:48:35.553 --> 00:48:39.059
to, and I think that in moments
such as these,

00:48:39.059 --> 00:48:43.741
we see Milton laboring to
arrive at a theory of matter and

00:48:43.741 --> 00:48:48.094
a theory of creation that can
support something like a

00:48:48.094 --> 00:48:50.188
poetics;
a poetics but also a

00:48:50.188 --> 00:48:53.179
philosophy, a political
philosophy of egalitarianism.

00:48:53.179 --> 00:48:57.174
To claim that matter can move
itself to organize itself into

00:48:57.174 --> 00:49:01.279
stars and into angels,
which is what Uriel will claim

00:49:01.279 --> 00:49:06.404
happens, is essentially to lay
the philosophical foundation for

00:49:06.404 --> 00:49:10.785
a political philosophy that's
not authoritarian by any

00:49:10.785 --> 00:49:13.431
stretch.
It's not even hierarchical:

00:49:13.431 --> 00:49:15.774
it's egalitarian.
This is a physics,

00:49:15.774 --> 00:49:19.586
a theological physics that can
bolster the claims of a

00:49:19.586 --> 00:49:22.337
politics.
It's a philosophy that can

00:49:22.337 --> 00:49:26.548
imagine human beings as being
equally capable of organizing

00:49:26.548 --> 00:49:30.831
themselves and creating their
own sense of order without the

00:49:30.831 --> 00:49:34.969
meddlesome intervention of an
arbitrary God.Now,

00:49:34.969 --> 00:49:39.421
many of my colleagues in the
Milton community dismiss the

00:49:39.421 --> 00:49:44.031
possibility that there could be
anything even remotely like

00:49:44.031 --> 00:49:48.880
something valid in Satan's
wonderful rejoinder to Abdiel.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.755
They nearly always overlook the
Creation account that we get

00:49:52.755 --> 00:49:56.368
from Uriel in Book Three,
which I think supports on some

00:49:56.368 --> 00:50:00.671
level part of Satan's claim.
They're also eager to dismiss

00:50:00.671 --> 00:50:04.619
Eve's feelings of injustice at
her inferior status.

00:50:04.619 --> 00:50:08.081
They dismiss it as just another
one of Milton's unquestioning

00:50:08.081 --> 00:50:11.889
acts of misogyny -- but I don't
think it's unquestioning at all.

00:50:11.889 --> 00:50:15.988
All three of these examples for
me demonstrate Milton's

00:50:15.988 --> 00:50:20.313
willingness to question nearly
every form of religious and

00:50:20.313 --> 00:50:25.649
social and political orthodoxy.
Milton is continually putting

00:50:25.649 --> 00:50:30.639
the official doctrines of even
his own poem on trial.

00:50:30.639 --> 00:50:34.520
He's continually pitting the
narrator's own celebration of

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.060
hierarchy -- Milton's own
celebration of hierarchy --

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:42.213
against a more subversive and a
more questioning philosophy of

00:50:42.213 --> 00:50:46.093
egalitarianism.Milton's
narrator -- and Milton is with

00:50:46.093 --> 00:50:50.178
him to some extent -- comes down
most firmly on the side of a

00:50:50.178 --> 00:50:55.808
divinely established hierarchy,
but this exquisitely textured,

00:50:55.808 --> 00:50:59.688
richly textured poem can be
distinguished,

00:50:59.688 --> 00:51:04.420
and in fact I think it has to
be distinguished,

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:11.030
from the views of the narrator.
On some incredibly important

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:14.559
level that's not on the level of
what the narrator tells us,

00:51:14.559 --> 00:51:18.349
the poem is itself insistently
egalitarian, and I mean that in

00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:21.145
a special sense:
it's egalitarian in the sense

00:51:21.145 --> 00:51:24.872
that it's a poem rather than a
dogmatic treatise or a work of

00:51:24.872 --> 00:51:28.239
political philosophy.
As a poem, Paradise Lost

00:51:28.239 --> 00:51:31.619
places all of its divergent
theories and all of its

00:51:31.619 --> 00:51:35.438
competing ideologies and visions
of the way the world works --

00:51:35.438 --> 00:51:39.256
places them all side by side on
something like a level playing

00:51:39.256 --> 00:51:42.717
field,
the playing field of the poetic

00:51:42.717 --> 00:51:45.275
line.
The poem connects these

00:51:45.275 --> 00:51:50.165
competing ideas with nothing
more leading than that most

00:51:50.165 --> 00:51:53.900
liberal of all conjunctions,
or.

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:58.460
This poem makes the reader the
equal of the poet because either

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:01.329
this is the case or that is the
case,

00:52:01.329 --> 00:52:04.420
and Milton is always telling us
to decide ourselves.

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:08.252
The poem lays down -- and I'll
conclude here -- a range of

00:52:08.252 --> 00:52:11.682
ideological possibilities,
and it does that from its

00:52:11.682 --> 00:52:14.170
opening line to its closing
line;

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:21.338
and then it permits the reader,
or maybe I should say it forces

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:28.159
the reader, to choose among
these possibilities.Okay.

00:52:28.159 --> 00:52:31.534
We're on a roll,
this is our big week:

00:52:31.534 --> 00:52:35.000
Books Seven and Eight for next
time.

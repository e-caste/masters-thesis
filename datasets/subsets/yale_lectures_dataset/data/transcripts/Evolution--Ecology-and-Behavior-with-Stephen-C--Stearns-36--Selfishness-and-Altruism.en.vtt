00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.182
Prof: Okay,
I think it's probably

00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:08.880
appropriate that the course
finishes on this note.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.859
These are some of the most
interesting and most nuanced and

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.219
deepest issues that we've
addressed in ecology and

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.092
evolution,
and they bring all these fields

00:00:19.092 --> 00:00:22.560
together: evolution,
ecology and behavior.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.990
So the outline of the lecture
is given here,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.763
and basically what I'm going to
tell you is that the initial

00:00:31.763 --> 00:00:35.344
idea on how altruism and
cooperation could evolve was kin

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:37.799
selection;
later alternatives were

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:41.800
proposed, and the current
situation is a bit more nuanced.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.407
We currently have pretty good
explanations for why unrelated

00:00:45.407 --> 00:00:47.120
individuals can cooperate.
 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.156
You've seen a bit of that
perhaps with the vampire bats,

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:54.900
and you'll see some more
examples in other cases.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.536
Now, this line of research was
really provoked by Darwin's

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:05.614
honest admission;
something that I think every

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:09.680
transparent and intellectually
honest scientist ought to do.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.869
He stated the conditions under
which he should be willing to

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.360
abandon his theory.
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.399
If ever it could be shown that
individuals repeatedly and

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.655
reliably sacrificed their own
fitness to increase the fitness

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:24.165
of others,
the theory of natural selection

00:01:24.165 --> 00:01:25.150
would be refuted.
 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.840
Well, naturally that attracted
attention.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.372
The logic is given here,
and the conclusion that one

00:01:35.372 --> 00:01:39.167
would come to from that is that
if you just take a simple-minded

00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:41.824
view,
mid-nineteenth century view,

00:01:41.824 --> 00:01:44.540
of the theory of natural
selection,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.310
altruism and cooperation should
be impossible.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.840
And an early alternative
explanation focused on group

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.423
selection, and the iconic
example there was the red grouse

00:01:58.423 --> 00:02:01.349
in Scotland;
it's a kind of ptarmigan.

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.513
And the group selection claim
was that they would curtail

00:02:05.513 --> 00:02:10.048
their reproduction to keep their
population from over-cropping

00:02:10.048 --> 00:02:14.137
the food supply and thereby
preserve the population as a

00:02:14.137 --> 00:02:15.030
whole.
 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.652
And so the issue was why
shouldn't an individual reduce

00:02:18.652 --> 00:02:19.658
reproduction?
 

00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:24.387
Why should one not reproduce
reproduction and thus avoid

00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:27.310
over-exploiting the food supply?
 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.988
And the problem is that if you
look at the decision made by any

00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:37.776
single individual,
it's benefiting the whole

00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:40.137
population,
but at the cost of its own

00:02:40.137 --> 00:02:40.800
offspring.
 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.050
Okay?
 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.998
And everybody benefits,
but the costs are paid by that

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:47.490
single individual.
 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.943
And so any selfish individual
who decided to defect,

00:02:50.943 --> 00:02:53.381
who wouldn't reduce its
reproduction,

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.598
would benefit.
 

00:02:54.598 --> 00:02:56.878
The others would cut back,
it would get more.

00:02:56.878 --> 00:03:00.824
And so group selected altruism,
as we've seen from evolutionary

00:03:00.824 --> 00:03:03.878
game theory, is not going to
invade when rare.

00:03:03.878 --> 00:03:07.269
It's not an evolutionarily
stable strategy,

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.870
and it doesn't resist invasion
by selfish alternatives.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.318
So the group selection
explanation is logically faulty.

00:03:17.318 --> 00:03:19.438
That doesn't mean that group
selection never works;

00:03:19.438 --> 00:03:23.240
we'll pretty soon state the
conditions under which it might,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.139
but it certainly doesn't work
in this case.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.740
So this is very similar to the
tragedy of the commons.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.048
And the reason that the red
grouse reduce their reproduction

00:03:34.048 --> 00:03:38.210
when the population is dense,
I think you already know.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.490
Can anybody tell me why?
 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.669
Population density goes up,
what happens to fertility,

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:44.270
and why?
 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.568
Yes?
 

00:03:48.568 --> 00:03:50.860
Student:
&gt;

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.580
Prof: Right, exactly.
 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.220
They have a very straight
physiological response to that.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.197
Population density goes up,
they have less to eat,

00:03:57.197 --> 00:03:58.530
they can't make as many babies.
 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.652
That's why the red grouse don't
make as many babies in the fall,

00:04:01.652 --> 00:04:03.188
when the population is dense.
 

00:04:03.188 --> 00:04:06.251
So let's go back to the basics,
to see what the critique of

00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:07.360
group selection is.
 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.550
Because this had to be worked
through before people could

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.490
really understand it and abandon
it and seek other alternatives.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.899
We're back to day one of the
course;

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.540
we're on the last day of the
course, we're going back to day

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:20.810
one.
 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.379
So if there's any selection
process going on,

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.242
its ability to produce change
is determined by how much

00:04:26.242 --> 00:04:28.680
variation in reproductive
success there is,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.199
among the things being selected;
by the correlation between the

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.016
trait under selection and the
variation in the success of the

00:04:35.016 --> 00:04:36.620
unit,
which would be in this case

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.625
either an individual or a group,
a whole population of red

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:41.754
grouse;
and the genetic variation of

00:04:41.754 --> 00:04:43.339
the trait among the units.
 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:49.360
Well let's just step through
all of those conditions.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.678
Usually the correlation between
a trait and reproductive success

00:04:52.678 --> 00:04:55.577
is much stronger for the
individual agents for the group

00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:58.160
than for the group in which
they're embedded.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.793
And you have to think of the
reproductive success of an

00:05:00.793 --> 00:05:02.600
individual as being its
offspring,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.112
and the reproductive success of
the group as being the number of

00:05:07.112 --> 00:05:09.189
groups that it might found.
 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:14.776
The variation in reproductive
success itself is greater among

00:05:14.776 --> 00:05:19.038
individuals than among groups,
usually, and that's

00:05:19.038 --> 00:05:20.937
primarily--I mean,
you can just see it

00:05:20.937 --> 00:05:21.449
statistically.
 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.464
You're taking--the reproductive
success of the group is going to

00:05:24.464 --> 00:05:27.288
depend upon the average of the
reproductive successes of the

00:05:27.288 --> 00:05:30.235
individuals in it,
and so normally the variation

00:05:30.235 --> 00:05:33.607
will be greater among the
individuals than it would be

00:05:33.607 --> 00:05:34.879
among the groups.
 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.889
The amount of genetic variation
in a trait that could be

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.117
accounted for by differences
among individuals is also a lot

00:05:41.117 --> 00:05:41.720
larger.
 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.458
So inter-individual variation
is usually much greater than

00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:45.660
variation among groups.
 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.973
We saw that,
by the way, when we did the

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:51.471
analysis of genetic variation
among ethnic groups and we saw

00:05:51.471 --> 00:05:55.149
that 85% of human genetic
variation is among individuals,

00:05:55.149 --> 00:06:00.370
and only about 15% is elsewhere.
 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.007
The generation time of
individuals is a lot shorter

00:06:03.007 --> 00:06:04.170
than that of groups.
 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.548
When you get into things like
species selection--remember,

00:06:06.548 --> 00:06:08.802
the average lifetime of a
species is one to ten million

00:06:08.802 --> 00:06:09.220
years.
 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.901
If you want to talk about
reducing the extinction rate of

00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:13.959
species on the basis of group
selection,

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:16.062
you've got a real problem,
because you only get a

00:06:16.062 --> 00:06:18.560
selection event once every
million years to once every ten

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.350
million years.
 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.048
So anything that's cranking
along at the level of the

00:06:21.048 --> 00:06:22.290
individual is going to happen
many,

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.896
many, many times before a
single event will happen at the

00:06:26.896 --> 00:06:28.459
level of a group.
 

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:31.661
And that is this final point,
which is the number of

00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:35.115
incidents of selection on
individuals, in any given unit

00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:37.879
of time, is normally much,
much greater.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:39.480
Okay?
 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.899
So it's the combination of
these six conditions that makes

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:48.783
it possible for a selfish mutant
to invade a resident population

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.420
of self-sacrificing altruists.
 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.490
So that's the more precise
analysis of why the original

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.091
nineteenth century Darwinian
theory said we expect

00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:03.910
individuals to be selfish.
 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.720
But look what we find.
 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.129
We find communal colonial
living, group hunting and

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:10.334
sharing food,
alarm calls,

00:07:10.334 --> 00:07:13.903
reproductive helpers;
you just saw three examples of

00:07:13.903 --> 00:07:15.399
them in the video.
 

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:18.569
And these are the leading
alternatives to group selection:

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:20.959
kin selection,
punishment, and mutualism.

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:25.110
So let's go through them.
 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.084
The basic idea of kin selection
I think you're already familiar

00:07:28.084 --> 00:07:28.420
with.
 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.543
It has interesting and
unsettling philosophical

00:07:32.543 --> 00:07:33.889
implications.
 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:37.509
If what matters isn't the
survival of the adult phenotype,

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:40.987
of the whole organism,
but an increase of frequency of

00:07:40.987 --> 00:07:43.480
genes that that individual
carries,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.339
then it will pay for that
individual to sacrifice itself

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:51.761
if more copies of its genes get
into the next generation than if

00:07:51.761 --> 00:07:54.850
the individual did not sacrifice
itself.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.463
So the costs and benefits have
to be weighed in genetic

00:07:58.463 --> 00:07:59.199
currency.
 

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:02.661
The genes are not only in it,
but they're also in its

00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:03.459
relatives.
 

00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:07.019
So if it can help its relatives
to survive and reproduce then--

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:10.427
and if the increase that it
gets by doing that is greater

00:08:10.427 --> 00:08:13.290
than the cost that it suffers by
doing that--

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.300
then that behavior will be
selected.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.081
So to formalize that,
just that the benefit is the

00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:24.319
increase in the relative's
fitness, as a result of the act.

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:27.220
The cost is the decrease in the
donor's fitness.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.089
R is the coefficient of
relationship.

00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:35.288
So you are .5 related to full
sibs, .5 related to mom,

00:08:35.288 --> 00:08:38.330
.5 related to offspring.
 

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.599
Then calculating out:
.125 to first cousins and

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:42.950
things like that.
 

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.058
That's what R is.
 

00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:48.386
And that is calculated as the
probability that a gene in the

00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:50.981
donor and a gene in the
recipient are so-called

00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:53.690
identical by descent from a
common ancestor.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.940
So R varies between 0 and 1.
 

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.019
Then the condition for helping
is that B divided by C is

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:04.581
greater than 1/R,
or the benefit times the degree

00:09:04.581 --> 00:09:07.918
of relationship is greater than
the cost.

00:09:07.918 --> 00:09:10.797
Or to put it into words,
the increase in the relative's

00:09:10.797 --> 00:09:14.283
fitness as a result of the act,
times the relationship to the

00:09:14.283 --> 00:09:16.730
relative--
right here--is greater than the

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.058
decrease in the donor's fitness
as a result of the act,

00:09:20.058 --> 00:09:21.669
times its relationship to
itself;

00:09:21.669 --> 00:09:23.309
which is 1.
 

00:09:23.309 --> 00:09:24.629
Okay?
 

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:29.296
So that is a very simple
inequality, and it's a very

00:09:29.296 --> 00:09:30.759
powerful idea.
 

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:34.090
This is the guy that had it;
this is Bill Hamilton.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.259
And Bill is a remarkable man.
 

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:39.149
He died in 2000,
after having--I think I've told

00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:41.216
you--
after having gone to the Congo

00:09:41.216 --> 00:09:44.328
to see whether or not AIDS got
into humans through a polio

00:09:44.328 --> 00:09:44.928
vaccine.
 

00:09:44.928 --> 00:09:49.570
And he was a very creative and
iconoclastic scientist;

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:54.859
certainly one of the major
minds in evolutionary biology in

00:09:54.859 --> 00:09:57.139
the last hundred years.
 

00:09:57.139 --> 00:10:01.032
Now some of the traits that
people think might be kin

00:10:01.032 --> 00:10:04.251
selected are alarm calls,
guarding behavior,

00:10:04.251 --> 00:10:08.220
helping at the nest,
and suppressed reproduction.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.519
By the way, if you printed out
the lecture,

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:14.129
I've taken out the two slides
on social hymenoptera,

00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:17.337
just to save a little time,
because I wanted a little more

00:10:17.337 --> 00:10:18.519
time for Sir David.
 

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:21.404
And I'm not really sure I'm
going to get through all of

00:10:21.404 --> 00:10:21.778
this.
 

00:10:21.778 --> 00:10:25.285
But these are the kinds of
things that people think can be

00:10:25.285 --> 00:10:27.070
explained by kin selection.
 

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.523
So one of the early ones was
the contrast between ground

00:10:30.523 --> 00:10:32.028
squirrels and marmots.
 

00:10:32.028 --> 00:10:35.509
And this is based on a
difference in their social

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:38.556
organization,
and in the probability that a

00:10:38.556 --> 00:10:41.529
given sex will be close to
relatives.

00:10:41.529 --> 00:10:44.000
So in the ground
squirrels--these guys live in

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.770
Yosemite--
the males wander off,

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.730
the females stay near their
burrow,

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.610
and it's the females who give
alarm calls,

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.019
and they usually do so when
offspring are threatened,

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:54.321
and sometimes they give alarm
calls when a niece is

00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:54.918
threatened.
 

00:10:54.918 --> 00:10:57.624
And that's because the females
don't move so far,

00:10:57.624 --> 00:11:00.666
and the daughters and nieces
and so forth are living in

00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:01.850
adjacent burrows.
 

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.120
So an adult female will watch
and will give the alarm call.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.690
It's quite different in marmots.
 

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.558
In marmots they hold harems.
 

00:11:08.558 --> 00:11:10.976
The male who is sitting on a
pile of rocks,

00:11:10.976 --> 00:11:14.315
with a bunch of females in it,
knows that all the babies in

00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:16.330
that pile of rocks are his own.
 

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.933
And so in this case it is the
male that is giving the alarm

00:11:20.933 --> 00:11:21.490
call.
 

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.645
And the contrast between the
two species--I think you can see

00:11:24.645 --> 00:11:27.330
some of the power of the
comparative method here.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.480
They're very similar in their
biology otherwise,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.919
but in one case the male gives
the call and in the other case

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:35.847
the female gives the call,
and the contrast tells you that

00:11:35.847 --> 00:11:39.176
it seems to be pretty tightly
associated with how close they

00:11:39.176 --> 00:11:41.149
are in space to their offspring.
 

00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:44.913
So you might want to consider
whether or not this evidence of

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:48.240
parental care really is evidence
of kin selection,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.470
or is it simply the act of the
individual completing

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.418
reproduction.
 

00:11:52.418 --> 00:11:53.769
So I'll leave that up in the
air.

00:11:53.769 --> 00:11:56.830
But this is some of the early
evidence that was used.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.345
Now perhaps a little bit more
convincing are helpers at the

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:00.769
nest.
 

00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:02.999
There are quite a few birds in
which there are helpers at the

00:12:02.999 --> 00:12:03.259
nest.
 

00:12:03.259 --> 00:12:05.586
Here are four of them;
so Pied Kingfisher,

00:12:05.586 --> 00:12:07.720
Florida Scrub Jay,
Acorn Woodpecker,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.610
and White-fronted Bee-eater.
 

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:15.227
We'll do the Pied Kingfisher
example, which was done by Ueli

00:12:15.227 --> 00:12:15.990
Reyer.
 

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:22.205
And he did this in East Africa,
contrasting colonies living on

00:12:22.205 --> 00:12:25.668
Lake Victoria and Lake Naivasha.
 

00:12:25.668 --> 00:12:30.225
So basically the reason he
contrasted them is that one of

00:12:30.225 --> 00:12:34.779
them has rough water and one of
them has smooth water.

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:37.510
And when the water is rough
it's harder to hunt and you need

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.567
more help to feed your babies,
and when the water is smooth

00:12:40.567 --> 00:12:43.730
it's easier to hunt and you
don't need so much help to feed

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:44.548
your babies.
 

00:12:44.548 --> 00:12:48.817
And indeed the percentage of
nests with no helpers was higher

00:12:48.817 --> 00:12:51.519
at Lake Naivasha,
with smooth water.

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:53.538
Primary helpers were not so
frequent.

00:12:53.538 --> 00:12:58.019
Primary and secondary helpers
were pretty rare;

00:12:58.019 --> 00:13:02.120
almost no secondary helpers at
all at Lake Naivasha.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.486
Primary helpers are older sibs
and secondary helpers are

00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:06.590
unrelated birds.
 

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:10.488
And these are the proportions
of encounters in which mated

00:13:10.488 --> 00:13:14.730
males are attacking or greeting
potential secondary helpers.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.460
So this relates for unrelated
birds coming into the nest.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.440
Do they attack them or greet
them?

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.750
And if you have two to three in
the nest,

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.730
they usually get attacked at
Lake Naivasha,

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.178
but if you have four or five
babies,

00:13:29.178 --> 00:13:32.370
and you really need help,
then they are greeted.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:38.080
And at Lake Victoria,
with two to three in the nest,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.782
they are greeted,
and if you have a reduced

00:13:42.782 --> 00:13:46.029
clutch they get attacked.
 

00:13:46.029 --> 00:13:49.220
So this was a case in which
there was a clutch manipulation.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.092
So basically if you need help
you greet helpers,

00:13:52.092 --> 00:13:55.090
and if you don't need help you
chase them away.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.844
And what's going on here is
that there's both degree of

00:13:58.844 --> 00:14:02.528
relationship for the primary
helpers who are sibs,

00:14:02.528 --> 00:14:06.740
but then there's also the issue
of can I get a nest site?

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.702
And why is it if I'm not
related to these guys am I

00:14:09.702 --> 00:14:10.830
helping them out?
 

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.320
And the answer is that the
helpers inherit the nest sites.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.808
So nesting is done in cliffs.
 

00:14:15.808 --> 00:14:18.070
There's not very much available
cliff habitat.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.110
They dig a meter-long burrow,
which is a lot of effort,

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.058
back into the cliff--so if you
can take one of these over,

00:14:24.058 --> 00:14:26.875
you don't have to dig it
yourself--and they lay their

00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:28.879
eggs way at the back of the
burrow.

00:14:28.879 --> 00:14:32.677
So there's an ecological
constraint on the system,

00:14:32.677 --> 00:14:36.629
and it's interacting with
degree of relationship.

00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:39.934
So overall, if you look at
total fitness of the different

00:14:39.934 --> 00:14:43.360
kinds of roles that are being
played in the population--

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.129
the breeding birds,
the primary helpers,

00:14:45.129 --> 00:14:47.928
the secondary helpers,
and those not helping--

00:14:47.928 --> 00:14:51.458
and you calculate both direct
fitness and indirect fitness

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:54.121
through relatives,
over the lifetime of the

00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:56.279
birds--so this takes years to
gather;

00:14:56.279 --> 00:14:59.274
this is a summary of a lot of
work--mating is better than

00:14:59.274 --> 00:14:59.809
helping.
 

00:14:59.809 --> 00:15:01.048
We see that here.
 

00:15:01.048 --> 00:15:04.046
Helping's better than not
helping, because it puts you in

00:15:04.046 --> 00:15:06.080
a position to inherit a nest
burrow.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.143
If you do help,
it's better to help a relative

00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:12.129
than a non-relative.
 

00:15:12.129 --> 00:15:15.495
And if you are a breeding bird,
you only should accept help if

00:15:15.495 --> 00:15:18.629
you really need it,
because the helpers might get a

00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:22.159
little frustrated and restless
and try to kick you out,

00:15:22.159 --> 00:15:24.808
so they can breed.
 

00:15:24.808 --> 00:15:29.941
Now in social carnivores the
situation is interesting because

00:15:29.941 --> 00:15:33.788
they are cases of reproductive
suppression.

00:15:33.788 --> 00:15:38.720
And in African hunting dogs,
in hyenas,

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.308
in mongooses,
there will usually be,

00:15:43.308 --> 00:15:46.083
in social mongooses,
there will be a social group

00:15:46.083 --> 00:15:48.792
that forages together,
and usually the dominant female

00:15:48.792 --> 00:15:49.730
does all the breeding.
 

00:15:53.298 --> 00:15:58.030
The group living brings with it
protection from things like

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.009
predators.
 

00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:07.631
And if I go back,
these guys are usually all

00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:11.592
related in a family,
but they do accept

00:16:11.592 --> 00:16:14.768
non-relatives;
the majority will be in a

00:16:14.768 --> 00:16:17.519
family but they will accept
non-relatives coming in.

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:21.813
And so kin selection is one of
the things that's going on in

00:16:21.813 --> 00:16:25.235
social carnivores,
and it's implying sacrificing

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:26.908
self for relatives.
 

00:16:26.908 --> 00:16:30.563
And when we ask what is the
best evidence for this

00:16:30.563 --> 00:16:33.918
gene-centered interpretation of
evolution,

00:16:33.918 --> 00:16:35.816
we see that wow,
there's some of it from kin

00:16:35.816 --> 00:16:37.808
selection,
and that does seem to work some

00:16:37.808 --> 00:16:39.807
of the time,
although often there are

00:16:39.807 --> 00:16:41.279
alternative explanations.
 

00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:45.086
But the really convincing
evidence that it is genes that

00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:48.269
are being operated on by natural
selection,

00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:50.695
and not individuals,
is the evolutionary theory of

00:16:50.695 --> 00:16:53.320
aging and all of the evidence
that now supports it;

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.009
which is extensive.
 

00:16:54.009 --> 00:16:56.510
And that is that the soma,
which is us,

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.065
is sacrificed for the germ
line, which is our offspring

00:17:00.065 --> 00:17:01.250
going forward.
 

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:06.825
And here we have lots of
experimental proof that this is

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.650
really the case.
 

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:09.289
Okay?
 

00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:14.666
It's been done now in possums,
fruit flies,

00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:17.098
worms, bacteria.
 

00:17:17.098 --> 00:17:21.818
So we have experimental
evolution confirming this idea.

00:17:21.818 --> 00:17:25.971
And therefore I would say that
overall this view,

00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:30.471
that genes really are what
evolution is operating on,

00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:32.980
is pretty well supported.
 

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.625
Now that doesn't mean that kin
selection is wrong,

00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:38.486
it just means we're more
certain that the evolutionary

00:17:38.486 --> 00:17:40.160
theory of aging is correct.
 

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.821
I would say that virtually
everyone in behavioral ecology

00:17:43.821 --> 00:17:47.548
today accepts that kin selection
is an important thing.

00:17:47.548 --> 00:17:50.393
I emphasize these points
because I actually lived through

00:17:50.393 --> 00:17:53.032
the period in science when these
were all alternative

00:17:53.032 --> 00:17:55.470
explanations and evidence was
accumulating,

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.667
and it was clear that things
like the comparison of the

00:17:58.667 --> 00:18:01.689
ground squirrels with the
marmots wasn't necessarily

00:18:01.689 --> 00:18:04.182
convincing evidence,
because there was the

00:18:04.182 --> 00:18:06.688
alternative that they were just
completing the act of

00:18:06.688 --> 00:18:07.460
reproduction.
 

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.470
Okay?
 

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.690
Since then I would say there
have been enough confirmations

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:17.346
of kin selection effects to make
us think that it's very probably

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:18.220
correct.
 

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.359
Okay.
 

00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:21.309
It does have some problems.
 

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.674
There are highly specialized
societies that have fine

00:18:27.674 --> 00:18:30.384
division of labor,
extensive cooperation,

00:18:30.384 --> 00:18:35.039
and the individuals in them are
no more closely related than are

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:37.700
individuals in simpler
societies.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.961
There has been a tendency to
over-estimate indirect fitness

00:18:41.961 --> 00:18:45.941
benefits;
so kin selected fitness

00:18:45.941 --> 00:18:47.318
benefits.
 

00:18:47.318 --> 00:18:51.269
And that has been done by
including direct descendants of

00:18:51.269 --> 00:18:53.638
the pair rather--
which could be,

00:18:53.638 --> 00:18:55.630
for example,
parental care--

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.369
rather than looking at nieces,
nephews,

00:18:59.369 --> 00:19:02.420
aunts, uncles, things like that.
 

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:07.118
The direct fitness benefits
have often been under-estimated.

00:19:07.118 --> 00:19:09.108
So there has been more or less
a tendency,

00:19:09.108 --> 00:19:10.880
once people learned about kin
selection,

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.904
to try to take the world and
fit it into that theoretical

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:17.806
construct,
and in the process people

00:19:17.806 --> 00:19:20.558
ignored some simpler
explanations.

00:19:20.558 --> 00:19:23.568
So if we want to explain social
living and cooperation,

00:19:23.568 --> 00:19:25.630
it might be good to take a look
at some of the alternatives,

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.630
because it doesn't look like
kin selection is going to do all

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.028
of it.
 

00:19:29.028 --> 00:19:32.284
And Tim Clutton-Brock has made
a career out of coming up with

00:19:32.284 --> 00:19:35.430
simple alternatives for current
bandwagon explanations,

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.618
and this paper here is one of
them.

00:19:38.618 --> 00:19:41.720
So let's take a look at social
carnivores.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.914
If the only possibility of
surviving at all is to be in a

00:19:46.914 --> 00:19:49.914
group,
and if that group's policed by

00:19:49.914 --> 00:19:53.883
a dominant female,
then she has the opportunity of

00:19:53.883 --> 00:19:58.605
telling subordinate females that
they've got to stay in the

00:19:58.605 --> 00:20:00.516
group,
even if they don't have

00:20:00.516 --> 00:20:01.900
offspring, and help her out.
 

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.954
Because even if it's going to
take them a long time to grow up

00:20:05.954 --> 00:20:09.576
and wait for her to die,
their chances of reproducing,

00:20:09.576 --> 00:20:12.316
by doing so,
are greater than if they left

00:20:12.316 --> 00:20:13.019
the group.
 

00:20:13.019 --> 00:20:16.903
I've been with the meerkats on
the border between South Africa

00:20:16.903 --> 00:20:17.858
and Botswana.
 

00:20:17.858 --> 00:20:19.720
They live--you saw the Cape
Cobra.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.634
There are also various
eagles--Batteleur Eagles and

00:20:22.634 --> 00:20:25.608
Harpy Eagles and things like
that--flying around.

00:20:25.608 --> 00:20:29.318
And I would say that the
expected survival time--

00:20:29.318 --> 00:20:32.066
not the reproductive success
but just the survival time of a

00:20:32.066 --> 00:20:34.770
meerkat that leaves a group--
is on the order probably of

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.921
about twenty-four hours;
maybe it might,

00:20:36.921 --> 00:20:40.848
a few might make it for a week,
but they're not going to make

00:20:40.848 --> 00:20:44.450
it for the months that they
would need to reproduce.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.672
So being in a group is so
important that even if the group

00:20:48.672 --> 00:20:52.818
is being policed by a big bully
it pays to stay in it.

00:20:52.818 --> 00:20:55.826
And if they do make a mistake
and they get pregnant and they

00:20:55.826 --> 00:20:57.608
have offspring,
she'll kill them.

00:20:57.608 --> 00:21:03.278
And they're only allowed to
stay in the group if they help.

00:21:03.278 --> 00:21:06.588
So what's running this system
basically is a combination of

00:21:06.588 --> 00:21:09.900
ecological constraint and
punishment, not kin selection.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:18.442
Now in a case where you have
tight interactions within a

00:21:18.442 --> 00:21:20.751
group,
and the success of everyone in

00:21:20.751 --> 00:21:23.288
the group depends upon the
degree of cooperation,

00:21:23.288 --> 00:21:27.980
then you can have cooperation
arising for reasons of win-win

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.251
kinds of interactions,
even if they're not related,

00:21:32.251 --> 00:21:37.060
and if the overall success of
the group can only be improved

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.299
by having the rising tide lifts
all boats effect.

00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:42.288
Okay?
 

00:21:42.288 --> 00:21:46.972
So there is also--this is
something else which is going on

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:51.036
with these social carnivores;
one could conceive of it like

00:21:51.036 --> 00:21:51.348
this.
 

00:21:51.348 --> 00:21:54.921
Group size increases the
capacity of group members to

00:21:54.921 --> 00:21:57.118
catch, produce or defend food.
 

00:21:57.118 --> 00:22:00.433
By the way, it also increases
their ability to detect and

00:22:00.433 --> 00:22:01.500
repel predators.
 

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.303
They can then,
when the group splits up and a

00:22:04.303 --> 00:22:08.126
reproductive module is moving
off--it could be five or ten of

00:22:08.126 --> 00:22:10.740
them, rather than one or two of
them;

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.569
so the offspring group is then
safer.

00:22:13.569 --> 00:22:16.230
They do better at raising young.
 

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.732
They do better at competing and
defending territories against

00:22:18.732 --> 00:22:19.358
other groups.
 

00:22:19.358 --> 00:22:22.255
And it has been noticed
that--by the way,

00:22:22.255 --> 00:22:26.090
this isn't just meerkats,
this is social carnivores in

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.960
general.
 

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.181
So individuals that live in
smaller groups have slower

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:29.808
growth rates.
 

00:22:29.808 --> 00:22:32.000
They have low survival,
low breeding success.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.269
Small groups frequently become
extinct.

00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:37.807
And it's thought that actually
individuals that are living in

00:22:37.807 --> 00:22:41.111
this social circumstance might
even advertise to solitary

00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:43.529
individuals wandering the
landscape,

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:45.788
"Hey, come and join us,
because if you come and join

00:22:45.788 --> 00:22:47.490
us, even though you're not
related to us,

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:51.618
then we will all do
better."

00:22:51.618 --> 00:22:55.936
So that gets us into reciprocal
altruism--okay?--and the

00:22:55.936 --> 00:23:00.882
conditions under which unrelated
individuals will cooperate with

00:23:00.882 --> 00:23:02.058
each other.
 

00:23:02.058 --> 00:23:04.368
The basic idea here is win-win
mutualism;

00:23:04.368 --> 00:23:08.140
you scratch my back,
I scratch yours.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:14.990
And so the payoff in equality
is really simple.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.742
If the benefit that I get from
engaging in this behavior is

00:23:17.742 --> 00:23:19.968
greater than the cost,
then I'm going to do it,

00:23:19.968 --> 00:23:22.750
and if it's the same for you,
then you're going to do it,

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.845
and if that is a cooperative
thing then we're both going to

00:23:25.845 --> 00:23:27.818
do it and we will get
cooperation.

00:23:27.818 --> 00:23:32.480
You'll notice that this is
basically selfish cooperation;

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.390
both individuals are gaining.
 

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:39.818
It works best if there are
repeated encounters between the

00:23:39.818 --> 00:23:40.828
two agents.
 

00:23:40.828 --> 00:23:45.124
You need to have--for
reciprocal altruism you need a

00:23:45.124 --> 00:23:48.828
cognitively fairly gifted kind
of species.

00:23:48.828 --> 00:23:49.013
Okay?
 

00:23:49.013 --> 00:23:50.118
It's got to have good memory.
 

00:23:50.118 --> 00:23:52.009
It's got to have individual
recognition.

00:23:52.009 --> 00:23:55.993
You need the spatial contiguity
that will result in the repeated

00:23:55.993 --> 00:23:56.880
interaction.
 

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.369
And the result is long-term
self-interest.

00:24:00.369 --> 00:24:01.578
Okay?
 

00:24:01.578 --> 00:24:05.509
And often this is coupled with
a disincentive to cheat.

00:24:05.509 --> 00:24:08.420
So you saw that with vampire
bats in the movie;

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:13.641
that if they remember that that
individual did not share blood

00:24:13.641 --> 00:24:18.348
with them when they needed it,
they won't share back.

00:24:18.348 --> 00:24:23.185
And this is very close to the
tit-for-tat strategy in the

00:24:23.185 --> 00:24:25.000
Prisoner's Dilemma.
 

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.809
So here are vampires again.
 

00:24:27.809 --> 00:24:30.088
And you saw the nice overview.
 

00:24:30.088 --> 00:24:34.220
So here is the hungry bat and
the satiated bat.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:38.355
And the hungry bat is more
likely to get fed if she has

00:24:38.355 --> 00:24:41.871
cooperated in the past;
so she's getting rewarded for

00:24:41.871 --> 00:24:42.700
that behavior.
 

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.156
And this is the kind of
cost-benefit analysis that

00:24:45.156 --> 00:24:45.808
they're on.
 

00:24:45.808 --> 00:24:48.747
This is the amount of
pre-feeding weight that they are

00:24:48.747 --> 00:24:51.170
losing over time;
which is interesting.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.929
You can see that they're losing
about oh, fifteen to twenty

00:24:53.929 --> 00:24:56.880
percent of their body weight per
day, if they're not eating.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.326
And you can see that the donor
is losing weight and time,

00:25:00.326 --> 00:25:03.220
and the recipient is gaining
weight and time.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.200
If it got down to here,
they would starve and die.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.204
So they are really daily kind
of balancing on a nutritional

00:25:10.204 --> 00:25:13.242
knife's edge,
and the cooperative behavior is

00:25:13.242 --> 00:25:16.420
making a life or death
difference to them.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.703
This is one of the few cases in
which a non-human species has

00:25:21.703 --> 00:25:26.019
been observed to engage in
reciprocal altruism.

00:25:26.019 --> 00:25:29.487
And I think that if you were to
go into the literature you would

00:25:29.487 --> 00:25:32.240
find that some people think that
they actually,

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.914
the donor and the recipient,
might be related a bit more

00:25:34.914 --> 00:25:36.568
frequently than one had thought.
 

00:25:36.568 --> 00:25:41.180
So there may also be a kin
selection element to this.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:48.525
So helping behavior can be
explained in a number of

00:25:48.525 --> 00:25:51.608
different contexts.
 

00:25:51.608 --> 00:25:54.300
There's straight out
manipulation,

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:59.112
which benefits the person who
is doing- the individual doing

00:25:59.112 --> 00:26:03.190
the manipulating,
and it's bad for the helper.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:07.667
So, in fact,
you should think of those

00:26:07.667 --> 00:26:13.961
social mongoose nurses,
who are sitting there waiting

00:26:13.961 --> 00:26:19.410
to reproduce,
as basically paying a cost.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.242
They are getting some indirect
fitness benefit probably,

00:26:23.242 --> 00:26:26.588
because they're probably
nursing their nieces.

00:26:26.588 --> 00:26:27.046
Okay?
 

00:26:27.046 --> 00:26:30.970
So they are getting some
benefit that way.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.747
But they'd be doing a lot
better if they were the dominant

00:26:34.747 --> 00:26:35.940
breeding female.
 

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.913
In a mutualistic encounter,
as with the vampire bats,

00:26:40.913 --> 00:26:46.460
there is a positive benefit for
both in the interaction.

00:26:50.348 --> 00:26:54.910
The long-term reciprocal
interaction is a case of

00:26:54.910 --> 00:27:00.798
mutualism, but the short-term
reciprocal interaction is not.

00:27:00.798 --> 00:27:03.938
The short-term interaction is
very much like the Prisoner's

00:27:03.938 --> 00:27:04.480
Dilemma.
 

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.440
If those two vampire bats were
only going to encounter each

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.349
other once in their lives,
there wouldn't be any incentive

00:27:10.349 --> 00:27:13.390
to give the other blood;
the life would not be saved;

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:19.440
and the behavior would not be
selected.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.372
With kin selection the effect
on direct fitness--direct

00:27:22.372 --> 00:27:24.490
fitness is direct individual
fitness;

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:27.460
okay, indirect fitness is
fitness through relatives.

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:35.516
In kin selection the
beneficiary gains and the donor

00:27:35.516 --> 00:27:36.779
loses.
 

00:27:36.779 --> 00:27:41.181
So there is actually a cost in
terms of numbers of children per

00:27:41.181 --> 00:27:44.517
lifetime, or numbers of
grandchildren in the kin

00:27:44.517 --> 00:27:46.150
selection scenario.
 

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.990
With Belding's ground
squirrels, or with marmots,

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:54.588
the cost should be conceived of
as the cost of drawing attention

00:27:54.588 --> 00:27:58.750
to oneself when one gives an
alarm call when a predator is

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.728
swooping in;
so that in fact the probability

00:28:01.728 --> 00:28:05.286
of dying in a predatory attack
is greater if you give an alarm

00:28:05.286 --> 00:28:07.618
call, or if you're on guard
behavior.

00:28:07.618 --> 00:28:10.577
And, of course,
evolution has acted to increase

00:28:10.577 --> 00:28:14.114
the speed and intelligence of
these animals so that they

00:28:14.114 --> 00:28:16.430
reduce those costs to a minimum.
 

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:20.516
But that, in principle,
is the source of this minus

00:28:20.516 --> 00:28:22.068
sign, right here.
 

00:28:22.068 --> 00:28:25.522
So to summarize the
explanations for cooperative

00:28:25.522 --> 00:28:30.032
behavior and altruism,
it is now widely accepted that

00:28:30.032 --> 00:28:35.209
kin selection does occur,
and it can explain altruistic

00:28:35.209 --> 00:28:36.259
sacrifice.
 

00:28:36.259 --> 00:28:40.046
A lot of people have seen it as
the biggest deal in evolutionary

00:28:40.046 --> 00:28:42.150
biology in the twentieth
century;

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:45.859
at least among people who are
concerned with behavior and the

00:28:45.859 --> 00:28:48.890
evolution of intelligence and
things like that.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.316
But the number of cases in
which kin selection has really

00:28:52.316 --> 00:28:54.928
been pushed to the limit,
and tested against

00:28:54.928 --> 00:28:56.824
alternatives,
is a lot smaller than the

00:28:56.824 --> 00:28:59.170
number of cases in which it's
been proposed.

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:03.123
So there was a bandwagon
effect, and people went out and

00:29:03.123 --> 00:29:07.507
placed this theory on the world,
and then tried to cram Nature

00:29:07.507 --> 00:29:08.368
into it.
 

00:29:08.368 --> 00:29:13.278
And the fact that they didn't
doesn't mean that it's false,

00:29:13.278 --> 00:29:16.993
it just means that not all of
the cases that were advanced

00:29:16.993 --> 00:29:19.210
were truly logically convincing.
 

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.936
So the main alternatives to kin
selection are long-term

00:29:22.936 --> 00:29:26.181
individual self-interest,
and this would include

00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:29.150
punishment and reactions to
punishment.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:34.214
And we've seen this kind of
thing, both with the vampire

00:29:34.214 --> 00:29:38.818
bats and with the social
mongooses and meerkats;

00:29:38.818 --> 00:29:41.788
meerkats, by the way,
are also a kind of social

00:29:41.788 --> 00:29:42.500
mongoose.
 

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.230
And that is really a very
strong direct effect,

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:48.355
and it's quite measurable,
and it's stronger in terms of

00:29:48.355 --> 00:29:51.824
effects on reproductive success
than the weaker effects of kin

00:29:51.824 --> 00:29:52.618
selection.
 

00:29:52.618 --> 00:29:55.838
And then there is win-win
mutualistic cooperation;

00:29:55.838 --> 00:29:58.450
and we haven't really gone into
that in detail.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:04.117
But there are quite a few cases
out there where organisms from

00:30:04.117 --> 00:30:08.086
different species,
which by definition are not

00:30:08.086 --> 00:30:11.150
related to each other very much
at all,

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:16.739
are creating a mutualistic
interaction which benefits both

00:30:16.739 --> 00:30:17.720
of them.
 

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:23.188
And not every symbiosis is that
way, but there are certainly

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:27.730
some cases in which this is a
win-win for both.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.210
Okay.
 

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.630
So I'm going to have a review
session tonight,

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.339
in here at 7:00,
and I'm going to hold another

00:30:35.339 --> 00:30:37.868
review session on Sunday night
at 7:00,

00:30:37.868 --> 00:30:40.309
because I know some of you have
conflicts tonight,

00:30:40.309 --> 00:30:42.029
for various reasons.
 

00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:46.509
And remember these,
especially the May 4^(th)

00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:47.630
deadline.
 

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:49.440
That's the one that we can't
bend.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.160
That's the one where you need a
Dean's Excuse if you're going to

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.400
go past that point.
 

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.650
So it's been fun.
 

00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:58.319
Thank you all.
 

00:30:58.319 --> 00:30:59.240
See some of you tonight.
 

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:05.380

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.752
Prof: Today we're going
to talk about developmental

00:00:04.752 --> 00:00:08.936
plasticity and reaction norms,
and in the process we are going

00:00:08.936 --> 00:00:13.301
to complete our assemblage of
all of the tools we need to

00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:19.370
understand microevolution,
at least as a first sketch.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.293
You'll recall that last time we
were discussing developmental

00:00:24.293 --> 00:00:29.299
control genes and the way they
lay down basic patterns in body

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:30.120
plans.
 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.254
They provide insight into the
deep history of developmental

00:00:37.254 --> 00:00:42.420
constraint and phylogenetic
constraint,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.170
and they also set up patterns
that then interact,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.691
during the course of
development of individual

00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:54.195
organisms,
interact with the environment

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:57.440
to determine what the phenotype
actually looks like.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.773
The main thing that I'll be
talking about today is the

00:01:00.773 --> 00:01:05.322
concept of a reaction norm,
and in so doing I would like to

00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:10.132
fundamentally alter the way that
you probably think about

00:01:10.132 --> 00:01:11.250
organisms.
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.363
I want you to think about
organisms, or about genomes at

00:01:15.363 --> 00:01:19.477
least, as having the potential
to produce many different

00:01:19.477 --> 00:01:20.299
things.
 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.473
The actual thing that is
realized depends upon the

00:01:23.473 --> 00:01:26.000
particular environments
encountered,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.030
the particular history of that
individual organism,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.060
and this can have profound
effects on the way it looks,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.349
the way it behaves,
and how long it lives.

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:41.336
So this completes our basic
understanding of all of the

00:01:41.336 --> 00:01:46.970
fundamental processes that are
operating in microevolution.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.766
And after this point we're
going to go on to discuss major

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:54.867
features of phenotypes,
and on Monday we'll discuss the

00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:57.735
evolution of sex,
and we'll go on to discuss

00:01:57.735 --> 00:01:59.750
things like life history
evolution,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.498
sex allocation,
and genetic conflict:

00:02:05.498 --> 00:02:10.449
all of those sorts of things.
 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.490
So today I'm going to define a
reaction norm.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.699
I'll tell you where it fits in
the evolutionary process;

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:22.068
where it came from;
how it interacts with genetics;

00:02:22.068 --> 00:02:25.258
how you can actually visualize
the simultaneous effects of

00:02:25.258 --> 00:02:28.280
genes and environment by making
reaction norm plots.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.378
That's an important thing.
 

00:02:30.378 --> 00:02:33.351
There's been a long controversy
in our general culture about

00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:34.560
Nature versus Nurture.
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.054
Today I'm giving you the tool
to take that issue apart and

00:02:38.054 --> 00:02:39.710
understand it rigorously.
 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.756
You will end up seeing that all
aspects of all organisms are

00:02:43.756 --> 00:02:48.078
determined both by genes and by
environment, and there are clear

00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:49.930
ways to think about it.
 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.190
Then I'll show you how this
kind of immediate,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.741
short-term phenotypic
plasticity interacts with

00:02:56.741 --> 00:03:00.068
developmental control genes and
phylogenetic constraints,

00:03:00.068 --> 00:03:03.020
and I'll do that with the
butterfly wing,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:11.658
and we will see at the end that
in fact biology is--

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:14.697
heh, it's not
surprising--biology is complexly

00:03:14.697 --> 00:03:16.546
organic,
in a very deep way,

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:19.520
and we can see that in the
butterfly wing example.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.729
So, this is what a reaction
norm is.

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:25.949
Okay?
 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.009
It's a property of a genotype.
 

00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:34.210
One can also define reaction
norms for larger collections of

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.680
things.
 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.700
You can define a reaction norm
for a family,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.360
for example.
 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.056
All the sibs in a family might
share a certain component of

00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:41.729
their reaction to the
environment.

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:45.140
But strictly speaking,
a reaction norm is just the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.370
property of a single genotype.
 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.485
So what it does is describe the
set of phenotypes into which one

00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:56.710
genotype can be mapped,
as the environment varies.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.741
So in the simplest case you
have one trait and you have one

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:03.433
environmental variable,
and this is the way that that

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:05.135
genotype,
one genotype,

00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:08.150
would react to this one
environmental variable.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.310
Now, organisms have lots of
traits,

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.300
and there are lots of
environmental variables,

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.297
and so you can immediately see
that this simple picture can be

00:04:20.297 --> 00:04:23.769
generalized into an
N-dimensional reaction surface.

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:27.322
It can get very complex if
we're not just dealing about

00:04:27.322 --> 00:04:29.351
temperature,
but say food,

00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:33.276
population density,
presence or absence of members

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:36.610
of the other sex,
many things.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.403
And we think about that
happening over the whole course

00:04:40.403 --> 00:04:43.882
of the organism's life;
you can generate quite a

00:04:43.882 --> 00:04:45.750
complex reaction surface.
 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.654
So each genotype has the
potential to end up anywhere

00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:53.107
along this reaction surface,
depending upon the

00:04:53.107 --> 00:04:55.060
environmental history.
 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.348
So the study of reaction norms
is intended to make that process

00:04:59.348 --> 00:05:00.110
explicit.
 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.329
Now where's it fit?
 

00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:11.391
In the last lecture I gave you
one slide that had on it,

00:05:11.391 --> 00:05:14.910
"This is what ecology and
behavior do;

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.086
this is what genetics does;
this is what development does,

00:05:18.086 --> 00:05:19.269
in evolution."
 

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:23.074
I am now repeating that slide,
that basic message,

00:05:23.074 --> 00:05:25.250
in a diagrammatic context.
 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.579
Okay?
 

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:31.300
So we can think of the
evolutionary process basically

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.113
as being a cycle that moves
between genotype space and

00:05:36.113 --> 00:05:37.930
phenotype space.
 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.190
So this is one generation,
this is another generation.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.839
And reaction norms develop at
the stage where the genotypes

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:51.250
that are present in the just
fertilized zygote are being

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.180
translated into the phenotypes
of the adults.

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:04.216
When the gametes are then
mapped into genotypes,

00:06:04.216 --> 00:06:07.745
to produce this array here--so
when the zygotes are

00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:10.778
formed--this is the
Hardy-Weinberg Law;

00:06:10.778 --> 00:06:13.778
this is basically population
genetics up here.

00:06:13.778 --> 00:06:17.658
Down here, when the phenotypes
that are being produced by the

00:06:17.658 --> 00:06:20.891
reaction norms then undergo
behavior and ecology to

00:06:20.891 --> 00:06:24.446
determine a surviving set of
organisms that can mate and

00:06:24.446 --> 00:06:28.815
reproduce and have babies,
that's natural selection,

00:06:28.815 --> 00:06:29.800
down here.
 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.973
Now the important thing is that
all of these things go on in

00:06:34.973 --> 00:06:36.639
every generation.
 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.230
You can't get away from any of
them.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.343
In every generation there's
genetics, in every generation

00:06:43.343 --> 00:06:46.178
there's development,
and in every generation there's

00:06:46.178 --> 00:06:47.569
ecology and behavior.
 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.783
So they're all necessary
components of understanding the

00:06:51.783 --> 00:06:53.930
microevolutionary process.
 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.230
This is the first picture ever
made of a reaction norm.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.653
It was done by a German guy
named Woltereck,

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:04.471
working in lakes near Munich,
and so he called them

00:07:04.471 --> 00:07:07.120
reaktionsnormen,
not reaction norms.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.449
And what you see here are the
morphological changes that are

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:16.153
going on between generations--
so this is a mother,

00:07:16.153 --> 00:07:18.507
this is her offspring,
this is the offspring of this

00:07:18.507 --> 00:07:22.220
one, and so forth--
within a single clone.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.660
These are water fleas that are
reproducing asexually.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.026
So what you're looking at is a
series of different phenotypes

00:07:28.026 --> 00:07:30.610
that are all produced by the
same genotype,

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.819
the genotype is being copied
exactly,

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:36.235
and in the middle of the summer
they are producing these helmets

00:07:36.235 --> 00:07:36.940
and spines.
 

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:44.252
There are a number of cases
that are pretty well studied

00:07:44.252 --> 00:07:45.769
where this happens.
 

00:07:45.769 --> 00:07:47.971
There are spines,
helmets and neck teeth in these

00:07:47.971 --> 00:07:50.235
water fleas,
which are called Daphnia,

00:07:50.235 --> 00:07:53.449
and they are induced by
dissolved molecules that are

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:57.069
associated with predators,
and the predator's efficiency

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:00.350
in eating those Daphnia is
affected by the production of

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.769
those spines and helmets,
on the Daphnia.

00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:09.060
Making a spine or a helmet has
a reproductive cost.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.187
So if the predator's not
around, you don't want to make

00:08:11.187 --> 00:08:12.959
the spine, because it's costing
you babies.

00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:19.250
So it is a contingent plastic
reaction.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.444
You get a signal from the
environment that says,

00:08:21.444 --> 00:08:22.519
"Oh, oh,
danger.

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:23.860
What do I do?"
 

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.476
Well basically what you do is
you modify the development of

00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:31.660
your offspring so that they're
safer,

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.773
but your offspring won't be
able to have as many babies

00:08:34.773 --> 00:08:37.308
because they're better at not
being eaten.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:40.222
There are bent shells in
barnacles that do the same

00:08:40.222 --> 00:08:42.109
thing;
they make them resistant to

00:08:42.109 --> 00:08:44.525
snail predators,
but they reduce the barnacle's

00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:45.210
fecundity.
 

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.129
This cost is important.
 

00:08:47.129 --> 00:08:50.577
If the cost were not there,
then the organisms would make

00:08:50.577 --> 00:08:52.980
the defensive structure all the
time.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.600
If it was cost-free,
why not do it all the time?

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.850
Okay?
 

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.038
But it's not,
it cost them something,

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.788
and so they're forced to
compromise,

00:09:00.788 --> 00:09:04.013
and they try to minimize the
cost of the defensive structures

00:09:04.013 --> 00:09:07.129
by not producing them unless
they get a signal that there's

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:07.720
danger.
 

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:14.017
Snails parasitized by
castrating digenetic trematodes

00:09:14.017 --> 00:09:15.269
reproduce earlier.
 

00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:18.188
By the way, this digenetic
trematode is also called

00:09:18.188 --> 00:09:19.240
schistosomiasis.
 

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.216
So this snail is an
intermediate host for a serious

00:09:23.216 --> 00:09:24.490
human disease.
 

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.139
Let's take a look at these.
 

00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:30.538
When Daphnia smell midge
larvae, in the water--

00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:33.770
a midge larva is a little
invertebrate predator that swims

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.720
around and it catches Daphnia
with its fore legs,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.750
like this, and if Daphnia makes
a little neck tooth,

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.070
it makes it harder for the
midge larvae to handle it.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.340
Evidently this neck tooth
actually,

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.830
although it looks very small,
cost Daphnia something,

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.346
because they only make it when
they smell midge larvae in the

00:09:52.346 --> 00:09:52.950
water.
 

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.841
This is a modern photograph of
the helmet and the tail spine on

00:09:57.841 --> 00:09:58.629
Daphnia.
 

00:09:58.629 --> 00:10:00.980
You can see they're really
quite dramatic.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.629
And this is where the cost is
borne, here.

00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:05.740
You can see the number of eggs
being produced,

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.552
and there are fewer eggs in the
body of this Daphnia than there

00:10:08.552 --> 00:10:10.460
would be in a mature member of
this one.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.923
This one has actually just
given birth, so its eggs are all

00:10:14.923 --> 00:10:16.308
out of its body.
 

00:10:16.308 --> 00:10:18.278
In barnacles this is what it
looks like.

00:10:18.278 --> 00:10:22.596
If the barnacle smells the
snails, when it's growing up,

00:10:22.596 --> 00:10:25.500
it grows up in a clumped-over
form.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.880
It bends as it grows,
and instead of feeding freely

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.477
out of the top of its body,
it feeds very inefficiently,

00:10:33.477 --> 00:10:38.889
and it pays a price in not
being able to make more babies.

00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:41.460
Barnacles, by the way,
are essentially shrimp that

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.658
swim around as larvae and glue
themselves to the substrate and

00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:47.019
spend their lives stuck to the
basement,

00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:49.418
kicking food into their mouth
with their feet.

00:10:49.418 --> 00:10:56.668
So the feet of the barnacle
would be sticking out here.

00:10:56.668 --> 00:11:00.735
Charles Darwin spent seven
years working on barnacles,

00:11:00.735 --> 00:11:04.649
figuring out that they were
actually crustaceans.

00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:07.500
This is the data on
schistosomiasis,

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.634
and the neat thing about this
experiment is that the reaction

00:11:12.634 --> 00:11:17.855
in the snail is induced just by
water in which there have been

00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:21.000
parasites,
not by the parasites themselves.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.244
In other words,
you just give the snail a

00:11:23.244 --> 00:11:25.490
whiff,
a little bit of scent that a

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.100
parasite is likely to get into
its body,

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.830
and its reaction is,
"Oh gosh,

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.595
I am going to die from a
parasite, so I better start

00:11:33.595 --> 00:11:34.678
reproducing."
 

00:11:34.678 --> 00:11:37.580
So it shifts its reproduction
earlier in life;

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.019
and you can see the extent of
that shift right here.

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:42.240
These are the ones that have
been exposed to water with

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.945
parasites in it;
these are the unexposed

00:11:44.945 --> 00:11:45.798
controls.
 

00:11:45.798 --> 00:11:48.529
So these things that I'm
describing are all induced

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:51.251
responses,
they are all plastic reactions

00:11:51.251 --> 00:11:55.336
to signals in the environment,
and they all shape the reaction

00:11:55.336 --> 00:11:56.960
norms of these organisms.
 

00:12:00.298 --> 00:12:02.250
So those are some concrete
cases.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.630
Now let's look at sort of the
abstract, visual,

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.870
analytic framework a little
bit.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.149
Here is one reaction norm.
 

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:16.302
I have sketched a common one
for many poikilothermic

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:18.860
organisms;
many things that are--you would

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.583
think of them as cold-blooded;
they don't regulate their body

00:12:21.583 --> 00:12:22.080
temperature.
 

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.783
The higher the temperature,
the smaller they are at

00:12:25.783 --> 00:12:26.600
maturity.
 

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.001
That would work--this general
relationship describes how

00:12:30.001 --> 00:12:32.230
tadpoles grow,
how many fish grow.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:38.674
If you look at a population,
it can be conceived of as a

00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:41.840
bundle of reaction norms.
 

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.120
So there are many genotypes out
there.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.914
So if we have a very small
population with just about five

00:12:46.914 --> 00:12:49.870
or six genotypes in it--
the green dotted lines are the

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.009
individual reaction norms for
the different genotypes,

00:12:53.009 --> 00:12:55.850
and there could be a population
mean reaction norm.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.422
You just calculate the mean
value across all the

00:12:58.422 --> 00:13:01.322
environments and all the
genotypes, and that describes

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:03.129
how that population responds.
 

00:13:03.129 --> 00:13:06.201
This is important when you're
trying to summarize this kind of

00:13:06.201 --> 00:13:07.408
complexity in ecology.
 

00:13:07.408 --> 00:13:10.394
You want to know how one
population might react as the

00:13:10.394 --> 00:13:13.426
environment changes,
so that you can analyze its

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:16.769
impact on another one:
a predator acting on a prey;

00:13:16.769 --> 00:13:22.990
a parasite acting on a host;
a grazer acting on a plant.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.846
This is a good picture to have
in your mind of what that

00:13:26.846 --> 00:13:28.528
population looks like.
 

00:13:28.528 --> 00:13:31.850
Now traits can have very
different expression patterns;

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.655
it's not as though all traits
have very dramatic reaction

00:13:35.655 --> 00:13:36.200
norms.
 

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.500
And I just chose the example of
five digits in many tetrapods,

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.191
including ourselves,
to indicate that you could have

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:49.511
three different genotypes,
and you could change population

00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:52.015
density a lot,
and the number of digits on the

00:13:52.015 --> 00:13:52.980
hand wouldn't change.
 

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.408
Everybody would have five
fingers.

00:13:54.408 --> 00:13:57.246
There are some things that are
just not sensitive to the

00:13:57.246 --> 00:13:57.970
environment.
 

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.158
Okay?
 

00:13:59.158 --> 00:14:02.687
So think of the individual
organism as a mosaic of

00:14:02.687 --> 00:14:03.840
sensitivities.
 

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.081
Some of it is not sensitive at
all to changes in the

00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:10.452
environment, or almost
insensitive, and other parts of

00:14:10.452 --> 00:14:12.169
it are quite sensitive.
 

00:14:12.169 --> 00:14:14.190
For example, fecundity.
 

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.957
If you increase population
density, fecundity will go down

00:14:18.957 --> 00:14:23.056
in individual organisms,
because they're having to

00:14:23.056 --> 00:14:25.649
compete harder to get food.
 

00:14:25.649 --> 00:14:30.450
So if you restrict food,
by any mechanism,

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.200
fecundity will drop--and an
increase in population density

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.172
is one way to do it--
and the genotypes in the

00:14:36.172 --> 00:14:40.129
population can react differently
to that increase.

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:43.873
In all three cases fecundity
decreased, but genotype 1 was

00:14:43.873 --> 00:14:46.761
quite sensitive,
and genotype 3 was much less

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:49.980
sensitive to the shift in
population density;

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.740
and that makes a difference.
 

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.168
As a matter of fact,
if you think about it,

00:14:53.168 --> 00:14:56.320
right here, if you have a
fluctuating population,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.844
and this population is going
between low density and high

00:14:58.844 --> 00:15:00.307
density,
you have a method of

00:15:00.307 --> 00:15:02.440
maintaining genetic variation
right there,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.943
because the reaction norms
cross, and the guys that were

00:15:06.943 --> 00:15:10.629
good at one density are lousy at
the other.

00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:14.918
So if the population cycles
back and forth between them,

00:15:14.918 --> 00:15:18.894
one time G1 is favored,
the next time G3 is favored,

00:15:18.894 --> 00:15:20.220
and so forth.
 

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.320
Okay?
 

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:26.043
So I'm trying to develop the
notion that by sketching

00:15:26.043 --> 00:15:29.336
reaction norms,
you can come up,

00:15:29.336 --> 00:15:33.167
very quickly,
with a useful analytical

00:15:33.167 --> 00:15:37.928
picture of what's going on in a
population.

00:15:37.928 --> 00:15:40.061
For example,
if you have this sort of a

00:15:40.061 --> 00:15:42.529
reaction norm pattern for four
genotypes,

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:46.556
and you select upward here,
you're going to lead to no

00:15:46.556 --> 00:15:50.105
response over here at all,
because they all happen to

00:15:50.105 --> 00:15:51.350
converge at this point.
 

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.350
So selection here doesn't make
any difference to what you

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.600
observe in this part of the
environment.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.705
But in this case,
the crossing reaction norm case

00:15:59.705 --> 00:16:02.940
that we had in the last picture
with fecundity,

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.889
if you select upward in this
environment,

00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:10.519
you're going to have a downward
response here.

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:13.278
If we select at low population
density,

00:16:13.278 --> 00:16:16.360
and population density is low
for a long time,

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.558
it's going to produce a shift
in the population over here,

00:16:19.558 --> 00:16:22.673
because G1 will be favored,
and it has low fecundity at

00:16:22.673 --> 00:16:23.539
high density.
 

00:16:23.539 --> 00:16:24.389
Okay?
 

00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:26.370
That's this situation.
 

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:30.631
We can just look at a sketch of
a reaction norm and we get a

00:16:30.631 --> 00:16:34.533
sense for how sensitive that
trait is to changes in the

00:16:34.533 --> 00:16:35.690
environment.
 

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.005
This is not a very plastic
trait, it's pretty insensitive,

00:16:39.005 --> 00:16:42.090
and we can see that because it
has a shallow slope.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.100
This trait's very sensitive.
 

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.070
You change the environment a
little, it changes a lot.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:54.480
Now it's not just spines and
helmets that have reaction

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.580
norms.
 

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.466
This is a picture of an
Affymetrix GeneChip for

00:16:59.466 --> 00:17:04.173
Drosophila melanogaster--
it's got 13,500 genes--and what

00:17:04.173 --> 00:17:08.630
the chip is doing is it's
picking up the messenger RNA,

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.380
which is being expressed in the
organism;

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.750
and the intensity of light that
you see at a given spot is a

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.777
measure of the concentration of
messenger RNA for that

00:17:17.777 --> 00:17:18.920
particular gene.
 

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.428
So in one picture you have a
summary view of the output of

00:17:23.428 --> 00:17:25.009
the entire genome.
 

00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:26.710
Okay?
 

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.799
These things have reaction
norms.

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:30.410
I put this in for Andrea.
 

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.380
Okay?
 

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.279
Andrea just wrote a paper about
this.

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:35.380
So these things have reaction
norms.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.570
If I gave you Drosophila and I
exposed them to high temperature

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.607
and low temperature and you
extracted their mRNA and you ran

00:17:41.607 --> 00:17:44.798
them out on a GeneChip and you
compared the two patterns,

00:17:44.798 --> 00:17:50.102
you would see big differences
in the patterns of all of those

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:51.338
light spots.
 

00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:55.404
And if you did that carefully,
you would be able to draw the

00:17:55.404 --> 00:17:59.125
reactions of the expression
patterns for all the 13,500

00:17:59.125 --> 00:18:00.779
genes in the genome.
 

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:04.380
So these concepts are general.
 

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.230
They're not limited to
morphology.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.810
They apply to any aspect of the
phenotype, and this is now a

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.299
very popular way to measure
phenotypes.

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:14.230
Okay?
 

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.798
There are lots of things like
GeneChips out there.

00:18:16.798 --> 00:18:21.818
How many people in the audience
know, or have heard of

00:18:21.818 --> 00:18:26.650
GeneChips, or other methods of
measuring outputs?

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.253
You're not quite densely
scattered enough to have you

00:18:29.253 --> 00:18:32.059
turn to everyone around you and
explain what they are.

00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:32.990
&gt;
 

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.468
If I had about twice the
density, I could just stop

00:18:35.468 --> 00:18:38.491
talking and have you all explain
to each other what a GeneChip

00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:38.839
is.
 

00:18:38.839 --> 00:18:40.240
Okay.
 

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.390
We can leave that for a later
date.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.892
Suffice it to say that in
modern molecular technology

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:49.480
these things,
which are now just about ten

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.797
years old,
a little over ten years old,

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:55.310
are methods of looking at the
expression of all the genes in

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:59.278
the genome all at once;
and they too have reaction

00:18:59.278 --> 00:18:59.930
norms.
 

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.630
So to sum up on reaction norms.
 

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:10.940
A reaction norm is a
description of how genes are

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:17.548
mapped into the phenotype as a
function of the environment.

00:19:17.548 --> 00:19:19.690
They are properties of
genotypes.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.332
So if you really want a proper,
rigorous way of measuring a

00:19:23.332 --> 00:19:25.891
reaction norm,
you have to be able to clone

00:19:25.891 --> 00:19:27.857
the organism,
so you can get the same

00:19:27.857 --> 00:19:30.297
genotype replicated and then
test it in different

00:19:30.297 --> 00:19:31.108
environments.
 

00:19:31.108 --> 00:19:34.743
If you wanted to do that for
humans, what kind of data would

00:19:34.743 --> 00:19:35.359
you use?
 

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:40.710
Student:  Twins.
 

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.660
Prof: Twins.
 

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.740
What kind?
 

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.309
Student:  Identical.
 

00:19:43.309 --> 00:19:45.769
Prof: Identical twins.
 

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:49.246
Identical twins are probably
the only--I suppose there might

00:19:49.246 --> 00:19:51.838
rarely be, these days,
identical triplets.

00:19:51.838 --> 00:19:54.752
I suppose there might even be,
somewhere in California,

00:19:54.752 --> 00:19:55.940
identical octuplets.
 

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.733
But most of the time we deal
with identical twins,

00:19:58.733 --> 00:20:01.471
and that's about as far as you
can go, in humans,

00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:03.068
with this sort of thing.
 

00:20:03.068 --> 00:20:05.448
But in Daphnia,
or in plants,

00:20:05.448 --> 00:20:09.269
it's possible to get genotypes
replicated,

00:20:09.269 --> 00:20:12.618
up to a hundred individuals
sometimes,

00:20:12.618 --> 00:20:18.115
and then you can make a very
accurate measure of a reaction

00:20:18.115 --> 00:20:18.778
norm.
 

00:20:18.778 --> 00:20:24.476
You can think of a population
as a bundle of individual

00:20:24.476 --> 00:20:28.415
reaction norms;
and that's an important concept

00:20:28.415 --> 00:20:32.778
because when we come to ecology
we're going to be thinking about

00:20:32.778 --> 00:20:35.338
how predators interact with
prey,

00:20:35.338 --> 00:20:37.950
and about how competitors
interact with each other.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.103
And when we do that,
normally the way that

00:20:40.103 --> 00:20:43.202
biologists have done it in the
past is they've chunked those

00:20:43.202 --> 00:20:45.682
things as species,
where they have a species

00:20:45.682 --> 00:20:46.599
typical property.
 

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:47.598
Okay?
 

00:20:47.598 --> 00:20:50.112
So all the species 1 are
supposed to behave one way,

00:20:50.112 --> 00:20:52.970
and all of species 2 are
supposed to behave another way.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:56.096
But the differences between the
individuals in those species are

00:20:56.096 --> 00:20:58.522
really important,
and when the two species are

00:20:58.522 --> 00:21:01.248
interacting,
it's not like they're all

00:21:01.248 --> 00:21:04.058
identical individuals
interacting.

00:21:04.058 --> 00:21:07.117
They are different,
and when the species interact

00:21:07.117 --> 00:21:10.749
it's bundles of reaction norms
interacting with bundles of

00:21:10.749 --> 00:21:11.960
reaction norms.
 

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.868
And this produces important
effects.

00:21:13.868 --> 00:21:16.011
For example,
it tends to stabilize

00:21:16.011 --> 00:21:17.700
ecological interactions.
 

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:23.301
So remember that for say about
six or eight weeks down the

00:21:23.301 --> 00:21:26.348
line, when we get to ecology.
 

00:21:26.348 --> 00:21:32.730
This property of populations
has important consequences.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.270
There's a real easy way to talk
about the sensitivity of

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.750
phenotypes to the environment.
 

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.390
You just make a reaction norm
plot and look at the slope.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.467
If the slope is steep,
those organisms are very

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:45.009
sensitive to changes in
environment;

00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:47.160
if it's flat, they are not.
 

00:21:51.509 --> 00:21:54.930
And in terms of the kinds of
intellectual tools that one

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.598
might pick up in the course of a
liberal arts education,

00:21:58.598 --> 00:22:02.384
in order to deal in later life
with the claims of people who

00:22:02.384 --> 00:22:05.078
want to talk about the evolution
of IQ,

00:22:05.078 --> 00:22:09.546
or racial differences,
or lots of stuff that involves

00:22:09.546 --> 00:22:13.240
assumptions about genetic
determination,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.536
reaction norms are useful
because they visually describe

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:22.380
the contributions of genes and
environment to the phenotype.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.910
And, for example,
I will put up a speculative

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:33.088
plot, just to illustrate the
potential social significance of

00:22:33.088 --> 00:22:35.868
what I'm talking about.
 

00:22:35.868 --> 00:22:41.414
If, for example,
I put IQ up here and I put

00:22:41.414 --> 00:22:48.808
Family Annual Income down
here--already we're in trouble,

00:22:48.808 --> 00:22:51.502
right;
we're not being politically

00:22:51.502 --> 00:22:53.974
correct anymore--
and then I do this,

00:22:53.974 --> 00:22:58.724
basically what I'm saying is
that if I took human identical

00:22:58.724 --> 00:23:03.230
twins and I raised one here and
the other one here,

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.019
I could get that.
 

00:23:05.019 --> 00:23:05.470
Okay?
 

00:23:09.308 --> 00:23:13.184
And what that shows you--by the
way, I don't know that that is

00:23:13.184 --> 00:23:15.201
true;
I'm just trying to give you

00:23:15.201 --> 00:23:17.972
something to remember,
that will convince you that

00:23:17.972 --> 00:23:20.769
this sort of analysis can
potentially be significant--

00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:24.021
what that shows you basically
is that people might appear to

00:23:24.021 --> 00:23:27.220
be real smart in one environment
and stupid in another,

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.650
compared to the other ones in
the populations,

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.250
and that these things are
context dependent.

00:23:37.118 --> 00:23:41.432
So, that's just an illustration
of this point down here on the

00:23:41.432 --> 00:23:42.068
bottom.
 

00:23:42.068 --> 00:23:45.568
Okay, so I've been talking a
lot about phenotypic plasticity,

00:23:45.568 --> 00:23:48.878
and I've shown you these
wonderful examples of Daphnia

00:23:48.878 --> 00:23:51.940
reacting sensitively to
predators and so forth.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:56.440
Does that mean that organisms
are really plastic?

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.757
Can I just pick up a bunch of
clay and mold it into anything

00:24:00.757 --> 00:24:05.440
that I want, depending on the
environment that I expose it to?

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.730
No I can't.
 

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.368
And that's because,
as we learned last time,

00:24:11.368 --> 00:24:15.489
the large-scale structure is
determined by things that are

00:24:15.489 --> 00:24:18.576
hard to change,
and those are developmental

00:24:18.576 --> 00:24:21.818
patterns that have a deep
evolutionary history,

00:24:21.818 --> 00:24:27.987
and they set up a rigid
framework within which the

00:24:27.987 --> 00:24:31.259
plasticity is expressed.
 

00:24:31.259 --> 00:24:34.255
So the things that change
slowly--those are the

00:24:34.255 --> 00:24:38.162
developmental control genes--are
constraining the things that

00:24:38.162 --> 00:24:39.400
change rapidly.
 

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.670
I just lost a little bit of
text off the bottom.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:48.000
So let's do this with the
example of Distal-less.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.470
Distal-less is a developmental
control gene.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:55.309
The pictures here basically are
showing you how the Drosophila

00:24:55.309 --> 00:24:58.960
larva gets set up very early in
development.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.891
The first thing that happens is
that an anterior/posterior axis

00:25:02.891 --> 00:25:03.970
gets laid down.
 

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.848
That's done by the Hox genes.
 

00:25:05.848 --> 00:25:11.230
Then the dorsoventral axis is
determined by Sog and Chordin

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:15.220
and Decapentaplegic and things
like that.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.680
Then, after the basic axes of
the organisms are laid down and

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.786
segments are formed,
other things turn on that

00:25:22.786 --> 00:25:25.579
determine whether you'll be
dealing with a head,

00:25:25.579 --> 00:25:27.759
a gut or a tail.
 

00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:30.211
Interestingly,
the name for the gene that

00:25:30.211 --> 00:25:33.643
induces heart formation is
Tinman, from the Wizard of Oz,

00:25:33.643 --> 00:25:35.359
who didn't have a heart.
 

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:36.828
Okay?
 

00:25:36.828 --> 00:25:38.950
So they give neat names to some
of these things.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:43.650
And what we're worried about
today is this gene here,

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:47.084
Distal-less,
which determines body wall

00:25:47.084 --> 00:25:48.348
outgrowth.
 

00:25:48.348 --> 00:25:51.400
Remember last time I also
showed you that picture of Pax6;

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.920
that's the gene that induces
eye formation.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.558
But today we're going to talk
about Distal-less.

00:25:56.558 --> 00:26:02.526
And if you look at the body of
a fly, this is where the action

00:26:02.526 --> 00:26:05.950
of certain mutations takes
place.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.980
If you get mutations in
Distal-less, these are the parts

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.460
of the body which are going to
be affected.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.994
They are all extremities,
all out-pocketings of the body

00:26:14.994 --> 00:26:18.722
wall, which are then being
developed into antennae or mouth

00:26:18.722 --> 00:26:19.880
parts or legs.
 

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.027
Vestigial is working on wings
and haltiers,

00:26:23.027 --> 00:26:26.700
and Eyeless is working on the
presence of eyes.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.380
Okay?
 

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:34.074
Now in order to tell you about
this deep developmental

00:26:34.074 --> 00:26:39.747
constraint in butterfly wings,
I first want you to notice that

00:26:39.747 --> 00:26:43.588
there's something that's called
a Nymphalid groundplan.

00:26:43.588 --> 00:26:47.098
The Nymphalidae are a large
family of butterflies,

00:26:47.098 --> 00:26:51.130
and in the nineteenth century
German biologists,

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.150
with German thoroughness,
out to eight decimal places,

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:58.960
did an exhaustive study of
thousands of butterfly wings,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.130
and they were able to take that
whole family of Nymphalidae,

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:07.317
with its hundreds of species,
and reduce them all to

00:27:07.317 --> 00:27:09.700
variations on these themes.
 

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.904
So they found that in the
middle of the wing you could

00:27:11.904 --> 00:27:14.563
have stripes;
in the outer part of the wing

00:27:14.563 --> 00:27:17.856
you could have what they called
border eyespots,

00:27:17.856 --> 00:27:21.553
or border ocelli;
right on the edge of the wing

00:27:21.553 --> 00:27:24.400
you could have bands,
and so forth.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.198
So that this would describe all
of the different kinds of things

00:27:28.198 --> 00:27:30.430
that you could do with
butterflies.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:34.848
And we're going to focus on the
eyespots.

00:27:34.848 --> 00:27:39.304
Now this is the diversity of
butterfly wing patterns that you

00:27:39.304 --> 00:27:44.130
can get in about ten minutes in
the Peabody Museum collections.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:49.160
They are beautiful,
they're just amazing.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.711
I remember the first time I saw
a birdwing butterfly in the

00:27:51.711 --> 00:27:53.779
collections at the Bishop Museum
in Honolulu.

00:27:53.779 --> 00:27:57.548
The birdwings come from New
Guinea and other parts of

00:27:57.548 --> 00:27:58.779
Southeast Asia.
 

00:27:58.779 --> 00:28:00.250
They're about that big.
 

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.858
They're the largest butterflies
on the planet.

00:28:02.858 --> 00:28:07.586
And actually their form is a
bit like this guy,

00:28:07.586 --> 00:28:11.798
except they're about four times
bigger.

00:28:11.798 --> 00:28:16.607
And you can see that simply by
varying the location where

00:28:16.607 --> 00:28:20.510
colors are expressed,
and by varying the size of the

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:24.335
different elements,
you generate a huge number of

00:28:24.335 --> 00:28:25.210
patterns.
 

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:28.568
You can even use them to write
numbers on wings.

00:28:28.568 --> 00:28:31.637
Evolution has written numbers
on the back wing of this

00:28:31.637 --> 00:28:37.288
particular butterfly;
this is an '89 butterfly.

00:28:37.288 --> 00:28:41.219
The model system in which this
is best studied is in a

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:46.163
butterfly called Bicyclus,
and it has been worked on by

00:28:46.163 --> 00:28:50.717
Paul Brakefield in Leiden,
and Sean Carroll in Madison,

00:28:50.717 --> 00:28:53.088
Wisconsin,
and Antonia Monteiro in our

00:28:53.088 --> 00:28:55.784
department,
and a number of other people,

00:28:55.784 --> 00:28:57.500
Vern French in Edinburgh.
 

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.150
And Bicyclus has a number of
neat features.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:05.990
One of them is that it is
developmentally plastic.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:11.688
In the wet season it looks like
this, and in the dry season it

00:29:11.688 --> 00:29:13.368
looks like this.
 

00:29:13.368 --> 00:29:17.234
And, in fact,
these are two brothers who have

00:29:17.234 --> 00:29:21.698
been produced in the laboratory,
with this one being raised

00:29:21.698 --> 00:29:25.008
under wet season conditions and
this one being raised under dry

00:29:25.008 --> 00:29:26.130
season conditions.
 

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:30.920
So one genotype can elicit a
range of phenotypes,

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:36.308
and you can see that in the
process the eyespots change

00:29:36.308 --> 00:29:40.798
considerably in their size and
intensity.

00:29:40.798 --> 00:29:45.500
Now it turns out that you can
fish the Distal-less gene out of

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.200
Drosophila,
and you can use that segment of

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:53.680
DNA to recognize the homolog
gene in the butterfly,

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.548
and you can then put a reporter
onto the homolog,

00:29:58.548 --> 00:30:02.096
and you can ask that gene to
express its reporter when it's

00:30:02.096 --> 00:30:05.278
being expressed,
so that you can see visually

00:30:05.278 --> 00:30:07.730
where the gene's being
expressed.

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:11.397
When that's done,
you can see that every place

00:30:11.397 --> 00:30:15.798
that an eyespot is going to form
in the adult wing,

00:30:15.798 --> 00:30:20.930
you can see the gene being
expressed in the wing disc,

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:24.450
in the developing pupa.
 

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:28.351
The way that butterflies and
flies and other holometabolous

00:30:28.351 --> 00:30:32.453
insects develop is that after
the caterpillar or the larva has

00:30:32.453 --> 00:30:36.957
fed for awhile,
and it's starting to form its

00:30:36.957 --> 00:30:39.621
pupa,
the cells reorganize in the

00:30:39.621 --> 00:30:44.130
pupa, into structures that are
going to be parts of the adult,

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:47.198
and the wing disc,
that's going to be the wing in

00:30:47.198 --> 00:30:50.173
the adult,
looks like this in the pupa,

00:30:50.173 --> 00:30:54.078
and it's sitting right on the
surface of the pupa.

00:30:54.078 --> 00:30:56.441
So that if you want to do
developmental biology

00:30:56.441 --> 00:30:58.864
experiments on it,
you can go through the wall of

00:30:58.864 --> 00:31:01.686
the pupal case and you can pick
out a few cells and you can move

00:31:01.686 --> 00:31:02.358
them around.
 

00:31:02.358 --> 00:31:04.683
So, in fact,
you can go in and cut one of

00:31:04.683 --> 00:31:07.588
these things out and put it down
somewhere else;

00:31:07.588 --> 00:31:13.368
if you do, it will make an
eyespot there.

00:31:13.368 --> 00:31:16.546
So this is actually an
exceedingly neat system to work

00:31:16.546 --> 00:31:19.481
in because you can actually do
cell manipulations,

00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:21.700
as well as genetic
manipulations.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.374
You can manipulate both the
developmental biology and the

00:31:25.374 --> 00:31:28.720
underlying genetic structure,
in butterfly wings.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.569
This is another species;
it just has two eyespots,

00:31:31.569 --> 00:31:34.853
and when you look at its wing
disc, it just has two places

00:31:34.853 --> 00:31:37.098
that Distal-less is being
expressed;

00:31:37.098 --> 00:31:40.573
and those are going to be right
in the center,

00:31:40.573 --> 00:31:43.118
right where that white spot is.
 

00:31:43.118 --> 00:31:50.952
So Distal-less is actually
telling the wing disc where to

00:31:50.952 --> 00:31:55.799
make eyespots,
and the Nymphalid groundplan

00:31:55.799 --> 00:32:00.828
says you can only make those
eyespots in certain places.

00:32:00.828 --> 00:32:06.005
And the Nymphalid groundplan,
the butterfly wing groundplan,

00:32:06.005 --> 00:32:09.690
is arguably about 100,000,000
years old;

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:11.019
it's ancient.
 

00:32:11.019 --> 00:32:14.539
So does that mean that you
can't change the eyespots?

00:32:14.539 --> 00:32:15.759
No it doesn't.
 

00:32:15.759 --> 00:32:19.864
Almost everything about the
eyespots has a reaction norm,

00:32:19.864 --> 00:32:22.430
except their location and
number.

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.981
Within a given species you're
always going to get the same

00:32:24.981 --> 00:32:26.498
number,
and they're always going to be

00:32:26.498 --> 00:32:28.813
in the same place,
but whether they're big or so

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:32.131
small that you can't even see
them depends on the environment

00:32:32.131 --> 00:32:33.788
in which they're expressed.
 

00:32:33.788 --> 00:32:37.650
So if you raise a whole bunch
of families,

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.220
and you compare the siblings
across families,

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.146
to make reaction norms,
you can see that the diameter

00:32:43.146 --> 00:32:46.412
of the white part of the spot
and the diameter of the black

00:32:46.412 --> 00:32:50.240
part of the spot changes as you
go from low to high temperature.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.694
You have low temperatures in
the dry season and high

00:32:53.694 --> 00:32:57.692
temperatures in the wet season,
and that shifts the reaction

00:32:57.692 --> 00:32:59.858
norms on the butterfly wing.
 

00:32:59.858 --> 00:33:05.643
Well I'm a sucker for
analogies, and analogies are

00:33:05.643 --> 00:33:07.058
dangerous.
 

00:33:07.058 --> 00:33:10.559
You might think that the
eyespot was a vase,

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:15.444
and into that vase you're going
to stick a bundle of reaction

00:33:15.444 --> 00:33:16.259
norms.
 

00:33:16.259 --> 00:33:19.090
And you can think of the vase
as being the phylogenetic

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.974
history of the developmental
constraint on the butterfly

00:33:21.974 --> 00:33:23.855
wing,
and it's holding those reaction

00:33:23.855 --> 00:33:27.358
norms within a certain range,
but that the environment then

00:33:27.358 --> 00:33:32.317
is allowing them to vary,
to the degree that a bundle of

00:33:32.317 --> 00:33:36.358
flowers could flop out of a
flower vase.

00:33:36.358 --> 00:33:39.930
Well it turns out--I'm sorry
for this;

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:43.019
this is something that I
checked this morning and it

00:33:43.019 --> 00:33:44.108
wasn't going on.
 

00:33:44.108 --> 00:33:46.548
At any rate,
I'll read this out for you.

00:33:46.548 --> 00:33:50.199
Can we think of macroevolution
as having constructed a vase,

00:33:50.199 --> 00:33:52.549
within which the reaction norms
sit?

00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:53.808
And the answer is no.
 

00:33:53.808 --> 00:33:57.318
And the answer is no because
some of the genes that are

00:33:57.318 --> 00:34:01.088
controlling the shape and the
position of the eyespots--

00:34:01.088 --> 00:34:04.922
so things like Distal-less--are
also involved in determining the

00:34:04.922 --> 00:34:07.720
slopes and the shapes of the
reaction norms.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.630
These two things are
genetically entangled,

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:15.655
and their entanglement is a
case of the same gene having two

00:34:15.655 --> 00:34:20.510
different functions at different
times in development,

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.862
and natural selection will
operate on it throughout the

00:34:24.862 --> 00:34:25.829
lifecycle.
 

00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:28.873
So it's not as though there are
some things that are

00:34:28.873 --> 00:34:31.548
constraints,
that are not being changed,

00:34:31.548 --> 00:34:35.306
and there are other things that
are genes that are sort of

00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:38.010
tweaking the constraints a
little bit.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:42.052
In fact, the same genes are
involved in producing both

00:34:42.052 --> 00:34:42.739
things.
 

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:48.590
So if we want to shift the
slope of the reaction norm by

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:53.909
selecting on phenotypic
plasticity in Bicyclus,

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:59.172
we are going to be selecting on
genes that are also determining

00:34:59.172 --> 00:35:02.400
the location and number of
eyespots.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:07.731
If you think this kind of stuff
is nice, you can go and look on

00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:11.000
the Web, on these sorts of
websites.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.329
Antonia works on butterfly wing
patterns.

00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:17.947
Gunter works on the tetrapod
limb, and with Vinny Lynch he

00:35:17.947 --> 00:35:21.565
has recently been looking into
the origin of the mammalian

00:35:21.565 --> 00:35:23.469
female reproductive tract.
 

00:35:23.469 --> 00:35:26.056
So they have been comparing
things like duckbilled

00:35:26.056 --> 00:35:30.347
platypuses and spiny echidnas--
which are mammals that lay

00:35:30.347 --> 00:35:34.070
eggs--with kangaroos and
eutherians--

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.750
which are mice and lions and
things like us--

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:41.422
and discovering where it is
that the mammalian female

00:35:41.422 --> 00:35:44.250
reproductive tract actually came
from.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:48.119
It turns out that the HOX genes
are involved in that,

00:35:48.119 --> 00:35:50.677
and that it's another one of
these stories of gene

00:35:50.677 --> 00:35:53.340
duplication making the
development of new structures

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.018
possible.
 

00:35:54.018 --> 00:35:58.005
Rick Prum, who's our department
chair and works in the Peabody

00:35:58.005 --> 00:36:00.811
Museum,
is one of the world experts on

00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:04.760
feathers and on the fact that
dinosaurs had feathers,

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.820
and if you're interested in
working with Rick,

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:11.795
you can certainly drop in,
and he's a very friendly guy

00:36:11.795 --> 00:36:16.360
and would be happy to show you
what he knows about feathers.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:22.527
So this is an active area and
it produces a lot of fascinating

00:36:22.527 --> 00:36:23.639
research.
 

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:27.916
To summarize my overview of it,
what I want to emphasize is

00:36:27.916 --> 00:36:31.045
that the phenotype,
the whole organism that you

00:36:31.045 --> 00:36:34.449
see, and the whole lifecycle of
that organism that you see,

00:36:34.449 --> 00:36:38.748
is a mosaic of parts,
and their pattern of

00:36:38.748 --> 00:36:43.780
determination varies
tremendously in evolutionary

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:44.619
age.
 

00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:48.480
So if you just look at my own
body,

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.909
the parts of me that are
extremely old are the fact that

00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:52.590
I have four limbs and five
fingers,

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:57.494
and the parts of me that are
evolutionarily relatively young

00:36:57.494 --> 00:37:02.398
are the size of my cerebral
cortex and some other aspects of

00:37:02.398 --> 00:37:02.980
me.
 

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.675
And if you were to look into
the plasticity of my cerebral

00:37:05.675 --> 00:37:07.923
cortex,
you would discover that it is

00:37:07.923 --> 00:37:10.523
incredibly plastic,
and that when I am a little

00:37:10.523 --> 00:37:13.081
baby and I'm just born,
I have billions more

00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:16.237
connections in my nerve cells
than I do when I'm

00:37:16.237 --> 00:37:19.036
seven-years-old,
and that a great deal of my

00:37:19.036 --> 00:37:21.864
mental development,
between birth and the age of

00:37:21.864 --> 00:37:23.822
seven,
has essentially been the

00:37:23.822 --> 00:37:27.199
remodeling of my cortex by
plastic interactions with the

00:37:27.199 --> 00:37:28.119
environment.
 

00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:31.900
And in fact that's what a lot
of learning is about;

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.179
it's about plastic response to
environment.

00:37:34.179 --> 00:37:38.510
So I am myself,
as are you, a mosaic of things,

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:42.090
of very different evolutionary
ages.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:47.228
The basic developmental
patterns that we see in animals

00:37:47.228 --> 00:37:51.130
are mostly about 500,000,000
years old.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.070
In plants they're a bit younger.
 

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:56.963
The HOX control of body
symmetry and body pattern in

00:37:56.963 --> 00:38:00.780
animals is arguably about
600,000,000 years old;

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.800
maybe a little less,
maybe 550,000,000.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:08.579
The ABC pattern of flower
development in flowering plants

00:38:08.579 --> 00:38:13.617
is probably somewhere between
about 95 and 135,000,000 years

00:38:13.617 --> 00:38:15.266
old;
that's something that happened

00:38:15.266 --> 00:38:15.880
in the Cretaceous.
 

00:38:19.518 --> 00:38:24.603
Now let's shift timescale and
go down to one generation,

00:38:24.603 --> 00:38:27.931
one organism,
encountering a specific

00:38:27.931 --> 00:38:29.409
environment.
 

00:38:29.409 --> 00:38:33.664
Its plastic reaction to the
environment has evolved

00:38:33.664 --> 00:38:37.577
relatively recently,
and it implements specific

00:38:37.577 --> 00:38:39.449
contingency plans.
 

00:38:39.449 --> 00:38:42.673
Daphnia that come from lakes
that do not have fish in them

00:38:42.673 --> 00:38:45.389
and haven't had fish in them for
a long time,

00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:50.340
don't react when you put the
smell of a fish into the water.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:54.552
The Daphnia that come from
lakes that have had fish in them

00:38:54.552 --> 00:38:58.550
for along time react,
and react strongly and quickly.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:05.159
So the plastic reaction is
something that can evolve.

00:39:05.159 --> 00:39:08.648
I want to caution you though,
it is not as though all the

00:39:08.648 --> 00:39:11.889
fine details of the plastic
response are adaptive;

00:39:11.889 --> 00:39:14.840
they are not necessarily all
adaptive.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.960
For example,
think about temperature.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.605
If we are studying the plastic
reactions of organisms to

00:39:21.605 --> 00:39:24.259
temperature,
it may very well be that things

00:39:24.259 --> 00:39:27.362
that live in the Arctic have a
different reaction norm than

00:39:27.362 --> 00:39:30.507
things that live in the tropics,
because they've encountered a

00:39:30.507 --> 00:39:34.092
different temperature regime,
and that that's an evolved

00:39:34.092 --> 00:39:34.969
reaction.
 

00:39:34.969 --> 00:39:38.275
But it's also quite possible
that it's just biophysically

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:41.170
impossible to do something when
it gets colder;

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:45.630
that doesn't have to evolve.
 

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:49.134
So I want you also to be able
to think of the necessity of

00:39:49.134 --> 00:39:52.947
taking something like a plastic
reaction norm and dissecting it

00:39:52.947 --> 00:39:56.389
analytically so that you can
figure out what part of it's

00:39:56.389 --> 00:40:00.079
adaptive and what part of it is
just there because that's the

00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:03.400
kind of stuff that organisms are
built out of.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.166
They are biochemical systems,
and biochemistry,

00:40:06.166 --> 00:40:09.715
we know, has reaction rates
that change with temperature and

00:40:09.715 --> 00:40:11.579
with a lot of other things.
 

00:40:11.579 --> 00:40:13.010
Okay?
 

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:18.289
So it's not--this is not all
adaptive.

00:40:18.289 --> 00:40:22.865
The thing you actually see,
the organism you analyze,

00:40:22.865 --> 00:40:27.003
is just one point on a
multidimensional reaction

00:40:27.003 --> 00:40:28.059
surface.
 

00:40:28.059 --> 00:40:30.829
It could have been a lot of
other things,

00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:35.175
and all those other things that
it could have been are important

00:40:35.175 --> 00:40:38.210
when we think about evolutionary
ecology,

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:40.900
when we think about population
dynamics,

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.601
when we think about
interactions between hosts and

00:40:43.601 --> 00:40:46.228
parasites,
because they represent all

00:40:46.228 --> 00:40:50.119
those other potential
interactions that could be going

00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:52.250
on in other circumstances.
 

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:53.909
Okay?
 

00:40:53.909 --> 00:40:58.222
So by thinking about reaction
norms, we can both express the

00:40:58.222 --> 00:41:01.000
genetic variation in the
population;

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.655
we can express the
developmental reaction to the

00:41:03.655 --> 00:41:06.483
environment, the way all of
those different genetic

00:41:06.483 --> 00:41:09.139
combinations will react to the
environment;

00:41:09.139 --> 00:41:13.164
and we have the potential to
visualize the dynamic over

00:41:13.164 --> 00:41:16.742
generations, as both the gene
frequencies and the

00:41:16.742 --> 00:41:19.650
environmental circumstances
change.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:27.449
So there's a potential here for
a lot of interesting analysis.

00:41:27.449 --> 00:41:32.369
I think the basic take-home
point though is this one.

00:41:32.369 --> 00:41:35.259
Every phenotype is the product
of both genetic and

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:38.771
environmental influences,
and the way they interact to

00:41:38.771 --> 00:41:41.829
produce the phenotype is
extremely important.

00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:46.889
So it is almost never the case
that you can claim that only

00:41:46.889 --> 00:41:51.427
Nature, or only Nurture,
accounts for what you see in

00:41:51.427 --> 00:41:52.650
organisms.
 

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:56.697
So that basically completes
what I want you to know about

00:41:56.697 --> 00:42:00.822
microevolutionary principles,
before we now go into the

00:42:00.822 --> 00:42:04.739
analysis of how natural
selection shapes phenotypes for

00:42:04.739 --> 00:42:06.480
reproductive success.
 

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.360
I'm going to use all these
concepts.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.570
For example,
when we get to the evolution of

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.626
age of maturity,
I'm going to talk about

00:42:14.626 --> 00:42:18.469
reaction norms for age of
maturity in human females,

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:21.500
and in fish, and in mammoths.
 

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.940
So I want you to remember these
elements.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.389
I also want you to remember,
as we go forward,

00:42:29.389 --> 00:42:33.989
that everything that you see in
organisms has an evolutionary

00:42:33.989 --> 00:42:34.909
history.
 

00:42:34.909 --> 00:42:37.690
It doesn't have to be an
adaptive history.

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:39.369
It might be drift.
 

00:42:39.369 --> 00:42:42.744
Things might happen in
phenotypes that are byproducts

00:42:42.744 --> 00:42:46.510
of stuff that's going on
somewhere else in the organism.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:49.762
There are all kinds of
alternatives that you should be

00:42:49.762 --> 00:42:53.208
continually prepared to compare,
when you're trying to analyze

00:42:53.208 --> 00:42:56.088
what you see,
but everything that you see has

00:42:56.088 --> 00:42:56.730
evolved.
 

00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:02.213
All you have to do to see that
is remember at one point your

00:43:02.213 --> 00:43:07.045
ancestors were bacteria,
and everything else has come

00:43:07.045 --> 00:43:08.440
since then.
 

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.574
So next time we're going to
start talking about how

00:43:11.574 --> 00:43:14.710
organisms are designed for
reproductive success;

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:18.309
and our first step is why do
they reproduce sexually?

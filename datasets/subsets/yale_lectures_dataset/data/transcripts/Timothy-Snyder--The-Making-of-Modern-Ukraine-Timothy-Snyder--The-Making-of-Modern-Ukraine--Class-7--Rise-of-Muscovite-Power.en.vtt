00:00:00.573 --> 00:00:05.573
(bright thoughtful music)
(scenes scratching)

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.540
- Okay, greetings
everybody, happy Tuesday.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.140
This is a lecture that I
was not expecting to give.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.300
This was going to be Paul
Bushkovitch's guest lecture,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.070
but as you see, I'm gonna give it.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.590
It's about the origins
of the Muscovite state

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.510
and Muscovite power.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.520
The way things are are gonna
work the rest of the week,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.330
is that on Thursday, my friend
and colleague Glenn Dynner

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.780
is going to give the
lecture on Jews in Ukraine,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.150
something which he is
eminently qualified to do.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.250
Same reading, same
everything, there will just be

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.050
a slightly different
person wearing the shirt

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.170
with the buttons in front of
the classroom on Thursday.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.020
So please give Professor Dynner
the attention he deserves

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.225
for making the schlep up
here and giving the lecture.

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:54.540
One of the TFs will introduce,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.520
and I'll see you again on Tuesday.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.180
So this is also not a lecture
I was expecting to give,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.880
in the sense that when
I gave my first lecture

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.040
about the rise of Muscovite power,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.140
I wouldn't have expected
to be in a situation

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.330
where there is so much to explain.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.000
So we're in the middle of this war where,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.670
just to take two very obvious
points that are pertinent,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.320
the justification for the war,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.180
or one of the justifications for the war

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.970
has to do with the continuation

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.780
of some kind of permanent
identity from Kyiv

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.590
a thousand years ago into Russia today.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.710
Another point, which you'll
see the pertinence of, I hope,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.500
is that many of the people
who are doing the fighting

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.200
in the Russian army today are Asians,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.990
are indigenous people from deep into Asia,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.460
who are disproportionately fighting

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.160
and killing and dying in Ukraine.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.690
And so you might be asking yourself,

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.037
if you're paying attention
day by day in this war,

00:01:48.037 --> 00:01:50.580
"Who are these Buryats,
and why are these Buryats

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.400
doing so much fighting
and dying in Ukraine?"

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.650
Where do they come into the Russian state?

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.420
Why is it that a people
of whom there are only

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.400
a few hundred thousand who live somewhere

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.670
around Lake Baikal deep
into Asia and are Buddhists,

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.110
why are they doing so much

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.180
of the fighting and dying in Ukraine?

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.800
Why is it that when I visit a woman

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.980
living in the suburbs of
Chernihiv, and I'm asking

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.050
who the Russian soldiers are
who were in her basement,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.240
she says, "Well actually,
two of them are Buryats."

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.740
How is that, who are these people?

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.780
What do they have to do
with the history of Russia?

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.260
By the end of this lecture, I
hope that all becomes clear.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.160
So I wanna start with a
philosophical reflection

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.650
about how you get something from nothing,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.720
because once again in this lecture

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.060
we are dealing with the
origins of something.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.980
And of course, the origins of something

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.550
is a very tender, sensitive subject.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.151
Origins are always tricky,
because it would be nice

00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:43.440
if we could have something from nothing.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.354
You might have noticed that
a lot of origin stories

00:02:45.354 --> 00:02:47.940
involve how something, there was something

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.400
beautiful and pure at
the beginning, right?

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.110
And it was corrupted later on.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.000
There was this little thing
called the Book of Genesis,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.290
which is a bit like that.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.240
You might have noticed
that national stories

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.647
are also a bit like that.

00:02:58.647 --> 00:03:01.920
There was an ethnicity, it
was pure, it was simple.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.810
It might have been corrupted
later by foreigners,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.070
and bad things happened.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.330
But deep down in the beginning,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.640
it was all folk songs and harmony

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.760
before the other people came
and messed everything up.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.290
Naturally, you'll have understood,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.220
I'm sure you're understood already,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.930
but it's been a main theme of this class,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.540
that things don't come out of nowhere.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.870
That the states and the nations
that we're trying to explain

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.910
always have something to do with contacts

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.410
with other states and nations.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.510
There's always something out there,

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.430
which is at the beginning of the story,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.620
but it's not in the
beginning of its own story.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.053
It's in the middle or or at the end.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.380
So one way to deal with this problem

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.240
of how you have things
that didn't exist before

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.580
is to imagine this, you
know, this state of Eden,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.810
this state of innocence.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.340
Another way to deal with this problem

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.080
is the way that social
sciences deal with it,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.800
or the way that, ooh, the
social science PhD perks up.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.730
The way that, that would be
Daniel, yeah he's a postdoc.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.770
Daniel say hi, he's also Ukrainian.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.920
Now you've been doxxed.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.210
So the way that social sciences

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.440
generally deal with the question

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.000
of how you get something from nothing,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.260
is you just start with the something.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.490
You don't worry about the origins,

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.750
things just are as they are.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.460
And something similar can
be said about philosophy,

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.650
that we just assume that there's a person,

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.483
there's a kind of, you know,

00:04:14.483 --> 00:04:16.200
there's a person, the
person is fully formed.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.350
We don't worry about the
way the person came from.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.420
In history, we have to confront,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.040
like the weird stories of origins,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.030
but we also have to come up with

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.370
a plausible story of origin ourself.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.650
And I wanted to suggest that a root

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.530
for plausible stories of
origin would be something

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.200
more like Ovid's "Metamorphoses",

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.220
which I don't know if you've studied,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.060
but the "Metamorphoses" of Ovid
are all about weird contacts

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.250
involving violence and sex and families

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.510
that generally don't work out,

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.280
but the theme is transformation.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.600
You're not getting something from nothing.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.220
You're getting something
from something else.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.650
You're getting something
from some kind of encounter.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.750
And history is more like that.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.680
It's, unexpected things arise
from the encounters of things,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.180
and then later on you tell a story

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.800
about how it had to be that way.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.130
But at the time, it's all
very messy and confusing.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.680
It involves some kind of transformation.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.840
Okay, check out this segue.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.920
So Ovid's "Metamorphoses" were
probably the major influence

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.040
or a major influence on Shakespeare.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.180
When I talked to Zelenskyy

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.280
a couple of Saturdays ago in Kyiv,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.560
he made the point that
everything was in Shakespeare,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.440
which has me thinking about
"Hamlet" as I often do anyway.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.110
Hamlet was a prince of what? Help me out.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.943
- Denmark?
- Denmark.

00:05:25.943 --> 00:05:28.320
- A hundred out of a hundred
for the classroom, excellent.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.850
Everybody who spoke up got it right,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.290
and everybody who didn't know was quiet,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.140
which is like perfect
yell behavior, well done.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.643
(students laughing)

00:05:35.643 --> 00:05:39.060
So Denmark, and Denmark
is an heir of what?

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.413
What kind of a state is it?

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.540
Vikings, right?

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.546
Okay, you fell back on the TFs.

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:46.170
It's a Viking state, right?

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.825
So, Denmark, Sweden, Norway,

00:05:48.825 --> 00:05:51.180
which for a long time is part of Denmark,

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.320
Iceland, and Rus, these
are all Viking states.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.900
These are all post Viking states,

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.810
and also another post Viking
state which we might forget,

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.160
because we think of it
as so big and important.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.640
It's the language I'm speaking.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.320
- England.
- England, right?

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.859
England is also a post Viking state.

00:06:08.859 --> 00:06:11.790
So this phenomenon of post Viking states

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.763
is very important in European history,

00:06:13.763 --> 00:06:18.100
From England all the way
to the East Slavic lands

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.130
The England of Shakespeare is
a post Viking state, right?

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.500
The Normans, I'm just gonna
run this through with you

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.910
and you'll see where it's going.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.850
The Normans who invaded England in 1066,

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.160
Norman means Northman or Norseman.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.950
The Normans were a synthetic people

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.070
of Vikings who had arrived
in northern France,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.210
who were there for a while,

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.460
and then they later invaded England.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.440
When they invaded England in 1066,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.040
they invaded England in
1066 three days after

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.410
the Norwegians invaded England in 1066.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.230
It was actually a kind of
post Viking pincer movement

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.950
in England in the early autumn of 1066.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.170
The king of Norway who invaded England

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.590
in September of 1066 was Harald Hardrada,

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.701
who you were definitely going to remember,

00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:07.170
was in the service of Yaroslav the Wise

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.270
in early Kyivan Rus'.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.760
Harald is the same figure
who shows up in Kyiv,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.170
who doesn't have much else to do,

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.536
and becomes a warrior in the
service of Yaroslav the Wise,

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:21.536
who we know about all this
thanks to the Icelandic sagas.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.600
You'll remember Yaroslav the
Wise is the one who shows up

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.897
in the Iceland sagas as Jarislief,

00:07:26.897 --> 00:07:30.450
less flatteringly as
Jarislief the Lame, right?

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.970
So this is all one world, right?

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.630
The post Viking, who is invading England

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.200
as the Norwegian king, is
the same post Viking Harald

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.050
who was in the service of
Yaroslav the Wise in Kyiv,

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.740
and who then went on to
serve in Byzantium, okay.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.500
So he fails, by the way.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.840
So Harald has this great, he
has this fascinating life.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.820
He starts out in Norway, he goes to Kyiv,

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.380
he serves Yaroslav the Wise.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.060
Shows up in the Icelandic sagas,

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.150
which let's face it, none of
us is ever gonna do, right?

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.776
Shows up in the Icelandic sagas.

00:08:01.776 --> 00:08:06.776
He goes on to Byzantium, he
serves as part of a Ruthenian

00:08:07.113 --> 00:08:10.380
or a Rusyn bodyguard in Byzantium,
then goes back to Norway,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.630
succeeds in becoming
King, invades England,

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.010
but gets killed right away, okay.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.180
So like that's, you know,

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.250
not the way it would've
ended in the Netflix serial,

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.670
but that's so, but his
life, this life of Harald,

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.250
it reminds us that there's this whole arc

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.260
from Scandinavia to Byzantium.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.330
And in this arc of history, right?

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.040
Or really from England to Byzantium,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.701
where the Vikings are in the middle,

00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:32.805
and the big pushing forces

00:08:32.805 --> 00:08:36.030
were the Franks and the Byzantines.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.680
The Franks and the Byzantines are pushing

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.970
from one side and the other,

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.590
the Vikings show up in the middle,

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.060
and then the Vikings end up having to do

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.130
with the creation of a
whole bunch of states

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.810
from England all the way down,

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.360
all the way down to Rus', okay.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.170
So when the Normans,

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.600
the Normans are the post
Vikings who win, right?

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.720
The Norwegians lose, but the
Normans are the ones who win.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.790
And it's often forgotten
that there were two attacks

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.290
on England at exactly the same time,

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.540
although I saw some nodding
in the gallery, which is cool.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.651
So the Normans are the post
Vikings who win England.

00:09:06.651 --> 00:09:09.900
Their leader goes under the
name of William the Conqueror.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.570
He kills the English king,
he establish his own elites,

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.790
and the language has changed, right?

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.110
The language has changed.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.180
So remember, another
big theme of this class,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.510
our big argument is how the
language is there for you.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.970
The language and the people
are not necessarily identical.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.303
Languages change, people
move into languages.

00:09:27.303 --> 00:09:30.690
So the English language
that we're moving into now,

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.580
or that we're using
now has something to do

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.620
with William the Conqueror
conquering England.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.610
It would be very hard for me

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.440
to create a sentence in English

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.569
which doesn't involve a
word which came from French.

00:09:39.569 --> 00:09:41.896
You know, I'm not gonna
like show off at this point,

00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:45.780
but I will give you,
I'll read you a passage

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.830
which we've already read,

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.252
which is Chaucer's
"Canterbury Tales" from 1380,

00:09:49.252 --> 00:09:50.947
the same passage.

00:09:50.947 --> 00:09:52.740
"A knight there was and that a worthy man,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.930
that from the time that he
first began to riden out,

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.774
he loved chivalry, truth and
honor, freedom and courtesy."

00:09:57.774 --> 00:09:59.910
Right, there isn't gonna
be chivalry or courtesy

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.890
in Chaucer without the Normans,

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.780
without the post Vikings invading England.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.052
Or Shakespeare and "Hamlet",
the most famous speech

00:10:06.052 --> 00:10:07.897
is "to be or not to be" right?

00:10:07.897 --> 00:10:10.177
Which includes a beautiful line about how

00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:12.600
"conscience makes cowards of us all",

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.430
which he couldn't have written
without the word conscience,

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.160
which of course is a French word, okay.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.260
So you've gotten the point about this,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.660
this big political cultural synthesis,

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.520
which takes place over a few centuries,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.280
and how our world is part of that world.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.901
Our East Slavic Rus' world
is part of that world,

00:10:28.901 --> 00:10:30.776
although it's special.

00:10:30.776 --> 00:10:34.440
And one way that it's
special, as you know,

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.860
is that the East Slavic world Rus'

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.410
becomes Christian under the Byzantines,

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.730
whereas all the rest of it's going to be

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.395
Western Christian, right? Boring.

00:10:43.395 --> 00:10:46.077
Whereas our part is going
to be Eastern Christian.

00:10:46.077 --> 00:10:47.790
The other thing which is special,

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.080
by the time we get to this lecture,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.640
and this is the subject of this lecture,

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.320
is that it no longer exists.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.790
So, England, Norway, Norway
slash Denmark, Sweden,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.490
these are all fairly
durable political entities.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.630
England is still around.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.700
I mean, by the end of
the semester let's see

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.952
but England is still around,

00:11:04.952 --> 00:11:08.430
and Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, they're also around.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.090
Rus' is not still around, and
so that's another difference,

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.280
and that's the subject that
we're getting to today.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.077
What actually happens to Rus',

00:11:17.204 --> 00:11:21.510
and how are we best to think about that?

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.800
So I introduced a next moment of contact

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.779
in the last lecture.

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:28.970
The moment of contact I tried to introduce

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.220
in the last lecture was
another East/West moment,

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.010
which was the Mongols
coming from one side,

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:39.570
and the Teutonic Knights
coming from the other side.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:44.100
So if we're going to explain
the origins of Lithuania

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.770
as we tried to do in the last lecture,

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.410
we explain the origins of Lithuania

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.960
not by saying they were
always Lithuanians,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.150
they were always wonderful
pagans, they were very innocent.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.830
You know, they did a
lot of human sacrifice,

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.650
which is how you preserve
innocence, as we all know.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:11:59.730
No I mean honestly, you've had,

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.140
I mean the human sacrifice,
well I mean. (sighing)

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.060
Where do I draw all the lines on the jokes

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.950
knowing that I'm filmed?
(students laughing)

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.170
That's just occurred to
me for the first time.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.790
But let's face it, human sacrifice has

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.170
a kind of simplicity and clarity,

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.140
which other forms of,
you know, ritual don't.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.710
So the, where was I?

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.200
Oh, so the Lithuanians, it's
not that the Lithuanians

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.610
were always there and they were pure

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.810
and they were an ethnicity and so on.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.040
That's not the story at all, right?

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.110
The story is that the Lithuanians saw

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.940
what happened to the Prussians,

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.940
the Lithuanians gathered
together some tribes,

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.450
some Pagan tribes who speak
the Baltic Lithuanian language.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.060
The Lithuanians went south and gathered up

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.565
most of the lands that had
been Rus', and on that basis

00:12:42.565 --> 00:12:46.260
were able to stand up
to the Teutonic Knights.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.840
And then because there was a
rising state called Poland,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.194
the Lithuanians married
into the Polish crown,

00:12:51.194 --> 00:12:56.040
and in alliance with
Poland, and having annexed

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.380
most of what was Rus', Lithuania had,

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.210
there the Lithuanian
rulers created the state

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.340
which could actually defeat
the Teutonic Knights.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.650
But all of that only makes
sense, that whole rise

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.440
of Lithuania as a great
state only makes sense

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.130
if you understand Teutonic
Knights pushing from the West,

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.220
Mongols have come in from
the East and destroyed Rus'.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.677
If the Mongols don't destroy Rus',

00:13:15.677 --> 00:13:17.579
Lithuania is not going to annex it.

00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:19.410
If Teutonic Knights are not pushing in

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.300
with their program of
forced Christianization,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.340
the Lithuanians aren't
going to consolidate.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.590
So this is another one of these symphonies

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.800
where larger pressures
push, particularities arise,

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.890
new states are consolidated, right?

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.970
And so we get to this, we've
already gotten to this.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.980
It's the next few verses
in Chaucer, right?

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.677
So the Chaucer, "Above all
nations in Pruce and Lettow,

00:13:41.677 --> 00:13:43.890
had he reysed and in Ruce,"
you know what that means.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.200
The Teutonic Knights were
the (speaking in German).

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.424
Great German word, by the way.

00:13:47.424 --> 00:13:48.487
A (speaking in German) now is just like,

00:13:48.487 --> 00:13:50.306
"I'm gonna make, you know,
making a little trip,

00:13:50.306 --> 00:13:51.180
(speaking in German)."

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.996
But in this context, it
means part of a crusade.

00:13:53.996 --> 00:13:55.590
You're joining a crusade.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.480
You're coming from France or
England or somewhere far away,

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.700
you're going to join in a crusade.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.160
Pruce is Prussia, which
has been fully destroyed.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.640
Lettow is Lithuania, and
Ruce is of course Rus'.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.923
So that's kind of interesting, isn't it?

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.620
I'm sure when you read
this in high school,

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.180
or in your free time, or when
you read it in the future,

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.267
you just skimmed right over,

00:14:13.267 --> 00:14:15.360
"What is this Ruce place, R-U-C-E?

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.200
Probably Chaucer made it up
to rhyme with Pruce," right?

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.780
But no, Ruce is actually
the country R-U-S,

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.640
which we've been studying,
which in the 14th century

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.340
was a completely unproblematic word, okay.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.720
So this Lithuanian trajectory we followed,

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.120
and we're gonna keep following it.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.920
We're gonna keep following
the trajectory of what

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.070
in this lecture I'm gonna
call Lithuanian Rus'.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.400
Because if we're gonna understand the,

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.114
if we're gonna move east and
understand the consequences

00:14:44.114 --> 00:14:49.114
of the Mongol destruction
of Kyiv in 1237 to 1240,

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.307
we have to then move into the question

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:55.620
of the successors of Rus'.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.493
And the successors of Rus'

00:14:58.493 --> 00:15:00.960
are going to overlap with other things.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.150
They're going to overlap
with the Mongol world,

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.993
but not only.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.660
Very briefly, we've already done

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.980
one of the successors of Rus'.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.230
One of the successors
of Rus' is Lithuania.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.247
The Lithuanian Grand
Dukes called themselves

00:15:12.247 --> 00:15:16.593
the rulers of Ruthenia,
and Ruthenia in Latin,

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.533
of Rus' in their own language.

00:15:20.992 --> 00:15:24.446
So one of the successors of
of Rus' is Lithuanian Rus'.

00:15:24.446 --> 00:15:27.374
A second successor of Rus',
which we briefly talked about,

00:15:27.374 --> 00:15:30.150
is Galicia and Volhynia.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.760
So this is all, right?
This is all on your sheet.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.415
Okay? You nodding, thank you.

00:15:34.415 --> 00:15:38.520
So Galicia and Volhynia are the two

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:43.170
Westernmost districts of Rus'.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.290
These are very important places to know.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.600
They're very interesting places.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.970
Galicia and Volhynia are English words

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:55.740
which come from Latin,
but the original terms

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.290
come from the old Ruthenian
names for the places,

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.550
(speaking in foreign
language), hence Galicia,

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:06.332
And then Volhynia in Latin is
actually (speaking in Latin),

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.520
but (speaking in Latin),
you don't have to know this,

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.750
I'm just giving you a little break.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.610
You don't have to write it
down, I'm just cruising.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.168
So Volhynia in Latin is (speaking Latin),

00:16:14.168 --> 00:16:16.980
is from the city of Volodymyr.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.510
Volodymyr becomes (speaking in Latin),

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.974
and Volodymyr is course
of city named after

00:16:20.974 --> 00:16:25.200
the first baptized ruler of
Russia, which is Volodymyr.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.450
So Galicia and Volhynia are what we call

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.150
these Western districts,
they're very important

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.323
because they hold out as rulers of Rus'

00:16:35.817 --> 00:16:37.953
for an extra century or so.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.490
They, the leaders of Galicia and Volhynia,

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.760
claimed also to be the rulers of Kyiv.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.663
They very often actually had
their person ruling Kyiv.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:54.450
After the Mongol onslaught,
they managed to hold their own

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.916
in Galicia and Volhynia.

00:16:55.916 --> 00:16:59.340
After 1240 they were
the only princes of Rus'

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.590
who actually engaged the
Mongols on the battlefield

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.593
with anything other than complete failure.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.790
So, and they managed to hold
Kyiv, actually, but of course.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.260
But they managed to hold their own lands,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.220
and consolidate the rule over
their own lands in the 1240s.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.480
After the end of Kyiv, after
the destruction of Kyiv,

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.360
they refer to themselves
as Princes of Rus'

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.323
and Princes of all of Rus'.

00:17:23.323 --> 00:17:26.010
In case I don't get to it
later, this is a theme.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.900
If you're gonna call
yourself the Prince of Rus',

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.570
just go ahead and call yourself
the Prince of all of Rus',

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.880
and you will eventually
figure out in practice

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.310
how much all of Rus' turns out to be.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.280
That is the answer to the
question of what all of Rus' is.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.140
All of these people called themselves

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.330
the Prince of all of Rus', okay?

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.520
Nobody said, "I'm the
Prince of Some of Rus',

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.170
and maybe somebody else is," no.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.880
They all when they, as
soon as they thought of it,

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.890
they all said, "I'm the
Prince of all of Rus'."

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.625
And the question of what all of Rus' is,

00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:55.530
is determined by practice,
how far you can actually get,

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.720
and then you will call that Rus',

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.183
whether it was historically Rus' or not.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.710
So in 2022 we're in a war where
Russia is fighting Ukraine

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.900
in territories on the basis of the idea

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.530
that these territories are
formerly Rus', but they're not.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.750
The lands in the south of Ukraine

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.910
are territories of the Crimean Khanate.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.760
They were never part
of Rus', and but never,

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.820
so, and this is a traditional theme.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.380
When Moscow, and I'm gonna get to this,

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.270
when Moscow takes over Novgorod,

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.250
Novgorod suddenly becomes Rus',

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.560
but Novgorod didn't itself
think that it was Rus'.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.570
It only becomes Rus'
after it was conquered,

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.403
and so on and so forth.

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:34.040
So the whole idea of
controlling all of Rus'

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.720
is essentially a pragmatic idea, right?

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.420
After the destruction of Rus', okay.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.439
So the point about Galicia-Volhynia

00:18:43.439 --> 00:18:46.230
is that it's gonna have a bright future.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.240
Galicia and Volhynia are
very important to the future,

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.470
to the history of Ukraine.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.350
But also they maintained some kind

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.840
of Rusyn Ruthenian statehood for,

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.817
basically a bonus century
into the 1320s, 1330s,

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.910
when they fall to Lithuania and to Poland.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.560
So about 1320, the Lithuanians
have gotten to Kyiv,

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.121
and Volhynia becomes
part of Lithuania, okay?

00:19:11.121 --> 00:19:12.450
Volhynia becomes part of Lithuania.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:17.450
Galicia, Halychyna, becomes
part of Poland as of as of 1339.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.790
Okay, so that's, so now we
have two successors of Rus'.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.410
We have the Lithuanian Rus',

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.100
and we have the Galicia and
Volhynia Rus', that's two.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.500
The third one, the one that we're gonna

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.190
focus on today is Mongol Rus'.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:37.190
So the part of Rus' which falls
durably under Mongol control

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.520
from circa 1240 deep
into the 15th century.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.710
So a different story, a
story of multiple centuries,

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.330
multiple generations.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:52.350
Time matters a lot.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.450
So this is just a basic historian's point.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:57.360
It matters a lot whether
regime governs a territory

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.220
for 50 years, a hundred
years, or 300 years, right?

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.747
That's just a very,
it's a very basic point.

00:20:03.747 --> 00:20:05.580
And so when we're starting to think about

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.860
what's different between Galicia-Volhynia

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:12.860
and the Northeastern territories
that become Mongol Rus',

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.000
durability of Mongol rule.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.890
Galicia-Volhynia encountered the Mongols.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.010
They only very briefly paid tribute.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.200
The territories of Mongol Rus',

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.210
hint, Mongol Rus' is
what's gonna become Moscow

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.010
and the Russian Empire and
all the rest of it, okay?

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.680
So the territories that
become Mongol Rus',

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.550
that are Mongol Rus',

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:33.870
are under Mongol control for centuries.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.711
That's a basic fundamental difference.

00:20:36.711 --> 00:20:41.711
So Mongol Rus', here's
another way to think about it.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.480
It is one of the successors
of Rus' for sure,

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.070
and we're gonna see the connections

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.407
between Mongol Rus' and Kyivan Rus'.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:55.250
But it is also one of the many
Mongol or post Mongol states

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.750
all across Asia and eastern Europe.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.840
So the Mongols, after
they come and destroy,

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.440
which admittedly is like,
that's their famous moment.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.520
1240, 1241, they arrive, they destroy,

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.420
they conquer everyone.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.550
They have to go back for
a funeral, as happens,

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.440
changes all of history, right?

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.920
The Batu Khan arrives, he
destroys, no one can resist him.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.020
Gets a phone call,
didn't get a phone call.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.530
He gets notice that he
has to go back to Mongolia

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.690
basically, for what?
For a succession crisis.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.820
A funeral is the polite way of saying it,

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.950
but a succession struggle.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.950
When someone dies, there's a
succession struggle, right?

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.630
Those of you who have families
that don't write wills,

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.467
you know what I'm talking about.

00:21:35.467 --> 00:21:39.910
So the, uneasy class-based laughter, okay?

00:21:42.462 --> 00:21:44.520
(students laughing)

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.120
So I have to say that because
apparently they can't hear

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.470
when you laugh on the video.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.420
That's been reported to me,
like they can hear the jokes

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.793
but like, then there's silence.

00:21:52.793 --> 00:21:55.440
(students laughing)

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.950
Which from my point of view is
a little bit awkward, right?

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.660
It's like, "He's telling
jokes all semester,

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.300
and the Yale students are
just a looking at him."

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.560
Okay, so 1240, so 1237 to 1241,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.030
that's the period that you all remember.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.220
The Batu Khan comes, he
conquers, no one's resistant,

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.060
so he goes back.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.170
But after this, there is the Mongol state,

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:17.790
which is remembered under the name

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.620
of the Golden Horde, okay?

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.280
And then, but the Golden Horde over time,

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.760
itself falls apart into various entities.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.420
And these entities don't,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.990
they're often very fuzzy
in European history.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.970
They kind of just show up on the margins

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.130
every now and again, making attacks,

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.750
or as allies in wars or whatever.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.483
But these are fairly durable entities.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.900
And we have to understand Moscow

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.480
and not just as a post Rus' entity,

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.100
but also as one of these
post Mongol entities,

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:55.100
along with the Nogai Horde,
along with the Kazan Khanate,

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.660
along with the Crimean Khanate.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.760
And by the way, for
us, the Crimean Khanate

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.860
is the most important
because the Crimean Khanate

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.200
is the one that controls Crimea,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.590
and then much of the north
coast of the Black Sea,

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.330
what's now the south of Ukraine.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:14.330
So we have to imagine the
Mongols establishing a state,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.460
which over time fragments into a number

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.360
of different entities,
of which one is Moscow.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.520
Of which one is Moscow.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.620
Now, how is Moscow different?

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.600
Moscow is different in religion.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.520
It's not Pagan as the Mongols are,

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.830
to use the term of abuse
that the Christians use.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.650
And Moscow doesn't convert to Islam.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:35.640
This is important too.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.340
The rest of these
entities convert to Islam.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:43.340
So, but Moscow doesn't,
Moscow is Orthodox.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.170
Moscow's Orthodox, but it's Orthodox

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.060
in an interesting way, right?

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.840
It's Orthodox in a place,
mark this for the future.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.121
It's Orthodox in a place

00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:56.070
where there's no other
way of being Christian.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.540
This is really important, I mean,

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.190
I think right down to the present moment.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:00.660
There's no other way of being Christian.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.030
If you're Christian,
you're Orthodox, that's it.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:07.080
Whereas west of this, in Kyiv
and in the rest of Europe,

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.660
there are going to be lots of
other ways of being Christian.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.730
And even if you are Orthodox,

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.880
in what's now Ukraine,
Belarus, Poland, Lithuania,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.740
you're going to be in
a series of encounters

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.950
with other sorts of Christians
over the next few centuries.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.750
In Moscow, this is not true.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.230
Orthodoxy is Christianity,
Christianity is Orthodoxy.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.560
And this is all, and related
to this, also to mark,

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.450
there isn't any theology.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:34.740
There isn't any disputation
about religion in Moscow.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.110
In points further west
there is going to be,

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.270
the Orthodox are going to take part

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.770
in all of the interesting conversations

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.170
around Reformation,
Counter-Reformation, all of that.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.530
That's not going to be happening
in Moscow until much later,

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:50.250
when Moscow and Kyiv come into
contact for the first time,

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:51.960
which is not for centuries.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.790
It's not for centuries,
it's not in this lecture,

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.160
it's in the 17th century, okay.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.640
So we're in Mongol Rus'.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.580
Mongol Rus' is the northeast.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.573
It's the district which I
mentioned last time, Suzdal.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.170
And then Suzdal, surrounding territories,

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:17.457
the northeast of what had been Rus'.

00:25:18.705 --> 00:25:23.705
And the way that the political
system is set up by this,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.340
is set up in this Northeastern
Rus', this Mongol Rus',

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.890
is really a kind of fresh start,

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.800
in the sense that the Mongols
have come and destroyed.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.290
Okay, good, that's true for everyone.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.320
Then there's the Black
Death, it's a bit of a mess.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.543
There's really no one around to write.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:47.520
And in addition to that, a new principle

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.680
of political succession is set up.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.350
The principle of political
succession in the old Rus',

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.680
the one based in Kyiv
was admittedly very messy

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.720
and to the point of incomprehensibility,

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.810
but it had something to do
with the ruler and his sons.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.820
That's about as much as we can say.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.740
And that's by the way,
not so unusual in Europe.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.300
This whole idea that
it was the eldest son,

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.290
and it was all very simple.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.420
That usually covers over a whole bunch

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:13.530
of illegitimacy and
bloodshed, but you know, okay.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:16.680
So illegitimacy and
bloodshed gets a lot of nods.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.330
I just wanna record that for the camera.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.689
All right, so focus.

00:26:21.689 --> 00:26:26.400
So in Northeastern Rus',
in and around Suzdal,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.043
there's a new succession
principle which is,

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:34.910
how well can you collect
taxes for the Mongol overlord?

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.460
That's the new principle of power.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:41.760
So the Mongols accept that
there's something called Rus'.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.890
They have no trouble with that,

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.710
but who is the Grand Prince of Rus'?

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.110
The Grand Prince of Rus' is

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.420
the person who can collect the tribute.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.850
So that is a new principle of rule.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.900
That is new compared to Kyiv obviously,

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.190
where if you were in Kyiv,

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.810
you were the one taking
the tribute, right?

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.200
And by the way, this is a
really fundamental thing

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.790
about political power.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.370
If you want to figure out
who is actually in charge,

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.680
who is paying tribute to whom?

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.740
Because everyone says,
"I'm the king and the tsar,

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.119
and all the galaxies," and so on, right?

00:27:16.119 --> 00:27:17.640
That's very easy.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.340
Having stationary, okay, they
didn't have stationary yet,

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.510
but having a list of
titles is very easy, right?

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.900
But what really matters is,
are you paying the tribute,

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.630
or is someone paying the tribute to you?

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:34.410
So the rulers of Muscovy
had titles, right?

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:37.440
They were the Grand Princes of Moscow,

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.514
which sounds great and
certainly had its pluses.

00:27:40.514 --> 00:27:44.790
But they were paying
tribute to the Mongols,

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.810
and they were the Grand Princes of Moscow

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.970
because they could pay
tribute to the Mongols.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:54.420
The Mongols chose the man who
could collect the tribute.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.630
And so that's a different
principle of succession.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.290
The people who ran Mongol
Rus' were princes of,

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:04.020
they were princes who were
descended from the old Rus'.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.390
Not in any particular distinction,

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.820
but they were of the blood,

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.530
but they were only the
Grand Princes of Rus'

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:12.870
because they were the ones
who could collect the taxes.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.300
And then the other way
that this is a fresh start

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:20.300
is that the whole system
is based in a new city,

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.370
which is Moscow.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.700
So Moscow existed as some
kind of fort or something

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.540
in the 12th century, but
Moscow had no princely line.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.700
Moscow is not a district in old Rus'.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.310
Nobody goes to Moscow
to rule anything, right?

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:39.840
It's not one of these districts
Suzdal or like Chernihiv,

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.640
where you go and you rule.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.960
It's not a district at all.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.330
It's no place, it's nowhere.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:50.250
Moscow becomes a town,
becomes a meaningful place

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:55.250
with a princely line after the
Mongol destruction of Kyiv,

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.620
and because it's a Prince of Moscow

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.260
who's able to collect the tribute.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.010
It was also, well, there's
also some marriage involved.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:10.770
In 1317, Yuri, who was a Prince of Moscow,

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:14.883
married the sister of the Khan
of the Golden Horde, right?

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.570
As one does, you know, in
situations like this, right?

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:22.860
So he also marries into
power, and at that point,

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.460
power passed durably from a more important

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.430
bigger city called Tver to Moscow.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.140
And from that point, Moscow is gonna be

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.370
the center of this entity.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.590
And it's gonna be the Princes of Moscow

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.450
who eventually remember,
it takes them a while,

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.627
but who eventually remember to say,

00:29:40.627 --> 00:29:44.070
"We are the rulers of all of Rus'."

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.830
The first one, by the way
to, as far as we know,

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.080
who says that he's the ruler of all Rus'

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:53.997
was Vasily I, who ruled from 1389 to 1399.

00:29:53.997 --> 00:29:56.097
And the evidence we have is there's a coin

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:02.070
where he appears, and he says,
"I am the ruler of all Rus'."

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.597
On the other side of that coin, it says,

00:30:04.597 --> 00:30:07.890
"Long live Sultan Tokhtamysh",

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.130
which reminds you of what the
actual political order is.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.590
He's the ruler of all of Rus', terrific.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:16.020
But what he means by all
of Rus' is the bit of Rus'

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:19.290
that is under the control
of the Golden Horde, right?

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:22.560
That's under the control of the Mongols.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.000
Now all of this, the Mongol
connection is very important

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.360
because when the Mongol
connection is broken,

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.483
the basic state form remains.

00:30:33.483 --> 00:30:36.360
There's no clear moment
in the history of Muscovy

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.090
where you can say, "Okay,
the Mongols were here,

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.320
they were doing everything,

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.840
and then they got on their
little horses and left."

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.910
That's not how it worked at all.

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:46.920
The way that it worked was that

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.120
somewhere in the middle
of the 15th century,

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.110
Moscow stops paying tribute.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:53.850
But they don't change at that point,

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.200
they just stop paying tribute.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.740
It's the same entity, okay?

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.120
So have a state which is
in some way post Rus'.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.560
Religion, princely family,
language, all of that.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.050
But it's also in many ways a new start,

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.120
a new start under the Mongols.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:17.120
So it's post post Rus', I would
say, and it's post Mongol.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.980
Let me say a word now about the system,

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:23.340
because the system is
incredibly interesting.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.120
First of all, and to give
credit where credit is due,

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.970
the Muscovites knew how to fight.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.740
And the reason they knew how to fight

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.140
was that they fought with,

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.660
and then eventually against the Mongols.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.970
So the Mongol cavalry techniques,

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:41.070
which the Mongols brought
with them to Europe

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.690
and which no one could withstand,

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.480
were then learned by the
Muscovites, because of course,

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.310
the Muscovites were
part of the same state.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.830
They were fighting on the same side.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:52.140
So they were very good at war.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.057
And the way that they set up
their armies in five parts

00:31:55.057 --> 00:31:56.283
has everything to do with the way

00:31:56.283 --> 00:31:59.160
that the Mongols set set up their armies.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.636
So that's very important to know.

00:32:01.636 --> 00:32:04.470
The Muscovites knew how to fight,

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:06.990
that is part of their heritage.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:10.470
The heritage that they don't have is all

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.920
the legal bureaucratic heritage of Kyiv,

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.790
which we've talked about earlier.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:15.930
They're free and clear of that.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.690
For better or worse, they're
free and clear of that.

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:21.295
It's rather the Lithuanians
who pick up that heritage,

00:32:21.295 --> 00:32:23.700
which means that the legal tradition

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.090
in Mongol Rus' is very simple.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:30.813
It starts from the idea that
the tsar owns everything,

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.593
which is convenient.

00:32:33.593 --> 00:32:36.630
I mean, it's very convenient
if you're the tsar.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.780
And okay, and when I say all this,

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.553
don't overdo it, but do
record this and think about it

00:32:43.553 --> 00:32:46.320
when you're thinking about
the history of Russia,

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.273
the centuries, as centuries pass.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.563
So all the property belongs
to the tsar, the ruler.

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:55.320
You can't really own land.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.300
You can own land conditionally.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.489
If I'm the tsar, I'm gonna be the tsar,

00:32:59.489 --> 00:33:01.410
'cause I'm the one who's talking.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:02.640
You can own land conditionally

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.670
until I say that you don't anymore, right?

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.870
So land ownership can
be broken at any time.

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:12.990
You own land practically, in exchange

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.030
for service to me, the tsar.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:19.140
So everyone who owns land by definition

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.400
is a servant of the tsar,

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.980
and almost always that's military service.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.320
So this is the way the army is set up.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.720
You get to control land, but in return,

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.493
you serve in the army.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.530
That is the fundamental deal.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:35.463
You control land in exchange
for military service,

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.000
and I can break that at any point.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:41.100
So you're the fighting class,

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.710
but you're not exactly a nobility

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.350
in the sense of West European nobilities.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.960
There is no legal list,
there's no register,

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.940
there's no patent of nobility.

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.200
There's no beautiful piece of paper

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.647
which you can produce and say,

00:33:53.647 --> 00:33:56.340
"I have a better Latin script
than you," or whatever.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.560
You're not really nobles in the sense

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.750
of being a legal estate.

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:04.080
You're really nobles it more
or less at my at my pleasure.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.580
So there aren't property rights,

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.040
and there aren't really
feudal rights either.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.500
There's this deal, which
is a very effective deal.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.690
It works very well, a fighting class

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:14.070
in exchange for control of land.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.380
And of course it works very well,

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.170
so long as we're getting
more land all the time.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:20.970
And that's part of the
magic of the system.

00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:23.970
We are going to be getting
more land all the time

00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:25.631
for at least a couple of centuries.

00:34:25.631 --> 00:34:29.340
The state is going to grow spectacularly,

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.080
first west into Europe,

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.180
then south into formerly
Muslim territories,

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.190
and then west all the
way to the Pacific Ocean

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.320
in just a couple of centuries, okay.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.350
This is basically an
agrarian country though.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:45.350
So part of this system is serfdom.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:50.420
So you are off fighting wars,
but you have a land manager

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:54.120
and you have serfs on your territory.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.060
The Russian peasants live in communes.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.010
The word for commune, I forgot
to write this down, sorry,

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:00.870
is (speaking in Russian),
which is a very evocative

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:03.450
Russian word, 'cause it
also means world and peace,

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.820
which is practically a whole
universe of meaning, right?

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:09.750
So commune, peace and
world, all the same word.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.420
The right that the
peasants had in the system,

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:16.140
The one right, was to leave
and go somewhere else.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.730
So think about how this works.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.740
The peasants are in a commune.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.870
The commune is on the land of someone

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.280
who's in this warrior class.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.480
The person who's in the warrior class

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.310
is personally dependent upon the tsar.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:29.550
No way anywhere down in this hierarchy

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:32.220
does anyone really have
any kind of formal rights.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.440
The right that the
peasants have is to leave,

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.400
and the story of serfdom is
that that right is taken away.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.400
Beginning from 1497 through
let's say through 1649,

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.870
all of these rights are
completely taken away.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:51.600
So in 1497, I'm not gonna
tell the whole story,

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.600
but in 1497, you're right as peasants,

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:57.443
okay, I'll be the peasant.

00:35:57.443 --> 00:36:01.620
My right as a peasant to leave
is limited to one day a year.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.970
Okay, that's a restriction.

00:36:04.714 --> 00:36:08.010
And then in 1581, that day is taken away,

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:09.090
so it's now zero days.

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:12.510
And then from there, the law
escalates in the sense of,

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:16.020
the landowner has five years
to find you if you run away,

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.910
10 years to find you if you run away,

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.620
15 years to find you if you run away,

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:23.040
and serfdom is considered
to be complete by 1649,

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.010
when the landowner has
your whole life to find you

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.690
after you run away, right?

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:29.550
So at that point, there's no, like,

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.410
you can't even go
underground for 15 years.

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:34.020
You're a serf until you die.

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:38.010
So roughly 1% of the population

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.920
belongs to the service
class, or the fighting class.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:45.270
Most of the remaining 99% of
the population are peasants,

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.940
and most of these peasants
are bound to the land.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.670
So that's a system which has a logic.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:54.150
It's a system which has a
logic in which you can make,

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.520
you will do well if you're
in the fighting class,

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.350
if there was more land.

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:00.990
If you were a serf, the only
thing you can think about

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:03.750
is somehow escaping very far away,

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.370
and we're gonna get to
that before we're done.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:09.693
So territorial expansion,
there is a lot of it.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:14.550
Russia, so Muscovy I should say,

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.710
as soon as it comes into being,

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.390
as soon as it comes into being,

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.120
it instantly joins the
European age of discovery.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.410
That's one way to think about it, right?

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.600
So all these other places,
like the Netherlands,

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.060
or Portugal, or Spain,
or the Italian states,

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.350
they've been around for a while,

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.580
they've been doing other things.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.510
Muscovy comes into being,
and immediately, boom,

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:37.113
it's expanding territorially
on a tremendous scale.

00:37:38.007 --> 00:37:42.270
The Muscovy of 1533 is six times as big

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:46.020
as the Muscovy of 1462,
and that's just the start.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.110
So there are three waves of expansion.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:53.580
The first wave of expansion is
in Europe, and it's westward.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:58.080
So Moscow is pretty far east, right?

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.580
So these places we're
talking about, Moscow, Tver,

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.550
that was the extreme northeast of Rus'.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.100
It's very far east from the point of view

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.360
of Rus' or from Europe.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.350
The first move that Moscow
makes is to the west,

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.910
controlling in the 1470s, 1480s, 1490s,

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.990
the other cities that are Orthodox,

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.220
not necessarily from Rus',

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.010
the other cities that are
Orthodox that are to its West.

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.837
The most important of these is Novgorod.

00:38:27.837 --> 00:38:31.380
And Novgorod is an ancient city.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.770
Novgorod was a place where
many of the rulers of Rus'

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:37.200
ruled at some point in their careers.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.830
It was comparably important
to Rus' at some points.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.960
It was a very important trading state,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.960
but also it was a city which
was governed by its notables.

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:49.980
It had an assembly, right?

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:54.060
It wasn't a completely
vertical situation at all.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.090
This was true of Novgorod,
this was true of Pskov.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:59.460
These places, Novgorod, Pskov,

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.073
cities where there was freedom,

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:05.460
at least for what we now
call, like the bourgeoisie.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.350
Cities where there was assembly, right?

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:08.790
These cities had bells.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:10.830
This is a sort of charming, or uncharming,

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:12.000
or depressing detail.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.500
They would ring the bell,

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.350
which would mean the assembly should meet.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:18.930
But then symbolically, when
these cities were sacked

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:21.090
by Moscow and put under Muscovite control,

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.430
the bells would then
be ritually taken away.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:26.910
So in 1510, for example,
the bell from Pskov

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:29.280
was taken down and taken away,

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.460
and everyone knew what that meant.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.870
So 1470s, 1480s, 1490s,
early 16th century,

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.670
Ryazan falls in 1520.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:41.430
These are cities that
are similar culturally,

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:43.050
in the sense that they're Orthodox,

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:46.470
but these are not actually
necessarily cities of Rus'.

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:48.750
So just to, I'm banging
this idea across I know,

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:52.140
but Rus' kind of becomes
whatever you can make it be.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.690
People in Novgorod did not
think they were part of Rus'.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:56.730
But once you conquer it,
it then sort of becomes

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:58.650
part of Rus', because
everything you control,

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:00.300
you're going to call Rus'.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:05.300
So first chapter of expansion
is westward into these cities,

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.440
which were bigger, Novgorod
much bigger than Moscow.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.370
Bigger, more sophisticated,
richer than Moscow.

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:16.980
But once they are defeated by Moscow,

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.750
this is very important.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.210
Over time their elites
are humiliated, crushed,

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.820
dispersed, brought to
Moscow, made dependent,

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.630
and the system that I described
in Moscow is then applied.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.430
It takes generations, but is then applied

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:31.410
in these other cities, so that the people

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:35.460
who had been notables there
become servants of the tsar,

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.260
because there is no other status besides

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.090
servant of the tsar, which is available.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:40.920
There is resistance,
there is attempts to get

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.810
Lithuania to help, all
kinds of things happen.

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:45.330
But the basic story is
the people who had had

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:49.230
some kind of status of
their own in these cities

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:51.570
no longer have status of
their own under Moscow.

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.180
The Moscow system has spread west.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:59.130
Second stage is territorial
expansion south,

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:02.730
and this mostly takes place under Ivan IV,

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.910
who, the one who's known
as Ivan the Terrible,

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:06.990
although his name is really more

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:09.690
like threatening, or something like this.

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:14.373
But Ivan IV, who rules for a
very long time, 1547 to 1584.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:19.140
Here again, it's remarkable
how just as Moscow

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.110
comes into being, it is immediately,

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:24.150
it immediately begins to expand.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:29.150
So Ivan IV, he defeats the
Khanate of Kazan in 1552,

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.290
in the years after that.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:37.929
Kazan, it's today the third
biggest city, or maybe the,

00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:38.850
I think it's the third biggest city

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.740
in the Russian Federation
today, maybe the fourth.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.743
Major city, it's the capital
of what's now called Tatarstan.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:48.000
It's still Muslim, it's
still a Muslim place.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.940
Kazan is where, if you can
remember all the way back

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.880
to like a couple weeks ago,
this is where the Bulgars were.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:58.170
So like the Volga
Bulgars convert to Islam,

00:41:58.170 --> 00:41:59.460
they are under the Mongols.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.800
They're known as the Khanate of Kazan.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.180
They are conquered by Moscow in 1552.

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.927
And so if you're asking yourself,

00:42:07.927 --> 00:42:10.110
"Why are there Tatars in Russia today?

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:11.190
Who are these Tatars?"

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:12.057
This is who the Tatars are.

00:42:12.057 --> 00:42:13.200
The Tatars are the people

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.668
who were in the Khanate of Kazan,

00:42:15.668 --> 00:42:19.200
who were in Volga, Bulgaria.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.700
These are the people who are today

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.010
in Russia south of Moscow.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.680
So this defeat has a couple of meanings,

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.240
a couple of very important meanings.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.400
The first is Muscovy, you know,

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.070
basically not long after
it's come into existence

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.080
is already an empire, in the sense

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.600
that it is ruling people
of a different religion,

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.780
a lot of people of a
different religion, Muslims.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.400
Right away, right?

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.420
So not long after Moscow comes
into existence as a state,

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.360
it is already ruling
lots and lots of people

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.340
of a different religion than itself.

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:54.360
And that is a durable fact about
Moscow, the Russian Empire,

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:57.840
and for that matter, the
Russian Federation today.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.640
The second thing, which is
very important about this,

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:03.930
and I'm gonna return to
it, is that this opens up,

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:05.850
this opens up the Volga River

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:08.760
and the lands east of the Volga River,

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.100
which are generally known as Siberia.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.970
So from European Russia all
the way to the Pacific Ocean,

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:18.720
beautiful, rich territory,
lots of valuable things,

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.030
furs mainly.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.250
There are only about 200,000 people

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.530
living there at the time.

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:29.220
That is now, once the Khanate
of Kazan is destroyed,

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.600
that's all open.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:35.600
The last move of Ivan
though is to go back west

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.910
and begin the Livonian wars.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.400
Which don't worry, in two lectures

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.580
we're gonna spend a lot of
time on the Livonian wars.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.370
In the Livonian wars, Ivan is trying

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.560
to pick up the Baltic territories,

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.710
which were originally laid
down by the Teutonic Knights.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:55.170
The Teutonic Knights
convert to Lutheranism,

00:43:55.170 --> 00:44:00.170
they change their ways, they
build nice towns, they trade.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.790
And their realm starts to
fall apart, Moscow intervenes.

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:07.890
Moscow's intervention,
and we're gonna have

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.360
much of a lecture about this,

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.020
generates a Lithuanian
and a Polish response.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.610
This is the 1560s.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.100
The Lithuanian and Polish response

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.400
is to form the Polish
Lithuanian Commonwealth.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.080
And as we're gonna see,

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.450
it's the Polish Lithuanian
Commonwealth which actually

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:28.410
generates the conditions of
the thing that we call Ukraine.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:30.780
So in a weird way, it
was Ivan the Terrible

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:32.010
who's responsible for Ukraine,

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.020
So you know, we've heard
how it was, you know, Lenin,

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.070
we've heard how it was Hitler,

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:36.780
we've heard how it was
the gays and the Jews

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.060
and the European Union, but you know,

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.790
Ivan the Terrible actually
sets off the chain of events.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:43.500
Okay, don't worry, we'll develop all this.

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.050
But the thing to know here in this context

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.723
is that the Livonian wars don't go well.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.120
They go very badly, and
Ivan becomes quite paranoid

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:59.120
and carries out a whole series
of seriously weird purges,

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.890
to which one could
devote an entire lecture,

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:06.890
which involve a private
guard called the Oprechniki,

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.770
who go around with black hoods

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:15.540
and severed dogs heads or
wolf's heads on their horses,

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.570
and carry out purges, murderous purges

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:21.107
of the people who are
supposed to be traitors,

00:45:21.107 --> 00:45:25.830
a reign of terror all over Muscovy

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.650
in the 1560s and into the 1570s.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:30.720
All these cities, like
Novgorod for example,

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.670
are purged again, and in Novogorod

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:35.130
thousands of people are murdered.

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.110
This is the part of Ivan's rule,

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.510
which is why he's remembered
as Ivan the Terrible.

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:42.390
This, the paranoia, the purges.

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:46.050
And in this situation
where they're losing,

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:49.350
to pull in Lithuania, and there are,

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.390
these crazy purges are going on.

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:54.372
The Crimean Khanate, which still exists,

00:45:54.372 --> 00:45:56.760
Kazan Khanate gone, Crimean
Khanate still there.

00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:01.140
The Crimean Khanate invades and
almost takes Moscow in 1571.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:05.070
Okay, so at that point
Ivan, by the way, sobers up.

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.170
Sobers up, the purges slow down.

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.990
I didn't mean that in the alcoholic sense.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.213
He had many, he had many issues.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.460
But no, he seems to take
stock and the purges slow down

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:19.710
and then they make a truce

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.960
with Poland and Lithuania in 1582.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.150
But the other thing
that happens under Ivan,

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:25.860
which is what I'm gonna leave you with,

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.970
is the third direction of expansion,

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.470
which is actually global.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:34.710
So it's eastern, but it's actually global.

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:36.840
Getting it all the way
to the Pacific Ocean

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.160
is actually global.

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.870
Getting all the way to the Pacific Ocean,

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:42.180
starting around the same time you begin

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.880
trade with England, which was 1554.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.530
That was a total accident, by the way.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:48.150
The English were in the Arctic Ocean

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:49.773
looking for a passage to China,

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.340
which hint, hint, they didn't find.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.380
And all of the boats
capsized except for one,

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.600
but the one that didn't found Russia.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.897
And being merchants they said,

00:46:58.897 --> 00:47:00.510
"Oh, I bet these guys
have something to trade,"

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:01.470
and of course they did.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:04.380
And one of the things the
Russians had to trade was fur,

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:07.470
which was a hugely
important good at the time.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.900
And where do you get fur?
You get fur in Siberia.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.023
And so this is actually,
is that me? I'm sorry.

00:47:15.374 --> 00:47:18.120
So the global part of this is that Russia

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.460
is entering the global
economy on the Atlantic side

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:23.253
and on the Pacific side
at about the same time.

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:27.690
So the way that this works
in practice, very quickly,

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:31.170
is that the territory,
once the Kazan Khanate

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:33.510
has been defeated, this territory is open.

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:35.820
The Muscovites move in.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.280
The people that they
send are called Cossacks,

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.080
and a Cossack is basically a free person.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.460
We'll talk more about them.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.590
The Cossacks go and they conquer,

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.870
with the help of European weapons.

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:48.150
This is also a globalized element of this,

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:50.370
and it's why Russia is
part of the European

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:52.500
age of discovery, if
you like, at this point.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:56.160
They're using muskets, they're
using gun powder weapons,

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.380
and that's one of the reasons
why they're so successful.

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:01.320
They find lots of people
who they can oppress

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.980
and collect tribute from
in the form of beaver

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:08.610
and black fox, and especially sable pelts,

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:11.940
which are enormously
profitable at the time.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:16.080
They get their way across, they
move across all of Siberia.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.440
Very quickly, the first
expedition to the Pacific

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.576
is in 1639.

00:48:21.576 --> 00:48:26.576
A man called Semyon Dezhnev
crosses the Bering Strait.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:31.740
That is, he reaches
North America, in 1647.

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.830
So in a very, very short period of time,

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:37.170
a huge amount of territory, right?

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.810
An eighth, a ninth of the Earth's surface

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:42.450
is now under control of Moscow.

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:44.460
And that's not just a matter of territory,

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.470
it's also a matter of human variety.

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:49.710
There are roughly 500
groups in this territory,

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:52.110
speaking roughly 120 languages.

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:54.120
And many of these groups still exist,

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:55.650
and you can read about them in the news

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:58.920
as they're being mobilized
to fight in Ukraine.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.870
But it's also, as I've tried to stress,

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:03.810
it's globalization,
because Russia is trading

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.240
the Atlantic and the
Pacific at the same time.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.450
And finally, this is the very
last sentence, with China.

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:12.780
So one of the limits, one of
the few limits that Russia,

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:16.200
that Moscow reaches is with the Chinese.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.830
They reach, they sign a
peace treaty with China

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:24.660
in 1689 in Nerchinsk, which
establishes the border

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.490
between Muscovy and China.

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:29.730
But more importantly, it
establishes terms of trade

00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:32.460
between Muscovy and China
so that all those furs

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:35.760
can be traded to China for luxury goods.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:39.510
So the route to China, which the English

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:41.910
were trying to discover,
eventually does take place,

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:45.960
but by way of land rather
than by way of sea.

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.605
So this is the origins of Muscovite power.

00:49:49.605 --> 00:49:54.605
A new system, an enormous
amount of new territory,

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:59.010
and the success of
centralization in all of this.

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:01.890
What this has to do with
all of Rus', of course,

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:03.630
you know, is very fuzzy.

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:05.790
If I've gotten anything
across, I hope it's this,

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:08.490
that Rus' has many successors,

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:10.440
and we wouldn't want deny the connection

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.140
between Rus' to Galicia-Volhynia,
or to Lithuania,

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.770
or at the state that's founded in Moscow.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:21.270
But Moscow also has very much
to do with the Mongol period,

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:24.270
which lasts for so very much
longer there than elsewhere.

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:25.920
And it has very much to do with the fact

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.950
that its first moves when
it comes into existence,

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:33.420
are territorial expansion to
Europe, but mostly into Asia.

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.953
Okay, thank you very much.

00:50:38.403 --> 00:50:41.736
(bright chiming music)

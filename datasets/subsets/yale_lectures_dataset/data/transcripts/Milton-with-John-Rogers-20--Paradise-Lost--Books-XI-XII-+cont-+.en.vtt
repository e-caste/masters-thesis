00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.622
Professor John Rogers:
Samuel Johnson in The

00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:07.302
Life of Milton -- and that's
The Life of Milton

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:11.140
included in the packet,
but I've also included this on

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.772
the handout -- Dr.
Johnson wrote that Paradise

00:00:14.772 --> 00:00:19.160
Lost is one of those books
which the reader admires and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.490
lays down and forgets to pick up
again.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.487
We're used to this.
We've read enough Johnson to

00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:29.232
recognize characteristic
curmudgeon-liness when it comes

00:00:29.232 --> 00:00:32.844
to the subject of Milton,
but I think there's something

00:00:32.844 --> 00:00:36.252
to this idea that we forget to
take Paradise Lost up

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:40.122
again after we've lain it down,
because to say that Paradise

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:43.322
Lost is not exactly a
page-turner is simply to say

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:46.040
that we're already familiar with
the plot.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.325
We know, of course,
how the story ends,

00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:51.753
and there's nothing for us,
in terms of the plot at least,

00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:54.580
to anticipate with all that
much eagerness.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.780
Our foreknowledge of the
story's end works continually,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.446
I think, to reinforce our sense
of God's foreknowledge of the

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:07.224
end of the story.
Of course, foreknowledge of any

00:01:07.224 --> 00:01:10.682
kind makes the end seem
inevitable, and I think the

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:14.970
inevitability of an ending puts
Milton -- this idea puts Milton

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.672
in a terrible bind.
Any sense of the inevitability

00:01:18.672 --> 00:01:21.939
of the Fall really makes -- it
just makes hash,

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.847
it makes nonsense,
of the notion of any strong

00:01:25.847 --> 00:01:29.319
feeling of Adam's and Eve's free
will.

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.747
If we're disappointed with the
ending of Paradise

00:01:31.747 --> 00:01:34.650
Lost, then I think
it's safe to say that Milton,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.500
too, is deeply troubled by the
implications of an end.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.234
It's for all of these reasons
that we can say that Paradise

00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:48.653
Lost is obsessed with the
problem of its own

00:01:48.653 --> 00:01:52.655
ending.Now,
we remember that Milton had

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:57.659
devoted enormous sums of energy
as a young man in anticipating

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.454
his own end.
He was continually looking

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:03.823
ahead to the writing of a poem
that "aftertimes would not

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:07.133
willingly let die" -- you'll
remember that sentence from

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:09.539
The Reason of Church
Government.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.442
In the 1640s,
he looked ahead to a political

00:02:12.442 --> 00:02:15.961
future in which the reformed
government would usher in the

00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:18.370
reign of Christ at the end of
time,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.617
and his early poems are filled
with brief lyric narratives of

00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:26.267
anticipation.
I'll just enumerate a few of

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:27.939
those, or I'll remind you of
them.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.889
The Nativity Ode had
anticipated a few times the

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.854
apocalypse.
Comus had anticipated --

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:37.715
well, had anticipated the
apocalypse as well,

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:41.680
but it also anticipated the
eventual marriage of the Lady.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.336
"Lycidas" anticipated,
among so many other things,

00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:49.464
the undying fame of the poet.
Adam, too, in Books Eleven and

00:02:49.464 --> 00:02:53.673
Twelve -- Adam seems continually
to be anticipating an ending

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.479
like the speaker of The Nativity
Ode.

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.168
Adam's always looking ahead to
the Christian millennium,

00:03:00.168 --> 00:03:03.468
or the apocalypse.
He's jumping ahead of himself,

00:03:03.468 --> 00:03:07.060
and Michael is always chiding
him for this enthusiasm.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.947
It's as if Michael's job is to
put the brakes on Adam's

00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:15.748
anticipatory
excitement.Given that role

00:03:15.748 --> 00:03:19.706
that Michael plays,
I think it's all the more

00:03:19.706 --> 00:03:24.211
remarkable that it's Michael --
this is our killjoy archangel

00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:28.641
who's often just as bad as Adam
in his own eagerness to jump

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:32.470
ahead of himself as he tells the
story –

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.641
that it's Michael himself is
the angel of apocalypse from the

00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:39.770
Book of Revelation,
as we learned from David's

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.172
lecture on Friday.
The Book of Revelation is the

00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:46.206
book from which Milton has
taken, or has lifted,

00:03:46.206 --> 00:03:47.949
this character,
Michael.

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:52.069
Perhaps because of his role in
Revelation, the Michael of

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.041
Paradise Lost seems
incapable of keeping himself

00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:59.720
from the onrush of expectation
as he narrates,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.391
in what I suppose should be
chronological order but isn't,

00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:08.987
the story of future history.
So Michael will narrate the

00:04:08.987 --> 00:04:13.816
story of the apocalypse four --
count them, four -- times over

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:18.596
the course of the last books,
once in Book Eleven and three

00:04:18.596 --> 00:04:22.047
times in Book Twelve.
In all of his eagerness to

00:04:22.047 --> 00:04:26.349
imagine the final fulfillment of
history, Michael seems almost in

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.709
some way to be parodying
Milton's own tendency,

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:33.883
especially his own youthful
tendency, to offer those

00:04:33.883 --> 00:04:37.730
prophetic narratives of
anticipation.Now,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.378
Michael's focus in the last two
books is essentially on God's

00:04:43.378 --> 00:04:48.839
providential control over the
actions of the descendants of

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:53.191
Adam and Eve,
and so it's not too difficult

00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:58.790
to see why these books just
structurally are so troubling.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.724
Milton is in the incredibly
awkward position of trying to

00:05:02.724 --> 00:05:06.870
reconcile divine providence with
the notion of free will.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.946
This has been his challenge all
along, and this is also the

00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:12.811
subject of a lot of Milton's
musings in the theological

00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:15.569
treatise that he wrote at the
same time that he wrote

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.761
Paradise Lost,
The Christian Doctrine. I'm

00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:25.320
going to have you turn in your
Hughes to page 984 in

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.856
The Christian Doctrine.
Milton devotes an entire

00:05:29.856 --> 00:05:33.307
chapter to the problem of the
seeming incompatibility of

00:05:33.307 --> 00:05:35.879
divine providence and human free
will,

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.316
and he finds himself
continually knocking up against

00:05:39.316 --> 00:05:43.022
the representation of the
providential God that he finds

00:05:43.022 --> 00:05:46.930
in the Bible.So this is
Christian Doctrine,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.872
page 984.
This is where Milton tries to

00:05:49.872 --> 00:05:54.474
carve out a space for free will
in the face of so much contrary

00:05:54.474 --> 00:05:58.028
evidence in scripture.
This is on the top of the

00:05:58.028 --> 00:06:01.764
right-hand column.
I believe this is -- yes,

00:06:01.764 --> 00:06:04.829
this is also on the handout.
Okay.

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:08.517
Milton's speaking about divine
providence, which is obviously

00:06:08.517 --> 00:06:10.730
on some level a sensitive
subject,

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.957
maybe a sore subject,
for such a strong believer in

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.505
human free will.
He's quoting here the

00:06:16.505 --> 00:06:20.462
scriptural accounts of what he
calls the voluntary actions of

00:06:20.462 --> 00:06:23.501
the deity,
those moments in which God is

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:26.509
acting out of his own
inscrutable will.

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:31.860
So here we have Milton writing
very systematically:

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.970
Voluntary actions.
2 Chronicles x.15.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.144
[This is an example.]
so the king harkened not unto

00:06:38.144 --> 00:06:40.620
the people: for the cause was of
God.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.867
[And then again from Proverbs.]
…a man's heart deviseth

00:06:43.867 --> 00:06:47.650
his way;
but Jehovah directeth his steps.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.190
[And]…
man's goings are of Jehovah.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.189
[And]
…the king's heart is at

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:55.759
the hand of Jehovah as the
rivers of water;

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:58.519
he turneth it whithersoever he
will.

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:01.252
[And this from Jeremiah]
…O Jehovah,

00:07:01.252 --> 00:07:04.699
I know that the way of man is
not in himself.

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:09.350
Now, why [laughs]
would Milton do this?

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.480
Why would he cite these
scriptures?

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.857
From Milton's point of view,
and actually from the point of

00:07:15.857 --> 00:07:18.769
view of a lot of
seventeenth-century Christians,

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:22.711
these would have to be
bone-chilling statements of the

00:07:22.711 --> 00:07:25.759
absolute divine control over our
lives.

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:29.560
The verses from scripture that
Milton's quoting here seem to

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.700
admit of nothing like free will;
they conjure an image of God

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.740
who controls us as a puppeteer
would control his puppets,

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.146
and surely this has to make
Milton nervous.After quoting

00:07:41.146 --> 00:07:43.860
instances of divine action that
seem clearly,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.834
I think, to counter the idea of
the power of human free will,

00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:51.820
Milton adds this.
It's utterly sublime:

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.112
"In this, however,
there is no infringement on the

00:07:55.112 --> 00:07:59.298
liberty of the human will;
otherwise man would be deprived

00:07:59.298 --> 00:08:02.699
of the power of free agency..."
[laughs]

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:05.423
"Otherwise":
[laughs]

00:08:05.423 --> 00:08:14.139
it's slightly loose logic but
it's extraordinarily heartfelt.

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:17.935
Milton is telling us once again
that "it has to mean what I know

00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:20.879
it should mean."
It wouldn't make sense

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:24.188
otherwise.
So he faces head on the most

00:08:24.188 --> 00:08:28.022
recalcitrant passages of the
Bible, and he simply forces them

00:08:28.022 --> 00:08:30.449
to mean what he needs them to
mean.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:33.378
This is precisely the challenge
that Milton is confronted with

00:08:33.378 --> 00:08:36.859
in Books Eleven and Twelve.
The Bible had already written

00:08:36.859 --> 00:08:41.039
the story of man after the Fall,
and for most of Eleven and

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.475
Twelve,
Milton is really forced to

00:08:43.475 --> 00:08:46.905
amplify -- he's pretty
constrained here -- to amplify

00:08:46.905 --> 00:08:50.929
and elaborate on the chapters in
Genesis -- this is chapters 4

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:54.294
through 11 in the Book of
Genesis--that really speed

00:08:54.294 --> 00:08:57.658
through generations of
experience in the course of a

00:08:57.658 --> 00:09:01.380
few pages.Now,
the most important biblical

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.477
text to my mind that Milton has
to confront is the Genesis

00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:09.302
account of the expulsion.
This is the moment at which

00:09:09.302 --> 00:09:13.129
Adam and Eve are actually forced
to lose their paradise,

00:09:13.129 --> 00:09:15.356
and this is,
of course, the moment that's

00:09:15.356 --> 00:09:18.639
heralded -- the loss that's
heralded in the poem's title;

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:22.454
and so I think we have to
assume that this moment has a

00:09:22.454 --> 00:09:25.210
privileged position in Milton's
poem.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.066
This is the text as it appears
in Genesis, and I've also

00:09:29.066 --> 00:09:32.652
included this on the handout.
This is all we learn about the

00:09:32.652 --> 00:09:36.330
expulsion from Genesis:
And the Lord God said,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:41.241
Behold, the man is become as
one of us, to know good and

00:09:41.241 --> 00:09:44.894
evil: and now,
lest he put forth his hand,

00:09:44.894 --> 00:09:48.215
and take also of the tree of
life, and eat,

00:09:48.215 --> 00:09:49.639
and live for ever:

00:09:50.429 --> 00:09:53.953
Therefore the Lord God
sent him forth from the garden

00:09:53.953 --> 00:09:57.659
of Eden, to till the ground from
whence he was taken.

00:09:57.659 --> 00:10:01.120
So he drove out the
man…

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.711
By any standard,
I think, that we could

00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:09.719
comfortably identify as
Miltonic, this text portrays a

00:10:09.719 --> 00:10:13.618
God that's unjustifiable.
We've seen this argument

00:10:13.618 --> 00:10:16.552
before, though.
You'll remember Satan -- Satan

00:10:16.552 --> 00:10:20.659
had accused God of jealousy when
Satan was tempting Eve.

00:10:20.659 --> 00:10:23.338
Satan was telling Eve,
"God doesn't want you to eat

00:10:23.338 --> 00:10:26.391
the fruit because he doesn't
want you to become a god like

00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:28.759
him,
a being with the superior

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:32.501
knowledge of good and evil."
And we, of course,

00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:37.391
rally to dismiss Satan's claim
as yet another example of his

00:10:37.391 --> 00:10:41.436
tendency to lie and to deceive;
but Satan is [laughs]

00:10:41.436 --> 00:10:45.000
-- it seems that Milton's Satan
has only gotten this idea from

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.980
the words of God and the Book of
Genesis itself.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.664
What kind of god does Genesis
portray here if not that of a

00:10:51.664 --> 00:10:53.570
vulnerable and,
in some way,

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:59.298
desperate deity who does in
fact punish man out of a degree

00:10:59.298 --> 00:11:03.149
of jealousy and maybe even
vengeance?

00:11:03.149 --> 00:11:07.266
God here has to force Adam and
Eve out of the garden to keep

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:11.453
them from encroaching on any
more of his privileges or of his

00:11:11.453 --> 00:11:14.944
territory,
to keep them from achieving the

00:11:14.944 --> 00:11:19.729
state of immortality that only
God himself enjoys.Now as

00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:23.494
you can imagine,
this biblical passage has been

00:11:23.494 --> 00:11:27.276
troubling to generations of
readers of the Bible and

00:11:27.276 --> 00:11:31.157
especially biblical scholars.
The sixteenth-century

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:34.245
theologian Calvin,
when confronted with this

00:11:34.245 --> 00:11:38.481
passage, was really forced to
conclude that God was speaking

00:11:38.481 --> 00:11:43.220
ironically here -- he doesn't
actually mean what he's saying.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.635
Well, you have to say something
when you're dealing with a

00:11:46.635 --> 00:11:49.091
passage like this,
but Milton's incredibly

00:11:49.091 --> 00:11:53.551
scrupulous here.
He feels compelled to reproduce

00:11:53.551 --> 00:12:00.179
this very dark Genesis text in
his own story of the expulsion.

00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:02.786
Look at Book Eleven of
Paradise Lost,

00:12:02.786 --> 00:12:07.024
line ninety-three.
In the Hughes Edition

00:12:07.024 --> 00:12:11.860
it's page 435.
This is God speaking: 

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.340
Lest therefore his now
bolder hand

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.710
Reach also of the Tree of Life,
and eat,

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.830
And live for ever,
dream at least to live

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.769
For ever, to remove him I
decree,

00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:29.389
And send him from the Garden
forth to Till

00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:34.432
The Ground whence he was taken,
[and this is mean,]

00:12:34.432 --> 00:12:38.106
fitter soil.
Milton depicts a god in this

00:12:38.106 --> 00:12:41.419
passage who has all of those,
and maybe even then some,

00:12:41.419 --> 00:12:44.558
[laughs]
anthropomorphic qualities of

00:12:44.558 --> 00:12:47.610
the Yahweh of so much of
Genesis.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:52.353
God here is distinctly human in
personality, and he's able

00:12:52.353 --> 00:12:57.013
without hesitation to intervene
in the lives of -- in the

00:12:57.013 --> 00:13:00.925
affairs of man in order to
effect his desire for

00:13:00.925 --> 00:13:04.187
punishment.
I take this to be precisely a

00:13:04.187 --> 00:13:07.692
type of god that Milton is
trying to counteract or to do

00:13:07.692 --> 00:13:11.580
away with throughout so much of
The Christian Doctrine,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.688
a god whose
all-encompassing will just

00:13:14.688 --> 00:13:17.570
steamrolls right over the free
will,

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.643
the free agency,
of human individuals.But

00:13:20.643 --> 00:13:25.043
nonetheless we have this passage
in the poem and you can -- it's

00:13:25.043 --> 00:13:29.374
not hard to see that the moment
of expulsion is a crisis moment

00:13:29.374 --> 00:13:33.577
in Paradise Lost.
It's not only that point at

00:13:33.577 --> 00:13:37.418
which paradise gets lost;
it's also that moment,

00:13:37.418 --> 00:13:42.098
I think, in which Milton is
most hard pressed to depict a

00:13:42.098 --> 00:13:45.190
god whose actions are
justifiable,

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.399
whose behavior can be
reconciled with all of the

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:51.950
claims of reason that Milton
wants to hold him to.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.178
It's because the moment of the
actual expulsion is such a

00:13:56.178 --> 00:13:59.877
crisis that Milton provides us
with an alternative

00:13:59.877 --> 00:14:03.608
understanding of it,
and this, I believe,

00:14:03.608 --> 00:14:09.077
is the conversation between the
Father and the Son at line

00:14:09.077 --> 00:14:14.779
forty-five of Book Eleven,
page 434 of the Hughes.

00:14:14.779 --> 00:14:18.516
The Son has just pleaded
with the Father to show some

00:14:18.516 --> 00:14:22.320
mercy on the repentant Adam and
Eve and the Father -- it's

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.190
wonderful -- argues that he
would like,

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.760
in fact he'd love,
to be merciful,

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.759
but there are some things that
are simply out of his control.

00:14:29.759 --> 00:14:33.949
Adam and Eve will have to leave
the garden, and the

00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:39.311
justification that God gives for
their departure I think is truly

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:42.913
extraordinary.
So this is line forty-eight of

00:14:42.913 --> 00:14:45.916
Book Eleven:
But longer in that

00:14:45.916 --> 00:14:51.175
Paradise to dwell,
The Law I gave to Nature him

00:14:51.175 --> 00:14:53.948
forbids:
Those pure immortal Elements

00:14:53.948 --> 00:14:56.699
that know
No gross, no unharmonious

00:14:56.699 --> 00:15:00.307
mixture foul,
Eject him tainted now,

00:15:00.307 --> 00:15:04.130
and purge him off
As a distemper,

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.620
gross to air as
gross…

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.787
And we suddenly have a
rationale for the expulsion

00:15:11.787 --> 00:15:15.860
that's really completely opposed
to the account of the expulsion

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.740
that begins at line ninety-three
and completely opposed,

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.720
of course, to its original in
the Book of Genesis.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.960
Where did Milton get this?
He's made this up.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.903
Suddenly Milton has a god
behaving really very

00:15:30.903 --> 00:15:33.047
differently.
God is saying,

00:15:33.047 --> 00:15:35.929
"Well, I'd love for them to
stay in paradise,

00:15:35.929 --> 00:15:38.549
but you see there's nothing I
can do.

00:15:38.549 --> 00:15:42.955
I established this natural law
in Eden whereby the pure,

00:15:42.955 --> 00:15:46.480
immortal elements of paradise
necessarily,

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.620
inexorably expel and purge
anything that's foul or tainted;

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.608
and because,
of course, the fallen bodies of

00:15:53.608 --> 00:15:55.690
Adam and Eve are actually foul
and tainted,

00:15:55.690 --> 00:16:00.999
the atmospheric mechanisms
already in place in paradise are

00:16:00.999 --> 00:16:05.576
in the process as we speak of
purging them from the

00:16:05.576 --> 00:16:11.159
garden."The lines are
beautiful and they're shocking.

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:15.940
Milton puts in God's mouth an
explanation for the expulsion of

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.329
Adam and Eve that really
deliberately runs counter to the

00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:23.700
explanation in the Book of
Genesis and,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.000
I think, completely contradicts
the one that God himself had

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.936
given so publicly to the
assembly of angels about fifty

00:16:31.936 --> 00:16:35.297
or so lines later.
It's an explanation that

00:16:35.297 --> 00:16:39.690
completely counters the image of
the jealous and vengeful God

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:42.620
that Milton inherited from
scripture.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.597
Milton is really wresting this
poem away from its source in

00:16:46.597 --> 00:16:50.779
scripture and he's pushing it
toward an entirely new genre.

00:16:50.779 --> 00:16:54.111
This is something much closer
to what we would think of as

00:16:54.111 --> 00:16:55.690
science fiction,
I think,

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:59.813
than any kind of
anthropomorphic biblical

00:16:59.813 --> 00:17:05.069
narrative.Milton is taking a
tremendous risk,

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.489
and to embark on such a
fanciful flight of myth-making

00:17:08.489 --> 00:17:12.038
at such an incredibly important
moment has to be seen as

00:17:12.038 --> 00:17:15.750
consequential.
I think that Milton is taking

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.444
this risk for the purposes of
his theodicy,

00:17:19.444 --> 00:17:23.490
his need to justify the ways of
God to men.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:28.982
Here at last is an image of the
god who expels Adam and Eve from

00:17:28.982 --> 00:17:34.039
the garden for an entirely
justifiable, rational reason.

00:17:34.039 --> 00:17:37.435
Here at last is an image of a
god who's not at all the evil

00:17:37.435 --> 00:17:40.539
puppeteer who deliberately
forces the movements of his

00:17:40.539 --> 00:17:44.038
human creatures.
It's an entirely benign -- it's

00:17:44.038 --> 00:17:48.543
almost an impersonal -- god who
willingly subjects himself to

00:17:48.543 --> 00:17:50.944
the law,
to the law of nature,

00:17:50.944 --> 00:17:54.845
and to the natural moral
processes of nature that are

00:17:54.845 --> 00:17:58.220
inevitably at work in the
garden.This,

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:03.507
of course, isn't the first time
that we've encountered the force

00:18:03.507 --> 00:18:06.779
of contradiction in Paradise
Lost.

00:18:06.779 --> 00:18:10.157
Throughout the poem,
Milton has been opposing

00:18:10.157 --> 00:18:13.886
competing notions of God,
opposing accounts of crucial

00:18:13.886 --> 00:18:16.154
events.
You'll remember Raphael's

00:18:16.154 --> 00:18:19.264
account of creation in Book
Seven in which Milton had

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:22.216
opposed the literal,
the anthropomorphic,

00:18:22.216 --> 00:18:26.315
story of Genesis with his own
really wildly original,

00:18:26.315 --> 00:18:30.492
incredibly beautiful story of
something like a natural

00:18:30.492 --> 00:18:34.068
self-creation.
There are two accounts,

00:18:34.068 --> 00:18:38.677
as I mentioned in the last
class, of Noah's flood in

00:18:38.677 --> 00:18:43.869
Michael's own history lesson.
Events are continually being

00:18:43.869 --> 00:18:49.289
related twice and sometimes even
three times in Paradise Lost,

00:18:49.289 --> 00:18:52.548
and the purpose of these
narrative repetitions,

00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:56.393
I think, has nothing to do with
Milton's desire to make this

00:18:56.393 --> 00:18:59.000
poem impenetrable or just
confusing.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.710
Milton is on something like a
systematic level,

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:07.711
I think, juxtaposing the poem's
official theological reading of

00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:12.228
events with an alternative --
what we could think of as a

00:19:12.228 --> 00:19:17.230
naturalistic or maybe a more
rational reading of events.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.788
He's struggling to represent a
more palatable,

00:19:20.788 --> 00:19:24.268
a more rational,
alternative to the arbitrary

00:19:24.268 --> 00:19:29.014
anthropomorphic deity who is so
capable of jealousy and these

00:19:29.014 --> 00:19:32.889
all-too-human motives that he
finds in the Book of

00:19:32.889 --> 00:19:37.160
Genesis.Up to this point in
Milton's poem,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.059
we really haven't known what to
do with a lot of these conflicts

00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:46.569
and contradictions that the poem
was presenting us with.

00:19:46.569 --> 00:19:50.451
Conflicting accounts of key
moments in Christian history

00:19:50.451 --> 00:19:54.049
just seemed to be held in
suspension in the text.

00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:58.444
It's often difficult to discern
how we're supposed to interpret

00:19:58.444 --> 00:20:02.910
the relation between opposing
views, or among opposing views.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.738
I think this is a problem that
we've been confronting all

00:20:05.738 --> 00:20:08.819
along: is one version right and
the other version is wrong?

00:20:08.819 --> 00:20:11.720
Is one version a satanic
perspective on these events and

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.764
the other is a divine view?
What's the point of all of

00:20:14.764 --> 00:20:17.094
these oppositions and
conflicts?Well,

00:20:17.094 --> 00:20:19.890
if those are the questions that
we're asking,

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.844
it's safe to say that Milton in
his magnificent genius has

00:20:23.844 --> 00:20:26.480
already anticipated those
questions.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.998
I think here in the last books
of the poem, Milton is

00:20:30.998 --> 00:20:36.212
struggling, and to some effect,
to make some kind of sense of

00:20:36.212 --> 00:20:40.118
this problem.
Michael presents a theory of

00:20:40.118 --> 00:20:44.714
reading that on some level can
account for some of the

00:20:44.714 --> 00:20:49.310
confusions of Paradise
Lost: it's the theory of

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:53.559
scriptural interpretation known
as typology,

00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:56.019
and it had been around for
centuries.

00:20:56.019 --> 00:20:59.309
According to the typological
interpretation of Christian

00:20:59.309 --> 00:21:02.480
history, characters and events
in the Hebrew Bible,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.382
which Christians called the Old
Testament, are seen as types of

00:21:07.382 --> 00:21:10.940
characters and events in the New
Testament.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.740
This mode of reading became a
way for Christian readers of the

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.450
Bible to reinterpret everything
in the Hebrew scriptures,

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.082
and to appropriate the Hebrew
scriptures, as an anticipation

00:21:20.082 --> 00:21:23.099
of the Christian truths that
would be revealed,

00:21:23.099 --> 00:21:28.390
they believed,
later in the gospel.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.985
This was a central way in which
Christians could assert some

00:21:32.985 --> 00:21:37.424
kind of superiority over Judaism
in light of the fact that

00:21:37.424 --> 00:21:41.318
Judaism had this awkward but
nonetheless incredibly

00:21:41.318 --> 00:21:45.446
significant temporal priority
over Christianity.So

00:21:45.446 --> 00:21:50.608
typology becomes a big deal.
Look at Milton's dealing with

00:21:50.608 --> 00:21:54.431
the typological perspective in
Paradise Lost,

00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:56.789
Book Twelve,
line 312.

00:21:56.789 --> 00:22:00.250
This is page 461 in the
Hughes.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.499
Milton looks at the Old
Testament figure of Joshua --

00:22:03.499 --> 00:22:07.800
and he's not making this up.
There's a long tradition of

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.500
thinking of Joshua as a type of
Jesus.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.092
Joshua represents in this
reading an early version of the

00:22:16.092 --> 00:22:19.700
Jesus that Christians come to
call Christ,

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.143
and the full significance of
Joshua's life can't have been

00:22:23.143 --> 00:22:26.466
revealed in his own lifetime or
actually during anyone's

00:22:26.466 --> 00:22:30.416
lifetime in the Old Testament.
The full significance of the

00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:34.481
Old Testament type isn't known
until the emergence of the New

00:22:34.481 --> 00:22:38.085
Testament anti-type,
the anti-type being the

00:22:38.085 --> 00:22:41.910
Christian fulfillment of the
Hebraic type.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.269
In this case,
the anti-type is the birth of

00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:47.618
Jesus.
Christian exegetes were

00:22:47.618 --> 00:22:52.298
constantly mapping out elaborate
systems of types and anti-types

00:22:52.298 --> 00:22:56.511
as they read the Bible.
There's a very interesting book

00:22:56.511 --> 00:22:59.970
on Milton's use of typology by
William Madsen,

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:04.269
M-a-d-s-e-n,
called From Shadowy Types to

00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:09.569
Truth.Look a little
further up on page 461.

00:23:09.569 --> 00:23:15.369
This is Michael's actual theory
of typology, line 300 of Book

00:23:15.369 --> 00:23:18.274
Twelve.
In the typological view of

00:23:18.274 --> 00:23:22.420
history, true meaning emerges
over time by means of an

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.706
historical process,
and this is how Michael

00:23:25.706 --> 00:23:30.013
articulates it:
So Law appears imperfet

00:23:30.013 --> 00:23:33.869
[and by law Michael means mosaic
law, the

00:23:33.869 --> 00:23:38.387
law dispensed on Mount Sinai in
the Old Testament]

00:23:38.387 --> 00:23:41.907
and but giv'n
With purpose to resign them in

00:23:41.907 --> 00:23:44.660
full time
Up to a better Cov'nant,

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:48.132
disciplin'd
From shadowy Types to Truth,

00:23:48.132 --> 00:23:51.927
from Flesh to Spirit,
From imposition of strict Laws,

00:23:51.927 --> 00:23:54.832
to free
Acceptance of large Grace,

00:23:54.832 --> 00:23:59.635
from servile fear
To filial, works of Law to

00:23:59.635 --> 00:24:03.771
works of Faith.
Christian history obeys a

00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:07.172
process whereby the shadowy
types of the Old Testament are

00:24:07.172 --> 00:24:10.215
eventually revealed in all of
their truth in the New

00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:13.250
Testament.
Old Testament law gives way to

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.889
New Testament faith,
and the laws of the flesh start

00:24:16.889 --> 00:24:20.599
to yield to something like a
faith in the spirit.

00:24:20.599 --> 00:24:23.907
That's the message here,
and Michael presents this with

00:24:23.907 --> 00:24:26.602
the official theological
understanding of the

00:24:26.602 --> 00:24:28.930
significance of Christian
history.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:32.810
This is really the official
doctrine of the revelation of

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.898
all of the types and anti-types
that Michael has given us in

00:24:36.898 --> 00:24:40.917
this whirlwind history of life
after the Fall.Michael's

00:24:40.917 --> 00:24:46.049
also doing a lot more than that.
Michael's theory of reading

00:24:46.049 --> 00:24:50.492
biblical history,
I think, is also something like

00:24:50.492 --> 00:24:54.009
a theory of reading this very
poem.

00:24:54.009 --> 00:24:56.764
He's giving us an
interpretative key,

00:24:56.764 --> 00:25:01.431
I submit, to some of the most
difficult aspects of Paradise

00:25:01.431 --> 00:25:04.320
Lost.
The history of civilization

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.226
that Michael offers us is filled
with moments of seeming

00:25:08.226 --> 00:25:10.836
repetition.
Joshua appears in the Old

00:25:10.836 --> 00:25:14.456
Testament, but he seems to point
ahead to the new Joshua,

00:25:14.456 --> 00:25:18.614
Jesus, in the New Testament.
These typological repetitions

00:25:18.614 --> 00:25:21.957
are closely related,
I think, to the narrative

00:25:21.957 --> 00:25:25.299
repetitions that we have in
Milton's poem,

00:25:25.299 --> 00:25:29.109
narrative repetitions like the
competing accounts of the

00:25:29.109 --> 00:25:32.849
creation or the competing
accounts of the expulsion.

00:25:32.849 --> 00:25:34.519
These are things that we've
looked at.

00:25:34.519 --> 00:25:37.814
And the theory of typology
works to make sense,

00:25:37.814 --> 00:25:40.964
on some level,
of some of the differences and

00:25:40.964 --> 00:25:44.903
some of the conflicts among
these repeated narratives in

00:25:44.903 --> 00:25:49.089
Milton's story.Now,
we have been confused.

00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:52.959
We may have been confused about
what to do with the poem's

00:25:52.959 --> 00:25:57.099
competing accounts of various
moments of Christian history.

00:25:57.099 --> 00:26:00.180
This is where the theory of
typology comes in.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.520
The old-fashioned
anthropomorphic images of the

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.877
deity, the images that Milton
inherits in large part from the

00:26:07.877 --> 00:26:11.342
text of Genesis,
begin to look like shadowy

00:26:11.342 --> 00:26:14.980
types, the shadowy types of the
Old Testament.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.414
The more modern,
what we could think of as

00:26:17.414 --> 00:26:19.670
something like the
quasi-scientific,

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.509
rational explanation in the
poem of certain events begins to

00:26:23.509 --> 00:26:27.609
emerge as something like a type
of -- as a new kind of truth.

00:26:27.609 --> 00:26:31.519
The shadowy types of Milton's
scriptural literalism -- and

00:26:31.519 --> 00:26:35.703
there's no question that that's
an important component of this

00:26:35.703 --> 00:26:40.230
poem -- maybe they yield to the
truths of the more scientific,

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.478
the more naturalistic side of
Milton's imagination.It's

00:26:43.478 --> 00:26:46.783
not exactly the case that one
version is wrong and the other

00:26:46.783 --> 00:26:49.747
version is right.
We could think of one version

00:26:49.747 --> 00:26:52.704
as being an early,
literalist understanding of an

00:26:52.704 --> 00:26:56.104
event and the other as a later,
more rational,

00:26:56.104 --> 00:27:00.669
more sophisticated
understanding of an event -- an

00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:06.165
entirely natural as opposed to a
supernatural account of the

00:27:06.165 --> 00:27:11.314
forces at work in the world.
I think you can see Milton

00:27:11.314 --> 00:27:15.782
inviting just this type of
typological reading of his own

00:27:15.782 --> 00:27:20.170
poem at the conclusion of
Paradise Lost.Let's

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:24.877
look at the poem's final simile
and just take a moment to be

00:27:24.877 --> 00:27:29.903
grateful that Milton has decided
to give us a final simile after

00:27:29.903 --> 00:27:33.334
all of [laughs]
what we've been through with

00:27:33.334 --> 00:27:35.170
Michael.
Okay.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:41.025
This is line 625 of Book
Twelve, page 468 in the

00:27:41.025 --> 00:27:44.332
Hughes.
Now we've already had two

00:27:44.332 --> 00:27:47.269
anticipatory narratives of the
expulsion so far,

00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:49.519
and I'll just remind you of
them.

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:53.861
In the literalist narrative,
God explains that the expulsion

00:27:53.861 --> 00:27:58.350
will occur by means of Michael's
actually shoving Adam and Eve

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.990
out of the garden;
but you'll remember also that

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:05.265
more naturalistic,
that quasi-scientific version

00:28:05.265 --> 00:28:09.097
of the story in which God
explains that Adam and Eve are

00:28:09.097 --> 00:28:12.929
going to be ejected out of Eden
by means of some certain

00:28:12.929 --> 00:28:17.215
atmospheric pressures.
Here at the end of the poem,

00:28:17.215 --> 00:28:21.827
we have what I take to be the
actual representation of the

00:28:21.827 --> 00:28:25.246
real event.
This is taking place on the

00:28:25.246 --> 00:28:30.156
literal level at the present
moment of the story and on the

00:28:30.156 --> 00:28:34.390
literal level of the Genesis
account, line 625.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:39.111
[F]or now too nigh
Th' Arch-Angel stood,

00:28:39.111 --> 00:28:43.082
and from the other Hill
To thir fixt Station,

00:28:43.082 --> 00:28:46.230
all in bright array
The Cherubim

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:50.333
descended…
So you have these

00:28:50.333 --> 00:28:55.236
anthropomorphic beings,
the cherubim -- these angels,

00:28:55.236 --> 00:29:00.988
these armed angels descend to
earth to effect God's punishment

00:29:00.988 --> 00:29:04.405
of man;
but no sooner has Milton given

00:29:04.405 --> 00:29:08.748
us this literal Genesis-based
description of the expulsion

00:29:08.748 --> 00:29:13.472
than he embarks for a final time
on a simile that really throws

00:29:13.472 --> 00:29:17.510
everything that he's just
written into question.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.200
The cherubim have descended.
They're: 

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.796
[O]n the ground
Gliding meteorous [meteorous is

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:28.839
"like a meter"]
as Ev'ning Mist

00:29:28.839 --> 00:29:32.890
Ris'n from a River o'er the
marish glides,

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:36.570
And gathers ground fast at the
Laborer's heel

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:42.173
Homeward returning.
Pay attention to what Milton is

00:29:42.173 --> 00:29:45.804
doing here.
He's juxtaposing the descent of

00:29:45.804 --> 00:29:50.299
the angels with the ascent of
the rising mist.

00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:56.066
The angels who are "gliding
meteorous" are being likened to

00:29:56.066 --> 00:30:00.640
the mist that's rising and that
also glides.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.911
Through this antithesis he
signals, I think,

00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:08.173
to the reader that there are
something like two competing

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:12.662
perspectives on this horrible
but consequential event of the

00:30:12.662 --> 00:30:15.305
expulsion.
There's the literalist,

00:30:15.305 --> 00:30:18.402
the anthropomorphic image of
the descending angels,

00:30:18.402 --> 00:30:21.934
and then you have something
like the naturalistic image of

00:30:21.934 --> 00:30:25.837
the vapors and the mists of Eden
that will eject Adam and Eve by

00:30:25.837 --> 00:30:28.750
means of a kind of atmospheric
reaction.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.682
It's as if God's expulsion of
Adam and Eve from the garden

00:30:32.682 --> 00:30:36.890
were such a terrible event --
and certainly it is for us after

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:41.168
our many weeks-long investment
now in Milton's story of Eden --

00:30:41.168 --> 00:30:44.686
so terrible that Milton is
compelled to suggest some

00:30:44.686 --> 00:30:48.964
explanation of it that actually
absolves God of any jealousy or

00:30:48.964 --> 00:30:52.933
any vengeance,
any of those things that the

00:30:52.933 --> 00:30:56.900
Genesis account invites us to
attribute to God.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:01.078
You can see Milton struggling
to make this event more

00:31:01.078 --> 00:31:05.872
compatible with his theodicy,
more compatible with what we

00:31:05.872 --> 00:31:10.970
can think of as the naturalistic
side of his imagination.So

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:15.410
where has Milton taken us in
this beautiful simile?

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:20.417
Here at the end of Book Twelve,
he's returned us to one of the

00:31:20.417 --> 00:31:24.029
most beautiful similes of the
entire poem.

00:31:24.029 --> 00:31:28.142
That was the simile with which
he had ended Book One of

00:31:28.142 --> 00:31:31.285
Paradise Lost.
The beginning of

00:31:31.285 --> 00:31:35.015
Paradise Lost also
features a laborer,

00:31:35.015 --> 00:31:39.170
you'll remember:
the belated peasant who sees,

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:42.095
or dreams he sees,
fairy elves at

00:31:42.095 --> 00:31:46.300
twilight.Now,
Milton began Paradise Lost

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:51.877
with the claim that he would
assert eternal providence and

00:31:51.877 --> 00:31:56.925
justify the ways of God to men.
It may very well have seemed at

00:31:56.925 --> 00:32:00.203
the beginning of the poem that
the idea of God's providence --

00:32:00.203 --> 00:32:03.764
of God's foreknowledge,
foreseeing -- was going to be

00:32:03.764 --> 00:32:07.720
completely at odds with the idea
of man's free will.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.114
A god who knows what's going to
happen in advance -- and I know

00:32:11.114 --> 00:32:14.180
I've made this argument a number
of times -- simply isn't

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.301
justified on some level -- this
is certainly what a lot of

00:32:17.301 --> 00:32:20.586
Milton's contemporaries thought
and generations of readers of

00:32:20.586 --> 00:32:23.816
the Bible before Milton thought
-- simply isn't justified in

00:32:23.816 --> 00:32:27.430
setting up a paradise that he
knows isn't going to last,

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:30.940
that will have to be lost.
But if we were struck by the

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.980
difficulty of Milton's theodicy
when we began the poem,

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:38.895
that's because we had no idea
then just how far Milton was

00:32:38.895 --> 00:32:44.070
going to be able to push our
conception of God and our notion

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:48.640
essentially of divine
providence.The whole idea of

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.901
divine providence has undergone
an amazing transformation over

00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:57.609
the course of Paradise
Lost,

00:32:57.609 --> 00:33:03.204
 and it makes its final
appearance in the poem's final

00:33:03.204 --> 00:33:06.473
lines.
Michael has just escorted Adam

00:33:06.473 --> 00:33:10.932
and Eve to the eastern gate of
paradise, and then he's

00:33:10.932 --> 00:33:14.130
disappeared -- "Thank God," we
say!

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:19.790
Just before Adam and Eve leave
Eden forever,

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:24.419
they look back:
Som natural tears they

00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:28.430
dropp'd, but wip'd them soon;
The World was all before

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.633
them, where to choose
Thir place of rest,

00:33:31.633 --> 00:33:36.504
and Providence thir guide:
They hand in hand with

00:33:36.504 --> 00:33:42.958
wand'ring steps and slow,
Through Eden took thir solitary

00:33:42.958 --> 00:33:47.254
way.
This exquisitely beautiful and

00:33:47.254 --> 00:33:53.119
quiet ending has always teased
the readers of Milton's poem.

00:33:53.119 --> 00:33:55.872
Our puzzlement,
I think, derives from the

00:33:55.872 --> 00:33:59.794
opposition here of ideas that
really seem entirely at odds

00:33:59.794 --> 00:34:03.761
with one another.
Adam has just been presented by

00:34:03.761 --> 00:34:08.480
Michael with a powerful vision
precisely of the workings of

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.489
divine providence in the
universe.

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:15.478
We're not surprised to see Adam
and Eve departing the garden

00:34:15.478 --> 00:34:19.330
"with Providence thir guide"
given what we've just learned

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.328
from Michael;
but in the light of the

00:34:22.328 --> 00:34:26.667
presence of this guide,
the final two lines of the poem

00:34:26.667 --> 00:34:31.247
always seem so difficult to
understand: "They hand in hand

00:34:31.247 --> 00:34:36.405
with wand'ring steps and slow,
/ through Eden took thir

00:34:36.405 --> 00:34:41.290
solitary way."The
eighteenth-century critic and

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:46.176
classical editor Dr.
Richard Bentley was surely not

00:34:46.176 --> 00:34:51.159
the first reader to be puzzled
by these lines,

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:55.973
but he was the first reader to
spell out the difficulties of

00:34:55.973 --> 00:34:59.440
these last two lines.
Look here on your handout.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.890
Dr.
Bentley had found the

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:04.092
conclusion of the poem so
conflicted that he suggested

00:35:04.092 --> 00:35:08.019
that Milton couldn't possibly
have been responsible for them.

00:35:08.019 --> 00:35:12.258
Once again, the lines as they
appear in our text are clearly

00:35:12.258 --> 00:35:15.994
the garbled product of the
confused secretary to whom

00:35:15.994 --> 00:35:19.298
Milton was dictating.
So look at the handout -- this

00:35:19.298 --> 00:35:21.210
is near the bottom third of the
text.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:27.400
Bentley asks how the expression
of the last two lines can be

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.487
justified.
I'm going to quote Bentley

00:35:29.487 --> 00:35:31.387
here:
And how can the

00:35:31.387 --> 00:35:35.860
expression be justified,
with wandering steps and slow?

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:40.489
Why wandering?
Erratic steps?

00:35:40.489 --> 00:35:44.648
Very improper when in the line
before they were guided by

00:35:44.648 --> 00:35:47.284
providence.
It goes without saying that

00:35:47.284 --> 00:35:50.094
Bentley gets everything almost
consistently wrong when he talks

00:35:50.094 --> 00:35:53.268
about Milton,
but you have to give him this:

00:35:53.268 --> 00:35:58.082
he's an amazingly astute reader
of poetic tension and poetic

00:35:58.082 --> 00:36:00.946
contradiction.
It's an awfully good question:

00:36:00.946 --> 00:36:03.948
how can it be that Adam and Eve
are wandering at the same time

00:36:03.948 --> 00:36:05.769
that they're guided by
Providence?

00:36:05.769 --> 00:36:09.253
Milton is able to pack into the
final lines of Paradise Lost

00:36:09.253 --> 00:36:12.061
really the central question
of the entire poem:

00:36:12.061 --> 00:36:14.590
how can it be that human beings
are free,

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:19.410
free to wander,
if there's a providential force

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:24.860
out there that seems to
determine their movements?

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.933
In other words,
how can God's foreknowledge be

00:36:27.933 --> 00:36:31.894
squared or be reconciled with
man's free will?This is a

00:36:31.894 --> 00:36:35.650
problem that has been gathering
ground fast at our heels

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:39.269
throughout our reading of
Paradise Lost.

00:36:39.269 --> 00:36:43.938
It's here at the end that
Milton makes a final attempt at

00:36:43.938 --> 00:36:48.856
resolution, a final attempt --
this is his last chance -- at

00:36:48.856 --> 00:36:52.623
reconciliation.
Milton tells us that "he World

00:36:52.623 --> 00:36:56.335
was all before them,
where to choose / thir place of

00:36:56.335 --> 00:36:59.505
rest…"
It seems on a first reading

00:36:59.505 --> 00:37:03.590
that the guiding power of
Providence will assist them in

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:07.110
their choice of a place of rest,
but of course it's more

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:11.558
complicated than that.
The word "providence" in this

00:37:11.558 --> 00:37:16.789
sentence can,
I think, also be the object of

00:37:16.789 --> 00:37:21.602
the verb "to choose."
Adam and Eve are not only

00:37:21.602 --> 00:37:25.010
choosing a place out of their
own free will;

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:28.662
it's also possible that they're
also choosing Providence.I

00:37:28.662 --> 00:37:32.161
think this possibility,
this secondary syntactical

00:37:32.161 --> 00:37:36.704
possibility, is a really daring
and radical move on Milton's

00:37:36.704 --> 00:37:39.101
part.
Even the most absolute

00:37:39.101 --> 00:37:41.934
certainties of divine
foreknowledge,

00:37:41.934 --> 00:37:46.549
this enormous institution of
God's providence -- even that

00:37:46.549 --> 00:37:51.002
can be subsumed within the
all-encompassing power of the

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:55.420
human capacity to choose freely.
Adam and Eve not only have a

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.949
paradise within them happier
far;

00:37:56.949 --> 00:38:00.973
perhaps they also have a
Providence within them,

00:38:00.973 --> 00:38:06.281
and surely that is happier far
as well.You'll notice on the

00:38:06.281 --> 00:38:11.075
bottom of the handout that
Bentley proposed that the last

00:38:11.075 --> 00:38:15.269
lines of Paradise Lost be
rewritten.

00:38:15.269 --> 00:38:18.870
So he gives us what he assumes
[laughs]

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:24.365
must have been what Milton
actually dictated but had gotten

00:38:24.365 --> 00:38:29.000
mis-transcribed.
Bentley wants to do away with

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.820
all of the ambiguity,
and he suggests these lines as

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:38.073
an alternative:
"Then hand in hand with social

00:38:38.073 --> 00:38:43.366
steps their way / Through Eden
took with heavenly comfort

00:38:43.366 --> 00:38:48.469
cheered" [laughter]
You have to hand it to him.

00:38:48.469 --> 00:38:51.268
Of course, it goes without
saying that he's a terrible

00:38:51.268 --> 00:38:53.750
poet, but you can see what he's
trying to do.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:58.354
He's trying to reconcile the
entire poem with a much more

00:38:58.354 --> 00:39:03.535
familiar Sunday-school image of
divine providence.Bentley is

00:39:03.535 --> 00:39:07.400
just so much more orthodox than
our Milton.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.334
He wants to imagine a god who's
still capable of offering

00:39:11.334 --> 00:39:15.550
assistance and consolation but
also punishment from above,

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:19.709
a god who's still capable of
intervening in the realm of

00:39:19.709 --> 00:39:22.203
nature.
Milton, I think,

00:39:22.203 --> 00:39:28.583
wants very much to resist that.
The world of Paradise Lost

00:39:28.583 --> 00:39:33.519
by the end is an almost
entirely secular world.

00:39:33.519 --> 00:39:37.984
The new world order that this
great religious poem has

00:39:37.984 --> 00:39:43.290
prepared us for is on some level
the secular world of modernity,

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:46.830
our world.
Adam and Eve are solitary here

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:51.630
at the end of the poem because
there's no longer a personal --

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:56.272
an anthropomorphic deity who's
in a position to intervene in

00:39:56.272 --> 00:39:59.877
their lives.
Now they may drop some tears in

00:39:59.877 --> 00:40:03.021
leaving paradise,
but they leave behind that

00:40:03.021 --> 00:40:07.409
shadowy type of the personal
arbitrary deity from the Book of

00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:09.708
Genesis.
They are free now,

00:40:09.708 --> 00:40:13.005
as Milton is free,
to choose Providence -- by

00:40:13.005 --> 00:40:16.826
which I mean they can choose an
alternative image of

00:40:16.826 --> 00:40:20.798
providential guidance,
an alternative understanding of

00:40:20.798 --> 00:40:21.803
that.Now,
Dr.

00:40:21.803 --> 00:40:25.197
Bentley also takes issue with
the term "wandering" here

00:40:25.197 --> 00:40:28.905
because he assumes that the word
"wandering" has to have its

00:40:28.905 --> 00:40:31.329
evil,
fallen connotations,

00:40:31.329 --> 00:40:35.718
as it did for Adam in Book Ten.
"Wandering steps" for Dr.

00:40:35.718 --> 00:40:39.706
Bentley are necessarily erratic
steps since after the Fall,

00:40:39.706 --> 00:40:43.900
of course, the whole concept of
wandering and all the freedoms

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.199
that wandering implied have
become suspect.

00:40:47.199 --> 00:40:52.914
But now at the end of the poem,
Milton's attempting to reassert

00:40:52.914 --> 00:40:56.969
the innocent meaning of the word
"wander."

00:40:56.969 --> 00:41:00.580
All of the doctrinal structures
of the poem have been

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:04.329
internalized by Adam and Eve by
the end of the poem,

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:07.810
and on some level this was the
point of Michael's history

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:11.699
lesson.
It was his attempt to compel

00:41:11.699 --> 00:41:16.099
their internalization of
Providence.

00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:19.615
Wandering can be seen as
sanctioned now and as innocent

00:41:19.615 --> 00:41:23.196
now because wandering is
predicated on something like an

00:41:23.196 --> 00:41:28.033
internalized providential guide.
And we knew this had to be the

00:41:28.033 --> 00:41:32.570
case: Eve was right all along.
Wandering is in the end

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:36.150
perfectly allowable in Milton's
universe.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:40.872
We get to the end of this
biblical epic not with prophecy,

00:41:40.872 --> 00:41:45.429
but we end the poem in the mode
of romance wandering.

00:41:45.429 --> 00:41:48.739
This is an ending that's not an
ending at all.

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:53.320
Milton successfully resists the
drive to closure.Now,

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.610
we didn't know,
of course,

00:41:55.610 --> 00:42:00.319
when we started reading the
poem just what Milton could have

00:42:00.319 --> 00:42:04.310
meant by his desire to assert
divine providence,

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:08.995
to assert eternal providence.
"I may assert Eternal

00:42:08.995 --> 00:42:14.239
Providence, / and justify the
ways of God to men," he told us

00:42:14.239 --> 00:42:17.867
in the first invocation,
but the significance of this

00:42:17.867 --> 00:42:20.447
claim becomes clearer by the
time we get to the end of the

00:42:20.447 --> 00:42:23.070
poem.
We move from a shadowy type of

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:27.289
the claim closer to something
much more like its truth.

00:42:27.289 --> 00:42:30.783
There's a sense in which
Milton's claim to assert eternal

00:42:30.783 --> 00:42:34.714
providence may find its ultimate
meaning -- this is one critical

00:42:34.714 --> 00:42:38.670
conjecture,
and I'm quite taken with it --

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:42.998
in the original,
the root, sense of the word

00:42:42.998 --> 00:42:45.694
assert.
The verb to assert,

00:42:45.694 --> 00:42:47.699
and you can see this from the
bottom of the handout,

00:42:47.699 --> 00:42:52.174
comes from the Latin verb
asserere,

00:42:52.174 --> 00:42:57.849
"to remove from service,
to declare a slave free."

00:42:57.849 --> 00:43:02.983
Milton is declaring the slave,
Providence, free.I'll

00:43:02.983 --> 00:43:07.276
conclude here with a
consideration of what that

00:43:07.276 --> 00:43:12.783
alternative meaning of the verb
assert might actually

00:43:12.783 --> 00:43:16.040
portend.
There's the obvious arrogance

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:20.277
in this assertion that Milton on
some level is assuming the role

00:43:20.277 --> 00:43:23.152
of a slave-master,
a slave owner placing

00:43:23.152 --> 00:43:25.590
Providence in the role of a
slave.

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:29.465
That's identifiably Miltonic,
I guess, but there's another

00:43:29.465 --> 00:43:33.000
sense in which Milton can be
seen as asserting divine

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.429
providence,
asserting eternal providence.

00:43:35.429 --> 00:43:39.839
He's liberating a conception of
Providence that has been

00:43:39.839 --> 00:43:44.489
enslaved and silenced by
orthodox Christian theologians.

00:43:44.489 --> 00:43:48.047
It's as if the notion of
Providence had been enslaved by

00:43:48.047 --> 00:43:51.409
the literal-minded doctrinaire
readers of Genesis.

00:43:51.409 --> 00:43:55.031
Milton wants us to know that it
is our good fortune as readers

00:43:55.031 --> 00:43:58.949
of Paradise Lost that we
have John Milton -- John Milton,

00:43:58.949 --> 00:44:03.059
like some wandering knight in a
chivalric romance -- to come to

00:44:03.059 --> 00:44:06.772
the rescue.You'll remember
the note on the verse that

00:44:06.772 --> 00:44:10.285
Milton had appended to a later
printing of Paradise

00:44:10.285 --> 00:44:13.098
Lost,
 explaining why his poem

00:44:13.098 --> 00:44:15.940
didn't rhyme.
Milton told us there that he

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:19.980
was saving poetry from the
troublesome and modern bondage

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.848
of rhyming.
Milton was liberating poetry

00:44:23.848 --> 00:44:29.770
from a type of enslavement,
but Milton is trying to save us

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:33.020
as readers,
too, I think -- to save us from

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:35.780
our enslavement,
freeing us from the shackles of

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:39.480
what he takes to be are the
shackles of religious orthodoxy,

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.715
from normative social and
poetic conventions,

00:44:42.715 --> 00:44:46.318
and to save us from the
shackles of the tyranny of

00:44:46.318 --> 00:44:50.533
literary tradition.
He has attempted in Paradise

00:44:50.533 --> 00:44:55.254
Lost to free us finally from
the troublesome and modern

00:44:55.254 --> 00:44:58.510
bondage of literary
reading.Okay.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:01.849
I'm going to end the lecture on
Paradise Lost there,

00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:05.015
but I have a word to say about
the reading for after the

00:45:05.015 --> 00:45:09.007
Thanksgiving break.
Do give yourself some time with

00:45:09.007 --> 00:45:12.880
the first two books of
Paradise Regained.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.730
You won't be the first to
think -- if you think this --

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.183
that Milton is writing in
shackles when he writes his

00:45:20.183 --> 00:45:23.702
sequel to Paradise
Lost; but you have to

00:45:23.702 --> 00:45:27.685
give yourself a little bit of
time to appreciate the severity

00:45:27.685 --> 00:45:31.248
of this poem,
its uncompromising aesthetic

00:45:31.248 --> 00:45:35.818
discipline, because only by
doing that will you develop what

00:45:35.818 --> 00:45:40.078
I know will be your ultimate
affection for its delicious

00:45:40.078 --> 00:45:41.970
peculiarities.
Okay.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:43.303
Have a good break.

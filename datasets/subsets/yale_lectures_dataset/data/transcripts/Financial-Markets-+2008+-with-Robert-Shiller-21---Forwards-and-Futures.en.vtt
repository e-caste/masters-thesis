00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.440
Professor Robert
Shiller: I wanted first to

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.488
just think back a little bit
about the lecture we got from

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:12.816
Steve Schwarzman on Friday.
Before he came,

00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:17.249
I talked with him in my office
and I had the audacity to ask

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.982
him if he thought there was any
chance that his fortune was just

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:26.137
due to luck.
I said, why we have this

00:00:26.137 --> 00:00:32.852
efficient markets theory in
finance that says that nobody

00:00:32.852 --> 00:00:37.570
can beat the market.
So, what do you think he said?

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.616
Well, obviously he believes in
himself, but I'm inclined to

00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:50.043
believe in him also.
Efficient markets theory never

00:00:50.043 --> 00:00:53.977
sounded right;
one thing about efficient

00:00:53.977 --> 00:00:58.383
markets theory that has always
bothered me is this idea that

00:00:58.383 --> 00:01:02.640
the so-called "smart money" sets
prices in the market.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.469
The thing that bothers me about
it is, who is the "smart money,"

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.659
anyway?
It's as if it's all or nothing

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.551
thing;
there's the smart money and

00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:14.519
then it's the dumb money and the
smart money rules.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:18.100
Aren't there all different
gradations of intelligence and

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.158
insight?
It's not like--why should there

00:01:21.158 --> 00:01:23.810
be just one level of smart
money?

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.077
So, I think he probably
exemplifies a higher level of

00:01:29.077 --> 00:01:33.779
smart money than smart.
I think a lot of mistakes

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:38.553
people make in judging financial
markets is being easily

00:01:38.553 --> 00:01:43.240
impressed by someone's
stockbroker or someone's analyst

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.060
who seems very smart and is very
smart,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.420
but may not be enough to
outsmart the markets.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.385
That's the lesson of
efficiency, especially when

00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:59.542
you're young.
I think you may not realize how

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:04.106
many smart people there are in
the world, so when you're

00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:09.084
dealing in a--trying to win in
financial markets--you have to

00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:13.980
take account of who is really
out there and how much insight

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.539
and effort and research are they
putting into their trading.

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.830
Do you really think you can
beat that?

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.189
That's the lesson of efficient
markets.

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.830
I don't think the lesson is
that you can't--it's impossible

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.990
for anyone no matter how smart
to beat the market.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.807
Now of course,
Albert Einstein never made any

00:02:37.807 --> 00:02:40.968
money in the stock market.
In fact, TIAA-CREF,

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:44.138
the pension fund,
had an ad campaign in which

00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:48.172
they pointed that Albert
Einstein left all of his pension

00:02:48.172 --> 00:02:52.457
investing to TIAA-CREF.
He was a professor and they're

00:02:52.457 --> 00:02:57.418
a pension fund for professors.
Einstein didn't think he could

00:02:57.418 --> 00:03:01.522
beat the market and Mr.
Schwarzman very candidly

00:03:01.522 --> 00:03:06.760
pointed out that he didn't have
the greatest math scores.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.089
Isn't that how he put it?
He said he was no math genius

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:17.313
and you think finance requires a
lot of math, but I think that

00:03:17.313 --> 00:03:22.110
it's something about practical
intelligence.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.875
Psychologists have talked about
different kinds of

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:30.025
intelligence--this is all
supposed to be coming up here

00:03:30.025 --> 00:03:33.421
now.
At least we're seeing something

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:35.216
now.
This is why I don't like

00:03:35.216 --> 00:03:46.310
Powerpoint, actually;
this kind of thing happens it

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:55.530
always seems to happen.
So, that's it.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:04.328
I'm not going to use this for a
few minutes.--But,

00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:12.229
remember Carl Icahn,
when he talked to us,

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:16.283
said something about he always
just had some--he was always

00:04:16.283 --> 00:04:21.928
just good at making money.
I think that there are separate

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.024
talents.
I mean, some people love

00:04:24.024 --> 00:04:26.544
markets and they like to think
about them and figure out how

00:04:26.544 --> 00:04:29.363
they work.
If they have the right kind of

00:04:29.363 --> 00:04:33.589
intelligence and the right kind
of spirit to do the work,

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:36.910
they ought to be able to beat
the market.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.053
I've talked to Icahn a number
of times and I have the idea

00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:45.269
that he's a very down-to-earth,
solid, inquisitive sort;

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:47.170
he wants to know what's going
on.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.689
When I've talked to him,
sometimes he'll ask the same

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:53.293
question of me;
he's trying to get information

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.538
from me.
He asks the same question from

00:04:55.538 --> 00:04:58.975
me three different ways because
apparently my answer isn't

00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:02.774
satisfactory and he must think I
might know something because he

00:05:02.774 --> 00:05:06.184
keeps asking.
But, I think that's the kind of

00:05:06.184 --> 00:05:10.982
persistence--certain personality
traits--persistence at trying to

00:05:10.982 --> 00:05:15.105
figure out what really makes
things work is important in

00:05:15.105 --> 00:05:18.497
these markets.
I think it's just relish or

00:05:18.497 --> 00:05:22.795
inclination to keep thinking
about them, so maybe that's why

00:05:22.795 --> 00:05:25.709
I went into economics as a
professor.

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:28.902
I don't know that I really was
someone who wants to watch the

00:05:28.902 --> 00:05:32.318
markets all day;
so, you have to judge your own

00:05:32.318 --> 00:05:37.063
interests.
Anyway, it was very nice that

00:05:37.063 --> 00:05:44.352
we got--that Steve Schwarzman
came and told us about his

00:05:44.352 --> 00:05:51.399
life's work.
Anyway, I want to talk today

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:56.497
about futures.
One more thing I wanted to say

00:05:56.497 --> 00:05:58.643
about Schwarzman.
At one point,

00:05:58.643 --> 00:06:01.663
he said very confidently,
I thought--and I don't know if

00:06:01.663 --> 00:06:05.012
you heard this right--that this
current financial crisis ought

00:06:05.012 --> 00:06:08.637
to be over in a year.
He said something--and maybe it

00:06:08.637 --> 00:06:12.040
was a little vague--about
investing in distressed

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.435
securities now as an opportunity
because I think he pointed out

00:06:16.435 --> 00:06:20.971
that AAA mortgage securities are
selling for eighty some cents on

00:06:20.971 --> 00:06:24.019
the dollar and it can't be that
bad.

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:27.627
This is the same theme that we
got from David Swensen and I've

00:06:27.627 --> 00:06:30.939
heard it from others--that
that's the opportunity now.

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:34.217
When I hear Steve Schwarzman
proclaiming that he thinks

00:06:34.217 --> 00:06:37.009
this--I thought he said
something like that,

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:40.660
that this business crisis will
be over before long.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.438
It made me wonder,
do I know more than he does

00:06:43.438 --> 00:06:47.265
about that sort of thing because
I don't think it's going to be

00:06:47.265 --> 00:06:49.408
over soon?
Then it gets back to,

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:52.940
I think, you have to put all
these people in perspective;

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.290
there are so many different
kinds of expertise.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.804
When you listen to someone you
always have to ask,

00:06:59.804 --> 00:07:04.780
well what does he or she know
that is specific to their

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.280
expertise?
I don't think Schwarzman is a

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.481
macroeconomist,
so I don't want to say he's

00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:17.264
wrong, but he might be wrong.
The good thing is to listen to

00:07:17.264 --> 00:07:23.620
everyone and not accept that
anyone has the whole truth.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.560
Anyway, I want to get on to
futures markets.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.905
That is a very important topic
in finance and the important

00:07:33.905 --> 00:07:39.533
thing to understand is,
when I put an "s" on the end

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:45.319
"futures," that refers to a
marketplace with a particular

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:50.670
characteristic,
as traded on a number of

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.779
exchanges.
Notably, in the U.S.

00:07:54.779 --> 00:08:01.934
the biggest exchange for
futures is the Chicago

00:08:01.934 --> 00:08:09.089
Mercantile Exchange,
which just merged with The

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:19.199
Chicago Board of Trade and they
are now called the CME Group.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:22.490
Futures, since it has its
origin in agriculture,

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.990
is a Chicago thing rather than
a New York thing.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:31.034
Chicago is the "second city,"
or it was the second biggest

00:08:31.034 --> 00:08:36.167
city, hog-butcher to the world,
farmers' marketplace in the

00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:38.847
Midwest;
so, futures in the United

00:08:38.847 --> 00:08:40.270
States started there.

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:49.769
Actually, futures didn't start
in Chicago;

00:08:49.769 --> 00:09:06.903
it started in Japan on an
island in Osaka called Dojima in

00:09:06.903 --> 00:09:14.116
the 1600s.
I'm sorry, did I--yeah it was

00:09:14.116 --> 00:09:21.330
the 1600s--1673 is the date for
the first futures market.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:28.341
I was just in Osaka again a few
months ago and I again asked,

00:09:28.341 --> 00:09:35.470
can I please see Dojima because
it's such a historic place.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.791
Again they said,
there's nothing to see there,

00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:40.009
it's all--anything from long
ago is gone.

00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:43.169
That was where these markets
started.

00:09:43.169 --> 00:09:48.432
Let's go back--and I'm not sure
how well-developed it was in

00:09:48.432 --> 00:09:54.139
1673, but let's say early 1700s
in Dojima--what was happening?

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:56.429
Well, it was the rice center
for Japan.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:10:02.375
The people--rice merchants
would bring their rice to Dojima

00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:07.938
and sell them there.
Naturally, as you would expect,

00:10:07.938 --> 00:10:14.129
there were big warehouses for
rice, which would store it;

00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:21.049
it would be a natural thing to
see at the center of trade.

00:10:21.049 --> 00:10:26.309
It was a big and thriving trade
center.

00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:29.439
People, when they buy--so
incidentally,

00:10:29.439 --> 00:10:32.980
let's talk about the
fundamental problem.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:38.808
Agricultural commodities like
rice are harvested typically

00:10:38.808 --> 00:10:43.090
once a year.
Actually, I think rice has more

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.320
than one harvest,
but let's just simplify it;

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.299
let's say it's harvested once
per year.

00:10:49.299 --> 00:10:52.648
People depend on it for their
lives, actually,

00:10:52.648 --> 00:10:56.220
because they need the food for
the whole year.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.550
That means there's a storage
business;

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.529
rice has to be stored;
you have to keep it away from

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:06.370
moisture and rot and away from
rats and vermin.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:12.321
That's a business and it's a
very important business for any

00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:15.103
country.
If it weren't rice,

00:11:15.103 --> 00:11:19.490
it would be some other grain,
which is stored.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.938
When people buy and sell grain
they know it's--they're thinking

00:11:23.938 --> 00:11:28.172
out at least a year because
that's how long the cycle is for

00:11:28.172 --> 00:11:32.227
one harvest--one cycle.
So, lots of contracts are

00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:36.972
signed to buy and sell rice,
but typically at some future

00:11:36.972 --> 00:11:41.418
date.
We talk about "spot contracts,"

00:11:41.418 --> 00:11:47.740
which means buying and selling
something right now.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.841
If you show up at the warehouse
and say, I've got my wagons,

00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:55.864
I want to load rice in.
How much do I have to pay to

00:11:55.864 --> 00:11:58.771
get rice?
That price would be called the

00:11:58.771 --> 00:12:01.419
"spot price"--on the spot,
right now.

00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:07.195
But often, you would show up at
the warehouse and you would say,

00:12:07.195 --> 00:12:11.948
I have some trucks,
wagons coming next week or next

00:12:11.948 --> 00:12:16.419
month and I want to arrange now
to buy the rice.

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:23.055
If you say--if you agree on a
price today for delivery in one

00:12:23.055 --> 00:12:29.360
month, that's called a "forward
contract," not futures.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.210
There's an important
distinction between forward and

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.590
futures.
A forward contract--let me

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.159
explain what a forward
contract--it's very simple.

00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:43.783
It's a contract between two
parties to exchange something at

00:12:43.783 --> 00:12:49.406
a future date for a price in the
future that's predetermined

00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:51.408
today.
For example,

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:56.387
a forward contract will be
between a rice merchant and the

00:12:56.387 --> 00:13:01.628
warehouse that in two months I
will come and take delivery of

00:13:01.628 --> 00:13:06.694
so many bushels of rice and then
I will pay such and such a

00:13:06.694 --> 00:13:09.570
price;
that's a forward contract.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.945
Before 1673,
there were lots of forward

00:13:12.945 --> 00:13:17.210
contracts and lots of people
trading in these,

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:22.415
so someone in Dojima thought,
why don't we set up a big

00:13:22.415 --> 00:13:28.199
market for these because people
have trouble knowing what the

00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:33.255
price is for a forward contract.
People would travel around from

00:13:33.255 --> 00:13:36.120
one warehouse to another and
they'd get a different price

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.138
from one or the other;
they'd kind of wonder what the

00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:41.746
price is today,
so someone said well why don't

00:13:41.746 --> 00:13:44.759
we kind of create a market for
forward contracts.

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:47.600
But, we don't call them forward
contracts;

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.951
I don't know what they called
them in Japan,

00:13:49.951 --> 00:13:52.029
but I just want you to get the
idea.

00:13:52.029 --> 00:13:54.223
The idea is,
let's create a marketplace,

00:13:54.223 --> 00:13:57.542
a central marketplace so that
all these different--you don't

00:13:57.542 --> 00:14:00.917
have to go around to a hundred
different warehouses to try to

00:14:00.917 --> 00:14:03.694
find the best price;
you find out what the real

00:14:03.694 --> 00:14:07.363
price is.
What they did was they created

00:14:07.363 --> 00:14:13.374
an exchange in Dojima and the
exchange had a lot of modern

00:14:13.374 --> 00:14:17.580
features;
it had a trading floor.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.957
There was a designated area
where people who wanted to trade

00:14:22.957 --> 00:14:28.699
in rice futures would congregate
and all trades were supposed to

00:14:28.699 --> 00:14:31.685
be done there,
so it became a central

00:14:31.685 --> 00:14:34.628
marketplace.
So many people came to the

00:14:34.628 --> 00:14:39.584
exchange floor that it got very
noisy and traders can be very

00:14:39.584 --> 00:14:43.220
noisy people--shouting and
getting upset;

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.598
trading rapidly back and forth.
So, they developed,

00:14:47.598 --> 00:14:51.301
in Dojima, a set of hand
signals so that it was so noisy

00:14:51.301 --> 00:14:55.070
and loud that you couldn't talk
sometimes and it was hard

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.840
to--especially to communicate
something to someone on the

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.839
other side of the room.
So, they invented hand signals

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:06.929
so the traders would be--I don't
know exactly what they were,

00:15:06.929 --> 00:15:08.867
but typically when the--if you
had something like this--you

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:10.070
hold your hand with your palm
out,

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.079
that means I want to sell and
if it's four fingers up,

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:16.654
that means four contracts.
If you put it this way,

00:15:16.654 --> 00:15:20.179
it would be buying;
I want to buy four contracts.

00:15:20.179 --> 00:15:25.597
Those hand signals developed in
Osaka and they became a mainstay

00:15:25.597 --> 00:15:32.310
of futures markets after that.
Another thing they did in Japan

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:39.720
to create the central market was
to standardize the rice.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.863
Now, this is very important;
if you go shopping around to

00:15:50.863 --> 00:15:54.189
different warehouses to try to
buy rice, you'll get some

00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:57.314
warehouse who says,
well I'm charging a higher

00:15:57.314 --> 00:16:01.179
price but my rice is better then
that other guy's rice.

00:16:01.179 --> 00:16:04.350
His has some worms in it
sometimes;

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:09.090
don't trust that other guy,
or whatever it is.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:13.128
Rice isn't all the same;
there are different varieties

00:16:13.128 --> 00:16:15.870
and some of them taste better
than others.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.040
So, how would you ever know
what the price of rice is;

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.203
it's just a mess.
What they did in Osaka is they

00:16:23.203 --> 00:16:29.289
made a standard form of rice for
delivery in their contract.

00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:34.036
That's important because
it--there are many kinds of

00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:39.807
rice, but they picked one that's
maybe the most common and then

00:16:39.807 --> 00:16:42.174
they said,
that's what all of our

00:16:42.174 --> 00:16:44.667
contracts are about;
so, you would be taking

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:48.241
delivery of a standard rice.
Moreover, at the exchange,

00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:52.059
they had experts on rice who
could tell whether it was that

00:16:52.059 --> 00:16:55.570
contract.
It's not the best rice;

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.174
it's the most common rice.
I visited the coffee,

00:16:59.174 --> 00:17:03.401
sugar and cocoa exchange in New
York once and jokingly I said,

00:17:03.401 --> 00:17:07.274
can I have a cup of coffee?
This is the coffee,

00:17:07.274 --> 00:17:11.289
sugar and cocoa exchange;
surely I can get a cup of

00:17:11.289 --> 00:17:13.118
coffee here.
Then the guy said,

00:17:13.118 --> 00:17:16.344
who was showing me around,
he said, well we could give you

00:17:16.344 --> 00:17:19.230
a cup of coffee but it's not
what we trade here.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.640
He says, you wouldn't like the
coffee we trade here;

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.829
it's not Starbucks;
it's the most standard.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:29.567
So, they set up a standard for
coffee at the coffee--maybe he

00:17:29.567 --> 00:17:32.187
was being too candid.
I don't know if they would say

00:17:32.187 --> 00:17:34.437
that officially.
They set up a standard for

00:17:34.437 --> 00:17:37.530
coffee at the coffee,
sugar, cocoa exchange and then

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.502
no one would ever deliver better
coffee than that,

00:17:40.502 --> 00:17:43.400
right?
Well, I have to explain that.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.249
Everyone--well,
they wouldn't even be allowed

00:17:45.249 --> 00:17:47.960
to;
the whole idea is the contract

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.115
has standards.
What actually happens--if you

00:17:51.115 --> 00:17:55.188
have a contract to deliver rice
or coffee or anything like that

00:17:55.188 --> 00:17:58.933
and there's some expert there
who's going to judge whether

00:17:58.933 --> 00:18:02.810
what you delivered was up to
quality standards and you are a

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:07.113
smart businessperson,
you will deliver exactly the

00:18:07.113 --> 00:18:10.720
minimum quality to fulfill the
contract.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.591
It'll never be below the
minimum quality because no one

00:18:14.591 --> 00:18:18.430
can deliver it;
the testers will not allow that.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.993
And it can't be above the
minimum standard because you'd

00:18:21.993 --> 00:18:24.309
never do that;
you'd be stupid to do that.

00:18:24.309 --> 00:18:27.690
So, you always--it always
becomes the standard variety.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:33.958
What they did at the futures
market is they then not only had

00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:39.392
standardized the rice,
but they standardized delivery

00:18:39.392 --> 00:18:42.840
dates and delivery locations.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.859
What would you trade in these
futures markets?

00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:55.149
You would be trading--you'd
either be buying or selling rice

00:18:55.149 --> 00:18:59.148
for future delivery on a
standardized delivery date at a

00:18:59.148 --> 00:19:03.656
standardized location--probably
one of the warehouses that they

00:19:03.656 --> 00:19:08.114
designate.
That might not be the rice you

00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:14.374
want or the date you want and
yet, somehow the market gets

00:19:14.374 --> 00:19:19.010
going and gets very big.
This is the reason:

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:23.318
what a futures market does
that's different from a

00:19:23.318 --> 00:19:28.505
warehouse market is it sets up a
standard price and a liquid

00:19:28.505 --> 00:19:32.408
market.
So, people end up using the

00:19:32.408 --> 00:19:38.843
futures market to lock in the
price or to hedge price risk and

00:19:38.843 --> 00:19:45.489
they know that the price in the
futures market is the meaningful

00:19:45.489 --> 00:19:50.059
price.
You hear all kinds of prices of

00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:52.609
rice;
there will be rumors here and

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:56.258
there that someone will say,
I saw rice sell for such and

00:19:56.258 --> 00:19:58.799
such--so many Yen or whatever it
is.

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.859
Don't believe any of that
nonsense.

00:20:00.859 --> 00:20:03.972
Who knows what was sold or what
terms there were or what

00:20:03.972 --> 00:20:07.456
exigencies there were.
Only look at the futures market

00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:11.230
because the futures market is
absolutely standardized.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.903
You know the terms of delivery,
the location,

00:20:13.903 --> 00:20:17.720
and everything else.
What ended up happening is that

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.599
everyone wanted to trade in the
futures market and it became a

00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:27.160
huge market and then everyone
started watching the futures

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:34.240
price.
That's what we now have;

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.860
that's what is in a futures-- I
wanted to tell you one other

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.296
curious thing about the--well,
two other things about the

00:20:41.296 --> 00:20:44.864
Osaka market.
They had trading hours,

00:20:44.864 --> 00:20:47.768
just as do today.
In other words,

00:20:47.768 --> 00:20:51.419
only certain hours of the day
the floor was open and then it

00:20:51.419 --> 00:20:54.649
was shut off.
People would get very excited

00:20:54.649 --> 00:20:58.475
and trade very actively;
you have to somehow let people

00:20:58.475 --> 00:21:02.330
know that the trading time is
over and all trades have to stop

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:05.337
at the end of the day.
So, they had a burning fuse,

00:21:05.337 --> 00:21:08.446
which they would light in the
middle of the trading floor just

00:21:08.446 --> 00:21:11.555
a few minutes before the end of
the day and you could see this

00:21:11.555 --> 00:21:14.562
flame and that meant you better
finish your trades right now

00:21:14.562 --> 00:21:17.750
because when the flame goes out,
it's over.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:22.825
We don't have fuses anymore;
we have clocks and a bell that

00:21:22.825 --> 00:21:25.809
announces the beginning and end
at an exchange.

00:21:25.809 --> 00:21:29.211
There's one other thing they
had, which I think is kind of

00:21:29.211 --> 00:21:32.856
curious that hasn't been copied.
They had people called

00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:37.265
watermen, who after the fuse
went out they carried buckets of

00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:41.473
water onto the exchange.
If anybody was still trading,

00:21:41.473 --> 00:21:45.781
they splashed them with water.
That was to douse the--the fuse

00:21:45.781 --> 00:21:47.910
is out;
everything is doused for today.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:51.769
We don't do that in modern
futures exchanges.

00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:53.809
Of course, it's all electronic
now;

00:21:53.809 --> 00:21:56.177
there's no--well,
it's getting increasingly

00:21:56.177 --> 00:21:59.607
electronic.
The CME and the CBOT still have

00:21:59.607 --> 00:22:05.002
trading floors like Dojima's and
they're still using these hand

00:22:05.002 --> 00:22:10.010
signals,
but it's getting lonely there

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:18.529
because everything is moving
away to the electronic markets.

00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:22.569
You'll still see on CNBC,
Bob Pisani will be standing at

00:22:22.569 --> 00:22:27.196
the T-bond trading pit and he'll
give his little--they focus the

00:22:27.196 --> 00:22:31.603
camera right on where all the
people are at and they're still

00:22:31.603 --> 00:22:36.230
out there jostling each other
and shouting at each other.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.757
So, it's still going on,
but it's increasingly becoming

00:22:39.757 --> 00:22:44.351
an electronic market.
I guess the most important

00:22:44.351 --> 00:22:50.654
thing to realize about futures
markets is that they're

00:22:50.654 --> 00:22:57.313
different from forward markets
in that it--with a futures

00:22:57.313 --> 00:23:00.468
market,
when you buy and sell a

00:23:00.468 --> 00:23:04.904
contract you are buying and
selling with the exchange or the

00:23:04.904 --> 00:23:10.160
clearing house of the exchange.
You do not know the counter

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.351
party;
you do not know who's on the

00:23:12.351 --> 00:23:15.963
other side.
With a forward market,

00:23:15.963 --> 00:23:21.910
you know very well who's on the
other side;

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.182
you're going to a warehouse and
there's this warehouse who's

00:23:25.182 --> 00:23:28.072
going to take your grain.
In the warehouse,

00:23:28.072 --> 00:23:33.069
you better trust the other side
because suppose the other side

00:23:33.069 --> 00:23:36.001
doesn't work.
Suppose you have your--you've

00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:39.412
loaded up all your rice and you
come to the warehouse and then

00:23:39.412 --> 00:23:41.537
the guy says,
I don't want to honor the

00:23:41.537 --> 00:23:42.861
contract.
I signed it,

00:23:42.861 --> 00:23:44.440
but I'm just not going to take
it;

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.809
I'm going to lower the price on
you.

00:23:46.809 --> 00:23:50.140
Then you have to sue this guy
and it's a big mess.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.966
The problem with forward
contracts is that they're not

00:23:53.966 --> 00:23:56.200
standardized;
you're not dealing with a

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.242
reputable exchange.
With an exchange,

00:23:58.242 --> 00:24:00.619
there is of course a counter
party.

00:24:00.619 --> 00:24:03.885
If you're selling rice and
someone else is buying it,

00:24:03.885 --> 00:24:07.779
there's an intermediary between
you and that's the exchange.

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:10.186
Since the exchange will honor
any contract,

00:24:10.186 --> 00:24:12.880
you don't have to worry about
the other side.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:19.593
That's another reason why
futures prices are so much more

00:24:19.593 --> 00:24:26.307
meaningful than spot or forward
prices because there's no

00:24:26.307 --> 00:24:34.220
counter-party risk unless you
worry about the exchange itself.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.630
Since the futures exchanges in
the U.S.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:39.226
have been here since the
nineteenth century and they've

00:24:39.226 --> 00:24:42.028
never lost a contract,
people assume as a first

00:24:42.028 --> 00:24:44.980
approximation,
that there's no counter-party

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.045
risk.
I still haven't maybe fully

00:24:49.045 --> 00:24:53.377
explained futures.
Let me--before we go on,

00:24:53.377 --> 00:24:57.712
I want to talk a little bit
about forwards because now we

00:24:57.712 --> 00:25:01.620
have a slide up here.
We do have forward contracts

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.769
and they still play an important
function.

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:09.870
The reason is that futures
markets, by their very nature,

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:15.608
are standardized markets.
Or you might say they're retail

00:25:15.608 --> 00:25:17.458
markets.
They have a huge number of

00:25:17.458 --> 00:25:19.359
people trading in them,
but it's all a standard thing.

00:25:19.359 --> 00:25:24.721
Forward markets are between
persons and so they can be--the

00:25:24.721 --> 00:25:28.049
contract can be anything you
want.

00:25:28.049 --> 00:25:33.929
So, forward contracts are very
important but they tend to be

00:25:33.929 --> 00:25:39.510
less--I tend to observe them
less because they don't have

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.880
this newsworthy character.
Everyone's talking about

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.814
futures prices because everyone
knows that is a very

00:25:46.814 --> 00:25:48.424
well-defined,
central market,

00:25:48.424 --> 00:25:53.057
liquid price.
The forward contracts are not

00:25:53.057 --> 00:25:55.460
liquid;
you can't get out of it.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:00.117
So if you, as a rice merchant,
sold your rice--as a rice

00:26:00.117 --> 00:26:04.944
farmer--you sold your rice
forward to a warehouse and then

00:26:04.944 --> 00:26:09.940
you change your mind--you want
to get out--you can't because

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.291
unless the other guy says,
I'll let you out,

00:26:13.291 --> 00:26:14.650
because you've just got a
contract.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:18.755
The futures has this active
trading in and out,

00:26:18.755 --> 00:26:21.789
so the prices seem to mean
more.

00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:24.170
Let's talk about forward
markets.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.130
There are forward markets for a
lot of things.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.804
One very important forward
market is the foreign exchange

00:26:29.804 --> 00:26:32.768
forward market.
This happens a lot because

00:26:32.768 --> 00:26:36.892
there are tons of businesses
that have--they sell things in

00:26:36.892 --> 00:26:41.299
countries around the world and
they get foreign currencies.

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:45.273
If you sell some--you're a
manufacturer and you sell

00:26:45.273 --> 00:26:49.091
something in Japan,
then they're paying you in yen

00:26:49.091 --> 00:26:52.910
and they might be paying you in
three months.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:56.528
So, you worry about the
exchange rate between dollars

00:26:56.528 --> 00:26:59.589
and yen, so you want to get it
in dollars.

00:26:59.589 --> 00:27:03.780
You might want to find a
counter party who will exchange

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:08.579
your yen for dollars in three
months or whatever the term is;

00:27:08.579 --> 00:27:11.916
that's called a forward
contract for exchange of

00:27:11.916 --> 00:27:14.619
currencies.
Very simple.

00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:19.418
I'm getting--I'm selling cars
in Japan--that sounds--that does

00:27:19.418 --> 00:27:22.150
happen--U.S.
cars sold in Japan.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.596
So, I'm going to get--I know
I'm going to get this yen in

00:27:25.596 --> 00:27:28.490
three months.
I just signed a contract with

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:32.430
somebody to exchange dollars--we
fixed the exchange rate;

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.269
that's called the forward
exchange rate.

00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:37.849
It's not necessarily the same
as today's exchange rate;

00:27:37.849 --> 00:27:40.410
in fact, it would generally be
systematically different.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.517
So, we have this,
what's called forward interest

00:27:44.517 --> 00:27:47.656
parity relation.
The forward--this is an

00:27:47.656 --> 00:27:51.538
arbitrage relationship that
holds very well in the forward

00:27:51.538 --> 00:27:55.831
market for foreign exchange.
The forward exchange

00:27:55.831 --> 00:28:00.193
rate--that's yen per dollar,
in the case,

00:28:00.193 --> 00:28:05.973
if we're talking about Japan
and U.S.--equals the spot

00:28:05.973 --> 00:28:12.516
exchange rate that's in yen per
dollar times one plus the yen

00:28:12.516 --> 00:28:18.950
interest rate--that's for three
months if it's a three-month

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:24.839
horizon--times one plus dollar
interest rate.

00:28:24.839 --> 00:28:28.599
And that relation holds very
well.

00:28:28.599 --> 00:28:33.678
If it didn't hold,
I could make money quickly

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:38.410
without risk and that shouldn't
happen.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:42.404
Think of it this way,
the interest rate in Japan is

00:28:42.404 --> 00:28:46.079
different from the interest rate
in the U.S.

00:28:46.079 --> 00:28:50.660
Government bonds issued in
Japan are perfectly safe.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.155
Well, I mean you could say of
course the Japanese government

00:28:54.155 --> 00:28:56.880
could default,
but it's not going to happen.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.846
To a first approximation,
it's not going to--we'll call

00:29:00.846 --> 00:29:04.539
it a zero probability.
Same thing with the U.S.

00:29:04.539 --> 00:29:08.029
How can two different countries
have different interest rates?

00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:10.224
You would think,
well wouldn't an investor

00:29:10.224 --> 00:29:13.490
always invest in the country
with the higher interest rate?

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.605
Why not if it's riskless?
Well, there is risk and that's

00:29:16.605 --> 00:29:19.710
exchange rate risk.
You can get rid of the risk by

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.319
taking a forward contract.
You could say,

00:29:22.319 --> 00:29:25.556
if you're living in Japan,
I note that interest rates are

00:29:25.556 --> 00:29:28.884
higher in the U.S.
than Japan, so I'm not going to

00:29:28.884 --> 00:29:31.750
go--I'm not going to invest in
yen bonds;

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.410
I'm going to invest in U.S.
bonds.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:37.956
Then, I'm going to cover myself
by making a forward contract to

00:29:37.956 --> 00:29:42.266
get the money back in yen.
Well, that's a very clear thing

00:29:42.266 --> 00:29:46.489
to do, but the problem is you
can't make any money doing it

00:29:46.489 --> 00:29:49.619
because this holds because of
arbitrage.

00:29:49.619 --> 00:29:52.908
There are so many people who've
noticed that--that interest

00:29:52.908 --> 00:29:55.980
rates are higher in the U.S.
than Japan;

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.410
they're both riskless interest
rates.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:01.600
It can't be right that there's
this profit opportunity that's

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.232
riskless, so the forward
exchange rate satisfies this

00:30:05.232 --> 00:30:08.456
relationship.
The forward rate equals the

00:30:08.456 --> 00:30:11.849
spot rate times the relative
interest rates.

00:30:11.849 --> 00:30:15.738
This is over the horizon
between now--this is not the

00:30:15.738 --> 00:30:19.477
annual interest rate,
unless it's an annual forward

00:30:19.477 --> 00:30:22.380
contract.
If it's a three-month forward

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:26.174
contract this would be the
interest earned in three months

00:30:26.174 --> 00:30:30.101
in yen and this would be the
interest earned in dollars over

00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:33.151
three months.
That's one kind of forward rate

00:30:33.151 --> 00:30:35.720
agreement and this market works
very well.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.878
It satisfies this
relation--we've explained--we

00:30:37.878 --> 00:30:40.556
know this market;
it just satisfies the forward

00:30:40.556 --> 00:30:49.773
interest parity condition.
Another forward market is the

00:30:49.773 --> 00:30:59.410
market for different interest
rates.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:07.465
We can have a forward loan.
We can say, I want to make a

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:10.319
loan at a future date of a
certain maturity;

00:31:10.319 --> 00:31:15.729
let's tie in the interest rate
now, so R is the contract

00:31:15.729 --> 00:31:18.424
rate.
Suppose you want to either

00:31:18.424 --> 00:31:21.309
borrow or lend money in the
future;

00:31:21.309 --> 00:31:24.314
we talked about forward rates
implicit in the term structure

00:31:24.314 --> 00:31:27.268
earlier and you could try to
achieve those forward rates as

00:31:27.268 --> 00:31:30.068
we talked about earlier by
buying and selling government

00:31:30.068 --> 00:31:31.903
bonds,
but this is another way to do

00:31:31.903 --> 00:31:35.930
it, which may be simpler.
It doesn't involve shorting

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.089
bonds;
you can just make a contract.

00:31:38.089 --> 00:31:42.746
There's a contract rate in the
forward contract and the

00:31:42.746 --> 00:31:47.402
contract says--the contract
specifies the contract rate

00:31:47.402 --> 00:31:52.490
R and the number of days
in the contract period;

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:56.507
that's how many days hence this
contract will be delivered--will

00:31:56.507 --> 00:31:59.235
be executed.
You can make any forward rate

00:31:59.235 --> 00:32:02.210
contract you want,
but this is the most standard

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:04.492
contract;
yet, it's between counter

00:32:04.492 --> 00:32:07.049
parties, so you can do whatever
you want.

00:32:07.049 --> 00:32:10.121
But, if you talk with a broker
and you got a standard contract

00:32:10.121 --> 00:32:12.722
you'd probably get this.
Now, the purpose of this

00:32:12.722 --> 00:32:14.930
contract is to lock in an
interest rate.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:18.053
It's a risk management
contract, so you don't actually

00:32:18.053 --> 00:32:21.177
want to borrow and lend from
this other person--you'll

00:32:21.177 --> 00:32:24.949
arrange that separately--but you
want to protect yourself so that

00:32:24.949 --> 00:32:28.839
you know today what interest
rate you can get in the future.

00:32:28.839 --> 00:32:37.020
What they do is they define
some measure of actual interest

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:45.764
rate and it could be something
like LIBOR, the London Interbank

00:32:45.764 --> 00:32:49.680
Offer Rate;
it's just an interest rate

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.380
that's defined by an agency in
London.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.160
They have a website and you can
read it.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.119
It's a well-known,
well-defined interest rate.

00:32:57.119 --> 00:33:00.831
So, you could say,
three-month LIBOR is the

00:33:00.831 --> 00:33:04.807
interest rate,
90 days in the future--D

00:33:04.807 --> 00:33:08.824
would be 90 and so,
what the contract specifies--it

00:33:08.824 --> 00:33:11.640
also specifies a contract
amount, A,

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:16.816
and B is actually
usually 360, but sometimes

00:33:16.816 --> 00:33:20.410
they'll say 365.
You can write whatever you want

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:23.200
in these contracts,
but this is standard--typically

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.185
360 days.
So, all it specified--what the

00:33:26.185 --> 00:33:29.660
contract says--there are two
counterparties;

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.539
there's the long and the short;
somebody is receiving interest

00:33:33.539 --> 00:33:37.714
and someone is paying interest.
The settlement is this amount,

00:33:37.714 --> 00:33:42.145
from one side to the other.
This formula actually--it

00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:46.536
doesn't appear in Fabozzi in
exactly this notation,

00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:50.839
but this is in the chapter on
futures markets.

00:33:50.839 --> 00:33:53.753
This equation,
although it's written a little

00:33:53.753 --> 00:33:57.593
differently, it's the same
equation that appears in Fabozzi

00:33:57.593 --> 00:34:00.109
in the chapter on futures
markets.

00:34:00.109 --> 00:34:03.954
What you do,
the standard forward contract

00:34:03.954 --> 00:34:09.675
says, one counter party pays the
other this amount and that is

00:34:09.675 --> 00:34:15.489
equal to the actual interest
rate minus the contract rate,

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:21.184
times the number of days,
times the contract amount,

00:34:21.184 --> 00:34:27.247
divided by B, times 100.
This 100 is here because

00:34:27.247 --> 00:34:32.201
L and R are
assumed to be measured in

00:34:32.201 --> 00:34:37.353
hundreds, like percent--3% is
really .03 x L x

00:34:37.353 --> 00:34:41.397
D.
This equation might be easier

00:34:41.397 --> 00:34:47.169
if you divide both numerator and
denominator by 100 then you can

00:34:47.169 --> 00:34:52.849
see that all that 100 is doing
is correcting the interest rates

00:34:52.849 --> 00:34:58.542
from percent to--from 3% to .03.
All it's doing--all this

00:34:58.542 --> 00:35:04.009
contract is is an amount--a
promise--to pay the difference

00:35:04.009 --> 00:35:09.380
between the contract and the
actual interest rate on that

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.292
date.
That effectively allows you,

00:35:12.292 --> 00:35:16.336
if you want to borrow at that
rate, to lock in the interest

00:35:16.336 --> 00:35:20.310
rate today because I will get an
amount of money from this

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:24.563
contract that will offset any
changes in interest rates in the

00:35:24.563 --> 00:35:28.437
future.
That's another example of a

00:35:28.437 --> 00:35:32.719
contract.
I wanted to emphasize here

00:35:32.719 --> 00:35:38.110
futures, not--where am I?
Let's talk about futures prices.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:42.593
I took this from an old
newspaper--it's from an old

00:35:42.593 --> 00:35:45.900
lecture.
This is what used to be in

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:51.185
The Wall Street Journal
and this is an example of a

00:35:51.185 --> 00:35:54.750
futures contract.
I'm going to stick here with

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:58.170
agricultural futures and next
lecture we're going to talk

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:02.050
about financial futures.
But, I'd like to talk about

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:06.760
agricultural futures because
it's just really expanding on

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.570
the Japan, Osaka,
Dojima story.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:14.600
It's so earthy--agriculture,
down-to-earth--I like to start

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.369
with that because it seems very
simple to understand.

00:36:19.369 --> 00:36:24.276
I wanted to explain one
contract and I thought I would

00:36:24.276 --> 00:36:31.161
emphasize corn.
This is as it was laid out in

00:36:31.161 --> 00:36:33.690
2001;
that was seven years ago.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:37.084
I was giving these lectures
seven years ago and I clipped it

00:36:37.084 --> 00:36:39.527
out;
that was before--I must have

00:36:39.527 --> 00:36:43.797
covered it earlier in the
semester because I have March 15

00:36:43.797 --> 00:36:48.186
up there and we're now April 14.
But, we'll just use this just

00:36:48.186 --> 00:36:51.659
as an--I'll show you in a second
what you can get today.

00:36:51.659 --> 00:36:55.562
Newspapers, just seven years
ago, covered lots more financial

00:36:55.562 --> 00:36:59.659
data than they do today because
we're moving to the Internet.

00:36:59.659 --> 00:37:02.084
Of course, they had the
Internet in 2001,

00:37:02.084 --> 00:37:05.842
but we weren't so into it then,
so they still published this in

00:37:05.842 --> 00:37:08.630
The Wall Street Journal
as of 2001.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:11.290
So, let me just use this as an
example.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:15.720
What is this?
This is corn;

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.612
that's maize.
It was--what this means is that

00:37:19.612 --> 00:37:24.894
one contract is a contract to
deliver 5,000 bushels and the

00:37:24.894 --> 00:37:28.810
price here is shown in cents per
bushel.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:34.239
These are the contracts;
there is a--now this is--today

00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:38.162
is March 15,2001;
there's a May contract,

00:37:38.162 --> 00:37:42.297
a July contract,
and this is--this shows the

00:37:42.297 --> 00:37:46.530
price over today,
which is March 15,2001.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.768
The guys in the pit at
the--this stands for Chicago

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:53.739
Board of Trade.
I put an O in it,

00:37:53.739 --> 00:38:00.318
but often they just say CBT.
There's a corn pit with traders

00:38:00.318 --> 00:38:06.719
and there might be 50 guys
there--guys and girls.

00:38:06.719 --> 00:38:11.963
It's a rough--my colleague
Ronit Walny worked in the

00:38:11.963 --> 00:38:18.440
futures pits in Chicago and she
told me that it was so rough;

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:22.570
she got pregnant and there
was--she was still coming into

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:26.847
work and she got knocked over
one day by one of the traders

00:38:26.847 --> 00:38:30.038
and her boss said,
no way you have to take a

00:38:30.038 --> 00:38:34.002
vacation until the baby is born.
This is no place for a pregnant

00:38:34.002 --> 00:38:36.120
woman.
It's true;

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.186
they get rough and tumble there.
When I had a tour of the

00:38:40.186 --> 00:38:45.168
CBOT--this was like ten years
ago--I was asking--I was

00:38:45.168 --> 00:38:48.624
observing;
the guys in the pit were so

00:38:48.624 --> 00:38:53.425
raucous and at one point one
trader got another trader in a

00:38:53.425 --> 00:38:58.225
head lock and he was dragging
him around and I think it was

00:38:58.225 --> 00:39:01.219
all in fun,
at that time anyway.

00:39:01.219 --> 00:39:04.187
So, the guy said,
well we had a good record this

00:39:04.187 --> 00:39:06.711
year;
we've had only two broken arms

00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:09.070
this year and that's a good
year.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:13.299
In Chicago, they're not
as--they're farmers--I shouldn't

00:39:13.299 --> 00:39:15.300
put them down;
they're different;

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.835
they have a different spirit.
They're not--they're

00:39:17.835 --> 00:39:19.340
down-to-earth,
real people;

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.141
let's put it that way.
It's fun to watch,

00:39:22.141 --> 00:39:25.900
but unfortunately it's probably
too late.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.627
Unless you go to the Treasury
bond pit, it's all fading away

00:39:30.627 --> 00:39:34.852
onto the Internet.
What this means is these were

00:39:34.852 --> 00:39:40.097
the prices that corn took per
bushel over that day of March

00:39:40.097 --> 00:39:43.353
15.
So, the price was going up and

00:39:43.353 --> 00:39:46.519
down as they were trading all
day.

00:39:46.519 --> 00:39:49.303
This was the opening price when
the market opened in the

00:39:49.303 --> 00:39:51.965
morning;
this was the highest price for

00:39:51.965 --> 00:39:55.179
May futures;
this was the lowest price.

00:39:55.179 --> 00:39:59.150
And this is called the settle,
which is essentially the last

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:02.650
price, but not necessarily
because the exchange has a

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:06.352
settlement committee and they
decide on what is the last

00:40:06.352 --> 00:40:08.607
price.
The reason it's not the same

00:40:08.607 --> 00:40:11.657
thing as the last actual trade
is that they're worried about

00:40:11.657 --> 00:40:14.707
somebody trying to manipulate
the market and doing something

00:40:14.707 --> 00:40:19.559
funny with the last trade.
It's like the last trade.

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:24.110
So, this is the change from the
previous day of the price.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:28.150
This is the price for May
delivery at a specified

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:35.420
warehouse of corn to Chicago.
Open interest is the number of

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:39.416
contracts.
There were 186,000 May

00:40:39.416 --> 00:40:41.912
contracts;
that's only two months

00:40:41.912 --> 00:40:43.449
away--March, April,
May.

00:40:43.449 --> 00:40:46.739
Almost all of the open interest
is in the short contracts.

00:40:46.739 --> 00:40:52.086
Now, if you drive through the
country and turn on the radio,

00:40:52.086 --> 00:40:56.889
you will hear at regular
intervals--the announcer will

00:40:56.889 --> 00:41:02.764
tell you what corn is doing.
They say, corn at the latest

00:41:02.764 --> 00:41:09.320
trading is up to $2.18 a bushel.
What price is that guy quoting?

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.769
It's always going to be the
futures price.

00:41:12.769 --> 00:41:15.141
You might say,
well that's two months in the

00:41:15.141 --> 00:41:17.236
future--March,
April, May--why are they

00:41:17.236 --> 00:41:20.009
talking about May?
Because this is March,

00:41:20.009 --> 00:41:24.263
why doesn't the announcer tells
us that at some warehouse the

00:41:24.263 --> 00:41:26.888
price today was?
The reason is that,

00:41:26.888 --> 00:41:30.052
as I was saying,
those prices are not meaningful

00:41:30.052 --> 00:41:33.350
because they jump around because
of crazy reasons,

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:35.100
so this is the price.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:48.623
The other thing that I want to
emphasize is that these markets

00:41:48.623 --> 00:41:54.739
are used to manage risks of
holding or raising grain.

00:41:54.739 --> 00:41:58.367
Most of the time,
people who are trading in this

00:41:58.367 --> 00:42:01.300
market do not complete the
contract.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.660
In other words,
if I--let's say I'm a farmer

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:09.036
raising corn and I'm worried
that the price of corn might

00:42:09.036 --> 00:42:12.710
fall while I'm raising it and I
lose money.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:17.939
If the world market for corn
drops, then I might not be able

00:42:17.939 --> 00:42:23.699
to cover my expenses this year
and so I could be at great risk.

00:42:23.699 --> 00:42:28.253
So, I can sell in the futures
market, but I probably won't

00:42:28.253 --> 00:42:31.920
deliver to the futures market.
Why not?

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.411
Because the delivery point is
in Chicago and I'm a farmer in

00:42:36.411 --> 00:42:40.446
Iowa and I don't know how to
deliver it all the way to

00:42:40.446 --> 00:42:43.599
Chicago.
I'd have to rent trucks and

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:47.239
drive to Chicago with my corn;
I'm not going to do that.

00:42:47.239 --> 00:42:50.500
I'm always just delivering to
the local grain elevator.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.679
In fact, I don't have to--I
don't need any trucks;

00:42:52.679 --> 00:42:56.885
the guy will pick it up from my
farm, so that's what I want to

00:42:56.885 --> 00:42:59.734
do.
What I do typically is I sell

00:42:59.734 --> 00:43:02.844
in the futures market,
I as a farmer,

00:43:02.844 --> 00:43:06.989
and then one day before the
contract expires,

00:43:06.989 --> 00:43:10.382
instead of delivering,
I will buy it back and cancel

00:43:10.382 --> 00:43:13.827
out my contract.
So, all I've done is a purely

00:43:13.827 --> 00:43:17.250
financial trade in the future.
Do you see the difference?

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.951
I don't actually want to
deliver because it's too much

00:43:20.951 --> 00:43:24.374
trouble to deliver,
so you get farmers trading all

00:43:24.374 --> 00:43:28.425
over the country and all over
the world in this market as a

00:43:28.425 --> 00:43:33.163
way of hedging their corn.
Very few of them will ever

00:43:33.163 --> 00:43:36.770
deliver.
The only reason why delivery is

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:42.162
kept open as an option is that
is what determines the price in

00:43:42.162 --> 00:43:45.904
the market.
Ultimately, the only people who

00:43:45.904 --> 00:43:50.427
deliver are professional
arbitragers, who on the last day

00:43:50.427 --> 00:43:53.820
or right when the contract is
expiring,

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:56.079
they look at the futures price
and they say,

00:43:56.079 --> 00:43:58.707
maybe I can deliver it,
maybe I can buy it for less

00:43:58.707 --> 00:44:01.230
than that and deliver and I'll
really do it.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:05.181
Those are the only people;
so, if they can buy for less

00:44:05.181 --> 00:44:07.679
than that and deliver,
they'll do it.

00:44:07.679 --> 00:44:12.058
They compete with each other
and that brings the futures

00:44:12.058 --> 00:44:15.719
price and the spot price in line
at the end.

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:19.013
Alternatively,
if the spot price is above the

00:44:19.013 --> 00:44:22.905
futures price at the end,
then these arbitragers will

00:44:22.905 --> 00:44:27.137
say, hey I'll take delivery.
I'll go there and take delivery

00:44:27.137 --> 00:44:30.219
on a contract and then I'll sell
it and make money.

00:44:30.219 --> 00:44:35.217
It's because of the arbitragers
that the cash price and the spot

00:44:35.217 --> 00:44:40.791
price line up at the end;
it's not through any law

00:44:40.791 --> 00:44:44.469
requirement.
You see what people are doing?

00:44:44.469 --> 00:44:47.530
They're using the futures
market as a purely financial

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.704
market.
Most people rely on the

00:44:50.704 --> 00:44:57.284
arbitragers to enforce the
futures price converging on the

00:44:57.284 --> 00:45:01.563
spot price at the end.
Most people are not even

00:45:01.563 --> 00:45:03.769
raising the right kind of corn
maybe;

00:45:03.769 --> 00:45:06.389
I don't know how--a lot of them
certainly aren't.

00:45:06.389 --> 00:45:07.650
There are all different kinds
of corn.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:12.349
If you are raising one kind of
corn and are hedging your risks

00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:17.050
with a different kind of corn,
that's called cross-hedging.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:26.766
That means across products;
I'm going from one product to

00:45:26.766 --> 00:45:29.180
another.
So, I could be raising some of

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.591
this beautiful Indian corn
that--remember it turns all

00:45:32.591 --> 00:45:36.324
these different colors and
people hang it on their doors at

00:45:36.324 --> 00:45:40.250
Halloween--that's not suitable
for delivery at the CBOT.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:43.951
If I'm raising that,
there's no market--it's no

00:45:43.951 --> 00:45:47.010
future--it's no big market for
that,

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:49.305
but it probably correlates with
regular corn,

00:45:49.305 --> 00:45:52.252
so I could cross-hedge.
If I'm raising Indian corn and

00:45:52.252 --> 00:45:55.153
I'm worried about the price,
I can sell in the futures

00:45:55.153 --> 00:45:57.889
market in Chicago and buy it
back the next day.

00:45:57.889 --> 00:46:01.208
I said I was going to show you
what's in The Wall Street

00:46:01.208 --> 00:46:03.344
Journal.
I got this this morning from

00:46:03.344 --> 00:46:06.650
The Wall Street Journal;
that's all they have for

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:10.507
futures markets in the
newspaper, unless I missed it,

00:46:10.507 --> 00:46:13.147
I couldn't find it.
Commodities and

00:46:13.147 --> 00:46:17.244
currencies--they don't have any
agricultural futures mentioned

00:46:17.244 --> 00:46:20.199
at all in The Wall Street
Journal.

00:46:20.199 --> 00:46:24.261
As I'm going to talk about next
period, most futures have

00:46:24.261 --> 00:46:27.090
migrated to financial futures
anyway.

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:30.320
It's the same idea,
but it's not agricultural.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.240
I don't see anything
agricultural up here.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.903
There are commodities;
there's crude oil,

00:46:35.903 --> 00:46:39.878
natural gas,
gold--everything else is purely

00:46:39.878 --> 00:46:42.237
financial.
Well actually,

00:46:42.237 --> 00:46:45.380
you've got the DJIIG Commodity
Index;

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:49.079
that's an index of a number of
prices, probably including

00:46:49.079 --> 00:46:53.820
agricultural.
So, that's traded;

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.812
lots more is traded.
I went down to CBOT.com this

00:46:57.812 --> 00:47:01.659
morning and I got wheat futures
prices.

00:47:01.659 --> 00:47:06.965
This is on their website and
you don't need any special

00:47:06.965 --> 00:47:11.275
permission to get on CBOT.com.
They're actually changing the

00:47:11.275 --> 00:47:15.070
name of the website though;
I think it will be CMEgroup.com

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:20.409
because of their merger with the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

00:47:20.409 --> 00:47:22.869
This is the same thing that we
just saw.

00:47:22.869 --> 00:47:28.099
This is the price of a bushel
of wheat;

00:47:28.099 --> 00:47:42.980
this is as of last
Friday--$.932 a bushel.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:48.529
It ranged from $.885;
it closed at its high--it

00:47:48.529 --> 00:47:52.754
opened at its high and it
settled down,

00:47:52.754 --> 00:47:58.174
so wheat went down.
This is for delivery in May of

00:47:58.174 --> 00:48:02.239
2008 and these contracts go out
to 2010.

00:48:02.239 --> 00:48:05.222
This doesn't shown open
interest, but you understand

00:48:05.222 --> 00:48:09.331
what this is?
Now, the real--the price that

00:48:09.331 --> 00:48:15.794
we talk about when we talk about
commodities is the futures

00:48:15.794 --> 00:48:23.073
price, overwhelmingly.
This is the Chicago Board of

00:48:23.073 --> 00:48:30.679
Trade price for corn since 1929.
We could take it even further

00:48:30.679 --> 00:48:35.697
back, but futures exchanges have
been going since--the CBOT goes

00:48:35.697 --> 00:48:40.404
back to the 1860s.
Anyway, this is a long time

00:48:40.404 --> 00:48:46.921
horizon plot of the price of
corn and I adjusted it for CPI

00:48:46.921 --> 00:48:52.539
inflation, so this shows in
dollars per bushel.

00:48:52.539 --> 00:48:55.145
Of course, contracts are for
5,000 bushels,

00:48:55.145 --> 00:48:58.309
so you'd have to multiply these
numbers by 5,000.

00:48:58.309 --> 00:49:04.516
This just shows what has been
happening to the real price of

00:49:04.516 --> 00:49:08.500
corn since 1929.
There's a lot of talk recently;

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.539
you must have heard it--about
this spike up.

00:49:11.539 --> 00:49:14.489
In fact, it's quite a hefty
spike up;

00:49:14.489 --> 00:49:17.676
it's doubled--more than doubled
in real terms in just the last

00:49:17.676 --> 00:49:19.989
couple years.
Do you know why this is?

00:49:19.989 --> 00:49:22.830
Why is corn getting expensive
right now?

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:26.230
What's that?
That's the theory;

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:33.535
I think it's right--that it's
because oil prices are getting

00:49:33.535 --> 00:49:40.594
high and because we can make
alternative fuels out of food

00:49:40.594 --> 00:49:45.991
stuffs--cane or corn.
In response to the high oil

00:49:45.991 --> 00:49:50.253
prices, well also subsidies for
ethanol production,

00:49:50.253 --> 00:49:54.090
corn is being demanded to run
automobiles.

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:59.973
All these rich people who want
their SUVs--they want to have a

00:49:59.973 --> 00:50:05.856
good drive--are now paying more
for the corn and bidding it up

00:50:05.856 --> 00:50:10.099
and this is a huge international
crisis.

00:50:10.099 --> 00:50:14.816
It's spreading over all of the
grains and it's a worrisome

00:50:14.816 --> 00:50:19.698
situation because people in some
of the poorest parts of the

00:50:19.698 --> 00:50:24.580
world cannot tolerate a doubling
of the price of grain;

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:29.638
they'll starve.
This is a huge moral issue that

00:50:29.638 --> 00:50:33.612
we're facing right now.
In order to keep our cars

00:50:33.612 --> 00:50:36.920
going, we're driving some people
to starvation.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.854
On the other hand,
I don't mean to minimize that,

00:50:40.854 --> 00:50:45.772
I thought it was interesting to
look at the whole run of corn

00:50:45.772 --> 00:50:50.227
prices back to 1929;
they have come down a great

00:50:50.227 --> 00:50:52.672
deal.
It's quite curious,

00:50:52.672 --> 00:50:58.466
if you correct for inflation;
it was like $15 a bushel in

00:50:58.466 --> 00:50:59.943
1950.
On top of that,

00:50:59.943 --> 00:51:03.471
our incomes have risen and so I
think this says something about

00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:06.715
why futures--agricultural
futures--are not as prominent as

00:51:06.715 --> 00:51:09.836
they used to be.
It used to be that food was

00:51:09.836 --> 00:51:14.260
really a lot more expensive and
a bigger share of our income.

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:17.579
We live in a very plenteous
time;

00:51:17.579 --> 00:51:19.730
this is very unusual by
historical standards.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:22.820
Right now, you just eat
whatever you want;

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.740
you don't even look at the
price;

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.030
it's all so cheap.
Maybe you do;

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:30.279
maybe you don't eat caviar
because of price,

00:51:30.279 --> 00:51:34.510
but we're just in a time of
plenty with the real price of

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:37.635
food so low.
It's not normal times,

00:51:37.635 --> 00:51:41.467
historically,
so our agricultural futures are

00:51:41.467 --> 00:51:46.860
somewhat downplayed.
I wanted to give an example of

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:52.961
wheat futures because this
is--we have a reading on the

00:51:52.961 --> 00:51:57.030
reading list by Holbrook
Working.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:52:01.702
Holbrook Working was the great
theorist of futures markets and

00:52:01.702 --> 00:52:05.992
it's actually--the reading comes
from the 1950s and he is

00:52:05.992 --> 00:52:10.300
explaining futures market.
I like this article because it

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:14.054
sets it forth very well and
nothing has changed since the

00:52:14.054 --> 00:52:17.539
1950s except that the markets
are electronic now.

00:52:17.539 --> 00:52:22.332
I wanted to focus in on one
futures market and this is the

00:52:22.332 --> 00:52:26.380
market for wheat.
These are the standards for

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:30.010
delivery at the Chicago Board of
Trade.

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:32.490
I got this off their website
and this current;

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:36.779
this is today.
If you--one contract is 5,000

00:52:36.779 --> 00:52:40.443
bushels.
They will accept a number of

00:52:40.443 --> 00:52:45.908
different kinds of wheat that
meet their--there must be some

00:52:45.908 --> 00:52:51.280
standards for quality--no bugs
in it and whatever else--but

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:56.745
they'll accept number two soft
red winter or number two hard

00:52:56.745 --> 00:53:02.210
red winter or--I just copied
this from the--it says,

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:06.474
no dark northern spring.
It must be number something,

00:53:06.474 --> 00:53:09.298
what happened?
I must have lost the--number

00:53:09.298 --> 00:53:12.440
two, northern spring.
All those are at par.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:17.440
However, you can also deliver
number one soft red winter.

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.977
That's different because this
is number two soft red

00:53:20.977 --> 00:53:24.792
winter--or number one hard red
winter or number one dark

00:53:24.792 --> 00:53:28.329
northern spring and number one
northern spring;

00:53:28.329 --> 00:53:31.409
you get $.03 a bushel over the
contract price.

00:53:31.409 --> 00:53:37.548
What they're trying to do is
recognize that there are so many

00:53:37.548 --> 00:53:43.278
different kinds of wheat and so
I thought we would remind

00:53:43.278 --> 00:53:49.720
ourselves of what they are.
One hard--soft wheat is used

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:55.909
for making biscuits and
breakfast cereals and cakes;

00:53:55.909 --> 00:53:59.230
hard wheat is used for making
bread.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:02.634
If you do baking,
you should not just always use

00:54:02.634 --> 00:54:05.965
all-purpose flour,
you should get the different

00:54:05.965 --> 00:54:08.789
varieties.
That's what is being mentioned

00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:13.807
here--these different varieties.
I wanted to--let me see,

00:54:13.807 --> 00:54:20.239
I wanted to talk about the
Holbrook Working paper.

00:54:20.239 --> 00:54:30.417
Holbrook Working talks about
winter--is anyone here who is a

00:54:30.417 --> 00:54:35.039
farmer?
Did anyone grow up on a farm?

00:54:35.039 --> 00:54:37.900
Can anyone tell the story of
winter wheat?

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:41.747
Nobody?
We're not very down-to-earth

00:54:41.747 --> 00:54:46.820
people here, are we?
There are two plantings;

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:48.550
there's winter wheat and spring
wheat.

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:52.613
Winter wheat--you plant it in
the winter and you harvest it in

00:54:52.613 --> 00:54:55.060
the spring.
It stays in the ground all

00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:58.464
winter and it comes up first
thing in the--it's coming up

00:54:58.464 --> 00:55:00.695
now.
You harvest winter wheat in

00:55:00.695 --> 00:55:03.570
May, so we're almost close to
the harvest.

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:07.347
Did you know that?
There are amber waves of grain

00:55:07.347 --> 00:55:12.593
blowing in the wind out there in
the wheat belt right now and it

00:55:12.593 --> 00:55:17.090
will soon be harvested in
another month and a half.

00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:20.572
Spring wheat--you plant it in
the spring and you harvest it in

00:55:20.572 --> 00:55:22.650
the fall.
But they're allowing now

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:26.208
delivery of either one.
When Holbrook Working wrote the

00:55:26.208 --> 00:55:30.084
paper, there was a separate
contract for hard winter wheat

00:55:30.084 --> 00:55:34.301
and so I think that there's some
consolidation of these markets

00:55:34.301 --> 00:55:38.110
as agricultural futures is
becoming less important.

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:42.311
That's why we just have--this
is the only CBOT wheat market

00:55:42.311 --> 00:55:46.647
that's listed now.
You understand what the

00:55:46.647 --> 00:55:49.910
contract is?
The contract is to deliver one

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:53.224
of these varieties and there's a
separate contract for each of

00:55:53.224 --> 00:56:00.949
these dates.
What is the pricing?

00:56:00.949 --> 00:56:03.659
This is the thing--what is the
futures price?

00:56:03.659 --> 00:56:09.539
Now there's--this is what I'm
going to try to conclude on.

00:56:09.539 --> 00:56:13.969
It depends on whether wheat is
in storage or not.

00:56:13.969 --> 00:56:18.019
Normally, wheat is in storage
because we only harvest a

00:56:18.019 --> 00:56:22.445
particular variety once a year
and we have to consume it all

00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:25.330
year.
So, after the harvest the

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:30.460
warehouses get full and then
they're brimming with wheat.

00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:34.983
Then, as the year goes down,
the warehouses deplete their

00:56:34.983 --> 00:56:39.829
contents of wheat and it hits
zero right when the new harvest

00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:43.009
comes in.
Then, it all gets put back into

00:56:43.009 --> 00:56:45.510
the warehouse.
This is a physical necessity.

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:52.126
When there is wheat in storage,
normally, most of the time,

00:56:52.126 --> 00:56:57.662
this relation should hold.
The price of the futures

00:56:57.662 --> 00:57:02.933
contract should equal the spot
price times one plus the

00:57:02.933 --> 00:57:07.130
interest rate,
between now and delivery.

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:11.373
That means that if,
say interest rates are 5% a

00:57:11.373 --> 00:57:16.723
year and the delivery is in six
months, then this should be

00:57:16.723 --> 00:57:20.957
.025--half of a year.
I want to--it's not annual

00:57:20.957 --> 00:57:23.727
interest rate;
it's the interest rate until

00:57:23.727 --> 00:57:26.397
delivery.
If it's a third of a year,

00:57:26.397 --> 00:57:30.312
you divide by whatever
the--it's the interest from

00:57:30.312 --> 00:57:35.156
today until delivery date.
S is the cost of storage

00:57:35.156 --> 00:57:38.090
from today until the delivery
date.

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:47.340
This should hold normally all
the time and why is that?

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:51.579
Because if I'm running a
warehouse storing grain,

00:57:51.579 --> 00:57:56.790
I can either sell at the spot
price or I I can always unload

00:57:56.790 --> 00:58:02.178
my warehouse and sell it today
or I can wait and deliver it in

00:58:02.178 --> 00:58:05.800
the future at the futures
contract.

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:10.973
Today, as a warehouse,
I'm losing money because of the

00:58:10.973 --> 00:58:14.841
cost of storage.
I have to pay insurance and I

00:58:14.841 --> 00:58:18.772
have to do other things that
maintain the quality of my

00:58:18.772 --> 00:58:22.064
storage and that's S.
On top of that,

00:58:22.064 --> 00:58:25.858
I'm losing on interest because
if I'm storing the grain,

00:58:25.858 --> 00:58:29.791
I'm not getting interest on the
money that I paid for that

00:58:29.791 --> 00:58:32.800
grain;
that's another loss to me.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:36.480
So, this is the break even for
storing grain.

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.674
If the futures price is enough
above the spot price that it

00:58:40.674 --> 00:58:43.928
pays for my interest cost and my
storage cost,

00:58:43.928 --> 00:58:49.279
I'm making money storing grain.
If the futures price is below

00:58:49.279 --> 00:58:52.780
this, I'm not going to store
grain;

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.396
I'll unload my warehouse.
Why should I store grain for

00:58:55.396 --> 00:58:58.353
another minute?
If I'm a professional warehouse

00:58:58.353 --> 00:59:02.668
offer and I see that I can make
more money by selling my grain

00:59:02.668 --> 00:59:06.992
today, then I will do it.
Conversely, if the futures

00:59:06.992 --> 00:59:12.488
price is above the spot price,
then I'm going to want to store

00:59:12.488 --> 00:59:15.458
more grain.
I'm going to go out and buy up

00:59:15.458 --> 00:59:19.159
other grain and that's going to
tend to force the spot price up.

00:59:19.159 --> 00:59:23.594
So, this relationship tends to
hold almost all the time or you

00:59:23.594 --> 00:59:28.320
might say it holds all the time,
if you interpret it correctly.

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:32.880
Normally, the futures price is
above the cash price because

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:37.675
interest rates are positive and
storage costs are positive and

00:59:37.675 --> 00:59:42.103
it has to be that way.
The normal course of grain

00:59:42.103 --> 00:59:47.970
prices over the harvest year is
to rise as the year progresses.

00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:52.800
It has to be that way;
the grain is cheapest right

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:58.089
after the harvest when there's
lots of grain around and then

00:59:58.089 --> 01:00:03.557
the grain price goes up steadily
throughout the year until the

01:00:03.557 --> 01:00:07.860
new harvest comes in and then it
collapses.

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:15.889
The price of grain over the
year is a sawtooth pattern.

01:00:15.889 --> 01:00:27.691
If there's nothing interfering
with it, the price of grain will

01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:37.590
tend to look like this and these
are the harvests.

01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:42.235
The reason the price of grain
is going up between harvests is

01:00:42.235 --> 01:00:45.099
to compensate the warehouse
owners.

01:00:45.099 --> 01:00:47.849
They're not going to do this
business if they're not getting

01:00:47.849 --> 01:00:50.179
compensated, so this is almost
like an iron law.

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:53.881
This is going to hold,
but it doesn't necessarily hold

01:00:53.881 --> 01:00:57.861
in a given year because there
are other things that affect

01:00:57.861 --> 01:01:01.130
price.
This is what I was saying--that

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:06.358
arbitrage enforces fair value.
There is a problem if there is

01:01:06.358 --> 01:01:09.017
no grain in storage.
For example,

01:01:09.017 --> 01:01:12.603
right at the harvest end when
the harvest is coming in,

01:01:12.603 --> 01:01:16.456
the relation between futures
and spot price can become very

01:01:16.456 --> 01:01:19.515
erratic.
The futures price can be way

01:01:19.515 --> 01:01:22.710
below the fair value;
the right hand side--spot times

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:25.320
one plus R plus
S--is called fair value.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.929
Futures can be below fair value
and there's no way for arbitrage

01:01:30.929 --> 01:01:35.915
to make up the difference
because there's nothing--if the

01:01:35.915 --> 01:01:40.907
futures were very low,
you would want to take money

01:01:40.907 --> 01:01:46.263
out of--take grain out of
storage and sell it on the spot

01:01:46.263 --> 01:01:48.315
market.
If there is no grain in

01:01:48.315 --> 01:01:52.031
storage, you can't do that.
It sometimes happens when the

01:01:52.031 --> 01:01:56.960
grain is not in storage that the
price of the future is below

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.893
fair value.
There's another interpretation

01:01:59.893 --> 01:02:01.314
of it.
People would say,

01:02:01.314 --> 01:02:04.802
well but there is still some
grain in storage--it's not gone

01:02:04.802 --> 01:02:07.801
everywhere.
So, how can it sometimes be

01:02:07.801 --> 01:02:11.340
that the futures price is below
fair value?

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:16.745
Well, you might say--and this
is that--you could either say

01:02:16.745 --> 01:02:22.523
that sometimes the relationship
between price and fair value is

01:02:22.523 --> 01:02:27.036
violated or you could say,
no it's never violated,

01:02:27.036 --> 01:02:30.320
but sometimes the storage cost
is negative.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:34.663
So, we have something called a
convenience yield,

01:02:34.663 --> 01:02:37.829
which is a negative storage
cost.

01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:43.508
Suppose you are a corn merchant
and you're noting that right now

01:02:43.508 --> 01:02:47.835
the market is in
backwardation--the futures price

01:02:47.835 --> 01:02:52.577
is less than the spot price.
So, you're thinking,

01:02:52.577 --> 01:02:58.244
I want to get grain somehow and
sell it on the spot market and

01:02:58.244 --> 01:03:01.972
I'll make money.
You go around trying to find

01:03:01.972 --> 01:03:06.246
someone to sell you grain and
you find that someone has it and

01:03:06.246 --> 01:03:09.750
won't sell it to you and you
say, well why not?

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:13.440
The guy will say,
because I need this grain.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.570
Who has grain when the market
is in backwardation?

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:19.059
It's somebody who really needs
it.

01:03:19.059 --> 01:03:22.120
For example,
in the case of wheat,

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:27.685
you might find that you go to
the factory that makes Wheaties

01:03:27.685 --> 01:03:31.887
and you say,
I'd like to buy your

01:03:31.887 --> 01:03:38.680
wheat--noting that the spot
price is really high.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.829
You won't tell him that;
you say, I just want to buy

01:03:40.829 --> 01:03:44.164
your wheat.
Whatever you've got,

01:03:44.164 --> 01:03:51.469
I'll buy it at the--you
shouldn't put it that way.

01:03:51.469 --> 01:03:55.937
I guess I'm saying that it's
not going to work if you do--why

01:03:55.937 --> 01:03:59.660
doesn't the Wheaties
manufacturer sell its grain on

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:03.599
the spot market?
The reason is that they need

01:04:03.599 --> 01:04:08.847
wheat to make Wheaties and so
for them they want to have some

01:04:08.847 --> 01:04:10.776
on hand.
They might think,

01:04:10.776 --> 01:04:14.015
well if we didn't have any
storage of wheat we would be at

01:04:14.015 --> 01:04:17.368
the mercy of delivery and who
knows when--the harvest is out

01:04:17.368 --> 01:04:19.378
now,
we might not be able to get any

01:04:19.378 --> 01:04:22.279
wheat and we may have to shut
our whole factory down and tell

01:04:22.279 --> 01:04:25.864
everyone to take a day off.
That costs us a lot of money,

01:04:25.864 --> 01:04:30.060
so we really need to have wheat
in storage at the Wheaties

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.380
factory.
When the market is in

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:38.761
backwardation,
the only grain that's stored is

01:04:38.761 --> 01:04:44.739
the grain that's there for
convenience purpose.

01:04:44.739 --> 01:04:49.059
I'm just going to go through
the example that Holbrook

01:04:49.059 --> 01:04:52.889
Working gives in his reading,
which you have.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:57.321
Back then, there was a number
two hard winter wheat Kansas

01:04:57.321 --> 01:05:00.120
City future--maybe there still
is;

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:06.148
I don't know, but not at CBOT.
We're going to do this 1956 or

01:05:06.148 --> 01:05:11.868
1957 story--I have it here.
Hard wheat is used for bread,

01:05:11.868 --> 01:05:14.800
soft wheat for--remember,
this a cooking tip.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:20.524
You can buy bread flour at the
grocery store and you can buy

01:05:20.524 --> 01:05:23.920
cake flour and they're
different.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:28.834
Holbrook Working is just
talking about what happens in a

01:05:28.834 --> 01:05:32.139
typical year for hard winter
wheat.

01:05:32.139 --> 01:05:38.528
So, we're starting out now with
July 2, typical year,

01:05:38.528 --> 01:05:44.469
spot wheat was $2.29 a bushel;
that's the price on July 2.

01:05:44.469 --> 01:05:49.238
The September future is $2.32 a
bushel, so the difference

01:05:49.238 --> 01:05:53.580
between the future and the spot
is called the basis,

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:57.875
which is $.03 a bushel.
Another term is spot premium,

01:05:57.875 --> 01:06:01.728
but that would be minus $.03,
but that's--let's just talk

01:06:01.728 --> 01:06:05.015
about basis.
The basis is the futures price

01:06:05.015 --> 01:06:11.599
minus the spot price.
This is just a typical story.

01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:13.959
So, the futures price is
selling for higher,

01:06:13.959 --> 01:06:16.154
as it should be,
because between July and

01:06:16.154 --> 01:06:19.949
September, this is winter wheat.
The harvest is recently in;

01:06:19.949 --> 01:06:24.160
the harvest came in in May and
so this is when there's a lot in

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:28.506
storage and we really should see
the futures price above the spot

01:06:28.506 --> 01:06:33.848
price and indeed we do.
This spot premium is the profit

01:06:33.848 --> 01:06:37.809
that is offered to the
warehouser.

01:06:37.809 --> 01:06:40.364
The warehouser looks at
this--or the basis--the

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:43.363
warehouser--people in the
warehouse business are always

01:06:43.363 --> 01:06:46.362
watching this every day and
they're looking always at a

01:06:46.362 --> 01:06:48.639
basis of $.03 and they're
thinking,

01:06:48.639 --> 01:06:51.280
are we going to make money on
that, because they have costs.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.940
But, this is how much more they
can sell it in the future than

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:58.119
they can sell it today,
so they're comparing the basis

01:06:58.119 --> 01:07:00.688
with their costs;
they do that all the time in

01:07:00.688 --> 01:07:03.524
the warehouse business.
Now, September 4--now it's

01:07:03.524 --> 01:07:06.030
still--remember,
the harvest was May;

01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:07.690
we're not anywhere near the
harvest.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:12.961
Now, we still have a basis,
but now the basis has gotten

01:07:12.961 --> 01:07:15.309
smaller;
this is what happens.

01:07:15.309 --> 01:07:18.869
So, the warehouse operator is
starting to feel uncomfortable.

01:07:18.869 --> 01:07:22.269
I was doing really well in
July--I had a basis of 3.

01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:26.083
Now the basis is down to 1,
so it's getting kind of iffy

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:28.510
for me--whether I can make
money.

01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:31.636
Maybe I should sell.
So, they're always watching

01:07:31.636 --> 01:07:34.260
these markets and thinking about
that.

01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:42.247
I'm sorry, I take that back;
I forgot, this is both the

01:07:42.247 --> 01:07:45.441
September future.
So, the basis should get

01:07:45.441 --> 01:07:50.302
smaller because we're getting
closer to the expiration date

01:07:50.302 --> 01:07:53.990
because now it's only one-month
interest.

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:57.590
Well actually, it's even less;
we're almost expiring;

01:07:57.590 --> 01:08:00.170
I wasn't thinking when I first
saw that.

01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:05.689
The basis should shrink to zero
as the time--as you approach the

01:08:05.689 --> 01:08:10.457
expiration of the contract.
Someone in a warehouse who's

01:08:10.457 --> 01:08:15.308
worried about the fluctuation in
the grain will sell it in the

01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:19.842
futures market and then expect
to get the basis because it

01:08:19.842 --> 01:08:23.739
doesn't matter what the price of
grain does;

01:08:23.739 --> 01:08:26.930
the spot and the futures price
should converge.

01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:31.356
The basis should go to zero and
the $.03 a bushel is the profit

01:08:31.356 --> 01:08:34.069
that they make on the futures
trade.

01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:38.481
It's riskless for them at the
warehouse because they're

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:43.627
hedging the price risk and then
it becomes a nice clean and easy

01:08:43.627 --> 01:08:46.699
business.
So, I'm looking in July 2 to

01:08:46.699 --> 01:08:49.569
see what are my costs at the
warehouse.

01:08:49.569 --> 01:08:53.692
I'm looking at this basis and I
think if I can keep my costs

01:08:53.692 --> 01:08:56.736
under $.03 a bushel,
including interest,

01:08:56.736 --> 01:09:01.651
then I will make money because
this basis is converging to zero

01:09:01.651 --> 01:09:06.328
at the end for sure--or the
stock premium will go from minus

01:09:06.328 --> 01:09:09.420
3 to 0--so this is a normal
month.

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:13.069
Some months storing grain had
this basis of $.03 a bushel and

01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:16.536
is doing business as usual,
storing for less than that and

01:09:16.536 --> 01:09:18.816
making money.
If not less than that,

01:09:18.816 --> 01:09:23.405
then get out of it.
Then, continuing through the

01:09:23.405 --> 01:09:29.821
year--now they roll into
December futures because I'm

01:09:29.821 --> 01:09:34.220
still storing grain;
I do this all year.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:38.024
I'm trading in the nearest
month contract because that's

01:09:38.024 --> 01:09:42.520
where the open interest is and
that's where all the trading is.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.698
So, as soon the September
contract expires,

01:09:46.698 --> 01:09:50.180
I don't actually want to
deliver.

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:53.840
I'll sell out and I'll make the
profit, which is the change in

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:56.324
basis.
Now, when it comes to--now,

01:09:56.324 --> 01:09:59.517
September 4,
I've made that profit of $.02 a

01:09:59.517 --> 01:10:02.293
bushel.
The difference between the $.03

01:10:02.293 --> 01:10:06.229
a bushel basis and the $.01 and
now I start a new contract.

01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:09.880
Now, because September is
expiring, I move in.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.897
I roll over into the December
contract and I'm just going to

01:10:13.897 --> 01:10:17.569
do this every contract.
Every three months I'm going to

01:10:17.569 --> 01:10:19.729
roll over into the next
contract.

01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:23.000
In this case--I didn't put the
basis;

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.472
the basis was $.0575 a bushel.
So now, it's looking even

01:10:27.472 --> 01:10:30.329
better here in September.
I mean, it jumps around;

01:10:30.329 --> 01:10:32.919
the basis jumps around with
market conditions,

01:10:32.919 --> 01:10:35.796
but it's looking good now
because I have a basis of

01:10:35.796 --> 01:10:39.669
$.0575.
So, I'll sell my grain again on

01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:45.940
a futures contract and then I
will close it out December when

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:51.665
the--this is December 1 now.
Now the price of wheat has gone

01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:56.396
up a lot from $2.38 to $2.52,
but you know it's not going to

01:10:56.396 --> 01:10:59.595
be profit for me.
I'm not--I hedged it,

01:10:59.595 --> 01:11:03.924
but I'll make the--for me,
the profit is the change in the

01:11:03.924 --> 01:11:07.096
spot premium.
So, I made $.0575 a bushel

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.410
minus my costs.
I'll just stop;

01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:13.370
I know I'm running out of time.
What happens at harvest?

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:17.202
I'm doing this all year.
Finally on May--this is--the

01:11:17.202 --> 01:11:20.789
new harvest is coming in and
look what happens;

01:11:20.789 --> 01:11:26.010
now this market is suddenly in
backwardation.

01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:29.908
Now, look what's happening;
the spot premium is $.18 a

01:11:29.908 --> 01:11:32.590
bushel;
the basis is minus 18.

01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:36.521
If I hold on--if I rolled into
July futures and hold on,

01:11:36.521 --> 01:11:40.810
I'm going to lose really big
time, so I'm out--I'm out of the

01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:43.369
business.
We sell off everything in the

01:11:43.369 --> 01:11:47.064
warehouse and we're done.
This is the process by which

01:11:47.064 --> 01:11:51.931
warehousing is optimized and we
get grain smoothly through the

01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:54.728
year,
but it's the basic principle

01:11:54.728 --> 01:11:58.814
that we'll see in the next
lecture--extends as well to

01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:01.590
other kinds of financial
futures.

01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:05.563
Next period,
we're going to talk about other

01:12:05.563 --> 01:12:10.000
kinds of futures,
including financial futures.

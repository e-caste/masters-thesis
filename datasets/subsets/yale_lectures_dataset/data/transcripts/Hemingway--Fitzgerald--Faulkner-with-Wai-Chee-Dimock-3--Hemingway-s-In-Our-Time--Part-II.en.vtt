WAI CHEE DIMOCK: So
just want to go back very

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:19.367
briefly to Hemingway's letter
to John Dos Passos just to

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:24.400
remind us what we are up
against, this claim on

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.767
Hemingway's part.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:29.100
"A Mrs. George Kauffman
is here.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.733
And she claims they want to cut
it all out-- the Indian

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.867
Camp story.

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:35.167
Cut the In Our Time chapters.

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:37.633
Jesus, I feel all shot
to hell about it.

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:40.667
Of course they can't do it
because the stuff is so tight

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:44.633
and hard and everything hangs
on everything else." So this

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:49.133
is the very recognizable
posture on the part of

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.867
Hemingway that everything is
tight and hard and everything

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:55.167
hangs on everything else.

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:58.633
But giving the publication
history of the various

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:02.767
chapters, and also the stories
published separately, whether

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:06.767
or not there is in fact an
organic unity among them.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.233
That's the big question.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:10.700
And last time we tried
to give Hemingway the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.667
benefit of the doubt.

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:17.033
And we read the end of chapters
and the stories as if

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:22.667
they were indeed organically
integral to one another.

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:27.800
So today we'll try some
other combinations.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.133
But I found this picture of
Hemingway and Dos Passos.

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:37.967
So you know Hemingway is to the
far right and that's Dos

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:40.900
Passos to the far left.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.333
And I always love this.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.933
And they actually both
wrote about war.

00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:51.367
Dos Passos has a novel called
Three Soldiers.

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:54.500
Very, very great novel
about war as well.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.767
So you can see that they
have a lot in common.

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:04.367
And here's another important
letter to Edmund Wilson.

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:07.267
This is slightly earlier.

00:02:07.267 --> 00:02:12.100
"Finished the book of 14 stories
with a chapter in our

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.267
time between each...

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:16.900
to give the picture of
the whole between

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.367
examining it in detail.

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:23.500
Like looking with your eyes at
something, say a passing

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.967
coastline, and then looking
at it with 15x binoculars.

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:34.367
Or rather, maybe, looking at
it and then going in and

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:35.733
living in it--

00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:39.433
and then coming out and
looking at it again...

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:42.867
it has a pretty good unity."
So once again, that

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:46.633
all-important word for
Hemingway, pretty good unity.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.133
And that's a very
strong claim.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:51.067
It's not really pretty
good, it's damn good.

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:56.667
But in any case, what's new
about this description is the

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:58.933
idea of zooming in and
zooming out, right?

00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:00.667
So this is very much
the approach

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:02.600
that we've been taking.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.267
And we've been thinking
of it in terms of

00:03:05.267 --> 00:03:07.067
micro and macro, right?

00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:10.667
So this, the first set
the terms that

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:12.667
we started out with.

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:19.667
And today I'd like to add a few
more terms that line up in

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:20.433
a similar way.

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.733
Obviously, not the same.

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:25.233
But they're kind of
interrelated.

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:31.233
So micro, macro obviously, up
close, from a distance.

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:32.633
Before and after.

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:35.533
And that's especially important
when a soldier is

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:36.800
coming back home.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.300
What happened during the war.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.467
What happened after the war.

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:44.267
And going along with that
intensity of the experience

00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:45.933
when you're in the war.

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:49.200
And as we know from the story
"Soldier's Home," the

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.767
staleness of it when
you come back.

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:55.633
And then another pair of terms
very important to our class,

00:03:55.633 --> 00:03:59.100
actually, is tragedy
and comedy.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.533
Since this is a writing class,
I also want to stop for just

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:07.467
one minute and talk about this
as a kind of a useful analytic

00:04:07.467 --> 00:04:12.167
and organizational structure
to use in your papers.

00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:17.533
So start out with one pair of
analytic terms and then try

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:21.200
out the various variations
of that term in the

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.800
course of the paper.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.400
And that will give you a
really tight structure.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.300
That's what Hemingway wants.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.333
So I'll explain this more, but
just keep this in your mind.

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:35.867
Think of your papers as theme
and variation, you inventing

00:04:35.867 --> 00:04:39.333
different terms that would
allow for that theme and

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:40.633
variation structure.

00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:43.900
So I'll talk more about
the substantive

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.467
implication of that.

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:47.667
But for now, I think that this
is really what Hemingway

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:49.600
himself is doing.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.900
Because he's such a great
writer, he's a

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.833
good example to us.

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:56.600
So anyway, today we'll
be looking at

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.033
four possible clusters.

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:00.900
I want to emphasize that.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.167
These are just conjectural
clusters.

00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:05.967
We can test them.

00:05:05.967 --> 00:05:12.200
The first one is chapter seven
and "Soldier's Home." And then

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.133
we'll be looking at chapter
nine and "Mr. and Mrs.

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:17.600
Elliot." Hilarious story.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.533
Chapter ten and "Cat in the
Rain." And then chapter twelve

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:25.767
and "Big Two-Hearted
River: Part II."

00:05:25.767 --> 00:05:29.467
So first chapter seven.

00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:32.333
Once again, we're back in
wartime Europe, the

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:35.033
experience of combat.

00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:38.533
"While the bombardment was
knocking the trench to pieces

00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:43.900
at Fossalta, he laid very flat
and sweated and prayed oh

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.867
Jesus Christ get
me our of here.

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:47.767
Dear Jesus please get me out.

00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:51.733
Jesus, please, please,
please, Christ...

00:05:51.733 --> 00:05:55.033
The shelling moved further
up the line.

00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:59.867
We went to work on the trench
and in the morning the sun

00:05:59.867 --> 00:06:03.267
came up and the day was
hot and muggy and

00:06:03.267 --> 00:06:05.900
cheerful and quiet.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.200
The next night back at Mestre
he did not tell the girl he

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.267
went upstairs with at the
Villa Rossa about Jesus.

00:06:14.267 --> 00:06:16.833
And he never told anybody."

00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:23.267
So this is the classic dynamics
of before and after,

00:06:23.267 --> 00:06:27.200
and intensity of the experience
when you're in the

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.400
thick of the battle, and the
sense that you really have

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.833
lost it all once that experience
is behind you.

00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:40.433
So what Hemingway is exploring
here, and that he would we'll

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:45.533
see here also explore at great
length in "Soldier's Home" is

00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:51.467
the intransitive relation
of emotions across time.

00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:53.233
It's a terrible thing.

00:06:53.233 --> 00:06:56.567
We think so much about the
question of sustainability.

00:06:56.567 --> 00:07:01.100
It's important for things to
be sustainable across time.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.633
It seems that Hemingway is
saying that, basically,

00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:07.733
intense emotions are not
sustainable across time.

00:07:07.733 --> 00:07:11.433
And we'll see this in a big way,
actually, in Faulkner in

00:07:11.433 --> 00:07:15.000
The Sound and the Fury in
the Quentin section.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.600
Even when we're devastated by
something, whether or not that

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.167
sense of devastation will be
with us, even a short moment

00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:24.300
afterwards.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.867
So it seems that when he is
fearing, in this kind of

00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:35.467
mortal fear, for his
life, Jesus.

00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:38.467
And that's really kind of
a name for something.

00:07:38.467 --> 00:07:39.967
It's not necessarily Jesus.

00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:42.400
Although in this case it
actually is Jesus.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.733
But Jesus could also be a
shorthand for something that

00:07:44.733 --> 00:07:47.567
we really want just to invoke.

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:50.567
And it's very much a presence
for us at that moment.

00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:53.733
And then the meaning of Jesus
is completely lost, even the

00:07:53.733 --> 00:07:54.933
next night.

00:07:54.933 --> 00:08:01.300
So what's interesting, and I
guess quite bleak about it, is

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.900
that we really can't hold on to
our own experience, right?

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.167
We'd like to think that if we've
been through this, that

00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:09.867
it's ours for good.

00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:11.333
It's ours for life.

00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:14.200
And it seems not
to be the case.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:21.867
So let's move on now to
"Soldier's Home" and we know--

00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:25.733
I'm just realizing the mic
is all the way down--

00:08:25.733 --> 00:08:29.567
we know that this Krebs was a
soldier fighting in basically

00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:35.733
all the famous battles in World
War I. And then he comes

00:08:35.733 --> 00:08:36.500
home too late.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.300
So by which time all the other
people have been back and

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.433
they've been telling stories
about war atrocities.

00:08:41.433 --> 00:08:45.600
So nobody's listening
to him anymore.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.167
And his mother is just worried
that he should find a job.

00:08:50.167 --> 00:08:56.467
So this is the very near the
middle, just one line near the

00:08:56.467 --> 00:08:57.167
middle of the story.

00:08:57.167 --> 00:09:00.400
They're having breakfast. Krebs
is reading the papers

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.000
and worrying about his father
not wanting the paper to be

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.167
roughed up.

00:09:06.167 --> 00:09:11.233
And then meanwhile, "Krebs
looked at the bacon fat

00:09:11.233 --> 00:09:14.533
hardening on his plate."

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:19.600
And I think that is in some
sense to most graphic metaphor

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.233
that Hemingway has come up with,
a material emblem of our

00:09:24.233 --> 00:09:26.533
own relation to our
own experience.

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:29.267
That this is the chemical
transformation.

00:09:29.267 --> 00:09:30.700
It's so natural.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.133
Last time we talked about the
naturalization of pain.

00:09:34.133 --> 00:09:36.333
Childbirth is as natural
as rain.

00:09:36.333 --> 00:09:40.100
And the pain that we inflict
on others is also

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.033
as natural as rain.

00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:48.700
And here, for fresh experience
to go stale, it is as natural

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:54.267
as the bacon becoming
stale on your plate.

00:09:54.267 --> 00:10:02.033
So that's just using a very
common object to talk about

00:10:02.033 --> 00:10:05.733
the fate of emotions
across time.

00:10:05.733 --> 00:10:12.233
And the fact that to go on
living is not cumulative.

00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:16.167
There's a loss until the
longer you live.

00:10:16.167 --> 00:10:17.400
I mean, this is a
terrible thing.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.733
We like to think that some
things can be cumulative but

00:10:21.733 --> 00:10:25.333
according to this paradigm, it's
almost as if the longer

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:30.167
you live, the more you
lose, actually.

00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:33.467
And we know that Hemingway
actually chose to end his own

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:34.133
life, right?

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:37.267
So this is almost a kind of--

00:10:37.267 --> 00:10:40.233
I mean he wasn't thinking about
suicide at that point,

00:10:40.233 --> 00:10:41.367
at this early point--

00:10:41.367 --> 00:10:45.067
but it's almost a justification
for suicide.

00:10:45.067 --> 00:10:48.000
That you want to end it at the
moment of its greatest

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.233
intensity and greatest emotional
satisfaction.

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:53.333
You don't want to lose that.

00:10:53.333 --> 00:10:59.533
So there's that, the bacon fat
hardening on his plate.

00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:04.967
And at the very end of the
story, "Well, that was all

00:11:04.967 --> 00:11:06.533
over now, anyway.

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:09.833
He would go over to the
schoolyard and watch Helen

00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:15.167
play indoor basketball."
No detail is trivial.

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:16.933
No detail is random--

00:11:16.933 --> 00:11:19.233
well, not always,
but quite often.

00:11:19.233 --> 00:11:22.633
This is a very significant
detail in Hemingway.

00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:30.900
And it's almost the kind of a
slightly larger view, moving

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.033
away from the bacon fat
on the plate to the

00:11:34.033 --> 00:11:37.367
larger family situation.

00:11:37.367 --> 00:11:42.767
Krebs was a very good soldier
during World War I. He's not a

00:11:42.767 --> 00:11:47.200
very efficient player in
civilian life, right?

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.933
Helen is the player.

00:11:48.933 --> 00:11:53.033
She's literally the
basketball player.

00:11:53.033 --> 00:11:55.100
But she's also a player
in a bigger sense.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.500
She's more consequential in life
than Krebs ever would be.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.700
And it's the sadness of being
consequential, being only

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.667
consequentially important, very
good at what you're doing

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:14.667
in one context and being
terrible, not attended to, and

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:18.767
not listened to, being
completely on the sidelines

00:12:18.767 --> 00:12:22.500
once you're put in a different
kind of situation.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:29.167
So Krebs is on the sidelines,
a mere spectator, as Helen

00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:33.033
plays both the indoor basketball
and also the game

00:12:33.033 --> 00:12:37.267
of life that he's probably not
going to be very good at.

00:12:37.267 --> 00:12:42.100
So obviously I think these two
stories, the connection

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.233
between them, very,
very tight.

00:12:44.233 --> 00:12:46.500
They are in two different
settings.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.767
But they really making exactly
the same point.

00:12:50.767 --> 00:12:57.433
So let's move on now to a more
interesting kind of, not quite

00:12:57.433 --> 00:13:01.833
so clear cut, between chapter
nine and "Mr. and Mrs.

00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:08.033
Elliot." So chapter nine is in
many ways the Hemingway that

00:13:08.033 --> 00:13:10.967
we're very familiar with, the
Hemingway in The Sun Also

00:13:10.967 --> 00:13:15.167
Rises, the Hemingway who talks
about bull fights.

00:13:15.167 --> 00:13:17.267
He also does it in the Death
in the Afternoon.

00:13:17.267 --> 00:13:22.833
So this is the kind of
classic Hemingway.

00:13:22.833 --> 00:13:25.000
Except there's a twist here.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.800
"The first matador got the horn
through his sword hand

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.267
and the crowd hooted him.

00:13:32.267 --> 00:13:35.667
The second matador slipped
and the bull caught

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:37.633
him through the belly.

00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:42.167
He hung on to the horn with one
hand and held the other

00:13:42.167 --> 00:13:45.733
tight against the place, and
the bull rammed him, wham,

00:13:45.733 --> 00:13:49.267
against the wall and the horn
came out, and he lay in the

00:13:49.267 --> 00:13:53.033
sand and then got up like crazy
drunk and tried to slug

00:13:53.033 --> 00:13:56.933
the men carrying him away,
and yelled for his

00:13:56.933 --> 00:13:59.200
sword but he fainted.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.800
The kid came out and had to kill
five bulls, because you

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.467
can't have more than
three matadors."

00:14:07.467 --> 00:14:10.867
This is the emotion, I think,
that is actually the dominant

00:14:10.867 --> 00:14:12.367
emotion in In Our Time.

00:14:12.367 --> 00:14:14.333
This isn't exactly tragedy.

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:18.200
It doesn't rise to the
level of tragedy.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.567
But it's not exactly
funny, either.

00:14:20.567 --> 00:14:25.233
And this is really the
combination of tragedy/comedy

00:14:25.233 --> 00:14:27.933
that is so important
to Hemingway.

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:31.767
Nobody gets killed except for
the bull, five of them.

00:14:31.767 --> 00:14:34.867
But that's supposed to happen.

00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:39.067
There are two completely
incompetent matadors.

00:14:39.067 --> 00:14:44.333
They're making a farce, really,
of the bull fight.

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:48.600
And meanwhile it's also farcical
in a different way

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.633
that you have to stick
by the rules.

00:14:50.633 --> 00:14:54.500
Even though the first two
matadors are making a complete

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.833
mess of everything, you still
have to go by the rules.

00:14:57.833 --> 00:14:59.800
So you can't have more
than three matadors.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.500
And so one single person has
to kill five bulls because

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.033
that's the rule.

00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:06.567
So this is the kind of a
combination we don't know

00:15:06.567 --> 00:15:09.800
whether to laugh or to cry.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.733
And I guess we laugh because
it's not worth crying over.

00:15:14.733 --> 00:15:16.300
But it really is
not that funny.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:22.767
And this is the nature of the
very complicated dark kind of

00:15:22.767 --> 00:15:26.467
comedy that we get in Hemingway,
and that we'll be

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:29.533
getting in Fitzgerald and
Faulkner as well.

00:15:29.533 --> 00:15:31.933
So this is really the
common ground.

00:15:31.933 --> 00:15:35.867
Very interesting compounding
of genres.

00:15:35.867 --> 00:15:40.933
Usually we're used to thinking
of tragedy and comedy as two

00:15:40.933 --> 00:15:43.567
discrete genres, quite
separate, right?

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:45.400
But in American literature--

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.367
this really goes back to the
nineteenth century--

00:15:48.367 --> 00:15:52.600
in American literature quite
often there's the mixing of

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:57.100
genres, with tragedy
being energized,

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.600
actually, by comedy.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.133
And producing a really
interesting kind of

00:16:02.133 --> 00:16:04.433
experimental genre.

00:16:04.433 --> 00:16:05.367
So OK.

00:16:05.367 --> 00:16:09.900
So keep that in mind it's
about bull fighting and

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.033
incompetent matadors.

00:16:12.033 --> 00:16:15.467
And then the kid having
to clean up the mess.

00:16:15.467 --> 00:16:19.233
So it would seem on the face of
it, it would seem that that

00:16:19.233 --> 00:16:22.733
really could not have any
relation to "Mr. and Mrs.

00:16:22.733 --> 00:16:25.733
Elliot," which has nothing
to do with bull fighting.

00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:28.733
It's about a poet, or someone
who's trying to be a poet, and

00:16:28.733 --> 00:16:30.767
his wife, and so forth.

00:16:30.767 --> 00:16:35.433
But this very interesting
history behind this story.

00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:40.467
And "Mr. and Mrs. Elliot," the
story, was first published in

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:41.433
The Little Review.

00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:44.933
Last time we talked about how
a lot of the pieces came out

00:16:44.933 --> 00:16:46.167
in little magazines, right?

00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:53.833
So this is The Little Review,
1924/1925 edition.

00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:59.067
And then it came out again,
in In Our Time, obviously,

00:16:59.067 --> 00:17:04.633
Deliver Right edition, the
American edition, 1925.

00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:07.200
And it turns out that Hemingway
actually has written

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:13.200
a very telling letter
to Horace Liveright.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.967
You can see it here.

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:19.633
Actually, I think that if you go
to ClassesV2 to look at the

00:17:19.633 --> 00:17:22.933
image online, you should be able
to zoom in and actually

00:17:22.933 --> 00:17:23.767
look at all the words.

00:17:23.767 --> 00:17:26.467
But anyway, this is the
transcript of one of the

00:17:26.467 --> 00:17:28.133
paragraphs.

00:17:28.133 --> 00:17:31.100
"As you will see I have revised
the Mr. and Mrs.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:37.800
Elliot story and entirely
eliminated the obscene image.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.633
It is a shame it had to be
changed, but as you say, it

00:17:42.633 --> 00:17:46.533
would be a very silly play to
get the entire first book

00:17:46.533 --> 00:17:49.533
suppressed for the sake
of the few funny

00:17:49.533 --> 00:17:52.433
cracks in one story...

00:17:52.433 --> 00:17:55.100
Jane Heap ran it in its original
form." This is The

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.033
Little Review--

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:58.167
editor of The Little Review.

00:17:58.167 --> 00:18:02.500
"Jane Heap ran it in the
original form and did not get

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.400
into any trouble." OK.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.800
So we're talking about a libel
suit it looks like.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.567
That legal action could be
visited upon Hemingway because

00:18:14.567 --> 00:18:15.300
of his story.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.700
So what could be the cause
for this legal

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.400
action against Hemingway?

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.600
The title of the story
is suggestive, right?

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.400
Elliot is a very important
name in both American

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.200
literature and British
literature.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.533
Very, very important name.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:39.400
This is T.S. Eliot, obviously.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.367
Known to Hemingway.

00:18:40.367 --> 00:18:45.767
They were in the same
circles, both in

00:18:45.767 --> 00:18:49.633
England and also in France.

00:18:49.633 --> 00:18:54.400
And T.S. Eliot was one of the
most important poets,

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.667
twentieth century poets, best
known for the poem "The

00:18:56.667 --> 00:19:01.500
Wasteland," would go on in 1948
to win the Nobel Prize.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.600
So major poet.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:13.800
And this is a picture of his
first wife, Vivienne.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:19.767
And Eliot on the far right and
Vivienne is on the far left.

00:19:19.767 --> 00:19:23.633
And it was a marriage that ended
in divorce, and with

00:19:23.633 --> 00:19:27.700
Vivienne having lots and lots of
mental problems. So it was

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:32.367
a kind of very public
dissolution of the marriage.

00:19:32.367 --> 00:19:37.067
Very painful, actually, when she
was clearly going crazy.

00:19:37.067 --> 00:19:42.233
So Hemingway's story isn't
really about that.

00:19:42.233 --> 00:19:46.467
But it's really making fun of
something that really didn't

00:19:46.467 --> 00:19:48.767
end up being all that funny.

00:19:48.767 --> 00:19:53.233
It was a kind of horrendous
episode in T.S. Eliot's life.

00:19:53.233 --> 00:19:57.400
But the way that Hemingway
is talking about it

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.300
initially is this.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.500
This is his version.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.133
And, as you will see, he's
actually changed

00:20:05.133 --> 00:20:06.300
the spelling, right?

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:11.933
T.S. Eliot just one "l." And so
just to remove the threat

00:20:11.933 --> 00:20:14.833
of legal action for himself,
he's changed

00:20:14.833 --> 00:20:17.767
the spelling of Elliot.

00:20:17.767 --> 00:20:21.933
And this is a story
that he tells.

00:20:21.933 --> 00:20:26.967
"Mrs. Elliot and the girl friend
now slept together in

00:20:26.967 --> 00:20:29.467
the big medieval bed.

00:20:29.467 --> 00:20:32.500
They had many a good
cry together.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.433
In the evening they all sat at
dinner together in the garden

00:20:36.433 --> 00:20:42.267
under a plane tree and the hot
evening wind blew and Elliot

00:20:42.267 --> 00:20:46.367
drank white wine and Mrs. Elliot
and the girl friend

00:20:46.367 --> 00:20:50.167
made conversation and they were
all quite happy." Once

00:20:50.167 --> 00:20:53.867
again, this is the
happy ending in

00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:56.967
quotation marks in Hemingway.

00:20:56.967 --> 00:21:04.967
But you can really see why T.S.
Eliot would contemplate

00:21:04.967 --> 00:21:09.000
legal action against Hemingway,
obviously.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.467
The suggestion of a lesbian
relationship, not really--

00:21:15.467 --> 00:21:18.433
there was nothing, actually, in
the actual life of Vivienne

00:21:18.433 --> 00:21:21.633
Eliot to suggest that there
was a lesbian relation.

00:21:21.633 --> 00:21:24.433
She did have an affair very soon
after she was married to

00:21:24.433 --> 00:21:28.433
T.S. Eliot, but with a man,
Bertrand Russell, actually a

00:21:28.433 --> 00:21:30.100
famous philosopher.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.933
So this is complete fabrication

00:21:33.933 --> 00:21:35.800
on the part of Hemingway.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.667
But, I think, that this
actually, possibly something

00:21:39.667 --> 00:21:42.333
else, that's mixed
into the story.

00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:46.500
It's the lesbian relationship
that stops this from being a

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.533
tragedy, right?

00:21:47.533 --> 00:21:51.100
It really would have been
quite tragic if the girl

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.200
friend had not been there.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:57.000
But it's really this three
triangular relation that

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.833
enables Mr. Elliot to drink
white wine and to spend all

00:22:00.833 --> 00:22:02.033
night writing poetry.

00:22:02.033 --> 00:22:04.733
He doesn't especially want
to be in the same

00:22:04.733 --> 00:22:06.700
room with his wife.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.667
And Mrs. Elliot and the girl
friend have many a good cry

00:22:10.667 --> 00:22:13.400
together in the big
medieval bed.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.733
And they were all quite happy.

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:20.100
So Hemingway is really, in one
sense, thinking of the

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.433
historic T.S. Eliot and
Vivienne Eliot.

00:22:23.433 --> 00:22:27.533
But I think that he was also
actually thinking of another

00:22:27.533 --> 00:22:31.433
couple, very good friends of
his at one point, that he

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:36.700
talks about at great length in
A Moveable Feast. Another

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.500
iconic figure in American
literature Gertrude Stein, and

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.900
her companion, lifelong
companion,

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.267
actually, Alice B. Toklas.

00:22:46.267 --> 00:22:52.433
That's Gertrude Stein on the
right and Alice on the left.

00:22:52.433 --> 00:22:57.233
And Hemingway also makes fun of
them in A Moveable Feast.

00:22:57.233 --> 00:23:02.433
But, actually, if you guys
have seen Woody Allen's

00:23:02.433 --> 00:23:03.700
Midnight in Paris--

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:10.233
if you haven't seen it,
try to see it on DVD.

00:23:10.233 --> 00:23:13.767
Gertrude Stein is very, very
important there as, really, a

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:16.800
mentor to Hemingway.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.833
I'm sorry, we thought
of showing this,

00:23:20.833 --> 00:23:21.833
but it's still running.

00:23:21.833 --> 00:23:24.733
So we don't have it
on DVD to show it.

00:23:24.733 --> 00:23:27.500
But in any case, if you see that
Woody Allen movie, you'll

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:32.133
see that Gertrude Stein was
crucial both to other young

00:23:32.133 --> 00:23:34.267
writers, but also
to Hemingway.

00:23:34.267 --> 00:23:38.467
And so a very long lasting--

00:23:38.467 --> 00:23:40.567
this was actually a sustainable
relationship, the

00:23:40.567 --> 00:23:42.567
lesbian relationship.

00:23:42.567 --> 00:23:44.300
For life, really.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:49.300
And happy as much as any
relationship can be happy.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.833
Those two were very,
very happy.

00:23:50.833 --> 00:23:55.900
So I think that what Hemingway
has done, actually, to produce

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:04.767
this tragedy/comedy is to
compound the very unhappy T.S.

00:24:04.767 --> 00:24:10.567
Eliot marriage to Vivienne
with much happier

00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:14.700
companionship between Gertrude
Stein and Alice B. Toklas.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.700
And he really wasn't thinking of
libel from Gertrude Stein,

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.833
she is not mentioned by name.

00:24:21.833 --> 00:24:25.267
But she could not not have
been on his mind.

00:24:25.267 --> 00:24:28.367
So it's just a really
interesting kind of a capsule

00:24:28.367 --> 00:24:33.533
summary, actually, of a lot of
American literature in there.

00:24:33.533 --> 00:24:37.633
So I think that that's
really the connection

00:24:37.633 --> 00:24:40.433
with chapter nine.

00:24:40.433 --> 00:24:41.867
Not so much the subject
matter.

00:24:41.867 --> 00:24:44.833
There's no bull fighting
in the story.

00:24:44.833 --> 00:24:51.700
But the tragedy narrowly averted
turning into a comedy

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:56.700
or a farce, halfway between
comedy and farce.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.500
That is the ultimate outcome
of that kind of unusual

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.000
arrangement.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.600
But still doesn't rise to
the level of tragedy.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.767
And that's the most important
point for Hemingway.

00:25:11.767 --> 00:25:19.133
So let's move on now to
the next cluster.

00:25:19.133 --> 00:25:23.667
And I should stop here for a
moment and talk a little bit

00:25:23.667 --> 00:25:29.100
about the analytic structure
that we'll be using for the

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:35.233
next set of stories
and chapters.

00:25:35.233 --> 00:25:38.233
But actually beginning with
chapter nine and "Mr. and Mrs.

00:25:38.233 --> 00:25:42.500
Elliot," we are beginning to
see a kind of logic of

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.033
substitution.

00:25:44.033 --> 00:25:49.900
So Gertrude Stein and Alice B.
Toklas' relationship taking

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.233
the place--

00:25:51.233 --> 00:25:54.600
this relatively happy
relationship--

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.967
taking the place of the unhappy
historical relation

00:25:59.967 --> 00:26:04.067
between Vivienne and T.S. Eliot,
so that Hemingway can

00:26:04.067 --> 00:26:07.133
get to a place where
he wants to be.

00:26:07.133 --> 00:26:13.467
And so taking the place,
substitution, is a good thing

00:26:13.467 --> 00:26:18.733
in that chapter and
in that story.

00:26:18.733 --> 00:26:23.133
We'll explore the meaning
of substitution

00:26:23.133 --> 00:26:25.433
in the other clusters.

00:26:25.433 --> 00:26:26.300
Sometimes it's good.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.967
Sometimes it's not so good.

00:26:27.967 --> 00:26:31.467
It's always kind of a mixture.

00:26:31.467 --> 00:26:39.167
But on the whole, I would say
that Hemingway is much more

00:26:39.167 --> 00:26:42.533
interested in comedy
than tragedy.

00:26:42.533 --> 00:26:46.600
And here I'm going against
Aristotle and, in fact, a

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.367
whole tradition of Western
thinking about genres.

00:26:50.367 --> 00:26:53.767
Tragedy is the high,
dignified--

00:26:53.767 --> 00:26:54.500
very dignified--

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.967
genre, Greek tragedy.

00:26:56.967 --> 00:26:58.933
And that's what really
Aristotle talks

00:26:58.933 --> 00:27:00.433
about in the Poetics.

00:27:00.433 --> 00:27:02.967
His attention is really
all given to tragedy.

00:27:02.967 --> 00:27:06.233
Comedy gets about two lines
in the Poetics.

00:27:06.233 --> 00:27:10.967
So I think that tragedy just
has a different kind of

00:27:10.967 --> 00:27:15.733
centrality to the entire
Western canon.

00:27:15.733 --> 00:27:20.067
But comedy, arguably, is
actually just as interesting

00:27:20.067 --> 00:27:21.567
and just as complex.

00:27:21.567 --> 00:27:25.733
So in the rest of the course,
we'll be thinking about the

00:27:25.733 --> 00:27:31.067
ways in which comedy actually is
right next door to tragedy.

00:27:31.067 --> 00:27:33.900
We have to rethink
the landscape.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.100
Rather than thinking of these
two as being on opposite ends

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.733
of the spectrum, to think
about almost a kind of

00:27:41.733 --> 00:27:46.600
emotional proximity between
tragedy and comedy.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.100
Not because this is a natural
proximity, but because the

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.667
writers that we're looking at
they tend to have that really

00:27:53.667 --> 00:27:58.433
kind of interesting thinking
and mixing of genres.

00:27:58.433 --> 00:28:04.233
So in the next cluster, chapter
ten and "Cat in the

00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:09.033
Rain," we'll first of all,
look at one kind of

00:28:09.033 --> 00:28:13.000
substitution taking place
in chapter ten, the

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.567
horse and the picador.

00:28:15.567 --> 00:28:19.400
And then the cat in the
"Cat in the Rain."

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.633
I should mention that there's
a difference between the

00:28:22.633 --> 00:28:25.567
picador and the matador.

00:28:25.567 --> 00:28:29.100
This is a distinction I didn't
know about it before I started

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.267
reading about Hemingway.

00:28:31.267 --> 00:28:38.400
Is that the matador is the one
who actually kills the bull.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.267
The picador's function is
to weaken the bull.

00:28:42.267 --> 00:28:44.067
The picador never actually
kills the bull.

00:28:44.067 --> 00:28:47.167
So it's always kind of the
three step ceremony.

00:28:47.167 --> 00:28:49.600
The bull by the time he comes
out, the bull is weakened

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.533
already by various people
sticking knives into him.

00:28:53.533 --> 00:28:58.100
And the picador tries to do a
major job of weakening the

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.000
bull, and then the matador
comes out and

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.200
actually kills the bull.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.933
And the picador doesn't actually
come out on foot.

00:29:06.933 --> 00:29:10.433
He's always on a horse.

00:29:10.433 --> 00:29:16.167
And this we find out how
Hemingway feels about that

00:29:16.167 --> 00:29:19.933
practice, about a picador coming
out on a horse and

00:29:19.933 --> 00:29:22.133
fighting the bull.

00:29:22.133 --> 00:29:26.100
"They whack-whacked the white
horse on the legs and he kneed

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.900
himself up.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.700
The picador twisted the stirrups
straight and pulled

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.600
and hauled up into the saddle.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:40.900
The horse's entrails hung down
in a blue bunch and swung

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:45.700
backward and forward as he began
to canter, the monos

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:50.900
whacking him on the back of
his legs with the rods."

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.167
It's a terrible thing.

00:29:51.167 --> 00:29:56.500
Actually, this has been banned
in many Spanish cities because

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.700
it's just so incredibly cruel.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:05.733
And here are two images of that
kind of substitution,

00:30:05.733 --> 00:30:12.033
shameless use of the horse as
a shield against the bull.

00:30:12.033 --> 00:30:17.800
And we can see the expressions,

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.767
they're used to it.

00:30:18.767 --> 00:30:19.833
This is done all the time.

00:30:19.833 --> 00:30:23.733
This is not exceptional
cowardice on

00:30:23.733 --> 00:30:25.467
the part of the picador.

00:30:25.467 --> 00:30:28.967
That's part of the game.

00:30:28.967 --> 00:30:31.633
But still it's very
hard to take when

00:30:31.633 --> 00:30:32.667
you're looking at it.

00:30:32.667 --> 00:30:36.133
And to see the entrails actually
coming up right at

00:30:36.133 --> 00:30:37.667
that moment.

00:30:37.667 --> 00:30:39.533
And here's another image.

00:30:39.533 --> 00:30:41.100
There are just countless
images.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:45.167
All you have to do is to type in
"Picador's Horse" on Google

00:30:45.167 --> 00:30:47.833
and you'll find all
these images.

00:30:47.833 --> 00:30:54.033
So Hemingway, even though he's
a big aficionado of the

00:30:54.033 --> 00:30:57.800
matador coming out-- and we'll
see his celebration of this

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:03.433
one-on-one battle between the
matador and the horse--

00:31:03.433 --> 00:31:06.600
just finds this practice
utterly despicable.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.567
I mean, this is really
substitution at its worst. And

00:31:10.567 --> 00:31:13.467
so he's talking about this--

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.800
it's hard to wrap our minds
around this completely

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.033
ritualized practice.

00:31:24.033 --> 00:31:28.533
And so that's what he talks
about in chapter ten.

00:31:28.533 --> 00:31:31.667
And then in "Cat in the Rain,"
once again there's no thematic

00:31:31.667 --> 00:31:37.200
continuity between chapter ten
and "Cat in the Rain," about a

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.267
young American couple
in a hotel.

00:31:39.267 --> 00:31:44.033
Completely non-violent
setting.

00:31:44.033 --> 00:31:46.333
And doesn't seem very
dramatic either.

00:31:46.333 --> 00:31:50.000
In some sense, it seems as if
nothing happens in that story.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
But there is a kind of
interesting way in which we

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:04.133
can read that story as a story
about substitution as well, in

00:32:04.133 --> 00:32:08.000
the sense that the young
wife does have one

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.133
very emphatic desire.

00:32:11.133 --> 00:32:14.667
"'Anyway, I want a cat,' she
said. 'I want a cat.

00:32:14.667 --> 00:32:16.633
I want a cat now.

00:32:16.633 --> 00:32:21.433
If I can't have long hair or any
fun, I can have a cat.'"

00:32:21.433 --> 00:32:27.100
So the cat, obviously,
is shorthand for

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:27.933
something else, right?

00:32:27.933 --> 00:32:33.667
She's actually looking at this
kitty in the rain, not trying

00:32:33.667 --> 00:32:36.567
to hide from the rain
under the table, and

00:32:36.567 --> 00:32:39.467
thinking of the cat.

00:32:39.467 --> 00:32:43.467
And she says, OK, you know, if
I can't have anything else, I

00:32:43.467 --> 00:32:47.400
can't have my own silver at
a table, I can't have new

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.833
clothes, I want a cat.

00:32:50.833 --> 00:32:55.400
But even those things, eating at
a table with my own silver,

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.433
even that is probably
just a metaphor for

00:32:58.433 --> 00:33:01.433
something else as well.

00:33:01.433 --> 00:33:05.367
And so the wanting a cat, the
fact that it's such an

00:33:05.367 --> 00:33:09.667
artificial and unpersuasive
substitution for something

00:33:09.667 --> 00:33:14.233
that she doesn't have in her
life, suggests that there is

00:33:14.233 --> 00:33:21.933
something, that this very
peaceful story does have

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:26.867
something in common with a
very violent episode in

00:33:26.867 --> 00:33:30.033
chapter nine.

00:33:30.033 --> 00:33:38.833
It really has to do with the
way we think about what is

00:33:38.833 --> 00:33:44.233
adequate to what we could call a
good life or a good marriage

00:33:44.233 --> 00:33:46.167
or a good anything.

00:33:46.167 --> 00:33:48.567
Hemingway isn't really thinking,
especially this

00:33:48.567 --> 00:33:51.533
story is about what constitutes
a good marriage,

00:33:51.533 --> 00:33:56.000
or what is absent that would
make for a bad marriage.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.700
But it really is thinking,
generally and abstractly,

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:07.067
about what counts as a good life
or what counts as being a

00:34:07.067 --> 00:34:10.733
good player in a bullfight.

00:34:10.733 --> 00:34:13.200
And coming out and using your
horse as a shield, that

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:18.067
doesn't count as merit
for Hemingway.

00:34:18.067 --> 00:34:24.400
So in this case,
it's the wife.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.867
We think about the
configuration.

00:34:26.867 --> 00:34:31.333
She goes out in the rain, an
umbrella opens up behind her,

00:34:31.333 --> 00:34:34.100
and it's a hotel maid
that opens up the

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.867
umbrella behind her.

00:34:36.867 --> 00:34:38.767
She says, "I want a cat.

00:34:38.767 --> 00:34:45.033
I want a cat." And, in fact,
I'll just read you the ending

00:34:45.033 --> 00:34:46.300
of that story.

00:34:48.967 --> 00:34:51.100
"Someone knocked"--
on page 94--

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.600
"Someone knocked at her door.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.233
'Avante,' George said.

00:34:54.233 --> 00:34:56.433
He looked up from his book.

00:34:56.433 --> 00:34:58.633
In the doorway stood the maid.

00:34:58.633 --> 00:35:02.867
She held a big tortoiseshell cat
pressed tight against her

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:05.433
and swung down against
her body.

00:35:05.433 --> 00:35:07.333
'Excuse me,' she said.

00:35:07.333 --> 00:35:11.800
'The padrone asked me to bring
this for the senora.'"

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.500
First of all, it's a very sly
substitution going on.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.667
Because I don't think it's
actually the same cat.

00:35:17.667 --> 00:35:22.433
This big tortoiseshell cat
probably isn't the same kitty

00:35:22.433 --> 00:35:24.400
that she saw earlier
in the story.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.200
So there is one almost
comical kind of a

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.800
substitution going on.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.433
But the more important
substitution in the story,

00:35:33.433 --> 00:35:37.467
other than just wanting the
cat to stand for something

00:35:37.467 --> 00:35:44.633
else, is also that instead
of the husband being the

00:35:44.633 --> 00:35:49.300
emotional support for the
wife, it is the hotel

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.433
apparatus that has substituted,
has stepped in

00:35:53.433 --> 00:35:55.533
and is fulfilling
that function.

00:35:55.533 --> 00:35:58.700
The hotel maid is the one who
opens the umbrella when the

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.167
wife steps out into the rain.

00:36:01.167 --> 00:36:02.533
She wants a cat.

00:36:02.533 --> 00:36:06.367
It's the hotel staff that
brings the cat.

00:36:06.367 --> 00:36:14.633
So this is, for me, this is
one of the best and most

00:36:14.633 --> 00:36:21.667
memorable portraits of what's
missing in a marriage that is

00:36:21.667 --> 00:36:24.833
just done in a couple
of pages.

00:36:24.833 --> 00:36:30.400
And done completely through
third parties, right?

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.967
So this is a story supposedly
about husband and wife and is

00:36:34.967 --> 00:36:37.533
almost told completely through
third parties, through the

00:36:37.533 --> 00:36:41.333
cat, through the hotel maid,
through the padrone.

00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:46.967
And so it says something about
Hemingway's strategy as well.

00:36:46.967 --> 00:36:51.533
And this is really something to
think about for all of the

00:36:51.533 --> 00:36:55.267
writers, is how to frame
the story and how to

00:36:55.267 --> 00:36:57.500
populate the story.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:03.333
And the population of what is in
the foreground in the story

00:37:03.333 --> 00:37:06.867
isn't necessarily the center.

00:37:06.867 --> 00:37:09.833
I mean the house maid is front
and center in this story.

00:37:09.833 --> 00:37:13.667
This story isn't really about
the hotel maid, but

00:37:13.667 --> 00:37:16.900
nonetheless she is in the
foreground, as is the cat.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.467
So what is this story about?

00:37:20.467 --> 00:37:22.300
This is a good question
to ask.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:26.100
Actually, this is another
question that is related to

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.700
writing papers.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.167
Start out by thinking
what is this

00:37:30.167 --> 00:37:32.200
particular paragraph about?

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.133
I mean, certain things are in
the foreground, but it could

00:37:35.133 --> 00:37:38.767
be there's something much more
marginal could actually be the

00:37:38.767 --> 00:37:40.400
real subject of that
paragraph.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.100
So it's always a good analytic
strategy to--

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:52.200
um, gosh, never thought--

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:52.833
is it mine?

00:37:52.833 --> 00:37:53.467
It's not mine, right?

00:37:53.467 --> 00:37:54.633
[Referring to the ringing
of a cell phone.]

00:37:54.633 --> 00:37:55.367
Yeah.

00:37:55.367 --> 00:37:57.533
For some reason I
just thought--

00:37:57.533 --> 00:37:58.467
Good.

00:37:58.467 --> 00:38:02.300
That would be really a
big embarrassment.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:10.800
But, in any case, so here's
a little act of

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.800
substitution, whatever.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:21.133
But so far we've been talking
about the clustering of the

00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:23.267
stories in the chapters.

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:26.600
Really, kind of going in a
bleak direction, right?

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:31.300
You know it's not the lack of
emotional satisfaction seems

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.433
to be the main point in
all of these stories.

00:38:34.433 --> 00:38:42.833
That's really the kind of the
tragedy/comedy is the lack of

00:38:42.833 --> 00:38:44.933
adequate emotional resolution.

00:38:44.933 --> 00:38:49.233
There's just no emotional
resolution at the end of the

00:38:49.233 --> 00:38:52.200
"Cat in the Rain." There's no
emotional resolution at the

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.067
end of "Soldier's Home." There's
maybe a little bit of

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:58.267
emotional resolution at the end
of "Mr. and Mrs. Elliot,"

00:38:58.267 --> 00:39:02.233
but really not that great.

00:39:02.233 --> 00:39:10.200
So the question is, is this
kind of a natural resting

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.200
place for Hemingway?

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:18.333
Is that the kind of emotional
landscape that he feels most

00:39:18.333 --> 00:39:19.200
comfortable with?

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.533
And that would be
completely OK.

00:39:21.533 --> 00:39:25.533
I think that this is a viable
way of writing.

00:39:25.533 --> 00:39:28.500
And you can have great
literature resting on

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:33.433
precisely that very precarious
state of lack of emotional,

00:39:33.433 --> 00:39:37.033
lack of full satisfaction,
lack of full resolution.

00:39:37.033 --> 00:39:39.500
But I think that Hemingway,
actually, is a slightly

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.133
different kind of writer.

00:39:41.133 --> 00:39:52.433
So he is quite unashamed of
going to a sometimes almost

00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:55.000
embarrassing extreme in a sense
that you don't want to

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.600
show that this is really
what you believe in.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.900
So it's embarrassing
in this sense.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:04.533
But he's not especially
embarrassed about making it

00:40:04.533 --> 00:40:09.800
very clear what he believes in
and what he finds satisfying.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:15.133
I think that's really what makes
Hemingway what he is.

00:40:15.133 --> 00:40:20.000
In many ways, very emphatic
about belief and about

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.367
emotional space that he would
affirm and celebrate.

00:40:24.367 --> 00:40:28.200
So let's look at
chapter twelve.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:34.200
This is the combination that
shows that side of Hemingway.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:38.467
And it's not surprising, it's
back to bull fighting.

00:40:38.467 --> 00:40:41.967
But this time it's not the
picador on his horse.

00:40:41.967 --> 00:40:46.667
"When he started to kill it
was all in the same rush.

00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:51.333
The bull looking at him straight
in front, hating...

00:40:51.333 --> 00:40:54.867
The bull charged and
Villalta charged.

00:40:54.867 --> 00:40:58.800
And just for a moment
they became one.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.133
Villalta became one with the
bull and then it was over.

00:41:03.133 --> 00:41:07.033
Villalta standing straight and
the red hilt of the sword

00:41:07.033 --> 00:41:11.200
sticking out dully between
the bull's shoulders.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.100
Villalta, his hand up at the
crowd, and the bull roaring

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:22.833
blood, looking straight at
Villalta and his legs caving."

00:41:22.833 --> 00:41:25.467
So some of us would
find it gory.

00:41:25.467 --> 00:41:28.167
I don't think that I would
be singing the

00:41:28.167 --> 00:41:30.333
praises of bull fighting.

00:41:30.333 --> 00:41:35.400
But just to think in terms of
what Hemingway is doing, for

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:44.133
him this is the truly sublime
and satisfying moment for both

00:41:44.133 --> 00:41:47.167
the matador and for the bull.

00:41:47.167 --> 00:41:52.067
Because the repeated line is
that they became one, right?

00:41:52.067 --> 00:41:54.367
So they became one.

00:41:54.367 --> 00:41:58.667
That is the supreme ideal
for Hemingway.

00:41:58.667 --> 00:42:05.567
Instead of having this shield
of the horse shielding you

00:42:05.567 --> 00:42:09.400
from the bull, you are in direct
contact with the bull.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:16.033
And whatever you do, you do it
in utter lack of distance.

00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:19.167
So this is the kind of
the close up, the

00:42:19.167 --> 00:42:21.967
diminishment of distance.

00:42:21.967 --> 00:42:26.467
And the two of them really
bonding so tightly that it

00:42:26.467 --> 00:42:30.067
really becomes a kind
of a single unit.

00:42:30.067 --> 00:42:31.500
And that this could
be a metaphor

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.600
for any kind of thing.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.767
It can be a man and a bull, it
could be a man and a woman, it

00:42:34.767 --> 00:42:38.200
can be two women, it can be you
and a project you become

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.733
fused with.

00:42:39.733 --> 00:42:45.633
But for Hemingway, this kind of
complete lack of emotional

00:42:45.633 --> 00:42:50.367
insulation, we've talked about
the question of insulation in

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:55.400
Indian camp, but the complete
lack of emotional insulation

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.567
between yourself, that it's
something that you feel

00:42:57.567 --> 00:43:03.133
utterly passionate about: that
for Hemingway, is the place

00:43:03.133 --> 00:43:05.033
that he really wants
to get to.

00:43:05.033 --> 00:43:08.533
And all those times when he
doesn't get there, you can see

00:43:08.533 --> 00:43:12.133
why it's a kind of frustrating
resting place.

00:43:12.133 --> 00:43:14.567
And he wants us to be frustrated
when we can't get

00:43:14.567 --> 00:43:16.567
beyond those places.

00:43:16.567 --> 00:43:25.400
So this is kind of the classic
Hemingway epiphany of

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:29.667
achieving this union
with the bull that

00:43:29.667 --> 00:43:30.600
you're going to kill.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:34.700
And the fact you're going to
kill this creature, according

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.733
to him, doesn't really matter
because you've achieved that

00:43:37.733 --> 00:43:41.133
union at that critical moment.

00:43:41.133 --> 00:43:43.433
So this is--

00:43:43.433 --> 00:43:46.667
we are not reading The Sun Also
Rises, but this is almost

00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:52.900
a completely parallel moment
in The Sun Also Rises.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.100
Pedro Romero killing the bull.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.233
"The bull charged as
Romero charged.

00:44:01.233 --> 00:44:05.767
Romero's left hand dropped the
mulata over the bull's muzzle

00:44:05.767 --> 00:44:09.400
to blind him, his left shoulder
went forward between

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:15.067
the horns and the sword went in,
and for just an instant he

00:44:15.067 --> 00:44:16.733
and the bull were one..."

00:44:16.733 --> 00:44:21.933
So you can see that that word
one is of critical importance

00:44:21.933 --> 00:44:23.433
to Hemingway.

00:44:23.433 --> 00:44:27.900
Two entities becoming one.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:31.800
Even though, at the moment of
death and killing, is still

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.233
important to achieve that
oneness with the world.

00:44:36.233 --> 00:44:41.633
So I'm sure it's romanticizing
bull fighting, but it's

00:44:41.633 --> 00:44:44.533
actually one of the rare public

00:44:44.533 --> 00:44:47.433
demonstrations of that
happening.

00:44:47.433 --> 00:44:49.833
Actually, it's very hard
if we think about this.

00:44:49.833 --> 00:44:54.667
It's very hard to see two things
becoming one in public,

00:44:54.667 --> 00:44:59.933
so bull fighting is actually one
of the rare instances when

00:44:59.933 --> 00:45:02.667
everyone can be there
and watch.

00:45:02.667 --> 00:45:07.833
So Hemingway probably was
looking at something like this

00:45:07.833 --> 00:45:12.567
and it's really more like a
dance than actually the

00:45:12.567 --> 00:45:13.767
killing of the bull.

00:45:13.767 --> 00:45:16.133
You can see why he would
want to romanticize

00:45:16.133 --> 00:45:16.933
something like that.

00:45:16.933 --> 00:45:21.700
It's really completely
choreographed in such a way so

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:27.033
that the violence becomes
completely ritualized and we

00:45:27.033 --> 00:45:28.767
almost don't see the blood.

00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:32.667
There's no blood
in this moment.

00:45:32.667 --> 00:45:37.700
So anyway, so for Hemingway,
a completely unembarrassed

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:43.100
desire to get to this state,
he and the bull were one.

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.233
So let's move on now.

00:45:45.233 --> 00:45:48.167
And I have to say I actually
like the "Big Two-Hearted

00:45:48.167 --> 00:45:53.033
River" much more than the bull
fighting scenes in Hemingway.

00:45:53.033 --> 00:45:55.333
This is a great story.

00:45:55.333 --> 00:45:58.667
In many ways a rewrite
two-part story.

00:45:58.667 --> 00:46:01.367
A rewrite of Krebs coming
home, right?

00:46:01.367 --> 00:46:04.433
So this is also a
soldier's home.

00:46:04.433 --> 00:46:07.167
He's not among his family.

00:46:07.167 --> 00:46:14.267
But he is on this trip through
a country that is not really

00:46:14.267 --> 00:46:15.667
disclosed to us.

00:46:15.667 --> 00:46:18.533
A landscape we don't really
know where it is.

00:46:18.533 --> 00:46:21.033
We don't know where he's going
or why he's on that trip.

00:46:21.033 --> 00:46:24.467
But it's a fishing trip.

00:46:24.467 --> 00:46:34.200
And this is what happens at the
moment when Nick catches--

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.800
Nick, this is the same Nick
that we see grown up.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.000
The young Nick in "Indian Camp"
and "The Doctor's and

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.733
Doctor's Wife." Now he's a full
grown man and obviously

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:45.033
having been in war.

00:46:45.033 --> 00:46:50.633
But coming back and going
through what appears to be a

00:46:50.633 --> 00:46:53.200
healing process for
Hemingway, right?

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:57.633
So "Soldier's Home" is about
a non-healing of Krebs.

00:46:57.633 --> 00:46:59.867
The trauma of war and
the trauma of

00:46:59.867 --> 00:47:00.900
being completely marginal.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.567
And being sidelined.

00:47:02.567 --> 00:47:07.467
All of those things would
just keep hurting him.

00:47:07.467 --> 00:47:11.700
In the case of "Big Two-Hearted
River," it's a

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:15.433
rewrite of that and it's a very
different outcome coming

00:47:15.433 --> 00:47:17.833
out from that story.

00:47:17.833 --> 00:47:20.967
And it has to do actually
with similar

00:47:20.967 --> 00:47:24.200
dynamics to the bull fighting.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.667
"Nick cleaned them, slitting
the trout.

00:47:27.667 --> 00:47:31.900
Nick cleaned them, slitting them
from the vent to the tip

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:32.967
of the jaw.

00:47:32.967 --> 00:47:36.533
All the insides and the
gills and the tongue

00:47:36.533 --> 00:47:39.567
came out in one piece.

00:47:39.567 --> 00:47:43.333
They were both males; long
gray-white strips of milt,

00:47:43.333 --> 00:47:45.267
smooth and clean.

00:47:45.267 --> 00:47:49.767
All the insides clean and
compact, coming out all

00:47:49.767 --> 00:47:51.033
together."

00:47:51.033 --> 00:47:57.633
So this is just as emotionally
satisfying as the

00:47:57.633 --> 00:47:58.133
bullfighting.

00:47:58.133 --> 00:48:01.433
Not in the sense that we don't
have to choreograph a moment

00:48:01.433 --> 00:48:05.767
quite as dramatic and beautiful
as in the bullfight.

00:48:05.767 --> 00:48:13.800
But to be able to expand the
ritual of dying in one piece

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.900
to the trout.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:20.300
We do have to kill the trout
unless we're going to go

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.133
without any kind of
animal protein.

00:48:24.133 --> 00:48:35.533
So the trout is being killed,
but the way, the manner of

00:48:35.533 --> 00:48:37.233
killing is everything.

00:48:37.233 --> 00:48:41.333
That there should be no
degradation in death.

00:48:41.333 --> 00:48:46.867
That actually the measure of
a good life is first your

00:48:46.867 --> 00:48:51.700
ability to offer a good
death to someone else.

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.733
We do this all the time.

00:48:54.733 --> 00:48:57.733
It makes all the difference in
the world whether we kill

00:48:57.733 --> 00:49:02.233
brutally or whether we kill
ceremoniously with full

00:49:02.233 --> 00:49:04.700
respect for what we kill.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.967
And it also makes all the
difference in the world if you

00:49:08.967 --> 00:49:10.833
die a good death.

00:49:10.833 --> 00:49:13.733
There's really no other
conclusion.

00:49:13.733 --> 00:49:22.700
So it has to be completely
clean and satisfying.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:27.833
Both to the creature who is
going through it and to the

00:49:27.833 --> 00:49:30.767
person who is performing
that operation.

00:49:30.767 --> 00:49:35.333
So this actually, as far as I
can see, Hemingway is actually

00:49:35.333 --> 00:49:41.567
a very affirmative writer at
the end of In Our Time in a

00:49:41.567 --> 00:49:44.633
sense that he's also revising
his own story.

00:49:44.633 --> 00:49:49.100
He doesn't get to where he wants
to be in Krebs story in

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:51.167
"Soldier's Home," he comes
back and tells the

00:49:51.167 --> 00:49:52.600
story one more time.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.833
And this time he gets to
where he wants to be.

00:49:55.833 --> 00:50:00.700
So, say goodbye to Hemingway,
now we move on to Fitzgerald

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.133
and The Great Gatsby
on Tuesday.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.860
Prof: So good morning.
 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.910
Well today we have a fun topic:
suicide.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.460
Actually I didn't realize how
much interest there is amongst

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.530
students in suicide.
 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.702
Once we invited a professor
from Australia,

00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:24.569
who wanted to teach a course on
death and suicide,

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:30.430
and I was very concerned that
no students will take it;

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.759
and the class was full.
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.860
So it looks like suicide is a
popular topic.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.220
And I think I know why.
 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.510
Because when I was your age,
occasionally it occurred to my

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.804
mind, what if I commit suicide?
 

00:00:47.804 --> 00:00:48.470
Right?
 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.599
So I think thinking about
suicide is probably something

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:55.200
what crossed many of yours mind.
 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.326
And therefore hopefully
Durkheim will be exciting for

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:05.846
you, and will help you to
understand why did you consider

00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:08.704
it and why you did not do it?
 

00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:09.790
Right?
 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.140
Or why your friends or
acquaintances thought about it.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.709
Some of them may have tried;
some may have killed themselves.

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:25.230
Anyway, so this is about
Suicide.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.150
And as I said already before,
this is a path-breaking book,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.940
in many ways.
 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.486
It's really the first rigorous
empirical study of a social

00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:42.961
phenomenon--
and a very curious social

00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:46.117
phenomenon,
and we will talk about this as

00:01:46.117 --> 00:01:47.560
the lecture unfolds.
 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.717
Because we tend to think about
suicide as something very

00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:56.000
personal--right?--and
individual.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.927
And all right,
if a psychologist is interested

00:01:58.927 --> 00:02:01.140
in suicide, it's understandable.
 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.010
But why on earth a sociologist
would be interested in suicide?

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.092
It is so rare,
socially, fortunately--I mean,

00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:16.021
not in some societies,
but in most,

00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:17.639
very rare.
 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:22.375
And it looks like it's so much
a question of individual

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.340
decision.
 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.699
So why should a social
scientist try to explain it?

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:33.751
So Durkheim sets for himself a
very difficult task,

00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:36.580
and he does it formidably.
 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.133
I will show you that he does
some spectacular methodological

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.690
innovations.
 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.997
He kind of offers
methodological insights,

00:02:48.997 --> 00:02:53.199
what social scientists are
excited about,

00:02:53.199 --> 00:03:00.030
even today, well over a century
after he published this book.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.538
Okay, so that's about
Suicide.

00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:06.549
And first of all,
I will ask a few general

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.430
questions.
 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.710
And first of all,
the question is what is

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.780
suicide?
 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.818
When do we decide that a death
is suicide?

00:03:17.818 --> 00:03:23.318
And then also I would like to
pose the question,

00:03:23.318 --> 00:03:29.990
what are the reasons for social
scientists to study it?

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.598
And Durkheim gives some very
good reasons.

00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:36.276
And finally,
I will introduce Durkheim's

00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:38.348
typology of suicide.
 

00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:42.952
Many Durkheim scholars were
struggling with this,

00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:46.500
how to make sense of this
typology?

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.590
And I will show you one way how
to do it.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.765
Sort of there are--his major
types are egoistic,

00:03:56.765 --> 00:04:01.282
altruistic, anomic and
fatalistic suicide,

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:06.460
and I will talk about each of
them in turn.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.939
Okay, so let me start with the
definition.

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.310
And this is tricky, by the way.
 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.052
Also it's extremely tricky,
when it comes to statistics,

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:27.550
to figure out what statistics
do report as suicide.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.613
When people die,
especially if they do not leave

00:04:32.613 --> 00:04:36.851
a letter behind,
it's very hard to decide

00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:42.329
whether that person actually
committed suicide or it was just

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:43.699
an accident.
 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:49.127
Well there are occasions when
this is quite obvious.

00:04:49.127 --> 00:04:49.980
Right?
 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.310
Somebody's hanging himself,
or herself,--

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.620
which is a favorite way of
committing suicide,

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.430
of a certain type of people,
in certain instances,

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.095
right?--and the way how
somebody hanged himself makes it

00:05:05.095 --> 00:05:08.149
quite clear that it was a
suicide.

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:12.437
But doctors investigating the
cause of death very often are

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:15.470
puzzled whether this is suicide
or not.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.040
So you clearly have an overdose
of sleeping pills;

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.420
it's unclear whether it was an
accident, accidentally you took

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.891
more pills that you should have,
or whether this was actually a

00:05:30.891 --> 00:05:31.949
suicide.
 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:38.769
So there is a lot of problem in
studying statistical data about

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:43.509
suicide,
and very often doctors do make

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:49.865
judgments on the social
circumstances of the person who

00:05:49.865 --> 00:05:51.983
committed suicide.
 

00:05:51.983 --> 00:05:53.160
Right?
 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.232
They read Durkheim,
or they have read some social

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:58.250
scientist.
 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.831
They tell these are the kind of
people, under these

00:06:01.831 --> 00:06:04.410
circumstances,
who commit suicide.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.507
So they go to the scene,
they look at the dead person,

00:06:09.507 --> 00:06:12.199
look at the circumstances.
 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:17.990
This is an old man whose wife
just passed away very recently.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.194
So that must be,
of course, suicide.

00:06:20.194 --> 00:06:20.699
Right?
 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:26.673
So therefore what is suicide is
being defined by the

00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:31.476
circumstances,
rather than actually by the

00:06:31.476 --> 00:06:33.819
medical reasons.
 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.060
Okay, so let's try to struggle
a little bit this,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.057
what is suicide;
under what circumstances can we

00:06:42.057 --> 00:06:43.610
talk about suicide?
 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.149
And here is Durkheim's
definition.

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:52.247
"The term suicide"--
right?--"is applied to all

00:06:52.247 --> 00:06:54.800
cases of deaths resulting
directly,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.608
or indirectly,
a positive or a negative act of

00:07:00.608 --> 00:07:05.716
the victim himself,
which he knows will produce

00:07:05.716 --> 00:07:07.480
these results."
 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.622
Well looks like a very
complicated definition,

00:07:11.622 --> 00:07:15.120
but a very full and a very good
one.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.391
And the first point is
intention.

00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:20.459
Right?
 

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:27.819
That in order to call a death
suicide, there must be intention

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:33.370
on behalf of the person who
commits suicide.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.110
Well this intention can be
varied.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:48.230
Well the aim might not be
necessarily self-destruction.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.870
The aim may be something else.
 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.791
For instance,
you can think about suicide

00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:56.577
bombers.
 

00:07:56.577 --> 00:07:57.459
Right?
 

00:07:57.459 --> 00:08:00.370
They don't want to kill
themselves;

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.762
they want to kill others,
but they use their body as a

00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:09.735
weapon--right?--and they explode
themselves in order to cause

00:08:09.735 --> 00:08:10.978
harm to others.
 

00:08:10.978 --> 00:08:11.889
Right?
 

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:14.278
But that's clearly a case of
suicide,

00:08:14.278 --> 00:08:18.958
because they know that they
will die as a consequence of

00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.795
their action,
and therefore it can be called

00:08:22.795 --> 00:08:27.067
suicide,
though it is not aimed at the

00:08:27.067 --> 00:08:28.970
person himself.
 

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:39.907
Well the act of suicide can be
indirect, and in fact it can be

00:08:39.907 --> 00:08:41.879
negative.
 

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:48.307
Sort of you--most suicide is a
direct and positive action.

00:08:48.307 --> 00:08:49.210
Right?
 

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:56.455
You jump from the fortieth
floor--right?--and then you kill

00:08:56.455 --> 00:08:57.830
yourself.
 

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.782
You take sleeping pills,
an overdose,

00:09:00.782 --> 00:09:02.750
and you kill yourself.
 

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.668
But it can be indirect and
negative;

00:09:06.668 --> 00:09:12.672
I mean, you can starve yourself
to death, and that can be called

00:09:12.672 --> 00:09:17.817
suicide, as long as your
intention is to kill yourself.

00:09:17.817 --> 00:09:18.769
Right?
 

00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:21.950
So it becomes very tricky.
 

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:28.967
What do you do with people who
are abusing drugs or alcohol?

00:09:28.967 --> 00:09:29.918
Right?
 

00:09:29.918 --> 00:09:36.250
They may actually die as a
result of excessive alcohol or

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.399
drug consumption.
 

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:43.475
If it is not intentional,
they don't want to kill

00:09:43.475 --> 00:09:46.779
themselves;
they just like

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:55.327
boozing--right?--they just like
cocaine--right?--then it is not

00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:56.431
suicide.
 

00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:57.808
Right?
 

00:09:57.808 --> 00:10:04.626
There are lots of Russians who
have been dying in the last

00:10:04.626 --> 00:10:09.235
thirty-five years;
their numbers--especially

00:10:09.235 --> 00:10:14.201
middle-age Russian men were
dying like flies because they

00:10:14.201 --> 00:10:16.950
are drinking too much vodka.
 

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.759
In the overwhelming majority of
the cases, this is not suicide.

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:22.379
Right?
 

00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:25.057
They are depressed;
they are silly,

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:29.383
they think drinking vodka will
help their depression,

00:10:29.383 --> 00:10:34.374
and as a result they will get
liver cancer and they will die.

00:10:34.374 --> 00:10:35.289
Right?
 

00:10:35.289 --> 00:10:37.080
So it was not suicide.
 

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.278
Well, if you lock yourself into
your room, you take sleeping

00:10:42.278 --> 00:10:47.827
pills and you drink a bottle of
vodka in order to kill yourself,

00:10:47.827 --> 00:10:49.590
then it was suicide.
 

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.558
Right?
 

00:10:50.558 --> 00:10:56.629
So anyway, you have to know the
consequences of your action.

00:10:56.629 --> 00:11:01.700
You have to know that what you
do will kill yourself,

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.379
in order for your act to
qualify as a suicide.

00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:12.293
So I think this is really
beautifully done,

00:11:12.293 --> 00:11:18.488
and has been extremely
influential for social

00:11:18.488 --> 00:11:20.600
scientists.
 

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.996
As I said, it makes a very big
challenge to medical

00:11:24.996 --> 00:11:30.009
investigators who try to
determine the cause of death,

00:11:30.009 --> 00:11:36.140
because it's very difficult to
establish the intention.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.048
Right?
 

00:11:37.048 --> 00:11:41.524
And in most of the cases of
suicide, you cannot be

00:11:41.524 --> 00:11:44.720
absolutely sure of the
intention.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.966
You don't know whether this was
an accident or whether it was

00:11:48.966 --> 00:11:52.408
intentional,
unless the victim of the

00:11:52.408 --> 00:11:57.623
suicide will tell you,
leaves a letter behind and

00:11:57.623 --> 00:12:01.110
tells that I committed suicide.
 

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.240
Okay.
 

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.019
Well, as I said,
it looks like that suicide is

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:11.417
very much a very personal
action.

00:12:11.417 --> 00:12:12.480
Right?
 

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:20.664
Well occasionally people talk
about their intention to commit

00:12:20.664 --> 00:12:22.028
suicide.
 

00:12:22.028 --> 00:12:27.351
When and if they do so,
they probably will not do it.

00:12:27.351 --> 00:12:28.168
Right?
 

00:12:28.168 --> 00:12:33.089
Those who are serious about
suicide keep it to themselves,

00:12:33.089 --> 00:12:35.418
and then kill themselves.
 

00:12:35.418 --> 00:12:39.067
Those who talk about "I'm
suicidal",

00:12:39.067 --> 00:12:42.308
very often simply want to have
attention.

00:12:42.308 --> 00:12:43.120
Right?
 

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:51.013
And then even if they attempt
suicide, often it's kind of

00:12:51.013 --> 00:12:52.000
fake.
 

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.268
They're smart enough,
they just take a little

00:12:55.268 --> 00:12:58.759
overdose of sleeping pills,
but not too much.

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:02.664
Because they already told they
are suicidal--right?--their

00:13:02.664 --> 00:13:06.365
friend rushes them to the
hospital and they will be all

00:13:06.365 --> 00:13:06.775
right.
 

00:13:06.775 --> 00:13:07.528
Right?
 

00:13:07.528 --> 00:13:13.110
So anyway, it's a very
individual act.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:17.350
You usually keep your intention
to commit suicide to yourself,

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.408
rather than discussing with
somebody else.

00:13:20.408 --> 00:13:26.495
And it looks like taking your
life away is really your own

00:13:26.495 --> 00:13:27.668
business.
 

00:13:27.668 --> 00:13:31.620
So the question is,
why on earth people who study

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.900
society should be interested in
this very individual,

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.629
very private act?
 

00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:40.331
And well he said,
"Look at,

00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:42.946
for instance,
the suicide rate,

00:13:42.946 --> 00:13:46.519
how it varies across
countries."

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:51.178
And he said there is a
tremendous difference in suicide

00:13:51.178 --> 00:13:53.250
rate across countries.
 

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.823
There are countries with very
low, and there are other

00:13:56.823 --> 00:13:59.791
countries with very,
very high suicide rates,

00:13:59.791 --> 00:14:01.408
relatively speaking.
 

00:14:01.408 --> 00:14:05.904
Suicide is nowhere the
top-ranking cause of death,

00:14:05.904 --> 00:14:10.216
though in some countries,
in certain age groups,

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:15.080
it can easily enter the top
five causes of death.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.496
And, on top of this,
those countries where people

00:14:19.496 --> 00:14:24.743
commit suicide tend to be
countries where people committed

00:14:24.743 --> 00:14:27.320
suicide for a long time.
 

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.250
It's a very stable indicator.
 

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.091
Scandinavian countries are ones
where usually the suicide rate

00:14:35.091 --> 00:14:36.759
is reasonably high.
 

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:42.508
My native Hungary is a country
which for a very long time was

00:14:42.508 --> 00:14:47.010
proud of being number one in
committing suicide.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:47.970
Right?
 

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:54.960
Well incidentally--this is not
in Durkheim,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.649
but if I may add to this--there
were people who were--

00:14:58.649 --> 00:15:03.659
of course, Durkheim inspired,
and still inspires,

00:15:03.659 --> 00:15:05.500
a lot of research on suicide.
 

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.908
He has been challenged on many
questions, but he is still,

00:15:10.908 --> 00:15:15.086
after 110 years,
the agenda-setter on suicide

00:15:15.086 --> 00:15:16.320
research.
 

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.913
If any one of you become a
biologist, a sociologist,

00:15:20.913 --> 00:15:25.327
a doctor, and want to conduct
research on suicide,

00:15:25.327 --> 00:15:28.119
you will have to cite Durkheim.
 

00:15:28.119 --> 00:15:29.110
Right?
 

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.830
You have to start from Durkheim
if you are studying this.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.527
Well anyway,
there were people inspired by

00:15:36.527 --> 00:15:39.288
him and looked further inside
countries.

00:15:39.288 --> 00:15:44.260
And what is interesting,
that within countries there are

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.600
actually gigantic differences
between regions.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.100
There are some regions in these
countries with very high,

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.157
and some regions of these
countries with relatively low

00:15:56.157 --> 00:15:59.562
suicide rates,
and these are pretty constant

00:15:59.562 --> 00:16:00.320
as such.
 

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.418
Well I had a colleague--as I
said,

00:16:04.418 --> 00:16:08.360
it's probably not too parochial
for me to refer to Hungary,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.932
because now Hungary is I think
only number two or three in the

00:16:11.932 --> 00:16:13.772
world,
in suicide rate,

00:16:13.772 --> 00:16:16.970
but has been number one for a
century.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.493
So anyway, I had a colleague
who did a detailed study in

00:16:21.493 --> 00:16:25.524
Hungary about suicide,
inspired by Durkheim,

00:16:25.524 --> 00:16:30.695
and found that there were
certain regions in the country

00:16:30.695 --> 00:16:35.490
where the suicide rates were
particularly high--

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.250
as well it was low.
 

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.866
And he actually could identify
the type of people who committed

00:16:41.866 --> 00:16:45.293
suicide and the way how they
committed suicide,

00:16:45.293 --> 00:16:46.558
for instance.
 

00:16:46.558 --> 00:16:50.446
And that has been stable for a
century, as far as it was

00:16:50.446 --> 00:16:52.990
possible to go back in
statistics.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:57.091
Just to give you an
example--and it will also help

00:16:57.091 --> 00:17:02.028
us when we are looking at
Durkheim's typology of suicide.

00:17:02.028 --> 00:17:08.259
For instance,
he found that male farmers,

00:17:08.259 --> 00:17:14.190
old male farmers,
living in detached farms,

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:20.088
when their wife passes away
unexpectedly--

00:17:20.088 --> 00:17:24.460
women are expected to live
longer than men,

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.368
right?--when their wife passes
away unexpectedly,

00:17:28.368 --> 00:17:33.990
the typical way what men does:
they hang themselves in the

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.732
attic;
and this happens again and

00:17:36.732 --> 00:17:37.259
again.
 

00:17:37.259 --> 00:17:40.480
Detached farms,
old men, wife died,

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.511
people go up and hang
themselves.

00:17:43.511 --> 00:17:44.460
Right?
 

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:50.468
Suicide, to put in another way,
is a way of dying.

00:17:50.468 --> 00:17:51.450
Right?
 

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:56.730
There are some circumstances in
which in certain societies you

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.538
know that this is the answer to
your problem,

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.616
that you commit suicide.
 

00:18:02.616 --> 00:18:03.568
Right?
 

00:18:03.568 --> 00:18:07.670
If you are a man--we are
usually pretty dumb,

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.636
we don't know how to cook,
we don't know how to take care

00:18:09.636 --> 00:18:11.121
of ourselves--
you are old,

00:18:11.121 --> 00:18:13.808
your wife died,
so what do you do?

00:18:13.808 --> 00:18:16.940
You commit
suicide--right?--under certain

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.035
circumstances.
 

00:18:18.035 --> 00:18:18.740
Right?
 

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.288
Anyway, I think this is a--this
is why it makes it interesting--

00:18:22.288 --> 00:18:25.260
right?--for social scientists,
that there are interesting

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.828
social patterns,
cultural patterns,

00:18:27.828 --> 00:18:30.170
how people commit suicide.
 

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:34.598
And Durkheim will work on this
as much.

00:18:34.598 --> 00:18:38.250
And then he said there are,
in fact, large,

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.423
big historical events,
which do have an impact on

00:18:42.423 --> 00:18:43.990
suicide rates.
 

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.653
You would think if there is a
big social turmoil,

00:18:47.653 --> 00:18:50.019
then suicide rate will go up.
 

00:18:50.019 --> 00:18:51.190
You are wrong.
 

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:55.226
If there is a big social
turmoil, suicide rate tends to

00:18:55.226 --> 00:18:58.440
be going down,
because there is--in times of

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.730
revolution, people don't commit
suicide.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:05.421
Anyway, his point is that
suicide is a collective

00:19:05.421 --> 00:19:06.267
phenomenon.
 

00:19:06.267 --> 00:19:06.960
Right?
 

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.328
Somehow it is socially
determined as a phenomenon.

00:19:11.328 --> 00:19:14.640
Okay, now this is the typology
of suicide.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.554
And I have been struggling with
this, and people who know much

00:19:19.554 --> 00:19:24.548
more about Durkheim have been
struggling with this typology.

00:19:24.548 --> 00:19:31.900
And what of course I was trying
to do,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.828
as others were trying to do,
to do a 2 x 2 table--

00:19:34.828 --> 00:19:40.220
right?--and to put these types
of suicide in this 2 x 2 table.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:44.623
Durkheim, in writing about
suicide, seemed to make a

00:19:44.623 --> 00:19:49.976
distinction between the question
of integration and regulation.

00:19:49.976 --> 00:19:50.838
Right?
 

00:19:50.838 --> 00:19:58.115
Integration means how tightly
organized a group or society is

00:19:58.115 --> 00:20:00.298
in which you live.
 

00:20:00.298 --> 00:20:01.390
Right?
 

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.530
And as I already pointed out in
the earlier

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:10.952
lecture--right?--Durkheim has
this idea of normal versus

00:20:10.952 --> 00:20:12.630
pathological.
 

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:20.463
And I will talk about this in
more detail in the last lecture

00:20:20.463 --> 00:20:24.118
on Durkheim's methodology.
 

00:20:24.118 --> 00:20:29.929
He has this interesting idea
that what is normal is the kind

00:20:29.929 --> 00:20:31.210
of typical.
 

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.598
To put it very crudely,
normal is kind of the average.

00:20:35.598 --> 00:20:40.150
If it is too much or too
little, this is pathological or

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.660
abnormal;
that is the idea.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.951
So therefore one dimension in
which he uses the typology is

00:20:47.951 --> 00:20:53.424
integration--right?--how well
integrated we are into a social

00:20:53.424 --> 00:20:55.250
group we are in.
 

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.756
And that can be too high or it
can be too low.

00:20:58.756 --> 00:20:59.380
Right?
 

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:05.476
And both too high integration
and too low integration can be

00:21:05.476 --> 00:21:08.990
the cause of social pathologies.
 

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.630
And one of the social
pathologies is that you kill

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:12.115
yourself.
 

00:21:12.115 --> 00:21:12.598
Right?
 

00:21:12.598 --> 00:21:18.828
And the other dimension is
regulation;

00:21:18.828 --> 00:21:24.714
how much, how tight,
how rigorous the norms are

00:21:24.714 --> 00:21:28.808
which regulates your behavior.
 

00:21:28.808 --> 00:21:32.920
Again, it can be too high or it
can be too low.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:38.880
And it will affect also the
pathologies.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:46.010
If you are away from the golden
middle road--that's what

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:50.420
Durkheim's idea of modernity is.
 

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:55.710
If you are on the golden middle
road, then you are normal.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:59.818
If you deviate,
you are abnormal.

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:03.451
This is a very problematic
proposition in Durkheim,

00:22:03.451 --> 00:22:05.338
and has been challenged.
 

00:22:05.338 --> 00:22:09.200
Well the big trouble is,
are these two dimensions

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.980
independent from each other,
or they overlap?

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:18.246
And it's really they are not
really completely independent

00:22:18.246 --> 00:22:19.910
from each other.
 

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.480
This is why you could not put
this into a 2 x 2 table--

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:31.365
right?--because some of the
types of abnormalities can be

00:22:31.365 --> 00:22:38.618
only understood in integration
or in terms of regulation.

00:22:38.618 --> 00:22:42.910
But anyway, I think this is
probably the best way I can come

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.972
up with,
or in the Durkheim literature

00:22:45.972 --> 00:22:51.078
the best way I have read,
basically using these two

00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:59.019
dimensions as--
not as a 2 x 2 table;

00:22:59.019 --> 00:23:06.892
sort of, to put it this way,
rather than a 2 x 2 table,

00:23:06.892 --> 00:23:10.537
it's like two dimensions.
 

00:23:10.537 --> 00:23:11.848
Right?
 

00:23:11.848 --> 00:23:13.714
And then you have the two types
over here.

00:23:13.714 --> 00:23:14.078
Right?
 

00:23:14.078 --> 00:23:19.346
Too high and too
low--right?--and you have

00:23:19.346 --> 00:23:24.230
integration and you have
regulation.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:31.970
And high and low and high and
low;

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.813
this is how you can do it.
 

00:23:33.813 --> 00:23:34.309
Right?
 

00:23:34.309 --> 00:23:35.910
You can conceptualize it.
 

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:42.595
But it doesn't work,
you put it in a normal 2 x 2

00:23:42.595 --> 00:23:43.710
table.
 

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:44.670
Okay.
 

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.192
Well let me start to talk about
egoistic suicide.

00:23:48.192 --> 00:23:48.779
Right?
 

00:23:48.779 --> 00:23:57.692
And therefore--right?--egoistic
suicide has something to do with

00:23:57.692 --> 00:24:03.919
social integration,
and it is a case when the

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:08.730
social integration is too low.
 

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.605
And he said,
well the more weakened the

00:24:12.605 --> 00:24:18.214
group to which the person who
committed suicide belongs,

00:24:18.214 --> 00:24:21.480
the less he depends on them.
 

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.588
And he calls this egoism. Right?
 

00:24:26.588 --> 00:24:33.008
If you don't--you are yourself
and you are not--do not feel

00:24:33.008 --> 00:24:38.983
responsible to your own group,
and therefore you may be

00:24:38.983 --> 00:24:41.529
committing suicide.
 

00:24:41.529 --> 00:24:46.980
Again, people who are
considering suicide--

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:54.396
just to show the lack of egoism
and the importance of the

00:24:54.396 --> 00:24:57.183
group--
well you may think you have a

00:24:57.183 --> 00:25:00.318
good enough reason to kill
yourself: "My life doesn't

00:25:00.318 --> 00:25:01.750
have any purpose."
 

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.965
"My boy or girlfriend left
me, so therefore I'd rather kill

00:25:05.965 --> 00:25:06.970
myself."
 

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.662
And then they say,
"Well I can't really do

00:25:10.662 --> 00:25:12.106
this to Mom."
 

00:25:12.106 --> 00:25:12.828
Right?
 

00:25:12.828 --> 00:25:16.550
"I cannot disappoint my
parents."

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:17.259
Right?
 

00:25:17.259 --> 00:25:20.942
So therefore you are not--you
cannot act egoistically.

00:25:20.942 --> 00:25:21.500
Right?
 

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.717
You belong to a group,
and because the tightness,

00:25:24.717 --> 00:25:28.940
the solidarity with the group
prevents you to commit suicide.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:35.191
So in order to act egoistically
means that you don't care about

00:25:35.191 --> 00:25:39.930
others, or you care first of all
about yourself,

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.140
as such.
 

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.779
Well the solidarity can be
different.

00:25:43.779 --> 00:25:48.019
It can be religion,
it can be family,

00:25:48.019 --> 00:25:51.200
or it can be the society.
 

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.868
And let me speak to this.
 

00:25:55.868 --> 00:26:00.054
And if this religion,
family or society,

00:26:00.054 --> 00:26:06.278
as such, offers sufficient
solidarity, then you will not be

00:26:06.278 --> 00:26:09.390
likely to commit suicide.
 

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:16.237
Okay, so let me talk about
religion and suicide,

00:26:16.237 --> 00:26:23.521
and also a bit about how
religion and education are

00:26:23.521 --> 00:26:28.328
linked together with suicide.
 

00:26:28.328 --> 00:26:32.940
Durkheim does here something
really path-breaking.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.492
Though the statistical
technologies were not available,

00:26:37.492 --> 00:26:41.792
he really does the logic of
multivariate statistical

00:26:41.792 --> 00:26:42.890
analysis.
 

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:47.294
He almost does a regression
model, to put it this way,

00:26:47.294 --> 00:26:48.788
without numbers.
 

00:26:48.788 --> 00:26:51.700
But that's the logic of the
argument.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.172
And then he's talking about
what he calls the Jewish

00:26:55.172 --> 00:26:56.328
exceptionalism.
 

00:26:56.328 --> 00:27:02.676
Well this will be interesting,
because the fundamental idea is

00:27:02.676 --> 00:27:06.651
that,
in fact, generally people who

00:27:06.651 --> 00:27:12.174
are more educated are more
likely to commit suicide.

00:27:12.174 --> 00:27:13.150
Right?
 

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:20.240
There is also a relationship
between religion and suicide.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.098
Protestants are more likely to
commit suicide;

00:27:24.098 --> 00:27:27.900
Catholics less likely to commit
suicide.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.779
Catholics are less educated;
Protestants are more educated.

00:27:32.779 --> 00:27:35.738
Being more educated,
the Protestant,

00:27:35.738 --> 00:27:39.455
makes you more susceptible to
commit suicide,

00:27:39.455 --> 00:27:40.640
he argues.
 

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.710
But Jews are an exception.
 

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.577
Because Jewish suicide rate is
generally very low,

00:27:46.577 --> 00:27:49.420
and Jews are very highly
educated.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.380
So that's the Jewish puzzle.
 

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:51.868
Right?
 

00:27:51.868 --> 00:27:55.390
Why on earth highly educated
Jews don't kill themselves?

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:59.315
If you are--right?--a Lutheran,
or a Presbyterian,

00:27:59.315 --> 00:28:02.438
and you are educated,
you kill yourself.

00:28:02.438 --> 00:28:03.240
Right?
 

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.140
Why Jews don't? Right?
 

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.470
That's the puzzle.
 

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:11.480
What is the relationship
between education and religion?

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.152
And why on earth education
leads to a higher level of

00:28:16.152 --> 00:28:16.871
suicide?
 

00:28:16.871 --> 00:28:17.680
Right?
 

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:23.690
Okay, let me therefore start
with this one.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:29.115
Well as I said,
he generally finds that there

00:28:29.115 --> 00:28:35.160
is a higher rate of suicide
among Protestants,

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:40.769
and lower rates among
Catholics, and Jews have the

00:28:40.769 --> 00:28:47.525
lowest suicide rates among the
Judeo-Christian sphere of the

00:28:47.525 --> 00:28:50.523
world;
that's what he studied,

00:28:50.523 --> 00:28:52.460
the European countries.
 

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:57.338
In fact, Islamic suicide rate
is also low.

00:28:57.338 --> 00:29:05.760
Well, one possible easy answer
would be that there are stricter

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:13.640
penalties if you are Catholic
and if you commit suicide;

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.650
that's why you don't commit
suicide.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:16.108
Right?
 

00:29:16.108 --> 00:29:18.680
But that's not quite true,
Durkheim argues.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.170
Right?
 

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:24.069
In fact, all religions are
against suicide;

00:29:24.069 --> 00:29:25.950
no religion allows suicide.
 

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:32.650
Well Roman Catholics may be a
little more rigorous about it.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:36.088
You do not a get a religious
burial.

00:29:36.088 --> 00:29:41.365
I think most Roman Catholic
priests would not bury somebody

00:29:41.365 --> 00:29:45.890
who committed suicide,
in most countries,

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:53.140
while Protestant ministers may
perform a burial ceremony.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.557
But I don't think if you commit
suicide that really you are all

00:29:57.557 --> 00:30:00.906
that concerned where and how you
will be buried.

00:30:00.906 --> 00:30:01.618
Right?
 

00:30:01.618 --> 00:30:05.708
Now, so the question is why?
 

00:30:05.708 --> 00:30:06.730
Right?
 

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:10.442
The first answer,
that some religions prohibit

00:30:10.442 --> 00:30:14.320
suicide more than others is not
very persuasive,

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.868
because all religions prohibit
suicide.

00:30:17.868 --> 00:30:23.048
Well, and here he comes with
the idea of integration.

00:30:23.048 --> 00:30:28.493
He said Protestantism is a less
strongly integrated church than

00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:32.269
the Catholic Church--less of a
community.

00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:38.465
And Judaism actually even more
tightly integrated,

00:30:38.465 --> 00:30:42.259
even more so of a community.
 

00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:47.135
So therefore it leaves
relatively little room for

00:30:47.135 --> 00:30:51.404
egoistic suicide,
because the high level of

00:30:51.404 --> 00:30:53.029
integration.
 

00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:57.205
And here the rank order is a
relatively low level among

00:30:57.205 --> 00:31:02.078
Protestants, higher level among
Catholics, and particularly high

00:31:02.078 --> 00:31:03.240
among Jews.
 

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:12.890
Well how on earth comes
education into the picture?

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:21.342
Well he says as the common and
customary prejudice is

00:31:21.342 --> 00:31:30.769
weakening, there is an increase
in the trend of suicide.

00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:36.425
Well it's not exactly prejudice
in the most conventional sense

00:31:36.425 --> 00:31:39.950
of the term, what he's referring
to.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:45.580
He's referring here to the
question what we kind of

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:50.423
overcome with education,
generally speaking.

00:31:50.423 --> 00:31:51.548
Right?
 

00:31:51.548 --> 00:31:57.904
That if you are becoming more
educated, you will have less of

00:31:57.904 --> 00:31:59.915
accepted doctrines.
 

00:31:59.915 --> 00:32:00.868
Right?
 

00:32:00.868 --> 00:32:04.500
Education--right?--is a
critical exercise.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.210
Right?
 

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:08.108
That's what I was trying to do
in this course--

00:32:08.108 --> 00:32:12.020
right?--to challenge
you--right?--to be a critical

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:15.431
theorist--
right?--to subject your own

00:32:15.431 --> 00:32:18.788
consciousness to critical
scrutiny,

00:32:18.788 --> 00:32:22.849
and to subject the theorists
you have read to critical

00:32:22.849 --> 00:32:23.539
scrutiny.
 

00:32:23.539 --> 00:32:24.230
Right?
 

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:28.663
That's why I asked you in the
test to do-- find a

00:32:28.663 --> 00:32:33.836
puzzle--right?--and take sides
in this puzzle--offer some

00:32:33.836 --> 00:32:37.440
criticism of some of the
theorists.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.380
That's what education is all
about.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.971
And therefore prejudice as
dogma is declining.

00:32:42.971 --> 00:32:43.608
Right?
 

00:32:43.608 --> 00:32:47.931
And if dogma is declining,
there are less given

00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:53.473
stereotypes for us we believe
in, then we are more likely to

00:32:53.473 --> 00:32:55.259
commit suicide.
 

00:32:55.259 --> 00:32:57.384
This is a kind of
weakening--right?--of the

00:32:57.384 --> 00:32:58.598
collective conscience.
 

00:32:58.598 --> 00:33:02.700
It's becoming more of an
individual consciousness;

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:08.929
the critical thinker is
becoming more of an individual

00:33:08.929 --> 00:33:10.808
consciousness.
 

00:33:10.808 --> 00:33:15.281
Well and he said well,
they go together with religion,

00:33:15.281 --> 00:33:20.260
because Catholics tended to be
less educated and Protestants

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.778
more educated.
 

00:33:21.778 --> 00:33:25.088
I don't know how much this
still stands up to scrutiny.

00:33:25.088 --> 00:33:30.084
But it's certainly true that
traditionally Protestant

00:33:30.084 --> 00:33:35.558
churches did attribute a greater
emphasis to education.

00:33:35.558 --> 00:33:43.846
One big reason was the
relationship between believers

00:33:43.846 --> 00:33:46.714
and the clergymen.
 

00:33:46.714 --> 00:33:48.150
Right?
 

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:53.263
In the classical Roman Catholic
theology, the clergyman

00:33:53.263 --> 00:33:56.673
interprets the
Bible--right?--for the

00:33:56.673 --> 00:33:58.000
believers.
 

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.864
The big--right?--revolution of
Reformation was that they

00:34:04.864 --> 00:34:09.291
translated the Bible--
right?--into native

00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:13.059
languages--and printing was just
made available--

00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:17.150
and started to print the Bible,
and they wanted lay people to

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.309
read the Bible.
 

00:34:18.309 --> 00:34:22.827
Well in the Medieval Roman
Catholic Church,

00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:26.161
only the priest read the Bible.
 

00:34:26.161 --> 00:34:27.130
Right?
 

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:32.246
Sort of Protestantism went
together with mass education,

00:34:32.246 --> 00:34:37.269
massive public education,
and an emphasis on education:

00:34:37.269 --> 00:34:39.315
how to read and write.
 

00:34:39.315 --> 00:34:40.340
Right?
 

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:45.786
So therefore I think there is a
good claim to be made that on

00:34:45.786 --> 00:34:48.779
the long-run,
and generally speaking,

00:34:48.779 --> 00:34:52.460
Protestants tended to be more
educated than Catholics.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.371
I doubt whether you would find
much religious differences in

00:34:56.371 --> 00:34:58.030
contemporary societies.
 

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:02.385
But that, in a way,
was simply a correlation

00:35:02.385 --> 00:35:05.730
pointing in the same direction.
 

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:11.041
And he also makes this
point--which is by now utterly

00:35:11.041 --> 00:35:16.559
untrue--right?--women are not
less educated in advanced

00:35:16.559 --> 00:35:18.909
societies than men.
 

00:35:18.909 --> 00:35:23.166
Women are actually by now more
educated than men,

00:35:23.166 --> 00:35:27.954
in the advanced Western
countries, including the United

00:35:27.954 --> 00:35:28.574
States.
 

00:35:28.574 --> 00:35:29.550
Right?
 

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:34.367
In no time you guys,
you really have to work harder

00:35:34.367 --> 00:35:39.570
to make sure that you can catch
up with the ladies--

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.981
right?--because they will be
better educated than you will

00:35:43.981 --> 00:35:44.213
be.
 

00:35:44.213 --> 00:35:44.909
Right?
 

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:48.869
But anyway, in his times women
were less educated than men,

00:35:48.869 --> 00:35:52.010
and they were less likely to
commit suicide.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.070
I think that's also still the
case.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:57.815
I think women are still less,
generally speaking,

00:35:57.815 --> 00:36:00.780
still less likely to commit
suicide.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:05.538
In fact, I think women are more
likely to attempt suicide,

00:36:05.538 --> 00:36:10.630
but completed suicide rate is
much higher among men than among

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:11.130
women.
 

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.050
Right?
 

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.619
That's, I think,
the basic finding.

00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:18.099
But anyway, here it's more a
methodological point.

00:36:18.099 --> 00:36:22.420
I doubt that whether the
Catholic/Protestant distinction

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.800
still stands,
and it certainly doesn't stand

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.585
for women.
 

00:36:26.585 --> 00:36:27.449
Right?
 

00:36:27.449 --> 00:36:29.704
Women by now,
in the Western advanced

00:36:29.704 --> 00:36:32.003
countries,
in almost every country,

00:36:32.003 --> 00:36:34.170
are better educated than men
are,

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:37.849
especially the younger
generation are better educated.

00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:41.811
But the methodological point is
interesting.

00:36:41.811 --> 00:36:42.550
Right?
 

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:45.572
As I said, he's beginning to do
multivariate analysis.

00:36:45.572 --> 00:36:46.030
Right?
 

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.860
So the dependent variable is
tendency to suicide.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.673
And he has a little regression
model.

00:36:52.673 --> 00:36:53.300
Right?
 

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:58.333
He looks into the regression
model--countries and gender and

00:36:58.333 --> 00:37:03.367
education and religion--and
tries to explain the variance in

00:37:03.367 --> 00:37:05.159
the suicide rate.
 

00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:10.748
In terms of research design,
this is very beautifully done.

00:37:10.748 --> 00:37:11.518
Right?
 

00:37:11.518 --> 00:37:14.625
This is social
science--right?--as we know it

00:37:14.625 --> 00:37:15.190
today.
 

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:20.972
Well, and there is the
Judaistic puzzle.

00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:22.159
Right?
 

00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:27.943
Well Jews--I think this
probably is still true--is

00:37:27.943 --> 00:37:31.719
better educated than non-Jews.
 

00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:34.768
Again, I would not swear on it.
 

00:37:34.768 --> 00:37:39.539
I really have not looked at
data on religion and education.

00:37:39.539 --> 00:37:43.753
But certainly generally has
been true, at that time when

00:37:43.753 --> 00:37:48.119
Durkheim was writing about it,
late nineteenth century;

00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:52.063
Jews were highly educated,
in Europe in particular,

00:37:52.063 --> 00:37:56.559
and by the 1920s and '30s in
the United States as well.

00:37:56.559 --> 00:38:02.688
Though they are highly
educated, well they are less

00:38:02.688 --> 00:38:06.000
likely to commit suicide.
 

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.681
So there is a
trouble--right?--with his

00:38:08.681 --> 00:38:11.574
explanatory
model--right?--what's going on

00:38:11.574 --> 00:38:12.210
here.
 

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:22.659
And then he tries to understand
what is the purpose of learning?

00:38:22.659 --> 00:38:26.275
And he said the purpose of
learning among Jews is

00:38:26.275 --> 00:38:27.179
different.
 

00:38:27.179 --> 00:38:29.789
And that's the claim.
 

00:38:29.789 --> 00:38:34.393
A Jew seeks to learn,
not in order to replace his

00:38:34.393 --> 00:38:39.188
collective prejudices,
but merely to better arm for

00:38:39.188 --> 00:38:40.434
the struggle.
 

00:38:40.434 --> 00:38:41.489
Right?
 

00:38:41.489 --> 00:38:47.880
So you read the Talmud. Right?
 

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:52.523
You go to the rabbi and you go
through all kind of education to

00:38:52.523 --> 00:38:55.518
better understand the Holy
Scripture--

00:38:55.518 --> 00:38:59.342
right?--and the interpretations
of the Holy Scripture.

00:38:59.342 --> 00:38:59.920
Right?
 

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.146
You got a lot of
education--right?--if you are

00:39:03.146 --> 00:39:05.942
preparing yourself for your bar
mitzvah.

00:39:05.942 --> 00:39:06.659
Right?
 

00:39:06.659 --> 00:39:10.371
You even have to learn
Hebrew--right?--to pass your bar

00:39:10.371 --> 00:39:11.059
mitzvah.
 

00:39:11.059 --> 00:39:14.987
You sweat blood probably
meanwhile while doing so.

00:39:14.987 --> 00:39:15.630
Right?
 

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.347
But this is not to challenge
the doctrine,

00:39:19.347 --> 00:39:22.882
it is to better understand the
doctrine.

00:39:22.882 --> 00:39:23.789
Right?
 

00:39:23.789 --> 00:39:26.567
And therefore it doesn't
undermine the collective

00:39:26.567 --> 00:39:27.320
conscience.
 

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:31.670
This education strengthens the
collective conscience.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:32.340
Right?
 

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.489
I think that's at least
Durkheim's claim.

00:39:34.489 --> 00:39:35.719
Very interesting.
 

00:39:35.719 --> 00:39:37.710
Again, I think take it
methodologically.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:42.347
I think methodological
formidable what this guy is

00:39:42.347 --> 00:39:45.378
doing--right?--as early as 1897.
 

00:39:45.378 --> 00:39:46.230
Right?
 

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:52.952
This is the kind of stuff
today, if any one of you will do

00:39:52.952 --> 00:39:56.420
a Ph.D.--
right?--in political science or

00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.181
economics or sociology,
if you have this kind of

00:40:00.181 --> 00:40:03.331
research design,
your mentor will say,

00:40:03.331 --> 00:40:04.659
"Go for it.
 

00:40:04.659 --> 00:40:06.869
That's the right way to do
it." Right?

00:40:06.869 --> 00:40:08.429
Anyway, so that's.
 

00:40:08.429 --> 00:40:14.617
So well he says education
therefore--it's a very

00:40:14.617 --> 00:40:18.039
interesting idea,
right?

00:40:18.039 --> 00:40:20.153
He now does a kind of
interaction

00:40:20.153 --> 00:40:23.193
effect--right?--between
education and religion,

00:40:23.193 --> 00:40:26.099
and he looks at this
interaction effect;

00:40:26.099 --> 00:40:28.739
how these two affect each other.
 

00:40:28.739 --> 00:40:33.079
He said it depends what
education is all about.

00:40:33.079 --> 00:40:34.018
You know?
 

00:40:34.018 --> 00:40:38.329
Education, if it is weakening
the collective conscience,

00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:42.559
makes you just critical of
everything what you learned,

00:40:42.559 --> 00:40:49.655
will be a cause of suicide;
otherwise it's actually

00:40:49.655 --> 00:40:57.570
important to reinforce you in
society.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:59.539
And now family and suicide.
 

00:40:59.539 --> 00:41:02.911
This is the point what I did
make.

00:41:02.911 --> 00:41:03.730
Right?
 

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:14.360
In fact, if you are integrated
in a family, you are less likely

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.789
to commit suicide.
 

00:41:17.789 --> 00:41:22.139
And he said well there should
be--if that is true--

00:41:22.139 --> 00:41:27.849
there should be some evidence
that people who are married will

00:41:27.849 --> 00:41:32.715
be less likely to kill
themselves than people who are

00:41:32.715 --> 00:41:35.150
unmarried and widowed.
 

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.518
And that is actually the case.
 

00:41:38.518 --> 00:41:45.034
Generally, by the way,
marriage seems to have a health

00:41:45.034 --> 00:41:46.262
advantage.
 

00:41:46.262 --> 00:41:47.369
Right?
 

00:41:47.369 --> 00:41:52.998
If you are considering never to
get married, think about your

00:41:52.998 --> 00:41:53.655
health.
 

00:41:53.655 --> 00:41:54.500
Right?
 

00:41:54.500 --> 00:42:00.811
If you get married,
statistics will tell you,

00:42:00.811 --> 00:42:06.347
you will live longer;
and actually they also tell

00:42:06.347 --> 00:42:10.659
you, you will live happier,
than if you stay alone.

00:42:10.659 --> 00:42:15.860
Well, and you probably are less
likely to commit suicide.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:20.400
So that's what he called
matrimonial immunity to suicide.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.250
"Why?" he says.
 

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:26.855
And it's again incredible what
the guy is doing here.

00:42:26.855 --> 00:42:27.409
Right?
 

00:42:27.409 --> 00:42:32.215
He said, well one possible
explanation is that because you

00:42:32.215 --> 00:42:35.588
are in a
community--right?--therefore you

00:42:35.588 --> 00:42:37.949
will not commit suicide.
 

00:42:37.949 --> 00:42:40.489
"I cannot do to my spouse
to kill myself,

00:42:40.489 --> 00:42:44.789
because my spouse will blame
him or herself for my death,

00:42:44.789 --> 00:42:48.168
and I don't want to cause harm
to my spouse."

00:42:48.168 --> 00:42:48.719
Right?
 

00:42:48.719 --> 00:42:50.539
Therefore I don't commit
suicide.

00:42:50.539 --> 00:42:55.440
As I said, young people often
don't commit suicide with

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.889
respect to their parents.
 

00:42:57.889 --> 00:43:04.224
But he said--and this is really
extraordinary--he said that it

00:43:04.224 --> 00:43:08.170
can be caused by matrimonial
selection.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:09.210
Right?
 

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:13.322
People who are more likely to
commit suicide,

00:43:13.322 --> 00:43:16.219
to begin with,
may not marry.

00:43:16.219 --> 00:43:20.387
Well those of you who took
statistics classes,

00:43:20.387 --> 00:43:23.630
you know what he's talking
about;

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:29.730
though at that time this was
not in statistics at all.

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:32.239
It is called the selection
problem.

00:43:32.239 --> 00:43:32.829
Right?
 

00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:35.139
This is exactly the selection
problem.

00:43:35.139 --> 00:43:40.545
He said we cannot really tell
why people who are married are

00:43:40.545 --> 00:43:45.585
less likely to commit suicide,
because it is possible people

00:43:45.585 --> 00:43:49.480
with intention to commit suicide
will not get married--

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:53.340
right?--because they are lonely
people to begin with,

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.400
and this is why they did not
marry.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.925
So the lower frequency of
suicide among married people is

00:43:58.925 --> 00:44:03.597
not the consequence of marriage,
but marriage is the consequence

00:44:03.597 --> 00:44:07.260
of people's likelihood not to
commit suicide.

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:11.592
This is the classical example
what is called the sample

00:44:11.592 --> 00:44:13.036
selection problem.
 

00:44:13.036 --> 00:44:13.760
Right?
 

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.019
And the only--you know what the
only solution for this is?

00:44:17.019 --> 00:44:21.860
Experimental method. Right?
 

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.806
That's the only way how you
could deal with this,

00:44:24.806 --> 00:44:26.097
to solve the problem.
 

00:44:26.097 --> 00:44:26.650
Right?
 

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:31.974
And if you took with Professor
Green a political science

00:44:31.974 --> 00:44:35.460
course, you know exactly what I
mean.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.429
Right?
 

00:44:36.429 --> 00:44:39.068
Social scientists really should
do experiment:

00:44:39.068 --> 00:44:40.300
random assignments.
 

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.458
You could really come rid of
the problem of this sample

00:44:44.458 --> 00:44:48.773
selection bias if you could
randomly assign people to get

00:44:48.773 --> 00:44:53.416
married or not to get married,
and then they will get married

00:44:53.416 --> 00:44:57.679
or not get married,
and then to see whether it had

00:44:57.679 --> 00:44:59.420
an effect or not.
 

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:02.590
Unfortunately in society we
can't really do random

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:03.367
assignments.
 

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:03.949
Right?
 

00:45:03.949 --> 00:45:07.246
We hardly can assign people to
get married or not to get

00:45:07.246 --> 00:45:10.840
married, and follow it up thirty
years later whether they are

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.559
still alive.
 

00:45:11.559 --> 00:45:12.219
Right?
 

00:45:12.219 --> 00:45:13.969
That's the problem.
 

00:45:13.969 --> 00:45:18.574
But otherwise there is--really
statisticians do all kind of big

00:45:18.574 --> 00:45:22.510
tricks around this,
but it really cannot be solved.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:26.179
The real solution would be only
the experimental method.

00:45:26.179 --> 00:45:31.280
But what is formidable about
this--right?--that he is well

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.980
ahead of himself.
 

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.523
And the whole problem of sample
selection issue,

00:45:36.523 --> 00:45:39.389
I came across of this in
statistics.

00:45:39.389 --> 00:45:43.239
In the 1980s,
that's when it became a big

00:45:43.239 --> 00:45:45.070
thing, the 1980s.
 

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:49.445
Sample selection model--how you
control for the sample selection

00:45:49.445 --> 00:45:50.139
problem.
 

00:45:50.139 --> 00:45:53.588
And he knew about the
problem--not the statistical

00:45:53.588 --> 00:45:57.530
one, but the research design
problem--right?--in 1897.

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:02.907
Okay, but he said well there is
still data which supports

00:46:02.907 --> 00:46:07.230
actually that matrimonialism has
an effect.

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:11.289
Well society. The same;
that's counterintuitive.

00:46:11.289 --> 00:46:15.010
He said if there are great
social disturbances,

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:18.730
then actually social sentiments
are at high.

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:20.110
Revolution, right?
 

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.900
You feel identified with your
country in the revolutionary

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:24.760
cause and you do not commit
suicide;

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.630
if otherwise you would have
committed suicide.

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:31.079
Therefore suicide rate will be
going down.

00:46:31.079 --> 00:46:36.969
So anyway, this was about
egoistic suicide.

00:46:36.969 --> 00:46:41.480
Now let me--I am running out of
time very badly.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.989
Altruistic suicide.
 

00:46:44.989 --> 00:46:49.514
Well altruistic suicide is
happening when social

00:46:49.514 --> 00:46:53.969
integration is far too high,
unbearably high,

00:46:53.969 --> 00:46:58.929
and that's when people will be
committing what he calls

00:46:58.929 --> 00:47:00.949
altruistic suicide.
 

00:47:00.949 --> 00:47:05.963
And this can happen--for
instance he said,

00:47:05.963 --> 00:47:10.853
people, old men,
the example what I gave,

00:47:10.853 --> 00:47:16.561
old age, commits suicide;
women occasionally on the death

00:47:16.561 --> 00:47:20.605
of their husband commits suicide
because they think this is

00:47:20.605 --> 00:47:22.139
expected from them.
 

00:47:22.139 --> 00:47:25.867
And traditionally often
followers or servants,

00:47:25.867 --> 00:47:29.760
on the death of the chief,
committed suicide.

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.865
So we are talking about
altruistic suicide,

00:47:32.865 --> 00:47:37.231
because people commit suicide
because they think it is their

00:47:37.231 --> 00:47:39.005
duty to kill themselves.
 

00:47:39.005 --> 00:47:39.820
Right?
 

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:46.335
And this is a sacrifice which
is imposed by society for

00:47:46.335 --> 00:47:49.713
something like a social end.
 

00:47:49.713 --> 00:47:50.800
Right?
 

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.059
It can be obligatory in certain
societies.

00:47:53.059 --> 00:47:57.777
If you lost a battle and you
were a Japanese

00:47:57.777 --> 00:48:03.922
soldier--right?--you committed
hari-kiri, if you were the

00:48:03.922 --> 00:48:05.239
general.
 

00:48:05.239 --> 00:48:09.195
Even in the Second World War,
they committed hari-kiri,

00:48:09.195 --> 00:48:10.659
killed themselves.
 

00:48:10.659 --> 00:48:18.409
Or it actually can be even kind
of mystical suicide.

00:48:18.409 --> 00:48:21.427
For instance,
as you know Hindus occasionally

00:48:21.427 --> 00:48:24.719
jump into the Ganges River to
kill themselves.

00:48:24.719 --> 00:48:31.460
Well today he said this is a
relatively rare incident.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.460
But it happens in the Army.
 

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:37.070
He says soldiers kill
themselves, not because they are

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:40.748
not sufficiently integrated but
because they are highly

00:48:40.748 --> 00:48:43.304
integrated,
and therefore that

00:48:43.304 --> 00:48:46.960
individualism is weak,
and that's why they commit

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.550
suicide.
 

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:52.117
And now about anomic suicide.
 

00:48:52.117 --> 00:48:53.219
Right?
 

00:48:53.219 --> 00:48:58.690
Well you know anomie;
anomie is the lack of social

00:48:58.690 --> 00:48:59.619
regulation.
 

00:48:59.619 --> 00:49:04.300
And indeed he said if you find
yourself in ever-changing

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:09.065
situations where value system is
changing, you are likely

00:49:09.065 --> 00:49:12.300
to--more likely to commit
suicide.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:21.869
And well it can be a reason for
economic reasons.

00:49:21.869 --> 00:49:25.250
Traditionally institutions
decline.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:30.362
Suicide during the Great
Depression, as the bank

00:49:30.362 --> 00:49:34.989
collapsed, was frequent;
people were jumping out of the

00:49:34.989 --> 00:49:35.469
window.
 

00:49:35.469 --> 00:49:39.708
And actually a few of them
happened also last fall,

00:49:39.708 --> 00:49:43.099
with the turndown of the stock
market.

00:49:43.099 --> 00:49:48.900
And it can be--another good
example is domestic anomie.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:54.711
Your spouse dies or you get
divorced, and then the suicide

00:49:54.711 --> 00:49:56.650
rate is frequent.
 

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:58.750
And finally fatalistic suicide.
 

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:03.179
As I pointed out,
Durkheim's notion of fatalism

00:50:03.179 --> 00:50:08.090
is a twin concept to Marx's
notion of alienation.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.425
There is too much regulation
and not enough social

00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:15.539
integration;
such as the case of slaves or

00:50:15.539 --> 00:50:19.898
childless women,
then they tend to commit

00:50:19.898 --> 00:50:21.969
suicide as well.
 

00:50:21.969 --> 00:50:26.630
So, so much about Durkheim and
suicide.

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:29.838
And next lecture,
again I will talk to the

00:50:29.838 --> 00:50:34.849
questions briefly before we go
on to Durkheim's methodologies.

00:50:34.849 --> 00:50:36.480
So do come.
 

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.650
You know?
 

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:39.449
It'll be helpful for the test.
 

00:50:39.449 --> 00:50:44.090
And I appreciate actually your
class attendance.

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:47.369
It was wonderful all along.
 

00:50:47.369 --> 00:50:53.000

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.176
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: What I did

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:09.111
yesterday, or Monday,
was to describe to you the

00:00:09.111 --> 00:00:14.092
First Law of thermodynamics.
So, let me remind you what the

00:00:14.092 --> 00:00:18.183
context was.
We're going to study a system,

00:00:18.183 --> 00:00:23.957
that's our thermodynamic
system, and for all our purposes

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:29.937
you can imagine that to be some
amount of ideal gas trapped

00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:34.990
inside this piston and cylinder
combination.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.565
We put some weights or maybe
some sand on top to keep the

00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:45.052
piston where we want it.
The gas has a certain pressure

00:00:45.052 --> 00:00:51.216
and a certain volume and we
represent that by a point in

00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:56.480
this diagram.
That defines the state.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.079
That's called the state of the
gas.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.850
On a microscopic level,
the state is very complicated,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.394
right?
There are 10^(23) atoms or

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:10.301
molecules zipping around.
We're not interested in such

00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:13.297
detailed properties.
We want to look at bulk

00:01:13.297 --> 00:01:16.996
macroscopic properties of which
pressure and volume is a

00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:19.670
complete pair.
That's all you need.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.133
I think I reminded you that you
don't need a third axis for

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:28.750
temperature because we have this
equation PV = nRT.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.120
So, if you know P and V,
you don't need temperature as

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.410
another variable.
That's called the equation of

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.620
state.
You can use this all the time.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.088
Whenever the gas has got a
pressure and volume,

00:01:44.088 --> 00:01:48.250
feel free to use PV =
nRT.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.958
Alright, so here's the gas.
And then I want to change its

00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:56.532
state, and I explained to you
that unlike particles whose

00:01:56.532 --> 00:01:59.800
state can change as fast as you
like,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.051
you cannot change the state of
a gas abruptly because if you

00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:04.980
take half the weight off the
top,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.902
the piston will fly off;
there will be a period when the

00:02:07.902 --> 00:02:10.454
gas is not in equilibrium.
Different parts of it will have

00:02:10.454 --> 00:02:12.180
different densities,
different pressure.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.026
You cannot represent that
complicated state as a point in

00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:18.762
this plane.
So, what we want to do is to

00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:22.250
make changes which are slow
enough for us to follow.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.970
So, one way to do that is to
take one grain of sand.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.544
Take one grain of sand,
then you lower the pressure a

00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:32.070
little bit, the piston will move
up a little bit.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.365
Move up means what?
Bigger volume,

00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:37.233
lower pressure,
the gas will come there and

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:41.193
then you can take off another
grain and by making the grain

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:44.421
smaller and smaller,
you can make these dots closer

00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:46.986
and closer.
It's going to take you a long

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:51.170
time but in principle you can
make the gas move on some path.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.663
That is a thermodynamic process.
This process is always near

00:02:57.663 --> 00:03:01.061
equilibrium.
You never deviate too much from

00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:03.909
equilibrium, and it's called a
quasi-static;

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.869
that means not quite static,
but as slow as you like,

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:14.050
and it is called reversible.
Reversible means that you can

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.090
also go right back to where you
came.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.639
If you took a grain out,
piston expands.

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.039
You put the grain back,
piston contracts.

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:27.259
So, you can go down this way or
you can go up this way.

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:30.129
I've just chosen to,
let's say, go down like this.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.687
When that happens,
we want to say the following

00:03:34.687 --> 00:03:39.840
thing about the state of the gas
before and after.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.784
At every point in the PV
diagram, the gas has something

00:03:43.784 --> 00:03:45.660
called the internal energy.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.451
The characteristic of internal
energy is it's called a state

00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:56.552
variable.
And this is a very important

00:03:56.552 --> 00:03:59.093
concept.
A sate variable depends on

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:03.900
where you are in the PV
diagram, what your state is.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.780
It does not depend on the
history;

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.901
it does not depend on all the
things the gas has gone through

00:04:08.901 --> 00:04:11.296
in its life.
If you tell me you are here,

00:04:11.296 --> 00:04:14.807
then we may associate with that
point an energy that doesn't

00:04:14.807 --> 00:04:17.009
look into the history of that
gas.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:21.360
That energy is nothing other
than the kinetic energy.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.637
You'll remember that it's 3/2
kT per atom,

00:04:24.637 --> 00:04:27.710
N atoms,
that's the internal energy.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.970
You can also write this as 3/2
nRT.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.862
If you count the molecules then
use Boltzmann constant,

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:42.130
or you count the number of
moles then use the gas constant.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.291
It's the same thing.
But nRT is PV,

00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:51.180
so if you like,
you can also write it this way.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.290
That shows you very clearly the
internal energy is uniquely

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.919
determined by PV,
and P and V

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.560
determine the product PV.
So, at each point in this

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.160
diagram, the gas is a certain
energy.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.459
But energy is simply that ½
mv^(2) for each molecule.

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:09.560
You add it all up,
that's the total energy.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.800
Okay, so we can write it many
different ways.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.333
Now, the First Law of
Thermodynamics asks the

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:21.514
following question.
If I want to change the energy

00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:25.515
of this gas, how can I do it?
There are two ways to change

00:05:25.515 --> 00:05:27.934
the energy of the gas,
and the total change in

00:05:27.934 --> 00:05:30.268
U,
meaning U at the end

00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:33.894
minus U at the beginning,
where these are two nearby

00:05:33.894 --> 00:05:38.666
points,
is either the heat input minus

00:05:38.666 --> 00:05:47.649
the work done by the gas--Let me
write it as capital PdV.

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:54.170
Sometimes you write it as
∆Q - ∆W.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.468
That's the First Law.
So, you have to take some time

00:05:58.468 --> 00:05:59.700
to understand what it says.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.025
Notice from this formula here,
the energy of an ideal gas,

00:06:06.025 --> 00:06:09.061
and only an ideal gas because
that's the only thing we are

00:06:09.061 --> 00:06:12.402
going to talk about,
is a function only of

00:06:12.402 --> 00:06:15.019
temperature.
If you know the temperature of

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:17.340
the gas, you know the kinetic
energy of the molecule,

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.930
so if the number is constant,
the energy is determined.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.089
The energy depends only on the
temperature for an ideal gas.

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:25.269
So basically,
when I say how can I change the

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:27.647
energy of the gas,
I'm asking how can I raise the

00:06:27.647 --> 00:06:31.649
temperature?
One obvious way is this.

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:35.170
Put it on a hotplate which is
slightly hotter than the gas.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.949
Then the heat will flow from
the hotplate to the gas.

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.029
That's called heating up the
gas.

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:43.769
There you don't see anything
happening, right?

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:45.790
It's occurring at a molecular
level.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.171
The molecules in the hotplate
are, on average,

00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:50.977
moving faster than the
molecules in the gas and during

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:52.920
the collision;
kinetic energy will be

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.810
transferred from the hotplate to
the gas.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.115
That invisible flow people used
to think of as the caloric

00:06:58.115 --> 00:07:01.363
fluid, but now we know it's just
molecular kinetic energy

00:07:01.363 --> 00:07:04.959
transferred from the molecules
in the plate to molecules in the

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:06.910
gas.
That's this guy.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.518
This ∆W,
the plus sign of the W

00:07:10.518 --> 00:07:14.990
is the work done by the gas,
and minus of that is the work

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.119
done on the gas.
And that means if you want to

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:21.506
increase the temperature of the
gas, you're also told you can do

00:07:21.506 --> 00:07:24.110
the following.
Push down on the piston.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.689
If you push down on the piston,
you are reducing the volume.

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:32.047
∆V is negative,
minus P∆V is positive,

00:07:32.047 --> 00:07:35.100
and that'll also increase the
energy of the gas.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.485
Or, if you take a grain of sand
out, and the piston moves

00:07:38.485 --> 00:07:42.172
upwards, the gas works against
the environment and it pays for

00:07:42.172 --> 00:07:45.800
it through its internal energy
because then P∆V will

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.427
be positive and this thing will
be a negative contribution of

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:52.151
the internal energy.
So, there are two ways to

00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:55.740
change the energy of the gas.
One is a way you can actually

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.820
see by moving up and down the
piston.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.892
You can see somebody moving it.
It's a macroscopic motion of

00:08:01.892 --> 00:08:04.615
something you can see.
That's called the work done on

00:08:04.615 --> 00:08:07.203
the gas.
Other one is energy transferred

00:08:07.203 --> 00:08:11.181
at a molecular or microscopic
level, which is what we call

00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:13.767
heat.
And the First Law says the

00:08:13.767 --> 00:08:17.822
total change in the internal
energy is the sum of two

00:08:17.822 --> 00:08:21.775
numbers.
First one is the heat input and

00:08:21.775 --> 00:08:25.070
the second one is the work done.

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:37.294
So, what I did for you last
time was a practice calculation

00:08:37.294 --> 00:08:42.169
in which I took a gas here,
went along an isotherm.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.230
That means temperature is a
constant.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:49.269
That's the meaning of the
isotherm.

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:54.179
And I want to go from some
initial point to some final

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:55.724
point.
So, this volume

00:08:55.724 --> 00:08:58.730
V_1 and
pressure P_1.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.150
This is P_2
and V_2,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.636
and I want to find the work
done by the gas during this

00:09:05.636 --> 00:09:08.083
expansion.
Well, P times

00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:12.405
∆V, you can see,
is really that shaded area here

00:09:12.405 --> 00:09:16.418
because it's a rectangle of
height P and width

00:09:16.418 --> 00:09:20.186
∆V.
So, P∆V is just the

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:23.519
area under the graph that you
follow.

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:26.517
So, the work done,
the sum of all the

00:09:26.517 --> 00:09:30.598
infinitesimal works,
is the pressure as a function

00:09:30.598 --> 00:09:35.344
of volume times dV from
the starting volume for the

00:09:35.344 --> 00:09:38.741
ending volume.
What is P as a function

00:09:38.741 --> 00:09:41.917
of V at a constant
temperature is nRT over

00:09:41.917 --> 00:09:42.610
V?

00:09:46.309 --> 00:09:49.263
Now, I'm using the factor at
every point PV is

00:09:49.263 --> 00:09:52.330
nRT, so P is
nRT over V,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.899
and this is a logarithm and we
all know how to do the integral,

00:09:56.899 --> 00:10:01.100
as log of the upper limit minus
log of the lower limit.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.350
So, that's the first successful
calculation of work done.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.945
You can take the gas on any
path you like,

00:10:07.945 --> 00:10:10.173
you know.
As long as you knew the

00:10:10.173 --> 00:10:12.973
pressure at each volume,
you integrated the function

00:10:12.973 --> 00:10:15.280
from the left limit to the right
limit;

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.047
that's the work done.
For isothermal process,

00:10:18.047 --> 00:10:21.245
it's particularly easy because
the pressure is inversely

00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:24.270
proportional to volume,
and you do that integral.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.178
This is the work done.
For example,

00:10:26.178 --> 00:10:30.447
if the gas expands to double
the volume at temperature 300

00:10:30.447 --> 00:10:34.491
Kelvin, the work done is number
of moles, gas constant,

00:10:34.491 --> 00:10:36.800
300 log of 2.
Multiply all those things;

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.339
that's the work done by the gas.
If that is the work done by the

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:44.730
gas, we can also say the
following.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.490
The internal energy change is
zero.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.110
Right?
That's the trick question I

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.505
told you to watch out for.
If you're going at constant

00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:54.820
temperature, you don't change
the internal energy.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.983
So, if the change in internal
energy is zero,

00:10:58.983 --> 00:11:03.429
it follows at every step,
∆Q = ∆W.

00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:05.960
This quantity we call
∆W.

00:11:09.909 --> 00:11:14.302
Therefore, the work done by the
gas is also equal to the total

00:11:14.302 --> 00:11:18.311
heat input of the gas.
We indicate that by drawing a

00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:21.902
little arrow like this;
it's just the way we like to

00:11:21.902 --> 00:11:24.029
show that heat flows into the
gas.

00:11:24.029 --> 00:11:27.639
Do you understand physically
what's happening?

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:29.866
You take this gas,
you keep it on a reservoir at

00:11:29.866 --> 00:11:32.756
temperature T_1
[T_1 is just

00:11:32.756 --> 00:11:34.909
T].
It's stuck at that temperature.

00:11:34.909 --> 00:11:37.899
If you take a grain of sand,
gas is expanding.

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:41.264
Normally, when the gas expands,
it does work and if energy will

00:11:41.264 --> 00:11:44.192
go down, it'll cool down.
But you're not letting it cool

00:11:44.192 --> 00:11:46.434
down because you're pumping in
heat from below,

00:11:46.434 --> 00:11:48.139
maintaining at that
temperature.

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:52.105
So, this process you should
visualize as a piston with some

00:11:52.105 --> 00:11:54.840
weights sitting on a plate at
temperature

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.178
T_1.
You take off a grain of sand,

00:11:58.178 --> 00:12:01.210
it moves up a little bit but
you don't let it cool down

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.399
because you send in heat from
below,

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:05.200
maintaining it at that
temperature.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.306
For example,
you got this computer air,

00:12:08.306 --> 00:12:10.262
right?
You blow air on your keyboard

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:13.215
to blow off the dust.
You know, when you blow the air

00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:16.341
out, the can cools down.
It cools down because the

00:12:16.341 --> 00:12:19.610
compressed air is working
against the atmosphere as it

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.200
comes out and,
therefore, it loses internal

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.543
energy and it cools down.
That's because you're not

00:12:25.543 --> 00:12:28.649
giving it enough time to absorb
heat from the room.

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:32.380
If you let the air out slow
enough so that in the process of

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:36.110
expansion it tries to cool down
but the room pumps some more

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.978
heat,
then, of course,

00:12:37.978 --> 00:12:40.923
the can will not cool down.
But, you know,

00:12:40.923 --> 00:12:43.090
that's not the purpose of
buying canned air.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.061
You don't want to buy canned
air so you can release it at

00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:47.340
room temperature.
You don't care if it cools down;

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.860
you just want the gas to come
out really fast.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:55.026
So, if you don't allow heat to
come in, an expanding gas will

00:12:55.026 --> 00:12:56.940
cool down.
Okay, that's also why the

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.290
universe cools down.
Process of expansion.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.720
Alright.
So, here's a simple problem

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.520
where you can do many things.
You can find the change in

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.490
energy from start to finish.
Zero.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.704
Work done you find by
integrating PdV and the

00:13:11.704 --> 00:13:15.486
heat input is equal to work done
because there's no change in

00:13:15.486 --> 00:13:18.304
energy.
This is all the stuff I did

00:13:18.304 --> 00:13:20.360
last time.
I also did a couple of other

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.951
topics.
I'll just remind you what they

00:13:21.951 --> 00:13:25.616
are.
I said we can define a specific

00:13:25.616 --> 00:13:28.457
heat for a gas.
Now normally,

00:13:28.457 --> 00:13:33.258
specific heat is the number of
calories to raise one gram or

00:13:33.258 --> 00:13:36.627
one kilogram by one degree.
But for a gas,

00:13:36.627 --> 00:13:40.670
what matters is not the number
of grams but number of moles.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.833
You have already seen it here.
The energy of the gas is not

00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:47.370
proportional to the grams of gas
you have but to the number of

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.269
atoms you have or the number of
moles you have.

00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:55.067
So, we define specific heat to
be the heat needed to produce a

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:58.370
certain temperature change for
one mole.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.293
We take a mole of gas and you
heat the guy and you see how

00:14:06.293 --> 00:14:09.610
many calories do I need to get
an increase of one degree.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:13.080
But that turns out to be
insufficient.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.409
This derivative does not have a
unique value.

00:14:17.409 --> 00:14:24.580
Can someone tell me why it's
not sufficient information?

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.039
You remember from last time?
Yes?

00:14:27.039 --> 00:14:28.677
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:14:28.677 --> 00:14:31.996
Shankar: In other words,
when I take a solid and I say

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:35.830
find the specific heat,
take one gram of solid,

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.927
pump in some heat so the
temperature goes up by one

00:14:37.927 --> 00:14:39.480
degree, keep track of the
calories.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.601
You are done.
For a gas, it turns out if you

00:14:42.601 --> 00:14:46.610
took this gas in the cylinder
and you pump in some calories,

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:50.285
it's going to try to heat up
and when it tries to heat up,

00:14:50.285 --> 00:14:52.938
it may also expand.
When it's expanding,

00:14:52.938 --> 00:14:56.639
then some of the energy that
you pump in the form of heat,

00:14:56.639 --> 00:15:00.340
some of it's turning into work
to push the piston out.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.319
The part that goes through the
internal energy,

00:15:02.319 --> 00:15:04.039
the part that really heats up
the gas,

00:15:04.039 --> 00:15:07.340
is now less because you put in
some heat from below,

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.799
you lose some heat to the
expansion,

00:15:09.799 --> 00:15:11.748
so what goes in to change the
internal energy,

00:15:11.748 --> 00:15:13.610
which is what controlled the
temperature,

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.059
is less than the heat you put
in.

00:15:16.059 --> 00:15:19.179
So, if the gas expands during
the heating process,

00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:22.807
there's a certain energy lost
due to work you have to take

00:15:22.807 --> 00:15:24.768
into account.
On the other hand,

00:15:24.768 --> 00:15:27.745
another person can do the same
experiment of the gas but put a

00:15:27.745 --> 00:15:29.600
pin here so the piston cannot
move.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.750
Then, of course,
it cannot do any work and all

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.110
the heat you put in goes into
internal energy.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.669
That gas will heat up more
readily.

00:15:38.669 --> 00:15:40.973
For a solid,
we don't worry about it because

00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:44.240
the expansion of a solid is such
a tiny fraction of its volume

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.293
when the temperature changes
that the fact that a chunk of

00:15:47.293 --> 00:15:48.894
copper,
when you heat it,

00:15:48.894 --> 00:15:51.553
is also expanding against the
universe, against the

00:15:51.553 --> 00:15:54.850
atmospheric pressure,
is a negligible effect.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.440
The ∆V is so small for
a solid we ignore it.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.815
For a gas it's very important.
Therefore, for a gas there are

00:16:00.815 --> 00:16:03.670
two kinds of specific heat.
In fact, you can define many

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.220
definitions.
The two common ones are

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.980
C_V,
which is ∆Q over

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.694
∆T at constant volume,
and that's how you denote that

00:16:13.694 --> 00:16:14.940
in calculus [pointing to the
equation].

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.579
The other one is
C_P,

00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:21.002
which is ∆Q over
∆T at constant

00:16:21.002 --> 00:16:24.829
pressure.
So, let me derive one more time

00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:30.814
these two specific heats because
it's worth going over this again

00:16:30.814 --> 00:16:35.162
and again.
The key to all of this is the

00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:37.960
First Law.
The First Law,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:43.250
written after transposition,
looks like this.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.870
Let's put ∆Q on one
side and the other stuff on the

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.217
right-hand side.
In the first case,

00:16:48.217 --> 00:16:52.344
at constant volume,
there is no P∆V term

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:56.084
because ∆V is zero.
Therefore,

00:16:56.084 --> 00:17:01.350
∆Q/∆T =
∆U/∆T,

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:05.934
and for one mole,
you remember U is 3/2

00:17:05.934 --> 00:17:09.759
nRT but n is 1,
for one mole.

00:17:09.759 --> 00:17:13.290
So, dU/dT is a simple
derivative of this function with

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.880
respect to T, which is
3/2R.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.559
What do you notice about this
formula?

00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:25.421
It's the specific heat of one
mole of a gas doesn't depend on

00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:28.468
what the gas is.
As long as it's a monoatomic

00:17:28.468 --> 00:17:31.569
gas, it doesn't matter what the
mono atom is.

00:17:31.569 --> 00:17:33.020
It could be hydrogen,
it could be helium;

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.634
it doesn't matter.
That's why we like to think

00:17:35.634 --> 00:17:39.150
about the molar-specific heat or
specific heat per mole.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.269
You get an answer that's
universal.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:44.249
If you took specific heat for a
gram, then one gram of hydrogen

00:17:44.249 --> 00:17:46.892
and one gram of helium won't
have the same specific heat

00:17:46.892 --> 00:17:49.440
because they don't have the same
number of atoms.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.326
But if you count in moles,
the beauty of the formula is

00:17:53.326 --> 00:17:56.349
this number is true for all
ideal gases,

00:17:56.349 --> 00:17:58.904
whereas if you took the
specific heat of copper or

00:17:58.904 --> 00:18:01.042
silver or iron,
it varies from material to

00:18:01.042 --> 00:18:03.262
material.
Specific heat of ideal gases is

00:18:03.262 --> 00:18:05.252
very simple.
You don't need to look at a

00:18:05.252 --> 00:18:07.712
table.
Here's the answer for all ideal

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:09.846
gases.
It's very important it's a

00:18:09.846 --> 00:18:12.457
monoatomic gas,
which is a point-like atom

00:18:12.457 --> 00:18:16.152
which only moves but doesn't
have any internal structure so

00:18:16.152 --> 00:18:18.700
it can spin and rotate and
vibrate.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.312
If it can do that,
there are other contributions

00:18:21.312 --> 00:18:23.480
to energy, but we're not going
there.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.019
Now, let's calculate
C_P.

00:18:27.019 --> 00:18:30.471
C_P is
∆Q over ∆T at

00:18:30.471 --> 00:18:33.641
constant pressure.
So now, you cannot ignore this

00:18:33.641 --> 00:18:35.541
term.
So, ∆U,

00:18:35.541 --> 00:18:40.390
from what I did before,
will be C_v

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:44.860
times ∆T,
plus there is a new term.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:53.661
P∆V is ∆ of
PV because P is

00:18:53.661 --> 00:18:55.950
constant.
If P is a constant,

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.075
the change in PV is the
same as P times change in

00:18:59.075 --> 00:19:01.343
V.
But PV = RT,

00:19:01.343 --> 00:19:06.420
so if C_v
∆T plus R∆T.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.300
If you divide every side by
∆T and take ∆Q

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.505
over ∆T,
then C_P will

00:19:13.505 --> 00:19:17.026
be C_v plus
R and that's a very

00:19:17.026 --> 00:19:20.274
famous formula.
And you should understand why

00:19:20.274 --> 00:19:24.208
specific heat at constant
pressure is more than specific

00:19:24.208 --> 00:19:27.700
heat at constant volume.
Think about that.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.235
If the gas is stuck at a given
volume, it's easier to heat it

00:19:31.235 --> 00:19:34.299
up because all the heat goes
into internal energy.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:38.237
If it is at constant pressure,
you're letting the piston move

00:19:38.237 --> 00:19:42.109
up and some of the heat is being
paid to move the piston,

00:19:42.109 --> 00:19:44.589
only the rest is going to
change the internal energy.

00:19:44.589 --> 00:19:46.401
That's why C_P
is always bigger than

00:19:46.401 --> 00:19:47.970
C_v,
and for an ideal gas,

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.877
C_P is
C_v plus

00:19:49.877 --> 00:19:52.093
R and this number,
γ, is defined as

00:19:52.093 --> 00:19:54.380
C_P over
C_v.

00:19:58.079 --> 00:20:00.206
This is always the definition
of γ,

00:20:00.206 --> 00:20:02.079
where there is an ideal gas or
not.

00:20:02.079 --> 00:20:03.472
For an ideal gas,
we can calculate

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:05.539
C_p over
C_v,

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:09.240
which is 3/2 R plus
another R,

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.200
divided by 3 /2 R,
which is 5 over 3.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:19.069
So, γ is not always 5 over 3.
You should be aware of that.

00:20:19.069 --> 00:20:21.799
But for ideal gas,
γ is 5 over 3.

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:24.666
So, this is a review of what I
did last time,

00:20:24.666 --> 00:20:28.314
but I'm very eager that you
guys should be on top of this

00:20:28.314 --> 00:20:31.049
and it's worth doing it one more
time.

00:20:31.049 --> 00:20:36.546
But now, I'm going to consider
some more processes where I want

00:20:36.546 --> 00:20:38.320
to find work done.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.050
So, maybe I'll start fresh here.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.450
Let's take the following
process.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.550
I start here.
I go on an isothermal here

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.514
[pointing at graph],
then I go backwards at constant

00:21:00.514 --> 00:21:05.178
pressure until I'm right below
this point, then I go straight

00:21:05.178 --> 00:21:05.800
up.

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:11.727
You can ask,
"What is the work done in this

00:21:11.727 --> 00:21:12.240
process?"

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.750
The work done in the curvy part
of it is all of this.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:26.740
That's in the part AB.
In the part BC,

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.302
work done is the area of this
rectangle but it's counted as

00:21:31.302 --> 00:21:35.000
negative, because a gas is being
compressed.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.189
Or, if you like,
it's at some constant pressure

00:21:37.189 --> 00:21:39.759
but the change in volume is
negative for every step.

00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:42.676
So, even though the work done
is said to be the area,

00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:44.640
you've got to keep track of
sign.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.829
If you're compressing the gas,
P∆V is negative.

00:21:47.829 --> 00:21:52.047
Therefore, in the part
BC, we must take away the

00:21:52.047 --> 00:21:56.577
shaded region and CA,
no work is done because volume

00:21:56.577 --> 00:22:00.444
is not changing.
Area under the vertical line is

00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:02.680
zero.
So, you can see that in this

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.390
full cycle, when I go from
A to B to C

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.687
back to A,
the work done is the area

00:22:09.687 --> 00:22:13.320
enclosed by the loop in the
PV plane.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:22.786
That's a very useful result.
We say the work done in a

00:22:22.786 --> 00:22:27.069
cycle, there's a symbol we like
to use.

00:22:27.069 --> 00:22:29.937
This curly thing on the
integral means taken around a

00:22:29.937 --> 00:22:30.710
closed loop.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:38.138
But you guys have to be little
careful when you write this,

00:22:38.138 --> 00:22:41.446
because somebody else can do
the following thing to gas,

00:22:41.446 --> 00:22:44.233
do exactly the opposite.
Come down like this,

00:22:44.233 --> 00:22:46.550
go down like this,
and go down like that.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:51.390
Go up like that.
The opposite way.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.618
In this case,
the work done is considered

00:22:54.618 --> 00:22:58.250
positive because the part of it,
AB,

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.991
is taller than the BC at
point Y,

00:23:00.991 --> 00:23:04.134
so the net work is positive.
Here, it's the same amount of

00:23:04.134 --> 00:23:05.769
work but the net work is
negative.

00:23:05.769 --> 00:23:10.933
So, you've got to be careful
that you describe the sense in

00:23:10.933 --> 00:23:14.114
which you do the loop.
So, the same loop,

00:23:14.114 --> 00:23:16.493
as a geometrical figure,
as the same area,

00:23:16.493 --> 00:23:19.743
but the work done by the gas is
positive in this case and

00:23:19.743 --> 00:23:22.837
negative in this case,
and you can use common sense to

00:23:22.837 --> 00:23:24.759
find out if it's positive or
negative.

00:23:24.759 --> 00:23:29.250
But here is another very
interesting result.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:34.030
Let's go to the full cycle and
ask, "What's the change in U?"

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:43.686
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:23:43.686 --> 00:23:47.789
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:50.170
His answer was PV is the
same.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.158
And more generally,
even if it's not an ideal gas,

00:23:53.158 --> 00:23:55.720
it's a gas made up of whatever
you like.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.844
It's any system.
If you return the system back

00:23:58.844 --> 00:24:02.510
to the same state,
the internal energy returns to

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.110
that value.
That's what I meant by internal

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.529
energy doesn't depend on the
history of the gas.

00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:09.555
For example,
you can take the cylinder,

00:24:09.555 --> 00:24:11.687
you leave it alone,
I measure the energy,

00:24:11.687 --> 00:24:13.819
I go outside the room and come
back.

00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:16.328
In the meantime,
you took it on a loop and

00:24:16.328 --> 00:24:18.364
brought it back.
I will not know,

00:24:18.364 --> 00:24:21.167
and I don't care because as far
as I'm concerned,

00:24:21.167 --> 00:24:24.380
if P and V are
back to where they are;

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.339
the gas is back to where it is;
energy is back to where it is.

00:24:27.339 --> 00:24:29.819
So, the change in the internal
energy is zero.

00:24:29.819 --> 00:24:34.190
That means the work done and
the heat input are the same.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.851
So, let's be very clear.
If you guys do problems,

00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:40.460
I don't want you to lose points
for sign mistake.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.865
W is always the work
done and Q is always the

00:24:43.865 --> 00:24:45.040
heat into the gas.

00:24:50.259 --> 00:24:54.710
So, this is a gas here which
has done some work and some heat

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:59.284
that's been put into the gas,
and the two have to be equal

00:24:59.284 --> 00:25:03.019
because the energy doesn't
change in the end.

00:25:03.019 --> 00:25:06.851
Now, that leads to a very,
very subtle and interesting

00:25:06.851 --> 00:25:09.884
point.
There is a very clear notion of

00:25:09.884 --> 00:25:13.680
what is the energy in the gas.
There's a unique answer.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.319
There's no notion of what is
the heat in the gas.

00:25:16.319 --> 00:25:18.841
You look at a gas and you
cannot say this is the heat in

00:25:18.841 --> 00:25:20.390
the gas.
That makes no sense.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:25.148
Try to understand why.
Because if you say there's some

00:25:25.148 --> 00:25:28.065
amount of heat in the gas,
okay, whatever you want,

00:25:28.065 --> 00:25:30.515
some number,
I do the cycle and I come back

00:25:30.515 --> 00:25:33.526
to exactly where I am.
I'll put in some amount of heat

00:25:33.526 --> 00:25:36.898
Q, which is non-zero.
So, if there's anything called

00:25:36.898 --> 00:25:40.278
the heat in the gas,
it has changed by an amount of

00:25:40.278 --> 00:25:42.982
Q.
That's why there's no notion of

00:25:42.982 --> 00:25:45.180
heat in the gas or work in the
gas.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:49.196
There's only energy in the gas.
A state variable returns to its

00:25:49.196 --> 00:25:51.992
original value and when you go
on closed loop,

00:25:51.992 --> 00:25:54.230
the change should add up to
zero.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.024
That's not true for work,
that's not true for heat,

00:25:57.024 --> 00:25:58.980
but it's true for the
difference.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.410
That defines an internal state
variable.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:07.548
Okay, now I'm going to consider
a new process which is of

00:26:07.548 --> 00:26:11.510
special importance.
So, the processes I've

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:15.509
considered so far are
isothermal, at constant pressure

00:26:15.509 --> 00:26:19.328
is called isobaric,
and I don't know the name for

00:26:19.328 --> 00:26:22.825
constant volume,
but no work is done at constant

00:26:22.825 --> 00:26:26.057
volume.
Now, I'm going to consider the

00:26:26.057 --> 00:26:28.960
last process very,
very important.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.030
It's called adiabatic.

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:38.119
Adiabatic process is in which
the gas changes its volume but

00:26:38.119 --> 00:26:42.314
it's completely thermally
isolated, so ∆Q is

00:26:42.314 --> 00:26:44.747
zero.
You wrap this guy in a blanket

00:26:44.747 --> 00:26:47.988
and you do things to it.
No heat can flow into the gas

00:26:47.988 --> 00:26:50.933
or out of the gas.
That's called an adiabatic

00:26:50.933 --> 00:26:53.769
process.
Isothermal is quite different.

00:26:53.769 --> 00:26:57.048
Isothermal, you keep it on a
hotplate at a given temperature

00:26:57.048 --> 00:27:00.048
and as the volume changes,
say as the volume increases,

00:27:00.048 --> 00:27:03.244
heat comes in from below.
Or, when you compress it and

00:27:03.244 --> 00:27:06.300
you don't want it to heat up,
heat is rejected below.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.567
But this is not the case here.
In an adiabatic process,

00:27:09.567 --> 00:27:12.555
if you let the gas expand you
thermally isolate it from

00:27:12.555 --> 00:27:15.142
everything.
So, you should think about

00:27:15.142 --> 00:27:18.000
what'll happen to a gas if I
start here.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.670
That's what isothermal is.
What do you think will happen?

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.275
So, let's draw a few isotherms.
This is temperature,

00:27:25.275 --> 00:27:26.640
say T = 300.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:37.430
This is T equal to what?
More than 300 or less than 300?

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:38.870
Student: Less.
Professor Ramamurti

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.570
Shankar: Less.
And why do I say less?

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.924
You take any point here;
it's got the same volume but

00:27:43.924 --> 00:27:46.823
lower pressure,
so P times V is

00:27:46.823 --> 00:27:49.750
less.
So, this may be T = 200.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:54.042
If I start here,
now I let the gas expand

00:27:54.042 --> 00:27:57.389
adiabatically.
That means I pull out the

00:27:57.389 --> 00:28:00.126
grains of sand,
the gas expands against the

00:28:00.126 --> 00:28:03.320
atmosphere, but no heat is
allowed to come in.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.630
Think about what that means.
Gas is pushing the piston.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:10.094
Gas is doing some work.
It'll pay for it through its

00:28:10.094 --> 00:28:14.755
own internal energy.
Internal energy will go down

00:28:14.755 --> 00:28:19.829
and that means temperature will
go down.

00:28:19.829 --> 00:28:23.524
So, what you will be doing is
you'll be cascading down from

00:28:23.524 --> 00:28:27.343
one isotherm to another,
plummeting down in temperature

00:28:27.343 --> 00:28:30.588
until you come and stop
somewhere at the lower

00:28:30.588 --> 00:28:33.368
temperature.
So, an adiabatic process will

00:28:33.368 --> 00:28:36.824
cross from one isotherm to the
next to the next to the next,

00:28:36.824 --> 00:28:38.230
changing temperature.

00:28:41.529 --> 00:28:45.344
Another way to say this is that
the drop in pressure for a given

00:28:45.344 --> 00:28:48.607
drop in increase in volume,
it would be more precipitous

00:28:48.607 --> 00:28:51.675
for adiabatic because it's
expanding but there's no energy

00:28:51.675 --> 00:28:54.367
coming into the form of heat so
pressure drops more

00:28:54.367 --> 00:28:57.250
precipitously.
So, it won't be PV equal

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:00.130
to constant, and the question
is, "What is it?"

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.890
What is the equation for an
adiabatic process?

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:07.680
What is P as the
function of V?

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.240
That's what we want to ask now.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:18.117
So, whenever you have any such
question in thermodynamics,

00:29:18.117 --> 00:29:21.464
up to this point the only law
we know is the First Law of

00:29:21.464 --> 00:29:24.579
Thermodynamics.
So, you have to go back to that.

00:29:24.579 --> 00:29:29.559
So far, I've driven home the
point that every question asked

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:33.780
in mechanics can be traced back
to Newton's Law.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.251
There are no new laws.
But when you come to

00:29:36.251 --> 00:29:38.486
thermodynamics and you study
heat and temperature,

00:29:38.486 --> 00:29:41.039
there is new stuff and the
First Law of Thermodynamics is

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:43.710
called a law,
because there is no way you can

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:46.630
derive it from Newtonian laws.
It's a new concept.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:51.096
So, let's ask what is P
as a function of V,

00:29:51.096 --> 00:29:55.842
given that ∆Q = 0?
So, what's our strategy going

00:29:55.842 --> 00:29:58.010
to be?
How would you even begin this?

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.480
Do you have some idea of what
you might do?

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.074
This is a tough question so
even if you give a wrong answer,

00:30:08.074 --> 00:30:10.863
that's fine.
How do I calculate the relation

00:30:10.863 --> 00:30:14.510
of P to V given
that ∆Q = 0?

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:24.955
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:30:24.955 --> 00:30:38.309
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay.

00:30:38.309 --> 00:30:41.170
Let me write down everything he
said.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:46.585
When I said ∆Q = 0,
your first reaction has to go

00:30:46.585 --> 00:30:51.809
back to the First Law and write
∆Q as ∆U +

00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:54.290
P∆V,
and set that equal to zero.

00:30:59.019 --> 00:31:03.099
But ∆U is
C_v times

00:31:03.099 --> 00:31:06.900
∆T, plus P∆V
is zero.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:14.273
By the way, ∆U is
C_v ∆T for

00:31:14.273 --> 00:31:16.768
one mole.
I'm going to consider one mole

00:31:16.768 --> 00:31:19.471
of gas.
Now, this is another thing you

00:31:19.471 --> 00:31:22.932
people should understand.
The way in which pressure falls

00:31:22.932 --> 00:31:26.037
for temperature is going to be
the same, whether I consider one

00:31:26.037 --> 00:31:29.371
mole or two moles or ten moles.
The rate at which it changes

00:31:29.371 --> 00:31:32.052
will not be dependent on how
many moles I took,

00:31:32.052 --> 00:31:35.082
so if you want you can take
n moles and put an

00:31:35.082 --> 00:31:37.460
n here.
You'll find everywhere an

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.240
n will come and cancel
out.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:47.619
Now, P is nRT
over V.

00:31:47.619 --> 00:31:50.319
So, maybe I'll do it this way
for you guys.

00:31:50.319 --> 00:31:52.255
If you want,
put an n back there,

00:31:52.255 --> 00:31:54.934
but you will find n
cancels part of the equation

00:31:54.934 --> 00:31:56.869
because nC_v
∆T,

00:31:56.869 --> 00:32:03.779
plus nRT ∆V over
V equals zero;

00:32:03.779 --> 00:32:06.349
so the answer doesn't depend on
how many moles you took.

00:32:06.349 --> 00:32:11.040
So, I will take one mole for my
calculation.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:20.240
Think about what this says.
Divide everything by T.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:25.496
You get C_v
over R∆T over T

00:32:25.496 --> 00:32:29.150
plus ∆V over V
is zero.

00:32:34.859 --> 00:32:39.193
This is telling you that as you
change your volume and you're

00:32:39.193 --> 00:32:42.660
coming down this graph of
adiabatic expansion,

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.702
when you go from there to
there, there's a change in

00:32:45.702 --> 00:32:48.865
temperature such that the change
in temperature by the

00:32:48.865 --> 00:32:51.207
temperature,
plus the change in volume

00:32:51.207 --> 00:32:53.759
divided by the volume,
should add up to zero.

00:32:53.759 --> 00:32:56.049
That is a condition of no heat
flow.

00:32:56.049 --> 00:32:59.790
So, it relates a change in
T to a change in

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.829
V.
What I would have ideally liked

00:33:02.829 --> 00:33:06.589
is a change in P due to a
change in V,

00:33:06.589 --> 00:33:09.672
but what comes more naturally
is a change in T over a

00:33:09.672 --> 00:33:12.458
change in V.
But let's worry about that

00:33:12.458 --> 00:33:15.119
later, because we've got PV =
RT.

00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:18.165
We can always swap the
temperature for pressure in the

00:33:18.165 --> 00:33:19.983
end.
So, let's just take this

00:33:19.983 --> 00:33:21.792
definition.
So, every change,

00:33:21.792 --> 00:33:24.505
remember now,
you understand you go from one

00:33:24.505 --> 00:33:28.119
point to the neighboring point;
there's a plunge in temperature.

00:33:28.119 --> 00:33:31.549
That's why ∆T will be
negative and ∆ will be

00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:34.530
positive and these numbers will,
of course, cancel.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:38.443
Now, let's add all the changes.
Let's call it doing the

00:33:38.443 --> 00:33:40.735
integral.
Do the integral of that from

00:33:40.735 --> 00:33:42.975
start to finish,
do the integral of that from

00:33:42.975 --> 00:33:45.216
start to finish,
and that integral of zero is

00:33:45.216 --> 00:33:45.980
just zero.

00:33:49.529 --> 00:33:52.325
So, this tells me
C_v over

00:33:52.325 --> 00:33:55.386
R times log of
T_2 over

00:33:55.386 --> 00:33:57.795
T_1,
plus log of

00:33:57.795 --> 00:34:01.590
V_2 over
V_1 is zero.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:11.478
Now, you've got to go back and
think about your logarithms and

00:34:11.478 --> 00:34:15.277
realize--and I can write it as
log of T_2 over

00:34:15.277 --> 00:34:18.954
T_1 raised to
the power C_v

00:34:18.954 --> 00:34:22.784
over R,
times V_2 over

00:34:22.784 --> 00:34:26.059
V_1 is equal to
zero.

00:34:26.059 --> 00:34:29.202
We just combine all the
logarithms and realize the log

00:34:29.202 --> 00:34:32.049
of X to the power
n is n log

00:34:32.049 --> 00:34:34.780
X.
So, that is the same as this.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.909
Now, the log of something is
zero means that something is 1,

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:42.945
because log of 1 is zero.
So, we rewrite the final

00:34:42.945 --> 00:34:48.310
expression I got up there by
saying T_2 over

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:53.227
T_1 raised to
C_v over

00:34:53.227 --> 00:34:56.714
R times
V_2 over

00:34:56.714 --> 00:35:00.470
V_1 is equal to
1.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.280
And we usually write it as
follows.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.778
We say T_2
raised to the

00:35:09.778 --> 00:35:12.090
C_v over
R,

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:14.085
V_2 to the
power of 1 is

00:35:14.085 --> 00:35:16.980
T_1 raised to
the C_v.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:22.170
I'm sorry, T_1
raised to C_v

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.829
over R times
V_1.

00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:29.405
So, this is the relation
between the temperature and the

00:35:29.405 --> 00:35:30.760
volume.
Yes?

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.723
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:35:33.723 --> 00:35:36.510
Shankar: You could do that.
That's correct.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.320
You could write down
three-halves if you like.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.949
At the moment,
I'm trying to keep it general.

00:35:40.949 --> 00:35:43.773
If it was a gas for which
C_v was not

00:35:43.773 --> 00:35:46.330
three-halves R,
all of this would still be

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:47.880
true.
But he is quite right.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.913
For an ideal monoatomic gas,
C_v over

00:35:50.913 --> 00:35:55.171
R would be just 3 over 2.
So, what it's telling you is

00:35:55.171 --> 00:35:59.300
that when the gas expands,
the temperature falls.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.219
I already told you that.
It's telling exactly how it

00:36:03.219 --> 00:36:05.513
falls.
It tells you that T to

00:36:05.513 --> 00:36:08.743
some strange power times
V is constant during the

00:36:08.743 --> 00:36:11.003
process.
Now, if you want to know what

00:36:11.003 --> 00:36:13.840
happens to the pressure,
you can do the following.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.450
You remember PV = RT.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:29.800
There are many ways to write
this.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.250
I'm going to write it in
another way and you guys see if

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.269
you can follow this.
T_2V

00:36:34.269 --> 00:36:36.836
_2 to the power
R over

00:36:36.836 --> 00:36:39.831
C_v is equal to
T_1V

00:36:39.831 --> 00:36:42.398
_1 to the power
R over

00:36:42.398 --> 00:36:45.380
C_v.
You believe that?

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.710
That's just a mathematical
trick.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:51.724
If that is true, this is true.
You know how I went from here

00:36:51.724 --> 00:36:52.210
to here?

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.139
How did I go from here to here?
Do you have an idea?

00:36:58.139 --> 00:36:59.768
Student: You take
R over

00:36:59.768 --> 00:37:01.837
C_v to the
power of [inaudible]

00:37:01.837 --> 00:37:03.949
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Exactly.

00:37:03.949 --> 00:37:06.528
Raise both sides to the power
R over

00:37:06.528 --> 00:37:08.866
C_v.
It's cooked up so that

00:37:08.866 --> 00:37:11.225
C_v over
R goes away and R

00:37:11.225 --> 00:37:13.710
over C_v falls
on V_2.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.820
There is another way to write
it, if you like.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.219
I'll tell you why I write it
this way.

00:37:18.219 --> 00:37:23.306
Because T_2 is
just P_2V

00:37:23.306 --> 00:37:26.516
_2.
But let me combine that one

00:37:26.516 --> 00:37:29.650
V_2 with this
and write the one plus R

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.162
over C_v.
Then, I can show it as

00:37:32.162 --> 00:37:34.392
P_1V
_1 to the power 1

00:37:34.392 --> 00:37:36.390
plus R over
C_v.

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:43.057
You may object that PV
is not T but is

00:37:43.057 --> 00:37:46.444
RT, but R will
cancel so I didn't bother with

00:37:46.444 --> 00:37:49.216
that.
And this--don't draw the box

00:37:49.216 --> 00:37:51.925
around this yet.
I will write it in a way that's

00:37:51.925 --> 00:37:54.442
very, very standard and if you
remember in your high school

00:37:54.442 --> 00:37:56.398
days,
you may remember is written as

00:37:56.398 --> 00:37:58.543
P_2V
_2 to the

00:37:58.543 --> 00:38:01.218
γ,
is equal to P_1V

00:38:01.218 --> 00:38:04.970
_1 to the
γ, but γ is just

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.039
1 plus R over
C_v,

00:38:08.039 --> 00:38:11.701
which you can see is equal to
C_v plus

00:38:11.701 --> 00:38:14.752
R over
C_v and that is

00:38:14.752 --> 00:38:18.210
C_P over
C_v.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:19.702
So, this γ is really
C_P over

00:38:19.702 --> 00:38:21.583
C_v.
For an adiabatic process,

00:38:21.583 --> 00:38:23.556
P_2V
_2 to the

00:38:23.556 --> 00:38:26.170
γ is P_1V
_1 to the

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.286
γ.
That's one way to write it,

00:38:28.286 --> 00:38:31.343
but I will also expect you to
know that you can also write it

00:38:31.343 --> 00:38:34.795
in terms of temperature,
as temperature times volume

00:38:34.795 --> 00:38:38.640
raised to a strange power is
equal to a constant,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.320
before and after.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:50.322
Any questions?
So, what we have done is found

00:38:50.322 --> 00:38:55.800
pressure as the function of
volume on an adiabatic curve.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.390
So, I'm now going to do one
last ingredient for the rest of

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.239
the stuff, which is the
following.

00:39:03.239 --> 00:39:08.191
I'm going to calculate the work
done in an adiabatic process

00:39:08.191 --> 00:39:11.889
from here to here.
This is one, this is two.

00:39:11.889 --> 00:39:14.296
This is not an isothermal,
which looks like that,

00:39:14.296 --> 00:39:17.030
it's an adiabatic process.
What's the work done in

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.800
adiabatic process?
So, let's calculate that.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:29.820
Work done is equal to integral
P(v)dV.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.539
But remember,
PV to the γ is a

00:39:33.539 --> 00:39:35.676
constant.
Do you guys understand the

00:39:35.676 --> 00:39:38.739
relation of writing PV to
the γ equal to constant?

00:39:38.739 --> 00:39:40.352
It's the same as saying
P_1V

00:39:40.352 --> 00:39:42.488
_1 to the
γ is P_2V

00:39:42.488 --> 00:39:44.019
_2 to the
γ.

00:39:44.019 --> 00:39:46.990
That means you can pick any
point on the path and P

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:49.961
at that point times V at
that point to the power of

00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:51.890
γ will be a fixed
number.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.776
That number is C.
In other words,

00:39:54.776 --> 00:39:56.666
this C can be
P_1V

00:39:56.666 --> 00:39:59.170
_1 to the
γ if you like,

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:00.748
or P_2V
_2 to the

00:40:00.748 --> 00:40:02.253
γ if you like or
P_3V

00:40:02.253 --> 00:40:04.272
_3 to the
γ if 3 is another

00:40:04.272 --> 00:40:07.729
point on this trajectory.
It's convenient to call that

00:40:07.729 --> 00:40:13.030
invariant product of PV
raised to γ as C.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:16.592
Because then we can do the
integral as dV over

00:40:16.592 --> 00:40:20.633
V to the γ with a
constant C here from

00:40:20.633 --> 00:40:23.990
V_1 to
V_2.

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:30.980
And this is a pretty simple
integral.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.284
You guys know that the x
to the n integral is

00:40:33.284 --> 00:40:35.469
x to the n plus 1
over n plus 1,

00:40:35.469 --> 00:40:38.758
such that V to the
γ minus 1,

00:40:38.758 --> 00:40:40.670
over γ minus 1.

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:51.890
Because this is really V
to the minus γ.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:54.930
Now, did I get it wrong here?
I think I got it wrong.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:58.246
Sorry.
It's 1 minus γ,

00:40:58.246 --> 00:41:02.969
1 minus γ,
over 1 minus γ.

00:41:02.969 --> 00:41:06.613
Because V to the minus
γ dV,

00:41:06.613 --> 00:41:11.297
is equal to V to the
minus γ plus 1 over

00:41:11.297 --> 00:41:14.940
minus γ plus 1.
Right?

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.505
x to the n
integral is X to the

00:41:17.505 --> 00:41:20.472
n plus 1 over n
plus 1, n happens to be

00:41:20.472 --> 00:41:24.449
minus γ here.
Okay, now watch this.

00:41:24.449 --> 00:41:29.193
This constant I said can be
written as any of these numbers,

00:41:29.193 --> 00:41:32.650
but let me write when it
multiplies this;

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.000
let me write as
P_2V

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.519
_2 to the
γ.

00:41:35.519 --> 00:41:37.350
Can you see what happens if I
do that?

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:41.019
Try to do this in your head.
C multiplies all of this.

00:41:41.019 --> 00:41:43.807
When C multiplies this
guy, let me write the constant

00:41:43.807 --> 00:41:45.838
as P_2V
_2 to the

00:41:45.838 --> 00:41:47.128
γ;
that gives me a

00:41:47.128 --> 00:41:49.138
P_2
,V_2 to the

00:41:49.138 --> 00:41:51.400
γ combines with
V_2 to the one

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.074
minus γ,
to give me just

00:41:53.074 --> 00:41:56.557
V_2.
Likewise, C multiplying

00:41:56.557 --> 00:42:00.420
this one, when the same C
multiplies this,

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.841
let's write C as
P_1V

00:42:01.841 --> 00:42:03.120
_1 to the
γ,

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.250
and we'll find there's that.

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.632
And people like to rewrite this
by changing the sign everywhere

00:42:12.632 --> 00:42:15.017
as P_1V
_1 minus

00:42:15.017 --> 00:42:17.744
P_2V
_2 over γ

00:42:17.744 --> 00:42:20.115
minus 1,
because γ minus 1 is

00:42:20.115 --> 00:42:23.319
the positive quantity.
So, this is the work done in an

00:42:23.319 --> 00:42:24.490
adiabatic process.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.650
So, what's been going on?
Let's think about what I've

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:38.425
been doing.
I told you that there is a new

00:42:38.425 --> 00:42:42.250
process called adiabatic,
a really important process,

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:44.897
in which the system is not
allowed to exchange heat with

00:42:44.897 --> 00:42:48.416
the outside world.
∆Q = 0 is a condition

00:42:48.416 --> 00:42:51.739
relating ∆U and
P∆V.

00:42:51.739 --> 00:42:55.639
And the changes are correlated
and the effect of adding up all

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:58.260
the changes, namely doing the
integral,

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.286
is this one,
namely temperature to the

00:43:00.286 --> 00:43:02.422
C_v over
R times

00:43:02.422 --> 00:43:05.489
V_2 does not
change along the path.

00:43:05.489 --> 00:43:08.927
So, if you take any two points,
that combination of temperature

00:43:08.927 --> 00:43:12.067
and volume doesn't change.
Then, since PV equal to

00:43:12.067 --> 00:43:14.448
essentially T,
you can also write it as

00:43:14.448 --> 00:43:17.305
pressure times volume to the
power of γ doesn't

00:43:17.305 --> 00:43:19.864
change.
So, I'm saying you can call all

00:43:19.864 --> 00:43:22.409
of that equal to some constant
C.

00:43:22.409 --> 00:43:24.611
The C is not a universal
constant, like velocity of

00:43:24.611 --> 00:43:26.128
light.
For a given gas,

00:43:26.128 --> 00:43:29.979
on a given experiment,
it does not change as it goes

00:43:29.979 --> 00:43:33.648
through adiabatic expansion.
So, don't think of it as a

00:43:33.648 --> 00:43:35.801
universal constant.
On the trajectory,

00:43:35.801 --> 00:43:38.380
on the adiabatic curve,
it's a constant.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.464
It's like saying kinetic energy
plus potential energy is a

00:43:41.464 --> 00:43:43.897
constant.
It's not a constant you can

00:43:43.897 --> 00:43:46.120
look up in a book.
It depends on what your

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.672
particle is doing.
But for that particle in those

00:43:48.672 --> 00:43:51.879
conditions, kinetic with
potential adds to a particular

00:43:51.879 --> 00:43:55.264
constant we call total energy.
Likewise, PV to the

00:43:55.264 --> 00:43:57.949
γ is a constant for this
particular gas.

00:43:57.949 --> 00:44:06.250
Okay, so all this is actually a
preparation for something else.

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:09.989
And that's what we are going to
discuss now.

00:44:09.989 --> 00:44:14.960
So, between now and the end of
this course we are going to

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.710
discuss the Second Law of
Thermodynamics.

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:25.730
So, we have done all we want to
do with the First Law.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:30.168
So, you guys should be able to
be given various graphs on the

00:44:30.168 --> 00:44:33.035
PV plane,
find the work done in going

00:44:33.035 --> 00:44:35.651
from here to there,
find the change in internal

00:44:35.651 --> 00:44:39.059
energy,
find the heat added and so on.

00:44:39.059 --> 00:44:41.639
I hope you can do such
problems, but they're all going

00:44:41.639 --> 00:44:44.343
to be one of these formulas.
Say there's going to be

00:44:44.343 --> 00:44:47.369
adiabatic or constant pressure
or constant temperature,

00:44:47.369 --> 00:44:50.747
so you just plug the numbers
in, keep track of the signs by

00:44:50.747 --> 00:44:53.369
using common sense.
Alright.

00:44:53.369 --> 00:44:56.271
So now, we come to the last
part of thermodynamics,

00:44:56.271 --> 00:44:59.057
which is to me one of the most
beautiful parts of

00:44:59.057 --> 00:45:02.976
thermodynamics,
which starts out with asking

00:45:02.976 --> 00:45:07.262
the following question.
There are certain things in

00:45:07.262 --> 00:45:11.006
this world that are perfectly
allowed but don't seem to

00:45:11.006 --> 00:45:15.490
happen.
Let's take many examples.

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:18.493
Take the Joule experiment.
You take a cylinder of water

00:45:18.493 --> 00:45:21.833
with a paddle that can spin and
you put some weight around the

00:45:21.833 --> 00:45:25.270
pulley and the weight goes down.
Paddle spins;

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:28.862
the water heats up.
You take a movie of that,

00:45:28.862 --> 00:45:33.550
and the movie is so fine it can
even catch individual molecules.

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:38.530
Now, you play the movie
backwards.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:41.623
So, you watch the movie being
played back and what do you

00:45:41.623 --> 00:45:44.128
find?
Suddenly, the weight starts

00:45:44.128 --> 00:45:48.602
moving up, paddle spins the
other way, and the water cools

00:45:48.602 --> 00:45:51.264
down.
This is not in violation of any

00:45:51.264 --> 00:45:54.808
of the laws you have learned
including the First Law of

00:45:54.808 --> 00:45:58.717
Thermodynamics,
because when the weight went

00:45:58.717 --> 00:46:04.563
down and the water heated up,
some amount of work was done on

00:46:04.563 --> 00:46:07.622
the water,
and the energy of the water

00:46:07.622 --> 00:46:09.579
went up.
In the reverse process,

00:46:09.579 --> 00:46:13.124
the energy of the water went
down and instead the weight went

00:46:13.124 --> 00:46:15.370
up, so work was done by the
system.

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:20.735
But that doesn't seem to happen.
If the weight comes down you

00:46:20.735 --> 00:46:23.138
can wait all day.
Well, let me give you another

00:46:23.138 --> 00:46:24.936
example.
Take a chunk of wood,

00:46:24.936 --> 00:46:28.550
you slide it there.
Sorry.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:32.179
It was not a piece of wood and
it didn't stop.

00:46:32.179 --> 00:46:35.665
See, this is why I don't do
demonstrations because even the

00:46:35.665 --> 00:46:38.670
simplest demonstration I have
done doesn't work.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.550
So, that's why some of us
become theoretical physicists.

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:45.129
I did a demonstration where
some trolley is supposed to

00:46:45.129 --> 00:46:48.161
shoot a little marble.
All the marble had to do was

00:46:48.161 --> 00:46:50.683
come down and even that didn't
work, so I don't do

00:46:50.683 --> 00:46:52.780
demonstrations.
Well, let's try this.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.115
Here's an eraser,
and give it a push and it

00:46:55.115 --> 00:46:57.450
stops.
Take the movie of that.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:00.725
Play it backwards.
You will find suddenly,

00:47:00.725 --> 00:47:03.789
you know the table heats up a
little bit due to friction.

00:47:03.789 --> 00:47:06.909
The table can cool down and the
eraser can move backwards

00:47:06.909 --> 00:47:10.050
picking up speed [laughter].
Right.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.176
So, why did we laugh?
You have no reason to laugh

00:47:12.176 --> 00:47:14.349
right now because it doesn't
violate anything you have

00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:16.491
learned,
other than your daily

00:47:16.491 --> 00:47:20.920
experience, because in the
reverse process every atom,

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.450
you know, every atomic thing on
the desk that started moving,

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.151
is made to stop,
turn around,

00:47:26.151 --> 00:47:28.130
and move in the backwards
direction.

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:31.587
And every collision between
atoms on the desk and atoms on

00:47:31.587 --> 00:47:34.559
the eraser will obey all the
laws of mechanics.

00:47:34.559 --> 00:47:38.148
For example,
if you have a planet going

00:47:38.148 --> 00:47:42.398
around the Sun,
if you stop the planet and you

00:47:42.398 --> 00:47:46.726
reverse the velocity,
it will go the opposite way and

00:47:46.726 --> 00:47:50.152
the opposite motion is in
complete accord with Newton's

00:47:50.152 --> 00:47:52.001
laws.
In fact, there may be somewhere

00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:54.640
a solar system where the planet
actually goes the other way.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.222
It doesn't violate anything.
So, in all the movies which are

00:47:58.222 --> 00:48:00.986
played backwards,
at the very microscopic level

00:48:00.986 --> 00:48:03.750
there's nothing that says it
cannot happen,

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:06.872
and yet it does not happen.
Here's another thing that does

00:48:06.872 --> 00:48:10.182
not happen.
I take a box and I put some gas

00:48:10.182 --> 00:48:15.318
molecules on one side and
there's a partition holding them

00:48:15.318 --> 00:48:18.709
in that side.
Then I remove this partition

00:48:18.709 --> 00:48:22.720
and I wait a little bit;
then I know the gas fills up.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.780
That's like perfume leaking out
of the bottle.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.260
Now, take a movie of these
molecules.

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.606
When they go from here to here,
and play the movie

00:48:35.606 --> 00:48:39.840
backwards--What'll happen when
you play the movie backwards?

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.232
Let's say this guy was moving
like this the instant we played

00:48:42.232 --> 00:48:44.672
the movie back.
Well, in the backwards movie it

00:48:44.672 --> 00:48:47.970
started going the other way and
slowly the whole thing will

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:53.309
untangle itself and end up here.
That also will not happen.

00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:55.820
We all know that if you go to a
room and you release some gas

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:58.404
from one side,
it can fill the room but it's

00:48:58.404 --> 00:49:02.231
not ever going to come back,
and yet it doesn't violate any

00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:06.059
laws because if I made a movie
and played it backwards,

00:49:06.059 --> 00:49:08.885
in every microscopic
interaction between molecules,

00:49:08.885 --> 00:49:12.050
there'll be no violation of any
of the laws of nature.

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:15.579
But that doesn't happen.
Here's another thing that

00:49:15.579 --> 00:49:18.132
doesn't happen.
I take a chunk of some hot

00:49:18.132 --> 00:49:21.010
copper and I take a chunk of
some cold copper.

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:24.495
Hot, cold.
I just put them on top of each

00:49:24.495 --> 00:49:26.863
other, come back in an hour,
it's become,

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:27.870
say, lukewarm.

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:33.655
That's fine.
But now maybe,

00:49:33.655 --> 00:49:37.422
if I wait long enough,
the lukewarm will automatically

00:49:37.422 --> 00:49:40.550
spontaneously separate into hot
and cold.

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:44.986
That doesn't seem to happen.
The heat simply seems to flow

00:49:44.986 --> 00:49:47.860
from hot to cold but never back
from cold to hot.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.754
But flowing from cold to hot
will not violate the Law of

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:53.434
Conservation of Energy.
As long as the same number of

00:49:53.434 --> 00:49:56.210
calories go from cold to hot,
it doesn't violate anything.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:59.819
And that doesn't seem to happen.
So, this can go on and on and

00:49:59.819 --> 00:50:03.081
on with some large number of
things that are allowed but

00:50:03.081 --> 00:50:06.182
don't happen.
So, we cannot explain them with

00:50:06.182 --> 00:50:10.280
any known laws of physics so we
elevate that to a new law.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.800
The new law will say these
things cannot happen.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.150
But you don't have a law that
says these things cannot happen,

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:17.760
right?
That's not a good enough law.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.420
You've got to say what things
cannot happen.

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.820
I've got a list a mile long.
Hot and cold,

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:26.130
when mixed, will never separate
back into hot and cold.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:28.277
A gas, that genie that got out
of the bottle,

00:50:28.277 --> 00:50:30.474
won't go back,
there's gas that came out won't

00:50:30.474 --> 00:50:32.196
go back.
There's a whole lot of

00:50:32.196 --> 00:50:34.159
processes which we call
irreversible.

00:50:34.159 --> 00:50:36.110
They never seem to happen
backwards.

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:40.480
They only happen forwards,
and we cannot list all of them.

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.549
So, you wonder if there's any
law--see, anytime you cannot

00:50:43.549 --> 00:50:46.619
explain something from prior
things, you elevate that to a

00:50:46.619 --> 00:50:48.670
law.
But you like an economical law.

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:51.278
You would not like a law that
says the following million

00:50:51.278 --> 00:50:55.229
things cannot happen.
And it's really amazing that

00:50:55.229 --> 00:50:58.292
there is one law,
a single law,

00:50:58.292 --> 00:51:02.644
that not only is qualitative,
but is quantitative,

00:51:02.644 --> 00:51:05.788
that tells you exactly when
some things can happen and when

00:51:05.788 --> 00:51:08.999
some things cannot happen,
and according to the one single

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:12.119
law, all the things that we say
don't happen won't happen.

00:51:12.119 --> 00:51:15.442
Will be forbidden by the law,
and that's a Second law of

00:51:15.442 --> 00:51:18.159
Thermodynamics,
but what form does it take?

00:51:18.159 --> 00:51:21.625
Well, we will see it introduces
a certain quantity called

00:51:21.625 --> 00:51:24.905
entropy, about which let's say
right now we don't know

00:51:24.905 --> 00:51:27.207
anything,
and the law will simply say the

00:51:27.207 --> 00:51:29.429
entropy of the universe will
always increase.

00:51:29.429 --> 00:51:30.920
You don't have to write it down
now.

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.275
I'm going to define the concept.
It'll arise naturally from more

00:51:34.275 --> 00:51:36.992
thinking.
The one law that entropy will

00:51:36.992 --> 00:51:40.079
always increase,
in the universe as a whole,

00:51:40.079 --> 00:51:44.099
is enough to forbid any of
these forbidden processes.

00:51:44.099 --> 00:51:46.416
In other words,
if the paddle spun the other

00:51:46.416 --> 00:51:49.380
way and the weight went up and
the water cooled down,

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.415
you can show the entropy of the
universe would have actually

00:51:51.415 --> 00:51:53.360
gone down.
That's why that's not allowed.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:56.417
If you drop a piece of egg,
it comes and splatters all over

00:51:56.417 --> 00:51:59.093
the floor.
If it rejoined and rose back to

00:51:59.093 --> 00:52:03.113
your hand, it won't violate any
other principle other than the

00:52:03.113 --> 00:52:05.729
law of entropy,
because the shattered egg has

00:52:05.729 --> 00:52:08.489
more entropy than the egg that
comes back to your hand.

00:52:08.489 --> 00:52:11.600
And if hot and cold mix to
become lukewarm,

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.860
you can show the entropy goes
up this way,

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:17.511
but if you went the other way,
entropy will go down and that's

00:52:17.511 --> 00:52:20.116
now allowed.
So, one great law will take

00:52:20.116 --> 00:52:23.612
care of all these things.
So, you've got to ask yourself,

00:52:23.612 --> 00:52:26.300
"What is the one great law and
how do we get to it?"

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:31.620
Well, it turns out this great
law was discovered by an

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:36.670
engineer called Carnot.
So, here is another thing.

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:40.192
People don't wake up and say,
"I'm going to discover a great

00:52:40.192 --> 00:52:42.209
law."
People just go out and do their

00:52:42.209 --> 00:52:45.099
business and all you need is
have enough sense to realize

00:52:45.099 --> 00:52:47.679
when you've stumbled on
something really great.

00:52:47.679 --> 00:52:49.880
So, Carnot had a very practical
question.

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:54.757
Carnot was working on engines.
At the time they were working

00:52:54.757 --> 00:52:56.690
on something like the steam
engine.

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:59.920
So, a steam engine--You know
what happens in a steam engine.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.257
You take some coal,
you set fire to it,

00:53:02.257 --> 00:53:05.210
then you boil some water,
it turns into steam,

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:08.447
then the steam pushes the
pistons and the wheels turn and

00:53:08.447 --> 00:53:11.570
the train goes forward and
that's your steam engine.

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:16.110
What happens in a steam engine
we can schematically as follows.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:19.205
There is a hot reservoir
T_1 that's the

00:53:19.205 --> 00:53:22.955
furnace of your steam engine.
Then, you have an engine in

00:53:22.955 --> 00:53:26.647
which you've got some steam.
You've got some water that's

00:53:26.647 --> 00:53:29.776
going to be boiled and it's
going to boil only because you

00:53:29.776 --> 00:53:31.848
take in some heat.
Here's my engine,

00:53:31.848 --> 00:53:35.091
it's got some substance inside,
it could be a gasoline engine

00:53:35.091 --> 00:53:37.739
or a steam engine,
we don't care what happens.

00:53:37.739 --> 00:53:41.366
Some amount of heat
Q_1 is taken

00:53:41.366 --> 00:53:45.900
from a hot reservoir and some
amount of work is delivered.

00:53:49.139 --> 00:53:52.150
Now, here is an engine which,
as drawn here,

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:55.719
doesn't violate any of the laws
of physics, provided

00:53:55.719 --> 00:53:59.570
Q_1 = W,
then energy is conserved.

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:02.929
In practice you find that's not
how engines work.

00:54:02.929 --> 00:54:05.411
The engine also rejects some
amount of heat

00:54:05.411 --> 00:54:07.892
Q_2 to a lower
temperature

00:54:07.892 --> 00:54:10.651
T_2.
The lower temperature,

00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:13.798
if you look at a steam
engine--if you've gone--Have you

00:54:13.798 --> 00:54:16.739
guys seen a steam engine?
Okay, if you really go see a

00:54:16.739 --> 00:54:19.172
steam engine you will find
there's a lot of hot steam

00:54:19.172 --> 00:54:20.949
coming out of the back or in a
car,

00:54:20.949 --> 00:54:23.090
you've got exhaust gases coming
out.

00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:26.630
That's the hot gas emitted at
atmospheric temperature.

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:29.489
Inside the engine is a very hot
place.

00:54:29.489 --> 00:54:34.489
So, the car emits some heat at
a lower temperature.

00:54:34.489 --> 00:54:36.869
The steam engine emits some
steam at a lower temperature.

00:54:36.869 --> 00:54:41.365
So, the work that you can get
is really Q_1 -

00:54:41.365 --> 00:54:44.519
Q_2 is what you
can get.

00:54:44.519 --> 00:54:47.639
At least in this engine,
you get Q_1

00:54:47.639 --> 00:54:51.653
and -Q_2.
So, we define a quantity called

00:54:51.653 --> 00:54:55.199
efficiency η.
It's called the efficiency.

00:54:55.199 --> 00:54:58.889
It's what you get divided by
what you pay for.

00:54:58.889 --> 00:55:03.059
You pay for burning the coal
and you get the work out.

00:55:03.059 --> 00:55:05.421
The work is,
of course, the thing that makes

00:55:05.421 --> 00:55:08.313
the engine move forward.
Turns into kinetic energy of

00:55:08.313 --> 00:55:11.481
the locomotive.
That, then, you can see is

00:55:11.481 --> 00:55:14.889
Q_1 -
Q_2.

00:55:14.889 --> 00:55:18.325
What you get divided by what
you pay for, you can write it as

00:55:18.325 --> 00:55:21.590
1 minus Q_2
over Q_1.

00:55:28.989 --> 00:55:33.650
So, in every engine,
some heat is taken in.

00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:38.829
Some of it is converted to work
and some of it is rejected.

00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:41.835
To the extent heat is rejected,
the efficiency is less than 1,

00:55:41.835 --> 00:55:44.446
because Q_2
minus--over Q_1 and is

00:55:44.446 --> 00:55:47.582
subtracted from 1.
So, you can ask yourself why

00:55:47.582 --> 00:55:51.833
not build an engine in which you
just don't reject any heat

00:55:51.833 --> 00:55:54.209
downstairs?
Why not take all the heat and

00:55:54.209 --> 00:55:55.140
convert it to work?

00:55:58.969 --> 00:56:04.339
So, Carnot gave a great
argument on the most efficient

00:56:04.339 --> 00:56:07.485
engine you can build.
In other words,

00:56:07.485 --> 00:56:10.639
there is an upper limit to the
efficiency and it's not 1.

00:56:10.639 --> 00:56:14.780
So, what is it and how are you
going to find out?

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:18.336
Well, he's going to find out
what it is, but he also needs a

00:56:18.336 --> 00:56:21.137
postulate.
Carnot's postulate is the old

00:56:21.137 --> 00:56:24.360
version of the Second Law of
Thermodynamics.

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:28.327
He didn't talk about entropy.
You can show in the end they're

00:56:28.327 --> 00:56:30.657
all equivalent,
but Carnot's law,

00:56:30.657 --> 00:56:34.807
which is his own version of the
Second Law, which says the

00:56:34.807 --> 00:56:38.850
following.
So, Law 2 according to Carnot.

00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:44.554
Let me just draw a figure;
then, we'll say

00:56:44.554 --> 00:56:51.199
T_1 is not
allowed.

00:56:51.199 --> 00:56:56.697
Carnot says you cannot build an
engine whose sole effect at the

00:56:56.697 --> 00:57:02.017
end of the day is to transfer
some heat from a cold body to a

00:57:02.017 --> 00:57:05.781
hot body,
whose sole effect--that's very,

00:57:05.781 --> 00:57:15.965
very important.
You cannot have a process whose

00:57:15.965 --> 00:57:22.971
sole effect is this.
I mean, I don't feel like

00:57:22.971 --> 00:57:25.139
writing what this is.
It's what the picture says.

00:57:25.139 --> 00:57:30.514
All right, it doesn't take a
genius to have the heat flow the

00:57:30.514 --> 00:57:32.289
other way.
You understand?

00:57:32.289 --> 00:57:35.085
If you want heat to flow from a
hot body to a cold body,

00:57:35.085 --> 00:57:37.702
that's trivial.
Just connect them with a metal

00:57:37.702 --> 00:57:40.447
rod and it'll flow.
The sole effect of that is

00:57:40.447 --> 00:57:42.570
transfer of heat from hot to
cold.

00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:45.303
That's the way of the natural
order of things,

00:57:45.303 --> 00:57:48.826
but Carnot is saying you can
never build a set of gears and

00:57:48.826 --> 00:57:52.409
wheels and teeth and whatever
you like so that at the end of

00:57:52.409 --> 00:57:55.405
the day,
all that has happened is heat

00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:59.220
has flowed from cold to hot.
That is going to be taken as a

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:02.003
postulate, and people are
willing to take that as a

00:58:02.003 --> 00:58:04.645
reasonable postulate,
and we want to see what we can

00:58:04.645 --> 00:58:07.289
get out of that postulate.
It turns out it is that

00:58:07.289 --> 00:58:10.803
postulate that's going to
control the efficiency of heat

00:58:10.803 --> 00:58:14.510
engines, put a bound on the
efficiency of heat engines.

00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:19.050
So, don't deduce this.
This is a law.

00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:21.311
Now, you might say,
well, this is how the law

00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:24.395
began, and the law assumed more
and more sophisticated forms,

00:58:24.395 --> 00:58:26.400
so Carnot was not thinking
entropy.

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:29.150
That came later,
but his postulate was,

00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:32.623
please grant me this,
which seems to be a fact in

00:58:32.623 --> 00:58:34.953
nature.
Then from that let me talk

00:58:34.953 --> 00:58:38.611
about heat engines and show you
that there is an upper limit to

00:58:38.611 --> 00:58:41.413
the efficiency of an engine.
In particular,

00:58:41.413 --> 00:58:45.432
the upper limit is not 1.
It's clear to everybody that

00:58:45.432 --> 00:58:48.924
the limit cannot be more than 1.
If it's more than 1,

00:58:48.924 --> 00:58:51.621
you are taking some amount of
heat and giving even more amount

00:58:51.621 --> 00:58:53.939
of work delivered.
That violates the First Law of

00:58:53.939 --> 00:58:55.980
Thermodynamics.
Conservation of energy.

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:59.554
But the fact that you must
necessarily reject some heat,

00:58:59.554 --> 00:59:03.260
which you cannot use in this
experiment, is the content of

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:08.787
Carnot's result.
So, here is the engine that

00:59:08.787 --> 00:59:12.180
Carnot built.
This is called a Carnot engine.

00:59:18.519 --> 00:59:20.449
By the way, look,
don't rely on my graphics.

00:59:20.449 --> 00:59:23.255
I mean, you have to go look at
just about any book you can find

00:59:23.255 --> 00:59:25.449
on the market.
It'll talk about Carnot engines.

00:59:25.449 --> 00:59:28.320
So, I'm here to merely tell you
the words and not the pictures.

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.960
So, Carnot's engine is like
this.

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.672
Take two isothermals,
T_1 and

00:59:34.672 --> 00:59:38.476
T_2.
You remember the adiabatic

00:59:38.476 --> 00:59:42.476
curves are much steeper.
Draw two adiabatic curves like

00:59:42.476 --> 00:59:47.543
that.
Then take a gas from A

00:59:47.543 --> 00:59:56.810
to B to C to
D and back to A.

00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:57.710
That was the Carnot engine.

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:05.887
So, let's see what we are doing.
In the process AB,

01:00:05.887 --> 01:00:08.619
take the piston with the gas in
it;

01:00:08.619 --> 01:00:13.398
slowly lift the grains of sand
so it expands to a volume

01:00:13.398 --> 01:00:16.440
B at the same
temperature.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:21.090
Then having reached B,
you thermally isolate the gas.

01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:22.626
It's not on top of a reservoir
of temperature

01:00:22.626 --> 01:00:24.860
T_1.
It's completely isolated.

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.360
Take out even more grains of
sand.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.030
Now, it's expanding without any
energy coming in.

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:31.780
It cools down to
T_2.

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:36.279
This is the point C.
Now, you put the grains of sand

01:00:36.279 --> 01:00:39.730
back, but it's still on a hot
reservoir at

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:42.745
T_2.
I mean, the cold reservoir of

01:00:42.745 --> 01:00:44.728
T_2.
Put the grains of sand back,

01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:47.229
temperature is locked in at
T_2 until you

01:00:47.229 --> 01:00:50.091
come here.
Then, you isolate the gas and

01:00:50.091 --> 01:00:54.989
put more grains of sand back
until you come back to A.

01:00:54.989 --> 01:00:58.518
Obviously, such a path exists
because of the way isothermals

01:00:58.518 --> 01:01:01.150
and adiabatics are in the
PV plane.

01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:04.491
That's the Carnot cycle,
and the important part of the

01:01:04.491 --> 01:01:06.949
Carnot cycle is that it's
reversible.

01:01:06.949 --> 01:01:10.427
It's reversible because at
every stage, when you took a

01:01:10.427 --> 01:01:13.968
grain of sand out you can put it
back and you can run it

01:01:13.968 --> 01:01:17.219
backwards.
So, it can also run backwards.

01:01:17.219 --> 01:01:21.429
The Carnot engine looks like
this.

01:01:21.429 --> 01:01:23.553
Here is the engine,
it takes some heat

01:01:23.553 --> 01:01:25.791
Q_1 from a
reservoir of

01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:29.119
T_1 that
delivers some work W;

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:30.464
it rejects some heat
Q_2,

01:01:30.464 --> 01:01:31.710
of temperature
T_2.

01:01:35.179 --> 01:01:37.800
This is the model of a steam
engine.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.949
Suppose you run the Carnot
engine backwards.

01:01:40.949 --> 01:01:45.032
By the way, the work done by
the Carnot engine is this shaded

01:01:45.032 --> 01:01:48.909
region here and it absorbs heat
in the stage AB.

01:01:48.909 --> 01:01:51.391
It doesn't have any heat
absorption in the state

01:01:51.391 --> 01:01:53.239
BC because it's
adiabatic.

01:01:53.239 --> 01:01:55.638
In CD,
it rejects some heat and

01:01:55.638 --> 01:01:58.489
DA again,
there's no heat transfer.

01:01:58.489 --> 01:02:02.430
So, heat comes in here,
Q_1,

01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:06.550
heat is rejected here,
Q_2.

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:10.042
If you run the Carnot engine
backwards, let me show you what

01:02:10.042 --> 01:02:12.460
it looks like.
Everything is backwards in a

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.719
Carnot engine if you run it the
other way.

01:02:14.719 --> 01:02:17.842
Some work is put in here,
some heat Q_2

01:02:17.842 --> 01:02:20.397
is taken from the lower
reservoir and the heat

01:02:20.397 --> 01:02:22.951
Q_1 is
delivered to the upper

01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:26.080
reservoir.
You know what that gadget is.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.692
That's a refrigerator.
So, in a refrigerator,

01:02:30.692 --> 01:02:32.855
that's what happens.
You might say hey,

01:02:32.855 --> 01:02:36.112
you violated the Second Law.
You have transferred heat from

01:02:36.112 --> 01:02:38.755
a cold to hot body,
but it was not the only thing

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.792
that happened,
because some compressor

01:02:40.792 --> 01:02:44.159
somewhere did some work.
That's certainly allowed.

01:02:44.159 --> 01:02:48.047
What is not allowed is to have
it flow from cold to hot with

01:02:48.047 --> 01:02:51.842
nothing involved.
The second thing to notice is

01:02:51.842 --> 01:02:56.840
the gas, after doing its thing,
comes back to the starting

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.568
point.
That means you can do it over

01:02:59.568 --> 01:03:02.164
and over and over again.
In one cycle,

01:03:02.164 --> 01:03:04.510
the gas has some heat coming
in.

01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:06.944
Q_1 heat
rejected Q_2,

01:03:06.944 --> 01:03:08.139
some work done,
W,

01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:11.748
and it comes back to where it
is and you can go on doing it

01:03:11.748 --> 01:03:14.989
many, many times.
That's why it's a useful engine.

01:03:14.989 --> 01:03:17.240
If the substance returns to the
starting point,

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.441
having done some work in return
for some heat,

01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:21.300
you can do it over and over
again.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:24.057
And Carnot's question was,
"What's the efficiency of this

01:03:24.057 --> 01:03:26.324
engine?"
We're going to calculate that

01:03:26.324 --> 01:03:29.543
now.
So, the efficiency of the

01:03:29.543 --> 01:03:34.322
engine is η,
is Q_1 -

01:03:34.322 --> 01:03:39.800
Q_2 over
Q_1.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:49.030
Or 1 - Q_2
over Q_1.

01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:50.942
Well, Q_1 and
Q_2 are pretty

01:03:50.942 --> 01:03:52.889
easy to calculate.
Let me tell you why.

01:03:52.889 --> 01:03:58.480
In the process AB,
remember isothermal expansion?

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.795
The heat input is the work
done, because change in internal

01:04:02.795 --> 01:04:05.369
energy is zero.
And the work done,

01:04:05.369 --> 01:04:07.770
you remember,
is nRT log

01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:11.190
V_B over
V_A.

01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:19.107
Similarly,
Q_2,

01:04:19.107 --> 01:04:22.902
as a positive number,
is nRT_2

01:04:22.902 --> 01:04:27.440
log V_c over
V_D.

01:04:36.699 --> 01:04:39.360
Remember, Q_2
here is defined as a positive

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.389
number, even though it's the
heat rejected,

01:04:41.389 --> 01:04:45.130
so if I want to get a positive
number, I write the log of the

01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:48.862
initial over V final,
so I get a--sorry,

01:04:48.862 --> 01:04:53.829
V_c over
V_D.

01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:58.413
So, the efficiency now becomes
1 - Q_2 over

01:04:58.413 --> 01:05:01.570
Q_1,
becomes 1 minus

01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:05.681
T_2 over
T_1 log

01:05:05.681 --> 01:05:10.522
V_c over
V_B divided by

01:05:10.522 --> 01:05:13.300
log--I'm sorry,
V_c over

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.657
V_D divided by
a log V_B over

01:05:15.657 --> 01:05:16.570
V_A.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.822
Again, if you cannot follow my
script here, you may have to go

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:29.130
back and get the subscript
right.

01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:31.320
But don't worry too much about
all the details.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.147
What I want you to know is the
heat input here and the heat

01:05:34.147 --> 01:05:36.974
rejected here are all a familiar
quantities from what I did

01:05:36.974 --> 01:05:40.860
earlier.
But now, here is the punch line;

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:44.442
η, I claim is 1 -
T_2 over

01:05:44.442 --> 01:05:47.063
T_1.
In other words,

01:05:47.063 --> 01:05:49.920
I'm saying forget this ratio of
logarithms.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:54.510
It is just 1.
I will show that to you,

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:57.363
of course.
It's not going to be written

01:05:57.363 --> 01:05:59.350
without proof,
but the final answer for

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:02.330
efficiency of this engine is 1 -
T_2 over

01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:05.020
T_1.
So, we need to show why

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.854
V_c/V
_D is the same as

01:06:07.854 --> 01:06:10.110
V_B/V
_A.

01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:13.270
Well, I will derive that here,
then for a couple of minutes

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:15.994
I'll talk about it,
then we'll come back and resume

01:06:15.994 --> 01:06:17.030
the discussion.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:26.532
I'm going to show you that
V_c/V

01:06:26.532 --> 01:06:30.688
_D is the same as
V_B/V

01:06:30.688 --> 01:06:32.470
_A.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.152
I'm going to show that to you.
Then you agree,

01:06:38.152 --> 01:06:40.980
if I take the logs then,
the logs will cancel.

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:44.662
How do I know this?
Well, go back and use the fact

01:06:44.662 --> 01:06:47.430
that that's an isothermal
process.

01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:49.864
That is an isothermal process.
That is an adiabatic process

01:06:49.864 --> 01:06:51.820
and that's an adiabatic process
[drawing graph on board].

01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:58.464
This is temperature
T_1,

01:06:58.464 --> 01:07:01.249
this is temperature
T_2,

01:07:01.249 --> 01:07:03.755
this is A,
B, C,

01:07:03.755 --> 01:07:07.995
D.
Now, somewhere in your notes is

01:07:07.995 --> 01:07:14.179
a formula that in an adiabatic
process, volume A times

01:07:14.179 --> 01:07:18.199
temperature 1 to some strange
power,

01:07:18.199 --> 01:07:20.710
I don't care what the power
is--it's not going to matter.

01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:25.629
It's the same.
Sorry, volume B times

01:07:25.629 --> 01:07:30.549
temperature to some power is the
same as volume C,

01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:34.853
the same, temperature
T_2 to some

01:07:34.853 --> 01:07:35.820
power.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.235
Because in the process of
adiabatic, we have seen

01:07:43.235 --> 01:07:45.349
PV to the γ is
constant,

01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:48.366
but I told you can also write
it as volume times temperature

01:07:48.366 --> 01:07:51.297
to some power is a constant.
So, B and C are

01:07:51.297 --> 01:07:54.531
correlated this way.
Likewise, A and D

01:07:54.531 --> 01:07:58.830
are connected by an adiabatic
process so you can be sure that

01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:01.568
V_A,
T_A, that

01:08:01.568 --> 01:08:02.939
happens to be
T_1 ,

01:08:02.939 --> 01:08:04.871
raised to some power,
is the same as

01:08:04.871 --> 01:08:08.272
V_DT
_2 raised to same

01:08:08.272 --> 01:08:08.910
power.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.370
We don't care what the power is.
It's probably

01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:16.795
C_v over
R or R over

01:08:16.795 --> 01:08:18.850
C_v.
I'm not interested in that.

01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:21.299
In fact, if you go back to this
top right-hand corner you can

01:08:21.299 --> 01:08:23.177
see it is volume times T
to the power of

01:08:23.177 --> 01:08:24.770
C_v over
R.

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:27.188
But it's not important.
The fact that B and

01:08:27.188 --> 01:08:29.816
C lie on an adiabatic
curve means that the volume at

01:08:29.816 --> 01:08:31.810
B and the temperature at
B,

01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:33.544
which happens to be
T_1, and the

01:08:33.544 --> 01:08:35.460
volume of C and the
temperature of C,

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.403
which happens to be
T_2,

01:08:37.403 --> 01:08:40.442
are connected by this result.
Once I write it down for this

01:08:40.442 --> 01:08:43.350
adiabatic and this adiabatic,
now divide that by that,

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:45.223
and that by that,
and the point is that

01:08:45.223 --> 01:08:47.590
T_1,
to whatever power it is,

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.582
cancels top and bottom,
top and bottom,

01:08:49.582 --> 01:08:52.676
and I get the result I wanted,
which is V_B

01:08:52.676 --> 01:08:56.232
over V_A,
is V_c over

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:58.724
V_D.
Once you put that in,

01:08:58.724 --> 01:09:00.504
you get the final result
η is 1 -

01:09:00.504 --> 01:09:02.730
T_2 over
T_1.

01:09:08.369 --> 01:09:11.157
Now, there are some things you
should know all the time and

01:09:11.157 --> 01:09:13.319
something you should know some
of the time,

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:15.699
and something you should've
seen at least once.

01:09:15.699 --> 01:09:18.292
The derivation of the result
you should've seen at least once

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:20.563
in your life.
Whether you carry it in your

01:09:20.563 --> 01:09:22.650
head or not, I'm not interested
in.

01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:26.863
But what have I really done?
I've taken an ideal gas and

01:09:26.863 --> 01:09:31.619
taken it over a cycle and I
found out that in that cycle,

01:09:31.619 --> 01:09:34.438
the ideal gas does function
like a very primitive heat

01:09:34.438 --> 01:09:37.470
engine because it takes some
heat Q_1,

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:39.546
rejects some heat
Q_2,

01:09:39.546 --> 01:09:42.060
and does some work given by the
shaded area.

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:45.652
And the ratio of work done to
heat absorbed in the end happens

01:09:45.652 --> 01:09:48.480
to be 1 - T_2/T
_1.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:52.402
It does not depend on the gas.
It depends only on the upper

01:09:52.402 --> 01:09:55.329
temperature and the lower
temperature.

01:09:55.329 --> 01:09:58.808
Now, the question you can ask
is, "Why are you computing the

01:09:58.808 --> 01:10:02.168
efficiency of this really
primitive and stupid engine when

01:10:02.168 --> 01:10:05.941
we're interested in real engines
that GM is going to make or some

01:10:05.941 --> 01:10:09.949
steamship is going to make or
some engineer is going to make?"

01:10:09.949 --> 01:10:15.362
We will show next time that
this efficiency is a theoretical

01:10:15.362 --> 01:10:19.266
maximum.
I will show you next time that

01:10:19.266 --> 01:10:23.050
no engine can beat the Carnot
engine.

01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:26.669
No engine can be as good.
It can be as good but cannot be

01:10:26.669 --> 01:10:29.933
better than the Carnot engine,
and that's what makes the

01:10:29.933 --> 01:10:32.768
result important.
It's a lot like a relativity

01:10:32.768 --> 01:10:36.006
example, but to show you why
time slows down in a moving

01:10:36.006 --> 01:10:39.597
frame I took a very stupid clock
where the clock ticks because

01:10:39.597 --> 01:10:42.840
light beam goes up and down.
That's not your idea of a

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.543
clock, but in that clock,
if you can see why it slows

01:10:45.543 --> 01:10:47.334
down,
you know that every clock has

01:10:47.334 --> 01:10:50.224
to slow down because all clocks
in a moving rocket must run at

01:10:50.224 --> 01:10:52.435
the same rate.
Otherwise, you can compare the

01:10:52.435 --> 01:10:54.310
two clocks and find out you are
moving.

01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:57.378
Likewise, if you take a very
primitive engine,

01:10:57.378 --> 01:11:01.060
but you can show that that
engine is the most efficient

01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:03.087
engine,
you are done because that's

01:11:03.087 --> 01:11:05.310
going to put an upper limit on
the efficiency.

01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:08.621
So, I'll come back and I'll
tell you next time why no engine

01:11:08.621 --> 01:11:11.765
can beat this engine and why
hidden in this result is the

01:11:11.765 --> 01:11:13.031
notion of entropy.

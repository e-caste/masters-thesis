00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:02.690
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.092
The title of today's lecture is
"Exploring Special Subjects

00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:08.910
on Pompeian Walls."
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.910
And that's exactly what I'm
going to do today,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.000
to explore a number of scenes:
a frieze of figures,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.380
a landscape scene,
portraits on Pompeian walls,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.890
and also still life painting.
 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.210
And we're going to look at them
both in the context of the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.706
architectural style walls that
we've been discussing thus far

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:33.935
this term,
especially the Second,

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:38.120
Third, and Fourth Styles,
but we'll also look at them as

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.810
interesting in their own right.
 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.553
We ended last time with a
discussion of Fourth Style Roman

00:00:44.553 --> 00:00:47.647
wall painting,
and I want to show you again

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:50.895
what I consider the
quintessential Fourth Style

00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:51.460
wall.
 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.846
It's the Ixion Room in the
House of Vettii,

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:59.603
in Pompeii, and you see it here
once again in all its garish

00:00:59.603 --> 00:01:00.409
glory.
 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.890
It's an amazing painting.
 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.394
We talked about the fact that
it is a kind of compendium of

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:08.450
all the styles that went before.
 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.173
We described,
for example,

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:15.331
the socle,
which attempts to imitate

00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:20.485
marble incrustation in paint,
which of course makes reference

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:22.920
to the First Style of Roman wall
painting.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.275
We talked about the fact that
the Second Style elements could

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:31.415
be seen in the substantial
columns that are located in the

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:34.370
second tier,
or in the main tier of the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.533
painted wall --
columns that support a lintel

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.709
above and a coffered ceiling.
 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:42.669
We see those here;
we see them over here as

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.980
well--those, again,
elements of the Second Style.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.551
We talked about the Third Style
features in this particular

00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:53.086
painting,
the mythological landscape in

00:01:53.086 --> 00:01:57.465
the center that has a frame,
a black frame around it,

00:01:57.465 --> 00:02:00.870
to make it abundantly clear
that this is not a window to

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.772
something else but rather meant
to look as if it is a flat panel

00:02:04.772 --> 00:02:09.098
painting hanging on the wall--
Third Style element.

00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:11.460
Over here, another Third Style
element,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.179
the floating mythological
figure, in the center in this

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.339
case,
of a white panel with a border

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:22.340
that is made up of floral or
vegetal motifs--

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.378
again elements of the Third
Style.

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:27.544
With regard to Fourth Style,
the introduction of

00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:30.375
architecture,
once again, on either side of

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:32.800
the main panel in the main zone.
 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.135
These are not representations
of complete buildings but

00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:38.925
rather,
as we discussed,

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:42.190
fragments of buildings depicted
in illogical space,

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.375
and then in the uppermost tier
we see the architectural cages

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:50.072
that we also described as
characteristic of the Fourth

00:02:50.072 --> 00:02:50.770
Style.
 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.340
So all of these elements,
as I said,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.120
a compendium of all of these
painting styles,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.003
all in one place,
is where Roman painting ends up

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:04.990
right before the destruction of
Mount Vesuvius.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.552
We also have looked--in fact,
I want to return at the

00:03:08.552 --> 00:03:12.116
beginning of today's
presentation to the Villa of the

00:03:12.116 --> 00:03:13.830
Mysteries in Pompeii.
 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.590
We've looked at it twice
already.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.806
We looked at it from the
standpoint of its architectural

00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:19.508
evolution.
 

00:03:19.508 --> 00:03:23.113
We looked at the two phases,
first and second phases,

00:03:23.113 --> 00:03:27.408
of the Villa of the Mysteries,
and you'll remember the plan.

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:32.108
This is the second phase plan,
which I show to you again,

00:03:32.108 --> 00:03:37.143
and you'll recall the design of
the villa, where you enter at

00:03:37.143 --> 00:03:38.150
the top.
 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.912
You enter into the peristyle,
then into the atrium,

00:03:40.912 --> 00:03:44.966
then into the tablinum;
this unusual sequence of rooms

00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:48.091
that is more in keeping with
villa design,

00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:51.750
according to Vitruvius,
than to house design.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.484
And we looked at a room,
a Second Style wall painted

00:03:56.484 --> 00:04:01.126
room, called Cubiculum 16,
and I can show you where

00:04:01.126 --> 00:04:04.189
Cubiculum 16 is on this plan.
 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:05.538
You see it right over here.
 

00:04:05.538 --> 00:04:09.127
And you'll remember that this
was an outstanding example of

00:04:09.127 --> 00:04:11.848
mature Second Style Roman wall
painting --

00:04:11.848 --> 00:04:15.060
this idea of opening up the
wall illusionistically.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.990
Remnants of the First Style
wall still here.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.778
That wall is dropped down.
 

00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:24.305
We do have substantial columns,
with projecting entablatures,

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:27.471
a coffered ceiling above and,
in this case,

00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:30.639
a lintel, and then an arcuated
lintel;

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.810
all of these elements typical
of the Second Style,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.425
and especially the opening up
of the wall to see a vista that

00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:40.055
lies beyond,
in this case a tholos or

00:04:40.055 --> 00:04:43.670
round shrine,
surrounded by blue sky.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.910
So quintessential Second Style,
in Cubiculum 16.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.512
The room that I want to turn to
today, also in the Villa of the

00:04:52.512 --> 00:04:54.220
Mysteries, is Room 5.
 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.110
Room 5 is located over here.
 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.970
You see it right to the right
of the tablinum,

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.747
and close to the southern side,
close to the great bay window

00:05:04.747 --> 00:05:09.446
that was added in Phase Two to
provide magnificent views out

00:05:09.446 --> 00:05:10.800
over the sea.
 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.994
Room 5, it's a plain
rectangular room,

00:05:12.994 --> 00:05:16.077
or so it looks in plan,
fairly large in scale--not as

00:05:16.077 --> 00:05:18.509
large as the atrium but fairly
large.

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.149
And while the plan is on the
screen,

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:25.759
I just want to point to the
entranceway,

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.523
to the room,
this very small entranceway

00:05:28.523 --> 00:05:30.942
here--
it's actually very important in

00:05:30.942 --> 00:05:34.232
terms of our decoding of these
paintings that we find in

00:05:34.232 --> 00:05:36.680
there--
this small entranceway.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.880
And then what you see in plan
here are actually windows,

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.860
rather than additional
doorways.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.375
And we're going to see that the
designer of this particular

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:46.682
room,
the painter,

00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:49.834
took the corners,
took the location of the door

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:52.370
and also the corners of the
room,

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.240
and the location of the
windows, into great

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.399
consideration when he painted
the scenes on this wall.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.689
This is a view of Room 5 as it
looks today.

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:11.437
It's often also referred to as
the room with the Dionysiac

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:16.074
Mystery Paintings,
mystery paintings that we'll

00:06:16.074 --> 00:06:20.310
see feature the god of wine,
Dionysus.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.266
You can see from looking at
this general view that the

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:25.329
paintings are quite
well-preserved.

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:28.827
We'll see that they cover all
four walls of the room,

00:06:28.827 --> 00:06:32.458
except for the space--except
for where the windows are,

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:33.399
obviously.
 

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:37.137
And you can also see that this
is like nothing we've looked at

00:06:37.137 --> 00:06:40.440
thus far this semester,
in that what we have here are a

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.975
series of very large,
monumental figures that seem to

00:06:43.975 --> 00:06:47.410
walk around the room in a kind
of procession,

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:53.389
and you see those extremely
well here.

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:57.300
With regard to the style of
wall that it is,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.737
I show you another view over
here where you can see those

00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:06.492
same large figures walking from
the doorway along the side of

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:07.920
the left wall.
 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.850
But you can also see the design
of the wall as a whole,

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.783
and if you look at it carefully
you will note that the figures

00:07:14.783 --> 00:07:16.574
are,
of course, placed against these

00:07:16.574 --> 00:07:17.420
large red panels.
 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.629
Between those red panels,
what look -- they're clearly

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:25.759
not columns, but kind of like
flat pilasters here;

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:29.600
that resting on a socle,
down below;

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.680
and then above,
a meander pattern frieze;

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.569
and above that another,
a course that represents,

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:44.060
in paint, what looks like
variegated marble --

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.891
variegated marble,
the implication being again it

00:07:46.891 --> 00:07:50.550
would have been very expensive
to bring from somewhere else.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.202
So as we look at this,
we think, "Well it's kind

00:07:53.202 --> 00:07:54.990
of like a First Style
wall."

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.240
But you can see that it's not a
relief wall, it's not built up

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.862
in stucco, it's flat,
because it was done entirely in

00:08:02.862 --> 00:08:03.560
paint.
 

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.769
And yet, as you look at these
very large figures,

00:08:05.769 --> 00:08:10.649
you see that they are standing
on a ground line that projects

00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:14.947
into the spectator's space,
and that suggests to us that

00:08:14.947 --> 00:08:18.995
what we are dealing with here--
if we have to categorize this

00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:21.649
and put it into First,
Second, Third,

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:26.266
or Fourth Style -- we're going
to call it a Second Style Roman

00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:28.401
wall painting,
because it has,

00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:30.410
again, residual from the First
Style,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.484
but it's done entirely in
paint, but it has this

00:08:33.484 --> 00:08:35.840
projecting element at the
bottom,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.229
this baseline on which the
figures stand and on which the

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:41.639
figures process.
 

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:44.909
So a Second Style Roman wall
painting with monumental

00:08:44.909 --> 00:08:45.538
figures.
 

00:08:45.538 --> 00:08:48.389
And those monumental figures
tell a story,

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:51.446
and it's a very interesting,
very intriguing,

00:08:51.446 --> 00:08:53.740
very mysterious story indeed.
 

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.827
And it is from the mystery
scenes here, by the way,

00:08:56.827 --> 00:08:59.730
that the Villa of the Mysteries
got its name.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.610
This is a view over here,
an excellent view of the small

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.490
doorway that you need to take to
enter into the room.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.408
And as you enter into the room
and you make a sharp left--

00:09:11.408 --> 00:09:13.913
well first, of course,
you enter in the room and you

00:09:13.913 --> 00:09:15.778
get a glimpse of the entire
space --

00:09:15.778 --> 00:09:18.490
but as you turn to your
immediate left,

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.360
you begin with the beginning of
the story.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.902
And the artist again has
orchestrated this in such a way

00:09:24.902 --> 00:09:27.350
as to make it look like this
woman,

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.153
who is standing here,
has actually entered through

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:34.409
the doorway of the room,
and is now beginning to process

00:09:34.409 --> 00:09:38.889
from that doorway,
along the side of the room.

00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:43.519
If we look at the woman,
we see that she is wearing

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:46.759
quite a heavy garment,
over here.

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:50.376
But it's a very jaunty
representation of this woman,

00:09:50.376 --> 00:09:54.134
because you can see she has her
right hand on her hip,

00:09:54.134 --> 00:09:55.980
in an interesting way.
 

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.625
And then, most interesting of
all, is the fact that she wears

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:02.663
a veil over her head,
and it's a kind of diaphanous

00:10:02.663 --> 00:10:04.668
veil, as I think you can see.
 

00:10:04.668 --> 00:10:07.301
It's over her head,
protects her hair,

00:10:07.301 --> 00:10:10.998
and then it wraps around
her--she wraps it around her

00:10:10.998 --> 00:10:11.710
chest.
 

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.863
She's holding one corner of it,
with her left hand,

00:10:15.863 --> 00:10:19.019
and the rest cascades down her
back.

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:23.071
The artist has paid a great
deal of attention to that veil,

00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:27.192
because he wants to identify
her for us, and to tell us that

00:10:27.192 --> 00:10:28.519
she is a bride.
 

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:32.044
Brides were often depicted with
voluminous veils,

00:10:32.044 --> 00:10:34.470
like that, as you see her here.
 

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.874
And she is a bride--as we're
going to find out as we

00:10:37.874 --> 00:10:40.634
interpret these scenes--
she is a bride,

00:10:40.634 --> 00:10:42.960
probably a young Pompeian
woman,

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.764
who is about to enter- who is
about to participate in these

00:10:46.764 --> 00:10:49.850
religious rites that are going
to allow her--

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.226
it's kind of like a fraternity
or sorority initiation that

00:10:53.226 --> 00:10:56.424
she's about to undergo:
let's say a sorority initiation

00:10:56.424 --> 00:10:59.884
that she's about to undergo,
because she's about to go

00:10:59.884 --> 00:11:03.317
through something that's going
to enable her ultimately to

00:11:03.317 --> 00:11:06.690
enter into a mystical marriage
with the god of wine,

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.639
Dionysus.
 

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:10.230
She enters here.
 

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.009
Then she comes upon two other
figures.

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:15.995
There's a seated woman,
as you can see,

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:19.058
who holds in her left hand,
a scroll.

00:11:19.058 --> 00:11:22.840
She has her right hand on the
shoulder of a little boy.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.489
Note that the little boy is
completely naked and completely

00:11:26.489 --> 00:11:29.070
oblivious to the fact that he is
naked.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.778
He holds in his hand a scroll,
which he has--

00:11:31.778 --> 00:11:33.820
another scroll--which he has
unfurled,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.740
and it looks as if he is--well
there's no question,

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.330
he's very intent on looking at
the text on that scroll--

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.303
and it looks as if he is
reading from the text of that

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:44.980
scroll.
 

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.926
And we interpret that scroll,
or we interpret his

00:11:47.926 --> 00:11:52.859
participation in this scene,
as probably the fact that he is

00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:56.812
reading the liturgy,
the liturgy that has to do with

00:11:56.812 --> 00:12:00.304
this cult of Dionysus and with
the mystical marriage of women

00:12:00.304 --> 00:12:01.759
with the god Dionysus.
 

00:12:01.759 --> 00:12:04.470
It's a wonderful depiction of
that boy.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:09.687
And I also show you here the
rest of that particular side of

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:10.658
the room.
 

00:12:10.658 --> 00:12:12.899
We're going to look at all the
figures in order,

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:16.144
but I just wanted you to get a
sense of the rest of the wall as

00:12:16.144 --> 00:12:18.187
it unfurls --
this left wall as you first

00:12:18.187 --> 00:12:19.120
come into the room.
 

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.120
And I wanted to point out,
using this image,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.475
that again about how
sophisticated this particular

00:12:26.475 --> 00:12:28.894
artist was,
because he takes into

00:12:28.894 --> 00:12:31.072
consideration,
as I mentioned before,

00:12:31.072 --> 00:12:34.195
the corners of the room,
and they become part of the

00:12:34.195 --> 00:12:34.850
narrative.
 

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.389
As you can see here,
there's an empty space,

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:40.538
but the story line,
as we'll see,

00:12:40.538 --> 00:12:45.307
continues across the corner,
and the figures over here

00:12:45.307 --> 00:12:49.500
interact with the figures on the
other side of the bend in the

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.241
wall,
in again a very,

00:12:51.241 --> 00:12:54.120
very sophisticated and
interesting way,

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.629
and we'll follow that through.
 

00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:58.298
Before we do though,
I just want to show you a head

00:12:58.298 --> 00:13:01.585
detail of the seated woman,
to give you a sense of the

00:13:01.585 --> 00:13:04.048
extraordinary talent of this
artist,

00:13:04.048 --> 00:13:07.298
whose name, unfortunately,
has not come down to us.

00:13:07.298 --> 00:13:10.342
We see this head here,
and you can see the way in

00:13:10.342 --> 00:13:14.085
which the artist has captured
the moment: what this woman is

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:16.450
going through,
what she's thinking about.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.340
She's seated.
 

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.639
She's listening to the liturgy
that's being spoken by this boy.

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:25.817
You can see that the artist has
paid a great deal of attention

00:13:25.817 --> 00:13:29.860
to her eyes, which are wide open
and very nicely painted.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.068
But one gets the sense,
or at least I get the sense as

00:13:32.068 --> 00:13:35.048
I look at this,
that she is not only wide eyed

00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:38.120
at what's going on,
but you also have a sense that

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.529
she's kind of almost jaded.
 

00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:40.950
She's kind of seen it all.
 

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.264
She has a sense of what the
moment is and what is about to

00:13:45.264 --> 00:13:45.870
occur.
 

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:50.120
Notice also the way in which
her lips are slightly parted,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.058
and especially the hair.
 

00:13:52.058 --> 00:13:54.774
The artist, as we'll see,
who was responsible for

00:13:54.774 --> 00:13:58.110
painting this--and it may have
been more than one artist;

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.299
it may have been a designer who
worked with obviously others in

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:01.970
a workshop.
 

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.720
But whether it's a single
individual or several,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.642
it is very clear that this
person or persons have a very

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:15.720
good sense of what hair,
real hair, is actually like.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.775
It's the same as I mentioned
when we talked about the

00:14:20.775 --> 00:14:24.937
gardenscape of Livia,
and I said that that artist had

00:14:24.937 --> 00:14:28.595
clearly looked at nature and was
actually depicting what he saw

00:14:28.595 --> 00:14:30.070
and knew about nature.
 

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.330
Here is somebody,
I believe, who has really

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.125
looked at human beings,
who has really looked at the

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:37.168
way in which hair grows from the
scalp,

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:40.524
because you can see the way in
which he has shown that hair

00:14:40.524 --> 00:14:43.576
growing from the scalp,
and he understands that when

00:14:43.576 --> 00:14:45.509
you part your hair in the
middle,

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:49.456
there may be a certain part of
the scalp that you actually see

00:14:49.456 --> 00:14:52.488
through the hair,
and he has represented that

00:14:52.488 --> 00:14:54.418
extremely realistically here.
 

00:14:54.418 --> 00:14:59.530
So although we don't know the
name of this particular artist,

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:04.642
we can acclaim his talent here,
as we look at details such as

00:15:04.642 --> 00:15:05.750
this one.
 

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.291
The story continues from the
boy reading the liturgy to the

00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:10.940
figure that you see here.
 

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.080
It is a figure,
again, of a woman.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.308
She is holding some kind of a
dish,

00:15:15.308 --> 00:15:18.479
and she has on that dish
probably--it's very hard to

00:15:18.479 --> 00:15:22.740
identify exactly what's there--
but she has probably some items

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.808
that have something to do with
this cult,

00:15:25.808 --> 00:15:29.433
with this mystical marriage of
these Pompeian women with

00:15:29.433 --> 00:15:30.158
Dionysus.
 

00:15:30.158 --> 00:15:36.149
She is dressed in--she has a
light colored top and a purple--

00:15:36.149 --> 00:15:38.070
there's a lot of purple in this
scene--

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.928
a very vividly purple skirt,
as you can see down here.

00:15:41.928 --> 00:15:45.990
She is the first woman of the
group to wear a laurel wreath

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.230
over her head,
as you can see.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.769
And she and all of them,
by the way, wear bracelets.

00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:53.570
You can see bracelets around
her lower arm.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.883
Some of them wear these arm
bracelets up higher on their

00:15:56.883 --> 00:15:58.450
arms, as we'll also see.
 

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.432
And she's one of the only
figures that actually looks out

00:16:01.432 --> 00:16:02.710
at us, the spectators.
 

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.940
She really is basically
confronting us.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.822
We link eyes with her when we
look at this particular

00:16:08.822 --> 00:16:11.784
painting,
and the artist is obviously

00:16:11.784 --> 00:16:16.299
trying to establish fairly early
on a connection between the

00:16:16.299 --> 00:16:19.820
viewer and what is happening in
this scene.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.634
The beginning of another scene
here, with a series of

00:16:22.634 --> 00:16:25.881
women--and I have a better view
of it here--where you can see

00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:27.288
what's happening next.
 

00:16:27.288 --> 00:16:31.115
Here we have three women who
are standing at some kind of a

00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:33.056
table,
and one of the women,

00:16:33.056 --> 00:16:36.509
the woman on the right,
has a pitcher from which she's

00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:38.298
pouring some kind of liquid.
 

00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:42.070
Whether it's water or wine or
what, we're not absolutely sure.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.234
It might well be wine,
given that this is the

00:16:45.234 --> 00:16:46.960
Mysteries of Dionysus.
 

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.500
She may be pouring wine.
 

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.769
But whatever it is,
it has been interpreted as a

00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:55.345
purification scene,
in which something--and we

00:16:55.345 --> 00:16:59.908
can't see what it is that's
underneath this purple piece of

00:16:59.908 --> 00:17:04.548
cloth that one of the women is
holding up and revealing.

00:17:04.548 --> 00:17:09.757
They are purifying that or
either an object or a series of

00:17:09.757 --> 00:17:11.950
objects on this table.
 

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.410
It's a wonderful depiction of
these three women,

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.618
one woman holding the edge of
the table over here,

00:17:17.618 --> 00:17:21.385
and looking to her compatriot
who is pouring the liquid on

00:17:21.385 --> 00:17:22.180
this side.
 

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.045
And a real tour de force--it's
not so easy to depict a figure

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:30.038
from the rear and make it work,
but this artist has done so.

00:17:30.038 --> 00:17:34.119
A very monumental woman,
seated on a wonderful throne

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:38.279
here, with a purple hem,
as you can see down below.

00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:41.160
But look at the way he's
depicted her garment.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.608
It's tight in some places and
molds her body,

00:17:44.608 --> 00:17:46.568
and cascades in others.
 

00:17:46.568 --> 00:17:49.372
She's also wearing a scarf
that's tied back behind her

00:17:49.372 --> 00:17:52.440
head, and she too wears a laurel
wreath over that scarf.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.109
This woman has a laurel wreath
as well.

00:17:55.109 --> 00:17:57.560
So they're purifying;
as part of this rite,

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.818
they are purifying.
 

00:17:58.818 --> 00:18:03.076
Women, three women,
are participating and purifying

00:18:03.076 --> 00:18:05.630
this object or objects here.
 

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:09.320
This woman has her--she's not
really looking as you--well she

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.519
isn't looking at what she's
doing, as you can see.

00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:15.640
She's doesn't seem to be
watching the purification,

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.058
but rather is looking at this
fellow over here,

00:18:19.058 --> 00:18:21.509
and given what he looks like,
I guess that's not surprising.

00:18:21.509 --> 00:18:23.180
Her glance is caught by him.
 

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.450
Now who is he?
 

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:28.813
He is what we call a Silenus,
S-i-l-e-n-u-s,

00:18:28.813 --> 00:18:33.380
and a Silenus is an older
satyr, s-a-t-y-r.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.509
Who were the satyrs?
 

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:40.970
The satyrs were the compatriots
of Pan, P-a-n;

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.538
compatriots of Pan.
 

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:45.911
And so a young Satyr grows up
into an old Silenus,

00:18:45.911 --> 00:18:49.833
and you see that Silenus here,
and he's a very interesting

00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:50.588
figure.
 

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:53.134
You can see that he's
completely naked,

00:18:53.134 --> 00:18:55.814
and in fact,
well there are naked men and

00:18:55.814 --> 00:18:58.358
naked woman in this,
as we'll see.

00:18:58.358 --> 00:19:02.073
But it's interesting to see
which ones are and which ones

00:19:02.073 --> 00:19:02.670
aren't.
 

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:06.346
He is, and you can see that
this great purple mantle that he

00:19:06.346 --> 00:19:09.526
had draped around his body has
completely, or almost

00:19:09.526 --> 00:19:11.210
completely, fallen off.
 

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.752
He is playing a lyre,
as you can see here,

00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:16.980
and probably singing,
along with his lyre playing.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.058
And not only has his garment
fallen off,

00:19:19.058 --> 00:19:21.934
but you can see that he is
not--one foot is on the

00:19:21.934 --> 00:19:25.044
pedestal,
on which the--or on a base,

00:19:25.044 --> 00:19:30.118
on which the pedestal that
supports the lyre is located.

00:19:30.118 --> 00:19:33.400
But another leg has slipped off
that pedestal.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.759
Why is that?
 

00:19:34.759 --> 00:19:35.880
He's quite tipsy.
 

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.173
We know that the Silenuses and
the satyrs did a lot of

00:19:40.173 --> 00:19:42.930
drinking, very serious drinking.
 

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.843
He has clearly imbibed,
and he is not very much in

00:19:46.843 --> 00:19:49.400
control of himself any longer.
 

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.998
So he's probably pretty
oblivious to the fact that his

00:19:52.998 --> 00:19:57.343
clothing has fallen off and that
he too has slipped off the base,

00:19:57.343 --> 00:19:58.430
as he sings.
 

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:03.174
So it's not surprising that
this woman casts her glance

00:20:03.174 --> 00:20:06.338
towards the goings on next to
her.

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:11.315
Here are the--I mentioned the
satyrs, and we see two of the

00:20:11.315 --> 00:20:15.088
young satyrs right next to that
older man.

00:20:15.088 --> 00:20:20.920
And the satyrs again are
associated with Pan.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.202
And goats are also associated
with Pan, and you can see one of

00:20:25.202 --> 00:20:27.519
them is feeding the goats here.
 

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.848
These young boys--and it's true
of the men too;

00:20:29.848 --> 00:20:33.940
I neglected to mention it--all
have sort of Pan or animal ears,

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.900
as you can see very clearly
here, the pointed animal ears.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.029
And this one is playing a flute.
 

00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:44.200
So one playing a flute,
one feeding the goats,

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:49.390
both of them seated on a kind
of rocky area over here.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.500
This figure is of particular
interest.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.631
It's a woman clothed with a
white garment that is

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:57.750
sleeveless.
 

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:02.278
She has one of these bracelets
on the upper part of her arm.

00:21:02.278 --> 00:21:05.900
It is clear that she is afraid
and she is fleeing from

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.720
something.
 

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.121
You can see that she holds up
her left hand,

00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:14.393
she holds up her left hand,
as if she is trying to ward

00:21:14.393 --> 00:21:16.528
something horrific off.
 

00:21:16.528 --> 00:21:19.828
And you can see that she is --
by the way,

00:21:19.828 --> 00:21:21.750
while she's holding up her hand
to ward it off,

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.095
you can see that she's
absolutely mesmerized by

00:21:24.095 --> 00:21:25.880
whatever it is that she's
seeing.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.180
Her eyes are staring straight
ahead--

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.693
wide eyed, staring straight
ahead--to look at whatever it is

00:21:32.693 --> 00:21:37.660
that is on one hand fascinating,
and on the other horrific.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.186
She is clearly in a rush,
because you can see that the

00:21:41.186 --> 00:21:45.180
purple mantle that she wore has
been caught in the breeze;

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.828
as she tries to escape,
the breeze is caught in that,

00:21:48.828 --> 00:21:52.377
and it almost serves the
purpose of a kind of parachute

00:21:52.377 --> 00:21:56.517
that's about to rescue her from
whatever it is that she has seen

00:21:56.517 --> 00:21:58.618
and that has frightened her.
 

00:21:58.618 --> 00:22:01.528
We are now at the first corner
of the room.

00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:05.817
So again, the artist has taken
the corner into consideration

00:22:05.817 --> 00:22:09.816
and created this dramatic
interaction between this woman

00:22:09.816 --> 00:22:14.104
and whatever it is that she's
afraid of on the other side of

00:22:14.104 --> 00:22:15.338
the corner.
 

00:22:15.338 --> 00:22:18.618
And before I show that to you,
I just wanted to show you a

00:22:18.618 --> 00:22:21.867
close-up of her face,
to again give you a sense of

00:22:21.867 --> 00:22:24.903
how talented,
how extraordinarily gifted this

00:22:24.903 --> 00:22:27.328
artist was in capturing the
moment,

00:22:27.328 --> 00:22:30.731
in capturing the feelings that
this woman must have been going

00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:31.288
through.
 

00:22:31.288 --> 00:22:35.147
Once again, the very wide eyes,
fascinated by what she sees,

00:22:35.147 --> 00:22:36.980
but seemingly all knowing.
 

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.670
She's seeing something that she
doesn't quite expect,

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.597
but you get the sense that
perhaps she did know all along

00:22:42.597 --> 00:22:45.368
that she was going to see
something of this nature.

00:22:45.368 --> 00:22:48.623
The parted lips,
once again, and the expert way

00:22:48.623 --> 00:22:52.938
in which the artist has shown
the way hair naturally grows out

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:58.032
of the scalp of the head,
again achieved magnificently in

00:22:58.032 --> 00:22:59.759
this head detail.
 

00:22:59.759 --> 00:23:04.190
Now the object of her fear is
what we now see over here.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:07.846
Here again we see the corner
itself, an empty red space,

00:23:07.846 --> 00:23:10.039
the woman fleeing on this side.
 

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:12.400
What is she fleeing from;
what is she afraid of?

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.838
This horrific mask that is
being held by one of the satyrs.

00:23:16.838 --> 00:23:19.400
We see another set of two young
satyrs here,

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.040
and an old Silenus again,
and one of the satyrs holding

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:29.003
up this horrible mask,
and that seems to be what has

00:23:29.003 --> 00:23:33.759
put fear into the eyes of this
particular woman.

00:23:33.759 --> 00:23:36.920
With regard to the scene of the
satyrs,

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.700
you can see that--the Silenus
and the satyrs--

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.289
the Silenus is seated on some
kind of marble block,

00:23:43.289 --> 00:23:44.828
as you can see here.
 

00:23:44.828 --> 00:23:47.608
He looks very similar to the
one that we saw before.

00:23:47.608 --> 00:23:52.138
An older man with those animal
ears, as you can see,

00:23:52.138 --> 00:23:55.068
one of the satyrs holds a mask.
 

00:23:55.068 --> 00:24:00.022
All of these figures,
by the way, do not have

00:24:00.022 --> 00:24:02.500
any--are semi-naked.
 

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.073
You can see that they have bare
chests, in all cases,

00:24:05.073 --> 00:24:08.288
and the mantle's only covering
the lower parts of their bodies.

00:24:08.288 --> 00:24:11.634
And the Silenus,
while looking back toward the

00:24:11.634 --> 00:24:16.093
woman, is holding a large cup
from which one of the satyrs is

00:24:16.093 --> 00:24:17.058
drinking.
 

00:24:17.058 --> 00:24:20.351
It's a kind of--I always think
of this as a kind of Mory's

00:24:20.351 --> 00:24:23.064
cup--and you see that the
Silenus is holding it,

00:24:23.064 --> 00:24:25.490
the younger satyr is drinking
from it.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:30.430
So again, this has a lot to do
with drinking and getting drunk,

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:36.078
this mystery and--at least from
the male point of view,

00:24:36.078 --> 00:24:38.779
because it actually seems to be
the men who are drinking,

00:24:38.779 --> 00:24:40.789
and not the women who are
drinking,

00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:42.808
in this particular instance.
 

00:24:42.808 --> 00:24:46.105
It's a wonderful--let me also
show you a detail of the young

00:24:46.105 --> 00:24:49.448
satyr drinking out of the cup,
and you can see how gifted

00:24:49.448 --> 00:24:51.348
again this particular artist is.
 

00:24:51.348 --> 00:24:53.730
I don't think this artist
always gets the hands right.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:54.650
He tries.
 

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.618
They're sometimes a little bit
awkward,

00:24:56.618 --> 00:25:00.019
but on the other hand he really
has made an effort to show the

00:25:00.019 --> 00:25:02.750
way in which hands and fingers
grip something,

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.670
both from the bottom and also
from the top.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.598
He's very good with the eyes.
 

00:25:07.598 --> 00:25:10.955
Again you get--it's just
wonderful the way he has

00:25:10.955 --> 00:25:15.221
achieved showing this satyr on
one hand greedily drinking from

00:25:15.221 --> 00:25:17.362
the cup,
but at the same time with one

00:25:17.362 --> 00:25:20.461
eye--you can see one eye,
and that one eye is very much

00:25:20.461 --> 00:25:22.548
on what it is that he's doing.
 

00:25:22.548 --> 00:25:25.060
He's looking at that liquid
quite intently,

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.692
as he drinks it,
and I think that's very well

00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:28.769
achieved here.
 

00:25:28.769 --> 00:25:33.232
And again this extraordinary
way in which the artist has

00:25:33.232 --> 00:25:37.857
depicted the hair of this young
man as it grows out of his

00:25:37.857 --> 00:25:38.670
scalp.
 

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.999
Particularly talented;
you don't see that very often

00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:43.308
in Roman painting.
 

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:47.460
The center--we're now on the
back wall;

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.434
we've turned the corner,
it's the back wall,

00:25:49.434 --> 00:25:52.099
the wall that you face when you
come into the room and look

00:25:52.099 --> 00:25:52.558
ahead.
 

00:25:52.558 --> 00:25:56.188
And we see that the scene that
follows the Silenus and the

00:25:56.188 --> 00:25:59.690
satyrs with the mask is the
scene that you see here,

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.720
and it is the most important
scene in the painting,

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:08.108
because it is a scene that
represents Dionysus himself,

00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:12.755
this man with whom all of these
Pompeian women are anxious to be

00:26:12.755 --> 00:26:16.234
initiated into his rites,
and to enter into mystical

00:26:16.234 --> 00:26:17.269
marriage with him.
 

00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:20.750
Here he is, and he is wasted,
clearly.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.190
Look at him.
 

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.371
Despite the fact that he's
about to enter into marriage

00:26:25.371 --> 00:26:28.906
with all these attractive young
women, he's completely out of

00:26:28.906 --> 00:26:29.318
it.
 

00:26:29.318 --> 00:26:32.960
He is lying in the lap of
Ariadne, his mortal lover;

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.318
you see her here.
 

00:26:34.318 --> 00:26:37.532
And look at his eyes,
they're sort of rolled up into

00:26:37.532 --> 00:26:38.920
the top of his head.
 

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:44.568
He couldn't possibly support
himself, without Ariadne's help.

00:26:44.568 --> 00:26:48.220
His arms are outstretched
behind him;

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.913
in fact, she has to put her arm
around his chest in order to

00:26:51.913 --> 00:26:52.788
protect him.
 

00:26:52.788 --> 00:26:56.144
And I think it's interesting to
see the way in which women are

00:26:56.144 --> 00:26:59.170
represented as protective
beings, in these paintings.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.413
The woman earlier on who puts
her hand around the boy who's

00:27:02.413 --> 00:27:07.003
reading from the liturgy,
and now Ariadne who drapes her

00:27:07.003 --> 00:27:10.230
arm around Dionysus:
Dionysus,

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:11.528
the god of wine.
 

00:27:11.528 --> 00:27:15.429
You can see again that he had a
mantle--and that's about it--on,

00:27:15.429 --> 00:27:17.098
but that is slipping off.
 

00:27:17.098 --> 00:27:20.767
And you can also see that he's
so drunk that although he's kept

00:27:20.767 --> 00:27:23.368
one sandal on,
he's lost the other sandal.

00:27:23.368 --> 00:27:24.838
You can see his bare foot over
here.

00:27:24.838 --> 00:27:26.190
You're looking at the bottom of
the foot.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.086
That sandal is gone,
and if you look for it,

00:27:28.086 --> 00:27:31.185
you can find it;
here it is, it has fallen off

00:27:31.185 --> 00:27:34.130
and it is located closer to
Ariadne.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.515
Look also at the staff that
Dionysus usually carries:

00:27:38.515 --> 00:27:41.298
the thyrsus,
t-h-y-r-s-u-s,

00:27:41.298 --> 00:27:44.250
the thyrsus of Dionysus.
 

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.586
It's there and it helps to
identify him,

00:27:47.586 --> 00:27:51.779
as does the ivy wreath that he
typically wears.

00:27:51.779 --> 00:27:55.029
Note the yellow ribbon that is
tied around the thyrsus.

00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:57.951
But one wonders how that
thyrsus is being

00:27:57.951 --> 00:28:00.797
supported,
because you can see I guess

00:28:00.797 --> 00:28:04.721
it's just leaning slightly
against the chair on which

00:28:04.721 --> 00:28:08.647
Dionysus sits,
but one wonders how it is being

00:28:08.647 --> 00:28:09.558
supported.
 

00:28:09.558 --> 00:28:13.384
But it crosses his body here,
and is meant again as an

00:28:13.384 --> 00:28:16.558
identifying attribute for the
god of wine.

00:28:16.558 --> 00:28:21.376
The fact that we see Dionysus
in this state and also on the

00:28:21.376 --> 00:28:26.608
lap of Ariadne is interesting,
especially the lap of Ariadne.

00:28:26.608 --> 00:28:28.830
Because again,
she was his mortal--she herself

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.460
was a mortal--his mortal lover.
 

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.420
And I think one of the ways of
interpreting this as--

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.921
a scene like this--seeing that
Dionysus could unite with a

00:28:37.921 --> 00:28:42.739
mortal woman gave hope to the
women of Pompeii who were hoping

00:28:42.739 --> 00:28:46.608
to be initiated into this
mystical religion,

00:28:46.608 --> 00:28:50.480
and to embark on a mystical
marriage with Dionysus.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.604
This gave them hope that if
another mortal woman was allowed

00:28:53.604 --> 00:28:56.038
to enter into a relationship
with Dionysus,

00:28:56.038 --> 00:29:01.980
then they too would be able to
follow in Ariadne's footsteps.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:07.078
And so this is a very important
message, I think,

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:13.452
of hope to those women who were
hoping to become initiates of

00:29:13.452 --> 00:29:16.108
this particular cult.
 

00:29:16.108 --> 00:29:19.309
The next scene that we see is
also a very interesting scene

00:29:19.309 --> 00:29:20.798
and a very important one.
 

00:29:20.798 --> 00:29:24.768
It's the one that comes right
to the right of the scene of

00:29:24.768 --> 00:29:26.368
Dionysus and Ariadne.
 

00:29:26.368 --> 00:29:30.769
And we see here the discovery
of the most important cult

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:34.369
object in this scene,
which is the phallus.

00:29:34.369 --> 00:29:36.980
We see a woman kneeling.
 

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:43.664
Her arms are wonderfully
depicted, as they seem to barely

00:29:43.664 --> 00:29:50.710
touch whatever it is that lies
beneath this purple cloth.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:55.766
We see down below a basket that
is certainly the basket in which

00:29:55.766 --> 00:29:59.644
the phallus,
the secret ritual--the most

00:29:59.644 --> 00:30:05.690
important but secret ritual item
in the Dionysiac religion--

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.380
was kept.
 

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.728
And there's been a lot of
speculation, what was behind the

00:30:10.728 --> 00:30:11.609
purple cloth.
 

00:30:11.609 --> 00:30:13.480
Is it an erect phallus?
 

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.720
Very possibly,
that's exactly what it is,

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.297
that would have been kept again
in this basket,

00:30:18.297 --> 00:30:19.808
but is underneath here.
 

00:30:19.808 --> 00:30:23.882
Although the speculation has
been so wild that we even have a

00:30:23.882 --> 00:30:27.480
scholar who has written an
article suggesting that the

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.348
profile of this particular cloth
here is so similar to the

00:30:31.348 --> 00:30:35.557
profile of Mount Vesuvius that
what we have here is a reference

00:30:35.557 --> 00:30:39.767
instead to Mount Vesuvius and to
the fact that this scene takes

00:30:39.767 --> 00:30:41.599
place in Pompeii.
 

00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:43.130
It's a very intriguing idea.
 

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:46.738
I can't imagine that it's
correct, but nonetheless it

00:30:46.738 --> 00:30:51.040
gives you some sense of the kind
of scholarship and some of the

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.759
speculation there has been about
what is actually going on here.

00:30:55.759 --> 00:31:00.169
But it seems to be the
covering, in this particular

00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:04.930
case, and possibly about to
reveal the secret--the most

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:08.368
important secret item in this
cult.

00:31:08.368 --> 00:31:13.009
Over here we see another
fascinating figure.

00:31:13.009 --> 00:31:14.843
We've gotten to another corner
and we can see that she

00:31:14.843 --> 00:31:16.470
straddles the empty red space in
that corner.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:20.048
A figure of a woman who is
winged;

00:31:20.048 --> 00:31:23.250
the only winged figure that we
see in these scenes.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:27.009
You can see her large
outstretched wings behind her.

00:31:27.009 --> 00:31:28.920
She is naked from the waist up.
 

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.848
She's wearing a fantastic
skirt--I love this skirt--

00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:37.390
with purple around the waist
and purple at the hem,

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.509
and then a wonderful--it flips
out,

00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:42.623
it's brown, and it flips out,
and it matches these great tall

00:31:42.623 --> 00:31:43.999
boots,
brown boots,

00:31:43.999 --> 00:31:45.588
that she also wears.
 

00:31:45.588 --> 00:31:48.959
And she's sort of on her
tippy-toes as she herself puts

00:31:48.959 --> 00:31:52.140
up one of her hands,
perhaps again to ward something

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.558
off;
we don't know what.

00:31:53.558 --> 00:31:55.390
But with the other hand what's
most important,

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:58.035
she has her hand behind her
back and she's about to bring a

00:31:58.035 --> 00:31:59.957
whip,
which you can see,

00:31:59.957 --> 00:32:03.588
down on the back of one of the
initiates.

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:06.798
And as we look across the
corner--again the artist

00:32:06.798 --> 00:32:10.794
masterfully taking the corner
into consideration in his design

00:32:10.794 --> 00:32:14.200
vis-à-vis the content and
the execution--

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.869
we see the way in which that
whip is about to come down on

00:32:18.869 --> 00:32:23.459
the back of one of these
initiates who's kneeling and has

00:32:23.459 --> 00:32:27.720
her head in the lap of a woman
who protects her.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.519
Here is the scene.
 

00:32:28.519 --> 00:32:31.708
So again we see the figure,
the winged figure with the

00:32:31.708 --> 00:32:32.130
whip.
 

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:36.559
We see the object of the
whipping, this initiate here.

00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:38.130
She is kneeling.
 

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.452
She is in the lap,
in part, of a woman who seems

00:32:41.452 --> 00:32:44.279
to protect her,
or try to protect her.

00:32:44.279 --> 00:32:47.461
The woman who is trying to
protect her, her eyes are very

00:32:47.461 --> 00:32:47.858
wide.
 

00:32:47.858 --> 00:32:51.608
She is staring up at the winged
figure, imploringly it seems,

00:32:51.608 --> 00:32:53.733
almost imploring her,
"Please,

00:32:53.733 --> 00:32:56.108
enough, enough,
please stop."

00:32:56.108 --> 00:33:01.138
And she is very nurturing to
the young girl who is undergoing

00:33:01.138 --> 00:33:04.827
this initiation,
as she pats her on the head,

00:33:04.827 --> 00:33:06.838
as you can see here.
 

00:33:06.838 --> 00:33:10.450
An incredible view of this
woman, the way in which the

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:14.130
upper part of her body is
exposed for the whipping,

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:17.339
the rest of it covered in a
voluminous purple mantle,

00:33:17.339 --> 00:33:19.028
as you can see here.
 

00:33:19.028 --> 00:33:26.292
Also figures to her right,
a naked woman who is placed in

00:33:26.292 --> 00:33:29.153
front of,
interestingly,

00:33:29.153 --> 00:33:33.057
a very heavily clothed woman,
in a dark garment,

00:33:33.057 --> 00:33:36.451
which only serves to accentuate
the lightness of this woman's

00:33:36.451 --> 00:33:36.960
flesh.
 

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.336
This sort of contrast or
tension between clothed and

00:33:40.336 --> 00:33:44.109
unclothed also seems to play a
very important part in this

00:33:44.109 --> 00:33:45.700
particular painting.
 

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.009
But this woman is incredible.
 

00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:51.739
Again, the artist has enjoyed
trying to represent figures from

00:33:51.739 --> 00:33:53.440
the rear, as well as from the
front.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:58.910
And you see he has also shown
her on her tippy-toes,

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:02.039
as she is--well she has cymbals
above her head and she's

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:04.960
crashing those cymbals,
and then she is dancing on her

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.278
tiptoes,
down here.

00:34:07.278 --> 00:34:11.565
But it's an incredible feat
because she also has this gold

00:34:11.565 --> 00:34:15.849
mantle that is over her shoulder
and between her legs,

00:34:15.849 --> 00:34:19.664
and somehow she's keeping this
mantle balanced as she is

00:34:19.664 --> 00:34:22.579
dancing and as she is playing
her music.

00:34:22.579 --> 00:34:26.005
And then there's another
thyrsus of Dionysus that

00:34:26.005 --> 00:34:28.952
seems to be located--
that is located between these

00:34:28.952 --> 00:34:31.349
two women,
and one wonders again how in

00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:34.449
the world that thyrsus is
being held up,

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:40.110
as this woman is participating
in this dance and music-making

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.469
over here at the right.
 

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:45.070
To get back to this figure,
I just want to show you a

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.567
detail,
because I think in this detail

00:34:47.567 --> 00:34:50.389
you really get,
almost more than anywhere else

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:53.806
in this painted frieze,
the extraordinary talent of

00:34:53.806 --> 00:34:55.590
this particular artist.
 

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:59.760
Here the artist gets these
hands really right.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.867
You can see this,
the limp hand of the woman

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:05.469
being whipped almost says it
all--

00:35:05.469 --> 00:35:09.367
it's an incredible detail--as
does the more nurturing hand of

00:35:09.367 --> 00:35:12.030
the woman who is trying to
protect her.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.389
And I think you can get a sense
of what she must be going

00:35:15.389 --> 00:35:19.349
through by the way in which the
artist has represented her face.

00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:22.199
He has cast her eye--her eyes
are--this is one of the only

00:35:22.199 --> 00:35:24.541
closed eyes;
it may be the only closed eye

00:35:24.541 --> 00:35:26.717
in the scene--
her eye is closed,

00:35:26.717 --> 00:35:29.505
or almost closed,
and it is sunken,

00:35:29.505 --> 00:35:33.010
it seems to be sunken in a
darkness here,

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:36.920
that gives you some sense of
the pain that this woman must be

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.050
going through:
pain that she obviously feels,

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.409
however, is worth it.
 

00:35:41.409 --> 00:35:44.494
And look also at the way in
which the hair has been depicted

00:35:44.494 --> 00:35:44.860
here.
 

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:48.500
You really get the sense of
sweat drenched hair,

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.927
of this woman again who's going
through what is almost certainly

00:35:51.927 --> 00:35:54.159
the most difficult moment in her
life,

00:35:54.159 --> 00:35:58.739
but one that she hopes is going
to be well worth it,

00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:00.320
at the end of the day.
 

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:05.139
It's an incredible detail,
I think.

00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:07.840
After that scene,
there is a window,

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.610
and then at the very end of
that wall--

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:14.409
we're now facing the room on
the right wall of the room--

00:36:14.409 --> 00:36:18.056
there is one last corner,
and we see here what is

00:36:18.056 --> 00:36:21.250
represented across that one last
corner.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:25.737
It is a very young woman,
seated on a kind of a throne

00:36:25.737 --> 00:36:26.329
here.
 

00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:29.179
She has an attendant standing
next to her,

00:36:29.179 --> 00:36:32.489
and then there's a small winged
cupid at the left,

00:36:32.489 --> 00:36:35.340
and then across the corner we
see another cupid,

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.250
standing on a base,
leaning on a pedestal,

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:42.748
winged again,
his head resting on one of his

00:36:42.748 --> 00:36:45.820
hands,
and he is looking across the

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.429
corner at what is going on,
on the other side.

00:36:49.429 --> 00:36:52.260
And he looks very,
very admiring.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.730
And in fact whom is he admiring?
 

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:57.239
He's admiring another one of
these young initiates,

00:36:57.239 --> 00:37:01.074
a young woman who seems to be
readying herself to become a

00:37:01.074 --> 00:37:03.610
bride,
who's getting ready for her

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:04.469
initiation.
 

00:37:04.469 --> 00:37:08.985
She wears a glorious golden
garment that is wrapped,

00:37:08.985 --> 00:37:12.880
and wrapped around her waist is
a purple tie,

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.130
a purple ribbon or tie,
as you can see here.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.559
She is again accompanied by
another woman,

00:37:20.559 --> 00:37:23.153
an attendant,
and the two of them together

00:37:23.153 --> 00:37:27.376
are actually fixing her hair,
to get her ready again for her

00:37:27.376 --> 00:37:30.199
mystical marriage--
I have a detail of her to show

00:37:30.199 --> 00:37:30.969
you in a moment.
 

00:37:30.969 --> 00:37:34.362
And then this wonderful
anecdotal detail here,

00:37:34.362 --> 00:37:37.527
where we see the other cupid,
winged again,

00:37:37.527 --> 00:37:41.900
holding up a mirror in his
hand, a rectangular mirror.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.360
And if you look very,
very closely--

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.510
and you can study this detail
on your own as well--

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:50.230
if you look very closely you
can see that there is a

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:54.170
reflection of the young woman's
face in that mirror.

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:58.385
So a lot of attention being
paid to the readying of this

00:37:58.385 --> 00:38:01.989
woman, to be a bride,
to enter into the mystical

00:38:01.989 --> 00:38:04.059
marriage with Dionysus.
 

00:38:04.059 --> 00:38:06.920
And we see a detail here where
we can see her;

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.396
see how pretty she is;
see how her--again the artist

00:38:11.396 --> 00:38:16.085
has shown this extraordinary
ability to depict hair as it

00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:19.349
really is, growing out of her
scalp.

00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:22.150
You can see the part of her
hair, the scalp showing through,

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.239
the way in which the hair grows
from that.

00:38:24.239 --> 00:38:27.585
And then you can see that not
only is she working on arranging

00:38:27.585 --> 00:38:30.219
it, but she's getting help from
the attendant.

00:38:30.219 --> 00:38:33.635
The attendant also has a
section of her hair in her hand,

00:38:33.635 --> 00:38:37.233
and the two of them together
are trying to get her ready for

00:38:37.233 --> 00:38:38.820
her mystical marriage.
 

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:39.929
Her arm is up.
 

00:38:39.929 --> 00:38:43.201
You can see both of her
bracelets: one around her wrist,

00:38:43.201 --> 00:38:46.768
and then another bracelet up on
the upper part of her arm.

00:38:46.768 --> 00:38:52.081
Then we have another window,
and then the last figure that

00:38:52.081 --> 00:38:57.393
we see is this woman here,
a woman who is seated on a very

00:38:57.393 --> 00:38:59.349
elaborate throne.
 

00:38:59.349 --> 00:39:01.679
She too is veiled.
 

00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:05.713
She has again a combination
gold and purple garment:

00:39:05.713 --> 00:39:08.639
bracelets, she's wearing
bracelets.

00:39:08.639 --> 00:39:09.989
But she is veiled.
 

00:39:09.989 --> 00:39:13.949
So again the implication is she
too is a bride.

00:39:13.949 --> 00:39:15.630
She seems very placid.
 

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:18.547
She seems somehow a little bit
older than some of the other

00:39:18.547 --> 00:39:19.000
brides.
 

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.289
And what has been
speculated--she's very pensive;

00:39:22.289 --> 00:39:26.409
you can see she leans her chin
on one of her hands.

00:39:26.409 --> 00:39:32.148
She seems to be sitting there,
right at again the doorway of

00:39:32.148 --> 00:39:33.219
the room.
 

00:39:33.219 --> 00:39:36.684
She seems to be seated there,
basically surveying everything

00:39:36.684 --> 00:39:38.739
that's happening in front of
her.

00:39:38.739 --> 00:39:40.380
And because she looks a little
bit older,

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.849
because she looks a little bit
wiser,

00:39:41.849 --> 00:39:45.608
because she is looking out at
the panorama of what's happening

00:39:45.608 --> 00:39:47.893
in front of her,
it has been speculated,

00:39:47.893 --> 00:39:51.505
and I think quite convincingly,
that the woman we see here is

00:39:51.505 --> 00:39:54.010
probably the matron of the house
--

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:59.170
probably the wife of the man
who owned and built the Villa of

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:04.041
the Mysteries in Pompeii,
who was herself an adherent to

00:40:04.041 --> 00:40:08.061
the cult of Dionysus,
and has set aside this secret

00:40:08.061 --> 00:40:12.326
room in her house for the cult
of Dionysus in which she can

00:40:12.326 --> 00:40:16.590
help initiate other young women
into this mystery cult.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.994
Just one, a couple of quick
words about religion and cults

00:40:19.994 --> 00:40:21.250
during this period.
 

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:24.340
The Roman religion was the
Roman state religion.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.858
Everyone essentially adhered to
the Roman state religion,

00:40:27.858 --> 00:40:31.630
which was very closely allied
with the government of Rome.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:37.000
So Church and State very
closely allied in Roman times.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.489
But as time went on,
a number of religions had

00:40:39.489 --> 00:40:42.920
emanated from other parts of the
Empire, especially the Eastern

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.530
Empire.
 

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.217
The cult of Dionysus,
the cult of the Egyptian

00:40:46.217 --> 00:40:48.126
goddess Isis,
began to take hold,

00:40:48.126 --> 00:40:49.739
both for men and women.
 

00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:52.952
Women had a particular
predilection for the Egyptian

00:40:52.952 --> 00:40:56.420
goddess Isis and for the
Dionysiac mystery religions.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.161
And initially,
because they were not accepted

00:40:59.161 --> 00:41:01.802
by the state--
the only religion that was

00:41:01.802 --> 00:41:05.150
considered legitimate was the
Roman state religion--

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:09.079
since they weren't accepted by
the state--

00:41:09.079 --> 00:41:12.248
and this included
Christianity--these religions

00:41:12.248 --> 00:41:16.746
had to be celebrated in,
or the rites had to be done in

00:41:16.746 --> 00:41:17.449
secret.
 

00:41:17.449 --> 00:41:21.208
And so we see underground
rooms, underground buildings

00:41:21.208 --> 00:41:24.916
being built for this purpose--
I'll show you one a bit later

00:41:24.916 --> 00:41:28.143
in the course--
but we also see rooms in houses

00:41:28.143 --> 00:41:31.440
being set aside for these kinds
of rites.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.389
And that seems to be what
happened here.

00:41:33.389 --> 00:41:34.929
The woman of the house,
the matrona,

00:41:34.929 --> 00:41:38.250
the materfamilias of
this particular family,

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.949
who lived in the Villa of the
Mysteries,

00:41:39.949 --> 00:41:44.307
has set aside Room 5 as this
secret chamber in which she can

00:41:44.307 --> 00:41:48.581
practice the Dionysiac rituals,
and she can also encourage

00:41:48.581 --> 00:41:52.795
other women,
in Pompeii, to partake of those

00:41:52.795 --> 00:41:54.268
same rituals.
 

00:41:54.268 --> 00:41:59.150
I put on your Monument List,
you'll see an image,

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:03.181
a drawing of all of these
scenes that I've now gone

00:42:03.181 --> 00:42:05.347
through,
in order, and I think it's

00:42:05.347 --> 00:42:07.610
helpful for you to have that as
a reference,

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:12.695
just to be able to follow along
again the narrative and where

00:42:12.695 --> 00:42:17.018
each of the scenes that we've
described comes up.

00:42:17.018 --> 00:42:20.599
And then just one last view of
the room as a whole.

00:42:20.599 --> 00:42:24.541
I bring it back because I just
wanted to end our discussion of

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:28.289
this particular monument with
the point that this is really

00:42:28.289 --> 00:42:32.038
quite unique in terms of the
paintings that we've seen thus

00:42:32.038 --> 00:42:35.166
far this semester;
that is, to have a painting

00:42:35.166 --> 00:42:38.554
with such monumental figures
that tells the story that this

00:42:38.554 --> 00:42:40.190
particular painting does.
 

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:44.077
And it's such a famous set of
paintings that I think because

00:42:44.077 --> 00:42:46.963
people know it so well,
they think, "Well that

00:42:46.963 --> 00:42:49.530
must be comparable to other
things from Roman times."

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:51.800
But this is the only painting
that we have like this.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.130
It doesn't mean that there
might not have been others,

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.523
but I think it probably means
that there weren't a lot of

00:42:57.523 --> 00:42:59.353
others,
that this was truly an

00:42:59.353 --> 00:43:03.083
exceptional work of art,
that is preserved in the Villa

00:43:03.083 --> 00:43:05.289
of the Mysteries at Pompeii.
 

00:43:05.289 --> 00:43:10.409
I want to show you in the half
an hour that remains a number of

00:43:10.409 --> 00:43:13.501
other paintings,
in much less detail,

00:43:13.501 --> 00:43:17.309
but paintings that also are of
special subjects,

00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:19.909
that also belong to Second,
Third or Fourth Style walls,

00:43:19.909 --> 00:43:22.911
and are particularly
interesting in a variety of

00:43:22.911 --> 00:43:23.360
ways.
 

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.889
The first of these is also
mythological in subject matter.

00:43:27.889 --> 00:43:30.679
I'm going to show you the
so-called Odyssey paintings.

00:43:30.679 --> 00:43:32.650
We're moving back to Rome.
 

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:36.445
These are located in a house on
the Esquiline Hill,

00:43:36.445 --> 00:43:39.940
one of Rome's original Seven
Hills, in Rome.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.980
And while--I think I neglected
to give you a date for the

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.259
Mystery paintings,
but those are 60 to 50,

00:43:45.259 --> 00:43:47.489
and these paintings are a
little bit later,

00:43:47.489 --> 00:43:51.179
50 to 40 B.C.
 

00:43:51.179 --> 00:43:55.679
They are also extremely
interesting, because they seem

00:43:55.679 --> 00:44:00.347
to represent scenes from the
tenth and eveventh books of

00:44:00.347 --> 00:44:02.639
Homer's Odyssey.
 

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:06.300
And Vitruvius,
the architectural theorist,

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:10.275
writing in the age of Augustus,
Vitruvius tells us that the

00:44:10.275 --> 00:44:13.978
Greeks were particularly
interested in representing the

00:44:13.978 --> 00:44:16.789
wanderings of Odysseus in
landscapes.

00:44:16.789 --> 00:44:19.682
So he tells us--that's very
important for us to know because

00:44:19.682 --> 00:44:22.429
it means that the Greeks painted
paintings like this,

00:44:22.429 --> 00:44:26.889
illustrations of Odysseus'
wanderings.

00:44:26.889 --> 00:44:31.726
And yet we see one of these
paintings in this house on the

00:44:31.726 --> 00:44:35.800
Esquiline Hill in Rome,
between 50 and 40 B.C.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:42.206
Books X and XI focus on
Odysseus' coming upon the

00:44:42.206 --> 00:44:46.099
Laestrygonians--
I put that name on the Monument

00:44:46.099 --> 00:44:48.106
List for you--
the Laestrygonians,

00:44:48.106 --> 00:44:51.559
and what happens when he meets
the Laestrygonians.

00:44:51.559 --> 00:44:54.199
And we see one of the scenes
here.

00:44:54.199 --> 00:44:57.699
We see, in fact,
that several scouts,

00:44:57.699 --> 00:45:01.945
working for Odysseus,
get off their boats on an

00:45:01.945 --> 00:45:07.577
island and they come across this
beautiful young woman who has

00:45:07.577 --> 00:45:10.501
just fetched--
you can see she's holding a

00:45:10.501 --> 00:45:12.775
pitcher--
she has just fetched water from

00:45:12.775 --> 00:45:15.146
a well,
and she's walking down this

00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:18.840
mountain and she comes upon
these scouts of Odysseus.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.588
And being a friendly sort,
she says to them:

00:45:21.588 --> 00:45:25.233
"I'd like to invite you
back to my father's house for

00:45:25.233 --> 00:45:26.320
dinner."
 

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.597
Well her father is a man-eating
giant, as are the other

00:45:29.597 --> 00:45:30.630
Laestrygonians.
 

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:34.673
And the scouts fall for it,
and they come with her to meet

00:45:34.673 --> 00:45:38.719
her father, and the father
immediately cooks up one of the

00:45:38.719 --> 00:45:40.210
three for dinner.
 

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:48.980
And various other adventures
happen on this island,

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:52.813
but what's particularly
interesting for us is the fact

00:45:52.813 --> 00:45:57.659
that these scenes again are from
a well-known work of literature.

00:45:57.659 --> 00:46:02.849
But the figures are very small
in relation to the landscape.

00:46:02.849 --> 00:46:05.494
It's clear that the artist,
whether originally Greek

00:46:05.494 --> 00:46:08.398
artists were particularly
interested in the landscape and

00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:11.199
the telling of a narrative
across that landscape,

00:46:11.199 --> 00:46:14.329
a landscape that is
magnificently rendered,

00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:16.570
as you can see,
by these artists.

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:18.250
There are a number of scenes
still preserved.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:22.579
After that dinner,
by the way, where one of the

00:46:22.579 --> 00:46:27.204
scouts gets consumed,
after that the Laestrygonians

00:46:27.204 --> 00:46:32.340
decide that they don't want any
more of Odysseus and his crew.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:35.217
And they take boulders,
as you can see in this scene

00:46:35.217 --> 00:46:37.583
here,
and they begin to attack the

00:46:37.583 --> 00:46:40.510
ships of Odysseus,
destroying most of them,

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:44.349
and only the one with Odysseus
himself is able to escape,

00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:46.610
and he makes his way,
at that point,

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:52.722
to another island,
to meet up with the enchantress

00:46:52.722 --> 00:46:53.719
Circe.
 

00:46:53.719 --> 00:46:56.420
So we see all of this very
carefully described here.

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:59.065
But as we look at these scenes,
I think we're particularly

00:46:59.065 --> 00:47:00.422
struck--
or at least I'm particularly

00:47:00.422 --> 00:47:01.976
struck,
and I would imagine you'll

00:47:01.976 --> 00:47:04.548
share this--
by the interest of this artist

00:47:04.548 --> 00:47:06.360
in depicting the landscape.
 

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.320
We have an artist again,
whether it's the original Greek

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.815
artist,
but certainly copied here by an

00:47:11.815 --> 00:47:14.900
artist in Rome,
we see an incredible interest

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.427
in landscape,
by someone who is clearly not

00:47:17.427 --> 00:47:20.923
only looking at earlier models,
but looking at landscape

00:47:20.923 --> 00:47:25.057
itself, and is very interested
in depicting all kinds of

00:47:25.057 --> 00:47:27.989
anecdotal details:
inlets of water,

00:47:27.989 --> 00:47:31.353
as you can see here;
rocks and the way in which the

00:47:31.353 --> 00:47:35.336
rock is cast in shadow on one
side and is lighted on the

00:47:35.336 --> 00:47:38.021
other;
the way in which branches bend,

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:42.224
both when people pull on them,
or when they are buffeted by

00:47:42.224 --> 00:47:46.146
the breeze or by the wind,
as you can see with that tree

00:47:46.146 --> 00:47:48.340
at the uppermost part of the
peak.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.581
So again the artists here are
particularly interested in

00:47:51.581 --> 00:47:53.880
nature and in the display of
nature,

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:59.461
and in that way very comparable
to what we saw in Livia's

00:47:59.461 --> 00:48:03.550
gardenscape at the Villa at
Primaporta.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:08.050
I mentioned already that it is
believed that these paintings on

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:12.405
the Esquiline Hill are based on
Hellenistic Greek models that

00:48:12.405 --> 00:48:15.309
probably were made in about 150
B.C.

00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:19.492
So a copy, and in that regard
should strike you as very much

00:48:19.492 --> 00:48:22.315
the same trend,
as we've seen so often in the

00:48:22.315 --> 00:48:26.471
beginning of this semester,
of the Romans looking back and

00:48:26.471 --> 00:48:30.277
admiring Greek art,
and incorporating it -- a kind

00:48:30.277 --> 00:48:33.510
of Hellenization of Roman art
and architecture,

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:37.625
because of this reverence and
because of this incorporation of

00:48:37.625 --> 00:48:40.190
earlier Greek scenes and
prototypes.

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:41.739
And so we see that here.
 

00:48:41.739 --> 00:48:45.579
And there are three reasons
that scholars believe that what

00:48:45.579 --> 00:48:49.750
we're looking at here is based
very closely on a Greek model.

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:53.065
One of those is that passage in
Vitruvius that I already

00:48:53.065 --> 00:48:53.789
mentioned.
 

00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:56.940
Vitruvius tells us that the
Greeks were particularly

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:00.460
interested in representing
scenes from the Odyssey against

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.130
a landscape background.
 

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:07.240
So that certainly tells us that
it's likely these are based on

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.420
earlier Greek originals.
 

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.969
The second has to do--you've
probably noticed this--

00:49:11.969 --> 00:49:15.476
with the fact that many of the
figures in these paintings are

00:49:15.476 --> 00:49:18.125
labeled,
and those labels are--if you

00:49:18.125 --> 00:49:23.036
look very closely you will see--
in Greek, and not only are they

00:49:23.036 --> 00:49:26.425
in Greek,
but some of the words are

00:49:26.425 --> 00:49:27.619
misspelled.
 

00:49:27.619 --> 00:49:29.059
So since those words are
misspelled,

00:49:29.059 --> 00:49:32.059
it has been speculated--and I
think again quite convincingly--

00:49:32.059 --> 00:49:35.989
that those who are misspelling
them don't really know Greek,

00:49:35.989 --> 00:49:39.101
and may be Roman artists,
who are not familiar with that

00:49:39.101 --> 00:49:41.434
language,
are copying it and making

00:49:41.434 --> 00:49:43.090
mistakes in the process.
 

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:47.184
So that also suggests to us
that earlier Greek models are

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:50.840
being looked at,
absorbed, and even copied here.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.673
But most interesting of all,
for us aficionados of the

00:49:53.673 --> 00:49:57.617
Second Style,
is the fact that very

00:49:57.617 --> 00:50:03.403
careful--the archaeologists,
who have looked at these with

00:50:03.403 --> 00:50:05.972
great care,
have determined that the

00:50:05.972 --> 00:50:10.608
landscape scenes that we've
studied are continuous beneath

00:50:10.608 --> 00:50:13.402
the columns,
that when they copied these,

00:50:13.402 --> 00:50:15.963
they copied--
perhaps they had a scroll that

00:50:15.963 --> 00:50:18.844
they had from somewhere else,
a Greek scroll,

00:50:18.844 --> 00:50:22.130
that came from a library that
had images on it,

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:24.449
and they unfurled that scroll
and they copied it here.

00:50:24.449 --> 00:50:27.458
They did that first,
they copied--so we had a

00:50:27.458 --> 00:50:31.465
continuous landscape scene,
and it was only after that

00:50:31.465 --> 00:50:35.753
landscape scene was painted that
the artists went back and

00:50:35.753 --> 00:50:38.010
painted the columns on top.
 

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:42.344
They put these Greek paintings,
or copies of these Greek

00:50:42.344 --> 00:50:45.260
paintings of Odysseus'
wanderings,

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:49.010
based on this Greek prototype
of the mid-second century B.C.,

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:55.342
they put it into a Roman
context by providing these

00:50:55.342 --> 00:51:00.030
Second Style columns or
pilasters--

00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:01.951
pilasters, I
believe--pilasters,

00:51:01.951 --> 00:51:05.793
by creating these Second Style
pilasters and making this into a

00:51:05.793 --> 00:51:09.141
vista or panorama that would
have been seen through the

00:51:09.141 --> 00:51:12.753
window,
in a sense, of a Second Style

00:51:12.753 --> 00:51:13.699
painting.
 

00:51:13.699 --> 00:51:19.469
So it's a Romanization of an
original Greek painting,

00:51:19.469 --> 00:51:23.309
in an extraordinary way that
tells us a good deal about how

00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:27.280
the Romans were thinking about
these Greek prototypes at this

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.869
particular juncture.
 

00:51:28.869 --> 00:51:32.500
I showed you last time the
Villa at Oplontis,

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:37.213
the Caldarium 8,
and we looked at the soffit of

00:51:37.213 --> 00:51:41.034
Caldarium 8,
and we saw these floating

00:51:41.034 --> 00:51:44.398
mythological figures,
and we saw women in niches with

00:51:44.398 --> 00:51:45.409
shells at the top.
 

00:51:45.409 --> 00:51:48.237
And I pointed out to you,
at that time,

00:51:48.237 --> 00:51:51.960
that we also have a number of
small panel pictures,

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.980
representing still lives,
with fruit and the like.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:01.117
And these in a sense get lost
in the overall scheme of these

00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:03.293
Second,
Third, and Fourth Style walls,

00:52:03.293 --> 00:52:06.771
but they're very interesting,
if we look at them in greater

00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:07.360
detail.
 

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:11.710
And I want to show you just two
examples today.

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:15.146
This is a--it's blown up,
obviously, way beyond the size

00:52:15.146 --> 00:52:18.771
that it was--but it gives you
some sense of what these look

00:52:18.771 --> 00:52:19.960
like in detail.
 

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:24.972
It's a still life painting that
comes from the Villa of Julia

00:52:24.972 --> 00:52:29.150
Felix, in Pompeii,
which dates to around 50 B.C.

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:33.851
And it probably--we do believe
that it is a detail from a

00:52:33.851 --> 00:52:35.530
Second Style wall.
 

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:39.460
And we look at that detail
here, and we see that these--

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:41.889
for those of you who enjoy
modern art,

00:52:41.889 --> 00:52:44.885
for example,
I think you'll agree that this

00:52:44.885 --> 00:52:48.239
is- tends to be as modern as
Roman Art gets,

00:52:48.239 --> 00:52:52.199
because we see it has a very
contemporary appearance,

00:52:52.199 --> 00:52:55.139
I think, this particular still
life painting.

00:52:55.139 --> 00:52:59.440
We see that the artist has
shown a striking penchant for,

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:04.400
or a sensitivity for
composition, for light,

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.496
the way in which light falls on
objects that are made of

00:53:08.496 --> 00:53:11.768
different materials,
be it metal or stone.

00:53:11.768 --> 00:53:14.570
The artist has shown that kind
of sensitivity,

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:16.969
I think, here,
as well as to composition,

00:53:16.969 --> 00:53:20.143
the way in which a group of
objects are composed in

00:53:20.143 --> 00:53:22.050
relationship to one another.
 

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:24.942
If we look at this painting,
I think we'll agree it's quite

00:53:24.942 --> 00:53:25.840
a tour de force.
 

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.184
We see some interesting things,
which are not that easy to

00:53:29.184 --> 00:53:29.829
decipher.
 

00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:31.896
We see over here,
for example,

00:53:31.896 --> 00:53:35.820
a cloth with fringe that hangs
on a nail on the wall.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:39.228
We see over here,
also hanging on the wall,

00:53:39.228 --> 00:53:40.690
four dead birds.
 

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:45.904
We see a plate,
an oval plate of what seem to

00:53:45.904 --> 00:53:47.090
be eggs.
 

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:51.567
We see a pitcher over here,
which again looks like a metal

00:53:51.567 --> 00:53:55.809
pitcher, bathed in light on one
side, with a handle.

00:53:55.809 --> 00:53:59.431
And then we see here what looks
like some kind of a beaker,

00:53:59.431 --> 00:54:02.804
with something that may have
been used to stir whatever

00:54:02.804 --> 00:54:04.179
liquid was inside.
 

00:54:04.179 --> 00:54:07.059
All of this on a stone pedestal.
 

00:54:07.059 --> 00:54:11.568
And then leaning against that
stone pedestal we see one of

00:54:11.568 --> 00:54:14.811
these clay vessels,
which seems to have an

00:54:14.811 --> 00:54:17.659
inscription on that clay vessel.
 

00:54:17.659 --> 00:54:20.289
So what is this still life
painting?

00:54:20.289 --> 00:54:24.333
Is it just meant to be a mix of
objects that would be found in

00:54:24.333 --> 00:54:25.989
the kitchen of a house?
 

00:54:25.989 --> 00:54:27.949
Or is it something more than
that?

00:54:27.949 --> 00:54:29.940
Do these have meaning beyond
that?

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.963
Is there some religious
symbolism here,

00:54:31.963 --> 00:54:32.710
for example?
 

00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:36.010
This is not easy to decipher,
and no one really has done that

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:37.998
satisfactorily,
up to this point,

00:54:37.998 --> 00:54:41.349
but it's something that one
would want to keep in mind,

00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:44.789
as one thinks about the meaning
of these still life paintings.

00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:47.264
And keep in mind again,
if you think back to a room

00:54:47.264 --> 00:54:49.590
like the Ixion Room,
there are a number of these

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.768
small panel paintings in the
Ixion Room.

00:54:51.768 --> 00:54:54.360
When you look at the room as a
whole, these are not easy to

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:54.630
see.
 

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:58.579
They're so small that they're
lost in the overall scheme.

00:54:58.579 --> 00:55:01.260
So you'd really have to go up
very close to these,

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.155
if you could even reach them,
if they're way up in the top it

00:55:03.155 --> 00:55:04.967
would be difficult,
but if they're down below,

00:55:04.967 --> 00:55:06.409
go up close,
look at them,

00:55:06.409 --> 00:55:09.958
and try to figure out for
yourself exactly what is going

00:55:09.958 --> 00:55:10.670
on here.
 

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:12.956
Another one from,
in this case,

00:55:12.956 --> 00:55:16.177
from Herculaneum,
which is not so ingeniously

00:55:16.177 --> 00:55:20.139
called Still Life Painting
with Peaches and Glass Jar--

00:55:20.139 --> 00:55:22.902
but that's very descriptive,
that's exactly what it

00:55:22.902 --> 00:55:25.119
depicts--
which is later in date,

00:55:25.119 --> 00:55:29.135
around 62 to 79,
and probably was a panel in

00:55:29.135 --> 00:55:34.139
either a Third or a Fourth Style
Roman painting.

00:55:34.139 --> 00:55:37.489
We see two tiers here.
 

00:55:37.489 --> 00:55:40.789
We indeed do see peaches,
and the artist again has really

00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:42.909
looked at peaches to depict
this--

00:55:42.909 --> 00:55:46.510
shows the peaches on the vine,
with the leaves,

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:49.226
as you can see here--and wants
to make sure that we know what a

00:55:49.226 --> 00:55:52.585
peach looks like inside,
as well, so has cut a section

00:55:52.585 --> 00:55:55.889
off one of these and shows the
pit inside,

00:55:55.889 --> 00:55:59.940
just to make sure that we get a
full sense of how peaches grow,

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:04.349
and of what happens when you
open a peach.

00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:06.639
And then down here,
below, a glass vase,

00:56:06.639 --> 00:56:09.735
and you can see that the artist
has filled that vase halfway

00:56:09.735 --> 00:56:12.188
with water,
so that he can explore the

00:56:12.188 --> 00:56:16.472
effects of light on that water,
and the reflection of that

00:56:16.472 --> 00:56:19.059
water on the glass vase itself.
 

00:56:19.059 --> 00:56:22.583
So clearly again artists
that--there may be other reasons

00:56:22.583 --> 00:56:25.539
that they juxtaposed these
particular items,

00:56:25.539 --> 00:56:29.079
reasons that may be beyond our
comprehension today.

00:56:29.079 --> 00:56:34.010
But while they may do that for
ritual or other reasons,

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:36.335
they also are clearly very
concerned with just exploring

00:56:36.335 --> 00:56:38.713
composition,
light, and so on and so forth,

00:56:38.713 --> 00:56:43.150
as I said before,
which is a very modern thing to

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:43.579
do.
 

00:56:43.579 --> 00:56:47.641
We also see among the paintings
that I've called "Special

00:56:47.641 --> 00:56:49.239
Subjects"
today,

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:52.099
genre scenes,
scenes that represent daily

00:56:52.099 --> 00:56:54.460
life in Pompeii or Herculaneum.
 

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:57.079
I'll show you just one of those
here.

00:56:57.079 --> 00:57:01.125
It is a painting of--it's
usually called Painting of a

00:57:01.125 --> 00:57:04.159
Magistrate Distributing Free
Bread,

00:57:04.159 --> 00:57:08.969
and it comes from House
VII.3.30 in Pompeii,

00:57:08.969 --> 00:57:12.579
a wall painting from VII.3.30
in Pompeii --

00:57:12.579 --> 00:57:14.929
dates to around A.D. 70.
 

00:57:14.929 --> 00:57:17.865
And what's depicted
here--whether the magistrate is

00:57:17.865 --> 00:57:20.920
distributing free bread or it's
bread being sold,

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:25.422
we're not absolutely sure--but
what you can see here is piles

00:57:25.422 --> 00:57:29.927
and piles of round breads that
are being distributed to those

00:57:29.927 --> 00:57:33.079
who stand in front of the bread
stand.

00:57:33.079 --> 00:57:35.226
And I can show you a detail
also of the same,

00:57:35.226 --> 00:57:37.713
where you can get a better
sense of the shape of the

00:57:37.713 --> 00:57:38.250
breads.
 

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:43.163
You remember the petrified
bread that we looked at from

00:57:43.163 --> 00:57:48.440
Pompeii, and the division into
shapes that make it resemble

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.349
pizza.
 

00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:53.161
The same kinds of breads can be
seen here, and it's that bread

00:57:53.161 --> 00:57:56.599
that is being distributed to
these people down below.

00:57:56.599 --> 00:58:01.371
While this painting comes from
a house, and it may have just

00:58:01.371 --> 00:58:05.983
referred to the particular
profession of someone who lived

00:58:05.983 --> 00:58:07.440
in that house.
 

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.880
But paintings like this we
believe--

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.070
and it may or may not have been
the case with this one--

00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:15.530
could also have--were also used
as shop signs,

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:18.534
to advertise what was being
sold in one of those

00:58:18.534 --> 00:58:22.961
tabernae,
that often opened off houses in

00:58:22.961 --> 00:58:26.900
places like Pompeii and
Herculaneum,

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:30.340
and that may have been the case
here as well.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:34.572
Just a few words about what we
might call history painting,

00:58:34.572 --> 00:58:35.960
among the Romans.
 

00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.699
This is a fascinating and very
famous painting of the

00:58:39.699 --> 00:58:41.570
Amphitheater at Pompeii.
 

00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:43.530
You see it on the left-hand
side of the screen.

00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:49.365
It comes from House I.3.23 in
Pompeii, and dates to between 59

00:58:49.365 --> 00:58:50.610
and 70 A.D.
 

00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:54.494
And it purports not only to
represent the Pompeii

00:58:54.494 --> 00:58:57.605
Amphitheater,
which I remind you of here,

00:58:57.605 --> 00:59:01.237
and you'll recall the very
distinctive staircase of the

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:04.929
Amphitheater at Pompeii,
and you can see how carefully

00:59:04.929 --> 00:59:08.677
that is rendered here by the
artist to make sure that we know

00:59:08.677 --> 00:59:11.550
this is indeed the Amphitheater
at Pompeii.

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:15.250
It purports to represent a very
famous historical event,

00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:18.789
at least in terms of local
history,

00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:22.708
and that is a brawl that broke
out between the Pompeians and

00:59:22.708 --> 00:59:26.693
another group of individuals who
lived in the area called the

00:59:26.693 --> 00:59:30.400
Nucerians,
N-u-c-e-r-i-a-n-s.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.934
The Pompeians and the
Nucerians, a brawl broke out

00:59:32.934 --> 00:59:33.710
between them.
 

00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:38.032
You can see that brawl being
represented in the oval arena

00:59:38.032 --> 00:59:38.639
there.
 

00:59:38.639 --> 00:59:42.920
The brawl was so serious that
the local magistrates decided to

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:46.219
punish both the Pompeians and
the Nucerians,

00:59:46.219 --> 00:59:48.429
and they did something quite
extraordinary,

00:59:48.429 --> 00:59:52.179
and that is that they decided
to close down the Amphitheater

00:59:52.179 --> 00:59:56.039
in Pompeii,
for ten years: count them.

00:59:56.039 --> 00:59:59.802
Can you imagine the city of
Pompeii without an amphitheater

00:59:59.802 --> 01:00:00.840
for ten years?
 

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.119
That was a very brutal
punishment.

01:00:04.119 --> 01:00:07.478
But it seems to have happened,
and it is memorialized,

01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:10.521
that very event is memorialized
in this painting,

01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:12.360
in this house at Pompeii.
 

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.670
This painting is also very
valuable--

01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:16.340
I think I've mentioned this to
you before--

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:20.478
is also very valuable,
not only for showing us the

01:00:20.478 --> 01:00:23.505
shape of the amphitheater--
which, of course,

01:00:23.505 --> 01:00:24.518
as you know,
still survives--

01:00:24.518 --> 01:00:28.556
the oval shape and the seating,
but for a detail that doesn't

01:00:28.556 --> 01:00:31.018
still survive,
and that is the awning.

01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:33.360
I mentioned to you that in
amphitheater design,

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:36.179
they put poles at the very
uppermost part of the

01:00:36.179 --> 01:00:39.307
amphitheater,
and they were able to put an

01:00:39.307 --> 01:00:44.110
awning on those poles to protect
people in inclement weather.

01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:48.279
And we see the representation,
our only preserved

01:00:48.279 --> 01:00:52.710
representation in paint,
of one of these awnings.

01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:56.570
So again, it is very valuable
in terms of helping us

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.070
understand amphitheater design.
 

01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:01.641
The last two paintings I want
to show you today are both

01:01:01.641 --> 01:01:04.157
portrait paintings,
and you have to think of these

01:01:04.157 --> 01:01:06.784
portrait paintings,
like the mythological panel

01:01:06.784 --> 01:01:09.628
pictures,
as paintings that were inserted

01:01:09.628 --> 01:01:13.333
into walls,
inserted into probably mostly

01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:16.789
Third and Fourth Style Roman
walls.

01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:21.500
And when those treasure hunters
hit Pompeii and Herculaneum,

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.179
these were the ones they went
to first,

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:27.268
and they cut a fair number of
these out of their original

01:01:27.268 --> 01:01:29.750
contexts and made off with them.
 

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:32.505
But some of them fortunately
have found their way into,

01:01:32.505 --> 01:01:35.110
especially into the Naples
Archaeological Museum.

01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:36.949
This is the first one that I
want to show you,

01:01:36.949 --> 01:01:42.010
an absolutely fetching portrait
of a young woman from Pompeii,

01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:46.480
that dates to around the middle
of the first century A.D.,

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.929
that is, 45 to 50 A.D.
 

01:01:49.929 --> 01:01:53.688
And we see it here,
and it's an incredible painted

01:01:53.688 --> 01:01:58.521
portrait by clearly once again a
very talented artist who's done

01:01:58.521 --> 01:02:02.280
an extraordinary job of
capturing this woman.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.929
It's a very appealing portrait.
 

01:02:05.929 --> 01:02:10.047
We see her, she's a quite
attractive young woman,

01:02:10.047 --> 01:02:13.222
with wide, sort of hazel
colored eyes,

01:02:13.222 --> 01:02:16.313
sharp, straight brows,
straight nose,

01:02:16.313 --> 01:02:18.630
sort of Cupid's lips.
 

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:21.706
As you can see down below,
the hair is magnificently

01:02:21.706 --> 01:02:22.369
rendered.
 

01:02:22.369 --> 01:02:26.730
You can see that she has a bevy
of corkscrew curls.

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:29.764
Those in the front,
toward the front of her face,

01:02:29.764 --> 01:02:32.608
are highlighted,
and match very well the color

01:02:32.608 --> 01:02:33.619
of her eyes.
 

01:02:33.619 --> 01:02:39.119
She wears gold hoop earrings
that also mimic the curlicues of

01:02:39.119 --> 01:02:40.219
her locks.
 

01:02:40.219 --> 01:02:43.141
And then you can see also that
she wears something that appears

01:02:43.141 --> 01:02:44.840
to have been fashionable to
wear,

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.829
among Roman and Pompeian women,
and that is a gold hairnet,

01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:53.637
at the very apex,
which adds shine and glimmer to

01:02:53.637 --> 01:02:56.882
the hair;
but also you can see the hair

01:02:56.882 --> 01:02:58.730
beneath it through that.
 

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:04.115
Down below you can see she
wears a green garment and a sort

01:03:04.115 --> 01:03:08.387
of purple or brownish mantle
over her shoulder,

01:03:08.387 --> 01:03:12.010
and she holds a stylus to her
lips.

01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:18.619
And she has in her other hand,
as you can see,

01:03:18.619 --> 01:03:22.349
a tablet, in front of her,
and it is clear,

01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:24.050
as she puts that stylus to her
lips,

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.980
she is deep in thought,
very pensive,

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:30.211
figuring out what it is that
she's going to write on her wax

01:03:30.211 --> 01:03:32.875
tablet,
because these were wax and they

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:35.010
would write into the wax
tablets.

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:38.833
Because she is caught in this
moment of deep thought,

01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:42.362
a number of scholars have
suggested that she must

01:03:42.362 --> 01:03:45.230
represent the Greek poetess
Sappho;

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:48.644
which is why I've put that
painted portrait of Sappho on

01:03:48.644 --> 01:03:49.949
your Monument List.
 

01:03:49.949 --> 01:03:52.059
But you can see I've put Sappho
in quote marks.

01:03:52.059 --> 01:03:56.000
I think this is almost
certainly not Sappho.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.952
It is probably a Pompeian
woman, and she may not be

01:03:58.952 --> 01:04:02.199
thinking about the poetry that
she's about to write,

01:04:02.199 --> 01:04:05.905
but perhaps the shopping list
that she's putting together

01:04:05.905 --> 01:04:10.010
before she makes her way down to
the central market of the city

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:12.898
of Pompeii,
or sends her slave to go down

01:04:12.898 --> 01:04:15.800
to the central market of the
city of Pompeii.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.916
But it may also be that she was
literate, and that she wants to

01:04:18.916 --> 01:04:21.130
underscore the fact that she was
literate.

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:25.365
It may also be that this was
just a set way of representing

01:04:25.365 --> 01:04:27.849
women in portraiture in Pompeii.
 

01:04:27.849 --> 01:04:31.601
Because this is not the only
portrait we have of a woman with

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:34.980
her stylus to her lips and her
tablets in her hands.

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:38.539
Here's another portrait that we
have, also from Pompeii,

01:04:38.539 --> 01:04:41.840
with a woman represented in
exactly the same way.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:49.210
This portrait is from House
VII.2.60, and dates to around 62

01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:50.710
to 79 A.D.
 

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:54.445
-- the portrait of a woman,
and presumably her husband by

01:04:54.445 --> 01:04:55.179
her side.
 

01:04:55.179 --> 01:04:57.159
She again has the stylus to her
lips;

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:59.469
she has the tablet down below.
 

01:04:59.469 --> 01:05:05.221
You can see that he holds a
scroll, which has a red place

01:05:05.221 --> 01:05:07.070
marker up above.
 

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:10.668
So this portrait of the two of
them may either allude to the

01:05:10.668 --> 01:05:13.780
fact that they are both
literate, that they can both

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:14.940
read and write.
 

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:18.630
It's also possible that the
scroll that he holds may

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:21.090
indicate that he's a magistrate.
 

01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:24.364
Or lastly, and one of the more
popular solutions,

01:05:24.364 --> 01:05:27.570
is that this may--he may be
holding the marriage

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:30.710
certificate, the marriage
between the two.

01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:33.119
The portraits are very
interesting.

01:05:33.119 --> 01:05:37.184
You can see that she isn't
quite as gorgeous as her other

01:05:37.184 --> 01:05:38.199
counterpart.
 

01:05:38.199 --> 01:05:42.581
Her hair is not arranged in
those wonderful golden locks,

01:05:42.581 --> 01:05:47.199
but is kind of fizzy over her
forehead and down her neck.

01:05:47.199 --> 01:05:49.099
As you can see here,
her ears stick out.

01:05:49.099 --> 01:05:50.309
She has a uni-brow.
 

01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:54.900
But she's more than happy to be
represented, as she was,

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:59.072
preserved for posterity,
as she was, along with her

01:05:59.072 --> 01:06:00.909
husband over here.
 

01:06:00.909 --> 01:06:03.494
And if you look at the
portrait, you will see again

01:06:03.494 --> 01:06:05.510
that it has a black frame around
it,

01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:09.434
and then a maroon frame,
which tells us again that this

01:06:09.434 --> 01:06:13.414
was inserted into a wall,
a Third or Fourth Style wall,

01:06:13.414 --> 01:06:17.036
just like the mythological
paintings were inserted into

01:06:17.036 --> 01:06:21.068
those walls,
as a painting that was located

01:06:21.068 --> 01:06:26.476
in the center of that wall,
and in this case emphasized the

01:06:26.476 --> 01:06:32.869
owners of this particular house,
and their undying love for each

01:06:32.869 --> 01:06:35.289
other--
their relationship honors their

01:06:35.289 --> 01:06:37.360
marriage--
and served as a kind of

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:41.652
counterpart to a portrait of the
loving couple that one might put

01:06:41.652 --> 01:06:44.331
on a mantelpiece,
or on a piano,

01:06:44.331 --> 01:06:46.329
in one's house today.
 

01:06:46.329 --> 01:06:48.739
So you have to think of it as
quite comparable to that.

01:06:48.739 --> 01:06:50.699
Again, when you wander through
Pompeii,

01:06:50.699 --> 01:06:52.679
you don't see many of these
portraits in situ,

01:06:52.679 --> 01:06:55.682
in large part because they were
so popular with treasure

01:06:55.682 --> 01:06:56.230
hunters.
 

01:06:56.230 --> 01:07:01.000
But fortunately we do have a
few preserved from both Pompeii

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.233
and Herculaneum,
and those can be seen in

01:07:04.233 --> 01:07:06.659
museums like Naples today.
 

01:07:06.659 --> 01:07:07.170
Thank you.

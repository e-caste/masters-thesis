00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.133
PAUL FREEDMAN: Good morning.

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.400
Questions or problems?

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:11.800
So today, this week, we
begin to talk more

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.467
seriously about religion.

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:17.067
And I remind you, we're talking
about Christianity in

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:25.233
particular not because of its
spiritual teachings, exactly,

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:29.267
but we're interested in the
Church as a power and as a

00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:34.233
power dealing with, allied
to, but different

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:37.167
from the Roman Empire.

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:40.700
Everything changes with the
conversion of Constantine.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.000
The Church becomes first
tolerated, then official, and

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.500
then finally the sole legal
religion, except for Judaism,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.200
by order of the Emperor
Theodosius the Great in 393.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.100
On the other hand, in order to
understand the Church as a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.700
power or the politics of this
period, we do have to

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.033
understand the doctrine,
because

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:12.000
people fought over doctrine.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.633
And as you've seen in the Jones
reading, they invoked

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:17.533
the emperor's intervention.

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:21.967
This is not a question as might
be what you would expect

00:01:21.967 --> 00:01:28.600
today of a religion split about
various problems of

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.600
dogma solving those problems
itself or splitting off into

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.833
two factions.

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:41.733
The questions over the
relationship between the

00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:46.533
persons of the Trinity,
Arianism, or the nature of

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:51.533
priestly office, Donatism,
provoked right from the year

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:56.433
of Constantine's conversion,
312, divisive fights.

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:59.400
And they're only the first.
I urge you to

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.867
have fun with heresies.

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:03.567
Heresies are neat.

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:06.200
Professor Carlos Eire
is teaching a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.233
freshman seminar, I believe.

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:10.500
Is it not called "Basic
Heresies." What is it?

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.533
STUDENT: "Essential Heresies."

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:13.100
PROFESSOR: "Essential
Heresies." Yes,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.000
even better.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.767
And I don't know of any quiz
shows where you can

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:23.467
demonstrate expertise on this,
but there ought to be.

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:27.633
Or there ought to be sites on
the Internet where you can get

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:28.967
a perfect score.

00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:33.333
We're only touching the surface,
the proverbial tip of

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:38.000
the iceberg, to use a cliche.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.433
There are lots of heresies.

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.867
There's a lot of division
in the church.

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:46.700
Why not just say, "Hey, you
believe that the Father is

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.500
superior to the Son, and I
believe that they're coequal.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.200
So what?" That's so 2011.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.333
Or actually, it's so 2000.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:07.600
Because we ought to be used to
religious doctrines having

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.400
military or other kinds
of violent effects.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.933
So I'm not going to have to
justify for you the fact that

00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:17.200
we're spending some time
on religion, I hope.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.267
But if you do want me to,
just remind me what

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:21.567
the rationale is.

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:24.133
If your roommates are bothering
you because you're

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:28.233
quizzing them about the relation
between the persons

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:32.300
of the Trinity, have them
email me or set up an

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.700
appointment, and I'll explain
why it's important.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.467
I'd be glad to do this
as a public service.

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:43.300
Or my Facebook page, whatever.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.433
This is a situation created
by Constantine.

00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:52.467
We've seen Constantine's fairly
long reign transform

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:53.967
the Roman Empire.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:59.567
We emphasized the creation of
the city of Constantinople as

00:03:59.567 --> 00:04:04.100
a second capital and the favor
shown towards the church, so

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.100
that when Constantine died
in 337, 40%, 50%, a large

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.400
percentage of the Empire's
population was Christian.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.033
When he died, the Roman Empire
seemed to have been restored

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:23.333
to its former glory.

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:26.767
That chapter that begins the
reading for today in Brown's

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:31.600
World of Late Antiquity is
entitled, "A World Restored."

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.467
And he emphasizes this because,
traditionally,

00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:38.433
historians saw the fourth
century through the lens of

00:04:38.433 --> 00:04:43.967
the sack of Rome in 410 as
a period of decline.

00:04:43.967 --> 00:04:48.333
In 410, as we will discuss next
week, the city of Rome

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:53.700
was pillaged and partly burned
by the Visigoths, a--

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.233
I hate to use the word "tribe,"

00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:58.600
but don't tell anybody--

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.900
tribe of barbarians who had
entered the Empire across the

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.667
Danube and the Balkans.

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:12.333
This was a cataclysmic event,
and it ushered in successive

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:15.167
crises in the Western
Empire that

00:05:15.167 --> 00:05:18.400
would lead to its collapse.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.600
This weakness of the Western
Empire is partly military,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.033
partly political, and partly
internal, a result of

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:32.067
weaknesses, of instability,
culture, and the economy.

00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:37.667
It's always hard to say why
empires fall in some absolute

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:41.667
sense, even though we can see
in retrospect the signs of

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:42.967
their decline.

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.900
One of the signs Brown talks
about in the reading for today

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.233
fairly extensively, and that
is the inequality among the

00:05:51.233 --> 00:05:55.300
rich and poor grows.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.567
On the other hand, this is a
period of inequality, but also

00:06:00.567 --> 00:06:03.133
social mobility.

00:06:03.133 --> 00:06:08.700
There are a lot of paths open
to barbarians, even.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.267
In this period, barbarians
become important figures in

00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:13.667
the Roman army.

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:20.100
And indeed, the army is a path
of upward social mobility, a

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.333
very important one.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.567
In general, as I've said,
between 337 and 410, between

00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:33.500
the death of Constantine and the
sack of Rome, people did

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.167
not see themselves as living
in a period of decline.

00:06:38.167 --> 00:06:42.667
They did see themselves as
living in a period of real

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:49.100
change, the most dramatic of
which was the movement towards

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.300
Christianity.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.900
And the most dramatic example of
that movement is the reign

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.267
of the Emperor Julian.

00:06:56.267 --> 00:06:59.300
I've given you a handout
that shows the

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.900
emperors of this period.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.867
Notice that some of them reign
in the East, some in the West,

00:07:07.867 --> 00:07:13.033
and then some usually briefly
reunify the empire.

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:17.800
We're in a transitional period
ushered in by Diocletian when

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.900
the Empire is sometimes divided
and sometimes not.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.833
With the death of Theodosius in
395, the third-to-last of

00:07:27.833 --> 00:07:32.433
those emperors on the list, he
had been sole emperor for

00:07:32.433 --> 00:07:33.233
three years.

00:07:33.233 --> 00:07:37.000
With his death and the division
of the Empire between

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.300
his son Honorius, ruling
from Ravenna--

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.067
the Western capital now, in
what's now northern Italy--

00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:48.200
and Arcadius, ruling from
Constantinople, from that

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.500
point on, we can really speak
of two different emperors.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:58.000
And almost always, there were
two emperors until the

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.033
collapse of the Western Empire
in the late fifth century.

00:08:05.467 --> 00:08:09.567
Questions at this point?

00:08:09.567 --> 00:08:17.033
So the reign of Julian
the Apostate--

00:08:17.033 --> 00:08:21.967
"Apostate" because he was born
as a Christian and tried to

00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:26.200
restore the traditional
Roman religion--

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.167
360 to 363.

00:08:29.167 --> 00:08:35.400
His failure shows the weakness
of what we can call paganism

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.567
or traditional Roman religion.

00:08:38.567 --> 00:08:44.167
By this time, Christianity
was too big to roll back.

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:45.533
Julian tried.

00:08:45.533 --> 00:08:48.167
He tried to reestablish
the temples.

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:51.433
He tried to reestablish
the vigor of the

00:08:51.433 --> 00:08:53.267
cults of the gods.

00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:58.433
He was an eclectic worshiper of
many different gods, but he

00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:00.367
also was a philosopher.

00:09:00.367 --> 00:09:04.933
He is a wonderful, if
sad, example of an

00:09:04.933 --> 00:09:07.600
intellectual in power.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.933
Very few of these emperors
were what would be called

00:09:11.933 --> 00:09:14.067
intellectual in the sense--

00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:18.233
many of them were cultivated,
they liked the equivalent of

00:09:18.233 --> 00:09:19.767
classical music and art.

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:24.400
But Marcus Aurelius is a
philosopher, and Julian at

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.100
least is a would-be
philosopher.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.633
He had a beard.

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:31.733
He studied in Athens.

00:09:31.733 --> 00:09:33.900
He was very unsuccessful,
though.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.300
People did not follow
his doctrines.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.267
He was a very good
military leader.

00:09:38.267 --> 00:09:44.400
His troops, when he was on the
Rhine frontier in what's now

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.600
France and Germany, were
extremely loyal to him.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.433
But as emperor, not only did
the church oppose him, but

00:09:52.433 --> 00:09:54.133
many of his own followers did.

00:09:54.133 --> 00:09:58.367
He died in an unsuccessful
campaign against the Persians

00:09:58.367 --> 00:10:00.600
of perhaps murdered--

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.167
unclear.

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:09.933
But with his defeat, the end of
civic polytheism, of that

00:10:09.933 --> 00:10:15.300
traditional urban, upper-class
worship of the Olympian gods

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.200
was in permanent eclipse.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.800
The decree of the Emperor
Theodosius that I referred to

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.800
already of 393 proclaiming
Christianity the only legal

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.500
religion, except for a small
space allowed for Judaism, did

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.933
not really mean that everybody
in the Empire was

00:10:35.933 --> 00:10:38.133
a practicing Christian.

00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:39.300
The two groups [correction: most
significant group] that

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:44.867
would be outside of that
definition are the people of

00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:49.333
the countryside, a very large
number of people who would

00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:53.400
either continue their
traditional polytheistic local

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.033
worship of local gods or
assimilate that worship to

00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.200
Christianity.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.633
We're going to be talking
a lot about saints

00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:03.333
in a couple of weeks..

00:11:03.333 --> 00:11:07.000
On some obvious level, which I
don't want to exaggerate but

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.700
which is nevertheless
there, the saints--

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.467
and there are many of them--

00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:12.867
they are holy figures.

00:11:12.867 --> 00:11:15.367
They're not gods,
but they're more

00:11:15.367 --> 00:11:16.900
powerful than human beings.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.467
The saints are a kind of
substitute for polytheism.

00:11:21.467 --> 00:11:25.467
We'll talk about why
and how that works.

00:11:25.467 --> 00:11:29.767
The other class that tended to
resist Christianity to the

00:11:29.767 --> 00:11:32.633
last was the very upper
stratum of the Roman

00:11:32.633 --> 00:11:34.000
senatorial elite--

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.900
the people who were the most
cultivated adherents of the

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.133
traditional religion--

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:44.367
and philosophers, people who
followed Plato, for example,

00:11:44.367 --> 00:11:45.433
known as the Platonists.

00:11:45.433 --> 00:11:47.600
And we're going to come to them,
because they're very

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.433
important for Augustine's
Confessions.

00:11:54.033 --> 00:11:57.733
Constantine was succeeded
by his sons.

00:11:57.733 --> 00:12:02.433
After two of the sons died,
Constantius is ruled alone.

00:12:02.433 --> 00:12:05.167
Constantius assured that he
would rule alone by massacring

00:12:05.167 --> 00:12:06.233
most of his family.

00:12:06.233 --> 00:12:09.433
Julian was one of only two that
he allowed to survive,

00:12:09.433 --> 00:12:11.267
and he shouldn't have, because
Julian overthrew him.

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:17.900
This is brass-knuckle
politics, I guess.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.967
The chief preoccupations of
these rulers of the fourth

00:12:20.967 --> 00:12:27.267
century were the same as when
we started out: the Persian

00:12:27.267 --> 00:12:31.733
threat on the eastern frontier,
the barbarian threat

00:12:31.733 --> 00:12:35.767
on the Rhine-Danube frontier.

00:12:35.767 --> 00:12:40.400
But there are also other
problems that the

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.967
third-century emperors had not
faced, and these are religious

00:12:44.967 --> 00:12:50.300
problems. They are,
in particular,

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.733
Arianism and Donatism.

00:12:52.733 --> 00:12:56.333
And we've seen a little bit
about these from the reading

00:12:56.333 --> 00:13:00.267
about Constantine for the
first assignment, but

00:13:00.267 --> 00:13:01.367
let's go over this.

00:13:01.367 --> 00:13:03.067
Arianism.

00:13:03.067 --> 00:13:06.400
Please remember that with
a "y," this takes on a

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.767
completely different meaning.

00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:13.467
Aryan is this discredited racial
theory identified, but

00:13:13.467 --> 00:13:16.533
not invented by, Nazism.

00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:20.333
Arian with an "i" is a
follower of Arius.

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:25.800
Arius was a priest from
Alexandria influenced by ideas

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:32.467
from Plato about the absolute
and unknowable nature of God.

00:13:32.467 --> 00:13:36.000
Any religion, but Christianity
in particular, has a problem:

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.833
If you make God too absolute and
unapproachable, then why

00:13:40.833 --> 00:13:43.567
does he care about us?

00:13:43.567 --> 00:13:47.500
If you make Him too
approachable, then how is he

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.800
powerful enough to transcend
the world?

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.067
Platonism--

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.333
that is, the philosophy of
followers of Plato--

00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:07.400
emphasizes the absolute,
emphasizes the inferiority of

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.400
what we can understand with
our eyes, with our other

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:16.200
senses, and the superiority
of the spiritual.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.667
The reason the spiritual is
superior to the material in

00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:24.900
Platonism and in Buddhism and in
many other philosophies is

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:33.633
that the material is mortal,
rots, dies, passes away.

00:14:33.633 --> 00:14:38.000
The problem for many people, not
just people in the modern

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.733
world, is that the material is
right here, and the spiritual

00:14:42.733 --> 00:14:48.533
is hard to apprehend or prove.

00:14:48.533 --> 00:14:52.833
But most people who think about
it most of the time in

00:14:52.833 --> 00:14:56.467
history agree that the spiritual
is superior, because

00:14:56.467 --> 00:14:59.467
it is immortal.

00:14:59.467 --> 00:15:05.433
Therefore, those who emphasize
the spiritual emphasize this

00:15:05.433 --> 00:15:10.800
kind of unknowability,
the mystery, the

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.233
not-easy-to-apprehend-ness
of the supernatural.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.133
For Platonists and for Arians,
God was placed

00:15:22.133 --> 00:15:24.733
infinitely high above us.

00:15:24.733 --> 00:15:28.300
Now, Christianity has as its
great strength, in many

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.533
respects-- just speaking
of the power of ideas--

00:15:31.533 --> 00:15:34.633
the fact that God becomes man.

00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:40.467
Christ is incarnated; that
means he becomes flesh.

00:15:40.467 --> 00:15:45.000
This is not a common
religious idea.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.933
Mohammed is not God.

00:15:47.933 --> 00:15:49.900
He is a messenger.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.733
In Judaism, there are prophets,
but they are not

00:15:53.733 --> 00:15:57.833
made of the same substance
as God.

00:15:57.833 --> 00:16:02.300
There are religions in which
a holy man becomes

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.500
supernatural--

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.167
a lot of religions
of the East.

00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:12.367
But in Christianity,
Christ is God.

00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:15.933
God is manifested
in three forms--

00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:17.000
the Trinity--

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.667
the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost. Arianism says that

00:16:23.667 --> 00:16:29.400
Christ is essentially different
from God the Father

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:36.167
in some fundamental way, that
Christ was created by God as a

00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:39.767
way of interacting
with the world.

00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:44.567
If you have studied Plato or
were in DS and remember some

00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:49.333
of those key concepts, in
Platonism, there's the One,

00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:50.933
and then there's the Demiurge.

00:16:50.933 --> 00:16:53.467
The Demiurge is this
hard-working guy or

00:16:53.467 --> 00:16:56.333
hardworking force, whatever
you want to call it, who

00:16:56.333 --> 00:16:59.033
interacts between the divine
and the material.

00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:01.500
He's divine, all right,
but he creates things.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:07.133
He's the one who is out there
creating the spirit as well as

00:17:07.133 --> 00:17:10.800
matter, creating the world and
the universe, indeed, as we

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.633
know it, while the
One is at rest.

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:18.267
So similarly in Arianism,
Christ is the one who's

00:17:18.267 --> 00:17:20.967
intervening on Earth, indeed,

00:17:20.967 --> 00:17:24.033
sacrificing Himself for
humanity.

00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:25.967
God the Father remains
in heaven.

00:17:25.967 --> 00:17:30.667
This is not what Christianity
most of the time teaches.

00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:36.467
Christianity or the Orthodox
or Catholic view is that

00:17:36.467 --> 00:17:39.467
Christ and God are of
the same substance.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.800
The Arians therefore are
subordinationists.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.167
They subordinate
Christ to God.

00:17:50.167 --> 00:17:52.767
A convenient way of remembering
them is their

00:17:52.767 --> 00:18:01.000
tagline: "There was a time when
Christ was not." It's a

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.500
supernatural, metaphysical time,
but God made Christ.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:10.033
This goes against the creed
enacted at Nicaea, which to

00:18:10.033 --> 00:18:15.500
this day is the standard
confession of faith of

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.300
Christian denominations.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:23.900
The Nicene Creed, as it is
known, says that all persons

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.767
of the Trinity are eternal,
co-eternal.

00:18:27.767 --> 00:18:31.800
God did not create Christ.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.833
Now, Arianism appealed to people
partly because they

00:18:35.833 --> 00:18:37.133
worried about the Trinity.

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:40.933
The Trinity could be denounced
by anti-Christians as actually

00:18:40.933 --> 00:18:42.167
three gods.

00:18:44.567 --> 00:18:47.500
How could God be both
one and three?

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:53.000
Also, people who worried about
the physicality of Christ--

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.667
Christ becomes flesh,
dies, suffers--

00:18:56.667 --> 00:19:02.467
how can God be God if
he dies and suffers?

00:19:02.467 --> 00:19:06.600
Arianism, you have to take
seriously as something that is

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.033
not just troubling the
intellectuals.

00:19:10.033 --> 00:19:13.500
It is not just something for
people with a lot of time and

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.033
leisure on their hands.

00:19:15.033 --> 00:19:17.900
It's not for philosophy
majors.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.633
It's not even for religious
studies majors.

00:19:20.633 --> 00:19:22.333
It's not even for the Roman

00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:24.867
equivalent of college graduates.

00:19:24.867 --> 00:19:26.467
The barbarians--

00:19:26.467 --> 00:19:30.667
and I deliberately avoid
calling them the German

00:19:30.667 --> 00:19:31.400
barbarians--

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.300
but the first barbarians to
convert to this religion were

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.933
more or less--

00:19:37.933 --> 00:19:40.467
and as time goes, on historians
emphasize less--

00:19:40.467 --> 00:19:43.900
but more or less Germanic
tribes.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.767
The missionaries who converted
them were Arians in the

00:19:48.767 --> 00:19:52.467
mid-fourth century, which is the
high tide of Arianism in

00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:54.133
the Roman Empire.

00:19:54.133 --> 00:19:58.667
When the German tribes or the
barbarian tribes entered the

00:19:58.667 --> 00:20:04.567
Empire beginning in the 370s,
Arianism was all but over

00:20:04.567 --> 00:20:08.000
within the Empire.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.533
The Council of Nicaea in the
320s and the Council of

00:20:15.533 --> 00:20:22.500
Constantinople in 381 pretty
much defined Arianism as a

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:28.833
heresy, and by 381, it was
on the run in the Empire.

00:20:28.833 --> 00:20:35.000
But ironically, the new rulers
of the West would be mostly

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.500
Arians well into the
fifth and, in some

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.667
cases, sixth centuries.

00:20:42.667 --> 00:20:45.000
Donatism, or the Donatists.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.600
The Donatists--

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.000
here we're not dealing with
doctrine or metaphysical

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.933
questions of the relationship of
the persons of the Trinity.

00:20:51.933 --> 00:20:57.533
We're dealing with the nature
of the priesthood, hence the

00:20:57.533 --> 00:20:58.767
nature of the church.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.200
It's a question of the
office or the man.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.000
If it turns out that I do not
have a Ph.D. from the

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.133
University of California,
Berkeley, or indeed that I am

00:21:12.133 --> 00:21:18.133
an impostor, that somehow I
tricked the Yale computer,

00:21:18.133 --> 00:21:22.433
have been showing up here,
teaching History 210, and am

00:21:22.433 --> 00:21:24.933
just some random guy--

00:21:24.933 --> 00:21:29.533
like the guy who is obsessed
with the New York City transit

00:21:29.533 --> 00:21:36.200
and has gotten various passes to
get in to drive trains and

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.833
maintenance yards and stuff like
that-- if I turn out to

00:21:38.833 --> 00:21:41.933
be like that, you will
nevertheless get credit for

00:21:41.933 --> 00:21:45.333
this course, I assure you.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:57.200
Because Yale, as an official
body, is the one who grants

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.567
your degree, gives you credits,
and they were

00:22:00.567 --> 00:22:02.400
responsible for hiring me.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.533
So if I've imposed a
fraud on them, you

00:22:04.533 --> 00:22:06.100
nevertheless receive credit.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.867
You don't have to do a
background search of me.

00:22:09.867 --> 00:22:14.667
You don't have to find out about
how many pets I have or

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:19.433
my credit status or my mortgage,
because you rely on

00:22:19.433 --> 00:22:21.200
Yale to do that.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.100
Think of this then in terms
of the priesthood.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.967
If it turns out that the priest
is not a nice guy-- and

00:22:28.967 --> 00:22:32.533
alas, that happens--

00:22:32.533 --> 00:22:35.000
or a sinner--

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.300
or what the Donatists really
cared about was he had buckled

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.000
under threat of torture or the
reality of torture during the

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.200
persecution of Diocletian and
had, say, burned the scripture

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.633
or renounced Christianity--

00:22:50.633 --> 00:22:58.300
if your priest is bad, is
your baby baptized?

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:03.033
That's what Donatism is about,
and Donatism answers, no.

00:23:03.033 --> 00:23:03.500
No.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.433
It depends on the virtue
of the officiate.

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:08.667
You can't have a priest
who was what

00:23:08.667 --> 00:23:12.400
they called a traditor.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.767
Traditor is an interesting Latin
word, T-R-A-D-I-T-O-R,

00:23:15.767 --> 00:23:17.933
because it means both
"tradition"--

00:23:17.933 --> 00:23:21.200
or is the root of the word
"tradition," but also of

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.333
"traitor." It's the handing
down or handing over of

00:23:26.333 --> 00:23:28.500
something, the giving
up of something.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.933
So one can speak of the
handing down of--

00:23:31.933 --> 00:23:35.000
our family has cranberry sauce
with slivered almonds, that's

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.933
our tradition--

00:23:36.933 --> 00:23:41.600
or handing over state secrets,
military strategy, or the

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.400
scripture to the authorities.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.800
The Donatists accused priests
who had or they believed had

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.433
capitulated to Roman
persecutorial pressure in the

00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:55.233
last years of Diocletian.

00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:57.867
They branded them as traitors,
and they said that they could

00:23:57.867 --> 00:23:59.533
not perform legitimate
sacraments.

00:23:59.533 --> 00:24:02.467
Therefore you, in North Africa,
where the Donatists

00:24:02.467 --> 00:24:06.133
were strong, you as an ordinary
Christian had better

00:24:06.133 --> 00:24:10.033
do a background check on your
priest, because your marriage

00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:15.433
is illegitimate, your baby is
going to hell, your whole

00:24:15.433 --> 00:24:17.833
participation in the church
is, as it were,

00:24:17.833 --> 00:24:21.133
short-circuited by
this defect.

00:24:21.133 --> 00:24:25.700
Worse than that, supposing your
priest is just fine--

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.467
in fact, supposing it's 330 AD
and your priest wasn't even

00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:33.300
born during the reign of
Diocletian, but the guy who

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.900
consecrated him, the bishop
who anointed him was a

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.033
traditor, or maybe that bishop
was not, but he was anointed--

00:24:42.033 --> 00:24:46.033
it's like Christmas tree lights,
at least the Christmas

00:24:46.033 --> 00:24:49.767
tree lights that I have,
the analog ones.

00:24:49.767 --> 00:24:55.200
They're little bulbs, and if
one of them goes, the whole

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.600
string goes.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.933
If one is defective--

00:24:59.933 --> 00:25:04.567
the proverbial bad apple rotting
out the entire barrel.

00:25:04.567 --> 00:25:06.967
But the problem with that is
that you can't organize a

00:25:06.967 --> 00:25:11.067
church on that basis, you can't
organize a body spread

00:25:11.067 --> 00:25:14.567
from one corner of the world to
another, unless you believe

00:25:14.567 --> 00:25:17.600
that the church will guarantee
the sanctity of

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.000
the individual minister.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.967
The office, the fact that the
guy is a priest, has to be

00:25:22.967 --> 00:25:25.633
more important than the man,
or else you can only have

00:25:25.633 --> 00:25:26.600
local communities.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.700
You can only trust, if you're a
Donatist, somebody you grew

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.600
up with and a community stable
enough where you're confident

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.100
of the ancestry.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:44.033
Donatism lends itself to what we
call "sectarianism." A sect

00:25:44.033 --> 00:25:49.900
is a small, tightly
cohesive group.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.200
It does not lend itself
to a church that is

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.167
universal, big, massive.

00:25:55.167 --> 00:25:59.600
And it also doubts that the
church itself has the power to

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.267
overcome the defects
of its members.

00:26:06.167 --> 00:26:10.033
Now, Manicheans are not exactly
a heresy, but they

00:26:10.033 --> 00:26:12.767
appear in the Confessions, and
they're very important.

00:26:12.767 --> 00:26:18.200
So since we're doing doctrinal
ideas, Manicheanism is a

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.967
teaching about good and evil
that can be applied to other

00:26:21.967 --> 00:26:23.400
religions besides
Christianity.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.333
Manicheanism basically
says that good and

00:26:29.333 --> 00:26:32.933
evil have a real existence.

00:26:32.933 --> 00:26:36.033
There is a war in the universe
between a good

00:26:36.033 --> 00:26:39.467
god and an evil one.

00:26:39.467 --> 00:26:43.733
And this may be applied outside
of Christianity or

00:26:43.733 --> 00:26:45.000
within Christianity.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.133
And within Christianity, the
evil god is the devil, or

00:26:49.133 --> 00:26:52.967
according to the Manicheans of
this period that Augustine for

00:26:52.967 --> 00:26:59.033
a while joined, the god
of the Old Testament.

00:26:59.033 --> 00:27:02.733
Jehovah is the evil god, and the
god of the New Testament,

00:27:02.733 --> 00:27:06.367
the Christian god,
is the good one.

00:27:06.367 --> 00:27:09.300
Jehovah is the one who smites
a lot of people.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.667
Jehovah is the creator god,
because the Manicheans

00:27:12.667 --> 00:27:16.233
believed that matter is evil
and is the source of evil.

00:27:16.233 --> 00:27:19.800
Spirit is good.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.933
The Christian god
created spirit.

00:27:21.933 --> 00:27:24.700
Human beings are imprisoned in
the body, and they have to

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.967
figure out a way to liberate
themselves from the dominion

00:27:27.967 --> 00:27:31.600
of the evil god.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.967
Vegetarianism, for a start,
avoiding flesh.

00:27:40.167 --> 00:27:42.567
But salvation means casting
off the flesh.

00:27:45.533 --> 00:27:47.267
How is this different
from Christianity?

00:27:47.267 --> 00:27:52.333
And doesn't this sound to you
like regular old Christianity,

00:27:52.333 --> 00:27:53.567
mistrust of the flesh?

00:27:56.433 --> 00:28:01.833
The devil is identified
with sexual desire or

00:28:01.833 --> 00:28:04.300
physicality, generally.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.733
Manicheanism is very useful
as an explanation of evil.

00:28:07.733 --> 00:28:10.100
And this may not be something
that keeps you up at night,

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.833
but it will at some point,
intermittently.

00:28:13.833 --> 00:28:15.200
Where does evil come from?

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.933
Why is there so much
evil in the world?

00:28:20.933 --> 00:28:26.200
Why, if God is good, is there
evil in the world?

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.000
Sure, some of that may
just be to test you--

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.533
you lose your job or your
business fails, but you'll get

00:28:32.533 --> 00:28:34.867
a better one--

00:28:34.867 --> 00:28:42.367
but that's not the same as
horrible infant birth

00:28:42.367 --> 00:28:46.633
disabilities, or the death of
people by starvation in the

00:28:46.633 --> 00:28:50.067
thousands, or choose
your evil thing.

00:28:50.067 --> 00:28:51.800
Why does this happen?

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.700
One explanation is that
God didn't cause it.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.833
There's another god.

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:57.200
What's the problem with that?

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.500
Why is Manicheanism
not a bigger--

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.633
I mean, in a way, it is.

00:29:01.633 --> 00:29:04.433
But you will travel far
to meet anyone who

00:29:04.433 --> 00:29:05.700
says they're a Manichean.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.567
STUDENT: They think God's
not omnipotent.

00:29:11.567 --> 00:29:13.133
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
first of all, then God's not

00:29:13.133 --> 00:29:19.800
all powerful, and so
then how is He God?

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.567
And then instinctively,
what's another

00:29:22.567 --> 00:29:26.133
problem, maybe, with it?

00:29:26.133 --> 00:29:27.033
I could say, so what?

00:29:27.033 --> 00:29:28.400
God is limited.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.633
You know, he's trying.

00:29:33.333 --> 00:29:37.000
Anybody else have a sense of the
moral problem of saying,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.267
the devil made me do it?

00:29:39.267 --> 00:29:41.600
STUDENT: It takes away self--

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.367
PROFESSOR: It takes
away individual

00:29:43.367 --> 00:29:45.300
responsibility.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.667
I didn't cheat those
investors.

00:29:46.667 --> 00:29:49.233
The devil cheated them.

00:29:49.233 --> 00:29:54.000
I didn't mug that Ezra
Stiles student.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.267
The devil did.

00:29:58.267 --> 00:29:59.600
Anyway, this is a debate.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.600
I'm not asking you to take
sides, but notice in the

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.700
Confessions the attitude of
Augustine towards his

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.133
Manichean experience.

00:30:07.133 --> 00:30:13.367
So the fourth century is a
time of ideas circulating

00:30:13.367 --> 00:30:17.433
around as Christianity starts
to define itself.

00:30:17.433 --> 00:30:21.700
This would merely be a chapter
of the history of ideas, were

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.533
it not that the Roman emperors
had to intervene to settle

00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:30.400
many of these issues.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.933
So just forgive me if I am
beating a dead horse, but

00:30:33.933 --> 00:30:37.700
heresy is important because of
its impact in shaping the

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:42.100
church through controversy and
because it fell to the emperor

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.567
to try to resolve heresy.

00:30:45.567 --> 00:30:49.100
And thus marks the beginning
of a merger of church and

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.400
state in a way that would become
characteristic of the

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.900
entire Middle Ages.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:59.467
The other thing to remark is
that the emperor did not have

00:30:59.467 --> 00:31:04.100
a lot of success with
this, almost ever.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.300
It's very frustrating for an
emperor who can get someone

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.800
killed immediately.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.000
All he's got to do is say,
"You dropped that lark's

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.600
tongue pie.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:21.333
Take him away and kill him." But
he can't seem to do this

00:31:21.333 --> 00:31:24.967
with heretics, partly because
heretics love persecution.

00:31:24.967 --> 00:31:26.200
It just toughens them.

00:31:29.467 --> 00:31:34.633
So you have the Prefect of
Africa writing to Jones

00:31:34.633 --> 00:31:35.600
[correction: to Constantine as
you've read in the jones book]

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.800
and saying that this bishop in
North Africa, Caecilian, has

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.233
been attacked as a traditor.

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:45.333
And Constantine does what
emperors usually do, they

00:31:45.333 --> 00:31:47.100
appoint local judges
as experts.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:51.167
They say, go and have a hearing
and find out what's

00:31:51.167 --> 00:31:55.533
going on, and make a
recommendation to me.

00:31:55.533 --> 00:31:57.567
He makes a recommendation
telling the Donatists to go

00:31:57.567 --> 00:31:58.333
home and shut up.

00:31:58.333 --> 00:31:58.900
They don't.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.000
They appeal to the emperor.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.700
The emperor says, "Go home and
shut up." And they don't.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.667
They defy the emperor himself.

00:32:08.667 --> 00:32:11.233
They go back to North Africa,
and they continue preaching

00:32:11.233 --> 00:32:14.767
against traitors.

00:32:14.767 --> 00:32:17.333
Constantine, why does
he intervene?

00:32:17.333 --> 00:32:21.400
Why didn't he just say,
the hell with you--

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.533
pretty literally--

00:32:22.533 --> 00:32:25.667
or, it's a matter of opinion,
or, this doesn't get at the

00:32:25.667 --> 00:32:29.100
core the faith?

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.467
STUDENT: He's afraid
of upsetting God.

00:32:31.467 --> 00:32:32.033
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:32:32.033 --> 00:32:33.200
He's afraid of upsetting God.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.667
Remember, we said that
Constantine was not much of a

00:32:35.667 --> 00:32:38.333
philosopher, not much
of a contemplative.

00:32:38.333 --> 00:32:41.667
He had won a battle with the
favor of the Christian God.

00:32:41.667 --> 00:32:44.233
Now the Christian God--

00:32:44.233 --> 00:32:46.300
he was the companion of
the Christian God.

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.167
The Christian God has
him by the hand.

00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:52.567
If the church starts dissolving
into quarreling

00:32:52.567 --> 00:32:55.900
factions, God is going
to be angry, and

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.467
his favor will cease.

00:32:59.467 --> 00:33:02.600
We have to take the ruler's
anxiety about

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.500
religious unity seriously.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.833
So he changes his policy
several times.

00:33:09.833 --> 00:33:13.500
Remember, we're talking about
a guy who was able to defeat

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:17.500
all his military rivals, sent
Licinius running through Asia

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.633
Minor, caught and
executed him.

00:33:20.633 --> 00:33:22.500
A man of tremendous
capabilities.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.233
Nevertheless, dealing with
these peasants and poor

00:33:26.233 --> 00:33:31.167
townspeople and, from his point
of view, riff-raff who

00:33:31.167 --> 00:33:34.700
were strong in North Africa,
he couldn't get

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.233
them to obey him.

00:33:38.233 --> 00:33:44.200
Sometimes he tried compromise,
then persecution, then just

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.533
saying, nobody can
discuss this.

00:33:46.533 --> 00:33:47.900
And none of this worked.

00:33:50.867 --> 00:33:53.467
Not only did this not work,
but now Arianism came to

00:33:53.467 --> 00:33:55.900
preoccupy him.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.200
And you can see in his letters,
there's a kind of,

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.433
"OMG, I didn't realize
what I was signing up

00:34:02.433 --> 00:34:05.667
for," tone to it.

00:34:05.667 --> 00:34:08.633
At first he was anti-Arian,
pretty totally.

00:34:08.633 --> 00:34:10.767
He saw it as a denial
of Christianity.

00:34:10.767 --> 00:34:15.100
If Christianity by its very name
is that Christ is God,

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:19.200
then Arianism would seem to
be antithetical to that

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.067
fundamental thing.

00:34:20.067 --> 00:34:25.067
So after defeating Licinius,
he learned more about

00:34:25.067 --> 00:34:28.667
Arianism, which was strong in
the East, and his first

00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:31.667
reaction was maybe your
reaction, or certainly the

00:34:31.667 --> 00:34:36.633
reaction of anybody who's more
interested in power, politics,

00:34:36.633 --> 00:34:37.700
this world.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:41.567
He considered it over-subtle,
philosophical,

00:34:41.567 --> 00:34:43.267
and ultimately trivial.

00:34:46.567 --> 00:34:49.333
But he couldn't get rid of it.

00:34:49.333 --> 00:34:52.500
He couldn't get rid of it, and
now, instead of appointing

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:57.467
judges, he summoned a council of
the bishops of the Empire,

00:34:57.467 --> 00:35:00.867
what later would be called
an ecumenical council--

00:35:00.867 --> 00:35:03.033
"ecumenical" meaning
worldwide--

00:35:03.033 --> 00:35:11.600
a universal council, which met
in the city of Nicaea, not

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.600
right across the Bosphorus,
but more or less--

00:35:18.767 --> 00:35:22.200
there's an "a" in there
sometimes--

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:27.300
more or less in the western
part of Asia Minor.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.967
And it met in 325.

00:35:30.967 --> 00:35:33.633
At this first ecumenical
council--

00:35:33.633 --> 00:35:36.133
the last ecumenical council of
the Catholic Church, by the

00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:45.800
way, was in the 1960s, the early
1960s under Pope John--

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.333
and this ecumenical council was
summoned by the emperor,

00:35:49.333 --> 00:35:56.200
and the emperor was in the room
and in certain respects

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.533
presided, intervened,
took sides.

00:35:59.533 --> 00:36:02.200
He was very deferential
to the bishops.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.100
He is not a bishop, after all.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:09.100
He is not a priest. He does
not have the sacramental

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:13.200
orders, but nevertheless, he
was, or attempted to be, the

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.900
boss of this conference.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:21.133
And it came up with a formula,
a definition of the creed,

00:36:21.133 --> 00:36:24.567
what every Christian must
believe, saying that God and

00:36:24.567 --> 00:36:27.800
Christ are of the same essence,

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.300
but different persons.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.667
God and Christ and the Holy
Ghost, who's not really at

00:36:35.667 --> 00:36:37.400
issue yet--

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.400
there will be a heresy involving
the Holy Ghost, but

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.367
not until the end the course--

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:47.200
they are the same essence,
but different persons.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.133
Same essence--

00:36:49.133 --> 00:36:50.967
the Greek word is homoousios.

00:37:00.367 --> 00:37:06.467
Christ was begotten by the
Father, but not made by Him.

00:37:10.733 --> 00:37:13.533
That's a tough one.

00:37:13.533 --> 00:37:14.233
That's a tough one.

00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:18.400
He was begotten by the Father,
but not in time.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:26.133
There wasn't three minutes
after creation.

00:37:26.133 --> 00:37:31.267
Does someone want to go out and
see what that noise is?

00:37:31.267 --> 00:37:33.567
Or is it coming from outside,
and we're hopeless?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.267
Thank you.

00:37:46.833 --> 00:37:50.833
Arius gave a kind of equivocal
acceptance of this

00:37:50.833 --> 00:37:54.400
arrangement, but the Bishop of
Alexandria refused to accept

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.567
Arius back into communion.

00:37:56.567 --> 00:38:02.433
In other words, the Nicene Creed
defined orthodoxy, but

00:38:02.433 --> 00:38:07.067
fighting raged for about 50
years over the relationship

00:38:07.067 --> 00:38:09.567
between Christ and
God the Father.

00:38:09.567 --> 00:38:12.467
Constantine kept on
changing his mind.

00:38:12.467 --> 00:38:15.067
Again, the poor guy
only wanted unity.

00:38:15.067 --> 00:38:19.067
He wanted this to go away so
that God would favor him.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.133
He died more or less an Arian.

00:38:26.133 --> 00:38:31.033
He came to believe that the
Arian moderate position was

00:38:31.033 --> 00:38:34.300
the best. This is partly
because of the absolute

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.300
intransigence of the Bishop
of Alexandria--

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.333
the Archbishop of Alexandria,
Athanasius.

00:38:40.333 --> 00:38:44.867
Athanasius would then later
be a saint, considered the

00:38:44.867 --> 00:38:51.100
upholder of the orthodox line.

00:38:53.867 --> 00:38:59.367
So Constantine was baptized
just before he died.

00:38:59.367 --> 00:39:04.167
In this era, usually, baptism
was supposed to mean that you

00:39:04.167 --> 00:39:06.233
embraced Christianity totally.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.100
It's Augustine, particularly,
who's

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.867
responsible for infant baptism.

00:39:16.867 --> 00:39:20.667
Infant baptism then means you
enter the Christian community,

00:39:20.667 --> 00:39:24.300
but for sure you're
going to sin.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:28.367
The understanding in the 330s
was more, as a baptized

00:39:28.367 --> 00:39:31.967
Christian, I am no
longer a sinner.

00:39:31.967 --> 00:39:35.567
So if you were in an office like
Constantine, where you

00:39:35.567 --> 00:39:40.633
are shedding blood, giving
judgments, leading troops, you

00:39:40.633 --> 00:39:44.367
would wait until your death-bed
moment before

00:39:44.367 --> 00:39:46.033
getting baptized.

00:39:46.033 --> 00:39:50.900
So he would be baptized on his
deathbed by an Arian priest.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.933
What's the danger of this,
parenthetically?

00:39:54.933 --> 00:39:57.300
STUDENT: That you
die unbaptized.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.067
PROFESSOR: Die
unbaptized, right.

00:39:59.067 --> 00:40:03.500
The proverbial bus hitting you
on the street or sudden death

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.900
of another sort.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.400
And we're going to talk--

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.633
I'm sure this is going to be
one of the things you will

00:40:10.633 --> 00:40:12.867
remember with pleasure--

00:40:12.867 --> 00:40:26.667
but briefly about sin, why
people sin, and the

00:40:26.667 --> 00:40:28.733
interaction of good and
evil in human beings.

00:40:28.733 --> 00:40:31.333
Indeed, we're going to start
very soon, because it's all

00:40:31.333 --> 00:40:34.800
over the Confessions.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.133
Let me give you a little bit
of orientation towards the

00:40:38.133 --> 00:40:43.633
Confessions, which I hope you
will read as much as possible.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.567
Why are we reading this
very personal and

00:40:49.567 --> 00:40:50.967
autobiographical work?

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.800
First of all, it is a classic.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.633
How many of you, may I ask,
have already read it?

00:40:59.633 --> 00:41:01.267
A certain number.

00:41:05.467 --> 00:41:09.300
It is an autobiography, which
makes it very unusual.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.233
It's an intimate
autobiography.

00:41:11.233 --> 00:41:15.633
It's not just highlights of
my career or my resume.

00:41:15.633 --> 00:41:20.600
He talks about anxieties,
desires, doubts.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:26.267
It is, therefore, a portrait of
the mentality of a thinking

00:41:26.267 --> 00:41:29.100
person in the ancient world.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:34.567
We get a better idea of the life
of the spirit than from

00:41:34.567 --> 00:41:39.567
many other, most other, almost
any other source.

00:41:39.567 --> 00:41:45.067
It shows the fluidity of the
religious scene in the late

00:41:45.067 --> 00:41:46.600
Roman Empire.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.400
His father is a pagan.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.133
His mother is a Christian.

00:41:50.133 --> 00:41:55.867
He is first a Platonist, sort
of, then a Manichean, then a

00:41:55.867 --> 00:42:00.900
Christian Platonist, and then
a more fervent Christian.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.467
So it shows some of the
religious and philosophical

00:42:05.467 --> 00:42:07.400
options of this era.

00:42:10.233 --> 00:42:15.733
In doing so, we do come across
important and lasting ideas of

00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:22.300
the Western tradition about
evil, sin, body, and soul.

00:42:25.367 --> 00:42:29.333
We also are looking at the
impact of Christianity on the

00:42:29.333 --> 00:42:31.800
Roman Empire and the
relationship between

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.433
Christianity and classical
culture.

00:42:39.533 --> 00:42:42.800
Some things to keep in mind
as you're reading this.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.267
The book is uniquely
self-revealing for its time.

00:42:46.267 --> 00:42:48.733
On the other hand, it doesn't
tell us a lot of stuff we'd

00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:51.267
like to know.

00:42:51.267 --> 00:42:55.967
More time is spent going over
a youthful prank involving

00:42:55.967 --> 00:43:02.533
stealing pears from an orchard
than on Augustine's concubine.

00:43:02.533 --> 00:43:06.667
Concubine: a woman that you're
not married to who's like a

00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:10.033
subordinate with whom you
have a sexual relation.

00:43:10.033 --> 00:43:12.967
And indeed, he would
have a child.

00:43:15.733 --> 00:43:21.933
Pears, Book II, towards
the end, pay a lot of

00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:23.400
attention to that.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.300
The book has a lot of prayers,
quotations from scripture.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.933
It's very Biblically infused.

00:43:28.933 --> 00:43:32.133
Don't be put off by that,
because the book is a

00:43:32.133 --> 00:43:32.900
confession.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.267
"Confession" has two meanings
in this era.

00:43:35.267 --> 00:43:38.267
One is its meaning now, the
way we usually use it,

00:43:38.267 --> 00:43:40.233
confession of sin.

00:43:40.233 --> 00:43:42.233
But it's also a confession
of praise.

00:43:42.233 --> 00:43:48.000
I confess God, meaning I
acknowledge God's power, and I

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.267
praise Him.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:58.967
Finally, I just want to go over
Platonists, because he

00:43:58.967 --> 00:44:03.000
both admires the Platonists,
feels that they saved him from

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.600
the Manicheans, but ultimately
comes to doubt them.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.067
This is described fairly
well in Brown,

00:44:10.067 --> 00:44:12.900
beginning on page 73.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:18.167
But let me just take a few
minutes to discuss this.

00:44:18.167 --> 00:44:22.833
Platonism or Neoplatonism,
it's the same thing.

00:44:22.833 --> 00:44:26.967
Neoplatonism is a religious
Platonism.

00:44:26.967 --> 00:44:31.800
It differs from Plato and his
dialogues by being a little

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:37.600
bit more mystical in the sense
of focused on the One, trying

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:44.367
to apprehend the One, and less
interested in the city, the

00:44:44.367 --> 00:44:47.733
state, or the kinds of
worldly problems

00:44:47.733 --> 00:44:50.867
that Plato dealt with.

00:44:50.867 --> 00:44:55.733
Platonism asserts the
superiority of the spirit and

00:44:55.733 --> 00:44:58.200
the inferiority of matter.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.800
But unlike Manicheanism, which
basically says that matter is

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:07.267
evil and spirit is good,
for the Platonists,

00:45:07.267 --> 00:45:09.600
everything is good.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:15.500
Everything is good, but there
are inferior goods.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.133
So matter is not
evil in itself.

00:45:18.133 --> 00:45:20.800
It's just inferior.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:26.900
Where evil comes from is the
preference of the inferior to

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:32.900
the superior, the preference of
the material manifestation

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.533
to the spiritual.

00:45:34.533 --> 00:45:36.833
So to take the most famous
example-- because we still

00:45:36.833 --> 00:45:39.767
have this little funny vestigial
notion of so-called

00:45:39.767 --> 00:45:42.933
Platonic love--

00:45:42.933 --> 00:45:48.967
love of a sexual sort is
not evil in Platonism.

00:45:48.967 --> 00:45:54.100
What is evil is assuming that
that's all there is and not

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.467
referring it to a higher
spiritual,

00:45:58.467 --> 00:46:03.233
nonmaterial kind of love.

00:46:03.233 --> 00:46:09.900
Wealth is not bad, but the
preference of wealth over

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:14.333
spiritual things is bad.

00:46:14.333 --> 00:46:19.033
Here again, as we spoke at the
beginning of the lecture, it's

00:46:19.033 --> 00:46:22.300
important to emphasize the
superiority of the spiritual

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.033
over the material, because
the spiritual is eternal.

00:46:25.033 --> 00:46:28.400
Evil comes from not realizing
the superiority of the

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.367
material-- of the spiritual,
excuse me--

00:46:30.367 --> 00:46:32.900
or not acting on it, acting
as if the material

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.167
is all there is.

00:46:36.733 --> 00:46:41.200
In Platonism, evil is a falling
away, or a turning of

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:45.367
your vision, to evoke
the cave metaphor.

00:46:45.367 --> 00:46:47.633
It is a misperception,
and it's the

00:46:47.633 --> 00:46:51.500
result of poor education.

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:55.433
If you educate people to the
superiority of the spiritual,

00:46:55.433 --> 00:47:01.067
they will throw off
their evil ways.

00:47:01.067 --> 00:47:06.867
The reason people misbehave,
kill each other, oppress each

00:47:06.867 --> 00:47:12.000
other, is that they don't know
any better, and if you teach

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.400
them, they'll reform.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:22.767
Keep that in mind as we turn to
Augustine and see what he

00:47:22.767 --> 00:47:23.800
thinks about it.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.433
He adores the Platonists because
they're intellectuals.

00:47:27.433 --> 00:47:30.367
He admires them because they
rescued him from the trap of

00:47:30.367 --> 00:47:31.567
Manichean dualism--

00:47:31.567 --> 00:47:35.667
that is, good versus evil,
just simple forces.

00:47:35.667 --> 00:47:39.633
Platonism is an explanation of
evil, but for Augustine, it's

00:47:39.633 --> 00:47:42.267
not a sufficient explanation.

00:47:42.267 --> 00:47:44.700
And that will form part
of the subject

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:46.233
matter of our next talk.

00:47:46.233 --> 00:47:48.433
So I'll see you on Wednesday.

00:47:48.433 --> 00:47:51.333
Oh, and Wednesday, you'll get
the paper topics for the first

00:47:51.333 --> 00:47:53.267
paper, which is due
October 10.

00:47:53.267 --> 00:47:54.500
Thank you.

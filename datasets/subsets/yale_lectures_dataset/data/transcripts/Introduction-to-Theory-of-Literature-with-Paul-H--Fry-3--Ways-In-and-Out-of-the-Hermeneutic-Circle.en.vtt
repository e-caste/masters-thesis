00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.930
Prof: All right.
 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.833
Let's hope we can free our
minds of these matters now and

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:10.110
turn to something a little more
substantive,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.912
which is the question--before
we plunge in to Gadamer really:

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:19.520
what is hermeneutics?
 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.919
Well, what it is is easily
enough explained despite the

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.830
sort of difficulty and
thorniness of the word.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:36.310
It is the art or principles of
interpretation.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.878
But hermeneutics has a history;
that is to say,

00:00:39.878 --> 00:00:43.230
it's not something which has
always just been there.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.736
It's not something that people
have always thought about in a

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:47.730
systematic way.
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.049
Strictly speaking,
what I have just said isn't

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.410
true.
 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.644
Many of you probably know that
Aristotle has a treatise called

00:00:54.644 --> 00:00:56.310
De Interpretatione.
 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.823
The Middle Ages are rife
with treatises on

00:01:00.823 --> 00:01:02.530
interpretation.
 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.399
I suppose what I'm really
saying is that the word

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.090
"hermeneutics"
wasn't available,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.769
and the idea that there ought
to be a sort of a systematic

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:15.450
study of how we interpret things
wasn't really current.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.376
Of course, by the same token
the notion of hermeneutics

00:01:22.376 --> 00:01:27.250
arises primarily in religion
first,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.379
specifically in the Christian
tradition,

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:32.790
but that isn't to say that
there hasn't been,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.783
that there wasn't long before
the moment at which hermeneutics

00:01:36.783 --> 00:01:39.140
became important in
Christianity,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.375
that there wasn't centuries'
worth of Talmudic scholarship

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:49.060
which is essentially also
hermeneutic in nature--

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.507
that is, to say concerned with
the art and basis of

00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:53.680
interpretation.
 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.932
What gave rise in the Western
world to what is called

00:01:57.932 --> 00:02:02.021
"hermeneutics"
was in fact the Protestant

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.328
Reformation.
 

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:06.281
And there's a lot of
significance in that,

00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:09.090
I think, and I'll try to
explain why.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.524
You don't really puzzle your
head about questions of

00:02:13.524 --> 00:02:17.247
interpretation,
how we determine the validity

00:02:17.247 --> 00:02:21.551
of interpretation and so on,
until A) meaning becomes

00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:26.495
terribly important to you,
and B) the ascertainment of

00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:29.020
meaning becomes difficult.
 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.513
You may say to yourself,
"Well, isn't it always the

00:02:31.513 --> 00:02:34.098
case that meaning is important
and that meaning is hard to

00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:34.960
construe?"
 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.620
Well, not necessarily.
 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.967
If you are a person whose
sacred scripture is adjudicated

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:47.699
by the Pope and the occasional
tribunal of church elders,

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:53.132
you yourself don't really need
to worry very much about what

00:02:53.132 --> 00:02:54.789
scripture means.
 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:56.788
You are told what it means.
 

00:02:56.788 --> 00:02:59.568
It goes without saying
therefore what it means.

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:03.817
But in the wake of the
Protestant Reformation when the

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:08.625
question of one's relationship
with the Bible became personal

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:12.763
and everyone was understood,
if only through the local

00:03:12.763 --> 00:03:15.586
minister,
to be engaged with coming to an

00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:19.360
understanding of what is after
all pretty difficult--

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.870
who on earth knows what the
Parables mean and so on,

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.186
and the whole of the Bible
poses interpretative

00:03:25.186 --> 00:03:28.294
difficulties--
then of course you are going to

00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:31.449
have to start worrying about how
to interpret it.

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.444
Needless to say,
since it's a sacred scripture,

00:03:34.444 --> 00:03:37.050
the meaning of it is important
to you.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.660
You do want to know what it
means.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.440
It can't mean just anything.
 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.643
It's crucial to you to know
exactly what it means and why

00:03:44.643 --> 00:03:46.818
what it means is important.
 

00:03:46.818 --> 00:03:52.966
So as Protestantism took hold,
by the same token the arts and

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:56.860
sciences of hermeneutics took
hold,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.060
and people began to write
treatises about interpretation--

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.310
but it was always
interpretation of the Bible.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.282
In other words,
in this tradition religion came

00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:07.800
first.
 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.854
After that, the next thing that
happens is you begin to get the

00:04:11.854 --> 00:04:14.340
rise of constitutional
democracies,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.322
and as you get that,
you begin to become much more

00:04:18.322 --> 00:04:22.387
interested,
as a citizen or as a person who

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:28.057
has suffrage or as a person who
in one way or another has the

00:04:28.057 --> 00:04:33.625
rights of the state or nation--
you begin to become concerned

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:37.279
about the nature of the laws you
live under.

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:42.851
That's why hermeneutics
gradually moved--I should say,

00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:48.632
it didn't desert religion,
but it expanded--to the study

00:04:48.632 --> 00:04:50.209
of the law.
 

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:54.721
The arts and sciences that had
been developed in thinking about

00:04:54.721 --> 00:04:59.377
interpreting scripture were then
applied to the interpretation of

00:04:59.377 --> 00:05:04.180
something the meaning of which
had become almost as important;

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.487
that is to say,
it mattered what the law was

00:05:07.487 --> 00:05:10.180
and how it was to be
interpreted.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.221
You know of course that this is
absolutely crucial to the study

00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:17.285
of the law to this day:
what are the grounds for

00:05:17.285 --> 00:05:20.610
understanding the meaning of the
Constitution,

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.579
for example?
 

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:24.420
There are widespread
controversies about it,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.221
and many of the courses you
would take in law school are

00:05:28.221 --> 00:05:31.540
meant to try to get to the
bottom of these thorny

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.509
questions.
 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.470
Well and good.
 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.350
Once again you see that
hermeneutics enters a field when

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.673
the meaning of something becomes
more important and when that

00:05:44.673 --> 00:05:49.199
meaning is recognized to be
difficult to grasp.

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.860
Now as yet we haven't said
anything about literature,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.023
and the fact is there is no
hermeneutic art devoted to

00:05:59.023 --> 00:06:04.478
literature during the early
modern period and for most of

00:06:04.478 --> 00:06:07.110
the eighteenth century.
 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.767
Think about the writers you've
studied from the eighteenth

00:06:10.767 --> 00:06:11.410
century.
 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.896
It's very interesting that they
all just sort of take meaning

00:06:14.896 --> 00:06:15.709
for granted.
 

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:19.089
If you think about Alexander
Pope,

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:21.360
for example,
or even Samuel Johnson,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.860
as they reflect on literature
and why it's important and what

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.759
the nature of literature is,
they aren't concerned about

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.000
interpretation.
 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.629
They're concerned about
evaluation,

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:39.572
establishing the principles of
what's at stake in writing a

00:06:39.572 --> 00:06:46.394
poem or in writing literature in
some other form and raise

00:06:46.394 --> 00:06:52.379
questions that are largely moral
and esthetic.

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:56.699
They are not concerned about
interpretation because to them,

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.740
good writing is precisely
writing that's clear,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.137
writing that doesn't need to be
interpreted but has precisely as

00:07:06.137 --> 00:07:09.649
its virtue its transparency of
meaning.

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:13.728
In fact, during this whole
period playwrights were writing

00:07:13.728 --> 00:07:18.379
prologues to their plays abusing
each other for being obscure--

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:21.211
that is to say,
abusing each other for

00:07:21.211 --> 00:07:23.278
requiring interpretation.
 

00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:26.639
"I don't understand what
your metaphors are all about.

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:28.519
You don't know what a metaphor
is.

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:33.569
All you do is make one verbal
mistake after another.

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:35.190
Nobody can understand you."
 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:41.184
This is the nature of the prose
and verse prefaces to theatrical

00:07:41.184 --> 00:07:44.610
pieces in the eighteenth
century,

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.026
and from that you can see that
interpretation is not only not

00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:53.591
studied but is considered to be
completely extraneous to what's

00:07:53.591 --> 00:07:55.800
valuable about literature.
 

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.690
If you have to interpret it,
it isn't any good.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.360
Then as the eighteenth century
wears on,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.459
you begin to get the sense--
with the emergence of

00:08:07.459 --> 00:08:11.437
Romanticism,
as is well known and I think

00:08:11.437 --> 00:08:14.922
often overstated--
you begin to get a cult of

00:08:14.922 --> 00:08:15.490
genius.
 

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.677
You get the idea that
everything arises from the

00:08:19.677 --> 00:08:25.021
extraordinary mental acuity or
spiritual insight of an author

00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:29.920
and that what needs to be
understood about literature is

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.038
the genius of its production.
 

00:08:33.038 --> 00:08:36.440
Well, well and good,
but at the same time,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.986
if that's the case,
and if there is this

00:08:38.986 --> 00:08:42.905
extraordinary emphasis on the
importance of the expression of

00:08:42.905 --> 00:08:45.701
genius,
you can see what's beginning to

00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:46.220
happen.
 

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.472
The literary creator starts to
seem a lot more like the divine

00:08:50.472 --> 00:08:52.259
creator,
that is to say,

00:08:52.259 --> 00:08:56.474
and in a certain sense could be
understood as a placeholder for

00:08:56.474 --> 00:08:57.970
the divine creator.
 

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:03.198
Remember that secularization in
Western culture is increasing

00:09:03.198 --> 00:09:06.860
during the course of the
Enlightenment--

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.509
that is to say,
during the course of the

00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:11.431
eighteenth century,
and there's a certain way in

00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:15.626
which Romanticism and what's
important about Romanticism can

00:09:15.626 --> 00:09:19.966
be understood as what Northrop
Frye has called a "secular

00:09:19.966 --> 00:09:21.460
scripture."
 

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.589
In other words,
the meaning of literature

00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:29.282
becomes more difficult because
it's profoundly subjective and

00:09:29.282 --> 00:09:33.740
no longer engaged with the
shared values that had made for

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.489
the importance of literature;
that is to say,

00:09:37.489 --> 00:09:41.124
our sense of why it's so
important to understand it has

00:09:41.124 --> 00:09:43.750
also grown because for many
people,

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:49.460
it begins to take over partly
at least the role of religion.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.129
So with the rise of secular
scripture--

00:09:53.129 --> 00:09:55.571
that is to say,
literature imagined as

00:09:55.571 --> 00:09:59.134
something both terribly
important and also difficult to

00:09:59.134 --> 00:10:02.892
understand--
naturally the arts and sciences

00:10:02.892 --> 00:10:06.639
of hermeneutics begin to enter
that field.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.783
In particular,
the great theologian of the

00:10:09.783 --> 00:10:13.073
Romantic period,
Friedrich Schleiermacher,

00:10:13.073 --> 00:10:16.889
devoted his career to
principles of hermeneutics that

00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:21.585
were meant to be applied as much
to literature as to the study of

00:10:21.585 --> 00:10:25.630
scripture,
and established a tradition in

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:31.181
which it was understood that
literature was a central focus

00:10:31.181 --> 00:10:33.000
of hermeneutics.
 

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.009
So much then for the history of
hermeneutics.

00:10:36.009 --> 00:10:39.971
What followed was the work of
Wilhelm Dilthey around the turn

00:10:39.971 --> 00:10:43.004
of the century,
of Heidegger in his Being

00:10:43.004 --> 00:10:47.740
and Time of 1927,
of Gadamer who in many ways can

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.548
be understood as a disciple and
student of Heidegger;

00:10:52.548 --> 00:10:57.923
and a tradition which persists
today follows from the initial

00:10:57.923 --> 00:11:03.296
engagements of Schleiermacher
during the Romantic period with

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:04.639
literature.
 

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:05.928
All right.
 

00:11:05.928 --> 00:11:10.017
So what is the basic
problematic for hermeneutics in

00:11:10.017 --> 00:11:11.379
this tradition?
 

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:16.495
It's what we probably all have
heard about and something that I

00:11:16.495 --> 00:11:21.282
will briefly try to describe,
what's called the hermeneutic

00:11:21.282 --> 00:11:22.190
circle.
 

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.470
So what is the hermeneutic
circle?

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:29.950
It's a relationship between a
reader and a text or--

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.517
as is the case for certain
kinds of students of

00:11:33.517 --> 00:11:38.138
hermeneutics but not Gadamer,
I think--of a relationship

00:11:38.138 --> 00:11:43.072
between a reader and an author:
in other words a relationship

00:11:43.072 --> 00:11:47.926
which is understood to aim at
understanding the intention of

00:11:47.926 --> 00:11:49.158
an author.
 

00:11:49.158 --> 00:11:53.144
The author of the fourth
quotation on your sheet for

00:11:53.144 --> 00:11:56.895
today, E.D. Hirsch,
belongs in that tradition and

00:11:56.895 --> 00:12:01.505
understands the hermeneutic
circle as a relationship between

00:12:01.505 --> 00:12:06.273
a reader and an author where the
text is a kind of a mediatory

00:12:06.273 --> 00:12:10.649
document containing the meaning
of the author.

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:12.919
But for Gadamer and his
tradition, it's a little

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:13.500
different.
 

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.394
It can be understood as the
relationship between a reader

00:12:17.394 --> 00:12:21.220
and a text, and this can be put
in a variety of ways.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.192
It's often put in terms of the
relationship between the part

00:12:25.192 --> 00:12:26.269
and the whole.
 

00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:31.167
I approach a text and of course
the first thing I read is a

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.110
phrase or a sentence.
 

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.817
There's still a lot more of the
text and so that first fragment

00:12:35.817 --> 00:12:39.166
a part,
but I immediately begin to form

00:12:39.166 --> 00:12:43.875
an opinion about this part with
respect to an imagined or

00:12:43.875 --> 00:12:45.389
supposed whole.
 

00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:51.854
Then, I use this sense I have
of what the whole must be like

00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:56.565
to continue to read successive
parts--lines,

00:12:56.565 --> 00:13:00.509
sentences, whatever they may
be.

00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:05.197
I keep referring those
successive parts back to a sense

00:13:05.197 --> 00:13:10.580
of the whole which changes as a
result of knowing more and more

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.230
and more parts.
 

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:16.594
The circularity of this
interpretative engagement has to

00:13:16.594 --> 00:13:21.355
do with moving back and forth
between a certain preconception

00:13:21.355 --> 00:13:25.639
about the whole that I form from
studying a part,

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:29.000
moving then to the part,
back to the whole,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.912
back to the part,
back to the whole and so on in

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:34.658
a circular pattern.
 

00:13:34.658 --> 00:13:37.936
This can also be understood as
a relationship between the

00:13:37.936 --> 00:13:40.495
present and the past--
that is to say,

00:13:40.495 --> 00:13:44.043
my particular historical
horizon and some other

00:13:44.043 --> 00:13:48.750
historical horizon that I'm
trying to come to terms with,

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:53.376
so that I refer back and forth
to what I know about the world

00:13:53.376 --> 00:13:57.773
before I engage the text;
what the text seems to be

00:13:57.773 --> 00:14:01.658
saying in relation to that which
I know,

00:14:01.658 --> 00:14:05.972
how it might change my sense of
what I know by referring back

00:14:05.972 --> 00:14:10.431
from what I know continuously to
an understanding of the way in

00:14:10.431 --> 00:14:12.658
which the past text speaks.
 

00:14:12.658 --> 00:14:16.144
Finally of course,
because hermeneutics isn't just

00:14:16.144 --> 00:14:20.129
something that takes place
across an historical gulf--

00:14:20.129 --> 00:14:24.434
because it also can take place
across a social or cultural

00:14:24.434 --> 00:14:27.124
gulf,
or maybe not even very much of

00:14:27.124 --> 00:14:29.995
a gulf--
when we engage each other in

00:14:29.995 --> 00:14:32.926
conversation,
we are still performing a

00:14:32.926 --> 00:14:34.100
hermeneutic act.
 

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.918
I have to try to understand
what you're saying and I have to

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:41.458
refer it to what I want to say,
and the circuit of

00:14:41.458 --> 00:14:45.923
communication between us has to
stay open as a result of this

00:14:45.923 --> 00:14:49.495
mutual and developing
understanding of what we're

00:14:49.495 --> 00:14:50.908
talking about.
 

00:14:50.908 --> 00:14:54.375
It's the same thing,
of course, with conversations

00:14:54.375 --> 00:14:55.649
across cultures.
 

00:14:55.649 --> 00:14:59.879
So understand that hermeneutics
isn't necessarily about,

00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:04.110
as Gadamer would put it,
merging historical horizons.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:09.803
It's also about merging social
and cultural and interpersonal

00:15:09.803 --> 00:15:14.549
horizons and it applies to all
of those spheres.

00:15:14.549 --> 00:15:15.370
All right.
 

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:20.576
Now the hermeneutic circle,
then, involves this reference

00:15:20.576 --> 00:15:25.782
back and forth between the
entities that I've been trying

00:15:25.782 --> 00:15:27.269
to describe.
 

00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:31.870
Let's just quickly--and here we
begin to move in to the

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:36.558
text--listen to Gadamer's
version of how the circularity

00:15:36.558 --> 00:15:38.860
of this thinking works.
 

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:44.210
This is on page 722 toward the
bottom of the left-hand column.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.273
The reader [Gadamer's word is
'he']

00:15:48.273 --> 00:15:54.966
projects before himself a
meaning for the text as a whole

00:15:54.966 --> 00:16:01.658
as soon as some initial meaning
emerges in the text.

00:16:01.658 --> 00:16:04.275
[In other words,
as soon as he sees what the

00:16:04.275 --> 00:16:08.347
part is like,
he projects or imagines what

00:16:08.347 --> 00:16:12.995
the whole must be that contains
this part.]

00:16:12.995 --> 00:16:17.090
Again the latter [that is to
say,

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.527
the sense of the initial
meaning]

00:16:19.527 --> 00:16:23.943
emerges only because he is
reading the text with particular

00:16:23.943 --> 00:16:27.600
expectations in regard to a
certain meaning.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.860
The working out of this
fore-project [that is to say,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:38.373
the sense we have in advance of
the meaning of what we are going

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:42.302
to read]
which is constantly revised in

00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:48.610
terms of what emerges as he
penetrates into the meaning,

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.970
is understanding what is there.
 

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.712
In other words,
what is there--which is a kind

00:16:54.712 --> 00:16:58.250
of way of talking that Gadamer
inherits from Heidegger--

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.586
really has to do with what
Gadamer means when he talks also

00:17:02.586 --> 00:17:06.140
about die Sache,
the subject matter.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.190
In other words,
the effort of a reader in

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:14.068
coming to terms with the meaning
of a text is an effort to master

00:17:14.068 --> 00:17:17.179
the subject matter,
what is there,

00:17:17.179 --> 00:17:23.119
and--I suppose it's fair enough
to say as a kind of paraphrase--

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:26.170
what the text is really about.
 

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.179
That's what Gadamer means when
he says "what is

00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:31.278
there."
 

00:17:31.278 --> 00:17:35.058
Anyway, you can see that in
this passage on page 722,

00:17:35.058 --> 00:17:40.460
Gadamer is describing the
circularity of our reading,

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:45.027
and he's describing it in a way
that may raise certain concerns

00:17:45.027 --> 00:17:45.690
for us.
 

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.487
"What do you mean,
a fore-structure or a

00:17:49.487 --> 00:17:52.250
fore-project or a fore-having?
 

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.115
Can't I view this thing,
as we might say,

00:17:55.115 --> 00:17:56.548
objectively?"
 

00:17:56.548 --> 00:17:59.753
In other words,
aren't I going to be hopelessly

00:17:59.753 --> 00:18:03.375
prejudiced about what I read if
I've got some sort of

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:06.858
preliminary conception of what
it's all about?

00:18:06.858 --> 00:18:11.763
Why don't I just set aside my
preliminary conceptions so that

00:18:11.763 --> 00:18:15.278
I can understand precisely what
is there?

00:18:15.278 --> 00:18:18.973
How am I ever going to
understand what is there if I

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:23.249
approach it with some sort of
preliminary idea which I never

00:18:23.249 --> 00:18:27.378
really get rid of because each
revision of what I think is

00:18:27.378 --> 00:18:31.653
there as a result of further
reading nevertheless becomes in

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:36.868
itself yet another fore-project
or preliminary conception?"

00:18:36.868 --> 00:18:39.086
In other words,
this way of thinking seems to

00:18:39.086 --> 00:18:41.155
suggest--
to tell you the truth it does

00:18:41.155 --> 00:18:44.271
suggest--
that you can't get away from

00:18:44.271 --> 00:18:47.788
preliminary conceptions about
things.

00:18:47.788 --> 00:18:50.521
This, of course,
is disturbing and it's

00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:54.837
especially disturbing when you
then get Heidegger and Gadamer

00:18:54.837 --> 00:18:59.153
insisting that even though there
are always these preliminary

00:18:59.153 --> 00:19:02.078
conceptions--
which Gadamer sort of boldly

00:19:02.078 --> 00:19:05.420
calls "prejudices,"
and we'll come back to that--

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.130
even though there are always
these preliminary conceptions,

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.920
there nevertheless are,
as Heidegger puts it,

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.599
two ways into the circle.
 

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:14.368
All right?
 

00:19:14.368 --> 00:19:18.353
A circle, in other words,
is not necessarily a vicious

00:19:18.353 --> 00:19:19.028
circle.
 

00:19:19.028 --> 00:19:21.743
See, that's what you are
tempted to conclude if you say,

00:19:21.743 --> 00:19:24.460
"I can never get away from
preconceptions."

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:24.970
All right?
 

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.887
"I'm just going back and
forth meaninglessly because I'm

00:19:27.887 --> 00:19:29.640
never going to get
anyplace."

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.259
Right?
 

00:19:30.259 --> 00:19:33.079
But Gadamer and Heidegger say,
"No, that's not true.

00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:35.220
That's not true.
 

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.529
A circle isn't at all
necessarily vicious.

00:19:38.529 --> 00:19:43.108
The way into the circle can
also be constructive."

00:19:43.108 --> 00:19:46.404
That is to say,
you really can get someplace,

00:19:46.404 --> 00:19:50.150
and so you're entitled to say,
"Well, okay.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.769
It can be constructive,
but how can that be?"

00:19:53.769 --> 00:19:56.798
Take a look at the second
passage on your sheet from

00:19:56.798 --> 00:19:59.426
Heidegger,
not the whole passage but just

00:19:59.426 --> 00:20:02.400
the first sentence of it where
Heidegger says,

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:08.150
"In an interpretation,
the way in which the entity we

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.946
are interpreting is to be
conceived can be drawn from the

00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:16.761
entity itself,
or the interpretation can force

00:20:16.761 --> 00:20:20.646
the entity into concepts to
which it is opposed in its

00:20:20.646 --> 00:20:22.480
manner of being."
 

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.038
"Now wait a minute,"
you say.

00:20:24.038 --> 00:20:26.836
"If I'm just dealing in
preconceptions here,

00:20:26.836 --> 00:20:30.039
how can I take anything from
the entity itself?"

00:20:30.039 --> 00:20:30.750
Right?
 

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:35.259
That's just what seems to be at
risk if I can never get beyond

00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:36.740
my preconceptions.
 

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.298
Well, let me give you an
example.

00:20:38.298 --> 00:20:40.882
I was going to do this later in
the lecture but I feel like

00:20:40.882 --> 00:20:41.548
doing it now.
 

00:20:41.548 --> 00:20:45.104
In the eighteenth century,
a poet named Mark Akenside

00:20:45.104 --> 00:20:49.480
wrote a long poem called The
Pleasures of the Imagination,

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.914
and in this poem there is
the line "The great creator

00:20:53.914 --> 00:20:56.170
raised his plastic arm."
 

00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:02.730
Now let's say that we're into
polymers.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.288
We know what plastic is.
 

00:21:04.288 --> 00:21:08.790
We have no concern or
hesitation in saying what

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:13.000
plastic is, and so we say,
"Oh, gee.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.005
Well, I guess the great creator
has a sort of a prosthetic limb

00:21:18.005 --> 00:21:19.539
and he raised it.
 

00:21:19.539 --> 00:21:20.098
All right.
 

00:21:20.098 --> 00:21:23.160
So that's what the sentence
must mean."

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.327
But then of course,
if we know something about the

00:21:27.327 --> 00:21:31.920
horizon within which Akenside
was writing his poem,

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.190
we are aware that in the
eighteenth century the word

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.076
"plastic"
meant "sinuous,"

00:21:38.076 --> 00:21:40.769
"powerful,"
"flexible,"

00:21:40.769 --> 00:21:45.361
and in that case of course,
we immediately are able to

00:21:45.361 --> 00:21:50.400
recognize what Akenside meant,
why it makes perfect sense.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.551
The great creator raised his
sinuous, powerful,

00:21:53.551 --> 00:21:56.500
flexible arm,
and we know where we stand.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.470
Now notice this.
 

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.241
In other words,
this is an example of good and

00:22:02.241 --> 00:22:03.660
bad prejudice,
right?

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.817
The good prejudice is our prior
awareness that plastic meant

00:22:08.817 --> 00:22:13.890
something different in the
eighteenth century than it means

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:14.588
now.
 

00:22:14.588 --> 00:22:18.394
And we bring that prejudice to
bear on our interpretation of

00:22:18.394 --> 00:22:21.287
the line,
then that is a constructive way

00:22:21.287 --> 00:22:24.838
into the circle according to
Heidegger and Gadamer.

00:22:24.838 --> 00:22:27.808
The bad prejudice is when we
leap to the conclusion,

00:22:27.808 --> 00:22:30.904
without thinking for a moment
that there might be some other

00:22:30.904 --> 00:22:34.519
historical horizon,
that we know what plastic means.

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:38.779
The reason we can tell the
difference,

00:22:38.779 --> 00:22:43.127
by the way, is that if we
invoke the eighteenth-century

00:22:43.127 --> 00:22:46.433
meaning of plastic,
we immediately see that the

00:22:46.433 --> 00:22:49.482
line makes perfect sense,
that it's perfectly reasonable

00:22:49.482 --> 00:22:51.250
and not even particularly
notable;

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.700
but if we bring our own meaning
to bear--

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.652
that is to say our own sense of
what the word

00:22:56.652 --> 00:22:57.940
"plastic"
means--

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.380
then of course the meaning of
the line must be crazy.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.960
I mean, what on earth?
 

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.420
Why would he be saying this
about the great creator?

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.910
Now I think I'll come back to
this example next week when

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:13.400
we're talking about an essay
called "The Intentional

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.644
Fallacy by
W.K. Wimsatt,"

00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:18.946
and I will revisit the
possibility that there might be

00:23:18.946 --> 00:23:22.685
some value in supposing that
Akenside meant the great creator

00:23:22.685 --> 00:23:28.038
raised his prosthetic limb,
but I'll leave that until next

00:23:28.038 --> 00:23:28.608
week.
 

00:23:28.608 --> 00:23:32.941
I think for the moment it
should be plain to you that this

00:23:32.941 --> 00:23:37.423
is a good way of understanding
what the difference between a

00:23:37.423 --> 00:23:41.832
useful preconception and a
useless preconception brought to

00:23:41.832 --> 00:23:45.859
bear on an interpretative act
might consist in.

00:23:45.859 --> 00:23:46.348
All right.
 

00:23:46.348 --> 00:23:51.039
Now in giving the example,
I've gotten a little bit ahead

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:54.140
of myself, so let me reprise a
bit.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.308
As you can tell from your
reading of Gadamer--

00:23:57.308 --> 00:23:59.757
and of course,
the title of the great book

00:23:59.757 --> 00:24:03.576
from which this excerpt is taken
is Truth and Method or

00:24:03.576 --> 00:24:06.528
Wahrheit und Methode,
with its implicit

00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:10.126
suggestion that there is a
difference between truth and

00:24:10.126 --> 00:24:13.339
method--
the great objection of Gadamer

00:24:13.339 --> 00:24:17.886
to other people's way of doing
hermeneutics is that they

00:24:17.886 --> 00:24:22.598
believe that there is a
methodology of interpretation.

00:24:22.598 --> 00:24:27.135
The basic methodology Gadamer
is attacking in the excerpt

00:24:27.135 --> 00:24:30.618
you've read is what he calls
historicism.

00:24:30.618 --> 00:24:33.809
Now that's a tricky word for us
because later in the semester

00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:36.734
we're going to be reading about
something called the New

00:24:36.734 --> 00:24:39.304
Historicism,
and the New Historicism

00:24:39.304 --> 00:24:43.792
actually has nothing to do with
what Gadamer is objecting to in

00:24:43.792 --> 00:24:47.519
this form of historicism;
so we will return to the New

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:49.279
Historicism in that context.
 

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:51.911
For the moment,
what Gadamer means by

00:24:51.911 --> 00:24:55.637
"historicism"
is this: the belief that you

00:24:55.637 --> 00:25:00.354
can set aside preconception,
in other words that you can

00:25:00.354 --> 00:25:04.278
completely factor out your own
subjectivity,

00:25:04.278 --> 00:25:07.070
your own view of things,
your own historically

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.866
conditioned point of view--
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have

00:25:09.866 --> 00:25:11.383
said "historically
conditioned,"

00:25:11.383 --> 00:25:15.567
I mean your own point of view--
that you can completely factor

00:25:15.567 --> 00:25:21.521
that out in order to enter into
the mindset of some other time

00:25:21.521 --> 00:25:26.597
or place: that you can
completely enter into the mind

00:25:26.597 --> 00:25:28.160
of another.
 

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:34.858
This then is the object of
historicizing and,

00:25:34.858 --> 00:25:36.430
as we'll see at the end of the
lecture,

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.480
there's a certain nobility
about it to be juxtaposed with

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.519
the nobility of Gadamerian
hermeneutics.

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:46.545
In the meantime,
Gadamer is objecting to this

00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:49.568
because he says,
you simply can't do this.

00:25:49.568 --> 00:25:53.298
You cannot factor out these
preconceptions.

00:25:53.298 --> 00:25:58.519
All you can do,
he says, is recognize that you

00:25:58.519 --> 00:26:01.038
do exist in,
you do live in,

00:26:01.038 --> 00:26:03.740
you do think consciously within
a certain horizon,

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.633
recognize that you are coming
face-to-face with another

00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:12.602
horizon,
and try to bridge your horizon

00:26:12.602 --> 00:26:16.057
and the other horizon--
in other words,

00:26:16.057 --> 00:26:19.078
to put it simply,
to find common ground,

00:26:19.078 --> 00:26:24.741
to find some way of merging a
present with a past:

00:26:24.741 --> 00:26:30.023
a here with a there,
in such a way that results in

00:26:30.023 --> 00:26:34.549
what Gadamer calls
Horizontverschmelzung,

00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:36.380
"horizon merger."
 

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:41.967
This act of horizon merger has
as its result what Gadamer calls

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:46.653
"effective history,"
and by "effective

00:26:46.653 --> 00:26:50.077
history"
he means history which is

00:26:50.077 --> 00:26:52.374
useful--
that is to say,

00:26:52.374 --> 00:26:56.444
history which really can go to
work for us and is not just a

00:26:56.444 --> 00:27:00.308
matter of accumulating an
archive or distancing ourselves

00:27:00.308 --> 00:27:01.618
from the past.
 

00:27:01.618 --> 00:27:04.643
I'll say again,
somewhat in advance perhaps of

00:27:04.643 --> 00:27:07.934
the time I should say it,
that Gadamer thinks that

00:27:07.934 --> 00:27:11.160
there's something immoral about
historicism.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:11.700
Why?
 

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.470
Because it condescends toward
the past.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:19.653
It supposes that the past is
simply a repository of

00:27:19.653 --> 00:27:22.997
information,
and it never supposes for a

00:27:22.997 --> 00:27:27.943
minute that if we actually merge
ourselves with the moment of the

00:27:27.943 --> 00:27:30.923
past,
the past may be able to tell us

00:27:30.923 --> 00:27:34.271
something we ought to know--
that is to say,

00:27:34.271 --> 00:27:38.068
it may be able actually to
teach us something.

00:27:38.068 --> 00:27:42.116
Gadamer believes that
historicism forgets the

00:27:42.116 --> 00:27:46.902
possibility of being taught
something by past-ness or

00:27:46.902 --> 00:27:48.190
otherness.
 

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:52.721
Now I think in order to make
this viewpoint seem plausible,

00:27:52.721 --> 00:27:57.176
we probably should study it for
a moment a little bit more

00:27:57.176 --> 00:27:58.740
philosophically.
 

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.480
That is to say,
you're asking yourself,

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.849
"Well, sure.
 

00:28:02.849 --> 00:28:03.730
You know what?
 

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:10.505
I pride myself on this:
I can factor out all forms of

00:28:10.505 --> 00:28:12.460
subjectivity.
 

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.410
I really can be objective.
 

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:18.550
I'm perfectly capable of
understanding the past in and

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:22.380
for itself without any
contribution of my own,

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.509
without, in short,
any preconceptions."

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:29.328
So let's look at a couple of
passages from your sheet,

00:28:29.328 --> 00:28:31.568
from Heidegger's Being and
Time,

00:28:31.568 --> 00:28:33.900
from his analytic of the
hermeneutic circle,

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:39.130
and see what Heidegger has to
say about this claim.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.839
This is the first passage on
your sheet.

00:28:42.839 --> 00:28:45.884
Heidegger says:
When we have to do with

00:28:45.884 --> 00:28:51.048
anything, the mere seeing of the
things which are closest to us

00:28:51.048 --> 00:28:55.711
bears in itself the structure of
interpretation and in so

00:28:55.711 --> 00:29:00.710
primordial a manner that just to
grasp something free,

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.147
as it were, of the
"as"

00:29:03.147 --> 00:29:05.740
requires a certain
adjustment...

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.858
What is Heidegger saying?
 

00:29:06.858 --> 00:29:12.853
He is saying,
I stand here and I am just

00:29:12.853 --> 00:29:14.390
looking.
 

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:19.971
I look back there and I'm just
seeing that sign that says

00:29:19.971 --> 00:29:20.869
'exit'.
 

00:29:20.869 --> 00:29:22.480
I'm not interpreting it.
 

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.690
I don't have any preconception
about it.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.890
I'm just looking.
 

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:27.180
Right?
 

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.349
No, Heidegger says,
this is a total illusion.

00:29:30.349 --> 00:29:32.339
How do I know it's a sign?
 

00:29:32.339 --> 00:29:33.970
How do I know it says 'exit'?
 

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:38.431
I bring a million
preconceptions to bear on what I

00:29:38.431 --> 00:29:41.798
take to be a simple act of
looking.

00:29:41.798 --> 00:29:44.980
And then Heidegger says,
you know what?

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.029
It's not at all uninteresting
to imagine the possibility of

00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:52.868
just seeing something without
seeing it as something.

00:29:52.868 --> 00:29:55.296
It would be kind of
exhilarating,

00:29:55.296 --> 00:29:57.950
wouldn't it,
to be able just to have

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:59.769
something before us.
 

00:29:59.769 --> 00:30:00.680
Right?
 

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.420
But he says,
"You know what?

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.818
That is well nigh impossible.
 

00:30:04.818 --> 00:30:10.078
It is in fact a very,
very difficult and derivative

00:30:10.078 --> 00:30:16.810
act of the mind to try to forget
that I am looking at a sign that

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:21.888
says 'exit' and,
in fact, just looking at what

00:30:21.888 --> 00:30:25.548
is there without knowing what it
is.

00:30:25.548 --> 00:30:27.682
In other words,
I don't not know first

00:30:27.682 --> 00:30:30.009
that that's a sign that says
"exit."

00:30:30.009 --> 00:30:33.234
The very first thing I know is
that it's a sign that says

00:30:33.234 --> 00:30:34.328
"exit."
 

00:30:34.328 --> 00:30:37.038
There's no prior act of
consciousness.

00:30:37.038 --> 00:30:39.779
It's the very first thing that
I know.

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:43.327
It's an interesting thought
experiment to try not to know

00:30:43.327 --> 00:30:46.368
that that's a sign that says
"exit."

00:30:46.368 --> 00:30:50.726
As Heidegger points out in this
passage, that's a thought

00:30:50.726 --> 00:30:53.992
experiment which,
if it can be done at all,

00:30:53.992 --> 00:30:56.950
derives from that prior
knowledge.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:00.970
I always know something first
as something.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.598
If I can just have it there
before me,

00:31:04.598 --> 00:31:11.009
that is a very difficult and
derivative intellectual act,

00:31:11.009 --> 00:31:15.598
and it cannot be understood as
primordial or primitive.

00:31:15.598 --> 00:31:20.717
I am always already in
possession of an interpretation

00:31:20.717 --> 00:31:26.413
of whatever object I look at,
which isn't at all to say that

00:31:26.413 --> 00:31:29.598
my interpretation is correct.
 

00:31:29.598 --> 00:31:33.038
It's only to say that I can't
escape the fact that the very

00:31:33.038 --> 00:31:36.039
first movement of mind,
not the last movement but the

00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:38.279
first movement of mind,
is interpretative.

00:31:38.279 --> 00:31:39.420
Right?
 

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:44.006
We always see something as
something, and that is precisely

00:31:44.006 --> 00:31:46.220
the act of interpretation.
 

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.017
We can never just have it there
before us or,

00:31:50.017 --> 00:31:53.728
as I say, if we can--if we
can--it's a very,

00:31:53.728 --> 00:31:57.180
very difficult act of
concentration.

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:01.076
Continue the passage:
"This grasping which is

00:32:01.076 --> 00:32:05.930
free of the 'as' is a privation
of the kind of seeing [and you

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:10.463
see how attracted Heidegger is
to it because he shifts his

00:32:10.463 --> 00:32:12.691
rhetoric]
in which one merely

00:32:12.691 --> 00:32:14.759
understands."
 

00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:17.297
In other words,
It would be an extraordinary

00:32:17.297 --> 00:32:20.069
thing not to understand,
Heiddeger is saying.

00:32:20.069 --> 00:32:23.150
We can't help understanding.
 

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:27.198
We always already understand,
which has nothing to do again

00:32:27.198 --> 00:32:30.200
with whether or not we're right
or wrong.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:35.108
We always already just
necessarily do understand.

00:32:35.108 --> 00:32:37.554
It's a kind of imprisonment,
understanding,

00:32:37.554 --> 00:32:40.522
and when Heidegger says,
wouldn't it be great not to

00:32:40.522 --> 00:32:42.269
have to merely understand?
 

00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:45.727
right, he's saying,
wouldn't it be great just to

00:32:45.727 --> 00:32:47.640
have it there before us?
 

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.221
but he's also insisting that
this is an incredibly difficult,

00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:55.200
if not impossible,
moment of thought.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.220
All right.
 

00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:02.460
So that's why--and this is
perhaps the essential,

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.619
the central passage,
and I don't want to pause over

00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:06.557
it--
but you can look at passage

00:33:06.557 --> 00:33:10.075
number three on your sheet,
which says roughly again what

00:33:10.075 --> 00:33:12.618
Heidegger is saying in the first
passage--

00:33:12.618 --> 00:33:17.671
that's why we must work always
as interpreters with

00:33:17.671 --> 00:33:21.240
preconceptions,
with fore-understandings.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.710
Now what about this word
"prejudice"?

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:26.130
It is a sort of a problematic
word.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.701
Gadamer is a bit apologetic
about it, and he goes into the

00:33:29.701 --> 00:33:31.328
appropriate etymologies.
 

00:33:31.328 --> 00:33:33.400
The French
préjugé

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.958
and the German
Voruteil all mean

00:33:35.958 --> 00:33:39.490
"prejudgment"
or "prior judgment."

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:44.268
They actually can be used in a
court of law as a stage toward

00:33:44.268 --> 00:33:46.180
arriving at a verdict.
 

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.654
They needn't be thought of as
vulgar prejudices,

00:33:48.654 --> 00:33:51.287
one of which is in fact the
"prejudice against

00:33:51.287 --> 00:33:52.338
prejudice."
 

00:33:52.338 --> 00:33:55.868
As Gadamer says,
this is the characteristic idea

00:33:55.868 --> 00:33:59.022
of the Enlightenment:
its prejudice against

00:33:59.022 --> 00:34:01.934
prejudice,
that we can be objective,

00:34:01.934 --> 00:34:05.630
that we can free ourselves of--
Okay, fine.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:13.159
But prejudice is bad,
we know prejudice is bad.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:17.141
We know what prejudice has
wrought historically and

00:34:17.141 --> 00:34:21.760
socially, so how can we try to
vindicate it in this way?

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.469
It's extremely problematic.
 

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:27.110
What Gadamer does in his essay
is actually an act of

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:30.750
intellectual conservatism,
it has to be admitted.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:33.989
That whole section of the essay
in which he talks about

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.715
classicism--
and you may have said to

00:34:35.715 --> 00:34:37.541
yourself as you were reading it,
"Well, gee,

00:34:37.541 --> 00:34:38.650
isn't this sort of digressive?
 

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:41.349
What's he so interested in
classicism for?"--

00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:44.891
the whole section of the essay
in which he's talking about

00:34:44.891 --> 00:34:48.559
classicism and which he later
calls "tradition"

00:34:48.559 --> 00:34:53.135
is meant to suggest that we
really can't merge horizons

00:34:53.135 --> 00:34:58.134
effectively unless we have a
very broad and extensive common

00:34:58.134 --> 00:35:01.099
ground with what we're reading.
 

00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:03.891
The great thing about
classicism for Gadamer,

00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:06.302
or what he calls
"tradition,"

00:35:06.302 --> 00:35:08.840
is that it's something we can
share.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.818
The classical,
Gadamer argues,

00:35:10.818 --> 00:35:14.434
is that which doesn't just
speak to its own historical

00:35:14.434 --> 00:35:18.293
moment but speaks for all time,
speaks to all of us in

00:35:18.293 --> 00:35:20.719
different ways but does speak to
us--

00:35:20.719 --> 00:35:24.538
that is to say,
does proffer its claim to speak

00:35:24.538 --> 00:35:25.119
true.
 

00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:27.920
The classical can do that.
 

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.280
"Okay, great,"
we say to Gadamer.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.119
"Certainly you're entitled
to an intellectually

00:35:34.119 --> 00:35:35.699
conservative canon.
 

00:35:35.699 --> 00:35:38.690
Maybe other principles of
hermeneutics will place much

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.739
more stress on innovation or
novelty or difference,

00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:45.601
but you're not sure people can
understand unless they share a

00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:47.920
great deal of common
ground."

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.980
All well and good,
but you know what?

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.610
That's where the bad side of
prejudice sneaks in.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:56.581
Slavery was considered
perfectly appropriate and

00:35:56.581 --> 00:36:01.485
natural to a great many of the
most exalted figures working

00:36:01.485 --> 00:36:05.373
within the tradition that
Gadamer rightly calls

00:36:05.373 --> 00:36:07.929
classical--
classical antiquity.

00:36:07.929 --> 00:36:12.014
A great many modern figures
never stopped to question

00:36:12.014 --> 00:36:12.800
slavery.
 

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.132
Slavery was an aspect of
classical culture which had its

00:36:18.132 --> 00:36:19.199
defenses.
 

00:36:19.199 --> 00:36:22.130
Well, Gadamer doesn't talk
about this obviously,

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:27.106
but it is an aspect of that
prejudice that one might share

00:36:27.106 --> 00:36:32.431
with tradition if one weren't
somewhat more critical than this

00:36:32.431 --> 00:36:35.750
gesture of sharing might
indicate.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:40.802
I just say that in passing to
call your attention to it as a

00:36:40.802 --> 00:36:45.599
risk that's involved in our
engagement with a hermeneutic

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:48.940
project of the nature of
Gadamer's.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.461
It's not to say that Gadamer
favored slavery or anything of

00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:54.320
the sort.
 

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.409
It is, however,
to say that prejudice--

00:36:58.409 --> 00:37:03.019
while plainly we can understand
it simply to mean preconception

00:37:03.019 --> 00:37:06.217
which is inescapable and can
understand that

00:37:06.217 --> 00:37:10.559
philosophically--
nevertheless can still be bad.

00:37:10.559 --> 00:37:15.074
We have to understand the way
in which it's something that,

00:37:15.074 --> 00:37:18.422
if we're going to accept this
point of view,

00:37:18.422 --> 00:37:20.369
we need to live with.
 

00:37:20.369 --> 00:37:21.550
All right.
 

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:26.541
So it is troublesome,
and it's troublesome also,

00:37:26.541 --> 00:37:32.809
perhaps, in a variety of other
ways that I won't go into.

00:37:32.809 --> 00:37:37.168
I think that what I'd like to
do in the time remaining is to

00:37:37.168 --> 00:37:40.050
call your attention to two
passages,

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:44.972
one in Gadamer's text which I'm
about to read and the other the

00:37:44.972 --> 00:37:49.577
fourth passage on your sheet by
someone called E.D. Hirsch,

00:37:49.577 --> 00:37:54.182
whom you may actually know as
the author of a dictionary of

00:37:54.182 --> 00:37:59.105
what every school child should
know and as a sort of a champion

00:37:59.105 --> 00:38:04.027
of the intellectual right during
the whole period when literary

00:38:04.027 --> 00:38:08.501
theory flourished,
but a person who also is

00:38:08.501 --> 00:38:12.610
seriously invested in
hermeneutics and conducted a

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:18.230
lifelong feud with Gadamer about
the principles of hermeneutics.

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:23.190
The two passages that I'm about
to read juxtapose the viewpoints

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:27.365
that I've been trying to evoke
in describing Gadamer's

00:38:27.365 --> 00:38:28.389
position.
 

00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:33.813
The dignity and nobility of
Gadamer is that it involves

00:38:33.813 --> 00:38:37.630
being interested in something
true--

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.489
that is to say,
in hoping that there is an

00:38:40.489 --> 00:38:43.349
intimate relationship between
meaning,

00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:49.061
arriving at meaning,
and arriving at something that

00:38:49.061 --> 00:38:51.690
speaks to us as true.
 

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:55.132
Hirsch, on the other hand,
is evoking a completely

00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:57.099
different kind of dignity.
 

00:38:57.099 --> 00:39:01.356
What I want you to realize as
we juxtapose these two passages

00:39:01.356 --> 00:39:04.619
is that it is impossible to
reconcile them,

00:39:04.619 --> 00:39:08.300
and it poses for us a choice
which,

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.360
as people interested in
interpretation,

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:17.414
needs ultimately to be made and
suggests perhaps differing forms

00:39:17.414 --> 00:39:18.699
of commitment.
 

00:39:18.699 --> 00:39:23.027
Now the first passage is in
Gadamer's text on page 735,

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:27.677
the very bottom of the page,
and then I'll be going over to

00:39:27.677 --> 00:39:28.719
page 736.
 

00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:32.242
Gadamer says,
and here again he's attacking

00:39:32.242 --> 00:39:35.952
historicism:
The text that is understood

00:39:35.952 --> 00:39:40.766
historically is forced to
abandon its claim that it is

00:39:40.766 --> 00:39:43.219
uttering something true.
 

00:39:43.219 --> 00:39:48.503
We think we understand when we
see the past from a historical

00:39:48.503 --> 00:39:51.938
standpoint, i.e.,
place ourselves in the

00:39:51.938 --> 00:39:57.047
historical situation and seek to
reconstruct the historical

00:39:57.047 --> 00:39:58.280
horizon.
 

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.585
[I've been attempting to
summarize this position and so I

00:40:02.585 --> 00:40:06.737
trust that it's easily
intelligible as I read it to you

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.199
now.]
In fact,

00:40:08.199 --> 00:40:12.030
however, we have given up the
claim to find,

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:14.829
in the past,
any truth valid and

00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:17.449
intelligible for ourselves.
 

00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:19.500
And, by the way,
this would also apply to

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.730
cultural conversation.
 

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:25.635
If I'm proud of knowing that in
another culture if I belch after

00:40:25.635 --> 00:40:28.750
dinner it's a compliment to the
cook,

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:32.737
right, and if I'm proud of
knowing that without drawing any

00:40:32.737 --> 00:40:35.905
conclusions from it,
that's sort of the equivalent

00:40:35.905 --> 00:40:36.780
of historicism.
 

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.840
It's just a factoid for me.
 

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.092
In other words,
it's not an effort to come to

00:40:42.092 --> 00:40:43.719
terms with anything.
 

00:40:43.719 --> 00:40:47.380
It's not an effort to engage in
dialogue.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.583
It's just historicizing
otherness in a way that somehow

00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:55.320
or another satisfies my quest
for information.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.097
So it's not just a question of
the past, as I say and as I've

00:40:59.097 --> 00:40:59.980
said before.
 

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:04.329
It's a question of cultural
conversation as well.

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:09.929
Thus, this acknowledgment of
the otherness of the other,

00:41:09.929 --> 00:41:13.389
which makes him the object of
objective knowledge,

00:41:13.389 --> 00:41:18.949
involves the fundamental
suspension of his claim to

00:41:18.949 --> 00:41:19.840
truth.
 

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.329
This is a devastating and,
I think, brilliant argument.

00:41:23.329 --> 00:41:27.943
I think it ought to remind us
of what's at stake when we

00:41:27.943 --> 00:41:30.880
invoke the notion of
objectivity.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:36.943
Implicit, according to Gadamer,
in the notion of objectivity is

00:41:36.943 --> 00:41:42.126
an abandonment of the
possibility of learning from the

00:41:42.126 --> 00:41:45.039
object,
of learning from otherness.

00:41:45.039 --> 00:41:48.489
It only becomes a question of
knowing the object,

00:41:48.489 --> 00:41:51.340
of knowing it in and for
itself, in its own terms,

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:55.780
and not at all necessarily of
learning from it,

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.400
of being spoken to by it.
 

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.969
All right, but now listen to
Hirsch.

00:41:59.969 --> 00:42:00.579
All right?
 

00:42:00.579 --> 00:42:05.699
This is really a hard choice to
make.

00:42:05.699 --> 00:42:06.460
&gt;
 

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:10.085
What Hirsch says,
invoking Kant--rightly invoking

00:42:10.085 --> 00:42:12.929
Kant--
is: "Kant held it to be a

00:42:12.929 --> 00:42:17.556
foundation of moral action that
men should be conceived as ends

00:42:17.556 --> 00:42:20.704
in themselves,
not as instruments of other

00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:21.440
men."
 

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.063
In other words,
you are an end and not a means

00:42:25.063 --> 00:42:28.445
to me unless in fact I'm
exploiting you and

00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:30.539
instrumentalizing you.
 

00:42:30.539 --> 00:42:31.980
Right?
 

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.594
That's Kant's position and
that's what Hirsch is leaping to

00:42:36.594 --> 00:42:37.309
defend.
 

00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:42.380
This idea that I don't really
care,

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:47.463
or that I don't really think I
can come to terms with the

00:42:47.463 --> 00:42:51.639
actual meaning of an entity as
that entity,

00:42:51.639 --> 00:42:54.400
is instrumentalizing the entity.
 

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.818
In other words,
it's approaching it for

00:42:56.818 --> 00:42:57.349
me.
 

00:42:57.349 --> 00:43:01.447
This turns the whole idea of
being open to the possibility

00:43:01.447 --> 00:43:05.619
that the other is speaking
true--it turns it on its ear and

00:43:05.619 --> 00:43:07.130
says, Oh, no,
no.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:09.929
You're just appropriating the
other for yourself.

00:43:09.929 --> 00:43:10.619
Right?
 

00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:12.670
You're instrumentalizing the
other.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:15.239
You're not taking it seriously
as itself.

00:43:15.239 --> 00:43:18.389
That's Hirsch's response.
 

00:43:18.389 --> 00:43:23.538
He continues:
This imperative is transferable

00:43:23.538 --> 00:43:27.894
to the words of men because
speech is an extension and

00:43:27.894 --> 00:43:32.992
expression of men in the social
domain and also because when we

00:43:32.992 --> 00:43:37.349
fail to conjoin a man's
intention to his words,

00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:41.800
we lose the soul of speech,
which is to convey meaning and

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.550
to understand what is intended
to be conveyed.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:49.302
Notice that although the
nobility of this alongside the

00:43:49.302 --> 00:43:52.152
nobility of Gadamer is obvious
and painful

00:43:52.152 --> 00:43:53.960
&gt;
 

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:58.599
and really does seem to bring
us to a crossroads where we

00:43:58.599 --> 00:44:02.673
really want to be Yogi Berra,
right, and go in both

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:05.590
directions--even though this is
the case,

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:06.500
notice one thing.
 

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.860
Hirsch is not saying anything
about truth.

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.000
Right?
 

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.739
He's talking about
meaning--that's good--

00:44:12.739 --> 00:44:17.541
and he's making the notion of
arriving at a correct meaning as

00:44:17.541 --> 00:44:22.483
honorific as he possibly can,
but it is significant that he's

00:44:22.483 --> 00:44:24.440
not talking about truth.
 

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.099
It's Gadamer who is talking
about truth.

00:44:27.099 --> 00:44:29.820
For Hirsch the important thing
is the meaning.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:34.889
For Gadamer the important thing
is that the meaning be true,

00:44:34.889 --> 00:44:39.960
right, and that's where the
distinction essentially lies.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:44.318
Gadamer is willing to sacrifice
because of his belief in the

00:44:44.318 --> 00:44:46.829
inescapability of preconception.
 

00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:50.780
He's willing to sacrifice
historical or cultural

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.800
exactitude of meaning.
 

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.367
He's willing to acknowledge
that there's always something of

00:44:56.367 --> 00:44:59.949
me in my interpretation,
but it's a good something

00:44:59.949 --> 00:45:04.630
because after all I am mindful
of the horizon of otherness.

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:06.454
I am not just saying
"plastic"

00:45:06.454 --> 00:45:08.139
means "polymer,"
right,

00:45:08.139 --> 00:45:11.103
but nevertheless there's
something of me in the

00:45:11.103 --> 00:45:12.199
interpretation.
 

00:45:12.199 --> 00:45:14.998
Hirsch is saying,
"There's nothing of me in

00:45:14.998 --> 00:45:16.250
the interpretation.
 

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:21.797
Therefore, I am able to arrive
accurately and objectively at

00:45:21.797 --> 00:45:26.159
the meaning of the other,
and I honor the other by

00:45:26.159 --> 00:45:29.617
arriving with such accuracy at
the meaning,"

00:45:29.617 --> 00:45:32.860
but notice that truth isn't
backing it up.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:37.065
It doesn't seem to be a
question for Hirsch of whether

00:45:37.065 --> 00:45:38.969
the other speaks true.
 

00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:41.327
This is unfair to Hirsch,
by the way, because truth

00:45:41.327 --> 00:45:42.650
actually is backing it up.
 

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:45.889
All you need to do is read him
and you will recognize that it

00:45:45.889 --> 00:45:48.860
does matter to Hirsch whether
the other speaks true,

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:52.097
but it's not implicit in the
philosophical position he's

00:45:52.097 --> 00:45:53.099
taking up here.
 

00:45:53.099 --> 00:45:55.581
It's something that the
philosophical position

00:45:55.581 --> 00:45:56.300
sacrifices.
 

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.170
Okay.
 

00:45:58.170 --> 00:45:59.730
So that's the basic distinction
and,

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:04.010
as I say, as far as I can see
it's irreconcilable so it leaves

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:07.730
us with a choice that really
does have to be made,

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:12.373
and it's a choice which looms
over a course in literary theory

00:46:12.373 --> 00:46:16.940
and coming to understand the
tradition of literary theory.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.719
Some will take one side,
others will take another,

00:46:19.719 --> 00:46:24.159
and we'll find ourselves siding
or not siding with them,

00:46:24.159 --> 00:46:27.141
at least in part for reasons
that arise out of the

00:46:27.141 --> 00:46:30.791
distinction between these two
positions that I've been making

00:46:30.791 --> 00:46:31.400
today.
 

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.969
We may or may not have the
lecture on Iser,

00:46:34.969 --> 00:46:38.797
but on Tuesday we'll be getting
into the varieties of formalism

00:46:38.797 --> 00:46:42.070
and first we'll take up the
American New Criticism.

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:42.659
All right.
 

00:46:42.659 --> 00:46:43.170
Thanks.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.365
Professor Donald
Kagan: Our topic today is

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:08.370
the Dark Ages and the world of
Homer,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.523
and of course,
you have as one of your reading

00:00:12.523 --> 00:00:18.061
assignments a problem that deals
precisely with that question

00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:23.321
that asks the subordinate
question: was there a real world

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:28.450
that Homer's poems refer to?
If so, what world was it?

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.310
Was it the world of the
Mycenaean Bronze Age?

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.055
Was it the world that succeeded
that Bronze Age that we call the

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:42.810
Dark Ages?
Was it the world in which

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.982
tradition says Homer himself
lived, the transition first to

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:54.090
the Archaic and then to the
Classical Period,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.535
the period in which we think
about the dawn of the

00:00:57.535 --> 00:01:01.097
polis?
That really is the question we

00:01:01.097 --> 00:01:05.276
are wrestling with and,
of course, behind it all is

00:01:05.276 --> 00:01:09.706
this idea: can we seek any
historical information from

00:01:09.706 --> 00:01:13.963
Homer's poems at all?
It would be a terrible blow to

00:01:13.963 --> 00:01:18.060
me and everybody else in the
field if the answer was "no,"

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.103
because just about everything
we have to say about this period

00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:26.906
between the Bronze Age and the
emergence of the

00:01:26.906 --> 00:01:31.205
polis--most of it
involves inferences from our

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:35.670
understanding of what the
Homeric poems tell us.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.236
But I think we need to take
a hard look at what we can do,

00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:44.278
and I thought it would be
worthwhile reading a sentence

00:01:44.278 --> 00:01:48.695
from each of the introductory
paragraphs that we provide for

00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:52.962
you in the problem packet to
show you the range of opinion

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:57.379
that is pretty representative of
what scholars think or have

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:01.247
thought on the subject.
Moses Finley says,

00:02:01.247 --> 00:02:05.515
"If, then, the world of
Odysseus is to be placed in time

00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:09.939
as everything we know from the
comparative study of heroic

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.677
poetry says it must,
the most likely centuries seem

00:02:14.677 --> 00:02:20.364
to be the tenth and the ninth,
that is to say what we call the

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:23.389
Dark Ages."
Anthony Andrews says,

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:27.976
"It may be that the epic
tradition had at some stage used

00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:31.169
as a model for the army before
Troy,

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:36.120
an idealized version of some of
those bands of colonists who

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.069
settled the coast of Asia Minor
in post-Mycenaean times."

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.388
And if you look at the whole
story that he tells,

00:02:44.388 --> 00:02:48.468
that really means quite soon
after the fall of the Mycenaean

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:51.690
world,
probably maybe a century

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.379
earlier than what Finley
suggests.

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.300
And then A.M.
Snodgrass says,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.411
"I offer this as a further
argument against the existence

00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:06.879
of a historical,
Homeric society."

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.870
There isn't anything to be
found is what Snodgrass says.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.311
Ian Morris writes,
"The balance of probability

00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:19.594
seems to be in favor of a
consistent basis to the society

00:03:19.594 --> 00:03:24.490
of the poems derived from Greece
in the eight century B.C.,"

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.377
which would be at the end of
the period we've been talking

00:03:28.377 --> 00:03:31.105
about, the transition to the
world of the

00:03:31.105 --> 00:03:35.129
polis--Homer's own time
when he lived and wrote.

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.695
And finally,
Barry Strauss says,

00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:40.922
"Ironically,
the more Homer exaggerates,

00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:45.639
the more authentic he is as a
representative of the Bronze

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.620
Age."
So, what do we do?

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.398
Well, all of these are learned
and clever men,

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:55.680
but I don't think that they're
all equally right.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.518
But what I should also report
to you is that I think there is

00:04:00.518 --> 00:04:04.872
a widespread consensus among
most people that study the

00:04:04.872 --> 00:04:07.020
subject.
That doesn't mean that

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.880
consensus is correct.
Not all of these opinions are

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.393
shared by the same number,
by no means,

00:04:14.393 --> 00:04:17.759
of scholars.
Some of them are far out.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.768
I would say the one that says
you can't learn anything from

00:04:21.768 --> 00:04:25.973
this is an outlier.
The notion that this is about

00:04:25.973 --> 00:04:31.102
the Mycenaean world is an
outlier, and then I would say

00:04:31.102 --> 00:04:35.565
the largest consensus is
something like Finley's

00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:39.752
consensus,
but people verging in both

00:04:39.752 --> 00:04:44.654
directions from that.
What you'll hear from me is

00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:48.129
essentially that consensus point
of view.

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:54.930
It strikes me as being better
supported than the others,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:01.606
but we really have to keep an
open mind because in this

00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:06.687
prehistoric period,
you have to be very modest

00:05:06.687 --> 00:05:10.129
about what you think you know
about it.

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.135
Almost everything is inference
and judgment,

00:05:13.135 --> 00:05:17.189
and very little is anything
that you want to call proof.

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.799
With those warnings,
let me tell you sort of what I

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:23.470
think most people think about
this.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.497
First of all,
if we want to know about the

00:05:26.497 --> 00:05:30.410
Dark Ages, what sources do we
have available to us?

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.981
And of course,
I've already mentioned the

00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:36.968
poems of Homer turn out to be a
very large source for what most

00:05:36.968 --> 00:05:40.396
people look to.
Secondly, there are legends

00:05:40.396 --> 00:05:44.156
that the Greeks told about their
early history,

00:05:44.156 --> 00:05:49.059
which come down to us in later
sources and they are available

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.831
to us to use as sources.
A great question is,

00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:56.476
should we use them at all,
and if we do how carefully

00:05:56.476 --> 00:06:00.154
should we use them and so on?
This is a good time for me

00:06:00.154 --> 00:06:02.403
to make a confession,
so that you'll know how to

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:04.460
judge what I say all through the
course.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.908
Well, prior to the late
eighteenth century when German

00:06:13.908 --> 00:06:18.750
scholars began to look at the
Homeric poems specifically,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.263
very, very carefully,
and then really very,

00:06:22.263 --> 00:06:25.525
very skeptically,
they made all sorts of

00:06:25.525 --> 00:06:30.042
suggestions that the poems we
have are really not to be

00:06:30.042 --> 00:06:33.889
thought of as the work of a
single poet,

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.209
Homer, who had--wrote them both
out together.

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:41.297
But who began to divide them up
into early and late elements,

00:06:41.297 --> 00:06:45.588
which I thought drove the field
of classics insane for about 100

00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:48.150
years,
while folks argued about the

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.105
unity of Homer,
the unity or not the unity of

00:06:51.105 --> 00:06:55.052
one of the poems and so on.
But it began a critical study

00:06:55.052 --> 00:06:58.784
of the poems for the first time
and critical methods were

00:06:58.784 --> 00:07:01.850
applied to history for the first
time ever,

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.019
really, in the early nineteenth
century and thereafter.

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:14.353
And it became common to reject
any ancient story that wasn't

00:07:14.353 --> 00:07:21.980
really nailed down very,
very firmly by some device.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.574
To take a skeptical
view--and a very interesting

00:07:25.574 --> 00:07:29.498
example of how things changed,
if you look at people,

00:07:29.498 --> 00:07:33.821
say an Englishman writing about
Ancient Greece in the late

00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:37.437
eighteenth century,
they tell the story of the

00:07:37.437 --> 00:07:41.483
early days based upon the
legends as though the legends

00:07:41.483 --> 00:07:44.779
were reliable information to
some degree.

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:48.334
When you get to say the middle
of the nineteenth century and

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:51.949
the work of the great English
historian of Ancient Greece,

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:55.696
George Grote,
he begins his story in 776 with

00:07:55.696 --> 00:07:59.243
the Olympic Games.
He does tell you all about the

00:07:59.243 --> 00:08:02.009
legends first,
but he puts them aside and says

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:04.959
they're just legends--now let's
talk history,

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:08.459
and he doesn't begin that until
the eight century B.C.

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:12.258
And so there is this critical
school that says,

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:16.800
"I won't believe anything
unless it is proven to me."

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:23.347
At the other extreme,
there's me, the most gullible

00:08:23.347 --> 00:08:27.870
historian imaginable.
My principle is this.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:35.978
I believe anything written in
ancient Latin or Greek unless I

00:08:35.978 --> 00:08:39.264
can't.
Now, things that prevent me

00:08:39.264 --> 00:08:43.672
from believing what I read are
that they are internally

00:08:43.672 --> 00:08:47.748
contradictory,
or what they say is impossible,

00:08:47.748 --> 00:08:52.779
or different ones contradict
each other and they can't both

00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:55.791
be right.
So, in those cases I abandon

00:08:55.791 --> 00:08:59.434
the ancient evidence.
Otherwise, you've got to

00:08:59.434 --> 00:09:02.490
convince me that they're not
true.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.663
Now, you might think of
this as, indeed,

00:09:04.663 --> 00:09:07.246
gullible.
A former colleague of mine put

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:09.070
the thing very,
very well.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.806
He spoke about,
and I like to claim this

00:09:12.806 --> 00:09:18.268
approach, the position of
scholarship to which we call the

00:09:18.268 --> 00:09:20.760
higher naiveté.

00:09:24.409 --> 00:09:25.714
The way this works is,
you start out,

00:09:25.714 --> 00:09:27.490
you don't know anything,
and you're naïve.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.738
You believe everything.
Next, you get a college

00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:35.802
education and you don't believe
anything, and then you reach the

00:09:35.802 --> 00:09:39.072
level of wisdom,
the higher naiveté,

00:09:39.072 --> 00:09:43.160
and you know what to believe
even though you can't prove it.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.887
Okay, be warned;
I'm a practitioner of the

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:52.539
higher naiveté.
So, I think the way to deal

00:09:52.539 --> 00:09:57.783
with legends is to regard them
as different from essentially

00:09:57.783 --> 00:10:01.250
sophisticated historical
statements,

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:06.679
but as possibly deriving from
facts, which have obviously been

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:11.100
distorted and misunderstood,
misused and so on.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.037
But it would be reckless,
it seems to me,

00:10:14.037 --> 00:10:18.370
to just put them aside and not
ask yourself the question,

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.740
"Can there be something
believable at the roof of this?"

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.283
And just to give you some
small defense of that approach,

00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:28.510
I always like to ask students,
"Suppose we didn't have a

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.352
single historical record,
no newspaper,

00:10:31.352 --> 00:10:34.077
no diaries.
You know nothing totally

00:10:34.077 --> 00:10:37.643
reliable for what happened in
the latter part of the

00:10:37.643 --> 00:10:42.103
eighteenth century in America."
Would we know anything about

00:10:42.103 --> 00:10:44.730
what happened?
Of course, we would.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.630
We would know that there was a
revolution;

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.902
it was against Great Britain.
I'm sure we would know that the

00:10:49.902 --> 00:10:53.804
French assisted in that.
I am certain we would know that

00:10:53.804 --> 00:10:58.480
George Washington was the
commander of our forces in our

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.830
battle.
Those are easy.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.869
There's no getting around
reading those things,

00:11:02.869 --> 00:11:05.440
and then it gets to be more
interesting as we speculate.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.311
We would know as a fact that
George Washington threw a silver

00:11:09.311 --> 00:11:12.732
dollar across the Rappahannock
River, except that it's

00:11:12.732 --> 00:11:15.100
impossible.
So, we would dismiss that one.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.749
We would be told that he was
very honest and told his father

00:11:18.749 --> 00:11:22.027
he chopped down a cherry tree,
which would be baloney,

00:11:22.027 --> 00:11:25.898
but we would be told that too.
But I think we would be told

00:11:25.898 --> 00:11:29.120
also very many true things,
which came down to us.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.881
So, the hard job would be to
select among these legendary

00:11:32.881 --> 00:11:37.112
things, to see what fact can be
found, and it will never be easy

00:11:37.112 --> 00:11:41.643
or deadly certain.
But that's what I'm talking

00:11:41.643 --> 00:11:43.812
about here.
Finally,

00:11:43.812 --> 00:11:47.944
there is the source that people
who are skeptical most like to

00:11:47.944 --> 00:11:52.663
believe because it's tangible.
I'm talking about archaeology,

00:11:52.663 --> 00:11:55.561
which is the discovery,
examination,

00:11:55.561 --> 00:11:58.789
and evaluation of material
evidence,

00:11:58.789 --> 00:12:02.601
which is not in writing,
the actual remains of places

00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:05.973
where they lived,
the implements that they used

00:12:05.973 --> 00:12:08.139
and so on,
and so on.

00:12:08.139 --> 00:12:11.180
And the beautiful thing about
that is you actually have it.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.750
It's objective.
It's an object.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.049
It's not something that
somebody imagined,

00:12:16.049 --> 00:12:19.357
but you shouldn't derive as
much confidence from it as a lot

00:12:19.357 --> 00:12:23.516
of archaeologists like to,
because it's only a thing until

00:12:23.516 --> 00:12:27.590
you say what it means,
until you put a date on it,

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.843
until you try to understand
what it really is,

00:12:30.843 --> 00:12:34.170
what its function was,
who brought it there,

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.710
who left it there.
All those things have to be

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:42.092
reasoned out from all the
evidence, all the information

00:12:42.092 --> 00:12:45.365
you can get.
So there's an astonishing

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:50.379
amount of speculation involved
in establishing this apparently

00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:55.078
rigorous objective technique.
We certainly need to use it and

00:12:55.078 --> 00:12:58.214
we need to use it as carefully,
that's my point,

00:12:58.214 --> 00:13:03.481
as we use everything else.
But it is indeed very valuable

00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:08.480
in studying a world before our
time, always.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.970
Now, we mentioned how
important the poems are.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.675
So, we need to take a look at
the question of what they are,

00:13:15.675 --> 00:13:17.509
and how we know about them,
and so on.

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:22.016
I mentioned to you that the
Iliad and the Odyssey

00:13:22.016 --> 00:13:26.522
were known in the Western world
continuously from the time that

00:13:26.522 --> 00:13:30.267
they were made available.
So they were known and they

00:13:30.267 --> 00:13:34.026
were very important in the minds
of those people who knew about

00:13:34.026 --> 00:13:37.328
it,
but I also mentioned last time

00:13:37.328 --> 00:13:42.323
the impact of Schliemann's
excavations, which turned

00:13:42.323 --> 00:13:46.432
everything around.
The hyper-skeptical point of

00:13:46.432 --> 00:13:50.905
view taken by scholars in Europe
in the nineteenth century was

00:13:50.905 --> 00:13:55.084
eroded very sharply by the
discovery of places that really

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:59.410
convinced pretty much everybody
that there was a Troy,

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.099
and that there was a Mycenae.
And so the stories couldn't

00:14:03.099 --> 00:14:07.488
have been simple inventions,
and that began a new phase in

00:14:07.488 --> 00:14:10.602
the story.
And, again, to repeat what I

00:14:10.602 --> 00:14:13.772
said last time,
there were certain stunning

00:14:13.772 --> 00:14:17.998
physical resemblances between
what Homer said and what we

00:14:17.998 --> 00:14:21.033
could see.
The palaces were like the

00:14:21.033 --> 00:14:26.000
palaces that he described.
The world that they lived in

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.509
was a world in which bronze was
used for implements,

00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:34.613
and weapons,
and such, not iron,

00:14:34.613 --> 00:14:39.620
and that squared with what was
found in Mycenae,

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:44.231
what was found in the Mycenaean
world, namely bronze implements

00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:48.942
and fundamentally not iron ones.
Sometimes there were

00:14:48.942 --> 00:14:54.670
interesting little problems that
emerged and one of those has to

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:58.490
do with the use of chariots in
warfare.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:05.560
Well, Homer has his heroes
using chariots and we know that

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:12.631
chariots were used in warfare in
the Bronze Age around the

00:15:12.631 --> 00:15:17.902
Mediterranean Sea.
We have hard evidence of that

00:15:17.902 --> 00:15:22.373
in Egypt, in Asia Minor,
and in the Tigris Euphrates

00:15:22.373 --> 00:15:24.582
Valley.
So, you would say,

00:15:24.582 --> 00:15:28.356
well, that's another place
where Homer got it right,

00:15:28.356 --> 00:15:32.649
except for the fact that we
also know how chariots are used

00:15:32.649 --> 00:15:35.610
in warfare and the closest
analogy,

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.639
I think, is to think of
chariots as tanks.

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:44.363
You know, one famous tactic
is--if you have an infantry

00:15:44.363 --> 00:15:48.080
force coming forward,
you send tanks in it to break

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.047
up the line of the infantry,
so that you can defeat the

00:15:52.047 --> 00:15:56.083
infantry in that way.
And apparently that is the way

00:15:56.083 --> 00:15:59.720
you use chariots in ancient
Bronze Age warfare.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.868
You would send the chariot
racing toward the line of

00:16:03.868 --> 00:16:08.098
infantrymen and the usual
outcome was the infantrymen

00:16:08.098 --> 00:16:13.059
would panic in the face of being
charged by these things,

00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:18.621
and you would break their line
and give the other side an

00:16:18.621 --> 00:16:23.090
opportunity to wreak havoc with
their army.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:27.270
Well, what do the Homeric
heroes do with their chariots?

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.370
They use them as taxicabs.

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:37.016
Achilles or Patroclus,
or whoever is on his chariot,

00:16:37.016 --> 00:16:40.485
is driving.
He is riding from the ships or

00:16:40.485 --> 00:16:43.860
wherever he is from the camp to
the battlefield.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:49.020
He might pick up a missile of
some kind, a spear typically,

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.580
and fire it at somebody as he
goes by.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:57.342
This would be a drive by
killing, but then when he really

00:16:57.342 --> 00:17:02.274
gets to where the action is he
hops off--now we're going to

00:17:02.274 --> 00:17:06.774
have some fighting.
And so, the implication I

00:17:06.774 --> 00:17:11.511
think is that the memory of
chariot warfare back in the

00:17:11.511 --> 00:17:16.232
Mycenaean days lingered;
it was captured in the poetry

00:17:16.232 --> 00:17:21.017
that goes back--the bits of the
poetry that goes back to the

00:17:21.017 --> 00:17:24.759
Mycenaean period.
But how they were used was

00:17:24.759 --> 00:17:29.243
forgotten, and so the poets in
the subsequent years then

00:17:29.243 --> 00:17:31.125
thought,
"How would I use a

00:17:31.125 --> 00:17:34.300
chariot?"--never having seen a
chariot fight in a battle,

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.119
and that's the outcome.
Finley, particularly,

00:17:39.119 --> 00:17:42.445
makes a lot of this as being
rather indicative of how he

00:17:42.445 --> 00:17:46.216
pictures the poems to work.
There are sort of legitimate

00:17:46.216 --> 00:17:50.478
memories, some of them going way
back to the Mycenaean period,

00:17:50.478 --> 00:17:54.740
but which may be misremembered
in some significant detail.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.963
And then, of course,
there's lots of stuff that

00:17:56.963 --> 00:17:59.670
doesn't have anything to do with
the Mycenaean period.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.555
His view is much,
if not most,

00:18:01.555 --> 00:18:04.740
of what we are told about the
Homeric world comes,

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.380
as he says, in the tenth and in
the ninth centuries.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:17.099
One other thing that he
doesn't mention but I think is

00:18:17.099 --> 00:18:20.336
worth mentioning.
Many a scholar are very

00:18:20.336 --> 00:18:25.269
reluctant to admit that there's
any Mycenaean stuff here,

00:18:25.269 --> 00:18:29.390
although they cannot fail to
concede that some of the

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:33.826
physical implements that are
found at Mycenaean sites are

00:18:33.826 --> 00:18:38.311
precisely like what Homer says.
But I think you can go a little

00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:40.958
bit beyond that.
Some scholars have pointed out

00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:44.204
that in Book II of the
Iliad in the section that we

00:18:44.204 --> 00:18:47.145
call,
"The Catalog of Ships," the

00:18:47.145 --> 00:18:52.759
poet lays out just exactly how
many warships came to Troy from

00:18:52.759 --> 00:18:56.177
Greece,
and just exactly how many came

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:59.793
from each town.
And the names of the towns that

00:18:59.793 --> 00:19:03.549
are listed in that catalog of
ships, first of all,

00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:08.186
are all legitimate in the sense
every one of them we know did

00:19:08.186 --> 00:19:13.377
exist in the Mycenaean Period.
And perhaps no less significant

00:19:13.377 --> 00:19:18.548
is that there are also towns
listed there that are Mycenaean

00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:23.369
towns, which disappeared after
the Mycenaean Period.

00:19:23.369 --> 00:19:25.442
In other words,
they couldn't just have named

00:19:25.442 --> 00:19:27.985
towns that used to be Mycenaean,
but were still around,

00:19:27.985 --> 00:19:31.376
so that's why they knew them.
No, some towns had disappeared,

00:19:31.376 --> 00:19:35.049
but the names of those towns
show up in the catalog of ships.

00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:39.906
There's just no way to explain
that except to say that catalog

00:19:39.906 --> 00:19:43.490
of ships goes back to the
Mycenaean Period.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.439
Now, the differences
between what we find in the

00:19:47.439 --> 00:19:50.769
Homeric poems are also very
illuminating,

00:19:50.769 --> 00:19:54.263
differences between that and
what we know happened after the

00:19:54.263 --> 00:19:56.772
fall of the Mycenaean world.
For instance,

00:19:56.772 --> 00:19:59.981
one of the most striking things
that you find in cultures,

00:19:59.981 --> 00:20:02.910
anthropologists and
archaeologists live off this,

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.230
is what they do with dead
bodies.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:12.347
Now, in Mycenae, it's obvious;
they bury them in the ground as

00:20:12.347 --> 00:20:15.357
most of us do.
The graves in the circle,

00:20:15.357 --> 00:20:18.436
the shaft graves,
and then the beehive tombs for

00:20:18.436 --> 00:20:21.347
the big shots,
and even outside in the

00:20:21.347 --> 00:20:25.724
countryside, we find graves
which have bones of people in

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:30.267
them.
But we know that the Greeks in

00:20:30.267 --> 00:20:36.232
Homer don't do that.
The Greeks in Homer incinerate

00:20:36.232 --> 00:20:42.630
the bodies of the dead.
You remember the Iliad

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:50.402
ends with the actual cremation
of the bodies of the relevant

00:20:50.402 --> 00:20:53.679
people.
So, that's a very significant

00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:57.616
difference.
That memory had simply died out

00:20:57.616 --> 00:21:03.969
and it helps us to remember too
that the tombs that we have seen

00:21:03.969 --> 00:21:08.948
now, they didn't see.
Whoever was writing the poems

00:21:08.948 --> 00:21:14.152
of Homer, whichever poets were
contributing to that over the

00:21:14.152 --> 00:21:18.926
ages after the Mycenaean Period,
they hadn't seen those

00:21:18.926 --> 00:21:23.269
Mycenaean sites.
They were buried.

00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:27.934
There are also differences,
sometimes, in the shape of

00:21:27.934 --> 00:21:32.681
weapons that we find in the
Greek World after the Mycenaean

00:21:32.681 --> 00:21:37.510
Period compared to what are
described in Homer's poems.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.879
I'm sorry.
Homer describes certain of

00:21:40.879 --> 00:21:44.998
these weapons,
which don't fit what we find in

00:21:44.998 --> 00:21:48.522
the ground.
And here's another critical

00:21:48.522 --> 00:21:50.350
element in the story.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.737
We know that the Mycenaeans,
or at least some small number

00:21:57.737 --> 00:22:01.154
of them could write,
because we have the Linear B

00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:06.100
script, which we can read.
There is no clue that there is

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.410
such a thing as writing in the
Homeric poems.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.449
There's one very abstruse clue
where somebody seems to know

00:22:13.449 --> 00:22:16.479
something about it,
but fundamentally it's an

00:22:16.479 --> 00:22:21.109
illiterate society and that is a
major difference between the

00:22:21.109 --> 00:22:24.349
world of Homer and the Mycenaean
world.

00:22:24.349 --> 00:22:28.321
Some other differences:
Homer's kings,

00:22:28.321 --> 00:22:33.259
if you just see how they live,
what they do,

00:22:33.259 --> 00:22:37.281
what their wives do,
how they are treated by their

00:22:37.281 --> 00:22:39.579
fellow noblemen,
they are,

00:22:39.579 --> 00:22:44.996
in a relative sense,
very weak, very short on power

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:51.279
and really quite poor compared
to these Mycenaean kings,

00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:56.455
the results of whose work and
lives we see at places like

00:22:56.455 --> 00:22:58.218
Mycenae.
Remember,

00:22:58.218 --> 00:23:01.570
I tried to emphasize how rich
you would have to be to

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.150
undertake the building of the
temple,

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:09.049
to undertake the construction
of one of those beehive tombs.

00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:12.447
You had to be very confident
because it was going to take a

00:23:12.447 --> 00:23:16.019
long time, a fantastic amount of
labor, a tremendous amount of

00:23:16.019 --> 00:23:19.700
money to do that.
There is no evidence in Homer

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:24.769
that anybody had that kind of
wealth or that kind of power.

00:23:24.769 --> 00:23:30.279
What do the queens in Homer do
in their spare time?

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:34.338
Or maybe it's not their spare
time, maybe it's their regular

00:23:34.338 --> 00:23:37.224
time.
Well, one of the things that

00:23:37.224 --> 00:23:42.549
they do when the Homeric heroes
refer to their wives--there are

00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:47.960
really only two places that they
seem to be associated with.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:53.759
One is the bedroom and the
other is the loom.

00:23:53.759 --> 00:23:58.530
What these ladies are doing is
weaving cloth.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:03.585
Now, that's not what queens do.
I'm sure the Mycenaean queens

00:24:03.585 --> 00:24:05.851
didn't do that,
but it's very,

00:24:05.851 --> 00:24:10.539
very interesting that that is
what the Homeric queens do.

00:24:10.539 --> 00:24:16.258
Well, how are we to explain the
discrepancies that are so great

00:24:16.258 --> 00:24:21.124
between these worlds?
And the answer that almost

00:24:21.124 --> 00:24:27.140
everybody now accepts without
argument is that these poems

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:31.890
were created orally,
and passed on orally.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:37.452
That they were not written
down, so that what we have in

00:24:37.452 --> 00:24:43.116
the poems of Homer reflects
centuries of bards passing on

00:24:43.116 --> 00:24:46.811
bits of the poem,
or the poem in various

00:24:46.811 --> 00:24:50.498
versions, being always creative.
I mean, any bard,

00:24:50.498 --> 00:24:54.640
if by analogy we know about
bards in the modern world,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.723
we have some evidence on that.
Millman Parry,

00:24:58.723 --> 00:25:03.737
a Harvard scholar back in the
twenties, went to Yugoslavia to

00:25:03.737 --> 00:25:07.329
live in the mountains and the
backwoods,

00:25:07.329 --> 00:25:12.504
and he lived with people who
still had these bards around who

00:25:12.504 --> 00:25:17.420
created sort of epic narratives
of considerable length,

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.890
but nothing resembling Homeric
length, I must say.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.424
Nothing that long,
but long enough in which they

00:25:24.424 --> 00:25:28.109
would tell the same stories in
verse and music,

00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:33.035
and you could recognize the
story as you went from bard to

00:25:33.035 --> 00:25:36.079
bard.
But every bard added and

00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:40.450
subtracted things to suit his
own talents.

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:45.574
That's the idea of the game,
and then Parry demonstrated by

00:25:45.574 --> 00:25:49.108
careful scholarship of the
Homeric poems,

00:25:49.108 --> 00:25:53.349
that that is the way the
Homeric poems were.

00:25:53.349 --> 00:25:56.993
I want to use the word stitched
together, because in the Ancient

00:25:56.993 --> 00:26:01.908
Greek world the people who sang,
recited, created the poems of

00:26:01.908 --> 00:26:06.789
the Homeric epics were called
rhapsodes,

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:12.549
and that means stitchers of
songs.

00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:16.793
So, what you have to imagine is
sometime back,

00:26:16.793 --> 00:26:20.660
I would argue,
in the Mycenaean Period,

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:25.919
somebody began making up one of
these songs, telling the story

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:29.799
of Greeks going to attack the
city of Troy.

00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:33.366
And that for centuries
thereafter, different

00:26:33.366 --> 00:26:37.430
rhapsodes repeated it but
elucidated it,

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.023
illuminated it,
extended it,

00:26:40.023 --> 00:26:45.980
changed it, tried to improve
it, sometimes they added stuff.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.549
They were alive in the tenth
century.

00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:50.638
Some of them were alive in the
ninth and certainly some of them

00:26:50.638 --> 00:26:53.029
were alive in the time of Homer
in the eighth.

00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:58.457
So that what we have before us,
is that kind of product and

00:26:58.457 --> 00:27:02.762
that will explain both the
similarities and the

00:27:02.762 --> 00:27:06.591
differences,
and that is what underlies our

00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:11.099
interpretation of how the poems
got to be what they were.

00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:16.855
So, what is this world like
that emerges from the world of

00:27:16.855 --> 00:27:19.473
Homer?
We don't have to make up our

00:27:19.473 --> 00:27:23.398
minds in advance whether it was
a real world or a completely

00:27:23.398 --> 00:27:26.510
fantastic one,
but at least let's see if we

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.269
can describe what world it looks
like.

00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:34.943
And I'm going to focus my
attention on what you might call

00:27:34.943 --> 00:27:40.616
the political side of that
society as it reveals itself in

00:27:40.616 --> 00:27:45.357
the poems.
We hear about key individuals,

00:27:45.357 --> 00:27:50.490
and the last time I mentioned
to you two words,

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:55.066
I think I did,
but I'll mention them again

00:27:55.066 --> 00:27:59.226
this time.
The head of the expedition to

00:27:59.226 --> 00:28:01.541
Troy, Agamemnon,
the sort of

00:28:01.541 --> 00:28:05.656
generalissimo of that
expedition is called

00:28:05.656 --> 00:28:10.406
wanax.
When you drop the "w" as later

00:28:10.406 --> 00:28:15.109
Greek dialects did,
it becomes anax.

00:28:15.109 --> 00:28:19.935
He, so far as I know,
and I think I'm not forgetting,

00:28:19.935 --> 00:28:25.317
he is the only human being
referred to in the poems in that

00:28:25.317 --> 00:28:27.849
way.
There are, however,

00:28:27.849 --> 00:28:32.840
many an individual in the poem
who is referred to as a

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.575
basileus,
the plural is basileis,

00:28:37.575 --> 00:28:42.680
which is normally and regularly
translated as king,

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.715
and that's right.
For instance,

00:28:44.715 --> 00:28:48.661
in historical times when the
Greeks referred to the great

00:28:48.661 --> 00:28:51.664
King of Persia,
who was a real king and a

00:28:51.664 --> 00:28:54.300
powerful figure,
a king in every sense,

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.769
the word they used for him was
basileus.

00:28:57.769 --> 00:29:02.234
But we quickly see that the
people referred to as

00:29:02.234 --> 00:29:08.280
basileus in Homer are not
like the great King of Persia.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:16.670
They are much lesser figures.
I'll come back to that in just

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.021
a moment.
The Mycenaean kings we

00:29:19.021 --> 00:29:22.880
know, thanks to the Linear B
tablets, were referred to,

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.249
the singular once again is
wanax,

00:29:26.249 --> 00:29:29.359
and the plural is
wanaktes.

00:29:29.359 --> 00:29:34.230
But in Homer the term is
reserved for Agamemnon or for

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:38.089
gods, but not for any other
human being.

00:29:38.089 --> 00:29:43.950
And that raises the question,
why is Agamemnon wanax?

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.768
And that, I think,
we have to understand as being

00:29:47.768 --> 00:29:51.190
because of his function in the
situation,

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:56.781
namely there is a multi-city
invasion of Troy being carried

00:29:56.781 --> 00:30:02.077
on by these Mycenaean Greeks.
Agamemnon has been chosen as

00:30:02.077 --> 00:30:06.279
the generalissimo and
that is what gives him,

00:30:06.279 --> 00:30:09.740
temporarily,
the title of wanax.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.994
I would imagine and I'm very
confident that after the war of

00:30:13.994 --> 00:30:18.176
Troy, if Agamemnon had been
allowed by his wife to live for

00:30:18.176 --> 00:30:22.069
more than a few minutes after he
set foot at home,

00:30:22.069 --> 00:30:25.128
he would no longer be called
wanax,

00:30:25.128 --> 00:30:28.783
but would be called
basileus like the other

00:30:28.783 --> 00:30:33.424
rulers of their local towns.
You remember I suggested that

00:30:33.424 --> 00:30:37.622
in the Linear B tablets when
there was a reference to a

00:30:37.622 --> 00:30:41.229
basileus,
he's clearly well below the

00:30:41.229 --> 00:30:46.039
wanax and some scholars
suggest, in a persuasive way,

00:30:46.039 --> 00:30:49.611
I think, that these
basileus may have been

00:30:49.611 --> 00:30:53.480
village chieftains but that's as
high as they got.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:58.096
But it's very interesting that
when you get to historical

00:30:58.096 --> 00:31:02.185
Greece, as we shall see,
there are no wanaktes

00:31:02.185 --> 00:31:04.616
but there are,
at least according to

00:31:04.616 --> 00:31:07.720
tradition,
basileis.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:13.831
But no basileus has
anything like the clout that the

00:31:13.831 --> 00:31:17.782
Mycenaean kings did,
and of course we don't hear of

00:31:17.782 --> 00:31:20.884
any of them who have even the
temporary special power that

00:31:20.884 --> 00:31:24.301
Agamemnon has.
No human being is referred to

00:31:24.301 --> 00:31:28.769
as wanax in the period of
historical Greece.

00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:32.861
And of course,
the kings when we see them in

00:31:32.861 --> 00:31:37.650
Homer do not have a bureaucracy,
do not have scribes.

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.700
How could there be scribes?
They didn't know how to write.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.875
There are no inventories.
These are not rich guys with

00:31:44.875 --> 00:31:49.874
fantastic quantities of stuff
that has to be cataloged and

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:53.592
inventoried.
The kings, by our standards for

00:31:53.592 --> 00:31:58.169
kings, are really very poor.
What do they do in their spare

00:31:58.169 --> 00:32:00.809
time or in their time in
general?

00:32:00.809 --> 00:32:03.400
They, themselves,
engage in agriculture.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.800
I don't mean they dig in the
ground, but they supervise it;

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.021
they think about it.
They are like people who are in

00:32:11.021 --> 00:32:14.613
charge of a plantation,
their own plantation,

00:32:14.613 --> 00:32:16.698
I mean.
So, that's one of their

00:32:16.698 --> 00:32:19.315
activities.
You cannot imagine the great

00:32:19.315 --> 00:32:23.296
kings of Mycenae doing that.
They would've had all kinds of

00:32:23.296 --> 00:32:26.099
subordinate officials taking
care of that.

00:32:26.099 --> 00:32:28.901
Another thing that these kings
are seen to do,

00:32:28.901 --> 00:32:32.700
which is in a way even at a
lower level, is to be herdsmen.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:36.700
Again, not themselves out there
with the goats and the sheep,

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:40.633
but they are referred to as
having these herds and having to

00:32:40.633 --> 00:32:44.193
cope with them.
Another very popular,

00:32:44.193 --> 00:32:49.055
I would say the most popular
activity among the kings,

00:32:49.055 --> 00:32:53.200
was piracy.
That's what they brag about.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.550
Achilles, my God,
what a king he is!

00:32:55.550 --> 00:33:00.369
He sacked 24 cities.
Why do you sack a city?

00:33:00.369 --> 00:33:05.130
To steal what they have and,
well, there are all kinds of

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:10.059
wonderful examples of people in
the Iliad and the

00:33:10.059 --> 00:33:13.205
Odyssey.
Some stranger comes,

00:33:13.205 --> 00:33:17.400
this is in the Odyssey,
and they ask him,

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.779
"Sir, are you a pirate?"
And he says,

00:33:20.779 --> 00:33:24.658
"No, no, I'm not a pirate,"
just like they asked,

00:33:24.658 --> 00:33:27.730
I mean, "Do you come from
Chicago?"

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.740
He wasn't insulted.
"No, I'm not a pirate,

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.240
but I could've been,
of course.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:32.660
We understand that."

00:33:36.059 --> 00:33:39.893
And then later on in the story
that Homer tells in the

00:33:39.893 --> 00:33:42.859
Odyssey,
Odysseus himself is such a

00:33:42.859 --> 00:33:46.067
newcomer.
He's taken to the beautiful

00:33:46.067 --> 00:33:51.022
city on the island of Scheria,
Phaiacia, and is treated with

00:33:51.022 --> 00:33:56.230
great respect as you're supposed
to in the Mycenaean world.

00:33:56.230 --> 00:34:00.385
But after dinner,
they do what they do to amuse

00:34:00.385 --> 00:34:03.610
themselves.
They have athletic contests and

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:05.859
they ask Odysseus to
participate.

00:34:05.859 --> 00:34:09.493
And he says,
"No, no, I'm too miserable and

00:34:09.493 --> 00:34:14.598
wretched," and the guy says,
"Oh, you must be some kind of a

00:34:14.598 --> 00:34:21.396
merchant."
And Odysseus says that that was

00:34:21.396 --> 00:34:26.360
a black remark.
Those are fighting words.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.541
You can't call--we know
Odysseus himself is a

00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:33.970
basileus--him a merchant.
Pirate, sure, but merchant, no.

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:41.842
Another thing that is
interesting is that when you

00:34:41.842 --> 00:34:46.079
look at the burials of Greeks in
the post-Mycenaean period,

00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:49.778
in the Dark Ages,
there's nothing resembling

00:34:49.778 --> 00:34:55.025
those grand tombs and the wealth
that's buried in them for the

00:34:55.025 --> 00:34:58.023
dead.
You find that the tombs of

00:34:58.023 --> 00:35:02.300
noblemen are very much the same
one as the other.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:08.143
You're struck by the equality
from the standpoint of riches of

00:35:08.143 --> 00:35:12.450
the dead nobility.
No great distinction and no

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:16.521
great riches either.
You're dealing with a poorer

00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:21.182
world and a world that doesn't
have this kind of outstanding

00:35:21.182 --> 00:35:25.126
monarchy.
So, one of the things I think

00:35:25.126 --> 00:35:30.190
we learn is that the Homeric
world of the kings,

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.864
the role of the kings,
the wealth of the kings,

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:35.887
the power of the kings,
the place of the kings is not

00:35:35.887 --> 00:35:40.199
taken from the Mycenaean period.
If it's describing anything

00:35:40.199 --> 00:35:44.886
that's real, it's describing
very clearly a post-Mycenaean

00:35:44.886 --> 00:35:49.820
world in those Dark Ages that we
have been talking about.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:54.165
But another thing that
crops up is that in the

00:35:54.165 --> 00:35:57.090
Iliad and the
Odyssey,

00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:02.558
you get a very clear picture,
really of what is the political

00:36:02.558 --> 00:36:05.956
structure of each society.
And by the way,

00:36:05.956 --> 00:36:09.114
you must keep in mind a very
important difference between

00:36:09.114 --> 00:36:11.539
the Iliad and the
Odyssey;

00:36:11.539 --> 00:36:14.050
the Iliad takes place at
Troy.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:17.293
None of these noblemen,
none of these kings,

00:36:17.293 --> 00:36:21.969
none of these heroes is back
home in his own town ruling it.

00:36:21.969 --> 00:36:25.200
He is at war and he is serving
under a commander,

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.037
and so the behavior of these
people towards one another is

00:36:29.037 --> 00:36:31.730
not precisely like what it would
be.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.892
And here you see in the
Odyssey is what it would

00:36:34.892 --> 00:36:38.289
likely be, and the place where
you see it is back in Ithaca

00:36:38.289 --> 00:36:41.862
when Odysseus is there or when
we're taken to see what's going

00:36:41.862 --> 00:36:44.485
on.
I think that's a very important

00:36:44.485 --> 00:36:47.797
distinction to make,
but even when they're at Troy

00:36:47.797 --> 00:36:50.840
and in this sort of non-typical
situation,

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:54.095
we still see the same
institutions working,

00:36:54.095 --> 00:36:58.592
the same relationships being
present as would be present at

00:36:58.592 --> 00:37:01.012
home,
although you have to watch out

00:37:01.012 --> 00:37:03.930
for the difference.
What do I mean?

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:09.315
How are decisions made?
Does the king simply say,

00:37:09.315 --> 00:37:13.619
"Do it," and it gets done?
Nothing like that.

00:37:13.619 --> 00:37:17.840
The king has got important
powers.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.027
Agamemnon as the chief out
there in the Iliad,

00:37:21.027 --> 00:37:23.480
he can call a meeting of the
assembly,

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.133
I should say of the council,
but he's not the only one who

00:37:30.133 --> 00:37:32.498
can.
Any nobleman who wants to can

00:37:32.498 --> 00:37:36.325
say, "We ought to have a
council," and then that council

00:37:36.325 --> 00:37:40.153
will come together and do
whatever business they wish to

00:37:40.153 --> 00:37:42.254
do.
The council,

00:37:42.254 --> 00:37:46.115
however, is limited to
noblemen, to these

00:37:46.115 --> 00:37:49.885
basileis.
Ordinary soldiers do not

00:37:49.885 --> 00:37:54.480
attend, and that's one of the
things I think we must grasp

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.550
immediately.
The key line in the society of

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:06.885
the Dark Ages appears to be
certainly not between monarchy

00:38:06.885 --> 00:38:12.419
and everybody else,
but between nobility and

00:38:12.419 --> 00:38:17.202
commoners.
That's the really important,

00:38:17.202 --> 00:38:22.805
serious line--certainly
politically and in other ways as

00:38:22.805 --> 00:38:25.445
well.
There is, however,

00:38:25.445 --> 00:38:30.110
in Homer, an assembly that
consists of the men,

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:36.600
in the case of Troy of course
the fighting men who are there,

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.646
but who are not basileus.
But also in the home,

00:38:41.646 --> 00:38:46.280
at home, the men of fighting
age and condition.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.409
They are the only ones who
matter.

00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:51.979
Of course, as in all of the
rest of Greek history,

00:38:51.979 --> 00:38:55.111
women are excluded from the
political realm,

00:38:55.111 --> 00:38:58.098
and of course,
well, I'll just leave it at

00:38:58.098 --> 00:39:00.413
that.
But so, too,

00:39:00.413 --> 00:39:06.523
there's obviously an age limit.
You have to be of an age to be

00:39:06.523 --> 00:39:09.325
a fighting man.
It's not necessarily defined

00:39:09.325 --> 00:39:11.973
for us.
It depends, could have been 18,

00:39:11.973 --> 00:39:15.356
could have been 20.
In Athens, in classical times

00:39:15.356 --> 00:39:16.110
it was 20.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:24.521
Well, let me just remind
you of some events that show you

00:39:24.521 --> 00:39:28.312
how these things work.
Remember, the Iliad

00:39:28.312 --> 00:39:32.583
starts because of a quarrel and
the quarrel emerges from the

00:39:32.583 --> 00:39:36.710
fact that the Greeks are busily
being killed by a terrible

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:40.193
plague that has struck them.
They say, "We got to find out

00:39:40.193 --> 00:39:42.621
what's happening?"
They always assume that if

00:39:42.621 --> 00:39:46.569
something like that happened,
it was some god or gods who was

00:39:46.569 --> 00:39:50.435
angry with them.
So, they get a seer who goes

00:39:50.435 --> 00:39:55.480
and is persuaded to try to find
out what's happening.

00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:02.071
And he finally does ascertain
that Apollo is angry with the

00:40:02.071 --> 00:40:08.550
Greeks because Agamemnon took a
maiden from her father,

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:13.030
and that father was a priest of
Apollo.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:17.608
And so when this is
ascertained, Achilles,

00:40:17.608 --> 00:40:21.071
the biggest,
bravest, strongest,

00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:26.381
fastest hero on the Greek side,
intervenes and says,

00:40:26.381 --> 00:40:29.114
"Well, look,
why don't you give back the

00:40:29.114 --> 00:40:33.318
girl and then Apollo will stop
killing us and everything will

00:40:33.318 --> 00:40:36.375
be okay?"
Agamemnon gets furious with

00:40:36.375 --> 00:40:40.065
Achilles and he says,
"No, I'm not giving back my

00:40:40.065 --> 00:40:43.934
girl.
I'm the boss here," as Edward

00:40:43.934 --> 00:40:46.739
G.
Robinson used to say.

00:40:46.739 --> 00:40:48.562
How many of you ever heard of
Edward G.

00:40:48.562 --> 00:40:50.800
Robinson?
Just raise your hand, please.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.420
Good, put me in my place.
It gets worse every year for me.

00:40:57.289 --> 00:41:02.630
And Achilles then speaks up
and really lets him have it,

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:06.432
chews him out,
tells him what a bozo he is,

00:41:06.432 --> 00:41:10.144
and, you know,
the very important thing is

00:41:10.144 --> 00:41:12.521
this.
How can you do that if this is

00:41:12.521 --> 00:41:14.341
a king?
And the answer is:

00:41:14.341 --> 00:41:17.809
you can do that because you're
both kings.

00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:24.017
There is nothing out of line in
the sense of violating some kind

00:41:24.017 --> 00:41:28.893
of a real rule of the society,
but it's not typical,

00:41:28.893 --> 00:41:33.980
and especially since Agamemnon
has this position as the boss,

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.537
the most kingly of the kings.
That's a word that Homer uses

00:41:37.537 --> 00:41:40.887
of him, basileutatos,
the most kingly,

00:41:40.887 --> 00:41:43.780
and that's because of his
position.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.306
So, Achilles is not doing
anything sort of illegal or

00:41:47.306 --> 00:41:50.561
unconstitutional,
but he's doing something that's

00:41:50.561 --> 00:41:54.019
really out of line from a normal
point of view.

00:41:54.019 --> 00:41:55.879
And finally Agamemnon says,
"No, I'm not going to give back

00:41:55.879 --> 00:41:56.970
my girl, but I'll tell you what,

00:42:00.519 --> 00:42:07.008
I will give back my girl if I
am given the girl you took from

00:42:07.008 --> 00:42:10.300
a different Trojan,
and that'll be fine.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.829
I'll have your girl and you
won't have any."

00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:18.435
So now, Achilles really blows
his top and from the quarrel,

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:22.269
and finally when he says,
"Okay, if that's what you're

00:42:22.269 --> 00:42:24.984
going to do to me,
I'm taking my armor and I'm

00:42:24.984 --> 00:42:27.264
going home."
And off he goes,

00:42:27.264 --> 00:42:31.386
and he sulks in his tent for
the next nine books,

00:42:31.386 --> 00:42:36.110
and this turns out to be a
serious problem for them.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:40.544
But, what you learn from
that is that the way decisions

00:42:40.544 --> 00:42:43.679
are made, important decisions
are made,

00:42:43.679 --> 00:42:47.725
even in this army,
is by discussion among the

00:42:47.725 --> 00:42:51.219
basileis,
among the noblemen,

00:42:51.219 --> 00:42:55.459
and you will try to reach a
consensus about these things,

00:42:55.459 --> 00:42:58.789
and in an extreme odd situation
like this,

00:42:58.789 --> 00:43:01.124
it would have to be that they
would have to do what the

00:43:01.124 --> 00:43:04.105
commander says.
And probably back home there

00:43:04.105 --> 00:43:09.158
would be the implication that if
you can't work things out among

00:43:09.158 --> 00:43:12.847
them with consensus,
probably the king has some

00:43:12.847 --> 00:43:15.690
weight.
But what we have to remember is

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:19.331
he can't give orders to anybody
typically, although Agamemnon

00:43:19.331 --> 00:43:21.940
can get away with it on this
expedition.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.772
Well, that's one story.
Another story that we're

00:43:24.772 --> 00:43:28.018
told is that soon afterwards
also in that same place in

00:43:28.018 --> 00:43:30.614
the Iliad,
a dream comes to Agamemnon,

00:43:30.614 --> 00:43:32.940
because, you know,
this is their tenth year.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.289
They've been trying to take
this city for nine years.

00:43:35.289 --> 00:43:41.184
It's almost as bad as Iraq and
the soldiers are tired of all of

00:43:41.184 --> 00:43:43.811
this.
If we can't take the city,

00:43:43.811 --> 00:43:48.261
we ought to go home and there's
a lot of spirit that says we

00:43:48.261 --> 00:43:53.213
ought to go home.
And so a dream comes to

00:43:53.213 --> 00:43:56.019
Agamemnon.
The god says to him,

00:43:56.019 --> 00:44:00.474
"Here's what you need to do.
You need to try the spirit of

00:44:00.474 --> 00:44:06.117
your men, and in that way to
inspirit them to carry on until

00:44:06.117 --> 00:44:09.389
victory.
So, what you should do is to

00:44:09.389 --> 00:44:13.590
get up and speak to your
soldiers, and say that you're

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:17.529
never going to take Troy.
You might as well pack up and

00:44:17.529 --> 00:44:20.137
go home, and then they'll say,
'No, king, no,

00:44:20.137 --> 00:44:23.179
we receive to do that.
We insist on staying.

00:44:23.179 --> 00:44:25.834
We're going to re-up and do
another term,

00:44:25.834 --> 00:44:28.289
and we're going to take the
city.'"

00:44:28.289 --> 00:44:30.942
So, Agamemnon says,
"Great, I'll do that," and he

00:44:30.942 --> 00:44:34.202
calls the troops together to
battle, and he makes his little

00:44:34.202 --> 00:44:36.434
speech.
I wish I could reproduce the

00:44:36.434 --> 00:44:39.482
Homer.
I didn't take it along with me,

00:44:39.482 --> 00:44:44.425
but the essence of it is a
great roar and rumble emerged as

00:44:44.425 --> 00:44:49.368
the troops turned and began
racing back to the ships to get

00:44:49.368 --> 00:44:53.390
the hell out of there.
Just to carry on some of

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:56.094
the highlights,
that tells us a lot about the

00:44:56.094 --> 00:44:59.002
society.
So, as they're roaring back,

00:44:59.002 --> 00:45:02.510
suddenly Odysseus,
the slyest, the cleverest,

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:05.460
the smartest of all of the
Greeks,

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:09.199
he goes racing among the troops
who are heading back and he

00:45:09.199 --> 00:45:12.809
grabs one, and Homer says when
he came to a gentleman,

00:45:12.809 --> 00:45:14.452
a basileus,
he would say,

00:45:14.452 --> 00:45:17.685
"Sir, you are making a mistake.
You don't understand the game

00:45:17.685 --> 00:45:20.400
that Agamemnon is playing," and
he explains it to him,

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.039
and the guy says,
"Oh, okay."

00:45:22.039 --> 00:45:24.881
When he comes to one of the
common sort, he says,

00:45:24.881 --> 00:45:27.899
"You bloody imbecile,
get the hell back to where you

00:45:27.899 --> 00:45:31.262
belong."
That's a rough translation and

00:45:31.262 --> 00:45:36.301
everybody finally grabs enough
of them and the thing turns

00:45:36.301 --> 00:45:40.280
around, everybody goes back and
sits down.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:45.630
And up steps one man.

00:45:48.809 --> 00:45:53.500
Homer describes him as the
ugliest man in the entire army.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.056
So you get a clue as to what
we're supposed to think about

00:45:57.056 --> 00:46:00.301
him, and he makes a speech which
denounces all of the

00:46:00.301 --> 00:46:05.260
basileus,
Agamemnon ahead of any of them.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.724
He says, "We ordinary soldiers
have had enough and we would

00:46:08.724 --> 00:46:12.631
like to go home."
And up steps Odysseus and

00:46:12.631 --> 00:46:19.059
blasts him with his scepter,
smashes him across the back,

00:46:19.059 --> 00:46:23.264
leaving a welt that could be
seen by the entire army,

00:46:23.264 --> 00:46:26.579
and tears came to the eyes of
this guy.

00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:29.079
Are we supposed to feel
sorry for him?

00:46:29.079 --> 00:46:32.929
Well, the next lines in Homer
say that one soldier popped up

00:46:32.929 --> 00:46:36.712
and said, "Of all the great
things Odysseus has done for us

00:46:36.712 --> 00:46:39.962
here,
that was the greatest,

00:46:39.962 --> 00:46:45.530
to shut up a big mouth idiot
like Thersites."

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:49.743
Well, what Thersites had done
that was wrong,

00:46:49.743 --> 00:46:54.819
of course the poet and Odysseus
didn't like his policy

00:46:54.819 --> 00:46:59.800
suggestion, but he had no right
to speak at all.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:04.549
The only people who could speak
in the council or in an assembly

00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:07.639
were the noblemen,
the basileis.

00:47:07.639 --> 00:47:12.409
So, he had crossed the line as
an ordinary soldier.

00:47:12.409 --> 00:47:16.535
To rise and to say anything was
a violation of the culture,

00:47:16.535 --> 00:47:20.661
and that's one of the places
where you see where this sharp

00:47:20.661 --> 00:47:23.848
line exists.
They just take orders,

00:47:23.848 --> 00:47:27.760
but the gentlemen don't just
take orders.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:31.849
They can argue and sometimes
they can win the argument.

00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:35.822
So, what you see in this very
brief and inadequate account

00:47:35.822 --> 00:47:38.610
that I've given you is that we
really,

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:42.413
in spite of the fact that we
have basileis,

00:47:42.413 --> 00:47:45.440
and even in this case an
anax,

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:49.500
we really don't have a proper
monarchical tradition.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:53.003
When we think of monarchs,
single rulers,

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:57.541
we think of Hammurabi and we
think of the kings of Persia,

00:47:57.541 --> 00:48:02.309
and we think of Louis XIV.
We do not think of what we have

00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:06.379
here, which is a bunch of
noblemen who are essentially

00:48:06.379 --> 00:48:08.785
equal,
and the differences between

00:48:08.785 --> 00:48:12.090
them don't come from birth or
rank as between them,

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:16.610
but from wealth and power that
they happen to possess.

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:20.267
It is, rather,
not a royal society but an

00:48:20.267 --> 00:48:25.372
aristocratic society.
I think that's the main message

00:48:25.372 --> 00:48:30.505
and it is the matrix of all
future political ideas and

00:48:30.505 --> 00:48:36.219
arguments in the Greek world
that comes after this time.

00:48:36.219 --> 00:48:41.533
I think you need to understand
that what the Greeks in the

00:48:41.533 --> 00:48:47.219
historical period--once we start
having written records by the

00:48:47.219 --> 00:48:51.579
Greeks themselves,
the thing that is the standard

00:48:51.579 --> 00:48:56.351
position--what is this thing on
the computer when you fall back

00:48:56.351 --> 00:48:58.290
to a position?
What do you call that position?

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:09.679
What is it?
Default, that's right.

00:49:09.679 --> 00:49:15.508
Good, the default position in
Greek political theory is

00:49:15.508 --> 00:49:19.580
aristocracy;
that is the normal thing.

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:28.960
A very good example of that is
what I've been telling you;

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.098
that's really what happens.
And here's another thing,

00:49:32.098 --> 00:49:35.299
if you go to the end of the
Greek story, when you think

00:49:35.299 --> 00:49:37.886
about political theory,
there's Plato,

00:49:37.886 --> 00:49:41.625
and when he lays out the ideal
society in his view,

00:49:41.625 --> 00:49:48.158
in the Republic,
we find there are multiple

00:49:48.158 --> 00:49:51.290
rulers.
And these, of course,

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:56.290
turn out to be the winners of
the Jeopardy contest playoffs.

00:49:56.290 --> 00:50:00.000
But it doesn't matter.
There's never one king.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.338
It's always a group of people
that is the best government,

00:50:04.338 --> 00:50:08.882
and they will be the best.
In this case defined chiefly by

00:50:08.882 --> 00:50:12.150
their intelligence,
but other things too.

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:17.499
Well, anyway in this case,
in Greek political thinking the

00:50:17.499 --> 00:50:21.909
aristocracy of birth is the
default position.

00:50:21.909 --> 00:50:25.825
Anybody who wants to argue for
a different kind of political

00:50:25.825 --> 00:50:29.541
arrangement will have to make
the case uphill against all

00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:31.875
tradition.
I hope that you'll have that in

00:50:31.875 --> 00:50:34.550
the back of your head when we
get to the story of Athens and

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:37.950
the invention of democracy,
because it was off the wall

00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:41.050
from the perspective of Greek
tradition.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.109
And of course,
anybody from time to time,

00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:45.777
there are individuals who
thought that monarchy might be a

00:50:45.777 --> 00:50:50.569
fine thing.
They ran against something that

00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:57.559
was regarded with much more
hostility by the Greeks.

00:50:57.559 --> 00:51:01.525
When they're through and had
reached their peak,

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:06.249
their notion of monarchy is
something fit for barbarians,

00:51:06.249 --> 00:51:10.872
but not for Greeks.
A free man may not live under a

00:51:10.872 --> 00:51:16.409
monarchy, and the roots of that,
I think, are visible in Homer.

00:51:16.409 --> 00:51:20.898
In passing, I just want to say
that Homer, of course,

00:51:20.898 --> 00:51:24.695
is the basic text,
the basic document for all

00:51:24.695 --> 00:51:29.788
Greek thinking in every area
that you can imagine throughout

00:51:29.788 --> 00:51:34.623
the rest of Greek history.
Over time, it becomes not the

00:51:34.623 --> 00:51:38.199
only one, but it never ceases to
be the best known,

00:51:38.199 --> 00:51:41.559
the most influential,
and the most powerful.

00:51:41.559 --> 00:51:46.808
If it were a religious document
primarily we would speak of it

00:51:46.808 --> 00:51:49.820
as the Greek Bible,
but it isn't.

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:53.685
Well, some examples,
later on in history there's a

00:51:53.685 --> 00:51:58.024
quarrel between Athens and
Megara as to who controls the

00:51:58.024 --> 00:52:01.901
island of Salamis.
They decide to call in an

00:52:01.901 --> 00:52:04.835
arbitrator.
So, they call in the Spartans,

00:52:04.835 --> 00:52:08.073
and the Spartans say,
"Okay, we'll decide," and they

00:52:08.073 --> 00:52:10.360
decide that it belongs to
Athens.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.679
Why?
Well, if you look at the

00:52:12.679 --> 00:52:14.912
catalog of ships in Homer's
Iliad,

00:52:14.912 --> 00:52:17.982
the island of Salamis had its
ships lined up next to the

00:52:17.982 --> 00:52:19.670
island of Athens.
Ballgame.

00:52:24.199 --> 00:52:27.559
You have to realize how potent
this is.

00:52:27.559 --> 00:52:33.406
Well, let me turn to
another aspect of the story of

00:52:33.406 --> 00:52:38.820
Homer and how the poems play
into Greek society.

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:43.129
I want to talk to you about the
ethics and values that emerge

00:52:43.129 --> 00:52:46.434
from the reading of the
Iliad and the

00:52:46.434 --> 00:52:50.456
Odyssey. I mentioned
religion and so we should take a

00:52:50.456 --> 00:52:54.320
look first at the gods.
We are talking,

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:58.239
first of all,
and remember about a

00:52:58.239 --> 00:53:02.625
multi-deity society.
Polytheism is what we're

00:53:02.625 --> 00:53:06.488
talking about.
That is true of all of human

00:53:06.488 --> 00:53:12.246
societies that we know anything
about down to the earliest

00:53:12.246 --> 00:53:15.579
possible exception,
I suppose;

00:53:15.579 --> 00:53:17.320
well, it depends what you think
is earliest.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.773
You could say the Hebrews are
the earliest,

00:53:19.773 --> 00:53:22.401
pure and simple,
but depending on how you date

00:53:22.401 --> 00:53:26.603
biblical things,
there's an outside chance that

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:31.760
an Egyptian pharaoh in the
sixteenth century B.C.,

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:35.719
I think, might have claim to
have some such state.

00:53:35.719 --> 00:53:38.510
But otherwise,
there is no such thing.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:42.567
So, this is a polytheistic
society with heroic

00:53:42.567 --> 00:53:46.410
characteristics.
That is, this kind of

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:50.744
aristocratic outfit,
aristocracy of birth,

00:53:50.744 --> 00:53:57.300
which is legitimized by heroic
behavior on the battlefield.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.105
Now, one of the things the
Greeks believed,

00:54:00.105 --> 00:54:03.460
as we discover from a poem
written by one of their major

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:07.328
poets,
is something so far as I know

00:54:07.328 --> 00:54:12.838
unique to the Greeks.
They claimed that they were of

00:54:12.838 --> 00:54:18.104
the same race as the gods,
and I really don't know of

00:54:18.104 --> 00:54:21.750
anybody else who made that
claim.

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:26.446
And so you will hear Homeric
characters referred to by

00:54:26.446 --> 00:54:29.991
epithets, Homer,
part of the technique of

00:54:29.991 --> 00:54:35.219
passing on oral poetry is by
having epithets attached to the

00:54:35.219 --> 00:54:40.925
rulers to help with the meter.
Some hero will be called

00:54:40.925 --> 00:54:46.480
dios, meaning godly,
god-like, diotrephes,

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:50.633
 reared as a god,
isothesos,

00:54:50.633 --> 00:54:55.989
equal unto a god,
and there are others as well.

00:54:55.989 --> 00:55:00.527
Now, mind you,
notice these are not people

00:55:00.527 --> 00:55:05.285
referred to as god-fearing or
lovers of god,

00:55:05.285 --> 00:55:09.108
no.
They are just about equal to

00:55:09.108 --> 00:55:12.920
the gods according to these
terms.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:17.753
Now, that on the one hand is
this extraordinary claim that

00:55:17.753 --> 00:55:21.301
the Greeks make.
They did make amazingly

00:55:21.301 --> 00:55:26.134
powerful claims for human beings
as opposed to divinity,

00:55:26.134 --> 00:55:30.880
compared to any society that I
know anything about.

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:35.382
This is part of the arrogance
that is characteristic of the

00:55:35.382 --> 00:55:38.409
Ancient Greeks,
but at the same time,

00:55:38.409 --> 00:55:42.904
and right away at the beginning
we're getting to such a very

00:55:42.904 --> 00:55:45.800
Greek thing, a Greek
characteristic.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:50.741
At the same time that he is
this great thing almost like a

00:55:50.741 --> 00:55:56.030
god, he is also not a god in the
most crucial way possible.

00:55:56.030 --> 00:56:01.630
Gods do not die.
Men die.

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:07.181
The mortality of the human
being is a reality and it's of

00:56:07.181 --> 00:56:11.159
the greatest significance and
importance,

00:56:11.159 --> 00:56:15.915
and of course men are not as
strong and as powerful as the

00:56:15.915 --> 00:56:18.393
gods.
And indeed, as we shall see,

00:56:18.393 --> 00:56:22.247
well, the tragic view of life,
which the Greeks invent and

00:56:22.247 --> 00:56:24.750
which characterizes their
culture,

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:29.317
is there right at the beginning
in the Iliad and the

00:56:29.317 --> 00:56:33.286
Odyssey. It says that at the
same time as man is a

00:56:33.286 --> 00:56:37.225
remarkable,
marvelous creature capable of

00:56:37.225 --> 00:56:42.953
all sorts of amazing things,
even unto being almost like the

00:56:42.953 --> 00:56:46.308
gods,
he is nonetheless mortal and

00:56:46.308 --> 00:56:51.280
dies, and he doesn't have the
power that the gods do.

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.090
And what do you do about
that?

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:57.202
Well, it's interesting,
I think, to compare the Greek

00:56:57.202 --> 00:57:00.493
way of dealing with this human
problem that we all have,

00:57:00.493 --> 00:57:04.211
the problem of death.
How do we deal with the fact

00:57:04.211 --> 00:57:07.706
that we will die?
Well, there's what I like to

00:57:07.706 --> 00:57:11.913
call the Eastern solution that
you find in many an Eastern

00:57:11.913 --> 00:57:15.530
religion and philosophy that
says that man is,

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:19.840
in fact, nothing.
He is dust.

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.949
He is dung depending on which
story you listen to.

00:57:23.949 --> 00:57:26.920
So, of course you're going to
die.

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:30.520
Who cares?
Why should you care?

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:33.168
You were nothing to begin with;
you'll be nothing when you're

00:57:33.168 --> 00:57:36.039
finished.
Relax.

00:57:36.039 --> 00:57:41.539
Then there is what I would
characterize as the Christian

00:57:41.539 --> 00:57:44.280
solution.
You're worried about dying?

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:49.582
You need not die.
If you are a good Christian and

00:57:49.582 --> 00:57:53.947
you do all the things that you
need to do to be a good

00:57:53.947 --> 00:57:59.184
Christian, you will not die.
You will have personal

00:57:59.184 --> 00:58:02.643
immortality.
So that's how you get around

00:58:02.643 --> 00:58:04.919
that problem.
No need to worry if you're

00:58:04.919 --> 00:58:07.236
doing things right.
Well, somehow Christians

00:58:07.236 --> 00:58:10.613
continued to worry and we have a
millennium of them killing each

00:58:10.613 --> 00:58:13.989
other about how you're supposed
to worry about these things.

00:58:13.989 --> 00:58:18.592
But if you can accept the
purity of the statement I just

00:58:18.592 --> 00:58:23.530
made, it is at the root of the
thing you have a solution.

00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:28.310
But the Greek tragic view
does not take either of these

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:33.091
routes, which I regard as a
relatively easy escape from the

00:58:33.091 --> 00:58:37.460
problem compared to the way the
Greeks got stuck.

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:41.630
Man is great and they keep
saying so.

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:46.429
He is important.
He is capable of great things.

00:58:46.429 --> 00:58:52.461
He is of the same race as the
gods, and at the same time his

00:58:52.461 --> 00:58:57.880
life is short and death is
final, and death is bad.

00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.652
I ought to say a word about
death, in order to comprehend

00:59:00.652 --> 00:59:03.112
what the Greeks thought.
You know, different peoples

00:59:03.112 --> 00:59:04.719
have had different ideas about
them.

00:59:04.719 --> 00:59:08.230
Sometimes the notion is that it
is just terrible for everybody

00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:12.575
with actual pain and suffering,
and others have a notion of a

00:59:12.575 --> 00:59:17.719
wonderful kind of a heaven in
which marvelous things happen to

00:59:17.719 --> 00:59:19.446
you,
sometimes spiritual,

00:59:19.446 --> 00:59:22.060
sometimes physical depending on
the religion.

00:59:25.369 --> 00:59:29.869
But for the Greeks,
as I think for quite a few

00:59:29.869 --> 00:59:35.670
other people in the ancient
world, death was nothing in the

00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:41.023
worst sense of the word.
You just went somewhere and

00:59:41.023 --> 00:59:44.550
there was nothing.
There was darkness.

00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:49.846
There was nothing at all.
Some few people who had

00:59:49.846 --> 00:59:53.739
sinned terribly and earned the
wrath of the gods would,

00:59:53.739 --> 00:59:59.036
indeed, be tortured in some
special and typically Greek,

00:59:59.036 --> 01:00:03.409
interesting way.
You remember Tantalus.

01:00:03.409 --> 01:00:07.990
He had done a terrible thing
and there he stood forever with

01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:13.234
his feet in the water below,
and above him a tree with

01:00:13.234 --> 01:00:18.130
grapes hanging down,
and dying of thirst.

01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:22.315
And every time he went down to
try to sip some of the water,

01:00:22.315 --> 01:00:25.648
the water receded,
and anytime he reached up for

01:00:25.648 --> 01:00:28.769
the grapes, the grapes were
pulled back.

01:00:28.769 --> 01:00:34.614
That is a Greek idea of hell,
where you got to keep trying

01:00:34.614 --> 01:00:40.765
and you always lose.
So, that's the picture and you

01:00:40.765 --> 01:00:46.349
have to realize that death is a
bad thing.

01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:51.983
In the Odyssey,
Odysseus has reason to go down

01:00:51.983 --> 01:00:58.591
to Hades, and while he's down
there he comes upon Achilles who

01:00:58.591 --> 01:01:00.625
has died.
And he says,

01:01:00.625 --> 01:01:02.660
"Well, it's good to see you,
Achilles.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.976
Say, you look fine.
You must really be doing okay

01:01:05.976 --> 01:01:08.768
down here.
I know that you are a judge

01:01:08.768 --> 01:01:13.157
down here and much respected.
So, looks like you've beaten

01:01:13.157 --> 01:01:15.659
the rap."
And Achilles says,

01:01:15.659 --> 01:01:21.860
"Odysseus, don't say a word to
me about the virtues of death.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:29.985
Better to be a serf,
the lowest serf on the earth,

01:01:29.985 --> 01:01:37.343
than to be a king in Hades."
Now, that's as bad as it can

01:01:37.343 --> 01:01:39.780
possibly be.
The great Achilles,

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:43.280
respected still in the
afterworld would immediately

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.570
turn it in to be a complete
nobody on earth.

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:51.441
So, it's very important.
They faced without any real

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:57.630
retreat the reality and the
negative character of death,

01:01:57.630 --> 01:02:02.824
even as they refused to reject
the significance of life or of

01:02:02.824 --> 01:02:05.337
mankind.
That is what I mean when I

01:02:05.337 --> 01:02:08.570
speak of the tragic view,
and it's very important.

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:13.312
Now, it seems to me we can
eliminate that a little bit by

01:02:13.312 --> 01:02:18.292
comparing it with various modern
approaches to the same sorts of

01:02:18.292 --> 01:02:21.719
problems.
We haven't gotten rid of those

01:02:21.719 --> 01:02:25.159
problems yet,
in spite of modern medicine.

01:02:25.159 --> 01:02:29.096
We live, still,
I think in what might be called

01:02:29.096 --> 01:02:34.018
the Age of the Enlightenment.
That is the dominant sort of

01:02:34.018 --> 01:02:38.717
paradigm of what life is all
about, at least in the Western

01:02:38.717 --> 01:02:43.334
world and a good deal more of it
where the West has had an

01:02:43.334 --> 01:02:46.763
influence.
At the core of it is a belief

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:51.341
in progress, something that was
essentially not present among

01:02:51.341 --> 01:02:52.410
the Greeks.

01:02:55.449 --> 01:02:58.973
Progress in the eyes of the
philosophers of the eighteenth

01:02:58.973 --> 01:03:02.743
century, though they would have
been very angry to hear me say

01:03:02.743 --> 01:03:04.769
this,
was something like the

01:03:04.769 --> 01:03:08.110
equivalent of the Christian hope
for immortality.

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:11.716
The hope of the Voltaires of
this world was that they could

01:03:11.716 --> 01:03:14.949
make the world better constantly
by their efforts,

01:03:14.949 --> 01:03:18.911
and this would be rewarded in a
kind of a way,

01:03:18.911 --> 01:03:23.840
because progress in the future
after they were gone would

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.769
redound to their credit for
having brought it about.

01:03:28.769 --> 01:03:33.593
And that in some sense they
would live on in this society

01:03:33.593 --> 01:03:37.900
which they had improved and made
a better thing.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:42.751
Another aspect that is very
important in this sort of

01:03:42.751 --> 01:03:46.389
enlightenment approach is
individualism,

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:52.960
that the core of everything is
the single individual person.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.275
As we shall see,
this is very different from the

01:03:56.275 --> 01:03:59.451
Greeks.
Now, the Greeks were very much

01:03:59.451 --> 01:04:04.111
concerned individuals and this
is especially true of the

01:04:04.111 --> 01:04:08.738
democrats in Athens.
But even their most potent

01:04:08.738 --> 01:04:14.610
spokesman and leader placed the
goals, and achievements,

01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:18.819
and everything else of an
individual behind something that

01:04:18.819 --> 01:04:23.593
they thought was more important,
which was the community at

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:27.076
large, which,
in historical times was the

01:04:27.076 --> 01:04:30.618
polis.
Well, that's not the way it is

01:04:30.618 --> 01:04:35.130
with the modern world and that's
not the way it comes out of the

01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:38.639
enlightenment,
the individual is the ultimate.

01:04:38.639 --> 01:04:42.311
The enlightenment,
if you go back to its routes in

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:47.032
the seventeenth century with the
likes of Hobbes and Locke--what

01:04:47.032 --> 01:04:53.969
is the ultimate place you go to?
It is the rights of individuals.

01:04:53.969 --> 01:04:58.290
You may not stamp out the
rights of individuals.

01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:03.214
They are inherent in everything.
Either you believe,

01:05:03.214 --> 01:05:09.047
as our founding father said
that we were endowed with them

01:05:09.047 --> 01:05:12.268
by our creator.
They didn't say God because,

01:05:12.268 --> 01:05:15.124
of course, the Enlightenment
thinkers were not so sure they

01:05:15.124 --> 01:05:17.825
believed in God,
but they still seemed to

01:05:17.825 --> 01:05:21.650
believe in something they wanted
to call a creator.

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:25.587
Or if you didn't believe in
God, this was just a natural

01:05:25.587 --> 01:05:29.412
right.
Nature gave each individual the

01:05:29.412 --> 01:05:32.769
right to life,
liberty, property,

01:05:32.769 --> 01:05:37.909
and nobody could take these
away legitimately.

01:05:37.909 --> 01:05:42.645
Well, the Greeks had no
concept of natural rights,

01:05:42.645 --> 01:05:47.650
or of rights that human beings
were given by the gods.

01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:52.069
That is a very important
difference that was,

01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:57.695
you had to act in such a way as
to make life possible and

01:05:57.695 --> 01:06:01.067
decent,
and for the Greeks that always

01:06:01.067 --> 01:06:05.449
meant being part of a decent
community, the polis.

01:06:05.449 --> 01:06:07.869
But the modern world,
to get back to that,

01:06:07.869 --> 01:06:11.293
to this Enlightenment world,
individualism and a key aspect

01:06:11.293 --> 01:06:13.936
to that is hedonism.
That is to say,

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:18.023
it is legitimate and proper to
search for pleasure,

01:06:18.023 --> 01:06:22.764
for each individual to attempt
to please himself however he

01:06:22.764 --> 01:06:25.719
can.
And it turns out that if you

01:06:25.719 --> 01:06:30.477
could take it to our own day,
there are no limits pretty much

01:06:30.477 --> 01:06:33.489
to what he can do to gain
pleasure.

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:37.053
I would argue that there is a
direct line from the

01:06:37.053 --> 01:06:39.889
Enlightenment philosophy to
nihilism,

01:06:39.889 --> 01:06:45.769
that is to say a philosophy
that says there are no limits to

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:50.674
what human beings may do.
What turns out to be the

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:56.301
practical fact is that he who
has the power and the will to do

01:06:56.301 --> 01:06:59.900
what he wants will be able to do
so,

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:04.073
and he who has not will be
forced to suffer whatever the

01:07:04.073 --> 01:07:07.923
powerful impose on him.
And this is seen by the

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:10.980
original nihilists as a good
thing.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.519
What's his name,
Nietzsche, of course,

01:07:13.519 --> 01:07:16.469
said, "Some of us are better
than others.

01:07:16.469 --> 01:07:19.083
Some of us are supermen,
and it is quite wrong and

01:07:19.083 --> 01:07:22.550
wicked for us to be treated as
though we were ordinary fellows,

01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:25.940
and therefore do not tie us
down with these ridiculous codes

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:29.152
of ethics, and morals,
and other things which are

01:07:29.152 --> 01:07:33.380
simply the weapons by which the
weak hold down the strong."

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.409
This was an interesting idea,
but it wasn't new.

01:07:35.409 --> 01:07:40.400
There's a Greek in the fifth
century who says the same thing.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:44.230
There is no definition of
goodness for this modern

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:47.050
approach, no definition of
happiness.

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:51.099
Each individual decides for
himself what is good,

01:07:51.099 --> 01:07:55.322
what is happy.
What it really does is to evade

01:07:55.322 --> 01:07:58.750
the question that I'm talking
about.

01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:02.357
Is this all okay?
If we're all going to die then

01:08:02.357 --> 01:08:05.905
does it really mean that we
should just do the best we can

01:08:05.905 --> 01:08:08.520
at anybody's expense while we're
alive?

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:11.885
Is that a satisfactory outcome?
Will we indeed be happier,

01:08:11.885 --> 01:08:14.613
better off while we're alive?
If we do that,

01:08:14.613 --> 01:08:18.066
the Greeks would have said,
"That is stupid and absurd to

01:08:18.066 --> 01:08:21.520
think for ten seconds you'll
realize that's no good."

01:08:25.649 --> 01:08:31.523
Now, the Greeks on the
other hand had a powerful belief

01:08:31.523 --> 01:08:35.648
in the dominance of chance.
They accepted,

01:08:35.648 --> 01:08:40.655
again, what is a very modern
idea now, that in fact there is

01:08:40.655 --> 01:08:45.662
no divine force or divine forces
who oversee what happens to

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:48.659
mankind on earth.
But, rather,

01:08:48.659 --> 01:08:53.459
things happen simply in a
random way according to no

01:08:53.459 --> 01:08:57.600
particular rule and that's the
way it is.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:03.580
It is not virtue or merit that
determine the quality of your

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:05.531
life.
It is chance,

01:09:05.531 --> 01:09:11.073
and there are several places in
the Iliad and the

01:09:11.073 --> 01:09:14.989
Odyssey that emphasize that
point.

01:09:14.989 --> 01:09:19.160
Well, that leaves the
Greeks with something like this

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:22.160
question.
In the light of human

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:27.973
mortality, the disinterest of
the gods, the chanciness of

01:09:27.973 --> 01:09:34.409
life, what can man do to achieve
happiness and immortality?

01:09:34.409 --> 01:09:38.789
Because he still doesn't feel
happy about his mortality.

01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:43.392
Though he accepts that this is
a problem, it's something that

01:09:43.392 --> 01:09:47.441
he still hankers after.
It's inevitable that people

01:09:47.441 --> 01:09:51.230
should, and part of the answer
is very Homeric.

01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:56.671
It is the heroic ethic.
At a certain place,

01:09:56.671 --> 01:10:00.670
I think a couple of places in
the Iliad,

01:10:00.670 --> 01:10:05.972
Achilles answers the question,
"Why did you come here to fight

01:10:05.972 --> 01:10:09.606
at Troy?"
We know the legend says that

01:10:09.606 --> 01:10:14.872
Achilles was told before he came
that if he did not go to Troy

01:10:14.872 --> 01:10:19.733
and fight in that war,
because his mother was a

01:10:19.733 --> 01:10:26.830
goddess, he had partial divinity
in him, he would be immortal.

01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:30.358
He would never die.
But, on the other hand,

01:10:30.358 --> 01:10:32.189
he would not be great and
famous.

01:10:32.189 --> 01:10:36.529
His memory would not be carried
forward into the future.

01:10:36.529 --> 01:10:39.616
If he went to Troy,
he would die,

01:10:39.616 --> 01:10:44.824
but his memory as the greatest
of the Achaeans would be

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:48.526
immortal forever.
Well, you know the choice he

01:10:48.526 --> 01:10:51.520
took and you know that it turned
out to be right.

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.149
We still know about Achilles,
don't we?

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:56.643
And when we're all gone,
people will know about

01:10:56.643 --> 01:10:59.628
Achilles.
So, we should take the Greeks

01:10:59.628 --> 01:11:03.228
very seriously on that score.
Well, anyway,

01:11:03.228 --> 01:11:06.415
sometimes he's asked,
"What made you come here in

01:11:06.415 --> 01:11:08.724
spite of that?"
and his answer was,

01:11:08.724 --> 01:11:12.066
"Well, when my father sent me
here, he told me a number of

01:11:12.066 --> 01:11:16.581
things that I'm supposed to do,
but the most important of these

01:11:16.581 --> 01:11:20.730
was the Greek words,
aien aristeioi,

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:27.131
always be the Best.
The best doesn't mean morally

01:11:27.131 --> 01:11:30.119
the best in anything like our
sense.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:33.462
It means the greatest,
the strongest,

01:11:33.462 --> 01:11:38.659
the ablest, the most admired.
That is what you want to be.

01:11:38.659 --> 01:11:42.270
Well, you can only do that if
you are in a contest.

01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:46.604
You can only be the best if
somebody is not as good,

01:11:46.604 --> 01:11:50.600
and the Greek word for that
kind of a contest is

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.895
agon,
and so it's fair to think about

01:11:53.895 --> 01:11:57.455
the Greeks, I think it's very
necessary to think about the

01:11:57.455 --> 01:12:00.890
Greeks as having a particular
agonal society,

01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:05.590
a society filled with
competition, in which if not

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:11.057
everybody, lots and lots of
people are constantly striving

01:12:11.057 --> 01:12:16.056
to be the very best,
whatever the definition of best

01:12:16.056 --> 01:12:19.100
is in the context that's
relevant.

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:24.674
Now, I guess I'm out of time.
So, I'll pick up the story next

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:28.384
time with the story about this
heroic ethic and the impact that

01:12:28.384 --> 01:12:30.050
it has on Greek society.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.596
Prof: So on Tuesday,
I talked about George

00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:12.041
Washington and some of the
reasons why he proved so

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:16.219
invaluable during and after the
Revolution,

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.640
and among other things I talked
about the ways in which he

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.240
proved time and again that he
could be trusted with power.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.440
Well, today and on Tuesday
we're going to be looking at

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.008
Washington in power,
commanding the Continental

00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:35.111
Army, as we sketch out the chain
of events on the battlefield

00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:39.010
that ultimately resulted in
American military victory.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.402
Now in a sense,
today's lecture and Tuesday's

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:43.382
lecture--
it's sort of one big lecture

00:00:43.382 --> 00:00:46.492
that I've arbitrarily divided in
half because I can't fit it all

00:00:46.492 --> 00:00:47.480
into one lecture.
 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.949
So we're going to get part of
the fighting today and part of

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.483
the fighting on Tuesday,
and the dividing line will

00:00:52.483 --> 00:00:55.560
basically be however much I
finish talking about today,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.550
as today's lecture and I'll
pick up after that on Tuesday.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.960
As you will see--and I'll come
to that in a few minutes--

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.224
I have basically divided the
fighting of the Revolution into

00:01:07.224 --> 00:01:10.673
four phases--
and I'll explain in just a

00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:14.287
little bit why four phases,
and what that means,

00:01:14.287 --> 00:01:17.054
and why they make sense,
and then I'll sort of proceed

00:01:17.054 --> 00:01:20.093
through them as we unfold what's
happening during the actual

00:01:20.093 --> 00:01:21.280
fighting of the war.
 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.884
And during both of the
lectures--during today's lecture

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:28.066
and during Tuesday's lecture--
I'm going to be looking at the

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.569
unfolding events from two
vantage points,

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:32.915
so I'm not just going to be
looking at how Americans view

00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:34.050
what's happening.
 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.955
I'm going to try to get at both
the British logic and the

00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:40.120
American logic as to why they're
doing what they're doing,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.813
why their strategy,
why their actions actually make

00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:45.205
sense,
because to really understand

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:48.881
what's happening and why what
ultimately did happen did

00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:50.785
happen,
you really do need to

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:53.700
understand the logic of both
sides in this conflict.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.634
Now in a sense,
the underlying question of both

00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:01.739
of these two lectures is:
How did America win?

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:03.349
That's the real question.
 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.120
How in the world did America
win?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.711
Even to people at the time,
this hardly seemed like the

00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:13.968
most probable outcome of this
conflict when it was undertaken.

00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:17.770
And what we're going to be
seeing today and on Tuesday is

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.437
that America's victory,
in the end, was the result of a

00:02:21.437 --> 00:02:23.270
combination of factors.
 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.979
I'm going to talk about a
number of them at the beginning

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.348
of the lecture and then head off
into battles,

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:31.574
now that we have sort of gotten
an understanding of some of the

00:02:31.574 --> 00:02:34.747
major complications and factors
really complicating things for

00:02:34.747 --> 00:02:36.878
the British more than anything
else--

00:02:36.878 --> 00:02:39.226
but I'll start out here just by
listing some of the things I'm

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:41.304
going to be talking about
briefly here at the outset of

00:02:41.304 --> 00:02:41.919
the lecture.
 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:45.608
So a combination of factors
that helped decide the outcome

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:46.449
of the war.
 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.396
One of them is,
as we'll see in just a moment:

00:02:49.396 --> 00:02:51.690
British logistical
disadvantages;

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.830
British assumptions about the
logic of warfare--

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.617
and, as we'll see,
some of these assumptions did

00:02:57.617 --> 00:03:01.060
not really apply well to the
situation in North America;

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.682
George Washington's strategy
and the ways in which it

00:03:04.682 --> 00:03:08.724
sometimes differed from more
conventional Old World methods

00:03:08.724 --> 00:03:11.539
of fighting;
the different definitions of

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:15.366
victory for the British and the
Americans, as again we'll see in

00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:16.400
a few minutes.
 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.990
It meant something very
different.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.250
The British had to accomplish
one thing for victory,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.270
the Americans had to accomplish
something different,

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.644
and in the end what the British
had to accomplish was much more

00:03:24.644 --> 00:03:26.750
difficult than what the
Americans had to accomplish,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.210
and I'll explain that
momentarily.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.628
So British logistical
disadvantages,

00:03:30.628 --> 00:03:32.818
British assumptions about the
logic of warfare,

00:03:32.818 --> 00:03:35.967
George Washington's strategy,
and the different definitions

00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:39.168
of victory for the British and
the Americans are some of the

00:03:39.168 --> 00:03:42.424
factors that helped decide the
outcome of the war in favor of

00:03:42.424 --> 00:03:43.508
the Americans.
 

00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:45.310
Now what I'm not going to go
into here--

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.747
and I will go into it on
Tuesday--which is another major

00:03:48.747 --> 00:03:51.750
factor that helped the Americans
win the war--

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.300
that's the French.
 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.994
That's actually the French
joining the war on the side of

00:03:56.994 --> 00:03:58.050
the Americans.
 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.151
That has a huge impact for a
whole bunch of reasons,

00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:01.430
as I'll talk about next week.
 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.449
I'm not going to go into
that--into detail now,

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.132
but I will say that it's hard
to imagine the Americans really

00:04:08.132 --> 00:04:11.568
winning the war without the
assistance of the French,

00:04:11.568 --> 00:04:13.949
and we'll see that play out on
Tuesday.

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:18.980
Now before we start talking
about the unfolding of the war,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.802
I do want to look for just a
few minutes on some of these

00:04:22.802 --> 00:04:25.665
challenges,
particularly that faced the

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:29.829
British at the opening of the
fighting of the Revolution,

00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:32.790
and how circumstances in the
American Revolution were

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.262
different than circumstances in
some of the previous wars that

00:04:36.262 --> 00:04:37.800
the British had fought.
 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.339
And in a way this leads us to
the first of that chain of

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:42.877
things I just mentioned a minute
ago: British logistical

00:04:42.877 --> 00:04:43.709
disadvantages.
 

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:47.081
In a sense, that's what I'm
going to be talking about right

00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:50.221
now: the ways in which the war
in the American colonies

00:04:50.221 --> 00:04:53.420
presented some logistical
complications that the British

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.850
hadn't necessarily faced in this
same way and with this same

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.060
combination of factors before.
 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.052
For one thing--in a way the
most fundamental thing of

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:04.641
all--was just the simple
question of supplies,

00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:07.519
the most basic logistical
concern of them all.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:09.519
Because, more commonly in the
past,

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:13.629
when the British had fought
wars in distant territories,

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.851
often their colonists had
provided supplies and even men

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:19.540
to the British Army.
 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.694
Well obviously,
now the colonists are the

00:05:21.694 --> 00:05:24.927
enemy, so that's not going to be
happening in this particular

00:05:24.927 --> 00:05:25.360
war.
 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.819
So instead of a ready stream of
local supplies and local forces,

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.668
British supplies and men had to
be shipped over three thousand

00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:37.327
miles of ocean and then lugged
around to the entire Eastern

00:05:37.327 --> 00:05:41.050
seaboard trailing after the
British army in countryside that

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.961
often was not really friendly to
lugging around vast amounts of

00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:47.170
supplies following an army.
 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.815
And as we'll be seeing shortly,
two of the most significant

00:05:50.815 --> 00:05:54.461
battles of the war end up being
lost by the British in part

00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:58.170
because of problems with the
simple matter of supplies.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.000
So that's one logistical
problem.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.815
A second logistical problem for
the British involved the huge

00:06:06.815 --> 00:06:10.670
expanse of land that constituted
the colonies.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.110
Basically, the battlefield of
this war is pretty extensive.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.444
It's an enormous stretch of
land stretching from what would

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:20.836
one day be Florida all the way
up to Canada and for a little

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:24.507
while into Canada,
and from the Atlantic coast to

00:06:24.507 --> 00:06:25.839
the Mississippi.
 

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:29.028
Unlike more traditional wars,
more conventional wars,

00:06:29.028 --> 00:06:31.048
wars of a sort that Britain
would have been more used to

00:06:31.048 --> 00:06:33.822
fighting,
there wasn't one central target

00:06:33.822 --> 00:06:37.060
to attack that could turn the
tide of war.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.690
Now the British don't
necessarily know this,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.112
and we're going to see them
actually try to play out this

00:06:41.112 --> 00:06:42.930
strategy more than once during
the war,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.807
but in fact there was not one
central target that they could

00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:49.569
have grabbed and turned the tide
of war.

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:52.966
Usually, a really good military
strategy was to capture a

00:06:52.966 --> 00:06:55.879
nation's capital or the center
of government,

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.906
and sometimes that really would
help push a war to its

00:06:58.906 --> 00:06:59.649
conclusion.
 

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:02.055
You capture the capital
symbolically and also as a

00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:05.050
source of power and leadership,
and sometimes that really does

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.670
push a war to its conclusion.
 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.069
But in the American
colonies--and then after 1776,

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:14.165
states--there wasn't any one
city that represented America's

00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:15.899
center of government.
 

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:19.990
There was one--no one single
real American capital,

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.920
no one core of American
strength, and so,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.023
as we'll see shortly,
throughout the war the British

00:07:27.023 --> 00:07:30.309
struggled to determine which
major city's capture might

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:33.899
defeat the American cause and
bring victory to Britain.

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:35.634
And obviously,
in the end, this is not a

00:07:35.634 --> 00:07:37.680
strategy that worked in the
American states.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.572
A third logistical problem had
less to do with America and more

00:07:44.572 --> 00:07:48.605
to do with Britain--
and that is that the British

00:07:48.605 --> 00:07:52.230
found it extremely difficult to
raise troops to fight this war.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.310
First of all,
just fighting in a faraway

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:00.050
overseas war would not have been
popular in and of itself.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.701
Add to this the fact that there
were some potential soldiers who

00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:06.716
would not have been that
enthusiastic about attacking

00:08:06.716 --> 00:08:09.355
British colonists,
and you end up with a serious

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.920
problem enlisting men and
raising a large enough force for

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.459
this war.
 

00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:15.021
As a result,
the British ended up hiring a

00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:18.458
large number of German mercenary
troops from a number of

00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:21.019
different independent German
states,

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:23.028
and they end up getting lumped
under the heading

00:08:23.028 --> 00:08:23.970
"Hessian."
 

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.569
That's sort of how we know
them, as Hessians--

00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:30.473
and this practice in and of
itself enraged Americans all the

00:08:30.473 --> 00:08:33.019
more,
because it suggested to them

00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:36.977
that the British were hiring
what they would have considered

00:08:36.977 --> 00:08:40.668
to be foreign assassins to kill
their own colonists.

00:08:40.668 --> 00:08:43.840
Fourth--and related to
everything that I've just said,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.158
and as I said at the
outset--the British and the

00:08:47.158 --> 00:08:50.620
Americans had different
definitions of victory.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.432
For the British to win the war,
they had to stamp out a

00:08:55.432 --> 00:09:00.960
widespread rebellion unfolding
under a vast expanse of land.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.697
They had to destroy the
American cause to emerge

00:09:03.697 --> 00:09:05.269
victorious from this war.
 

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:11.259
The Americans did not have to
defeat the British to win the

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:11.879
war.
 

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:15.594
They just had to keep fighting
long enough to exhaust British

00:09:15.594 --> 00:09:17.700
funding and supplies and energy.
 

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.423
So for the Americans,
the ultimate goal was just to

00:09:21.423 --> 00:09:24.019
keep fighting,
to keep the war going,

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:27.341
to force the British to expend
as much money and as much

00:09:27.341 --> 00:09:29.940
manpower and as much energy as
possible.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.149
And, as we'll see in today's
lecture,

00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:35.909
Washington took full advantage
of this fact and fought the war

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:38.745
with a strategy that maybe
wasn't always really

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:42.744
awe-inspiring for onlookers,
but was highly effective in

00:09:42.744 --> 00:09:45.000
exhausting the British forces.
 

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.572
And then finally,
fifth--a fifth logistical

00:09:47.572 --> 00:09:51.004
problem for the British actually
wasn't so much about the

00:09:51.004 --> 00:09:54.190
American colonists or the
British as it was about the

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.860
British long-time enemy,
the French.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.601
The British could not just turn
their back on the rest of the

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:05.220
world to entirely dedicate all
of their time and efforts to

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.778
this colonial revolt.
 

00:10:06.778 --> 00:10:09.639
They had to keep their eye on
their long-time enemy,

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:13.700
the French, particularly after
1778 when the French joined the

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.629
war on the side of the American
colonists.

00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:18.678
As I said, I'll talk about that
in more detail Tuesday.

00:10:18.678 --> 00:10:20.840
But once the French are in the
war,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.125
suddenly now,
the British,

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:24.080
and in particular the British
Navy,

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.460
have to really be worrying
about what the French are doing.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.357
What are they doing down there
in the West Indies,

00:10:29.357 --> 00:10:29.940
those French?
 

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.328
Do we need to send ships to the
West Indies and defend some of

00:10:32.328 --> 00:10:33.230
our properties there?
 

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.831
That really further complicates
things for the British,

00:10:35.831 --> 00:10:38.578
so they can't just focus on
what's going on in these North

00:10:38.578 --> 00:10:39.639
American colonies.
 

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:39.948
Okay.
 

00:10:39.948 --> 00:10:43.230
So there we're seeing a couple
of different logistical

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.513
complications for the British:
supplies--problems with

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:49.008
supplies;
the problem with figuring out

00:10:49.008 --> 00:10:51.480
where is the best place to stage
an attack;

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.341
the problem of raising troops;
the fact that victory meant

00:10:55.341 --> 00:10:58.265
something different for the
British than it did for the

00:10:58.265 --> 00:11:00.730
Americans;
and then the complications

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.490
introduced by the French.
 

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.480
In addition to all of these
logistical problems,

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.019
there was the simple problem or
at least certainly,

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:12.144
the unique challenges that
faced the British in staging a

00:11:12.144 --> 00:11:14.428
war fought by a citizen army.
 

00:11:14.428 --> 00:11:18.217
The British army was an
impressive force but it more

00:11:18.217 --> 00:11:21.710
typically fought conventional
European wars,

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.038
tended to be fought on open
plains and open country where

00:11:25.038 --> 00:11:28.546
lines of troops advanced on each
other until one line or the

00:11:28.546 --> 00:11:31.460
other weakened from casualties
and retreated.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.551
And that's a war in which you
have men who are disciplined and

00:11:34.551 --> 00:11:37.440
trained to stay in rank and file
as this battle rages,

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.952
until finally the tide turns
and one side or the other wins

00:11:40.952 --> 00:11:41.620
or loses.
 

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.090
This is not the way that the
American war unfolded,

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.774
although it is worth saying--I
think a lot of Americans have

00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:51.551
this image in their head that
the Americans were these sort of

00:11:51.551 --> 00:11:53.628
guerrilla combat folk,
sort of running around,

00:11:53.628 --> 00:11:55.847
hiding behind trees,
and sort of befuddled British

00:11:55.847 --> 00:11:58.666
are marching in their bright-red
coats getting shot down in

00:11:58.666 --> 00:11:59.590
massive numbers.
 

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.047
And the fact of the matter is,
the British were not oblivious

00:12:03.047 --> 00:12:05.633
to the situation--
the military situation and they

00:12:05.633 --> 00:12:08.405
didn't sort of march single file
and get mowed down by people

00:12:08.405 --> 00:12:09.470
hiding behind trees.
 

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.341
The fact is that the British
did, among other things,

00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:15.323
make pretty skillful use of
Native Americans in staging

00:12:15.323 --> 00:12:17.700
their own version of guerrilla
warfare.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.655
So they're not sort of just
hanging on to Old World methods

00:12:20.655 --> 00:12:24.019
of fighting and ignoring what's
going on here in the New World,

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:28.494
but even so there were a lot of
challenges that they faced in

00:12:28.494 --> 00:12:31.028
fighting against a citizen army.
 

00:12:31.028 --> 00:12:33.654
For one thing,
a citizen army is just not

00:12:33.654 --> 00:12:37.788
going to be as predictable as a
professionally trained force.

00:12:37.788 --> 00:12:40.861
Sometimes the Continental Army
abided by predictable military

00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:41.580
conventions.
 

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.322
Sometimes they didn't,
and we'll hear a little bit of

00:12:44.322 --> 00:12:45.009
this today.
 

00:12:45.009 --> 00:12:46.548
I've talked about it a little
bit before.

00:12:46.548 --> 00:12:48.427
The Continental Army--People
were always leaving the

00:12:48.427 --> 00:12:50.009
Continental Army when their term
was up,

00:12:50.009 --> 00:12:52.099
and new people came,
and so in a sense you kept

00:12:52.099 --> 00:12:54.870
having untrained people joining
the Continental Army again and

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.779
again and again.
 

00:12:55.779 --> 00:12:58.567
So it's not even as though
necessarily, after a while these

00:12:58.567 --> 00:13:01.548
men were sort of all long-term
soldiers and knew what they were

00:13:01.548 --> 00:13:02.029
doing.
 

00:13:02.029 --> 00:13:03.350
That was never entirely true.
 

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.908
So a citizen army is
unpredictable.

00:13:07.908 --> 00:13:12.058
Also, it's not just an army
that the British are facing.

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:15.701
Americans, generally speaking,
were prepared to fight if

00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:18.548
necessary, not just soldiers but
farmers.

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:22.308
If the British attacked a
locality, the people there were

00:13:22.308 --> 00:13:25.866
prepared to defend themselves
and their land and their

00:13:25.866 --> 00:13:26.740
property.
 

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.214
We've already seen that just in
the talk that I gave about New

00:13:29.214 --> 00:13:30.774
Haven,
where you have Professor

00:13:30.774 --> 00:13:33.740
Daggett sort of riding out,
and the Yale students riding

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.750
out to sort of fend off the
British.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.379
So in addition to whatever
actual organized army you have,

00:13:39.379 --> 00:13:42.890
you've just got local citizens
who are getting involved in

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.649
whatever's happening as events
and battles come into their own

00:13:46.649 --> 00:13:47.450
backyard.
 

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:51.678
So the British faced not only
an army but armed citizens as

00:13:51.678 --> 00:13:52.190
well.
 

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:56.284
A third challenging aspect of a
citizen army was yet again

00:13:56.284 --> 00:13:59.948
something that wasn't
necessarily a common aspect of

00:13:59.948 --> 00:14:03.470
wars fought by the British Army
in the past,

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.815
and that is--Americans are not
just fighting for defense of a

00:14:06.815 --> 00:14:08.600
realm or defense of a monarch.
 

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.522
Intellectually,
they were fighting for

00:14:10.522 --> 00:14:13.379
political liberties and
ultimately for independence,

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:17.366
which would have felt like a
more inspiring cause to many

00:14:17.366 --> 00:14:18.938
people,
a personal cause that would

00:14:18.938 --> 00:14:21.009
have been something that people
had a personal connection with,

00:14:21.009 --> 00:14:24.885
and certainly gave Americans
some staying power and endurance

00:14:24.885 --> 00:14:26.899
during the war,
so that the cause,

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:27.750
again, persisted.
 

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.720
We'll see even today one or two
low points,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.360
at which point you would think
things might have just faded,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.504
and they don't--and part of it
has to do with the personal

00:14:35.504 --> 00:14:38.870
implications and the personal
meaning of the war to the people

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.519
who were fighting it in the
American states.

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:44.375
Plus, personally,
many Americans were fighting

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:47.230
for their own property and their
own land,

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.529
right?--even more personal,
as I just mentioned a moment

00:14:49.529 --> 00:14:49.779
ago.
 

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:51.908
If there is an army advancing
on your town,

00:14:51.908 --> 00:14:55.570
that's about as personal a war
as it can be,

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:59.004
and again, it's going to bring
people out in numbers and with a

00:14:59.004 --> 00:15:02.053
kind of determination and
enthusiasm that they might not

00:15:02.053 --> 00:15:04.158
have in a different kind of a
war.

00:15:04.158 --> 00:15:07.450
So having a citizen army--the
kind of citizen army--

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.828
the kind of warfare that's
going to be taking place in the

00:15:09.828 --> 00:15:12.105
colonies,
also all by itself presented

00:15:12.105 --> 00:15:15.658
some pretty interesting
challenges to the British Army.

00:15:15.658 --> 00:15:16.019
Okay.
 

00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:19.256
So we've seen a host of
logistical challenges,

00:15:19.256 --> 00:15:20.840
some complications.
 

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.648
I'm going to throw into this
mix three bad assumptions on the

00:15:24.648 --> 00:15:27.950
part of the British that did not
help their cause.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:28.374
Okay.
 

00:15:28.374 --> 00:15:33.207
Bad assumption number one:
they continued to underestimate

00:15:33.207 --> 00:15:34.649
the Americans.
 

00:15:34.649 --> 00:15:37.636
They continued to underestimate
the persistence of the

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:39.897
Americans,
the abilities of the Americans,

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:42.360
the impact of whatever the
Americans were doing,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.533
and right alongside with that
they overestimated their

00:15:46.533 --> 00:15:50.706
popularity among American
Loyalists and the power that

00:15:50.706 --> 00:15:53.700
they had among American
Loyalists.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.808
Now, probably part of that
overestimating Loyalist support

00:15:57.808 --> 00:16:02.207
was born from reports of overly
optimistic royal officials and

00:16:02.207 --> 00:16:04.730
governors,
who reported back to London

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.705
that--yes,
there's plenty of Loyalists

00:16:06.705 --> 00:16:09.080
here, and they're on hand to
defend the cause,

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.065
and when things get underway
the Loyalists will rise up and

00:16:12.065 --> 00:16:12.940
be on our side.
 

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.214
And there were some
Loyalists--there were a good

00:16:15.214 --> 00:16:18.068
number of Loyalists who actually
did join and fight with the

00:16:18.068 --> 00:16:18.649
British.
 

00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:21.080
Again, when I was talking about
the invasion of New Haven,

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.070
we saw just here in the town of
New Haven how some people chose

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.058
to help the British,
others--their neighbors--chose

00:16:27.058 --> 00:16:28.500
to fight against them.
 

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.673
So there were Loyalists who
chose at any given moment to

00:16:31.673 --> 00:16:35.193
join and support British troops,
as opposed to the Continental

00:16:35.193 --> 00:16:36.808
Army or American troops.
 

00:16:36.808 --> 00:16:39.759
But even so,
discussion of really widespread

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:42.158
Loyalist support was
exaggerated.

00:16:42.158 --> 00:16:45.154
And because of these sort of
rosier-than-they

00:16:45.154 --> 00:16:48.801
-should-have-been reports,
British officials in England,

00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:52.495
far from the American scene,
assumed that many colonies were

00:16:52.495 --> 00:16:56.365
basically Loyalist and all in
all you just needed a little bit

00:16:56.365 --> 00:16:59.408
of a shove and things would be
brought right.

00:16:59.408 --> 00:17:01.650
They assumed that probably,
there's a small band of

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.220
radicals that are making
trouble.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.542
You hear this again and again
and again when you read British

00:17:05.542 --> 00:17:08.223
commentary on what's happening--
there's a band of radicals who

00:17:08.223 --> 00:17:11.041
are poisoning the public mind,
but that there are also

00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:14.358
Loyalists who will rise up and
help the British cause,

00:17:14.358 --> 00:17:18.272
so it won't take very much for
this to be pushed into some kind

00:17:18.272 --> 00:17:19.410
of a conclusion.
 

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.707
That's certainly,
towards the beginning of the

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:23.798
war, something that the British
assume.

00:17:23.798 --> 00:17:26.434
The British Army didn't help
matters--as far as the Loyalists

00:17:26.434 --> 00:17:28.542
are concerned--with their
behavior in some of the

00:17:28.542 --> 00:17:30.298
colonies, particularly in the
South.

00:17:30.298 --> 00:17:33.690
The British Army looted farms,
trampled fields,

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.674
paraded their superiority--and
so there were places in the

00:17:36.674 --> 00:17:39.661
South where the British Army was
a little Patriot-creating

00:17:39.661 --> 00:17:40.288
machine.
 

00:17:40.288 --> 00:17:42.710
You had people who might have
been Loyalist-leaning,

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.904
but they did not like the way
that they were treated by the

00:17:44.904 --> 00:17:46.884
British Army,
and so, pulled back from

00:17:46.884 --> 00:17:50.435
supporting the British when they
might have started out leaning

00:17:50.435 --> 00:17:51.640
in that direction.
 

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:51.991
Okay.
 

00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:55.586
So we have underestimating
Americans, overestimating

00:17:55.586 --> 00:17:57.558
support of the Loyalists.
 

00:17:57.558 --> 00:18:01.565
The third bad assumption at the
outset of the war is that the

00:18:01.565 --> 00:18:05.505
British Navy would accomplish
most of the damage and largely

00:18:05.505 --> 00:18:07.901
win the war,
because Britain did have this

00:18:07.901 --> 00:18:10.338
colossal,
impressive navy.

00:18:10.338 --> 00:18:12.311
It was--Really,
what Britain was famous for

00:18:12.311 --> 00:18:15.551
militarily was its navy,
but England hadn't fought a

00:18:15.551 --> 00:18:19.348
long, sustained land campaign
for quite some time,

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:22.640
and when it had fought long
land campaigns in the past,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.994
often they had been fought with
allies who supplied land power

00:18:26.994 --> 00:18:29.778
to complement Britain's naval
forces.

00:18:29.778 --> 00:18:32.371
So as we're about to see,
all of these bad assumptions

00:18:32.371 --> 00:18:34.718
joined with all of those
logistical things that I

00:18:34.718 --> 00:18:36.868
mentioned at the outset of the
lecture,

00:18:36.868 --> 00:18:41.219
all of these together are not
helping the British as the war

00:18:41.219 --> 00:18:44.107
unfolds,
and they all play a role in the

00:18:44.107 --> 00:18:45.450
outcome of the war.
 

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:45.771
Okay.
 

00:18:45.771 --> 00:18:49.450
Let's now turn to the actual
war, to the actual battles.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:53.432
As I suggested at the outcome,
the opening of the lecture,

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:56.019
I divided the war into four
phases.

00:18:56.019 --> 00:18:58.496
As we'll see,
each of these phases is

00:18:58.496 --> 00:19:02.487
initiated by a sort of major
decision of strategy or policy

00:19:02.487 --> 00:19:04.618
on the part of the British.
 

00:19:04.618 --> 00:19:07.992
Often it's a strategy that's
initiated by an assumption that

00:19:07.992 --> 00:19:11.308
makes perfect sense to the
British but that does not end up

00:19:11.308 --> 00:19:13.539
being necessarily a good
strategy,

00:19:13.539 --> 00:19:15.720
given the situation at the time.
 

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.358
And again and again as these
phases unfold,

00:19:18.358 --> 00:19:20.657
you'll see the British make
what to them seems like a

00:19:20.657 --> 00:19:23.487
logical decision and then you'll
see it not play out particularly

00:19:23.487 --> 00:19:24.509
well,
or certainly,

00:19:24.509 --> 00:19:27.368
not in the way that the British
really wanted this to play out.

00:19:27.368 --> 00:19:30.028
So let's turn to the first
phase of the war--

00:19:30.028 --> 00:19:33.773
and we've already seen a little
bit of this first phase earlier

00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:37.578
on when I talked about Lexington
and Concord and Bunker Hill.

00:19:37.578 --> 00:19:41.229
This early phase of the war was
guided by the main assumption on

00:19:41.229 --> 00:19:44.588
the part of the British that all
the Americans needed was a

00:19:44.588 --> 00:19:47.930
little display of force,
a little bit of military

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.460
coercion, and the war would come
to a quick close.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.547
So basically,
just sort of impress upon them

00:19:53.547 --> 00:19:55.440
the stupidity of what they are
doing.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.318
Right? 'We are the British Army.
 

00:19:56.318 --> 00:19:58.868
We will come in and remind them
what they are doing.

00:19:58.868 --> 00:20:01.548
They will be reminded that they
are behaving illogically,

00:20:01.548 --> 00:20:03.828
and one way or another,
this will end--

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:06.335
maybe a little reconciliation,
a little friendly sort of

00:20:06.335 --> 00:20:08.338
gesture on our part toward the
colonists,

00:20:08.338 --> 00:20:10.700
and we can bring this whole
thing to a close.'

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.140
And Lexington and Concord are
part of that strategy,

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:14.680
right?
 

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.931
Just a little display of force
and everything's going to be

00:20:16.931 --> 00:20:17.318
settled.
 

00:20:17.318 --> 00:20:20.230
Of course, the outcome is not
what they would expect;

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:21.318
it's just the opposite.
 

00:20:21.318 --> 00:20:24.400
And the British movements,
the British troop movements,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.776
called forth an outpouring of
American enthusiasm and

00:20:27.776 --> 00:20:31.413
enlistments and alarm,
which was further bolstered by

00:20:31.413 --> 00:20:33.983
America's victories--
or I guess you could call them

00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:34.858
sort of semi-victories.
 

00:20:34.858 --> 00:20:35.930
I don't know what to call
Bunker Hill.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.529
It's sort of a victory but it
sort of isn't--

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:39.910
but certainly,
some Americans at the time--

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.759
I suppose because they weren't
crushed to death--

00:20:41.759 --> 00:20:44.200
would have seen Bunker Hill as
a victory.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.938
But--So the fact that things
were sort of persisting and they

00:20:47.938 --> 00:20:51.738
were standing up to the British
at Bunker Hill in June of 1775

00:20:51.738 --> 00:20:54.480
and at Fort Ticonderoga in May
of 1775,

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.328
that sort of helps to bolster
American spirits.

00:20:57.328 --> 00:21:00.920
Now, I have discussed a little
bit the Battle of Bunker Hill,

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.060
and you might remember that
that's the battle in which the

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.366
British held the ground at the
end of the day but at the cost

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.241
of so many men--
almost half of the men that

00:21:09.241 --> 00:21:11.305
were fighting there that day--
that their victory didn't

00:21:11.305 --> 00:21:13.420
really seem to be much of a
victory at all--

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.608
which is why you can sort of
call it a semi-victory on both

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:17.048
sides.
 

00:21:17.048 --> 00:21:19.609
And I mentioned on--in
Tuesday's lecture that New

00:21:19.609 --> 00:21:22.673
York Times article that I
had stumbled across that morning

00:21:22.673 --> 00:21:25.536
about that bundle of letters
that were going to be sold at

00:21:25.536 --> 00:21:27.746
Sotheby's--
that it had all of these

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:30.968
letters between British generals
and diplomats who were in

00:21:30.968 --> 00:21:33.862
America writing to each other,
not back to London,

00:21:33.862 --> 00:21:36.883
but to each other about what
they were really thinking about

00:21:36.883 --> 00:21:38.009
what was unfolding.
 

00:21:38.009 --> 00:21:40.653
And there's a letter from
General John Burgoyne,

00:21:40.653 --> 00:21:43.803
British General John Burgoyne,
after the Battle of Bunker

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:44.308
Hill.
 

00:21:44.308 --> 00:21:46.483
He's one of the leading
generals in the colonies at that

00:21:46.483 --> 00:21:48.632
point,
and he says in this letter to

00:21:48.632 --> 00:21:51.599
someone else in America,
that after that battle he

00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:54.808
believes that British military
prospects in America seem,

00:21:54.808 --> 00:21:57.568
to use his word,
"gloomy."

00:21:57.568 --> 00:22:01.228
"Such a pittance of troops
as Great Britain and Ireland can

00:22:01.228 --> 00:22:03.900
supply will only serve to
protract the war,

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:08.259
to incur fruitless expense and
insure disappointment...

00:22:08.259 --> 00:22:11.848
.Our victory has been bought by
an uncommon loss of officers,

00:22:11.848 --> 00:22:14.703
some of them irreparable,
and I fear the consequence will

00:22:14.703 --> 00:22:18.118
not answer the expectations that
will be raised in England."

00:22:18.118 --> 00:22:18.317
Okay.
 

00:22:18.317 --> 00:22:19.700
So there's Burgoyne saying,
'Okay.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.400
We won the Battle of Bunker
Hill.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.308
This just doesn't look good to
me.'

00:22:25.308 --> 00:22:27.939
He even says in that same
letter something along the lines

00:22:27.939 --> 00:22:30.614
of: 'When I think back into my
history books and my sort of

00:22:30.614 --> 00:22:33.683
military history past,
I can't seem to come up with a

00:22:33.683 --> 00:22:36.240
situation that quite looks like
this one.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.440
This is just weird.
 

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.394
I don't know what's happening
here, but it doesn't look good

00:22:39.394 --> 00:22:39.660
to me.
 

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.118
It looks gloomy,
and our victory was actually

00:22:42.118 --> 00:22:44.465
pretty distressing,
and it's not going to look

00:22:44.465 --> 00:22:47.000
particularly wonderful to people
in England when they see.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.856
It's certainly not what they're
going to be expecting from us at

00:22:49.856 --> 00:22:51.990
the outset of fighting here in
the colonies.'

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.200
So there's Bunker Hill.
 

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.058
I've mentioned that before.
 

00:22:55.058 --> 00:22:57.910
I don't know if I mentioned
Fort Ticonderoga before.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.518
I'll reiterate it here if I
have, and if not you'll get it

00:23:00.518 --> 00:23:01.480
for the first time.
 

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.856
It was an important battle for
the American war effort as well

00:23:05.856 --> 00:23:08.009
as just for American morale.
 

00:23:08.009 --> 00:23:10.892
Fort Ticonderoga is a strategic
fort in upstate New York that

00:23:10.892 --> 00:23:13.750
was held by the British,
and in May of 1775,

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:18.430
American troops led by Ethan
Allen and Benedict Arnold--

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.390
We're going to have a lot of
Benedict Arnold today.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.440
You could see why he's this big
hero, and thus why it was so

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.490
shocking that he did what he did
ultimately and deserted.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:27.890
He's a hero through all of
today's lecture.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.368
Here he's starting out his
heroic acts.

00:23:30.368 --> 00:23:33.253
At the Battle of Fort
Ticonderoga, Ethan Allen and

00:23:33.253 --> 00:23:35.019
Benedict Arnold are leading.
 

00:23:35.019 --> 00:23:38.305
They actually surprise the
British garrison and they won

00:23:38.305 --> 00:23:40.846
control of the fort,
declaring their victory,

00:23:40.846 --> 00:23:42.744
as Ethan Allen put it very
dramatically:

00:23:42.744 --> 00:23:45.519
"In the name of the great
Jehovah and the Continental

00:23:45.519 --> 00:23:47.660
Congress I take Fort
Ticonderoga."

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.828
These guys know drama.
 

00:23:48.828 --> 00:23:49.551
The U.S.
 

00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:52.259
suffered one wounded soldier.
 

00:23:52.259 --> 00:23:55.009
The British had forty-eight men
captured,

00:23:55.009 --> 00:23:58.808
plus cannons,
mortars, musket flints,

00:23:58.808 --> 00:24:03.003
ammunition--and these kinds of
supplies were really invaluable

00:24:03.003 --> 00:24:05.480
for the American cause
generally,

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.467
and specifically at this moment
they were really useful because

00:24:08.467 --> 00:24:10.250
the Americans take these
supplies,

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.702
particularly these cannons,
that they win at Fort

00:24:12.702 --> 00:24:14.848
Ticonderoga and they lug them to
Boston.

00:24:14.848 --> 00:24:18.130
And they position them looking
down on the city of Boston,

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.618
and not that long after,
the British evacuate Boston,

00:24:21.618 --> 00:24:23.240
right?--which is what they
would have wanted.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.846
So March of 1776,
the British say,

00:24:25.846 --> 00:24:26.480
'Okay.
 

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.240
We lost Ticonderoga and there's
a cannon looking down on us.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.490
I think it's time to leave
Boston.'

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.914
Now as long as I'm in upstate
New York, I'm going to mention

00:24:35.914 --> 00:24:39.398
some bad assumptions on the part
of Americans as well at this

00:24:39.398 --> 00:24:39.980
point.
 

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.930
There was always the feeling in
America--

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.410
and particularly during the
very beginning of the war--

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:49.868
that Canada was just waiting to
be liberated from England,

00:24:49.868 --> 00:24:54.095
right?--that Quebec is just
waiting to be the fourteenth

00:24:54.095 --> 00:24:54.710
state.
 

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:58.327
So after winning Ticonderoga,
part of the American army

00:24:58.327 --> 00:25:01.545
actually went north to attack
Quebec and free it,

00:25:01.545 --> 00:25:04.359
right?--this idea like,
'free Canada!'

00:25:04.359 --> 00:25:06.328
Canada doesn't want to be freed.
 

00:25:06.328 --> 00:25:08.189
[laughs]
It's just these Americans that

00:25:08.189 --> 00:25:10.440
are like: 'yeah,
they're just waiting for us to

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:10.930
come.'
 

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.328
So they stage this attack on
Quebec to free it.

00:25:14.328 --> 00:25:17.078
It's--This--As you'll see today
and Tuesday, this is pretty much

00:25:17.078 --> 00:25:19.130
a defensive war on the part of
the Americans.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:22.000
This is the one little moment
or one of very few little

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.192
moments, that's really just an
offensive invasion on the part

00:25:25.192 --> 00:25:26.309
of the Americans.
 

00:25:26.309 --> 00:25:28.368
Once again, Benedict Arnold.
 

00:25:28.368 --> 00:25:31.328
There he is,
being heroic during the attack.

00:25:31.328 --> 00:25:34.877
So was the young Aaron Burr who
fought in this battle and

00:25:34.877 --> 00:25:37.730
supposedly pulled the body of
his general,

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.148
Richard Montgomery,
off of the battlefield under

00:25:40.148 --> 00:25:41.894
heavy fire--
and since I think Montgomery

00:25:41.894 --> 00:25:44.019
was a big person and Aaron Burr
was a very small person,

00:25:44.019 --> 00:25:45.980
I think this was a hard thing
to do,

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.462
and he became sort of a hero
afterwards for being the guy who

00:25:49.462 --> 00:25:52.828
saved his general's body under
heavy fire during battle.

00:25:52.828 --> 00:25:56.670
Ultimately, the Americans did
not liberate Canada.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.702
[laughs]
The Canadians just were not

00:25:58.702 --> 00:26:01.548
interested in joining the
American war effort,

00:26:01.548 --> 00:26:04.990
not even when a delegation from
the Continental Congress arrived

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.148
in Canada,
led by Benjamin Franklin,

00:26:07.148 --> 00:26:10.568
to negotiate with the Canadians
about joining the revolt--

00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:12.420
so the Americans were serious
about this.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.123
The effort to free Canada ended
without effect,

00:26:15.123 --> 00:26:17.473
and ultimately,
during this war at least,

00:26:17.473 --> 00:26:21.058
the Americans abandoned the
idea about liberating Canada.

00:26:21.058 --> 00:26:23.190
And I say "during this war
at least"

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.652
because during the War of 1812,
when once again we're fighting

00:26:25.652 --> 00:26:27.538
the British,
the Americans are right back

00:26:27.538 --> 00:26:28.710
there: 'free Canada!'
 

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.028
[laughs]
It's like: 'no number two.

00:26:32.028 --> 00:26:34.690
[laughs]
Go away,' but they're back;

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.759
they're persistent.
 

00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:40.874
Now the main part of the
American army at this point in

00:26:40.874 --> 00:26:44.759
1776, after the evacuation of
Boston by the British,

00:26:44.759 --> 00:26:46.358
is not in Canada.
 

00:26:46.358 --> 00:26:49.098
After the British evacuated
Boston,

00:26:49.098 --> 00:26:52.853
Washington and the main body of
American troops went to New York

00:26:52.853 --> 00:26:55.405
City,
convinced that after evacuating

00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:57.400
Boston,
that's likely to be where the

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.083
British head,
to New York City,

00:26:59.083 --> 00:27:02.028
and sure enough that's exactly
what the British do.

00:27:02.028 --> 00:27:05.973
Thomas Gage,
commander of the British

00:27:05.973 --> 00:27:08.054
forces,
had been recalled by this time

00:27:08.054 --> 00:27:09.528
and he'd been replaced by Sir
William Howe,

00:27:09.528 --> 00:27:13.598
who arrived in New York City in
July of 1776.

00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:13.907
Okay.
 

00:27:13.907 --> 00:27:17.544
So here we see another British
assumption that does not play

00:27:17.544 --> 00:27:21.180
out the way in which clearly the
British hoped it would.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.416
I said a few minutes ago,
they assumed a little show of

00:27:23.416 --> 00:27:25.218
force,
a little show of reconciliation

00:27:25.218 --> 00:27:27.272
and this will end,
and we've seen a little show of

00:27:27.272 --> 00:27:27.528
force.
 

00:27:27.528 --> 00:27:30.070
Here we see an attempt at
reconciliation,

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:33.627
the idea being--maybe if we
sort of extend a hand in some

00:27:33.627 --> 00:27:35.088
way, this will end.
 

00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:39.001
So newly installed General Howe
invited an American commission

00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:42.594
to hold a peace conference with
him on a boat in New York

00:27:42.594 --> 00:27:43.298
Harbor.
 

00:27:43.298 --> 00:27:46.220
This ends up being known as the
Staten Island Peace Conference,

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.308
and somehow this--I have no
issue with Staten Island,

00:27:49.308 --> 00:27:51.527
but I just don't expect
that--all those words to go

00:27:51.527 --> 00:27:53.849
together,
the "Staten Island Peace

00:27:53.849 --> 00:27:55.518
Conference,"
[laughter]

00:27:55.518 --> 00:27:57.680
which is held September
11,1776.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.719
At the conference,
Howe tells the American

00:28:00.719 --> 00:28:03.038
commissioners--
Benjamin Franklin,

00:28:03.038 --> 00:28:05.509
John Adams (making a little
appearance),

00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:07.980
and South Carolinian Edward
Rutledge,

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.930
all of them there from the
Continental Congress--

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.849
that he would hate to be forced
to destroy his brothers,

00:28:13.849 --> 00:28:15.308
the Americans.
 

00:28:15.308 --> 00:28:19.160
He's wishing that there was
something they could do so that

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.210
he can be spared the horror of
having to kill his brethren.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:25.271
At which point,
Franklin supposedly responded

00:28:25.271 --> 00:28:27.756
by saying, "We will try our
best to spare you the

00:28:27.756 --> 00:28:28.598
trouble."
 

00:28:28.598 --> 00:28:29.561
[laughs]
[laughter]

00:28:29.561 --> 00:28:31.220
Thank you, Benjamin Franklin.
 

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:31.407
Okay.
 

00:28:31.407 --> 00:28:33.291
That conference did not
accomplish what the British

00:28:33.291 --> 00:28:34.308
wanted it to accomplish.
 

00:28:34.308 --> 00:28:37.665
Nothing happens as a result of
the Staten Island Peace

00:28:37.665 --> 00:28:38.490
Conference.
 

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.310
Howe also wrote to George
Washington to see if he could

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:45.920
get Washington to come to terms
with the British.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.276
Right?
 

00:28:46.276 --> 00:28:49.787
Maybe if I just deal with him
personally, he'll see that I'm

00:28:49.787 --> 00:28:52.999
being reasonable and work
towards ending this before it

00:28:52.999 --> 00:28:54.130
really begins.
 

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.704
Unfortunately,
this is the letter that I

00:28:56.704 --> 00:28:59.980
mentioned on Tuesday,
addressed to Mr.***Washington,

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.489
that he did not want to accept
because it wasn't addressed to

00:29:02.489 --> 00:29:04.050
General Washington--
the etcetera,

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.856
etcetera letter--so basically,
Howe refuses to address

00:29:06.856 --> 00:29:10.005
Washington with his military
title and Washington refuses to

00:29:10.005 --> 00:29:12.700
accept the letter--
so this does not go well either.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.450
[laughs]
That's just like:

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:15.640
oops, oh, well.
 

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.752
That's an attempt that just
stalls before it even gets under

00:29:18.752 --> 00:29:19.068
way.
 

00:29:19.068 --> 00:29:23.578
So there we have basically the
first phase of the war,

00:29:23.578 --> 00:29:27.358
this idea that a little push,
a little shove,

00:29:27.358 --> 00:29:29.029
a little display of force,
a little reconciliation,

00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:31.440
and things will end.
 

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.201
The second phase begins with a
switch in strategy on the part

00:29:36.201 --> 00:29:38.627
of the British,
a new strategy,

00:29:38.627 --> 00:29:41.958
but again, one that's still
grounded in traditional

00:29:41.958 --> 00:29:43.890
assumptions about warfare.
 

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.569
And this new strategy is
accompanied by another

00:29:46.569 --> 00:29:48.960
assumption that does not play
out well.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.034
The little shove strategy
doesn't work,

00:29:51.034 --> 00:29:54.309
so now basically we'll up the
stakes--is what the British are

00:29:54.309 --> 00:29:57.269
thinking;
we'll seize a major city.

00:29:57.269 --> 00:30:01.326
Basically, the British assumed
that if they seized New York,

00:30:01.326 --> 00:30:05.453
they would split the colonies
in half along the Hudson Valley

00:30:05.453 --> 00:30:06.828
and end the war.
 

00:30:06.828 --> 00:30:09.826
To them, it seemed pretty
simple and easy to divide the

00:30:09.826 --> 00:30:13.001
colonies into two halves--
and particularly since at this

00:30:13.001 --> 00:30:16.410
point they still think that the
center of all the trouble is New

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.103
England,
that there are these sort of

00:30:18.103 --> 00:30:19.519
crazy radical people in New
England,

00:30:19.519 --> 00:30:22.298
so if they can seize New York
and divide the colonies in half

00:30:22.298 --> 00:30:25.838
and isolate New England,
then maybe things will actually

00:30:25.838 --> 00:30:26.798
end quickly.
 

00:30:26.798 --> 00:30:30.808
So that's the strategy here as
we move into phase number two of

00:30:30.808 --> 00:30:31.778
the fighting.
 

00:30:31.778 --> 00:30:36.724
So the British descended on New
York with an armada bearing

00:30:36.724 --> 00:30:38.088
32,000 troops.
 

00:30:38.088 --> 00:30:38.404
Okay.
 

00:30:38.404 --> 00:30:41.048
That's just awe-inspiring
numbers of men.

00:30:41.048 --> 00:30:43.608
Washington dug in on Brooklyn
Heights,

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:46.767
hoping that the British would
attack him frontally and that

00:30:46.767 --> 00:30:49.868
there'd be another kind of
Bunker Hill sort of battle,

00:30:49.868 --> 00:30:53.743
but instead Howe carried out
some kind of a flanking maneuver

00:30:53.743 --> 00:30:57.102
which resulted in American
losses of nearly 1,500 men

00:30:57.102 --> 00:31:00.588
compared with British losses of
less than 400 men.

00:31:00.588 --> 00:31:04.266
However, at this point,
Howe made a mistake of a sort

00:31:04.266 --> 00:31:08.578
that he made repeatedly again
and again throughout the war.

00:31:08.578 --> 00:31:12.344
He's so confident of victory
that he decides he won't deliver

00:31:12.344 --> 00:31:14.980
the final death-blow until the
next day.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:15.348
Right?
 

00:31:15.348 --> 00:31:17.259
'Oh, we'll let the night pass.
 

00:31:17.259 --> 00:31:19.470
Tomorrow morning we'll get up
and crush them.'

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.779
Okay.
 

00:31:19.779 --> 00:31:22.078
Washington is the expert of
retreat.

00:31:22.078 --> 00:31:25.104
Overnight Washington removes
his troops under cover of

00:31:25.104 --> 00:31:28.700
darkness from Brooklyn Heights
and brings them into New York.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.088
And we'll see--I think--even in
the course of today's lecture,

00:31:32.088 --> 00:31:34.990
Howe does this again--that he
does well in a battle,

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.420
he assumes that things are
going so swimmingly,

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.130
that okay, tomorrow we'll
finish things off,

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:43.405
and Washington manages to make
a hasty retreat and things

00:31:43.405 --> 00:31:44.048
continue.
 

00:31:44.048 --> 00:31:47.290
So Washington removes his
troops under cover of darkness

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:50.130
to New York City,
and basically for the next two

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:53.119
months there's a series of minor
battles in New York.

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:54.789
There's one in Harlem Heights.
 

00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:56.910
There's one in White Plains.
 

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:00.868
Howe keeps trying to circle the
Continental Army and Washington

00:32:00.868 --> 00:32:03.358
keeps retreating one way or
another,

00:32:03.358 --> 00:32:06.233
pretty skillfully,
helped always in his retreating

00:32:06.233 --> 00:32:09.930
by the fact that Howe is so slow
to just advance and conquer.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.880
Ultimately, Washington fled
across New Jersey,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.808
over the Delaware River,
while Howe,

00:32:16.808 --> 00:32:18.920
who now is in possession of New
York,

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.207
also seizes Newport,
Rhode Island,

00:32:21.207 --> 00:32:24.048
and establishes outposts in New
Jersey.

00:32:24.048 --> 00:32:26.702
So things are not looking
wonderful for the Americans at

00:32:26.702 --> 00:32:29.500
this point, and the British seem
to be doing quite well.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.473
But here we do see one of
Washington's most characteristic

00:32:33.473 --> 00:32:36.233
war maneuvers,
because rather than just sort

00:32:36.233 --> 00:32:38.950
of standing there and engaging
with the British,

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:43.628
he withdraws and he withdraws
and he withdraws again and again

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:44.548
and again.
 

00:32:44.548 --> 00:32:47.911
Throughout the entire war,
he continually maneuvered his

00:32:47.911 --> 00:32:50.601
army so that if the
circumstances didn't seem

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:53.779
overwhelmingly favorable for the
American army,

00:32:53.779 --> 00:32:57.980
he could just retreat to a more
secure spot.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.237
Now obviously the strategy of
retreat would not have been

00:33:01.237 --> 00:33:04.435
necessarily overwhelmingly
inspiring to Americans at the

00:33:04.435 --> 00:33:04.960
time.
 

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.744
It did not also necessarily
strike fear into the hearts of

00:33:07.744 --> 00:33:08.868
the British at first.
 

00:33:08.868 --> 00:33:10.930
Washington's the guy who
retreats.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:14.228
This had some people feeling a
little bit gloomy and not always

00:33:14.228 --> 00:33:14.759
hopeful.
 

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:16.318
He's the army that disappears.
 

00:33:16.318 --> 00:33:20.519
But now in 1776,
Washington uses this typical

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:21.568
strategy.
 

00:33:21.568 --> 00:33:23.700
He doesn't want to get penned
into New York City.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.042
He retreats across New Jersey,
retreats across the Delaware,

00:33:27.042 --> 00:33:28.460
goes into Pennsylvania.
 

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.481
The British head after him as
far as Trenton,

00:33:31.481 --> 00:33:34.915
New Jersey, led by British
General Lord Cornwallis,

00:33:34.915 --> 00:33:37.868
and there they go into winter
quarters.

00:33:37.868 --> 00:33:40.605
And--Lord Cornwallis had
arrived in America in 1776,

00:33:40.605 --> 00:33:43.338
and he brought with him even
more British troops.

00:33:43.338 --> 00:33:47.013
And here we have yet another
letter from that collection I

00:33:47.013 --> 00:33:49.400
mentioned being sold at
Sotheby's,

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.598
and this one's from an observer
who's on a ship,

00:33:52.598 --> 00:33:55.998
a British ship in New York
Harbor, as he's watching the

00:33:55.998 --> 00:33:58.785
Americans leave New York,
and he's writing again to

00:33:58.785 --> 00:33:59.400
somebody else.
 

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.068
He's a diplomat.
 

00:34:00.068 --> 00:34:04.712
He's writing to someone else in
the colonies and he says that he

00:34:04.712 --> 00:34:08.030
watched the colonists abandon
their homes,

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:10.246
quote, "to follow the
standard of rebellion at the

00:34:10.246 --> 00:34:13.510
hazard of all they are worth,
rather than acknowledge George

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:14.550
for their king.
 

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.550
The infatuation is inscrutable.
 

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.050
I have read somewhere,
and I begin to think it

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.438
possible, that a whole country
as well as an individual may be

00:34:23.438 --> 00:34:25.050
struck with lunacy."
 

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:26.789
He can't believe what he's
seeing.

00:34:26.789 --> 00:34:27.106
Right?
 

00:34:27.106 --> 00:34:29.110
He's watching Washington's army
run,

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:33.550
and he watches some colonists
basically follow,

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.969
abandon what they own and
follow, as he puts it,

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:39.369
rather than acknowledge George
for their King.

00:34:39.369 --> 00:34:41.110
He can't quite believe what
he's seeing.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:45.268
Now by this point--this is
December of 1776--

00:34:45.268 --> 00:34:49.969
Washington had roughly 3,000
men fit for duty in the army,

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:53.449
a really sad point for
Washington and the army.

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:56.969
It's at this point that Thomas
Paine makes another appearance,

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:58.469
comes to the fore again.
 

00:34:58.469 --> 00:35:02.898
He writes a series of pamphlets
published under the title The

00:35:02.898 --> 00:35:07.679
Crisis, and the first
one appears in December of 1776,

00:35:07.679 --> 00:35:10.300
actually I think December
19,1776.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.039
By this point Paine had
actually joined the American

00:35:13.039 --> 00:35:15.940
army, so he's in the army,
and he wrote these Crisis

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.090
essays while he was in the
army.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:23.137
And Washington had them read to
the troops to boost their

00:35:23.137 --> 00:35:24.896
morale--
and as with Common

00:35:24.896 --> 00:35:26.980
Sense, these
Crisis essays include

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.349
some of the most famous prose of
the revolutionary era.

00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:31.117
And I'll just read the most
obvious ones,

00:35:31.117 --> 00:35:33.018
which some of you probably
already know:

00:35:33.018 --> 00:35:35.802
"These are the times that
try men's souls:

00:35:35.802 --> 00:35:38.949
The summer soldier and the
sunshine patriot will,

00:35:38.949 --> 00:35:41.027
in this crisis,
shrink from the service of

00:35:41.027 --> 00:35:43.853
their country;
but he that stands by it now,

00:35:43.853 --> 00:35:47.119
deserves the love and thanks of
man and woman.

00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:50.679
Tyranny, like hell,
is not easily conquered;

00:35:50.679 --> 00:35:54.469
yet we have this consolation
with us, that the harder the

00:35:54.469 --> 00:35:57.719
conflict, the more glorious the
triumph."

00:35:57.719 --> 00:36:00.547
He's good at coming forward at
tough moments and then having

00:36:00.547 --> 00:36:02.894
these sort of inspiring words--
again, which is why

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:04.710
Washington's having them read to
the troops.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:08.275
Paine's words were really
needed in December of 1776,

00:36:08.275 --> 00:36:12.389
because it's a real low point
for Washington and the army.

00:36:12.389 --> 00:36:16.079
Failure literally seemed to be
just on the horizon.

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:18.976
In less than three months,
the British had captured New

00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:21.132
York City;
they had captured part of New

00:36:21.132 --> 00:36:23.856
Jersey;
food supplies and pay in the

00:36:23.856 --> 00:36:27.070
American army were at an
all-time low;

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.945
and, almost worst of all,
enlistments of soldiers in the

00:36:30.945 --> 00:36:34.329
Continental Army ended at the
end of the year.

00:36:34.329 --> 00:36:35.864
And so Washington,
there he is,

00:36:35.864 --> 00:36:38.730
and he knows that the people in
the Continental Army--

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.179
their formal enlistments end at
the end of December,

00:36:41.179 --> 00:36:44.268
and they could all just walk
away and say,

00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:45.800
'Oops, my enlistment's done,
thanks,

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.280
Sir, nice fighting with you,
goodbye'--

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.099
and Washington could literally
be left without an army.

00:36:51.099 --> 00:36:55.639
So he does one last desperate
measure literally to prevent the

00:36:55.639 --> 00:36:58.170
army from entirely disappearing.
 

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.003
He uses the only thing that's
available to him at this

00:37:01.003 --> 00:37:03.409
moment--and that is his personal
influence.

00:37:03.409 --> 00:37:07.891
He makes a personal plea to the
army to please stay with him for

00:37:07.891 --> 00:37:11.161
just six more weeks as a
personal favor to him:

00:37:11.161 --> 00:37:12.869
'Please don't leave.
 

00:37:12.869 --> 00:37:14.731
Just--For me,
for your commander,

00:37:14.731 --> 00:37:17.639
just give me six more weeks and
then you can go.

00:37:17.639 --> 00:37:20.614
As a personal favor to me,
who you respect,

00:37:20.614 --> 00:37:22.809
give me just six more weeks.'
 

00:37:22.809 --> 00:37:25.543
Most of the soldiers agreed,
and with that,

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:29.121
Washington made one last
desperate attempt to attack the

00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:31.400
British at Trenton,
New Jersey.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.389
And Washington's strategy is
good in this case.

00:37:34.389 --> 00:37:35.860
He basically waits until
Christmas,

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.949
really banking on the element
of surprise,

00:37:39.949 --> 00:37:43.567
and then he launches a surprise
attack against an encampment of

00:37:43.567 --> 00:37:46.862
Hessians at Trenton--
and he wins the day with a loss

00:37:46.862 --> 00:37:50.199
of only four men and he gains
roughly 900 prisoners.

00:37:50.199 --> 00:37:52.139
This is great for Washington.
 

00:37:52.139 --> 00:37:54.809
This is such a low moment,
and he really does get the

00:37:54.809 --> 00:37:55.940
element of surprise.
 

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.800
The Hessians are just sort of
stunned,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.898
and at first apparently think
that there's a little sort of

00:38:00.898 --> 00:38:03.730
advance guard of Americans who
are attacking them,

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.039
and they suddenly realize to
their horror--

00:38:06.039 --> 00:38:08.179
no, this would be the American
army;

00:38:08.179 --> 00:38:10.219
[laughs] we're in trouble.
 

00:38:10.219 --> 00:38:12.989
And they fight and there is a
battle--but again,

00:38:12.989 --> 00:38:14.579
they really lose the day.
 

00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:16.679
The British,
learning of the attack,

00:38:16.679 --> 00:38:18.239
are somewhat distressed.
 

00:38:18.239 --> 00:38:21.588
However, they think--they
assume at this point that they

00:38:21.588 --> 00:38:24.389
have the American army cornered
at Trenton,

00:38:24.389 --> 00:38:27.309
and thus they decide the next
day [laughs]

00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:30.159
they will attack the
Continental Army.

00:38:30.159 --> 00:38:30.389
Okay.
 

00:38:30.389 --> 00:38:33.001
So once again they're not good
at the element of surprise,

00:38:33.001 --> 00:38:33.690
the British.
 

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:35.699
They keep sort of taking their
time.

00:38:35.699 --> 00:38:39.070
Taking your time was not good
at this point of the war.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.110
It is not a strategy that is
working for the British.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.253
So sure enough,
Washington does what Washington

00:38:44.253 --> 00:38:46.885
does so well;
he retreats under cover of

00:38:46.885 --> 00:38:50.219
night, and in this case rather
than just retreating,

00:38:50.219 --> 00:38:53.621
he actually leaves campfires
burning in their camp so it

00:38:53.621 --> 00:38:56.219
looks as though the army is
still there.

00:38:56.219 --> 00:38:58.630
And then leaving what looks
like the encampment there,

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.768
under complete darkness he
moves his troops away,

00:39:01.768 --> 00:39:05.349
directly into enemy lines in
Princeton,

00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:08.150
New Jersey, which he also
captured.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:09.829
Again, he did two unexpected
things.

00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:12.541
He manages to retreat--he
pretends as though he's not

00:39:12.541 --> 00:39:14.795
retreating;
and then he moves his troops

00:39:14.795 --> 00:39:17.440
into enemy lines in Princeton
and captures it.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.003
Now during the battle,
supposedly there was a

00:39:20.003 --> 00:39:22.800
cannonball that was shot through
Nassau Hall,

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.530
the big main hall of Princeton,
the College of New Jersey,

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.518
and there's a story that goes
along with that.

00:39:27.518 --> 00:39:29.280
There's no actual evidence to
support the story,

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.295
but I'll offer it because
people tell it over and over and

00:39:31.295 --> 00:39:33.210
over and over again,
so clearly someone somewhere

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:35.235
believes it,
and even though it might not be

00:39:35.235 --> 00:39:37.110
true,
I'll give it to you anyway.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.878
The story is basically that
Alexander Hamilton is the guy

00:39:39.878 --> 00:39:42.795
who shot the cannon or had the
cannon shot that went through

00:39:42.795 --> 00:39:45.070
Nassau Hall at the College of
New Jersey,

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.634
the theory behind that being,
he actually really wanted to go

00:39:47.634 --> 00:39:48.960
to the College of New Jersey.
 

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.565
He's fighting.
 

00:39:49.565 --> 00:39:52.289
He is fighting at the Battle of
Princeton--and he wants to go.

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:53.710
That's his first choice for a
college.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:55.429
'Where do I want to go?
 

00:39:55.429 --> 00:39:56.530
Ah, the College of New Jersey.'
 

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:58.150
But he's in such a hurry.
 

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:01.800
He wants to advance through the
program at Princeton as fast as

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.329
he can.
 

00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:05.079
So basically--'I don't want to
have to wait for everyone else.

00:40:05.079 --> 00:40:07.679
If I finish a course in a
month, then I want to move on to

00:40:07.679 --> 00:40:08.409
the next one.'
 

00:40:08.409 --> 00:40:10.070
This is a little bit of a
radical proposal,

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:12.239
and the people at Princeton,
at the College of New Jersey,

00:40:12.239 --> 00:40:16.079
say no, so he ends up going to
King's College,

00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:17.239
to Columbia, instead.
 

00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:19.110
He is fighting at the Battle of
Princeton.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.170
He is in command of a small
artillery group,

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.889
which is firing cannon,
so the story is,

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:28.485
he was rather pleased to see a
cannonball go firing into Nassau

00:40:28.485 --> 00:40:30.570
Hall,
since they had rejected him

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.239
basically;
they didn't take him for

00:40:32.239 --> 00:40:32.619
college.
 

00:40:32.619 --> 00:40:35.710
One way or another,
Washington wins at Trenton;

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:39.786
Washington wins at Princeton;
and then he settles into winter

00:40:39.786 --> 00:40:44.244
quarters at Morristown,
New Jersey, for the winter of

00:40:44.244 --> 00:40:44.929
1776.
 

00:40:44.929 --> 00:40:52.018
So basically in nine days in
the dead of winter--

00:40:52.018 --> 00:40:54.893
and really in the dead of
winter when gentlemen do not

00:40:54.893 --> 00:40:58.039
normally stage military
campaigns in a traditional war--

00:40:58.039 --> 00:41:00.605
the American army pushed the
British back sixty miles from

00:41:00.605 --> 00:41:03.619
their ultimate goal,
which was Philadelphia.

00:41:03.619 --> 00:41:06.699
And, as important,
the battles of Trenton and

00:41:06.699 --> 00:41:11.039
Princeton were vital to American
morale--to civilian morale and

00:41:11.039 --> 00:41:12.860
military morale alike.
 

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.932
As an Englishman said at the
time, "a few days ago these

00:41:16.932 --> 00:41:19.920
Americans had given up the cause
for lost.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.943
Their late successes have
turned the scale and now they

00:41:22.943 --> 00:41:24.679
are all liberty mad again....
 

00:41:24.679 --> 00:41:27.458
They have recovered from their
panic, and it will not be an

00:41:27.458 --> 00:41:30.380
easy matter to throw them in to
that confusion again."

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:35.237
So here ends the second phase
of the war, with the Eastern

00:41:35.237 --> 00:41:40.351
seaboard definitely not cut in
half, the Americans definitely

00:41:40.351 --> 00:41:41.800
not defeated.
 

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:48.309
The third phase of the war
begins in 1777.

00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:51.628
Largely, it consisted of the
British attempting to subdue the

00:41:51.628 --> 00:41:54.364
middle colonies,
once again proceeding under the

00:41:54.364 --> 00:41:57.735
assumption that if they get the
right city it will cause things

00:41:57.735 --> 00:41:58.280
to end.
 

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.159
In this case they think:
'okay, we did New York;

00:42:00.159 --> 00:42:02.260
we're heading for Philadelphia.
 

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:05.277
Yet another major city,
and the government's in

00:42:05.277 --> 00:42:07.965
Philadelphia,
so maybe if we manage to get

00:42:07.965 --> 00:42:11.179
that city as well,
things will turn our way.'

00:42:11.179 --> 00:42:13.885
That's how things happen in a
conventional war:

00:42:13.885 --> 00:42:17.905
capture a key city,
things turn your way often--and

00:42:17.905 --> 00:42:19.449
again,
in America this is not a

00:42:19.449 --> 00:42:20.360
strategy that works well.
 

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.663
As Cornwallis put it at the
time, in the end he decides that

00:42:23.663 --> 00:42:27.021
the only way to really defeat
the Americans would be to catch

00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:29.889
George Washington,
or, as Cornwallis put it,

00:42:29.889 --> 00:42:32.230
"to bag the fox,"
right?--

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:33.960
and so he's on a traditional
fox hunt.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.210
You have to bag the fox and
then it will be over.

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:38.139
I don't know if Philadelphia's
going to do it.

00:42:38.139 --> 00:42:41.027
But at any rate,
the British do head off for

00:42:41.027 --> 00:42:43.782
Philadelphia,
1777, the third phase of the

00:42:43.782 --> 00:42:44.320
war.
 

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.039
This is Howe's plan,
and at first the British do

00:42:48.039 --> 00:42:49.860
well in Pennsylvania.
 

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:53.130
There are actually a couple of
clashes in Pennsylvania at

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:56.052
Brandywine and at Germantown,
and both times,

00:42:56.052 --> 00:42:58.440
Continental Army units
crumbled,

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.309
and Howe was ultimately able to
enter Philadelphia.

00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:03.679
And in these skirmishes,
one after another,

00:43:03.679 --> 00:43:06.742
nearly twenty percent of the
Continental troops were either

00:43:06.742 --> 00:43:08.347
killed,
wounded or captured,

00:43:08.347 --> 00:43:10.880
so the British are doing pretty
well at first.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.869
Not helping matters,
as far as American morale goes,

00:43:13.869 --> 00:43:17.436
is the fact that when Congress
hears that the British are

00:43:17.436 --> 00:43:20.619
headed for Philadelphia they run
in mass panic,

00:43:20.619 --> 00:43:22.226
like: 'ah, [laughs]
[laughter]

00:43:22.226 --> 00:43:25.175
the British are coming.'--
which does not really make the

00:43:25.175 --> 00:43:27.824
Continental Army feel like they
have much faith in them to

00:43:27.824 --> 00:43:28.570
protect them.
 

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:28.737
Right?
 

00:43:28.737 --> 00:43:29.489
They literally leave town.
 

00:43:29.489 --> 00:43:32.630
There's actually a really
amusing letter.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.045
I think by this point Alexander
Hamilton is an aide to George

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:37.422
Washington and he sends a letter
to the Continental Congress

00:43:37.422 --> 00:43:38.510
basically saying:
'Run!

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:41.989
[laughter] They're coming!'
 

00:43:41.989 --> 00:43:44.423
So the Continental Army flees
to another city in

00:43:44.423 --> 00:43:47.429
Pennsylvania--so things are
looking good for the British in

00:43:47.429 --> 00:43:48.309
Pennsylvania.
 

00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:51.445
However, further north
something else is happening to

00:43:51.445 --> 00:43:55.003
the wing of the British Army
that had been in Canada and now

00:43:55.003 --> 00:43:58.625
is headed south,
led by British General John

00:43:58.625 --> 00:44:01.679
Burgoyne in a battle at
Saratoga,

00:44:01.679 --> 00:44:05.496
New York, with Burgoyne's
troops suffering from supply

00:44:05.496 --> 00:44:06.289
problems.
 

00:44:06.289 --> 00:44:09.590
So here we have a battle where
supplies are a major problem.

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:13.018
Burgoyne ends up,
at the Battle of Saratoga,

00:44:13.018 --> 00:44:17.710
surrendering almost 6,000 men
to American forces led by

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:22.400
General Horatio Gates and aided
by Benedict Arnold,

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.452
the man who appears to be
everywhere in this phase of the

00:44:25.452 --> 00:44:25.780
war.
 

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:29.601
For the Americans,
this feels like a real turning

00:44:29.601 --> 00:44:30.239
point.
 

00:44:30.239 --> 00:44:33.876
It's a stunning victory for the
Americans, really unexpected,

00:44:33.876 --> 00:44:37.090
and it's just as stunning a
defeat for the British.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.860
And there's actually a journal
entry by one of Burgoyne's

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:44.159
lieutenants describing the
events with the British

00:44:44.159 --> 00:44:45.744
commander,
with Burgoyne,

00:44:45.744 --> 00:44:47.349
and with the troops and the
surrender.

00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:48.380
He describes what he sees.
 

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.722
And he writes in his journal
"Gen.

00:44:50.722 --> 00:44:54.177
Burgoyne desired a meeting of
all the officers early that

00:44:54.177 --> 00:44:56.309
morning,
at which he entered into a

00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:59.175
detail of his manner of acting
since he had the honour of

00:44:59.175 --> 00:45:00.659
commanding the Army."
 

00:45:00.659 --> 00:45:02.650
So basically Burgoyne calls all
of his officers,

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:05.483
and he's trying to explain to
them how they ended up in the

00:45:05.483 --> 00:45:08.559
situation that they're in,
how--what logic did he follow

00:45:08.559 --> 00:45:10.619
so that they're where they are
now.

00:45:10.619 --> 00:45:14.335
And the lieutenant continues in
his diary, that Burgoyne was,

00:45:14.335 --> 00:45:17.905
quote, "too full to speak;
Heaven only could tell his

00:45:17.905 --> 00:45:19.429
feelings at this time....
 

00:45:19.429 --> 00:45:21.485
About 10 o'clock,
we marched out,

00:45:21.485 --> 00:45:24.375
according to treaty,
marched out to surrender,

00:45:24.375 --> 00:45:26.110
with drums beating,
...

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.891
but the drums seemed to have
lost their former inspiriting

00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:31.900
sounds" and seemed
"as if almost ashamed to

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.699
be heard on such an occasion.
 

00:45:33.699 --> 00:45:37.070
As to my own feelings,
I cannot express them.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:40.994
Tears (though unmanly) forced
their way, and if alone,

00:45:40.994 --> 00:45:44.030
I could have burst to give
myself vent.

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:46.918
I never shall forget the
appearance of the American

00:45:46.918 --> 00:45:48.940
troops on our marching past
them;

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:52.324
a dead silence universally
reigned through their numerous

00:45:52.324 --> 00:45:54.840
columns,
and even they seemed struck

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.610
with our situation and dare
scarce lift up their eyes to

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:01.559
view British Troops in such a
situation.

00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:04.606
I must say their decent
behavior during the time (to us

00:46:04.606 --> 00:46:07.539
so greatly fallen) merited the
utmost approbation and

00:46:07.539 --> 00:46:08.500
praise."
 

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.275
So he's actually describing
this shocking moment where the

00:46:11.275 --> 00:46:14.195
British can't believe they're
surrendering that number of men

00:46:14.195 --> 00:46:16.552
to the American forces,
and the Americans are so

00:46:16.552 --> 00:46:19.083
stunned that this is happening,
that they're actually just

00:46:19.083 --> 00:46:20.070
silently watching it.
 

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:22.677
They can't--No one can quite
believe what's happening at

00:46:22.677 --> 00:46:23.199
Saratoga.
 

00:46:23.199 --> 00:46:25.289
It's a huge victory.
 

00:46:25.289 --> 00:46:28.724
It has important consequences
that I'll talk about more next

00:46:28.724 --> 00:46:31.809
Tuesday as we head into the last
phase of the war,

00:46:31.809 --> 00:46:34.099
which largely takes place in
the South,

00:46:34.099 --> 00:46:37.639
and see its repercussions and
its implications.

00:46:37.639 --> 00:46:39.780
Have a great weekend.
 

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.920
I think lurking somewhere is
that sheet of paper.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.210
I assume it made its way
somewhere.

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:46.960
Whoever has that magical sheet
of paper--There it is.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:47.134
Okay.
 

00:46:47.134 --> 00:46:48.179
Bring it up when you're done.
 

00:46:48.179 --> 00:46:49.389
Have a great weekend.
 

00:46:49.389 --> 00:46:54.000

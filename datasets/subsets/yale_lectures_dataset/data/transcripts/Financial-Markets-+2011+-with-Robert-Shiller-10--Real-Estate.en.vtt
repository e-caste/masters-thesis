00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.230
I'm going to start by talking a
little bit about the history

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.500
of mortgage lending.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.170
And then, I want to talk more
recently about how we do

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.240
commercial real estate finance,
and then, residential

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.620
real estate finance.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.520
And then, if I have time, I'm
going to try to get into

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.850
discussing --

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:53.840
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.110
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: So
when we talk about real estate

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.740
finance, it's really about
financial contracts that

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.830
involve real estate, and that
particularly use real estate

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.080
as collateral.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.310
So, it's a very complicated
history.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.505
But I'd like to put things in
a long-term perspective.

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:31.065
I want to start with
the word mortgage.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.630
It actually goes
back to Latin.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.880
Mortuus vadium.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.130
And that means in Latin,
death pledge.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.926
And then, in the Middle Ages
in France, they substituted

00:01:56.926 --> 00:02:00.090
the French word for vadium.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.890
And that's
[CIRCLES GAGE ON BLACKBOARD].

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.090
I don't know how to
pronounce it.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.310
That means pledge in French.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.190
And I don't know why they called
them death pledges.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.600
That doesn't seem to involve
death to me.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.290
But in the long history
of these

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.730
institutions, it became important.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.290
The Oxford English Dictionary
says the word mortgage entered

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.610
the English language in 1283.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.345
So, we've got a long
history here.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.130
Actually, I can take it back
further than 1283.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.270
I was inspired by the research
of Yale historian Valerie

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.230
Hansen, who has been reading old
documents related to the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.760
silk trade.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.250
And her documents are based on
a trove of old documents from

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.320
the Tang Dynasty in China,
between the 7th and 10th

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.440
centuries, which reflect
loans that were

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.960
made to finance trade.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.690
So, you had people going back
and forth from the Middle East

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.200
to China with silk, and other
items, and they needed

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.700
financing for the trade.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.920
So, she reads these old
documents in Chinese.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.380
And I was looking over her
work a little bit to see

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.370
whether they had mortgages.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.620
She says that in China, it
didn't seem, at least if I'm

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.279
getting her generalities right,
they didn't seem to

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.260
mortgage property, at least
in these documents.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.470
But she says that among these
documents are some --

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.390
they weren't all in Chinese,
because they were trading

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.330
between China and many
other countries.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.620
So, she found some in the
Sogdian language.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.560
She reads all these languages.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.200
It's an ancient language of
what's modern day Iran.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.730
And it's a dead language.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.240
It died out in the
ninth century.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.560
But she finds some
Sogdian documents

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.570
that look like mortgages.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.270
So, some people borrowed money
for their silk trade, and they

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.070
would mortgage their property,
or their slaves.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.810
You could mortgage slaves.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.500
It's an awful thought.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.770
And then the contracts would
additionally say that you were

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.770
obligated to maintain the
property or the slaves.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.200
I guess that meant
feed your slaves.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.513
Keep them healthy.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:45.830
Those were mortgages from
over 1,000 years ago.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.780
So, it's a very old
institution.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.130
But I think it formed its modern
form more recently.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:06.040
And it became a well-known term
for the general public

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.240
maybe in the late
18th century.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.450
I was trying to confirm that.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.710
I'm interested in history,
just out of a passion for

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.490
understanding origins
of things.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:27.330
So, I looked up mortgage on
ProQuest to find, what were

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.950
they talking about.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.550
And I found an article in the
Hartford Courant, dated 1778.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.540
Actually, it wasn't an article,
it was an ad that

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.740
someone took out.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.780
And I think it's kind of
revealing of what the mortgage

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.960
market looked like in 1778.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.010
We here in Connecticut, have
-- did you know this? --

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.110
the oldest newspaper
in America.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.030
That's the Hartford Courant.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:59.530
So, a man by the name of Elisha
Cornwell took out an ad

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.830
in the Hartford Courant
in 1778.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:23.220
And he explains in the ad, that
he sold his farm, and,

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.580
instead of taking the money
right up front, he'd mortgaged

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:34.990
the farm, so that he sold it for
GBP 800 to another farmer.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.680
And the farmer was promising
to pay him.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.110
And if he didn't pay him, he
should get back the farm.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:54.350
The farmer subsequently
mortgaged the same

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.470
farm for GBP 880.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.830
So he's made GBP 80 profit.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.140
Which would all be fine and
good, except he still hadn't

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.420
paid back the first mortgage.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.830
And then the guy mortgaged
it again for GBP 1,000.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.580
And Mr. Cornwell is protesting:
"Hey, you didn't

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.210
pay me for the farm in the
first place, so you

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.090
don't own the farm.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.710
How are you mortgaging it
multiple times? " So he said,

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.840
"I thought I better put an ad in
the newspaper, so that any

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:34.310
subsequent victims of this
farmer, would be warned." So,

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.470
that's the end of the ad.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.710
He said, "this is my farm
because he didn't pay me."

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.540
But this shows how undeveloped
mortgage

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.810
institutions were in 1778.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.690
Because he had to put an ad in
the newspaper to explain that.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:53.330
The problem was that nobody
had any systematic way of

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.659
representing title.

00:07:55.659 --> 00:08:02.360
The farmer, who supposedly
bought it from Mr. Cornwell

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.650
really didn't, and nobody
would know that.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.380
You know, he could
fool people.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.320
I think that's partly why you
didn't see so many mortgages

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.280
in those days.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.690
Because the law wasn't clear.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:24.640
The institutions were not
clear about property.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.970
And so, you couldn't really do
a mortgage business, if you

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.950
couldn't find out whether the
guy mortgaging the farm really

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.910
owned it or not.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:40.770
And so, it wasn't until the
late 19th century that

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:49.300
government started to get
rights to property

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.740
sufficiently advanced that we
could develop a big national

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.310
or international market
in mortgages.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:07.290
So, an important step is in
Germany, in 1872, or Prussia,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:15.310
the government created a
Grundbuch law that created a

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:21.710
system for Prussia that
established in a central book,

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.190
who owns what exactly.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.430
That was in 1872.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:34.580
And in 1897, they made it a
national German institution.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.510
Still, the United States
did not have a

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.990
Grundbuch at the time.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.350
It developed throughout the
20th century in different

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:50.610
countries of the world, that
property rights would be clear

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.550
enough that one could do a
mortgage lending business.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.080
So that's, why I think mortgage
lending has really

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:02.370
taken off in the 20th century.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:07.620
Hernando de Soto was a Peruvian
economist. He wrote a

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.510
book a few years ago called
Mystery of Capital.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.790
And it's about the
developing world.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:18.470
He argued in that book that
property rights, the problems

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.000
that we just heard about from
the Hartford Courant are still

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.430
very big and alive around
the world today.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.690
That you can't easily establish
who owns what in

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.830
many or most countries
of the world.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.810
So, that's a problem.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.070
That's why we don't
see mortgage

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.790
finance developing there.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.270
You can't make a loan.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.360
You know, if you go to some
small town in some less

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.370
developed country, you can ask
around, "who owns this

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.750
property?" And they'll tell you,
"that's been in the such

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:55.060
and such family for a long
time." But if you want solid

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.310
knowledge of that, if you're
going to base financial

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.690
transactions on it, you can't
base it just on hearsay.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.310
Someone else might have
a different opinion.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:10.610
So even today, in many countries
of the world, the

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.500
laws are not developed
well enough.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.860
We don't have property rights
established well enough.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.150
And we have laws that might
inhibit mortgages.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.970
For example, in many countries,
if you give a

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.760
mortgage on a property, in other
words, if you lend on a

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:34.960
property, and the person doesn't
pay, you're supposed

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.680
to be able to seize the
property, right?

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.880
But if the court system doesn't
function well, or if

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:47.400
it's kind of left leaning and
supporting the rights of the

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.410
person living in the home, you
might not be able to get it.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.550
Or it might take you 10
years to get the guy

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.210
thrown out of the house.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.930
Now, it seems cruel to throw
someone out of a house, who

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.110
doesn't pay on their mortgage,
but you have to think of the

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.980
other side of it.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.500
If we don't throw them out of
the house, no one's going to

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.620
make a mortgage.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.290
You have to be able
to get the house.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:07.550
Right?

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.290
That's the idea of
the mortage.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:13.790
The guy doesn't pay, the
lender gets the house.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.270
And so, I think there's
a general process of

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:22.940
development, improving the
definition of property rights,

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.730
and improving the ability of
lenders to get the property if

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:31.760
it fails, which accounts for
the advance of mortgage

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.260
lending in the 20th
and 21st century.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.670
So, that's my long history
of mortgage lending.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:55.085
But I want to get into some
specific institutions.

00:12:55.085 --> 00:12:55.250
I said, I would start with
commercial real estate and

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.520
then I'll move to single-family
homes or

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.650
residential real estate.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.510
I will to talk now mostly
about the United States.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:09.040
There's just too many countries
to think about.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.620
One thing about finance is that
it tends to develop a

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.380
sort of tradition, and a sort
of standard contract.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.620
It's encouraged by laws
and regulators.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.670
You have to do the same sort of
contract that other people

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.330
are doing in your country.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.360
And I think the standardization
is kind of a

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.110
limitation.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.120
We can't be creative in
financing, because the public

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.600
and the regulators will not be
receptive to new things.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.620
Let me talk about some of the
institutions in finance in the

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.350
United States.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.610
It's natural to start with
commercial real estate.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.900
So, you see a lot
of buildings.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.080
My question is, how
are they owned?

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.070
I don't know whether you
think about this.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:55.460
Who owns these buildings?

00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:03.790
In much of the 20th century and
still today, they tend to

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.220
be owned as partnerships.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.350
Real estate partnerships, which
is different from a

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.400
corporation.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.270
In a corporation --

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.600
we talked about that yesterday
[correction: last class]--

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.130
you might sell shares on the
stock exchange if it's public.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.385
And it's defined as
a legal person.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:30.290
And it has limited liability,
so that all the shareholders

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.710
don't have to worry about
being sued as a result.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.980
But a partnership
is different.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:41.740
And most real estate, that's not
part of a larger business,

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.370
is owned in a partnership,
rather than a corporation.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.420
And the reason is that they're
taxed more favorably.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:54.710
Corporations have to pay a
corporate profits tax.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.880
They're double-taxed.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.240
You as an individual pay
an income tax, and your

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.660
corporation pays a corporate
income tax, or corporate

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.240
profits tax.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.700
So, you're taxed twice.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.260
If you incorporate yourself, or
you set up some friends to

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.830
do business in a corporation,
you get taxed twice.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.750
So, you don't like that,
and obviously you

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.450
try to avoid that.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:24.070
The way to avoid it is not to
have a corporation, but a

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.320
partnership.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.900
The law allows you to form

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.220
partnerships to own a building.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.440
So, you're building like
360 State Street.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.300
It's a new building that just
went up in New Haven.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.800
You know this building?

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.570
The biggest construction.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.650
Does anyone know who owns it?

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:46.790
It's probably a partnership.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.345
I haven't investigated that.

00:15:53.826 --> 00:15:58.050
Or it's called a Direct
Participation Program.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:05.320
So, the partnership is an
investment that is offered

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.230
only to accredited investors.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:12.020
It's not generally available
to the general public.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.850
And what is an accredited
investor?

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.980
The Securities and Exchange
Commission takes it upon

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:25.109
itself to define, who are
accredited investors that

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:29.079
don't need the protections
of the SEC.

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:33.970
Basically, accredited investors
are wealthy people.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:40.150
And it's defined in the SEC
laws who is accredited.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:46.600
You have to have at least $1
million, or minimum income.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.300
And so, if you are an accredited
investor, you can

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.550
invest in a DPP.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:01.400
And then, the income of the
property flows through to you

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.140
as your personal income.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:08.350
It's not corporate income,
so it's taxed only once.

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.920
Think about that.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.570
Well, why would anyone want
to form a corporation?

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:13.960
Because I don't want
to be taxed twice.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.980
So, why don't we do all business
as a DPP, as a

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.360
partnership?

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.980
The problem is that the
government doesn't want you to

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.480
do that, and so they have rules
about what can form a

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.230
partnership.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:32.260
One of the rules is that they
have to have a limited life.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.310
So, a corporation
goes on forever.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.260
And it derives a lot of its
value from the fact that it

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.920
lives forever.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.290
There's no end date.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.800
So, we talked about that when I
when I brought up the first

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.976
real corporation, the Dutch
East India Company.

00:17:50.976 --> 00:17:54.650
The reason it got so valuable
is, people could see that this

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.890
was growing as the first
multinational --

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.270
It is this huge company that
had all kinds of deals and

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.360
alliances and business
arrangements.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.280
And no one wanted that to end.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.600
The value came in the growth
prospects for that.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.910
But a DPP has to end.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.170
It's well-designed
for a building.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:18.080
You buy the building, and you
depreciate it over the life of

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.710
the contract.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.030
And then there's an end date,
and at the end date you sell

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.810
the building to someone
else, and then you

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.910
close down the DPP.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.440
You don't hear about these
partnerships as much.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.290
You hear about corporations
all the time.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.150
You don't hear about DPP's.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.030
First of all, because they
don't get so big.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.810
They're typically
one building.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.670
360 State, for example.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:47.750
And it only lasts for 10, 20
years, then it's gone.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.930
So, it doesn't get advertised
in the public, because it's

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.080
not available to the public.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.500
They can't go around trying to
bring you in as an investor,

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.960
because they have to
verify that you're

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.240
an accredited investor.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.500
So, it tends to be a project
for wealthy people.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.470
Now, I mentioned that
corporations

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.150
have limited liability.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.350
Partnerships do not,
in general.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.830
But you can have a partnership
that involves

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.960
two classes of partners.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.850
There's a general partner that
runs the business and does not

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.100
have limited liability.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.760
In other words, if the business
goes bad and loses

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.150
money, the general partner
can get sued.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.560
But there are other partners,
called limited partners, and

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.960
they have to be passive
investors.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.960
And they have limited
liability.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:47.980
So what often happens, is a DPP
is created by someone who

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.000
understands and knows
real estate.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.050
Let's get 360 State
Street built.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.010
You're going to know that
eventually, because once they

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.070
open, they're going to open a
supermarket on the first floor

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:59.510
of 360 State.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.280
And I bet some of you
will be over there.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.580
It would be the closest
supermarket to Yale

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.690
University.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.420
But it's all part of
somebody's plan.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.550
There was some general partner
who thought up this structure,

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:21.630
and got limited partners in, and
is managing the building,

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:25.100
or hires a manager for the
building, and has a plan and a

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.440
close out plan.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.290
The building won't disappear,
but they'll sell

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.710
it to someone else.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.830
I really don't know
the financing

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.350
structure of 360 State.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.110
But I'm just pointing
out, it's likely

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.390
what's happened there.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:42.710
So, that has been the modern
structure of real estate.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:48.250
And if they mortgage the
building, the DPP would

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.285
mortgage the building on
behalf of the partners.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:21:05.210
So, real estate finance in
the United States --

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.560
I might as well write it down.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:19.355
DPP is a Direct Participation
Program.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:28.230
And it's direct, in the sense
that you as an investor are

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:31.520
participating directly
in the profits of it.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.835
You are a partner, you are
not a shareholder.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:45.560
The DPPs became criticized in
the 20th century, because

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.340
small investors couldn't
access these.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.540
Small investors were confined,
because they weren't

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.640
accredited, they weren't big
enough or important enough.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.250
They were not allowed
to invest in these.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.330
It was supposed to be to
protect them, I guess.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.270
But how does it protect them
to subject them to

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.840
double-taxation?

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.710
So, it became a cause that why
in the United States do we

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.950
have most of our investors
closed out of these lucrative

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.820
investment opportunities?

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.010
Basically, individuals couldn't
invest in commercial

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.600
real estate.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.490
And people said, well people
are supposed to diversify,

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.020
they are supposed to hold
different kinds of

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.250
investments.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:35.330
So, why would this be
limited to them?

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:40.660
So, Congress in the United
States, in 1960, created

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.910
something new called a real --

00:22:43.910 --> 00:23:00.970
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:09.455
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: Real
Estate Investment Trusts.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:17.330
Or abbreviated REITs.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:23.710
These were created in 1960 by
an act of the U.S. Congress.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.110
And it was another
example of the

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:30.030
democratization of finance.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.000
And I believe it started here
in the United States.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.590
Now, they're being copied
all over the world.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.630
They got off to kind of a slow
start after 1960, but they

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.335
have grown dramatically.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:58.690
The idea is that we will allow
a trust to create investments

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:02.360
for the general public,
for small investors.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.410
And they won't be double-taxed,
either.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:10.920
So, a Real Estate Investment
Trust has to follow the law,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.770
and then it can invest
in buildings.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.650
So, maybe 360 State is
owned by a REIT.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:16.900
I don't know.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.530
But they are not subject to
the corporate profits tax.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:31.220
Now once again, once Congress
creates a vehicle that's not

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.370
taxed, everyone is going to ask,
well, I want my company

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.150
to be a REIT.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:38.570
So, they had to define
it so that

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.710
isn't generally available.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.190
It's limited to real estate.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:48.040
So the law says, 75% of the
assets of the company have to

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.230
be in real estate or cash.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:56.860
75% of the income has to
be from real estate.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.990
90% of their income must be
from real estate dividend,

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:03.390
interest, and capital gains.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.080
This is all, I think, in your
textbook Fabozzi et al.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.710
95% of the income must
be paid out.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.230
And there has to be a
long-term holder.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.680
No more than 30% of the income
can be from the sale of

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.910
properties held less
than four years.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:26.350
They don't want real estate
churning companies.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.310
So, if you define
[correction: satisfy]

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:30.860
all of that, you've
got a REIT.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:36.000
So, that invention, which
goes back to 1960 --

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.120
It's one of those things
in finance.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.250
It starts out slowly, and most
people don't hear of it, and

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.010
then it starts to grow.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.550
And now they're everywhere
around the world.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.050
Well, maybe not everywhere,
but in many

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.960
countries we have REITs.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.100
The U.S. REITs grew in a
succession of booms. The first

00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:00.760
boom was in the late 1960s, when
the interest rates in the

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.120
United States rose above
deposit ceilings.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.830
There used to be ceilings that
the government imposed on

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.690
savings banks deposit rates.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.780
And so suddenly, the REITS were
paying better than the

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.570
savings bank, and the public
flocked to them.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:18.550
There was a second boom, after
the tax reform of 1986

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:25.130
eliminated some tax advantages
of DPPs, partnerships.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.060
It used to be that the
government allowed generous

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.840
depreciation allowances
for partnerships.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.490
And people would invest in
buildings just as tax dodges.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:37.340
Because if you're allowed to
depreciate the building very

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.930
effectively, you can kind of
cook your profits, so that

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:42.630
it's not taxable.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:46.990
And so, people we're investing
in buildings too much.

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:50.910
The government created a
distortion that encouraged too

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.700
much investment in DPPs.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:27:02.260
So in 1986, the government
eliminated a lot of the

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.170
advantages of partnerships.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:08.070
And that caused the
second REIT boom.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.290
And then, it was starting in the
1990s with the real estate

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:18.790
boom that suddenly lots of new
kinds of REITs appeared.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.790
And REITs that involved
specialized

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.040
properties, and the like.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:28.120
Now they're big, and everyone
talks about them.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.870
But it's interesting to me that
it took 50 years to get

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:34.020
as big as they are now.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:39.740
And the recurring theme here
-- a couple of them --

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.310
One is that the finance industry
finds it difficult to

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:47.030
innovate, and innovations take
many years to happen.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:51.020
And secondly, that there there's
a trend toward the

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.380
democratization of finance.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.550
That if you go back in history,
you'll find these

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:59.220
same mortgages and partnerships
and the like, but

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.420
they were limited to a small
number of wealthy people.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.780
And we're moving.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.190
With the invention of REITs
for example, more and more

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.440
people are getting involved.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.070
So, that's commercial
real estate.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:16.650
I want to talk now about
residential real estate, which

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.330
is actually bigger.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.830
There are more houses than there
are office buildings in

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.640
this country.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.350
Or there's more value
in houses.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.350
So this is bigger.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.500
In the United States, about
2/3 of households

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.280
own their own home.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.710
It varies across countries,
but there are many other

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:41.670
countries with similarly high
home ownership rates.

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:45.330
And this home ownership is a
product of government policy

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:49.790
that encourages mortgage
lending.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.090
So, I want to talk a little
bit about the history of

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.880
mortgage lending, and the
history of problems in

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.710
mortgage lending.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:01.330
I already took you back to the
silk trade in the Tang

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.100
Dynasty, but I'm going to
be less so far back.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:08.900
I'm going to talk about the
United States and the Great

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.340
Depression.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.330
So, the Great Depression.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:18.780
The United States in the 1930s
after the 1929 Stock Market

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:23.440
Crash was faced with a severe
housing crisis.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.800
Home prices were falling, and
people were defaulting on

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.980
their mortgages in
great numbers.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.090
In fact, the government had to
create what they called the

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:38.230
Homeowners Loan Corporations to
bail people out, and they

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:42.070
ended up bailing out 20%
of American homeowners.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.050
It was a terrible crisis, and
so, what was happening?

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.100
I am pointing this out, because
it's important in the

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.810
history of real estate
finance.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:58.300
Before the Great Depression,
mortgages were growing.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.270
Before the Great Depression,
they tended to be two to five

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:08.770
years, and they were
balloon payment.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.410
What do I mean by that?

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:14.650
When you bought a house in 1920,
you would go to a bank

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:18.080
and they would give you a loan
for two to five years.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:22.300
So, if you bought a house for
$10,000, they would typically

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.380
lend you half the money.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.390
They would lend you $5,000.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:29.970
And the loan would say, you pay
interest every month until

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:37.640
two years has ended, and then
you'd repay the $5,000.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.040
And then, you can try to
get another mortgage.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.250
You come back to us and
we'll do it again, if

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.370
we feel like it.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:44.700
That was the deal.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.610
Banks offered that, and it was
becoming an increasingly

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:48.350
common thing.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.540
When we say a balloon payment,
what we mean

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.570
is, it's really big.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:55.230
Balloons are big.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.860
So, you're paying monthly
interest, but then in two

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:02.740
years you have got to come
up with the whole $5,000.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.300
But people thought, it's all
right, I'll just go back to

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.130
the bank, or maybe I'll
go to another bank.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:13.010
You know I can go wherever I
want and I can borrow $5,000.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.900
So, this was the way
things were done.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.250
But what happened in the
Great Depression?

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:19.610
Two things happened.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:25.910
Unemployment rate went up to
25%, A. B, home prices fell in

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.010
many cases by more than half.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:33.040
So, if you borrowed $5,000
against a $10,000 home, your

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.450
home might be worth
only $4,000 now.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.990
So, what do you do now?

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.360
You go to a bank.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.870
Two years is up.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:43.540
I have got to refinance
my mortgage.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.110
I go back to the bank.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.000
I show up and I say, A, I'm
unemployed and my house is

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.790
worth $4,000.

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:54.310
The bank says no dice, you're
not going to get renewed.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.050
So, what happens?

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:58.830
You're forced to dump your
house on the market.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.180
You declare bankruptcy.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.270
You've lost everything.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:05.840
You've lost your $5,000
down payment.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.380
If you buy a $10,000 house, and
you borrow $5,000, then

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.810
the other sum is called
your down payment.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:13.900
So, that's what happened.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.485
It was happening to millions
of Americans.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:22.810
So, the Roosevelt Administration
decided that

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.060
there was something wrong with
the old kind of mortgage.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:37.270
So, in 1934, a year after
Franklin Roosevelt became

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:46.460
President, they set up
the Federal Housing

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.710
Administration.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:33:00.050
And it was trying to get lenders
back in to lend to

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:03.130
homeowners, because it was a
catastrophe in the country.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:06.540
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.080
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: So,
in order to get lenders back

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.280
in, the FHA started insuring
mortgages.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:17.220
And that meant that if you're
a mortgage lender, and the

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.630
person you lent the money to
doesn't repay you, and the

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:21.909
house isn't worth enough --

00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:23.750
you can get the house, but
sometimes you might lose

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.080
money, because the house
has lost value --

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.060
the government will
make it up.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:31.000
So, the government came
in with what's

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.710
called mortgage insurance.

00:33:37.719 --> 00:33:41.330
And at the same time, the
government said all mortgages

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:48.429
that are insured by the FHA must
be 15 years or longer.

00:33:48.429 --> 00:33:53.219
And so, the U.S. government
imposed the long-term mortgage

00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:56.080
on the mortgage industry.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.429
And they said, this is better.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:04.800
And secondly, it cannot be a
balloon payment mortgage.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.580
The government said, this is
really imposing too much on

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.240
ordinary people that they have
to come up with a huge sum of

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.930
money at the end of
the mortgage.

00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:18.690
So, they required that the
mortgages be 15-year

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:19.940
amortizing.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:28.910
Such mortgages had been offered
already by some banks

00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:32.700
in the United States in the
1920s, but it was innovative

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.740
finance, and too complicated
for most people.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.480
They never caught on.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:44.290
To amortize means to pay
down the balance.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:49.460
So, an amortizing mortgage has
no balloon payment at the end.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:54.910
A 15-year amortizing mortgage
has a fixed monthly payment.

00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:57.110
You make it every
single month.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:59.360
And at the end, you're done.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.550
You take your spouse out to
dinner and you say, we paid

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.560
off our mortgage, we're done.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.470
So, there's no family
crisis at the end.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.350
It's a fixed monthly payment.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:14.310
Now the arithmetic of amortizing
mortgages is a

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:19.580
little confusing to some people,
and in 1934, it took

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.170
some education.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.020
But I want to just describe the

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:28.655
amortizing mortgage system.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:40.120
So, we're going to have a
mortgage of maturity --

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:48.560
The maturity of the mortgage is
in M, and that's in months.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:53.010
So, in 1934, they started out
with 15-year mortgages, which

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.700
I thought was pretty aggressive,
but by the early

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:01.240
1950s, the FHA was emphasizing
30-year mortgages.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.610
That's a long time to pay
off on your house.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:07.850
But the idea is, you know,
you're typical family, they

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.440
get married, and they're buying
their first house,

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.420
they're 25 years old.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.840
So, let's give them a full 30
years to pay off the mortgage.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.420
They'll be 55.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.540
Kids will be going
off to college.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:21.670
They'll still be working.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.200
That's a comfortable
length of time.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.420
Why not give them 30 years?

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.980
And we guarantee the interest
rate for 30 years.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.320
No surprises.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.580
You just know you have
this monthly payment.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.810
The question now is, how do we
decide on the monthly payment?

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:46.380
The idea of an amortizing
mortgage is that you have a

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.010
fixed payment every month.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:50.720
You have an interest rate.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.940
And you want to make sure that
the present value of the

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.500
monthly payments equals
the mortgage

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.180
balance at the beginning.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:07.620
So, the initial mortgage
balance, that's the amount you

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:15.080
borrow, has to equal present
discounted value of all the

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:15.960
monthly payments.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.340
So, what will I call the
monthly payment?

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.694
Let's call the monthly
payment x, it's the

00:37:22.694 --> 00:37:23.960
monthly payment in dollars.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:35.040
So, the mortgage balance is
equal to x all over r over 12,

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:47.400
where r is the annual interest
rate, times 1 minus 1 all over

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:55.310
1 plus r over 12 to
the Mth power.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:58.370
That's just the annuity
formula.

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.730
So, that's the formula that's
used to compute --

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.410
I've shown you that
formula before.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:18.730
It's the present value of a
stream of payments equal to x.

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:19.790
Did I write r over 2?

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:25.970
I meant r over 12.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.520
So, what you have to do if you
are calculating an amortizing

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:35.290
mortgage, if the person is
borrowing the mortgage

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:42.190
balance, and I quote a rate r
per year, I have to plug that

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.840
into the present value formula,
and find out what

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.610
monthly payment x makes the
present value equal to the

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.350
amount loaned.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:53.880
Now, that is a little bit of
arithmetic that mortgage

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.050
lenders would have had
trouble doing.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.340
It is not that hard
to do, right?

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:03.550
But I have here a page from
a mortgage table.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:06.800
I found this in the
Yale Library.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.340
Can you read that?

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.700
This is from a 50-year-old
book.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:15.080
This is before they
had computers.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.490
And so, it was too hard to
do this calculation.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.880
Can you read it in the back?

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.720
Sort of.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.220
This is for a 10-year
mortgage.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.060
I just picked 10 years.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.040
That was uncommon, that's
rather short.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.080
Some people would get
shorter mortgages,

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.210
especially older people.

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:35.130
You know if you're 60
years old, you don't

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.790
want a 30-year mortgage.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:39.550
You probably won't
live that long.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.430
So, they did give out shorter
mortgages as well.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:47.110
So, this is the page from a
mortgage book for 10 years,

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.580
and this is for a 5% mortgage.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:59.050
So, it shows the monthly
payment for $1,000.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:03.290
If someone's borrowing $5,000,
you'd multiply this by five.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:08.150
They show it for
around $1,000.

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:15.830
And the monthly payment
per $1,000 is $10.61.

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:21.420
So, what they've done is they've
found out $10.61 is

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.930
the x that makes this
present value for r

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:28.070
equal 5% equal to $1,000.

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:31.640
They've done exactly
this calculation.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:36.360
Now, they show the payments
schedule.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.420
The payment every
month is $10.61.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:44.260
But what this table shows,
is the break down between

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:50.340
amortization and interest. So,
it shows the principal for

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.320
each month.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.440
So, at the beginning you
borrow $1,000 on this

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:03.640
mortgage, and you're paying
$10.61 per month.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.090
So, each month your
balance goes down.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:09.080
In this balance column,
they subtract --

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.970
well, the question is, how
do you figure it out?

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.370
You're paying $10.61 per month,
but part of that is

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.580
interest. What part of
that is interest?

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:24.760
Well it's 5% divided
by 12 of the $1,000

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.140
balance at the beginning.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:32.390
Your initial interest is $4.17,
so your principle is

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:37.320
the $10.61 minus the interest.
So then, that

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.190
reduces your balance.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:43.820
So, the initial interest is
$4.17, the principal is $6.44,

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:49.960
then the balance is $993.56
after one month.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.150
The next month, they figure what
fraction of your payment

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:58.160
is interest by multiplying 5%
over 12 times the balance,

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:07.960
$993.56, and then that comes out
to be $4.14 interest. You

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.310
see the interest is going to be
going down, because you're

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:11.630
paying off the loan.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:15.720
But your payment is fixed, so
the payment against principal

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.810
is going up.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:21.630
So, the first month was $4.17
interest, the next month is

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:23.880
$4.14 interest.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:29.350
Offsetting that is in the first
month, the $6.44 being

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:30.890
used to pay off your mortgage.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:35.940
The second month it's
more, $6.47.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:40.730
I couldn't show the whole page
here, but here after six years

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:45.900
six months your interest is down
to $1.74, because your

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:50.190
balance is down to $407.61.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:53.790
And so, your payment of
principal is much higher.

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:57.220
The reason this table is
important is that people move

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.930
and they sell their
house early.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:01.190
They don't hold it for
the full 10 years.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:04.560
So, you have to figure out when
someone sells his house

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.220
after six years six months,
what do they still owe?

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:14.400
Well, they now owe, instead of
$1,000, they owe $407.61.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.080
So, that's the idea of
a long-term mortgage.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.100
Your interest payments are
changing all the time, your

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.520
principal payments are changing
all the time, but

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.440
your total payment is fixed.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:34.290
That was an invention, a
financial innovation in 1934.

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:37.690
This is called a conventional
fixed rate mortgage, and it's

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:41.010
now offered in many countries
of the world.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:46.490
However, there's only two
countries where it's the major

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:47.960
kind of mortgage.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.370
United States and Denmark.

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:53.980
This is a strange thing.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:58.550
This invention has not caught
on around the world.

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:01.890
It's unique to only two
countries, although you can

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:04.970
get it in other countries.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.800
It's not available in Canada
in any number, I guess you

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:14.550
could find it, but it's
not common elsewhere.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:17.160
Every time I go to a foreign
country, I ask the people

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:22.525
there, why don't you have
fixed rate mortgages?

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.500
I don't necessarily
get good answers.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.410
I've been trying to understand
why it hasn't caught on.

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:37.380
Then I recently saw that
Alistair Darling, who was

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.630
under the Labour government --

00:44:45.642 --> 00:44:49.120
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.790
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Alistair Darling was

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:54.950
Chancellor of the Exchequer in
the United Kingdom until the

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.310
Conservative government
took over.

00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:02.255
He issued a statement saying
that U.K. should finally adopt

00:45:02.255 --> 00:45:03.505
the long-term mortgage.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:13.020
The problem is that any country,
that doesn't have a

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:16.620
long-term fixed rate mortgage,
runs the risk of falling into

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.210
the same problem that the United
States did in the Great

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:20.230
Depression.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.760
Some kind of crisis like that
could mean that people would

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.940
lose their homes in
great numbers.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:30.730
So, he said he'd like to see the
U.K. get people borrowing

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:35.150
at 10, 20, or even 25 years
for their mortgages.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:37.430
But instead what happened
was, the Conservative

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.440
government took over.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.920
But you can, in the U.K.,
get long-term mortgages.

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.900
I think it's true in most
countries of the world.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.940
They're just not common there.

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.480
It's a bit of a puzzle.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.660
Why is it that only two
countries do this generally?

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:58.320
I have a couple of reasons
to offer why it is.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.360
One of them is that the general
public is resistant to

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.640
long-term mortgages, because
they charge a higher interest.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:13.580
If the lender is going to
guarantee it for 30 years,

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:15.320
they're going to have to charge
you a higher rate,

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.180
because that guarantee costs
something to them.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:24.500
And consumers are resistant
to paying the higher rate.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.140
And that's part of
the problem.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.890
The other part of the problem is
that bank regulators might

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:32.920
not encourage banks to make
these loans, because it's

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.550
risky for banks.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:38.590
If banks tie their money up for
30 years, and then they

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:40.690
have depositors who can withdraw
their money at

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:44.310
anytime, the banks could go
under, if there was ever a run

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:44.780
on the banks.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:48.500
They can't liquidate these
mortgages fast at all.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.250
So, you need a coordinated
effort of a government to

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:57.720
first make sure the regulators
accept these concepts.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.270
And it puts some risk on the
public of the possible bailout

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:02.520
of the banking system.

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:11.120
And then, you have to get
past public resistance.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.070
You have to make the public
understand that, when you get

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:17.390
a fixed rate mortgage, it's
a clean contract.

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:21.080
We have no worries
for 30 years.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:24.780
As opposed to problems that
have sometimes occurred.

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:33.730
In Canada, in 1980, the interest
rates shot way up,

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:37.630
and we had a duplicate of the
problem that we saw in the

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:41.530
U.S. People couldn't afford to
refinance their mortgages, and

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:44.570
a lot of people lost
their homes.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:47.910
And so, it was a big problem.

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:51.020
But they somehow got through
that, and they're not really

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.290
thinking about fixed
rate mortgages in

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.265
Canada even now, today.

00:48:00.825 --> 00:48:05.950
I wanted to go on talking about
innovation in finance.

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:11.190
Another very important
innovation is securitization

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:18.410
of mortgages, and government
support of mortgage markets.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:25.765
In the United States, in 1938,
the federal government, this

00:48:25.765 --> 00:48:30.740
is also the Roosevelt
Administration, set up the

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:43.760
Federal National Mortgage
Administration, which was a

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:49.000
government agency that would buy
mortgages to support the

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.480
mortgage market.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:57.120
On Wall Street they couldn't
pronounce Federal National

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.570
Mortgage --

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:00.010
or is it Association?

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:06.575
I'm sorry, it's Association
not Administration.

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:12.480
You know what they called
it on Wall Sreet?

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.410
They called it Fannie Mae.

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:26.900
That was just an irreverent
short name for the

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.280
Association.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.530
It was run by the government.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:40.790
However, in the year 1968, the
U.S. government privatized

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:46.270
Fannie Mae, and it became
a private corporation.

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:50.830
So what did Fannie Mae do?

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.490
It would buy mortgages
from banks.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.890
They were trying to encourage
the mortgage market.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:59.720
So, a bank would lend money to
someone to buy a house, and

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:00.380
then they're done.

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.820
They can't loan any
more money unless

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:03.440
they raise more deposits.

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.260
Well, Fannie Mae would buy the
mortgage from them, and they'd

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.890
have money again
to lend again.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.900
They did this in '38, because
we were still in the

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:19.340
Depression, and the housing
market was still depressed.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:20.450
They weren't building homes.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:22.690
There were lots of unemployed
construction workers.

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:25.750
And so, Roosevelt was just
thinking how can we stimulate

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:26.970
the economy?

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:29.900
And this was one
of their ideas.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:34.990
So, Fannie Mae was the mortgage
finance giant that

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:36.895
was created in 1968 [correction:
created in 1938,

00:50:36.895 --> 00:50:39.960
privatized in 1968].

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:46.160
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:51.800
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: In
1970, the government created

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.125
another Fannie-Mae-like
institution.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:01.240
Its official name was Federal
Home Loan Mortgage

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.576
Corporation.

00:51:03.576 --> 00:51:06.890
Wall Street had to invent
a name for it.

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:12.760
So, they called it
Freddie Mac.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.180
They thought, well, we gave a
girl's name to Fannie Mae,

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:16.410
let's give a boy's name.

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:19.610
I guess that's a boy's name.

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:25.150
Both of these organizations
are private companies now,

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:30.100
created by the government, and
they both use these names

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:30.930
officially now.

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:32.560
So, that's their name now.

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.850
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.120
Freddie Mac was initially
different.

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:40.590
Because what the government
asked Freddie Mac to do, was

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:45.590
buy mortgages, and then
repackage them as mortgage

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:50.505
securities, and sell them off
with a Freddie Mac guarantee.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.720
So, once Freddie Mac started
doing this, Fannie Mae said,

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.080
well, can't we do that too?

00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.910
So, they both do it.

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:03.540
So, what the government had
done is create two private

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:04.870
corporations.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:10.320
You kind of wonder why did the
government even do that?

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.310
Anyone can create --

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:12.850
Remember we have a
corporate law.

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:15.020
I can start my own
Freddie Mac.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.610
My own Fannie Mae.

00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:19.870
But the government did create
them by privatizing Fannie Mae

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:23.880
and by creating Freddie Mac.

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.870
And they are both
in the mortgage

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:28.210
securitization business.

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:31.165
So, they would buy from mortgage
originators --

00:52:31.165 --> 00:52:32.880
the people who lend the money.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.800
They'd buy the mortgages.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.280
In other words, they would take
the IOU from someone.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:42.040
They'd repackage them into
securities, and sell them off

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:47.810
to the public with a guarantee
from Fannie or Freddie, that,

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:52.140
if there were a default, the
mortgage extra balance would

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:56.170
be made up by Fannie
or Freddie.

00:52:56.170 --> 00:53:00.860
Well, they did then get other
companies, called mortgage

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:04.540
insurers, to insure at least
part of the balance.

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.560
It's a complicated financial
agreement.

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:09.890
But what we had was private
companies created by the U.S.

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:13.700
government, that created
securities for investors that

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.970
were guaranteed against
default,

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:20.250
and based on mortgages.

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:30.530
So, the government then also
stated that these are private

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:33.770
companies and the U.S.
government does not stand

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:35.030
behind them.

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:37.700
People started to say the
government created these two

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:42.350
corporations, and now they're
securitizing and guaranteeing

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:45.860
trillions of dollars
of mortgages.

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:47.870
Is this going to come back
and end up being

00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:51.220
paid for by the taxpayer?

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:55.050
So, the government stated
clearly, these are now private

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:55.710
corporations.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:57.250
Fannie Mae started out
as part of the

00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:59.250
government, but no longer.

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:01.100
Now, it's a private
corporation.

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:04.265
And if Fannie Mae goes bankrupt,
woe be tied to

00:54:04.265 --> 00:54:07.040
anyone who bought their
securities, because their

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.670
guarantee is not backed up by
the federal government.

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:13.200
So people complained, though.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.320
They said, you're saying that
it's not backed up by the

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:20.600
federal government, but do
you really mean that?

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.700
If Fannie or Freddie goes
bankrupt, will the U.S.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:26.940
government just let
them go under?

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:29.430
Well, the official statement
was, yes, the government will

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:31.010
let them go under.

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:34.140
Guess what happened?

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:38.810
In 2008, the real estate market
crashed and we had our

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:42.410
first housing crisis that
was similar to the Great

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:43.670
Depression.

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:47.820
And in that housing crisis,
both Fannie and

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:50.700
Freddie went bankrupt.

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.330
And now, what do we do?

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:53.890
We're in the Bush
Administration.

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:54.800
Republican.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:58.090
They don't particularly
like bailouts.

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:01.880
So you think, of course, George
W. Bush would just --

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.100
it's the law, right?

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:06.050
The federal government's not
going to bail them out.

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:10.160
But then some people said, wait
a minute, you know all

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.980
over the world people are
investing in these, thinking

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:16.530
that Fannie Mae was created
by the U.S. government.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.370
In particular a lot of Chinese,
those poor innocent

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:23.790
Chinese, are trusting the
Americans, and they put many

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:26.870
billions of dollars
into Fannie Mae.

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:29.120
Are you going to go and
tell the Chinese?

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:32.010
Sorry, we won't back it.

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:34.920
Well, someone can say, sure,
go tell them that.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:37.270
It's what we've been
saying all along.

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:40.140
But then the Chinese could
come back and say, well,

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:42.050
you've been saying that, but
nobody believed you.

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:44.230
Everyone knew that that
wasn't right.

00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:47.970
And the federal government
didn't take all the right

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:50.020
steps to make it really clear.

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:54.420
For example, the Wall Street
Journal used to list Fannie

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.710
Mae bonds and Freddie Mac bonds
in a section of the

00:55:57.710 --> 00:56:02.740
newspaper entitled ''Government
Securities.'' And

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.940
that's the Wall Street
Journal.

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:05.680
That's not the government
talking.

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:09.080
But, the U.S. government should
have come in and told

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.200
them, no, those are
not government.

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:14.710
So, we poor, innocent, Chinese
investors, we've read your

00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:18.110
paper and it said Government
Securities.

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:21.060
Now George Bush could've
said, tough luck.

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:25.820
You guys should have read the
fine print, but he didn't.

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:26.420
Why not?

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:29.020
Because it jeopardizes
too much.

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:32.170
If the U.S. government lets
these agencies that it created

00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:35.810
go bankrupt, and it lets all
those people all over the

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:38.620
world down who invested
in those securities.

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:39.870
They're going to be mad.

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:43.786
We have a reputation.

00:56:43.786 --> 00:56:47.700
The United States is able to
raise so much money from all

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:51.880
over the world, because they
think that it's safe here, and

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.500
if we just let these fail it's
not going to look right.

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:57.840
So, the U.S. government
took them both under

00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.890
conservatorship, and is
paying their debts, so

00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:03.620
those do not default.

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:07.560
What we've learned from this
lesson is that you can say a

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:10.730
million times that you're not
going to guarantee something,

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:14.150
but eventually you end
up guaranteeing it.

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:19.380
I wanted to say something
about other

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:20.890
countries a little bit.

00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:26.580
Canada has something like Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac

00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:29.520
called the Canada Housing and
Mortgage Corporation.

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:37.420
And so, I'll just talk about
other countries.

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:45.060
The Canada Housing and
Mortgage Corporation.

00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:59.360
It was created by the government
of Canada, and it

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.780
does work that resembles
the FHA and that

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.530
resembles Fannie Mae.

00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:07.280
But it's owned by the
Canadian government.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:10.060
It's not privatized.

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:14.410
And so, you might say, well,
it's the same in Canada.

00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:17.420
But the big difference
is, it's smaller.

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:19.960
They didn't let it get as big
as Fannie and Freddie.

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:24.480
So, it isn't heard
as much from.

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:29.325
I was a keynote speaker at a
conference on February 3

00:58:29.325 --> 00:58:30.360
[addition: 2011],

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.760
that the Financial Times
organized in New York called

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:36.030
Focus on Canada.

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:40.230
And I had to give a talk about
Canada to New York investors.

00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:43.250
They told me there were hardly
any Canadians in the audience.

00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:46.240
What are we doing here in New
York talking about Canada?

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.670
Well, it's because
the Americans

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:49.600
invest heavily in Canada.

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:53.280
So, I was up talking to all
these American people, and I

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.700
was looking at Canada, and the
Canada banking system.

00:58:56.700 --> 00:59:02.690
And I said to the group, Canada
and America are just so

00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:04.540
similar I can't see much
of a difference.

00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:10.900
Canada didn't have Fannie
and Freddie.

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:13.920
It didn't have these housing
problems. But the worldwide

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.990
recession hit Canada
pretty hard.

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:20.290
And so I said, Canada and
U.S. are kind of like

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:23.550
two peas in a pod.

00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:25.410
They are so similar.

00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:28.160
People like to make much of
differences, but the Canadian

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:31.950
economy just moves up and
down in lockstep.

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:36.200
And I also said, Canada was
saved by the oil crisis, being

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.500
an oil exporter.

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:42.210
In 2008, remember when the
oil prices shot up?

00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:45.145
But little to my knowledge,
there was a reporter for the

00:59:45.145 --> 00:59:47.730
Financial Post in Canada
in the audience.

00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:55.070
And my talk got reported in the
Financial Post. And then I

00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:57.100
went on their website
and there was

00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:59.960
angry blogs from Canadians.

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.300
I don't think it's so insulting
to Canada to say

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.600
that we're just basically
similar.

01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:14.920
And I have say this for Canada,
they did not get so

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.520
gung-ho on supporting mortgages
as the United States

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.030
did, so they didn't have such
a big housing bubble

01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:24.400
that the U.S. did.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.110
Part of the reason the U.S. had
a housing bubble as big as

01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:31.750
it did is that these guys really
weren't independent.

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:33.530
They were taking orders
from the government.

01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:36.920
The government was telling them
to increase their lending

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:41.250
to low-income, underserved
communities.

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:42.730
They were promoting
the bubble.

01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:46.900
And so, Fannie and Freddie were
told to promote lending

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.940
to houses during the real estate
bubble that preceded

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.250
the crisis.

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:54.230
That didn't happen, at least
not so much, in Canada.

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:57.380
So, they've had less
of a bubble.

01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:02.135
But still the two countries are
basically very similar.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.140
The textbook talks a lot about
mortgage securities.

01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:17.560
I expect you to read this
out of Fabozzi et al.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.900
I actually got complaints
in past years.

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:25.470
Students found this the least
enjoyable part of the readings

01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:27.195
for this course.

01:01:27.195 --> 01:01:30.790
But you should know about
these things.

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:34.530
We have securities called
Collateralized Mortgage

01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:36.740
Obligations.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:42.270
These are mortgage
securities that

01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:44.850
are sold off to investors.

01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:50.302
And they hold mortgages, but, as
is explained in Fabozzi et

01:01:50.302 --> 01:01:55.720
al., they will divide them into
separate tranches, or

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:02.020
separate securities, in terms
of prepayment risk.

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:04.530
That is that there's a risk
that the mortgages will be

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:07.810
paid off early in times
when it's adverse to

01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:09.510
the investor interests.

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:13.210
So, they would divide up the
risks into different classes

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:14.370
of securities.

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:18.340
And some of them were rated AAA
by the rating agencies,

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.510
because they thought there was
almost no risk to those

01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:22.440
securities.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.830
And others were rated
differently.

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:33.770
And these CMOs were sold to
investors all over the world.

01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:36.810
Another kind of security,
which the textbook talks

01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:41.910
about, is a CDO, which is
a Collateralized Debt

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:43.110
Obligation.

01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:47.000
These are issued to investors,
and they typically hold

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.360
mortgage securities
as their assets.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.800
Many of them held subprime
mortgages in recent years,

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.750
mortgages that were issued
against subprime borrowers.

01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:05.290
A lot of these securities that
were rated very highly by the

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:10.960
rating agencies, rated AAA,
ended up defaulting and losing

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.780
money for their investors.

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:14.975
And the investors were
all over the world.

01:03:14.975 --> 01:03:19.540
The United States is a leader
in mortgage finance.

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:26.260
And companies in the United
States, not just Fannie and

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.760
Freddie, but lots of companies
were issuing mortgage

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.840
securities that had AAA ratings,
which meant that

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.240
Moody's and Standard and Poor's
and the other rating

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.350
agencies were telling
you basically

01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:40.320
there's no risk to them.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:45.000
And so, people in Europe, in
Asia, were investing in these,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.750
and they thought they were
perfectly safe, and then they

01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:49.000
went under.

01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:54.120
Part of it was bad
faith dealings

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.470
by some of the issuers.

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:59.900
Some of the issuers themselves
doubted that these mortgages

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.800
were so safe.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.090
But what do I care?

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.320
This is what happened.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:11.490
It's gotten to be a complicated
set of steps.

01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:13.730
Somebody originates
the mortgage.

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:15.680
That means I talk to
the homeowner.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.110
I have the homeowner fill
out the papers.

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:21.810
Then, after they've originated
the mortgage, they sell it to

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:26.090
an investor, like Fannie or
Freddie or some private

01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:29.220
mortgage securitizer.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:32.460
And the private mortgage
securitizer finds a mortgage

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:35.890
servicer, it may be the
originator, who will then

01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:37.250
service the mortgage.

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:39.530
What does it mean to service
the mortgage?

01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:41.640
It means to call you on the
phone if you've missed your

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.360
payment, for example.

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.720
Or if you have questions about
the mortgage, there should be

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.110
someone you call.

01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:49.120
So, the mortgage servicer
does that.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.670
That's a separate entity.

01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:55.430
And then we have the CMO
originator, then we have the

01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:57.150
CDO originator.

01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:00.190
It's gotten to be a very
complicated financial system.

01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:03.320
And then the whole
thing collapsed.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.950
So, there's been a lot of reform
to try to see, what can

01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:10.510
we do to prevent this
kind of collapse?

01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:12.840
Some people would say, let's
end the whole thing.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.610
Let's go back to 1778.

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:17.400
Let's not have mortgage
securitizers.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:21.150
But that's not the steps
that have been taken.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:24.230
I think that we are
making progress.

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:27.920
But I want to just conclude with
just a little reference

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.850
to one important change that
was made in both Europe and

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:35.460
the United States.

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:44.930
The European Parliament passed a
new directive that requires,

01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:52.040
or incentivizes, mortgage
originators to keep 5% of the

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.750
mortgage balance in their
own portfolio.

01:05:54.750 --> 01:06:01.060
That means, if you originate
mortgages, you can sell off

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.390
95% of the mortgages to
investors, but you

01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:06.990
have to keep 5%.

01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:11.400
So, this 5% limit was then later
incorporated into the

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.830
Dodd-Frank Act in the
United States.

01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:17.980
So, we again have the
same requirement.

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:23.350
And this is supposed to reduce
the moral hazard problem that

01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:26.760
created the crisis, and
retain the mortgage

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.680
securitization process.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.320
So, the idea is this --

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.330
And I know, I heard
people tell me.

01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:39.290
Mortgage originators sometimes
got cynical.

01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:41.260
They thought, OK,
I'm helping this

01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:43.690
family fill out a mortgage.

01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:45.790
What do I care?

01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:48.010
This family doesn't look
like they're not

01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:49.260
going to pay this back.

01:06:52.056 --> 01:06:53.350
But what do I care?

01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:54.460
I'll fill it out.

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.970
I'll sell the mortgage
to someone else,

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.260
and I'm out of here.

01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:00.166
In fact, it got bad in
some cases, with

01:07:00.166 --> 01:07:02.055
some mortgage brokers.

01:07:02.055 --> 01:07:06.400
A family would come wanting to
buy a house, and the mortgage

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.940
broker would say, what is
your income anyway?

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:13.240
And they would tell
him the income.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.140
And he'd say, you're trying
to buy a $300,000

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.920
house on that income?

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.390
I don't know if I can do this.

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:22.410
But then he'd say.

01:07:22.410 --> 01:07:22.970
Wait a minute.

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:23.790
Think about this again.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:25.900
Is that really your income?

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:28.960
You told me your income
is $40,000 a year.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.960
Are you sure?

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.270
Why don't we say $50,000
thousand a year.

01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:35.109
Or say $60,000 a year.

01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:39.069
And the couple would look at him
in disbelief and say, no,

01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:40.950
we only have $40,000.

01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:42.359
He would say, well,
think about it.

01:07:42.359 --> 01:07:46.340
You have other sources,
don't you?

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:48.490
Everybody does this, you know.

01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:50.649
So, OK, we have $60,000.

01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:51.899
He says fine.

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.300
And they thought, well, the
mortgage broker gave me

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.670
permission to do this.

01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:00.430
And he doesn't care,
because he's not

01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:02.840
going to take the loss.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.800
So, the new law is supposed to
discourage that kind of thing.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.189
And there's lots of new laws
that are trying to tighten up.

01:08:08.189 --> 01:08:10.960
For example, mortgage brokers in
the United States now have

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.090
to be licensed.

01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:15.029
It used to be just five years
ago, you could be an ex-con,

01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:17.939
fresh out of jail, and you could
take up a business as

01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:19.300
mortgage broker.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.740
You can't anymore.

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.870
So, what's happening all over
the world is that we've

01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:26.399
learned from this experience,
but we're retaining this basic

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:29.250
system of mortgage
securitization.

01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:31.689
Mortgage lenders that
are professional.

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:34.430
The basic industry has
been retained.

01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:36.800
And we're hoping and thinking
that maybe we

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:38.750
have a better system.

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:43.210
So I will stop there, and
I'll see you on Monday.

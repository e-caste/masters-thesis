00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.233
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: So,

00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:05.180
so far here is what we have
done.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.612
We've been studying the whole
time this analogue of Newton's

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:17.316
law: τ = Iα.
So, after teaching you what

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:21.130
τ is and what I
is and what α is,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.002
in the early days I
concentrated on problems where

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:27.757
τ is not zero.
There is some object on which

00:00:27.757 --> 00:00:32.370
some torques are acting and in
responds to the torques--in

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.660
response to the torques,
the body will accelerate.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.319
Then, we went to another class
of problems where there were no

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:44.679
external torques,
there are only torques from

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.085
inside.
Excuse me, will you people who

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:50.098
come late use the other door?
Yeah, you're blocking actually

00:00:50.098 --> 00:00:52.160
the taping right now.
Yes.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.276
All right.
So, today, I'm going to

00:00:57.276 --> 00:01:04.530
consider an extreme case where
there is no torque at all.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.694
If there's no torque,
we know α is zero and

00:01:07.694 --> 00:01:09.909
the angular velocity is
constant.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.880
But I'm going to take a case
where even angular velocity is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.530
zero.
There is no motion;

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.525
there is no torque.
So you can say,

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:19.010
"You know, what's there to
study?"

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.841
Well, sometimes it's of great
interest to us that the object

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:26.054
has no angular velocity.
A common example is,

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:29.408
you are trying to do something
in your house,

00:01:29.408 --> 00:01:33.220
you get up on a ladder,
that's somewhere there.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.630
This ladder should have no
angular velocity.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.541
Right?
That's not a trivial statement

00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:41.970
to a person who is going up
there.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.279
So you want to ask,
"What does it take to keep the

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:50.819
ladder from falling over?"
Okay, that's what we're going

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.780
to discuss.
All right.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.754
So, let me start with a simple
problem and take some horizontal

00:01:57.754 --> 00:02:00.963
rod like this.
And I say, "What does it take

00:02:00.963 --> 00:02:03.750
to keep the rod from moving
around?"

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.227
And the first thing,
you know, is the forces on it

00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:09.160
should add up to zero because
otherwise F = ma tells

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.789
you this rod's going to be
flying off somewhere.

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:13.977
So, I've taken a body,
a rod of length L,

00:02:13.977 --> 00:02:15.699
and I don't want it to move at
all.

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:20.320
So, total forces adding up to
zero we know is not good enough

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.710
because here is the problem
where I apply two forces equal

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.466
and opposite,
add up to zero,

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:31.970
but that doesn't do it.
This rod will still rotate.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.129
It is still true that when the
total forces add up to zero,

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.069
the center of mass will not
accelerate.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.617
But that doesn't mean the body
will not move because keeping

00:02:41.617 --> 00:02:43.690
the center of mass fixed,
the body can rotate.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.143
All right.
So, you have to ask yourself,

00:02:49.143 --> 00:02:51.830
"What does it take to keep it
from rotating?"

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.080
Then we know that the cause of
rotation is the torque.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.198
So, I'm going to write down now
the conditions for a body,

00:02:59.198 --> 00:03:02.810
a planar body lying in the
plane of the blackboard,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.285
to stay still and not move.
They are that all the forces in

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:11.985
the x direction.
i is some label,

00:03:11.985 --> 00:03:13.650
force number 1,
force number 2.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.777
That should add up to zero.
All the forces in the y

00:03:16.777 --> 00:03:19.400
direction;
that should add up to zero.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.221
This will make sure the center
of mass as a whole is not going

00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:23.633
anywhere.
And finally,

00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:28.375
to keep the body from moving or
spinning, all the torques should

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.490
add up to zero.
So, bulk of the lecture today

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.039
will just be dealing with this
condition.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:38.839
So, what we're going to study
today is a collection of objects

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:43.481
that are somehow subject to a
variety of forces but still in

00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:46.040
equilibrium,
in static equilibrium.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.101
That means they are not moving.
So, simplest problem from the

00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:55.665
family is a seesaw.
Let's say that's a point where

00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:59.856
the seesaw is supported and
let's say we put one kid here

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:03.150
applying some force
F_1.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.849
So F_1 is the
mg for the kid.

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.531
And let's say this end is a
distance x_1

00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:13.683
from the support.
The question is,

00:04:13.683 --> 00:04:17.240
"How much of a kid should I put
here to keep this in balance?"

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.174
It should not move under the
combined weight of these two

00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:28.069
kids.
So, I take the body and I write

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:33.269
down all the forces on it.
So, I have F_1

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:37.912
coming down here.
I have F_2

00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:40.278
there.
Then there is--Of course,

00:04:40.278 --> 00:04:43.909
that cannot be the whole story
because the seesaw is not going

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:47.176
into the ground.
That is the support and the

00:04:47.176 --> 00:04:51.803
normal force from the support.
And these three forces together

00:04:51.803 --> 00:04:55.240
should conspire to keep the body
in equilibrium.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.257
So let's see.
So, here is what I want you to

00:04:58.257 --> 00:05:00.579
understand.
F_1 is known.

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:03.120
Let's give it some name,
100 Newtons.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.567
This distance
x_1 is also

00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:07.767
known.
That distance

00:05:07.767 --> 00:05:09.230
x_2 is also
known.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.098
I'm trying to find out what
force F_2 is

00:05:12.098 --> 00:05:14.615
needed.
So, F_2 is

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:18.558
what I'm trying to solve for.
So, I write all the equations I

00:05:18.558 --> 00:05:19.639
know.
So, horizontally,

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.290
there's nothing going on.
So, it's zero equals zero.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.743
In the vertical direction,
I have F_1

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:30.189
pushing down,
F_2 pushing

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:34.125
down equals N.
And that's not going to be

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:38.220
enough to solve this problem
because I have two unknowns.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.310
I don't know N and I
don't know F_2.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.536
I just know this guy.
So, that's where the torque

00:05:44.536 --> 00:05:49.411
equation's going to come in.
Now, here is the subtlety when

00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:52.120
you do the torque in this
problem.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.620
So, how do you find the torque
due to any force?

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.150
Can you tell me what you're
supposed to do?

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.430
Yeah?
Yes, you, yes.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.934
Student:
[inaudible]

00:06:04.934 --> 00:06:07.480
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.199
What r should I use for
this force?

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:11.770
Student:
[inaudible]

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.670
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pardon me?

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.120
x_1?
Okay, why did you choose that?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.154
Student:
[inaudible]

00:06:22.154 --> 00:06:25.519
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay.

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:27.791
Her answer was,
"That's the pivot so I chose

00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:29.693
that distance."
The point is,

00:06:29.693 --> 00:06:34.250
when we say the body has no net
torque, which means it's not

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.204
rotating around some axis.
If there is an axis around

00:06:38.204 --> 00:06:41.698
which a body is rotating,
then we know how to take the

00:06:41.698 --> 00:06:45.528
torques through that axis.
When a body is not rotating,

00:06:45.528 --> 00:06:48.680
it's not rotating around any
axis whatsoever.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.252
So, you can say it's not
rotating through an axis I draw

00:06:53.252 --> 00:06:55.813
through here.
So, I will take all the torque

00:06:55.813 --> 00:06:57.863
with respect to that point.
Someone else can say,

00:06:57.863 --> 00:06:59.589
"No, it's not rotating through
that either.

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:02.589
I will take all torques from
that point."

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.590
If you change your mind on
where you're taking the torque,

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.380
then the torques are all
changing because in the force

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.170
times distance the distances are
going to change.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.147
So, now we have a predicament
where for every possible point

00:07:15.147 --> 00:07:18.920
around which I compute a torque,
I will get a condition

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.754
involving the different forces
and the distances from that

00:07:22.754 --> 00:07:24.840
point.
So, I can write down an

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.830
infinite number of equations for
each different choice of pivot

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.172
point.
But I only have two unknowns,

00:07:31.172 --> 00:07:33.300
F_2 and
N.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.017
Two unknowns can only satisfy
two equations,

00:07:37.017 --> 00:07:40.868
not 2,000 equations.
So, we've got to hope that the

00:07:40.868 --> 00:07:45.025
extra equations I get by varying
the pivot point all say the same

00:07:45.025 --> 00:07:47.120
thing.
And that's what I will show you.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.226
I will show you,
first, that if you have a bunch

00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:56.382
of forces that add up to zero,
then it doesn't matter around

00:07:56.382 --> 00:07:59.790
which point you compute the
torque.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.504
If it was zero around one
point, then it will be zero

00:08:03.504 --> 00:08:07.668
around any other point.
Suppose I pick some point here

00:08:07.668 --> 00:08:11.711
and I take each force,
multiply the distance of that

00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:16.230
force from that pivot point and
they added up to zero.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.336
Now you come along and say,
"No, I want to take the torque

00:08:20.336 --> 00:08:23.666
around that point."
What you will be computing will

00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:25.424
be the same force,
but to every

00:08:25.424 --> 00:08:28.822
x_i you will
add a distance a where

00:08:28.822 --> 00:08:32.280
a is the distance by
which you moved your axis.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.805
Now, let's open this out.
You'll find it is

00:08:37.805 --> 00:08:41.847
F_ix_i +
a times sum of all the

00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:43.620
F_is.

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:52.574
This is zero because for me the
torque around that point

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:56.880
vanished and this is zero
because all the forces add up to

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.434
zero.
In other words,

00:08:58.434 --> 00:09:01.756
if you find any one point and
make sure the torques around

00:09:01.756 --> 00:09:05.019
that point don't cause--that
they all add up to zero,

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:08.892
then the torque around any
other point will also add up to

00:09:08.892 --> 00:09:12.629
zero, provided the sum of the
forces adds up to zero.

00:09:12.629 --> 00:09:14.373
And of course,
that's the problem we're

00:09:14.373 --> 00:09:16.884
looking at.
So, you've got to realize that

00:09:16.884 --> 00:09:20.139
when you take the torque,
you may pick any point you

00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:23.195
like.
Now, that's where a strategic

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:26.789
issue comes up.
If you were asked simply to

00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:31.737
find what F_2
is, not to completely solve the

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:33.782
problem,
which would be also finding

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:35.533
what the normal force is--if
someone said,

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:37.070
"Just find
F_2,"

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.153
I don't care what N is"
then, there's a particular

00:09:41.153 --> 00:09:44.070
choice of pivot point that is
optimal.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.494
That choice is the one in which
this normal force doesn't get to

00:09:48.494 --> 00:09:53.059
enter the torque equation and I
think you all know what I mean.

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:55.970
Pick that point as the point
around which you take the

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.539
torques;
then N drops out.

00:09:58.539 --> 00:10:03.029
So, this is the usual model
when you take torques.

00:10:03.029 --> 00:10:07.388
Always take the torque through
a point where an unknown force

00:10:07.388 --> 00:10:11.747
is acting because the unknown
force doesn't contribute to the

00:10:11.747 --> 00:10:14.019
torque equation.
So in principle,

00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:17.041
you can take the torque around
any point and you can satisfy

00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:20.161
yourself in your spare time;
it doesn't matter which point

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.170
you take.
It will be the more complicated

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.989
way to solve the problem because
N will come into the

00:10:24.989 --> 00:10:27.330
picture and no one asked you
what N is.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.845
So, we take the point of
support and then,

00:10:30.845 --> 00:10:34.360
of course here is the point of
support,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.656
and what did I have,
F_1 here a

00:10:36.656 --> 00:10:39.934
distance x_1,
I had F_2 at a

00:10:39.934 --> 00:10:42.998
distance x_2.
This is the point around which

00:10:42.998 --> 00:10:45.200
I'm doing the torque,
so N doesn't count.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.359
Then, you get a condition
F_1x_1 =

00:10:49.359 --> 00:10:53.115
F_2x_2.
From that you can solve for

00:10:53.115 --> 00:10:55.092
F_2.
For example,

00:10:55.092 --> 00:10:58.513
if this was one meter and this
was six meters,

00:10:58.513 --> 00:11:01.250
and this was say 10 Newtons
here,

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:06.110
then 10 times one has to be six
times F_2.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:12.269
So, 10 = 6F_2
and F_2 will be

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:16.054
10/6 Newtons.
I don't want to use N

00:11:16.054 --> 00:11:20.480
because N is also
standing for the force here.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.649
That's how we find
F_2.

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:24.786
Once you've found
F_2,

00:11:24.786 --> 00:11:28.215
in case you want to know what
is the support going through and

00:11:28.215 --> 00:11:32.007
how much load is it carrying,
you can come back now and add

00:11:32.007 --> 00:11:35.080
F_1,
which was given to you,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.159
and the F_2
you just solved for.

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:40.090
Then if you want to,
you can find N.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.183
Even if you were asked to find
N, it's best to first

00:11:44.183 --> 00:11:47.994
take torque around a point
N so N doesn't

00:11:47.994 --> 00:11:49.547
enter,
find F_2,

00:11:49.547 --> 00:11:51.275
then it's very trivial to add
F_1 and

00:11:51.275 --> 00:11:52.580
F_2 to get
N.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.886
This is the easiest prototype.
So, you guys have to know how

00:11:55.886 --> 00:11:58.107
this is done.
Everything I do will be more

00:11:58.107 --> 00:12:01.511
and more bells and whistles on
the simple notion of how to take

00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:04.549
the torque.
All right.

00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:07.418
So now, I'm going to take a
slightly more complicated

00:12:07.418 --> 00:12:11.616
problem.
So, here is a wall and there is

00:12:11.616 --> 00:12:17.379
a rod here of length L
and mass M.

00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:21.360
And it's supported by some kind
of pivot on the wall.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.403
And I want to hold it up by
supporting it here with a force

00:12:26.403 --> 00:12:30.225
F.
And the question is,

00:12:30.225 --> 00:12:35.250
"What force should I apply?"
Okay.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:41.726
So, we know that if I draw the
free body diagram of the rod,

00:12:41.726 --> 00:12:46.699
I have my force F;
I have gravity acting down

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:49.558
everywhere on the rod,
then the pivot,

00:12:49.558 --> 00:12:53.190
namely the wall,
it can exert a certain vertical

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.934
force.
It can also exert a horizontal

00:12:56.934 --> 00:12:58.885
force.
No one tells you the wall is

00:12:58.885 --> 00:13:01.389
frictionless or anything or the
pivot is frictionless.

00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:04.217
So, the wall is exerting in
general a force,

00:13:04.217 --> 00:13:07.570
which is at some oblique angle,
which I've broken up

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.990
conveniently into horizontal and
vertical parts.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:16.759
What about gravity?
And torque due to gravity is

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:21.163
what I want to discuss now.
First of all,

00:13:21.163 --> 00:13:24.968
I am only asking you to find
the force I have to apply to

00:13:24.968 --> 00:13:27.348
support the rod.
So, just like the other

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:30.139
problem, I'm not asking you to
find v and h.

00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:34.193
So the trick,
once more, is to jump straight

00:13:34.193 --> 00:13:37.990
to the torque equation.
Forget about the force equation.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.083
Go to the torque equation and
take the torque around this

00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:44.266
point, then this guy is out.
No matter what's going on --

00:13:44.266 --> 00:13:47.210
doesn't matter -- the torque due
to the pivot is out.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:51.171
So, we have to equate the
torque due to the force I apply

00:13:51.171 --> 00:13:54.850
to the torque due to gravity
pulling the rod down.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.153
Torque due to force I apply;
that torque,

00:13:58.153 --> 00:14:01.882
is equal to F times the
length of the rod because

00:14:01.882 --> 00:14:05.882
there's F times r times
the sine of the angle between

00:14:05.882 --> 00:14:08.247
them,
and the sine of the angle is 9,

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:09.879
the sine of 90,
which is one.

00:14:09.879 --> 00:14:13.669
How about the torque due to the
pull of gravity?

00:14:13.669 --> 00:14:15.760
Anybody know what we're
supposed to do here?

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.247
Yeah?
Student:

00:14:19.247 --> 00:14:22.255
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:14:22.255 --> 00:14:24.990
Shankar: Okay.
Now, why is that?

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:30.070
Why is it okay to replace the
torque by the center of mass?

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:33.580
Yeah?
Either of you can answer, yes.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.871
Student:
[inaudible]

00:14:35.871 --> 00:14:39.750
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:44.007
But why am I allowed to pretend?
See, we can pretend a lot but

00:14:44.007 --> 00:14:47.986
it occasionally has to
correspond to reality so that it

00:14:47.986 --> 00:14:50.170
works.
So, why is it okay to pretend?

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.292
That's a correct answer.
Student:

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:54.606
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:14:54.606 --> 00:14:57.554
Shankar: Right.
But if I really wanted to prove

00:14:57.554 --> 00:15:00.407
it, somebody has a way to really
nail it down and show that it's

00:15:00.407 --> 00:15:01.549
okay?
Yes?

00:15:01.549 --> 00:15:03.355
Student:
[inaudible]

00:15:03.355 --> 00:15:06.690
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Thank you.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.530
Yes.
Your answer is right.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.559
I know where you're going.
That's the right answer.

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:15.537
Look, what you want to do is
you always have to go back to

00:15:15.537 --> 00:15:17.908
first principles.
You cannot take anything on

00:15:17.908 --> 00:15:20.664
faith because you picked it up
on the street or someone

00:15:20.664 --> 00:15:23.259
whispered this to you.
That's not good enough.

00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:27.690
One lesson I want to show you
throughout the lectures is,

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.250
I cannot invoke new laws or new
principles.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.950
The only principle we know is
F = ma.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.389
You've got to go back to that
all the time.

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:39.006
Of course, there is the other
principle that gravity is an

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:41.834
extra force on the body.
But this is an external--This

00:15:41.834 --> 00:15:44.778
is an extended object.
It's got a center of mass but

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.110
gravity is not necessarily
acting there.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.500
It's pulling each part of it
down.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.026
So, I want to show you that in
the end of course the answer is

00:15:52.026 --> 00:15:54.801
as if all the mass were
concentrated here for the

00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:57.750
purposes of torques but I want
to show you why.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.797
So, the trick proposed by this
gentleman here--Imagine dividing

00:16:01.797 --> 00:16:04.812
the rod into tiny pieces,
each of which is small enough

00:16:04.812 --> 00:16:07.230
to say it has a definite
location x_i.

00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:13.281
The torque, due to gravity
acting on that little

00:16:13.281 --> 00:16:16.049
fellow--It's the mass of that
little guy times

00:16:16.049 --> 00:16:18.509
x_i times
g.

00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:20.294
If mg is the force,
then mg times

00:16:20.294 --> 00:16:21.730
x_i is the
torque.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.549
You want to sum it over all the
little pieces.

00:16:24.549 --> 00:16:27.179
Sum over i is summing
over all the little pieces.

00:16:27.179 --> 00:16:31.259
So, let me make my life easy by
dividing by the total mass and

00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:34.748
multiplying by the total mass.
If I started this combination

00:16:34.748 --> 00:16:36.840
m_ix
_i summed over

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.629
I divided by M,
that is the center of mass.

00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:43.770
So, it does look like
Mgx, where x is

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:48.792
the center of mass of the rod.
Now, the rod really doesn't

00:16:48.792 --> 00:16:52.220
have to be uniform for me to say
this.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.710
It doesn't have to be a uniform
rod.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.320
The mass can be distributed any
way it likes.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.289
Each m_i need
not be the same.

00:16:57.289 --> 00:17:00.730
But it's very important that
gravity be constant.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.544
We demand that the force of
gravity have a constant value

00:17:04.544 --> 00:17:07.971
over the length of the rod.
And it's not obvious that's

00:17:07.971 --> 00:17:10.446
always true.
I mean, if I took a tiny rod,

00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:13.569
force of gravity is
constant--took a very big rod,

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:16.060
comparable to the size of the
Earth, of course the pull of

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.069
gravity is varying on the length
of the rod.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:21.360
But for all rods on the
laboratory scale,

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.221
that's not an issue.
And that's where this result

00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:27.259
comes from.
Okay.

00:17:27.259 --> 00:17:29.527
So, now that we know where the
result comes from,

00:17:29.527 --> 00:17:31.700
we will now apply it in the
torque equation.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.589
This is the torque due to the
force I apply Fx.

00:17:35.589 --> 00:17:39.962
That's equal to Mg times
x, where x is the

00:17:39.962 --> 00:17:43.987
location of the center of mass.
That is going to be half the

00:17:43.987 --> 00:17:48.155
length of the rod.
I'm sorry-- this Fx is

00:17:48.155 --> 00:17:51.771
FL.
We cancel the L,

00:17:51.771 --> 00:17:57.145
then you find the force
I apply is Mg

00:17:57.145 --> 00:18:00.000
divided by two.
Yeah?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.386
Student:
[inaudible]

00:18:02.386 --> 00:18:06.976
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: If the pivot is

00:18:06.976 --> 00:18:09.671
exerting what force?
Student:

00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:10.752
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:18:10.752 --> 00:18:16.390
Shankar: Yeah.
But it won't cause a torque.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:19.095
Student:
[inaudible]

00:18:19.095 --> 00:18:24.819
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: I am finding--no.

00:18:24.819 --> 00:18:27.309
Here, what I'm calculating is
not the net force.

00:18:27.309 --> 00:18:31.168
I'm finding the torque around
this point due to the pull of

00:18:31.168 --> 00:18:34.960
gravity on the different
segments that make up the rod.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.804
Student:
[inaudible]

00:18:37.804 --> 00:18:42.289
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh.

00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:46.538
But the pull of gravity is
straight down and the separation

00:18:46.538 --> 00:18:51.160
is horizontal.
Is that the question now?

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.796
Student:
I want to know about the force

00:18:52.796 --> 00:18:54.069
you're applying,
not the gravity.

00:18:54.069 --> 00:18:55.035
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Well,

00:18:55.035 --> 00:18:55.880
I'm--oh, the force I am
applying.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.799
Oh, I am applying the force
here, straight up.

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:01.505
Oh, you want to know--
Student:

00:19:01.505 --> 00:19:03.917
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:19:03.917 --> 00:19:09.480
Shankar: Ah.
Well, you're quite right.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.934
You're saying we don't know
a priori whether the

00:19:11.934 --> 00:19:14.070
force I'm applying is vertical
or horizontal.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.390
Correct?
Maybe that's your question.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.440
That's actually a valid
question.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.601
It's clear that I have to apply
vertical force and possibly

00:19:22.601 --> 00:19:26.059
horizontal force to compensate.
This one, if there is a

00:19:26.059 --> 00:19:28.360
horizontal force in the wall.
You're quite right.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.020
Absolutely correct.
So, this F--I should

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.173
also divide the force that I
apply into a vertical part I

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:37.890
call F and a horizontal
part that I call H prime.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:43.135
Then, it'll turn that in this
problem an H prime is not

00:19:43.135 --> 00:19:44.857
needed.
You can sort of tell

00:19:44.857 --> 00:19:47.319
intuitively if you're holding up
a plank, you know.

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.430
One end is anchored and you're
trying to support it;

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.269
it's enough to apply a vertical
force.

00:19:51.269 --> 00:19:53.559
But I don't have to presume
that.

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.432
So, if you want,
you can think of applying

00:19:55.432 --> 00:19:58.076
horizontal force.
But it's not necessary to hold

00:19:58.076 --> 00:20:00.836
this in equilibrium.
Maybe the main point is,

00:20:00.836 --> 00:20:04.057
a purely vertical force will
suffice to keep this in

00:20:04.057 --> 00:20:06.900
equilibrium, is the point that
I'm making.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.537
In fact, if that force is equal
to Mg/2,

00:20:09.537 --> 00:20:13.203
it won't rotate.
Now, we can go back--now that I

00:20:13.203 --> 00:20:17.281
find the force I have to apply
in this direction,

00:20:17.281 --> 00:20:21.409
what force is at the pivot?
Well, the vertical force on the

00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:24.905
pivot is pointing up.
My force that I calculated is

00:20:24.905 --> 00:20:28.553
pointing up.
And together they should add up

00:20:28.553 --> 00:20:33.435
to Mg.
Now, F = Mg/2 so the

00:20:33.435 --> 00:20:38.390
vertical force will be
Mg/2.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.001
Now, horizontal force--In this
problem, there is no need for

00:20:42.001 --> 00:20:45.429
you to apply the horizontal
force and there's no need for

00:20:45.429 --> 00:20:48.980
the pivot to fight you back with
the horizontal force.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.615
It's not needed for
equilibrium, but supposed you

00:20:51.615 --> 00:20:53.445
insisted.
Not only are we lifting it but

00:20:53.445 --> 00:20:55.984
we are leaning into the rod.
Yes, then, you will apply

00:20:55.984 --> 00:20:58.460
horizontal force.
It's not going to contribute to

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.492
the torque equation,
but if you push it in,

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:03.057
wall's got to push you out,
and H prime will be

00:21:03.057 --> 00:21:06.313
equal to H.
In fact, let's turn to a

00:21:06.313 --> 00:21:11.135
problem where the support,
in fact, exerts a horizontal

00:21:11.135 --> 00:21:15.031
and vertical force.
So, that's the next level of

00:21:15.031 --> 00:21:17.801
difficulty.
This is one of the standard

00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:21.180
problems in the section and it
goes like this.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.150
Here is a rod and it's
supported by a wire.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:32.780
And the wire has a certain
tension T.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.189
It is anchored to the wall;
the length of the rod is

00:21:35.189 --> 00:21:37.410
L, the mass of the rod is
M.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:41.642
And at the--This end is some
pivot, which is exerting some

00:21:41.642 --> 00:21:44.983
unknown force,
which can have a horizontal and

00:21:44.983 --> 00:21:48.091
vertical part.
We'll have a horizontal part

00:21:48.091 --> 00:21:50.559
H and a vertical part
V.

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:52.960
Now, I know for sure there's a
horizontal part.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.460
I think you can tell--can you
guys tell in your mind where

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.941
there's a horizontal part?
This force that's supporting it

00:21:59.941 --> 00:22:03.180
is pushing the rod into the wall
and also pulling it up.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.944
The part that's pushing it to
the left has to be compensated

00:22:05.944 --> 00:22:08.980
by H.
But suppose the question they

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.920
ask you is, "What is the tension
on that rope?"

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.302
And suppose that's the crucial
issue because if the tension is

00:22:16.302 --> 00:22:18.410
too much the rope is going to
break.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:22.035
If you want only the tension,
once again the trick is,

00:22:22.035 --> 00:22:25.729
forget the force equation and
go to the torque equation

00:22:25.729 --> 00:22:27.431
because,
if you go to the torque

00:22:27.431 --> 00:22:29.309
equation, you banish both
V and H.

00:22:29.309 --> 00:22:31.150
I hope that's clear to all of
you.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.497
A force going through the pivot
point in any direction is

00:22:34.497 --> 00:22:36.650
incapable of producing any
torque.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.359
That's so intuitively clear,
we need not belabor that.

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:42.757
If you want the formula in
F times r times

00:22:42.757 --> 00:22:44.240
sin θ,
r is zero.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.250
So, we don't care what the
angle is.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.971
So, once again,
we'll take torques around this

00:22:48.971 --> 00:22:51.210
point and see what it will tell
us.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.622
So, the torque due to gravity,
we all agreed,

00:22:55.622 --> 00:22:59.032
we can now replace by
MgL/2,

00:22:59.032 --> 00:23:03.660
turning it this way.
So, this force exerts a torque

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:08.102
which is equal to the value of
the tension, the length of the

00:23:08.102 --> 00:23:11.730
rod and the sine of the angle
between the two,

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.838
which is this angle here.
So, the nice thing is,

00:23:14.838 --> 00:23:19.312
you can solve for the tension
directly in one shot,

00:23:19.312 --> 00:23:23.160
which is just Mg/2
sin θ.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.680
That's why θ cannot be
too small.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.481
If θ is too small,
at some point T will

00:23:35.481 --> 00:23:37.859
become so large that the string
will break.

00:23:37.859 --> 00:23:41.234
So, if you want to anchor a
sign, you've got to try to take

00:23:41.234 --> 00:23:44.900
a big angle like that so that
sin θ is not too small.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.344
So, one of the problems you
could be asked is,

00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:50.386
"What's the minimum
angle so that the rope doesn't

00:23:50.386 --> 00:23:52.421
break,
given that it can support a

00:23:52.421 --> 00:23:54.299
maximum tension of 1,000
Newtons?

00:23:54.299 --> 00:23:56.141
Well, then you put a 1,000
Newtons here,

00:23:56.141 --> 00:23:58.786
you know the M and the
g, you solve for the

00:23:58.786 --> 00:24:01.289
θ at which it crosses a
thousand Newtons.

00:24:01.289 --> 00:24:03.250
And your θ should be
bigger than that.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:08.192
Yeah?
Student:

00:24:08.192 --> 00:24:11.673
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:24:11.673 --> 00:24:17.160
Shankar: That was a
definition of the torque.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.958
If you go back,
then you've got to go back to

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:23.839
what we did earlier and you'll
find I deduced the other day--I

00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:27.019
said--Maybe I'll remind you how
that happened.

00:24:27.019 --> 00:24:29.529
I'm trying to the find the
analogue of F = ma.

00:24:29.529 --> 00:24:31.829
Analogue of ma is
Iα.

00:24:31.829 --> 00:24:34.986
And I said, "Who is the guy who
can play the role on the

00:24:34.986 --> 00:24:37.542
left-hand side?"
And I found the quantity that

00:24:37.542 --> 00:24:40.355
plays the role of Iα;
that's equal to Iα -- is the

00:24:40.355 --> 00:24:42.680
force times distance times
sin θ.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.273
Okay?
So, that's-- you-- look,

00:24:47.273 --> 00:24:49.776
you've got to understand why
torque has a sin θ in

00:24:49.776 --> 00:24:51.763
it.
If you want to rotate a body --

00:24:51.763 --> 00:24:54.599
take any body that you want to
rotate -- you know,

00:24:54.599 --> 00:24:58.496
here is a rod and you want to
rotate it, you pick a point,

00:24:58.496 --> 00:25:01.976
you want to apply a force.
We know intuitively that any

00:25:01.976 --> 00:25:04.439
force applied along this
direction is no use,

00:25:04.439 --> 00:25:08.204
in terms of rotating it.
The best way to apply a force

00:25:08.204 --> 00:25:12.170
of a given magnitude is to be
perpendicular to it.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:14.881
But if, for some reason,
you can only apply it at some

00:25:14.881 --> 00:25:17.849
angle, then this part of the
force is good for rotation and

00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:20.509
that part of the force is not
good for rotation.

00:25:20.509 --> 00:25:23.329
And the sin θ projects
out this part.

00:25:23.329 --> 00:25:26.495
If that angle is θ,
then F sin θ is really

00:25:26.495 --> 00:25:28.549
the perpendicular part of
F.

00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:30.380
So, that's how the torque is
defined.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.519
Okay.
So, we found the tension here.

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:41.210
If that's all you want to know,
that's the end of the problem.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.109
You're got the tension.
But you may be asked to do more.

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:48.140
You could be asked to now find
what's happening at the pivot.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.589
Then, you've got to go back to
the forces.

00:25:51.589 --> 00:25:54.085
So, in the horizontal
direction, in the x

00:25:54.085 --> 00:25:56.740
direction, the total forces have
to add to zero.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.782
So, H should be equal to
F, which should be equal

00:26:00.782 --> 00:26:04.824
to tension times cos θ
because this T has a T

00:26:04.824 --> 00:26:08.280
sin θ that way and T cos
θ that way.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.924
And this is T cos θ.
So, T cos θ is pushing

00:26:15.924 --> 00:26:18.920
in, the wall should push out.
And now I know the value of

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.339
T.
I put that in.

00:26:20.339 --> 00:26:24.250
Mg/2 cos θ
because that's cosine over sine.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.560
All right.
So, that's the horizontal part.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.549
How about the vertical part?
In the vertical direction,

00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:40.589
upward vertical force plus T
sin θ has to be the

00:26:40.589 --> 00:26:43.380
downward force,
which is Mg.

00:26:47.609 --> 00:26:48.330
Well, we know what T sin
θ is.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.356
We just did that.
T sin θ,

00:26:51.356 --> 00:26:53.751
if you look up here,
T sin θ is Mg/2

00:26:53.751 --> 00:27:00.240
= Mg.
That means V = Mg/2.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.029
That means, the pivot provides
half the support,

00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:07.899
half the mass.
And the tension's vertical part

00:27:07.899 --> 00:27:12.392
provides the other part.
So, I will give you a couple of

00:27:12.392 --> 00:27:16.939
seconds to think about this.
This is the kind of problem you

00:27:16.939 --> 00:27:19.450
guys should be easily able to
do.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.759
You isolate the rod,
you write all the forces on it.

00:27:22.759 --> 00:27:24.924
If you want,
maybe this--If this picture is

00:27:24.924 --> 00:27:27.140
not clear to you,
what I have in mind is,

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.240
I pull out the rod and say,
"Why is this rod not turning

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.820
and moving under all the forces
acting on it?"

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.346
Then I write the forces on it.
The tension is acting in that

00:27:38.346 --> 00:27:40.882
direction;
the pivot has a vertical force,

00:27:40.882 --> 00:27:44.032
the pivot has a horizontal
force, and gravity for this

00:27:44.032 --> 00:27:46.410
purpose I'll replace as acting
there.

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.958
Under the action of all these
forces, the rod is neither

00:27:49.958 --> 00:27:52.883
translating nor rotating.
That means the x

00:27:52.883 --> 00:27:55.869
component of the force adds to
zero, the y component

00:27:55.869 --> 00:27:57.980
adds to zero,
the torque adds to zero.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.389
If you've got three equations,
you can plug the numbers into

00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:03.470
any of them in any order you
like.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.529
In the end, you will all get
the same answer.

00:28:05.529 --> 00:28:07.307
But the way,
to get the answer most

00:28:07.307 --> 00:28:09.660
effectively is to take the
torque equation,

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.402
because the beauty of the
torque equation is that neither

00:28:12.402 --> 00:28:15.194
the vertical part nor the
horizontal part have anything to

00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:19.670
do with the pivot enters that.
So, bear that in mind.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.770
Now, you can embellish the
problem.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.099
I don't want to do that.
You can hang a weight here.

00:28:25.099 --> 00:28:28.759
I don't think it should cause a
new problem.

00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:31.273
Suppose there's an extra with,
a little m,

00:28:31.273 --> 00:28:34.974
on top of the mass of the rod.
I am actually hanging a weight

00:28:34.974 --> 00:28:37.111
here.
Well, all you have to do when

00:28:37.111 --> 00:28:40.753
you go to the torque equation,
is to remember that this weight

00:28:40.753 --> 00:28:43.559
going this way will provide an
extra torque.

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:46.309
That will be little m
times g times the whole

00:28:46.309 --> 00:28:48.537
length of the rod,
because I'm taking the torque

00:28:48.537 --> 00:28:51.288
around that point.
You put that in and you solve

00:28:51.288 --> 00:28:53.535
for the tension T;
then go back and,

00:28:53.535 --> 00:28:54.630
again, do the force part.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:04.913
Any questions about this so far?
Because I'm going to do now the

00:29:04.913 --> 00:29:08.786
last of these equilibrium
problems before I do something

00:29:08.786 --> 00:29:11.400
else.
The last of the equilibrium

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.893
problems is very standard fare
for this course,

00:29:14.893 --> 00:29:18.765
which is the problem I
mentioned in the beginning to

00:29:18.765 --> 00:29:22.356
motivate all of this.
And that is,

00:29:22.356 --> 00:29:30.441
if I have a ladder leaning on a
wall at some angle θ,

00:29:30.441 --> 00:29:36.504
you can ask yourself,
"Is there a limit to the

00:29:36.504 --> 00:29:39.931
θ?"
Do you think there's going to

00:29:39.931 --> 00:29:42.166
be some kind of limit,
and if so, what kind of limit

00:29:42.166 --> 00:29:43.850
will it be?
A lower limit or an upper limit?

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.905
Would you like to guess?
Student:

00:29:50.905 --> 00:29:51.864
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:29:51.864 --> 00:29:53.230
Shankar: A lower limit on
the θ?

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.239
By that you mean what,
the θ is less than some

00:29:56.239 --> 00:29:57.609
amount?
What'll happen?

00:29:57.609 --> 00:29:58.071
Student:
[inaudible]

00:29:58.071 --> 00:29:58.940
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: It'll fall.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.743
Very good.
So, for equilibrium,

00:30:00.743 --> 00:30:03.049
there'll be a lower limit on
θ.

00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:06.981
I think it's clear to all of us
that if you're trying to climb a

00:30:06.981 --> 00:30:10.601
building and you put a ladder
like this, you are asking for

00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:12.220
trouble.
Right?

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.643
Yeah?
Student:

00:30:13.643 --> 00:30:16.283
So, there's also an upper limit
of θ[inaudible]

00:30:16.283 --> 00:30:17.409
you know,
90 degrees [inaudible]

00:30:17.409 --> 00:30:18.390
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Look,

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.528
I agree.
You mean 91 degrees,

00:30:20.528 --> 00:30:23.440
ladder like this.
Yes.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.599
I agree with you.
I don't recommend that either.

00:30:26.599 --> 00:30:31.680
So, between--Are you a
mathematician?

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.900
Because they always find out
something wrong in anything I

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.441
say.
I say, "Good morning," they

00:30:36.441 --> 00:30:38.890
say, "Well, not quite you know,
let's look into this."

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:40.950
Philosophers,
even more difficult,

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.289
"What is good?
What is morning?

00:30:43.289 --> 00:30:45.440
It's morning here,
it's nighttime in California."

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.891
But look, every time I make up
an exam for a question I run it

00:30:49.891 --> 00:30:52.809
by a lot of students and a lot
of TAs.

00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:55.673
Because when I'm talking to
you, I have a certain notion of

00:30:55.673 --> 00:30:58.141
what I'm talking about,
but the same words can mean

00:30:58.141 --> 00:30:59.999
something else.
And quite often,

00:30:59.999 --> 00:31:03.043
I am tripped up by this,
though this is the first that

00:31:03.043 --> 00:31:06.880
this question has come up.
So, I learn something every day.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.601
All right.
Anyway, let's say we're going

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:13.730
to limit ourselves 0 to 90.
And what angle can it take?

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:16.166
What's the minimum angle?
What do you think is going to

00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:16.950
control that angle?

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.751
Yeah?
Student:

00:31:21.751 --> 00:31:23.537
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:31:23.537 --> 00:31:26.190
Shankar: The [inaudible]
between the what?

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.171
Student:
The bottom of the ladder and

00:31:27.171 --> 00:31:28.015
the [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:31:28.015 --> 00:31:29.170
Shankar: Right.
Okay.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.956
So, in fact,
it turns out even the

00:31:30.956 --> 00:31:33.880
coefficient of the friction with
this wall may help,

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.444
but we are going to rely on a
problem where the wall is

00:31:36.444 --> 00:31:38.630
frictionless and the floor has
the friction.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.992
And it's got a static friction
μ, which I'm just going

00:31:41.992 --> 00:31:45.660
to give to you.
So, here is our challenge now.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:49.859
We want to see why this rod is
not falling.

00:31:49.859 --> 00:31:51.799
So, let's just write down all
the equations.

00:31:51.799 --> 00:31:54.750
So, whenever you get any
rotation problem,

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.269
rule number one is "don't
panic."

00:31:57.269 --> 00:32:00.867
Write down the three great
conditions and it will all

00:32:00.867 --> 00:32:03.162
happen.
The first condition is,

00:32:03.162 --> 00:32:06.870
well, zero condition is,
draw all the forces on this

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.921
guy.
So, what forces do you want to

00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:11.212
draw?
I think we have learned over

00:32:11.212 --> 00:32:14.894
and over Mg can be
assumed to be acting in the

00:32:14.894 --> 00:32:18.010
middle of the rod,
the center of the rod.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:22.040
The wall is very important.
If it's a frictionless wall,

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.794
then the only force it can
exert is perpendicular to

00:32:25.794 --> 00:32:27.423
itself.
That's the meaning of

00:32:27.423 --> 00:32:29.519
frictionless.
You cannot apply a force along

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:32.154
the length of the rod.
So, let's give that name

00:32:32.154 --> 00:32:36.819
W for wall.
I come to the floor now.

00:32:36.819 --> 00:32:40.200
The floor is exerting a force
N, standard name for

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.359
normal or perpendicular.
Then, it's exerting a

00:32:43.359 --> 00:32:47.069
frictional force f,
which will be inward.

00:32:47.069 --> 00:32:50.285
Because the ladder is trying to
slide out, you will apply a

00:32:50.285 --> 00:32:53.390
static frictional force inward
to keep it from moving.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:56.753
That's it.
These are the forces,

00:32:56.753 --> 00:32:59.774
and subject to these forces we
have to write down all the

00:32:59.774 --> 00:33:02.769
conditions.
This angle is θ here.

00:33:02.769 --> 00:33:06.870
For the x motion,
the fact that all the -- maybe

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:11.350
I should write it -- sum of all
the x forces is zero,

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.780
simply it says W = F.

00:33:18.369 --> 00:33:23.458
Sum of all the y forces
equals--tells me N =

00:33:23.458 --> 00:33:24.530
Mg.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.393
Right.
All that is left is the torque,

00:33:33.393 --> 00:33:34.880
and that's where you have the
choice.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.030
You can take the torque around
any point you like.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.553
You can take that point;
in fact, you can take a point

00:33:39.553 --> 00:33:41.829
here.
Okay.

00:33:41.829 --> 00:33:44.136
If you want to really punish
yourself, you can take a torque

00:33:44.136 --> 00:33:46.559
around some crazy point and then
N and f will all

00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:49.099
come into problem and you will
have to work that much harder.

00:33:49.099 --> 00:33:51.779
So, the trick again,
take the torque here.

00:33:51.779 --> 00:33:54.769
Then N and f are
gone, and what do I have?

00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:56.670
I have Mg trying to
rotate it this way;

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:58.599
I have W trying to
rotate it that way.

00:33:58.599 --> 00:34:01.260
I'm just going to balance the
magnitudes of the two torques.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.251
So, what equations will I get?
For W,

00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:09.320
it is W times L
times sin θ.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.019
Now, here is where you
shouldn't simply write it down.

00:34:12.019 --> 00:34:15.204
You've got to make sure that
you would have written this

00:34:15.204 --> 00:34:17.438
down.
Going back to the definition of

00:34:17.438 --> 00:34:20.858
torque, force times distance
from the pivot point times the

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:23.806
sine of the angle between the
force and the line of

00:34:23.806 --> 00:34:25.938
separation.
W is the force,

00:34:25.938 --> 00:34:29.341
the distance is L -- the
length of the ladder -- and this

00:34:29.341 --> 00:34:32.798
θ and that θ are
equal by some theorem we learned

00:34:32.798 --> 00:34:36.093
in high school that if you've
got two parallel lines the angle

00:34:36.093 --> 00:34:38.776
is the same.
So, the sin θ you want

00:34:38.776 --> 00:34:42.849
to use is that.
That's the torque.

00:34:42.849 --> 00:34:45.570
That's the torque due to the
wall.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:51.410
The torque due to gravity is
MgL/2 cos θ.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.280
Now, why did I write cos
θ?

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.925
Am I making a mistake?
Instead of sin θ,

00:35:00.925 --> 00:35:02.960
why is it cos θ?

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.308
Yes?
Student:

00:35:10.308 --> 00:35:13.243
Because that angle it makes
with the ladder is the

00:35:13.243 --> 00:35:15.324
complimentary of θ.
Professor Ramamurti

00:35:15.324 --> 00:35:17.489
Shankar: Yeah.
So, let me repeat the answer.

00:35:17.489 --> 00:35:21.585
When you write torque as MgL
sin θ, the θ is not

00:35:21.585 --> 00:35:25.030
some fixed angle that somebody
drew in the diagram.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:29.839
It varies from force to force.
It's the angle that force makes

00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:33.222
with the line connecting the
point of application with the

00:35:33.222 --> 00:35:37.269
force to the point of rotation.
So, Mg is acting here.

00:35:37.269 --> 00:35:40.214
You want the angle between the
direction of Mg and the

00:35:40.214 --> 00:35:43.110
direction of the line of
separation, which is this angle.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.868
We really want the sine of this
angle, but sine of that angle is

00:35:46.868 --> 00:35:51.739
cosine of this angle.
So, you can cancel that.

00:35:51.739 --> 00:35:59.619
So, I find W equals Mg/2
cos θ.

00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:04.949
Just the torque equation tells
me that's the W I need.

00:36:04.949 --> 00:36:07.660
The wall's going to push out
with that W,

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.909
and you better be able to fight
that.

00:36:09.909 --> 00:36:12.232
To fight that,
that W should be equal

00:36:12.232 --> 00:36:14.610
to f, which is what we've
got here.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:19.380
That's fine too.
But now we have a restriction.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.179
f cannot be arbitrarily
big.

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:24.502
f is less than or equal
to the coefficient of static

00:36:24.502 --> 00:36:26.450
friction times the normal force.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.710
Yeah?
Student:

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.309
Could you explain why you used
the cos θ?

00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:35.949
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

00:36:35.949 --> 00:36:39.567
So, I want to find the torque
due to the force of gravity

00:36:39.567 --> 00:36:42.280
acting there with respect to
this point.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.192
By the definition of the
torque, you take the force,

00:36:45.192 --> 00:36:48.162
you join the point of
application of the force to the

00:36:48.162 --> 00:36:51.646
point around which you are doing
the torque and take the angle

00:36:51.646 --> 00:36:54.993
between those two lines.
So, it's really that angle,

00:36:54.993 --> 00:36:56.989
which is not the θ
here.

00:36:56.989 --> 00:37:01.401
But if I draw the picture here,
you can see this is θ,

00:37:01.401 --> 00:37:05.090
this is 90 – θ,
this angle that I want.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:08.660
But then, sine of 90 -
θ is cos θ.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:12.950
And that's why you use that.
Sine of 90 - θ is

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:16.031
cos θ because when you
change θ and 90 -

00:37:16.031 --> 00:37:18.195
θ,
what's opposite becomes

00:37:18.195 --> 00:37:21.130
adjacent and what's adjacent
becomes opposite.

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:23.402
In any right triangle,
if that's your angle,

00:37:23.402 --> 00:37:25.199
that's called the adjacent
side.

00:37:25.199 --> 00:37:27.407
But if that's your angle,
that's called the adjacent

00:37:27.407 --> 00:37:29.480
side.
So, sine and cosine exchange

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.390
places when θ goes to 90
- θ.

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.968
All right.
So, coming back again,

00:37:34.968 --> 00:37:38.609
I did this cancellation.
I got that to be equal to the

00:37:38.609 --> 00:37:41.560
force of friction but that's
bounded by this.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.646
But I know N = Mg.
So, bring this equation here,

00:37:44.646 --> 00:37:46.736
so that's equal to
μ_S times

00:37:46.736 --> 00:37:50.497
Mg.
So, I have the restriction that

00:37:50.497 --> 00:37:56.710
Mg/2 cos θ--;So,
let's compare that to that and

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:02.618
we find the restriction that
Mg/2 cos θ less

00:38:02.618 --> 00:38:06.998
than or equal to
μ_S times

00:38:06.998 --> 00:38:10.706
Mg.
You cancel the Mg,

00:38:10.706 --> 00:38:15.369
and you find cos θ has
to be less than or equal to 2

00:38:15.369 --> 00:38:17.820
times μ_S.

00:38:22.809 --> 00:38:27.700
I like to write it as tan
θ has to be bigger than or

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:31.679
equal to 1 over 2 times
μ_S.

00:38:31.679 --> 00:38:36.010
Do you know how we went from
here to here?

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.499
If this number is smaller than
this number, the reciprocal of

00:38:39.499 --> 00:38:42.930
this number is bigger than the
reciprocal of this number.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:46.920
Three is smaller than 10;
1/3 is bigger than 1/10.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.285
Same thing.
So, I'm somehow used to tangent

00:38:50.285 --> 00:38:53.666
better than the cos,
so I flip this over and I flip

00:38:53.666 --> 00:38:57.519
that over and I also changed
less than to bigger than.

00:38:57.519 --> 00:39:00.215
This way we can understand
tan θ has to be bigger

00:39:00.215 --> 00:39:02.426
than some number.
That means θ has to be

00:39:02.426 --> 00:39:04.802
bigger than some number,
because tan θ increases

00:39:04.802 --> 00:39:06.716
with θ.
So, you tell me what your

00:39:06.716 --> 00:39:11.250
coefficient of friction is.
Maybe it's .5, then this is 1.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:13.648
Tan θ should be bigger
than 1, θ should be

00:39:13.648 --> 00:39:14.700
bigger than 45 degrees.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.719
Okay.
Or π /4.

00:39:21.719 --> 00:39:26.398
Maybe I should keep using
radians so you guys get used to

00:39:26.398 --> 00:39:29.489
radians as a way to think about
it.

00:39:29.489 --> 00:39:36.510
So, what's the famous show on
CNN, Anderson Cooper--what?

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:39.968
Anderson Cooper 2π.
That's what it is for this

00:39:39.968 --> 00:39:41.749
class.
Think radians or you're going

00:39:41.749 --> 00:39:43.909
to screw up somewhere.
Okay?

00:39:43.909 --> 00:39:47.205
Angle is what we use every day,
but radians is what we use

00:39:47.205 --> 00:39:49.338
here.
When I write a tan θ

00:39:49.338 --> 00:39:52.980
and I don't tell you what it is,
or if I tell you tangential

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.449
velocity is ω times
r,

00:39:55.449 --> 00:39:59.719
that velocity--angular velocity
ω is radians per second.

00:39:59.719 --> 00:40:01.410
A lot of people get tripped
over this.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:04.431
Okay?
It's a very natural way to

00:40:04.431 --> 00:40:06.530
measure angles,
and you guys get used to that.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:10.623
Okay.
So, this is a collection of

00:40:10.623 --> 00:40:13.300
problems all in the xy
plane.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:18.026
Rigid body dynamics is quite
manageable as long as everything

00:40:18.026 --> 00:40:21.692
lies in the xy plane.
If the plane of the blackboard

00:40:21.692 --> 00:40:23.776
is the xy plane,
notice that everything is

00:40:23.776 --> 00:40:25.340
happening in the xy
plane.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.826
All the mass is concentrated on
the plane, all the forces are in

00:40:28.826 --> 00:40:31.424
the plane;
all the vectors separating the

00:40:31.424 --> 00:40:35.550
point of the torque to the point
of the force are in the plane.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:39.880
But now, you have to deal with
the fact that in real life

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:44.234
objects are not just planar.
They are chunks like a top or a

00:40:44.234 --> 00:40:46.870
potato.
So, living in three dimensions,

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:50.682
and rigid body dynamics in
three dimensions is one of the

00:40:50.682 --> 00:40:54.579
most complicated fields.
So, we're not going to do that.

00:40:54.579 --> 00:40:59.326
We're going to take a rather
simpler version of the rigid

00:40:59.326 --> 00:41:02.462
body problem,
basically the problem of

00:41:02.462 --> 00:41:07.043
torques and forces in 3D,
but apply it in a very limited

00:41:07.043 --> 00:41:10.492
context.
The limited context I have set

00:41:10.492 --> 00:41:16.400
for myself right now is to just
apply it to single point mass.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.546
What does the analogue of τ
= Iα when the mass is not

00:41:20.546 --> 00:41:24.692
moving in the xy plane
but just running around all over

00:41:24.692 --> 00:41:27.219
three dimensions.
How do you define torque?

00:41:27.219 --> 00:41:30.239
How do you define angular
momentum in 3D?

00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:33.579
You will find this a--it's not
a straightforward extension.

00:41:33.579 --> 00:41:35.809
You have to think a little
harder.

00:41:35.809 --> 00:41:39.110
So, let me motivate the problem
we have.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:43.390
Suppose I have a body in the
xy plane.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:45.273
Right?
It's a sheet of metal or

00:41:45.273 --> 00:41:50.192
something.
And it is spinning and a torque

00:41:50.192 --> 00:41:54.073
is applied here.
This is r,

00:41:54.073 --> 00:41:57.389
and a force F is applied
here.

00:41:57.389 --> 00:41:58.450
This is the kind of problem
we've been studying.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:05.408
We know that the torque in this
case is going to rotate in a

00:42:05.408 --> 00:42:09.079
counter-clockwise direction.
If the forces are opposite it

00:42:09.079 --> 00:42:11.360
will rotate in a clockwise
direction.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.787
So, whenever I did a torque
calculation, the torque was

00:42:13.787 --> 00:42:15.719
either plus something or minus
something.

00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:18.300
Plus meant counter-clockwise,
minus meant clockwise.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:22.429
If I got ten different torques,
I just add up all of them with

00:42:22.429 --> 00:42:25.340
proper attention to plus and
minus signs.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:30.053
But now, imagine that this body
is actually--You don't even need

00:42:30.053 --> 00:42:33.333
a potato for this.
Just take the same flat sheet,

00:42:33.333 --> 00:42:36.782
but it's now not living in the
xy plane but floating

00:42:36.782 --> 00:42:40.556
somewhere in space,
and somewhere there on its

00:42:40.556 --> 00:42:46.060
surface is a force pulling it
with a separation r.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:50.862
What does that torque do?
The torque will certainly

00:42:50.862 --> 00:42:56.764
provide a counter -- let me see
-- a counter-clockwise rotation,

00:42:56.764 --> 00:43:00.980
but around this axis,
piercing the sample.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.713
So, we know it's
counter-clockwise,

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:05.722
but it's not enough to say it's
counter-clockwise because in

00:43:05.722 --> 00:43:08.119
this problem it is
counter-clockwise around that

00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:11.031
axis.
So, when a body is rotated in

00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:15.329
more than two dimensions,
the body will tend to rotate

00:43:15.329 --> 00:43:19.869
around an axis either clockwise
or counter-clockwise,

00:43:19.869 --> 00:43:22.590
but the axis itself has to be
specified.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:26.018
As long as your body was stuck
to the xy plane,

00:43:26.018 --> 00:43:28.670
it had to rotate around
az axis.

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:30.972
I'm just telling you,
if you liberate the condition

00:43:30.972 --> 00:43:33.873
and throw it in free space like
Frisbee--A Frisbee can rotate at

00:43:33.873 --> 00:43:36.450
any instant.
Here's a flying Frisbee;

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:40.921
it's rotating around some axis.
So, in order to say that the

00:43:40.921 --> 00:43:44.651
torque is producing rotations,
we want to characterize not

00:43:44.651 --> 00:43:48.772
only the magnitude of the torque
but also tell you the direction

00:43:48.772 --> 00:43:51.390
in which it will produce
rotations.

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:55.071
So, there is a trick we use.
The trick is,

00:43:55.071 --> 00:43:59.182
we are going to somehow
indicate that the effect of this

00:43:59.182 --> 00:44:03.070
torque is to produce a rotation
around that axis.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:07.800
So, we are going to introduce a
new vector τ;

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.720
τ, which was so far a
scalar is going to be now

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.577
promoted to a vector.
And the vector will be denoted

00:44:15.577 --> 00:44:18.639
by this symbol,
called a "cross product."

00:44:18.639 --> 00:44:24.059
But I will now tell you how to
get τ as a vector.

00:44:24.059 --> 00:44:25.789
We know r and we know
F.

00:44:25.789 --> 00:44:28.300
But the torque,
we suddenly learn,

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.944
is actually a vector.
So, well, if it's a vector it

00:44:31.944 --> 00:44:34.820
needs a magnitude and it needs a
direction.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.416
The magnitude of the vector is
the old thing,

00:44:38.416 --> 00:44:39.970
Fr sin θ.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.955
I hope you people understand
that in three dimensions,

00:44:47.955 --> 00:44:50.881
even in three dimensions,
if r and F are two

00:44:50.881 --> 00:44:53.215
vectors, you know,
they can move around like these

00:44:53.215 --> 00:44:55.610
two fingers;
they define a plane.

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:58.708
And in that plane,
there is a clear angle between

00:44:58.708 --> 00:45:03.199
these two vectors.
That's the angle I mean.

00:45:03.199 --> 00:45:04.969
So, here is the vector of
r.

00:45:04.969 --> 00:45:07.196
If you want,
extend the vector r like

00:45:07.196 --> 00:45:09.889
that, that's the θ that
I'm talking about.

00:45:09.889 --> 00:45:14.599
Now, once you have two vectors
defining a plane -- here is one

00:45:14.599 --> 00:45:19.231
vector, here is another vector
-- there is a perpendicular to

00:45:19.231 --> 00:45:24.480
that plane.
Every plane has a perpendicular.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.290
There's only one ambiguity;
it is that if I give you

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:30.332
something planar like this,
I can draw two perpendiculars,

00:45:30.332 --> 00:45:32.199
one going up and one going
down.

00:45:32.199 --> 00:45:34.099
Both are perpendicular to the
plane.

00:45:34.099 --> 00:45:38.152
So, we have to make a choice on
what direction I want to

00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:42.351
associate with this τ.
And that's where you use the

00:45:42.351 --> 00:45:46.041
right-hand rule.
The rule says--There are lots

00:45:46.041 --> 00:45:50.550
of names for this rule.
Let's first take a simple case.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:54.839
Here is r;
and let me bring the F

00:45:54.839 --> 00:45:58.940
vector and draw it like this.
I want to define the cross

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.530
product, r cross
F.

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.438
Its magnitude is this,
length of r,

00:46:03.438 --> 00:46:05.300
length of F,
sine of the angle.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.091
I'm trying to pick a direction.
Either direction,

00:46:08.091 --> 00:46:10.107
in this case,
is going to be out of the

00:46:10.107 --> 00:46:12.070
blackboard or into the
blackboard.

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:15.219
And the convention is stated in
many different ways.

00:46:15.219 --> 00:46:21.328
One convention is,
you take this r and you

00:46:21.328 --> 00:46:27.310
turn a screwdriver from r
to F.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.679
Okay?
You guys imagine in your mind;

00:46:30.679 --> 00:46:33.280
take a screwdriver,
turn the screwdriver from

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.926
r to F.
Which way will this--That's

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:36.940
right.
You see.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.889
That's what all the rap guys
are doing.

00:46:38.889 --> 00:46:40.912
They're trying to use the
right-hand rule,

00:46:40.912 --> 00:46:43.429
because the right-hand rule
says that if you have an

00:46:43.429 --> 00:46:46.340
r and if you have an
F that's the torque.

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:49.195
I've not followed the lyrics
very closely,

00:46:49.195 --> 00:46:53.164
but I believe they're muttering
something about forces and

00:46:53.164 --> 00:46:54.820
torques.
Okay.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:59.376
So, here is the right-hand rule.
If this is r and that is

00:46:59.376 --> 00:47:01.050
F, then that's the
torque.

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:04.067
But I find it much easier to do
another right-hand rule,

00:47:04.067 --> 00:47:06.860
which is like this.
You can see that in books too.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.936
Curl your fingers.
The rule says,

00:47:08.936 --> 00:47:12.049
from r to F,
and whichever way your thumb

00:47:12.049 --> 00:47:15.450
points, that's the direction of
r cross F.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.389
I think it's very clear if you
write it that way;

00:47:21.389 --> 00:47:24.750
that r cross F is
minus F cross r.

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:28.059
So, you've got to be very
careful when you take this cross

00:47:28.059 --> 00:47:29.719
product.
The order in which you multiply

00:47:29.719 --> 00:47:30.800
the vectors is very important.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:36.678
Okay.
So, in this example r

00:47:36.678 --> 00:47:38.889
cross F--Are you guys
ready now.

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:41.750
I'm not going to tell you the
answer, but think for a second.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:44.462
r cross F in this
example, if you turn a

00:47:44.462 --> 00:47:47.532
screwdriver or do the right-hand
rule, it's coming out of the

00:47:47.532 --> 00:47:50.104
blackboard.
That is the direction of the

00:47:50.104 --> 00:47:51.811
torque.
You can imagine these two

00:47:51.811 --> 00:47:53.860
vectors, which are in the
xy plane;

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:56.300
lift them upon and turn them
into free space.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.096
It doesn't matter.
They still define a

00:47:58.096 --> 00:48:00.389
perpendicular direction
uniquely, by turning the

00:48:00.389 --> 00:48:02.925
screwdriver from r to
F or curling your

00:48:02.925 --> 00:48:04.639
fingers,
or doing whatever you want;

00:48:04.639 --> 00:48:06.360
that's the direction of the
torque.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:10.403
So, torque is a vector.
By the way, that's an

00:48:10.403 --> 00:48:14.710
accidental property of living in
three dimensions.

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:17.159
If you take two vectors
A and B,

00:48:17.159 --> 00:48:20.372
we can define a cross product
C equals A cross

00:48:20.372 --> 00:48:21.080
B.

00:48:24.099 --> 00:48:27.617
The rule for what C is
equal to, is that the length of

00:48:27.617 --> 00:48:29.670
C is a length of
A,

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:32.219
the length of B and the
sine of the angle between them.

00:48:32.219 --> 00:48:35.317
And the direction of C
is found by taking the plane in

00:48:35.317 --> 00:48:38.465
which A and B lie
and drawing a perpendicular to

00:48:38.465 --> 00:48:41.356
the plane in the sense that you
rotate a screwdriver from

00:48:41.356 --> 00:48:44.203
A to B.
If you're living in four

00:48:44.203 --> 00:48:47.960
dimensions, if I give you two
vectors like these two fingers,

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:50.150
well, that's perpendicular to
it, you can see,

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:53.119
but there's one other whole
fourth dimension you don't see.

00:48:53.119 --> 00:48:56.488
So, in four dimensions,
there is not one perpendicular

00:48:56.488 --> 00:48:59.410
direction to a plane.
There are two perpendicular

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:01.779
directions.
So, you cannot take the cross

00:49:01.779 --> 00:49:04.980
product and turn it into a
vector in four dimensions.

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:08.258
It's a beautiful property of
three dimensions that one is

00:49:08.258 --> 00:49:11.595
able to take two vectors and
manufacture from them a third

00:49:11.595 --> 00:49:14.508
vector.
So, that's an accident of 3D,

00:49:14.508 --> 00:49:19.281
but we live in 3D so we exploit
this a lot, and it's a natural

00:49:19.281 --> 00:49:23.349
quantity to bring in when you
talk about torques.

00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:26.090
Now, the whole cross product is
something one can go on and on.

00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:28.059
I don't want to talk for too
long.

00:49:28.059 --> 00:49:30.817
Let me just point out a couple
of properties of the cross

00:49:30.817 --> 00:49:32.803
product.
One is that A cross

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:35.789
B is equal to minus
B cross A,

00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:38.320
because when you turn the
screwdriver from A to

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.815
B it advances one way.
If it's B to A,

00:49:40.815 --> 00:49:43.451
it goes the other way.
One particular consequence of

00:49:43.451 --> 00:49:46.671
this is that A cross
A is zero because

00:49:46.671 --> 00:49:50.460
A cross A is minus
A cross A;

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.519
that means A cross
A is zero.

00:49:52.519 --> 00:49:55.465
It also follows from the fact
that the angle between A

00:49:55.465 --> 00:49:58.510
and A is zero degrees,
so the sin θ vanishes.

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:03.342
If you want to get practice,
you can practice some simple

00:50:03.342 --> 00:50:06.692
cross products.
Here is a unit vector I,

00:50:06.692 --> 00:50:10.579
here is a unit vector J,
here is a unit vector K.

00:50:10.579 --> 00:50:13.510
So let's try I cross
J.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:16.163
I cross J is a
vector perpendicular to I

00:50:16.163 --> 00:50:17.179
and J,
namely,

00:50:17.179 --> 00:50:20.571
pointing in the Z
direction, whose length is equal

00:50:20.571 --> 00:50:23.579
to 1 times 1 times sine of 90,
which is 1.

00:50:23.579 --> 00:50:26.059
Therefore, this is none other
than K.

00:50:26.059 --> 00:50:30.496
I cross J is
K, but that's equal to

00:50:30.496 --> 00:50:33.320
minus of J cross
I.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.136
If you went from J to
I, you turned the

00:50:35.136 --> 00:50:37.231
screwdriver from J to
I, the screw will go down

00:50:37.231 --> 00:50:39.263
the z axis.
So, I cross J and

00:50:39.263 --> 00:50:41.300
J cross I are
opposite of each other,

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.889
and I cross I is
zero.

00:50:42.889 --> 00:50:46.548
By the way, you will find with
your hands one turn would be

00:50:46.548 --> 00:50:48.152
easy.
The other would require all

00:50:48.152 --> 00:50:50.787
kinds of contortions.
So, what I suggest you do--do

00:50:50.787 --> 00:50:54.336
it for the easier one and then
flip the sign because I saw you

00:50:54.336 --> 00:50:57.770
going through some unnecessary
torment in the front row.

00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:00.404
I have the same problem.
I've seen people doing-- you

00:51:00.404 --> 00:51:03.562
know, at my age I shouldn't even
be doing the cross product

00:51:03.562 --> 00:51:05.849
because you can end up in the
hospital.

00:51:05.849 --> 00:51:07.369
So, anyway, it's a game for the
young.

00:51:07.369 --> 00:51:10.551
You can do the cross product
your way, but one day you will

00:51:10.551 --> 00:51:13.404
learn to follow my way,
which is do the easy product,

00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:15.739
then turn the sign around.
All right.

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:18.387
So, I don't want to spend too
much time, but let me just

00:51:18.387 --> 00:51:20.889
mention one thing because of the
homework problem.

00:51:20.889 --> 00:51:23.940
Remember the dot product I said
is A dot B,

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.154
is length of A length of
B cosine of the angle

00:51:27.154 --> 00:51:29.172
between them.
But I told you another way to

00:51:29.172 --> 00:51:30.753
do A dot B,
A_xB

00:51:30.753 --> 00:51:32.071
_x +
A_yB

00:51:32.071 --> 00:51:33.646
_y.
You get that by writing

00:51:33.646 --> 00:51:35.303
A as I times
A_x plus

00:51:35.303 --> 00:51:36.570
J times
A_y,

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:39.219
likewise for B and
taking all the different dot

00:51:39.219 --> 00:51:41.320
products when you open all the
brackets,

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.305
that's where you get
A_xB_x +

00:51:43.305 --> 00:51:46.018
A_yB_y.
There, because I dot

00:51:46.018 --> 00:51:49.191
I is 1 and J dot
J is 1 and I dot

00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:51.360
J vanishes for the dot
product.

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.260
Cross product is exactly the
opposite.

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.373
If you write I times
A_x + J

00:51:56.373 --> 00:51:58.628
times J_y +
K times

00:51:58.628 --> 00:52:02.121
A_z,
cross product with similar

00:52:02.121 --> 00:52:04.533
things for B.
I times

00:52:04.533 --> 00:52:07.323
B_x + J
times B_y,

00:52:07.323 --> 00:52:08.301
etc.
K times

00:52:08.301 --> 00:52:10.718
B_z.
There are, in principle,

00:52:10.718 --> 00:52:13.360
nine terms you can get in the
cross product.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.729
Three of them will vanish,
because when you take I

00:52:15.729 --> 00:52:17.210
cross I you will get
zero.

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:18.976
When you take I cross
J, you will get

00:52:18.976 --> 00:52:20.380
something.
When you take J cross

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.780
I, you will get minus
something.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.056
You put them all together -- I
won't do this now -- it will

00:52:24.056 --> 00:52:25.666
look like I times
A_xB

00:52:25.666 --> 00:52:27.040
_y -
A_yB

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.807
_x [correction:
should have said

00:52:28.807 --> 00:52:31.241
A_yB_z -
A_zB_y]

00:52:31.241 --> 00:52:33.949
plus J times something
and K times something.

00:52:33.949 --> 00:52:36.449
I don't need this,
so I'm not going to dwell on

00:52:36.449 --> 00:52:38.036
this.
It's good enough for our

00:52:38.036 --> 00:52:40.950
purposes to know the cross
product can be visualized as the

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:44.066
vector perpendicular to the two
vectors forming the product and

00:52:44.066 --> 00:52:47.081
of length equal to length of
A length of B sine

00:52:47.081 --> 00:52:48.740
of the angle between them.

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:54.446
Okay.
So, why did I introduce a cross

00:52:54.446 --> 00:52:57.230
product?
Well, here is the point.

00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:04.410
I have introduced torque as
r cross F.

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:07.541
I hope you know what that means.
If a force is acting at the

00:53:07.541 --> 00:53:10.857
point with vector r
measured from some origin,

00:53:10.857 --> 00:53:14.619
the torque due to that force is
r cross F.

00:53:14.619 --> 00:53:18.467
Now, I'm going to introduce,
for a single point mass

00:53:18.467 --> 00:53:21.107
somewhere here,
an angular momentum,

00:53:21.107 --> 00:53:24.050
which is also going to be a
vector.

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.929
Previously, angular momentum
Iω was not a vector.

00:53:26.929 --> 00:53:29.239
We just say it's spinning
clockwise or counter-clockwise.

00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:31.848
Now, for a single point mass,
moving in some direction,

00:53:31.848 --> 00:53:34.602
I'm going to introduce the
angular momentum to be r

00:53:34.602 --> 00:53:35.520
cross p.

00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.418
This is an inspired definition
and you will find that it's a

00:53:42.418 --> 00:53:45.070
good definition because things
will work out.

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:49.699
What's the first thing this
definition to satisfy?

00:53:49.699 --> 00:53:52.880
Anybody have an idea what we
expect?

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.409
What relation do I expect
between torque and L?

00:53:56.409 --> 00:53:57.883
Student:
[inaudible]

00:53:57.883 --> 00:54:00.773
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Torque should be

00:54:00.773 --> 00:54:03.360
the derivative of L.
Right.

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:07.397
So, were you going to say that?
So, I expect if things are

00:54:07.397 --> 00:54:10.630
working out τ should be
dL/dt.

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:12.389
So, let's see what dL/dt
is.

00:54:12.389 --> 00:54:19.570
The rate of change of angular
momentum is going to be

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:28.270
dr/dt cross p plus
r cross dp/dt.

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:30.948
I just used a rule of calculus.
When you've got a product,

00:54:30.948 --> 00:54:33.619
you take the derivative of this
and then the derivative of that.

00:54:33.619 --> 00:54:38.606
But dr/dt is the
velocity cross momentum plus

00:54:38.606 --> 00:54:43.397
r cross the force,
if the rate of change of

00:54:43.397 --> 00:54:48.630
momentum is the force.
Now, this guy we like.

00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:51.890
That's the torque.
This guy we don't like.

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:58.280
But that'll be zero.
So, you know why that is zero,

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:03.558
v cross p?
Student:

00:55:03.558 --> 00:55:10.089
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:55:10.089 --> 00:55:14.530
Shankar: No.
Yes?

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:16.395
Student:
Because p = mv where

00:55:16.395 --> 00:55:17.949
v is the same as
velocity.

00:55:17.949 --> 00:55:18.300
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.239
So, velocity and momentum are
parallel.

00:55:20.239 --> 00:55:22.159
They're just connected by a
number m.

00:55:22.159 --> 00:55:24.709
But if you take two parallel
vectors, their cross product

00:55:24.709 --> 00:55:26.530
will vanish because sin
θ = 0.

00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:30.307
So luckily, that drops out and
we do have this very nice result

00:55:30.307 --> 00:55:33.050
that if I define angular
momentum this way,

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:36.130
then the rate of change of
angular momentum is the torque

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:39.100
where torque was defined as
r cross F.

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:48.216
So, let me convince you that
these definitions in three

00:55:48.216 --> 00:55:52.376
dimensions are fully compatible
with what we have been doing all

00:55:52.376 --> 00:55:56.547
this time in two dimensions.
Let me convince you this is not

00:55:56.547 --> 00:56:00.340
a brand new definition.
Let's go back to 2D and ask,

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:04.820
"What does all of this look
like when I apply it to 2D?"

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:08.652
So, go to two dimensions now.
Let's put that in the--Let's

00:56:08.652 --> 00:56:12.663
take some object.
Take a tiny piece of gum stuck

00:56:12.663 --> 00:56:16.389
to some rotating rigid body
first.

00:56:16.389 --> 00:56:20.476
What do we say is the angular
momentum according to this

00:56:20.476 --> 00:56:23.377
formula?
Angular momentum is r

00:56:23.377 --> 00:56:25.560
cross p.
This is r.

00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:27.626
Right?
If it's a part of the rigid

00:56:27.626 --> 00:56:31.652
body, it can only move that way.
I'm first taking the case where

00:56:31.652 --> 00:56:35.820
the mass I'm considering is
embedded on a rigid body.

00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:39.376
Then when you rotate it,
it has to go along a circle

00:56:39.376 --> 00:56:42.828
with that as the radius.
So, the momentum p will

00:56:42.828 --> 00:56:45.287
look like that,
and the r measured from

00:56:45.287 --> 00:56:48.269
any point will look like this.
r cross p,

00:56:48.269 --> 00:56:50.039
which is what I'm calling
L;

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:52.304
the length of L will be
r cross p,

00:56:52.304 --> 00:56:54.484
the lengthy of r cross
p, which will be

00:56:54.484 --> 00:56:55.690
r.
For p,

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:56.910
let me write mv.

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:04.130
v is tangential velocity
here.

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:07.582
But we both know that that is
equal to m times

00:57:07.582 --> 00:57:11.434
ω times r because
the tangential velocity is

00:57:11.434 --> 00:57:14.780
ωr.
That something we did long back.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:19.310
But then this becomes
mω^(2)r.

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:25.059
I'm sorry--mr^(2)ω.
Good.

00:57:25.059 --> 00:57:28.140
And mr^(2) is the moment
of inertia of this point mass,

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:31.070
and ω is the angular
velocity of the point mass.

00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:33.340
That's what we've been using
all this time.

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:36.661
So, it's fully compatible with
the definition of angular

00:57:36.661 --> 00:57:39.619
momentum we had but it's broader
than this one.

00:57:39.619 --> 00:57:42.868
This was applicable only to
bodies which are circling some

00:57:42.868 --> 00:57:45.489
point because they're stuck on a
rigid body.

00:57:45.489 --> 00:57:49.030
That's why this r never
changed and we just went round.

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:51.585
At any instant there is some
ω, it has some angular

00:57:51.585 --> 00:57:54.881
momentum.
But I want you to think about

00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:59.130
the following fact.
Whenever you take a rigid body

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:03.598
that's made up of many bodies,
each one of them has angular

00:58:03.598 --> 00:58:06.880
momentum Iω.
You added them all up.

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.902
But as a vector,
each one has an angular

00:58:08.902 --> 00:58:11.702
momentum coming out of the
blackboard or going into the

00:58:11.702 --> 00:58:13.954
blackboard.
Because if r and

00:58:13.954 --> 00:58:17.478
p lie in the xy
plane, then r cross

00:58:17.478 --> 00:58:21.260
p lies along the z
axis, either out or in.

00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:25.879
That is why both torque and
angular momentum were treated as

00:58:25.879 --> 00:58:29.171
scalars and not as vectors.
Because if a vector is

00:58:29.171 --> 00:58:31.353
constrained to lie up or down
the z axis,

00:58:31.353 --> 00:58:33.489
we can forget about the fact
it's a vector.

00:58:33.489 --> 00:58:36.260
We just say it's plus if it's
up and minus if it's down.

00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:39.210
That's why in all the early
calculations I did today with

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:41.159
torques it was treated as a
scalar,

00:58:41.159 --> 00:58:43.508
but actually the torque was a
vector coming out of the

00:58:43.508 --> 00:58:45.369
blackboard or going into the
blackboard.

00:58:45.369 --> 00:58:48.942
Next, I've shown you that the
angular momentum you get by this

00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:52.514
definition, when applied to a
rigid body -- to a tiny speck on

00:58:52.514 --> 00:58:56.087
a rigid body -- is the same as
the angular momentum we've been

00:58:56.087 --> 00:58:58.505
using.
But now, I want you to think

00:58:58.505 --> 00:59:01.605
about the following notion.
Here is the xy plane

00:59:01.605 --> 00:59:03.988
seen from the top.
There is some body which is

00:59:03.988 --> 00:59:06.349
rotating.
That's the speck on the body,

00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:09.837
for which the angular momentum
written as r cross

00:59:09.837 --> 00:59:13.770
p was Iω.
But the speck now flies off.

00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:19.436
It breaks loose and takes off.
Does it still have angular

00:59:19.436 --> 00:59:21.999
momentum?
If you're doing rigid body

00:59:21.999 --> 00:59:25.751
dynamics, you may not be so sure
whether or not it has angular

00:59:25.751 --> 00:59:27.823
momentum.
Because angular momentum we

00:59:27.823 --> 00:59:30.639
think of as coming from going
round and round something.

00:59:30.639 --> 00:59:32.500
Well, this guy's not going
around anything.

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.413
Right?
Because it is liberated,

00:59:34.413 --> 00:59:37.326
it's taking off like this.
But if you take my definition

00:59:37.326 --> 00:59:40.130
that angular momentum as
r cross p,

00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:44.206
you'll find that it has angular
momentum even when it's here or

00:59:44.206 --> 00:59:46.421
there or anywhere else.
And in fact,

00:59:46.421 --> 00:59:48.040
it has the same angular
momentum.

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.943
I want to tell you why.
When you are here--Let's take

00:59:51.943 --> 00:59:56.039
it that epsilon before it took
off from this rigid body,

00:59:56.039 --> 00:59:58.923
it was still stuck to the rigid
body, and the momentum was in

00:59:58.923 --> 01:00:01.872
this direction;
r was in this direction,

01:00:01.872 --> 01:00:05.724
and the angular momentum was
r times this momentum

01:00:05.724 --> 01:00:08.900
p.
What when it's come here?

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.373
When it's come there,
r is this bigger vector

01:00:11.373 --> 01:00:13.750
r, p is the same
vector p.

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:17.090
It's going at a constant speed.
There are no forces on it.

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:21.297
Has the angular momentum
changed because the r has

01:00:21.297 --> 01:00:24.333
become bigger?
But we don't want just r

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:27.122
times p.
We want r times p

01:00:27.122 --> 01:00:30.127
times sin θ.
But r sin θ is in

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:33.362
fact--I'm sorry,
θ is the angle between

01:00:33.362 --> 01:00:36.573
p and r.
r sin θ is that

01:00:36.573 --> 01:00:39.920
perpendicular distance.
That is not changing.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.291
So, maybe I'll draw a better
figure so you understand what I

01:00:44.291 --> 01:00:47.498
mean.
Take a body in the xy

01:00:47.498 --> 01:00:51.266
plane.
It is just moving like this,

01:00:51.266 --> 01:00:54.990
at constant momentum.
What's its angular momentum,

01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:57.618
is what we are asking.
The easiest time to compute

01:00:57.618 --> 01:00:59.710
angular momentum is when it's
here.

01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:04.484
Then, the angular momentum is
that distance r times the

01:01:04.484 --> 01:01:08.320
momentum p times sine of
90, which is 1.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.162
If you are over here,
then what happens is,

01:01:12.162 --> 01:01:16.280
p is still the same
vector p,

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.403
r looks like a longer
vector, but the θ here,

01:01:19.403 --> 01:01:21.944
if you put it in,
r sin θ is still the

01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:24.468
perpendicular distance.
In other words,

01:01:24.468 --> 01:01:28.820
the angular momentum of a
particle with respect to some

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:33.656
origin is the product of the
momentum times the perpendicular

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:37.525
distance you get by
extrapolating its velocity so

01:01:37.525 --> 01:01:40.909
you can drop a perpendicular on
it.

01:01:40.909 --> 01:01:43.624
Draw a line through the
momentum and drop a

01:01:43.624 --> 01:01:46.079
perpendicular on it from the
origin.

01:01:46.079 --> 01:01:48.307
That distance times its
momentum is the angular

01:01:48.307 --> 01:01:48.840
momentum.

01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:57.149
So, every particle,
unless it's going through the

01:01:57.149 --> 01:02:00.804
center for which I'm finding the
angular momentum,

01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:05.084
will have an angular momentum.
It doesn't have to rotate,

01:02:05.084 --> 01:02:07.767
is the main point.
Even a particle in a straight

01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:10.485
line has angular momentum,
but I'm trying to show you the

01:02:10.485 --> 01:02:12.960
angular momentum here is not
changing with time.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.182
It's not changing because even
as it moves, this component of

01:02:16.182 --> 01:02:19.190
r, the r -per
p, is not changing.

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:22.343
We can see that.
No matter where you are,

01:02:22.343 --> 01:02:26.921
this distance is not changing.
That's the key to the angular

01:02:26.921 --> 01:02:30.219
momentum being a constant.
All right.

01:02:30.219 --> 01:02:33.057
Now, if you've got many many
bodies, you glue them together

01:02:33.057 --> 01:02:36.090
or they have inter-atomic forces
and they form a rigid body;

01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:40.829
then, you can use τ = r
cross F or

01:02:40.829 --> 01:02:45.568
dL_i/dt
--dL_i/dt =

01:02:45.568 --> 01:02:48.826
τ_i.
Angular momentum of body

01:02:48.826 --> 01:02:51.170
i is changing due to the
torque on body i.

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:54.148
You add everything.
Left-hand side will be the

01:02:54.148 --> 01:02:57.070
total rate of change of angular
momentum.

01:02:57.070 --> 01:03:00.739
Right-hand side will be the
total torque.

01:03:00.739 --> 01:03:05.480
Now, the total torque on that
rigid body made up of many point

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:10.220
particles, even if it's not a
rigid body--Just take a bunch of

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:14.572
bodies moving around and find
the rate of change of total

01:03:14.572 --> 01:03:18.032
angular momentum.
That's the sum of the total

01:03:18.032 --> 01:03:20.920
torques.
You can divide the torque into

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:25.192
the external torque and the
torque internally due to the

01:03:25.192 --> 01:03:30.320
forces of one part of the system
on another part of the system.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.579
I'm going in the same way as I
did with momentum.

01:03:34.579 --> 01:03:37.398
The rate of change of total
momentum of a system is the

01:03:37.398 --> 01:03:39.590
external force plus the internal
forces.

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:42.440
You remember the internal
forces cancelled in pairs.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.269
And therefore we could drop
that, and therefore rate of

01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:47.889
change of total momentum was the
external force.

01:03:47.889 --> 01:03:51.139
For torque, you may like to,
again, cancel the internal

01:03:51.139 --> 01:03:54.989
forces -- internal torques --
because the forces are opposite.

01:03:54.989 --> 01:03:58.773
But it's not so obvious you can
cancel them because even though

01:03:58.773 --> 01:04:02.312
the force that I exert on you
and you exert on me are equal

01:04:02.312 --> 01:04:04.505
and opposite,
to find the torque,

01:04:04.505 --> 01:04:07.909
you multiply the force you
exert on me cross product with

01:04:07.909 --> 01:04:10.219
the distance of me from the
origin;

01:04:10.219 --> 01:04:13.420
whereas, with you it's the
distance of you from the origin.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:14.989
So, they don't necessarily
cancel.

01:04:14.989 --> 01:04:18.833
And you can show that only if
the force the one body exerted

01:04:18.833 --> 01:04:21.699
on the other was in the line
joining them;

01:04:21.699 --> 01:04:25.472
then that would cancel and
angular momentum would be

01:04:25.472 --> 01:04:27.704
conserved.
So, angular momentum

01:04:27.704 --> 01:04:31.064
conservation requires more than
just usual momentum

01:04:31.064 --> 01:04:34.061
conservation.
Only for the microscopic level,

01:04:34.061 --> 01:04:37.408
forces that bodies exert on
other bodies is in the line

01:04:37.408 --> 01:04:40.260
joining them is angular momentum
conserved.

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.440
Fortunately,
that turns out to be true for

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.047
every force we know --
gravitation, Coulomb's Law,

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:47.750
electro-static forces.
All of them have the property

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:50.435
that A exerts a force on
B in the line joining

01:04:50.435 --> 01:04:52.961
them.
So, let's take that for granted

01:04:52.961 --> 01:04:56.727
and then do the last problem I
want to do for you guys,

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:58.540
which is the gyroscope.

01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:07.896
So, here is the gyro.
Now, again, I have to draw this

01:05:07.896 --> 01:05:09.840
gyro.
It's another humiliating

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.019
experience.
I'm going to try.

01:05:12.019 --> 01:05:18.909
So, here is a little tower on
which the gyro is supported.

01:05:18.909 --> 01:05:22.400
Now, maybe we can draw it like
this.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:28.970
It's a disk in this case,
which is spinning like that.

01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:33.130
Everybody with me now?
There is a little tower and on

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:36.063
the apex of that you take a
massless rod,

01:05:36.063 --> 01:05:38.409
if you like,
put a gyro here.

01:05:38.409 --> 01:05:41.420
And first of all suppose it's
not spinning.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:47.300
I am going to--I'm holding it
here and I'm going to let it go.

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.020
What's going to happen to the
gyro is what we're asking.

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:54.449
The gyro is not spinning.
Everybody should know.

01:05:54.449 --> 01:05:57.131
You don't need physics 200 or
100 or anything to know what's

01:05:57.131 --> 01:05:59.341
going to happen.
If you let it go it's going to

01:05:59.341 --> 01:06:01.703
fall.
You want to make sure that

01:06:01.703 --> 01:06:06.190
agrees with the equation that we
have, τ = Iα.

01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:10.092
Well, the torque on this gyro
is because the mass of the --

01:06:10.092 --> 01:06:14.061
the rod has no mass -- the disk
which is sitting there has a

01:06:14.061 --> 01:06:16.692
mass mg.
So, torque is equal to

01:06:16.692 --> 01:06:20.379
mg times L where
L is the length of this

01:06:20.379 --> 01:06:23.760
rod.
That will produce an Iα.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:27.010
But let's do the torque as a
vector.

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:32.969
What is the vector torque?
I want you guys to think about

01:06:32.969 --> 01:06:34.760
that.
Here is r.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.970
The vector r looks like
this.

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:38.670
Right?
Horizontal.

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:43.900
The vector mg looks like
this, treated as a vector.

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.375
So, r cross F,
which is really not mgL,

01:06:47.375 --> 01:06:50.969
but r cross F is
a general formula which reduces

01:06:50.969 --> 01:06:53.800
to mgL.
Now, do the screwdriver rule.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.360
From r to mg,
it goes into the board.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:01.336
So, we say the angular momentum
of this rod gets an increment

01:07:01.336 --> 01:07:03.897
pointing into the board.
We should be very,

01:07:03.897 --> 01:07:06.596
very clear that when angular
momentum points into the board

01:07:06.596 --> 01:07:08.690
doesn't mean the gyro goes into
the board.

01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:11.228
It just means the axis around
which the gyro rotates is

01:07:11.228 --> 01:07:14.159
pointing into the board.
It's another way of saying it

01:07:14.159 --> 01:07:17.096
rotates like that.
So, the gyro will pick up an

01:07:17.096 --> 01:07:20.663
α, which we also assign
as going into the board,

01:07:20.663 --> 01:07:24.202
it will just fall down.
So, if you take a gyro and it

01:07:24.202 --> 01:07:28.099
doesn't occur to you to spin the
gyro, you might as well get a

01:07:28.099 --> 01:07:30.909
piece of stick with an orange at
the end.

01:07:30.909 --> 01:07:33.480
What makes a gyro interesting
is the following fact.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.309
You can spin the gyro now.
Now it's a different ballgame.

01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:42.510
Suppose the gyro now has an
initial angular momentum.

01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:45.907
Which way is it pointing?
That's the first thing you've

01:07:45.907 --> 01:07:48.880
got to understand.
This is a spinning disk.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.917
Every part of it is spinning,
and the angular momentum of

01:07:51.917 --> 01:07:55.389
every part -- if you do r
cross P -- will all point

01:07:55.389 --> 01:07:57.542
outside.
So, one way to find the angular

01:07:57.542 --> 01:08:00.594
momentum of the spinning disk is
to have your fingers curl along

01:08:00.594 --> 01:08:03.114
the direction of rotation and
the thumb points in the

01:08:03.114 --> 01:08:06.906
direction of angular momentum.
So, the gyro has an angular

01:08:06.906 --> 01:08:09.780
momentum L pointing that
way.

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:12.340
Let me look at the top view of
this gyro.

01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:13.930
The top view of the gyro is
like this.

01:08:13.930 --> 01:08:16.800
This is the top of the tower.
Here is my gyro.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.252
It is spinning,
as seen from the top,

01:08:19.252 --> 01:08:21.250
like this.
And it's got an angular

01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:23.150
momentum L in this
direction.

01:08:27.689 --> 01:08:29.489
Okay, this is a pretty dicey
thing.

01:08:29.489 --> 01:08:31.020
So, you may have to go home and
read it again.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:32.869
I don't know how much I can do
right now.

01:08:32.869 --> 01:08:37.451
But now let us look at the
impact of the gravitational

01:08:37.451 --> 01:08:40.249
torque.
The angular momentum change

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:44.737
ΔL is equal to τ
times the time Δt we

01:08:44.737 --> 01:08:47.729
agreed was going into the
blackboard.

01:08:47.729 --> 01:08:51.481
That means this L is
getting a little contribution

01:08:51.481 --> 01:08:55.435
ΔL in that direction and
that just means the gyro is

01:08:55.435 --> 01:08:59.218
going to come to that location.
So, what happens is,

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:03.103
if you have an L to
begin with, you act with the

01:09:03.103 --> 01:09:06.834
ΔL like this,
you get the new L +

01:09:06.834 --> 01:09:10.380
ΔL, which is just a
rotated L.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:14.960
That's why the gyro doesn't
fall.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.067
See, for a static rod,
got an angular momentum going

01:09:19.067 --> 01:09:22.529
into the board,
it really means it's falling

01:09:22.529 --> 01:09:25.810
down like this.
But if a rotating gyro got an

01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:29.250
angular momentum on top of an
existing angular momentum,

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:31.897
then the new angular momentum
is now just a rotated angular

01:09:31.897 --> 01:09:34.138
momentum.
So, when seen from the top,

01:09:34.138 --> 01:09:37.550
the gyro will be doing what's
called a "precession."

01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:40.369
If you support it,
it will just slowly go round

01:09:40.369 --> 01:09:45.179
and round with this tip here.
Now, does this remind you of

01:09:45.179 --> 01:09:49.439
anything you have seen before?
Yeah?

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:51.314
Student:
The Earth rotating around the

01:09:51.314 --> 01:09:51.989
Sun.
Professor Ramamurti

01:09:51.989 --> 01:09:53.466
Shankar: Right.
When we did the Earth rotating

01:09:53.466 --> 01:09:55.075
around the Sun or any satellite
going around,

01:09:55.075 --> 01:09:57.930
it was the same thing.
Here is an apple.

01:09:57.930 --> 01:10:00.664
If it's not moving,
the force of gravity acts on

01:10:00.664 --> 01:10:03.399
it, causes an acceleration
toward the center.

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:06.653
That means what you and I think
it means, falling toward the

01:10:06.653 --> 01:10:08.992
center.
But if you take an apple with a

01:10:08.992 --> 01:10:12.142
huge velocity to begin with,
add to it an acceleration

01:10:12.142 --> 01:10:15.471
toward the center or a tiny
increment of velocity in this

01:10:15.471 --> 01:10:19.037
direction -- we will just give
it that velocity -- and that's

01:10:19.037 --> 01:10:21.950
the velocity it has when it has
come here.

01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:25.698
Same thing with the gyro.
The gyro does get the same

01:10:25.698 --> 01:10:29.939
angular momentum ΔL that
it would whether or not it was

01:10:29.939 --> 01:10:31.636
rotating.
But in one case,

01:10:31.636 --> 01:10:34.760
you add it to zero and conclude
it's going to fall down;

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.854
in the other case,
you add it to L and

01:10:36.854 --> 01:10:39.673
conclude that it will rotate.
So, the gyro is constantly

01:10:39.673 --> 01:10:42.000
trying to fall down but it's
chasing itself.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.416
Just like this is constantly
trying to fall down and chasing

01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:48.300
itself.
So, the last thing I wanted to

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.560
calculate is the rate at which
it goes round and round.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.529
That's a pretty easy
calculation.

01:10:52.529 --> 01:10:54.960
I will do that and I will let
you go.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.130
So, let's ask the following
question.

01:10:57.130 --> 01:11:01.369
Here is the gyro whose angular
momentum was L.

01:11:01.369 --> 01:11:04.810
A little later L + ΔL
looks like that.

01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:09.622
This is ΔL.
And it rotates in angle

01:11:09.622 --> 01:11:14.420
Δθ in some time
Δt.

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:17.751
Then, just from the radians
business you have learned,

01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:21.146
I think you guys know that
ΔL is L times

01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:23.850
Δθ if θ is in
radians.

01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:26.930
That's why I'm cautioning you
to always think in radians.

01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:30.334
So, if you rotate the vector by
an angle Δθ,

01:11:30.334 --> 01:11:34.000
that segment for small inner
segments is LΔθ.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.340
So, divide both sides by the
time over which it happens.

01:11:40.569 --> 01:11:44.398
ΔL/Δt on the left-hand
side is the torque,

01:11:44.398 --> 01:11:48.686
and this is L times
what's called the precessional

01:11:48.686 --> 01:11:51.520
frequency,
ω_P.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.869
That's what we are trying to
calculate.

01:11:53.869 --> 01:11:59.188
So, the precessional frequency
in this problem is equal to the

01:11:59.188 --> 01:12:03.460
torque divided by angular
momentum of the gyro.

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:08.224
The torque, and now we can put
the numbers in,

01:12:08.224 --> 01:12:13.242
is mg times L.
The angular momentum of the

01:12:13.242 --> 01:12:16.314
gyro is some ½ Iω
squared--I'm sorry,

01:12:16.314 --> 01:12:17.270
Iω.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.241
Okay, so this
is--Unfortunately,

01:12:28.241 --> 01:12:31.350
we don't have the ability to
demonstrate anything in this

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:33.986
room.
But if you looked at the stuff

01:12:33.986 --> 01:12:37.831
we have in Sloane [Physics
building], if you take a big

01:12:37.831 --> 01:12:40.904
gyro and you spin it,
you suspend one end on the tip

01:12:40.904 --> 01:12:43.362
of a tower and it's spinning
like this, you attach some

01:12:43.362 --> 01:12:45.618
weight to it,
you will find it starts going

01:12:45.618 --> 01:12:47.870
around.
If the gyro is not spinning,

01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:50.228
it will just fall down.
If it's spinning,

01:12:50.228 --> 01:12:52.963
it's got angular momentum in
that direction to which it gets

01:12:52.963 --> 01:12:56.949
an increment in that direction.
So, it goes on rotating.

01:12:56.949 --> 01:12:59.485
And if you add more weights to
the gyro, it will rotate faster

01:12:59.485 --> 01:13:02.103
because if you add more weights
to the gyro besides its own mass

01:13:02.103 --> 01:13:03.600
you will increase this quantity.

01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:10.276
All right.
So, we are done with the nasty

01:13:10.276 --> 01:13:12.308
part.
So, next week we start

01:13:12.308 --> 01:13:17.000
relativity so that you guys can
get something more contemporary.

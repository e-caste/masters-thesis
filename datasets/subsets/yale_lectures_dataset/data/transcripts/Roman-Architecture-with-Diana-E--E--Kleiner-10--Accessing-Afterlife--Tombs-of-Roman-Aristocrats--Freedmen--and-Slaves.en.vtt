00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.980
Prof: Good morning
everyone.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.490
We are on the cusp of
Valentine's Day.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.321
So I thought it was appropriate
for us all to tell Rome how much

00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:14.850
we love--Rome or Roma--how much
we love her.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.810
And so I've done that here.
 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.490
I've loved Rome for as long
as--for a long time,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.780
certainly from the age that you
are now.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.840
And I know that there are many
of you in this class who feel

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.583
the same way,
and I hope that those of you

00:00:28.583 --> 00:00:31.083
who entered this class,
without having those strong

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:34.955
feelings for Rome,
have come to love the city and

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:37.930
its civilization as much as I
do.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.070
So this is a kind of Valentine
lecture, for Rome.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.490
And I think that the particular
topic that it is,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.610
is appropriate,
in the sense that we are going

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.980
to be looking at a number of
quite eclectic monuments today,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.180
very different monuments,
one from the next,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360
and they're full of surprises.
 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.400
And Rome is always full of
surprises;

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.146
Rome a city,
of course, that you see layers

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:05.489
upon layer of civilization,
that one peels back to get us

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.299
back to antiquity,
but along the way experiences

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.870
some amazing things.
 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.900
So I think that this particular
lecture,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.450
which will talk about the
varied nature of Roman

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.104
architecture,
especially architecture

00:01:18.104 --> 00:01:22.602
commissioned by individual
patrons to preserve their memory

00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:24.876
for posterity,
again is particularly

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:25.420
appropriate.
 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.944
I've called today's lecture
"Accessing Afterlife:

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:34.810
Tombs of Roman Aristocrats,
Freedmen, and Slaves."

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.730
We spoke on Tuesday about
public architecture commissioned

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.031
by the emperor Augustus,
public architecture that we

00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:50.099
noted was made primarily out of
marble,

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.206
out of Luna or Carrara marble,
that was quarried on the

00:01:54.206 --> 00:01:59.456
northwest coast of Italy itself,
and the objective of it being

00:01:59.456 --> 00:02:04.096
to try to conjure up the
relationship between the new

00:02:04.096 --> 00:02:08.199
Golden Age of Augustus and the
Golden Age,

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.370
fifth century B.C.,
of Periclean Athens.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.769
Just as Julius Caesar had tried
to create a kind of Alexandria

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.133
on the Tiber,
we see Augustus trying to

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:23.318
recreate an Athens on the Tiber.
 

00:02:23.318 --> 00:02:25.270
And Augustus was,
of course, very much--

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.045
in his objectives was very much
in keeping with other objectives

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:32.643
that we've been studying for
some time: this Hellenization of

00:02:32.643 --> 00:02:35.940
Roman architecture that we have
addressed on a number of

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.900
occasions.
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.840
We spoke last time about the
Forum of Augustus in Rome,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.098
featuring the Temple of Mars
Ultor,

00:02:44.098 --> 00:02:48.473
that temple that Augustus vowed
he would build if he could be

00:02:48.473 --> 00:02:52.120
victorious over the assassins of
Julius Caesar,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.008
that is, Cassius and Brutus.
 

00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:57.708
He was so, at the Battle of
Philippi, and he built this

00:02:57.708 --> 00:03:01.680
forum and he built this temple
again as its centerpiece.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.889
And you'll recall again that it
was made, for the most part,

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.008
out of Carrara marble.
 

00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:11.614
We see the columns of Carrara
here, a wall,

00:03:11.614 --> 00:03:14.590
the seventeen Carrara marble
steps, and so on.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.270
We also talked about the Ara
Pacis Augustae,

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.352
the Altar of Augustan Peace,
put up to the diplomatic

00:03:22.352 --> 00:03:27.628
agreements or treaties that
Augustus made with those in

00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:32.125
Spain and Gaul:
a monument that was put up near

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:37.377
his earlier mausoleum,
a monument that was also made

00:03:37.377 --> 00:03:41.084
out of Carrara marble,
and in fact solid Carrara

00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:41.628
marble.
 

00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:46.300
And this monument too had
precedents in the Greek period.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.990
It looked back to a number of
sources,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.590
but one of those,
as we noted on Tuesday,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.060
was the Altar of the Twelve
Gods, or the Altar of Pity,

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.080
a fifth-century B.C.
 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.050
monument that was located in
the marketplace of ancient

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.878
Greece.
 

00:04:01.878 --> 00:04:04.949
So again, both of these
buildings, looking back to Greek

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.068
prototypes in their general
format,

00:04:07.068 --> 00:04:10.080
and also, of course,
in the material out of which

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.628
they were made,
namely marble.

00:04:12.628 --> 00:04:15.250
When we talked about the Ara
Pacis,

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.096
we talked about the fact that
it eventually ended up being

00:04:19.096 --> 00:04:22.000
part of a kind of architectural
complex,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.334
that while this architectural
complex may have not been

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:28.502
planned from the start,
it grew up over time into

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:32.129
something where all of the
buildings related to one another

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.475
in interesting ways,
both in terms of their content

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:38.490
and also in terms of their
architectural design.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.470
The complex included the
Mausoleum of Augustus,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.401
the tomb of the emperor
Augustus, which was the first

00:04:46.401 --> 00:04:49.954
monument built on this site,
and eventually the Ara Pacis,

00:04:49.954 --> 00:04:53.317
which you'll recall was
actually not located originally

00:04:53.317 --> 00:04:54.500
where it is now.
 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.041
It was located in an area a bit
here to the upper right

00:04:58.041 --> 00:05:00.613
originally,
on the Via Flaminia that

00:05:00.613 --> 00:05:04.819
Augustus took when he returned
to Rome from Spain and Gaul,

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.925
but that it was moved,
or the remains of it were moved

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:10.495
over to this location,
next to the Tiber,

00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:13.319
by Mussolini,
because as we noted last time,

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.507
in the meantime a palace had
been built on top of the

00:05:17.507 --> 00:05:20.569
original location of the Ara
Pacis,

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.389
and that area was no longer
available for use.

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.790
But again, the Mausoleum of
Augustus, the first building of

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.670
this complex.
 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.910
You see in this aerial view
from Google Earth that the

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.389
mausoleum ended up becoming the
centerpiece of the Piazza

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.562
Augusto Imperatore,
that piazza that Mussolini's

00:05:41.562 --> 00:05:45.906
architects designed to
commemorate Augustus and also to

00:05:45.906 --> 00:05:49.802
commemorate Mussolini,
because that inscription I

00:05:49.802 --> 00:05:54.100
showed you last time is inserted
into the building over here.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.310
If we look at this aerial view
of the Mausoleum of Augustus,

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.098
which you'll see from your
Monument List was begun in 28

00:06:01.098 --> 00:06:03.504
B.C.--
and in fact that should ring

00:06:03.504 --> 00:06:07.677
some bells for you and we should
say something about its genesis

00:06:07.677 --> 00:06:08.540
in 28 B.C.
 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.250
Because you'll recall that
important date of 31;

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.363
31 the Battle of Actium when
Augustus was victorious over

00:06:15.363 --> 00:06:18.889
Antony and Cleopatra and became
sole emperor,

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:24.199
or began his march to becoming
sole emperor of the Roman world.

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.605
It's interesting to see him
building this massive mausoleum

00:06:28.605 --> 00:06:32.100
only three years after the
Battle of Actium;

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.480
that's really quite striking.
 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.329
Why did he do that?
 

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:39.288
Well the reason that he seems
to have done that is despite the

00:06:39.288 --> 00:06:41.949
fact that he lived until
76-years-old,

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:44.800
which was very old in ancient
Roman times,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.622
as I mentioned last
time--despite the fact that he

00:06:47.622 --> 00:06:50.910
lived to that ripe old age,
he was not in terribly good

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.827
health,
even as a young man,

00:06:52.827 --> 00:06:56.389
and he was very concerned about
his own longevity.

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:57.560
How long was he going to live?
 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.362
He knew he had accomplished a
lot already by this victory over

00:07:01.362 --> 00:07:03.937
Antony and Cleopatra,
and by some of his other

00:07:03.937 --> 00:07:06.430
military victories,
but he wasn't actually sure how

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.307
long he was going to last,
and so he begins to build this

00:07:10.307 --> 00:07:14.439
gigantic tomb eventually to hold
his own remains.

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:16.860
And he completes that tomb in
five years.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.870
It's built between 28 B.C.
 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.649
and 23 B.C.
 

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:23.812
And you'll recall the date of
the Ara Pacis is considerably

00:07:23.812 --> 00:07:28.028
later;
13 to 9 B.C.

00:07:28.028 --> 00:07:29.730
So the Ara Pacis was only added
to this complex later,

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.437
and at that point the whole
thing was orchestrated with the

00:07:32.437 --> 00:07:35.404
addition of the obelisk,
and we talked about how the

00:07:35.404 --> 00:07:39.379
obelisk cast a shadow on the Ara
Pacis on Augustus' birthday,

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:41.509
and so on and so forth.
 

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:44.502
With regard to the tomb itself,
we're going to see something

00:07:44.502 --> 00:07:47.956
quite striking today,
and that is that the tomb is

00:07:47.956 --> 00:07:52.829
architecturally very different
from the Ara Pacis Augustae,

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:56.100
and indeed from the Forum of
Augustus.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.841
And it's a good example of the
eccentricity,

00:07:58.841 --> 00:08:02.475
as we'll characterize today,
of Roman tomb architecture in

00:08:02.475 --> 00:08:03.240
general.
 

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.247
Keep in mind that Roman tomb
architecture is the most

00:08:06.247 --> 00:08:08.910
personal of any form of Roman
architecture,

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.360
which makes it particularly
interesting to study,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.382
because the only practical
requirement for a tomb was that

00:08:15.382 --> 00:08:18.839
it be able to hold the remains
of the deceased.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:21.379
That's all it needed to do,
whereas other buildings had to

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:23.829
do all kinds of other things:
have running water through

00:08:23.829 --> 00:08:25.300
them, and so on and so forth.
 

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.028
But that was not the case here.
 

00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:31.461
So that the patron and the
architect could come together to

00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:35.663
create buildings that were
unique to that individual and

00:08:35.663 --> 00:08:39.178
again were eccentric to a
certain degree,

00:08:39.178 --> 00:08:41.460
and that is indeed what we will
see,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.538
and that is the case also in
the Mausoleum of Augustus.

00:08:45.538 --> 00:08:48.855
As we look down on the
Mausoleum of Augustus,

00:08:48.855 --> 00:08:52.850
in this aerial view,
we see the general plan of it.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.860
We see that there was a central
burial chamber;

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.389
that there was a hollow drum,
and around that hollow drum--

00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:01.678
and all of this is made of
concrete construction--

00:09:01.678 --> 00:09:05.820
around that hollow drum a
series of concentric rings,

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.750
a series of concentric rings,
as you can see them here,

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.759
again made out of concrete.
 

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:16.398
And then the outer wall--which
you can also see in this

00:09:16.398 --> 00:09:19.498
view--the outer wall was faced
with travertine,

00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:23.534
which is also interesting;
not Luna marble,

00:09:23.534 --> 00:09:25.928
travertine blocks.
 

00:09:25.928 --> 00:09:29.322
And let me show you another
somewhat closer view,

00:09:29.322 --> 00:09:33.000
also from Google Earth,
to show you the structure.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.879
So again the central burial
chamber;

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:37.903
the hollow drum;
the concentric rings around

00:09:37.903 --> 00:09:41.918
that;
the travertine wall around that.

00:09:41.918 --> 00:09:44.038
But, of course,
you're looking essentially at

00:09:44.038 --> 00:09:44.570
the core.
 

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.558
This is not what the original
entire monument looked like.

00:09:48.558 --> 00:09:52.153
And what it was,
was in fact there was an

00:09:52.153 --> 00:09:56.095
earthen tumulus,
or an earthen mound,

00:09:56.095 --> 00:10:00.190
that was placed on top of these
concentric rings,

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.287
and then at the very apex of
that earthen mound was a

00:10:04.287 --> 00:10:08.778
gleaming bronze statue of the
emperor Augustus himself.

00:10:08.778 --> 00:10:13.534
I think I can make this clearer
by showing you a plan of the

00:10:13.534 --> 00:10:15.470
Mausoleum of Augustus.
 

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.606
And we see all the features
I've already described:

00:10:18.606 --> 00:10:21.423
the central burial chamber,
the hollow drum,

00:10:21.423 --> 00:10:24.110
again all made out of concrete
construction,

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.418
and the concentric rings around
that.

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:30.849
And then the cross-section at
the top is particularly helpful

00:10:30.849 --> 00:10:34.279
I think because you can see the
way in which the concrete has

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:37.480
been built up by means obviously
of annular vaults,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.292
the annular vaults that
ultimately support the gleaming

00:10:41.292 --> 00:10:44.490
bronze statue of Augustus,
at the apex.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.600
And you can also see in this
cross-section the earthen mound,

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.659
the way in which the earthen
mound is piled up on top of that

00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:57.753
substructure,
that concrete substructure,

00:10:57.753 --> 00:11:03.750
to create the dome-like shape
of the mausoleum on its own.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.393
Now scholars who believe--and
we all believe in fact--that

00:11:08.393 --> 00:11:12.139
again Augustus was a
philhellene, that he had a

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:15.480
particular penchant for things
Greek.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.052
So you look at something like
this and you ask yourselves,

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:19.769
"Well, what's Greek about
this?

00:11:19.769 --> 00:11:22.447
Why didn't he,
when he came to make the

00:11:22.447 --> 00:11:26.888
decision about his last resting
place, why did he not want to be

00:11:26.888 --> 00:11:30.058
laid to rest in the manner of
the Greeks?

00:11:30.058 --> 00:11:32.918
Why doesn't this--why wasn't
this tomb made in the form,

00:11:32.918 --> 00:11:34.476
for example,
of a Greek temple,

00:11:34.476 --> 00:11:35.879
or something like that?
 

00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:37.970
Why did he choose this
particular form?"

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.493
So scholars have debated for
quite some time whether there

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:43.779
are any tombs like this in
Greece,

00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:50.143
or in Asia Minor--what kind of
tomb was Alexander the Great

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:52.700
buried in,
for example?

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.543
Well we don't know exactly for
sure, but that's one

00:11:55.543 --> 00:11:59.128
possibility, that it might have
something to do with Alexander's

00:11:59.128 --> 00:11:59.639
tomb.
 

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:03.548
Others--because Aeneas came
from burning Troy--

00:12:03.548 --> 00:12:06.201
others have suggested
perhaps--and that's in Asia

00:12:06.201 --> 00:12:08.505
Minor--
perhaps the way the Trojans

00:12:08.505 --> 00:12:12.519
were buried might have something
to do with this selection.

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:16.129
But I think the model is much
closer at hand.

00:12:16.129 --> 00:12:19.586
I think the model--myself,
I believe that the model comes

00:12:19.586 --> 00:12:22.159
from Italy,
and that it's a very

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:26.009
interesting choice on the part
of Augustus,

00:12:26.009 --> 00:12:28.751
because I think what it tells
us is that Augustus may have

00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:31.831
wanted to build public buildings
in Rome that conjured up ancient

00:12:31.831 --> 00:12:34.129
Athens,
but when it came to deciding

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:36.279
about how he wanted to be
buried,

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:42.009
he wanted to be buried in the
manner of his Italian ancestors.

00:12:42.009 --> 00:12:44.798
Let me show you what I think is
a really important comparison.

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:47.870
We're looking on the left-hand
side of the screen once again at

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.200
the Mausoleum of Augustus,
as it looks today.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.990
Here you see the central
entranceway.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:57.870
You see what remains of the
concentric, concrete rings.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:05.527
You see some of the travertine
facing for the outer ring of the

00:13:05.527 --> 00:13:07.009
structure.
 

00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:08.653
And you see,
of course, that the uppermost

00:13:08.653 --> 00:13:10.778
part, namely the earthen mound,
is no longer there.

00:13:10.778 --> 00:13:13.600
But if I compare the Mausoleum
of Augustus,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.580
to what you see here on the
right-hand side of the screen,

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.389
which is an Etruscan tomb,
an Etruscan tomb from the

00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:22.418
so-called--
and I put this on the Monument

00:13:22.418 --> 00:13:25.544
List for you--
the Banditaccia Cemetery,

00:13:25.544 --> 00:13:29.490
which is at a site called
Cerveteri,

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.759
Cerveteri, a very important
Etruscan site.

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:41.029
And this tomb we believe dates
to the sixth century B.C.

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:44.126
Cerveteri is an extraordinary
place to visit now because there

00:13:44.126 --> 00:13:46.210
is one tomb after another of
this type.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.111
You go into the site and you
feel like you're on another

00:13:50.111 --> 00:13:53.303
planet or some such,
as you wander among these

00:13:53.303 --> 00:13:56.710
extremely well-preserved tombs
at Cerveteri.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.176
And Cerveteri,
by the way, is right off the

00:13:59.176 --> 00:14:01.350
highway, between Rome and
Florence.

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.548
So it's a very easy site to get
to and very well worthwhile;

00:14:05.548 --> 00:14:07.875
there's nothing quite like it
anywhere in Italy,

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:09.408
anywhere indeed in the world.
 

00:14:09.408 --> 00:14:13.375
And you see these series--and
I've just chosen one here to

00:14:13.375 --> 00:14:15.879
show you--
you see these series of tombs,

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:19.051
and I think if you look at it
you'll see the similarity of

00:14:19.051 --> 00:14:21.110
this to the Mausoleum of
Augustus.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:27.038
These round Etruscan tombs have
central burial chambers.

00:14:27.038 --> 00:14:31.613
They have stone facing around
the outermost part of the

00:14:31.613 --> 00:14:32.629
structure.
 

00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:36.884
And you can see that piled on
top of that is an earthen mound,

00:14:36.884 --> 00:14:40.721
and if you expand the size --
the Cerveteri tomb is much

00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:41.558
smaller.
 

00:14:41.558 --> 00:14:45.057
Actually the individual
Cerveteri tombs are smaller than

00:14:45.057 --> 00:14:46.840
the Mausoleum of Augustus.
 

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.759
The Mausoleum of Augustus is
290 feet in diameter;

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:51.149
it's a very large building.
 

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:54.480
But if you expand the size of
one of these,

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.470
what we call tumulus,
t-u-m-u-l-u-s,

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.730
tumulus tombs,
at Cerveteri,

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.950
if you expand the size,
if you plant this with trees--

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.953
because we know that the
Mausoleum of Augustus was

00:15:05.953 --> 00:15:08.528
planted with trees on the
earthen mound;

00:15:08.528 --> 00:15:11.143
there's been quite a bit of
controversy about what kind of

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:11.509
trees.
 

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:13.440
For a long time people said
cypress trees.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.750
Now people seem to favor
juniper trees.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.745
But whatever,
trees of some sort,

00:15:17.745 --> 00:15:19.740
decorating that earthen mound.
 

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:24.077
So if you enlarge this,
if you put some junipers on top

00:15:24.077 --> 00:15:26.561
of it,
and if you stick a gleaming

00:15:26.561 --> 00:15:29.168
bronze statue of Augustus at the
apex,

00:15:29.168 --> 00:15:35.009
you will have essentially the
Mausoleum of Augustus.

00:15:35.009 --> 00:15:37.327
So I'd like to suggest to you
today that the Mausoleum of

00:15:37.327 --> 00:15:39.730
Augustus indicates to us that
when it came to his tomb,

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.379
Augustus wanted to be buried
like his Italian ancestors,

00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:48.267
like the Etruscans,
and that is why he chose this

00:15:48.267 --> 00:15:51.730
particular type of tomb in Rome.
 

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.533
The Mausoleum of Augustus,
like so many other monuments

00:15:54.533 --> 00:15:56.820
that we've been looking at this
semester,

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.658
survives in large part because
it was re-used over the

00:16:00.658 --> 00:16:03.408
centuries in a wide variety of
ways.

00:16:03.408 --> 00:16:07.471
You can see in this engraving
that it was used at one point as

00:16:07.471 --> 00:16:10.504
a garden,
a very nicely manicured garden,

00:16:10.504 --> 00:16:13.100
as you can see inside the
remains,

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.720
inside those concentric
circles, a very nice garden.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.436
It was also used as a fortress
at one point by the well-known

00:16:21.436 --> 00:16:23.480
Colonna family of Italy.
 

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.205
It was used,
believe it or not,

00:16:25.205 --> 00:16:28.254
as a bull ring--
a little touch of Spain in the

00:16:28.254 --> 00:16:31.903
midst of Rome,
as a bull ring--and it was used

00:16:31.903 --> 00:16:34.480
most recently as a music hall.
 

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.668
It was a music hall before it
was turned back into the

00:16:39.668 --> 00:16:42.019
Mausoleum of Augustus.
 

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:45.535
So again, this very--a very
similar saga to this building

00:16:45.535 --> 00:16:49.491
and to its post-antique history,
as to so many others that we've

00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:50.558
talked about.
 

00:16:50.558 --> 00:16:54.950
Another important point to make
about the Mausoleum of Augustus

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.254
is that,
although Augustus intended it

00:16:58.254 --> 00:17:02.499
as his own last resting place,
he didn't intend for him to be

00:17:02.499 --> 00:17:04.640
the only person who was laid to
rest there.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.890
He wanted this to serve as a
family tomb,

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.097
for him, his wife,
his--well it turned out his

00:17:10.097 --> 00:17:13.509
daughter didn't end up there,
but that may have been the

00:17:13.509 --> 00:17:15.660
intention originally,
that she would.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.238
She was discredited because of
all the adulterous affairs she

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:22.338
had and Augustus eventually
banished her in 2 B.C.

00:17:22.338 --> 00:17:25.310
from Rome, razed her house to
the ground, and did not allow

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.769
her to be buried in the
Mausoleum of Augustus.

00:17:27.769 --> 00:17:33.769
But for his wife,
for his nephew and son-in-law,

00:17:33.769 --> 00:17:37.169
Marcellus, and others,
he wanted to create this family

00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:39.939
tomb where he,
his family, and presumably,

00:17:39.939 --> 00:17:42.798
since his objective was to
create a dynasty,

00:17:42.798 --> 00:17:46.371
presumably where his successors
of the dynasty that he founded

00:17:46.371 --> 00:17:48.068
would also be laid to rest.
 

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:51.680
And there are inscription
plaques that have come to light,

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.284
from the Mausoleum of Augustus,
and I can show you a couple of

00:17:54.284 --> 00:17:57.316
them here,
that do indicate that was

00:17:57.316 --> 00:17:59.098
exactly the case.
 

00:17:59.098 --> 00:18:02.512
We see this plaque over here,
which actually has the name

00:18:02.512 --> 00:18:04.220
Marcellus inscribed there.
 

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.800
This is the Marcellus of the
Theater of Marcellus,

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.040
the nephew and son-in-law of
Augustus, who was laid to rest

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.650
in this Mausoleum.
 

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:18.259
His sister, "soror,"
Octavia, also laid to rest;

00:18:18.259 --> 00:18:21.335
that is, Augustus' sister,
Octavia, also laid to rest

00:18:21.335 --> 00:18:21.750
here.
 

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.777
And it continued to be used as
a burial place again after

00:18:25.777 --> 00:18:29.732
Augustus' death and through the
so-called Julio-Claudian

00:18:29.732 --> 00:18:32.484
emperors,
who we'll look at next week:

00:18:32.484 --> 00:18:34.730
Tiberius and Caligula and
Claudius.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.846
And we see, in fact,
an inscription plaque over here

00:18:37.846 --> 00:18:41.269
that honors Agrippina the Elder:
Agrippina the Elder,

00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:44.250
the mother of Caligula,
the third emperor of Rome,

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.798
and it was Caligula who laid
his mother to rest in this tomb.

00:18:47.798 --> 00:18:53.190
So very much a family tomb
created by the emperor Augustus.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.246
And I should also mention,
with regard to burial practice

00:18:56.246 --> 00:18:59.440
at this time,
that everybody was--imperial

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.061
individuals,
and those lower on the social

00:19:02.061 --> 00:19:04.970
pyramid as well--
were all cremated at this

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.328
particular time.
 

00:19:06.328 --> 00:19:10.750
So you have to imagine that
there were urns for each of

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.190
these inside the tomb somewhere
as well.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:18.515
Now it may not surprise you to
hear that once the emperor chose

00:19:18.515 --> 00:19:22.396
the form of his tomb,
that he set in motion a fashion

00:19:22.396 --> 00:19:26.028
that just about every aristocrat
wanted to follow.

00:19:26.028 --> 00:19:28.586
So all of a sudden,
after the construction of the

00:19:28.586 --> 00:19:31.769
Mausoleum of Augustus,
again between 28 and 23,

00:19:31.769 --> 00:19:35.854
there is this efflorescence of
round tombs in Rome and

00:19:35.854 --> 00:19:37.548
elsewhere in Italy.
 

00:19:37.548 --> 00:19:40.410
And I want to show you just one
example of that.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.410
This is the so-called Tomb of
Caecilia Metella.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.930
It dates to 20 B.C.
 

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.913
So it began to be put up not
too long after Augustus'

00:19:50.913 --> 00:19:52.598
mausoleum was built.
 

00:19:52.598 --> 00:19:56.503
It is located on the famous Via
Appia in Rome,

00:19:56.503 --> 00:19:57.980
the Appian Way.
 

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.828
The Appian Way,
which you see--this is a Google

00:20:00.828 --> 00:20:04.731
Earth image once again where you
can see a stretch of the Appian

00:20:04.731 --> 00:20:06.924
Way,
or the Via Appia,

00:20:06.924 --> 00:20:11.038
that is modern asphalt,
although there are remains--and

00:20:11.038 --> 00:20:13.298
I'll show you later an example
of this--

00:20:13.298 --> 00:20:17.901
there are remains of the
polygonal masonry pavement that

00:20:17.901 --> 00:20:22.238
would have been there initially,
looking very much like the

00:20:22.238 --> 00:20:25.328
pavement that we saw in Pompeii,
for example.

00:20:25.328 --> 00:20:28.817
And you can see the Tomb of
Caecilia Metella right over

00:20:28.817 --> 00:20:29.269
here.
 

00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:32.705
Like the Mausoleum of Augustus,
it was re-used in ancient

00:20:32.705 --> 00:20:36.450
times, and there was a fortress
and a palace that was added to

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:36.880
it.
 

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.170
And you can see also there,
in a reddish earth color,

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:47.025
the remains of that fortress
and palace that abutted the

00:20:47.025 --> 00:20:51.710
mausoleum or the Tomb of
Caecilia Metella.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.183
And while this is on the
screen, you can also see that

00:20:55.183 --> 00:20:58.660
while the tomb was essentially a
cylindrical drum,

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.788
resembling the cylindrical drum
of the Mausoleum of Augustus,

00:21:02.788 --> 00:21:06.722
it was placed--it was given
some height by being placed on a

00:21:06.722 --> 00:21:09.248
podium--
the kind of podium that we saw

00:21:09.248 --> 00:21:11.973
at the sanctuaries,
or the podium that we saw at

00:21:11.973 --> 00:21:14.450
the Villa of the Mysteries--
to raise it up.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.630
It's not as big as those,
but it's sizable,

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.880
and it raises this round tomb
up a little bit,

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.462
so that it can be more readily
seen as people make their way

00:21:23.462 --> 00:21:24.798
along the Via Appia.
 

00:21:24.798 --> 00:21:28.460
The Mausoleum of Augustus does
not have a similar podium.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.236
So that's a unique,
a different feature that is

00:21:31.236 --> 00:21:33.470
added to this particular
structure.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.153
You can also see there's an
inscription on the front,

00:21:36.153 --> 00:21:39.042
and we'll talk about that in a
moment, and then there are

00:21:39.042 --> 00:21:40.538
crenellations at the top.
 

00:21:40.538 --> 00:21:43.525
There's some dispute about when
those crenellations were added,

00:21:43.525 --> 00:21:46.029
whether they belonged to the
original tomb or not.

00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:48.663
I think it's highly unlikely
that they belonged to the

00:21:48.663 --> 00:21:51.285
original tomb,
and they may have been added at

00:21:51.285 --> 00:21:53.920
the time that this was made into
a fortress,

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.088
as I've already mentioned.
 

00:21:57.088 --> 00:21:59.650
This is a view of the Tomb of
Caecilia Metella,

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:04.401
as it looks today,
this tomb of this woman of 20

00:22:04.401 --> 00:22:06.673
B.C.,
and you can see that it's

00:22:06.673 --> 00:22:10.096
actually quite well preserved,
and we can get a very good

00:22:10.096 --> 00:22:12.118
sense of its original
appearance.

00:22:12.118 --> 00:22:16.406
You can see the concrete podium
down here, without its original

00:22:16.406 --> 00:22:18.788
facing;
it was surely faced.

00:22:18.788 --> 00:22:21.270
You can see the great
cylindrical drum,

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.601
of the Tomb of Caecilia
Metella, and you can see the

00:22:24.601 --> 00:22:25.318
facing.
 

00:22:25.318 --> 00:22:27.923
And, once again,
the facing for this tomb,

00:22:27.923 --> 00:22:31.671
just as in the Mausoleum of
Augustus, is not Luna or Carrara

00:22:31.671 --> 00:22:32.368
marble.
 

00:22:32.368 --> 00:22:35.547
It is travertine,
but very, very nicely cut

00:22:35.547 --> 00:22:38.650
travertine blocks,
as you can see here.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:39.990
Very well done.
 

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.465
She was undoubtedly a
well-to-do patron who was able

00:22:43.465 --> 00:22:46.893
to hire the best architects,
the best artisans,

00:22:46.893 --> 00:22:50.688
and they have done an
outstanding job of cutting that

00:22:50.688 --> 00:22:51.710
travertine.
 

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:56.257
You can see also that there is
a frieze that encircles the

00:22:56.257 --> 00:23:01.575
monument at the uppermost part,
right here, and that frieze

00:23:01.575 --> 00:23:05.339
depicts garlands and skulls of
bulls,

00:23:05.339 --> 00:23:08.339
bucrania;
the same sort of thing that we

00:23:08.339 --> 00:23:10.970
saw in the inner precinct wall
of the Ara Pacis.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:14.582
Although this pre-dates the Ara
Pacis, so we can't say it was

00:23:14.582 --> 00:23:16.568
the influence of the Ara Pacis.
 

00:23:16.568 --> 00:23:20.531
This is again 20,
whereas the Ara Pacis wasn't

00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:22.028
begun until 13.
 

00:23:22.028 --> 00:23:23.730
And it shows us that this motif
was very much in the air,

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.500
during the Augustan period,
this motif of garlands hanging

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.929
from bucrania,
which of course makes reference

00:23:30.929 --> 00:23:33.971
to sacrifice,
and it could be a sacrifice in

00:23:33.971 --> 00:23:38.387
honor of a funerary event,
as well as anything else,

00:23:38.387 --> 00:23:42.048
and we again see that very well
here.

00:23:42.048 --> 00:23:48.474
One very interesting fact is
that the frieze is not made out

00:23:48.474 --> 00:23:52.830
of travertine but out of
pentelic marble,

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.009
p-e-n-t-e-l-i-c.
 

00:23:55.009 --> 00:23:59.538
Pentelic marble is marble from
Mount Pentelikon in Greece.

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:04.009
So it tells us that marble was
imported from Greece,

00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:07.358
or marble that was imported
from Greece was purchased and

00:24:07.358 --> 00:24:10.470
used for the frieze of this
particular structure,

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.470
and we'll see that it was used
also for the inscription plaque.

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.390
So it tells us something.
 

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.346
It tells us that there
was--that some patrons made the

00:24:19.346 --> 00:24:23.902
decision to spend a little more
for the material for what they

00:24:23.902 --> 00:24:28.009
considered the most important
part of the monument.

00:24:28.009 --> 00:24:31.781
So in this case the most
important part of the monument

00:24:31.781 --> 00:24:34.998
was the frieze,
and also the inscription plaque

00:24:34.998 --> 00:24:38.029
that preserved this woman's name
for posterity.

00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:41.394
So they paid a little bit more
in order to get that more

00:24:41.394 --> 00:24:44.513
expensive material for those
critical details of the

00:24:44.513 --> 00:24:45.309
monument.
 

00:24:45.309 --> 00:24:46.390
Here's the inscription.
 

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:48.618
We're very fortunate that it's
still preserved today.

00:24:48.618 --> 00:24:51.700
We see it still inserted into
the monument.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:57.171
Again, it's done in pentelic
marble, and I think you can see,

00:24:57.171 --> 00:25:01.638
even in this view,
the difference between pentelic

00:25:01.638 --> 00:25:04.009
marble and travertine.
 

00:25:04.009 --> 00:25:08.015
Travertine has more texture to
it than the plainer marble,

00:25:08.015 --> 00:25:09.210
as you can see.
 

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:14.398
And her name is given here,
Caecilia Metella:

00:25:14.398 --> 00:25:17.818
Caecilia Metella down here.
 

00:25:17.818 --> 00:25:23.112
And it tells us that she was
the daughter F(filia),

00:25:23.112 --> 00:25:27.240
f-i-l-i-a, the daughter of
Quintus Q.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.711
Creticus--Creticus,
C-r-e-t-i-c-u-s--who may have

00:25:31.711 --> 00:25:34.740
come from Crete;
it's possible.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.969
And it also makes reference to
the fact that she was married to

00:25:38.969 --> 00:25:41.220
someone by the name of Crassus.
 

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.960
This may be Crassus the Elder;
we're not absolutely sure.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.178
But what it does indicate to us
is this is an aristocratic

00:25:48.178 --> 00:25:48.630
woman.
 

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:52.576
This is an aristocratic woman
whose family has a great deal of

00:25:52.576 --> 00:25:56.521
money, who are honoring her with
this tomb, in the mode of the

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:59.654
day;
which of course was the tomb

00:25:59.654 --> 00:26:03.578
type that was chosen by Augustus
himself.

00:26:03.578 --> 00:26:06.338
You may have noticed up here,
in this same detail,

00:26:06.338 --> 00:26:08.740
not only the frieze that we've
already described,

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.588
with the garlands and
bucrania,

00:26:10.588 --> 00:26:14.680
but that there is a relief here
that represents a Roman trophy.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.808
What is a Roman trophy?
 

00:26:15.808 --> 00:26:20.170
What the Romans did at the end
of battle,

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:23.199
if they were victorious,
is they went over to the

00:26:23.199 --> 00:26:26.671
nearest tree trunk on the
battlefield and they took arms

00:26:26.671 --> 00:26:30.458
and armor from their defeated
enemy and they tacked that arms

00:26:30.458 --> 00:26:34.900
and armor up on that tree trunk,
to create a military trophy

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.920
commemorating their victory,
right on the battlefield.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.603
And that's exactly what you see
here, a tree trunk with a

00:26:42.603 --> 00:26:45.628
breastplate and a helmet and
shields and so on,

00:26:45.628 --> 00:26:47.798
all tacked up to that trophy.
 

00:26:47.798 --> 00:26:50.673
So we have to ask ourselves,
what is that trophy doing on

00:26:50.673 --> 00:26:52.058
this particular monument?
 

00:26:52.058 --> 00:26:55.884
It's highly unlikely that it
refers to--there are some

00:26:55.884 --> 00:26:59.626
instances;
we do hear about woman trying

00:26:59.626 --> 00:27:04.588
to raise money for troops and so
on and so forth.

00:27:04.588 --> 00:27:08.145
But we don't--and even thinking
that they might go into battle

00:27:08.145 --> 00:27:11.528
-- but for the most part Roman
women did not participate in

00:27:11.528 --> 00:27:12.170
battle.
 

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:16.865
So it is highly unlikely that
this refers to a military

00:27:16.865 --> 00:27:19.038
encounter that she had.
 

00:27:19.038 --> 00:27:22.628
More likely it either refers to
a military encounter of her

00:27:22.628 --> 00:27:25.662
father or her husband,
or it may be a more generic

00:27:25.662 --> 00:27:27.210
reference to victory.
 

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.740
We've talked about the fact
that in the minds of the Romans,

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.598
the victory in battle,
victory in the hunt,

00:27:33.598 --> 00:27:37.430
often were conflated with
victory over death.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.900
So it could be a more generic
reference,

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.818
but I would guess it may have
something to do more

00:27:43.818 --> 00:27:48.779
specifically with the conquest
of her husband or her father.

00:27:48.779 --> 00:27:55.145
The structure today is just
right there, out on the Via

00:27:55.145 --> 00:27:57.460
Appia;
easy to see.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.874
There is a small museum that
isn't all that often open,

00:28:00.874 --> 00:28:03.972
but sometimes it is,
that is in the remains of the

00:28:03.972 --> 00:28:06.440
fortress, and the palace next
door.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.588
You can see that the outside of
the monument,

00:28:09.588 --> 00:28:12.068
they've inserted a lot of finds
just from--

00:28:12.068 --> 00:28:15.269
it doesn't mean they came from
the Tomb of Caecilia Metella --

00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:17.410
but from this area on the Via
Appia.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.950
There were tons of Roman tombs
out here,

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:21.759
and all of this paraphernalia
that you see,

00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:25.890
statuary and fragments of
friezes and cornices and so on,

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.700
all come in part possibly from
this monument,

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.038
but more likely from the other
tombs in the area.

00:28:32.038 --> 00:28:34.561
Those have been inserted into
the wall in a kind of

00:28:34.561 --> 00:28:35.470
interesting way.
 

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.630
And then here's the museum
itself.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.281
The museum doesn't have--the
stuff that's in there is pretty

00:28:40.281 --> 00:28:42.440
much the same sort of thing that
you see here.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.849
But going into the museum is
interesting because you can see

00:28:46.849 --> 00:28:51.558
into the central chamber of the
Tomb of Caecilia Metella and see

00:28:51.558 --> 00:28:54.548
the concrete construction and so
on.

00:28:54.548 --> 00:29:00.115
I mentioned already that Roman
tombs could be very eccentric

00:29:00.115 --> 00:29:03.156
indeed,
and I want to show you one of

00:29:03.156 --> 00:29:06.491
the two most eccentric tombs,
in my opinion,

00:29:06.491 --> 00:29:11.328
from ancient Rome that one can
see in the city of Rome today.

00:29:11.328 --> 00:29:16.150
And the first of these is the
so-called Tomb of Cestius,

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:19.318
because we believe--in fact,
we're absolutely sure--

00:29:19.318 --> 00:29:22.078
that it honors a man by the
name of Gaius,

00:29:22.078 --> 00:29:25.009
G-a-i-u-s Cestius,
C-e-s-t-i-u-s;

00:29:25.009 --> 00:29:25.980
Gaius Cestius.
 

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.720
It was put up in 15 B.C.
 

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.568
That is in the age of the
emperor Augustus.

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:35.243
In this Google Earth aerial
view, we see what that structure

00:29:35.243 --> 00:29:36.750
looks like today.
 

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:42.288
It is a Roman tomb in the form
of an Egyptian pyramid.

00:29:42.288 --> 00:29:46.008
It's the only Roman tomb in the
form of an Egyptian pyramid that

00:29:46.008 --> 00:29:49.195
we can see in Rome today,
but we know there were others

00:29:49.195 --> 00:29:50.200
in antiquity.
 

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.800
We have reports that tell us
that certain others that existed

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.558
at a certain time were torn
down, at one point.

00:29:58.558 --> 00:30:00.501
There was one,
for example,

00:30:00.501 --> 00:30:04.239
not far from the Vatican,
that was torn down at one

00:30:04.239 --> 00:30:08.048
point, because it got in the way
of the street.

00:30:08.048 --> 00:30:10.298
So this is not unique in the
sense of the only one,

00:30:10.298 --> 00:30:12.640
although it is the only one
still surviving today.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.380
We have no idea how many of
these there were.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.670
There were certainly some.
 

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.838
Whether there were a lot,
we can't be absolutely certain.

00:30:18.838 --> 00:30:20.259
But here it is,
a Roman tomb,

00:30:20.259 --> 00:30:21.630
in the form of a pyramid.
 

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:25.208
Now when it was first put up,
it was put up outside the

00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:29.192
Servian Walls of the city,
because all--as we've talked

00:30:29.192 --> 00:30:33.683
about the fact that by Roman law
the necropolis or city of the

00:30:33.683 --> 00:30:38.029
dead needed to be located
outside the walls of the city.

00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:40.617
But as the city grew,
and as there was a need for a

00:30:40.617 --> 00:30:42.900
new wall--
and this happened in the third

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.118
century A.D.,
and we'll talk about it way at

00:30:45.118 --> 00:30:48.147
the end of this semester--
the Romans ended up building a

00:30:48.147 --> 00:30:51.308
new wall,
the famous Aurelian Walls.

00:30:51.308 --> 00:30:55.229
And the circuit happened to be
planned for this particular--to

00:30:55.229 --> 00:30:59.019
pass this particular point where
the Tomb of Cestius was.

00:30:59.019 --> 00:31:03.163
And fortunately they recognized
the aesthetic and historical

00:31:03.163 --> 00:31:06.915
value of this tomb,
and decided not to tear it

00:31:06.915 --> 00:31:12.009
down, but rather to incorporate
it into the Aurelian Walls.

00:31:12.009 --> 00:31:13.480
So what you see in this aerial
view are two of the walls--

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.068
two parts of the Aurelian Walls
abutting,

00:31:16.068 --> 00:31:20.720
and in fact incorporating,
the Pyramid of Cestius,

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.349
but in antiquity--when it was
first built,

00:31:23.349 --> 00:31:25.000
excuse me, it stood alone.
 

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.665
And what you see over here is a
gateway that also belongs to the

00:31:29.665 --> 00:31:31.368
later Aurelian Walls.
 

00:31:31.368 --> 00:31:36.920
So again, fortunately this
particular tomb was preserved.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:41.192
These two engravings are
helpful in showing us that the

00:31:41.192 --> 00:31:45.150
inner core of the Tomb of
Cestius was concrete,

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:49.421
and the outer pyramidal shape
was faced once again with

00:31:49.421 --> 00:31:50.450
travertine.
 

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.594
So travertine clearly the
material of choice by

00:31:53.594 --> 00:31:56.067
aristocrats--
because we're going to see that

00:31:56.067 --> 00:31:59.450
Cestius was also an aristocrat--
for their tombs in the age of

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:03.940
Augustus: concrete core,
travertine facing.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.155
And then if you look at this
cutaway view over here,

00:32:07.155 --> 00:32:10.434
you will see that the burial
chamber inside was very,

00:32:10.434 --> 00:32:15.009
very, very small;
very, very, very small.

00:32:15.009 --> 00:32:18.200
So small enough that there was
not a lot of space for these

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.849
burials;
but we'll see that we still

00:32:20.849 --> 00:32:24.038
believe that this too was a
family tomb.

00:32:24.038 --> 00:32:29.434
The burial chamber has had,
and still has,

00:32:29.434 --> 00:32:33.118
remnants of painted walls.
 

00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:36.473
And I show you an engraving
here of those walls that was

00:32:36.473 --> 00:32:39.950
made when they were in somewhat
better shape than they are

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:40.558
today.
 

00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:43.886
And I wondered if any of
you--you're such experts now on

00:32:43.886 --> 00:32:46.608
First to Fourth Style Roman wall
painting--

00:32:46.608 --> 00:32:48.970
if any of you could tell
me--I'm sure all of you could

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:52.681
tell me--
what style painting is being

00:32:52.681 --> 00:32:58.549
used in the burial chamber of
the Tomb of Cestius?

00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:59.769
Student:  Third Style.
 

00:32:59.769 --> 00:33:00.817
Prof: Third style.
 

00:33:00.817 --> 00:33:01.528
Why Third Style?
 

00:33:01.528 --> 00:33:04.858
Student:  There's
floating mythological features

00:33:04.858 --> 00:33:06.338
and very thin columns.
 

00:33:06.338 --> 00:33:09.111
Prof: Very thin
candelabra here,

00:33:09.111 --> 00:33:11.078
and mythological figures.
 

00:33:11.078 --> 00:33:14.823
How are those used that
make--that show that this is a

00:33:14.823 --> 00:33:16.730
typical Third Style wall?
 

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.106
Student:  They have a
blackout laying around them and

00:33:19.106 --> 00:33:20.720
they're just floating around in
space.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.769
Prof: That's the word,
floating.

00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:24.051
They are floating in this
random space,

00:33:24.051 --> 00:33:26.935
right in the center of the
panels, as we know was

00:33:26.935 --> 00:33:30.180
characteristic of Third Style
Roman wall painting.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:34.038
So 15 B.C., Third Style Roman
wall painting.

00:33:34.038 --> 00:33:37.880
And if you think back to some
of the palaces or villas that we

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.656
looked at and their dates--think
of Boscotrecase for example,

00:33:41.656 --> 00:33:42.348
11 B.C.
 

00:33:42.348 --> 00:33:46.891
You see this is roughly
contemporary to what's happening

00:33:46.891 --> 00:33:50.029
in Campania at this particular
time.

00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:54.009
And here are two details of the
remains of those paintings,

00:33:54.009 --> 00:33:56.520
and you can see one of these
floating mythological figures

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.460
that looks like a victory
figure: female,

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.400
winged, carrying a wreath over
here,

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.269
flying in the center of the
panel.

00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:04.040
This also shows you,
in this case,

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.617
the panels were white,
very similar to the walls,

00:34:06.617 --> 00:34:08.925
for example,
of the Third Style in the Domus

00:34:08.925 --> 00:34:10.000
Aurea in Rome.
 

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.719
And then here,
this candelabrum,

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:15.353
very attenuated,
very delicate,

00:34:15.353 --> 00:34:18.599
that is used in place of
columns;

00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:23.130
both of these motifs decorating
the flat wall that was so

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:27.340
characteristic of Third Style
Roman wall painting.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.300
Here's another view of the
pyramid as it looks today.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.891
You can see it is exceedingly
well preserved,

00:34:32.891 --> 00:34:35.659
one of the best preserved of
all Roman tombs.

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:40.273
You can see again the way in
which the later wall was built

00:34:40.273 --> 00:34:42.945
into it,
and you can also see the

00:34:42.945 --> 00:34:46.983
travertine blocks and how
carefully carved they were by

00:34:46.983 --> 00:34:49.539
the designers,
by the artisans.

00:34:49.539 --> 00:34:55.340
And here, this is very helpful,
because it shows you that the--

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.476
at least one,
but I can tell you that two

00:34:57.476 --> 00:35:00.298
sides of the tomb,
the eastern and western sides

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:03.021
of the tomb,
had in the center of the

00:35:03.021 --> 00:35:05.320
pyramid the name of Cestius.
 

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.670
That's how we know it was his
tomb.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.800
You see it here, Gaius Cestius.
 

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.199
And it also includes all of his
titles.

00:35:11.199 --> 00:35:15.481
So he was very happy to
advertise his titles on this

00:35:15.481 --> 00:35:17.940
monument,
the purpose of which,

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:22.081
of course, was for those who
mourned him to feel proud of him

00:35:22.081 --> 00:35:23.739
and his achievements.
 

00:35:23.739 --> 00:35:26.900
But even more important than
that, from his point of view I

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.146
am sure,
and from the point of view of

00:35:29.146 --> 00:35:32.503
the Romans in general,
was that his name and his deeds

00:35:32.503 --> 00:35:35.400
be preserved for posterity so
that someday--

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.199
in 2009, we're sitting in this
classroom looking at this--

00:35:39.199 --> 00:35:42.360
we think back on Cestius,
his title,

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.474
what he did,
what he achieved,

00:35:44.474 --> 00:35:47.610
and the way in which he was
memorialized.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.367
So this whole idea of
preserving memory,

00:35:50.367 --> 00:35:54.539
not only in your own time,
but into the far flung future.

00:35:54.539 --> 00:35:57.210
This tomb, as I said,
despite the fact that the

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:00.286
burial chamber is small,
we do believe it was a family

00:36:00.286 --> 00:36:00.809
tomb.
 

00:36:00.809 --> 00:36:04.400
We have evidence for that,
because two bases were found

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.860
that seemed to belong to this
tomb;

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.568
in fact, it's Cestius' name,
or members of his family,

00:36:09.568 --> 00:36:11.869
Cestius, you can see there,
are named in these

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:12.739
inscriptions.
 

00:36:12.739 --> 00:36:17.103
These have markings on the top
that suggest to us that statues

00:36:17.103 --> 00:36:19.250
stood on them,
at one point.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:24.396
So these were statue bases,
probably placed right in front

00:36:24.396 --> 00:36:28.010
of the entrance to the pyramidal
tomb.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:30.563
And if you cast your eyes over
this inscription you will not

00:36:30.563 --> 00:36:32.340
only see the name Cestius a few
times,

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.610
but you will see another very
important name,

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.800
and that is M.***Agrippa.
 

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.099
That's Marcus Agrippa,
that's the Marcus Agrippa,

00:36:41.099 --> 00:36:45.887
the longtime--the boyhood
friend and longtime close

00:36:45.887 --> 00:36:51.250
confidant and onetime heir and
son-in-law of Augustus;

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.000
all of those things.
 

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.018
He's mentioned here.
 

00:36:54.018 --> 00:36:56.699
So he is a member also of this
family.

00:36:56.699 --> 00:36:59.987
So it demonstrates to us again
we are dealing with an

00:36:59.987 --> 00:37:01.380
aristocratic family.
 

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.119
So all of those tombs I've
shown you thus far--

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:05.860
the Mausoleum of Augustus,
the Tomb of Caecilia Metella,

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:09.760
and the Tomb of Gaius
Cestius--are all examples of

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.219
aristocratic tomb architecture
in the age of Augustus.

00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:19.396
Why did he choose a pyramid for
his tomb is a very interesting

00:37:19.396 --> 00:37:22.813
question to ask,
and I would suggest here--and

00:37:22.813 --> 00:37:26.050
it's not rocket science to
figure this out at all--

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:29.764
I would suggest here though
that the reason has to do with

00:37:29.764 --> 00:37:33.804
Augustus' very important victory
over Mark Antony and Cleopatra

00:37:33.804 --> 00:37:36.018
at the Battle of Actium in 31.
 

00:37:36.018 --> 00:37:38.405
It was at that time,
and even before,

00:37:38.405 --> 00:37:41.920
that an interest in things
Egyptian came into Rome.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:47.460
We saw that Augustus himself
made reference to his victory

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:51.398
over that pair,
over Cleopatra and Mark Antony,

00:37:51.398 --> 00:37:55.141
in the complex with the Ara
Pacis and the Mausoleum of

00:37:55.141 --> 00:37:58.824
Augustus,
by inserting that obelisk in

00:37:58.824 --> 00:38:01.132
the center;
an obelisk that I have

00:38:01.132 --> 00:38:04.039
mentioned to you was actually
brought from Egypt itself.

00:38:04.039 --> 00:38:06.496
So these references to Egypt,
initially under Augustus

00:38:06.496 --> 00:38:07.980
himself, had political import.
 

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.320
It was there to show that
Augustus had been--

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:14.168
that obelisk was there to show
that Augustus had prevailed over

00:38:14.168 --> 00:38:17.934
Mark Antony and Cleopatra,
and because he had prevailed,

00:38:17.934 --> 00:38:21.730
he could steal obelisks from
Egypt and bring them back to

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:24.280
decorate Rome,
as trophies essentially.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.960
So that was a political
statement on his part.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.248
But as time went on,
Egyptomania became a kind of

00:38:29.248 --> 00:38:30.619
fashion statement.
 

00:38:30.619 --> 00:38:34.304
I think that it caught on;
it caught on after Egypt was

00:38:34.304 --> 00:38:36.699
made a Roman province in 30
B.C.,

00:38:36.699 --> 00:38:39.744
right after Actium,
and we begin to see this wave

00:38:39.744 --> 00:38:42.599
of things Egyptian spreading
through Rome,

00:38:42.599 --> 00:38:45.132
and it's likely that
Cestius--perhaps a combination

00:38:45.132 --> 00:38:47.092
of both,
since he's from Agrippa's

00:38:47.092 --> 00:38:49.900
family, this combination of
political reference,

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:53.380
but also just this was an
interesting--

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.079
this was the style at this
particular point,

00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:59.130
to do things in the Egyptian
manner.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:02.744
You might remember some of
those Egyptianizing motifs that

00:39:02.744 --> 00:39:03.920
we saw,
for example,

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.630
from the Black Room at
Boscotrecase,

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:09.657
which was also a villa that was
closely connected with the

00:39:09.657 --> 00:39:10.929
imperial family.
 

00:39:10.929 --> 00:39:15.083
You remember Agrippa Postumus
who was the son of Agrippa

00:39:15.083 --> 00:39:19.389
himself, born by his wife Julia,
after Agrippa's death;

00:39:19.389 --> 00:39:21.659
hence his name.
 

00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:25.409
Another view of the back of the
Pyramid of Cestius,

00:39:25.409 --> 00:39:29.460
the Mausoleum of Cestius,
which again shows us how well

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.960
preserved it is.
 

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.668
You can see the Aurelian Walls,
you can see the gate that we

00:39:34.668 --> 00:39:37.559
looked at before,
and you can also see that the

00:39:37.559 --> 00:39:40.199
back is actually in a modern
cemetery.

00:39:40.199 --> 00:39:42.668
This is the so-called
Protestant Cemetery,

00:39:42.668 --> 00:39:46.282
and if you are in Rome and have
time, this is one of the most

00:39:46.282 --> 00:39:48.210
interesting places to visit.
 

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:50.039
It's again a bit off the beaten
track.

00:39:50.039 --> 00:39:52.925
Not that many tourists go
there, but those that do are

00:39:52.925 --> 00:39:56.289
rewarded,
because it's a cemetery where

00:39:56.289 --> 00:40:00.914
many expatriates were buried --
people who flocked to Rome

00:40:00.914 --> 00:40:02.360
because they loved it.
 

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.699
Authors, scholars,
poets, painters came to Rome,

00:40:06.699 --> 00:40:09.289
ended up spending the rest of
their lives there--

00:40:09.289 --> 00:40:11.199
coming from all different
countries around the world--

00:40:11.199 --> 00:40:13.010
spending the rest of their
lives there,

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.534
dying there,
and eventually being buried in

00:40:15.534 --> 00:40:17.699
the so-called Protestant
Cemetery.

00:40:17.699 --> 00:40:20.190
Percy Bysshe Shelley,
for example,

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.909
is buried there,
as is John Keats.

00:40:22.909 --> 00:40:25.184
And the Keats tomb,
Keats marker,

00:40:25.184 --> 00:40:28.099
is my favorite by far in this
cemetery.

00:40:28.099 --> 00:40:32.054
You can see his tombstone here,
which doesn't even give his

00:40:32.054 --> 00:40:35.753
name, it just identifies him;
and you'll remember he died

00:40:35.753 --> 00:40:38.452
very, very young,
in his early twenties I think

00:40:38.452 --> 00:40:39.039
it was.
 

00:40:39.039 --> 00:40:41.579
You see him here referred to
only as "the young English

00:40:41.579 --> 00:40:42.139
poet."
 

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:45.614
And down below it says,
"Here lies one whose name

00:40:45.614 --> 00:40:47.320
was writ in water."
 

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.400
It's an amazing stone.
 

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.704
It does show the lyre,
which makes reference,

00:40:52.704 --> 00:40:57.510
of course, to the fluency and
so on of his mellifluous poetry.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:00.039
And over here,
a companion of his,

00:41:00.039 --> 00:41:03.487
Joseph Severn,
who doesn't hesitate to mention

00:41:03.487 --> 00:41:06.170
his relationship to John Keats.
 

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:10.965
So you see Keats' name in
Severn's tombstone but not in

00:41:10.965 --> 00:41:13.010
Keats' own tombstone.
 

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:16.322
But I show this to you just
because it's one of those more

00:41:16.322 --> 00:41:18.010
fascinating places in Rome.
 

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.467
And many of the tombs,
by the way--there are many

00:41:20.467 --> 00:41:23.231
tombstones here that clearly are
based on ancient Roman

00:41:23.231 --> 00:41:24.000
prototypes.
 

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.070
So it's a fascinating place to
wander.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.378
And by the way,
you can do that in our own

00:41:28.378 --> 00:41:31.135
Grove Street Cemetery,
where there are a number of

00:41:31.135 --> 00:41:34.119
tombs that are done very much in
the Roman style.

00:41:34.119 --> 00:41:38.630
If you think the Tomb of
Cestius is unusual,

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:43.210
the weirdest tomb by far in
Rome, from ancient Rome,

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:46.599
is the one that I turn to now,
and this is the Tomb of the

00:41:46.599 --> 00:41:49.532
baker Eurysaces,
the Tomb of the baker Eurysaces

00:41:49.532 --> 00:41:52.730
that was put up in Rome in the
late first century B.C.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:56.639
And that again is another tomb
from the age of Augustus.

00:41:56.639 --> 00:42:00.438
But in this case we believe,
although the inscription

00:42:00.438 --> 00:42:04.550
doesn't tell us this for sure,
but we believe it is highly

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:08.014
likely that Eurysaces is from a
different level of Roman

00:42:08.014 --> 00:42:10.347
society,
not an aristocrat,

00:42:10.347 --> 00:42:13.239
but a working man who
probably--

00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:18.190
either he himself or his family
were slaves originally,

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.768
eventually freed.
 

00:42:19.768 --> 00:42:23.760
He takes up the profession of
bread making and he ends up

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:28.108
building this extraordinary tomb
that I'm going to show you in

00:42:28.108 --> 00:42:29.889
some detail, in Rome.
 

00:42:29.889 --> 00:42:33.277
As we look at this particular
view, we see the Tomb of

00:42:33.277 --> 00:42:36.480
Eurysaces, as it looks today;
it's right over here.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.302
We see it has behind it a great
travertine gate,

00:42:40.302 --> 00:42:43.070
which is actually later in
date.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:44.860
It dates to the time of the
emperor Claudius.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.409
We'll talk about it next week.
 

00:42:46.409 --> 00:42:48.889
So you have to think that away
for the moment.

00:42:48.889 --> 00:42:52.849
That was not standing when the
Tomb of Eurysaces was put up.

00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:55.782
You can also see,
however, that this gate was

00:42:55.782 --> 00:42:57.849
placed in an aqueduct system.
 

00:42:57.849 --> 00:43:03.010
That aqueduct was begun during
the time of Augustus.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:05.719
So you can imagine that at
least some of that aqueduct

00:43:05.719 --> 00:43:08.380
system stood at the time that
this tomb was built.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:11.929
The tomb, as you can see here,
was a three-storied structure,

00:43:11.929 --> 00:43:14.000
very eccentric in its
appearance.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.469
The ground line today is much
lower than the modern ground

00:43:18.469 --> 00:43:19.018
line.
 

00:43:19.018 --> 00:43:22.039
So you have to go right up to
the monument.

00:43:22.039 --> 00:43:24.030
You can look down at the first
story.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:25.530
So you're only seeing a part of
the first story here.

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:29.699
You can see that it is made of
tufa blocks.

00:43:29.699 --> 00:43:32.530
You can also see the interior
is concrete,

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:34.710
the core of the structure is
concrete,

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:37.000
and then on the second and
third stories,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.949
the tomb is faced with
travertine.

00:43:40.949 --> 00:43:44.916
So travertine again used for
tomb facing in the age in

00:43:44.916 --> 00:43:45.739
Augustus.
 

00:43:45.739 --> 00:43:53.172
And we see this very unusual
design where there are these

00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:59.409
great--not piers--cylinders,
great cylinders;

00:43:59.409 --> 00:44:02.346
great cylinders that are placed
here vertically,

00:44:02.346 --> 00:44:05.969
and then cylinders placed in
the next tier horizontally.

00:44:05.969 --> 00:44:07.869
Vertically placed cylinders.
 

00:44:07.869 --> 00:44:09.170
They're not columns.
 

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:10.369
You don't see any capitals.
 

00:44:10.369 --> 00:44:11.570
They're very fat.
 

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:14.693
So they are cylinders,
vertically, and then

00:44:14.693 --> 00:44:15.809
horizontally.
 

00:44:15.809 --> 00:44:18.663
And some scholars have
suggested, and I think quite

00:44:18.663 --> 00:44:21.003
convincingly,
that these may actually make

00:44:21.003 --> 00:44:23.400
reference to what were grain
measures.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:27.135
Grain measures were these
cylindrical structures in silos,

00:44:27.135 --> 00:44:30.673
in a sense, in which they
stored grain in ancient Roman

00:44:30.673 --> 00:44:31.329
times.
 

00:44:31.329 --> 00:44:34.831
So that is very possible,
since we know that this man was

00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:38.255
a baker,
that this may make reference to

00:44:38.255 --> 00:44:43.637
these grain storage cylinders
that were used in the process of

00:44:43.637 --> 00:44:44.518
baking.
 

00:44:44.518 --> 00:44:46.119
With regard to the siting of
the tomb--

00:44:46.119 --> 00:44:49.967
this is particularly
interesting--I show you this

00:44:49.967 --> 00:44:53.302
plan over here,
which indicates to us--here you

00:44:53.302 --> 00:44:56.539
can actually see the plan of the
Tomb of Eurysaces,

00:44:56.539 --> 00:44:58.909
and you can see that it is very
unusual in shape.

00:44:58.909 --> 00:45:00.969
It is trapezoidal in shape.
 

00:45:00.969 --> 00:45:03.300
Why is it trapezoidal in shape?
 

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.708
It probably is trapezoidal in
shape because the tomb was

00:45:07.708 --> 00:45:12.679
located on a piece of property
that was between two major roads

00:45:12.679 --> 00:45:17.329
of Rome that exited and entered
the city at this particular

00:45:17.329 --> 00:45:20.856
point: the so-called Via
Labicana and the Via

00:45:20.856 --> 00:45:22.460
Praenestina.
 

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.833
So two major Roman roads that
come into the city at this

00:45:26.833 --> 00:45:27.469
point.
 

00:45:27.469 --> 00:45:28.760
And remember,
the Tomb of Eurysaces,

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.199
like all Roman tombs during
this period,

00:45:31.199 --> 00:45:34.280
was outside the Servian Walls,
so built outside the walls,

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:39.610
but between these two streets.
 

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.677
Now this model over here,
which by the way comes from a

00:45:42.677 --> 00:45:45.690
museum in Rome that again is off
the beaten track,

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:49.476
but I can highly recommend the
Museo Civilità

00:45:49.476 --> 00:45:52.485
Romana,
which is in a building built by

00:45:52.485 --> 00:45:55.699
Mussolini in the 1930s for a
World's Fair,

00:45:55.699 --> 00:45:59.050
and the buildings--and it and
other buildings like it out

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:02.137
there,
in a place--part of Rome that

00:46:02.137 --> 00:46:06.530
we call EUR from Esposizione
Universale di Roma,

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.768
E-U-R, EUR.
 

00:46:08.768 --> 00:46:12.039
That whole area built up by
Mussolini for the World's Fair.

00:46:12.039 --> 00:46:15.378
But the buildings were so
substantial that they decided to

00:46:15.378 --> 00:46:18.952
keep them, and they still stand,
and this museum was placed in

00:46:18.952 --> 00:46:19.889
one of them.
 

00:46:19.889 --> 00:46:23.150
It is a museum of casts,
where you can go and see works

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:26.534
of Roman art and architecture
from not only Rome but from

00:46:26.534 --> 00:46:28.889
around the world,
all in one place.

00:46:28.889 --> 00:46:30.320
Now they're not originals,
they're casts,

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.644
but it'd be a great place to
study for the exam for this

00:46:33.644 --> 00:46:34.724
course,
for example,

00:46:34.724 --> 00:46:37.061
because you can walk around and
see so many of the buildings

00:46:37.061 --> 00:46:38.130
that we've talked about.
 

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:40.739
And there are these wonderful
models of many of them.

00:46:40.739 --> 00:46:45.188
And we see here a model of this
aqueduct, the later gate here,

00:46:45.188 --> 00:46:47.230
and the Tomb of Eurysaces.
 

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:50.086
And this shows you very well
the way in which these two

00:46:50.086 --> 00:46:51.779
streets,
the Labicana and the

00:46:51.779 --> 00:46:54.219
Praenestina, came into Rome at
this point,

00:46:54.219 --> 00:46:58.768
converged exactly on the
façade of this tomb.

00:46:58.768 --> 00:47:03.630
And this--it is clear that
Eurysaces--

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:05.650
and I'll tell you how he did
this in a moment--

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:09.677
had enough money that he was
able to buy what was certainly

00:47:09.677 --> 00:47:13.010
one of the most choice pieces of
real estate,

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:16.213
outside the walls of Rome,
one in which everyone who came

00:47:16.213 --> 00:47:19.704
into Rome from either of those
two thoroughfares would see the

00:47:19.704 --> 00:47:21.480
façade of this tomb.
 

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:26.010
This is a man who wanted to be
remembered for posterity.

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:29.322
It's another example of how
tombs were used for the purposes

00:47:29.322 --> 00:47:31.119
of retaining memory over time.
 

00:47:31.119 --> 00:47:37.010
This is also interesting
because it shows what happened.

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:40.014
What you see with the dotted
lines here is one of these later

00:47:40.014 --> 00:47:42.268
gates that was made for the
Aurelian Walls.

00:47:42.268 --> 00:47:45.128
And in this case,
the Tomb of Eurysaces was right

00:47:45.128 --> 00:47:48.402
smack dab in the middle of where
they wanted to build an

00:47:48.402 --> 00:47:50.130
outcropping of this wall.
 

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:53.789
In this case they decided that
they were not going to build the

00:47:53.789 --> 00:47:56.150
wall into it,
but that they were going to

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:58.039
build the wall on top of it.
 

00:47:58.039 --> 00:48:01.135
But fortunately,
again, they did not destroy it

00:48:01.135 --> 00:48:02.010
completely.
 

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:05.360
They did shear off the front of
the tomb,

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.840
which actually took away the
façade,

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:10.389
but they allowed the debris to
fall into the tower,

00:48:10.389 --> 00:48:12.699
and then they covered it up.
 

00:48:12.699 --> 00:48:17.027
So when this tower was
eventually torn down to free the

00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:20.608
Tomb of Eurysaces,
they found the fourth wall and

00:48:20.608 --> 00:48:24.338
the debris from that wall,
including a portrait statue and

00:48:24.338 --> 00:48:26.550
an inscription inside the
debris,

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:29.385
which was extremely fortunate,
and which allows us to

00:48:29.385 --> 00:48:30.860
reconstruct the monument.
 

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:35.978
Here you see the model in this
EUR Museum that shows you what

00:48:35.978 --> 00:48:39.050
the tomb looked like in
antiquity.

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:41.940
You see the three levels,
the three tiers.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.460
You see the entrance to the
burial chamber here.

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.849
And this is the façade
that we're looking at;

00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:49.050
this is the part that no longer
survives.

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:51.500
This is the fourth wall or the
façade,

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.340
now gone, but we can again
reconstruct it from those

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.010
remains.
 

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:57.954
And you see them here,
and you see it was relatively

00:48:57.954 --> 00:49:00.956
plain on three tiers,
except for a portrait statue of

00:49:00.956 --> 00:49:04.518
Eurysaces and his wife,
an inscription down below.

00:49:04.518 --> 00:49:07.760
And you need to think away the
frieze up there,

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.860
because the frieze was probably
not on this side of the

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.748
monument,
although there was a frieze

00:49:12.748 --> 00:49:14.079
around the other three sides.
 

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:17.085
You can see one of those sides
here, and I'll show that frieze

00:49:17.085 --> 00:49:18.119
to you momentarily.
 

00:49:18.119 --> 00:49:22.255
This is a view of the tomb
again, where we can see so well

00:49:22.255 --> 00:49:24.650
those cylinders on two stories.
 

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:30.157
And you can also see here that
in the area between the vertical

00:49:30.157 --> 00:49:33.869
and the horizontal cylinders,
on three sides of the monument,

00:49:33.869 --> 00:49:36.177
there is an inscription,
and it repeats over and over

00:49:36.177 --> 00:49:38.570
again,
and it tells us that this

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:41.289
monument was put up by
Eurysaces,

00:49:41.289 --> 00:49:47.586
Marcus Vergilius Eurysaces,
who was pistor and

00:49:47.586 --> 00:49:51.068
redemptor--
p-i-s-t-o-r,

00:49:51.068 --> 00:49:54.510
r-e-d-e-m-p-t-o-
r--pistor and

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:56.010
redemptor.
 

00:49:56.010 --> 00:50:00.141
That means master baker and
contractor--the contractor is

00:50:00.141 --> 00:50:04.199
the most important part--master
baker and contractor.

00:50:04.199 --> 00:50:09.085
We know this is a man who made
bread and sold it to the Roman

00:50:09.085 --> 00:50:09.820
armies.
 

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.914
This was a pretty lucrative
thing to do in the age of

00:50:13.914 --> 00:50:18.010
Augustus when there was so much
military conquest.

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:20.630
He made a fortune selling bread
to the Roman armies,

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:23.851
and it is with that fortune
that he was able to buy this

00:50:23.851 --> 00:50:27.309
choice piece of real estate and
to put up this extraordinary

00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:29.829
monument in the late first
century B.C.

00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:32.369
The portrait relief still
survives.

00:50:32.369 --> 00:50:34.730
It's in the Capitoline Museums
today.

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:36.420
You see it here.
 

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.429
It had fallen in again to the
debris,

00:50:38.429 --> 00:50:41.594
from the fourth side,
but here it is with Eurysaces

00:50:41.594 --> 00:50:44.856
standing next to his wife,
Atistia--we know her name and

00:50:44.856 --> 00:50:47.922
I'll tell you how in a moment--
Atistia, in that portrait

00:50:47.922 --> 00:50:48.400
relief.
 

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.059
And we're not going to go into
this in any detail,

00:50:51.059 --> 00:50:54.443
but if you compare it to the
figures of Augustus and his

00:50:54.443 --> 00:50:56.215
family,
from the Ara Pacis,

00:50:56.215 --> 00:50:59.869
I think you'll agree with me
that the Ara Pacis is serving as

00:50:59.869 --> 00:51:03.054
a model,
and that this portrait group is

00:51:03.054 --> 00:51:07.438
clearly based on aristocratic--
even though this is probably a

00:51:07.438 --> 00:51:11.414
middle-class pair,
formerly from a slave family,

00:51:11.414 --> 00:51:12.739
freed people.
 

00:51:12.739 --> 00:51:16.663
They are shown here very much
as if they are members of the

00:51:16.663 --> 00:51:20.585
court, wearing similar costumes,
depicted in a similar way,

00:51:20.585 --> 00:51:22.480
with similar hairstyles.
 

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.090
And I point to just one detail.
 

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:29.039
If you look at this view of
Livia, on the Ara Pacis,

00:51:29.039 --> 00:51:30.789
Augustus' wife,
and you see the wonderful way

00:51:30.789 --> 00:51:32.579
in which the artist has depicted
her hand,

00:51:32.579 --> 00:51:35.949
the shape of her hand showing
underneath her garment here;

00:51:35.949 --> 00:51:40.144
the same is done here for
Atistia, you can see--and that's

00:51:40.144 --> 00:51:42.280
A-t-i-s-t-i-a--for Atistia.
 

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:45.050
You can see her hand.
 

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:46.795
In fact, it's even better done
here because you can see the

00:51:46.795 --> 00:51:50.306
shape of the knuckles and so on,
underneath the garment,

00:51:50.306 --> 00:51:55.010
the very diaphanous garment
that she wears.

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:57.065
So clearly a very special
portrait artist,

00:51:57.065 --> 00:51:59.018
probably hired to do these
portraits;

00:51:59.018 --> 00:52:04.650
a portrait artist who may have
been hired at great expense.

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:07.800
And also very significant,
and in keeping with what we saw

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.789
for the Tomb of Caecilia
Metella,

00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:14.233
is the fact that although the
tomb is faced in travertine and

00:52:14.233 --> 00:52:18.010
the relief around the monument
is in travertine,

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:21.039
this is done in marble,
in, if I remember correctly,

00:52:21.039 --> 00:52:24.010
Greek marble, as well.
 

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:27.478
So imported marble that is
brought from elsewhere and at

00:52:27.478 --> 00:52:31.579
greater expense is used for the
most important portrait relief.

00:52:31.579 --> 00:52:34.599
The scenes around the--the
scenes,

00:52:34.599 --> 00:52:37.820
the frieze scenes,
are particularly interesting

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:41.179
because they depict in the
greatest of detail the

00:52:41.179 --> 00:52:43.840
profession of the making of
bread.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:49.293
They depict Eurysaces' daily
achievement of making bread that

00:52:49.293 --> 00:52:52.018
he sold to the Roman armies.
 

00:52:52.018 --> 00:52:54.170
I'm going to just show you the
scenes very quickly,

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:56.150
and you can see the style is
very different.

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:58.510
It's a much more journalistic
style,

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:02.347
with figures that don't have
the elegant proportions that we

00:53:02.347 --> 00:53:06.347
saw in the portrait relief,
and it is carved on travertine,

00:53:06.347 --> 00:53:07.340
not on marble.
 

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:12.266
We see here the grain being
ground between two stones,

00:53:12.266 --> 00:53:18.030
and we see the way in which
these men in tunics worked that.

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:21.902
We also see that the upper
stone is rotated by a mule that

00:53:21.902 --> 00:53:25.842
is attached to a wooden handle
that comes off the uppermost

00:53:25.842 --> 00:53:26.929
stone there.
 

00:53:26.929 --> 00:53:29.579
We have millstones just like
this, from Pompeii,

00:53:29.579 --> 00:53:31.780
and I show you the actual
millstones.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:34.909
So these depictions on the Tomb
of Eurysaces:

00:53:34.909 --> 00:53:38.822
very accurate in terms or what
millstones looked like in

00:53:38.822 --> 00:53:39.820
antiquity.
 

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:44.429
Another scene here in which we
see two men at a table with big

00:53:44.429 --> 00:53:47.150
gobs of dough,
that you can see here,

00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:49.039
dough, for the bread.
 

00:53:49.039 --> 00:53:53.275
Another scene--this is one of
the more important scenes--where

00:53:53.275 --> 00:53:57.512
we see four men standing behind
a table, that are forming that

00:53:57.512 --> 00:53:59.039
dough into loaves.
 

00:53:59.039 --> 00:54:04.422
And over here a magistrate,
who has a short-sleeved but

00:54:04.422 --> 00:54:08.010
long garment,
is supervising them.

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:10.186
And the four men are very
interestingly rendered because

00:54:10.186 --> 00:54:11.889
they're rendered almost exactly
the same.

00:54:11.889 --> 00:54:13.842
If you look,
if you compare this to the Ara

00:54:13.842 --> 00:54:16.027
Pacis where figures are
represented in different

00:54:16.027 --> 00:54:17.751
postures,
a lot of variety,

00:54:17.751 --> 00:54:19.960
clearly based on Greek
prototypes.

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.750
Here we see something very
different.

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:25.706
The major objective of the
artist is to get the story

00:54:25.706 --> 00:54:29.360
across, to show these men making
these loaves.

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.719
But look at them.
 

00:54:30.719 --> 00:54:33.880
Each one--they're bare chested,
and we'll see why they're bare

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:34.400
chested.
 

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.949
It's hot in this part of the
bakery.

00:54:36.949 --> 00:54:38.440
So they've taken off their
shirts.

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.449
There's some attempt to depict
their musculature.

00:54:41.449 --> 00:54:44.280
But they're essentially shown
in exactly the same way,

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.347
the same curly hair,
almost as if they were cut from

00:54:47.347 --> 00:54:50.231
a cookie cutter,
because again it's not the form

00:54:50.231 --> 00:54:52.480
that's of interest to the artist
here,

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.219
but getting that narrative
across.

00:54:54.219 --> 00:54:57.009
And if you try to figure out
whose legs belong to whom,

00:54:57.009 --> 00:54:59.539
believe me, you'll have a
difficult time of it.

00:54:59.539 --> 00:55:02.849
So the artist is not--is much
less concerned with formal

00:55:02.849 --> 00:55:05.860
things than he is with getting
the story across.

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:08.315
With regard to why they've
taken off their shirts,

00:55:08.315 --> 00:55:09.820
they're right near the oven.
 

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:13.757
And I show you the scene that
depicts the dome-shaped oven in

00:55:13.757 --> 00:55:16.119
which the loaves are being
baked,

00:55:16.119 --> 00:55:19.918
and you can see that this oven
looks very much like a modern

00:55:19.918 --> 00:55:22.469
pizza oven,
and in fact the pole that they

00:55:22.469 --> 00:55:24.565
use,
the wooden pole with the flat

00:55:24.565 --> 00:55:28.039
end, is just the sort of thing
you see at BAR or any other

00:55:28.039 --> 00:55:30.842
major pizza place,
either in New Haven or

00:55:30.842 --> 00:55:32.440
elsewhere in the world.
 

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:34.875
And, in fact,
these dome-shaped ovens are

00:55:34.875 --> 00:55:36.579
still used in rural areas.
 

00:55:36.579 --> 00:55:41.599
And I took this view in Greece,
in a small rural town,

00:55:41.599 --> 00:55:44.949
and you see these in Italy in
some very small towns as well,

00:55:44.949 --> 00:55:47.730
still being done in exactly the
same way.

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:50.898
There are a number--because of
the cylinders on the Tomb of

00:55:50.898 --> 00:55:53.246
Eurysaces,
there are some scholars who've

00:55:53.246 --> 00:55:56.248
suggested that the Tomb of
Eurysaces is in the form of a

00:55:56.248 --> 00:55:56.849
bakery .
 

00:55:56.849 --> 00:56:01.059
While I do believe that there
is reference to those grain--

00:56:01.059 --> 00:56:04.474
to those storage bins,
silos that were used for the

00:56:04.474 --> 00:56:07.990
storage of grain,
I do not think that the Tomb of

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:10.559
Eurysaces is in the form of an
oven.

00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:13.012
It makes reference to baking,
but I don't think it's in the

00:56:13.012 --> 00:56:14.789
form of an oven,
because this is what Roman

00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:15.719
ovens looked like.
 

00:56:15.719 --> 00:56:16.760
They were dome-shaped.
 

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:20.969
This has a very different
appearance, as you can see.

00:56:20.969 --> 00:56:24.630
Perhaps the most important
scene in the frieze is this one,

00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:28.690
where we see two--we see the
loaves have been baked,

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:33.143
they're ready to go to market,
and they're put in these large

00:56:33.143 --> 00:56:35.838
baskets--
you can see them here--and then

00:56:35.838 --> 00:56:39.099
they are weighed in this scale,
in this ancient scale.

00:56:39.099 --> 00:56:42.976
And I think this is a form of
private propaganda on the part

00:56:42.976 --> 00:56:44.619
of the baker Eurysaces.
 

00:56:44.619 --> 00:56:47.800
What he is telling the public
who gaze up on this tomb,

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.440
not only in his own day but for
posterity,

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:54.510
is: "My bread was always,
not only of high quality,

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:56.409
but of the appropriate weight.
 

00:56:56.409 --> 00:56:58.099
I never cheated the public.
 

00:56:58.099 --> 00:56:59.329
I treated you fairly.
 

00:56:59.329 --> 00:57:02.110
I was an honest baker and
contractor."

00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:04.518
I think that's what the message
is here.

00:57:04.518 --> 00:57:07.153
And, in fact,
you may think this is a

00:57:07.153 --> 00:57:10.181
stretch,
but I think that one could

00:57:10.181 --> 00:57:14.967
easily compare this report that
Eurysaces provides of his

00:57:14.967 --> 00:57:19.838
profession on the frieze of this
tomb as a kind of baker's

00:57:19.838 --> 00:57:23.599
version of Augustus' Res
Gestae.

00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:28.474
The list of things accomplished
during his life is laid out in

00:57:28.474 --> 00:57:32.152
narrative form,
for not only his contemporaries

00:57:32.152 --> 00:57:34.469
but for posterity to see.
 

00:57:34.469 --> 00:57:37.786
The portrait group again--and I
mentioned that there was an

00:57:37.786 --> 00:57:40.360
inscription found with that
portrait group;

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:44.385
a very interesting inscription
which tells us that Eurysaces

00:57:44.385 --> 00:57:47.389
put up this monument to his wife
Atistia,

00:57:47.389 --> 00:57:50.860
and Atistia's bodily remains,
he says,

00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:55.309
are buried in hoc
panario--in hoc

00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:58.639
panario,
in this panarium.

00:57:58.639 --> 00:57:59.579
What is a panarium?
 

00:57:59.579 --> 00:58:02.259
A breadbasket;
which is again why scholars

00:58:02.259 --> 00:58:04.851
have said, "Well the whole
tomb is in the form of an

00:58:04.851 --> 00:58:05.500
oven."
 

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:08.931
But I think the breadbasket
being referred to here is not

00:58:08.931 --> 00:58:12.545
the tomb, but rather the urn in
which Atistia's remains were

00:58:12.545 --> 00:58:13.219
placed.
 

00:58:13.219 --> 00:58:15.119
In the excavation in the
nineteenth century,

00:58:15.119 --> 00:58:17.730
when that later gateway was
removed,

00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:21.949
they found one urn,
one urn, not two urns,

00:58:21.949 --> 00:58:25.460
one urn, presumably the urn of
Atistia,

00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:29.719
and that urn was in the
form--it was drawn at that time.

00:58:29.719 --> 00:58:33.432
And we can see this view of it
here, a cross-section,

00:58:33.432 --> 00:58:36.289
the lid, and the main body of
the urn.

00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:39.440
And you can see it looks like a
breadbasket.

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.987
And I show you--we have lots of
examples of urns in the form of

00:58:42.987 --> 00:58:44.820
breadbaskets from Roman times.
 

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:46.409
There's one in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art,

00:58:46.409 --> 00:58:48.947
and any of you who are going
down there anytime soon to look

00:58:48.947 --> 00:58:50.710
at Roman antiquities and other
things,

00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:51.969
you can see one there.
 

00:58:51.969 --> 00:58:54.139
This one is in the National
Museum in Rome.

00:58:54.139 --> 00:58:58.487
And women's remains were often
placed in breadbaskets to

00:58:58.487 --> 00:59:02.599
accentuate or to speak to their
domestic virtues,

00:59:02.599 --> 00:59:05.719
if they were good at taking
care of the house and baking

00:59:05.719 --> 00:59:06.739
bread and so on.
 

00:59:06.739 --> 00:59:10.456
But in this particular case I
think it is much more likely

00:59:10.456 --> 00:59:13.130
that the reference here is not
to her,

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:17.650
to Atistia's cleverness as a
housekeeper,

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:23.000
but rather to her husband's
profession,

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.938
which is very,
very interesting in terms of

00:59:24.938 --> 00:59:27.480
what it tells us about the
gender wars of antiquity,

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.909
that here's a tomb that has
been put up by this baker,

00:59:30.909 --> 00:59:33.329
with his money that he's made
from his profession,

00:59:33.329 --> 00:59:35.630
in honor of his wife.
 

00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:39.885
But what he depicts -- what he
is preserving for posterity is

00:59:39.885 --> 00:59:42.579
not the outline of his wife's
life,

00:59:42.579 --> 00:59:45.599
but the outline of his life,
what he has accomplished.

00:59:45.599 --> 00:59:48.400
His name is plastered on three
sides of the monument.

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.891
He's got three sides of the
monument with the successive

00:59:51.891 --> 00:59:55.320
phases of the baking of bread in
all of its aspects.

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:58.237
Yes, he has a very nice
portrait relief of his wife,

00:59:58.237 --> 01:00:00.639
but of course he's standing by
her side.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:02.369
And he does mention her name
down below.

01:00:02.369 --> 01:00:04.059
So he gives her some due.
 

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:05.938
But this monument,
as far as posterity is

01:00:05.938 --> 01:00:08.822
concerned,
is about Eurysaces and not

01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:11.726
about his wife,
and I think it tells us again

01:00:11.726 --> 01:00:14.114
very--
a great deal about the motives

01:00:14.114 --> 01:00:16.230
of this particular individual.
 

01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:20.793
I want to say just a very few
words about two other tombs out

01:00:20.793 --> 01:00:24.518
on the Via Appia in Rome,
the Appian Way again.

01:00:24.518 --> 01:00:27.840
And I show you a view of the
Via Appia, as it looks today.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.097
You can see that although much
of the road is modern,

01:00:31.097 --> 01:00:34.730
you do find bits and pieces of
ancient ground out there.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:38.103
You can see some polygonal
blocks here and some rut marks

01:00:38.103 --> 01:00:41.199
from the ancient road,
and you have to be very careful

01:00:41.199 --> 01:00:43.610
when you drive out there in your
Cinquecento,

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:46.110
or whatever--or you bike ride
out there,

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:48.898
as this fellow is doing,
or you take your motorbike or

01:00:48.898 --> 01:00:51.193
whatever--
because if you're going too

01:00:51.193 --> 01:00:54.597
quickly and you don't expect it,
all of a sudden you hit some

01:00:54.597 --> 01:00:56.695
ancient road,
and that makes a huge

01:00:56.695 --> 01:01:00.219
difference in terms of your
ability to move forward.

01:01:00.219 --> 01:01:02.773
I want to show you one tomb,
very fleetingly,

01:01:02.773 --> 01:01:06.023
out there, which is the one
that you see over here on the

01:01:06.023 --> 01:01:07.940
left-hand side of the screen.
 

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.949
There are remains of many tombs
on the Via Appia.

01:01:09.949 --> 01:01:12.523
Most of them are just piles of
concrete, but a few of them are

01:01:12.523 --> 01:01:14.380
better preserved,
and this is one of them.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:20.329
It's a tomb of freedmen and
freedwomen from 13 B.C.

01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:21.909
to A.D. 5.
 

01:01:21.909 --> 01:01:25.429
We call it the Rabirius Tomb
because of an inscription that

01:01:25.429 --> 01:01:29.010
tells us members of the Rabirius
family were buried here.

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:32.550
The reason that I show it to
you is that the eccentric tombs

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:36.210
that I've shown you today are
absolutely marvelous and tell us

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:39.210
a lot about the Romans as
patrons and their desires

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:41.010
vis-à-vis memory.
 

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:45.050
But it is not--those are not
the conventional tomb types.

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.695
We see many more of this sort
of thing, which we call a house

01:01:47.695 --> 01:01:49.900
tomb, a tomb that resembles a
house essentially.

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:54.920
It has a sloping ceiling and a
main façade,

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.469
and in that façade there
is usually a portrait relief,

01:01:58.469 --> 01:02:02.170
either vertical or horizontal,
but these horizontal ones

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:04.460
represent members of the family.
 

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:07.409
Some may be deceased,
some may not be deceased.

01:02:07.409 --> 01:02:10.579
The message is that even if
someone has died before another,

01:02:10.579 --> 01:02:13.213
that they will eventually be
re-united together in

01:02:13.213 --> 01:02:14.018
perpetuity.
 

01:02:14.018 --> 01:02:15.670
But if you look at this
carefully,

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:19.672
you will see that what it looks
like is as if these individuals

01:02:19.672 --> 01:02:23.739
are still alive and looking out
of the window of their tomb,

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:26.800
as if out of the window of a
house;

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:30.521
this very close association in
the minds of the Romans between

01:02:30.521 --> 01:02:33.329
houses of the living and houses
of the dead.

01:02:33.329 --> 01:02:36.000
And that is absolutely the case
here.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.438
And you'll remember,
we can trace this all the way

01:02:38.438 --> 01:02:40.079
back to the eighth century B.C.
 

01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:43.900
You remember the Villanovan hut
urn that I showed you,

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:46.699
and I told you that women's
remains were placed in--

01:02:46.699 --> 01:02:51.181
women's cremated remains--were
placed in these huts that

01:02:51.181 --> 01:02:53.300
resembled Romulus' huts.
 

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:57.208
And so this whole idea of a
house serving as a tomb goes way

01:02:57.208 --> 01:03:00.347
back,
and continues to be a leitmotif

01:03:00.347 --> 01:03:05.224
of Roman tomb architecture
throughout the entire history of

01:03:05.224 --> 01:03:08.677
Roman architecture,
and it's something that I hope

01:03:08.677 --> 01:03:09.739
you'll keep in mind.
 

01:03:09.739 --> 01:03:12.460
Also just in passing,
I want to mention--

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:15.114
we've looked--the tombs that
we've looked at thus far today

01:03:15.114 --> 01:03:17.576
have been--
they've been of all different

01:03:17.576 --> 01:03:20.452
social classes,
from emperor to freed slave,

01:03:20.452 --> 01:03:23.510
but at the same time they have
all been tombs,

01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:26.340
including the Rabirius Tomb,
of the well-to-do.

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.806
If these were freed slaves,
they were ones that made a

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:30.864
fortune,
like Eurysaces did selling

01:03:30.864 --> 01:03:34.043
bread to the Roman army,
and with that fortune were able

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:36.699
to build monumental tombs,
at great expense.

01:03:36.699 --> 01:03:39.030
But there were lots and lots of
people obviously,

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:42.092
who lived in Rome and Pompeii
and in other cities who could

01:03:42.092 --> 01:03:44.840
not afford those kinds of tombs,
and you might be asking

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.487
yourselves,
"Where are all of those

01:03:46.487 --> 01:03:47.340
people buried?"
 

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:49.619
Well they tended to be buried
underground,

01:03:49.619 --> 01:03:52.371
in what we call
columbaria --

01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:56.248
c-o-l-u-m-b-a-r-i-a,
columbaria--underground

01:03:56.248 --> 01:04:00.315
burial chambers,
that were either burial clubs

01:04:00.315 --> 01:04:05.090
that you could join for a small
amount of money;

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:08.730
you could join one of these
clubs, buy into your last

01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:10.480
resting place that way.
 

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.846
Or they were burial chambers
that were created by the very

01:04:13.846 --> 01:04:16.681
well to do, for example,
the emperor and empress,

01:04:16.681 --> 01:04:18.039
Augustus and Livia.
 

01:04:18.039 --> 01:04:21.250
We know they had thousands of
slaves, literally thousands of

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:21.739
slaves.
 

01:04:21.739 --> 01:04:24.079
We have a record of some of
Livia's slaves.

01:04:24.079 --> 01:04:26.393
She had slaves,
not only to tend the garden and

01:04:26.393 --> 01:04:28.764
that kind of thing,
but she had a masseuse,

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:31.842
she had several hairstylists,
and she even had a slave,

01:04:31.842 --> 01:04:34.971
we know, who set her pearls,
that was her whole job was to

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:37.219
set her pearls,
day in and day out.

01:04:37.219 --> 01:04:39.099
So they had tons and tons of
slaves,

01:04:39.099 --> 01:04:43.163
and some of those very well to
do also established these burial

01:04:43.163 --> 01:04:47.030
areas where their slaves could
find a last resting place.

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:51.030
And, in fact,
the one that I show you here,

01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:52.800
the Vigna Codini,
is one such,

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.856
that belonged to the
Augustan-Julio-Claudian family

01:04:55.856 --> 01:04:59.340
and was used for the remains of
some of their slaves.

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:01.849
And you can see that each
individual had a little niche;

01:05:01.849 --> 01:05:03.190
again, people were cremated.
 

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:06.940
The cremated remains were
placed usually in an urn,

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.949
that was placed inside one of
these niches,

01:05:08.949 --> 01:05:10.980
and then there would be a small
inscription,

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:14.219
referring to the deceased.
 

01:05:14.219 --> 01:05:17.300
So this gives you a sense again
of those who could not afford

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.559
individual tombs and how they
were buried.

01:05:19.559 --> 01:05:23.280
In the five or seven minutes
that remain,

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.902
I'd like to switch gears
entirely and look at something

01:05:26.902 --> 01:05:30.476
very different,
as a prelude to what we'll be

01:05:30.476 --> 01:05:33.565
talking about next time,
because next time,

01:05:33.565 --> 01:05:35.713
next Tuesday,
we are going to return once

01:05:35.713 --> 01:05:37.969
again to innovative Roman
architecture;

01:05:37.969 --> 01:05:42.456
architecture made of concrete
and with a variety of

01:05:42.456 --> 01:05:44.789
interesting innovations.
 

01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:47.280
We'll do that next week,
as I said.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.898
And I want to give you an
introduction to that by turning

01:05:50.898 --> 01:05:54.195
to this one example from the
Augustan period that is

01:05:54.195 --> 01:05:57.750
noteworthy enough for us to say
something about it.

01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:03.146
What you're looking at here is
the plan of what was a spa

01:06:03.146 --> 01:06:06.809
essentially, in ancient Roman
times.

01:06:06.809 --> 01:06:09.918
It's located in Campania,
at a place called Baia,

01:06:09.918 --> 01:06:13.869
so in the vicinity of Pompeii
and Herculaneum and Oplontis and

01:06:13.869 --> 01:06:15.619
Boscotrecase and so on.
 

01:06:15.619 --> 01:06:18.958
We've already talked about the
fact that that was an area that

01:06:18.958 --> 01:06:22.141
was a mecca for the well-to-do,
the glitteratti from Rome who

01:06:22.141 --> 01:06:23.829
went down there for their
vacations.

01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:25.280
It was a resort area.
 

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:28.429
Many of them had villas along
what is now the Amalfi Coast.

01:06:28.429 --> 01:06:31.389
Others had villas on the Island
of Capri.

01:06:31.389 --> 01:06:34.480
I can't remember if I told you
but Augustus and Tiberius,

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.797
his successor,
owned twelve villas on the

01:06:36.797 --> 01:06:39.726
Island of Capri,
one of which we'll look at next

01:06:39.726 --> 01:06:40.079
time.
 

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:43.882
And this was an area also where
there were sulfur springs and

01:06:43.882 --> 01:06:46.639
mineral baths,
and so the natural thing to do,

01:06:46.639 --> 01:06:49.083
for those who were coming here,
as a resort,

01:06:49.083 --> 01:06:52.405
was to create for them a place
that they could go to relax and

01:06:52.405 --> 01:06:55.617
enjoy the thermal springs and
the sulfur baths and so on and

01:06:55.617 --> 01:06:58.507
so fort,
and that was this place,

01:06:58.507 --> 01:07:02.496
this spa, at Baia,
which consisted of a bunch of

01:07:02.496 --> 01:07:07.010
thermal structures that were
terraced out over a hillside.

01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:10.266
You have to think of the
Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia

01:07:10.266 --> 01:07:12.340
at Palestrina,
turned into a spa.

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.518
Because they treated
it--architecturally it was done

01:07:14.518 --> 01:07:15.630
in exactly the same way.
 

01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:17.768
They took a hillside,
they terraced that hillside,

01:07:17.768 --> 01:07:19.969
they poured concrete on that
hillside,

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:24.329
creating a whole host of
interesting structures in which

01:07:24.329 --> 01:07:27.739
one could relax and get away
from it all.

01:07:27.739 --> 01:07:31.239
You see a plan of that spa here
and the way in which it was

01:07:31.239 --> 01:07:33.351
terraced, via concrete
construction,

01:07:33.351 --> 01:07:34.739
over this hillside.
 

01:07:34.739 --> 01:07:38.771
I am only going to show you one
thermal bath from it,

01:07:38.771 --> 01:07:42.030
and it's this one that we see
over here.

01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:43.820
It is the so-called
"Temple of Mercury"

01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.610
-- that's what the locals have
long called it.

01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:48.286
It is not a Temple of Mercury,
it is a thermal bath,

01:07:48.286 --> 01:07:51.436
but nonetheless we call it that
because it's been called that

01:07:51.436 --> 01:07:52.750
for such a long time.
 

01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:55.909
As you look at the plan of the
Temple of Mercury,

01:07:55.909 --> 01:07:58.083
you're going to say to
me--every one of you will say

01:07:58.083 --> 01:07:59.869
the same thing,
"What's the origin of

01:07:59.869 --> 01:08:00.340
this?"
 

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:04.152
Clearly the design is based on
the frigidaria of

01:08:04.152 --> 01:08:06.686
Pompeii,
the frigidarium or the

01:08:06.686 --> 01:08:10.213
cold room of Pompeii,
this round structure with the

01:08:10.213 --> 01:08:14.773
radiating alcoves that we saw as
part of bath architecture very

01:08:14.773 --> 01:08:17.060
early on,
second century B.C.,

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.590
and so on, in Pompeii.
 

01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:20.720
Same scheme used here.
 

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.609
Not surprising.
 

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:23.510
This is in Campania,
it's not far away.

01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:27.145
I can show you the Temple of
Mercury is extremely well

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:27.970
preserved.
 

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:30.962
We can see the dome of the
Temple of Mercury,

01:08:30.962 --> 01:08:33.208
made out of concrete
construction,

01:08:33.208 --> 01:08:34.229
from above.
 

01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:37.210
You can see the oculus
of the--

01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:40.140
just as those frigidaria
had oculi,

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:45.323
this one does as well,
and you can see that extremely

01:08:45.323 --> 01:08:46.520
well here.
 

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.877
So a concrete building,
with a concrete dome,

01:08:49.877 --> 01:08:51.939
used as part of this spa.
 

01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:57.608
We've traced this desire to
make round structures way back

01:08:57.608 --> 01:09:02.578
to the 600s B.C.,
the time of Quinto Fiorentino.

01:09:02.578 --> 01:09:06.427
I showed you this Etruscan
attempt at making a round

01:09:06.427 --> 01:09:08.524
structure,
with a dome,

01:09:08.524 --> 01:09:11.310
that was done,
in this case,

01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:14.340
in stone, and although it was a
valiant attempt,

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.038
not all that successful.
 

01:09:16.038 --> 01:09:19.640
And we talked about the way in
which that eventually

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.819
transformed into the Roman
ability to make the

01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:25.149
frigidaria at Pompeii.
 

01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:28.890
And here are two views of the
Temple of Mercury at Baia,

01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:30.250
as it looks today.
 

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:33.149
Because of the oculus,
there is often rain water.

01:09:33.149 --> 01:09:34.970
The drain no longer functions.
 

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:40.971
So there's often a lot of very
unappealing green water that

01:09:40.971 --> 01:09:46.250
accumulates in the base of the
Temple of Mercury.

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:48.954
So the times that I've been
there, every time I think I've

01:09:48.954 --> 01:09:50.823
been there,
there's been enough water in

01:09:50.823 --> 01:09:53.444
there that I haven't been able
to actually get pictures of the

01:09:53.444 --> 01:09:55.497
alcoves,
which are covered by these

01:09:55.497 --> 01:09:59.226
inches and inches of water that
are usually collected inside the

01:09:59.226 --> 01:10:00.470
Temple of Mercury.
 

01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:02.399
But you get a good sense,
I think,

01:10:02.399 --> 01:10:04.604
of it here nonetheless,
that we're talking about a

01:10:04.604 --> 01:10:07.322
round domed structure,
with an oculus,

01:10:07.322 --> 01:10:10.515
with some windows,
with arcuated windows,

01:10:10.515 --> 01:10:13.448
windows with arcuations at the
top,

01:10:13.448 --> 01:10:16.743
in the uppermost part,
or toward the uppermost part of

01:10:16.743 --> 01:10:20.654
the dome,
to add additional light into

01:10:20.654 --> 01:10:22.010
the system.
 

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:24.630
And you need to think of these,
by the way, as much more ornate

01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:26.109
in antiquity than they are
today.

01:10:26.109 --> 01:10:29.429
They would have been stuccoed
over, which you can see,

01:10:29.429 --> 01:10:32.060
and then probably decorated
with mosaic.

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.658
So the wonderful effects of the
light coming in,

01:10:34.658 --> 01:10:37.344
hitting the mosaic,
and then there would've been a

01:10:37.344 --> 01:10:39.435
pool in the center,
just as there was in the

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:42.600
frigidarium,
around which people could sit.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.899
It would've been a quite
spectacular space.

01:10:46.899 --> 01:10:50.340
And just a few more views,
to end with today.

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.386
This one up here,
which of course is the

01:10:52.386 --> 01:10:55.481
frigidarium at Pompeii,
to show you where all of this

01:10:55.481 --> 01:10:56.060
begins.
 

01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:00.779
These two views are of the
Temple of Mercury at Baia.

01:11:00.779 --> 01:11:02.521
And this one,
of course, of the Pantheon,

01:11:02.521 --> 01:11:03.828
which is where we're headed.
 

01:11:03.828 --> 01:11:07.652
But I think these in particular
of the Temple of Mercury at Baia

01:11:07.652 --> 01:11:11.050
again give you a sense of the
way in which light not only

01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:14.613
flows into this system--
again, imagine it on mosaic

01:11:14.613 --> 01:11:17.676
ceiling and mosaic walls;
spectacular effects,

01:11:17.676 --> 01:11:20.590
the way it would have glittered
in the light.

01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:24.672
But look especially at the way
the shapes that are formed on

01:11:24.672 --> 01:11:28.550
the water that would have been
in the pool down below.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:32.837
It's exactly the same sort of
sense that you get when you walk

01:11:32.837 --> 01:11:36.702
into the Pantheon today,
which also makes circles on the

01:11:36.702 --> 01:11:38.529
floor of the pavement.
 

01:11:38.529 --> 01:11:41.247
So we're going to again return
to these kinds of issues next

01:11:41.247 --> 01:11:41.569
week.
 

01:11:41.569 --> 01:11:44.753
I just wanted you to be aware
of this intermediate step

01:11:44.753 --> 01:11:47.997
between the frigidaria of
Pompeii and some of the

01:11:47.997 --> 01:11:51.771
buildings that we're going to be
looking at in the next couple of

01:11:51.771 --> 01:11:52.479
weeks.
 

01:11:52.479 --> 01:11:53.828
Take care.
 

01:11:53.828 --> 01:11:55.420
Thank you, and Happy
Valentine's Day.

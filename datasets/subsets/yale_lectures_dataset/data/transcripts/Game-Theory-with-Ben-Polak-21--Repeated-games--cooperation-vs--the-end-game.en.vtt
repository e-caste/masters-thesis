00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.740
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, let's make a start.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.710
So I hope everyone had a good
break.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:15.570
We're going to spend this week
looking at repeated interaction.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.322
We already saw last time,
before the break,

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:32.310
that once we repeat games--once
games go on for a while--we can

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.270
sustain behavior that's quite
interesting.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.424
So, for example,
before the break,

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:41.145
we saw that we could sustain
fighting by players that were

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:45.469
rational in a war of attrition.
Another thing we learned before

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.088
the break is when we're
analyzing these potentially very

00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:51.643
long games,
it helps sometimes to break the

00:00:51.643 --> 00:00:54.330
analysis up into what we might
call "stage games,"

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.611
each period of the game,
and break the payoffs up into:

00:00:57.611 --> 00:01:00.649
the payoffs that are associated
with that stage;

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.862
payoffs that are associated
with the past (they're sunk,

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:06.357
so they doesn't really matter);
and payoffs that are going to

00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:10.019
come in the future from future
equilibrium play.

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:13.006
So those are some ideas we're
going to pick up today,

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:16.049
but for the most part what we
do today will be new.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.281
Now whereas last time we
focused on fighting,

00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:20.968
for the whole of today I want
to focus on the issue of

00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:24.376
cooperation.
In fact, for the whole of this

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:28.790
week, I want to focus on the
issue of cooperation.

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:36.428
The question behind everything
this week is going to be:

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:38.970
can repeated interaction among
players,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.238
both induce and sustain
cooperative behavior,

00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:47.004
or if you like "good behavior."
Our canonical example is going

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:50.480
to be Prisoners' Dilemma.
Way back in the very first

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.799
class, we talked about
Prisoners' Dilemma,

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.023
and we mentioned that playing
the game repeatedly might be

00:01:56.023 --> 00:01:58.230
able to get us out of the
dilemma.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.019
It might be able to enable us
to sustain cooperation.

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:05.642
And what's going to be good
about that is not just sustained

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:09.080
cooperation, but sustained
cooperation without the use of

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.089
outside payments such as
contracts or the mafia or

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.530
whatever.
So why does this matter?

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.575
Well one reason it matters is
that most interactions in

00:02:19.575 --> 00:02:24.370
society, either don't or perhaps
even can't rely on contracts.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.310
Most relationships are not
contractual.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.340
However, many relationships are
repeated.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.394
So this is going to be of more
importance perhaps in general

00:02:34.394 --> 00:02:37.396
life--though perhaps less so in
business--more important in

00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:39.830
general life than thinking about
contracts.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.655
So let's think about some
obvious examples,

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:45.009
think about your own
friendships.

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:46.987
I don't know if you have any
friendships--I assume you

00:02:46.987 --> 00:02:49.263
do--but for those of you who do
your friendships are typically

00:02:49.263 --> 00:02:50.963
not contractual.
You don't have a contract that

00:02:50.963 --> 00:02:52.490
says if you're nice to me,
I'll be nice to you.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.750
Similarly, think about
interactions among nations.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.246
Interactions among nations
typically cannot be contractual

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:02.251
because there's no court to
enforce those would-be

00:03:02.251 --> 00:03:04.302
contracts,
although you can have treaties

00:03:04.302 --> 00:03:06.541
I suppose.
But most interactions among

00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:10.410
nations--cooperation among
nations is sustained by the fact

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.879
that those relationships are
going to go forever.

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.024
Even in business,
even where we have contracts,

00:03:17.024 --> 00:03:20.580
and even in a very litigious
society like the U.S.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.114
which is probably the most
litigious society in the world,

00:03:24.114 --> 00:03:27.463
we can't really rely on
contracts for everyday business

00:03:27.463 --> 00:03:29.732
relationships.
So, in some sense,

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:33.508
we need a way to model a way to
sustain cooperation and good

00:03:33.508 --> 00:03:35.734
behavior that forms,
if you like,

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:38.940
the social fabric of our
society and prevents always

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.871
going to court about everything.
Now, why might repeated

00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:47.546
interaction work?
Why do we think way back in day

00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:50.421
one of the class that repeated
interaction might be able to

00:03:50.421 --> 00:03:53.168
enable us to behave well,
even in situations like

00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:56.061
Prisoner's Dilemma's or
situations involving moral

00:03:56.061 --> 00:03:59.250
hazard where bad behavior is
going to occur in one shot

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.202
games?
So the lesson we're going to be

00:04:02.202 --> 00:04:06.509
sort of underlying things today
and all week is this one.

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:26.522
In ongoing relationships the
promise of future rewards and

00:04:26.522 --> 00:04:46.887
the threat of future punishments
may--let's be careful--may

00:04:46.887 --> 00:05:06.900
sometimes provide incentives for
good behavior today.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.893
Just leave a gap here in your
notes because we're going to

00:05:14.893 --> 00:05:17.160
come back to this.
So this is a very general idea.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.103
And the idea is that future
behavior in the relationship can

00:05:21.103 --> 00:05:24.780
generate the possibility of
future rewards and/or future

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.559
punishments,
and those promises or threats

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:31.449
may sometimes provide incentives
for people to behave well today.

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.927
The reason I want to leave a
gap here is I want--part of the

00:05:34.927 --> 00:05:38.699
purpose of this week's lectures
is to try and get beyond this.

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.108
This is kind of,
almost a platitude,

00:05:40.108 --> 00:05:41.500
right?
Most of you knew this already.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.392
So I want to get beyond this.
I want to see when is this

00:05:45.392 --> 00:05:48.080
going to work?
When is it not going to work?

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.027
How is it going to work?
So I don't want people to leave

00:05:52.027 --> 00:05:53.589
this week of classes or leave
the course thinking:

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:56.151
oh well,
we're going to interact more

00:05:56.151 --> 00:05:59.949
than once so everything's fine.
That's not true.

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.744
I want to make sure we
understand when things work,

00:06:02.744 --> 00:06:04.701
how they work,
and more importantly,

00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:07.439
when they don't work and how
they don't work.

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:10.954
So we're going to try and fill
in the gap that we just left on

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:13.522
that board as we go on today.
Nevertheless,

00:06:13.522 --> 00:06:16.534
we do have this very strong
intuition that repeated

00:06:16.534 --> 00:06:19.304
interaction will get us,
as it were, out of the

00:06:19.304 --> 00:06:22.105
Prisoner's Dilemma.
So why don't we start with the

00:06:22.105 --> 00:06:25.356
Prisoner's Dilemma.
I'll put this up out of the way

00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:28.965
and we'll come back to it.
Let's just remind ourselves

00:06:28.965 --> 00:06:32.560
what the Prisoner's Dilemma is
because you guys are all full of

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.038
turkey and cranberry sauce and
you've probably forgotten what

00:06:36.038 --> 00:06:39.875
Game Theory is entirely.
Let's name these strategies,

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:44.340
rather than alpha and beta,
let's call them cooperation and

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.283
defect.
And that will be our convention

00:06:46.283 --> 00:06:51.318
this week.
We'll call them cooperation and

00:06:51.318 --> 00:06:55.212
defect.
This is Player A and this is

00:06:55.212 --> 00:07:00.520
Player B, and the payoffs are
something like this (2,2),

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.244
(-1,3), (3, -1) and (0,0).
It doesn't have to be exactly

00:07:05.244 --> 00:07:08.227
this but this will do.
This is the game we're going to

00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:10.188
play.
And, to try and see if we get

00:07:10.188 --> 00:07:13.197
cooperation out of it by having
repeated interaction,

00:07:13.197 --> 00:07:15.569
we're going to play it more
than once.

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:22.959
So let me go and find some
players to play here.

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:27.420
This should be a familiar game
to everybody here.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.306
So why don't I pick some people
who are kind of close to the

00:07:29.306 --> 00:07:32.591
front row.
So what's your name again?

00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:36.542
Student: Brooke.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:07:36.542 --> 00:07:38.755
Brooke.
Okay so Brooke is going to be

00:07:38.755 --> 00:07:41.511
Player B.
And I've forgotten your name,

00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:45.632
by this stage I should know it.
Patrick you're going to be

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.854
Player A.
And the difference between

00:07:47.854 --> 00:07:51.137
playing this game now and
playing this game earlier on in

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:54.420
the class is we're going to play
not once, but twice.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.400
We're going to play it twice.
So write down what you're going

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.050
to do the first time and show it
to your neighbor.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:05.330
Don't show it to each other.
And let's find out what they

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.810
did the first time.
So is it written down?

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.090
Something's written down?
So Brooke.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.191
Student: I cooperated.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:12.270
You cooperated.
Patrick?

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.829
Student: I defected.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:08:13.829 --> 00:08:14.389
Patrick defected,
okay.

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:17.199
Okay let's play it a second
time.

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:19.710
So write down what you're going
to do the second time.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.023
Brooke?
Student: This time I'm

00:08:27.023 --> 00:08:29.084
going to defect.
Student: Me too.

00:08:29.084 --> 00:08:31.424
Professor Ben Polak:
All right,

00:08:31.424 --> 00:08:34.522
so we had the play this
time--let's just put it up

00:08:34.522 --> 00:08:38.190
here--so when we played it this
time, we had A and B.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.939
And the first time we had
(defect, cooperate) and the

00:08:41.939 --> 00:08:44.680
second time we had (defect,
defect).

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.961
Let's try another pair.
We'll just play this a couple

00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:49.629
times and we'll talk about it.
So that's fair enough.

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:50.470
Why don't we go to your
neighbors.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.210
That's fair enough. It's easy.
So you are?

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.406
Student: Ben.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:08:54.406 --> 00:08:56.500
That's a good name,
very good okay.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.967
You are? Student: Edwina.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:00.809
Edwina, Edwina and Ben
okay.

00:09:00.809 --> 00:09:04.559
So we're going to make Ben
Player B and Edwina Player A.

00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:06.649
And why don't you write down
what you're going to do for the

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:10.533
first time.
Again, we're going to play it

00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:12.262
twice.
Why don't we mix it up,

00:09:12.262 --> 00:09:14.499
we can play it three times.
We'll play it three times this

00:09:14.499 --> 00:09:16.149
time okay.
We'll play it three times.

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:17.720
Both people are happy with
their decisions.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.530
Okay so the first time Edwina
what did you choose?

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.070
Student: Defect.
Student: Cooperate.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.657
Professor Ben Polak:
All right so we had--let's

00:09:27.657 --> 00:09:31.990
put down this time--so we've got
Edwina will Play A and Ben B.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:40.210
And we had (cooperate, defect).
Second time please, Edwina?

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.669
Student: Cooperate.
Student: Defect.

00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:46.087
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, so we're going to and

00:09:46.087 --> 00:09:50.386
fro now.
So this was cooperate and

00:09:50.386 --> 00:09:56.400
defect and one more time:
write it down.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.850
Both players written down?
Edwina?

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.899
Student: Cooperate.
Student: Defect.

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:02.363
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, so you we flipped

00:10:02.363 --> 00:10:05.159
round again okay.
Okay, so we're seeing some

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:11.230
pretty odd behavior here.
Who did what that time?

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.330
Edwina what did you do?
Student: I cooperated.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.415
Professor Ben Polak: So
we had this.

00:10:15.415 --> 00:10:17.904
Is that right?
So keep the microphones for a

00:10:17.904 --> 00:10:20.649
minute, and we'll just talk
about it a second.

00:10:20.649 --> 00:10:26.779
All right, so first of all
let's start with Ben here.

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:28.860
Ben you were cooperating on the
first go.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.429
So why did you choose to
cooperate the first turn?

00:10:33.429 --> 00:10:37.446
Student: I felt that if
I established a reputation for

00:10:37.446 --> 00:10:40.392
cooperating we could end up in
the cooperate,

00:10:40.392 --> 00:10:42.170
cooperate.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.778
All right,
so you thought that by playing

00:10:43.778 --> 00:10:45.495
cooperate early you could
establish some kind of

00:10:45.495 --> 00:10:47.759
reputation.
And what about later on when

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:51.360
you played defect thereafter,
what were you thinking there?

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.076
Student: I realized that
she established a reputation for

00:10:55.076 --> 00:10:57.386
defecting a second time.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:10:57.386 --> 00:10:58.737
All right,
so you switched strategies

00:10:58.737 --> 00:11:02.029
mid-course.
Edwina you started off by

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:04.216
defecting.
Why did you start off by

00:11:04.216 --> 00:11:05.976
defecting?
Shout it out so people can hear

00:11:05.976 --> 00:11:06.992
you.
Student: Because his

00:11:06.992 --> 00:11:08.360
friend defected so I thought he
might defect.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.399
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, his friend defected.

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:11.659
Okay, so he's been tainted by
his friend there.

00:11:11.659 --> 00:11:13.929
There's a shortage of space in
the class.

00:11:13.929 --> 00:11:15.350
They could have just been
sitting next to each other.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.220
Thereafter you cooperated.
Why was that?

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.649
Student: Because I
thought he cooperated.

00:11:19.649 --> 00:11:20.870
Maybe he was going to keep
cooperating.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.924
Professor Ben Polak:
All right,

00:11:21.924 --> 00:11:23.320
so in fact your reputation
works in some sense.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.481
By cooperating early you
convinced Edwina you would

00:11:25.481 --> 00:11:26.759
cooperate.
And then you went on

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:28.924
cooperating even after he
defected, so what were you doing

00:11:28.924 --> 00:11:31.120
in the third round?
Shout out.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.508
Student: I thought he
might cooperate because I

00:11:34.508 --> 00:11:35.839
cooperated.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:36.600
All right,
he might come back.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.789
Let's talk about it to your
neighbors.

00:11:37.789 --> 00:11:42.580
So Brooke, shout out why you
cooperated in the first round.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.700
Student: Because I was
hopeful that he would cooperate.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.754
Professor Ben Polak:
You were hoping he would

00:11:48.754 --> 00:11:50.445
cooperate all right,
and why did you defect

00:11:50.445 --> 00:11:51.765
thereafter?
Student: Because I

00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:53.340
thought he would continue to
defect after he defected.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.890
Professor Ben Polak:
Because he defected,

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:57.807
he would continue to defect.
Patrick, you're the person who

00:11:57.807 --> 00:12:01.770
just defected throughout here.
Grab the mic that's next to you.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.274
Why did you just defect?
Student: It's such a

00:12:04.274 --> 00:12:07.491
short game that it makes sense
to defect in the last period so

00:12:07.491 --> 00:12:09.970
the second last period and the
first period.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.253
Professor Ben Polak:
All right,

00:12:11.253 --> 00:12:13.807
that's an interesting idea.
So Patrick's saying,

00:12:13.807 --> 00:12:17.751
actually if we look at the last
period of this game,

00:12:17.751 --> 00:12:21.309
if we look at this last period
of the game,

00:12:21.309 --> 00:12:23.240
what does the game look like in
the last period?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.500
Student: It's a single
period game.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.271
Professor Ben Polak:
In the last period,

00:12:27.271 --> 00:12:29.784
this actually is the game.
If I drew out the game with two

00:12:29.784 --> 00:12:32.050
periods, it would be kind of a
hard thing to draw,

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.039
it would be an annoying diagram
to draw.

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:36.961
But in the last period of the
game, whatever happened in the

00:12:36.961 --> 00:12:39.809
first period is what?
It's sunk, is that right?

00:12:39.809 --> 00:12:41.389
Everything that happened in the
first period is sunk.

00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:45.844
So in the last period of the
game these are the only relevant

00:12:45.844 --> 00:12:48.925
payoffs, is that right?
Since these are the only

00:12:48.925 --> 00:12:51.682
relevant payoffs looking
forward, in the last period of

00:12:51.682 --> 00:12:54.899
the game, we know that there's
actually a dominant strategy.

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.847
And what is that dominant
strategy in the last period of

00:12:57.847 --> 00:12:59.080
the game?
To do what?

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.460
In Prisoner's Dilemma,
what's the dominant strategy?

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.559
Shout it out.
Defect, okay.

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:07.927
So what we should see in this
game--we didn't actually because

00:13:07.927 --> 00:13:12.223
we had some kindness over here
from Edwina but what we should

00:13:12.223 --> 00:13:17.019
see in general--is we know that
in the last period of the game,

00:13:17.019 --> 00:13:21.812
in period two,
we're going to get both people

00:13:21.812 --> 00:13:24.534
defecting.
The reason we're going to get

00:13:24.534 --> 00:13:27.559
both people defecting is because
the last period of the game is

00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:30.165
just a one shot game.
There's nothing particularly

00:13:30.165 --> 00:13:32.448
exciting about it.
There is no tomorrow,

00:13:32.448 --> 00:13:34.629
and so people are going to
defect.

00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:38.310
But now let's go back and
revisit some of the arguments

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.743
that Edwina, Brooke,
and--I've forgotten what your

00:13:41.743 --> 00:13:44.943
neighbor is called again,
Ben, (I should remember

00:13:44.943 --> 00:13:48.182
that)--and Ben said earlier.
They gave quite elaborate

00:13:48.182 --> 00:13:50.433
reasons for cooperating:
cooperating to establish

00:13:50.433 --> 00:13:52.576
reputation;
cooperating because the other

00:13:52.576 --> 00:13:54.320
person might cooperate;
whatever.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.295
But most of these behaviors
were designed to either induce

00:13:59.295 --> 00:14:04.009
or promise cooperation in period
two, is that right?

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:06.710
What we've just argued is that
in period two everyone's going

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.166
to defect.
Period two is just a trivial

00:14:09.166 --> 00:14:12.365
one stage Prisoner's Dilemma.
We actually analyzed it in the

00:14:12.365 --> 00:14:14.803
very first week of the class.
And provided we believe these

00:14:14.803 --> 00:14:17.232
payoffs, we're done.
Period two people are going to

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:19.579
defect.
Since they're going to defect

00:14:19.579 --> 00:14:22.536
in period two,
nothing I can do in period one

00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:26.636
is going to affect that behavior
and therefore I should defect

00:14:26.636 --> 00:14:30.877
also in period one.
In order to belabor this point,

00:14:30.877 --> 00:14:35.878
we can actually draw up what
the matrix looks like in period

00:14:35.878 --> 00:14:40.878
one--so let's do that--using the
style we did last week--two

00:14:40.878 --> 00:14:45.839
weeks ago--before we went away.
So here once again is the

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:49.810
matrix we had before,
and I want to analyze the first

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.945
stage game.
In the first stage game,

00:14:51.945 --> 00:14:54.518
what I'm going to do is I'm
going to add in the payoffs I'm

00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:57.029
going to get from tomorrow.
The payoffs I'm going to get

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:59.009
from tomorrow are from
tomorrow's equilibrium.

00:14:59.009 --> 00:15:02.152
Well this isn't going to do
very much for me as we'll see

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:05.407
because I'll get 2 + 0 tomorrow
because we know I'm playing

00:15:05.407 --> 00:15:09.239
defect tomorrow,
2 + 0 tomorrow,

00:15:09.239 --> 00:15:15.018
- 1 + 0 tomorrow,
3 + 0 tomorrow,

00:15:15.018 --> 00:15:21.519
3 + 0 tomorrow,
- 1 + 0 tomorrow,

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:28.049
and 0 + 0 tomorrow,
0 + 0 tomorrow.

00:15:28.049 --> 00:15:30.291
So just as we did with the war
of attrition game two weeks ago,

00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:31.809
we can put in the payoffs from
tomorrow,

00:15:31.809 --> 00:15:33.966
we can roll back those
equilibrium payoffs to today,

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:36.377
it's just in this particular
exercise it's rather a boring

00:15:36.377 --> 00:15:39.107
thing,
because we're just adding 0 to

00:15:39.107 --> 00:15:41.491
everything.
When I add 0 to everything,

00:15:41.491 --> 00:15:44.306
I then just cancel out the
zeros and I'm back where I

00:15:44.306 --> 00:15:46.580
started, and of course I should
defect.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.396
So what I'm going to see is
because I'm going to defect

00:15:49.396 --> 00:15:51.743
anyway tomorrow,
today is just like a one shot

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:55.512
game as well.
And I'm going to get defect

00:15:55.512 --> 00:15:57.712
again.
Now here we played the game

00:15:57.712 --> 00:16:00.509
twice and got defect,
defect, what about if we played

00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:03.370
the game three times?
It's the same thing.

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.313
We didn't play three times but
we did play the game three times

00:16:06.313 --> 00:16:08.874
between Edwina and Ben.
There we know we're going to

00:16:08.874 --> 00:16:11.595
defect in the third round.
Therefore we may as well defect

00:16:11.595 --> 00:16:14.608
in the second to last round.
Therefore we may as well defect

00:16:14.608 --> 00:16:16.866
in the first round.
If we played it five times,

00:16:16.866 --> 00:16:19.179
we know we're going to all
defect in the fifth round.

00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:21.679
Therefore we may as well defect
in the fourth round.

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:23.581
Therefore we may as well defect
in the third,

00:16:23.581 --> 00:16:25.377
and so on.
If we played it 500 times,

00:16:25.377 --> 00:16:28.227
we wouldn't have time in the
class, but if we played it 500

00:16:28.227 --> 00:16:30.139
times,
we know in that 500th period

00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:32.919
it's a one shot game and people
are going to defect.

00:16:32.919 --> 00:16:36.532
And therefore,
in the 499th period people are

00:16:36.532 --> 00:16:38.764
going to defect.
And therefore in the 498th

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:40.100
period people are going to
defect, and so on.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.593
So the problem here is that we
get unraveling,

00:16:43.593 --> 00:16:48.172
something we've seen before in
this class, we get unraveling

00:16:48.172 --> 00:16:50.734
from the back.
I have a worry that there might

00:16:50.734 --> 00:16:52.799
only be one L in unraveling in
America, is that right?

00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:55.659
How many L's do we put in
unraveling in America?

00:16:55.659 --> 00:16:57.791
One, I've just come back from
England and my spelling is

00:16:57.791 --> 00:16:59.420
somewhere in the mid-Atlantic
right now.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:04.231
I'll leave it as one.
All right: unraveling from the

00:17:04.231 --> 00:17:05.925
back.
Essentially this is a backward

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:07.615
induction argument,
only instead of using backward

00:17:07.615 --> 00:17:09.410
induction we're really using
sub-game perfection.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.458
We're looking at the equilibria
in the last games and as we roll

00:17:13.458 --> 00:17:15.900
back up the game,
we get unraveling.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.893
So here's bad news.
The bad news is,

00:17:19.893 --> 00:17:22.699
we'd hoped that by having
repeated interaction in the

00:17:22.699 --> 00:17:25.182
Prisoners' Dilemma,
we would be able to sustain

00:17:25.182 --> 00:17:27.299
cooperation.
That's been our hope since day

00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:29.344
one of the class.
In fact, we stated it kind of

00:17:29.344 --> 00:17:31.902
confidently in the first day of
the class, and we kind of

00:17:31.902 --> 00:17:34.922
intuitively believe it.
But what we're discovering is,

00:17:34.922 --> 00:17:38.650
even if you played this game
for 500 times and then stopped,

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.958
you wouldn't be able to sustain
cooperation in equilibrium

00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:45.325
because we're going to get
unraveling in the last stage and

00:17:45.325 --> 00:17:48.460
so on and so forth.
So it seems like our big hope

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.371
that repeated interaction would
induce cooperation in society is

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:55.700
going down the plug hole.
That's bad.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:03.369
So let's come back and modify
our lesson a little bit.

00:18:03.369 --> 00:18:07.012
So what went wrong here was,
in the last period of the game,

00:18:07.012 --> 00:18:10.099
there was no incentives
generated by the future,

00:18:10.099 --> 00:18:13.297
so there was no promise of
future rewards or future

00:18:13.297 --> 00:18:16.943
punishments, and therefore
cooperation broke down and then

00:18:16.943 --> 00:18:22.150
we had unraveling.
So the lesson here is what?

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:34.176
The lesson is:
but for this to work it helps

00:18:34.176 --> 00:18:39.490
to have a future.

00:18:44.009 --> 00:18:48.016
This whole idea of repeated
interaction was the future was

00:18:48.016 --> 00:18:51.180
going to create incentives for
the present.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.912
But if the games come to an
end, there's going to be some

00:18:53.912 --> 00:18:56.548
point when there isn't a future
anymore and then we get

00:18:56.548 --> 00:18:59.244
unraveling.
Now this is not just a formal

00:18:59.244 --> 00:19:02.970
technical point to be made in
the ivory tower of Yale.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.236
This is a true idea.
So for example,

00:19:06.236 --> 00:19:11.668
if we think about CEO's or
presidents, or managers of

00:19:11.668 --> 00:19:14.581
sports teams,
there's a term we use,

00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:18.079
there's a word we use--at least
in the states--to describe such

00:19:18.079 --> 00:19:21.296
leaders when they're getting
towards the end of their term

00:19:21.296 --> 00:19:25.280
and everyone knows it.
What's the expression we use?

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.964
"Lame duck."
So we have this lame duck

00:19:29.964 --> 00:19:33.765
effect.
The lame duck effect at the end

00:19:33.765 --> 00:19:38.660
of somebody's term undermines
their ability to cooperate,

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.550
their ability to provide
incentives for people to

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.200
cooperate with them,
and causes a problem.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.075
So this lame duck effect
affects presidents but it also

00:19:47.075 --> 00:19:50.337
affects CEO's of companies.
But it's not just leaders who

00:19:50.337 --> 00:19:53.223
run into this problem.
So if you have an employee,

00:19:53.223 --> 00:19:56.440
if you're employing somebody,
you may have a contract with

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.695
the person you're employing,
but basically you're sustaining

00:19:59.695 --> 00:20:02.512
cooperation with this person
because you interact with them

00:20:02.512 --> 00:20:03.807
often.
You know you're always going to

00:20:03.807 --> 00:20:05.684
interact with them.
But then this employee

00:20:05.684 --> 00:20:08.716
approaches retirement.
Everyone knows that in April or

00:20:08.716 --> 00:20:11.636
something they're going to
retire, then the future can't

00:20:11.636 --> 00:20:14.466
provide incentives anymore.
And you have to switch over

00:20:14.466 --> 00:20:17.031
from the implicit incentive of
knowing you're going to be

00:20:17.031 --> 00:20:19.929
interacting in the future,
to an explicit incentive of

00:20:19.929 --> 00:20:22.430
putting incentive clauses in the
contract.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.728
So retirement can cause,
if you like,

00:20:24.728 --> 00:20:26.070
a lame duck effect.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.730
This is even true in personal
relationships.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.769
In your personal relationships
with your friends,

00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:39.020
if you think that those
friendships are going to go on

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.167
for a long time,
be they with your significant

00:20:41.167 --> 00:20:43.359
other or just with the people
you hang out with,

00:20:43.359 --> 00:20:45.519
you're likely to get a lot of
cooperation.

00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:47.653
But if, as with perhaps most
economics majors,

00:20:47.653 --> 00:20:50.641
most of your significant others
are only going to last for a day

00:20:50.641 --> 00:20:52.287
at most,
you're not going to get great

00:20:52.287 --> 00:20:54.299
cooperation.
You're going to get cheating.

00:20:54.299 --> 00:20:57.160
No one's rising to that one but
I guess it's true.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.040
So what do we call these:
"economics majors'

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.180
relationships."

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.593
These are kind of "end effects."
All of these things are caused

00:21:17.593 --> 00:21:22.303
by the fact that the
relationship is coming to an

00:21:22.303 --> 00:21:24.245
end.
And once the relationship is

00:21:24.245 --> 00:21:26.353
coming to an end,
all those threats and promises

00:21:26.353 --> 00:21:28.860
of future behavior,
implicit or otherwise,

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.210
are going to basically
disappear.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:37.890
So at this point we might think
the following.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.420
You might conclude the
following.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.028
You might conclude that if a
relationship has a known end,

00:21:43.028 --> 00:21:46.383
if everyone knows the
relationship's going to end at a

00:21:46.383 --> 00:21:48.752
certain time,
then we're done and we

00:21:48.752 --> 00:21:51.748
basically can't sustain
cooperation through repeated

00:21:51.748 --> 00:21:55.194
interaction.
That's kind of what the example

00:21:55.194 --> 00:22:01.299
we looked at seems to suggest.
However, that's not quite true.

00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:04.611
So let's look at another
example where a relationship is

00:22:04.611 --> 00:22:07.983
going to have a known end but
nevertheless we are able to

00:22:07.983 --> 00:22:11.329
sustain some cooperation.
And we'll see how.

00:22:11.329 --> 00:22:14.764
So again, I'm being careful
here, I've said it helps

00:22:14.764 --> 00:22:16.695
to have a future.
I haven't said it's

00:22:16.695 --> 00:22:18.180
necessary to have a
future.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.320
So that's good news for the
Economics majors again.

00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:30.733
So let's do this example to
illustrate that,

00:22:30.733 --> 00:22:36.397
even a finite interaction,
even an interaction that's

00:22:36.397 --> 00:22:42.279
going to end and everyone knows
it's going to end,

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:44.680
might still have some hope for
cooperation.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.059
So look at this slightly more
complicated game here.

00:22:48.059 --> 00:22:51.763
And this game has three
strategies and we'll call them

00:22:51.763 --> 00:22:57.975
A, B, and C for each player.
The payoffs are as follows

00:22:57.975 --> 00:23:03.989
(4,4), (0,5),
(0,0), down here we'll do

00:23:03.989 --> 00:23:12.061
(0,0), (0,0) and (3,3),
and in the middle row (5,0),

00:23:12.061 --> 00:23:14.910
(1,1), (0,0).

00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:21.455
We're going to assume that this
game, just like we did with the

00:23:21.455 --> 00:23:24.641
first time we did Prisoner's
Dilemma, this game is going to

00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:27.112
be played twice.
It's going to be repeated,

00:23:27.112 --> 00:23:29.539
it's going to be played twice,
repeated once.

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:32.138
So let's just make sure we
understand what the point of

00:23:32.138 --> 00:23:33.767
this game is.
In this game,

00:23:33.767 --> 00:23:36.978
in the one shot game I hope
it's clear that (A,

00:23:36.978 --> 00:23:40.119
A) is kind of the cooperative
thing to do.

00:23:40.119 --> 00:23:47.270
We'd like to sustain play of
(A, A), because then both

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:54.960
players get 4 and that looks
pretty good for everybody.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:01.648
However, in the one shot game
(A, A) is not a Nash

00:24:01.648 --> 00:24:05.408
equilibrium.
Why is (A, A) not a Nash

00:24:05.408 --> 00:24:08.720
equilibrium?
Let me grab those mikes again.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.079
Why is (A, A) not a Nash
equilibrium?

00:24:12.079 --> 00:24:14.486
Anybody?
I'm even getting to know the

00:24:14.486 --> 00:24:17.830
names at this stage of the term.
This is Katie, right?

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.485
So shout out.
Student: The best

00:24:19.485 --> 00:24:21.289
response to the other guy
playing A is playing B.

00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:23.645
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so if I think the

00:24:23.645 --> 00:24:27.361
other person's going to play A,
I'm going to want to defect and

00:24:27.361 --> 00:24:30.079
play B and obtain a gain,
a gain of 1.

00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:33.390
So basically I'll get 5 rather
than 4.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:38.312
I'll defect to playing B and
get 5 rather than 4 for a gain

00:24:38.312 --> 00:24:42.882
of 1, is that right?
So (A, A) is not a Nash

00:24:42.882 --> 00:24:49.579
equilibrium in the one shot
game--we're sometimes going to

00:24:49.579 --> 00:24:54.750
call it--it's fine--in the one
shot game.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.220
So now imagine we play this
game twice.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:03.682
Instead of just playing once,
we're going to play this game

00:25:03.682 --> 00:25:05.940
two times.
I'll come back to that.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:10.084
Before I do that what are the
pure strategy Nash equilibria in

00:25:10.084 --> 00:25:12.298
this game?
Anybody?

00:25:12.298 --> 00:25:21.217
So the Nash equilibria in this
one shot game are (B,

00:25:21.217 --> 00:25:26.587
B) and (C, C).
There's some mixed ones as well

00:25:26.587 --> 00:25:29.613
but this will do.
So (B, B) and (C,

00:25:29.613 --> 00:25:33.650
C) are the pure strategy Nash
equilibria.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.900
Now consider playing this game
twice.

00:25:39.069 --> 00:25:41.303
And last time we looked at a
game played twice,

00:25:41.303 --> 00:25:44.071
it was Prisoner's Dilemma,
and we noticed that we couldn't

00:25:44.071 --> 00:25:46.936
sustain cooperation because in
the last stage people weren't

00:25:46.936 --> 00:25:49.898
going to cooperate and hence in
the first stage people weren't

00:25:49.898 --> 00:25:52.707
going to cooperate.
But let's look what happens

00:25:52.707 --> 00:25:55.667
here.
If this game is played twice is

00:25:55.667 --> 00:25:59.480
there any hope of sustaining
cooperation, i.e.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.215
A, in both stages?
Could we have people play A in

00:26:03.215 --> 00:26:07.060
the first stage and then play A
again in the second stage?

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.362
So Patrick's shaking his head.
So that's right to shake his

00:26:10.362 --> 00:26:11.579
head.
So let me grab the other mike.

00:26:11.579 --> 00:26:13.380
So why is that not going to
work?

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.911
Why can't we get people to
cooperate and play A in both

00:26:15.911 --> 00:26:16.697
periods?
Shout out.

00:26:16.697 --> 00:26:18.504
Student: In the second
period you're still going to

00:26:18.504 --> 00:26:20.156
defect and play B.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:26:20.156 --> 00:26:22.471
Good, so in the second
period, exactly the argument

00:26:22.471 --> 00:26:24.872
that Katie produced just now in
the one shot game applies

00:26:24.872 --> 00:26:27.230
because the second period game
is a one shot game.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:31.343
So we've got no hope of
sustaining cooperation in both

00:26:31.343 --> 00:26:34.620
periods.
Let's call this cooperation.

00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:48.281
We can't sustain (A,
A) in period two,

00:26:48.281 --> 00:26:55.634
in the second period.
However, I claim that we may be

00:26:55.634 --> 00:26:59.020
able to get people to cooperate
in the first period of the game.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:04.624
Now how are we going to do that?
So to see that let's consider

00:27:04.624 --> 00:27:15.883
the following strategy.
But consider the strategy--the

00:27:15.883 --> 00:27:31.247
strategy's going to be--play A
and then play C if (A,

00:27:31.247 --> 00:27:41.360
A) was played;
and play B otherwise.

00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:49.786
So this strategy is an
instruction telling the player

00:27:49.786 --> 00:27:54.134
how to play.
Now, before we consider whether

00:27:54.134 --> 00:27:59.922
this is an equilibrium or not,
let's just check that this

00:27:59.922 --> 00:28:04.053
actually is a strategy.
So what does a strategy have to

00:28:04.053 --> 00:28:06.161
do?
It has to tell me what I should

00:28:06.161 --> 00:28:09.260
do--it should give me an
instruction--at each of my

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.080
information sets.
In this two period game,

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.163
each of us, each of the players
in the game has two information

00:28:16.163 --> 00:28:18.066
sets.
They have an information set at

00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:20.642
the beginning of the game and
they have another information

00:28:20.642 --> 00:28:22.330
set at the beginning of period
two.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:25.238
Is that right?
So it has to tell you what to

00:28:25.238 --> 00:28:28.194
do at the first information set
and at the second information

00:28:28.194 --> 00:28:31.116
set and it does.
It says play A at the first

00:28:31.116 --> 00:28:35.458
one, and then at the beginning
of period two--I said there's

00:28:35.458 --> 00:28:39.068
only one information set there,
but actually there's nine

00:28:39.068 --> 00:28:41.463
possible information sets
depending on what happened in

00:28:41.463 --> 00:28:43.581
the first period.
So each thing that happened in

00:28:43.581 --> 00:28:45.962
the first period is associated
with a different information

00:28:45.962 --> 00:28:47.337
set.
I always know what happened in

00:28:47.337 --> 00:28:49.227
the first period.
And at each of those nine

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:52.097
information sets it tells me
what to do at the beginning of

00:28:52.097 --> 00:28:54.132
period two.
In particular,

00:28:54.132 --> 00:28:59.598
it says if it turns out that
(A, A) was played then play C

00:28:59.598 --> 00:29:01.380
now.
And otherwise,

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.903
all the other eight possible
information sets I could find

00:29:05.903 --> 00:29:09.440
myself in, play B.
So this is a strategy.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.951
Now of course the big question
is, is this strategy an

00:29:12.951 --> 00:29:16.529
equilibrium, and in particular
is it a sub-game perfect

00:29:16.529 --> 00:29:17.590
equilibrium?

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:27.040
Let me a bit more precise:
if both players were playing

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.600
this strategy would that be a
sub-game perfect equilibrium?

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.460
Well let's have a look.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:45.996
(Of course I don't see it now
so let's pull both these boards

00:29:45.996 --> 00:29:54.105
down.) So to check whether this
is a sub-game perfect

00:29:54.105 --> 00:29:58.024
equilibrium,
we're going to have to check

00:29:58.024 --> 00:30:00.345
what?
We're going to have to check

00:30:00.345 --> 00:30:03.799
that it induces Nash behavior in
each sub-game.

00:30:03.799 --> 00:30:08.700
(I think the battery is going
on that.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:13.480
Shall I get rid of that.
Okay, I'm going to shout.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.214
Can people still hear me?
People in the balcony can they

00:30:16.214 --> 00:30:22.789
hear me?
Yup, okay.) So we're going to

00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:36.150
have to see if we can sustain
Nash behavior in each sub-game.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:40.631
So let's start with the
sub-games associated with the

00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:42.383
second period.
Technically,

00:30:42.383 --> 00:30:44.190
there are nine such sub-games
depending on what happened in

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.059
the past, depending on what
happened in the first period.

00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:47.710
There's a sub-game following
(A,A).

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:49.569
There's a sub-game following
(A,B).

00:30:49.569 --> 00:30:53.560
There's a sub-game following
(A,C), and so on.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.530
So for each activity in the
first period,

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:06.069
for each profile in the first
period there's a sub-game.

00:31:06.069 --> 00:31:09.315
However, it doesn't really
matter to distinguish all of

00:31:09.315 --> 00:31:12.079
these sub-games particularly
carefully here,

00:31:12.079 --> 00:31:15.883
since the costs from the past,
what happened in the past is

00:31:15.883 --> 00:31:18.900
sunk, so we'll just look at them
as a whole.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:30.083
So in period two after
(A,A)--so you have one in

00:31:30.083 --> 00:31:41.267
particular of those nine
sub-games--after (A,A),

00:31:41.267 --> 00:31:49.119
this strategy induces (C,
C).

00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:51.465
If people play A,
if both people play A in the

00:31:51.465 --> 00:31:53.707
first period,
then in the sub-game following

00:31:53.707 --> 00:31:55.740
people are supposed to play (C,
C).

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.640
Is that a Nash equilibrium of
the sub-game?

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.509
Well was (C,C) a Nash
equilibrium?

00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:03.720
Yeah, it's one of our Nash
equilibria.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.579
Let's just look up there,
we've got it listed.

00:32:05.579 --> 00:32:08.035
There it is.
So we're playing this Nash

00:32:08.035 --> 00:32:14.500
equilibrium.
So that is a Nash equilibrium,

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:26.318
so we're okay.
After the other choices in

00:32:26.318 --> 00:32:40.920
period one, this strategy
induces (B, B).

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:46.001
That's good news too because
(B, B), we already agreed,

00:32:46.001 --> 00:32:50.329
was a Nash equilibrium in the
one shot game.

00:32:50.329 --> 00:32:54.212
So in all of those nine
sub-games, the one after (A,A),

00:32:54.212 --> 00:32:58.094
and the eight after everything
else, we're playing Nash

00:32:58.094 --> 00:33:02.410
behavior, so that's good.
What about in the whole game?

00:33:06.009 --> 00:33:10.678
In the whole game,
starting from period one,

00:33:10.678 --> 00:33:16.541
we have to ask do you do better
to play the strategy as

00:33:16.541 --> 00:33:20.956
designated,
in particular to choose A,

00:33:20.956 --> 00:33:24.600
or would you do better to
defect?

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:30.963
Well let's have a look.
So if I choose A--remember the

00:33:30.963 --> 00:33:37.775
other person is playing this
strategy--so if I choose A then

00:33:37.775 --> 00:33:44.009
my payoff in this period comes
from (A,A) and is 4.

00:33:44.009 --> 00:33:50.174
If I choose A then we're both
playing A in this period and I

00:33:50.174 --> 00:33:53.960
get 4.
Tomorrow, according to this

00:33:53.960 --> 00:34:00.627
strategy--tomorrow since we both
played A--both of us will now

00:34:00.627 --> 00:34:04.008
play C.
Since we're both playing C,

00:34:04.008 --> 00:34:07.059
I'll get an additional payoff
of 3.

00:34:07.059 --> 00:34:13.648
So tomorrow (C,
C) will occur and I'll get 3

00:34:13.648 --> 00:34:19.019
for a total of 7.
What about if I defect?

00:34:19.019 --> 00:34:20.950
We could consider lots of
possible defections,

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:23.010
but let's just consider the
obvious defection.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.369
You can check the other ones at
home.

00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:33.571
So if I defect and choose B
now, then, in this period,

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:41.773
I will be playing B and my
opponent or my pair will be

00:34:41.773 --> 00:34:49.789
playing A.
So in this period I will get 5.

00:34:49.789 --> 00:34:55.777
And tomorrow,
since (A,A) did not occur,

00:34:55.777 --> 00:35:04.989
both of us will play B and get
a continuation payoff of 1.

00:35:04.989 --> 00:35:12.691
So the continuation payoff this
time will be following from (B,

00:35:12.691 --> 00:35:16.533
B), and I'll get 1.
Why don't I do what I've been

00:35:16.533 --> 00:35:18.659
doing before in this class and
put boxes around the

00:35:18.659 --> 00:35:22.164
continuation payoffs,
just to indicate that they are,

00:35:22.164 --> 00:35:26.107
in fact, continuation payoffs.
So if I play A,

00:35:26.107 --> 00:35:32.130
I get 4 now and a continuation
payoff of 3, for a total of 7.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.448
If I play B now,
I gain something now,

00:35:35.448 --> 00:35:39.036
I get 5 now,
but tomorrow I'll only get 1

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:40.920
for a total of 6.

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:47.805
So in fact, 7 is bigger than 6,
so I'm okay and I won't want to

00:35:47.805 --> 00:35:49.030
do this defection.

00:35:54.019 --> 00:35:56.939
I just want to write this one
other way because it's going to

00:35:56.939 --> 00:35:59.995
be useful for later.
So one other way to write this,

00:35:59.995 --> 00:36:03.069
I think we've convinced
ourselves that this is an

00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:05.016
equilibrium,
but one other way to write this

00:36:05.016 --> 00:36:06.639
is, and it's a more general way
in repeated games,

00:36:06.639 --> 00:36:11.465
is to write it explicitly
comparing the temptations to

00:36:11.465 --> 00:36:17.019
cheat today with the rewards and
punishments from tomorrow.

00:36:17.019 --> 00:36:27.149
So what we want to do is,
in general, we can just rewrite

00:36:27.149 --> 00:36:36.916
this as checking that the
temptation to cheat or defect

00:36:36.916 --> 00:36:48.311
today is smaller than the value
of the reward minus the value of

00:36:48.311 --> 00:36:53.962
the punishment.
But the key words here are:

00:36:53.962 --> 00:37:00.733
defecting occurs today;
rewards and punishments occur

00:37:00.733 --> 00:37:04.363
tomorrow.
If we just rewrite it this way,

00:37:04.363 --> 00:37:07.308
we'll see exactly the same
thing, just rearranging

00:37:07.308 --> 00:37:10.515
slightly.
The temptation to defect today

00:37:10.515 --> 00:37:14.990
is I get 5 rather than 4,
or if you like a gain of 1.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:25.228
And the value of the reward
tomorrow--the reward was to play

00:37:25.228 --> 00:37:31.621
(C, C) tomorrow and get 3.
The value of the punishment

00:37:31.621 --> 00:37:36.854
tomorrow was to play (B,
B) tomorrow and get 1,

00:37:36.854 --> 00:37:41.577
and that difference is 2.
So here the fact that the

00:37:41.577 --> 00:37:45.389
temptation is outweighed by the
difference between the value of

00:37:45.389 --> 00:37:49.262
the reward and the value of the
punishment is what enabled us to

00:37:49.262 --> 00:37:53.013
sustain cooperation.
I'm just writing that in a more

00:37:53.013 --> 00:37:57.367
general way because this is the
way that we can apply in games

00:37:57.367 --> 00:38:01.095
from here on.
We're going to compare

00:38:01.095 --> 00:38:06.620
temptations to cheat with
tomorrow's promises.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:12.780
Patrick, let me get you a mike.
Student: I don't

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.210
understand why it's reasonable
to think you would play (B,

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.812
B) in the second period though.
In the second period you have a

00:38:18.812 --> 00:38:22.285
temptation to play C,
C even if the person defected

00:38:22.285 --> 00:38:23.822
on you.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:38:23.822 --> 00:38:25.139
Good, that's a very good
point.

00:38:25.139 --> 00:38:29.194
So what Patrick's saying is,
it's all very well to say we're

00:38:29.194 --> 00:38:32.630
sustaining cooperation in the
first period here,

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.764
but the way in which we
sustained cooperation was by

00:38:35.764 --> 00:38:37.670
going along with,
as it were,

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.346
the punishment tomorrow.
It required me,

00:38:40.346 --> 00:38:44.740
tomorrow, to go along with the
strategy of choosing B if I

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.611
cheated in the first period.
I want to answer this twice,

00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:51.469
once disagreeing with him and
once agreeing with him.

00:38:51.469 --> 00:38:53.269
So let me just disagree with
him first.

00:38:53.269 --> 00:38:56.372
So notice tomorrow,
if the other person,

00:38:56.372 --> 00:39:01.144
the other player is going to
play B then I'm going to want to

00:39:01.144 --> 00:39:03.486
play B.
So the key idea here is,

00:39:03.486 --> 00:39:07.031
as always in Nash equilibrium,
if I take the other person's

00:39:07.031 --> 00:39:10.759
play as given and just look at
my own behavior--if I think the

00:39:10.759 --> 00:39:14.426
other person is playing this
strategy and hence he's going to

00:39:14.426 --> 00:39:17.909
play B tomorrow after I've
cheated--then I want to be play

00:39:17.909 --> 00:39:19.780
B myself.
So that check is just our

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.135
standard check,
and actually that's the check

00:39:21.135 --> 00:39:22.706
that makes sure that it really
is a sub-game perfect

00:39:22.706 --> 00:39:24.148
equilibrium.
We're not putting some

00:39:24.148 --> 00:39:26.780
punishments down the tree that
are arising out of equilibrium.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.529
It has to be I want to do
tomorrow what I'm told to do

00:39:29.529 --> 00:39:31.351
tomorrow.
So that idea seems right and

00:39:31.351 --> 00:39:33.899
I'm glad Patrick raised it
because that was the next thing

00:39:33.899 --> 00:39:36.266
in my notes.
I want to go along with this

00:39:36.266 --> 00:39:39.840
punishment because if the other
person's playing B I want to

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.727
play B myself.
Nevertheless,

00:39:41.727 --> 00:39:45.155
I think Patrick's onto
something and let me come back

00:39:45.155 --> 00:39:48.804
to it in a minute.
What I want to do before I do

00:39:48.804 --> 00:39:53.099
that is just draw out a general
lesson from this game.

00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:58.709
The general lesson is we can
sustain cooperation even in a

00:39:58.709 --> 00:40:03.953
finitely repeated game,
but to do so we need there to

00:40:03.953 --> 00:40:09.039
be more than one Nash
equilibrium in the stage game.

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:11.843
What we need there to be is
several Nash equilibria,

00:40:11.843 --> 00:40:15.086
one at least of which we can
use as a reward and another one

00:40:15.086 --> 00:40:17.119
which we can use as a
punishment.

00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:24.937
So even if a game is only
played a finite number of times,

00:40:24.937 --> 00:40:32.070
if there are several equilibria
in the stage game,

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:36.838
both (B,B) and (C,C),
we can use one of them as a

00:40:36.838 --> 00:40:41.110
reward and the other one as a
punishment,

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:44.948
and use that difference to try
and get people to resist

00:40:44.948 --> 00:40:48.588
temptations today.
So that's the general idea

00:40:48.588 --> 00:40:51.830
here, and let's just write that
down.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:01.879
Patrick don't let me get away
with not coming back to your

00:41:01.879 --> 00:41:05.070
point, I want to come back to it
in a second.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:12.257
So the lesson here is,
if a stage game--a stage game

00:41:12.257 --> 00:41:20.571
is the game that's going to be
repeated--if a stage game has

00:41:20.571 --> 00:41:26.349
more than one Nash equilibrium
in it,

00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:47.580
then we may be able to use the
prospect of playing different

00:41:47.580 --> 00:42:09.171
equilibria tomorrow to provide
incentives--and we could think

00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:31.481
of these incentives as rewards
and punishments--for cooperation

00:42:31.481 --> 00:42:36.895
today.
In the game we just saw,

00:42:36.895 --> 00:42:39.542
there were exactly two pure
strategy Nash equilibria in the

00:42:39.542 --> 00:42:42.029
sub-game.
We used one of them as a reward

00:42:42.029 --> 00:42:45.344
and the other one as a
punishment, and we were able to

00:42:45.344 --> 00:42:48.910
sustain cooperation in a
sub-game perfect equilibrium.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:55.519
Now, a question arises here,
and I think it's behind

00:42:55.519 --> 00:42:58.717
Patrick's question,
and that is how plausible is

00:42:58.717 --> 00:43:00.539
this?
How plausible is this?

00:43:00.539 --> 00:43:04.440
Formally, if we write down the
game and do the math,

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:09.004
this comes out.
But how plausible is this as a

00:43:09.004 --> 00:43:13.030
model of what's going on in
society?

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.863
I think the worry--I'm guessing
this is worry that was behind

00:43:15.863 --> 00:43:19.687
Patrick's question--is this.
Suppose I'm playing this game

00:43:19.687 --> 00:43:25.000
with Patrick and suppose Patrick
cheats on me the first period,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.723
so Patrick chooses B while I
wanted him to choose A in the

00:43:27.723 --> 00:43:30.496
first period.
Now in the second period,

00:43:30.496 --> 00:43:33.869
according to the equilibrium
instructions,

00:43:33.869 --> 00:43:38.476
we're supposed to play (B,
B) and get payoffs of 1 rather

00:43:38.476 --> 00:43:42.686
than (C,C) and get payoffs of 3.
So let's make that visible

00:43:42.686 --> 00:43:43.000
again.

00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:51.159
But suppose Patrick comes to me
in the meantime.

00:43:51.159 --> 00:43:53.996
So between period one and
period two, Patrick shows up at

00:43:53.996 --> 00:43:55.820
my office hours and he says:
yeah,

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.329
I know I cheated on you
yesterday, but why should we

00:43:59.329 --> 00:44:02.069
punish ourselves today?
Why should we,

00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:06.219
both of us, lose today by
playing the (B,B) equilibrium?

00:44:06.219 --> 00:44:09.550
Why don't we both switch to the
(C,C) equilibrium?

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:11.610
After all, that's better for
both of us.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:15.690
Patrick's saying to me,
it's true that I cheated you

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:19.050
yesterday, but "let bygones be
bygones,"

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:21.672
or "why cry over spilt milk,"
or he'll use some other saying

00:44:21.672 --> 00:44:23.449
plucked out of the book of
platitudes,

00:44:23.449 --> 00:44:25.902
and say to me:
well why go along with the

00:44:25.902 --> 00:44:28.538
punishment.
Let's just play the good

00:44:28.538 --> 00:44:31.502
equilibrium now.
And, if I look at things and I

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:34.217
say well, actually,
it's true I got nothing in the

00:44:34.217 --> 00:44:37.486
first period because Patrick
kind of cheated me in the first

00:44:37.486 --> 00:44:40.700
period--so it's true I got
nothing yesterday--and it's true

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.079
it was Patrick who caused me to
get nothing yesterday,

00:44:44.079 --> 00:44:46.609
but nevertheless that's a sunk
cost and I'm comparing getting 1

00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:49.097
now with getting 3 now.
Why don't we just go along and

00:44:49.097 --> 00:44:51.552
get 3?
Moreover, I'm not in danger of

00:44:51.552 --> 00:44:55.705
being cheated again because if
Patrick believes I'm going to

00:44:55.705 --> 00:44:58.239
play C, he's going to play C
too.

00:44:58.239 --> 00:45:03.889
So that kind of argument
involves what?

00:45:03.889 --> 00:45:06.936
It involves some kind of
communication between stages,

00:45:06.936 --> 00:45:09.810
but it sounds like that's going
to be a problem.

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:12.309
Why?
Well, suppose it's the case

00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:14.840
that we are going to get
communication between periods

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.610
and suppose it's the case that
someone with the gift of the

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:18.936
gab,
someone on his way to law

00:45:18.936 --> 00:45:20.765
school like Patrick,
is going to be able to persuade

00:45:20.765 --> 00:45:22.666
me to go back to the good
equilibrium for everybody in

00:45:22.666 --> 00:45:25.302
period two,
then we know we're going to

00:45:25.302 --> 00:45:29.658
play the good equilibrium in
period two and now we've lost

00:45:29.658 --> 00:45:33.019
any incentive to cooperate in
period one.

00:45:33.019 --> 00:45:35.815
The only reason I was willing
to cooperate in period one was

00:45:35.815 --> 00:45:38.848
because the temptation to defect
was outweighed by the difference

00:45:38.848 --> 00:45:42.070
between the value of the reward
and the value of the punishment.

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:44.567
If we're going to get the
reward anyway,

00:45:44.567 --> 00:45:48.820
I'll go ahead and defect today.
So the problem here is this

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:53.735
notion of "renegotiation," this
notion of communicating between

00:45:53.735 --> 00:45:57.699
periods can undermine this kind
of equilibrium.

00:45:57.699 --> 00:46:00.690
There's a problem that arises
if we have renegotiation.

00:46:08.539 --> 00:46:19.930
So there may be a problem of
renegotiation.

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.250
Now, this probably may not be
such a big problem.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:28.686
For example,
it may be, say,

00:46:28.686 --> 00:46:31.666
I'll be so angry at Patrick
because he screwed me over in

00:46:31.666 --> 00:46:34.860
period one that I won't go along
with the renegotiation.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.032
It may also be the case,
and we'll see some examples of

00:46:38.032 --> 00:46:42.430
this on the homework assignment,
that the many equilibria in the

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:46.920
second stage of the game are not
such that a punishment for

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.940
Patrick is also a punishment for
me.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.359
What really caused the problem
here was, in trying to punish

00:46:53.359 --> 00:46:56.769
Patrick, I had to punish myself.
But you could imagine games,

00:46:56.769 --> 00:47:00.010
or see some concrete examples
on the next homework assignment,

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:02.523
in which punishing Patrick is
rather fun for me,

00:47:02.523 --> 00:47:04.929
and punishing me is rather fun
for Patrick,

00:47:04.929 --> 00:47:07.954
and that's going to be much
harder to renegotiate our way

00:47:07.954 --> 00:47:09.647
out of.
There was a question,

00:47:09.647 --> 00:47:11.889
let me get a mike out to the
question.

00:47:11.889 --> 00:47:16.099
Yeah?
Student: If we're ruling

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:21.713
out renegotiation,
can't we devise a strategy for

00:47:21.713 --> 00:47:28.963
Prisoner's Dilemma as well even
though it doesn't have multiple

00:47:28.963 --> 00:47:33.047
Nash equilibriums?
Professor Ben Polak:

00:47:33.047 --> 00:47:35.381
Yeah, okay good,
so the issue there is,

00:47:35.381 --> 00:47:38.356
in Prisoner's Dilemma,
we established in the first

00:47:38.356 --> 00:47:41.530
week that if we're not allowed
to make side payments,

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.391
we're not allowed to bring in
outside contracts,

00:47:43.391 --> 00:47:45.530
then no amount of communication
is going to help us.

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:48.731
So you're right if we can rely
on the courts or the mafia to

00:47:48.731 --> 00:47:52.094
enforce the contracts that would
be fine and then communication

00:47:52.094 --> 00:47:54.664
would have bite.
But you remember way back in

00:47:54.664 --> 00:47:58.006
the first week when we tried to
talk our way out of bad behavior

00:47:58.006 --> 00:48:01.028
in the Prisoner's Dilemma it
didn't help precisely because

00:48:01.028 --> 00:48:03.433
it's a dominant strategy.
Whereas, here,

00:48:03.433 --> 00:48:06.456
Patrick's conversation,
Patrick's verbal agreement to

00:48:06.456 --> 00:48:09.711
play the other equilibrium is an
agreement to play a Nash

00:48:09.711 --> 00:48:13.569
equilibrium.
That's what is getting us into

00:48:13.569 --> 00:48:15.732
trouble.
So what may help us here,

00:48:15.732 --> 00:48:19.014
what may avoid renegotiation is
simply I'm not going to go along

00:48:19.014 --> 00:48:22.295
with that renegotiation--I'm too
angry about having been cheated

00:48:22.295 --> 00:48:25.317
on--and it may be for other
reasons it may actually be that

00:48:25.317 --> 00:48:27.470
I enjoy the punishment.
Nevertheless,

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:29.878
this is a real problem in
society and I don't think we

00:48:29.878 --> 00:48:32.059
should pretend that this problem
isn't there.

00:48:32.059 --> 00:48:38.651
So a good example is in
bankruptcy, which is one of

00:48:38.651 --> 00:48:43.928
those words I can never spell.
It seems I have too many

00:48:43.928 --> 00:48:45.296
consonants in it,
is that right?

00:48:45.296 --> 00:48:46.840
It's approximately right
anyway.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:51.829
So bankruptcy law in the U.S.
for the last 200 odd years has

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:55.979
gone through cycles.
One way to view these cycles

00:48:55.979 --> 00:49:00.967
is, they're cycles of relaxing
the law and making life "easier

00:49:00.967 --> 00:49:04.809
for borrowers" and then
tightening up again.

00:49:04.809 --> 00:49:07.091
This is not a recent
phenomenon, this is not only a

00:49:07.091 --> 00:49:09.190
recent phenomenon,
this occurred throughout the

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:12.029
nineteenth century.
So what typically happened was

00:49:12.029 --> 00:49:15.429
there was either explicit
renegotiation between parties or

00:49:15.429 --> 00:49:18.829
renegotiation through act of
Congress or sometimes through

00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:23.271
the acts of the states,
in which bankrupt debtors were

00:49:23.271 --> 00:49:27.059
basically let off or given
easier terms.

00:49:27.059 --> 00:49:28.460
The argument was always the
same.

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:31.440
These people are not going to
pay back now.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:35.802
It's clear from the nineteenth
century, often if you were

00:49:35.802 --> 00:49:40.010
bankrupt you were in jail,
actually worse than that.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.495
Sometimes in the nineteenth
century in England not only if

00:49:42.495 --> 00:49:44.980
you were bankrupt were you in
jail but your creditors were

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.030
having to pay the fees to feed
you in jail.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:49.002
So there you were sitting in
jail, you weren't paying that

00:49:49.002 --> 00:49:52.013
money back to your creditor,
and you're actually costing

00:49:52.013 --> 00:49:55.010
money to your creditor by being
in jail.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:56.599
This seems like a situation
that you want to renegotiate

00:49:56.599 --> 00:49:58.392
your way out of.
You say, hey let's let these

00:49:58.392 --> 00:50:00.483
guys out of jail.
Let them be productive again,

00:50:00.483 --> 00:50:02.460
and then they'll pay back part
of the loans.

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:06.914
So you had these waves of
bankruptcy reform in which the

00:50:06.914 --> 00:50:11.287
debtors' prisons were closed
down, people were let out,

00:50:11.287 --> 00:50:14.896
people were relieved of debt.
What's the problem with doing

00:50:14.896 --> 00:50:16.154
that?
That seems like a good idea

00:50:16.154 --> 00:50:17.887
right.
After all, you don't want all

00:50:17.887 --> 00:50:20.502
these people bankrupt,
in debt, not paying money back

00:50:20.502 --> 00:50:23.074
to their creditors anyway.
That doesn't seem like a good

00:50:23.074 --> 00:50:25.511
situation in society.
It seems like a renegotiation

00:50:25.511 --> 00:50:28.530
that's a win-win situation:
it's better for everybody.

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:30.640
What's the problem with it
though?

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:34.349
Let's get a mike down here.
What's the problem with this?

00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:37.800
Student: It incentivizes
bankruptcy.

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.633
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, it creates an

00:50:39.633 --> 00:50:41.780
incentive for people not to
repay in the first place.

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:45.661
It creates an incentive for
people to take big risks now,

00:50:45.661 --> 00:50:48.642
and hence, it makes bankruptcy,
if you like,

00:50:48.642 --> 00:50:51.900
or makes non-repayment of debt
more likely.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.991
So this has been going on for a
while, but you see it very much

00:50:54.991 --> 00:50:58.082
today if you read the financial
pages of the papers in the last

00:50:58.082 --> 00:51:00.559
few weeks.
There's a big worry in the U.S.

00:51:00.559 --> 00:51:03.980
right now about people failing
to repay what kind of debt?

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.980
What kind of debt is the big
worry about?

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.080
Mortgage debt,
right, so those people who are

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.610
house owners failing to pay back
mortgage debt and,

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:13.184
equally worrying,
financial institutions that

00:51:13.184 --> 00:51:15.289
have a lent a lot of,
for example,

00:51:15.289 --> 00:51:20.019
sub-prime debt now find
themselves in financial trouble.

00:51:20.019 --> 00:51:22.917
You're going to read a lot in
the papers about not letting

00:51:22.917 --> 00:51:26.070
people out lightly out of those
situations of being in debt,

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:28.730
or not letting people out
lightly out of bankruptcy.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:33.270
The term you're going to hear
is "bail out."

00:51:39.719 --> 00:51:43.254
So bail out--the argument
you're going to read is,

00:51:43.254 --> 00:51:47.581
you don't want the government
or the central bank bailing out

00:51:47.581 --> 00:51:52.125
those financial institutions who
have apparently taken too large

00:51:52.125 --> 00:51:55.010
risks on sub-prime mortgage
debts,

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:57.880
even though we all agree it's
better right now for those

00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.019
financial institutions not to go
under.

00:52:00.019 --> 00:52:02.455
Why are we not going to--Even
though it's better for everybody

00:52:02.455 --> 00:52:04.491
for it not to go under,
why are we not going to bail

00:52:04.491 --> 00:52:05.912
them out?
Because it undermines the

00:52:05.912 --> 00:52:07.969
incentives for them not to make
bad loans to start with.

00:52:07.969 --> 00:52:11.474
To a lesser extent you're going
to hear that on the debtor side

00:52:11.474 --> 00:52:12.867
as well.
You're going to hear some

00:52:12.867 --> 00:52:14.719
people say we shouldn't be
bailing out people who took on

00:52:14.719 --> 00:52:16.943
bad loans,
took on bad mortgages to

00:52:16.943 --> 00:52:20.679
finance their houses,
again for bail out reasons.

00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:22.699
So this is an important trade
off.

00:52:22.699 --> 00:52:25.662
If you go on to law school,
you're going to see a lot about

00:52:25.662 --> 00:52:31.139
this kind of discussion,
and this is the discussion of

00:52:31.139 --> 00:52:39.010
trading off ex-ante efficiency
and ex-post efficiency.

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.053
Sometimes, as Patrick has
pointed out in the game just

00:52:48.053 --> 00:52:51.113
now, the ex-post efficient thing
to do is to go back to the good

00:52:51.113 --> 00:52:53.245
equilibrium,
or if you like to bail out

00:52:53.245 --> 00:52:55.070
these firms who've made bad
loans.

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:57.637
However, from an ex-ante point
of view, it creates bad

00:52:57.637 --> 00:53:00.690
incentives for people to make
those loans in the first place;

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:03.493
and, in the ex-ante point of
view, it created the incentive

00:53:03.493 --> 00:53:06.199
for people to defect in the
first period of that game.

00:53:06.199 --> 00:53:08.908
So this theme of ex-ante versus
ex-post efficiency is not one

00:53:08.908 --> 00:53:11.030
we're going to go into anymore
in this class,

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:14.944
but it should be there in the
back of your minds when you all

00:53:14.944 --> 00:53:17.750
end up in law school in a few
years time.

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:20.789
Okay, so, so far what have we
done?

00:53:20.789 --> 00:53:24.355
We've been looking at repeated
interaction and seeing if it can

00:53:24.355 --> 00:53:27.798
sustain cooperation.
The first thing we learned was

00:53:27.798 --> 00:53:32.010
that if the repeated interaction
is a finite interaction,

00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:34.496
if we know when it's going to
end--we know when the

00:53:34.496 --> 00:53:37.630
interaction's going to end--then
sustaining cooperation is going

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:40.266
to be hard because in the last
period there will be an

00:53:40.266 --> 00:53:43.084
incentive to defect.
We saw we could get around that

00:53:43.084 --> 00:53:45.444
to some extent if games have
multiple equilibria,

00:53:45.444 --> 00:53:48.050
but in a game like Prisoner's
Dilemma, we're really in

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:52.247
trouble.
Things will unravel from the

00:53:52.247 --> 00:53:54.185
back.
So now let's mix things up a

00:53:54.185 --> 00:53:56.788
little bit by looking at a more
complicated variety of repeated

00:53:56.788 --> 00:53:59.043
interactions.
Rather than just play the game

00:53:59.043 --> 00:54:00.573
once or twice,
or three times,

00:54:00.573 --> 00:54:03.159
let's play the game under the
following rules.

00:54:03.159 --> 00:54:06.091
We'll go back to our same
players, how many mikes are

00:54:06.091 --> 00:54:08.078
still out here?
I took them both back,

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:10.308
is that right?
I'm taking both the green and

00:54:10.308 --> 00:54:12.680
the blue mike,
and I'm giving them back to our

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:16.924
players.
So this is to Brooke and this

00:54:16.924 --> 00:54:20.480
is to Patrick.
And we're going to have Brooke

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.860
and Patrick play Prisoner's
Dilemma again.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:28.789
I'm hoping I haven't deleted it.
Maybe I did.

00:54:28.789 --> 00:54:31.019
It doesn't matter we know the
payoffs.

00:54:31.019 --> 00:54:35.043
We're going to have them play
Prisoner's Dilemma again,

00:54:35.043 --> 00:54:38.172
but this time,
in between every play of the

00:54:38.172 --> 00:54:43.018
game, I'm going to toss a coin.
Actually I'll toss the coin

00:54:43.018 --> 00:54:48.076
twice and if that coin comes up
heads both times then the game

00:54:48.076 --> 00:54:51.889
will end, but otherwise they'll
play again.

00:54:51.889 --> 00:54:53.093
So everyone understand what
we're going to do?

00:54:53.093 --> 00:54:54.190
We're going to play Prisoner's
Dilemma.

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:57.300
At the end of every period I'll
toss a coin twice.

00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:00.480
I might get Jake to toss it.
Jake will toss a coin twice.

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:04.709
If it comes up heads both times
the game's over but otherwise

00:55:04.709 --> 00:55:07.610
the game continues.
So both Brooke and Patrick

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.506
should get ready to play,
and the payoffs of this game

00:55:10.506 --> 00:55:13.944
are just what we had before.
So let's just remind ourselves

00:55:13.944 --> 00:55:15.980
what the payoffs of that game
are.

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:22.071
So we've got cooperate,
defect, cooperate,

00:55:22.071 --> 00:55:28.460
defect, (2,2),
(-1,3), (3, -1) and (0,0).

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:36.510
And we'll keep score here:
so this Brooke and Patrick.

00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:39.230
So, putting pressure on these
guys, let's write down what

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:40.980
you're going to do the first
time.

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:46.824
Brooke? Student: Defect.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:55:46.824 --> 00:55:47.909
Patrick?
Student: Cooperate.

00:55:47.909 --> 00:55:51.226
Professor Ben Polak:
 All right.

00:55:51.226 --> 00:55:55.327
I think we're getting some
payback from earlier,

00:55:55.327 --> 00:55:57.210
right.
Round two.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.340
Student: Are you going
to toss the coin?

00:55:58.340 --> 00:55:59.366
Professor Ben Polak:
Oh I have to toss the coin,

00:55:59.366 --> 00:56:00.070
you're absolutely right,
thank you.

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:05.190
Now I have to find a coin.
Look at that, thank you Ale.

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:06.980
Twice: toss it twice.

00:56:11.489 --> 00:56:15.920
Heads, heads again,
so the game is over.

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.921
That didn't last long.
Just for the sake of the class,

00:56:18.921 --> 00:56:21.550
let's pretend that it came up
tails.

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:25.762
Okay we'll cheat a little bit.
Okay, so we're playing a second

00:56:25.762 --> 00:56:28.989
time--just with a little bit of
cheating.

00:56:28.989 --> 00:56:33.553
I need someone else,
someone less honest to toss the

00:56:33.553 --> 00:56:35.519
coin.
Brooke what do you choose?

00:56:35.519 --> 00:56:36.679
Student: Oh I'm
defecting.

00:56:36.679 --> 00:56:38.683
Professor Ben Polak:
Defecting again,

00:56:38.683 --> 00:56:41.139
Patrick?
Student: Cooperate.

00:56:41.139 --> 00:56:44.469
Professor Ben Polak:
Cooperate,

00:56:44.469 --> 00:56:49.599
Patrick seems very trusting
here, all right let's toss the

00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:52.409
coin a third time.
All right, Brooke?

00:56:52.409 --> 00:56:57.900
Student: I'm going to
defect again.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:02.501
Student: Defect.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:57:02.501 --> 00:57:06.666
 All right,
heads, heads,

00:57:06.666 --> 00:57:12.014
so this time we'll end it.
So what happened this time,

00:57:12.014 --> 00:57:14.566
let's just talk about it a bit.
So Brooke and Patrick were

00:57:14.566 --> 00:57:17.117
playing, Patrick cooperated a
bit in the beginning,

00:57:17.117 --> 00:57:19.730
Brooke's defected throughout.
Brooke why did you defect?

00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:21.019
Shout out so everyone can hear
you.

00:57:21.019 --> 00:57:23.280
Why did you defect right from
the start of the game?

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.297
Student: Because last
time it didn't work so well

00:57:27.297 --> 00:57:28.719
cooperating.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:57:28.719 --> 00:57:29.500
 Last time it didn't work
so well, okay.

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:33.236
Fair enough but even after
Patrick was sort of cooperating

00:57:33.236 --> 00:57:37.380
you went on defecting.
So why then?

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:43.955
Student: Because I
wanted to get the higher payoff,

00:57:43.955 --> 00:57:50.531
I thought either he would
continue cooperating and I could

00:57:50.531 --> 00:57:52.445
defect,
Professor Ben Polak:

00:57:52.445 --> 00:57:53.706
 All right,
if he had gone on cooperating,

00:57:53.706 --> 00:57:55.852
which in fact he did.
Patrick why were you

00:57:55.852 --> 00:57:58.883
cooperating early on here?
Shout out so people can hear

00:57:58.883 --> 00:58:00.864
you.
Student: So with a two

00:58:00.864 --> 00:58:04.699
head rule, like you have a 75%
chance at having another game.

00:58:04.699 --> 00:58:08.391
So with those payoffs,
even one period the payoff of

00:58:08.391 --> 00:58:12.010
cooperating twice is the same as
defecting once,

00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:15.975
so it's better if you can
continue cooperating,

00:58:15.975 --> 00:58:20.889
and the percentage is high
enough that it would make sense

00:58:20.889 --> 00:58:22.614
to do so.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:58:22.614 --> 00:58:23.746
 All right,
if you figure there's a good

00:58:23.746 --> 00:58:25.245
enough chance of getting--even
after Brooke's defected the

00:58:25.245 --> 00:58:26.349
first period you went on
cooperating,

00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:28.968
but then after the second
period you gave up and started

00:58:28.968 --> 00:58:30.503
defecting.
If it had gone on to the fourth

00:58:30.503 --> 00:58:32.139
period what would you have done?
Student: Defected.

00:58:32.139 --> 00:58:33.108
Professor Ben Polak:
 You would have defected

00:58:33.108 --> 00:58:34.769
again, all right.
Fifth period?

00:58:34.769 --> 00:58:36.487
Student: Well if she
kept defecting,

00:58:36.487 --> 00:58:38.656
I would keep defecting.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:58:38.656 --> 00:58:40.900
 All right,
so what Patrick's saying is he

00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.592
started off cooperating but once
he saw that Brooke was

00:58:43.592 --> 00:58:45.362
defecting,
he was going to switch to

00:58:45.362 --> 00:58:47.053
defect.
And basically as long as she

00:58:47.053 --> 00:58:49.196
went on defecting,
he was going to stick with

00:58:49.196 --> 00:58:51.679
defecting.
Let's try a different pair.

00:58:51.679 --> 00:58:53.570
So why don't we switch it over
to your partners there.

00:58:53.570 --> 00:59:00.580
So Ben here and Edwina.

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:12.033
So why don't you stand up.
I want everybody to see these

00:59:12.033 --> 00:59:14.210
people.
So stand up a second.

00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:17.478
So these are our players,
I want people at the back to

00:59:17.478 --> 00:59:20.931
essentially know who are
playing, this is Edwina and this

00:59:20.931 --> 00:59:24.134
is Ben.
So Edwina--sit down so you can

00:59:24.134 --> 00:59:28.287
actually write things down.
So Edwina and Ben,

00:59:28.287 --> 00:59:32.980
Edwina, have you both written
down a strategy?

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.100
Ben, have you written down a
strategy?

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:35.996
Edwina what did you choose?
Student: Cooperate.

00:59:35.996 --> 00:59:37.788
Professor Ben Polak:
 So Edwina's cooperating,

00:59:37.788 --> 00:59:40.046
Ben?
Student: Cooperate.

00:59:40.046 --> 00:59:44.389
Professor Ben Polak:
 Okay, let's toss the coin.

00:59:44.389 --> 00:59:49.030
So we're okay,
so we're still playing.

00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:50.260
Edwina?
Student: Cooperate.

00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:51.219
Professor Ben Polak:
 Ben?

00:59:51.219 --> 00:59:52.269
Student: I chose
cooperate.

00:59:52.269 --> 00:59:54.960
Professor Ben Polak:
 All right,

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:57.842
so they're cooperating.
Tails again,

00:59:57.842 --> 01:00:01.300
so you're still playing.
Student: Cooperate.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.820
Student: Cooperate.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.219
 All right,
so they're still cooperating.

01:00:04.219 --> 01:00:06.070
Some pain in the voice this
time.

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:13.440
Heads and then tails,
write down what you're going to

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.320
do.
Edwina? Student: Defect.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.909
Professor Ben Polak:
 Ben.

01:00:16.909 --> 01:00:19.950
Student: Cooperate.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.090
Things were going so nicely
there.

01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:23.900
We had such a nice class going
on there–.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:29.740
All right, so we're still
playing.

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:33.603
Edwina? Student: Defect.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:00:33.603 --> 01:00:34.539
Ben?
Student: Defect.

01:00:34.539 --> 01:00:39.530
Professor Ben Polak:
 All right,

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:43.650
Jake?
Tails, tails, we're still going.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:46.449
Student: Defect.
Student: Defect.

01:00:46.449 --> 01:00:48.101
Professor Ben Polak:
 All right,

01:00:48.101 --> 01:00:50.275
let me stop it there,
we'll pretend that we had two

01:00:50.275 --> 01:00:51.789
heads.
So let's talk about this.

01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:54.888
We had some cooperation going
on here, both people started

01:00:54.888 --> 01:00:58.556
cooperating.
So Ben, why did you cooperate

01:00:58.556 --> 01:01:01.659
at the beginning?
Student: Well,

01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:04.937
going along with Patrick's
reasoning I felt that if we

01:01:04.937 --> 01:01:08.471
could have the cooperate,
cooperate in the long term with

01:01:08.471 --> 01:01:11.667
the 75% chance of continuing
playing, that it would be a

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.861
worthwhile investment.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:01:13.861 --> 01:01:15.086
 All right.
Student: Until I

01:01:15.086 --> 01:01:16.570
realized that Edwina had started
defecting.

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:18.050
Professor Ben Polak:
 Let's come back a second.

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:20.889
Let's get you guys to stand up
so people can hear you.

01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:22.400
When you stand up you shout
more.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:25.444
So stand up again.
Edwina, so you also started

01:01:25.444 --> 01:01:28.269
cooperating, why did you start
cooperating?

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:29.949
Student: For the same
reason.

01:01:29.949 --> 01:01:31.744
Professor Ben Polak:
Same reason,

01:01:31.744 --> 01:01:33.262
okay.
So the key thing here is why

01:01:33.262 --> 01:01:36.032
did you start defecting?
You heard the big sigh in the

01:01:36.032 --> 01:01:38.190
class.
Why did you start defecting at

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:40.142
this stage?
Student: Because we'd

01:01:40.142 --> 01:01:42.520
had so many, I mean the coin
toss had to come to heads,

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.325
heads sometime,
so I started thinking that

01:01:44.325 --> 01:01:46.923
maybe- Professor Ben Polak:
The reversion to the mean

01:01:46.923 --> 01:01:48.296
of the coin.
Student: Yeah,

01:01:48.296 --> 01:01:57.199
I just thought that it.
I thought, I mean, I don't know.

01:01:57.199 --> 01:01:58.703
Professor Ben Polak:
So what did I say about the

01:01:58.703 --> 01:02:00.289
relationships of Economic majors
that are in the class?

01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:04.019
Anyway, all right,
so Edwina defected and then Ben

01:02:04.019 --> 01:02:07.139
you switched after,
why did you switch?

01:02:07.139 --> 01:02:10.937
Student: Because once
Edwina started defecting I felt

01:02:10.937 --> 01:02:14.670
that we'd revert back to the
defect, defect equilibrium.

01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:16.779
Professor Ben Polak:
All right,

01:02:16.779 --> 01:02:20.389
so thank you guys.
So there's another good

01:02:20.389 --> 01:02:23.443
strategy here.
People started off cooperating

01:02:23.443 --> 01:02:26.136
and I claim that at least
Ben--Ben can contradict me in a

01:02:26.136 --> 01:02:28.878
second--but I think Ben's
strategy here was something like

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:31.494
this.
I'm going to cooperate and I'm

01:02:31.494 --> 01:02:35.550
going to go on cooperating as
long as we're cooperating.

01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:39.880
But if at some point Edwina
defects--or for that matter I

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:44.520
defect--then this relationship's
over and we're going to play

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.702
defect forever.
Is that right?

01:02:46.702 --> 01:02:49.400
That's kind of a rough
description of your strategy?

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.099
Edwina was more or less playing
the same thing.

01:02:53.099 --> 01:02:55.993
In fact it was her who
defected, but once she defected

01:02:55.993 --> 01:02:59.160
she realized that it was over
and she went on defecting.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.485
So this strategy has a name.
Let's just be clear what the

01:03:03.485 --> 01:03:13.560
strategy is.
This strategy says play C which

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:26.012
is cooperate,
and then play C if no one has

01:03:26.012 --> 01:03:35.140
played D;
and play D otherwise.

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:39.277
So start off by cooperating.
Keep cooperating as long as

01:03:39.277 --> 01:03:42.353
nobody's cheated.
But if somebody cheats,

01:03:42.353 --> 01:03:45.731
this relationship's over:
we're just going to defect

01:03:45.731 --> 01:03:47.902
forever.
Now this strategy is a famous

01:03:47.902 --> 01:03:50.350
strategy.
It has a name.

01:03:50.350 --> 01:04:01.820
Anyone know what the name is?
This is called the "Grim

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:10.765
Trigger Strategy."
So this strategy again,

01:04:10.765 --> 01:04:15.156
it says we're going to
cooperate, but if that

01:04:15.156 --> 01:04:19.968
cooperation breaks down ever,
even if it's me who breaks it

01:04:19.968 --> 01:04:22.480
down, then I'm just going to
defect forever.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.477
Now, we're going to come back
next time to see if this is an

01:04:29.477 --> 01:04:30.780
equilibrium, but there's a few
things to do first.

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:33.940
First let's just check that it
actually is a strategy.

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:36.349
What does it mean to be a
strategy again?

01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:41.399
It has to tell us what to do at
every information set I could

01:04:41.399 --> 01:04:44.836
find myself at.
And this game is potentially

01:04:44.836 --> 01:04:48.633
infinite, so potentially there's
an infinite number of

01:04:48.633 --> 01:04:53.044
information sets I could reach.
So you might think that writing

01:04:53.044 --> 01:04:56.803
down a strategy that gives me an
instruction at every single

01:04:56.803 --> 01:05:00.625
information set is going to be
incredibly complicated once we

01:05:00.625 --> 01:05:03.619
go to games that are potentially
infinite,

01:05:03.619 --> 01:05:06.099
because there needs to be an
infinite number of instructions.

01:05:06.099 --> 01:05:08.639
But it turns out,
actually it's possible to write

01:05:08.639 --> 01:05:11.496
down such strategies rather
simply, at least if they're

01:05:11.496 --> 01:05:14.059
simple strategies.
This example is one.

01:05:14.059 --> 01:05:17.186
This tells me what to do at the
first information set,

01:05:17.186 --> 01:05:19.887
it says play C.
It then tells me for every

01:05:19.887 --> 01:05:23.675
information set I find myself
at, in which only cooperation

01:05:23.675 --> 01:05:26.809
has ever occurred in the history
of the game,

01:05:26.809 --> 01:05:29.530
I'm going to go on cooperating:
play C.

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:33.222
And it says for all other
histories, for all other

01:05:33.222 --> 01:05:36.990
information sets I might find
myself at, play D.

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:42.184
So it really is a strategy.
Now this is very different

01:05:42.184 --> 01:05:47.427
behavior--we played with the
same players--this kind of

01:05:47.427 --> 01:05:51.829
behavior is very different,
in both games actually,

01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:55.586
is very different than the
behavior we saw in the game that

01:05:55.586 --> 01:05:57.361
ended,
the game with two periods or

01:05:57.361 --> 01:06:00.323
three periods.
What is it essentially that

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:03.650
made this different?
What's different about this way

01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:06.643
of playing Prisoner's Dilemma,
where we had Jake toss the coin

01:06:06.643 --> 01:06:09.488
versus the way we played before
and we just played for five

01:06:09.488 --> 01:06:14.400
periods and then stopped?
What's different about it?

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:18.528
Somebody?
Let's talk to our players,

01:06:18.528 --> 01:06:23.352
Patrick why is this different?
Student: We don't when

01:06:23.352 --> 01:06:25.657
the game is going to end or if
it's going to end,

01:06:25.657 --> 01:06:28.072
so there's no last period.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:06:28.072 --> 01:06:30.027
Good, so our analysis of
the game before,

01:06:30.027 --> 01:06:32.560
the analysis of the Prisoner's
Dilemma when we knew it was

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.203
going to end after two periods,
after five periods,

01:06:35.203 --> 01:06:37.785
whatever it was,
was we all knew it was going to

01:06:37.785 --> 01:06:39.945
end.
There was a clearly defined

01:06:39.945 --> 01:06:41.848
last period.
When people are going to

01:06:41.848 --> 01:06:44.469
retire, we know the month in
which they're going to retire.

01:06:44.469 --> 01:06:47.201
When President's are going to
step down, we know they're going

01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:49.503
to step down that period.
When CEO's are going to go,

01:06:49.503 --> 01:06:51.974
we know they're going to go--or
acctually we don't always know

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:54.079
they're going to go but let's
just pretend we do.

01:06:54.079 --> 01:06:58.661
So what's different about this
game is, every time we play the

01:06:58.661 --> 01:07:02.719
game, there is a probability,
in this case a .75 probability

01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:05.889
that the game is going to
continue to the next period.

01:07:05.889 --> 01:07:11.012
Every time we play the game,
with probability of .75 there's

01:07:11.012 --> 01:07:15.650
going to be a future.
There's no obvious last period

01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:21.019
from which we can unravel the
game in the way we did before.

01:07:21.019 --> 01:07:23.072
Just to remind ourselves,
the way in which

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:25.977
cooperation--our analysis of
cooperation--broke down in the

01:07:25.977 --> 01:07:28.030
finitely repeated Prisoner's
Dilemma,

01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:30.065
was when we looked at the last
period, we know people are going

01:07:30.065 --> 01:07:32.143
to defect.
And once that thread is loose

01:07:32.143 --> 01:07:35.219
we can unravel it all the way
back to the beginning.

01:07:35.219 --> 01:07:39.630
But here, since there is no
last period that unraveling

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:44.998
argument never gets to hold.
Now instead we're able to see

01:07:44.998 --> 01:07:50.030
strategies emerge like the Grim
Trigger Strategy,

01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:52.674
and notice that the Grim
Trigger Strategy has a pretty

01:07:52.674 --> 01:07:55.119
good chance of actually
sustaining cooperation.

01:07:55.119 --> 01:07:58.518
So in particular,
as long as people play this

01:07:58.518 --> 01:08:02.767
strategy they are cooperating.
It turns out that Edwina

01:08:02.767 --> 01:08:06.619
eventually gave up that
strategy, but had she gone on

01:08:06.619 --> 01:08:10.989
playing it, they would have gone
on cooperating forever.

01:08:10.989 --> 01:08:13.925
But of course there's a
question here,

01:08:13.925 --> 01:08:18.210
and the question is:
is this in fact an equilibrium?

01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:21.048
We know that if people play
this way, we get cooperation,

01:08:21.048 --> 01:08:24.191
but the question--the thousand
dollar question or whatever--is:

01:08:24.191 --> 01:08:27.764
is this an equilibrium?
So what do we have to do check

01:08:27.764 --> 01:08:30.630
whether this is an equilibrium
or not?

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:40.460
We have to mimic the argument
we had before.

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:45.252
We have to compare the
temptation to defect today and

01:08:45.252 --> 01:08:50.874
compare that with the value of
the reward (to cooperating) and

01:08:50.874 --> 01:08:56.220
the value of the punishment
(from defecting) tomorrow.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:59.199
So this basic idea is going to
re-emerge.

01:08:59.199 --> 01:09:01.446
Having said that,
let me now delete it so I have

01:09:01.446 --> 01:09:02.020
some room.

01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:10.194
To show this is an equilibrium,
we need to show that the

01:09:10.194 --> 01:09:14.448
temptation to defect--the
temptation to cheat in the short

01:09:14.448 --> 01:09:18.702
term--is outweighed by the
difference between the value of

01:09:18.702 --> 01:09:22.360
the reward and the value of the
punishment.

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:25.720
All right, so let's set that up.

01:09:29.569 --> 01:09:31.920
Let's put the temptation here
first.

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.114
So the temptation in Prisoner's
Dilemma, the temptation to cheat

01:09:36.114 --> 01:09:39.911
today is what?
I'll get 3 rather than 2,

01:09:39.911 --> 01:09:44.429
is that right?
So if I defect--when Edwina

01:09:44.429 --> 01:09:49.975
defected: here's Edwina
defecting in this period--she

01:09:49.975 --> 01:09:56.267
got a payoff of 3 rather than
the payoff of 2 she would have

01:09:56.267 --> 01:10:03.783
got from cooperating.
So the temptation here is just

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:12.479
3 - 2 and let's be clear,
this is a temptation today and

01:10:12.479 --> 01:10:22.124
we want to compare this with the
value of the reward minus the

01:10:22.124 --> 01:10:32.149
value of the punishment,
but the key observation is that

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:39.009
these occur tomorrow.
So since they occur tomorrow we

01:10:39.009 --> 01:10:42.880
have to weight them a little bit
lower.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.181
So in general,
the way in which we're going to

01:10:45.181 --> 01:10:48.301
weight them tomorrow is we're
going to discount them just like

01:10:48.301 --> 01:10:53.854
we did in our bargaining game.
We're going to weight

01:10:53.854 --> 01:11:01.483
tomorrow's payments by δ,
where δ

01:11:01.483 --> 01:11:06.020
&lt; 1.
Now why is δ &lt; 1?

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:11.000
Why are we weighing tomorrow
less than payment today?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.220
Why are payments tomorrow worth
less than payments today?

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.050
Because tomorrow might not
happen.

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:19.819
There are other reasons why,
by the way.

01:11:19.819 --> 01:11:21.737
It might be that we are
impatient to get the money

01:11:21.737 --> 01:11:23.280
today.
Edwina just wanted the payoff

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.868
in a hurry, or it might be that
she wanted to take the payment

01:11:25.868 --> 01:11:27.989
today and put it in the bank and
earn interest.

01:11:27.989 --> 01:11:30.414
There are other reasons why
money today might be more

01:11:30.414 --> 01:11:32.844
valuable than money tomorrow,
but, in games,

01:11:32.844 --> 01:11:36.710
the most important reason is:
tomorrow may not happen.

01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:39.553
By tomorrow you might be dead,
or, if not dead,

01:11:39.553 --> 01:11:42.520
at least Jake's thrown two
heads in the coins.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:51.960
So δ is less than 1
because the game may end.

01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:58.569
Now, what's the value of the
reward?

01:11:58.569 --> 01:12:03.218
The value of the reward is
going to be the value of C "for

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:07.539
ever," but you want to be
careful about "for ever."

01:12:07.539 --> 01:12:10.273
It's C for ever,
but of course it isn't really

01:12:10.273 --> 01:12:12.460
for ever because the game may
end.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:15.729
So by "for ever" I mean until
the game ends.

01:12:15.729 --> 01:12:18.351
Let me be a bit more careful
actually, it's (C,

01:12:18.351 --> 01:12:20.892
C) isn't it?
The value of (C,

01:12:20.892 --> 01:12:25.029
C)--(cooperate,
cooperate)--for ever.

01:12:25.029 --> 01:12:33.609
Here we're going to have the
value of (D, D) for ever.

01:12:33.609 --> 01:12:37.467
And once again,
the for ever here means until

01:12:37.467 --> 01:12:41.087
the game ends.
So this is the calculation

01:12:41.087 --> 01:12:45.711
we're going to have to do.
We're going to have to compare

01:12:45.711 --> 01:12:47.956
the temptation,
that was easy,

01:12:47.956 --> 01:12:52.058
that was just 1 with the
discounted difference between

01:12:52.058 --> 01:12:56.470
the value of cooperation and the
value of defecting.

01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:59.029
Let's do the easy bits now,
and then we'll leave you in

01:12:59.029 --> 01:13:01.550
suspense until Wednesday.
So let's do all the easy bits.

01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:04.909
So what's this δ
in this case?

01:13:04.909 --> 01:13:09.811
In this particular game what
was the probability that the

01:13:09.811 --> 01:13:13.960
game was going to continue?
What was the probability that

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.842
the game was going to end?
The probability of it ending

01:13:18.842 --> 01:13:22.587
was .25, so δ
here was .75,

01:13:22.587 --> 01:13:26.744
that's easy.
The second bit that's

01:13:26.744 --> 01:13:32.216
relatively easy is what's the
value of playing (D,

01:13:32.216 --> 01:13:37.197
D) until the game ends?
Once people have cheated you're

01:13:37.197 --> 01:13:41.420
going to play D for ever--here
we are: Edwina's cheating here.

01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:42.826
You're going to get (D,
D) in this period,

01:13:42.826 --> 01:13:44.542
(D, D) in this period,
and so on and so forth until

01:13:44.542 --> 01:13:48.926
the game ends.
In each of those periods you're

01:13:48.926 --> 01:13:53.300
going to earn 0,
so this is just 0.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:14:00.959
Which leaves us with a messy
bit: what's the value of

01:14:00.959 --> 01:14:05.920
cooperating forever?
Let's try and do it.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.130
We've got one minute.
Let's do it.

01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:11.409
So in every period in which we
both cooperate what do we earn?

01:14:11.409 --> 01:14:17.281
Throughout the beginning of the
game: we cooperated in the first

01:14:17.281 --> 01:14:19.097
period;
now in the second period,

01:14:19.097 --> 01:14:22.844
we cooperate again.
What payoff do we get from

01:14:22.844 --> 01:14:27.502
cooperating again?
We get 2 and then Jake tosses

01:14:27.502 --> 01:14:32.402
his coin and with probability
δ we continue and we're

01:14:32.402 --> 01:14:36.890
going to cooperate again.
So with probability δ

01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:41.369
we cooperate again and get what
payoff the next period?

01:14:41.369 --> 01:14:44.825
2 again, and then Jakes tosses
the coin again,

01:14:44.825 --> 01:14:47.590
so now he's tossed the coin
twice,

01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:51.078
so with probability
δ² we're still playing

01:14:51.078 --> 01:14:54.019
and we get 2,
and then Jakes tosses the coin

01:14:54.019 --> 01:14:56.960
again and it comes up other than
heads,

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.445
heads again,
that's with probability

01:14:59.445 --> 01:15:01.860
δ³ we get 2 and so on.

01:15:02.689 --> 01:15:06.981
So your exercise between now
and Wednesday is to figure out

01:15:06.981 --> 01:15:11.124
what the value of cooperation
forever is: figure out this

01:15:11.124 --> 01:15:15.416
equation and find whether in
fact it was an equilibrium for

01:15:15.416 --> 01:15:19.000
people to cooperate.
We'll pick it up on Wednesday.

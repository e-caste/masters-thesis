00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.322
Professor Robert Shiller:
Today I want to spend--The

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:15.571
title of today's lecture is:
The Universal Principle of Risk

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:21.140
Management,
Pooling and the Hedging of Risk.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.008
What I'm really referring to is
what I think is the very

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.440
original, the deep concept that
underlies theoretical finance--I

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.111
wanted to get that first.
It really is probability theory

00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:38.610
and the idea of spreading risk
through risk pooling.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.553
So, this idea is an
intellectual construct that

00:00:44.553 --> 00:00:51.659
appeared at a certain point in
history and it has had an

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:59.800
amazing number of applications
and finance is one of these.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.829
Some of you--This incidentally
will be a more technical of my

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.926
lectures and it's a little bit
unfortunate that it comes early

00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:10.684
in the semester.
For those of you who have had a

00:01:10.684 --> 00:01:12.967
course in probability and
statistics, there will be

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:15.951
nothing new here.
Well, nothing in terms of the

00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:18.220
math.
The probability theory is new.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.374
Others though,
I want to tell you that it

00:01:21.374 --> 00:01:26.184
doesn't--if you're shopping--I
had a student come by yesterday

00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:30.916
and ask--he's a little rusty in
his math skills--if he should

00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:34.027
take this course.
I said, "Well if you can

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:36.406
understand tomorrow's
lecture--that's today's

00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:38.840
lecture--then you should have no
problem."

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.670
I want to start with the
concept of probability.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.040
Do you know what a probability
is?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.290
We attach a probability to an
event.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.955
What is the probability that
the stock market will go up this

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:07.198
year?
I would say--my personal

00:02:07.198 --> 00:02:12.771
probability is .45.
That's because I'm a bear

00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:16.159
but--Do you know what that
means?

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.678
That 45 times out of 100 the
stock market will go up and the

00:02:20.678 --> 00:02:25.350
other 55 times out of 100 it
will stay the same or go down.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.282
That's a probability.
Now, you're familiar with that

00:02:31.282 --> 00:02:35.326
concept, right?
If someone says the probability

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:39.150
is .55 or .45,
well you know what that means.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.208
I want to emphasize that it
hasn't always been that way and

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:51.789
that probability is really a
concept that arose in the 1600s.

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:55.759
Before that,
nobody ever said that.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.317
Ian Hacking,
who wrote a history of

00:02:59.317 --> 00:03:03.607
probability theory,
searched through world

00:03:03.607 --> 00:03:09.781
literature for any reference to
a probability and could find

00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:15.819
none anywhere before 1600.
There was an intellectual leap

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.017
that occurred in the seventeenth
century and it became very

00:03:21.017 --> 00:03:25.409
fashionable to talk in terms of
probabilities.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.720
It spread throughout the
world--the idea of quoting

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.000
probabilities.
But it was--It's funny that

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.620
such a simple idea hadn't been
used before.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.488
Hacking points out that the
word probability--or

00:03:39.488 --> 00:03:43.440
probable--was already in the
English language.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.789
In fact, Shakespeare used it,
but what do you think it meant?

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:53.683
He gives an example of a young
woman, who was describing a man

00:03:53.683 --> 00:03:55.929
that she liked,
and she said,

00:03:55.929 --> 00:04:00.020
I like him very much,
I find him very probable.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.409
What do you think she means?
Can someone answer that?

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.350
Does anyone know Elizabethan
English well enough to tell me?

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.310
What is a probable young man?
I'm asking for an answer.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.320
It sounds like people have no
idea.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.320
Can anyone venture a guess?
No one wants to venture a guess?

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.348
Student: fertile?
Professor Robert

00:04:30.348 --> 00:04:33.350
Shiller: That he can father
children?

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.019
I don't think that's what she
meant but maybe.

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:46.209
No, what apparently she meant
is trustworthy.

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:48.889
That's a very important quality
in a person I suppose.

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.294
So, if something is probable
you mean that you can trust it

00:04:53.294 --> 00:04:56.560
and so probability means
trustworthiness.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.522
You can see how they moved from
that definition of probability

00:05:01.522 --> 00:05:03.800
to the current definition.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.949
But Ian Hacking,
being a good historian,

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.298
thought that someone must have
had some concept of probability

00:05:14.298 --> 00:05:17.297
going before,
even if they didn't quote it as

00:05:17.297 --> 00:05:20.758
a number the way--it must have
been in their head or in their

00:05:20.758 --> 00:05:23.389
idea.
He searched through world

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:28.511
literature to try to find some
use of the term that preceded

00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:33.892
the 1600s and he concluded that
there were probably a number of

00:05:33.892 --> 00:05:39.261
people who had the idea,
but they didn't publish it,

00:05:39.261 --> 00:05:45.598
and it never became part of the
established literature partly

00:05:45.598 --> 00:05:48.806
because,
he said, throughout human

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:53.474
history, there has been a love
of gambling and probability

00:05:53.474 --> 00:05:57.649
theory is extremely useful if
you are a gambler.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:02.713
Hacking believes that there
were many gambling theorists who

00:06:02.713 --> 00:06:07.690
invented probability theory at
various times in history but

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.810
never wrote it down and kept it
as a secret.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:22.258
He gives an example--I like
to--he gives an example from a

00:06:22.258 --> 00:06:30.139
book that--or it's a
collection--I think,

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:35.121
a collection of epic poems
written in Sanskrit that goes

00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:40.645
back--it was actually written
over a course of 1,000 years and

00:06:40.645 --> 00:06:44.540
it was completed in the fourth
century.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.517
Well, there's a story--there's
a long story in the Mahabarahta

00:06:50.517 --> 00:06:56.495
about an emperor called Nala and
he had a wife named Damayanti

00:06:56.495 --> 00:07:01.199
and he was a very pure and very
good person.

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:07.849
There was an evil demon called
Kali who hated Nala and wanted

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:13.722
to bring his downfall,
so he had to find a weakness of

00:07:13.722 --> 00:07:16.493
Nala.
He found finally some,

00:07:16.493 --> 00:07:21.008
even though Nala was so pure
and so perfect--he found one

00:07:21.008 --> 00:07:25.527
weakness and that was gambling.
Nala couldn't resist the

00:07:25.527 --> 00:07:30.226
opportunity to gamble;
so the evil demon seduced him

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:34.700
into gambling aggressively.
You know sometimes when you're

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.809
losing and you redouble and you
keep hoping to win back what

00:07:37.809 --> 00:07:40.594
you've lost?
In a fit of gambling,

00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:45.817
Nala finally gambled his entire
kingdom and lost--it's a

00:07:45.817 --> 00:07:51.610
terrible story--and Nala then
had to leave the kingdom and his

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.259
wife.
They wandered for years.

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:57.009
He separated from her because
of dire necessity.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:00.688
They were wandering in the
forests and he was in despair,

00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:05.425
having lost everything.
But then he meets someone by

00:08:05.425 --> 00:08:10.620
the name of--we have Nala and he
meets this man,

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:17.142
Rituparna, and this is where a
probability theory apparently

00:08:17.142 --> 00:08:21.152
comes in.
Rituparna tells Nala that he

00:08:21.152 --> 00:08:26.430
knows the science of gambling
and he will teach it to Nala,

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.128
but that it has to be done by
whispering it in his ear because

00:08:31.128 --> 00:08:35.549
it's a deep and extreme secret.
Nala is skeptical.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.240
How does Rituparna know how to
gamble?

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.274
So Rituparna tries to prove to
him his abilities and he says,

00:08:43.274 --> 00:08:47.220
see that tree there,
I can estimate how many leaves

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.210
there are on that tree by
counting leaves on one branch.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:56.960
Rituparna looked at one branch
and estimated the number of

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.500
leaves on the tree,
but Nala was skeptical.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.297
He stayed up all night and
counted every leaf on the tree

00:09:06.297 --> 00:09:10.409
and it came very close to what
Rituparna said;

00:09:10.409 --> 00:09:18.320
so he--the next
morning--believed Rituparna.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.597
Now this is interesting,
Hacking says,

00:09:20.597 --> 00:09:23.982
because it shows that sampling
theory was part of Nala's

00:09:23.982 --> 00:09:26.482
theory.
You don't have to count all the

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:29.303
leaves on the tree,
you can take a sample and you

00:09:29.303 --> 00:09:31.419
count that and then you
multiply.

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:36.175
Anyway, the story ends and Nala
goes back and is now armed with

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:38.629
probability theory,
we assume.

00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:42.387
He goes back and gambles again,
but he has nothing left to

00:09:42.387 --> 00:09:47.860
wager except his wife;
so he puts her and gambles her.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.389
But remember,
now he knows what he's doing

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:54.214
and so he really wasn't gambling
his wife--he was really a very

00:09:54.214 --> 00:09:58.496
pure and honorable man.
So he won back the entire

00:09:58.496 --> 00:10:03.461
kingdom and that's the ending.
Anyway, that shows that I think

00:10:03.461 --> 00:10:05.960
probability theory does have a
long history,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.143
but--it not being an
intellectual discipline--it

00:10:10.143 --> 00:10:14.950
didn't really inform a
generation of finance theory.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.364
When you don't have a theory,
then you don't have a way to be

00:10:18.364 --> 00:10:21.840
rigorous.
So, it was in the 1600s that

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:28.050
probability theory started to
get written down as a theory and

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:33.139
many things then happened in
that century that,

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:36.539
I think, are precursors both to
finance and insurance.

00:10:36.539 --> 00:10:41.272
One was in the 1600s when
people started constructing life

00:10:41.272 --> 00:10:43.360
tables.
What is a life table?

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.779
It's a table showing the
probability of dying at each

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:51.935
age, for each age and sex.
That's what you need to know if

00:10:51.935 --> 00:10:53.940
you're going to do life
insurance.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.543
So, they started to do
collecting of data on mortality

00:10:57.543 --> 00:11:01.350
and they developed something
called actuarial science,

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.280
which is estimating the
probability of people living.

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:15.429
That then became the basis for
insurance.

00:11:15.429 --> 00:11:20.549
Actually, insurance goes back
to ancient Rome in some form.

00:11:20.549 --> 00:11:23.903
In ancient Rome they had
something called burial

00:11:23.903 --> 00:11:27.361
insurance.
You could buy a policy that

00:11:27.361 --> 00:11:32.757
protected you against your
family not having the money to

00:11:32.757 --> 00:11:36.579
bury you if you died.
In ancient culture people

00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:39.476
worried a great deal about being
properly buried,

00:11:39.476 --> 00:11:41.649
so that's an interesting
concept.

00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:44.039
They were selling that in
ancient Rome;

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:47.730
but you might think,
but why just for burial?

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.710
Why don't you make it into
full-blown life insurance?

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.580
You kind of wonder why they
didn't.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.870
I think maybe it's because they
didn't have the concepts down.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.789
In Renaissance Italy they
started writing insurance

00:11:59.789 --> 00:12:03.629
policies--I read one of the
insurance policies,

00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:07.410
it's in the Journal of Risk and
Insurance--and they translate a

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.068
Renaissance insurance policy and
it's very hard to understand

00:12:11.068 --> 00:12:15.092
what this policy was saying.
I guess they didn't have our

00:12:15.092 --> 00:12:19.607
language, they didn't--they were
intuitively halfway there but

00:12:19.607 --> 00:12:23.720
they couldn't express it,
so I think the industry didn't

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.119
get really started.
I think it was the invention of

00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:30.869
probability theory that really
started it and that's why I

00:12:30.869 --> 00:12:33.830
think theory is very important
in finance.

00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:42.929
Some people date fire insurance
with the fire of London in 1666.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.947
The whole city burned down,
practically,

00:12:45.947 --> 00:12:50.511
in a terrible fire and fire
insurance started to proliferate

00:12:50.511 --> 00:12:53.644
right after that in London.
But you know,

00:12:53.644 --> 00:12:57.090
you kind of wonder if that's a
good example for fire insurance

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.350
because if the whole city burns
down,

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.782
then insurance companies would
go bankrupt anyway,

00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:03.719
right?
London insurance companies

00:13:03.719 --> 00:13:07.093
would because the whole concept
of insurance is pooling of

00:13:07.093 --> 00:13:08.810
independent probabilities.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.700
Nonetheless,
that was the beginning.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:20.042
We're also going to recognize,
however, that insurance got a

00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:25.476
slow start because--I believe it
is because--people could not

00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:29.279
understand the concept of
probability.

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:35.020
They didn't have the concept
firmly in mind.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.592
There are lots of aspects to it.
In order to understand

00:13:38.592 --> 00:13:43.747
probability, you have to take
things as coming from a random

00:13:43.747 --> 00:13:49.078
event and people don't clearly
have that in their mind from an

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:53.443
intuitive standpoint.
They have maybe a sense that I

00:13:53.443 --> 00:13:57.350
can influence events by willing
or wishing and if I think

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.769
that--if I have kind of a
mystical side to me,

00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:04.700
then probabilities don't have a
clear meaning.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:10.730
It has been shown that even
today people seem to think that.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:16.835
They don't really take,
at an intuitive level,

00:14:16.835 --> 00:14:21.397
probabilities as objective.
For example,

00:14:21.397 --> 00:14:24.480
if you ask people how much they
would be willing to bet on a

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.404
coin toss,
they will typically bet more if

00:14:27.404 --> 00:14:31.894
they can toss the coin or they
will bet more if the coin hasn't

00:14:31.894 --> 00:14:34.797
been tossed yet.
It could have been already

00:14:34.797 --> 00:14:37.919
tossed and concealed.
Why would that be?

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:43.436
It might be that there's just
some intuitive sense that I

00:14:43.436 --> 00:14:49.346
can--I don't know--I have some
magical forces in me and I can

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:52.966
change things.
The idea of probability theory

00:14:52.966 --> 00:14:56.350
is that no, you can't change
things, there are all these

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.350
objective laws of probability
out there that guide everything.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:10.378
Most languages around the world
have a different word for luck

00:15:10.378 --> 00:15:17.779
and risk--or luck and fortune.
Luck seems to mean something

00:15:17.779 --> 00:15:20.529
about you: like I'm a lucky
person.

00:15:20.529 --> 00:15:23.494
I don't know what that
means--like God or the gods

00:15:23.494 --> 00:15:26.639
favor me and so I'm lucky or
this is my lucky day.

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:31.220
Probability theory is really a
movement away from that.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:38.659
We then have a mathematically
rigorous discipline.

00:15:38.659 --> 00:15:45.487
Now, I'm going to go through
some of the terms of probability

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:50.379
and--this will be review for
many of you,

00:15:50.379 --> 00:15:56.012
but it will be something that
we're going to use in the--So

00:15:56.012 --> 00:16:02.033
I'll use the symbol P or
I can sometimes write it out as

00:16:02.033 --> 00:16:06.210
prob to represent a
probability.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:11.977
It is always a number that lies
between zero and one,

00:16:11.977 --> 00:16:17.873
or between 0% and 100%.
"Percent" means divided by 100

00:16:17.873 --> 00:16:24.610
in Latin, so 100% is one.
If the probability is zero that

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:30.407
means the event can't happen.
If the probability is one,

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:33.179
it means that it's certain to
happen.

00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:36.220
If the probability is--Can
everyone see this from over

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.995
there?
I can probably move this or

00:16:39.995 --> 00:16:41.980
can't I?
Yes, I can.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.300
Now, can you now--you're the
most disadvantaged person and

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.120
you can see it,
right?

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:58.900
So that's the basic idea.
One of the first principles of

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.320
probability is the idea of
independence.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:17.583
The idea is that probability
measures the likelihood of some

00:17:17.583 --> 00:17:20.751
outcome.
Let's say the outcome of an

00:17:20.751 --> 00:17:24.488
experiment, like tossing a coin.
You might say the probability

00:17:24.488 --> 00:17:27.678
that you toss a coin and it
comes up heads is a half,

00:17:27.678 --> 00:17:30.930
because it's equally likely to
be heads and tails.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:36.282
Independent experiments are
experiments that occur without

00:17:36.282 --> 00:17:40.553
relation to each other.
If you toss a coin twice and

00:17:40.553 --> 00:17:43.920
the first experiment doesn't
influence the second,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.111
we say they're independent and
there's no relation between the

00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:51.180
two.
One of the first principles of

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.590
probability theory is called the
multiplication rule.

00:18:00.569 --> 00:18:03.735
That says that if you have
independent probabilities,

00:18:03.735 --> 00:18:07.206
then the probability of two
events is equal to the product

00:18:07.206 --> 00:18:14.626
of their probabilities.
So, the Prob(A and

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:22.020
B) = Prob(A)*Prob(B).

00:18:28.309 --> 00:18:32.869
That wouldn't hold if
they're not independent.

00:18:32.869 --> 00:18:38.081
The theory of insurance is that
ideally an insurance company

00:18:38.081 --> 00:18:41.349
wants to insure independent
events.

00:18:41.349 --> 00:18:44.464
Ideally, life insurance is
insuring people--or fire

00:18:44.464 --> 00:18:47.454
insurance is insuring
people--against independent

00:18:47.454 --> 00:18:50.380
events;
so it's not the fire of London.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.516
It's the problem that sometimes
people knock over an oil lamp in

00:18:55.516 --> 00:18:59.430
their home and they burn their
own house down.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.391
It's not going to burn any
other houses down since it's

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:04.970
just completely independent of
anything else.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.722
So, the probability that the
whole city burns down is

00:19:08.722 --> 00:19:10.960
infinitesimally small,
right?

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.574
This will generalize to
probability of A and

00:19:13.574 --> 00:19:16.765
B and C equals the
probability of A times

00:19:16.765 --> 00:19:19.432
the probability of B
times the probability of

00:19:19.432 --> 00:19:22.529
C and so on.
If the probability is 1 in

00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:26.519
1,000 that a house burns down
and there are 1,000 houses,

00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:31.912
then the probability that they
all burn down is 1/1000 to the

00:19:31.912 --> 00:19:34.799
1000th power,
which is virtually zero.

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.635
So insurance companies
then–Basically,

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:40.669
if they write a lot of
policies, then they have

00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:45.164
virtually no risk.
That is the fundamental idea

00:19:45.164 --> 00:19:52.015
that may seem simple and obvious
to you, but it certainly wasn't

00:19:52.015 --> 00:19:55.930
back when the idea first came
up.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:59.086
Incidentally,
we have a problem set,

00:19:59.086 --> 00:20:04.767
which I want you to start today
and it will be due not in a week

00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:08.621
this time,
because we have Martin Luther

00:20:08.621 --> 00:20:12.911
King Day coming up,
but it will be due the Monday

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:14.520
following that.

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:27.616
If you follow through from the
independent theory,

00:20:27.616 --> 00:20:31.139
there's one of the basic
relations in probability

00:20:31.139 --> 00:20:34.809
theory--it's called the binomial
distribution.

00:20:34.809 --> 00:20:42.880
I'm not going to spend a whole
lot of time on this but it gives

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:50.950
the probability of x
successes in n trials or,

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.579
in the case of insurance
x, if you're insuring

00:20:54.579 --> 00:20:57.720
against an accident,
then the probability that

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.490
you'll get x accidents
and n trials.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:12.414
The binomial distribution gives
the probability as a function of

00:21:12.414 --> 00:21:22.645
x and it's given by the
formula where P is the

00:21:22.645 --> 00:21:33.569
probability of the accident:
P^(X) (1-P)^(N-X) [n!/(n-x)!].

00:21:33.569 --> 00:21:37.990
That is the formula that
insurance companies use when

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.220
they have independent
probabilities,

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:47.228
to estimate the likelihood of
having a certain number of

00:21:47.228 --> 00:21:50.484
accidents.
They're concerned with having

00:21:50.484 --> 00:21:53.435
too many accidents,
which might exhaust their

00:21:53.435 --> 00:21:55.924
reserves.
An insurance company has

00:21:55.924 --> 00:21:59.714
reserves and it has enough
reserves to cover them for a

00:21:59.714 --> 00:22:03.598
certain number of accidents.
It uses the binomial

00:22:03.598 --> 00:22:08.296
distribution to calculate the
probability of getting any

00:22:08.296 --> 00:22:14.560
specific number of accidents.
So, that is the binomial

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.620
distribution.

00:22:21.109 --> 00:22:25.409
I'm not going to expand on this
because I can't get into--This

00:22:25.409 --> 00:22:29.708
is not a course in probability
theory but I'm hopeful that you

00:22:29.708 --> 00:22:32.880
can see the formula and you can
apply it.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.420
Any questions?
Is this clear enough?

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.480
Can you read my handwriting?

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.980
Another important concept in
probability theory that we will

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.770
use a lot is expected value,

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:56.448
the mean, or average--those are
all roughly interchangeable

00:22:56.448 --> 00:23:02.372
concepts.
We have expected value,

00:23:02.372 --> 00:23:06.010
mean or average.

00:23:14.369 --> 00:23:18.512
We can define it in a couple of
different ways depending on

00:23:18.512 --> 00:23:22.869
whether we're talking about
sample mean or population mean.

00:23:22.869 --> 00:23:28.198
The basic definition--the
expected value of some random

00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:34.512
variable x--E(x)--I guess
I should have said that a random

00:23:34.512 --> 00:23:39.150
variable is a quantity that
takes on value.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:43.471
If you have an experiment and
the outcome of the experiment is

00:23:43.471 --> 00:23:47.793
a number, then a random variable
is the number that comes from

00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:49.980
the experiment.
For example,

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.779
the experiment could be tossing
a coin;

00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:56.556
I will call the outcome
heads the number one,

00:23:56.556 --> 00:24:00.555
and I'll call the outcome
tails the number zero,

00:24:00.555 --> 00:24:03.740
so I've just defined a random
variable.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.245
You have discrete random
variables, like the one I just

00:24:07.245 --> 00:24:10.296
defined, or there are
also--which take on only a

00:24:10.296 --> 00:24:14.385
finite number of values--and we
have continuous random variables

00:24:14.385 --> 00:24:18.410
that can take on any number of
values along a continuum.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.372
Another experiment would be to
mix two chemicals together and

00:24:22.372 --> 00:24:25.740
put a thermometer in and measure
the temperature.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.848
That's another invention of the
1600s, by the way--the

00:24:28.848 --> 00:24:31.152
thermometer.
And they learned that

00:24:31.152 --> 00:24:34.470
concept--perfectly natural to
us--temperature.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.339
But it was a new idea in the
1600s.

00:24:37.339 --> 00:24:39.940
So anyway, that's continuous,
right?

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.892
When you mix two chemicals
together, it could be any

00:24:42.892 --> 00:24:46.191
number, there's an infinite
number of possible numbers and

00:24:46.191 --> 00:24:50.741
that would be continuous.
For discrete random variables,

00:24:50.741 --> 00:24:56.004
we can define the expected
value, or µ_x

00:24:56.004 --> 00:25:01.364
--that's the Greek letter
mu--as the summation i =

00:25:01.364 --> 00:25:08.993
1 to infinity of.
[P(x=x_i) times

00:25:08.993 --> 00:25:15.066
(x_i)].
I have it down that there might

00:25:15.066 --> 00:25:18.719
be an infinite number of
possible values for the random

00:25:18.719 --> 00:25:21.766
variable x.
In the case of the coin toss,

00:25:21.766 --> 00:25:24.571
there are only two,
but I'm saying in general there

00:25:24.571 --> 00:25:28.151
could be an infinite number.
But they're accountable and we

00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:31.833
can list all possible values
when they're discrete and form a

00:25:31.833 --> 00:25:34.779
probability weighted average of
the outcomes.

00:25:34.779 --> 00:25:36.670
That's called the expected
value.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:40.490
People also call that the mean
or the average.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:45.680
But, note that this is based on
theory.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.469
These are probabilities.
In order to compute using this

00:25:50.469 --> 00:25:55.450
formula you have to know the
true probabilities.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:26:00.060
There's another formula that
applies for a continuous random

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.904
variables and it's the same idea
except that--I'll also call it

00:26:04.904 --> 00:26:09.410
µ_x,
except that it's an integral.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:17.942
We have the integral from minus
infinity to plus infinity of

00:26:17.942 --> 00:26:22.579
F(x)*x*dx,
and that's really--you see it's

00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:25.687
the same thing because an
integral is analogous to a

00:26:25.687 --> 00:26:26.480
summation.

00:26:32.019 --> 00:26:35.319
Those are the two population
definitions.

00:26:35.319 --> 00:26:40.148
F(x) is the continuous
probability distribution for

00:26:40.148 --> 00:26:41.080
x.

00:26:45.589 --> 00:26:49.211
That's different when you have
continuous values--you don't

00:26:49.211 --> 00:26:52.021
have P (x =
x_i) because it's

00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:54.832
always zero.
The probability that the

00:26:54.832 --> 00:26:59.287
temperature is exactly 100°
is zero because it could be

00:26:59.287 --> 00:27:02.534
100.0001°
or something else and there's

00:27:02.534 --> 00:27:05.630
an infinite number of
possibilities.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:10.663
We have instead what's called a
probability density when we have

00:27:10.663 --> 00:27:14.675
continuous random variables.
You're not going to need to

00:27:14.675 --> 00:27:18.384
know a lot about this for this
course, but this is--I wanted to

00:27:18.384 --> 00:27:22.686
get the basic ideas down.
These are called population

00:27:22.686 --> 00:27:28.717
measures because they refer to
the whole population of possible

00:27:28.717 --> 00:27:33.289
outcomes and they measure the
probabilities.

00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:38.231
It's the truth,
but there are also sample

00:27:38.231 --> 00:27:40.931
means.
When you get--this is

00:27:40.931 --> 00:27:45.657
Rituparna, counting the leaves
on a tree--you can estimate,

00:27:45.657 --> 00:27:49.650
from a sample,
the population expected values.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:56.720
The population mean is often
written "x-bar."

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.787
If you have a sample with
n observations,

00:28:00.787 --> 00:28:04.682
it's the summation i = 1
to n of

00:28:04.682 --> 00:28:08.750
x_i/n--that's
the average.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.333
You know that formula, right?
You count n leaves--you

00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:17.813
count the number of leaves.
You have n branches on

00:28:17.813 --> 00:28:24.590
the tree and you count the
number of leaves and sum them

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.320
up.
One would be--I'm having a

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.302
little trouble putting this into
the Rituparna story,

00:28:31.302 --> 00:28:34.559
but you see the idea.
You know the average, I assume.

00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:40.046
That's the most elementary
concept and you could use it to

00:28:40.046 --> 00:28:45.630
estimate either a discreet or
continuous expected value.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:49.869
In finance, there's often
reference to another kind of

00:28:49.869 --> 00:28:53.869
average, which I want to refer
you to and which,

00:28:53.869 --> 00:28:58.049
in the Jeremy Siegel book,
a lot is made of this.

00:28:58.049 --> 00:29:05.279
The other kind of average is
called the geometric average.

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:16.142
We'll call that--I'll only show
the sample version of it G(x) =

00:29:16.142 --> 00:29:25.427
the product i = 1 to
n of (x_i

00:29:25.427 --> 00:29:29.010
)^(1/n).
Does everyone--Can you see that?

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:38.676
Instead of summing them and
dividing by M,

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:43.380
I multiply them all together
and take the n^(th) root of

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.942
them.
This is called the geometric

00:29:46.942 --> 00:29:51.829
average and it's used only for
positive numbers.

00:29:51.829 --> 00:29:54.776
So, if you have any negative
numbers you'd have a problem,

00:29:54.776 --> 00:29:56.473
right?
If you had one negative number

00:29:56.473 --> 00:29:58.869
in it, then the product would be
a negative number and,

00:29:58.869 --> 00:30:01.969
if you took a root of that,
then you might get an imaginary

00:30:01.969 --> 00:30:06.128
number.
We don't want to use it in that

00:30:06.128 --> 00:30:09.101
case.
There's an appendix to one of

00:30:09.101 --> 00:30:13.859
the chapters in Jeremy Siegel's
book where he says that one of

00:30:13.859 --> 00:30:18.772
the most important applications
of this theory is to measure how

00:30:18.772 --> 00:30:21.190
successful an investor is.

00:30:26.119 --> 00:30:30.030
Suppose someone is managing
money.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:34.853
Have they done well?
If so, you would say,

00:30:34.853 --> 00:30:37.795
"Well, they've been investing
money over a number of different

00:30:37.795 --> 00:30:39.809
years.
Let's take the average over all

00:30:39.809 --> 00:30:42.498
the different years."
Suppose someone has been

00:30:42.498 --> 00:30:46.287
investing money for n
years and x_i

00:30:46.287 --> 00:30:49.619
is the return on the investment
in a given year.

00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:51.440
What is their average
performance?

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.180
The natural thing to do would
be to average them up,

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.767
right?
But Jeremy says that maybe

00:30:57.767 --> 00:31:02.140
that's not a very good thing to
do.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:08.758
What he says you should do
instead is to take the geometric

00:31:08.758 --> 00:31:14.782
average of gross returns.
The return on an investment is

00:31:14.782 --> 00:31:20.274
how much you made from the
investment as a percent of the

00:31:20.274 --> 00:31:26.022
money invested.
The gross return is the return

00:31:26.022 --> 00:31:29.263
plus one.
The worst you can ever do

00:31:29.263 --> 00:31:33.319
investing is lose all of your
investment--lose 100%.

00:31:33.319 --> 00:31:38.350
If we add one to the return,
then you've got a number that's

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:43.039
never negative and we can then
use geometric returns.

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:47.375
Jeremy Siegel says that in
finance we should be using

00:31:47.375 --> 00:31:50.710
geometric and not arithmetic
averages.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:52.583
Why is that?
Well I'll tell you in very

00:31:52.583 --> 00:31:53.640
simple terms,
I think.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.572
Suppose someone is investing
your money and he announces,

00:31:57.572 --> 00:32:01.451
I have had very good returns.
I have invested and I've

00:32:01.451 --> 00:32:05.420
produced 20% a year for nine out
of the last ten years.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:09.670
You think that's great,
but what about the last year.

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:13.630
The guy says,
"Oh I lost 100% in that year."

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:16.480
You might say,
"Alright, that's good."

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.130
I would add up 20% a year for
nine years and than put in a

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:24.638
zero–no,
120 because it's gross return

00:32:24.638 --> 00:32:28.799
for nine years--and put in a
zero for one year.

00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:31.319
Maybe that doesn't look bad,
right?

00:32:31.319 --> 00:32:33.892
But think about it,
if you were investing your

00:32:33.892 --> 00:32:37.150
money with someone like that,
what did you end up with?

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.844
You ended up with nothing.
If they have one year when they

00:32:40.844 --> 00:32:43.185
lose everything,
it doesn't matter how much they

00:32:43.185 --> 00:32:46.891
made in the other years.
Jeremy says in the text that

00:32:46.891 --> 00:32:52.120
the geometric return is always
lower than the arithmetic return

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.410
unless all the numbers are the
same.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:33:02.480
It's a less optimistic version.
So, we should use that,

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:06.510
but people in finance resist
using that because it's a lower

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:10.198
number and when you're
advertising your return you want

00:33:10.198 --> 00:33:12.930
to make it look as big as
possible.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:17.063
We also need some measure
of--We've been talking here

00:33:17.063 --> 00:33:21.514
about measures of central
tendency only and in finance we

00:33:21.514 --> 00:33:24.659
need,
as well, measures of

00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:30.490
dispersion, which is how much
something varies.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:35.252
Central tendency is a measure
of the center of a probability

00:33:35.252 --> 00:33:40.015
distribution of the--Central
tendency is a measure--Variance

00:33:40.015 --> 00:33:44.939
is a measure of how much things
change from one observation to

00:33:44.939 --> 00:33:49.795
another.
We have variance and it's often

00:33:49.795 --> 00:33:56.765
represented by σ²,
that's the Greek letter sigma,

00:33:56.765 --> 00:34:03.780
lower case, squared.
Or, especially when talking

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:12.596
about estimates of the variance,
we sometimes say S²

00:34:12.596 --> 00:34:19.679
or we say standard
deviation².

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:22.909
The standard deviation is the
square root of the variance.

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:31.828
For population variance,
the variance of some random

00:34:31.828 --> 00:34:42.671
variable x is defined as
the summation i = 1 to infinity

00:34:42.671 --> 00:34:50.716
of the Prob (x =
x_i) times

00:34:50.716 --> 00:34:59.809
(x_i -
µ_x)^(2).

00:34:59.809 --> 00:35:05.827
So mu is the mean--we just
defined it of x--that's

00:35:05.827 --> 00:35:11.199
the expectation of x or
also E(x),

00:35:11.199 --> 00:35:15.606
so it's the probability
weighted average of the squared

00:35:15.606 --> 00:35:19.718
deviations from the mean.
If it moves a lot--either way

00:35:19.718 --> 00:35:23.469
from the mean--then this number
squared is a big number.

00:35:23.469 --> 00:35:28.269
The more x moves,
the bigger the variance is.

00:35:28.269 --> 00:35:35.370
There's also another variance
measure, which we use in the

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:41.474
sample--or also Var is used
sometimes--and this is

00:35:41.474 --> 00:35:46.526
∑².
There's also another variance

00:35:46.526 --> 00:35:49.090
measure, which is for the
sample.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:56.935
When we have n
observations it's just the

00:35:56.935 --> 00:36:06.950
summation i = 1 to n of
(x - x bar)²/n.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:18.824
That is the sample variance.
Some people will divide by

00:36:18.824 --> 00:36:24.387
n–1.
I suppose I would accept either

00:36:24.387 --> 00:36:27.869
answer.
I'm just keeping it simple here.

00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:34.400
They divide by n-1 to
make it an unbiased estimator of

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.896
the population variance;
but I'm just going to show it

00:36:38.896 --> 00:36:41.875
in a simple way here.
So you see what it is--it's a

00:36:41.875 --> 00:36:45.010
measure of how much x
deviates from the mean;

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:48.456
but it's squared.
It weights big deviations a lot

00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:51.450
because the square of a big
number is really big.

00:36:51.450 --> 00:37:00.285
So, that's the variance.
So, that completes central

00:37:00.285 --> 00:37:04.829
tendency and dispersion.
We're going to be talking about

00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:08.776
these in finance in regards to
returns because--generally the

00:37:08.776 --> 00:37:11.539
idea here is that we want high
returns.

00:37:11.539 --> 00:37:15.877
We want a high expected value
of returns, but we don't like

00:37:15.877 --> 00:37:18.973
variance.
Expected value is good and

00:37:18.973 --> 00:37:22.210
variance is bad because that's
risk;

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:25.421
that's uncertainty.
That's what this whole theory

00:37:25.421 --> 00:37:30.368
is about: how to get a lot of
expected return without getting

00:37:30.368 --> 00:37:33.884
a lot of risk.
Another concept that's very

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:38.887
basic here is covariance.
Covariance is a measure of how

00:37:38.887 --> 00:37:42.250
much two variables move
together.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:53.479
Covariance is--we'll call
it--now we have two random

00:37:53.479 --> 00:38:06.030
variables, so I'll just talk
about it in a sample term.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:15.523
It's the summation i = 1
to n of [(x –

00:38:15.523 --> 00:38:22.960
x-bar) times (y –
y-bar)]/n.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:28.769
So x is the deviation
for the i-subscript,

00:38:28.769 --> 00:38:34.050
meaning we have a separate
x_i and

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:38.170
y_i for each
observation.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.002
So we're talking about an
experiment when you

00:38:41.002 --> 00:38:44.671
generate--Each experiment
generates both an x and a

00:38:44.671 --> 00:38:48.469
y observation and we know
when x is high,

00:38:48.469 --> 00:38:51.696
y also tends to be high,
or whether it's the other way

00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:54.400
around.
If they tend to move together,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.617
when x is high and
y is high together at the

00:38:58.617 --> 00:39:01.556
same time,
then the covariance will tend

00:39:01.556 --> 00:39:04.966
to be a positive number.
If when x is low,

00:39:04.966 --> 00:39:08.947
y also tends to be low,
then this will be negative

00:39:08.947 --> 00:39:13.000
number and so will this,
so their product is positive.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.260
A positive covariance means
that the two move together.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.715
A negative covariance means
that they tend to move opposite

00:39:21.715 --> 00:39:24.216
each other.
If x is high relative to

00:39:24.216 --> 00:39:27.169
x-bar--this is
positive--then y tends to

00:39:27.169 --> 00:39:30.010
be low relative to its mean
y-bar and this is

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.933
negative.
So the product would be

00:39:31.933 --> 00:39:34.083
negative.
If you get a lot of negative

00:39:34.083 --> 00:39:36.800
products, that makes the
covariance negative.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:41.410
Then I want to move to
correlation.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:51.800
So this is a measure--it's a
scaled covariance.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.980
We tend to use the Greek letter
rho.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.424
If you were to use Excel,
it would be correl or

00:40:01.424 --> 00:40:05.000
sometimes I say corr.
That's the correlation.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:12.760
This number always lies between
-1 and +1.

00:40:19.469 --> 00:40:26.143
It is defined as rho=
[cov(x_iy

00:40:26.143 --> 00:40:32.983
_i)/S_x
S_y]

00:40:32.983 --> 00:40:39.489
That's the correlation
coefficient.

00:40:39.489 --> 00:40:43.540
That has kind of almost entered
the English language in the

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:47.800
sense that you'll see it quoted
occasionally in newspapers.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.509
I don't know how much you're
used to it--Where would you see

00:40:51.509 --> 00:40:53.999
that?
They would say there is a low

00:40:53.999 --> 00:40:58.029
correlation between SAT scores
and grade point averages in

00:40:58.029 --> 00:41:01.210
college, or maybe it's a high
correlation.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:04.579
Does anyone know what it is?
But you could estimate the

00:41:04.579 --> 00:41:09.195
corr--it's probably positive.
I bet it's way below one,

00:41:09.195 --> 00:41:14.469
but it has some correlation,
so maybe it's .3.

00:41:14.469 --> 00:41:19.366
That would mean that people who
have high SAT scores tend to get

00:41:19.366 --> 00:41:22.202
higher grades.
If it were negative--it's very

00:41:22.202 --> 00:41:25.070
unlikely that it's negative--it
couldn't be negative.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:29.076
It couldn't be that people who
have high SAT scores tend to do

00:41:29.076 --> 00:41:32.630
poorly in college.
If you quantify how much they

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.340
relate, then you could look at
the correlation.

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:50.096
I want to move to regression.
This is another concept that is

00:41:50.096 --> 00:41:55.663
very basic to statistics,
but it has particular use in

00:41:55.663 --> 00:42:00.809
finance, so I'll give you a
financial example.

00:42:00.809 --> 00:42:07.755
The concept of regression goes
back to the mathematician Gauss,

00:42:07.755 --> 00:42:14.699
who talked about fitting a line
through a scatter of points.

00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:22.309
Let's draw a line through a
scatter of points here.

00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:31.269
I want to put down on this axis
the return on the stock market

00:42:31.269 --> 00:42:39.494
and on this axis I want to put
the return on one company,

00:42:39.494 --> 00:42:43.020
let's say Microsoft.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:49.989
I'm going to have each
observation as a year.

00:42:49.989 --> 00:42:53.313
I shouldn't put down a name of
a company because I can't

00:42:53.313 --> 00:42:55.670
reproduce this diagram for
Microsoft.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:43:02.494
Let's not say Microsoft,
let's say Shiller,

00:43:02.494 --> 00:43:04.701
Inc.
There's no such company,

00:43:04.701 --> 00:43:06.599
so I can be completely
hypothetical.

00:43:06.599 --> 00:43:11.844
Let's put zero here because
these are not gross returns

00:43:11.844 --> 00:43:16.409
these are returns,
so they're often negative.

00:43:16.409 --> 00:43:20.865
Suppose that in a given
year--and say this is minus five

00:43:20.865 --> 00:43:25.330
and this is plus five,
this is minus five and this is

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:30.120
plus five--Suppose that in the
first year in our sample,

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:36.139
the company Shiller, Inc.
and the market both did 5%.

00:43:36.139 --> 00:43:44.070
That puts a point right there
at five and five.

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:48.900
In another year,
however, the stock market lost

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.210
5% and Shiller,
Inc.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:55.313
lost 7%.
We would have a point,

00:43:55.313 --> 00:43:59.059
say, down here at five and
seven.

00:43:59.059 --> 00:44:02.978
This could be 1979,
this could be 1980,

00:44:02.978 --> 00:44:09.679
and we keep adding points so we
have a whole scatter of points.

00:44:09.679 --> 00:44:14.409
It's probably upward sloping,
right?

00:44:14.409 --> 00:44:19.469
Probably when the overall stock
market does well so does

00:44:19.469 --> 00:44:22.585
Shiller, Inc.
What Gauss did was said,

00:44:22.585 --> 00:44:26.127
let's fit a line through the
point--the scatter of

00:44:26.127 --> 00:44:29.670
points--and that's called the
regression line.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:35.877
He chose the line so that--this
is Gauss--he chose the line to

00:44:35.877 --> 00:44:41.882
minimize the sum of squared
distances of the points from the

00:44:41.882 --> 00:44:44.240
lines.
So these distances are the

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.749
lengths of these line segments.
To get the best fitting line,

00:44:47.749 --> 00:44:50.956
you find the line that
minimizes the sum of squared

00:44:50.956 --> 00:44:53.816
distances.
That's called the regression

00:44:53.816 --> 00:44:57.652
line and the intercept is called
alpha--there's

00:44:57.652 --> 00:45:00.445
alpha.
And the slope is called

00:45:00.445 --> 00:45:04.818
beta.
That may be a familiar enough

00:45:04.818 --> 00:45:10.049
concept to you,
but in the context of finance

00:45:10.049 --> 00:45:15.811
this is a major concept.
The way I've written it,

00:45:15.811 --> 00:45:19.320
the beta of Shiller,
Inc.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:25.511
is the slope of this line.
The alpha is just the

00:45:25.511 --> 00:45:29.200
intercept of this curve.

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:35.409
We can also do this with excess
returns.

00:45:35.409 --> 00:45:38.790
I will get to this later,
where I have the return minus

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:42.609
the interest rate on this axis
and the market return minus the

00:45:42.609 --> 00:45:45.976
interest rate on this axis.
In that case,

00:45:45.976 --> 00:45:50.915
alpha is a measure of
how much Shiller,

00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:53.110
Inc.
outperforms.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:56.223
We'll come back to this,
but beta of the stock is

00:45:56.223 --> 00:45:59.223
a measure of how much it moves
with the market and the

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:02.960
alpha of a stock is how
much it outperforms the market.

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.680
We'll have to come back to
that--these are basic concepts.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:18.166
I want to--another concept--I
guess I've just been implicit in

00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:22.690
what I have--There's a
distribution called the normal

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:27.910
distribution and that is--I'm
sure you've heard of this,

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:33.059
right?
If you have a distribution that

00:46:33.059 --> 00:46:39.478
looks like this--it's
bell-shaped--this is x

00:46:39.478 --> 00:46:46.539
and--I have to make it look
symmetric which I may not be

00:46:46.539 --> 00:46:52.060
able to do that well--this is
f(x),

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:56.783
 the normal distribution.
f(x) = [1/(√

00:46:56.783 --> 00:47:01.979
(2π)σ)]
times e to minus

00:47:01.979 --> 00:47:09.103
[(x-µ)^(2) / 2σ].
It's a famous formula,

00:47:09.103 --> 00:47:14.405
which is due to Gauss again.
We often assume in finance that

00:47:14.405 --> 00:47:16.901
random variables,
such as returns,

00:47:16.901 --> 00:47:21.485
are normally distributed.
This is called the normal

00:47:21.485 --> 00:47:27.302
distribution or the Gaussian
distribution--it's a continuous

00:47:27.302 --> 00:47:29.878
distribution.
I think you've heard of this,

00:47:29.878 --> 00:47:32.238
right?
This is high school raw

00:47:32.238 --> 00:47:35.481
material.
But I want to emphasize that

00:47:35.481 --> 00:47:38.880
there are also other bell-shaped
curves.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.538
This is the most famous
bell-shaped curve,

00:47:41.538 --> 00:47:45.039
but there are other ones with
different mathematics.

00:47:45.039 --> 00:47:49.022
A particular interest in
finance is fat-tailed

00:47:49.022 --> 00:47:50.350
alternatives.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.249
It could be that a random
distribution--I don't have

00:47:59.249 --> 00:48:01.590
colored chalk here I don't
think,

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:05.276
so I will use a dash line to
represent the fat-tailed

00:48:05.276 --> 00:48:08.286
distribution.
Suppose the distribution looks

00:48:08.286 --> 00:48:09.000
like this.

00:48:13.019 --> 00:48:17.651
Then I have to try to do that
on the other side,

00:48:17.651 --> 00:48:22.893
as symmetrically as I can.
These are the tails of the

00:48:22.893 --> 00:48:28.494
distribution;
this is the right tail and this

00:48:28.494 --> 00:48:33.763
is the left tail.
You can see that the dash

00:48:33.763 --> 00:48:38.791
distribution I drew has more out
in the tails,

00:48:38.791 --> 00:48:44.223
so we call it fat-tailed.
This refers to random variables

00:48:44.223 --> 00:48:48.014
that have fat-tailed
distributions--random variables

00:48:48.014 --> 00:48:51.730
that occasionally give you
really big outcomes.

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:55.413
You have a chance of being way
out here with a fat-tailed

00:48:55.413 --> 00:48:58.035
distribution.
It's a very important

00:48:58.035 --> 00:49:02.554
observation in finance that
returns on a lot of speculative

00:49:02.554 --> 00:49:05.670
assets have fat-tailed
distributions.

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:09.751
That means that you can go
through twenty years of a career

00:49:09.751 --> 00:49:13.973
on Wall Street and all you've
observed is observations in the

00:49:13.973 --> 00:49:16.729
central region.
So you feel that you know

00:49:16.729 --> 00:49:19.996
pretty well how things behave;
but then, all of a sudden,

00:49:19.996 --> 00:49:23.683
there's something way out here.
This would be good luck if you

00:49:23.683 --> 00:49:27.474
were long and now suddenly you
got a huge return that you would

00:49:27.474 --> 00:49:30.836
not have thought was possible
since you've never seen it

00:49:30.836 --> 00:49:33.581
before.
But you can also have an

00:49:33.581 --> 00:49:36.868
incredibly bad return.
This complicates finance

00:49:36.868 --> 00:49:39.019
because it means that you never
know.

00:49:39.019 --> 00:49:44.727
You never have enough
experience to get through all

00:49:44.727 --> 00:49:50.087
these things.
It's a big complication in

00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:52.789
finance.
My friend Nassim Talib has just

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:55.205
written a book about it
called--maybe I'll talk about

00:49:55.205 --> 00:49:56.969
that--called The Black
Swan.

00:49:56.969 --> 00:50:02.832
It's about how so many plans in
finance are messed up by rare

00:50:02.832 --> 00:50:07.230
events that suddenly appear out
of nowhere.

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:10.075
He called it The Black
Swan because if you look at

00:50:10.075 --> 00:50:13.860
swans, they're always white.
You've never seen a black swan.

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.535
So, you end up going through
life assuming that there are no

00:50:16.535 --> 00:50:18.132
black swans.
But, in fact,

00:50:18.132 --> 00:50:21.170
there are and you might finally
see one.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:24.126
You don't want to predicate
making complicated gambles under

00:50:24.126 --> 00:50:26.079
the assumption that they don't
exist.

00:50:26.079 --> 00:50:31.083
Talib, who's a Wall Street
professional,

00:50:31.083 --> 00:50:38.140
talks about these black swans
as being the real story of

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.159
finance.
Now.

00:50:40.159 --> 00:50:44.944
I want to move away from
statistics and talk about

00:50:44.944 --> 00:50:49.045
present values,
which is another concept in

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:55.418
finance that is fundamental.
And so, let me--And then this

00:50:55.418 --> 00:51:02.040
will conclude today's lecture.
What is a present value?

00:51:06.789 --> 00:51:09.815
This isn't really statistics
anymore, but it's a concept that

00:51:09.815 --> 00:51:11.630
I want to include in this
lecture.

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:17.907
People in business often have
claims on future money,

00:51:17.907 --> 00:51:21.424
not money today.
For example,

00:51:21.424 --> 00:51:28.261
I may have someone who promises
to pay me $1 in one year or in

00:51:28.261 --> 00:51:34.538
two years or three years.
The present value is what

00:51:34.538 --> 00:51:38.856
that's worth today.
I may have an "IOU" from

00:51:38.856 --> 00:51:43.599
someone or I may own a bond from
someone that promises to pay me

00:51:43.599 --> 00:51:46.309
something in a year or two
years.

00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:50.543
According to a time-honored
tradition in finance,

00:51:50.543 --> 00:51:55.747
it says that it's a promise to
pay $1, but it's not worth $1

00:51:55.747 --> 00:51:59.929
today.
It must be worth less than $1.

00:51:59.929 --> 00:52:06.004
What you could do hundreds of
years ago--and can still do it

00:52:06.004 --> 00:52:11.666
today--was go to a bank and
present this bond or IOU and

00:52:11.666 --> 00:52:15.920
say,
"What will you give me for it?"

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:26.307
The bank will discount it.
Sometimes we say "present

00:52:26.307 --> 00:52:27.650
discounted value."

00:52:31.239 --> 00:52:34.277
The banker will say,
"Well you have $1 a year from

00:52:34.277 --> 00:52:38.119
now, but that's a year from now,
so I won't give you $1 now.

00:52:38.119 --> 00:52:42.039
I'll give you the present
discounted value for it."

00:52:42.039 --> 00:52:45.260
Now, I'm going to abstract from
risk.

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.033
Let's assume that we know that
this thing is going to be paid,

00:52:48.033 --> 00:52:49.579
so it's a matter of simple
time.

00:52:49.579 --> 00:52:53.187
Of course, the banker isn't
going to give you $1 for

00:52:53.187 --> 00:52:57.502
something that is paying $1 in a
year because the banker knows

00:52:57.502 --> 00:53:01.110
that $1 could be invested at the
interest rate.

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:12.308
Let's say the interest rate is
r and that would be a

00:53:12.308 --> 00:53:17.714
number like .05,
which is 5%,

00:53:17.714 --> 00:53:25.630
which is five divided by one
hundred.

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:37.441
Then the present value of
$1--The present PDV or PV of $1

00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:44.996
= $1/(1+r).
That's because the banker is

00:53:44.996 --> 00:53:52.147
thinking, if I have this amount
right now and I invest it for

00:53:52.147 --> 00:53:57.236
one year, then what do I have.
I have (1 +

00:53:57.236 --> 00:54:01.599
r)*(1/1+r).
It's $1, so that works out

00:54:01.599 --> 00:54:04.679
exactly right.
You have to discount something

00:54:04.679 --> 00:54:09.099
that's one period in the future
by dividing it by 1+r.

00:54:09.099 --> 00:54:14.807
This is the present value of $1
in one time period,

00:54:14.807 --> 00:54:20.449
which I'm taking to be a year.
It doesn't have to be a year.

00:54:20.449 --> 00:54:24.972
The interest rate has units of
time, so I have to specify a

00:54:24.972 --> 00:54:29.340
time period over which I'm
measuring an interest rate.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:35.001
Typically it's a year.
If it's a one-year interest

00:54:35.001 --> 00:54:43.575
rate, the time period is one
year, and the present value of

00:54:43.575 --> 00:54:52.741
$1 in one time period is given
by this: the present value of $1

00:54:52.741 --> 00:55:00.280
in n periods is
1/(1+r)^(n) and that's

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:04.420
all there is to this.

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:16.960
I want to talk about valuing
streams of payments.

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:22.316
Suppose someone has a contract
that promises to pay an amount

00:55:22.316 --> 00:55:25.619
each period over a number of
years.

00:55:25.619 --> 00:55:35.534
We have formulas for these
present values and these

00:55:35.534 --> 00:55:42.333
formulas are well known.
I'm just going to go through

00:55:42.333 --> 00:55:47.885
them rather quickly here.
The simplest thing is something

00:55:47.885 --> 00:55:51.910
called a consol or perpetuity.

00:55:57.039 --> 00:56:02.806
A perpetuity is an asset or a
contract that pays a fixed

00:56:02.806 --> 00:56:07.420
amount of money each time
period, forever.

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:11.713
We call them consols because,
in the early 1700s,

00:56:11.713 --> 00:56:16.722
the British Government issued
what they called consols or

00:56:16.722 --> 00:56:22.447
consolidated debt of the British
Crown that paid a certain amount

00:56:22.447 --> 00:56:26.829
of pound sterling every six
months forever.

00:56:26.829 --> 00:56:29.395
You may say,
what audacity for the British

00:56:29.395 --> 00:56:32.400
Government to promise to pay
anything forever.

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:35.339
Will they be around forever?
Well as far as you're

00:56:35.339 --> 00:56:38.469
concerned, it's as good as
forever, right?

00:56:38.469 --> 00:56:41.036
Maybe someday the
British--United

00:56:41.036 --> 00:56:45.687
Kingdom--something will happen
to it, it will fall apart or

00:56:45.687 --> 00:56:48.361
change;
but that is so distant in the

00:56:48.361 --> 00:56:51.760
future that we can disregard
that, so we'll take that as

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.158
forever.
Anyway, the government might

00:56:54.158 --> 00:56:56.735
buy them back too,
so who cares if it isn't

00:56:56.735 --> 00:56:58.857
forever.
Let's just talk about it as

00:56:58.857 --> 00:57:03.334
forever.
Let's say this thing pays one

00:57:03.334 --> 00:57:09.300
pound a period forever.
What is the present value of

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:12.998
that?
Well, the first--each payment

00:57:12.998 --> 00:57:19.579
we'll call a coupon--so it pays
one pound one year from now.

00:57:19.579 --> 00:57:22.119
Let's say it's one year just to
simplify things.

00:57:22.119 --> 00:57:26.729
It pays another pound two years
from now, it pays another pound

00:57:26.729 --> 00:57:30.225
three years from now.
The present value is equal

00:57:30.225 --> 00:57:34.345
to--remember it starts one year
from now under assumption--we

00:57:34.345 --> 00:57:38.260
could do it differently but I'm
assuming one year now.

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:45.320
The present value is
1/(1+r) for the first

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:51.547
year;
plus for the second year it's

00:57:51.547 --> 00:57:58.260
1/(1+r)²;
for the third year it's

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:03.449
1/(1+r)³;
and that goes on forever.

00:58:03.449 --> 00:58:08.023
That's an infinite series and
you know how to sum that,

00:58:08.023 --> 00:58:10.762
I think.
I'll tell you what it is:

00:58:10.762 --> 00:58:13.034
it's 1/r,
or it would be

00:58:13.034 --> 00:58:16.890
£1/r .
Generally, if it pays c

00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:20.176
dollars for every period,
the present value is

00:58:20.176 --> 00:58:24.525
c/r.
That's the formula for the

00:58:24.525 --> 00:58:28.855
present value of a consol.
That's one of the most basic

00:58:28.855 --> 00:58:32.551
formulas in finance.
The interesting thing is that

00:58:32.551 --> 00:58:37.561
it means that the value of
consol moves inversely to the

00:58:37.561 --> 00:58:40.816
interest rate.
The British Government issued

00:58:40.816 --> 00:58:44.523
those consols in the early 1700s
and, while they were refinanced

00:58:44.523 --> 00:58:47.760
in the late nineteenth century,
they're still there.

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:51.842
If you want to go out and buy
one, you can get on your laptop

00:58:51.842 --> 00:58:55.039
right after this lecture and buy
one of them.

00:58:55.039 --> 00:58:58.210
Then you've got something that
will pay you something forever.

00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:02.094
But you're going to know that
the value of that in the market

00:59:02.094 --> 00:59:04.489
moves opposite with interest
rates.

00:59:04.489 --> 00:59:07.480
So, if interest rates go down,
the value goes up;

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:10.210
if interest rates go up,
the value of your investment

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:15.297
goes down.
Another formula is--what if the

00:59:15.297 --> 00:59:23.492
consol doesn't pay--I'm sorry,
the next thing is a growing

00:59:23.492 --> 00:59:24.930
consol.

00:59:28.079 --> 00:59:31.596
I'm calling it a growing consol
even though the British consols

00:59:31.596 --> 00:59:33.815
didn't grow.
Let's say that the British

00:59:33.815 --> 00:59:37.050
Government didn't say that
they'll pay one pound per year,

00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:44.000
but it'll be one pound the
first year, then it will grow at

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:51.550
the rate g and it will
eventually be infinitely large.

00:59:51.550 --> 01:00:02.373
You get one pound the first
year, you get 1+g pounds

01:00:02.373 --> 01:00:09.838
the second year,
etc., (1+g)²

01:00:09.838 --> 01:00:16.900
the third year and so on.
The present value of

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:21.849
this--suppose it pays--let's say
it pays c pounds each

01:00:21.849 --> 01:00:25.480
year, so it would be c
times this.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.403
It would be c times
(1+g)³

01:00:29.403 --> 01:00:33.772
in the third year,
etc., Then the present value is

01:00:33.772 --> 01:00:38.854
equal to c/(r-
g)--that's the formula

01:00:38.854 --> 01:00:42.510
for the value of a growing
console.

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:46.432
g has to be less than
r for this to make sense

01:00:46.432 --> 01:00:50.355
because if g--if it's
growing faster than the rate of

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:53.469
interest,
then this infinite series will

01:00:53.469 --> 01:00:56.920
not converge and the value would
be infinite.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.706
You might ask,
"Well then how does that make

01:00:59.706 --> 01:01:02.665
sense?"
What if the British Government

01:01:02.665 --> 01:01:07.496
promised to pay 10% more each
year, how would the market value

01:01:07.496 --> 01:01:09.995
that?
The formula doesn't have a

01:01:09.995 --> 01:01:12.410
number.
I'll tell you why it doesn't

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:15.106
have a number:
the British Government will

01:01:15.106 --> 01:01:18.722
never promise to pay you 10%
more each year because they

01:01:18.722 --> 01:01:21.225
can't do it.
And, the market wouldn't

01:01:21.225 --> 01:01:24.748
believe them because you can't
grow every year faster than the

01:01:24.748 --> 01:01:27.325
interest rate.
Now that's one of the most

01:01:27.325 --> 01:01:29.290
basic lessons,
you can't do it.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:37.116
One more thing that I think
would be relevant to

01:01:37.116 --> 01:01:39.820
the--there's also the annuity
formula.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:48.398
This is a formula that applies
to--what if an asset pays a

01:01:48.398 --> 01:01:54.870
fixed amount every period and
then stops?

01:01:54.870 --> 01:02:02.301
That's called an annuity.
An annuity pays c

01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:16.824
dollars starting in t =
1,2, 3, and n is the last

01:02:16.824 --> 01:02:25.452
period, then it stops.
A good example of an annuity is

01:02:25.452 --> 01:02:28.871
a mortgage on a house.
When you buy a house,

01:02:28.871 --> 01:02:32.633
you borrow the money and you
pay it back in fixed--it would

01:02:32.633 --> 01:02:36.070
usually be monthly,
but let's say annual payments.

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:40.844
You pay every year a fixed
amount on your house to the

01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:45.979
mortgage originator and then
after so many--n is 30

01:02:45.979 --> 01:02:51.254
years,
typically--you would then have

01:02:51.254 --> 01:02:54.874
paid it off.
It used to be that mortgages

01:02:54.874 --> 01:02:57.829
had what's called a balloon
payment at the end.

01:02:57.829 --> 01:03:00.369
This means that you would have
to pay extra money at the end;

01:03:00.369 --> 01:03:02.980
but they decided that people
have trouble doing that.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:06.079
It's much better to pay a fixed
payment and then you're done.

01:03:06.079 --> 01:03:08.361
Otherwise, if you ask them to
pay more at the end,

01:03:08.361 --> 01:03:10.410
then a lot of people won't have
the money.

01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:16.134
We now have annuity mortgages.
What is the present value of an

01:03:16.134 --> 01:03:22.192
annuity?
That is, the present value of

01:03:22.192 --> 01:03:30.373
an annuity is equal to the
amount--what did I

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:38.554
say--c*{1 –
[1/(1+r)]^(n)

01:03:38.554 --> 01:03:45.040
}/r.
That is the present value of an

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.448
annuity.
I wanted to say one more thing

01:03:48.448 --> 01:03:53.384
because I realize that you have
to--your first problem set will

01:03:53.384 --> 01:03:58.479
cover this--is to talk about the
concept that applies probability

01:03:58.479 --> 01:04:04.560
theory to Economics.
That is expected utility theory.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:09.032
Then I'll conclude with this.
In Economics,

01:04:09.032 --> 01:04:16.619
it is assumed that people have
a utility function,

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:24.981
which represents how happy they
are with an outcome--we

01:04:24.981 --> 01:04:33.677
typically take that as U,
If I have a monetary outcome,

01:04:33.677 --> 01:04:39.510
then I have a certain amount of
money, x dollars.

01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:46.210
How happy I am with x
dollars is called U(x).

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:53.603
This, I think you've gotten from
other economics courses--we have

01:04:53.603 --> 01:04:59.380
something called diminishing
marginal utility.

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:13.931
The idea is that for any amount
of money--if this x is

01:05:13.931 --> 01:05:20.186
the amount of money that I
receive--utility as the function

01:05:20.186 --> 01:05:26.550
of the amount of money I receive
is downwardly-concave.

01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:30.639
The exact shape of the curve is
subject to discussion,

01:05:30.639 --> 01:05:34.960
but the point of diminishing
marginal utility is that,

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.522
as you get more and more money,
the increment in utility for

01:05:39.522 --> 01:05:43.858
each extra dollar diminishes.
Usually we say it never goes

01:05:43.858 --> 01:05:47.389
down, we don't have it going
down, cross that out.

01:05:47.389 --> 01:05:51.000
That would be where having more
money makes you less happy.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.208
That may actually work that
way, but our theory says no,

01:05:54.208 --> 01:05:57.591
you always want more.
It's always upward sloping,

01:05:57.591 --> 01:06:01.448
but it may, after awhile,
you get close to satiation

01:06:01.448 --> 01:06:04.523
where you've got enough.
Incidentally,

01:06:04.523 --> 01:06:08.736
I mentioned this last time--I
was talking about--I was

01:06:08.736 --> 01:06:13.744
philosophizing about wealth and
I asked what are you going to do

01:06:13.744 --> 01:06:17.635
with a billion dollars.
We have many billionaires in

01:06:17.635 --> 01:06:21.084
this country and I think that
the only thing you have to do

01:06:21.084 --> 01:06:24.232
with it is philanthropy.
They have to give it away

01:06:24.232 --> 01:06:26.639
because they are essentially
satiated.

01:06:26.639 --> 01:06:29.087
Because, as I said,
you can only drive one car at a

01:06:29.087 --> 01:06:31.436
time and if you've got ten of
them in the garage,

01:06:31.436 --> 01:06:33.590
then it doesn't really do you
much good.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:36.789
You can't do it;
you can't enjoy all ten of them.

01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:41.019
It's important--that's one
reason why we want policies that

01:06:41.019 --> 01:06:44.301
encourage equality of
incomes--not necessarily

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:46.164
equality,
but reasonable

01:06:46.164 --> 01:06:50.085
equality--because the people
with very low wealth have a very

01:06:50.085 --> 01:06:54.202
high marginal utility of income
and people with very high wealth

01:06:54.202 --> 01:06:57.716
have very little.
So, if you take from the rich

01:06:57.716 --> 01:07:01.010
and give to the poor you make
people happier.

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:05.349
We're not going to do that in a
Robin Hood way;

01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:08.320
but in finance we're going to
do that in a systematic way

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.891
through risk management.
We're going to be taking away

01:07:11.891 --> 01:07:15.745
from lucky--you think of
yourself as randomly on any

01:07:15.745 --> 01:07:18.652
point of this.
You don't want--you know that

01:07:18.652 --> 01:07:21.393
you'd like to take money away
from yourself in the

01:07:21.393 --> 01:07:24.694
high-outcome years and give it
to yourself in the low-income

01:07:24.694 --> 01:07:28.135
years.
What finance theory is based

01:07:28.135 --> 01:07:33.988
on--and much of economics is
based on--the idea that people

01:07:33.988 --> 01:07:39.739
want to maximize the expected
utility of their wealth.

01:07:39.739 --> 01:07:43.874
Since this is a concave
function, it's not just the

01:07:43.874 --> 01:07:47.049
expected value.
To calculate the expected

01:07:47.049 --> 01:07:50.801
utility of your wealth,
you might also have to look at

01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:54.771
the expected return,
or the geometric expected

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:58.050
return, or the standard
deviation.

01:07:58.050 --> 01:07:59.679
Or you might have to look at
the fat tail.

01:07:59.679 --> 01:08:03.188
There are so many different
aspects that we can get into and

01:08:03.188 --> 01:08:06.460
this underlying theory motivates
a lot of what we do.

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:11.906
But it's not a complete theory
until we specify the utility

01:08:11.906 --> 01:08:14.475
function.
Of course, we will also be

01:08:14.475 --> 01:08:17.960
talking about behavioral finance
in this course and we'll,

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:21.624
at times, be saying that the
utility function concept isn't

01:08:21.624 --> 01:08:25.224
always right--the idea that
people are actually maximizing

01:08:25.224 --> 01:08:28.510
expected utility might not be
entirely accurate.

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:31.609
But, in terms of the basic
theory, that's the core concept.

01:08:31.609 --> 01:08:35.830
I have one question on the
problem set that asks you to

01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:40.909
think about how you would handle
a decision: whether to gamble,

01:08:40.909 --> 01:08:45.680
based on efficient--based on
expected utility theory.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:50.270
That's a little bit of a tricky
question but--So,

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:55.913
do the best you can on it and
think--try to think about what

01:08:55.913 --> 01:09:01.460
this kind of theory would imply
for gambling behavior.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:06.299
I will see you on Friday.
That's two days from now in

01:09:06.299 --> 01:09:07.299
this room.

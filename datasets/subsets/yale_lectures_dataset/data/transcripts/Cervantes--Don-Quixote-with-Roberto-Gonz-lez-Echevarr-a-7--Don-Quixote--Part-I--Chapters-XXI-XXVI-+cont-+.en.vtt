00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.981
Prof: We're going to
begin today by going to the end

00:00:06.981 --> 00:00:10.790
of my previous lecture and
taking up,

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.090
again, the topic of
Ginés being cross-eyed,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.270
to give you my final thoughts
on that.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.587
Then we're going to,
as promised,

00:00:22.587 --> 00:00:27.006
move to the character among the
galley slaves that I call 'the

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.333
prisoner of sex',
and finally,

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:38.496
move on to the Sierra Morena,
to the woods and to the

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:45.390
complicated stories that take
place there.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.650
Now, we said that Ginés'
cross-eyedness--

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.250
if such a word exists--is
monocular and convergent--

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.868
monocular meaning of one eye,
one eye goes into the other--

00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:07.209
so this does not allow him to
perceive reality clearly,

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:12.376
but slanted,
by the conflicting angles of

00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:14.959
his visual access.
 

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:18.679
It is a sort of--and this is
the main point of what I'm

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.382
trying to say--
it is a sort of innate or

00:01:21.382 --> 00:01:24.750
congenital,
internal perspectivism,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.120
prior to any perspectivism
based on the multiple points of

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.480
view provided by several
characters.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.436
Perspectivism in Cervantes,
which as I have mentioned

00:01:40.436 --> 00:01:42.890
before,
is a topic of Cervantes's

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.738
criticism,
presuppose the unified visions

00:01:46.738 --> 00:01:52.473
of several characters who view
something like Mambrino's

00:01:52.473 --> 00:01:54.059
helmet,
i.e.

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:58.891
the barber's basin,
and disagree on what that

00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:00.760
happens to be.
 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.363
Each sees reality in a way that
represents his or her point of

00:02:05.363 --> 00:02:08.080
view and his or her way of
being,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.643
but Ginés' being
cross-eyed suggests to me that

00:02:11.643 --> 00:02:15.340
such individual visions are
already an abstraction and a

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.644
hasty assumption,
the assumption that each look

00:02:19.644 --> 00:02:24.318
is singular and represents only
one individual.

00:02:24.318 --> 00:02:29.056
But being cross-eyed means that
within each individual there are

00:02:29.056 --> 00:02:33.926
conflicting views and therefore,
conflicting ways of seeing,

00:02:33.926 --> 00:02:38.567
and this is very much inline
with the way that Cervantes'

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:43.280
characters behave,
at odds with themselves, often.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.833
Now, so the global result is
not a unified but a conflicted

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:54.240
vision within each of the
character,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.449
and I said that this kind of
double vision is called

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.288
diplopia.
 

00:03:01.288 --> 00:03:05.187
It's an awful sounding word of
Greek origin,

00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:06.819
diplopia.
 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:14.038
 
 

00:03:14.038 --> 00:03:20.741
So the new model I propose,
based on this observation that

00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:27.090
Ginés is cross-eyed and
given it importance,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.120
is that it's a new model of
conflictive being,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.720
conflicting being within him or
herself,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.930
capable of seeing
simultaneously in two ways,

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.899
as if there were already an
internal dialogue of sorts

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.900
within each of the characters.
 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.383
This condition Cervantes
represents, as is usual with

00:04:02.383 --> 00:04:06.270
him, in a very funny way.
 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.930
When Ginés,
who was the first--

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.649
who jumped free,
remember--after they took away

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:21.742
the chain: "he leaped free
and is embarrassed [I'm quoting]

00:04:21.742 --> 00:04:25.648
upon the plain,
and setting upon the fallen

00:04:25.648 --> 00:04:28.632
commissary,
he took away his sword and his

00:04:28.632 --> 00:04:30.685
gun,
with which leveling it,

00:04:30.685 --> 00:04:32.661
first at one,
then at another,

00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:36.362
without discharging it,
he cleared the field of all the

00:04:36.362 --> 00:04:38.009
guard." Unquote.
 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.639
Being cross-eyed,
is what I'm suggesting here,

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.237
allows Ginés to guard
each one of the guards at the

00:04:46.237 --> 00:04:49.060
same time or one after another.
 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.656
With one eye,
he's looking at one,

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:53.076
while with the other eye he's
looking at the other,

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:55.690
with a sword in one hand,
with a gun in the other.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.291
And this is,
I think, the way that Cervantes

00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:01.500
is representing this double
vision of Ginés.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.302
If you don't read those lines
carefully you miss that subtle

00:05:07.302 --> 00:05:13.500
point that Ginés can do
that because he is cross-eyed.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.980
So with that,
having said that,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.014
I move on to another prisoner,
who has been generally

00:05:23.014 --> 00:05:29.278
overlooked, and who occupies all
of one paragraph.

00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:35.401
It is the prisoner or the
galley slave that I call 'the

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:40.798
prisoner of sex',
and it shows Cervantes'

00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:48.413
remarkable ability to create a
character with a few brush

00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:49.910
strokes.
 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.093
And I am going to read and
guide you to page 167 where the

00:05:56.093 --> 00:05:58.589
passage is contained.
 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:02.096
He has been asked,
as all the others,

00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:05.310
why he is going to the galleys.
 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.295
And he replies:
"I am going for making a

00:06:10.295 --> 00:06:13.250
little too free with two
she-cousins-german of mine,

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.663
and with two other
cousins-german not mine [This

00:06:16.663 --> 00:06:18.110
is,
of course, eighteenth century

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.964
English,
meaning that he was making it,

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.202
as it were,
with two cousins of his,

00:06:23.202 --> 00:06:25.714
and two other girls,
who were cousins of each of

00:06:25.714 --> 00:06:26.899
other but not of his.
 

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:30.266
I continue]:
in short, I carried the jest so

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:33.824
far with them all,
that the result of it was the

00:06:33.824 --> 00:06:36.399
increasing of kindred so
intricately,

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:39.459
that no casuist can make it out.
 

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:44.009
The whole was proved upon me;
I had neither friends nor money;

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:47.019
my windpipe was in the utmost
danger;

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:49.639
I was sentenced to the galleys
for six years.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.079
I submit--it is the punishment
of my fault;

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:57.166
I am young;
and life may last,

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:59.769
and time brings everything
about: if your worship

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:02.853
señor cavalier,
has anything about you to

00:07:02.853 --> 00:07:06.735
relieve us [actually in the
original it's 'to relieve these

00:07:06.735 --> 00:07:10.016
poor wretches,' he takes
distance from the others]

00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:13.961
God will repay you in heaven,
and we will make it the

00:07:13.961 --> 00:07:16.819
business of our prayers to
beseech him,

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:21.408
that your worship's life and
health may be as long and

00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:27.065
prosperous,
as your goodly presence

00:07:27.065 --> 00:07:30.160
deserves."
 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.778
So he has been sentenced to the
galleys because he was having

00:07:35.778 --> 00:07:39.430
simultaneous affair with four
women,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.050
two of whom were his cousins,
and two others who were not,

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.420
who were cousins to each other.
 

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.632
And had a progeny,
a series of children whose

00:07:48.632 --> 00:07:52.560
family ties were difficult to
untangle.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.262
They were cousins,
brothers and sisters,

00:07:55.262 --> 00:07:58.379
and so forth and so on,
as you can imagine.

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:02.209
Now, the historical reasons
behind this,

00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:06.891
and Cervantes is very careful
in couching all of these stories

00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:09.810
in very precise historical
reasons,

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:17.142
is that men were needed for the
galleys at the time because of

00:08:17.142 --> 00:08:24.327
Spain's overseas adventures,
and so sentences were changed

00:08:24.327 --> 00:08:29.100
to send more prisoners to the
galleys,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.504
and the age limit was
lowered--I think it was to

00:08:34.504 --> 00:08:38.299
sixteen or something like that.
 

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:42.678
So this is the reason behind it.
 

00:08:42.678 --> 00:08:45.552
Now, he is brazen,
and to judge by his being good

00:08:45.552 --> 00:08:49.210
in Latin--
oh, I forgot to read that at

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.889
the end,
where one of the guard's says

00:08:52.889 --> 00:09:00.336
that he's a good Latiner,
that he's good in Latin and so

00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:03.167
forth--
and wearing a robe it shows

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:08.820
that he's a law student,
and this is very significant.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.720
There were many law students at
the time,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.058
and they were masters of
rhetoric and syllogistic

00:09:15.058 --> 00:09:20.336
thinking and arguing,
of course, this being the

00:09:20.336 --> 00:09:25.428
skills that lawyers presumably
develop,

00:09:25.428 --> 00:09:30.168
the kind of syllogism
that--you're too young maybe to

00:09:30.168 --> 00:09:35.453
remember when President Clinton
was being quizzed about his

00:09:35.453 --> 00:09:40.466
relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and he answered one of

00:09:40.466 --> 00:09:44.548
the questions,
"It depends what 'is'

00:09:44.548 --> 00:09:48.126
is," being evasive,
he wanted to have everything

00:09:48.126 --> 00:09:48.580
defined.
 

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.279
He was just using.
 

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:58.653
So the other precise legal
background here is that he has

00:09:58.653 --> 00:10:05.980
engaged in what was called
complex fornication.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.080
There was simple and complex
fornication.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:15.591
Simple fornication was
consensual sex between two

00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:22.509
individuals of different sexes
who are unmarried.

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:24.330
That is simple fornication.
 

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.678
Complex fornication,
you can imagine,

00:10:29.678 --> 00:10:34.279
one of the partners is married,
two of the partners are married

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:37.764
to other people,
they are of the same sex,

00:10:37.764 --> 00:10:41.187
and so forth and so on,
and, of course,

00:10:41.187 --> 00:10:45.679
the sentences for complex
fornication increased--

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:48.830
you see?
 

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:54.453
And here, he has engaged in
complex fornication because he

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:59.585
has committed incest having had
sex with his cousins,

00:10:59.585 --> 00:11:02.940
two of them,
for good measure.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:10.179
But his legal training is
evident here in that he's trying

00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:17.676
to turn what is a criminal case,
incest, to put it in modern

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:21.360
terms, into a civil case.
 

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.070
It's a question of inheritance
law;

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:28.207
how are we going to figure out
the inheritance when these

00:11:28.207 --> 00:11:31.460
children's family ties are so
complicated.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.921
So as you can see,
he has subtly,

00:11:33.921 --> 00:11:38.409
in his discourse,
tried to diminish his

00:11:38.409 --> 00:11:43.849
culpability, but,
of course, he is guilty of

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:49.307
incest and therefore,
has been sent to the maximum

00:11:49.307 --> 00:11:53.740
sentence,
six years in the galleys.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:12:02.009
So he shuffles the question to
a question of inheritance law--

00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:03.558
and you will be hearing a lot
about that today--

00:12:03.558 --> 00:12:08.350
what is a case of incest,
a criminal case.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:13.946
Incest is to make love or to
engage in sex with someone you

00:12:13.946 --> 00:12:17.710
cannot marry according to Canon
law,

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:22.884
Canon law being religious law,
and according to Canon law

00:12:22.884 --> 00:12:26.490
there are all kinds of
prohibitions,

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.460
but cousins you are not
supposed to marry,

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.059
although dispensations can be
obtained from the church and all

00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:33.611
of that--
of course, you cannot marry

00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:35.365
your mother,
you cannot marry your sister,

00:12:35.365 --> 00:12:37.870
and so forth,
but it goes down to your

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.227
cousin, you cannot marry a nun,
all of that is under the

00:12:42.227 --> 00:12:43.980
prohibition of incest.
 

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.433
But certainly here,
he has been guilty of incest

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:51.110
and this is why he is being sent
to the galleys.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.308
You also notice that he says,
'Well,

00:12:53.308 --> 00:12:56.279
this is the proper punishment
for my crime,' as if he knew,

00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:59.100
being already a budding lawyer
and saying,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.923
I accept this,' and he says
that, 'Well, life will go on,

00:13:02.923 --> 00:13:07.090
I'm young, I'll come back from
the galleys,' and so forth,

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.525
which was very unlikely that
he'll come back alive and then

00:13:11.525 --> 00:13:12.750
he disappears.
 

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.837
But not before jumping on Don
Quixote and taking the basin

00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:20.639
from his head and whacking him a
few times with it.

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:26.698
That's the last we hear of this
prisoner of sex who is a kind of

00:13:26.698 --> 00:13:29.200
libertine in the making.
 

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.700
And he and the others disappear
into the woods,

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.700
into the same woods where
Marcela disappeared,

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:42.883
by the way, and into the same
woods into which Don Quixote and

00:13:42.883 --> 00:13:48.558
Sancho are going to go also
running away from the law.

00:13:48.558 --> 00:13:52.240
So notice, again,
what I said at the beginning,

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.727
how Cervantes has created this
rather complex character in just

00:13:57.727 --> 00:14:01.269
one paragraph and by just his
speech,

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:07.190
what he says and how he says it.
 

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:13.312
So now we go into the Sierra
Morena and enter what is really

00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:17.879
the core of Part I of the
Quixote,

00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:21.895
which is made up of all of
these stories that we'll be

00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:26.442
hearing about in the next few
classes and that you're reading

00:14:26.442 --> 00:14:27.048
now.
 

00:14:27.048 --> 00:14:33.418
They are running away from the
Holy Brotherhood,

00:14:33.418 --> 00:14:37.168
about which I've spoken several
times before,

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:40.288
because they are fugitives from
justice,

00:14:40.288 --> 00:14:43.998
and this is the overarching
plot, they are running away from

00:14:43.998 --> 00:14:46.024
justice,
in reality, they are running

00:14:46.024 --> 00:14:48.750
away from justice,
but it's in the real time of

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:49.509
the period.
 

00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:53.543
They are, in fact,
as you will see later when they

00:14:53.543 --> 00:14:56.672
are captured,
being pursued by the Holy

00:14:56.672 --> 00:14:57.990
Brotherhood.
 

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:03.618
They are criminals who,
in some way,

00:15:03.618 --> 00:15:10.048
are expiating their sins in the
woods.

00:15:10.048 --> 00:15:14.519
The woods are a kind of
labyrinth or a vision of hell,

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:20.798
remindful in some aspects of
Dante's Inferno,

00:15:20.798 --> 00:15:23.269
some of its features,
such as the asperity of the

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:25.408
landscape,
the cracks, and so forth.

00:15:25.408 --> 00:15:29.129
They are as far as possible
from civilization.

00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:31.990
It is a world of disorder and
madness;

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:37.922
it is also the
despoblado,

00:15:37.922 --> 00:15:45.707
the unpopulated,
which in Spanish law meant

00:15:45.707 --> 00:15:54.049
areas not covered or protected
by the law, the

00:15:54.049 --> 00:15:58.500
despoblado.
 

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.653
These are areas where the law
and where the power of the

00:16:03.653 --> 00:16:07.120
state, of the crown,
did not reach.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:13.547
Cervantes uses those areas to
send his characters into danger,

00:16:13.547 --> 00:16:17.340
into confusion,
and into violence.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:23.754
Now, the Sierra Morena will be
the setting of a series of

00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:30.168
tightly related episodes all
dealing with the question of

00:16:30.168 --> 00:16:36.470
love and more mundanely with the
issue of marriage.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:44.080
 
 

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.402
Now, the interpolated stories
that come after the Marcela and

00:16:48.402 --> 00:16:52.868
Grisóstomo episode which
prefigured them and Rocinante's

00:16:52.868 --> 00:16:57.304
disastrous flirtation make up,
as I said, the core of the Part

00:16:57.304 --> 00:16:58.850
I of the Quixote.
 

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.058
These stories peak and are
resolved,

00:17:01.058 --> 00:17:03.850
for the most part,
together with the main plot,

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:10.048
the plot involving Don Quixote
and Sancho which,

00:17:10.048 --> 00:17:15.099
as I said, resolves itself when
he is captured and sent back

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:15.700
home.
 

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.662
This is a set of narrative
trends tightly woven around two

00:17:20.662 --> 00:17:23.970
of the principal drives in the
book.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.537
One, Don Quixote's love quest
for Dulcinea and the series of

00:17:28.537 --> 00:17:32.641
crimes and misdemeanors
perpetrated by the hidalgo and

00:17:32.641 --> 00:17:35.960
his squire,
that lead to his pursuit and

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.000
apprehension.
 

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.660
The interpolated stories have
in common with the central plot,

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.170
and with the Marcela and
Grisóstomo interlude,

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:49.663
and with each other the
perpetration of offenses due to

00:17:49.663 --> 00:17:52.660
passion which result in
injuries,

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:57.882
to honor, body and property,
and with the resulting need for

00:17:57.882 --> 00:18:01.362
restitution,
recompense, requital,

00:18:01.362 --> 00:18:03.308
pardon or revenge.
 

00:18:03.308 --> 00:18:06.714
In all of them,
marriage looms as the

00:18:06.714 --> 00:18:11.443
inevitable and most appropriate
form of reparation,

00:18:11.443 --> 00:18:17.118
as well as the most effective
kind of narrative closure.

00:18:17.118 --> 00:18:23.150
Marriage is also in this
context a form of punishment.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:30.013
Now, these stories involve
potentially unequal marriages

00:18:30.013 --> 00:18:36.130
and most of them contain
violence of some sort.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:40.863
Unequal in the sense that the
individuals involved come from

00:18:40.863 --> 00:18:47.240
different social classes,
and that difference is what

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:54.279
motivates many of the conflicts,
but not all.

00:18:54.279 --> 00:18:58.358
But although penal law,
again, looms over the episodes,

00:18:58.358 --> 00:19:02.096
the penal law applied to
criminals like Don Quixote and

00:19:02.096 --> 00:19:06.298
Sancho,
the most developed legal aspect

00:19:06.298 --> 00:19:08.588
in them,
in this stories,

00:19:08.588 --> 00:19:13.540
derives from testamentary law,
something already at issue in

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.170
the Marcela-Grisóstomo
conflict.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.740
Remember how much importance
was given to the fact that they

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.130
had both inherited wealth,
and how they had inherited;

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.865
she being a woman,
he being a man,

00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:28.108
and so forth.
 

00:19:28.108 --> 00:19:33.556
Inheritance and marriage codes
both regulating succession drive

00:19:33.556 --> 00:19:36.279
and constrain the characters.
 

00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:40.720
Restitution and compensation
cooperate to make whole what

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.318
they damage in the process of
channeling their desires--

00:19:45.318 --> 00:19:50.010
if you know something about
law, you know that 'to make you

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:54.865
whole' is to bring restitution
to you for some damage or loss

00:19:54.865 --> 00:19:57.048
that you have incurred.
 

00:19:57.048 --> 00:20:06.150
So the same symbolic topology
reappears,

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.890
that we have seen already
between the road and the inn,

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.769
now, here, it is between the
woods and the inn,

00:20:13.769 --> 00:20:16.278
between the inn and the
wilderness,

00:20:16.278 --> 00:20:20.569
which will be also a good way
to translate despoblado,

00:20:20.569 --> 00:20:23.500
the wilderness.
 

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.098
And the going back and forth
from one to the other is

00:20:26.098 --> 00:20:28.773
punctuated,
often, by interruptions in the

00:20:28.773 --> 00:20:31.417
narratives,
interruptions that we will

00:20:31.417 --> 00:20:33.618
consider carefully later today.
 

00:20:33.618 --> 00:20:37.839
Marriage has to do with the
law, of course,

00:20:37.839 --> 00:20:41.960
as well as with the closure of
stories.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.376
So it is an important
structural issue too,

00:20:46.376 --> 00:20:51.108
structural in terms of
narrative structure.

00:20:51.108 --> 00:20:54.898
Marriage is the ending of many
tales and plays,

00:20:54.898 --> 00:20:59.347
'and they married and lived
happily after' so to speak,

00:20:59.347 --> 00:21:01.490
the end of many tales.
 

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:07.566
That's how things are resolved,
how order is restored,

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:11.118
and succession is in insured.
 

00:21:11.118 --> 00:21:12.538
The questions of love and
marriage,

00:21:12.538 --> 00:21:17.321
which were important issues,
both from a social and literary

00:21:17.321 --> 00:21:20.397
point of view,
surface here as in the episode

00:21:20.397 --> 00:21:22.380
of Grisóstomo and
Marcela,

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.666
I underline,
through stories of young

00:21:25.666 --> 00:21:26.490
people.
 

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.112
The young people,
I have written their names

00:21:29.112 --> 00:21:31.510
here,
and I should get out of the way

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.078
so that we have them clear,
is Cardenio,

00:21:34.078 --> 00:21:36.160
Luscinda, Fernando and Dorotea.
 

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.915
I forget, often,
to say Don Fernando,

00:21:38.915 --> 00:21:43.586
but it says Don Fernando in the
text because he is entitled to

00:21:43.586 --> 00:21:44.660
the 'don.'
 

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:49.502
Now, these are decisive
episodes in which Cervantes is

00:21:49.502 --> 00:21:54.529
dealing with love and marriage
at a significant point in

00:21:54.529 --> 00:22:00.300
western history,
both in social and literary

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.298
terms.
 

00:22:01.298 --> 00:22:05.653
Is love an integral or even
necessary part of marriage,

00:22:05.653 --> 00:22:10.490
or is marriage principally a
social and economic contract?

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:15.150
Do young people have the right
to choose whom they marry?

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.336
All of these questions have
obvious answers today,

00:22:18.336 --> 00:22:20.940
but not then,
and not for a long time.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.717
Even now, well into the
twentieth century in some

00:22:24.717 --> 00:22:27.630
societies, marriages were
arranged.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:33.954
I remember, Gayatri Spivak,
a well-known critic and

00:22:33.954 --> 00:22:37.866
theoretician,
telling me--she's from

00:22:37.866 --> 00:22:43.358
India--that her mother had only
heard her father's voice once,

00:22:43.358 --> 00:22:47.299
in another room,
before the day which she

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:48.680
married him.
 

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.554
The arrangements were being
made and she heard the voice of

00:22:52.554 --> 00:22:56.028
this man who would be her
husband for the rest of her

00:22:56.028 --> 00:22:56.630
life.
 

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:02.449
These are things that are seen
very, very far from our lives

00:23:02.449 --> 00:23:05.308
today, but not at the time.
 

00:23:05.308 --> 00:23:08.733
The issue of marriage was being
debated in the sixteenth

00:23:08.733 --> 00:23:11.597
century,
and it will continue to be

00:23:11.597 --> 00:23:15.792
debated through the centuries,
and it is an important topic in

00:23:15.792 --> 00:23:17.990
Cervantes because it has to do
with social,

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:22.250
legal, and also with the issue
of love.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:28.507
Now, significantly it is now
that Sancho learns to his

00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:33.346
astonishment Dulcinea's real
identity: Ah,

00:23:33.346 --> 00:23:38.660
she is the daughter of Lorenzo
Corchuelo!

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.130
Of course he knows who this
woman is!

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.598
Is that Dulcinea?
 

00:23:44.598 --> 00:23:53.730
The story of Don Quixote's love
for her is the background for

00:23:53.730 --> 00:24:00.372
the stories of Cardenio,
Luscinda, Fernando and Dorotea,

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:05.192
because Don Quixote's love of
Aldonza Lorenzo could have led

00:24:05.192 --> 00:24:09.220
to an unequal marriage,
that of an aristocrat,

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:13.364
even if a minor aristocrat,
with a country lass,

00:24:13.364 --> 00:24:16.328
which is--and unequal
marriages,

00:24:16.328 --> 00:24:19.569
as I've already said,
it's one of the constants in

00:24:19.569 --> 00:24:23.670
all of the stories in the Sierra
Morena and reflect the society

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:32.801
in flux,
where there is insipient class

00:24:32.801 --> 00:24:35.558
mobility.
 

00:24:35.558 --> 00:24:38.269
The sixteenth century Spain was
called by Américo Castro,

00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:42.502
a great historian and critic,
a 'conflictive age,' and part

00:24:42.502 --> 00:24:46.078
of the conflict was this social
effervescence,

00:24:46.078 --> 00:24:50.142
this social instability,
about which I'll speak more in

00:24:50.142 --> 00:24:55.195
the course of the semester--
Aldonza appeals to Don Quixote

00:24:55.195 --> 00:24:59.950
or Alonso Quixano because of her
manly qualities,

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:05.920
which he transforms into
sublime courtly love,

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:11.068
into a sublime courtly love;
beauty.

00:25:11.068 --> 00:25:13.979
She is manly,
in the sense that,

00:25:13.979 --> 00:25:16.795
as we will learn,
she's brawny,

00:25:16.795 --> 00:25:21.019
strong, used to hard labor in
the fields.

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:27.625
I think that this is the
fetishistic appeal she has for

00:25:27.625 --> 00:25:31.555
Don Quixote,
that, as opposed to the women

00:25:31.555 --> 00:25:35.799
in his class,
one supposed--who are civilized

00:25:35.799 --> 00:25:40.876
and so forth--
Aldonza would be more sexual in

00:25:40.876 --> 00:25:44.308
a more physical and open way.
 

00:25:44.308 --> 00:25:50.686
So this is what is,
I think, behind his infatuation

00:25:50.686 --> 00:25:52.088
with her.
 

00:25:52.088 --> 00:26:02.779
What does Don Quixote's love of
Aldonza tell us about love?

00:26:02.779 --> 00:26:06.058
Aldonza/Dulcinea.
 

00:26:06.058 --> 00:26:08.160
This is one of those lessons
for life.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.885
I told you in the first
lecture, you might learn in

00:26:11.885 --> 00:26:15.836
reading the Quixote,
the Quixote is also

00:26:15.836 --> 00:26:17.848
about life, your lives.
 

00:26:17.848 --> 00:26:20.710
What we learn from Don
Quixote's passion for Aldonza,

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:26.361
whom he turns into Dulcinea,
is that when in love we invent

00:26:26.361 --> 00:26:31.617
the object of our desire,
and that that object depends on

00:26:31.617 --> 00:26:34.880
the projection of our own inner
demons.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.558
So this is something to learn
for life.

00:26:38.558 --> 00:26:43.310
I told you, you would learn
quite a few things,

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:48.608
I'll be pointing out others;
but this is perhaps the most

00:26:48.608 --> 00:26:52.930
important and urgent for you to
learn, at least today.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.519
Okay.
 

00:26:54.519 --> 00:26:59.833
Let us set up the cast of main
characters in the stories in the

00:26:59.833 --> 00:27:03.518
Sierra Morena,
so that we can untangle this as

00:27:03.518 --> 00:27:07.185
much as we can,
because it can get complicated,

00:27:07.185 --> 00:27:11.682
and I'm going to also unravel
the socioeconomic background

00:27:11.682 --> 00:27:13.420
behind all of this.
 

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.920
Let us begin with Cardenio.
 

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:22.204
Cardenio, the name suggests,
cárdeno--it means

00:27:22.204 --> 00:27:26.505
purple, bright purple,
it says bright purple with

00:27:26.505 --> 00:27:27.578
passion.
 

00:27:27.578 --> 00:27:33.798
In terms of literary history,
Cardenio is a minor Orlando

00:27:33.798 --> 00:27:37.953
Furioso,
Ariosto's protagonist in the

00:27:37.953 --> 00:27:42.002
poem of that name,
who goes berserk when he

00:27:42.002 --> 00:27:46.970
suspects that Angélica
has betrayed him with Medoro,

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:51.338
a youthful Moor.
 

00:27:51.338 --> 00:27:54.920
This is that famous poem,
Orlando Furioso,

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.288
that I have mentioned several
times,

00:27:56.288 --> 00:27:59.121
and that if you're a literature
major or a literature person you

00:27:59.121 --> 00:28:00.380
should read at some point.
 

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:06.788
Cardenio is mad as a result of
a lover's treason.

00:28:06.788 --> 00:28:11.165
He roams nearly naked,
an image of his savagery,

00:28:11.165 --> 00:28:15.170
of his regression to the world
of nature;

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:19.054
he's a wild man in the
Renaissance tradition--in the

00:28:19.054 --> 00:28:23.318
Renaissance, the figure of the
wild man appears often.

00:28:23.318 --> 00:28:28.294
Madness and love are embodied
in Cardenio as they are in the

00:28:28.294 --> 00:28:32.892
mad knight in Don Quixote,
because Cardenio is also a

00:28:32.892 --> 00:28:36.236
double of Don Quixote,
and, in fact,

00:28:36.236 --> 00:28:41.765
Don Quixote has a feeling of
the uncanny when he meets

00:28:41.765 --> 00:28:45.000
Cardenio for the first time.
 

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.598
He says--I'm quoting from page
183--

00:28:49.598 --> 00:28:51.894
Don Quixote,
quote: "advanced to

00:28:51.894 --> 00:28:54.700
embrace him and held him in a
good space,

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:59.234
very close between his arms as
if he had been acquainted with

00:28:59.234 --> 00:29:00.897
him a long time."
 

00:29:00.897 --> 00:29:01.730
Unquote.
 

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:06.442
Perhaps he had been acquainted
with Cardenio being acquainted

00:29:06.442 --> 00:29:09.428
with himself,
and this is what the line

00:29:09.428 --> 00:29:10.450
suggests.
 

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:16.309
So Don Quixote discovers in
Cardenio like a sort of double.

00:29:16.309 --> 00:29:18.150
Cardenio is a poet.
 

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:27.194
We discover this because of the
little bag they find all rotten

00:29:27.194 --> 00:29:32.424
in the woods--
Don Quixote and Sancho--that

00:29:32.424 --> 00:29:37.390
contains a book of poems and
texts by Cardenio.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:40.682
We have, again,
a literary text read in the

00:29:40.682 --> 00:29:44.211
novel as we did with
Grisóstomo's song,

00:29:44.211 --> 00:29:46.250
remember that episode.
 

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:51.636
Like Grisóstomo,
Cardenio is a Petrarchan or a

00:29:51.636 --> 00:29:56.058
Garcilaso-like poet,
sick with love--Petrarca,

00:29:56.058 --> 00:30:00.923
the great Italian poet,
about whom you have all heard

00:30:00.923 --> 00:30:04.171
is the,
one could say almost the

00:30:04.171 --> 00:30:09.440
creator of modern poetry;
fourteenth century.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.150
And Garcilaso,
whom I have mentioned before,

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.720
I think, but if not I mention
him again,

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:20.441
a disciple of Petrarch,
was the great Spanish poet of

00:30:20.441 --> 00:30:26.644
the sixteenth century who
brought about the whole

00:30:26.644 --> 00:30:33.519
revolution in poetic language,
in the Spanish language.

00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:37.231
Sixteenth century,
Garcilaso lived from about 1501

00:30:37.231 --> 00:30:39.430
to 1536, a very short life.
 

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:43.170
So Don Quixote is very happy to
have found this text,

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:48.029
and very curious about who the
author might be,

00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:52.298
whereas Sancho is very happy to
have found a hundred gold coins.

00:30:52.298 --> 00:30:55.969
And as you may have noticed,
Sancho is not very interested

00:30:55.969 --> 00:30:58.930
in discovering who the owner of
the bag is,

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:03.528
because he doesn't want to have
to return the money.

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:14.690
Now, Cardenio and Luscinda
belong to the low nobility.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:17.425
They are hidalgos,
like Don Quixote,

00:31:17.425 --> 00:31:21.960
with sufficient wealth to make
their marriage desirable.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:26.288
Both would gain,
she would gain social status,

00:31:26.288 --> 00:31:31.963
because Cardenio's status is
higher, and he will gain wealth

00:31:31.963 --> 00:31:35.618
because she is rich,
like Marcela.

00:31:35.618 --> 00:31:40.363
Her estate would become
Cardenio's dowry guaranteeing

00:31:40.363 --> 00:31:44.911
succession,
a reassuring prospect to her

00:31:44.911 --> 00:31:48.196
parents,
because she is a woman and

00:31:48.196 --> 00:31:51.144
there will be,
again--as in the case of

00:31:51.144 --> 00:31:55.050
Marcela--there will be some
concern about the legacy being

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:55.598
lost.
 

00:31:55.598 --> 00:32:00.790
The added capital would even
improve the lineage,

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.088
of course.
 

00:32:02.088 --> 00:32:10.710
Dorotea, on the other hand,
is a commoner.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:16.138
She is the rich farmer's
daughter, and she's far below

00:32:16.138 --> 00:32:21.285
Don Fernando's status,
and marrying her would anger

00:32:21.285 --> 00:32:25.808
Don Fernando's father because
she is his vassal.

00:32:25.808 --> 00:32:31.505
Her name, as you may have
already noticed,

00:32:31.505 --> 00:32:34.700
rhymes with Dulcinea.
 

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.547
We will see other instances
where Cervantes uses rhyme

00:32:39.547 --> 00:32:44.029
echoes of this nature to
establish connections.

00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:48.779
So rhyming with Dulcinea there
is something of a mirroring,

00:32:48.779 --> 00:32:52.076
or echoing effect here,
a version of what Don Quixote's

00:32:52.076 --> 00:32:54.640
and Dulcinea's romance could
have been,

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.845
I told you, the same
relationship,

00:32:57.845 --> 00:33:01.048
except that Don Quixote is old.
 

00:33:01.048 --> 00:33:03.949
The duke, that is,
Fernando's father,

00:33:03.949 --> 00:33:08.701
is so wealthy that while the
increase of the estate would be

00:33:08.701 --> 00:33:12.730
welcome, it would not be much of
an incentive.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:18.490
Now, so much for Cardenio for
now and Luscinda.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:22.452
Now, I move to Fernando,
or Don Fernando,

00:33:22.452 --> 00:33:28.099
who is the most really
complicated of these characters.

00:33:28.099 --> 00:33:31.818
He's not exactly a hero, no.
 

00:33:31.818 --> 00:33:34.931
He is the character most vexed
by judicial and economic

00:33:34.931 --> 00:33:38.958
pressures,
who are the source of most of

00:33:38.958 --> 00:33:43.240
the troubles here,
having seduced Dorotea and

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.348
married Luscinda under false
pretenses.

00:33:46.348 --> 00:33:49.259
He is guilty of estupro,
of rape,

00:33:49.259 --> 00:33:53.115
and the priest,
at some point,

00:33:53.115 --> 00:33:57.876
plans to denounce him,
whereupon he will become a

00:33:57.876 --> 00:34:00.088
fugitive from justice like Don
Quixote.

00:34:00.088 --> 00:34:03.597
Fernando's actions have sent
Cardenio and Dorotea into the

00:34:03.597 --> 00:34:06.430
wilderness,
and left Luscinda in a

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:11.222
dangerous situation,
from which she also wants to

00:34:11.222 --> 00:34:13.965
escape,
but she's abducted by Fernando

00:34:13.965 --> 00:34:16.780
in that story that is told sort
of laterally.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:20.603
And if Cervantes would have
gone into that story we would

00:34:20.603 --> 00:34:23.539
have had an endless sequence of
stories,

00:34:23.539 --> 00:34:28.431
so it's just left hanging,
what happens to her when she's

00:34:28.431 --> 00:34:32.119
abducted from a convent,
and so forth and so on.

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:36.880
Don Fernando is a Don Juan
type, thinking of Don Juan,

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.088
the seducer,
first appeared in western

00:34:40.088 --> 00:34:43.820
literature in a play by Tirso de
Molina,

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.500
a Spanish playwright of the
seventeenth century.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:53.719
Fernando has caused injury to
Cardenio and Dorotea's families,

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:56.420
not just to them individually,
to each one of the young

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.606
people,
by comprising their honor and

00:34:58.606 --> 00:35:01.913
estate,
meaning their social status and

00:35:01.913 --> 00:35:03.619
economic position.
 

00:35:03.619 --> 00:35:08.398
There is an implicit cause,
an implicit,

00:35:08.398 --> 00:35:15.630
subtle, but strong cause for
Fernando's criminal actions.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:21.059
Don Fernando is an anxious
segundón.

00:35:21.059 --> 00:35:26.900
I have the word here.
 

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.523
It comes from the word
'segundo' in Spanish,

00:35:29.523 --> 00:35:30.730
which means 'second'.
 

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:36.690
'Segundón' means
a second-born son.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:43.730
Now, to explain Don Fernando's
socioeconomic status,

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.639
I must expound a little bit on
a Spanish institution,

00:35:47.639 --> 00:35:53.550
the mayorazgo,
which is that word I have here.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:36:02.039
 
 

00:36:02.039 --> 00:36:04.826
In the Middle Ages Castilian
law had elaborated the

00:36:04.826 --> 00:36:07.000
institution of the
mayorazgo,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.115
an entailed state,
a mass of wealth and property

00:36:11.115 --> 00:36:16.282
whose integrity and continuity
was guaranteed by exceptional

00:36:16.282 --> 00:36:18.210
testamentary laws.
 

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:22.356
An entailed state,
in law, is to limit the

00:36:22.356 --> 00:36:28.425
inheritance of property to a
specific line of heirs in such a

00:36:28.425 --> 00:36:33.179
way that it cannot be legally
transferred--

00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:35.552
I'm just giving you the
definition from Webster's

00:36:35.552 --> 00:36:38.320
because not everybody knows what
an entailed state is.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:43.123
As the name implies,
mayorazgo,

00:36:43.123 --> 00:36:47.797
'hijo mayor':
hijo/son,

00:36:47.797 --> 00:36:53.768
mayor/eldest son;
mayorazgo.

00:36:53.768 --> 00:36:56.539
The mayorazgo consisted
in the privileging of first-born

00:36:56.539 --> 00:36:58.059
males in matters of inheritance.
 

00:36:58.059 --> 00:37:02.268
He, the first-born son,
inherited the title and the

00:37:02.268 --> 00:37:04.289
bulk of the endowment.
 

00:37:04.289 --> 00:37:08.679
The mayorazgo was an
entailment devised to ensure the

00:37:08.679 --> 00:37:12.847
accumulation and retention of
wealth within one family by

00:37:12.847 --> 00:37:16.420
preventing its dispersal through
marriages--

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.840
because if you had three sons
and each inherited the same,

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.940
and each married a different
woman,

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:25.635
of course, then the estate
begins to be dispersed and

00:37:25.635 --> 00:37:26.559
diminished.
 

00:37:26.559 --> 00:37:30.918
By the middle of the twelfth
century, the king allowed the

00:37:30.918 --> 00:37:34.590
establishment of
mayorazgos that comprised

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.119
entire villages.
 

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:40.661
A mayorazgo could also
be a royal grant from the king

00:37:40.661 --> 00:37:43.280
as reward for some special deed.
 

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.059
In the Siete
Partidas--this is a word,

00:37:48.059 --> 00:37:49.670
something you better learn,
as I told you,

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:56.074
you were going to learn some
details about Spanish history

00:37:56.074 --> 00:38:05.369
and culture,
essentially seven books.

00:38:05.369 --> 00:38:08.552
The Siete Partidas is a
thirteenth century legal code

00:38:08.552 --> 00:38:10.980
that is the foundation of all
Spanish law--

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:17.052
The legal foundation of the
mayorazgo was ultimately

00:38:17.052 --> 00:38:19.958
grounded--
because how do you ground this,

00:38:19.958 --> 00:38:20.809
I mean on what?
 

00:38:20.809 --> 00:38:26.452
Why the first born?--by making
specific mention of God's

00:38:26.452 --> 00:38:32.197
command to Abraham to sacrifice
Isaac, his first and most

00:38:32.197 --> 00:38:33.840
beloved son.
 

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.170
So the ultimate authority was
the Bible.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:42.900
The Partidas,
Siete Partidas,

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.349
also explicitly allowed the
testator,

00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:49.518
that is, the one whose legacy
is being passed down,

00:38:49.518 --> 00:38:52.931
to forbid his heir from
alienating the inheritance by

00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:56.474
sale or other means,
obliging him to pass it on to

00:38:56.474 --> 00:39:02.460
his own first born son,
and this legislation continued.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:07.686
In the sixteenth century,
commoners were allowed to begin

00:39:07.686 --> 00:39:10.860
mayorazgos,
and so forth.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:15.726
So the proliferation of these
mayorazgos generated a

00:39:15.726 --> 00:39:20.677
class of segundones or
second-born sons who were left

00:39:20.677 --> 00:39:25.289
out of the patrimony--
you see what I mean?

00:39:25.289 --> 00:39:27.610
If only the first born could
inherit,

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.409
and of course,
families had many sons and

00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:33.025
daughters and so forth,
there were a lot of

00:39:33.025 --> 00:39:37.434
segundones--
They had the social status,

00:39:37.434 --> 00:39:41.373
their usually illustrious names
conferred upon them but not

00:39:41.373 --> 00:39:45.313
financial substance or position
in society and an uncertain

00:39:45.313 --> 00:39:46.130
future.
 

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:49.168
Elliott writes in Imperial
Spain, page 114,

00:39:49.168 --> 00:39:52.639
which I think you must have
gotten all ready--I hope:

00:39:52.639 --> 00:39:57.179
"Just under these two
groups of magnates [writes

00:39:57.179 --> 00:40:00.760
Elliott, grandees and
títulos],

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.599
who formed the élite of
the Spanish aristocracy,

00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:07.427
came a group which differed
from them in having no corporate

00:40:07.427 --> 00:40:11.067
entity of its own,
but which none the less enjoyed

00:40:11.067 --> 00:40:14.739
an acknowledged position in the
social hierarchy.

00:40:14.739 --> 00:40:18.797
This group consisted of the
segundones--the younger

00:40:18.797 --> 00:40:20.719
sons of the great houses.
 

00:40:20.719 --> 00:40:22.500
These possessed no title of
their own,

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.300
and were generally victims of
the mayorazgo system

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.199
which reserved the bulk of the
family wealth to their elder

00:40:28.199 --> 00:40:28.849
brothers.
 

00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:31.849
Since their resources tended to
be limited,

00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:35.394
they were likely to devote
themselves in particular to

00:40:35.394 --> 00:40:37.869
careers in the Army or the
Church,

00:40:37.869 --> 00:40:40.228
or to serve the Crown as
diplomats and

00:40:40.228 --> 00:40:41.568
administrators."
 

00:40:41.568 --> 00:40:42.268
Unquote.
 

00:40:42.268 --> 00:40:43.929
The term
segundón,

00:40:43.929 --> 00:40:47.909
by the way, by virtue of its
suffix is an augmentative,

00:40:47.909 --> 00:40:51.780
is derogatory--g
randulón,

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.980
if you know Spanish,
is a lummox;

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.590
regalón,
someone who's spoiled;

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:03.000
coquetón, a flirt;
empollón, a nerd;

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.090
huevón,
lazy bones, and so forth.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:12.219
Some of these are not very nice
words for you to learn in this

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:16.077
class, but it clearly points to
the embarrassing position;

00:41:16.077 --> 00:41:16.889
you see?
 

00:41:16.889 --> 00:41:20.094
I'm trying to give you the
background so you understand

00:41:20.094 --> 00:41:23.289
Fernando's situation--
It clearly points to the

00:41:23.289 --> 00:41:26.460
embarrassing position of someone
who can,

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.715
because of his heritage,
act with the self sufficiency

00:41:29.715 --> 00:41:33.094
of his class,
but has little substance to

00:41:33.094 --> 00:41:34.159
back it up.
 

00:41:34.159 --> 00:41:38.500
The way out of the situation
was contained in a refrain of

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.840
the times, "Iglesia,
mar o casa real."

00:41:42.840 --> 00:42:05.530
 
 

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.858
We will encounter it later in
the captive's tale,

00:42:08.858 --> 00:42:11.840
where it is applied to the sons
of a man.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.056
It meant that the
segundón could go

00:42:15.056 --> 00:42:18.898
into the church,
obtaining a position of some

00:42:18.898 --> 00:42:23.210
importance because of his
family's connection;

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:27.070
'mar,' he could go out
to sea, to seek adventures and

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:29.297
to seek wealth,
go to the colonies,

00:42:29.297 --> 00:42:33.286
and so forth;
or 'casa real,' attach

00:42:33.286 --> 00:42:38.144
himself to the court or to the
court of a grandee,

00:42:38.144 --> 00:42:41.219
of someone who is important.
 

00:42:41.219 --> 00:42:43.420
So cut off from their parents'
legacies,

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:47.630
the segundones became
social and economic climbers,

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:51.780
anxiously trying to make up for
their deficiency in status.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:55.213
In the Spain of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries they

00:42:55.213 --> 00:42:58.815
became a class on to themselves,
a laborious one,

00:42:58.815 --> 00:43:03.219
one should say,
desperately seeking social and

00:43:03.219 --> 00:43:05.570
economic advancement.
 

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:09.007
Don Fernando's situations and
actions betray all of the

00:43:09.007 --> 00:43:10.599
features of this class.
 

00:43:10.599 --> 00:43:13.340
Don Fernando is a
segundón,

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.079
the second son of Duke Ricardo.
 

00:43:16.079 --> 00:43:18.737
In fact, the text reads in
Spanish, "Un hijo

00:43:18.737 --> 00:43:21.500
segundo del duque,"
the duke's second son.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:27.469
It meant all of the sons who
were not the first born;

00:43:27.469 --> 00:43:30.150
it wasn't only the second son,
but also the third,

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:32.286
the fourth, the fifth,
they were all

00:43:32.286 --> 00:43:35.519
segundones,
so the segundón

00:43:35.519 --> 00:43:38.010
is essentially he who is not
first,

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:40.880
the only position with
entitlement.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.190
When Cardenio appears in
Fernando's home remember,

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:47.088
he is summoned by the duke,
explicitly to be the companion

00:43:47.088 --> 00:43:49.996
of his older brother,
who is in line to be the

00:43:49.996 --> 00:43:52.530
father's successor and is all
ready a marquis,

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:56.181
Don Fernando ingratiates
himself with a visitor and wins

00:43:56.181 --> 00:43:57.710
him over to his side.
 

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:01.164
Cardenio is like a rival,
or someone who reminds Don

00:44:01.164 --> 00:44:05.159
Fernando of the role that he
would be called upon to play if

00:44:05.159 --> 00:44:10.179
he chose casa real,
to the join the house of a

00:44:10.179 --> 00:44:11.190
grandee.
 

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.505
He could be a competitor in
that, by becoming the ally of

00:44:14.505 --> 00:44:17.893
his older brother,
he could come closer to wealth

00:44:17.893 --> 00:44:20.610
and power than Don Fernando
himself,

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:24.909
prevented as he is by law from
acquiring them from his father.

00:44:24.909 --> 00:44:29.202
Don Fernando is the odd-man
out, literally number three,

00:44:29.202 --> 00:44:32.559
in this case,
which is worse than second.

00:44:32.559 --> 00:44:36.731
So he lures Cardenio away and
soon finds himself as his rival

00:44:36.731 --> 00:44:38.400
for Luscinda's favors.
 

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.940
His seduction of Dorotea could
have an economic motive too,

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:45.480
when he seduces Dorotea,
even if he leaves her at first.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:49.949
In fact, when he does agree to
marry her later,

00:44:49.949 --> 00:44:53.860
Don Fernando is potentially
founding a state that could,

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.010
conceivably could,
become a mayorazgo of

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:58.349
his own if it is rich enough and
wealthy enough.

00:44:58.349 --> 00:45:03.485
So restitution takes on a whole
new meaning when viewed from

00:45:03.485 --> 00:45:05.139
this perspective.
 

00:45:05.139 --> 00:45:09.599
So readers of Cervantes's time
would have easily and

00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:14.407
immediately recognized all of
the testamentary conflicts

00:45:14.407 --> 00:45:19.478
involved in Don Fernando's
actions and how the law impinges

00:45:19.478 --> 00:45:22.190
on his frantic love life.
 

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:28.360
It is his anxiety that drives
him to this frantic love life.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.277
The economic,
social and ultimately judicial

00:45:31.277 --> 00:45:35.552
context that was the background
of the Marcela-Grisóstomo

00:45:35.552 --> 00:45:38.469
episode is greatly expanded then
here,

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:42.547
to encompass deep social and
economic issues in Castile

00:45:42.547 --> 00:45:44.889
during the sixteenth century.
 

00:45:44.889 --> 00:45:51.289
The judicial situation is
accurate and precise.

00:45:51.289 --> 00:45:54.226
The source of the conflict in
which Don Fernando,

00:45:54.226 --> 00:45:58.079
Cardenio, Luscinda and Dorotea
are entangled is very precise.

00:45:58.079 --> 00:46:01.699
The impending marriage of
Luscinda and Cardenio is one

00:46:01.699 --> 00:46:04.570
that is, again,
dictated, by circumstances,

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:07.030
as well as by mutual
attraction.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:14.110
Cardenio says that Luscinda is
a maiden 'not only well born,

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:16.869
but as rich as I am.'
 

00:46:16.869 --> 00:46:20.233
The description he gives of
their youth and early love is

00:46:20.233 --> 00:46:23.777
like the implicit blue print for
the marriage of Marcela and

00:46:23.777 --> 00:46:28.864
Grisóstomo,
only that it was nearer to

00:46:28.864 --> 00:46:30.860
taking place.
 

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:34.063
Actually, their marriage was
very near to taking place when

00:46:34.063 --> 00:46:35.280
Fernando intervenes.
 

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.045
But the ambition of social
advancement first postponed the

00:46:39.045 --> 00:46:43.418
marriage,
because Cardenio's father feels

00:46:43.418 --> 00:46:49.190
that he should go and answer the
duke's summons,

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:57.059
and then Luscinda's parents are
very interested in her marrying

00:46:57.059 --> 00:47:00.958
Don Fernando,
because it would be a leap in

00:47:00.958 --> 00:47:01.860
social class.
 

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:07.355
So, in fact,
Cardenio accuses Luscinda of

00:47:07.355 --> 00:47:15.186
acting out of economic and
social interest and this is why

00:47:15.186 --> 00:47:19.972
she left him,
and this is the source of his

00:47:19.972 --> 00:47:24.280
feeling of betrayal that has
sent him into the woods.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:29.389
Now, we continue with the cast:
Dorotea.

00:47:29.389 --> 00:47:32.376
Dorotea is the victim of
Fernando's treachery but she's

00:47:32.376 --> 00:47:35.807
not a passive character--
I told you Cervantes's women

00:47:35.807 --> 00:47:38.300
characters tend not to be
passive--

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.913
and her actions are also
dictated by the economic and

00:47:41.913 --> 00:47:45.039
legal determinations that drive
the others.

00:47:45.039 --> 00:47:47.530
She's the daughter of commoners
who are,

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:51.529
however, all Christians,
and the characters boast of

00:47:51.529 --> 00:47:55.920
this at a time when being
suspected of having some Jewish

00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.389
or Moorish blood background
could be a disabling condition

00:48:00.389 --> 00:48:03.922
in the Spain of the time,
so they are very proud,

00:48:03.922 --> 00:48:07.030
old Christians,
wealthy, and so capable of

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:08.840
social advancement.
 

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:13.266
Her father is Clenardo,
the Rich, a great name,

00:48:13.266 --> 00:48:17.695
Clenardo, the Rich,
and he and Dorotea's mother

00:48:17.695 --> 00:48:21.929
have great ambitions for their
daughter.

00:48:21.929 --> 00:48:28.108
In fact, when Dorotea makes up
a story that we'll talk about

00:48:28.108 --> 00:48:34.286
soon when she's disguised as
Princess Micomicona she reveals

00:48:34.286 --> 00:48:40.570
that she is fearful of Fernando
taking away her wealth,

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:44.335
and she--if you remember,
her characterization in

00:48:44.335 --> 00:48:46.518
detail--
she's the one who ran the farm;

00:48:46.518 --> 00:48:51.132
she says she's the one who did
all of the administrative work

00:48:51.132 --> 00:48:52.210
in the farm.
 

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:54.949
So while Dorotea is a woman and
a vassal,

00:48:54.949 --> 00:48:58.039
she is well aware of her rights
and legitimate aspirations,

00:48:58.039 --> 00:49:01.889
not to mention what an asset
her own physical beauty can be--

00:49:01.889 --> 00:49:04.967
we'll be talking about her
physical beauty in the next

00:49:04.967 --> 00:49:07.784
class--
when Don Fernando sneaks into

00:49:07.784 --> 00:49:11.980
her chamber determined to
possess her by any means,

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.119
she makes the decision to
surrender,

00:49:14.119 --> 00:49:18.929
motivated by love,
pragmatism and greed.

00:49:18.929 --> 00:49:24.293
In telling her story to the
priest, the barber and Cardenio,

00:49:24.293 --> 00:49:29.929
Dorotea repeats what she told
herself at that crucial point.

00:49:29.929 --> 00:49:34.534
She's telling the story of what
she thought at the moment that

00:49:34.534 --> 00:49:39.289
Fernando was pressing the issue,
when he snuck into her room.

00:49:39.289 --> 00:49:41.228
She told herself:
"Well: I shall not be the

00:49:41.228 --> 00:49:43.010
first,
who, by the way of marriage,

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.300
has risen from a low to a high
condition,

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.820
nor will Don Fernando be the
first,

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:50.010
whom beauty,
or rather blind affection,

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:53.150
has induced to take a wife
beneath his quality.

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:56.449
Since then I neither make a new
world,

00:49:56.449 --> 00:49:59.557
nor a new custom,
sure I may be allowed to accept

00:49:59.557 --> 00:50:02.474
this honour,
which fortune throws in my way,

00:50:02.474 --> 00:50:06.052
even though the inclination he
shows for me should last no

00:50:06.052 --> 00:50:08.940
longer than the accomplishment
of his will;

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.213
for in short,
in the sight of God,

00:50:11.213 --> 00:50:12.730
I shall be his wife.
 

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:15.690
Besides, should I reject him
with disdain,

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:19.559
I see him prepared to set aside
all sense of duty,

00:50:19.559 --> 00:50:22.179
and to have recourse to
violence: and so I shall remain

00:50:22.179 --> 00:50:24.023
dishonored,
and without excuse,

00:50:24.023 --> 00:50:27.768
when I am censured by those,
who do not know how innocently

00:50:27.768 --> 00:50:29.360
I came into this strait.
 

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.309
For what reasons can be
sufficient to persuade my

00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:35.382
parents, and others,
that this cavalier got into my

00:50:35.382 --> 00:50:37.780
apartment without my
consent?"

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:43.644
So she draws a balance and
decides that the best thing is

00:50:43.644 --> 00:50:45.739
simply to consent.
 

00:50:45.739 --> 00:50:49.795
Of course, she has made him
swear that they are going to

00:50:49.795 --> 00:50:53.478
marry,
and she has made him swear in

00:50:53.478 --> 00:50:57.159
front of her maid,
who was the one who let him in,

00:50:57.159 --> 00:50:59.789
that he would marry and in the
Spain of the time--

00:50:59.789 --> 00:51:03.760
I will talk about this much
more--secret marriages were

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.369
allowed,
meaning, if you told your

00:51:06.369 --> 00:51:10.690
beloved in the darkness of night
in a fit of passion that you

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:13.746
wanted to marry her,
and she said yes,

00:51:13.746 --> 00:51:17.864
you were, you were married,
because God is everywhere and

00:51:17.864 --> 00:51:20.532
God is listening,
so therefore,

00:51:20.532 --> 00:51:23.659
presumably you are married.
 

00:51:23.659 --> 00:51:31.813
Of course, the temptation not
to abide by this marriage vows

00:51:31.813 --> 00:51:35.574
was great,
and the debates about it in the

00:51:35.574 --> 00:51:38.887
Council of Trent,
as we will have reason to

00:51:38.887 --> 00:51:43.693
discuss in classes concerning
other marriage situations in

00:51:43.693 --> 00:51:45.550
Part II were great.
 

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:48.697
So Dorotea is faithfully,
following both religious

00:51:48.697 --> 00:51:52.422
doctrine and Castilian law which
condoned premarital sexual

00:51:52.422 --> 00:51:56.501
relationships after a betrothal,
such as the one she has forced

00:51:56.501 --> 00:51:57.750
Don Fernando to make.
 

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.536
He has sworn to marry her not
only before God,

00:52:00.536 --> 00:52:02.829
but before herself and her
servant.

00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:05.099
When she pleads her case at the
inn,

00:52:05.099 --> 00:52:07.711
Dorotea invokes this oath,
appeals to Don Fernando's

00:52:07.711 --> 00:52:09.655
conscience,
and assures him that,

00:52:09.655 --> 00:52:12.869
by law, he's not compromising
his or his family's status

00:52:12.869 --> 00:52:15.789
because nobility is transmitted
by the father,

00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:19.114
not the mother's blood in
Castile--as we had occasion to

00:52:19.114 --> 00:52:22.199
see in the case of
Grisóstomo and Marcela.

00:52:22.199 --> 00:52:26.947
She convinces Don Fernando with
a speech that has as much verve

00:52:26.947 --> 00:52:30.318
as Marcela's,
and is also couched in forensic

00:52:30.318 --> 00:52:32.539
rhetoric and terminology.
 

00:52:32.539 --> 00:52:39.996
So this is what is behind the
legal, socioeconomic background

00:52:39.996 --> 00:52:46.210
of these stories,
about which we will talk more.

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:51.103
But I'm now going to speak
briefly, and in conclusion,

00:52:51.103 --> 00:52:55.719
about one important aspect that
I mentioned before,

00:52:55.719 --> 00:52:58.489
and that is interruptions.
 

00:52:58.489 --> 00:53:02.322
You will have noticed that all
of these stories,

00:53:02.322 --> 00:53:07.300
or that many of the stories,
are interrupted at some point.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.150
The whole novel is interrupted.
 

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:12.980
In chapter VIII,
when the narrator claims to

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:16.788
have run out of text--
so that is perhaps the most

00:53:16.788 --> 00:53:20.420
famous interruption in western
literature--

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.989
but there have been many other
interruptions;

00:53:23.989 --> 00:53:27.097
the story of Marcela and
Grisóstomo being told by

00:53:27.097 --> 00:53:28.385
Vivaldo,
and Ambrosio,

00:53:28.385 --> 00:53:30.590
and others, is interrupted
several times,

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:38.489
but the most--and also we have
the proleptic interruption--

00:53:38.489 --> 00:53:43.083
very funny interruption of
Sancho telling his story about

00:53:43.083 --> 00:53:47.923
Torralba and her boyfriend and
the goats having to cross the

00:53:47.923 --> 00:53:51.268
river and all of that--
remember that interruption?

00:53:51.268 --> 00:53:54.889
But here, we have other
interruptions.

00:53:54.889 --> 00:54:01.099
The most important and the most
spectacular is that of Cardenio.

00:54:01.099 --> 00:54:03.297
Cardenio says,
and I won't read you the text

00:54:03.297 --> 00:54:06.059
because you have it there and
you must remember it,

00:54:06.059 --> 00:54:09.829
that he will tell the story,
but he will not be interrupted;

00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:14.177
he does not want to be
interrupted with questions or

00:54:14.177 --> 00:54:19.376
anything, so that that is the
precondition for his telling the

00:54:19.376 --> 00:54:20.230
story.
 

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:22.592
But, of course,
at some point he mentions

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:28.902
Amadís de Gaula,
and that is simply too much for

00:54:28.902 --> 00:54:34.469
Don Quixote to resist,
and he breaks in,

00:54:34.469 --> 00:54:40.260
and interrupts Cardenio,
and Cardenio goes berserk.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:43.771
He goes berserk,
and he brings up this story

00:54:43.771 --> 00:54:49.159
about Queen Madasima having had
an affair with a lowly surgeon--

00:54:49.159 --> 00:54:52.010
surgeons at the time did not
have a very high status--

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:55.219
and, of course,
attacks Don Quixote and Sancho,

00:54:55.219 --> 00:55:00.280
and runs wild.
 

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.451
What is behind all of these
interruptions and there are

00:55:03.451 --> 00:55:03.980
others?
 

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:09.219
What is behind all of these
interruptions is that they allow

00:55:09.219 --> 00:55:14.355
for a certain truth to come out,
because what Cervantes is

00:55:14.355 --> 00:55:19.460
showing that stories have a sort
of a self generating thrust,

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:26.025
that they follow a certain
script, and that they veil the

00:55:26.025 --> 00:55:32.518
truth instead of telling it,
and that unless the teller is

00:55:32.518 --> 00:55:37.150
interrupted,
the truth does not come out.

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:40.369
So what is the truth here?
 

00:55:40.369 --> 00:55:42.809
The truth here,
in the case of Cardenio,

00:55:42.809 --> 00:55:47.931
is that he has this paranoid
fantasy that Fernando has

00:55:47.931 --> 00:55:52.376
already possessed Luscinda,
and that therefore,

00:55:52.376 --> 00:55:55.880
Luscinda is not fit for
marriage with him.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.940
It is unclear whether this
happened,

00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:01.190
but the story that Cardenio
tells, translated into

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:03.855
literature,
is that this Queen Madasima had

00:56:03.855 --> 00:56:05.590
this affair with this surgeon.
 

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:10.123
The idea of the surgeon,
of cutting, is obviously a

00:56:10.123 --> 00:56:14.202
story of deflowering that is
deep in his mind,

00:56:14.202 --> 00:56:19.099
and that Luscinda has been
deflowered by Fernando.

00:56:19.099 --> 00:56:25.306
So he has transformed that
story in his fantasy into that

00:56:25.306 --> 00:56:30.626
paranoid fantasy,
that what it reveals truly what

00:56:30.626 --> 00:56:33.619
is in his subconscious.
 

00:56:33.619 --> 00:56:38.161
This is similar to what we had
in the case of Don Quixote

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:41.000
making up that chivalric
romance;

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.509
that in telling the story,
in this case,

00:56:43.509 --> 00:56:46.789
interrupting the story,
it reveals another story.

00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:53.235
What the Quixote,
as a book, shows us is how to

00:56:53.235 --> 00:56:55.059
read stories.
 

00:56:55.059 --> 00:56:58.579
It is a primer on how to read
stories.

00:56:58.579 --> 00:57:03.489
This is the second lesson for
life that you learn here even,

00:57:03.489 --> 00:57:07.650
or particularly,
if you're going to be a lawyer.

00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:09.630
Why?
 

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:14.646
Lawyers do not allow witnesses
to go on speaking for a long

00:57:14.646 --> 00:57:17.489
time,
they're taught to interrupt

00:57:17.489 --> 00:57:22.510
them, because a witness can go
on and let the story get away,

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:26.809
and create facts that don't
exist, and so forth--

00:57:26.809 --> 00:57:29.824
The story that I always tell
when I get to this point is one

00:57:29.824 --> 00:57:33.032
that happened many years ago,
and that you are too young to

00:57:33.032 --> 00:57:35.702
remember,
but it's the story of Susan

00:57:35.702 --> 00:57:36.239
Smith.
 

00:57:36.239 --> 00:57:37.789
You may not have heard of Susan
Smith.

00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:41.599
She lived in a town in South
Carolina.

00:57:41.599 --> 00:57:45.382
She had two children,
and she claimed that she had

00:57:45.382 --> 00:57:49.010
been stopped at a traffic light
in her town,

00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:54.079
and a black man had gotten into
her car,

00:57:54.079 --> 00:57:59.300
and pushed her out,
and run away with her children,

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:04.230
and she came on TV tearfully
for almost a week.

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:09.351
There was a whole manhunt all
over the United States to try to

00:58:09.351 --> 00:58:13.130
capture this abductor of the two
children,

00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:18.139
who of course,
claiming that he was black,

00:58:18.139 --> 00:58:21.250
added a racist component to
this whole thing,

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:26.583
until a certain sheriff broke
into her story and asked her

00:58:26.583 --> 00:58:29.634
questions,
and it turned out that Susan

00:58:29.634 --> 00:58:33.630
Smith had driven her car with
her two children into a lake,

00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:35.760
and gotten out,
and killed the children and

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.550
just made the car disappear
because she had a lover,

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:42.630
a 'Fernando' of this South
Carolina town,

00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:45.840
who was wealthy and a man about
town,

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.746
debonair, but didn't want to
marry a woman who had two

00:58:48.746 --> 00:58:50.909
children;
Susan Smith was divorced.

00:58:50.909 --> 00:58:54.449
So this came out,
when she was interrupted,

00:58:54.449 --> 00:58:56.755
after having been on TV
tearfully telling the whole

00:58:56.755 --> 00:59:00.322
story--
so if you interrupt a story

00:59:00.322 --> 00:59:03.844
being told,
a story gathering momentum from

00:59:03.844 --> 00:59:07.913
within itself,
you may get the real story to

00:59:07.913 --> 00:59:08.750
emerge.
 

00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:13.391
And this is what's happening in
the interruption of all of these

00:59:13.391 --> 00:59:17.960
stories, which happens over and
again in the Quixote.

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:23.155
So what is most important to
remember from these interrupted

00:59:23.155 --> 00:59:27.469
tales is to look for the story
not being told,

00:59:27.469 --> 00:59:32.670
or for the story being told
obliquely,

00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:37.123
as we did when considering Don
Quixote's invention of the

00:59:37.123 --> 00:59:41.760
generic chivalric romance,
which was a roundabout way of

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:46.585
speaking about his own anxieties
and about his lack of social

00:59:46.585 --> 00:59:47.389
status.
 

00:59:47.389 --> 00:59:50.228
This is why in the
psychoanalytic session,

00:59:50.228 --> 00:59:53.898
the analyst will interrupt you,
and ask you questions,

00:59:53.898 --> 00:59:56.530
'Oh, what did you say about
mommy?

00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:58.090
Hmm...
 

00:59:58.090 --> 00:59:59.860
What did you say about daddy?
 

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:01.260
Hmm...'
 

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.480
And doesn't let you go on.
 

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.150
It's in that give and take that
the truth may emerge.

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:11.650
So this is what this book is
telling us.

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:14.409
We will see this narrative
device appear,

01:00:14.409 --> 01:00:16.773
again, when Dorotea,
disguised as Princess

01:00:16.773 --> 01:00:20.059
Micomicona,
makes up a story that is really

01:00:20.059 --> 01:00:24.300
that of her own turbulent love
affair with Fernando.

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.954
She cannot make up a fictional
story without this emerging in

01:00:27.954 --> 01:00:30.574
the background,
and there are little details

01:00:30.574 --> 01:00:32.889
that betray that that's the
story.

01:00:32.889 --> 01:00:36.900
So the Quixote is among
many other things:

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:41.844
a book about how to read,
how to interpret stories,

01:00:41.844 --> 01:00:47.679
and in life we are surrounded
by stories of all kinds,

01:00:47.679 --> 01:00:50.519
not just in literature.
 

01:00:50.519 --> 01:00:56.000

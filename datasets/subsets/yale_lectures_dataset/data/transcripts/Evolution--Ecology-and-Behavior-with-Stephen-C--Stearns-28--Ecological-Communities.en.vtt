00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.896
Prof: Okay,
today we're going to start

00:00:03.896 --> 00:00:06.340
talking about ecological
communities;

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:13.090
and this builds on our prior
discussion of competition,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.090
predation and disease.
 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.560
So I'm first going to give you
the classic view;

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.024
by classic, I mean the view of
community ecology from about

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.410
forty years ago.
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.351
Then I'm going to talk about
something that has become a very

00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:33.030
dominant and influential point
of view more recently,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.830
which is top-down control and
trophic cascades.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.680
Then I'm going to emphasize the
importance of history.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.354
So communities are not some
kind of isolated microcosm,

00:00:45.354 --> 00:00:49.028
they develop in the real world
and they have a history,

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:50.730
and that's important.
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.900
And they also exist in space.
 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.378
So next time,
actually, we're going to talk a

00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:59.778
bit about geography,
island biogeography and

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:01.359
metapopulations.
 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.099
This is making kind of a jump
ahead into that.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.972
Dispersal really does make a
big difference to the structure

00:01:07.972 --> 00:01:10.962
of communities;
and I'll mention that briefly

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:12.060
in this lecture.
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.330
And the take-home message
really is that communities,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.948
which consist of basically all
of the species that you find in

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:25.979
a local habitat,
and how they interact with each

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.869
other,
have been shown to be shaped by

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.629
all of these things:
competition,

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:31.590
predation, parasites and
pathogens;

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.010
so in a real system they all
interact.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.396
And it is one of the aims of
community ecologists,

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:41.474
out of this complexity to pull
a few take-home messages that

00:01:41.474 --> 00:01:43.340
they can apply broadly.
 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.489
So we'll be discussing some of
those today.

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:48.706
So the classical view on
competition-driven species

00:01:48.706 --> 00:01:51.665
packing, on the planet,
was developed by Evelyn

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:52.629
Hutchinson.
 

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:57.039
And the key reference is from
just fifty years ago,

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.390
"Homage to Santa
Rosalia."

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.551
Santa Rosalia was a saint who
had a church named in her honor

00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:09.223
in Sicily,
and Hutchinson visited this

00:02:09.223 --> 00:02:14.162
church on vacation,
and in a pool in the church he

00:02:14.162 --> 00:02:16.818
observed two aquatic bugs.
 

00:02:16.818 --> 00:02:20.328
And one of them was large and
one of them was small,

00:02:20.328 --> 00:02:24.113
but otherwise they looked the
same and they ate the same

00:02:24.113 --> 00:02:24.870
things.
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.961
And so that led him--it's an
amazing generalization,

00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:31.060
isn't it?
 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.200
You're kind of wandering
through the churchyard and you

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.620
see a pool and it's got two
species of aquatic bugs in it--

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.197
and immediately Hutchinson's
mind jumps out to the whole

00:02:40.197 --> 00:02:42.895
planet,
and wonders why are there so

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:45.830
many different kinds of plants
and animals?

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.718
And his answer is because
evolution has packed them

00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:50.800
tightly into the available
niches.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.958
And if it has done so,
then there should be a limit to

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.940
the similarity of competing
species;

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.610
which is what he had seen.
 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.366
He'd seen these two species
living in this pool,

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:04.360
and they're not the same size,
they're different.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.967
And he's wondering what is the
evolutionary process which has

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:08.620
caused them to have different
sizes?

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.430
And he thinks it's competition.
 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.461
And so he measured them,
and then he went back and did a

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:18.639
literature review and came up
with the claim that the body

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.110
size of the smaller one seems to
stabilize at about 75%,

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.439
as a length measurement of the
body size of the larger one.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.720
And he goes into this.
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.008
This is from the paper.
 

00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:36.660
And you can see here that the
kinds of things he's looking at

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.416
are mustelids;
so these are weasels,

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:45.449
and this is a mouse,
and then these are two

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:51.081
nuthatches in Iran,
and then these are Galapagos

00:03:51.081 --> 00:03:52.639
finches.
 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.972
And from that he gets a
measurement when allopatric and

00:03:56.972 --> 00:04:01.526
a measurement when sympatric;
and basically the summary of

00:04:01.526 --> 00:04:05.806
all of this is that species
differ more when they're living

00:04:05.806 --> 00:04:08.979
together than when they're
living apart.

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.403
It's as though when they are
living together,

00:04:11.403 --> 00:04:14.270
they're being pushed by
something to be different.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.090
Okay?
 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.656
And that was taken as an
estimate of limiting similarity

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:22.680
under competition.
 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.889
So that's a classical view.
 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.769
And you've seen previously some
of the data;

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:31.396
you've read about some of the
data that indicate that

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:32.759
competition is important.
 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.230
A lot of that is field
manipulation experiments.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.269
So that's one idea:
The world is the way it is

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:40.769
because it's shaped by
competition.

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:44.529
The second idea is this idea of
top-down control.

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.110
By top-down,
basically the top is the top of

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.750
the food chain,
and down is the bottom of the

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.649
food chain.
 

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:55.970
So this is about predators
eating things in a food chain.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.139
And in particular it can
interact with competition.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:08.079
So one of the early ideas was
that if a top predator prefers

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:13.610
to eat prey that are
competitively superior,

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.422
then predation enables the
competitively inferior species

00:05:18.422 --> 00:05:19.540
to survive.
 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.480
So what would happen is if you
pulled out the predator,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.000
so there was no top level in
the food chain,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.728
and you just had say the
herbivores competing with each

00:05:30.728 --> 00:05:33.151
other--
the things that would be eating

00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:35.709
algae or plants competing with
each other--

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:39.805
then you would find that the
dominant competitor would

00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:43.740
exclude the inferior competitor,
which would go extinct,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.879
and you would have a simpler
community.

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.545
So in this sense predation is
maintaining biodiversity in the

00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:52.204
community,
and it's making possible for

00:05:52.204 --> 00:05:56.204
the inferior competitors to do
well because they're better at

00:05:56.204 --> 00:05:57.870
escaping the predator.
 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.879
So the key papers on this are
Brooks and Dodson;

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.168
a 1965 paper that was done
here, by two people in this

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:08.220
department.
 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.644
Stan Dodson was a sophomore
when he helped John Brooks do

00:06:11.644 --> 00:06:12.439
this paper.
 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.488
And they did it on data on
daphnia and other zooplankton,

00:06:16.488 --> 00:06:19.742
living in reservoirs and lakes
in Connecticut,

00:06:19.742 --> 00:06:23.310
in which there were alewives;
fish that came in,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.396
or were landlocked,
that would be eating some of

00:06:26.396 --> 00:06:30.334
the--you'll see the picture in a
minute--that were eating the

00:06:30.334 --> 00:06:31.449
zooplankton.
 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.209
And the other classical paper
is from Bob Payne.

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:38.490
That came out thirty-three
years ago.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.879
And what Bob did was work,
like Joe Connell,

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.930
in the rocky intertidal.
 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.225
Bob worked off the--he worked
on Tatoosh Island,

00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:50.449
on the northwest coast of the
United States;

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:51.959
it's on the Olympic Peninsula.
 

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:56.569
And there he could remove
starfish from the intertidal,

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:01.009
and he did so sort of in blocks
in the intertidal.

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:03.586
And he could go out frequently
enough so that he could really

00:07:03.586 --> 00:07:06.370
keep the starfish off,
and then he looked at how the

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.440
community reorganized itself
when he removed this top

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.149
predator.
 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:21.113
Now energy is flowing up
through trophic levels in the

00:07:21.113 --> 00:07:23.050
food chain.
 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.699
And when we talk about top-down
control,

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:32.600
basically we are talking about
how the secondary carnivores,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.315
or the primary carnivores--well
the secondary carnivores are

00:07:36.315 --> 00:07:39.288
eating the herbivores,
and the herbivores are

00:07:39.288 --> 00:07:41.519
eating--excuse me,
the primary carnivores are

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:44.779
eating the herbivores;
the herbivores are eating the

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:48.019
plants that are trapping solar
energy.

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:50.670
And when we talk about top-down
control,

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.757
we're basically talking about
either the secondary or the

00:07:53.757 --> 00:07:57.266
primary carnivores,
usually controlling what's

00:07:57.266 --> 00:08:00.800
going on below them in the food
chain,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.112
going up this way,
and the omnivores and the

00:08:03.112 --> 00:08:05.639
detritivores are usually off in
another loop.

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:10.160
So the food chain idea,
that you go up through a simple

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.838
linear chain,
is actually quite a

00:08:12.838 --> 00:08:14.430
simplification.
 

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.963
If you look at a food web,
then things get a little bit

00:08:19.963 --> 00:08:21.910
more complicated.
 

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:27.295
This is a food web that you
might find on the north slope of

00:08:27.295 --> 00:08:31.374
Alaska,
and it contains birds,

00:08:31.374 --> 00:08:36.493
marine animals,
foxes, things living in the

00:08:36.493 --> 00:08:38.769
soil, decaying matter.
 

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:44.501
And you can see that there are
potential flows of matter and

00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:50.038
energy in quite a different
number of different directions

00:08:50.038 --> 00:08:52.080
in this food web.
 

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.970
So when we simplify that
picture and say there's top-down

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.860
control, I just wanted to have
that in the background.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.038
I don't have a food web for
this particular pond here.

00:09:05.038 --> 00:09:08.081
This is Lindsley Pond and other
such ponds and lakes in

00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:08.870
Connecticut.
 

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:14.792
But in Lindsley Pond,
what Brooks and Dodson showed

00:09:14.792 --> 00:09:20.927
is that if you have an alewife--
I'm going to just go out of

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:27.547
this for a second,
go up here, and go back in--if

00:09:27.547 --> 00:09:36.424
you have an alewife in the lake,
and you have an array of

00:09:36.424 --> 00:09:40.769
zooplankton,
of different size, okay?

00:09:40.769 --> 00:09:44.428
This--that is--there we go.
 

00:09:44.428 --> 00:09:48.693
This is the size distribution
of things in the lake,

00:09:48.693 --> 00:09:51.120
when there are no alewives.
 

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.349
You put an alewife into the
lake and you shift the size

00:09:54.349 --> 00:09:57.399
distribution down to the smaller
size categories.

00:09:57.399 --> 00:10:01.000
So the idea behind this is that
when there are no alewives,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.230
the bigger guys are
out-competing the little guys.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.893
You put the alewife in to eat
the big guys,

00:10:06.893 --> 00:10:09.428
and it gives the little guys a
chance.

00:10:09.428 --> 00:10:13.634
And basically the ones that are
taken out are Daphnia and this

00:10:13.634 --> 00:10:16.668
Mesocyclops;
which is a copepod.

00:10:16.668 --> 00:10:21.754
And the ones then which are
allowed to increase in frequency

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:25.028
are little things like
Ceriodaphnia;

00:10:25.028 --> 00:10:27.798
that's plankton,
which is a rotifer;

00:10:27.798 --> 00:10:32.125
Bosmina, which is another
cladoceran, a relative of

00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:34.246
Daphnia;
and Tropocyclops,

00:10:34.246 --> 00:10:36.168
which is a small copepod.
 

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:40.841
So simply by putting this fish
into, or taking it out of a

00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:44.860
lake, you completely restructure
the community.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:49.691
And remember that big things
take longer to mature,

00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:53.460
and small things mature more
rapidly.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.693
So what's going on here is not
just a shift in the size

00:10:56.693 --> 00:10:59.870
distribution of the species that
live in the lake,

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.515
it's a reorganization of the
whole population dynamics and

00:11:03.515 --> 00:11:07.100
rate of energy transfer of
things in the lake as well.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.433
And as a Ph.D.
 

00:11:08.433 --> 00:11:12.440
in this department is currently
showing,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.985
it actually alters,
… the presence of the

00:11:16.985 --> 00:11:20.602
fish in the lake,
causes an induced response in

00:11:20.602 --> 00:11:22.808
the life history of the
zooplankton,

00:11:22.808 --> 00:11:25.908
and the induced response,
which is basically that they

00:11:25.908 --> 00:11:28.538
shift a lot more energy into
reproduction--

00:11:28.538 --> 00:11:30.380
not of growth,
because they're going to get

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.586
hammered by the predator--
that causes them to reallocate

00:11:33.586 --> 00:11:37.607
their fat reserves in such a way
that the ratio of elements in

00:11:37.607 --> 00:11:39.190
their bodies changes.
 

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.841
So these kinds of changes have
very deep-reaching consequences

00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:46.432
that cascade through the entire
community and affect not only

00:11:46.432 --> 00:11:49.455
energy flow,
but the ratios of elements like

00:11:49.455 --> 00:11:51.850
carbon and phosphorus and
nitrogen,

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.879
that you find in different
parts of the food chain.

00:11:55.879 --> 00:12:00.725
In the rocky intertidal,
the classical story from Bob

00:12:00.725 --> 00:12:03.429
Payne has to with Pisaster.
 

00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:05.769
Pisaster is a keystone predator.
 

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:10.197
By the way, this is an image
taken off of the web,

00:12:10.197 --> 00:12:13.090
which is in the public domain.
 

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.214
Pisaster looks like this,
but that's actually not

00:12:16.214 --> 00:12:16.929
Pisaster.
 

00:12:16.929 --> 00:12:19.409
Pisaster is a bit oranger.
 

00:12:19.409 --> 00:12:28.870
These are mussels, down here;
and these are the barnacles,

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.062
over here;
and these are some predatory

00:12:31.062 --> 00:12:31.500
snails.
 

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.989
So what's going on in the rocky
intertidal is that there's a

00:12:36.989 --> 00:12:42.756
starfish which is eating snails,
and it is also eating limpets,

00:12:42.756 --> 00:12:45.527
like that;
and it's eating mussels,

00:12:45.527 --> 00:12:47.990
like that;
and it's eating barnacles,

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.750
like that.
 

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:54.971
And if you take out the
starfish, which prefers to eat

00:12:54.971 --> 00:13:00.960
mussels, then the mussels
exclude everybody else;

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.806
you just get a forest of
mussels that covers the

00:13:04.806 --> 00:13:05.870
intertidal.
 

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.836
And you put the starfish back
in, and it will eat up the

00:13:09.836 --> 00:13:14.019
mussels and clear space that
allows the others to exist.

00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:19.985
So this gives you the general
starting idea of a trophic

00:13:19.985 --> 00:13:21.070
cascade.
 

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:26.793
So those ideas really come from
Brooks and Dodson's observations

00:13:26.793 --> 00:13:30.519
on a natural experiment with
alewives,

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:36.389
and Payne's manipulation
experiments with starfish.

00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:41.971
And the effects of predation
are seen, under this hypothesis,

00:13:41.971 --> 00:13:46.902
as propagating all the way
through food chains or food

00:13:46.902 --> 00:13:47.740
webs.
 

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.703
There's a key summary paper
here, if you're interested in

00:13:51.703 --> 00:13:52.200
this.
 

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.404
A way to get an anchor in the
literature, and then work

00:13:55.404 --> 00:13:58.017
forward and backward,
through Web of Science,

00:13:58.017 --> 00:14:00.509
is Pace, Kohl,
Carpenter and Kitchell.

00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:05.395
And they define a trophic
cascade as an interaction that

00:14:05.395 --> 00:14:10.726
yields an inverse pattern in
abundance or biomass across more

00:14:10.726 --> 00:14:13.570
than one link in a food web.
 

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.832
So, as an example,
if you have a simple

00:14:16.832 --> 00:14:21.418
three-member food web,
if you have abundant top

00:14:21.418 --> 00:14:24.317
predators,
they are reducing the numbers

00:14:24.317 --> 00:14:28.778
of the middle level consumers,
and they're increasing the

00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:31.990
biomass of the basal producers.
 

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:36.929
So the enemy of my enemy is
my friend,

00:14:36.929 --> 00:14:41.308
is the idea behind a trophic
cascade.

00:14:41.308 --> 00:14:44.820
We have an evocative quote
about this.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.220
So this is Aldo Leopold,
one of America's great

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:53.428
conservationists,
who graduated from the Yale

00:14:53.428 --> 00:14:57.830
School of Forestry about eighty
years ago.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:58.379
Student:  A hundred.
 

00:14:58.379 --> 00:14:59.379
Prof: A hundred?
 

00:14:59.379 --> 00:15:04.408
Is this 100-- is it 100 this
year?

00:15:04.408 --> 00:15:07.126
I'm getting older,
because I actually visited

00:15:07.126 --> 00:15:09.659
Aldo's house in Wisconsin at one
point.

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:11.470
So &gt;.
 

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.860
I'm trying to avoid the
implications of my own age.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:22.107
So he lived at a time when park
naturalists rode around on

00:15:22.107 --> 00:15:25.611
horses,
and he was riding through

00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:29.808
parks, in various parts of the
United States,

00:15:29.808 --> 00:15:33.379
when he made the observations
on which this quote is based.

00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:37.312
So: "Since then I have
lived to see state after state

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:38.899
extirpate its wolves.
 

00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:42.605
I have watched the face of a
many a new wolfless mountain and

00:15:42.605 --> 00:15:46.250
seen the south-facing slopes
wrinkle with a maze of new deer

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.928
trails.
 

00:15:46.928 --> 00:15:50.773
I have seen every edible bush
and seedling browsed,

00:15:50.773 --> 00:15:54.308
first to anemic desuetude and
then to death.

00:15:54.308 --> 00:15:58.919
I have seen every edible tree
defoliated to the height of a

00:15:58.919 --> 00:16:00.509
saddle horn."
 

00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:03.647
So that's the consequence of
pulling the top predator out of

00:16:03.647 --> 00:16:05.190
a North American ecosystem.
 

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:10.846
And these sorts of trophic
cascades can be observed also

00:16:10.846 --> 00:16:17.428
when the logging industry goes
through and clear cuts an area.

00:16:17.428 --> 00:16:21.738
If you have well-developed
forest, deer are at fairly low

00:16:21.738 --> 00:16:26.275
numbers, and therefore mountain
lions are also at fairly low

00:16:26.275 --> 00:16:27.200
numbers.
 

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.182
If you clear-cut the forest,
there's kind of an inverse

00:16:31.182 --> 00:16:32.509
trophic cascade.
 

00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:35.852
The deer build up,
because there's a lot of

00:16:35.852 --> 00:16:36.570
browse.
 

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.895
The mountain lion population
grows up, but then the trees

00:16:39.895 --> 00:16:40.490
grow up.
 

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.440
And as the trees grow up,
the deer go down,

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.529
and then there are too many
mountain lions.

00:16:44.529 --> 00:16:47.583
So when I was in graduate
school in British Columbia in

00:16:47.583 --> 00:16:49.722
Canada,
there was--the forests

00:16:49.722 --> 00:16:52.798
surrounding Vancouver were in
this state,

00:16:52.798 --> 00:16:54.913
at that time,
and there were a bunch of

00:16:54.913 --> 00:16:58.029
hungry mountain lions that were
out looking for food,

00:16:58.029 --> 00:17:00.469
and they would come into the
suburbs of Vancouver and do

00:17:00.469 --> 00:17:01.490
things like eat dogs.
 

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.538
And one day a man went out and
saw a mountain lion dragging his

00:17:04.538 --> 00:17:06.978
son off,
and attacked the mountain lion

00:17:06.978 --> 00:17:09.700
with a boat oar that he happened
to have,

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.838
and drove it away.
 

00:17:10.838 --> 00:17:14.660
So these kinds of things are
actually still going on.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.690
By the way, the boy survived,
the mountain lion was shot.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:22.134
And it's a shame that humans
and wildlife have to interact,

00:17:22.134 --> 00:17:25.115
at that scale;
it's pretty hard on the

00:17:25.115 --> 00:17:28.548
wildlife and it's pretty hard on
the humans.

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:35.509
Okay, here is a summary diagram
of what one means by trophic

00:17:35.509 --> 00:17:36.690
cascade.
 

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.808
So you have a carnivore or a
herbivore and a plant.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.932
And this summary diagram
actually introduces a new

00:17:41.932 --> 00:17:42.568
element.
 

00:17:42.568 --> 00:17:45.098
This is from one of Os
Schmitz's papers.

00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:48.269
Os is a professor in the
Forestry and Environment Science

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:48.779
School.
 

00:17:48.779 --> 00:17:55.339
And what Os is showing is that
besides just changing the

00:17:55.339 --> 00:18:01.192
numbers of the population,
at the intermediate level,

00:18:01.192 --> 00:18:06.843
the presence of a predator--
the carnivore here--will cause

00:18:06.843 --> 00:18:12.711
a herbivore either to reduce its
activity or to shift into a

00:18:12.711 --> 00:18:14.798
different habitat.
 

00:18:14.798 --> 00:18:17.868
And he demonstrated this,
by the way,

00:18:17.868 --> 00:18:20.955
with field manipulation
experiments in which the top

00:18:20.955 --> 00:18:24.365
predator was a spider,
and the herbivore was a

00:18:24.365 --> 00:18:28.545
grasshopper,
and the plant was a grass or a

00:18:28.545 --> 00:18:29.150
forb.
 

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.483
So if you have a lot of
spiders, they will cause the

00:18:33.483 --> 00:18:36.970
grasshoppers to reduce their
activity,

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:41.445
and that will give an indirect
positive effect on the growth

00:18:41.445 --> 00:18:43.038
rate of the plants.
 

00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:48.195
And if you have some
grasshoppers that prefer to eat

00:18:48.195 --> 00:18:51.551
one kind of grass,
but if the spider is

00:18:51.551 --> 00:18:55.558
particularly good at foraging on
that- in that kind of habitat,

00:18:55.558 --> 00:18:59.684
and you introduce a spider,
then it will cause the

00:18:59.684 --> 00:19:04.400
grasshoppers to switch onto the
less preferred plant,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.750
and this actually causes the
community to reorganize.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:13.248
So you shouldn't think that the
effect of a trophic cascade is

00:19:13.248 --> 00:19:18.476
just on the numbers of the
herbivores, or of whatever is at

00:19:18.476 --> 00:19:20.910
the intermediate level.
 

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.432
It changes their behavior,
it changes their habitat

00:19:24.432 --> 00:19:27.352
preference,
and, as I indicated earlier,

00:19:27.352 --> 00:19:29.700
it changes their life
histories--

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.588
in lakes, they have induced
life history responses--

00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:35.598
and it changes their ecological
stoichiometry,

00:19:35.598 --> 00:19:39.430
it changes the ratios of
elements in the freshwater

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.118
system.
 

00:19:40.118 --> 00:19:44.873
So these trophic cascades
really have a lot of effects on

00:19:44.873 --> 00:19:49.202
the rate and the nature of
matter and energy flowing

00:19:49.202 --> 00:19:51.240
through communities.
 

00:19:54.660 --> 00:20:00.586
Some of them are with great big
photogenic BBC quality kinds of

00:20:00.586 --> 00:20:02.019
interactions.
 

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:06.653
Killer whales like to eat sea
otters, and sea otters like to

00:20:06.653 --> 00:20:10.031
eat sea urchins,
and sea urchins like to eat

00:20:10.031 --> 00:20:10.740
kelp.
 

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:18.113
And so one of the classic North
Pacific trophic cascades has to

00:20:18.113 --> 00:20:25.130
do with the density of killer
whales and whether or not they

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.578
prefer to eat sea otters.
 

00:20:28.578 --> 00:20:34.338
Now, it was observed in the
1980s,

00:20:34.338 --> 00:20:38.290
1990s and early twenty-first
century that killer whales were

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:41.573
developing an increasing
preference for eating sea

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:43.194
otters;
which, by the way,

00:20:43.194 --> 00:20:46.048
had previously been pretty much
eliminated by the- from the

00:20:46.048 --> 00:20:49.000
system by Russian fur traders,
and then had come back in.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.730
And sea otters are something
that people love to observe.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:54.690
They're extremely cute.
 

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.440
So they have some conservation
cachet.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.088
Do any of you have--given the
context we're operating in,

00:21:03.088 --> 00:21:06.779
community ecology,
anybody have an idea on why it

00:21:06.779 --> 00:21:11.009
is that killer whales decided to
eat more sea otters?

00:21:14.368 --> 00:21:17.836
Was there something that they
might previously have eaten,

00:21:17.836 --> 00:21:19.539
that wasn't there anymore?
 

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.460
Student:  Sardines.
 

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.430
Prof: Sardines.
 

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.670
No, killer whales actually have
a hard time handling sardines.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.730
They're a bit small for a
killer whale.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:31.269
Student:  Salmon.
 

00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:35.240
Prof: Salmon, yes;
Alaska salmon fishery crashed.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.930
Killer whales got hungry and
started eating sea otters.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:42.068
That's exactly it.
 

00:21:42.068 --> 00:21:44.880
So these kinds of things are
going on all the time,

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.792
and predators can switch,
and that's what caused this

00:21:48.792 --> 00:21:52.329
particular trophic cascade to
become obvious.

00:21:52.329 --> 00:21:53.470
Okay?
 

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.720
The killer whale switched onto
sea otters.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.088
The sea otters declined.
 

00:21:58.088 --> 00:22:01.885
Because the sea otters
declined, the sea urchins went

00:22:01.885 --> 00:22:06.558
up, and because the sea urchins
increased, the kelp went down.

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:12.102
So this is from that paper by
Carpenter and Kitchell and

00:22:12.102 --> 00:22:13.009
others.
 

00:22:13.009 --> 00:22:17.309
And the take-home message from
this--I certainly do not ever

00:22:17.309 --> 00:22:20.588
expect you to memorize something
like that.

00:22:20.588 --> 00:22:23.194
It might be nice to go through
and pick out one or two favorite

00:22:23.194 --> 00:22:25.218
examples,
or it could be useful as a way

00:22:25.218 --> 00:22:27.038
to get an entry to the
literature,

00:22:27.038 --> 00:22:29.430
if you wanted to write a paper
on it.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:33.462
But it's to show you that
trophic cascades have been now

00:22:33.462 --> 00:22:36.910
identified in marine,
freshwater and terrestrial

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:37.788
systems.
 

00:22:37.788 --> 00:22:40.009
And there are some very
interesting ones.

00:22:40.009 --> 00:22:43.394
For example,
mantids affect insects which

00:22:43.394 --> 00:22:46.055
affect plants;
lizards affect grasshoppers

00:22:46.055 --> 00:22:49.665
which affect plants;
wolves affect moose which

00:22:49.665 --> 00:22:54.779
affect balsam fir;
mosquitoes, mosquito larvae eat

00:22:54.779 --> 00:22:59.480
protozoa, which eat bacteria;
etcetera. Okay?

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.900
So there are a lot of them.
 

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.641
And it turns out that they play
an important organizing role in

00:23:05.641 --> 00:23:07.400
a lot of communities.
 

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:15.657
Okay so, so far basically we've
seen that the initial view of

00:23:15.657 --> 00:23:21.960
how a community is structured--
which is that everything in it

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.095
is competing,
and the number species in it

00:23:24.095 --> 00:23:26.720
are determined by competition--
was then modified by

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.112
experiments and observations
that indicated that predators

00:23:30.112 --> 00:23:32.788
have an important influence in
food webs,

00:23:32.788 --> 00:23:37.453
and that if predators are
selectively eating superior

00:23:37.453 --> 00:23:40.461
competitors,
then they will maintain

00:23:40.461 --> 00:23:44.288
biodiversity and they will cause
a trophic cascade,

00:23:44.288 --> 00:23:48.395
in the enemy of my enemy is
a friend for the lower

00:23:48.395 --> 00:23:50.690
things,
kind of pattern.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:58.727
Any idea why predators might
prefer the competitively

00:23:58.727 --> 00:24:01.200
superior prey?
 

00:24:04.808 --> 00:24:05.490
Student:  There's more
of them.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.210
Prof: There's more of
them,

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.007
and so over evolutionary time
they may very well have been

00:24:11.007 --> 00:24:14.048
shaped by evolution to be really
good at eating the things that

00:24:14.048 --> 00:24:15.079
were most common.
 

00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:16.318
Yes?
 

00:24:16.318 --> 00:24:19.023
Student:  I was going to
say, in certain habits,

00:24:19.023 --> 00:24:21.930
they all might be larger than
the successful subspecies.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:22.808
Prof: That's right.
 

00:24:22.808 --> 00:24:26.327
And so if you are an
economically clever predator,

00:24:26.327 --> 00:24:30.349
you might take the biggest
packet of energy available.

00:24:30.349 --> 00:24:31.740
Right.
 

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.032
And, of course,
if being a good competitor

00:24:34.032 --> 00:24:36.160
actually makes you more
vulnerable,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.005
for some reason--if you are a
tub of lard that can't move very

00:24:40.005 --> 00:24:42.930
fast--
then that might do it too.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:48.116
Okay, now given--that was just
a little summary of where we are

00:24:48.116 --> 00:24:48.868
so far.
 

00:24:48.868 --> 00:24:51.317
Now let's see what other kinds
of things will affect community

00:24:51.317 --> 00:24:51.798
structure.
 

00:24:51.798 --> 00:24:54.440
Because all of this is very
good in theory,

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.971
but when you actually go out
there in the real world and you

00:24:56.971 --> 00:25:00.006
look at a real world community,
there are some important things

00:25:00.006 --> 00:25:02.598
going on that haven't yet been
put into analysis,

00:25:02.598 --> 00:25:04.730
into the analysis,
and one of them is history.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:09.538
So during the last Ice Age,
patterns were created in North

00:25:09.538 --> 00:25:15.190
America that have allowed people
to reconstruct what's going on,

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:20.126
and Margaret Davis did
excellent work reconstructing

00:25:20.126 --> 00:25:26.420
the history of the reassembly of
the forests of North America,

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.180
after the ice went off.
 

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:33.027
And Rosie Gillespie has been-
is currently doing a similar

00:25:33.027 --> 00:25:37.703
kind of reconstruction of the
assembly of communities in

00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:38.640
Hawaii.
 

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:44.509
And in both cases there are
probes into time.

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:50.253
In the case of the deciduous
forests, the probes are

00:25:50.253 --> 00:25:54.592
essentially pollen;
oh, and I'll wrap up with Bob

00:25:54.592 --> 00:25:56.700
Ricklef's general perspective.
 

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:04.057
So what Margaret Davis did was
she went over eastern North

00:26:04.057 --> 00:26:08.069
America;
and you can see from the black

00:26:08.069 --> 00:26:11.880
dots where she took a lot of her
samples.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.630
Okay?
 

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:18.845
And these are places where
there was a lake or a bog into

00:26:18.845 --> 00:26:24.432
which pollen was falling into
fine layers that could be dated

00:26:24.432 --> 00:26:25.548
by year.
 

00:26:25.548 --> 00:26:30.147
And if you have an undisturbed
bog, you are able to go down and

00:26:30.147 --> 00:26:33.559
make a core in it and actually
count each year,

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:34.970
as you go back.
 

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:38.998
So, of course,
this kind of thing can also be

00:26:38.998 --> 00:26:43.875
confirmed by carbon 14 dating,
and you can get a number of

00:26:43.875 --> 00:26:47.450
crosschecks on the accuracy of
your reconstruction.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:52.253
What you see is that at the
time of the full glacial extent

00:26:52.253 --> 00:26:56.385
of the Wisconsin Ice Sheet,
you'll notice that it probed

00:26:56.385 --> 00:26:58.680
down well into southern Indiana
here,

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.980
and actually it came--right
under here it is out over Long

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:03.660
Island.
 

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:09.644
The shoreline had dropped,
as water was withdrawn from the

00:27:09.644 --> 00:27:12.269
oceans into the icecap.
 

00:27:12.269 --> 00:27:16.738
We had tundra conditions in
southern New York and in

00:27:16.738 --> 00:27:20.810
Pennsylvania,
and you had a spruce pine

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:27.009
forest that went all the way
down into southern Georgia and

00:27:27.009 --> 00:27:30.595
north Texas,
and then you had a kind of a

00:27:30.595 --> 00:27:33.140
refuge down here for deciduous
trees.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:38.420
And as you can see from this
sketch over here on the side,

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.442
if you wash the sediments out,
pollen has the great

00:27:42.442 --> 00:27:46.811
advantage--
if you're a palynologist--of

00:27:46.811 --> 00:27:50.609
preserving its shape very well.
 

00:27:50.609 --> 00:27:52.420
Pollen is really tough stuff.
 

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:57.144
The plants have evolved a lot
of ways of preserving their

00:27:57.144 --> 00:28:00.519
precious DNA,
and that serves us well.

00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:03.451
So this is--you're not looking
at DNA here, you're looking at

00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:06.528
the various kinds of structures
that pollen gets packaged in.

00:28:06.528 --> 00:28:09.674
The important thing is they're
really well preserved in pollen,

00:28:09.674 --> 00:28:11.400
and you can tell the
difference.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.269
Okay?
 

00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:18.048
So when Margaret reconstructed
these things,

00:28:18.048 --> 00:28:21.160
she discovered that the first
things to come back north,

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.519
after the ice melted off,
were spruce and larch.

00:28:24.519 --> 00:28:30.750
And so this is basically how
long ago it was that spruce got

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:34.131
this far north:
14,000 years ago,

00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:38.327
12,000 years ago;
10,000 years ago it was pushing

00:28:38.327 --> 00:28:39.348
up into Canada.
 

00:28:39.348 --> 00:28:44.368
Larch moving up at a fairly
similar rate;

00:28:44.368 --> 00:28:50.805
up here getting a bit north of
Quebec City, about 8000 years

00:28:50.805 --> 00:28:51.460
ago.
 

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.798
So you can reconstruct that
pattern for these conifers,

00:28:55.798 --> 00:28:59.894
and then you can also
reconstruct it for hickory and

00:28:59.894 --> 00:29:00.940
chestnut.
 

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.865
So hickory gets to Maine about
4000 years ago,

00:29:04.865 --> 00:29:08.880
and chestnut only gets there
1500 years ago.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.618
Now, if you were sitting at any
particular spot,

00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:17.755
like say Albany,
and you lived for 10,000 years

00:29:17.755 --> 00:29:23.509
and you were just checking off
well when did that one arrive,

00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:25.930
and when did that one arrive,
and when did that one arrive,

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.528
you would see them coming in at
different times.

00:29:28.528 --> 00:29:30.770
And, by the way,
just as a note on the

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.858
importance of disease in
structuring ecosystems,

00:29:33.858 --> 00:29:37.558
at one point there was
evidently an outbreak of a

00:29:37.558 --> 00:29:42.105
forest disease that pretty much
cleared out an area that ran

00:29:42.105 --> 00:29:44.880
from Massachusetts to Minnesota.
 

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.910
That happened about 10 or
12,000 years ago.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.788
So the forests just basically
all died, and then they were

00:29:52.788 --> 00:29:55.784
re-established,
and it probably was a disease

00:29:55.784 --> 00:29:58.779
or a forest insect outbreak that
did it.

00:29:58.779 --> 00:30:01.038
That's also in the record.
 

00:30:01.038 --> 00:30:03.335
So they come,
in at any particular point,

00:30:03.335 --> 00:30:04.538
at different times.
 

00:30:04.538 --> 00:30:10.242
Now that's an important comment
on the idea of ecological

00:30:10.242 --> 00:30:13.631
succession,
because a modern community,

00:30:13.631 --> 00:30:16.608
if you were just to look at it
in time,

00:30:16.608 --> 00:30:20.230
and you were to forget history,
it would--

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.103
you could take communities from
across a broad range of North

00:30:23.103 --> 00:30:25.545
America and they would all have
very similar species

00:30:25.545 --> 00:30:28.194
compositions;
they would all have these

00:30:28.194 --> 00:30:31.720
different hardwood and conifer
species in them.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.509
And it might be that you would
postulate that--

00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:40.770
you'd have a working
hypothesis--that these species

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:45.798
had to be there in a particular
mix in order to co-exist.

00:30:45.798 --> 00:30:48.828
The historical record indicates
that's not true at all.

00:30:48.828 --> 00:30:52.440
They had quite different
sequences of assembly.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.651
So it wasn't as though one
species prepared the way for the

00:30:56.651 --> 00:30:57.160
next.
 

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.557
One happened along in one
place, and another happened

00:31:00.557 --> 00:31:03.890
along in another place,
and they all ended up making

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.700
communities of a fairly similar
nature.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.875
In particular,
the hardwoods came in,

00:31:08.875 --> 00:31:10.930
in a lot of different
sequences.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:15.019
Some are going fast,
some are going slow.

00:31:15.019 --> 00:31:19.692
So it looks like the tree
species you see in an eastern

00:31:19.692 --> 00:31:24.970
hardwood forest can be assembled
in an almost random order.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:28.286
By the way, the rates of their
dispersal are determined a lot

00:31:28.286 --> 00:31:30.108
by what kind of seeds they had.
 

00:31:30.108 --> 00:31:34.244
Something like a hickory or an
oak is going to move north about

00:31:34.244 --> 00:31:37.180
at the rate at which squirrels
bury seeds.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:41.640
So it's going to be about 50 or
100 meters per generation,

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.108
max.
 

00:31:42.108 --> 00:31:46.031
Something like a maple,
that has a nice little

00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:49.954
helicopter seed,
can go north on the winds and

00:31:49.954 --> 00:31:53.529
can move hundreds of miles at a
clip.

00:31:53.529 --> 00:31:58.670
So the take-home message from
Margaret Davis's analysis of the

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:02.883
eastern hardwood forest is
species assemblages come

00:32:02.883 --> 00:32:07.348
together in a potentially fairly
random sequence.

00:32:07.348 --> 00:32:10.509
It isn't as though one thing
prepares the way for the next.

00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:16.507
Now let's take a look at what's
going on with spiders that are

00:32:16.507 --> 00:32:18.670
ecomorphs in Hawaii.
 

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:22.546
And by the way,
these are the happy-face

00:32:22.546 --> 00:32:26.209
spiders;
so some of them have a little

00:32:26.209 --> 00:32:31.180
mark on them that makes them
look like they're happy.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:38.771
And what are marked here are a
group of the green ecomorph,

00:32:38.771 --> 00:32:42.890
which is waikamoi;
this one.

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:50.189
And then there is a maroon
ecomorph, which is this group up

00:32:50.189 --> 00:32:51.068
here.
 

00:32:51.068 --> 00:32:55.358
And we have a small brown one
and a large brown one.

00:32:55.358 --> 00:32:58.486
So this one doesn't look too
brown, but they're called the

00:32:58.486 --> 00:33:00.568
small brown and the large brown
one.

00:33:00.568 --> 00:33:04.125
So you can already see that
there's something going on with

00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:07.375
these spiders that looks
something like the lizards in

00:33:07.375 --> 00:33:11.008
the Caribbean,
the anole lizards that have

00:33:11.008 --> 00:33:15.028
different ecomorphs in the same
community,

00:33:15.028 --> 00:33:19.450
and that that pattern repeats
itself on different islands.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:20.470
Okay?
 

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:28.832
Now the oldest island is Kauai;
the second oldest is Oahu--of

00:33:28.832 --> 00:33:32.266
the major islands--
and then Maui Nui--which is

00:33:32.266 --> 00:33:35.655
Maui-Molokai-Lanai--
and which, by the way,

00:33:35.655 --> 00:33:38.630
was all one island during the
Pleistocene--

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:39.940
is a younger island.
 

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.548
And then some of these things
are on the Big Island,

00:33:42.548 --> 00:33:45.413
which is--the oldest rock on
the Big Island is only about

00:33:45.413 --> 00:33:46.539
400,000 years old.
 

00:33:46.539 --> 00:33:48.220
Kauai is about 5 million.
 

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.279
Oahu is about 2.6 million.
 

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:52.210
Oahu is 1 million something.
 

00:33:56.088 --> 00:34:02.695
Yeah, 2.6 million for one
volcano on Oahu and 3.7 for the

00:34:02.695 --> 00:34:03.640
other.
 

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:09.210
Kauai out at about 5 million,
and Hawaii at about 0.4.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:13.237
So there are a couple of
messages, when you look at these

00:34:13.237 --> 00:34:14.030
patterns.
 

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:18.608
And you should think of the
spiders as having started from

00:34:18.608 --> 00:34:21.659
Kauai and then moved down the
chain.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.010
And there are two things that
can go on.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.369
You can either have speciation
or you can have assembly.

00:34:27.369 --> 00:34:30.496
The difference in those words
means the following:

00:34:30.496 --> 00:34:33.248
If you have assembly,
it means that a bunch of

00:34:33.248 --> 00:34:35.940
evolution went on and generated
a bunch of species,

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.260
which we have over here in a
pool, and then they migrated;

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:43.650
and then communities got put
together, with pre-existing

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:44.449
species.
 

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:49.097
If you have speciation going
on, it meant that an ancestor

00:34:49.097 --> 00:34:52.440
came in and that it speciated
locally,

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.409
on whatever island,
and that a community got

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:58.518
assembled out of the clade that
developed,

00:34:58.518 --> 00:34:59.619
with the different species in
it.

00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:03.449
So that's the distinction
between assembly and speciation.

00:35:03.449 --> 00:35:04.510
Okay?
 

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:06.612
And with T.
 

00:35:06.612 --> 00:35:16.550
quasimodo, you can see a spider
that evolved here,

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:23.132
and then spread down the chain,
so that this particular one

00:35:23.132 --> 00:35:26.260
evolved on Oahu,
this brown one,

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.887
and then became part of the
assembly process in the other

00:35:29.887 --> 00:35:30.599
islands.
 

00:35:30.599 --> 00:35:33.960
It crops up all over the place.
 

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.150
So this is where that
particular species originated,

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:42.586
and then it became part of
these other communities by a

00:35:42.586 --> 00:35:44.559
process of assembly.
 

00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:50.230
The second thing you can see is
that the diversity of the

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:53.576
communities,
which is indicated when you

00:35:53.576 --> 00:35:57.414
have four of them present,
appears to be highest--you

00:35:57.414 --> 00:36:01.079
only, you get that on Maui and
you get it here,

00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:04.239
on Oahu--it appears to be
highest in communities of

00:36:04.239 --> 00:36:05.440
intermediate age.
 

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.326
On the Island of Hawaii,
which is young,

00:36:08.326 --> 00:36:11.434
and on the Island of Kauai,
which is older,

00:36:11.434 --> 00:36:14.469
the communities appear to be
simpler.

00:36:14.469 --> 00:36:19.869
And I must say that this is
kind of a rescue process to get

00:36:19.869 --> 00:36:23.833
this pattern,
because these--Hawaii is the

00:36:23.833 --> 00:36:28.621
extinction capital of the world,
and so there are a lot of

00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:32.543
people who are working to
document these patterns before

00:36:32.543 --> 00:36:34.469
it's no longer possible.
 

00:36:34.469 --> 00:36:38.190
One of the important things
that sort of confirms

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:42.762
Hutchinson's view of species
packing is that Rosie has never

00:36:42.762 --> 00:36:48.110
found two species that share the
same ecomorph in the same place;

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:51.260
so that locally these things
sort out.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:54.402
And the maximum number of
spiders you're going to get

00:36:54.402 --> 00:36:55.489
locally is four.
 

00:36:55.489 --> 00:36:58.070
And they're going to be in
these different ecomorphs.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.659
They're going to be using
different parts of the habitat;

00:37:00.659 --> 00:37:02.639
they're going to be behaving
differently;

00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:03.820
and they're going to be colored
differently.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:07.936
And if you go back and you ask
yourself, "How are they

00:37:07.936 --> 00:37:10.280
related phylogenetically?"
 

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.630
you will see that,
for example,

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:16.942
the maroon one can have a green
ancestor or a dark brown

00:37:16.942 --> 00:37:20.014
ancestor,
and the light brown one can

00:37:20.014 --> 00:37:22.719
have usually a dark brown
ancestor,

00:37:22.719 --> 00:37:25.250
but over here it had a green
ancestor.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:29.922
So the phylogeny indicates that
the ecomorphs are arrived at

00:37:29.922 --> 00:37:32.572
convergently,
and the phylogeography

00:37:32.572 --> 00:37:36.217
indicates that both speciation
and assemblage have put them

00:37:36.217 --> 00:37:39.461
together into communities;
and the local pattern indicates

00:37:39.461 --> 00:37:41.619
that you're never going to get
more than four.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:52.250
Well, take now that vision of
history,

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.365
that was given to us by
Margaret Davis and by Rosie

00:37:55.365 --> 00:37:58.233
Gillespie and by others,
and let's ask ourselves,

00:37:58.233 --> 00:37:59.860
are there some general
patterns?

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:03.465
That's what Bob Ricklefs,
the question Bob Ricklefs posed

00:38:03.465 --> 00:38:04.110
himself.
 

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:07.130
Here you have an eastern
hardwood forest;

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.489
to remind us of what we're
looking at.

00:38:08.489 --> 00:38:12.050
This is in the Appalachians.
 

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:17.250
The historical perspective says
that there's--

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:21.943
the historical and the spatial
perspective put together suggest

00:38:21.943 --> 00:38:25.730
that there's no such thing as a
local community.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:29.480
Every community on the planet
has been influenced by

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.570
large-scale processes in space
and time.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:36.280
The regional and the historical
forces that are acting on

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.529
communities are just as
important as predation and

00:38:39.529 --> 00:38:42.260
competition;
maybe even more so.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:46.360
So if you want to understand
those processes,

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:51.860
you have to analyze them at a
scale that's big enough to see

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.699
them.
 

00:38:52.699 --> 00:38:55.655
And therefore there is now a
discipline which is called

00:38:55.655 --> 00:38:57.737
macroecology,
that tries to study these

00:38:57.737 --> 00:39:00.530
things at the scale of the
planet, if possible.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:04.639
At that scale you can see that
dispersal is integrating things

00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:07.739
across regions,
and therefore it is causing the

00:39:07.739 --> 00:39:10.300
process of assembly to take
place;

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.110
dispersal is bringing the
species in from other places.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:18.563
And we can trace that process,
as you've seen with Rosie's

00:39:18.563 --> 00:39:22.550
phylogenetic tree,
using molecular phylogenetics.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:32.990
If you create a landscape in a
computer, and simulate this

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:37.480
process, there's an interesting
pattern that pops up.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:43.119
This is from some of Michel
Loreau's work.

00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:46.648
On the Y-axis we have species
richness, and over here we have

00:39:46.648 --> 00:39:49.722
how much dispersal is going on;
how much are things moving

00:39:49.722 --> 00:39:50.679
around the landscape?
 

00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:55.768
And we have a couple of
different definitions.

00:39:55.768 --> 00:39:56.559
Okay?
 

00:39:56.559 --> 00:39:59.320
We have local diversity and
regional diversity.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.278
So local diversity is going to
be how many species you can

00:40:03.278 --> 00:40:07.030
count in a local patch,
and regional diversity would be

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.670
how much can you count in a
state?

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:12.956
Local diversity say for a lake
in Connecticut would be how many

00:40:12.956 --> 00:40:14.599
species are in Lindsley Pond?
 

00:40:14.599 --> 00:40:17.507
Regional diversity would be how
many fish do we find in the

00:40:17.507 --> 00:40:18.659
State of Connecticut?
 

00:40:18.659 --> 00:40:20.409
Something like that, okay?
 

00:40:20.409 --> 00:40:26.130
So the local diversity first
increases and then decreases,

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:28.639
as dispersal increases.
 

00:40:28.639 --> 00:40:33.885
Okay, so that means that the
uniqueness of each species

00:40:33.885 --> 00:40:39.811
assembly is going to start going
up, as you increase dispersal

00:40:39.811 --> 00:40:40.880
from 0.
 

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.375
And then as you start
dispersing right across the

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:47.070
whole landscape,
you homogenize it.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:51.750
So the uniqueness of a local
community goes down.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:57.018
The regional diversity stays
stable until local diversity

00:40:57.018 --> 00:41:00.599
hits a peak,
and then the regional diversity

00:41:00.599 --> 00:41:03.449
starts to decline,
along with the local diversity.

00:41:03.449 --> 00:41:07.250
So as you just increase
dispersal more and more and more

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.728
and more,
you decrease the opportunities

00:41:10.728 --> 00:41:16.114
for unique species to exist in
places where they're favored by

00:41:16.114 --> 00:41:19.563
isolation,
and you get maximum

00:41:19.563 --> 00:41:25.619
biodiversity at an intermediate
level of dispersal.

00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:32.210
Well, if we now look at a real
world pattern,

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:36.389
rather than at a simulation
model, and we ask,

00:41:36.389 --> 00:41:41.313
do we really see what we might
expect to see in something like

00:41:41.313 --> 00:41:43.250
the Amazon Rainforest?
 

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:46.737
Then what we see is that a
tropical forest really isn't

00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:50.485
completely assembled by random
dispersal, from some kind of

00:41:50.485 --> 00:41:52.360
regional pool of species.
 

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.280
Some species are much more
widespread than expected.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.500
So this is the reference on
that.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:06.268
And basically what you see,
if you look across distance,

00:42:06.268 --> 00:42:11.996
and look at the fraction of the
species that are shared between

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:15.454
any two points--
in Panama, which is a fairly

00:42:15.454 --> 00:42:17.512
small country,
on this scale,

00:42:17.512 --> 00:42:22.079
you can see that as you go out,
the fraction of species that

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:25.135
are shared,
say if you took it two points

00:42:25.135 --> 00:42:28.199
that are fifty or sixty
kilometers apart,

00:42:28.199 --> 00:42:31.041
they're only sharing about
fifteen percent of their

00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:31.610
species.
 

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:35.139
But if you go into Ecuador and
Peru,

00:42:35.139 --> 00:42:38.610
and you look at the fraction
that are shared,

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:43.380
across the huge expanse of
trees that are available in the

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.266
Amazon Basin,
you find that there are some

00:42:47.266 --> 00:42:51.179
trees which are shared at great
distances.

00:42:51.179 --> 00:42:55.599
They've spread across the
forest and they are right across

00:42:55.599 --> 00:42:57.460
much of the continent.
 

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:03.588
So regional processes really
look quite different when you

00:43:03.588 --> 00:43:06.152
take the map,
like a rubber,

00:43:06.152 --> 00:43:09.440
and just stretch it out,
so that things can live in a

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.239
larger area.
 

00:43:13.659 --> 00:43:15.681
And by the way,
there's quite a bit of history

00:43:15.681 --> 00:43:16.760
going on here as well.
 

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.119
In the Amazon Basin,
during the Pleistocene,

00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:23.929
much of the basin was actually
savanna--

00:43:23.929 --> 00:43:27.282
up until about 12,000 years ago
it was fairly dry in South

00:43:27.282 --> 00:43:29.980
America--
and there were refugia.

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:36.590
There was a refuge up near the
Andes in Peru and Ecuador.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:39.686
There was a refuge in the
Atlantic Forest,

00:43:39.686 --> 00:43:44.291
and then there was another one
that was up in the highlands of

00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:45.349
Venezuela.
 

00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:50.300
And that huge forest,
which now covers a third or a

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:54.954
half of South America,
has expanded out of those

00:43:54.954 --> 00:43:58.619
refugia in the last 10,000
years.

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:02.385
And you can see that some of
those trees were probably able

00:44:02.385 --> 00:44:05.608
to move fairly long distances,
fairly rapidly,

00:44:05.608 --> 00:44:08.989
to get there and cover much of
the rainforest.

00:44:08.989 --> 00:44:14.121
By the way, the rainforest of
the Amazon is not yet in stable

00:44:14.121 --> 00:44:17.969
age distribution since the last
glaciation.

00:44:17.969 --> 00:44:20.550
You should not think of it as a
stable ecosystem.

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:23.998
The thing comes and goes,
and it's in a process of

00:44:23.998 --> 00:44:25.829
transition all the time.
 

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:31.177
Okay, today I've tried to give
you a bit of the intellectual

00:44:31.177 --> 00:44:35.427
history of community ecology,
starting with an idea of

00:44:35.427 --> 00:44:38.179
communities in some sort of
stable equilibrium,

00:44:38.179 --> 00:44:42.230
determined by competition.
 

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:45.684
Then the idea of top-down
control, through predation and

00:44:45.684 --> 00:44:48.610
dispersal;
predation giving top-down

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:53.210
control, and then dispersal and
assembly in a regional

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:54.340
framework.
 

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:58.137
And then the perspective of
time, that communities are

00:44:58.137 --> 00:45:02.583
assembled through time,
and that this occurs at a

00:45:02.583 --> 00:45:07.059
geological timescale,
with glaciers coming and going,

00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:10.650
and at a longer time scale with
continents drifting.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:14.494
I think that really the
communities are driven mostly by

00:45:14.494 --> 00:45:17.851
the glacial cycle,
rather than by the continental

00:45:17.851 --> 00:45:18.969
drift cycle.
 

00:45:18.969 --> 00:45:25.110
And that means that when you
look at something locally,

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:26.748
you have to be able,
in your mind,

00:45:26.748 --> 00:45:29.233
to integrate across these
levels when you form your

00:45:29.233 --> 00:45:32.126
questions,
because they suggest important

00:45:32.126 --> 00:45:35.849
alternative hypotheses that you
might want to test.

00:45:35.849 --> 00:45:39.692
Okay, next time is Island
Biogeography and

00:45:39.692 --> 00:45:41.380
Metapopulations.

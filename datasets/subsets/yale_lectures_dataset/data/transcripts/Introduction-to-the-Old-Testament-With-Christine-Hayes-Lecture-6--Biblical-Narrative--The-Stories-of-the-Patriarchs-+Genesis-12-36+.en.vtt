00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.633
Professor Christine
Hayes: So last time we

00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:04.697
started discussing the
historical merits of the

00:00:04.697 --> 00:00:07.300
biblical stories of the
patriarchs and the matriarchs.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.460
These are contained in Genesis
12 through 50.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.840
Scholarly opinion on this
matter is seriously divided;

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.890
something you need to know.
 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.088
Some scholars will point to
internal biblical evidence for

00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:23.006
the authenticity and the
antiquity of the patriarchal

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:24.709
stories.
So for example,

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:28.345
Nahum Sarna argues that
representing Abraham and Isaac

00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:32.324
and Jacob as foreigners and
strangers in Canaan is hardly a

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:35.822
convenient tradition for a
people who are seeking to

00:00:35.822 --> 00:00:38.910
establish their claim to its
homeland.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.163
And if this myth of origins
were the fabrication of a later

00:00:42.163 --> 00:00:45.640
writer, then surely they would
have written the story in such a

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.230
way as to give their ancestors a
less tenuous hold or claim,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.080
connection, to the land.
 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.781
He also notes that some of the
material in the patriarchal

00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:56.720
stories would be offensive to
later religious sensibilities.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.200
Jacob is married to two sisters
simultaneously.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.757
That is something that is
explicitly forbidden in the book

00:01:01.757 --> 00:01:04.440
of Deuteronomy.
Wouldn't a later writer have

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.692
cleaned up this ancestral record
if this were in fact something

00:01:08.692 --> 00:01:10.750
composed at a later period?
 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.958
Also, he notes that the
representation of inter-ethnic

00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.833
relationships in the patriarchal
stories does not accord with the

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.650
reality of a later period.
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.391
So for example,
the Arameans are considered

00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:24.349
close kin to the Israelites.
 

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:27.080
"A wandering Aramean was my
father," it says.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.493
And spouses are always
chosen--daughters for sons are

00:01:30.493 --> 00:01:34.497
always chosen by going back to
the Aramean people and choosing

00:01:34.497 --> 00:01:36.269
someone from close kin.
 

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:39.507
But in the period of the
monarchy--that's going to be

00:01:39.507 --> 00:01:43.367
after 1000--in the period of the
monarchy, there were very poor

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:45.360
relations with the Arameans.
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.680
They were bitter enemies.
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.445
So why, according to scholars
like Sarna, would a biblical

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:54.410
author from that period portray
the Arameans as close kin,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.760
unless they had some older
tradition, established tradition

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.319
that reflected that fact?
 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.755
So Sarna and other scholars
hold that the patriarchal

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:06.586
traditions are not entirely
fabricated retrojections from a

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:10.409
later period.
They contain authentic memories

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.370
of an earlier historic
situation.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.527
The patriarchs,
it's maintained,

00:02:15.527 --> 00:02:16.850
were semi-nomads.
 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.009
They lived in tents.
 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:20.269
From time to time,
they wandered to Egypt or

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.370
Mesopotamia often in search of
pasture for their animals.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.515
And various details of their
language, their customs,

00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:29.028
their laws, their religion,
it's argued,

00:02:29.028 --> 00:02:32.629
seem to fit well into the
period of the Late Bronze Age.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.122
I've given you the periods at
the top of the chart:

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:40.056
early Bronze Age;
middle Bronze Age from about

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:42.903
2100 to 1550;
we date the late Bronze age

00:02:42.903 --> 00:02:46.275
from about 1550 until 1200--the
introduction of iron and the

00:02:46.275 --> 00:02:48.389
beginning of the Iron Age in
1200.

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:49.780
Prior to that,
the Bronze Age,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.889
which is divided into these
three periods.

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.007
So that's on the one hand:
scholars who see these stories

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:57.958
as reflecting historical
memories and having a certain

00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.349
authenticity to them.
 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.892
Then on the other hand,
at the other extreme,

00:03:01.892 --> 00:03:05.358
you have scholars who see the
patriarchal stories as entirely

00:03:05.358 --> 00:03:08.189
fabricated retrojections of a
much later age.

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.416
And they vary significantly as
to when they think these stories

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:13.705
were written:
anywhere from the period of the

00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:16.151
monarchy all the way down to the
fourth century,

00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.193
some of them.
Works published in the 1970s by

00:03:19.193 --> 00:03:22.240
authors like Thomas Thompson,
Jon Van Seters,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.779
take the position that these
stories are filled with

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.207
anachronisms,
their chronologies are

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.987
confused.
These anachronisms and confused

00:03:30.987 --> 00:03:34.802
chronologies in the patriarchal
stories are the rule rather than

00:03:34.802 --> 00:03:38.779
the exception in their view,
and they are evidence of a very

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:40.539
late date of composition.
 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:44.022
So you have these two extremes
based on the internal evidence

00:03:44.022 --> 00:03:45.300
of the Bible itself.
 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.500
But you also have the same two
extreme positions reflected in

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.740
the discipline of archaeology.
 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.541
In the early days,
archaeology of the region

00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:57.840
tended toward credulity.
 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.174
And it was explicitly referred
to as biblical archaeology--an

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.663
interesting name,
because it suggests that the

00:04:03.663 --> 00:04:06.531
archaeologists were out there
searching for evidence that

00:04:06.531 --> 00:04:09.039
would verify the details of the
biblical text.

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:10.389
We're doing biblical
archaeology;

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.270
archeology in support of the
biblical text.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.192
I mentioned last time William
F.

00:04:15.192 --> 00:04:17.550
Albright, an American
archaeologist.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.635
He believed strongly that
archaeological findings were

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:23.895
important external evidence for
the basic historicity and

00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:25.789
authenticity of,
for example,

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.310
the patriarchal stories.
 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.452
And certainly some
archaeological findings were

00:04:30.452 --> 00:04:31.750
quite remarkable.
 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.874
Scholars of the Albright school
pointed to texts and clay

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:38.110
tablets that were discovered in
second millennium sites.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.815
So you see down on the bottom
the second millennium BCE,

00:04:40.815 --> 00:04:45.339
obviously going down to 1000;
first millennium: 1000 to 0.

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:47.811
The second millennium really
wasn't longer than the first

00:04:47.811 --> 00:04:49.930
millennium, it's just that I ran
out of board!

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.473
But specifically sites like
Nuzi and Mari--I've placed them

00:04:53.473 --> 00:04:57.200
in their approximate places on
the timeline--Nuzi and Mari are

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.743
sites that are near the area
that's identified in the Bible

00:05:00.743 --> 00:05:04.531
as being the ancestral home of
the patriarchs in Mesopotamia or

00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:07.220
on the highway from there to
Canaan.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.563
These texts and clay tablets
were believed to illuminate many

00:05:10.563 --> 00:05:12.569
biblical customs and
institutions.

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.920
So in the Nuzi texts from about
the middle of the second

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.452
millennium, we learn of the
custom of adoption for purposes

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:22.797
of inheritance,
particularly the adoption of a

00:05:22.797 --> 00:05:25.350
slave in the absence of
offspring.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.529
Biblical scholars got very
excited about this.

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:30.219
They point to the biblical
passage in which Abraham

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:32.639
expresses to God his fear that
his servant,

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.724
Eliezer, will have to be the
one to inherit God's promise

00:05:36.724 --> 00:05:38.839
because Abraham has no son.
 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:42.103
Also according to the Nuzi
texts, if a wife is barren,

00:05:42.103 --> 00:05:45.673
she is to provide a maidservant
as a substitute to bear her

00:05:45.673 --> 00:05:47.089
husband's children.
 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:50.191
And this is something that
happens with three out of the

00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:52.334
four matriarchs,
who are afflicted with

00:05:52.334 --> 00:05:54.589
infertility: Sarah,
Rachel and Leah.

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:58.241
There are other parallels in
family and marriage law that

00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:00.980
correlate with certain biblical
details.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.129
In the eighteenth century,
the texts from Mari.

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.383
They contain names that
correspond to Israelite names:

00:06:08.383 --> 00:06:10.550
Benjamin, Laban,
Ishmael.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.008
So biblical scholars,
buoyed up by these correlations

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:18.009
between the archaeological
finds,

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:20.072
the texts found by
archaeologists,

00:06:20.072 --> 00:06:23.134
and biblical stories,
asserted that the patriarchs

00:06:23.134 --> 00:06:26.258
were real persons and their
customs and their legal

00:06:26.258 --> 00:06:29.758
practices and their social
institutions could be verified

00:06:29.758 --> 00:06:33.445
against the backdrop of the
second millennium as revealed by

00:06:33.445 --> 00:06:35.569
archaeological findings.
 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:39.711
However, it's been argued that
some of these ancient sources

00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:43.221
have been misread or
misinterpreted in an effort to

00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:46.449
find parallels with biblical
institutions.

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.811
A lot of gap-filling is going
on to make these texts look as

00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:52.660
though they correspond to
biblical institutions.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.959
And skeptics like Thomas
Thompson and John Van Seters

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:59.258
point out that many of the
biblical customs which are

00:06:59.258 --> 00:07:02.938
paralleled in Ancient Near
Eastern sources were still alive

00:07:02.938 --> 00:07:05.730
and well down in the first
millennium.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.148
So reference to these customs
in the patriarchal stories

00:07:09.148 --> 00:07:12.069
really doesn't tell us anything
about dating.

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:14.800
They could derive from anywhere
in the second or first

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.688
millennium.
And for other reasons,

00:07:16.688 --> 00:07:19.347
they think it is much more
reasonable to date the

00:07:19.347 --> 00:07:22.449
composition of these stories to
the first millennium,

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.970
in some cases,
quite late first millennium.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.109
Furthermore,
over time, many discrepancies

00:07:28.109 --> 00:07:32.704
between the archeological record
and the biblical text became

00:07:32.704 --> 00:07:34.809
apparent.
Increasingly,

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:39.330
practitioners of what was now
being termed Palestinian

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.832
archaeology,
or Ancient Near Eastern

00:07:41.832 --> 00:07:45.126
archaeology, or archaeology of
the Levant, rather than biblical

00:07:45.126 --> 00:07:47.518
archaeology--some of these
archaeologists grew

00:07:47.518 --> 00:07:50.547
disinterested in pointing out
the correlations between the

00:07:50.547 --> 00:07:53.682
archaeological data and the
biblical stories or in trying to

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.817
explain away any discrepancies
in order to keep the biblical

00:07:56.817 --> 00:07:59.895
text intact.
They began to focus on the best

00:07:59.895 --> 00:08:03.368
possible reconstruction of the
history of the region on the

00:08:03.368 --> 00:08:06.780
basis of the archaeological
evidence regardless of whether

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.893
or not those results would
confirm the biblical text,

00:08:09.893 --> 00:08:11.569
the biblical account.
 

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:15.352
In fact, this reconstruction
often does contradict biblical

00:08:15.352 --> 00:08:17.476
claims.
We're going to see this quite

00:08:17.476 --> 00:08:20.707
clearly in a few weeks when we
consider the book of Joshua and

00:08:20.707 --> 00:08:24.149
its story of Israel's lighting
invasion of the land of Canaan.

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:28.300
The archaeological record just
doesn't support such a story.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.821
Still, many people have clung
to the idea of the Bible as a

00:08:32.821 --> 00:08:37.498
historically accurate document,
many times out of ideological

00:08:37.498 --> 00:08:39.957
necessity.
Many fear that if the

00:08:39.957 --> 00:08:42.951
historical information in the
Bible isn't true,

00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:46.336
then the Bible is unreliable as
a source of religious

00:08:46.336 --> 00:08:48.419
instruction or inspiration.
 

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:50.759
And that's something they don't
want to give up.

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:55.269
This is all really a very
unfortunate and heavy burden to

00:08:55.269 --> 00:09:00.182
place on this fascinating little
library of writings from late

00:09:00.182 --> 00:09:03.244
antiquity.
People who equate truth with

00:09:03.244 --> 00:09:06.974
historical fact will certainly
end up viewing the Bible

00:09:06.974 --> 00:09:10.135
dismissively,
as a naive and unsophisticated

00:09:10.135 --> 00:09:14.246
web of lies, since it is replete
with elements that cannot be

00:09:14.246 --> 00:09:18.175
literally true.
But to view it this way is to

00:09:18.175 --> 00:09:20.220
make a genre mistake.
 

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.247
Shakespeare's Hamlet,
while set in Denmark,

00:09:24.247 --> 00:09:27.700
an actual place,
is not historical fact.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.303
But that doesn't make it a
naive and unsophisticated web of

00:09:31.303 --> 00:09:35.217
lies, because we accept when we
read or watch Hamlet that

00:09:35.217 --> 00:09:37.640
it is not a work of
historiography,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.790
a work of writing about history.
 

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.860
It is a work of literature.
 

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.142
And in deference to that genre
and its conventions,

00:09:45.142 --> 00:09:48.950
we know and accept that the
truths it conveys are not those

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.600
of historical fact,
but are social,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.639
political, ethical,
existential truths.

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:59.206
And the Bible deserves at least
the same courteous attention to

00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:01.783
its genre.
The Bible doesn't pretend to be

00:10:01.783 --> 00:10:04.843
and it shouldn't be read as what
we would call "objective

00:10:04.843 --> 00:10:06.919
history"--and see the scare
quotes,

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:10.103
you should be looking up here
so you'll see the scare quotes:

00:10:10.103 --> 00:10:12.385
"objective history"--in other
words perhaps,

00:10:12.385 --> 00:10:14.029
a bare narration of events.
 

00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:17.107
To be sure, we do find that
some events that are mentioned

00:10:17.107 --> 00:10:20.400
in the biblical texts correlate
to events that we know of from

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.019
sources outside the Bible.
 

00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:25.288
So for example,
Pharaoh Shishak's invasion of

00:10:25.288 --> 00:10:26.700
Palestine in 924.
 

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.621
This is mentioned in the
biblical text,

00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:31.301
it's mentioned in the Egyptian
sources--there's a nice

00:10:31.301 --> 00:10:34.386
correlation.
The destruction of the northern

00:10:34.386 --> 00:10:38.205
kingdom of Israel in 722,
the capture of Jerusalem in

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:40.344
597,
the destruction of the temple

00:10:40.344 --> 00:10:43.594
in Jerusalem in 586--these are
all recorded in the biblical

00:10:43.594 --> 00:10:47.179
text and they are in Assyrian
and Babylonian records as well;

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:50.330
as well as other events from
the period of the monarchy.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.172
So as a result,
because of these correlations,

00:10:53.172 --> 00:10:56.646
many scholars are willing to
accept the general biblical

00:10:56.646 --> 00:10:59.488
chronology of the period from
the monarchy on:

00:10:59.488 --> 00:11:02.580
starting about 1000 on,
they accept that general

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.664
chronology;
the sequence of kings and

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.769
battles and so on.
 

00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:07.663
But ultimately,
it is a mistake,

00:11:07.663 --> 00:11:10.840
I think, to read the Bible as a
historical record.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.129
The Bible is literature.
 

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:16.390
Its composition is influenced
and determined by literary

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.250
conventions and goals.
 

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:23.919
Now, of course we all know that
there is no such thing as purely

00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:26.350
objective history anyway.
 

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.990
We have no direct access to
past events.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.146
We only ever have mediated
access in material:

00:11:33.146 --> 00:11:37.004
archaeological remains that
yield information to us only

00:11:37.004 --> 00:11:39.669
after a process of
interpretation,

00:11:39.669 --> 00:11:43.204
or in texts that are themselves
already an interpretation of

00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:45.899
events and must still be
interpreted by us.

00:11:45.899 --> 00:11:50.209
The biblical narrative is an
interpretation of events that

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:54.518
were held by centuries' long
tradition to be meaningful in

00:11:54.518 --> 00:11:56.559
the life of the people.
 

00:11:56.559 --> 00:12:00.904
And to the biblical narrators,
these events known perhaps from

00:12:00.904 --> 00:12:04.750
ancient oral traditions pointed
to a divine purpose.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.174
The narrative is told to
illustrate that basic

00:12:08.174 --> 00:12:11.342
proposition.
The biblical narrators are not

00:12:11.342 --> 00:12:15.338
trying to write history as a
modern historian might try to

00:12:15.338 --> 00:12:18.212
write history.
They're concerned to show us

00:12:18.212 --> 00:12:21.756
what they believed to be the
finger of God in the events and

00:12:21.756 --> 00:12:24.100
experiences of the Israelite
people.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.865
One scholar,
Marc Brettler,

00:12:25.865 --> 00:12:29.735
whose name I've also put up
here, Marc Brettler notes that

00:12:29.735 --> 00:12:32.846
in the Bible,
the past is refracted through a

00:12:32.846 --> 00:12:35.624
theological lens if not a
partisan political,

00:12:35.624 --> 00:12:36.950
ideological lens .
 

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.173
But then all ancient historical
narrative is written that way,

00:12:40.173 --> 00:12:42.603
and one could argue all
contemporary historical

00:12:42.603 --> 00:12:44.399
narrative is written that way.
 

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:47.277
With due caution,
we can still learn things from

00:12:47.277 --> 00:12:48.929
texts ancient and modern.
 

00:12:48.929 --> 00:12:51.632
We can still learn things about
Israel's history from the

00:12:51.632 --> 00:12:53.804
biblical sources,
just as classical historians

00:12:53.804 --> 00:12:56.409
have learned a great deal about
classical history,

00:12:56.409 --> 00:12:59.307
Greece and Rome,
despite or through the

00:12:59.307 --> 00:13:03.653
tendentious, partisan and
ideologically motivated writings

00:13:03.653 --> 00:13:05.559
of classical writers.
 

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:08.585
So our discussion of the
patriarchal stories is going to

00:13:08.585 --> 00:13:10.950
bear all of these considerations
in mind.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.884
We're not going to be asking
whether these stories are

00:13:12.884 --> 00:13:13.759
historically accurate.
 

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:16.179
I'm going to assume they are
not.

00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:19.509
And once we rid ourselves of
the burden of historicity,

00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:22.838
we're free to appreciate the
stories for what they are:

00:13:22.838 --> 00:13:25.359
powerful,
powerful narratives that must

00:13:25.359 --> 00:13:28.679
be read against the literary
conventions of their time,

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:32.837
and whose truths are social,
political, moral and

00:13:32.837 --> 00:13:36.600
existential.
So what are these truths?

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.109
We'll begin to answer this
question--begin to answer

00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:40.970
this question,
you'll spend the rest of your

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.480
life finishing the process of
answering this question.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.705
But we'll begin by identifying
some, by no means all,

00:13:46.705 --> 00:13:49.620
of the major themes of Genesis
12 through 50.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.275
And we're going to begin with
the story of Terah and his

00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:54.700
family.
This is a story that's marked

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.269
by the themes of divine command
and divine promise.

00:13:58.269 --> 00:14:01.544
Now, the biblical writer
represents the emigration of

00:14:01.544 --> 00:14:04.504
Terah's son Abram,
whose name will be changed to

00:14:04.504 --> 00:14:06.860
Abraham,
so sometimes I'll say one and

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.019
sometimes the other.
 

00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:11.059
But they represent this
emigration as divinely

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:13.195
commanded.
It's the first step in a

00:14:13.195 --> 00:14:16.177
journey that will lead
ultimately to the formation of a

00:14:16.177 --> 00:14:17.889
nation in covenant with God.
 

00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:19.779
First we meet our cast of
characters.

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:26.049
This is in Genesis 11:27 on
through chapter 12:3.

00:14:26.049 --> 00:14:29.017
Now these are the
generations of Terah:

00:14:29.017 --> 00:14:31.580
Terah begot Abram,
Nahor, and Haran;

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.629
and Haran begot Lot.
 

00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:36.515
Haran died in the lifetime of
his father Terah,

00:14:36.515 --> 00:14:39.149
in his native land,
Ur of the Chaldeans.

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:43.135
And Abram and Nahor took them
wives, the name of Abram's wife

00:14:43.135 --> 00:14:45.659
being Sarai [who will become
Sarah];

00:14:45.659 --> 00:14:47.960
and the name of Nahor's wife,
Milcah....

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.690
And Sarai was barren;
she had no child.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.597
Terah took Abram his son,
and Lot the son of Haran,

00:14:53.597 --> 00:14:56.156
his grandson,
and Sarai, his daughter in law,

00:14:56.156 --> 00:14:58.953
his son Abram's wife;
[getting confused yet?]

00:14:58.953 --> 00:15:02.342
and they went forth together
from Ur of the Chaldeans to go

00:15:02.342 --> 00:15:05.139
into the land of Canaan;
but when they came to Haran,

00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:06.009
they settled there.
 

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:10.240
And the days of Terah were 205
years: then Terah died in Haran.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.637
Now the Lord said to Abram,
"Go from your country and your

00:15:13.637 --> 00:15:16.975
kindred, and your father's
house, to the land that I will

00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:19.201
show you."
I will make of you a great

00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:20.720
nation,
And I will bless you;

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.720
And make your name great
So that you will be a blessing.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.228
I will bless those who bless
you, and him who curses you,

00:15:26.228 --> 00:15:28.593
I will curse;
and by you all the families of

00:15:28.593 --> 00:15:31.809
the earth shall bless themselves
[source unknown].

00:15:31.809 --> 00:15:35.971
So Abram is commanded to go
forth from his home and family

00:15:35.971 --> 00:15:40.571
to a location to be named later,
a location that remains for now

00:15:40.571 --> 00:15:43.154
unspecified.
And this is a fact that has

00:15:43.154 --> 00:15:45.878
caused commentators for
centuries to praise Abram for

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.199
his faith.
That is a virtue--faith is a

00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:51.713
virtue--that is connected or
associated with Abram/Abraham in

00:15:51.713 --> 00:15:55.519
other biblical contexts and also
in later religious tradition.

00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:59.454
He is seen as the paradigm,
the paradigmatic exemplar of a

00:15:59.454 --> 00:16:01.984
man of faith.
The command is coupled with a

00:16:01.984 --> 00:16:04.871
promise: "I will make of you,"
God says, "a great nation,

00:16:04.871 --> 00:16:06.159
and I will bless you."
 

00:16:06.159 --> 00:16:10.250
But, we have just learned in
chapter 11 that Sarai is barren.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:15.094
It was a seemingly irrelevant
detail, whose import is suddenly

00:16:15.094 --> 00:16:18.080
clear.
How clever of the narrator to

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.105
plant the information we need to
realize that Abram has to take

00:16:23.105 --> 00:16:26.785
God's word on faith,
and how perfectly the narrator

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:30.354
sets up the dramatic tension and
the great confusion that is

00:16:30.354 --> 00:16:33.379
going to run through the next
several chapters,

00:16:33.379 --> 00:16:37.101
because Abram doesn't seem to
understand that the progeny will

00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:39.305
come from Sarai.
You have to read these stories

00:16:39.305 --> 00:16:41.000
as if you're reading them for
the first time.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.230
You have the great disadvantage
of knowing the ending.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.320
It's a terrible disadvantage.
 

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.118
You have to discipline yourself
to read these stories as if you

00:16:48.118 --> 00:16:50.872
don't know what's coming next
and put yourself in the position

00:16:50.872 --> 00:16:51.820
of the character.
 

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.295
Abram's just been told he's
going to be the father of great

00:16:54.295 --> 00:16:55.790
nations and he has a barren
wife.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.610
 
 

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.644
He doesn't seem to understand
that the progeny is going to

00:17:02.644 --> 00:17:05.147
come from Sarai,
and why should he think that it

00:17:05.147 --> 00:17:06.930
would?
God wasn't specific.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.998
He simply says,
"I shall make of you a great

00:17:08.998 --> 00:17:10.715
nation."
He says nothing of Sarai,

00:17:10.715 --> 00:17:12.099
and after all she's barren.
 

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:15.469
So Abram may be forgiven for
thinking that perhaps some other

00:17:15.469 --> 00:17:18.474
mate awaits him.
And so he surrenders her easily

00:17:18.474 --> 00:17:21.305
to other men,
to Pharaoh of Egypt immediately

00:17:21.305 --> 00:17:23.750
following this scene in chapter
11;

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.150
immediately after that,
in Egypt, he surrenders her.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.514
He willingly accepts Sarai's
offer of a handmaid,

00:17:29.514 --> 00:17:33.089
Hagar, to bear a child Ishmael,
in Sarai's place.

00:17:33.089 --> 00:17:37.007
How cleverly the narrator leads
us with Abram to pin our hopes

00:17:37.007 --> 00:17:39.640
on Ishmael as the child of the
promise.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.634
And how cleverly is the carpet
pulled out from under our feet

00:17:43.634 --> 00:17:45.808
in Genesis 17,
when God finally,

00:17:45.808 --> 00:17:48.156
perhaps impatiently,
talks specifics:

00:17:48.156 --> 00:17:51.742
No, I meant that you would
father a great nation through

00:17:51.742 --> 00:17:53.283
Sarah.
And Abraham,

00:17:53.283 --> 00:17:55.616
as he's now called,
is incredulous:

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:58.430
"She's past the age of bearing,
Lord."

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:02.180
And he laughs.
And God is silent.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.703
And in that silence I always
imagine that this light goes on:

00:18:05.703 --> 00:18:08.170
this click, this awful,
sickening light.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.319
And Abraham says,
O, that Ishmael might live in

00:18:11.319 --> 00:18:13.290
your sight!
Or something like that.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.380
I think I probably misquoted.
 

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.722
"O, that Ishmael might live by
your favor"-- sorry,

00:18:16.722 --> 00:18:17.940
that's the actual words.
 

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.500
But God is determined.
 

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.602
Sarah will bear Isaac and with
him God will make an everlasting

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:26.240
covenant.
All of this drama through the

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.335
first five chapters made
possible by a seemingly

00:18:29.335 --> 00:18:32.901
irrelevant line in 11:30,
a sort of throw-away datum in a

00:18:32.901 --> 00:18:36.233
family list that one might gloss
over: "and Sarai was barren;

00:18:36.233 --> 00:18:37.400
she had no child."
 

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.200
And that's the power and beauty
of biblical narrative.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.430
You have to get yourself into
the mindset to read it that way.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.728
A few verses later,
when Abram and his wife Sarai

00:18:47.728 --> 00:18:51.646
and his nephew Lot and those
traveling with them all reach

00:18:51.646 --> 00:18:54.670
Canaan, God makes an additional
promise.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.458
He says in verse 7,
"I will assign this land to

00:18:57.458 --> 00:18:59.822
your offspring."
So in just a few short

00:18:59.822 --> 00:19:03.291
verses--we've just gone from 12,
we've just gone seven verses

00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:06.240
now into chapter 12--in just a
few short verses,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.225
the writer has established the
three-fold promise that

00:19:09.225 --> 00:19:12.098
underpins the biblical drama
that's about to unfold:

00:19:12.098 --> 00:19:16.279
the promise of progeny,
of blessing, and of land.

00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:19.458
And that establishes a
narrative tension for the

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:23.177
stories of the patriarchs,
but also for the story of the

00:19:23.177 --> 00:19:25.950
nation of Israel in subsequent
books.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.824
Because in the patriarchal
stories, there is this

00:19:28.824 --> 00:19:32.177
suspenseful vacillation between
episodes that threaten to

00:19:32.177 --> 00:19:35.890
extinguish God's promises and
episodes that reaffirm them.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:40.980
Israelite matriarchs seem to be
a singularly infertile group.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.392
The lines of inheritance defy
our expectations:

00:19:43.392 --> 00:19:46.433
it doesn't seem to go to the
person that we think that it's

00:19:46.433 --> 00:19:48.951
going to go to.
The process by which the

00:19:48.951 --> 00:19:52.500
promise is fulfilled is halting
and torturous at times.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.956
We're going to look at one
example of an episode in which

00:19:56.956 --> 00:20:00.140
the promise is affirmed--or
confirmed,

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.444
reaffirmed--and an example of
an episode in which the promise

00:20:04.444 --> 00:20:06.309
is supremely threatened.
 

00:20:06.309 --> 00:20:10.415
In Genesis 15,
God's promise to Abraham is

00:20:10.415 --> 00:20:13.819
formalized in a ritual ceremony.
 

00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:16.800
God and Abraham are said to
"cut" a covenant--that's the

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.888
verb that's used in making a
covenant--and "covenant" is a

00:20:19.888 --> 00:20:21.460
central biblical concept.
 

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.276
The Hebrew word for covenant,
which I've written over here is

00:20:24.276 --> 00:20:26.343
berit.
It means vow,

00:20:26.343 --> 00:20:31.170
promise, perhaps contract,
agreement or pact.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.579
Parallels to the biblical
covenant have been pointed out

00:20:34.579 --> 00:20:37.990
by many Ancient Near Eastern
historians and scholars.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.750
We have in our Ancient Near
Eastern texts--and we'll come

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.707
back to these in more detail
when we get into Exodus--we have

00:20:43.707 --> 00:20:45.579
in our Ancient Near Eastern
texts,

00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:49.022
two types, two main types of
covenant: the suzerainty

00:20:49.022 --> 00:20:51.339
covenant and the parity
covenant.

00:20:51.339 --> 00:20:54.382
As you can imagine from the
name, a suzerainty covenant is a

00:20:54.382 --> 00:20:56.289
covenant in which a superior
party,

00:20:56.289 --> 00:21:01.228
a suzerain, dictates the terms
of a political treaty usually,

00:21:01.228 --> 00:21:04.109
and an inferior party obeys
them.

00:21:04.109 --> 00:21:07.716
The arrangement primarily
serves the interest of the

00:21:07.716 --> 00:21:10.970
suzerain, and not the vassal or
the subject.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.998
In a parity covenant,
you have really two equal

00:21:13.998 --> 00:21:17.619
parties who both agree to
observe the provisions of some

00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:20.499
kind of treaty.
Now, there are four major

00:21:20.499 --> 00:21:22.519
covenants in the Hebrew Bible.
 

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:27.135
They're initiated by Yahweh as
expressions of divine favor and

00:21:27.135 --> 00:21:29.666
graciousness.
And two of these appear in

00:21:29.666 --> 00:21:31.356
Genesis.
We've already seen one,

00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:34.321
the Noahide covenant;
and the Abrahamic covenant,

00:21:34.321 --> 00:21:36.200
which we're looking at now.
 

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:41.797
Now, the Noahide covenant in
Genesis 9:1-17 is universal in

00:21:41.797 --> 00:21:44.626
scope.
It encompasses all life on

00:21:44.626 --> 00:21:47.113
earth.
It stresses the sanctity of

00:21:47.113 --> 00:21:51.051
life and in this covenant,
God promises never to destroy

00:21:51.051 --> 00:21:53.242
all life again.
By contrast,

00:21:53.242 --> 00:21:56.927
the Abrahamic covenant is a
covenant with a single

00:21:56.927 --> 00:21:59.513
individual.
So we've gone from a covenant

00:21:59.513 --> 00:22:01.999
with all of humanity to a
covenant with a single

00:22:01.999 --> 00:22:04.631
individual.
And it looks very much like an

00:22:04.631 --> 00:22:07.280
Ancient Near Eastern suzerainty
covenant.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.890
God appears as a suzerain.
 

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.282
He's making a land grant to a
favored subject,

00:22:11.282 --> 00:22:13.250
which is very often how these
work.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:17.400
And there's an ancient ritual
that ratifies the oath.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.080
In general, in this kind of
covenant, the parties to the

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.894
oath would pass between the
split carcass of a sacrificial

00:22:24.894 --> 00:22:28.909
animal as if to say that they
agree they will suffer the same

00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:32.589
fate as this animal if they
violate the covenant.

00:22:32.589 --> 00:22:35.559
In Genesis 15,
Abraham cuts sacrificial

00:22:35.559 --> 00:22:38.372
animals in two and God,
but only God,

00:22:38.372 --> 00:22:41.029
passes between the two halves.
 

00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:45.402
The striking thing about the
Abrahamic covenant is its

00:22:45.402 --> 00:22:47.299
unilateral character.
 

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:50.630
Only God seems to be obligated
by the covenant,

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.250
obligated to fulfill the
promise that he's made.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.900
Abraham doesn't appear to have
any obligation in return.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.249
And so in this case,
it is the subject,

00:23:00.249 --> 00:23:03.896
Abraham, and not the suzerain,
God, who is benefited by this

00:23:03.896 --> 00:23:07.183
covenant,
and that's a complete reversal

00:23:07.183 --> 00:23:08.839
of our expectation.
 

00:23:08.839 --> 00:23:12.690
Note also that the biblical
writer goes out of his way to

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.403
provide a moral justification
for this grant of land to

00:23:16.403 --> 00:23:19.265
Israel.
In the biblical writer's view,

00:23:19.265 --> 00:23:23.336
God is the owner of the land,
and so he is empowered to set

00:23:23.336 --> 00:23:27.196
conditions or residency
requirements for those who would

00:23:27.196 --> 00:23:29.839
reside in it,
like a landlord.

00:23:29.839 --> 00:23:32.926
The current inhabitants of the
land are polluting it,

00:23:32.926 --> 00:23:35.359
filling it with bloodshed and
idolatry.

00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:39.120
And when the land becomes so
polluted, completely polluted,

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.390
it will spew out its
inhabitants.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.000
That process,
God says, isn't complete;

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.410
so Israel is going to have to
wait.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.968
The lease isn't up yet,
and the Israelites will have to

00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:50.001
wait.
He says in Genesis 15:16,

00:23:50.001 --> 00:23:53.745
the iniquity of the Amorites
will not be fulfilled until

00:23:53.745 --> 00:23:56.475
then.
So here, and in other places in

00:23:56.475 --> 00:24:00.917
the Bible, it's clear that God's
covenant with Israel is not due

00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:04.583
to any special merit of the
Israelites or favoritism:

00:24:04.583 --> 00:24:08.319
this is actually said
explicitly in Deuteronomy.

00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:11.344
Rather, God is seeking
replacement tenants who are

00:24:11.344 --> 00:24:14.739
going to follow the moral rules
of residence that he has

00:24:14.739 --> 00:24:16.529
established for his land.
 

00:24:16.529 --> 00:24:20.819
Genesis 17 seems to be a second
version of the same covenant.

00:24:20.819 --> 00:24:24.435
This time, scholars attribute
it to P--the Priestly writer,

00:24:24.435 --> 00:24:26.447
the P source.
There are some notable

00:24:26.447 --> 00:24:29.239
differences, emphasizing themes
that were important to the

00:24:29.239 --> 00:24:32.408
Priestly writer.
God adds to the promises in

00:24:32.408 --> 00:24:37.549
Genesis 17 that a line of kings
will come forth from Abraham,

00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:41.474
and then, that Abraham and his
male descendents be circumcised

00:24:41.474 --> 00:24:43.920
as a perpetual sign of the
covenant.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.690
So here there is some
obligation for Abraham.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:50.102
"Thus shall my covenant be
marked in your flesh as an

00:24:50.102 --> 00:24:51.480
everlasting pact" .
 

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.134
Failure to circumcise is
tantamount to breaking the

00:24:54.134 --> 00:24:55.940
covenant, according to the text.
 

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.599
Now, circumcision is known in
many of the cultures of the

00:24:58.599 --> 00:24:59.549
Ancient Near East.
 

00:24:59.549 --> 00:25:02.314
It's generally a rite of
passage that was performed at

00:25:02.314 --> 00:25:05.496
the time of puberty rather than
a ritual that was performed at

00:25:05.496 --> 00:25:07.269
birth, eight days after birth.
 

00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:10.568
So that's unusual in the
Israelite context to have it

00:25:10.568 --> 00:25:11.900
occur with infants.
 

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:16.014
But as is the case with so many
biblical rituals or institutions

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:20.064
or laws, whatever their original
meaning or significance in the

00:25:20.064 --> 00:25:22.888
ancient world,
whether this was originally a

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:25.559
puberty rite or a fertility rite
of some kind,

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:30.890
the ritual has been suffused
with a new meaning in our texts.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:34.517
So circumcision is here infused
with a new meaning:

00:25:34.517 --> 00:25:38.506
it becomes a sign of God's
eternal covenant with Abraham

00:25:38.506 --> 00:25:41.295
and his seed.
These texts are typical of

00:25:41.295 --> 00:25:43.150
affirmations of God's promise.
 

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.694
But despite them,
the patriarchal episodes or

00:25:45.694 --> 00:25:48.354
stories are peppered with
episodes in which the

00:25:48.354 --> 00:25:51.940
realization of the promise and
the blessing is threatened.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.619
In chapter 12,
Abram surrenders his wife Sarai

00:25:54.619 --> 00:25:57.716
to Pharaoh in order to advance
his position among the

00:25:57.716 --> 00:26:00.231
Egyptians,
plausibly not knowing that it

00:26:00.231 --> 00:26:03.769
is Sarai who is supposed to bear
the child of God's promise.

00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:06.331
As I said, that's left unclear
until chapter 17,

00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:08.729
when God says:
No, no, no, you misunderstood.

00:26:08.729 --> 00:26:10.976
I meant Sarai.
God intervenes,

00:26:10.976 --> 00:26:14.269
however, and returns Sarai to
Abraham.

00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:17.936
Sarai's barren state really
casts a shadow over the promise

00:26:17.936 --> 00:26:21.730
from the very beginning of the
story of Abraham and Sarah.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.891
Desperate, Sarah takes
advantage of the custom that is

00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:28.710
attested in the ancient world of
giving her Egyptian handmaid,

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.210
Hagar, to Abraham to bear a
child in her stead.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.591
But Hagar apparently lords this
over her mistress,

00:26:35.591 --> 00:26:39.180
and an embittered Sarah forces
her from the house.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:43.038
Hagar and her child Ishmael cry
out to God in the wilderness and

00:26:43.038 --> 00:26:46.670
God assures Hagar that Ishmael,
who's regarded by Muslims as

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:50.007
the ancestor of the Arabs and
the inheritor of the blessing

00:26:50.007 --> 00:26:53.044
and the promise,
that Ishmael shall become a

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:54.339
great nation too.
 

00:26:54.339 --> 00:26:58.955
But really the greatest threat
to the promise comes from God

00:26:58.955 --> 00:27:03.728
himself, and that is in Genesis
22 when God tests Abraham with

00:27:03.728 --> 00:27:06.309
the most horrible of demands.
 

00:27:06.309 --> 00:27:08.894
The child of the promise,
Isaac, who was born

00:27:08.894 --> 00:27:12.420
miraculously to Sarah when she
was no longer of child-bearing

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.630
age,
is to be sacrificed to God by

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.519
Abraham's own hand.
 

00:27:17.519 --> 00:27:21.016
And the story of the binding of
Isaac is one of the most

00:27:21.016 --> 00:27:24.829
powerful, most riveting stories
not only in the Bible but,

00:27:24.829 --> 00:27:27.730
some have claimed,
in all of world literature.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:31.969
The story is a marvelous
exemplar of the biblical

00:27:31.969 --> 00:27:35.589
narrator's literary skill and
artistry.

00:27:35.589 --> 00:27:38.297
This week's assigned reading
includes selections from Robert

00:27:38.297 --> 00:27:39.903
Alter's book,
The Art of Biblical

00:27:39.903 --> 00:27:42.680
Narrative,
which I heartily recommend to

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.160
read in its entirety.
 

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.711
Alter describes the extreme
economy of biblical narrative,

00:27:47.711 --> 00:27:51.449
economy in the description of
physical settings and character

00:27:51.449 --> 00:27:52.819
as well as speech.
 

00:27:52.819 --> 00:27:56.355
Rarely does the narrator
comment on or explain a

00:27:56.355 --> 00:27:59.740
character's actions or thoughts
or motives.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.740
There's only the barest minimum
of dialogue.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.773
And on the few occasions that
the Bible will violate this

00:28:05.773 --> 00:28:08.861
principle of verbal economy--for
example if two characters

00:28:08.861 --> 00:28:11.950
converse at length--you can be
sure it's significant.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.789
You'll want to pay extra
attention.

00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:17.729
The biblical narrator's
concealing of details and the

00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:21.875
motives of the characters,
God and Abraham and Isaac,

00:28:21.875 --> 00:28:25.460
leads to ambiguity,
and the possibility of very

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.329
many interpretations.
 

00:28:27.329 --> 00:28:30.491
And that is a striking
characteristic of biblical

00:28:30.491 --> 00:28:33.324
prose: its suppression of
detail, its terse,

00:28:33.324 --> 00:28:36.069
laconic style.
That makes the little that

00:28:36.069 --> 00:28:39.609
is given so powerful,
so "fraught with background" to

00:28:39.609 --> 00:28:43.843
use the phrase of Eric Auerbach,
whose article you are also to

00:28:43.843 --> 00:28:47.187
read this week.
Auerbach contrasts the literary

00:28:47.187 --> 00:28:51.523
style of Homer with the biblical
writer's style specifically in

00:28:51.523 --> 00:28:54.529
connection with the story of
Genesis 22.

00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:58.426
The ambiguities and the
indeterminacy of this story make

00:28:58.426 --> 00:29:02.040
it one of the most interpreted
texts of all time.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.700
Why is God testing Abraham?
 

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.970
Does God really desire such a
sacrifice?

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:12.147
What is Abraham thinking and
feeling as he walks--for three

00:29:12.147 --> 00:29:16.325
days, already--walks with his
son, bearing the wood and the

00:29:16.325 --> 00:29:18.269
fire for the sacrifice?
 

00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:20.879
Does he fully intend to obey
this command,

00:29:20.879 --> 00:29:24.190
to annul the covenantal promise
with his own hand?

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.360
Or does he trust in God to
intervene?

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.269
Or is this a paradox of faith?
 

00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:31.821
Does Abraham intend faithfully
to obey, all the while trusting

00:29:31.821 --> 00:29:35.490
faithfully that God's promise
will nevertheless be fulfilled?

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.230
What's Isaac thinking?
 

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.110
Does he understand what is
happening?

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.779
How old is he?
Is this a little boy or a grown

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:43.970
man?
Is he prepared to obey?

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:47.260
He sees the wood and the
firestone in his father's hand.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.619
Clearly a sacrifice is planned.
 

00:29:48.619 --> 00:29:50.799
He's got three days to figure
that out.

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:53.158
He asks his father:
Where is the sheep for the

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:55.964
burnt offering?
Does he know the answer even as

00:29:55.964 --> 00:29:58.000
he asks?
Does he hear the double

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.539
entendre in his father's very
simple and solemn reply,

00:30:01.539 --> 00:30:04.867
which in the unpunctuated
Hebrew might be read,

00:30:04.867 --> 00:30:08.411
"The lord will provide the
sheep for the offering:

00:30:08.411 --> 00:30:10.745
my son."
Does he struggle when he's

00:30:10.745 --> 00:30:13.130
bound?
Does he acquiesce?

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:17.160
The beauty of the narrative is
its sheer economy.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.017
It offers so little that we as
readers are forced to imagine

00:30:21.017 --> 00:30:23.109
the innumerable possibilities.
 

00:30:23.109 --> 00:30:25.210
We play out the drama in
countless ways,

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.549
with an Abraham who's reluctant
and an Isaac who's ignorant.

00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:31.982
Or an Abraham who's eager to
serve his God to the point of

00:30:31.982 --> 00:30:34.993
sacrificing his own son,
and an Isaac who willingly

00:30:34.993 --> 00:30:36.920
bares his neck to the knife.
 

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.059
Read the story one verse,
one phrase, one word at a time.

00:30:40.059 --> 00:30:43.727
There are so few words that you
can be sure that they were

00:30:43.727 --> 00:30:44.950
chosen with care.
 

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:47.991
You'll be looking at Genesis 22
closely in your section

00:30:47.991 --> 00:30:50.430
discussions.
And as you read the story,

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:54.048
remember its larger context:
God's promise to make Abraham

00:30:54.048 --> 00:30:56.841
the father of a great people
through his son,

00:30:56.841 --> 00:30:59.242
Isaac.
It's this context,

00:30:59.242 --> 00:31:02.741
this promise,
that gives the story its

00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:05.390
special power and pathos.
 

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:08.914
But of course the story can be
contextualized in a number of

00:31:08.914 --> 00:31:10.643
different ways.
For example,

00:31:10.643 --> 00:31:13.971
one can read the story in its
historical context of child

00:31:13.971 --> 00:31:16.230
sacrifice in the Ancient Near
East.

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:20.499
Although child sacrifice was
adamantly condemned in various

00:31:20.499 --> 00:31:24.296
later layers of the Bible,
there's plenty of evidence that

00:31:24.296 --> 00:31:27.489
it was probably practiced in
different quarters throughout

00:31:27.489 --> 00:31:29.170
the period of the monarchy.
 

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:33.695
Does Genesis 22 assume or
reject the practice of child

00:31:33.695 --> 00:31:36.928
sacrifice?
Some scholars argue that a core

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:41.273
story promoting child sacrifice
has been edited so as to serve

00:31:41.273 --> 00:31:45.690
as a polemic against child
sacrifice now in its final form.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.063
Do you think so?
Can you see the seams and feel

00:31:48.063 --> 00:31:50.869
the narrative tensions that
would support such a claim?

00:31:50.869 --> 00:31:54.440
Does the story pull in more
than one direction?

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.309
Or we can read the story in its
immediate literary context.

00:31:58.309 --> 00:32:02.414
Abraham has just permitted the
expulsion of Ishmael,

00:32:02.414 --> 00:32:04.990
the only beloved son of Hagar.
 

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:09.230
And now God demands that he
sacrifice his beloved son.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.150
What might he be trying to
teach Abraham?

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:15.613
Is this a trial in the sense of
a test or a trial in the sense

00:32:15.613 --> 00:32:19.020
of a punishment?
The Hebrew term can tolerate

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.785
both meanings.
Or Genesis 22 can be

00:32:21.785 --> 00:32:24.089
contextualized another way.
 

00:32:24.089 --> 00:32:25.964
And at this point,
we need to backtrack a little

00:32:25.964 --> 00:32:27.599
bit to the story of Sodom and
Gomorrah,

00:32:27.599 --> 00:32:33.045
which is in Genesis 18 and 19,
to contextualize the story a

00:32:33.045 --> 00:32:38.490
little bit, in terms of
Abraham's character development.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:42.631
In the story of Sodom and
Gomorrah, in Genesis 18 and 19,

00:32:42.631 --> 00:32:46.847
Yahweh tells Abraham of his
plan to investigate reports of

00:32:46.847 --> 00:32:51.095
the wickedness of the city,
the Canaanite city of

00:32:51.095 --> 00:32:55.657
Sodom--its violence,
its cruelty to strangers--and

00:32:55.657 --> 00:32:59.321
to destroy it.
And Abraham's reaction comes as

00:32:59.321 --> 00:33:01.000
something of a surprise.
 

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.178
He objects to the plan,
and he starts to argue with

00:33:04.178 --> 00:33:05.777
God.
"Will you sweep away the

00:33:05.777 --> 00:33:07.400
innocent along with the guilty?
 

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.200
Shall not the judge of all the
earth deal justly?"

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.319
That's in Genesis 18:23-25.
 

00:33:12.319 --> 00:33:14.940
The question is of course
rhetorical.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.844
Abraham is evidently quite
confident that God would not act

00:33:18.844 --> 00:33:23.220
unjustly, would not destroy the
innocent along with the wicked.

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.450
Indeed, Abraham is banking on
the fact that God is merciful

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:29.960
and will overlook evil for the
sake of righteous individuals.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.329
And so Abraham haggles with God
for the lives of the innocent:

00:33:33.329 --> 00:33:35.910
"...Shall not the Judge
of all the earth deal justly?"

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.845
And the Lord answered,
"If I find within the city of

00:33:38.845 --> 00:33:42.068
Sodom fifty innocent ones,
I will forgive the whole place

00:33:42.068 --> 00:33:44.276
for their sake."
Abraham spoke up,

00:33:44.276 --> 00:33:46.947
saying, "Here I venture to
speak to my Lord,

00:33:46.947 --> 00:33:50.303
I who am but dust and ashes:
What if the fifty innocent

00:33:50.303 --> 00:33:51.670
should lack five?
 

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.920
Will You destroy the whole city
for want of the five?"

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.125
And He answered,
"I will not destroy if I find

00:33:58.125 --> 00:33:59.549
forty-five there."
 

00:33:59.549 --> 00:34:02.681
But he spoke to Him again,
and said, "What if forty should

00:34:02.681 --> 00:34:04.528
be found there?"
And He answered,

00:34:04.528 --> 00:34:07.049
"I will not do it,
for the sake of the forty."

00:34:07.049 --> 00:34:09.065
And he said,
"Let not my Lord be angry if I

00:34:09.065 --> 00:34:11.610
go on: What if thirty should be
found there?"

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:14.603
And in this way,
Abraham manages to whittle the

00:34:14.603 --> 00:34:16.946
number down to ten:
"And God answers,

00:34:16.946 --> 00:34:20.199
'I will not destroy for the
sake of the ten.'"

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:23.199
But ten innocent men are not
found.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:25.190
The narrator makes that very
clear.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:28.822
He takes pains to point out
that the mob that comes to abuse

00:34:28.822 --> 00:34:32.700
the two divine visitors includes
all the people to the last man:

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.239
very clear statement.
 

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:37.498
So Sodom and its four sister
cities of the plain,

00:34:37.498 --> 00:34:40.010
around the Dead Sea,
are destroyed.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:44.721
But out of consideration for
Abraham, Abraham's nephew Lot is

00:34:44.721 --> 00:34:46.416
saved.
Genesis 19:29:

00:34:46.416 --> 00:34:50.985
"God was mindful of Abraham and
removed Lot from the midst of

00:34:50.985 --> 00:34:53.659
the upheaval."
Now, this text is often

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:57.260
identified as the source for the
doctrine of the merit of the

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.040
righteous,
 

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:08.650
 
 

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:12.980
which is the idea that someone
who is not righteous is spared

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.727
for the sake of,
or on account of,

00:35:15.727 --> 00:35:19.389
the accrued merit of one who is
righteous.

00:35:19.389 --> 00:35:23.810
So Lot himself is no prize,
but he is spared on Abraham's

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.911
account.
This is an idea that will have

00:35:26.911 --> 00:35:30.070
repercussions in later biblical
thought.

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.643
In this story,
we see Abraham rising to the

00:35:32.643 --> 00:35:36.075
defense of a thoroughly wicked
and reprehensible group of

00:35:36.075 --> 00:35:38.375
people,
arguing quite pointedly that

00:35:38.375 --> 00:35:41.219
the innocent should never be
wantonly destroyed.

00:35:41.219 --> 00:35:45.192
Can this be the same Abraham
who a few chapters later,

00:35:45.192 --> 00:35:48.039
when told to slaughter his only
son,

00:35:48.039 --> 00:35:51.987
his perfectly innocent and
presumably deeply loved son,

00:35:51.987 --> 00:35:56.110
not only makes no objection,
but rises early in the morning

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:59.969
to get started on the long
journey to the sacrificial site?

00:35:59.969 --> 00:36:03.450
What are we to make of the
juxtaposition of these two

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:07.738
stories?
Which represents behavior more

00:36:07.738 --> 00:36:09.909
desirable to God?
 

00:36:09.909 --> 00:36:13.043
Before leaving this story,
I just want to make two quick

00:36:13.043 --> 00:36:15.342
comments.
First, I've included in your

00:36:15.342 --> 00:36:17.672
reading packet,
and it's uploaded on the

00:36:17.672 --> 00:36:20.330
website,
a very interesting article by a

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:24.136
writer who relates her efforts
since childhood to understand

00:36:24.136 --> 00:36:28.137
why Lot's wife should have been
turned into a pillar of salt as

00:36:28.137 --> 00:36:32.460
punishment for looking back as
she fled from her burning home.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.788
It's not a biblical scholar,
but someone who's simply

00:36:35.788 --> 00:36:37.260
reacting to the text.
 

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.752
Was this, in fact,
a punishment,

00:36:39.752 --> 00:36:41.360
or was it a mercy?
 

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.231
Second, the story of Sodom and
Gomorrah has often been cited as

00:36:46.231 --> 00:36:49.610
a biblical condemnation of
homosexuality,

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:53.018
as if the Sodomites were
condemned to destruction because

00:36:53.018 --> 00:36:54.539
of homosexual behavior.
 

00:36:54.539 --> 00:36:58.669
In fact the very terms "sodomy"
and "sodomize" represent this

00:36:58.669 --> 00:37:01.290
interpretation.
But the idea that the

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:05.019
fundamental sin of Sodom was
homosexual behavior is not

00:37:05.019 --> 00:37:07.159
present in the Hebrew Bible.
 

00:37:07.159 --> 00:37:09.360
It appears only in later
documents.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.974
It's found in the Christian New
Testament, in the book of Jude

00:37:12.974 --> 00:37:16.210
7:2;
the book of Peter 2:6-10;

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.690
and subsequent interpretations.
 

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:21.026
The Sodomites,
like the generation of the

00:37:21.026 --> 00:37:24.179
Flood, stand condemned by the
"outcry against them,"

00:37:24.179 --> 00:37:27.059
a particular Hebrew word that's
used to refer to outcry.

00:37:27.059 --> 00:37:30.916
It's a term that's generally
associated with the appeal of

00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:34.570
victims of violent oppression,
bloodshed, injustice.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:38.491
God hears this outcry of
victims, against the Sodomites:

00:37:38.491 --> 00:37:42.342
the Sodomites' violation of the
unwritten desert law of

00:37:42.342 --> 00:37:45.980
hospitality to strangers,
their violent desire to abuse

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.851
and gang rape the strangers that
they should have been

00:37:48.851 --> 00:37:51.298
sheltering.
This is merely one instance of

00:37:51.298 --> 00:37:53.100
a pattern of violent brutality.
 

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:59.090
 
 

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:02.612
Now, Isaac, who is the child of
God's promise to Abraham,

00:38:02.612 --> 00:38:06.386
is often described as the most
invisible of the patriarchs or

00:38:06.386 --> 00:38:08.840
the most passive of the
patriarchs.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.021
Perhaps his passive acceptance
of his father's effort to

00:38:12.021 --> 00:38:15.318
sacrifice him serves as the key
to the biblical narrator's

00:38:15.318 --> 00:38:17.170
perception of his character.
 

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.774
By contrast,
his wife Rebekah is often

00:38:19.774 --> 00:38:24.489
described as the most determined
and energetic of the matriarchs.

00:38:24.489 --> 00:38:27.820
She runs to extend hospitality
to a stranger.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.809
She quickly draws water for him.
 

00:38:29.809 --> 00:38:33.610
She quickly draws water for his
camels and waters them all.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.906
She seems to run everywhere,
and she does all this not

00:38:36.906 --> 00:38:40.637
knowing that the man she greets
is the servant of Abraham who

00:38:40.637 --> 00:38:43.373
has come to seek a wife for his
master's son,

00:38:43.373 --> 00:38:45.580
Isaac.
Rebekah herself personally,

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.825
accepts the offer of an unknown
bridegroom in a far away land

00:38:48.825 --> 00:38:52.232
and overrides the urgings of her
mother and her brother to delay

00:38:52.232 --> 00:38:54.830
her departure.
No, she says, I'm ready to go.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:57.429
I'll go now.
There's a very moving

00:38:57.429 --> 00:38:59.630
conclusion to the betrothal
story.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:04.235
We read in Genesis 24:67 that
Isaac brought Rebekah "into the

00:39:04.235 --> 00:39:08.149
tent of his mother Sarah,
and he took Rebekah as his

00:39:08.149 --> 00:39:10.635
wife.
Isaac loved her and thus found

00:39:10.635 --> 00:39:12.730
comfort after his mother's
death."

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:16.329
But like the other matriarchs,
Rebekah is barren.

00:39:16.329 --> 00:39:19.690
So Isaac pleads with the lord
for a child on her behalf.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.409
And Rebekah becomes pregnant
with twins.

00:39:22.409 --> 00:39:26.019
The older child is Esau--Esau
will be the father of the

00:39:26.019 --> 00:39:30.030
Edomites--and the younger is
Jacob, who will be the father of

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:33.580
the Israelites.
Now, Jacob is the most fully

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:38.059
developed, the most colorful and
the most complex of the

00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:41.353
patriarchs.
Jacob has long been identified

00:39:41.353 --> 00:39:45.659
by commentators as the classic
trickster, a type that we know

00:39:45.659 --> 00:39:48.616
from folklore.
Marc Brettler has described the

00:39:48.616 --> 00:39:50.858
Jacob stories as a kind of
morality tale,

00:39:50.858 --> 00:39:53.715
the main message of which is
"trick and you shall be

00:39:53.715 --> 00:39:56.588
tricked".
Jacob tricks his brother out of

00:39:56.588 --> 00:39:59.553
his birthright,
and in turn is tricked by his

00:39:59.553 --> 00:40:02.316
brother-in-law,
his wife and later his own

00:40:02.316 --> 00:40:05.520
sons.
How much of Jacob's trickery is

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.989
really necessary?
 

00:40:06.989 --> 00:40:10.065
After all, Rebekah,
who suffers tremendous pain

00:40:10.065 --> 00:40:13.407
during her pregnancy,
is told by God that the twins

00:40:13.407 --> 00:40:17.418
who are fighting and struggling
for priority in her womb will

00:40:17.418 --> 00:40:20.974
become two nations,
the older of which will serve

00:40:20.974 --> 00:40:24.530
the younger.
That happens in Genesis 25:23.

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:27.727
"Two nations are in your womb;
two separate peoples shall

00:40:27.727 --> 00:40:30.350
issue from your body;
one people shall be mightier

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:33.080
than the other;
and the older shall serve the

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.390
younger."
And indeed, the real life

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:39.393
nations of Israel and Edom were
long-time enemies--Esau is the

00:40:39.393 --> 00:40:43.593
father of the Edomites according
to the biblical texts--and for a

00:40:43.593 --> 00:40:46.409
time,
Edom was subjugated by Israel,

00:40:46.409 --> 00:40:50.079
according to the biblical
texts, under King David.

00:40:50.079 --> 00:40:52.880
Some scholars,
like Nahum Sarna have argued

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.413
that this announcement,
that the older shall serve the

00:40:56.413 --> 00:41:00.679
younger is the narrator's way of
establishing for the reader that

00:41:00.679 --> 00:41:04.235
the younger child,
Jacob, is the son who will

00:41:04.235 --> 00:41:08.223
inherit the divine blessing,
and that that then raises

00:41:08.223 --> 00:41:12.586
serious questions about Rebekah
and Jacob's morally dubious

00:41:12.586 --> 00:41:17.099
efforts to wrest the blessing
and birthright from Esau.

00:41:17.099 --> 00:41:20.648
Are we supposed to be comforted
by the fact that they are

00:41:20.648 --> 00:41:22.360
fulfilling a divine plan?
 

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.273
Are we supposed to conclude
that it's alright to fulfill a

00:41:25.273 --> 00:41:27.369
divine plan by any means,
fair or foul?

00:41:27.369 --> 00:41:30.196
Or are we to conclude,
as Sarna and others suggest,

00:41:30.196 --> 00:41:33.531
that Jacob's possession of the
birthright was predetermined,

00:41:33.531 --> 00:41:36.639
it was disengaged from all of
his acts of trickery?

00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:41.545
And if so, then Jacob's efforts
are indicative of a deceitful

00:41:41.545 --> 00:41:44.079
and narcissistic personality?
 

00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:47.824
He takes advantage of Esau's
hunger, offering him a pot of

00:41:47.824 --> 00:41:50.780
lentil stew in exchange for the
birthright.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.528
He and Rebekah plot to deceive
Isaac in his dotage into

00:41:54.528 --> 00:41:58.555
bestowing the blessing of the
firstborn on Jacob instead of

00:41:58.555 --> 00:42:01.221
Esau.
So perhaps by informing us that

00:42:01.221 --> 00:42:05.106
Jacob had been chosen from the
womb, the narrator is able to

00:42:05.106 --> 00:42:08.596
paint a portrait of Jacob at
this stage in his life as

00:42:08.596 --> 00:42:11.626
grasping and faithless:
a great contrast to his

00:42:11.626 --> 00:42:13.469
grandfather, Abraham.
 

00:42:13.469 --> 00:42:16.943
Now, Jacob's poor treatment of
his brother, Esau,

00:42:16.943 --> 00:42:20.851
earns him Esau's enmity and
Jacob finds it expedient to

00:42:20.851 --> 00:42:25.121
leave Canaan and remain at the
home of his mother's brother,

00:42:25.121 --> 00:42:27.331
Laban.
On his way east,

00:42:27.331 --> 00:42:31.692
back to Mesopotamia from
Canaan, where Laban resides,

00:42:31.692 --> 00:42:35.215
in Mesopotamia,
Jacob has an encounter with

00:42:35.215 --> 00:42:38.212
God.
At a place called Luz,

00:42:38.212 --> 00:42:43.820
Jacob lies down to sleep,
resting his head on a stone.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.150
And he has a dream in which he
sees a ladder.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:50.473
The ladder's feet are on the
earth, it reaches to heaven and

00:42:50.473 --> 00:42:53.739
there are angels ascending and
descending on the ladder.

00:42:53.739 --> 00:42:56.895
In the dream,
God appears to Jacob and

00:42:56.895 --> 00:43:01.159
reaffirms the Abrahamic or
patriarchal covenant.

00:43:01.159 --> 00:43:04.086
He promises land,
posterity and in addition,

00:43:04.086 --> 00:43:07.352
Jacob's own safety,
his own personal safety until

00:43:07.352 --> 00:43:09.869
he returns to the land of
Israel.

00:43:09.869 --> 00:43:13.099
Jacob is stunned:
we read in Genesis 28:16-17:

00:43:13.099 --> 00:43:17.333
"Jacob awoke from his sleep and
said, 'Surely the Lord is in

00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:19.679
this place;
and I did not know it.'

00:43:19.679 --> 00:43:22.159
/ Shaken, he said,
'How awesome is this place!

00:43:22.159 --> 00:43:24.375
This is none other than the
abode of God,

00:43:24.375 --> 00:43:26.480
and that is the gateway to
heaven.'"

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.339
The stone that served as his
pillow, he then sets up as a

00:43:30.339 --> 00:43:33.440
cultic pillar,
some sort of memorial stone.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.005
He sanctifies the stone with
oil and he renames the site

00:43:37.005 --> 00:43:40.570
Bethel, Beyt El,
which means the house of God.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:45.061
But it's significant that
despite this direct vision,

00:43:45.061 --> 00:43:49.726
Jacob, so unlike Abraham,
is still reluctant to rely on

00:43:49.726 --> 00:43:51.800
God and his promise.
 

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.610
And he makes a conditional vow:
If God remains with me,

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.840
if He protects me on this
journey that I am making,

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.992
and gives me bread to eat and
clothing to wear,

00:44:01.992 --> 00:44:05.830
and if I return safe to my
father's house--the Lord shall

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:07.565
be my God.
And this stone,

00:44:07.565 --> 00:44:10.409
which I have set up as a
pillar, shall be God's abode;

00:44:10.409 --> 00:44:13.317
and of all that You give me,
I will set aside a tithe for

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:15.619
You.
So where once God had tested

00:44:15.619 --> 00:44:18.980
Abraham, it seems now that Jacob
is almost testing God.

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:22.329
If you can do all this,
fine: you can be my God.

00:44:22.329 --> 00:44:26.484
Well, Jacob spends some 14
years in the household of his

00:44:26.484 --> 00:44:29.280
uncle, his mother's brother,
Laban.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.185
And Jacob meets Laban's two
daughters: Leah is the elder

00:44:32.185 --> 00:44:34.140
daughter and Rachel is the
younger.

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.800
And he soon loves Rachel.
 

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.152
He agrees to serve Laban for
seven years for the hand of the

00:44:40.152 --> 00:44:41.630
younger daughter Rachel.
 

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:45.582
When the seven years pass,
Laban deceives Jacob and gives

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:47.769
him the elder daughter,
Leah.

00:44:47.769 --> 00:44:51.020
Jacob, the trickster,
is furious at having been

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:54.129
tricked himself,
and in much the same way--an

00:44:54.129 --> 00:44:58.033
older and a younger sibling,
one disguised as the other or

00:44:58.033 --> 00:45:01.206
wearing the covering of the
other, just as he tricked his

00:45:01.206 --> 00:45:04.074
own father.
But he is willing to give seven

00:45:04.074 --> 00:45:06.150
years more service for Rachel.
 

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:09.062
Rachel, Leah,
and their two handmaidens will

00:45:09.062 --> 00:45:13.127
conceive one daughter and 12
sons, from whom will come the 12

00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:14.550
tribes of Israel.
 

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:17.810
But it's the two sons of
Rachel, the beloved wife,

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:20.671
the two sons of Rachel,
Joseph and Benjamin,

00:45:20.671 --> 00:45:23.199
who are the most beloved to
Jacob.

00:45:23.199 --> 00:45:27.044
Jacob determines finally to
leave Laban and return to

00:45:27.044 --> 00:45:29.647
Canaan.
There's one final remarkable

00:45:29.647 --> 00:45:33.800
incident in Jacob's life that
occurs on his return journey.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.398
It's an incident that most
readers associate with a

00:45:36.398 --> 00:45:38.789
significant transformation in
his character,

00:45:38.789 --> 00:45:42.416
and that is Jacob's nighttime
struggle with a mysterious

00:45:42.416 --> 00:45:45.780
figure, who in some way is
representative of God.

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.655
This struggle occurs as he is
about to cross the river Jabbok

00:45:49.655 --> 00:45:53.078
and reconcile himself with his
former rival and enemy,

00:45:53.078 --> 00:45:55.205
Esau.
Jacob has sent everyone on

00:45:55.205 --> 00:45:56.988
ahead: his wives,
his children,

00:45:56.988 --> 00:45:59.010
his household,
his possessions.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.370
He's standing alone at the
river.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:07.989
And we read, Genesis 32:25-33.:
… a man wrestled with

00:46:07.989 --> 00:46:09.260
him until the break of dawn.
 

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.462
When he saw that he had not
prevailed against him,

00:46:11.462 --> 00:46:13.260
he wrenched Jacob's hip at its
socket,

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.319
so that the socket of his hip
was strained as he wrestled with

00:46:16.319 --> 00:46:17.269
him.
Then he said,

00:46:17.269 --> 00:46:19.019
"Let me go, for dawn is
breaking."

00:46:19.019 --> 00:46:20.730
But he answered,
"I will not let you go,

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:21.739
unless you bless me."
 

00:46:21.739 --> 00:46:23.270
Said the other,
"What is your name?"

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:24.639
He replied, "Jacob."
 

00:46:24.639 --> 00:46:27.501
Said he, "Your name shall no
longer be Jacob,

00:46:27.501 --> 00:46:30.688
but Israel, for you have
striven with God and men,

00:46:30.688 --> 00:46:32.250
and have prevailed."
 

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:34.289
Jacob asked,
"Pray tell me your name."

00:46:34.289 --> 00:46:36.010
But he said,
"You must not ask my name!"

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:37.380
And he took leave of him there.
 

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.669
So Jacob named the place
Peniel, meaning,

00:46:39.669 --> 00:46:41.959
"I have seen a divine being
face to face,

00:46:41.959 --> 00:46:44.019
yet my life has been
preserved."

00:46:44.019 --> 00:46:47.119
The sun rose upon him as he
passed Peniel,

00:46:47.119 --> 00:46:50.061
limping on his hip.
Many scholars,

00:46:50.061 --> 00:46:53.666
Michael Coogan and others,
see this story as an Israelite

00:46:53.666 --> 00:46:57.594
adaptation of popular stories of
river gods who threaten those

00:46:57.594 --> 00:47:01.596
who wish to cross a river,
or trolls or ogres who guard

00:47:01.596 --> 00:47:06.039
rivers and have to be defeated
by a hero, making the river safe

00:47:06.039 --> 00:47:08.621
to cross.
In its Israelite version,

00:47:08.621 --> 00:47:11.170
however, this story is
historicized.

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:13.139
It serves an etiological
function.

00:47:13.139 --> 00:47:16.201
It's associated with one
particular character at a

00:47:16.201 --> 00:47:19.826
historical time and it serves to
explain why the Israelites

00:47:19.826 --> 00:47:23.325
abstained from eating the
sciatic nerve of an animal even

00:47:23.325 --> 00:47:26.286
to this day.
We also learn how Peniel gets

00:47:26.286 --> 00:47:28.880
its name.
We learn how Israel gets his

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.650
name.
Names are an important theme of

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:34.236
this story.
In the biblical context,

00:47:34.236 --> 00:47:37.519
names encapsulate the essence
of their bearer.

00:47:37.519 --> 00:47:40.878
Naming something or knowing the
name of something gives one

00:47:40.878 --> 00:47:42.441
control over,
or power over,

00:47:42.441 --> 00:47:44.585
that thing.
And that's why the stranger

00:47:44.585 --> 00:47:46.239
will not reveal his name to
Jacob.

00:47:46.239 --> 00:47:48.070
It would give Jacob power over
him.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:51.663
Jacob's own name is the
occasion for some punning in

00:47:51.663 --> 00:47:54.727
this story.
His name is built on this root

00:47:54.727 --> 00:47:58.880
Y.'.Q.B: Ya-'a-qov It
means to supplant or uproot.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.469
He emerges from the womb
grasping his brother's heel.

00:48:02.469 --> 00:48:06.101
'aqev here,
the word for "heel," is based

00:48:06.101 --> 00:48:08.543
on that root.
It's part of his effort to

00:48:08.543 --> 00:48:11.504
supplant Esau right at birth,
and he continues that effort at

00:48:11.504 --> 00:48:13.380
supplanting through his early
life.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:17.074
The writer makes that explicit
in Genesis 27:36 when Esau cries

00:48:17.074 --> 00:48:20.113
out, "Was he then named
Ya'aqov that he might

00:48:20.113 --> 00:48:22.080
supplant me these two times?"
 

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.642
Yes.
And in this chapter,

00:48:24.642 --> 00:48:26.210
Jacob wrestles.
 

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:29.297
The word for wrestle is built
on this root,

00:48:29.297 --> 00:48:31.429
just switching two letters.
 

00:48:31.429 --> 00:48:34.922
He wrestles with the
mysterious, divine being at the

00:48:34.922 --> 00:48:38.263
Jabbok river.
So you see all of this punning

00:48:38.263 --> 00:48:41.212
with the name.
Jacob's very name hints at and

00:48:41.212 --> 00:48:43.662
foreshadows the struggling,
the wrestling,

00:48:43.662 --> 00:48:46.889
the trickery that are the major
themes of his life.

00:48:46.889 --> 00:48:50.050
But his striving has reached a
climax here.

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:53.082
And so the angel names him
Yisra'el, Israel,

00:48:53.082 --> 00:48:55.630
which means he who has striven
with God.

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:58.528
Because as the stranger says,
he has striven and wrestled all

00:48:58.528 --> 00:49:00.605
his life with men,
particularly his brother,

00:49:00.605 --> 00:49:01.620
and now with God.
 

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.139
El means god.
 

00:49:03.139 --> 00:49:06.500
It's the name of the chief god
of the pantheon of Canaan.

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.780
Yisra'el,
he who has struggled with God.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.982
We'll talk about the way in
which the change of name means a

00:49:11.982 --> 00:49:14.425
change of character,
change of essence for the

00:49:14.425 --> 00:49:16.000
patriarch when we return.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.448
Prof: Today,
I want to do the impossible and

00:00:05.448 --> 00:00:09.430
talk about urbanization and
urban growth in fifty minutes.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.125
It builds on what you're
reading and I'll give the

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:15.866
classic example,
which is the greatest project

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:19.400
of human intervention or
rebuilding,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.830
that is the rebuilding of Paris
by that man that my late friend,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.159
Richard Cobb,
once dissed as the

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.220
"Alsacian Attila."
 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.803
In doing so,
I want to emphasize a couple

00:00:30.803 --> 00:00:31.610
points.
 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.779
One is that the nineteenth
century was a period of

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:37.560
phenomenal urban growth and
urbanization.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.000
I will distinguish those in a
minute.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.576
Secondly, one of the things
that emerges out of this urban

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:47.633
growth and urbanization,
but particularly the growth of

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:51.730
cities large and medium in the
nineteenth century,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.790
is an increasing geography of
class segregation.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.405
The theme of course in Paris,
as in other cities--London is a

00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:05.119
good example--is a more
prosperous west and an

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.409
increasingly less prosperous
east.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.581
Also, one of the things that I
really enjoy talking about in

00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:15.683
trying to help people understand
is why it is that European

00:01:15.683 --> 00:01:19.150
suburbs are not at all like
American suburbs.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.906
Why is it that some people
feared by elites were perched on

00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:28.640
the edge of European cities,
whether it's Vienna, Paris,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.560
or lots of other places,
and not in the center; whereas,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.150
in the United States,
if you think of the riots in

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.935
1967,
before most of your times,

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:45.300
in Detroit, or Newark,
or Watts, or East L.A.,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.379
it was people in the center
with the wealthy people in the

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:55.459
periphery fearing the poor
people living in the center.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.980
Why is it just completely
different?

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.569
I remember in the early 1990s
we were doing a book,

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.301
just a bunch of essays in
France, called Banlieues

00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:08.460
Rouges, which means the red
suburbs.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.680
I was supposed to write
something tying the book

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.199
together.
 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.128
It was at the time of the
Rodney King trial.

00:02:13.128 --> 00:02:15.548
Most of you are--not of the
trial of Rodney King,

00:02:15.548 --> 00:02:18.016
but when Rodney King,
who was an Afro-American who

00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:19.680
was beaten up by cops in L.A.
 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.299
It was filmed by somebody who
just happened to have a camera

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.319
and was filming this.
 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.378
There was a big trial.
 

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:27.720
The police who beat the hell
out of him were acquitted.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.378
They were acquitted by a white
jury in the suburbs.

00:02:32.378 --> 00:02:35.621
People in France couldn't get
over that, the idea of wealthy

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:39.080
people living in the suburbs as
opposed to poor people living in

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.508
the suburbs in Europe.
 

00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:44.210
We had to hold the book for a
couple weeks until I could

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.430
figure out how to explain this.
 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.470
That's one theme also under the
rubric of center and periphery.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.169
Why are European cities
different?

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.961
Human intervention has
something to do with that in the

00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:57.788
case of Paris.
 

00:02:57.788 --> 00:03:00.372
That's fun to talk about,
so I'm going to do that in the

00:03:00.372 --> 00:03:01.500
last half of the talk.
 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.848
Just a few points at the
beginning.

00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:07.762
I sent around,
I hope it will reach you,

00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:11.870
something I sent out on October
16 on this class server,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.378
which has most of these terms
on the board.

00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:18.661
The nineteenth century is a
period of both urban growth and

00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:19.509
urbanization.
 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:20.930
Why are those different?
 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.757
Urban growth is,
say, a population of any

00:03:24.757 --> 00:03:29.157
city--the population of Vienna
rises from, say,

00:03:29.157 --> 00:03:31.550
500,000 to 1,000,000.
 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.949
I don't remember the statistics.
 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:34.389
That is urban growth.
 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.234
Vienna is bigger at the end of
the nineteenth century than it

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:41.181
was at the beginning of the
nineteenth century,

00:03:41.181 --> 00:03:43.360
or any place you want to pick.
 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.616
But the most important point is
that there is urbanization in

00:03:47.616 --> 00:03:49.389
the nineteenth century.
 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.167
You could have urban growth
absolutely and de-urbanization

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:56.031
if,
at the end of any period that

00:03:56.031 --> 00:03:59.610
you're looking at,
you had more people living in

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.875
cities,
but they represented a smaller

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:03.318
percentage of the population.
 

00:04:03.318 --> 00:04:05.649
You could actually have
de-urbanization if you had more

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:08.280
people living in the countryside
at the end of the period,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.508
relative to those living in the
cities.

00:04:11.508 --> 00:04:14.740
So, it depends on how you
define what an urban area is.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.403
In the case of France,
where they have all these great

00:04:18.403 --> 00:04:21.235
censuses all the time,
in the Restoration,

00:04:21.235 --> 00:04:24.899
that is 1815-1830,
a city had 1,500 people in it.

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:29.564
There's that many people lined
up at the Milford Mall when it

00:04:29.564 --> 00:04:31.430
opens in this country.
 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.901
In 1841 they start using 2,000
people agglomerated,

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:39.478
that is, living in an
urban--;the church,

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:40.910
the steeple.
 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.839
Open up the church and look at
all the people or whatever.

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:43.740
You know what I mean.
 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.079
That's an urban area.
 

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:46.480
In the United States,
I have no idea.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.029
A city used to be 5,000.
 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:52.300
I think it may be 25,000 or
something like that.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.410
It doesn't matter.
 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.341
Depending on what you define as
urban, there's a remarkable

00:04:58.341 --> 00:05:03.528
increase in the urban population
in the nineteenth century.

00:05:03.528 --> 00:05:06.994
It's not just big,
huge cities like Naples,

00:05:06.994 --> 00:05:11.035
or Constantinople,
or London, which is so enormous

00:05:11.035 --> 00:05:15.490
compared to Paris,
compared to any city spatially.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.932
But it's also small towns that
increase in size because of

00:05:19.932 --> 00:05:23.910
industrial, commercial,
administrative functions.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.310
All this is perfectly obvious.
 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.350
The nineteenth century is the
growth of big,

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.548
big cities and the first
conurbations,

00:05:31.548 --> 00:05:34.377
that is,
cities that just run into each

00:05:34.377 --> 00:05:37.004
other,
such as now for example Boston

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:40.120
to Washington is practically a
conurbation.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.730
In France it would be Lille,
Tourcoing, Roubaix.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.916
In the north of England it
would be Manchester and its

00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:48.120
expanding suburbs.
 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.879
That's all perfectly obvious.
 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.281
The next step is to say,
"Where does the population

00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:56.598
of cities come from,
and who are all these people

00:05:56.598 --> 00:06:00.839
that are increasing the
population of cities and are

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.120
part of this process,
in a statistical sense,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.778
of urban growth?"
 

00:06:05.778 --> 00:06:08.541
The second point that I'll make
is what people thought about

00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:08.870
this.
 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.689
What did they think about these
teeming cities?

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:14.747
"Teeming"
was a word that they started to

00:06:14.747 --> 00:06:17.988
use to describe these cities
that seemed to be kind of

00:06:17.988 --> 00:06:19.149
runaway cities.
 

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:22.208
First of all,
I'm not going to write this on

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:26.545
the board, despite the fact it's
the only mathematical formula

00:06:26.545 --> 00:06:28.040
that I even know.
 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.964
If you were trying to explain
the growth of any city from

00:06:31.964 --> 00:06:34.629
Point 1 in time to Point 2 in
time,

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:37.435
what you do is simply look at
the population at Point 1 in

00:06:37.435 --> 00:06:40.480
time,
say 1811 or something like that.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.302
Then you try to find out where
the population came from that

00:06:44.302 --> 00:06:48.901
increased it to Point 2 in time,
if the city reclassified what

00:06:48.901 --> 00:06:52.569
was considered urban,
if they annexed its suburbs.

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:56.442
That's what Lyons does in 1852,
or Paris does in 1860 on

00:06:56.442 --> 00:06:59.610
January 1, or almost anywhere
they do this.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.399
That would be one factor.
 

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:03.920
Then you would have births
minus deaths.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.980
Do you have a natural increase
in population?

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.110
The other thing is in versus
out migration.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.651
Do you have more people
arriving in the city than

00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:14.338
leaving it?
 

00:07:14.338 --> 00:07:16.829
There are people leaving and
people arriving all the time.

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:19.375
But if you look at particularly
the first half of the nineteenth

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:24.389
century,
to make a generalization,

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.959
more people die in cities than
are born there,

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:30.000
because cities are very
unhealthy places,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.507
which helps create this kind of
image of biological sickness

00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:36.519
that I'll discuss in a minute,
that I'll evoke with some

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:38.370
conservative commentators from
those times.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.589
What do I mean by that?
 

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:44.560
The average life expectancy in
Manchester, counting infant

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.968
mortality, so it's a little bit
exaggerated, was about nineteen

00:07:49.968 --> 00:07:51.190
years old.
 

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.870
You guys would have about had
it.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.230
Lille, in the north of France,
is the same thing.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.069
That's pretty young.
 

00:07:58.069 --> 00:07:59.720
But that counts life expectancy.
 

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.461
If you made it to the ripe old
age of eighteen,

00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:05.680
then your chances of living
longer were pretty gray.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.778
You still had places where you
have phenomenal,

00:08:08.778 --> 00:08:11.793
still cases particularly in
areas where you have all these

00:08:11.793 --> 00:08:13.910
spinsters in Brittany and in
Ireland,

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.879
of old women who live a very
long time.

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:20.389
Women lived and still live
longer than men.

00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:24.877
Another reason why you have
more people dying in cities,

00:08:24.877 --> 00:08:27.980
among other reasons,
is infanticide.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.220
Foundling homes in these big
cities.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.601
You name the big city--;Rome,
Berlin, anywhere you want,

00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:34.908
St.
 

00:08:34.908 --> 00:08:38.190
Petersburg, Moscow--;they have
huge foundling homes with

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.590
thousands and thousands of
babies abandoned every year.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:46.139
One-third of those babies die
before the end of the next year.

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:47.820
Infanticide.
 

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.602
The church, which obviously
opposes infanticide and

00:08:51.602 --> 00:08:55.840
obviously opposes abortion in
the nineteenth century,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.618
what they do is they finally
agree to put in these little

00:08:58.618 --> 00:09:02.298
things called tours,
T-O-U-R-S.

00:09:02.298 --> 00:09:05.149
It's an awful example to give
and it comes out of an

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:08.000
institution that no longer
exists, Machine City,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.735
but anyplace that you have
those kind of machines and you

00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:13.522
put money in and you hope that
the window is going to turn

00:09:13.522 --> 00:09:15.820
around and actually give you
your M&amp;Ms.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.509
To make a crass example,
that's what these tours were.

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:23.702
They encouraged young women,
usually unmarried or uncoupled

00:09:23.702 --> 00:09:27.894
women, to abandon their babies
instead of exposing them and

00:09:27.894 --> 00:09:29.340
having them die.
 

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.548
You put your baby in the
foundling homes.

00:09:32.548 --> 00:09:34.523
You ring the bell,
you put the baby in this little

00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:37.059
thing that turns around and then
the good sister comes and takes

00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:38.470
the baby to the foundling home.
 

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.134
If all goes well,
the baby will be there in a

00:09:40.134 --> 00:09:42.178
year, but one-third of them are
not there in a year.

00:09:42.178 --> 00:09:45.240
You've got a lot of babies who
die.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.009
This increases the mortality
rate.

00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:49.878
Then you've also got a lot of
old people who come into the

00:09:49.878 --> 00:09:51.690
cities--and young people--to
beg,

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.269
seeking those last vestiges of
charity,

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:58.440
who are clutching at passersby
as they go to church,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.677
and who some people give them
money and most of the people

00:10:00.677 --> 00:10:01.620
don't give them money.
 

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:07.793
Often they form part of the
community, which is obviously

00:10:07.793 --> 00:10:10.440
the case here at Yale.
 

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.210
A lot of the older people die.
 

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.717
Policemen going on their rounds
in any city, Milan,

00:10:14.717 --> 00:10:17.275
or Turin, or anywhere,
are going to find dead people

00:10:17.275 --> 00:10:18.330
the next morning.
 

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.442
You've got more people that die
in cities than are born there,

00:10:21.442 --> 00:10:24.350
really, in most places way into
the nineteenth century.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:31.518
The point is obviously that
it's immigration that causes

00:10:31.518 --> 00:10:35.690
urbanization and urban growth.
 

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:41.594
Massive immigration,
usually from the hinterland,

00:10:41.594 --> 00:10:45.899
that is the region around
cities.

00:10:45.899 --> 00:10:49.485
In the case of Berlin,
northern Germans from

00:10:49.485 --> 00:10:54.072
Brandenburg or Pomerania and
many Poles were moving into

00:10:54.072 --> 00:10:54.990
Berlin.
 

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.129
There were very poor people
moving into Berlin.

00:10:57.129 --> 00:11:00.729
In the case of Paris,
people who come into Paris are

00:11:00.729 --> 00:11:02.759
from Normandy,
or from Champagne,

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:05.480
or from central France where a
lot of them are seasonal

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.200
migrants and they ended up
living there permanently.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.571
In the 1880s you've got a huge
wave of Bretons from Brittany

00:11:11.571 --> 00:11:13.000
who don't speak French.
 

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.700
If you go to the station of
Montparnasse,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.873
you'll see a lot of the cafes
around Montparnasse are named

00:11:17.873 --> 00:11:19.259
after Breton
towns--;"à

00:11:19.259 --> 00:11:21.178
la ville de Saint-Brieuc,"
la ville de Dinon.

00:11:21.178 --> 00:11:23.940
Still today at that station,
Montparnasse,

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.845
the first thing you see when
you get off a train there is a

00:11:27.845 --> 00:11:30.740
sign for public assistance for
Bretons.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.460
It's in the station at
Montparnasse.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.402
The population in Marseilles
includes lots of people from the

00:11:37.402 --> 00:11:39.374
south of France,
from Provence,

00:11:39.374 --> 00:11:40.820
but also Italians.
 

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.798
This is very obvious.
 

00:11:42.798 --> 00:11:46.677
People who move into Barcelona
are far more likely to be

00:11:46.677 --> 00:11:50.342
Catalan than they are to be
Galician, or Castilian or

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:51.330
something.
 

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.139
This is all obvious.
 

00:11:52.139 --> 00:11:53.720
There's no surprises there.
 

00:11:53.720 --> 00:12:00.748
The image that people had of
this rapid migration into cities

00:12:00.748 --> 00:12:02.740
of poor people.
 

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.183
The majority of people who
moved to these cities are poorer

00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:08.558
than the people who are already
there.

00:12:08.558 --> 00:12:12.110
In the case of the 1950s and
1960s, in most of the cities

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.379
it's not the case.
 

00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:16.503
The 1950s and 1960s they were
young professional couples who

00:12:16.503 --> 00:12:19.414
get enough money to come to rent
an apartment in London,

00:12:19.414 --> 00:12:21.245
good luck,
or to buy an apartment in

00:12:21.245 --> 00:12:24.379
London, or in Berlin,
or someplace else, or Munich.

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:27.700
In the nineteenth century you
have waves of poor people.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.249
The kinds of people you've seen
before who are coming to work as

00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:34.179
domestic servants,
coming to work as day laborers.

00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:36.298
In the case of London,
coming to work on the

00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:39.125
teeming--;there's that word
again--;docks of the Thames

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:41.692
River,
as London is that imperial city

00:12:41.692 --> 00:12:43.798
looking out on its vast empire.
 

00:12:43.798 --> 00:12:46.695
The interesting thing about
London, I wish we had days to

00:12:46.695 --> 00:12:49.383
talk about this stuff,
but it's really only in London

00:12:49.383 --> 00:12:51.090
that you had people of color.
 

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.769
You could find them already by
the end of the

00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:55.879
nineteenth-century,
people coming from India,

00:12:55.879 --> 00:12:58.418
from what would become
Pakistan,

00:12:58.418 --> 00:13:00.710
people coming from the
Caribbean.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:05.928
In other cities,
you simply didn't have that.

00:13:05.928 --> 00:13:10.610
The number of North Africans
coming to Paris is merely a

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:14.100
trickle really until after World
War I.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:22.136
Anyway, contemporaries had the
idea that what this whole

00:13:22.136 --> 00:13:25.363
process was,
and I should have written this

00:13:25.363 --> 00:13:26.879
on the board,
but you can write it down if

00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:29.159
you would please,
called the uprooting hypothesis.

00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:30.070
They didn't call it that.
 

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.700
That's social science from the
1960s.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.879
These people were uprooted from
their steady,

00:13:35.879 --> 00:13:40.399
rural roots of organized
religion and from family support

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:43.788
and they are thrown into the
maelstrom,

00:13:43.788 --> 00:13:47.649
into the chaos--sometimes a
creative chaos,

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:51.652
but nonetheless,
the perception was a dangerous

00:13:51.652 --> 00:13:54.668
chaos that was urban life.
 

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:59.687
The result of all of this was
that revolution becomes seen as

00:13:59.687 --> 00:14:02.528
an extension of purse snatching.
 

00:14:02.528 --> 00:14:05.541
In fact, some of the bad social
science from the 1960s in trying

00:14:05.541 --> 00:14:08.265
to explain the riots in Detroit
and places like that said,

00:14:08.265 --> 00:14:11.230
"Well, you've got a lot of
poor people coming from Alabama

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.860
and Arkansas,"
which is certainly the case,

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.389
"or from South and North
Carolina move up to Detroit and

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:19.860
try to get a job in the
factories there.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.053
They get to Detroit and they
just freak out,

00:14:23.053 --> 00:14:26.620
because those rural roots have
been cut."

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.139
You still see this in various
electoral campaigns even today,

00:14:30.139 --> 00:14:33.440
even as I speak,
this idea that cosmopolitanism,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.139
which is also by the way in
almost every language sort of a

00:14:38.139 --> 00:14:40.570
code word for anti-Semitism.
 

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.312
When people say,
"Cities are so

00:14:42.312 --> 00:14:44.601
cosmopolitan,"
they meant they are full of

00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:45.048
Jews.
 

00:14:45.048 --> 00:14:48.673
This is particularly true in
this sort of anti-Semitism and

00:14:48.673 --> 00:14:52.173
racism of eastern and central
Europe where you had such a

00:14:52.173 --> 00:14:55.422
large Jewish population living
in cities like Prague,

00:14:55.422 --> 00:14:57.360
Budapest, Vilnius,
Riga,

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.279
just about anywhere you could
name.

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:03.472
With the kind of increase in
ethnic populations with the

00:15:03.472 --> 00:15:07.820
Estonization of Tallinn or the
Czechization of Prague,

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:13.440
you had fewer Germans and fewer
Jews living in those cities,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.972
but you had this sort of
anti-Semitic discourse that

00:15:15.972 --> 00:15:16.470
lingers.
 

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.960
Vienna is the classic case.
 

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.580
Vienna goes from being sort of
a liberal city in the 1850s and

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.308
1860s to sort of a hotbed of
anti-Semitism,

00:15:24.308 --> 00:15:26.495
where the mayor of Vienna at
the end of the nineteenth

00:15:26.495 --> 00:15:28.980
century,
a buffoon called Carl Lueger,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.320
says,
"I say who's a Jew."

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.658
That's one of his more infamous
statements.

00:15:32.658 --> 00:15:35.129
"I declare who's a Jew and
who isn't."

00:15:35.129 --> 00:15:38.456
Of course, one wants to
understand how Adolf Hitler got

00:15:38.456 --> 00:15:39.690
his anti-Semitism.
 

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.110
It really comes from World War
I,

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.318
but the basis was already laid
there by growing up in Austria

00:15:45.318 --> 00:15:49.600
in the 1890s and the first
decade of the twentieth century.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.466
If you think about that,
does this massive immigration

00:15:54.466 --> 00:15:57.590
necessarily lead to urban chaos?
 

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.730
The answer is obviously not.
 

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:02.279
We have the effect that now we
know a lot about,

00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:03.850
historians,
and social scientists,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.019
and social geographers,
and sociologists,

00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:09.009
which is called chain migration.
 

00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:10.509
Take the case of China.
 

00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:15.240
People who have studied Beijing
discovered a long time ago,

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:22.327
I remember this from days when
I was studying Chinese history

00:16:22.327 --> 00:16:25.875
back at Michigan,
and all these people pouring

00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:27.570
into Beijing in the nineteenth
century.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.179
They formed native places
associations.

00:16:31.179 --> 00:16:35.450
It's obvious.
 

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.328
You get together with people
that you know from your part of

00:16:38.328 --> 00:16:38.720
China.
 

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.301
They are sort of the
intermediaries between you and

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:43.090
the city.
 

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.649
The Irish are a classic case.
 

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:47.880
We've already seen how the
British elite are scared the

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.976
hell out of the Irish,
of the Irish,

00:16:49.976 --> 00:16:52.490
because they're Catholic and
all that.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.259
They don't just pour into
Manchester, Liverpool,

00:16:55.259 --> 00:16:56.850
and London and freak out.
 

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.690
It doesn't work like that at
all.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.759
They live with their families.
 

00:16:58.759 --> 00:16:59.745
Their families make a little
money and say,

00:16:59.745 --> 00:17:00.659
"Why don't you come
along?"

00:17:00.659 --> 00:17:01.740
It's the same thing.
 

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.359
Look at the case of America,
people coming to the United

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.846
States at the end of the
nineteenth century first of all

00:17:07.846 --> 00:17:10.288
massively from northern Italy
and then in the twentieth

00:17:10.288 --> 00:17:11.778
century from southern Italy.
 

00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:15.000
They send money back all the
time.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.055
It's very different than the
Germans who came to the United

00:17:18.055 --> 00:17:18.528
States.
 

00:17:18.528 --> 00:17:20.727
They were almost never in
contact with their families

00:17:20.727 --> 00:17:22.630
again, relatively,
and the same with Swiss.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:23.880
But the Italians always stayed
in contact.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.357
In any case,
all these people,

00:17:25.357 --> 00:17:26.430
it's very sensible.
 

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:32.229
If you come from California to
Yale, there are a couple high

00:17:32.229 --> 00:17:33.900
schools in L.A.
 

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.818
that send all of these students
to Yale.

00:17:35.818 --> 00:17:38.240
If you're kind of freaking out
when you get to Yale and saying,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.538
"All these people are all
so smart,"

00:17:41.538 --> 00:17:43.538
or whatever,
then the next thing you do is

00:17:43.538 --> 00:17:45.214
you go to people that you
wouldn't even say hello to in

00:17:45.214 --> 00:17:47.509
high school and say,
"Why don't we hang out

00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:49.750
tonight,"
or something like that.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.541
You find people who have
origins like you,

00:17:52.541 --> 00:17:55.880
geographic or whatever,
and hang out with them.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.829
It's a logical thing.
 

00:17:56.829 --> 00:17:58.190
It happens every single time.
 

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.259
In the case of people moving to
Paris, Limousins,

00:18:01.259 --> 00:18:05.180
people from the center part of
France, Limousins,

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.047
they live in certain
neighborhoods around the center

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:13.596
of Paris in the way that Bretons
lived around what became the

00:18:13.596 --> 00:18:15.720
station of Montparnasse.
 

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.839
This is chain migration.
 

00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:19.049
You see it in Philadelphia.
 

00:18:19.049 --> 00:18:20.349
You see it in London.
 

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:21.650
You see it in Moscow.
 

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.339
You see it in St. Petersburg.
 

00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:25.348
You see it everywhere.
 

00:18:25.348 --> 00:18:31.743
But, having said that,
that's not the way

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:36.380
contemporaries viewed this.
 

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.853
Let me just give you a couple
examples of how often

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:43.357
well-meaning,
but not always,

00:18:43.357 --> 00:18:48.009
contemporaries saw the
phenomenon of urbanization and

00:18:48.009 --> 00:18:49.710
urban growth.
 

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:54.386
Let's listen to a preacher
called James Shergold Boone,

00:18:54.386 --> 00:18:55.858
minister of St.
 

00:18:55.858 --> 00:18:59.309
John's church in the Paddington
district of London.

00:18:59.309 --> 00:19:00.808
This is his sermon.
 

00:19:00.808 --> 00:19:06.151
When he's talking about cities,
he's evoking Sodom and

00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:07.259
Gomorrah.
 

00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:11.480
"The very extent of
edifices and the very collection

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.098
of vast masses of human beings
onto one spot,

00:19:15.098 --> 00:19:19.140
humanity remaining what it is
(bad is what he means),

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.269
must be fraught with moral
infection."

00:19:21.269 --> 00:19:24.242
They continually use words like
"infection,"

00:19:24.242 --> 00:19:27.327
that there's a biological
inequality of people with each

00:19:27.327 --> 00:19:27.890
other.
 

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:31.450
The poor are biologically less
likely to,

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:35.220
in a world where Darwin and
post-Darwin misuse of Darwin is

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.663
very important,
to survive the challenges of

00:19:38.663 --> 00:19:40.288
illness of disease.
 

00:19:40.288 --> 00:19:43.301
In illness, the cholera carries
away poor people more than rich

00:19:43.301 --> 00:19:43.740
people.
 

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.400
Going back to the good
minister,

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.480
Cities are the centers and
theatres of human ambition,

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.400
human cupidity,
human pleasure.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.964
On the one side,
the appetites,

00:19:52.964 --> 00:19:56.432
the passions,
the carnal corruptions of man

00:19:56.432 --> 00:20:01.608
are forced in a hotbed into a
rank and file luxuriance,

00:20:01.608 --> 00:20:07.782
and countless evils which would
otherwise have a feeble and

00:20:07.782 --> 00:20:14.277
difficult existence are struck
out into activity and warmth by

00:20:14.277 --> 00:20:17.788
mere contact with each other.
 

00:20:17.788 --> 00:20:20.944
On the other side,
many constraints and safeguards

00:20:20.944 --> 00:20:23.068
are weakened or even withdrawn.
 

00:20:23.068 --> 00:20:27.442
This is what I mean by leaving
those imaginary rural roots in

00:20:27.442 --> 00:20:31.598
which solidarity was considered
to be automatic and family

00:20:31.598 --> 00:20:35.269
support so very,
very important.

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:39.088
"In cities there is a
complication of evils.

00:20:39.088 --> 00:20:43.868
External forces cooperate with
inward desires."

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:48.868
You can conquer those inward
bad desires in the countryside,

00:20:48.868 --> 00:20:53.529
but all is lost in the demon
rum of moral corruption.

00:20:53.529 --> 00:20:59.930
The reality is from urban life,
etc., etc.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:07.372
Sir Charles Shaw,
who was police chief of

00:21:07.372 --> 00:21:18.348
Manchester, described the
residents of industrial cities.

00:21:18.348 --> 00:21:21.865
He called the residents of
industrial cities such as his

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:25.446
own as "the debris which
the vast whirlpool of human

00:21:25.446 --> 00:21:28.579
affairs deposited here in one of
its eddies,

00:21:28.579 --> 00:21:34.005
associated but not united,
contiguous but not

00:21:34.005 --> 00:21:35.380
connected."
 

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.640
That's a perfect description of
the uprooting hypothesis.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:47.779
There's nothing you can do to
save people from themselves.

00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:52.131
To take an example from Paris,
because I'm going to talk about

00:21:52.131 --> 00:21:54.912
Paris in a while,
in the 1830s a certain

00:21:54.912 --> 00:21:57.980
Vicomte--quite
forgettable--exclaimed,

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.038
How ugly Paris seems after one
year away.

00:22:01.038 --> 00:22:07.070
How one stifles in these dark,
damp, narrow corridors which

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:11.960
you are pleased to call the
streets of Paris.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.746
One would think that it was an
underground city,

00:22:14.746 --> 00:22:17.828
so sluggish in the air,
so profound the obscurity.

00:22:17.828 --> 00:22:25.229
In it thousands of people live,
bustle, throng in the liquid

00:22:25.229 --> 00:22:29.869
darkness, like reptiles in a
marsh.

00:22:29.869 --> 00:22:31.420
Or Victor Hugo.
 

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.809
"Cities,
like forests,

00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:36.074
have their dens in which hide
all the vilest and most terrible

00:22:36.074 --> 00:22:36.769
monsters.
 

00:22:36.769 --> 00:22:38.848
All is ferocious."
 

00:22:38.848 --> 00:22:44.040
It couldn't be any more
condemning than--particularly in

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.440
Germany,
where the whole sense of having

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.230
a hometown,
of being attached to a

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:55.061
particular space and all of the
corruption that comes from big

00:22:55.061 --> 00:22:55.690
cities.
 

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.230
You see this over and over
again.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.318
Take New York.
 

00:23:00.318 --> 00:23:02.357
Here's another reverend,
the Rev.

00:23:02.357 --> 00:23:04.970
Amory D. Mayo,
who attacked the city.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.180
All the dangers of the town may
be summed up here,

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.316
that here withdrawn from the
blessed influence of nature and

00:23:12.316 --> 00:23:14.910
set face to face against
humanity,

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.683
mankind loses his own nature
and becomes a new and artificial

00:23:18.683 --> 00:23:22.330
creature,
an unhuman cog in a social

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.890
machinery that works like fate.
 

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.962
Again, in Émile Zola,
the theme of fate is terribly

00:23:28.962 --> 00:23:31.240
important,
of destiny along with,

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.480
as you'll see,
people that have those,

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.578
if you've read other Zola,
that have the bad genes.

00:23:36.578 --> 00:23:40.210
They've got the drinking genes
or whatever.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:46.950
You find all this appalling
stuff.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:50.865
Here's another one in a lecture
in 1844, The Young

00:23:50.865 --> 00:23:52.068
Americans.
 

00:23:52.068 --> 00:23:55.525
The cities drain the country of
the best part of its population,

00:23:55.525 --> 00:23:57.720
the flower of its youth of both
sexes.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.213
They go into the town and the
country is cultivated by a so

00:24:01.213 --> 00:24:02.539
much inferior class.
 

00:24:02.539 --> 00:24:05.759
Et cetera, et cetera.
 

00:24:05.759 --> 00:24:07.548
That was the image.
 

00:24:07.548 --> 00:24:11.210
And, of course,
all of the revolutions have a

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.039
lot to do with that.
 

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:14.759
Simon, I can't find my wand.
 

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:21.250
Is it up there?
 

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.059
It's not?
 

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:26.250
Voilà.
 

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.490
Can you do it?
 

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:29.519
Thanks.
 

00:24:29.519 --> 00:24:32.190
Let's look at an example of
this.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.348
I'm sorry, I can't click.
 

00:24:33.348 --> 00:24:35.246
I'm just going to have to wave
my hands frenetically,

00:24:35.246 --> 00:24:36.558
or something,
or jump up and down.

00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:40.640
I want you to look at Paris and
think about what I've said.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.940
This is Paris in 1839.
 

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.990
Compared to London--I don't
have to talk about this.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.750
In London you can walk miles
and you're still staggering

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.808
around looking for the next Tube
stop,

00:24:50.808 --> 00:24:52.200
because it's about three times
as big,

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.078
at least three times as big
physically.

00:24:54.078 --> 00:24:57.284
Paris, in 1837 you could walk
from the Arc de Triomphe,

00:24:57.284 --> 00:25:00.547
which is up on the left,
to the ending about an hour and

00:25:00.547 --> 00:25:01.200
a half.
 

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.303
This is before the inner
suburbs are annexed for tax

00:25:04.303 --> 00:25:07.528
reasons, but also for reasons of
imposing order on the

00:25:07.528 --> 00:25:09.109
troublesome periphery.
 

00:25:09.109 --> 00:25:10.700
This is part of the lecture.
 

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.390
What you've got is,
if you know Paris at all,

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:14.771
it doesn't matter if you don't
know Paris, here's the Garden of

00:25:14.771 --> 00:25:15.308
Luxemburg.
 

00:25:15.308 --> 00:25:17.410
You've got the Tuileries up
along the Seine there.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.640
You've got your basic Seine
river.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.529
You did have three islands,
now there are but two.

00:25:20.529 --> 00:25:22.078
They cemented that one over.
 

00:25:22.078 --> 00:25:24.412
Ile Saint-Louis there,
which is now one of the great

00:25:24.412 --> 00:25:26.103
tourist traps in western
civilization,

00:25:26.103 --> 00:25:27.430
but it's still beautiful.
 

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.007
There's Cité
with old Notre Dame right in

00:25:30.007 --> 00:25:30.720
the middle.
 

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.259
You've got an enormous
population.

00:25:32.259 --> 00:25:35.227
You've got in the central
districts three times the

00:25:35.227 --> 00:25:37.720
density of population that you
have now.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.619
We have an apartment in the
Marais a couple of blocks up

00:25:40.619 --> 00:25:41.568
from Notre Dame.
 

00:25:41.568 --> 00:25:45.094
The density there in the 1840s
in this neighborhood which is

00:25:45.094 --> 00:25:48.259
called the _______,
was three times what it is now.

00:25:48.259 --> 00:25:52.041
You've got this enormous
implosion of people into the

00:25:52.041 --> 00:25:54.079
center from the provinces.
 

00:25:54.079 --> 00:25:55.410
Next one, please.
 

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.230
Voilà.
 

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.722
The reason I put this up here,
this is the first photo of

00:25:59.722 --> 00:26:00.078
Paris.
 

00:26:00.078 --> 00:26:01.626
This is what you call the
daguerreotype,

00:26:01.626 --> 00:26:02.538
daguerreotype.
 

00:26:02.538 --> 00:26:05.727
I can identify this as--I'm
sure not the only one,

00:26:05.727 --> 00:26:07.940
but this is the
faubourg.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.848
It's an English word as well as
French.

00:26:10.848 --> 00:26:13.900
It means it's sort of an
extension of the town.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.298
It's a difficult etymology.
 

00:26:15.298 --> 00:26:17.442
It doesn't really come from
false bourg,

00:26:17.442 --> 00:26:18.559
but from other things.
 

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:19.609
It's beyond the walls.
 

00:26:19.609 --> 00:26:20.500
But this is the first one.
 

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.028
This is also from about 1837.
 

00:26:24.028 --> 00:26:25.920
Now, Haussmann,
the Alsacian Attila,

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.106
he built these boulevards that
became the staging ground for

00:26:29.106 --> 00:26:31.160
the so-called Belle
Époque.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.888
But there were also boulevards
anywhere around,

00:26:33.888 --> 00:26:37.450
because the boulevards were
where the walls had once been.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:38.769
Vienna is a great example.
 

00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:43.241
The rings around Vienna were
the rings where the walls had

00:26:43.241 --> 00:26:46.930
been that were knocked down as
the city grew.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.029
In Berlin you find the same
thing.

00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:53.019
Next, please.
 

00:26:53.019 --> 00:26:54.309
This is cheating a little bit.
 

00:26:54.309 --> 00:26:57.308
This is just unhealthy.
 

00:26:57.308 --> 00:26:58.200
This is an eighteenth-century
hat.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.078
Look at the guy.
 

00:26:59.078 --> 00:27:00.920
He's a nineteenth-century guy
looking progressively forward to

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.460
the nineteenth century with his
bourgeois outfit.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.390
This could be the Restoration,
actually.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:05.440
He's going to get hit.
 

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.828
"It's raining,"
he says, but it's not.

00:27:06.828 --> 00:27:09.828
It's a chamber pot being dumped
on his head.

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:14.390
In the 1860s only about ten
percent of buildings had water

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:16.390
above the second floor.
 

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.798
Next, please.
 

00:27:18.798 --> 00:27:22.710
This is by a guy called Charles
Meryon.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.538
It doesn't matter.
 

00:27:23.538 --> 00:27:25.318
The point of this is this is
Cité.

00:27:25.318 --> 00:27:30.220
There's Notre Dame there,
before Viollet-le-Duc's big

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.538
spire on it.
 

00:27:31.538 --> 00:27:34.983
The point is that before the
rebuilding of Paris this was

00:27:34.983 --> 00:27:38.058
among the most densely populated
parts of Paris.

00:27:38.058 --> 00:27:40.395
At the end of the period,
that is 1870,

00:27:40.395 --> 00:27:43.410
it's the least densely
populated part of Paris.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.730
Because--remember capitalism
and the state?

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.369
They build government buildings.
 

00:27:48.369 --> 00:27:50.630
The hospital is one of them.
 

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.710
The Prefecture of Police,
which had all the fighting

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.730
around it in 1944,
in August, was built as well.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.338
These places disappear.
 

00:28:00.338 --> 00:28:04.490
The morgue, one of the more
important morgues was here also.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:08.809
That again, gave the idea of
the disease of the center city.

00:28:08.809 --> 00:28:12.400
Next, please.
 

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.470
Name those people.
 

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:14.210
There we go.
 

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:15.650
Paris on the left.
 

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.990
It's 1850.
 

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:19.750
Paris on the right.
 

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:21.308
They're all running together.
 

00:28:21.308 --> 00:28:23.828
You see there's a lot more
people.

00:28:23.828 --> 00:28:26.848
You have the filling-in of the
center.

00:28:26.848 --> 00:28:30.720
You've got the periphery with
the emergence of these suburbs.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.494
It's the suburbs that have
increasingly poor people living

00:28:33.494 --> 00:28:36.319
in them who can't afford to live
in the center of Paris.

00:28:36.319 --> 00:28:37.369
That's the big difference.
 

00:28:37.369 --> 00:28:38.868
That's a big, big difference.
 

00:28:38.868 --> 00:28:41.940
You have a customs barrier
around Paris.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.006
Every time you bring things
into the city,

00:28:44.006 --> 00:28:46.828
or any other French city,
you have to pay taxes on it.

00:28:46.828 --> 00:28:48.940
A six-pack of beer,
you pay a tax.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:52.000
You have more space outside the
city walls, so that's where you

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.890
build factories.
 

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.422
You're nearer to the canals and
to railroads,

00:28:55.422 --> 00:28:57.608
so that's where you build
factories.

00:28:57.608 --> 00:29:01.061
The center city froze the
unwanted industries,

00:29:01.061 --> 00:29:05.359
the dirty industries--;soap,
chemical, etc.--;outside.

00:29:05.359 --> 00:29:07.058
Paris doesn't de-industrialize.
 

00:29:07.058 --> 00:29:08.410
You still have the garment
industry.

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:11.143
But the dirty industries,
the big industries stay on the

00:29:11.143 --> 00:29:11.640
outside.
 

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.558
That's where your labor force
lives.

00:29:13.558 --> 00:29:16.630
How different that is than
Philadelphia or Detroit,

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.304
where you already had all this
space and you've got the

00:29:19.304 --> 00:29:22.028
population moving into big
central areas and essentially

00:29:22.028 --> 00:29:22.920
staying there.
 

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.538
To be sure, in the United
States, we have places like a

00:29:26.538 --> 00:29:28.750
very small part of New Orleans.
 

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:29.900
You've got San Francisco.
 

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.349
You've got Beacon Hill.
 

00:29:31.349 --> 00:29:32.588
You've got Manhattan.
 

00:29:32.588 --> 00:29:35.519
You've got places where you've
got a lot of wealthy people

00:29:35.519 --> 00:29:36.960
living in the center city.
 

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.325
But places like Detroit are
more really common of the

00:29:40.325 --> 00:29:41.750
American experience.
 

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.029
Next, please.
 

00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:47.888
I can remember when I was a
kid, when I was younger than

00:29:47.888 --> 00:29:50.414
you, I think,
going to a Yankee-Tiger

00:29:50.414 --> 00:29:52.170
doubleheader in 1967.
 

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.400
Roy Whit played third base.
 

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:58.178
We walked out and the city of
Detroit was on fire because of

00:29:58.178 --> 00:29:59.150
the riots.
 

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.118
It's still all burned out there.
 

00:30:02.118 --> 00:30:03.934
One of the interesting things
was Grosse Pointe,

00:30:03.934 --> 00:30:05.480
Michigan, which is a very fancy
place.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.618
We have a lot of students here
from Grosse Pointe.

00:30:07.618 --> 00:30:10.328
I'm not dissing Grosse Pointe,
Michigan,

00:30:10.328 --> 00:30:12.288
but the municipal council tried
to figure out a way that you

00:30:12.288 --> 00:30:14.115
couldn't get to Grosse Pointe
from the center of Detroit

00:30:14.115 --> 00:30:16.239
unless you had a map,
unless you really knew how to

00:30:16.239 --> 00:30:18.019
get there to try to keep
"them,"

00:30:18.019 --> 00:30:19.910
that is,
the poor people of the center,

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.000
from going to the suburbs.
 

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.179
The upper classes of Grosse
Pointe armed themselves with

00:30:25.179 --> 00:30:28.978
their hunting rifles,
just as the constables had in

00:30:28.978 --> 00:30:31.028
central London in 1848.
 

00:30:31.028 --> 00:30:33.829
The spatial juxtaposition is
incredible.

00:30:33.829 --> 00:30:34.359
Next.
 

00:30:34.359 --> 00:30:35.068
Oh, here we go.
 

00:30:35.068 --> 00:30:36.509
Those were lots of people in
the center.

00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:39.548
The theme here is overcrowding.
 

00:30:39.548 --> 00:30:42.098
Here is the Market of the
Innocents, which it's called.

00:30:42.098 --> 00:30:44.079
Now it's down by the forum Les
Halles.

00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:45.618
Lots of people.
 

00:30:45.618 --> 00:30:49.049
Then the big market Haussman
built would later be torn down.

00:30:49.049 --> 00:30:50.210
Lots of people in the middle.
 

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.819
That's a theme.
 

00:30:50.819 --> 00:30:53.089
Next, please.
 

00:30:53.089 --> 00:30:54.140
The Rue Pirouette in 1860.
 

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.900
These are really old medieval
buildings.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.009
A lot of them get destroyed by
the rebuilding.

00:31:00.009 --> 00:31:02.660
Next, please.
 

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.930
Violà,
this is a good one.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.190
This is one of the streets that
would disappear.

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.303
You could say,
"What the hell is he

00:31:07.303 --> 00:31:07.759
talking about?
 

00:31:07.759 --> 00:31:09.250
Where are all those
people?"

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.788
If you have really good eyes,
you can see that there are a

00:31:11.788 --> 00:31:13.284
few people here,
because of these long

00:31:13.284 --> 00:31:14.961
exposures,
there's actually some people

00:31:14.961 --> 00:31:15.608
standing there.
 

00:31:15.608 --> 00:31:18.628
This had already been condemned
to be destroyed,

00:31:18.628 --> 00:31:20.750
rather like the Rue Transonain.
 

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.329
It had part of the collective
memory of the massacre there.

00:31:23.329 --> 00:31:24.920
What is this in the center?
 

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.200
It's a ditch down where sewage
went.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.390
There were some sewers in
Paris, but it was very

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:29.950
unhealthy.
 

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:32.590
In these areas,
this is right near the

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:35.805
Panthéon,
that is sort of in the center

00:31:35.805 --> 00:31:38.088
left, eastern part of Paris.
 

00:31:38.088 --> 00:31:42.703
People just get destroyed by
the cholera in 1832,

00:31:42.703 --> 00:31:46.645
and again in 1849,
and again in the 1880s,

00:31:46.645 --> 00:31:47.798
in 1884.
 

00:31:47.798 --> 00:31:53.348
Fundamental inequality before
death of the poor.

00:31:53.348 --> 00:31:56.170
This street--this is actually a
great photo.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.531
This is by a guy called Charles
Marville, who went around and

00:31:58.531 --> 00:32:00.657
took pictures of these
neighborhoods that were going to

00:32:00.657 --> 00:32:01.210
disappear.
 

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.130
Don't worry about the names.
 

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:03.380
Don't worry about the streets.
 

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.130
I'm trying just to make a point.
 

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.519
Not everybody lived on those
streets.

00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:10.518
In the second empire,
that is 1852-1870,

00:32:10.518 --> 00:32:13.210
Napoleon III,
people lived it up.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:17.088
A lot of Zola's novels are
really amazing about that.

00:32:17.088 --> 00:32:20.210
He didn't like Louis Napoleon
terribly much.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:24.269
This is living it up in a big
banquet in a big hotel.

00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:26.098
Already you can see the wine
glasses.

00:32:26.098 --> 00:32:28.898
They're starting to put the
wine glasses in connection with

00:32:28.898 --> 00:32:29.430
the food.
 

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.705
That's something that comes in
the nineteenth century,

00:32:31.705 --> 00:32:33.509
the idea of having red wine
with cheese.

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:35.338
You do have white wine with
goat's cheese.

00:32:35.338 --> 00:32:40.171
Or having white wine with--most
with fish and fowl and that kind

00:32:40.171 --> 00:32:44.005
of thing, and these long,
elaborate banquets of one

00:32:44.005 --> 00:32:46.230
course following another.
 

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:48.307
I can hardly condemn that,
having sat through a few

00:32:48.307 --> 00:32:49.390
thousand of them myself.
 

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:50.799
Anyway, there we go.
 

00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:52.670
Fancy people.
 

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.410
Next, please.
 

00:32:55.410 --> 00:33:01.278
This is revolution in 1830.
 

00:33:01.278 --> 00:33:03.799
The bourgeois guy doesn't
belong there.

00:33:03.799 --> 00:33:05.788
He never went out there anyway.
 

00:33:05.788 --> 00:33:08.720
Marianne--this is a highly
romantic view of death.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.160
Here's your street urchin
there, who's fighting the good

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:11.868
fight in 1830.
 

00:33:11.868 --> 00:33:14.144
This is Delacroix's famous
Liberty Leading the

00:33:14.144 --> 00:33:14.759
People.
 

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:17.328
This is an enormous painting.
 

00:33:17.328 --> 00:33:19.440
These people look like they're
kind of playacting.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.338
They're kind of saying,
"Oh, I'm dead now."

00:33:21.338 --> 00:33:23.609
A few minutes later they're
going to get up again.

00:33:23.609 --> 00:33:24.420
This is very romanticized.
 

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.230
Next, please.
 

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.240
Compare this to Meissonier.
 

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.109
This is a very underappreciated
painting.

00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:32.348
Again, the name doesn't matter.
 

00:33:32.348 --> 00:33:34.750
It meant something to him and
it does to art people,

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.730
but this is called The
Barricade.

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.750
This is only eighteen years
later.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:40.890
This is 1848.
 

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.279
This is real death.
 

00:33:42.279 --> 00:33:43.338
These are ordinary people.
 

00:33:43.338 --> 00:33:47.548
Again, look at the gray-green,
the sick corridors.

00:33:47.548 --> 00:33:52.355
This is an affectionate look at
people who are dying for a good

00:33:52.355 --> 00:33:54.759
cause in the center of Paris.
 

00:33:54.759 --> 00:33:56.131
Louis Napoleon,
Napoleon III,

00:33:56.131 --> 00:33:57.650
didn't want revolution again.
 

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:01.450
Since there were barricades in
so many of these revolutions,

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:05.349
barricades begin on the day of
the barricades in Paris in 1572,

00:34:05.349 --> 00:34:07.528
or something like that,
before this course stokes up.

00:34:07.528 --> 00:34:11.342
He said, "Let's build the
boulevards so wide that you

00:34:11.342 --> 00:34:14.219
can't build barricades across
them."

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:20.494
In 1944 and in 1968 barricades
were in the same places,

00:34:20.494 --> 00:34:27.465
often, where the revolutionary
barricades had been in 1789 or

00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:29.789
in 1848 or 1871.
 

00:34:29.789 --> 00:34:33.130
These guys, that's Napoleon,
the guy with the pen.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:36.617
That's Haussmann,
who was born in Paris but had

00:34:36.617 --> 00:34:38.059
Alsacian parents.
 

00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:42.079
He's in the middle.
 

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:44.460
Louis Napoleon flops a map down
and says,

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.023
"Build big boulevards
through this teeming city,"

00:34:48.023 --> 00:34:50.849
"teeming"
used for the third time.

00:34:50.849 --> 00:34:52.849
He does that for three reasons.
 

00:34:52.849 --> 00:34:54.719
One, two, three.
 

00:34:54.719 --> 00:35:00.318
One, to bring more air into
Paris, more boulevards with

00:35:00.318 --> 00:35:02.909
sewers underneath them.
 

00:35:02.909 --> 00:35:05.824
Boulevards mean better
transportation,

00:35:05.824 --> 00:35:06.849
more light.
 

00:35:06.849 --> 00:35:11.679
Secondly, he does this to
increase the flow of capital.

00:35:11.679 --> 00:35:14.266
It's not a coincidence that
department stores are built on

00:35:14.266 --> 00:35:15.130
these boulevards.
 

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.619
Some of the ones are still
there.

00:35:17.619 --> 00:35:20.670
The shopkeepers not near
department store got wiped out.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.530
They were really mad.
 

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:24.894
Very extreme rightwing voting
at the end of the nineteenth

00:35:24.894 --> 00:35:25.309
century.
 

00:35:25.309 --> 00:35:27.809
The ones near the department
stores do very well.

00:35:27.809 --> 00:35:32.172
Third, and he says it in
Haussmann's memoirs,

00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:37.032
Louis Napoleon wants these
built so you can't have

00:35:37.032 --> 00:35:38.518
barricades.
 

00:35:38.518 --> 00:35:41.400
He builds these boulevards
around and through the

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.440
traditional revolutionary areas.
 

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.170
The result is lots of people
pack up and they leave.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:46.840
Next.
 

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.349
We're going to go through the
next ones fairly quickly.

00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:52.630
Here's Paris 1855.
 

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.438
Belleville up there,
or La Villette,

00:35:55.438 --> 00:35:59.369
or Montmartre there,
which has a god-awful church,

00:35:59.369 --> 00:36:03.139
Sacré-Coeur,
built on it after 1871.

00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:07.199
Those were annexed as suburbs
in 1860.

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:10.280
It's inner suburbs annexed into
Paris.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.969
This wall here is the limit of
Paris today.

00:36:14.969 --> 00:36:18.795
You still have people farming
in Vaugirard and these places,

00:36:18.795 --> 00:36:19.510
Grenelle.
 

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.159
All that will stop.
 

00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:24.849
By 1870 this is all sort of
packed with people.

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:28.438
The people living in
Belleville, which is on a hill,

00:36:28.438 --> 00:36:32.239
were people many of whom were
forced out of the central

00:36:32.239 --> 00:36:34.139
quarters by high rents.
 

00:36:34.139 --> 00:36:37.159
They are the ones perched
dangerously, from the point of

00:36:37.159 --> 00:36:39.300
view of the center,
on the periphery.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.755
Ironically, as the middle
classes move further and further

00:36:42.755 --> 00:36:45.969
west, they lost their contact
with ordinary people.

00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:48.501
A lot of the stuff they're
reading is based upon--they

00:36:48.501 --> 00:36:50.460
don't really see those people up
there.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.952
Maybe they walk down the hill,
they can't afford to take the

00:36:53.952 --> 00:36:56.498
horse-drawn carriages,
the omnibuses,

00:36:56.498 --> 00:36:58.570
to be servants in their houses.
 

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.170
These spatial things are very
interesting.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:03.880
You find them in other cities,
too.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.313
Here, they take the map and
they say, "Let's build

00:37:06.313 --> 00:37:07.170
boulevards."
 

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.478
You don't have to know anything
about Paris to know that there

00:37:10.478 --> 00:37:12.920
wasn't any north-south--;north
is up there;

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.599
south is down toward
me--;thoroughfare,

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:16.840
and they built Boulevard Saint
Michel,

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.682
Boulevard Strasbourg,
Boulevard Saint Denis that goes

00:37:19.682 --> 00:37:22.750
up to the station of the east
with the station of the north,

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.289
right to the left.
 

00:37:24.289 --> 00:37:27.454
Étoile,
up here, the boulevards help

00:37:27.454 --> 00:37:29.940
create the kind of star notion.
 

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.250
Étoile means star.
 

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:35.333
It looks like a star around the
Arc de Triomphe and the big

00:37:35.333 --> 00:37:39.489
grand crossing that I'll show
you in a minute that gives you

00:37:39.489 --> 00:37:44.550
the west-east access,
as well as some other ones, too.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.039
They do a lot of building.
 

00:37:46.039 --> 00:37:47.690
They knock down a whole hill.
 

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.222
This is now where the Palace of
Trocadéro is,

00:37:50.222 --> 00:37:53.204
lots of work employing lots of
people, so the housing workers

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:53.900
like them.
 

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:58.438
In 1855, let's look at--you're
walking through the Gallery of

00:37:58.438 --> 00:38:01.389
Machines at one of these world
fairs.

00:38:01.389 --> 00:38:05.231
Because Victoria had one in
1851, Louis Napoleon's got to

00:38:05.231 --> 00:38:06.329
have one, too.
 

00:38:06.329 --> 00:38:07.070
He has two.
 

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:10.969
He has one in 1855 and another
one in 1866 or 1867.

00:38:10.969 --> 00:38:12.219
You're walking along here.
 

00:38:12.219 --> 00:38:13.719
You can look at paintings.
 

00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:15.719
Above all, you can look at
machines.

00:38:15.719 --> 00:38:17.719
You can look at things you can
buy.

00:38:17.719 --> 00:38:19.860
That's the principle of these
expositions.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.909
Paris is on stage.
 

00:38:21.909 --> 00:38:24.090
That's the principle of a
department store.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:28.284
You can walk through a
department store and you can buy

00:38:28.284 --> 00:38:32.943
forty-nine different kinds of
shawls, ranging from very cheap

00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:35.429
ones to very expensive ones.
 

00:38:35.429 --> 00:38:36.659
It's the same principle.
 

00:38:36.659 --> 00:38:40.789
The boulevards are really an
extension of,

00:38:40.789 --> 00:38:43.443
as my friend Phillip Nord once
argued and so have a lot of

00:38:43.443 --> 00:38:46.791
other people,
these department stores

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:48.150
themselves.
 

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:51.155
They become sort of a staging
area for what became known as

00:38:51.155 --> 00:38:52.139
the Belle Epoque.
 

00:38:52.139 --> 00:38:54.643
It wasn't so belle for
people who didn't have any

00:38:54.643 --> 00:38:56.829
money, because those were hard
economic times.

00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:59.539
These department stores still
exist.

00:38:59.539 --> 00:39:03.110
The BHV, the Bazaar de l'Hotel
de Ville still exists in Paris.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.000
Bon Marché.
 

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.952
There's a terrific book on Bon
Marché

00:39:05.952 --> 00:39:06.860
by Michael Miller.
 

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.880
It's still there.
 

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.869
Zola called them "the
cathedrals of modernity."

00:39:11.869 --> 00:39:15.367
Already in the 1850s they had
singing groups singing Christmas

00:39:15.367 --> 00:39:16.630
carols at Christmas.
 

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.150
People would come.
 

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.425
They couldn't afford to buy
anything and just be part of the

00:39:20.425 --> 00:39:20.889
spectacle.
 

00:39:20.889 --> 00:39:23.219
Paris became a spectacle in
itself.

00:39:23.219 --> 00:39:26.550
The boulevards were part of
this.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:30.547
These aren't very good prints,
but he was so important he

00:39:30.547 --> 00:39:34.190
became-to haussmann
something was to bulldoze

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.690
it.
 

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.844
Maybe to "Merriman"
something would be to drink a

00:39:36.844 --> 00:39:38.480
good bottle of Côtes du
Rhône.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.760
Maybe one day that will be mine.
 

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.579
Maybe I'll get a French verb.
 

00:39:42.579 --> 00:39:43.980
I'm just kidding.
 

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:49.059
But anyway, haussmannisation
is to bulldoze something.

00:39:49.059 --> 00:39:52.159
This is called the
haussmannisation of a

00:39:52.159 --> 00:39:53.170
neighborhood.
 

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.389
Here, these people are getting
the equivalent of about ten

00:39:55.389 --> 00:39:56.869
dollars, forced out of their
houses.

00:39:56.869 --> 00:39:58.079
They've got their dog.
 

00:39:58.079 --> 00:39:59.590
They've got everything they own
there.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:00.610
Look at the mattress.
 

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.340
A mattress is the last thing
you ever pawned.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.409
There's the mattress.
 

00:40:03.409 --> 00:40:04.280
They're leaving.
 

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.889
The next one, please.
 

00:40:05.889 --> 00:40:08.659
This is called Haussmann
Part II.

00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:11.039
Here you've got your
Haussmannian vista.

00:40:11.039 --> 00:40:16.164
You've got the big boulevards
with all these not then so fancy

00:40:16.164 --> 00:40:17.760
balcony railings.
 

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.989
The real fancy ones come later
in the Third Republic.

00:40:20.989 --> 00:40:23.070
This is really St. Augustine.
 

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:23.880
It's a hideous church.
 

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.920
Some people really like it.
 

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.871
My dear friend Bob Herbert
thinks it's not bad,

00:40:26.871 --> 00:40:27.719
the art historian.
 

00:40:27.719 --> 00:40:30.780
This is haussmannisation
of a corridor,

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.820
part two, of a neighborhood.
 

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.579
Next, please.
 

00:40:34.579 --> 00:40:35.760
You've got people building.
 

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.789
That's the Tour Saint-Jacques,
which is still there.

00:40:37.789 --> 00:40:40.353
A lot of these are little teeny
people who are from the center

00:40:40.353 --> 00:40:41.739
part of France or the builders.
 

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:43.880
Everybody's aware of this
building.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.590
Here you can say,
"How are we going to get

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:48.949
from Point 1,
which is down by the Seine,

00:40:48.949 --> 00:40:51.719
the Rue de Rivoli,
which has been expanded?

00:40:51.719 --> 00:40:54.139
How do you get to this new
opera they're building?"

00:40:54.139 --> 00:40:57.293
First you tip off your friends
so they make a lot of money on

00:40:57.293 --> 00:40:59.869
the deal, knowing what to sell
and what to buy.

00:40:59.869 --> 00:41:01.570
Then you take a ruler.
 

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.400
You didn't have to be an
architectural genius.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.280
You draw a straight line.
 

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.978
That's what I mean by
"imperialism of the

00:41:05.978 --> 00:41:06.809
straight line."
 

00:41:06.809 --> 00:41:08.050
Next, please.
 

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.199
You're getting to the opera.
 

00:41:09.199 --> 00:41:12.039
There you can see it rising up,
Garnier's opera.

00:41:12.039 --> 00:41:15.965
It rises up out of the smoke,
out of the cloud of

00:41:15.965 --> 00:41:17.110
destruction.
 

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:17.900
I'm getting carried away.
 

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.409
Next, please.
 

00:41:19.409 --> 00:41:21.250
There it's being built.
 

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:24.059
There it is.
 

00:41:24.059 --> 00:41:27.010
You are here looking at what
now is the largest concentration

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:28.929
of pickpockets in the western
world,

00:41:28.929 --> 00:41:30.960
because there's an American
Express right near there.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.340
You see all these Americans.
 

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.199
They've got their big wallets.
 

00:41:32.199 --> 00:41:33.782
They say, "Where's the
American Express,

00:41:33.782 --> 00:41:34.250
dear?"
 

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:35.230
It's right over here.
 

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:35.570
Voop!
 

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:38.443
Their wallets are out of there
before they hit the top step of

00:41:38.443 --> 00:41:39.340
the Métro.
 

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.380
That baby's gone.
 

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:48.190
Anyway, that's the Place
Vendôme down there.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.550
Next, please.
 

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.739
There it is in 1900.
 

00:41:51.739 --> 00:41:53.980
Here again, imperialism in a
straight line.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:59.398
There you've got--maybe I'll do
a thing on blowing up this

00:41:59.398 --> 00:42:00.920
building here.
 

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.659
Sometime we'll come back to
this maybe.

00:42:03.659 --> 00:42:07.500
Anyway, there you go.
 

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.860
Here's the great crossing in
the center of Paris.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:13.320
This is--you're crossing from
Ile of Cité

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.309
here and you're going up.
 

00:42:15.309 --> 00:42:17.909
Here's the Gare de l"Est,
the station of the east there.

00:42:17.909 --> 00:42:20.420
This way you're looking down
east.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.929
There's the Tour Saint Jacques.
 

00:42:22.929 --> 00:42:26.768
The only point is that they
expand this down toward Saint

00:42:26.768 --> 00:42:29.989
Antoine and the Faubourg Saint
Antoine where the

00:42:29.989 --> 00:42:34.719
revolutionaries were in 1848,
and where they were in 1789,

00:42:34.719 --> 00:42:37.018
and where they were in 1792,
as well,

00:42:37.018 --> 00:42:38.590
and at other times in the
French Revolution,

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.230
1830 for example.
 

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:41.329
They're down there.
 

00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:44.182
That's the big crossing point,
la grande

00:42:44.182 --> 00:42:45.610
croisée.
 

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:46.550
There's the Gare de l'Est.
 

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.380
When I see that station it's so
sad.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:53.108
That's where all the people
drinking champagne went in 1914

00:42:53.108 --> 00:42:56.130
shouting, "À
Berlin."

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.949
Just as in Hauptbahnhof,
in Berlin they were shouting

00:42:58.949 --> 00:43:00.739
"Nacht Paris."
 

00:43:00.739 --> 00:43:01.699
Of course, they don't come back.
 

00:43:01.699 --> 00:43:05.329
So many Jews were deported from
here,

00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:08.300
if they were sent from the
Galle du Nord to Drancy,

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.307
if they were on the direct line
to Auschwitz or the other death

00:43:10.307 --> 00:43:12.929
camps,
they went through this station.

00:43:12.929 --> 00:43:14.630
Next.
 

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:18.849
Arrested by French police,
1942-1943.

00:43:18.849 --> 00:43:22.059
He builds Les Halles,
the big market.

00:43:22.059 --> 00:43:25.623
My friend Vincent Scully,
who teaches in here afterward,

00:43:25.623 --> 00:43:29.121
he would do a better job on
this, but I do remember the

00:43:29.121 --> 00:43:31.389
first time I was ever in Paris.
 

00:43:31.389 --> 00:43:33.820
I don't know how old I was.
 

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.751
Younger than I once was and
than I am now,

00:43:36.751 --> 00:43:40.400
or younger than I'll be,
or whatever the line is.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.780
I met somebody on a bus in
Germany.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:47.038
She was a sculpturess and she
kindly invited me to stay in her

00:43:47.038 --> 00:43:47.679
apartment.
 

00:43:47.679 --> 00:43:49.489
It was all on the up and up.
 

00:43:49.489 --> 00:43:50.199
It was no problem.
 

00:43:50.199 --> 00:43:52.849
She took me down in the middle
of the night to see this place,

00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:55.597
and to see the restaurants
where you'd see the wealthy

00:43:55.597 --> 00:43:58.103
people eating,
and the butchers with their

00:43:58.103 --> 00:44:01.650
smocks covered with Beaujolais
and also with animal blood.

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:02.670
It was really cool.
 

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:03.590
Then they tore this down.
 

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.942
They tore it down to build a
whole bunch of unsuccessful

00:44:06.942 --> 00:44:09.989
places and the filthy
destruction of a monument.

00:44:09.989 --> 00:44:12.300
We need Vince Scully here to do
this.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.880
People chain themselves to
these things.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.554
They say, "Can't you leave
just one so you people would

00:44:16.554 --> 00:44:17.780
know what these are like?
 

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:18.768
Can't you leave just one?"
 

00:44:18.768 --> 00:44:20.539
They said, "No,
we can make some money here.

00:44:20.539 --> 00:44:24.460
We can get in--soon we'll have
McDonald's all over the place.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.690
We'll make some money."
 

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:27.219
They got rid of them and
there's none of them left.

00:44:27.219 --> 00:44:27.730
It's a tragedy.
 

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:28.940
Haussmann built those.
 

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.280
I'm not a big Haussmann guy.
 

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.559
Here's a building with more
Third Republic.

00:44:34.559 --> 00:44:36.849
These are the buildings that he
built along the boulevards.

00:44:36.849 --> 00:44:38.349
Next, please.
 

00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:39.429
I've got to rocket on.
 

00:44:39.429 --> 00:44:42.007
If you follow art history you
know there's a very famous

00:44:42.007 --> 00:44:44.400
painting by Caillebotte that
shows the anonymity.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.289
It's called Paris with the
Effect of Rain.

00:44:47.289 --> 00:44:50.396
It's right here on this place,
which is where two boulevards

00:44:50.396 --> 00:44:51.239
come together.
 

00:44:51.239 --> 00:44:52.739
That's part of the thing, too.
 

00:44:52.739 --> 00:44:54.489
You've got your basic middle
class people.

00:44:54.489 --> 00:44:55.900
They were carrying umbrellas.
 

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.380
They are disconnected.
 

00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:58.929
They would never say hello to
each other,

00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:02.248
and they're crossing this
intersection that becomes part

00:45:02.248 --> 00:45:05.340
of the heartbeat of urban life,
or something dramatic like that.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.409
Next, please.
 

00:45:06.409 --> 00:45:08.260
You've got these boulevards.
 

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.768
This already existed,
because it was where the walls

00:45:11.768 --> 00:45:12.869
had once been.
 

00:45:12.869 --> 00:45:14.130
This is the Boulevard
Montmartre.

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:16.590
Next, please.
 

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:17.789
Oh, man.
 

00:45:17.789 --> 00:45:19.239
There was supposed to be
another one there.

00:45:19.239 --> 00:45:19.960
Anyway, no problem.
 

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.590
My bad.
 

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:23.315
If you were flying around
overhead, you would look down

00:45:23.315 --> 00:45:23.670
here.
 

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:25.079
Here is Notre Dame.
 

00:45:25.079 --> 00:45:27.119
There's Les Halles up in that
direction.

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:28.840
That's the church of Saint
Sulpice.

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.800
You see the big crossing
points, the big boulevards that

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.768
have been built.
 

00:45:32.768 --> 00:45:35.621
Here's the big old crossing
point there, the Tour Saint

00:45:35.621 --> 00:45:36.150
Jacques.
 

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:38.610
A bird's eye view of all of
this.

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:42.739
What I left out was Camille
Pissarro's image from that same

00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:44.518
point where he painted.
 

00:45:44.518 --> 00:45:47.461
An impressionist painted
because of their interest in

00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:49.670
light and first view and all of
that.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:51.489
There's a lot of important
paintings of this.

00:45:51.489 --> 00:45:53.820
Renoir didn't like these
boulevards.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:57.860
He said they're lined up like
troops at a review.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.717
That's the most appropriate
image of the centralization of

00:46:00.717 --> 00:46:01.420
state power.
 

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.985
Speaking of state power,
what happens in the Paris

00:46:04.985 --> 00:46:09.204
Commune in 1871 is that ordinary
people in Paris take arms,

00:46:09.204 --> 00:46:10.369
as you know.
 

00:46:10.369 --> 00:46:12.690
They build barricades across
these places.

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:15.340
Next, please.
 

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.380
Then the troops of the
provisional government from

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.980
Versailles,
appropriately enough,

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.710
come in and they use these same
boulevards,

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.329
the extension of the Rue de
Rivoli,

00:46:26.329 --> 00:46:27.224
the Rue St.
 

00:46:27.224 --> 00:46:30.724
Antoine, to go and gun down
ordinary people,

00:46:30.724 --> 00:46:32.190
25,000 of them.
 

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.579
Welcome to the twentieth
century in 1871,

00:46:34.579 --> 00:46:37.030
when you were guilty for whom
you were.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:38.099
"À
Paris tout le monde

00:46:38.099 --> 00:46:39.110
était coupable."
 

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:40.911
"In Paris everybody was
guilty,"

00:46:40.911 --> 00:46:42.230
said a prosecuting attorney.
 

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.980
Next, please.
 

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:45.320
But the spatial aspects of this
are important.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.159
This is right.
 

00:46:46.159 --> 00:46:47.380
That's the Madeleine.
 

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.018
There's just a lot of
destruction.

00:46:50.018 --> 00:46:54.969
Here's Manet's depiction of
women being shot.

00:46:54.969 --> 00:46:58.731
There were these images of
rumors that women incendiaries

00:46:58.731 --> 00:47:02.630
were burning down the wealthy
buildings of the property.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:05.268
Les pétroleuses,
the female incendiaries.

00:47:05.268 --> 00:47:07.159
Manet did one and so did
Courbet.

00:47:07.159 --> 00:47:09.909
Next, please.
 

00:47:09.909 --> 00:47:13.119
Finally, that's real death.
 

00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:18.016
Those are rather small people
in tiny caskets who have just

00:47:18.016 --> 00:47:21.985
been mowed down because they
were who they were,

00:47:21.985 --> 00:47:25.280
that is poor and in people's
Paris.

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.394
They systematically targeted
areas like Belleville,

00:47:28.394 --> 00:47:31.199
because they were identified
with the left.

00:47:31.199 --> 00:47:34.411
If we could speed through these
next few, then we'll be out of

00:47:34.411 --> 00:47:34.780
here.
 

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.449
Next, please.
 

00:47:36.449 --> 00:47:39.530
Here again, those are the
boulevards with the old gates.

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:43.929
Here's what I mean by east-west.
 

00:47:43.929 --> 00:47:47.768
In the northwestern part of
Paris people were moving into

00:47:47.768 --> 00:47:49.690
slightly better buildings.
 

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:53.331
In the northeast,
more rural looking ones just on

00:47:53.331 --> 00:47:56.139
the outside, the laundry of
combat.

00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:58.460
We know this is after 1900,
because there's a reference to

00:47:58.460 --> 00:47:58.949
the metro.
 

00:47:58.949 --> 00:48:00.518
The metro didn't open until
1900.

00:48:00.518 --> 00:48:03.260
So, this is probably about
1912, actually there.

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:09.699
People on the periphery coming
in to pawn their mattresses.

00:48:09.699 --> 00:48:12.070
Here's the gates when you were
outside.

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:14.007
Again, why are all the
factories on the outside,

00:48:14.007 --> 00:48:15.079
all the ordinary people?
 

00:48:15.079 --> 00:48:16.679
Because life was cheaper out
there.

00:48:16.679 --> 00:48:19.257
That's why beyond Montparnasse
are all these café

00:48:19.257 --> 00:48:21.039
areas that are still in Paris,
now,

00:48:21.039 --> 00:48:23.510
but were once out there,
because it was cheaper to be

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:24.030
out there.
 

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:26.380
At the end of her sad,
short, drunken life,

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.347
Gervaise in L'Assommoir
goes out to hook on the

00:48:29.347 --> 00:48:31.139
periphery, on the boulevard.
 

00:48:31.139 --> 00:48:32.329
She gets poorer and poorer.
 

00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:35.878
Zola was so well aware of the
spatial concomitants of all of

00:48:35.878 --> 00:48:36.300
this.
 

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.199
This is what it was like
passing through the barrier.

00:48:39.199 --> 00:48:42.489
It's outside that the red belt
exists.

00:48:42.489 --> 00:48:44.059
It's outside of all.
 

00:48:44.059 --> 00:48:46.090
Vienna is a classic example.
 

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.862
In the 1930s you've got the
army blasting,

00:48:48.862 --> 00:48:52.786
firing cannons against the
working-class housing perched on

00:48:52.786 --> 00:48:54.409
the outside of town.
 

00:48:54.409 --> 00:48:56.213
"Sires,"
said one of the ministers to

00:48:56.213 --> 00:48:58.449
Louis Philippe,
"those usines,

00:48:58.449 --> 00:49:01.956
those factories that you are
allowing to be built around

00:49:01.956 --> 00:49:04.472
Paris,
on the outskirts will be the

00:49:04.472 --> 00:49:07.110
cord that strangles us one
day."

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:11.586
It's on the outskirts in these
industrial suburbs that had once

00:49:11.586 --> 00:49:15.485
been producing cherries for the
urban market and fruit,

00:49:15.485 --> 00:49:17.869
but now were their factories.
 

00:49:17.869 --> 00:49:21.275
It's there that the Communist
party did so well in the 1920s

00:49:21.275 --> 00:49:22.949
and 1930s, and even beyond.
 

00:49:22.949 --> 00:49:24.760
They provided social services.
 

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.449
They defended people.
 

00:49:26.449 --> 00:49:28.688
They were called the mal
lotis, people that had

00:49:28.688 --> 00:49:30.000
inappropriate places to live.
 

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.822
So that, again,
was what I meant by center

00:49:32.822 --> 00:49:37.019
versus periphery and the sense
of not belonging to the center,

00:49:37.019 --> 00:49:39.429
of not belonging to the center.
 

00:49:39.429 --> 00:49:43.259
You see the same thing with
people living inside of American

00:49:43.259 --> 00:49:45.920
cities, of not belonging to
prosperity.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:49.713
It can contribute to a
formation of a counter-society,

00:49:49.713 --> 00:49:53.652
of kind of a sense of not
belonging that creates a sense

00:49:53.652 --> 00:49:54.869
of belonging.
 

00:49:54.869 --> 00:49:58.860
As we are rejected,
we too can become powerful.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.880
The spatial aspects of this are
terribly important.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:05.659
Look at the riots in the
suburbs in 2005.

00:50:05.659 --> 00:50:08.317
We don't have time to talk
about that, but that's a

00:50:08.317 --> 00:50:09.380
fascinating thing.
 

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:12.141
Different people who are
marginalized by the center,

00:50:12.141 --> 00:50:15.228
large populations of North
Africans, and of West Africans,

00:50:15.228 --> 00:50:17.070
and people from the Caribbean.
 

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:20.336
It's the same phenomenon,
the center and periphery is

00:50:20.336 --> 00:50:20.840
there.
 

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:25.922
Last, and I think I've pulled
it off, if you went westward,

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:27.500
this is a Monet.
 

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:30.309
This is one of the many
regattas at Angers.

00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:33.150
You went westward for pleasure,
not eastward.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:36.518
You went further and further so
the middle classes,

00:50:36.518 --> 00:50:38.050
particularly in the western
part of Paris,

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:43.309
plant their flag defiantly in
Normandy, in Deauville,

00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:47.079
and in Angoville and all of
these places there.

00:50:47.079 --> 00:50:50.943
It's there that the
impressionists paint the

00:50:50.943 --> 00:50:55.286
Parisian upper classes,
who when you go to Deauville

00:50:55.286 --> 00:50:59.512
you still see all the 75 license
plates and the 78s from the

00:50:59.512 --> 00:51:00.659
Paris region.
 

00:51:00.659 --> 00:51:01.530
It's still the place.
 

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:04.739
There's a social geography of
leisure, too,

00:51:04.739 --> 00:51:08.639
that develops in Paris,
as in these other cities.

00:51:08.639 --> 00:51:12.119
It happens so remarkably in
what was not only the bourgeois

00:51:12.119 --> 00:51:14.291
century,
not only the rebellious

00:51:14.291 --> 00:51:16.210
century,
but above all,

00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:20.726
the urban century where the way
in which people lived in very

00:51:20.726 --> 00:51:23.210
important ways was transformed.
 

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:24.000
Thank you very much.
 

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.039
Good luck on the midterm.
 

00:51:25.039 --> 00:51:26.449
See you next week.
 

00:51:26.449 --> 00:51:28.619
See you on Wednesday.

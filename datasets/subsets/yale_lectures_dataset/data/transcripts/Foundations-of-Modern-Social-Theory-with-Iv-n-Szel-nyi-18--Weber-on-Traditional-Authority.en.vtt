00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.301
Prof: Well,
I would like very briefly to

00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:07.230
come back to Weber's theory of
domination.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.160
I deleted it from the
questions, but I promise I will

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.470
get this back in one way or
another for the next test.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.316
So probably the last thing you
want to think about now is a

00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:23.240
test &gt;
 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.780
, but let me still talk about
the theory of domination.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.922
I think this is a very
important theory--extremely

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:35.220
influential and extremely
insightful.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.248
So let me just very briefly sum
up where we left it last time,

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:45.690
and then I'll move into Weber's
theory of traditional authority.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.188
And last time we were talking
about the crucial distinction

00:00:50.188 --> 00:00:54.610
Weber makes between Macht
and Herrschaft.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.380
Macht is translated in
English as power;

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.070
there is no question about this.
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.250
The translation of
Herrschaft varies.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.060
It is translated either as
authority, or it is translated

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.718
as domination.
 

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:17.239
And I think both translations
are good.

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:25.805
I think, people whom I feel
closer in my own Weber reading,

00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:32.452
translated it more like
domination rather than

00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:34.519
authority.
 

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:37.884
And, in fact,
I think just to emphasize you

00:01:37.884 --> 00:01:41.890
the importance of the
translational difference,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.930
in the notion of
Herrschaft,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.739
the first four letters,
Herr,

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:49.569
means the lord.
 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.277
So I think the notion of
herrschaft has very strong

00:01:54.277 --> 00:01:59.080
implications of asymmetrical
power relationships;

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.980
what I think domination
captures better than authority.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.366
Those who translated Weber's
notion of Herrschaft as

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:12.770
authority,
like Talcott Parsons,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.573
wanted to emphasize that Weber
looks at Herrschaft as

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:23.840
something which is
authoritarian--

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.986
right?--where somebody acts out
of authority.

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:27.560
Right?
 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.610
This is not a false
translation, but misses an

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.783
important point--namely,
Weber's interest in the way how

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:42.038
power is being exercised.
 

00:02:42.038 --> 00:02:47.466
In fact it, in a way,
misses Max Weber's roots in

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:51.649
Friedrich Nietzsche,
or probably even,

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:54.363
I may dare so,
in Hobbes.

00:02:54.363 --> 00:02:55.720
Right?
 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.389
Human history is all about the
history of struggle for power.

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:08.256
That's, in my reading,
Weber's fundamental idea--power

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:11.908
with an important modification.
 

00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:15.752
And I gave you the citation
last lecture,

00:03:15.752 --> 00:03:18.729
but let me come back to this.
 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:24.710
Power means the likelihood that
people will obey order,

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.590
even against resistance.
 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.524
And domination means the
likelihood that people will

00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:38.038
actually follow orders,
without being coerced to do so.

00:03:38.038 --> 00:03:43.590
So the notion of domination,
or Herrschaft,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.840
does imply a degree of
voluntariness,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.182
a minimum level of belief that
in fact those who issue orders

00:03:53.182 --> 00:03:59.395
do have the right to do so;
or at least it is reasonable

00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:04.788
that they issue orders and I
follow the orders.

00:04:04.788 --> 00:04:09.141
Or to come up with an even more
minimal definition of

00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:13.342
Herrschaft,
that I cannot see any real

00:04:13.342 --> 00:04:18.793
alternative under the present
circumstances but to obey the

00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:22.646
orders to the one who issues
these orders.

00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:23.680
Right?
 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.259
And this has everything to do
with the idea of legitimacy.

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:34.267
And I put, at last lecture,
this little

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:41.386
equation--right?--on one of the
slides, that power plus

00:04:41.386 --> 00:04:48.240
legitimation adds up to
domination or authority.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.449
So what is legitimation?
 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.850
Weber said power is really an
extreme case;

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.718
that very little,
very--it happens very rarely

00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:05.778
that the one who exercises
authority, exercises simply by

00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:10.540
exerting power,
coercing people to obey.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.831
Those who are in a position of
authority try to legitimate

00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:22.314
their authority,
and try to come up with reasons

00:05:22.314 --> 00:05:28.319
why people subjected to this
authority should obey their

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:29.740
authority.
 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.620
It's again very Nietzschian,
the idea.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.459
Right?
 

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:40.165
That those who are exercising
power tries to internalize your

00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:44.540
subjugation to power in one way
or another,

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.500
and try to create in you a
morality--

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.600
right?--a set of principles by
which you would say,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.687
"Well, this probably may
be the right thing for me to

00:05:59.687 --> 00:06:00.670
do."
 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.279
Or, as I said,
the minimum definition,

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.807
even if you don't particularly
like obeying orders,

00:06:06.807 --> 00:06:09.490
you say, "What else can I
do?

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.319
The alternative,
if I don't obey orders,

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.990
would be worse."
 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.836
Or about the person who issues
authority: you may not like the

00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:22.492
person who issues authority,
but you will say,

00:06:22.492 --> 00:06:25.930
"But the alternative is
worse." Right?

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.180
So you can pick a course.
 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.362
You may not like the lecturer
all that much,

00:06:33.362 --> 00:06:37.285
or the way how he grades,
but there were other courses

00:06:37.285 --> 00:06:40.690
you did shop for and they were
even worse.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.069
So you picked the least worst
course.

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:44.819
Right?
 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:49.351
You picked the lecturer who
seems to be the least boring,

00:06:49.351 --> 00:06:53.478
and who seems to be the most
reasonable grading your

00:06:53.478 --> 00:06:54.369
assignment.
 

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:55.259
Right?
 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:58.800
That doesn't mean that you are
all that thrilled to be at

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.247
lectures,
and to do assignments,

00:07:01.247 --> 00:07:06.173
but you have to do it,
and under the circumstances you

00:07:06.173 --> 00:07:08.264
go for the less evil.
 

00:07:08.264 --> 00:07:09.060
Right?
 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.488
That's, I think,
the kind of most extreme

00:07:12.488 --> 00:07:16.519
interpretation of Weber's idea
of legitimacy.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:22.708
But Weber also--I pointed this
word out to you--Weber said that

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:27.399
all legitimacy contains an
element of a myth.

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:30.918
It doesn't mean that the person
who tries to justify its

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:33.029
authority is telling the truth.
 

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:37.346
Whether it is truth or not
truth is almost beside the

00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:38.009
point.
 

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:43.887
The most important issue is
that it creates a mythology

00:07:43.887 --> 00:07:49.329
about the reason why you have to
obey authority.

00:07:49.329 --> 00:07:53.170
So what I tried to underline
already in last lecture,

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.031
that Weber's notion of
legitimacy is so much more

00:07:57.031 --> 00:08:00.132
sophisticated,
so less liberal,

00:08:00.132 --> 00:08:06.415
and so much more Nietzschian
than the idea we normally hear

00:08:06.415 --> 00:08:10.208
when you hear the word
legitimation.

00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:11.399
Right?
 

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:14.432
Legitimation,
we see something very good.

00:08:14.432 --> 00:08:15.040
Right?
 

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:21.076
A power is legitimated because
it was somebody was elected in

00:08:21.076 --> 00:08:25.100
fair and free elections to an
office,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.060
and we believe that this person
will do a great job,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.139
having been elected.
 

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:36.777
Well, Weber would be more
likely to think something like

00:08:36.777 --> 00:08:37.700
Karzai.
 

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.336
Well, under the circumstances,
probably there is no

00:08:42.336 --> 00:08:47.250
alternative to Afghanistan but
to have this guy as the

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.548
president.
 

00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:52.533
Though it's very doubtful,
you know, what all those claims

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:56.168
about the legitimacy of the
system are being made;

00:08:56.168 --> 00:09:00.678
they are pretty much a
mythology created around it.

00:09:00.678 --> 00:09:06.648
But otherwise the alternative
is chaos, and even this guy's

00:09:06.648 --> 00:09:12.409
probably better than chaos,
which would happen otherwise.

00:09:12.409 --> 00:09:13.440
Right?
 

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.210
This is in my dark reading of
Max Weber.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.452
Now, as you can see,
of course, the difference from

00:09:22.452 --> 00:09:24.320
Marx is fundamental.
 

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.668
Marx did see human history as
unfolding of modes of

00:09:29.668 --> 00:09:31.058
production.
 

00:09:31.058 --> 00:09:36.484
It was all struggle around
ownership, means of production,

00:09:36.484 --> 00:09:39.340
clash of economic interests.
 

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:44.014
For Weber, it is not economic
interest which drives human

00:09:44.014 --> 00:09:46.769
history but struggle for power.
 

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:52.610
And he can describe different
systems of authority over time,

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:58.230
but it is all described on the
quality and the nature of those

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:03.298
mythologies those in a position
of power come up with to

00:10:03.298 --> 00:10:07.354
legitimate what they are trying
to do to you.

00:10:07.354 --> 00:10:08.460
Right?
 

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.793
So that is one fundamental
difference between Marx and

00:10:13.793 --> 00:10:14.600
Weber.
 

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.922
There is another fundamental
difference, and you will have to

00:10:19.922 --> 00:10:24.977
bear this very much in mind as
this lecture on traditional

00:10:24.977 --> 00:10:26.928
authority unfolds.
 

00:10:26.928 --> 00:10:32.950
Though Weber develops these
different types of domination,

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:37.678
primarily to describe
historical change--

00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:42.129
grand societies,
traditional authority,

00:10:42.129 --> 00:10:46.558
charismatical authority,
legal-rational authority,

00:10:46.558 --> 00:10:50.389
kind of describe the evolution
of humankind--

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:56.471
and has a similar kind of
flavor than Marx's subsequent

00:10:56.471 --> 00:10:58.950
modes of production.
 

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.908
But Weber does more than that.
 

00:11:01.908 --> 00:11:07.027
These three types of authority
do describe all kinds of

00:11:07.027 --> 00:11:10.058
organizations or social units.
 

00:11:10.058 --> 00:11:14.890
Today we can talk about
legal-rational authority,

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:19.822
traditional authority,
or charismatic authority in

00:11:19.822 --> 00:11:25.197
contemporary society;
though he would call liberal

00:11:25.197 --> 00:11:29.178
market capitalism as the purest
type--

00:11:29.178 --> 00:11:32.135
and what pure type is,
I will talk about this in a

00:11:32.135 --> 00:11:34.928
minute--
of legal-rational authority.

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:39.171
He will say that even in
contemporary society we have

00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:43.820
organizations which are based on
traditional authority.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.436
The most obvious example of
traditional authority--and bare

00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:53.052
it in mind when we will be
talking about this today--is the

00:11:53.052 --> 00:11:54.563
family you live in.
 

00:11:54.563 --> 00:11:55.440
Right?
 

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.308
The family is primarily bound
together by tradition.

00:12:00.308 --> 00:12:04.605
But the very institution where
you are in now,

00:12:04.605 --> 00:12:08.804
universities,
do have a flavor of traditional

00:12:08.804 --> 00:12:09.759
authority.
 

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:10.808
Right?
 

00:12:10.808 --> 00:12:16.135
It has a kind of ethos where at
least we teachers believe that

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:20.240
you have to pay some respect to
the teachers.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.601
And we have all kinds of
traditional

00:12:23.601 --> 00:12:29.366
rituals--right?--which makes the
making, the functioning of a

00:12:29.366 --> 00:12:33.787
university in a way a
traditional organization.

00:12:33.787 --> 00:12:34.940
Right?
 

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.879
There is the graduation
ceremony, when you will be

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:44.533
wearing all these funny,
you know, academic dress,

00:12:44.533 --> 00:12:49.548
and then you are awarded a
degree,

00:12:49.548 --> 00:12:56.655
which is happening almost like
awarding a lordship by the

00:12:56.655 --> 00:12:57.417
queen.
 

00:12:57.417 --> 00:12:58.558
Right?
 

00:12:58.558 --> 00:13:02.243
The president will say,
"By the power vested in

00:13:02.243 --> 00:13:04.994
me",
and then by this power

00:13:04.994 --> 00:13:10.386
"will confer to you"--
right?--the degree of Bachelor

00:13:10.386 --> 00:13:13.125
of Arts or Bachelor of Sciences.
 

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:13.808
Right?
 

00:13:13.808 --> 00:13:19.245
This is very much like
conferring the title of Lordship

00:13:19.245 --> 00:13:25.283
on somebody, by the Queen of
England, by the powers vested in

00:13:25.283 --> 00:13:26.090
her.
 

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:31.120
Okay, so therefore Weber is
more flexible with Marx.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.892
No, it doesn't simply describe
society, but in every society it

00:13:36.892 --> 00:13:40.428
does describe certain
organizations.

00:13:40.428 --> 00:13:44.620
And in contemporary society we
often talk about charisma.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.432
And we have been talking a lot
about charisma in the last

00:13:49.432 --> 00:13:50.980
eighteen months.
 

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:58.261
When we were talking about
Barack Obama and Barack Obama

00:13:58.261 --> 00:14:01.837
being a charismatic leader.
 

00:14:01.837 --> 00:14:03.028
Right?
 

00:14:03.028 --> 00:14:08.390
So the charisma is also
something what we very often

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:12.279
invoke today,
describing the nature of

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:16.168
authority somebody is
exercising.

00:14:16.168 --> 00:14:22.491
Okay, so that's again,
you know, just a backdrop to

00:14:22.491 --> 00:14:29.321
the notion of authority,
and I hope it will help you to

00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:34.000
locate it more in the
literature.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.280
Now, as I mentioned also in
last lecture,

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.808
there are three major types of
authority.

00:14:40.808 --> 00:14:45.157
Traditional authority,
in which basically you have a

00:14:45.157 --> 00:14:50.206
personal master in charge,
and this personal master

00:14:50.206 --> 00:14:56.965
somehow appeals to old,
age-old, sacred rules,

00:14:56.965 --> 00:15:04.558
to ask you to obey his or her
commands--

00:15:04.558 --> 00:15:08.399
mostly his, but occasionally
her commands.

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:13.476
After all, there is a queen in
England, and there were queens

00:15:13.476 --> 00:15:15.928
in England for a long time.
 

00:15:15.928 --> 00:15:19.269
Okay, so that's traditional
authority.

00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:22.639
The other one is charismatic
authority,

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:28.201
where the person in charge
calls for obedience on the

00:15:28.201 --> 00:15:33.333
grounds that that person is
believed to have some

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:37.620
supernatural,
extraordinary powers.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:44.330
And finally legal-rational
authority: authority in which

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:51.284
the person who is issuing a
command is also under the same

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:56.408
law as people who are obeying
orders,

00:15:56.408 --> 00:16:01.072
and in legal-rational authority
you do not have a personal

00:16:01.072 --> 00:16:04.009
master,
you do not obey a person,

00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:06.808
but you obey the rules and
laws.

00:16:06.808 --> 00:16:11.350
That's why Weber calls it
legal-rational authority.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.259
As a shorthand,
I think it would be more

00:16:14.259 --> 00:16:18.585
obvious to call it liberal
authority or a liberal system of

00:16:18.585 --> 00:16:19.629
authority.
 

00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:24.303
I just want to make one more--
one very brief comment,

00:16:24.303 --> 00:16:27.918
as we proceed to traditional
authority;

00:16:27.918 --> 00:16:33.750
namely, that the three types of
authorities are not exactly of

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.620
the same ontological status.
 

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:41.178
Weber basically has two major
types of authority:

00:16:41.178 --> 00:16:46.120
traditional authority or
legal-rational authority.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.986
Charismatic authority does not
have the longevity what

00:16:50.986 --> 00:16:56.129
traditional authority or
legal-rational authority has.

00:16:56.129 --> 00:16:59.876
Charismatic authority,
as we will talk about this a

00:16:59.876 --> 00:17:02.798
great deal, is a revolutionary
force.

00:17:02.798 --> 00:17:07.679
Charismatic authority usually
occurs for a relatively brief

00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:09.108
period of time.
 

00:17:09.108 --> 00:17:15.108
Typically the charismatic
leader is one person,

00:17:15.108 --> 00:17:19.352
and it is very lucky if that
one person can maintain the

00:17:19.352 --> 00:17:23.440
charisma for all the time this
person is in charge.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.931
I mean, just after nine months
of the election of President

00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:33.381
Obama, we see a
little--right?--withering of his

00:17:33.381 --> 00:17:36.980
sort of strong charismatic
appeal.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.623
So in order to maintain your
charisma while you are in

00:17:40.623 --> 00:17:44.680
office--and especially for a
lifetime--is very difficult;

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.882
and even more difficult to
transfer charisma to another

00:17:49.882 --> 00:17:50.750
leader.
 

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.170
So charismatic authority is
really a change,

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.130
basically--as I will argue
later on--

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.036
from one form of traditional
authority to another form of

00:18:01.036 --> 00:18:04.618
traditional authority,
in Max Weber.

00:18:04.618 --> 00:18:07.269
So therefore really the two big
types--

00:18:07.269 --> 00:18:10.880
traditional authority and
legal-rational authority--

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.960
and what Marx called the
transition from feudalism to

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.597
capitalism;
or what we understand,

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:21.790
modernization is really nothing
else but the movement from

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.690
traditional authority to
legal-rational authority.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.048
Okay?
 

00:18:27.048 --> 00:18:32.358
Now let me go into today's
topic, and talk about

00:18:32.358 --> 00:18:35.069
traditional authority.
 

00:18:35.069 --> 00:18:38.980
And first about pure type.
 

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:43.037
I will describe his definition
of the pure type,

00:18:43.037 --> 00:18:47.700
but it needs a footnote what
pure type is all about.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:54.950
As I already pointed out,
Max Weber was a Kantian.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:19:00.069
That meant that Max Weber did
not believe that human

00:19:00.069 --> 00:19:04.990
knowledge, which completely
describes the reality,

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.194
is possible.
 

00:19:06.194 --> 00:19:07.298
Right?
 

00:19:07.298 --> 00:19:12.801
The reality is so infinitely
rich that the concepts what we

00:19:12.801 --> 00:19:18.115
develop is only mental images of
this object, what we are

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:20.675
developing a concept about.
 

00:19:20.675 --> 00:19:21.720
Right?
 

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.828
It can never be fully
describing the subject.

00:19:25.828 --> 00:19:30.819
So these mental objects,
what we have in our mind about

00:19:30.819 --> 00:19:35.440
the object, from which we try to
develop knowledge,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.490
is what he calls ideal types.
 

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:43.473
They are abstractions from the
world, not a precise description

00:19:43.473 --> 00:19:44.680
of the world.
 

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.790
So therefore what he said:
The best what we can aim at,

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.200
to develop ideal type,
pure types;

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.202
and all realities will be
always somewhat different from

00:19:57.202 --> 00:19:59.970
the ideal type,
what is in our mind.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.000
And as human knowledge is
progressing--

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.558
and that's what makes actually
Weber a difficult reading--

00:20:06.558 --> 00:20:10.792
is that in the process of
knowledge we develop an ideal

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:13.930
type and conceptions about the
world,

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:18.463
and then we go back to reality
and we see that it does not

00:20:18.463 --> 00:20:22.980
exhaust the reality as it is;
the reality has other important

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.759
features we missed in the first
instance.

00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:29.890
So we go back and we redo our
ideal type;

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:35.336
enrich the ideal type to
fit--to create a better fit with

00:20:35.336 --> 00:20:36.114
reality.
 

00:20:36.114 --> 00:20:36.990
Right?
 

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.400
That's the fundamental idea.
 

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.768
And that's what makes Weber so
difficult to read,

00:20:42.768 --> 00:20:45.856
because he often comes up with
an ideal type,

00:20:45.856 --> 00:20:46.980
a pure type.
 

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.119
And he said,
"Yes but when I am reading

00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:53.480
a historical reality,
it does not quite fit;

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.721
so therefore I'll redo a little
my ideal type and enrich

00:20:57.721 --> 00:20:58.568
it."
 

00:20:58.568 --> 00:21:02.920
So you can easily get lost when
you are reading Weber.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.817
And this is not accidental.
 

00:21:04.817 --> 00:21:05.308
Right?
 

00:21:05.308 --> 00:21:07.690
This is the methodology how he
proceeds.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.950
He does not believe that we can
attain absolute knowledge.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:16.480
What he believes,
that we have to strive to be

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:22.925
able to describe what we want to
describe as precisely as we just

00:21:22.925 --> 00:21:24.838
can--as we can.
 

00:21:24.838 --> 00:21:27.250
So this is the idea of pure
types.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:33.077
So what is the pure type of
legal-rational authority--of

00:21:33.077 --> 00:21:35.618
traditional authority?
 

00:21:35.618 --> 00:21:39.450
First of all we have to talk
about the basis of legitimacy--

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:44.470
just very briefly something
also about the patterns,

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:48.558
how a staff is being recruited,
as such.

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:54.470
And here he comes with a very
clear and simple definition.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:22:00.179
In traditional authority,
legitimacy is claimed for,

00:22:00.179 --> 00:22:05.104
and believed in,
by virtue of the sanctity of

00:22:05.104 --> 00:22:07.118
age-old rules.
 

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:13.520
So the person who rules makes a
claim that this has been always

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.006
this way,
and there is some sacredness

00:22:18.006 --> 00:22:22.055
in, in fact,
obeying the person who by

00:22:22.055 --> 00:22:27.778
age-old tradition was assigned
to a position of authority.

00:22:27.778 --> 00:22:31.670
Again, let me just go back to
the family.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.940
This is a classical example.
 

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:41.082
The parents do have some sacred
rights to issue some commands,

00:22:41.082 --> 00:22:47.640
and we do obey parents because
it was always this way;

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.900
children always had to obey
parents.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.624
To what extent they have to
obey, and what parents can do to

00:22:53.624 --> 00:22:56.150
children, may vary a little over
time.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:23:00.276
But the parents are in charge
and they are,

00:23:00.276 --> 00:23:06.269
in fact, to have the rights to
issue certain kinds of commands

00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:08.528
is widely accepted.
 

00:23:08.528 --> 00:23:12.545
But the word "believed
in" is also very important.

00:23:12.545 --> 00:23:13.088
Right?
 

00:23:13.088 --> 00:23:17.538
So the parents do not have to
force you to obey;

00:23:17.538 --> 00:23:21.865
you're beginning to believe
that it is indeed the right

00:23:21.865 --> 00:23:24.750
thing that the parents obey
order.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.948
It happens also if you
particularly dislike what they

00:23:28.948 --> 00:23:30.160
try to order.
 

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.151
And occasionally you may not
like one of your parents,

00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:36.108
or both of your parents.
 

00:23:36.108 --> 00:23:39.977
Nevertheless,
you think some degree of

00:23:39.977 --> 00:23:45.219
obedience is necessary;
unless you really break the law

00:23:45.219 --> 00:23:46.661
and you run away.
 

00:23:46.661 --> 00:23:47.338
Right?
 

00:23:47.338 --> 00:23:52.410
But that is certainly an
extreme case.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:58.027
As it is an extreme case that
parents will force children,

00:23:58.027 --> 00:24:02.660
use coercion of children,
to obey their rule.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.500
Well occasionally they use some
degree of coercion.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.838
It's also very important in
Weber;

00:24:09.838 --> 00:24:13.756
you know, that coercion is
always present in every type of

00:24:13.756 --> 00:24:14.650
domination.
 

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.203
Do not think that
legal-rational authority does

00:24:18.203 --> 00:24:19.750
not have coercion.
 

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:23.757
In the United States,
over three million people are

00:24:23.757 --> 00:24:24.397
in jail.
 

00:24:24.397 --> 00:24:25.119
Right?
 

00:24:25.119 --> 00:24:26.778
They are being coerced.
 

00:24:26.778 --> 00:24:30.084
In the United States,
people occasionally are killed

00:24:30.084 --> 00:24:33.130
by the government--right?--they
are executed.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:36.624
So there is coercion,
even in legal-rational

00:24:36.624 --> 00:24:37.598
authority.
 

00:24:37.598 --> 00:24:42.575
In the most liberal democratic
society, if you break the laws

00:24:42.575 --> 00:24:44.400
you will be coerced.
 

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.577
And if you are not breaking the
law, there is always the promise

00:24:48.577 --> 00:24:49.373
of coercion.
 

00:24:49.373 --> 00:24:49.970
Right?
 

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.848
It's said, "Well under
certain circumstances you will

00:24:52.848 --> 00:24:53.808
be coerced."
 

00:24:53.808 --> 00:24:59.960
Now the second important point
is--right?--

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.472
that the master who obeys the
order is designated by

00:25:03.472 --> 00:25:06.993
traditional rules--
right?--and they are obeyed

00:25:06.993 --> 00:25:09.759
because of their
Eigenwurde.

00:25:09.759 --> 00:25:14.017
Well Eigenwurde is
translated into English as

00:25:14.017 --> 00:25:15.769
traditional status.
 

00:25:15.769 --> 00:25:18.538
It's not a very good
translation.

00:25:18.538 --> 00:25:22.538
Eigenwurde really means
that they are believed to have

00:25:22.538 --> 00:25:26.247
virtues by themselves;
that they have a virtue what

00:25:26.247 --> 00:25:28.279
they themselves carry out.
 

00:25:28.279 --> 00:25:32.223
So there is honor;
I think the term honor is

00:25:32.223 --> 00:25:37.455
extremely important--right?--for
understanding traditional

00:25:37.455 --> 00:25:38.650
authority.
 

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:42.957
The traditional master is
always assumed to be an

00:25:42.957 --> 00:25:44.481
honorable person.
 

00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:45.288
Right?
 

00:25:45.288 --> 00:25:50.070
And if that person becomes not
honorable, it is likely that it

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.108
will lose its authority.
 

00:25:52.108 --> 00:25:54.491
Again, think about parents.
 

00:25:54.491 --> 00:25:55.108
Right?
 

00:25:55.108 --> 00:25:59.215
The parents are supposed to be
honorable, and if they are not

00:25:59.215 --> 00:26:02.297
honorable any longer,
there is a crisis in the

00:26:02.297 --> 00:26:03.048
family.
 

00:26:03.048 --> 00:26:07.030
Have you seen Arthur Miller's
play, the Death of a

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.180
Salesman?
 

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.828
This is exactly what happens in
the Death of a Salesman,

00:26:11.828 --> 00:26:16.759
when his son catches the
father, whom he admired so much,

00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:22.983
is catching him with another
woman than his mother.

00:26:22.983 --> 00:26:23.980
Right?
 

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.848
Then suddenly the father loses
his honor;

00:26:28.848 --> 00:26:32.525
he's not honorable any
longer--right?--and that creates

00:26:32.525 --> 00:26:34.838
a lifelong crisis for the child.
 

00:26:34.838 --> 00:26:38.724
So I think honor is very
important to understand

00:26:38.724 --> 00:26:40.710
traditional authority.
 

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:46.925
And it is based--traditional
rule is based on personal

00:26:46.925 --> 00:26:48.098
loyalty.
 

00:26:48.098 --> 00:26:53.490
You personally feel that you
have to be loyal to this person.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:58.351
Again, all of these issues do
apply to a substantial degree in

00:26:58.351 --> 00:27:00.821
institutions like a university.
 

00:27:00.821 --> 00:27:01.538
Right?
 

00:27:01.538 --> 00:27:08.608
It is also kind of
assumed--right?--

00:27:08.608 --> 00:27:12.097
that, you know,
professors should act in an

00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:15.071
honorable way,
and if they don't,

00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:18.630
they are caught of being not
honorable,

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.578
they will be losing their
legitimacy.

00:27:23.578 --> 00:27:27.950
And there is a great deal of
personal loyalty in university

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:28.930
situations.
 

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:32.921
Well particularly in graduate
school the relationship,

00:27:32.921 --> 00:27:34.880
the mentor and the Ph.D.
 

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.005
student, is a highly
personalized relationship of

00:27:39.005 --> 00:27:40.465
mutual loyalties.
 

00:27:40.465 --> 00:27:41.240
Right?
 

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.877
There is so much a mentor will
be able to take;

00:27:45.877 --> 00:27:47.288
that a Ph.D.
 

00:27:47.288 --> 00:27:50.784
student in the dissertation
will be too critical of the

00:27:50.784 --> 00:27:53.890
professor who is supervising the
dissertation.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:57.815
It expects some degree of
loyalty--right?--from the

00:27:57.815 --> 00:28:00.772
student;
and the student would be very

00:28:00.772 --> 00:28:05.121
disappointed if it turns out
that the mentor is writing bad

00:28:05.121 --> 00:28:06.319
letters for him.
 

00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:07.068
Right?
 

00:28:07.068 --> 00:28:10.172
There is an
expectation--right?--of mutual

00:28:10.172 --> 00:28:13.880
loyalty in every type of
traditional authority.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:18.856
And what is therefore
important, there is also a

00:28:18.856 --> 00:28:20.868
personal element.
 

00:28:20.868 --> 00:28:24.390
Whom you obey is a kind of a
personal master;

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:31.001
not simply a supervisor,
not a boss, but something of a

00:28:31.001 --> 00:28:36.758
personal master,
an honorable person to whom you

00:28:36.758 --> 00:28:40.308
are linked to by loyalty.
 

00:28:40.308 --> 00:28:44.618
Well how do you recruit staff
under this system?

00:28:44.618 --> 00:28:48.490
There are really two ways to do
it.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.460
There is a so-called
patrimonial recruitment;

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.861
namely, that people are
selected into position because

00:28:56.861 --> 00:29:01.242
they are related to the chief,
by tradition,

00:29:01.242 --> 00:29:05.318
because they are known to the
chief.

00:29:05.318 --> 00:29:10.678
This happens to a great deal in
various organizations even

00:29:10.678 --> 00:29:13.279
today;
especially university

00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:18.303
organizations do exercise a
substantial patrimonial system

00:29:18.303 --> 00:29:19.890
of recruitment.
 

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:25.465
But there are extra-patrimonial
ways when persons are judged to

00:29:25.465 --> 00:29:30.952
be loyal by the master and are
appointed to the office because

00:29:30.952 --> 00:29:34.460
of their expected loyalty,
as such.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.830
Again, I can give you the
example of the universities

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:41.592
where a lot of recruitment is
happening through patrimonial

00:29:41.592 --> 00:29:42.630
recruitment.
 

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.348
You are--well in the U.S.
 

00:29:45.348 --> 00:29:47.404
universities,
you are not supposed to recruit

00:29:47.404 --> 00:29:48.339
your own students.
 

00:29:48.339 --> 00:29:50.480
In Europe they do.
 

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.970
In the U.S. few universities do.
 

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:58.423
But you recruit the students of
your buddies or your friends or

00:29:58.423 --> 00:29:59.573
your colleagues.
 

00:29:59.573 --> 00:30:00.220
Right?
 

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:04.238
There's a lot of patrimonialism
going on in university

00:30:04.238 --> 00:30:05.298
recruitment.
 

00:30:05.298 --> 00:30:08.298
And, in fact,
loyalty is very important when

00:30:08.298 --> 00:30:12.486
it comes particularly to the
appointment of administrators in

00:30:12.486 --> 00:30:14.298
the university system.
 

00:30:14.298 --> 00:30:20.172
Well there are--let me move on
and let's have the broader

00:30:20.172 --> 00:30:22.058
historical view.
 

00:30:22.058 --> 00:30:26.674
There are various historical
variations of traditional

00:30:26.674 --> 00:30:27.720
authority.
 

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:33.210
Well Weber is very messy in
terms of terminology.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:36.798
I was trying to make as much
sense as I could.

00:30:36.798 --> 00:30:40.890
I think there are two major
forms of traditional authority.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:45.162
One is called patriarchalism,
and the other one is called

00:30:45.162 --> 00:30:47.068
patrimonial domination.
 

00:30:47.068 --> 00:30:51.150
The big difference between
patriarchal systems,

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:56.650
that it does not have a
staff--that what is being--

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.500
the authority is exercised
directly by the master and does

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.150
not need a staff in order to
exercise its authority.

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:07.221
Patrimonial domination,
on the other hand,

00:31:07.221 --> 00:31:08.720
does have a staff.
 

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:13.296
It is a larger scale society,
or a larger scale organization,

00:31:13.296 --> 00:31:17.720
where a staff will carry out
the commands of the master.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.667
This is--the distinction
between master,

00:31:20.667 --> 00:31:24.901
staff and the people who
obey--is extremely important for

00:31:24.901 --> 00:31:25.960
Max Weber.
 

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.800
And try to get deep down in
your brain, this comment,

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.568
because you cannot understand
Weber without this.

00:31:33.568 --> 00:31:37.104
As I pointed out,
Weber said there is always a

00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:41.108
degree of belief or faith
involved in legitimacy.

00:31:41.108 --> 00:31:45.657
But what kind of faith depends
a great deal whether the faith

00:31:45.657 --> 00:31:50.509
is by the staff in the master,
or by the people in the master.

00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:55.711
Weber's fundamental idea is
that the system is legitimate as

00:31:55.711 --> 00:32:00.650
long as the staff has a positive
belief in the master.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:05.196
The masses, the people,
usually do not have a positive

00:32:05.196 --> 00:32:05.970
belief.
 

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:10.190
They don't usually love the
person who rules them;

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.200
they just accept it as the
lesser evil.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.289
But the staff has to have a
positive belief in the master.

00:32:17.289 --> 00:32:19.990
When do come--revolution comes?
 

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:23.470
When the staff is losing faith
in the master.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:27.000
When the Shah of Iran fell?
 

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.685
When the security services in
Iran began to lose faith in the

00:32:32.685 --> 00:32:33.348
Shah.
 

00:32:33.348 --> 00:32:37.940
The people of Iran usually did
not like the Shah all that much.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:41.210
They just could not think of an
alternative;

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.519
so they accepted it.
 

00:32:42.519 --> 00:32:48.240
But the regime fell when the
security services lost faith in

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:48.920
them.
 

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.950
The same can go for the fall of
Communism.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.823
Communism fell when the
Communist Party staff,

00:32:55.823 --> 00:33:00.728
and especially the secret
services, began to lose faith in

00:33:00.728 --> 00:33:02.019
the system.
 

00:33:02.019 --> 00:33:06.595
Not that most people who lived
under Communism were all that

00:33:06.595 --> 00:33:07.990
bloody Communists.
 

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.690
Right?
 

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:10.890
But well the staff was.
 

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:14.615
When the staff turned out to be
against Communism,

00:33:14.615 --> 00:33:16.818
that's when Communism fell.
 

00:33:16.818 --> 00:33:20.768
Well patriarchalism--I will
make two distinctions here,

00:33:20.768 --> 00:33:23.838
primary patriarchalism and
gerontocracy.

00:33:23.838 --> 00:33:26.490
And then about patriarchal
domination,

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:30.730
about pure patrimonialism,
where the staff is purely a

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.769
person or instrument in the
master,

00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:37.450
and finally estate-type of
domination,

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.660
or what we normally call
feudalism,

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:44.845
when the administrative staff
actually appropriates certain

00:33:44.845 --> 00:33:47.078
powers from the master.
 

00:33:47.078 --> 00:33:50.751
And now what I'll do,
to show, I think,

00:33:50.751 --> 00:33:56.742
what Weber's theory of history
is--how these different types of

00:33:56.742 --> 00:33:58.578
systems evolve.
 

00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:02.440
He said that history begins
with patriarchalism.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.548
It's relatively small
societies, for instance,

00:34:05.548 --> 00:34:09.699
kinship networks,
where the elders or the father

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:14.289
can rule the society and does
not need policemen,

00:34:14.289 --> 00:34:18.909
jailers, you know,
judges, administrators,

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:22.059
tax collectors,
in order to run the staff.

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:24.670
It does it directly.
 

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:30.585
Then it moves to a primary
patrimonialism where the society

00:34:30.585 --> 00:34:32.320
becomes larger.
 

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.081
There is staff,
but the staff is individually

00:34:36.081 --> 00:34:40.527
selected by the master,
and they completely depend by

00:34:40.527 --> 00:34:41.809
the master.
 

00:34:41.809 --> 00:34:43.599
The most extreme example of
this is,

00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:46.710
as I will talk about this in a
minute,

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:51.070
sultanism where the sultan can
actually get rid--

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:54.750
typically gets rid of the staff
at will,

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.650
and very frequently.
 

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:01.260
Then it is moving to a feudal
type of domination,

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:05.829
where the staff appropriates
certain powers from the master--

00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:09.670
appropriates those powers
because, for instance,

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:13.222
it has land holding,
what is given to a noble

00:35:13.222 --> 00:35:16.268
family,
not only for life but also for

00:35:16.268 --> 00:35:19.027
the family for the life of the
family.

00:35:19.027 --> 00:35:19.699
Right?
 

00:35:19.699 --> 00:35:23.340
The feudal property has been
inherited,

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:28.280
and then the staff appropriates
certain powers from the master

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.507
and will act as a master,
for instance,

00:35:31.507 --> 00:35:32.980
even serve justice.
 

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:36.101
And finally,
legal-rational authority,

00:35:36.101 --> 00:35:41.079
where the power of coercion is
the monopoly of the state.

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:46.235
No individual has the right to
exercise coercive power,

00:35:46.235 --> 00:35:48.050
except the state.
 

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:49.679
Well this is not quite true.
 

00:35:49.679 --> 00:35:53.463
Parents, for instance,
still have some right--we feel

00:35:53.463 --> 00:35:57.757
uncomfortable about this--but
parents do have some rights to

00:35:57.757 --> 00:35:59.360
exercise coercion.
 

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.150
But generally you cannot
exercise any coercion;

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.320
only the state can.
 

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.835
So as you can see,
in a way, the history of

00:36:08.835 --> 00:36:13.021
humankind is an evolution of the
means of coercion.

00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:13.860
Right?
 

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.976
For Marx, the question was the
evolution of the means of

00:36:17.976 --> 00:36:18.949
production.
 

00:36:18.949 --> 00:36:23.996
For Weber, history is driven by
the evolution of the means of

00:36:23.996 --> 00:36:26.518
administration and coercion.
 

00:36:26.518 --> 00:36:32.250
Again, a very Nietzschian idea,
that dark read of the history,

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:36.672
that history actually is
getting worse because those who

00:36:36.672 --> 00:36:41.016
rule have more and more
sophisticated means to suppress

00:36:41.016 --> 00:36:43.429
a larger number of people.
 

00:36:43.429 --> 00:36:47.393
And what makes it even worse,
they internalize--you

00:36:47.393 --> 00:36:50.090
internalize your own submission.
 

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:53.436
Internally you believe that
this is the right thing,

00:36:53.436 --> 00:36:54.878
that you are not free.
 

00:36:54.878 --> 00:36:55.469
Right?
 

00:36:55.469 --> 00:36:59.375
That's again,
I think, the Weberian view of

00:36:59.375 --> 00:37:01.699
history, in my reading.
 

00:37:01.699 --> 00:37:05.610
Now about patriarchalism--is
the most elementary form,

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:11.190
as I said--when we
believe--right?--

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.940
that there is one master
without a staff,

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:18.320
who has the right to exercise
orders.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:23.704
Because it is no staff,
it is assumed that the members

00:37:23.704 --> 00:37:28.380
of the group which is under
patriarchalism--

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:32.400
for instance,
kinship networks--has a

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:38.431
substantial feeling that they
actually should obey this

00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:39.659
master.
 

00:37:39.659 --> 00:37:42.789
Weber calls them,
they are Genossen.

00:37:42.789 --> 00:37:45.391
They are comrades;
there is a camaraderie.

00:37:45.391 --> 00:37:45.900
Right?
 

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.329
This is a family. Right?
 

00:37:48.329 --> 00:37:50.710
The family has some degree of
oneness.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:54.050
They are not,
he said, Untertanen.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:57.159
They are not subjects to
authority, but they are

00:37:57.159 --> 00:37:57.753
comrades.
 

00:37:57.753 --> 00:37:58.349
Right?
 

00:37:58.349 --> 00:38:02.789
They are members of a community.
 

00:38:02.789 --> 00:38:11.869
Primary patriarchalism means
when there is typically a father

00:38:11.869 --> 00:38:15.389
kind of rule;
the father rules.

00:38:15.389 --> 00:38:19.896
Typically it's a--there may
have been maternal authority as

00:38:19.896 --> 00:38:20.440
well.
 

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:25.074
The historical record is a bit
unclear whether there were

00:38:25.074 --> 00:38:27.059
matriarchal societies.
 

00:38:27.059 --> 00:38:29.139
We can assume there were.
 

00:38:29.139 --> 00:38:31.539
So then they were
patriarchal/matriarchal

00:38:31.539 --> 00:38:32.260
societies.
 

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:36.320
It was a mother who ruled the
family, or a father who ruled

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.230
the family.
 

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:41.963
And the relationships were not
necessarily based on blood

00:38:41.963 --> 00:38:45.672
relationships,
because actually for a very

00:38:45.672 --> 00:38:50.889
long time we did not know that
the sexual act may have all that

00:38:50.889 --> 00:38:53.500
much to do with procreation.
 

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:58.219
It's a reasonably recent
discovery of human scientific

00:38:58.219 --> 00:39:00.980
knowledge that this happened.
 

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:04.889
And therefore in very early
societies it was not known that

00:39:04.889 --> 00:39:08.463
there is blood relationship
between the father and the

00:39:08.463 --> 00:39:13.829
children;
even then, it did hold.

00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:17.139
Well one sub-case is,
of course, slavery.

00:39:17.139 --> 00:39:19.956
I'll leave it out,
but let me talk about

00:39:19.956 --> 00:39:21.039
gerontocracy.
 

00:39:21.039 --> 00:39:25.920
There are some systems in which
the elders rule;

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.610
the older person has the
authority.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:34.699
Well gerontocracy is again
something which is not unheard

00:39:34.699 --> 00:39:37.880
of from modern societies as
well.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.980
Now let me move onto
patrimonial domination.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:48.487
And it does emerge--typically
emerge--when an administrative

00:39:48.487 --> 00:39:51.670
staff is being created.
 

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:53.400
This is larger societies.
 

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:58.503
You need armies and policemen
and tax collectors in order to

00:39:58.503 --> 00:40:03.867
operate, and the members who are
subordinated to your authority

00:40:03.867 --> 00:40:06.289
are treated as subjects.
 

00:40:06.289 --> 00:40:11.179
I mean, I'm also Her Majesty's
subject;

00:40:11.179 --> 00:40:15.331
you know, when I got once
Australian citizenship,

00:40:15.331 --> 00:40:19.657
and then, you know,
the Queen is still the Queen of

00:40:19.657 --> 00:40:20.869
Australia.
 

00:40:20.869 --> 00:40:25.110
So I'm Her Majesty's subject,
not simply an Australian

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:25.750
citizen.
 

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:26.469
Right?
 

00:40:26.469 --> 00:40:30.710
When there is a person with
whom the authority is relied.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.652
And in some ways in England,
and in Australia,

00:40:33.652 --> 00:40:36.596
this is the figure of the queen
who does that.

00:40:36.596 --> 00:40:37.250
Right?
 

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:42.161
Well I don't want to deal with
this because I am running out of

00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:42.556
time.
 

00:40:42.556 --> 00:40:43.268
Right?
 

00:40:43.268 --> 00:40:47.128
Initially patriarchal
domination--patrimonial

00:40:47.128 --> 00:40:51.250
domination was really just a
large household.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:53.681
And, in fact,
what, you know,

00:40:53.681 --> 00:40:56.509
the ruler,
the king or emperor did,

00:40:56.509 --> 00:40:59.268
he went from one village to the
next,

00:40:59.268 --> 00:41:02.208
with his staff,
and was fed for--like in a

00:41:02.208 --> 00:41:04.860
household,
and moved on.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:09.121
But then, of course,
it became more complex,

00:41:09.121 --> 00:41:12.590
and then had to create an
estate;

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:21.019
had to create an estate in
which moves beyond the oikos,

00:41:21.019 --> 00:41:28.838
where taxes are being
collected, and it's running in

00:41:28.838 --> 00:41:34.050
a--with kind of a bureaucracy.
 

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:37.699
Now in a pure type of
patrimonial

00:41:37.699 --> 00:41:44.313
domination--right?--the staff
are purely instruments in the

00:41:44.313 --> 00:41:47.050
hands of the master.
 

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:52.431
And like I mentioned,
sultanism is where there is

00:41:52.431 --> 00:41:59.608
virtually unrestrained power for
the ruler to replace those under

00:41:59.608 --> 00:42:03.309
its authority,
as it pleases.

00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:08.704
But then evolves in history a
more complex system:

00:42:08.704 --> 00:42:13.329
estate-type of domination,
or feudalism.

00:42:13.329 --> 00:42:21.030
It is a system in which--he
calls it estate-type of

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:29.193
domination--in which the staff
has a certain degree of

00:42:29.193 --> 00:42:31.349
stability.
 

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:40.570
Now how much stability it has,
it will depend how the staff is

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:43.139
being rewarded.
 

00:42:43.139 --> 00:42:49.800
And Weber makes a crucial
distinction between benefices

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:55.101
and fiefs;
these are the two ways how the

00:42:55.101 --> 00:43:02.110
staff can be rewarded in an
estate-type of domination.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:07.364
A fief, you will easily
remember that.

00:43:07.364 --> 00:43:08.500
Right?
 

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.389
We use the term in ordinary
language.

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:15.820
We say somebody has a fiefdom.
 

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:20.380
And by this we mean if somebody
has a fiefdom,

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:27.469
it means that somebody created
a sub-system over which it has

00:43:27.469 --> 00:43:31.286
control,
virtually as long as that

00:43:31.286 --> 00:43:36.556
position is alive,
or as that position is at least

00:43:36.556 --> 00:43:39.289
in the same organization.
 

00:43:39.289 --> 00:43:43.039
So again, if I can use the
university examples--

00:43:43.039 --> 00:43:47.090
you may not be as familiar with
this as I am--

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.831
but in universities,
for instance,

00:43:49.831 --> 00:43:53.820
office space for faculty is a
typical fiefdom.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.146
Once, you know,
a faculty got an office,

00:43:57.146 --> 00:44:01.751
it's virtually impossible to
take that office away from

00:44:01.751 --> 00:44:02.860
somebody.
 

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:10.619
It created a fiefdom over the
territory, what that person has.

00:44:10.619 --> 00:44:13.969
Well this is only for the time
of the tenure.

00:44:13.969 --> 00:44:17.231
Of course, somebody retires,
their office will be

00:44:17.231 --> 00:44:20.780
immediately taken away;
the fiefdom is lost.

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.081
But, you know,
the notion of fiefdom means

00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:26.980
that you have lasting power on
it.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:32.809
Benefice, on the other hand,
means that you get certain

00:44:32.809 --> 00:44:39.070
rewards, but only under the
conditions that you actually do

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:41.768
deliver to the ruler.
 

00:44:41.768 --> 00:44:48.840
And there are really two types
of feudal systems.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:57.766
One is based on benefices,
and this is a kind of prebendal

00:44:57.766 --> 00:45:00.900
form of feudalism.
 

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:05.070
That means the nobility who is
serving the czar--

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:10.034
for instance Russia was ruled
typically after Ivan the

00:45:10.034 --> 00:45:12.570
Terrible,
my namesake,

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:16.690
and until the Russian
Revolution,

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:24.248
by a kind of prebendal system,
in which the czar gave an

00:45:24.248 --> 00:45:29.474
estate to the lords,
as long as they were loyal to

00:45:29.474 --> 00:45:29.760
it.
 

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.199
We see this now happening in
Russia again.

00:45:33.199 --> 00:45:38.023
President Putin actually took
the billions of dollars of

00:45:38.023 --> 00:45:41.402
wealth,
what people received from

00:45:41.402 --> 00:45:45.409
President Yeltsin as private
property,

00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:47.909
because he did not think they
are loyal.

00:45:47.909 --> 00:45:51.250
So these people ended up in
jail, or they were sent into

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:52.039
emigration.
 

00:45:52.039 --> 00:45:54.260
Their property was taken away.
 

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:59.425
So even contemporary Russia,
in a way, operates almost like

00:45:59.425 --> 00:46:02.097
a prebendal type of feudalism.
 

00:46:02.097 --> 00:46:02.900
Right?
 

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:09.293
President Putin is a kind of
Ivan the Terrible--right?--who

00:46:09.293 --> 00:46:12.489
sort of reinforces loyalty.
 

00:46:12.489 --> 00:46:17.628
And I made the
point--right?--that was exactly

00:46:17.628 --> 00:46:24.251
as in Russia changed the feudal
system and when boyars were

00:46:24.251 --> 00:46:27.449
turned into pomeshchiks.
 

00:46:27.449 --> 00:46:30.809
Boyars in Russia,
before Ivan the Terrible,

00:46:30.809 --> 00:46:34.824
had inherited wealth,
and Ivan the Terrible and Peter

00:46:34.824 --> 00:46:38.838
the Great took that away and
turned them into serving

00:46:38.838 --> 00:46:42.429
nobility,
in exchange for loyalty.

00:46:42.429 --> 00:46:46.849
If you have listened to
Mussorgsky's fantastic opera,

00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:50.590
Boris Godunov,
you get the story there

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:51.610
exactly.
 

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:53.746
If you have not listened to it,
do.

00:46:53.746 --> 00:46:54.250
Right?
 

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:59.833
Don't get a Yale degree not
having known Mussorgsky's

00:46:59.833 --> 00:47:03.806
fantastic opera,
Boris Godunov.

00:47:03.806 --> 00:47:04.880
Right?
 

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.887
Well Western feudalism,
on the other hand,

00:47:09.887 --> 00:47:15.630
is based on long-lasting powers
of the staff.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:21.166
Western feudal lords received a
property for lifetime,

00:47:21.166 --> 00:47:26.389
and it actually was inherited
by their children.

00:47:26.389 --> 00:47:29.983
And, in fact,
they also exercised a great

00:47:29.983 --> 00:47:32.590
deal of administrative power.
 

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:33.400
Right?
 

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:39.273
Feudal lords in France or
England did held court and made

00:47:39.273 --> 00:47:43.260
judgments--right?--over their
serfs;

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.670
those who belonged to their
authority.

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:51.539
So they--and the kings were
rather limited in their power.

00:47:51.539 --> 00:47:55.809
Well we have seen this struggle
earlier in this course--

00:47:55.809 --> 00:47:59.764
right?--between the kings
trying to gain more of

00:47:59.764 --> 00:48:03.628
authority,
take it back from the feudal

00:48:03.628 --> 00:48:04.320
lords.
 

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:09.891
That's all what absolutism
versus constitutional monarchy

00:48:09.891 --> 00:48:11.284
was all about.
 

00:48:11.284 --> 00:48:12.179
Right?
 

00:48:12.179 --> 00:48:15.420
Well, of course,
for a constitutional monarchy,

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:22.969
it was not simply the feudal
lords who resisted,

00:48:22.969 --> 00:48:28.233
but also already the
bourgeoisie who wanted to have a

00:48:28.233 --> 00:48:34.409
constitutional monarchy to limit
the rights of the monarch.

00:48:34.409 --> 00:48:40.150
Well traditional authority
doesn't go very well with the

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:43.494
economy--
right?--because it is primarily

00:48:43.494 --> 00:48:46.400
oriented towards satisfaction of
needs,

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:50.215
and not generation of the
profit.

00:48:50.215 --> 00:48:51.170
Right?
 

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:57.625
And therefore traditional
domination is likely to prevent

00:48:57.625 --> 00:49:03.389
the development of
business-oriented activities.

00:49:03.389 --> 00:49:06.501
And that's, I think,
again true for the more

00:49:06.501 --> 00:49:10.335
traditional type of system,
what we are familiar with,

00:49:10.335 --> 00:49:13.230
like the family or the
universities.

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:20.380
They do not quite operate like
business corporations,

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:27.396
and therefore they may make
economic calculation and

00:49:27.396 --> 00:49:33.309
profit-seeking difficult or
impossible.

00:49:33.309 --> 00:49:38.380
They can be a defense against
market mechanism,

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.570
but do not promote market
mechanism.

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:49.981
Well, and of course in all of
these organizations there is a

00:49:49.981 --> 00:49:57.768
larger degree of arbitrariness
than in modern organizations.

00:49:57.768 --> 00:50:01.382
And, of course,
in traditional organization

00:50:01.382 --> 00:50:06.202
there is always a greater
respect to the welfare of those

00:50:06.202 --> 00:50:09.300
who are subjugated to authority.
 

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:14.251
So that's about traditional
authority and its tension with

00:50:14.251 --> 00:50:15.989
modern capitalism.
 

00:50:15.989 --> 00:50:17.820
Thank you.
 

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:23.000

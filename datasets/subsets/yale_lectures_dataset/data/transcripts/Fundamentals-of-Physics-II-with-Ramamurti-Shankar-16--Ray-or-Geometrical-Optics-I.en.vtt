00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.660
Prof: All right,
welcome back.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.360
We're going to do a brand new
topic.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.722
Well actually,
a brand old topic,

00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:14.288
because it's about light,
but I'm going to go backwards

00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:18.212
in time,
because just before the break,

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:21.990
we had this finish with a
flourish,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.300
Maxwell's theory of light.
 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.569
We took Ampere's law and Lenz's
law and Faraday's law and all

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.151
kinds of stuff,
put them together and out came

00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:36.295
the news: the view that
electromagnetic waves can exist

00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:39.501
on their own,
travel away from charges and

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:40.180
currents.
 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.304
And they travel at a speed
which happened to coincide with

00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:45.890
the speed of light,
and people conjectured,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.326
quite correctly,
that light was an

00:00:48.326 --> 00:00:50.560
electromagnetic phenomenon.
 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.990
And it was an oscillatory
phenomenon,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.941
but what's oscillating is not a
piece of wire or some water on a

00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:01.412
lake,
but what's oscillating is the

00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:02.429
electric field.
 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.929
It's oscillating in strength.
 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.069
The field is not jumping up and
down.

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:08.280
The field is a condition at a
certain point,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.569
you sit at a certain point,
sometimes the field points up,

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:13.280
sometimes the field points
down, it's strong,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.390
it's weak, and you can measure
it by putting a test charge.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.489
It's that condition in space
that travels from source to some

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:22.680
other place.
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.983
Now that point of view came
near the second half of the

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:32.108
nineteenth century,
and it came after many,

00:01:32.108 --> 00:01:35.349
many years of studying light.
 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:39.816
And what I'm going to do is to
tell you two different ways in

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:43.241
which you can go away from the
theory of light,

00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:45.400
of electromagnetic waves.
 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:53.358
One is, when the wavelength of
light is much smaller than your

00:01:53.358 --> 00:01:57.646
scale of observation,
namely, you're looking at a

00:01:57.646 --> 00:02:00.129
situation where you're thinking
in terms of centimeters and

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:03.221
meters and so on,
and the wavelength of light is

00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:07.656
10^(-8) centimeters,
then light behaves in a much

00:02:07.656 --> 00:02:08.968
simpler way.
 

00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:12.955
You can forget about the waves,
then you get this theory of

00:02:12.955 --> 00:02:17.008
light in which you have what's
called geometrical optics.

00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:21.699
Geometrical optics is just
light going in a straight line

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.720
from start to finish,
from source to your eye.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.669
So if you take Maxwell theory
and apply it to a situation

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.348
where the wavelength is very
small,

00:02:32.348 --> 00:02:35.556
then you get this approximation
that I'm going to discuss for a

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:36.280
while today.
 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.627
But when you say very small,
you always have to ask,

00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:40.330
"Small compared to
what?"

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.310
Do you understand that?
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.614
When someone says wavelength is
small, as it is,

00:02:44.614 --> 00:02:46.020
it has no meaning.
 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.917
I can pick units in which the
wavelength is million or 1

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:49.550
millionth.
 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.699
That has no meaning.
 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.250
Small and large can be changed
by change of units.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.696
What we really mean is the
following: suppose I have a

00:02:57.696 --> 00:03:01.218
screen and there's a hole in the
screen.

00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:04.508
And behind the screen,
there is a source of light.

00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:10.043
Then I put another screen here
and the light goes through that

00:03:10.043 --> 00:03:15.758
and forms an image which you can
obtain just by drawing straight

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:18.568
lines from start to finish.
 

00:03:18.568 --> 00:03:24.293
So you illuminate a region
which is the same shape as what

00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:25.800
you had here.
 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.378
That's what makes people think
of using ray optics.

00:03:29.378 --> 00:03:31.520
Ray optics, the light rays come
out,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.810
they're blocked by the screen
except near the hole,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.074
except inside the hole,
and the light escapes through

00:03:37.074 --> 00:03:40.970
that hole and fans out and forms
an image of the same shape.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.197
If you made a blip here in the
hole, you'll get a blip in the

00:03:45.197 --> 00:03:48.650
image, because it will simply
follow the shape.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.223
Now I can tell you what I mean
by, the wavelength is small or

00:03:52.223 --> 00:03:52.699
large.
 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.170
It's going to be small or large
compared to the size of this

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.758
opening.
 

00:03:56.758 --> 00:03:59.139
If λ,
the wavelength,

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.723
is much less than d,
which is the size of that

00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:07.162
opening here,
then you have this simpler

00:04:07.162 --> 00:04:09.189
geometric optics.
 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:15.330
That's the approximation.
 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.877
It's like saying,
if you have understood

00:04:17.877 --> 00:04:20.360
Einstein's relativistic
kinematics,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.750
if you go to small
velocities--again,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.166
one must say,
"Small compared to

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:24.680
what?"
 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.040
The answer is small compared to
the speed of light--

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.197
you get another kind of
mechanics called Newtonian

00:04:29.197 --> 00:04:31.471
mechanics,
which is simpler and was

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:32.750
discovered first.
 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.173
Likewise, geometrical optics is
simpler than the real thing and

00:04:36.173 --> 00:04:37.720
it was discovered earlier.
 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.403
You will note that this picture
is incomplete if λ

00:04:42.403 --> 00:04:46.250
becomes comparable to the size
of that hole.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.379
Then you will find out that if
you put a very tiny hole in a

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.165
screen,
and it would be very tiny

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:55.805
compared to wavelength,
the waves have then spread out

00:04:55.805 --> 00:05:00.920
and formed something much bigger
than the geometric shadow.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.343
Then you will have to realize
that drawing straight lines

00:05:03.343 --> 00:05:03.949
won't do it.
 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.399
In other words,
if I show you a side view,

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:10.778
you would think,
if you had a source,

00:05:10.778 --> 00:05:13.720
you'll form an image of that
dimension on the screen,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.110
but actually it will spread out
much more.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.574
And the smaller the hole,
the more the light will fan

00:05:19.574 --> 00:05:19.860
out.
 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.889
You're not going to get that
from geometrical optics.

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.596
But in order to realize that,
you will have to deal with

00:05:26.596 --> 00:05:29.548
apertures small comparable to
the wavelength of light and the

00:05:29.548 --> 00:05:32.060
wavelength of visible light is
5,000 angstrom,

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.269
which is very small.
 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:36.420
So it wasn't known for a while.
 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.319
Now you might say,
okay, if you want,

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:42.896
you can go back in time,
but you should probably start

00:05:42.896 --> 00:05:46.810
with this and build your way to
electromagnetic theory a la

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:47.620
Maxwell.
 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.675
Well, it turns out Maxwell
isn't right either,

00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:53.322
and to see where Maxwell's
theory fails,

00:05:53.322 --> 00:05:56.990
you will have to take light of
very low intensity.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.745
Remember, intensity is the
square of the electric field,

00:05:59.745 --> 00:06:00.949
or the magnetic field.
 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.639
They're all proportional.
 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.882
If light becomes really dim,
you might think the electric

00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:08.430
field is going to be smaller and
smaller,

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.771
because E^(2) or
B^(2) is a measure of

00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:13.598
intensity,
but something else happens when

00:06:13.598 --> 00:06:15.540
light becomes really week.
 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.629
You realize that the light
energy is not coming to you

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.009
continuously like a wave would,
but in discrete packets.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.649
These are called photons.
 

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:27.418
But you won't be aware of
photons if the light is very

00:06:27.418 --> 00:06:30.500
intense, because there are so
many of them coming at you.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.545
It's like saying,
if you look at water waves,

00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:34.870
you see this nice surface and
you're looking at the

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.870
description of that surface
undulating.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.819
You have a wave equation for
that.

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:41.425
But if you really look deep
down, it's made of water

00:06:41.425 --> 00:06:44.490
molecules, but you don't see
them and you don't need that for

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.870
describing ocean waves.
 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.569
But on some deeper level,
water is not a continuous body.

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:50.949
It's discrete,
made of molecules.

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:52.879
Likewise, light is not
continuous.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.970
It's made up of little
particles called photons.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.089
And that we will talk about
later.

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:01.040
So you understand the picture
now?

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.882
You're going back in time to
the ancient theory of light,

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:06.528
then we did Maxwell's.
 

00:07:06.528 --> 00:07:08.680
I won't stop there,
because I have already done it,

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.810
and we'll go onto the new
theory of light,

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.285
which involves photons,
and that's part of what's

00:07:13.285 --> 00:07:17.687
called quantum mechanics,
so we'll certainly talk about

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:18.300
that.
 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.610
So what did people know about
light?

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.120
Well, they had an intuitive
feeling that something bright or

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.740
shiny emits some light and you
can see it.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.555
It seemed to travel in a
straight line,

00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:33.706
and for the longest time,
people did not know how fast it

00:07:33.706 --> 00:07:34.670
traveled.
 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.007
It looked like it traveled
instantaneously,

00:07:37.007 --> 00:07:40.069
because you couldn't measure
the delay of light in daily

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:40.569
life.
 

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:43.939
You can measure the delay of
sound, but not the delay of

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:44.430
light.
 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.689
They knew it travels in a
straight line,

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:48.947
unlike some,
because if I close my face,

00:07:48.947 --> 00:07:51.440
you can hear me,
but you cannot see me.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.735
So sound waves can get around
an obstacle, but not light

00:07:53.735 --> 00:07:54.069
waves.
 

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:57.019
That one, everybody knew.
 

00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:59.129
But they did not know how fast
it travels.

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:01.125
Sound, they knew,
travels at a finite speed,

00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:03.629
because you go to the mountain
and start yelling at the

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:04.930
mountain, it yells back.
 

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.990
You can even time it and find
the velocity of sound.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.329
So Galileo tried to find the
velocity of light by asking one

00:08:13.329 --> 00:08:17.230
of his buddies to go stand on
top of one mountain,

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.009
and he's going to stand on top
of the other mountain with a

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:22.769
lantern which is blocked.
 

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:25.473
Then he's going to open the
lantern and the minute his

00:08:25.473 --> 00:08:28.415
friend saw this light,
he was supposed to signal back

00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:31.069
with another light signal,
come back to Galileo.

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:33.788
Meanwhile, he was timing it
with his pulse.

00:08:33.788 --> 00:08:38.200
Then he was going to--well,
that's the only clock you had

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.460
in those days.
 

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.506
I think the two mountains were
like 20 miles apart or

00:08:42.506 --> 00:08:45.614
something, so it's not
impossible that with the pulse,

00:08:45.614 --> 00:08:47.899
you can probably find the
velocity.

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:51.384
So you've got some answer,
but I think he realized very

00:08:51.384 --> 00:08:55.125
quickly that that answer just
measured the reaction time of

00:08:55.125 --> 00:08:56.610
him and his friend.
 

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.961
Do you know how you will
realize that,

00:08:58.961 --> 00:09:02.710
that it's the reaction time and
not the propagation time?

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.580
How will you find out?
 

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.190
You all had a good laugh at
Mr. G.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.139
but what will you do?
 

00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:10.418
How will you know that it's
really--yes?

00:09:10.418 --> 00:09:11.620
Student:  Vary the
distance between them.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.500
Prof: You vary the
distance.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.820
If he and his friend,
instead of being on two

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.688
different mountains,
are in the same room,

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:18.889
and they do the experiment and
they get the same delay,

00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:21.000
then they know that it's
nothing to do with the travel

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.278
time.
 

00:09:21.278 --> 00:09:24.798
It's just how long it takes
them to react.

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:28.288
So the real serious measurement
of light,

00:09:28.288 --> 00:09:30.287
you can't ask yourself,
"How am I going to measure

00:09:30.287 --> 00:09:31.730
it if it's traveling that
fast?"

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.426
First of all,
you don't even know if it takes

00:09:34.426 --> 00:09:35.529
any finite time.
 

00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:38.261
It's possible to imagine that
if you turn something on,

00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:39.679
you can see it right away.
 

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:41.259
It looks very natural.
 

00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:45.081
So the fact that it could take
a finite time was a hypothesis,

00:09:45.081 --> 00:09:47.712
but to measure it,
if it's going very fast,

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.529
you need a long distance.
 

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:52.221
Even the distance equal to the
circumference of the earth is

00:09:52.221 --> 00:09:54.375
not enough,
because it takes one seventh of

00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:56.970
a second for a light signal to
go around the earth,

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.100
if it could be made to go in a
circle.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.639
So that's too fast.
 

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:06.611
So the idea of finding the
velocity of light,

00:10:06.611 --> 00:10:11.019
the first correct way,
came from Roemer,

00:10:11.019 --> 00:10:13.278
I think in 1676.
 

00:10:13.278 --> 00:10:17.282
He did the following very
clever experiment:

00:10:17.282 --> 00:10:21.096
here's the sun,
let's say, and here is the

00:10:21.096 --> 00:10:23.889
earth and here is Jupiter.
 

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:27.320
It's got one of these moons
called Io.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.032
And the moon goes round and
round Jupiter,

00:10:30.032 --> 00:10:33.671
and we know from Newtonian
physics that it will go in an

00:10:33.671 --> 00:10:36.120
orbit with a certain time
period.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.808
If the earth was stationary,
this would go round and round

00:10:39.808 --> 00:10:41.038
with some period.
 

00:10:41.038 --> 00:10:44.455
I've forgot what it is,
an hour and something,

00:10:44.455 --> 00:10:46.580
to go once around Jupiter.
 

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.490
So what you do is you record
the pulse.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.106
Let's say you wait until it's
hidden behind Jupiter,

00:10:52.106 --> 00:10:54.158
or it comes right in front of
Jupiter.

00:10:54.158 --> 00:10:57.568
Pick any one key event in its
orbit, then wait for the next

00:10:57.568 --> 00:11:00.861
pulse, and wait for the next
pulse, and wait for the next

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:01.450
pulse.
 

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.009
You understand what I mean by
pulse?

00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:06.211
You can see it all the time,
but wait till it comes to a

00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:08.832
particular location in its
orbit, then repeat,

00:11:08.832 --> 00:11:09.940
then time them.
 

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.110
So that should be one hour and
something.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.450
Let's say one hour exactly.
 

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:20.423
But you notice that as the
earth begins its journey around

00:11:20.423 --> 00:11:24.436
the sun, it takes longer and
longer and longer,

00:11:24.436 --> 00:11:28.450
the pulses get spaced apart a
little more.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.203
And he found out that if you go
to this situation when the earth

00:11:32.203 --> 00:11:34.832
is here,
Jupiter hasn't moved very much

00:11:34.832 --> 00:11:40.538
in this time,
it takes about 22 minutes more.

00:11:40.538 --> 00:11:44.764
Namely, this pulse,
with respect to the anticipated

00:11:44.764 --> 00:11:47.299
time, is 22 minutes delayed.
 

00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:47.779
Do you understand?
 

00:11:47.779 --> 00:11:51.812
The delay is continuous,
but take the case now and take

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:55.658
the case six months later,
and the pulse should have come

00:11:55.658 --> 00:11:57.620
right there if it was not
moving,

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.230
but it comes 22 minutes later.
 

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:05.722
And he attributed that to the
fact that it takes light time to

00:12:05.722 --> 00:12:08.393
travel,
and it takes an extra time of

00:12:08.393 --> 00:12:12.259
traveling the whole diameter of
the orbit around the sun.

00:12:12.259 --> 00:12:15.528
And that's the 22 minutes.
 

00:12:15.528 --> 00:12:16.899
And how do you know you are
right?

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:20.690
Well, you know you are right,
because as you start going back

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.164
now, the remaining six months,
the pulses get closer and

00:12:24.164 --> 00:12:24.860
closer.
 

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.559
So this delay is clearly due to
the motion.

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:27.808
Yes?
 

00:12:27.808 --> 00:12:29.850
Student:  How could they
still see it

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.178
&gt;?
 

00:12:31.178 --> 00:12:34.710
Prof: Well,
it's not all in the same plane.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:39.210
So you can try to see it,
even if it's not the...

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:43.985
If you can see Jupiter at
night, which you do,

00:12:43.985 --> 00:12:49.080
then you'll be able to see the
satellite also.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.663
All right, so he calculated
based on that timing and this

00:12:54.663 --> 00:12:57.205
distance,
which was known to some

00:12:57.205 --> 00:13:00.153
accuracy at that time,
a velocity of light,

00:13:00.153 --> 00:13:03.320
that was roughly 2/3 the
correct answer.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.528
The correct answer is what,
3�10^(8) meters per second.

00:13:07.528 --> 00:13:10.639
He got 2�10^(8) or roughly
that much.

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:12.288
That was quite an achievement.
 

00:13:12.288 --> 00:13:17.035
I mean, it's off by some 50
percent, but till then,

00:13:17.035 --> 00:13:19.028
people had no clue.
 

00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:21.370
Also he used the best data he
had,

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.178
but the travel time was not
really--

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.908
the delay was not really 22
minutes,

00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:28.914
but maybe 13 or 14 minutes and
he didn't have the exact size of

00:13:28.914 --> 00:13:31.500
the orbit of the earth around
the sun.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.836
But it was quite an
achievement, take a number that

00:13:34.836 --> 00:13:38.772
could have been infinity and to
nail it to within 50 percent

00:13:38.772 --> 00:13:39.639
accuracy.
 

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:41.585
Then after that,
people started doing laboratory

00:13:41.585 --> 00:13:43.529
experiments to measure the
velocity of light.

00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:45.470
I don't want to go into that.
 

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:52.539
Everybody has something to say
about velocity of light.

00:13:52.539 --> 00:13:53.928
That's not the main thesis.
 

00:13:53.928 --> 00:13:57.751
The main thesis is to tell you
that what people had figured out

00:13:57.751 --> 00:14:00.527
by the seventeenth century is
that it travels,

00:14:00.527 --> 00:14:02.870
and it travels at a certain
speed.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:07.657
Now you guys have learned
geometrical optics in high

00:14:07.657 --> 00:14:09.159
school, right?
 

00:14:09.159 --> 00:14:09.870
Everybody?
 

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:15.909
Who has not seen geometrical
optics, lenses and mirrors?

00:14:15.909 --> 00:14:17.350
You've not seen?
 

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.519
Okay, that's all right.
 

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:23.832
But I will tell you,
I'll remind you what the other

00:14:23.832 --> 00:14:24.960
guys have seen.
 

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.960
I'm going to show you another
way to think about it.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:34.407
First thing they teach you is
if light hits a mirror,

00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:41.597
it bounces off in such a way
that the angle of incidence is

00:14:41.597 --> 00:14:45.070
the angle of reflection.
 

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.687
Second thing they will teach
you is that if light travels

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:51.080
from one medium to another
medium,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.830
say this is air and say this is
glass,

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.440
then the first thing to note is
that the velocity of light,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.028
c, is the velocity in
vacuum.

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:08.028
When light travels through a
medium, that's not the velocity.

00:15:08.028 --> 00:15:12.147
The velocity is altered by a
factor called n,

00:15:12.147 --> 00:15:17.232
which is bigger than 1 or equal
to 1, and n is called the

00:15:17.232 --> 00:15:20.139
refractive index of that medium.
 

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:22.340
I think glass is like 1.33.
 

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.380
Every medium has a refractive
index and the effective velocity

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.428
of light is slowed by this
factor, n.

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:31.475
So let us say,
this medium,

00:15:31.475 --> 00:15:34.856
let's not call it air,
n_1,

00:15:34.856 --> 00:15:38.788
this is refractive index
n_2.

00:15:38.788 --> 00:15:43.494
If a beam of light comes like
this and hits this interface,

00:15:43.494 --> 00:15:45.360
it won't go straight.
 

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.509
It will generally deviate from
its original direction,

00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:53.509
and if you call this the theta
incident,

00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:57.330
and you call this the theta
refracted,

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.240
then there is a law,
called Snell's law,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.450
which says n_1
sinθ

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.711
_1 is
n_2 times

00:16:04.711 --> 00:16:06.418
sinθ_2.
 

00:16:06.418 --> 00:16:08.750
And theta is measured--in fact,
let me call it

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.860
θ_1 and
θ_2.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:17.960
This is called Snell's law.
 

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.440
Look, the way to think of the
law is,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.977
if n_2 is
bigger, then sinθ

00:16:21.977 --> 00:16:24.408
will be smaller,
so this angle would be smaller.

00:16:24.408 --> 00:16:28.009
So when light goes from a rare
medium to a dense medium,

00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:30.825
it will go even closer to the
perpendicular,

00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:32.200
or to the normal.
 

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.456
And if you run the ray
backwards, from the dense medium

00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:38.893
to the rare medium at some
angle, it will go away from the

00:16:38.893 --> 00:16:40.158
normal even more.
 

00:16:40.158 --> 00:16:43.620
That was done and that was
measured and all that stuff.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.980
Then you can look at more
things.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:53.779
You look at mirrors,
parabolic mirrors,

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:56.899
where you know if a light ray
comes like that,

00:16:56.899 --> 00:17:00.389
parallel to the axis,
it goes through what's called a

00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:01.330
focal point.
 

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.296
Every parallel ray goes through
the focal point,

00:17:04.296 --> 00:17:07.009
so you can use it to focus the
light ray.

00:17:07.009 --> 00:17:07.740
That's what you see.
 

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.308
Whenever you have these
antennas, your own satellite

00:17:11.308 --> 00:17:15.440
dish, here's the dish in which
the rays come and they're all

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.328
focused onto one point.
 

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:20.857
That's where you put your probe
that picks up the signal from

00:17:20.857 --> 00:17:21.798
the satellite.
 

00:17:21.798 --> 00:17:26.002
It's a way to focus all the
light into one place,

00:17:26.002 --> 00:17:30.993
so it's a property of these
concave mirrors that they will

00:17:30.993 --> 00:17:34.759
focus all the light at the focal
point.

00:17:34.759 --> 00:17:36.690
Then you learn other stuff.
 

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.444
If you don't have the object at
infinity sending parallel rays,

00:17:40.444 --> 00:17:43.048
if you have an object here,
what happens?

00:17:43.048 --> 00:17:45.798
Well, you have to do other
constructions.

00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:48.259
If you have an object here,
for example,

00:17:48.259 --> 00:17:51.098
you want to know what image
will be formed.

00:17:51.098 --> 00:17:54.487
You draw a parallel line and
that goes through the focal

00:17:54.487 --> 00:17:54.980
point.
 

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.009
You draw a line through the
focal point.

00:17:57.009 --> 00:18:01.452
That comes out parallel,
and where they meet is your

00:18:01.452 --> 00:18:02.150
image.
 

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.785
And this is called
h_1,

00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:05.380
this is called
h_2.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.546
That distance is called
u, that's called

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:12.606
v, and you have this
result, 1/u 1/v is

00:18:12.606 --> 00:18:13.640
1/f.
 

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.517
By the way, there is no
universal agreement on what to

00:18:17.517 --> 00:18:19.200
call these distances.
 

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.582
Some people call it i
and o for image and

00:18:21.582 --> 00:18:21.980
object.
 

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.980
When I was growing up,
they called it u and

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:24.430
v.
 

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:31.339
I don't care what you want to
call it, but this is the law.

00:18:31.339 --> 00:18:35.588
Then you've got lenses.
 

00:18:35.588 --> 00:18:41.259
This is a piece of glass and it
has the property that when you

00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:46.464
shine parallel light from one
side, it all focuses on the

00:18:46.464 --> 00:18:47.859
other side.
 

00:18:47.859 --> 00:18:53.588
That's called the focal length.
 

00:18:53.588 --> 00:18:57.022
And if you have an object here,
it will go and form an image on

00:18:57.022 --> 00:19:00.115
the other side,
which will be upside down and

00:19:00.115 --> 00:19:02.720
that also obeys the same
equation,

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.305
except u is the distance
of the object and v is

00:19:06.305 --> 00:19:09.950
the distance of the image and
f is the focal length.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.650
So there's a whole bunch of
things you learn.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.690
That's all I want you to know.
 

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:20.165
Then there are some tricky
issues you must have seen

00:19:20.165 --> 00:19:24.017
yourself,
that if you got a lens that's

00:19:24.017 --> 00:19:29.750
not concave but convex,
like this, and if you shine

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.470
light on that guy,
what will happen?

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.631
This parallel ray of light,
you can sort of imagine,

00:19:37.631 --> 00:19:39.588
will go off like that.
 

00:19:39.588 --> 00:19:43.762
In fact, the way it will go off
is as if it came from some point

00:19:43.762 --> 00:19:45.420
called the focal point.
 

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.732
In other words,
these rays of light in this

00:19:47.732 --> 00:19:50.376
mirror, instead of really
focusing at some point,

00:19:50.376 --> 00:19:52.470
seem to come from the focal
point.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.967
And if you draw a ray of light
here, since that is a vertical

00:19:56.967 --> 00:20:00.190
part of the mirror,
you use i = r.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:02.068
That will go off at i =r.
 

00:20:02.068 --> 00:20:06.144
That ray of light when seen by
person here will seem to come

00:20:06.144 --> 00:20:10.150
from there, and if you join
them, you get an image here.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.608
That's the virtual image,
in the sense that this is a

00:20:13.608 --> 00:20:17.467
concave mirror--convex mirror
like the one you have in your

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:18.000
car.
 

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.680
And if forms a reduced image of
the object.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.868
Okay, so this is the scene from
Jurassic Park.

00:20:24.868 --> 00:20:27.608
That's the dinosaur,
and there's the Jurassic--

00:20:27.608 --> 00:20:28.930
I mean, the image of that,
and it says,

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.270
"Objects may be bigger
than what they appear in the

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.910
mirror."
 

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.942
That's what it's all about,
because one of these mirrors

00:20:34.942 --> 00:20:37.367
will make an image,
but it's called a virtual

00:20:37.367 --> 00:20:37.920
image.
 

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.323
In other words,
if you put a screen there,

00:20:39.323 --> 00:20:40.180
you won't see anything.
 

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.019
It's on the other side of the
mirror.

00:20:42.019 --> 00:20:44.395
Here, if you put a screen,
if you put a candle here and

00:20:44.395 --> 00:20:46.509
put a screen here,
you will see a bright image of

00:20:46.509 --> 00:20:47.170
the candle.
 

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.828
So this is a real image,
and that's a virtual image.

00:20:49.828 --> 00:20:51.861
The way you do these
calculations,

00:20:51.861 --> 00:20:54.938
you use the same formula,
except f will be a

00:20:54.938 --> 00:20:56.170
negative number.
 

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.061
Instead of really focusing,
it anti-focuses,

00:20:59.061 --> 00:21:01.145
so the focal point,
if you want,

00:21:01.145 --> 00:21:03.769
is on the wrong side of the
mirror.

00:21:03.769 --> 00:21:07.147
You'll get all the right
answers if you use a negative

00:21:07.147 --> 00:21:07.848
f.
 

00:21:07.848 --> 00:21:11.332
So your textbook will have many
examples of how to solve these

00:21:11.332 --> 00:21:13.160
problems, very simple algebra.
 

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.339
But what I want to do,
since many of you have seen

00:21:16.339 --> 00:21:19.292
this,
and to make it interesting for

00:21:19.292 --> 00:21:22.991
you,
is to show you there is a

00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:28.163
single unifying principle,
just one principle,

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:31.480
from which I can derive all
these laws.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.791
All the things I mentioned,
this is why I didn't stop and

00:21:34.791 --> 00:21:37.454
go into detail,
every single one of them comes

00:21:37.454 --> 00:21:39.230
from one single principle.
 

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:44.450
Anybody know what that
principle might be?

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.009
Have you heard of anything?
 

00:21:46.009 --> 00:21:47.048
Yes?
 

00:21:47.048 --> 00:21:47.809
Student:  I don't know
how to pronounce the name.

00:21:47.809 --> 00:21:49.058
It starts with an "H."
 

00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:50.470
Prof: You mean Huygens'
principle?

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.210
Student:  Yes.
 

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.470
Prof: No,
that's a different guy.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:58.029
This is the famous Fermat,
who had this theorem with prime

00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.828
numbers.
 

00:21:58.828 --> 00:22:03.817
His principle says light will
go from start to finish in a

00:22:03.817 --> 00:22:07.579
path that takes the least amount
of time.

00:22:07.579 --> 00:22:09.519
That's the path it will take.
 

00:22:09.519 --> 00:22:11.440
That's the Principle of Least
Time.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:27.038
 
 

00:22:27.038 --> 00:22:30.308
Now we find a lot of pleasure
when we can derive many,

00:22:30.308 --> 00:22:34.200
many things from a single
principle and you will see then,

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.448
all the stuff I wrote,
I can deduce from this one

00:22:37.448 --> 00:22:40.630
principle and that's what I want
to do today.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.069
So you don't have to carry all
that baggage.

00:22:42.069 --> 00:22:43.809
You can derive everything.
 

00:22:43.809 --> 00:22:45.920
So let's see how it goes.
 

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.260
So first let's say I am here
and you are here,

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.970
you send me a signal.
 

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.769
What's the path it will take?
 

00:22:52.769 --> 00:22:54.750
Where is the path of least time?
 

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.650
And everybody knows that's a
straight line.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.769
No point going any other way.
 

00:22:59.769 --> 00:23:03.526
So that tells you first,
light travels in straight lines

00:23:03.526 --> 00:23:05.778
when there's no other obstacle.
 

00:23:05.778 --> 00:23:11.196
The next possibility is,
I want the light--let me do

00:23:11.196 --> 00:23:17.568
this right because I'm going to
really draw some pictures.

00:23:17.568 --> 00:23:23.787
I want the light to hit the
mirror and then come to me,

00:23:23.787 --> 00:23:26.319
so it's like a race.
 

00:23:26.319 --> 00:23:27.640
You are here.
 

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.609
You've got to touch the wall
and go to the finish line.

00:23:31.609 --> 00:23:33.309
Whoever gets there first wins.
 

00:23:33.309 --> 00:23:37.210
That's the path light will take.
 

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.259
Now there are different
attitudes you can have.

00:23:40.259 --> 00:23:43.410
First is, you can start
wandering like this.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.861
You know that person's a loser,
because that's not the way to

00:23:46.861 --> 00:23:48.068
optimize your time.
 

00:23:48.068 --> 00:23:50.740
So we don't even listen to that
person.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.858
There are other reasonable
people who may have a different

00:23:52.858 --> 00:23:53.118
view.
 

00:23:53.118 --> 00:23:55.699
One person may say,
"Look, he told me to touch

00:23:55.699 --> 00:23:58.640
the wall, so I'm going to get
that out of my way first.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.430
Then I'm going to go
there."

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.250
Fine, that's a possibility.
 

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.836
Another person can say,
"Well, let me touch the

00:24:05.836 --> 00:24:08.678
wall right in front of this
person, then run over to meet

00:24:08.678 --> 00:24:09.440
the person.
 

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.269
That's another
possibility."

00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:13.618
So there are different options
open to you.

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:18.185
And we've got to find from all
these possible paths the one of

00:24:18.185 --> 00:24:19.160
least time.
 

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.798
That's the goal.
 

00:24:20.798 --> 00:24:23.492
Now I already said,
when you look at paths,

00:24:23.492 --> 00:24:27.019
the path to the mirror has got
to be a straight line.

00:24:27.019 --> 00:24:30.838
You gain nothing by wiggling
around.

00:24:30.838 --> 00:24:34.199
And the path back from the
mirror to the receiving point

00:24:34.199 --> 00:24:37.498
should also be a straight line,
because the winner lies

00:24:37.498 --> 00:24:38.720
somewhere there.
 

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.305
Anybody who doesn't follow a
straight line in free space is

00:24:42.305 --> 00:24:43.480
not going to win.
 

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.030
So the only freedom you have,
the only thing you want to ask,

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.752
is the following:
"Where should I hit that

00:24:49.752 --> 00:24:50.759
mirror?"
 

00:24:50.759 --> 00:24:51.558
right?
 

00:24:51.558 --> 00:24:56.779
So let's call that point where
you hit as x.

00:24:56.779 --> 00:25:01.058
Let's say the distance between
these two points is L.

00:25:01.058 --> 00:25:04.258
This is at some height
h_1,

00:25:04.258 --> 00:25:07.680
this is at some height
h_2.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.589
So what I will do,
is I will simply calculate the

00:25:11.589 --> 00:25:16.558
time, then find the x for
which the time is minimum.

00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:18.880
So what's the time taken for
the first segment?

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.440
So let's find the total time.
 

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.663
It will be the distance,
d_1,

00:25:23.663 --> 00:25:25.642
divided by the velocity of
light distance

00:25:25.642 --> 00:25:28.509
d_2 divided by
the velocity of light.

00:25:28.509 --> 00:25:31.240
d_1,
you can see,

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:36.009
is h_1^(2)
x^(2),

00:25:36.009 --> 00:25:43.998
divided by c
h_2^(2) L -

00:25:43.998 --> 00:25:49.910
x squared divided by
c,

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.950
just from Pythagoras' theorem,
right?

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:58.808
It's d_1/c
d_2/c.

00:25:58.808 --> 00:26:00.819
So let's multiply everything by
c.

00:26:00.819 --> 00:26:02.450
That doesn't matter.
 

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.872
Whether you minimize cT
or T, it doesn't make any

00:26:05.872 --> 00:26:06.588
difference.
 

00:26:06.588 --> 00:26:11.157
So let's take d/dx of
this whole expression and equate

00:26:11.157 --> 00:26:11.920
it to 0.
 

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.318
That's how we find the minimum
of anything.

00:26:15.318 --> 00:26:18.568
So let me take d/dx of
the first term.

00:26:18.568 --> 00:26:23.607
That is x divided by square
root of h_1^(2)

00:26:23.607 --> 00:26:24.890
x^(2).
 

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:25.769
You understand?
 

00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:29.269
Something to the power ½
is ½ times something to

00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:31.851
the power -½
times derivative of what's

00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:33.900
inside,
that's the 2x.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.400
That's what cancels the
½ and you get this.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.480
This is the d/dx of the
first term.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.573
The d/dx of the second
term will look pretty much the

00:26:44.573 --> 00:26:44.940
same.
 

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.926
It will look like L - x
divided by

00:26:47.926 --> 00:26:51.960
h_2^(2)  (L
− x)^(2),

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.624
but when you take the
derivative of (L −

00:26:53.624 --> 00:26:55.605
x)^(2),
you get a 2 times L - x

00:26:55.605 --> 00:26:58.769
and another - sign from
differentiating that guy,

00:26:58.769 --> 00:27:00.170
so you will get that.
 

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:06.078
And that's what should = 0.
 

00:27:06.078 --> 00:27:09.414
Therefore the point x has to
satisfy this condition,

00:27:09.414 --> 00:27:12.618
but what is x over
d_1?

00:27:12.618 --> 00:27:16.519
This is just x over
d_1 = L - x

00:27:16.519 --> 00:27:18.710
over d_2.
 

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.338
So here is x and here is
L - x.

00:27:21.338 --> 00:27:24.938
So x over
d_1 is cosine

00:27:24.938 --> 00:27:28.537
of this angle and that is cosine
of that angle,

00:27:28.537 --> 00:27:29.318
right?
 

00:27:29.318 --> 00:27:31.088
I don't know what you want to
call it?

00:27:31.088 --> 00:27:36.140
Let's say it's cosine α
= cosine β.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:42.930
That means α = β.
 

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.415
Or if you like,
90 - α

00:27:45.415 --> 00:27:48.178
is 90 - β
and 90 - α

00:27:48.178 --> 00:27:53.702
is what one normally calls the
angle of incidence and this is

00:27:53.702 --> 00:27:57.108
called the angle of reflection.
 

00:27:57.108 --> 00:28:02.463
So you get
θ_i =

00:28:02.463 --> 00:28:06.558
θ_r.
 

00:28:06.558 --> 00:28:08.862
Now it's something everybody
should be following,

00:28:08.862 --> 00:28:11.259
because if you don't follow,
you should stop me.

00:28:11.259 --> 00:28:15.577
But it's very interesting that
i = r is the way for

00:28:15.577 --> 00:28:20.275
light to go from here to there
after touching the mirror in the

00:28:20.275 --> 00:28:22.170
least amount of time.
 

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.519
So this is the first victory
for the Principle of Least Time.

00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:33.338
It reproduces this result.
 

00:28:33.338 --> 00:28:39.038
Now I'm going to reproduce a
second result.

00:28:39.038 --> 00:28:43.589
That's when light changes the
medium.

00:28:43.589 --> 00:28:46.130
So here it is.
 

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.259
Now the challenge is different.
 

00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:52.642
So here is h_1
in a medium with a refractive

00:28:52.642 --> 00:28:56.732
index n_1, and
you want to go there in a

00:28:56.732 --> 00:28:58.401
medium,
refractive index

00:28:58.401 --> 00:29:03.920
n_2,
and the distance between these

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.838
points is L.
 

00:29:06.838 --> 00:29:12.983
So imagine you are the light
ray and this is the beach and

00:29:12.983 --> 00:29:15.140
this is the ocean.
 

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:20.548
You are the lifeguard and here
is the person asking for help.

00:29:20.548 --> 00:29:24.788
Now how do you get there in the
least amount of time?

00:29:24.788 --> 00:29:28.353
One point of view is to say,
"Look, let's go in a

00:29:28.353 --> 00:29:31.310
straight line,
because we have learned that's

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:32.788
always good."
 

00:29:32.788 --> 00:29:36.192
But it may not be always good,
because maybe you want to spend

00:29:36.192 --> 00:29:39.092
less time in the water,
because you are slower in the

00:29:39.092 --> 00:29:39.650
water.
 

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:41.190
One point of view is to say,
"Look,

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:44.509
let's go as far as we can in
the land,

00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:47.867
and then minimize the swimming
time because we can swim slower

00:29:47.867 --> 00:29:49.190
than we can run."
 

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.608
That's a possibility.
 

00:29:50.608 --> 00:29:52.430
Or you can draw all kinds of
possibilities.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.538
So we're going to find one that
has the least amount of time.

00:29:55.538 --> 00:30:01.196
If this happens to be the
answer, it should turn out in

00:30:01.196 --> 00:30:06.960
the end, so once again,
let's assume that we do that.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:14.140
And let this be at a distance
x from the left.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.680
Now what do you want to
minimize?

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.670
Again, you want to minimize the
travel time, T.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:23.170
That's going to be
h_1^(2) x^(2)

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:27.160
divided by
n_1c.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.713
That's the only subtlety,
because the time--I'm sorry,

00:30:31.713 --> 00:30:36.440
not n_1c--time
n_1.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.598
It's c over
n_1.

00:30:37.598 --> 00:30:39.828
You want to divide by the
velocity in the medium.

00:30:39.828 --> 00:30:41.710
Velocity is c divided by
n_1.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.404
Also you should know,
it's going to take longer in

00:30:44.404 --> 00:30:47.154
anything but a vacuum,
so n_1_

00:30:47.154 --> 00:30:48.750
should come on top.
 

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.917
Then you have the other term,
that is,

00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:59.113
h_2^(2) L -
x squared divided by

00:30:59.113 --> 00:31:03.618
c times
n_2.

00:31:03.618 --> 00:31:06.950
And this will tell you what to
do.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:11.045
So you see, I'm teaching you a
lot of practical things in this

00:31:11.045 --> 00:31:11.650
course.
 

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:14.804
I taught you,
if you're in a tsunami

00:31:14.804 --> 00:31:18.500
situation, remember what you
should do?

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.632
You should calculate the
gradient and go along the

00:31:22.632 --> 00:31:23.558
gradient.
 

00:31:23.558 --> 00:31:26.029
On the other hand,
if it's a volcano and you

00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:29.190
calculate the gradient,
you go opposite the gradient.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:30.450
So this is one more thing.
 

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:34.090
If you want to rescue somebody,
you've got to go towards the

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.608
water in such an angle that this
function is minimized.

00:31:37.608 --> 00:31:41.308
So I suggest we calculate it
and keep the answer ready,

00:31:41.308 --> 00:31:43.279
because if you really want to
be a lifeguard,

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:46.000
what you should do is swim and
measure your speed,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.990
run and measure your speed.
 

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:50.180
It's the ratio of those two
speeds, n_1 to

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.181
n_2 ,
that will tell you where to hit

00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:52.710
the water.
 

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:55.250
Okay, so we're going to do that
now.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.950
So I take d/dx of all of
these things.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:58.779
What's the difference?
 

00:31:58.779 --> 00:32:01.846
It looks the same,
except you've got an

00:32:01.846 --> 00:32:04.588
n_1 everywhere,
right?

00:32:04.588 --> 00:32:11.288
h_1^(2) x^(2
)should = (L −

00:32:11.288 --> 00:32:16.957
x)n_2/h
_2^(2) (L −

00:32:16.957 --> 00:32:18.890
x)^(2).
 

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:20.529
So what is x over this?
 

00:32:20.529 --> 00:32:27.160
This is the x.
 

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:32.152
So n_1x over
that distance = cosine of this

00:32:32.152 --> 00:32:32.829
angle.
 

00:32:32.829 --> 00:32:34.160
You understand?
 

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:39.118
That's the sine of that angle.
 

00:32:39.118 --> 00:32:41.729
 x over that is cosine
of this angle or the sine of

00:32:41.729 --> 00:32:43.892
that angle,
since people like to write it

00:32:43.892 --> 00:32:48.310
in terms of sine,
you get this result,

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:53.958
n_2
sinθ

00:32:53.958 --> 00:32:57.380
_2.
 

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.720
So this is Snell's law.
 

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.548
It also comes from the
principle of least time.

00:33:01.548 --> 00:33:04.140
Each one of them has got
interesting consequences.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.559
I don't have time to do it,
but you can imagine some of the

00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:11.229
consequences are,
if you are in the bottom of a

00:33:11.229 --> 00:33:13.769
lake,
and you look outside,

00:33:13.769 --> 00:33:18.119
the light rays go like that,
because lake is dense,

00:33:18.119 --> 00:33:19.630
air is not so dense.
 

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:23.588
That means you can see stuff
right up to the horizon by

00:33:23.588 --> 00:33:26.670
taking an angle,
so that this comes exactly

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:27.328
here.
 

00:33:27.328 --> 00:33:28.588
So if you're a fish and you
look out,

00:33:28.588 --> 00:33:30.546
you can see right up to the
surface of the lake without

00:33:30.546 --> 00:33:31.848
going to the surface of the
lake,

00:33:31.848 --> 00:33:33.990
because all the light,
right up to the surface,

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:37.358
bends and comes into you.
 

00:33:37.358 --> 00:33:41.210
Or if you've got a flashlight
and you're sending a signal,

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.868
maybe hoping somebody there
will see it,

00:33:42.868 --> 00:33:45.844
actually it will bend and
somebody at this angle will see

00:33:45.844 --> 00:33:46.108
it.
 

00:33:46.108 --> 00:33:49.060
And if your angle x is a
certain critical angle,

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:52.067
your flashlight will go to the
surface, and beyond that,

00:33:52.067 --> 00:33:54.088
it will just get fully
reflected.

00:33:54.088 --> 00:33:56.960
It won't be able to go to the
other side.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.759
So another useful thing to
know, if you're going to be

00:34:00.759 --> 00:34:05.278
under water, you're lying there,
you've got some concrete blocks

00:34:05.278 --> 00:34:07.000
you're dealing with.
 

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.800
Meanwhile you're trying to send
a signal.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.130
What angle should you send it?
 

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:13.239
You've got to remember that
it's not going to go in a

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:13.889
straight line.
 

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:19.710
These are all useful lessons
from 201.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:23.929
All right, so now I'm going to
do the third thing.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:28.119
The third thing is very
interesting, which is the

00:34:28.119 --> 00:34:32.135
following: we say,
take the path of least time,

00:34:32.135 --> 00:34:33.010
right?
 

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:37.420
Now there is a problem that
occurs when there's more than

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.389
one path of least time.
 

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:41.590
That's what we're going to talk
about now.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:42.900
What if there's more than one
answer?

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.820
I'm going to give that to you,
so here it is.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:55.260
Take an elliptical room,
Oval Office.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.385
You stand here,
at one of the focal points,

00:34:59.385 --> 00:35:05.376
and you want to send a signal
to the person in the other focal

00:35:05.376 --> 00:35:07.929
point, a light signal.
 

00:35:07.929 --> 00:35:10.579
You know what you have to do.
 

00:35:10.579 --> 00:35:15.181
That portion of the mirror is
like horizontal mirror,

00:35:15.181 --> 00:35:15.889
right?
 

00:35:15.889 --> 00:35:18.090
So it's like the tangent to the
horizontal,

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:21.090
so it's very clear that if you
send it like that,

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:25.050
it will end up here,
because it will obey i =

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.139
r,
and you can see from similar

00:35:27.139 --> 00:35:29.440
triangles,
that distance and that distance

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.204
are equal,
and therefore they are similar

00:35:33.204 --> 00:35:34.340
triangles.
 

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.059
Are you will me?
 

00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:37.909
This is the angle at which you
should send it.

00:35:37.909 --> 00:35:40.476
If you send it to this
midpoint, by symmetry,

00:35:40.476 --> 00:35:42.809
it will come to the other focal
point.

00:35:42.809 --> 00:35:47.619
Okay, so now imagine that this
is not a mirror,

00:35:47.619 --> 00:35:52.010
but some steel walls and you
have a gun.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.449
You've got one bullet left.
 

00:35:54.449 --> 00:35:58.420
You are here and your enemy is
here.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:03.070
Now what direction will you
fire in?

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.369
Pardon me?
 

00:36:04.369 --> 00:36:05.780
Student:  At him.
 

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:06.409
Prof: Right.
 

00:36:06.409 --> 00:36:08.369
So you can fire-- very good.
 

00:36:08.369 --> 00:36:10.260
See, this is why I forgot.
 

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.519
So that's a little steel plate.
 

00:36:14.519 --> 00:36:16.389
Now what will you do?
 

00:36:16.389 --> 00:36:19.219
That's like asking the light
how to go from A to B without

00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:21.552
hitting the mirror,
I agree, that's the shortest

00:36:21.552 --> 00:36:22.000
time.
 

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.398
But if there's something
blocking you,

00:36:24.398 --> 00:36:27.641
then you know the other
person's at the other focal

00:36:27.641 --> 00:36:28.289
point.
 

00:36:28.289 --> 00:36:32.860
Now which direction should you
aim?

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.269
You know the answer.
 

00:36:34.269 --> 00:36:35.030
I gave it, right?
 

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:38.130
Give me an answer then.
 

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:39.239
Yes?
 

00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:42.849
Student:  At that point
in the wall.

00:36:42.849 --> 00:36:44.420
Prof: At that point in
the wall.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:50.380
But it turns out,
you can aim anywhere you like.

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.590
You will thank me when you use
that rule.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:58.409
In other words,
you can shoot any direction.

00:36:58.409 --> 00:36:59.110
See?
 

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.960
This is the guy who took only
Physics 200.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.230
This person took Physics 201.
 

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.929
That's what 201 gives you.
 

00:37:06.929 --> 00:37:07.960
Now that's amazing, right?
 

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.710
I'm telling you,
shoot anywhere you want.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.829
You know that bullets are like
light.

00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:16.610
They follow angle of incidence
= angle of reflection.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:18.489
This beam obeys i = r.
 

00:37:18.489 --> 00:37:20.389
You can see by symmetry.
 

00:37:20.389 --> 00:37:23.099
How about this one I shot at
some random angle?

00:37:23.099 --> 00:37:26.619
The way to think of that is to
draw a tangential plane mirror

00:37:26.619 --> 00:37:27.090
there.
 

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.900
As far as this beam is
concerned, the mirror could be

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.280
flat.
 

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.079
It doesn't know it's curving
away.

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:35.719
That angle better be equal to
that angle.

00:37:35.719 --> 00:37:38.119
That's the way you should fire
it, because you find the

00:37:38.119 --> 00:37:39.784
tangent,
then draw the normal to the

00:37:39.784 --> 00:37:41.574
tangent,
and choose and angle so that

00:37:41.574 --> 00:37:44.460
that and that become equal,
and the bullet ends up here.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.659
But I'm saying you don't have
to do all that.

00:37:46.659 --> 00:37:49.983
You shoot anywhere you like,
you go crazy,

00:37:49.983 --> 00:37:54.117
shoot in any direction,
they will all end up on this

00:37:54.117 --> 00:37:55.010
person.
 

00:37:55.010 --> 00:38:00.070
So why is that?
 

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.650
Pardon me?
 

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:02.780
That's the definition of an
ellipse,

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:07.009
but why does the definition--if
you follow the Principle of

00:38:07.009 --> 00:38:10.548
Least Time,
why should that also work,

00:38:10.548 --> 00:38:14.619
according to the Principle of
Least Time?

00:38:14.619 --> 00:38:18.101
I know this path is a path of
least time, because it obeys

00:38:18.101 --> 00:38:21.704
i = r with respect to
this mirror, so I know it's the

00:38:21.704 --> 00:38:23.110
path of least time.
 

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:23.900
You agree?
 

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:27.139
Student: 
&gt;

00:38:27.139 --> 00:38:28.010
Prof: That is correct.
 

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:31.949
In other words,
the time it takes is really

00:38:31.949 --> 00:38:34.389
that length that length.
 

00:38:34.389 --> 00:38:38.485
But an ellipse is a figure that
is drawn keeping the sum of that

00:38:38.485 --> 00:38:40.889
distance to that distance
constant.

00:38:40.889 --> 00:38:42.139
That's how an ellipse is drawn.
 

00:38:42.139 --> 00:38:45.567
Take two thumbtacks and put
them in the paper and you take a

00:38:45.567 --> 00:38:48.472
string of some length,
and you stretch it out,

00:38:48.472 --> 00:38:52.110
grab your pencil and move it,
and you will draw the ellipse.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.434
So that distance is
r_1 and that

00:38:54.434 --> 00:38:56.179
distance is
r_2,

00:38:56.179 --> 00:38:59.902
r_1 r_2
= constant is what defines

00:38:59.902 --> 00:39:00.710
an ellipse.
 

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:04.050
But the time taken is really
r_1 r_2

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:05.550
divided by c.
 

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.827
So if you were to design a
surface so that if you shot

00:39:08.827 --> 00:39:11.503
something one point,
it will all end up here,

00:39:11.503 --> 00:39:13.699
all the light from here will
focus here,

00:39:13.699 --> 00:39:17.239
you should build an ellipse,
and send the light from one

00:39:17.239 --> 00:39:18.139
focal point.
 

00:39:18.139 --> 00:39:21.396
Likewise, if you talk,
also the sound will come to

00:39:21.396 --> 00:39:22.659
that other point.
 

00:39:22.659 --> 00:39:25.632
Now sound waves behave more
like waves rather than

00:39:25.632 --> 00:39:27.817
geometrical optics,
but if it's high,

00:39:27.817 --> 00:39:29.820
long, short wavelength sound.
 

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.320
Suppose you're talking to your
dog, then you can talk to the

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.268
dog from here.
 

00:39:34.268 --> 00:39:38.179
At sufficiently high frequency,
the dog will hear it here.

00:39:38.179 --> 00:39:39.280
So it's a focusing effect.
 

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:43.947
So the way focusing works,
is that there's more than one

00:39:43.947 --> 00:39:46.750
way to go from start to finish.
 

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:48.789
But you are supposed to follow
the Principle of Least Time.

00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:52.230
That means all those paths take
the same time.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.639
That's the key.
 

00:39:53.639 --> 00:39:57.873
When you look at a mirror in
front of--an object in front of

00:39:57.873 --> 00:40:02.539
a mirror, there's only one path,
hit the mirror and bounce out.

00:40:02.539 --> 00:40:07.144
But if you have a geometry like
this one, curved,

00:40:07.144 --> 00:40:09.159
then it's not true.
 

00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:15.110
There is more than one way to
go from start to finish.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:25.139
Okay, so now let us ask how you
build a focusing mirror.

00:40:25.139 --> 00:40:26.659
Here's what we want to do.
 

00:40:26.659 --> 00:40:28.480
So this is not very practical.
 

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.170
This is very useful,
but it's not what I'm talking

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:36.614
about, because I didn't discuss
that in things you knew from

00:40:36.614 --> 00:40:37.820
high school.
 

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:43.949
Here's what you knew from high
school, how to make a focusing

00:40:43.949 --> 00:40:44.869
mirror.
 

00:40:44.869 --> 00:40:48.605
So the deal is,
light's going to come from some

00:40:48.605 --> 00:40:52.503
object at infinity,
therefore it's coming in some

00:40:52.503 --> 00:40:56.239
parallel lines from a very
distant object.

00:40:56.239 --> 00:41:01.813
You want to put some mirror of
some shape so that every one of

00:41:01.813 --> 00:41:06.110
these guys will come to the same
focal point.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:07.630
You can ask,
"Can I even design such a

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.920
thing?
 

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.780
Is it possible?
 

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.340
If so, what do I have to do?
 

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.820
What's the shape of the
object?"

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.050
So let's do the following.
 

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:20.710
Let's take the ray that goes
along the axis of this thing.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:23.579
It goes here.
 

00:41:23.579 --> 00:41:27.577
It goes to that mirror,
hits the mirror,

00:41:27.577 --> 00:41:31.780
then it comes back a distance
f.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.150
So in the time it takes to go
from here to here,

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.023
had it continued going,
it would have gone to this wall

00:41:39.023 --> 00:41:41.750
here, also at a distance
f.

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:43.480
Do you agree?
 

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.010
The time it takes for it to hit
the mirror and come to the focal

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:49.980
point is the same as the time it
would have taken,

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:54.786
but for the mirror,
to go the other side the same

00:41:54.786 --> 00:41:56.789
distance f.
 

00:41:56.789 --> 00:42:01.097
Okay, now I take a second ray
that's not on the symmetry axis,

00:42:01.097 --> 00:42:02.579
but above the axis.
 

00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:06.382
It comes here,
and having come here,

00:42:06.382 --> 00:42:11.708
if it has to take the same time
as the other beam,

00:42:11.708 --> 00:42:14.969
it's the time to go there.
 

00:42:14.969 --> 00:42:19.369
But you want it to instead come
here.

00:42:19.369 --> 00:42:22.250
So how will that happen?
 

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:26.719
What will ensure that that
happens?

00:42:26.719 --> 00:42:31.750
Can you guys think of what
condition you have?

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.449
Yes?
 

00:42:33.449 --> 00:42:36.079
Student:  The two
distances need to be the same.

00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:39.309
The distance from the mirror to
the--

00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:40.219
Prof: Do you understand
that?

00:42:40.219 --> 00:42:41.530
That's very important.
 

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:46.599
That distance and that distance
have to be equal.

00:42:46.599 --> 00:42:49.130
Let's be very clear on why we
are doing that.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:50.719
See, these guys came from
infinity.

00:42:50.719 --> 00:42:52.590
They've been traveling in a
parallel line.

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:56.103
Start with some plane here,
so that everybody is counted

00:42:56.103 --> 00:42:58.980
from now on and see how much
time you take.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:02.793
The ray from this center goes
to the mirror and goes an extra

00:43:02.793 --> 00:43:05.909
distance f,
because that's what it does.

00:43:05.909 --> 00:43:08.824
So that's the distance to which
any distance these rays would

00:43:08.824 --> 00:43:10.380
have gone, but for the mirror.
 

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.349
That's how much time you have.
 

00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:16.333
So if you went there and you
want to turn around and come

00:43:16.333 --> 00:43:18.228
here,
that extra distance better be

00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:20.460
equal to the distance to go to
that plane,

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:26.699
because that's the same time
for everything.

00:43:26.699 --> 00:43:30.420
So that's the condition of the
surface.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:35.096
It is a surface with a property
that its distance,

00:43:35.096 --> 00:43:40.057
any point on that curve,
has the same distance from a

00:43:40.057 --> 00:43:43.590
fixed point as from a fixed
line.

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:47.739
If you can find that,
that's the surface you want.

00:43:47.739 --> 00:43:50.409
Now that happens to be a
parabola, but we'll derive that,

00:43:50.409 --> 00:43:52.460
but that's what you learn in
high school.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:57.840
A parabola is a curve which is
equidistant from a point and

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.139
from a line.
 

00:43:59.139 --> 00:44:00.989
Distance to the point is very
clear.

00:44:00.989 --> 00:44:03.681
Distance to the line is
obtained by drawing a

00:44:03.681 --> 00:44:07.780
perpendicular and measuring that
distance, the shortest distance.

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.880
So I'm just going to equate
these two, that's it.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.940
That will give me the equation
for this curve.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.925
So let this graph,
the shape of the mirror I'm

00:44:14.925 --> 00:44:17.780
trying to design,
let this be the origin.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.594
This is some point with
coordinate x and

00:44:20.594 --> 00:44:24.204
y, and y is some
function of x that I'm

00:44:24.204 --> 00:44:25.550
going to find out.
 

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:26.119
That's the goal.
 

00:44:26.119 --> 00:44:29.489
What's the function y of
x that you want?

00:44:29.489 --> 00:44:35.550
So let's find out the different
distances.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:40.329
So what is that distance it has
to travel?

00:44:40.329 --> 00:44:43.768
You can see,
x is the coordinate of

00:44:43.768 --> 00:44:44.860
this point.
 

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.945
It's got to do that and another
extra f on the other

00:44:48.945 --> 00:44:49.440
side.
 

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.699
So going horizontally,
it's got to do an x here

00:44:52.699 --> 00:44:56.018
and an f there,
so it's got to do x f.

00:44:56.018 --> 00:45:01.510
That's the distance from the
mirror to this fictitious plane.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:03.239
That's the time they have.
 

00:45:03.239 --> 00:45:09.210
They all have the time to go to
this fictitious plane.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.820
So I'm going to equate that to
this distance.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.639
This one, you've got to use
Pythagoras' Theorem.

00:45:15.639 --> 00:45:20.139
So this height is y.
 

00:45:20.139 --> 00:45:26.030
So it's y^(2) (f −
x)^(2),

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:29.969
because this side here is f
- x,

00:45:29.969 --> 00:45:32.639
because the whole distance is
f and that's x.

00:45:32.639 --> 00:45:33.199
You follow that?
 

00:45:33.199 --> 00:45:35.389
(x,y) is the coordinate
of this point.

00:45:35.389 --> 00:45:36.590
You drop a line down here.
 

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:37.889
That distance is x.
 

00:45:37.889 --> 00:45:39.750
This is f - x and that's
y.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:40.679
That's that length.
 

00:45:40.679 --> 00:45:44.530
You want these two to be equal.
 

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:46.519
So if you have a square root,
you know what you have to do.

00:45:46.519 --> 00:45:48.039
You've got to square both sides.
 

00:45:48.039 --> 00:45:55.936
You square both sides,
you get x^(2) f^(2) 

00:45:55.936 --> 00:46:03.349
2xf = y^(2) (f −
x)^(2).

00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:11.717
So x^(2) cancels,
f^(2) cancels,

00:46:11.717 --> 00:46:18.969
then I get y^(2) =
4xf.

00:46:18.969 --> 00:46:21.880
That's the equation of the
parabola.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:26.751
You're probably used to drawing
parabolas that look like this,

00:46:26.751 --> 00:46:28.829
but it's the same thing.
 

00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:30.550
I've just turned it around.
 

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:35.648
So if you go a distance y
here, then this x is

00:46:35.648 --> 00:46:38.070
quadratic in the y.
 

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:41.155
So that's the equation,
that's the process by which you

00:46:41.155 --> 00:46:44.469
can design a mirror that will
focus light from infinity.

00:46:44.469 --> 00:46:47.420
So it can be done.
 

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.710
Likewise, if you said in the
elliptical case,

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:52.708
"Can I find a surface
inside which the distance will

00:46:52.708 --> 00:46:55.331
go from here to there after
touching the figure is

00:46:55.331 --> 00:46:57.579
independent of where I touch
it?"

00:46:57.579 --> 00:46:59.610
the equation you will get will
be an ellipse.

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:01.219
That's more complicated to
derive.

00:47:01.219 --> 00:47:02.530
This is a lot easier to derive.
 

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.639
This is the equation of the
parabola.

00:47:04.639 --> 00:47:09.010
So if you want to build a dish
that will really focus light,

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.898
no matter how far,
how wide the beam is,

00:47:11.898 --> 00:47:13.380
this will do it.
 

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.030
Parabolic mirrors is something
like what Hubble would use.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:18.869
Anybody would use parabolic
mirrors,

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:23.887
but there is a cheap trick
people use if they cannot afford

00:47:23.887 --> 00:47:26.788
a parabola,
because it's very hard to

00:47:26.788 --> 00:47:29.219
design things in a parabolic
shape.

00:47:29.219 --> 00:47:32.320
Do you know what the simplest
solution is?

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.849
It's a sphere.
 

00:47:33.849 --> 00:47:37.039
Now a sphere is not quite a
parabola,

00:47:37.039 --> 00:47:40.739
but you can imagine that if you
have a parabola like this,

00:47:40.739 --> 00:47:43.885
and have a sphere,
the sphere can sort of mimic

00:47:43.885 --> 00:47:46.280
the parabola up to some
distance.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.579
Then of course it will deviate.
 

00:47:48.579 --> 00:47:52.083
But if you promise that you'll
only take beams very near the

00:47:52.083 --> 00:47:54.766
axis,
then the two are just as good,

00:47:54.766 --> 00:47:59.108
except it's easier to make a
spherical mirror than to make a

00:47:59.108 --> 00:48:00.579
parabolic mirror.
 

00:48:00.579 --> 00:48:03.360
But if you've got the money,
parabola is what you want.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:06.550
Otherwise, this is the cheaper
solution.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.721
So let's ask ourselves the
following question:

00:48:09.721 --> 00:48:13.880
if I take a sphere of radius R
and I slice a part of it,

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.902
okay, it's a hollow sphere and
I slice a part of it and I paint

00:48:16.902 --> 00:48:19.050
it with silver,
so I've got a mirror,

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.505
this part of it,
what will be the focal length

00:48:21.505 --> 00:48:21.929
of that?
 

00:48:21.929 --> 00:48:25.679
That's what we are asking.
 

00:48:25.679 --> 00:48:31.653
I get that by saying the
following: so here is that

00:48:31.653 --> 00:48:32.730
sphere.
 

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:35.431
It's got radius R,
and there is some point

00:48:35.431 --> 00:48:37.409
(x,y) on that sphere.
 

00:48:37.409 --> 00:48:43.530
Then if this is my origin,
the equation for a sphere will

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:48.121
be (x −
R)^(2)  y^(2) =

00:48:48.121 --> 00:48:49.980
R^(2).
 

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:52.668
See, normally is x^(2)
y^(2) = R^(2),

00:48:52.668 --> 00:48:53.099
right?
 

00:48:53.099 --> 00:48:55.829
That's when the origin is at
the center of the sphere.

00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:59.777
But the center of this sphere
is at a point x = R,

00:48:59.777 --> 00:49:03.655
so the equation in this
coordinate system will look like

00:49:03.655 --> 00:49:04.289
this.
 

00:49:04.289 --> 00:49:12.137
So you open everything out,
you get x^(2) R^(2) - 2xr

00:49:12.137 --> 00:49:18.844
 y^(2) =
R^(2). You cancel the

00:49:18.844 --> 00:49:26.550
R^(2) and you get
y^(2) = 2xr x^(2).

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:31.621
I want you to compare this
equation to the equation for a

00:49:31.621 --> 00:49:33.070
real parabola.
 

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.679
They don't look the same.
 

00:49:34.679 --> 00:49:45.869
Yes?
 

00:49:45.869 --> 00:49:50.820
Student:
Yes, that's correct.

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.090
Yes.
 

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:56.440
Now the way to think about this
is that but for this

00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:00.367
−x^(2) term,
this equation looks like a

00:50:00.367 --> 00:50:03.360
parabola,
but if you compare the two,

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.409
you find that 4xf =
2xR.

00:50:06.409 --> 00:50:09.940
That means R = 2f.
 

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.530
Or, if you like,
the focal length is R/2.

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:15.577
But we're not done yet,
because I just threw away the

00:50:15.577 --> 00:50:16.130
second term.
 

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:19.610
I've got to give you a reason
for throwing the second term.

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:22.577
So here is where you've got to
get used to the following notion

00:50:22.577 --> 00:50:23.869
of big and small numbers.
 

00:50:23.869 --> 00:50:28.788
Whenever you deal with a mirror
or a lens, things like u,

00:50:28.788 --> 00:50:33.289
v, f are all going to be
treated as big numbers.

00:50:33.289 --> 00:50:38.088
Things like y that take
you off the axis are going to be

00:50:38.088 --> 00:50:40.179
considered small numbers.
 

00:50:40.179 --> 00:50:43.809
Things like x are even
smaller.

00:50:43.809 --> 00:50:49.072
So the hierarchy is,
u, v,

00:50:49.072 --> 00:50:54.335
f, big,
y is small,

00:50:54.335 --> 00:50:59.269
x is small squared.
 

00:50:59.269 --> 00:51:00.880
You can see that already.
 

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.239
Suppose someone tells you to
look at this equation.

00:51:04.239 --> 00:51:05.329
You can look at the two terms.
 

00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:08.336
One is x times R,
other is x times

00:51:08.336 --> 00:51:08.949
x.
 

00:51:08.949 --> 00:51:11.213
So x times R
beats x times x,

00:51:11.213 --> 00:51:13.760
because one is a small number,
one is a small number squared.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.900
So we're going to drop that
term.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.585
Then we get,
in that approximation,

00:51:18.585 --> 00:51:19.929
this condition.
 

00:51:19.929 --> 00:51:22.139
But that had to be such an
approximation,

00:51:22.139 --> 00:51:24.679
because a sphere can never
equal a parabola.

00:51:24.679 --> 00:51:28.132
It can look like a parabola
only for small deviations from

00:51:28.132 --> 00:51:28.800
the axis.
 

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:32.449
This is cautioning you that if
your rays come too far off,

00:51:32.449 --> 00:51:35.070
like way over there,
then the x times

00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:38.911
R term will be comparable
to the x^(2) term and it

00:51:38.911 --> 00:51:41.349
will no longer look like a
parabola.

00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:42.469
So you should be very clear.
 

00:51:42.469 --> 00:51:46.029
When you make a real parabolic
mirror, it will focus rays,

00:51:46.029 --> 00:51:48.840
no matter how far they are from
the origin.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.869
If I take a spherical
approximation to it,

00:51:51.869 --> 00:51:56.380
it will work only if the rays
are very close to the center.

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:59.050
So here's a spherical mirror.
 

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:02.585
You cannot have the rays going
too far from here,

00:52:02.585 --> 00:52:06.119
in the scale of u,
v and f. Yes?

00:52:06.119 --> 00:52:09.907
Student:  With the first
equation, if f = 0,

00:52:09.907 --> 00:52:11.170
isn't it a plane?
 

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:12.030
Prof: Yes.
 

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:15.887
Student:  But the focal
point isn't at the origin,

00:52:15.887 --> 00:52:16.440
is it?
 

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:19.990
Because the plane here has--
Prof: Yeah,

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:21.219
what did you want to do for
that one?

00:52:21.219 --> 00:52:25.336
Student:  If you put
f = 0,

00:52:25.336 --> 00:52:28.940
so you have the focal length =
0.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.059
Prof: Plane mirror is
focal length = infinity.

00:52:31.059 --> 00:52:32.434
Student:  Infinity.
 

00:52:32.434 --> 00:52:34.018
Oh, it's the other way around.
 

00:52:34.018 --> 00:52:34.389
Okay.
 

00:52:34.389 --> 00:52:36.286
Prof: It's the fact
there is bending that's focusing

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:36.449
it.
 

00:52:36.449 --> 00:52:39.659
As you straighten it out more
and more, it will just reflect

00:52:39.659 --> 00:52:40.909
it and go right back.
 

00:52:40.909 --> 00:52:42.079
And when will those lines meet?
 

00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:46.809
They'll meet at infinity.
 

00:52:46.809 --> 00:52:48.699
So I want to do one thing.
 

00:52:48.699 --> 00:52:50.389
I want to show you something.
 

00:52:50.389 --> 00:52:53.510
Here is a spherical mirror I've
cut out.

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:57.130
I want to send a parallel beam.
 

00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:01.548
I've already shown you that
this should go through the focal

00:53:01.548 --> 00:53:04.920
point, because it's the path of
least time.

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.911
But you can say,
"How do I know once again

00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:10.579
this is the same as i =
r?"

00:53:10.579 --> 00:53:13.690
Suppose you grew up on
incidence = reflection.

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:16.000
I'm not going to reassure you
continuously.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.610
I'm going to do it one last
time, okay?

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:20.849
Don't ever ask me again.
 

00:53:20.849 --> 00:53:22.139
It's the last time.
 

00:53:22.139 --> 00:53:24.869
I'm going to show you that
Principle of Least Time is the

00:53:24.869 --> 00:53:25.989
same as i = r.
 

00:53:25.989 --> 00:53:27.530
I don't want to do it over.
 

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:30.179
Here's the last time we're
going to do this.

00:53:30.179 --> 00:53:31.659
So what's our question?
 

00:53:31.659 --> 00:53:35.271
Question is,
if I draw a tangent to that

00:53:35.271 --> 00:53:39.440
graph and drew the normal to
that tangent,

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.452
right, we want to know that
that angle a will be

00:53:44.452 --> 00:53:47.329
equal to that angle b.
 

00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:49.489
That's what we want to show.
 

00:53:49.489 --> 00:53:51.630
But where will this go?
 

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:54.728
If that's a circle,
if it's a spherical mirror,

00:53:54.728 --> 00:53:58.434
you draw a normal to the
tangent, it will go through the

00:53:58.434 --> 00:54:00.119
center of the sphere.
 

00:54:00.119 --> 00:54:01.059
You understand?
 

00:54:01.059 --> 00:54:07.159
And this one is supposed to go
to the focal point.

00:54:07.159 --> 00:54:12.630
Now let this height be h.
 

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.920
Now let this angle is also
a.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:20.782
This figure is too small,
so let me draw you a bigger

00:54:20.782 --> 00:54:23.489
figure so you can see.
 

00:54:23.489 --> 00:54:29.148
This is sort of exaggerated so
you've got to be a little

00:54:29.148 --> 00:54:35.012
careful that the--let's call
that a and that's also

00:54:35.012 --> 00:54:36.349
a.
 

00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:38.670
Let's call this b.
 

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:41.150
This is f and this is
R.

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:42.260
I hope you understand why.
 

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:44.630
That's the important part.
 

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:48.059
This mirror is locally
tangential to that line,

00:54:48.059 --> 00:54:49.849
tangent to the circle.
 

00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:53.360
And the normal to the circle is
pointing towards the center.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.139
That's the way circles work.
 

00:54:55.139 --> 00:54:57.213
You draw a perpendicular from
the circumference,

00:54:57.213 --> 00:54:59.244
you hit the center,
but that's looking like the

00:54:59.244 --> 00:55:01.320
plane mirror for that particular
light ray.

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.949
That light ray doesn't care if
you bend it somewhere else.

00:55:03.949 --> 00:55:06.686
As far as this ray is
concerned, you are a plane

00:55:06.686 --> 00:55:07.210
mirror.
 

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:09.030
You want that angle to be equal
to that angle.

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:12.030
That's what I want to show you.
 

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:18.347
So let's take this height h
here, and you can notice that

00:55:18.347 --> 00:55:24.889
tan b = h/f and
tan a = h/R.

00:55:24.889 --> 00:55:26.030
Can you see that?
 

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:29.449
That's b and a?
 

00:55:29.449 --> 00:55:34.639
For small angles,
for a small angle,

00:55:34.639 --> 00:55:38.364
I remind you again and again,
sinθ is roughly

00:55:38.364 --> 00:55:41.371
θ and
tanθ is roughly

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:44.507
θ and
cosθ is roughly 1

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:47.579
corrections of order
θ^(2).

00:55:47.579 --> 00:55:50.280
So we delete the tan.
 

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:54.067
And if you use the fact that
R = 2f,

00:55:54.067 --> 00:55:58.010
it becomes h over
2f, you can see that

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:00.019
a = b/2.
 

00:56:00.019 --> 00:56:05.730
So a = b/2.
 

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:09.469
That means b is twice as
big as a,

00:56:09.469 --> 00:56:12.842
but in any triangle,
the external angle is sum of

00:56:12.842 --> 00:56:16.826
the internal opposite angles,
therefore if this is 2a

00:56:16.826 --> 00:56:21.949
and this guy is a,
that's also a.

00:56:21.949 --> 00:56:26.088
That means the angle of
incidence is the angle of

00:56:26.088 --> 00:56:27.210
reflection.
 

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:31.601
So what I'm telling you is,
you can always go back to angle

00:56:31.601 --> 00:56:34.480
of incidence = angle of
reflection,

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.518
but it's going to take more
work because you have to find

00:56:37.518 --> 00:56:38.280
the tangent.
 

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.289
You've got to draw the normal
to the tangent.

00:56:40.289 --> 00:56:42.920
You've got to find the angle
with respect to that normal and

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.170
equate it with that angle.
 

00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:47.989
You will find in fact every ray
goes through f.

00:56:47.989 --> 00:56:53.039
But it works only in the small
angle approximation.

00:56:53.039 --> 00:56:58.612
The small angle basically means
your object is not too tall

00:56:58.612 --> 00:57:02.360
compared to the radius of the
mirror.

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.650
That's because if the object is
comparable, then the

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:09.005
approximation I made that a
circle will approximate a

00:57:09.005 --> 00:57:11.070
parabola is no longer valid.
 

00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:13.170
So remember,
if you took a real parabola,

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:15.690
if you have the stomach,
you can do the following

00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:16.530
calculation.
 

00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:19.440
Take a real parabola,
you will find angle of

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.349
incidence is angle of reflection
exactly.

00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:24.230
Whenever you draw a line,
horizontal line,

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:26.340
that hits the mirror,
comes to the focal point,

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:28.599
if you find the local value of
the perpendicular,

00:57:28.599 --> 00:57:31.860
you'll find i = r,
no matter how far you go.

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.900
But if you approximate it by a
spherical mirror,

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.025
we have seen,
the spherical mirror is only an

00:57:36.025 --> 00:57:39.981
approximation to the parabola,
when you can drop the

00:57:39.981 --> 00:57:42.119
x^(2) term.
 

00:57:42.119 --> 00:57:47.577
Okay, so we have seen the
Principle of Least Time is able

00:57:47.577 --> 00:57:52.742
to give us i = r,
Snell's law and focusing of a

00:57:52.742 --> 00:57:54.010
parabola.
 

00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:57.525
Now I want to consider the
following thing:

00:57:57.525 --> 00:58:02.465
just because a parabola can
focus light ray at infinity to a

00:58:02.465 --> 00:58:07.739
focal point does not mean if you
put a finite object at a finite

00:58:07.739 --> 00:58:13.550
distance from it,
it will form a clear image.

00:58:13.550 --> 00:58:16.039
It's only an approximation.
 

00:58:16.039 --> 00:58:19.338
And I will show you what we
normally get from geometrical

00:58:19.338 --> 00:58:19.869
optics.
 

00:58:19.869 --> 00:58:22.380
I'll remind you what we know
from geometrical optics.

00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:24.516
Geometrical optics tells you
the following:

00:58:24.516 --> 00:58:27.414
if you have an object of height
h at a distance u from the

00:58:27.414 --> 00:58:30.670
mirror and you want to know
where the image will be formed,

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:34.559
you first draw a horizontal
line whose fate you know.

00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:39.389
It has to go through the focal
point.

00:58:39.389 --> 00:58:43.289
The second one says you draw a
line through the focal point and

00:58:43.289 --> 00:58:45.429
it's got to come out horizontal.
 

00:58:45.429 --> 00:58:47.139
How do I know that?
 

00:58:47.139 --> 00:58:49.900
I know that if I run the ray
backwards,

00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:53.050
a horizontal ray will go
through the focal point,

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:55.889
but if going backwards,
it's a good idea,

00:58:55.889 --> 00:58:59.947
namely least time,
it's also a good idea going

00:58:59.947 --> 00:59:00.849
forward.
 

00:59:00.849 --> 00:59:04.869
That's why we know that
parallel will go through focus.

00:59:04.869 --> 00:59:06.610
Through focus it will come out
parallel.

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:10.969
So you join them and you've got
the image there.

00:59:10.969 --> 00:59:20.170
And that's at a distance
v at a height

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:24.980
h_2.
 

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:28.969
So I'm now going to use ideas
of geometrical optics,

00:59:28.969 --> 00:59:32.112
having shown you enough times
that least time and geometrical

00:59:32.112 --> 00:59:34.409
optics are equal,
to find the usual relation

00:59:34.409 --> 00:59:38.300
between u,
v and f.

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:40.099
So how do we do that?
 

00:59:40.099 --> 00:59:45.963
We say, take that triangle with
angle alpha and that with angle

00:59:45.963 --> 00:59:50.030
alpha and draw a triangle like
this here.

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:54.139
Then you equate tangent of this
angle to tangent of that angle.

00:59:54.139 --> 01:00:04.097
Then you find tanα
= h_1 divided

01:00:04.097 --> 01:00:08.994
by u - f,
that distance,

01:00:08.994 --> 01:00:13.730
= h_2/f.
 

01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:15.260
Actually, there's a tiny bit.
 

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.289
It's not quite f.
 

01:00:16.289 --> 01:00:19.059
It's (f −
x)^(2), but x^(2) is

01:00:19.059 --> 01:00:22.679
negligible compared to f,
so we won't worry about that.

01:00:22.679 --> 01:00:26.340
You see this triangle here?
 

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.860
That height is certainly
h_2.

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.460
That length is not quite
f.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.324
f goes all the way to
the mirror, but if I drop a

01:00:32.324 --> 01:00:34.876
perpendicular here,
there's a tiny little x

01:00:34.876 --> 01:00:35.449
inside.
 

01:00:35.449 --> 01:00:36.590
I'm now showing you that
x.

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:38.719
I've been neglecting it.
 

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:41.130
In other words,
you really should put an f -

01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:43.907
x, but x is quadratic
in the small numbers,

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:45.690
so we're not going to keep it.
 

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:48.300
Then draw another similar
triangle.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.730
This angle β
is the same as this angle

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:53.679
β.
 

01:00:53.679 --> 01:00:58.610
So let's say tan β
found two ways it's equal.

01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:01.730
This one, tan β
on the top,

01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:05.530
you can see is the
h_1/f

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:10.139
and that's going to = the tan
β of this triangle,

01:01:10.139 --> 01:01:15.284
which will be
h_2 divided by

01:01:15.284 --> 01:01:17.039
v - f.
 

01:01:17.039 --> 01:01:18.610
These are the two conditions
you get.

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:37.219
 
 

01:01:37.219 --> 01:01:39.920
Okay, I may want to draw bigger
pictures.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.409
Can you guys see this,
or there's no hope?

01:01:42.409 --> 01:01:44.429
Can you see in the last row?
 

01:01:44.429 --> 01:01:45.349
Cannot.
 

01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:48.695
You should tell me when you
cannot, because I'll be happy to

01:01:48.695 --> 01:01:49.320
fix that.
 

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.340
So let me draw this bigger.
 

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:54.010
The reason that I'm drawing
everything small is that I don't

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:56.728
want the rays to go too far up
the axis, but I'm not going to

01:01:56.728 --> 01:01:57.679
worry about that.
 

01:01:57.679 --> 01:01:59.380
So let's make sure you can see
the rays.

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:06.074
There's one guy who did that,
one which did that,

01:02:06.074 --> 01:02:07.469
correct?
 

01:02:07.469 --> 01:02:11.971
This is α
and that is α

01:02:11.971 --> 01:02:17.400
and this is β
and this is β`.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.679
That's all I've done now.
 

01:02:19.679 --> 01:02:23.976
So tan α
= h_1 divided

01:02:23.976 --> 01:02:26.902
by this side,
where u is the distance

01:02:26.902 --> 01:02:29.077
from the mirror,
you take away f,

01:02:29.077 --> 01:02:32.797
because that's f. That's
h_1 over u -

01:02:32.797 --> 01:02:33.329
f.
 

01:02:33.329 --> 01:02:36.690
It's the same as tan alpha
measured on this triangle.

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:38.641
That tan α
is

01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:43.630
h_2/f -
a tiny portion,

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:48.619
which is the x,
which I'm dropping.

01:02:48.619 --> 01:02:51.239
But similarly for β,
you have a similar rule.

01:02:51.239 --> 01:02:55.659
So here's all you can get out
of these two rays.

01:02:55.659 --> 01:03:04.505
So let's multiply this one and
this one and that one and that

01:03:04.505 --> 01:03:05.389
one.
 

01:03:05.389 --> 01:03:08.791
So I'll get
h_1h_2

01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:12.449
over u - f times v
- f.

01:03:12.449 --> 01:03:14.889
I'm going to cross multiply
like that.

01:03:14.889 --> 01:03:18.217
It =
h_1h_2

01:03:18.217 --> 01:03:20.639
over f^(2).
 

01:03:20.639 --> 01:03:26.353
That tells you,
u - f times v - f

01:03:26.353 --> 01:03:29.210
= f^(2).
 

01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:32.438
You may not have seen it this
way, but it's a very symmetric

01:03:32.438 --> 01:03:33.969
way to write the equation.
 

01:03:33.969 --> 01:03:37.353
If you measure all distances,
not from this point here but

01:03:37.353 --> 01:03:41.034
from the focal point,
then it says u - f times

01:03:41.034 --> 01:03:43.510
v - f equals
f^(2).

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:45.670
But let's make contact with
what we all know.

01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:51.885
So let's open out the brackets,
so I get uv - uf - vf f

01:03:51.885 --> 01:03:55.050
squared = f^(2).
 

01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:57.670
You cancel that guy.
 

01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:04.679
Then you get uf vf =
uv.

01:04:04.679 --> 01:04:10.699
Now divide everything by
uvf.

01:04:10.699 --> 01:04:20.565
You divided everything by
uvf, you'll get 1/v

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:23.489
1/u = 1/f.
 

01:04:23.489 --> 01:04:27.030
Anyway, this is derived by
standard geometrical optics,

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:30.440
without going back to the
Principle of Least Time.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.329
So this is the result.
 

01:04:31.329 --> 01:04:33.596
But there's one more result,
because you've got two

01:04:33.596 --> 01:04:35.500
equations, you can learn one
more thing.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.599
You can ask yourself,
what's the ratio of the object

01:04:38.599 --> 01:04:40.119
size to the image size?
 

01:04:40.119 --> 01:04:43.659
You can say,
what is h_2/h

01:04:43.659 --> 01:04:45.429
_1?
 

01:04:45.429 --> 01:04:49.282
So
h_2/h_1

01:04:49.282 --> 01:04:54.219
is f divided by u
-f.

01:04:54.219 --> 01:04:55.760
Or let me write it another way,
it's easier.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:01.746
h_1/h_2
= (u −

01:05:01.746 --> 01:05:03.090
f)/f.
 

01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:07.710
That's equal to u/f - 1.
 

01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:13.010
u/f is u times
1/f and 1/f is

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:16.230
1/u  1 over v - 1.
 

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:21.295
And if you do that,
you'll find it's just u

01:05:21.295 --> 01:05:22.949
over v.
 

01:05:22.949 --> 01:05:26.465
So the ratio of the object size
to the image size is just the

01:05:26.465 --> 01:05:29.570
ratio of the object distance to
the image distance.

01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:33.722
And people sometimes define a
magnification M to be

01:05:33.722 --> 01:05:35.179
−u/v.
 

01:05:35.179 --> 01:05:38.626
What they mean by the - sign is
that if this comes out negative,

01:05:38.626 --> 01:05:40.980
the object is in the upside
down version.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:45.170
The image is an upside down
version of the object.

01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:47.487
In this problem u and
v are both positive,

01:05:47.487 --> 01:05:49.130
then M will come out
negative.

01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:54.219
It just means it is that much
bigger, but flipped upside down.

01:05:54.219 --> 01:05:56.764
In some other mirrors,
you will find v is

01:05:56.764 --> 01:05:58.929
negative because the image is
virtual.

01:05:58.929 --> 01:06:00.929
Then it will mean M is
positive.

01:06:00.929 --> 01:06:02.630
That means the object is
upright.

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:06.842
That's when you look into the
mirror, the bathroom mirror,

01:06:06.842 --> 01:06:10.760
then your image has the same
orientation as your face,

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.239
not upside down.
 

01:06:12.239 --> 01:06:16.980
Then M will be positive.
 

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:20.809
Okay, now here's a question one
can ask.

01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:25.164
When you do geometric optics,
there's a question one can ask,

01:06:25.164 --> 01:06:28.719
which usually occurs about 30
years afterwards.

01:06:28.719 --> 01:06:30.050
I never asked that question.
 

01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:32.289
I kept doing all the problems.
 

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:35.753
Then a few years ago,
when I started teaching this

01:06:35.753 --> 01:06:39.922
course, I began to ask myself,
you know, you can always draw

01:06:39.922 --> 01:06:42.679
two rays and they will always
meet.

01:06:42.679 --> 01:06:45.199
What if I draw another one?
 

01:06:45.199 --> 01:06:51.030
What if I draw one that goes
like this?

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:52.000
How do I know it will come here?
 

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.090
A lot of pictures show you that
coming here, but should it come

01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:55.440
here?
 

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.320
Maybe it won't,
so let me check this thing.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.077
Let me make sure that if I have
a ray coming to the center of

01:07:03.077 --> 01:07:06.710
this, it will also end up where
the other two guys came.

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:09.960
Well, if you do the center,
remember, it's angle of

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:13.925
incidence = angle of reflection,
that means the tangent of the

01:07:13.925 --> 01:07:15.289
angles are equal.
 

01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:17.815
That means h_1/u
should be

01:07:17.815 --> 01:07:19.320
h_2/v.
 

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.945
Luckily that happens to be
true, because

01:07:21.945 --> 01:07:25.920
h_1/h_2
is in fact u/v.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:31.260
Thereby you can show that this
ray, which hits the center of

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:35.969
the mirror, will also come to
where this one came.

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:38.777
But that's not enough,
because somebody can draw yet

01:07:38.777 --> 01:07:40.650
another one and yet another one.
 

01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:44.630
How do you know they will all
come to the same focal point?

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:48.030
How will you know they're all
from the same image?

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:50.340
Do you understand the question
now?

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:53.621
You have to show that every ray
leaving that source hits the

01:07:53.621 --> 01:07:56.570
mirror and comes back to the
very same image point.

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:59.882
And it's not enough to draw two
rays and show them meeting,

01:07:59.882 --> 01:08:01.940
because two rays will always
meet.

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:05.012
Now I've drawn a third one and
shown you that it certainly

01:08:05.012 --> 01:08:07.710
comes to the right place,
but that's not enough.

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:13.528
You can sort of argue that the
evidence is overwhelming it will

01:08:13.528 --> 01:08:17.434
come here,
because if you look at all the

01:08:17.434 --> 01:08:21.996
rays fanning out of this,
the one that went to the top

01:08:21.996 --> 01:08:22.840
came here.
 

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.750
One that went to the bottom and
also came here,

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:25.829
but that's pretty solid.
 

01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:27.460
This involves the focal point.
 

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.868
One in the middle also came to
the same point.

01:08:29.868 --> 01:08:32.667
You can sort of say,
"Look, this end is good,

01:08:32.667 --> 01:08:35.409
that end is good,
point in the middle is good.

01:08:35.409 --> 01:08:37.390
What do you think will happen?
 

01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:38.050
We don't know.
 

01:08:38.050 --> 01:08:41.359
Sometimes it can happen that
there are three points which are

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.399
good, but everything else is
wrong.

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:46.560
So what is the way to nail this
thing?

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.195
I'm not going to do it today,
but I want you to think about

01:08:50.195 --> 01:08:53.895
what calculation will satisfy
you that no matter where I hit

01:08:53.895 --> 01:08:56.930
the mirror,
I will get the same time.

01:08:56.930 --> 01:09:00.359
What do you think I have to do?
 

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:08.590
What would you do?
 

01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:09.609
What do you want to check?
 

01:09:09.609 --> 01:09:10.448
Yes?
 

01:09:10.448 --> 01:09:14.086
Student:  You can make
the object infinitely small

01:09:14.086 --> 01:09:15.840
&gt;
 

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.722
Prof: Yes,
if you make the object

01:09:17.722 --> 01:09:19.895
infinitely small,
perhaps every ray will start

01:09:19.895 --> 01:09:20.909
looking parallel.
 

01:09:20.909 --> 01:09:21.828
That's correct.
 

01:09:21.828 --> 01:09:26.462
Student:  You can take
infinitely small pieces

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.868
&gt;
 

01:09:28.868 --> 01:09:31.550
Prof: No,
I think I'll explain what my

01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:32.829
question really is.
 

01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:34.130
Then you can think about it.
 

01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:36.038
Here is the mirror, right?
 

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:39.085
I took an object here,
that's the focal point,

01:09:39.085 --> 01:09:42.672
and I draw some number of rays,
three of them in fact,

01:09:42.672 --> 01:09:43.350
right?
 

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:51.560
This one, that one and one
through the center.

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.229
They all came.
 

01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:57.912
If I want to show you that if I
took an arbitrary point at

01:09:57.912 --> 01:09:59.399
height y--yes.
 

01:09:59.399 --> 01:10:00.676
Student:  Create an
ellipse based off of the two

01:10:00.676 --> 01:10:00.890
points.
 

01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:01.529
Prof: Pardon me?
 

01:10:01.529 --> 01:10:03.902
Student:  Could you
create a function for an ellipse

01:10:03.902 --> 01:10:04.720
off of two points?
 

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.288
Prof: Yes.
 

01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:10.854
What you have to do is to pick
a random generic point on that

01:10:10.854 --> 01:10:13.805
graph,
not a parabola,

01:10:13.805 --> 01:10:21.985
and ask how long it will take
light to go to that point and

01:10:21.985 --> 01:10:23.819
come here.
 

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:25.448
So what do I want to show?
 

01:10:25.448 --> 01:10:29.680
Every ray of light hitting this
is going to end up here,

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:30.448
correct?
 

01:10:30.448 --> 01:10:36.622
For every possible altitude,
all the way from 0 to the full

01:10:36.622 --> 01:10:37.578
height.
 

01:10:37.578 --> 01:10:40.252
Now in order to show that it
will come here,

01:10:40.252 --> 01:10:43.858
it also has to be a path of
least time, because you need to

01:10:43.858 --> 01:10:45.908
go in the path of least time.
 

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:48.439
These three guys are obviously
path of least time,

01:10:48.439 --> 01:10:49.989
the three rays I showed you.
 

01:10:49.989 --> 01:10:51.649
I want you never to forget that.
 

01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:54.012
If three rays leave here and
they meet here,

01:10:54.012 --> 01:10:57.364
that means they take the same
time, because light travels in a

01:10:57.364 --> 01:10:58.630
path of least time.
 

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:01.319
If three guys get there,
they all take the same time.

01:11:01.319 --> 01:11:06.015
But it's not enough to consider
that height, 0 height and that

01:11:06.015 --> 01:11:06.710
height.
 

01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:08.408
I only took a height
h_2,

01:11:08.408 --> 01:11:09.609
h_1 and 0.
 

01:11:09.609 --> 01:11:13.006
I want to take a generic height
y, and I want to

01:11:13.006 --> 01:11:16.529
calculate that distance,
divided by velocity of light.

01:11:16.529 --> 01:11:20.921
Just take that distance that
distance and show that the

01:11:20.921 --> 01:11:23.930
answer does not depend on
y.

01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:26.146
The answer does not depend on
y, then you vary any

01:11:26.146 --> 01:11:26.939
y you like.
 

01:11:26.939 --> 01:11:31.630
Then you get the same time.
 

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:33.951
So I'm not going to do the
calculation, but I want you to

01:11:33.951 --> 01:11:35.899
think about what it is you want
to calculate.

01:11:35.899 --> 01:11:39.323
I'm going to set it up,
but then come back next time

01:11:39.323 --> 01:11:42.010
and do it, because it takes some
time.

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:46.145
I'm going to exaggerate
everything so you can sort of

01:11:46.145 --> 01:11:49.010
see what we are trying to do
here.

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:52.002
You want to go to that guy,
not at that height

01:11:52.002 --> 01:11:54.000
h_1,
sorry.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.305
I want to pick an arbitrary
height y,

01:11:58.305 --> 01:12:02.109
then I wanted to form an image
here.

01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:04.990
So that's at u,
that's at v,

01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:07.100
that's h_2.
 

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:11.277
I want to find that distance
and I want to find that distance

01:12:11.277 --> 01:12:14.341
and add them up,
and the answer should be the

01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:16.500
same as any of the winners.
 

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:21.356
The winner I want to take is
this guy, which came like this,

01:12:21.356 --> 01:12:24.649
which I know is one of the
least time.

01:12:24.649 --> 01:12:28.694
If you want,
that corresponds to y =

01:12:28.694 --> 01:12:29.078
0.
 

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:32.916
So the time we are trying to
match is really

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:36.128
h_1^(2)
u^(2)

01:12:36.128 --> 01:12:40.412
h_2^(2) 
v^(2) divided by

01:12:40.412 --> 01:12:43.158
c,
but I'm not going to divide by

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:43.600
c.
 

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.319
Just imagine everywhere we're
dividing by c.

01:12:46.319 --> 01:12:50.470
The path length for this path
that goes to the middle of the

01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:53.934
mirror and comes out,
you can see from Pythagoras'

01:12:53.934 --> 01:12:56.721
Theorem's h_1^(2 )
u^(2) and

01:12:56.721 --> 01:12:58.939
h_2^(2 ) v^(2).
 

01:12:58.939 --> 01:13:02.329
And that's going to be equal to
this length

01:13:02.329 --> 01:13:05.801
d_1_ 
this length

01:13:05.801 --> 01:13:07.819
d_2.
 

01:13:07.819 --> 01:13:09.750
And they will depend on
y.

01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:12.078
d_1 and
d_2 will depend

01:13:12.078 --> 01:13:12.658
on y.
 

01:13:12.658 --> 01:13:15.789
And we want to expand it as a
function of y and make

01:13:15.789 --> 01:13:18.811
sure it doesn't vary with
y, and I'll tell you the

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.000
details next time.
 

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000

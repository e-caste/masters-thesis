RONALD SMITH: Well, today I'm
going to finish up a two-lecture

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.500
description of paleoclimatology
and the ice

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.267
ages, and then starting on
Friday, I'll go into the

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:17.067
subject of global warming.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:22.467
And I'll be lecturing about that
Friday, next Monday, and

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:23.800
then you have your exam.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.967
I may even be continuing
that subject on

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:28.033
the following Friday.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:31.667
So we're going to spend about
a week on global warming.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:34.900
And it's a very controversial
subject, very interesting

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.300
scientifically, politically,
socially.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.100
And we've laid a good foundation
for studying it.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.567
All the things we've studied
up until this moment,

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:49.167
including this stuff, I think
will help us as we try to

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:53.167
struggle with this issue
of global warming.

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:55.567
So any questions there?

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:02.333
If not, so you remember, we
started this last time.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.333
And I'm just going to flick
through so these are the

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.667
subjects we're doing.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:12.333
And I did these first
three last time.

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:17.033
Today we're going to finish up
the remaining four subjects

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:20.300
within this general area.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.933
So just to flash everything
by you.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.767
We talked about the last
glacial maximum.

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:33.533
We got here.

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:38.467
So let me put a couple things
up on the board just to

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:39.733
reinforce what's here.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.167
Hydrogen has a nucleus with one
proton, therefore it has a

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:56.700
single positive charge and
typically has one electron

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.367
with a negative charge
going around it.

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:06.267
There are two famous isotopes
of hydrogen.

00:02:06.267 --> 00:02:09.067
One is deuterium, and
one is tritium.

00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:11.067
I'm not going to talk about
tritium today, but I'm going

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:14.300
to talk about deuterium.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.133
It has one proton
and one neutron.

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:19.333
This has a mass of one.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:21.167
This has a mass of two.

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:24.700
But notice it still has just one
positive charge, so it has

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.467
just one electron
going around it.

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:30.167
So chemically, the two
are identical.

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:33.900
They have the same electronic
orbitals, and they'll bond and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900
so on in just the way--in
the same way that

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.933
the other one does.

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:44.033
The other one I want to
think about is oxygen.

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:50.867
Oxygen typically has eight
protons and eight neutrons.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.900
Because of eight protons, it
has eight positive charges.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.867
It'll have eight electrons
going around it.

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.067
And that will determine its
chemical properties.

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:07.800
And this would be called
oxygen 16.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.733
Sorry.

00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:13.833
Oxygen 16, because that
mass adds up to

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:17.100
16 atomic mass units.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.733
The other one we're interested
in has 8 protons and 10

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:25.867
neutrons, adding up
to a mass of 18.

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:30.000
Still has eight protons,
therefore has eight electrons.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.067
Same chemical properties, but a
different mass, and this one

00:03:34.067 --> 00:03:37.067
is called oxygen 18.

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:42.100
And by convention, that mass
number is put to the upper

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:52.300
left of the letter symbol
for that element.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.500
So oxygen 16 and oxygen 18.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.733
Now, we're interested
in water.

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:03.100
So the question is what water
molecules can we make from

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.067
these isotopes?

00:04:04.067 --> 00:04:08.567
And by far the most common would
be normal H2O, which

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:16.167
would have oxygen 16 plus two
hydrogens coming off it.

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:18.733
Water vapor has a
dihedral shape.

00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:20.367
It's not a linear molecule.

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:24.333
The hydrogens droop off
it at an angle.

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:28.633
That's by far the most common,
because this is much more

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:34.233
common than that by a factor
of 1,000 or so.

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:36.300
And this is much more common
than that by a

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.333
factor of 1,000 or so.

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:44.100
So if you just randomly put
these molecules--these atoms

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.367
together to form molecules,
almost everything is going to

00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:53.067
be like this, but there are
going to be some that have

00:04:53.067 --> 00:05:00.700
this structure where you replace
one of the hydrogens

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.133
with a deuterium.

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:06.967
Notice that this has a mass
of 18, because it's

00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:10.667
16 plus 1 plus 1.

00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:15.067
This is going to have a mass
of 19, because it's

00:05:15.067 --> 00:05:19.367
16 plus 2 plus 1.

00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:22.500
And then the other one is where
you replace the oxygen

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.933
16 with oxygen 18 but keep both
of these as hydrogens.

00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:30.200
That's going to be 18, 19, 20.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.033
So that's going to have
a mass of 20.

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:35.567
Now you can imagine others.

00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:40.133
For example, you could replace
both of the hydrogens with

00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:44.000
deuterium, but that would
be so rare that I'm not

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.033
interested in it.

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:48.767
Or you could replace the oxygen
16 by 18 and one of the

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:53.300
hydrogens by deuterium, but
again, that is so rare that

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.967
I'm not interested in it.

00:05:54.967 --> 00:05:57.333
So I'm going to just
limit myself

00:05:57.333 --> 00:06:02.233
to these three isotopes.

00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:05.833
This would be called the normal,
and these would be the

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:06.633
heavier ones.

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:08.567
And we keep track
of the ratio.

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:12.167
For example, if you're comparing
these in a sample,

00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:15.000
you would measure
the D/H ratio.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.433
Or if you're comparing these
two, you would take the ratio

00:06:21.433 --> 00:06:26.500
of oxygen 18 to oxygen 16.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.900
And the higher this is, you
would say--the common

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.933
terminology is that the water
is heavy if it has a large

00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:38.833
deuterium to hydrogen ratio,
or it's heavy if it has a

00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:43.967
large oxygen 18 to oxygen 16
ratio, or light if it's got a

00:06:43.967 --> 00:06:47.100
lower than usual ratio
of deuterium.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.800
So I'm going to be using these
terms heavy and light in a

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.633
relative fashion to describe
whether these ratios are

00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:02.800
typical for ocean water or
larger or smaller than that.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.633
So I hope you've Googled or gone
back to your high school

00:07:07.633 --> 00:07:10.367
or college chemistry book
and reviewed this.

00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:17.267
Now, isotopes also appear some
isotopes are so-called

00:07:17.267 --> 00:07:18.733
radiogenic isotopes.

00:07:18.733 --> 00:07:23.133
They are temporary isotopes that
can be formed by nuclear

00:07:23.133 --> 00:07:25.600
reaction and then decay
automatically

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.033
with some half life.

00:07:28.033 --> 00:07:31.967
Those are called unstable,
or radiogenic, isotopes.

00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:34.533
And maybe those are the isotopes
you've heard about

00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:36.667
before, but I'm not talking
about those.

00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:40.700
These are called stable
isotopes, because they remain.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.933
They don't have any
natural decay.

00:07:43.933 --> 00:07:48.467
They just exist in these
different mass forms, and they

00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:53.733
persist over millions and
billions of years.

00:07:53.733 --> 00:07:55.033
So these are the stable
isotopes--in this case, I

00:07:55.033 --> 00:07:58.200
would call these the stable
isotopes of water, which is

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.500
what I've labeled this slide.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.767
Any questions on that?

00:08:06.367 --> 00:08:11.700
So now for our purposes, it's
very important to know that

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:17.233
the heavier isotopes, these
two, have a slightly lower

00:08:17.233 --> 00:08:19.167
vapor pressure.

00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:21.867
Because they're heavier, they
move a little more slowly in

00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:26.200
the liquid, which means they
evaporate more slowly than

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.967
this, but they would
condense more

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:32.867
readily than normal water.

00:08:32.867 --> 00:08:35.767
Therefore, when you do get a
phase change, when you get

00:08:35.767 --> 00:08:40.100
vapor going to liquid or you
get liquid going to vapor,

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.900
there will be a fractionation.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.733
This is the other new word.

00:08:43.733 --> 00:08:47.000
A fractionation means a process
where you change the

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.500
ratios of these two things.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.133
For example, if you had a bucket
of nuts in your room

00:08:55.133 --> 00:08:59.733
peanuts and cashews and your
roommate happened to be a

00:08:59.733 --> 00:09:05.167
cashew lover, so when she was
grabbing a fistful of nuts,

00:09:05.167 --> 00:09:08.967
she would tend to get one that
had more cashews in it, that's

00:09:08.967 --> 00:09:10.333
a fractionation process.

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:13.833
What's being left behind then
is going to be a little bit

00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:19.600
heavier, a little more enriched
in the peanuts and a

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.400
little bit more depleted in
the cashews, because she's

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.800
grabbing out her
favorite nuts.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.967
That's what's going on when
you're evaporating or

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:29.167
condensing water.

00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:33.433
You're changing the ratio of
peanuts to cashews by the way

00:09:33.433 --> 00:09:37.400
you're doing that thermodynamic
transformation,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:43.400
vapor to liquid or liquid
back to vapor.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.200
That's what we're going
to be tracking today.

00:09:48.367 --> 00:09:52.067
Now, the way we keep track of
these ratios is with the

00:09:52.067 --> 00:09:54.100
so-called called
delta notation.

00:09:57.067 --> 00:10:02.667
We have to define a reference
ratio of D/H. And that's

00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:04.967
standard mean ocean water.

00:10:04.967 --> 00:10:07.800
It's basically a sample
of several

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.967
places around the ocean.

00:10:08.967 --> 00:10:13.900
They collect, mix them all
together, and store large

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.600
volumes of it in laboratories,
and use that as a reference

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.333
every time they're doing an
isotope ratio measurement.

00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:25.833
So that's called--the
abbreviation for that is SMOW,

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:28.633
standard mean ocean water.

00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:34.767
Then you measure the D/H ratio
in the sample of interest,

00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:40.800
divide it by the D/H ratio in
your reference liquid, SMOW,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.633
subtract 1, multiply by 1,000,
and that is so-called the

00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:47.000
delta D value.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.233
If it's deuterium, it's delta
D. If you do the same thing

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:55.633
with oxygen, it's the
delta O-18 value.

00:10:55.633 --> 00:10:58.033
And that's what we'll
be tracking.

00:10:58.033 --> 00:11:00.467
So notice the way this
is subtracted.

00:11:00.467 --> 00:11:05.667
So if you had a sample that had
a larger ratio of D/H than

00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:09.800
the reference, that would end
up being a positive number.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.200
And we would call that--

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.600
we'd say the sample is
heavier than SMOW.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.433
If the D/H ratio is less than
the standard, then the number

00:11:19.433 --> 00:11:22.000
is going to turn out to be
negative, and we're going to

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.967
say that sample is lighter
than SMOW.

00:11:26.967 --> 00:11:30.967
This quantity is usually stated
as per mill or written

00:11:30.967 --> 00:11:36.300
not with a percent sign but with
a percent sign with two

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.567
zeros on the bottom.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.833
So again, a reservoir of liquid
water under evaporation

00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:49.600
will become isotopically heavier
because the lighter

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.600
isotopes will evaporate
more readily.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.767
A reservoir of water vapor
imagine some water vapor in

00:11:56.767 --> 00:12:00.433
this room, and we're condensing
out some of it

00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:04.900
that's going to be isotopically
heavier--sorry,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.433
lighter, because the heavier
isotopes are condensing out

00:12:08.433 --> 00:12:10.567
and leaving preferentially.

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:17.767
You can do these experiments
in the laboratory.

00:12:17.767 --> 00:12:20.267
You could take a
dish of water.

00:12:20.267 --> 00:12:21.733
Take a sample from it.

00:12:21.733 --> 00:12:23.967
Put it into a mass spectrometer
to determine the

00:12:23.967 --> 00:12:25.400
isotope ratios.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.233
Then let it sit there
for a few days

00:12:27.233 --> 00:12:29.833
and partially evaporate.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:31.933
And when you came back and took
another sample of the

00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:37.900
liquid that would be this case
and again put it on the mass

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.200
spectrometer to get the isotope
ratio, it would be

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.400
heavier--isotopically heavier,
because the lighter isotopes

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.700
would have evaporated
preferentially.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.267
So it's an easy thing to do in
the laboratory to measure this

00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:57.800
physical process called
isotope fractionation.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.867
Now, in the real world, if you
start with an ocean value of

00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:08.467
zero, the delta D value, or the
delta O-18 value would be

00:13:08.467 --> 00:13:11.833
zero, which is likely, right,
because ocean is our modern

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:16.133
reference for isotope ratio.

00:13:16.133 --> 00:13:19.767
So typically, the delta values
for modern ocean are going to

00:13:19.767 --> 00:13:22.967
be very close to zero.

00:13:22.967 --> 00:13:25.733
When you evaporate, the
isotopes--the lighter isotopes

00:13:25.733 --> 00:13:29.500
evaporate preferentially, and
so the vapor you have in the

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.000
atmosphere is typically going to
be lighter than the ocean.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.467
It will have a negative
delta value.

00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:39.767
And then as you condense water
out, the rain is going to be

00:13:39.767 --> 00:13:42.233
heavier than the vapor.

00:13:42.233 --> 00:13:45.167
So if the vapor is minus 10,
the rain is going to be

00:13:45.167 --> 00:13:46.067
heavier than that.

00:13:46.067 --> 00:13:49.033
Let's say minus 3.

00:13:49.033 --> 00:13:51.967
The remaining vapor after you've
removed some of the

00:13:51.967 --> 00:13:57.200
liquid is going to be lighter
still, because you've removed

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.900
some of the heavier isotopes.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.367
Then if you rain again from
that lighter vapor, the

00:14:03.367 --> 00:14:08.800
precipitation is going to be
heavier than that vapor but

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.900
lighter than the rain that
fell out before.

00:14:17.467 --> 00:14:20.467
And the vapor remaining is
going to be even lighter,

00:14:20.467 --> 00:14:25.100
because you've removed heavier
isotopes of the vapor that you

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.300
started with.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.400
So this is the progressive
fractionation process.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.800
This is a little bit tricky.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.967
So if there's questions here,
let me go back over this.

00:14:42.233 --> 00:14:42.600
Yeah.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.833
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:47.033 --> 00:14:47.633
PROFESSOR:
I'm sorry?

00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:50.700
STUDENT: What does the negative
hydrogen mean?

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.433
PROFESSOR: So that's
the delta value.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.900
That would be--iff that's delta
O-18 and I think those

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.100
values would be appropriate that
would be the value here.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.267
And if it's negative, it means
that that number was less than

00:15:06.267 --> 00:15:07.367
that number.

00:15:07.367 --> 00:15:11.567
So that ratio was less than one
so that when I subtracted

00:15:11.567 --> 00:15:14.867
one from it, I got a
negative number.

00:15:14.867 --> 00:15:19.633
So what it's telling me is that
that sample is lighter

00:15:19.633 --> 00:15:23.467
than my ocean reference,
my SMOW reference.

00:15:23.467 --> 00:15:30.333
So all the numbers in this
cartoon are delta values, and

00:15:30.333 --> 00:15:34.567
they're indicated that by that
little per mill sign there,

00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:37.200
that per thousand sign there.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.433
That means not per
hundred like a

00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:40.700
percent, but per thousand.

00:15:44.867 --> 00:15:45.800
Question.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.733
STUDENT: So it's compared to
SMOW water sample that came

00:15:49.733 --> 00:15:50.833
from the ocean?

00:15:50.833 --> 00:15:52.033
PROFESSOR:
That's right.

00:15:52.033 --> 00:15:55.800
That's why this first value is
zero, because it's being

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.600
compared with ocean.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.167
And so that delta value turns
out to be zero if it is ocean

00:16:01.167 --> 00:16:02.800
water you are sampling.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.500
STUDENT: So what's the
difference between the rain

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.433
and the precipitation?

00:16:05.433 --> 00:16:08.700
Why is one lighter
than the other?

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.800
PROFESSOR: Well, the
rain--this is the rain.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.433
I hope I didn't misspeak.

00:16:14.433 --> 00:16:18.367
Rain and precipitation I'm
using synonymously.

00:16:18.367 --> 00:16:20.867
But I'm drawing a stark
contrast between the

00:16:20.867 --> 00:16:23.600
vapor and the rain.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.200
So here the vapor you're
starting with is

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.767
minus 10 per mill.

00:16:28.767 --> 00:16:32.333
The rain that comes out of that,
while it's lighter than

00:16:32.333 --> 00:16:36.500
ocean, it's heavier than the
vapor from which it's formed.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.033
So it has a negative number, but
not as negative as that,

00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:42.700
making the vapor still lighter,
making the next

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.400
precipitation still lighter.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.933
And the vapor is even lighter
than that vapor.

00:16:47.933 --> 00:16:51.800
So the things progress along
together, gradually raining

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:57.500
out the heavier isotopes.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.000
Yes.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.700
STUDENT: Why are
evapotranspiration and the

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.933
vapor--the second
vapor--different numbers?

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.567
PROFESSOR: I'd rather
not talk about this

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:08.967
one, because it involves a
complicated process of what

00:17:08.967 --> 00:17:13.100
water has fallen to Earth and
what is being re-evaporated.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.467
So let me just ignore that.

00:17:14.467 --> 00:17:17.300
This is a correct value on
average, but I'd rather not

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.167
get into that, because it
complicates the picture.

00:17:20.167 --> 00:17:24.767
We're just going to deal with
primarily these issues here.

00:17:24.767 --> 00:17:25.233
Yes.

00:17:25.233 --> 00:17:29.733
STUDENT: Does the percentage
of the vapor as it gets

00:17:29.733 --> 00:17:34.133
increasingly smaller, or more
negative, how does that affect

00:17:34.133 --> 00:17:35.633
the weather?

00:17:35.633 --> 00:17:38.433
PROFESSOR:
Not at all.

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:43.000
This is a climate diagnostic
subject.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.600
It has nothing to do it all with
how the atmosphere works.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.833
That's the thing about
these isotopes.

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:54.067
They're behaving chemically like
ordinary elements, and

00:17:54.067 --> 00:17:57.900
this slight shift in the vapor
pressure is so small that it

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.967
doesn't have any
known influence

00:17:59.967 --> 00:18:01.967
on the weather patterns.

00:18:01.967 --> 00:18:04.800
So we're just using this as a
tool to understand what nature

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.800
is doing, not as something
that will change nature.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:14.300
So when you take a--when you go
to Antarctica or Greenland

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:22.433
and dig down and pull out an
ice core, you're going to

00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:24.733
get--you're going to look at
things as a function of depth.

00:18:24.733 --> 00:18:26.167
I'll show you some pictures
in just a minute.

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:30.167
But from that ice core, you're
going to shave off ice from

00:18:30.167 --> 00:18:34.433
different depths and determine
the delta D and the delta O-18

00:18:34.433 --> 00:18:39.000
values as a function of depth.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.300
Generally, the isotopes
in the ice cores are

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.133
lighter than the ocean.

00:18:43.133 --> 00:18:49.900
We saw that, because for
example, the precipitation

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.400
falling on this mountaintop
is lighter than the ocean.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.367
It goes back to this initial
evaporation.

00:18:56.367 --> 00:18:59.400
The vapor became so much lighter
as it evaporated that

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.933
that lightness still remains,
is even amplified by

00:19:03.933 --> 00:19:08.233
precipitation that's occurred
between the ocean and the

00:19:08.233 --> 00:19:10.533
location where you're
getting your sample.

00:19:10.533 --> 00:19:14.333
So the isotopes in the ice core
will be lighter than the

00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:16.633
ocean, but they're not
going to be constant.

00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:19.533
They're going to vary
with climate.

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:21.967
And in the literature, there are
two ideas that have been

00:19:21.967 --> 00:19:25.300
put forward to understand
why those isotopes

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.633
would vary with climate.

00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:30.200
One is that under a different
climate situation, the source

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.733
of the water vapor
might change.

00:19:34.733 --> 00:19:37.867
Something back here
might change.

00:19:37.867 --> 00:19:40.967
And the other is that the
fractionation that takes place

00:19:40.967 --> 00:19:44.567
in the atmosphere between the
ocean and your sampling

00:19:44.567 --> 00:19:47.867
location might change.

00:19:47.867 --> 00:19:48.833
So I put that here.

00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:53.400
Source changes or changes in
that progressive fractionation

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.733
in the atmosphere.

00:19:54.733 --> 00:19:58.633
It's believed now by almost
every author that this is the

00:19:58.633 --> 00:20:00.367
dominant one.

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:02.000
So I'm going to focus on this.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.833
So in the next bullet, I said
it's mostly sensitive to local

00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:07.533
air temperature, as that
measures the degree of

00:20:07.533 --> 00:20:11.600
fractionation, which means that
you get a light isotope

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.700
signature during ice age.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.067
I've tried to illustrate
that here.

00:20:16.067 --> 00:20:18.967
So you have some water
vapor source.

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:22.067
We're going to presume for the
moment this is constant,

00:20:22.067 --> 00:20:25.533
giving you the same
isotope ratios in

00:20:25.533 --> 00:20:28.100
the evaporating vapor.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:32.200
Then as this air parcel moves
along and encounters different

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.467
clouds and different storm
events, you're going to

00:20:34.467 --> 00:20:37.733
gradually precipitate
out that water.

00:20:37.733 --> 00:20:43.400
Every time you do so, you're
going to be precipitating the

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.200
heavier vapor, leaving
the lighter behind.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.833
So the next precipitation is
going to be lighter than the

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:53.233
first and still lighter
and still lighter.

00:20:53.233 --> 00:20:56.867
And so the isotope ratio in this
final falling snow that's

00:20:56.867 --> 00:21:00.600
going to fall on your ice sheet
is going to depend on

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:06.667
how much you've cooled the air
between the source and the

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:10.633
sample area, because the more
you've cooled it, the more

00:21:10.633 --> 00:21:12.567
water vapor you have removed.

00:21:12.567 --> 00:21:15.600
Remember, when you drop the
temperature, you decrease the

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.833
amount of vapor that
can be held.

00:21:18.833 --> 00:21:21.533
And therefore, if you cool the
air a lot, you've had to

00:21:21.533 --> 00:21:24.667
remove more and more
of the water vapor.

00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:28.433
And when you do that, you get an
isotope which gets lighter

00:21:28.433 --> 00:21:33.467
and lighter in proportion to how
much you've cooled the air

00:21:33.467 --> 00:21:36.233
going from source to
record location.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.400
All right.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.200
So we're going to look at
some Greenland cores.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.200
There have been a number
of them done.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.133
Camp Century, a couple
of GRIPs, GISPs,

00:21:48.133 --> 00:21:52.767
GISP 2, and Dye 3.

00:21:52.767 --> 00:21:55.200
Here's a snowfall map
of Greenland.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.967
Most of the accumulation is down
here in the southeast,

00:21:57.967 --> 00:22:01.067
but you get some accumulation
everywhere.

00:22:01.067 --> 00:22:11.667
And what we're going to do is
to put a drilling rig up on

00:22:11.667 --> 00:22:14.667
the ice cap, up on the ice
sheet and drill down.

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:18.267
Here's a scientist marking
an ice core.

00:22:18.267 --> 00:22:20.933
And ice core is about
that big around.

00:22:20.933 --> 00:22:25.167
And it can be many hundreds
of meters, even a

00:22:25.167 --> 00:22:26.400
kilometer or so deep.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.467
And of course, they pull
it out in sections.

00:22:28.467 --> 00:22:32.333
They pull out a section break
it, lay it down, put it in a

00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:36.100
storage shed, then drill out
another ice core and so on.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.900
So they end up with these things
stored in sections, and

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.733
then they can do analysis
as a function of depth.

00:22:42.733 --> 00:22:45.300
And if they have some kind of
a dating tool, they can

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:50.167
determine what age that ice is
at, of course older and older

00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:55.367
as you go deeper down
into the ice core.

00:22:55.367 --> 00:22:58.900
We've done this on Antarctica
as well.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.633
All these dots are places
where there

00:23:01.633 --> 00:23:02.833
have been ice cores.

00:23:02.833 --> 00:23:05.033
We're going to be talking about
the Vostok Core, which

00:23:05.033 --> 00:23:06.667
is one of the deepest cores.

00:23:06.667 --> 00:23:12.167
This one was done by the
Russians some years ago.

00:23:12.167 --> 00:23:18.133
So here's a record then
with years before

00:23:18.133 --> 00:23:21.733
present on the x-axis.

00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:28.333
And in the upper panel are
cores from Antarctica.

00:23:28.333 --> 00:23:32.000
And they are represented
as delta D values.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.667
Here they've written
it as delta 2H.

00:23:34.667 --> 00:23:38.767
Remember 2H is what we're
calling deuterium.

00:23:38.767 --> 00:23:42.600
So this is the same as
our delta D value.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:48.167
And then down in the lower panel
is the delta O-18 for a

00:23:48.167 --> 00:23:53.733
Greenland ice core in fact two
of them, NGRIP and GRIP.

00:23:53.733 --> 00:23:56.500
And you can use either
isotope.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.000
It doesn't really matter which
pair you're using.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.900
You get a similar signal
for climate change.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.667
There isn't a great deal of
difference between using delta

00:24:04.667 --> 00:24:08.100
D and delta O-18 for
these purposes.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.367
But the numbers are different.

00:24:09.367 --> 00:24:14.533
For example, for delta D, the
delta values are much larger.

00:24:14.533 --> 00:24:19.533
They're minus 460, 440, 420,
whereas for oxygen, which

00:24:19.533 --> 00:24:23.533
fractionates less strongly,
you get somewhat smaller.

00:24:23.533 --> 00:24:26.733
Notice that they're all negative
though, which means

00:24:26.733 --> 00:24:29.900
that all these ice samples
are isotopically

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.333
lighter than the ocean.

00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:34.933
We expected that for
two reasons.

00:24:34.933 --> 00:24:38.433
One is the water that evaporated
from the ocean was

00:24:38.433 --> 00:24:41.267
lighter than the ocean water
itself because of

00:24:41.267 --> 00:24:42.933
fractionation.

00:24:42.933 --> 00:24:46.300
And then this path fractionation
as the water

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.533
moved from source to Antarctica
or source to

00:24:50.533 --> 00:24:54.933
Greenland, you've made it even
lighter by raining out a

00:24:54.933 --> 00:24:57.800
fraction of the water
on the way to this

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.467
final record location.

00:25:01.467 --> 00:25:04.033
Well, this gives us a rather
nice time record.

00:25:06.733 --> 00:25:08.100
This is the modern era.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:14.967
This is today, if you like and
it looks like we have somewhat

00:25:14.967 --> 00:25:23.133
heavier isotopes than normal
during the last 12,000,

00:25:23.133 --> 00:25:25.867
15,000, 20,000 years ago.

00:25:25.867 --> 00:25:29.800
And of course, this is the
Holocene Period, the last

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.567
interglacial.

00:25:31.567 --> 00:25:37.967
Prior to that, the isotope
ratios were more negative,

00:25:37.967 --> 00:25:39.433
which means lighter.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.067
And we would interpret
that--according to the

00:25:43.067 --> 00:25:46.733
dominant literature on this--we
would interpret that

00:25:46.733 --> 00:25:53.367
as having more water removed
between source and sample

00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:55.800
location, which means
a lower temperature

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.133
at the sample location.

00:25:59.133 --> 00:26:03.933
So the conventional wisdom is
to interpret this as giving

00:26:03.933 --> 00:26:09.367
you a temperature record near
the place where the record is

00:26:09.367 --> 00:26:11.300
kept, near the ice sheet.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.967
So colder.

00:26:14.967 --> 00:26:18.667
Staying cold for about
100,000 years.

00:26:18.667 --> 00:26:22.733
Then a brief interglacial, and
then back into another long

00:26:22.733 --> 00:26:26.933
ice age with cold conditions
at least at the location of

00:26:26.933 --> 00:26:28.033
the ice sheet.

00:26:28.033 --> 00:26:30.667
May be cold other places as
well, but what we're measuring

00:26:30.667 --> 00:26:34.833
here, we think, is the
temperature of the air over

00:26:34.833 --> 00:26:39.567
the ice sheet where those
snowflakes are being formed.

00:26:39.567 --> 00:26:40.500
This is Antarctica.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.600
And notice that both cores done
independently show a very

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.867
similar record.

00:26:48.233 --> 00:26:50.933
Even more surprising is that
when you go to the northern

00:26:50.933 --> 00:26:54.367
hemisphere in Greenland, you get
a record that, again, is

00:26:54.367 --> 00:26:58.200
fairly similar with
interglacials, glacial

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.367
periods, the Holocene.

00:27:01.367 --> 00:27:04.833
So this seems, although it's a
local measurement, it seems to

00:27:04.833 --> 00:27:09.000
be global in character.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.333
And this is a characteristic
then of global climate, even

00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:17.133
though it's a local temperature
record.

00:27:17.133 --> 00:27:19.967
Questions on this?

00:27:19.967 --> 00:27:22.633
I still find this astounding
that these different ice cores

00:27:22.633 --> 00:27:24.900
from different hemispheres give
such similar records.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.833
Yeah, Jordan

00:27:25.833 --> 00:27:28.500
STUDENT: Can you explain again
why the lighter isotopes means

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.733
colder temperatures?

00:27:31.933 --> 00:27:36.367
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
because in this model, let's

00:27:36.367 --> 00:27:38.667
say this is at a fixed
temperature here.

00:27:38.667 --> 00:27:43.400
And so if you just cool the
air a little bit between

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:48.300
source and ice sheet, you would
remove maybe half the

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.867
water vapor and fractionate
it accordingly.

00:27:52.867 --> 00:27:56.400
But if this were much colder,
you would remove a much larger

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.167
fraction, maybe three quarters
of the water vapor, that would

00:28:00.167 --> 00:28:03.567
fractionate more strongly, and
you'd get lighter isotopes

00:28:03.567 --> 00:28:05.067
falling on the ice sheet.

00:28:05.067 --> 00:28:07.900
So temperature, remember,
controls how much water vapor

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.567
you have in the atmosphere.

00:28:09.567 --> 00:28:11.767
So the more cooling you
get, the more water

00:28:11.767 --> 00:28:13.467
vapor has to be removed.

00:28:13.467 --> 00:28:16.767
The more water vapor you remove,
the more fractionation

00:28:16.767 --> 00:28:18.267
there's been in the
isotope ratio.

00:28:21.267 --> 00:28:22.833
OK.

00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:28.567
So it's remarkable that these
two local records of

00:28:28.567 --> 00:28:30.333
fractionation and temperature
are so similar.

00:28:30.333 --> 00:28:32.733
They provide an accurate time
record of the ice ages.

00:28:32.733 --> 00:28:35.567
One more thing that's even more
astounding, you can take

00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:41.400
those same ice cores and find
tiny bubbles in them.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.300
As the snow fell and more snow
fell on top, and you finally

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.600
compacted it into ice, there are
little bubbles that trap

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.767
samples of the ancient
atmosphere.

00:28:52.767 --> 00:28:55.500
You can stick a probe into those
ice bubbles and do a

00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:00.133
carbon dioxide concentration
analysis to find out what the

00:29:00.133 --> 00:29:03.000
carbon dioxide concentration
was in those ancient

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.233
atmospheres.

00:29:04.233 --> 00:29:09.133
So here I've plotted up from
the Vostok Core alone, a

00:29:09.133 --> 00:29:12.267
record that goes the time
axis is switched here.

00:29:12.267 --> 00:29:15.900
This is today, and this
is going back in time.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.200
This goes back a bit further.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.533
I've shown you data back
to 400,000 years ago.

00:29:21.533 --> 00:29:24.133
Here's the isotope record
converted to a temperature.

00:29:26.833 --> 00:29:30.300
Isotope record converted to
an equivalent temperature.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.833
And then in the top panel
is the carbon dioxide

00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:36.600
concentration taken from
the same location

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.800
along the ice core.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.067
Here's the modern day.

00:29:42.067 --> 00:29:45.500
At the top of the ice core, you
had about 280 parts per

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.533
million by volume, which is
about the value we think is

00:29:49.533 --> 00:29:53.300
the pre-industrial carbon
dioxide value for the Earth's

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.767
atmosphere.

00:29:55.767 --> 00:29:58.900
Then back in the end of the last
ice age, the last glacial

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.000
maximum is here.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.833
You had much lower carbon
dioxide concentrations, even

00:30:03.833 --> 00:30:06.400
below 200 parts per thousand.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.933
It stayed low, and others have
mirrored the temperatures

00:30:08.933 --> 00:30:11.433
quite remarkably.

00:30:11.433 --> 00:30:14.067
Carbon dioxide concentration
and

00:30:14.067 --> 00:30:17.467
temperature are very similar.

00:30:17.467 --> 00:30:20.300
They have a very similar record,
at least over this

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.033
period we call the Pleistocene,
with the ice ages

00:30:23.033 --> 00:30:27.700
coming and going and
coming and going.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.667
We'll talk a lot about this
coming up in the global

00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:35.900
warming, but at a very minimum,
this reinforces our

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.467
idea of the importance
of CO2 and climate.

00:30:39.467 --> 00:30:42.700
When you had high CO2, you
had warmer climates.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.333
When you had low CO2, you had
colder climates, perfectly

00:30:46.333 --> 00:30:50.867
fitting with our idea of the
greenhouse effect and CO2

00:30:50.867 --> 00:30:52.433
being a greenhouse gas.

00:30:54.967 --> 00:30:57.767
Now there's also some argument
though about cause and effect,

00:30:57.767 --> 00:30:59.967
which comes first, which
leads and lags.

00:30:59.967 --> 00:31:01.900
We'll get into that a little
bit next week.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.967
But for the time being, I would
take this at face value

00:31:04.967 --> 00:31:07.900
and just say that it reinforces
the connection

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.767
between CO2 in the atmosphere
and global temperature.

00:31:14.667 --> 00:31:19.133
Now I want to talk about other
kinds of sediments.

00:31:21.933 --> 00:31:27.233
On land, you can walk around
and see rocks like this.

00:31:27.233 --> 00:31:30.000
I'm sure you have. Rocks
that seem to

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.300
have a layered structure.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:36.800
Most of the time, when you see
such rock patterns, you're

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.400
looking at some kind
of evidence of

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.867
ancient climate change.

00:31:40.867 --> 00:31:44.600
One kind of climate allowed
sediments in a lake

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.100
to look like this.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.100
A change in climate changed
it to that.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.167
A change back gave sediments
like this.

00:31:52.167 --> 00:31:54.933
This is easy to speculate about,
because you see lots of

00:31:54.933 --> 00:31:57.133
sedimentary layered
rocks like that.

00:31:57.133 --> 00:32:00.700
It's not so easy to figure out
what exactly this means in

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.467
terms of climate.

00:32:02.467 --> 00:32:06.667
But it's a start to be able to
see such stratification on

00:32:06.667 --> 00:32:10.967
land and just imagine in a
vague way, this may be

00:32:10.967 --> 00:32:16.167
evidence of changing climates
in the ancient world.

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:19.367
How many have been to
the Grand Canyon?

00:32:19.367 --> 00:32:21.567
You see something like this.

00:32:21.567 --> 00:32:25.200
And lots of layered rocks.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.267
And what you should be thinking
of when you see rocks

00:32:28.267 --> 00:32:30.633
like this is ancient
climate change.

00:32:30.633 --> 00:32:34.200
These changes probably are
telling us something about

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.700
changes in the ancient
climate of the Earth.

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.867
But again, they're rather
difficult to sort out, because

00:32:38.867 --> 00:32:44.600
we don't always know the
environment in which those

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.233
sediments were laid down.

00:32:47.233 --> 00:32:49.367
So we're going to do something
similar to this but in the

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:54.033
ocean, where the ocean sediments
have had a rather

00:32:54.033 --> 00:32:58.467
constant sedimentation rate.

00:32:58.467 --> 00:33:00.733
And therefore, we can do
a little easier job of

00:33:00.733 --> 00:33:03.433
interpreting if we can
get a sample of that.

00:33:03.433 --> 00:33:06.900
So the way we do that is to
do deep ocean drilling.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.433
You take a ship that has
a drilling rig on it.

00:33:10.433 --> 00:33:15.767
And you lower that drill bit
down to the ocean floor and

00:33:15.767 --> 00:33:18.333
then start pushing into
the soft sediments.

00:33:18.333 --> 00:33:20.867
And then after a while as you
go deeper and deeper, you're

00:33:20.867 --> 00:33:23.733
drilling into rather solid
rock, but it's all

00:33:23.733 --> 00:33:28.300
representing deep
ocean sediments.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.833
And they look like this.

00:33:29.833 --> 00:33:32.333
They're about the same size.

00:33:32.333 --> 00:33:34.300
But they're made of rock.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.467
And here's an archive of
hundreds and thousands of such

00:33:38.467 --> 00:33:41.400
deep sea cores that have been
drilled out and stored.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.100
So we have a lot of
these samples.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.767
We can do a lot of
work with them.

00:33:44.767 --> 00:33:49.700
And primarily these deep sea
sediments are comprised of

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.100
calcium carbonate.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.367
They've got other things in
them, but calcium carbonate,

00:33:54.367 --> 00:34:02.600
CaCO3, it has oxygen in it.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.800
Besides calcium and carbon,
it has oxygen in it.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:11.233
And they're mostly the remains
of shells produced by

00:34:11.233 --> 00:34:18.033
microorganisms, phytoplankton
mostly, in the ocean.

00:34:18.033 --> 00:34:23.400
And when the organism makes its
shell, it gets its oxygen

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.400
from the oxygen in water.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.633
So there stored in this calcium
carbonate is a record

00:34:31.633 --> 00:34:36.500
of the isotope ratio
of oxygen--

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.700
O-18 to O-16 in ocean water,
because the organism got its

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.033
oxygen from seawater in order
to make that shell.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:56.600
I'm going to show you a deep sea
sediment core, RC13-259,

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.733
the one right there.

00:34:57.733 --> 00:35:04.767
Here is Antarctica, Cape Horn,
Cape of Good Hope, Australia,

00:35:04.767 --> 00:35:06.100
New Zealand.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:10.267
And the deep sea sediment core
in the ocean is here.

00:35:10.267 --> 00:35:13.333
And we're going to compare that
with the Vostok Ice Core,

00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:14.567
which is there.

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:23.467
So what we've done is take
samples of the oxygen from the

00:35:23.467 --> 00:35:24.733
calcium carbonate.

00:35:27.533 --> 00:35:30.800
We expect that sample of oxygen
is going to be slightly

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.000
heavier isotopically than the
ocean water, because when the

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.767
organism makes its shell,
it slightly

00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:39.900
prefers the heavier isotope.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:44.500
In addition to that, though,
we expect it to change with

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:48.733
climate either because the
temperature effect on how the

00:35:48.733 --> 00:35:54.233
organism makes its shell might
be coming through, or the

00:35:54.233 --> 00:35:58.200
isotope ratio in the water
itself might be

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.167
dominating the signal.

00:36:00.167 --> 00:36:03.033
The first papers on this
thought it was this.

00:36:03.033 --> 00:36:06.067
Now there's an almost universal
agreement in the

00:36:06.067 --> 00:36:09.600
scientific literature that when
you get oxygen 18 data

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.467
from ice cores, you're mostly
getting a measure of the

00:36:14.467 --> 00:36:18.000
oxygen in the ocean water, and
that's telling you something

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.367
about the glacial ice mass, how
much water has been stored

00:36:21.367 --> 00:36:24.567
up on land in the glaciers.

00:36:24.567 --> 00:36:30.467
So most of the literature now is
purporting this idea, that

00:36:30.467 --> 00:36:32.967
it's most sensitive to
continental ice mass.

00:36:32.967 --> 00:36:35.700
That means it's going to be
heavy during an ice age.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.000
Let me explain that
with a cartoon.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.400
In a period like today, an
interglacial period, the

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.600
oceans are full of water.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:53.700
This is our reference state
today by the way for O-18.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:59.733
During a glacial period, you
have lowered sea level by

00:36:59.733 --> 00:37:04.333
evaporating water from the ocean
and not returning it.

00:37:04.333 --> 00:37:07.500
Remember the Quinnipiac
field trip, right?

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.600
You're evaporating water
from the ocean.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.267
You're raining it out over land,
and it's running right

00:37:12.267 --> 00:37:16.233
back into the oceans
in rivers.

00:37:16.233 --> 00:37:17.233
No net change.

00:37:17.233 --> 00:37:20.667
The hydrologic cycle is just
running in steady state.

00:37:20.667 --> 00:37:24.100
The oceans are staying at the
same level and so on.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.733
However, during a glacial
period, you've evaporated some

00:37:26.733 --> 00:37:28.900
of that water and
not returned it.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.700
You stored it as a large sheet
on the continents.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:38.500
We know that that water is
lighter isotopically than the

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.500
ocean, so you stored light water
on the continents, which

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.467
means that the oceans are now
isotopically heavier than they

00:37:46.467 --> 00:37:47.900
were before.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.233
And that's the signal we hope
to see in the deep sea

00:37:51.233 --> 00:37:52.467
sediment cores.

00:37:55.033 --> 00:37:56.267
So here's the comparison.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:05.733
Vostok delta D is plotted in the
upper panel, and the scale

00:38:05.733 --> 00:38:07.767
is on the left.

00:38:07.767 --> 00:38:12.567
This deep sea sediment core,
which is represented as delta

00:38:12.567 --> 00:38:15.133
O-18, is plotted on the right.

00:38:15.133 --> 00:38:19.133
And it's the lower panel.

00:38:19.133 --> 00:38:21.533
And the time scales
are matched up.

00:38:21.533 --> 00:38:25.467
So we can go back 400,000 years
into the past for both

00:38:25.467 --> 00:38:26.500
of these records.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.067
And notice how they line up.

00:38:28.067 --> 00:38:29.400
But the signals are opposite.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:35.133
So during an ice age, the delta
D is more negative,

00:38:35.133 --> 00:38:40.000
whereas the deep sea sediment
core is more positive, because

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000
you've stored light water on
land, made the oceans heavier,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.300
and that signal is
coming through.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.500
So you see, this is perhaps even
more remarkable, because

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.433
we have two very different kinds
of records, a deep sea

00:38:56.433 --> 00:39:03.533
sediment core and an ice core,
whose isotopic signals are

00:39:03.533 --> 00:39:09.467
driven by somewhat different
physics, and yet they both

00:39:09.467 --> 00:39:14.233
give us a corresponding similar
record of the advance

00:39:14.233 --> 00:39:16.700
and retreat of these ice ages.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.333
It's a rather remarkable
result.

00:39:19.333 --> 00:39:22.533
That's why these isotopes are
so valuable in giving us a

00:39:22.533 --> 00:39:28.333
quantitative understanding of
the Pleistocene Period.

00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:29.600
Any questions on that?

00:39:31.967 --> 00:39:34.400
So you'll have to think about
this, because I know it's a

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.900
complicated subject, but
these notes are posted.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:43.167
So part of the story then and
this is not a surprise if you

00:39:43.167 --> 00:39:45.500
put all that ice up
on land, you will

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.067
have lowered sea level.

00:39:48.067 --> 00:39:52.033
And so here is a record from
physical measurements, going

00:39:52.033 --> 00:39:55.167
around various places,
understanding from the nature

00:39:55.167 --> 00:39:59.500
of the shoreline where sea level
was at various times in

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.767
the past. This is thousands
of years ago.

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:06.200
And at the last glacial maximum,
which is here, sea

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:11.867
level was about 120 meters
below where it is today.

00:40:11.867 --> 00:40:14.633
And you find that same thing no
matter where you measure.

00:40:14.633 --> 00:40:17.233
Remember, sea level
tends to be level.

00:40:17.233 --> 00:40:18.667
It's in the very name.

00:40:18.667 --> 00:40:21.267
And so when you drop sea level,
you drop it the same

00:40:21.267 --> 00:40:23.167
everywhere in the ocean.

00:40:23.167 --> 00:40:25.500
And therefore you should get
the same record no matter

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.033
where you do that analysis.

00:40:28.033 --> 00:40:31.967
And then as we came out of the
last ice age, we came up to

00:40:31.967 --> 00:40:36.933
the present sea level rise.

00:40:36.933 --> 00:40:39.400
So this is from physical
measurement, not from isotope

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.900
measurements, but it agrees
conceptually with that deep

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:48.600
sea sediment core analysis,
which I argued is a measure of

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:55.567
how much water is stored on the
land in large ice sheets,

00:40:55.567 --> 00:40:57.933
especially the Laurentide
ice sheet and the

00:40:57.933 --> 00:41:02.667
Fennoscandian ice sheet.

00:41:02.667 --> 00:41:08.100
So if you made a map of the
Earth during the last glacial

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:13.667
maximum, land would be
somewhat larger.

00:41:13.667 --> 00:41:16.867
Of course we know this is mostly
continental shelf.

00:41:16.867 --> 00:41:19.933
You don't have to lower the
ocean very much in order to

00:41:19.933 --> 00:41:22.533
expand it out a bit--expand the
continents out, because

00:41:22.533 --> 00:41:26.700
there's some shallow submerged
land today.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:30.000
But that's typically where the
coastline would have been

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.267
15,000 to 20,000 years ago.

00:41:33.267 --> 00:41:38.167
And the point I want to make
here is that the gap between

00:41:38.167 --> 00:41:43.200
Asia and North America was
actually bridged at that time

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.700
because of a lowered
sea level.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:50.633
It's believed then that this
was the moment when humans

00:41:50.633 --> 00:41:55.233
could first migrate
to North America.

00:41:55.233 --> 00:41:59.567
And so this business of sea
level change and ice ages then

00:41:59.567 --> 00:42:04.967
directly carries over to the
anthropology of the Americas.

00:42:04.967 --> 00:42:09.200
When did people first come to
this continent, and how did

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.233
they get there?

00:42:10.233 --> 00:42:12.600
And there are other theories.

00:42:15.433 --> 00:42:17.033
They may have sailed
from Asia.

00:42:17.033 --> 00:42:20.567
They may have sailed from the
islands in the Pacific.

00:42:20.567 --> 00:42:24.700
But this, I believe, is still
the leading theory for how

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:28.600
humans, which evolved in Africa
and Asia, finally made

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.900
it to the New World.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:34.933
And they did that about 20,000
years ago following the Bering

00:42:34.933 --> 00:42:37.600
Sea Land Bridge.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.667
The way anthropologists, or
archaeologists describe the

00:42:41.667 --> 00:42:45.767
different cultures in the
Americas is by the type of

00:42:45.767 --> 00:42:48.400
arrowheads that they made.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:58.167
So the Clovis culture sorry
about that would have made the

00:42:58.167 --> 00:42:59.900
Clovis points.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:05.500
They can track this back to
about 11,500 years, but before

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:10.267
that, there's not too much
record of humans, which means

00:43:10.267 --> 00:43:12.733
probably that's about
when they came.

00:43:12.733 --> 00:43:16.967
So roughly during the period of
the last glacial maximum is

00:43:16.967 --> 00:43:22.400
probably when these cultures
moved to the New World.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.367
And all the Indian cultures we
see today then in the desert

00:43:26.367 --> 00:43:31.600
southwest or up in the northwest
US and Canada, those

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.200
cultures probably came
over about that time.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.733
There is a national park up on
the northwest coast of Alaska.

00:43:38.733 --> 00:43:40.267
I want to go there someday.

00:43:40.267 --> 00:43:43.833
It's called the Land
Bridge Preserve.

00:43:43.833 --> 00:43:51.333
And on their website, they show
human footprints, which

00:43:51.333 --> 00:43:55.400
supposedly are a record of those
people walking It must

00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:00.500
have been cold though, but I
guess they had built up a

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:04.900
resistance to the cold over
from Asia to North America

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.467
during that period of time.

00:44:08.467 --> 00:44:10.567
I only have a couple minutes
to talk about

00:44:10.567 --> 00:44:12.067
Milankovitch theory.

00:44:12.067 --> 00:44:14.233
Your book does a pretty good
job of it, but I do want to

00:44:14.233 --> 00:44:16.767
spend a couple minutes on it.

00:44:16.767 --> 00:44:20.500
What has caused this periodic
coming and going of the ice

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.567
sheets during the Pleistocene?

00:44:23.567 --> 00:44:25.967
It's not a solved problem.

00:44:25.967 --> 00:44:31.200
I don't want to present this
to you as known fact, but

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:35.100
there is considerable evidence
that slow changes in the

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.067
Earth's orbit induced by Jupiter
and other planets

00:44:39.067 --> 00:44:44.533
probably were what caused or at
least in some way paced the

00:44:44.533 --> 00:44:48.600
coming and going of the ice ages
during the Pleistocene.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.333
And the three changes in the
orbital parameters that are

00:44:51.333 --> 00:44:56.167
discussed--that are understood
in this regard are the

00:44:56.167 --> 00:45:02.867
precession that is a slow
rotation of the orientation of

00:45:02.867 --> 00:45:04.100
the Earth's tilt.

00:45:06.867 --> 00:45:11.033
Second is the obliquity, which
is the magnitude of the

00:45:11.033 --> 00:45:13.667
Earth's tilt.

00:45:13.667 --> 00:45:16.000
And the third is the
eccentricity

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.333
of the Earth's orbit.

00:45:18.333 --> 00:45:20.267
You know that the Earth's orbit
around the sun is not

00:45:20.267 --> 00:45:22.367
exactly circular.

00:45:22.367 --> 00:45:24.500
It has a little bit of
eccentricity to it.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.767
And the amount of that
eccentricity has been changing

00:45:27.767 --> 00:45:29.167
slowly with time.

00:45:29.167 --> 00:45:32.867
The precession goes through a
full cycle all the way around

00:45:32.867 --> 00:45:36.533
and back in about
20,000 years.

00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:41.933
The obliquity, this little
changing of the tilt, goes

00:45:41.933 --> 00:45:43.333
through a full cycle
approximately

00:45:43.333 --> 00:45:45.267
every 40,000 years.

00:45:45.267 --> 00:45:49.267
And the eccentricity, the
changing of the ellipticity of

00:45:49.267 --> 00:45:51.667
this orbit, goes through
a cycle of about

00:45:51.667 --> 00:45:54.900
every 100,000 years.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.600
This is the smallest effect.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.433
And recent papers suggest
that this may not be

00:46:00.433 --> 00:46:02.800
playing much of a role.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.333
Most of the attention the last
few years has been on these

00:46:05.333 --> 00:46:11.000
two cycles for causing these
advances and retreats.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.067
What these things mostly do, if
you think about it, is that

00:46:15.067 --> 00:46:18.533
they change the way
seasonality works.

00:46:18.533 --> 00:46:22.267
Remember, the obliquity, the
tilt of the Earth's axis,

00:46:22.267 --> 00:46:25.833
controls seasonality on Earth.

00:46:25.833 --> 00:46:29.000
And the precession, the way that
this orientation of the

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.233
tilt lines up with the long axis
of the orbit, controls

00:46:34.233 --> 00:46:37.267
the strength of the seasons also
because of the way the

00:46:37.267 --> 00:46:41.100
tilt and the perihelion
combine.

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.867
So these two things are mostly
changing the seasonality, but

00:46:44.867 --> 00:46:49.567
apparently that is enough
to push us into and

00:46:49.567 --> 00:46:52.833
out of an ice age.

00:46:52.833 --> 00:46:56.900
This diagram shows the same
thing in different order, the

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:01.567
eccentricity, the obliquity,
and the precession.

00:47:01.567 --> 00:47:04.067
And I think that's all I have
to talk about today.

00:47:04.067 --> 00:47:04.600
Yeah.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.100
So we got just through
this at the end.

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.933
I think you have enough to
finish up that problem set.

00:47:09.933 --> 00:47:14.367
And on Friday we'll begin
to work on the

00:47:14.367 --> 00:47:17.767
subject of global warming.

00:47:17.767 --> 00:47:19.567
Read chapter 13.

00:47:19.567 --> 00:47:21.567
Chapter 13 is your key in
the book.

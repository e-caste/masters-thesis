00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.558
Prof: So,
I've got to start by telling

00:00:05.558 --> 00:00:09.113
you the syllabus for this
term--not the detailed one,

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:10.960
just the big game plan.
 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.772
The game plan is:
we will do electromagnetic

00:00:14.772 --> 00:00:15.570
theory.
 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.336
Electromagnetism is a new force
that I will introduce to you and

00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:21.070
go through all the details.
 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.863
And I will do optics,
and optics is part of

00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:26.580
electromagnetism.
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.740
And then near the end we will
do quantum mechanics.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.710
Now, quantum mechanics is not
like a new force.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.490
It's a whole different ball
game.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.637
It's not about what forces are
acting on this or that object

00:00:40.637 --> 00:00:43.450
that make it move,
or change its path.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.316
The question there is:
should we be even thinking

00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:47.570
about trajectories?
 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.552
Should we be even thinking
about particles going on any

00:00:49.552 --> 00:00:50.030
trajectory?
 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.010
Forget about what the right
trajectory is.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.966
And you will find out that most
of the cherished ideas get

00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.010
destroyed.
 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.991
But the good news is that you
need quantum mechanics only to

00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:08.129
study very tiny things like
atoms or molecules.

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:10.281
Of course the big question is,
you know, where do you draw the

00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:10.530
line?
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.959
How small is small?
 

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:15.998
Some people even ask me,
"Do you need quantum

00:01:15.998 --> 00:01:18.849
mechanics to describe the human
brain?"

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:21.637
And the answer is,
"Yes, if it is small

00:01:21.637 --> 00:01:22.610
enough."
 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.289
So, I've gone to parties where
after a few minutes of talking

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.058
to a person I'm thinking,
"Okay, this person's brain

00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:33.120
needs a fully quantum mechanical
treatment."

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.638
But most of the time everything
macroscopic you can describe the

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:39.709
way you do with Newtonian
mechanics, electrodynamics.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:42.569
You don't need quantum theory.
 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.796
All right, so now we'll start
with the brand new force of

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:48.230
electromagnetism.
 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.705
But before doing the force,
I've got to remind you people

00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:55.242
of certain things I expect you
all to understand about the

00:01:55.242 --> 00:01:58.747
dynamics between force,
and mass, and acceleration that

00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:00.629
you must have learned last term.
 

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:01.950
I don't want to take any
chances.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:10.982
I'm going to start by reminding
you how we use this famous

00:02:10.982 --> 00:02:14.310
equation of Newton.
 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.199
So you've seen this equation,
probably,

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.913
in high school,
but it's a lot more subtle than

00:02:18.913 --> 00:02:21.307
you think,
certainly a lot more subtle

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.720
than I thought when I first
learned it.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.491
So I will tell you what I
figured out over these years on

00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:30.318
different ways to look at F =
ma.

00:02:30.318 --> 00:02:33.324
In other words,
if you have the equation what's

00:02:33.324 --> 00:02:34.240
it good for?
 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.644
The only thing anybody knows
right away is a stands

00:02:37.644 --> 00:02:40.450
for acceleration,
and we all know how to measure

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.870
it.
 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.400
By the way, anytime I write any
symbol on the board you should

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.889
be able to tell me how you'd
measure it,

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.598
otherwise you don't know what
you're talking about as a

00:02:49.598 --> 00:02:50.199
physicist.
 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:53.102
Acceleration,
I think I won't spend too much

00:02:53.102 --> 00:02:55.060
time on how you measure it.
 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.610
You should know what
instruments you will need.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.921
So I will remind you that if
you have a meter stick,

00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:04.819
or many meter sticks and clocks
you can follow the body as it

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:05.468
moves.
 

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:08.454
You can find its position now,
its position later,

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.830
take the difference,
divide by the time,

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.110
you get velocity.
 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.143
Then find the velocity now,
find the velocity later,

00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:17.223
take the difference,
divide by time,

00:03:17.223 --> 00:03:18.889
you've got acceleration.
 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.639
So acceleration really requires
three measurements,

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.532
two for each velocity,
but we talk of acceleration

00:03:25.532 --> 00:03:28.721
right now because you can make
those three measurements

00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:32.092
arbitrarily near each other,
and in the limit in which the

00:03:32.092 --> 00:03:34.988
time difference between them
goes to zero you can talk about

00:03:34.988 --> 00:03:37.590
the velocity right now and
acceleration right now.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.292
But in your car,
the needle points at 60 that's

00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:41.819
your velocity right now.
 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.750
It's an instantaneous quantity.
 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.870
And if you step on the gas you
feel this push.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.840
That's your acceleration right
now.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.810
That's a property of that
instant.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.656
So we know acceleration,
but the question is can I use

00:03:55.656 --> 00:03:59.680
the equation to find the mass of
anything.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.078
Now, very often when I pose the
question the answer given is,

00:04:03.078 --> 00:04:05.513
you know, go to a scale,
a weighing machine,

00:04:05.513 --> 00:04:06.758
and find the mass.
 

00:04:06.758 --> 00:04:09.235
And as you know,
that's not the correct answer

00:04:09.235 --> 00:04:12.479
because the weight of an object
is related to being near the

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:16.083
earth due to gravity,
but the mass of an object is

00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:17.480
defined anywhere.
 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.449
So here's one way you can do it.
 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.607
Now you might say, "Well,
take a known force and find the

00:04:23.607 --> 00:04:26.901
acceleration it produces,"
but we haven't talked about how

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:28.550
to measure the force either.
 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.750
All you have is this equation.
 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.841
The correct thing to do is to
buy yourself a spring and go to

00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:43.338
the Bureau of Standards and tell
them to loan you a block of some

00:04:43.338 --> 00:04:45.759
material,
I forgot what it is.

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.220
That's called a kilogram.
 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.060
That is a kilogram by
definition.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.009
There is no God-given way to
define mass.

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.740
You pick a random entity and
say that's a kilogram.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.480
So that's not right and that's
not wrong.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.649
That's what a kilogram is.
 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:03.624
So you bring that kilogram,
you hook it up on the spring,

00:05:03.624 --> 00:05:07.456
and you pull it by some amount,
maybe to that position,

00:05:07.456 --> 00:05:09.088
and you release it.
 

00:05:09.088 --> 00:05:12.562
You notice the acceleration of
the 1 kilogram,

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:15.649
and the mass of the thing is
just one.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.079
Then you detach that mass.
 

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:21.807
Then you ask--Then the person
says, "What's the mass of

00:05:21.807 --> 00:05:23.259
something else?"
 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.149
I don't know what the something
else is.

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:26.990
Let's say a potato.
 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.250
And you take the potato or
anything, elephant.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.750
Here's a potato.
 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.666
You pull that guy by the same
distance, and you release that,

00:05:38.666 --> 00:05:41.290
and you find its acceleration.
 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.581
Since you pulled it by the same
amount, the force is the same,

00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:45.500
whatever it is.
 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.889
We don't know what it is,
but it's the same.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.815
Therefore we know the
acceleration of 1 kilogram times

00:05:51.815 --> 00:05:55.369
1 kilogram is equal to the
unknown mass times the

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:58.110
acceleration of the unknown
mass.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.860
That's how by measuring this
you can find what the mass is.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.939
In principle you can find the
mass of everything.

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:11.141
So imagine masses of all
objects have been determined by

00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:12.560
this process.
 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.226
Then you can also use F =
ma to find out what forces

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:21.089
are acting on bodies in
different situations,

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.783
because if you don't know what
force is acting on a body you

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:24.970
cannot predict anything.
 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.581
So you can go back to the
spring and say,

00:06:27.581 --> 00:06:31.370
"I want to know what force
the spring exerts when it's

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.329
pulled by various amounts.
 

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:36.060
Well, you pull it by some
amount x.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.091
You attach it to a non-mass and
you find the acceleration,

00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:41.720
and that's the force.
 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.461
And if you plot it,
you'll find F as a

00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:50.392
function of x will be
roughly a straight line and it

00:06:50.392 --> 00:06:53.709
will take the form F =
-kx,

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:56.199
and that k is called a
force constant.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:01.125
So this is an example of your
finding out the left hand side

00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:02.629
of Newton's law.
 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:06.567
You've got to understand the
distinction between F =

00:07:06.567 --> 00:07:08.610
-kx and F = ma.
 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.379
What's the difference?
 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:14.237
This says if you know the force
I can tell you the acceleration,

00:07:14.237 --> 00:07:17.910
but it's your job to go find
out every time what forces might

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.379
be acting on a body.
 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:22.132
If it's connected to a spring,
and you pull the spring and it

00:07:22.132 --> 00:07:24.783
exerts a force,
someone's got to make this

00:07:24.783 --> 00:07:28.149
measurement to find out what the
force will be.

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:31.519
All right, so that's one kind
of force.

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:35.797
Another force that you can find
is if you're near the surface of

00:07:35.797 --> 00:07:38.446
the earth,
if you drop something,

00:07:38.446 --> 00:07:41.980
it seems to accelerate towards
the ground,

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:48.079
and everything accelerates by
the same amount g.

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:51.052
Well, according to Newton's
laws if anything is going to

00:07:51.052 --> 00:07:53.699
accelerate, it's because there's
a force on it.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.105
The force on any mass m
must be mg,

00:07:58.105 --> 00:08:03.519
because if I divide by m
I've got to get g.

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:06.769
So the force on masses near the
earth is mg.

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:09.750
That's another force.
 

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.543
Something interesting about
that force is that unlike the

00:08:12.543 --> 00:08:15.240
spring force where the spring is
touching the mass,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.067
you can see it's pulling it,
or when I push this chair you

00:08:18.067 --> 00:08:22.250
can see I'm doing it,
the pull of gravity is a bit

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.779
strange,
because there is no real

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:28.250
contact between the earth and
the object that's falling.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.634
It was a great abstraction to
believe that things can reach

00:08:31.634 --> 00:08:34.610
out and pull things which are
not touching them,

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:39.273
and gravity was the first
formally described force where

00:08:39.273 --> 00:08:40.629
that was true.
 

00:08:40.629 --> 00:08:46.168
And another excursion in the
same theme is if this object

00:08:46.168 --> 00:08:50.375
gets very far,
say like the moon over there,

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:54.120
then the force is not given by
mg,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:09:01.519
but the force is given by this
law of gravitation.

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:03.110
For every r near the
surface of the earth,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.386
if you put r equal to
the surface of the earth you

00:09:06.386 --> 00:09:09.428
will get a constant force that
is just mg,

00:09:09.428 --> 00:09:11.769
but if you move far from the
center of the earth you've got

00:09:11.769 --> 00:09:14.731
to take that into account,
and that's what Newton did and

00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:17.720
realized the force goes like 1
over r^(2).

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.155
So every time things accelerate
you've got to find the reason,

00:09:23.155 --> 00:09:25.918
and that reason is the force.
 

00:09:25.918 --> 00:09:28.759
Many times many forces can be
acting on a body,

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:30.952
and if you put all the forces
that are acting on a body and

00:09:30.952 --> 00:09:33.190
that explains the acceleration,
you're done,

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.090
but sometimes it won't.
 

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.428
That's when you have a new
force.

00:09:38.428 --> 00:09:42.710
And the final application of
F = ma is this one.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.102
If you knew the force,
for example,

00:09:46.102 --> 00:09:49.796
on a planet,
and here's a planet going

00:09:49.796 --> 00:09:53.190
around the sun and it is here.
 

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.841
This is the sun,
and you know the force acting

00:09:55.841 --> 00:09:59.024
on it given by Newton's Law of
Gravity you can find the

00:09:59.024 --> 00:10:02.561
acceleration that will help you
find out where it will be one

00:10:02.561 --> 00:10:06.337
second later,
and you repeat the calculation,

00:10:06.337 --> 00:10:08.769
you will get the trajectory.
 

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:10.558
So F = ma is good for
three things,

00:10:10.558 --> 00:10:13.730
that's what I want you to
understand: to define mass,

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.413
to calculate forces acting on
bodies by seeing how they

00:10:17.413 --> 00:10:20.062
accelerate,
and finally to find the

00:10:20.062 --> 00:10:23.080
acceleration of bodies given the
forces.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.000
This is the cycle of Newtonian
dynamics.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.215
And what I'm going to do now is
to add one more new force,

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:37.705
because I'm going to find out
that there is another force not

00:10:37.705 --> 00:10:39.168
listed here.
 

00:10:39.168 --> 00:10:42.692
I'm going to demonstrate to you
that new force,

00:10:42.692 --> 00:10:43.230
okay?
 

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.990
Here's my demonstration.
 

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.750
The only demonstration you will
see in my class,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.830
because everything else I've
tried generally failed,

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.230
but this one always works.
 

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:01.149
So, I have here a piece of
paper, okay?

00:11:01.149 --> 00:11:05.619
Then I take this trusty comb
and I comb the part of my head

00:11:05.619 --> 00:11:08.470
that's suited for this
experiment,

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:13.893
then I bring it next to this,
and you see I'm able to lift

00:11:13.893 --> 00:11:14.558
that.
 

00:11:14.558 --> 00:11:18.116
Now, that's not the force of
gravity because gravity doesn't

00:11:18.116 --> 00:11:20.649
care if you comb your hair or
not, okay?

00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:25.600
And also when I shake it,
it falls down.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.655
So you're thinking, "Okay,
maybe there is a new force but

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:32.227
it doesn't look awfully strong
because it's not able to even

00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:35.514
overcome gravity,
because it eventually yielded

00:11:35.514 --> 00:11:39.754
to gravity and fell down,"
but it's actually a mistake to

00:11:39.754 --> 00:11:40.590
think so.
 

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.880
In fact this new force that I'm
talking about is 10 to the power

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.408
of 40 stronger than
gravitational force.

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:52.950
I will tell you by what metric
I came up with that number,

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.308
but it's an enormously strong
force.

00:11:55.308 --> 00:11:59.736
You've got to understand why I
say it is such a strong force

00:11:59.736 --> 00:12:03.038
when, when I shook it the thing
fell down.

00:12:03.038 --> 00:12:08.548
So the reason is that if you
look at this experiment,

00:12:08.548 --> 00:12:11.149
here's the comb and here's the
paper,

00:12:11.149 --> 00:12:13.070
the comb is trying to pull the
paper,

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:17.259
but what is trying to pull it
down?

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:21.220
What is trying to pull it down?
 

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.337
So here is me,
here is that comb,

00:12:24.337 --> 00:12:26.190
here's the paper.
 

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:34.260
The entire planet is pulling it
down: Himalayas pulling it down,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.104
Pacific Ocean,
pulling it down,

00:12:38.104 --> 00:12:44.509
Bin Laden sitting in his cave
pulling it down.

00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:47.220
Everything is pulling it down,
okay?

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.729
I am one of these people
generally convinced the world is

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:53.548
acting against me,
but this time I'm right.

00:12:53.548 --> 00:12:57.354
Everything is acting against
me, and I'm able to triumph

00:12:57.354 --> 00:13:00.259
against all of that with this
tiny comb.

00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:03.166
And that is how you compare the
electric force with the

00:13:03.166 --> 00:13:04.350
gravitational force.
 

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.236
It takes the entire planet to
compensate whatever tiny force I

00:13:08.236 --> 00:13:11.360
create between the comb and the
piece of paper.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.582
To really get a number out of
this I'll have to do a little

00:13:13.582 --> 00:13:17.163
more,
but I just want to point out to

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:23.080
you this is a new force much
stronger than gravitation.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.102
So I want to tell you a few
other experiments people did

00:13:27.102 --> 00:13:31.200
without going into what the
explanation is right now,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.590
but let me just tell you if you
go through history what all did

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:36.440
people do.
 

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:42.678
So one experiment you can do:
You take a piece of glass and

00:13:42.678 --> 00:13:49.240
you rub it on some animal that's
passing by, water buffalo.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.580
That's why I cannot do all the
experiments in class.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.456
You rub it on that guy,
then you do it to a second

00:13:56.456 --> 00:13:59.467
piece of glass,
and you find out that they

00:13:59.467 --> 00:14:02.366
repel each other,
meaning if you put them next to

00:14:02.366 --> 00:14:04.330
each other they tend to fly
apart.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:09.264
Then you take a piece of hard
rubber and you rub that on

00:14:09.264 --> 00:14:10.788
something else.
 

00:14:10.788 --> 00:14:14.899
I forgot what,
silk, Yeti, some other thing.

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:15.769
Then you put that here.
 

00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:18.669
So I'll give a different shape
to that thing.

00:14:18.669 --> 00:14:20.129
That's the rubber stick.
 

00:14:20.129 --> 00:14:25.335
And you find when you do that
to this, these two attract each

00:14:25.335 --> 00:14:26.028
other.
 

00:14:26.028 --> 00:14:30.139
Sometimes they repel,
sometimes they attract.

00:14:30.139 --> 00:14:35.048
Here's another thing you can
do: Buy some nylon thread.

00:14:35.048 --> 00:14:39.166
You hang a small metallic
sphere, and you bring one of

00:14:39.166 --> 00:14:41.029
these rods next to it.
 

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:42.908
It doesn't matter which one.
 

00:14:42.908 --> 00:14:48.388
Initially they're attracted and
suddenly when you touch it and

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.890
you remove it,
they start repelling each

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:52.789
other.
 

00:14:52.789 --> 00:14:53.690
What's going on?
 

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.149
That's another thing you could
do.

00:14:56.149 --> 00:15:01.389
Last thing I want to mention is
if you took two of these things

00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:05.110
which are repelling each other,
let's say.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.528
Let's say they're attracting
each other like this.

00:15:08.528 --> 00:15:12.871
Then you connect them with a
piece of nylon and you take it

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:14.668
away, nothing happens.
 

00:15:14.668 --> 00:15:19.109
If you connect them with a
piece of wire and take away the

00:15:19.109 --> 00:15:22.379
wire, they no longer attract
each other.

00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:24.158
So these are examples of
different things.

00:15:24.158 --> 00:15:26.018
I'm just going to say,
you do this,

00:15:26.018 --> 00:15:27.330
you do this,
you do that,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.610
then finally you need a theory
that explains everything.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.308
So that's the theory that I'm
going to give you now.

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:36.808
That's the theory of
electrostatics.

00:15:36.808 --> 00:15:40.335
And I don't have time to go
into the entire history of how

00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:42.808
people arrived at this final
formula,

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:48.773
so I'm just going to tell you
one formula that really will

00:15:48.773 --> 00:15:53.899
explain everything that I've
described so far,

00:15:53.899 --> 00:16:00.009
and that formula is called
Coulomb's Law.

00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:02.727
Even though Mr. Coulomb's
name is on it,

00:16:02.727 --> 00:16:06.908
he was not the first one to
formulate parts of the law,

00:16:06.908 --> 00:16:10.990
but he gave the final and
direct verification of Coulomb's

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.139
Law that other people who had
contributed.

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:20.590
So Coulomb's Law says that
certain entities have a property

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.370
called charge.
 

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.767
You have charge or you don't
have charge, but if you have

00:16:26.767 --> 00:16:31.163
charge the charge that you have,
you meaning any of these

00:16:31.163 --> 00:16:34.070
objects, is measured in
coulombs.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.469
Remember, that was not
Coulomb's idea to call it

00:16:36.469 --> 00:16:36.980
coulomb.
 

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.436
Whenever you make a discovery,
you're breathlessly waiting

00:16:39.436 --> 00:16:41.158
that somebody will name it after
you,

00:16:41.158 --> 00:16:44.330
but it's not in good taste to
name to after yourself,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.149
but it carries Coulomb's name.
 

00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:48.774
So he didn't say call it
coulomb, okay,

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:51.470
but he certainly wrote down
this law.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:55.515
The law says that if you've got
one entity which has some amount

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:58.149
of charge called
q_1,

00:16:58.149 --> 00:17:01.408
and there's another entity that
has some amount of charge

00:17:01.408 --> 00:17:04.726
q_2 they will
exert a force on each other

00:17:04.726 --> 00:17:06.704
which is given by
q_1q

00:17:06.704 --> 00:17:09.731
_2 times this
constant which is somehow

00:17:09.731 --> 00:17:11.711
written as 1 over
4Πε

00:17:11.711 --> 00:17:13.690
_0.
 

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.009
That's 1 over r^(2).
 

00:17:17.009 --> 00:17:18.887
But r is the distance
between them,

00:17:18.887 --> 00:17:21.223
and you can ask in this
picture, what do you mean by

00:17:21.223 --> 00:17:21.818
distance?
 

00:17:21.818 --> 00:17:24.525
I mean, is it from here to
there, or is it from center to

00:17:24.525 --> 00:17:24.960
center?
 

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.837
We're assuming here that the
distance between them is much

00:17:28.837 --> 00:17:31.220
bigger than the individual
sizes.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.422
For example,
you say, how far am I from Los

00:17:33.422 --> 00:17:34.786
Angeles, well,
3,225 miles,

00:17:34.786 --> 00:17:37.880
but you can say are you taking
about your right hand or your

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.720
left hand?
 

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.873
Well, I'm a point particle for
this purpose so it doesn't

00:17:41.873 --> 00:17:42.380
matter.
 

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.585
So here we're assuming that
either they're mathematically

00:17:45.585 --> 00:17:48.961
point charges or they're real
charges with a finite size but

00:17:48.961 --> 00:17:52.108
separated by a distance much
bigger than the size,

00:17:52.108 --> 00:17:53.990
so r could stand,
if you like,

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.549
for center to center.
 

00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:58.630
It doesn't matter too much.
 

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.930
So this is what Coulomb said.
 

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.058
Now, if you look at this number
here,

00:18:03.058 --> 00:18:05.858
1 over 4Πε
_0,

00:18:05.858 --> 00:18:12.009
its value is 9 times 10 to the
9^(th).

00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:16.307
What that means is the
following: If you take one body

00:18:16.307 --> 00:18:20.653
with 1 coulomb of charge,
another body with 1 coulomb of

00:18:20.653 --> 00:18:23.558
charge and they're separated by
1 meter,

00:18:23.558 --> 00:18:27.259
then the force between them
will be this number,

00:18:27.259 --> 00:18:28.880
because everything else is a 1.
 

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.440
It'll be 9 times 10 to the 9
newtons.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.998
That's an enormous force,
and normally you don't run into

00:18:34.998 --> 00:18:37.507
1 coulomb of charge,
but the reason why a coulomb

00:18:37.507 --> 00:18:40.732
was picked is sort of historical
and it has to do with currents

00:18:40.732 --> 00:18:41.410
and so on.
 

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:45.048
But anyway, this is the
definition.

00:18:45.048 --> 00:18:49.170
But if you want to be more
precise, I should write a

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.288
formula more carefully because
force is a vector.

00:18:53.288 --> 00:18:58.118
Also I should say force on whom
and due to what.

00:18:58.118 --> 00:19:01.358
So let's say there are two
charges,

00:19:01.358 --> 00:19:05.339
and say q_1 is
sitting at the origin and

00:19:05.339 --> 00:19:09.817
q_2 is sitting
at a point whose position is the

00:19:09.817 --> 00:19:11.240
vector r.
 

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:17.336
Then the force on 2 due to 1 is
given by q_2q

00:19:17.336 --> 00:19:22.790
_1 over
4Πε_0

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:27.068
times 1 over
r^(2).

00:19:27.068 --> 00:19:30.281
That's the magnitude of the
force, but I want to suggest

00:19:30.281 --> 00:19:33.436
that the force is such that
q_1 pushes

00:19:33.436 --> 00:19:35.190
q_2 away.
 

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.127
So I want to make this into a
vector, but I've got the

00:19:38.127 --> 00:19:39.568
magnitude of the vector.
 

00:19:39.568 --> 00:19:42.580
As you know,
to make a real vector you take

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:47.096
its magnitude and multiply it by
a vector of unit length in that

00:19:47.096 --> 00:19:48.460
same direction.
 

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.150
The unit vector we can write in
many ways.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.286
One is just to say
e_r,

00:19:53.286 --> 00:19:56.654
e_r_
is a standard name for a

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:59.779
vector of length 1 in the
direction of r.

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:01.298
But I'll give you another
choice.

00:20:01.298 --> 00:20:04.483
You can also write it as
r divided by the length

00:20:04.483 --> 00:20:05.308
of r.
 

00:20:05.308 --> 00:20:08.058
That also would be a vector of
unit length parallel to

00:20:08.058 --> 00:20:08.630
r.
 

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.799
So there are many ways to write
the thing that makes it a

00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:12.308
vector.
 

00:20:12.308 --> 00:20:24.269
And F_21 is
minus of F_12.

00:20:24.269 --> 00:20:28.990
Now, how do we get attraction
and how do we get repulsion?

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.300
We get it because
q_1 and

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.509
q_2,
if they're both positive and

00:20:32.509 --> 00:20:35.665
you if you use the formula,
you'll find they repel each

00:20:35.665 --> 00:20:38.259
other, but if they're of
opposite signs,

00:20:38.259 --> 00:20:40.830
you'll do the same calculation,
but you'll put a minus sign in

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:41.970
front of the whole thing.
 

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:46.670
That'll turn repulsion into an
attraction.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.105
So you must allow for the
possibility that q can be

00:20:50.105 --> 00:20:53.048
of either sign;
q can also be 0.

00:20:53.048 --> 00:20:55.942
There are certain entities
which don't have any electric

00:20:55.942 --> 00:20:59.097
charge, so if you put them next
to a million coulombs nothing

00:20:59.097 --> 00:20:59.730
happens.
 

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.900
So some things have plus charge.
 

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.288
Some things have minus charge.
 

00:21:02.288 --> 00:21:09.337
Some things have no charge,
but they're all contained in

00:21:09.337 --> 00:21:12.028
this Coulomb's Law.
 

00:21:12.028 --> 00:21:16.307
Now, again, skipping all the
intermediate discoveries,

00:21:16.307 --> 00:21:21.230
I want to tell you a couple of
things we know about charge.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:30.358
First thing is - q is
conserved.

00:21:30.358 --> 00:21:34.506
Conserved is a physics terms
for saying--does not change with

00:21:34.506 --> 00:21:34.990
time.
 

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.674
For example,
when you say energy is

00:21:36.674 --> 00:21:39.069
conserved,
it means particles can come and

00:21:39.069 --> 00:21:41.160
collide and do all kinds of
things,

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.281
but if you add that energy
before, you'll get the same

00:21:44.281 --> 00:21:47.098
answer afterwards,
and whenever that happens,

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:48.740
the quantity is conserved.
 

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.298
The claim is electrical charge
is conserved.

00:21:52.298 --> 00:21:55.700
So electrical charge may
migrate from A to B or B to A,

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.029
but if you add up the total
charge,

00:21:57.029 --> 00:22:00.250
say the chemical reaction of
any process,

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.913
including in big particle
accelerators where things

00:22:02.913 --> 00:22:05.630
collide and all kinds of stuff
comes flying out,

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.990
the charge of the final
products always equal to the

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.230
charge of the incoming products.
 

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:16.278
But charge conservation needs
to be amended with one extra

00:22:16.278 --> 00:22:18.759
term, extra qualification.
 

00:22:18.759 --> 00:22:22.278
It's called local.
 

00:22:22.278 --> 00:22:26.327
Suppose I say the number of
students in the class is

00:22:26.327 --> 00:22:27.278
conserved?
 

00:22:27.278 --> 00:22:31.078
That means you count them any
time, you've got to get the same

00:22:31.078 --> 00:22:31.640
number.
 

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.880
Well, here's one possibility.
 

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:39.589
Suddenly one of you guys
disappears and appears here at

00:22:39.589 --> 00:22:41.598
the same instant.
 

00:22:41.598 --> 00:22:44.611
That's also consistent with
conservation of student number

00:22:44.611 --> 00:22:46.460
because the number didn't
change.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.348
What disappeared there,
appeared here.

00:22:50.348 --> 00:22:53.174
But that is not a local
conservation of charge because

00:22:53.174 --> 00:22:56.373
it disappears in one part of the
world and appears in another

00:22:56.373 --> 00:22:56.798
one.
 

00:22:56.798 --> 00:23:03.038
And it's not even a meaningful
law to have in the presence of

00:23:03.038 --> 00:23:04.390
relativity.
 

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:09.808
Can any of you guys think of
why that might be true,

00:23:09.808 --> 00:23:13.568
why a charge disappearing
somewhere and appearing

00:23:13.568 --> 00:23:17.720
somewhere else cannot be a very
profound principle?

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.650
Yes?
 

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:19.240
Student: 
&gt;

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.980
Prof: Yep?
 

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.799
Student:  Well,
if it's in the same instant

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:24.844
disappearing from one place and
appearing another place,

00:23:24.844 --> 00:23:26.220
it's traveling faster than
light?

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.503
Prof: Well,
we don't know that it was the

00:23:29.503 --> 00:23:31.740
same thing that even traveled.
 

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.630
It may not have traveled.
 

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.838
It may even be--Here's another
thing.

00:23:36.838 --> 00:23:40.049
Suppose an electron,
suppose a proton disappears

00:23:40.049 --> 00:23:42.509
there and a positron appears
here.

00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:45.661
That still conserves charge,
but we don't think that the

00:23:45.661 --> 00:23:48.470
proton traveled and became the
positron, right?

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.960
So it is not that it has
traveled.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.390
You are right.
 

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:53.509
I hadn't thought about that.
 

00:23:53.509 --> 00:23:56.882
It's a good point that it
implies it traveled infinitely

00:23:56.882 --> 00:24:00.009
fast, but that's not the reason
you object to it.

00:24:00.009 --> 00:24:00.808
Yep?
 

00:24:00.808 --> 00:24:03.980
Student:  It's not
necessarily simultaneous.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.160
Prof: That is the
correct answer.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.369
The answer is it is not
simultaneous in every frame of

00:24:10.369 --> 00:24:11.548
reference.
 

00:24:11.548 --> 00:24:14.645
You must know from the special
theory that if two events are

00:24:14.645 --> 00:24:16.848
simultaneous in one frame of
reference,

00:24:16.848 --> 00:24:19.598
if you see those same two
events in a moving train,

00:24:19.598 --> 00:24:23.598
or plane, or anything they will
not be simultaneous.

00:24:23.598 --> 00:24:26.288
Therefore, in any other frame
of reference,

00:24:26.288 --> 00:24:29.491
either the charge would have
been created first and then

00:24:29.491 --> 00:24:32.230
after a period of time
reappeared somewhere,

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.529
I mean, destroyed somewhere and
appeared after a delay,

00:24:35.529 --> 00:24:38.558
or the appearance could take
place before the destruction,

00:24:38.558 --> 00:24:41.490
so suddenly you've got two
charges.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:48.130
So conservation of charge,
which is conserved non-locally,

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.797
cannot have a significance
except in one frame of

00:24:50.797 --> 00:24:52.862
reference,
but if you believe that all

00:24:52.862 --> 00:24:55.844
observers are equivalent and you
want to write down laws that

00:24:55.844 --> 00:24:58.279
make sense for everybody it can
only be local.

00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:01.914
So electrical charge is
conserved and it is local,

00:25:01.914 --> 00:25:03.400
locally conserved.
 

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.329
In other words,
stuff doesn't just disappear.

00:25:05.329 --> 00:25:07.210
Stuff just moves around.
 

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.681
You can keep track of it,
and if you add it up you get

00:25:10.681 --> 00:25:11.858
the same number.
 

00:25:11.858 --> 00:25:19.740
The second part of q,
which is not necessary for any

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:27.618
of these older phenomena,
is that q is quantized.

00:25:27.618 --> 00:25:32.971
That means the electrical
charge that we run into does not

00:25:32.971 --> 00:25:36.538
take a continuum of possible
values.

00:25:36.538 --> 00:25:38.279
For example,
the length of any object,

00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:40.490
you might think at least in
classical mechanics,

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:41.759
is any number you like.
 

00:25:41.759 --> 00:25:45.549
It's a continuous variable,
but electric charge is not

00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:46.480
continuous.
 

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.189
As far as we can tell,
all the charges we have ever

00:25:50.189 --> 00:25:54.640
seen are all multiples of a
certain basic unit of charge,

00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:04.048
which turns out to be 1.6 times
10 to the -19 coulombs.

00:26:04.048 --> 00:26:07.028
Every charge is either that or
some multiple of it.

00:26:07.028 --> 00:26:11.259
Multiple could be plus or minus
multiple.

00:26:11.259 --> 00:26:16.650
So charge is granular,
not continuous.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:22.067
Okay, so I'm going to give you
a little more knowledge we have

00:26:22.067 --> 00:26:27.041
had since the time of Coulomb
that sort or explains these

00:26:27.041 --> 00:26:28.019
things.
 

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:31.200
I mean, what's really going on
microscopically?

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.950
We don't have to pretend we
don't know.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:37.598
We do, so we might as well use
that information from now on.

00:26:37.598 --> 00:26:42.040
What we do know is that
everything is made up of atoms,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.400
and that if you look into the
atom it's got a nucleus,

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.950
a lot of guys sitting here.
 

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:53.440
Some are called protons and
some are called neutrons,

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.880
and then there are some guys
running around called electrons.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.903
Of course we will see at the
end of the semester that this

00:27:02.903 --> 00:27:06.221
picture is wrong,
but it is good enough for this

00:27:06.221 --> 00:27:07.068
purpose.
 

00:27:07.068 --> 00:27:11.316
It's certainly true that there
are charges in an atom which are

00:27:11.316 --> 00:27:15.220
near the center and other light
charges which are near the

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.068
periphery, are outside.
 

00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:21.019
All things carrying electric
charge in our world in daily

00:27:21.019 --> 00:27:23.769
life are either protons or
electrons.

00:27:23.769 --> 00:27:26.910
You can produce strange
particles in an accelerator.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.608
They would also carry some
charge which would in fact be a

00:27:29.608 --> 00:27:32.308
multiple of this charge,
but they don't live very long.

00:27:32.308 --> 00:27:36.096
So the stable things that you
and I are made of and just about

00:27:36.096 --> 00:27:39.634
everything in this room is made
of, is made up of protons,

00:27:39.634 --> 00:27:41.308
neutrons and electrons.
 

00:27:41.308 --> 00:27:46.125
The charge of the neutron,
as you can guess,

00:27:46.125 --> 00:27:46.910
is 0.
 

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:51.804
The charge of the electron,
by some strange convention,

00:27:51.804 --> 00:27:55.430
was given this minus sign by
Franklin.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:04.211
And the charge of the proton is
plus 1.6 times into -19

00:28:04.211 --> 00:28:06.000
coulombs.
 

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.930
There are a lot of amazing
things I find here.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:14.078
I don't know if you've thought
about it.

00:28:14.078 --> 00:28:18.402
The first interesting thing is
that every electron anywhere in

00:28:18.402 --> 00:28:21.450
the universe has exactly the
same charge.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.829
It also has exactly the same
mass.

00:28:24.829 --> 00:28:27.403
Now, you might say, "Look,
that's a tautology,"

00:28:27.403 --> 00:28:30.636
because if it wasn't the same
charge and if it wasn't the same

00:28:30.636 --> 00:28:32.808
mass you would call it something
else.

00:28:32.808 --> 00:28:36.431
But what makes it a non-empty
statement is that there are

00:28:36.431 --> 00:28:39.083
many, many, many,
many electrons which are

00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:40.700
absolutely identical.
 

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.430
Look, you try to manufacture
two cars.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.560
The chance that they're
identical is 0,

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.009
right?
 

00:28:46.009 --> 00:28:49.089
I got one of those cars so I
know that.

00:28:49.089 --> 00:28:50.079
It doesn't work.
 

00:28:50.079 --> 00:28:51.529
It's supposed to.
 

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:56.251
So despite all the best efforts
people make, things are not

00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:57.230
identical.
 

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:01.368
But at the microscopic level of
electrons and protons,

00:29:01.368 --> 00:29:05.509
every proton anywhere in the
universe is identical.

00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:08.150
And they can be manufactured in
a collision in another part of

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:08.798
the universe.
 

00:29:08.798 --> 00:29:11.922
This can be manufactured in a
collision in Geneva,

00:29:11.922 --> 00:29:14.278
the stuff that comes out
identical.

00:29:14.278 --> 00:29:17.330
That is a mystery,
at least in classical mechanics

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:18.390
it's a mystery.
 

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:22.170
Quantum Field Theory gives you
an answer to at least why all

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.182
electrons are identical,
and why all protons are

00:29:25.182 --> 00:29:26.078
identical.
 

00:29:26.078 --> 00:29:29.179
The fact that they're
absolutely identical particles

00:29:29.179 --> 00:29:30.759
is very, very important.
 

00:29:30.759 --> 00:29:34.509
It also makes your life easy,
because if every particle was

00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:38.065
different from every other
particle, you cannot make any

00:29:38.065 --> 00:29:39.098
predictions.
 

00:29:39.098 --> 00:29:42.499
We know that the hydrogen atom
on a receding galaxy is

00:29:42.499 --> 00:29:45.450
identical to the hydrogen atom
on the Earth.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.016
That's why when the radiation
coming from the atom has a

00:29:48.016 --> 00:29:50.910
shifted wavelength of frequency,
we attributed to the motion of

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:51.608
the galaxy.
 

00:29:51.608 --> 00:29:55.269
From the Doppler Shift we find
out its speed.

00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:58.079
But another explanation could
be, well, that's a different

00:29:58.079 --> 00:29:58.868
hydrogen atom.
 

00:29:58.868 --> 00:30:01.058
Maybe that's why the answer's
different.

00:30:01.058 --> 00:30:04.112
But we all believe it's the
same hydrogen atom,

00:30:04.112 --> 00:30:06.170
but it's moving away from us.
 

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:10.309
Therefore, one of the
remarkable things is that all

00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:13.538
electrons and all protons are
equal,

00:30:13.538 --> 00:30:17.450
but a really big mystery is why
is the charge of the electron

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:20.970
exactly equal and opposite the
charge of the proton.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:22.059
They are not the same particle.
 

00:30:22.059 --> 00:30:23.788
Their masses are different.
 

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:25.588
Their other interactions are
different.

00:30:25.588 --> 00:30:29.692
But in terms of electrical
charge these two numbers are

00:30:29.692 --> 00:30:32.960
absolutely equal as far as
anybody knows.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.230
That's another mystery.
 

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:38.746
Two different particles,
not related by any manifest

00:30:38.746 --> 00:30:42.376
family relationship,
have the same charge,

00:30:42.376 --> 00:30:44.058
except in sign.
 

00:30:44.058 --> 00:30:46.895
And there are theories called
Grand Unified Theories which try

00:30:46.895 --> 00:30:49.799
to explain this,
but certainly not part of any

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:53.935
standard established theory,
but it's key to everything we

00:30:53.935 --> 00:30:58.452
see in daily life because that's
what makes the atom electrically

00:30:58.452 --> 00:30:59.230
neutral.
 

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:03.390
Okay, now we can understand the
quantization of charge,

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:05.855
because charge is carried by
these guys and these guys are

00:31:05.855 --> 00:31:09.048
either there or not there,
so you can only have so many

00:31:09.048 --> 00:31:09.808
electrons.
 

00:31:09.808 --> 00:31:14.548
We cannot have a part of an
electron, or part of a proton.

00:31:14.548 --> 00:31:19.976
Now, let's try to understand
all these experiments in terms

00:31:19.976 --> 00:31:21.660
of what we know.
 

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.733
First of all,
when you take this piece of

00:31:24.733 --> 00:31:29.038
glass, and you rub it,
the atoms in glass are neutral.

00:31:29.038 --> 00:31:31.560
They've got equal number of
protons and electrons,

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.876
but when you rub it,
the glass atom loses some

00:31:33.876 --> 00:31:36.088
electrons to whatever you rubbed
it on.

00:31:36.088 --> 00:31:39.520
Therefore, it becomes
positively charged,

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.210
because some negative has been
taken out.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:47.413
In the case of the rubber
stick, it gains the electrons

00:31:47.413 --> 00:31:52.318
and whatever animal you rubbed
it on, it loses the electrons.

00:31:52.318 --> 00:31:55.509
So actually real charge
transfer takes place only

00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:56.838
through electrons.
 

00:31:56.838 --> 00:31:59.442
Protons carry charge,
but you are never going to rip

00:31:59.442 --> 00:32:01.740
a proton out unless you use an
accelerator.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.730
It's really deeply bound to the
nucleus.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:07.690
Electrons are the ones who do
all the business of electricity

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:08.480
in daily life.
 

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.866
The current flowing in the
wire, in the circuit,

00:32:11.866 --> 00:32:14.390
it's all the motion of
electrons.

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:19.916
So from this and Coulomb's Law,
can you understand the

00:32:19.916 --> 00:32:23.150
attraction between these two?
 

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:26.702
How many people think you can,
from Coulomb's Law,

00:32:26.702 --> 00:32:30.400
understand the attraction
between these two rods?

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.279
Nobody thinks you can?
 

00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:36.569
Well, why do you think you
cannot?

00:32:36.569 --> 00:32:37.680
You know why?
 

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.640
Student:  Because
they're not point charges?

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:46.589
Prof: Okay,
any other reason why Coulomb's

00:32:46.589 --> 00:32:49.068
Law is not enough?
 

00:32:49.068 --> 00:32:52.105
Well, how will we apply
Coulomb's Law to understand the

00:32:52.105 --> 00:32:54.130
attraction between these two
rods?

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:55.910
What will you have to do?
 

00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:00.519
Student:  You'd have to
apply it to F = ma.

00:33:00.519 --> 00:33:01.750
Prof: No.
 

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:04.371
Once you got the F, the
a will follow,

00:33:04.371 --> 00:33:06.890
but can you compute the force
between two rods?

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.900
One of them has got a lot of
positive charge.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.936
One of them has a lot of
negative charge given Coulomb's

00:33:10.936 --> 00:33:11.160
Law.
 

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.220
Yes?
 

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.269
Student:  You don't know
the exact quantities of the

00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.432
charges..
 

00:33:13.432 --> 00:33:13.847
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:33:13.847 --> 00:33:14.897
Student:  You don't know
the exact quantities of the

00:33:14.897 --> 00:33:15.170
charges.
 

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.868
Prof: Suppose I tell you.
 

00:33:16.868 --> 00:33:18.789
I tell you how many charges
there are.

00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:19.750
Yes?
 

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.861
Student:  You don't
which direction the attraction

00:33:21.861 --> 00:33:22.048
is.
 

00:33:22.048 --> 00:33:25.258
Prof: No,
we do know, because the plus

00:33:25.258 --> 00:33:28.539
and minus will be drawn towards
each other.

00:33:28.539 --> 00:33:29.960
Okay, I'll tell you what it is.
 

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.894
It's an assumption we all make,
but you're not really supposed

00:33:32.894 --> 00:33:33.519
to make it.
 

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:36.019
It's not a consequence of any
logic.

00:33:36.019 --> 00:33:41.009
Coulomb's Law talks about two
charges, two point charges.

00:33:41.009 --> 00:33:45.298
What if there are three charges
in the universe?

00:33:45.298 --> 00:33:49.720
What is the force this one will
experience due to these two?

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.880
This is q_1.
 

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.609
This is q_2.
 

00:33:51.609 --> 00:33:53.930
This is q_3.
 

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.150
Coulomb's Law doesn't tell you
that.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:02.479
It tells you only two at a
time, but we make an extra

00:34:02.479 --> 00:34:10.025
assumption called superposition
which says that if you want the

00:34:10.025 --> 00:34:14.396
force on 3 (should read 1),
when there is

00:34:14.396 --> 00:34:16.159
q_1 and
q_2,

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:20.619
you find the force due to
q_2 and you

00:34:20.619 --> 00:34:25.079
find the force due to
q_3 and you add

00:34:25.079 --> 00:34:26.090
them up.
 

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:34.139
The fact that you can add these
two vectors is not a logical

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:36.050
requirement.
 

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.800
In fact, it's not even true at
an extremely accurate level that

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.612
the force between two charges is
not affected by the presence of

00:34:43.612 --> 00:34:44.579
a third one.
 

00:34:44.579 --> 00:34:46.168
But it's an excellent
approximation,

00:34:46.168 --> 00:34:48.753
but you must realize it is
something you've got to find to

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:49.980
be true experimentally.
 

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.820
It's not something you can say
is logical consequence.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.577
Logically there is no reason
why the interaction between two

00:34:57.577 --> 00:35:01.719
entities should not be affected
by the presence of a third one.

00:35:01.719 --> 00:35:05.929
But it seems to be a very good
approximation for what we do,

00:35:05.929 --> 00:35:08.911
and that's the reason why
eventually we can find the force

00:35:08.911 --> 00:35:12.121
between an extended object,
another extended object by

00:35:12.121 --> 00:35:15.846
looking at the force on everyone
of these due to everyone of

00:35:15.846 --> 00:35:18.119
those and adding all the
vectors.

00:35:18.119 --> 00:35:21.739
Okay, so superposition plus
Coulomb's Law is what you need.

00:35:21.739 --> 00:35:24.989
Then you can certainly
understand the attraction.

00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:29.639
How about the comb and the
piece of paper?

00:35:29.639 --> 00:35:32.331
That's a very interesting
example and it's connected to

00:35:32.331 --> 00:35:32.880
this one.
 

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.980
See, the piece of paper is
electrically neutral.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.280
So let me do paper and comb
instead of this one.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.909
It's got the same model.
 

00:35:40.909 --> 00:35:42.639
Here's the piece of paper.
 

00:35:42.639 --> 00:35:43.559
Here's the comb.
 

00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:47.559
The comb is positively charged.
 

00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:49.639
The paper is neutral.
 

00:35:49.639 --> 00:35:52.360
So anyway, there's nothing here
to be attracted to this one,

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:56.838
but if you bring it close
enough, there are equal amount

00:35:56.838 --> 00:35:59.768
of positive and negative
charges,

00:35:59.768 --> 00:36:03.869
but what will happen is the
negative charges will migrate

00:36:03.869 --> 00:36:07.530
near these positive charges from
the other end,

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:11.050
leaving positive charges in the
back,

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.643
so that the system will
separate into a little bit of

00:36:13.643 --> 00:36:17.827
negative closer to the positive,
and the leftover positive will

00:36:17.827 --> 00:36:19.210
be further away.
 

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.911
Therefore, even though it's
neutral the attraction of plus

00:36:22.911 --> 00:36:26.940
for this minus is stronger than
the repulsion of this plus with

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.849
this plus.
 

00:36:27.849 --> 00:36:29.380
That's called polarization.
 

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.510
So polarization is when charge
separates.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.706
Some materials cannot be
polarized, in which case no

00:36:34.706 --> 00:36:37.119
matter how much you do this with
a comb it won't work.

00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:39.090
Some materials can be polarized.
 

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.507
The piece of paper is an
example of what can be

00:36:42.507 --> 00:36:43.400
polarized.
 

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.960
We can understand that too.
 

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.748
And in this example,
if you bring a lot of plus

00:36:47.748 --> 00:36:50.367
charges here,
and you look at what's going on

00:36:50.367 --> 00:36:52.617
here,
the minus guys here will sit

00:36:52.617 --> 00:36:55.969
here and the plus will be left
over in the back,

00:36:55.969 --> 00:36:59.045
and then this attraction
between plus and minus is bigger

00:36:59.045 --> 00:37:02.880
than this repulsion,
so it will be attracted to it.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.155
But once it touches it,
this rod touches that,

00:37:06.155 --> 00:37:09.869
then what you have is a lot of
plus charges here.

00:37:09.869 --> 00:37:11.639
They repel each other.
 

00:37:11.639 --> 00:37:12.989
They want to get out.
 

00:37:12.989 --> 00:37:14.179
Previously they couldn't get
out.

00:37:14.179 --> 00:37:17.365
They were stuck on the rod,
but now that you've made

00:37:17.365 --> 00:37:20.239
contact, some of them will jump
to that one.

00:37:20.239 --> 00:37:23.500
Then when you separate them,
you will have a ball with some

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.793
plus charges,
and you will have a rod with

00:37:25.793 --> 00:37:31.880
more plus charges,
and they will repel each other.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.431
And finally I said if you take
two of these spheres,

00:37:35.431 --> 00:37:39.123
suppose one was positively
charged, one was negatively

00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:42.119
charged, they're attracting each
other.

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:45.329
If you connect them with a
nylon wire or a wooden stick

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:48.231
nothing happens,
but if you connect them with an

00:37:48.231 --> 00:37:51.043
electrical wire,
what happens is that the extra

00:37:51.043 --> 00:37:53.719
negative charges here will go to
that side,

00:37:53.719 --> 00:37:59.556
and then when you are done they
will both become electrically

00:37:59.556 --> 00:38:00.530
neutral.
 

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:02.429
Okay, so that's why.
 

00:38:02.429 --> 00:38:06.036
So the point of this one is:
electric charges can flow

00:38:06.036 --> 00:38:09.440
through some materials,
but not other materials.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.706
If it can flow through some
materials, it's called a

00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:12.239
conductor.
 

00:38:12.239 --> 00:38:15.269
If it cannot flow through them,
it's called an insulator.

00:38:15.269 --> 00:38:17.340
So real life you've got both.
 

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.349
So when you're changing the
light bulb,

00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:21.943
if you don't want to get an
electric shock you're supposed

00:38:21.943 --> 00:38:24.809
to stand on a piece of wood
before you stick your finger in,

00:38:24.809 --> 00:38:26.789
unless you've got other
intentions.

00:38:26.789 --> 00:38:31.271
Then, you will find that you
don't get the shock because the

00:38:31.271 --> 00:38:33.929
wood doesn't conduct
electricity.

00:38:33.929 --> 00:38:37.516
But if you stand on a metallic
stool, on a metallic floor and

00:38:37.516 --> 00:38:41.041
put your hand in the socket,
you'll be part of an electrical

00:38:41.041 --> 00:38:41.760
circuit.
 

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.436
The human body is a good
conductor of electricity,

00:38:44.436 --> 00:38:47.713
but what saves you is that it
cannot go from your feet to the

00:38:47.713 --> 00:38:48.260
floor.
 

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.599
Now, there are also
semiconductors,

00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:52.501
which are somewhere in between,
but in our course either we'll

00:38:52.501 --> 00:38:54.822
talk about insulators,
which don't conduct

00:38:54.822 --> 00:38:57.090
electricity, and perfect
conductors,

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:59.920
which conduct electricity.
 

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:05.539
Okay, so a summary of what I've
said so far is that there's a

00:39:05.539 --> 00:39:07.599
new force in nature.
 

00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:11.650
To be part of that game you
have to have charge.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.130
If you have no charge,
you cannot play that game.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:16.099
Like neutrons cannot play this
game.

00:39:16.099 --> 00:39:19.963
Nothing's attracted or repelled
by neutrons and neutrons cannot

00:39:19.963 --> 00:39:21.710
attract or repel anything.
 

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:23.369
So you've got to have electric
charge.

00:39:23.369 --> 00:39:26.329
It happens to be measured in
coulombs.

00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:28.420
So let me ask you another
question.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:36.820
Suppose I tell you,
here is Coulombs Law.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:41.213
Let me just write the number 1
over 4Πε

00:39:41.213 --> 00:39:43.409
_0.
 

00:39:43.409 --> 00:39:47.099
How are we going to test that
this law is correct?

00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:47.969
Okay, I'm giving you a bonus.
 

00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:49.070
You don't have to discover the
law.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.619
I'm giving you the law.
 

00:39:50.619 --> 00:39:55.400
All you have to do is to verify
it, and don't use any other

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.780
definitions other than this law
itself.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.668
How will you know it depends on
q_1 and

00:40:00.668 --> 00:40:02.010
q_2 in this
fashion?

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.079
How will you know it depends on
r in that fashion?

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:06.980
That's what I'm asking you.
 

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:16.215
Can anybody think of some
setup, some experiment you will

00:40:16.215 --> 00:40:17.039
do?
 

00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:18.190
Let me ask an easier question.
 

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:23.670
How will you know it goes like
1 over r^(2)?

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.179
Yep?
 

00:40:25.179 --> 00:40:26.827
Student:  Vary the
distance between them,

00:40:26.827 --> 00:40:28.090
and show that the force falls
off.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.751
Prof: Well,
you're right that if you vary

00:40:30.751 --> 00:40:34.059
the distance between them and
show the force falls like that,

00:40:34.059 --> 00:40:40.389
but how do you know what the
force is?

00:40:40.389 --> 00:40:41.099
Yes?
 

00:40:41.099 --> 00:40:42.630
Student:  Could you use
a spring here?

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.739
Prof: What was your plan?
 

00:40:43.739 --> 00:40:46.559
Student:  Observe
acceleration.

00:40:46.559 --> 00:40:47.110
Prof: You are right.
 

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.320
Both of you are right.
 

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.262
You can maybe hold this guy
fixed, and let this go,

00:40:53.262 --> 00:40:55.550
and see how it accelerates.
 

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:59.425
And if you knew the mass of
this guy then you know the

00:40:59.425 --> 00:41:00.010
force.
 

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:02.753
Then you can vary the distance
to another distance,

00:41:02.753 --> 00:41:04.179
maybe half the distance.
 

00:41:04.179 --> 00:41:07.197
At half the distance if you get
four times the force you

00:41:07.197 --> 00:41:09.119
verified 1 over r^(2
)law.

00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:11.110
The other one is with the
spring.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.420
You can take a spring.
 

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:17.119
Say maybe there are two metals,
uncharged objects,

00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:20.550
then you dump some charge on
this and some charge on that,

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:24.039
and then the spring will
expand, and you can see what

00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:28.177
force the spring expands,
exerts, and see if it is

00:41:28.177 --> 00:41:31.659
proportional to 1 over
r^(2).

00:41:31.659 --> 00:41:34.760
That's how Newton deduced the 1
over r^(2) force law.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:38.592
He found the acceleration of
the apple is 3,600 times the

00:41:38.592 --> 00:41:41.739
acceleration of the moon towards
the earth,

00:41:41.739 --> 00:41:44.449
and the moon was 60 times
further than the apple,

00:41:44.449 --> 00:41:46.699
and 60 squared is 3,600.
 

00:41:46.699 --> 00:41:49.320
That's how he found 1 over
r^(2).

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.349
Now, he was very lucky.
 

00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:54.463
It could have been 1 over
r to the 2.110 or 1.96,

00:41:54.463 --> 00:41:58.280
but it happens to be exactly 1
over r^(2).

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.844
Anyway, that's how we can find
even if it's not 1 over

00:42:00.844 --> 00:42:01.570
r^(2).
 

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:04.668
If it's 1 over r^(3),
or 1 over r^(4),

00:42:04.668 --> 00:42:07.829
whatever it is you can find by
taking two charges.

00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:09.822
See, we don't have to know what
q_1 and

00:42:09.822 --> 00:42:10.800
q_2 are.
 

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.599
That's what I'm trying to
emphasize here.

00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:15.090
If all you're trying to see is
does it vary like 1 over

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:17.119
r^(2),
keep everything the same except

00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:17.719
r.
 

00:42:17.719 --> 00:42:20.400
Double the r and see
what happens.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.989
And best way is what you said.
 

00:42:21.989 --> 00:42:25.460
Watch the acceleration,
and if it falls to one fourth

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.864
of the value for doubling the
distance, it is 1 over

00:42:28.864 --> 00:42:30.000
r^(2).
 

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.869
All right, suppose I got 1 over
r^(2).

00:42:32.869 --> 00:42:35.565
I want to know it depends on
the charges as the first power

00:42:35.565 --> 00:42:37.657
of q_1 and the
first power of

00:42:37.657 --> 00:42:38.820
q_2.
 

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.900
So how should we do that?
 

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.210
And don't say put 10 electrons
once and then 20 electrons

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:47.869
because you cannot see electrons
that well.

00:42:47.869 --> 00:42:52.143
In the old days people did not
even know about electrons,

00:42:52.143 --> 00:42:54.889
and yet they managed to test
this.

00:42:54.889 --> 00:42:58.510
So how will you vary the charge
in a known way?

00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:59.300
Yep?
 

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.460
Student:  You could have
many identical spheres,

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.260
and maybe keep touching them to
each other.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.460
Prof: Ah!
 

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.599
Okay, many identical spheres.
 

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:10.438
Student:  And then put
charge on one and then touch it

00:43:10.438 --> 00:43:12.710
to the second one and you'll get
half as much.

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:13.699
Prof: Very good.
 

00:43:13.699 --> 00:43:15.469
Let me repeat what she said.
 

00:43:15.469 --> 00:43:17.340
First you take many identical
spheres.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.704
Well, I not going to even try
to draw identical spheres

00:43:20.704 --> 00:43:23.760
because I haven't learned how to
draw spheres,

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.000
but let's imagine you've got a
whole bunch of these guys.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.150
You put some charge on this.
 

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:32.010
You don't know what it is, okay?
 

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:32.969
We don't know what q is.
 

00:43:32.969 --> 00:43:34.320
We're trying to find out.
 

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.559
You don't have to know what
q is.

00:43:35.559 --> 00:43:37.789
So let this be one of the
objects.

00:43:37.789 --> 00:43:39.570
That's my q.
 

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:43.173
For the other object,
keep a fixed-object containing

00:43:43.173 --> 00:43:44.730
some other q.
 

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:45.789
This has got charge q.
 

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:47.579
Don't vary the r.
 

00:43:47.579 --> 00:43:50.260
Question is,
can you change q to

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.329
q/2,
and her answer was:

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:55.090
if it's got some charge,
maybe a plus,

00:43:55.090 --> 00:44:00.409
bring it in contact with the
second identical sphere.

00:44:00.409 --> 00:44:04.146
If it really is identical,
you have to agree that when you

00:44:04.146 --> 00:44:07.360
separate them they must exactly
have half each.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.780
That's a symmetry argument.
 

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.188
Because for any reason you give
me for why one of them should

00:44:11.188 --> 00:44:13.760
have more, I will tell you why
the other one should have more.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.141
You cannot, so they will split
it evenly and therefore charge

00:44:18.141 --> 00:44:22.449
will split evenly to q/2
here and q/2 here.

00:44:22.449 --> 00:44:27.010
Then you can take this and put
it there--you've got q/2.

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:29.980
Then you can do other
combinations.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.273
For example,
you can take this q/2

00:44:33.273 --> 00:44:37.639
and connect it to the ground so
it becomes neutral.

00:44:37.639 --> 00:44:39.518
So this has got 0 again.
 

00:44:39.518 --> 00:44:42.920
You can touch that with the
q/2 and separate them.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:47.469
Then each will have q/4.
 

00:44:47.469 --> 00:44:50.387
So in this way you can vary the
charge in a known way,

00:44:50.387 --> 00:44:52.039
maybe half of it,
double it.

00:44:52.039 --> 00:44:55.240
I give you some homework
problem where you want to get

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.449
5/16 of a coulomb.
 

00:44:56.449 --> 00:44:58.789
By enough spheres you can do
that.

00:44:58.789 --> 00:45:02.541
Again, what I want you to
notice is that you did not know

00:45:02.541 --> 00:45:04.996
what q was,
but all you knew is that

00:45:04.996 --> 00:45:07.481
q went to q/2 when
you brought two identical

00:45:07.481 --> 00:45:08.789
spheres and separated them.
 

00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:10.818
That's how we can find that it
depends linearly on

00:45:10.818 --> 00:45:11.768
q_1.
 

00:45:11.768 --> 00:45:14.375
Of course, it also depends
linearly on q_2

00:45:14.375 --> 00:45:16.710
because it's up to you to decide
who you want to call

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.617
q_1,
and who you want to call

00:45:19.617 --> 00:45:21.210
q_2.
 

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:27.721
Okay, so I want you people to
understand all the time that you

00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:33.059
should be able to tell me how
you measure anything,

00:45:33.059 --> 00:45:34.019
okay?
 

00:45:34.019 --> 00:45:35.349
That's very, very important.
 

00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:36.389
That's why you should think
about it.

00:45:36.389 --> 00:45:39.664
If you think in those terms
you'll also find you're doing

00:45:39.664 --> 00:45:41.360
all the problems very well.
 

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.994
If you're thinking of pushing
symbols and canceling factors of

00:45:43.994 --> 00:45:46.630
Π you won't get the
feeling for what's happening.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:50.639
So everything you write down
you should be able to measure.

00:45:50.639 --> 00:45:52.244
If you say, "Oh,
I want to measure the

00:45:52.244 --> 00:45:54.539
force," you've got to be
sure how you'll measure it,

00:45:54.539 --> 00:45:57.440
and one way is like you said,
find m times a.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.480
If you knew the m you
can measure the force.

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.710
For everything make sure you
can measure it.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:05.733
If I give you a sphere charged
with something,

00:46:05.733 --> 00:46:08.219
then of course we've got to
decide.

00:46:08.219 --> 00:46:09.440
Suppose I give you a sphere.
 

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:12.224
It's got some charge,
and I want you to find how much

00:46:12.224 --> 00:46:13.670
charge is on that sphere.
 

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:16.000
This time I want you to tell me
how many coulombs there are.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.840
What will you do?
 

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:27.719
What process will you use?
 

00:46:27.719 --> 00:46:31.806
Well, then you have a problem
because you are not able to

00:46:31.806 --> 00:46:34.547
figure out,
but if I tell you here's an

00:46:34.547 --> 00:46:36.152
object,
it is 3 meters long,

00:46:36.152 --> 00:46:39.144
you can test it because you'll
go and bring the meter stick

00:46:39.144 --> 00:46:42.190
from the Bureau of Standards and
measure it three times.

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:46.632
I'm asking you,
if I give you a certain charge

00:46:46.632 --> 00:46:52.063
and say how much charge is
there, by what process can we

00:46:52.063 --> 00:46:54.630
calibrate the charges?
 

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:55.690
Yep?
 

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:57.402
Student:  Put it in the
vicinity of a reference charge

00:46:57.402 --> 00:46:58.429
and then measure the
acceleration.

00:46:58.429 --> 00:47:01.159
Prof: That's correct.
 

00:47:01.159 --> 00:47:04.862
If you knew one standard
charge, somehow or other we knew

00:47:04.862 --> 00:47:08.036
its value, then bring the
unknown one next to it,

00:47:08.036 --> 00:47:10.550
put it at a known distance,
right?

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:11.179
You know the r.
 

00:47:11.179 --> 00:47:12.059
You know the 4Π.
 

00:47:12.059 --> 00:47:13.409
You know the ε
_0.

00:47:13.409 --> 00:47:15.440
You find the force,
you can find this charge.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:19.210
So all we need to know is how
to get a reference charge,

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:19.760
right?
 

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:24.590
So how do I know something has
a coulomb?

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:28.880
How do I get 1 coulomb of
charge just to be sure?

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.764
You know what you could do,
because you haven't defined yet

00:47:31.764 --> 00:47:34.054
the reference,
so you should think about how

00:47:34.054 --> 00:47:38.449
will I get a coulomb charge,
or any other charge?

00:47:38.449 --> 00:47:41.702
So I could take these two
spheres that she talked about,

00:47:41.702 --> 00:47:43.889
each with the same charge
q.

00:47:43.889 --> 00:47:45.340
We don't know what it is.
 

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.432
I put them at 1 meter distance
and I measure the force,

00:47:48.432 --> 00:47:51.697
namely how hard should I hold
one from running away to the

00:47:51.697 --> 00:47:52.500
other one.
 

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.751
Once I got the force,
the only thing unknown in the

00:47:54.751 --> 00:47:56.329
equation is q times
q.

00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:57.230
I know r.
 

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:59.922
I know 1 over 4Πε
_0.

00:47:59.922 --> 00:48:00.949
I can get q.
 

00:48:00.949 --> 00:48:03.530
So every time you write
something think about how you'll

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:06.251
measure it, because in that
process you're learning how the

00:48:06.251 --> 00:48:07.190
physics is done.
 

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:09.909
If you try to avoid that you'll
be just juggling equations,

00:48:09.909 --> 00:48:12.768
and that doesn't work for you
and that doesn't work for me.

00:48:12.768 --> 00:48:15.592
Anybody who wants to do good
physics should be constantly

00:48:15.592 --> 00:48:17.710
paying attention to physical
phenomena,

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:22.010
and not to the symbols that
stand for physical objects.

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:27.454
All right, so the final thing I
want to do in this connection is

00:48:27.454 --> 00:48:32.757
to give this number I mentioned,
F_gravity over

00:48:32.757 --> 00:48:34.889
F_electric.
 

00:48:34.889 --> 00:48:38.619
I said gravity is 10 to the -40
times weaker.

00:48:38.619 --> 00:48:41.889
Well, you have to precise on
how you got the number.

00:48:41.889 --> 00:48:45.438
See, it's not like selling
toothpaste where you can say it

00:48:45.438 --> 00:48:46.809
is 7.2 times whiter.
 

00:48:46.809 --> 00:48:49.856
I don't know how those guys
measure whiteness in a unit with

00:48:49.856 --> 00:48:52.440
two decimal places,
but that's a different game.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:56.529
It's not subject to any rules,
but here you have to say how

00:48:56.529 --> 00:48:58.010
you got the number.
 

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:01.400
In what context did you make
the comparison?

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.590
It turns out the answer does
depend on what you choose.

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:08.708
There'll be some variations,
but those tiny variations are

00:49:08.708 --> 00:49:11.960
swamped by this enormous ratio I
would get.

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.623
So what you could do is take
any two bodies,

00:49:14.623 --> 00:49:17.719
and find the ratio of gravity
to electric force.

00:49:17.719 --> 00:49:21.134
One option is to take two
elementary particles,

00:49:21.134 --> 00:49:22.989
whichever two you like.
 

00:49:22.989 --> 00:49:25.626
So I will take an electron and
a proton, but you can take an

00:49:25.626 --> 00:49:27.949
electron and a positron,
or a proton and a proton.

00:49:27.949 --> 00:49:29.690
It doesn't matter.
 

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:35.309
These two guys attract each
other gravitationally and

00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:36.929
electrically.
 

00:49:36.929 --> 00:49:39.400
So I will write the force of
gravitation,

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.320
which is G, mass of the
proton,

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.050
mass of the electron,
over r^(2 )divided by

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:51.043
q_electron,
q_proton over

00:49:51.043 --> 00:49:55.255
4Πε
_0 times 1

00:49:55.255 --> 00:49:57.099
over r^(2).
 

00:49:57.099 --> 00:49:59.010
Notice in this experiment,
in this calculation,

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:03.692
r^(2 )does not matter,
so you don't have to decide how

00:50:03.692 --> 00:50:06.083
far you want to keep them,
because they both go like 1

00:50:06.083 --> 00:50:08.630
over r^(2 ),so you can
pick any r.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:14.188
So whatever you pick is going
to cancel and you will be left

00:50:14.188 --> 00:50:15.980
with this number.
 

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:19.846
A q_1,
q_2 and the 1

00:50:19.846 --> 00:50:22.326
over
4Πε_0

00:50:22.326 --> 00:50:25.389
is 9 times 10 to the
9^(th).

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:27.659
So now we put in some numbers.
 

00:50:27.659 --> 00:50:31.146
So G is 10 to the -11
with some pre-factors,

00:50:31.146 --> 00:50:32.750
maybe 6 in this case.
 

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.940
I'm not going to worry about
pre-factors.

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:38.994
But the mass of the proton is
10 to the -27 kilograms,

00:50:38.994 --> 00:50:42.590
the mass of the electron 10 to
-30 kilograms.

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:45.250
So don't say how come they all
have these nice round numbers.

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:45.949
They are not.
 

00:50:45.949 --> 00:50:47.739
There are factors like 1 and 2.
 

00:50:47.739 --> 00:50:51.329
I'm not putting them because
I'm just counting powers of 10.

00:50:51.329 --> 00:50:56.393
q_1 is 1.6
times 10 to the -19,

00:50:56.393 --> 00:51:01.349
so two of those q's is
10 to the -38.

00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:06.059
Then 9 times 10 to the 9^(th)
is roughly 10 to the 10^(th).

00:51:06.059 --> 00:51:10.865
If you do all of that you will
find this is 10 to the -40,

00:51:10.865 --> 00:51:14.661
if it is some typical situation
that you took,

00:51:14.661 --> 00:51:17.949
and you found this ratio of
forces.

00:51:17.949 --> 00:51:19.429
If there are two elementary
particles,

00:51:19.429 --> 00:51:22.250
which are like the building
blocks of matter,

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.934
and you brought them to any
distance you like you compare

00:51:25.934 --> 00:51:29.750
the electric attraction to the
gravitational attraction.

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:33.817
So one question is:
if gravity is so weak,

00:51:33.817 --> 00:51:38.480
how did anyone discover the
force of gravity?

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.179
If all you had was electrons
and protons, you'd have to

00:51:41.179 --> 00:51:42.829
measure the force between them.
 

00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:46.402
Suppose you knew only about
electricity, didn't know about

00:51:46.402 --> 00:51:47.280
gravitation.
 

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.711
One way to find there is an
extra force is to measure the

00:51:51.711 --> 00:51:55.670
force to an accuracy good to 40
decimal places,

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:58.389
and in the 40th decimal place
you find something is wrong.

00:51:58.389 --> 00:52:00.938
You fiddle around and figure
out the correction comes from

00:52:00.938 --> 00:52:03.400
m_1m_2
over r^(2),

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.389
but that's not how it was done,
right?

00:52:05.389 --> 00:52:07.300
You guys know that.
 

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:10.427
So how did anyone discover the
force of gravity when it's

00:52:10.427 --> 00:52:11.210
overwhelmed?
 

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:12.039
Yes?
 

00:52:12.039 --> 00:52:13.030
Student:  Most things
are neutral?

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:14.079
Prof: Yes.
 

00:52:14.079 --> 00:52:17.360
Most things are electrically
neutral.

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.143
In other words,
electric force,

00:52:20.143 --> 00:52:25.710
even though it's very strong,
comes with opposite charges.

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:29.730
It can occur with a plus sign
or with a minus sign.

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:32.971
Therefore, if you take the
planet Earth,

00:52:32.971 --> 00:52:36.876
it's got lots and lots of
charges in every atom,

00:52:36.876 --> 00:52:39.369
but every atom is neutral.
 

00:52:39.369 --> 00:52:43.922
You've got the moon,
ditto, lots and lots of atoms,

00:52:43.922 --> 00:52:46.289
but they're all neutral.
 

00:52:46.289 --> 00:52:50.557
But the mass of the electron
does not cancel the mass of the

00:52:50.557 --> 00:52:51.210
proton.
 

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:55.730
So mass can never be hidden,
whereas charge can be hidden.

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:57.429
Mass never cancels.
 

00:52:57.429 --> 00:53:00.438
That's the reason why,
in spite of the incredible

00:53:00.438 --> 00:53:04.012
amount of electrical forces
they're potentially capable of

00:53:04.012 --> 00:53:07.063
exerting,
they present to each other

00:53:07.063 --> 00:53:08.570
neutral entities.
 

00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:12.585
Therefore, this remaining force
which is not shielded is what

00:53:12.585 --> 00:53:16.264
you see, and has a dramatic role
in the structure of the

00:53:16.264 --> 00:53:18.340
universe, force of gravity.
 

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.889
But in most cosmological
calculations you can forget

00:53:20.889 --> 00:53:22.289
mainly the electric force.
 

00:53:22.289 --> 00:53:23.849
It's all gravitational force.
 

00:53:23.849 --> 00:53:27.309
That's because electricity can
be neutralized.

00:53:27.309 --> 00:53:29.769
So you cannot hide gravity.
 

00:53:29.769 --> 00:53:31.099
Everything has mass.
 

00:53:31.099 --> 00:53:33.039
Even photons which have no mass
have energy.

00:53:33.039 --> 00:53:35.980
They're also attracted by
gravitation.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:42.420
So gravity cannot be hidden,
and that's the origin of

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:46.260
something called dark matter.
 

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:50.550
So how many of you guys heard
about dark matter?

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:51.320
Okay?
 

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.079
Anyone want to volunteer?
 

00:53:53.079 --> 00:53:58.436
Someone whose name begins with
T, anybody's name begins with T

00:53:58.436 --> 00:54:01.599
and also knows the answer to
this?

00:54:01.599 --> 00:54:04.855
The trouble is,
you people are plagued with one

00:54:04.855 --> 00:54:08.110
quality which is not good for
being in physics,

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:09.880
namely you're modest.
 

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:11.530
So you don't want to tell me
the answer.

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:15.849
So I have to give an excuse for
whoever gives the answer.

00:54:15.849 --> 00:54:24.809
If your seat has a number 142,
anybody in seat 142?

00:54:24.809 --> 00:54:27.880
Maybe they're not even numbered.
 

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:32.494
Look, anybody with a red piece
of clothing knows the answer to

00:54:32.494 --> 00:54:33.780
this--go ahead.
 

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.070
Yes?
 

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:37.480
Student: 
&gt;

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.260
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:47.360
Student: 
&gt;

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:47.909
Prof: Right.
 

00:54:47.909 --> 00:54:51.885
Basically there's no way you
can see it, and there's dark

00:54:51.885 --> 00:54:54.300
matter right in this room,
okay?

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:58.273
And there's dark matter
everywhere, but the reason,

00:54:58.273 --> 00:55:01.849
the way people found out there
is dark matter,

00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:05.030
do you know how that was
determined?

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:06.130
Yep?
 

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:09.266
Student:  The rotation
of galaxies didn't line up with

00:55:09.266 --> 00:55:11.150
the matter that was visible,
so...

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:12.369
Prof: So yes.
 

00:55:12.369 --> 00:55:16.210
Maybe one example I can talk is
about our own galaxy.

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:22.699
So here's our visible galaxy,
okay, the old spiral.

00:55:22.699 --> 00:55:27.306
Now, if something is orbiting
this galaxy just by using

00:55:27.306 --> 00:55:30.773
Newtonian gravity,
by knowing the velocity of the

00:55:30.773 --> 00:55:34.905
object as it goes around,
you can calculate how much mass

00:55:34.905 --> 00:55:37.110
is enclosed by the orbit.
 

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:39.849
That's a property of
gravitation--from the orbit,

00:55:39.849 --> 00:55:42.420
you can find out how much mass
is enclosed.

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:45.418
So what you will find is,
if you found something orbiting

00:55:45.418 --> 00:55:48.577
the center of the galaxy at that
radius, you'll enclose some

00:55:48.577 --> 00:55:49.059
mass.
 

00:55:49.059 --> 00:55:51.617
If you take objects at bigger
and bigger radius,

00:55:51.617 --> 00:55:54.771
you'll enclose more and more
mass, until you find orbits as

00:55:54.771 --> 00:55:55.969
big as the galaxy.
 

00:55:55.969 --> 00:56:00.498
Then the mass enclosed as a
function of radius should come

00:56:00.498 --> 00:56:04.869
and stop, because after that the
orbit's getting bigger,

00:56:04.869 --> 00:56:07.730
but not enclosing any more
mass.

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:11.418
But what people found,
that even after you cross the

00:56:11.418 --> 00:56:16.250
nominal size of the galaxy,
you still keep picking up mass,

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:20.369
and that is the dark matter
halo of our galaxy.

00:56:20.369 --> 00:56:23.769
So it's dark to everything,
but you cannot escape gravity.

00:56:23.769 --> 00:56:24.860
That's what I meant to say.
 

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:27.820
You cannot avoid gravitational
force.

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.550
So people are trying to find
dark matter.

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:33.570
People at Yale are trying to
find dark matter.

00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:36.364
The thing is,
you don't know exactly what it

00:56:36.364 --> 00:56:36.690
is.
 

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:39.538
It's not any of the usual
suspects, because then they

00:56:39.538 --> 00:56:41.619
would have interacted very
strongly.

00:56:41.619 --> 00:56:44.438
So you're trying to find
something not knowing exactly

00:56:44.438 --> 00:56:45.130
what it is.
 

00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:47.708
And you've got to build
detectors that will detect

00:56:47.708 --> 00:56:48.340
something.
 

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:50.969
And you go through it everyday
in your lab,

00:56:50.969 --> 00:56:54.617
and you're hoping that one of
these dark matter particles will

00:56:54.617 --> 00:56:57.190
collide with the stuff in your
detector,

00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:59.750
and trigger a reaction.
 

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:02.610
Of course there will be lots of
reactions everyday,

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:05.070
but most of them are due to
other things.

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:06.059
That's called background.
 

00:57:06.059 --> 00:57:08.423
You've got to throw the
background out,

00:57:08.423 --> 00:57:11.909
and whatever is left has got to
be due to dark matter.

00:57:11.909 --> 00:57:15.130
And again, how do you know it's
dark matter?

00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:17.260
How do you know it's not
something else?

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.731
Well you can see that if you're
drifting through dark matter in

00:57:20.731 --> 00:57:23.275
a moving Earth,
you will be running into more

00:57:23.275 --> 00:57:26.188
of them in the direction of
motion and less in the other

00:57:26.188 --> 00:57:28.572
direction,
because you're running into the

00:57:28.572 --> 00:57:28.889
wind.
 

00:57:28.889 --> 00:57:32.007
So by looking at the direction
dependence, you can try to see

00:57:32.007 --> 00:57:33.150
if it's dark matter.
 

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:37.760
Anyway, dark matter was
discovered by simple Newtonian

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.980
gravitation.
 

00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:42.074
The particles that form dark
matter are very interesting to

00:57:42.074 --> 00:57:43.250
particle physicists.
 

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:46.655
There are many candidates in
particle theory,

00:57:46.655 --> 00:57:50.757
but the origin of the
discrepancy came from just doing

00:57:50.757 --> 00:57:52.460
Newtonian gravity.
 

00:57:52.460 --> 00:58:04.817
All right, the final thing
today before we break is that

00:58:04.817 --> 00:58:14.030
there's one variation of
Coulomb's Law.

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:18.320
By the way, I do not know your
mathematical training and how

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:21.070
much math you know,
so you have to be on the

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:22.835
lookout, say,
if I write something that looks

00:58:22.835 --> 00:58:25.523
very alien to you,
you've got to go take care of

00:58:25.523 --> 00:58:27.105
that,
in particular,

00:58:27.105 --> 00:58:31.329
how to do integrals in maybe
more than one dimension.

00:58:31.329 --> 00:58:34.567
Anyway, what I wanted to
discuss today is the following:

00:58:34.567 --> 00:58:37.922
we know how to do Coulomb's Law
due to any number of point

00:58:37.922 --> 00:58:38.630
charges.
 

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:41.563
So if you put another charge
q here you want the force

00:58:41.563 --> 00:58:43.079
on this guy due to all these.
 

00:58:43.079 --> 00:58:45.360
You draw those lines,
you take the 1 over r^(2

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:47.404
)due to that,
1 over r^(2 )due to

00:58:47.404 --> 00:58:48.829
that, add all the vectors.
 

00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:50.150
That's very simple.
 

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:54.150
But we will also take problems
where the charges are

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:55.170
continuous.
 

00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:57.159
So here's an example.
 

00:58:57.159 --> 00:59:01.059
Here's a ring of charge.
 

00:59:01.059 --> 00:59:02.150
The ring has some radius.
 

00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:06.943
You pick your radius r,
and the charge on it is

00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:08.119
continuous.
 

00:59:08.119 --> 00:59:10.650
It's not discrete,
or it could be in real life

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:13.460
everything is discrete,
but to a coarse observer it

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:15.429
will look like it's continuous.
 

00:59:15.429 --> 00:59:20.686
So we can draw some pictures
here, charges all over the ring,

00:59:20.686 --> 00:59:25.768
and λ is the
number of coulombs per meter.

00:59:25.768 --> 00:59:29.503
Let me see, if you snipped one
meter of the wire it'll have

00:59:29.503 --> 00:59:31.630
λ coulombs in it.
 

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:36.195
And you want to find the
electric force on some other

00:59:36.195 --> 00:59:39.269
charge q due to this
wire.

00:59:39.269 --> 00:59:40.840
So you cannot do a sum.
 

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.280
And you have to do an integral.
 

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:45.159
That's what I'm driving at,
and I'm going to do one

00:59:45.159 --> 00:59:48.268
integral, then we'll do more
complicated ones later.

00:59:48.268 --> 00:59:52.150
So I want to find the force on
a charge q here.

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:56.771
So what I will do is,
I will divide this into

00:59:56.771 --> 01:00:01.079
segments each of length,
say dl.

01:00:01.079 --> 01:00:06.851
Then I will find the force of
the charge here,

01:00:06.851 --> 01:00:08.389
dF.
 

01:00:08.389 --> 01:00:13.780
I will add the forces due to
all the segments.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.639
The force of this segment will
be the charge--

01:00:16.639 --> 01:00:19.860
this segment is so small,
you can treat it as a point

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.807
charge,
and the amount of charge here

01:00:22.807 --> 01:00:25.699
is λ times
dl.

01:00:25.699 --> 01:00:27.659
That's the q_1.
 

01:00:27.659 --> 01:00:30.510
The q_2 is the
q I put there.

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:31.610
Then there's the
4Πε

01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:33.719
_0,
r^(2),

01:00:33.719 --> 01:00:38.652
r^(2 )will be this
distance z times this

01:00:38.652 --> 01:00:41.987
radius r will be--
maybe I shouldn't call it

01:00:41.987 --> 01:00:42.280
r.
 

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.909
Let me call it capital
R, and it's R^(2

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:47.800
)plus z^(2).
 

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.530
That's the distance.
 

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:54.311
But now that force is a vector
that's pointing in that

01:00:54.311 --> 01:00:57.322
direction,
but I know that the total force

01:00:57.322 --> 01:01:01.088
is going to point in this
direction because for every guy

01:01:01.088 --> 01:01:05.052
I find in this side I can find
one in the opposite direction

01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:06.599
pointing that way.
 

01:01:06.599 --> 01:01:08.840
So they will always cancel
horizontally.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:13.039
The only remaining force will
be in the z direction.

01:01:13.039 --> 01:01:16.590
So I'm going to keep only the
component of the force in the z

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:17.300
direction.
 

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.619
I denote it by dF in the
z direction.

01:01:20.619 --> 01:01:25.166
For that, you have to take this
force and multiply by cosine of

01:01:25.166 --> 01:01:26.780
that θ.
 

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:29.291
I hope you know how to find the
component of a force in a

01:01:29.291 --> 01:01:29.829
direction.
 

01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:32.400
It's the cosine of the angle
between them.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.005
That angle is equal to this
angle, and cosine of this is

01:01:37.005 --> 01:01:41.695
z divided by R^(2
)plus z^(2 )on the

01:01:41.695 --> 01:01:42.449
root.
 

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:45.648
That is the dF due to
this segment,

01:01:45.648 --> 01:01:50.175
and the total force in the z
direction is integral of this,

01:01:50.175 --> 01:01:52.360
and what that integrate.
 

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.215
λ,
q, all these are

01:01:54.215 --> 01:01:56.311
constant, R,
z, everything is a

01:01:56.311 --> 01:01:56.929
constant.
 

01:01:56.929 --> 01:02:01.298
You have to add all the
dl's, if you add all the

01:02:01.298 --> 01:02:04.940
dl's you will get the
circumference.

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:07.722
In other words,
this is going to be

01:02:07.722 --> 01:02:11.980
λqz divided
by 4Πε

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.809
_0R^(2
)plus z^(2 )to the

01:02:16.809 --> 01:02:19.429
3/2 integral of dl.
 

01:02:19.429 --> 01:02:25.340
Integral of dl is just
2ΠR.

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.213
In other words,
every one of them is making an

01:02:27.213 --> 01:02:29.306
equal contribution,
so the integrand doesn't depend

01:02:29.306 --> 01:02:32.195
on where you are in the circle,
so you're just measuring the

01:02:32.195 --> 01:02:33.480
length of the circle.
 

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.659
That's the answer.
 

01:02:34.659 --> 01:02:38.192
The force looks like
λ times

01:02:38.192 --> 01:02:41.380
2ΠR,
what is that?

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:44.179
λ is the charge
per unit length.

01:02:44.179 --> 01:02:47.719
That, times the length of the
loop, is the charge on the loop.

01:02:47.719 --> 01:02:51.614
It's the charge you're putting
there divided by

01:02:51.614 --> 01:02:55.679
4Πε
_0 divided

01:02:55.679 --> 01:02:59.829
by R^(2) plus
z^(2) to the 3/2.

01:02:59.829 --> 01:03:04.891
That's an example of
calculating the force which will

01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:07.130
be in this direction.
 

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:10.644
Now, once you've done this
calculation you may think maybe

01:03:10.644 --> 01:03:13.976
I missed a factor of Π
or factor of e,

01:03:13.976 --> 01:03:14.840
something.
 

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:19.559
Can you think of a way to test
this?

01:03:19.559 --> 01:03:22.940
What test would you like to
apply to this result?

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:24.018
Yep?
 

01:03:24.018 --> 01:03:27.273
Student:  Put the
z equal to 0 and have it

01:03:27.273 --> 01:03:28.219
in the middle.
 

01:03:28.219 --> 01:03:29.579
There should be no forces on it.
 

01:03:29.579 --> 01:03:30.510
Prof: Very good.
 

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:33.163
What he said is,
if you pick z equal to 0

01:03:33.163 --> 01:03:35.760
you're sitting in the middle of
the circle,

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.000
and you're getting pushed
equally from all sides,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.239
and you better not have a
force, and that's certainly

01:03:40.239 --> 01:03:40.670
correct.
 

01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:43.789
This vanishes when z
goes to 0.

01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:47.469
Anything else?
 

01:03:47.469 --> 01:03:57.079
Any other test?
 

01:03:57.079 --> 01:03:58.099
Yep?
 

01:03:58.099 --> 01:03:59.965
Student:  You could put
it underneath by negative

01:03:59.965 --> 01:04:00.340
z.
 

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.570
The force should be negative.
 

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:07.253
Prof: Yes,
it will point down and be

01:04:07.253 --> 01:04:08.219
negative.
 

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:12.114
That's correct,
but how about the magnitude of

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:16.530
the force itself,
rather than just the direction?

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:17.469
Yep?
 

01:04:17.469 --> 01:04:19.864
Student:  If you go
infinitely far away it should

01:04:19.864 --> 01:04:21.039
look like a point charge.
 

01:04:21.039 --> 01:04:22.480
Prof: Yes.
 

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.704
If you go very,
very far, someone's holding a

01:04:24.704 --> 01:04:26.980
loop, you cannot see that it's
even a loop.

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:29.688
It's some tiny spec,
and it should produce the

01:04:29.688 --> 01:04:30.170
field.
 

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:31.929
So what field should it produce?
 

01:04:31.929 --> 01:04:34.630
It should produce the coulomb
force q_1q

01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:36.670
_2,
or 4Πε

01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:39.070
_0 times
distance squared.

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:41.737
And when z is much,
much, much bigger than

01:04:41.737 --> 01:04:44.739
R, this is one kilometer,
this is two inches.

01:04:44.739 --> 01:04:46.409
You forget this.
 

01:04:46.409 --> 01:04:50.449
You get z^(2) to the 3/2
is then z cubed.

01:04:50.449 --> 01:04:54.682
That means the whole thing here
reduces to 1 over z^(2)

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:58.570
and it looks like the force
between two point charges.

01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:03.456
So I would ask you whenever you
do a calculation to test your

01:05:03.456 --> 01:05:04.190
result.
 

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:07.876
Okay, before going I've got to
tell you something about those

01:05:07.876 --> 01:05:08.860
who come late.
 

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:11.846
I realize that you guys come
from near and far,

01:05:11.846 --> 01:05:15.351
so when you come late let me
give you my preference for

01:05:15.351 --> 01:05:16.389
doors, okay?
 

01:05:16.389 --> 01:05:18.650
Door number one is that one.
 

01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:21.239
That's the least problematic.
 

01:05:21.239 --> 01:05:24.998
Door number two is this one,
because in the beginning of the

01:05:24.998 --> 01:05:27.865
lecture I'm usually on that side
of the board,

01:05:27.865 --> 01:05:29.650
so you guys can come in.
 

01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:33.315
Door number three is that one
where Jude is taking the

01:05:33.315 --> 01:05:36.842
picture, but do not stand in
front of the camera and

01:05:36.842 --> 01:05:38.780
contemplate your future.
 

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:42.235
If you do I will make sure you
don't have a future,

01:05:42.235 --> 01:05:42.719
okay?
 

01:05:42.719 --> 01:05:43.780
So don't do that.
 

01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:48.094
If you come fashionably late,
never come through that door,

01:05:48.094 --> 01:05:49.360
maybe this one.
 

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.697
In fact if you come through
that door because I have reached

01:05:52.697 --> 01:05:54.900
this side of the board,
you are very,

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.820
very late, so I think you
should take the day off and

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.920
start fresh next time,
all right?

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.500
Okay, thank you.
 

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:07.000

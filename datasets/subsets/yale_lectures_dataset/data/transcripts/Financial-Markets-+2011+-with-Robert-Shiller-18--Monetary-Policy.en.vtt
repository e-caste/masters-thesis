PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Today's lecture

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.840
is on central banks.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.870
We already had a lecture, a few
lectures ago, about banks,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.530
so what are central banks?

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.650
Well, today they're very special
government banks that

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.800
are responsible for the
currency, the money.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.030
And so, every country in the
world has a paper money that

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.060
has the name of their
central bank on it.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.720
But I wanted to take the --

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.080
as you know, I like
to understand

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.230
origins of things --

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.640
I wanted to take it back to
the beginnings of central

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.560
banking, so we'll understand
better what

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.070
the institution is.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.420
I wanted to bring up first the
theme of this course, which is

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.030
that financial innovation or
invention is an important

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.430
process that is not unlike
engineering invention.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.560
When somebody gets an idea, and
it's proven to work, it

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.730
gets copied all over
the world.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.800
That's the way the
human species is.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.120
We all have the same kind of
cars, we all have the same

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.340
kind of airplanes.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.060
Why?

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.840
Not because we're copycats,
but because someone has

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.430
figured out something that
works, and of course,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.900
everyone copies it.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.490
And I think the same thing is
true with central banks.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.060
So, I wanted to get to the
history of central banks and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.470
to go back first to the
first central bank.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.910
Then, I'll bring it all the way
up to the modern times,

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.830
where the recent financial
crisis --

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.199
the actions during the crisis,
the actions of the world's

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:47.930
central banks was extremely
important in preventing what

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.430
might have been another
Great Depression.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.480
So, these institutions have
become of fundamental

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.240
importance.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.910
Remember the story I told you in
our banking lecture, about

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.130
how banks got started in the
U.K. They'd already been seen

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.800
earlier in other places, but
the really modern banking

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.040
institution is traced to
the goldsmith bankers.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.400
So, people used to --

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.410
there were goldsmiths who made
gold jewelry, and people found

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.100
that, since they had a safe or
they had a way of protecting

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.590
things, they would leave their
gold on deposit at the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.050
goldsmith banker.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.320
And the goldsmith banker would
give you a little piece of

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.820
paper, indicating that you
could, at any time, come back

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.250
to the goldsmith and claim
this amount of gold.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.410
And then, the pieces of paper
started circulating as paper

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.830
money, and that's how it all
started -- unregulated,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.120
nothing to do with
the government.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.250
It was just private
businesses.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.950
And that system, paper
money backed by gold,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.320
lasted until the 1970s.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.770
Amazing.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.820
Well, it wasn't always gold.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.210
It was bimetallic.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.730
There would be gold and silver,
and things -- or all

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.830
silver -- it's a long story, but
we were effectively on the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.110
gold standard until just
a few decades ago.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.230
But there were problems right
from the beginning.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.740
And the problem was, that
sometimes the goldsmith

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.160
bankers wouldn't make
good on their pledge

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.310
to redeem in gold.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.290
You'd come with your piece of
paper, and they'd say, I've

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.480
gotten too many requests.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.340
I don't have any gold anymore.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.860
So, that was the problem.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.320
So, I wanted to start with the
Bank of England, which was

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:49.110
founded in 1694.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.550
And it was just a bank, but it
had a special charter from the

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.740
parliament, from the British
government, that gave it a

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.780
monopoly on joint stock banking,
to start with.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.940
It would be the only bank in
the United Kingdom that was

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.380
allowed to issue shares
and sell shares to a

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.090
large number of people.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.020
There were other banks, but they
were partnerships and had

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.820
only a limited number
of partners, so they

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.640
didn't get as big.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.440
So, the Bank of England became
the dominant bank in the

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.690
United Kingdom.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.300
It started a practice --

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.460
and this is very important,
historically --

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.830
it realized it had a lot of
power, because it was the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.460
gorilla bank and there were
a lot of little banks.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.090
And they realized soon that they
could put any bank they

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.030
wanted out of business, whenever
they felt like it.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.890
How?

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.900
Well, because the Bank of
England was so big, they got a

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.250
lot of notes issued by these
other banks, so anytime they

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.070
wanted to, they could just
present them all for payment,

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.780
and no bank could
withstand that.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.550
They didn't have enough
gold on hand.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.950
So, they could drive any
bank to bankruptcy.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.320
But the Bank of England began
to assume its role as

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.670
essentially a government bank,
without being officially

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.290
government, by using a ''let's
live and let live'' policy

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.080
under one condition: If you are
another bank in the U.K.,

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.140
you have to keep a
deposit with us.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.750
And the Bank of England would
tell you how much.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.220
If you didn't do that, you
could be destroyed.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.940
But that created a stability
to the system, because the

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.350
Bank of England had money to
bail them out whenever --

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.320
you know, they had a deposit
with the Bank of England.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.000
The Bank of England
required that.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.390
And so, whenever a bank got in
trouble, they could always

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.110
take their money out of
the Bank of England.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.550
So, the Bank of England than
would help these banks in

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.750
return for their keeping a
deposit, sometimes even lend

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.030
more money to them.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.910
So, that created a
stable banking

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.150
system over the centuries.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.830
So, that was the model for
all of the central

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.040
banks of the world.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.450
They're all copies of
the Bank of England.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.590
The Bank of England, by the way,
was not an independent --

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.310
it became a government bank.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.360
I don't know the whole history,
but it wasn't really

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.680
independent of the government
until 1997, when the United

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.850
Kingdom made it formally
independent.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.790
But nonetheless, it was a model
for central banking, and

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:27.140
it was observed over
much of the world.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.620
Notably, in the United States
there was a bank called the

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.470
Suffolk Bank.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.230
This is much later.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:44.430
It was founded in 1819
in Boston, and it

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.580
was a private bank.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.540
And on its own, it just decided
to do the same thing

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.400
that the Bank of England did.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.940
It required that all of the
New England banks kept a

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.300
deposit with it.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.970
And it did the same thing,
and it stabilized New

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.100
England from bank runs.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:10.310
The Suffolk System lasted
until 1860.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.420
So, you can see how
central banks are

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.980
inventions of people.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.100
They weren't government
inventions at all.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.030
This Suffolk Bank
just did this.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.970
It became a big and
influential bank.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.590
The United States in the first
half of the 19th century had

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.590
repeated banking crises, and
there were repeated problems

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.220
with the currency.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.230
It used to be that, if you went
to a store and you wanted

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.320
to buy something, they'd say,
let's see your money.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.760
You'd take out all of your
money, you'd lay it down, and

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.710
they'd look at it, and they'd
say, well, this is Boston

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.140
money, this is New Haven money,
this is Hartford money.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.420
And they would pull out a book
called the Bank Note Reporter,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.080
and they'd say, well, our money
dealers are now doing a

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.190
20% discount on Hartford money,
so I'll give you $0.80

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.410
on the dollar for the
Hartford money.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.910
Boston money, we're
down 30% on that.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.190
What a messy system.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.730
I shouldn't mention Boston,
because Boston had a good

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.154
record because of the
Suffolk Bank.

00:08:16.059 --> 00:08:18.520
It was worse in other
states, the further

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.960
you got from Boston.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:26.500
So, the Suffolk Bank became
held up as a model of a

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.770
banking system.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.810
But the U.S. also had two banks,
one called The Bank of

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.690
the United States, which
was founded in --

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.110
I'm forgetting the year,
it's not in my notes.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.730
Anyone tell me?

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.230
When was the Bank of the
United States founded?

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.980
1789, I think.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.950
And we had a Second Bank of the
United States, but they

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.880
weren't really functioning
like the Bank of England.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.230
They were maybe somewhat like
them, but the Banks of the

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.230
United States were not really
central banks, and they were

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.260
not renewed.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.610
They disappeared in 1836.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.440
It's a big movement in
the United States.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.780
Because the United States didn't
want the government

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.950
involved in private business,
they were reluctant to set up

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.650
a central bank for
a long time.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:27.105
In 1863, the U.S. passed the
National Banking Act.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:37.600
Actually, there was a revision
of it in 1864, and they tried

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.460
to get some of the advantages of
these central banks without

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.280
actually founding one.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.100
So, what they did then is, they
said, there's a new kind

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.780
of bank called a national bank,
and the national bank

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.930
would have a name
like the First

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.460
National Bank of New Haven.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.050
Every city created a bank in
1863, which was called the

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.630
''first national bank
of something.''

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:08.180
And the government required that
they keep on deposit with

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.240
the Treasury capital to
back their currency.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.850
So, they were called National
Bank Notes that were issued by

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.460
the banks -- printed by the
government -- but they all

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.430
looked the same, except they
had a different name of the

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.800
different bank on them.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.910
And they had capital
requirements, so the banks had

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.570
to put deposits with
the Treasury

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:32.820
backing their currency.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.880
That was a success.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.460
The United States never
again had a problem

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.710
with its paper money.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.020
There was never a problem
of discounts anymore.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.620
All the national banks would
honor each other's notes at

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.310
par, and so that's when the
United States had a paper

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.990
money for the first time.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:09.550
But it didn't create a system
of stable currency.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.430
There were still banking
crises, but they had a

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.080
different form.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.710
It wasn't a failure
of the bank notes.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:25.140
We fixed the bank note problem
in 1863, but the problem was,

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.910
there were still runs on banks,
and there were still

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:32.700
credit expansions and
contractions, that led

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.480
eventually to people in the
United States thinking, we've

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.320
got to eventually copy the Bank
of England and do the

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.580
same thing here.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.740
There was a terrible banking
crisis in 1893, for example,

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.320
when everybody thought the
banks were going to fail.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.070
Somehow they didn't worry
about the currency.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.450
The National Bank Notes were
thought to be perfectly safe,

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.620
but they thought the banks
weren't safe, and so there was

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:04.260
a crisis, and it led to the
depression of the 1890s.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.640
Then, there was another one in
1907 that was really bad.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:14.680
And so, people wanted to fix
somehow the system, and so,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.630
that led to our current system,
which has been around

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.510
almost 100 years.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.520
And I call it a copy of the Bank
of England, but it might

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.060
not be described that
way by everyone.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.665
It's called the Federal
Reserve System.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:41.670
And that was created by an act
of Congress in 1913, and it

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.270
opened its doors in 1914.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.240
But the U.S. --

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.430
again, we always feel that
we're different.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.980
We have to make it
look different.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.970
We can't just copy the
Bank of England.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.720
We've got to do something
different.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.380
So they said, why don't we
create 12 banks -- that sounds

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.540
more American --

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.000
and have them all over
the country.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.342
And so, we didn't create a
central bank, we have a

00:13:01.342 --> 00:13:06.260
banking system with 12 Federal
Reserve Banks.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.220
But of course, they decided
to have a headquarters in

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:14.390
Washington, DC, called the
Federal Reserve Board, or the

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:19.090
Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:24.640
It's an agency in Washington
that oversees

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.670
the 12 regional banks.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.110
Do you know what region --

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.200
the country is divided up.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.150
What region are we in?

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.060
It's Boston.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.990
This is the Boston region.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.830
So, most of the money in your
pocket is Boston money.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.030
It only says so now on the $1
bills, I think, but you can

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.830
look and see where your money
came from, which of the 12

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.110
banks your currency --

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:58.810
But the Federal Reserve System,
as founded in 1913,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:05.550
required, just like the Bank
of England, that banks have

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.550
deposits --

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:13.860
either currency in their vaults
or deposits with their

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.590
Federal Reserve Bank to back
up their currency.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.850
And once again, if they got into
trouble, they could draw

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.050
on their deposits with
the Federal Reserve.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.570
Or even beyond that, the Federal
Reserve could come to

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.630
their rescue.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.380
They've been good banks, they've
kept their deposits --

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.910
just like under the
Suffolk System --

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.390
they've kept their deposits
with the Federal Reserve.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.750
The Federal Reserve will then
help them a little bit more.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:47.340
And so, it became known as the
lender of last resort.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:15:03.540
And the system also operated
something called the

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:15.186
''discount window.'' Why do
they call it a window?

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.330
You people never go into
a bank anymore, right?

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.320
Or do you go into banks?

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.330
Remember, they used to have a
teller, and the teller would

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.680
be sitting at a table, and there
was a little something.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.200
He's talking to you
through a window.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.090
I guess, they wanted to keep you
separate from the money.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:38.340
So, there was a window, where
a teller would talk to you.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.280
The discount window was a
special window at the Federal

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.920
Reserve Bank for
banks to come.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.110
This is the metaphor, anyway.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.300
I don't know if they ever
had such a window.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.120
And so, the bank that was in
trouble could go to the

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.330
discount window, and has to
bring something, though.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.270
They have to bring some
securities as collateral.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:09.190
And so, the teller behind the
discount window would discount

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.420
the collateral brought by the
bank, and lend money.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.510
It's called a discount window,
because you couldn't just

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.310
borrow money, you had to
bring some asset as

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.650
collateral for the loan.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.890
So, in 1913, when the Federal
Reserve was founded,

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.410
President Wilson --

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.420
who was the president who
signed the bill --

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.290
was almost ecstatic.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.240
I have a quote from that.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.130
I don't remember exactly, but
something like, we have put

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.730
banking crises behind us
forever, and this will lead to

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.760
a system of prosperity and --

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.940
I can't think of all the
nice words he used.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.400
People thought that now that
we have adopted the British

00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.550
system, it ought to be smooth
just like in Britain.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.819
There shouldn't be a
problem anymore.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.890
And so, we still live with
that system today.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.050
I think Wilson was right.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.480
It was a big step forward.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:20.050
Again, it was a copying of
other people's successes.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.620
Nobody knows exactly, how the
banking system works.

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.600
There's a theory of money
in banking, but it

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.350
has worked in practice.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:33.180
So, central bankers start to
become very important in

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.650
modern society, because they are
really the keepers of the

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:41.640
gate of sensible lending.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:46.400
There is a tendency for banking
systems to over-lend.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:54.725
They create booms, and create
a false prosperity for a

00:17:54.725 --> 00:17:58.180
while, and then it crashes, and
we have a banking panic

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.740
and a recession or
a depression.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:10.800
That means, then, that the
banking system has to be the

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.890
source of stability
and good sense.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:18.650
We tend to recruit as central
bankers people, who are moral

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.340
and stable in their lives.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.230
One of our Federal Reserve
chairs, William McChesney

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.370
Martin, summed it up very
nicely: ''The job of the

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.290
central banker is to take away
the punch bowl as soon as the

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:39.760
party gets going.'' It's
like a parent, right?

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.010
You can have one drink, but
we're going to stop.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.320
So, that's what the
central bank --

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.200
The central bank controls the
system through reserve

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.840
requirements.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:19:00.910
That is, by telling the banks,
who are members of the system,

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.840
how much they have to hold in
reserves, which are deposits

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.410
at the central bank
or currency.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.570
If they hold currency in their
vaults, if it's right there,

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.820
then they're OK.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.080
This term, reserve requirement,
actually goes

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.310
back to before the
Federal Reserve.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.020
Because we had state -- in the
United States, we had state

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:27.050
banking regulators that were
already imposing reserve

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.550
requirements.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.750
I haven't tracked down exactly,
when it began, but I

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:35.040
think, probably around 1900 in
the United States, during the

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.290
Progressive Era.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:48.540
There are also capital
requirements.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:57.580
And I'll come back to making a
distinction between the two.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.510
Capital requirements and reserve
requirements, both of

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:04.790
those terms began to flourish
around 1900, even before the

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:10.620
Federal Reserve, with state
banking regulators, who were

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:15.820
requiring both capital and
reserves in the United States.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.400
I don't know the history
of every other country.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:24.070
But after the Federal Reserve
was set up in 1913, it began

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.730
to take over both of these
functions of setting reserve

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.935
requirements and setting
capital requirements.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.850
Let me go a little forward
in history.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.910
The system appeared great.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.200
Now, every country of the
world -- not just the

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.940
U.S. and U.K. --

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.910
virtually every country of the
world had a central bank.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.720
Even communist countries, I
think, had central banks.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:21:00.680
But the system broke
down in 1933.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.980
Well actually, before '33.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:08.160
After 1929, banks
started to fail.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:16.340
And the Federal Reserve could
have bailed out the banks --

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.000
in the United States they
started to fail, not the

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.520
United Kingdom.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:28.705
There was a banking crisis after
1929, and it reached its

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:33.950
peak in 1933.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.970
So just before President
Roosevelt took office, the

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.650
banks were in total disarray.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:45.000
And the first thing Roosevelt
did as president was to shut

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.060
down the entire banking system
of the United States.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.510
It was called a banking
holiday.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.930
Because everyone was running
to the bank, it was a

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.190
catastrophic bank run.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.930
Everyone was failing at once.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:04.200
And it was quite a scary
situation, because nobody

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.240
could get their money.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.210
The banks were all closed,
all of them.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:14.150
And people started to
run out of money.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:15.505
I remember that --

00:22:15.505 --> 00:22:16.580
was it the Harvard Crimson?

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.340
-- it did a poll of its students
asking them, how much

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.730
money do you have
in your pocket?

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:25.770
And it got down to, like,
$0.10 and $0.05.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:27.450
They just spent all
their money.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.190
What do you do?

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.990
I mean, how can you get lunch?

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.540
Well, I assume they
had a cafeteria.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.130
Somehow, you could
still do it.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.450
You couldn't go anywhere and
spend any money, if you didn't

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.180
have it, because it
was all tied up.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:44.470
So, people started exchanging
IOUs, and it was just a mess.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:57.040
So, the Federal Reserve didn't
stop that crisis, but the

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.510
Roosevelt administration did
other things to prevent crises

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:06.730
like this, notably set up the
Federal Deposit Insurance

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:07.920
Corporation.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.270
Now this was a --

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:19.790
deposit insurance had preceded
the FDIC in 1933, but it had

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:20.800
never been a success.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.780
It had been tried in
a number of places.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:28.480
The U.S., I think, set the
example for deposit insurance.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.630
And that began to augment
central banking.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:38.290
The U.S. had not had another
banking crisis since 1933

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:45.110
until 2007, just recently.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.330
Well, I should say, there was
the Savings and Loan Crisis,

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:51.250
but not a big banking crisis.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.610
And that is testimony to, I
think, the importance of

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.780
deposit insurance.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:03.480
But the Federal Reserve began
to see it's role as not so

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.060
much preventing banking crisis
-- that was always in the

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.130
background --

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.210
but as stabilizing
the economy.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.960
And so, the Fed began to think
of itself as preventing the

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.990
recurrence of recessions.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:22.370
So, when the economy was
over-heating, the inflation

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.950
was building up, the Fed would
raise interest rates, and the

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:30.340
higher interest rates would
cool down the economy.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.710
And when the economy got too
soft, when the unemployment

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:40.270
rate went up, the Fed would cut
interest rates, and that

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:46.190
would encourage borrowing,
encourage spending, and boost

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.600
the economy.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.065
Actually, that function
of the Fed goes back

00:24:51.065 --> 00:24:54.680
to even before 1933.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:25:00.060
There's an economist, Charles
Amos Dice, who wrote in the

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:06.860
1920s, that the Federal Reserve
is like the regulator

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.920
on a steam engine.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.660
Do you know anything about
steam engines?

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.120
They have this thing that whirls
around with two little

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.240
weights, and if the steam engine
gets too fast, the

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.390
weights spin out by centrifugal
force, and it cuts

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.260
off the steam, so that it
doesn't overheat, the engine

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:27.210
doesn't get going too fast. And
so Dice said, the Federal

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:31.490
Reserve is an invention,
it's the regulator

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.790
for the whole economy.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:39.610
And I think he was right,
although it's not as accurate

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:44.260
as a regulator on a steam
engine, but it works out

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.240
somewhat well.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.780
I wanted to mention that every
country now has a central

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:53.940
bank, but I just wanted to
mention the European Central

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.615
Bank, because it's quite new.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:07.520
It's quite new, and it's maybe
the biggest central bank now

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.940
in the sense that it --

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.500
well, I shouldn't say that.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:16.050
It might be the biggest central
bank by some standard.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:26.860
There was a treaty signed at
Maastricht in 1992, which led

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.360
to the creation of the European
Union from the

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.130
European Communities, and it
also created a plan for a new

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:42.350
currency called the euro, which
is a European currency.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:50.680
And the euro did not actually
start until 1999, and the

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:58.550
currency, actual currency, was
not issued until 2002.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:05.630
So, that is a relatively
recent invention.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:13.530
The European Central Bank, or
ECB, was founded in 1998 --

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.700
that's before the euro
currency started.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.110
They created a list of countries
that wanted to

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.835
participate in the euro zone.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.990
Not all European Union
countries decided to

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.280
participate in the euro, notably
the United Kingdom had

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.170
a referendum and voted
against it.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:40.450
And to this day, they are
not members of the euro.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:41.370
Also
[addition: as of April 2011]

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.670
Sweden, Lithuania, Latvia,
Estonia, Poland, Czech

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:49.290
Republic, Hungary, Romania,
Bulgaria, and Malta are not in

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:49.826
the euro zone.

00:27:49.826 --> 00:27:49.970
[addition: All these countries
are members of the European

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:50.002
Union (EU).]

00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:50.146
[correction: Malta officially
adopted the euro in 2008, and

00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:52.680
Estonia in 2011]

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.097
Some of these countries, that
are not officially in the euro

00:27:55.097 --> 00:27:58.400
zone, use the euro
unofficially.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.980
It's not their currency, but
there's no law against you

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.620
coming in and spending euros,
so the euro seems more

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.500
distributed than that.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:16.010
So anyway, that's the most
recent central bank, but it's

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.450
the same general
structure as --

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.660
every European country has it's
own central bank, like

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:26.360
the Banca d'Italia or the
Deutsche Bundesbank.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.500
But their original purpose is
kind of gone, because they no

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.840
longer maintain a currency.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.700
There are no more Deutsche
Marks or Italian Lire.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.500
They're all using the euro.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.750
So, the real central bank is the
European Central Bank in

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:48.085
Frankfurt, led by Jean-Claude
Trichet right now

00:28:48.085 --> 00:28:53.340
[addition: as of April 2011].

00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:01.790
Bank of Japan, by the way,
became independent in 1997.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:05.830
Bank of Japan, another very
important central bank.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.570
There's been a movement in the
last few decades to make

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.340
central banks independent.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.640
This was something that our own
Federal Reserve had from

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.560
the beginning.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:21.460
It was designed to be separate
from the government.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.820
The reason was, they thought
that a government might want

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.070
to inflate the currency.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:30.960
Political pressures might at
certain times cause them to

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.220
try to influence the
central bank.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:39.260
And so, the Federal Reserve
was set up, so that the

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.380
members of the Board of
Governors had 14-year terms.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.120
They couldn't be kicked out,
except for impeachment

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.440
offenses, and so the government
couldn't control

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.535
the central bank.

00:29:52.535 --> 00:29:56.150
The independent central bank
has been very important.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:58.980
What tends to happen is, you
bring people in, who've had

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.970
long careers in banking,
who have a

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.250
reputation for integrity.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.820
And you tell them,
that you are the

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.100
custodian of a currency.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.340
You can bring in people, who
believe in the importance of a

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:14.930
stable currency, and then you
give them a 14-year term.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:15.700
And they're there.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.950
It's like the Supreme
Court, almost. You

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.200
can't kick them out.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.750
Some people think, that's why
the U.S. has had such a stable

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:28.570
price level, because of our
independent central bank.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:33.030
So many countries have fallen
into inflation that has

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.070
undermined the currency,
but the U.S. hasn't.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.320
I think, that's why there has
been a move to copy the

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.990
independent central bank.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:53.980
I wanted to talk now about
specifics of what the

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.130
central bank does.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:02.840
Notably, the Federal Reserve
System has a committee called

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:10.850
the Federal Open Markets
Committee, FOMC, Federal Open

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:14.760
Markets Committee, that meets
around once a month.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:20.310
And they issue a statement every
time they meet, and as

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.480
it is now --

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.230
actually, FOMC doesn't
go back to 1913 --

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.610
but I'm talking about the
Federal Reserve as it is now.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:34.560
This committee decides on a
range for an interest rate

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:43.230
called the ''federal funds
rate.'' And the federal funds

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:51.230
rate is an overnight interest
rate, that is charged on loans

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:55.310
between banks and some other
financial institutions.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.860
You generally would not
have access to the

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.150
federal funds rate.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:02.280
Now, you probably don't need it,
because you don't need an

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.610
overnight loan, anyway.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:09.340
Most of us would borrow money
for more than one night, but

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.110
banks, for various reasons, do
this lending and borrowing

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:17.660
every day, at least under
normal circumstances.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.160
So, we have an overnight
interest rate.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.000
There's also a longer federal
funds rate, but we're

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.990
emphasizing the overnight
rate.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.000
And it's unsecured.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.950
This is just an unsecured --
there's no collateral --

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.540
it's an unsecured loan
between banks.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.060
So, the interest rate
reflects some risk.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.050
Negligible risk, usually,
because banks trust each

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:45.670
other, at least overnight.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:49.270
They know pretty much, they're
going to get paid bank.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:54.120
And the current federal funds
rate in the United States is

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:58.660
0.13%, as of last Friday
[addition: April 1, 2011].

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:04.320
That's 13 basis points, so
it's virtually zero.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.390
This is a policy decision
of the Federal

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:08.850
Open Markets Committee.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:12.270
They have decided that the range
for the federal funds

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:18.020
rate will be between zero and 25
basis points, so as of last

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:18.290
Friday
[addition: April 1, 2011],

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:22.280
it was exactly in the middle
of their range.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:29.970
The FOMC uses its decisions to
set the federal funds rate as

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.820
a way of stabilizing
the economy.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:36.570
This is the regulator that
Dice talked about.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:40.810
Right now, they've set it
virtually at zero, because the

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:43.199
economy is so weak.

00:33:43.199 --> 00:33:45.847
The unemployment rate last week
was 8.8% [addition: as of

00:33:45.847 --> 00:33:48.900
April 1, 2011], extremely
high.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:54.420
And so, the Federal Reserve is
not worried about inflation

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.750
now, it's worried about
high unemployment.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:00.510
And it's pushed it about
as close to zero

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:03.889
as it can get it.

00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:06.340
It can't below zero, because
you can't have negative

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.230
interest rates --

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.800
no one would lend at a negative
interest rate.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:15.170
So, that's where we are.

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:26.790
Now, I wanted to just tell
you about an interesting

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:38.730
development that came in just,
well, just in 2008.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:41.960
I mentioned that banks hold
reserve accounts at the

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.510
Federal Reserve.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:46.775
Traditionally, those accounts
were not interest-paying.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:54.000
Banks had to either hold money
or an account at the Federal

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.760
Reserve for their reserves,
and neither of them pay

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.195
interest. If you hold money, you
don't get any interest. If

00:34:59.195 --> 00:35:02.270
you actually have currency in
your vault, you don't get

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:09.700
interest. And until recently,
banks didn't get interest on

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.810
their deposits at the Federal
Reserve, but that all changed

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:21.930
in 2008 with the Emergency
Economic Stabilization Act,

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:24.260
that President George
Bush signed.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.140
EESA, as it's called.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:31.370
And EESA allowed the Federal
Reserve to pay interest on the

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:35.730
reserves, held in the accounts
at the Federal Reserve.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.310
So, the Fed has a policy
now of paying

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.530
interest on reserve balances.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:47.610
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.920
I don't know what the Suffolk
Bank did, or the Bank of

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.490
England did, but I know what
the Fed is doing now.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:57.540
If a member bank puts money in
deposit with the Federal

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.520
Reserve, they will get
an interest rate.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.930
And you can find out what the
interest rate is by going to

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:05.372
the Federal Reserve website, and
right now [addition: as of

00:36:05.372 --> 00:36:06.060
April 1, 2011]

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:10.880
it is 0.25%.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:17.640
So, that's an important policy
change, because now it

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.765
encourages the holding
of reserves.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:28.330
Some people look at this, and
ask this question: Here's the

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.290
federal funds rate --

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:34.720
why isn't it the same as the
interest on reserves?

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.015
Interesting question.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.830
Why would any bank invest in the
federal funds market, if

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.380
they can get a higher interest
rate by just holding a reserve

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.980
at the Federal Reserve?

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.410
There's been a lot of discussion
of why that is now.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:00.090
It's a new phenomenon, because
the interest on reserves goes

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:04.810
back only less than
three years.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:11.670
I think the simplest answer to
the question is, that member

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:15.820
banks of the Federal Reserve
System have stopped lending on

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.850
the federal funds market,
basically.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:23.990
They just leave it in reserves,
because that's a

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.380
higher interest rate.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.780
So, who is lending at this?

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.690
It turns out that there are
some people, notably the

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:32.130
government-sponsored enterprises
like Fannie and

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:36.320
Freddie, that are not eligible
for interest on reserves.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.880
So, they have taken over the
federal funds market.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.590
The reason the Fed added
interest on reserves is to

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:49.400
create another tool of
monetary policy.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.950
There's a lot of concern that,
after this crisis is over,

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.600
there'll be a sudden
surge of inflation.

00:37:58.565 --> 00:38:00.800
Let me come back to that.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.356
Basically, what the Fed has
as a new tool is, if that

00:38:04.356 --> 00:38:11.280
happens, to raise the interest
on reserves, and that will

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.900
help contract the economy
instantly, very rapidly.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.090
The way the Fed controls the
federal funds rate, and has

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:23.020
been doing for years, is by
buying and selling Treasury

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:28.720
bills on the open market, by
affecting the supply and

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.770
demand for short-term credit.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.160
And that indirectly --

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.880
they don't actually deal in the
federal funds market, they

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.760
deal in the Treasury bill
market, but since those

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.020
markets are interlinked, they
indirectly target the federal

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.990
funds rate.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.360
So, that's the old way
of trading in the

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.500
federal funds --

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.510
not in the federal funds market
-- trading in the

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:55.610
short-term Treasury market
through the New York Fed.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.770
But now, they have a new tool.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.850
So, we're entering a whole new
regime of monetary policy.

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:09.180
So, I wanted to talk to about
reserve requirements a little

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:15.445
bit more and what those are.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:24.900
So, the Federal Reserve has
the authority to set the

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:30.600
amount of reserves that
a bank holds.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.160
I wanted to make clear the
distinction between reserve

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.900
requirements and capital
requirements.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:55.920
The Federal Reserve has what's
called Regulation D, which

00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:02.730
specifies how much banks have to
hold as a function of their

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:05.030
liabilities.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:08.950
And as of right now
[addition: April 2011],

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:16.810
the reserve requirements are 10%
of transaction accounts.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:31.590
That means, that a bank has
to total up all of the

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:38.610
transaction accounts, and that
consists of checking accounts,

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:43.210
NOW accounts, and
ATS accounts.

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:46.672
Their transactions accounts are
accounts like checks that

00:40:46.672 --> 00:40:49.890
-- people have a deposit in the
bank, that they'll use for

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:54.820
spending, and those are
instantly withdrawable.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:41:00.560
In contrast, there's something
called ''time deposits.''

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:07.090
Those are savings accounts, and
the bank does not have to

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.570
give you the money
immediately.

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:11.452
In other words, if you go
to your checking account

00:41:11.452 --> 00:41:12.990
[addition: checking account
institution], and say, I want

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:14.590
my money --

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.180
it's a transaction account --

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.790
they have to give it
to you instantly.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.300
That's the rule.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:23.810
But if you go to your savings
account, they can stall.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:25.030
You might not have noticed
it, but it's in

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.440
the fine print somewhere.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.450
This is a time deposit.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:33.670
So, the Fed is not worried
about time deposits.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:36.710
Here, we're talking about
reserve requirements.

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:41.550
Reserve requirements are still
based on the old theory that

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:43.660
we're trying to prevent
bank runs.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.450
We don't want there to be a
run on banks, where people

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:54.030
panic and try to withdraw
their money all at once.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.790
So, we want to make sure the
banks have enough reserves,

00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:00.710
and the Fed currently thinks
10% ought to be enough.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.080
For time deposits, it's zero.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.910
You don't have to
put any money on

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.010
reserve for time deposits.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:09.520
Why does the Fed think that?

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.990
Because you've got 60, 90 days,
or a year to pay the

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:16.120
person back, so they
can't run on you.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.490
So, we don't require any reserve
requirements against

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:22.070
time deposits.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:25.810
But it's 10% for transactions
accounts, which is

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:28.120
substantial, because they're
still worried about this.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.390
So, this is the situation.

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:37.772
We used to emphasize in lectures
about central banking

00:42:37.772 --> 00:42:42.330
the so-called ''money
multiplier.'' The money

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:46.770
multiplier, well, it's
complicated, but the simplest

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:50.165
thing is, it might be one over
the reserve requirement.

00:42:50.165 --> 00:42:53.840
It's not exactly that, but if
the reserve requirement is

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:59.610
10%, then the total amount of
deposits, that banks can

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:04.230
issue, is going to be 10 times
the amount of currency and

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:07.140
deposits they have at
the Federal Reserve.

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.670
So, that means that the reserve
requirements would fix

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:19.390
the money supply under the
old theory, because the

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:23.550
high-powered money is the
currency plus deposits at the

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.380
Federal Reserve --

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:25.500
that's reserves --

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.130
and if the reserve requirement
is 10%, and banks want to just

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:32.390
meet that requirement and
nothing more, they're going to

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:37.530
have 10 times as much deposits
as there are reserves.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:40.230
I'm over-simplifying the money
multiplier, but I'm telling

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:43.690
you that, at the moment in
history, it's irrelevant

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:47.840
because banks are holding
excess reserves.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.090
The world has changed.

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:56.740
Just a few years ago, before
this financial crisis, banks

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.420
didn't want to hold excess
reserves, and so there were

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.300
hardly any excess reserves.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.070
Why?

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:04.950
Because they don't get
any interest on them.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:08.160
And so, banks didn't hold
excess reserves.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.820
So, the money multiplier theory
would work, because the

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:15.700
amount of reserve was just about
exactly equal to 10% of

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:16.590
transactions.

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:20.220
I'm over-simplifying, but
something like that was true.

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:24.930
But now they're paying 25 basis
points on reserves, so

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:27.650
that's a lot more than you can
get investing in the federal

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:30.990
funds market, so banks are just
perfectly happy to hold

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:32.760
excess reserves.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.990
So, the excess reserves
now are over --

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:39.790
I think it's $1.2 trillion.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:44.970
It's huge, because of interest
on reserves.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:52.570
I don't have the exact number.

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:55.610
But something has fundamentally
changed in just

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:58.380
the last few years.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:03.290
So, reserve requirements, they
must hold for some banks, but

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:05.630
for most banks, they don't
even look at reserve

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:06.930
requirements anymore.

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:07.980
What do I care?

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:12.370
I'm so happy the hold reserves,
I'll hold way more

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:13.440
than they require.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.440
So, reserve requirements are
non-binding for most banks

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:23.530
now, so it's a different
world.

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:29.780
This brings us, then, to
capital requirements.

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.670
So, in the world --

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:34.140
history has always changed --
the world, as of a few years

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.780
ago, everyone emphasized reserve
requirements, and

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:40.970
those were the requirements
that had as its motive

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:43.140
preventing bank runs.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.450
But we're not going to have a
bank run now, when these banks

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:49.560
have over a trillion dollars
just sitting there.

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:53.720
They're holding so much, that
it's not an issue right now.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:58.080
So, something else has taking
the center stage, and that is

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.695
capital requirements, which
we talked about last time

00:46:01.695 --> 00:46:03.430
[correction: in the lecture
about banks].

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:14.140
So, capital requirements are
different from reserve

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.890
requirements.

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:18.450
I just defined --

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:22.260
reserve requirements
were a fraction of

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:24.140
the transaction accounts.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.420
They were defined by a liability
of the bank.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.110
A transaction account is like
a checking account.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:33.880
It's money that the bank owes
to other people, and we have

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:40.260
this requirement, that 10%
of that is the reserve

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.260
requirement.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.890
But capital requirements are
different, and they're more

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:49.320
likely to be binding
these days.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.900
And these were emphasized in
Basel III, which we talked

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.760
about before.

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.946
Basel III is not yet in force.

00:47:08.946 --> 00:47:10.480
It's going to take
a long time.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:15.520
Basel III has a phase-in period
that is going to take

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.870
until, I think it's 2019.

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:22.400
But there's a lot of talk
now about trying to get

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.720
Basel III phased in.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.125
Remember, we talked about
risk-weighted assets?

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:40.470
Now, it is, banks have to hold
capital as a fraction of their

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.570
risk-weighted assets.

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:45.130
So, right now, the countries of
the world, they've agreed,

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:48.140
the G-20 countries have
agreed on Basel III.

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.120
But each country has
to decide on the

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.390
implementation of Basel III.

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:56.170
The United States, in
particular, is having problems

00:47:56.170 --> 00:48:08.550
with Basel III, because Basel
III refers to credit ratings

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:09.800
in many places.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:23.580
But Dodd-Frank, the Dodd-Frank
Act of 2010

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.950
abolishes credit ratings.

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:30.080
The government will no longer
make any use, in any

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.640
regulation, of credit ratings.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.910
Remember what credit
ratings are.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:39.970
Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's
are the two best-known credit

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:41.810
rating agencies.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:50.950
The government, the SEC,
starting in 1975 defined what

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:52.410
they called NRSROs.

00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:02.280
That's Nationally Recognized
Statistical Rating

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.530
Organization.

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:11.840
And that included Moody's, which
was founded about 1900,

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:15.231
and Standard &amp; Poor's, which was
the result of the merger

00:49:15.231 --> 00:49:20.950
of Standards Statistical
Association and Poor's a

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:22.670
little bit after 1900.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:26.260
They're venerable old
institutions that give a risk

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.000
rating for securities.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.540
For example, Moody's
will give its best

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.660
securities a AAA rating.

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:37.410
That means, Moody's thinks
they'll never default.

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:44.420
Yale University is rated AAA
by Moody's, for example.

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.010
But if they don't like you
quite as much, they'll

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:49.550
down-rate you to AA.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:54.130
Or if they don't like you even
more, you're only A. And then

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:57.300
God forbid, you go
down into the Bs.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:01.960
In fact, Moody, John Moody, in
this book, acknowledges that

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:06.520
he took the same grading system
that he got in college.

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.240
It's a little different.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.470
You don't get a AAA grade
here, do you?

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:11.250
I've never given a AAA.

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:14.565
But that's, how Moody saw
it, so it survived.

00:50:14.565 --> 00:50:17.820
It's like letter grades
to securities.

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:20.050
But Moody did that in 1900.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:25.010
If you read his autobiography,
people said, you're crazy.

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:27.820
How can you give a grade
to a security?

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:31.670
It seemed like a wild idea, but
he stuck with it, and over

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:35.540
the years, people began to
believe in them more and more.

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:40.150
So, it led to the idea that we
fully understand the risk of

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:45.430
securities, and so, a
complacency set in, and the

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:49.980
government started to recognize
these NRSROs as if

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:53.290
they were proclaimers
of God's truth.

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:55.920
And they started all kinds of
regulations, said what your

00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:00.540
capital had to be depending on
the rating of various assets

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.720
that you hold.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.420
But the whole thing collapsed
in the recent financial

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.890
crisis, because some AAA
securities lost almost

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:10.840
everything.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:16.320
So, the rating agencies made a
big problem, or issue, and so

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:21.830
Congress has now said, nobody
can make any regulation based

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:26.150
on ratings of the NRSROs.

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:28.580
But Basel III people didn't
get the message.

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.010
But they're not America, they're
international, and

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:33.140
they still believe in them.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:37.880
I think it's a little bit
difficult to know how to

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:38.730
handle risk.

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:40.870
This is the fundamental
problem.

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:45.120
And it would be nice, if Moody's
and S&amp;P could tell us,

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.680
but the problem is that they
missed this whole crisis.

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.600
They didn't see it coming.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:51.370
And why didn't they?

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:54.340
Well, that's a deep issue, but
that's what people are

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:56.090
wrestling with right now.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:52:00.170
So, the U.S. has to figure out
what to do to reinterpret the

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:04.280
Basel III recommendations for
the United States without

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.320
using any reference to Moody's
and S&amp;P. What will probably

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:12.620
happen, I think, is, that the
banks will have to have their

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.200
own risk committees, and they
will have to come up with

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.350
their own assessments of
risk, and they'll be

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:18.970
responsible for those.

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:21.360
But what will really happen is,
they'll just look at the

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.460
Moody's and S&amp;P ratings.

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:26.230
It'll be rubber-stamping them.

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.990
So, I don't think that --

00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:30.680
there's a whole question whether
Dodd-Frank will be

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:34.750
effective in reducing
our requirement.

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:38.130
But I wanted to go over the
capital requirements once

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:42.180
again, because now they're
increasingly important.

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:47.460
And I wanted to go through
just a simple example of

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:50.180
capital requirements, so that
you'll understand them.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:58.530
And I don't think, the general
public understands them very

00:52:58.530 --> 00:52:59.780
well at all.

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:09.820
This is old accounting,
or old finance.

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.310
These requirements go
back 100 years.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:14.760
I'm going to talk in very
simple terms about them,

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.180
over-simplifying.

00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:19.720
Basel III is a complicated
new agreement.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:22.620
It has a lot of ins and outs,
but I'm just going to

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:26.070
over-simplify it and talk about
the Basel III common

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.660
equity requirements.

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:33.190
I'm going to tell a
little story about

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:34.660
founding a bank, OK?

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:37.630
Now that's just to understand
how capital requirements work.

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:42.660
So, imagine that you decided
to found a bank.

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.730
In developed countries of the
world today, you can do this.

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:47.970
You can set up your own bank.

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:49.893
The only problem you have, you
have to get a charter, you

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:51.200
have to apply for a charter.

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.930
You have to decide, whether
you're a national bank in the

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:56.300
United States or some other kind
of bank, but you get a

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.402
charter and you open
your doors.

00:53:58.402 --> 00:54:00.680
Now you've got to start
complying with capital

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.780
requirements.

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:07.030
But let's say you do
that, all right?

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:10.570
You find that there's an empty
bank building downtown.

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:13.980
You rent the building, you go
through the paperwork, and you

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.470
set up your bank, and
you open the doors.

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:19.550
And now, we have one of those
windows with a teller, and are

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:21.850
inviting deposits.

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:25.520
So, I'm going to tell a story,
which is over-simplified maybe

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.720
a little bit.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:32.070
Let's say, that you open your
doors, and someone walks in

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:36.060
with $100 and deposits it.

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:39.240
So, this is your bank,
or I'll say my bank.

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.660
Now, I think regulators would
require you to come up with

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:50.940
some capital first, but it seems
to be a nicer story --

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:51.975
you start out with a deposit.

00:54:51.975 --> 00:54:54.630
Assume your regulators
allowed you to start.

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:57.430
So, somebody walks in and
deposits, and here's your

00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:00.320
assets, and here's
your liabilities.

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:03.640
Left side is assets, right
side is liabilities.

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:08.790
So, someone deposits $100
in cash to your bank.

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:13.800
So, you've got an
asset of $100.

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:19.400
And you have a liability
now of $100.

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.920
If that's a savings account,
you don't have any reserve

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.460
requirements.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:27.630
If it's a transactions account,
you have to hold $10.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:28.590
I've got it, right?

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.710
I've got $100 sitting in my
vault, because the guy just

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:34.870
gave me $100, so I'm satisfying
both my reserve

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:36.960
requirements and --

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.810
Now, am I satisfying my
capital requirements?

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:42.900
Well, I have to calculate
risk-weighted assets.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:46.410
Remember, every kind of
asset has its risk.

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:47.490
What about cash?

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:52.450
Well, cash has a zero risk, so
it has a zero risk-weighting.

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:58.480
So right now, my risk-weighted
assets equal zero.

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:03.820
OK, I've got to satisfy all the

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:05.710
regulations that are on me.

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:08.890
I'm satisfying my reserve
requirements, right?

00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:11.070
I've got my reserve,
I've got $100.

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:20.060
This is cash in my safe, and
this is a liability.

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:25.920
I owe $100 in the form of
a, let's say it's a

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.120
transactions account.

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:35.520
Whenever this person comes back,
I've got to pay $100.

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:39.160
So, my reserve requirements are
satisfied, because I've

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:42.510
got more than $10 of my
transactions account.

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:44.300
My risk-weighted assets
are zero.

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:50.210
Now, Basel III says, that you
have to hold 4.5% of your

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:54.800
risk-weighted assets
as capital.

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.610
But now, wait a minute.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:58.150
I have a problem.

00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:00.950
What is my capital here?

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:02.310
I don't have any capital.

00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:08.250
I've just opened my doors, and
I've got $100 in assets, $100

00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:09.900
in liabilities.

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.500
Everything looks okay from the
perspective of the reserve

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.740
requirement, but there's
no capital.

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:17.010
So, what is capital?

00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:23.610
I have to issue shares to come
up with capital, and I'm

00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:24.860
going to need --

00:57:26.685 --> 00:57:31.890
Basel III says, 4.5% common
equity requirement.

00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:40.790
And they also have something
called a capital conservation

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:42.430
buffer, which is another 2.5%.

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.950
Plus 2.5%, which you don't
absolutely have to hold, but

00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:52.600
if you don't hold it, you're
subject to restrictions, so

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.400
I'm going to add these.

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.090
This is the capital conservation
buffer.

00:57:56.090 --> 00:58:01.150
I've got to hold 7%
under Basel III.

00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:05.410
And I don't have any
capital here.

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:06.820
So, what do I do?

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.670
I'm not in compliance.

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:12.030
So, I've got to raise capital.

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:15.460
So, what I can do is I
can issues shares.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:21.520
I have to sell shares
in the business.

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:26.510
So, all I need to do
is sell seven --

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:29.130
OK, what would it be?

00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:35.200
Let's say, I issue
$20 in shares.

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.910
And then, that means someone
gives me more cash, because

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:41.860
someone paid for the shares.

00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:45.410
So, I've now got $120.

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:49.500
Well, I add another plus $20,
so it's a total of assets of

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:55.420
$120, all held in cash.

00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.580
Now, this is a different
kind of liability.

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.595
This is common equity.

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:10.170
And the regulators make a big
distinction between this kind

00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:13.670
of liability, the transactions
account, and this kind of

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:15.280
liability, the $20.

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.320
Why do they make a
big distinction?

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.010
Because this guy can come
to the window any time.

00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:23.890
You've got to give him $100,
whenever this person asks.

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:27.140
The shareholders have no
demand on you at all.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.560
They own a share
of the company.

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.720
They can't come to the window
and demand anything.

00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.580
You can just send them away.

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:37.640
The only deal you have with
shareholders is, that all

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:43.190
shareholders will receive an
equal dividend, if the board

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.250
of directors decides to vote
for dividends -- they're

00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:46.970
shareholders in the company.

00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:48.580
But they can't run the bank.

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:50.880
The shareholders can't show up
at the window, so there's no

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.105
risk of bank runs for them.

00:59:53.105 --> 00:59:56.100
And there's no risk of problems,
because if anything

00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:58.790
goes bad, you just tell the
common equity guys, you're

00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:02.780
out, you lost.

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.470
So now, what are my
risk-weighted assets?

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:06.450
They're still zero.

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:08.630
I've got $120 in cash.

01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:09.610
Zero --

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:11.160
I don't have any --

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.420
7% times zero is zero.

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.750
So now, I'm in great shape.

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:18.850
I've satisfied both my reserve
requirements and I've

01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:22.140
satisfied my Basel III
capital requirements.

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:27.380
So, what do we do next?

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:31.570
We've created a bank, and
there's no interest paid on

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:33.980
these checking accounts, and
we're not earning any

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.360
interest. We've got a bank
and we're satisfying the

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.525
requirements, but nobody's
making any money, so we've got

01:00:39.525 --> 01:00:42.560
to do something to make money.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.850
So what I'm going to do is, I'm
going to -- let's say we

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:47.990
get our board of directors
meeting --

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:50.350
a board of directors elected
by the common equity

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:51.600
shareholders --

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:56.640
and we decide, let's make
some corporate loans.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.050
So, why don't we lend out all
of this $100, that was cash,

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:03.980
and lend it to some business as
a corporate loan, and we'll

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:04.850
charge them interest?

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:06.980
Now, we're going to start
making money.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:14.160
So, this is no longer cash in
safe, this is corporate loans.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.010
Loans to corporations
to do business.

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:20.850
So, there we are.

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:24.510
Our balance sheet balances,
everything looks fine.

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:26.870
But what are our risk-weighted
assets now?

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:30.280
Well, you remember, corporate
loans get 100% risk-weight,

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.770
because under Basel --

01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:36.320
going back to Basel I, they
always thought corporate loans

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.000
are risky assets.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.130
So, my risk-weighted assets
are now $100.

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:48.100
And 7% of $100 is $7.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.090
So, hey, I'm doing fine.

01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:53.290
Now, we're capitalized enough,
we're in business.

01:01:53.290 --> 01:01:56.540
We're satisfying both our
reserve requirements --

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.790
reserve requirements
being 10% --

01:01:58.790 --> 01:01:59.990
and that's only $12
[correction: $10],

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:01.850
we've got it in cash--

01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:06.260
and we're satisfying our Basel
III capital requirements.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.920
So, everything is fine.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.040
Everything is fine and
we're in business.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.890
And we're not done
yet, because our

01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:16.400
risk-weighted assets --

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.790
our $7 is the capital
requirement, and we've got $20

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:23.770
in common equity.

01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:24.980
So, everything is great.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.100
This is fine.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.090
But now, let's go on.

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:29.120
Now, there's a crisis.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.930
Business gets bad.

01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:35.210
So, the next thing that happens
is 20% of my corporate

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.460
loans default.

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:41.500
And so, we then --

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:44.040
it becomes clear, we have
another board meeting, and

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.370
someone says, I have bad news:
We made $100 in corporate

01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:50.150
loans, but these guys
-- $20 is never

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:51.170
going to get paid back.

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:53.250
The borrower is out
of business.

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:56.170
So, I suggest, we do a write-off
of our corporate

01:02:56.170 --> 01:03:02.470
loans, and lets reduce
them to $80.

01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:03.910
So, what happens?

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:05.735
Now, assets have to
equal liabilities.

01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:11.890
$100 is our assets now, not
$120, right, because

01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:13.960
we just lost $20.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.450
Our liabilities can't be
$120, because they have

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:18.850
to equal our assets.

01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:20.250
What gives?

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:24.050
Well, it's the shareholders
that give, so we mark down

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.780
common equity to zero.

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:32.010
And now, assets and
liabilities match.

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:34.360
So now, let's look at
our requirements.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.710
What about our reserve
requirements?

01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:39.150
Reserve requirements are fine.

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:41.700
We're holding excess reserves.

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:46.190
We've only have to hold $10,
and we've got $20 in cash.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:49.790
But we're no longer satisfying
our capital requirements.

01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:53.970
So, our bank regulator is going
to shut us down, unless

01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:57.200
we do something to
raise capital.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.810
So, how do we raise capital?

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:00.260
That's the next step.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:05.890
Well, one thing we could do is,
we could sell some of our

01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:07.140
corporate loans.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.080
We could find a buyer for our
corporate bonds, and we could

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.000
sell, say, $20 worth of them,
bring this down to $60, and

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.710
this would go up to $40.

01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:23.210
Our risk-weighted assets
would now --

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:23.740
let me see.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:24.790
No, that wouldn't do it.

01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:26.200
Sorry, that wouldn't
do it, would it?

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.190
We'd still have --

01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:29.440
I'm sorry, I misspoke.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.910
We still don't have
any common equity.

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:36.560
In this case, if we don't have
any common equity, we can't

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.310
get out of this by selling
our loans.

01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:41.430
We could have, if it didn't
reduce it to zero.

01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:45.110
If the common equity went down
to $10, then I could sell some

01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:48.430
of my corporate loans to
get out of this mess.

01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:52.030
But I made it zero, so the only
way out that I can do, is

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:53.840
to issue more shares.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.790
So, I've got to go to my friends
again and say, well,

01:04:56.790 --> 01:04:59.550
we started this bank,
but we goofed up.

01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:02.640
We made bad loans, and so we've

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.610
exhausted our common actually.

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:10.980
I've got to raise more
capital now.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:14.460
And so, what you could do is,
get more friends to come in.

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.480
Now, they might not want to do
it, because the previous

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.790
friends got wiped out.

01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:19.500
They lost everything, right?

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.220
But you're coming in as new
shareholders on top of the

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:27.590
old, and you could then go back
to where you were before

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:30.930
by just issuing march shares.

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:32.880
So, this is the system.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.920
I think I've pretty much
summarized it.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:37.630
It's simple.

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:43.710
Now, the issue is, however,
that, what motivated Basel III

01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:44.960
was that --

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.710
this system of requiring banks
to hold capital is supposed to

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:53.520
stabilize the system.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.640
If they've got enough common
equity, the bank won't go

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:00.100
bankrupt, even if they lose some
of their corporate loans.

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:06.140
It would be a big disaster to
drive them to insolvency.

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:11.440
But the problem is that the
system they set up has banks

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:17.970
responding to a crisis by
selling corporate loans or

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:19.630
issuing new shares.

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:24.000
The problem is, both of those
are hard to do in a crisis.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.460
In a crisis, when everything is
falling apart, you go out

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.970
saying, I want to issue new
shares in my bank that just

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:32.982
lost everything, the investors
are going to say, you have got

01:06:32.982 --> 01:06:33.960
to be kidding.

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.060
I'm not going to invest
in you right now.

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:38.480
So, you can't raise
new equity.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.330
OK, what about selling loans?

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:43.580
Well, the problem is, in a big
national or international

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:46.690
crisis, every bank on the planet
is trying to sell its

01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:48.550
loans at the same time.

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:51.230
So, it creates a collapse
in the system.

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:53.890
And this is, what happened
in the financial crisis.

01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:58.440
This story repeated a million
times: Banks were trying to

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.680
raise capital and they were
trying to sell assets either

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.460
by issuing --

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:04.420
they were trying to raise
capital either by issuing

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.200
shares or by selling assets.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.360
And everyone doing it at the
same time created a crunch,

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.250
and the whole system would have
collapsed, if it weren't

01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:14.360
for the central banks.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:20.820
The central banks of the world
responded quickly by making

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:25.440
loans to companies, to banks
and other companies.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:29.000
So, the lender of last resort
saved the whole system from

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:29.930
collapsing.

01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:33.740
That's the story of the
financial crisis.

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.760
The remaining story is, the
Basel III people in

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.850
Switzerland said, let's
analyze how we

01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:41.140
got into this situation.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.650
How did it get so bad?

01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:46.330
And they thought, you know, it's
kind of a funny system,

01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:52.109
because we're requiring banks to
raise capital at the worst

01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:56.260
time, and that can't be
the right system.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:59.569
They looked around and tried to
decide what to do better.

01:07:59.569 --> 01:08:01.520
Most countries of the
world were following

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.990
this kind of system.

01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:05.010
There were some --

01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:08.029
some people were impressed by
the government of Spain having

01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:11.189
a better system, but the
Spanish banking system

01:08:11.189 --> 01:08:16.850
collapsed anyway, so it didn't
solve the problem.

01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:26.140
So, Basel III came up with a
solution, which was to allow

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:40.450
the central regulators to add
another buffer of 2.5%, if

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:43.330
they think, there's
a bubble going on.

01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:48.330
They would do this before the
crisis, and that raises the

01:08:48.330 --> 01:08:50.229
common equity requirement
to 9.5%.

01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:56.040
So, the idea is, this is going
to be a problem --

01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:00.510
raising capital at a time of
difficulty is always going to

01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:02.180
be a problem.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.649
And we can always rely again
on our central banks, but

01:09:05.649 --> 01:09:09.210
maybe we can't, maybe
we shouldn't.

01:09:09.210 --> 01:09:13.040
And so the idea is, let's take
bank regulators and make it

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.590
their obligation to raise
capital requirements in

01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:19.229
advance, when they see
a bubble coming.

01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:22.300
Now, another thing that happened
in the United States

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:27.990
is the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.

01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:33.670
Because of intense public
reaction to all the bailouts,

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:39.620
it said that the Federal Reserve
can no longer use

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:43.030
discretion in deciding
who to bail out.

01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:46.290
They can operate a discount
window, but it has to be

01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:48.470
completely fair and
even for everyone.

01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:51.925
They can't decide, we're going
to bail out Bear Sterns, and

01:09:51.925 --> 01:09:55.140
we're going to let Lehman
Brothers fail.

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:58.830
All they can do is operate a
consistent discount window.

01:09:58.830 --> 01:10:01.260
So, they've constrained --

01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:04.480
the Dodd-Frank Act constrained
the central bank in the United

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.360
States from exercising the kind
of judgment that saved us

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.020
from the crisis.

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:12.650
And we're going to have to rely
on some different things,

01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:17.120
like better capital standards,
like Basel

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.880
III, to fix the situation.

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.150
Whether we're there or not, is
going to be a big question.

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:29.900
This is a complicated system,
and we put a lot of the best

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:33.980
minds into trying to figure out,
how to prevent the kind

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.330
of instability that we're seeing
in this example, where

01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:40.960
everyone is short on capital at
the same time, everyone is

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.290
selling loans at the
same time, and the

01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:45.250
whole system collapses.

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:49.070
We've come up with different
solutions, but they have to be

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:51.285
implemented yet, and there are
problems of implementation.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:58.230
The roles of central banks and
of regulatory authorities are

01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:02.710
evolving and changing, and
it'll be a period of many

01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:08.370
years, before we know where the
system is actually going.

01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:08.610
All right.

01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:10.400
I will stop here.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:17.380
Next lecture is on investment
banking, and we have a former

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:23.300
ECON 252 student, Jon Fougner,
who is back after nine years,

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:27.380
and he will tell us about his
experiences as an investment

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:31.430
banker, and also as a
Facebook executive.

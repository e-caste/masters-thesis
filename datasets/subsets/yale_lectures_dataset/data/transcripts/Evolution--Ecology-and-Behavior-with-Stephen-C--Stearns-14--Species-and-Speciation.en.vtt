00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.305
Prof: Okay,
today I have put up a slide

00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:07.310
from the first lecture,
just as a signpost and landmark

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.790
to make sure that you're
oriented on the path through the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.590
course.
 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.280
Basically the material we cover
before Spring Break is organized

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.453
into these large sections,
and today we're making the

00:00:22.453 --> 00:00:25.440
transition from microevolution
to macroevolution.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.791
And you'll recall that in
microevolution we had six

00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:31.740
lectures on microevolutionary
principles,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.651
and then we had five lectures,
that we just completed last

00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:37.708
time,
on how phenotypes,

00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:42.570
organisms, how they're designed
for reproductive success.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.169
We're now going to make the
transition into

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:48.931
macroevolutionary principles,
with the process that connects

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:51.010
microevolution to
macroevolution,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.700
and that is speciation.
 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.017
So as we now move into
macroevolution,

00:00:57.017 --> 00:01:01.408
today's talk is really mostly
about speciation.

00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:04.567
Then we will,
next time, have a talk about

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:09.346
phylogenetics and systematics,
and then about how you can use

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:12.703
the combination of these
principles to look at

00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:16.360
evolutionary trees and to place
them on maps,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.188
and then to place the evolution
of traits onto trees and onto

00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:22.833
maps,
so that you can integrate space

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.200
and time,
and history.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.840
Then we have three ways of
looking at the history of life.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.260
The first is more abstract,
I think a little bit deeper,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.941
and that has to do with key
events in evolution:

00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:40.292
origin of life,
multi-cellularity,

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:42.349
language, things like that.
 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:46.090
We'll have a review of major
events in the geological

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.810
theater.
 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.262
For those of you that like
firecrackers on the Fourth of

00:01:49.262 --> 00:01:51.914
July that's fun,
because that's where we have

00:01:51.914 --> 00:01:55.459
meteorite impacts and
extinctions and stuff like that.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.873
And then we'll take a look at
the fossil record and what it-

00:01:58.873 --> 00:02:02.287
the kinds of unique insights
that you can get out of fossils

00:02:02.287 --> 00:02:05.414
that you really can't get out of
just looking at living

00:02:05.414 --> 00:02:06.340
organisms.
 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.192
So those are three different
ways to approach the issue of

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:11.680
the history of life.
 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.150
Okay, today speciation.
 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.092
I would hope that by the end of
today's lecture and the end of

00:02:20.092 --> 00:02:23.520
your reading and discussion in
section about this,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.659
that you would be able to deal
with this set of issues.

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.039
What is a species?
 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:30.758
How do they originate?
 

00:02:30.758 --> 00:02:34.198
What kinds of experimental
evidence or observational

00:02:34.198 --> 00:02:37.906
evidence do we have to back up
the claims about how they

00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:38.848
originate?
 

00:02:38.848 --> 00:02:41.407
What's going on during
speciation, from the point of

00:02:41.407 --> 00:02:44.502
view of genetics;
if we track the genes through

00:02:44.502 --> 00:02:47.680
the process of speciation,
what do we see?

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.274
And then there are some special
issues: asexual species and

00:02:51.274 --> 00:02:52.389
cryptic species.
 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.400
I would like to signal that
this is a part of biology in

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.740
which some of your teaching
fellows have special expertise.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.908
So if you would like to get to
the cutting edge of phylogenetic

00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:06.925
research,
you have got some people in

00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:11.343
section who can help you,
and this department happens to

00:03:11.343 --> 00:03:13.750
be particularly good at that.
 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.175
There was a front page report
in the New York- well on

00:03:18.175 --> 00:03:21.788
the Science Page of the New
York Times,

00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:24.952
in their Darwin Section,
they were reporting on Stephen

00:03:24.952 --> 00:03:25.714
Smith's Ph.D.
 

00:03:25.714 --> 00:03:26.300
thesis.
 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.800
He just got his degree here
last year.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.060
But he assembled the largest
Tree of Life for the plants.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.060
So we've got people like that
running around,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.560
and you ought to tap into them,
if you feel the urge.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.139
Okay?
 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.311
Now here is a basic
observation, and it is one of

00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:47.526
those things that just seems so
natural to us that it doesn't

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:52.479
occur at first sight to ask how
it might be that way.

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.770
But in fact it is a puzzle.
 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.280
We have wild diversity in the
world.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.020
Please forgive me botanists.
 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.919
I had some help assembling this
slide.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.270
I would like to have had a few
more neat plants in there;

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.938
there are some incredibly neat
plants that could go in there.

00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:12.340
But if we just look at the
world, it's amazingly diverse.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.628
Okay?
 

00:04:12.628 --> 00:04:14.899
So we look out there and
there's lots of different kinds

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:19.418
of organisms,
and they seem to be in discrete

00:04:19.418 --> 00:04:22.425
groups,
separated from other such

00:04:22.425 --> 00:04:25.370
groups, and in many ways:
appearance,

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.240
behavior, ecology, genetics.
 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.560
So why is the world like this?
 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.870
How did that come about?
 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.310
Why is the planet not simply
covered with a homogenous layer

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.644
of primordial slime,
rather than these different

00:04:39.644 --> 00:04:40.660
things?
 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.569
For a long time it wasn't that
way really.

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.274
The prokaryotic world was
genetically diverse,

00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:51.721
but it certainly didn't have
this kind of morphological

00:04:51.721 --> 00:04:53.370
diversity in it.
 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.384
Well those things that are
separated are called species,

00:04:57.384 --> 00:05:01.324
and this is the guy who
profoundly influenced this kind

00:05:01.324 --> 00:05:02.420
of biology.
 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.899
His name's Ernst Mayr.
 

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:08.300
Ernst died a few years ago at
the age of 100-and-something.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.990
So he managed to keep active
for a very long time.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.069
I knew him.
 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.449
He was an impressive guy and he
had an almost unprecedented

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.000
ability to claim that he had
already said it.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.220
Now his definition of what a
species is--

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.980
this is from a version of a
book that he wrote in 1963,

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.459
but he had been working on this
idea from about 1942,

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:44.221
and his idea was that a species
is a group of actually or

00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:48.812
potentially inter-breeding
natural populations that are

00:05:48.812 --> 00:05:53.149
reproductively isolated from
other such groups.

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:57.495
So it's the capacity for
reproducing together that unites

00:05:57.495 --> 00:06:01.581
the members of a species,
and it's the inability or the

00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:05.341
lack of opportunity to reproduce
with individuals of other

00:06:05.341 --> 00:06:09.100
populations that marks the
separation between species;

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.560
according to Mayr.
 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.620
Now there were very good
reasons for this definition,

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.230
and it really captures the
essence of genetic separation.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.040
But there are cases where it
doesn't apply.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.074
As a matter of fact,
I think that biology has a

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:32.600
profound capacity to erode the
categories invented by humans.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.379
&gt;
 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:36.300
There are almost always
exceptions.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.928
To that, I would like to add
that Ernst Mayr was a great

00:06:39.928 --> 00:06:42.678
ornithologist,
and that the kinds of patterns

00:06:42.678 --> 00:06:45.589
you see in species,
in birds, were what motivated

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:47.910
him to come up with this
definition,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.935
and if he had been a plant
biologist he probably wouldn't

00:06:50.935 --> 00:06:52.610
have defined things this way.
 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.319
Okay?
 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.120
Now just something to think
about.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.480
Does everything really have to
belong to a species?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.444
Would there be some itch that
you needed to be scratched if

00:07:06.444 --> 00:07:09.110
not everything belonged to a
species?

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.540
Would that make you unhappy for
some reason?

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.088
I'm going to let that one hang
in the air.

00:07:15.088 --> 00:07:19.810
Okay, now when we look out
there and we see that things are

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.153
separated,
there are some pretty

00:07:22.153 --> 00:07:25.759
straightforward mechanisms that
actually separate things,

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:29.488
and so this is part of the
vocabulary building exercise for

00:07:29.488 --> 00:07:32.740
speciation science;
and it's also a little bit of

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.329
biology.
 

00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:35.666
There are isolating mechanisms
that are common,

00:07:35.666 --> 00:07:38.055
they fall into three
categories, and they look a

00:07:38.055 --> 00:07:40.240
little different in plants and
animals.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.444
The first category is
pre-mating or pre-zygotic

00:07:43.444 --> 00:07:46.142
isolation,
and in plants that's often

00:07:46.142 --> 00:07:48.319
determined--
not always but often--by

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:50.560
pollinator behavior and
flowering times,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.502
and in animals it is determined
by mating behavior and gamete

00:07:54.502 --> 00:07:55.160
release.
 

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.459
So here we have actually a
place where sexual selection,

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:02.209
from the last lecture,
connects into speciation,

00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:06.480
because who you choose as your
mate is going to determine

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.209
whether there's an opportunity
for inter-specific hybridization

00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:12.050
or not.
 

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.819
So this is actually an issue
about mate choice,

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:18.309
which is kind of at a higher
hierarchical level than the

00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:22.242
issue of should I choose my mate
for resources or good genes or

00:08:22.242 --> 00:08:24.589
sexy sons or something like
that?

00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:28.093
Should I choose a mate,
because in mating with that

00:08:28.093 --> 00:08:32.438
individual I will form hybrids
or I will form members of my own

00:08:32.438 --> 00:08:33.279
species?
 

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:36.399
In a minute you'll see some
pollinator behavior slides;

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:38.220
so just to anticipate that.
 

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:42.211
It is quite possible for plants
to be separated just by

00:08:42.211 --> 00:08:43.470
flowering time.
 

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.700
Imagine a valley that's running
east-west,

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.850
in a temperate area of the
planet, and it is getting sun

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.019
earlier on one slope than on the
other,

00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:56.908
simply because of the angle of
the sun to the earth.

00:08:56.908 --> 00:08:59.826
Everything's going to speed up
on the warm slope and slow down

00:08:59.826 --> 00:09:01.746
on the cold slope,
and you're going to get

00:09:01.746 --> 00:09:04.100
different flowering times for
purely biophysical reasons,

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.649
on the two slopes.
 

00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:09.264
So initially a plant population
might come in after maybe the

00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:12.639
glacier has melted off and
colonize those two slopes,

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:15.892
and they wouldn't be able to
avoid having different flowering

00:09:15.892 --> 00:09:17.909
times,
and therefore starting to

00:09:17.909 --> 00:09:20.360
separate genetically on the two
slopes.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.980
So there are all kinds of
reasons for separation to start.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:31.277
Now the second class of
isolating mechanisms occurs a

00:09:31.277 --> 00:09:35.246
bit later;
it's post-pollination or after

00:09:35.246 --> 00:09:36.529
insemination.
 

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:42.940
And in plants there are--and
actually in many algae and

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:49.350
ciliates--there are
self-incompatibility mechanisms.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.408
These are actually put in place
through recognition molecules.

00:09:53.408 --> 00:09:57.086
And there is an
interesting--gamete biology is

00:09:57.086 --> 00:09:58.639
very interesting.
 

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:00.918
There's a lot of mate choice
which is going on at the level

00:10:00.918 --> 00:10:03.158
of the sperm finding the egg and
the egg sitting there and

00:10:03.158 --> 00:10:04.582
deciding,
"Do I want this one or

00:10:04.582 --> 00:10:04.940
not?"
 

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.639
Throw that one away and take
another one.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:10.825
And these are mediated by well
understood enzymatic reactions

00:10:10.825 --> 00:10:14.139
and protein structures;
bindin and lysine.

00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:19.048
The self-incompatibility
argument in plants basically has

00:10:19.048 --> 00:10:23.518
to do with the costs of
inbreeding, and the costs of

00:10:23.518 --> 00:10:24.570
selfing.
 

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:29.469
And the arena in which that
takes place is after the pollen

00:10:29.469 --> 00:10:34.621
grain lands on the style of the
flower and starts to grow down

00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:37.442
the style,
towards the ovary of the

00:10:37.442 --> 00:10:41.456
flower, the tissues that are in
the style are checking out that

00:10:41.456 --> 00:10:44.609
particular pollen grain,
which is making basically a

00:10:44.609 --> 00:10:47.761
little plant-like thing,
as it grows down towards the

00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:51.820
eggs, and that is where the
self-recognition is implemented.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.100
If its pollen is coming from
that same plant,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.558
it'll get killed at that point.
 

00:10:57.558 --> 00:11:04.398
So there are post-pollination
and post-insemination mechanisms

00:11:04.398 --> 00:11:06.080
of isolation.
 

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.710
Now after fertilization occurs,
post-zygotic isolating

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.860
mechanisms basically have to do
with viability,

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.710
survival and fertility.
 

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:19.009
So hybrid inviability or
infertility is a common thing,

00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:23.230
once two species have diverged
to a certain extent.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.423
And of course the commonest one
that you're probably all

00:11:25.423 --> 00:11:28.187
familiar with is the mule;
the mule is a cross between a

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:30.629
donkey and a horse,
and mules are sterile.

00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:34.501
So hybridization between
donkeys and horses isn't going

00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:38.519
to go anywhere evolutionarily
because there are never any

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:39.808
grandchildren.
 

00:11:39.808 --> 00:11:45.374
I believe the same is true for
ligers, crosses between lions

00:11:45.374 --> 00:11:46.600
and tigers.
 

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.551
I'm getting nods from the
zoological aficionados in the

00:11:51.551 --> 00:11:52.558
audience.
 

00:11:52.558 --> 00:11:56.220
So thank you for the
confirmation.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:01.576
However, at this stage,
often fairly distantly related

00:12:01.576 --> 00:12:04.710
plants are able to hybridize.
 

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.894
It's usually not across the
boundaries of genera or

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:10.336
families,
but sometimes you can get

00:12:10.336 --> 00:12:13.889
plants from two genera
hybridizing with each other,

00:12:13.889 --> 00:12:17.606
which may be an indication that
the classification has been

00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:18.120
wrong.
 

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.783
But plants generally hybridize
a lot more easily than animals

00:12:23.783 --> 00:12:25.807
do,
and it may have something to do

00:12:25.807 --> 00:12:28.440
with the differences in their
developmental complexity.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.844
Usually the reasons for hybrid
inviability in animals are

00:12:33.844 --> 00:12:36.740
developmental abnormalities.
 

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.293
Okay, so I had signaled that we
were going to look at a

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:43.149
pre-zygotic example.
 

00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:47.000
So here is species separation
by pollinator recognition.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.783
Here are two columbine species,
and they can overlap

00:12:51.783 --> 00:12:53.379
geographically.
 

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:56.861
You'll notice that they really
have very different colors,

00:12:56.861 --> 00:13:00.528
and that is actually related to
the brains of the things that

00:13:00.528 --> 00:13:01.690
pollinate them.
 

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.279
Yes, moths do have brains.
 

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:04.259
Okay?
 

00:13:04.259 --> 00:13:09.267
So hummingbirds are notorious
among pollination biologists for

00:13:09.267 --> 00:13:13.951
loving red and yellow,
and if you see a white flower,

00:13:13.951 --> 00:13:17.418
you can normally--
it's a pretty good bet that

00:13:17.418 --> 00:13:20.620
it's going to be pollinated by a
moth or a bat.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:26.636
And in fact if you were to look
at these things in the

00:13:26.636 --> 00:13:30.176
ultraviolet,
you would probably see that

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:32.077
there were,
in the ultraviolet,

00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:35.548
interesting markings on them,
and often flowers that have

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:38.899
ultraviolet markings on them are
bee pollinated,

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:41.580
because bees see particularly
well in the ultraviolet.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.004
So these are two species that
are separated by pollinator

00:13:45.004 --> 00:13:47.113
behavior,
and I invite you to play

00:13:47.113 --> 00:13:50.546
through a scenario in your mind
of how their ancestor had the

00:13:50.546 --> 00:13:53.980
same color and then how they
might have gotten different.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.009
Okay?
 

00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:58.510
It would've been a gradual
step-wise process,

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:02.408
as they specialized on a
particular pollinator.

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:07.022
Okay, so species can be
separated by various mechanisms

00:14:07.022 --> 00:14:11.720
and at various stages in the
process of reproduction.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.149
Mayr gave us a biological
species concept;

00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:18.759
that's the biological species
concept, isolation.

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:20.940
And there are plenty of others
now.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.870
And I've put this list up here,
not for you to memorize,

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:29.436
but more or less--I do invite
you to go through and sample

00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:34.052
these species concepts--
but to show you that actually

00:14:34.052 --> 00:14:39.118
to try to state logically what
we mean when we say the word

00:14:39.118 --> 00:14:44.009
species has been a
difficult task for phylogenetic

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:48.355
biologists to deal with,
and the fact that I can put a

00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:51.750
list like this up there is a
measure of the difficulty,

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:55.259
and a measure of the
controversy and the disagreement

00:14:55.259 --> 00:14:57.690
that has occurred over this
issue.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:03.418
What each of these definitions
does is try to define a species

00:15:03.418 --> 00:15:08.490
from a slightly different
biological starting point.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:14.006
And what they're trying to do
essentially is get the most

00:15:14.006 --> 00:15:18.538
general and useful definition
that they can.

00:15:18.538 --> 00:15:21.649
And in some way they all fail,
which is kind of neat,

00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:23.460
because it means there's still
work to be done,

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.649
but in some way they're also
all partially correct.

00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:29.389
So I told you about Mayr's
concept.

00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:33.293
The recognition concept
basically is based on mating

00:15:33.293 --> 00:15:34.058
systems.
 

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:37.659
So species are things that will
decide to mate with each other;

00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:39.960
that's Hugh Patterson's.
 

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.346
The phylogenetic species
concept--there are various ways

00:15:43.346 --> 00:15:46.609
of looking at the Tree of Life
and deciding what on it

00:15:46.609 --> 00:15:48.210
constitutes a species.
 

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.236
So Joel Cracraft said it's a
cluster or organisms that are

00:15:51.236 --> 00:15:54.211
distinct from other such
clusters, within which there's a

00:15:54.211 --> 00:15:56.070
pattern of ancestry or descent.
 

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.342
So he says well essentially
it's the stuff that's out there

00:16:00.342 --> 00:16:03.288
at the tip, that's closely
associated.

00:16:03.288 --> 00:16:06.568
Back in '78 Wiley said that a
species is a lineage of

00:16:06.568 --> 00:16:10.351
ancestor-descent populations
that maintains its identity from

00:16:10.351 --> 00:16:14.261
other such lineages and has its
own evolutionary tendencies and

00:16:14.261 --> 00:16:15.649
historical fate.
 

00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:20.129
I don't know why he had to put
the last phrases in;

00:16:20.129 --> 00:16:21.740
it kind of messes up the idea a
little bit.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.033
But essentially if you're
looking at a phylogenetic tree,

00:16:25.033 --> 00:16:28.740
what he's saying is there's a
start and a finish on a branch.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.830
So it has duration through time;
that kind of thing.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:38.081
And then we'll come back to the
genetic cluster species concept,

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:41.500
which is one that Jim Mallet
put forth.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.654
Basically it says if you can
get a lot of genetic data on the

00:16:44.654 --> 00:16:47.940
things that you're looking at,
and you plot them out into gene

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.865
space somehow,
and you find that they form

00:16:49.865 --> 00:16:52.774
distinct clusters,
then each separate cluster is a

00:16:52.774 --> 00:16:53.980
separate species.
 

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.820
Now each of these is useful in
a somewhat different context.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.246
And, as I said,
I think that they all get at

00:17:01.246 --> 00:17:04.240
parts of what we mean when we
say the word species.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.733
And I don't want you to forget
the question I have hanging in

00:17:07.733 --> 00:17:11.519
the air, which is do we have to
make everything into a species?

00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:13.069
Okay?
 

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:16.568
So, concepts and criteria.
 

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:19.470
This I know looks a little
weird.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.980
Okay?
 

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.400
Why do they distinguish between
concepts and criteria?

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.890
Because after all criteria are
concepts.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:25.900
Okay?
 

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.708
This is because they were
trying to achieve kind of a

00:17:28.708 --> 00:17:31.298
local clarity in what they were
talking about.

00:17:31.298 --> 00:17:36.140
So the concepts are more or
less general statements about

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:41.240
how you might go about thinking
about what a species is,

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:47.188
and the criteria are rules of
thumb to decide whether a thing

00:17:47.188 --> 00:17:49.368
is a species or not.
 

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:52.758
So you can think of the
concepts as being abstract and

00:17:52.758 --> 00:17:54.740
the criteria being practical.
 

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.348
So we've got these concepts.
 

00:17:57.348 --> 00:18:02.493
And here are a few criteria
that could be applied to any

00:18:02.493 --> 00:18:03.430
concept.
 

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.970
So one would be,
why are the things separated?

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.578
Is there initial separation?
 

00:18:08.578 --> 00:18:11.685
And of course if we want to go
into it, we can look at the

00:18:11.685 --> 00:18:14.630
causes, but maybe the most
important thing is just that

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.318
they're separated,
not why.

00:18:16.318 --> 00:18:21.280
We can look at whether the
species is cohesive in some

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.950
sense;
there are different definitions

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.108
of cohesion, but one is,
is there genetic mixture?

00:18:27.108 --> 00:18:28.440
Are they breeding with each
other?

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.305
So cohesion has something to do
with the biological species

00:18:31.305 --> 00:18:31.798
concept.
 

00:18:31.798 --> 00:18:36.260
Another is, is that--are the
organisms in the populations

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.210
that we're looking at
monophyletic?

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.026
I'm going to come to the
definition of monophyly today,

00:18:42.026 --> 00:18:45.207
and I'm going to repeat it next
time, so that it gets hammered

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:46.250
in a little bit.
 

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.347
But basically that means do
they all share a common

00:18:50.347 --> 00:18:51.250
ancestor?
 

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.460
And then there's the issue of
distinguishability;

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.140
can we actually tell them apart?
 

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.147
Now when we get down to cryptic
species, at the end of the

00:19:00.147 --> 00:19:02.839
lecture, you'll see that they
are indistinguishable,

00:19:02.839 --> 00:19:04.528
except at the genetic level.
 

00:19:04.528 --> 00:19:07.588
We can't look at them and see
any difference.

00:19:07.588 --> 00:19:13.480
But for many things these will
be useful criteria.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.920
So, monophyly.
 

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.108
The things in monophyletic
groups share a common ancestor,

00:19:21.108 --> 00:19:25.460
and that common ancestor is not
the ancestor of any other group,

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.076
and there aren't any things
that are descended from that

00:19:29.076 --> 00:19:31.509
ancestor that aren't in this
group.

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:32.180
Okay?
 

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.868
So it's really everything that
came from that common ancestor.

00:19:34.868 --> 00:19:41.571
So birds all appear to have
shared a common ancestor that

00:19:41.571 --> 00:19:46.958
split off from basically a group
of dinosaurs,

00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:52.161
back in the Cretaceous;
possibly a little earlier,

00:19:52.161 --> 00:19:53.450
in the Jurassic.
 

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:59.650
Mammals all split off earlier
from a group of organisms whose

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:04.298
later descendents then included
the dinosaurs,

00:20:04.298 --> 00:20:08.950
but also many other things in
that grade.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.108
In contrast to a monophyletic
group,

00:20:12.108 --> 00:20:15.259
a paraphyletic group is a group
that doesn't contain all the

00:20:15.259 --> 00:20:18.515
things that are descended from
the most recent common ancestor

00:20:18.515 --> 00:20:19.529
of its members.
 

00:20:19.529 --> 00:20:19.970
Okay?
 

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.492
So yes, everything in here has
a common ancestor,

00:20:22.492 --> 00:20:25.541
but hey, there's some other
things that descended from that

00:20:25.541 --> 00:20:27.538
common ancestor that are out
here.

00:20:27.538 --> 00:20:31.022
So, for example,
if you call fish a natural

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:33.496
group,
you're making a mistake because

00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:36.670
the tetrapods are descended from
the same ancestors as the

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.509
ancestors of everything you want
to call a fish.

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:41.990
So the amphibians,
the reptiles--I'll come to the

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.420
reptiles in a minute
&gt;

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:49.380
--the birds and the mammals are
also things that we ought to

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.660
call fish--okay?--by that
definition.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:59.946
So we need a different word to
reflect the history of

00:20:59.946 --> 00:21:02.048
relationship.
 

00:21:02.048 --> 00:21:04.511
In the reptiles,
the birds and the mammals are

00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:05.059
missing.
 

00:21:05.059 --> 00:21:06.778
Okay?
 

00:21:06.778 --> 00:21:10.000
So if we say reptile,
and we want to really refer

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.454
accurately to a Tree of Life,
a good phylogenetic tree,

00:21:13.454 --> 00:21:15.700
then that word should actually
also mean,

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:20.200
oh, we mean the birds and the
mammals too.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.336
The thing that's going on here
is that our everyday language

00:21:24.336 --> 00:21:27.912
culturally evolved before our
scientific discoveries

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:32.400
demonstrated what the natural
relationships of groups were,

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.763
and therefore we have embedded
in our everyday language

00:21:35.763 --> 00:21:36.450
mistakes.
 

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:42.319
So that's why these
distinctions have been drawn.

00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:44.818
They are pointers to mistakes.
 

00:21:44.818 --> 00:21:47.112
So if somebody says
paraphyletic,

00:21:47.112 --> 00:21:49.190
it's like that's a mistake.
 

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:52.631
Then we have polyphyletic,
which is another kind of a

00:21:52.631 --> 00:21:54.425
mistake,
and a group is

00:21:54.425 --> 00:21:59.150
polyphyletic--the word referring
to that group is a mistake--

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.201
if the things in it are
descended from several ancestors

00:22:02.201 --> 00:22:05.586
that are also the ancestors of
things that are classified into

00:22:05.586 --> 00:22:06.528
other groups.
 

00:22:06.528 --> 00:22:10.128
So, for example,
all the stuff that Linniaeus

00:22:10.128 --> 00:22:13.319
called worms was highly
polyphyletic.

00:22:13.319 --> 00:22:14.588
It included the mollusks.
 

00:22:14.588 --> 00:22:22.098
It included therefore the
octopuses and the squid.

00:22:22.098 --> 00:22:27.097
If you were to refer to the Old
World Euphorbiaceae and the New

00:22:27.097 --> 00:22:29.704
World Cactaceae,
among the plants,

00:22:29.704 --> 00:22:33.250
as being in the same group
because they look the same,

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.838
you would be wrong,
because they both have--

00:22:35.838 --> 00:22:38.579
they're actually fairly
distantly related from each

00:22:38.579 --> 00:22:41.538
other and they have converged on
Cactus-like forms,

00:22:41.538 --> 00:22:45.181
and they have closest relatives
that don't look anything like a

00:22:45.181 --> 00:22:45.710
Cactus.
 

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:50.337
So if you ever make a group
like that, that would be

00:22:50.337 --> 00:22:51.700
polyphyletic.
 

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.440
Are there any questions about
these three distinctions,

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.280
or have I managed to get across
those differences clearly

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:57.839
enough?
 

00:22:57.839 --> 00:23:01.900
Because this is--it's important;
it's simple but it's important.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:07.083
Okay, species concepts and
criteria were reconciled by

00:23:07.083 --> 00:23:11.761
Kevin De Queiroz,
and basically what Kevin did

00:23:11.761 --> 00:23:17.109
was more or less arrive on a
scene where people had been

00:23:17.109 --> 00:23:22.068
embroiled in controversy over
species concepts,

00:23:22.068 --> 00:23:26.571
and he wanted to kind of stop
all of the squabbling about the

00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:30.699
concepts and try to move the
research on by more or less

00:23:30.699 --> 00:23:34.809
trying to resolve that,
and do so in a constructive way.

00:23:34.809 --> 00:23:35.910
He did a pretty good job.
 

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:39.954
Basically he said, "Hey,
let's see if we can agree--not

00:23:39.954 --> 00:23:42.929
everybody does--
but let's see if we can agree

00:23:42.929 --> 00:23:46.181
that species are entire
population level segments of

00:23:46.181 --> 00:23:47.799
lineages,
from origination to

00:23:47.799 --> 00:23:48.548
extinction."
 

00:23:48.548 --> 00:23:51.961
So they have duration in time,
and they're at the level of a

00:23:51.961 --> 00:23:55.200
population, and we could map
them onto a Tree of Life.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.548
And the criteria aren't the
same as concepts.

00:24:00.548 --> 00:24:03.661
Basically what they're doing is
they're marking stages in the

00:24:03.661 --> 00:24:06.346
existence of a species,
and they don't actually

00:24:06.346 --> 00:24:09.140
determine whether the species is
a species yet.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.088
Okay?
 

00:24:10.088 --> 00:24:12.999
Now, as we'll see,
if you actually go through

00:24:12.999 --> 00:24:16.240
what's going on as a species
starts to evolve,

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.416
on the Tree of Life,
and you mark off these species

00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:22.047
criteria,
I think you'll see that much of

00:24:22.047 --> 00:24:23.692
the time,
by the time you've stepped

00:24:23.692 --> 00:24:28.859
through all your criteria,
you have a good species.

00:24:28.859 --> 00:24:29.660
Okay.
 

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:30.099
What are they?
 

00:24:30.099 --> 00:24:32.308
Well there's separation.
 

00:24:32.308 --> 00:24:36.060
There's cohesion,
and the cohesion can be genetic

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.970
and caused by actual or
potential interbreeding.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:43.358
It can be cohesion of
recognition;

00:24:43.358 --> 00:24:47.431
so everybody who is a potential
mate can recognize each other as

00:24:47.431 --> 00:24:48.660
a potential mate.
 

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.769
It can be a cohesion of
viability and fertility.

00:24:51.769 --> 00:24:53.950
So there's post-zygotic
compatibility;

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:59.828
very important to include a lot
of plant species there.

00:24:59.828 --> 00:25:02.528
Then there can be ecological
cohesion.

00:25:02.528 --> 00:25:05.019
So these things are living in
the same habitat,

00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:09.500
at the same time,
behaving as an ecological unit,

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.422
and very probably doing so
because they are actually

00:25:13.422 --> 00:25:14.730
inter-breeding.
 

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:19.175
By the way, this business of
remaining separate,

00:25:19.175 --> 00:25:23.432
in the same place,
is a good criterion for two

00:25:23.432 --> 00:25:25.420
separate species.
 

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.769
So if you see two things that
are remaining separate,

00:25:28.769 --> 00:25:31.208
even though they are
continually running into each

00:25:31.208 --> 00:25:33.000
other in the same time and
place,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.597
then that's a pretty good
indication that they're separate

00:25:36.597 --> 00:25:37.230
species.
 

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.818
So another criterion is
monophyly;

00:25:39.818 --> 00:25:42.890
so they share a single most
recent common ancestor.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:46.757
And then you can distinguish
them either through fixed

00:25:46.757 --> 00:25:50.696
morphological differences or as
a phenotypic cluster in

00:25:50.696 --> 00:25:54.188
phenotype space--
this is a more quantitative

00:25:54.188 --> 00:25:57.452
thing than the quantum
differences of distinct

00:25:57.452 --> 00:26:00.270
morphology--
or they could be a genotypic

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:03.690
cluster,
in a genotype space.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:07.854
Now when you think--I'm now
going to lead up to a bit on the

00:26:07.854 --> 00:26:11.279
genetics of speciation,
and this slide is intended as a

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:14.592
transition into that,
and it is intended to show you

00:26:14.592 --> 00:26:19.000
basically that gene trees often
differ from population trees.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.596
So what's going to go on in a
speciation event is that you're

00:26:21.596 --> 00:26:24.194
coming along the Tree of Life
and there's going to be a split

00:26:24.194 --> 00:26:26.230
and there are going to be two
new branches.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:31.390
And these are entire
populations down here.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:32.490
Okay?
 

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.202
So you should think of each
branch down here as having

00:26:35.202 --> 00:26:36.788
thousands of organisms in it.
 

00:26:36.788 --> 00:26:41.381
And what these lines are
showing you is that there are

00:26:41.381 --> 00:26:46.146
splits in gene trees that can
start occurring before the

00:26:46.146 --> 00:26:49.974
population splits,
and that can continue to occur

00:26:49.974 --> 00:26:51.750
after the population splits.
 

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.183
And what we mean by a gene tree
split is actually a couple of

00:26:55.183 --> 00:26:56.098
possibilities.
 

00:26:56.098 --> 00:26:58.630
One is, okay,
a mutation occurs here at a

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.051
locus,
and we now have two different

00:27:01.051 --> 00:27:03.480
alleles that are in this
population,

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:08.746
and these two different alleles
then can continue to be

00:27:08.746 --> 00:27:14.068
maintained by various processes,
and one of them ends up going

00:27:14.068 --> 00:27:16.394
down this branch,
and then the descendents of

00:27:16.394 --> 00:27:17.990
this one end up going down this
branch.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.858
That's one possibility.
 

00:27:19.858 --> 00:27:22.590
Another possibility is,
oh, we have a gene duplication

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.660
even here;
so we now have two different

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.798
versions of the gene.
 

00:27:25.798 --> 00:27:28.210
They both are being used for
something.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:31.080
They're functional,
they don't become pseudo-genes

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.563
necessarily,
and the descendents of one

00:27:33.563 --> 00:27:37.323
copy--actually in that case you
ought to get both copies going

00:27:37.323 --> 00:27:40.529
down both branches of the gene
duplication event.

00:27:40.529 --> 00:27:43.568
So that would probably be more
like this.

00:27:43.568 --> 00:27:46.799
I suppose that it's conceivable
actually that you could lose a

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:49.130
copy and still have functional
organisms,

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:53.736
if the process of acquiring
function for the second copy was

00:27:53.736 --> 00:27:57.250
still going on in this region of
time here.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.000
At any rate,
the point here is that if you

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.667
look back to try to find the
last common ancestor of

00:28:05.667 --> 00:28:08.901
different genes,
or different alleles,

00:28:08.901 --> 00:28:12.461
it's quite possible that that
last common ancestor for the

00:28:12.461 --> 00:28:16.208
genes will be deeper in time
than the last common ancestor of

00:28:16.208 --> 00:28:18.698
the species;
and that's because species have

00:28:18.698 --> 00:28:19.390
lots of genes.
 

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.509
Okay?
 

00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:29.840
So if we look at that kind of
process, here is a separation

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:36.791
point where, after this,
each of these branches is going

00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:39.700
to be monophyletic.
 

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:44.700
At this point some of the genes
have become fixed.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.710
So by showing that this one is
gone over here--

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:51.460
that's just intended as a
symbol, an analogy,

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.470
to indicate that a gene has
become fixed--

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:57.321
and over here in this lineage
maybe some other one has become

00:28:57.321 --> 00:29:00.010
fixed,
and at that point genetically

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.558
these species are
distinguishable.

00:29:02.558 --> 00:29:06.523
You can tell them apart because
now one lineage has one version

00:29:06.523 --> 00:29:09.528
of a gene, and the other lineage
has another.

00:29:09.528 --> 00:29:13.567
Then as these genetic
differences accumulate,

00:29:13.567 --> 00:29:18.522
later in time they will be
reproductively isolated from

00:29:18.522 --> 00:29:19.900
each other.
 

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.862
If two individuals of the two
species did meet,

00:29:22.862 --> 00:29:26.338
they would not be able to have
viable grandchildren.

00:29:26.338 --> 00:29:30.012
And of course I've shown you
that that reproductive isolation

00:29:30.012 --> 00:29:32.338
can occur at three different
stages.

00:29:32.338 --> 00:29:37.048
It's likely that the sequence
in which reproductive isolation

00:29:37.048 --> 00:29:41.523
is acquired is actually the
reverse of the sequence that I

00:29:41.523 --> 00:29:42.779
laid it out.
 

00:29:42.779 --> 00:29:46.548
So it would be first
post-zygotic isolation;

00:29:46.548 --> 00:29:49.548
then post-fertilization
isolation;

00:29:49.548 --> 00:29:52.958
and then finally pre-zygotic
isolation, with recognition that

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:54.720
the two things are different.
 

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.019
Okay?
 

00:29:57.019 --> 00:30:01.894
And then finally up here,
no hybridization at all is

00:30:01.894 --> 00:30:06.769
possible and you have complete
genetic isolation.

00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:11.058
So you would think that this
might be--

00:30:11.058 --> 00:30:13.750
with reproductive isolation
that you wouldn't get any

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.692
hybrids,
but there could be a few

00:30:15.692 --> 00:30:18.555
mistakes, and so finally
complete gene exclusion is

00:30:18.555 --> 00:30:22.390
usually coming after what is in
practice reproductive isolation.

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:24.808
This is a bit imperfect.
 

00:30:24.808 --> 00:30:31.108
So if we look into the genome,
and this has been done best

00:30:31.108 --> 00:30:34.511
with Drosophila,
because it's such a good model

00:30:34.511 --> 00:30:35.933
organism--
and this is,

00:30:35.933 --> 00:30:39.400
if you want to go into this
kind of thing,

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.490
search under C.I. Wu,
that's Chung-I Wu;

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:43.818
he's at Chicago.
 

00:30:43.818 --> 00:30:49.137
And basically what Chung-I said
was that if we look across a

00:30:49.137 --> 00:30:53.107
genome--
okay, so you can think of A,

00:30:53.107 --> 00:30:58.150
B and C just being as markers
on the genome--

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:03.371
there's gene flow between two
populations at lots of places in

00:31:03.371 --> 00:31:08.250
the genome as speciation just is
starting to get going.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.230
Okay?
 

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.568
So at this stage we have
populations or races.

00:31:12.568 --> 00:31:15.288
They've got perhaps different
kinds of adaptations.

00:31:15.288 --> 00:31:19.085
There isn't any reproductive
isolation, and between these

00:31:19.085 --> 00:31:22.000
three loci there's lots of
recombination;

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.656
the three loci are actually
capable of moving back and

00:31:25.656 --> 00:31:26.210
forth.
 

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:28.490
So A and a can move back and
forth;

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.440
B and b, and so forth.
 

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:35.940
Then, in the second stage,
there starts to be some block

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:39.992
to gene exchange,
and here we are at a level

00:31:39.992 --> 00:31:45.048
where we're getting a transition
between a race and a species,

00:31:45.048 --> 00:31:46.633
or between a race and
sub-species, with some degree of

00:31:46.633 --> 00:31:48.731
reproductive isolation,
and at this stage the

00:31:48.731 --> 00:31:51.630
populations could fuse or they
could diverge.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:54.373
But these blocks here,
that you're seeing,

00:31:54.373 --> 00:31:58.253
are indicating portions of the
genome where there isn't any

00:31:58.253 --> 00:31:59.660
exchange anymore.
 

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.205
So the idea here is that the
origin of reproductive

00:32:03.205 --> 00:32:06.256
isolation, if you look at the
genetic level,

00:32:06.256 --> 00:32:09.288
is a gradual process;
it doesn't occur all at once.

00:32:09.288 --> 00:32:12.875
It starts in parts of the
genome, and it continues,

00:32:12.875 --> 00:32:16.821
and while it is developing,
there's some still some gene

00:32:16.821 --> 00:32:19.618
exchange going on,
at certain loci.

00:32:19.618 --> 00:32:23.086
And you might think--and I
think this is probably the

00:32:23.086 --> 00:32:25.834
case--
the parts where the exchange is

00:32:25.834 --> 00:32:30.118
still going on are the parts
that aren't having big impact on

00:32:30.118 --> 00:32:33.118
hybrid inviability or mate
recognition.

00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:38.488
The parts that are starting to
get frozen up are the parts that

00:32:38.488 --> 00:32:43.509
have to do with any of those
three levels of separation.

00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:48.135
So when reproductive isolation
is complete, then all of the

00:32:48.135 --> 00:32:50.368
genes are free to diverge.
 

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:54.390
So here the populations are
beyond the point where they

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:57.625
could fuse but--
and they're a good species--but

00:32:57.625 --> 00:33:00.990
there's a still little bit of
hybridization going on,

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.797
that you can pick up,
and here they're completely

00:33:03.797 --> 00:33:06.430
separated and there's no gene
flow anymore.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.578
Now Chung-I did this actually
with simulans,

00:33:09.578 --> 00:33:12.990
Drosophila simulans,
Drosophila mauritania,

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.880
and the two sexual races of
Drosophila melanagaster,

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.890
which are in Africa.
 

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:18.828
Okay?
 

00:33:18.828 --> 00:33:23.086
And he looked through the
genomes of these species to see

00:33:23.086 --> 00:33:27.568
at how many places were there
genes that were diverging,

00:33:27.568 --> 00:33:29.920
and what were those genes
coding for?

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.630
So the differences between the
two sexual races of Drosophila

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.999
melanagaster,
which are really quite recently

00:33:36.999 --> 00:33:40.682
separated--
we're talking perhaps 50 or

00:33:40.682 --> 00:33:47.279
100,00 years here--
are all in sexual behavior.

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:53.038
That's things like how fast
does the male vibrate his wings?

00:33:53.038 --> 00:33:57.068
And Stage 3,
which is about here,

00:33:57.068 --> 00:34:03.239
is between simulans and
mauritania, and here we're

00:34:03.239 --> 00:34:08.275
starting to get back maybe
500,000 years,

00:34:08.275 --> 00:34:13.862
something like that;
and here we're starting to pick

00:34:13.862 --> 00:34:17.963
up lots of sterility and
inviability or female sterility

00:34:17.963 --> 00:34:20.333
genes,
and changes in genital

00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:24.539
morphology so that lock/key
mechanisms are incompatible.

00:34:24.539 --> 00:34:29.550
And then finally when you get
this divergence here,

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.349
which is back at one to two
million years,

00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:35.119
basically you just see a lot
more genes in these categories;

00:34:35.119 --> 00:34:39.610
sterility and inviability
accumulate.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:43.989
So how does a new species
actually come into existence?

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:49.349
Well going from that rather
modern evolutionary genetics,

00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:53.460
back a bit to the arguments in
the '40s,

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:58.905
'50s and '60s over speciation,
a lot of that argument is about

00:34:58.905 --> 00:35:01.050
geographic speciation.
 

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:06.360
Darwin emphasized allopatric
speciation.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.476
Gulick, who worked on the
speciation of snails in Hawaii

00:35:10.476 --> 00:35:13.097
and Polynesia,
emphasized allopatric

00:35:13.097 --> 00:35:14.219
speciation.
 

00:35:14.219 --> 00:35:18.070
Sympatric and parapatric
speciation are things that came

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.960
in, in the '60s and '70s.
 

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.550
Allopatric means allo-patric,
different places;

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:31.960
sym-patric, same place;
para-patric, next to each other.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.811
And genetically,
as you've seen from Chung-I

00:35:34.811 --> 00:35:37.731
Wu's analysis,
initially there are only a few

00:35:37.731 --> 00:35:39.590
genes that are changing.
 

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.079
So even though you have 35,000
genes in the genome,

00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:45.690
speciation might be driven by
four or five,

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:49.510
and that's what might allow it
to occur fairly quickly.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:53.920
And then after reproductive
isolation, the changes in those

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.420
genes mean that all the others
will diverge.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:02.210
So a good criterion for a
species is,

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:04.766
as I told you,
they remain separate when

00:36:04.766 --> 00:36:08.833
they're living in the same place
and encountering each other at

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:11.260
the same place and the same
time.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:15.983
So let's take a look
schematically at what these

00:36:15.983 --> 00:36:17.289
terms mean.
 

00:36:17.289 --> 00:36:21.440
So in allopatric speciation you
have an original population.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:26.179
There's some geographic or
geological barrier that forms.

00:36:26.179 --> 00:36:29.010
They then start to diverge in
isolation--

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:31.389
so here they just start having
different colors--

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:35.311
and then after they might come
back together they won't breed

00:36:35.311 --> 00:36:37.224
again,
because they've diverged so

00:36:37.224 --> 00:36:37.518
much.
 

00:36:37.518 --> 00:36:41.045
So the classical large-scale
example of this is the ratite

00:36:41.045 --> 00:36:41.539
birds.
 

00:36:41.539 --> 00:36:43.619
Those are the flightless birds
of the Southern continents,

00:36:43.619 --> 00:36:45.460
and they include the Ostrich,
the Cassowary,

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.958
the Emu, the Kiwi,
the Elephant Bird of

00:36:47.958 --> 00:36:51.268
Madagascar,
the Moas of New Zealand.

00:36:51.268 --> 00:36:55.077
And arguably those are all
birds that originated from a

00:36:55.077 --> 00:36:57.900
common ancestor that was on
Gondwana,

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.699
and when Gondwana broke up
through plate tectonics,

00:37:00.699 --> 00:37:02.510
these just rode around on the
plates.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:04.949
They never flew and they never
swam.

00:37:04.949 --> 00:37:06.599
Okay?
 

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:11.009
So they were actually carried
on pieces of rock into different

00:37:11.009 --> 00:37:11.659
places.
 

00:37:11.659 --> 00:37:14.391
There are, by the way,
many other things that can form

00:37:14.391 --> 00:37:14.960
barriers.
 

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.907
Mountain ranges can go up,
and when they do,

00:37:17.907 --> 00:37:21.610
river basins can change,
drainage basins can change.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:28.360
Things can become
reproductively isolated when

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:35.860
they fly out to an oceanic
island, and so forth.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.920
Now parapatric speciation means
next door, right next door.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.811
So some individuals of a
population get up and they move

00:37:43.811 --> 00:37:46.289
and they just go right next
door.

00:37:46.289 --> 00:37:49.701
This is thought to have been
actually how the Galapagos

00:37:49.701 --> 00:37:52.860
finches might have speciated on
a single island.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.121
So some of them might have
simply gone up the mountain,

00:37:56.121 --> 00:37:58.539
while others stayed down on the
coast.

00:37:58.539 --> 00:38:01.760
That would be parapatric
speciation.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.719
It is also thought to have been
what has driven the speciation

00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:07.485
of frogs in the Eastern United
States, and is still in the

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:08.650
process of going on.
 

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.449
So, for example,
in the Leopard Frog,

00:38:10.449 --> 00:38:11.949
on the East Coast of the United
States,

00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:15.266
you can breed individuals from
Connecticut and New York and

00:38:15.266 --> 00:38:16.409
they do just fine.
 

00:38:16.409 --> 00:38:19.820
Now that frog has a range that
goes from Canada to Georgia,

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.818
and if you try to breed
individuals from Quebec with

00:38:22.818 --> 00:38:25.230
individuals from Georgia,
they won't.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.371
But all along the way you can
make the crosses,

00:38:28.371 --> 00:38:32.402
which means that it is possible
in principle for a gene from

00:38:32.402 --> 00:38:34.590
Quebec to end up in Georgia.
 

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:38.791
So according to the biological
species definition,

00:38:38.791 --> 00:38:42.735
it's a species,
but in fact it's in the process

00:38:42.735 --> 00:38:44.449
of splitting up.
 

00:38:44.449 --> 00:38:45.849
Okay?
 

00:38:45.849 --> 00:38:47.771
And by the way,
this pattern is something that

00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:49.780
got re-established after the
glaciers melted.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.603
So the frogs moved north,
and this pattern has gotten set

00:38:53.603 --> 00:38:56.130
up in the last 12,000 years,
about.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:59.409
Oh, I should go back and do
these guys.

00:38:59.409 --> 00:39:03.829
Okay, that's parapatric and
this is sympatric.

00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:07.338
Sympatric is particularly
interesting because the

00:39:07.338 --> 00:39:11.650
controversy over this was so
violent and it involved some of

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.260
Ernst Mayr's Ph.D.
 

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:20.840
students rebelling against Mayr;
so that was Guy Bush.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.373
And basically the idea behind
sympatric speciation is that

00:39:25.373 --> 00:39:29.800
it's possible for a population,
where all of the organisms are

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.360
living in the same general place
and encountering each other at

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.226
the same general times,
to split according to

00:39:36.226 --> 00:39:39.989
ecological processes that are
going on in that little area.

00:39:39.989 --> 00:39:46.083
The initial example was a fruit
fly that switched from living on

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:50.550
apples to living on cherries,
where the apple trees and the

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:52.630
cherry trees were all in the
same orchard,

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:58.050
And because the offspring were
imprinted on the smell of the

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:01.606
fruit in which they grew up,
when they grew up,

00:40:01.606 --> 00:40:03.449
they tended to go to that same
kind of fruit,

00:40:03.449 --> 00:40:06.360
and because mating took place
on the surface of the fruit,

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.594
they became reproductively
isolated and they started to

00:40:10.594 --> 00:40:11.380
diverge.
 

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:14.240
The name of this one is
Rhagoletis, and its sympatric

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.103
speciation has actually been
documented and followed,

00:40:17.103 --> 00:40:19.030
and it's occurring in Michigan.
 

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.179
You'll see later,
we have an example from fish in

00:40:22.179 --> 00:40:25.659
African lakes where it looks
like this is going on.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:34.918
Now pushing experimental
evolution from questions of

00:40:34.918 --> 00:40:40.710
microevolution into questions of
macroevolution is not easy,

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:43.759
because by definition
macroevolution describes

00:40:43.759 --> 00:40:47.960
phenomena that are taking place
over longer periods of time.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.818
Nevertheless,
there have been attempts to

00:40:50.818 --> 00:40:54.179
cause speciation to happen in
the laboratory.

00:40:54.179 --> 00:40:57.530
They have mostly been with
short-lived fruit flies,

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:01.152
and I'd just like to summarize
some of that experimental

00:41:01.152 --> 00:41:04.905
evidence so that you can see how
close people have come to

00:41:04.905 --> 00:41:08.659
actually being able to create
new species in the lab.

00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:13.250
If you do divergent selection
in allopatry--

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:16.634
so you split a population in
two and you don't let any gene

00:41:16.634 --> 00:41:19.978
flow occur between them,
and then you select strongly on

00:41:19.978 --> 00:41:22.659
one trait in one direction in
one population,

00:41:22.659 --> 00:41:24.460
and in the other direction in
the other--

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.338
you can actually cause
reproductive isolation to

00:41:27.338 --> 00:41:30.300
evolve;
you can do that in a couple of

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.989
hundred generations.
 

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:36.340
If you select them in the same
direction in allopatry,

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.639
that doesn't seem to work.
 

00:41:38.639 --> 00:41:42.646
If you destroy the hybrids,
when they are in sympatry,

00:41:42.646 --> 00:41:47.260
and you divergently select in
sympatry, that usually works.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:51.510
So you can start the speciation
process in the lab,

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:53.887
in sympatry,
by destroying any hybrids

00:41:53.887 --> 00:41:57.809
between the two things that
you're trying to make diverge,

00:41:57.809 --> 00:42:01.590
and selecting those two things
in different directions,

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.610
morphologically.
 

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.744
But if you divergently select
without destroying hybrids,

00:42:05.744 --> 00:42:07.199
that almost never works.
 

00:42:07.199 --> 00:42:08.949
Okay?
 

00:42:08.949 --> 00:42:12.114
So there is an experimental
biology of speciation,

00:42:12.114 --> 00:42:14.440
and there is a literature on
that.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.523
This is something that's
particularly been done in Spain,

00:42:17.523 --> 00:42:18.239
by the way.
 

00:42:18.239 --> 00:42:23.780
Now recently there has been
some recent evolutionary theory

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.940
on whether or not sympatric
speciation is possible,

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:32.840
and it does appear that it's
possible,

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.407
and it can occur rapidly if you
have divergent selection to

00:42:36.407 --> 00:42:39.211
different habitats,
and you couple that with

00:42:39.211 --> 00:42:42.300
preferential mating with your
own ecological type.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:46.960
So this kind of thinking has
mostly been applied to fish,

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.010
and it's been applied to
sticklebacks living in lakes in

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.847
British Columbia,
and it has been applied to

00:42:52.847 --> 00:42:55.239
cichlids living in lakes in
Africa.

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:58.420
Let's take a look at some
cichlids in Africa.

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:02.625
So here are two cichlids that
are recently derived from the

00:43:02.625 --> 00:43:06.539
same common ancestor and often
classified into the same

00:43:06.539 --> 00:43:07.409
species.
 

00:43:07.409 --> 00:43:08.340
They are Tilapia.
 

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.780
They're living in a lake in
Cameroon.

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:15.800
This is male size versus female
size, and so you can see that

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.820
there are basically two clusters
with a few intermediates.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.018
There are some little males and
females,

00:43:23.018 --> 00:43:25.179
and there are some big males
and females,

00:43:25.179 --> 00:43:29.822
and you tend to find the small
ones in deep water and the big

00:43:29.822 --> 00:43:31.679
ones in shallow water.
 

00:43:31.679 --> 00:43:34.061
And if you look at the
frequency with which you find

00:43:34.061 --> 00:43:37.047
them in deep and shallow,
you can see that you only get

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:40.121
the small ones in deep water,
and there are a few of the big

00:43:40.121 --> 00:43:42.737
ones in deep water,
but most of the big ones are in

00:43:42.737 --> 00:43:43.570
shallow water.
 

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:47.449
You'll notice--by the way,
it's darker in deeper water,

00:43:47.449 --> 00:43:50.315
and you'll notice that the ones
that are the small ones living

00:43:50.315 --> 00:43:52.760
in deeper water already are
evolving bigger eyes,

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.967
and there's starting to be some
reproductive isolation between

00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:57.518
these.
 

00:43:57.518 --> 00:44:01.378
So this is a circumstance in
which there is a different

00:44:01.378 --> 00:44:04.844
ecological habitat;
there are different foraging

00:44:04.844 --> 00:44:09.193
and sensory specializations that
are needed in the deep habitat

00:44:09.193 --> 00:44:11.369
than in the shallow habitat.
 

00:44:11.369 --> 00:44:14.050
These guys are probably feeding
on snails on the bottom,

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:16.880
and these are probably feeding
on plankton in mid-water.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.103
There is good reason for these
two not to cross,

00:44:20.103 --> 00:44:23.601
because the intermediate
phenotypes aren't nearly as

00:44:23.601 --> 00:44:26.338
good;
okay, they aren't ecologically

00:44:26.338 --> 00:44:30.362
as good, they don't perform as
well in eating snails or in

00:44:30.362 --> 00:44:32.340
foraging for zooplankton.
 

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.427
So that's sort of the classical
ecological speciation

00:44:35.427 --> 00:44:36.199
hypothesis.
 

00:44:36.199 --> 00:44:38.467
Dolph Schluter at British
Columbia has written a whole

00:44:38.467 --> 00:44:39.110
book on this.
 

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:42.454
There's a big literature on it,
and a lot of people are

00:44:42.454 --> 00:44:45.922
interested in the idea that
there could be some sympatric

00:44:45.922 --> 00:44:47.409
speciation going on.
 

00:44:47.409 --> 00:44:52.469
Now we saw that these species
criteria work fairly well for a

00:44:52.469 --> 00:44:56.253
certain range of organisms,
but then there's also the

00:44:56.253 --> 00:44:58.911
genotypic cluster thing,
and that really solves a

00:44:58.911 --> 00:45:01.280
problem with asexual and cryptic
species.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.280
So I'd like to just introduce
you to that issue.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.690
One context where it's useful
actually is with bacteria.

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:12.572
So here are a whole bunch of
bacteria that all live in the

00:45:12.572 --> 00:45:15.570
gut, enteric bacteria,
gut flora.

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:22.092
And these guys are all pretty
proficient at horizontal gene

00:45:22.092 --> 00:45:23.329
exchange.
 

00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:27.679
There's about 30% of their
genome that they exchange back

00:45:27.679 --> 00:45:29.958
and forth,
pretty freely,

00:45:29.958 --> 00:45:34.762
so that there's a lot of
recombination going on across

00:45:34.762 --> 00:45:37.119
most of this tree here.
 

00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:41.244
But the housekeeping genes of
these bacteria don't exchange

00:45:41.244 --> 00:45:42.880
horizontally so well.
 

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.422
There's a core group of genes,
and they are the genes that are

00:45:46.422 --> 00:45:49.501
responsible for energy
metabolism and the construction

00:45:49.501 --> 00:45:52.579
of ribosomes and cell walls and
stuff like that,

00:45:52.579 --> 00:45:58.173
that actually form a core that
doesn't participate in

00:45:58.173 --> 00:46:01.079
horizontal gene exchange.
 

00:46:01.079 --> 00:46:04.175
And if you just concentrate on
that core of genes,

00:46:04.175 --> 00:46:07.019
you get a perfectly good
phylogenetic tree.

00:46:07.019 --> 00:46:08.260
It forms a gene cluster.
 

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.677
If you include the 30% that are
being horizontally exchanged,

00:46:12.677 --> 00:46:15.179
the whole thing gets very
fuzzy.

00:46:15.179 --> 00:46:19.425
So that gene cluster definition
is good in bacteria,

00:46:19.425 --> 00:46:24.336
if you concentrate on the core
genes, which are housekeeping

00:46:24.336 --> 00:46:25.170
genes.
 

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:29.018
There is a radiation of
salamanders,

00:46:29.018 --> 00:46:31.349
Batrachoseps,
in California--well studied by

00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:35.768
Dave Wake's lab at Berkeley,
by the way--where there are a

00:46:35.768 --> 00:46:40.210
very large number of species and
local forms,

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:45.219
and many of these can only be
recognized if you look at gene

00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:46.239
sequences.
 

00:46:46.239 --> 00:46:50.550
So cryptic species are common
in some groups of salamanders.

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:56.539
Cryptic species are also common
in the algae that coral farm.

00:46:56.539 --> 00:47:01.996
So reef-building corals have
endosymbiotic commensile algae

00:47:01.996 --> 00:47:06.170
that they farm,
and the strain of algae and the

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:10.090
strain of coral have a lot of
cryptic diversity.

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:12.990
You look at it and you can't
tell the difference from the

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.510
outside.
 

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:16.190
There's a lot of diversity like
that, out there in the world.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:20.173
But this is really one of the
most interesting cases of a

00:47:20.173 --> 00:47:22.380
cryptic species,
Tetrahymena.

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:27.780
So this is a ciliate,
and there are ten

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:31.885
morphologically,
completely indistinguishable

00:47:31.885 --> 00:47:34.896
forms that had a last common
ancestor about a hundred million

00:47:34.896 --> 00:47:35.550
years ago.
 

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:37.719
So these things are a good
example of stasis.

00:47:37.719 --> 00:47:39.949
They still look exactly the
same.

00:47:39.949 --> 00:47:41.050
Okay?
 

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:45.559
However they have diverged a
tremendous amount in their DNA

00:47:45.559 --> 00:47:48.434
sequences,
and interestingly even though

00:47:48.434 --> 00:47:52.012
they look exactly the same,
the proteins that build those

00:47:52.012 --> 00:47:53.550
structures have diverged.
 

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:56.650
It's like there has been really
strong stabilizing selection to

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.550
keep those things looking the
same,

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:01.068
even though the genes,
and the proteins that build

00:48:01.068 --> 00:48:02.739
them,
have diverged.

00:48:02.739 --> 00:48:06.719
So that's deeply cryptic,
and there's things like that

00:48:06.719 --> 00:48:07.619
out there.
 

00:48:07.619 --> 00:48:09.469
So there are cryptic species.
 

00:48:09.469 --> 00:48:15.103
So first, evolutionary
biologists have come up with a

00:48:15.103 --> 00:48:19.219
bunch of different species
concepts.

00:48:19.219 --> 00:48:22.103
It's like the Hindu tale of the
blind man and the elephant,

00:48:22.103 --> 00:48:24.739
and one of them touches the
trunk, calls it a rope;

00:48:24.739 --> 00:48:27.599
one of them touches the leg,
calls it a tree.

00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:29.500
They're all coming from
slightly different perspectives;

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.940
they're emphasizing different
aspects of the process.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.715
What is helpful in thinking
about a species tree is that a

00:48:36.715 --> 00:48:40.360
species is a segment of a tree
from start to finish,

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.639
and if you're thinking about
gene genealogies,

00:48:43.639 --> 00:48:48.603
a species is a population that
is monophyletic and it is

00:48:48.603 --> 00:48:52.844
distinct from other similar
populations that are

00:48:52.844 --> 00:48:54.380
monophyletic.
 

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:58.300
The criteria you might want to
think about,

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.793
if you want to sit down and
logically distinguish two

00:49:00.793 --> 00:49:03.050
populations and call them
different species,

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:05.668
are separation,
cohesion, monophyly and

00:49:05.668 --> 00:49:08.139
diagnosibility--
can you really tell differences?

00:49:08.139 --> 00:49:10.420
And I've just shown
you--sometimes you can only see

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.199
the differences in the DNA
sequences.

00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:17.623
And these criteria do mark
stages in the divergence of

00:49:17.623 --> 00:49:18.750
lineages.
 

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:22.273
The genes that are involved in
speciation start off few in

00:49:22.273 --> 00:49:22.829
number.
 

00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:26.067
You might only need to be
influencing some aspect of

00:49:26.067 --> 00:49:29.304
hybrid inviability or some
aspect of mate choice and

00:49:29.304 --> 00:49:31.760
behavior;
perhaps just changing the

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.219
frequency of wing fluttering or
something like that.

00:49:35.219 --> 00:49:38.916
But then, over time,
the number of genes involved

00:49:38.916 --> 00:49:42.766
increase, and other kinds of
reproductive isolation

00:49:42.766 --> 00:49:44.460
mechanisms evolve.
 

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:48.659
And then there are these very
cryptic species that can only be

00:49:48.659 --> 00:49:51.760
distinguished as clusters in
genetic space.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.349
Now if you get interested in
this stuff,

00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:55.824
here's some--I've stuck this
in, so you'll have this for

00:49:55.824 --> 00:49:58.302
reference--
the January 20,2009 issue of

00:49:58.302 --> 00:50:02.630
Heredity has ten articles
on the genetics of speciation.

00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:06.599
Jerry Coyne and Allen Orr have
a good fairly recent book on

00:50:06.599 --> 00:50:07.489
speciation.
 

00:50:07.489 --> 00:50:08.963
You can also,
if you want to,

00:50:08.963 --> 00:50:11.018
search for Trevor Price,
Dolph Schluter,

00:50:11.018 --> 00:50:12.650
Sergey Gavrilets,
Ulf Dieckmann,

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:16.547
Michael Doebeli;
and you'll pick up books and

00:50:16.547 --> 00:50:19.969
papers on recent speciation
ideas.

00:50:19.969 --> 00:50:23.442
And next time we're going to
take this basic element of the

00:50:23.442 --> 00:50:26.777
Tree of Life,
which is the separation of the

00:50:26.777 --> 00:50:29.454
branches,
and start looking at

00:50:29.454 --> 00:50:31.800
phylogenetic systematics.

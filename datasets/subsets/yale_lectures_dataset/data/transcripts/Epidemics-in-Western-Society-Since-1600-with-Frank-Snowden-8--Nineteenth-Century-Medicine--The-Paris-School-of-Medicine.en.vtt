00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.308
Prof: Okay,
well good morning,

00:00:04.308 --> 00:00:06.170
and we can get underway.
 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.346
So far, as you know,
we've dealt with two major

00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:15.960
epidemic diseases,
plague and smallpox.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.941
And we'll be examining quite a
number more, beginning next time

00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:24.160
with Asiatic cholera.
 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.537
But our course,
as you remember I explained in

00:00:28.537 --> 00:00:32.330
the beginning,
isn't simply one epidemic

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.860
disease after another.
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.900
There are also other themes
that are very important to us.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.987
One of those is already taking
shape, I hope,

00:00:43.987 --> 00:00:48.167
in your minds and in your
section discussions,

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:53.370
and that is the history of
public health strategies;

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.888
that is, ways in which
societies organize to defend

00:00:57.888 --> 00:01:01.774
themselves against the
incursions that we're

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:03.130
discussing.
 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.578
We've noted the first form of
public health,

00:01:06.578 --> 00:01:11.010
which consisted of those
draconian plague measures,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.069
and we'll see that they aren't
confined only to bubonic plague,

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:21.870
but they'll be cropping up
again and again in the course of

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.370
our lectures.
 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.587
And you've also seen that
smallpox brought about a second

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:33.203
major style of public health,
and that is vaccination,

00:01:33.203 --> 00:01:36.470
and clearly we'll be returning
to that as well.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.709
So, public health is a major
theme of our class.

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:47.572
And a third major theme is also
crucial, and that's the history

00:01:47.572 --> 00:01:51.450
of ideas, and especially medical
ideas.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.483
So, we're examining--one way of
thinking about the course might

00:01:56.483 --> 00:02:01.109
be as an examination of the
career of what might be called

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:06.424
scientific medicine,
from humoralism through several

00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:12.109
subsequent incarnations,
down to the modern biomedical

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.120
paradigm.
 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.953
In later weeks we'll be looking
at the germ theory of disease,

00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:20.726
at the debate about
contagionism and

00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:22.470
anti-contagionism.
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.574
We'll be looking at the idea of
tropical medicine as a concept,

00:02:28.574 --> 00:02:30.840
and its implications.
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.792
But this morning I want to take
another step by looking at a

00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:42.441
very crucial moment in the
development of modern medicine

00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:45.723
that took place,
this development,

00:02:45.723 --> 00:02:49.897
between the French Revolution
and the middle of the nineteenth

00:02:49.897 --> 00:02:52.948
century,
and it occurred in Paris,

00:02:52.948 --> 00:02:58.120
and is universally known as the
Paris School of Medicine.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.806
This is a development that was
so important that sometimes it's

00:03:02.806 --> 00:03:07.104
referred to,
maybe just a shade glibly,

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:13.437
as the moment of transition
from medieval medicine to

00:03:13.437 --> 00:03:15.020
modernity.
 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.996
So, our plan this morning is to
look at this through first

00:03:21.996 --> 00:03:28.604
understanding major new
developments that were a series

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:36.560
of shocks to the old humoral
system of Hippocrates and Galen.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.240
We'll see firstly some crises
there.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.508
The second thing we'll need to
do is to look at positive

00:03:45.508 --> 00:03:48.770
precursors to the developments
of Paris.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.779
As is so often the case,
it's misleading to think of the

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:56.568
Paris School as suddenly
appearing out of nowhere.

00:03:56.568 --> 00:04:02.235
It had its bases intellectually
and institutionally in a series

00:04:02.235 --> 00:04:04.430
of prior developments.
 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.650
Those were preconditions that
made it possible.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.316
Then we'll look at what
actually happened in Paris,

00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:18.509
roughly in the period 1794 to
1848;

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:24.036
the establishment of a new
concept, a new embodiment of

00:04:24.036 --> 00:04:26.290
scientific medicine.
 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.833
And this is a step that laid
the preconditions for the germ

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:37.375
theory that came later in the
century, for reasons we'll be

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:38.810
discussing.
 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.007
And then the last thing we'll
do this morning is to look at

00:04:43.007 --> 00:04:46.048
the achievements,
but also the limitations,

00:04:46.048 --> 00:04:48.220
of what happened in Paris.
 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.968
Now, in our career in
scientific medicine,

00:04:52.968 --> 00:04:58.529
we've noted the first
embodiment in antiquity.

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:02.795
We've talked a bit about
Hippocrates and his

00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:08.351
establishment of the importance
of naturalistic causes of

00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:12.519
disease instead of magic
explanations;

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:15.089
the rejection,
if you like,

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:20.329
of religious or demonic
interpretations of disease.

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:26.043
In Hippocrates' hands,
disease was clearly a natural

00:05:26.043 --> 00:05:30.300
phenomenon with naturalistic
causes.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.387
We should remember that this
had an importance for medical

00:05:36.387 --> 00:05:37.990
epistemology.
 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.050
By epistemology,
I mean what do we know,

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.567
and how can we know it,
what's the basis of knowledge,

00:05:47.567 --> 00:05:50.170
what are its sources?
 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.476
We know that Hippocrates and
his corpus of writings

00:05:54.476 --> 00:05:59.216
established or embodied a
medical epistemology that held

00:05:59.216 --> 00:06:04.213
that knowledge in matters of
healing is derived from direct

00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:07.980
observation,
at the individual patient's

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.689
bedside.
 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:13.932
It's therefore often referred
to, as this first incarnation of

00:06:13.932 --> 00:06:17.800
a scientific medicine,
as bedside medicine.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.882
The locus, the source of
knowledge, is at the bedside,

00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:29.160
through empirical observation.
 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.031
We know too that this had as a
corollary an educational

00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:36.120
program.
 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.319
How do you learn medicine?
 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:43.891
You do so by apprenticeship to
doctors on their rounds to the

00:06:43.891 --> 00:06:49.370
domestic bedside where the
essential task was to observe.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:56.233
Then we saw another development
in scientific medicine,

00:06:56.233 --> 00:07:01.189
and this was in the form of
Galenism.

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:06.980
This is to say that humoralism
in Galen's writings was

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.569
primarily concerned with the
ancient texts,

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:17.579
texts that Galen considered
essentially infallible.

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:22.521
They were to be enhanced,
and he thought that he was the

00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:28.002
person ideally suited to do that
work, but they could never be

00:07:28.002 --> 00:07:29.350
overthrown.
 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:36.841
There was no possibility of a
conceptual paradigm shift,

00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:40.519
or conceptual revolution.
 

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:44.970
This was what was called
library medicine.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.644
In other words,
for Galen there was a new

00:07:48.644 --> 00:07:52.319
understanding of medical
epistemology.

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:56.841
Knowledge was derived from
considering the ancients,

00:07:56.841 --> 00:08:00.209
from a careful study of their
texts.

00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:03.588
So, it's textually based
medicine.

00:08:03.588 --> 00:08:08.000
And it had, of course,
an educational corollary.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.620
And indeed until 1794 in
France, for example,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:18.028
medical education consisted
primarily of lectures on the

00:08:18.028 --> 00:08:20.971
classics,
delivered in Latin,

00:08:20.971 --> 00:08:26.074
and of a program of reading the
ancients in the original

00:08:26.074 --> 00:08:27.278
languages.
 

00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:31.750
This, then, was library
medicine.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:38.293
The whole humoral system,
as we've been looking at it,

00:08:38.293 --> 00:08:45.580
underwent a series of shocks
and intellectual criticisms.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.970
It didn't seem to fit all of
the evidence that emerged.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.529
Let's look at a couple of these
shocks to the humoral system.

00:08:55.529 --> 00:09:00.282
One we've already mentioned,
and that was the great work of

00:09:00.282 --> 00:09:04.379
William Harvey and the
circulation of the blood.

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:09.182
Now, this meant Harvey's work,
although he didn't take the

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:15.735
step of rejecting Galenism,
nonetheless it's true that his

00:09:15.735 --> 00:09:22.947
work undermined Galen's anatomy,
and it undermined humoral

00:09:22.947 --> 00:09:24.220
physiology.
 

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:30.640
So, this was ultimately,
then--Harvey's discoveries were

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:36.830
incompatible with the medical
thinking of his time.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.759
We've mentioned also that the
chemical revolution,

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:45.272
the work of people like
Lavoisier, was extremely

00:09:45.272 --> 00:09:48.976
important,
and it was important in

00:09:48.976 --> 00:09:51.538
undermining humoralism.
 

00:09:51.538 --> 00:09:57.441
Because you know that the
humoral approach was based on a

00:09:57.441 --> 00:10:02.710
theory of the four elements or
the four humors,

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:09.240
essentially on Aristotelian
natural philosophy.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.113
Chemistry, however,
undermined the humoral

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:17.711
elements,
the four elements,

00:10:17.711 --> 00:10:24.470
and began to replace them with
a wholly different set,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.288
leading ultimately to the
periodic table.

00:10:27.288 --> 00:10:33.101
So, the whole basis of the four
elements comes to be undermined

00:10:33.101 --> 00:10:35.820
by the chemical revolution.
 

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:43.320
Indeed, there is a development
of what's called iatrochemistry,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.283
which is the view that health
is the balance of chemicals in

00:10:47.283 --> 00:10:50.097
the body,
and that healing consists

00:10:50.097 --> 00:10:54.355
primarily of finding the right
chemical to correct the

00:10:54.355 --> 00:10:55.399
imbalance.
 

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:57.957
So, medicine,
in this view,

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:01.500
becomes reduced more to
chemistry.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.450
An important figure in this is
Paracelsus,

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:11.394
who lived from 1493 to 1541,
and was known as "the

00:11:11.394 --> 00:11:16.706
Martin Luther of medicine,"
a Swiss healer and a rebel

00:11:16.706 --> 00:11:18.629
against Galenism.
 

00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:24.886
Indeed, he burned--he boasted
that he himself had burned the

00:11:24.886 --> 00:11:26.690
masters' texts.
 

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:31.378
He was a leading figure in the
development of iatrochemistry,

00:11:31.378 --> 00:11:35.519
which was particularly strong
in the Low Countries.

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:41.125
He introduced a number of
chemicals to medical science,

00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:45.070
such as zinc and laudanum,
or opium.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.466
Another shock to the system,
of course, was the spirit

00:11:49.466 --> 00:11:52.370
behind the scientific
revolution.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:57.649
The scientific revolution was
empirical.

00:11:57.649 --> 00:12:06.087
It was a democratic process,
and it rejected the cult of

00:12:06.087 --> 00:12:07.928
authority.
 

00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:13.471
Authority could be challenged
by anyone's observations and

00:12:13.471 --> 00:12:14.928
measurements.
 

00:12:14.928 --> 00:12:21.467
And this was ultimately
incompatible with Galen's system

00:12:21.467 --> 00:12:25.509
of worship of the Ancient texts.
 

00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:30.493
Then there was the experience
that we've been looking at the

00:12:30.493 --> 00:12:34.210
last couple of weeks of epidemic
diseases.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.138
Epidemic diseases created
problems for humoral

00:12:38.138 --> 00:12:39.710
interpretations.
 

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:48.008
How was it that so many people
in a single place and time had

00:12:48.008 --> 00:12:53.538
this marked imbalance in their
humors?

00:12:53.538 --> 00:13:00.066
And there came to be,
alongside the Galenic system,

00:13:00.066 --> 00:13:08.158
the idea of contagion instead,
which was a non-humoral idea.

00:13:08.158 --> 00:13:14.340
Indeed, Fracastoro developed
this strongly,

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:19.580
and it gained a wide purchase
in popular culture,

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:25.313
and the search came to be for
some agent responsible for

00:13:25.313 --> 00:13:29.562
epidemics,
not humors, but perhaps a

00:13:29.562 --> 00:13:30.720
chemical.
 

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:37.408
Even some people postulated
that it might be a living thing

00:13:37.408 --> 00:13:39.139
of some kind.
 

00:13:39.139 --> 00:13:46.520
All of these were severe
criticisms for the humoral

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.850
system.
 

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:54.452
But although Galenism then had
these loose threads,

00:13:54.452 --> 00:13:58.808
if we might say,
well before 1794,

00:13:58.808 --> 00:14:06.600
no consensus arose around an
alternative to replace it.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.388
We might make a distinction
between medical science also and

00:14:11.388 --> 00:14:15.904
medical practice;
that is, the scientific basis

00:14:15.904 --> 00:14:18.470
of Galenism was eroding.
 

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:22.240
But until indeed the late
nineteenth century,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.352
medical practice,
what physicians actually did at

00:14:26.352 --> 00:14:29.610
the bedside, remained
traditional.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.438
So, we see critiques of
Galenism abounding,

00:14:33.438 --> 00:14:36.629
chipping away at its
foundations.

00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:43.577
But there was no new medical
science that was robust enough

00:14:43.577 --> 00:14:47.769
to create a new medical
practice.

00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:53.124
Note also that when we talk
about the coming of the Paris

00:14:53.124 --> 00:14:58.668
School, a couple of things that
we won't be pointing to.

00:14:58.668 --> 00:15:04.697
This new revolution in medicine
that occurred in Paris was not

00:15:04.697 --> 00:15:10.230
based on some new development in
the natural sciences.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:15.399
It wasn't based on a
technological breakthrough.

00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:21.033
It wasn't based on some
path-breaking medical or

00:15:21.033 --> 00:15:23.788
scientific discovery.
 

00:15:23.788 --> 00:15:28.808
So, let's look now,
with that as the background,

00:15:28.808 --> 00:15:33.149
at this new incarnation of
medical science,

00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:37.813
the Paris School of Medicine,
which was a conceptual

00:15:37.813 --> 00:15:41.928
revolution in the understanding
of disease.

00:15:41.928 --> 00:15:45.610
It marked a transformation in
medical epistemology--

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:49.558
where is the source of medical
knowledge?--

00:15:49.558 --> 00:15:54.259
and also in medical education,
and it led to a new position

00:15:54.259 --> 00:15:57.500
for the regular physician in
society,

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.200
with new claims to authority,
in competition with various

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.453
competitors,
like homeopaths or members of

00:16:06.453 --> 00:16:08.830
various medical sects.
 

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:13.580
This new medicine comes to be
called hospital medicine.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.418
And there are a number of
classic studies,

00:16:16.418 --> 00:16:20.505
if you want to read further
about it, that you'll be glad to

00:16:20.505 --> 00:16:24.960
know aren't on the reading list;
which I'm not extending.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.856
But there are places that,
on a purely voluntary basis,

00:16:28.856 --> 00:16:32.610
I hope that you'll be going to
read more about it.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.490
One is the work of Erwin
Ackerknecht,

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.601
who's one of the founders of
the modern discipline of the

00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:44.649
history of medicine,
and he wrote a work Medicine

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:46.779
and the Paris Hospital.
 

00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:51.519
Or there's my colleague here at
Yale,

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:54.881
John Harley Warner,
who's written Against the

00:16:54.881 --> 00:17:00.035
Spirit of System,
which is a study in particular

00:17:00.035 --> 00:17:04.390
of American physicians and
students,

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:10.192
and their experiences as they
made a medical and intellectual

00:17:10.192 --> 00:17:12.318
pilgrimage to Paris.
 

00:17:12.318 --> 00:17:18.550
There's a famous book by Michel
Foucault called The Birth of

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:24.179
the Clinic, and I
will wish you luck with that

00:17:24.179 --> 00:17:26.190
particular work.
 

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.914
It's one of the classic studies
that everyone refers to with

00:17:30.914 --> 00:17:34.759
regard to the Paris School and
its importance.

00:17:34.759 --> 00:17:39.851
But let me just tell you
anecdotally that I've read it I

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.608
think four times.
 

00:17:41.608 --> 00:17:45.665
The first time I read it in
French and thought there was

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:48.098
something wrong with my French.
 

00:17:48.098 --> 00:17:51.742
So, I read it in English,
and decided there was something

00:17:51.742 --> 00:17:53.630
also wrong with my English.
 

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:57.734
And then my third and fourth
times I think I decided maybe

00:17:57.734 --> 00:18:00.759
there was something wrong with
Foucault.

00:18:00.759 --> 00:18:04.005
But I'll leave that for you to
judge and make your own

00:18:04.005 --> 00:18:04.740
decisions.
 

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.957
In any case,
it's one of the classics in the

00:18:07.957 --> 00:18:12.372
literature, and it covers the
ground we're dealing with this

00:18:12.372 --> 00:18:13.269
morning.
 

00:18:13.269 --> 00:18:18.880
Well, what were the sources of
this new medicine?

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:25.670
First, I would say there's an
institutional basis that made it

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:29.788
possible, and that is the
hospital.

00:18:29.788 --> 00:18:35.542
Hospitals already existed,
but not as places of treatment

00:18:35.542 --> 00:18:41.092
so much as safety nets or
dumping grounds for the aged,

00:18:41.092 --> 00:18:44.380
the incurable,
the orphaned.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.430
The Industrial Revolution and
urbanization,

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:52.779
however, radically increased
the numbers of patients,

00:18:52.779 --> 00:18:58.582
and the hospitals were often
associated with philanthropy and

00:18:58.582 --> 00:18:59.838
the church.
 

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:04.028
And Paris, the great center of
Western Europe,

00:19:04.028 --> 00:19:08.955
urban center of culture,
also became the locus for some

00:19:08.955 --> 00:19:14.430
of the most famous hospitals in
Europe: the H�tel-Dieu,

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.089
the Charit� and the Piti�,
that we'll be seeing in a

00:19:18.089 --> 00:19:18.690
moment.
 

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:23.430
And, so, for a second then I
think it's worth doing a little

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:28.170
bit--taking you for a moment on
a bit of medical tourism.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:33.470
And in doing so,
we go to the center of Paris,

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:40.078
here, when we see the location
of the H�tel-Dieu hospital,

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:45.068
here in the middle of the
Seine, on the Ile de la Cit�.

00:19:45.068 --> 00:19:51.401
The H�tel-Dieu was perhaps
the oldest hospital in the

00:19:51.401 --> 00:19:52.338
world.
 

00:19:52.338 --> 00:19:57.943
It had a history of providing
care on this very site ever

00:19:57.943 --> 00:20:03.548
since the seventh century,
and it was the largest general

00:20:03.548 --> 00:20:05.750
hospital in Paris.
 

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:10.921
And as you can see,
it's located at the very center

00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:12.369
of the city.
 

00:20:12.369 --> 00:20:16.339
This is its architectural plan.
 

00:20:16.339 --> 00:20:19.259
It was a very large structure.
 

00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:25.067
By the end of the old regime in
France, it had four great wards

00:20:25.067 --> 00:20:30.685
that could accommodate 4,000
patients, often sleeping several

00:20:30.685 --> 00:20:32.558
to a single bed.
 

00:20:32.558 --> 00:20:34.588
We can see another picture of
it.

00:20:34.588 --> 00:20:40.122
This is a picture of the
entrance to the church and the

00:20:40.122 --> 00:20:45.039
hospital, taken in 1871,
at the time of the Paris

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:46.269
Commune.
 

00:20:46.269 --> 00:20:49.900
And we can see its present-day
structure.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.058
This is the great courtyard of
the H�tel-Dieu.

00:20:53.058 --> 00:20:56.962
And I'm pointing it out to us
because it's impossible to

00:20:56.962 --> 00:21:00.511
understand the Paris School of
Medicine and the new

00:21:00.511 --> 00:21:04.982
understanding of medical science
without taking into account the

00:21:04.982 --> 00:21:09.171
great hospitals of Paris that
were its site and were crucial

00:21:09.171 --> 00:21:12.009
in the development of its ideas.
 

00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:17.071
This is the H�tel de la
Charit�, another one of the

00:21:17.071 --> 00:21:18.759
great hospitals.
 

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:27.278
And this is the Hospital de la
Piti�.

00:21:27.278 --> 00:21:32.932
So, the new hospitals become
places of instruction,

00:21:32.932 --> 00:21:39.150
under the control or auspices
of a centralized state.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.765
They're large,
and have an enormous array of

00:21:42.765 --> 00:21:46.463
patients, and they're
dedicated--and this was

00:21:46.463 --> 00:21:50.500
crucial--to furthering
scientific knowledge.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:55.372
Indeed, they're more dedicated
at this stage to furthering

00:21:55.372 --> 00:21:58.450
knowledge than to treating
people.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.760
Then there are--if that's an
institutional basis then,

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.641
the great hospitals--there are
also philosophical origins for

00:22:07.641 --> 00:22:09.348
the Paris School.
 

00:22:09.348 --> 00:22:15.201
The first is the Enlightenment,
with its questioning of

00:22:15.201 --> 00:22:19.970
authority, its skepticism,
its empiricism.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:25.990
And then I'd like to turn to
John Locke in particular,

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:30.910
the great figure from 1632 to
1704,

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:35.452
and his crucial work,
the essay "Considering

00:22:35.452 --> 00:22:39.048
Human Understanding,"
of 1690,

00:22:39.048 --> 00:22:43.221
which some people regard as so
important that they place it at

00:22:43.221 --> 00:22:47.598
the very beginning of the whole
movement of the Enlightenment.

00:22:47.598 --> 00:22:52.715
Well, Locke postulated,
as you already know,

00:22:52.715 --> 00:22:58.903
that the mind at birth was a
blank slate or tabula

00:22:58.903 --> 00:23:00.450
rasa.
 

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:06.880
And his idea was what's called
philosophic sensualism;

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:12.580
that is, that ideas and
knowledge gained by the mind are

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:18.489
not innate but are derived
entirely from sense impressions

00:23:18.489 --> 00:23:22.740
and reflections on those
impressions.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:27.538
This is the cover of the
"Essay Concerning Human

00:23:27.538 --> 00:23:29.568
Understanding."
 

00:23:29.568 --> 00:23:36.000
So, we have in Locke then a
radical idea of epistemology.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.143
The source of knowledge--hence
the word sensualism--is the five

00:23:42.143 --> 00:23:47.890
senses used to conduct a
rigorous examination of nature.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.176
Locke, also in his
epistemology,

00:23:50.176 --> 00:23:53.130
not only saw the source of
knowledge,

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:56.430
but set rigorous limits to what
we can know,

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.017
putting God,
for example,

00:23:58.017 --> 00:24:03.284
beyond the realm of knowledge,
and establishing rigorous steps

00:24:03.284 --> 00:24:08.259
for being certain of the things
that we can know.

00:24:08.259 --> 00:24:11.423
Then there's another very
important figure,

00:24:11.423 --> 00:24:14.961
and this is someone we've also
mentioned before,

00:24:14.961 --> 00:24:17.900
who's becoming an old friend to
us.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.920
This is Thomas Sydenham of the
seventeenth century,

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.758
who was in fact a close friend
of John Locke and is called

00:24:26.758 --> 00:24:29.900
variously the English
Hippocrates,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.750
the father of English medicine.
 

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:36.759
Well, Sydenham was politically
a radical.

00:24:36.759 --> 00:24:44.400
He was a Puritan,
a left-wing Protestant,

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.160
who rebelled against the Crown
in the Civil War in England,

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.415
and served, in fact,
as an officer in Cromwell's

00:24:53.415 --> 00:24:54.048
Army.
 

00:24:54.048 --> 00:24:58.130
He was also radical in his
medical ideas.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:04.076
His prescription for medical
practice was rooted in the idea

00:25:04.076 --> 00:25:05.690
of sensualism.
 

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:11.240
He called for a rigorous return
to observation of the patient,

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:17.632
and he himself called for the
idea of abandoning theory and

00:25:17.632 --> 00:25:21.818
all pre-established medical
systems.

00:25:21.818 --> 00:25:26.765
The advance of medical
knowledge would proceed by a

00:25:26.765 --> 00:25:30.818
systematic comparison of case by
case,

00:25:30.818 --> 00:25:37.114
setting aside the classics and
setting aside general system and

00:25:37.114 --> 00:25:38.838
general theory.
 

00:25:38.838 --> 00:25:45.160
Oddly, Sydenham did not wholly
reject humoral medicine.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.277
But his ideas,
in fact we could say,

00:25:48.277 --> 00:25:53.890
were--and his practice--were
still influenced by Hippocrates.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:58.397
But what he did was to suspend
ideas of general theory and

00:25:58.397 --> 00:26:03.144
return from the texts to direct
observation of the patient at

00:26:03.144 --> 00:26:04.410
the bedside.
 

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:10.009
In some sense he was skipping
over Galen and returning to

00:26:10.009 --> 00:26:11.410
Hippocrates.
 

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:16.144
He believed that the physician
should trust his own independent

00:26:16.144 --> 00:26:18.588
reasoning based on experience.
 

00:26:18.588 --> 00:26:23.210
He distrusted bookish learning
and university education--

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.548
although he himself had
attended Oxford--

00:26:26.548 --> 00:26:32.434
and in return he was scorned by
the medical and academic elite

00:26:32.434 --> 00:26:33.690
of his day.
 

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:39.450
Sydenham gave his attention
also to epidemic diseases.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:43.154
He studied smallpox,
malaria, tuberculosis and

00:26:43.154 --> 00:26:44.058
syphilis.
 

00:26:44.058 --> 00:26:49.305
Indeed, he would be a good
figure for talking about the

00:26:49.305 --> 00:26:55.520
impact that epidemic disease had
on the undermining of humoralism

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.990
and the rise of a new scientific
paradigm.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:04.700
He's known also for his work on
hysteria, and on gout,

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.700
from which he himself was a
great sufferer.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.701
In his work on malaria,
he also did something radically

00:27:12.701 --> 00:27:15.220
new,
of reaching the conclusion that

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.900
he was dealing not with a
humoral imbalance in general,

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:23.920
but rather with a specific
disease entity.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.432
Indeed, he thought he was one
of the harbingers of the idea

00:27:28.432 --> 00:27:31.778
that diseases are all specific
entities,

00:27:31.778 --> 00:27:36.711
rather than a single dyscrasia,
and he suggested that the time

00:27:36.711 --> 00:27:41.239
might come when they would be
classified in the manner of

00:27:41.239 --> 00:27:42.288
Linnaeus.
 

00:27:42.288 --> 00:27:45.893
He even wrote,
"All diseases ought to be

00:27:45.893 --> 00:27:49.170
reduced to certain determinate
kinds,

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:54.750
with the same exactness as we
see it done by botanic writers

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:58.250
in their treatises on
plants."

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:04.711
Sydenham also was new and
radical in sometimes embracing

00:28:04.711 --> 00:28:11.880
the idea of contagion in his
dealing with epidemic disease.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.385
He wrote, for example,
of the plague:

00:28:14.385 --> 00:28:17.519
"Besides the constitution
of the air,

00:28:17.519 --> 00:28:21.682
there must be another previous
circumstance to produce the

00:28:21.682 --> 00:28:25.623
plague;
namely the effluvia or seminum

00:28:25.623 --> 00:28:31.155
from an infected person,
either immediately by contact

00:28:31.155 --> 00:28:35.788
or immediately by some
pestilential matter conveyed

00:28:35.788 --> 00:28:38.660
from some other place."
 

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:44.920
So, we see here a radically
different idea.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.079
And he wrote a work,
a famous work,

00:28:48.079 --> 00:28:51.612
of 1676 called the
Observationes

00:28:51.612 --> 00:28:55.702
Medicae,
a revealing title stressing

00:28:55.702 --> 00:28:58.118
medical observation.
 

00:28:58.118 --> 00:29:01.415
Sydenham is famous for
introducing a number of

00:29:01.415 --> 00:29:03.980
practices into medicine,
as well.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.930
He popularized the use of
quinine for malaria.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.608
He introduced opium into his
practice.

00:29:10.608 --> 00:29:14.557
He used cooling drinks and
fresh air to treat fevers,

00:29:14.557 --> 00:29:18.428
rather than bloodletting,
and he introduced the cool

00:29:18.428 --> 00:29:21.920
regimen that we talked about for
smallpox.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.953
Often, he wrote,
the best advice he could give a

00:29:25.953 --> 00:29:29.130
physician was to do nothing at
all.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:34.932
There was another important
philosophical influence,

00:29:34.932 --> 00:29:38.915
and that's this man,
Pierre Cabanis,

00:29:38.915 --> 00:29:45.630
a French philosophe who
lived from 1757 to 1805.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:51.335
He was a physician,
a physiologist and medical

00:29:51.335 --> 00:29:53.108
philosopher.
 

00:29:53.108 --> 00:29:57.704
He was also an administrator of
the hospitals in Paris,

00:29:57.704 --> 00:30:01.960
and an early supporter of the
French Revolution.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.018
But the point I want to stress
today was that in terms of

00:30:06.018 --> 00:30:08.990
medical philosophy he was a
sensualist.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:13.478
He believed that all mental
processes are derived from the

00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:17.174
five senses,
and therefore in medicine the

00:30:17.174 --> 00:30:22.117
source of knowledge should not
be ancient texts but direct

00:30:22.117 --> 00:30:24.460
observation of patients.
 

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.997
So, that was--these series then
we've seen institutional

00:30:28.997 --> 00:30:32.048
foundations and philosophical
ones.

00:30:32.048 --> 00:30:38.760
I now want to look at a third
major foundation for the coming

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.459
of the Paris School,
and this is the French

00:30:43.459 --> 00:30:45.920
Revolution itself.
 

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.064
This is a famous painting of
Eug�ne Delacroix of

00:30:49.064 --> 00:30:51.759
"Liberty Leading the People
."

00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:53.980
You get the idea.
 

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.355
What I want to stress is a
general feature of the French

00:30:58.355 --> 00:31:02.403
Revolution,
that it was an opportunity to

00:31:02.403 --> 00:31:06.932
wipe the slate clean,
that it marked a radical new

00:31:06.932 --> 00:31:11.730
departure that facilitated
opposition to older authorities,

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:18.460
and in specific nature to
medical corporations.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:23.488
It was also a time of French
nationalism which urged on that

00:31:23.488 --> 00:31:28.431
instruction should take place no
longer in Latin but in the

00:31:28.431 --> 00:31:32.259
vernacular;
that is, in French.

00:31:32.259 --> 00:31:36.238
There are also some other
specific features that made the

00:31:36.238 --> 00:31:40.571
French Revolution an important
moment for the development of a

00:31:40.571 --> 00:31:41.779
new medicine.
 

00:31:41.779 --> 00:31:44.423
One was, of course,
that this was a time of

00:31:44.423 --> 00:31:48.440
continuous warfare--
from 1792, for a whole

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.527
generation, until 1815--
and therefore there was an

00:31:53.527 --> 00:31:57.721
urgent practical need for
physicians and for adequate

00:31:57.721 --> 00:31:58.769
hospitals.
 

00:31:58.769 --> 00:32:04.365
It was a time of reform in the
structure of medicine as a

00:32:04.365 --> 00:32:09.960
career and a profession,
and also of medical training.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.530
It was a time too,
during the French Revolution,

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.180
when the hospitals were
reformed, centralized.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.430
There was only one patient to a
bed.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:23.930
They were state-owned and
centralized.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:27.338
And the wards became
specialized--and this was

00:32:27.338 --> 00:32:31.278
crucial for the development of
new medical ideas--

00:32:31.278 --> 00:32:37.598
specialized according to the
type of patient being treated.

00:32:37.598 --> 00:32:43.391
These hospitals were no longer
devoted to hospice and orphanage

00:32:43.391 --> 00:32:48.529
care, but rather they became
scientific institutions.

00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:53.549
Patients were seen as having a
service to perform in the name

00:32:53.549 --> 00:32:57.400
of science and the advancement
of knowledge.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.617
Their bodies were made
radically accessible to

00:33:01.617 --> 00:33:05.576
physicians and students,
both in life,

00:33:05.576 --> 00:33:11.942
and very crucially also after
death in terms of post-mortem

00:33:11.942 --> 00:33:13.700
examinations.
 

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.920
Alive, the patient was a source
of knowledge,

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.703
as physicians conducted
physical examinations to study

00:33:20.703 --> 00:33:24.059
the signs and symptoms of
disease with rigor and

00:33:24.059 --> 00:33:25.058
precision.
 

00:33:25.058 --> 00:33:29.536
In death, their lesions were a
source of knowledge to

00:33:29.536 --> 00:33:33.323
pathologists,
to surgeons who practiced their

00:33:33.323 --> 00:33:37.798
techniques, and to anatomists
and physiologists.

00:33:37.798 --> 00:33:42.054
Well, the reform of medical
education meant that the locus

00:33:42.054 --> 00:33:45.711
of medicine was entirely
clinical and practical on

00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:47.130
hospital wards.
 

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:50.903
You were trained as a
physician, a medical student,

00:33:50.903 --> 00:33:54.298
for three years,
followed by an internship.

00:33:54.298 --> 00:33:59.583
And the Faculty of Medicine in
Paris now consisted of full-time

00:33:59.583 --> 00:34:03.930
professors, appointed by
competitive examination.

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:08.820
And the French Revolution was
important for its values,

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:14.184
stressing a meritocracy by the
encouragement of ability instead

00:34:14.184 --> 00:34:17.255
of privilege,
birth and cronyism,

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:22.760
and by a new democratic spirit
that provided a new dynamism and

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.070
a world of competition.
 

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:28.952
The new banners inscribed--the
new mottos of the medical

00:34:28.952 --> 00:34:32.340
profession were words such as
"reform,"

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.657
"progress,"
"observation"

00:34:35.657 --> 00:34:38.199
and "precision."
 

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:42.364
What, then--those are the
preconditions--what was the

00:34:42.364 --> 00:34:45.889
substance of the Paris School of
Medicine?

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:49.538
And here we see an
extraordinary development where

00:34:49.538 --> 00:34:53.559
one city becomes the world
center of a new medicine.

00:34:53.559 --> 00:34:57.327
Paris was dubbed "the
universal faculty of

00:34:57.327 --> 00:34:58.719
medicine."
 

00:34:58.719 --> 00:35:04.360
Its students and physicians
came from all over the world to

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.960
observe and to be trained in
Paris.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:12.382
Its work was concentrated in
the Latin Quarter,

00:35:12.382 --> 00:35:18.056
that became a sort of mecca for
scientists and students from

00:35:18.056 --> 00:35:19.500
everywhere.
 

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:23.413
Indeed, large numbers of
Americans made a pilgrimage to

00:35:23.413 --> 00:35:27.824
Paris to study with its masters,
to bring their ideas back to

00:35:27.824 --> 00:35:31.021
this country,
and to place themselves in a

00:35:31.021 --> 00:35:35.485
position to raise their fees
because of the prestige which

00:35:35.485 --> 00:35:39.400
went with the time spent on the
wards of Paris.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.210
So, in medicine,
the rise of the Paris clinic

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:48.059
was said to mark a time of
transition between the medical

00:35:48.059 --> 00:35:52.389
Middle Ages and the beginning of
a modern era.

00:35:52.389 --> 00:35:57.882
This was hospital medicine,
based on radical empiricism and

00:35:57.882 --> 00:36:00.630
opposed to abstract theory.
 

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:06.806
The great motto in Paris was
Peu lire et beaucoup

00:36:06.806 --> 00:36:11.409
voir, read little but see a
lot.

00:36:11.409 --> 00:36:15.239
The basis of knowledge was said
to be facts,

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:19.842
grouped into great facts,
with linkages established by

00:36:19.842 --> 00:36:23.871
statistics,
and no room for abstractions,

00:36:23.871 --> 00:36:29.010
apart from the facts and their
mathematical linking.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:32.650
This was observation-based
medicine.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:39.300
But it went beyond the medicine
of Hippocrates in that--

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.409
this is a picture of Ren�
Laennec,

00:36:42.409 --> 00:36:46.869
represented on a Paris ward,
and what he's doing is

00:36:46.869 --> 00:36:51.420
conducting a physical
examination of the patient.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.269
Laennec, in fact,
invented--he was famous for his

00:36:55.269 --> 00:36:58.719
studies of masses of tubercular
patients.

00:36:58.719 --> 00:37:02.393
It's important to know that
tuberculosis was rampant in

00:37:02.393 --> 00:37:06.768
nineteenth century Paris,
and Ren� Laennec had the

00:37:06.768 --> 00:37:12.275
opportunity to examine and treat
thousands of patients with

00:37:12.275 --> 00:37:15.726
tuberculosis,
which he himself contracted,

00:37:15.726 --> 00:37:19.650
and he died from it in the end,
at a young age.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:23.041
Well, he invented--and this is
the point I wanted to stress at

00:37:23.041 --> 00:37:26.369
the moment--
the stethoscope in 1816,

00:37:26.369 --> 00:37:32.530
so that the modern physical
examination became more one--

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:37.059
not just observing the patient,
but examining him or her,

00:37:37.059 --> 00:37:42.467
and the stethoscope became a
hallmark and symbol of the Paris

00:37:42.467 --> 00:37:43.280
School.
 

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.230
Indeed, it became a symbol in
nineteenth-century medicine.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:52.987
Here we see--this was the
monaural stethoscope of the type

00:37:52.987 --> 00:37:54.489
used by Laennec.
 

00:37:54.489 --> 00:37:58.402
It may have been important also
that he was a musician,

00:37:58.402 --> 00:38:02.387
and specifically a flutist,
and that may have influenced

00:38:02.387 --> 00:38:04.489
his method of proceeding.
 

00:38:04.489 --> 00:38:08.090
This is the precursor of what
is more familiar to us.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:13.989
He introduced the procedures of
oscillation and percussion.

00:38:13.989 --> 00:38:18.780
He tapped and listened to the
internal sounds of the body,

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.318
and he described them,
what he heard in the lungs of

00:38:23.318 --> 00:38:27.431
his tuberculosis patients,
as rales, rhonchi,

00:38:27.431 --> 00:38:32.286
and all the other modern terms
used to describe the modern

00:38:32.286 --> 00:38:34.329
sounds that he heard.
 

00:38:34.329 --> 00:38:38.092
Now, this vast number of
patients on the wards was

00:38:38.092 --> 00:38:38.860
crucial.
 

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:44.422
A professor of medicine in
Paris might examine some 5,000

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:46.210
patients a year.
 

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:50.307
And crucially,
they produced a new concept of

00:38:50.307 --> 00:38:53.710
disease;
that is, disease specificity.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:58.128
Diseases were thought to be
discrete entities that could be

00:38:58.128 --> 00:38:59.119
classified.
 

00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:03.396
This is the beginning really of
nosology, which is the

00:39:03.396 --> 00:39:07.592
classification of disease
entities, labeled variously

00:39:07.592 --> 00:39:10.659
tuberculosis,
smallpox, et cetera.

00:39:10.659 --> 00:39:15.860
Rather than the humoral idea
that there's just one disease,

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:19.550
the humoral imbalance or
dyscrasia,

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:25.739
now we have a Linnaean type
nosology or classification.

00:39:25.739 --> 00:39:28.780
On wards--and this was very
important--

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:35.646
another innovation of the Paris
School was that the symptoms

00:39:35.646 --> 00:39:40.880
observed on the ward,
after the patient died--if the

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.371
patient died,
and very many did--were

00:39:44.371 --> 00:39:49.902
correlated with the lesions in
organs and tissues seen in

00:39:49.902 --> 00:39:52.570
post-mortem examination.
 

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:59.155
So, an important part of Paris
then was the linking of medicine

00:39:59.155 --> 00:40:03.617
with pathology,
a physical examination with

00:40:03.617 --> 00:40:06.380
post-mortem autopsies.
 

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:11.936
There came to be another word
then associated with Paris--a

00:40:11.936 --> 00:40:15.769
couple of words:
localism, diseases had a

00:40:15.769 --> 00:40:21.809
particular location in the body;
solidism, which set them apart

00:40:21.809 --> 00:40:25.090
from the fluids that were the
humors.

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:30.826
Instead the location of
diseases was in solid organs and

00:40:30.826 --> 00:40:31.869
tissues.
 

00:40:31.869 --> 00:40:37.969
Now, the main diseases in Paris
at the time were pulmonary TB,

00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:41.268
pneumonia, typhoid,
heart disease,

00:40:41.268 --> 00:40:44.170
puerperal fever,
cholera.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:48.275
With these discrete entities
now being classified,

00:40:48.275 --> 00:40:52.130
we also see the rise of medical
specialties.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:56.492
So, Paris was important in
moving beyond the general

00:40:56.492 --> 00:41:00.342
practitioner to create
specialties of internal

00:41:00.342 --> 00:41:04.661
medicine,
psychiatry, geriatric medicine,

00:41:04.661 --> 00:41:08.353
pediatrics,
pathological anatomy,

00:41:08.353 --> 00:41:09.829
venereology.
 

00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:13.000
And there was a new notion of
medical education;

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.730
that is, lectures were still
given,

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:20.436
but the main place of learning
was the hospital ward where

00:41:20.436 --> 00:41:24.237
famous professors,
like Laennec himself,

00:41:24.237 --> 00:41:29.204
or Pierre Louis,
conducted their rounds with a

00:41:29.204 --> 00:41:31.518
retinue of hundreds.
 

00:41:31.518 --> 00:41:35.630
Then there was the autopsy
table, also in the hospital,

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:39.130
where observation and ideas,
based on the ward,

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.110
were confirmed or not.
 

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:45.650
The new medical education was
practical instruction,

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:50.101
and it was hands on,
with training on the ward from

00:41:50.101 --> 00:41:51.170
day one.
 

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.858
And the students who attended,
attended year round,

00:41:54.858 --> 00:41:58.253
with no vacation,
and there was a roll call for

00:41:58.253 --> 00:41:59.360
attendance.
 

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:04.489
Remember, this was introduced
at the time of the revolution

00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:06.789
and then under Napoleon.
 

00:42:06.789 --> 00:42:11.864
And under the Empire,
professors even had ranks and

00:42:11.864 --> 00:42:13.489
wore uniforms.
 

00:42:13.489 --> 00:42:17.030
So, the practitioners were
doctors.

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:20.985
But there was also a new
licensing system,

00:42:20.985 --> 00:42:26.583
and students were encouraged to
learn through their senses,

00:42:26.583 --> 00:42:30.539
through seeing,
hearing and touching.

00:42:30.539 --> 00:42:34.219
This was sensualism not only in
theory,

00:42:34.219 --> 00:42:37.849
but we might call it applied
sensualism,

00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:43.577
with a rejection of dogma,
of theory and of authority

00:42:43.577 --> 00:42:46.000
simply as authority.
 

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.583
Note too that there was not an
integration into this of the

00:42:51.583 --> 00:42:53.219
basic sciences.
 

00:42:53.219 --> 00:42:57.208
This was medical science in a
sense on its own,

00:42:57.208 --> 00:43:02.065
without what we would now--they
called the basic sciences

00:43:02.065 --> 00:43:04.059
accessory sciences.
 

00:43:04.059 --> 00:43:08.943
Now, the weak aspect of the
Paris School though was its

00:43:08.943 --> 00:43:10.300
therapeutics.
 

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:16.389
This was a medical revolution
in terms of medical science.

00:43:16.389 --> 00:43:22.170
It was less revolutionary in
terms of its therapeutics.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:25.784
The new understanding of
disease did not lead

00:43:25.784 --> 00:43:30.219
automatically to improved
treatment for the patient.

00:43:30.219 --> 00:43:34.327
Indeed, visitors from Britain
and the United States often

00:43:34.327 --> 00:43:37.994
expressed severe moral
reservations about what they

00:43:37.994 --> 00:43:41.150
observed going on in the Paris
clinics.

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:46.907
There was said to be little
concern to alleviate suffering

00:43:46.907 --> 00:43:49.130
or to preserve life.
 

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:54.159
Knowledge and its advancement
were what counted most.

00:43:54.159 --> 00:43:56.775
The patient,
some visitors said,

00:43:56.775 --> 00:44:02.090
was an object to be observed,
as in a Natural History museum;

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:05.980
more to serve science than to
recover.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.773
One American said,
in fact, that a French version

00:44:09.773 --> 00:44:13.882
of Uncle Tom's Cabin
ought to be written about

00:44:13.882 --> 00:44:17.360
hospital patients on the wards
of Paris.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:23.340
And Eug�ne Sue,
the Charles Dickens of France,

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.119
who wrote the famous work
The Mysteries of Paris,

00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:31.054
did a caricature of Pierre
Louis, one of the heroes of the

00:44:31.054 --> 00:44:35.670
Paris School,
who appears as Dr.***Griffon;

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:39.190
and in Dr. Griffon,
in the story,

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:44.969
tells his students on the
rounds, on the ward of the

00:44:44.969 --> 00:44:48.876
hospital,
that the lesions that they're

00:44:48.876 --> 00:44:52.648
observing--
that is, the symptoms--they can

00:44:52.648 --> 00:44:57.119
soon look forward to seeing when
the patient dies.

00:44:57.119 --> 00:45:02.391
Griffon declares that a patient
is a human sacrifice on the

00:45:02.391 --> 00:45:04.119
altar of science.
 

00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:08.887
So, the Paris clinic was also
sometimes described by visitors

00:45:08.887 --> 00:45:13.188
as a theater,
with patients as stage props,

00:45:13.188 --> 00:45:19.039
and where surgeons saw human
bodies as a means to greater

00:45:19.039 --> 00:45:21.130
manual dexterity.
 

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:25.657
Physicians and their students
were not taught that their

00:45:25.657 --> 00:45:30.679
primary mission was to heal,
but rather to advance science.

00:45:30.679 --> 00:45:37.110
Treatment remained what it had
been for a long time.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:44.465
Therapy--we can see one of the
lynchpins was still venous

00:45:44.465 --> 00:45:48.800
section or bleeding by leeches.
 

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.958
Here we see a picture,
very widespread on the Paris

00:45:52.958 --> 00:45:56.617
wards, where
hundreds-of-thousands of leeches

00:45:56.617 --> 00:46:00.360
were imported monthly by these
hospitals.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:05.166
And indeed they discovered
also, made a medical discovery,

00:46:05.166 --> 00:46:07.949
how do you get a leech to bite?
 

00:46:07.949 --> 00:46:10.280
Well, I can tell you the answer
to that.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:15.148
What you can do is you can wrap
the poor thing in a towel and

00:46:15.148 --> 00:46:18.150
soak the towel in wine or
vinegar,

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:22.713
which irritates it enormously
and makes it bite the next thing

00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:24.210
that it can reach.
 

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:29.911
So, the therapeutics then were
traditional and not different

00:46:29.911 --> 00:46:35.710
from what humoral physicians had
been doing for centuries.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:40.905
The strengths of the Paris
School were in diagnosis,

00:46:40.905 --> 00:46:45.900
pathology, classification,
surgery and anatomy.

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.650
Leading figures:
Laennec, Pierre Louis,

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.909
Pierre Cabanis,
Claude Bernard.

00:46:52.909 --> 00:46:58.849
But this stimulated imitation
in other countries.

00:46:58.849 --> 00:47:00.010
In England, St.
 

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:03.650
Thomas Hospitals and Guy's
Hospital in London;

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:07.684
in Austria, the Vienna School
of Medicine was directly

00:47:07.684 --> 00:47:10.539
influenced by Paris;
and in the U.S.,

00:47:10.539 --> 00:47:13.635
our own country,
the linking of the Harvard

00:47:13.635 --> 00:47:15.699
Medical School with Mass.
 

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:21.157
General Hospital was directly
based on the idea that had

00:47:21.157 --> 00:47:23.340
originated in Paris.
 

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:27.943
But by mid-century,
the dynamism of Paris was on

00:47:27.943 --> 00:47:33.820
the wane, and it had to do
particularly with therapeutics.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:37.070
There was a therapeutic
pessimism.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:41.518
All of the statistical methods
of the Paris School revealed

00:47:41.518 --> 00:47:46.199
that standard medical practices
were of doubtful efficacy,

00:47:46.199 --> 00:47:50.952
and tremendous advances in
medical knowledge had done

00:47:50.952 --> 00:47:53.969
little to advance therapeutics.
 

00:47:53.969 --> 00:47:59.750
Medical science and medical
practice were quite distinct.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:03.244
So, it's in the second half of
the nineteenth century that

00:48:03.244 --> 00:48:07.811
we'll be looking to yet,
very soon, another incarnation

00:48:07.811 --> 00:48:13.271
of scientific medicine,
when scientific medicine moves

00:48:13.271 --> 00:48:19.297
from France to Germany,
and from the hospital ward to

00:48:19.297 --> 00:48:23.880
the university and to the
laboratory.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.976
Then we'll see a new
epistemology that stresses the

00:48:27.976 --> 00:48:31.829
laboratory bench as the source
of knowledge,

00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:36.146
and we'll talk about the coming
of laboratory medicine and

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:39.480
experimental medicine as a
paradigm shift.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.400
But all of that would not have
been possible,

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.030
and we wouldn't have the coming
of the germ theory of disease,

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:50.369
if it hadn't been for the idea
of specificity and

00:48:50.369 --> 00:48:55.340
classification that were
developed in Paris between 1794

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:59.409
and the middle of the nineteenth
century.

00:48:59.409 --> 00:49:04.469
And next time we'll turn to
another epidemic disease--

00:49:04.469 --> 00:49:08.456
and this is a timely one as
we're moving into the nineteenth

00:49:08.456 --> 00:49:11.570
century--
and that is Asiatic cholera.

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:17.000

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.004
Professor Donald
Kagan: We have been looking

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:10.670
at the question of the rise of
the polis and the various

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.810
significant elements that were
part of the making of the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.021
polis,
and of course I've emphasized

00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:27.455
the notion of this new class of
people, the farmer hoplite

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:30.791
citizen,
as being the critical element

00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:34.659
in shaping the polis and
for my money that's what the

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.266
polis is about to start
with and then it develops

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.020
characteristics consistent with
that,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.560
and some that challenge that
over the centuries.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.253
But now, imagine that we are
living in the early years of a

00:00:49.253 --> 00:00:53.300
polis sometime in the
eighth century B.C.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.218
Again, I want to emphasize
these things that I've been

00:00:56.218 --> 00:00:59.686
describing don't happen in every
place at the same time and they

00:00:59.686 --> 00:01:02.439
don't even happen every place in
the same way,

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:06.826
but over a stretch of time the
concepts and the kind of

00:01:06.826 --> 00:01:11.376
characteristics I've been
describing appear to spread all

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:15.755
over the place.
But one of the ways in which we

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:21.062
can date the time when the
polis came into being has

00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:26.276
to do with the Greek traditions
about the establishment of

00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:30.759
colonies throughout the
Mediterranean inhabited by

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.454
Greeks,
and the reason that they are a

00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:37.833
clue is because every time we
see a colony,

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:43.041
learn anything at all about it,
it appears to exist in the form

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:46.867
of a polis,
which powerfully suggests that

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:50.693
that was the typical
characteristic style of life

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:54.679
that had already been
established for Greeks before

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.155
they sent out the colonies.
So, that's the chronological

00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:05.473
significance of it.
I should say all of these

00:02:05.473 --> 00:02:12.390
dates that I will be giving you
are some combination of Greek

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.154
tradition--and the Greeks dated
these colonies very

00:02:18.154 --> 00:02:22.439
specifically.
That would be hard to believe,

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.047
impossible to believe,
I guess, if it weren't that

00:02:26.047 --> 00:02:29.949
these dates tend to be confirmed
in a general way,

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.586
not in a specific way,
by the archaeological

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:36.970
discoveries that we find at the
sites,

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.900
the earliest places where these
colonies came into being.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.073
So it's that combination,
archaeology plus Greek

00:02:44.073 --> 00:02:47.449
tradition that lies behind the
date of any city.

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.961
But you shouldn't take the date
that I give you,

00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:53.800
the traditional date,
as being firm.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.893
It's a general thing;
it's around that time is the

00:02:56.893 --> 00:03:00.599
best we can really say.
The date that's sort of typical

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.385
for the general phenomenon of
colonization coming out of the

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:08.750
mother cities of Greece is again
that date we keep talking about,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.916
750 roughly.
But in fact,

00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:16.581
the earliest date according to
Greek tradition,

00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:21.387
if my memory is correct,
was something like 773 where

00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:25.671
the Greeks date the foundation
of what they thought was the

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:29.881
earliest colony they ever
established -- a place that they

00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:34.707
called Pithaecusa,
which is the island of Ischia

00:03:34.707 --> 00:03:38.824
in the Bay of Naples.
That's the very first place

00:03:38.824 --> 00:03:42.379
where there is a tradition of a
Greek colony having been

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.603
planted.
There's no question that there

00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:50.882
was a Greek colony there and as
I say the archaeological remains

00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:54.819
confirm the general time for
this happening.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.278
Now, the first question I
suppose, before I get to

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:03.400
describing what a colony was and
how it worked,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.091
we want to ask the question
what was it that led Greeks to

00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:12.885
sail or walk,
mostly to sail very great

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:16.779
distances from their mother
cities.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:22.611
To leave home and to establish
a new city for themselves

00:04:22.611 --> 00:04:27.699
someplace else is not to be
taken for granted.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.244
In the first place,
by and until the twentieth

00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:34.709
century, I guess,
human beings tended to stay

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:36.887
put.
They didn't move,

00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:39.889
unless they were driven to
move.

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.371
That was the natural thing to
do given the character of life,

00:04:43.371 --> 00:04:46.973
which was based upon farming,
if you leave you lose your

00:04:46.973 --> 00:04:50.790
farm, and based upon the
difficulty of transportation.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.867
In the Greek world we know--I
think I quoted something from

00:04:53.867 --> 00:04:56.240
Hesiod that confirmed it.
The Greeks were,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.649
even though they went to sea
plenty, they were terrified of

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:02.306
the sea for very good reason.
Their ships,

00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:04.699
their boats were not very
seaworthy;

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.199
storms come up in the
Mediterranean very suddenly and

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.128
terribly;
you take your life in your

00:05:10.128 --> 00:05:12.583
hands when you travel.
So then there's the whole

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:15.952
idea--we've already given you
some sense that the Greeks were

00:05:15.952 --> 00:05:19.279
ancestor worshippers.
I mean, they took special care

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.105
of the dead and they thought
that the way you buried people

00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:25.480
and so on was terribly
important.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.107
So, what I'm saying is,
when you leave the place you

00:05:29.107 --> 00:05:32.379
were born, you leave your
ancestors as well.

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:37.421
All of that means we need to
explain why these folks do what

00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:41.171
they end up doing,
and we have some hints,

00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:45.877
but of course we do not know
with any certainty or any

00:05:45.877 --> 00:05:49.824
confidence.
If you ask the question why

00:05:49.824 --> 00:05:55.145
did many Italians leave their
homes, especially south Italians

00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:59.420
in the late nineteenth century
and come--well,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.983
go all over the world actually,
to South America,

00:06:01.983 --> 00:06:05.080
Australia, but the largest
numbers to the United States.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.750
Why did they do that?
Well, we don't have to do a lot

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.136
of guessing.
We have written evidence from

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:15.939
the people who went and they say
why they did it.

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:18.206
We can then supplement that
with all sorts of other

00:06:18.206 --> 00:06:21.456
information that we have,
but we don't have any documents

00:06:21.456 --> 00:06:25.509
from some settler explaining why
he's going where he's going.

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.500
So, we have to reason from the
evidence that the establishment

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.550
gives us.
I suppose the most widely cited

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:42.110
reason is simply the desire to
acquire farmland.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.540
Remember, I keep emphasizing
this.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.462
The vast overwhelming majority
of people needed to farm land,

00:06:51.462 --> 00:06:55.935
in order to stay alive.
And why should there be a

00:06:55.935 --> 00:06:58.637
shortage of farmland?
One answer,

00:06:58.637 --> 00:07:02.139
and it's the one that is most
widely believed among Greek

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:04.452
scholars,
is that the growth of

00:07:04.452 --> 00:07:08.544
population that we have
mentioned in connection with the

00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:12.190
rise of the polis is
still working once the

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.761
polis comes into form.
So what this means,

00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:22.562
if you used to have two
children and now you have four,

00:07:22.562 --> 00:07:26.860
how do you provide for the
extra two?

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.701
Well, sometimes you divide up
the land equally,

00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:33.160
but if that land continues to
get smaller and smaller,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.837
it will not sustain an
additional person,

00:07:35.837 --> 00:07:38.180
not to mention additional
family.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.858
If you were to follow the
procedure, which the Greeks did

00:07:41.858 --> 00:07:45.166
not, of primogenitor,
that is, of giving the whole

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:48.759
plot to the eldest son,
but what happens to the others?

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:55.170
So that clearly is a problem
and the notion that land hunger

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:59.574
is a key explanation,
I think, is supported by the

00:07:59.574 --> 00:08:02.362
fact that wherever we find a
polis,

00:08:02.362 --> 00:08:05.149
whatever other characteristics
it has,

00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:09.071
and they vary,
some of them are located at

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:13.949
wonderful places on the sea for
trading purposes,

00:08:13.949 --> 00:08:19.114
some of them are not,
but all of them have a land

00:08:19.114 --> 00:08:24.817
supply which permits the
citizens to farm successfully

00:08:24.817 --> 00:08:30.089
and thereby to make the
polis succeed.

00:08:30.089 --> 00:08:34.139
But I don't think that's
the only answer.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:38.609
I think the desire for commerce
would have been also--I agree

00:08:38.609 --> 00:08:43.228
with the traditional view which
is that this would have been at

00:08:43.228 --> 00:08:47.539
a lesser consideration,
but still very important,

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:53.059
because we so often find that
the colony is placed right at a

00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:57.556
nifty place for trade.
They would have had to be damn

00:08:57.556 --> 00:09:01.510
fools to have settled there
without that being in their

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.870
minds,
although some of the places

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.210
where they settled leave us
puzzled, and have left the

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.764
ancients puzzled.
One of my favorite examples is

00:09:11.764 --> 00:09:16.705
the colony on the south shore of
the Bosporus,

00:09:16.705 --> 00:09:19.890
which is called Chalcedon.

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:26.928
It's right opposite
Constantinople--that doesn't

00:09:26.928 --> 00:09:29.602
exist, Istanbul.
Winston Churchill never,

00:09:29.602 --> 00:09:31.440
never conceded that it was
Istanbul;

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.110
he called it Constantinople
till the day he died.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.062
But right opposite that
magnificent site,

00:09:39.062 --> 00:09:43.753
the golden horn is there.
How could you possibly settle

00:09:43.753 --> 00:09:47.240
there, because they settled
Chalcedon first and the

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.217
tradition that the Greeks pass
on is the people who settle

00:09:51.217 --> 00:09:55.234
Chalcedon were blind men,
because you would have to be

00:09:55.234 --> 00:09:59.520
blind to make that choice.
Well, we don't know why they

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.580
did what they did.
So nonetheless,

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.216
the desire for a good
commercial opportunity might

00:10:06.216 --> 00:10:10.298
well have been one of the
elements that these people who

00:10:10.298 --> 00:10:13.490
were leaving their home cities
sought.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:19.129
Then there are less--what's the
word I want?

00:10:19.129 --> 00:10:22.913
Certainly things that have
nothing to do with economics

00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:27.047
really--there are politics going
on in these states as there

00:10:27.047 --> 00:10:29.919
always are in any Greek
polis.

00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:33.101
There are factions that grow up
for one reason or another and

00:10:33.101 --> 00:10:36.701
they come into conflict.
One side wins the argument and

00:10:36.701 --> 00:10:40.995
the battle, and sometimes the
ill will is so great that the

00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:45.659
losing side feels either that it
has to flee for its safety,

00:10:45.659 --> 00:10:49.527
or it chooses to flee rather
than to live under their

00:10:49.527 --> 00:10:52.640
opponents.
So, defeated political groups

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.234
might well--or individuals who
were the heads of those groups

00:10:57.234 --> 00:11:00.679
might decide they have to get
out of town.

00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:03.669
And now that we do have
something, namely,

00:11:03.669 --> 00:11:07.460
this wave of colonization,
they join that as well.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.500
Then there are always
things that we might call much

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.123
less rational than that.
In any group of people there is

00:11:16.123 --> 00:11:19.888
a small minority,
I want to emphasize small,

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:23.040
who just love to do risky
things.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.305
They just love adventure;
they're never happy if they're

00:11:27.305 --> 00:11:32.042
safe, and so off they go seeking
adventure and seeking to make a

00:11:32.042 --> 00:11:35.200
fortune however they're going to
do it,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.612
so I think that has to be
counted into the picture too,

00:11:38.612 --> 00:11:42.468
so typically I think it would
have been a small part of what's

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:45.152
going on.
So, for these reasons and

00:11:45.152 --> 00:11:49.100
probably for hundred more that I
haven't thought of,

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.841
we can understand why these
people go against the natural

00:11:53.841 --> 00:11:57.990
instinct of staying put and go
adventuring out,

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.580
seeking a new home someplace in
the Mediterranean.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.549
Okay, what are these new
settlements like?

00:12:06.549 --> 00:12:09.949
First thing is that they're
like each other in many

00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:12.532
important ways,
although obviously with

00:12:12.532 --> 00:12:16.781
differences from place to place.
But here's how it worked--by

00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:20.448
the way, the word I have been
using, colony is not a Greek

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:24.629
word and really not appropriate
for what the Greeks are up to.

00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:28.579
The Greek word for this is,
apoikia,

00:12:28.579 --> 00:12:32.716
and most literally it would
mean a home away,

00:12:32.716 --> 00:12:37.230
an away home and that's what
they're making.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.896
They are establishing for
themselves a household,

00:12:39.896 --> 00:12:42.396
a home someplace away from
where they started,

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:45.614
and that's the name.
Colony is a Latin word

00:12:45.614 --> 00:12:50.669
ultimately for colonia
and the Roman colonies were,

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:54.064
first of all,
garrisons that they planted in

00:12:54.064 --> 00:12:58.090
land they had conquered to keep
the people quiet.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:05.049
So, they would be alien bosses
in a different territory.

00:13:05.049 --> 00:13:08.252
And then later in history,
in Roman history,

00:13:08.252 --> 00:13:11.529
that was the name given to
establishments,

00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:16.983
rural establishments,
when the civilization was

00:13:16.983 --> 00:13:23.741
breaking down and the men who
worked on those rural places

00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:29.151
really were not free men.
They were the antecedents of

00:13:29.151 --> 00:13:33.305
the Serfs, which we will see
later on in medieval history in

00:13:33.305 --> 00:13:35.444
Europe.
So, when you see the word

00:13:35.444 --> 00:13:38.598
colonia in late Roman
history, it's talking about

00:13:38.598 --> 00:13:41.180
something very,
very different from what we're

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.259
talking about.
So, I use the word colony

00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:49.112
because that's what we have for
all such establishments of the

00:13:49.112 --> 00:13:52.873
kind we're talking about.
Remember that these are

00:13:52.873 --> 00:13:55.940
apoikiai from the Greek
point of view.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:01.690
Okay, how does an
apoikia happen?

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:08.095
Somebody in one of the old
Greek cities has to decide that

00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:13.039
he wants to go out and establish
a colony.

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:16.792
He would be an individual of
some eminence,

00:14:16.792 --> 00:14:21.796
because the job of doing this
requires that people should

00:14:21.796 --> 00:14:25.694
accept his leadership.
He will have to do the

00:14:25.694 --> 00:14:29.629
recruiting of people that come
with him on the colony;

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:33.370
he will have to do the
constitutional discussion and a

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.887
political discussion to gain the
sanction from the mother city to

00:14:37.887 --> 00:14:40.710
allow him to do everything he
knows.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:45.145
So, I think we should imagine
that these leaders of colonies,

00:14:45.145 --> 00:14:50.433
these founders of colonies,
would be probably noblemen and

00:14:50.433 --> 00:14:55.149
that they would have a position
of eminence,

00:14:55.149 --> 00:15:00.656
and yet unlikely to be part of
the sort of dominant faction in

00:15:00.656 --> 00:15:05.350
that city, because otherwise why
would they leave?

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.419
Anyway, the Greeks had a name
for this individual.

00:15:08.419 --> 00:15:11.720
He was called an
oikistes;

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.581
he is the found of the colony.
So, now he has decided to

00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:19.264
do it and he's gained
recognition from the town

00:15:19.264 --> 00:15:21.890
council, let's say,
and he can go forward.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.786
Now, he has to have an idea.
He can't just say,

00:15:27.786 --> 00:15:30.399
I think I'd like to found a
colony.

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:34.976
What is more typical,
I think, is that he thinks,

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:39.743
I would like to take and have
found a colony on the

00:15:39.743 --> 00:15:44.549
southeastern coast of Sicily.
Why?

00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:46.950
Because he knows something
about it;

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:51.735
either he has somehow traveled
out there himself and said,

00:15:51.735 --> 00:15:56.269
the place I'm thinking about
has a wonderful harbor,

00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:59.569
it has good farmland in the
neighborhood,

00:15:59.569 --> 00:16:04.188
and a critical element to
making this judgment is that it

00:16:04.188 --> 00:16:08.230
is not occupied by hostile
natives who will resist

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:12.604
vigorously your landing there.
Either there will be nobody

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:15.830
there or more likely there will
be not a very big population,

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.317
and it's not very tough,
and they could be easily

00:16:19.317 --> 00:16:22.317
brushed aside.
Those would have been some of

00:16:22.317 --> 00:16:25.486
the considerations,
and so what the oikistes

00:16:25.486 --> 00:16:29.352
does when he has picked out in
his own mind where he wanted to

00:16:29.352 --> 00:16:33.559
go,
next he goes to Delphi.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:38.259
Anybody--raise your hand if
you've been to Delphi.

00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:42.718
When you go to Greece do the
obvious, go where the tourists

00:16:42.718 --> 00:16:45.870
go and Delphi is one place not
to miss.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:50.676
It's halfway up Mount Parnassus
and it was thought by the Greeks

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:54.643
to be the omphalos,
the navel of the universe,

00:16:54.643 --> 00:16:57.740
the center in every way.
Why?

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:04.289
Because there the god Apollo
had established an oracle.

00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:11.455
There was a place in which from
the earth there came--it wasn't

00:17:11.455 --> 00:17:16.413
steam, what would it be?
Gases would escape through this

00:17:16.413 --> 00:17:20.003
gap in the earth and there when
things got figured out and

00:17:20.003 --> 00:17:21.930
arranged,
there were priests who

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.230
worshipped Apollo there and who
took care of this phenomenon.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:31.468
They would place a young woman
there who would sit as these

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:37.170
gases came up and she would
after a while begin to,

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.772
I suppose in the biblical
languages, she would speak in

00:17:40.772 --> 00:17:44.307
tongues, which is to say she
would rattle off a lot of

00:17:44.307 --> 00:17:48.509
language which nobody could
understand what she was saying.

00:17:48.509 --> 00:17:53.855
Gibberish, or so it sounded,
or Greek but making no sense to

00:17:53.855 --> 00:17:59.109
anybody, and then the priest
would listen to this stuff and

00:17:59.109 --> 00:18:03.091
he would say,
what Apollo said through the

00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:07.450
priestess here is,
and he would give the message.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:10.299
Let me just take a moment to
tell you about this.

00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:14.459
I say this now with great
confidence but ten years ago

00:18:14.459 --> 00:18:18.069
this story, which all the Greeks
agreed too,

00:18:18.069 --> 00:18:20.863
agreed upon in every respect,
that the temple of Apollo was

00:18:20.863 --> 00:18:24.142
built right on top of this,
and underneath the floor of the

00:18:24.142 --> 00:18:27.359
temple was this little room
where the gases came up,

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:29.720
where the priestess sat,
where all of this came up.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.634
Well, archaeologists
investigated this carefully,

00:18:32.634 --> 00:18:35.488
and the French School of
Archaeology late in the

00:18:35.488 --> 00:18:38.767
nineteenth century dug
everything up and concluded this

00:18:38.767 --> 00:18:40.970
was baloney;
it was a myth.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:45.402
There were no gases coming up
from any of this stuff,

00:18:45.402 --> 00:18:49.579
and so everybody believed for
the next century,

00:18:49.579 --> 00:18:54.467
and then a young man who once
sat in one of the chairs--not in

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:58.427
this room maybe,
but in which you're sitting,

00:18:58.427 --> 00:19:02.833
John Hale of the Yale Class of
1973, who is now an

00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:07.240
archaeologist at the University
of Louisville.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.840
Having learned,
or having agreed,

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.880
let's say, with my prejudice,
that the higher naiveté

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.453
must reign--and if the Greeks
said it happened,

00:19:17.453 --> 00:19:20.865
you got to believe it happened,
until you have to believe that

00:19:20.865 --> 00:19:23.821
it didn't happen.
And so he decided to

00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:28.988
investigate this and he took
with him a fine geologist from

00:19:28.988 --> 00:19:34.154
Wesleyan just to go to the place
there at Delphi and to see

00:19:34.154 --> 00:19:39.410
whether it could be true that
such gases did come out,

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.248
and what sort of gases they
were, and what consequences they

00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:46.761
would have, and you know I
wouldn't be telling you this

00:19:46.761 --> 00:19:50.534
story if it hadn't turned out
that they discovered evidence

00:19:50.534 --> 00:19:52.171
that,
in my judgment,

00:19:52.171 --> 00:19:55.241
but I don't think really
anybody doubts it anymore,

00:19:55.241 --> 00:19:57.819
that totally confirmed the
Greek story.

00:19:57.819 --> 00:20:01.303
They tell you precisely what
the gases were,

00:20:01.303 --> 00:20:05.109
what the characteristics of
those gases were,

00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:10.712
and it squared beautifully with
all details that we heard about

00:20:10.712 --> 00:20:14.971
the Delphic Oracle.
So, here's just one more case

00:20:14.971 --> 00:20:18.799
where Yale helped to straighten
out the world,

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:22.306
but you notice it wasn't done
by a Yale faculty member,

00:20:22.306 --> 00:20:24.579
we engage in confusing the
world,

00:20:24.579 --> 00:20:29.451
but our alumni do a much better
job and that's what happened

00:20:29.451 --> 00:20:32.755
here.
So, you go to the oracle

00:20:32.755 --> 00:20:37.379
and what do you ask the oracle?
Well now, before we go any

00:20:37.379 --> 00:20:40.339
further--in your Herodotus
readings and elsewhere,

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:44.182
you will come across many a
story in which an oracle is

00:20:44.182 --> 00:20:48.906
consulted and gives an answer.
Well, the most famous early on,

00:20:48.906 --> 00:20:53.089
King Croesus of Lydia,
the richest man in the world,

00:20:53.089 --> 00:20:55.681
you've heard all about him,
decides it would be a nice

00:20:55.681 --> 00:20:57.540
thing to conquer the Persian
Empire,

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.433
his neighbor to the east.
So, he goes to--he's a

00:21:00.433 --> 00:21:03.633
barbarian, but the barbarians
came to the Delphic Oracle too,

00:21:03.633 --> 00:21:06.140
because you want to know what
the gods want.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.537
So, he came and he asked.
He said, "If I cross the Halys

00:21:10.537 --> 00:21:15.292
River, that's the boundary
between Lydia and Persia,

00:21:15.292 --> 00:21:18.875
what will happen?"
The oracle replied,

00:21:18.875 --> 00:21:23.323
"A great empire will be
destroyed," and Croesus said,

00:21:23.323 --> 00:21:26.829
"Terrific that's what I have in
mind."

00:21:26.829 --> 00:21:30.729
He invaded and he was
clobbered, and then you read the

00:21:30.729 --> 00:21:34.849
splendid story Herodotus tells
of how he was captured.

00:21:34.849 --> 00:21:38.860
He was up on a pyre,
and he was going to be burned

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.971
when he remembered Solon,
the Greek, who had come to him

00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:46.140
and warned him about the vain
glory, and he said,

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.621
oh Solon, oh Solon.
I guess Apollo must have then

00:21:49.621 --> 00:21:53.880
said, he's reached wisdom and so
he sent a rainstorm to put the

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.490
fire out and he lived through
that.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:00.313
Well okay,
the point is the oracle was

00:22:00.313 --> 00:22:02.839
wrong.
No, of course not.

00:22:02.839 --> 00:22:04.869
We all know what was wrong with
Croesus.

00:22:04.869 --> 00:22:08.300
He should have asked another
question, which empire?

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:12.208
But he didn't think of it;
other times all kinds of funny

00:22:12.208 --> 00:22:16.014
stories are told about the
oracle, which would suggest that

00:22:16.014 --> 00:22:19.819
it wasn't really a very reliable
source of information,

00:22:19.819 --> 00:22:22.278
that it was filled with
mythology and so on and so

00:22:22.278 --> 00:22:24.299
forth.
But here is the hard headed

00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:26.318
fact.
We know for sure Greeks and

00:22:26.318 --> 00:22:30.066
barbarians, and everybody came
to Delphi, and when you came to

00:22:30.066 --> 00:22:33.200
Delphi and you were going to
consult the oracle,

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.121
it was hard,
there were a lot of people,

00:22:35.121 --> 00:22:37.289
a long line,
so there was a waiting issue.

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:42.144
But also people used to bribe
the priests, in order to get

00:22:42.144 --> 00:22:46.963
moved up on the front on line,
and they would also give great

00:22:46.963 --> 00:22:51.150
and beautiful gifts to the
temple people and to the temple,

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.726
and to the priest.
In other words,

00:22:53.726 --> 00:22:57.589
people spent a lot of money to
consult the oracle.

00:22:57.589 --> 00:23:00.151
Now, ask yourself this,
especially if you're talking

00:23:00.151 --> 00:23:02.361
about Greeks,
are they going to keep shelling

00:23:02.361 --> 00:23:05.375
out money for an oracle that
gives them answers that turn out

00:23:05.375 --> 00:23:07.390
to be wrong?
No.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:12.046
Most of the things they
asked were questions that really

00:23:12.046 --> 00:23:15.986
had a yes or no answer,
and according to my thinking,

00:23:15.986 --> 00:23:19.579
there's no way they could have
been wrong very much.

00:23:19.579 --> 00:23:24.800
I think the oracle probably
gained its fame for being very

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.829
good precisely at answering this
question.

00:23:28.829 --> 00:23:33.180
The question would have been
what will happen if I go and try

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.661
to settle a colony at the place
which I will call

00:23:36.661 --> 00:23:41.084
Syracuse--that's what I've been
describing on the southeastern

00:23:41.084 --> 00:23:44.447
coast of Sicily.
The answer would come and the

00:23:44.447 --> 00:23:47.738
priests would give a response
that would be essentially

00:23:47.738 --> 00:23:49.821
straight.
It would either say something

00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:52.617
like--I'm not going to do the
words that they would have come

00:23:52.617 --> 00:23:55.112
up with,
but they would have said,

00:23:55.112 --> 00:23:58.840
yeah that's a good place to go
or don't do that,

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.155
that's a terrible mistake.
Now, why would they be able to

00:24:03.155 --> 00:24:05.881
do that?
Because at some point in here,

00:24:05.881 --> 00:24:09.560
Delphi really did become the
navel of the universe;

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.075
everybody came.
Now, you can bet when these

00:24:12.075 --> 00:24:14.027
folks came and consulted the
priest and said,

00:24:14.027 --> 00:24:15.980
could you please put us down on
the list,

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.031
we want to consult the oracle,
the priest said sure have a

00:24:19.031 --> 00:24:21.120
beer, let's talk about your
hometown,

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.496
what's going on out there.
What I'm suggesting to you is

00:24:24.496 --> 00:24:27.636
that this was the best
information gathering and

00:24:27.636 --> 00:24:31.509
storing device that existed in
the Mediterranean world.

00:24:31.509 --> 00:24:36.703
These people knew more than
anybody else about these things,

00:24:36.703 --> 00:24:42.250
and so consulting that oracle
was a very rational act indeed.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:45.035
Okay, now suppose you are the
oikistes,

00:24:45.035 --> 00:24:48.750
you've gotten the permission
from your city to go forward,

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:52.327
and you go to the Delphic
Oracle and the Delphic Oracle

00:24:52.327 --> 00:24:56.269
says fine, by all means,
go where you want to go.

00:24:56.269 --> 00:25:01.033
Next thing, you got to go home
and you have to write up what

00:25:01.033 --> 00:25:05.069
amounts to a charter of
foundation for the city,

00:25:05.069 --> 00:25:09.065
which lays out how things are
going to work in this

00:25:09.065 --> 00:25:13.140
city--something about the
governmental structure,

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:17.060
maybe even more fundamentally
how the land will be allotted,

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.710
assigned, divided,
and so on so that when you go

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:24.630
to recruit settlers,
everybody will know what he's

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:29.990
getting and will decide whether
it's a good idea for him or not.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:35.478
Now, recruiting is
tremendously important because

00:25:35.478 --> 00:25:41.388
you need to have a certain
number of settlers to make the

00:25:41.388 --> 00:25:45.426
settlement viable.
You may not run into an

00:25:45.426 --> 00:25:49.980
enormously powerful collection
of natives, but you're going to

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.631
get some kind of trouble.
It's foolish for you to assume

00:25:53.631 --> 00:25:56.130
you're not going to have any
problem out there.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.902
So you need a certain number of
people just for defense

00:25:58.902 --> 00:26:02.035
purposes, but beyond that you
need to have a certain number of

00:26:02.035 --> 00:26:04.705
people to carry out all the
functions that need to be

00:26:04.705 --> 00:26:07.170
carried out for a successful
polis.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:11.889
So however many that is,
that is what you try to recruit

00:26:11.889 --> 00:26:16.694
and you recruit typically at a
time when it's easy to get

00:26:16.694 --> 00:26:21.069
people together so you can tell
them the story.

00:26:21.069 --> 00:26:24.759
The best time would be at
some great festival.

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:28.744
There are festivals held in
each city just for its own

00:26:28.744 --> 00:26:32.880
citizens and my guess is that
when you could do that,

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.138
when you felt that you could
recruit a full colony from your

00:26:36.138 --> 00:26:40.289
fellow citizens in Corinth,
let us say, that's what you did.

00:26:40.289 --> 00:26:43.868
But it would often happen that
there were not enough

00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:48.289
Corinthians who were ready to go
with you on your expedition.

00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:52.386
So, you would try to take your
message to one of the

00:26:52.386 --> 00:26:56.885
Pan-Hellenic festivals which
were getting organized about

00:26:56.885 --> 00:26:58.813
this time.
As you know,

00:26:58.813 --> 00:27:02.430
the Olympic Games are alleged
to have started in 776.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:06.765
So, that would be a place where
Greeks from all over might come

00:27:06.765 --> 00:27:10.541
and you could then try to
recruit settlers for your new

00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:13.257
colony there,
and then we don't know

00:27:13.257 --> 00:27:17.630
precisely when but there were
Pan-Hellenic Games near Corinth,

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.973
the Isthmian Games,
there were Pan-Hellenic Games

00:27:20.973 --> 00:27:24.943
at Delphi and there Pan-Hellenic
Games in the northeastern

00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:27.730
Peloponnesus at a town called
Nemea.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:32.457
So, there would always be some
opportunity for you to go out

00:27:32.457 --> 00:27:36.707
and make your pitch.
So now you have everything in

00:27:36.707 --> 00:27:41.425
place, you've recruited your
settlement, you get on your

00:27:41.425 --> 00:27:45.888
ships and sail,
in this case out to the west

00:27:45.888 --> 00:27:51.309
central Mediterranean,
you find your way to Sicily,

00:27:51.309 --> 00:27:57.664
work your way into the harbor
at Syracuse and things work out,

00:27:57.664 --> 00:28:03.289
and now we have this
apoikia called Syracuse.

00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:08.690
So, the next question I
think is, what is the

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:15.440
relationship between Syracuse
which is the apoikia and

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.705
Corinth,
which is the metropolis,

00:28:19.705 --> 00:28:22.831
the mother city;
that's what metropolis means by

00:28:22.831 --> 00:28:23.140
the way.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.716
First thing to brush from your
mind, along with the word colony

00:28:31.716 --> 00:28:34.150
as we have used it in modern
times,

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:39.643
is the notion that the city of
Syracuse was sent out to be a

00:28:39.643 --> 00:28:45.606
colony, that Corinth controlled,
owned the city of Syracuse

00:28:45.606 --> 00:28:50.338
which it has sent out.
This is not the case--well,

00:28:50.338 --> 00:28:55.358
before the British gave Hong
Kong back, Hong Kong was a crown

00:28:55.358 --> 00:28:58.369
colony, it was British
territory.

00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:03.240
It was ruled by Britain and so
on.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.920
No, this is not what an
apoikia is.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.692
From the first,
Syracuse is an independent

00:29:10.692 --> 00:29:14.372
polis,
autonomous, self-governing,

00:29:14.372 --> 00:29:17.500
whatever regime it wants,
etc.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:24.650
It is not a subject of anybody,
not Corinth or anybody else.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.376
That's not the end of the story.
The question really is,

00:29:27.376 --> 00:29:30.517
so now we know that,
what kind of relations did they

00:29:30.517 --> 00:29:33.591
have?
I would say there are three

00:29:33.591 --> 00:29:38.769
categories that they fall into.
The most typical,

00:29:38.769 --> 00:29:44.725
the usual, everything else is
an exception is that there are

00:29:44.725 --> 00:29:49.671
friendly relations between the
mother city and the

00:29:49.671 --> 00:29:54.677
apoikia,
but keep in mind that they are

00:29:54.677 --> 00:29:58.958
always independent,
and an example is in the

00:29:58.958 --> 00:30:04.418
Peloponnesian War.
Syracuse finds itself besieged

00:30:04.418 --> 00:30:09.886
by the Athenians.
They go to Corinth asking the

00:30:09.886 --> 00:30:16.640
Corinthians to please help us.
The Corinthians are free;

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:21.580
they will be violating no law
or sacred bond if they say,

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.549
sorry we really don't feel like
doing that.

00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:29.286
It would be thought they were
not behaving very well,

00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:33.311
but they would have been as I
say, perfectly within every

00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:35.970
right you can imagine to do
that.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:40.118
But the typical reaction would
be that the Corinthians would

00:30:40.118 --> 00:30:42.579
help, to the extent first of
all,

00:30:42.579 --> 00:30:46.752
that they could and secondly,
to the extent that it was

00:30:46.752 --> 00:30:50.446
consistent with their interests.
Well, in fact,

00:30:50.446 --> 00:30:54.635
the Corinthians send very
little, send a couple of ships

00:30:54.635 --> 00:30:57.141
and a general,
which turn out to be

00:30:57.141 --> 00:31:00.229
tremendously important,
but they couldn't have known

00:31:00.229 --> 00:31:03.023
that in advance.
From where we sit,

00:31:03.023 --> 00:31:06.983
it looks like the Corinthians
were making a gesture of

00:31:06.983 --> 00:31:09.084
friendship,
of solidarity,

00:31:09.084 --> 00:31:13.154
the kind of thing you would
expect a mother city to do,

00:31:13.154 --> 00:31:16.620
not to ignore its
apoikia when it was in

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:21.109
trouble.
So that's all that they did.

00:31:21.109 --> 00:31:23.622
First of all,
it was normal for the

00:31:23.622 --> 00:31:27.539
apoikia to turn to the
mother city for help,

00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:31.306
and it was normal for the
mother city to be inclined to

00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:34.299
help if they could do it.
That's normal.

00:31:34.299 --> 00:31:36.423
I think if you can imagine of
the many, many,

00:31:36.423 --> 00:31:39.077
many colonies there were,
that would have been the usual

00:31:39.077 --> 00:31:41.768
arrangement.
Now, there are exceptions in

00:31:41.768 --> 00:31:44.852
both directions,
and as it happens the cases I

00:31:44.852 --> 00:31:48.210
know best have to do with the
city of Corinth.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:52.155
Corinth sent out a lot of
colonies, which is why we know

00:31:52.155 --> 00:31:54.809
something about their
arrangements.

00:31:54.809 --> 00:31:57.649
The ones I'm talking about all
have to do with the

00:31:57.649 --> 00:32:01.009
Peloponnesian War which is one
of the reasons why we know a

00:32:01.009 --> 00:32:05.142
little bit about it,
because Thucydides tells us the

00:32:05.142 --> 00:32:07.966
details of it.
Well, we know,

00:32:07.966 --> 00:32:13.312
thanks to Thucydides,
that it had become normal for

00:32:13.312 --> 00:32:18.230
Corinth to send out to its
colony Potidaea,

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:23.140
located on the Chalcidic
peninsula, those three fingers

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:28.960
sticking down into the Aegean
Sea from the mainland of Greece,

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.769
this is a town on one of those
fingers.

00:32:32.769 --> 00:32:37.079
Potidaea every year
received magistrates who

00:32:37.079 --> 00:32:42.579
governed their city from Corinth
and this was not imposed,

00:32:42.579 --> 00:32:47.480
this was not by force,
this was by mutual agreement.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.110
So, Corinth really had a very
great deal to say about what was

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.237
going on in Potidaea.
So, when Potidaea got into

00:32:54.237 --> 00:32:57.347
trouble with Athens,
and found itself besieged,

00:32:57.347 --> 00:33:00.930
Corinth sent a real army to go
in there and fight,

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.871
and I think that's because of
this very special relationship

00:33:04.871 --> 00:33:07.773
that they had.
At the other end of the

00:33:07.773 --> 00:33:12.477
spectrum it's again Corinth and
they have a colony up in the

00:33:12.477 --> 00:33:17.987
northwest called Corcyra,
it is the modern Island of

00:33:17.987 --> 00:33:25.297
Corfu, and this colony was
clearly established earlier than

00:33:25.297 --> 00:33:27.441
664,
because that's the first time

00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:28.920
we hear of its taking any
action;

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.480
it's been around for a while,
very early colony.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.978
From the earliest times,
Corcyra does not get along with

00:33:37.978 --> 00:33:42.915
the mother city of Corinth.
The first relationship between

00:33:42.915 --> 00:33:47.448
them is a navel battle,
and thereafter we hear of them

00:33:47.448 --> 00:33:52.495
quarrelling and fighting with
each other just about at least

00:33:52.495 --> 00:33:56.514
once a century right on down
until we get to the

00:33:56.514 --> 00:34:01.988
Peloponnesian War when a quarrel
over who's what out in that area

00:34:01.988 --> 00:34:06.440
between Corinth and Corcyra is,
I would say,

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:11.678
the first instigating element
in bringing on the Peloponnesian

00:34:11.678 --> 00:34:14.329
War.
Okay, so this gives you

00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:18.505
some idea of the range of
possible relationships between

00:34:18.505 --> 00:34:22.470
colony and mother city.
I just want to emphasize one

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:26.807
more time, that the overwhelming
normal situation is the first

00:34:26.807 --> 00:34:29.580
one I described,
friendly relations.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.631
Why not?
These guys that have gone out,

00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:35.730
let us say to Syracuse,
they are your people,

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:39.933
they have relatives back home,
they have friends back home,

00:34:39.933 --> 00:34:44.628
it is natural--oh by the way,
they're accustomed to worship

00:34:44.628 --> 00:34:48.849
the gods in the same way that
the Corinthians do.

00:34:48.849 --> 00:34:51.878
We do know, again,
Thucydides is our source,

00:34:51.878 --> 00:34:55.892
that it was customary for
colonies to send representatives

00:34:55.892 --> 00:35:00.329
back to the mother city for the
religious observations that were

00:35:00.329 --> 00:35:03.861
common to them all,
so that those create good

00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:06.680
feelings.
They feel like their relatives,

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.381
and what could be more natural.
You're out there in Sicily and

00:35:11.381 --> 00:35:14.996
you discover,
of course, that you don't have

00:35:14.996 --> 00:35:20.039
all of the things that you used
to have available to you,

00:35:20.039 --> 00:35:23.099
that used to be made let us say
in Corinth.

00:35:23.099 --> 00:35:25.637
As a matter of fact,
in the early days,

00:35:25.637 --> 00:35:29.375
Corinth was a great center of
painted pottery and was the

00:35:29.375 --> 00:35:32.179
leading producer and exporter of
that.

00:35:32.179 --> 00:35:35.393
So, maybe you wanted a really
fine pot of the kind you used to

00:35:35.393 --> 00:35:38.659
be able to walk to the corner
and pick up at a pottery shop,

00:35:38.659 --> 00:35:41.871
but you can't get now,
so you would want to buy what

00:35:41.871 --> 00:35:44.510
the Corinthians sell.
Guess what?

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:48.380
You've got great grain fields
out there in Syracuse.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.635
Hard to believe today,
but Sicily was one of the major

00:35:51.635 --> 00:35:54.829
granaries of the Mediterranean
world at that time,

00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:58.236
tremendously fruitful,
able to grow the best possible

00:35:58.236 --> 00:36:00.530
crops, very good wheat and so
on.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:04.627
Corinth always needs that kind
of stuff, so we sell you our

00:36:04.627 --> 00:36:08.689
wheat, you sell us your pottery,
you sell good wine that we

00:36:08.689 --> 00:36:12.328
can't grow yet and maybe never
will be able to grow in our

00:36:12.328 --> 00:36:14.670
neighborhood,
so on and so forth.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:19.407
So you can see why it would be
very natural for all sorts of

00:36:19.407 --> 00:36:23.020
ties to unite these colony and
mother city.

00:36:26.599 --> 00:36:30.638
Maybe I ought to just give you
a chance before I turn to the

00:36:30.638 --> 00:36:34.197
next question to ask any
questions that still are not

00:36:34.197 --> 00:36:38.030
clear for you about this
phenomenon of colonization.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:41.104
Everybody okay?
Yes?Student: In the

00:36:41.104 --> 00:36:44.079
original city when they had to
get permission to form a colony,

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:45.792
what group of people was it
that they gave

00:36:45.792 --> 00:36:48.174
permission?Professor
Donald Kagan: The question

00:36:48.174 --> 00:36:50.889
is who gave permission for a
colony to go in the mother city.

00:36:50.889 --> 00:36:54.139
The best guess and that's the
only thing we have.

00:36:54.139 --> 00:36:58.121
These would have been
aristocratic republics at this

00:36:58.121 --> 00:37:01.868
stage of the game,
and so there would have been a

00:37:01.868 --> 00:37:06.239
council of nobles that would
typically have done it.

00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:10.024
As you move later in their
history, you find you can guess

00:37:10.024 --> 00:37:13.876
that there would be councils
that were not purely of nobles

00:37:13.876 --> 00:37:18.059
but might be of wealthy people,
but they would always be a

00:37:18.059 --> 00:37:20.920
minority and come from the upper
class.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:25.190
I think that would be where
they would get their legitimacy.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.708
In the back, yeah?
Student: What extent was

00:37:27.708 --> 00:37:29.719
the primitive form of
[inaudible]Professor

00:37:29.719 --> 00:37:31.855
Donald Kagan: Primitive form
of what [inaudible]

00:37:31.855 --> 00:37:33.615
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:37:33.615 --> 00:37:36.380
Donald Kagan: I'm not sure
that that concept makes--no,

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.902
the answer is no,
because nobody was compelled to

00:37:39.902 --> 00:37:42.449
do anything.
The British practicing

00:37:42.449 --> 00:37:46.526
mercantilism passed navigation
acts, saying what ships could

00:37:46.526 --> 00:37:50.809
carry what and so on--nothing
like that in the Greek world.

00:37:50.809 --> 00:37:54.899
Everybody--all of this is
voluntary on both sides of every

00:37:54.899 --> 00:38:00.690
agreement.
Okay, now where are these

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:04.440
colonies?
Let me give you a little run

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.325
down.
Before we get to that,

00:38:06.325 --> 00:38:09.019
I should say that the Greeks
have already,

00:38:09.019 --> 00:38:12.634
before this period of the
polis and the period of

00:38:12.634 --> 00:38:15.985
colonization which is connected
with the rise of the

00:38:15.985 --> 00:38:19.439
polis,
centuries before that the

00:38:19.439 --> 00:38:24.829
Greeks had already spread out
from their original settlements.

00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:29.969
Right after the collapse of the
Mycenaean world it was a period

00:38:29.969 --> 00:38:33.699
of tremendous confusion and
panic and fear,

00:38:33.699 --> 00:38:39.571
and so on, so that we know that
people fleeing from whoever

00:38:39.571 --> 00:38:45.746
destroyed the Mycenaean world
fled typically eastward into the

00:38:45.746 --> 00:38:49.483
island,
among the islands of the Aegean

00:38:49.483 --> 00:38:54.730
Sea and continuing on to the
coast of Asia Minor beyond them,

00:38:54.730 --> 00:39:00.436
so that by the tenth century
B.C., we see Greek cities lining

00:39:00.436 --> 00:39:04.050
the coast of Asia Minor on the
west,

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:08.021
and even around on the bottom
and to some degree on the north,

00:39:08.021 --> 00:39:10.300
and on the islands in the
Aegean.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:15.380
So, there has been a
Greek--what's the word I want?

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.568
There is an expansion of the
Greek world already by the tenth

00:39:18.568 --> 00:39:21.119
century, and these folks are now
settled down,

00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:25.773
so that some of these cities
are in fact among the most

00:39:25.773 --> 00:39:30.340
important cities sending out
colonies of their own.

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.559
Of these,
the most famous,

00:39:32.559 --> 00:39:35.544
perhaps the most important,
was Miletus,

00:39:35.544 --> 00:39:40.059
an Ionian city located on the
west coast of Asia Minor,

00:39:40.059 --> 00:39:45.233
which sent many a colony into
different parts of the world,

00:39:45.233 --> 00:39:50.495
particularly up towards the
straits and the Bosporus and the

00:39:50.495 --> 00:39:54.549
Sea of Marmara.
I might point out that the way

00:39:54.549 --> 00:39:59.425
the Greeks did their immigration
into Asia Minor actually had a

00:39:59.425 --> 00:40:04.379
pattern so that you can go from
north to south and you will find

00:40:04.379 --> 00:40:07.469
some consistency.
Here's what I mean.

00:40:07.469 --> 00:40:14.195
The northern most settlements
on that coast spoke Greek with

00:40:14.195 --> 00:40:19.587
an Aeolian dialect;
the Aeolian dialect is the one

00:40:19.587 --> 00:40:25.881
that you see on the mainland in
places like Boeotia for instance

00:40:25.881 --> 00:40:31.466
Thebes and so on.
South of the Aeolian section of

00:40:31.466 --> 00:40:37.597
that was the region of Asia
Minor inhabited chiefly by

00:40:37.597 --> 00:40:41.145
Ionians,
the people on the mainland who

00:40:41.145 --> 00:40:44.179
are the main Ionians are the
Athenians.

00:40:44.179 --> 00:40:47.531
Finally, if you go to the most
southern part of the west coast

00:40:47.531 --> 00:40:50.607
of Asia Minor,
you come to the Dorian speaking

00:40:50.607 --> 00:40:52.946
Greeks and the whole
Peloponnesus,

00:40:52.946 --> 00:40:56.405
as you know,
was fundamentally a Dorian

00:40:56.405 --> 00:41:00.391
speaking place.
So that's the way the world

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:05.973
looks when the polis is
invented and when colonization

00:41:05.973 --> 00:41:10.931
begins to become a big thing.
Now, let's take a look at

00:41:10.931 --> 00:41:14.826
the world of the Mediterranean
and see how Greek expansion

00:41:14.826 --> 00:41:18.679
worked.
Let's start with the Aegean Sea.

00:41:18.679 --> 00:41:23.834
Just almost all the islands in
that sea are inhabited by

00:41:23.834 --> 00:41:29.363
Greeks, mostly by the Greeks
that came in that first wave of

00:41:29.363 --> 00:41:34.539
immigrants earlier on,
not colonized during the eighth

00:41:34.539 --> 00:41:38.504
century and afterwards.
But if you go to the north

00:41:38.504 --> 00:41:42.407
shore of the Aegean Sea,
into the region that the Greeks

00:41:42.407 --> 00:41:46.235
called Thrace--sorry,
before I even get to Thrace,

00:41:46.235 --> 00:41:50.335
maybe even a little bit of
Thessaly which is off mostly

00:41:50.335 --> 00:41:54.346
west of the Aegean Sea,
a little bit but not Thrace

00:41:54.346 --> 00:41:58.570
chiefly, which is the northern
shore of the Aegean Sea,

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:02.287
lots of Greek colonies there;
it's fundamentally part of

00:42:02.287 --> 00:42:04.524
Greece.
Yeah, this is not a bad time

00:42:04.524 --> 00:42:08.070
for me to remind you that in one
of Plato's dialogues,

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:16.085
Socrates says the Greeks sit
like frogs around a pond and

00:42:16.085 --> 00:42:22.283
that pond is the Aegean Sea.
It's a helpful little story to

00:42:22.283 --> 00:42:25.963
remember, because we tend to
think of Greece because of its

00:42:25.963 --> 00:42:29.326
modern geography as that
peninsula of which there is a

00:42:29.326 --> 00:42:32.789
sub-peninsula at the bottom,
which is Peloponnesus.

00:42:32.789 --> 00:42:35.150
That was not the Greece of
antiquity.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:39.422
If you had to pick a central
focus of where the Greeks were,

00:42:39.422 --> 00:42:43.840
it would be in the Aegean Sea
so that's useful to remember.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:48.059
Then as you move east along
that coast, you come to the

00:42:48.059 --> 00:42:51.044
Gallipoli Peninsula,
all of which is now Turkey and

00:42:51.044 --> 00:42:53.630
for the rest of what I'm going
to be saying for awhile,

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:56.627
it'll be Turkey as well,
but through the straits,

00:42:56.627 --> 00:42:58.750
the Dardanelles,
Sea of Marmara,

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:04.320
Bosporus, Greek cities all over
on both sides.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.219
If you keep going east you hit
the Black Sea.

00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:12.652
If you move northwards along
the Black Sea and southwards as

00:43:12.652 --> 00:43:16.041
well, Greek cities,
not in the same number,

00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:20.608
they're fewer than they are in
the places I've mentioned so

00:43:20.608 --> 00:43:22.630
far,
but important ones.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:26.635
For instance,
when you get up to Crimea,

00:43:26.635 --> 00:43:31.666
the chief city we call,
Seastapole that comes from

00:43:31.666 --> 00:43:36.151
Greek words,
it means sebastos polis,

00:43:36.151 --> 00:43:40.000
the sacred city,
so named after Augustus by

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.591
Greeks who lived there after the
Emperor Augustus had achieved

00:43:45.591 --> 00:43:49.094
power,
but it was always inhabited by

00:43:49.094 --> 00:43:50.936
Greeks.
Similarly,

00:43:50.936 --> 00:43:55.137
Odessa, the chief city of
Ukraine, apart from Kiev,

00:43:55.137 --> 00:44:00.179
was a Greek city and likewise
on the northern shore of Turkey

00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:03.539
there are Greek cities to be
found.

00:44:03.539 --> 00:44:07.510
One that leaps to mind is--how
do they pronounce it in Turkish?

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:13.704
Is it Trebzond?
But it was Trapezos--what was

00:44:13.704 --> 00:44:18.809
it called in Greek?
Trapezos wasn't it?

00:44:18.809 --> 00:44:24.684
Anyway, the Black Sea is not a
Greek lake, but there are Greek

00:44:24.684 --> 00:44:28.730
cities that are spotted along
the coast.

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.038
Now not on the east coast,
when you get to the Caucuses

00:44:32.038 --> 00:44:37.863
you are in barbarian territory.
So when the mythical mission of

00:44:37.863 --> 00:44:44.980
Jason and his Argonauts go
sailing out to that territory,

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:49.394
he is out there in Tarzan
country, or as far as the Greeks

00:44:49.394 --> 00:44:52.648
were concerned,
it was just the wild out in

00:44:52.648 --> 00:44:57.760
that territory and remember he
marries and brings home a wife,

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:01.804
Media, and she,
of course, is like no Greek

00:45:01.804 --> 00:45:06.000
woman who ever lived;
she is a witch.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.150
She can perform magic and she
can do monstrous things that you

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.599
can't imagine a Greek woman
doing,

00:45:12.599 --> 00:45:16.345
at least the Greeks can't
imagine, so that's not Greek

00:45:16.345 --> 00:45:19.916
territory out there.
Well, let's get back out

00:45:19.916 --> 00:45:23.659
into the Aegean Sea and we just
crossed Asia Minor.

00:45:23.659 --> 00:45:26.390
Now, if you turn the bend at
the southern end of Asia Minor

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:30.316
and begin moving east,
there are some Greek cities

00:45:30.316 --> 00:45:35.080
along in there,
but when you get to what is now

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.414
Lebanon,
Syria, the coastal places

00:45:38.414 --> 00:45:42.626
there, Palestine,
there are no Greek cities there

00:45:42.626 --> 00:45:48.068
and that is because during the
period we're talking about those

00:45:48.068 --> 00:45:52.719
regions were occupied by
civilized powerful people who

00:45:52.719 --> 00:45:56.230
simply would not be pushed
aside,

00:45:56.230 --> 00:46:00.283
and nobody would even dream of
trying to take them on and

00:46:00.283 --> 00:46:04.408
building cities that would
challenge their control of that

00:46:04.408 --> 00:46:07.613
area.
So there are no Greek cities as

00:46:07.613 --> 00:46:10.989
you keep coming down and pass
Palestine.

00:46:10.989 --> 00:46:13.099
You reach Egypt,
and of course,

00:46:13.099 --> 00:46:17.037
Egypt is one of the great
empires of antiquity going back

00:46:17.037 --> 00:46:19.889
into,
perhaps, certainly into the

00:46:19.889 --> 00:46:23.342
fourth millennium,
possibly into the fifth,

00:46:23.342 --> 00:46:26.960
by no means as powerful as it
used to be,

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:31.233
far from it.
It has been conquered by now by

00:46:31.233 --> 00:46:34.660
other peoples.
If you're talking about the

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:40.030
year 750 or something like that
it's--I think it's in the hands,

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:45.257
well, it is in the hands of the
Assyrians and it will ultimately

00:46:45.257 --> 00:46:48.409
fall into the hands of the
Persians.

00:46:48.409 --> 00:46:53.780
So that is not territory that
you can build colonies;

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.880
you've got powerful empires to
deal with.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.714
There is one exception.
In the sixth century,

00:46:58.714 --> 00:47:02.088
I think it's around--imagine
around 550 or something like

00:47:02.088 --> 00:47:04.579
that,
the Greeks settle a single

00:47:04.579 --> 00:47:08.985
colony in the Delta of the Nile
of Egypt at a place called

00:47:08.985 --> 00:47:11.925
Naucratis,
and the root of that word is

00:47:11.925 --> 00:47:14.894
ship.
It is a completely different

00:47:14.894 --> 00:47:20.369
thing from the apoikia
that I've been talking about.

00:47:20.369 --> 00:47:25.077
It is a trading post and it's
there by permission of and under

00:47:25.077 --> 00:47:28.010
the protection of the King of
Egypt,

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:31.427
and that's because he
wants--it's handy for him to

00:47:31.427 --> 00:47:35.472
have a merchant settlement of
Greeks for him to do business

00:47:35.472 --> 00:47:38.636
with.
So, that's a great exception to

00:47:38.636 --> 00:47:43.063
everything I've been saying.
Going west, would you believe,

00:47:43.063 --> 00:47:46.622
when you get into what is now
Libya, there was a very

00:47:46.622 --> 00:47:51.002
important Greek colony of Cyrene
and that whole region was called

00:47:51.002 --> 00:47:55.320
Cyrenaica and it was a Greek.
You can actually go,

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.599
now that I realize that Libya
is now open;

00:47:59.599 --> 00:48:01.670
it's no longer a closed
territory.

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:07.849
You can see Greek and Roman
temples there to prove it.

00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:11.974
When you go west,
however, it stops in the coast

00:48:11.974 --> 00:48:16.584
of North Africa--the reason
being the rest of North Africa

00:48:16.584 --> 00:48:21.952
is dominated by Carthage.
Carthage is a colony of

00:48:21.952 --> 00:48:26.327
Phoenician cities.
Phoenicia was located where

00:48:26.327 --> 00:48:29.386
Lebanon is now,
and it goes back to maybe the

00:48:29.386 --> 00:48:31.471
tenth century,
maybe the ninth,

00:48:31.471 --> 00:48:35.777
and it was powerful.
It tried to control not only

00:48:35.777 --> 00:48:38.895
North Africa,
but the waters of the

00:48:38.895 --> 00:48:42.380
Mediterranean in the west
entirely.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:47.244
The Carthaginians,
in fact, have a powerful

00:48:47.244 --> 00:48:51.250
pied à
terre in the western part

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:55.223
of Sicily and the Greeks will
have to fight the Carthaginians

00:48:55.223 --> 00:48:58.800
over the years for control of
the island of Sicily.

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:03.541
So, that's how far east they
get and in time the

00:49:03.541 --> 00:49:09.695
Carthaginians also cross over
into Spain and they control some

00:49:09.695 --> 00:49:14.840
portion of the Spanish coast
closest to Africa.

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.544
So, there are no Greeks there.
They're shut out for the same

00:49:18.544 --> 00:49:21.100
reasons.
However, once you get beyond

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.962
the Carthaginians advance into
Spain, there are now Greek

00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:28.962
cities on the coast of Spain and
there continue to be Greek

00:49:28.962 --> 00:49:31.183
cities,
not everywhere,

00:49:31.183 --> 00:49:36.945
but in a spotty way into France
of which the most important and

00:49:36.945 --> 00:49:41.870
famous is the one that the
Romans called Masillia,

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:48.570
Marseille, a Greek town.
So is Nice a Greek town.

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:52.507
Nice was Nikea,
victory town and there are

00:49:52.507 --> 00:49:56.233
several others.
So, they know where to go,

00:49:56.233 --> 00:49:58.730
the Riviera,
places like that.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:00.440
Now, what about the Italian
Riviera?

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.189
That's pretty nifty.
Were the Greek colonies near

00:50:03.189 --> 00:50:04.950
Portofino where you could put
in?

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:07.912
No.
And the reason was in the

00:50:07.912 --> 00:50:11.030
northern part of Italy,
there were Etruscans,

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:15.354
another powerful ancient people
who control their own area and

00:50:15.354 --> 00:50:19.820
were not about to have anybody
colonizing their territory.

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:26.066
However, when you keep going
south in Italy,

00:50:26.066 --> 00:50:34.927
past Rome, Roman tradition says
the city was founded in 754 or

00:50:34.927 --> 00:50:37.490
753?
753.

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:41.079
So, everybody agrees about that.
Certainly not before that.

00:50:41.079 --> 00:50:44.003
So, in the period we're talking
about there are no Romans that

00:50:44.003 --> 00:50:48.147
you have to worry about.
So, south of Rome there is a

00:50:48.147 --> 00:50:52.389
tremendous colonizing of
southern Italy.

00:50:52.389 --> 00:50:55.380
Greek cities are all over the
place.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:51:00.251
So Greek was that area that
when the Romans do come to

00:51:00.251 --> 00:51:05.950
dominate most of Italy and sort
of move up against the southern

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:10.913
region they refer to the whole
southern portion of that

00:51:10.913 --> 00:51:14.590
peninsula as Magna
Graecia,

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:18.860
great Greece because they're
all Greeks down there.

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:24.499
Then finally,
down we go to Sicily and there

00:51:24.499 --> 00:51:30.110
you have the east coast.
I would say two-thirds of the

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:34.510
coast of the island of Sicily is
filled with Greek towns.

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:38.510
The third to the west is under
Carthaginian control.

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:42.309
The inland, the Greeks don't
move in there.

00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:45.430
The natives Sicilians inhabit
that territory and the Greeks

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:49.110
are not interested.
You will find very rare of the

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:53.445
case of a Greek city,
which is founded away from the

00:51:53.445 --> 00:51:56.319
sea;
they always wanted to be close

00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:59.130
to the sea for varieties of
reasons.

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:03.420
So, now I hope you have in
your mind a picture of the way

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.139
the Greek world had expanded by
the time this wave of

00:52:07.139 --> 00:52:10.500
colonization was
complete--pretty complete,

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:14.780
sometime in the seventh century
B.C.

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:18.464
Just a word about the leading
colonizers, because I think

00:52:18.464 --> 00:52:21.360
there's something to be learned
from that.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.909
One of the things you kind of
speculate about,

00:52:23.909 --> 00:52:26.460
and wonder about,
why did some cities send out

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:29.671
lots of colonies,
some cities send out only a

00:52:29.671 --> 00:52:33.190
few, and others none at all for
quite a while.

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:36.579
Well, if you see who does then
you may have a clue.

00:52:36.579 --> 00:52:41.800
Well, here is a list of the
early extensive colonizers.

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:45.860
Miletus, I mentioned to you
from Asia Minor;

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:51.052
Corinth on the isthmus;
Megara right next door to

00:52:51.052 --> 00:52:55.889
Corinth, also more or less on
the isthmus.

00:52:55.889 --> 00:53:01.196
Then we turn to the island of
Euboea, that long island that's

00:53:01.196 --> 00:53:05.530
right next to the east coast of
Attica, Euboea.

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:08.853
There were two important cities
in the northern part of that

00:53:08.853 --> 00:53:11.508
island.
One was Calkis and the other

00:53:11.508 --> 00:53:15.881
one was Eretria and we hear
about them relatively early in

00:53:15.881 --> 00:53:19.500
the eighth century,
already being very important,

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:23.494
very strong and fighting each
other in a famous war that they

00:53:23.494 --> 00:53:26.077
fought.
But these cities were very

00:53:26.077 --> 00:53:29.690
active in colonizing in a
variety of directions.

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:34.139
Lots of these towns sent
colonists up north into the

00:53:34.139 --> 00:53:39.724
Dardanelles and so on and beyond
and some of the same cities send

00:53:39.724 --> 00:53:44.143
out colonies to Sicily,
so that for the real colonizing

00:53:44.143 --> 00:53:48.136
states there was no limit to
where they would send people who

00:53:48.136 --> 00:53:52.558
wanted to go in those areas.
It is also interesting to

00:53:52.558 --> 00:53:57.681
notice who does not colonize at
this early period and the answer

00:53:57.681 --> 00:54:03.130
is all the most famous cities of
Greece in the Classical Period.

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:06.932
Athens doesn't send out a
colony until sometime in the

00:54:06.932 --> 00:54:10.468
sixth century.
Sparta starts at an early

00:54:10.468 --> 00:54:16.010
point, sends out a colony to
southern Italy at some time,

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:19.288
probably early,
they sent out a colony to an

00:54:19.288 --> 00:54:21.880
island in the Aegean Sea,
Melos,

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:27.550
and then they stopped and never
sent out another colony.

00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:32.133
Finally, Thebes,
the greatest city in Boeotia,

00:54:32.133 --> 00:54:37.424
also does not colonize.
So what can we speculate is the

00:54:37.424 --> 00:54:41.249
meaning of that?
What we find is that the states

00:54:41.249 --> 00:54:45.215
who are doing most of the
colonizing are located where

00:54:45.215 --> 00:54:49.630
most of the trade was going on
at this point in history,

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:51.909
and also most of the
manufacturing.

00:54:51.909 --> 00:54:55.780
When I say manufacturing,
you understand everything is

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:58.847
done by hand,
but you see things like shops

00:54:58.847 --> 00:55:03.010
that contain a number of slaves
working for a master.

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:05.933
In some cases,
especially the later on you go,

00:55:05.933 --> 00:55:09.376
some shops that have quite a
few slaves that worked to

00:55:09.376 --> 00:55:12.891
produce these things.
It's the handy craft industry

00:55:12.891 --> 00:55:15.110
but it's an industry
nonetheless.

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:21.116
Well, these places are the ones
that have the trade,

00:55:21.116 --> 00:55:24.767
the industry,
and also engage in

00:55:24.767 --> 00:55:28.807
colonization.
Moreover, as we will see,

00:55:28.807 --> 00:55:33.208
there will be internal trouble
in the form of political

00:55:33.208 --> 00:55:36.158
quarreling,
economic conflict,

00:55:36.158 --> 00:55:40.880
and finally warfare,
civil wars occur in some of

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:45.000
these cities leading to the
emergence,

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.435
and in the next topic I'll turn
to, of the establishment of

00:55:49.435 --> 00:55:53.259
tyrannies, as the way of
resolving for a time these

00:55:53.259 --> 00:55:57.159
terribly tumultuous conditions
in those cities.

00:55:57.159 --> 00:56:01.718
All of these things are
true of places like Corinth,

00:56:01.718 --> 00:56:05.199
Megara and possibly Chalcis and
Eretria.

00:56:05.199 --> 00:56:10.723
So, it is easy to see that
where there is that kind of

00:56:10.723 --> 00:56:16.142
conflict and trouble,
there would be people who would

00:56:16.142 --> 00:56:20.519
want to flee that and to go
elsewhere.

00:56:20.519 --> 00:56:24.076
It might well be that the
people who won those wars,

00:56:24.076 --> 00:56:27.005
internal wars,
would have been glad to send

00:56:27.005 --> 00:56:31.050
them away rather than to have
these discontented people and

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:35.025
these folks who were their
enemies hanging around town and

00:56:35.025 --> 00:56:38.922
making trouble.
It is only speculation,

00:56:38.922 --> 00:56:44.804
but it seems to make sense and
we know we don't hear of such

00:56:44.804 --> 00:56:49.690
troubles within Athens and
Thebes, and Sparta.

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:54.276
It also is possible,
again it's just speculation,

00:56:54.276 --> 00:56:59.914
that population pressure might
well be greater in the cities

00:56:59.914 --> 00:57:03.598
that did the colonizing.
They tended,

00:57:03.598 --> 00:57:08.640
in general, not to have as much
farmland as the places that I

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:12.170
have described as not being
colonizers,

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:16.022
who may not have felt the
pressures of land hunger,

00:57:16.022 --> 00:57:20.030
which was so important in
motivating colonization.

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:27.095
So, that may explain why some
of the states did and others did

00:57:27.095 --> 00:57:28.834
not.
Finally,

00:57:28.834 --> 00:57:33.708
what are the consequences to
the Greek experience of this

00:57:33.708 --> 00:57:37.800
phenomenon of this outburst of
colonization?

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:42.548
Several things come to mind.
First of all,

00:57:42.548 --> 00:57:47.850
the Greeks now live in places
where they never lived before

00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:53.335
and their presence has a real
impact of a different degree in

00:57:53.335 --> 00:57:57.400
every place.
I would say that typically

00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:03.289
their impact was greater in the
west and the north than it was

00:58:03.289 --> 00:58:08.047
in the east and the south.
The reason for that was that in

00:58:08.047 --> 00:58:11.268
the east and in south,
the Greeks lived among people

00:58:11.268 --> 00:58:15.119
who were more civilized than
they, who were more advanced.

00:58:15.119 --> 00:58:19.432
They had very little to teach
or to impose upon those people

00:58:19.432 --> 00:58:23.060
rather than vice versa.
I think that I would imagine

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:26.661
the Greeks sopping up all sorts
of useful and interesting

00:58:26.661 --> 00:58:30.583
information from their neighbors
in the east and the south and

00:58:30.583 --> 00:58:34.023
there's no question about it.
If you look at Greece in this

00:58:34.023 --> 00:58:36.269
period, I don't know if I've
used this term before,

00:58:36.269 --> 00:58:40.580
but some scholars refer to this
general period we're talking

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:45.109
about as the Greek renaissance
by analogy to the renaissance in

00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:47.528
Italy.
There's something to it,

00:58:47.528 --> 00:58:51.326
because things happened in this
period that are revolutionary in

00:58:51.326 --> 00:58:54.524
the arts,
in the thinking of people,

00:58:54.524 --> 00:58:59.855
philosophy is going to be
invented in Miletus probably in

00:58:59.855 --> 00:59:05.119
this sixth century B.C.
Well, Miletus was on the main

00:59:05.119 --> 00:59:10.602
routes to all of the places
where advanced knowledge could

00:59:10.602 --> 00:59:13.679
be found, Mesopotamia,
Egypt.

00:59:13.679 --> 00:59:19.249
Anybody who looks at Greek
mythology and Greek poetry,

00:59:19.249 --> 00:59:25.870
and Greek stories sees there is
a powerful influence coming into

00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:31.860
Greek thought from mainly the
Mesopotamian direction.

00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:35.812
Anybody who looks at the
earliest Greek art for quite

00:59:35.812 --> 00:59:40.449
some time, I'm talking about
sculpture and temple building,

00:59:40.449 --> 00:59:46.489
will see the influence of Egypt
enormously powerfully.

00:59:46.489 --> 00:59:52.899
So, the Greeks are sopping up
tremendously useful information

00:59:52.899 --> 00:59:57.657
and talent, and skills,
and all sorts of things that

00:59:57.657 --> 01:00:00.639
help explain what's going to be
coming.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:04.420
It is inconceivable the
Greeks could have developed a

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.931
civilization that they did
without contact with these

01:00:07.931 --> 01:00:12.050
eastern civilizations and
learned a great deal from them.

01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:16.131
Now, people--some people make
an enormous jump from that and

01:00:16.131 --> 01:00:20.489
wrongly suggest that what the
Greeks basically did was--well,

01:00:20.489 --> 01:00:23.916
if you want to take the most
extreme statement of it,

01:00:23.916 --> 01:00:27.079
stole their civilization from
the other folks.

01:00:27.079 --> 01:00:30.002
Well, if you take a look at the
Greek civilization let us say in

01:00:30.002 --> 01:00:32.587
the classical period,
those other cultures wouldn't

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:35.885
have had a clue what the Greeks
were doing, so different was the

01:00:35.885 --> 01:00:39.856
Greek experience from theirs.
But what is undeniably true is

01:00:39.856 --> 01:00:44.449
that the Greeks learned very
important and valuable things,

01:00:44.449 --> 01:00:48.904
and adapted what they learned
through their own way of life

01:00:48.904 --> 01:00:52.130
and produced something really
quite new,

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:57.290
and in many fundamental ways,
not only new but the opposite

01:00:57.290 --> 01:01:01.650
of the places from which these
things had come.

01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:05.264
There was also,
of course, some influence of

01:01:05.264 --> 01:01:08.340
the Greeks on the people they
went to.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.635
Obviously, I started out by
saying this would probably have

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:14.760
been felt most strongly in the
west and in the north,

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.134
where the people,
who lived there,

01:01:17.134 --> 01:01:20.948
before the Greeks came,
were not civilized or were not

01:01:20.948 --> 01:01:24.030
highly civilized.
They did not have great urban

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:27.172
cultures and civilizations,
long traditions of learning and

01:01:27.172 --> 01:01:29.350
so on.
No, they weren't like that,

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:32.795
the Greeks were ahead of them
and it's evident that they

01:01:32.795 --> 01:01:36.489
borrowed stuff from the Greeks
in every element of life,

01:01:36.489 --> 01:01:39.733
although it didn't shape their
lives in a potent,

01:01:39.733 --> 01:01:43.878
fundamental way.
But that's the way influence

01:01:43.878 --> 01:01:48.231
ran in that part of the world.
Of course,

01:01:48.231 --> 01:01:53.075
another tremendously important
consequence of colonization was

01:01:53.075 --> 01:01:56.913
the growth of commerce,
of trade for the reasons I've

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:59.788
already given you,
but beyond that the Greeks of

01:01:59.788 --> 01:02:02.268
course,
now had access to food stuffs

01:02:02.268 --> 01:02:04.974
and other things out in where
they settled,

01:02:04.974 --> 01:02:08.840
which gave them a basis for
trading with the mother city,

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.116
which meant there were markets
for the mother city,

01:02:11.116 --> 01:02:12.710
which they hadn't existed
before.

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:16.869
But also, the Greeks were in
touch with people beyond where

01:02:16.869 --> 01:02:19.522
they settled,
so they could obtain raw

01:02:19.522 --> 01:02:22.750
materials that were not
available before,

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:27.334
and also manufactured things
that they might not have had

01:02:27.334 --> 01:02:30.725
access to before.
All of which they would have

01:02:30.725 --> 01:02:34.528
used some for themselves and
then engaged in trade with the

01:02:34.528 --> 01:02:36.662
old Greek cities.
In other words,

01:02:36.662 --> 01:02:39.625
you don't need a very great
imagination to see how this

01:02:39.625 --> 01:02:41.820
would be a terrific boom to
commerce.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.803
Think about it for a second,
what will this be and how will

01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:50.130
this effect what's happening in
the cities, the polis?

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:53.000
More and more people,
and again I want to remind you,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.050
never anything approaching a
majority,

01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:58.984
but more and more people would
be making their living in a way

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:02.702
that was not agricultural.
They would be in commerce and

01:03:02.702 --> 01:03:06.526
they would be in industry in
this small sense and doing all

01:03:06.526 --> 01:03:10.350
the various things that are not
farming and so you now have

01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:14.438
classes or groups of people who
have interests rather different

01:03:14.438 --> 01:03:19.120
from those of the most primitive
polis you could imagine.

01:03:22.559 --> 01:03:26.666
Some scholars early on in the
century, moved by Marxist

01:03:26.666 --> 01:03:31.610
theories, suggested that you had
a capitalist class growing up,

01:03:31.610 --> 01:03:33.390
there's just no evidence of
that;

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:37.055
it's just wrong.
My guess is that the earliest

01:03:37.055 --> 01:03:42.338
traders of any scope were
probably noblemen who also had

01:03:42.338 --> 01:03:46.534
land and estates back home,
but who had the opportunity,

01:03:46.534 --> 01:03:48.366
the know-how,
the connections to make it

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:50.480
possible to make a lot of living
in trade.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.795
Even so, while you don't have a
class of separate people who are

01:03:54.795 --> 01:03:58.699
just in the business of making
things and making money,

01:03:58.699 --> 01:04:02.319
you do have people who are
engaged in those activities and

01:04:02.319 --> 01:04:06.383
who have some interests that are
different from those of the rest

01:04:06.383 --> 01:04:09.050
of their people who are only
hoplites.

01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:11.532
It is, I think,
part of a conglomerate of

01:04:11.532 --> 01:04:14.974
activities you want to keep in
your mind that is going on here

01:04:14.974 --> 01:04:17.739
and this is what I'm really
trying to get at,

01:04:17.739 --> 01:04:20.099
socially and economically,
and politically.

01:04:20.099 --> 01:04:22.796
You have to imagine,
on the one hand,

01:04:22.796 --> 01:04:26.465
the hoplite revolution,
which I do not shrink from

01:04:26.465 --> 01:04:29.311
saying, but it's a very
debatable term,

01:04:29.311 --> 01:04:32.527
is going on.
More and more farmers are

01:04:32.527 --> 01:04:35.290
becoming independent,
self-sustaining,

01:04:35.290 --> 01:04:39.099
hoplite farmers of the kind
that I've described.

01:04:39.099 --> 01:04:42.918
You can't expect them to
continue to live in the same way

01:04:42.918 --> 01:04:46.555
as they did before,
deferential to their betters,

01:04:46.555 --> 01:04:49.978
that is to say,
tugging their forelocks before

01:04:49.978 --> 01:04:54.237
the aristocrats and just leaving
all the decisions to the

01:04:54.237 --> 01:04:57.355
aristocrats.
They're not going to feel the

01:04:57.355 --> 01:05:00.251
same way about it,
there's going to be pressure

01:05:00.251 --> 01:05:03.525
from them for a better
participation in the decisions

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:07.854
that are made in the state.
And also there will be some

01:05:07.854 --> 01:05:12.825
rich people, very rich people,
rich in a different way from

01:05:12.825 --> 01:05:18.110
the way people used to be rich;
rich meant the best land.

01:05:18.110 --> 01:05:23.851
Now, there will be people who
will have wealth in the form of

01:05:23.851 --> 01:05:28.539
precious things and I would use
the word money.

01:05:28.539 --> 01:05:31.470
I'm not going to use the word
coinage because that's very

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:34.347
debated, and anyway there
certainly weren't any coins in

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:37.905
Greece as early as say 750.
But that doesn't mean there was

01:05:37.905 --> 01:05:41.344
no money.
You could have weighed out

01:05:41.344 --> 01:05:44.909
precious metal,
which would be money.

01:05:44.909 --> 01:05:49.670
Shekels, as in the Bible,
are originally not coins;

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:53.463
they are quantities,
weights of something and come

01:05:53.463 --> 01:05:56.250
to mean weights of silver or
gold.

01:05:56.250 --> 01:06:01.630
So now you have a change in
fundamental economic things.

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:05.875
Well, all of this is tied up
with this colonial story I've

01:06:05.875 --> 01:06:09.194
been telling you.
Finally, I think,

01:06:09.194 --> 01:06:15.803
it works in both directions at
the same time in terms of the

01:06:15.803 --> 01:06:22.860
impact all of these changes have
on the political situation.

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:27.817
On the one hand the changes,
that is (A) the rise of the

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:32.092
hoplite class;
(B) the development of lots of

01:06:32.092 --> 01:06:37.757
commerce and industry and wealth
in a new kind and people who

01:06:37.757 --> 01:06:42.099
don't fit into the old
traditional society;

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:46.164
new way has to be found to fit
them in because,

01:06:46.164 --> 01:06:51.059
as I say, they don't fit.
That creates trouble.

01:06:51.059 --> 01:06:54.944
As we shall see very shortly,
that trouble often takes the

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:58.079
form of first of factional
struggles within the

01:06:58.079 --> 01:07:01.276
aristocracy,
which then after awhile come to

01:07:01.276 --> 01:07:05.013
involve people outside the
aristocracy, which ultimately

01:07:05.013 --> 01:07:08.750
come to civil war in which
certainly the people who have

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:11.739
become the most important
fighting men,

01:07:11.739 --> 01:07:14.760
the hoplites,
become engaged on one side or

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.710
the other or perhaps sometimes
on both.

01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:20.406
So that's the,
what you might say,

01:07:20.406 --> 01:07:23.030
is the negative side of the
story.

01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:26.557
But colonization,
especially, some scholars have

01:07:26.557 --> 01:07:29.260
pointed out, I think
persuasively,

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:35.367
also for some considerable time
provided an answer to that

01:07:35.367 --> 01:07:39.760
problem in the form of an escape
valve,

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:43.358
where you had these people who
were losers and angry and

01:07:43.358 --> 01:07:47.414
troubled, or people who had in
any case were not happy with the

01:07:47.414 --> 01:07:50.489
way things were going in their
mother city.

01:07:50.489 --> 01:07:52.510
Well, they didn't have to stay
and fight it out.

01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:57.398
They could go away and they
did, in very considerable

01:07:57.398 --> 01:08:02.380
numbers, and so one is easily
reminded of the American

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:05.562
experience,
as it has often been

01:08:05.562 --> 01:08:09.905
interpreted, in which the
frontier is seen to be a

01:08:09.905 --> 01:08:14.780
tremendously valuable safety
valve to the Americans,

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.970
first as colonists,
and then as independent people.

01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:22.219
Americans didn't have the
kind of terrible class warfare

01:08:22.219 --> 01:08:26.540
and the terrible warfare within
cities that the Europeans had

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:30.069
experienced throughout most of
their history,

01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:34.824
because really unhappy and
angry people could always go

01:08:34.824 --> 01:08:38.932
west, get new places.
I mean, fundamentally,

01:08:38.932 --> 01:08:44.897
Kansas is a colony in a certain
Greek sense, all of these places

01:08:44.897 --> 01:08:48.109
are.
So, that's part of the story of

01:08:48.109 --> 01:08:52.880
why America had the very lucky
early history that it had.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:57.516
So, I think we have to
understand that colonization

01:08:57.516 --> 01:09:03.079
provided something analogous to
that for the Greek people.

01:09:03.079 --> 01:09:06.933
So now, here we are somewhere
in the seventh century,

01:09:06.933 --> 01:09:11.750
most of these places I've been
talking about have been settled,

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:16.179
the currents that I have been
describing are flowing and the

01:09:16.179 --> 01:09:20.684
kinds of problems they have give
rise to what will be felt in

01:09:20.684 --> 01:09:25.113
most of the towns and that is
the proper introduction to the

01:09:25.113 --> 01:09:28.239
next topic,
which I'll discuss next year.

01:09:28.239 --> 01:09:32.000
No not--it seems like a year,
but it's next Tuesday actually.

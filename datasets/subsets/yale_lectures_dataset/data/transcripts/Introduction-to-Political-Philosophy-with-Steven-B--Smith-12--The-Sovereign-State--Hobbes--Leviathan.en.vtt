00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.636
Professor Steven Smith:
O.K., today,

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:06.650
what a joy.
What a joy!

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.778
We start Hobbes.
And he is one of the great

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:11.680
treats.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.019
Thomas Hobbes was the author of
the first and,

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.330
I believe, undoubtedly the
greatest, work of political

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.640
theory written in the English
language.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.400
He was a master of English
style and prose,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.746
and his work ranks among the
very greatest in this or any

00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:44.900
other language.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.829
Leviathan is to prose
what Milton's Paradise

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.680
Lost is to epic poetry.
Think about that.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:11.439
Hobbes was in many ways a
perfect foil for Machiavelli.

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:21.126
He played the part of Doctor
Watson to Machiavelli's Sherlock

00:01:21.126 --> 00:01:25.174
Holmes.
Hobbes, in other words,

00:01:25.174 --> 00:01:31.830
carried out what Machiavelli
had helped him make possible.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.868
Machiavelli,
you remember,

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:37.291
claimed to have discovered a
new continent,

00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:42.178
new modes and orders.
It was Hobbes who helped to

00:01:42.178 --> 00:01:45.870
make this new continent
habitable.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.571
Machiavelli,
you might say,

00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:53.500
cleared the brush.
He was the Lewis and Clarke or

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.300
the Columbus.
Hobbes built the houses and

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.924
institutions.
Hobbes provided us with the

00:02:01.924 --> 00:02:05.912
definitive language in which
even today we continue to speak

00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:07.670
about the modern state.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.701
However, and this is what I
want to emphasize throughout our

00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:22.104
reading of Hobbes,
he has always been something of

00:02:22.104 --> 00:02:26.517
a paradox to his readers.
On the one hand,

00:02:26.517 --> 00:02:33.408
you will find Hobbes the most
articulate defender of political

00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:37.092
absolutism.
Hobbes in the Hobbesian

00:02:37.092 --> 00:02:41.754
doctrine of sovereignty,
or the Hobbesian sovereign,

00:02:41.754 --> 00:02:46.508
to have a complete monopoly of
power within his given

00:02:46.508 --> 00:02:49.174
territory.
In fact, the famous

00:02:49.174 --> 00:02:52.718
frontispiece of the book,
which is reproduced in your

00:02:52.718 --> 00:02:56.330
edition, although it is not
altogether very clear.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.449
It is not a very good
reproduction,

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:04.404
the famous frontispiece to the
original 1651 edition of

00:03:04.404 --> 00:03:08.349
Leviathan depicts the
Leviathan,

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.328
depicts the state,
the sovereign,

00:03:11.328 --> 00:03:16.819
holding a sword in one hand and
the scepter in the other,

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.125
and the various institutions of
the civilian and churchly

00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:24.199
ecclesiastical authority on each
side.

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:29.325
The sovereign holds total power
over all the institutions of

00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:34.278
civilian and ecclesiastical
life, holding sway over a kind

00:03:34.278 --> 00:03:37.603
of peaceable kingdom.
Add to this,

00:03:37.603 --> 00:03:42.022
to the doctrine of indivisible
sovereign power,

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:47.211
Hobbes' insistence that the
sovereign exercise complete

00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:53.731
control over the churches,
over the university curricula,

00:03:53.731 --> 00:04:00.460
and over what books and
opinions can be read and taught.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.442
He seems to be the perfect
model of absolutism and of

00:04:05.442 --> 00:04:10.109
absolute government.
You have to consider also the

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.781
following.
Hobbes insists on the

00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:17.642
fundamental equality of human
beings, who he says are endowed

00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:21.449
with certain natural and
inalienable rights.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:27.317
He maintains the state is a
product of a covenant or a

00:04:27.317 --> 00:04:32.540
compact, a contract of a sort,
between individuals,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.495
and that the sovereign owes his
authority to the will or the

00:04:37.495 --> 00:04:42.458
consent of those he governs,
and finally that the sovereign

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:47.254
is authorized only to protect
the interests of the governed by

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:50.399
maintaining civil peace and
security.

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:54.408
From this point of view,
it would seem that Hobbes helps

00:04:54.408 --> 00:04:58.563
to establish the language of
what we might think of as the

00:04:58.563 --> 00:05:01.259
liberal opposition to
absolutism.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:06.730
And this paradox was noted even
in Hobbes' own time.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.277
Was he a defender of royalism
and the power of the king,

00:05:12.277 --> 00:05:17.319
or was he a defender or an
opponent of royalism?

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.944
I mean, in many ways,
to be sure, Hobbes was a

00:05:21.944 --> 00:05:26.980
product of his time,
and what else could he be?

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.204
But Hobbes lived at a time when
the modern system of European

00:05:32.204 --> 00:05:37.341
states, even as we understand
them today, was just beginning

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:40.522
to emerge.
Three years before the

00:05:40.522 --> 00:05:46.143
publication of Leviathan,
1651, the signing of the Treaty

00:05:46.143 --> 00:05:50.002
of Westphalia,
famous peace treaty,

00:05:50.002 --> 00:05:56.794
brought an end to more than a
century of religious war that

00:05:56.794 --> 00:06:02.649
had been ignited by the
Protestant Reformation.

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:07.738
The Treaty of Westphalia
officially put an end to the 30

00:06:07.738 --> 00:06:13.474
Years War, but more than that it
ratified two decisive features

00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:18.470
that would be given powerful
expression by Hobbes.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:24.053
First, the Treaty declared that
the individual sovereign state

00:06:24.053 --> 00:06:29.269
would henceforth become the
highest level of authority;

00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:32.992
you might say,
putting an end once and for all

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:37.459
to the universalist claims of
the Holy Roman Empire.

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:41.699
Each state was to be sovereign
and to have its own authority.

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:44.637
And secondly,
that the head of each state

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:48.455
would have the right to
determine the religion of the

00:06:48.455 --> 00:06:51.807
state,
again thus putting an end to

00:06:51.807 --> 00:06:55.920
the claims of a single
universalist church.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.273
This is what the Treaty of
Westphalia put into practice

00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:05.127
and, among other things,
what Hobbes attempted to

00:07:05.127 --> 00:07:11.907
express in theory in his book:
the autonomy and authority of

00:07:11.907 --> 00:07:17.768
the sovereign and the
sovereign's power to establish

00:07:17.768 --> 00:07:23.427
what religious doctrine or what,
even more broadly,

00:07:23.427 --> 00:07:28.120
what opinions are to be taught
and held within a community,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.950
within a state.
Who was Hobbes?

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:35.308
Let me say a word about him.
Hobbes was born in 1588,

00:07:35.308 --> 00:07:41.429
the year that the English naval
forces drove back the invasion

00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:47.415
of the famous Spanish Armada.
He grew up in the waning years,

00:07:47.415 --> 00:07:50.817
the last years,
of the Elizabethan era,

00:07:50.817 --> 00:07:55.472
and he was a boy when
Shakespeare's most famous plays

00:07:55.472 --> 00:08:00.254
were first performed.
Hobbes, like many of you,

00:08:00.254 --> 00:08:04.769
was a gifted student,
and he went to college.

00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:09.362
His father, who was a local
pastor from the southwest of

00:08:09.362 --> 00:08:14.205
England, sent him to Oxford,
although he went at the age of

00:08:14.205 --> 00:08:16.765
14.
And after he graduated,

00:08:16.765 --> 00:08:20.887
he entered the service of an
aristocratic family,

00:08:20.887 --> 00:08:25.354
the Cavandish family,
where he became a private tutor

00:08:25.354 --> 00:08:26.900
to their son.

00:08:29.939 --> 00:08:34.853
His first book was a
translation of Thucydides'

00:08:34.853 --> 00:08:41.368
History of the Peloponnesian
War, which he completed in

00:08:41.368 --> 00:08:44.443
1629;
Thucydides, the great historian

00:08:44.443 --> 00:08:48.260
of the Peloponnesian War,
who we mentioned before when we

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.217
talked about Plato.
Hobbes was a gifted classical

00:08:53.217 --> 00:08:56.972
scholar.
He spent a considerable amount

00:08:56.972 --> 00:09:01.800
of time on the European
continent with his young tutee,

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.320
Mr.
Cavandish.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:09.920
And while he spent time in
Europe, he met Galileo and Rene

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.192
Descartes.
It was during the 1640s,

00:09:14.192 --> 00:09:21.279
the period that initiated the
great civil wars in England,

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:26.691
and the execution of the king,
Charles I, that Hobbes left

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:30.960
England to live in France,
while the fighting went on.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.000
He left England with many of
the royal families,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.471
the aristocratic families,
who were threatened by the

00:09:39.471 --> 00:09:44.630
republican armies organized by
Cromwell and that had executed

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.440
the King.
In fact, the three justices,

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.220
the three judges,
who were in charge of the

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.190
judicial trial of Charles I,
King Charles,

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.276
the one who lost his head,
those three judges later found

00:10:01.276 --> 00:10:03.950
a home where?
In New Haven.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.149
They came to New Haven,
the three judges,

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:11.720
Judge Whaley,
Goff, and Dixwell.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.480
Does that sound familiar?
Yes.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.972
New Haven was in part started
by, founded by,

00:10:17.972 --> 00:10:20.933
members of the,
you might say,

00:10:20.933 --> 00:10:27.570
the republican opposition to
royalty and to the English king.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.738
And any way,
Hobbes, however,

00:10:29.738 --> 00:10:33.146
was deeply distressed by the
outbreak of war,

00:10:33.146 --> 00:10:37.793
and he spent a great deal of
time reflecting on the causes of

00:10:37.793 --> 00:10:41.580
war and political disorder.
His first treatise,

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.623
a book called De Cive,
or De Cive,

00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:47.019
depending on how you pronounce
it,

00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:50.354
On the Citizen,
was published in 1642,

00:10:50.354 --> 00:10:54.749
and it was a kind of draft
version of Leviathan that

00:10:54.749 --> 00:10:57.780
was published almost a decade
later,

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.009
again in 1651.
Hobbes returned to England the

00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:05.894
same year of the book's
publication, and spent most of

00:11:05.894 --> 00:11:11.528
the rest of his long life,
Leviathan was written

00:11:11.528 --> 00:11:17.470
well into his 60s.
He was 63 when it was published.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:22.315
He spent the rest of his long
life working on scientific and

00:11:22.315 --> 00:11:25.783
political problems.
He wrote a history of the

00:11:25.783 --> 00:11:28.711
English Civil Wars,
called Behemoth,

00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:33.033
which remains a classic of the
analysis of the causes of social

00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:36.414
conflict.
And as if this were not enough,

00:11:36.414 --> 00:11:40.913
near the very end of his life,
he returned to his classical

00:11:40.913 --> 00:11:44.481
studies translating all of
Homer's Iliad and

00:11:44.481 --> 00:11:52.654
Odyssey.
He died in 1679 at the age of

00:11:52.654 --> 00:11:56.579
91.
From the various portraits and

00:11:56.579 --> 00:12:01.545
descriptions of Hobbes,
we can tell he was a man of

00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:05.606
considerable charm,
and I wish that in the book we

00:12:05.606 --> 00:12:08.797
had had his picture,
a reproduction of his portrait,

00:12:08.797 --> 00:12:12.054
on it.
But I just want to read one

00:12:12.054 --> 00:12:17.044
brief passage from his
biographer, a man named John

00:12:17.044 --> 00:12:21.395
Aubrey, who knew him.
It was written during Hobbes'

00:12:21.395 --> 00:12:23.706
lifetime.
Aubrey wrote about Hobbes:

00:12:23.706 --> 00:12:27.481
"He had a good eye and that of
hazel color, which was full of

00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:29.809
life and spirit,
even to the last.

00:12:29.809 --> 00:12:33.479
When he was earnest in
discourse, these shone,

00:12:33.479 --> 00:12:38.290
as it were, a bright- as if a
bright live coal within it.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.369
He had two kinds of looks.
When he laughed,

00:12:41.369 --> 00:12:45.179
was witty, in a merry humor,
one could scarce sees his eyes,

00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:48.789
and by and by,
when he was serious and

00:12:48.789 --> 00:12:52.399
positive, he opened his eyes
round.

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:54.929
He was six foot high and
something better."

00:12:54.929 --> 00:12:58.169
So that was very tall in the
seventeenth century.

00:12:58.169 --> 00:13:01.009
"He was six foot high and very
better.

00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:04.649
He had read much,
if one considers his long life,

00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:08.820
but his contemplation was much
more than his reading.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:14.597
He was want to say that if he
had read as much as other men,

00:13:14.597 --> 00:13:19.200
he should have known no more
than other men."

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.259
So his point was he had read a
lot, but what was most important

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:28.071
was his thinking.
If he had read as much,

00:13:28.071 --> 00:13:32.817
he would know as little.
Gives you a little sense of

00:13:32.817 --> 00:13:36.375
Hobbes' spirit,
his humor, the wry wit that

00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:40.950
becomes apparent on almost every
page of this book,

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.330
but you have to be a careful
reader.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.227
Hobbes was deeply
controversial,

00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:51.340
as you might suspect,
during his lifetime.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:57.035
Leviathan was excoriated
by almost every reader of the

00:13:57.035 --> 00:13:59.336

To the churchmen,

00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:03.398
he was a godless atheist.
To the republicans,

00:14:03.398 --> 00:14:07.090
he was tainted with monarchy,
or monarchism.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:11.166
And to the monarchists,
he was a dangerous skeptic and

00:14:11.166 --> 00:14:13.583
free thinker.
Hobbes, again,

00:14:13.583 --> 00:14:18.454
along with Machiavelli,
was one of the great architects

00:14:18.454 --> 00:14:21.901
of the modern state.
And to some degree,

00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:24.860
he even seems to speak,
he seems even more

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.179
characteristically modern than
Machiavelli.

00:14:28.179 --> 00:14:30.429
I mean, consider just some of
the following.

00:14:30.429 --> 00:14:34.603
Machiavelli speaks of the
prince, while Hobbes speaks of

00:14:34.603 --> 00:14:38.018
the sovereign,
that is a kind of impersonal or

00:14:38.018 --> 00:14:43.480
in Hobbes' language,
artificial power created out of

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:49.179
a contract.
Hobbes' method seems scientific.

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:54.440
It seems formal and analytical
in contrast to Machiavelli's

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.519
combination of historical
commentary and reflection drawn

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:03.370
from personal experience.
While Hobbes,

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:08.441
excuse me, while Machiavelli
often spoke of the sublime

00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:12.480
cruelty of men like Scipio and
Hannibal,

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.688
Hobbes speaks the more
pedestrian language,

00:15:15.688 --> 00:15:20.883
the language of power-politics,
where the goal is not glory and

00:15:20.883 --> 00:15:26.950
honor, but self-preservation.
And Machiavelli's emphasis upon

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:33.799
arms is considerably attenuated
by Hobbes' emphasis on laws.

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:40.049
Hobbes, in other words,
tried to render acceptable,

00:15:40.049 --> 00:15:46.181
tried to render palatable,
what Machiavelli had done by

00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:51.444
providing a more precise and
more legal and institutional

00:15:51.444 --> 00:15:56.486
framework for the modern state.
So let's think a little bit

00:15:56.486 --> 00:16:00.590
about what it was that Hobbes
was attempting to accomplish.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:10.656
Hobbes, like Machiavelli,
was an innovator,

00:16:10.656 --> 00:16:16.990
and he was self-consciously
aware of his innovations.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.965
And like Machiavelli,
who said in the fifteenth

00:16:19.965 --> 00:16:23.653
chapter of The Prince
that he would be the first to

00:16:23.653 --> 00:16:26.370
examine the effectual truth of
things,

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:30.505
as opposed to the imaginings of
them, Hobbes wrote that civil

00:16:30.505 --> 00:16:34.090
science, that is what he called
political science,

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:38.646
civil science,
was no older than my book De

00:16:38.646 --> 00:16:42.244
Cive.
Modern political science,

00:16:42.244 --> 00:16:46.120
he said, began with this book
of 1642.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.460
What did he think of as his
novelty?

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:54.093
What was new?
What was revolutionary about,

00:16:54.093 --> 00:16:57.975
or innovative,
about Hobbes' political

00:16:57.975 --> 00:17:01.643
science?
Hobbes clearly saw himself,

00:17:01.643 --> 00:17:06.113
in many respects,
as founding a political science

00:17:06.113 --> 00:17:11.420
modeled along that of the early
founders of the scientific

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.816
revolution.
Galileo, I have already

00:17:14.816 --> 00:17:18.547
indicated that Hobbes had met,
William Harvey,

00:17:18.547 --> 00:17:22.029
Rene Descartes;
a handful of others who were

00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:25.440
part of what we think of as the
modern scientific

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.294
revolutionaries.
And like these other

00:17:28.294 --> 00:17:31.979
revolutionaries who had
overthrown, you might say,

00:17:31.979 --> 00:17:35.589
the Aristotelian paradigm in
natural science,

00:17:35.589 --> 00:17:41.813
Hobbes set out to undermine the
authority of Aristotle in civil

00:17:41.813 --> 00:17:46.029
science, in political and moral
science.

00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:51.241
Hobbes set himself up as the
great anti-Aristotle,

00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:55.069
the great opposition to
Aristotle.

00:17:55.069 --> 00:17:59.343
Consider just the following
passage from Leviathan

00:17:59.343 --> 00:18:02.930
with one of my favorite titles
from the book,

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:07.567
a chapter called "Of Darkness
from Vain Philosophy and

00:18:07.567 --> 00:18:10.706
Fabulous Traditions."
In that chapter,

00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:14.436
chapter 46, Hobbes writes:
"There is nothing so absurd

00:18:14.436 --> 00:18:18.799
that the old philosophers have
not some of them maintained.

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:22.558
And I believe that scarce
anything could be more absurdly

00:18:22.558 --> 00:18:26.250
said in natural philosophy than
that which is now called

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.199
Aristotle's Metaphysics,
nor more repugnant to

00:18:30.199 --> 00:18:34.920
government than much that he had
said in his Politics,

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.288
nor more ignorantly than a
great part of his

00:18:38.288 --> 00:18:43.283
Ethics."
So there, you see Hobbes laying

00:18:43.283 --> 00:18:48.467
down a challenge.
What was it that he claimed to

00:18:48.467 --> 00:18:52.544
find so absurd,
repugnant and ignorant in

00:18:52.544 --> 00:18:53.870
Aristotle?

00:18:57.609 --> 00:19:02.468
Why did he--what did he--what
was he trying to un-throne,

00:19:02.468 --> 00:19:04.550
dethrone in Aristotle?

00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:12.450
Hobbes is typically concerned
with the foundations of this new

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:17.339
science, getting the building
blocks right from the beginning.

00:19:17.339 --> 00:19:20.406
The opening chapters of
Leviathan,

00:19:20.406 --> 00:19:24.776
which I have only assigned a
few, but the opening chapters

00:19:24.776 --> 00:19:29.146
present a kind of political
physics where human beings are

00:19:29.146 --> 00:19:33.516
reduced to body and the body is
further reduced to so much

00:19:33.516 --> 00:19:38.129
matter and motion.
Human beings can be reduced to

00:19:38.129 --> 00:19:41.710
their movable parts much like a
machine.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.303
"What is life?" he asks,
rhetorically in the

00:19:48.303 --> 00:19:51.434
introduction.
"What is life but a motion of

00:19:51.434 --> 00:19:54.812
the limbs?
What is the heart but a spring,

00:19:54.812 --> 00:19:59.021
or reason but a means of
calculating pleasures and

00:19:59.021 --> 00:20:01.748
pains."
He sets out to give a

00:20:01.748 --> 00:20:05.664
deliberately and thoroughly
materialistic and

00:20:05.664 --> 00:20:09.579
non-teleological physics of
human nature.

00:20:09.579 --> 00:20:13.534
In fact, a French disciple of
Hobbes in the next century,

00:20:13.534 --> 00:20:17.330
a man named La Mettrie,
wrote a treatise very much

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:22.329
following in the lines of Hobbes
called L'Homme Machine,

00:20:22.329 --> 00:20:24.920
or literally,
Man a Machine.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:30.773
This is the way Hobbes' new
science of politics appears to

00:20:30.773 --> 00:20:37.346
begin, and that new beginning is
intended to offer in many ways a

00:20:37.346 --> 00:20:42.790
comprehensive alternative to
Aristotle's physics,

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:47.616
or Aristotle's politics.
Aristotle, remember,

00:20:47.616 --> 00:20:51.763
argues that all action is
goal-directed,

00:20:51.763 --> 00:20:56.335
is goal-oriented.
All actions aim at preservation

00:20:56.335 --> 00:21:00.910
or change, at making something
better or preventing it from

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.928
becoming worse.
Hobbes believed,

00:21:03.928 --> 00:21:08.824
on the other hand,
that the overriding human fact,

00:21:08.824 --> 00:21:13.519
the overriding motivation of
human behavior,

00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:18.299
is largely negative,
not the desire to do good,

00:21:18.299 --> 00:21:22.039
but the desire to avoid some
evil.

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:25.912
Aristotle, for Hobbes,
had simply seen the world

00:21:25.912 --> 00:21:29.289
through the wrong end of the
telescope.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:32.875
For Aristotle,
human beings have a goal or a

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:36.127
telos,
which is to live a life in

00:21:36.127 --> 00:21:41.130
community with others for the
sake of human flourishing.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:45.009
But for Hobbes,
we enter into society not in

00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:49.519
order to fulfill or perfect our
rational nature,

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:52.774
but rather to avoid the
greatest evil,

00:21:52.774 --> 00:21:57.700
namely death or fear of death,
at the hands of others.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.935
Politics, for him,
is less a matter of prudential

00:22:01.935 --> 00:22:07.305
decisions of better and worse,
than it is, you might say,

00:22:07.305 --> 00:22:12.299
an existential decision of
choosing life or death.

00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:16.432
For Hobbes, in many ways,
as for Machiavelli,

00:22:16.432 --> 00:22:20.940
it is the extreme situation of
life and death,

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.945
of chaos and war,
that come to serve as the norm

00:22:24.945 --> 00:22:28.780
for politics and political
decision-making,

00:22:31.859 --> 00:22:37.180
fundamental alternative or
challenge to Aristotle.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.925
And furthermore,
Hobbes not only criticized,

00:22:40.925 --> 00:22:43.799
you might say,
the foundations,

00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:46.829
the motivational and
psychological foundations,

00:22:46.829 --> 00:22:50.319
of Aristotle's theory of
politics and human nature,

00:22:50.319 --> 00:22:57.722
he blamed the influence of
Aristotle for much of the civil

00:22:57.722 --> 00:23:03.652
conflict of his age.
Aristotle, who was increasingly

00:23:03.652 --> 00:23:08.805
being embraced by civic
republicans in England of his

00:23:08.805 --> 00:23:12.991
time had been brought up,
according to Hobbes,

00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:16.944
on Aristotle's teaching that
man is by nature a political

00:23:16.944 --> 00:23:18.970
animal.
This was, again,

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:23.672
the thesis of the classical
republicans according to which

00:23:23.672 --> 00:23:28.698
we are only fully human,
or we only become fully human,

00:23:28.698 --> 00:23:32.149
when we are engaged in
political life,

00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:36.720
in ruling ourselves by laws of
our own making.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.564
This was a doctrine that Hobbes
attributes to many of the

00:23:41.564 --> 00:23:47.099
teaching, much of the teaching
at the universities of his age.

00:23:47.099 --> 00:23:50.574
And it is precisely this desire
to be self-governing,

00:23:50.574 --> 00:23:54.544
you might say to rule directly,
to have a direct part in

00:23:54.544 --> 00:23:57.779
political rule,
that Hobbes saw as one of the

00:23:57.779 --> 00:24:02.852
great root causes of civil war.
And his answer to Aristotle and

00:24:02.852 --> 00:24:08.079
to the classical republicans of
his age, was his famous doctrine

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:11.980
of what we might call "indirect
government,"

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:16.742
or what perhaps would be more
familiar to us by the term

00:24:16.742 --> 00:24:21.481
"representative government."
The sovereign is not,

00:24:21.481 --> 00:24:27.397
for Hobbes, the people or some
faction of the people ruling

00:24:27.397 --> 00:24:31.579
directly in their collective
capacity.

00:24:31.579 --> 00:24:35.538
The sovereign is,
for Hobbes, the artificially

00:24:35.538 --> 00:24:40.288
reconstructed will of the people
in the person of their

00:24:40.288 --> 00:24:44.183
representative.
The sovereign representative

00:24:44.183 --> 00:24:48.234
acts, you might say,
like a filter for the wills and

00:24:48.234 --> 00:24:53.021
passions of the people.
The sovereign is not the direct

00:24:53.021 --> 00:24:58.290
expression of my will or your
will, but rather an abstraction

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.890
from my natural desire to rule
myself.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.246
In other words,
instead of seeking to

00:25:05.246 --> 00:25:09.069
participate directly in
political rule,

00:25:09.069 --> 00:25:14.868
Hobbes wants us to abstain from
politics by agreeing to be ruled

00:25:14.868 --> 00:25:18.421
by this artificial man,
as he calls it,

00:25:18.421 --> 00:25:23.177
this artificial person or
representative that he gives the

00:25:23.177 --> 00:25:26.336
name "the sovereign."
"For by art",

00:25:26.336 --> 00:25:31.231
he says in the introduction,
"For by art is created that

00:25:31.231 --> 00:25:35.859
great Leviathan called a
commonwealth or a state,

00:25:35.859 --> 00:25:40.390
which is but an artificial man,
though of greater stature and

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:44.920
strength than the natural for
whose protection and defense it

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.389
was intended."
The sovereign,

00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:51.194
he says, or Leviathan,
this great artificial man,

00:25:51.194 --> 00:25:56.188
the sovereign is something more
like what we would call today an

00:25:56.188 --> 00:25:59.349
office,
rather than a person,

00:25:59.349 --> 00:26:04.400
as when we speak of the
executive as an office.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.913
And it is simply the person who
inhabits the office,

00:26:08.913 --> 00:26:14.046
although that might be somewhat
questionable in some of our

00:26:14.046 --> 00:26:18.263
recent executive decisions.
But for Hobbes,

00:26:18.263 --> 00:26:24.549
Hobbes creates this office of a
political called the sovereign.

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:29.462
Now, his language in that
sentence that I just read from

00:26:29.462 --> 00:26:32.410
the introduction,
"For by art",

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.488
again, "is created that great
Leviathan called a commonwealth

00:26:36.488 --> 00:26:40.437
or a state."
When Hobbes uses the term "art"

00:26:40.437 --> 00:26:46.529
there, "For by art is created,"
that term is deeply revealing of

00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:50.977
his purpose.
Again, for Aristotle,

00:26:50.977 --> 00:26:56.259
by contrast,
art presupposes nature.

00:26:56.259 --> 00:27:00.720
Or in other words,
nature precedes art.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.201
Nature supplies the standards,
the materials,

00:27:05.201 --> 00:27:08.970
the models, for all the later
arts,

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.067
the city being by nature,
man by nature,

00:27:12.067 --> 00:27:17.240
nature provides the standard.
Nature precedes art and human

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.987
artifice or human making.
But for Hobbes,

00:27:20.987 --> 00:27:25.731
think of this by contrast,
art does not so much imitate

00:27:25.731 --> 00:27:29.762
nature,
rather art can create a new

00:27:29.762 --> 00:27:33.966
kind of nature,
an artificial nature,

00:27:33.966 --> 00:27:38.170
an artificial person,
as it were.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.985
Through art,
again, is created the great

00:27:41.985 --> 00:27:45.660
Leviathan.
Through art properly understood

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.773
and by "art," of course,
I mean something like human

00:27:49.773 --> 00:27:52.241
making,
human ingenuity,

00:27:52.241 --> 00:27:56.916
human artfulness,
through art we can begin not

00:27:56.916 --> 00:28:01.223
just to imitate,
but we can transform nature,

00:28:01.223 --> 00:28:04.890
make it into something of our
own choosing.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:08.393
"Art" here is not to be
understood also as the

00:28:08.393 --> 00:28:12.285
antithesis of science,
as when we speak of the arts

00:28:12.285 --> 00:28:16.808
and the sciences.
Rather, science is the highest

00:28:16.808 --> 00:28:20.344
form of art.
Science is the highest kind of

00:28:20.344 --> 00:28:23.914
human making.
Science, or what Hobbes simply

00:28:23.914 --> 00:28:29.090
calls by the name "reason," is
simply the fullest expression of

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:33.546
human artfulness.
"Reason," he says in chapter 5,

00:28:33.546 --> 00:28:37.859
"reason is not a sense and
memory born with us,

00:28:37.859 --> 00:28:42.565
reason is not born with us,
nor gotten by experience only,"

00:28:42.565 --> 00:28:45.809
he says, "but is attained by
industry,

00:28:45.809 --> 00:28:50.229
first in the act imposing of
names and secondly,

00:28:50.229 --> 00:28:53.990
by getting a good and orderly
method."

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:58.398
Think of those terms.
"Reason," and again,

00:28:58.398 --> 00:29:03.120
he uses this synonymously with
other terms, like science or

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.926
art, is not simply born with us.
It is not simply a genetic

00:29:07.926 --> 00:29:11.914
endowment, nor is it simply the
product of experience,

00:29:11.914 --> 00:29:15.299
which Hobbes calls by the name
"prudence."

00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:19.623
But rather reason,
he says, is attained by

00:29:19.623 --> 00:29:24.579
industry, by work,
and it is developed first,

00:29:24.579 --> 00:29:28.308
he says, by the imposing of
names on things,

00:29:28.308 --> 00:29:33.165
the correct names on things,
and second by getting a good

00:29:33.165 --> 00:29:38.359
and orderly method of study.
Reason consists in the

00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:43.970
imposition of a method for the
conquest of nature.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:48.474
By science, Hobbes tells us,
he means the knowledge of

00:29:48.474 --> 00:29:51.109
consequences,
and especially,

00:29:51.109 --> 00:29:54.586
he goes on to say,
"when we see how anything comes

00:29:54.586 --> 00:29:57.779
about, upon what causes and by
what manner,

00:29:57.779 --> 00:30:02.265
when like causes come into our
power, we can see how to make it

00:30:02.265 --> 00:30:06.062
produce like effect."
We can see how to make it

00:30:06.062 --> 00:30:09.938
produce like effects.
Reason, science,

00:30:09.938 --> 00:30:16.432
art is the capacity to
transform nature by making it,

00:30:16.432 --> 00:30:21.294
imposing on it,
a method that will produce like

00:30:21.294 --> 00:30:24.329
effects after similar
consequences.

00:30:24.329 --> 00:30:27.877
There is, in other words,
a kind of a radically

00:30:27.877 --> 00:30:32.349
transformative view of reason
and knowledge and science,

00:30:32.349 --> 00:30:34.352
political science,
civil science,

00:30:34.352 --> 00:30:36.480
running throughout Hobbes'
work.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.702
Reason is not about simple
observation, but rather,

00:30:40.702 --> 00:30:43.490
it is about making,
production,

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:47.038
or as he says,
"making like consequences

00:30:47.038 --> 00:30:51.356
produce the desired effects."
We can have a science of

00:30:51.356 --> 00:30:55.073
politics, Hobbes believes.
We can have a civil science,

00:30:55.073 --> 00:30:58.269
because politics is a matter of
human making,

00:30:58.269 --> 00:31:01.030
of human doing,
of human goings on.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.703
We can know the political world.
We can create a science of

00:31:05.703 --> 00:31:10.029
politics because we make it.
It is something constructed by

00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:11.882
us.
Hobbes' goal here,

00:31:11.882 --> 00:31:16.868
as it were, is to liberate
knowledge, to liberate science

00:31:16.868 --> 00:31:22.210
from subservience or dependence
upon nature or by chance,

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:26.397
by fortuna,
by turning science into a tool

00:31:26.397 --> 00:31:29.799
for remaking nature to fit our
needs,

00:31:29.799 --> 00:31:37.309
to impose our needs or satisfy
our needs through our science.

00:31:37.309 --> 00:31:39.851
Art, and especially the
political art,

00:31:39.851 --> 00:31:43.559
is a matter of reordering
nature, even human nature,

00:31:43.559 --> 00:31:47.915
first according to Hobbes,
by resolving it into its most

00:31:47.915 --> 00:31:51.558
elementary units,
and then by reconstructing it

00:31:51.558 --> 00:31:55.359
so that it will produce the
desired results,

00:31:55.359 --> 00:32:00.009
much like a physicist in a
laboratory might.

00:32:00.009 --> 00:32:04.355
This is Hobbes' answer to
Machiavelli's famous call in

00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:07.224
chapter 25 to master
fortuna,

00:32:07.224 --> 00:32:10.339
to master chance or luck,
fortune.

00:32:10.339 --> 00:32:13.115
But you might say,
Hobbes goes further than

00:32:13.115 --> 00:32:16.263
Machiavelli.
Machiavelli said in that famous

00:32:16.263 --> 00:32:19.490
chapter 25, that the prince,
if he is lucky,

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:23.384
will master fortuna
about half the time,

00:32:23.384 --> 00:32:27.708
only about 50% of the time.
The rest of human action,

00:32:27.708 --> 00:32:31.669
the rest of statecraft,
will be really left to chance,

00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:34.359
luck, contingency,
circumstances.

00:32:34.359 --> 00:32:38.104
Hobbes believes that armed with
the proper method,

00:32:38.104 --> 00:32:41.619
with the proper art,
or scientific doctrine,

00:32:41.619 --> 00:32:46.602
that we might eventually become
the masters and possessors of

00:32:46.602 --> 00:32:49.155
nature.
And I use that term "masters

00:32:49.155 --> 00:32:52.829
and possessors of nature," a
term not of Hobbes' making,

00:32:52.829 --> 00:32:56.549
but of Descartes from the sixth
part of the Discourse on

00:32:56.549 --> 00:33:00.204
Method, because I think it
perfectly expresses Hobbes'

00:33:00.204 --> 00:33:03.336
aspirations,
not only to create a science of

00:33:03.336 --> 00:33:07.210
politics, but to create a kind
of immortal commonwealth,

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:11.213
which is based on science and
therefore based on the proper

00:33:11.213 --> 00:33:13.629
civil science,
and therefore will be

00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:18.617
impervious to fluctuation,
decay, and war and conflict,

00:33:18.617 --> 00:33:24.140
which all other previous
societies have experienced.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.353
You can begin to see,
in other words,

00:33:27.353 --> 00:33:31.279
in Hobbes' brief introduction
to his book,

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:36.916
as well as the opening
chapters, you can really see the

00:33:36.916 --> 00:33:42.657
immensely transformative and
really revolutionary spirit

00:33:42.657 --> 00:33:46.610
underlying this amazing,
amazing book.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.610
So where do we go from here?

00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:05.950
We turn from methodology and
science to politics.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:18.973
What is Hobbes' great question?
What was important when

00:34:18.973 --> 00:34:24.054
reading, starting out with a new
book, asking yourself,

00:34:24.054 --> 00:34:28.570
what question is the author
trying to answer?

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:32.141
What is the question?
And it is not always easy to

00:34:32.141 --> 00:34:36.951
answer, because sometimes they
do not always make their deepest

00:34:36.951 --> 00:34:40.830
or most fundamental questions
altogether clear.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.050
In the case of
Leviathan,

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:52.102
I would suggest to you,
Hobbes' central question is,

00:34:52.102 --> 00:34:55.470
what makes authority possible?

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:04.809
What is the source of authority?
And you might say,

00:35:04.809 --> 00:35:10.018
what renders it legitimate?
Maybe the question is,

00:35:10.018 --> 00:35:13.280
what makes legitimate authority
possible?

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:19.138
This is still a huge question
for us when we think about

00:35:19.138 --> 00:35:24.997
nation building and building new
states, how to create a

00:35:24.997 --> 00:35:29.046
legitimate authority.
Obviously, there is a

00:35:29.046 --> 00:35:31.820
tremendous issue with this in
Iraq today.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:36.810
People there and here struggle
with what would constitute a

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:40.727
legitimate authority.
Perhaps we should airlift

00:35:40.727 --> 00:35:45.377
copies of Leviathan to
them, because that is the issue

00:35:45.377 --> 00:35:49.020
that Hobbes is fundamentally
concerned with.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:54.587
His question goes further.
How can individuals who are

00:35:54.587 --> 00:36:00.321
biologically autonomous,
who judge and see matters very

00:36:00.321 --> 00:36:06.051
differently from one another,
who can never be sure whether

00:36:06.051 --> 00:36:10.391
they trust one another,
how can such individuals accept

00:36:10.391 --> 00:36:14.011
a common authority?
And, again, that is not just

00:36:14.011 --> 00:36:17.384
what constitutes authority,
but what makes authority

00:36:17.384 --> 00:36:19.800
legitimate.
That remains not only the

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.960
fundamental question for Hobbes,
but for the entire,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:29.500
at least for the entire social
contract tradition that he

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:33.005
helped to establish.
You might say,

00:36:33.005 --> 00:36:36.010
of course the question,
what renders authority

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:39.416
legitimate, is only possible,
or is only raised when

00:36:39.416 --> 00:36:42.552
authority is in question.
That is to say,

00:36:42.552 --> 00:36:46.555
when the rules governing
authority have broken down in

00:36:46.555 --> 00:36:49.762
times of crisis,
and that was certainly true in

00:36:49.762 --> 00:36:52.480
Hobbes' time,
a time of civil war and crisis.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:56.849
What renders authority
legitimate or respectable?

00:36:56.849 --> 00:37:01.929
And to answer that question,
Hobbes tells a story.

00:37:01.929 --> 00:37:07.360
He tells a story about
something he calls "the state of

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.980
nature," a term he did not
invent,

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.415
but with which his name will
always and forever be

00:37:15.415 --> 00:37:19.579
associated, the idea of the
state of nature.

00:37:19.579 --> 00:37:23.601
"The state of nature" is not a
gift of grace or a state of

00:37:23.601 --> 00:37:29.091
grace from which we have fallen,
as in the biblical account of

00:37:29.091 --> 00:37:35.059
Eden, nor is the state of nature
a political condition,

00:37:35.059 --> 00:37:38.895
as maintained in some sense by
Aristotle, when he says the

00:37:38.895 --> 00:37:43.039
polis is by nature.
The state of nature for Hobbes

00:37:43.039 --> 00:37:45.750
is a condition of conflict and
war.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:53.520
And by a "state of nature" he
means, or by a state of war,

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.262
he means a condition where
there is no recognized authority

00:37:58.262 --> 00:38:01.370
in his language to keep us in
awe,

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:06.778
no authority to awe us.
Such a condition,

00:38:06.778 --> 00:38:10.695
a state of war,
may mean a condition of open

00:38:10.695 --> 00:38:15.456
warfare, but not necessarily.
It can signify battle,

00:38:15.456 --> 00:38:20.239
but Hobbes says it can also
signify the will to contend,

00:38:20.239 --> 00:38:24.694
simply the desire or the will
to engage in conflict,

00:38:24.694 --> 00:38:28.449
renders something like a state
of nature.

00:38:28.449 --> 00:38:31.052
A state of war can include,
in other words,

00:38:31.052 --> 00:38:33.159
what we might call a "cold
war,"

00:38:33.159 --> 00:38:38.560
two hostile sides looking at
each other across a barrier of

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:44.239
some type, not clear or not
certain what the other will do.

00:38:44.239 --> 00:38:48.103
So the state of nature is not
necessarily a condition of

00:38:48.103 --> 00:38:51.053
actual fighting,
but what he calls a "known

00:38:51.053 --> 00:38:55.030
disposition to fight."
If you are known or believed to

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:58.360
be willing to fight,
you are in a state of war.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:04.541
It is a condition for Hobbes of
maximum insecurity where in his

00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:08.329
famous formula "life is
solitary, poor,

00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:11.420
nasty, brutish,
and short."

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:15.400
Perhaps he should have said
fortunately short.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.135
This is the natural condition,
the state of nature,

00:39:20.135 --> 00:39:24.113
the state of war that Hobbes
attributes to,

00:39:24.113 --> 00:39:28.660
again, the fundamental fact of
human nature.

00:39:32.449 --> 00:39:36.705
Now, his claim that the state
of nature is the condition that

00:39:36.705 --> 00:39:39.329
we are naturally--the state of
war,

00:39:39.329 --> 00:39:42.852
rather, is a condition that we
are naturally in,

00:39:42.852 --> 00:39:47.994
is to say, among other things,
that nature does not unite us

00:39:47.994 --> 00:39:51.307
in peace, in harmony,
in friendship,

00:39:51.307 --> 00:39:54.974
or in solidarity.
If nature is a norm,

00:39:54.974 --> 00:39:58.790
it does not,
again, mandate or incline us to

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:03.050
peace, friendship and solidarity
with others.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:07.714
Only human art or science or
art, human contrivance,

00:40:07.714 --> 00:40:12.170
can bring about peace.
Conflict and war are primary.

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:16.834
Peace is derivative.
In other words,

00:40:16.834 --> 00:40:21.711
for Hobbes, authority and
relations of authority do not

00:40:21.711 --> 00:40:25.438
arise naturally among us,
but are rather,

00:40:25.438 --> 00:40:29.192
again, like civil science
itself, the product of

00:40:29.192 --> 00:40:34.249
contrivance or art.
So the question for us remains,

00:40:34.249 --> 00:40:39.889
which deeply challenged readers
in Hobbes' own time,

00:40:39.889 --> 00:40:42.854
what makes Hobbes' story,
as I am calling it,

00:40:42.854 --> 00:40:47.100
his story about the state of
nature being a condition of war,

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.987
what makes it plausible?
What makes it believable as an

00:40:50.987 --> 00:40:54.936
account of, again,
the condition we are naturally

00:40:54.936 --> 00:40:55.430
in?

00:40:59.539 --> 00:41:04.810
Why should we believe Hobbes'
story and not some other story?

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:18.639
I just want to say a word about
that before closing.

00:41:18.639 --> 00:41:21.898
From one point of view,
reading Hobbes,

00:41:21.898 --> 00:41:26.871
his account of the state of
nature seems to derive from his

00:41:26.871 --> 00:41:30.493
physics of motion and rest,
in the opening chapters of

00:41:30.493 --> 00:41:32.915
Leviathan.
He begins the work,

00:41:32.915 --> 00:41:36.334
you remember,
with an account of human

00:41:36.334 --> 00:41:41.047
nature, account of human
psychology, as a product of

00:41:41.047 --> 00:41:45.114
sense and experience.
We are bodies in motion,

00:41:45.114 --> 00:41:48.788
and who cannot help but obey
the law or the physics of

00:41:48.788 --> 00:41:53.230
attraction and repulsion.
We are bodies in constant

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:55.917
motion.
He seems, in other words,

00:41:55.917 --> 00:42:00.145
to have a kind of materialistic
psychology in which human

00:42:00.145 --> 00:42:04.090
behavior exhibits the same,
as it were, mechanical

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:08.139
tendencies as billiard balls
that can be understood as

00:42:08.139 --> 00:42:11.447
obeying,
again, geometric or causal

00:42:11.447 --> 00:42:15.829
processes of cause and effect.
Right?

00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:20.724
The state of nature is not seen
by him as an actual historical

00:42:20.724 --> 00:42:25.026
condition in some ways,
although he occasionally will

00:42:25.026 --> 00:42:29.856
refer to what we might think of
as anthropological evidence to

00:42:29.856 --> 00:42:33.340
support his views on the state
of nature.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:37.445
But the state of nature,
for him, is rather a kind of

00:42:37.445 --> 00:42:42.340
thought experiment after the
manner of experimental science.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.719
It is a kind of thought
experiment.

00:42:43.719 --> 00:42:47.880
It consists of taking human
beings who are members of

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.760
families, of estates,
of kingdoms,

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:54.812
and so on, dissolving these
social relations into their

00:42:54.812 --> 00:42:57.589
fundamental units,
namely the abstract

00:42:57.589 --> 00:43:00.029
individuals,
and then imagining,

00:43:00.029 --> 00:43:03.161
again, in the manner of a
chemist or a physicist,

00:43:03.161 --> 00:43:07.011
how these basic units would
hypothetically interact with one

00:43:07.011 --> 00:43:09.263
another,
again almost like the

00:43:09.263 --> 00:43:12.469
properties of chemical
substances in some ways.

00:43:12.469 --> 00:43:18.239
How would we behave in this
kind of thought experiment?

00:43:18.239 --> 00:43:24.418
That would be one way of
reading that Hobbes seems to,

00:43:24.418 --> 00:43:30.829
wants us to think about the
state of nature as akin to a

00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:34.986
scientific experiment.
Hobbes is the,

00:43:34.986 --> 00:43:38.686
again, the great founder of
what we might call,

00:43:38.686 --> 00:43:42.065
among others,
is the experimental method in

00:43:42.065 --> 00:43:46.205
social and political science.
And there is a reason,

00:43:46.205 --> 00:43:48.250
perhaps a reason for this,
too.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.110
And I will end just on this
note.

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:55.059
When Hobbes was a young man,
he worked as a private

00:43:55.059 --> 00:44:00.955
secretary for a short time,
a private secretary to another

00:44:00.955 --> 00:44:06.300
very famous Englishman by the
name of Francis Bacon,

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:10.610
the great founder of what we
think of as the experimental

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:13.690
method, the method of trial and
error,

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:18.893
of experience and experiment,
and arguably Hobbes was

00:44:18.893 --> 00:44:23.997
influenced in many ways by
Bacon's own philosophy of

00:44:23.997 --> 00:44:29.511
experience and experiment.
And Hobbes took Bacon's method

00:44:29.511 --> 00:44:34.199
in some ways applying it to
politics, tried to imagine,

00:44:34.199 --> 00:44:38.133
again, the natural condition of
human beings,

00:44:38.133 --> 00:44:43.230
and what we are by nature,
by a process of abstraction,

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:49.630
and abstracting all of the
relations and properties that we

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:53.756
have acquired over history,
through custom,

00:44:53.756 --> 00:44:56.721
through experience,
stripping those away like the

00:44:56.721 --> 00:44:59.722
layers of an onion,
and putting us almost,

00:44:59.722 --> 00:45:04.500
as it were, in an experimental
test tube or under a microscope,

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:09.850
seeing how we would under those
conditions react and behave with

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:13.034
one another.
I will leave it at that,

00:45:13.034 --> 00:45:17.853
although I will start next week
by showing how that view of

00:45:17.853 --> 00:45:21.510
Hobbes is only at best partially
correct.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:26.391
So anyway, have a wonderful
weekend with your parents here,

00:45:26.391 --> 00:45:28.391
and I will see you next week.

00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:02.933
PAUL FREEDMAN: Today,
we're going to talk

00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:08.267
about what is arguably the most
important event of the

00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:11.400
first part of our course, the
conversion of Constantine, the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.167
Roman emperor, to
Christianity.

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:17.167
Important not because
of Constantine's

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:19.267
own particular opinions.

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:22.467
The fact that he embraced
Christianity is, as we'll see,

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.533
a little hard to explain on
purely strategic grounds.

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.600
But its importance is that it
represents a permanent change.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.733
It represents the beginning of
the Christianization of the

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:36.633
Roman Empire, a very
unexpected result.

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:40.333
Because not only had
Christianity been illegal in

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:45.167
the prior history of the empire,
that is to say, for

00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:52.200
over 250 years, but of course,
the god-man Jesus had been put

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.467
to death by the forces
of the Roman Empire.

00:00:56.467 --> 00:01:01.500
And as we've discussed, Roman
religion, with its emphasis on

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.100
what we've called "civic
polytheism" or the performance

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.733
of ceremonies in public,
ceremonies that have to do

00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:13.400
with local patriotism, emperor
worship, the tradition of the

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.633
Olympian gods, and, above all,
polytheism, was very foreign

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.667
to Christianity.

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:24.833
The Christian religion thus
seemed to be a kind of

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:30.967
annoying epiphenomenon of Roman
society when, in fact,

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:38.100
with this event, Constantine's
conversion, it becomes first a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.433
tolerated religion, then a
favored religion, and very

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:48.967
quickly, within the course of
the fourth century AD, the

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:53.867
official and almost the only
religion of the Roman Empire.

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:55.967
How can this be?

00:01:55.967 --> 00:02:00.433
We'll discuss both the specific
events today, and

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:04.600
their meaning, and how
they play out.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.000
We recall then that what
is called "paganism," a

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.933
traditional religion of
the Roman Empire, was

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:17.067
polytheistic, was many gods,
ceremonial, had a lot of local

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:21.433
variation, and it
was eclectic--

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:25.333
eclectic meaning that you could
worship different gods

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:29.233
in different places, different
gods for different purposes,

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:32.267
different gods for different
times of your life.

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:44.267
There was a certain emotional
vacuum, or at least a

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:47.633
perceived vacuum, in this
religion because it seemed to

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:53.333
deny individual longing and
longing in general, that

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:58.333
longing, that sense internally
that there is more to life

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:01.333
than there appears to be.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:04.267
So that many adherents of other
religions, including,

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.967
but not limited to, Christianity
believed that

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:13.833
some part of their body was
immortal, or the soul was

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:17.700
immortal, or that the immortal
soul had to be healed by

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.500
religion, and not that religion
should simply be a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.700
pathway to good fortune or to
easing the anxieties of the

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.900
material world.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.467
So Christianity, we've said, is
not so much otherworldly,

00:03:34.467 --> 00:03:36.433
focused on heaven.

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:37.600
It is that.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.667
But even more important perhaps
is its innerness, its

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:47.467
inner worldliness, the sense
that people have a interior

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:52.633
soul that yearns for something
eternal and more significant.

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:56.333
And then Christianity was
accompanied by other so-called

00:03:56.333 --> 00:04:00.833
"mystery religions," religions
that also spoke to an

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:08.700
immaterial, heroic, non-civic,
non-urban type of piety,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.533
Mithraism, for example,
the worship of the

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:15.967
mother goddess Cybele.

00:04:15.967 --> 00:04:20.367
Christianity had certain
advantages in terms of

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:24.733
reaching a population, the
promise of an afterlife, the

00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:28.867
commitment that it demanded
of people, a religion that

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:32.433
appealed both to the elite and
to the common people, and a

00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:36.433
very strong local
organization.

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:40.533
But Christianity was alien
to the Roman Empire.

00:04:40.533 --> 00:04:44.667
The Romans did not always
persecute Christianity, as

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:46.433
they did under Diocletian.

00:04:46.433 --> 00:04:50.400
But they found Christianity
alien.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.533
They didn't like the fact that
Christianity was intolerant.

00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:55.833
Every other religion of the
Roman Empire, with one

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:59.167
exception, accepted
other gods.

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:01.600
If you worshipped Isis, you
had nothing against other

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.200
people worshipping Jupiter.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.567
If you worshipped Cybele, you
had nothing against other

00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:07.467
people worshipping Mithra.

00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:10.533
But Christianity, of course,
ridiculed all of these gods.

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:14.267
The only other religion that
was like this was Judaism.

00:05:14.267 --> 00:05:16.800
But Judaism made some
accommodations with the Roman

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.200
Empire, recognized the authority
of the Roman

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.833
emperor, and did not defy the
state in the way that

00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:28.567
Christianity at least
appeared to.

00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:33.233
And Christianity was not a Roman
religion in many of the

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:37.833
ways that it rejected
worldliness, rejected

00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:43.933
engagement in or enjoyment of
the material world: the

00:05:43.933 --> 00:05:48.967
pleasures of the theater, the
circus, the celebrations of

00:05:48.967 --> 00:05:53.933
civic paganism, emperor
worship, law courts.

00:05:53.933 --> 00:05:56.067
Well, law courts may
not be pleasurable.

00:05:56.067 --> 00:05:59.967
But this sort of civic
involvement of the emperor and

00:05:59.967 --> 00:06:02.967
the Empire are rejected
by Christianity.

00:06:02.967 --> 00:06:07.133
Christianity, when you see what
Roman pagans write about

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.467
it, is a kind of killjoy
religion.

00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:13.667
It's a religion of people who
seem to have their eyes

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:17.733
focused on anything but the
actual process of getting

00:06:17.733 --> 00:06:20.800
ahead in Roman society.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.900
All of this notwithstanding, it
should be emphasized that

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.033
Christianity was not persecuted
constantly nor was

00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:31.333
the persecution very intense.

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:36.067
We have Nero in the late 60s AD,
the Decian persecution of

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:40.000
the mid-third century, and of
course, the great persecution

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.267
under Diocletian.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.467
Christianity received just
enough persecution, one might

00:06:46.467 --> 00:06:53.767
say, to fortify its spirit, to
give it some backbone, but not

00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:55.033
enough to break it.

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:03.700
Constantine emerged from the
chaos following Diocletian's

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.967
abdication.

00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:08.900
Diocletian, and as you'll
recall, had created this four

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.867
man rule, the Tetrarchy, in
order to divide what was

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:17.833
perceived as an excessively
large empire with an

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:20.600
excessively large administrative
structure.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.267
The Tetrarchy was, at least we
can say with hindsight, doomed

00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:26.333
to failure.

00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:29.467
These four emperors would
not cooperate.

00:07:29.467 --> 00:07:32.400
They would tend to be rivals.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.067
Constantine was the son of one
of the caesars, one of the

00:07:36.067 --> 00:07:37.000
subordinates.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.867
Remember there were two
augusti, two caesars.

00:07:39.867 --> 00:07:43.500
His father was Constantius
Chlorus who was appointed when

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.500
the Tetrarchy began in
the West in 293.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.367
So there was an Augustus of the
West and a Caesar of the

00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:55.833
West. The Caesar of the West
was Constantius Chlorus.

00:07:55.833 --> 00:08:00.767
The young Constantine was sent
east to serve the eastern

00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:05.233
Augustus, who succeeded
Diocletian, Galerius.

00:08:14.067 --> 00:08:17.933
Constantine was left out
of the succession

00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:21.067
when Diocletian abdicated.

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:23.833
Galerius appointed
somebody else,

00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:25.933
and Constantine rebelled.

00:08:25.933 --> 00:08:33.767
Constantine, in 306, raised an
army in faraway Britain,

00:08:33.767 --> 00:08:37.400
marched on Gaul, and eventually
was grudgingly

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.167
recognized by Galerius
as caesar.

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:44.333
At the same time, another
disinherited son of an

00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:50.933
augustus, a man named Maxentius,
rebelled in Rome.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:01.000
And I will not burden you with
the whole working out of these

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.400
intrigues, of the fightings of
armies, of the quarrels of

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.300
augusti and caesars.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:12.867
But basically, in 311, Galerius,
who had been ill

00:09:12.867 --> 00:09:15.333
with cancer, died.

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:19.333
And Galerius was succeeded
by an emperor in

00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:23.367
the East named Licinius.

00:09:23.367 --> 00:09:27.467
And Licinius allowed Constantine
to deal with the

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:32.033
usurper Maxentius in the West.
So we have Licinius in the

00:09:32.033 --> 00:09:35.367
east in 311, and then in the
West, Constantine and

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:37.367
Maxentius fighting it out.

00:09:37.367 --> 00:09:40.067
Galerius has died.

00:09:40.067 --> 00:09:45.733
Constantine defeated Maxentius
at a battle not far from Rome,

00:09:45.733 --> 00:09:47.633
the Battle of the
Milvian Bridge.

00:09:58.733 --> 00:10:01.767
The Battle of the Milvian
Bridge in 312.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:04.933
And Constantine was now
Augustus in the West,

00:10:04.933 --> 00:10:08.533
Licinius, Augustus in the
East. The Battle of the

00:10:08.533 --> 00:10:13.867
Milvian Bridge is the context
for whatever had happened that

00:10:13.867 --> 00:10:16.933
changed Constantine's mind
about his religious

00:10:16.933 --> 00:10:19.033
orientation.

00:10:19.033 --> 00:10:20.767
Just before the Battle
of the Milvian

00:10:20.767 --> 00:10:23.233
Bridge, something happened.

00:10:23.233 --> 00:10:27.167
There are two stories that
purport to explain the event.

00:10:27.167 --> 00:10:31.133
One is that Constantine
had a dream.

00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:34.433
And in this dream, an angel
spoke to him and ordered him

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:41.267
to paint a symbol combining the
Greek letter chi and the

00:10:41.267 --> 00:10:53.200
Greek letter rho on his
soldiers' shields.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.833
The rho, the R in Greek, and the
chi written as an X. The

00:10:57.833 --> 00:11:02.667
two letters symbolize, or at
least were taken later to

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:08.333
symbolize, Christ, the first
letter being a chi,

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:09.600
the second a rho.

00:11:12.333 --> 00:11:17.633
The second version, which is
later, that is, later in

00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:21.600
circulation as a story, but
seems perhaps to have been

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.333
attested by the emperor
himself to

00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:27.500
his biographer, Eusebius.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.000
According to Eusebius,
Constantine was marching with

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.800
his army before the battle.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.767
And he, along with the army,
saw a cross in the sky.

00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:44.500
And superimposed on the sun,
against which background the

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.500
cross appeared, were the words,
"In this sign, you will

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:58.633
conquer." Hard to say which
version, if either, is what

00:11:58.633 --> 00:12:02.100
Constantine thought
happened to him.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.333
The argument for the second
one is partly Eusebius's

00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:08.633
description, partly the fact
that angels in a dream are a

00:12:08.633 --> 00:12:13.433
standard kind of story.

00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:16.600
On the other hand, the Chi Rho
symbol is not previously a

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.867
sign of Christianity.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:26.433
So the very fact that there
isn't a background to that,

00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:30.933
that this is something that we
hear of now for the first

00:12:30.933 --> 00:12:33.967
time, might indicate that
that's the true story.

00:12:33.967 --> 00:12:39.100
But more important than what
actually happened is that

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:45.133
there's no reason to doubt
Constantine's sincerity.

00:12:45.133 --> 00:12:48.967
There is no reason to believe
that this was a calculating,

00:12:48.967 --> 00:12:54.233
cynical, or politically
astute move.

00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:57.067
This is not because Constantine
wasn't devious.

00:12:57.067 --> 00:12:58.867
He was.

00:12:58.867 --> 00:13:03.033
But because it's hard to imagine
any emperor thinking

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:04.767
that Christianity
was a good idea.

00:13:07.667 --> 00:13:11.767
Because Christianity was
subversive of Roman values.

00:13:11.767 --> 00:13:15.033
And it was particularly
subversive of the values of

00:13:15.033 --> 00:13:21.233
the Roman army, whose crucial
aid Constantine depended on

00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:25.333
and of which Constantine had to
be the leader not only in

00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:30.767
order to defeat Maxentius, but
simply to survive in power.

00:13:30.767 --> 00:13:34.700
Christianity was pacifist. At
this time, it took more

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.767
literally than it would later
the admonitions of Christ in

00:13:39.767 --> 00:13:48.233
the Gospels not to fight, not
to hit back, not to engage

00:13:48.233 --> 00:13:51.400
oneself in the pursuit
of worldly

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.667
gain by means of violence.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:14:00.333
So it's hard to imagine anything
more unlikely than an

00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:02.633
emperor becoming Christian
and gaining the

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:07.567
support of his followers.

00:14:07.567 --> 00:14:11.233
Now that doesn't mean that
Constantine became some sort

00:14:11.233 --> 00:14:15.167
of monk, interpreted the Gospels
literally, told his

00:14:15.167 --> 00:14:17.133
soldiers to put down
their weapons.

00:14:17.133 --> 00:14:20.967
It's clear that Constantine
regarded the Christian god

00:14:20.967 --> 00:14:24.433
much as other emperors had
regarded, say, the Invincible

00:14:24.433 --> 00:14:28.567
Sun, or the genius of the divine
emperor, or any other

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:32.467
pagan deity that brought
victory in war.

00:14:32.467 --> 00:14:35.933
Constantine, like all emperors,
saw himself as a

00:14:35.933 --> 00:14:40.267
child a fortune, as someone who
was favored by fortune,

00:14:40.267 --> 00:14:47.433
depended on fortune, and who
needed to placate, to mollify,

00:14:47.433 --> 00:14:52.867
to please whatever god it was
that controlled fortune.

00:14:52.867 --> 00:14:55.900
What's unusual is that he would
deem the Christian god

00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:01.000
to be this sort of god, a leader
of war, a giver of

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.400
victory in battle, a companion
to the emperor.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.133
None of this would seem, at
first glance, to be likely in

00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:13.100
Christianity.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.133
The fact that not only does it
work, but that it would work

00:15:16.133 --> 00:15:21.300
for centuries later is just part
of the cataclysmic nature

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.833
of this event, or if not
cataclysmic, at least

00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:26.100
unexpected.

00:15:28.233 --> 00:15:29.700
Constantine was not ignorant.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:34.233
He's someone who had studied
philosophy, who was quite

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:38.233
literate, knew Greek pretty
well, familiar with Latin

00:15:38.233 --> 00:15:40.533
literature.

00:15:40.533 --> 00:15:43.333
But nevertheless, he was
obviously a man of affairs.

00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:47.600
He's not an intellectual,
contemplative person, poring

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.833
over philosophy books.

00:15:48.833 --> 00:15:53.400
He's a man of power,
decisiveness, strategy, and

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.067
not a little cruelty
and brutality.

00:15:58.067 --> 00:16:01.800
And we can see that after his
conversion experience--

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.733
and indeed, I should point out
he did beat Maxentius--he

00:16:05.733 --> 00:16:11.700
accepted the Christian god,
he went to battle with the

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.233
usurper, and he defeated him.

00:16:15.233 --> 00:16:20.000
But even after his victory, he
doesn't become, in every

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.867
respect, a totally committed
Christian at least in terms of

00:16:24.867 --> 00:16:28.067
the symbols of power
of his office.

00:16:28.067 --> 00:16:32.200
His coins, for example, which
are a very good mark of

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:39.200
propaganda and self-regard, his
coins kept the imagery of

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.633
the earlier pagan deity
associated with the emperor,

00:16:42.633 --> 00:16:45.267
the Invincible Sun.

00:16:45.267 --> 00:16:47.633
After a little while, you start
to see the Invincible

00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:50.933
Sun on one side of the coin and
the cross on the other.

00:16:50.933 --> 00:16:54.967
And only later in his reign
do we have just the cross.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:04.567
Constantine's first substantive
act as a Christian

00:17:04.567 --> 00:17:09.367
or as someone who favored the
Christian church was the Edict

00:17:09.367 --> 00:17:10.333
of Tolerance.

00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:14.333
The Edict of Tolerance or Edict
of Toleration issued at

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:19.600
Milan in 313 was jointly the
product of Constantine and

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.567
Libanius, now the two
last guys standing.

00:17:23.567 --> 00:17:28.800
The Augustus of the East,
Libanius, and Constantine, the

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.467
Augustus of the West.

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.967
Libanius was a pagan.

00:17:32.967 --> 00:17:36.433
He did not share Constantine's
bizarre

00:17:36.433 --> 00:17:37.767
enthusiasm, but all right.

00:17:37.767 --> 00:17:41.233
If he wanted to tolerate
Christianity, this was fine.

00:17:41.233 --> 00:17:42.967
This was part of their--

00:17:42.967 --> 00:17:43.500
I'm sorry.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.000
It's not Libanius.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.533
Libanius is a philosopher.

00:17:48.533 --> 00:17:49.767
Licinius.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:54.667
Licinius.

00:17:54.667 --> 00:17:55.833
Constantine and Licinius.

00:17:55.833 --> 00:18:00.400
Licinius was a pagan, but he was
willing to go along with

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.200
toleration.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:07.933
At this point, Christianity
was legalized.

00:18:07.933 --> 00:18:11.933
But in the west, Constantine
came to favor the Church and

00:18:11.933 --> 00:18:14.933
do more than merely accept
it as legal.

00:18:14.933 --> 00:18:18.833
For example, he returned
property confiscated in the

00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:22.000
Diocletianic persecutions.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.133
He exempted the Church from
state taxation, an incredible

00:18:27.133 --> 00:18:31.833
gift, and allowed church
officials, bishops and others,

00:18:31.833 --> 00:18:34.900
to use the imperial
communications system, the

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.933
so-called post system whereby
they could get fresh horses to

00:18:38.933 --> 00:18:43.400
go from one place to another,
greatly speeding up their

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.833
journeys and making the
journeys, in effect,

00:18:47.833 --> 00:18:51.133
chargeable to the state.

00:18:51.133 --> 00:18:56.200
Constantine left the pagan and
ceremonial center of Rome

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.767
alone, for the time being at
least, and built two great

00:18:59.767 --> 00:19:01.767
basilicas on its outskirts.

00:19:01.767 --> 00:19:04.333
One, Saint Peter's.

00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:07.100
The St. Peter's that stands
today is, of course, a product

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.533
of the Renaissance
and the Baroque.

00:19:09.533 --> 00:19:14.567
But the old church that was
destroyed in the sixteenth

00:19:14.567 --> 00:19:18.367
century was that
of Constantine.

00:19:18.367 --> 00:19:20.900
And he also built the
Lateran Basilica.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:26.200
Both of these outside
the walls of Rome.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.033
As we'll discuss, he also
attempted to mediate in

00:19:30.033 --> 00:19:31.767
disputes involving the church.

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:36.867
He never, however, completely

00:19:36.867 --> 00:19:40.233
marginalized the old religions.

00:19:40.233 --> 00:19:43.367
He emphasized the diversity
of religious practice.

00:19:43.367 --> 00:19:46.000
He didn't require a single
form of worship.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.600
But by the time he died in 337,
the pace of conversions

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:56.100
was such that perhaps as much
as half of the Empire had

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.367
embraced Christianity.

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:05.667
And this brings us to a crucial
question, of course,

00:20:05.667 --> 00:20:07.833
that we'll be discussing
really throughout the

00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:12.233
semester, and that is what was
the effect of Constantine's

00:20:12.233 --> 00:20:14.267
conversion on the Church?

00:20:14.267 --> 00:20:19.767
Or beyond the mere event of 312,
what did it mean for the

00:20:19.767 --> 00:20:22.567
Church to go from persecuted
minority

00:20:22.567 --> 00:20:24.400
to established majority?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.333
What explains Constantine's
ability not only to change the

00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:38.133
course of the Roman religious
practice and tendencies, but

00:20:38.133 --> 00:20:41.200
to do so permanently?

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.100
For the Church, was this
turnaround a providential sign

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:50.733
or a kind of Trojan horse gift
in which the Church would now

00:20:50.733 --> 00:20:55.600
be so tied to the official
culture that it would never be

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.967
able to shake off Rome,
administration, and

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:04.733
bureaucracy to get back to its
original, charismatic,

00:21:04.733 --> 00:21:07.233
individual, powerful
foundations?

00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:13.467
The era of Constantine
establishes the problem of the

00:21:13.467 --> 00:21:16.633
Church in the world for
the Middle Ages

00:21:16.633 --> 00:21:17.767
and, indeed, beyond.

00:21:17.767 --> 00:21:23.233
This problem is is the church a
collection of special people

00:21:23.233 --> 00:21:27.367
who have their eyes fixed on
heaven or, is it a kind of

00:21:27.367 --> 00:21:32.933
universal society that is hard
to distinguish from just

00:21:32.933 --> 00:21:36.733
worldliness and engagement with
the world of business,

00:21:36.733 --> 00:21:42.033
life, death, and other
banalities?

00:21:42.033 --> 00:21:45.300
It is Saint Augustine who is
going to deal with this most

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.367
forcibly in terms of theory, but
that's a century later or

00:21:49.367 --> 00:21:52.867
so, well, 75 years later.

00:21:52.867 --> 00:21:59.900
Externally, the Church adapted
very quickly to success.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.633
We can see this in terms
of the pace of

00:22:02.633 --> 00:22:04.333
conversion, as I said.

00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:08.833
Not only were 50% of the people,
perhaps, Christian by

00:22:08.833 --> 00:22:14.700
337 when Constantine died, but
by 390, the time of the

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:21.733
Emperor Theodosius and his
death, 395, probably 90% of

00:22:21.733 --> 00:22:24.533
the population was at least
nominally Christian.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.967
The reasons for this success.

00:22:29.967 --> 00:22:32.867
In other words, how could
Constantine's particular

00:22:32.867 --> 00:22:36.133
gesture have such a
decisive impact?

00:22:38.867 --> 00:22:41.800
Some of this has to do with
Christianity's willingness to

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.233
adopt to the customs
of the Empire.

00:22:45.233 --> 00:22:48.333
Some of it may have to do with
the weakness of the official

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:51.667
religion of Rome and of the
urban elites who were its

00:22:51.667 --> 00:22:52.933
chief support.

00:22:56.767 --> 00:23:00.800
Those who held out against
Christianity were, on the one

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.833
hand, people in the rural areas,
so peasants, whose

00:23:06.833 --> 00:23:10.167
fundamental beliefs tended to
be directed to agriculture,

00:23:10.167 --> 00:23:13.900
local deities, deities that
controlled the weather, and

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.133
water, and things like that.

00:23:16.133 --> 00:23:20.100
The army, for reasons I've
just said, that is,

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.667
Christianity is not, at first
glance, congenial to people

00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:26.000
who fight for a living.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.733
And then the third group
that held out were the

00:23:28.733 --> 00:23:31.633
intelligentsia, particularly
of Roman and Athens, the

00:23:31.633 --> 00:23:37.233
people who had a substantial
cultural investment in Greek

00:23:37.233 --> 00:23:39.533
and Roman philosophy,
the intellectual

00:23:39.533 --> 00:23:41.433
side of the old elite.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.433
Well, Constantine fell
out with Licinius.

00:23:49.433 --> 00:23:52.633
And after some small skirmishes,
Constantine

00:23:52.633 --> 00:23:55.100
managed to defeat him
at a place called

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.800
Chrysopolis in 324.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.733
Licinius fled from the
battlefield, Constantine's

00:24:00.733 --> 00:24:04.400
forces caught up with him, and
Licinius was executed.

00:24:07.967 --> 00:24:13.467
This event, this Battle
of Chrysopolis,

00:24:13.467 --> 00:24:14.733
important in itself--

00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:21.900
P-O-L-I-S--

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.800
important in itself was even
more important because it

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.967
showed Constantine the
importance of the small

00:24:30.967 --> 00:24:35.300
fortress city of Byzantium,
not far away.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:48.167
Byzantium who is the ancestor
of the city that Constantine

00:24:48.167 --> 00:24:49.600
would found there,
Constantinople.

00:24:53.533 --> 00:24:59.400
And of course, modern
Istanbul in its

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.333
twenty-first century
incarnation.

00:25:03.333 --> 00:25:08.733
Byzantium commanded a strategic
point of access

00:25:08.733 --> 00:25:11.100
east-west and north-south.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:17.433
It was the point of access
between the Black Sea and the

00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:19.500
Mediterranean.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.733
The Bosphorus is a narrow
strait that

00:25:21.733 --> 00:25:24.233
separates Europe from Asia.

00:25:24.233 --> 00:25:30.867
Byzantium, Constantinople,
Istanbul stands on the west

00:25:30.867 --> 00:25:35.600
bank, the European side, but it
commands and controls the

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.200
channel by which anyone would
go from the Mediterranean to

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.233
the Black Sea.

00:25:40.233 --> 00:25:44.200
And since the Black Sea is the
gateway to central Asia, it,

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.500
in effect, controls
communications between two

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.733
commercial, strategic,
and military zones.

00:25:52.733 --> 00:25:59.400
It also controls the route from
the Balkans, southeastern

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.467
Europe, into Asia, into,
specifically in this case,

00:26:03.467 --> 00:26:09.700
Asia Minor or the Asian part
of what's now Turkey.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:14.000
Byzantium is, therefore,
strategically located in terms

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.833
of communication and, at the
same time, located so that an

00:26:20.833 --> 00:26:24.867
army can get to two of the most
dangerous frontiers of

00:26:24.867 --> 00:26:27.967
the Roman empire in a reasonable
amount of time

00:26:27.967 --> 00:26:30.100
without having to commit
itself to one

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.833
or the other totally.

00:26:31.833 --> 00:26:36.767
It is not far from the Danube
frontier, which was, as we

00:26:36.767 --> 00:26:41.100
said, one of the points at
which the empire met the

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.167
Barbarian tribes and which the
empire had sort of decided on

00:26:45.167 --> 00:26:47.433
as its natural frontier.

00:26:47.433 --> 00:26:51.367
And Constantinople was also not
that far from the eastern

00:26:51.367 --> 00:26:54.567
frontier of the Roman Empire,
the frontier with Persia,

00:26:54.567 --> 00:26:59.633
which ran along what's now
eastern Turkey, Armenia,

00:26:59.633 --> 00:27:02.400
western Iran, and Iraq.

00:27:05.733 --> 00:27:09.400
It was the city, also,
within the

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.400
richest part of the empire.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.133
As we said, one of the problems
of the Empire in its

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:18.600
later years, its later centuries
was that the east

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.800
was becoming richer, more
urban, more commercial.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.133
The west was lagging behind,
more rural, less successful in

00:27:27.133 --> 00:27:29.367
its commerce.

00:27:29.367 --> 00:27:34.733
Constantine wanted an eastern
capital for both strategic and

00:27:34.733 --> 00:27:36.300
for economic reasons.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.133
For strategic reasons having to
do with the movement of the

00:27:39.133 --> 00:27:42.000
armies and the protection
of the frontier.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.267
For economic reasons having
to do with taxation and

00:27:45.267 --> 00:27:46.700
administration.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:51.700
The city of Rome itself was
somewhat isolated, strangely

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.100
enough since, of course, the
whole empire had grown up

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.400
around Rome.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:02.067
But Rome was the historical
origin of the Empire, but not,

00:28:02.067 --> 00:28:08.733
in the fourth century AD, its
actual living capital.

00:28:08.733 --> 00:28:12.200
It would be too much to compare
it, say, to the

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.967
relationship between Portugal
and Brazil.

00:28:14.967 --> 00:28:17.333
It's not quite that lopsided.

00:28:17.333 --> 00:28:21.133
But Brazil is a former
colony of Portugal.

00:28:21.133 --> 00:28:23.600
They speak the language
of Portugal.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:28.133
Yet on the world stage, Brazil
is larger than Portugal, more

00:28:28.133 --> 00:28:33.333
important than Portugal, richer
now than Portugal.

00:28:33.333 --> 00:28:36.867
So whatever preeminence Portugal
or its capital,

00:28:36.867 --> 00:28:41.333
Lisbon, has within the world of
culture, no Brazilian would

00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:46.533
take Lisbon to be the be all and
end all of the Portuguese

00:28:46.533 --> 00:28:48.033
cultural world.

00:28:48.033 --> 00:28:52.733
So similarly, by this time, Rome
has become less important

00:28:52.733 --> 00:28:56.000
even within the western
empire.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.400
And this relocation of the
capital to Constantinople, the

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.600
relocation of the capital to
the east is significant

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.800
because it shows us
the permanent

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.933
result of the Tetrarchy.

00:29:10.933 --> 00:29:14.667
As we've said, Diocletian's
experiment was a failure in

00:29:14.667 --> 00:29:16.900
the sense that the emperors and

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.600
caesars would not cooperate.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.633
And such a scheme was
never tried again.

00:29:21.633 --> 00:29:27.267
But the division of the Empire
between east and west would be

00:29:27.267 --> 00:29:31.700
something that would eventually
become permanent.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.100
Its first traces are with
Diocletian, and that's one

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.533
reason why we begin the
course with him.

00:29:37.533 --> 00:29:42.300
It is also something that
continues under Constantine

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:46.633
without the addition
of the caesars.

00:29:46.633 --> 00:29:48.500
Constantine ruled over
the whole empire.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.067
He did not divide it himself,
but he facilitated its

00:29:52.067 --> 00:29:55.900
conceptual, and eventually real,
political division by

00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:02.733
creating a new Rome, a new
capital in the former fortress

00:30:02.733 --> 00:30:09.100
of Byzantium, a town that he
modestly named after himself.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.967
Constantinople, as this town was
called, was planned to be

00:30:12.967 --> 00:30:14.933
a new Rome.

00:30:14.933 --> 00:30:19.333
Like Rome, it would have a
forum; it would have civic

00:30:19.333 --> 00:30:24.267
spaces; it would have races
and sporting events.

00:30:24.267 --> 00:30:28.267
It would have imperial palaces
and gardens; it would have

00:30:28.267 --> 00:30:33.967
victory columns, triumphal
arches, aqueducts, the whole

00:30:33.967 --> 00:30:37.233
panoply of classical
civilization.

00:30:37.233 --> 00:30:39.900
It wouldn't have a whole
lot of temples.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.233
Churches would be more important
than temples, not

00:30:42.233 --> 00:30:45.033
that Constantine totally
banned temples from

00:30:45.033 --> 00:30:46.133
Constantinople.

00:30:46.133 --> 00:30:51.000
But these were not the
highlights of the city.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.667
It is an ideological statement
like other planned, great,

00:30:56.667 --> 00:30:58.900
imperial sites.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.767
So we could compare it to, in
the modern world, Saint

00:31:02.767 --> 00:31:06.733
Petersburg, created by the czars
as a certain kind of

00:31:06.733 --> 00:31:10.933
statement, with a certain kind
of plan, and a certain kind of

00:31:10.933 --> 00:31:15.267
look evoking western Europe
in particular.

00:31:15.267 --> 00:31:19.100
Or Versailles, not a town at
all, but rather a kind of

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.300
palace city fit for the
king of France.

00:31:28.867 --> 00:31:35.333
At this point, Constantine
becomes considerably more

00:31:35.333 --> 00:31:38.867
devout and somewhat
more intolerant.

00:31:38.867 --> 00:31:45.667
We start to see him interact
with the Christian Church in

00:31:45.667 --> 00:31:51.933
its most intimate way, that
is to say, doctrine.

00:31:51.933 --> 00:31:59.000
Constantine is appealed to by
the Donatists, schismatics--

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.600
well, we're calling
them schismatics--

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.433
or heretics, as they
were decided to

00:32:02.433 --> 00:32:03.933
be, from North Africa.

00:32:06.833 --> 00:32:18.133
The Donatists taught that the
priests who had given over the

00:32:18.133 --> 00:32:21.933
scriptures under persecution at
the time of Diocletian were

00:32:21.933 --> 00:32:23.533
not legitimate priests.

00:32:23.533 --> 00:32:26.767
And we'll talk later about
the implications of this.

00:32:26.767 --> 00:32:32.133
The implications, briefly, are
that the Church cannot cover

00:32:32.133 --> 00:32:36.467
for priests, that the office is
not greater than the man.

00:32:36.467 --> 00:32:41.700
If the man has committed a sin,
such as what was called

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.367
treason, the handing over
of the scriptures to the

00:32:44.367 --> 00:32:48.733
persecutors, he no longer can
baptize validly, he no longer

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:52.300
can perform the sacraments
with validity.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:58.267
Donatism, then, implies that
the Church itself is really

00:32:58.267 --> 00:33:04.400
just as good as the character
of its officials.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.033
The Donatists were strong in
North Africa, and they appeal

00:33:08.033 --> 00:33:12.800
to Constantine against decisions
that had been made

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.467
against them within
the Church.

00:33:15.467 --> 00:33:19.333
The fact that Christians are
appealing to the emperor

00:33:19.333 --> 00:33:25.067
already, as early as 317, shows
the acceptance of the

00:33:25.067 --> 00:33:27.167
emperor as a Christian
arbiter.

00:33:27.167 --> 00:33:32.267
But it also shows a kind of,
in retrospect, dangerous

00:33:32.267 --> 00:33:34.700
intermingling of what
we would consider to

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.433
be church and state.

00:33:37.433 --> 00:33:41.900
Similarly, Constantine would get
involved in controversies

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.333
over the relationship between
God, the Father,

00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:46.700
and Christ, the Son.

00:33:49.233 --> 00:33:52.233
This, too, we'll go into in more
detail, but this is the

00:33:52.233 --> 00:33:53.400
Arian heresy--

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.733
Arian with an "i,"
not with a "y"--

00:33:56.733 --> 00:34:03.833
named after a priest named Arius
who taught that while

00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:07.567
Christ is God, he is,
in some sense,

00:34:07.567 --> 00:34:10.800
subordinate to God the Father.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.833
This is a controversy over the
nature of the Trinity in which

00:34:16.833 --> 00:34:22.500
Christ is seen as coming from
God, as emanating from God.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.633
And as I think I warned at the
beginning of the course, if

00:34:26.633 --> 00:34:31.467
you don't like doctrinal and
theological controversy, I'll

00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:34.767
try to spare you all its ins and
outs, but you can't teach

00:34:34.767 --> 00:34:37.167
this course without it.

00:34:37.167 --> 00:34:40.033
Again, what we're talking about
now is not the content

00:34:40.033 --> 00:34:44.167
of Arianism, who embraced it,
why, but the fact that the

00:34:44.167 --> 00:34:49.100
Emperor gets involved in
these controversies.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:54.167
On the one hand, this shows the
quick adaptation of the

00:34:54.167 --> 00:34:56.533
Church to imperial rule.

00:34:56.533 --> 00:34:59.467
On the other hand, because
Constantine was able to solve

00:34:59.467 --> 00:35:03.233
neither the Donatist nor the
Arian division, at least not

00:35:03.233 --> 00:35:07.700
definitively, and at least not
yet, it shows how difficult it

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.633
was for an emperor who could
conquer all of his secular

00:35:10.633 --> 00:35:16.367
rivals, who could control this
vast realm from Gibraltar to

00:35:16.367 --> 00:35:20.467
the Tigris and Euphrates, but
couldn't get a bunch of North

00:35:20.467 --> 00:35:24.933
African peasants to obey his
orders about how to worship or

00:35:24.933 --> 00:35:26.433
Egyptian priests either.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:34.900
Constantine, we can see,
is frustrated by this.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.833
You can see in the reading from
Jones, his difficulties

00:35:38.833 --> 00:35:42.767
in dealing with this
in the usual way.

00:35:42.767 --> 00:35:46.000
The usual way being the emperor
is petitioned by

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.067
people, he appoints some
arbiters or judges, the judges

00:35:50.067 --> 00:35:52.933
make a decision, and then the
emperor announces to these

00:35:52.933 --> 00:35:54.867
people that that's what
it's going to be.

00:35:54.867 --> 00:35:57.733
The problem is that, of course,
people like the

00:35:57.733 --> 00:36:00.133
Donatists were already
used to martyrdom.

00:36:00.133 --> 00:36:02.900
Threatening them with
imprisonment, threatening them

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:09.133
with torture, denouncing them,
trying to use the awesome,

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:12.267
awe-inspiring power of the
emperor against them was not

00:36:12.267 --> 00:36:13.500
going to be sufficient.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.967
Nevertheless, Constantine, far
from abandoning Christianity

00:36:19.967 --> 00:36:26.067
in frustration, becomes more and
more engaged in trying to,

00:36:26.067 --> 00:36:31.633
if not officially Christianize
the Empire, at least legislate

00:36:31.633 --> 00:36:34.300
as a Christian emperor.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:39.167
By 330, he has come to see
himself not merely as an

00:36:39.167 --> 00:36:43.633
emperor who has a kind of
peculiar favor or a peculiar

00:36:43.633 --> 00:36:48.833
god that is following him, but
as the implementer of the

00:36:48.833 --> 00:36:50.233
mission of the Church.

00:36:50.233 --> 00:36:54.267
So for example, he starts
promulgating laws against

00:36:54.267 --> 00:36:56.567
married men having
concubines--

00:36:56.567 --> 00:36:57.900
ineffective--

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:04.267
or the seduction of wards by
their guardians, or punishing

00:37:04.267 --> 00:37:08.833
rape by burning, all orientation
towards sexual

00:37:08.833 --> 00:37:14.167
crimes that shows a more
Christian horror of them than

00:37:14.167 --> 00:37:16.733
the more easygoing
Roman attitude.

00:37:20.333 --> 00:37:25.867
Constantine favors the church,
enacts legislation recommended

00:37:25.867 --> 00:37:33.500
by the church, favors the
bishops, and even in the 320s,

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:38.467
presides over the first
ecumenical council of bishops

00:37:38.467 --> 00:37:43.800
of the Church called at Nicaea
across the Bosporus from

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:49.533
Constantinople, the Ecumenical
Council of Nicaea called to

00:37:49.533 --> 00:37:52.167
deal with the Arian
controversy.

00:37:52.167 --> 00:37:58.000
And here, we see Constantine as
something different from an

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.667
emperor merely the companion of
Christ or the companion of

00:38:01.667 --> 00:38:05.033
God, but the emperor
as, in some

00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:07.533
sense, head of the Church.

00:38:07.533 --> 00:38:13.133
Constantine appears at the
council, he is deferred to by

00:38:13.133 --> 00:38:14.433
the bishops.

00:38:14.433 --> 00:38:19.200
Nevertheless, he is not
himself a bishop.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.400
He is not himself, however
imperial the Church may look,

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:28.567
able to legislate by himself
for the church.

00:38:28.567 --> 00:38:31.533
Because unlike many
other religions--

00:38:31.533 --> 00:38:33.067
and certainly when
we come to Islam,

00:38:33.067 --> 00:38:34.367
you'll see the contrast--

00:38:34.367 --> 00:38:38.567
the political leader of the
Roman Empire is not the

00:38:38.567 --> 00:38:42.200
designated leader of the
religious practice of the

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:48.433
Church because he is not a
priest. Now who is the

00:38:48.433 --> 00:38:51.367
designated leader of the church
is not clear yet.

00:38:51.367 --> 00:38:56.367
Certainly, it's not yet
the pope in the 320s.

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:59.167
It is the collectivity of
bishops, but in that case,

00:38:59.167 --> 00:39:02.933
then some bishops have more
power than others.

00:39:02.933 --> 00:39:06.800
Nevertheless, this is the
beginning of an era in which

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:15.967
we have a blending, but not a
total equivalency of secular

00:39:15.967 --> 00:39:20.200
rule, imperial rule, on the
one hand, and spiritual or

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.533
church rule on the other.

00:39:21.533 --> 00:39:24.133
And that's one of the things
that, of course, characterizes

00:39:24.133 --> 00:39:27.733
our image of the Middle Ages,
a period in which the church

00:39:27.733 --> 00:39:34.233
and the state were overlapping
if not actually fused.

00:39:34.233 --> 00:39:37.000
Constantine in relation to
Diocletian, to conclude.

00:39:39.567 --> 00:39:42.000
Differences and similarities.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.233
Obviously, their similarities
are great.

00:39:46.233 --> 00:39:51.167
Both Diocletian and Constantine
remade the Roman

00:39:51.167 --> 00:39:56.533
Empire as a much more tightly
administered state, a more

00:39:56.533 --> 00:39:59.233
bureaucratically complicated
state, and a

00:39:59.233 --> 00:40:02.433
more militarized state.

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:07.633
Constantine continued
Diocletian's military and

00:40:07.633 --> 00:40:09.233
administrative structure.

00:40:12.133 --> 00:40:15.433
Like Diocletian, in order to
do this, he had to rely on

00:40:15.433 --> 00:40:18.300
very heavy taxation.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.433
If anything, his taxation had
to be greater because he had

00:40:21.433 --> 00:40:25.100
exempted the Church and its
clergy, and someone was going

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.967
to have to make up
the difference.

00:40:30.233 --> 00:40:34.933
But Diocletian had persecuted
the Catholic church, whereas

00:40:34.933 --> 00:40:37.933
Constantine would favor it.

00:40:37.933 --> 00:40:41.733
And that is, of course,
a crucial difference.

00:40:41.733 --> 00:40:45.333
On the other hand, even here
there are some connections.

00:40:45.333 --> 00:40:47.667
Under Diocletian, the
emperor was a god.

00:40:47.667 --> 00:40:51.533
The emperor was a distantly
glimpsed figure.

00:40:51.533 --> 00:40:55.700
He was no longer, even in
pretense, first citizen, guy

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.033
just like you and me,
hand-shaker, baby-kisser,

00:40:59.033 --> 00:41:00.633
anything like that.

00:41:00.633 --> 00:41:04.500
But this was also true
with Constantine.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:11.933
Constantine, too, had a
ceremonial, distant, and--

00:41:11.933 --> 00:41:15.433
because of his association
with the Church--

00:41:15.433 --> 00:41:18.567
semi-sacred status.

00:41:18.567 --> 00:41:23.000
He couldn't be worshipped as a
god, to be sure, but he was

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.533
something a bit more than
merely a follower of

00:41:29.533 --> 00:41:30.767
Christianity.

00:41:32.667 --> 00:41:37.100
Constantine ended the Tetrarchy,
but he really set

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.233
the seal on the division of the
Empire east and west, as

00:41:40.233 --> 00:41:42.200
we've just said, by the
establishment of

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.633
Constantinople.

00:41:44.633 --> 00:41:46.900
And finally, Constantine was
a little more successful

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.733
economically.

00:41:48.733 --> 00:41:54.000
Diocletian did not have the
means available to Constantine

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.867
who had a certain amount from
the old pagan temple treasures

00:41:58.867 --> 00:42:01.567
that he was able
to confiscate.

00:42:01.567 --> 00:42:07.367
And also, by virtue of his
victory over Licinius, he was

00:42:07.367 --> 00:42:12.033
able to rule pretty tightly
over the Empire.

00:42:12.033 --> 00:42:18.767
The fourth century often is seen
as a period of decline

00:42:18.767 --> 00:42:21.533
because we're focused--

00:42:21.533 --> 00:42:24.733
we-- historians are focused on
the collapse of the Roman

00:42:24.733 --> 00:42:28.000
Empire in the late
fifth century.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.867
But obviously, people in 337,
the year that Constantine

00:42:30.867 --> 00:42:34.367
died, did not know that
in 476 the Western

00:42:34.367 --> 00:42:35.800
Empire would collapse.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.033
They did not know that in 410
Visigoths would invade and

00:42:39.033 --> 00:42:42.700
plunder the city of Rome, no
more than we have the faintest

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:47.167
idea of what's going to happen
75 or 100 years from now.

00:42:47.167 --> 00:42:50.733
From their point of view, the
Empire had been restored.

00:42:50.733 --> 00:42:53.400
The Empire, which had been
endangered in the third

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:58.767
century by invasions, inflation,
armed forces out of

00:42:58.767 --> 00:43:03.767
control, chaotic imperial
succession, was now stable.

00:43:03.767 --> 00:43:07.167
It was clear who the
emperor was.

00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:10.833
The barbarians had been pushed
back behind the frontiers.

00:43:10.833 --> 00:43:15.200
Trade, culture, civilization
seemingly flourished.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.233
And if we trust the impressions
we have of

00:43:18.233 --> 00:43:23.900
contemporaries, both formal,
written work and informal,

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.767
things like the slogans that
people put in their dining

00:43:28.767 --> 00:43:32.700
room mosaics, for example, good
times had been restored.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.100
This seems to be the
constant theme.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:40.033
And I emphasize this because,
again, it's a lesson in how

00:43:40.033 --> 00:43:44.133
history cannot be seen from
the front backwards.

00:43:44.133 --> 00:43:48.267
You can't use hindsight
to tell what

00:43:48.267 --> 00:43:50.833
people should have felt.

00:43:50.833 --> 00:43:53.267
People in the fourth century
at the time of Constantine

00:43:53.267 --> 00:43:54.533
were optimistic.

00:43:54.533 --> 00:43:58.133
No more so those people who had
embraced Christianity as

00:43:58.133 --> 00:44:02.700
the coming thing, as the
religion of not only truth,

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.600
but of success.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.033
What is odd is, of course, that
thus far, Christianity

00:44:08.033 --> 00:44:10.767
would have seemed
to be unlikely.

00:44:10.767 --> 00:44:14.233
Christianity would have seemed
to be alien from the Empire.

00:44:14.233 --> 00:44:18.133
And even if some emperor
embraced it for weird reasons

00:44:18.133 --> 00:44:21.733
of its own, his own, it wouldn't
have seemed to have

00:44:21.733 --> 00:44:27.000
been the most favorable context
for the preservation

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.800
of the Empire.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.800
And indeed, of course, the
Empire would fail in the west

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.567
within a century and a half
or so of the embrace of

00:44:34.567 --> 00:44:35.433
Christianity.

00:44:35.433 --> 00:44:39.533
And it's no surprise, then, that
the English historian of

00:44:39.533 --> 00:44:42.200
the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon,
whose Decline and Fall

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.600
of the Roman Empire sort of sets
the agenda for any course

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.633
like this one.

00:44:46.633 --> 00:44:49.800
It's no accident that Gibbon
blamed Christianity for the

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.733
fall of the Empire.

00:44:51.733 --> 00:44:54.000
But indeed, in the fourth
century, it seemed that

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.900
Christianity was one
of the forces that

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.667
had saved the Empire.

00:44:57.667 --> 00:45:01.667
And not only that, as we will
see as this course unfolds,

00:45:01.667 --> 00:45:06.233
much of what was preserved from
the debacle of 476 and

00:45:06.233 --> 00:45:10.800
successive problems of the
preservation of civilization

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.433
would be preserved through
the action of the Church.

00:45:15.433 --> 00:45:16.700
Thanks very much.

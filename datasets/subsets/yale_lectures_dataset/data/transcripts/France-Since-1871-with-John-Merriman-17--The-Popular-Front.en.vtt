00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.072
Professor John Merriman:
Okay, obviously France in

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:07.800
the 1920s and '30s has to be
seen in terms of the

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.960
international situation in
Europe,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.980
and particularly the rise of
fascism.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.488
It's easy to describe the 1920s
and 1930s as the Europe of

00:00:19.488 --> 00:00:25.770
extremes, and that is certainly
the case with the Soviet Union,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.820
but above all with the rise of
the extreme Right in Europe.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.476
By 1939 only in central and
eastern Europe,

00:00:35.476 --> 00:00:41.019
only Czechoslovakia,
which would soon be munched by

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.764
Germany,
had not--only Czechoslovakia

00:00:44.764 --> 00:00:48.993
remained a parliamentary regime.
And when you think of fascism,

00:00:48.993 --> 00:00:51.207
you obviously think of
Mussolini and you think of

00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:54.774
National Socialism in Germany,
but one must also remember that

00:00:54.774 --> 00:00:58.203
all of the other states in
central and eastern Europe

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:01.632
became authoritarian states and
parliamentary regimes

00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:05.392
disappeared one after another.
And then, of course--I'll

00:01:05.392 --> 00:01:09.052
mention this in awhile--but the
Spanish Civil War brought Franco

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:12.247
to power and we could debate
long into the night whether

00:01:12.247 --> 00:01:15.210
Franco was a fascist or just an
authoritarian,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.549
rightwing murderer.
But it was part of the general

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.840
scheme of things.
And even in countries in which

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.186
democracy survives,
such as Belgium,

00:01:28.186 --> 00:01:30.865
the Netherlands,
France, which we're going to

00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:32.822
talk about obviously,
and Great Britain,

00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:34.780
there were active fascist
movements;

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.661
although that in Britain,
led by Oswald Mosley,

00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:42.738
was quite small.
So, what I want to do today is

00:01:42.738 --> 00:01:48.110
discuss the rise of the Right in
France, and then talk about the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.505
Popular Front,
which some people still view

00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:55.050
today as sort of a magic moment
in French history,

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.617
and the efforts of Léon
Blum to create a new political

00:02:00.617 --> 00:02:05.635
world, and finally its failure.
And, so, for the political

00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:10.073
details of the national block
that came to power immediately

00:02:10.073 --> 00:02:13.909
after the war and the cartel
des gauches,

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:19.567
the cartel of the Left which
won the election in 1924,

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:23.409
I will leave that to your
reading.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.340
But one must remember that in
all of these countries,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.838
and in France among them,
the 1920s seemed to be--the

00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:39.169
temptation of the far Right was
certainly there.

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.771
Mussolini was on the cover of
Time Magazine eight

00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:45.354
different times in this country.
He became known as the man who

00:02:45.354 --> 00:02:49.435
got the Italian railroads to run
on time, even if they only ran

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:53.055
on time to the ski resorts to
which American journalists

00:02:53.055 --> 00:02:56.905
tended to go.
Hitler doesn't come to power

00:02:56.905 --> 00:03:00.042
until January 1933.
And, of course,

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:04.888
Hitler was the most successful
of a whole bunch of rightwing

00:03:04.888 --> 00:03:08.995
leaders in Germany,
all determined to overthrow the

00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:12.711
Weimar Republic.
So, to many people tempted,

00:03:12.711 --> 00:03:14.702
for example,
by corporatism,

00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:18.906
the idea that somehow you could
eliminate social strife by

00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:23.184
organizing industries in a
vertical way--Mussolini talked a

00:03:23.184 --> 00:03:26.809
good game about that,
and they actually made some

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:29.986
efforts--there was this
flirtation, this temptation with

00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:32.698
the extreme Right.
In the case of France,

00:03:32.698 --> 00:03:36.240
what happens in the 1920s and
1930s, and particularly

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.509
culminating on this day that
I'll talk about,

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:43.524
February 6th,
1934, you can see the origins

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:49.260
of that before World War One,
in Boulanger and in the case of

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.640
the anti-Dreyfusards.
So, fascism is a European

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.940
phenomenon and it became a
French phenomenon as well.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.828
The kind of official spokesman
who represented sort of the

00:04:02.828 --> 00:04:07.030
canon of fascist thought was
Drieu la Rochelle.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.417
There's an extremely good
biography of him,

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:13.920
or several of him.
He was a novelist whose work

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.688
was obsessed,
whose life was obsessed with

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:20.672
suicide, and he became the first
sort of spiritual leader of

00:04:20.672 --> 00:04:24.172
French fascists.
He wrote an autobiographical

00:04:24.172 --> 00:04:28.412
novel called Gilles,
in which he praised fascism as

00:04:28.412 --> 00:04:32.577
being capable of affecting a
spiritual revival of what he

00:04:32.577 --> 00:04:35.850
considered to be medieval
Christianity.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.083
And this would be a scene that
would be very important under

00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:42.589
Vichy, in the collaborationist
years of World War Two as well.

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:44.819
Charles Mauras,
whom you've read about,

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.280
who was the founder of Action
Française and who was a

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.272
monarchist,
he also gets into the act and

00:04:51.272 --> 00:04:55.350
he urges France to expand to
what he considered its truly

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.967
natural frontiers,
that is including the left bank

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:04.028
of the Rhine River.
Action Française is not

00:05:04.028 --> 00:05:07.958
really a mass movement the way
that some of the other ones

00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:11.061
would be--the
Croix-de-Feu--there were plebian

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:13.819
members of Action
Française,

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.836
it was more tied to monarchism
than it was to the quest for the

00:05:18.836 --> 00:05:22.639
kind of Mussolini or Hitler kind
of dictator,

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.230
but nonetheless it had
considerable influence.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.055
And in France the extreme Right
and Catholicism were closely

00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:35.717
linked, though obviously all
practicing Catholics were not

00:05:35.717 --> 00:05:39.480
members of the extreme rightwing
movement.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.881
But Mauras's sort of view was
that a monarchy would restore

00:05:43.881 --> 00:05:47.979
that kind of Christian medieval
virtue that was largely

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.850
imaginary and that all this
would come to pass,

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.796
hopefully in his lifetime.
And so they begin to create a

00:05:56.796 --> 00:06:00.830
paramilitary unit--that's
exactly what happens with the

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.639
Nazis and with the squadris
of Mussolini,

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.516
in the early 1920s,
that bring him to power in

00:06:08.516 --> 00:06:10.582
1922.
And, so, these soldiers,

00:06:10.582 --> 00:06:13.325
as in the case of the German
freikorps,

00:06:13.325 --> 00:06:15.519
continue basically just to
march.

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:18.391
And, so, the Action
Française takes the kind

00:06:18.391 --> 00:06:21.779
of tactics that were associated
in the early stages with the

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.833
Boulanger movement,
an argument I made earlier,

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:27.209
and carry them now into the
streets.

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:30.136
And with the growth of trade
union members,

00:06:30.136 --> 00:06:33.550
in France and in other
countries with this sort of

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.074
flocking of people to the CGT,
the Confédération

00:06:37.074 --> 00:06:38.751
Générale du
Travail, the General

00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:42.567
Confederation of Labor,
you had the growth of these

00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:47.839
rightwing groups who,
as the German counterparts,

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:52.170
wanted to end parliamentary
rule in France.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.704
This, by the way,
the Action Française is

00:06:54.704 --> 00:06:57.240
so over the top that it even
scares the Pope,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:04.360
and Action Française is
condemned by the Pope in 1926.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.508
And indeed, lots of members of
Action Française who were

00:07:07.508 --> 00:07:09.540
faithful Catholics leave the
movement,

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.980
fearing that they're going to
be excommunicated.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.617
And a number of other groups
who are even more radical start

00:07:18.617 --> 00:07:21.752
up.
There's one group called

00:07:21.752 --> 00:07:27.809
Faisceau, f-a-i-s-c-e-a-u,
which had begun in 1919 but

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:34.779
increases its membership and
believes in violent struggle,

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:38.447
this kind of action,
this kind of will to power that

00:07:38.447 --> 00:07:41.540
characterized national socialism
as well.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.983
Another, the Croix-de-Feu,
the Cross of Fire,

00:07:44.983 --> 00:07:48.964
attracted war veterans.
Not all of the war veterans

00:07:48.964 --> 00:07:52.940
ended up supporting the
radicals, or the socialists,

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.932
or the communists,
a good number of them go into

00:07:55.932 --> 00:07:58.924
rightwing groups,
and this is certainly the case

00:07:58.924 --> 00:08:03.157
with the Croix-de-Feu.
It was founded in 1928 as a

00:08:03.157 --> 00:08:08.791
nonpolitical organization and
its membership swells to about

00:08:08.791 --> 00:08:12.981
60,000 members.
Now, there has to be money

00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:17.259
behind these movements,
as well as ideology.

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:21.851
And it's kind of interesting
that some of the sort of big

00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:25.870
money people behind these
movements were in luxury

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.478
production.
Coty, for example,

00:08:28.478 --> 00:08:32.614
the perfume maker was a big
donor and believer in these

00:08:32.614 --> 00:08:36.289
far-rightwing causes and
anti-Semitic causes.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:40.190
So was Taittinger,
Taittinger the champagne

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.090
producer--obviously another
luxury good.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.565
I once took a bunch of Yale
alumni, we went to

00:08:46.565 --> 00:08:49.590
Épargne and to Reims
because they wanted to taste

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.799
champagne;
it was one of these Yale trips.

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:55.332
And they were a very nice
group, and we were being taken

00:08:55.332 --> 00:08:58.929
around the cave of Taittinger
and I couldn't stand it,

00:08:58.929 --> 00:09:01.240
they were telling us about what
a great patriot Taittinger was

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.399
and all this business,
and his portrait up there.

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:05.664
And I said, "well,
what happened during the

00:09:05.664 --> 00:09:07.991
1930s?"
I couldn't contain myself any

00:09:07.991 --> 00:09:11.230
more, what happened in the 1930s
in World War Two?

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.173
And the woman looked terribly
embarrassed and passed on to see

00:09:14.173 --> 00:09:17.019
if we would like to taste yet
another glass of champagne,

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:18.769
and the answer was a resounding
yes.

00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:22.033
But, so the money,
a lot of the money came from

00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:24.313
folks like that.
And then because the

00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:26.973
newspapers, as in the case of
Germany and most places,

00:09:26.973 --> 00:09:31.598
were controlled by the Right,
they have lots of ability to

00:09:31.598 --> 00:09:36.534
reach a large public.
Taittinger himself--the name,

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:40.513
the spelling is
t-a-i-t-t-i-n-g-e-r--he founds

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:44.049
the Patriotic Youth Movement in
1924,

00:09:44.049 --> 00:09:48.120
which has by the end of the
decade 100,000 members.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.129
So, these are not small groups.
Now, you have to--the

00:09:53.129 --> 00:09:57.074
attraction of particularly
middle-class people to the far

00:09:57.074 --> 00:10:01.019
Right is characteristic of
Germany and Italy as well.

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:05.197
And this too has to be seen in
the context of the hard times of

00:10:05.197 --> 00:10:09.634
the 1920s and the 1930s,
that Europe is basically in

00:10:09.634 --> 00:10:15.499
depression during the whole
time, except for 1924 to the big

00:10:15.499 --> 00:10:18.400
crash in 1929.
Eastern Europe is in

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.244
depression, agricultural
depression, very severe

00:10:21.244 --> 00:10:24.269
agricultural depression during
the entire time.

00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:28.129
And, so, with the kind of
rampant inflation--in France you

00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:31.852
didn't have anything similar,
nothing comparable to what

00:10:31.852 --> 00:10:34.831
happens in Germany.
Everybody's seen pictures of

00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:37.470
people pushing shopping carts
down the street full of

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.920
millions,
and millions,

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.411
and millions of deutschmarks,
and attempting to buy one

00:10:42.411 --> 00:10:45.301
single turnip.
But the people who get burned

00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:48.143
in inflation are
particularly--are middle-class

00:10:48.143 --> 00:10:51.974
people who are on pensions and
who have saved their whole lives

00:10:51.974 --> 00:10:54.558
for retirement,
and with inflation their

00:10:54.558 --> 00:10:57.029
savings are wiped out in one
single moment.

00:10:57.029 --> 00:10:59.934
In the case of Germany it's
quite clear because in the

00:10:59.934 --> 00:11:03.058
early, hyper-inflation of '22
and '23 you had these German

00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:06.182
bourgeois families who had to
sell silver that had been in

00:11:06.182 --> 00:11:10.170
their families for generations,
or had to sell antique armoires

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.269
that had been in their families
for generations,

00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:15.485
in order to have enough to eat,
and they hate,

00:11:15.485 --> 00:11:17.799
and they're going to blame
somebody for this.

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:20.354
And who they're going to blame
are the Weimar Republic and,

00:11:20.354 --> 00:11:22.688
in the case of France,
they're going to blame the very

00:11:22.688 --> 00:11:25.404
existence of the Republic.
And this lapses in,

00:11:25.404 --> 00:11:28.779
this elides into,
moves into various components

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:33.255
of fascist ideology that were
shared by all of these movements

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:36.241
everywhere,
is that they're virulently

00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:38.470
anti-socialist,
anti-communist.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.785
Hitler began by hating--before
he hated Jews he hated social

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:44.662
democrats.
They're anti-Bolshevik,

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:48.298
they're anti-socialist.
They're frightened by the

00:11:48.298 --> 00:11:51.029
revolution in Russia,
they're frightened by the fact

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:54.669
that these communist parties are
doing very well in these states.

00:11:54.669 --> 00:11:56.941
They're also virulently
anti-Semitic,

00:11:56.941 --> 00:11:59.213
and they're,
as I'll argue in awhile,

00:11:59.213 --> 00:12:01.837
xenophobic,
and they run those two together

00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:04.706
because there was a large
percentage of the people who

00:12:04.706 --> 00:12:08.346
have come into France,
particularly into Paris before

00:12:08.346 --> 00:12:12.919
World War One are Jews from
Eastern Europe and from Russia.

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:16.311
And in the 1930s,
of course, during the Spanish

00:12:16.311 --> 00:12:20.513
Civil War, you have a huge
immigration of Spanish refugees

00:12:20.513 --> 00:12:24.990
fleeing Franco's death squads,
and the civil war.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:29.149
And, so, they share those
characteristics as well.

00:12:29.149 --> 00:12:31.815
Moreover, the French
Right--I've already made it

00:12:31.815 --> 00:12:34.139
clear--they hate parliamentary
regimes.

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:37.541
The Europe of the 1920s and the
'30s was the Europe of

00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:41.767
dictators, and they wanted one.
And if Charles Mauras and the

00:12:41.767 --> 00:12:45.400
other Action Française
people wanted a king,

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.669
there weren't very many likely
candidates.

00:12:48.669 --> 00:12:51.647
It wasn't--there were
pretenders in both lines but it

00:12:51.647 --> 00:12:54.740
wasn't going to just happen
through some act of God,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:59.902
and they too could come to
believe that dictatorship was

00:12:59.902 --> 00:13:05.440
the only way of solving the
social and economic problems.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.529
And they're all virulently
nationalist;

00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:10.880
when you're talking about the
annexation of the left bank of

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.059
the Rhine or when Hitler's
talking about elbow's room,

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:16.925
lebensraum,
elbow room, expansion room,

00:13:16.925 --> 00:13:20.300
for the German population,
it is part of this theme of

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.612
aggressive nationalism,
and that also ties into the

00:13:24.612 --> 00:13:29.990
kind of xenophobia that is
behind this entire movement.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.807
And, so, xenophobia emerges as
a characteristic of the far

00:13:34.807 --> 00:13:37.090
Right in France,
as well.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.193
Now, because the French
population had stopped

00:13:41.193 --> 00:13:47.029
growing--constant theme--it only
grows by 72,000 between 1931 and

00:13:47.029 --> 00:13:49.517
1936;
and, as I said before,

00:13:49.517 --> 00:13:53.003
two-thirds of the
départements in

00:13:53.003 --> 00:13:57.929
France had a smaller population
in 1939 than they did in 1851.

00:13:57.929 --> 00:14:01.491
France has relatively few
people under the age,

00:14:01.491 --> 00:14:05.886
under twenty years of age;
only about thirty-one percent,

00:14:05.886 --> 00:14:10.116
which is an extremely low
percentage compared to countries

00:14:10.116 --> 00:14:14.049
that have really a high rate of
population growth,

00:14:14.049 --> 00:14:18.820
and relatively more people who
were elderly.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.875
And beginning in 1935,
more people die each year in

00:14:22.875 --> 00:14:27.580
France, and not just in big
cities, than are born there.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:32.620
So, who makes up the difference?
Well, Italians,

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:39.909
720,000 in France in 1936;
Poles, 425,000;

00:14:39.909 --> 00:14:44.271
Spaniards, 255,000,
and there'll be lots more by

00:14:44.271 --> 00:14:50.830
1939, for obvious reasons;
and Belgians, 195,000.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:55.731
But also Jews,
the Jewish population of France

00:14:55.731 --> 00:15:00.633
is about 320,000,
and half of them had come to

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:05.411
France since 1918.
So, this immigration of very

00:15:05.411 --> 00:15:10.259
poor Jews from Poland and from
Eastern Europe continues.

00:15:10.259 --> 00:15:14.109
And, so, 7.5 percent of the
French population in the late

00:15:14.109 --> 00:15:17.890
'30s consists of immigrants--it
was the highest populate

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.639
percentage of any country in
Europe.

00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:25.868
Now, if you want to also argue
why, with the exception of

00:15:25.868 --> 00:15:30.722
Oswald Mosley strutting around
Hyde Park in his black

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:34.528
military-like uniform,
Britain doesn't have much

00:15:34.528 --> 00:15:37.562
appeal to the far Right,
and one of the reasons was that

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:42.011
immigration,
which is always this sort of

00:15:42.011 --> 00:15:50.159
lightening rod for xenophobia,
was relatively small in London,

00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:52.744
in England, compared to these
other places,

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:56.374
despite the fact that it was
only in London and not in Paris

00:15:56.374 --> 00:15:58.476
where,
as early as the eighteenth

00:15:58.476 --> 00:16:01.735
century and even before that,
you would run into people of

00:16:01.735 --> 00:16:05.490
color,
because of the British empire;

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:10.973
so, xenophobia is seized upon
by these parties as an issue to

00:16:10.973 --> 00:16:13.441
rally support,
in elections,

00:16:13.441 --> 00:16:18.736
but also on the streets.
And if you think that's not the

00:16:18.736 --> 00:16:24.296
case now, look at the success of
the National Front in the 1980s

00:16:24.296 --> 00:16:29.856
and 1990s in France and the kind
of violent discourse of the far

00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:34.820
Right in France today,
something to which we will come

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.064
back to.
Now, also let me just say and

00:16:37.064 --> 00:16:39.950
let me just add that it's
not--the parties of the Left,

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:46.172
too, are not exempt from
xenophobia, but not anywhere to

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:52.961
the same extent that the parties
of the far Right built their

00:16:52.961 --> 00:16:57.184
base upon xenophobia.
I have a former dissertation

00:16:57.184 --> 00:17:00.323
student who now teaches at Penn
State who has a wonderful thesis

00:17:00.323 --> 00:17:03.544
on the police,
the way they tracked immigrants

00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:07.910
who were supporters of the
Communist Party in Paris in the

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.593
1930s,
particularly people from West

00:17:11.593 --> 00:17:16.451
Africa and from Guadalupe.
And, so, the flirtation of some

00:17:16.451 --> 00:17:19.859
immigrants to Paris,
particularly people of color,

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:24.132
with the far Left,
intensifies the hatred by the

00:17:24.132 --> 00:17:27.859
parties of the far Right of
immigrants.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:31.758
And their idea of what they
called "true France," that is

00:17:31.758 --> 00:17:35.723
this true, Catholic,
medieval France rooted in the

00:17:35.723 --> 00:17:39.248
soil did not include,
in their fantasies of

00:17:39.248 --> 00:17:43.900
aggressive nationalism,
did not include immigrants.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:50.349
This is, it's an obvious theme
from the 1920s and 1930s;

00:17:50.349 --> 00:17:55.448
though Hitler with his own not
uniquely but over the top,

00:17:55.448 --> 00:18:01.003
pernicious, biological view of
race was the one who took it to

00:18:01.003 --> 00:18:03.535
its extreme,
saying that he,

00:18:03.535 --> 00:18:06.907
the Fuhrer,
the leader, the equivalent of

00:18:06.907 --> 00:18:10.127
the Duce,
that's what they called them in

00:18:10.127 --> 00:18:13.782
Italy, or the Cadillo in
Spain, he would have the right

00:18:13.782 --> 00:18:17.311
to say who lives and who dies,
who is part of the German

00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:20.289
volk, the German people,
and who is not.

00:18:20.289 --> 00:18:22.406
And, of course,
Hitler runs into some

00:18:22.406 --> 00:18:25.580
difficulty, very minor,
with German populations because

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:29.165
he begins to use euthanasia as a
tool of the state and to kill

00:18:29.165 --> 00:18:32.339
people who are handicapped or
mentally retarded,

00:18:32.339 --> 00:18:35.279
as well as Jews,
and gypsies,

00:18:35.279 --> 00:18:40.065
and gays, right along the way.
And then a lot of Germans say,

00:18:40.065 --> 00:18:42.156
"wait a minute,
but these poor people who are

00:18:42.156 --> 00:18:44.959
mentally retarded that you're
killing or that you're letting

00:18:44.959 --> 00:18:47.500
your doctors experiment on,
they're real Germans.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.236
Do what you want with the
others, do what you want with

00:18:51.236 --> 00:18:54.903
the immigrant Jews or the Jews
who were born there and

00:18:54.903 --> 00:18:57.822
assimilated,
but leave the real Germans

00:18:57.822 --> 00:19:00.877
alone."
So, this is an awful kind of

00:19:00.877 --> 00:19:06.319
discourse even to consider but
it is really part of this great

00:19:06.319 --> 00:19:08.520
movement,
this groundswell,

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.577
in France as well as in other
countries, against parliamentary

00:19:12.577 --> 00:19:15.076
rule.
Now, this culminates--this is

00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:18.670
making a very long story
short--but this culminates,

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:24.333
of course, February 6th,
1934, in the Front Populaire,

00:19:24.333 --> 00:19:29.386
the Popular Front.
A political scandal gives the

00:19:29.386 --> 00:19:33.509
extreme Right an opportunity for
action.

00:19:33.509 --> 00:19:37.495
Now, this is a country that had
all these political scandals

00:19:37.495 --> 00:19:41.307
before, that they'd survived;
and not just the Dreyfus Affair

00:19:41.307 --> 00:19:44.631
but the Wilson Affair and all of
this business that we talked

00:19:44.631 --> 00:19:46.964
about;
and the Panama Canal scandal

00:19:46.964 --> 00:19:50.829
that we talked about before that
discredited the Republic.

00:19:50.829 --> 00:19:56.930
And, so, now the Republic is
accused of not only being soft,

00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:01.170
not virile, full of sort of
quarreling,

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:06.150
rotating ministries,
a weak system without a strong

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:11.130
executive authority,
but again of being corrupt.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:15.315
And Drieu la Rochelle boasted,
he says the France of camping

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:19.714
out, that is getting up in the
morning and plunging into frozen

00:20:19.714 --> 00:20:23.828
ponds in the Auvergne and being
a boy-scout and all of this

00:20:23.828 --> 00:20:26.651
stuff,
will conquer the France of the

00:20:26.651 --> 00:20:29.083
apero,
that is the drink after,

00:20:29.083 --> 00:20:32.022
drink before meals.
And the Rightists shouted,

00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:35.353
"down with the France of the
aperitif!"--what an idea--down

00:20:35.353 --> 00:20:37.880
with the France of the
before-meal drink.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.924
And, as a matter of fact,
during 1934,

00:20:39.924 --> 00:20:43.019
during the heyday there were
signs posted in cafés

00:20:43.019 --> 00:20:45.339
around the Chambre des
Deputés,

00:20:45.339 --> 00:20:47.921
around the Palais Bourbon,
that said no deputies served

00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:50.455
here, we just want--we want
people who are against the

00:20:50.455 --> 00:20:52.319
Republic to come in and drink
here,

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:54.730
we don't want people who
represent the Republic.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:59.314
And the police make it very
difficult to--they look the

00:20:59.314 --> 00:21:04.152
other way as these sort of
rightwing groups mobilize their

00:21:04.152 --> 00:21:08.190
forces in the streets.
And again, I said this before

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.588
but it's true,
if you look at the whole

00:21:10.588 --> 00:21:12.366
period,
1914 to 1944 or '45,

00:21:12.366 --> 00:21:15.979
it's a thirty years war because
basically Europe is still at war

00:21:15.979 --> 00:21:18.673
and it's a war waged on
different levels--on the

00:21:18.673 --> 00:21:22.124
intellectual level,
the newspaper violent headlines

00:21:22.124 --> 00:21:24.400
level, and battles in the
street.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.710
And these people are playing
for keeps.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.412
A very shady character called
Serge Stavisky,

00:21:30.412 --> 00:21:34.029
played by Jean-Paul Belmondo in
the film,

00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:38.066
was a Ukrainian Jew who had
come to France with his family

00:21:38.066 --> 00:21:41.427
as a small boy.
He made his living basically by

00:21:41.427 --> 00:21:44.460
cheating people.
He was a con guy.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.601
His father committed suicide
out of shame for the way that

00:21:48.601 --> 00:21:52.696
his son made his income.
One of his cleverest projects,

00:21:52.696 --> 00:21:55.932
but most ill fated,
was involving the sale of

00:21:55.932 --> 00:21:59.609
municipal bonds in that Basque
town of Bayonne,

00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:05.111
down near the Spanish border in
the Pyrén&amp;eac

00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:09.750
ute;es-Atlantique,
in the Basque country,

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:13.793
in southwestern France.
There was a dummy company that

00:22:13.793 --> 00:22:18.022
had been created to cover up the
operation and lots of reputable

00:22:18.022 --> 00:22:22.049
insurance companies had invested
and lost a lot of money.

00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:24.882
Stavisky had a lot of money,
because of this,

00:22:24.882 --> 00:22:28.188
and he loved the good life.
He loved fast cars,

00:22:28.188 --> 00:22:32.428
he loved fancy women and he
loved spending other people's

00:22:32.428 --> 00:22:34.934
money.
He loved great restaurants,

00:22:34.934 --> 00:22:38.650
having thirty-six roses
delivered to his chosen lover of

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.150
the evening, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:46.277
But gradually it all collapses
on his head and in December 1933

00:22:46.277 --> 00:22:49.235
he flees to the Alps,
near Chamonix,

00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:53.685
and he rents a villa--he didn't
just flee to a small room in

00:22:53.685 --> 00:22:56.400
Lavancher or someplace like
that;

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:01.048
you had to have a villa and let
people know that you're still

00:23:01.048 --> 00:23:04.225
living very well--and
revelations pile up,

00:23:04.225 --> 00:23:07.523
one after another.
A minister of the government

00:23:07.523 --> 00:23:10.880
had written an enthusiastic
letter recommending the bonds,

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:16.039
but Stavisky had been protected
by an obliging State prosecutor

00:23:16.039 --> 00:23:20.118
who happened to be the
brother-in-law of the Prime

00:23:20.118 --> 00:23:23.006
Minister,
a forgettable character called

00:23:23.006 --> 00:23:25.058
Camille Chautemps.
And, so, Action

00:23:25.058 --> 00:23:28.873
Française's newspaper has
a big headline on the^( )7th of

00:23:28.873 --> 00:23:32.216
January,
1934, "Down With the Thieves,"

00:23:32.216 --> 00:23:37.480
or urging a large protest
against the Chamber of Deputies.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.269
The police are on Stavisky's
trail.

00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:45.218
They arrive in Chamonix,
they find out what man carrying

00:23:45.218 --> 00:23:49.525
lots of flowers and dressed in
white has rented a villa up in

00:23:49.525 --> 00:23:52.909
the hills.
And they get--as they're moving

00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:57.130
into arrest him at this villa he
blows his brains out.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.875
And this bursts into a
full-fledged political crisis

00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:04.400
that came close to bringing down
the Republic.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.039
Now, the police didn't bother
to call a doctor until they were

00:24:08.039 --> 00:24:11.882
sure that Stavisky was dead;
and this raises all sorts of

00:24:11.882 --> 00:24:15.987
concern because of the obvious
issue that he might reveal

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:19.579
highly-placed people with whom
he was working.

00:24:19.579 --> 00:24:23.429
He left a suicide note,
to his son, signed Your Unhappy

00:24:23.429 --> 00:24:27.706
Daddy--and it might have been
forged, there was something not

00:24:27.706 --> 00:24:32.230
quite right about the writing.
That Stavisky was a Jew caused

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:36.569
all of the--and he might've been
something else but he happened

00:24:36.569 --> 00:24:40.210
to be a Jew--caused the
rightwing organizations to go

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.908
wild,
and the demonstrations became

00:24:42.908 --> 00:24:47.112
nothing less than an attack on
the Republic and demonstrations

00:24:47.112 --> 00:24:50.355
turned into riots,
particularly after another

00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:53.049
minister is implicated in the
scandal;

00:24:53.049 --> 00:24:57.859
and Chautemps bags it on the
27th of January.

00:24:57.859 --> 00:25:01.992
And there's another coalition
government, yet another one

00:25:01.992 --> 00:25:04.869
that's caused to come into
existence.

00:25:04.869 --> 00:25:07.610
Shakespeare's play
Coriolanus,

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.569
a play that has strong
authoritarian implications,

00:25:11.569 --> 00:25:14.628
was wildly applauded at the
Comédie Française

00:25:14.628 --> 00:25:17.950
and the young patriots vow to
sweep away the Socialist Party,

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.880
the Communist Party,
and dirty Jewish finance.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:27.440
The Prefect of Police is a guy
called Jean Chiappe,

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.937
c-h-i-a-p-p-e.
He appeared quite unconcerned

00:25:30.937 --> 00:25:34.371
with the rightwing riots in the
streets, but he ordered the

00:25:34.371 --> 00:25:37.450
bashing of any leftwing heads
that could be seen.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:40.599
When the new head of the
government, Daladier,

00:25:40.599 --> 00:25:44.309
whom you can read about,
called Chiappe telling him of

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:48.230
his dismissal the policeman
refused to be sent to Morocco

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.730
and promised that he would be in
the street,

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.549
suggesting to Daladier not a
fear of unemployment,

00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:58.289
that he was going to be in the
street because he is unemployed,

00:25:58.289 --> 00:26:01.430
but a promise to lead the
overthrow of the Republic.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:05.914
And on February 4th,
1934, every rightwing group

00:26:05.914 --> 00:26:10.400
plans to meet before the Chamber
of Deputies.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.116
They march down the
Champs-Elysées or come

00:26:12.116 --> 00:26:14.523
from another direction.
My favorite group in this is

00:26:14.523 --> 00:26:17.549
one small group of people are
marching down the street,

00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:19.848
down, and they're all ready to
go and join the others,

00:26:19.848 --> 00:26:22.319
and they look at--somebody
looks at his watch and says,

00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:23.864
"well, it's 7:30,
il faut manger quand

00:26:23.864 --> 00:26:25.460
même."
And so they leave,

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.809
they say it's time to eat,
and so they leave the

00:26:27.809 --> 00:26:30.457
demonstration to go eat,
and then they miss the whole

00:26:30.457 --> 00:26:32.867
thing because they're having
some sort of lavish meal

00:26:32.867 --> 00:26:34.346
someplace.
I wouldn't have been in a

00:26:34.346 --> 00:26:36.274
rightwing demonstration,
but I would have left to go eat

00:26:36.274 --> 00:26:38.955
as well.
And, so, what happens is they

00:26:38.955 --> 00:26:43.070
go charging across the Seine
River, they're trying to

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.920
literally overthrow the
Republic.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.504
There are debates whether it
was just a--it was a real coup

00:26:48.504 --> 00:26:50.064
d'état attempt,
an overthrow,

00:26:50.064 --> 00:26:53.809
or whether just demonstrating.
The police batter them back.

00:26:53.809 --> 00:26:56.761
I have an uncle who was a
communist who was doing his

00:26:56.761 --> 00:26:59.599
psychoanalytic training in
Berlin in those days,

00:26:59.599 --> 00:27:02.189
and was a very active
communist, and he claims to have

00:27:02.189 --> 00:27:05.072
been in a counter-demonstration
and to have been grazed by a

00:27:05.072 --> 00:27:07.221
bullet because the communists
were there as a

00:27:07.221 --> 00:27:09.747
counter-demonstration;
and I don't know,

00:27:09.747 --> 00:27:13.559
his stories became more and
more lavish over the years.

00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:16.539
But he was a wonderful man,
and he probably was there.

00:27:16.539 --> 00:27:20.048
So, there were fourteen
demonstrators killed and several

00:27:20.048 --> 00:27:23.394
thousand injured.
So, this is a very big event,

00:27:23.394 --> 00:27:26.779
and several hundred policemen
also were hurt.

00:27:26.779 --> 00:27:29.799
Daladier resigns on February
8th.

00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:33.206
But the big significance of
this event was that this is a

00:27:33.206 --> 00:27:35.700
real attempt to overthrow the
Republic.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:40.668
And on February 12th the
largest demonstrations in French

00:27:40.668 --> 00:27:44.515
history, until 1968,
occurred in every single

00:27:44.515 --> 00:27:48.070
prefecture in France,
outside of two or three,

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:51.645
in defense of the Republic.
And the Popular Front,

00:27:51.645 --> 00:27:54.659
that alliance between the
radicals--whom you'll remember

00:27:54.659 --> 00:27:57.289
are socially moderate but very
anti-clerical,

00:27:57.289 --> 00:28:00.159
but they had lost their raison
d'être a little bit--the

00:28:00.159 --> 00:28:03.759
socialists and the communists.
This alliance to save the

00:28:03.759 --> 00:28:09.055
Republic against fascism emerges
out of this fait accompli

00:28:09.055 --> 00:28:13.772
of these popular demonstrations
of people pouring into the

00:28:13.772 --> 00:28:18.821
street--millions of French men
and women and children march in

00:28:18.821 --> 00:28:21.118
France.
It's followed by a

00:28:21.118 --> 00:28:24.914
twenty-four-hour strike.
The Stavisky Affair was kept

00:28:24.914 --> 00:28:29.265
alive by the discovery of the
mangled body of the public

00:28:29.265 --> 00:28:34.011
prosecutor of the Paris Court
which had been tied down on the

00:28:34.011 --> 00:28:38.915
railroad tracks so that he was
caught by the 5:12 train between

00:28:38.915 --> 00:28:45.086
Paris and Dijon and cut in half.
The Republic seemed to have a

00:28:45.086 --> 00:28:50.301
new lease on life but,
as one of its critics said,

00:28:50.301 --> 00:28:55.410
it could also be called a new
lease on death.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:00.451
But something had been changed
because the three major parties

00:29:00.451 --> 00:29:04.456
had been frightened.
Now, in 1920 you will know,

00:29:04.456 --> 00:29:08.262
you will remember,
that at the Congress of Tours

00:29:08.262 --> 00:29:13.039
the Communist Party split away
from the Socialist Party.

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:16.667
And the Communist Party
retained some elements of that

00:29:16.667 --> 00:29:20.089
old Guesdist Party,
that you remember me discussing

00:29:20.089 --> 00:29:24.195
before World War One--I wasn't
discussing it before World War

00:29:24.195 --> 00:29:26.956
One,
but we discussed it before we

00:29:26.956 --> 00:29:30.824
got to World War One--in that it
was sort of a top-down

00:29:30.824 --> 00:29:33.700
organization.
The democratic centralism,

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.229
decisions made at the top and
then informing the party

00:29:37.229 --> 00:29:41.490
faithful of what they would be
was an essential part of that.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:44.229
In 1921, '22 and '23,
mostly '22, '23,

00:29:44.229 --> 00:29:48.006
if I remember correctly,
the Communist intellectuals

00:29:48.006 --> 00:29:52.557
were thrown out of the party.
The Communist Party quite

00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:56.940
slavishly obeyed every order
that came from Moscow.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:01.695
Its leaders were miners like
Torrez or industrial workers,

00:30:01.695 --> 00:30:06.200
but because they provided very
good social services,

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.492
particularly in the Red Belt,
those suburbs around Paris,

00:30:11.492 --> 00:30:16.500
had the prestige that long
predated the heroic role of

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.470
communist resistance in World
War Two.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:25.879
But they considered Léon
Blum and the Socialist Party to

00:30:25.879 --> 00:30:29.791
be anathema--for one thing,
Blum was a bourgeois

00:30:29.791 --> 00:30:34.075
himself--and the Socialist Party
was willing to compromise with

00:30:34.075 --> 00:30:37.109
other parties,
was a reformist party in the

00:30:37.109 --> 00:30:40.350
tradition of Jean Jaurès.
Léon Blum,

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.575
who was born on the Rue
Saint-Dennis,

00:30:42.575 --> 00:30:45.417
in Paris--there's still a
plaque there-- was an

00:30:45.417 --> 00:30:48.982
intellectual.
He was a literary critic,

00:30:48.982 --> 00:30:52.039
he was a writer.
He had written a pamphlet

00:30:52.039 --> 00:30:55.264
called "On Marriage" which was
considered scandalous before

00:30:55.264 --> 00:30:58.488
World War One in which he said
it was okay not to marry but

00:30:58.488 --> 00:31:00.990
simply be with somebody and all
of that,

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:03.280
for a long period of time;
it was a recognition of the

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.059
fact that in many places people
weren't married,

00:31:05.059 --> 00:31:07.862
simply lived together,
and particularly in large

00:31:07.862 --> 00:31:09.950
cities and particularly in
Paris.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:13.239
And when Jaurès was
killed on the 31st of July,

00:31:13.239 --> 00:31:16.342
1914, Léon Blum was the
logical successor of

00:31:16.342 --> 00:31:19.585
Jaurès.
He had an ability to bring

00:31:19.585 --> 00:31:24.407
people in a room and to get them
unified, and he becomes the

00:31:24.407 --> 00:31:27.839
dominant figure in the Socialist
Party.

00:31:27.839 --> 00:31:30.448
But Léon Blum,
there was something else about

00:31:30.448 --> 00:31:33.824
him that mattered as well,
in the Popular Front in France

00:31:33.824 --> 00:31:37.390
before that, is that Léon
Blum was also Jewish.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:42.647
And one thing that you heard
from 1934,1935,

00:31:42.647 --> 00:31:48.545
1936 is well-dressed students,
probably from the fac

00:31:48.545 --> 00:31:51.937
d'Assas, in Paris,
rightwing students,

00:31:51.937 --> 00:31:54.480
shouting,
"better Hitler than Blum."

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.984
And at one point Léon
Blum was pulled out of his car,

00:31:56.984 --> 00:31:59.427
on the Rue des Écoles,
near the Sorbonne,

00:31:59.427 --> 00:32:02.369
and almost beaten to death by
rightwing thugs.

00:32:02.369 --> 00:32:07.410
Léon Blum was Jewish,
and he was an intellectual.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:11.337
So, the Communist Party--in a
way it was the case of the tail

00:32:11.337 --> 00:32:15.133
wagging the dog because it was
the Communist militants that

00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:18.930
really demanded that there be a
block against Fascism;

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:24.792
but the Communist Party finds
itself allied the Socialist

00:32:24.792 --> 00:32:27.089
Party.
And these are not small numbers.

00:32:27.089 --> 00:32:30.087
The number of people in the
Communist Party,

00:32:30.087 --> 00:32:34.269
by 1936 there were 330,000
members of the Communist Party.

00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:36.991
And, again, they're
particularly powerful in the Red

00:32:36.991 --> 00:32:39.819
Belt around Paris but big
influence in places like the

00:32:39.819 --> 00:32:44.085
Allier and the Nièvre,
in the Bourbonnais essentially,

00:32:44.085 --> 00:32:48.369
in the industrial regions of
the north they do very,

00:32:48.369 --> 00:32:51.877
very well--places where the
Guesdists had done well in the

00:32:51.877 --> 00:32:54.859
nineteenth century.
So, they do really well among

00:32:54.859 --> 00:32:58.180
industrial workers and above all
among railroad workers.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.723
And that's still the case today.
The cheminaux,

00:33:00.723 --> 00:33:03.582
the railroad engineers and the
railroad workers still--the

00:33:03.582 --> 00:33:05.740
Communist Party has lost most
influence,

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.898
but the influence of the party
in the General Confederation of

00:33:08.898 --> 00:33:11.850
Labor is still seen whenever
there's a big train strike in

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.438
France,
and you're stuck in the station

00:33:14.438 --> 00:33:17.890
for hours and hours because the
train is not coming.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:23.583
And, so, in the meantime
government after government

00:33:23.583 --> 00:33:26.865
follows.
And, so, in June 1934 the

00:33:26.865 --> 00:33:32.150
Communist Party repudiates what
they called class versus class

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.811
strategy,
that is making possible--the

00:33:34.811 --> 00:33:38.168
alliance now was the bourgeois
party, that is the Socialist

00:33:38.168 --> 00:33:40.194
Party;
lots of workers supported the

00:33:40.194 --> 00:33:42.373
socialist parties,
but the Communist Party,

00:33:42.373 --> 00:33:45.173
it was the Socialist Party,
was inevitably the bourgeois

00:33:45.173 --> 00:33:48.606
party, that was their discourse.
And the three parties meet and

00:33:48.606 --> 00:33:52.539
prepare a compromised program
that incorporated tax reform,

00:33:52.539 --> 00:33:55.826
a shorter work week,
increased unemployment

00:33:55.826 --> 00:33:58.799
benefits, international
disarmament,

00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:02.792
support for the League of
Nations and the dissolution of

00:34:02.792 --> 00:34:06.857
the fascist leagues--you can get
this out of the book but

00:34:06.857 --> 00:34:10.213
basically that's it.
So, on the 7th of March,

00:34:10.213 --> 00:34:13.172
1936, German armies moved into
the Rhineland,

00:34:13.172 --> 00:34:17.005
and now the threat to the
Republic inside France seemed to

00:34:17.005 --> 00:34:20.837
have been marked by Hitler's
winning the big bluff against

00:34:20.837 --> 00:34:24.603
the League of Nations and
against the Allied powers after

00:34:24.603 --> 00:34:26.992
World War One.
And, in fact,

00:34:26.992 --> 00:34:30.945
Hitler's generals said "mein
Fuhrer, I wouldn't do this

00:34:30.945 --> 00:34:33.829
because army is weak now;
we're re-building."

00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:37.998
They were already--their pilots
are being trained by Soviet

00:34:37.998 --> 00:34:40.082
pilots already,
way before the

00:34:40.082 --> 00:34:44.073
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939.
They said, "mein Fuhrer,

00:34:44.073 --> 00:34:46.653
I wouldn't do this because the
Belgian Army and the French

00:34:46.653 --> 00:34:49.369
Army"--it's hard to imagine the
Belgian Army very strong,

00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:51.690
but the German Army,
remember, had been demobilized

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:54.547
essentially.
And Hitler says we're going to

00:34:54.547 --> 00:34:57.489
do it anyway,
and he gets away with it.

00:34:57.489 --> 00:35:02.130
So, what this does is it leads
to, in the elections of May of

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:06.694
1936, a victory of the Popular
Front--fifty-seven percent of

00:35:06.694 --> 00:35:10.121
the vote,
with the Socialist Party now

00:35:10.121 --> 00:35:16.017
the largest party in France.
And they have 386 of 608 seats

00:35:16.017 --> 00:35:20.778
in the Chamber of Deputies.
Now, the Communists refused to

00:35:20.778 --> 00:35:23.708
participate in the cabinet
because they don't want to be

00:35:23.708 --> 00:35:27.514
associated with any failure,
but yet their adding to this

00:35:27.514 --> 00:35:30.900
mix of three has made the
victory possible.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:36.288
And, so, Léon Blum
becomes prime minister on the

00:35:36.288 --> 00:35:40.679
3rd of June, 1936,
under threats all the time

00:35:40.679 --> 00:35:44.869
because of the fact that he was
a Jew.

00:35:44.869 --> 00:35:49.226
Now, what happens next is that
the largest wave of strikes in

00:35:49.226 --> 00:35:51.550
France until,
that year again,

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:54.556
1968, breaks out,
because workers,

00:35:54.556 --> 00:35:59.476
encouraged by the Popular
Front's pre-election promises

00:35:59.476 --> 00:36:04.271
now go on strike.
In June 1936 there are 12,000

00:36:04.271 --> 00:36:10.035
strikes involving 2,000,000
workers, more strikers than any

00:36:10.035 --> 00:36:12.082
time.
And for the first time

00:36:12.082 --> 00:36:15.668
ever--now, this happens also in
Flint and in Detroit at the same

00:36:15.668 --> 00:36:18.286
time--workers occupied
factories, they occupied

00:36:18.286 --> 00:36:20.719
factories.
They put on guerrilla theater.

00:36:20.719 --> 00:36:23.716
They do performances in which
they play--some guy plays the

00:36:23.716 --> 00:36:26.930
bad guy, the boss,
or the contremaitre,

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:29.271
the foreman,
or the pinkerton,

00:36:29.271 --> 00:36:32.849
et cetera, et cetera.
So, they're occupying these

00:36:32.849 --> 00:36:36.248
factories in places like Nantes
and Boulogne-Billancourt,

00:36:36.248 --> 00:36:38.920
the big Renault factory outside
of Paris.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:46.887
And, so, there are pre-existing
grievances--conditions of work,

00:36:46.887 --> 00:36:49.419
Taylorism.
A worker remembered,

00:36:49.419 --> 00:36:52.485
"there are two factors in this
slavery that we face-- speed and

00:36:52.485 --> 00:36:54.675
orders.
One must, while putting myself

00:36:54.675 --> 00:36:57.671
in front of the machine,
kill one's soul eight hours a

00:36:57.671 --> 00:36:59.649
day, one's thoughts,
one's feelings,

00:36:59.649 --> 00:37:02.115
everything."
Workers in France still refer

00:37:02.115 --> 00:37:03.880
to the factory as a
bagne;

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:07.557
a bagne is a prison,
b-a-g-n-e-- again the idea that

00:37:07.557 --> 00:37:10.409
you're a prisoner there while
you're there,

00:37:10.409 --> 00:37:13.310
and you're under the direct
orders of the foreman or the

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:14.840
boss, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.677
And what is interesting is that
the strikes take the labor

00:37:19.677 --> 00:37:23.920
federations and the Communist
Party by surprise.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.962
The Communist leaders say wait
a minute, what are you doing,

00:37:26.962 --> 00:37:29.539
what are you doing,
is the tail wagging the dog?

00:37:29.539 --> 00:37:32.565
And they say,
memorably, "everything is not

00:37:32.565 --> 00:37:34.745
possible."
And the workers reply,

00:37:34.745 --> 00:37:38.205
"everything is possible."
And they don't want to lose the

00:37:38.205 --> 00:37:41.062
influence of the party.
And this isn't the last time

00:37:41.062 --> 00:37:43.235
this would happen because it
happens in 1968,

00:37:43.235 --> 00:37:44.530
also.
The Communist Party said,

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.916
"why are you people striking?
We didn't give you orders to go

00:37:46.916 --> 00:37:48.960
on strike.
What do you think you're doing?"

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.818
What they thought they were
doing was representing their own

00:37:51.818 --> 00:37:52.884
interests.
And, so,

00:37:52.884 --> 00:37:55.851
L'Humanité,
the Communist newspaper,

00:37:55.851 --> 00:37:57.971
has a huge title,
gros titre,

00:37:57.971 --> 00:38:02.420
"Everything is Not Possible."
But now should Léon Blum

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:07.125
have called on the workers and
the peasants to initiate a more

00:38:07.125 --> 00:38:12.320
radical form of Popular Front?
Well, probably not.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.041
But what he does is he calls
the government and the

00:38:15.041 --> 00:38:18.090
employers, they're all going to
get together and meet,

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.488
and they form the--they do what
are called the Matignon

00:38:20.488 --> 00:38:23.019
Agreements--I'm sorry I didn't
write this on the board,

00:38:23.019 --> 00:38:26.591
I should have,
m-a-t-i-g-n-o-n--which were a

00:38:26.591 --> 00:38:30.901
great victory for the workers.
The employers accepted the

00:38:30.901 --> 00:38:33.822
unions as the representatives of
their workers,

00:38:33.822 --> 00:38:36.300
and would negotiate with the
unions,

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.909
and give them a raise of twelve
to fifteen percent.

00:38:39.909 --> 00:38:42.618
They promised the forty-hour
week--and we take that for

00:38:42.618 --> 00:38:44.985
granted;
in France there's a big issue

00:38:44.985 --> 00:38:48.910
over the thirty-five-hour week,
as I'm sure you know--and they

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.714
give paid vacations;
and the paid vacation of a

00:38:51.714 --> 00:38:54.718
month, which many people now in
France can't afford to take,

00:38:54.718 --> 00:38:58.101
comes out of the Popular Front.
They also open up the Louvre,

00:38:58.101 --> 00:39:00.550
free, certain days of the week,
on Sunday.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.639
There's sort of a cultural
revolution as well.

00:39:02.639 --> 00:39:04.559
And you see--oh God,
there's some amazing,

00:39:04.559 --> 00:39:06.760
I wish we had three hours to
talk about this;

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.300
but you probably don't,
but I do.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.080
There are these great
postcards, pictures of people

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.361
that had never seen the ocean
that live fifty miles or fifty

00:39:14.361 --> 00:39:17.595
kilometers from the ocean,
people from Reims and they go

00:39:17.595 --> 00:39:19.754
to Malo-les-Bains,
which is near Dunkirk,

00:39:19.754 --> 00:39:21.526
which is a cold,
frozen beach,

00:39:21.526 --> 00:39:24.224
and they're so proud,
and they're there in their

00:39:24.224 --> 00:39:26.609
bathing suits,
very modest bathing suits,

00:39:26.609 --> 00:39:29.646
and they have their pictures
together with the sea behind

00:39:29.646 --> 00:39:31.592
them;
something they'd never seen

00:39:31.592 --> 00:39:33.215
before.
And lots of sort of

00:39:33.215 --> 00:39:36.309
working-class resorts developed
during that time.

00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:39.899
Not everybody could afford to
go Saint Tropez,

00:39:39.899 --> 00:39:41.893
or Deauville,
or Biarritz,

00:39:41.893 --> 00:39:44.207
or San Rafael,
or, God forbid,

00:39:44.207 --> 00:39:49.156
Cannes, places like that.
So, the working-class vacation

00:39:49.156 --> 00:39:51.455
begins then.
And that's a great moment,

00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:53.860
that's a magic moment,
that's an important moment.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.019
We live in a country in which
nobody ever takes vacation.

00:39:56.019 --> 00:39:58.079
People that are rich can't
afford to take vacations.

00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:00.148
They make all this money,
where are they going to spend

00:40:00.148 --> 00:40:01.162
it?
Well, let's get another

00:40:01.162 --> 00:40:02.950
five-hundred video games,
or something like that.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:05.915
What are they going to do?
In France the right to a

00:40:05.915 --> 00:40:09.625
vacation, even if you can't
afford to take--now people just

00:40:09.625 --> 00:40:12.760
take smaller vacations than they
could before.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.984
But that's an important
conquest, and it came from the

00:40:14.984 --> 00:40:16.284
Popular Front,
and it's a great,

00:40:16.284 --> 00:40:18.376
great, great thing.
Now, the wealthy French

00:40:18.376 --> 00:40:20.139
families don't like this very
much.

00:40:20.139 --> 00:40:23.862
What happens if these people
come to our resorts,

00:40:23.862 --> 00:40:27.429
speaking like they do,
looking like they do?

00:40:27.429 --> 00:40:29.659
They don't like it--what kind
of Republic is this?

00:40:29.659 --> 00:40:32.449
Une Republique
populaire,

00:40:32.449 --> 00:40:39.710
after all.
And, so, the strikes gradually

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.534
end.
But why does the Popular Front

00:40:42.534 --> 00:40:46.162
fail in the long run?
In a way everything wasn't

00:40:46.162 --> 00:40:51.416
possible, it wasn't possible.
One of the reasons it fails is

00:40:51.416 --> 00:40:55.555
because, of course,
the employers have no idea of

00:40:55.555 --> 00:40:58.659
holding to what they'd agreed
to,

00:40:58.659 --> 00:41:01.693
and they violate every
conceivable contract they can as

00:41:01.693 --> 00:41:05.146
quickly as possible.
But the economic crisis--if

00:41:05.146 --> 00:41:09.906
you're trying to make France
more productive and put people

00:41:09.906 --> 00:41:12.578
back to work,
at the time the strategy of

00:41:12.578 --> 00:41:15.346
having people work less,
or for that matter going out on

00:41:15.346 --> 00:41:18.360
strike,
economically didn't really work.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.571
France was a more agricultural
country than,

00:41:21.571 --> 00:41:24.111
say, Germany,
or the United States,

00:41:24.111 --> 00:41:27.920
or Britain, and so the
Depression comes later and it

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.199
stays longer;
though the U.S.

00:41:30.199 --> 00:41:34.898
doesn't get out of the
Depression really until the

00:41:34.898 --> 00:41:39.606
armistice of World War Two.
And the export of currency,

00:41:39.606 --> 00:41:43.459
what wealthy people do in
France and other countries is

00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:46.527
they start taking money,
cash, gold, silver,

00:41:46.527 --> 00:41:49.005
out of the country.
They take them to

00:41:49.005 --> 00:41:51.659
Switzerland--they still do that,
and especially in the 1990s

00:41:51.659 --> 00:41:54.179
they were having to control the
trains to Switzerland and

00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:56.070
Brussels,
to Belgium, because people were

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:57.940
taking money out of the country
and all that,

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:02.616
and not declaring what they had
as income--it just happens all

00:42:02.616 --> 00:42:06.566
the time.
So, Blum does not put controls

00:42:06.566 --> 00:42:12.571
on currency, constraints on
currency, because of opposition

00:42:12.571 --> 00:42:18.679
from the British and the United
States and other places.

00:42:18.679 --> 00:42:21.519
And, so, at this point the
Popular Front begins to unravel.

00:42:21.519 --> 00:42:24.438
Ideologically,
the reformist Socialist Party

00:42:24.438 --> 00:42:27.289
and the Communists remain a
world apart.

00:42:27.289 --> 00:42:29.606
Léon Blum is not going
to say, "occupy permanently the

00:42:29.606 --> 00:42:31.106
factories;
take over the means of

00:42:31.106 --> 00:42:33.981
production, that's all there is
to it"--no, he wasn't going to

00:42:33.981 --> 00:42:36.757
do that.
In March 1937 the police fire

00:42:36.757 --> 00:42:41.739
on workers demonstrating against
the Croix-de-Feu in the Parisian

00:42:41.739 --> 00:42:45.864
suburb of Clichy and the
Communist Party denounces the

00:42:45.864 --> 00:42:48.640
government.
The French stock market goes

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.439
into a tumble;
various advisors resign

00:42:52.439 --> 00:42:58.785
reducing confidence in
Léon Blum's economic

00:42:58.785 --> 00:43:02.079
policies,
and the government had to

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:06.114
devalue the franc several times
because of the flow of gold

00:43:06.114 --> 00:43:09.229
abroad,
and the French financial

00:43:09.229 --> 00:43:13.059
community denounces Léon
Blum.

00:43:13.059 --> 00:43:17.119
But there's another reason,
too, that undercuts the Popular

00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:19.575
Front.
And this of course is Spain,

00:43:19.575 --> 00:43:22.960
because those people who lived
in the late 1930s,

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.993
people who were intellectuals,
people who were students at

00:43:26.993 --> 00:43:30.154
Yale, and Columbia,
and Mighty Michigan,

00:43:30.154 --> 00:43:34.844
and Cal, and other places,
the war in Spain was seen as a

00:43:34.844 --> 00:43:38.503
war of civilization.
At the time people realized

00:43:38.503 --> 00:43:42.035
that it was a dry run for
another big war that was going

00:43:42.035 --> 00:43:44.925
to come along,
that sometime fascism had to be

00:43:44.925 --> 00:43:47.139
stopped.
And Franco, his military

00:43:47.139 --> 00:43:50.532
allegiance, he was actually
number three on the list but the

00:43:50.532 --> 00:43:52.723
first two were killed,
one in combat,

00:43:52.723 --> 00:43:55.791
I guess, and the other one in a
plane accident flying from

00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:58.205
Portugal into Spain.
The revolution,

00:43:58.205 --> 00:44:02.437
counter-revolution really
starts in 1936 in Morocco and

00:44:02.437 --> 00:44:05.692
then in Spain,
and by 1939 in a very bloody

00:44:05.692 --> 00:44:09.468
atrocity-filled war on both
sides, though the atrocities

00:44:09.468 --> 00:44:12.970
were overwhelmingly on the side
of the fascists,

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:17.027
no question about that.
The question was what was going

00:44:17.027 --> 00:44:19.246
to happen in Spain?
And some of the great

00:44:19.246 --> 00:44:21.797
literature that came out of that
period--obviously George

00:44:21.797 --> 00:44:24.029
Orwell's Homage to
Catalonia or Borkenau or

00:44:24.029 --> 00:44:26.807
Brennan--there's all sorts of
great books on Spain from people

00:44:26.807 --> 00:44:29.042
who were there.
The International Brigades were

00:44:29.042 --> 00:44:30.553
full of people from Yale,
and Columbia,

00:44:30.553 --> 00:44:31.864
and Oxford,
and Cambridge,

00:44:31.864 --> 00:44:35.045
and the unions in Detroit going
over to fight the good fight

00:44:35.045 --> 00:44:38.500
against fascism.
But nobody gave arms to Spain,

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:43.037
nobody gave arms to Spain
except the Germans gave arms to

00:44:43.037 --> 00:44:47.344
the authoritarians of Franco.
The Italians tried out their

00:44:47.344 --> 00:44:49.406
tanks there.
The Guernica,

00:44:49.406 --> 00:44:53.204
the most famous painting of the
period of Picasso--you should

00:44:53.204 --> 00:44:57.128
visit Guernica some time--came
when they strafed and bombed the

00:44:57.128 --> 00:45:00.863
civilian population--it was
German planes doing it on behalf

00:45:00.863 --> 00:45:03.306
of Franco.
And Léon Blum goes to

00:45:03.306 --> 00:45:05.894
the Place de la Republique and
there are thousands and

00:45:05.894 --> 00:45:07.944
thousands of people,
and they're screaming,

00:45:07.944 --> 00:45:10.740
"Arms for Spain!
Arms for Spain!

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.286
Arms for Spain!"
And with tears pouring down his

00:45:15.286 --> 00:45:18.290
cheeks he said,
"I can't, I can't."

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:20.934
Well, why couldn't he?
Because the British and the

00:45:20.934 --> 00:45:22.840
Americans didn't want him to do
that.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:27.064
They viewed this as being an
internationalization of a war

00:45:27.064 --> 00:45:30.400
which had already become
internationalized,

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.883
and Spain did not get the
weapons it needed to survive,

00:45:33.883 --> 00:45:36.400
and Franco's regime lasts until
1975,

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:41.409
November 1975,
when he finally expired.

00:45:41.409 --> 00:45:44.626
The War on Spain was one of
those moments--you can look

00:45:44.626 --> 00:45:46.829
back, and I already suggested
this,

00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:49.715
that maybe if they'd stopped
Hitler when they invade the

00:45:49.715 --> 00:45:53.230
Rhineland maybe history would've
been different--could have been,

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:56.355
you never know.
And maybe if they'd stopped

00:45:56.355 --> 00:46:00.311
Franco in 1936 to 1939,
and in doing so stopped the

00:46:00.311 --> 00:46:04.209
Germans and Italians,
maybe history would've been

00:46:04.209 --> 00:46:07.985
different and all these
fifty--who can count?--fifty

00:46:07.985 --> 00:46:12.650
million or sixty million people
who died wouldn't have died.

00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:16.511
Who knows, it's looking back.
But, so far as the Popular

00:46:16.511 --> 00:46:19.596
Front it survived,
but in name only,

00:46:19.596 --> 00:46:22.152
until 1939.
The economic crisis,

00:46:22.152 --> 00:46:25.457
the strike movement and all of
that, which only was

00:46:25.457 --> 00:46:28.300
counterproductive,
and the war of Spain;

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:33.048
and the international situation
came to represent--to bring

00:46:33.048 --> 00:46:36.159
about the defeat of this
government.

00:46:36.159 --> 00:46:37.730
And Léon Blum,
as most of you know,

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:39.793
ends up in jail.
He's lucky during Vichy not to

00:46:39.793 --> 00:46:42.082
have been assassinated,
he survives--or not to have

00:46:42.082 --> 00:46:45.139
been murdered or executed;
he survives the war and is

00:46:45.139 --> 00:46:49.064
active in politics again at the
very beginning of what would

00:46:49.064 --> 00:46:52.501
become the Fourth Republic.
But we live in a world of

00:46:52.501 --> 00:46:54.749
nostalgia, of historical
nostalgia, too,

00:46:54.749 --> 00:46:57.690
and people of my generation--I
wasn't born then,

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:01.071
I assure you,
not even near being born yet

00:47:01.071 --> 00:47:06.102
then--but we grew up listening
to tales of Spain and "Arms for

00:47:06.102 --> 00:47:09.002
Spain."
And if one lives in France,

00:47:09.002 --> 00:47:13.134
lots of the things that are
good about France and sort of

00:47:13.134 --> 00:47:17.267
the protective State in giving
people the right to decent

00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:21.713
conditions--decent healthcare,
museums that are actually open

00:47:21.713 --> 00:47:25.068
and paid vacations--are
something that came out of that

00:47:25.068 --> 00:47:27.428
period.
And, so, one looks sort of back

00:47:27.428 --> 00:47:32.451
with a certain bit of nostalgia.
So, next Wednesday we will move

00:47:32.451 --> 00:47:39.000
on to the fall of France and to
collaboration of World War Two.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.130
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.715
Now today's topic is Weber's
theory of legal-rational

00:00:07.715 --> 00:00:11.420
authority and his theory of
bureaucracy.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.612
This is one of those
questions--those topics--Weber

00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:21.700
is probably the best known for.
 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.140
It's also a rather complicated
issue.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.750
When we are saying
legal-rational authority,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.250
we briefly refer to the rule of
law,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.830
and we tend to associate in our
mind the rule of law with

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.330
liberal market economies and the
liberal democracies.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.540
Well Weber has a very complex
argument about this.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.174
Indeed, legal-rational
authority is the kind of system

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:55.410
of authority which is
predictable,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.900
because there is an observable
law,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.619
everybody is subordinated to,
which,

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:10.721
in fact, has the most--the
clearest elective affinity with

00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:13.090
a market economy.
 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.936
Nevertheless,
as we will see,

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:21.938
he will argue that--which is
very counterintuitive--that the

00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:27.938
purest type of legal-rational
authority is bureaucracy;

00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:32.827
and this is usually what we
don't have in our mind when we

00:01:32.827 --> 00:01:36.772
are thinking about a market
economy, that it is

00:01:36.772 --> 00:01:38.230
bureaucratic.
 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.149
So we have to deal with Weber's
interesting claim that the

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.860
purest type of legal-rational
authority,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.459
which goes together with a
market capitalist economy,

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:52.430
is actually bureaucracy.
 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.828
It's also interesting that
Weber does not make an

00:01:56.828 --> 00:02:01.486
assumption that bureaucracy,
legal-rational authority,

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:05.560
or capitalism necessarily goes
together with democracy.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.582
How democracy fits into the
picture is rather problematic

00:02:10.582 --> 00:02:11.479
for him.
 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.520
Of course, we have to
appreciate that in Weber's--

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.080
when Weber was writing about
these issues,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.900
somewhere between 1914 and
1920, I mean,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.247
virtually none of the countries
in the world were liberal

00:02:29.247 --> 00:02:31.400
democracies or universal
suffrage.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.960
The political systems of the
world changed so much in the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.669
last hundred years.
 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:41.160
But he problematizes this
relationship;

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.060
and it's actually quite useful.
 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.030
So this is the guideline for
today's lecture.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.060
Again I start with the
definition of the ideal type,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.848
the purest type of
legal-rational authority,

00:02:58.848 --> 00:03:04.092
and then I try to dig into this
unusual but very influential

00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:07.296
Weberian argument--
that bureaucracy,

00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:11.780
in fact, is the purest type of
legal-rational authority.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.792
And then I will look at various
kinds of limitations of the

00:03:16.792 --> 00:03:19.990
exercise of bureaucratic
authority.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.800
One is collegiality.
 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.930
The other is functional
division of labor--

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.688
right?--the separation of
various branches of government,

00:03:28.688 --> 00:03:31.169
which is a limitation on
bureaucracy,

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.938
and representation,
democracy, is a limitation on

00:03:34.938 --> 00:03:35.960
government.
 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.455
So you can see that he sees a
tension--right?--between

00:03:39.455 --> 00:03:42.819
democracy, bureaucracy,
legal-rational authority and

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:43.810
capitalism.
 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.925
They do not go as easily
together as usually we Americans

00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:49.910
tend to think about this.
 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:57.383
And then a couple of ideas
about his view about

00:03:57.383 --> 00:03:59.660
democracies.
 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.828
Okay, so let me start with what
is the pure type of

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:09.158
legal-rational authority.
 

00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:14.046
And there are really two issues
we have to very briefly talk

00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:14.710
about.
 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.336
There are different ways how
laws and norms can be

00:04:19.336 --> 00:04:20.660
established.
 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.459
We're already beginning to feel
our way into the problem whether

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:29.040
the rule of law and democracy
are identical,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.850
or, you know,
it can be democratic,

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.990
or does not have to be that
democratic.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.156
And then the question is who
obeys what and whom,

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:43.740
under legal authority?
 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.029
So and a bit about
legal-rational authority.

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:54.283
So the argument
is--right?--that there are

00:04:54.283 --> 00:04:59.680
various ways how laws or norms
can be established.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.324
And well he said,
legal authority rests on the

00:05:05.324 --> 00:05:09.464
acceptance of the following
ideas.

00:05:09.464 --> 00:05:10.720
Right?
 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.682
Well, the norms,
he said, can be established by

00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:19.163
agreement--that's what we
usually think when we think

00:05:19.163 --> 00:05:22.610
about rule of law--or by
imposition;

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.458
it can be imposed on people.
 

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.170
Right?
 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.589
And it can happen on the ground
of expediency.

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:33.607
It can happen because these are
the most useful laws and

00:05:33.607 --> 00:05:38.209
therefore we either agree that
this is what we want to obey,

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:40.829
or there is an authority which
they impose on us.

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:44.529
Or it can be based on value
rationality.

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.470
It may not be that expedient,
may be not necessarily

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.233
immediately useful,
but on the basis of shared

00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:56.600
values, or the values of those
who impose those laws--

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.009
and we tend to believe it--we
will--

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.899
this is the way how it will be
established.

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:09.720
And then, of course,
the legal system has to be

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.767
somewhat consistent--
this is important for the

00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:20.274
predictability of the system--
and has to be intentionally

00:06:20.274 --> 00:06:21.266
established.
 

00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:21.930
Right?
 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.952
This is not coming from
accident, but intentionally

00:06:27.952 --> 00:06:29.639
established.
 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.552
But the major point what I
wanted to make--right?--that

00:06:33.552 --> 00:06:36.521
legal-rational authority,
in Weber's view,

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.709
can be actually an
authoritarian system.

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:45.194
Let's say Chile under Pinochet,
the later times,

00:06:45.194 --> 00:06:49.512
after he
established--consolidated his

00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:53.146
power;
earlier on it was a tyrannical

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:53.639
rule.
 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.531
But later on,
Pinochet established a

00:06:56.531 --> 00:07:00.829
legal-rational order,
though it was not democratic at

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:01.160
all.
 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.069
Right?
 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:06.963
It was operating with a legal
system which was imposed on

00:07:06.963 --> 00:07:07.750
people.
 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:14.297
And in history we have a number
of instances when we can say,

00:07:14.297 --> 00:07:20.189
"This is country is a
country of law and order.

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:24.625
We know what the laws are;
we actually think the laws are

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:25.800
not unreasonable.
 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.490
But it was imposed by some
power upon us."

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.139
Now the next question is who
obeys whom?

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:37.199
And well I don't want to dwell
on this so long.

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:38.240
This is quite clear.
 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.550
You already are familiar with
this.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:45.771
What is important--right?--the
person who is in authority,

00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:50.357
who issues orders,
is himself subject to an

00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:52.649
impersonal order.
 

00:07:52.649 --> 00:07:55.569
So we are all subject to the
same order.

00:07:55.569 --> 00:08:01.701
This is the essence of
legal-rational authority,

00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:05.225
at least in the ideal type.
 

00:08:05.225 --> 00:08:06.399
Right?
 

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:09.180
We know the exceptions to this.
 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.079
We know that Berlusconi,
for instance,

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:15.093
in Italy, though Italy is
really a legal-rational

00:08:15.093 --> 00:08:17.478
authority,
for a long time

00:08:17.478 --> 00:08:23.548
managed--right?--to pass a
legislation which enabled him to

00:08:23.548 --> 00:08:27.764
escape prosecution;
though he's probably involved

00:08:27.764 --> 00:08:30.997
in a number of criminal
activities, but somehow he

00:08:30.997 --> 00:08:33.769
managed to escape criminal
prosecution.

00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:36.210
But that's the exception.
 

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.947
The rule is--right?--that even
the person who is highest in

00:08:40.947 --> 00:08:45.686
charge is subject to the same
authority and has to obey the

00:08:45.686 --> 00:08:46.340
law.
 

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:52.514
And this is again very obvious;
we already covered this,

00:08:52.514 --> 00:08:54.863
the opposite,
the mirror image of it.

00:08:54.863 --> 00:08:55.450
Right?
 

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:01.451
The members of the society of
obedience, to the superior,

00:09:01.451 --> 00:09:06.595
not as an individual,
but to an impersonal order,

00:09:06.595 --> 00:09:09.059
to the law as such.
 

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:10.830
That should be quite obvious.
 

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:16.644
Now so what are the major
characteristics of a system

00:09:16.644 --> 00:09:21.230
which is based on legal-rational
order?

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.918
There is a continuous
rule-bound conduct.

00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:29.937
It's again, I think,
does not call for too much

00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:32.028
clarification.
 

00:09:32.028 --> 00:09:35.440
It is continuously the same
rules.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.499
The rules change slowly and
with a great deal of

00:09:39.499 --> 00:09:43.125
difficulties,
as we can see how Congress is

00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:47.788
struggling to pass a law about
health care reform.

00:09:47.788 --> 00:09:52.659
It takes months or years before
an important new piece of

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:55.269
legislation gets into place.
 

00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:58.225
And usually new pieces of
legislations,

00:09:58.225 --> 00:10:01.802
in legal-rational authority,
are grandfathered.

00:10:01.802 --> 00:10:02.580
Right?
 

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.302
If you pass a new law,
you change the rules of the

00:10:05.302 --> 00:10:07.360
game, you usually grandfather
them;

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.591
those who entered the game
before the new law are still

00:10:11.591 --> 00:10:14.100
under the rule of the old law.
 

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.916
We do that at the universities
all the time.

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:17.440
Right?
 

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.820
If, for instance,
the degree requirements do

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.731
change in a university,
almost always these degree

00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:27.652
requirements are--
this new legislation is

00:10:27.652 --> 00:10:29.029
grandfathered.
 

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:31.720
You know the terminology. Right?
 

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.658
It will not apply to people who
are already in the program.

00:10:35.658 --> 00:10:39.418
It will only apply to people
who are entering the program.

00:10:39.418 --> 00:10:44.932
Or one way of grandfathering
it, that we give people a

00:10:44.932 --> 00:10:45.870
choice.
 

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:46.658
You know?
 

00:10:46.658 --> 00:10:48.527
If you want to operate under
the new rule,

00:10:48.527 --> 00:10:51.962
you can opt for the new rule;
or if you want to stay under

00:10:51.962 --> 00:10:55.070
the old rule,
you can stay under old rule.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.764
Only for those are the new
rules binding who are entering

00:10:59.764 --> 00:11:01.190
the system now.
 

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.919
So that's very
important--right?--that it is

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:07.350
continuous and rule-bound.
 

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.264
And he also said in
legal-rational authority there

00:11:11.264 --> 00:11:15.740
must be a very clear separation
of spheres of competence.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.538
Right?
 

00:11:16.538 --> 00:11:20.139
Who is competent to carry out
what?

00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:24.836
And then you can always figure
out how you navigate in a

00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:26.798
legal-rational order.
 

00:11:26.798 --> 00:11:29.691
You will be told,
"Well, this is not my

00:11:29.691 --> 00:11:32.178
table, you go somewhere
else."

00:11:32.178 --> 00:11:36.856
So you go and you ask something
from the director of

00:11:36.856 --> 00:11:40.243
undergraduate studies,
and the director of

00:11:40.243 --> 00:11:43.806
undergraduate studies might say,
"Go and see the dean of

00:11:43.806 --> 00:11:47.073
your residential college"--
right?--"because that is

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:49.870
the sphere of competence of the
residential college."

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.591
That's the way how
legal-rational order is supposed

00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:54.558
to operate.
 

00:11:54.558 --> 00:11:57.442
And the same,
occasionally the dean of

00:11:57.442 --> 00:12:01.070
college will say,
"Well, you have to see

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.105
your sociology professor,
or your economics

00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:05.014
professor."
 

00:12:05.014 --> 00:12:05.470
Right?
 

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.440
You want to get transfer
credit, for instance,

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.389
for a summer course,
and then the dean of college

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:12.793
well said,
"It is the

00:12:12.793 --> 00:12:15.610
department"--
be it political science or

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.562
economics or anthropology--
"they will be able to tell

00:12:20.562 --> 00:12:25.250
whether this can be accepted as
an economics course at

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.110
Yale." Right?
 

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:31.520
And this also implies that
there is always a hierarchy and

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.070
a right to appeal.
 

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.038
This is--again,
you are very familiar with it.

00:12:36.038 --> 00:12:41.163
You know exactly if you get a
grade from your discussion

00:12:41.163 --> 00:12:45.683
section leader,
you can appeal to the professor

00:12:45.683 --> 00:12:47.967
to say,
"Well, I don't think it's

00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:48.990
a fair enough grade.
 

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.389
I deserve a better grade.
 

00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:53.629
My section leader made an
error."

00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:57.543
And if you are unhappy with the
response of the professor,

00:12:57.543 --> 00:13:01.253
you go to the chair of the
department and appeal to the

00:13:01.253 --> 00:13:01.940
chair.
 

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:07.294
There is a whole hierarchy of
appeal--right?--where you can

00:13:07.294 --> 00:13:11.450
try to correct what you think is
not right.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:16.009
So I think it's extremely
important that you know exactly

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:20.570
what is the chain of appeal and
how far you can go up.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.912
Usually there is also some
specialized training which is

00:13:25.912 --> 00:13:30.769
expected for people to occupy
certain positions.

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:37.683
So well discussion section
leaders will always be at least

00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:42.351
graduate students;
usually, well,

00:13:42.351 --> 00:13:49.876
people can teach their own
course once they were

00:13:49.876 --> 00:13:53.879
passed--they are Ph.D.
 

00:13:53.879 --> 00:13:57.674
students but all what they have
is a dissertation to finish,

00:13:57.674 --> 00:13:59.541
or they must have their Ph.D.
 

00:13:59.541 --> 00:14:00.120
Right?
 

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.918
So there is a specialized
training necessary to perform

00:14:03.918 --> 00:14:05.960
certain functions,
as such.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.200
And that's an interesting and
very complex idea--

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.123
right?--that the staff has to
be separated from the ownership

00:14:15.123 --> 00:14:18.000
of means of production and
administration.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.450
This is even more important for
Weber's argument.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:28.375
Being separated--it's not that
easy to penetrate what he

00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:31.330
exactly wants to say with this.
 

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.321
What does it mean that you do
not own the means of

00:14:34.321 --> 00:14:35.360
administration?
 

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.086
It basically means that the
source of rules and laws are

00:14:40.086 --> 00:14:43.440
outside of the administrator as
such.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.408
If you want to have any change
in the rules,

00:14:46.408 --> 00:14:50.215
there must be some procedure
which is beyond the person who

00:14:50.215 --> 00:14:54.222
is administering that rules,
how the rules can be changed.

00:14:54.222 --> 00:14:54.700
Right?
 

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.691
This in order--you have to
prevent unpredictability in the

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:00.480
system.
 

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.500
And that's why rules change all
the time.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:10.433
But the fundamental principle
is that these rules should not

00:15:10.433 --> 00:15:14.557
be allowed to be changed by the
person who

00:15:14.557 --> 00:15:18.278
administers--right?--those
rules.

00:15:18.278 --> 00:15:24.389
So just to give a very trivial
example,

00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:30.368
once you got your syllabus and
the course requirement and what

00:15:30.368 --> 00:15:36.149
kind of assignments you have to
deliver during the course in

00:15:36.149 --> 00:15:40.070
order to get credit in this
course,

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:46.788
then well working out these
rules, a professor plays a role.

00:15:46.788 --> 00:15:50.674
But we have to get approved by
the Courses and Curriculum

00:15:50.674 --> 00:15:54.769
Committee, and then in a way we
are bound by those rules.

00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:58.190
So on the way I could not
announce you today,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.509
"Well I changed my mind
and there will be an unseen

00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:06.514
final examination where you will
have to get a final

00:16:06.514 --> 00:16:09.849
examination--
right?--and you will not know

00:16:09.849 --> 00:16:13.293
what questions I will ask,
and I can ask any question for

00:16:13.293 --> 00:16:14.456
the whole course."
 

00:16:14.456 --> 00:16:14.860
Right?
 

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.865
If I would
change--right?--these rules

00:16:17.865 --> 00:16:22.250
right now, you would have,
I'm sure, appeal against me,

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.875
against my decision.
 

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:24.769
Right?
 

00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:26.200
I'm bound by rules.
 

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.722
So that means that I don't own
the means of administration.

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:30.210
Right?
 

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.498
I am
administering--right?--what is

00:16:33.498 --> 00:16:35.240
in the syllabus.
 

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.485
Well there is a little leeway.
 

00:16:37.485 --> 00:16:38.009
Right?
 

00:16:38.009 --> 00:16:42.490
Occasionally I can give you an
extension, for instance,

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.149
if you come to me.
 

00:16:44.149 --> 00:16:47.907
Therefore it's--there is a
little flexibility in the

00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:48.570
system.
 

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:53.176
But fundamentally the course
should be taught as it is in the

00:16:53.176 --> 00:16:57.552
syllabus, and the requirements
should be like it is in the

00:16:57.552 --> 00:16:58.548
syllabus.
 

00:16:58.548 --> 00:17:01.913
That's what it
means--right?--that you do not

00:17:01.913 --> 00:17:03.460
own--
right?--the means of

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.192
administration,
unlike in traditional authority

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:12.127
where a feudal lord does have--
does own, appropriated,

00:17:12.127 --> 00:17:16.150
some means of administration
from the monarch.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:25.828
And a British or a French high
aristocracy could make rules;

00:17:25.828 --> 00:17:31.730
not implement the rules,
but could make rules as well.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:36.248
The unique feature of modern
legal-rational authority is that

00:17:36.248 --> 00:17:39.108
this becomes an impersonal
process,

00:17:39.108 --> 00:17:44.432
which is not done--there is a
separation between those who

00:17:44.432 --> 00:17:48.077
implement the rules,
and there is a separate

00:17:48.077 --> 00:17:50.644
procedure--right?--
how the rules are being

00:17:50.644 --> 00:17:51.358
established.
 

00:17:51.358 --> 00:17:55.178
Is that reasonably clear,
what ownership of means of

00:17:55.178 --> 00:17:56.900
administration means?
 

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.836
As I pointed out,
it's a very Weberian idea.

00:18:00.836 --> 00:18:01.568
Right?
 

00:18:01.568 --> 00:18:06.217
For Marx--right?--the whole
issue is the ownership of means

00:18:06.217 --> 00:18:07.500
of production.
 

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:13.232
For Weber this is everything
about the administrations-- the

00:18:13.232 --> 00:18:15.759
means of administration.
 

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:20.188
Okay, now we come to this very
interesting Weberian theory of

00:18:20.188 --> 00:18:22.920
the bureaucracy:
very interesting,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.276
very controversial,
in many ways very

00:18:25.276 --> 00:18:26.519
counterintuitive.
 

00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:28.759
You may say it is false.
 

00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:31.990
Well we will see.
 

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.880
That is a nice topic for
discussion sections.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.309
And this is what I will go
through--a number of issues.

00:18:40.309 --> 00:18:42.529
What is a bureaucracy?
 

00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:45.897
Weber makes this quite
incredible claim,

00:18:45.897 --> 00:18:51.165
what first you will completely
reject, that the most efficient

00:18:51.165 --> 00:18:53.930
organization is the bureaucracy.
 

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:54.880
Right?
 

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.720
That's exactly the opposite
what you think.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.942
When something is very
inefficient, then you say,

00:18:59.942 --> 00:19:02.627
"Well this is so
bureaucratic."

00:19:02.627 --> 00:19:03.298
Right?
 

00:19:03.298 --> 00:19:07.827
Weber nevertheless claims that
the most efficient organization

00:19:07.827 --> 00:19:09.088
is bureaucracy.
 

00:19:09.088 --> 00:19:13.060
Then the question is how is
bureaucracy related to

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.250
capitalism and socialism?
 

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.548
Is really capitalism a
bureaucratic organization?

00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:21.921
What is the relationship
between capitalist market

00:19:21.921 --> 00:19:23.710
economy and bureaucracy?
 

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.288
What are the consequences of
bureaucracy?

00:19:26.288 --> 00:19:29.292
And also then some
contradiction of

00:19:29.292 --> 00:19:31.058
bureaucratization.
 

00:19:31.058 --> 00:19:36.029
Now let's just quickly rush
through what are the

00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:39.730
characteristics of a
bureaucracy.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.395
Well, he said,
"the purest type of legal

00:19:43.395 --> 00:19:46.318
authority"--
this is, as I said,

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:49.887
counterintuitive--
"is that one which employs

00:19:49.887 --> 00:19:52.980
a bureaucratic administrative
staff."

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:59.053
And well what are the
characteristics of this staff in

00:19:59.053 --> 00:20:02.950
order to qualify to bureaucracy?
 

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.690
Well they have to be personally
free.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:09.386
So it cannot be
clients--right?--of a mentor.

00:20:09.386 --> 00:20:10.058
Right?
 

00:20:10.058 --> 00:20:13.730
They are legally free
individuals.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.080
That makes it so
different--right?--from a

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.630
traditional organization.
 

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.943
That's why a family is not a
bureaucratic organization,

00:20:21.943 --> 00:20:24.740
because you are not there by
choice.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.538
Right?
 

00:20:25.538 --> 00:20:30.789
And then a bureaucracy is
organized into a hierarchy of

00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:33.018
offices--
this is something which

00:20:33.018 --> 00:20:38.615
basically we already covered--
and the offices are filled by a

00:20:38.615 --> 00:20:44.153
free contract,
and in this contract what your

00:20:44.153 --> 00:20:46.974
qualification is,
that's what we

00:20:46.974 --> 00:20:48.200
call--right?--meritocracy.
 

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.665
People do have a certain
degree, and that degree

00:20:51.665 --> 00:20:55.650
qualifies them to be incumbents
of a certain office.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.710
And they receive a fixed salary.
 

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:04.492
It's not quite a bureaucratic
organization if you are working

00:21:04.492 --> 00:21:06.132
for a commission.
 

00:21:06.132 --> 00:21:07.000
Right?
 

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.637
You are really in a
bureaucratic organization when

00:21:10.637 --> 00:21:14.797
you sign a contract and you know
exactly what your fringe

00:21:14.797 --> 00:21:19.028
benefits will be and what your
annual salary will be.

00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:24.849
Typically the office is the
sole occupation of the

00:21:24.849 --> 00:21:29.839
incumbents, and it constitutes a
career.

00:21:29.839 --> 00:21:34.299
This is also very important;
again, very different from a

00:21:34.299 --> 00:21:39.046
traditional organization where
people could actually be

00:21:39.046 --> 00:21:43.880
incumbents of a number of
positions and could draw,

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.029
in fact, even incomes from a
number of positions.

00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:50.730
In a pure bureaucratic
organization,

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:55.700
you really can have only a
single occupation.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:02.403
If, for instance,
somebody is appointed with

00:22:02.403 --> 00:22:07.335
tenure to Yale,
and is coming from another

00:22:07.335 --> 00:22:10.333
institution,
he'll have to resign from his

00:22:10.333 --> 00:22:12.890
or her tenure at the other
institution.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:17.152
If you are employed by Yale,
you can be only a Yale

00:22:17.152 --> 00:22:20.354
employee;
you cannot hold multiple jobs

00:22:20.354 --> 00:22:21.759
at the same time.
 

00:22:21.759 --> 00:22:25.578
And it constitutes a career.
 

00:22:25.578 --> 00:22:27.838
The career means there is a
ladder.

00:22:27.838 --> 00:22:31.455
You have some sense how you
will progress in this

00:22:31.455 --> 00:22:33.338
bureaucratic hierarchy.
 

00:22:33.338 --> 00:22:37.604
Again, universities are
classical bureaucracies--that

00:22:37.604 --> 00:22:40.720
you enter as an assistant
professor;

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.228
then you are,
seven to nine years,

00:22:43.228 --> 00:22:46.798
depending on the institution,
without tenure;

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:48.730
then you are being promoted to
tenure;

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.559
then you expect at one point of
time to become a full professor;

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:54.358
blah-blah-blah. Right?
 

00:22:54.358 --> 00:22:56.019
This is what it meant,
it is a career.

00:22:56.019 --> 00:22:58.395
And in many bureaucratic
organizations,

00:22:58.395 --> 00:23:01.586
even in the business
world--right?--you have a sense

00:23:01.586 --> 00:23:02.900
how you progress.
 

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:08.092
In a law firm--right?--if you
enter a law firm--right?--you

00:23:08.092 --> 00:23:12.151
have a pretty clear idea;
it's actually very similar to

00:23:12.151 --> 00:23:13.170
the universities.
 

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:17.050
Usually for seven years you are
working for the law firm,

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.863
and that's when you can
become--right?--a partner in the

00:23:20.863 --> 00:23:21.487
law firm.
 

00:23:21.487 --> 00:23:22.250
Right?
 

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:28.558
So you have a sense how your
career will unfold.

00:23:28.558 --> 00:23:40.009
Well this is something we
already kind of covered--

00:23:40.009 --> 00:23:42.800
right?--that you are separated
from the means of

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.067
administration,
because you are subjected to

00:23:47.067 --> 00:23:49.808
discipline and control.
 

00:23:49.808 --> 00:23:52.400
Now comes the very
controversial idea,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.920
and that we have to talk about
it.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.901
Weber's claim,
which is very much against

00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:04.263
commonsense,
that the purely bureaucratic

00:24:04.263 --> 00:24:09.342
type of administration is
capable of attaining the highest

00:24:09.342 --> 00:24:11.480
degree of efficiency.
 

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.717
Well let me,
on the other hand,

00:24:14.717 --> 00:24:19.788
from this citation,
underline an important point

00:24:19.788 --> 00:24:20.759
here.
 

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:25.911
And this is--of course Weber
was talking about a very

00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:30.690
specific type of organization,
bureaucracies,

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:34.358
which were, relatively
speaking,

00:24:34.358 --> 00:24:37.048
historically quite
efficient--right?--

00:24:37.048 --> 00:24:39.269
the Prussian type of
bureaucracy.

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:43.044
But here he emphasizes--and
these are two very important

00:24:43.044 --> 00:24:46.542
words--"from the technical
point of view."

00:24:46.542 --> 00:24:47.230
Right?
 

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.950
The bureaucracy,
from the technical point of

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.670
view, is the most efficient
organization.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:57.221
It does not necessarily mean
that it does achieve the highest

00:24:57.221 --> 00:25:01.013
welfare for people who are
seeking to navigate in a

00:25:01.013 --> 00:25:03.288
bureaucratic organization.
 

00:25:03.288 --> 00:25:08.660
But technically speaking,
it is the most efficient.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:09.259
Why?
 

00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:12.538
Because it has a very high
degree of predictability.

00:25:12.538 --> 00:25:16.255
I mean, this predictability
might suggest that it will take

00:25:16.255 --> 00:25:19.970
you a long time to get through
of that bloody red tape--

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.150
right?--what the bureaucracy
imposes on you.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.578
But you know exactly the red
tape, and you know,

00:25:25.578 --> 00:25:29.080
if you are stuck,
how to try to appeal and to get

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.759
the process moving.
 

00:25:30.759 --> 00:25:36.079
And therefore the crucial issue
he said, why the bureaucracy is

00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:39.339
so efficient,
because it is technically

00:25:39.339 --> 00:25:42.430
competent and it is predictable.
 

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:52.555
And this is what makes it
actually so--to fit so well with

00:25:52.555 --> 00:25:54.509
a market.
 

00:25:54.509 --> 00:25:59.288
Well he said,
"And what else?"

00:25:59.288 --> 00:26:04.428
If it is not bureaucracy,
how can you otherwise organize

00:26:04.428 --> 00:26:06.108
an organization?
 

00:26:06.108 --> 00:26:08.449
If it is not done
bureaucratically,

00:26:08.449 --> 00:26:10.099
then it is dilettantism.
 

00:26:10.099 --> 00:26:10.720
Right?
 

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.720
And you may want to think about
this.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:23.806
Now here comes the question
about how does bureaucracy and

00:26:23.806 --> 00:26:27.068
capitalism fits into?
 

00:26:27.068 --> 00:26:33.250
And now he makes a very
intriguing, very provocative

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.220
claim.
 

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:38.818
I think it is very deep,
and deserves your attention.

00:26:38.818 --> 00:26:42.513
He said, "The primary
source of superiority in a

00:26:42.513 --> 00:26:46.848
bureaucratic administration lies
in technical knowledge."

00:26:46.848 --> 00:26:47.558
Right?
 

00:26:47.558 --> 00:26:53.440
Bureaucracy is domination
through knowledge.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:59.291
Well, a very provocative,
very important claim.

00:26:59.291 --> 00:27:00.308
Right?
 

00:27:00.308 --> 00:27:04.306
Bureaucracy is--right?--the par
excellence meritocratic

00:27:04.306 --> 00:27:07.281
organization--
right?--where people who are

00:27:07.281 --> 00:27:10.804
issuing command are issuing
command with the assumptions

00:27:10.804 --> 00:27:14.710
that they are the most competent
people to carry this out.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:18.586
Well whether this is the case
or not--you remember,

00:27:18.586 --> 00:27:23.240
Weber is always operating with
ideal types, or pure types.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.808
The concrete cases may be
different from it.

00:27:26.808 --> 00:27:31.776
You may have people who are not
competent to exercise the

00:27:31.776 --> 00:27:34.880
authority, what they do
exercise.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.038
But I think it is important
that you have the ideal type,

00:27:38.038 --> 00:27:40.858
because then you can be upset,
and you say,

00:27:40.858 --> 00:27:42.268
"These bloody
bastards."

00:27:42.268 --> 00:27:42.609
Right?
 

00:27:42.609 --> 00:27:45.108
"It is incompetent;
cannot do the job."

00:27:45.108 --> 00:27:47.279
And then you can appeal and to
say,

00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:48.750
"Why don't you remove this
person,

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.432
because this person does not
know what his or her job

00:27:51.432 --> 00:27:52.000
is?"
 

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.470
And actually such appeal very
often is consequential.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:00.700
People occasionally are removed
their position if their

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.598
incompetence is being
demonstrated.

00:28:03.598 --> 00:28:07.505
Well this is very difficult to
do at a university,

00:28:07.505 --> 00:28:11.809
because universities,
we have this system of tenure.

00:28:11.809 --> 00:28:12.900
You know?
 

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.929
After you've suffered for seven
years as an assistant professor,

00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:20.510
you are promoted to tenure,
and then it is very difficult

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.430
to get you out of the job.
 

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.298
But even at the university this
is possible.

00:28:25.298 --> 00:28:28.750
If you find out that I'm
completely incompetent--

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.608
right?--you document that I am
incompetent--

00:28:31.608 --> 00:28:35.186
right?--that I am just
misinterpreting all the authors

00:28:35.186 --> 00:28:36.200
you had here.
 

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.806
And then you can
appeal--right?--to the

00:28:38.806 --> 00:28:43.059
university, and you can say that
I really should be removed;

00:28:43.059 --> 00:28:46.088
my tenure should be invoked.
 

00:28:46.088 --> 00:28:50.108
And if I'm found to be
incompetent, I will lose my job;

00:28:50.108 --> 00:28:54.788
but the only way to do it,
is through my incompetence.

00:28:54.788 --> 00:28:57.343
But actually universities very
rarely do it,

00:28:57.343 --> 00:28:59.660
because it's a very painful
exercise.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.972
But because they are
bureaucracies there

00:29:01.972 --> 00:29:05.710
is--right?--the rule that it can
happen, and it should happen in

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:06.660
these cases.
 

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.689
And then he said,
"Well from this point of

00:29:10.689 --> 00:29:13.778
view,
it really does not matter

00:29:13.778 --> 00:29:19.509
whether an economy is organized
as a capitalistic economy,

00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:23.605
based on private ownership,
or whether it is organized as a

00:29:23.605 --> 00:29:25.970
socialist economy,
based on public

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:26.910
ownership."
 

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:27.380
Right?
 

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.578
And, in fact,
now he goes even further;

00:29:29.578 --> 00:29:32.690
and it's very interesting what
he's got to say here.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:37.920
He's writing somewhere in
1919,1920.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.971
The Soviet Union already
exists, Soviet Russia already

00:29:41.971 --> 00:29:42.660
exists.
 

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.473
There is already a society
which calls itself socialist,

00:29:46.473 --> 00:29:49.038
which eliminated private
ownership.

00:29:49.038 --> 00:29:51.702
And he said,
"Well socialism would

00:29:51.702 --> 00:29:55.978
require a still higher degree of
formal bureaucratization than

00:29:55.978 --> 00:29:57.450
capitalism."
 

00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:59.348
That's a very interesting idea.
 

00:29:59.348 --> 00:30:01.548
Though until now he
suggested--right?--

00:30:01.548 --> 00:30:05.896
that the bureaucratic
organization fits the best with

00:30:05.896 --> 00:30:09.615
free market economy,
now he said actually socialism

00:30:09.615 --> 00:30:11.528
will be even more bureaucratic.
 

00:30:11.528 --> 00:30:15.816
And then I think what comes
very--it's a very intriguing

00:30:15.816 --> 00:30:17.380
idea,
and he said,

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:22.157
"But the big problem with
socialism is that there will be

00:30:22.157 --> 00:30:26.308
a big conflict here between the
formal rationality and

00:30:26.308 --> 00:30:30.519
substantive rationality,
what the bureaucracy carries

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:31.250
out."
 

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:35.760
And you know by now--right?--or
you have at least a hunch what

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.049
he's getting at between formal
and substantive rationality.

00:30:40.049 --> 00:30:40.788
Right?
 

00:30:40.788 --> 00:30:43.994
Formal rationality is that you
are simply implementing the

00:30:43.994 --> 00:30:45.118
rules of the game.
 

00:30:45.118 --> 00:30:50.852
Substantive rationality is you
are actually concerned with the

00:30:50.852 --> 00:30:55.269
welfare, the substantive goals
of the action.

00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:57.766
And he said,
"Well, if you have a

00:30:57.766 --> 00:31:01.134
publicly owned economy,
centrally planned economy,

00:31:01.134 --> 00:31:04.923
then the central planners make
substantive decisions about the

00:31:04.923 --> 00:31:05.980
economy."
 

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.986
They decide,
for instance,

00:31:07.986 --> 00:31:12.240
where government or taxpayer
money should go to--which

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.496
branches of the economy should
be investment going to.

00:31:16.496 --> 00:31:17.460
Right?
 

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.695
In a capitalist economy,
governments typically cannot do

00:31:20.695 --> 00:31:20.990
that.
 

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.519
Right?
 

00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:23.490
They set the rules of the game.
 

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:27.143
Well the best--they manage
interest rates and they may be

00:31:27.143 --> 00:31:30.078
able to manage the currency
exchange rate,

00:31:30.078 --> 00:31:34.190
but they cannot allocate
resources across the economy.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.619
Of if they do,
then people will say,

00:31:36.619 --> 00:31:39.605
"We are on the road to
socialism."

00:31:39.605 --> 00:31:40.298
Right?
 

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:44.088
To the extent substantive
rationality is involved.

00:31:44.088 --> 00:31:46.413
But he said,
"Well if it is socialism,

00:31:46.413 --> 00:31:48.405
there will be this big
tension."

00:31:48.405 --> 00:31:48.960
Right?
 

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.563
You cannot be at the same time
formally rational and

00:31:52.563 --> 00:31:54.328
substantively rational.
 

00:31:54.328 --> 00:31:58.727
You either consider the content
of your decisions,

00:31:58.727 --> 00:32:03.482
or you are concerned simply
with the procedures of the

00:32:03.482 --> 00:32:04.650
decision.
 

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:07.794
If you are concerned with the
procedure, that is formal

00:32:07.794 --> 00:32:08.608
rationality.
 

00:32:08.608 --> 00:32:12.077
If you are concerned with the
content, that is substantive

00:32:12.077 --> 00:32:12.930
rationality.
 

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:17.088
Let me just give you one
example about the legal system.

00:32:17.088 --> 00:32:21.948
Indeed, in Communist
societies--and probably to some

00:32:21.948 --> 00:32:27.307
extent even China today,
much less so than it was let's

00:32:27.307 --> 00:32:32.586
say thirty of forty years ago--
well when justice is being

00:32:32.586 --> 00:32:37.143
served by the court,
the court is not blind to who

00:32:37.143 --> 00:32:42.710
the people who are being accused
of committing some crime is.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:50.420
The communist legal system
called itself a class law;

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:54.009
that, in fact,
the purpose of the legal system

00:32:54.009 --> 00:32:58.318
is not to be blind--right?--who
committed the crime.

00:32:58.318 --> 00:33:02.496
The purpose of the legal system
is--that was the kind of

00:33:02.496 --> 00:33:05.990
legitimacy claim under
Communism--to defend the

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.344
interests of the working class.
 

00:33:08.344 --> 00:33:09.180
Right?
 

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.039
And therefore that was
specifically a legal system

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:15.561
based on substantive
rationality.

00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:16.348
Right?
 

00:33:16.348 --> 00:33:23.278
Well capitalist legal systems
tend to be procedurally--ri

00:33:23.278 --> 00:33:28.970
ght?--rationalistic,
formally rationalistic.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:34.323
In principle it doesn't matter
who the person is when you are

00:33:34.323 --> 00:33:35.930
serving justice.
 

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:38.368
This is again the ideal. Right?
 

00:33:38.368 --> 00:33:43.992
In concrete cases actually
judges might consider some

00:33:43.992 --> 00:33:50.156
substantive characteristics of
the person who is on trial,

00:33:50.156 --> 00:33:54.048
not simply to implement the
law.

00:33:54.048 --> 00:33:58.253
May consider as mitigating
circumstances--right?--for

00:33:58.253 --> 00:34:01.650
instance, when they are passing
the law.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.877
And, of course,
there are other reasons how

00:34:03.877 --> 00:34:06.690
actually substantive
considerations enter the game.

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:07.660
You know?
 

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:11.567
If you are white and rich,
you can hire a better defense

00:34:11.567 --> 00:34:15.688
lawyer and your chances to get
off the hook within the same

00:34:15.688 --> 00:34:17.179
rules are better.
 

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.949
So substantive considerations
enter the thing.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:23.250
But that's the exception;
that's not supposed to happen.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.509
We are angry when this happens.
 

00:34:25.509 --> 00:34:26.018
Right?
 

00:34:26.018 --> 00:34:29.056
We want to have a faceless
legal system.

00:34:29.056 --> 00:34:29.679
Right?
 

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:32.230
Justice is blind. Right?
 

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:36.155
This blindness of justice
means--right?--this is simply

00:34:36.155 --> 00:34:39.862
procedurally just--right?--and
not substantively so.

00:34:39.862 --> 00:34:40.590
Right?
 

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:44.909
This is why justice is shown
with blind eyes.

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:49.239
Now what are the consequences
of bureaucratization?

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.768
Here are some of them.
 

00:34:51.768 --> 00:34:54.820
He said there is a tendency of
leveling of interest;

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:59.248
since everybody is in principle
equal before the law and

00:34:59.248 --> 00:35:02.230
therefore interest will be
leveled.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:06.324
You are not supposed to take
into account people's position

00:35:06.324 --> 00:35:06.889
in it.
 

00:35:06.889 --> 00:35:10.242
Well there is a
tendency--meritocratic

00:35:10.242 --> 00:35:15.405
tendency--that people higher up
will have higher levels of

00:35:15.405 --> 00:35:19.030
training, or more training,
as such.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:26.590
And--this is again justice is
blind--

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:33.375
what is important is that the
essence of a bureaucracy has to

00:35:33.375 --> 00:35:39.822
be a formalistic impersonality:
sine ira et studio,

00:35:39.822 --> 00:35:42.875
without hatred and passion.
 

00:35:42.875 --> 00:35:44.119
Right?
 

00:35:44.119 --> 00:35:47.971
This is why occasionally you
are kind of upset when you are

00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:50.230
confronted with the bureaucracy.
 

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.768
You have a special problem--you
know?--

00:35:52.768 --> 00:35:56.016
and then the bureaucracy tends
to be insensitive to your

00:35:56.016 --> 00:36:00.503
special problem--
right?--,when it is a real

00:36:00.503 --> 00:36:02.054
bureaucracy.
 

00:36:02.054 --> 00:36:03.090
Right?
 

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:07.525
You can say,
"I just had a fight with

00:36:07.525 --> 00:36:13.800
my partner and this is why I
cannot take the test."

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.409
Well, sine ira et studio.
 

00:36:16.409 --> 00:36:20.820
I mean, in a real bureaucratic,
discussion leader or professor

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.699
will say, "Too bad.
 

00:36:22.699 --> 00:36:24.659
This is your personal business.
 

00:36:24.659 --> 00:36:27.092
The test is right now."
 

00:36:27.092 --> 00:36:27.699
Right?
 

00:36:27.699 --> 00:36:29.190
"You take it or leave
it."

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:32.923
Well, I mean,
we are usually not that stupid

00:36:32.923 --> 00:36:34.139
bureaucrats.
 

00:36:34.139 --> 00:36:36.789
But that's the spirit of
bureaucracy.

00:36:36.789 --> 00:36:37.380
Right?
 

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:42.784
Without hatred and passion;
that also means that you are

00:36:42.784 --> 00:36:47.460
not motivated by personal
feelings.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.456
You don't differentiate this is
a person I like and then I give

00:36:51.456 --> 00:36:54.393
preferences;
or dislike, and therefore give

00:36:54.393 --> 00:36:55.409
a worse grade.
 

00:36:55.409 --> 00:36:59.858
All right, there are a number
of contradictions of

00:36:59.858 --> 00:37:01.130
bureaucracy.
 

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:08.110
It is very formalistic.
 

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:13.420
And he said there is also
another interesting tendency.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:20.047
Though it is formalistic and
it's supposed to go simply by

00:37:20.047 --> 00:37:22.891
the rules,
occasionally,

00:37:22.891 --> 00:37:28.440
not only under socialism,
in all systems the bureaucracy

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:34.000
tends to have some sensitivity
to substantive rationality,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.409
to the welfare of the people
who are under the bureaucracy.

00:37:39.409 --> 00:37:43.550
And then it can be turned into
a clientalistic system;

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:47.260
the bureaucracy can have these
tendencies.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:51.447
And think about welfare
bureaucracies--right?--which do

00:37:51.447 --> 00:37:55.324
have a great deal of
clientalistic tendencies built

00:37:55.324 --> 00:37:56.409
into them.
 

00:37:56.409 --> 00:38:00.411
Well, and there are these
various limitations of

00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:02.539
bureaucratic authority.
 

00:38:02.539 --> 00:38:05.360
One is collegiality,
division of powers,

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.880
and representation.
 

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:11.547
Well I don't want to dwell too
long on the notion of

00:38:11.547 --> 00:38:12.920
collegiality.
 

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:24.588
Collegiality,
he says, really grows out of

00:38:24.588 --> 00:38:38.817
what we knew as professional
groups or professional

00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:43.940
organizations.
 

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:50.039
There are different ways how
collegiality can operate.

00:38:50.039 --> 00:38:55.815
One way--that means that you
are interacting with other

00:38:55.815 --> 00:39:02.659
people in the same organization,
on the basis of collegiality.

00:39:02.659 --> 00:39:07.630
You can get a good sense of
this collegiality;

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:10.802
for instance,
it's very important in the

00:39:10.802 --> 00:39:12.510
medical profession.
 

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:17.949
If you go to a doctor for a
second opinion,

00:39:17.949 --> 00:39:22.137
this doctor is really not
supposed to say that his or her

00:39:22.137 --> 00:39:24.599
colleague,
the other doctor,

00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:29.775
really screwed it and he gave
you the wrong diagnosis or the

00:39:29.775 --> 00:39:31.003
wrong therapy.
 

00:39:31.003 --> 00:39:31.880
Right?
 

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.547
Collegiality means that you
stick together--right?--that the

00:39:35.547 --> 00:39:37.349
profession sticks together.
 

00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:41.275
There is a very strong sense of
collegiality among lawyers,

00:39:41.275 --> 00:39:43.239
or at least supposed to be.
 

00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:46.681
The ethic of the legal
profession is very much

00:39:46.681 --> 00:39:47.829
collegiality.
 

00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:53.449
And it is also incidentally in
the universities.

00:39:53.449 --> 00:39:58.275
I mean, faculty is not supposed
to badmouth each other.

00:39:58.275 --> 00:39:58.989
Right?
 

00:39:58.989 --> 00:40:01.291
They certainly,
towards students,

00:40:01.291 --> 00:40:05.320
they have to show that they
have a collegial relationship

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.760
with each other.
 

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.030
Mutual respect binds them
together.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:13.260
Occasionally there is what he
calls veto collegiality;

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:17.943
the collegiality does give veto
right to certain people to run

00:40:17.943 --> 00:40:19.480
this organization.
 

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:25.340
A single person can veto a
decision, as such.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.916
Again, very typical in
universities when it comes,

00:40:28.916 --> 00:40:32.056
for instance,
to a decision whether somebody

00:40:32.056 --> 00:40:36.219
will be granted a permanent
position in a university;

00:40:36.219 --> 00:40:39.117
so-called tenure,
there is actually--the

00:40:39.117 --> 00:40:43.501
president of the university
usually has a veto right and can

00:40:43.501 --> 00:40:44.170
veto.
 

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:47.083
No matter that all bodies
approved that,

00:40:47.083 --> 00:40:50.967
the president usually has a
veto right--can veto that

00:40:50.967 --> 00:40:51.940
decision.
 

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:56.949
It uses it very rarely,
but occasionally it does use

00:40:56.949 --> 00:40:58.619
its veto right.
 

00:40:58.619 --> 00:41:05.766
So even in a collegially
organized bureaucracy,

00:41:05.766 --> 00:41:11.980
there is these individual veto
rights;

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.601
otherwise, collegiality usually
operates through the different

00:41:15.601 --> 00:41:17.559
committees and advisory boards.
 

00:41:17.559 --> 00:41:25.128
I mean, collegiality usually is
emerging in a situation where

00:41:25.128 --> 00:41:31.309
you have a common trade or a
common profession.

00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:36.371
That's when a group is being
organized as a collegial

00:41:36.371 --> 00:41:38.610
bureaucracy, as such.
 

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:49.762
And many of you will end up in
professions in which you will

00:41:49.762 --> 00:41:58.269
have such a collegial
environment, as such.

00:41:58.269 --> 00:42:01.809
Okay.
 

00:42:01.809 --> 00:42:05.364
The other issue is--which is
also a limitation of the

00:42:05.364 --> 00:42:09.262
functioning of the bureaucracy--
right?--collegiality

00:42:09.262 --> 00:42:13.063
meant--right?--
that though the bureaucracy is

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:17.219
supposed to be blind to
individual differences,

00:42:17.219 --> 00:42:20.746
it's not always,
because we have loyalties

00:42:20.746 --> 00:42:23.829
towards each other,
based on our profession.

00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:28.829
Lawyers are loyal to lawyers,
and doctors are loyal to fellow

00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:33.079
doctors, and professors have a
degree of loyalty.

00:42:33.079 --> 00:42:39.460
Now the other one is division
of powers.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:46.257
Well this division of powers,
what Locke and Montesquieu and

00:42:46.257 --> 00:42:51.896
Rousseau were talking about,
well it's a functional

00:42:51.896 --> 00:42:57.630
system--he cites Montesquieu
about the separation of power--

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:12.150
and that creates some degree of
unpredictability in the system;

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:15.681
but necessary,
but creates some degree of

00:43:15.681 --> 00:43:17.360
unpredictability.
 

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.523
Nevertheless,
this is the way how to prevent

00:43:20.523 --> 00:43:21.260
tyranny.
 

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.929
So therefore it is good for the
economy;

00:43:23.929 --> 00:43:26.880
by what he means for the market
economy.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.237
And then comes the question of
representations,

00:43:30.237 --> 00:43:33.230
and different forms of
representations.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:38.025
Well there are--again,
representations can be

00:43:38.025 --> 00:43:43.364
democratic, but is not
necessarily all that bloody

00:43:43.364 --> 00:43:45.000
democratic.
 

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.724
In fact, there is a possibility
of representation when the

00:43:50.724 --> 00:43:56.750
representation is happening
through some hereditary means.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:07.273
Traditional authority;
people who were born in certain

00:44:07.273 --> 00:44:10.179
positions,
like Montesquieu himself,

00:44:10.179 --> 00:44:13.949
was supposed to represent
certain interests,

00:44:13.949 --> 00:44:20.925
which is beyond the personal
interests of the person--

00:44:20.925 --> 00:44:24.126
right?;
was supposed to represent the

00:44:24.126 --> 00:44:28.090
interests of the whole estate,
what it was standing for.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:34.661
Well it's also--in modern times
we do have a representation

00:44:34.661 --> 00:44:41.460
where representations can be
selected by rotation or lot--

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:48.452
in Ancient Greece this
happened--and there can be a

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:53.779
limited mandate;
they are not representing

00:44:53.779 --> 00:45:00.411
necessarily the interest of the
constituency and they can be

00:45:00.411 --> 00:45:01.760
recalled.
 

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:06.090
This was typical of Communist
bureaucracies.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:09.670
Or there can be what he calls
free representation--

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:12.849
it's what we would associate to
democracy--

00:45:12.849 --> 00:45:15.619
where the representative is
elected,

00:45:15.619 --> 00:45:19.300
rather than selected or
appointed.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:24.380
But it is also not bound by
instructions;

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:29.679
is only obliged to express his
own conviction.

00:45:29.679 --> 00:45:34.268
So this is what we have seen in
the Congress happening.

00:45:34.268 --> 00:45:34.949
Right?
 

00:45:34.949 --> 00:45:39.311
That Democrats voted with
Republicans, because those

00:45:39.311 --> 00:45:42.904
Democrats argued,
"I'm not under party

00:45:42.904 --> 00:45:44.358
discipline."
 

00:45:44.358 --> 00:45:45.300
Right?
 

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.139
"I am acting out of my
conscience."

00:45:48.139 --> 00:45:54.128
Well a couple of ideas about
free representation,

00:45:54.128 --> 00:45:59.619
and how it goes with a
capitalist economy.

00:45:59.619 --> 00:46:03.034
Well what is
crucial--right?--and Weber keeps

00:46:03.034 --> 00:46:07.920
coming back and back to this--
what is vital for a capitalist

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.760
economy is to be calculability
and reliability.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:19.099
And well in early stages,
in fact, there was property

00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:23.384
qualification,
who could actually vote,

00:46:23.384 --> 00:46:27.780
and that was implemented in
order to make the system more

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:31.079
predictable for the propertied
classes.

00:46:31.079 --> 00:46:34.512
There was a great deal of
concern by the bourgeoisie to

00:46:34.512 --> 00:46:37.902
give universal suffrage,
because they felt then this

00:46:37.902 --> 00:46:41.690
will be unpredictable,
who will win the elections.

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:45.585
In fact, very often,
these were monarchs and

00:46:45.585 --> 00:46:49.550
absolutist monarchs,
who were pushing for

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:52.291
extension--right?--
of suffrage,

00:46:52.291 --> 00:46:56.092
because they wanted to use this
against the propertied

00:46:56.092 --> 00:46:57.170
bourgeoisie.
 

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:01.317
That's again something very
counterintuitive,

00:47:01.317 --> 00:47:06.407
but I think historically a very
accurate understanding.

00:47:06.407 --> 00:47:07.349
Right?
 

00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:12.485
So one has to be very careful
what exactly the relationship

00:47:12.485 --> 00:47:17.090
with a capitalist economic order
and democracy is.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:23.476
Well so Weber's fundamental
argument is what many people who

00:47:23.476 --> 00:47:29.429
do the history of the democratic
movement will agree;

00:47:29.429 --> 00:47:30.679
others will disagree with him.
 

00:47:30.679 --> 00:47:33.030
Again, a good subject for
discussion.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:37.717
Parliamentary free
representation was the product

00:47:37.717 --> 00:47:41.001
between struggles;
actually struggles between

00:47:41.001 --> 00:47:42.539
monarchs and the bourgeoisie.
 

00:47:42.539 --> 00:47:47.449
Well I think I'll just leave
this here.

00:47:47.449 --> 00:47:52.280
I probably gave us enough food
for the discussion.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.369
Thank you.
 

00:47:53.369 --> 00:47:58.000

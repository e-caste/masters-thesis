00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.920
Prof: I wanted to begin
with just a housekeeping item,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.700
which is that next Monday we'll
have the last class,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.654
if you want to call it that,
but it will be completely

00:00:15.654 --> 00:00:18.330
different in that it will be a
review session.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.210
I'll elaborate on what format
that might take.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.923
But essentially I'll be--there
won't be anything that I'm

00:00:26.923 --> 00:00:28.780
planning to lecture about.
 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.381
On the contrary,
it will be your opportunity to

00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:37.237
raise questions or make comments
on any aspects of the material

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:39.900
that you wish to discuss more.
 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.687
The format will be that
there'll be a microphone,

00:00:43.687 --> 00:00:47.395
and you'll come up and use it
and ask questions,

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:51.340
and then we'll discuss anything
that you wish.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.070
It will really be--I'll be in
your hands,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.584
and that will be a class that
would be helpful if you came

00:00:58.584 --> 00:01:03.494
with things that you wanted to
discuss or things that you think

00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:06.030
that we should go into more.
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.739
So, that will be what we'll do
on Monday.

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:13.173
For today, instead,
we're going to talk about

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:17.833
three,
in fact, new diseases,

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:28.409
that demonstrated once more
that the post-World War II idea,

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.208
the complacent assumption,
that modern medical science and

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:40.516
public health had the tools to
protect society and to eradicate

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:45.163
diseases one by one,
when that illusion,

00:01:45.163 --> 00:01:49.370
fostered by the example of
smallpox,

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.980
and nearly by the near
eradication of polio,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.608
was once again punctured,
as it had been earlier by the

00:01:59.608 --> 00:02:02.108
emergence of HIV/AIDS.
 

00:02:02.108 --> 00:02:06.810
Most of all it showed that our
society is still vulnerable,

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.080
particularly to respiratory
infections in the industrial

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.210
world,
transmitted by air or droplets.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.441
They're true diseases of
globalization and modernity,

00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:24.080
that thrive on high population
density and modern means of

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.438
high-speed communication.
 

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:31.180
I want to end our semester by
talking about SARS,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.413
avian flu and swine flu,
and some of the lessons we've

00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:39.870
learned from those experiences.
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.215
I would regard them as the
first new diseases of the

00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:47.531
twenty-first century,
and also as our great dress

00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:52.099
rehearsals for something much
more serious,

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.900
that may or may not come later.
 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.449
Once again, I don't want to
make a prediction.

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:03.812
So let's begin with SARS,
the first great dress rehearsal

00:03:03.812 --> 00:03:06.400
of the twentieth century.
 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.204
As you know or remember,
it began in November 2002 with

00:03:13.204 --> 00:03:20.258
an index case from someone from
the Guangdong Province in

00:03:20.258 --> 00:03:28.098
Southern China,
a severe and unusual pneumonia.

00:03:28.098 --> 00:03:34.283
What took place then in China
was not something that was

00:03:34.283 --> 00:03:39.232
extraordinary,
as our press tried to persuade

00:03:39.232 --> 00:03:40.020
us.
 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.015
Rather, it was something that's
happened many times,

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:48.169
the emergence of a new pathogen
previously unknown.

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.744
Only in the sixties and
seventies was there a boundless

00:03:52.744 --> 00:03:57.912
optimism about the capacity of
modern medicine to prevent that

00:03:57.912 --> 00:04:00.030
from happening again.
 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.360
Once again we were reminded
that the natural world isn't

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.848
static but in a state of
constant Darwinian evolution,

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:13.777
with the consequence that there
are always and inevitably new

00:04:13.777 --> 00:04:15.750
and emerging diseases.
 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.721
And viruses,
as you know,

00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:25.040
are especially capable of
sudden, rapid mutation.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.687
Well, the media did us a
disservice at the outset of SARS

00:04:31.687 --> 00:04:38.930
with sensationalizing headlines
attempting to stir up fear;

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.942
examples being,
"Is This the Big

00:04:42.942 --> 00:04:48.629
One?," "Killer
Bug," and the like.

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:55.009
The Chinese authorities,
in their response to SARS,

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.940
practiced a conspiracy of
silence at the outset,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.600
producing no reports or
statistics,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.920
and censoring the press.
 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.449
I'm hoping that this will
remind you--

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.946
what happened in China--that
also concealment isn't something

00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:16.601
we haven't encountered before,
and it will remind you of other

00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:19.560
examples of public health by
concealment.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.939
Now, why, we might speculate,
did the Chinese decide to

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:27.329
conceal this outbreak?
 

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:30.925
First, we could say,
would be the fear of economic

00:05:30.925 --> 00:05:32.100
repercussions.
 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.327
The world economy at the time
was already stagnant,

00:05:36.327 --> 00:05:40.892
and there were fears of the
implications for vulnerable

00:05:40.892 --> 00:05:44.360
sectors: travel,
tourism, investment.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.440
There was a matter of national
pride.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.425
The World Health Organization
had already produced a report

00:05:51.425 --> 00:05:53.899
ranking world healthcare
systems,

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:57.589
and China had ranked one
hundred and forty-fourth,

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:00.449
just below Bangladesh.
 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.079
So, a medical emergency could
cast a new and harsh light on

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:08.410
Chinese public health.
 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:14.141
It's also probably true that
authoritarian political systems

00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:19.387
have people who man the
apparatus, whose career depends

00:06:19.387 --> 00:06:22.009
on producing good news.
 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.440
We might also point to what we
might call an authoritarian

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.658
paternalism;
the idea of sparing the

00:06:29.658 --> 00:06:35.488
population anxiety and avoiding
giving rise to challenges to the

00:06:35.488 --> 00:06:38.079
state and its priorities.
 

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:40.620
In any case,
and whatever the reasons,

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.514
China placed the health of its
own citizens at risk by failing

00:06:45.514 --> 00:06:50.007
to enable them to make informed
decisions about their own

00:06:50.007 --> 00:06:50.889
health.
 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.232
And it took the risk also of
allowing the new disease to

00:06:55.232 --> 00:06:58.389
threaten the international
community,

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:04.144
delaying the process of patient
detective work that's required

00:07:04.144 --> 00:07:08.579
to unravel the secrets of this
new infection.

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:11.709
Finally, on the ninth of
February,

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:16.101
the Chinese Ministry of Health
notified the World Health

00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:20.495
Organization of some three
hundred and five cases in six

00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:23.449
municipalities in Southern
China.

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:26.867
This too was a serious
underestimate,

00:07:26.867 --> 00:07:32.091
and it was followed by weeks of
tardy release of dubious

00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:37.220
statistics that were meant still
to be reassuring.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:42.041
So, for weeks the World Health
Organization wasn't allowed to

00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:46.382
send teams of researchers to
investigate the disturbing

00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:47.990
events in China.
 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.747
The pathogen,
which is this one,

00:07:51.747 --> 00:07:56.839
was unknown at the time of the
outbreak;

00:07:56.839 --> 00:08:01.293
was now known to be a
previously unencountered

00:08:01.293 --> 00:08:02.680
coronavirus.
 

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:09.709
Its structure was--a schematic
picture of it would be that.

00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:13.009
Its early names--what to call
it?

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:17.291
It was called human
pneumonia-associated

00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:18.829
coronavirus.
 

00:08:18.829 --> 00:08:23.505
Because of one of its early
victims, it was called the

00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:24.829
Urbani virus.
 

00:08:24.829 --> 00:08:31.509
But the name that stuck was
SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:32.798
Syndrome.
 

00:08:32.798 --> 00:08:36.062
Let's follow our usual
procedure and look at the

00:08:36.062 --> 00:08:39.948
symptoms and the epidemiology,
and some of the effects on

00:08:39.948 --> 00:08:42.240
society of the SARS outbreak.
 

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.322
In terms of symptoms,
the disease was first

00:08:46.322 --> 00:08:50.990
identified and defined by
Dr. Carlo Urbani,

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.990
a forty-six-year-old infectious
disease expert for the WHO,

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.566
who was working at Hanoi,
and was one of the early

00:08:59.566 --> 00:09:02.340
physicians to encounter the
disease.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.908
He contracted it and died soon
after.

00:09:06.908 --> 00:09:10.950
The symptoms were an incubation
period of about a week--

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.681
five to ten days or
so--followed by a sudden onset

00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:19.010
of fever--
about a hundred degrees,

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.269
a hundred and one-general
malaise,

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:26.600
headache, muscle pain,
dizziness, sore throat.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.638
Three to seven days later the
majority of cases improved

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:37.470
spontaneously,
with no lasting ill effect.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.548
But a minority of cases
worsened at that very point,

00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:44.700
with lower respiratory
involvement,

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.600
and this led to a hacking,
non-productive cough,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.879
terrible shortness of breath
and chest pain.

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:58.779
It's worth remembering that the
disease at this stage was

00:09:58.779 --> 00:10:00.450
thoroughly unpleasant.
 

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.220
A Toronto nurse,
suffering from SARS,

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.759
was interviewed by phone from
her hospital room,

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:11.489
and she said that the cough she
was experiencing was so violent

00:10:11.489 --> 00:10:15.947
that she turned blue,
and it caused her to fall to

00:10:15.947 --> 00:10:16.980
her knees.
 

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.807
In a minority of cases there
was a progress to very severe

00:10:21.807 --> 00:10:26.212
respiratory distress,
requiring oxygen and mechanical

00:10:26.212 --> 00:10:27.230
support.
 

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:31.710
X-rays revealed what was called
atypical pneumonia,

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.538
which was a somewhat confusing
term because it had been used,

00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:40.779
until that time,
for a different condition.

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:45.719
On the seventh of May 2003,
the World Health Organization

00:10:45.719 --> 00:10:51.011
suggested that SARS had a case
fatality rate of about fifteen

00:10:51.011 --> 00:10:52.600
percent or so.
 

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.298
There was no known specific
treatment,

00:10:56.298 --> 00:11:00.927
and patients were given
broad-spectrum antibiotics and

00:11:00.927 --> 00:11:03.851
antivirals,
but they weren't very

00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:07.904
effective, and treatment was
really symptomatic and

00:11:07.904 --> 00:11:09.039
supportive.
 

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:11.450
What about transmission?
 

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.563
The dominant mode for
transmitting SARS was clearly

00:11:15.563 --> 00:11:20.095
face-to-face contact,
droplets from coughing or

00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:23.567
sneezing,
and the droplets that were

00:11:23.567 --> 00:11:27.178
inhaled were the contaminated
objects--

00:11:27.178 --> 00:11:34.222
that is, fomites--and a person
touching them and then bringing

00:11:34.222 --> 00:11:39.649
the hand to the mouth could
ingest the virus.

00:11:39.649 --> 00:11:44.057
This mode of transmission was
encouraging for public health

00:11:44.057 --> 00:11:47.932
because it meant that the
disease required prolonged

00:11:47.932 --> 00:11:52.101
contact at close range,
and was much less contagious

00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:57.529
than say the Spanish influenza,
smallpox or pneumonic plague.

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:02.336
And the dominant pattern of the
epidemic was for SARS to spread

00:12:02.336 --> 00:12:06.870
in tight clusters of people,
closely gathered around a

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:11.222
patient: healthcare personnel,
their family members,

00:12:11.222 --> 00:12:15.113
hospital visitors,
guests on the same floor of a

00:12:15.113 --> 00:12:18.427
hotel,
or residents of the same wing

00:12:18.427 --> 00:12:21.278
of an urban tenement dwelling.
 

00:12:21.278 --> 00:12:25.480
And the disease,
like airborne viral infections

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.544
in general,
seems to be an equal

00:12:28.544 --> 00:12:34.350
opportunity affliction that can
pass to all classes of society,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.412
the young, the old,
the healthy and those with

00:12:38.412 --> 00:12:40.668
preexisting conditions.
 

00:12:40.668 --> 00:12:44.519
But there also was some
evidence, although it mostly

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:48.220
remained confined to the
hospital environment,

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.970
at least outside of China,
it could spread to communities.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.735
There were speculations during
the outbreak of people who were

00:12:56.735 --> 00:13:01.375
called super-spreaders--
sort of viral Typhoid Marys,

00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:06.001
was the image--
who were unusually virulent and

00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:10.480
who shed viruses inhaled at a
greater distance;

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.100
perhaps through the
air-conditioning system of a

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.720
hotel, or the circulating air of
an airplane.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.716
There was speculation that
sometimes it could spread

00:13:21.716 --> 00:13:25.791
through the fecal-oral route,
or through asymptomatic

00:13:25.791 --> 00:13:26.808
carriers.
 

00:13:26.808 --> 00:13:30.727
In any case,
the disease spread from

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:36.660
Southern China and Guangdong
Dong Province to its next

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:42.399
epicenter, which was Hong Kong;
which was particularly

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:47.529
important because of population
density and mass air travel,

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:53.259
Hong Kong being one of the
great hubs of the international

00:13:53.259 --> 00:13:55.370
air travel network.
 

00:13:55.370 --> 00:14:00.734
It's important noting too that
Hong Kong had intense,

00:14:00.734 --> 00:14:05.788
constant links with neighboring
southern China.

00:14:05.788 --> 00:14:10.110
In sheer size it had some 6
million people and was known as

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.908
one of the most densely crowded
cities on earth,

00:14:13.908 --> 00:14:18.740
and possessed the busiest
airport in Asia.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:24.825
The first outbreak was at the
Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong,

00:14:24.825 --> 00:14:30.176
and then very rapidly
thereafter the Prince of Wales

00:14:30.176 --> 00:14:31.538
Hospital.
 

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:35.720
The disease,
at the initial cases,

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.452
wasn't really recognized and no
special precautionary measures

00:14:40.452 --> 00:14:43.702
were taken,
though the hospital and the

00:14:43.702 --> 00:14:48.505
hotel soon became world famous
as the first foci of infection

00:14:48.505 --> 00:14:51.548
outside of Guangdong Dong
Province.

00:14:51.548 --> 00:14:55.182
The people afflicted early on
were doctors,

00:14:55.182 --> 00:14:59.249
nurses, orderlies,
attendants, hospital visitors

00:14:59.249 --> 00:15:02.710
and a couple of guests at the
hotel.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:07.322
So, Hong Kong became the second
world epicenter,

00:15:07.322 --> 00:15:12.918
and the disease spread from
there, using air travel as its

00:15:12.918 --> 00:15:13.899
means.
 

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:17.418
It went to three places
particularly.

00:15:17.418 --> 00:15:24.452
First was to Hanoi in Vietnam,
then to Singapore,

00:15:24.452 --> 00:15:30.899
and then on to this continent,
to Toronto.

00:15:30.899 --> 00:15:36.116
It struck Toronto through a
seventy-eight-year-old immigrant

00:15:36.116 --> 00:15:41.070
from Hong Kong who'd been
staying at the Metropole Hotel,

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.899
before returning to Toronto.
 

00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:50.500
She was hospitalized and died
in the Scarborough Hospital in

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.620
Toronto.
 

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:56.808
There was soon a joke about
SARS;

00:15:56.808 --> 00:16:00.024
that is to say,
"Are you worried about

00:16:00.024 --> 00:16:01.480
terrorists?"
 

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.629
"No, we're worried about
Canadians."

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:08.947
In any case,
what were the public health

00:16:08.947 --> 00:16:12.158
measures that were adopted?
 

00:16:12.158 --> 00:16:16.783
The first thing to note is
that--I've said this was a great

00:16:16.783 --> 00:16:20.211
dress-rehearsal,
and it was a transformative

00:16:20.211 --> 00:16:23.187
event;
although we're going to see

00:16:23.187 --> 00:16:27.461
that all of these three
pandemics that we discuss this

00:16:27.461 --> 00:16:32.379
morning were relatively limited
in terms of their impact,

00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:37.325
they are really important for
our consideration because they

00:16:37.325 --> 00:16:40.509
mark a real change in public
health.

00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:46.063
One of the factors was that
SARS led to an unprecedented

00:16:46.063 --> 00:16:51.720
coordination of international
public health responses.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.350
What happened was really
extraordinary,

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.450
as Julie Gerberding,
the director of the CDC,

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.195
pointed out,
saying that this was "a

00:17:01.195 --> 00:17:04.490
monumental international
transformation."

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.584
What happened on the twelfth of
March, the World Health

00:17:08.584 --> 00:17:11.390
Organization issued a global
alert;

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.368
by the fifteenth,
a travel advisory;

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:18.747
and thereafter some eleven
laboratories in nineteen

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:22.250
countries were linked
electronically,

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.049
as they shared all information
in real time,

00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:28.288
hunting for the pathogen.
 

00:17:28.288 --> 00:17:33.443
They began genetic sequencing,
and began work attempting to

00:17:33.443 --> 00:17:37.710
find a vaccine and a reliable
diagnostic test.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:42.308
The result was success in world
record time.

00:17:42.308 --> 00:17:46.161
On April 16^(th),
the World Health Organization

00:17:46.161 --> 00:17:50.682
Laboratory Network announced
that it had identified the

00:17:50.682 --> 00:17:53.529
pathogen responsible for SARS.
 

00:17:53.529 --> 00:17:59.056
By the twenty-sixth of March,
there was the beginning of

00:17:59.056 --> 00:18:03.904
electronic grand rounds,
in which the internet was used

00:18:03.904 --> 00:18:07.323
to bring together eighty
clinicians from thirteen

00:18:07.323 --> 00:18:10.589
countries,
to share information on the

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:13.869
care and maintenance of SARS
patients.

00:18:13.869 --> 00:18:17.118
Those were novel features.
 

00:18:17.118 --> 00:18:19.644
In addition,
there were some traditional

00:18:19.644 --> 00:18:22.884
measures that were taken,
that constitute in part a

00:18:22.884 --> 00:18:26.769
review of things that you're
already well familiar with.

00:18:26.769 --> 00:18:30.595
A team of World Health
Organization epidemiologists

00:18:30.595 --> 00:18:34.955
began investigating the epidemic
in Southern China and its

00:18:34.955 --> 00:18:36.410
outward spread.
 

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:41.078
Some airports began to
quarantine people who arrived.

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:46.040
They took their temperatures,
examined them for symptoms,

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:51.179
and gave them advisory cards
with information on what to do

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:53.038
if they fell ill.
 

00:18:53.038 --> 00:18:57.327
Hospitals set up isolation
wards, with a capacity to

00:18:57.327 --> 00:19:01.022
contain air,
and with barrier protection for

00:19:01.022 --> 00:19:03.769
hospital personnel:
double gowns,

00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:08.140
facemasks, goggles,
gloves, hand disinfection,

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.858
changes of shoes.
 

00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:14.797
In affected areas,
there was the rigorous tracking

00:19:14.797 --> 00:19:17.450
of all contacts of known cases.
 

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.726
There was quarantine,
in some places,

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:24.182
even house arrests,
with video cameras,

00:19:24.182 --> 00:19:28.096
unannounced police visits,
sanctions, fines,

00:19:28.096 --> 00:19:30.190
and all the rest.
 

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.606
And you might like to know that
the Toronto Star also

00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:38.798
recommended reading material for
those in quarantine,

00:19:38.798 --> 00:19:42.986
and it looked a little bit like
something that might be a

00:19:42.986 --> 00:19:45.230
reading list for our course.
 

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.803
That is, the most popular book
for the SARS patients,

00:19:48.803 --> 00:19:51.826
you'll all be glad to know,
was Daniel Defoe,

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:54.298
Journal of a Plague
Year.

00:19:54.298 --> 00:20:00.425
And they also read Camus and
Boccaccio, in their quarantine

00:20:00.425 --> 00:20:01.798
in Toronto.
 

00:20:01.798 --> 00:20:06.020
There was public information in
the media and on the web,

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.470
enabling citizens to make
rational public health choices.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:14.556
There was compulsory masking,
the closing of schools,

00:20:14.556 --> 00:20:19.115
cancellation of sports events
and other large gatherings of

00:20:19.115 --> 00:20:19.980
people.
 

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.750
All of those were measures that
were fairly traditional.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.240
So, what's striking is a kind
of contrast.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.156
On the one hand,
the high-tech end,

00:20:30.156 --> 00:20:34.275
working out the biology and
epidemiology of SARS,

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:38.394
with extraordinary rapid,
efficient and high-tech

00:20:38.394 --> 00:20:40.108
interventions.
 

00:20:40.108 --> 00:20:43.657
On the other hand,
public health measures and

00:20:43.657 --> 00:20:46.480
treatment were rather
old-fashioned,

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.818
low-tech and traditional.
 

00:20:48.818 --> 00:20:53.568
But the public health measures
were effective.

00:20:53.568 --> 00:20:58.124
By mid-May there were signs
that the outbreaks were

00:20:58.124 --> 00:21:02.222
retreating and being
successfully contained in

00:21:02.222 --> 00:21:04.410
healthcare settings.
 

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:08.511
By June 18^(th),
as the global epidemic reached

00:21:08.511 --> 00:21:12.881
its hundredth day,
the number of cases was down to

00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:14.130
a handful.
 

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:18.540
On the fifth of July,
the World Health Organization

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:23.130
announced that SARS had been
controlled worldwide.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:28.566
The total, by the end,
was something like 8,000 cases

00:21:28.566 --> 00:21:31.390
and a few hundred deaths.
 

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.094
Nonetheless,
the passage of this marked a

00:21:35.094 --> 00:21:38.982
transformation,
as I said, in international

00:21:38.982 --> 00:21:42.410
public health
interconnectedness.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:47.029
It also left behind it
important effects on

00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:48.568
communities.
 

00:21:48.568 --> 00:21:52.490
Hong Kong was described as a
ghost town.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.721
Its shops, restaurants,
theaters, churches,

00:21:55.721 --> 00:22:00.338
public health transport were
all deserted and many closed.

00:22:00.338 --> 00:22:05.012
Communion wasn't administered
in churches, and daily life was

00:22:05.012 --> 00:22:09.219
transformed for those in
quarantine, and for healthcare

00:22:09.219 --> 00:22:10.308
personnel.
 

00:22:10.308 --> 00:22:14.738
A joke circulated in Hong Kong
that if you wanted space to

00:22:14.738 --> 00:22:19.554
yourself, all you had to do was
sneeze and you'd immediately be

00:22:19.554 --> 00:22:20.720
left alone.
 

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.834
There was economic impact,
the collapse of tourism and the

00:22:25.834 --> 00:22:27.450
retail industry.
 

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:32.898
One estimate was that some ten
billion dollars were lost in

00:22:32.898 --> 00:22:36.470
Asia because of the impact of
SARS,

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:40.622
with knock-on effects on
unemployment and fragile

00:22:40.622 --> 00:22:42.180
economic growth.
 

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:46.382
Toronto, this epicenter in
North America,

00:22:46.382 --> 00:22:49.430
was less severely affected.
 

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:53.483
But there were things there too
that remind us of parts of our

00:22:53.483 --> 00:22:56.009
course, that you now know very
well.

00:22:56.009 --> 00:23:01.223
There were reports in the city
that it was being seized by a

00:23:01.223 --> 00:23:06.440
SARS panic, a stigmatization of
victims and scapegoating.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.769
A nurse, who had been
hospitalized and later

00:23:09.769 --> 00:23:13.642
interviewed in the press,
reported that a crowd had

00:23:13.642 --> 00:23:17.048
gathered outside her home and
stoned it.

00:23:17.048 --> 00:23:21.455
There was, in the Canadian
press, a series of reports on

00:23:21.455 --> 00:23:26.067
what was called SARS racism,
particularly in Chinatown,

00:23:26.067 --> 00:23:30.490
and children of Asian origin
were bullied in school,

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:35.029
and Asian Canadians were
shunned in public.

00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:39.259
Toronto also spawned reports of
a general fear.

00:23:39.259 --> 00:23:44.006
Polls show that sixty percent
of Canadians were worried or

00:23:44.006 --> 00:23:47.170
very worried about contracting
SARS.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:51.602
And even places not touched by
the disease experienced some

00:23:51.602 --> 00:23:53.358
ripple shock effects.
 

00:23:53.358 --> 00:23:58.000
Los Angeles and San Francisco
had--people reported that

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.009
surgical masks had been sold
out.

00:24:01.009 --> 00:24:05.469
ERs and primary care physicians
were overwhelmed with people

00:24:05.469 --> 00:24:08.038
with coughs and the common cold.
 

00:24:08.038 --> 00:24:11.868
Chinese restaurants and
Chinatowns in the United Sates,

00:24:11.868 --> 00:24:14.462
in various cities,
were deserted,

00:24:14.462 --> 00:24:18.921
and Health Canada reported an
outbreak of what it termed

00:24:18.921 --> 00:24:23.460
"SARS racism against the
Asian community."

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:28.436
So, the experience of SARS was
the first dress rehearsal of the

00:24:28.436 --> 00:24:32.048
twenty-first century for
emerging diseases.

00:24:32.048 --> 00:24:36.792
And I think it showed that the
world community was still

00:24:36.792 --> 00:24:40.759
vulnerable, especially to
airborne diseases.

00:24:40.759 --> 00:24:44.952
SARS tested the preparedness of
public health and the

00:24:44.952 --> 00:24:48.180
preparedness of political
authorities.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:52.317
On the positive side,
it revealed and stimulated an

00:24:52.317 --> 00:24:56.538
extraordinary technical and
scientific capacity,

00:24:56.538 --> 00:25:01.338
in interlocking laboratories
that identified the pathogen,

00:25:01.338 --> 00:25:04.910
and in the ground rounds in
cyberspace.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:09.182
But I would argue that there
wasn't really room for

00:25:09.182 --> 00:25:10.380
complacency.
 

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:14.384
The world was lucky and dodged
a bullet with SARS,

00:25:14.384 --> 00:25:17.980
for a variety of fortuitous
circumstances.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:23.123
The disease spread by droplets
isn't really very readily

00:25:23.123 --> 00:25:24.619
transmissible.
 

00:25:24.619 --> 00:25:27.220
The chronology was fortunate.
 

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.920
The disease began to spread
globally in the spring;

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.559
which, as you know,
is normally the beginning of

00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:36.730
the end of the flu season.
 

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.380
And there was serendipity.
 

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:44.058
The disease spread to Hong
Kong, Singapore and Toronto,

00:25:44.058 --> 00:25:48.119
and those are all places of
highly developed healthcare

00:25:48.119 --> 00:25:52.029
systems and resources making
containment possible.

00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:55.624
One wonders what the result
might have been had the earlier

00:25:55.624 --> 00:25:58.080
travelers,
who spread SARS,

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:04.067
gone to different destinations
in resource-poor Third World

00:26:04.067 --> 00:26:05.098
cities.
 

00:26:05.098 --> 00:26:08.730
So, that was the first dress
rehearsal.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:13.736
The second followed fairly
quickly after,

00:26:13.736 --> 00:26:20.371
and this was avian influenza,
H5N1, which was a new or

00:26:20.371 --> 00:26:23.250
emerging epizootic.
 

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:29.730
It was first isolated in 1996,
but began as a disease of

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:34.680
waterfowl in Southeast Asia in
mid-2003.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.910
Early cases were mostly
undetected and unreported.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:46.086
There then followed three small
waves of this influenza

00:26:46.086 --> 00:26:50.093
outbreak,
beginning in December

00:26:50.093 --> 00:26:55.492
2003/January 2004 in Korea,
Vietnam, Japan,

00:26:55.492 --> 00:27:01.019
Cambodia, Indonesia,
first among susceptible birds.

00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:05.614
It spread rapidly and affected
their internal organs with a

00:27:05.614 --> 00:27:09.180
mortality rate of nearly a
hundred percent.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.469
And this was one of the great
global epizootics,

00:27:13.469 --> 00:27:17.848
with tens of millions of wild
birds perishing.

00:27:17.848 --> 00:27:23.323
Then H5N1 demonstrated that it
was capable of transmission to

00:27:23.323 --> 00:27:28.432
human beings who came into
contact with infected poultry:

00:27:28.432 --> 00:27:32.614
butchers,
people who raised live poultry

00:27:32.614 --> 00:27:36.098
or live in close contact with
them.

00:27:36.098 --> 00:27:43.397
This is--that's the masking
from SARS, but I wanted to show

00:27:43.397 --> 00:27:50.318
you someone at risk during the
epidemic of avian flu.

00:27:50.318 --> 00:27:57.246
Then there were human cases
that began a second detected

00:27:57.246 --> 00:28:04.548
wave in June and July 2004 that
ended in November 2004,

00:28:04.548 --> 00:28:08.630
and a third wave beginning in
December of 2004,

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.960
again in Southeast Asia.
 

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:19.143
Once again, if we look at--I
wanted to show you a few cases

00:28:19.143 --> 00:28:23.848
of humor generated by the avian
flu.

00:28:23.848 --> 00:28:28.521
Here we see a person saying
that they're safe at last,

00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:31.519
but in fact they weren't
really.

00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:34.894
Then there's this one,
which might take you a second

00:28:34.894 --> 00:28:38.269
to see what's happened to our
friend Donald Duck.

00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:44.133
I think it's worth knowing that
epidemic diseases sometimes also

00:28:44.133 --> 00:28:46.740
generate a human response.
 

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.583
And then there's this one,
that I was particularly fond

00:28:50.583 --> 00:28:54.967
of,
which is your flock of geese

00:28:54.967 --> 00:28:59.356
and of poultry,
with one sneezing in the back,

00:28:59.356 --> 00:29:01.609
and someone in the front
saying,

00:29:01.609 --> 00:29:03.700
"Very funny."
 

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.847
In any case,
the spread was by migratory

00:29:07.847 --> 00:29:12.457
birds in flight,
but also by the great trade

00:29:12.457 --> 00:29:17.531
routes of the poultry industry,
the trade in chickens,

00:29:17.531 --> 00:29:21.479
in feathers,
in chicken parts for use as

00:29:21.479 --> 00:29:26.230
feed, chicken excrement for use
as fertilizer.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:31.221
Once again, the world was
fortunate in that avian flu

00:29:31.221 --> 00:29:35.348
didn't spread readily among
human beings.

00:29:35.348 --> 00:29:42.278
We then experienced our third
rehearsal for the twenty-first

00:29:42.278 --> 00:29:48.502
century, and this was swine flu,
that all of you know,

00:29:48.502 --> 00:29:49.558
H1N1.
 

00:29:49.558 --> 00:29:55.400
It first appeared in Mexico in
March/April of 2009,

00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:00.961
as far as is known,
then swept the globe and isn't

00:30:00.961 --> 00:30:04.592
in fact--
hasn't entirely ebbed,

00:30:04.592 --> 00:30:07.298
as we meet this morning.
 

00:30:07.298 --> 00:30:11.105
Thus far, however,
apart from the early phase of

00:30:11.105 --> 00:30:16.960
the disease in Mexico,
where it was fairly--it was

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:22.729
fairly serious in Mexico--
it's been elsewhere a

00:30:22.729 --> 00:30:26.240
widespread, relatively mild
disease,

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.000
that's infected millions and
millions of people,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.170
but with a strictly limited
mortality;

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:37.930
a mortality less even than
seasonal influenza.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:44.476
But we need to remember that we
don't know the end of this story

00:30:44.476 --> 00:30:45.098
yet.
 

00:30:45.098 --> 00:30:50.017
Viruses for influenza are
highly unstable and capable of

00:30:50.017 --> 00:30:54.307
mutating, and so it could
achieve still a greater

00:30:54.307 --> 00:30:55.558
virulence.
 

00:30:55.558 --> 00:31:00.055
And we know from previous
outbreaks of influenza that it

00:31:00.055 --> 00:31:02.588
could return in future waves.
 

00:31:02.588 --> 00:31:07.297
Often a pattern of influenza
outbreaks has been to have a

00:31:07.297 --> 00:31:08.808
series of waves.
 

00:31:08.808 --> 00:31:13.528
We don't know what will happen
with the swine flu.

00:31:13.528 --> 00:31:15.588
This was the first epidemic
disease,

00:31:15.588 --> 00:31:20.545
however--and this was a major
transformation in public

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:23.826
health--
to appear after the entry into

00:31:23.826 --> 00:31:28.596
force of the new international
health regulations of 2005 that

00:31:28.596 --> 00:31:32.900
were signed by one hundred and
ninety four nations,

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:37.098
including all members of the
World Health Organization.

00:31:37.098 --> 00:31:41.557
Those regulations were intended
to provide rapid international

00:31:41.557 --> 00:31:44.190
response to public health
threats.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:48.636
And in particular the old
regulations had declared that

00:31:48.636 --> 00:31:53.166
there needed to be reporting
only for diseases that were

00:31:53.166 --> 00:31:54.650
already known.
 

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:59.847
It seemed to assume a static
world, without the emergence of

00:31:59.847 --> 00:32:01.170
new diseases.
 

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:05.914
The new regulations took that
into account and called for

00:32:05.914 --> 00:32:09.390
compulsory reporting of disease
events;

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:15.670
of known diseases but also new
ones, new public health threats.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:19.490
The new regulations then
required reporting.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:24.263
They standardized and improved
international surveillance,

00:32:24.263 --> 00:32:28.788
and they allowed World Health
Organization intervention

00:32:28.788 --> 00:32:31.720
through regularized procedures.
 

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.436
And they played,
the new regulations,

00:32:34.436 --> 00:32:37.910
an important role in the
unfolding pandemic.

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:42.708
Indeed, the coordination of the
international response to swine

00:32:42.708 --> 00:32:44.428
flu,
at every level,

00:32:44.428 --> 00:32:48.907
was one of the most encouraging
lessons of this particular

00:32:48.907 --> 00:32:52.137
pandemic,
along with the speed with which

00:32:52.137 --> 00:32:55.130
a vaccine was developed and
distributed,

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.140
along with antiviral
medications.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.557
But once again,
there was no real place for

00:33:02.557 --> 00:33:04.028
complacency.
 

00:33:04.028 --> 00:33:09.050
It was true--and this was a
worrying sign--that the disease

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:13.640
took the world public health
community by surprise.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:18.541
The ruling dogma in matters of
influenza was that the next

00:33:18.541 --> 00:33:23.444
threat would emerge in the Far
East, and it was there that

00:33:23.444 --> 00:33:26.368
surveillance was concentrated.
 

00:33:26.368 --> 00:33:30.936
But this was a pandemic that
surprised everyone by breaking

00:33:30.936 --> 00:33:35.493
out first of all in Mexico,
and it did so at a time that no

00:33:35.493 --> 00:33:38.971
one was expecting,
in the spring rather than in

00:33:38.971 --> 00:33:44.940
the early fall or winter,
as influenza normally does.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:50.973
The crisis also exposed a lack
of capacity in the public health

00:33:50.973 --> 00:33:56.618
system, limited surge capacity
in terms of hospital beds or

00:33:56.618 --> 00:33:58.078
caregivers.
 

00:33:58.078 --> 00:34:03.011
There was an ongoing public
distrust of vaccination as

00:34:03.011 --> 00:34:05.058
something dangerous.
 

00:34:05.058 --> 00:34:10.255
It also showed the capacity of
airborne respiratory disease to

00:34:10.255 --> 00:34:14.409
emerge without warning,
and to spread rapidly across

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:17.295
the globe,
before vaccines could be

00:34:17.295 --> 00:34:19.610
developed to contain them.
 

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.340
And as in the case of SARS and
avian flu,

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:29.690
so too H1H1 showed that the
world community was fortunate,

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:35.226
because this turned out really
to be a dress rehearsal in that

00:34:35.226 --> 00:34:39.219
the pathogen had a very limited
virulence.

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:44.289
So, as a society,
how prepared were we?

00:34:44.289 --> 00:34:50.034
Once a pandemic strain
appeared, it took quite a bit of

00:34:50.034 --> 00:34:50.780
time.
 

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:56.137
I think we should say that
neither doomsday pessimism nor

00:34:56.137 --> 00:34:58.719
complacency are rational.
 

00:34:58.719 --> 00:35:00.539
The threat is real.
 

00:35:00.539 --> 00:35:06.264
But pessimism is also
unrealistic, and there are many

00:35:06.264 --> 00:35:11.768
steps that could be taken to
contain the threat.

00:35:11.768 --> 00:35:18.246
The SARS lesson showed us that
virologists can now be instantly

00:35:18.246 --> 00:35:22.320
linked via the web around the
globe,

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.606
and that clinicians can
exchange information on patient

00:35:26.606 --> 00:35:28.670
care in the same manner.
 

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:33.034
SARS was epoch-making in this
organized response,

00:35:33.034 --> 00:35:37.581
and this process was
strengthened through avian flu

00:35:37.581 --> 00:35:39.219
and swine flu.
 

00:35:39.219 --> 00:35:41.570
Especially important,
as I've said,

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:46.425
was the entry into force of the
new set of international health

00:35:46.425 --> 00:35:51.050
regulations,
and individual communities and

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:56.570
countries now put into place
advance planning,

00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:02.000
after SARS, with procedures
before the next emergency.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.715
Globalization,
in other words,

00:36:04.715 --> 00:36:09.400
was not only a health risk,
but also a resource.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:14.179
And you can see the difference
right here on our campus.

00:36:14.179 --> 00:36:20.228
SARS, I would argue,
caught Yale unprepared,

00:36:20.228 --> 00:36:26.840
and the result was confusion,
fear and delay.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.730
By the time of the swine flu
outbreak,

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:33.219
however, the lesson had been
learned,

00:36:33.219 --> 00:36:38.695
and it was very impressive to
note that this time around there

00:36:38.695 --> 00:36:43.679
was a coherent strategy;
that everyone was kept informed

00:36:43.679 --> 00:36:46.500
throughout the course of events.
 

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.380
And perhaps the only worrying
aspect was something that wasn't

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:55.539
our community's fault but a
sobering global issue.

00:36:55.539 --> 00:36:58.590
It was worth remembering that
last fall,

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.730
at the height of the swine
outbreak,

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:06.878
vaccines arrived just as the
disease was moving on from the

00:37:06.878 --> 00:37:08.920
State of Connecticut.
 

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:13.101
In any case,
in the absence of an effective

00:37:13.101 --> 00:37:18.365
therapy or prophylactic,
for patients supportive care

00:37:18.365 --> 00:37:22.139
and nursing are crucial
considerations,

00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:26.655
and one could argue that
perhaps for-profit medicine has

00:37:26.655 --> 00:37:30.679
squeezed the surge capacity out
of our system,

00:37:30.679 --> 00:37:36.829
and radically reduced the ratio
of nurses to patients.

00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:40.233
There was also a crucially
important factor,

00:37:40.233 --> 00:37:43.559
which was the race to develop a
vaccine.

00:37:43.559 --> 00:37:47.369
And here, to cultivate the
virus--in the case,

00:37:47.369 --> 00:37:51.329
for example,
of SARS--massive numbers of--

00:37:51.329 --> 00:37:55.436
or avian flu--what was
discovered was the need for

00:37:55.436 --> 00:37:57.949
massive numbers of hen eggs.
 

00:37:57.949 --> 00:38:01.293
And, so, the poultry industry
should perhaps have been

00:38:01.293 --> 00:38:05.286
declared of crucial importance,
because the hens themselves

00:38:05.286 --> 00:38:10.338
were needed for the vaccine,
but would perish in crippling

00:38:10.338 --> 00:38:15.820
numbers in the event of the
avian flu going further.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:21.079
Communities also learned that
they could plan their response

00:38:21.079 --> 00:38:24.563
in advance;
that they could take measures

00:38:24.563 --> 00:38:28.329
to educate about
coughing/sneezing etiquette,

00:38:28.329 --> 00:38:31.860
hand sanitizing,
the danger of fomites,

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:36.391
the utility of masking,
and the utility of avoiding

00:38:36.391 --> 00:38:40.400
assemblies of people and,
as far as possible,

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.809
to isolate themselves during
the outbreak,

00:38:43.809 --> 00:38:47.779
and the importance of
information to prevent the

00:38:47.779 --> 00:38:49.300
spread of panic.
 

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:55.980
So, I would argue that these
three dress-rehearsals,

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.768
for the twenty-first century,
had major--

00:38:59.768 --> 00:39:04.987
although all three were in
terms of their impact as

00:39:04.987 --> 00:39:08.610
diseases,
they were very limited.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:11.699
The world was fortunate in that
respect.

00:39:11.699 --> 00:39:15.313
They revealed important
vulnerabilities,

00:39:15.313 --> 00:39:20.873
but they also provoked a new
organization of response through

00:39:20.873 --> 00:39:24.414
laboratories;
a new coordination of the

00:39:24.414 --> 00:39:29.744
public health community;
new awareness of the need

00:39:29.744 --> 00:39:36.070
rapidly to distribute antivirals
and vaccines;

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:41.661
and they taught the necessity
of preparation in advance for

00:39:41.661 --> 00:39:43.590
the next outbreak.
 

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:49.362
I would say that the world
moved on enormously as a result

00:39:49.362 --> 00:39:53.210
of SARS, of avian flu and swine
flu.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:58.858
But I would argue that emerging
diseases are an inherent part of

00:39:58.858 --> 00:40:03.251
the human condition,
nothing totally to be thought

00:40:03.251 --> 00:40:06.119
of as unexpected or strange.
 

00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:09.929
And if I were to make just one
prediction,

00:40:09.929 --> 00:40:12.739
I would expect that there would
be more,

00:40:12.739 --> 00:40:17.170
and that the systems set in
place and improved by SARS,

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:24.030
avian flu and swine flu will be
tested again in our new century.

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:25.909
And with that I'll stop.
 

00:40:25.909 --> 00:40:30.483
And we'll gather again on
Monday for a review session of

00:40:30.483 --> 00:40:34.309
everything that we've covered in
our course.

00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:38.472
So, the review should include
everything from the beginning,

00:40:38.472 --> 00:40:40.449
down through the very end.
 

00:40:40.449 --> 00:40:44.434
It's not meant to be limited
just to the first half,

00:40:44.434 --> 00:40:47.170
but to the whole of the
semester.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:52.000

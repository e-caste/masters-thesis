00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.745
Prof: Our topic this
morning is influenza,

00:00:06.745 --> 00:00:09.770
which is timely for today.
 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.906
And I'd like to begin by
talking about influenza virus

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:17.403
more in general,
and we'll concentrate our

00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:20.227
attention,
for obvious reasons,

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:25.336
on the Spanish Lady,
the great influenza of

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:26.870
1918,1919.
 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.840
Now, influenza virus was
isolated in the 1930s by

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.329
Andrews, Wilson and Laidlaw,
and the mechanisms of the

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.990
disease were then unraveled
subsequently.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.668
As you know,
there are three types,

00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:49.158
A, B and C, and it's A virus
that's the cause of pandemics

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:50.970
among human beings.
 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.210
In terms of the structure of
the virus,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.670
as you know,
it's RNA, wrapped in a protein

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.685
envelope,
with protein spikes on the

00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:09.427
surface--
you can see them--and the

00:01:09.427 --> 00:01:16.566
spikes are of two major types:
hemagglutinin and

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.150
neuraminidase.
 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.754
The hemagglutinin enables the
virus to attach itself to a host

00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:27.938
cell,
in this case in the respiratory

00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:31.060
tract,
and it's neuraminidase that

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.209
enables the fusion of the virus
with cells,

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:40.173
so that the viral RNA can be
released into the cell's

00:01:40.173 --> 00:01:44.849
cytoplasm and then migrate to
the cell nucleus.

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.626
The hemagglutinin and
neuraminidase have various

00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:53.406
strains that have been numbered,
and you have on your handout

00:01:53.406 --> 00:01:57.129
those that have been identified
for the nineteenth,

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:59.519
twentieth and twenty-first
century.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:04.248
And everyone knows now H1N1,
the swine virus that's

00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:06.140
currently with us.
 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.159
And I'm sorry on the handout
that I've got 2010;

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.658
I meant to have 2009 to 2011.
 

00:02:13.658 --> 00:02:17.546
So, if you could make that
correction, that would make me

00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:18.449
feel happy.
 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:25.200
The viral RNA then hijacks the
cell and transforms it into a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.121
viral factory for the
reproduction of virus,

00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:35.500
and it eventually destroys the
cell itself.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.889
This process of reproduction is
extraordinarily efficient,

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.855
and nearly instantaneous,
so that the idea of measuring

00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:49.639
generations of viruses begins to
lose all meaning.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.620
We also need to point out,
about influenza virus,

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.440
that the RNA combines in all
sorts of ways,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.069
making a genetic characteristic
of extreme instability,

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.908
or should we say mutability.
 

00:03:06.908 --> 00:03:10.427
The processes involved,
that you can study up on

00:03:10.427 --> 00:03:15.955
Science Hill in more detail,
involve things called antigen

00:03:15.955 --> 00:03:18.438
drift,
antigen shift,

00:03:18.438 --> 00:03:24.143
mutation, hybridization,
giving rise to subtypes,

00:03:24.143 --> 00:03:26.650
strains and variants.
 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.935
All of these changes are part
of the success story of

00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:36.813
influenza as a disease,
and there is no crossover

00:03:36.813 --> 00:03:40.878
immunity from one strain to
another;

00:03:40.878 --> 00:03:46.060
acquired immunity,
that is, is strain specific.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.583
Well, mutability also explains
an epidemiological feature of

00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:56.198
influenza,
and that is that pandemics tend

00:03:56.198 --> 00:04:00.270
to arrive in waves,
each being biologically

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.889
different, with different
symptoms and different

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:04.889
virulence.
 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:10.114
And we'll see that the great
pandemic, after World War I,

00:04:10.114 --> 00:04:12.258
had four major waves.
 

00:04:12.258 --> 00:04:20.033
Well, influenza tends to be
reflective of the relationships

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:24.860
also of human beings and
animals--

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.447
birds, horses and pigs--in that
there's interspecies transfer

00:04:30.447 --> 00:04:35.350
from animals to humans,
and from humans in the reverse

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.259
direction.
 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.966
And this may be the route by
which human beings first

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:43.877
contracted the disease,
and it's known that this,

00:04:43.877 --> 00:04:49.810
the animal reservoir,
is a source of new strains.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.033
The hypothesis recently has
been that there's a reservoir in

00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:58.839
Asia, perhaps in China or
Asiatic Russia.

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:02.732
But interestingly,
it's that very hypothesis that

00:05:02.732 --> 00:05:07.353
misled public health responses
when the swine flu pandemic

00:05:07.353 --> 00:05:12.300
first got underway,
in that surveillance was active

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.009
in the Far East but the disease
arrived instead in Mexico.

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.810
What's the history of human
beings and influenza?

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.000
The origins simply aren't known.
 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.966
The earliest clear evidence,
of a literary kind,

00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:33.850
is in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.079
But records are fragmentary and
unreliable.

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:42.980
So, the best we can do is to
look at the last few centuries;

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.867
the eighteenth,
nineteenth, twentieth,

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:49.069
and the first years of our own
century.

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:56.360
In the eighteenth century,
there were major pandemics:

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.175
1729 to '30,
'32 to '33, '61 to '62,

00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:09.430
and then especially 1781 to
1782, and then 1788 to 1789.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.526
In the nineteenth century there
were pandemics 1830 to '31,

00:06:15.526 --> 00:06:20.362
'33, '50 to '51,
and then the great pandemic of

00:06:20.362 --> 00:06:22.149
1889 to 1890.
 

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:27.142
And in the twentieth century
we've had a number of pandemics,

00:06:27.142 --> 00:06:31.319
the greatest being 1918 to '20;
the Spanish Flu,

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:32.930
as it was called.
 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.490
Now, the reason I was reading
out the rather grim years of

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.170
influenza pandemics was to point
out first,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.139
of course, that they're
recurrent and are still with us,

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.607
as you know,
but also to note that there

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:53.408
seemed to be something of a
pattern of more or less one

00:06:53.408 --> 00:06:56.610
major pandemic in every century.
 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.144
Well, influenza is a viral
infection transmitted person to

00:07:02.144 --> 00:07:04.947
person;
an airborne disease,

00:07:04.947 --> 00:07:10.827
much more contagious than say
SARS, that we remember from just

00:07:10.827 --> 00:07:12.660
a few years ago.
 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.307
SARS requires prolonged
face-to-face contact,

00:07:17.307 --> 00:07:19.420
but not influenza.
 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.961
So, a notable feature then of
the flu is its rapid

00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:25.629
communicability.
 

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:30.545
It also has a short incubation
period, just twenty-four to

00:07:30.545 --> 00:07:32.269
seventy-two hours.
 

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:37.884
All of that implies also that
epidemiologically it's different

00:07:37.884 --> 00:07:43.129
from a number of the infectious
diseases we've studied.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:48.779
As I said in the email that I
sent to you about social

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:52.033
diseases,
it's really a spectrum,

00:07:52.033 --> 00:07:55.564
not an absolute,
when we talk about being a

00:07:55.564 --> 00:07:57.319
social disease or not.
 

00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:02.620
And I would submit to you that
influenza is at the far end of

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.420
that spectrum,
in not really being a classic

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.100
social disease.
 

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:14.336
It's not very sensitive to
economic conditions,

00:08:14.336 --> 00:08:19.730
sanitation and diet;
those features that were

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.149
hallmarks of malaria,
say, or tuberculosis.

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:30.516
Its diffusion occurs wherever
human beings move in numbers and

00:08:30.516 --> 00:08:31.560
breathe.
 

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.890
It follows networks of
communication:

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:39.240
railroads, steamships,
airplanes in our time;

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.062
and ports and railroad hub
cities, or now we would say

00:08:44.062 --> 00:08:48.158
airport centers,
tend to be foci of infection,

00:08:48.158 --> 00:08:52.710
and were first attacked with
lightening speed.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:57.187
So, flu was favored by the
transportation technology of the

00:08:57.187 --> 00:09:02.691
industrial revolution and since,
and once again by urbanization,

00:09:02.691 --> 00:09:07.210
and of course population growth
and overcrowding.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:13.394
Let's look at a precursor to
the great pandemic of the First

00:09:13.394 --> 00:09:18.635
World War, and this is the
horrible pandemic of the

00:09:18.635 --> 00:09:22.830
nineteenth century,
of 1889 to 1890.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.485
This was the first truly global
pandemic of influenza,

00:09:27.485 --> 00:09:32.669
and the most devastating one in
history, until that time.

00:09:32.669 --> 00:09:35.678
It affected every continent.
 

00:09:35.678 --> 00:09:40.331
The reasons were that the world
was prepared now for pandemic

00:09:40.331 --> 00:09:42.678
influenza,
as a result of the

00:09:42.678 --> 00:09:46.552
transportation revolution--
the railroad and the

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:49.779
steamship--urbanization and
trade,

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:53.918
demographic growth and
colonialism.

00:09:53.918 --> 00:09:59.135
Vulnerability to influenza then
seems to be, in part,

00:09:59.135 --> 00:10:04.553
a byproduct of modernization,
as we've been reminded by

00:10:04.553 --> 00:10:06.360
recent events.
 

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:13.889
Studies of 1889 to 1890
demonstrate this in more detail.

00:10:13.889 --> 00:10:17.890
In cities like Moscow,
Paris or London,

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:24.000
the first cases occurred in
October to November of 1889.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.950
And these tended not to be
noticed;

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:31.841
there was nothing particular
about them that people noted at

00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:32.940
the time.
 

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.214
But they occurred among very
particular sectors of the

00:10:37.214 --> 00:10:40.681
population that were most
involved in trade,

00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:44.230
commerce and the nodes of
communication;

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:49.889
that is, the first people to
fall ill tended to be dockers or

00:10:49.889 --> 00:10:52.908
post-office workers,
railway men,

00:10:52.908 --> 00:10:54.230
policemen.
 

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.057
Furthermore,
the less industrialized the

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:02.868
locality, the more remote and
agricultural it was,

00:11:02.868 --> 00:11:08.168
the later and less severely the
locality suffered.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:13.379
In 1889 to 1890,
the Alps in Europe,

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:17.663
Italy, Spain and Portugal,
all lagged behind Northern

00:11:17.663 --> 00:11:22.374
Europe and the United States,
and even in the great urban

00:11:22.374 --> 00:11:26.840
centers there were isolated,
small communities that

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.668
sometimes survived entirely
unscathed;

00:11:30.668 --> 00:11:34.125
monasteries and convents,
for example,

00:11:34.125 --> 00:11:39.356
in both Moscow and Paris
experienced the pandemic without

00:11:39.356 --> 00:11:41.879
victims, in some cases.
 

00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:47.616
And this was sometimes true
also of closed institutions like

00:11:47.616 --> 00:11:48.590
prisons.
 

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.578
Then typically,
after following the

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:57.206
transportation network--and this
was true of 1889 to '90--the flu

00:11:57.206 --> 00:12:01.690
spread along what's called the
urban hierarchy;

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:07.315
that is, it went first to major
cities, and from there into the

00:12:07.315 --> 00:12:12.033
hinterland of those cities,
and only later to smaller

00:12:12.033 --> 00:12:15.298
towns, villages and rural areas.
 

00:12:15.298 --> 00:12:18.806
And 1918 to '19,
in the United States,

00:12:18.806 --> 00:12:23.796
shows this same pattern;
that is, the flu went almost

00:12:23.796 --> 00:12:28.940
instantaneously from Boston and
New York to Cincinnati,

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.259
Chicago, New Orleans,
Detroit, San Francisco,

00:12:32.259 --> 00:12:38.466
Seattle, and then at greater
leisure it moved into almost

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:43.342
every place in between,
until there was hardly a

00:12:43.342 --> 00:12:47.830
settlement of any size that had
been entirely spared.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.029
Wherever it went,
rich and poor,

00:12:51.029 --> 00:12:54.951
educated and illiterate,
men and women,

00:12:54.951 --> 00:13:01.350
the physically fit and the
unfit, were similarly infected.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.719
But there were circumstances,
certain ones,

00:13:04.719 --> 00:13:08.570
that were especially favorable
to the disease.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:14.129
A crowded urban environment was
clearly one,

00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:18.269
where people were streaming in
and out,

00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:21.500
in closely packed milieus:
schools,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.347
theaters, barracks,
naval ships,

00:13:24.347 --> 00:13:29.570
tenement buildings,
college dormitories.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:34.942
In all the epidemics of
influenza, except 1918 to '20,

00:13:34.942 --> 00:13:40.211
there was also a strong
predilection of the influenza

00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:44.470
virus for the infants and the
elderly.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:49.356
There also tended to be an
over-representation of people

00:13:49.356 --> 00:13:53.090
with pre-existing respiratory
diseases--

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:57.450
say tuberculosis or
bronchitis--or people with

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.259
immunosuppressive diseases.
 

00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:04.202
The great example,
until the HIV/AIDS era,

00:14:04.202 --> 00:14:08.436
was, of course,
malaria, and malarial victims

00:14:08.436 --> 00:14:12.379
were highly susceptible to
influenza.

00:14:12.379 --> 00:14:18.956
So, the tubercular and the
malarial died massively during

00:14:18.956 --> 00:14:21.538
influenza pandemics.
 

00:14:21.538 --> 00:14:28.568
A typical graph then of the
influenza mortality would show a

00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:33.567
neat U-shaped curve,
spiked at both ends of the age

00:14:33.567 --> 00:14:39.908
spectrum of the population,
the very young and the elderly.

00:14:39.908 --> 00:14:44.335
Another common feature of
influenza pandemics was

00:14:44.335 --> 00:14:46.639
pronounced seasonality.
 

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:51.086
In the Northern Hemisphere,
influenza almost invariably

00:14:51.086 --> 00:14:55.581
peaked in the winter months,
November to February,

00:14:55.581 --> 00:15:00.850
and ended with the coming of
warm weather in the spring.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.923
The reasons for--good
epidemiological explanations

00:15:04.923 --> 00:15:08.250
have to do partly with human
behavior.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:12.215
People tend to congregate
indoors in the winter,

00:15:12.215 --> 00:15:17.110
often in buildings and rooms
that are poorly ventilated.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:21.153
The virus itself doesn't
survive well in an environment

00:15:21.153 --> 00:15:24.450
where there's sunlight and high
humidity,

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:29.955
and winter is a time when
people tend to sneeze and cough

00:15:29.955 --> 00:15:32.610
more than at other times.
 

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.899
What are some other features of
flu pandemics?

00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:37.798
One is short duration.
 

00:15:37.798 --> 00:15:41.629
This helps to understand
societal responses as well.

00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:46.485
We know that plague and cholera
tended to lay siege to a

00:15:46.485 --> 00:15:50.724
locality for months,
and in the community it felt

00:15:50.724 --> 00:15:52.490
quite like that.
 

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:59.450
But flu tended to last just a
few weeks, and then to move on.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:04.148
It was true also that there was
a high morbidity--that is,

00:16:04.148 --> 00:16:09.094
lots of people would fall ill
from influenza--but there was a

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:11.320
low case fatality rate.
 

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:16.556
The overall mortality would be
large simply because of the

00:16:16.556 --> 00:16:19.220
large numbers of sufferers.
 

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.850
The kill rate was low.
 

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:27.240
In the nineteenth century,
influenza, however,

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.706
killed far more people than
cholera, and a stark contrast

00:16:32.706 --> 00:16:35.048
then could be drawn.
 

00:16:35.048 --> 00:16:39.278
Flu seems to be
quintessentially a contagious

00:16:39.278 --> 00:16:40.240
disease.
 

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.509
But since you're interested in
the debate between--

00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:45.879
this is one of your favorites,
I'm sure--

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:50.350
between anticontagionism and
contagionism,

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:54.751
we might point out to you that
even although you think it seems

00:16:54.751 --> 00:16:57.379
to be self-evident that
influenza,

00:16:57.379 --> 00:17:02.308
the grippe, the flu is
contagious, that many of the,

00:17:02.308 --> 00:17:07.078
in fact the dominant current,
still in the 1890s,

00:17:07.078 --> 00:17:10.680
was that influenza was not
contagious.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.951
And the eminent British
epidemiologist,

00:17:13.951 --> 00:17:18.086
Charles Creighton,
still held to anticontagionism

00:17:18.086 --> 00:17:22.220
regarding this disease,
down into the 1890s.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:27.978
Well, what sorts of things held
Creighton back from accepting

00:17:27.978 --> 00:17:31.528
influenza as an infectious
disease?

00:17:31.528 --> 00:17:36.049
First he argued the disease
would affect most parts of a

00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:39.420
country in the same two or three
weeks.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:44.984
There simply wasn't time for a
contagious disease to spread

00:17:44.984 --> 00:17:48.920
with that extreme rapidity,
he thought.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.632
He also thought within a
smaller radius it seemed to

00:17:52.632 --> 00:17:55.180
affect everyone,
say in a household,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.509
more or less simultaneously.
 

00:17:57.509 --> 00:18:00.338
Everyone would fall ill at once.
 

00:18:00.338 --> 00:18:04.568
So, it seemed there wasn't time
for contagion.

00:18:04.568 --> 00:18:09.046
And it was this simultaneous,
sudden outbreak of influenza

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:12.579
that gave it some of its
traditional names.

00:18:12.579 --> 00:18:16.009
It was called the grippe;
not only in French,

00:18:16.009 --> 00:18:18.818
la grippe,
but also in English in the

00:18:18.818 --> 00:18:22.150
nineteenth century it was
referred to as grippe.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:26.439
And partly that's because it
seemed suddenly to seize people

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:27.528
in its grasp.
 

00:18:27.528 --> 00:18:31.457
Typically, you could be healthy
at breakfast,

00:18:31.457 --> 00:18:35.920
only to find yourself suffering
with chills, fever,

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.578
aching bones and nausea by
lunchtime.

00:18:39.578 --> 00:18:43.057
Similarly, Moscow seemed,
to physicians,

00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:46.980
to be healthy on the first of
November, 1889,

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:52.509
but by the middle of the month
the disease was everywhere.

00:18:52.509 --> 00:18:57.211
Shops and schools were closed,
commerce nearly ground to a

00:18:57.211 --> 00:18:57.788
halt.
 

00:18:57.788 --> 00:19:02.459
And this gave it--was part of
the reason it got its other

00:19:02.459 --> 00:19:03.960
name, influenza.
 

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.240
This was an Italian word
meaning influence,

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.852
and in this case people
speculated about the influence

00:19:12.852 --> 00:19:18.509
of some cosmic factor that would
disturb the microcosm as well.

00:19:18.509 --> 00:19:24.010
Perhaps it was the influence of
the stars or the heavens that

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:28.871
poisoned or corrupted the
atmosphere and lay low whole

00:19:28.871 --> 00:19:30.980
cities all at once.
 

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.950
What about symptoms,
effects on the individual?

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:40.178
I think we can be brief,
because it's probably very

00:19:40.178 --> 00:19:43.900
familiar to you,
from personal experience;

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.308
that is, seasonal influenza.
 

00:19:47.308 --> 00:19:51.920
The onset, as we've said,
is normally sudden.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.642
The symptoms then are ones that
you know: a high fever,

00:19:57.642 --> 00:20:02.200
100 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically;

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:08.186
an unproductive cough;
aching of muscles in the back,

00:20:08.186 --> 00:20:11.539
the legs;
watery eyes;

00:20:11.539 --> 00:20:16.839
sometimes nausea and vomiting;
general malaise;

00:20:16.839 --> 00:20:19.240
headache;
pain in the joints;

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:25.125
sometimes dizziness;
and a general sense of fatigue

00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:26.920
and weakness.
 

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.907
Typically the acute phase would
last three to five days,

00:20:31.907 --> 00:20:37.349
and for a few days more you'd
suffer from your cough and from

00:20:37.349 --> 00:20:38.529
lethargy.
 

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:44.920
And then, in the vast number of
cases, there would be recovery.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:51.159
Flu, for young adults in good
health, enjoyed a reputation as

00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:56.670
a nasty but mercifully short,
and usually not serious,

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.230
affliction.
 

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:02.210
Influenza in the middle of the
nineteenth century--

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:08.900
that is, at least before the
cataclysm of 1889 and 1890--

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:13.872
was--people joked about it,
that it was a disease that was

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:18.670
so unimportant that the only
physicians who gave it much

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:23.730
attention were those who simply
had too few patients,

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:29.204
and so started treating people
with flu as a means of enhancing

00:21:29.204 --> 00:21:30.528
their income.
 

00:21:30.528 --> 00:21:33.468
On the other hand,
for infants,

00:21:33.468 --> 00:21:37.973
for the elderly and those with
chronic disease,

00:21:37.973 --> 00:21:43.950
it sometimes led to serious and
even fatal complications;

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:48.664
and it was the complications,
much more than the flu,

00:21:48.664 --> 00:21:50.660
that tended to kill.
 

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:56.343
Patients who didn't recover
after three or four days then

00:21:56.343 --> 00:22:01.416
moved on to serious
complications like pneumonia or

00:22:01.416 --> 00:22:02.940
bronchitis.
 

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:08.114
And about once a century,
a strain of influenza that was

00:22:08.114 --> 00:22:11.690
not seasonal but pandemic
appeared,

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:15.190
and demonstrated that flu can
in fact,

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.882
under certain conditions,
be one of the most deadly of

00:22:19.882 --> 00:22:21.210
all diseases.
 

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.618
Well, what about treatment?
 

00:22:24.618 --> 00:22:29.675
Today, as in the past,
there's no specific remedy for

00:22:29.675 --> 00:22:35.121
influenza, as we've been
reminded by recent events in the

00:22:35.121 --> 00:22:36.578
newspapers.
 

00:22:36.578 --> 00:22:42.166
The disease is self-limiting
normally, and simply runs its

00:22:42.166 --> 00:22:43.048
course.
 

00:22:43.048 --> 00:22:49.166
So, therapy is supportive and
symptomatic, rest and nursing

00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:54.019
care, more than active medical
intervention.

00:22:54.019 --> 00:22:58.012
In the nineteenth century this
was also recognized,

00:22:58.012 --> 00:23:02.325
and physicians weren't inclined
to try heroic remedies,

00:23:02.325 --> 00:23:05.598
as they did say with Asiatic
cholera.

00:23:05.598 --> 00:23:10.326
But there were certain attempts
at therapeutics in the

00:23:10.326 --> 00:23:15.038
nineteenth century,
and even after World War I

00:23:15.038 --> 00:23:20.930
people were given aspirin,
cinnamon with milk to lower

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.161
temperature,
fluids and nourishment,

00:23:25.161 --> 00:23:26.338
bed rest.
 

00:23:26.338 --> 00:23:30.528
Quinine was administered to
lower the fever.

00:23:30.528 --> 00:23:34.078
There were warm baths for
hydrotherapy;

00:23:34.078 --> 00:23:39.131
oxygen sometimes administered
to patients with respiratory

00:23:39.131 --> 00:23:40.548
complications.
 

00:23:40.548 --> 00:23:46.065
And some physicians recommended
caffeine to raise the flagging

00:23:46.065 --> 00:23:49.140
animal energy,
as it was called.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.484
Today the only actual
therapeutics is antibiotics,

00:23:53.484 --> 00:23:57.210
but they don't combat the
influenza itself,

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:00.578
but its complication of
pneumonia.

00:24:00.578 --> 00:24:05.067
Well, against that background,
let's look more closely at the

00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:08.134
Spanish influenza--
the Spanish Lady,

00:24:08.134 --> 00:24:13.462
the Spanish grippe,
as it was called--from 1918 to

00:24:13.462 --> 00:24:14.160
1920.
 

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.984
Well, first you'll probably
wonder, why this Spanish

00:24:18.984 --> 00:24:20.308
association?
 

00:24:20.308 --> 00:24:25.441
And the reason has actually
nothing to do with Spain itself

00:24:25.441 --> 00:24:26.680
and disease.
 

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.945
It was simply that Spain was
not a belligerent in the First

00:24:30.945 --> 00:24:35.578
World War, and therefore was
free of censorship of the media.

00:24:35.578 --> 00:24:40.992
Hence a free press reported the
medical crisis there

00:24:40.992 --> 00:24:42.480
extensively.
 

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:48.880
A popular theory in circulation
these days is that perhaps the

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.391
Spanish Lady originated not in
Spain at all,

00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:55.279
but in Kansas.
 

00:24:55.279 --> 00:24:59.666
In any event,
on the morning of--finding the

00:24:59.666 --> 00:25:04.534
case zero is a perilous art,
but let's say that at least

00:25:04.534 --> 00:25:07.878
this much is known--
on the morning of the eleventh

00:25:07.878 --> 00:25:11.039
of March,
1918, at Fort Riley,

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:16.710
the cook, Albert Gitchell,
reported sick.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:21.895
By noon, the camp infirmary had
some 100 cases,

00:25:21.895 --> 00:25:27.871
and these were the earliest
known examples of this new

00:25:27.871 --> 00:25:29.450
influenza.
 

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:34.515
There's some background that
helps us comprehend the

00:25:34.515 --> 00:25:38.190
extraordinary case of 1918 to
1920.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:41.737
As in the past,
mutations occurred,

00:25:41.737 --> 00:25:47.893
and in this time produced a new
strain that turned out to be

00:25:47.893 --> 00:25:53.108
more virulent than any in
influenza's history.

00:25:53.108 --> 00:25:57.179
Its mode of communication was
identical to other flu

00:25:57.179 --> 00:26:01.965
pandemics, but its effects on
both the individual and society

00:26:01.965 --> 00:26:04.278
were radically different.
 

00:26:04.278 --> 00:26:09.034
So, let's talk about this
pandemic as coming in four

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:09.778
waves.
 

00:26:09.778 --> 00:26:17.046
The first was in the spring of
1918, and was relatively mild,

00:26:17.046 --> 00:26:19.588
in March and April.
 

00:26:19.588 --> 00:26:23.153
It soon passed,
and it attracted little

00:26:23.153 --> 00:26:24.278
attention.
 

00:26:24.278 --> 00:26:28.118
Wartime press censorship was
partly a factor,

00:26:28.118 --> 00:26:33.413
but people were simply
preoccupied with the war and not

00:26:33.413 --> 00:26:38.807
with the presence of a mild
outbreak of a well-known and

00:26:38.807 --> 00:26:40.670
common disease.
 

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:48.900
The second wave was the fall of
1918, which was the worldwide

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.410
disaster.
 

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:55.542
It began in August with
simultaneous explosions in

00:26:55.542 --> 00:27:01.723
places as far apart as Sierra
Leone, Boston in this country,

00:27:01.723 --> 00:27:05.952
Brest in France;
a common feature being that

00:27:05.952 --> 00:27:10.298
these were all port cities,
and had an important role in

00:27:10.298 --> 00:27:13.460
the movements of troops and
supplies.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.000
In this case,
one could argue that not only

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.711
the war itself,
but also the coming of peace,

00:27:20.711 --> 00:27:24.170
contributed to the spread of
the flu.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:30.102
Armistice Day itself produced
huge crowds and gatherings,

00:27:30.102 --> 00:27:35.928
which were not propitious for
stopping the spread of the

00:27:35.928 --> 00:27:37.200
disease.
 

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:42.882
Then came the spring of 1919,
a less, much less,

00:27:42.882 --> 00:27:46.509
mercifully less severe wave.
 

00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:50.652
And then finally January,
February of 1920,

00:27:50.652 --> 00:27:55.682
the fourth wave of the Spanish
Lady, which was mild,

00:27:55.682 --> 00:27:59.430
and limited in its morbidity
even.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.605
Partly, of course,
because by then so many people

00:28:03.605 --> 00:28:05.519
were already immune.
 

00:28:05.519 --> 00:28:09.673
Well, there are a number of
features of the Spanish Lady

00:28:09.673 --> 00:28:11.410
that made her unique.
 

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:17.334
The first was that it possessed
an extraordinary mortality and

00:28:17.334 --> 00:28:18.500
morbidity.
 

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.769
Comparing it with normal
outbreaks of influenza,

00:28:22.769 --> 00:28:27.220
it's impossible to generate
precise statistics.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:31.440
But there are speculations that
this was perhaps,

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.384
in absolute terms,
the greatest demographic shock

00:28:35.384 --> 00:28:39.411
that humanity had ever
experienced from infectious

00:28:39.411 --> 00:28:40.480
diseases.
 

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:46.246
More people died of influenza
than of casualties in the First

00:28:46.246 --> 00:28:47.400
World War.
 

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:52.192
Worldwide, some estimates--the
estimates vary widely,

00:28:52.192 --> 00:28:56.338
so one has to take them with
great caution.

00:28:56.338 --> 00:29:01.397
But they ranged from 25,000,000
people perishing,

00:29:01.397 --> 00:29:07.509
upwards to--the highest
estimates are about 100,000,000.

00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:13.007
In the United States it's
pretty well known that at least

00:29:13.007 --> 00:29:18.057
675,000 people perished;
more than American casualties

00:29:18.057 --> 00:29:23.784
in all twentieth-century wars;
ten times the numbers killed in

00:29:23.784 --> 00:29:25.460
First World War.
 

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:30.894
In a normal--if there is such a
thing--influenza outbreak,

00:29:30.894 --> 00:29:36.519
a case fatality rate might be
something like 0.1 percent.

00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:39.500
In the case of the Spanish
influenza,

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:45.088
the case fatality rate was just
above 2.5 percent,

00:29:45.088 --> 00:29:50.088
and this yielded a vast total
mortality,

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:52.549
because indeed,
as it seemed at the time,

00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:55.858
almost everyone was infected.
 

00:29:55.858 --> 00:30:00.788
Let's look at a slide of the
death rates.

00:30:00.788 --> 00:30:06.163
You can see the influenza,
the great wave in October,

00:30:06.163 --> 00:30:09.160
November, December of 1918.
 

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:16.858
The black is 1918--rather,
sorry, is the average 1911 to

00:30:16.858 --> 00:30:20.920
1917, and the grey is 1918.
 

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.832
So, this compares influenza
then with what we might call

00:30:25.832 --> 00:30:27.528
normal influenza.
 

00:30:27.528 --> 00:30:31.710
You can see the extraordinary
new mortality.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:36.124
Another feature of this
influenza was the lack of

00:30:36.124 --> 00:30:40.630
understanding of the disease
when it broke out.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.808
Indeed, I'd like to quote
Victor Vaughan,

00:30:43.808 --> 00:30:48.500
who directed public health in
the United States Army against

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.170
the Spanish Lady.
 

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.941
And he said,
and I'm quoting:

00:30:52.941 --> 00:30:57.297
"Doctors know no more
about the flu than

00:30:57.297 --> 00:31:03.930
fourteenth-century Florentines
did about the Black Death."

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:09.290
And I think it's important to
understand this idea of a sense

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:13.759
of helplessness facing this
medical catastrophe.

00:31:13.759 --> 00:31:17.674
Some physicians indeed,
in 1918, termed what they were

00:31:17.674 --> 00:31:20.630
facing "epidemic
pneumonia."

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:24.438
And then, as now,
there was no effective

00:31:24.438 --> 00:31:25.609
treatment.
 

00:31:25.609 --> 00:31:28.519
The symptoms were distinctive.
 

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:32.190
As you now know from reading
Crosby,

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:37.997
this influenza was fulminant,
and post-mortem lung

00:31:37.997 --> 00:31:44.869
examinations revealed things
that were unlike anything that

00:31:44.869 --> 00:31:49.730
examining physicians had seen
before.

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:55.034
Enormous quantities of bloody
fluid, like a froth,

00:31:55.034 --> 00:31:57.200
filling the lungs.
 

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.627
Some physicians,
on their first encounter,

00:32:00.627 --> 00:32:05.058
suspected that this was a kind
of pneumonic plague.

00:32:05.058 --> 00:32:08.720
Right here in New Haven,
in the New Haven Hospital,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.651
pathologists wrote that the
devastation caused to the lungs

00:32:13.651 --> 00:32:17.647
more than anything else
resembled the effects of

00:32:17.647 --> 00:32:22.068
poisonous gases used in World
War I,-like phosgene or

00:32:22.068 --> 00:32:25.736
chlorine,
were the comparisons that came

00:32:25.736 --> 00:32:26.890
to their mind.
 

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.307
Furthermore,
although other organs of the

00:32:30.307 --> 00:32:35.107
body could be affected--
the spleen, for example--the

00:32:35.107 --> 00:32:40.448
impact of the Spanish Lady on
the lungs was so overwhelming

00:32:40.448 --> 00:32:44.960
that that alone was often the
cause of death,

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.719
and pulmonary effects were
almost the only ones that people

00:32:49.719 --> 00:32:50.538
noticed.
 

00:32:50.538 --> 00:32:56.406
Let me read a passage from
Katherine Anne Porter,

00:32:56.406 --> 00:33:00.317
the famous writer,
Pale Horse,

00:33:00.317 --> 00:33:05.817
Pale Rider,
where she was herself a victim

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:08.630
of the influenza.
 

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.538
And she writes here in the
third person,

00:33:11.538 --> 00:33:14.269
but she's describing her own
symptoms,

00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:17.413
and I think it's worth noting
how she felt:

00:33:17.413 --> 00:33:21.482
"Silenced,
Miranda sank easily through

00:33:21.482 --> 00:33:27.071
deeps upon deeps of darkness,
until she lay like a stone at

00:33:27.071 --> 00:33:32.372
the farthest bottom of life,
knowing herself to be blind,

00:33:32.372 --> 00:33:35.913
deaf, speechless,
no longer aware of the members

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:39.208
of her own body,
entirely withdrawn from all

00:33:39.208 --> 00:33:42.884
human concerns,
yet alive with a peculiar

00:33:42.884 --> 00:33:45.029
lucidity and coherence.
 

00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:48.651
All notions of the mind,
the reasonable inquiries of

00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:51.451
doubt,
all ties of blood and desires

00:33:51.451 --> 00:33:54.561
of the heart,
dissolved and fell away from

00:33:54.561 --> 00:33:57.410
her, and there remained only a
minute,

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:02.150
fiercely burning particle of
being that knew itself alone,

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:06.450
that relied upon nothing beyond
itself for its strength,

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:10.369
not susceptible to any appeal
or inducement,

00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:14.510
being itself composed entirely
of one single motive,

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.139
the stubborn will to live.
 

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:22.664
This fiery, motionless particle
set itself unaided to resist

00:34:22.664 --> 00:34:26.023
destruction,
to survive, and to be in its

00:34:26.023 --> 00:34:30.414
own madness of being,
motiveless and planless,

00:34:30.414 --> 00:34:34.010
beyond that one essential end.
 

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:39.157
She felt, without warning,
a vague tremor of apprehension,

00:34:39.157 --> 00:34:42.949
some small flick of distrust in
her joy.

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:47.280
A thin frost touched the edges
of this confident tranquility.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.079
Something, somebody was missing.
 

00:34:49.079 --> 00:34:50.469
She'd lost something.
 

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:53.199
She had left something valuable
in another country.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.369
What could it be?
 

00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:58.407
'There are no trees,
no trees here,' she said in

00:34:58.407 --> 00:34:58.989
fright.
 

00:34:58.989 --> 00:35:01.360
'I've left something
unfinished.'

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.684
A thought struggled at the back
of her mind, came clearly as a

00:35:04.684 --> 00:35:05.719
voice in her ear.
 

00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:06.880
'Where are the dead?
 

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.210
We've forgotten the dead.
 

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:10.530
The dead, where are they?'
 

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:14.422
At once, as if a curtain had
fallen, the bright landscape

00:35:14.422 --> 00:35:14.980
faded.
 

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.434
She was alone in a strange
stony place of bitter cold,

00:35:19.434 --> 00:35:23.722
picking her way along a steep
path of slippery snow,

00:35:23.722 --> 00:35:26.750
calling out,
'Oh I must go back.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.250
But in what direction?'
 

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.327
Pain returned,
a terrible compelling pain,

00:35:32.327 --> 00:35:35.630
running through her veins like
heavy fire.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:39.630
The stench of corruption filled
her nostrils.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:43.429
The sweetish,
sickening smell of rotting

00:35:43.429 --> 00:35:44.989
flesh and pus.
 

00:35:44.989 --> 00:35:49.121
She opened her eyes and saw
pale light through a coarse

00:35:49.121 --> 00:35:53.367
white cloth over her face,
and she knew that the smell of

00:35:53.367 --> 00:35:58.273
death was in her own body,
and she struggled to lift her

00:35:58.273 --> 00:35:59.518
hand."
 

00:35:59.518 --> 00:36:05.400
There are also pictures
of--this is a famous painting of

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.248
Edvard Munch,
After the Influenza,

00:36:09.248 --> 00:36:10.960
in 1919.
 

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.862
Or this is also--in fact,
this is called After the

00:36:15.862 --> 00:36:18.409
Flu, painted in 1919.
 

00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:21.871
A doctor wrote that his
patients died,

00:36:21.871 --> 00:36:27.112
struggling to clear their
airways of a blood-tinged froth

00:36:27.112 --> 00:36:31.230
that gushed from their noses and
mouths.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:35.034
The fluid then filled the
respiratory system,

00:36:35.034 --> 00:36:40.050
from the trachea to the tiniest
alveoli and bronchioles.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:44.974
And at post-mortem examination
the lungs were greatly

00:36:44.974 --> 00:36:48.858
distended, and when pressed,
even lightly,

00:36:48.858 --> 00:36:53.500
oozed with blood-tinged fluid
and yellow pus.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.760
The walls of the alveoli
collapsed under the pressure,

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.905
leaving a formless mass where
neither blood nor air could flow

00:37:02.905 --> 00:37:05.527
freely,
and the patient died of

00:37:05.527 --> 00:37:09.550
asphyxia, or the blockage of
pulmonary circulation.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:14.715
Let me show you two pictures of
the lungs of a young woman who

00:37:14.715 --> 00:37:19.289
died of the Spanish Lady at the
New Haven Hospital,

00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:24.376
and I think you can see the
enormous and terrifying

00:37:24.376 --> 00:37:28.550
destruction of the lungs that
occurred.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:33.570
Well, in addition,
there were important sequelae.

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:38.835
One feature of the Spanish Lady
was the distinctive length of

00:37:38.835 --> 00:37:40.239
convalescence.
 

00:37:40.239 --> 00:37:44.239
And also there were
neurological aftereffects,

00:37:44.239 --> 00:37:48.523
protracted depression,
and there is speculation that

00:37:48.523 --> 00:37:53.311
throughout the 1920s there was
an outbreak of neurological

00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:56.900
afflictions,
that Oliver Sacks deals with in

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.340
his famous book
Awakenings.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.730
There's some dispute about
whether this was an authentic,

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:07.572
among authentic sequelae of the
Spanish influenza,

00:38:07.572 --> 00:38:10.159
but it is at least plausible.
 

00:38:10.159 --> 00:38:15.775
Another feature that made this
pandemic distinctive was the age

00:38:15.775 --> 00:38:18.039
profile of the victims.
 

00:38:18.039 --> 00:38:22.097
We've seen how normally in
influenza there's a U-shaped

00:38:22.097 --> 00:38:22.699
curve.
 

00:38:22.699 --> 00:38:27.614
It does what seems normal to
people, attacking the very young

00:38:27.614 --> 00:38:29.090
and the elderly.
 

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:34.157
The Spanish Lady instead had a
preference for adults in the

00:38:34.157 --> 00:38:37.039
twenty to forty-year age group.
 

00:38:37.039 --> 00:38:41.442
And so it produced something
that seemed highly unnatural,

00:38:41.442 --> 00:38:44.840
a W-shaped curve,
with a spike in the middle,

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.469
afflicting the people in the
prime of life.

00:38:48.469 --> 00:38:53.871
Victor Vaughan again observed
that the Spanish flu imitated

00:38:53.871 --> 00:38:57.505
the war itself,
and that it killed young

00:38:57.505 --> 00:38:58.530
adults.
 

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:03.289
Like war, he said,
this infection kills young,

00:39:03.289 --> 00:39:06.039
vigorous, robust adults.
 

00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:08.820
The reasons are still
mysterious.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.239
But one could point to a couple
of partial factors.

00:39:12.239 --> 00:39:17.985
Perhaps the elderly had some
immunity left over from the

00:39:17.985 --> 00:39:21.329
great pandemic of 1889 to '90.
 

00:39:21.329 --> 00:39:25.326
And it was the young,
of course, epidemiologically,

00:39:25.326 --> 00:39:29.961
who most directly experienced
the war and military service,

00:39:29.961 --> 00:39:35.297
in close, crowded conditions;
just the young population,

00:39:35.297 --> 00:39:36.750
most at risk.
 

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:41.175
And for those of you who think
that working out at the gym

00:39:41.175 --> 00:39:44.360
protects you from influenza
pandemics,

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:49.715
I would point out that the
physically fit also fell ill in

00:39:49.715 --> 00:39:51.690
comparable numbers.
 

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:53.929
John Hellum, the U.S.
 

00:39:53.929 --> 00:39:59.501
pentathlon champion--that is,
someone who did the broad jump,

00:39:59.501 --> 00:40:02.753
discus, javelin,
200-meters and 1500

00:40:02.753 --> 00:40:06.840
meters--died in October 1918 of
the flu.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.449
As did Jackie O'Shaughnessy,
who was the U.S.

00:40:10.449 --> 00:40:13.050
National quarter-mile champion.
 

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:17.561
So, physical fitness had
nothing to do with survival from

00:40:17.561 --> 00:40:18.849
the influenza.
 

00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:21.829
Let me show you a graph.
 

00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:27.349
This is the notorious U-shaped
curve of the influenza.

00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:29.639
And you see the two curves
together.

00:40:29.639 --> 00:40:35.443
The dotted line is normal
influenza, and this solid line,

00:40:35.443 --> 00:40:41.143
with the terrible W in the
middle, is the mortality from

00:40:41.143 --> 00:40:43.320
the Spanish Lady.
 

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.460
Well, meanwhile,
what happened with public

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.150
health?
 

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:51.780
And here a major feature is to
point out--

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:55.869
and we should think of this in
terms of lessons for

00:40:55.869 --> 00:40:59.697
preparedness today--
was the way that the public

00:40:59.697 --> 00:41:02.099
health service was overwhelmed.
 

00:41:02.099 --> 00:41:07.255
It was overwhelmed in part
because of the extreme rapidity

00:41:07.255 --> 00:41:11.235
with which this disease,
through its airborne

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:13.860
transmission,
was spread;

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:21.228
by the speed of transportation,
and the short incubation period

00:41:21.228 --> 00:41:23.250
of the disease.
 

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:27.592
It was also true that there is
a percentage--perhaps ten

00:41:27.592 --> 00:41:32.253
percent, in the Spanish Lady--of
people who are asymptomatic

00:41:32.253 --> 00:41:33.280
carriers.
 

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:39.829
Influenza also was not a
reportable disease.

00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:44.876
It was maximized also because
of the unavoidable and

00:41:44.876 --> 00:41:50.420
uncontrollable movement of
troops, because of the war.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.556
But in addition,
there was a lack--and we might

00:41:53.556 --> 00:41:58.005
think about this--
of preparation for just such an

00:41:58.005 --> 00:42:01.914
emergency,
a shortage of doctors,

00:42:01.914 --> 00:42:08.210
nurses, hospital beds and space
on hospital wards.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:13.079
Influenza also has the terrible
feature,

00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:17.996
unlike cholera for example,
that it creates chaos within

00:42:17.996 --> 00:42:23.474
the health system itself,
by striking down caregivers who

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:27.409
are among those who are most
vulnerable.

00:42:27.409 --> 00:42:31.380
And then there was the war
itself, in which doctors and

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:35.204
nurses were mobilized to deal
with the victims of the

00:42:35.204 --> 00:42:36.159
conflict.
 

00:42:36.159 --> 00:42:40.012
So, there were drastic
shortages of healthcare

00:42:40.012 --> 00:42:44.210
personnel available to the
civilian population.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.840
Rupert Blue,
whom you will remember from the

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.623
Barbary Plague,
was a director of public health

00:42:51.623 --> 00:42:55.771
services during the crisis,
and he was forced to lure

00:42:55.771 --> 00:42:58.940
doctors and nurses out of
retirement,

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:05.244
to help deal with the emergency;
to recruit even from old-age

00:43:05.244 --> 00:43:06.030
homes.
 

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:12.389
Well, what were the measures
adopted to deal with the crisis?

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:14.971
Anti-flu measures,
by this time,

00:43:14.971 --> 00:43:20.300
were based on the premise that
this was a contagious disease,

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.230
and the understanding that
influenza was spread somehow

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.539
through the air.
 

00:43:25.539 --> 00:43:30.590
A first major goal was to
prevent those who were healthy

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:35.460
from inhaling the contaminated
air of the infected.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.880
To that end,
public gatherings and

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:44.998
assemblies of large numbers of
people at close quarters were

00:43:44.998 --> 00:43:46.139
banned.
 

00:43:46.139 --> 00:43:50.081
Public institutions were
closed: schools,

00:43:50.081 --> 00:43:53.530
dancehalls, movie theaters,
bars.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:58.090
Churches in this country were
allowed to remain open,

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:02.389
but the number of services was
greatly reduced.

00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:06.239
In many cities,
people seen by the police to be

00:44:06.239 --> 00:44:10.509
coughing and sneezing,
without covering their faces,

00:44:10.509 --> 00:44:12.768
were stopped and fined.
 

00:44:12.768 --> 00:44:17.003
The New York City Department of
Health posted some 10,000

00:44:17.003 --> 00:44:20.954
placards around the city,
bearing a message that was

00:44:20.954 --> 00:44:24.967
familiar to the public,
because of its similarity to

00:44:24.967 --> 00:44:28.980
the urgings of the campaign
against tuberculosis.

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.389
So, one can see the
anti-tuberculosis campaign

00:44:32.389 --> 00:44:35.798
preparing people,
in a sense, for dealing with

00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:36.860
influenza.
 

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.659
And in New York City the
placards said:

00:44:39.659 --> 00:44:43.050
to prevent the spread of
Spanish influenza,

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:48.650
sneeze, cough or expectorate,
if you absolutely must,

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:54.112
into your own handkerchief;
you're in no danger if everyone

00:44:54.112 --> 00:44:56.579
should heed this warning.
 

00:44:56.579 --> 00:45:03.670
Another widespread measure was
a practical application also.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:08.971
One was masking with gauze
masks, and some municipalities

00:45:08.971 --> 00:45:13.800
required their whole populations
to put on masks.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.110
San Francisco did so,
and so did San Diego.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:22.380
Another was disinfection
practices, applied in hospital

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:25.070
wards, sickrooms and ambulances.
 

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:29.449
Trains too were washed down
with antiseptic solutions.

00:45:29.449 --> 00:45:37.210
You can see a picture of the
properly masked police.

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:39.710
I think this is San Francisco.
 

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:46.373
And here you can see the
general masking of the whole

00:45:46.373 --> 00:45:48.039
population.
 

00:45:48.039 --> 00:45:53.054
And this was a public notice,
a public health poster from

00:45:53.054 --> 00:45:58.157
Kingston, New York or--and it
says about the measures I've

00:45:58.157 --> 00:46:01.425
told you about;
theaters, churches,

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:04.230
schools, hospitals,
and so forth.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:09.239
Or you can see here another
poster for public health.

00:46:09.239 --> 00:46:13.887
State boards of health also
isolated the ill through

00:46:13.887 --> 00:46:18.990
quarantine, as far as possible,
and the military tried to

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.090
quarantine its training camps.
 

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:26.829
On hospital wards,
sheets were hung between beds.

00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:31.719
Ambulance trains were washed
down with antiseptic.

00:46:31.719 --> 00:46:36.449
People were urged to avoid
nervous and physical exhaustion.

00:46:36.449 --> 00:46:39.739
You can see a long legacy of
this idea.

00:46:39.739 --> 00:46:43.706
You remember Laennec talking
about the passions

00:46:43.706 --> 00:46:48.322
tristes, the sad passions,
and their influence on your

00:46:48.322 --> 00:46:49.699
constitution.
 

00:46:49.699 --> 00:46:53.505
So, some of the advice had a
really long history that you'll

00:46:53.505 --> 00:46:54.280
recognize.
 

00:46:54.280 --> 00:47:00.050
And they also cautioned you to
avoid chills.

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:04.344
They urged people to gargle
with warm water and salt,

00:47:04.344 --> 00:47:07.896
and to spray saline solutions
up their nose,

00:47:07.896 --> 00:47:09.880
to wear gauze masks.
 

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:14.623
And legislation was passed to
prevent the use of common

00:47:14.623 --> 00:47:16.030
drinking cups.
 

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:20.172
Some people sprayed their
nostrils with carbolic acid

00:47:20.172 --> 00:47:23.226
spray,
and some towns set up fines to

00:47:23.226 --> 00:47:27.289
punish people they called--
this was one of the jargons at

00:47:27.289 --> 00:47:30.889
the time--
the open-face sneezer.

00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:35.577
New York City modified the
opening hours of stores and

00:47:35.577 --> 00:47:39.469
businesses in order to stagger
rush hour,

00:47:39.469 --> 00:47:44.545
so that subway trains and trams
would not be so crowded and not

00:47:44.545 --> 00:47:46.018
be so dangerous.
 

00:47:46.018 --> 00:47:51.237
Congress voted special funds to
enable Surgeon General Rupert

00:47:51.237 --> 00:47:56.630
Blue to recruit thousands of
doctors and hundreds of nurses.

00:47:56.630 --> 00:48:01.400
But, as I said,
the war effort complicated his

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:06.280
task, and he turned to people
who'd retired.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:12.469
And those were other--I wanted
to show you a camp.

00:48:12.469 --> 00:48:17.128
The fact that it was wartime
made it easy for the government

00:48:17.128 --> 00:48:20.840
to induce people to accept
rigorous measures.

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:24.074
People by this time had grown
used, by 1918,

00:48:24.074 --> 00:48:27.010
to invasive and restrictive
measures.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:30.684
They already knew all about the
draft, or rationing,

00:48:30.684 --> 00:48:32.630
or daylight savings time.
 

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:37.706
But existing facilities were
inadequate to cope with a sudden

00:48:37.706 --> 00:48:41.512
surge, and so the general
public, one can see,

00:48:41.512 --> 00:48:44.389
suffering as a result of that.
 

00:48:44.389 --> 00:48:48.688
I wanted to mention that there
were also popular remedies that

00:48:48.688 --> 00:48:51.860
people adapted,
and especially in rural areas,

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.679
recourse to folk remedies and
magic.

00:48:54.679 --> 00:48:57.510
Onion soup was thought to be a
preventative.

00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:01.860
People stuffed salt up their
nostrils to ward off danger.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:05.764
They wore garlic around their
neck, as they had in Florence in

00:49:05.764 --> 00:49:07.619
the time of bubonic plague.
 

00:49:07.619 --> 00:49:11.751
They burned hot charcoals with
sulfur or brown sugar,

00:49:11.751 --> 00:49:15.250
to give off a reassuring
protective aroma;

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:18.289
you can recognize this too from
the plague.

00:49:18.289 --> 00:49:22.632
There were rumors that the
disease perhaps was an act of

00:49:22.632 --> 00:49:23.659
bio-terror.
 

00:49:23.659 --> 00:49:27.521
There were thoughts that there
were mysterious German agents

00:49:27.521 --> 00:49:30.730
who landed on U-boats and
started the epidemic.

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:35.887
There were suspicious too that
poisonous gases associated with

00:49:35.887 --> 00:49:40.369
the war effort had escaped and
caused the disaster.

00:49:40.369 --> 00:49:45.034
Well, I will run out of time
now, and just say that one of

00:49:45.034 --> 00:49:50.190
the things to think about then
are what are possible lessons?

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:52.789
And I just wanted to leave us
to think,

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:58.128
as we deal with our own H1N1,
and possibly whatever its

00:49:58.128 --> 00:50:02.184
successor is,
that clearly in 1918 and '19,

00:50:02.184 --> 00:50:07.478
there's a collective memory in
the public health service of the

00:50:07.478 --> 00:50:12.429
vulnerability of a society of
critically ill patients,

00:50:12.429 --> 00:50:16.170
turned away from hospitals,
that were full to bursting,

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:21.230
with no care available because
the system was overwhelmed.

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:26.853
And there's a fear then of what
about the effects now of the

00:50:26.853 --> 00:50:30.380
impact of organized care
medicine,

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:35.347
on a managed care basis,
with cost-cutting search for

00:50:35.347 --> 00:50:39.628
savings in our system;
the commitment to ridding

00:50:39.628 --> 00:50:43.210
hospitals of excess capacity and
spare beds.

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:48.269
And so this approach raises the
question of what would happen in

00:50:48.269 --> 00:50:52.929
another time when the system
might once again be tested?

00:50:52.929 --> 00:50:58.000

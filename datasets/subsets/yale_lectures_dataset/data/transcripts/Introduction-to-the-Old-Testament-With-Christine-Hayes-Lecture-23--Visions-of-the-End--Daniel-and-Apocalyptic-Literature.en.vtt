00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.692
Professor Christine
Hayes: All right,

00:00:01.692 --> 00:00:04.180
let's go ahead and get started;
there's a lot to cover.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.296
But I want to try to unite a
lot of these disparate parts of

00:00:07.296 --> 00:00:10.519
the Bible, the many small books
clustered here at the end that

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:11.840
we'll be considering.
 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.385
I'm going to try to unite them
by elaborating certain themes as

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:15.330
we move through them.
 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.518
But as you can see,
from this giant chart,

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.230
there's quite a bit.
 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.620
First, let's begin with the
Book of Ruth.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.160
The Book of Ruth is set in the
days of the Judges;

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.760
that's the opening line of the
book.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.298
It tells you that this happened
in the days of Judges,

00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:31.070
but it was certainly written
later,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.869
and whether it was post-exilic
or pre-exilic is not certain,

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:39.120
so we're going to be asking the
questions of a canonical critic.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.781
Whatever its origin,
how did this book function for

00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:44.320
Second Temple Jews?
 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.911
As the story of a foreign
woman, whose foreign status is

00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:50.850
continually emphasized
throughout the book,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.963
(Ruth the Moabite,
Ruth the Moabitess)-- as a

00:00:53.963 --> 00:00:58.349
foreign woman who acts nobly and
enters the community of Israel

00:00:58.349 --> 00:01:01.062
by choice,
this story would have stood in

00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:03.759
opposition to the negative view
of foreigners,

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:07.180
the ban on intermarriage and
the purely genealogical

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.473
definition of Israelite identity
that was promulgated by Ezra and

00:01:11.473 --> 00:01:14.090
Nehemiah in the post-exilic
period.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.789
So in the story you have a
famine in Judah and that causes

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.904
a Bethlehemite man,
Elimelech and his wife Naomi,

00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:23.629
and their two children to leave
Judah.

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:26.939
They're going to reside in the
country of Moab,

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.393
where the Moabites live,
and their two sons marry

00:01:30.393 --> 00:01:32.840
Moabite women,
Orpah and Ruth.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.308
You have to consider the effect
that these opening verses would

00:01:36.308 --> 00:01:39.330
have had on an ancient Israelite
listener or reader.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.860
Moab was a hostile neighbor on
Israel's southeastern border.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.093
And the Moabites were hated for
their ill-treatment of the

00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:50.440
Israelites when they were
traveling to the Promised Land.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.308
Their lack of hospitality had
already led to a prohibition of

00:01:53.308 --> 00:01:55.030
intermarriage in the Torah
itself.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.422
So the Moabites and Ammonites
are two foreign groups that are

00:01:58.422 --> 00:02:01.475
explicitly prohibited from
entering the congregation in

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:04.567
Deuteronomy 23.
The Israelites' low opinion of

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:08.736
the Moabites is also expressed
in Genesis in the very degrading

00:02:08.736 --> 00:02:12.973
story of Moab's descent from the
incestuous relationship between

00:02:12.973 --> 00:02:17.379
Lot and one of his daughters,
after the fall of Sodom.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.420
And yet here we read,
in the opening lines of this

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.336
story a man from Bethlehem,
who travels to Moab,

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:25.879
and his two sons marry Moabite
women!

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.242
Then in short order Elimelech
and his two sons (who are

00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:32.355
appropriately named Sickness and
Death, by the way,

00:02:32.355 --> 00:02:33.849
in Hebrew) they die.
 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.000
And the Israelite widow,
Naomi, is left now with no

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.394
blood relation,
no blood male relation,

00:02:39.394 --> 00:02:42.039
only her two Moabite
daughters-in-law.

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.580
And Naomi weepily tells the
girls that they should return to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.900
their father's home.
 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.217
She's poor, she'll never be
able to support them as a poor

00:02:50.217 --> 00:02:53.069
widow, she has no further sons
to give to them,

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.904
and clearly they have no legal
or moral obligation or tie to

00:02:57.904 --> 00:03:00.255
Naomi.
And we'll pick up the story

00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:02.914
then in chapter 1:11:
But Naomi replied,

00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:04.230
"Turn back, my daughters!
 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.710
Why should you go with me?
 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.780
Have I any more sons in my body
who might be husbands for you?

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.300
Turn back, my daughters,
for I am too old to be married.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.140
Even if I thought there was
hope for me, even if I married

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.931
tonight and I also bore sons,
should you wait for them to

00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:19.067
grow up?
Should you on their account

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:20.890
debar yourselves from marriage?
 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.229
Oh no, my daughters!
 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.401
My lot is far more bitter than
yours, for the hand of the Lord

00:03:25.401 --> 00:03:26.909
has struck out against me."
 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.889
They broke into weeping again,
and Orpah kissed her

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.380
mother-in-law farewell.
 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.440
But Ruth clung to her.
 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.434
So she said,
"See, your sister-in-law has

00:03:35.434 --> 00:03:37.330
returned to her people and her
gods.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.960
Go follow your sister-in-law."
 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.495
But Ruth replied,
"Do not urge me to leave you,

00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:43.370
to turn back and not follow
you.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.772
For wherever you go, I will go;
wherever you lodge,

00:03:46.772 --> 00:03:49.861
I will lodge;
your people shall be my people,

00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:51.340
and your God my God.
 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.681
Where you die,
I will die, and there I will be

00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:55.864
buried.
Thus and more may the Lord do

00:03:55.864 --> 00:03:58.229
to me if even death parts me
from you."

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.188
When [Naomi]
saw how determined she was to

00:04:00.188 --> 00:04:02.289
go with her, she ceased to argue
with her;

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:05.580
and the two went on until they
reached Bethlehem.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.729
All of the names in this story
are wonderfully symbolic.

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.932
Sickness and Death – it's
like they walk on the stage with

00:04:09.932 --> 00:04:12.210
a big sign saying "I'm in a bit
part and I'm ready to die."

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.416
Orpah's name means the back of
the neck because she turns her

00:04:16.416 --> 00:04:18.939
back on her mother-in-law as
well.

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:21.600
It's a wonderful story with
lots of name symbolisms.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.929
But by the force of sheer
conviction, Ruth joins herself

00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:27.170
to the people of her
mother-in-law.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.142
Back in Judah,
Ruth supports her mother-in-law

00:04:30.142 --> 00:04:33.578
and herself by gleaning the
fallen sheaves behind the

00:04:33.578 --> 00:04:35.230
reapers in the field.
 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.436
Because according to the
Pentateuch, the sheaves that

00:04:37.436 --> 00:04:40.110
fall behind the reapers must be
left for the poor to collect;

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.759
you don't go back and collect
them.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.674
So Ruth gleans,
and she gleans in the field of

00:04:44.674 --> 00:04:47.977
a kinsman named Boaz,
and he's described as a man of

00:04:47.977 --> 00:04:51.474
substance and she's very
diligent and she soon comes to

00:04:51.474 --> 00:04:54.136
his attention.
He's very kind to her,

00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:57.800
he looks out for her safety
among the rough field workers.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.529
He provides water for her.
 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.769
He's heard of what Ruth has
done for Naomi;

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:05.791
how she left her home and left
her family to come to a people

00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:08.310
that she really didn't know,
and he blesses her.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.019
He says, "May the Lord reward
your deeds.

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:12.372
May you have a full recompense
from the Lord,

00:05:12.372 --> 00:05:14.724
the God of Israel,
under whose wings you have

00:05:14.724 --> 00:05:17.420
sought refuge!"
chapter 2:12.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.769
He increases his generosity;
he shares his meal with Ruth

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:25.345
and gives her from the heaps of
grain in addition to the

00:05:25.345 --> 00:05:27.620
gleanings that she's collecting.
 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.386
So Naomi is very delighted with
Ruth's gleanings,

00:05:30.386 --> 00:05:32.750
they more than suffice for
their needs.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.626
But she's even more pleased to
learn that Ruth seems to have

00:05:36.626 --> 00:05:38.860
found favor in the eyes of Boaz.
 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.862
He's been very kind and
generous, and she points out:

00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:44.459
you know he is among our
redeeming kinsmen.

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:46.890
Now the term here,
the Hebrew term is goel.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.850
Goel means redeemer.
 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.960
In fact, in a lot of the
Christian language later,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.285
this is the word they're using
when they talk about "my

00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:54.190
redeemer liveth."
 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.235
It's simply this word
goel, and the goel

00:05:57.235 --> 00:06:00.970
is a person who as the nearest
relative or as a close relative,

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.279
has certain legal obligations
to another person.

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:08.660
Those obligations--the primary
obligations are three:

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.300
(1)To redeem the person or
their property if they've been

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.769
sold to a stranger due to
poverty.

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:17.850
So to redeem them from debt
servitude essentially.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.930
So your goel should do
that for you.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.829
(2)To marry a childless widow.
 

00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:26.244
So if a man dies and his wife
is childless the goel is

00:06:26.244 --> 00:06:28.329
supposed to marry her,
provide seed,

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:31.427
and the firstborn son will be
named after the name who is

00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:33.067
dead.
So he's supposed to marry a

00:06:33.067 --> 00:06:35.550
childless widow and produce
offspring for the deceased;

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.009
usually, that falls first to
the brother;

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:40.500
And then (3) in the case of the
blood redeemer,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.370
also the redeemer is supposed
to avenge the blood of a

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.485
kinsman.
So if you are killed your

00:06:45.485 --> 00:06:48.300
redeemer is supposed to seek
vengeance for you.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.847
Boaz is a somewhat distant
relative, but Naomi believes

00:06:51.847 --> 00:06:55.658
he's the answer to their dual
problem of poverty on the one

00:06:55.658 --> 00:06:57.863
hand,
and Ruth's widowhood on the

00:06:57.863 --> 00:07:01.481
other hand.
So in chapter 3 she urges Ruth

00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:03.899
to make a visit to Boaz.
 

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:07.180
He's winnowing barley on the
threshing floor and Ruth is

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.935
supposed to bathe herself,
anoint herself,

00:07:09.935 --> 00:07:13.769
dress up and go out at night to
the threshing floor.

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:16.776
You should know that
biblically, threshing floors

00:07:16.776 --> 00:07:20.660
tend to be places of revelry at
the end of the harvest time and

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.480
they are often frequented by
prostitutes.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.509
But Naomi seems to be planning
Ruth's seduction of Boaz.

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:32.194
She instructs Ruth not to
reveal herself until Boaz has

00:07:32.194 --> 00:07:35.759
finished eating and drinking,
and when he lies down,

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.185
Ruth is to approach him and
uncover his feet--this is

00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:42.149
possibly a sexual euphemism--and
lie down,

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:44.490
and he will tell her what she
is to do.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.960
So Ruth follows these
instructions exactly.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.905
In 3:7-11:
Boaz ate and drank,

00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:54.440
and in a cheerful mood went to
lie down beside the grainpile.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.346
Then she went over stealthily
and uncovered his feet and lay

00:07:58.346 --> 00:07:59.958
down.
In the middle of the night,

00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.639
the man gave a start and pulled
back--there was a woman lying at

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.480
his feet!
"Who are you?" he asked.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.050
And she replied,
"I am your handmaid Ruth.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.310
Spread your robe over you
handmaid, for you are a

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.300
redeeming kinsman."
 

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.708
[a goel]
He exclaimed,

00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:13.519
"Be blessed of the Lord,
daughter!

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:16.699
Your latest deed of loyalty is
greater than the first,

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:20.180
in that you have not turned to
younger men, whether poor or

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.620
rich.
And now, daughter, have no fear.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.729
I will do in your behalf
whatever you ask,

00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:27.558
for all the elders of my town
know what a fine woman you

00:08:27.558 --> 00:08:30.586
are."
So Ruth's request is that Boaz

00:08:30.586 --> 00:08:34.197
act as her redeemer and spread
his robe over her,

00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:38.110
which is a formal act of
protection and espousal.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.870
And Boaz assures her that he
will redeem her.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.495
He then goes on to point out,
however, that there is another

00:08:45.495 --> 00:08:48.200
kinsman who is actually a closer
relation,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.966
and therefore has the first
right of refusal,

00:08:50.966 --> 00:08:54.549
and Boaz will settle the matter
legally in the morning.

00:08:54.549 --> 00:08:57.580
And we're left wondering what
transpired in the night.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.437
In chapter 4 we read the legal
proceeding by which the other

00:09:01.437 --> 00:09:05.032
kinsman is freed of his
obligation and his claim to Ruth

00:09:05.032 --> 00:09:09.200
and this then clears the way,
enables Boaz to marry her.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.948
But the punchline to the whole
story is yet to come and that

00:09:12.948 --> 00:09:15.300
occurs in chapter 4,
verses 13-17,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.440
So Boaz married Ruth;
she became his wife,

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.440
and he cohabited with her.
 

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.070
The Lord let her conceive,
and she bore a son.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.674
And the women said to Naomi,
"Blessed by the Lord,

00:09:25.674 --> 00:09:28.279
who has not withheld a redeemer
from you today!

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:30.649
May his name be perpetuated in
Israel!

00:09:30.649 --> 00:09:33.500
He will renew your life and
sustain your old age;

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.412
for he is born of your
daughter-in-law,

00:09:35.412 --> 00:09:38.129
who loves you and is better to
you than seven sons."

00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:41.159
Naomi took the child and held
it to her bosom.

00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:44.098
She became its foster mother,
and the women neighbors gave

00:09:44.098 --> 00:09:46.470
him a name saying,
"A son is born to Naomi!"

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.807
They named him Obed;
he was the father of Jesse,

00:09:49.807 --> 00:09:54.083
father of David.
So David, God's anointed king

00:09:54.083 --> 00:09:57.459
over Israel;
David, with whom God covenanted

00:09:57.459 --> 00:09:59.990
that his house should reign
forever;

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.731
David, from whose line would
come the messianic king to rule

00:10:03.731 --> 00:10:07.028
in the final age--This David is
said to be the direct

00:10:07.028 --> 00:10:10.064
descendant,
the great grandson of a foreign

00:10:10.064 --> 00:10:14.032
woman from a country of idol
worshippers, and a Moabitess no

00:10:14.032 --> 00:10:16.155
less.
So it seems that this very

00:10:16.155 --> 00:10:19.632
short and very moving story
represents a strand of thought

00:10:19.632 --> 00:10:23.169
that stood in opposition to the
line of thinking found,

00:10:23.169 --> 00:10:25.787
for example,
in Ezra's call for a ban on

00:10:25.787 --> 00:10:29.679
intermarriage as the only means
of insuring faithfulness to

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:31.952
Israel's God.
Not only is Ruth,

00:10:31.952 --> 00:10:34.483
the Moabitess,
not guilty of abominable

00:10:34.483 --> 00:10:38.679
practices, she is the ancestress
of Yahweh's chosen monarch.

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:41.958
And she's praised in the story
by all who know her as a paragon

00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.944
of hesed,
this quality of steadfast love

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:48.404
and covenantal loyalty that
binds the members of the

00:10:48.404 --> 00:10:51.659
covenant community to one
another and to God.

00:10:51.659 --> 00:10:55.086
Ruth, the Moabitess,
stood by an elderly widow to

00:10:55.086 --> 00:10:59.155
whom she had no real legal
obligation and she was accepted

00:10:59.155 --> 00:11:01.440
into the covenant community.
 

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.760
The acceptance of foreigners is
well documented in post-exilic

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.372
Judaism, despite Ezra's
polemical efforts to exclude

00:11:09.372 --> 00:11:11.779
foreigners from the community.
 

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:15.272
It's important to remember that
Ezra's reforms never became

00:11:15.272 --> 00:11:17.500
normative for the entire
community.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.126
Post-exilic,
and later rabbinic Judaism,

00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:23.493
never adopted the purely
genealogical definition of

00:11:23.493 --> 00:11:26.435
Jewish identity.
They allowed for the phenomenon

00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:29.369
of conversion and marriage into
the covenant by persons of

00:11:29.369 --> 00:11:31.840
foreign birth who accepted the
God of Israel;

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.580
a possibility that Ezra
completely forecloses.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.138
Ezra's extreme views were
popular among sectarian groups,

00:11:39.138 --> 00:11:42.314
so Ezra and exclusivism is
championed, for example,

00:11:42.314 --> 00:11:44.919
in writings that are found at
Qumram.

00:11:44.919 --> 00:11:47.669
It exerted some influence on
early Christian bans on

00:11:47.669 --> 00:11:50.687
marriage, absolute bans on
marriage between believers and

00:11:50.687 --> 00:11:53.628
unbelievers,
but it's the Book of Ruth that

00:11:53.628 --> 00:11:57.508
features prominently in the
Jewish conversion ceremony to

00:11:57.508 --> 00:11:59.967
this day.
We have a different kind of

00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:03.343
acceptance of foreigners that's
voiced by prophets of the

00:12:03.343 --> 00:12:04.669
restoration period.
 

00:12:04.669 --> 00:12:10.013
So these are prophets,
fifth century--late sixth and

00:12:10.013 --> 00:12:13.929
fifth century.
We're going to look now briefly

00:12:13.929 --> 00:12:18.119
at some of the last prophetic
books, and these are writings

00:12:18.119 --> 00:12:22.237
that date to the time of the
first generations of returned

00:12:22.237 --> 00:12:24.970
exiles and on.
Earlier prophets in the

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.578
pre-exilic period--the classical
prophets we've already looked

00:12:28.578 --> 00:12:32.364
at--they had spoken of a remnant
that would be restored and would

00:12:32.364 --> 00:12:34.730
be restored gloriously to its
land,

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:39.179
but the returned exiles faced a
life of great hardship.

00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:42.317
The reality of poverty and the
difficulties in rebuilding the

00:12:42.317 --> 00:12:45.820
temple, and the hostility of the
Judeans who had remained behind,

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.423
as well as the hostility of the
surrounding peoples,

00:12:49.423 --> 00:12:53.168
the absence of any real
political independence under a

00:12:53.168 --> 00:12:56.984
Davidic King--all of these
things fell far short of the

00:12:56.984 --> 00:13:00.729
early prophets' glorious
descriptions of this restored

00:13:00.729 --> 00:13:03.436
remnant.
So new prophets in the period

00:13:03.436 --> 00:13:06.101
of the Restoration have to
address the community's

00:13:06.101 --> 00:13:08.861
disappointment.
The short Book of Haggai

00:13:08.861 --> 00:13:11.830
contains the words of the
Prophet Haggai,

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.359
spoken primarily to Zerubabbel,
(Zerubabbel is the governor of

00:13:16.359 --> 00:13:19.390
Judea).
Haggai prophesies around 520,

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.892
and he declares that all of the
difficulties the community was

00:13:23.892 --> 00:13:26.542
facing,
the agricultural setbacks and

00:13:26.542 --> 00:13:30.366
the famines, these were all
signs of God's displeasure that

00:13:30.366 --> 00:13:32.740
the temple hadn't been
completed.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.692
Zerubabbel is convinced by
this, the people return to their

00:13:36.692 --> 00:13:39.213
task enthusiastically,
and as we know,

00:13:39.213 --> 00:13:42.279
the temple is rebuilt as Haggai
promised.

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:45.931
He says it's a humble structure
but soon it's going to be filled

00:13:45.931 --> 00:13:48.539
with treasures flowing in from
all nations.

00:13:48.539 --> 00:13:51.098
And the promises of the
Restoration that were made by

00:13:51.098 --> 00:13:53.509
the prophets of old are just
around the corner.

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:56.139
So Haggai longed for a rebuilt
temple.

00:13:56.139 --> 00:13:58.914
But not only that,
also for the re-establishment

00:13:58.914 --> 00:14:01.690
of Judah's independence under a
Davidic King.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.345
And he held out hope for
Zerubabbel, the governor,

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:08.403
who was, after all,
a descendant of David,

00:14:08.403 --> 00:14:11.909
through the last king that went
into exile.

00:14:11.909 --> 00:14:14.713
He hoped that he would serve as
God's messiah,

00:14:14.713 --> 00:14:15.960
or appointed king.
 

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.553
That hope is even stronger in
the work of Haggai's

00:14:20.553 --> 00:14:22.897
contemporary,
the prophet,

00:14:22.897 --> 00:14:26.415
Zechariah.
Zechariah is 14 chapters long,

00:14:26.415 --> 00:14:30.605
and the first eight chapters
contain the prophecies of the

00:14:30.605 --> 00:14:33.620
historical Zechariah around 520
or so.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.638
The last chapters--chapters 9
through 14, this is known as

00:14:37.638 --> 00:14:42.079
Second Zechariah--these chapters
contain obscure writings from a

00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:46.450
later hand and they are of a
very different type or genre.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.582
They are written in the
apocalyptic vein,

00:14:48.582 --> 00:14:51.407
so we won't talk about those
now, we'll consider those

00:14:51.407 --> 00:14:53.551
momentarily.
I'm going to be talking about

00:14:53.551 --> 00:14:55.600
apocalyptic for the last half of
the lecture.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.906
So for right now I'm
interested, however,

00:14:57.906 --> 00:15:01.192
in the first eight chapters
which represent the oracles of

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:03.960
the historical prophet Zechariah
around 520.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.250
He preached and prophesied for
about two years.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.269
He urges in these chapters the
rebuilding of the temple.

00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:14.697
The first six chapters contain
a series of elaborate and

00:15:14.697 --> 00:15:17.502
symbolic visions,
eight different visions that

00:15:17.502 --> 00:15:20.929
are revealed by an angel and/or
a divine messenger.

00:15:20.929 --> 00:15:24.688
That's a mode of revelation
that's going to be standard in

00:15:24.688 --> 00:15:27.590
apocalyptic literature,
as we'll soon see.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.712
Earlier prophets received a
word or a vision but as we move

00:15:30.712 --> 00:15:33.620
towards apocalyptic literature
and later literature,

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:38.132
prophets often receive messages
from God through an angel or a

00:15:38.132 --> 00:15:40.991
messenger.
These visions focus hope on

00:15:40.991 --> 00:15:44.641
Zerubabbel, the governor,
and on the priest Joshua,

00:15:44.641 --> 00:15:46.539
the high priest Joshua.
 

00:15:46.539 --> 00:15:49.950
And the idea is that they'll
rule in a kind of diarchy as

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.230
monarch and priest.
 

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.426
At the same time,
however, it seems that the

00:15:54.426 --> 00:15:56.879
Persians got rid of Zerubabbel.
 

00:15:56.879 --> 00:16:01.668
He was ousted perhaps because
messianic hope was starting to

00:16:01.668 --> 00:16:03.860
gather around Zerubabbel.
 

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.868
So Zechariah's prophesies seem
to be adjusted to refer solely

00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:10.056
to Joshua.
Although they originally

00:16:10.056 --> 00:16:12.830
referred to Zerubabbel,
and although chapter 6 in

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.950
particular seems to refer
originally to Zerubabbel,

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.475
it is altered so that it now
depicts Joshua as a shoot or a

00:16:19.475 --> 00:16:22.090
branch from Jesse's
stock--Jesse's stock,

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.260
meaning a Davidide.
 

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.327
(David's father was Jesse;
so to say a root from Jesse's

00:16:26.327 --> 00:16:29.983
stock is to say a Davidide.) It
says that Joshua will rebuild

00:16:29.983 --> 00:16:32.548
the sanctuary;
he will wear the royal

00:16:32.548 --> 00:16:35.120
insignia, although he is the
priest.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.945
The elevation,
however, of the high priest is

00:16:38.945 --> 00:16:42.250
a feature of the post-exilic
period.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.125
It's a feature of Judah in the
post-exilic period,

00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:50.870
the high priest coming to take
some of the trappings of royal

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.875
office.
Chapters 7 and 8,

00:16:52.875 --> 00:16:56.415
declare God's promise to turn
and to do good things in

00:16:56.415 --> 00:16:58.820
Jerusalem and the House of
Judah,

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.200
so long as the people will turn
from their unjust and evil ways.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.688
And Zechariah points forward to
the glorious day when all the

00:17:06.688 --> 00:17:10.002
nations of the world will
eagerly come to seek the Lord in

00:17:10.002 --> 00:17:12.269
Jerusalem and to entreat his
favor.

00:17:12.269 --> 00:17:16.335
So we read in Zechariah 8:23,
"Thus said the Lord of Hosts:

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:19.350
In those days,
ten men from nations of every

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:23.486
tongue will take hold--they will
take hold of every Jew by a

00:17:23.486 --> 00:17:27.022
corner of his cloak and say,
'Let us go with you,

00:17:27.022 --> 00:17:30.132
for we have heard that God is
with you,'" and thus this

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.260
Restoration period,
you can see,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.636
features prophets who envision
other nations joining Israel in

00:17:36.636 --> 00:17:38.430
the worship of Yahweh.
 

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.820
They will come to rally around
and join Israel in the worship

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.430
of God in Jerusalem.
 

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:49.105
The last wave of prophetic
writings that we have addresses

00:17:49.105 --> 00:17:53.699
the disappointment and the
disillusionment of late sixth-

00:17:53.699 --> 00:17:56.160
and fifth-century Judeans.
 

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.460
What was the message of these
writings?

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.440
The basic message was that the
earlier prophets,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:07.605
their promises of future glory
for the restored remnant--these

00:18:07.605 --> 00:18:12.599
were all true.
The future just isn't now.

00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:16.087
It's only going to happen in
the eschaton,

00:18:16.087 --> 00:18:19.076
the final day.
Only then will the glory of

00:18:19.076 --> 00:18:23.202
Jerusalem and a messianic ruler
be restored, and the hope that

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:26.989
has to sustain the community
through the bleak present is

00:18:26.989 --> 00:18:29.559
therefore an eschatological
hope,

00:18:29.559 --> 00:18:32.776
a hope that focuses on an ideal
account of the end,

00:18:32.776 --> 00:18:35.349
(eschatology = an account of
the end).

00:18:35.349 --> 00:18:38.480
Because in the end of days
everything will be set right.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.523
So as we move later into the
period, we find increasingly the

00:18:42.523 --> 00:18:46.027
hope for the community is thrust
off into the future,

00:18:46.027 --> 00:18:47.509
in an eschatology.
 

00:18:47.509 --> 00:18:52.853
Parts of Third Isaiah depict
the bitter reality of life in

00:18:52.853 --> 00:18:57.259
post-exilic Judah and advance in
eschatology.

00:18:57.259 --> 00:19:00.004
You remember the Book of
Isaiah, which is 66 chapters,

00:19:00.004 --> 00:19:02.127
we divided into three parts:
1 through 39,

00:19:02.127 --> 00:19:05.369
which is the historical Isaiah;
then we have Second Isaiah;

00:19:05.369 --> 00:19:08.817
and then ThirdIsaiah,
we're dealing with now--that's

00:19:08.817 --> 00:19:10.170
chapters 56 to 66.
 

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:14.129
The anonymous prophetic author
of these chapters denounces the

00:19:14.129 --> 00:19:16.921
failings of the exiles,
but does hold out an

00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:19.831
eschatology;
a doctrine of final things that

00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:22.910
depicts what's going to happen
in the end of days.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:26.753
This kind of eschatology
differs from the depiction of

00:19:26.753 --> 00:19:31.539
Zion's future glory that we had
in the early classical prophets.

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:34.755
The earlier prophetic
pronouncements generally

00:19:34.755 --> 00:19:38.470
referred to a re-establishment
of Judah's fortunes in

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.158
historical time,
but eschatological works like

00:19:42.158 --> 00:19:45.430
Third Isaiah look beyond
historical time.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.675
They're looking to a time of a
new heaven and a new earth,

00:19:48.675 --> 00:19:50.839
when Judah's sins will be
forgotten.

00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:54.077
The land will become an earthly
paradise transformed,

00:19:54.077 --> 00:19:57.750
and blessed with peace and
prosperity and length of days.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.970
This is from Isaiah 65:17-25,
For behold!

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.519
I am creating
A new heaven and a new earth;

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:06.710
The former things shall not be
remembered,

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.200
They shall never come to mind.
 

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.040
Be glad, then,
and rejoice forever

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.339
In what I am creating.
 

00:20:11.339 --> 00:20:13.240
For I shall create Jerusalem as
a joy,

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.170
And her people as a delight;
...

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:19.475
Never again shall be heard there
The sounds of weeping and

00:20:19.475 --> 00:20:21.466
wailing.
No more shall there be an

00:20:21.466 --> 00:20:24.480
infant or graybeard
Who does not live out his days.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.380
He who dies at a hundred years
Shall be reckoned a youth,

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.360
And he who fails to reach a
hundred

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.750
Shall be reckoned accursed.
 

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.260
…For the days of My people
shall be

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:36.150
As long as the days of the tree,
My chosen ones shall outlive

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.579
The work of their hands.
 

00:20:37.579 --> 00:20:39.670
They shall not toil to no
purpose;

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.220
They shall not bear children
for terror,

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.470
But they shall be a people
blessed by the Lord,

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.650
And their offspring shall
remain with them.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:51.063
Before they pray, I will answer;
While they are still speaking,

00:20:51.063 --> 00:20:54.011
I will respond.
The wolf and the lamb shall

00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:57.226
graze together,
And the lion shall eat straw

00:20:57.226 --> 00:20:59.993
like the ox,
And the serpent's food shall be

00:20:59.993 --> 00:21:03.420
earth.In all My sacred mount
Nothing evil or vile shall be

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.732
done--said the Lord.
See this interesting notion of

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:09.440
a completely new,
transformed heaven and earth.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.119
The lion is vegetarian again,
the serpent no longer

00:21:12.119 --> 00:21:15.335
is--there's not this animosity
between the serpent and humans

00:21:15.335 --> 00:21:18.389
as was decreed at the end of
Genesis with the curse on the

00:21:18.389 --> 00:21:21.596
serpent.
They're going to just be eating

00:21:21.596 --> 00:21:24.369
earth and there will be no
danger.

00:21:24.369 --> 00:21:27.399
Third Isaiah also sounds this
theme of openness,

00:21:27.399 --> 00:21:30.492
reassuring foreigners and
eunuchs who have joined

00:21:30.492 --> 00:21:34.037
themselves to Yahweh that
they'll be welcome in the Holy

00:21:34.037 --> 00:21:37.260
Temple to serve God and to offer
sacrifices.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:37.950
Now, this is significant.
 

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.925
Again, remember that
Deuteronomy 23 right in the

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:44.279
heart of the Pentateuch,
bans eunuchs specifically,

00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:46.263
and certain
foreigners--Moabites,

00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:48.990
Ammonites--from entering the
congregation.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.910
Remember also that Ezekiel
explicitly excluded foreigners

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.299
from the restored temple in his
visions at the end of the book.

00:21:55.299 --> 00:21:58.420
This is also clearly the policy
of Ezra and Nehemiah.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.608
They had an Ammonite who had
his lodgings or office or room

00:22:02.608 --> 00:22:06.725
in the temple--they had him
thrown out of that area in the

00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:09.360
temple.
Third Isaiah seems to oppose

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.610
such restrictions.
 

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:15.000
Isaiah 56:3-7:
Let not the foreigner say,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.819
Who has attached himself to the
Lord,

00:22:16.819 --> 00:22:19.210
"The Lord will keep me apart
from his people";

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:22.670
And let not the eunuchs say,
"I am a withered tree."

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.765
For thus said the Lord:
"As for the eunuchs who keep My

00:22:25.765 --> 00:22:27.730
sabbaths,
Who have chosen what I desire

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.970
And hold fast to My covenant--
I will give them, in My House

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.440
And within My walls,
A monument and a name

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.930
Better than sons or daughters.
 

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.640
I will give them an everlasting
name

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.940
Which shall not perish.
 

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.392
As for the foreigners
Who attach themselves to the

00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:41.700
Lord,
To minister to Him,

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.980
And to love the name of the
Lord,

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.699
To be His servants--
All who keep the Sabbath and do

00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:47.520
not profane it,
And who hold fast to my

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.200
covenant.
…I will bring them to My

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.307
sacred mount
And let them rejoice in My

00:22:51.307 --> 00:22:53.356
house of prayer.
Their burnt offerings and

00:22:53.356 --> 00:22:56.030
sacrifices
Shall be welcome on My altar;

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.766
For My House shall be called
A house of prayer for all

00:22:58.766 --> 00:23:02.087
peoples."
So on this issue clearly the

00:23:02.087 --> 00:23:05.539
post-exilic community was quite
divided.

00:23:05.539 --> 00:23:09.322
Now, there's only one biblical
book, which pretty much in its

00:23:09.322 --> 00:23:12.601
entirety, belongs to the genre
of literature known as

00:23:12.601 --> 00:23:14.827
apocalyptic.
Not in its entirety,

00:23:14.827 --> 00:23:18.421
but it is the most significant
and through-going apocalyptic

00:23:18.421 --> 00:23:19.700
book in the Bible.
 

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.443
The term apocalyptic derives
from the Greek word

00:23:22.443 --> 00:23:23.670
apocalypsis.
 

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.649
An apocalypsis is a
revealing, so something that's

00:23:27.649 --> 00:23:29.710
apocalyptic is a revealing.
 

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:32.677
Apocalypse is a revelation of
things to come,

00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:36.522
and as apocalypses generally
predict the end of historical

00:23:36.522 --> 00:23:39.759
time and the beginning of a new
world order,

00:23:39.759 --> 00:23:42.079
they are generally concerned
with eschatology;

00:23:42.079 --> 00:23:45.940
so apocalyptic works tend to be
eschatological.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.168
That doesn't mean all
eschatological work is

00:23:49.168 --> 00:23:51.957
apocalyptic.
Apocalyptic literature within

00:23:51.957 --> 00:23:55.610
the Bible, and then much more
significantly outside the Hebrew

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.092
Bible,
is characterized by certain

00:23:58.092 --> 00:24:02.194
distinguishing features which
I've thrown up in brief note

00:24:02.194 --> 00:24:04.989
form over here.
So apocalyptic literature is

00:24:04.989 --> 00:24:07.720
always eschatological,
deals with the end of time.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.812
But to be apocalyptic a work
has to have certain kinds of

00:24:10.812 --> 00:24:13.242
features and not all
eschatologies have these

00:24:13.242 --> 00:24:15.410
features.
This is what they are.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.549
Most apocalyptic writings are
pseudonymous.

00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:21.707
They're generally attributed to
important figures of the past,

00:24:21.707 --> 00:24:23.260
Enoch or Abraham or someone.
 

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.269
 
 

00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:29.585
They tend to also feature a
revelation by a heavenly

00:24:29.585 --> 00:24:33.615
messenger, an angel who comes in
a vision or a dream to deliver

00:24:33.615 --> 00:24:35.240
some sort of message.
 

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.289
In general, the message is
highly symbolic.

00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:43.309
It's coded and often the
symbolism is quite bizarre.

00:24:43.309 --> 00:24:47.951
You'll have surreal images of
beasts and monsters and usually

00:24:47.951 --> 00:24:50.349
these depict foreign nations.
 

00:24:50.349 --> 00:24:53.349
The visions tend to be
chronological.

00:24:53.349 --> 00:24:56.275
They tend to be a systematic
chronology of past,

00:24:56.275 --> 00:25:00.259
present and future events that
represent the march of history,

00:25:00.259 --> 00:25:03.034
in coded form again,
and so it tends to require

00:25:03.034 --> 00:25:06.384
interpretation.
And that's usually given by the

00:25:06.384 --> 00:25:09.460
divine messenger,
who reveals the symbolic

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.109
chronological code.
 

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:14.454
Fourthly, apocalypses tend to
predict a series of

00:25:14.454 --> 00:25:17.179
catastrophes.
These are signs of the coming

00:25:17.179 --> 00:25:20.537
of the end, that final point in
the march of history that's

00:25:20.537 --> 00:25:23.000
being laid out.
You have motifs from ancient

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.740
myths very often used to
describe these catastrophes.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.119
I'll come back to that in a
minute.

00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:31.930
Apocalypses also tend to be
what I call morally dualistic.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:36.401
They tend to divide humankind
into two mutually exclusive

00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:39.104
groups;
the righteous which is always a

00:25:39.104 --> 00:25:40.961
tiny minority,
and the wicked,

00:25:40.961 --> 00:25:43.329
which is always the vast
majority.

00:25:43.329 --> 00:25:47.764
There's going to be some final
public judgment and the

00:25:47.764 --> 00:25:52.700
righteous will be saved and the
wicked will be destroyed.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.151
In this respect,
especially later apocalypses

00:25:55.151 --> 00:25:57.380
show the influence of Persian
thought.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.206
Persian thought is also quite
dualist in nature,

00:26:00.206 --> 00:26:03.575
with oppositions of light and
darkness, or good and evil,

00:26:03.575 --> 00:26:05.559
and life and death and so on.
 

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:08.835
So there does seem to be some
Persian influence and of course

00:26:08.835 --> 00:26:11.619
we're well into the Persian
period at this point.

00:26:11.619 --> 00:26:15.521
A sixth feature is that God
generally appears in apocalyptic

00:26:15.521 --> 00:26:17.769
literature as an enthroned king.
 

00:26:17.769 --> 00:26:20.382
He brings all of history to a
crashing end,

00:26:20.382 --> 00:26:22.560
and demonstrates his
sovereignty.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.460
He confounds the wicked;
he does all of these things at

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.832
the same time.
He confounds the wicked and

00:26:27.832 --> 00:26:30.994
establishes himself as the
sovereign and enthroned king,

00:26:30.994 --> 00:26:33.046
in control.
Seventh, apocalyptic

00:26:33.046 --> 00:26:35.603
literature, as I briefly
mentioned before,

00:26:35.603 --> 00:26:38.970
often incorporates mythological
motifs and imagery,

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:42.362
especially the motif of a
battle between God and

00:26:42.362 --> 00:26:44.599
primordial, chaotic elements.
 

00:26:44.599 --> 00:26:48.713
And that will often be the
imagery that's used in depicting

00:26:48.713 --> 00:26:52.259
the final battle with the
godless or the wicked.

00:26:52.259 --> 00:26:56.416
Apocalypses also generally
depict a judgment of the

00:26:56.416 --> 00:27:00.323
individual dead,
followed by everlasting life or

00:27:00.323 --> 00:27:03.083
punishment.
So again, apocalypses develop

00:27:03.083 --> 00:27:06.319
quite substantially outside the
writings of the Hebrew Bible;

00:27:06.319 --> 00:27:08.821
and in the Bible,
we have a few scattered

00:27:08.821 --> 00:27:12.509
apocalyptic elements and then
much of the Book of Daniel.

00:27:12.509 --> 00:27:16.602
And so we don't see the idea of
life after death really in the

00:27:16.602 --> 00:27:20.829
Hebrew Bible until this very
late apocalyptic book of Daniel.

00:27:20.829 --> 00:27:25.262
The idea is very influential in
the Dead Sea Scrolls (they are

00:27:25.262 --> 00:27:29.330
very dualist) and in the
writings of the New Testament of

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.298
course.
So a belief in personal

00:27:31.298 --> 00:27:33.991
immortality, a belief in a
general resurrection of the

00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:36.836
dead--these arise from a
negative view of this world as a

00:27:36.836 --> 00:27:38.920
place where justice can be
obtained.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.130
So apocalyptic writers examined
the world they lived in;

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:45.132
they drew the conclusion that
reward and punishment were going

00:27:45.132 --> 00:27:46.559
to be made in an afterlife.
 

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:49.155
They were certainly not doled
out in this life,

00:27:49.155 --> 00:27:50.339
as Israel suffered.
 

00:27:50.339 --> 00:27:53.945
This is a marked break from the
general conviction of the Hebrew

00:27:53.945 --> 00:27:56.750
Bible that human life is limited
to this world,

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.040
and that the fundamental
concern of humans and God is

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:03.519
morality in this life and not
immortality in another.

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:07.660
I think apocalyptic literature
can be described as a literature

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.130
of hope and despair.
 

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:12.540
It's a literature of despair or
pessimism because its basic

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.716
premise is that this world holds
out no promise for the

00:28:15.716 --> 00:28:18.489
righteous.
It's a literature of hope or

00:28:18.489 --> 00:28:22.180
optimism because it affirms that
God will intervene.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.711
He will intervene in human
history, he'll set everything

00:28:24.711 --> 00:28:26.690
right, he'll interrupt the
natural order,

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:30.108
he's going to destroy this
broken world as we know it,

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:33.397
and he'll do so in order to
rescue the righteous and

00:28:33.397 --> 00:28:36.173
humiliate the wicked,
and if you've already died

00:28:36.173 --> 00:28:37.962
don't worry there will be a
resurrection,

00:28:37.962 --> 00:28:39.259
it will all be made right.
 

00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:43.776
But this hope for supreme and
ultimate vindication is thrust

00:28:43.776 --> 00:28:45.460
off into the future.
 

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.996
So apocalyptic constitutes yet
one more response to the

00:28:49.996 --> 00:28:53.019
traumatic events,
the crises, and the

00:28:53.019 --> 00:28:56.380
disappointments of Israel's
history.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.285
In a second we'll get to
Daniel, but there are a few

00:28:59.285 --> 00:29:02.590
apocalyptic passages of varying
length in other post-exilic

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.272
books.
I'll just touch on them very

00:29:04.272 --> 00:29:06.232
quickly.
SecondZechariah and,

00:29:06.232 --> 00:29:08.636
a little bit,
the book of Joel,

00:29:08.636 --> 00:29:11.280
just to prepare us for Daniel.
 

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.720
Second Zechariah.
 

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.190
Now, these are chapters 9
through 14.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:17.492
We talked about the historical
Zechariah, chapters 1 through 8,

00:29:17.492 --> 00:29:20.582
so this is Second Zechariah,
chapters 9 through 14,

00:29:20.582 --> 00:29:23.295
and it's a collection of
diverse oracles,

00:29:23.295 --> 00:29:25.670
probably fifth-century or
later,

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:29.460
that contain these strange
visions and predictions.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.791
Their meanings cannot always be
fathomed, but they seem to focus

00:29:33.791 --> 00:29:36.926
on the Day of the Lord,
and the restoration of

00:29:36.926 --> 00:29:40.917
Jerusalem, and the rise of a new
and humble king who will reign

00:29:40.917 --> 00:29:43.980
in peace,
really over a new world order.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:49.357
Chapter 14 is a vision of this
global battle that will bring

00:29:49.357 --> 00:29:51.180
history to an end.
 

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.887
God is going to bring all the
nations to Jerusalem where they

00:29:54.887 --> 00:29:57.844
will plunder the city,
they will kill almost all of

00:29:57.844 --> 00:30:01.162
the inhabitants and then at the
last moment when things look the

00:30:01.162 --> 00:30:04.073
most desperate,
God will intervene and he'll

00:30:04.073 --> 00:30:07.650
fight for Israel and exact
revenge on her enemies.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:11.228
And it's after this final
battle that God will transform

00:30:11.228 --> 00:30:13.049
the earth into a paradise.
 

00:30:13.049 --> 00:30:16.383
So Israel's enemies will rage
against one another,

00:30:16.383 --> 00:30:19.990
the surviving nations will
pilgrimage to Jerusalem.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:22.839
Again, Jerusalem now is
elevated above all cities,

00:30:22.839 --> 00:30:26.327
and these nations will come to
Jerusalem to worship Yahweh at

00:30:26.327 --> 00:30:28.829
his temple,
and Yahweh will be sovereign

00:30:28.829 --> 00:30:32.357
over the world.
Joel, a very short little book,

00:30:32.357 --> 00:30:37.384
probably the latest prophetic
book, also contains apocalyptic

00:30:37.384 --> 00:30:39.857
material.
The versification of Joel

00:30:39.857 --> 00:30:42.967
varies tremendously in different
English translations,

00:30:42.967 --> 00:30:46.839
so I'm using the verse markings
that are in the Bible you have.

00:30:46.839 --> 00:30:49.529
But if you consult another
Bible some of them only have

00:30:49.529 --> 00:30:51.522
three chapters,
some have four--it can be

00:30:51.522 --> 00:30:54.120
confusing.
But we can divide Joel into two

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.090
parts.
Up to chapter 2,

00:30:56.090 --> 00:31:01.481
verse 27--that's the first
part, from 1:1 to 2:27 (or 1:2

00:31:01.481 --> 00:31:04.743
really).
And that contains a description

00:31:04.743 --> 00:31:06.450
of a military invasion.
 

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.579
It's symbolized by an army of
locusts.

00:31:09.579 --> 00:31:13.460
And this invasion--this army of
locusts--is interpreted as a

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.880
divine punishment that is
necessary or that must come

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.920
before the day of the Lord.
 

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:23.782
The second part of Joel which
begins in verse 28 of chapter 2

00:31:23.782 --> 00:31:28.078
is a fully apocalyptic
description of the final day of

00:31:28.078 --> 00:31:31.750
terror.
Reading from chapter 3:3-4,

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.950
Before the great and
terrible day of the Lord comes,

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.529
I will set portents in the sky
and on earth:

00:31:37.529 --> 00:31:40.519
Blood and fire,
and pillars of smoke;

00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:42.180
The sun shall be turned to
darkness

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.846
And the moon to blood.
Before the great and terrible

00:31:44.846 --> 00:31:47.880
Day of the Lord comes--but the
righteous are going to survive.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.148
This is pointed out in chapter
3:5, "But everyone who invokes

00:31:51.148 --> 00:31:53.109
the name of the Lord shall
escape;

00:31:53.109 --> 00:31:56.578
for there shall be a remnant on
Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,

00:31:56.578 --> 00:31:57.990
as the Lord promised."
 

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:02.448
As we move into chapter 4 of
Joel, the Day of the Lord is

00:32:02.448 --> 00:32:06.109
envisaged as a judgment day for
all peoples.

00:32:06.109 --> 00:32:08.305
So this is increasingly the
view of the eschaton:

00:32:08.305 --> 00:32:10.044
a final battle and also a
judgment day,

00:32:10.044 --> 00:32:12.559
and that judgment day will then
issue in a new age.

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:16.195
This is an idea that the book
of Daniel will elaborate on in a

00:32:16.195 --> 00:32:19.472
minute, not to mention the
apocalyptic writings that are

00:32:19.472 --> 00:32:21.380
outside of the Hebrew Bible.
 

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.582
In this judgment day,
God will summon all of the

00:32:24.582 --> 00:32:27.579
godless nations to the valley of
judgment,

00:32:27.579 --> 00:32:31.280
Jehosaphat which means "God
will judge", so the Valley of

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.746
Jehosaphat.
And here the final battle

00:32:33.746 --> 00:32:37.474
between good and evil will take
place, and after that God's

00:32:37.474 --> 00:32:41.074
people will be blessed and the
Holy City will never again

00:32:41.074 --> 00:32:43.000
suffer shame.:
For lo!

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.660
in those days
And in that time,

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.180
When I restore the fortunes
Of Judah and Jerusalem,

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.693
I will gather all the nations
And bring them down to the

00:32:49.693 --> 00:32:52.470
Valley of Jehosaphat,
There I will contend with them

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:56.073
Over My very own people, Israel,
Which they scattered among the

00:32:56.073 --> 00:32:57.799
nations.
Towards the end,

00:32:57.799 --> 00:33:00.615
then, of the book we read,
Let the nations rouse

00:33:00.615 --> 00:33:03.050
themselves and march up
To the Valley of Jehosaphat;

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:06.120
For there I will sit in judgment
Over all the nations roundabout.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.930
Swing the sickle,
For the crop is ripe;

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.330
Come and tread,
For the winepress is full,

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.740
The vats are overflowing!
 

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:13.800
For great is their wickedness.
 

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.880
…
But the Lord will be a shelter

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.501
to His people,
A refuge to the children of

00:33:17.501 --> 00:33:18.750
Israel.
…

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:22.002
And Jerusalem shall be holy;
Nevermore shall strangers pass

00:33:22.002 --> 00:33:23.660
through it.
And in that day,

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.640
The mountains shall drip with
wine,

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.929
The hills shall flow with milk,
And all the watercourses of

00:33:28.929 --> 00:33:31.938
Judah shall flow with water;
A spring shall issue from the

00:33:31.938 --> 00:33:33.920
House of the Lord
And shall water the Wadi of

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.119
Acacias.
…

00:33:35.119 --> 00:33:36.789
But Judah shall be inhabited
forever,

00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:39.220
And Jerusalem throughout the
ages.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.444
So we see a lot of
eschatological features in the

00:33:41.444 --> 00:33:43.237
Book of Joel.
You have, first of all,

00:33:43.237 --> 00:33:46.186
the series of disasters;
they signal the impending wrath

00:33:46.186 --> 00:33:48.923
of God.
You have a cosmic battle in

00:33:48.923 --> 00:33:52.559
which Yahweh triumphs over
Israel's enemy.

00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:55.773
And we see in apocalyptic
literature in general,

00:33:55.773 --> 00:33:59.397
a facile equation of the
righteous and the wicked with

00:33:59.397 --> 00:34:01.380
Israel and other nations.
 

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.829
Then also we have this
outpouring of blessings on God's

00:34:05.829 --> 00:34:07.890
people, city,
and land.

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:10.885
And finally,
God's continued protection and

00:34:10.885 --> 00:34:13.071
presence;
and nations who are not

00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:16.482
Israel's enemies join in the
worship of God in that final

00:34:16.482 --> 00:34:18.562
time.
Again, note the important

00:34:18.562 --> 00:34:22.128
difference between classical
prophecy and the apocalyptic

00:34:22.128 --> 00:34:24.646
literature.
Both of them speak about final

00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:26.481
things;
both of them speak about an

00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:28.844
end-time.
But the classical prophets did

00:34:28.844 --> 00:34:32.473
not in general expect that the
course of human affairs would

00:34:32.473 --> 00:34:35.251
come to an end.
Only that Israel's rebellion

00:34:35.251 --> 00:34:38.535
would end or that Israel would
live under a perfect king

00:34:38.535 --> 00:34:41.560
anointed by God.
In the apocalyptic imagination

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.829
history itself is a closed
process;

00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:46.211
it will end,
and then a new age,

00:34:46.211 --> 00:34:48.670
a new world order would begin.
 

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:52.699
And the present age and the new
age are qualitatively distinct.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:56.329
The present age is under the
dominion of evil powers.

00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:59.447
We see it particularly in the
apocalyptic writings outside of

00:34:59.447 --> 00:35:01.369
the Bible and in the New
Testament.

00:35:01.369 --> 00:35:04.700
That power that has dominion
over the present age is Satan.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.769
Satan is the arch enemy of God.
 

00:35:06.769 --> 00:35:11.020
The age to come will be free of
all evil, moral corruption,

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.320
and death;
Satan will be defeated.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.019
But God himself is the one who
has to do this.

00:35:15.019 --> 00:35:19.164
God must intervene to bring the
present age to a crashing halt

00:35:19.164 --> 00:35:21.610
and initiate this new world
order.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:26.000
So let's turn now to Daniel for
a full apocalyptic work.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.996
Daniel also can be divided
really into two parts and the

00:35:29.996 --> 00:35:33.847
first six chapters have often
been described as heroic

00:35:33.847 --> 00:35:36.128
fiction.
They're a bit like the book of

00:35:36.128 --> 00:35:38.430
Esther that we'll be talking
about on Wednesday.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.179
Just a good story.
 

00:35:40.179 --> 00:35:42.838
(Esther particularly has a lot
or irony and is very,

00:35:42.838 --> 00:35:45.079
very funny.) But like the book
of Esther,

00:35:45.079 --> 00:35:49.139
Daniel features a Jew who lives
in a Gentile court and he's

00:35:49.139 --> 00:35:50.679
saved from disaster.
 

00:35:50.679 --> 00:35:54.320
I've listed the kings who are
discussed in the Book of Daniel.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:59.071
These chapters tell of Daniel's
adventures under two Babylonian

00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:02.059
kings, Nebuchadnezzar and
Belshazzar;

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:04.491
the text says two
Babylonian kings,

00:36:04.491 --> 00:36:08.281
Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar;
a Median king Darius who

00:36:08.281 --> 00:36:11.985
happens to be unknown to
history, a Persian king

00:36:11.985 --> 00:36:14.980
Cyrus--that's a whole lot of
years!

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.500
The historical inaccuracy of
the work, right?

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.222
You have the chronology of more
than a century being telescoped

00:36:21.222 --> 00:36:23.579
here!
There're other inaccuracies.

00:36:23.579 --> 00:36:25.680
Belshazzar was actually never a
king;

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.519
he was sort of a prince regent.
 

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:29.681
He was defeated by Cyrus,
not by Darius,

00:36:29.681 --> 00:36:32.730
so there are tremendous
historical inaccuracies and this

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:35.889
is a sign that this was written
at a much later time,

00:36:35.889 --> 00:36:39.228
looking back when the history
of a period 300 years ago was

00:36:39.228 --> 00:36:42.637
very confused.
There's no clear historical

00:36:42.637 --> 00:36:47.059
knowledge of the Babylonian and
Persian period.

00:36:47.059 --> 00:36:49.960
So the book,
we know, was written quite

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.166
late, perhaps the end of the
third century,

00:36:53.166 --> 00:36:55.380
those first six chapters.
 

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.110
We have a better idea about the
remainder of the book.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:02.110
Chapters 7 through 12 are fully
apocalyptic in genre and they

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:05.909
were composed between 167 and
164--I don't know if I wrote

00:37:05.909 --> 00:37:10.130
that up there,
yeah, 167 and 164 BCE.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:15.246
This was a time when Jews were
suffering intense persecution at

00:37:15.246 --> 00:37:20.197
the hands of the Seleucid King
of Syria, Antiochus Epiphanes,

00:37:20.197 --> 00:37:23.973
Antiochus IV.
And so Daniel is the latest

00:37:23.973 --> 00:37:26.260
book of the Hebrew Bible.
 

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:30.738
It was chronologically the
latest book, written between 167

00:37:30.738 --> 00:37:33.820
and 164 BCE.
But the author writes in code.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.595
He writes in code so that some
hostile person would not be able

00:37:37.595 --> 00:37:40.700
to understand.
The author disguises his

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.872
references to contemporary
historical events and

00:37:44.872 --> 00:37:50.348
personalities in these visions,
these symbolic visions that are

00:37:50.348 --> 00:37:53.519
attributed to a remote era of
the past.

00:37:53.519 --> 00:37:57.179
Let's go back and look at the
contents of these two sections.

00:37:57.179 --> 00:38:00.432
In chapters 1 through 6,
Daniel is represented as a

00:38:00.432 --> 00:38:03.750
loyal Jew who's living in the
exile in Babylonia,

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.639
sixth-century exilic period
among idol worshippers.

00:38:07.639 --> 00:38:11.329
He refuses to bow down to any
other god.

00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:16.179
He observes the dietary laws
and he prays facing Jerusalem.

00:38:16.179 --> 00:38:20.380
He seems to occupy a position
of some honor in the court.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.981
He has the power to interpret
dreams and to predict the

00:38:23.981 --> 00:38:27.717
future, and although he's
severely tested he remains true

00:38:27.717 --> 00:38:31.919
to Yahweh and Yahweh aids him in
more than one miraculous escape

00:38:31.919 --> 00:38:35.266
from danger.
The main themes of this first

00:38:35.266 --> 00:38:39.706
section of the book of Daniel
are Daniel's interpretations of

00:38:39.706 --> 00:38:43.331
the dreams of these kings
(Nebuchadnezzar) and his

00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:45.329
allegiance to his God.
 

00:38:45.329 --> 00:38:48.700
In chapter 2,
Nebuchadnezzar has a dream of a

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.249
huge statute.
It has a head of gold,

00:38:51.249 --> 00:38:55.193
has a torso and arms of silver,
the belly and the thighs are of

00:38:55.193 --> 00:38:56.849
bronze,
the legs are of iron,

00:38:56.849 --> 00:38:58.840
and the feet are of mixed iron
and clay.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.211
I've kind of given you a little
grid and in a minute we're going

00:39:02.211 --> 00:39:05.422
to have another symbolic dream
that's going to use animals to

00:39:05.422 --> 00:39:08.580
represent the same things that
are being represented here by

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.152
the metals.
So you have this statue with

00:39:11.152 --> 00:39:13.349
these metals and iron and clay
feet.

00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:18.581
Then a great stone that's uncut
by human hands flies from heaven

00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:22.070
and smashes the clay feet of the
statue,

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:26.583
and the statue crumbles and
this stone becomes a mountain

00:39:26.583 --> 00:39:28.760
that fills all the earth.
 

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.050
Daniel decodes the dream's
symbolism;

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:35.420
and it's a historical
symbolism, the march of history.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:39.096
Each metal represents a kingdom
that ruled the Ancient Near

00:39:39.096 --> 00:39:41.628
East.
Daniel only explicitly mentions

00:39:41.628 --> 00:39:44.929
gold as Babylon,
but we can figure out the rest.

00:39:44.929 --> 00:39:47.184
Silver is Media,
bronze is Persia,

00:39:47.184 --> 00:39:51.282
and iron is Alexander's Greece,
right, Macedonian Greece that

00:39:51.282 --> 00:39:54.630
conquered the Ancient Near East
in the 330's,

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:57.870
and brought Hellenism,
and introduced the Hellenistic

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.550
period into Ancient Near Eastern
history.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:04.275
After Alexander's death,
his empire was divided into

00:40:04.275 --> 00:40:06.539
smaller Hellenistic kingdoms.
 

00:40:06.539 --> 00:40:10.708
The ones of greatest relevance
to us are Ptolemaic Egypt and

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:14.947
Seleucid Syria because as you
can imagine Palestine is caught

00:40:14.947 --> 00:40:17.420
between those two great powers.
 

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.650
So it's going to be fought over
by those two great powers.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:23.289
So you have Egypt ruled by the
Ptolemies;

00:40:23.289 --> 00:40:25.190
you have Syria ruled by the
Seleucids;

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:28.208
they're wrangling for control
of the land of Israel that's

00:40:28.208 --> 00:40:29.320
lying between them.
 

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.704
So the iron and clay feet of
the statue in Daniel's dream

00:40:32.704 --> 00:40:35.786
represent these lesser
Hellenistic kingdoms of Egypt

00:40:35.786 --> 00:40:39.171
and Syria that succeeded
Alexander's empire and are a mix

00:40:39.171 --> 00:40:41.710
of Hellenistic and Eastern
elements.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.701
The stone from heaven
represents the future kingdom of

00:40:44.701 --> 00:40:46.816
God.
It's going to come and destroy

00:40:46.816 --> 00:40:50.250
these godless kingdoms and fill
all of the earth forever.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:54.377
Chapter 3 tells the story of
Daniel's three companions who

00:40:54.377 --> 00:40:58.722
refuse to worship a giant gold
statue and they get themselves

00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:01.039
thrown into a fiery furnace.
 

00:41:01.039 --> 00:41:05.145
When they emerge unscathed the
king is greatly impressed and so

00:41:05.145 --> 00:41:07.530
he acknowledges the God of
Israel.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.329
In chapter 4 there's a second
dream.

00:41:09.329 --> 00:41:13.294
It's interpreted by Daniel as a
sign that Nebuchadnezzar will be

00:41:13.294 --> 00:41:14.929
struck down seven times.
 

00:41:14.929 --> 00:41:18.611
He's going to lose his reason,
he's going to lose his throne,

00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:22.108
until he realizes that God is
the source of all divine and

00:41:22.108 --> 00:41:24.814
human power.
When this in fact comes to

00:41:24.814 --> 00:41:28.661
pass--Nebuchadnezzar seems to
suffer a fit of insanity that

00:41:28.661 --> 00:41:32.507
drives him from society--the
king then praises the God most

00:41:32.507 --> 00:41:34.630
high as the universal king.
 

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:37.848
In chapter 5,
Daniel's enemies at court trick

00:41:37.848 --> 00:41:41.945
the Median king (now Darius,
so we're moving to different

00:41:41.945 --> 00:41:44.662
kings).
They trick him into issuing an

00:41:44.662 --> 00:41:48.040
edict against those who pray to
anyone but the king.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.769
This is a problem for Daniel.
 

00:41:49.769 --> 00:41:52.428
Daniel violates the edict,
of course, and he's arrested

00:41:52.428 --> 00:41:54.300
and he's thrown into a den of
lions.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.880
But he emerges unharmed,
and the result is,

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.320
again, that the foreign king,
in this case Darius now,

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:04.457
recognizes the supremacy of
Yahweh and orders all in his

00:42:04.457 --> 00:42:07.090
kingdom to revere the Jewish
God.

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:10.299
There is, of course,
no historical merit to these

00:42:10.299 --> 00:42:13.977
stories of Babylonian and
Persian kings acknowledging or

00:42:13.977 --> 00:42:18.190
adopting the God of the Jews who
lived in exile among them.

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:22.231
These stories seem to give
voice to the hope or the fantasy

00:42:22.231 --> 00:42:26.343
that a cruel and impious monarch
might be taught humility by

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:29.225
Yahweh.
They also provide a model for

00:42:29.225 --> 00:42:30.829
life in the Diaspora.
 

00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:35.440
Jews can live in the Gentile
world but they must never forget

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.900
God and his laws.
 

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.252
Then we move into the second
half of the Book of Daniel,

00:42:40.252 --> 00:42:41.409
chapters 7 to 12.
 

00:42:41.409 --> 00:42:46.123
As we move into this part of
Daniel we switch from the third

00:42:46.123 --> 00:42:50.162
person into the first person,
so Daniel 7 to 12 is written in

00:42:50.162 --> 00:42:52.429
the first person and it's fully
apocalyptic.

00:42:52.429 --> 00:42:55.965
Here Daniel has a series of
visions and dreams that are

00:42:55.965 --> 00:42:59.827
interpreted for him by an angel,
and again, that's a classic

00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:02.250
feature of the apocalyptic
genre.

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:05.377
And these visions,
again, survey Ancient Near

00:43:05.377 --> 00:43:09.429
Eastern history from the sixth
to the second centuries.

00:43:09.429 --> 00:43:12.484
Chapter 7 again represents the
succession of kingdoms,

00:43:12.484 --> 00:43:14.732
the Babylonian,
the Median, the Persian,

00:43:14.732 --> 00:43:17.730
the Macedonian Empires,
but this time as beasts.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:22.037
So you have a lion,
a bear, a winged leopard and an

00:43:22.037 --> 00:43:24.326
ogre.
The ogre has horns and the

00:43:24.326 --> 00:43:27.505
horns of this ogre then
represent these two lesser

00:43:27.505 --> 00:43:30.813
Hellenistic kingdoms,
the Ptolemies of Egypt and the

00:43:30.813 --> 00:43:32.369
Seleucids of Syria.
 

00:43:32.369 --> 00:43:36.765
The boastful little horn is the
Syrian king, Antiochus

00:43:36.765 --> 00:43:38.590
Epiphanies, himself.
 

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:42.135
In a second vision,
the "ancient of days,"--this is

00:43:42.135 --> 00:43:45.680
the term that's used,
it seems to be God in a white

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.510
robe and a beard seated on a
fiery chariot throne,

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:54.543
but--"the ancient of days"
confers glory and kingship on

00:43:54.543 --> 00:43:56.739
one like a Son of Man.
 

00:43:56.739 --> 00:43:58.538
Now in Daniel,
this phrase,

00:43:58.538 --> 00:44:02.480
the Son of Man--which generally
means mortal as opposed to

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.875
divine in the Bible,
but--in Daniel the phrase seems

00:44:05.875 --> 00:44:09.066
to refer to a figure that's in
human form, but more than a

00:44:09.066 --> 00:44:11.634
human.
Probably an angel like Michael

00:44:11.634 --> 00:44:14.473
or Gabriel.
(Both of them are represented

00:44:14.473 --> 00:44:18.637
as leaders against the forces of
Persia and Greece.) And this

00:44:18.637 --> 00:44:22.178
figure establishes an
everlasting kingdom to replace

00:44:22.178 --> 00:44:25.510
the bestial kingdoms that have
preceded it.

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:29.495
So the Son of Man overwhelms
the little horn Antiochus,

00:44:29.495 --> 00:44:34.071
who is said to be making war on
saints (that's a code for loyal

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:36.826
Jews),
who is said to have been trying

00:44:36.826 --> 00:44:40.925
to change their law and abolish
their religion--and we know that

00:44:40.925 --> 00:44:44.244
these were parts of the
persecution in 167 to 164 by

00:44:44.244 --> 00:44:48.254
Antiochus.
He tried to stop worship in the

00:44:48.254 --> 00:44:50.309
sanctuary and so on.
 

00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:53.491
In a third vision then,
the horn that represents

00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:57.619
Antiochus is said to trample the
land of splendor (Israel),

00:44:57.619 --> 00:45:01.033
to challenge the army of
heaven, to remove the perpetual

00:45:01.033 --> 00:45:04.694
sacrifice (Antiochus did halt
the sacrificial service in the

00:45:04.694 --> 00:45:08.045
temple) and to set up an
"abomination of desolation" on

00:45:08.045 --> 00:45:11.768
the sacrificial altar (and we
know that Antiochus set up some

00:45:11.768 --> 00:45:15.306
kind of pagan altar on the
sacrificial altar in the temple

00:45:15.306 --> 00:45:18.222
in Jerusalem and erected a
statue of Zeus in the

00:45:18.222 --> 00:45:21.376
sanctuary).
So this depiction of the

00:45:21.376 --> 00:45:24.614
persecution under Antiochus is
presented here,

00:45:24.614 --> 00:45:28.860
but it's presented in veiled
form for reasons of safety.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:32.690
In chapter 9 we have a moving
prayer for deliverance.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:36.222
The Angel Gabriel assures
Daniel that the end is near,

00:45:36.222 --> 00:45:39.821
and that the end was even
predicted by Jeremiah who had

00:45:39.821 --> 00:45:43.220
said that Jerusalem would lie
desolate 70years,

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.236
you will recall.
Now, Jeremiah prophesied--I'm

00:45:46.236 --> 00:45:49.289
going to do some math now,
so this is dangerous.

00:45:49.289 --> 00:45:52.324
Jeremiah prophesied in the
early sixth century and the

00:45:52.324 --> 00:45:55.301
chapters of Daniel were written
many centuries later,

00:45:55.301 --> 00:45:57.820
someone can figure it out,
in the 160's.

00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:01.322
So was Jeremiah prophesying
falsely when he said that God

00:46:01.322 --> 00:46:05.076
would deliver Israel from her
enemies and establish a kingdom

00:46:05.076 --> 00:46:06.639
in Judah in 70 years?
 

00:46:06.639 --> 00:46:10.069
No, not according to the book
of Daniel, because in the book

00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:13.266
of Daniel it's said that
Jeremiah also was speaking in a

00:46:13.266 --> 00:46:16.040
code.
Jeremiah meant that 70 weeks of

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.961
years, which is to say 490
years, would pass before the

00:46:19.961 --> 00:46:22.139
consummation of all things.
 

00:46:22.139 --> 00:46:26.474
And the last week was the reign
Antiochus Epiphanes:

00:46:26.474 --> 00:46:30.300
we are in the last week of
these years now.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.653
So the writer is maintaining
that he is living in the last

00:46:33.653 --> 00:46:36.889
days, in the final moments of
the last week of years,

00:46:36.889 --> 00:46:39.800
and this is very typical of
apocalyptic literature.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.206
The time is at hand,
we are in the final stage,

00:46:42.206 --> 00:46:44.769
this is now all the birth pangs
of the Messiah,

00:46:44.769 --> 00:46:47.341
these terrible things that are
being visited upon us,

00:46:47.341 --> 00:46:50.307
and God is soon going to win
victory through a mighty act and

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:56.346
introduce the Messianic Age,
ending Israel's long years of

00:46:56.346 --> 00:47:00.148
desolation.
So apocalyptic literature sees

00:47:00.148 --> 00:47:01.650
history as determined.
 

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:04.725
It's a closed drama that must
be played out,

00:47:04.725 --> 00:47:08.731
requiring no action on the part
of humans except faithful

00:47:08.731 --> 00:47:11.257
waiting.
God's kingdom will come solely

00:47:11.257 --> 00:47:13.646
by God's power,
but it has to be preceded by

00:47:13.646 --> 00:47:14.980
this time of trouble.
 

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:18.376
These troubles are nothing but
the birth pangs of the Messianic

00:47:18.376 --> 00:47:21.828
Age and the faithful whose names
are recorded in God's book will

00:47:21.828 --> 00:47:24.059
be rescued.
Chapter 12 imagines a

00:47:24.059 --> 00:47:28.021
resurrection of the dead as a
compensation to those who died

00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:30.639
under the persecutions of
Antiochus.

00:47:30.639 --> 00:47:33.620
It's a clear attempt to deal
with the injustice that mars

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.387
this world, and it's the only
passage of the Bible to

00:47:36.387 --> 00:47:39.900
explicitly espouse the idea of
an individual life after death,

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.325
and as I say,
breaks with a longer Israelite

00:47:42.325 --> 00:47:45.090
tradition that's vague or silent
on this issue.

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:48.350
Not all Jews accepted the idea,
but it would be essential to

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:51.168
the rise of Christianity which
is deeply indebted to

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:52.550
apocalyptic thinking.
 

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:55.658
And through Christianity,
it came to have a very

00:47:55.658 --> 00:47:58.699
far-reaching impact on Western
civilization.

00:47:58.699 --> 00:48:02.765
The Book of Daniel is a
response to specific historical

00:48:02.765 --> 00:48:05.663
circumstances.
It's a response to the crisis

00:48:05.663 --> 00:48:09.107
of persecution and martyrdom
that was going on in the second

00:48:09.107 --> 00:48:11.603
century.
That was a new kind of crisis

00:48:11.603 --> 00:48:15.056
that led to a new kind of
response, because the earlier

00:48:15.056 --> 00:48:18.828
crises of 722 and 586--they
could be explained as punishment

00:48:18.828 --> 00:48:20.809
for sin and faithlessness.
 

00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:24.014
But now in the second century,
Jews were dying not because

00:48:24.014 --> 00:48:26.825
they were faithless but
precisely because they were

00:48:26.825 --> 00:48:29.495
faithful;
because they refused to obey

00:48:29.495 --> 00:48:32.863
the decrees of Antiochus and to
violate their law and covenant

00:48:32.863 --> 00:48:34.519
and they were dying.
 

00:48:34.519 --> 00:48:38.148
So this new phenomenon of
martyrdom, really for the first

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:42.101
time, required new responses and
the book of Daniel provides a

00:48:42.101 --> 00:48:44.110
fully apocalyptic response.
 

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:45.764
Remain faithful,
wait, Daniel urges,

00:48:45.764 --> 00:48:47.940
know that this will all be set
right by God,

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:52.064
not in this world but in an
ultimate and cataclysmic triumph

00:48:52.064 --> 00:48:54.860
of life and faith over death and
evil,

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:56.630
and it will be soon.
 

00:48:56.630 --> 00:49:00.031
Daniel emphasizes God's firm
control of history and so

00:49:00.031 --> 00:49:03.368
bolsters loyal Jews who are
suffering indignities and

00:49:03.368 --> 00:49:06.769
torture and even death all
around him because of their

00:49:06.769 --> 00:49:09.205
faith.
So we've seen the zealous

00:49:09.205 --> 00:49:13.001
fifth-century response of Ezra
and Nehemiah to the fateful

00:49:13.001 --> 00:49:15.000
events of Israel's history.
 

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.280
They believed Israel's
rededication to God and the

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.690
covenant involved as a first
step,

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:23.295
cessation of intimate relations
with foreigners,

00:49:23.295 --> 00:49:25.789
separation from their
abominable practices.

00:49:25.789 --> 00:49:28.757
We've seen very different views
that would integrate foreigners

00:49:28.757 --> 00:49:30.050
in the worship of Yahweh.
 

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:33.460
We've seen also the later
emergence of apocalyptic as an

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:37.056
expression of present despair
and future hope that entailed

00:49:37.056 --> 00:49:40.838
the divinely orchestrated and
cataclysmic defeat of the wicked

00:49:40.838 --> 00:49:43.070
enemies who persecuted Israel.
 

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:45.518
And in the last lecture we're
going to look at two books of

00:49:45.518 --> 00:49:47.840
the Hebrew Bible that take very
different approaches,

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.000
the Book of Esther and the Book
of Jonah.

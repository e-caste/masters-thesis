00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:06.467
PAUL FREEDMAN: We are
starting to use primary

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:12.300
sources for our understanding
of the historical periods

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.200
under discussion.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.767
Primary sources?

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:17.633
Writings by people who
lived at the time.

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:22.467
And as with all such sources,
the great advantage is

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.600
vividness, immediacy--

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.067
the people lived through it.

00:00:28.067 --> 00:00:33.633
And the problem is distance
from us and strangeness.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:37.300
Procopius and Gregory of Tours,
who we'll be starting

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.000
out with next week, are very
different writers.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.667
Procopius much more conscious
of style, a layman was

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:54.367
somebody operating within
the classical tradition.

00:00:54.367 --> 00:01:01.433
Gregory of Tours, certainly
a person for whom

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:03.767
style is not paramount.

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:09.467
Or at least, it's not the
classical notions of rhetoric,

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:15.733
smoothness, and vividness
that Procopius has.

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.500
He is a bishop.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.267
He's very concerned
with supernatural

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:22.500
events and the Church.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.633
Or let's say, supernatural
events

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:26.167
controlled by the Church.

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:29.133
Procopius, as you've seen, is
not very concerned with

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.667
Christianity, and the
supernatural events that

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:35.500
concerned him, such as Justinian
walking around the

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.133
palace with no head, are not
Christian supernatural.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:46.667
They're from some other older
supernatural tradition.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:52.767
But both Gregory of Tours and
Procopius require an effort to

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:54.200
figure out.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.467
Why not just read something by
a writer, a historian living

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.800
now who may be easier
to figure out?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.767
And who is writing with
you and me in mind?

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:10.367
Because of the vividness and
because of the trickiness of

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:13.700
trying to reconstruct not only
what happened, which is hard

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.900
enough, but also what the mood
of people was, and what the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.667
reaction was.

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:21.667
We're talking about
Justinian today.

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:34.067
So an emperor whose rule
occupies most of the sixth

00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:40.100
century, 527 to 565.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.733
So we're concentrating on the
sixth century as part of this

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:49.333
overall survival and crisis of
the Eastern Roman Empire.

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:53.000
His reign, or more precisely,
the earlier part of his reign

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.433
until about 540, is the height,
apogee, maximum power

00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:06.233
of this empire which succeeds in
shall we say, reconquering

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:07.567
or conquering.

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:12.300
Taking back or adding the parts
of the Western Roman

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.400
Empire, many parts of the
Western Roman Empire that had

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.967
been lost effectively to the
barbarian invasions of the

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:20.767
fifth century.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:25.767
If you still can refer to your
map, or if your memory of

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:26.700
geography is--

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.833
OK.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:33.367
The major areas of conquest of
Justinian beyond the borders

00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:39.267
of the old eastern empire are
first North Africa-- this is

00:03:39.267 --> 00:03:47.400
the coast of modern Libya,
Tunisia, Algeria, and even

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:56.467
Morocco, held by the Vandals and
seized by Justinian; parts

00:03:56.467 --> 00:04:01.167
of Spain, coastal Spain,
Mediterranean Spain, held by

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:07.733
the Visigoths; and Italy,
held by the Ostrogoths.

00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:15.333
This is the centerpiece
of Justinian's reign.

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:21.367
And for a time, it looked
as if he had, in effect,

00:04:21.367 --> 00:04:25.567
recreated the empire of
Constantine and Diocletian.

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:36.667
But as we'll see, this is a
triumph with a terrible price.

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:40.100
The terrible price being that
it weakened Byzantium.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.667
Now when we say of figures in
the past, or even figures in

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:49.400
the recent past, that their
policies were a mistake

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.133
because it turned out that
the future enemy would be

00:04:56.133 --> 00:04:59.067
something other than what they
were fighting, we can say that

00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:01.267
with the advantage of
being able to see

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:02.500
what was going happen.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.467
In other words, there are people
who argue that the

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:09.900
invasion of Iraq was a folly
or that the expenditures on

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.367
the aggressive foreign policy
of the first years of the

00:05:14.367 --> 00:05:18.033
twenty-first century was
foolish, because as it turns

00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:22.433
out, economic problems,
domestic problems, the

00:05:22.433 --> 00:05:26.200
mortgage bubble, was really the
problem that people should

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.867
have been addressing.

00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:29.867
Or they should have been
addressing the deficit.

00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:31.867
You can say that.

00:05:31.867 --> 00:05:33.700
In its own way, it's a fact.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.700
But it doesn't necessarily tell
you what people at the

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.700
time should have thought of.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.267
Thus, we know from last lecture
that, first of all,

00:05:45.267 --> 00:05:48.567
Justinian should have
concentrated on the Persians.

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:51.533
The Persians on his eastern
frontier who didn't interest

00:05:51.533 --> 00:05:55.900
him, who he just wanted to sort
of pacify in order to go

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.933
west and make his conquests.

00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:00.200
The Persians would turn
out to be the biggest

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.033
enemy of the Empire.

00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:07.433
And so, you know if you were
plotting this out as a kind of

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:13.667
international political
strategy, you could say:

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:16.000
"Forget about the Ostrogoths.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.667
Forget about the Vandals.

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:19.333
Build up that frontier.

00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:23.433
Invade Persia, keep your army
there." And indeed, with a

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:28.300
little more hindsight, we can
say, "Oh my gosh, in eighty

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.433
years, the Muslims are going
to take the eastern part of

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.400
your empire."

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.700
Well, obviously, there's no way
he is going to be expected

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.200
reasonably to know that.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.100
Except, if you're looking at
a distance, from over 1,000

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.133
years, 1,500 years.

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:48.967
Then we can say, sure, the
eastern frontier turns out to

00:06:48.967 --> 00:06:52.233
be the point of vulnerability.

00:06:52.233 --> 00:06:58.000
So a classic kind of historical
problem, or early

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.400
Middle Ages midterm question is:
"Justinian, overreacher or

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:14.967
reasonable guy?" Or "The
conquest of the west: folly or

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:18.333
grandeur?" And it's both.

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:23.633
It is a classic example of
over-extension, over-extension

00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:28.133
of empires, meaning that empires
weaken themselves at

00:07:28.133 --> 00:07:32.367
some point fatally by simply
getting either too big or

00:07:32.367 --> 00:07:34.467
spending too much money.

00:07:34.467 --> 00:07:35.300
And the two are linked.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.967
If you get too big, you
have to spend more

00:07:36.967 --> 00:07:38.367
money to defend yourself.

00:07:38.367 --> 00:07:42.900
Not really having the resources
to keep what you

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.400
have.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:50.133
The British Empire, to take a
reasonably clear and neutral

00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:55.900
example, at some point is
simply too large for the

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.500
resources of a weakened
Great Britain.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:07.367
And our colleague Paul Kennedy
has explored, quite memorably,

00:08:07.367 --> 00:08:12.933
empires that simply could not
maintain their commitments.

00:08:12.933 --> 00:08:18.600
The Spanish Empire, the British
Empire, and, as it

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.633
turned out after Kennedy
wrote his book, the

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:23.000
Russian Soviet Empire.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.933
This is a pattern in history
that repeats itself.

00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:35.300
The question, however, is, under
the circumstances, and

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.700
assuming the existence of that
empire, what are reasonable

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.700
policies to preserve
it or to extend it?

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.700
We know about Justinian's wars
of conquest and of defense--

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.267
he did have some wars against
the Persians--

00:08:51.267 --> 00:08:54.733
his wars of conquest and defense
largely, although not

00:08:54.733 --> 00:08:57.133
exclusively, through
Procopius.

00:08:57.133 --> 00:09:01.567
He is our best source
in two works.

00:09:01.567 --> 00:09:05.533
One, the Secret History, and
the other, much more

00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:09.300
extensive, a series of books
called The Wars.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.467
And they're divided in
Persian wars, African

00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:16.000
wars, Italian wars.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.867
In The Wars, you can see that
once the Italian war starts to

00:09:21.867 --> 00:09:27.000
go badly, Procopius's opinion of
Justinian and of the great

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.500
general Belisarius tend to
change from a kind of

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:42.433
admiration and go, kill, get'em
spirit to uneasiness,

00:09:42.433 --> 00:09:46.500
to blaming, to a kind
of finger pointing.

00:09:51.067 --> 00:09:53.667
So we're dependent
on Procopius.

00:09:53.667 --> 00:09:57.733
And when you first read The
Wars, it seems very, very

00:09:57.733 --> 00:09:59.600
different from the
Secret History.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.600
It seems like it's by Thucydides
or some other

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.533
sensible, objective
Greek writer.

00:10:07.533 --> 00:10:10.533
And he indeed is writing
in that tradition.

00:10:10.533 --> 00:10:13.133
Those of you who've read
Thucydides will remember he

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:17.000
describes, often, folly and
very terrible events, but

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.767
soberly, factually.

00:10:19.767 --> 00:10:26.667
And in a fashion of Olympian
sorrow at the folly of

00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:29.033
policymakers and generals.

00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:31.967
And to some extent, Procopius
has that tone, which seems to

00:10:31.967 --> 00:10:35.833
contrast very much with the
vehemence of the Secret

00:10:35.833 --> 00:10:40.000
History, leading some people
to assume that he was crazy

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.700
when he wrote the
Secret History.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.467
Or off balance, let's say.

00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:52.600
Or that The Wars represented the
real Procopius, and this

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.900
represented his "evil twin." The
term, evil twin, doesn't

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.333
appear in Gibbon,
but it could.

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:02.933
It could.

00:11:02.933 --> 00:11:05.767
What makes it more complicated
is a third work

00:11:05.767 --> 00:11:08.167
of his called Buildings.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:11.667
Buildings is, as the name
implies, a book about

00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:17.767
Justinian's building campaign,
which includes, but is no

00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:21.533
means limited to, the church
of Hagia Sofia in modern

00:11:21.533 --> 00:11:27.000
Istanbul, which is, continues
to be, to this day, an

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.567
extraordinary building
of such immensity and

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:35.133
such space in interior.

00:11:35.133 --> 00:11:39.300
A dome that seems unsupported by
anything and that seems to

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.633
cover half the earth when
you're inside it.

00:11:42.633 --> 00:11:44.267
Both splendid and an

00:11:44.267 --> 00:11:47.567
extraordinary engineering feat.

00:11:47.567 --> 00:11:50.800
And then Justinian
built churches.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.600
He built churches that stand in
Ravenna with unbelievably

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.300
beautiful mosaics,
Ravenna in Italy.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.867
And these are important because
Ravenna was outside

00:12:01.867 --> 00:12:05.500
the zone of territory controlled
by the iconoclasts.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.800
And, therefore while the
iconoclasts tended to take

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.600
down or whitewash
representations of anything

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.933
divine, their reach did not
extend as far as Ravenna.

00:12:16.933 --> 00:12:23.300
So in a way, the best examples
of Byzantine mosaic art of the

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.133
earliest period--

00:12:24.133 --> 00:12:30.533
Not in a way, but absolutely
are outside of the eastern

00:12:30.533 --> 00:12:31.967
Mediterranean, and in Italy.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.433
Buildings though, is not just
an account of Justinian's

00:12:38.433 --> 00:12:42.667
architectural essays, but a

00:12:42.667 --> 00:12:45.667
panegyric, a praise of
Justinian.

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:53.100
Almost as slavishly adulatory
as the Secret History is a

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.833
condemnation.

00:12:55.833 --> 00:12:59.733
And as I suggested last time,
these actually go together in

00:12:59.733 --> 00:13:07.867
a society where a tremendous
power is concentrated in one

00:13:07.867 --> 00:13:14.133
person, or one court, or one
setting, the reactions of

00:13:14.133 --> 00:13:18.633
people tend to be adulation
which is, to some extent,

00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:25.033
forced out of them, or at least
invited by the ruler.

00:13:25.033 --> 00:13:28.833
So again, to take an obvious
analogy: Stalin, for his

00:13:28.833 --> 00:13:32.667
seventieth birthday was pleased
that the greatest

00:13:32.667 --> 00:13:35.833
museum of Moscow, all the
permanent exhibit was set

00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:38.700
aside and warehoused, and the
whole museum was given over to

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.900
gifts to Stalin on his
seventieth birthday from a

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.700
grateful people.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.100
He didn't have to order it.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.800
Somebody came up with the idea
and he said, "Oh, don't go to

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.900
any trouble." They had the
thing, this adulatory.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.667
This is what later would
be called the "cult of

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:57.533
personality." And it's just one
of hundreds of examples.

00:13:57.533 --> 00:14:01.800
Naming cities after him, lauding
him as the "Great

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:08.067
Gardener", "the Friend of
Children," "the successor of

00:14:08.067 --> 00:14:10.433
Lenin", and so forth.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:15.267
The other side of that is a kind
of hatred and diatribe,

00:14:15.267 --> 00:14:17.467
more or less secret.

00:14:17.467 --> 00:14:19.467
There were lots of jokes
about Stalin.

00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:24.800
You could and people were sent
to Siberia or executed for

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.133
telling these jokes.

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:29.267
But they were very good jokes,
under the circumstances.

00:14:32.867 --> 00:14:35.433
This is some of the explanation
for how you can

00:14:35.433 --> 00:14:40.600
get, at the same time, adulation
and demonization.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.667
The interesting thing, of
course, is it's in the same

00:14:42.667 --> 00:14:44.400
guy, Procopius.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.533
And although people at one time
thought, "Oh well, he

00:14:47.533 --> 00:14:51.733
wrote The Buildings earlier
and then became

00:14:51.733 --> 00:14:55.033
disillusioned." He did
become disillusioned.

00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:56.700
Everybody became disillusioned,
because after

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.600
540, things started
to go wrong.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.933
There's a huge plague in 542
that kills off a third of the

00:15:01.933 --> 00:15:04.500
population, for starters.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.167
But it looks as if he's writing
this stuff more or

00:15:07.167 --> 00:15:08.733
less at the same time.

00:15:08.733 --> 00:15:11.533
The Secret History
is not finished.

00:15:11.533 --> 00:15:14.533
That's why it begins so oddly,
not with Justinian, but with

00:15:14.533 --> 00:15:17.467
Belisarius and Belisarius' wife,
being kicked around by

00:15:17.467 --> 00:15:20.433
his wife, and Theodora and you
sort of don't know who these

00:15:20.433 --> 00:15:20.800
people are.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.367
And then suddenly we're
at Justinian.

00:15:23.367 --> 00:15:28.267
Well, the order of this
thing is not yet set.

00:15:28.267 --> 00:15:33.100
He probably did not finish it.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.900
He did, however, want it to be
published after his death.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.767
It's called the Secret History
or the Anecdota, sort of

00:15:41.767 --> 00:15:46.133
stories, by later writers.

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:48.100
It survives in only
one manuscript,

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.400
as I think I remarked.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.533
Nevertheless, because it has a
highly rhetorical style, it

00:15:54.533 --> 00:15:57.567
clearly was to be read
by other people.

00:15:57.567 --> 00:15:59.933
It's not just a set of
jottings for his own

00:15:59.933 --> 00:16:00.767
satisfaction.

00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:05.867
It is a work that he hoped would
be widely published when

00:16:05.867 --> 00:16:07.133
he was safely dead.

00:16:09.967 --> 00:16:14.467
And Anecdota literally means,
not "stories" as it would now,

00:16:14.467 --> 00:16:19.267
anecdotes, the false cognate,
it means "not to be

00:16:19.267 --> 00:16:20.500
published".

00:16:23.433 --> 00:16:28.500
So in the Secret History,
Justinian is a monster.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:34.067
Let's set that aside for a
moment and talk about what

00:16:34.067 --> 00:16:36.200
Justinian actually did.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:44.033
Justinian was the power behind
the throne of his uncle,

00:16:44.033 --> 00:16:47.967
Justin the First. So
in a way, his rule

00:16:47.967 --> 00:16:56.400
goes back to the 510s.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.333
Justinian's character, as
portrayed by Procopius in both

00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:06.700
The Wars and in the Secret
History, is very

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.633
smart, hard - working--

00:17:11.633 --> 00:17:15.633
Procopius says he almost
never slept--

00:17:15.633 --> 00:17:21.833
devoted to details, capable of
immersing himself in many

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:26.167
different things: architecture,
church

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:33.400
ceremonies, theology, and law.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.800
He was of humble birth.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.300
His uncle, and his family
were soldiers.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:49.333
They were from modern oh,
Croatia, more or less, the

00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:52.367
Balkan peninsula, the
former Yugoslavia--

00:17:52.367 --> 00:17:57.433
Illyrians, as would have been
the term used at the time.

00:17:57.433 --> 00:18:03.200
He grew up speaking some form of
Latin, and he is, as I said

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.233
last time, the last emperor
whose native language was

00:18:07.233 --> 00:18:09.467
Latin as opposed to Greek.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:17.667
He dressed very simply, and
he was approachable.

00:18:17.667 --> 00:18:21.900
He did not have that
awe-inspiring splendor of

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.100
Diocletian or Constantine,
for example.

00:18:29.633 --> 00:18:36.533
He was seldom angry, but he was
cold and seems to have had

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:40.233
no trace of mercy or kindness.

00:18:40.233 --> 00:18:42.500
He reminds me of some
professors of mine.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:47.600
He was intolerant; he was

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.733
unforgiving; and he was
merciless.

00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:57.000
He had a grandiose conception
of the Empire.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.900
And he was willing to tax his
subjects heavily and to

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:10.133
endanger the security of the
eastern frontier in order to

00:19:10.133 --> 00:19:13.900
expand his territory
and his prestige.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.933
I think that is a fair
judgment to make.

00:19:17.933 --> 00:19:21.067
He believed that his
predecessors had, through

00:19:21.067 --> 00:19:26.833
neglect, lost what the ancient
Romans had conquered.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.800
And he believed that you
couldn't call it the Roman

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.400
Empire if all it consisted of
were possessions in the

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.667
eastern Mediterranean.

00:19:37.667 --> 00:19:42.267
And, as we've said, he did
indeed conquer, at great cost,

00:19:42.267 --> 00:19:47.500
North Africa, parts of
Spain and Italy.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.200
He had a--

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.500
I think it's wrong to use the
term totalitarian, but

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.833
certainly a very strong

00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:58.967
conception of imperial
rulership.

00:19:58.967 --> 00:20:02.633
He tried to impose doctrines
on the Church in order to

00:20:02.633 --> 00:20:06.200
resolve the age - old
Monophysite question.

00:20:10.033 --> 00:20:12.700
He was no more successful than
Constantine or Theodosius by

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.167
the way, but, for example, just
to give you a sense of

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:19.000
his methods, he kidnapped the
Pope in Rome, tried to

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.433
browbeat him, and exiled
him to the Crimean

00:20:22.433 --> 00:20:25.900
Peninsula where he died.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.067
Theodora.

00:20:28.067 --> 00:20:32.133
One of the most interesting
things about Justinian is that

00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:39.767
he gave so much power and
respect to his consort,

00:20:39.767 --> 00:20:45.433
Theodora, who was of even more
humble birth than he was.

00:20:45.433 --> 00:20:51.500
Now, I don't think we have to
believe Procopius on the

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.267
details of Theodora's youth.

00:20:54.267 --> 00:20:59.300
He certainly reserves
his most hysterical

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.833
diatribes for Theodora.

00:21:01.833 --> 00:21:05.100
I think it's fair to say that
Procopius was not a great

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:10.733
admirer of competent women.

00:21:10.733 --> 00:21:15.367
The historian Bury, J. B.
Bury, one of the great

00:21:15.367 --> 00:21:19.400
historians of late Rome and
Byzantium, who wrote about

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:25.467
100, 120 years ago, describes
her youth as stormy.

00:21:25.467 --> 00:21:29.667
An adjective that I like,
because it could be anything.

00:21:29.667 --> 00:21:30.800
Her stormy youth.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.800
Probably her father
was a bear keeper.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.833
Somebody who kept bears for the
entertainment of people at

00:21:37.833 --> 00:21:38.800
the circus.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.367
An animal trainer.

00:21:41.367 --> 00:21:42.333
She was the mother
of a legitimate

00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:42.767
[correction: illegitimate]

00:21:42.767 --> 00:21:45.033
child.

00:21:45.033 --> 00:21:48.667
She may have had a background
of amateur or

00:21:48.667 --> 00:21:52.700
quasi-professional, semi-pro
prostitution.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.367
Notice that Procopius condemns
her, first for being a

00:21:55.367 --> 00:21:58.267
prostitute, and then for
suppressing prostitution once

00:21:58.267 --> 00:22:00.933
she became Empress.

00:22:00.933 --> 00:22:02.500
There's a logic to that.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.433
Procopius is not opposed
to prostitution.

00:22:05.433 --> 00:22:08.933
One has the sense that he's, if
not a connoisseur, at least

00:22:08.933 --> 00:22:15.400
a now-and-then partaker.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.867
But for prostitutes to be
anything other than this

00:22:19.867 --> 00:22:23.167
firmly subordinated class, that
is, for prostitutes to

00:22:23.167 --> 00:22:29.267
have some sort of voice or
opinion, or for people to

00:22:29.267 --> 00:22:34.767
endeavor to help them, or
respect them, is, in his mind,

00:22:34.767 --> 00:22:36.500
ridiculous and scandalous.

00:22:40.133 --> 00:22:44.900
Procopius is a conservative.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:51.700
He doesn't like the weakening
of the senatorial classes.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.800
He represents the land
- owning interests.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.433
He doesn't like too much
imperial power.

00:22:58.433 --> 00:23:02.867
He's quite happy to respect the
emperor, but is angry when

00:23:02.867 --> 00:23:05.333
the emperor seems to be
taxing rich people.

00:23:09.433 --> 00:23:12.833
He doesn't like upstarts.

00:23:12.833 --> 00:23:14.533
Upstarts like Justinian.

00:23:14.533 --> 00:23:15.700
Who is he?

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.833
A soldier's child.

00:23:17.833 --> 00:23:19.233
Upstarts like Theodora.

00:23:19.233 --> 00:23:24.733
Upstarts like Antonia, the
wife of Belisarius.

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:32.200
Justinian and Theodora
ruled as a team.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.767
They had very different
personalities.

00:23:34.767 --> 00:23:37.700
A very interesting team.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:45.233
Theodora loved sleep, luxury,
was sympathetic to the

00:23:45.233 --> 00:23:46.733
Monophysites.

00:23:46.733 --> 00:23:51.300
Justinian was completely the
opposite: an insomniac,

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.133
somebody who dressed in
extremely ordinary clothing

00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:56.100
and firmly anti-Monophysite.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.500
They, in fact, supported
different

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.100
factions in the circus.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:10.933
Here is a Giants-Jets
marriage.

00:24:10.933 --> 00:24:13.400
The circus.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:18.733
The circus was a arena attached
to the palace, where

00:24:18.733 --> 00:24:20.533
the emperor would make his

00:24:20.533 --> 00:24:23.300
appearances at sporting events.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.067
Although we've said Justinian
was approachable, by that we

00:24:26.067 --> 00:24:31.400
mean that people in the
government or in high

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.733
positions could see him without
too much ceremony.

00:24:35.733 --> 00:24:39.567
That doesn't mean he's
approachable just to anybody.

00:24:39.567 --> 00:24:44.467
In an absolutist state, there
are certain kinds of events at

00:24:44.467 --> 00:24:47.800
which the ruler has to show
himself, or traditionally

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.333
shows himself.

00:24:49.333 --> 00:24:53.500
So in the Soviet era,
the May Day parades.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.100
There's a reviewing stand in
Moscow at the tomb of Lenin.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:01.267
And foreign correspondents and
intelligence people would try

00:25:01.267 --> 00:25:04.967
to see who was in and out of
power by who appeared with the

00:25:04.967 --> 00:25:09.800
leader, who wasn't there, where
they were standing.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.867
The Hippodrome, the horse
racing arena in

00:25:14.867 --> 00:25:16.800
Constantinople, was
a bit like this.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.233
The Emperor had his own box and
the people could make sort

00:25:21.233 --> 00:25:28.033
of celebratory gestures to him,
praise him, and if they

00:25:28.033 --> 00:25:32.033
were in a rebellious mood,
criticize him as well.

00:25:32.033 --> 00:25:35.367
There were of circus factions,
as they're called.

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:40.133
That is, people who were
cheering for one side or

00:25:40.133 --> 00:25:43.200
another, the most important of
which in Constantinople are

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.067
the Blues and the Greens.

00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:52.433
The Greens tended to be somewhat
pro-Monophysite.

00:25:52.433 --> 00:25:56.800
And Theodora was a partisan
of the Greens.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.767
The Blues, anti-Monophysite,
Justinian was

00:25:59.767 --> 00:26:01.300
a partisan of theirs.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:06.633
In 532, the circus factions
revolted.

00:26:06.633 --> 00:26:10.067
Partly, it's a tax revolt.

00:26:10.067 --> 00:26:15.200
Partly it's factions fighting.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.267
It doesn't do to try to probe
what these factions

00:26:18.267 --> 00:26:20.167
represented too much.

00:26:20.167 --> 00:26:22.500
After a while, they're
simply factions.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.367
They're simply people
who like to fight.

00:26:24.367 --> 00:26:27.900
Or who like to root for
one side or another.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.900
But they are rowdy,
and even criminal.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.267
They have very outlandish
costumes.

00:26:37.267 --> 00:26:40.367
They expend all their money
and all their energy on

00:26:40.367 --> 00:26:42.433
sporting events and
on rowdiness

00:26:42.433 --> 00:26:43.967
associated with them.

00:26:43.967 --> 00:26:47.600
This is not completely
unfamiliar.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.800
The prefect of the city arrested
seven people for

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.800
rioting and condemned
them to death.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.733
Two of them escaped when
the rope broke.

00:26:57.733 --> 00:27:00.667
It always pays to
maintain your--

00:27:00.667 --> 00:27:03.567
I mean, this is a tip
from a historian--

00:27:03.567 --> 00:27:07.833
always pays to maintain your
coercive equipment.

00:27:07.833 --> 00:27:11.767
Once these guys escaped,
then they were heroes.

00:27:11.767 --> 00:27:13.700
And they were shielded
from the crowd.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.100
They were put in a monastery
where they had sanctuary.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.000
And conveniently enough,
one was a Blue

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.667
and one was a Green.

00:27:21.667 --> 00:27:24.333
So the Blues and the
Greens united.

00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:26.367
They ran through the
streets demanding

00:27:26.367 --> 00:27:32.233
pardon for the escapees.

00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:35.900
And when Justinian refused,
a riot took place.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:44.433
The battle cry of these rioters
was "Victory." Right?

00:27:44.433 --> 00:27:49.533
Nika, not to be confused with
sporting equipment.

00:27:49.533 --> 00:27:50.733
Nika - victory.

00:27:50.733 --> 00:27:54.500
The crowds tried to overthrow
Justinian and Theodora.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.767
And in the process, they burned
down a lot of the city.

00:28:00.367 --> 00:28:04.133
Justinian is reported
by Procopius as

00:28:04.133 --> 00:28:06.300
being ready to flee.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.667
But Theodora stiffened his
resolve, basically telling him

00:28:09.667 --> 00:28:15.833
she preferred to die in the
shroud of the imperial robes,

00:28:15.833 --> 00:28:24.367
rather than flee in disguise,
and mobilized the generals,

00:28:24.367 --> 00:28:25.767
Belisarius and Narses.

00:28:25.767 --> 00:28:31.000
We've met Belisarius already.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.867
And they cracked down on
the mob and killed

00:28:35.867 --> 00:28:41.500
maybe 40,000 of them.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.333
How many people attend
a Yankee game?

00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:45.100
About 80,000?

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:52.133
So 30,000, 40,000 people, and
that ended the riots.

00:28:52.133 --> 00:28:54.533
Constantinople was
partially burned.

00:28:54.533 --> 00:28:56.633
Justinian loved building.

00:28:56.633 --> 00:28:58.233
This was a great opportunity.

00:28:58.233 --> 00:29:03.533
He couldn't have asked for a
better moment, in a sense.

00:29:03.533 --> 00:29:07.633
Of course, it required more
taxes, but people now had seen

00:29:07.633 --> 00:29:12.167
the problems with
resisting taxes.

00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:15.733
And so this is where we start
the building of the new Hagia

00:29:15.733 --> 00:29:19.433
Sofia that we see today.

00:29:19.433 --> 00:29:20.700
Built in five years.

00:29:24.267 --> 00:29:29.667
Compare this to grand projects
like you know an exit on the

00:29:29.667 --> 00:29:33.667
Connecticut Turnpike, which
take fifteen years or so.

00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:36.267
The way you build something in
five years is by an incredible

00:29:36.267 --> 00:29:38.633
number of workmen.

00:29:38.633 --> 00:29:43.200
And lavish expenditure
of money.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.533
The patriarch's throne in Hagia

00:29:45.533 --> 00:29:46.833
Sofia was made of silver.

00:29:46.833 --> 00:29:50.767
It weighed 40,000 pounds.

00:29:50.767 --> 00:29:56.967
The columns are of porphyry,
many of them.

00:29:56.967 --> 00:29:59.667
It uses a lot of glass in
order to emit light.

00:29:59.667 --> 00:30:03.933
And the light comes from so far
away that it forms these

00:30:03.933 --> 00:30:06.200
wonderful patterns, depending
on the time of day.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.167
Justinian also rebuilt the
Senate, the baths, the

00:30:12.167 --> 00:30:16.400
imperial palace, and in the
Church of Saint Irene, the

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.833
Church of the Apostles,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:30:20.833 --> 00:30:28.533
He started his wars against
Persia before the Nika revolt.

00:30:28.533 --> 00:30:32.100
And the war with Persia
is one episode of a

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.367
multi-century war.

00:30:33.367 --> 00:30:36.167
In this case, it's over
influence in the Caucasus.

00:30:38.767 --> 00:30:42.667
But it's really about trying
to protect Byzantium from

00:30:42.667 --> 00:30:45.600
Persian invasion.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.867
But as I said, Justinian's
interest was

00:30:47.867 --> 00:30:50.900
not really in Persia.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:57.267
He was interested in peace with
Persia and in securing

00:30:57.267 --> 00:31:00.567
enough of the frontier so that
the Persians couldn't launch,

00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:04.267
at least not easily,
a surprise attack.

00:31:04.267 --> 00:31:10.700
And in 531, the Eastern Roman
Empire and Persia signed a

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.967
perpetual peace.

00:31:14.833 --> 00:31:19.533
And Justinian then moved his
troops to the west, the site

00:31:19.533 --> 00:31:22.900
of his real ambitions.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:29.233
The Vandal War in North
Africa was a triumph.

00:31:29.233 --> 00:31:33.233
What we're seeing is one of
those cases in which a policy

00:31:33.233 --> 00:31:36.700
seems to succeed miraculously
easily.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.967
The Vandals fell, it seemed,
without a fight.

00:31:39.967 --> 00:31:50.300
Here, the people who had been
the terror of Rome 100 years

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:54.267
earlier, who had sacked Rome
in 455, who had seized the

00:31:54.267 --> 00:31:58.267
granary of Rome in 430,
fell almost, it

00:31:58.267 --> 00:32:00.367
seemed, without a fight.

00:32:00.367 --> 00:32:05.400
True, the native Berber
population who were

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:10.133
subordinate to the Vandals,
desert people, revolted.

00:32:10.133 --> 00:32:14.133
And they were able to raid the
coast and to undermine the

00:32:14.133 --> 00:32:17.300
position of the Byzantine
occupiers.

00:32:21.233 --> 00:32:25.967
The next stop was
Italy in 535.

00:32:25.967 --> 00:32:30.000
533 - 534, the conquest
of Africa.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.467
But Italy would take twenty
years, not one.

00:32:33.467 --> 00:32:37.900
And in the process, Italy itself
would be devastated.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.867
And with that devastation, a lot
of classical culture would

00:32:40.867 --> 00:32:43.833
be lost. What wasn't destroyed
by the fifth century

00:32:43.833 --> 00:32:44.533
invasions--

00:32:44.533 --> 00:32:48.033
and remember we said the
Ostrogoths were pretty

00:32:48.033 --> 00:32:50.867
reasonable occupiers--

00:32:50.867 --> 00:32:54.700
would be destroyed by the
Romans themselves.

00:32:57.567 --> 00:33:02.400
I will not tax you with the
ins and outs, and ups and

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.600
downs of this campaign.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.133
Suffice it to say that the
general, Belisarius, at first

00:33:07.133 --> 00:33:09.300
was able to triumph in Italy.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.967
The Ostrogothic resistance,
however, proved to be much

00:33:11.967 --> 00:33:13.867
stronger than he expected.

00:33:13.867 --> 00:33:22.400
And Justinian recalled
Belisarius.

00:33:25.267 --> 00:33:28.333
Almost all of Italy was
reoccupied by the Ostrogoths

00:33:28.333 --> 00:33:33.333
and it was only the second
general, Narses, who from 552

00:33:33.333 --> 00:33:36.600
to 555 is able to
take over Italy.

00:33:41.333 --> 00:33:47.333
540 is the year that Ravenna
falls to the Byzantines, and

00:33:47.333 --> 00:33:50.833
it seems to be the zenith
of Justinian's reign.

00:33:53.533 --> 00:33:57.467
In that year, the Persians
invaded.

00:33:57.467 --> 00:34:01.633
That perpetual peace had
lasted nine years.

00:34:01.633 --> 00:34:06.267
And the Persian invasion
was quite successful.

00:34:10.967 --> 00:34:15.267
It resulted in the sack of the
largest city of the Empire

00:34:15.267 --> 00:34:19.200
after Constantinople and
Alexandria, the city of

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.600
Antioch in the Eastern
Mediterranean.

00:34:26.367 --> 00:34:32.200
And this was followed
then by a plague.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.167
The so-called Justinianic
Plague, which seems to be

00:34:35.167 --> 00:34:40.400
related perhaps to the plague
of Peracles' Athens or the

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.767
Athens of the Peloponnesian War,
and maybe to the Black

00:34:44.767 --> 00:34:49.500
Death of 1348, 1349.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.367
Hard to say.

00:34:50.367 --> 00:34:55.967
And in fact, research now being
done on the DNA in mass

00:34:55.967 --> 00:35:00.300
graves from that plague will
perhaps tell us what the

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.200
disease really was.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.933
Although so far, apparently,
it hasn't.

00:35:07.933 --> 00:35:13.667
So from 540 to 565, the death of
Justinian, his policies are

00:35:13.667 --> 00:35:15.867
officially successful.

00:35:15.867 --> 00:35:19.000
555, the fall of Italy.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.367
The plague eventually
goes away.

00:35:21.367 --> 00:35:25.867
The Persians are pushed out of
Antioch, at least. But the

00:35:25.867 --> 00:35:30.033
Empire in the later years
of Justinian is clearly

00:35:30.033 --> 00:35:37.000
staggering under the weight of
taxation, economic downturn,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.400
declining population,
and over-extension.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.867
They had conquered Italy, but
the Italy they had conquered

00:35:44.867 --> 00:35:46.100
was ruined.

00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:53.767
And this empire, stretching now
from Sicily to the Persian

00:35:53.767 --> 00:35:58.633
frontier is clearly too
big to hold onto.

00:35:58.633 --> 00:36:04.667
So this is some of what
Procopius' anger is about.

00:36:04.667 --> 00:36:15.033
But he's bitter and
disillusioned.

00:36:15.033 --> 00:36:17.000
He says, "But I grow
dizzy when I

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.633
write of such suffering.

00:36:18.633 --> 00:36:21.467
And pass on to future times
it's memories." Here, he's

00:36:21.467 --> 00:36:24.767
speaking about the Persian
invasion of Antioch.

00:36:24.767 --> 00:36:28.367
"For I cannot understand why it
is the will of God to exalt

00:36:28.367 --> 00:36:32.200
the fortunes of a man, or place
him and cast them down

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.800
for no reason that
we can see."

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.800
Now if you contrast him with
what you've read in Augustine,

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.567
in The Confessions, you can see
that Augustine has some

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:45.433
reasons why this happens.

00:36:45.433 --> 00:36:48.500
Procopius resists the Christian
explanation here.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:52.300
And this is led some observers
to think, in general, that

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:56.167
he's not really somehow
a Christian.

00:36:56.167 --> 00:36:59.700
He is, but he's writing in
a classical tradition.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.267
And he is also, remember, an
"elitist" a conservative.

00:37:04.267 --> 00:37:07.733
I use the term elitist in
a fairly neutral sense.

00:37:07.733 --> 00:37:11.467
It's hard to expect someone
whose writings come down to us

00:37:11.467 --> 00:37:15.567
all this length of time to be,
somehow, an ordinary person.

00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:18.733
Yes, he represents a class.

00:37:18.733 --> 00:37:21.367
But doesn't really like
religious controversy.

00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:28.100
But doesn't really like all of
the fussing about the natures

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.600
or nature of Christ.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.167
But there are other things that
are not in Procopius that

00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:34.533
are somewhat surprising.

00:37:34.533 --> 00:37:40.767
Justinian is best known for
architectural monuments like

00:37:40.767 --> 00:37:44.633
Hagia Sofia; to historians, for
what we are essentially

00:37:44.633 --> 00:37:50.400
talking about today, the Western
conquest; and for his

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.967
legal reforms, the Justinianic
Law Code, which is the basis

00:37:54.967 --> 00:37:57.667
of all European law.

00:37:57.667 --> 00:38:01.533
European, that is, as opposed
to Anglo-American.

00:38:01.533 --> 00:38:04.467
Anglo-American law is a
separate tradition.

00:38:04.467 --> 00:38:08.733
European law is based ultimately
on a reworking of

00:38:08.733 --> 00:38:11.533
Roman law precedents.

00:38:11.533 --> 00:38:13.833
And so I want to talk a little
bit about his legal

00:38:13.833 --> 00:38:18.500
accomplishment, which Procopius,
a man who would be

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:23.667
familiar with law courts, with
legal systems, doesn't tell us

00:38:23.667 --> 00:38:25.500
anything about in his works.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.767
Virtually nothing.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:34.467
Justinian essentially codified
the Roman law.

00:38:34.467 --> 00:38:37.567
And this is important, not only
because it's the basis of

00:38:37.567 --> 00:38:40.867
European law, but law is related
to political and

00:38:40.867 --> 00:38:42.033
administrative order.

00:38:42.033 --> 00:38:45.300
However much we may hate
bureaucracy, or denounce

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:52.067
administration, that is how
governments provide whatever

00:38:52.067 --> 00:38:55.100
it is they are providing
for their citizens.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:39:00.100
And since the alternative to
government is anarchy, and

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.033
since there are examples before
our eyes of anarchic

00:39:03.033 --> 00:39:08.633
societies, it won't do to
underestimate the benefits of

00:39:08.633 --> 00:39:14.067
law, however cynical we may be
about its implementation.

00:39:14.067 --> 00:39:18.300
Roman law at the time of
Justinian was, as law tends to

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.400
be, learned and unwieldy.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.500
If you wanted to know how to
resolve a question, you could

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:33.267
go through the thousands and
thousands of what are called

00:39:33.267 --> 00:39:37.200
"responsae", or you could
look at legislation.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.300
Just as in the Anglo-American
tradition, and some of you

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.900
will learn this very soon in
law school, you can either

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:48.633
look at statutes passed by
legislatures or court cases--

00:39:48.633 --> 00:39:50.333
precedents.

00:39:50.333 --> 00:39:53.800
The equivalent of a statute,
Connecticut passes a law

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.767
saying that you can't have
a gun in your car.

00:39:56.767 --> 00:40:01.167
Whereas Texas has laws that say
you could have a gun in

00:40:01.167 --> 00:40:03.967
your car under such and such
circumstances, OK?

00:40:03.967 --> 00:40:10.367
So you have a whole set of
statute law, which would be

00:40:10.367 --> 00:40:14.267
imperial statutes in the Roman
Empire, imperial legislation.

00:40:17.233 --> 00:40:25.333
Or, if the statutes don't cover
a particular situation,

00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:27.967
or you want something that
has the particularity--

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.267
a tree on my property falls
on my neighbor's--

00:40:39.267 --> 00:40:41.033
did I mention this already?

00:40:41.033 --> 00:40:42.367
Yeah, that one--

00:40:42.367 --> 00:40:43.600
on my neighbor's garage.

00:40:46.233 --> 00:40:47.933
Who's to blame?

00:40:47.933 --> 00:40:52.700
OK, you go and you say, well,
this case came up in

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:59.300
Cincinnati in 1949, and this
is what the judge found.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.100
In the absence of computers,
the search for this

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.233
stuff is very hard.

00:41:05.233 --> 00:41:11.467
In Anglo-American law this is
called "precedent." In Roman

00:41:11.467 --> 00:41:14.867
law, they're called "responsae."
And interestingly

00:41:14.867 --> 00:41:17.933
enough, this term is also
singular, plural.

00:41:17.933 --> 00:41:20.433
It applies to Jewish law.

00:41:20.433 --> 00:41:23.500
A response is a response.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:28.000
A judge, an expert, a law
professor, in effect, is asked

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.900
his opinion on something.

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.900
And his response becomes
preserved

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.167
as a kind of precedent.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:41.033
These were voluminous and
represented centuries of law.

00:41:41.033 --> 00:41:44.733
And even more, of course, the
responsae conflicted.

00:41:44.733 --> 00:41:49.033
One judge says, "You have to pay
because it was your tree."

00:41:49.033 --> 00:41:54.500
Another says, "It's an accident,
he's responsible for

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.400
his own remedies."

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.233
What do you do if you have
a conflict of judges?

00:41:59.233 --> 00:42:01.767
What would you do if you
have two kinds of

00:42:01.767 --> 00:42:04.167
contradictory responses?

00:42:04.167 --> 00:42:07.367
You've got to decide who
is more authoritative?

00:42:07.367 --> 00:42:09.833
Which one is better?

00:42:09.833 --> 00:42:14.367
So the work of Justinian's
compilers was to sort out

00:42:14.367 --> 00:42:20.000
legislation, statutes, and the
responses, and also to decide

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.700
among contradictory ones.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.433
What is in this law?

00:42:25.433 --> 00:42:26.867
Well, what's in any law?

00:42:26.867 --> 00:42:30.800
We think of law as having mostly
to do with criminals

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.800
and stuff like that.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.167
But criminal law is actually
very simple.

00:42:34.167 --> 00:42:37.600
It's like the Burgundian code.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.967
If you murder someone, this is
what's going to happen to you.

00:42:40.967 --> 00:42:42.600
There may be different
kinds of killing.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.533
If you murder them with intent
and premeditation, that's

00:42:45.533 --> 00:42:47.800
worse than if you murder them in
a fight and spontaneously.

00:42:52.133 --> 00:42:54.733
Manslaughter is different
from murder.

00:42:54.733 --> 00:42:56.700
Manslaughter is where you didn't
intend to kill the

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.167
person, but you did.

00:42:59.167 --> 00:43:01.900
You punched him, and you didn't
know they had a weak

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.167
heart and he died.

00:43:03.167 --> 00:43:05.633
That's manslaughter.

00:43:05.633 --> 00:43:06.467
You punched them.

00:43:06.467 --> 00:43:08.267
You intended to hurt him, but
you didn't intend to kill him,

00:43:08.267 --> 00:43:10.900
but he died.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.167
Vehicular manslaughter.

00:43:14.367 --> 00:43:16.600
What's the difference
between negligence--

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.767
you should have seen something
and you didn't-- versus

00:43:18.767 --> 00:43:20.233
criminal intent?

00:43:20.233 --> 00:43:21.467
You did it deliberately.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.467
But it's very simple,
the criminal law.

00:43:28.467 --> 00:43:32.267
There aren't a whole lot of gray
areas, and you can get

00:43:32.267 --> 00:43:34.367
through the criminal code
pretty quickly.

00:43:34.367 --> 00:43:37.633
But what about contracts?

00:43:37.633 --> 00:43:39.900
What about property?

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.600
This is endless.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.633
This is endless.

00:43:42.633 --> 00:43:49.033
So you know in law school,
criminal law will be the

00:43:49.033 --> 00:43:56.167
cream, or the tip of the
proverbial iceberg, or some

00:43:56.167 --> 00:43:57.867
little side issue.

00:43:57.867 --> 00:44:00.733
Most of your time is going
to be spent on--

00:44:00.733 --> 00:44:02.967
those of you who go
for this option--

00:44:02.967 --> 00:44:05.700
on property and contracts.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.300
And that's what the Justinian
law is mostly: property and

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:12.900
contracts, legal arrangements
for buying and selling,

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:18.633
inheriting, partnerships,
guardianships, security,

00:44:18.633 --> 00:44:22.133
surety, obligations.

00:44:22.133 --> 00:44:26.100
This is a very advanced
science in Roman law.

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:30.200
As advanced as it is anywhere,
at any time.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.867
This is very different from "You
cut off one finger; you

00:44:34.867 --> 00:44:39.367
pay five solidi", which we were
looking at last week.

00:44:39.367 --> 00:44:43.400
The work that ensued, the
so-called Justinianic code, or

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:54.667
the Corpus Iuris Civilis, the
body of civil law, was drawn

00:44:54.667 --> 00:44:55.933
up in five years.

00:44:55.933 --> 00:45:00.167
Here, again, is an example
of unbelievable rapidity,

00:45:00.167 --> 00:45:06.200
compared with the length of time
it takes now, merely to

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:11.000
reform the Connecticut
tax code--

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.433
for that matter.

00:45:13.433 --> 00:45:17.467
It was undertaken
by a commission.

00:45:17.467 --> 00:45:20.867
Four books were issued.

00:45:20.867 --> 00:45:23.467
The first is a collection
of statutes, and

00:45:23.467 --> 00:45:24.700
it's called the Codex.

00:45:27.033 --> 00:45:31.100
Collected laws of the
Senate and imperial

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:35.333
laws of previous centuries.

00:45:35.333 --> 00:45:41.200
The largest book is the Digest,
or in Latin, Digesta.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:48.933
The Digest is the weeded-out
responsae,

00:45:48.933 --> 00:45:52.233
organized by subject.

00:45:52.233 --> 00:45:57.333
So this would be where you would
go to try and figure out

00:45:57.333 --> 00:46:01.633
what happens if a river changes
its course a little,

00:46:01.633 --> 00:46:07.767
and your land seems to be now
taken over by your neighbor.

00:46:07.767 --> 00:46:12.600
Is the river the border, or is
an artificial line the border?

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.767
The third book is a kind of
textbook, or a survey of the

00:46:21.767 --> 00:46:24.967
whole law and what it's supposed
to mean called the

00:46:24.967 --> 00:46:26.200
Institutes.

00:46:28.933 --> 00:46:32.600
And the fourth is called the
Novella, or new laws, because

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.600
obviously, new laws would
have to be made.

00:46:37.367 --> 00:46:40.800
The Codex, the Digest, the
Institutes are in Latin,

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.400
because Latin was the language
of the Roman Empire.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:47.200
But the Novella are in Greek,
because Greek was the language

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.600
of the Empire now.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:53.833
"Now" being 534 when this
work was finished.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.833
The Justinianic Code is more,
however, than a rearrangement

00:47:00.833 --> 00:47:02.100
of old laws.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:08.967
It displayed a consistent
philosophy of government where

00:47:08.967 --> 00:47:14.500
law is more than precedent, is
an active force in society.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.833
The Emperor is seen as the
servant of the law, the

00:47:17.833 --> 00:47:19.467
implementer of the law,
but he's also the

00:47:19.467 --> 00:47:21.200
master of the law.

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.633
He is an absolute power.

00:47:22.633 --> 00:47:24.733
He is the embodiment
of the law.

00:47:29.133 --> 00:47:36.833
This is a well-run, immense,
burdensome empire.

00:47:36.833 --> 00:47:41.233
Procopius gives us, unreliable
though he may be as to

00:47:41.233 --> 00:47:45.167
Justinian being a demon, et
cetera, Procopius gives us a

00:47:45.167 --> 00:47:50.467
vivid picture of a
highly-governed, even

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:54.133
efficiently-governed, but
oppressively-governed and very

00:47:54.133 --> 00:47:55.400
ambitious society.

00:47:58.733 --> 00:48:02.100
Now for next week, and a little
bit after, remember we

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.333
have no class on Wednesday.

00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:05.900
We have class on Monday.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:11.000
We are going to read from
Gregory of Tours about Clovis

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.500
and the Franks.

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:17.000
And it will seem more violent
and more primitive than what

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.933
we've been reading.

00:48:18.933 --> 00:48:20.833
But violence and primitiveness,
unfortunately,

00:48:20.833 --> 00:48:24.400
are part of history and
government at almost any time.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.133
And so, enjoy the intrigue.

00:48:27.133 --> 00:48:28.933
I'm not going to test
you on the names.

00:48:28.933 --> 00:48:32.700
You'll see there are lots of
great cat names of the

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.400
Frankish barbarians.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.033
But pay attention to the figure
of Clovis, and to the

00:48:38.033 --> 00:48:39.867
attitude of Gregory.

00:48:39.867 --> 00:48:43.867
Because, as with Procopius,
we've got an interesting, if

00:48:43.867 --> 00:48:45.267
not completely reliable source.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.170
Prof: Today we have our
first guest lecturer.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.290
I have the pleasure of
introducing you to Dr. Michael

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.190
Teitelbaum.
 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.484
He was an undergraduate at Reed
College where he double majored

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:21.225
in biology and sociology;
that's an interesting

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:25.530
combination, he's Phi Beta Kappa
and at the end of that became a

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.760
Rhodes scholar.
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.259
How many prospective Rhodes
scholars do we have in the

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.090
class?
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.544
Then he went to Oxford as a
biologist to study reproductive

00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:41.460
biology and his advisor died.
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.528
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 Well first he was

00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:47.340
paralyzed for--he died a
horrible slow death,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.980
yes.
 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.230
Prof: Something bad
happened.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.134
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 Something terrible

00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:52.640
happened.
 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.558
Prof: Then got into the
statistical and quantitative

00:00:56.558 --> 00:00:59.936
aspects of that and then
eventually he got a PhD in

00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:03.520
demography itself,
and since then he's come back

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.250
to America and he's taught at
Oxford,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.730
and Princeton, and here at Yale.
 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.426
Unlike most academics,
he actually ventured into the

00:01:13.426 --> 00:01:16.439
real world, although I'm not
sure some of these are really

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.188
like the real world,
like the U.S. Government.

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:21.430
Dr. Michael Titlebaum:
 Yeah, somewhat unreal.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.117
Prof: He was the staff
director of a Select Committee

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:28.244
on Population for the
U.S. House of Representatives

00:01:28.244 --> 00:01:31.995
and then was U.S. Commissioner
for the Study of International

00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:34.870
Migration and Cooperative
Economic Development,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.310
so that's pretty important.
 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.239
He's been with the Ford
Foundation,

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:42.260
The Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.479
and he's now with The Alfred
Sloan Foundation where he's been

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.220
vice president and in charge of
science and technology programs.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.748
He's been on the advisory
boards at National Academy

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.922
Sciences, National Institutes of
Health, American Association for

00:01:58.922 --> 00:02:00.459
the Advancement of Science.
 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:06.805
He's authored seven books,
but I could only find four:

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:09.680
one, two, three,
four.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.990
So in addition to your reading
packet, which I hope you all

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.658
picked up--this is just your
reading for tonight.

00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:26.443
In addition to--this is half
his books--five major government

00:02:26.443 --> 00:02:29.610
reports, 75 articles,
etc.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.150
One of his major contributions
is what we've--

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.440
one of the topics we've just
been--just finished discussing,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.821
he wrote--I think I mentioned
this to you during the lecture

00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.628
that part of the Princeton
project on Britain,

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:44.559
the book on the British
fertility decline,

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.060
there's the author.
 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.690
And The Times Higher
Education Supplement,

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.126
wrote on that book:
"An unsurpassed profusion

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:59.264
of original data presented and
analyzed with clarity all too

00:02:59.264 --> 00:03:02.069
often lacking in works of this
kind.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.521
The book is invaluable;
it clarifies and orders the

00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:08.566
complex rang of forces,
which underlay the modern

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:11.038
decline in rates of
fertility."

00:03:11.038 --> 00:03:15.718
He's also worked on global
environmental issues and

00:03:15.718 --> 00:03:19.437
population and resources,
he wrote this,

00:03:19.437 --> 00:03:22.717
an environmental book,
is one of the best

00:03:22.717 --> 00:03:23.960
investigations.
 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.391
So, you have the honor,
not only the lecture today,

00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:31.306
but he's agreed to come to
dinner and all the students are

00:03:31.306 --> 00:03:32.128
invited.
 

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:35.549
It's going to be at Timothy
Dwight starting at 5:30 and I

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.318
know you have other things.
 

00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:39.210
If you can't--we'll probably
have a leisurely--

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.736
casual leisurely dinner,
so if you can't get there at

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:44.408
5:30,
come when you can--or if you

00:03:44.408 --> 00:03:47.508
have something else afterwards,
come and go.

00:03:47.508 --> 00:03:48.089
At TD.
 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:53.881
There's some sort of a small
dining room as you leave--as you

00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:55.330
come around.
 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.211
Okay in the last lecture we
discussed the fertility declines

00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:02.633
in Europe and Tuesday we
discussed how this fertility

00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:05.319
decline--
started discussing--has

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.218
continued in Europe and spread
around the world.

00:04:09.218 --> 00:04:13.460
I showed you a graph of the
decline in fertility rates

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.340
globally.
 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.910
In the developed countries--so
in the world as a whole,

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.163
as you've been told,
the fertility decline has not

00:04:22.163 --> 00:04:25.684
been enough to keep the
population from still going up

00:04:25.684 --> 00:04:28.134
very rapidly,
we discussed that,

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:29.740
but in Europe,
Japan,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.810
the advanced countries,
the fertility decline has

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.690
caused the population to come
down enough,

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.983
and these countries are now
facing rather serious problems

00:04:40.983 --> 00:04:43.391
of a decline,
a possible decline,

00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:46.514
in their population,
certainly a change in behavior

00:04:46.514 --> 00:04:50.348
structure and this is what
Michael is an expert on and so

00:04:50.348 --> 00:04:54.389
that is what he will discuss
today as soon as I shut up.

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.783
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 Well thank you very much

00:04:56.783 --> 00:04:58.829
Dr. Wyman and it's a pleasure
to be here.

00:04:58.829 --> 00:05:02.411
I just want to say,
you're a very lucky bunch of

00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:06.680
undergraduates to have Robert
Wyman as your professor.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.266
He's a--I've heard him lecture
and I know him and he's a

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:17.220
wonderful academic and scholar.
 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.437
Going through that list of--
Prof: We give each other

00:05:20.437 --> 00:05:20.819
$100 tip.
 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.334
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 Going through that list of

00:05:24.334 --> 00:05:28.035
publications makes me realize
why my wife has been so annoyed

00:05:28.035 --> 00:05:31.920
with me for the 40 years nearly
that we've been married,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.899
because a lot of that work has
had to be done when I wasn't an

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:42.045
academic and that means it comes
out of your hide or out of your

00:05:42.045 --> 00:05:45.016
summer holidays,
or weekends,

00:05:45.016 --> 00:05:48.790
or evenings,
but it's interesting,

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.389
exciting, and wonderful to do,
and I've enjoyed doing it.

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.935
I know that you have been
discussing--because I've seen

00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:01.639
your prospectus for this
excellent course.

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.197
I know you've been discussing
high fertility rates and the

00:06:06.197 --> 00:06:10.514
demographic transition and you
know therefore that high

00:06:10.514 --> 00:06:15.391
fertility has attracted a great
deal of attention for at least

00:06:15.391 --> 00:06:20.750
two centuries and has always
been related to poverty issues,

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.699
concerns about poverty,
underdevelopment,

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.067
developing countries and so on,
or poverty back in the 1800s

00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:32.016
when Malthus was writing,
and also related to concerns

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:34.230
about the environment and so on.
 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.978
What is less known though is
that, for at least 100 years of

00:06:38.978 --> 00:06:42.920
those two centuries,
there's been discussion about

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.060
low fertility as a problem as
well.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.781
This has a long and,
I would say,

00:06:49.781 --> 00:06:55.129
tumultuous history,
lots of proponents worrying

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:02.689
about it, often very prominent
people in politics or science.

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:06.971
I would say the debates have
been plagued by misunderstanding

00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:11.110
and confusion as have the
debates about high fertility,

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.632
so there's something about
population that stimulates

00:07:14.632 --> 00:07:16.870
misunderstanding and confusion.
 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.401
Now in general,
low fertility has been linked

00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:25.420
to a decline in power.
 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.069
You have to think about this in
political and economic terms.

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:33.019
National power,
empires, the decline of empires

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:36.803
and so on, but the links have
been made, but it's often very

00:07:36.803 --> 00:07:39.370
fuzzy as to what the causal flow
is.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.461
Is the low fertility a cause of
the decline of empires or

00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:46.970
decline of national power,
or is it a symptom?

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.132
Often the commentators don't
make it very clear what they're

00:07:49.132 --> 00:07:49.720
talking about.
 

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.502
Those of you who know the
French debates about these

00:07:53.502 --> 00:07:57.954
issues will know that it's a
very prominent feature of French

00:07:57.954 --> 00:08:01.514
intellectual discourse going
back into the 1870s,

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:02.850
for example.
 

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.750
The French are hardly alone in
this.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.548
You will find many such
anxieties expressed in Germany

00:08:09.548 --> 00:08:11.699
in the 1930s,
in Great Britain,

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:13.850
Sweden, U.S.,
Russia, etc.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.425
More recently,
let's say over the past four

00:08:17.425 --> 00:08:20.151
decades or so,
in Eastern Europe,

00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:22.278
in Japan, in the U.S.
 

00:08:22.278 --> 00:08:27.663
certainly, and in the Asian
Tigers most recently:

00:08:27.663 --> 00:08:31.139
Singapore, Taiwan,
and Korea.

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:34.573
Because it's about power,
national power,

00:08:34.573 --> 00:08:39.383
or sub-national power low
fertility has long been closely

00:08:39.383 --> 00:08:44.019
tied to political ideology and
to cultural values.

00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:47.643
In some cases,
low fertility has even been

00:08:47.643 --> 00:08:52.240
used as a tool to achieve
desired social policies.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.985
I want to make one point,
that I hope you'll take away

00:08:54.985 --> 00:08:57.698
from this,
which is that the concern about

00:08:57.698 --> 00:09:02.034
low fertility has never,
ever, been solely about the

00:09:02.034 --> 00:09:06.966
number of warm bodies,
human being warm bodies that

00:09:06.966 --> 00:09:12.065
is, but instead it's been
visualized through the lens of

00:09:12.065 --> 00:09:14.940
these socio cultural values.
 

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:20.772
The reason I say it's never
been about warm bodies can be

00:09:20.772 --> 00:09:24.900
illustrated there,
because if what I said is not

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.649
true there really could never
have been any concern about

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:30.860
fertility since at least 1950.
 

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.500
The world's population,
as you see,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.158
has grown dramatically over
that half century and neither

00:09:37.158 --> 00:09:42.231
could there be any concern about
future population demographic

00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:47.389
trends because the projections
no matter which variant you take

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:52.379
from the UN all show substantial
growth going forward.

00:09:52.379 --> 00:09:57.292
In reality, the fears about low
fertility are also framed in

00:09:57.292 --> 00:10:01.174
terms of regional or national,
or religious,

00:10:01.174 --> 00:10:06.240
or ethnic or sub-national
populations defined culturally.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.080
I would put it rather crudely,
if I may,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:16.080
that since the onset of
mortality decline which you've

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.570
heard about already,
at least two centuries ago,

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.610
there have never been any
shortages of humans.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.927
There have only been perceived
or relative shortages of

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:29.710
particular kinds of humans.
 

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.480
The most critical category is
national groups in these

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.753
discussions and then you can get
into language,

00:10:36.753 --> 00:10:39.600
or religion,
or the other subgroups.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.657
To give you an example of this
I just want to point out that

00:10:43.657 --> 00:10:47.461
when he was Mayor of Paris,
the later President of the

00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:50.572
Republic of France,
Jacque Chirac,

00:10:50.572 --> 00:10:57.509
he warned about the decline in
the population of France.

00:10:57.509 --> 00:11:04.298
This is consistent with French
perspectives that right to left,

00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:10.148
all French people think that
there are two few French people

00:11:10.148 --> 00:11:15.798
and yet at the same time he
urged the repatriation of Arab

00:11:15.798 --> 00:11:21.450
immigrants and the restriction
of future immigration.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.850
I mean now that classically
shows you that it's not about

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.528
the number of warm bodies;
it's about the number of French

00:11:27.528 --> 00:11:29.370
warm bodies in France.
 

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.058
There is no ideological
uniformity in these things.

00:11:34.058 --> 00:11:37.938
I've already said that in
France the range of concerns is

00:11:37.938 --> 00:11:41.749
right from the left to the
right, right across political

00:11:41.749 --> 00:11:42.649
spectrum.
 

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:46.730
Democratic thinkers of what you
might call liberal in the U.S.,

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.543
or left wing in Europe say,
and of conservative

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:53.203
orientations,
have all expressed concern

00:11:53.203 --> 00:11:55.000
about this in one form or
another.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.114
Those are democratic thinkers,
non-democrats such as the

00:12:00.114 --> 00:12:04.950
nationalist right in inter-war
Germany and Italy,

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.551
and nationalists parties such
as the Front Nacionalé

00:12:08.551 --> 00:12:12.090
in France and other European
countries have expressed such

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.025
concerns,
as have the authoritarian lefts

00:12:16.025 --> 00:12:20.379
of Stalin and Nicolea Ceausescu
in Romania.

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:22.821
There's a whole story about
Romania which I've written

00:12:22.821 --> 00:12:23.190
about.
 

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:28.177
If you want to see a bizarre
situation read about what the

00:12:28.177 --> 00:12:31.590
Romanian government did in the
1960s.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.750
On the political right,
low fertility has generally

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.470
been seen as a threat to
national power,

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.472
imperial power,
or from the point of some with

00:12:40.472 --> 00:12:45.937
a more economics orientation,
to the capacity to restrain

00:12:45.937 --> 00:12:49.759
wages and the power of unions.
 

00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:53.202
Many on the right have also
expressed alarm about fertility

00:12:53.202 --> 00:12:56.168
differentials between social
classes and races,

00:12:56.168 --> 00:13:01.322
ethnic groups and so forth,
but frankly such concerns are

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:06.750
subliminal but there in other
political persuasions than the

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.668
right.
 

00:13:07.668 --> 00:13:10.866
Meanwhile, as I said,
the political left has often

00:13:10.866 --> 00:13:14.259
shared these nationalistic and
strategic concerns.

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:17.301
In the 1930s,
Hitler's Germany adopted very

00:13:17.301 --> 00:13:21.647
aggressive pronatalist policies
to raise fertility in Germany

00:13:21.647 --> 00:13:25.413
but so did Stalin's USSR,
same time, same place or

00:13:25.413 --> 00:13:29.090
different places same time,
same policies in many ways.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.240
Then there were the socialist
states,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.207
I mentioned Ceausescu,
had a very strong pronatalist

00:13:34.207 --> 00:13:36.383
policy,
but in the meantime the

00:13:36.383 --> 00:13:40.471
People's Republic of China went
from pronatalism to strongly

00:13:40.471 --> 00:13:43.860
anti-natalist,
probably the most energetic

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.509
fertility reduction policy in
world history,

00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:51.129
same country,
same party in control --

00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:55.779
taking population very
significantly.

00:13:55.779 --> 00:13:58.668
Now, in the West,
the democratic left has

00:13:58.668 --> 00:14:03.072
concentrated generally on the
threat posed by low fertility to

00:14:03.072 --> 00:14:07.548
their desires to expand and
strengthen the welfare state,

00:14:07.548 --> 00:14:10.426
and in fact,
if you look at in 1930s you'll

00:14:10.426 --> 00:14:14.124
see a fascinating debate led by
the Myrdal's (prominent

00:14:14.124 --> 00:14:17.365
economists,
Nobel laureates later of the

00:14:17.365 --> 00:14:21.503
left in Sweden) who promoted
what came to be called the

00:14:21.503 --> 00:14:25.333
welfare state to the
conservative parties in Sweden

00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:29.548
on the grounds that they needed
to do something to raise

00:14:29.548 --> 00:14:33.149
fertility and that was the way
to do it.

00:14:33.149 --> 00:14:36.772
If they didn't raise fertility,
there would be no Swedes left

00:14:36.772 --> 00:14:39.658
in 50 years or so,
and they actually co-opted the

00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:42.412
right successfully into
supporting the welfare state

00:14:42.412 --> 00:14:43.600
that they promoted.
 

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.620
What about demographers?
 

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.850
Have they been involved in this
stuff?

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:51.470
Yes, they have including some
very prominent ones.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.634
One reason for this was the
discovery, the development in

00:14:55.634 --> 00:15:00.024
the 1930s by demographers of
some very powerful concepts and

00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:01.139
techniques.
 

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:04.302
I don't know if you've actually
studied yet the intrinsic rate

00:15:04.302 --> 00:15:06.018
of increase,
net reproduction rate,

00:15:06.018 --> 00:15:08.918
total fertility rate,
and demographic projection

00:15:08.918 --> 00:15:09.509
models.
 

00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:13.186
All of these being
developed--technologies

00:15:13.186 --> 00:15:18.119
developed in the 1930s and these
led to predictions from

00:15:18.119 --> 00:15:23.500
demographers that the population
of the United Kingdom,

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:28.259
for example from the 1930s to
the 1960s,

00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:33.437
would decline very sharply and
there were some very pathetic

00:15:33.437 --> 00:15:37.738
novels and academic books
written with titles like

00:15:37.738 --> 00:15:43.105
Twilight of Parenthood,
Race Suicide,

00:15:43.105 --> 00:15:45.629
and other such tomes.
 

00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:48.506
That forecast,
using demographic projection

00:15:48.506 --> 00:15:51.658
models, that there would be too
few whatever's,

00:15:51.658 --> 00:15:53.440
of the relevant group.
 

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.827
Now in some respects these were
flawed predictions,

00:15:55.827 --> 00:15:56.399
obviously.
 

00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:58.644
It didn't happen,
and they arose from

00:15:58.644 --> 00:16:02.386
misunderstanding because these
were new technologies that had

00:16:02.386 --> 00:16:06.004
only recently been understood
and developed and there was a

00:16:06.004 --> 00:16:09.456
typical excess of enthusiasm,
academic enthusiasm,

00:16:09.456 --> 00:16:12.774
they really thought they had
developed a window into the

00:16:12.774 --> 00:16:13.860
distant future.
 

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.971
They could project the
population using intrinsic rates

00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:20.081
of increase and projection
models and they could see 50

00:16:20.081 --> 00:16:21.580
years into the future.
 

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.129
They thought.
 

00:16:24.129 --> 00:16:25.970
They were wrong.
 

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.558
All of those projections proved
to be empirically wrong.

00:16:30.558 --> 00:16:34.320
We know better now because
we've seen they were wrong.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.870
It helps to actually see things
go so badly wrong,

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.985
but these same errors of
believing demographic

00:16:41.985 --> 00:16:47.292
projections to be forecasts of
future populations are being

00:16:47.292 --> 00:16:52.788
made right now as we speak,
mostly by non-demographers.

00:16:52.788 --> 00:16:56.134
Demographers have all learned
they can't believe projections

00:16:56.134 --> 00:16:57.100
as predictions.
 

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.655
Non-demographers haven't
learned that lesson or don't

00:17:00.655 --> 00:17:04.096
want to learn that lesson,
and they use these projections

00:17:04.096 --> 00:17:07.365
to forecast decline of the West,
and decline of the Soviet

00:17:07.365 --> 00:17:10.330
Union, decline of Russia,
decline of Italy,

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.420
whatever category they want to
talk about.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.113
What about--I said there were a
few very distinguished

00:17:16.113 --> 00:17:17.788
demographers who also did this?
 

00:17:17.788 --> 00:17:22.365
Yes, the most prominent was the
great French demographer Alfred

00:17:22.365 --> 00:17:26.718
Sauvy, a very distinguished man
indeed, probably the dean of

00:17:26.718 --> 00:17:28.490
French demographers.
 

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.717
He did this kind of
relationship of low fertility

00:17:32.717 --> 00:17:37.121
equals decline for most of his
professional career,

00:17:37.121 --> 00:17:39.500
for 40 years basically.
 

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:45.343
Let me just list for you some
of the events in history that he

00:17:45.343 --> 00:17:49.750
attributed to fertility rates
being too low.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:55.482
He said the decadence of
ancient Athens and then of Rome,

00:17:55.482 --> 00:17:56.608
item one.
 

00:17:56.608 --> 00:18:01.390
The failure of France to
industrialize,

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:05.750
the decline of the French Navy
in the nineteenth century,

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:11.799
the collapse of the French army
before the Germans in 1940.

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:14.670
He used very evocative language.
 

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.772
He said, for example,
"The terrible failure of

00:18:18.772 --> 00:18:21.516
1940,
more moral than material,

00:18:21.516 --> 00:18:26.440
must be linked in part to this
dangerous sclerosis resulting

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.358
from low birthrates.
 

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:33.073
We saw all too often during the
occupation,"

00:18:33.073 --> 00:18:37.689
German occupation,
"old men leaning wearily

00:18:37.689 --> 00:18:40.930
towards the servile solution.
 

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.157
At the time that the
young," that's the

00:18:44.157 --> 00:18:47.510
resistance,
"were taking part in the

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:51.558
national impulse towards
independence and liberty.

00:18:51.558 --> 00:18:56.328
This crucial effect of our
senility, is it not a grave

00:18:56.328 --> 00:18:57.230
warning?
 

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:02.615
Depopulation for France carries
with it, fatally,

00:19:02.615 --> 00:19:06.880
a general legacy of
decadence."

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.828
You see how powerful the
rhetoric can be in this area.

00:19:11.828 --> 00:19:16.619
I do not want you to get the
impression that demographers

00:19:16.619 --> 00:19:22.009
shared these lifelong concern
about fertility being too low,

00:19:22.009 --> 00:19:25.632
to the contrary,
they were not widely shared

00:19:25.632 --> 00:19:30.771
among demographers after all the
gloomy forecasts of the 1930s

00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:32.710
proved to be wrong.
 

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:36.150
The past is one of confusion
and anxiety.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.358
What about the future?
 

00:19:37.358 --> 00:19:39.493
I'd say it's likely to be a
future of great

00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:40.460
unpredictability.
 

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:46.929
The truth is that currently we
are in a period of low fertility

00:19:46.929 --> 00:19:52.460
rates that are without precedent
in their lowness,

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.086
if you will,
their smallness and without

00:19:55.086 --> 00:19:59.400
precedent in how widespread they
have become around the world.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.048
Having no precedent we actually
lack any way of knowing if they

00:20:04.048 --> 00:20:07.200
will continue at these very low
levels,

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.593
if they'll rise somewhat,
perhaps even above the magic

00:20:12.593 --> 00:20:17.584
2.11 replacement level,
or could they decline further

00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:22.435
to levels such as the league
table leaders with low fertility

00:20:22.435 --> 00:20:25.671
which would be surprisingly
enough Italy,

00:20:25.671 --> 00:20:27.450
Spain, Hong Kong.
 

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.690
We don't know.
 

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:32.345
Anybody who tells you they
know, you should not believe,

00:20:32.345 --> 00:20:34.338
they have no way of knowing.
 

00:20:34.338 --> 00:20:38.362
We do know that the very low
fertility of 1930s was short

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:42.744
lived but then was followed by a
substantial baby boom in some

00:20:42.744 --> 00:20:47.630
countries that had low fertility
in the 1930s and not in others.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:52.297
All I can say to you is why
don't you all come back for your

00:20:52.297 --> 00:20:56.805
fiftieth reunion at Yale in 50
years and we'll have a talk

00:20:56.805 --> 00:21:00.838
about whether fertility rates
stayed very low,

00:21:00.838 --> 00:21:04.019
went lower, or rose in these
countries that were very low.

00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:09.538
That's the only way we're ever
going to know.

00:21:09.538 --> 00:21:13.339
This graph will surely be wrong
as a prediction,

00:21:13.339 --> 00:21:15.118
I will predict that.
 

00:21:15.118 --> 00:21:19.394
There's an irony here,
we have moved from a society in

00:21:19.394 --> 00:21:23.748
which 90% of women have no
effective control over their

00:21:23.748 --> 00:21:28.667
fertility to a society in which
90% of women do have effective

00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:33.354
control of their fertility,
rational control of their

00:21:33.354 --> 00:21:34.210
fertility.
 

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.348
The result is that analysts,
demographers and you,

00:21:38.348 --> 00:21:42.971
are less able to rationally
anticipate what they will

00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:47.058
collectively do now that they
individually,

00:21:47.058 --> 00:21:51.808
rationally have control over
their fertility.

00:21:51.808 --> 00:21:55.250
A very wide range of population
projections is plausible,

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.366
that's just a narrow range
compared to some you could do if

00:21:58.366 --> 00:22:01.401
you wanted to make--
these are quite conservative

00:22:01.401 --> 00:22:04.509
assumptions on the high side and
the low side.

00:22:04.509 --> 00:22:10.160
Under these kinds of conditions
of really profound uncertainty,

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.391
can we offer any cautious
interpretations of historical

00:22:13.391 --> 00:22:17.102
experience that might provide us
with some kind of insight into

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:18.000
the future?
 

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.846
Well I'll offer a few and you
can shoot me down if you would

00:22:21.846 --> 00:22:22.890
like to do so.
 

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:26.938
First, I think it's nearly
inevitable that we'll see

00:22:26.938 --> 00:22:31.463
populations with much older age
structures, much older age

00:22:31.463 --> 00:22:34.640
compositions then those of the
past.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.538
That's the consequence of low
fertility.

00:22:37.538 --> 00:22:40.660
Of course if there's a nuclear
catastrophe or some other

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.420
catastrophe all bets are off.
 

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.134
None of these projections or
future looks can assume

00:22:47.134 --> 00:22:48.430
catastrophe.
 

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.324
The only way to return to the
youthful age structures of the

00:22:52.324 --> 00:22:56.086
past would be to have very
substantial fertility increases

00:22:56.086 --> 00:22:59.386
to those of the past and to
sustain those very high

00:22:59.386 --> 00:23:00.838
fertility rates.
 

00:23:00.838 --> 00:23:04.657
This in turn would apply--would
imply rapid population,

00:23:04.657 --> 00:23:06.848
increase ad infinitum.
 

00:23:06.848 --> 00:23:09.980
I think most of you know that
that's not likely to happen.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:16.901
Now my other point here is that
societies that have very low

00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:21.281
fertility rates,
like 1.1 child per woman on

00:23:21.281 --> 00:23:25.108
average that you might find in
Italy or Japan,

00:23:25.108 --> 00:23:28.808
Japan's a little higher but 1.3
in Japan.

00:23:28.808 --> 00:23:32.390
I think it would be
desirable--this is a value

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:36.188
judgment on my part,
it would be desirable for

00:23:36.188 --> 00:23:40.992
fertility rates to rise somewhat
to more moderate levels but I

00:23:40.992 --> 00:23:45.953
don't think they will ever rise
in those countries to the levels

00:23:45.953 --> 00:23:47.529
pre-transition.
 

00:23:47.529 --> 00:23:51.507
The challenge is going to be
find creative mechanisms to

00:23:51.507 --> 00:23:55.702
smooth the transition from
younger to older demographic age

00:23:55.702 --> 00:23:59.970
structures and to put in place
adaptive mechanisms that will

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:04.526
allow such societies to prosper
over the longer term under these

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:06.190
new conditions.
 

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.711
The second point I'd like to
make is that we are in danger

00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:12.616
collectively of making two
errors of demographic

00:24:12.616 --> 00:24:16.140
interpretation and these are
both significant errors.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.785
First, we are in danger of
putting undue emphasis upon what

00:24:19.785 --> 00:24:21.420
are called period rates.
 

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.288
Have you discussed period rates?
 

00:24:23.288 --> 00:24:26.088
Prof: There's a reading
from the last lecture.

00:24:26.088 --> 00:24:27.640
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 Okay.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.750
We are in danger of focusing on
period rates.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:34.541
I've just done it myself;
1.1 child per woman for Italy,

00:24:34.541 --> 00:24:39.328
even though we know they are
distorted rates.

00:24:39.328 --> 00:24:42.531
They're well below the
underlying rates of how many

00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:46.182
children the average woman will
have when she finishes her

00:24:46.182 --> 00:24:48.680
childbearing,
that's a cohort rate.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.674
Second danger is--and we're
doing it every day,

00:24:53.674 --> 00:24:59.865
mis-specifying the category
aged and thereby misconstruing

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:03.450
what demographic aging means.
 

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.210
Let me say a few words about
both of those.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.769
In Italy, Spain,
Greece, Portugal,

00:25:07.769 --> 00:25:10.690
Ireland, countries like that in
Europe,

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.497
there have been significant
increases in the mean age of

00:25:13.497 --> 00:25:16.509
marriage and hence the mean age
of first birth typically.

00:25:16.509 --> 00:25:20.952
These are large increases by
demographic standards and they

00:25:20.952 --> 00:25:25.241
are large enough to cause
distortions in the period rates

00:25:25.241 --> 00:25:28.917
over the time period during
which the mean age of

00:25:28.917 --> 00:25:31.140
childbearing is rising.
 

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.000
This is a well known phenomenon
to demographers;

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.858
it's not well understood among
political leaderships.

00:25:38.858 --> 00:25:41.846
When I was working on The Hill
running a congressional

00:25:41.846 --> 00:25:44.517
committee,
I learned not to use the term

00:25:44.517 --> 00:25:48.324
'cohort,' because as soon as I
said cohort the Congressman

00:25:48.324 --> 00:25:51.192
would say,
'you mean your friends,

00:25:51.192 --> 00:25:52.368
your cohort?'
 

00:25:52.368 --> 00:25:55.048
I said 'no, no it's a
generation concept.'

00:25:55.048 --> 00:25:59.167
'Oh I don't get it,
don't bother me with the

00:25:59.167 --> 00:26:00.028
facts.'
 

00:26:00.028 --> 00:26:05.140
But even the term is
misunderstood.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.740
Given that it's really too easy
to distort,

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.632
for that kind of audience if
you want to make the case that

00:26:11.632 --> 00:26:15.391
we're all going to hell in a
hand basket to distort these

00:26:15.391 --> 00:26:18.880
period rates and say this is
what's going to continue

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.230
indefinitely into the future.
 

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.970
Prof: Can you just
say--repeat what period it is.

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:25.180
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 Period rate--

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:25.848
Prof: Not all of them
have read about it.

00:26:25.848 --> 00:26:28.970
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 Okay, a period rate is--

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.179
it is expressed--let's
say--let's take the total

00:26:32.179 --> 00:26:34.980
fertility rate which is a period
rate,

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.980
it is synthetic in the sense
that it is an attempt to

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:46.038
summarize the fertility behavior
let's say in 2009 of women,

00:26:46.038 --> 00:26:48.740
demographers care only about
women by the way,

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:53.400
of women of all ages.
 

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.650
It's the fertility rates of
women 15 to 19,20 to 24;

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:01.650
these are different cohorts as
you can see in 2009.

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.917
They're born in different years;
they each have a characteristic

00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:09.180
fertility rate by age.
 

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:15.696
If you sum up the rates of all
of those age groups in a given

00:27:15.696 --> 00:27:21.289
year you will get a period rate,
which is an attempt to

00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:25.603
summarize the overall fertility
behavior of the entire

00:27:25.603 --> 00:27:27.720
population of all ages.
 

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.715
Then we express it,
probably confusingly,

00:27:32.715 --> 00:27:39.710
in terms such as 1.1 child per
woman, or 2.1 children per

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:40.960
woman.
 

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:46.079
It's not actually any real
woman, it's a synthetic woman.

00:27:46.079 --> 00:27:48.078
Prof: The best kind.
 

00:27:48.078 --> 00:27:49.575
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 The best kind of women

00:27:49.575 --> 00:27:49.828
yeah.
 

00:27:49.828 --> 00:27:56.935
If you--another way to imagine
this--imagine you had 1,000

00:27:56.935 --> 00:27:59.680
female demographers.
 

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.759
That's a frightening prospect
when you think about it,

00:28:02.759 --> 00:28:07.778
and they formed a pact,
they were all age 15,

00:28:07.778 --> 00:28:11.836
so they're 15-year-old
demographers and they form a

00:28:11.836 --> 00:28:16.057
pact that they will bear
children collectively at the

00:28:16.057 --> 00:28:20.763
rate of each age group in that
year that they make the pact

00:28:20.763 --> 00:28:24.660
right through their reproductive
lifespan.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.019
At the end of their
reproductive lifespan,

00:28:28.019 --> 00:28:32.766
40 say or 45,
they collectively would have an

00:28:32.766 --> 00:28:39.560
average children ever born equal
to the total fertility rate for

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.521
that year,
but of course that would never

00:28:42.521 --> 00:28:42.880
happen.
 

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.914
I mean I'm just trying to give
you an--ask you to imagine what

00:28:46.914 --> 00:28:48.038
the rates mean.
 

00:28:48.038 --> 00:28:50.614
The problem with the
rates--well let me say what's

00:28:50.614 --> 00:28:52.190
good about the period rates.
 

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.982
They give you a summary of
what's going on in a year or in

00:28:55.982 --> 00:28:59.310
a five year period,
that's why it's called a period

00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.910
rate.
 

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:05.269
It's a current kind of summary
rate.

00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:09.317
The cohort rates don't do that,
they tell you how many children

00:29:09.317 --> 00:29:12.910
women age 45 today had through
their entire lifespan.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:17.218
The problem with the period
rates is that they can be

00:29:17.218 --> 00:29:22.190
distorted if women delay or
accelerate their childbearing.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:25.618
Each year if there's a delay
they may end up with the same

00:29:25.618 --> 00:29:29.108
number of children when they
finish their childbearing,

00:29:29.108 --> 00:29:31.980
but they stretch it out over
more years,

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.076
so the annual rates,
the period rates are depressed

00:29:35.076 --> 00:29:35.818
therefore.
 

00:29:35.818 --> 00:29:39.180
We know that's happening in
southern Europe,

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.250
we know it's not happening in
central Europe,

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.690
so low rates in central Europe
are not distorted in this way,

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.582
the low rates in southern
Europe are distorted in this

00:29:49.582 --> 00:29:49.910
way.
 

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.930
That's probably enough about
period rates.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:56.011
Now I've said the second
possible error is the

00:29:56.011 --> 00:29:59.438
mis-specification by
demographers and others of the

00:29:59.438 --> 00:30:02.588
boundaries of the age dependency
category.

00:30:02.588 --> 00:30:07.609
Convention, when do you get to
be aged dependent?

00:30:07.609 --> 00:30:10.650
The answer 65.
 

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.839
Where did that number come from?
 

00:30:12.839 --> 00:30:15.839
Arbitrary.
 

00:30:15.839 --> 00:30:17.328
Who came up with it?
 

00:30:17.328 --> 00:30:22.249
The people who designed the
Social Security Act of 1935 who

00:30:22.249 --> 00:30:27.167
had to decide at what age did a
person qualify for a Social

00:30:27.167 --> 00:30:28.950
Security pension.
 

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.618
Why did they say 65?
 

00:30:31.618 --> 00:30:34.762
Well actually initially they
were going to say 70 because

00:30:34.762 --> 00:30:38.132
they were copying Bismarck's
social insurance scheme from the

00:30:38.132 --> 00:30:41.664
nineteenth century,
and the Bismarck system you got

00:30:41.664 --> 00:30:43.779
your state pension at age 70.
 

00:30:43.779 --> 00:30:47.137
It was a time of mass
unemployment and so there was a

00:30:47.137 --> 00:30:50.755
desire to encourage older
workers to leave the work force

00:30:50.755 --> 00:30:53.920
to make room for unemployed
younger workers,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.798
so they moved it down by five
years, 65.

00:30:57.798 --> 00:31:02.739
It's been that way in the
statistics, in the data,

00:31:02.739 --> 00:31:04.048
ever since.
 

00:31:04.048 --> 00:31:09.376
Demographers have not adjusted
to the reality that the meaning

00:31:09.376 --> 00:31:14.790
of 65 in 1935 was very different
from the meaning of 65 in 2005

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:15.838
or 2009.
 

00:31:15.838 --> 00:31:21.034
That's a problem because we
will spend a lot of time

00:31:21.034 --> 00:31:27.450
calculating to the third decimal
place the aged dependency ratio

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:33.865
and yet we know that the meaning
of the boundary between working

00:31:33.865 --> 00:31:39.569
age and aged dependency is
increasingly out of touch with

00:31:39.569 --> 00:31:41.200
reality.
 

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.083
The same is true,
by the way, of the young

00:31:44.083 --> 00:31:48.107
dependency ratio,
youthful dependency ratio,

00:31:48.107 --> 00:31:54.351
which is usually set at age 15
or 19 on grounds that after that

00:31:54.351 --> 00:31:59.990
people become productive labor
force people like you.

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:05.045
That's all changed too but we
still stick to these boundaries

00:32:05.045 --> 00:32:10.185
and we're misleading ourselves
and everyone else I'm afraid by

00:32:10.185 --> 00:32:11.450
doing that.
 

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.390
There are a lot of alternatives
to this.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:17.461
I won't go into them but one
obvious possibility would be to

00:32:17.461 --> 00:32:21.601
shift the age boundaries upward
for both the youthful and the

00:32:21.601 --> 00:32:25.557
older boundaries,
say to 20 years and 70 years,

00:32:25.557 --> 00:32:29.338
rather than 15 and 65 that
would make sense.

00:32:29.338 --> 00:32:32.904
You'd want to keep the old
series as well because you would

00:32:32.904 --> 00:32:35.670
want to have some comparability
over time,

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:39.019
but to have an alternative
ratio would be useful.

00:32:39.019 --> 00:32:44.444
Another possibility would be to
fix the number of years of

00:32:44.444 --> 00:32:49.108
remaining life expectancy rather
than the age,

00:32:49.108 --> 00:32:54.813
the absolute age as the
boundary between aged dependency

00:32:54.813 --> 00:32:56.680
and working age.
 

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.840
Now let me talk a bit about
policy responses to very low

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.750
fertility.
 

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:05.933
There are basically two basic
types of policy responses that

00:33:05.933 --> 00:33:07.848
have been strongly urged.
 

00:33:07.848 --> 00:33:10.904
First measures to increase
fertility, that's a pretty

00:33:10.904 --> 00:33:14.077
obvious and direct one,
and second measures to adapt to

00:33:14.077 --> 00:33:16.368
low fertility over the longer
term.

00:33:16.368 --> 00:33:20.932
I am not embracing any of these
recommendations but I do want to

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:24.625
give you the analytic
possibilities that might--that

00:33:24.625 --> 00:33:26.509
have been put forward.
 

00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:31.086
First, and this will offend
most of you, it has been urged

00:33:31.086 --> 00:33:35.182
and implemented in some
countries to limit access to

00:33:35.182 --> 00:33:36.950
fertility control.
 

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.993
If you banned contraception,
abortion, etc.,

00:33:39.993 --> 00:33:43.180
sterilization,
fertility rates would go up.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:49.358
That's basically what Ceausescu
in Romania did in 1966.

00:33:49.358 --> 00:33:53.061
This would be probably
unworkable in a liberal

00:33:53.061 --> 00:33:54.048
democracy.
 

00:33:54.048 --> 00:33:58.030
Romania was not a liberal
democracy to say the least,

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:01.858
and it would be unacceptable in
many other ways.

00:34:01.858 --> 00:34:06.401
It would probably result in a
revolution in the United States,

00:34:06.401 --> 00:34:09.380
but that's analytically a
possibility.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:14.797
Second, economic incentives to
encourage higher fertility and

00:34:14.797 --> 00:34:18.768
these have come in many forms in
the past.

00:34:18.768 --> 00:34:22.289
How about cash bonuses for
bearing a child?

00:34:22.289 --> 00:34:25.458
Or allowances,
annual payments per child you

00:34:25.458 --> 00:34:28.483
have in the family,
from the government,

00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:31.639
or tax preferences to people
with children,

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.483
those are part of U.S.
 

00:34:33.483 --> 00:34:35.159
tax law, of course.
 

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:38.815
These can be flat,
meaning each child is treated

00:34:38.815 --> 00:34:43.559
the same in terms of the amount
of bonus or tax incentive,

00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:45.409
or they can be
"progressive"--

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:50.500
I guess you put that in
quotes--with increasing amounts

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.599
per--
for later births.

00:34:52.599 --> 00:34:56.679
You might give no incentive for
the first birth but a big

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:59.960
incentive for the third birth,
for example.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.539
You could give 'in-kind'
benefits.

00:35:02.539 --> 00:35:05.210
For example,
in much of Eastern Europe,

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:09.190
families with more than two
children had access to larger

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:11.981
and preferential flats,
preferred flats,

00:35:11.981 --> 00:35:13.039
government flats.
 

00:35:13.039 --> 00:35:17.161
They got preference in that way
or subsidized housing,

00:35:17.161 --> 00:35:21.440
or you could give early
retirement bonuses to people.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.782
You could say,
well a woman who has three or

00:35:23.782 --> 00:35:26.400
more children can retire at age
55 instead of 65,

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.090
that would be an incentive.
 

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:33.882
In both the Soviet Union in the
1930s and in Nazi Germany in the

00:35:33.882 --> 00:35:36.567
1930s,
women got prizes,

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:40.610
gold medals,
mother heroine awards,

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.599
gold medals for eight or more
children,

00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:46.440
for example,
in the Soviet Union.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:50.282
You could counterweight
existing dis-incentives to large

00:35:50.282 --> 00:35:54.719
families for example,
by facilitating female labor

00:35:54.719 --> 00:36:00.340
force participation for women
who have children in various

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.978
ways;
the French Crèche System

00:36:02.978 --> 00:36:05.900
which is a government financed
early childhood,

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.831
before the schools start,
system of childcare is an

00:36:09.831 --> 00:36:11.719
example of doing that.
 

00:36:11.719 --> 00:36:14.989
The Swedish government has lots
of policies of this kind.

00:36:14.989 --> 00:36:19.730
Those are benign examples but
there are some harsh examples.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:23.393
You could take measures to
deter female labor force

00:36:23.393 --> 00:36:27.496
participation on grounds that
you think it conflicts with

00:36:27.496 --> 00:36:29.110
maternal behavior.
 

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:34.804
Now among Western countries,
there have really been only a

00:36:34.804 --> 00:36:40.900
few that have adopted explicitly
pronatalist policies of these

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:41.900
kinds.
 

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:49.110
France, Luxemburg,
Greece, Quebec come to mind,

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:52.632
although other countries have
policies they do not describe as

00:36:52.632 --> 00:36:55.510
pronatalist policies,
they say they're social

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:58.815
policies, but they have the
implicit effect of being

00:36:58.815 --> 00:37:02.510
pronatalist and they don't
acknowledge that typically.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:07.317
In France there have been
proposals never adopted for an

00:37:07.317 --> 00:37:10.684
official maternal wage,
and it's called that,

00:37:10.684 --> 00:37:13.711
in which mothers who stay at
home with young children would

00:37:13.711 --> 00:37:16.059
get monthly payments from the
government,

00:37:16.059 --> 00:37:20.021
they get paid to be mothers
that would be calculated in

00:37:20.021 --> 00:37:24.646
those proposals at about 25% of
the prevailing wage for employed

00:37:24.646 --> 00:37:25.380
women.
 

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.672
In the socialist countries,
former socialist countries of

00:37:28.672 --> 00:37:30.965
eastern Europe,
there were lots of these

00:37:30.965 --> 00:37:31.730
policies.
 

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.853
They've all disappeared or
almost all have disappeared

00:37:34.853 --> 00:37:37.329
since the fall of the communist
system,

00:37:37.329 --> 00:37:39.800
but those countries had child
allowances,

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:43.264
birth bonuses,
maternity leave at full pay for

00:37:43.264 --> 00:37:47.099
five months,
paid leave until the child is

00:37:47.099 --> 00:37:51.965
three years of age,
and substantial subsidies and

00:37:51.965 --> 00:37:53.579
grants in kind.
 

00:37:53.579 --> 00:37:56.534
The only non-Western low
fertility country that's pursued

00:37:56.534 --> 00:37:59.110
this kind of policy,
that I'm familiar with it so

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.018
far at least,
but there will be others almost

00:38:01.018 --> 00:38:03.110
surely,
is Singapore.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:07.391
Singapore has embraced strong
pronatalist policies and there

00:38:07.391 --> 00:38:10.655
have been some modest ones in
Korea, Thailand,

00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:11.889
and Malaysia.
 

00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:14.503
In Singapore too they have
policies about encouraging

00:38:14.503 --> 00:38:17.420
highly educated young men and
women to meet each other,

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.900
they have dating services,
they want them to meet each

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.329
other and marry and have
children,

00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:26.190
which always causes amusement
outside of Singapore.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:30.255
They don't think it's funny;
they think it's perfectly

00:38:30.255 --> 00:38:31.110
sensible.
 

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:35.802
It's fair to say that the
impacts of these policies on

00:38:35.802 --> 00:38:40.940
fertility are probably there,
but they're small impacts.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:44.472
In some countries they were
very expensive policies as well,

00:38:44.472 --> 00:38:46.570
but they didn't have much
impact.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:51.250
If you tried to do the kinds of
things that eastern European

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:56.168
socialist countries did in the
1980s proportionately in Western

00:38:56.168 --> 00:38:59.579
countries the costs would be
enormous,

00:38:59.579 --> 00:39:05.971
1/3 to 1/2 of average wages for
a family with two or three

00:39:05.971 --> 00:39:10.719
children for example;
the cost would be very large.

00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:14.346
Now what about measures to
adapt to low fertility over the

00:39:14.346 --> 00:39:15.110
long term?
 

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:18.849
Well, first it's easier to
adapt if the shifts are gradual,

00:39:18.849 --> 00:39:22.059
so very low fertility countries
having dramatic shifts in the

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:24.213
age structure,
it makes it much harder for

00:39:24.213 --> 00:39:24.489
them.
 

00:39:24.489 --> 00:39:28.094
Then I've already mentioned the
question of the boundaries

00:39:28.094 --> 00:39:31.942
between dependency and so on,
I won't repeat that,

00:39:31.942 --> 00:39:37.500
but it's fair to say that the
elderly dependent population,

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.826
however defined,
is going to cost more than the

00:39:41.826 --> 00:39:47.980
youthful dependent population,
mainly because of healthcare.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.465
Education is the main public
investment in youthful dependent

00:39:51.465 --> 00:39:54.601
population, the rest of the
costs of those children are

00:39:54.601 --> 00:39:55.880
borne by families.
 

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.226
When it comes to the aged
dependent population the

00:39:59.226 --> 00:40:03.188
families are no longer paying
the costs, and the healthcare

00:40:03.188 --> 00:40:05.579
costs are very high and rising.
 

00:40:05.579 --> 00:40:09.786
Here I would have to say that,
of the industrialized countries

00:40:09.786 --> 00:40:11.233
of the West, the U.S.
 

00:40:11.233 --> 00:40:14.130
has the largest problem in this
regard.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:17.175
Not because it has the oldest
age structure or the most

00:40:17.175 --> 00:40:19.320
rapidly growing elderly
population,

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.981
but because it is politically
incapable of controlling it's

00:40:22.981 --> 00:40:26.768
expenditure on healthcare and
that's a generic problem in the

00:40:26.768 --> 00:40:30.344
society,
but it has special import for

00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:32.909
the elderly age structure.
 

00:40:32.909 --> 00:40:35.570
What could governments do?
 

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:38.139
Well they could modify the
terms of the social pension

00:40:38.139 --> 00:40:40.121
provisions,
they could shift the effective

00:40:40.121 --> 00:40:42.492
age of retirement,
they could privatize part of

00:40:42.492 --> 00:40:46.172
the pension system,
they could subject pension

00:40:46.172 --> 00:40:52.260
benefits of well off retirees to
substantial income taxation.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.215
But, in fact,
the politics of pension policy

00:40:55.215 --> 00:40:59.547
in most of these countries have
operated in the other direction,

00:40:59.547 --> 00:41:01.610
in the opposite direction.
 

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.202
Most countries,
if anything,

00:41:03.202 --> 00:41:06.626
have taken measures to lower
the pension age until recently

00:41:06.626 --> 00:41:10.168
when they've started gradually
now to reverse the lowering of

00:41:10.168 --> 00:41:12.590
pension ages that they engaged
in,

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:14.599
in the 1960s and 1970s.
 

00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:17.568
As far as the youthful
population is concerned,

00:41:17.568 --> 00:41:21.699
it's going to be smaller with
these low fertility populations.

00:41:21.699 --> 00:41:25.320
Well, one could certainly
convert age related facilities,

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.039
such as schools,
for other purposes,

00:41:28.039 --> 00:41:30.922
and going forward,
it would make a lot of sense to

00:41:30.922 --> 00:41:34.688
design new schools in a flexible
way so they're easier to convert

00:41:34.688 --> 00:41:39.329
for other purposes,
which leads me finally to

00:41:39.329 --> 00:41:41.010
immigration.
 

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:45.855
Immigration is often put
forward as a way to deal with an

00:41:45.855 --> 00:41:47.500
aging population.
 

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:53.177
The truth is that the potential
pool of immigrants to low

00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:57.132
fertility countries,
the potential pool,

00:41:57.132 --> 00:42:02.000
is very large and it could
easily be tapped.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.005
In fact, many of these
countries are having problems

00:42:05.005 --> 00:42:08.483
restraining the flow which is
exceeding what they would like

00:42:08.483 --> 00:42:09.250
it to be.
 

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:12.590
It would be quite simple for a
low fertility country,

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.860
any one of the ones I've
mentioned,

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.990
to simply augment their
populations by allowing

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:18.150
additional immigration.
 

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:22.153
That sounds a lot easier than
changing the pension system and

00:42:22.153 --> 00:42:24.090
then all the other systems.
 

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:28.623
Now let me take you back to my
point about concerns about low

00:42:28.623 --> 00:42:32.780
fertility not being about the
number of warm bodies,

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:37.960
but about the numbers defined
as part of the nation or other

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:43.829
ethnic or cultural group,
so that's the paradox.

00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:46.989
Under conditions of very low
fertility,

00:42:46.989 --> 00:42:50.561
substantial immigration would
produce very rapid

00:42:50.561 --> 00:42:54.210
transformation of the
composition of a population

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:58.001
socio-culturally defined,
and historically such rapid

00:42:58.001 --> 00:43:00.800
changes have led to passionate
public opposition.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:06.679
The irony here is that,
while you might think,

00:43:06.679 --> 00:43:09.626
as an analyst,
sitting here in lecture room at

00:43:09.626 --> 00:43:13.358
Yale that why not just have more
warm bodies immigrate and

00:43:13.358 --> 00:43:15.650
that'll take care of the issue.
 

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:20.045
It's exactly in a low fertility
setting that the public

00:43:20.045 --> 00:43:24.117
opposition is strongest to
increased or substantial

00:43:24.117 --> 00:43:25.420
immigration.
 

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:29.429
There are some examples in
which immigration can be of--

00:43:29.429 --> 00:43:32.929
by people who are defined as
part of,

00:43:32.929 --> 00:43:35.179
or similar to,
the indigenous population,

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:38.030
and in those cases,
there's less--typically less

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:40.880
opposition and I can give you a
few examples.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:46.932
Like the post war migration of
East Germans to West Germany,

00:43:46.932 --> 00:43:48.369
for example.
 

00:43:48.369 --> 00:43:52.018
Or the Germans,
so called Germans --

00:43:52.018 --> 00:43:57.440
the Volga Germans--from Russia
to Germany which turned out to

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.422
be quite controversial,
but they were defined as

00:44:01.422 --> 00:44:05.161
Germans returning home even
though they're ancestors had

00:44:05.161 --> 00:44:06.929
left 300 years earlier.
 

00:44:06.929 --> 00:44:12.690
The Pied Noir's to France after
the collapse of the French

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:17.934
Empire, in Africa mostly;
the "return"-- think

00:44:17.934 --> 00:44:20.702
about that, the
"return"

00:44:20.702 --> 00:44:25.400
of Jews from North Africa to
the new state of Israel;

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:32.032
of Italians or Italian
Argentineans rather,

00:44:32.032 --> 00:44:37.447
to Italy;
of Japanese origin people,

00:44:37.447 --> 00:44:43.250
the Nisei from Brazil and Peru
to Japan;

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:47.643
of Angolan colonial settlers to
Portugal, so there are examples

00:44:47.643 --> 00:44:51.400
of this kind of migration being
less controversial.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.371
I think one should also say
that moderate levels of

00:44:54.371 --> 00:44:57.760
immigration do not appear to be
all that controversial.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:01.554
This is not a question of
people being passionately

00:45:01.554 --> 00:45:04.742
against immigration,
but it's a question of

00:45:04.742 --> 00:45:05.730
quantity.
 

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:09.782
This will lead me,
if I can get this to move

00:45:09.782 --> 00:45:15.722
forward--here's a Jacque Chirac
quote which I meant to show you,

00:45:15.722 --> 00:45:18.079
I'll let you read it.
 

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:38.032
You see Chirac was saying that
in 2004,--we already know what

00:45:38.032 --> 00:45:44.804
the population was in 2004--but
that Europe would be empty in

00:45:44.804 --> 00:45:45.820
2004.
 

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:49.762
He said that in 1984 and one
thing the demographers have

00:45:49.762 --> 00:45:53.559
learned is never make a
prediction over a time span in

00:45:53.559 --> 00:45:58.003
which you might still be alive
because you will probably always

00:45:58.003 --> 00:46:05.530
be wrong;
Chirac was clearly wrong.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:07.849
What I want to talk about is a
study,

00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:10.320
and this will be my last
section here,

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:16.438
a study of the question of
substituting immigration for

00:46:16.438 --> 00:46:21.650
missed fertility in low
fertility societies.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:25.710
There was a study done by the
United Nations Population

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:27.139
Division in 2000.
 

00:46:27.139 --> 00:46:30.630
It asked the question,
how many immigrants would be

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:34.190
needed to compensate for low
fertility in Europe?

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:38.619
The answer was: A lot.
 

00:46:38.619 --> 00:46:42.438
This was no surprise to the UN
Population Division or to

00:46:42.438 --> 00:46:46.190
demographers,
but it was a surprise to The

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:51.201
New York Times,
which in 2001 ran this

00:46:51.201 --> 00:46:58.123
story--or 2000 I guess it is,
back in January 2000 ran this

00:46:58.123 --> 00:47:03.550
story picked up by The Herald
Tribune in Paris and so on,

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:07.090
about this study.
 

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:10.889
I know a little bit about the
history of why it was published

00:47:10.889 --> 00:47:15.050
on the 2^(nd) of January 2000,
which I can tell you because

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:18.010
it's a story about how the press
works.

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:22.722
The study had been filed months
before by the journalist Barbara

00:47:22.722 --> 00:47:25.657
Croset,
and was literally filed in a

00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.186
file cabinet,
had not been published,

00:47:28.186 --> 00:47:30.309
and then on the second of
January,

00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:32.539
day after New Year's,
slow news day,

00:47:32.539 --> 00:47:35.739
nothing was happening,
the editor on duty said,

00:47:35.739 --> 00:47:39.838
'oh we have that story from six
months ago let's just throw that

00:47:39.838 --> 00:47:40.880
in the paper.'
 

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.449
They put it in the paper,
it had already been written and

00:47:43.449 --> 00:47:48.529
edited,
and notice the headline here,

00:47:48.529 --> 00:47:53.315
the subhead,
'It's The American Way,' you

00:47:53.315 --> 00:47:58.701
can imagine how this appealed to
the nationalists in various

00:47:58.701 --> 00:48:00.710
European countries.
 

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:04.974
Europe stares at a future built
by immigrants,

00:48:04.974 --> 00:48:07.250
it's the American way.
 

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:13.340
The reaction was described to
me by the head of the UN

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:17.250
population division in one word.
 

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:19.719
He said it was
"mayhem."

00:48:19.719 --> 00:48:24.981
They started to get calls
almost immediately from almost

00:48:24.981 --> 00:48:27.659
every newspaper in Europe.
 

00:48:27.659 --> 00:48:32.103
The Secretary General of the
United Nations got calls from

00:48:32.103 --> 00:48:35.465
most European countries,
from the governments,

00:48:35.465 --> 00:48:38.458
and not surprisingly the
Secretary General's office

00:48:38.458 --> 00:48:41.570
called over to the Population
Division and said,

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:45.760
'could you please send us the
study.'

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.420
The truth is,
there was no study.

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:54.289
They had done some back of the
envelope calculations and had

00:48:54.289 --> 00:48:58.992
done a one page talking point
thing for a General Assembly

00:48:58.992 --> 00:49:03.119
meeting that they thought it
might come up at.

00:49:03.119 --> 00:49:07.436
What they did was a press
release that was I think two

00:49:07.436 --> 00:49:10.202
pages,
summarizing the back of the

00:49:10.202 --> 00:49:15.686
envelope calculations,
and within a few days Le

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:24.809
Monde story here,
here's the press release.

00:49:24.809 --> 00:49:30.445
Here's Le Monde,
I think, and Le Monde

00:49:30.445 --> 00:49:37.077
actually dropped the question
mark at the end of the title of

00:49:37.077 --> 00:49:39.510
the press release.
 

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:42.577
You see there,
the press release says,

00:49:42.577 --> 00:49:47.306
"Replacement Migration,
Is It A Solution To Declining

00:49:47.306 --> 00:49:49.960
And Aging Populations?"
 

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:56.833
and Le Monde translated
it as 'a solution to declining,

00:49:56.833 --> 00:49:59.199
etc., populations.'
 

00:49:59.199 --> 00:50:04.849
There was suddenly a big story
in Europe,

00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:10.329
here we have Le Figaro,
the report that alarmed Europe,

00:50:10.329 --> 00:50:15.559
it was translated--I think
there's an Economist

00:50:15.559 --> 00:50:17.039
article here.
 

00:50:17.039 --> 00:50:19.199
Here's a cartoon from
Figaro saying,

00:50:19.199 --> 00:50:24.449
what's the distance from Europe
to the United Nations,

00:50:24.449 --> 00:50:27.980
etc., a man and a woman talking
over the--

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.909
about that.
 

00:50:28.909 --> 00:50:33.909
Here's The Economist,
fewer and wrinklier Europeans--

00:50:33.909 --> 00:50:40.059
all the major German newspapers
had articles,

00:50:40.059 --> 00:50:44.268
Belgium, Spanish,
Italian, the French TV main

00:50:44.268 --> 00:50:49.913
channel sent crews to the UN to
interview the authors of the

00:50:49.913 --> 00:50:50.869
study.
 

00:50:50.869 --> 00:50:54.219
There was still no study.
 

00:50:54.219 --> 00:50:58.349
All there was was that press
release that you saw before.

00:50:58.349 --> 00:51:02.041
Well for some reason the
Secretary General took the view

00:51:02.041 --> 00:51:06.070
that they should now do the
study and they did the study,

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:10.954
and unfortunately what happened
was that the press in Europe

00:51:10.954 --> 00:51:15.425
interpreted the UN study or the
press release as the UN

00:51:15.425 --> 00:51:19.481
recommendation to European
countries to admit more

00:51:19.481 --> 00:51:20.889
immigrants.
 

00:51:20.889 --> 00:51:24.773
"The United Nations is
preparing a new report which

00:51:24.773 --> 00:51:28.940
will argue that Europe may need
to accept many more migrants

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:32.826
over the next 50 years to
maintain population levels and

00:51:32.826 --> 00:51:35.510
the size of its workforce."
 

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:38.219
It's not--they did do the
study, very quickly.

00:51:38.219 --> 00:51:40.590
It's not what the study did.
 

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:44.414
This is an inventory of all the
articles that were published

00:51:44.414 --> 00:51:46.099
after the press release.
 

00:51:46.099 --> 00:51:49.030
What did they actually find?
 

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:52.626
Well what they did were
hypothetical scenarios to 2050

00:51:52.626 --> 00:51:56.360
and they asked the following
questions among others,

00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:00.588
how many immigrants would key
countries need to prevent

00:52:00.588 --> 00:52:04.885
decline in the total population,
assuming that their projections

00:52:04.885 --> 00:52:10.030
on fertility were accurate,
to hold constant the population

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:13.876
15 to 65,
there we are again with those

00:52:13.876 --> 00:52:18.199
15 and 65 age boundaries,
and to hold constant what they

00:52:18.199 --> 00:52:22.315
call the potential support ratio
which they defined as the ratio

00:52:22.315 --> 00:52:27.056
of people of working age,
meaning 15 to 64 to those who

00:52:27.056 --> 00:52:32.480
are aged dependent,
meaning 65 and over.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.514
For the last,
which was in a way the most

00:52:36.514 --> 00:52:41.440
important one,
here were the numbers they came

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:48.280
up with: that Germany would need
188 million immigrants by 2050,

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:52.000
at which point 80% of the
population within the boundaries

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.916
of Germany would be represented
by those immigrants and their

00:52:55.916 --> 00:52:56.829
offspring.
 

00:52:56.829 --> 00:53:00.478
Italy would need 120 million,
and you see the percentages

00:53:00.478 --> 00:53:03.230
here,
always 4/5^(ths) of the

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:08.659
population would be accounted
for by immigrants and their

00:53:08.659 --> 00:53:09.920
offspring.
 

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.864
The U.S., even the U.S.
 

00:53:11.864 --> 00:53:16.851
which would need 593 million
immigrants would be at 73% even

00:53:16.851 --> 00:53:19.809
with its higher fertility rates.
 

00:53:19.809 --> 00:53:24.141
The paradox here is that if you
combine low fertility with high

00:53:24.141 --> 00:53:28.713
immigration,
from an economic view or let's

00:53:28.713 --> 00:53:33.530
say our Yale undergraduate
perspective,

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:36.139
immigrants or substitutes are
complements,

00:53:36.139 --> 00:53:38.210
they're workers,
they have skills,

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:41.605
they bring skills,
they pay taxes,

00:53:41.605 --> 00:53:48.110
they subsidize retirement for
older residents.

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:51.070
But the public view is that
immigrants are human beings,

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:53.190
that they have cultures,
religions,

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:57.289
politics, languages,
so if fertility is low,

00:53:57.289 --> 00:54:03.159
immigration is less acceptable
to public's than if fertility is

00:54:03.159 --> 00:54:04.768
high or higher.
 

00:54:04.768 --> 00:54:08.822
Meanwhile, elites like us,
take that more economic

00:54:08.822 --> 00:54:09.980
perspective.
 

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:14.876
I think probably if we did a
survey of this group we would be

00:54:14.876 --> 00:54:19.447
more positive about increasing
immigration then would the

00:54:19.447 --> 00:54:21.079
public at large.
 

00:54:21.079 --> 00:54:26.659
The outcomes of this are really
unknowable.

00:54:26.659 --> 00:54:29.793
There's been a lot of heat,
there hasn't been a lot of

00:54:29.793 --> 00:54:32.039
light about international
migration.

00:54:32.039 --> 00:54:38.260
The data are weak,
fertility data are much better,

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.820
mortality data are the best
demographic data,

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.230
fertility data are the second
best,

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:46.050
migration data are by far the
worst.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:50.215
They are very weak,
but we think there are about

00:54:50.215 --> 00:54:54.913
200 million international
migrants around now and that

00:54:54.913 --> 00:54:58.989
it's gone up about 2/3^(rds) in
15 years,

00:54:58.989 --> 00:55:03.518
increasing at about 2.3 million
per year.

00:55:03.518 --> 00:55:06.860
If you put them all together
where do they fit?

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:11.050
200 million would be the fifth
largest population in the world,

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:14.972
so it's a non-trivial number,
but it's a very small fraction

00:55:14.972 --> 00:55:21.429
of the world's population,
like 3% or less.

00:55:21.429 --> 00:55:24.659
We have tens of millions of
people migrating,

00:55:24.659 --> 00:55:27.742
but overwhelmingly,
the majority of people do not

00:55:27.742 --> 00:55:30.054
migrate,
so just keep all of those

00:55:30.054 --> 00:55:33.518
paradoxes in your head about
international migration.

00:55:33.518 --> 00:55:35.445
In absolute terms,
the U.S.

00:55:35.445 --> 00:55:39.150
has the largest number of
foreign-born people at 35

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:42.485
million in 2000,
and The Russian Federation is

00:55:42.485 --> 00:55:43.300
next.
 

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:46.260
Here, if you can read that,
I guess you can,

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:47.500
you see the U.S.
 

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:51.496
at the top there,
The Russian Federation and then

00:55:51.496 --> 00:55:56.574
the other countries are a lot
smaller in terms of foreign-born

00:55:56.574 --> 00:55:57.739
residents.
 

00:55:57.739 --> 00:56:01.376
If you look though at the
percent of the population you

00:56:01.376 --> 00:56:05.213
get a different list then the
one I just showed you of the

00:56:05.213 --> 00:56:07.099
different league table .
 

00:56:07.099 --> 00:56:11.050
The Persian Gulf states have
the highest percentage of the

00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:15.139
populations who are immigrants
or international migrants.

00:56:15.139 --> 00:56:17.840
Largely because they have
substantial numbers,

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:20.865
small compared to the U.S.,
but substantial numbers of

00:56:20.865 --> 00:56:24.293
international migrants of the
base of a very small indigenous

00:56:24.293 --> 00:56:25.150
population.
 

00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:27.860
Most of their migrants are
temporary workers;

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:31.498
they are not immigrants in the
sense that they're allowed to

00:56:31.498 --> 00:56:32.670
stay permanently.
 

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:36.768
You have 3/4^(ths) of the
populations of the United Arab

00:56:36.768 --> 00:56:41.315
Emirates and the Qatar who are
foreign born and more than half

00:56:41.315 --> 00:56:42.360
in Kuwait.
 

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:46.050
I say here that Israel and
Jordan are about 40%,

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:49.199
it depends on how you define
the Palestinians in Jordan,

00:56:49.199 --> 00:56:53.492
but if you call them
international migrants then it's

00:56:53.492 --> 00:56:55.309
40% or so in Jordan.
 

00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:58.610
Then you can find a few
European countries but they're

00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:00.442
tiny,
like Lichtenstein,

00:57:00.442 --> 00:57:04.289
that have high percentages of
foreign born people,

00:57:04.289 --> 00:57:06.762
but generally speaking,
the highest percentages are in

00:57:06.762 --> 00:57:09.190
small countries and here's the
league table there.

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:12.110
I don't know if you can read
it, United Arab Emirates,

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:14.588
Kuwait, Jordan,
Israel, Singapore,

00:57:14.588 --> 00:57:17.119
Oman,
Estonia, Saudi Arabia,

00:57:17.119 --> 00:57:21.289
Latvia, Switzerland,
Australia, New Zealand,

00:57:21.289 --> 00:57:23.139
Gabon, and Canada.
 

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:28.038
You see the big countries don't
by and large appear in that

00:57:28.038 --> 00:57:29.389
league table .
 

00:57:29.389 --> 00:57:32.920
If you look at countries that
have 50 million or more,

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:36.434
so we're starting about--we're
starting to talk about

00:57:36.434 --> 00:57:39.070
significant population of
countries,

00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:43.239
the percent of foreign born
exceeds 10% in only three such

00:57:43.239 --> 00:57:45.976
countries,
in the Ukraine,

00:57:45.976 --> 00:57:49.309
in the U.S.,
and in France.

00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:52.967
The Russian Federation and
Germany are getting--are pretty

00:57:52.967 --> 00:57:56.947
close so we should include them
probably, but there aren't many

00:57:56.947 --> 00:57:58.809
others that are above 5%.
 

00:57:58.809 --> 00:58:02.592
I've already said that low
fertility might imply increasing

00:58:02.592 --> 00:58:06.179
immigration and there are
plausible arguments about--

00:58:06.179 --> 00:58:10.184
in favor of that to meet the
labor force needs that employers

00:58:10.184 --> 00:58:13.914
say they have,
as there's more economic

00:58:13.914 --> 00:58:17.501
integration,
more international migration is

00:58:17.501 --> 00:58:20.554
inevitable,
and immigrants can arguably

00:58:20.554 --> 00:58:23.789
finance unsustainable pension
systems,

00:58:23.789 --> 00:58:26.090
pay as you earn pension systems.
 

00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:28.666
There are equally plausible
counterarguments,

00:58:28.666 --> 00:58:31.889
and you're just going to have
to decide for yourself.

00:58:31.889 --> 00:58:35.663
I don't think anyone can
convince you one way or another

00:58:35.663 --> 00:58:39.300
of what's right here,
or what's the proper mindset.

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:42.795
One argument here would be that
low fertility rates are likely

00:58:42.795 --> 00:58:45.994
going to be temporary,
that public opposition will

00:58:45.994 --> 00:58:49.461
prevent an increase of
international migration to very

00:58:49.461 --> 00:58:53.452
high levels and that these pay
as you earn pension systems are

00:58:53.452 --> 00:58:57.675
going to be restructured,
and I am firmly on the fence on

00:58:57.675 --> 00:58:58.099
this.
 

00:58:58.099 --> 00:59:02.579
I will sit uncomfortably on the
fence as long as I can stand it.

00:59:02.579 --> 00:59:06.664
It's painful to sit on the
fence, but in this case I don't

00:59:06.664 --> 00:59:10.750
think there's a clear correct
position on these things.

00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:14.601
Here are summary and
conclusions: very low fertility

00:59:14.601 --> 00:59:18.380
now is widespread and it's
continuing to spread.

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:22.679
I think--the last I looked and
don't quote me on this,

00:59:22.679 --> 00:59:27.795
but last I looked if you don't
include China because China

00:59:27.795 --> 00:59:30.963
tilts everything,
it's 20% of the world's

00:59:30.963 --> 00:59:32.889
population,
so let's be conservative and

00:59:32.889 --> 00:59:35.072
not include China,
which does have below

00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:36.760
replacement in fertility.
 

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.864
Without China,
40% of the world's population

00:59:39.864 --> 00:59:44.054
now lives in countries with
below replacement fertility and

00:59:44.054 --> 00:59:44.849
rising.
 

00:59:44.849 --> 00:59:50.818
With China, 60% of the world's
population live in such

00:59:50.818 --> 00:59:52.170
countries.
 

00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:55.909
In the past we know that these
low fertility rates,

00:59:55.909 --> 00:59:57.780
in fact, not as low as some of
the rates we see today,

00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:04.829
have led to exaggerated alarm
and to nationalist responses.

01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:08.195
Fertility rates could rise in
the future, there's nothing to

01:00:08.195 --> 01:00:08.880
stop them.
 

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.445
Most sociologists,
anthropologists,

01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:15.898
and demographers don't think
they will, but they have no way

01:00:15.898 --> 01:00:17.030
of knowing.
 

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:21.219
I don't think they will,
but I could easily be wrong.

01:00:21.219 --> 01:00:27.615
It's hard to increase fertility
rates via policy in liberal

01:00:27.615 --> 01:00:29.159
democracies.
 

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:32.811
Increased immigration is often
invoked as a solution to the

01:00:32.811 --> 01:00:36.525
problems resulting from very low
fertility but it's not very

01:00:36.525 --> 01:00:39.485
effective,
and it's likely to stimulate

01:00:39.485 --> 01:00:41.719
its own passionate opposition.
 

01:00:41.719 --> 01:00:45.440
My bottom line is,
and I'll stop with this,

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.469
that adaptive societies,
societies that are capable,

01:00:48.469 --> 01:00:51.268
flexible enough to adapt to
changing age structures,

01:00:51.268 --> 01:00:56.235
up and down and sideways,
are likely to fare the best in

01:00:56.235 --> 01:00:57.409
the future.
 

01:00:57.409 --> 01:01:08.190
Thank you.
 

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:12.576
Prof: I think we have
time to take questions--anybody

01:01:12.576 --> 01:01:13.320
has one?
 

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.101
Dr. Michael Tietelbaum:
 There have got to be some

01:01:16.101 --> 01:01:18.934
questions because I didn't
explain some things that I just

01:01:18.934 --> 01:01:19.679
asserted.
 

01:01:19.679 --> 01:01:22.719
Prof: Let me just start
off--and this is a biggee.

01:01:22.719 --> 01:01:24.059
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 Okay.

01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:26.460
Prof: I know there are
whole lectures on this.

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:28.425
There's bunches of theories,
I was going to make the

01:01:28.425 --> 01:01:30.389
question more elaborate but
let's make it simple.

01:01:30.389 --> 01:01:35.228
What do you think is causing
this very low fertility in Japan

01:01:35.228 --> 01:01:36.518
and Singapore?
 

01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:41.159
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 How long do we have?

01:01:41.159 --> 01:01:45.179
There are a whole range of
theories about this.

01:01:45.179 --> 01:01:49.775
There's a whole theoretical
structure called the second

01:01:49.775 --> 01:01:54.884
demographic transition theory
which explains low fertility on

01:01:54.884 --> 01:01:58.630
grounds of secularization of
societies,

01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:03.786
the collapse of religious
social control over behavior

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:09.039
which relates heavily to
marriage and childbearing,

01:02:09.039 --> 01:02:13.050
of the rising labor force
participation of women,

01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:18.157
and women's labor force
participation being in conflict

01:02:18.157 --> 01:02:23.170
with fertility and childbearing
and child rearing,

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:26.550
and a whole range of other
things that you might just

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:28.630
characterize as modernization.
 

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:33.231
From this point of view
theoretically,

01:02:33.231 --> 01:02:39.697
low fertility is permanent and
inevitable in advanced

01:02:39.697 --> 01:02:41.440
societies.
 

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:46.949
That no society of that kind is
going to ever again approach--

01:02:46.949 --> 01:02:49.210
well they would--I don't know
if they would say this,

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:52.237
but they might,
would not ever exceed

01:02:52.237 --> 01:02:57.114
replacement level and you'll
have high percentages of women

01:02:57.114 --> 01:03:01.320
who will be childless throughout
their lives,

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.922
low marriage rates,
why should anybody bother

01:03:04.922 --> 01:03:09.835
getting married when there's no
problem in cohabiting without

01:03:09.835 --> 01:03:14.460
being married socially,
culturally, and legally if all

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:19.197
the benefits of marriage can be
accrued without needing to get

01:03:19.197 --> 01:03:21.460
married,
why bother.

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:24.360
You actually see that,
especially in the Nordic

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:29.514
countries,
where very high percentages of

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:33.090
the population,
again of women,

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:36.750
we can look at men too but
women are the important

01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:39.289
fertility carriers if you will.
 

01:03:39.289 --> 01:03:42.998
Very high percentages of women
age 30 are never married and

01:03:42.998 --> 01:03:45.940
don't look like they ever will
get married,

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:48.175
very high rates of
cohabitation,

01:03:48.175 --> 01:03:52.141
and in the case of Sweden
fertility has been rising from

01:03:52.141 --> 01:03:55.170
low levels under those
circumstances,

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:57.965
which is posing some
theoretical problems for the

01:03:57.965 --> 01:04:00.880
proponents of the second
demographic transition.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:06.320
We can't explain things like
this.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.693
Life is too complicated,
and collective fertility

01:04:09.693 --> 01:04:13.768
behavior is too complicated to
explain things like this.

01:04:13.768 --> 01:04:17.387
If you look at Japan,
for example,

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:23.744
in Japan you have very low
rates of marriage among women in

01:04:23.744 --> 01:04:25.280
their 20s.
 

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:31.650
It looks like Sweden in terms
of marriage behavior,

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:36.327
but there's a huge difference
in the percentage of births in

01:04:36.327 --> 01:04:40.369
Japan versus Sweden that are
outside of marriage.

01:04:40.369 --> 01:04:44.672
If I remember correctly,
it's like 2% of births in Japan

01:04:44.672 --> 01:04:49.525
are outside of marriage and in
Sweden it's almost 50% of births

01:04:49.525 --> 01:04:52.967
are outside marriage,
so you have the same marriage

01:04:52.967 --> 01:04:55.293
behavior roughly,
but higher fertility

01:04:55.293 --> 01:04:58.449
collectively in Sweden then you
do in Japan.

01:04:58.449 --> 01:05:05.101
Italy, European country,
looks more like Japan in this

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:11.000
respect then it looks like
Sweden or Germany.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.135
Student:  In the media,
this isn't as much of the

01:05:13.135 --> 01:05:14.650
crisis that you talk about it
being,

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:22.585
or at least in America you hear
more about terrorism or the war,

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:23.719
health.
 

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:28.108
Within the government how much
of a big issue is this and at

01:05:28.108 --> 01:05:31.159
what time in history is it
prioritized?

01:05:31.159 --> 01:05:33.284
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 Well the U.S.

01:05:33.284 --> 01:05:36.280
has high fertility by the
standards of its peer countries.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:40.646
It's very close to replacement
level to--last time I looked it

01:05:40.646 --> 01:05:42.150
was 2.0 versus 2.1.
 

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:46.190
It was one 1.1 or so in Italy,
1.3 in Japan,

01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:50.981
so there's less concern here
than there is in--among

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:54.739
political elites in other
countries.

01:05:54.739 --> 01:05:55.867
What the U.S.
 

01:05:55.867 --> 01:05:59.942
does have that most of them
don't have, however,

01:05:59.942 --> 01:06:03.409
is a very large baby boom
generation.

01:06:03.409 --> 01:06:03.894
The U.S.
 

01:06:03.894 --> 01:06:06.931
had a big baby boom,
you've probably discussed this

01:06:06.931 --> 01:06:09.179
in previous lectures,
or you will.

01:06:09.179 --> 01:06:12.574
The U.S., Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand

01:06:12.574 --> 01:06:17.389
really were the four baby boom
countries post World War II.

01:06:17.389 --> 01:06:22.476
In the case of the U.S.,
fertility went from below

01:06:22.476 --> 01:06:27.460
replacement level to 3.7,
doubled essentially.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:34.717
It peaked in 1957 and started
declining sharply in 1965 but

01:06:34.717 --> 01:06:38.753
there was a period--
the so called baby boom

01:06:38.753 --> 01:06:40.764
generation,
if you will,

01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:45.365
1947 birth to 1965,
who are now reaching the

01:06:45.365 --> 01:06:51.574
statutory retirement age and
that bulge is going to rapidly

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:57.996
increase the proportion of the
population in that post 65 age

01:06:57.996 --> 01:07:04.739
group for about 20 years because
it's just aging its way through

01:07:04.739 --> 01:07:07.630
the age structure.
 

01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:09.409
Given that the U.S.
 

01:07:09.409 --> 01:07:13.949
government has proven itself
incapable of getting control

01:07:13.949 --> 01:07:18.813
over health care expenditures
that will be a major crisis for

01:07:18.813 --> 01:07:20.760
the Medicare system.
 

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.929
I can predict that without any
doubt whatever.

01:07:23.929 --> 01:07:26.960
I don't know what's going to
happen, how it will be handled;

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.989
I just know it's going to be a
major crisis.

01:07:28.989 --> 01:07:33.320
Yes, ma'am?
 

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.949
Student:  Could you
speak briefly to--

01:07:34.949 --> 01:07:41.135
could you provide a response to
theorists who would argue that

01:07:41.135 --> 01:07:46.719
widespread moderate decline--
or moderate to severe decline

01:07:46.719 --> 01:07:51.538
in populations is actually,
isn't addressing social and

01:07:51.538 --> 01:07:55.679
environmental concerns and that
kind of thing?

01:07:55.679 --> 01:07:57.789
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 Yes.

01:07:57.789 --> 01:08:02.581
I have a firmly on the fence
moderate position on these

01:08:02.581 --> 01:08:03.380
things.
 

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:08.168
I think both rapid population
growth and rapid population

01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:11.590
decline are problematic for
societies.

01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:15.804
There are too many things tied
to age in these societies like

01:08:15.804 --> 01:08:19.596
public provision of schools
versus healthcare and other

01:08:19.596 --> 01:08:23.039
things that rapid shifts will
cause problems.

01:08:23.039 --> 01:08:27.467
I think I alluded to this;
it's easier for societies to

01:08:27.467 --> 01:08:31.078
adjust to change if it's slower
in general.

01:08:31.078 --> 01:08:35.520
Whether it would be desirable
as some environmentalist's think

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:40.106
for the population of the world
to decline sharply from where it

01:08:40.106 --> 01:08:42.219
is,
six point some billion to

01:08:42.219 --> 01:08:45.890
whatever they think the carrying
capacity of the earth is,

01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:49.721
and that's a highly speculative
calculation of course is another

01:08:49.721 --> 01:08:53.128
matter and I don't think anybody
can really resolve those

01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:53.859
debates.
 

01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:58.136
People feel very strongly in
both directions about those

01:08:58.136 --> 01:08:59.770
sorts of arguments.
 

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:04.282
I would say myself that the
optimal trajectory would be

01:09:04.282 --> 01:09:08.194
fertility rates,
plus or minus 10%,

01:09:08.194 --> 01:09:12.935
15% of replacement level,
not 50% above,

01:09:12.935 --> 01:09:16.792
not 50% below,
not fluctuating a lot because

01:09:16.792 --> 01:09:21.993
if they fluctuate a lot it
causes all kinds of oscillations

01:09:21.993 --> 01:09:26.300
in the age structure over 75 or
100 years,

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:30.939
and those are problematic for
societies but moderation in all

01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:35.269
things is probably a good a
maxim for these kinds of long

01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:38.930
lived,
slow changing but powerful.

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:42.537
They're--demography is like--I
think of demography as being

01:09:42.537 --> 01:09:45.090
like the tectonic plates of the
earth,

01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:49.890
it's moving very slowly by the
standards of elections or

01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:53.481
economic collapses,
or economic booms,

01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:58.407
very slowly but huge force
behind it and huge momentum

01:09:58.407 --> 01:10:02.372
behind it too,
so you don't want to get in the

01:10:02.372 --> 01:10:05.630
way of tectonic plates if you
can avoid it.

01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:08.069
I saw another hand, yes sir?
 

01:10:08.069 --> 01:10:09.109
Student:  From a policy
perspective,

01:10:09.109 --> 01:10:13.699
I guess specifically for the
U.S., are all warm American

01:10:13.699 --> 01:10:18.207
bodies equal or do you take into
consideration economic

01:10:18.207 --> 01:10:21.130
circumstances or anything else?
 

01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:24.050
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 From whose perspective?

01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:26.422
Student:  The
government's or whoever's

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:27.899
working on this currently.
 

01:10:27.899 --> 01:10:29.359
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 Well the government

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:30.090
doesn't have a brain.
 

01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:32.774
I mean the government--
Student:  In your

01:10:32.774 --> 01:10:35.609
perspective, are all warm bodies
equal or-- Dr.

01:10:35.609 --> 01:10:38.735
Michael Teitelbaum:
 I would say it depends on

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:39.630
the economy.
 

01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:42.791
If you had to choose,
this is a personal

01:10:42.791 --> 01:10:45.511
interpretation,
it's not a fact,

01:10:45.511 --> 01:10:50.242
if you had to choose let's say
between a group of very highly

01:10:50.242 --> 01:10:54.500
skilled immigrants or a group of
very low skilled,

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:58.086
let's say illiterate
immigrants, and they were moving

01:10:58.086 --> 01:11:02.572
into society where the--
most of the population was

01:11:02.572 --> 01:11:07.957
illiterate then it wouldn't--
the illiterate immigrant

01:11:07.957 --> 01:11:12.609
population would not be a
serious issue really,

01:11:12.609 --> 01:11:17.251
but if they're moving into a
society in which you have to be

01:11:17.251 --> 01:11:20.948
literate in order to have any
chance of economic

01:11:20.948 --> 01:11:25.337
sustainability and advancement,
it would not be a good idea to

01:11:25.337 --> 01:11:28.507
import large numbers of people
who are not going to make it in

01:11:28.507 --> 01:11:29.340
that society.
 

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:32.863
It's a question of both the
nature and characteristics of

01:11:32.863 --> 01:11:36.323
the immigrants and the nature
and characteristics of the

01:11:36.323 --> 01:11:39.470
economy and society into which
they're moving.

01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:43.171
Governments--if you ask me what
is the position of the U.S.

01:11:43.171 --> 01:11:47.000
or British government on this,
they don't really have one.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.524
It's just the pushing and
shoving of different interest

01:11:50.524 --> 01:11:54.635
groups and wherever the vectors
of pushing and shoving end up is

01:11:54.635 --> 01:11:58.722
what the government policy is,
but it's not necessarily

01:11:58.722 --> 01:12:01.880
thought through in a kind of
logical way.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.270
I think I saw one other hand.
 

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:04.810
We're running out of time.
 

01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:05.908
Prof: Time's up.
 

01:12:05.908 --> 01:12:07.569
Dr. Michael Teitelbaum:
 Okay, good.

01:12:07.569 --> 01:12:10.829

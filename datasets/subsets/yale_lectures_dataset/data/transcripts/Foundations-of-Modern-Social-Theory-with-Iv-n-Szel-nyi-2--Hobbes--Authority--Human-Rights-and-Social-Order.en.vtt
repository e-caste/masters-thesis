00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.060
Prof: Then let's go on
to Thomas Hobbes.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.594
And I do something what
probably not everybody does in a

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:16.732
kind of history of ideas course:
I give you an overview of the

00:00:16.732 --> 00:00:21.060
individual whom you were reading
from,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:30.090
and around some sense of the
historic times they lived in.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.801
Occasionally I get negative
comments in my course

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.580
evaluations for this.
 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.327
People want just to talk about
the text, what they have to

00:00:40.327 --> 00:00:40.910
know.
 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.981
There are some people who like
it, to see well this is how

00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:48.910
Thomas Hobbes looked like,
and who the character was.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.160
So therefore I still will do
this.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.130
I think what I will try to do
is to go very fast through the

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.500
sort of individual's life and
history;

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.420
sort of to have my cake and eat
it, right?

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.858
To give those of you who are
interested in the historical

00:01:07.858 --> 00:01:11.272
context, at least briefly;
and those who are not

00:01:11.272 --> 00:01:14.170
particularly interested,
not to bore them with it.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.784
But you can go back to the
internet and get even more

00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:18.409
detail.
 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.400
Okay, so we'll start this with
Thomas Hobbes.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.159
Whether Foundations of Modern
Social Thought should start with

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.890
Hobbes or not,
that's a question.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.757
In some other courses I've
taught, occasionally I started

00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:41.093
with Thomas Bacon;
I will talk about him very

00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:43.830
briefly later on.
 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.747
But in some ways arguably
Thomas Hobbes is the first who

00:01:48.747 --> 00:01:53.040
laid the foundations of modern
social science.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.897
He was a genuine scientist,
and a formidable one,

00:01:56.897 --> 00:02:01.719
and an extremely controversial
figure, addressing a number of

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.810
very important issues.
 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.378
We are all still very divided,
particularly on human nature.

00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:16.090
Are we by nature good,
or are we by nature evil?

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.658
I think probably half of the
crowd here would go one way;

00:02:21.658 --> 00:02:23.788
the other half would go another
way.

00:02:23.788 --> 00:02:26.688
And I hope to be able to
discuss that in the discussion

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:27.280
sections.
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.574
Anyway there are a number of
very important issues that

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:34.071
Thomas Hobbes framed,
and which have a great deal of

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.508
impact on later social
scientists--

00:02:36.508 --> 00:02:40.180
of course, on Locke,
but also on Adam Smith,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.776
on Nietzsche,
on Freud, on Max Weber and

00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:48.300
others.
 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.196
Okay, so this is Thomas Hobbes,
and let me just very briefly

00:02:52.196 --> 00:02:53.650
talk about his life.
 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.407
I mentioned that--in the
introductory lecture--he was

00:02:57.407 --> 00:02:59.360
born in 1588 in Westport.
 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.560
I also mentioned that his
father was a vicar and he had

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.670
actually a fistfight with a
clergyman in,

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.549
of all places,
in a cemetery which was

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.348
absolutely no-no by that time.
 

00:03:12.348 --> 00:03:18.385
So he had to skip and disappear
and leave young Thomas behind in

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:22.793
the care of an uncle who was
actually a glover,

00:03:22.793 --> 00:03:24.710
produced gloves.
 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.330
And this all happened under the
rule of Queen Elizabeth.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.090
I will talk about this a little
later.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.520
In 1602, he went to Oxford,
to Magdalene Hall,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.568
and then in '08 he graduated,
and he became a tutor of

00:03:44.568 --> 00:03:51.417
William Cavendish II who became
at one point a very important

00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:53.128
politician.
 

00:03:53.128 --> 00:03:57.628
In 1610, he went to France and
Italy.

00:03:57.628 --> 00:04:02.323
It is very important because he
met Galileo and he was

00:04:02.323 --> 00:04:07.460
absolutely turned on by Galileo
and physics of his time.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.467
I already mentioned that Hobbes
cannot be classified in any of

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:12.650
the disciplines.
 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.579
He even cannot be classified as
a social scientist.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.254
He was as much a
mathematician--I gather a pretty

00:04:20.254 --> 00:04:24.925
bad mathematician--but also he
made important contributions to

00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:27.759
sciences, particularly to
optics.

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:33.461
Well, he had a close
association with a person whom

00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:37.910
you may have heard of,
Francis Bacon.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.290
And who was Francis Bacon,
and what is his influence?

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:51.197
Francis Bacon was a philosopher
who rejected the Aristotelian

00:04:51.197 --> 00:04:55.370
logic and system,
which basically was a

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.350
speculative system--
started out from some major

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.024
assumptions and through
deductions developed his

00:05:03.024 --> 00:05:04.899
philosophical system.
 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.678
As I said, occasionally I've
taught this course by starting

00:05:09.678 --> 00:05:13.468
with Francis Bacon because
Bacon, in some ways,

00:05:13.468 --> 00:05:17.259
is the Founding Father of
modern sciences.

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.521
Because he said every
scientific investigation should

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:25.612
start with induction,
from sensual observation,

00:05:25.612 --> 00:05:30.189
and what you cannot observe,
you should not assume it does

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.610
exist.
 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.170
Right?
 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.444
Therefore he advocated a
methodology which was exactly

00:05:35.444 --> 00:05:39.800
the opposite of the Aristotelian
methodology, which was

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.930
deductive.
 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.009
He advocated induction.
 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.802
Now he was very closely
affiliated with William

00:05:47.802 --> 00:05:53.079
Cavendish and had a great deal
of impact on Hobbes initially,

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:57.379
though eventually Hobbes
changed actually his mind.

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:00.975
And he went to Europe and,
among other things,

00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:04.569
he spent time--he knew where to
spend time.

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:10.363
He went to Paris,
and he began to investigate

00:06:10.363 --> 00:06:15.499
natural sciences,
Galileo and Descartes,

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:17.870
in particular.
 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.709
Descartes was a great deal of
importance for Hobbes.

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:29.730
From Galileo he learned an
alternative to Bacon's inductive

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.819
method.
 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:35.286
Galileo offered a methodology
that, by and large,

00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:40.776
social scientists today who
believe in normal social science

00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:42.360
subscribe to.
 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.120
Namely that was the
methodology, what Galileo called

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.480
the resolutive-compositive
method.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.807
It basically meant that you
start with deduction.

00:06:54.807 --> 00:06:55.529
Right?
 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:58.209
You have some initial
hypotheses.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:01.973
Then you move to observation,
sensual observation,

00:07:01.973 --> 00:07:06.199
and from the sensual
observation you make inductions.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:09.689
And you make that and you test
your hypotheses.

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:12.528
That's how it we would say it
today.

00:07:12.528 --> 00:07:18.346
And this is what Bacon learned
from Galileo and adapted his

00:07:18.346 --> 00:07:19.750
methodology.
 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.401
Now this is RenÃ©
Descartes, one of the greatest

00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:30.199
philosophers of his times and of
all times.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:34.391
Descartes ascribed to something
what I call dualism.

00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:35.050
Right?
 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:42.394
Dualism really meant that he
separated the soul and body from

00:07:42.394 --> 00:07:48.728
each other,
and Hobbes rejected this idea

00:07:48.728 --> 00:07:54.940
of dualism because he suggested
that--

00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:00.048
in fact, they were engaged in a
big debate on optics,

00:08:00.048 --> 00:08:01.720
what we do see.
 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.351
And he, Hobbes,
was advocating that there must

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:10.113
be a real object whose movement
we see, what we actually can

00:08:10.113 --> 00:08:10.759
see.
 

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:13.459
So he rejected the dualism.
 

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:15.910
And then he wrote--I mentioned
very briefly--

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.146
his trilogy:
De Corpore, this is

00:08:19.146 --> 00:08:22.293
about the human body,
De Homine,

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:25.800
about man, and finally De
Cive, about society.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.911
I see this as formidable and
something which appeals a great

00:08:29.911 --> 00:08:32.142
deal to social scientists today.
 

00:08:32.142 --> 00:08:32.769
Right?
 

00:08:32.769 --> 00:08:39.039
To try to develop a theory of
society which begins actually

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:42.543
with biology,
with biological processes,

00:08:42.543 --> 00:08:46.708
and build it up gradually from
biology to understanding of the

00:08:46.708 --> 00:08:48.558
social,
of the individual,

00:08:48.558 --> 00:08:51.429
and from the individual to
understand society.

00:08:51.429 --> 00:08:52.830
That's highly controversial.
 

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.509
There are many social
scientists who reject it.

00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:59.697
But today there are many social
scientists who are greatly

00:08:59.697 --> 00:09:03.298
attracted to this,
and we see a re-emergence today

00:09:03.298 --> 00:09:06.090
of sciences and social
scientists.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:13.082
Well Hobbes entered politics as
a Royalist when William

00:09:13.082 --> 00:09:16.840
Cavendish entered politics.
 

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.498
And, in fact,
Hobbes translated,

00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:23.442
I also mentioned,
Thucydides, basically because

00:09:23.442 --> 00:09:28.158
Thucydides expressed some
skepticism about the democracy

00:09:28.158 --> 00:09:29.528
in Athens.
 

00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:38.284
And he was greatly skeptical
about democracy and believed the

00:09:38.284 --> 00:09:43.830
need for a strong central
authority.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.384
Well these were very troubled
times, troubled times and

00:09:48.384 --> 00:09:50.240
religious conflicts.
 

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.504
I'll skip this one because I
know you are all very familiar

00:09:53.504 --> 00:09:54.798
with British history.
 

00:09:54.798 --> 00:09:58.605
But it all started with Henry
VIII who had a very troubled

00:09:58.605 --> 00:10:00.008
marital relationship.
 

00:10:00.008 --> 00:10:00.610
Right?
 

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:04.065
He had three wives;
divorced one,

00:10:04.065 --> 00:10:10.960
executed the second one in
search for a son from one of his

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.028
wives.
 

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:15.373
But in the process of
divorcing, he split from the

00:10:15.373 --> 00:10:18.888
Roman Catholic Church,
and that's when Church of

00:10:18.888 --> 00:10:24.619
England emerged,
and that's how England became

00:10:24.619 --> 00:10:27.980
Protestant of a sort.
 

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.928
Well again, as I said,
I'll skip this one and go on.

00:10:31.928 --> 00:10:36.504
Well this is the eldest
daughter of Henry VIII,

00:10:36.504 --> 00:10:39.389
Mary I, called Bloody Mary.
 

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.889
She inherited the throne.
 

00:10:41.889 --> 00:10:52.596
She was trying to establish
Roman Catholicism but had to

00:10:52.596 --> 00:10:54.350
resign.
 

00:10:54.350 --> 00:11:00.342
There was too much resistance
against it so he had to resign

00:11:00.342 --> 00:11:04.506
and give the throne to his
younger sister,

00:11:04.506 --> 00:11:05.929
Elizabeth.
 

00:11:05.929 --> 00:11:11.048
And this is Queen Elizabeth.
 

00:11:11.048 --> 00:11:16.062
And Queen Elizabeth was at the
time of Puritanism under a great

00:11:16.062 --> 00:11:21.073
deal of pressure of Puritans who
wanted to get rid of Catholics

00:11:21.073 --> 00:11:24.470
altogether from government in
England.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.178
This became a very important
issue later on.

00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:32.558
And New Haven has its Puritan
connections.

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:37.059
Anybody is from Davenport
College?

00:11:37.059 --> 00:11:38.710
Nobody is from Davenport.
 

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:39.940
&gt;
 

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.909
Oh my goodness.
 

00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:44.940
So no real Puritans around here.
 

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.649
Well that's a shame.
 

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:50.110
Anyway, this was Reverend John
Davenport.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:56.707
He was a Puritan who settled in
New Haven, with his followers,

00:11:56.707 --> 00:11:57.788
in 1638.
 

00:11:57.788 --> 00:12:03.379
And already,
of course, in I think 1703,

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:06.149
the Puritans created this
institution,

00:12:06.149 --> 00:12:10.169
and they were basically running
this institution until the late

00:12:10.169 --> 00:12:12.440
nineteenth century-- not
anymore.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:12.976
Okay.
 

00:12:12.976 --> 00:12:19.107
Now there will be a great deal
of conflicts between--yeah,

00:12:19.107 --> 00:12:22.980
Mary was called the Virgin
Queen.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.245
Well whether she was a virgin
or not is unclear,

00:12:27.245 --> 00:12:32.238
but she clearly had a lot of
very close friendships with

00:12:32.238 --> 00:12:34.779
various men in her life.
 

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:38.710
But she never married,
and never gave birth to a

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:39.379
child.
 

00:12:39.379 --> 00:12:44.413
She was actually a very good
queen, a smart,

00:12:44.413 --> 00:12:49.450
good queen by the challenges of
the time.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:55.759
But she was the last one,
and died without a son.

00:12:55.759 --> 00:13:03.980
And then the Crown went over to
the Stuarts, and they were a

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.350
total disaster.
 

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.640
James I was already a disaster,
and Charles I was a real

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.500
disaster.
 

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.403
And they were in a collision
course with parliament,

00:13:15.403 --> 00:13:20.148
and there was a constant war in
England--civil war--culminating

00:13:20.148 --> 00:13:20.990
in '42.
 

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:25.782
And finally Charles I was
executed in '49,

00:13:25.782 --> 00:13:29.990
and Oliver Cromwell came to
power.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:35.349
Now--well here I give you a
picture of the execution of

00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:36.538
Charles I.
 

00:13:36.538 --> 00:13:39.440
If you don't believe it,
you can see it.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:45.743
Well Hobbes got into some
trouble at that time because he

00:13:45.743 --> 00:13:53.024
was too close to the Royalists,
and he had to flee England in

00:13:53.024 --> 00:13:56.211
1640,
ahead of time,

00:13:56.211 --> 00:14:01.250
and he went to live in Paris.
 

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.849
He was very close there to the
Royalist exiles,

00:14:04.849 --> 00:14:07.822
and in '51 he completed his
major book,

00:14:07.822 --> 00:14:12.830
Leviathan--what we will
be talking about in a minute.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:18.158
Well Leviathan became an
extremely controversial book.

00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:22.868
It was very controversial in
his times--became actually a big

00:14:22.868 --> 00:14:25.850
hot topic in the nineteenth
century.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:30.236
And it's a very hot topic in
the last thirty or forty years

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:34.701
because a lot of economists and
political scientists who are

00:14:34.701 --> 00:14:39.087
interested in rational choice
theories discovered in Thomas

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:42.720
Hobbes the first rational choice
theorist.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.860
Actually he's a wonderfully
lucid mind,

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.291
and if you read the text,
and you know enough

00:14:48.291 --> 00:14:50.946
mathematics,
you could do a lot of his

00:14:50.946 --> 00:14:53.870
propositions in mathematical
equations.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.414
What else an economist wants to
do?

00:14:57.414 --> 00:14:58.250
Right?
 

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.317
It must be true if you can put
it into an equation.

00:15:02.317 --> 00:15:02.970
Right?
 

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:08.100
Well that's what certainly
Thomas Hobbes is available to

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.580
do, because of extremely
lucidity of his mind.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:16.092
Well it was therefore a
controversial book--also for the

00:15:16.092 --> 00:15:16.860
Royalists.
 

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.990
Because in '51,
Hobbes--and we will talk about

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:24.024
this in great detail--
was considering that probably

00:15:24.024 --> 00:15:28.756
people should be allowed to
transfer their loyalty to a new

00:15:28.756 --> 00:15:31.203
authority which offers safety.
 

00:15:31.203 --> 00:15:32.019
Right?
 

00:15:32.019 --> 00:15:35.393
And that's what the Royalists
did not want to hear--that

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:38.460
Cromwell actually can become a
legitimate ruler.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:44.934
And that's what,
in a way, the book

00:15:44.934 --> 00:15:50.840
Leviathan foreshadows.
 

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:58.139
So he better have to skip out
of Paris and go back to London.

00:15:58.139 --> 00:16:02.259
This is the First Edition of
Leviathan,

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:02.808
'51.
 

00:16:02.808 --> 00:16:07.428
This is about the idea that
people are by nature evil,

00:16:07.428 --> 00:16:12.802
and we need an all powerful
sovereign to avoid the state of

00:16:12.802 --> 00:16:16.600
war of everyone against everyone
else--

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.179
a powerful proposition.
 

00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:21.957
Again, I would think probably
half of the people in this

00:16:21.957 --> 00:16:24.844
classroom, when really think
hard about it,

00:16:24.844 --> 00:16:29.330
do believe Hobbes's argument;
half of them would be violently

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:30.995
opposed to the argument.
 

00:16:30.995 --> 00:16:31.548
Right?
 

00:16:31.548 --> 00:16:39.575
So it's a very nice topic,
to have heated discussions in

00:16:39.575 --> 00:16:43.370
the discussion sections.
 

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:47.773
Leviathan is a
sea-monster: the state or the

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:48.830
sovereign.
 

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.803
We need to keep order as such.
 

00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:53.600
Okay.
 

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.600
There were a great deal of
controversies around him.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.038
He actually was publishing
rather neutral stuff,

00:17:02.038 --> 00:17:05.330
only attacking
universities--which is always a

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.380
good thing to do,
right?

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.598
But when in 1660 the monarchy
was restored,

00:17:11.598 --> 00:17:15.220
and Charles II,
the son of Charles I became

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.702
king,
Hobbes was invited back to the

00:17:17.702 --> 00:17:19.942
court,
and it looked like he will be

00:17:19.942 --> 00:17:22.068
just fine right now as a
Royalist.

00:17:22.068 --> 00:17:27.150
Not so, because in '66 there
was a fire in London,

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.990
and because of this fire--some
people believed that this fire

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.992
was the revenge of God because
of the sinful New York-- not New

00:17:36.992 --> 00:17:38.041
York--London.
 

00:17:38.041 --> 00:17:38.930
Right?
 

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.118
&gt;
 

00:17:40.118 --> 00:17:45.259
And they were therefore trying
to find the guilty one.

00:17:45.259 --> 00:17:47.108
And who was that?
 

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:50.557
Of course, Thomas Hobbes with
his materialism.

00:17:50.557 --> 00:17:51.170
Right?
 

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.099
No soul.
 

00:17:52.099 --> 00:17:56.519
So how is then eternal life
possible?

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:58.509
This must be an atheist.
 

00:17:58.509 --> 00:18:02.368
His books should be burned,
if not himself.

00:18:02.368 --> 00:18:07.633
So they did not burn his book
and himself, but he certainly

00:18:07.633 --> 00:18:10.808
was out of grace and died in
'79.

00:18:10.808 --> 00:18:14.596
He was greatly admired in
Continental Europe,

00:18:14.596 --> 00:18:18.038
but was very controversial in
England.

00:18:18.038 --> 00:18:21.595
And well, if you don't believe
there was a fire in London,

00:18:21.595 --> 00:18:22.718
here is the proof.
 

00:18:22.718 --> 00:18:23.279
Right?
 

00:18:23.279 --> 00:18:23.650
&gt;
 

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:28.930
There is the great fire of
London, '66, which it looked

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.179
like Los Angeles to me.
 

00:18:31.179 --> 00:18:32.058
Right?
 

00:18:32.058 --> 00:18:32.807
Well okay.
 

00:18:32.807 --> 00:18:35.430
Well it killed 3000 people,
right?

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:40.051
The fire brigade was not as
effective as today is in

00:18:40.051 --> 00:18:41.864
Southern California.
 

00:18:41.864 --> 00:18:42.588
Okay?
 

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:46.798
Now that's about the person and
the times.

00:18:46.798 --> 00:18:51.949
I think extremely for my--as
far as I'm concerned--extremely

00:18:51.949 --> 00:18:57.185
important to understand this,
the work, if you know the times

00:18:57.185 --> 00:18:59.019
when he lived in.
 

00:18:59.019 --> 00:19:10.940
All right, so now let me go on
and talk to Leviathan.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:23.549
&gt;
 

00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:25.910
And here we go.
 

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.338
This is the First Edition of
Leviathan,

00:19:30.338 --> 00:19:34.769
which came out in 1651,
in two big volumes.

00:19:34.769 --> 00:19:39.279
Each one was 500 pages long.
 

00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:41.940
Well this is the structure of
the book.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:49.527
The first part is on man,
and the first few chapters are

00:19:49.527 --> 00:19:52.700
about the mechanisms.
 

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.518
Because of Galileo,
Hobbes was obsessed with the

00:19:56.518 --> 00:19:57.900
idea of motion.
 

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.364
So he described the biological
motions, what moves man:

00:20:02.364 --> 00:20:05.257
senses, imagination,
speech, reason,

00:20:05.257 --> 00:20:07.490
and so on and so forth.
 

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.140
Then chapter six is a fun
chapter.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.685
It is about appetites,
desires, aversions and fears,

00:20:14.685 --> 00:20:17.259
and the theory of voluntary
action.

00:20:17.259 --> 00:20:18.519
I will talk about this.
 

00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:22.934
This is really very insightful,
very important--a very great

00:20:22.934 --> 00:20:27.424
deal of impact on contemporary
times, and I hope you can also

00:20:27.424 --> 00:20:29.670
relate to it individually.
 

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:35.749
And then chapter seven to
eleven is the relationship

00:20:35.749 --> 00:20:38.730
between people as such.
 

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:43.644
And then finally the state of
nature and the two laws of

00:20:43.644 --> 00:20:44.450
nature.
 

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.328
We will have to talk about this
in greater detail.

00:20:48.328 --> 00:20:53.078
So Part II is about
commonwealth.

00:20:53.078 --> 00:20:59.161
It's about really the first
theory of politics--the rights

00:20:59.161 --> 00:21:04.390
and duties of the governments
and the subjects.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.880
There are some very interesting
arguments here;

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.582
that actually the sovereigns
also have duties,

00:21:11.582 --> 00:21:13.640
not only simply rights.
 

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:20.589
And then parts III and IV offer
some theological justification

00:21:20.589 --> 00:21:22.298
what he does.
 

00:21:22.298 --> 00:21:25.917
Part III and IV,
I think very rarely read,

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:29.890
or at least I see very few
citations to it.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.190
So what are the major themes of
the book?

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.210
First, about the theory of
human nature.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:41.688
The second one is the
relationship between nature and

00:21:41.688 --> 00:21:45.058
the theory of social contract.
 

00:21:45.058 --> 00:21:49.323
Hobbes is really the first of
the contractarians,

00:21:49.323 --> 00:21:54.474
who advocates that what brings
society together is a social

00:21:54.474 --> 00:21:55.630
contract.
 

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.816
If you want to understand
society, you have to understand

00:21:58.816 --> 00:22:01.150
that we have contracts with each
other.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.425
And then finally the theory of
the sovereign.

00:22:03.425 --> 00:22:03.838
Right?
 

00:22:03.838 --> 00:22:08.082
The major desire,
the essence of Hobbes's work,

00:22:08.082 --> 00:22:12.047
is to try to find an
identifiable sovereign.

00:22:12.047 --> 00:22:12.970
Right?
 

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.913
He lived in turbulent times
when you did not know who the

00:22:16.913 --> 00:22:17.970
sovereign is.
 

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.569
Is this the king?
 

00:22:19.569 --> 00:22:21.410
Is this the landlord?
 

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.339
Are these the burghers?
 

00:22:23.339 --> 00:22:24.980
Is this the parliament?
 

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.730
Who on earth is the sovereign?
 

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:32.094
He wanted to find one
identifiable sovereign--we can

00:22:32.094 --> 00:22:35.773
all agree, this is the proper
source of law.

00:22:35.773 --> 00:22:36.630
Right?
 

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.756
That's what he was obsessed
with.

00:22:39.756 --> 00:22:40.440
Okay.
 

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.279
So let me then move on and
about human nature.

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:46.338
What are the themes here?
 

00:22:46.338 --> 00:22:53.106
Well one important argument is
that man will deliberate between

00:22:53.106 --> 00:22:58.673
appetites and aversions,
and as a result it will act

00:22:58.673 --> 00:23:00.420
voluntarily.
 

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:06.573
Well that's a fascinating
issue--an issue we cannot get

00:23:06.573 --> 00:23:09.078
rid out of our hair.
 

00:23:09.078 --> 00:23:13.641
Well when I was your age,
we always were vehemently

00:23:13.641 --> 00:23:18.019
debating the question:
Do we have free will or we

00:23:18.019 --> 00:23:19.935
don't have free will?
 

00:23:19.935 --> 00:23:20.940
Right?
 

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.380
Our action is over-determined.
 

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:28.588
This is exactly the question
what Hobbes is talking about and

00:23:28.588 --> 00:23:33.885
develops the idea of voluntary
action which is kind of halfway

00:23:33.885 --> 00:23:38.488
between absolute free will and
complete determination.

00:23:38.488 --> 00:23:39.529
Right?
 

00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:45.529
The idea is that we are driven
by appetite, by desires.

00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:50.464
We will talk in this course
later on about Sigmund Freud who

00:23:50.464 --> 00:23:52.557
was talking about drives.
 

00:23:52.557 --> 00:23:53.308
Right?
 

00:23:53.308 --> 00:23:56.690
There are drives which makes us
move.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:02.468
These are what Hobbes called
appetite, a few centuries before

00:24:02.468 --> 00:24:04.009
Sigmund Freud.
 

00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:07.970
But then he said we also have
aversions, we have fears.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:12.061
There are things what we want,
but we have fears that we won't

00:24:12.061 --> 00:24:16.798
be able to achieve what we want,
and therefore we have to

00:24:16.798 --> 00:24:21.973
somehow negotiate out between
our desires, appetites,

00:24:21.973 --> 00:24:24.960
and our fears or aversions.
 

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.500
And what comes out is voluntary
action.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.808
We have a choice. Right?
 

00:24:30.808 --> 00:24:34.788
We have to measure up what the
price of our action will be,

00:24:34.788 --> 00:24:39.092
and then we decide whether it
is worth to pay this price or it

00:24:39.092 --> 00:24:41.420
is not worth to pay this price.
 

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.601
So I see somebody whom I desire
a great deal,

00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:48.000
I thought it would be a great
partner for me.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.575
But in order to approach that
person and to say,

00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:54.009
"Can I have a date?"
 

00:24:54.009 --> 00:24:57.929
it has risks because it may
say, "Go to hell."

00:24:57.929 --> 00:24:58.500
Right?
 

00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.500
&gt;
 

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.762
And I don't want to be
rejected.

00:25:00.762 --> 00:25:01.088
Right?
 

00:25:01.088 --> 00:25:04.288
I have fears that I will be
rejected.

00:25:04.288 --> 00:25:06.868
So I will be measuring up,
right?

00:25:06.868 --> 00:25:10.670
And some of you,
if you are in such a situation,

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.930
if you sense that the answer
will be no,

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.515
you don't place a phone call,
and you will never get that

00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:17.962
person.
 

00:25:17.962 --> 00:25:18.539
Right?
 

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:24.118
The fear overrules the appetite.
 

00:25:24.118 --> 00:25:26.156
Or others will say,
"Heck."

00:25:26.156 --> 00:25:26.778
You know?
 

00:25:26.778 --> 00:25:29.875
"If they say no,
then I will try a second time,

00:25:29.875 --> 00:25:33.034
I will try a third time,
and if it's no a third time,

00:25:33.034 --> 00:25:34.491
then I'll give up."
 

00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:35.160
Right?
 

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.832
Okay, so this is voluntary
action.

00:25:37.832 --> 00:25:38.480
Right?
 

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.618
This is freedom. Right?
 

00:25:40.618 --> 00:25:44.644
You are free to decide whether
you want to try it again.

00:25:44.644 --> 00:25:45.230
Right?
 

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:49.660
Whether you want to achieve
your appetites.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.680
And then the second point is we
will seek power.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.670
The essence of human nature is
that we are striving for power.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.740
Again an issue,
a very good issue to discuss at

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.410
the discussion section.
 

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:07.194
Again, I think half of the
class will probably agree with

00:26:07.194 --> 00:26:11.318
Hobbes, that people are actually
trying to dominate others.

00:26:11.318 --> 00:26:14.328
Others will say we are much
more benevolent.

00:26:14.328 --> 00:26:18.210
We are actually nice people,
we don't want to dominate.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.358
Well we will see his argument
for it.

00:26:21.358 --> 00:26:25.017
Well he said actually--and the
last point is,

00:26:25.017 --> 00:26:29.257
you know--if we want to
survive, we will need an all

00:26:29.257 --> 00:26:31.170
powerful sovereign.
 

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.500
So voluntary action.
 

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.348
He actually said there are two
kinds of motions.

00:26:37.348 --> 00:26:40.291
One motion is what he calls
vital motions,

00:26:40.291 --> 00:26:43.163
and these are stuff like,
you know, food,

00:26:43.163 --> 00:26:46.250
that we want to have food or
something.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.665
And there is what he
calls--well it sounds strange

00:26:49.665 --> 00:26:51.338
today--animal motions.
 

00:26:51.338 --> 00:26:56.273
But this is what I think is
better called voluntary motions

00:26:56.273 --> 00:27:01.720
which actually has something to
do with appetites or desires,

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.308
or aversions,
and how to deal with this.

00:27:05.308 --> 00:27:08.710
So let me just speak about
appetites and aversions.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:12.147
Again, I don't want to read the
text.

00:27:12.147 --> 00:27:15.970
I will put it on the internet
for you.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:19.346
It just describes what I have
said, that we all have

00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:22.259
appetites, we have desires,
we have needs.

00:27:22.259 --> 00:27:26.645
And in order to satisfy our
needs, it always has costs,

00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:31.682
and therefore we have to figure
out whether it's worth the cost

00:27:31.682 --> 00:27:33.955
for us to satisfy that need.
 

00:27:33.955 --> 00:27:34.848
Right?
 

00:27:34.848 --> 00:27:37.730
And therefore we have a certain
degree of freedom.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:42.768
We can't do whatever we want to
do, because we may not have the

00:27:42.768 --> 00:27:44.798
resources to afford it.
 

00:27:44.798 --> 00:27:49.400
Or we want to have many things,
and then we will have to

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.420
prioritize what we want to have
more and spend more on it.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:58.000
As you can hear,
Hobbes is very close to what

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.685
later on becomes the
utilitarians.

00:28:00.685 --> 00:28:01.500
Right?
 

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:06.676
Very close to what Adam Smith
will argue in his economic

00:28:06.676 --> 00:28:11.760
theory, or what John Stuart
Mills will represent in his

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.548
utilitarianism.
 

00:28:13.548 --> 00:28:17.134
Or, for that sake,
what most economists today

00:28:17.134 --> 00:28:19.317
believe,
who call themselves

00:28:19.317 --> 00:28:22.911
neoclassical economists,
or who identify themselves as

00:28:22.911 --> 00:28:26.028
"rat"
choice, or rational choice;

00:28:26.028 --> 00:28:28.657
economists or political
scientists or sociologists,

00:28:28.657 --> 00:28:32.073
for that sake;
there are some sociologists who

00:28:32.073 --> 00:28:34.980
also subscribe to rational
choice.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.810
All right, this is also very
lovely: deliberation and the

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:39.288
will.
 

00:28:39.288 --> 00:28:42.020
And he said,
well when we have desires and

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.009
we have aversions,
that's when we're actually

00:28:45.009 --> 00:28:49.852
beginning to figure out--
we deliberate what on earth is

00:28:49.852 --> 00:28:51.368
worse for us.
 

00:28:51.368 --> 00:28:56.230
And the end of this
deliberation we have a will.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.888
We decide I go for it,
I want that date.

00:28:59.888 --> 00:29:00.640
Right?
 

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.102
Or we decide I don't want it,
because the costs are too high.

00:29:06.102 --> 00:29:06.740
Okay?
 

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.282
And this is what we call the
will.

00:29:09.282 --> 00:29:09.900
Right?
 

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.720
Your will will be that you
decide I go for it,

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.900
or you decide,
no, that's not worth for me,

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.859
it would be silly--I make a
clawn out of me,

00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:22.130
I just don't do it. Right?
 

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:23.808
That's the will.
 

00:29:23.808 --> 00:29:25.700
Well about power.
 

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.298
The power is unending. Right?
 

00:29:29.298 --> 00:29:33.717
He said there is a general
inclination for us to seek

00:29:33.717 --> 00:29:37.029
power, our influence on other
people.

00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:40.338
And he said there is nothing
evil about it.

00:29:40.338 --> 00:29:45.507
It is necessary because if we
want to survive we will have to

00:29:45.507 --> 00:29:48.779
try to exercise influence on
others.

00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:51.308
We have to seek power as such.
 

00:29:51.308 --> 00:29:56.707
An extremely important idea,
which foreshadows especially

00:29:56.707 --> 00:30:02.490
Nietzsche and Max Weber who
comes up later in this course.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:06.258
Well then here comes a very
interesting argument about

00:30:06.258 --> 00:30:08.890
equality; a very exciting
argument.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:14.086
He is one of the very first
philosophers who claims that we

00:30:14.086 --> 00:30:15.970
are all born equal.
 

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:21.768
Now for you this is of course
obvious, but it was not obvious

00:30:21.768 --> 00:30:26.406
in 1651 that people--nobles and
serfs, slaves and

00:30:26.406 --> 00:30:30.078
slaveholders--were all born
equal.

00:30:30.078 --> 00:30:33.396
And he said,
in fact--also extremely

00:30:33.396 --> 00:30:37.433
important--
that we are equal actually in

00:30:37.433 --> 00:30:42.948
strengths because even the
weakest person has the capacity

00:30:42.948 --> 00:30:45.461
to kill the strongest one.
 

00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:46.430
Right?
 

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:50.526
Even David can kill Goliath.
 

00:30:50.526 --> 00:30:51.548
Right?
 

00:30:51.548 --> 00:30:54.960
But he said the same goes
intellectually;

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.796
in fact, intellectually we are
even more equal than by physical

00:30:59.796 --> 00:31:00.420
power.
 

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.348
So that sounds wonderful,
and you probably all agree with

00:31:04.348 --> 00:31:04.700
it.
 

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.068
But then he makes a very
controversial point,

00:31:07.068 --> 00:31:10.387
and probably there are some
people in this room who agree

00:31:10.387 --> 00:31:12.534
with him,
but others probably will

00:31:12.534 --> 00:31:13.608
disagree with it.
 

00:31:13.608 --> 00:31:19.736
Namely, he said what comes from
this equality is this unending

00:31:19.736 --> 00:31:23.432
fight;
that because we desire the same

00:31:23.432 --> 00:31:25.593
thing--
and he operates with the

00:31:25.593 --> 00:31:28.673
scarcity assumption,
that what is desirable is

00:31:28.673 --> 00:31:31.886
actually scarce-- that we'll
fight each other.

00:31:31.886 --> 00:31:32.528
Right?
 

00:31:32.528 --> 00:31:36.859
And we can't fight each other
because we are equal--because we

00:31:36.859 --> 00:31:40.410
can kill each other,
we can outsmart each other.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:42.992
This is a very unusual
argument.

00:31:42.992 --> 00:31:43.660
Right?
 

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:47.328
He is a very ironic guy. Right?
 

00:31:47.328 --> 00:31:51.253
He always says things that you
may not want to hear.

00:31:51.253 --> 00:31:51.868
Right?
 

00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:55.654
And this is something who
believes in equality do not want

00:31:55.654 --> 00:31:57.378
to hear;
that, in fact,

00:31:57.378 --> 00:32:01.996
equality can be interpreted as
the reason for social conflict,

00:32:01.996 --> 00:32:05.630
rather than the solution for
social conflict.

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.288
That is his argument.
 

00:32:07.288 --> 00:32:10.539
Very interesting,
very unusual--right?--and

00:32:10.539 --> 00:32:15.028
again, probably the closest to
Nietzsche as we will see.

00:32:15.028 --> 00:32:18.920
Well then we have--this is,
I won't read it;

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.291
save it, this is the page you
want to print,

00:32:22.291 --> 00:32:26.840
because for the rest of your
life, if you ever want to cite

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.430
Hobbes, this is the citation.
 

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:36.375
Namely that we will therefore
be in a war of everyone against

00:32:36.375 --> 00:32:40.890
everyone else,
for the above reasons.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:44.328
Now about the question of
social contract.

00:32:44.328 --> 00:32:47.490
Well he operates with this idea
of state of Nature.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.529
And we will talk a lot about
this.

00:32:49.529 --> 00:32:53.740
Because among most of the
social theories--Founding

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.531
Fathers of social
theories--there is a debate,

00:32:57.531 --> 00:33:01.068
what is the original nature of
humans?

00:33:01.068 --> 00:33:04.826
And it's controversial whether
this is a useful concept at all,

00:33:04.826 --> 00:33:06.160
the state of nature.
 

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.480
But he did believe in this.
 

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:15.818
Well there are really two basic
laws of nature.

00:33:15.818 --> 00:33:21.696
One law of nature is that you
are forbidden what is harmful to

00:33:21.696 --> 00:33:22.082
you.
 

00:33:22.082 --> 00:33:22.950
Right?
 

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:26.000
You have to pursue
self-interest.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.596
Here again you see the rational
choice theory speaking.

00:33:29.596 --> 00:33:30.130
Right?
 

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:34.219
People are self-interested,
and this is the law of nature

00:33:34.219 --> 00:33:36.628
that we should be
self-interested.

00:33:36.628 --> 00:33:37.358
Right?
 

00:33:37.358 --> 00:33:40.828
We have to do everything in
order to preserve our life.

00:33:40.828 --> 00:33:44.902
But there is a second law of
nature, he argues,

00:33:44.902 --> 00:33:50.529
and this requires that we--
what you would not do--yeah,

00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:56.865
not to do others what you would
not want them to do to you.

00:33:56.865 --> 00:33:57.848
Right?
 

00:33:57.848 --> 00:34:00.609
This is--again,
you may want to save this

00:34:00.609 --> 00:34:01.368
citation.
 

00:34:01.368 --> 00:34:05.034
A very important
citation--foreshadows major

00:34:05.034 --> 00:34:08.306
theories of ethics,
which come many,

00:34:08.306 --> 00:34:12.409
many years or decades or
centuries after him,

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:22.605
particularly Emanuel Kant and
his categorical imperative.

00:34:22.605 --> 00:34:23.880
Okay.
 

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.179
Well in the state of nature if
there are no restraints,

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.329
there is no civilization.
 

00:34:30.329 --> 00:34:34.617
That's a very interesting idea,
that pressure limiting the

00:34:34.617 --> 00:34:36.949
state of nature is necessary.
 

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:41.481
This is again foreshadows
absolutely Sigmund Freud and his

00:34:41.481 --> 00:34:45.813
theory of civilization;
that civilization comes out of

00:34:45.813 --> 00:34:49.878
the repression of drives,
rather than satisfaction of

00:34:49.878 --> 00:34:50.659
drives.
 

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:55.490
If whatever you always need is
immediately satisfied,

00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:58.000
there is no civilization.
 

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.208
Civilization comes from
sufferings, from suppressed

00:35:02.208 --> 00:35:03.050
desires.
 

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:07.603
That's when you go back and you
create great pieces of art or

00:35:07.603 --> 00:35:12.157
you become a great scientist
because you suppress your sexual

00:35:12.157 --> 00:35:13.525
and other desires.
 

00:35:13.525 --> 00:35:14.360
Right?
 

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:20.273
It's always from suffering the
great products of humankind are

00:35:20.273 --> 00:35:21.436
coming from.
 

00:35:21.436 --> 00:35:22.309
Right?
 

00:35:22.309 --> 00:35:25.474
That's what he's saying,
and that's of course what

00:35:25.474 --> 00:35:27.090
Sigmund Freud will say.
 

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:29.530
Okay, there are there are the
two laws of nature.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.846
And again, I don't want to
elaborate on it;

00:35:31.846 --> 00:35:33.170
this is quite obvious.
 

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:36.844
He said there is the elementary
law of nature,

00:35:36.844 --> 00:35:40.601
the first right,
that we have to do whatever is

00:35:40.601 --> 00:35:43.380
necessary for self-protection.
 

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:48.742
And the other one is that we
actually should consider others,

00:35:48.742 --> 00:35:50.710
what others will do.
 

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:53.369
Well, and then the contract.
 

00:35:53.369 --> 00:36:01.219
Well what follows from the
Second Law of Nature is that we

00:36:01.219 --> 00:36:07.969
put our rights aside and
transfer it to others.

00:36:07.969 --> 00:36:14.965
Well this transfer of rights,
there is some reciprocity in

00:36:14.965 --> 00:36:15.579
it.
 

00:36:15.579 --> 00:36:19.373
We give up some rights,
and we get something in

00:36:19.373 --> 00:36:22.920
exchange--protection or safety
or something,

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.909
as such.
 

00:36:23.909 --> 00:36:28.137
And when we transfer this right
to somebody else,

00:36:28.137 --> 00:36:33.159
this is what is called the
covenant or social contract.

00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:37.030
As far as I can tell,
this is the first formulation

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.739
of the theory of social
contract.

00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:46.349
It's not quite the theory of
social contract that we will

00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:50.480
read from Locke or from
Rousseau.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:56.420
Because he said two,
again, controversial comments.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:01.289
One, that, in fact,
a contract we entered by fear

00:37:01.289 --> 00:37:03.420
is also obligatory.
 

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:08.458
Just because we were forced
into a contract out of fear does

00:37:08.458 --> 00:37:13.753
not mean that we can walk out of
this contract whenever we want

00:37:13.753 --> 00:37:14.010
to.
 

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:14.949
Right?
 

00:37:14.949 --> 00:37:17.268
So it's very much status quo.
 

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:18.934
He's a conservative guy.
 

00:37:18.934 --> 00:37:21.918
I think it has to be
understand, he's deeply

00:37:21.918 --> 00:37:23.030
conservative.
 

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:28.103
And then he also said that in
fact a former contract makes

00:37:28.103 --> 00:37:30.239
void a later contract.
 

00:37:30.239 --> 00:37:33.481
So there is no divorce,
to put it this way.

00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:34.099
Right?
 

00:37:34.099 --> 00:37:38.248
Once you swear,
you know, that well I'll stay

00:37:38.248 --> 00:37:41.925
with you until we live,
that's about it.

00:37:41.925 --> 00:37:42.869
Right?
 

00:37:42.869 --> 00:37:47.630
There is no new contract which
voids it.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:52.650
Now very briefly about the
power of the sovereign.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:56.170
Its power is to produce safety
to the people.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:56.809
Right?
 

00:37:56.809 --> 00:37:58.869
He lives in unsafe times.
 

00:37:58.869 --> 00:38:01.940
So he wants safer-- safety.
 

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:06.461
But obedience is only due to
the extent the sovereign can

00:38:06.461 --> 00:38:10.784
deliver this safety,
and if it cannot--why Charles I

00:38:10.784 --> 00:38:16.286
couldn't--
well you could withdraw your

00:38:16.286 --> 00:38:21.739
obedience, your loyalty from it.
 

00:38:21.739 --> 00:38:29.409
Okay, now what is important in
his time, to find out who the

00:38:29.409 --> 00:38:31.360
sovereign is.
 

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.797
And the sovereign actually can
be--and I just point out two

00:38:36.797 --> 00:38:41.860
words from this citation-- can
be transferred on one

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.335
man,
the king, or upon one

00:38:45.335 --> 00:38:47.309
assembly of man.
 

00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:49.260
That's, I think,
extremely important.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:54.063
Though he was very strongly in
favor of absolutism,

00:38:54.063 --> 00:38:58.961
he did consider that the
sovereign can be a properly

00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:01.460
assembled body of man.
 

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:05.768
But how they will be properly
assembled, he doesn't have the

00:39:05.768 --> 00:39:09.056
faintest idea,
or doesn't have the guts to say

00:39:09.056 --> 00:39:09.275
it.
 

00:39:09.275 --> 00:39:10.079
Right?
 

00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:12.800
It will become much more clear
in Locke,

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.690
and particularly in Rousseau,
where the sovereign is,

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:20.512
and it becomes,
of course, crystal clear in the

00:39:20.512 --> 00:39:23.449
American Constitution,
which starts,

00:39:23.449 --> 00:39:25.170
"We the people."
 

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:25.699
Right?
 

00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:27.820
That's where the sovereign is.
 

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.231
In Hobbes's time,
it was not quite we the

00:39:31.231 --> 00:39:36.152
people, but he did consider
that it may not be the royalty,

00:39:36.152 --> 00:39:36.867
the king.
 

00:39:36.867 --> 00:39:37.739
Right?
 

00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:42.159
Now the sovereign does have
duties.

00:39:42.159 --> 00:39:51.219
The office of the sovereign has
to procure safety of the people.

00:39:51.219 --> 00:39:56.277
And he said--he adds to this;
extremely important--that it is

00:39:56.277 --> 00:39:58.300
not bare preservation.
 

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:03.210
It has to give more than just
survival, as such.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.818
And therefore you can expect
for the sovereign to deliver

00:40:06.818 --> 00:40:10.684
this, and if the sovereign does
not deliver, you can withdraw

00:40:10.684 --> 00:40:11.780
your loyalty.
 

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.300
So even though he is a theorist
of Absolutism,

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:20.784
he does see the need and
possibility that you withdraw

00:40:20.784 --> 00:40:25.099
your loyalty and you transfer it
to a good king,

00:40:25.099 --> 00:40:30.820
to a good sovereign, as such.
 

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.239
Well the question is also what
are the good laws?

00:40:34.239 --> 00:40:38.253
People say good laws are the
laws which are good for the

00:40:38.253 --> 00:40:39.130
sovereign.
 

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:42.766
And he said--and this is
extremely important,

00:40:42.766 --> 00:40:47.807
I highlighted it--it is not so,
not true, that good laws serve

00:40:47.807 --> 00:40:49.710
only the sovereign.
 

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:54.449
The good laws should serve the
people.

00:40:54.449 --> 00:40:57.190
Well, and this is the end of it.
 

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:01.219
What are his contributions and
what are his shortcomings?

00:41:01.219 --> 00:41:05.460
Well his emphasis is on peace
and order.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.329
Right?
 

00:41:06.329 --> 00:41:11.496
But what he does not consider,
that the sovereign might abuse

00:41:11.496 --> 00:41:12.530
his power.
 

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:16.079
And this will be the big
criticism of Hobbes by later

00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:18.213
theorists;
particularly by Locke.

00:41:18.213 --> 00:41:20.121
We will set it already
Wednesday.

00:41:20.121 --> 00:41:20.659
Right?
 

00:41:20.659 --> 00:41:26.492
Locke is primary considered by
the possibility that the

00:41:26.492 --> 00:41:29.949
sovereign may abuse its power.
 

00:41:29.949 --> 00:41:34.268
Well, and then he actually does
not develop, as a result,

00:41:34.268 --> 00:41:37.739
any theory how power can be
held in checks.

00:41:37.739 --> 00:41:40.690
There is no theory of checks
and balances.

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:45.143
There is one in Hobbes,
and even one more developed in

00:41:45.143 --> 00:41:46.320
Montesquieu.
 

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.264
And the American Constitution
does not come from Hobbes,

00:41:50.264 --> 00:41:53.492
but it comes from Locke,
and particularly from

00:41:53.492 --> 00:41:54.639
Montesquieu.
 

00:41:54.639 --> 00:41:59.597
Montesquieu is the one which
defined that checks and balances

00:41:59.597 --> 00:42:03.070
which entered the American
Constitution.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:07.708
Well he was an apologetical
theorist of an enlightened

00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:11.210
absolutism--not any absolutism,
right?

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:17.699
He was against real monsters,
as I already demonstrated it.

00:42:17.699 --> 00:42:20.911
As a result,
he was not acceptable to the

00:42:20.911 --> 00:42:25.969
monarchs because he put too much
limitations on their powers;

00:42:25.969 --> 00:42:30.353
but he was not acceptable to
the emergent bourgeois class

00:42:30.353 --> 00:42:34.579
because it attributed too much
power to the monarch.

00:42:34.579 --> 00:42:38.302
And therefore nobody really
liked Hobbes,

00:42:38.302 --> 00:42:42.489
but nobody liked--and you may
not like him.

00:42:42.489 --> 00:42:46.849
What is impossible is to ignore
him;

00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:49.340
you have to listen to him.
 

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:55.340
Well see you Wednesday and
Thursday in discussion sections.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:43:00.000

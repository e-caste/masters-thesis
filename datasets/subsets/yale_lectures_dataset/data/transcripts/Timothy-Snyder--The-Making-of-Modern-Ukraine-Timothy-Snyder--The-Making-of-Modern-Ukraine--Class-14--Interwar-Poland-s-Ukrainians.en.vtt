00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
(static crackling)
(thoughtful music)

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.570
- Okay, greetings. Happy Thursday.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.160
I would take us outside

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.520
except for the whole recording business,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.370
which we can't take outside,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.840
which makes me a little sad
because it's a beautiful day.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.640
This has been one of
those New England falls

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.920
that they promise you with the nice days

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.230
and, like, the leaves
falling from the trees.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.070
I was driving last night back from Boston,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.260
and it was very dark and
I was on country roads

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.070
and there was nobody else out
there and it was very foggy,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.380
and the leaves were kind of swirling down,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.330
and I kept thinking, like,
there's going to be a guy

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.100
with no head in my rear view mirror,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.740
like, riding me down on his black horse.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.113
That really did make
me think of that story.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.600
So thank you for being inside.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.250
Thank you for coming to this lecture.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.160
What we're going to try to do today is get

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.562
into interwar Poland and, in particular,

00:01:05.562 --> 00:01:09.510
interwar Poland's Ukrainian question.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.610
I'm going to start by setting the scene,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.010
and then we'll spend
the rest of the lecture

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.520
trying to figure out how
that scene makes sense.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.560
So here's the scene to imagine.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.300
It's December of 1933.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.410
A Polish border guard is at work,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.230
but he's not at work
protecting the border.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.800
He's at work carrying
someone, leading someone

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.440
towards the border to cross the border

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.860
into the Soviet Union,
into Soviet Ukraine,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.800
not far from the Volhynian town of Dubno,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.163
very close to border post 1,381.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.440
The two men are speaking
to each other in Russian.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.570
The border guard is the more assured,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.850
the border crosser the less assured.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.410
As they reach the border,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.710
the border guard gives
the border crosser a gun.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.270
The crosser nervously puts
the safety on and off.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.510
The border guard gives the
border crosser a white coat

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.300
so he can't be seen in the snow.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.370
He gives him a compass and reminds him

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.170
that in Polish compasses,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.320
the black is the north end of the needle.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.260
And with these supplies and
with a few words of reassurance,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.150
the border crosser makes his way

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.673
across the border into the Soviet Union.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.290
How does it come to that?

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.310
I mean, isn't it interesting

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.680
that Poland is sending people illegally

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.470
into the Soviet Union in 1933?

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.750
What kind of Poland is doing that?

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.970
What are Poland's aims?

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.420
So let's start with what kind of Poland,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.943
because now that we're
into the 1920s and 1930s,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.120
the territorial distribution
of Ukraine has changed again,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.010
as we said at the end of the last lecture.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.520
Most of what's now Ukraine
is inside the Soviet Union

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.220
as a republic which is named Ukraine.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.500
Much of what is now Ukraine, in particular

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.352
districts called Galicia
or Volhynia, Galicja,

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:10.110
Wolyn, Halychyna, Volyn,
are inside Poland.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.330
So there's a new east-west division.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.190
There are five or six million people

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.520
who speak Ukrainian who
are now inside Poland,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.250
roughly 15% of the population of Poland,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.950
which is a pretty sizable
national minority.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.440
For comparison, that's two or
three percentage points more

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.620
than there are African
Americans in the United States.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.490
So we have to contend now with Poland.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.840
If we don't understand Poland,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.840
we can't understand the
position of these Ukrainians,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.470
but we also can't understand
how the Poles might be trying

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.960
to answer the Ukrainian question.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.340
So you'll all remember Poland
had been a great power.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.173
There was this thing

00:03:48.173 --> 00:03:49.890
called the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.030
that existed from 1569 to 1795.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.070
You'll remember from just
a couple lectures ago

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.490
that the collapse of the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.446
in the late 18th century
is the central part

00:04:02.446 --> 00:04:06.570
of the advance of the
Russian Empire into Europe.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.970
The late 18th century is
the time of the collapse

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.320
of the Crimean Khanate.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.440
It's the time of the collapse
of the Ukrainian Cossack state,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.120
and it's also the time of the collapse

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.800
of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.730
So the late 18th century is the moment

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.100
when Russia becomes a European power,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.020
which is symbolized with a shift

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.420
of the capital from
Moscow to St. Petersburg,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.550
actually the creation of St. Petersburg,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.550
which Pushkin famously calls a window,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.710
a window into Europe.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.620
So the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth is gone,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.760
but it has left certain
very important legacies

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.290
for Ukrainians.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.020
I mean, I've stressed this
point over and over again,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.880
but it's very important to remember

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.350
that most of Ukraine was
connected to Lithuania or Poland

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.910
much longer than it was connected

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.130
with the Russian Empire
or the Soviet Union.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.020
So just these hundreds of years

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.780
that we've spent studying
that, that's a sort of legacy.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.440
But I'll mention three
particular political legacies.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.740
One would be the existence
of the Cossacks themselves.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.450
So it's not as though the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.090
created the Cossacks,
but the Cossacks existed

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.880
in a particular form
inside and at the edge

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.310
of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.510
A second is the general idea of a republic

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.370
as a state form, right?

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.510
So when Ukrainians try
to found states in 1918,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.090
they take the form of republics.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.680
They take the name of republics.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.320
That is in some way natural
because it's the European norm,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.270
but it's also natural because a republic

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.780
is also an important part
of Ukrainian history.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.720
A third legacy is the rule of law.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.570
So the rule of law in the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.860
didn't apply to everybody.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.780
It applied to the nobility.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.220
The Cossacks were well aware of this,

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.830
which is why they wanted to
be treated like the nobility,

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.900
and much of the conflict
between the Cossacks

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.390
and the Polish state had
to do with the rights

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.600
of the Cossacks, that Cossacks
should have some kind

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.980
of rights vis-a-vis the state.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.530
They were dissatisfied
with their legal position,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.360
but they were aware that it was a state

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.590
which had the rule of law,

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.820
and that is also a kind of legacy.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.320
Okay, so in the case of Ukraine,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.850
I've tried to make the argument,

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.410
a little bit counterintuitive,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.750
that it was a good thing
to be divided, right?

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.750
So it always seems painful

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.030
and it lends itself to images of martyrdom

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.400
when, you know, the
national body is divided

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.870
into multiple pieces and so on.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.873
But if you're going to
be occupied by empires,

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.290
I'm not recommending this,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.390
but if you're going to
be occupied by empires,

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.890
there are certain political advantages

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.290
to being occupied by more
than one empire, right?

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.150
So just logically speaking,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.310
one of them is going to be
less repressive than the other.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.440
I mean, that may be a slightly
depressing way to look at it,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.690
but one of them will be less
suppressive than the other,

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.760
and it's always possible
that the two of them will

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.800
in some way compete over you, right?

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.960
Or they'll try to use
you against the other,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.390
which might turn out to be
to your long-term advantage.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.400
I tried to explain the dynamics of this

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.530
with the Habsburgs and the Russian Empire.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.257
With Poland, there's a similar situation,

00:07:07.257 --> 00:07:09.210
but the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth is divided

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.770
between three empires.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.360
It's divided between Prussia,
which becomes United Germany,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.180
and this is a big story which
is sort of on the periphery

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.200
of what we've been talking about,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.670
but it keeps becoming more central.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.800
Like, you can ignore
the Germans for a while,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.060
but eventually, they make their way

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.660
to the center of your attention.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.060
I mean, that's kind of a general truth,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.460
but it's true in this class.

00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:34.350
So we started with this little state,

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.760
Royal Prussia, on the Baltic,

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.460
which the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth kind of tolerates.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.080
After the ruin, after the weakening

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.460
of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.300
this little state Prussia
decides that it's a kingdom.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.580
It decides that its
ruling family are kings.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.330
That state, Prussia,
will become much larger

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.180
in the 18th century,
and in the 19th century,

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.230
that state Prussia, in 1870,
1871, will unite Germany,

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.030
will create a unified German state.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.080
So the partitioning power of
Poland is actually not Germany,

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.140
which doesn't exist yet, but Prussia.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.380
But when Prussia unites Germany in 1871,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.020
the Poles are then the most
important national minority

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.930
inside that new German state,

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.330
and they're subject to
various repressive policies,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.910
which they respond to in a
way which we would think of

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.310
as involving organized civil society.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.260
So the Germans try to buy up all the land.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.910
The Poles organize their own groups

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.760
to collect money and to preserve the land.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.620
The Germans try to build libraries.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.240
The Poles build libraries.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.070
The Germans Germanize the schools.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.770
The Poles set up their
own reading societies.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.000
The Poles publish their books.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.090
So there's a certain style of
resistance in German Poland.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.190
We've talked a bit about the Habsburgs.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.490
The Habsburgs are the second
partitioning power of Poland.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.280
In the Habsburg monarchy,
other conditions prevail,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.230
and the Polish gentry,
the Polish nobility,

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:56.580
are able to gain experience as
administrators, bureaucrats.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.830
Some of them are elected to parliament.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.570
They gain experience of freedom of speech.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.720
They gain experience of
publishing as they wish.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.610
All of that experience will also matter

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.980
for a reunited Poland later on.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.410
Most of what had been Poland becomes part

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.000
of the Russian Empire, and there,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.510
the political tradition is
much more revolutionary,

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.040
as one would expect.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.900
The kinds of things that were possible

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.790
in the Habsburg monarchy
or even in Prussia

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.710
are not possible in the Russian Empire.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.510
The only kinds of politics
that are really possible

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.210
in the Russian Empire are underground,

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.550
very well organized, conspiratorial,

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.200
which leads to certain habits of mind

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.970
and certain habits of practice.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.100
So you have three different traditions,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.380
all of which have advantages
and disadvantages,

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.340
coming together in Poland
when it is created in 1918.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.380
One more advantage I
should really mention.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.220
So as I'm sure many of you
have been thinking about,

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.530
an interesting feature
of the war in Ukraine now

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.860
is that the people on the
Ukrainian side know the language

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.320
of the aggressing state, right?

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.630
So basically all the Poles

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.490
I'm going to be talking
about in this lecture

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.090
are native or close to
native speakers of Russian.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.950
And so in a tale which is going

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.570
to be largely about espionage,

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.430
this matters an awful lot, right?

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.830
So all the Poles that I'm
going to be talking about

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.780
in this lecture, with maybe
one or two exceptions,

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.550
were educated in the Russian Empire

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.440
and went through Russian schools

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.480
and therefore as adults
in the '20s and '30s

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.150
were native or very close
to native Russian speakers.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.770
Some of them have spent time in Siberia,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.750
like Jozef Pilsudski, which only, I mean,

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.180
that improves your Russian
in certain ways, right?

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.950
I mean, it gives you the prison part

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.470
of the Russian language,
which can come in handy.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.010
Okay, so the two main traditions

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.500
in Polish politics that had formed

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.060
by 1918 already are the
Polish Socialist Party,

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.017
in Polish, the PPS, Polska
Partia Socjalistyczna,

00:10:46.017 --> 00:10:50.460
PPS on your sheets, and
the National Democrats.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.000
So interestingly, the two poles, sorry,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.150
in Polish political life, it
wasn't intended as a joke,

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.390
it just came out that way,
are already established

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.680
before there's a Polish state.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.380
And these two poles are
basically the same today,

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.213
by the way.

00:11:05.213 --> 00:11:08.130
It's a very coherent development.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.900
So the Polish Socialist Party
is obviously center left.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.300
Its dominant view is there
should be a state first

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.430
and then we'll build socialism later.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.640
The Polish Socialist Party
tends to be nostalgic

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.130
towards the old
commonwealth and to believe

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.910
that some future Poland
will be a federation,

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:31.110
not a nation-state, so a kind
of modernized commonwealth

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.080
in which the Belarusian, Lithuanian,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.540
Ukrainian nations will somehow be present

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.850
and in which the Jews will
have some kind of autonomy.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.380
That's the idea.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.403
That's the idea.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.080
On the center right,
the National Democrats,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.760
there's a very different vision.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.110
Their attitude towards the history

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.220
of Poland is very different.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.340
The National Democrats say,
"Forget about the commonwealth.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.405
It fell. It was worthless.

00:11:55.405 --> 00:11:58.050
The nobility was not the nation.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.970
The nation is really the peasants.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.950
They just don't know it yet.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.170
Our job is to take the
Polish-speaking peasants

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.790
and to make them into Poles.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.170
That's what a movement is for.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.820
That's what the state is for.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.320
We're not concerned about the Germans

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.030
and the Jews and the Ukrainians and so on.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.620
They're not really Poles.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.390
They probably never will be Poles.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.340
Maybe the Belarusians
and Ukrainians will be,

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.260
but certainly not the
Germans and the Jews."

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.820
So their attitude is very different.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.430
The Germans and the Jews
are national enemies,

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.650
and the Slavs are maybe assimilable,

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.000
but if they're not assimilable,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.130
then they can also be national enemies.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.170
The National Democrats are
thinking about a nation-state.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.160
They're thinking about a nation-state

00:12:34.058 --> 00:12:38.100
where the nation in question
is the Polish nation.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.120
So these are the two
currents in Polish politics

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.160
which are already present,
and when I tell the story

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.770
of the '20s and '30s, it's
really these two currents

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.920
which are going to be
alternating in power,

00:12:49.943 --> 00:12:51.333
very much like today.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.503
Okay, so Poland,

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.850
unlike Ukraine, at the end
of the First World War,

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.145
is regarded by the Entente as an ally.

00:13:03.145 --> 00:13:04.682
This is really important.

00:13:04.682 --> 00:13:06.750
By the Entente, of
course, I mean the French,

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.740
the British, the Americans,
the victorious Western powers.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.490
In the Paris peace settlements,
they regard some countries

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.370
as effectively their allies
and some countries not,

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.490
and this is only vaguely
related to what actually happens

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.670
during the war itself,
and it has a lot to do

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.130
with the interests of those countries,

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:30.240
especially France, in the years to come.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.340
So the French take the most punishment

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.270
in the First World War.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.340
It's largely fought on French territory.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.100
The French are most concerned
about the balance of power

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.470
on the continent after
the First World War.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.230
The peace talks are held in Paris

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.950
or in nice spa towns around Paris nearby.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.980
And it's generally French
interests that prevail.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.580
In Poland, you have an overlap

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.340
of the principle that was announced,

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.316
national self-determination.

00:13:58.316 --> 00:14:00.270
Woodrow Wilson specifies

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.550
that Poland will become
an independent state.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.760
So the principle of national
self-determination is applied.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.210
But also France wants Poland to exist

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.260
because France wants an ally
to the east of Germany, right?

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.720
If you are France...

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.840
I'm trying to think of, like...

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.240
You're playing Risk, right? Okay.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.290
So if you're France,
you always want the ally

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.180
to the east of Germany,
and if you're Germany,

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.160
you're always afraid of, right?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.750
It's that classical situation.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.990
So if you're France,
you're not so concerned

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.110
about who that is and
what their regime is.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.110
France had been allies
with the Russian Empire,

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.460
right, for this reason.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.200
So the Russian Empire is done with,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.370
and what do the French do?

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:49.050
The French say independent
Poland, and they ally

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.770
or they try to support the
Whites in the Russian Civil War.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.320
So they're supporting
the pro-imperial forces

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.310
in the Russian Civil War.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:57.750
They lose, as we already know,

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.580
but that's what the
French we're banking on.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.730
So the French want allies
to the east of Germany.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.260
So those two things
come together this time,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.875
principle and practice,
in the creation of Poland.

00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:09.840
So the Western allies are
going to support the creation

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.270
of Poland, not that the Poles
don't fight for it, they do,

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:16.020
but they have two things
which the Ukrainians don't.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.610
Nobody is saying that
Ukraine has the right

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.700
to self-determination
except for Germany in 1918,

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.470
and that doesn't count for very much,

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:27.460
and nobody thinks that the
existence of a Ukrainian state

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:32.430
is in their strategic
interests except for Poland,

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.170
and that in a very limited sense,

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.880
which we're going to get to.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.420
Okay, so this brings us to,

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.300
you know, the basic relationship,

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.280
it's kind of an
intellectually beautiful thing

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.020
to think about, the relationship

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:50.850
between a revolution and borders, right?

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.430
Because a revolution doesn't have borders.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.280
A revolution is a total transformation.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.547
When you talk about a
revolution, you don't say

00:15:57.547 --> 00:16:00.210
"I want a revolution
in my backyard," right?

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.200
You don't say, "I want a..."

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.050
A revolution is about
total transformation.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.940
So the French Revolution wasn't,

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.020
I mean, it was about France,

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.810
but it was also about invading
the rest of Europe, right?

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.480
Because it was about principles.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.580
The Russian Revolution, as
we talked about last time,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.190
was not meant to be about Russia at all.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.170
It was meant to be a global revolution

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.713
which just happened to take
a starting point in Russia.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.710
But then we get to the
very practical question

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.060
of what happens when the revolution

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.550
that you've made turns
out not to be global.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.100
Where does it end, then, right?

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.540
That very mundane question.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.740
Where does it end?

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.440
And that question is going
to be decided largely

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.870
by the use of force between Poland

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:44.340
and the Soviet Union in 1919 and 1920.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.890
So if we think of the stretch of territory

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.563
between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea,

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.720
Estonia, Lithuania,
Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.290
that stretch of territory
is a kind of power vacuum

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.570
at the end of the First World War.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.940
The Entente has won the war,

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.800
but they won it on the Western Front.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.590
The German Army was exhausted
on the Western Front.

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:10.320
The German Army is
exhausted fighting in France

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.080
against the Americans, the
British, and the French.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.140
So the Germans lose, but they lose the war

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.090
having never been defeated in the East,

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:21.399
which is an odd situation and
very important for everybody.

00:17:21.399 --> 00:17:23.970
From a Western point of view,
it's easy to forget about.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.530
But from an East European point of view

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.900
or even a German point
of view, it's central.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.790
It's central to the
Nazis, by the way, too.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.655
It's central to everything
that's going to come next.

00:17:32.655 --> 00:17:36.240
From the point of view of
German soldiers in the East,

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.740
there never was a defeat.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.390
They just had to come home at some point.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.650
They were never beaten.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.993
They just had to come home. Okay.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.910
So after 1918, there's a power vacuum

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.550
because there's been been a revolution.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.010
In 1917, the Russian Revolution
destroys the Russian Empire.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.490
In 1918, the German and
Austrian armies move in

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.920
to support their version of Ukraine,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.430
and then they're defeated,
so they move back out.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:07.080
And what's left is a vacuum
which, on the Polish side,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.390
Jozef Pilsudski, who is the leader

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.730
of the Polish Socialist
Party and also the leader

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:16.730
of the Polish state, wishes to
fill, and on the other side,

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.520
Vladimir Lenin, the leader
of the Bolshevik party

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.690
and de facto of the Russian
state, also wants to fill.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.810
But the interesting idea here
which I want you to notice

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.480
is that neither of them wants to fill it

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.090
on behalf of nation-states.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.400
That's not the kind of
idea they have in mind.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.370
Lenin is thinking of a global...

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.450
Where did I lose you?

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.310
Where did I lose you?

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.800
Know that I'm sensing confusion
in the middle of the room.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.850
No? You're okay?

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.750
You're fine? Okay.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.070
They can't edit that out, by the way.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.180
That's going to be on the video.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.130
It's there forever.

00:18:54.662 --> 00:18:56.310
So Pilsudski is thinking

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.400
about some kind of vague federation.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.920
He's not thinking Poland for the Poles.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.270
That's not his idea at all.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.600
His idea is somehow the
Lithuanians, the Belarusians,

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.300
and the Ukrainians somehow
also in this, right?

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.760
Whether they would be equal
partners or not is less clear,

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.860
but somehow, some kind of larger state

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.450
which is not just Poland for the Poles.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.460
He wants more Lithuanians,
more Belarusians,

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.803
more Ukrainians, more Jews in the state.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.190
Lenin's idea is also not...

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.470
Obviously it's not a nation-state.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.600
Lenin's idea is global revolution.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.680
And so by the moment
we're talking about, 1919,

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.980
it's already clear that
the world isn't going

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.950
to have a revolution just
because Russia did, okay?

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.200
And this is the key to the, like...

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.700
This is like the original sin,

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.960
if you want, of the Soviet Union,

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.120
or it's the key to how
things work out later,

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.690
because Lenin and Trotsky, the Bolsheviks,

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.940
they didn't think they were
starting a Russian revolution.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.290
They thought that they were the powder keg

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.640
for a global revolution.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.520
Then what do you do when the
global revolution doesn't come?

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.897
Well, your next move is to say,

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:01.387
"Okay, we're going to
help it along," right?

00:20:01.387 --> 00:20:02.730
"We're going to help it along."

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:06.750
So once they have won
the Russian Civil War,

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.440
their next move is to think,
"We're going to go into Europe

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.200
and we'll help out the German
comrades, because obviously,

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.000
Germany's the most
important country in Europe.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.950
If we can get to Berlin,

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.170
then there can be revolution in Germany,

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.610
and then there will be world revolution."

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:21.840
So stage one is,

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.790
your theory is there should
be global revolution.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.170
Stage two is that your practice is,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.100
you've got to get to Europe

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.080
and help out the German comrades.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.900
But what's in the way? Poland.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.190
And the Poles aren't just in the way.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.300
They're moving east.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.300
So this sets up the Polish-Bolshevik
War of 1919 to 1920.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:43.850
As I mentioned last time, the
furthest the Poles ever get

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:48.033
in this war is Kyiv in May of 1920,

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.370
the victory in Kyiv with the,
you know, the circular march

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.160
of the Polish cavalry around Khreshchatyk.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.150
That is followed by the
Red Army's march on Warsaw,

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.910
where what's called the miracle,

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:04.830
the Vistula, the Poles' defeat...

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:05.663
It's called the miracle.

00:21:05.663 --> 00:21:07.740
The Vistula is the river
that runs through Poland.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.160
The miracle on the Vistula was
originally sarcastic, like,

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.090
in the sense of "after what
you did, we needed a miracle"

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.420
because this war was contested
inside Poland itself.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.900
The National Democrats,
the right, opposed the war.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.520
They didn't want to
expand Polish territory.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.930
They wanted the nation-state, right?

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.007
And so for them, this was
a dangerous adventure.

00:21:27.007 --> 00:21:28.980
"Why are we going all the way to Kyiv?

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:29.820
Look what you did.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.040
You brought the Red Army
to the suburbs of Warsaw.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:32.970
We need a miracle."

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.830
But that sarcastic miracle on the Vistula

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.830
eventually became a non-sarcastic
miracle on the Vistula.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.010
It's now just a kind of neutral
name of the achievement.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.003
So the Poles hold off the Red Army

00:21:43.003 --> 00:21:45.630
at the gates of Warsaw, basically,

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.390
and stage a very successful counterattack,

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.510
drive the Red Army deep
into Ukraine and to Belarus,

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.850
at which point both sides are exhausted

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:54.810
and a peace is signed,

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:58.290
and that's the Treaty of
Riga of March of 1921.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:03.290
So the Treaty of Riga creates an effect...

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.590
And you know, and this is
something to think about

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:08.550
when a war is being fought.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.000
Where the border is in
large measure defines

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.730
what kind of states are
then going to exist.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.100
Because on the Polish side,

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.110
what you end up getting
is not a federation.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.060
It's not big enough for that.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.246
There are a lot of Belarusians, a million.

00:22:25.246 --> 00:22:28.620
There are a lot of
Ukrainians, five million plus.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.929
There are a lot of Jews, three million.

00:22:30.929 --> 00:22:34.080
But there aren't enough
for a federation, right?

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.550
This is a state, nevertheless,

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.010
which has a clear majority
of Polish speakers,

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.760
and so what it becomes
is a Polish nation-state

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.740
with big national minorities.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.777
It's not exactly what the
National Democrats wanted

00:22:45.777 --> 00:22:48.390
and it's also not what Pilsudski wanted,

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.010
but that's what the
borders of Riga create.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:54.060
They create this Poland with
big national minorities,

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.980
substantial national minorities.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.690
On the Soviet side,

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:01.590
what the Treaty of Riga does
is that it creates a border.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.500
It means the revolution has stopped.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.570
For now, at least, the
revolution has a border,

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.260
which is to say the Soviet
Union has to become a state,

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.093
which it does.

00:23:11.093 --> 00:23:13.830
And the Bolsheviks are making
this up as they go along.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.720
They're making this up as they go along,

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.547
their response to the defeat.

00:23:17.547 --> 00:23:18.570
And they were defeated.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:19.770
The Poles defeated them.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.350
They're not going to be defeated again

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.540
until Afghanistan in 1979,

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.723
but the Red Army is
defeated by Poland in 1920.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.440
And so the response to Polish
defeat is to create this thing

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.050
that we take for granted,
which is the Soviet Union.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:37.290
The Soviet Union is the state
which contains the revolution.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.000
So it's not supposed to be a normal state.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.350
It's not a nation-state.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.940
From the Soviet, from the
Bolshevik point of view,

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.290
it's certainly not an empire.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.190
It's something completely new.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.170
It's a kind of container for revolution,

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.380
a revolution which at some
later date will get spread

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.430
throughout the world.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.050
In the meantime, it becomes the task

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.510
of the Soviet comrades to
complete the revolution

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:59.310
inside their own borders and
to model it for everyone else.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.820
Okay, so now that's,

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.870
so in Poland, what follows from this

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:11.643
is a certain fundamental
difficulty for democracy.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.920
In Poland, you have two basic questions

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.570
which make parliamentary
democracy difficult

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.620
right from the beginning.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.160
One of them and the most
important is the land question.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.470
And I realize I keep beating
you over the head with this,

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.750
but in the first half of the 20th century,

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.570
land was the most important
question in politics,

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.190
not anything else but land,

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.740
because most people in
the part of the world

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.036
that we're studying, at
least, were peasants,

00:24:40.036 --> 00:24:43.470
and in general, they wanted to
have more land than they did.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.720
This was still an economy,
and we're, you know,

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.550
in much the world, it's
still true, but in Europe,

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.320
in our part of Europe,
this is still an economy

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.927
where most people have small plots of land

00:24:51.927 --> 00:24:53.100
and want to have bigger plots of land

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.220
or have no land and
want to have more land.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.930
And because, you know...

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:02.070
The economy itself is
still agrarian, right?

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.963
This is the center of politics.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.780
If you want to, you
can think of everything

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:11.160
that happens in Poland, Soviet
Union, and even Nazi Germany

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.370
as an answer to the land question,

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:17.610
where the Poles try to do
land reform and kind of fail.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.175
Land reform means you take
from people who have more land,

00:25:20.175 --> 00:25:21.270
give it to people who have less land.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.780
The Soviets at the end of
the day take everyone's land

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.580
and create collective farming.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.250
Even Hitler's ideas that you
should invade Eastern Europe

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.220
and take the land, that's a solution

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.630
to the land question, right?

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:38.010
So the key to a lot of this is land,

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.360
people wanting more land.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.330
So in Polish politics,
as in Eastern Europe,

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.250
as in democratic Eastern
Europe in general,

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:48.750
the key question was land,
and the difficulty was trying

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.240
to get the peasants
interested in politics,

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.410
trying to get the peasants to see

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.980
that democratic politics
somehow serves their interests.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.550
And the best way to do
that is land reform, right?

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:00.990
That's something the state can do for you

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.823
if you're a peasant.

00:26:01.823 --> 00:26:04.620
It can take some land from
your wealthy neighbor,

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:05.453
from that person

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:09.510
who owned the plantation

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:11.280
that your grandfather was a serf in,

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.110
take some land from that
person and give it to you.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:14.460
That's something the state can do.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.070
The Poles do that to some degree.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.980
But here's where the
national question comes in.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.800
In Poland, there was a peasant party,

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.490
but it was a Polish peasant party, right?

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:28.740
It wasn't just a peasant party.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.650
This is really, really, really important.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:35.040
There was no class party
for the peasants of Poland.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.580
And even more than in the Polish areas,

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.210
in the Belarusian and Ukrainian areas,

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.100
most people were peasants.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.100
So this means that basically,
in democratic elections,

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.810
the Belarusian and Ukrainian
peasants were excluded

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.760
because there was no
party they could vote for

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.780
which really had a chance

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.520
of exercising any kind of influence.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.680
Had there been a peasant
party representing peasants

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.730
as such, that party would've
won every time, right?

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.400
But there was no such
party, and so therefore,

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.630
everything switches around,

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.563
and if you're a Belarusian peasant

00:27:07.563 --> 00:27:09.487
or a Ukrainian peasant, you can think,

00:27:09.487 --> 00:27:12.993
"Well, the Polish peasants
seem to be getting some land,

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.470
but I don't seem to be
getting any land," right?

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.470
And so then the land question is magnified

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.970
by the national question.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:24.240
And this is one of the ways
that Polish politics turns

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.180
in the first half of the 1920s where,

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.330
when Poland is being ruled by coalitions

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:35.330
of National Democrats and the
Polish Peasant Party, right?

00:27:35.463 --> 00:27:38.970
So you can see the setup for this.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:43.710
The setup for this means that you have,

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.750
if you're the Soviet Union,
we'll talk more about this,

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.020
but if you're the Soviet
Union looking at Poland,

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.680
there is a huge opening for you.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.350
You can speak to Ukrainians
and to Belarusians

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.450
about national liberation,

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.120
and you can speak to
them about land reform.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.980
Now obviously, at the end of the day,

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.690
we know that the Soviet Union is not going

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.240
to be the homeland of national
liberation or land reform.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.510
But in the 1920s, this was propaganda.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.720
This was an approach that
the Soviets could take.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.660
And in the 1920s, it
seemed pretty reasonable,

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.000
we're going to talk more about
this, because in the 1920s,,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.530
the Soviets were engaged in something

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:20.820
Poland was not engaged in,

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.190
which was affirmative
action for Ukrainians,

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.920
giving Ukrainians
educational opportunities,

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.770
building schools and universities,
pulling Ukrainians up

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:30.480
through the ranks of the administration.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.800
They were also engaged in
allowing Ukrainian peasants

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.290
to keep the land they took
from Polish landlords.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.363
So this is a very basic way that Poland

00:28:38.363 --> 00:28:40.765
and the Soviet Union
were different, right?

00:28:40.765 --> 00:28:44.100
In the revolution, 1917, '18,

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.140
a lot of what happens in Ukraine,

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.210
especially Right-bank Ukraine,

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.400
is that Ukrainian peasants take land

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.710
from historic Polish landlords

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:54.930
and then those historic
Polish landlords flee west

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.150
to Poland, which from the
point of view of Poland

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:00.090
is ethnic cleansing and oppression, right?

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.920
But from the point of view
of the Ukrainian peasants,

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.670
it's "We finally got the land
that we've been working."

00:29:05.857 --> 00:29:07.680
And so from the point of
view of a Ukrainian peasant,

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.870
that was a good revolution, right?

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.040
That was a good revolution.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.720
That was a revolution or
a part of the revolution

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.553
that we want to keep.

00:29:13.553 --> 00:29:16.890
And in the 1920s, the
Bolsheviks were not able

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:18.390
to do anything about that

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.670
and so they allowed it to maintain itself.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.110
That was called the New Economic Policy.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:26.430
So in the 1920s, Ukrainian
peasants got more land,

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.320
they got fewer Polish landlords,

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.060
and Ukrainian educated people

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.050
were getting affirmative action,

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:32.970
none of which existed in Poland, right?

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.490
So in the 1920s, if
you're the Soviet Union,

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.650
you can make propaganda against Poland

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.600
because of these basic realities.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.062
Okay, in Poland, there is,
if we get more specific now,

00:29:44.062 --> 00:29:47.430
there is a big difference

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.760
between the two Ukrainian districts,

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.080
and now we're getting to the stuff that,

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.580
like, 30 years down the line,

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.860
you're going to be making
cocktail party conversation with

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.930
when you explain to people
about the difference

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.290
between Galicia and Volhynia, right?

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:04.090
And you guys are already
halfway there because you know,

00:30:06.139 --> 00:30:09.150
(laughing) because you know
that Galicia is the part

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:11.310
that came from the
Habsburg monarchy, right?

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.830
You know that the name Galicia, Galizien,

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.930
was invented basically by the Habsburgs

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.850
to name territory they took in 1772

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.100
and that territory, Galicia,
ends up being part of Poland.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.690
The Poles call it something
completely different.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:28.080
They call it Malopolska
Wschodnia, Eastern Little Poland.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.260
But it's the eastern part of Galicia.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.630
Volhynia is something very different.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.960
Volhynia has been part
of the Russian Empire

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.310
this entire time.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.990
Volhynia has been part
of the Russian Empire

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.640
for more than a hundred years.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.620
In Volhynia, unlike Galicia,

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.010
people belong to the Orthodox Church,

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.740
not the Greek Catholic Church.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.940
In Volhynia, there are far fewer Poles

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.960
and fewer Jews than there are in Galicia,

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.340
and also the standard of
comparison is very different.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.920
So one of the main problems

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.830
for the Poles trying to govern Galicia

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:12.830
is that if you're a Galician
Ukrainian, after 1918,

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.930
everything got worse for
you in a couple of ways.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.510
So politics is very
much about expectations.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:23.407
If you're a Ukrainian in
Galicia, you might have expected

00:31:23.407 --> 00:31:25.743
"We are going to get our own state"

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.340
because between November of
1918 and the spring of 1919,

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.770
there was a West Ukrainian
National Republic,

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.900
and it was defeated by none other

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.550
than the Polish Army, right?

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:40.710
And so if you're a Ukrainian,

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.960
that's a disappointment, right?

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.690
And there's nothing the Polish
state can do to repair that,

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.251
because from the point of
view of the Polish state,

00:31:47.251 --> 00:31:49.740
this is Polish territory.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.040
The second frame of reference
is the Habsburg monarchy.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.290
So if we're going to be
governed by someone else,

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:58.080
we're used to having certain
things, freedom of speech,

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.690
freedom of assembly,
free political parties.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:02.250
We're used to having schools.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.290
We're used to being able to
serve in the administration.

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:07.020
Under Polish rule, a lot
of that will be taken away.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.660
There will be fewer
Ukrainian-speaking schools.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.700
Ukrainians in general will be excluded

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.350
from the state administration in Poland,

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:16.994
which they were not in
the Habsburg monarchy.

00:32:16.994 --> 00:32:21.120
The Greek Catholic Church
will not be treated as equal.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.620
So in all these ways, the positions

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.810
of Ukrainians in Galicia is actually worse

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:25.950
than it was in the Habsburg monarchy,

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.120
and they're very well aware of this,

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.860
and they're used to talking about this.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.380
And it's not easy for
them to situate themselves

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.730
in the Polish state.

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.482
Eventually by the late 1930s
when things are very bad,

00:32:35.482 --> 00:32:38.370
the main position among
Ukrainians will be something

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.410
like "Poland is better
than the alternatives."

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.470
But better than the alternatives
is not a rallying cry

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.330
for everyday politics in general.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:49.170
So the main force in Ukrainian politics

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:52.860
is something called Undo,
U-N-D-O, it's on your sheet,

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.630
which takes a kind of centrist position,

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:57.630
not sure about the Polish
state in the 1920s.

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:58.560
Many people thinking

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.860
that maybe the Soviet
Union might be better,

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.730
feeling left out of Polish
politics with justification.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:10.350
There is a right-wing
fraction, a very small group,

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:13.770
called the OUN, the Organization
of Ukrainian Nationalists,

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.770
which is a typical, looking
at this from the point of view

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:18.330
of, you know, political science,

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.300
a typical reaction to
exclusion from democracy.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.000
If, you know, if you go
from a more democratic

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.710
to a less democratic situation,

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.720
there will probably be
some group which decides

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.250
that the answer to this is violence

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.050
against the institutions, and that group

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:33.108
is the Organization of
Ukrainian Nationalists.

00:33:33.108 --> 00:33:37.500
In interwar Poland, they
were not very significant.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.850
They were not very numerous.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.400
The Poles did a pretty good
job of locking them up.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:45.510
They did assassinate a few
Polish officials after 1926.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.640
In general, they
assassinated, as one does,

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.140
the people who were in favor of some kind

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.120
of accommodation or compromise, right?

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.970
You don't assassinate the
radicals on the other side.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:56.363
I mean, I feel like I'm now
giving you a training course,

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:00.420
so don't take it that way,
but you see the logic, right?

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.490
You assassinate the
moderates on the other side

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:04.435
because if you're a radical,

00:34:04.435 --> 00:34:06.780
you prefer the radicals on the other side.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.040
You prefer conflict.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.450
You don't want the compromisers

00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:10.980
because the compromisers might make a deal

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:13.380
with your compromisers and
then you'd be out of business

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.640
and your radical vision wouldn't seem

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.090
like it makes a lot of sense.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.960
I mentioned the OUN because
it'll become more important

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.610
during the war, but it's
actually not that important

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:23.010
during the '20s and '30s.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:26.250
So the early '20s in Poland are a time

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:30.990
of democratic politics

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:32.460
in which the land question

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.070
is only very unsatisfactorily answered

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.590
and the national question,
if you're not Polish,

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:39.300
is not answered at all.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.930
This changes a bit in 1926.

00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:45.180
In 1926, Poland becomes
much less democratic,

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:47.640
but the people who come
to power are more open

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.540
on the national question.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:52.680
In 1926, Jozef Pilsudski,
the former head of state,

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:56.940
comes back to power by
way of a military coup

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.293
and installs what we, I think,

00:34:59.293 --> 00:35:01.429
would be very comfortable calling,

00:35:01.429 --> 00:35:03.690
borrowing some Russian terminology,

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.673
a managed democracy, right?

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:08.400
I mean, it's managed better

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.890
than the current Russian
democracy, non-democracy, is.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.870
But there are political parties.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:13.950
There is voting.

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:15.720
There's a certain amount
of massaging of the vote.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.070
There's a certain amount
of disenfranchisement.

00:35:20.209 --> 00:35:21.930
It's kind of a democracy,

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:24.240
but you also kind of already
know who's going to win

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.640
before the elections take place.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.400
So he overthrows a democracy,

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.260
installs a kind of managed democracy

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.140
with his own political party and then,

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.210
you know, governs from behind the scenes.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:38.040
It's not really a dictatorship,

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.740
but it's an authoritarian regime.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.280
From our point of view,
the difference here,

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.140
the relevant difference,
if you remember between,

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.280
you know, the basic orientations,
center left, center right,

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.890
the center left is more open
on the national question,

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:56.490
more tolerant of Jews, more
open on the national question.

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:59.580
And what Pilsudski then begins to do,

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.260
with no democratic legitimation,

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.460
this is never talked about at all,

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.040
everything I'm about to talk
about was kept entirely secret

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.600
from the Polish population,
with no democratic legitimation,

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.850
he then undertakes a policy of trying

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:16.080
to tolerate the Ukrainian
national identity

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.110
in part of Poland, partly with the hope

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.510
of undoing Soviet influence.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:22.530
So the Soviet influence,

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:26.040
as I've already tried to
suggest, was very real.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.240
The Soviets in the 1920s

00:36:28.113 --> 00:36:30.510
are in a rather beautiful
strategic situation

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.570
with respect to Poland, as
I've already tried to suggest.

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:37.560
In 1923, the Soviets
promulgate their doctrine

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.160
on colonialism and nationalism,
which is very clever.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.060
It basically says that
nationalism is reactionary

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.700
inside the Soviet Union but
outside the Soviet Union

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.200
is progressive, right?

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.373
Which is a very convenient position.

00:36:52.373 --> 00:36:56.730
So, you know, it's the Leninist view

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.710
of national self-determination that,

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.810
sure, everybody has a right in principle

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.210
to a nation-state, it just...

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.170
In practice, it depends

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.099
on whether this serves us or not, right?

00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:11.010
So anti-colonial movements
in India are great, right?

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:14.130
As are anti-colonial
movements in Poland. Super.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.050
Anti-colonial movements in Central Asia

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:18.870
or the Caucasus or
Ukraine, not at all, right?

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:22.290
But so what this allows them to do

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:26.580
is it allows them to use
the national question

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.250
and the question of land against Poland

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:30.480
but also against the British Empire.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.340
I mean, the Soviets were engaged

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.500
with the British Empire as well.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.720
But for our purposes,
Poland is what matters.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.720
So what they do is that they
try to present Soviet Ukraine

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.720
as a sovereign Ukrainian state
where peasants have land,

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.370
where there are national freedoms,

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:50.580
and try in this way to draw the millions

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.310
of Ukrainians in Poland
towards the Soviet Union

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:56.223
and destabilize the Polish state.

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.740
And as I say, this was carried out

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.723
with a great deal of success.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:06.570
What Pilsudski does is that
he tries to reverse this.

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:10.320
So in Galicia, he never has a chance.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.754
In Galicia, there is already,

00:38:12.754 --> 00:38:15.030
when they come to power in '26,

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:18.840
the Ukrainian nationalists
assassinate the Polish officials

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.320
and you get a spiral of
reprisals and counter-reprisals

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.990
which discredit the
Polish state in Galicia.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.310
In any event, in Galicia,

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:29.070
there just wasn't a kind of
fresh terrain to work in.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.890
What they do is they take Volhynia

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:35.700
and they try to educate a generation

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.850
of pro-Polish Ukrainians in Volhynia.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:42.930
They carry out a policy known
as the Volhynian Experiment

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:47.580
from 1928, led by a man
called Henryk Jozewski,

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:49.320
who's on your sheet.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.470
And what Jozewski does is a kind of,

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.810
it's kind of a capitalist or a bourgeois

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:58.950
or a liberal version of
Soviet affirmative action.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:02.460
So he places Ukrainians

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.373
in Volhynia in local government.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:11.540
He encourages the use of
the Ukrainian language

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.083
in the Orthodox Church.

00:39:15.145 --> 00:39:17.200
He encourages a movement

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:23.640
towards autocephaly in the
Ukrainian Orthodox Church

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.410
on Polish territory.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:28.710
And he talks about Ukrainian independence.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:33.510
He talks about a replay of
the Polish-Bolshevik War

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.510
in which this time, Poland would win

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:40.860
and the creation of a Ukrainian state.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.343
Now, Jozewski was a true
believer in all of this.

00:39:45.257 --> 00:39:46.713
He was from Kyiv.

00:39:49.157 --> 00:39:51.570
He was authentically in
love with Ukrainian culture

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:53.070
and songs, literature.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:55.680
He spoke Ukrainian like a native.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.810
He deeply believed that Ukrainian

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.480
and Polish culture were
fundamentally very similar

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.030
and that Russian culture
was something different.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:06.567
But in general, one of
course has to ask, you know,

00:40:06.567 --> 00:40:10.050
one has to be a little
bit critical all the same.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:12.210
Is this idea of Ukraine, you know,

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:13.560
is it for the Ukrainians

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.540
or is it about creating a buffer state?

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.590
Because if you're Poland,

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:20.280
it's better to have something
between you and Russia.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.990
And for the Poles who were involved,

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:23.100
it was a mixture of motives.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.850
I mean, there was certainly
idealism involved,

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.770
but there was also this
notion that it would be better

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:31.800
to have Ukraine for our
own strategic interests.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.190
So what the Poles do is under the cover

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:37.170
of this toleration project,

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.510
they're also educating young Ukrainians,

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:42.070
training them for espionage missions

00:40:43.743 --> 00:40:45.960
inside Soviet Ukraine.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.290
And they also, and this
is not widely known,

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:54.290
but they also revive a
government in exile for Ukraine.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.210
They revive the Ukrainian
National Republic

00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:59.280
on their own territory.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:04.280
They set up a staff for
a Ukrainian army in 1927

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:07.170
with sections for propaganda
and for intelligence.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:11.160
And in 1928, this Ukrainian
army on Polish soil begins

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.883
to run its agents across
the Soviet border.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.440
From the point of view of Poland,

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.600
this is part of a larger project

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.343
which is known as Prometheanism.

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:26.882
And this, again, you should, like...

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:30.450
It's a really interesting
point of contrast

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:31.290
to Poland of today.

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.570
A lot of the ideas that
I'm talking about now

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:36.930
have a faint echo in Polish policy today,

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:38.430
but it's a pretty faint echo.

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:41.460
The Poles in the '20s and '30s
were a lot more adventurous

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.983
on these issues than
the Polish state is now.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:47.050
The idea of Prometheanism

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.823
was national self-determination,

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:55.710
national self-determination
for the oppressed nations

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:57.120
of the Soviet Union.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.890
And so the Poles,

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.020
in secret, this was not an
open-forum policy at all,

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.630
but in secret, they funded and helped

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.240
with the publications
of and sometimes helped

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.950
run people across borders
for Caucasian nations,

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:15.950
for Georgia, for Chechens,
and also for Ukrainians.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.210
And the basic idea of this

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:23.010
is that it's trying to flip
what the Soviets are saying.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.577
So the Soviets are saying,

00:42:24.577 --> 00:42:26.760
"We have national self-determination.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.710
Look at our beautiful national liberation.

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:30.420
Look at these republics."

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.370
And the Poles are saying, "No, actually,

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:34.950
the national question is your weakness,

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.050
and there are all these
immigrant politicians

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:40.382
who agree with us and we're
going to support them."

00:42:40.382 --> 00:42:42.900
And this larger policy of
Prometheanism had connections

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.630
with the British and the French and even,

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:49.770
interestingly, in the
Japanese, all of whom,

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:52.097
for their various reasons, had reasons

00:42:52.097 --> 00:42:57.097
to try to weaken the Soviet Union.

00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:01.893
Now, so up until 1933,

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.610
if you read the files, which,

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:07.170
one summer, I was able to do...

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:10.980
There was a summer when the
Polish military archives

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.990
were entirely closed, but for some reason,

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.970
they let me just sit
there and read them all,

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:15.803
which was great.

00:43:15.803 --> 00:43:17.463
I literally used a shopping cart,

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:20.010
which is not normal archival practice.

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:22.050
I had a shopping cart and I
filled up the shopping cart

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:24.201
with files, and then I read all the files,

00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:26.190
and then I went and got
another shopping cart.

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:27.023
That is the research

00:43:27.023 --> 00:43:28.470
which is in "Sketches from a Secret War,"

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:29.490
and that is why there's a lot

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:30.600
in "Sketches from a Secret War"

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.240
which you're not going
to find anywhere else.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.850
But the general drift, as you'll see

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:40.350
when you do the reading, is
that from 1926 to 1931, '32,

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:42.900
there's some really interesting
Polish intelligence work

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.520
going on in Ukraine

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.250
under this overall auspice
of the Volhynian Experiment,

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.060
under this overall
auspice of Prometheanism.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.730
We know a lot about the
agents and the rings

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:57.540
that the Poles were running
inside Soviet Ukraine

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.380
led by this man

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.683
with the close-to-unpronounceable
name of Jerzy Niezbrzycki,

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.800
who is a very interesting character.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.440
He, like a lot of these men and women,

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.030
because a lot of the agents and officers

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:11.640
in Polish intelligence,
by the way, were women,

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:15.030
was a Pole from Ukraine, so
someone who knew the territory,

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.313
knew the languages, was bilingual.

00:44:18.313 --> 00:44:19.923
Some of them were trilingual.

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:24.060
So he ran these agents,

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:27.690
and one of the stories which stays with me

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:32.100
because it reveals an
important difference is...

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.020
So a lot of this stuff is about sex.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.430
I don't know how you guys feel about that.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:38.973
Like, is it okay to talk
about sex? (laughing)

00:44:41.417 --> 00:44:42.750
I wish I could share with the camera,

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:45.060
like, the various reactions that that got.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.583
So a lot of the operations involve sex,

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:52.050
so Polish male officers
having sex with Soviet women

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.830
and Polish female officers
having sex with Soviet men,

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.900
or they involve relationships

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:01.680
in which sex is somehow
in the picture, right?

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.780
And so there's one example

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.080
which I found really
interesting because it gets us

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:11.670
to a kind of difference
between two systems

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:15.690
is when one of Niezbrzycki's
female friends,

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.190
who was a Polish intelligence officer

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:18.740
operating inside Ukraine...

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.690
This is not going to be
directly about sex. I'm sorry.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:23.290
It's all in the reading, though.

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:26.190
If you get, like, deep into the reading,

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.380
you'll find there's a
lot of sex with spies.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.213
Okay.

00:45:29.213 --> 00:45:33.180
But so he had a friend
who I'm going to call X22,

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.250
and what she did

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:40.050
was she exchanged consumer goods,

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.360
in particular nylon stockings,

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.250
which was something which
was trivially easy to get

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:46.740
in Poland but which did not
exist in the Soviet Union.

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.500
She would trade nylon stockings
and other similar things

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.870
for files and books from, you know,

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.270
her female friends' mail, like,

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:55.800
from their husbands' libraries

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.910
and their filing cabinets, right?

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:57.990
That was one of her methods.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.450
She had other methods of
operation, it's in the reading,

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.910
but that was one of her
methods of operation.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:04.860
And what this reveals,
you'll see where I'm going,

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.140
is that by 1931, '32,

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:11.940
we really have two very different systems.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.200
Poland is a capitalist country.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.190
It's a poor capitalist country.

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:15.510
It's a capitalist country.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:18.240
In the Soviet Union, by 1931, 1932,

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.100
we are in the middle of collectivization,

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.996
which will be our big subject next time.

00:46:21.996 --> 00:46:26.070
We're the middle of a
transformation of the Soviet Union

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:28.230
into a form of industrialized country,

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:30.900
which involves taking all of
the land away from the peasants

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:34.380
and putting them under
the control of the state.

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.230
And it is in this moment
of collectivization,

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:39.840
especially '28, '29, '30,

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:44.280
that Soviet Ukraine is
probably most at risk.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:49.280
In early 1930, the Soviet
secret police records

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:53.160
more than one million acts
of individual resistance

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:57.180
by peasants on the territory
of the Ukrainian Republic

00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:01.890
against collectivization, and
it's during this time also

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:06.570
that thousands upon thousands
of Ukrainian peasants

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:09.090
or peasants from Soviet
Ukraine flee to Romania

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:12.723
and flee to Poland to
escape collectivization.

00:47:14.537 --> 00:47:16.233
And when they come to Poland,

00:47:18.725 --> 00:47:19.890
they plea for war.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:24.090
So, I mean, we'll talk more
about it in the next lecture,

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.650
but it is a very dramatic situation

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:27.090
to suddenly lose your land

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:28.830
and to see everyone else losing their land

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:31.440
and to realize that you have no recourse.

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.970
So just to quote one peasant...

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:34.420
This is from Polish archives.

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:36.413
So it's interesting, right,

00:47:36.413 --> 00:47:37.770
because thousands and thousands

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:39.990
of Ukrainian peasants fled into Poland

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.190
and the Polish border guards

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:44.310
and other officials took notes, right?

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.390
And we have all of those notes.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:46.470
So we have, like, this report

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:48.690
of what was happening
inside collectivization

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:50.670
from the perspective of
the peasants themselves.

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:54.270
So one peasant says,
"And if a war broke out,

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:56.160
the mood of the people is such

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.200
that if the Polish Army appeared today,

00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.880
they would kiss the soldiers' feet

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.430
and the entire population
would attack the Bolsheviks."

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:04.620
Now, why is that interesting, right?

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.110
That is not the normal
Ukrainian peasant attitude

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.093
towards Poland at all, right?

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.890
That's from 1930, so
it's only a decade or so

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:15.000
after the Polish landlords

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.800
were kicked out the first time, right?

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.410
So it's a sign of how
bad collectivization is

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:22.260
that the peasants would be
calling for a Polish invasion.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.810
And this is that moment.

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:29.250
March of 1930 is when the
Soviets actually feared war.

00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:30.780
On the 17th of March...

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.920
It was March of 1930

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.730
when Stalin calls a temporary
halt to collectivization.

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:38.790
He gives one of his speeches
that is most remembered,

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:40.950
it's remembered as "Dizzy with Success,"

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:44.160
in which he basically
says it's going so well

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.020
that it's going badly, right?

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.820
He says, like, "Some of the comrades

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.530
are a little bit overenthusiastic.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:51.930
Collectivization was always
supposed to be voluntary.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:54.090
Let's just have a little pause, right?"

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:56.130
And that is because of the resistance,

00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:57.480
especially in Ukraine.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.750
It's also the same time, 17 March 1930,

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:05.750
that the Red Army is put
in full battle readiness

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.190
because they're expecting
an attack from Poland.

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:09.720
This is the moment when
they're most vulnerable.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.510
It's also the moment
where they're most afraid.

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:15.900
So you have refugees
fleeing Ukraine to Poland.

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.820
You have the Soviet Army
in full battle readiness.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:22.820
You have fear, but what you
don't have is a Polish attack.

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.647
The Poles look upon this and they say,

00:49:26.647 --> 00:49:29.250
"Well, the Soviet state is mobilizing.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.050
It's more powerful than we thought."

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.920
The Poles were always interested
in having more information

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.010
about Ukraine and about having
a Ukrainian alternative,

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:40.260
but the most they were ever planning for

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.990
was to use their Ukrainian agents

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:45.360
if the Soviet Union fell apart.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.330
They were never actually
planning an offensive war

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:49.680
against the Soviet Union.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.790
That was never part of their plan.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.200
So I can say this pretty definitively

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.330
because I've read the stuff.

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:58.000
So what happens is that
collectivization proceeds

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:04.130
and the Soviets ask
Poland for peace talks,

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.513
and the Poles say yes.

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:10.620
And in July of 1932,
Poland and the Soviet Union

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:14.006
sign a mutual nonaggression treaty,

00:50:14.006 --> 00:50:15.540
which is all well and good,

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.210
and it's a nice moment in
Polish-Soviet relations,

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:21.090
but from the point of view
of a class about Ukraine,

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:23.100
you see the consequences.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:27.660
It means that the Ukrainians
are left all alone

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.670
in the middle of collectivization.

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:32.490
There's no one to whom they can appeal.

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:34.380
The kind of statement that I read,

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.120
there are hundreds upon hundreds,

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.130
thousands upon thousands
of statements like that

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:40.350
of Ukrainian peasants
going to foreign consulates

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:42.780
and saying, you know, "Please let me out

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.460
or please invade," right?

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.660
That's what they say to the Germans

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:48.217
and the Poles in the early 1930s.

00:50:48.217 --> 00:50:49.650
"Invade. Let us out.

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:50.730
Invade. Let us out."

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:52.410
Over and over and over again.

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:54.090
But after Poland signs a peace treaty

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:56.070
with the Soviet Union in 1932,

00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:58.830
there's no one to whom they can appeal.

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:01.680
So that scene that I set
at the top of the lecture

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.940
when the Polish border guard
is sending the Ukrainian agent

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:08.490
across the border into Soviet Ukraine,

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:10.950
that is in December of 1933.

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:13.620
By December of 1933, it's impossible

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:16.620
that Poland is going to
come to the aid of Ukraine,

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.780
and by December of 1933,

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:21.060
about four million
Ukrainians will have starved

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:23.040
to death in the collectivization famine,

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.020
which is our subject next time.

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:25.853
Thanks.

00:51:31.652 --> 00:51:34.569
(thoughtful music)

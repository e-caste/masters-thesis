00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.296
Prof: Today we are going
to look at the three cantos in

00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:12.530
the eighth sphere of Dante's
cosmos;

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.265
we are beyond the planets,
beyond all this so called

00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:19.197
eighth sphere,
or the Heaven of the Fixed

00:00:19.197 --> 00:00:19.930
Stars.
 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.320
Before we get to,
which will be next week--

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.789
next time, the Empyrean,
the heaven of light and fire

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.756
but now we are in the heaven of
the fixed stars and Dante

00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:42.230
discusses the three theological
virtues.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.530
The three theological virtues,
unlike--

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.253
they are so called to
distinguish them from the

00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:52.785
cardinal virtues that Christians
share with the classical

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:57.505
tradition,
namely the fortitude,

00:00:57.505 --> 00:01:02.179
prudence, and justice,
etc.

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:09.162
These are the virtues that deal
with the understanding of the

00:01:09.162 --> 00:01:14.519
divine;
they open up this horizon of

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:20.830
speculations about the language
of God,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.769
the way God speaks to us,
theology in this sense,

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:26.890
the way in which we speak about
God,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.769
theology, the logos.
 

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:33.925
In theology there's the word
logos and the way God speaks to

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:38.022
us,
so it's the place in paradise

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:44.800
where Dante will focus on the
meaning of what I call--

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.288
it's not my phrase,
"basic words,"

00:01:48.288 --> 00:01:53.319
the words which are foundations
of the way in which we come out

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.555
to discover who we are;
they are words that we use,

00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:02.251
the words that we many not even
know exactly what they mean and

00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:05.129
yet Dante will try to define
them,

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:08.419
they are, I repeat faith,
hope and charity.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:13.389
The three virtues that Dante
will--

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:20.258
in this, using Paul's letter to
the Hebrews where he accounts or

00:02:20.258 --> 00:02:25.598
gives a definition at least of
faith and hope,

00:02:25.598 --> 00:02:29.057
but they are words--they are
terms that always implicate each

00:02:29.057 --> 00:02:29.520
other.
 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.705
You cannot go explaining faith
without really talking about

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:33.090
hope.
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.199
You cannot go on talking about
hope without explaining faith,

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:40.900
and both of them are
recapitulated and come together,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.792
gather within the question
of--within the virtue of charity

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:46.470
and the virtue of love.
 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.960
They are words that--they are
very mysterious in many ways but

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.370
there are degrees of
understanding all of them.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.728
The three examiners,
because Dante will go through

00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:04.818
the equivalent of a university
examination,

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:09.520
a medieval Bachelor's degree,
that's the term comes to us

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.823
from the universities,
medieval universities,

00:03:12.823 --> 00:03:13.590
the Bachelor.
 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.238
Dante is a bachelor who
presents himself to the teacher,

00:03:18.238 --> 00:03:22.717
the teacher is testing him,
and he will give an answer

00:03:22.717 --> 00:03:25.000
according to textbooks.
 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.793
Authentic--where the
authentic--the departed of one's

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:34.770
own beliefs, one's own hopes,
and one's own charity are

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.970
gathered.
 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.550
The three teachers are going to
be three Apostles who are known

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.530
as Peter for faith,
St.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.750
Peter for faith and that makes
sense because Peter himself,

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.699
the name stands for the
cornerstone on which the edifice

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:59.593
of Christian belief is built;
the second one is going to be

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:04.544
for the virtue of hope is going
to be James, known as the

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:08.971
Galician because--why him;
it would seem to be less

00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:13.081
obvious than the other two
because he among of all the

00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:17.889
Apostles is the one whose death
was recorded in the Acts of the

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.620
Apostles and so he lived in a
certain expectation of a life to

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.314
come,
so he would seem to be the real

00:04:26.314 --> 00:04:29.778
figure of hopefulness of some
idea of--

00:04:29.778 --> 00:04:36.670
some way of expecting a future
and the life of eternity.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:44.091
The virtue of charity instead,
is examined by John,

00:04:44.091 --> 00:04:49.879
the Apostle,
to distinguish him from the

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:55.670
seer, the writer of the
Apocalypse.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.523
So it's the three Apostles
Peter, James,

00:04:59.523 --> 00:05:00.610
and John.
 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.163
Are there ways in which we
could--I could give you some

00:05:05.163 --> 00:05:09.297
summary ways of trying to
understand some of these

00:05:09.297 --> 00:05:10.310
virtues.
 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.170
One thing that I would ask you
to look through when you have

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.550
time to go into detail of these
texts,

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.480
it seems to me that all the
three cantos deal,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.069
or have as a kind of what I
would call under text,

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.468
the subtext of them,
something running through but

00:05:31.468 --> 00:05:36.045
sometimes even visible but not
all the time visible,

00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:38.649
is the question of exile.
 

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:43.045
Dante is retrieving the
language of exile as if these

00:05:43.045 --> 00:05:48.456
virtues are clearly virtues that
don't concern at all the blessed

00:05:48.456 --> 00:05:51.966
in heaven;
they can only concern us here

00:05:51.966 --> 00:05:52.690
in time.
 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.973
The blessed in heaven certainly
do not need faith,

00:05:56.973 --> 00:06:02.307
or hope, or they don't really
need to know about what love may

00:06:02.307 --> 00:06:04.767
be;
either they have it or they

00:06:04.767 --> 00:06:09.528
wouldn't be there so this is--
but it's the language of exile

00:06:09.528 --> 00:06:14.807
is running through these three
issues just as the language of

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:17.995
time,
so the connection between time

00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:21.591
and exile probably needs not
much explanation,

00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:22.949
much glossing.
 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.048
We are in time,
we are fallen,

00:06:25.048 --> 00:06:29.319
and it's only in the language
of the fall that it's possible

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:31.129
to think about exile.
 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:35.617
The other element running
through this is really the

00:06:35.617 --> 00:06:40.105
question of, very visible,
especially in Canto XXVI,

00:06:40.105 --> 00:06:43.889
the actual question of language
itself.

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.500
What is the language of God?
 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.540
What are the names of God?
 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.959
Dante asks that question.
 

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:54.339
Are we talking about an entity
with a name,

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:57.976
and if so, you know the whole
debate about the so-called

00:06:57.976 --> 00:07:02.497
tetragrammaton,
the four letters that are

00:07:02.497 --> 00:07:05.480
supposedly that name God.
 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.069
That's what the word means,
the four letters.

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:14.550
Are they known or is God just
an effable?

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.127
Is there some--Is He some kind
of reality we can never even

00:07:19.127 --> 00:07:24.100
hope to name or are we going to
be related and connected to this

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.684
idea,
this knowledge of God by

00:07:26.684 --> 00:07:28.329
analogical discourse.
 

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:31.814
These are positions,
the mystical position that

00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:35.449
denies even our knowledge of the
name of God,

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:39.649
the analogical position put
forth by Aquinas,

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:42.641
for instance,
that we really talk about God

00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:46.490
analogically and know the
qualities we attribute to God

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.980
only they're not real by what we
may know in our own lives.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.295
Dante asks this question about
what is the language of God?

00:07:54.295 --> 00:07:57.610
What are the names of God and
how do we get to know God?

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.009
The first virtue then is the
virtue of faith.

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:04.947
There are many ways
literally--I call it a basic

00:08:04.947 --> 00:08:08.759
word because it's really a basic
word because it founds us.

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:13.201
It's a stone,
Peter asks for the foundation

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:19.230
of all this poetic edifice of
the Divine Comedy.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.589
I would like you to think about
this--

00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:24.139
the actual--when we get into
the text,

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:31.600
there is actual apostrophe at
the beginning of Canto XXIV of,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.962
"'O fellowship elect to
the great supper of the blessed

00:08:34.962 --> 00:08:36.856
Lamb,
who feeds you so that your

00:08:36.856 --> 00:08:39.975
desire is ever satisfied,
since by God's grace this man

00:08:39.975 --> 00:08:42.889
has foretaste of that which
falls from your table,

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:47.346
before death appoints his time,
give heed to his measureless

00:08:47.346 --> 00:08:50.370
craving and bedew him with some
drops;

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.464
you drink always from the
fountain whence comes that on

00:08:53.464 --> 00:08:56.330
which his mind is set.'"
He wants to know--

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.519
what I do--what I would like to
stress is the presence of this

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:02.649
actual metaphor of a banquet.
 

00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:09.144
It is as if Dante is--clearly
we're dealing with two metaphors

00:09:09.144 --> 00:09:11.447
here;
one which is exilic,

00:09:11.447 --> 00:09:17.243
the manna in the desert,
the falling of this dew on the

00:09:17.243 --> 00:09:19.274
exiles,
the wanderers,

00:09:19.274 --> 00:09:22.090
the Jewish wanderers in the
desert,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.450
and the other one is the
eschatological banquet.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:31.636
It is as if any debate about
faith has to be placed within a

00:09:31.636 --> 00:09:33.629
communal context.
 

00:09:33.629 --> 00:09:37.922
This is not going to be the
professional faith the way you

00:09:37.922 --> 00:09:41.009
may have it, let's say in 1550
roughly.

00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:47.639
I'm really alluding to,
as a contrast,

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:49.298
just to make you understand the
case,

00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:54.573
the great debate between two
figures of the Renaissance

00:09:54.573 --> 00:09:57.308
called Erasmus and Luther.
 

00:09:57.308 --> 00:10:00.317
They debated,
at length, about the question

00:10:00.317 --> 00:10:04.899
of whether or not how a text
written about a century earlier,

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:07.340
around 1440,
a text by Valla,

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.874
a great humanist who wrote
about the free will in the

00:10:11.874 --> 00:10:15.710
defense of the free will-- on
free will.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.253
He--they were--it was unclear
to them what Valla really meant

00:10:19.253 --> 00:10:22.388
so they go on debating;
the text in called On Free

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:22.960
Will.
 

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.080
Erasmus maintains that Valla
really had defended the

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.100
existence of free will.
 

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.908
Free will, which is a gift of
God, it's something that has

00:10:33.908 --> 00:10:38.970
been given to us and therefore
we really have to come to know

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:43.947
God through the acknowledgement
of his authority because the

00:10:43.947 --> 00:10:47.966
freedom that we are talking--
that he is talking about,

00:10:47.966 --> 00:10:49.460
he thinks Valla is talking
about,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.712
actually comes from him,
and so by the free will we come

00:10:52.712 --> 00:10:56.500
to know and come to choose also
the existence of the divinity.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:02.820
Luther had very radical ideas
about the question of freedom.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:09.918
There was not such a thing he
would argue as free will,

00:11:09.918 --> 00:11:14.346
and actually the world,
the universe is a universe of

00:11:14.346 --> 00:11:18.053
absolute faith,
and faith is freedom and it's

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:22.028
given to us by freedom because
it releases us from all

00:11:22.028 --> 00:11:25.274
obligations,
it frees us from all

00:11:25.274 --> 00:11:30.590
constraints, it just makes us
understand that our own

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:36.724
relationship to the Creator is
without any other intermediary

00:11:36.724 --> 00:11:39.279
forces of the world.
 

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:43.083
It's a radical,
theological claim of freedom,

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:44.899
and faith together.
 

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:46.568
It's very possible;
many people,

00:11:46.568 --> 00:11:50.399
just to extend this argument,
there are many poets and

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:54.750
thinkers who go on changing his
scenario and believe that,

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.794
for instance,
freedom is actually the source

00:11:58.794 --> 00:12:01.899
of not faith but faithlessness.
 

00:12:01.899 --> 00:12:06.080
That the idea of--one's own
faithlessness may come,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.326
as a denial of God,
may come from the assertion of

00:12:09.326 --> 00:12:13.168
one's self and the assertion of
one's own total freedom.

00:12:13.168 --> 00:12:16.615
But this is--I'm giving you
this to exemplify the nature of

00:12:16.615 --> 00:12:19.168
the debates and the force of the
debates.

00:12:19.168 --> 00:12:23.768
Dante insists--so removes the
question of faith from one of

00:12:23.768 --> 00:12:27.019
radical subjectivity or radical
faith,

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:32.798
aware that there may be some
kind--some flip side to it,

00:12:32.798 --> 00:12:37.058
that faith and lack of faith
really both depend,

00:12:37.058 --> 00:12:39.149
if you reduce them to
subjectivity,

00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:45.639
one can go on sliding into one
of the two options very easily.

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:47.827
Dante focuses on,
with this first image,

00:12:47.827 --> 00:12:51.080
on the question of the communal
experience, the banquet.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.759
That to me is part of the
shared world,

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:57.029
this eschatological banquet,
where they're all the--

00:12:57.029 --> 00:12:59.288
the vision where,
at the end of time,

00:12:59.288 --> 00:13:05.629
but the allusion is also to the
manna where these various

00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:09.553
figures are--
the community comes together

00:13:09.553 --> 00:13:14.899
and then Dante goes on really
focusing on the individuality,

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:19.009
on the private professional
faith, it's really about him.

00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:23.691
The interesting thing that I
want to point out is Beatrice's

00:13:23.691 --> 00:13:27.092
words to Peter,
around lines 30,

00:13:27.092 --> 00:13:33.629
she goes on appealing to him to
go on to examining,

00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:36.928
but she does so in a peculiar
way.

00:13:36.928 --> 00:13:39.211
Let me read this passage,
"And she,"

00:13:39.211 --> 00:13:41.934
lines 32,
"'O eternal light of the

00:13:41.934 --> 00:13:45.509
great soul with whom our Lord
left the keys,"

00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:49.783
this is very canonical,
it's part of the hagiography,

00:13:49.783 --> 00:13:54.787
the account of the iconographic
representation of Peter with the

00:13:54.787 --> 00:13:58.244
two keys,
"which He brought down of

00:13:58.244 --> 00:14:02.313
this wondrous joy,
test this man on points light

00:14:02.313 --> 00:14:07.052
and grave as thou seest good
regarding the faith by which

00:14:07.052 --> 00:14:09.928
thou walkedst on the sea."
 

00:14:09.928 --> 00:14:14.562
This is an allusion recorded in
the Gospel of Peter walking out

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:17.251
of an act of faith,
walking on water,

00:14:17.251 --> 00:14:20.538
because Jesus asks him and
tells him so.

00:14:20.538 --> 00:14:26.346
The strange thing about this
reference is that Peter did not

00:14:26.346 --> 00:14:28.710
want to walk on water.
 

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:33.190
It is the moment of,
let me call it the crisis of

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.447
faith,
the moment where Peter had no

00:14:36.447 --> 00:14:39.450
faith and in fact Jesus calls
him,

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.067
"Oh man of little faith
why don't you walk,"

00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:47.094
and then I guess feeling that
he's teetering on the brink of

00:14:47.094 --> 00:14:51.293
the abyss you can imagine,
really see soaring over the

00:14:51.293 --> 00:14:54.149
waves, finally does manage to go
on.

00:14:54.149 --> 00:14:58.201
This is a poignant moment
because clearly Dante's

00:14:58.201 --> 00:15:02.844
emphasizing that there are
degrees of faith and that the

00:15:02.844 --> 00:15:08.500
so-called crisis of faith must
not be seen as denials of faith.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.044
On the contrary,
that somehow there is a sort of

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:16.570
dialectical movement between a
profession of faith and doubts

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:20.922
about owning and that's the--
owning this gift,

00:15:20.922 --> 00:15:24.210
of having this gift of faith.
 

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.913
This is one of the strange
moments and it's in the light of

00:15:28.913 --> 00:15:33.698
this strange fluctuation between
faith and experience of not

00:15:33.698 --> 00:15:38.158
faith that I think that what
happens later has to--

00:15:38.158 --> 00:15:41.995
the wait has to be understood,
and then whether he loves

00:15:41.995 --> 00:15:44.806
rightly and rightly hopes,
and believes,

00:15:44.806 --> 00:15:47.470
here are the three--three of
the language--

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.960
the three theological virtues
all come together.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.596
"Is not hid from thee,
since thou hast seen it

00:15:53.596 --> 00:15:57.578
there," and so on and then
Dante uses both the language of

00:15:57.578 --> 00:16:00.005
the university,
academic life,

00:16:00.005 --> 00:16:03.538
as if this were really an
academic test.

00:16:03.538 --> 00:16:06.690
We'll come back to this issue
in a moment.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:11.018
Just as the bachelor--that's
the--the Bachelor of Arts,

00:16:11.018 --> 00:16:15.427
the baccalaureatus,
as we call it arms himself so

00:16:15.427 --> 00:16:16.870
there are two.
 

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.700
There is the weapon of
knowledge, the academic,

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.850
knowledge as a force,
knowledge as a weapon,

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.474
"just as the bachelor arms
himself and does not speak to

00:16:27.474 --> 00:16:29.710
the master,"
magister,

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.873
"submits the question--
for argument,

00:16:31.873 --> 00:16:34.120
not for settlement."
 

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:40.504
These issues are issues that
always need the open-endedness

00:16:40.504 --> 00:16:47.000
of argumentation and not that of
a settling of the point.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.860
"I armed myself with all
my reasons while she was

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.940
speaking, to be ready for such a
questioner and for such a

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.750
profession.
 

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.889
'Speak, good Christian,
declare thyself.'"

00:16:57.889 --> 00:17:03.778
This is a knowledge that makes
him visible,

00:17:03.778 --> 00:17:06.696
"declare thyself,"
but a knowledge that does not

00:17:06.696 --> 00:17:09.326
keep him hidden,
sort of brings him into

00:17:09.326 --> 00:17:11.920
existence, makes him visible to
us.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.613
What is faith and that's the
question that he--that Peter

00:17:16.613 --> 00:17:17.200
asks.
 

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.058
And the answer is,
"'May the grace which

00:17:21.058 --> 00:17:25.356
grants it to me to make my
confession to the Chief

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:29.106
Centurion,' I began,
'give me right utterance for my

00:17:29.106 --> 00:17:29.660
thoughts.'
 

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.593
And I went on:
'As the truthful pen,'"

00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:36.023
an allusionist to Paul,
a questioning an authority,

00:17:36.023 --> 00:17:38.733
and the word authority,
as you know,

00:17:38.733 --> 00:17:43.692
is that which is--what do we
mean by authentic and

00:17:43.692 --> 00:17:48.430
authorities are key words,
the word is auctoritas.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:53.818
It means that comes which is
worthy of faith.

00:17:53.818 --> 00:17:58.598
The teacher is not necessarily
worthy of faith.

00:17:58.598 --> 00:18:02.027
You can question the opinions
of the teacher and reject the

00:18:02.027 --> 00:18:05.336
question of the--there's a
distinction between the master

00:18:05.336 --> 00:18:06.460
and the author.
 

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.219
The one--or the authority,
the one who is an author is one

00:18:10.219 --> 00:18:13.203
who is worthy of belief,
worthy of faith,

00:18:13.203 --> 00:18:16.327
so he quotes Paul,
so this is a canonical answer,

00:18:16.327 --> 00:18:19.134
"'As the truthful pen of
thy dear brother,"

00:18:19.134 --> 00:18:21.442
Paul,
"wrote of it with thee,

00:18:21.442 --> 00:18:24.435
father, put Rome on the good
path, faith is the

00:18:24.435 --> 00:18:27.430
substance,"
literally the foundation,

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:30.088
that which lies under all the
things.

00:18:30.088 --> 00:18:33.980
The ground of all things,
substance of things hoped for,

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.392
so faith--if you want to
understand faith we ought to

00:18:37.392 --> 00:18:41.685
probably go and read about hope,
things hoped for and the

00:18:41.685 --> 00:18:44.098
evidence of things not seen.
 

00:18:44.098 --> 00:18:49.221
This I take to be its quiddity,
quiddity and medieval--part of

00:18:49.221 --> 00:18:53.670
the medieval lexicon meaning its
constitutive essence,

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.348
its specificity.
 

00:18:55.348 --> 00:18:59.781
Now if you thought that in the
Middle Ages that we'll go on

00:18:59.781 --> 00:19:03.913
talking about faith,
the famous formulation of faith

00:19:03.913 --> 00:19:09.490
comes from Tertullian who says,
"I believe because it is

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:13.490
absurd,"
so that faith becomes the

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.894
consequence of,
the extension of,

00:19:16.894 --> 00:19:19.288
the absurdity of all things.
 

00:19:19.288 --> 00:19:23.920
Because the claim made on what
one believes has in itself the

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.165
idea of going--being beyond
reason, absurd in that sense

00:19:28.165 --> 00:19:30.250
would be beyond reason.
 

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:35.680
That's one of the ways in which
faith is defined.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.380
It really means that faith
exceeds the law of reason;

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.038
it means that faith can never
really quite be an object of

00:19:43.038 --> 00:19:43.809
knowledge.
 

00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:46.808
Dante does not pursue that line.
 

00:19:46.808 --> 00:19:51.338
He tries to make faith a reason
co-extensive.

00:19:51.338 --> 00:19:55.425
This is the sense of the--I've
got to qualify the term

00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:58.232
co-extensive,
and I will in a moment,

00:19:58.232 --> 00:20:02.453
because obviously they are not,
but they are--they belong

00:20:02.453 --> 00:20:03.240
together.
 

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.969
This is the sense of the whole
metaphorical pattern of the

00:20:08.969 --> 00:20:11.078
university context.
 

00:20:11.078 --> 00:20:15.298
That is to say,
you can know something about

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:20.205
belief, knowledge and faith
really belong together,

00:20:20.205 --> 00:20:23.150
they implicate each other.
 

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.343
They are not the same thing
because if you really could know

00:20:26.343 --> 00:20:29.590
everything of what you belief
then there is no reason why you

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.865
should belief,
that which faith becomes

00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:35.875
necessary--
a necessity only because they

00:20:35.875 --> 00:20:38.930
are-- it's a way of
acknowledging limitations of

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.098
what one knows.
 

00:20:40.098 --> 00:20:44.054
But linking knowledge and faith
is not just simply a way of

00:20:44.054 --> 00:20:48.144
saying that reason can know some
of the content of what Dante

00:20:48.144 --> 00:20:50.568
believes,
that there is a reasonableness

00:20:50.568 --> 00:20:52.480
to what one believes,
that's all true.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.564
To say that reason and faith go
together, there are certain

00:20:55.564 --> 00:20:58.490
claims about the reasonableness
of what one believes.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:03.015
It really means,
I think, at a deeper level,

00:21:03.015 --> 00:21:07.538
that faith itself is a mode of
knowledge.

00:21:07.538 --> 00:21:10.530
That it is a mode of knowledge
exactly the way you have the

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.625
knowledge of philosophy though
its modalities are going to be

00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:17.217
different,
because philosophy submits to

00:21:17.217 --> 00:21:22.386
the rules of the rationality,
but faith opens your eyes and

00:21:22.386 --> 00:21:26.478
it's a way of showing you
something about the world that

00:21:26.478 --> 00:21:28.710
the reason alone cannot do.
 

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.909
The binding of the two
metaphors, that's what I meant

00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:33.940
co-extensive but not identical.
 

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.840
I didn't mean they're identical;
the joining of philosophy and

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:43.114
theology, reason and faith,
makes and projects faith as a

00:21:43.114 --> 00:21:44.808
way of knowing.
 

00:21:44.808 --> 00:21:51.564
It makes you see the world in
different ways then if you were

00:21:51.564 --> 00:21:58.431
trying to look at the world in
the light of natural reason and

00:21:58.431 --> 00:22:03.160
from the point of view of
rationality.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:08.210
So this seems to be the
argument and I set the terms

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:11.980
against,
let's say, a modern subjective

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.959
idea of freedom,
freedom of faith as freedom,

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:21.046
that frees you from all,
and you are only accountable to

00:22:21.046 --> 00:22:24.663
the Creator,
or faith as a mode of

00:22:24.663 --> 00:22:29.618
responding to the absurdity
around oneself,

00:22:29.618 --> 00:22:34.279
which is really the language of
Tertullian and this scholastic

00:22:34.279 --> 00:22:39.336
argument that Aquinas,
of knowledge and faith really

00:22:39.336 --> 00:22:41.940
needing to be together.
 

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.920
Then the examination goes on
and I want to talk about 70,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.660
"'Thou thinkest
right," this is the

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.790
beginning,
the top of the page Canto XXIV,

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.930
line 68,
"Then I heard:

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:59.465
'Thou thinkest rightly if thou
understandest well why he placed

00:22:59.465 --> 00:23:03.710
it among the substances and
after among the evidences.'

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:07.882
And I then: 'The deep things
that so richly manifest

00:23:07.882 --> 00:23:12.463
themselves to me here are so
hidden from men's eyes below

00:23:12.463 --> 00:23:17.210
that there their existence lies
in belief alone."

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:21.402
Now, it's the distinction,
this is a cesura between belief

00:23:21.402 --> 00:23:24.971
and what we are--
the evidence of things not

00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:29.817
seen, the paradox remains,
so there are things visible

00:23:29.817 --> 00:23:35.667
here in the heaven of the fixed
stars and not available to those

00:23:35.667 --> 00:23:40.220
of us who are in time and in the
fallen world.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.450
"On which is based the
lofty hope;

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.288
and therefore it takes the
character of substance.

00:23:45.288 --> 00:23:47.730
And from this belief we must
reason, without seeing more;

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.890
therefore it holds the
character of evidence."

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:55.640
This is a gloss on the medieval
theological lexicon that Dante

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.618
has been deploying.
 

00:23:57.618 --> 00:24:00.809
"Then I heard:
'If all that is acquired below

00:24:00.809 --> 00:24:04.131
for doctrine were thus
understood, there would be no

00:24:04.131 --> 00:24:06.278
room left for sophist's wit.'
 

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:09.868
This breathed from the kindled
love;

00:24:09.868 --> 00:24:12.679
and it continued,"
I want you to pay attention to

00:24:12.679 --> 00:24:15.305
this metaphor,
for I wish you had--we're

00:24:15.305 --> 00:24:19.102
really sitting around the table
where I could ask you to

00:24:19.102 --> 00:24:22.900
speculate about the presence of
the coming metaphor.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.728
"If all that is acquired
below for doctrine,"

00:24:26.728 --> 00:24:27.650
I am sorry.
 

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:34.867
"'Now the alloy and the
weight of this money have been

00:24:34.867 --> 00:24:39.294
well examined;
but tell me if thou hast it in

00:24:39.294 --> 00:24:43.188
thy purse.'"
All of a sudden the question of

00:24:43.188 --> 00:24:46.108
money and the question of
faith--

00:24:46.108 --> 00:24:55.038
faith is literally given as
said to be money.

00:24:55.038 --> 00:24:59.670
Do you have this coin in your
purse?

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.891
"I therefore:
'I have indeed,

00:25:02.891 --> 00:25:08.750
so bright and round that of its
mintage I am in no doubt.'

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:13.201
Then there came from the depth
of the light that was shining

00:25:13.201 --> 00:25:15.767
there: 'This precious
jewel,'"

00:25:15.767 --> 00:25:20.369
that's one reason why the
metaphor of money is used for--

00:25:20.369 --> 00:25:22.730
clearly for faith.
 

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.932
It's a precious jewel on which
every virtue rests,

00:25:26.932 --> 00:25:30.450
"whence did it come to
thee?"

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.209
And the language is going to
be--it's from the plenteous

00:25:33.209 --> 00:25:36.269
reign of the Holy Spirit and the
new parchments and so on,

00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:41.375
but that metaphor of money as
faith really sort of has a way

00:25:41.375 --> 00:25:44.059
of lingering on in our minds.
 

00:25:44.059 --> 00:25:45.690
What is the connection?
 

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.282
One connection,
I repeat, is to indicate the

00:25:49.282 --> 00:25:52.460
preciousness of the faith one
holds.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:58.472
It is really as rare maybe and
it's valuable as rare,

00:25:58.472 --> 00:26:01.480
beautiful jewels can be.
 

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.000
That's one thing,
but clearly there is more,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.910
because the word money which
Dante uses in Italian,

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.593
moneta,
is the same word becomes a

00:26:10.593 --> 00:26:15.171
character in an English epic,
moneta comes from the

00:26:15.171 --> 00:26:18.990
Latin form meneo,
the word money as you know

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:23.051
comes from--
meaning a warning,

00:26:23.051 --> 00:26:29.068
it's an advice,
it's a warning,

00:26:29.068 --> 00:26:35.088
a warning about its mintage,
it's part of the language of--

00:26:35.088 --> 00:26:38.588
we have the word admonishment
that comes from it.

00:26:38.588 --> 00:26:40.750
It admonishes that it's not a
counterfeit,

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.156
that it is really pure,
so that's another way of

00:26:44.156 --> 00:26:47.130
referring to the purity of this
faith,

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.009
the preciousness before,
now the purity of this faith,

00:26:50.009 --> 00:26:53.118
the authenticity of it so to
speak.

00:26:53.118 --> 00:26:56.710
Another trait of money is that
money has--

00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:01.368
it's that which establishes the
value--

00:27:01.368 --> 00:27:05.038
it circulates first of all,
has the power of circulating,

00:27:05.038 --> 00:27:10.019
that's not said by the text but
it's implied by the metaphor.

00:27:10.019 --> 00:27:15.095
It is as if faith has that
power, has that virtue that puts

00:27:15.095 --> 00:27:19.278
everything into motion,
and therefore questions and

00:27:19.278 --> 00:27:21.661
establishes,
that's what makes it a basic

00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:21.960
word.
 

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.996
It establishes,
it's the substance that

00:27:24.996 --> 00:27:29.950
establishes the values of all
the things that are around us.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:34.217
Fourth, I cannot really get
past my mind that Dante wants us

00:27:34.217 --> 00:27:38.630
to think about this kind of the
resonance of prophenation that

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:43.114
is in the language of money and
link it with really this purity

00:27:43.114 --> 00:27:44.200
of faith.
 

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.714
It is as if there is--the
distinction is really never

00:27:47.714 --> 00:27:51.636
quite between prophenation and
the purity of faith and that

00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:55.085
somehow the world of faith comes
out of the world of

00:27:55.085 --> 00:27:56.368
prophenation.
 

00:27:56.368 --> 00:28:01.313
That it belongs to the world of
time, it can be profane and yet

00:28:01.313 --> 00:28:05.298
it still manages to put things
into circulation.

00:28:05.298 --> 00:28:08.130
It's really the ambiguity of
money, the ambiguity of the

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:12.469
metaphor of money;
I think sheds a lot of light on

00:28:12.469 --> 00:28:17.058
this virtue that Dante has been
examining.

00:28:17.058 --> 00:28:21.045
He has been examined about it
but he has been--he is examining

00:28:21.045 --> 00:28:21.828
it for us.
 

00:28:21.828 --> 00:28:26.461
Let me go and see how--whether
we can see more about this

00:28:26.461 --> 00:28:30.678
virtue by looking at the
question of hope that comes

00:28:30.678 --> 00:28:34.317
immediately after with the
examination by St.

00:28:34.317 --> 00:28:35.308
James.
 

00:28:35.308 --> 00:28:40.058
I begin to tell you here just a
little story that--

00:28:40.058 --> 00:28:44.140
it's not really an unusual
story, but as you probably know,

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:51.578
the Greeks never thought of
hope as a virtue.

00:28:51.578 --> 00:28:59.375
There's a reference to hope
in--as being one of

00:28:59.375 --> 00:29:09.203
Pandora's--being one of the
entities available in Pandora's

00:29:09.203 --> 00:29:10.558
Box.
 

00:29:10.558 --> 00:29:15.726
You know about Pandora's Box,
which was opened and all the

00:29:15.726 --> 00:29:19.714
evils of the world came out of
Pandora's Box,

00:29:19.714 --> 00:29:21.798
save for one,
hope.

00:29:21.798 --> 00:29:25.470
It's a statement,
it's a view that all is--

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:30.238
that really casts hope as
clearly, some kind of evil or a

00:29:30.238 --> 00:29:32.460
delusion,
and in fact,

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:38.460
for the Greeks the idea of hope
is always a term that implies

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.058
the delusion of exiles.
 

00:29:41.058 --> 00:29:46.387
It's really what befalls an
exile, someone who loses one's

00:29:46.387 --> 00:29:51.529
land and what is left for him to
do nothing but hope.

00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:55.608
It's the radical illusion;
it's a kind of hope against

00:29:55.608 --> 00:29:56.029
hope.
 

00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:58.827
I have nothing more to do;
it's a self-deception,

00:29:58.827 --> 00:30:00.470
that's really what it is.
 

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:05.660
Dante does not follow that
route for hope,

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.057
and in effect,
I think that he finds in the

00:30:09.057 --> 00:30:14.587
Bible the idea that--
or a kind of a new--a different

00:30:14.587 --> 00:30:20.943
horizon for the rethinking,
the way in which hope can be

00:30:20.943 --> 00:30:21.778
viewed.
 

00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:26.160
Hope, first of all,
is literally a virtue of time.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:31.205
More so faith--the language of
the clock, you must have noticed

00:30:31.205 --> 00:30:34.950
in Canto XXIV introducing the
world of hope.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.020
I did not want to talk about it
because I know that I'll be

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.240
talking about it now.
 

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.509
Hope is as much of faith a
virtue of time,

00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:45.779
because it's a virtue not only
of time;

00:30:45.779 --> 00:30:48.710
it's a virtue specifically of
the future.

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:54.175
It tells me whenever--if I have
hope--I can't really hope about

00:30:54.175 --> 00:30:58.849
the past, it would be--it would
fly against all sense,

00:30:58.849 --> 00:31:00.789
against all logic.
 

00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:04.910
I hope yesterday it didn't rain;
it doesn't make sense does it?

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:08.368
I mean it's--but I can hope
that tomorrow it won't snow.

00:31:08.368 --> 00:31:11.659
I can have that hope which
would be a silly hope,

00:31:11.659 --> 00:31:15.701
but it's a hope nonetheless
because it's a virtue of time in

00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:16.730
the future.
 

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:20.101
It's a way of experiencing time
in the future,

00:31:20.101 --> 00:31:24.520
that's one thing that Dante is
doing, linking therefore hope

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.019
and temporality.
 

00:31:26.019 --> 00:31:28.088
But it's not only a virtue of
time;

00:31:28.088 --> 00:31:30.730
it's the most realistic of
virtues.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.734
Normally, we think,
and the Greeks would sort of

00:31:33.734 --> 00:31:37.124
give us a cause to pause,
that if you really hope it's

00:31:37.124 --> 00:31:39.490
because you are really
desperate.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:45.180
You hope because they have no
rational reason,

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:49.673
no realistic reason to believe
that things are going to go the

00:31:49.673 --> 00:31:53.808
way you wish they went for you,
so you go on hoping.

00:31:53.808 --> 00:31:57.874
Dante says no,
hope is the most realistic of

00:31:57.874 --> 00:32:03.829
virtues because it tells me that
nothing is really ever over.

00:32:03.829 --> 00:32:05.640
That's what makes it realistic.
 

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:10.190
The negation of hope,
the opposite of hope would be

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.098
despair.
 

00:32:11.098 --> 00:32:14.910
Dante, you remember,
is the scene for Dante,

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:17.680
is the scene that we find in
canto--

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.010
we never read it,
and now retrospectively I can

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.190
tell you that you should go and
read it,

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.690
Canto VIII of Inferno,
and even in Canto IX,

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.259
the encounter with the Medusa
is that fear of despair,

00:32:29.259 --> 00:32:30.740
that idea of being petrified.
 

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.660
The Medusa can turn you into a
stone;

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.909
that is to say,
that you are imprisoned and you

00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:41.146
remain caught either in your
standpoint or in that particular

00:32:41.146 --> 00:32:45.103
reality that you have or the
idea of yourself as you like

00:32:45.103 --> 00:32:47.613
to--
as you think you have been,

00:32:47.613 --> 00:32:49.348
and the idea of the past.
 

00:32:49.348 --> 00:32:52.029
Dante says, no hope is a virtue
of the future;

00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:55.380
it's a virtue that can even
change the past.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.111
In that sense,
it's effective on the past,

00:32:58.111 --> 00:33:02.173
though it's--because it tells
us that the past may not be what

00:33:02.173 --> 00:33:03.640
we thought it was.
 

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.410
Whatever disaster you may have
had,

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:09.269
whatever disappointment you may
have had in the past,

00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:13.946
that disappointment may contain
seeds that really will reappear

00:33:13.946 --> 00:33:17.585
in the future,
and maybe a preparing a future

00:33:17.585 --> 00:33:19.470
that will surprise you.
 

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:24.240
This is a different
understanding of time that Dante

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.269
presents.
 

00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:29.825
It's an understanding of time
that once again Dante links with

00:33:29.825 --> 00:33:34.146
two moments of his which is--
in that sense it's really not

00:33:34.146 --> 00:33:36.875
different from faith,
it fulfills faith,

00:33:36.875 --> 00:33:38.960
it unveils the element of
faith.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:44.232
You cannot really go on hoping
about something like that unless

00:33:44.232 --> 00:33:47.038
you have some--an act of faith.
 

00:33:47.038 --> 00:33:51.545
Dante goes on explaining it in
existential terms and tying it

00:33:51.545 --> 00:33:55.150
to his own hope of returning to
his homeland,

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:59.123
his own native city,
and the larger pattern of

00:33:59.123 --> 00:33:59.829
exile.
 

00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:02.068
I want to examine that with you.
 

00:34:02.068 --> 00:34:06.308
The poem begins with a
subjunctive;

00:34:06.308 --> 00:34:09.641
Canto XXV begins with an
optative, what we call,

00:34:09.641 --> 00:34:12.831
"I wish"
that things were going that

00:34:12.831 --> 00:34:13.400
way.
 

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:20.750
"If it ever come to
pass," contingency,

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.268
the word is contingency in
Italian,

00:34:22.268 --> 00:34:25.800
it uses the Latinism because we
don't really use that in that

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.458
sense,
but I'll read in Italian even

00:34:29.458 --> 00:34:33.518
if Margaret--
I wish she were here se mai

00:34:33.518 --> 00:34:36.626
contingua,
that's a Latinism,

00:34:36.626 --> 00:34:40.047
if ever I were to--
contingent, if it ever happened

00:34:40.047 --> 00:34:41.994
in that sense,
"that the sacred

00:34:41.994 --> 00:34:44.365
poem," "poema
sacro,"

00:34:44.365 --> 00:34:47.244
"if it ever come to pass
the sacred poem,"

00:34:47.244 --> 00:34:50.822
and the sacred means--
remember that Dante uses the

00:34:50.822 --> 00:34:54.489
word "sacred"
always in a double sense.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:59.059
A sacred, he's not investigate
with some kind of magic,

00:34:59.059 --> 00:35:02.775
idolatress power because for
Dante the sacred is never

00:35:02.775 --> 00:35:06.137
reducible or localizable,
that's a verb,

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:10.329
in one object or in one
particular place.

00:35:10.329 --> 00:35:14.047
He means it ambiguously as that
which contains the profane and

00:35:14.047 --> 00:35:16.302
the sacred within it,
hell and heaven,

00:35:16.302 --> 00:35:18.619
the scriptures of heaven and
hell.

00:35:18.619 --> 00:35:22.309
"The sacred poem to which
both heaven and earth have set

00:35:22.309 --> 00:35:25.076
their hand,"
it's an incredible moment of

00:35:25.076 --> 00:35:26.860
prophetic self-awareness.
 

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:31.434
I am writing but I know that
without God I would not be able

00:35:31.434 --> 00:35:35.490
to be writing this poem,
"that it has made me lean

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.780
for many years,"
writing now.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:42.407
I'm sorry that I'm giving you
this kind of simple paraphrase

00:35:42.407 --> 00:35:46.641
of it, but the ascesis of
writing, writing is a--do you

00:35:46.641 --> 00:35:48.760
understand what I mean?
 

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:52.210
Writing is an ascetic labor of
the soul,

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:57.969
it makes me lean as if he were
undergoing fasting,

00:35:57.969 --> 00:36:05.320
the rituals of the commitment
to a particular labor,

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.320
so I call it the ascetic labor
of the soul;

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.324
"should overcome the
cruelty that bars me from the

00:36:12.324 --> 00:36:14.030
fair sheepfold."
 

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:18.255
If I could ever go back home,
but he called back home

00:36:18.255 --> 00:36:22.320
Florence, in the canto of hope
where he's an exile,

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.139
and the city is described in
passive terms.

00:36:26.139 --> 00:36:30.409
The metaphor of the city as a
sheepfold,

00:36:30.409 --> 00:36:33.458
the Passover language,
the language you expect to have

00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:35.530
in the Eclogues of
Virgil,

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.250
the pastoral tradition.
 

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.079
The idyllic world,
that's what we mean by the

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:41.429
pastoral tradition.
 

00:36:41.429 --> 00:36:47.297
If there ever were some peace,
some idyllic circumstances in

00:36:47.297 --> 00:36:49.815
that city,
and you can continue,

00:36:49.815 --> 00:36:52.909
"where I slept as a
lamb," here he continues

00:36:52.909 --> 00:36:56.315
with the pastoral language,
"an enemy to the wolves

00:36:56.315 --> 00:36:59.208
that make war on it,
with another voice now,

00:36:59.208 --> 00:37:02.130
and other fleece I shall return
a poet,

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:05.400
and to the font of my baptism
take the laurel crown;

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.338
for there I entered into the
faith that makes souls known to

00:37:09.338 --> 00:37:11.275
God, and after,
because of it,

00:37:11.275 --> 00:37:13.880
Peter thus encircled my
brow."

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:19.159
Dante is still in the circle of
hope and the heaven of hope,

00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:23.090
and yet now he's really
thinking about the last ceremony

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:26.380
of Peter on him who blesses him
three times.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:31.146
It is as if literally faith,
and hope are now converging,

00:37:31.146 --> 00:37:33.869
the two virtues come together.
 

00:37:33.869 --> 00:37:37.490
What is Dante saying though
here in this proem,

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:40.090
at the beginning of this canto?
 

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:45.262
He's casting his hometown
Florence in the pastoral

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:48.110
language,
as a sheepfold,

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:54.010
and they know he's alluding to
a Messianic time where--

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:57.619
when if it were just--when the
peace were restored,

00:37:57.619 --> 00:38:01.340
when the factions,
the wolves, the Guelfs,

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.695
the pun of wolves and Guelfs,
that's very clear that's what

00:38:04.695 --> 00:38:07.300
etymologically the word Guelfs
comes from,

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.340
from wolves and the lambs will
lie together,

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:14.150
almost a kind of impossible
time, a Messianic time,

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.960
when finally peace will be
restored.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.760
He goes on adding that he would
be acknowledged,

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.599
that's part of his hope,
he will be acknowledged,

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:27.675
there will be--at that time he
would acknowledged as a poet on

00:38:27.675 --> 00:38:31.347
the font of his baptism,
which as you know he refers to

00:38:31.347 --> 00:38:32.653
the Baptistery of St.
 

00:38:32.653 --> 00:38:36.699
John, where we do have records
that he actually was christened.

00:38:36.699 --> 00:38:41.181
That's simple language,
but you have to ask yourselves,

00:38:41.181 --> 00:38:43.090
why would Dante talk?
 

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.389
Why would he use this
particular metaphor?

00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:49.097
The baptism is clearly the
place where a community is

00:38:49.097 --> 00:38:52.949
constituted, then the baptismal
font has that value.

00:38:52.949 --> 00:38:55.266
Not only has that value,
it's actually the same

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:58.585
baptismal font that Dante had--
you remember there had been a

00:38:58.585 --> 00:39:02.929
prophenation of it in canto--
described in Canto XIX of

00:39:02.929 --> 00:39:08.612
Hell where Dante says
that he broke one of those

00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:11.646
Guelfs,
which we try to understand in

00:39:11.646 --> 00:39:15.402
figurative terms since it would
be inconceivable that Dante

00:39:15.402 --> 00:39:17.670
would be capable of breaking it.
 

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.820
He says he began to rescue
someone who was dying.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.340
What is a baptismal font?
 

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:26.846
For those of you who have no
inkling of what this is it's

00:39:26.846 --> 00:39:29.538
the--
what we call the sacramental,

00:39:29.538 --> 00:39:34.297
the typological,
if you really--more textual and

00:39:34.297 --> 00:39:39.266
historical about that sacrament,
that ceremony,

00:39:39.266 --> 00:39:41.320
re-enactment of Exodus.
 

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:46.106
When a child is baptized,
he is literally said--he's told

00:39:46.106 --> 00:39:50.978
actually that he is once again
re-enacting the crossing of

00:39:50.978 --> 00:39:51.920
Exodus.
 

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.846
To me this is extraordinary,
that Dante says that he would

00:39:56.846 --> 00:40:02.117
be now acknowledged and be given
the laurel of the poet on the

00:40:02.117 --> 00:40:03.760
baptismal font.
 

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.920
The question you have to ask
yourselves is,

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:10.155
no doubt, is,
Dante's asking how does a poet

00:40:10.155 --> 00:40:11.210
come home?
 

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:14.581
He imagines a triumph at the
baptismal font,

00:40:14.581 --> 00:40:18.579
is there a home--what is the
homecoming of poets?

00:40:18.579 --> 00:40:20.885
That's the hope,
hope for a homecoming where

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:23.889
everybody will be at peace and
there will be a feast,

00:40:23.889 --> 00:40:27.525
a festive mood and he was going
to be welcomed back and he would

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:29.659
hailed and acknowledged as a
poet,

00:40:29.659 --> 00:40:34.670
a great fantasy of every--of
the winner's return.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:37.480
That's literally what he is
saying.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.355
Yet, he's using this language
of a baptismal font which is the

00:40:41.355 --> 00:40:42.690
language of Exodus.
 

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:46.233
It is as if he were saying that
the poet can only come home in

00:40:46.233 --> 00:40:49.659
order to tell his community that
I have to get out again.

00:40:49.659 --> 00:40:53.414
That all of them will have to
do exactly what's happening to

00:40:53.414 --> 00:40:55.253
him,
that the exile that has

00:40:55.253 --> 00:40:57.679
been--with which he has been
punished,

00:40:57.679 --> 00:41:01.045
and which has befallen him,
is really the message that his

00:41:01.045 --> 00:41:04.530
poetry can only give to the
community from which he has been

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:05.179
exiled.
 

00:41:05.179 --> 00:41:09.456
He is convoking the whole
community around the baptismal

00:41:09.456 --> 00:41:11.719
font,
which is the figure of exile,

00:41:11.719 --> 00:41:14.380
to tell them this is really
where we belong --

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:19.018
in exile, in the language of
spiritual exile,

00:41:19.018 --> 00:41:25.297
a language in which clearly
implies some kind of re-making

00:41:25.297 --> 00:41:28.280
of oneself,
re-thinking of oneself.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:32.994
Now, with this in mind,
Dante goes on seeing the barren

00:41:32.994 --> 00:41:37.184
for whom below they visit
Galicia, an allusion to

00:41:37.184 --> 00:41:41.199
Santiago, and then she herself
will go on.

00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:48.530
I want to--before we read the
passage I want to give you this,

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:53.454
"And that compassionate
one," line 50 that

00:41:53.454 --> 00:41:57.123
Beatrice's presentation of Dante
to St.

00:41:57.123 --> 00:41:58.090
James.
 

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:02.974
"And that compassionate
one who directed the feathers of

00:42:02.974 --> 00:42:06.230
my wings,"
a flight of the soul,

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:10.610
the name of the family
Alighieri, "to so high a

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:15.420
flight anticipated my reply:
'The Church Militant,'"

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.257
this is Beatrice,
"'has not a child more

00:42:19.257 --> 00:42:22.465
full of hope,
as is written in the Sun that

00:42:22.465 --> 00:42:27.507
irradiates all our host;
therefore is it granted him to

00:42:27.507 --> 00:42:33.711
come from Egypt to Jerusalem,
that he may see it before his

00:42:33.711 --> 00:42:36.599
warfare is accomplished.
 

00:42:36.599 --> 00:42:39.251
The other two points about
which thou didst ask--not for

00:42:39.251 --> 00:42:41.373
enlightenment,
but for him to report how dear

00:42:41.373 --> 00:42:43.639
this virtue is to thee--I leave
to himself;

00:42:43.639 --> 00:42:46.940
for they will not be hard for
him, nor occasion for

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.646
boasting,"
and then like a pupil once

00:42:49.646 --> 00:42:53.539
again taking this language of
school, the school child.

00:42:53.539 --> 00:42:57.222
The main thing about this
self--this presentation by

00:42:57.222 --> 00:43:01.989
Beatrice is that Dante's journey
is glossed through one figure,

00:43:01.989 --> 00:43:05.719
one figure that I have been
telling you ever since we

00:43:05.719 --> 00:43:09.510
started this course,
these classes in September

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:11.980
through the figure of Exodus.
 

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:16.472
Dante's journey here is
literally described as a journey

00:43:16.472 --> 00:43:21.858
from Egypt to Jerusalem,
which is the master plot of the

00:43:21.858 --> 00:43:27.806
Hebrews' exile from the bondage
to the story of freedom and

00:43:27.806 --> 00:43:33.567
exile becomes really the--
that of exile is the figure

00:43:33.567 --> 00:43:37.179
of--the master figure of the
poem.

00:43:37.179 --> 00:43:41.070
Dante then therefore is linking
now exile and hope,

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:44.623
and I think I already have
indicated to you that this idea

00:43:44.623 --> 00:43:48.239
of writing as writing in the
mode of exile is also the--

00:43:48.239 --> 00:43:52.125
it's not to be seen in a
subjective way only relating to

00:43:52.125 --> 00:43:55.103
him,
or the pre-condition to his own

00:43:55.103 --> 00:43:58.469
poetry but involves the whole of
history.

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:04.119
History has to be seen from the
standpoint of exile,

00:44:04.119 --> 00:44:13.530
so there's at the top of page
363, line 69,

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.820
"'Hope' I said,"
again,

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:19.981
"is a sure expectation of
future glory,"

00:44:19.981 --> 00:44:23.550
as is the openness to time as
futurity,

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:25.927
"and it springs from
divine grace and precedent

00:44:25.927 --> 00:44:26.300
merit.
 

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.429
This light comes to me from
many stars,

00:44:28.429 --> 00:44:32.242
but he first distilled it in my
heart who was the sovereign

00:44:32.242 --> 00:44:35.199
singer of the Sovereign
Lord," David,

00:44:35.199 --> 00:44:40.349
who to Dante is the greatest of
poets.

00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:46.594
Now we move on from here now to
the last virtue,

00:44:46.594 --> 00:44:50.050
the last virtue of love.
 

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:55.320
It is--there is a progression
faith,

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.460
hope, and charity,
it is as if only--

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:01.777
you have to know these virtues
before the beatific vision can

00:45:01.777 --> 00:45:03.650
even be possible to you.
 

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:07.543
You have to understand what it
is that they do to you and they

00:45:07.543 --> 00:45:08.630
produce in you.
 

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:13.563
We come to love,
however, we are--we would be

00:45:13.563 --> 00:45:20.179
looking for a definition of it
as at least in a formula,

00:45:20.179 --> 00:45:26.050
in a kind of a citational
formula given and available in

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:29.608
Canto XXIV and XXV,
we would be looking for it in

00:45:29.608 --> 00:45:29.860
vain.
 

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:36.679
There's no definition of love,
and it's clear to me,

00:45:36.679 --> 00:45:40.489
it's clear to you,
I take that Dante really thinks

00:45:40.489 --> 00:45:43.289
that this is "the
word."

00:45:43.289 --> 00:45:47.436
Love is the key word that seems
to escape all possible

00:45:47.436 --> 00:45:50.217
definitions,
which we know around us,

00:45:50.217 --> 00:45:54.293
in a variety of ways,
we understand it and yet we

00:45:54.293 --> 00:45:58.050
cannot quite confine it and
define it,

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:02.065
and that to define it would
really literally be a way of

00:46:02.065 --> 00:46:05.349
reducing its impact and reducing
its value.

00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:09.532
It's such a basic word that
Dante says that the only word

00:46:09.532 --> 00:46:14.007
that is really left,
imaginary, etymologizing in

00:46:14.007 --> 00:46:18.400
this treatise on language that
he writes,

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.659
this treatises on the De
vulgari eloquentia,

00:46:21.659 --> 00:46:26.648
he says that the word love is
the only residual term from the

00:46:26.648 --> 00:46:30.389
past that means that language is
a way of--

00:46:30.389 --> 00:46:34.070
like food, the banquet,
the beginning of Canto XXIV,

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:37.579
is a way of gathering us and
bringing us together,

00:46:37.579 --> 00:46:40.833
so love and food,
food is given as a metaphor at

00:46:40.833 --> 00:46:44.047
the beginning,
now love that escapes any

00:46:44.047 --> 00:46:48.614
particular definition and yet
it's the culmination of all

00:46:48.614 --> 00:46:50.980
these theological virtues.
 

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:57.237
What Dante does see and he
has--I really want to turn to

00:46:57.237 --> 00:47:03.610
this scene at the end of Canto
XXVI, Dante meets Adam.

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:07.619
It's the confrontation with the
beginning,

00:47:07.619 --> 00:47:10.630
it's the confrontation with the
arch poet,

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:13.659
because Adam is the one who
names the world,

00:47:13.659 --> 00:47:16.170
and therefore brings it into
existence;

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:19.635
that's really what we mean by
poet and that's what we're

00:47:19.635 --> 00:47:22.965
expecting of poets to do,
since this is the meeting,

00:47:22.965 --> 00:47:26.840
the encounter with him,
lines 90 and following,

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:32.583
Dante addresses him,
"O fruit,"

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:38.489
though the word really is
apple,

00:47:38.489 --> 00:47:43.230
"O fruit that alone wast
brought forth ripe."

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.268
What on earth does he mean?
 

00:47:45.268 --> 00:47:48.126
That's a strange way of
addressing someone,

00:47:48.126 --> 00:47:51.730
"oh fruit alone wast
brought forth ripe."

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:58.130
There were a lot of theological
debates as to ripeness is an

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:02.795
element of grace,
a description of grace for

00:48:02.795 --> 00:48:03.880
Dante.
 

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.585
If you're not ripe,
when you are ripe when you have

00:48:07.585 --> 00:48:10.329
received and been touched by
grace.

00:48:10.329 --> 00:48:15.123
The argument was,
Adam created in a natural

00:48:15.123 --> 00:48:21.400
state, or was he already created
in a state of grace?

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.210
How long was he in the earthly
paradise before he fell?

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:33.909
If he was in a state of grace
why could he--why did he fall?

00:48:33.909 --> 00:48:38.623
If he was in a state of grace
why could he commit this sin of

00:48:38.623 --> 00:48:39.880
transgression?
 

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:44.527
Is it a transgression that he
commits by eating of the fruit

00:48:44.527 --> 00:48:45.630
of the tree?
 

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:49.219
Dante implies that he was in a
state of grace,

00:48:49.219 --> 00:48:52.181
ripe, refers to him as
ripeness, the idea of

00:48:52.181 --> 00:48:55.900
"fruit that alone was
brought forth ripe."

00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:01.050
"O ancient father of whom
every bride is daughter,

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:04.929
and daughter-in-law,"
this is the very language that

00:49:04.929 --> 00:49:08.393
Dante will deploy in
Paradiso XXXIII for the

00:49:08.393 --> 00:49:12.550
prayer to the Virgin and being
the daughter of her son--

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:18.219
the question of the divinity
and humanity of Christ.

00:49:18.219 --> 00:49:21.639
"As humbly as I may I
besiege thee to speak with me.

00:49:21.639 --> 00:49:24.367
Thou seest my wish,
and to hear thee sooner I do

00:49:24.367 --> 00:49:25.530
not tell it."
 

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:31.706
Let me just skip a few lines
and see the answer that Adam

00:49:31.706 --> 00:49:35.625
will give,
line 115 and following,

00:49:35.625 --> 00:49:41.349
"Know then,
my son, that not the tasting of

00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:48.056
the tree in itself was the cause
of so long exile,"

00:49:48.056 --> 00:49:52.487
so even Adam,
the fall was in a state of

00:49:52.487 --> 00:49:57.646
exile, exile from the garden,
falling into the wilderness

00:49:57.646 --> 00:50:02.599
where he had to transform the
wilderness into a garden,

00:50:02.599 --> 00:50:06.521
so that the work would be the
way in which he could regain

00:50:06.521 --> 00:50:10.956
that which he had lost,
the garden, "but solely

00:50:10.956 --> 00:50:14.360
the trespass beyond the
mark."

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.610
I'll come back to this.
 

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:20.085
"In the place from which
thy Lady sent Virgil,"

00:50:20.085 --> 00:50:22.456
in Limbo,
"I longed for this

00:50:22.456 --> 00:50:25.951
assembly during four thousand,
three hundred and two

00:50:25.951 --> 00:50:27.710
revolutions of the sun."
 

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:33.221
He's clearly thinking about the
harrowing of hell by Christ so

00:50:33.221 --> 00:50:38.099
that added now years to the four
thousand he counts.

00:50:38.099 --> 00:50:41.490
"I saw it return to all
the lights on its track nine

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:44.518
hundred and thirty times while I
lived on earth.

00:50:44.518 --> 00:50:49.458
The tongue I spoke was all
extinct before Nimrod,"

00:50:49.458 --> 00:50:54.525
we saw him as the founder,
the giant, it's a residue of

00:50:54.525 --> 00:50:57.315
gigantomachy,
the classical idea of the

00:50:57.315 --> 00:51:01.795
giants fighting the gods,
Nimrod who builds the Tower of

00:51:01.795 --> 00:51:05.380
Babel,
so the debate between them

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.550
hinges on language.
 

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:11.706
Language is the key now and
retrospectively we really come

00:51:11.706 --> 00:51:14.768
to understand the language of
theology,

00:51:14.768 --> 00:51:18.914
the question of what is
the--what are the properties of

00:51:18.914 --> 00:51:23.443
theological language and what
are the properties beyond that

00:51:23.443 --> 00:51:24.750
of all words?
 

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:26.070
That's the argument.
 

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:29.552
"I spoke with…
Nimrod's race gave their mind

00:51:29.552 --> 00:51:32.972
to the unaccomplishable
task," the building of the

00:51:32.972 --> 00:51:35.949
Tower of Babel that would not be
finished,

00:51:35.949 --> 00:51:38.659
"for no product whatever
of reason--

00:51:38.659 --> 00:51:42.449
since human choice is renewed
with the course of heaven--

00:51:42.449 --> 00:51:45.239
can last forever.
 

00:51:45.239 --> 00:51:50.141
It is a work of nature that man
should speak,

00:51:50.141 --> 00:51:57.159
but whether in this way or that
nature then leaves you to follow

00:51:57.159 --> 00:51:59.610
your own pleasure.
 

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:04.143
Before I descended to the
anguish of Hell the Supreme Good

00:52:04.143 --> 00:52:08.916
from whom comes the joy that
swathes me was named I on

00:52:08.916 --> 00:52:10.190
earth."
 

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:13.344
"I"
in Italian, not "I"

00:52:13.344 --> 00:52:16.876
in the sense of the subject;
I don't think that that's what

00:52:16.876 --> 00:52:17.429
Dante meant.
 

00:52:17.429 --> 00:52:20.829
"And later he was called
El;"

00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:25.561
Dante's using two Hebrew words,
what he takes them to be Hebrew

00:52:25.561 --> 00:52:27.699
words for the name of God.
 

00:52:27.699 --> 00:52:31.097
God was called "I"
first and then he was called

00:52:31.097 --> 00:52:32.130
"El."
 

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:36.235
In fact, this is--one of my
students suggested to me that if

00:52:36.235 --> 00:52:40.202
you read them backwards they
really spell out the word Eli

00:52:40.202 --> 00:52:44.447
which would be a word that we
would acknowledge maybe nowadays

00:52:44.447 --> 00:52:47.650
as being the word for an appeal
to God,

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:51.570
I and he was called El,
"and that is fitting,

00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:54.980
for the usage of mortals is
like a leaf on a branch,

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.909
which goes and another comes.
 

00:52:57.909 --> 00:53:01.480
On the mountain that rises
highest from the sea I lived,

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:05.583
pure, then guilty from the
first hour to that following the

00:53:05.583 --> 00:53:07.849
sixth,
where the sun changes

00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:11.030
quadrant,"
and that's the end of this

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:12.039
encounter.
 

00:53:12.039 --> 00:53:18.570
Let me focus on this question
of the language that Dante's

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:25.329
really with--encounter with
Nimrod explicitly highlights.

00:53:25.329 --> 00:53:30.251
Adam changes Dante--through
Adam is changing the account he

00:53:30.251 --> 00:53:34.409
had given in the De vulgari
eloquentia,

00:53:34.409 --> 00:53:36.340
which is a story about the
origin of words,

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:38.952
of language,
and where he had claimed that

00:53:38.952 --> 00:53:42.304
Hebrew persists;
Adam's language unchanged

00:53:42.304 --> 00:53:46.449
through history because it was
inconceivable,

00:53:46.449 --> 00:53:49.918
he adds there,
that Jesus would be using a

00:53:49.918 --> 00:53:54.826
language other than the primal
language and not the corrupt

00:53:54.826 --> 00:53:57.280
language of human beings.
 

00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:02.152
Now the story changes,
actually Adam's language has

00:54:02.152 --> 00:54:08.096
suffered alterations already in
the Garden, where the names of

00:54:08.096 --> 00:54:10.239
God keep changing.
 

00:54:10.239 --> 00:54:12.409
This, I think, is the key.
 

00:54:12.409 --> 00:54:15.152
This is the whole question of
theology then,

00:54:15.152 --> 00:54:18.150
the names of God,
the way we speak about God.

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:22.947
God was called "I,"
and then he was called

00:54:22.947 --> 00:54:26.896
"El,"
there is no proper name for

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:27.650
God.
 

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:34.628
We only have words or languages
that keep changing according to

00:54:34.628 --> 00:54:38.679
our own historical
circumstances,

00:54:38.679 --> 00:54:43.067
and Dante goes on changing his
own paradigmatic account about

00:54:43.067 --> 00:54:45.699
the status of the sacred
language.

00:54:45.699 --> 00:54:50.396
He says there is no such a
thing as a persistent sacred

00:54:50.396 --> 00:54:52.309
language in history.
 

00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:58.577
What comes out is that language
is the mark of our own distance

00:54:58.577 --> 00:55:02.742
from the divine,
that we are--and the language

00:55:02.742 --> 00:55:07.612
that we use is a part of our own
exilic circumstances and exilic

00:55:07.612 --> 00:55:11.219
predicament,
and therefore all the language

00:55:11.219 --> 00:55:15.722
of theology that Dante has been
describing is part of this

00:55:15.722 --> 00:55:18.409
exilic longing of human beings.
 

00:55:18.409 --> 00:55:23.409
This is the story from XXIV,
XXV, and XXVI.

00:55:23.409 --> 00:55:28.900
Dante uses theology and
examination of theology only to

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:34.681
place us back on the world--
on this world where we go on

00:55:34.681 --> 00:55:37.498
hoping,
believing, and loving,

00:55:37.498 --> 00:55:41.730
realizing that these are all
mysterious terms,

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:44.351
without which,
however, that's another meaning

00:55:44.351 --> 00:55:47.025
of the word for--
the resonance of money,

00:55:47.025 --> 00:55:50.114
without which we--
where we know faith is a form

00:55:50.114 --> 00:55:53.456
of trust without which you
cannot really be functioning

00:55:53.456 --> 00:55:54.199
together.
 

00:55:54.199 --> 00:55:58.320
Where we have hope as the
realization of faith,

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.199
and where we have love as that
which is--

00:56:01.199 --> 00:56:05.833
we are always longing for and
somehow the meaning of which is

00:56:05.833 --> 00:56:07.920
mysteriously escaping us.
 

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:11.210
These are, I think,
the three fundamental issues

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:15.269
that Dante is discussing and let
me take some questions.

00:56:25.469 --> 00:56:30.661
Student:  You passed
over briefly this statement of

00:56:30.661 --> 00:56:36.215
Adam that his transgression was
not in the act of testamentary

00:56:36.215 --> 00:56:39.039
but in crossing a boundary.
 

00:56:39.039 --> 00:56:43.396
I wonder if you could unpack
that a little more because it

00:56:43.396 --> 00:56:46.335
seems to me not--
it seems to me a bit of a

00:56:46.335 --> 00:56:49.838
controversial statement first of
all because the command was

00:56:49.838 --> 00:56:53.166
"do not eat from the
tree," so for Dante to say

00:56:53.166 --> 00:56:55.474
this,
it seems like he's--there's

00:56:55.474 --> 00:56:59.338
something very specific that he
wants to get across in this idea

00:56:59.338 --> 00:57:01.594
of boundary,
maybe if you could elucidate

00:57:01.594 --> 00:57:02.960
that for me a little further.
 

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.583
Prof: The question is,
a question that I really

00:57:05.583 --> 00:57:07.860
welcome, and I was hoping
someone would ask.

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:11.579
The question is that I did
not--I read from,

00:57:11.579 --> 00:57:17.626
I did not really explain the
Adam statement when he says that

00:57:17.626 --> 00:57:22.865
his sin was not in the tasting
of the tree but in the

00:57:22.865 --> 00:57:28.242
trespassing of the limit,
the mark, and therefore it

00:57:28.242 --> 00:57:33.670
seems that there is some issue
of boundaries here and would I

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:38.010
care to reply--
try to give a response to that.

00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:43.840
Yeah, I could give a response
on a number of levels.

00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:47.731
First of all,
I would remind you that this is

00:57:47.731 --> 00:57:52.070
Canto XXVI of Paradise,
and Canto XXVI of

00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:57.083
Paradise is symmetrically
connected with the other two

00:57:57.083 --> 00:58:01.213
Cantos XXVI,
the canto of Ulysses who also

00:58:01.213 --> 00:58:06.487
trespasses the boundaries,
who is a metaphysician of

00:58:06.487 --> 00:58:11.750
sorts, who is dealing with space
and who himself--

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:15.688
there is really nowhere on
earth he is really going;

00:58:15.688 --> 00:58:19.320
he doesn't know;
he's trying to go somewhere but

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.199
doesn't really know that.
 

00:58:21.199 --> 00:58:27.822
They are connected--and then
Canto XXVI of Purgatory

00:58:27.822 --> 00:58:34.329
dealing with love in its
perverted form of Guinizelli,

00:58:34.329 --> 00:58:37.356
of the poets and Caesar,
so that's one of the

00:58:37.356 --> 00:58:38.320
connections.
 

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.742
Another connection is that
these are three cantos where

00:58:41.742 --> 00:58:43.960
Dante is using foreign
languages.

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:50.739
There's a deliberate connection
there in the Canto of XXVI of

00:58:50.739 --> 00:58:52.659
Inferno.
 

00:58:52.659 --> 00:58:56.829
You may remember that Virgil
goes out of the way to speak--

00:58:56.829 --> 00:58:59.434
be the one who is the
interlocutor of Ulysses and

00:58:59.434 --> 00:59:02.231
supposedly to speak Greek,
in Canto XXVI of

00:59:02.231 --> 00:59:05.364
Purgatory,
Dante uses the Provencal

00:59:05.364 --> 00:59:09.336
language of Arnault Daniel who
now starts speaking in

00:59:09.336 --> 00:59:11.690
Provencal,
and then now we are

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:14.309
using--Dante's using the foreign
language,

00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:19.739
Hebrew, the names of God,
so it's--that's one connection,

00:59:19.739 --> 00:59:23.179
so there are a lot of other,
of these connections.

00:59:23.179 --> 00:59:26.989
In the case of Adam,
who makes that distinction,

00:59:26.989 --> 00:59:30.079
to come specifically to your
point,

00:59:30.079 --> 00:59:33.242
who makes the distinction
between the tasting of the fruit

00:59:33.242 --> 00:59:35.630
and it was not that he tasted
the fruit,

00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:39.750
but that he trespassed the mark.
 

00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:44.168
That seems to be--you're right,
that was a very controversial

00:59:44.168 --> 00:59:47.657
subject,
because indeed that was the

00:59:47.657 --> 00:59:52.579
command given to Adam,
"Thou shall not taste of

00:59:52.579 --> 00:59:57.483
the fruit of this tree,"
and Dante presents Adam who

00:59:57.483 --> 01:00:00.199
instead goes out to do that.
 

01:00:00.199 --> 01:00:04.831
It's clear that he thinks that
the tasting of the tree was

01:00:04.831 --> 01:00:08.489
not--he's saying that that was
not his sin.

01:00:08.489 --> 01:00:10.500
That's Dante's take on it.
 

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:14.000
It's not the tasting of the
tree that was the sin;

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.130
the sin was that he abolished
all boundaries.

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:25.659
I read that--I'm restating
the--changing slightly so I'm

01:00:25.659 --> 01:00:31.994
giving a paraphrase of what has
been--what seems to be the issue

01:00:31.994 --> 01:00:32.900
here.
 

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:39.202
It's clear that Dante thinks
that Adam's act of eating of the

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:44.253
tree was good,
and Adam's act of the eating of

01:00:44.253 --> 01:00:49.936
the tree was actually the
discovery of a knowledge that

01:00:49.936 --> 01:00:53.253
had--
that managed to elevate him and

01:00:53.253 --> 01:00:54.449
that was good.
 

01:00:54.449 --> 01:00:58.010
From this point of view this
is--there seems to be a contrast

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:01.097
between Ulysses' form of
knowledge and Adam's form of

01:01:01.097 --> 01:01:01.929
knowledge.
 

01:01:01.929 --> 01:01:07.059
Ulysses' form of knowledge is
that he literally is--

01:01:07.059 --> 01:01:09.913
does not go,
doesn't even know where he is

01:01:09.913 --> 01:01:12.079
going,
that's part of the problem,

01:01:12.079 --> 01:01:13.789
in purely metaphysical terms.
 

01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:17.679
He had no directions,
it was a gratuitous quest.

01:01:17.679 --> 01:01:21.952
In the case of Adam,
getting to know of the fruit of

01:01:21.952 --> 01:01:24.300
the tree was not an issue.
 

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:28.333
In fact, Dante says,
that maybe real knowledge is

01:01:28.333 --> 01:01:32.954
always going to be tied to an
act of making discoveries,

01:01:32.954 --> 01:01:35.559
making even transgressions.
 

01:01:35.559 --> 01:01:39.246
What was the problem is that
there had been a loss of

01:01:39.246 --> 01:01:41.090
boundaries that he lost.
 

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:43.340
How are we to understand the
loss of boundary?

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:48.186
It was the kind of knowledge
that made Adam realize that he

01:01:48.186 --> 01:01:51.599
could be divine;
that was his problem.

01:01:51.599 --> 01:01:55.090
As soon as you--the imposition
of the boundary,

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:58.976
God's imposition of--or
establishment of the boundary

01:01:58.976 --> 01:02:03.612
between the human and the divine
was also a way of letting Adam

01:02:03.612 --> 01:02:06.152
know--
I'm not going to read this as

01:02:06.152 --> 01:02:09.369
if it were a kind of atheistical
statement at all,

01:02:09.369 --> 01:02:14.275
it's letting Adam know that he
had to be aware that he was not

01:02:14.275 --> 01:02:16.960
divine,
that he was a human being.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.275
What he, Adam,
wanted to do was grow in

01:02:20.275 --> 01:02:24.989
knowledge and discover that he
could also be divine.

01:02:24.989 --> 01:02:26.179
Do you understand what I'm
saying?

01:02:26.179 --> 01:02:27.760
That is the issue.
 

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.476
For him to fall then would be a
way of re-establishing that

01:02:32.476 --> 01:02:37.599
boundary and realize that he is
a human being and not divine.

01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:40.699
It's a growth in self-knowledge.
 

01:02:40.699 --> 01:02:43.969
If you really know that you--if
you really know who you are,

01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:45.800
you are really--you have grown.
 

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.110
Do you see what I'm saying?
 

01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:53.929
Dante's changing the sense of
what the fall of man is,

01:02:53.929 --> 01:02:58.157
and the fall of man is not the
fall in the growth of knowledge

01:02:58.157 --> 01:03:02.108
but that growth of knowledge
that leads you to erasing the

01:03:02.108 --> 01:03:04.710
boundary,
to believe that you are by

01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:07.719
virtue of that knowledge that
you have gained,

01:03:07.719 --> 01:03:10.000
that you are now divine.
 

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.333
This is really--the whole poem
is trying to convey to us is

01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:18.965
that this is a steady temptation
that human beings seem to have

01:03:18.965 --> 01:03:21.601
and we can't--
we need to be reminded,

01:03:21.601 --> 01:03:24.856
and when we hear it from God
himself we don't quite believe

01:03:24.856 --> 01:03:27.702
it,
and then we have to grow into

01:03:27.702 --> 01:03:32.862
that recognition of boundaries
between ourselves and something

01:03:32.862 --> 01:03:36.500
that we aspire to but we are not
it yet.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:40.085
Good question,
but I had anticipated this

01:03:40.085 --> 01:03:44.208
answer, I must say,
in a number of ways talking

01:03:44.208 --> 01:03:46.630
about Adam in the past.
 

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:49.097
I hope that you don't remember
because more or less I said the

01:03:49.097 --> 01:03:51.159
same thing--I don't know that I
mentioned before.

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:07.380
One might wonder,
just to go back to that issue,

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:12.753
one might wonder,
does Dante really make it clear

01:04:12.753 --> 01:04:19.804
that he's really not Adam but he
still thinks that he is Ulysses

01:04:19.804 --> 01:04:21.820
at this point?
 

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:26.320
One thing that he understands
that he is--

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:32.134
the canto before he
acknowledges King David as the

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:34.625
supreme--
and he did earlier,

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:39.981
the supreme poet,
he's really placing himself in

01:04:39.981 --> 01:04:48.461
David's Psalms are the lyrical
recapitulations of and glossing

01:04:48.461 --> 01:04:50.268
of Exodus.
 

01:04:50.268 --> 01:04:54.992
That's really where he now I
think is trying to move that

01:04:54.992 --> 01:04:57.904
he's more--
he cannot be like Ulysses,

01:04:57.904 --> 01:05:00.641
he knows he's not--
he does not want to be,

01:05:00.641 --> 01:05:04.831
he cannot be Adam,
that's the kind of model he's

01:05:04.831 --> 01:05:07.960
trying to regain for himself.
 

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.663
Okay, maybe you see the
connection with where we said a

01:05:12.663 --> 01:05:17.367
little earlier with what I--the
response I gave to your

01:05:17.367 --> 01:05:18.500
question.
 

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:26.969
Yes.
 

01:05:26.969 --> 01:05:29.010
Student:  I'm just going
off of Dante's theological

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:29.369
beliefs.
 

01:05:29.369 --> 01:05:32.862
In Canto XXIV he talks about
his belief in the Trinity and I

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:36.179
was wondering if you could just
explain that further,

01:05:36.179 --> 01:05:40.041
because he seems to be saying
both that the Trinity are three

01:05:40.041 --> 01:05:42.230
separate entities and the unity.
 

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:45.369
I know there was controversy
and different factions of

01:05:45.369 --> 01:05:47.639
different--
different factions in

01:05:47.639 --> 01:05:51.994
Christianity believe different
things about the Trinity and so

01:05:51.994 --> 01:05:54.780
I was wondering what Dante
believed.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.543
Prof: Well,
Dante has a number of

01:05:57.543 --> 01:06:01.440
references throughout
Paradise to the Trinity.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:05.909
One of them actually,
a very significant one,

01:06:05.909 --> 01:06:10.309
that we never talked about was
in Canto XXV of Purgatory

01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:14.710
where Dante thinks that the way
we human beings understand--

01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:19.471
can understand it--one of the
ways which we can understand the

01:06:19.471 --> 01:06:23.452
Trinity is to think about the
structure of the mind:

01:06:23.452 --> 01:06:25.211
memory,
intelligence,

01:06:25.211 --> 01:06:28.820
and will because there are
three but part of one thing,

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.309
and three functions.
 

01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:33.059
Or, in Canto XXIV,
of Purgatorio that

01:06:33.059 --> 01:06:37.096
Professor Lummus,
I'm sure explained to you,

01:06:37.096 --> 01:06:40.641
is that the--
if you want to understand Dante

01:06:40.641 --> 01:06:43.500
there seems to imply when he
talks about,

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:48.391
I am one when he declares his
own poetic practice and one who

01:06:48.391 --> 01:06:51.409
when loved and dictates inside
me,

01:06:51.409 --> 01:06:54.949
I go on using my language and
so on.

01:06:54.949 --> 01:06:58.268
One way, in which the Trinity
was explained,

01:06:58.268 --> 01:07:01.818
they would say,
think about speaking to make it

01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:05.059
existentially compelling and
concrete.

01:07:05.059 --> 01:07:07.954
When you speak,
you have an idea in your mind,

01:07:07.954 --> 01:07:09.500
otherwise it's babble.
 

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:15.260
You have an idea in your mind,
you emit a sound,

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:18.760
but to emit the sound you need
the breath,

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.789
and you cannot have the sound
without the breath,

01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:23.730
and you cannot have the sound
without the idea,

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:30.072
so that speaking encompasses
this three-fold components of

01:07:30.072 --> 01:07:30.739
one.
 

01:07:30.739 --> 01:07:32.869
The Trinity is always connected
to one.

01:07:32.869 --> 01:07:35.860
Then in Canto X of
Paradise,

01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.518
you remember,
we spent some time there,

01:07:37.518 --> 01:07:40.268
having this idea of the love of
the Father,

01:07:40.268 --> 01:07:42.623
and the Son,
and the breath of love that

01:07:42.623 --> 01:07:45.029
joins them,
they go on gazing together,

01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:48.264
this idea of the fecundity or
this idea of the Trinity as

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:50.996
source,
or Dante who thinks about God

01:07:50.996 --> 01:07:55.260
in the form of the Mover,
but he does go into that and

01:07:55.260 --> 01:08:00.126
yet he understands that that's
not the effective theology he

01:08:00.126 --> 01:08:03.840
wants to think of God as the
Prime Mover,

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:09.342
to think as the efficient
cause, it makes God as such a

01:08:09.342 --> 01:08:13.518
mechanic or a clockmaker or
something,

01:08:13.518 --> 01:08:18.886
one of these images of God who
imparts order and recedes from

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:19.869
creation.
 

01:08:19.869 --> 01:08:21.500
That's really not Dante's idea.
 

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:28.471
He wants to think of a divinity
that is partaking of creation's

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:29.260
love.
 

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:34.496
Dante's idea of the Trinity--so
he has many, many--he tests all

01:08:34.496 --> 01:08:36.270
of these paradigms.
 

01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:38.350
I don't think that he ever
excludes one.

01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:42.979
He does not really agree with
the reading of Joachim of Flora

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:46.760
who thought that the Trinity was
the unity of--

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.859
that Trinity could be dissolved
into three separate beings,

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.670
so that's no longer a unity.
 

01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:55.546
To have a unity you got to have
all three clearly present,

01:08:55.546 --> 01:08:57.520
that's what Dante believes.
 

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.801
A unity with a kind of--is it a
prismatic unity let me call it,

01:09:02.801 --> 01:09:03.908
that's why.
 

01:09:03.908 --> 01:09:08.025
Dante would say,
we all have some recognition of

01:09:08.025 --> 01:09:12.724
the Trinity,
whether it's God and the Word

01:09:12.724 --> 01:09:19.725
of God being the Qu'ran from
eternally or God and the Word of

01:09:19.725 --> 01:09:23.109
God being the Christ,
etc.

01:09:23.109 --> 01:09:26.881
We all have the word made
flesh, we all have some kind of

01:09:26.881 --> 01:09:30.475
idea of the Trinity,
where one acknowledges God as a

01:09:30.475 --> 01:09:32.838
Father,
or as a Spirit,

01:09:32.838 --> 01:09:39.090
ways in which we can understand
this thing we call,

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:42.038
I don't mean irreverently,
we call God.

01:09:42.038 --> 01:09:47.810
That's the response to what you
asked.

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:49.890
Please.
 

01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:52.292
Student:  From what you
said in answer to the other

01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:54.489
question,
it seems like you were saying

01:09:54.489 --> 01:09:57.695
that if Dante takes the fall
it's good enough because it

01:09:57.695 --> 01:09:59.270
leads to self-knowledge.
 

01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:02.215
Dante thinks the fall is good
because it leads to more

01:10:02.215 --> 01:10:03.158
self-knowledge.
 

01:10:03.158 --> 01:10:05.340
I understand how it's different
from--

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:08.252
Adam is different from Ulysses
in that he is trying to go

01:10:08.252 --> 01:10:10.350
somewhere,
like he's trying to become more

01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:12.868
like God and that's good because
it's a definite end,

01:10:12.868 --> 01:10:16.368
but it still seems that if the
means of trying to achieve that

01:10:16.368 --> 01:10:17.229
end is wrong.
 

01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:19.560
If he's trying to become more
like God by,

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:23.015
like grasping instead of--like
we've been talking a lot about

01:10:23.015 --> 01:10:25.676
how the--
and that's real essential and

01:10:25.676 --> 01:10:29.238
if he's choosing the wrong way
to get to his end,

01:10:29.238 --> 01:10:32.109
if that changes the end itself
so that he's not even really--

01:10:32.109 --> 01:10:35.301
Adam's not even like having the
proper end in his search for

01:10:35.301 --> 01:10:36.328
knowledge either.
 

01:10:36.328 --> 01:10:39.189
If it changes because he's
going about it in the wrong way

01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:42.100
and just how that kind of
reflects on whether the fall--

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:43.840
whether Dante thinks the fall
itself feels like it's good and

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.029
is actually leading to something
else,

01:10:45.029 --> 01:10:46.170
if that's clear.
 

01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:48.819
Prof: No,
it's very clear.

01:10:48.819 --> 01:10:52.618
The question is--the earlier
question, of course,

01:10:52.618 --> 01:10:56.420
was about what Dante thinks
about the Trinity.

01:10:56.420 --> 01:11:01.788
Now the question is going back
to the point of Adam,

01:11:01.788 --> 01:11:06.880
and my suggestion that the fall
is good,

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:11.956
and because ultimately Adam
seems to be really wanting to

01:11:11.956 --> 01:11:17.666
reach God and I made a contrast
to Ulysses and the limitation of

01:11:17.666 --> 01:11:22.380
Ulysses' quest is that he really
does not know--

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:23.868
he's driven by curiosity.
 

01:11:23.868 --> 01:11:28.435
That's what I meant which we
will talk about,

01:11:28.435 --> 01:11:30.720
this evil curiosity.
 

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:36.201
But if the movement toward the
good is bad, because after all,

01:11:36.201 --> 01:11:40.065
Adam does choose to trespass
the boundaries,

01:11:40.065 --> 01:11:44.198
why should that really be
thought as good?

01:11:44.198 --> 01:11:46.880
Is that--that was the question
really?

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:51.180
Well, let me just restate this
issue.

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.670
The problem with Adam--I'm
sorry, first of all,

01:11:54.670 --> 01:11:58.710
with Ulysses I call it now the
curiosity,

01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:02.277
which as you know,
eventually will become good in

01:12:02.277 --> 01:12:05.354
the Renaissance,
scientific curiosity,

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:07.180
that's the good thing.
 

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:11.158
In fact, I have a young
colleague who is writing a

01:12:11.158 --> 01:12:15.140
thesis about curiosity--a book
about curiosity.

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.506
She has written a thesis about
curiosity linking it with

01:12:17.506 --> 01:12:19.738
women's curiosity,
it's a very interesting thesis

01:12:19.738 --> 01:12:22.265
to say that women are really
smarter than men because they

01:12:22.265 --> 01:12:23.568
are--
they have been attacked for

01:12:23.568 --> 01:12:25.966
being curious,
so she has found Renaissance

01:12:25.966 --> 01:12:28.621
texts were--
some written by women who go on

01:12:28.621 --> 01:12:30.189
making that kind of claim.
 

01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:31.630
I think it's a great idea.
 

01:12:31.630 --> 01:12:34.590
How did Dante understand
curiosity?

01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:37.550
How do the Fathers of the
Church understand curiosity?

01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:38.430
Why is it bad?
 

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:42.886
Because that is the trait of
Adam, because curiosity has a

01:12:42.886 --> 01:12:46.525
particular quality about it,
it's something that continues

01:12:46.525 --> 01:12:48.841
this whole understanding,
and especially with curiosity

01:12:48.841 --> 01:12:50.952
I'm going to give you,
well in to the eighteenth

01:12:50.952 --> 01:12:51.359
century.
 

01:12:51.359 --> 01:12:56.020
The curiosity is bad because it
uses up;

01:12:56.020 --> 01:13:03.439
curiosity has a sort of
restlessness within it.

01:13:03.439 --> 01:13:06.564
I am curious of a particular
object, I observe it and I move

01:13:06.564 --> 01:13:07.729
onto something else.
 

01:13:07.729 --> 01:13:12.280
I literally consume,
I use up a particular object

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:17.970
and devalue it in that process,
that's really what made it so

01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:18.729
bad.
 

01:13:18.729 --> 01:13:22.404
Ulysses, who goes from one
thing to another and is always

01:13:22.404 --> 01:13:24.467
open,
fascinating figure of the

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:30.015
Renaissance spirit of discovery,
but that's really what undoes

01:13:30.015 --> 01:13:36.229
this element almost of desire,
a kind of--a figure of--I don't

01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:39.967
want to make--
I'm using this to badmouth

01:13:39.967 --> 01:13:42.407
Ulysses,
but a figure of this way of

01:13:42.407 --> 01:13:45.516
thinking of the curiosity of
Ulysses is really the don Juan

01:13:45.516 --> 01:13:48.520
who goes from one woman to
another in an endless movement

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:52.780
of curiosity and knowledge,
that he's driven by knowledge

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:56.819
to get to know certain
particular situations and

01:13:56.819 --> 01:13:57.680
people.
 

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:01.422
Adam, to go back to the
question of Adam,

01:14:01.422 --> 01:14:04.979
I'm only giving you Dante's
reading.

01:14:04.979 --> 01:14:08.713
Dante's reading--he
distinguishes very carefully

01:14:08.713 --> 01:14:12.527
between the testing,
the tasting of the fruit and

01:14:12.527 --> 01:14:15.069
the trespassing of the mark.
 

01:14:15.069 --> 01:14:19.743
The trespassing of the mark
meant you cannot really violate

01:14:19.743 --> 01:14:24.738
the boundaries that I want to
place between you and myself,

01:14:24.738 --> 01:14:28.664
because once you get to know
yourself for what you are you

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:31.497
may get to know me,
that's what the part of the

01:14:31.497 --> 01:14:32.720
violation of boundaries.
 

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.340
You may get to know me for what
I am,

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:40.201
so it's a wall that protects
both the essence of the divinity

01:14:40.201 --> 01:14:44.819
and the specific quality of the
human that is at stake.

01:14:44.819 --> 01:14:49.408
Adam eats, which means that he
wants to grow in knowledge,

01:14:49.408 --> 01:14:52.550
and Dante says,
that's not the issue.

01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:55.529
That was not a problem that I
want to grow in knowledge.

01:14:55.529 --> 01:14:59.826
The consequence of that growth
in knowledge was the

01:14:59.826 --> 01:15:03.605
trespassing--actually very well
be the cause,

01:15:03.605 --> 01:15:06.698
the trespassing of the
boundary.

01:15:06.698 --> 01:15:13.386
Had he really grown,
that's really an acceptable

01:15:13.386 --> 01:15:15.560
aim;
you have to grow in knowledge.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:19.613
I'm willing to say about Adam
exactly the things that you may

01:15:19.613 --> 01:15:23.935
recall I said about the scene of
pride when we discussed Canto X,

01:15:23.935 --> 01:15:24.948
XI and XII.
 

01:15:24.948 --> 01:15:28.646
It's good that you have this
love of excellence and love of

01:15:28.646 --> 01:15:30.560
the growth of your own mind.
 

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:36.173
The consequence of it or the
flip side of this quest for more

01:15:36.173 --> 01:15:41.601
knowledge is the violation of
boundaries and that has to be

01:15:41.601 --> 01:15:43.380
re-established.
 

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:46.810
The fall of man is only a
re-establishment of the

01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:49.662
boundaries;
it's not a way of mortifying

01:15:49.662 --> 01:15:51.380
the quest for knowledge.
 

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.229
I'm restating what I--different
terms--

01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:57.180
slightly different terms what I
said before,

01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:00.604
but I think that's really a
crucial distinction and I would

01:16:00.604 --> 01:16:05.185
ask you to try to think--
I see a difference between the

01:16:05.185 --> 01:16:06.779
two situations.
 

01:16:06.779 --> 01:16:12.000
I hope you--I have time for
another--no we don't.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.640
See you next time.

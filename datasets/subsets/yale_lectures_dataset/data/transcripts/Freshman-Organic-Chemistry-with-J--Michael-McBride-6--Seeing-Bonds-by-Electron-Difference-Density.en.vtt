00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.450
Prof: So we want to
understand diffraction patterns.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.744
It's clear that there's some
relationship between the

00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:12.355
arrangement of the electrons
that are doing the scattering

00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:15.270
and the pattern of the
scattering you get.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.690
Right?
 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.335
At a particular angle there's a
particular intensity,

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:23.400
and it must depend on how those
electrons are arranged.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.960
But how is the
interesting question.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.405
So what we're going to do now
is look just a little bit-- --

00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:34.570
no one figures this out,
in a real case;

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.680
people have written fancy
computer programs to do this.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.294
But so that it doesn't seem
mysterious, I want you to get

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:44.520
the idea of how it works.
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.210
Okay, so the first slide we
showed,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.260
or the third slide actually
that we showed last time,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.060
was made of a bunch of these
things we call benzenes,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.051
the collections of six dots,
and they're all oriented the

00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:04.980
same way;
that's not very reasonable

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.153
except when they get regular in
a crystal, which is where we're

00:01:09.153 --> 00:01:09.760
going.
 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.980
But anyhow, if you have a whole
bunch of them,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.435
but randomly distributed,
it turns out the intensity you

00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:20.867
get is stronger,
proportional to the number of

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:22.790
them that are doing the
scattering.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.519
Right?
 

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:27.110
But the pattern you get is the
same you'd get from just one.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.569
So that's why we use this funny
slide.

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.670
And this was the pattern that
came out,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.129
this thing that looked a little
bit like a snowflake,

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:38.947
and I'd like you to understand
why that hexagon of dots gives a

00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:39.879
snowflake.
 

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:45.150
So we take the hexagon of dots,
and what do we look for to see

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.730
where scattering might be,
to see-- -- what's the-- --

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.410
remember what the trick is?
 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.458
The trick is to look at things
that lie on equally spaced

00:01:58.458 --> 00:01:59.430
planes.
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.614
Try to choose a set of planes
so that as many of the electrons

00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:09.544
as there are will fall on or
near that set of evenly spaced

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:10.479
planes.
 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.645
So And this is two dimensions,
so we're looking for lines,

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:17.348
or cross-sections of planes,
right?

00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:22.671
So how can we draw lines on
here, evenly spaced lines,

00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:26.788
so that all the dots will fall
on them?

00:02:26.788 --> 00:02:30.949
Well we can do it this way,
right?

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.586
So they're evenly spaced,
three of them,

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:36.628
and all the electrons fall on
or near them.

00:02:36.628 --> 00:02:39.008
Notice, they don't have to fall
exactly on,

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.400
because if they're displaced a
little bit,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.740
the phase of the wave will
change a little bit,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.699
compared to the others;
but only a little bit.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.120
So it just has to be near,
not exactly on.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.038
Okay, so there we have it.
 

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:56.587
Now, so that means that you'll
get scattering in that

00:02:56.587 --> 00:03:01.050
direction, where they will
reinforce one another.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:09.556
Let's go back to the display we
were looking at before,

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:10.659
here.
 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:11.658
Okay?
 

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.770
We were talking about this just
as class started.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.872
So a wave comes in,
makes these things all move up

00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:19.280
and down, the electrons,
here and here,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.610
at the same time.
 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.745
Actually, let's make all three
of them vibrate for current

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:24.349
purposes.
 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:25.710
Okay.
 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.369
Now we're interested at what
angles light can come out and

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.899
all these things will help each
other out, reinforce one

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:33.669
another.
 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.049
So as we go here and look at
that vertical line,

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.860
we see that they're not all
in-phase at that angle.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.615
But as we increase the angle,
when we get to say here,

00:03:45.615 --> 00:03:47.590
it looks not so bad.
 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.705
The top and the bottom are
actually exactly in-phase,

00:03:50.705 --> 00:03:53.222
but the middle one is exactly
out-of-phase,

00:03:53.222 --> 00:03:55.440
and it'll cancel out the top
one.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.280
And if there were a whole row
of these,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.240
the second one cancels the
first, the fourth would cancel

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.519
the third,
the sixth would cancel the

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.032
fifth, and so on;
there wouldn't be anything

00:04:07.032 --> 00:04:07.758
coming out.
 

00:04:07.758 --> 00:04:10.740
And now we go a little bit away
from that.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.878
And it's worth making a point
here.

00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:16.684
Suppose that this were a very,
very, very long line of

00:04:16.684 --> 00:04:18.120
scatterers, right?
 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.466
And the first two-- -- let's
get to this place here where

00:04:21.466 --> 00:04:25.367
they're all exactly in-phase;
that'll obviously be a very

00:04:25.367 --> 00:04:26.430
strong angle.
 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.754
But suppose we looked at
another angle that was close to

00:04:29.754 --> 00:04:31.750
that, but just a teeny bit off.
 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.079
So the first two are off by
just 1° in-phase,

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:40.050
and the next one's off by
2° in-phase;

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.379
not much off, okay?
 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.497
So are we going to get pretty
strong light coming out from

00:04:45.497 --> 00:04:45.879
that?
 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:46.949
Russell?
 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.759
Student:  If it's a very
long string, you'll eventually

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.103
get one that-- --
Prof: If it's a very

00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:56.170
long string,
if the first one's 1° out,

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.845
by the time we get to the
180th, it'll be 180°

00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:02.129
out,
or exactly-- -- so the 180th

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.288
will cancel the first one,
the 181st will cancel the

00:05:06.288 --> 00:05:10.319
second, the 182nd will cancel
the third,

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:10.889
and so on.
 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.300
Right?
 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.480
So it has to-- -- if you have a
really long string,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.899
it has to be exactly on,
from one to the next,

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:23.540
in order to get them so that
you get something coming out.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.112
And what you get coming out
then will be quite strong

00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:29.230
because it'll be the scattering
from the whole bunch of them.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.290
Right?
 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.339
Where did you see that in last
week's lecture,

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:37.050
Friday's lecture?
 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.389
Student:  In the dots.
 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.562
Prof: Right,
you saw it that you got very

00:05:41.562 --> 00:05:45.139
fine dots when you had a really
long row of things.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:53.709
Okay, so back to here.
 

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:57.040
So there'll be things that are
almost exactly in-phase,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.589
and it'll be a certain angle at
which they'll be in-phase,

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:02.850
and that angle is shown by the
end of that arrow,

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.860
and you get,
therefore, a dot there,

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.569
and also, by symmetry,
the other five of the six dots;

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.529
but you could draw the lines
other angles the same way.

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:16.259
Everybody with me on that?
 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.303
Okay, now so we look for
electron density on or near

00:06:21.303 --> 00:06:23.579
evenly spaced planes.
 

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:27.850
Now because it only has to be
near, there are other directions

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.209
we could draw it,
so we get a set of planes where

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:35.800
they're near but not on;
like here, right?

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.144
Now one is a little above the
plane, two are a little below

00:06:39.144 --> 00:06:42.603
the plane-- -- right?-- -- or
vice-versa for the second line,

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:43.180
right?
 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.463
But they're pretty close,
and they're at a certain

00:06:45.463 --> 00:06:45.930
spacing.
 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.480
Now, that spacing is larger
than the blue spacing.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.569
Does everybody see that?
 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.242
What does that mean about the
angle at which the reflection

00:06:57.242 --> 00:07:00.980
will occur, or the scattering,
where they'll be in phase?

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.220
Students:  Smaller.
 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.379
Prof: The angle will be
smaller.

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:09.711
So the part of the snowflake
that comes from that is here,

00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:10.459
right?
 

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:14.050
A smaller angle because it's a
larger distance.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.160
And you can see immediately why
that is,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.192
if we look at this thing,
that if you look at the top to

00:07:20.192 --> 00:07:22.271
the bottom,
where they're far apart,

00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:26.081
the lines are far apart,
you get the first reflection

00:07:26.081 --> 00:07:26.750
there.
 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.038
But if the lines are closer
together, like these two,

00:07:30.038 --> 00:07:34.021
then you have to go to a higher
angle in order to get that first

00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:36.110
one, first coming into phase.
 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.209
Right?
 

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:41.819
So that's that reciprocal
relationship.

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:44.144
Okay, so we get a set of six
dots like that,

00:07:44.144 --> 00:07:45.930
and that's most of the pattern.
 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.240
But there are other places too
you can see it.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.319
For example,
you can take those lines.

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:56.690
In that set of lines,
every-- -- the center of every

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.319
dot is on a line.
 

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:01.122
There happens to be a line in
the middle that doesn't have

00:08:01.122 --> 00:08:03.870
anything on it;
but who cares?

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.629
Right?
 

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:07.560
The others are on evenly spaced
lines.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.019
Right?
 

00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:09.129
So they'll all be in-phase.
 

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:12.480
Where will that one come,
that reflection,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.279
close in or far out?
 

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:14.778
Students:  Far out.
 

00:08:14.778 --> 00:08:16.603
Prof: Far out,
and there you see it,

00:08:16.603 --> 00:08:17.560
way out at the edge.
 

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.259
Can you see it there?
 

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:20.680
Just a little bit with-- -- I
could turn the room lights down,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.029
but I don't think it's worth
it.

00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:23.399
You can see that it's there.
 

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:27.480
And so there are six of them
out there as well.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.666
Okay, so you got the idea of
how by looking for evenly spaced

00:08:32.666 --> 00:08:37.852
planes you can predict what the
pattern will be for a certain

00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:40.360
arrangement of electrons.
 

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.399
Now, notice those ones far out
are very weak.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:48.938
That's because although the
centers of the dots lie right on

00:08:48.938 --> 00:08:51.274
the lines,
the lines are getting so

00:08:51.274 --> 00:08:54.726
closely spaced that there's part
of the electron density that's

00:08:54.726 --> 00:08:58.196
not right on the lines,
that in fact gets out to almost

00:08:58.196 --> 00:08:59.909
halfway between the lines.
 

00:08:59.909 --> 00:09:01.048
Right?
 

00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:04.798
And that part of the electron
density will be canceling.

00:09:04.798 --> 00:09:08.370
So most of the electron density
is all in-phase here,

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.644
but some of it is out-of-phase,
and as you get the lines closer

00:09:11.644 --> 00:09:14.505
and closer together,
the fact that the electron

00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:17.952
distribution is finite,
and not tiny points,

00:09:17.952 --> 00:09:23.166
means that things will get
weaker and weaker as you go to

00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:24.750
higher angles.
 

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.846
Okay, so there again we notice
here that the closer spaced

00:09:28.846 --> 00:09:30.860
planes give higher angles.
 

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.950
This is what we've just been
talking about.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.570
Now, when you take a slide with
a regular lattice of these

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.623
benzenes, then-- -- remember,
if you took just one,

00:09:42.623 --> 00:09:45.460
you get this snowflake pattern.
 

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.282
If you take a whole row,
across the top,

00:09:49.282 --> 00:09:55.062
like that-- -- oh pardon me,
I meant to say that one will be

00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:58.690
very weak, you can hardly see
it.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.900
What you need is a bunch of
them to cooperate,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.668
to see something that you can
see.

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:06.407
Now first we could take the
whole row along the top,

00:10:06.407 --> 00:10:10.583
and we're going to look only at
scattering in the vertical

00:10:10.583 --> 00:10:13.652
direction;
so I've narrowed in on the

00:10:13.652 --> 00:10:14.360
picture.
 

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.269
But if we take that whole row
along the top,

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:21.331
remember, they'll all scatter
in-phase at the specular angle,

00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:24.308
because-- -- for scattering up
and down.

00:10:24.308 --> 00:10:28.558
So now it gets more intense
because they're all cooperating.

00:10:28.558 --> 00:10:31.625
For other directions they
wouldn't all be in-phase from

00:10:31.625 --> 00:10:35.128
one hexagon to the next,
but for scattering up and down,

00:10:35.128 --> 00:10:38.049
where they're all at exactly
the same level,

00:10:38.049 --> 00:10:39.080
they'll all be exactly the same.
 

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.570
Okay, now suppose I add the
next row.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:48.461
Will they be in-phase,
for the same direction of

00:10:48.461 --> 00:10:53.456
scattering up and down,
where that top row is all

00:10:53.456 --> 00:10:54.808
in-phase?
 

00:10:54.808 --> 00:10:59.168
So we would get the scattering
shown here, right?

00:10:59.168 --> 00:11:02.220
Stronger than it was before
because it's a bunch of these

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.309
things now, right?
 

00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:04.740
But still not really strong.
 

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.940
But let's add in the next row.
 

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.889
Is that going to make them all
stronger again?

00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:13.015
No, most of the time they'll be
out-of-phase,

00:11:13.015 --> 00:11:15.856
from the next row,
for scattering in this

00:11:15.856 --> 00:11:16.567
direction.
 

00:11:16.567 --> 00:11:17.350
Right?
 

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.750
Most of the time they'll be
out-of-phase,

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.048
but for particular
angles they'll be in-phase.

00:11:23.048 --> 00:11:27.428
So in fact what that will do,
if we add the next row,

00:11:27.428 --> 00:11:30.743
we've made the picture brighter
because we've got twice as many

00:11:30.743 --> 00:11:35.644
things scattering now,
but there'll be bars across it,

00:11:35.644 --> 00:11:36.908
like that.
 

00:11:36.908 --> 00:11:40.616
It's always the same pattern,
getting brighter and brighter

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:44.000
as we add more of them,
but at certain angles they're

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.440
in-phase now and at certain
angles they're out-of-phase,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.960
from one pattern to the next,
or from one row to the next.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.659
Now, what's going to happen if
we add the whole sheet of them?

00:11:55.659 --> 00:12:01.139
Can you see?
 

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:01.269
Sam?
 

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:04.408
Student:  Well you're
only going to get very thin-- --

00:12:04.408 --> 00:12:06.190
Prof: Ah,
there'll only be really

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.610
precise angles,
at which they all interfere;

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.961
otherwise the 180th will
interfere with the first,

00:12:11.961 --> 00:12:14.355
the 181st with the second and
so on.

00:12:14.355 --> 00:12:15.038
Right?
 

00:12:15.038 --> 00:12:17.594
So if we add the whole phase,
the whole thing,

00:12:17.594 --> 00:12:20.772
then if we look at the pattern
it's going to be brighter,

00:12:20.772 --> 00:12:21.340
right?
 

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:26.611
But it'll be only dots,
only at very precise angles.

00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:27.440
Right?
 

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.267
And that's what we saw when we
went to this final picture for

00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:34.519
scattering from a lattice.
 

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:40.836
So what this means is that the
lattice repeat concentrates the

00:12:40.836 --> 00:12:45.705
snowflake scattering into
tightly focused spots,

00:12:45.705 --> 00:12:47.879
on a regular pattern.
 

00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:49.019
Right?
 

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:57.509
So this is the diffraction from
a 2-D lattice of benzenes,

00:12:57.509 --> 00:13:01.889
which is the same as the
underlying snowflake that came

00:13:01.889 --> 00:13:05.267
from just one,
but it's as if it were being

00:13:05.267 --> 00:13:07.785
viewed,
as I said last time,

00:13:07.785 --> 00:13:09.568
through a pegboard.
 

00:13:09.568 --> 00:13:10.320
Right?
 

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.255
All that scattering gets
concentrated into a few points,

00:13:14.255 --> 00:13:17.120
very bright,
and these regular points.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.966
Now some people seemed not to
know what a pegboard was,

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.759
so I took a picture of a
pegboard over the weekend.

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:26.107
How many people have never seen
a pegboard before,

00:13:26.107 --> 00:13:27.678
just to calibrate me?
 

00:13:27.678 --> 00:13:29.580
Okay, most people have seen a
pegboard.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.269
But you can put these hooks in
it and then hang whatever you

00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:36.836
want on it, like tools or
pictures or whatever you want to

00:13:36.836 --> 00:13:38.149
put on your wall.
 

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:40.953
Okay, so it's like looking
through the holes in that,

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:42.408
at the snowflake pattern.
 

00:13:42.408 --> 00:13:46.615
Now, there are two,
quote, spaces that get talked

00:13:46.615 --> 00:13:49.769
about: direct space or real
space;

00:13:49.769 --> 00:13:53.379
and diffraction space or
reciprocal space.

00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:53.980
Okay?
 

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.509
So the crystal is the real
thing that you're interested in,

00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:02.259
and diffraction photo is in
diffraction space;

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:05.932
you see these dots that Lowy
Laue saw, for example,

00:14:05.932 --> 00:14:07.327
for copper sulfate.
 

00:14:07.327 --> 00:14:07.990
Right?
 

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:13.190
So in real space you have a
unit cell structure;

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.836
that is, the thing,
the pattern that then gets

00:14:15.836 --> 00:14:17.659
repeated to make the crystal.
 

00:14:17.659 --> 00:14:19.700
But you have the pattern, right?
 

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.087
And that gives rise to this
fuzzy pattern,

00:14:22.087 --> 00:14:24.360
like a snowflake in reciprocal
space.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.383
And then you have a crystal
lattice, a regular repetition of

00:14:28.383 --> 00:14:30.019
these patterns,
right?

00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:34.769
And that's as viewing through
the holes in the pegboard.

00:14:34.769 --> 00:14:35.850
Okay?
 

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.298
And remember that decreased
spacing in real space

00:14:39.298 --> 00:14:43.250
corresponds to increased spacing
in reciprocal space;

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.360
which is of course why it's
called "reciprocal".

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.860
Okay, so that's what we want to
understand about how it works.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.538
Right?
 

00:14:50.538 --> 00:14:53.793
There are patterns which give
rise to patterns in reciprocal

00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:55.375
space,
that fuzzy thing,

00:14:55.375 --> 00:14:58.629
and then if you have a
repeating lattice of that,

00:14:58.629 --> 00:15:01.230
it gets concentrated into
particular points;

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.908
but it's the same underlying
pattern.

00:15:02.908 --> 00:15:06.615
So there's the pattern,
which is the structure of the

00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:10.605
molecule, and there's the
lattice, which is the structure

00:15:10.605 --> 00:15:11.960
of the crystal.
 

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.230
Okay, now let's look at the
light bulb filament,

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.580
the last thing we looked at,
and see why the scattering from

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:22.678
that looks the way we do--
-- looks like this X with dots

00:15:22.678 --> 00:15:23.850
along it.
 

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:27.871
Okay, so we take-- -- we want
to find if there are electrons

00:15:27.871 --> 00:15:29.440
on this helix,
right?

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.145
We can find a set of evenly
spaced, parallel planes like the

00:15:33.145 --> 00:15:34.340
yellow ones here.
 

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.330
So we'll get scattering
perpendicular to those planes.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.350
And sure enough there it is,
that spot.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:46.155
But we could also take a set of
planes, and it goes not only up

00:15:46.155 --> 00:15:48.558
but also down,
both branches;

00:15:48.558 --> 00:15:52.591
both directions of that
particular branch of the X,

00:15:52.591 --> 00:15:54.850
come from the same planes.
 

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:55.230
Okay?
 

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.827
But you could make planes that
are twice as close to one

00:15:58.827 --> 00:15:59.351
another.
 

00:15:59.351 --> 00:15:59.940
Right?
 

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.519
What will those give rise to?
 

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:03.970
Student:  Further out.
 

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.419
Prof: Twice as far out;
the sine is twice as big

00:16:07.419 --> 00:16:09.389
actually, not the actual
spacing.

00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:12.332
But it's that one,
the second one out along the

00:16:12.332 --> 00:16:12.909
branch.
 

00:16:12.909 --> 00:16:14.149
Okay?
 

00:16:14.149 --> 00:16:18.726
Now, will that be-- -- do you
expect that to be brighter or

00:16:18.726 --> 00:16:21.330
not as bright as the first one?
 

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.788
Student:  Not as bright.
 

00:16:22.788 --> 00:16:29.070
Prof: Not-- -- well it
probably will be not as bright,

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.777
and the reason is that for-- --
there are two things that have

00:16:31.777 --> 00:16:33.019
to do with the brightness.
 

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:37.587
One is how much density there
is on the planes versus how much

00:16:37.587 --> 00:16:39.684
there is between the planes.
 

00:16:39.684 --> 00:16:40.360
Right?
 

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.028
And we see here that-- -- say
take the original yellow one--

00:16:44.028 --> 00:16:47.894
-- there's a lot;
all this stuff is nearly on the

00:16:47.894 --> 00:16:52.918
plane, and halfway between the
plane there's not very much,

00:16:52.918 --> 00:16:56.470
just a thin cross-section of
the wire.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:57.678
Okay?
 

00:16:57.678 --> 00:17:01.399
But as the planes get closer
and closer,

00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:05.932
the fact that the wire has a
finite thickness means that some

00:17:05.932 --> 00:17:09.034
parts of the wire,
the same part of the wire,

00:17:09.034 --> 00:17:11.190
are out-of-phase compared to
others.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.942
So because of the finite
thickness you expect it to

00:17:13.942 --> 00:17:16.420
slowly fall off in intensity as
you go out;

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:21.298
but you'll then get the third
one along the branch and so on.

00:17:21.298 --> 00:17:24.333
And you can do the same trick
in the other direction.

00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:24.799
Right?
 

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:26.650
So that's why it's an X.
 

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:31.390
You can draw the analogous
mirror image lines.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.920
Okay, now what does the X,
the angle of the X tell you?

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.134
The X could look like this,
or it could look like this,

00:17:39.134 --> 00:17:39.759
right?
 

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:44.019
What do you learn from that,
the angle that the X makes?

00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:46.288
Student:  How tightly
wound the helix is.

00:17:46.288 --> 00:17:48.200
Prof: How tightly wound
the helix is,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.390
because if the helix were very
tight,

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.348
then the planes would be like
this,

00:17:52.348 --> 00:17:55.609
and if you grabbed the spring
and stretched it out,

00:17:55.609 --> 00:17:58.200
they'd look like this. Right?
 

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.901
So the angle of the X tells how
tightly wound the helix is,

00:18:01.901 --> 00:18:03.880
tells the pitch of the helix.
 

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.769
Okay?
 

00:18:04.769 --> 00:18:08.730
What does the spacing of the
spots tell you?

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.093
Did you do the homework I
suggested for today,

00:18:11.093 --> 00:18:12.880
that you didn't have to hand
in?

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:18.618
Then you'll know what the
spacing of the spots tells you.

00:18:18.618 --> 00:18:22.586
If you know the wavelength of
the X-rays, or of the light in

00:18:22.586 --> 00:18:26.420
this case, what does the spacing
of the spots tell you?

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.190
Student:  The spacing of
the plane that's-- --

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:33.498
Prof: It tells you what
the actual distance is between

00:18:33.498 --> 00:18:37.950
successive turns of the helix,
how far apart the planes are.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:42.098
So it tells the scale of the
helix, right?

00:18:42.098 --> 00:18:46.840
The angle you get from the X,
but how big the actual helix is

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.160
you get from the spacing of
those dots,

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.721
if you know the wavelength and
the distance that you're

00:18:53.721 --> 00:18:55.634
magnifying;
in the case of the

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:58.211
demonstration,
the distance from the slide at

00:18:58.211 --> 00:19:00.848
the back of the room to the
front of the room,

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:02.078
for seeing this.
 

00:19:02.078 --> 00:19:06.336
And the spots weaken
successively because of wire

00:19:06.336 --> 00:19:10.950
thickness, as we just explained,
as you go on out.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:15.545
Now, that looks very much like
Rosalind Franklin's B b-DNA

00:19:15.545 --> 00:19:17.400
photograph from 1952.
 

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:22.693
So we see the helix and we see
how angled the successive turns

00:19:22.693 --> 00:19:27.057
of the helix are,
what the pitch of the helix is,

00:19:27.057 --> 00:19:31.892
and from the spacing of the
dots we get how big the actual

00:19:31.892 --> 00:19:32.910
helix is.
 

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.920
But there's something funny.
 

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:41.380
The intensity doesn't just
evenly decease as you go out.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.851
Instead of being strong,
not quite as strong,

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:48.900
less strong,
weaker, very weak,

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.644
as you go out,
it goes weak,

00:19:51.644 --> 00:19:55.710
strong, strong,
very weak, strong.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:56.960
Now why is that?
 

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.368
Why do you get such a funny
pattern of intensities?

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:05.420
Let's look here at this thing
again.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.532
Remember where,
if we looked at the first,

00:20:07.532 --> 00:20:10.212
second, third and so on,
we saw that they come in and

00:20:10.212 --> 00:20:11.088
out of phase.
 

00:20:11.088 --> 00:20:13.440
But let's suppose-- -- so it
would be,

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.538
if you have things that are
twice as close together here,

00:20:16.538 --> 00:20:20.238
as in the first case,
what effect does that have on

00:20:20.238 --> 00:20:22.308
the actual pattern we see?
 

00:20:22.308 --> 00:20:25.868
The pattern we saw,
if we had only every other one,

00:20:25.868 --> 00:20:30.298
was here the direct beam,
first reflection,

00:20:30.298 --> 00:20:33.373
second reflection,
third reflection,

00:20:33.373 --> 00:20:35.130
fourth reflection.
 

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:41.690
How does it differ if we add
one in between?

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.980
Okay, here's the first
reflection-- -- can we see that,

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.808
if we have all three.
 

00:20:47.808 --> 00:20:51.214
That's what would've been the
first reflection if we didn't

00:20:51.214 --> 00:20:52.858
have the intermediate one.
 

00:20:52.858 --> 00:20:56.848
Do we see a reflection here,
if we have a whole row of them?

00:20:56.848 --> 00:20:59.059
No, because every other one
cancels out.

00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:00.509
So we won't see that one.
 

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:01.598
How about the next one?
 

00:21:01.598 --> 00:21:02.890
Student:  It'll be very
bright.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.813
Prof: Yes,
it'll be very bright,

00:21:04.813 --> 00:21:07.038
because there's more doing the
scattering.

00:21:07.038 --> 00:21:11.088
How about if we go to the next
one?

00:21:11.088 --> 00:21:13.549
No, nothing there,
cancelled, right?

00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:16.430
How about the next one?
 

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.740
Do you perceive a pattern
emerging?

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.920
What is it?
 

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.589
What?
 

00:21:22.589 --> 00:21:29.365
Student: It's successive;
you see it, then you don't see

00:21:29.365 --> 00:21:29.690
it.
 

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:32.869
Prof: Can you say it in
a more mathematical way?

00:21:32.869 --> 00:21:34.640
Suppose we numbered them.
 

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.078
The one straight ahead we'll
call zero;

00:21:37.078 --> 00:21:40.067
then there'll the first,
one, two, three,

00:21:40.067 --> 00:21:41.038
four, five.
 

00:21:41.038 --> 00:21:44.930
What happens when we put one in
between?

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.420
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.839
Prof: Is one there?
 

00:21:50.839 --> 00:21:53.460
This was one here, right?
 

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.680
There was one for the top and
bottom.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.470
Is that there?
 

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.140
Students:  No.
 

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:57.980
Prof: How about two?
 

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.869
Students:  Yes.
 

00:21:58.869 --> 00:21:59.869
Prof: How about three?
 

00:21:59.869 --> 00:22:00.569
Students:  No.
 

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:01.569
Prof: No.
 

00:22:01.569 --> 00:22:02.519
How about four?
 

00:22:02.519 --> 00:22:03.519
Students:  Yes.
 

00:22:03.519 --> 00:22:05.509
Prof: What's the-- --
can you state it mathematically?

00:22:05.509 --> 00:22:07.278
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another?&gt;&gt;

00:22:07.278 --> 00:22:08.788
Prof: Lexie,
what do you say?

00:22:08.788 --> 00:22:10.900
Student:
&gt;

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.009
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:22:12.009 --> 00:22:14.900
Student:  n+2?
 

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.250
Prof: Which ones
disappear?

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.410
Student: Odd.
 

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:18.858
Student:  The even.
 

00:22:18.858 --> 00:22:21.454
Prof: The odd ones,
one, three, five,

00:22:21.454 --> 00:22:23.871
seven, nine;
the odd ones disappear but the

00:22:23.871 --> 00:22:26.542
even ones are still there,
if we put an extra one in

00:22:26.542 --> 00:22:27.119
between.
 

00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:29.960
Now let's think about DNA.
 

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.589
Here's a helix, right?
 

00:22:32.589 --> 00:22:34.730
But what do you say about DNA?
 

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.009
Is it just a helix?
 

00:22:36.009 --> 00:22:37.108
Students:  Double helix.
 

00:22:37.108 --> 00:22:39.190
Prof: It's a double
helix, so there are two helices.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.317
Okay, so suppose we have-- --
there are the successive turns

00:22:42.317 --> 00:22:44.650
and we get scattering at a
certain angle--

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.880
-- but suppose we make a double
helix,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.470
now what'll happen?
 

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.400
Lexie, you're going to help me
again.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.240
Student: Oh.
 

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.190
Prof: How different will
it be if we have a second helix

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.740
wound halfway between the first
helix?

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.272
What will happen to the-- --
what we-- -- from one helix we

00:23:02.272 --> 00:23:03.796
had one, two,
three, four,

00:23:03.796 --> 00:23:05.989
five, six, seven,
eight, nine angles,

00:23:05.989 --> 00:23:06.720
right?
 

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.368
What happens now?
 

00:23:08.368 --> 00:23:09.640
Student: You're missing
even numbers.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.150
Prof: Can't hear.
 

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:11.410
Student:  You're missing
even numbers.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.038
Prof: Ah, !
 

00:23:12.038 --> 00:23:14.715
all the odd ones disappear.
 

00:23:14.715 --> 00:23:15.410
Right?
 

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.884
So what would you have expected
to see in Rosalind Franklin's

00:23:18.884 --> 00:23:19.637
picture then?
 

00:23:19.637 --> 00:23:20.160
Right?
 

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.733
It would be weak,
strong, weak,

00:23:22.733 --> 00:23:25.308
strong, weak,
strong, right?

00:23:25.308 --> 00:23:29.198
But generally getting weaker as
you go out because of the finite

00:23:29.198 --> 00:23:30.680
thickness of the wire.
 

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.328
Is that what we see?
 

00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:37.326
No, we saw-- -- the first one
is very weak,

00:23:37.326 --> 00:23:41.608
strong, strong,
very weak, strong.

00:23:41.608 --> 00:23:44.470
Can you see any-- -- how could
that be?

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.890
What is that telling you?
 

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:47.358
Yes?
 

00:23:47.358 --> 00:23:48.480
Student:  They're not
perfectly in-phase.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.670
Prof: What do you mean
they're not perfectly in-phase.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:54.410
Student:  They're not
equally-- --

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:55.430
Prof: Ah.
 

00:23:55.430 --> 00:24:00.144
Maybe the second one isn't
halfway between the turns of the

00:24:00.144 --> 00:24:00.958
first one.
 

00:24:00.958 --> 00:24:01.690
Right?
 

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.759
What happens?
 

00:24:03.759 --> 00:24:06.119
So the planes are twice as
close there and that would

00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:08.390
cancel every other reflection,
all the odd ones.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.118
But suppose it's like that.
 

00:24:11.118 --> 00:24:15.280
Did you ever see a situation
like that before where what

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.609
repeats is not a line but a pair
of lines?

00:24:18.609 --> 00:24:21.278
Angela?
 

00:24:21.278 --> 00:24:22.640
Student:  The second
diffraction-- .

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.992
Prof: The second
diffraction pattern we looked at

00:24:24.992 --> 00:24:28.153
was of that sort,
which showed the same dots but

00:24:28.153 --> 00:24:30.380
the intensity got modulated.
 

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.528
Remember?
 

00:24:32.528 --> 00:24:36.482
Okay, so let's,
instead of doing this where we

00:24:36.482 --> 00:24:41.314
have equally spaced ones,
let's do one where they're not

00:24:41.314 --> 00:24:43.950
equally spaced,
like this.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:48.059
Now-- -- oops,
it came loose here;

00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:53.990
here we go;
oh no;

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.440
there we go, okay.
 

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.521
Now consider the top and the
bottom one, which are in

00:25:00.521 --> 00:25:05.231
successive turns of the same
helix, and this one is offset in

00:25:05.231 --> 00:25:06.410
the middle.
 

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.769
But consider just the top and
the bottom one.

00:25:08.769 --> 00:25:11.180
Okay, there's the first
reflection, the second

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.482
reflection, the third
reflection, the fourth

00:25:13.482 --> 00:25:15.089
reflection, everybody see?
 

00:25:15.089 --> 00:25:16.970
Between the top and the bottom.
 

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:22.433
Now tell me what happens if I
add that other one offset this

00:25:22.433 --> 00:25:22.990
way.
 

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.669
How about the first reflection
there, is that going to be

00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:26.099
strong?
 

00:25:26.099 --> 00:25:27.440
Students:  No.
 

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.165
Prof: No,
because this one is canceling

00:25:30.165 --> 00:25:30.470
it.
 

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.276
And remember,
there's also one like this

00:25:33.276 --> 00:25:35.528
below this one;
remember, it's a really long

00:25:35.528 --> 00:25:36.298
row of these things.
 

00:25:36.298 --> 00:25:38.450
So it gets almost perfectly
cancelled;

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.720
not quite because it's not
quite-- --

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.558
there would be exactly the
minimum,

00:25:42.558 --> 00:25:44.808
and when the first and the
third are in-phase,

00:25:44.808 --> 00:25:47.210
the second one is not exactly
out-of-phase,

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.519
but very close;
very weak, that reflection's

00:25:49.519 --> 00:25:50.250
going to be.
 

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.487
Now let's go to what would be
the second reflection of the

00:25:53.487 --> 00:25:54.680
single helix there.
 

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.150
How about there?
 

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:57.529
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:59.207
Prof: Yes,
the second one now is helping

00:25:59.207 --> 00:26:01.378
out a little bit;
not perfectly but it's-- -- in

00:26:01.378 --> 00:26:04.435
fact, probably if we go just a
little bit further maybe it'd be

00:26:04.435 --> 00:26:04.930
better.
 

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.970
But anyhow there'd be a
reflection there.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:07.578
Okay?
 

00:26:07.578 --> 00:26:12.088
Now how about if we go to the
third?

00:26:12.088 --> 00:26:15.038
That's as good as the second
one, right?

00:26:15.038 --> 00:26:17.568
And how about if we go to the
fourth?

00:26:17.568 --> 00:26:19.715
Would the fourth-- -- if they
were evenly spaced,

00:26:19.715 --> 00:26:21.460
what would you expect for the
fourth?

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.190
Student:  Very strong.
 

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:23.549
Prof: Very strong, right?
 

00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:27.420
So let's go to the fourth;
one, two, three, four.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.640
What should it be?
 

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.440
Students:  Really weak.
 

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.720
Prof: Really weak.
 

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.109
And how about the fifth?
 

00:26:32.109 --> 00:26:34.369
Students:  Strong.
 

00:26:34.369 --> 00:26:35.890
Student:  Really strong.
 

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.939
Prof: That's precisely
what she saw,

00:26:37.939 --> 00:26:38.328
right?
 

00:26:38.328 --> 00:26:41.731
Weak, strong,
strong, very weak,

00:26:41.731 --> 00:26:42.720
strong.
 

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.496
So that's how much,
this is how much it's offset

00:26:46.496 --> 00:26:50.113
from the center,
in order to get that sequence

00:26:50.113 --> 00:26:51.640
of intensities.
 

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.940
Everybody with me on this?
 

00:26:53.940 --> 00:27:00.450
Okay.
 

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.098
So that's that repeated pair
pattern that we saw before.

00:27:03.098 --> 00:27:07.387
And there you see that the
outer coil of the DNA,

00:27:07.387 --> 00:27:12.034
which has phosphorous in it,
with a lot of electrons,

00:27:12.034 --> 00:27:15.338
that's very much like this
helix.

00:27:15.338 --> 00:27:18.200
Okay, much more electron
density near these planes than

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.160
between them,
than halfway between.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.970
But there's also much more
electron density on those,

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:26.440
near those blue planes than in
between,

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.200
for the same reason,
and that means that you get

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.278
those spots on the side.
 

00:27:32.278 --> 00:27:36.269
That tells you the diameter of
the helix.

00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:41.021
Okay, and the things top and
bottom tell you the base

00:27:41.021 --> 00:27:42.848
stacking distance.
 

00:27:42.848 --> 00:27:45.708
Let me back up just a second to
show you what we mean,

00:27:45.708 --> 00:27:46.140
right?
 

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.356
So there are a bunch of
electrons here,

00:27:48.356 --> 00:27:50.632
a bunch of electrons here,
a bunch here,

00:27:50.632 --> 00:27:53.023
a bunch here,
and that gives scattering in

00:27:53.023 --> 00:27:54.250
this direction.
 

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.480
So all that information-- --
the helix diameter,

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.000
the fact that it's a helix,
the fact that it's a double

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.020
helix,
the fact that it's an offset

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.273
double helix,
and the diameter of the

00:28:04.273 --> 00:28:07.670
cylinder, are all easily read
out if you know what you're

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.853
looking for;
which Crick knew,

00:28:09.853 --> 00:28:13.449
because he had been studying
helices of proteins,

00:28:13.449 --> 00:28:17.568
so he knew about-- -- he knew
from helix scattering.

00:28:17.568 --> 00:28:21.009
Okay, so knowing the molecule's
electron density,

00:28:21.009 --> 00:28:23.740
as we knew our artificial sort
of benzene,

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.329
or this DNA,
it's easy to calculate the

00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:29.558
crystal's diffraction pattern,
especially if you have a

00:28:29.558 --> 00:28:32.529
computer to help you out;
but it's not an intellectual

00:28:32.529 --> 00:28:34.304
challenge, it's just work.
 

00:28:34.304 --> 00:28:34.848
Right?
 

00:28:34.848 --> 00:28:38.385
Using pretty heavy- duty math,
people got the Nobel Prize for

00:28:38.385 --> 00:28:40.976
developing it;
or a canned program,

00:28:40.976 --> 00:28:44.680
(that's what they got the Nobel
Prize for),

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.402
you can go the other way and go
from the X-ray pattern to what

00:28:48.402 --> 00:28:50.049
it was that was causing it.
 

00:28:50.049 --> 00:28:50.598
Right?
 

00:28:50.598 --> 00:28:53.617
What we did was go from what's
causing it to the pattern,

00:28:53.617 --> 00:28:56.635
but in fact you can go the
other way now when you press a

00:28:56.635 --> 00:28:57.930
button on a machine.
 

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:05.278
And you get out the electron
density at every point in space.

00:29:05.278 --> 00:29:08.390
Okay, that's the yield from an
X-ray structure.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.009
Why don't you get the nuclear
positions, why do you get the

00:29:12.009 --> 00:29:13.318
electron positions?
 

00:29:13.318 --> 00:29:15.869
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:29:15.869 --> 00:29:17.319
Prof: Alex?
 

00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:18.038
Can't hear.
 

00:29:18.038 --> 00:29:19.279
Student:  It's too big
to diffract.

00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:20.840
Prof: Yes,
it's too heavy,

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.865
so it doesn't vibrate,
the nuclei, so they don't

00:29:23.865 --> 00:29:26.724
function as an antenna,
to give off the new waves the

00:29:26.724 --> 00:29:27.828
way the electrons do.
 

00:29:27.828 --> 00:29:31.130
Okay, so you get a result,
which you can plot on a map.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.617
Now in the olden days when I
started doing this kind of

00:29:34.617 --> 00:29:37.556
thing,
the kind of map you got out was

00:29:37.556 --> 00:29:40.519
a big sheet of computer output
paper,

00:29:40.519 --> 00:29:44.255
and it had numbers on it,
and a given piece of paper was

00:29:44.255 --> 00:29:47.380
a given slice through the
"unit cell',

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.184
through the pattern,
and numbers were printed out

00:29:50.184 --> 00:29:53.866
that said what was the electron
density at that particular point

00:29:53.866 --> 00:29:54.920
on that level.
 

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.298
So you had an x axis,
y axis, and at this point it

00:29:58.298 --> 00:30:00.987
was seventy-five,
forty-two, fifty-five,

00:30:00.987 --> 00:30:03.675
eighty-seven,
or whatever the number is,

00:30:03.675 --> 00:30:04.778
and so on.
 

00:30:04.778 --> 00:30:09.296
And what you do is take a felt
tip pen and connect dots of

00:30:09.296 --> 00:30:13.496
equal size, and you'd get a
contour of that particular

00:30:13.496 --> 00:30:15.160
electron density.
 

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.910
And here's where that was done
for a particular compound.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.843
This is taken from a book
written at that time by Stout

00:30:21.843 --> 00:30:22.548
and Jensen.
 

00:30:22.548 --> 00:30:24.766
And you drew these by hands
because you didn't have a

00:30:24.766 --> 00:30:27.281
computer that could draw-- --
that could figure out where to

00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:28.220
draw it and so on.
 

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:32.740
So here were atoms in a
particular crystal structure.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.949
Then you had a whole bunch of
sheets of paper for different

00:30:36.949 --> 00:30:39.779
slices, through the electron
density;

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:41.930
stack them up, right?
 

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.970
Now sometimes the particular
slice you're working in went

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:48.009
right through the middle of an
atom, so you got very high

00:30:48.009 --> 00:30:49.150
electron density.
 

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.509
Sometime it just barely touched
the atom, right?

00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:57.326
So you see here that that one,
that atom, this particular

00:30:57.326 --> 00:31:01.142
slice, was very near the
nucleus, so we got high electron

00:31:01.142 --> 00:31:01.960
density.
 

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.388
But that one,
the nucleus was not in this

00:31:04.388 --> 00:31:07.670
plane, so you just got a little
glancing blow at it.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:08.278
Okay?
 

00:31:08.278 --> 00:31:13.239
But you could draw these things
on acetate or plastic sheets and

00:31:13.239 --> 00:31:15.048
stack them up,
right?

00:31:15.048 --> 00:31:19.367
So this was the model made for
the first determination of the

00:31:19.367 --> 00:31:25.481
structure of penicillin;
in fact, the potassium salt of

00:31:25.481 --> 00:31:27.180
penicillin.
 

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.990
Where's the potassium atom?
 

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:34.154
How can you distinguish
potassium from nitrogen or

00:31:34.154 --> 00:31:36.788
carbon or hydrogen or oxygen?
 

00:31:36.788 --> 00:31:37.588
Student:  Electron
density.

00:31:37.588 --> 00:31:41.410
Prof: It'll have a lot
more electron density.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:42.720
So do you see it?
 

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.440
There's the potassium,
lots of density.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:51.230
Okay, now here's a molecule
that happened to be flat.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:55.438
So it was possible to slice
through practically all the

00:31:55.438 --> 00:31:56.140
nuclei.
 

00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:00.403
It's not a very common type of
molecule, but this one is,

00:32:00.403 --> 00:32:01.470
rubofusarin.
 

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:05.162
Okay, now these contours are
drawn at intervals of one

00:32:05.162 --> 00:32:07.113
electron per cubic angstrom.
 

00:32:07.113 --> 00:32:07.740
Right?
 

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.250
So the first one is one
electron per cubic angstrom,

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.810
two electrons per cubic
angstrom, three electrons per

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:14.240
cubic angstrom and so on.
 

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:18.730
Now there are both carbons and
oxygens in this.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.568
How can you tell which ones are
oxygens?

00:32:21.568 --> 00:32:24.549
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:25.440
Prof: Yeah, Yoounjoou?
 

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.167
Student:  They are more
electronegative,

00:32:27.167 --> 00:32:28.710
so they should have more
contour lines.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.618
Prof: They should have
more contour lines.

00:32:30.618 --> 00:32:33.393
So if we look here,
we see that that one goes up to

00:32:33.393 --> 00:32:35.390
five electrons per cubic
angstrom;

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:37.916
one, two, three,
four, five rings,

00:32:37.916 --> 00:32:38.529
right?
 

00:32:38.529 --> 00:32:42.493
That one goes up to seven
electrons per cubic angstrom,

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:43.669
and so do those.
 

00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:44.329
Right?
 

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:47.819
So those are the oxygens.
 

00:32:47.819 --> 00:32:48.490
Okay?
 

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:51.896
And there's a picture of the
structure and you see indeed

00:32:51.896 --> 00:32:53.480
those atoms are oxygens.
 

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:59.769
Now, what is our fundamental
goal of looking at this stuff,

00:32:59.769 --> 00:33:02.480
what do we want to see?
 

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.299
Students:  Bonds.
 

00:33:03.299 --> 00:33:03.980
Prof: Bonds.
 

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.059
Do you see bonds?
 

00:33:05.059 --> 00:33:07.798
What does it look like?
 

00:33:07.798 --> 00:33:12.220
It looks like just a bunch of
balls, just atoms put there.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.420
Was Lewis right?
 

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.851
Are there electron pairs
halfway between the bonded

00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:20.559
atoms?
 

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:25.630
No, it's just atoms.
 

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:26.950
Okay.
 

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:30.190
Why are there no hydrogens?
 

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.058
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:33:32.058 --> 00:33:34.267
Prof: Because they have
hardly any electrons compared to

00:33:34.267 --> 00:33:34.980
the others, right?
 

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.319
So they're a very weak thing.
 

00:33:38.319 --> 00:33:41.059
Okay, now those are bonds.
 

00:33:41.059 --> 00:33:43.009
You can see them there.
 

00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:44.710
Where did those lines come from?
 

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:47.608
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another?&gt;&gt;

00:33:47.608 --> 00:33:48.650
Prof: Angela,
what did you say?

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.109
Student:  Someone drew
them.

00:33:50.109 --> 00:33:51.009
Prof: Yes, you drew them.
 

00:33:51.009 --> 00:33:53.240
How did you know where to draw
the bonds?

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.660
Student:  You connect
the dots.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.161
Prof: You connect the
centers of the rings,

00:33:57.161 --> 00:33:57.569
right?
 

00:33:57.569 --> 00:33:58.538
Those are the bonds.
 

00:33:58.538 --> 00:34:01.134
Now how do you know what's a
single bond, what's a double

00:34:01.134 --> 00:34:02.480
bond, what's a triple bond?
 

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.750
Student: More density?
 

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.019
Prof: You notice in the
structure here,

00:34:08.019 --> 00:34:10.342
on the bottom right,
there are double bonds and

00:34:10.342 --> 00:34:11.199
single bonds.
 

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:13.030
How do I know which is which?
 

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.760
Is there any way of knowing?
 

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.199
Elizabeth?
 

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:15.230
Student:  Maybe the
distance between.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.340
Prof: Ah, the distance!
 

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.550
Double bonds should be shorter
than single bonds.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:22.916
And, in fact,
notice that here we have short,

00:34:22.916 --> 00:34:25.300
long and intermediate.
 

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.219
Why intermediate?
 

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:30.789
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:34:30.789 --> 00:34:34.340
Prof: Why do I draw a
dotted line there?

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.659
Student: 
&gt;

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:40.739
Prof: Because we have
this, look here;

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:42.780
resonance, right?
 

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.840
So there are one- and- a- half
bonds.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.989
Right?
 

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:53.739
Okay, but fundamentally what we
see are spherical atoms,

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:54.429
right?
 

00:34:54.429 --> 00:35:02.000
No bonds, no unshared pairs on
oxygen, just atoms.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.340
So was Lewis way off base?
 

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:10.695
Actually you can see the bonds
with X-ray, but you don't look

00:35:10.695 --> 00:35:14.760
at total electron density the
way we're looking at it.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.210
What you look at is difference
density;

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:23.224
you see how different is
the picture I actually determine

00:35:23.224 --> 00:35:27.922
from what I would've expected if
they were truly just

00:35:27.922 --> 00:35:30.550
spherical atoms,
undistorted.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:37.170
How do you find-- -- how would
you make such a map?

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:40.164
So you have these pieces of
paper that say how much the

00:35:40.164 --> 00:35:43.050
electron density would be at all
different points;

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.150
experimentally,
how much it is experimentally.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:49.273
Now I want to see how different
is that from if I just had

00:35:49.273 --> 00:35:50.590
spheres for the atoms.
 

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.070
What would I do?
 

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.853
I have to find out what the
spheres would look like,

00:35:55.853 --> 00:35:59.182
what density they would predict
at all these different points,

00:35:59.182 --> 00:36:00.329
and then do what?
 

00:36:00.329 --> 00:36:01.210
Student:  Subtract.
 

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:04.219
Prof: Subtract, right?
 

00:36:04.219 --> 00:36:06.260
So that's the difference
density.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.119
Sometimes it's called
deformation because it's

00:36:10.119 --> 00:36:13.978
how much the electron
distribution gets deformed when

00:36:13.978 --> 00:36:15.389
bonds get made.
 

00:36:15.389 --> 00:36:17.980
Okay, so you take the observed
electron density,

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.550
which is from X-ray,
which is experimental,

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.949
and you subtract atomic
electron density,

00:36:21.949 --> 00:36:23.969
which you calculate somehow.
 

00:36:23.969 --> 00:36:26.289
You know what spherical atoms
would look like;

00:36:26.289 --> 00:36:29.186
we'll get to that next,
how you would know what that

00:36:29.186 --> 00:36:29.469
is.
 

00:36:29.469 --> 00:36:31.210
But anyhow, how do you know
where to--

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:33.641
-- when you're going to do the
subtraction you have to make

00:36:33.641 --> 00:36:35.320
sure you position the atoms
properly,

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.320
to be subtracted, right?
 

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.119
How do you know where to put
them?

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:42.463
How do you know where to put
your spherical atoms so that you

00:36:42.463 --> 00:36:43.010
subtract it?
 

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:43.670
Yes?
 

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.159
Student:  On the center
of the rings.

00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:48.505
Prof: You put it on the
center of those rings,

00:36:48.505 --> 00:36:49.018
right?
 

00:36:49.018 --> 00:36:51.119
Okay, so let's look at a case
like this.

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:55.719
This was done by Leiserowitz
and Ziva Berkovitch-Yellin

00:36:55.719 --> 00:36:57.849
thirty-three years ago.
 

00:36:57.849 --> 00:37:01.603
So this is an interesting
molecule because it has lots of

00:37:01.603 --> 00:37:04.820
different kinds of bonds in it:
single bonds,

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.940
double bonds-- -- in fact three
double bonds in a row--

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:12.090
-- and also benzene rings that
have these resonance bonds.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:15.057
Okay, so we're going to look
first at one of the benzene

00:37:15.057 --> 00:37:15.489
rings.
 

00:37:15.489 --> 00:37:15.969
Okay?
 

00:37:15.969 --> 00:37:20.487
So this map that I'm showing
you here is a difference density

00:37:20.487 --> 00:37:20.940
map.
 

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.282
It's the total,
minus what it would be for the

00:37:23.282 --> 00:37:23.699
atoms.
 

00:37:23.699 --> 00:37:27.849
But notice what was subtracted
is just the carbon density;

00:37:27.849 --> 00:37:30.429
didn't subtract hydrogens.
 

00:37:30.429 --> 00:37:32.699
So let's look at the features
that are big here.

00:37:32.699 --> 00:37:36.159
This is how the electron
density changed in forming the

00:37:36.159 --> 00:37:37.570
molecule from atoms.
 

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:38.469
Okay?
 

00:37:38.469 --> 00:37:39.768
So first look up there.
 

00:37:39.768 --> 00:37:43.240
There are some very dense
contours, right in the middle up

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.590
there, and that's the hydrogen
which was not subtracted,

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:47.199
right?
 

00:37:47.199 --> 00:37:51.541
So it's the biggest game left
in town, once you've subtracted

00:37:51.541 --> 00:37:53.280
the spherical carbons.
 

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:58.945
Okay, so that's-- -- and the
total amount of intensity in

00:37:58.945 --> 00:38:04.610
that region is one electron,
which is what you expect.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:08.121
Now the total amount of
deformation density in this

00:38:08.121 --> 00:38:11.561
region, where there's a single
carbon-carbon bond,

00:38:11.561 --> 00:38:13.949
is only 1/10th of an electron.
 

00:38:13.949 --> 00:38:17.079
What would Lewis have said?
 

00:38:17.079 --> 00:38:19.849
Two electrons,
it's 1/10th of an electron.

00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:23.820
Okay, now let's slice that-- --
and within the carbon-carbon

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.242
bonds of the ring,
the aromatic ones,

00:38:26.242 --> 00:38:27.320
it's bigger.
 

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.300
Why bigger?
 

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.599
Because it's partially double
bond in the resonance

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:32.518
structures, right?
 

00:38:32.518 --> 00:38:35.420
Okay, so it's 0.2 electrons for
those ones in the ring.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:41.590
Now let's slice it and turn it
so we can see its cross-section.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.630
And it's round;
no surprise there.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:52.840
But let's slice the ones in the
ring and turn them.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.119
It's oval, not round,
the bonds are not round.

00:38:57.119 --> 00:38:58.590
Why?
 

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:01.389
Students: Ï€ bonds.
 

00:39:01.389 --> 00:39:03.608
Prof: Ah,
because they're partially made

00:39:03.608 --> 00:39:06.356
up of these p orbitals
that point in and out of the

00:39:06.356 --> 00:39:08.880
ring,
that distort it from being

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.429
round.
 

00:39:09.429 --> 00:39:13.052
Okay, now let's look at the
double bonds that are in the

00:39:13.052 --> 00:39:15.159
middle of this molecule,
okay?

00:39:15.159 --> 00:39:17.681
First that one;
we've already seen that bond

00:39:17.681 --> 00:39:20.719
before that was 0.1,
had a round cross-section.

00:39:20.719 --> 00:39:23.099
But let's look at one of the
double bonds.

00:39:23.099 --> 00:39:27.318
Not too surprisingly it has
more electron deformation

00:39:27.318 --> 00:39:29.590
density in it;
0.2, right?

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:33.480
And the one in the middle
actually has 0.3.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:38.074
Now they're both double bonds,
so probably they look similar,

00:39:38.074 --> 00:39:39.989
and in a sense they do.
 

00:39:39.989 --> 00:39:42.492
If we slice the first one,
and turn it,

00:39:42.492 --> 00:39:45.260
it's oval for the same reason
as before;

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.610
there's a p orbital pointing in
and out of the board,

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:52.282
and if we look at it below,
part of the bond is caused by

00:39:52.282 --> 00:39:53.715
overlapping,
as we'll see,

00:39:53.715 --> 00:39:55.260
of those p orbitals.
 

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.219
So it's got an oval,
up and down shape.

00:39:58.219 --> 00:40:00.530
How about the next one?
 

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:06.387
If we slice it and turn it,
it's also oval in

00:40:06.387 --> 00:40:10.648
cross-section,
but perpendicular.

00:40:10.648 --> 00:40:11.980
Right?
 

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.110
What do you expect the next one
would look like?

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.510
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.547
Prof: It's symmetrical;
it'll look like the first one

00:40:18.547 --> 00:40:18.889
again.
 

00:40:18.889 --> 00:40:20.730
But here's something
interesting.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:24.179
That cross-section of the
middle one showed the

00:40:24.179 --> 00:40:28.905
deformation due to the pink but
not the deformation showing-- --

00:40:28.905 --> 00:40:31.829
due to those neighboring blue
ones.

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:34.722
There must be something
different about the interaction

00:40:34.722 --> 00:40:37.239
at the end and the interaction
in the middle.

00:40:37.239 --> 00:40:39.940
Does everybody see that problem?
 

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.889
You might think the middle one
would be round or clover-leaf

00:40:43.889 --> 00:40:47.302
shaped, but it's not,
it's distorted in the in-plane

00:40:47.302 --> 00:40:48.239
direction.
 

00:40:48.239 --> 00:40:51.128
But to understand this,
you have to be patient and wait

00:40:51.128 --> 00:40:52.947
till next week,
or later this week,

00:40:52.947 --> 00:40:55.570
when we start getting into
quantum mechanics.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:41:01.309
But notice that it's as if the
carbons formed bent bonds.

00:41:01.309 --> 00:41:07.411
So the bonds from those central
carbons at the end go up and

00:41:07.411 --> 00:41:12.480
down, but the ones in the middle
are in- plane.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.340
Now how many electrons are
there in a bond?

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:18.675
So here we're going to plot how
many electrons vertically,

00:41:18.675 --> 00:41:21.717
and how long the bond is,
which is related to whether

00:41:21.717 --> 00:41:23.590
it's single, double,
triple.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:28.016
In fact, a single bond is there;
a double bond and a triple bond

00:41:28.016 --> 00:41:29.739
have those distances.
 

00:41:29.739 --> 00:41:34.213
Now if you-- -- and in fact you
could also do a one-and-a- and a

00:41:34.213 --> 00:41:37.409
half bond, those bonds in the
benzene ring.

00:41:37.409 --> 00:41:40.300
Now what would you expect this
to be?

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.625
How many electrons-- -- if you
were Lewis, how many electrons

00:41:43.625 --> 00:41:45.510
would you have in a single bond?
 

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.150
Students:  Two.
 

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.920
Prof: Two.
 

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.639
Double bond?
 

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:50.369
Students:  Four
Prof: Four.

00:41:50.369 --> 00:41:51.119
Students:  Six.
 

00:41:51.119 --> 00:41:52.070
Prof: Six.
 

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:52.789
Students:  Three.
 

00:41:52.789 --> 00:41:55.559
Prof: Three,
okay one and a -and-a-half.

00:41:55.559 --> 00:41:58.360
Okay, so there's what you would
expect for the plot,

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.809
if Lewis was right:;
two, four, six.

00:42:01.809 --> 00:42:02.429
Okay?
 

00:42:02.429 --> 00:42:06.407
Now we can take this molecule
that we just looked at and see

00:42:06.407 --> 00:42:10.518
how much electron density there
is in each of those bonds--

00:42:10.518 --> 00:42:15.505
-- and I've color-coded it-- --
and it looks pretty darn good.

00:42:15.505 --> 00:42:16.159
Right?
 

00:42:16.159 --> 00:42:18.710
Hooray for Lewis.
 

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:20.960
And in fact the people who did
the work,

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.797
Leiserowitz and
Berkovitch-Yellin,

00:42:22.797 --> 00:42:25.914
looked at a bunch of other
structures too and added those

00:42:25.914 --> 00:42:29.407
to the same plot,
and they're not bad,

00:42:29.407 --> 00:42:32.469
except the scale is wrong.
 

00:42:32.469 --> 00:42:39.154
Instead of being two,
four, six,, which I've faded

00:42:39.154 --> 00:42:43.110
out here, it's 0.1,0.2,0.3.
 

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:47.309
So bonds are a very minor game
in the distribution of

00:42:47.309 --> 00:42:48.280
electrons.
 

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.356
Lewis, in a sense,
was sort of right,

00:42:50.356 --> 00:42:53.298
there is electron
density shifted between the

00:42:53.298 --> 00:42:55.550
atoms to hold them together,
right?

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:58.210
But much less than pairs of
electrons.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:02.903
In fact, this amount of bonding
density is about 1/20th of what

00:43:02.903 --> 00:43:05.931
Lewis might have said,
but never did say,

00:43:05.931 --> 00:43:08.809
because he wasn't that
naïve.

00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:10.130
Okay?
 

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:14.547
So instead of getting two,
you get a 20th of two;

00:43:14.547 --> 00:43:15.099
0.1.
 

00:43:15.099 --> 00:43:15.829
Okay?
 

00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:18.320
So bonding density is about
1/20th of a Lewis.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.545
Incidentally,
the unit "Lewis"

00:43:20.545 --> 00:43:22.429
is used only within this class.
 

00:43:22.429 --> 00:43:24.199
Okay?
 

00:43:24.199 --> 00:43:27.559
So here's another example done
by Dunitz in Switzerland and

00:43:27.559 --> 00:43:31.614
these people who were the--
-- Schuyler Seiler and

00:43:31.614 --> 00:43:35.952
Schweizer, who were Swiss,
who were the progeny of

00:43:35.952 --> 00:43:38.809
watchmakers and people that do
very precise work;

00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:42.199
because to do this you have to
have really precise

00:43:42.199 --> 00:43:44.817
experimental work,
if you're going to subtract

00:43:44.817 --> 00:43:47.561
something from something else
and have the difference be

00:43:47.561 --> 00:43:49.929
meaningful,
when the numbers are almost

00:43:49.929 --> 00:43:51.550
precisely the same,
right?

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:53.159
Remember we looked at the total
electron density.

00:43:53.159 --> 00:43:54.800
It looked just like spheres.
 

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.552
So you have to be really good
with this if you want to have

00:43:57.552 --> 00:44:00.610
this be meaningful;
and those guys were really good.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:03.768
This was done,
what, twenty-five years ago.

00:44:03.768 --> 00:44:06.297
So they took this molecule,
which is highly symmetric,

00:44:06.297 --> 00:44:07.110
which is great.
 

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:11.121
Remember it's got its resonance
structure, so all the bonds

00:44:11.121 --> 00:44:14.510
around the middle are the same,
top and bottom.

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:17.648
Okay, so we need only look at a
quarter of the molecule,

00:44:17.648 --> 00:44:20.730
or for convenience a little bit
more than a quarter.

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:22.929
So I'll blow it up here.
 

00:44:22.929 --> 00:44:26.030
And there is the electron
difference density.

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:30.503
So this is how the electrons
shifted during formation of the

00:44:30.503 --> 00:44:31.110
bonds.
 

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:34.219
Okay, so there's a
carbon-carbon aromatic bond,

00:44:34.219 --> 00:44:36.405
a bond and a half,
and if you turn it and look at

00:44:36.405 --> 00:44:38.099
it,
it's distorted the way you

00:44:38.099 --> 00:44:41.380
expect, just as in the previous
experiment we talked about.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.510
Here's another one, same deal.
 

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:47.820
Now here is a single bond,
carbon-carbon single bond.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.139
What's it going to look like in
cross-section?

00:44:51.139 --> 00:44:54.579
Prof: Round. Good.
 

00:44:54.579 --> 00:44:58.079
Now here is a carbon-nitrogen
triple bond.

00:44:58.079 --> 00:44:59.219
This is something new.
 

00:44:59.219 --> 00:45:05.429
What's it going to look like in
cross-section?

00:45:05.429 --> 00:45:11.199
Maybe like a clover-leaf, huh?
 

00:45:11.199 --> 00:45:16.469
Like that, it looks like that.
 

00:45:16.469 --> 00:45:17.570
It's round.
 

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:21.702
It's not clover-leaf,
and it's not a diamond,

00:45:21.702 --> 00:45:24.519
it's round in cross-section.
 

00:45:24.519 --> 00:45:25.590
So we'll address that later.
 

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:26.409
What's that?
 

00:45:26.409 --> 00:45:28.190
That's not a bond.
 

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:29.489
Students:  Unshared pair.
 

00:45:29.489 --> 00:45:36.320
Prof: That's the
unshared pair on Nitrogen.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.619
Now what's special here?
 

00:45:38.619 --> 00:45:41.309
What are we looking at?
 

00:45:41.309 --> 00:45:44.610
We're looking at the
carbon-fluorine bond.

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.693
Does it look like the
carbon-carbon bonds,

00:45:46.693 --> 00:45:47.760
or carbon-nitrogen?
 

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.710
How's it different?
 

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:53.190
There's no there, there. Right?
 

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:56.530
There aren't any electrons
holding carbon to fluorine.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:59.190
What the heck is going on?
 

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:03.239
Where is the C-F bond?
 

00:46:03.239 --> 00:46:05.989
This brings up the second great
question in the course.

00:46:05.989 --> 00:46:07.639
What's the first question?
 

00:46:07.639 --> 00:46:08.420
Students:
 How do you know?

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.018
Prof: How do you
know, right?

00:46:10.018 --> 00:46:16.340
And the second question is
illustrated by this film clip.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:39.860
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:45.880
Come on baby.
 

00:46:45.880 --> 00:47:03.500
I worked hard on this.
 

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.119
Okay, I'll tell you what it
says.

00:47:05.119 --> 00:47:11.719
&gt;
 

00:47:11.719 --> 00:47:24.320
&lt;&lt;Technical
Adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:27.610
Prof: Okay,
I can do it myself.

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:30.239
(This is a disaster.)
 

00:47:30.239 --> 00:47:33.423
"Catch some thieves
Hobson, that's what we're here

00:47:33.423 --> 00:47:35.722
for." 
"Very well sir."

00:47:35.722 --> 00:47:36.697
Click, click,

00:47:36.697 --> 00:47:37.849
click, click,
click, click,

00:47:37.849 --> 00:47:39.179
click, click,
click, click.

00:47:39.179 --> 00:47:45.556
&gt; 
"What do you think of

00:47:45.556 --> 00:47:47.478
him?" 
"Compared with what

00:47:47.478 --> 00:47:50.250
sir?" 
"Exactly." 

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:52.480
Okay.
 

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.780
&lt;&lt;Laughter and
applause&gt;&gt;

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.780
"What do you think of
him?"

00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:00.409
"Compared with what
sir?"

00:48:00.409 --> 00:48:01.840
"Exactly."
 

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.697
That's the second question,
compared with what? In

00:48:05.697 --> 00:48:08.851
anything quantitative,
even many qualitative things,

00:48:08.851 --> 00:48:11.407
that's the question,
and that's why we're in

00:48:11.407 --> 00:48:13.960
problems here looking for the
C-F bond.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.610
We already saw this question
when we talked about resonance.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:22.900
Remember, I asserted that when
you have resonance the molecule

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.809
is unusually stable.
 

00:48:24.809 --> 00:48:26.639
What should you have asked?
 

00:48:26.639 --> 00:48:27.268
Student:  Compared to
what?

00:48:27.268 --> 00:48:29.288
Prof: Compared to what?
 

00:48:29.288 --> 00:48:29.760
Right?
 

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.802
In that case it turns out it's
compared to observed or

00:48:33.802 --> 00:48:35.329
calculated energy.
 

00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:37.978
Compare the observed or
calculated energy,

00:48:37.978 --> 00:48:41.338
(what really happens),
to what you would expect if it

00:48:41.338 --> 00:48:42.760
were not resonant.
 

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.126
And we'll talk later about how,
on what basis,

00:48:46.126 --> 00:48:48.518
you might have an expectation.
 

00:48:48.518 --> 00:48:51.639
Now we're talking about
difference electron density.

00:48:51.639 --> 00:48:54.530
So what do we compare?
 

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:56.320
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.949
Prof: We compare
experimental electron density,

00:48:58.949 --> 00:49:03.306
(or it could be calculated,
if we can use quantum mechanics

00:49:03.306 --> 00:49:06.275
to calculate it)--
, but compare experimental

00:49:06.275 --> 00:49:07.739
electron density to what?
 

00:49:07.739 --> 00:49:09.449
What have we compared it to?
 

00:49:09.449 --> 00:49:10.623
Student: 
&gt;

00:49:10.623 --> 00:49:12.387
Prof: What it would be

00:49:12.387 --> 00:49:13.583
if it were just atoms.
 

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:14.019
Right?
 

00:49:14.019 --> 00:49:17.239
But what kind of atoms, right?
 

00:49:17.239 --> 00:49:20.581
We compare the observed or
calculated total electron

00:49:20.581 --> 00:49:23.987
density to the sum of electron
densities for a set of

00:49:23.987 --> 00:49:25.429
undistorted atoms.
 

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:29.329
Now what's an undistorted atom?
 

00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:32.179
Okay.
 

00:49:32.179 --> 00:49:35.942
Now, to avoid Pauli problems--
-- and this isn't the time to

00:49:35.942 --> 00:49:40.199
discuss what those are,
we need to subtract not an

00:49:40.199 --> 00:49:43.699
unbiased spherical fluorine
atom,

00:49:43.699 --> 00:49:47.780
which if you count up how many
electrons there are on fluorine,

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.409
each quadrant of space around
fluorine--

00:49:50.409 --> 00:49:52.860
-- of which there will be
four-- --

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:56.791
each quadrant will have one and
three three-quarters electrons

00:49:56.791 --> 00:49:57.179
in it.
 

00:49:57.179 --> 00:49:57.760
Right?
 

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.898
You multiply that by four and
you get seven electrons,

00:50:01.898 --> 00:50:05.960
which is the valence electrons
of fluorine, right?

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:11.510
But you can't have one and
three three-quarters electrons

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:15.375
from fluorine,
and also an electron from

00:50:15.375 --> 00:50:18.250
carbon in the same place.
 

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:21.402
That's too many electrons in
the same place,

00:50:21.402 --> 00:50:21.989
right?
 

00:50:21.989 --> 00:50:25.797
So what you have to start with
is not an undistorted spherical

00:50:25.797 --> 00:50:28.994
fluorine atom,
but a fluorine atom that's

00:50:28.994 --> 00:50:32.592
prepared to make a bond,
which has only one electron in

00:50:32.592 --> 00:50:34.739
the region where it's going to
make a bond.

00:50:34.739 --> 00:50:39.393
So if you subtract a spherical
one, you're subtracting too much

00:50:39.393 --> 00:50:42.170
from the region of the bond,
right?

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:45.539
So that's why you don't see any
electron density in there.

00:50:45.539 --> 00:50:48.485
So, and if you want to
understand this better than I've

00:50:48.485 --> 00:50:50.559
explained it,
go on the Web and look at

00:50:50.559 --> 00:50:52.469
Professor Dunitz explaining it.
 

00:50:52.469 --> 00:50:55.940
We have a little movie of him
talking about this particular

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:56.539
problem.
 

00:50:56.539 --> 00:50:57.010
Okay?
 

00:50:57.010 --> 00:51:01.697
But at any rate the conclusion
of all this is that bonding

00:51:01.697 --> 00:51:04.739
density is about 1/20th of a
Lewis.

00:51:04.739 --> 00:51:05.909
All right?
 

00:51:05.909 --> 00:51:07.239
And it's time for me to quit.
 

00:51:07.239 --> 00:51:09.800
We'll go on with this next time.

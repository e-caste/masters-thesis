00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.210
I want to continue talking
about property rights today.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.631
And I'm going to also address
most of the lecture to the

00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:11.550
problem of takings and when the
government has the right to take

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.220
private property for public
purposes and under what kinds of

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.020
circumstances compensation is
required.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.860
You recall the Fifth Amendment
of the Constitution,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.445
that private property can't be
taken without compensation if

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:27.120
it's going to be used for public
purposes.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.200
Before we get there,
I want you to think about the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.029
way that property rights are
fractured by law,

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:35.670
but also by jurisdictional
boundaries.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.541
And I wanted to just spend a
moment to give you a sense of

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:43.548
the kinds of problems that are
experienced out in Wyoming in

00:00:43.548 --> 00:00:47.283
the northwestern corner known as
the greater Yellowstone

00:00:47.283 --> 00:00:48.370
ecosystem.
 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.020
And this is an extraordinary
area.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.524
It's one of the last great
tracts of forest lands in the

00:00:55.524 --> 00:00:57.080
northern Rockies.
 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.073
And it also is a habitat to a
variety of large mammals,

00:01:01.073 --> 00:01:04.400
many of which are either
threatened or rare or

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.510
endangered.
 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.974
And the jurisdictional
boundaries are really

00:01:07.974 --> 00:01:10.438
complicated and I think very
interesting.

00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:14.218
There are several national
parks: the Yellowstone National

00:01:14.218 --> 00:01:17.506
Park,
also the national forests,

00:01:17.506 --> 00:01:21.110
the Grand Teton National
Forest,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.799
several other national wildlife
refuges are also in this area.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.605
Several Native American
reservations are in this area as

00:01:31.605 --> 00:01:32.090
well.
 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.381
And what you see on the right
hand side of this slide is just

00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:40.101
one example of one species of
wolves that cross these

00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:41.890
different boundaries.
 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.788
So the purpose of this chart is
to give you a sense that there

00:01:45.788 --> 00:01:49.047
are a wide number of laws that
are at play that give

00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:52.370
implementation authority to
different agencies,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.830
such as the Forest Service,
the Bureau of Land Management,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.640
the National Park Service,
the Fish and Wildlife Service,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.129
and also complimentary state
agencies.

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:08.603
And there are also a large set
of private landowners that own

00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:10.610
huge tracts of land.
 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.110
So that it's a mixture of
public and private rights that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.527
have a complexity that often
does not fare well for the

00:02:19.527 --> 00:02:22.310
natural resources in the area.
 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.593
And the area is also rich in
natural gas as well as oil

00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:30.800
reserves that create some other
types of conflicts.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.533
So timber harvesting,
oil extraction,

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:36.193
water rights,
all of these different

00:02:36.193 --> 00:02:39.840
resources need to be managed
very carefully.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.622
And the central problem
represented by this map is that

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:50.428
certain kinds of resources,
such as wolves or grizzly bears

00:02:50.428 --> 00:02:54.834
or complexes of species,
transcend these jurisdictional

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:55.538
boundaries.
 

00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:59.272
And the Forest Service may have
a very different policy than the

00:02:59.272 --> 00:03:02.770
National Park Service in
determining how they're managed.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.155
So the same species of unusual
timber might exist on Forest

00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:09.354
Service land,
and the Forest Service may be

00:03:09.354 --> 00:03:13.568
giving out leases to extract
those timber resources,

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.330
whereas the Park Service would
not do so.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.229
And I mentioned the problem of
fire crossing these

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.419
jurisdictional boundaries as
well,

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.195
and having the Forest Service
have a policy of fire

00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:25.175
suppression,
as opposed to the Park

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:27.520
Service's policy of "let it
burn."

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.283
So that the fundamental problem
here is that these resources are

00:03:32.283 --> 00:03:36.065
spanning the jurisdictional
boundaries and there is

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:40.375
inconsistency in the mission and
intent of these different

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:41.508
agencies.
 

00:03:41.508 --> 00:03:45.538
I want you also to think just a
moment about the grizzly bears.

00:03:45.538 --> 00:03:47.628
Grizzly bears are found in
Yellowstone.

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:51.460
They're found in Canada and
Alaska as well.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.161
But consider that this bear was
really a common property

00:03:58.161 --> 00:04:01.330
resource in legal terms.
 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.908
It basically would cross from
one area to another.

00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:08.973
This bear would be protected if
it happened to be wandering

00:04:08.973 --> 00:04:10.560
through National Park lands.
 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.769
But if it had wandered on
National Park lands say,

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.711
up in Alaska that were also
Native American lands that had

00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:26.307
been dedicated by the Native
Claim Settlement Act that

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:31.538
applies to Alaskan lands,
then this bear would be

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.139
appropriable.
 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.942
In other words,
Native Americans that lived in

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:39.120
that area would have the right
to hunt this bear.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.504
So I mean, think also about the
idea of fish,

00:04:42.504 --> 00:04:45.430
in addition to mammals such as
this.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.120
They are public resources until
they're killed.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.449
So if you get the right to go
hunting,

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.197
once you kill the animal,
then it becomes your private

00:04:54.197 --> 00:04:57.146
property,
unless of course it's a rare,

00:04:57.146 --> 00:04:59.319
threatened,
or endangered species.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:04.444
But even they may be
appropriable or shot or caught

00:05:04.444 --> 00:05:09.980
under some provisions of Native
populations' rights.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.430
So also think about the way
that we allocate fishing rights.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.223
In class, I was asked in
section about the boundary that

00:05:19.223 --> 00:05:23.930
surrounds nations and where the
rights are to fish,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.603
and can a different country
come into the waters of the

00:05:27.603 --> 00:05:29.886
United States,
the jurisdictional boundary of

00:05:29.886 --> 00:05:30.600
the United States.
 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:38.197
And we have a 200-mile limit as
do other nations within which we

00:05:38.197 --> 00:05:45.312
have the right to exclude other
parties or other groups from

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:50.980
coming in and fishing for
valuable species.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.029
I also want you to think about
the Maine coast for a moment.

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:57.139
This is an island.
 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.824
I had an opportunity to become
a steward or a manager of a

00:06:01.824 --> 00:06:05.769
Nature Conservancy preserve when
I was a Ph.D.

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:06.649
student here.
 

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:10.454
And I actually had writing
block, I was having a hard time

00:06:10.454 --> 00:06:12.790
writing my doctoral
dissertation.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.961
And I called a friend who I
knew was managing some lands for

00:06:15.961 --> 00:06:18.721
the Nature Conservancy,
and asked if they had a reserve

00:06:18.721 --> 00:06:21.399
that they needed help with for a
period of about six months.

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:23.250
And I'll never forget her.
 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.610
She was delighted to offer me a
chance to sit on this island,

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.680
which is about 250 acres,
it has a population of zero.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.110
So I would be the only person
there.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.160
And that was my house for six
months.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.129
I had a picnic table that
looked out over these waters.

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.266
This little shed was right
about there, the picnic table

00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:44.620
sat right there.
 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.709
And so I cranked-- no
electricity, no running water,

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:52.637
just a little outhouse,
and the only person on the

00:06:52.637 --> 00:06:53.519
island.
 

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:57.139
And I had a little Smith Corona
non-electric typewriter.

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.079
So I cranked out 350 pages of
my Ph.D.

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:01.649
sitting there looking out to
sea.

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:02.980
It was really quite an
experience.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.324
But I also learned a lot about
property rights and how rights

00:07:06.324 --> 00:07:09.000
are allocated to fishermen on
the Maine Coast.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.338
And, you know,
lobster is a valuable resource.

00:07:11.338 --> 00:07:14.629
So how are fishermen allowed to
set traps?

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:18.079
How is this regulated?
 

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:21.149
It turns out that it's
regulated differently by

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:25.088
different local governments,
and it's regulated in a variety

00:07:25.088 --> 00:07:25.889
of ways.
 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:30.358
Each of these different buoys
represented by the different

00:07:30.358 --> 00:07:35.139
colors you see here basically
are allocated to individuals.

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:37.839
So a color is assigned to a
single individual.

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:41.992
They have a legal right to fish
via a license that is provided

00:07:41.992 --> 00:07:43.560
by a local community.
 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.389
And it's a license that is not
gained easily.

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:50.261
In most of these communities,
you are not allowed to get a

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:53.081
license unless you've lived
there for a good part of your

00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:56.204
life or unless your parents or
grandparents have also fished in

00:07:56.204 --> 00:07:56.959
the area.
 

00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:01.178
And they also regulate the
number of traps that are allowed

00:08:01.178 --> 00:08:02.778
to be put on a line.
 

00:08:02.778 --> 00:08:05.459
So the deal is that you have a
buoy here,

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:07.970
it's tied by a rope to one of
these traps,

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.970
and that is linked by rope to
another trap,

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.649
and maybe nine, ten traps.
 

00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:17.110
In times of lobster scarcity or
during certain seasons of the

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.528
year, they may restrict the
number of traps.

00:08:20.528 --> 00:08:24.892
So you stuff the bait inside
the trap and then you throw it

00:08:24.892 --> 00:08:28.430
overboard, and you have a buoy
on either end.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:34.639
Well some lobstermen are
fishing without licenses.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:37.554
And it's kind of curious that
the culture in Maine is

00:08:37.554 --> 00:08:39.908
extremely protective of property
rights.

00:08:39.908 --> 00:08:42.486
If you look out across the
water in the Maine area,

00:08:42.486 --> 00:08:45.889
you see the coastline literally
dotted by these different buoys.

00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:49.991
And it's very common for one
boat to run over another boat's

00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:53.330
line and basically cut the trap
from the buoy.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.066
That's why they have two buoys
to protect against the loss,

00:08:57.066 --> 00:08:59.450
basically reduces the risk in
half.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.486
But what happened in the
instance that I'm going to tell

00:09:03.486 --> 00:09:07.451
you about when I was on the
island was that there was a

00:09:07.451 --> 00:09:09.533
newcomer,
a young guy about eighteen

00:09:09.533 --> 00:09:11.624
years old,
who wanted to set traps in this

00:09:11.624 --> 00:09:14.573
area that had been formerly
allocated to different members

00:09:14.573 --> 00:09:15.610
of the community.
 

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.320
He wasn't from that town.
 

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.440
He was thought of as an
outsider.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.846
They saw the new colored buoys
and they decided that they would

00:09:21.846 --> 00:09:23.000
teach him a lesson.
 

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.164
So that first thing that they
did was they cut the line to one

00:09:27.164 --> 00:09:28.190
of the buoys.
 

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.471
And they cut it cleanly so he
would recognize that this was an

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:32.440
intentional cut.
 

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.445
If a propeller runs over one of
these lines, it basically frays

00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:42.289
the end of it and it looks like
it's not been cleanly cut.

00:09:42.289 --> 00:09:44.429
So he didn't go away.
 

00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:47.019
He came back, reset his traps.
 

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:54.859
And so they cut the second buoy
off in addition to the first

00:09:54.859 --> 00:09:55.789
buoy.
 

00:09:55.789 --> 00:09:57.350
So he lost all of his traps.
 

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.288
Each one of these traps costs
about $200.

00:09:59.288 --> 00:10:01.904
So if you have five or six of
them, which he had,

00:10:01.904 --> 00:10:03.539
it's not a minor investment.
 

00:10:03.539 --> 00:10:05.700
So he came back.
 

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.520
The same color buoys popped up
in the area, a little bit

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.980
further out to sea.
 

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.284
So they decided that they were
going to have to take further

00:10:14.284 --> 00:10:14.788
action.
 

00:10:14.788 --> 00:10:18.379
One lobsterman pulled up and
pulled a gun out and shot over

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:22.216
his bow, a warning shot over the
bow, but literally a shot over

00:10:22.216 --> 00:10:22.960
the bow.
 

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.308
And that didn't seem to work
either.

00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:30.288
So one night they found where
he kept his boat in the evening,

00:10:30.288 --> 00:10:35.504
and they unscrewed one of his
sparkplugs from his engine and

00:10:35.504 --> 00:10:39.038
put the sparkplug inside his gas
tank.

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:42.677
So he showed up the next
morning and turned over his

00:10:42.677 --> 00:10:46.029
engine and the boat was blown to
smithereens.

00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:47.889
Luckily, he was not seriously
injured.

00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:52.750
So that basically taught him
the lesson that this was not his

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.908
territory and that he should
move on.

00:10:55.908 --> 00:11:00.360
But what's curious about this
is that they have this belief in

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.725
tradition,
this belief in custom,

00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:06.653
and belief that they had right
to fish in that area and no one

00:11:06.653 --> 00:11:08.778
else should come in this area.
 

00:11:08.778 --> 00:11:11.058
And the local government
doesn't have the capacity to

00:11:11.058 --> 00:11:13.586
monitor or police this,
nor does the state government

00:11:13.586 --> 00:11:15.976
or the Coast Guard or the
National Marine Fisheries

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:18.158
Service,
so they take the law into their

00:11:18.158 --> 00:11:18.730
own hands.
 

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.190
So now, if you ever are around
a coastal area,

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.822
including the Connecticut
coast, and you see these lobster

00:11:24.822 --> 00:11:27.254
buoys out there,
you'll know that they are

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:31.051
territorial boundaries that have
really important economic and

00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:32.418
legal significance.
 

00:11:32.418 --> 00:11:36.080
Think about the case of
national forests.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.578
Every time I fly to California
and I look down at the Rocky

00:11:38.578 --> 00:11:40.556
Mountains,
I shake my head thinking that

00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:43.048
most of the lands that I'm
looking at that look like

00:11:43.048 --> 00:11:45.149
they're denuded of forest are
national,

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:47.570
public domain.
 

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.895
And they've been basically
denuded, and the soils have

00:11:51.895 --> 00:11:56.466
washed off the steeper parts,
such as this example on the

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:59.570
Tongass National Forest in
Alaska.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:04.178
And they have no capacity to
regenerate.

00:12:04.178 --> 00:12:07.998
And this is because the Forest
Service gave out leases to

00:12:07.998 --> 00:12:12.226
timber companies to clear cut on
lands that really did not have

00:12:12.226 --> 00:12:16.250
the capacity to sustain that
form of timber harvesting.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:20.101
Clear cutting may be okay if
lands are flatter and you would

00:12:20.101 --> 00:12:24.215
not have this likelihood of loss
of soil and organic matter that

00:12:24.215 --> 00:12:28.460
literally prevents any form of
sustainable timber harvesting.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.278
So that hundreds of thousands
of acres in these steeper areas

00:12:32.278 --> 00:12:35.970
at higher elevations now are
incapable of supporting timber

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:39.789
because of the pressure that's
been put on the Forest Service

00:12:39.789 --> 00:12:43.100
to give out these property
rights in a sense,

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.000
these timber harvesting rights.
 

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.879
I'd like to switch gears for a
moment,

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:53.384
and I'm going to begin talking
about a number of cases that

00:12:53.384 --> 00:12:57.422
involve how we manage coastal
development and coastal

00:12:57.422 --> 00:12:58.509
resources.
 

00:12:58.509 --> 00:13:01.616
And I'd like you to think for a
moment about the California

00:13:01.616 --> 00:13:02.259
coastline.
 

00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:07.543
And this is being managed under
the California Coastal Act of

00:13:07.543 --> 00:13:12.298
1976 that created the California
Coastal Commission.

00:13:12.298 --> 00:13:18.070
And what's unusual about this,
and important,

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.131
is that they basically took the
idea that's invented in the

00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:22.594
Adirondack Park Agency Act,
the idea of zoning,

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:25.543
restricting density,
of trying to cluster

00:13:25.543 --> 00:13:28.879
development in areas that have
existing services.

00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:33.673
And then take areas that were
undeveloped and apply rules that

00:13:33.673 --> 00:13:38.073
demanded very large acreages
before new development could

00:13:38.073 --> 00:13:38.860
occur.
 

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:45.034
So this area lies within
roughly about a quarter- to a

00:13:45.034 --> 00:13:49.230
half-mile of the California
coast.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:52.548
And it demands that the state
get involved in permitting,

00:13:52.548 --> 00:13:54.758
just the way that the state
gets involved in permitting new

00:13:54.758 --> 00:13:56.129
development up in the
Adirondacks.

00:13:56.129 --> 00:14:01.621
So that California is unusual
in its history of public

00:14:01.621 --> 00:14:05.558
ownership of much of the
coastline,

00:14:05.558 --> 00:14:09.129
either as state parks or county
parks,

00:14:09.129 --> 00:14:11.638
or in some instances,
such as the Point Reyes

00:14:11.638 --> 00:14:14.888
National Seashore that was
carved out from lands that I'll

00:14:14.888 --> 00:14:16.769
speak about in just a moment.
 

00:14:16.769 --> 00:14:20.360
So think about the diverse set
of tools.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:26.028
What strategies could you use
to manage coastal development?

00:14:26.028 --> 00:14:29.700
Well, the government might just
go in and buy up the land,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.340
exercise their right of eminent
domain.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.192
Take it out of the private
sector, bring it into the public

00:14:36.192 --> 00:14:40.308
domain, which they did at the
Point Reyes National Seashore.

00:14:40.308 --> 00:14:43.729
They also did this at the Cape
Code National Seashore,

00:14:43.729 --> 00:14:47.601
Fire Island National Seashore,
Assateague Island in Maryland,

00:14:47.601 --> 00:14:49.860
and also Padre Island in Texas.
 

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.274
So this idea of going in and
buying up private land in the

00:14:54.274 --> 00:14:58.687
coastal zone should have strong
interest to us here in New

00:14:58.687 --> 00:15:01.133
Haven,
given our proximity to Long

00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:01.960
Island Sound.
 

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.249
But if you put this idea of
protecting resources in the

00:15:05.249 --> 00:15:08.903
coastal zone in the context of
what we now know about climate

00:15:08.903 --> 00:15:12.620
change and the probability of
sea level rise and the increased

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.274
frequency of storms that are
severe and increased severity of

00:15:16.274 --> 00:15:19.495
storms,
then you should begin to think

00:15:19.495 --> 00:15:23.916
about the degree of liability
that we face collectively as a

00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:25.811
nation,
about the intensity of

00:15:25.811 --> 00:15:28.440
development that we have allowed
in the coastal zone.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.139
So these coastal zone
management strategies bear a lot

00:15:33.139 --> 00:15:34.470
of attention.
 

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.980
They're worth thinking about.
 

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.649
What works in protecting
critical resources?

00:15:40.649 --> 00:15:42.379
What doesn't, and why?
 

00:15:42.379 --> 00:15:45.750
And how property rights might
be allocated in different ways.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.663
And remember the idea that
rights are not unitary,

00:15:50.663 --> 00:15:52.668
they are a bundle.
 

00:15:52.668 --> 00:15:55.070
They can be allocated a variety
of different ways.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.495
So that the Point Reyes
National Seashore that lies

00:15:58.495 --> 00:16:02.605
right next to the San Andreas
Fault is a wonderful area to go

00:16:02.605 --> 00:16:05.210
out and camp on,
hike on, bike on.

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.460
But it also is a really
interesting example of this idea

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.860
of buying up part of the bundle
of rights.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.719
So the Park Service went into
this area that was owned by

00:16:16.719 --> 00:16:19.750
farmers that had fairly large
tracts of land,

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.058
some hundreds or thousands of
acres in size.

00:16:23.058 --> 00:16:25.980
But because of its proximity to
San Francisco,

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.515
property values were increasing
quite rapidly during the 1960s

00:16:29.515 --> 00:16:31.899
and 1970s,
and there were a variety of

00:16:31.899 --> 00:16:35.038
different condominium
development plans that the Park

00:16:35.038 --> 00:16:36.970
Service began worrying about.
 

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.722
And this increase in
development pressure coincided

00:16:40.722 --> 00:16:45.001
with the Park Service's intent
to create more recreational

00:16:45.001 --> 00:16:47.629
opportunities in coastal areas.
 

00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:49.320
Why would they do that?
 

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.961
Well, in part because there
were not many National Parks in

00:16:52.961 --> 00:16:55.596
coastal areas,
but also in part because the

00:16:55.596 --> 00:16:56.100
U.S.
 

00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:00.249
population is concentrated more
heavily in coastal areas than it

00:17:00.249 --> 00:17:02.950
is in the interior part of the
country.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:08.299
And they could expand their
political and thereby economic

00:17:08.299 --> 00:17:13.181
base of support if they located
them in areas such as

00:17:13.181 --> 00:17:17.028
Massachusetts or Texas or
California.

00:17:17.028 --> 00:17:22.828
So they would enjoy a larger
budget, they would have a more

00:17:22.828 --> 00:17:26.828
diverse set of supporters in
Congress.

00:17:26.828 --> 00:17:29.339
So in this case,
they bought up the development

00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:30.650
rights to these farms.
 

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.558
Some twenty different farmers
agreed to sell the land.

00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:39.354
And when the Park Service does
this, they may come in and offer

00:17:39.354 --> 00:17:43.529
you X amount of dollars for your
development rights.

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:48.000
Or they may tell you that if
you don't agree to this deal,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.462
then we're going to exercise
eminent domain in full and we're

00:17:51.462 --> 00:17:53.308
going to take over your lands.
 

00:17:53.308 --> 00:17:55.317
So in this case,
all the farmers eventually

00:17:55.317 --> 00:17:57.230
agreed to sell the development
rights.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.169
In part, the idea was to
protect the open space

00:18:00.169 --> 00:18:03.747
agricultural character of the
area, which is really quite

00:18:03.747 --> 00:18:04.450
unique.
 

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:09.700
You see these rolling pastoral
landscapes,

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.900
and if it were in the form of a
traditional National Park,

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.410
where timber would not be
allowed to be harvested,

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.267
no timber leasing,
no mineral extraction in

00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:26.049
National Parks,
no leasing of grazing rights,

00:18:26.049 --> 00:18:28.328
and no farming.
 

00:18:28.328 --> 00:18:32.618
So that these restrictions
inside a National Park made this

00:18:32.618 --> 00:18:37.057
split of the bundle of rights
kind of an interesting strategy

00:18:37.057 --> 00:18:40.828
to maintain the pastoral
character of the area.

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:44.189
I'd also like you to think
about a different kind of

00:18:44.189 --> 00:18:47.220
problem that we face with
respect to mining.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.534
And the Mining Law of 1872 was
quite curious and important in

00:18:51.534 --> 00:18:53.259
environmental history.
 

00:18:53.259 --> 00:18:56.792
And it basically states that
all valuable minerals in and on

00:18:56.792 --> 00:18:58.529
lands belonging to the U.S.
 

00:18:58.529 --> 00:19:01.579
are free and open to
exploration and purchase by U.S.

00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:02.308
citizens.
 

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.873
So that you could go out and
try to stake a claim to mine on

00:19:05.873 --> 00:19:08.690
public lands,
provided that they were not

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.183
National Park lands or
designated Federal Wilderness

00:19:12.183 --> 00:19:15.368
lands,
and try to make your fortune.

00:19:15.368 --> 00:19:18.768
This was amended by the Mining
and Minerals Policy Act of 1970,

00:19:18.768 --> 00:19:21.288
and I'm not going to go through
all of this.

00:19:21.288 --> 00:19:24.577
But the intent and the purpose
was really to promote economic

00:19:24.577 --> 00:19:26.440
development on the public lands.
 

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.000
So if you think about the
public domain,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.967
many of you think of public
lands as being areas that the

00:19:33.967 --> 00:19:38.430
government is protecting and
managing for future generations.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:43.253
Well, most of the public lands
are thought of as economic

00:19:43.253 --> 00:19:48.250
development opportunities by
those that are responsible for

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.058
their management.
 

00:19:50.058 --> 00:19:53.244
Whether or not it's mining,
whether or not it's timber

00:19:53.244 --> 00:19:56.250
resources or grazing rights or
water resources,

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.298
the public lands have long been
thought of as playing a critical

00:20:00.298 --> 00:20:03.450
role in the economic development
of the nation.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:09.326
This explains in part why the
underlying mineral rights or the

00:20:09.326 --> 00:20:15.009
oil and gas rights are separable
from the surface rights.

00:20:15.009 --> 00:20:17.250
And many people do not
understand this.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.000
So here's an example of a
problem that we're facing in the

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.118
West right now.
 

00:20:22.118 --> 00:20:25.838
They're called coal bed methane
gas reserves.

00:20:25.838 --> 00:20:30.670
And from this hand-drawn map in
The High Country News,

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.048
you can see that they're
scattered from Arizona and New

00:20:34.048 --> 00:20:37.430
Mexico all the way up into
Montana and North Dakota.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.618
By the way, a plug for The
High Country News,

00:20:40.618 --> 00:20:45.880
one of Yale's graduates,
Florence Williams,

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.130
has been a reporter for The
High Country News,

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:53.220
a Yale graduate back in I think
the early 1990s.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.088
But I commend that journal to
you if you're interested in

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.779
western environmental politics.
 

00:20:57.779 --> 00:21:01.175
In this case,
what has happened is that those

00:21:01.175 --> 00:21:05.730
that own surface rights are
often not aware that the federal

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:09.976
government has often sold off
the underlying oil and gas

00:21:09.976 --> 00:21:10.980
rights.
 

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:17.453
So that farmers are waking up
in the morning to notices that

00:21:17.453 --> 00:21:23.269
their lands are going to be
invaded by bulldozers,

00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:26.292
and roads are going to be
constructed to get mining

00:21:26.292 --> 00:21:29.798
equipment in that look like this
kind of a drilling rig.

00:21:29.798 --> 00:21:33.960
The technology is quite simple
actually.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.170
There are a variety of
different approaches to this.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.863
But basically,
the predominant method now used

00:21:40.863 --> 00:21:45.377
is that-- forget about the
direction of these arrows for

00:21:45.377 --> 00:21:46.608
the moment.
 

00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:51.548
If you want to extract the
methane gas out of a coal bed,

00:21:51.548 --> 00:21:55.873
and that gas sits in the
fissures, it's often kept there

00:21:55.873 --> 00:22:00.196
by the water that's also in
those interstices within the

00:22:00.196 --> 00:22:01.220
coal bed.
 

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.988
So one way of getting and
releasing the methane gas is to

00:22:04.988 --> 00:22:07.210
pump the water out of the area.
 

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.807
And the analogy that's commonly
used is that it's like opening a

00:22:10.807 --> 00:22:12.750
soda can, and you hear that pop.
 

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:18.364
So you release the pressure and
the gas comes up and is pumped

00:22:18.364 --> 00:22:20.390
into a storage area.
 

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:24.037
Well, what happens when you
pump a whole lot of water out of

00:22:24.037 --> 00:22:25.460
an area such as this?
 

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:29.096
And to give you an example of
the scale of this extraction

00:22:29.096 --> 00:22:33.253
operation in the West right now,
as of about five years ago,

00:22:33.253 --> 00:22:37.460
there were nearly 10,000 of
these extraction wells that were

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.098
being actively used.
 

00:22:39.098 --> 00:22:42.833
In Wyoming alone,
in the Powder River Basin

00:22:42.833 --> 00:22:45.588
especially, up near Sheridan.
 

00:22:45.588 --> 00:22:47.788
And Ashley Roberts,
who graduated in the

00:22:47.788 --> 00:22:50.440
Environmental Studies major a
few years ago,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.558
wrote her senior essay on this
problem in Sheridan,

00:22:52.558 --> 00:22:56.747
Wyoming, and conducted her own
research that demonstrated that

00:22:56.747 --> 00:23:00.796
this groundwater extraction is
occurring at such an enormous

00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:05.051
rate that it's causing a change
in the chemical composition and

00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:08.210
the biological diversity of this
region.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:14.070
So there are trillions of cubic
feet of natural gas beneath the

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.490
surface here.
 

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.710
The scale of this operation is
really quite remarkable.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.728
And other firms,
looking at this diagram,

00:23:21.728 --> 00:23:25.953
now paying attention to the
arrows where the gas is being

00:23:25.953 --> 00:23:27.690
extracted this way.
 

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.865
The gas is being extracted in
this method by pumping

00:23:30.865 --> 00:23:34.038
CO_2 down into the
underlying coal bed.

00:23:34.038 --> 00:23:38.615
So this is thought of as a
win-win situation from a miner's

00:23:38.615 --> 00:23:42.637
perspective in that
CO_2 is being injected

00:23:42.637 --> 00:23:46.029
and sequestered under this
hypothesis,

00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:50.759
while the natural gas is being
extracted.

00:23:50.759 --> 00:23:57.141
Here's an example of one of the
unintended consequences from a

00:23:57.141 --> 00:24:02.788
rancher in southwestern Colorado
in La Plata County.

00:24:02.788 --> 00:24:05.115
"Well, in the late 1980s,
the kids started lighting the

00:24:05.115 --> 00:24:06.926
lemonade on fire,
so I knew something was going

00:24:06.926 --> 00:24:07.440
on."
 

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.660
Why would the lemonade catch
fire?

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.265
Well, it would catch fire
because the methane wasn't

00:24:14.265 --> 00:24:15.440
completely extracted.
 

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.430
It would seep into the
groundwater resources,

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:22.098
so that the lemonade had
methane that was flammable.

00:24:22.098 --> 00:24:26.986
Another example,
you may have read or seen the

00:24:26.986 --> 00:24:30.568
Horse Whisperer's film or book.
 

00:24:30.568 --> 00:24:34.760
So this is a story that has to
do with a Horse Whisperer's

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.318
complaint about coal bed methane
extraction on his property.

00:24:39.318 --> 00:24:42.115
The real Horse Whisperer,
the trainer,

00:24:42.115 --> 00:24:46.193
woke up one morning to
bulldozers carving a road across

00:24:46.193 --> 00:24:48.990
his property and he was
outraged.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.762
And he was one of the ranchers
that was not aware that the

00:24:52.762 --> 00:24:56.471
underlying mineral rights were
separable from the surface

00:24:56.471 --> 00:24:57.200
rights.
 

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.297
And he got his gun out and
thought that he could drive

00:25:02.297 --> 00:25:04.990
these people off the land.
 

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:09.126
And checking with authorities,
he found that they actually had

00:25:09.126 --> 00:25:13.128
purchased the lease to extract
the minerals from beneath the

00:25:13.128 --> 00:25:13.740
land.
 

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.077
So that he was basically left
with trying to figure out how he

00:25:18.077 --> 00:25:20.068
could minimize the damage.
 

00:25:20.068 --> 00:25:23.318
So that he did not have a right
to stop them.

00:25:23.318 --> 00:25:26.736
They built the roads,
they built the wells,

00:25:26.736 --> 00:25:28.769
they extracted the gas.
 

00:25:28.769 --> 00:25:34.532
The water that was pumped up
changed the chemical composition

00:25:34.532 --> 00:25:40.490
of water on his lands and in his
streams and drainage areas.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:45.232
And also the ditching and the
diking that was necessary to

00:25:45.232 --> 00:25:49.644
control the water made it
dangerous for him to run his

00:25:49.644 --> 00:25:50.558
cattle.
 

00:25:50.558 --> 00:25:54.750
So a lot of the farmers are
experiencing a more dangerous

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.970
situation to pursue their own
livelihood.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:02.063
So here's another example of
what it looks like from the air

00:26:02.063 --> 00:26:02.480
now.
 

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.273
These patches,
this patchwork quilt of

00:26:05.273 --> 00:26:06.710
extraction sites.
 

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.369
So now tens of thousands of
things have been constructed

00:26:10.369 --> 00:26:12.700
across the western United
States.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.071
So one way to think about this
is to think about the law of

00:26:16.071 --> 00:26:18.576
nuisance,
an act, an object or practice

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:22.188
that interferes with another's
rights or interests by being

00:26:22.188 --> 00:26:24.451
offensive,
annoying, dangerous,

00:26:24.451 --> 00:26:26.470
obstructive,
or unhealthful.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.275
There's a distinction between
what's thought of as a public

00:26:29.275 --> 00:26:30.920
nuisance and a private nuisance.
 

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.142
So a public nuisance interferes
with the collective interest and

00:26:35.142 --> 00:26:37.890
criminal prosecution may be the
remedy.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.057
But a private nuisance may be
thought of as a tort or a civil

00:26:41.057 --> 00:26:43.961
wrong at any activity that
interferes with the enjoyment

00:26:43.961 --> 00:26:47.227
and use of one's property,
i.e., the Horse Whisperer's

00:26:47.227 --> 00:26:47.828
property.
 

00:26:47.828 --> 00:26:50.838
And it may be the basis for
civil litigation.

00:26:50.838 --> 00:26:53.945
So the Horse Whisperer does
have, as would these other

00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:57.319
ranchers,
the opportunity to take the

00:26:57.319 --> 00:27:00.176
drilling company,
the gas company,

00:27:00.176 --> 00:27:01.950
the mining company to court.
 

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.842
But you know that form of
litigation often spans long

00:27:05.842 --> 00:27:07.190
periods of time.
 

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.851
So that to avoid litigation,
if you were the miner or the

00:27:10.851 --> 00:27:13.140
gas extractor,
what would you do?

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.073
You would try to enter into
some sort of a legal agreement

00:27:17.073 --> 00:27:21.144
with each of the farmers that
you would pay them X amount of

00:27:21.144 --> 00:27:24.318
money if they would agree not to
litigate.

00:27:24.318 --> 00:27:30.806
So there's a lot of legal
agreements that underlie these

00:27:30.806 --> 00:27:31.750
wells.
 

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:36.010
And another nuisance case from
the 1880s that has a bearing on

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:38.500
this,
if land use is considered to be

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.067
a nuisance,
it may be regulated without

00:27:41.067 --> 00:27:41.980
compensation.
 

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.727
Well, so that the damages in
this case might be regulated by

00:27:46.727 --> 00:27:48.980
a local government agency.
 

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.539
So local governments
traditionally have the role of

00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:54.714
adopting zoning and subdivision
regulations in a way that would

00:27:54.714 --> 00:27:56.608
control these kinds of
nuisances.

00:27:56.608 --> 00:28:01.400
So in one case,
this nuisance was defined by

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.960
Mugler v.
 

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.420
Kansas, a Supreme Court
decision back in 1887,

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.701
where the sale of alcoholic
beverages was believed to be a

00:28:09.701 --> 00:28:12.348
public nuisance and prevented by
regulation.

00:28:12.348 --> 00:28:15.970
And in this case,
compensation was not required.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:18.469
So not all rights to use the
land were removed,

00:28:18.469 --> 00:28:21.348
as the land could still be used
for other purposes.

00:28:21.348 --> 00:28:26.726
So the idea that government
could regulate land and not be

00:28:26.726 --> 00:28:30.500
required to compensate the
landowner,

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.057
in this case,
the owner of the store that

00:28:33.057 --> 00:28:38.259
sold alcoholic beverages,
that's an interesting idea.

00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:40.672
But the condition here is that
not all of the rights were

00:28:40.672 --> 00:28:43.214
removed and that he had other
opportunities to make economic

00:28:43.214 --> 00:28:44.118
use of that land.
 

00:28:44.118 --> 00:28:47.710
So keep that in mind as you
think about takings law.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:51.846
Another famous case in takings
law history is Euclid v.

00:28:51.846 --> 00:28:52.788
Ambler.
 

00:28:52.788 --> 00:28:58.336
The origin, this is a Supreme
Court decision from 1926 where a

00:28:58.336 --> 00:29:02.790
land use ordinance that
segregated residential and

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.519
commercial districts was
challenged,

00:29:06.519 --> 00:29:09.269
its constitutionality was
challenged.

00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:14.035
And it was believed by private
interests that the restrictions

00:29:14.035 --> 00:29:18.877
on new development in each zone
was a taking because it removed

00:29:18.877 --> 00:29:21.298
the value of that property.
 

00:29:21.298 --> 00:29:24.518
So if an individual was in a
residential zone and they wanted

00:29:24.518 --> 00:29:27.146
to build a store or a shopping
center or a casino,

00:29:27.146 --> 00:29:29.240
they would not be allowed to do
so.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:33.574
So that the authority of the
state or local governments

00:29:33.574 --> 00:29:37.346
acting on behalf of states to
restrict land use,

00:29:37.346 --> 00:29:41.038
to segregate land use,
to control density.

00:29:41.038 --> 00:29:45.700
This has been substantiated as
early as 1926.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.117
So the Supreme Court concluded
that state police power may be

00:29:49.117 --> 00:29:52.650
used to classify and regulate
land use to prevent nuisances.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:56.944
Another case that's
interesting, and one that I'm

00:29:56.944 --> 00:30:02.226
sure all of you have been to,
is the case of Penn Central

00:30:02.226 --> 00:30:04.462
Transportation Company v.
 

00:30:04.462 --> 00:30:08.670
The City of New York,
decided in 1978.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:12.068
So the question here surrounded
Grand Central Station.

00:30:12.068 --> 00:30:15.608
Now, Grand Central Station at
that time was managed by the

00:30:15.608 --> 00:30:17.970
Penn Central Transportation
Company.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.417
And the City of New York
decided that it wanted to

00:30:21.417 --> 00:30:25.500
designate Grand Central Station
as an historic landmark and

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.160
thereby prohibit development
above the terminal.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.252
Now, would this constitute a
taking of property without

00:30:33.252 --> 00:30:34.390
compensation?
 

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:36.058
So here's another kind of right.
 

00:30:36.058 --> 00:30:40.753
So the right to subsurface
resources, such as oil and gas

00:30:40.753 --> 00:30:42.848
needs to be considered.
 

00:30:42.848 --> 00:30:46.924
The right associated with
building on the surface needs to

00:30:46.924 --> 00:30:48.068
be considered.
 

00:30:48.068 --> 00:30:50.670
But this is an argument about
air rights.

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:53.779
So if you own the surface
rights, do you also own the air

00:30:53.779 --> 00:30:54.279
rights?
 

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:58.913
Or could the government come in
and restrict your ability to

00:30:58.913 --> 00:31:01.269
build to an infinite height?
 

00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:04.413
Well, zoning ordinances
commonly have building height

00:31:04.413 --> 00:31:05.318
restrictions.
 

00:31:05.318 --> 00:31:07.827
And in this case,
it was a bit unusual because

00:31:07.827 --> 00:31:10.336
the district that Grand Central
Station is in,

00:31:10.336 --> 00:31:13.180
I mean, you walk out and you
see the Yale Club.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.759
The Yale Club is just about as
high as Grand Central Station.

00:31:15.759 --> 00:31:18.848
But then look around you and
you see office buildings that

00:31:18.848 --> 00:31:21.232
are towering,
dozens and dozens of stories in

00:31:21.232 --> 00:31:21.828
height.
 

00:31:21.828 --> 00:31:25.388
And in this case,
the Supreme Court affirmed that

00:31:25.388 --> 00:31:29.467
the restrictions imposed by the
New York City's landmark

00:31:29.467 --> 00:31:33.545
preservation law on Penn
Central's right to construct an

00:31:33.545 --> 00:31:37.473
office building above the
terminal do not constitute a

00:31:37.473 --> 00:31:40.068
taking of private property.
 

00:31:40.068 --> 00:31:43.892
So that it upheld the
legitimacy of the designation of

00:31:43.892 --> 00:31:48.508
the site as an historic landmark
and the authority of New York to

00:31:48.508 --> 00:31:50.240
regulate air rights.
 

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:55.685
So one cannot presume that they
have a kind of infinite freedom

00:31:55.685 --> 00:31:58.410
to build to a greater height.
 

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:01.529
I want to bring another Supreme
Court case to your attention

00:32:01.529 --> 00:32:02.430
that's curious.
 

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.089
This is Hawaii Housing
Authority v.

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:07.318
Midkiff,
decided in 1984.

00:32:07.318 --> 00:32:11.838
Now, Hawaii is really an
unusual state.

00:32:11.838 --> 00:32:15.721
And prior to this time,
ninety-six percent of the state

00:32:15.721 --> 00:32:19.675
was owned by seventy-two land
owners or the state or the

00:32:19.675 --> 00:32:21.328
federal government.
 

00:32:21.328 --> 00:32:23.160
Just think about that for a
moment.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.877
So ninety-six percent of the
state was owned by just a

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:27.108
handful of landowners.
 

00:32:27.108 --> 00:32:30.597
So that in 1967,
the Hawaii legislature approved

00:32:30.597 --> 00:32:34.756
the use of eminent domain to
condemn residential lots and

00:32:34.756 --> 00:32:37.279
sell land to existing tenants.
 

00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:41.616
Now, if there are only
seventy-two landowners in

00:32:41.616 --> 00:32:43.586
Hawaii,
and I don't know what the

00:32:43.586 --> 00:32:45.259
population of Hawaii was at that
time,

00:32:45.259 --> 00:32:49.176
but let's just say for sake of
argument that it was a million

00:32:49.176 --> 00:32:52.630
people,
basically that meant that most

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:55.720
of those people,
the overwhelming majority of

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.593
them, would be forced into a
tenancy relationship with the

00:32:58.593 --> 00:33:01.314
landowner so that they would
have to enter into a lease

00:33:01.314 --> 00:33:02.068
agreement.
 

00:33:02.068 --> 00:33:06.251
But the legislature said,
"Well we basically want to

00:33:06.251 --> 00:33:10.509
break up this oligopoly,
even if the landowners object.

00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:12.368
And we should have the right to
do that."

00:33:12.368 --> 00:33:15.720
So they literally went in and
appropriated the land,

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.048
but they compensated the
landowners,

00:33:18.048 --> 00:33:21.627
so that these seventy-two
landowners did receive

00:33:21.627 --> 00:33:22.769
compensation.
 

00:33:22.769 --> 00:33:26.390
And then they sold the land
back to the existing tenants.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:29.480
So this is really a fairly
dramatic act on the part of any

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.509
state government.
 

00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:35.779
And it also raised questions
about the use of eminent domain.

00:33:35.779 --> 00:33:40.143
And the Supreme Court in this
case found that this was a

00:33:40.143 --> 00:33:44.109
legitimate use of the
constitutional right that the

00:33:44.109 --> 00:33:47.839
government has to exercise
eminent domain,

00:33:47.839 --> 00:33:49.410
and that it's not a taking.
 

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:52.752
That the single most important
criterion to justify the use of

00:33:52.752 --> 00:33:55.440
eminent domain is the nature of
the public use.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.496
And a public use is created
even when immediately turned

00:33:58.496 --> 00:33:59.828
over to private hands.
 

00:33:59.828 --> 00:34:02.057
And in this case,
the public use,

00:34:02.057 --> 00:34:05.958
or the key public interest,
was defined by the breakup of

00:34:05.958 --> 00:34:07.558
the land oligopoly.
 

00:34:07.558 --> 00:34:12.809
Another take on what public use
is was decided just several

00:34:12.809 --> 00:34:16.340
years ago right here in
Connecticut,

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.791
about forty miles away in New
London in a case known as

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:20.559
Kilo v.
 

00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:24.070
City of New London,
where the Supreme Court found

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:28.188
that the use of eminent domain
in that case by the City of New

00:34:28.188 --> 00:34:31.027
London,
because it wanted to encourage

00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:34.880
redevelopment of an area that
was in private ownership,

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.016
it decided that it would use
eminent domain and then it would

00:34:39.016 --> 00:34:42.050
sell the land back to a private
developer.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:48.117
So that as in the Hawaii case,
either the large landholding

00:34:48.117 --> 00:34:54.079
was broken up and then
redistributed to willing buyers.

00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:56.923
In this case,
the developer was already known

00:34:56.923 --> 00:35:00.418
to the City of New London,
so that the private rights were

00:35:00.418 --> 00:35:03.396
transferred first to the city
but then back to the private

00:35:03.396 --> 00:35:04.860
development organization.
 

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.998
And the court found that if an
economic project creates new

00:35:08.998 --> 00:35:11.242
jobs,
increases taxes or other city

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:14.130
revenues and revitalizes a
depressed urban area,

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:18.034
then that qualifies as a public
use and it's a legitimate

00:35:18.034 --> 00:35:22.429
exercise of eminent domain and
does not require compensation.

00:35:22.429 --> 00:35:28.099
Now this was decried by many
who argued that the Supreme

00:35:28.099 --> 00:35:31.809
Court really had lost its
bearing.

00:35:31.809 --> 00:35:35.280
And this cartoon gives you a
sense of that.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:40.052
And this cartoon is the Supreme
Court sitting on its front steps

00:35:40.052 --> 00:35:44.750
with a wrecking ball sitting in
front of it with a caption,

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.768
"Thanks to your ruling on
eminent domain,

00:35:46.768 --> 00:35:48.603
we can finally level this
building to make way for a

00:35:48.603 --> 00:35:49.429
Chuck-E Cheese."
 

00:35:49.429 --> 00:35:55.480
So that the decision about when
a taking has occurred is often

00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:01.530
dependent upon when a regulatory
action renders property to be

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.920
valueless.
 

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.724
So I'll take you back to the
Adirondacks for a moment and

00:36:06.724 --> 00:36:10.527
have you think about the way
that the Adirondack Park was

00:36:10.527 --> 00:36:11.480
regulated.
 

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:17.530
So rewind back to 1972,
before the Park Agency existed.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:22.088
Just assume that you had a
hundred acres of land and you

00:36:22.088 --> 00:36:27.559
had intended that you were going
to sell off one acre per year,

00:36:27.559 --> 00:36:30.248
and that was really going to
also provide retirement for you

00:36:30.248 --> 00:36:31.070
and your family.
 

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.978
In 1973, the state legislature
passes a law,

00:36:33.978 --> 00:36:37.090
and lo and behold,
you're in the green area.

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.429
So that means that you require
forty-two point three acres for

00:36:40.429 --> 00:36:41.360
a new building.
 

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.969
Now, shouldn't that constitute
a taking?

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:48.500
So that your expectation that
you could sell off a hundred

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.969
lots under the old zoning
ordinance was being dashed,

00:36:51.969 --> 00:36:55.440
and now you could only sell off
two lots.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:00.347
Shouldn't the government have
the obligation to compensate you

00:37:00.347 --> 00:37:04.210
for that loss in right and that
loss in value?

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:08.967
Well, the Supreme Court has
argued across a wide diversity

00:37:08.967 --> 00:37:13.891
of cases that if you are left
with a property right that has

00:37:13.891 --> 00:37:18.389
some lingering remnant value,
then a taking has not occurred.

00:37:18.389 --> 00:37:21.998
This was established back in
1922 in a case that's quite

00:37:21.998 --> 00:37:24.820
interesting, Pennsylvania
Coal Company v.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:25.739
Mahon.
 

00:37:25.739 --> 00:37:29.110
A statute that prohibited the
mining of coal underground in a

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:32.536
manner that causes subsidence of
homes on the surface went too

00:37:32.536 --> 00:37:34.559
far and did constitute a taking.
 

00:37:34.559 --> 00:37:38.755
So imagine if a coal company
started digging under your

00:37:38.755 --> 00:37:43.338
family home and the extent of
the digging or the instability

00:37:43.338 --> 00:37:48.079
of the geology caused your land
surface to subside and cave in

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:52.989
and harm your property,
does the government have the

00:37:52.989 --> 00:37:57.226
right to prohibit a mining
company from digging

00:37:57.226 --> 00:37:58.610
underground?
 

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:05.164
Well, in this case,
the court had argued that the

00:38:05.164 --> 00:38:11.719
prohibition of mining did
constitute a taking.

00:38:11.719 --> 00:38:12.559
Why?
 

00:38:12.559 --> 00:38:15.710
Well, because the underlying
mineral rights became worthless.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:19.891
All the value was taken away
from the underlying mineral

00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:20.500
value.
 

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.518
Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote:
"While property may be

00:38:22.518 --> 00:38:25.277
regulated to a certain extent,
if regulation goes too far,

00:38:25.277 --> 00:38:27.630
it will be recognized as a
taking."

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.768
So the key question in most of
these regulatory cases is when

00:38:30.768 --> 00:38:31.920
has it gone too far?
 

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.806
I'll give you another example
from the Adirondacks from a

00:38:34.806 --> 00:38:35.940
personal experience.
 

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:40.409
There was a developer that
wanted to build on a river area

00:38:40.409 --> 00:38:44.643
that was designated under the
New York State Scenic and

00:38:44.643 --> 00:38:46.840
Recreational Rivers Act.
 

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.358
And this developer wanted to
build about a hundred new units

00:38:50.358 --> 00:38:51.789
right along the river.
 

00:38:51.789 --> 00:38:56.704
The Park Agency came along and
decided that it would damage the

00:38:56.704 --> 00:39:01.063
floodplain, it would cause
physical structures to sit in

00:39:01.063 --> 00:39:02.570
the floodplain.
 

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.847
The floodplain,
for those of you that don't

00:39:04.847 --> 00:39:08.413
know the term,
is an area that's designated by

00:39:08.413 --> 00:39:13.018
a boundary that sits at the
location and elevation of a

00:39:13.018 --> 00:39:18.398
probable one hundred year flood,
so that it's probable that that

00:39:18.398 --> 00:39:22.719
intensity of storm will not
occur except once every hundred

00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:23.389
years.
 

00:39:23.389 --> 00:39:27.021
By the way, New Haven and my
home experienced almost a

00:39:27.021 --> 00:39:29.489
hundred year storm just last
week.

00:39:29.489 --> 00:39:34.630
So all of the low-lying lands
were flooded in the area.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:38.443
Connecticut River is just
cresting now from a storm last

00:39:38.443 --> 00:39:38.929
week.
 

00:39:38.929 --> 00:39:41.654
So that many people aren't
aware of this hundred-year flood

00:39:41.654 --> 00:39:42.030
plain.
 

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:45.074
So in this case,
the decision was made not to

00:39:45.074 --> 00:39:48.951
allow the development in the
flood plain and basically to

00:39:48.951 --> 00:39:53.449
permit the land to be used for a
different kind of a purpose.

00:39:53.449 --> 00:39:56.954
In that particular instance,
it was a campground that was

00:39:56.954 --> 00:39:57.579
allowed.
 

00:39:57.579 --> 00:40:00.684
So that the property owner went
to court and claimed that his

00:40:00.684 --> 00:40:03.842
property rights and his value
had been taken by the government

00:40:03.842 --> 00:40:05.809
and that he demanded
compensation.

00:40:05.809 --> 00:40:10.719
And in New York State,
the Supreme Court found that

00:40:10.719 --> 00:40:12.980
no, it was not taken.
 

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:16.563
In fact, he was left with a
perfectly viable economic use,

00:40:16.563 --> 00:40:19.768
which would be the continuance
of his campground.

00:40:19.768 --> 00:40:24.148
I'll give you another example
here from a coastal area in

00:40:24.148 --> 00:40:25.945
California, Nolan v.
 

00:40:25.945 --> 00:40:28.840
The California Coastal
Commission.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.610
Nolan had leased property
in Ventura, California.

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:36.393
He leased it with the option to
buy, but it was conditioned on

00:40:36.393 --> 00:40:40.159
the replacement of a 500 square
foot bungalow.

00:40:40.159 --> 00:40:42.552
And it required a permit from
the agency I mentioned a few

00:40:42.552 --> 00:40:44.610
moments ago, the California
Coastal Commission.

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:47.731
The Coastal Commission found
that the new house would block

00:40:47.731 --> 00:40:50.840
the ocean view,
contributing to the development

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.501
of a wall of residential
structures that would prevent

00:40:54.501 --> 00:40:58.855
the public psychologically from
realizing a stretch of coastline

00:40:58.855 --> 00:41:03.000
that exists nearby that they
have every right to visit.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.688
So to give you some sense of
this case, here's an aerial shot

00:41:07.688 --> 00:41:10.969
looking down at the Nolan
bungalow here.

00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:15.804
And you can see that all these
structures are actually sitting

00:41:15.804 --> 00:41:19.449
at the base of a cliff north of
Los Angeles.

00:41:19.449 --> 00:41:23.994
And like many of the California
coast area that is privately

00:41:23.994 --> 00:41:28.539
owned, you find these houses
separated only by several feet,

00:41:28.539 --> 00:41:30.079
these bungalows.
 

00:41:30.079 --> 00:41:33.929
So what would be the effect of
Nolan building higher?

00:41:33.929 --> 00:41:37.041
Well, the California Coastal
Commission was concerned about

00:41:37.041 --> 00:41:39.510
the obstruction of the view from
the public.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.617
So in effect,
it was a question about

00:41:41.617 --> 00:41:43.550
psychological or visual access.
 

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:48.135
The court found that the new
house would increase private use

00:41:48.135 --> 00:41:52.644
of the shorefront and would
cumulatively burden the public's

00:41:52.644 --> 00:41:56.619
ability to traverse to and along
the shorefront.

00:41:56.619 --> 00:42:00.675
So the Coastal Commission
granted a permit requiring a

00:42:00.675 --> 00:42:02.590
public access easement.
 

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:04.750
So this is kind of interesting.
 

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:08.242
So that the problem that they
found was blocked visual access,

00:42:08.242 --> 00:42:11.449
but the remedy that they
required was physical access.

00:42:11.449 --> 00:42:14.568
Now, you may not understand
that in California,

00:42:14.568 --> 00:42:18.498
physical access to the coastal
area is thought of as a very

00:42:18.498 --> 00:42:20.329
important public right.
 

00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:25.300
So Nolan, the person who had
bought the option to buy,

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:29.518
looked at the access condition
as a taking.

00:42:29.518 --> 00:42:32.326
He didn't want to provide
access across his property for

00:42:32.326 --> 00:42:32.989
the public.
 

00:42:32.989 --> 00:42:37.275
He didn't want to worry about
the public traipsing over his

00:42:37.275 --> 00:42:39.789
land or concerns about security.
 

00:42:39.789 --> 00:42:42.367
And the Supreme Court listened
to the case and it said that

00:42:42.367 --> 00:42:44.677
California wants an easement
across Nolan's property,

00:42:44.677 --> 00:42:45.699
it must pay for it.
 

00:42:45.699 --> 00:42:49.510
This constituted a taking
without compensation.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:52.378
And this is the definition of
what's come to be known as the

00:42:52.378 --> 00:42:53.789
"nexus argument."
 

00:42:53.789 --> 00:42:58.518
So that the projected damage,
in this case,

00:42:58.518 --> 00:43:00.860
the lack of visual access from
a higher building,

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:05.085
was being remedied by an
easement demand on the part of

00:43:05.085 --> 00:43:07.980
the state to provide public
access.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.393
So the court looked at that and
said, you know,

00:43:10.393 --> 00:43:13.119
there's no real connection
between the remedy and the

00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:14.380
hypothetical damage.
 

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:19.715
So that in cases where there is
a damage that is being claimed

00:43:19.715 --> 00:43:24.778
by a private landowner,
this would demand that any

00:43:24.778 --> 00:43:30.679
successful attempt to seek
compensation look to this,

00:43:30.679 --> 00:43:33.960
the quality and the strength of
the nexus argument.

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.269
I'm going to leave you with one
final case here.

00:43:36.269 --> 00:43:37.768
And this is the case of Florida.
 

00:43:37.768 --> 00:43:41.190
And given my earlier comments
about climate change and the

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:43.650
vulnerability of coastal
environments,

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:48.311
I can think of almost no other
state in the Union that has more

00:43:48.311 --> 00:43:52.070
property value that is
susceptible to loss than the

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:53.650
state of Florida.
 

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:58.581
And the state of Florida has a
very active beach renourishment

00:43:58.581 --> 00:43:59.389
program.
 

00:43:59.389 --> 00:44:03.184
So in the face of storms and
hurricane damage,

00:44:03.184 --> 00:44:08.329
one of the responses is to--
I'm going to scoot ahead here.

00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:12.239
One of the responses is to park
barges offshore and pump sand

00:44:12.239 --> 00:44:14.650
from offshore areas onto the
beach.

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:17.188
For those of you that are
interested in geology,

00:44:17.188 --> 00:44:20.052
there's kind of a very
interesting science about grain

00:44:20.052 --> 00:44:20.539
size.
 

00:44:20.539 --> 00:44:24.077
And they test very carefully
the grain size of the sands

00:44:24.077 --> 00:44:26.793
offshore,
and they know that some of the

00:44:26.793 --> 00:44:30.420
larger grains are more stable
than the smaller grains,

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.820
so that they would be less
prone to erosion.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:36.340
So just think about what you're
looking at here.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.789
This is sitting on a barrier
island.

00:44:38.789 --> 00:44:42.172
It's a strip of land that
literally is no more than a

00:44:42.172 --> 00:44:45.750
quarter of a mile in width,
and behind it lies a bay.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.630
This is typical of barrier
islands in the United States.

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:51.813
And in this case,
you probably have hundreds of

00:44:51.813 --> 00:44:55.550
millions of dollars of real
estate value that is highly

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:56.590
vulnerable.
 

00:44:56.590 --> 00:45:00.474
So that in the face of sea
level rise, we're going to be

00:45:00.474 --> 00:45:03.936
basically looking at coastal
areas as those in the

00:45:03.936 --> 00:45:05.420
Netherlands have.
 

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.706
In other words,
thinking about how to keep the

00:45:08.706 --> 00:45:11.335
coast safe,
how to push back the water,

00:45:11.335 --> 00:45:15.139
how to reflect the wave energy
by building dikes or sea walls,

00:45:15.139 --> 00:45:17.190
or in this case,
beach nourishment.

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:21.061
There's another example of
buildings almost sitting in the

00:45:21.061 --> 00:45:25.070
water and the erosion that is
occurring following storms.

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:29.768
So and here's another example
of what the state of Florida is

00:45:29.768 --> 00:45:32.590
doing to build up that
beachfront.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:36.619
So just a quick version here.
 

00:45:36.619 --> 00:45:40.400
In Walton County,
Florida wanted to renourish the

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:45.048
shorefront with sand under the
provisions of Florida's Beach

00:45:45.048 --> 00:45:49.539
and Shore Preservation Act that
was recently adopted.

00:45:49.539 --> 00:45:52.530
It fixed a boundary between the
publically owned land and

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:53.760
privately owned land.
 

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.380
So that imagine that this is
your house,

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:00.358
and imagine that you have a
thin strip of sand between your

00:46:00.358 --> 00:46:03.349
house and the ocean,
which is this open area in

00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:05.090
front of the stage here.
 

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:08.489
And then imagine that the state
wants--

00:46:08.489 --> 00:46:12.619
and you think of yourself as
being a shorefront owner and

00:46:12.619 --> 00:46:17.190
that the public has no right of
access across your area because

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:21.909
the mean high watermark sits
down a ways from where you are.

00:46:21.909 --> 00:46:24.893
Now, supposing that the state
comes through and decides they

00:46:24.893 --> 00:46:26.309
want to nourish the beach.
 

00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:27.909
They're going to build up that
area.

00:46:27.909 --> 00:46:31.112
So that the state literally set
a boundary between the private

00:46:31.112 --> 00:46:32.530
land and the public land.
 

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:36.119
And the property owners,
the private property owners,

00:46:36.119 --> 00:46:38.329
argued that that was a taking.
 

00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:41.943
That was a taking of their
property right to own

00:46:41.943 --> 00:46:44.894
shorefront,
because now there was private

00:46:44.894 --> 00:46:47.159
land up to the edge of the
stage,

00:46:47.159 --> 00:46:50.324
and then beyond that,
where the sand had been

00:46:50.324 --> 00:46:53.192
deposited,
that was a strip of public land

00:46:53.192 --> 00:46:55.250
that was open for public access.
 

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:59.490
So that these landowners wanted
exclusive right to control that

00:46:59.490 --> 00:46:59.969
area.
 

00:46:59.969 --> 00:47:03.320
Well, they alleged that the
Florida Supreme Court violated

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.259
the due process and takings
clauses by suddenly and

00:47:06.259 --> 00:47:09.610
unpredictably changing state
substantive law that deprived

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:13.489
these owners of their private
property without compensation.

00:47:13.489 --> 00:47:16.382
And the Florida Supreme Court
ruled that beachfront property

00:47:16.382 --> 00:47:19.128
owners had no right to their
property to continue contact

00:47:19.128 --> 00:47:21.865
with the water,
nor any vested right of future

00:47:21.865 --> 00:47:22.920
breach accretion.
 

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:27.994
So the court argued that
basically they didn't know what

00:47:27.994 --> 00:47:33.440
was going to happen in that area
that is now open water,

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.905
that the private landowner
doesn't have any right of

00:47:36.905 --> 00:47:40.914
expectation that their land
would just simply extend all the

00:47:40.914 --> 00:47:44.449
way down to the mean high
watermark if the state kept

00:47:44.449 --> 00:47:46.760
dumping sand in front of it.
 

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:51.422
So that this has become a very
popular case that's pending

00:47:51.422 --> 00:47:53.960
before the Supreme Court now.
 

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.079
And it may be decided in the
next week or so.

00:47:56.079 --> 00:48:00.159
So it's stop the beach
nourishment versus the county,

00:48:00.159 --> 00:48:04.664
and a coalition of twenty-six
states have supported amici

00:48:04.664 --> 00:48:07.000
briefs,
including the Obama

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.289
Administration.
 

00:48:08.289 --> 00:48:11.909
So that during the argument in
front of the Supreme Court,

00:48:11.909 --> 00:48:14.568
it was interesting,
because the Solicitor General

00:48:14.568 --> 00:48:17.780
that represents the United
States government in the Supreme

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:21.103
Court made a case in favor of
the state's rights to renourish

00:48:21.103 --> 00:48:21.989
the lands.
 

00:48:21.989 --> 00:48:26.050
Every state in the country that
has coastal property has an

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:30.389
interest in this because they do
not want to have to compensate

00:48:30.389 --> 00:48:34.309
private landowners for any
activity that they take to try

00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:37.389
to prevent additional property
damage.

00:48:37.389 --> 00:48:40.844
I'm going to zoom ahead here
and then we'll conclude in just

00:48:40.844 --> 00:48:41.489
a minute.
 

00:48:41.489 --> 00:48:44.382
But remember also that
pesticide regulation raises the

00:48:44.382 --> 00:48:46.730
questions of property rights and
takings.

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:48.760
Because the government's
required--

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.327
in a case where the government
bans a chemical that is already

00:48:52.327 --> 00:48:54.476
licensed--
it's required to purchase

00:48:54.476 --> 00:48:56.909
existing stocks of newly-banned
products.

00:48:56.909 --> 00:48:59.824
So that even though they find
that a chemical is more

00:48:59.824 --> 00:49:03.579
dangerous than they thought and
they had previously licensed it,

00:49:03.579 --> 00:49:06.155
if they've gotten new evidence
of risk and they take away the

00:49:06.155 --> 00:49:09.447
right to market that product,
the chemical companies can

00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:13.655
successfully argue and have
argued that that constitutes a

00:49:13.655 --> 00:49:15.869
taking that is compensable.
 

00:49:15.869 --> 00:49:18.389
So there are 23,000 of these
registrations out there.

00:49:18.389 --> 00:49:24.010
I'm going to conclude with one
final thought,

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:30.753
and that is that among all
these strategies that might be

00:49:30.753 --> 00:49:37.259
applied to protect public
resources and also to protect

00:49:37.259 --> 00:49:42.920
against private damage to the
environment,

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:47.237
the use of regulation is an
extremely important opportunity

00:49:47.237 --> 00:49:49.768
for state and local governments.
 

00:49:49.768 --> 00:49:54.739
So that if you apply a strict
standard against takings,

00:49:54.739 --> 00:49:58.786
in other words,
if you demand that taking of

00:49:58.786 --> 00:50:03.585
all property value be required
prior to the grant of

00:50:03.585 --> 00:50:06.688
compensation,
that offers the greatest

00:50:06.688 --> 00:50:09.860
opportunity for governments to
be effective in pursuing

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.329
environmental agendas.
 

00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:14.510
So we'll come back and talk a
bit more at the end of the week

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:16.630
about several alternative
strategies,

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:20.739
particularly marketing of
ecosystem service payments.

00:50:20.739 --> 00:50:22.889
Thank you.
 

00:50:22.889 --> 00:50:29.000

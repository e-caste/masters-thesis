00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.985
Prof: Today we're going
to talk about Adaptive Genetic

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:06.640
Change.
 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.382
And in order to set the stage
for this, before I get into the

00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:15.255
slides, I would like you to
consider the following

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:16.520
proposition.
 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.890
Every evolutionary change on
the planet,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.420
that has ever led to something
that you think is cool and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.690
interesting and is well
designed,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.326
whether it is the brain of a
bat, or the vertebrate immune

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:33.539
system,
or the beautiful structure of

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.653
the ribosome,
or the precision of meiosis,

00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:40.600
has occurred through a process
of adaptive genetic change.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.435
A mutation has occurred that
had an effect on a process or a

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:46.633
structure and,
if it increased the

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:49.740
reproductive success of the
organism that it was in,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.802
it was retained by evolution;
and if it did not,

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:54.960
it disappeared.
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.745
So what we're talking about
today is a look into a very

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:04.530
basic mechanism that is
operating in all of life and is

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.430
causing the accumulation of
information.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.030
Now, these are the keys to the
lecture.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.739
In the middle of the lecture
you're going to get a couple of

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:19.450
slides that have tables and
equations on them and stuff like

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.186
that,
and I'll lead you through one

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:24.072
of those tables,
and I'll ask you to go through

00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:24.980
another one.
 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.260
But they're not the point.
 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.230
The point is this.
 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.766
There are four major genetic
systems, and there are some

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.890
interesting exceptions to them.
 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.056
But you can capture a big chunk
of the variation in the genetics

00:01:40.056 --> 00:01:43.760
of the organisms on the planet
with just four systems.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.920
Okay?
 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.593
They are sexual versus asexual
and haploid versus diploid,

00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:52.075
and those differences make a
big difference to how fast

00:01:52.075 --> 00:01:53.430
evolution occurs.
 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.071
You guys are sexual diploids
and you evolve slowly,

00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:03.920
and your pathogens are asexual
haploids and they evolve fast.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.242
That's important,
the kind of thing you ought to

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:06.590
know.
 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.141
Now when we get into the
equations of population

00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:16.407
genetics--
they're just algebra--the point

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:21.551
is that you can always go find
them in a book and you can

00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:26.566
program them pretty easily,
even in simple spreadsheet

00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:30.185
programs like Excel,
and you can understand their

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:33.120
basic properties by playing
around with them.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.735
If you go on the web and go to
Google and type Hardy-Weinberg

00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:38.913
equations,
you're going to get 20 websites

00:02:38.913 --> 00:02:41.660
around the country where some
professor of population genetics

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.223
has put up some package for
students to play with and it's

00:02:44.223 --> 00:02:46.835
going to generate all kinds of
beautiful pictures and stuff

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:47.598
like that.
 

00:02:47.598 --> 00:02:50.960
It's real easy for you to lay
your hands on these tools now.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.599
What's important for you to
know is (a) that they are there

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.860
and represent something
important;

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.550
(b) what their major
consequences are;

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.938
and (c) how to get a hold of
them when you need them.

00:03:01.938 --> 00:03:05.437
I am not going to ask you to
repeat the derivation of the

00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:08.000
Hardy-Weinberg equations on a
mid-term.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.530
Okay?
 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.933
But I do expect you to know why
they're important and what

00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:13.889
they're about.
 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.139
The third thing that I want you
to take home from this lecture

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.038
is that when adaptive genetic
change starts to occur,

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:27.270
it is virtually always slow at
the beginning,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.860
fast in the middle and slow at
the end.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.310
So that if you are looking at a
graph of gene frequencies over

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.580
time, it looks like an S;
and that's the third thing.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.430
That's it, there's the lecture,
ta-da.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.110
Now background to this decision.
 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.757
When, in 1993,
Rolf Hoekstra and I began to

00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:48.720
put together the first edition
of this book,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.449
I asked Rolf to be my co-author
because he is a population

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:53.300
geneticist.
 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.050
He has a marvelously clear mind.
 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.212
He likes those kinds of
equations and he's really good

00:03:59.212 --> 00:03:59.810
at them.
 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.354
And we, Rolf and I,
went around and we asked about

00:04:02.354 --> 00:04:05.054
fifteen of the leading
evolutionary biologists in the

00:04:05.054 --> 00:04:06.818
world, "What's important?
 

00:04:06.818 --> 00:04:09.110
What should every biologist
know about evolution?

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.250
This is for everybody.
 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.633
This is for doctors and
molecular biologists and

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:14.560
developmental biologists,
everybody.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.628
What should they know?"
 

00:04:15.628 --> 00:04:18.211
And I said, "Rolf,
your job is to figure out the

00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:20.100
part from population
genetics."

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.547
And he came back,
after about two weeks,

00:04:21.547 --> 00:04:22.771
and he said,
"You know Steve,

00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:24.329
I don't think there is
anything."

00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:26.149
I was shocked.
 

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:27.949
I said, "Rolf,
you're a population geneticist.

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.350
This stuff is important,
right?"

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.629
And then he said,
"You know,

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.490
the way we normally teach
population genetics,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.692
which is as a big bunch of
equations that are about drift

00:04:37.692 --> 00:04:41.670
and frequency change under
selection and so forth,

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.579
most people end up not really
needing that.

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:47.906
What they need to know is that
there are four main genetic

00:04:47.906 --> 00:04:50.533
systems and that genetic change
is slow, fast,

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:51.410
slow."
 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.050
So that's where this lecture
came from.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.797
It came from somebody thinking
deeply about that,

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:58.399
and asking lots of people.
 

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.995
Now if you like this,
there's a whole field there,

00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:04.120
there's a whole bunch of
wonderful stuff that you can do.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.060
But these are the things that
everybody I think should know.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.319
So here's the outline.
 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.771
I'm going to give you the
context, the historical context

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:17.225
that led to the concentration on
genetics in evolutionary

00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:18.180
biology.
 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.209
I'll talk a little about the
main genetic systems.

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:25.125
Then I'll run through changes
in gene frequencies under

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:27.226
selection and,
if I have time,

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:30.778
I'll get to selection on
quantitative traits.

00:05:30.778 --> 00:05:33.639
If I don't get to selection on
quantitative traits,

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.269
it will be because I have
engaged in a dialog with you

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:41.043
about some interesting puzzles,
and that dialog is more

00:05:41.043 --> 00:05:44.500
important to me than getting to
quantitative genetics.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.649
Okay?
 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:50.452
So here's how genetics became a
key element in evolutionary

00:05:50.452 --> 00:05:51.279
thought.
 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:55.971
Darwin did not have a plausible
genetic mechanism and he failed

00:05:55.971 --> 00:05:59.235
to read Mendel's paper,
which came out six years after

00:05:59.235 --> 00:06:02.358
he wrote The Origin,
but before he constructed some

00:06:02.358 --> 00:06:04.600
of the later editions of his
book,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.238
and so he reacted by
incorporating elements of

00:06:10.238 --> 00:06:14.500
Lamarck into his later editions.
 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.850
If you read the Sixth Edition
of The Origin of Species,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.028
it's got some really Lamarckian
statements in it,

00:06:19.028 --> 00:06:20.980
inheritance of acquired
characteristics.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.141
Anybody here know what the
problem was with Darwin's

00:06:25.141 --> 00:06:26.528
original model?
 

00:06:26.528 --> 00:06:30.740
Anybody know how Darwin thought
genetics worked in 1859?

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:38.670
He had a model of blending
inheritance.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:44.000
That meant that he thought that
when the gametes were formed,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.374
gemmules from all over the
body, that had been out there

00:06:47.374 --> 00:06:50.319
soaking up information about the
environment,

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:53.730
swam down into the gametes,
into the gonads,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.310
carrying with them information
about the environment into the

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.463
gametes,
and that then when the zygote

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:05.884
was formed,
that the information from the

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:10.088
mother and the information from
the father blended together like

00:07:10.088 --> 00:07:11.088
two liquids.
 

00:07:11.088 --> 00:07:14.338
In other words,
he didn't think of genes as

00:07:14.338 --> 00:07:16.660
distinct material particles.
 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.889
He thought of them as fluids.
 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:26.134
Now if I give you a glass of
red wine and a glass of white

00:07:26.134 --> 00:07:32.490
wine, and I pour them together,
I get pink wine.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.952
And if I take that glass of
pink wine and I pour it together

00:07:36.952 --> 00:07:41.490
with another glass of white
wine, I get even lighter pink.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.317
And you can see that if I
continue this,

00:07:44.317 --> 00:07:47.220
pretty soon red disappears
completely.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.615
The problem with blending
inheritance is that the parental

00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:55.471
condition gets blended out and
there isn't really a

00:07:55.471 --> 00:07:57.940
preservation of information.
 

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.019
That's why Darwin came under
attack.

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:04.290
And Mendel wasn't known,
and he resorted to

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.750
Lamarckianism,
and he was wrong.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.889
So genetics became an issue.
 

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:15.014
In the year 1900 there was a
simultaneous rediscovery of

00:08:15.014 --> 00:08:18.298
Mendel's Laws,
and at that point people went

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:20.410
back and they read Mendel's
paper,

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.610
and they realized that they had
missed this 35 years earlier.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.769
Then the so-called 'fly group'
of Thomas Hunt Morgan and

00:08:29.769 --> 00:08:34.160
Sturtevant and Bridges,
who were working at Cal-Tech,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.658
demonstrated that genes are
carried on chromosomes.

00:08:37.658 --> 00:08:41.720
And enough then was known about
cytology,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.831
so that we knew that
chromosomes had an elaborate

00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:48.211
kind of behavior,
at mitosis and meiosis,

00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:52.246
and people then,
about 1915, showed that in fact

00:08:52.246 --> 00:08:57.139
the behavior of chromosomes was
consistent with Mendel's Laws.

00:08:57.139 --> 00:08:59.706
They didn't know at that point
what chromosomes were made out

00:08:59.706 --> 00:08:59.918
of.
 

00:08:59.918 --> 00:09:01.832
They had no notion of the
genetic code,

00:09:01.832 --> 00:09:04.552
but they could establish
experimentally that genes were

00:09:04.552 --> 00:09:08.730
on chromosomes;
and that was done by 1915.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.240
However, there were still
issues about whether all of this

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.879
would actually work at the
population level.

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:21.191
It was not immediately clear
that you could take Mendelian

00:09:21.191 --> 00:09:25.200
genetics and then construct
populations out of it,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.697
that obeyed Mendel's Laws,
and have natural selection

00:09:28.697 --> 00:09:29.168
work.
 

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:33.149
To do that actually required a
fair amount of math,

00:09:33.149 --> 00:09:36.653
and the people who did it were
Ronald Fisher,

00:09:36.653 --> 00:09:41.110
J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall
Wright, and they did it between

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.340
about 1918 and 1932.
 

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.918
In so doing,
they also invented much of what

00:09:46.918 --> 00:09:50.080
is now regarded as basic
statistics.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.125
So Fisher had to invent
analysis of variance in order to

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:58.428
understand quantitative
genetics,

00:09:58.428 --> 00:10:01.956
and Wright had to invent path
coefficients in order to

00:10:01.956 --> 00:10:05.284
understand how pedigrees
translate into patterns of

00:10:05.284 --> 00:10:06.350
inheritance.
 

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.110
So these guys laid the
foundations.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.226
As a result of that,
genetics really became regarded

00:10:12.226 --> 00:10:15.464
as kind of the core of
evolutionary biology during the

00:10:15.464 --> 00:10:18.499
twentieth century,
and there's been a tremendous

00:10:18.499 --> 00:10:19.678
concentration on it.
 

00:10:19.678 --> 00:10:24.434
And it is still true that many
people will not accept a claim

00:10:24.434 --> 00:10:29.030
about any evolutionary process
unless it can be shown to be

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.330
consistent with genetics.
 

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.120
That's sort of a Gold Standard.
 

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.956
If you can't do it genetically,
if you can demonstrate it's

00:10:36.956 --> 00:10:39.158
genetically illogical,
then a claim just falls

00:10:39.158 --> 00:10:41.817
theoretically;
you don't even have to go out

00:10:41.817 --> 00:10:42.918
and get the data.
 

00:10:42.918 --> 00:10:46.706
Therefore, of course,
the Young Turks have great joy

00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:51.384
in discovering cases that don't
fit and come up with epigenetics

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:53.759
and lots of stuff like that.
 

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:55.659
At any rate,
that's ahead of you;

00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:56.908
that's not today.
 

00:10:56.908 --> 00:11:03.196
The genetic system of a species
is really the basic determinant

00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:05.629
of its rate of change.
 

00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:08.653
So we have sexual versus
asexual species--there are

00:11:08.653 --> 00:11:12.101
complications to this--and we
have haploid versus diploid,

00:11:12.101 --> 00:11:14.399
and there are other ploidy
levels.

00:11:17.928 --> 00:11:21.538
Can anybody name me asexual
vertebrates;

00:11:21.538 --> 00:11:24.350
not sexual vertebrates but
asexual vertebrates?

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.490
Anybody ever heard of an
asexual vertebrate?

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:33.981
Fish, amphibians,
reptiles, birds,

00:11:33.981 --> 00:11:35.950
mammals?
 

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.676
Student:  Wasn't there a
recent documentation of a shark?

00:11:39.676 --> 00:11:40.798
You mentioned it.
 

00:11:40.798 --> 00:11:43.863
Prof: I could imagine
that a shark might be capable of

00:11:43.863 --> 00:11:44.679
being asexual.
 

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:46.428
I haven't heard of that case.
 

00:11:46.428 --> 00:11:47.874
Student:  I think it was
kind of a

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:48.850
&gt;
 

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:49.659
Prof: Yes,
there are some.

00:11:49.659 --> 00:11:51.009
There are some asexual lizards.
 

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:56.980
There are some interestingly
asexual fish.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.370
There are some frogs that
manage to be kind of

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:07.129
quasi-asexual by using male
sperm but then not incorporating

00:12:07.129 --> 00:12:12.226
it into gametes--
excuse me, in the developing

00:12:12.226 --> 00:12:12.879
baby.
 

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:15.860
So they use it just to
stimulate development.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.028
There's one case in captivity
of an asexual turkey.

00:12:19.028 --> 00:12:23.000
But asexual types are not
frequent among vertebrates.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.820
They are common in plants.
 

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.745
Of course, most bacterial sex
is asexual, although bacteria do

00:12:29.745 --> 00:12:31.360
have a bit of sex.
 

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.870
You're diploid;
your adult large form is

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.970
diploid.
 

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.126
Anybody know what group of
plants is haploid in the state

00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:47.134
in which you normally see them
in nature, where the big

00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:49.659
recognizable thing is haploid?
 

00:12:49.659 --> 00:12:51.700
I'll show you one in a minute.
 

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.429
I just wanted to check.
 

00:12:52.429 --> 00:12:55.269
Mosses;
mosses are haploid.

00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:59.519
Okay, so this is what's going
on with these four systems.

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:03.604
Basically the difference
between sexual haploids and

00:13:03.604 --> 00:13:08.249
sexual diploids is the point in
the lifecycle where meiosis

00:13:08.249 --> 00:13:09.129
occurs.
 

00:13:09.129 --> 00:13:14.707
If the adult is diploid and
meiosis occurs in gonads in the

00:13:14.707 --> 00:13:19.590
adults that produce gametes,
and then the zygote form

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:24.261
develops so that all of the
cells in the developing organism

00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:27.460
are diploid,
you get the diploid cycle.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.658
If you have the zygote having
meiosis immediately,

00:13:32.658 --> 00:13:36.615
or shortly after being formed,
so that the developing young

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:39.779
are haploid,
then you get a haploid adult.

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:42.399
So this is what moss do and
this is what we do.

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:45.553
Then we have asexual haploids
and asexual diploids,

00:13:45.553 --> 00:13:48.710
and at least in outline they
look pretty simple.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.798
Asexual diploid,
just makes a copy of itself;

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:55.009
just goes through mitosis,
makes babies.

00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:58.240
Asexual haploid,
same kind of thing.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.639
So those are the four major
genetic systems.

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:05.158
There are many,
many variations on them.

00:14:05.158 --> 00:14:09.091
So the asexual haploids are
things like the tuberculosis

00:14:09.091 --> 00:14:11.893
pathogen,
blue-green algae,

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:16.580
the bread mould,
the penicillin fungus,

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.692
cellular slime moulds,
and they constitute the bulk of

00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:23.019
the organisms on the planet.
 

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:28.769
Sexual haploids are things like
moss, and red algae;

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:32.158
most fungi are sexual haploids.
 

00:14:32.158 --> 00:14:36.375
In this case you can see that's
where the haploid adult is in

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:37.500
the lifecycle.
 

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.928
There are where the gametes are
formed.

00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:43.940
They are formed up on the head
of the adult.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.798
You can see the pink and the
blue are coding for the male and

00:14:47.798 --> 00:14:50.629
the female gametes,
on different parts of the

00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:51.658
gametophyte.
 

00:14:51.658 --> 00:14:58.940
Then the zygote forms where the
sperm gets into an ovule,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:05.570
on the tip of the plant,
and then the young actually

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.168
develop up here.
 

00:15:08.168 --> 00:15:12.611
So this is haploid up here and
then the spores go out--meiosis

00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:17.200
has occurred in here and the
spores go out as haploid spores.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.038
So that is a sexual haploid
lifecycle.

00:15:21.038 --> 00:15:27.298
The asexual diploids include
the dynoflagelates;

00:15:27.298 --> 00:15:29.639
there are about ten groups of
the protoctists--

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:31.918
that's the modern name for what
you think of as protozoa,

00:15:31.918 --> 00:15:35.086
but it also includes some
single-celled organisms that

00:15:35.086 --> 00:15:38.354
have chloroplasts in them--
the unicellular algae,

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:41.129
some protozoa,
some unicellular fungi.

00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:44.159
There are a lot of
multi-cellular animals that are

00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:46.325
asexual diploids,
and this one here,

00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:48.798
the bdelloid rotifer is one of
them.

00:15:48.798 --> 00:15:54.269
It is called a scandalous
ancient asexual.

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:58.249
Anybody know why the word
'scandalous' is used in this

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.000
context?
 

00:16:04.039 --> 00:16:07.210
Yes?
 

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.840
What?
 

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.970
Student:  No males.
 

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.886
Prof: There are no males;
bdelloid rotifers do not have

00:16:13.886 --> 00:16:16.159
any males, nobody's ever seen a
male bdelloid rotifer.

00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:20.551
But that's not the scandal;
I mean, if you're a male you

00:16:20.551 --> 00:16:22.009
might think it was scandalous.
 

00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:22.399
Right?
 

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:22.788
&gt;
 

00:16:22.788 --> 00:16:24.524
But for an evolutionary
biologist, no,

00:16:24.524 --> 00:16:25.649
that's not scandalous.
 

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.490
Well it actually has to do with
this part of it right here.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.110
Almost all asexual organisms on
the planet,

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.100
that are
multi-cellular--leaving out the

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.775
bacteria--
but all the multi-cellular ones

00:16:45.775 --> 00:16:48.440
are derived from sexual
ancestors and originated

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.663
relatively recently,
with a few exceptions,

00:16:50.663 --> 00:16:52.038
and this is one of the
exceptions.

00:16:52.038 --> 00:16:56.292
There is a whole huge body of
literature on the evolution of

00:16:56.292 --> 00:17:00.760
sex that says one of the things
that sex is good for is that it

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.778
allows long persistence.
 

00:17:02.778 --> 00:17:07.032
We see that sexual things have
been in a sexual state on the

00:17:07.032 --> 00:17:10.931
Tree of Life for a long time,
and the asexual things have

00:17:10.931 --> 00:17:13.795
branched off of it,
and we don't see very many

00:17:13.795 --> 00:17:14.670
ancient ones.
 

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.710
The reason for that--we'll come
to that,

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.568
when we get to the evolution of
sex--

00:17:19.568 --> 00:17:23.055
is that both because of
mutations and because of

00:17:23.055 --> 00:17:26.657
pathogens,
sex repairs damage and defends

00:17:26.657 --> 00:17:29.210
the organism against attack.
 

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:34.325
So this is a low maintenance,
poorly defended organism,

00:17:34.325 --> 00:17:39.724
and it looks like it's been
around without sex for perhaps

00:17:39.724 --> 00:17:41.808
300 million years.
 

00:17:41.808 --> 00:17:44.769
The scandal is we don't know
how it did it.

00:17:44.769 --> 00:17:46.210
Okay?
 

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.099
That's why it's called a
scandalous ancient asexual.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.480
Yes, that's a very intellectual
definition of scandal;

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.869
I agree.
 

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:00.430
Okay, sexual diploids.
 

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.211
You guys are sexual diploids,
this bee is a sexual diploid,

00:18:04.211 --> 00:18:06.690
and that flower is a sexual
diploid.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.374
They have this kind of
lifecycle, as is sketched here,

00:18:09.374 --> 00:18:11.298
the one that I talked about
earlier.

00:18:11.298 --> 00:18:15.548
So about twenty animal phyla
are sexual diploids.

00:18:15.548 --> 00:18:18.707
Many plants,
most multi-cellular plants are,

00:18:18.707 --> 00:18:22.451
and there are some algae
protozoa and fungi that are

00:18:22.451 --> 00:18:23.920
sexual diploids.
 

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:31.000
They include the malaria and
sleeping sickness pathogens.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.818
There are some things that
don't fit;

00:18:32.818 --> 00:18:38.185
the sexual diploid part doesn't
fit, for malaria and sleeping

00:18:38.185 --> 00:18:39.170
sickness.
 

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.555
The things that are alternating
between being haploid and

00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:45.840
diploid,
with neither one dominating,

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.061
are mushrooms,
microsporidian parasites,

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:52.782
which are things that are
actually quite common in many

00:18:52.782 --> 00:18:56.847
insects,
and the malaria--malaria has a

00:18:56.847 --> 00:18:59.440
very complex lifecycle.
 

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.817
So it is haploid inside your
red blood cells,

00:19:03.817 --> 00:19:08.296
it's diploid at a certain point
in a mosquito,

00:19:08.296 --> 00:19:11.778
and it's moving back and forth.
 

00:19:11.778 --> 00:19:15.804
The things that alternate
sexual and asexual reproduction:

00:19:15.804 --> 00:19:18.627
there are some rotifers,
some cnidarians,

00:19:18.627 --> 00:19:21.170
some water fleas,
some annelids.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.259
There's a great little annelid
that lives in the bottom of the

00:19:25.259 --> 00:19:28.344
Harbor of Naples in Italy,
and it actually does

00:19:28.344 --> 00:19:29.348
everything.
 

00:19:29.348 --> 00:19:33.640
It can be asexual--the same
species--it can be asexual;

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.450
it can be born as a female and
turn into a male;

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.500
it can be born as a male and
turn into a female;

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.368
and it can be born as both and
do both.

00:19:40.368 --> 00:19:44.885
So some things are really
flexible, but most things

00:19:44.885 --> 00:19:45.700
aren't.
 

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:51.470
And the timing of sexuality and
asexuality is an important part

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:55.380
of the lifecycle of all of these
things.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.297
Last fall, for example,
there were huge jellyfish

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.848
blooms over much of the world's
oceans,

00:20:00.848 --> 00:20:05.913
and that's part of a complex
lifecycle in which there is an

00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:09.670
asexual phase on the floor of
the ocean,

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:13.240
that builds up what looks like
a stack of dinner plates,

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.308
and then the top plate flips
off and turns into a jellyfish.

00:20:17.308 --> 00:20:20.868
It goes off as a jellyfish and
has sex and makes larvae,

00:20:20.868 --> 00:20:23.730
and then goes down and turns
into an asexual thing on the

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.980
bottom that makes stacks of
dinner plates.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.818
So there's a lot of variety out
there.

00:20:29.818 --> 00:20:35.470
All of these things probably
evolved from an asexual haploid;

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:41.750
and we say that because we
believe that the bacterial state

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.000
was the ancestral condition.
 

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.568
Okay, now genetics constrains
evolution,

00:20:49.568 --> 00:20:54.179
and genetics is doing something
to evolutionary thought which is

00:20:54.179 --> 00:20:58.348
about what chemistry does to
metabolism and structure,

00:20:58.348 --> 00:21:01.650
and is about what physics does
to chemistry.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:02.650
Okay?
 

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.680
There's a broad analogy there.
 

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.147
If you want to understand
molecular and cell biology,

00:21:07.147 --> 00:21:08.618
you learn a lot of chemistry.
 

00:21:08.618 --> 00:21:11.806
If you want to understand some
evolution, then you need to

00:21:11.806 --> 00:21:15.048
learn a little bit about how
genetics constrains evolution,

00:21:15.048 --> 00:21:16.950
and so you need a little math.
 

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:21.356
So I'm going to give you some
simple math, and here's some

00:21:21.356 --> 00:21:23.288
terminology to soak up.
 

00:21:23.288 --> 00:21:28.609
So we're going to represent
these ideas by symbols.

00:21:28.609 --> 00:21:31.910
We're going to call alleles Aa.
 

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.348
So those are two alleles at one
locus;

00:21:34.348 --> 00:21:37.558
a little exercise of genetic
terminology.

00:21:37.558 --> 00:21:40.612
We're going to let p be the
frequency of A1,

00:21:40.612 --> 00:21:42.598
and q the frequency of A2.
 

00:21:42.598 --> 00:21:47.288
And frequency just means the
following: some traits are

00:21:47.288 --> 00:21:52.413
Mendelian, which means that
they're easily recognized in the

00:21:52.413 --> 00:21:53.630
phenotype.
 

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:57.048
One of the Mendelian traits in
humans is the ability to curl

00:21:57.048 --> 00:21:57.859
your tongue.
 

00:21:57.859 --> 00:21:59.349
I am a tongue curler.
 

00:21:59.349 --> 00:22:00.798
Okay?
 

00:22:00.798 --> 00:22:04.279
How many of you can curl your
tongues?

00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:06.798
Okay, let's say it's about 45.
 

00:22:06.798 --> 00:22:09.930
How many of you cannot curl
your tongues?

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.980
Let's say it's about 30.
 

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:17.838
So the frequency of tongue
curling is going to be--I'm just

00:22:17.838 --> 00:22:22.890
making up the numbers,
right?--45 divided by 75.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.720
That's how we get the number.
 

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.650
And by the way,
the frequency of the other one

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:34.628
is going to be 1 minus that
frequency, because p plus q is

00:22:34.628 --> 00:22:37.483
equal to 1;
and we'll let s be the

00:22:37.483 --> 00:22:41.027
selection coefficient,
which is measuring the

00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:46.009
reproductive success of the
organism carrying this trait,

00:22:46.009 --> 00:22:47.640
the difference that it makes.
 

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.987
And if we look at the genetic
change in asexual haploids,

00:22:52.987 --> 00:22:58.430
basically what one does is make
a table of the process;

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.851
and it is moving from young,
in the present generation,

00:23:01.851 --> 00:23:04.638
through the adult stage,
to young in the next

00:23:04.638 --> 00:23:05.588
generation.
 

00:23:05.588 --> 00:23:07.990
So we try to go through one
generation.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:11.538
This is an active Cartesian
reduction.

00:23:11.538 --> 00:23:14.282
We're taking a complex process
and breaking it down into the

00:23:14.282 --> 00:23:17.400
parts that are essential for the
thing that we're thinking about.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.105
We have genotype
frequencies--for genotypes A1

00:23:21.105 --> 00:23:26.460
and A2 they're p and q--and we
have relative fitnesses up here.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.971
The only place that selection
is making any difference,

00:23:29.971 --> 00:23:32.638
on this whole page that's in
front of you,

00:23:32.638 --> 00:23:33.808
is right here.
 

00:23:33.808 --> 00:23:38.164
And basically what--our placing
that there is an act that means

00:23:38.164 --> 00:23:39.288
the following.
 

00:23:39.288 --> 00:23:43.262
We are only going to think
about the case in which there is

00:23:43.262 --> 00:23:46.619
some difference in the juvenile
survival of A2;

00:23:46.619 --> 00:23:48.779
it's different from A1.
 

00:23:48.779 --> 00:23:52.460
If it makes it to adulthood,
there's no difference;

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.368
we don't put that down in the
table.

00:23:54.368 --> 00:23:56.550
So this is a case where we're
just--you know,

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.673
it's a special case--we're just
looking at the juvenile survival

00:23:59.673 --> 00:24:01.309
difference between A1 and A2.
 

00:24:01.309 --> 00:24:03.440
What happens?
 

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.680
Well it changes the frequencies
of A1 and A2 in the adults.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.960
Basically it changes them by
reducing the number of A2s.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.748
Some of them have died out;
that's 1 minus s,

00:24:15.748 --> 00:24:18.538
that's what the 1 minus s is
doing.

00:24:18.538 --> 00:24:21.971
You can take these expressions
here and you can simplify them

00:24:21.971 --> 00:24:25.166
so they look like this--
it's just a little bit of

00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:29.470
algebra--and because these are
the frequencies in the adults,

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:32.093
the young in the next
generation have exactly those

00:24:32.093 --> 00:24:35.319
frequencies,
because there is no selective

00:24:35.319 --> 00:24:37.930
difference in the adult stage.
 

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.630
Okay?
 

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.190
That's what that table means.
 

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:44.450
Now a little bit about this.
 

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.848
This little process that I've
gone through,

00:24:46.848 --> 00:24:49.994
which probably looks like
remarkably simplistic

00:24:49.994 --> 00:24:53.060
bookkeeping to you,
is actually the part of doing

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.700
applied mathematics which is the
most difficult.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.309
It is the translation of a
process into something

00:24:59.309 --> 00:25:02.769
analytically simple,
that you can deal with.

00:25:02.769 --> 00:25:06.448
In the act of doing it,
you make certain assumptions to

00:25:06.448 --> 00:25:09.643
simplify the situation,
and by writing them down it

00:25:09.643 --> 00:25:12.541
helps you to remember what
assumptions you made and what

00:25:12.541 --> 00:25:14.440
thing you're actually looking
at.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.865
We're not looking at all of
evolution here,

00:25:15.865 --> 00:25:17.190
we're looking at a very special
case;

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.623
we're looking at asexual
haploids where selective

00:25:19.623 --> 00:25:21.548
differences only occur in
juveniles.

00:25:21.548 --> 00:25:25.512
What happens is you get a
change in the gene frequencies

00:25:25.512 --> 00:25:28.900
of the adults that result from
that process,

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:33.637
and then that exact change is
passed on to the next

00:25:33.637 --> 00:25:34.868
generation.
 

00:25:34.868 --> 00:25:37.486
So that's the part of this
process that I want you to

00:25:37.486 --> 00:25:38.038
remember.
 

00:25:38.038 --> 00:25:40.420
You can go look this stuff up
any time.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.269
You don't need to memorize that.
 

00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:45.730
You can program this as
recursion equations and apply

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:46.930
them repeatedly.
 

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.940
Okay?
 

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.490
Now let's do it for sexual
diploids.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:56.223
In the sexual diploids,
you've already been exposed to

00:25:56.223 --> 00:26:00.778
the Hardy-Weinberg Law,
this p^(2) 2pq q^(2) law.

00:26:00.778 --> 00:26:03.647
In order to get it,
we have to assume random mating

00:26:03.647 --> 00:26:04.910
in a big population.
 

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.729
The reason you need the big
population is so that those p's

00:26:08.729 --> 00:26:11.430
and q's are actually accurate
measures.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.957
In a small population they're
noisy, but in a big population

00:26:14.957 --> 00:26:16.930
they are good stable estimates.
 

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:20.190
And if there's random mating,
that means that matings are

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:23.450
occurring in proportion to the
frequency of each type.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.180
So you get a Punnet diagram
like this.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:31.358
You have the probability of one
of these alleles occurring;

00:26:31.358 --> 00:26:35.446
and one parent is going to p,
the other allele in that parent

00:26:35.446 --> 00:26:35.720
q.
 

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.210
Same for the other parent.
 

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:40.849
These are the possible zygotes
that will result from that.

00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:47.910
This one has probability p^(2;
)this one has probability q^(2);

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.598
and these two together have
probability 2pq.

00:26:51.598 --> 00:26:56.380
That's just simple basic
probability theory.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:01.685
Now, the important thing about
the Hardy-Weinberg Law is that

00:27:01.685 --> 00:27:06.549
it implies that there's no
change from one generation to

00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:07.700
the next.
 

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:12.000
The gene frequencies under
Hardy-Weinberg don't change.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.229
That means that the information
that's been accumulated on what

00:27:17.229 --> 00:27:22.288
works in the population doesn't
change for random reasons.

00:27:22.288 --> 00:27:25.307
If it's going to change,
it's going to change because

00:27:25.307 --> 00:27:28.500
that big population is going to
come under selection.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.838
Okay?
 

00:27:30.838 --> 00:27:35.076
That means that replication is
accurate and fair,

00:27:35.076 --> 00:27:40.372
at the level of the population,
just as it is at the level of

00:27:40.372 --> 00:27:41.519
the cell.
 

00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:43.420
Now, of course,
gene drift is going on,

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.848
but we're not so worried here
about gene drift,

00:27:45.848 --> 00:27:48.381
because gene drift is affecting
things that aren't making a

00:27:48.381 --> 00:27:50.772
difference to selection,
and we're building models of

00:27:50.772 --> 00:27:51.250
selection.
 

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:55.946
What Hardy-Weinberg does is
tell you if there isn't any

00:27:55.946 --> 00:27:58.727
drift,
if there isn't any mutation,

00:27:58.727 --> 00:28:02.535
if there isn't any selection,
if there isn't any migration in

00:28:02.535 --> 00:28:05.726
the population,
and if you don't have a high

00:28:05.726 --> 00:28:08.580
mutation rate,
things are going to stay the

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:08.910
same.
 

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.221
So if they're changing,
one of those things is making a

00:28:12.221 --> 00:28:13.019
difference.
 

00:28:13.019 --> 00:28:13.319
Okay?
 

00:28:13.319 --> 00:28:14.818
And that gives us a baseline.
 

00:28:14.818 --> 00:28:19.234
So it gives us a baseline to
see the process of selection

00:28:19.234 --> 00:28:22.050
occurring,
but it also means that random

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:25.509
mating in large populations
preserves information on what

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:26.868
worked in the past.
 

00:28:26.868 --> 00:28:30.028
So you don't have to invent
everything all over again.

00:28:30.028 --> 00:28:34.684
And a note for future lectures,
these are also the conditions

00:28:34.684 --> 00:28:38.410
that remove conflict by
guaranteeing fairness.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:42.133
So basically the Hardy-Weinberg
situation is one in which

00:28:42.133 --> 00:28:45.856
everything that was in the
population last generation has

00:28:45.856 --> 00:28:48.982
exactly the same chance of
getting into the next

00:28:48.982 --> 00:28:52.170
generation,
in proportion to its frequency;

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.808
nothing is going to change.
 

00:28:54.808 --> 00:28:57.029
Okay, here's a genetic
counseling problem,

00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:59.519
and I'm going to take a little
time on this.

00:28:59.519 --> 00:29:02.990
We go back to John and Jill.
 

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:06.712
They've fallen in love,
they want to get married,

00:29:06.712 --> 00:29:08.420
but they're worried.
 

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.752
John's brother died of a
genetic disease,

00:29:11.752 --> 00:29:13.920
and that is a nasty one.
 

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.618
It's recessive,
it's lethal,

00:29:15.618 --> 00:29:19.460
it kills anybody that carries
it before they can reproduce.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.598
That's fact one.
 

00:29:21.598 --> 00:29:26.516
Jill doesn't have any special
history of this disease in her

00:29:26.516 --> 00:29:28.720
family,
but that history's not well

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.664
known, and so we estimate the
probability that Jill carries

00:29:31.664 --> 00:29:34.405
the disease from the frequency
of deaths in the general

00:29:34.405 --> 00:29:37.400
population,
and that frequency is 1%;

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.599
to make it easier for you to
calculate.

00:29:39.599 --> 00:29:40.910
Okay?
 

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.994
What's the probability that
they will have a child that dies

00:29:44.994 --> 00:29:47.279
from this disease in childhood?
 

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:48.779
The probability is .03.
 

00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:53.799
Your problem is not to tell me
.03, your problem is to tell me

00:29:53.799 --> 00:29:56.269
why did I use that equation?
 

00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:57.630
Okay?
 

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:00.304
So take a look at that equation
for a minute,

00:30:00.304 --> 00:30:03.769
take a look at that problem,
and let's go through and pull

00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:04.559
it apart.
 

00:30:11.298 --> 00:30:16.917
Can anybody see why either the
two-thirds or the one-quarter is

00:30:16.917 --> 00:30:18.548
in the equation?
 

00:30:18.548 --> 00:30:23.647
Student:  We know that
his brother has a recessive

00:30:23.647 --> 00:30:28.480
version of the lethal gene,
and therefore John is either

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.932
heterozygous-- doesn't look like
it's dominant,

00:30:31.932 --> 00:30:34.108
looks like it's recessive.
 

00:30:34.108 --> 00:30:37.673
So if he is heterozygous or
homozygous recessive,

00:30:37.673 --> 00:30:40.614
then he's carrying the gene;
which is what we're worried

00:30:40.614 --> 00:30:40.798
about.
 

00:30:40.798 --> 00:30:44.282
So there's a two-thirds chance
that he is either carrying it or

00:30:44.282 --> 00:30:45.799
actually has the disease.
 

00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:46.818
Prof: That's correct.
 

00:30:46.818 --> 00:30:50.667
The only slip you made in
expressing that is that we know

00:30:50.667 --> 00:30:54.930
that if they are going to have a
child that has the defect,

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:57.875
they both must be heterozygous,
and so we're concentrating

00:30:57.875 --> 00:31:00.461
specifically on what's the
probability that they're

00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:01.338
heterozygous.
 

00:31:01.338 --> 00:31:03.038
You then gave me that
probability.

00:31:03.038 --> 00:31:10.222
Does anybody have a problem
seeing why the probability that

00:31:10.222 --> 00:31:17.160
John is a heterozygote is
two-thirds, rather than 50%;

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.859
excuse me, that the baby is a
heterozygote is two-thirds?

00:31:21.859 --> 00:31:23.130
Yes?
 

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:24.782
Student: So we're going
to keep him as a

00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:25.789
&gt;.
 

00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:26.910
Prof: Yes, you do.
 

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:27.589
Okay.
 

00:31:27.589 --> 00:31:28.519
This is for the baby.
 

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:30.700
Okay?
 

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.875
If John is a heterozygote and
if Jill is a heterozygote,

00:31:34.875 --> 00:31:38.138
they can have either a
homozygous recessive,

00:31:38.138 --> 00:31:41.098
and that one will die before
birth;

00:31:41.098 --> 00:31:44.849
they can have a homozygous
dominant, perfectly healthy;

00:31:44.849 --> 00:31:47.598
or they can have a heterozygote.
 

00:31:47.598 --> 00:31:51.058
The probability of the
homozygote recessive is 25%,

00:31:51.058 --> 00:31:54.450
the probability of the
homozygous dominant is 25%,

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.980
and the probability of the
heterozygote is 50%.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:05.351
But, the probability that John
and Jill will have a baby that

00:32:05.351 --> 00:32:11.371
dies from this disease in
childhood is going to be

00:32:11.371 --> 00:32:15.180
therefore this one-quarter.
 

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:24.132
This two-thirds is going to be
the probability that John is a

00:32:24.132 --> 00:32:26.368
heterozygote.
 

00:32:26.368 --> 00:32:30.251
How do we know that
John--John's parents were both

00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:31.519
heterozygotes?
 

00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:34.380
Student:  They had a
recessive son.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.450
Prof: They had a
recessive son.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.470
John's parents had to be
heterozygotes.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:42.648
Therefore, given that John's
parents were heterozygotes,

00:32:42.648 --> 00:32:44.500
his probability is two-thirds.
 

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:48.539
We know he survived to
adulthood;

00:32:48.539 --> 00:32:51.940
the other 25% died.
 

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.951
So of those who survived to
adulthood, two-thirds are

00:32:55.951 --> 00:32:59.500
heterozygotes and one-third are
homozygotes.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:09.375
Student:  Why can't one
be homozygote recessive and the

00:33:09.375 --> 00:33:13.585
other one be heterozygous?
 

00:33:13.585 --> 00:33:18.279
&gt;.
 

00:33:18.279 --> 00:33:22.269
Prof: Because if one,
the parent--if one parent was a

00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:24.373
homozygote,
it could only have been

00:33:24.373 --> 00:33:27.035
homozygous dominant,
because it survived to

00:33:27.035 --> 00:33:28.848
adulthood, to have a child.
 

00:33:28.848 --> 00:33:30.799
And if the other parent was a
heterozygote,

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:33.818
the only possibilities for the
children are both heterozygotes;

00:33:33.818 --> 00:33:36.769
and that wasn't the case,
because John's brother died.

00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:41.048
Okay?
 

00:33:41.048 --> 00:33:47.519
So this is the probability that
John is a heterozygote.

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:52.833
This is the probability that if
John and Jill have a baby,

00:33:52.833 --> 00:33:55.348
it will have the problem.
 

00:33:55.348 --> 00:34:00.798
What's this thing in the
middle--2 times 0.9 times 0.1?

00:34:00.798 --> 00:34:02.680
Student:
&gt;

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.578
Prof: Right.
 

00:34:03.578 --> 00:34:10.221
That's the probability that
Jill is a heterozygote,

00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:13.940
and we get that from here.
 

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:19.449
The square root of 1% is .1.
 

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:24.030
1 minus .1 is .9.
 

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:29.539
This is q and this is p and
this is 2pq.

00:34:29.539 --> 00:34:31.610
Okay?
 

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.570
Where did we get this from?
 

00:34:45.809 --> 00:34:48.110
That's in Jill's part of the
population.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.449
Those are the baby--oh you've
got it.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:54.132
Student:  The
probability has to be out of the

00:34:54.132 --> 00:34:56.556
entire population,
and the long-term population,

00:34:56.556 --> 00:34:59.289
they can't reproduce--
&gt;.

00:34:59.289 --> 00:35:00.500
Prof: Right.
 

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.985
So we have to correct the
percentages for the ones that

00:35:03.985 --> 00:35:04.760
have died.
 

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.500
Yes, you got it.
 

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:15.583
Do you see how much goes into
dissecting an equation like

00:35:15.583 --> 00:35:16.469
that?
 

00:35:16.469 --> 00:35:20.940
But because we've set up the
logical apparatus,

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.070
we can go through a sequence of
steps and say,

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:27.789
"Okay, first we know they
both have to be heterozygous.

00:35:27.789 --> 00:35:30.295
Then, if they are both
heterozygous,

00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:33.590
the probability that Jack is,
is two-thirds;

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:38.025
the probability that Jill is,
is 2pq, corrected for the fact

00:35:38.025 --> 00:35:39.530
that 1% have died.
 

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:42.010
She has survived,
so we have to correct for that.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.697
Then this is the probability
that their baby has the

00:35:44.697 --> 00:35:45.539
disease."
 

00:35:45.539 --> 00:35:51.255
That's the kind of process that
one goes through when thinking

00:35:51.255 --> 00:35:53.880
about population genetics.
 

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:58.306
This is the table for sexual
diploids that reflects this kind

00:35:58.306 --> 00:35:59.340
of thinking.
 

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:04.835
It is more complicated because
now we have to keep track of

00:36:04.835 --> 00:36:09.099
both the haploid and the diploid
condition.

00:36:09.099 --> 00:36:13.126
So we have these haploid
gametes, with frequencies p and

00:36:13.126 --> 00:36:13.420
q.
 

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.309
We have the diploid zygotes.
 

00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:21.050
Then another process comes in.
 

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.739
We can have a selective
difference--I made a S here;

00:36:23.739 --> 00:36:25.750
I made a -S in the last one.
 

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.032
I made that change
deliberately,

00:36:27.032 --> 00:36:28.730
just so that you'd see it as
arbitrary;

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:32.019
because we can make S negative
or positive itself.

00:36:32.019 --> 00:36:33.239
Right?
 

00:36:33.239 --> 00:36:36.500
S doesn't have to be a positive
number;

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.989
neither does H.
 

00:36:37.989 --> 00:36:45.780
Anybody have an idea what H
might be in there for?

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.974
It's in there to represent
something that's going on in

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:50.829
genetics.
 

00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:51.820
Yes?
 

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:52.340
Student:  Is it
heritability?

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.061
Prof: No it's not
heritability,

00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:54.900
in this context.
 

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.449
Okay?
 

00:36:56.449 --> 00:36:57.449
Yes?
 

00:36:57.449 --> 00:37:02.789
Student:  Is it the
Marsh's coefficient for being

00:37:02.789 --> 00:37:04.050
heterozygous?
 

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.768
&gt;
 

00:37:06.768 --> 00:37:09.300
Prof: Not in this
context.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.800
Good idea, but no.
 

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.079
What is it about that
heterozygote that doesn't

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:15.510
necessarily have anything to do
with selection?

00:37:19.389 --> 00:37:21.989
H expresses dominance.
 

00:37:21.989 --> 00:37:30.115
It expresses the degree to
which A1 is covering up A2 in

00:37:30.115 --> 00:37:32.480
the phenotype.
 

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.610
Dominance itself is not
something that's always there.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:41.460
If there isn't any dominance,
then the heterozygote is just

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:46.730
exactly halfway in the phenotype
between the two homozygotes.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.322
So H is a little mathematical
symbol that allows us to deal

00:37:50.322 --> 00:37:54.038
with situations in which either
there's a lot of dominance or

00:37:54.038 --> 00:37:55.030
none at all.
 

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:58.179
If H = 0, there's no dominance.
 

00:37:58.179 --> 00:38:07.469
Okay?
 

00:38:07.469 --> 00:38:10.199
No excuse me,
the way it's set up,

00:38:10.199 --> 00:38:13.923
if H = 0, then A1,
A2 is just exactly like A1,

00:38:13.923 --> 00:38:16.489
A1, and there is dominance.
 

00:38:16.489 --> 00:38:19.891
So we have to make H something
non-zero, in order to express

00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:23.119
deviations from dominance,
the way this one is set up.

00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:25.586
At any rate,
the--what's going on here is

00:38:25.586 --> 00:38:28.610
essentially the same kind of
selection process.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:32.110
There is a selective
difference, which is

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.860
disadvantaging A2.
 

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.440
So A2 doesn't survive as well
as A1.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.594
When it is in the heterozygous
form, it may do better,

00:38:41.594 --> 00:38:43.789
if there's some dominance.
 

00:38:43.789 --> 00:38:49.570
And that results in a more
complicated set of equations.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:53.389
W here is defined as this big
term.

00:38:53.389 --> 00:38:58.996
We have basically the adults
being p^(2), 2 pq times 1 plus

00:38:58.996 --> 00:38:59.480
hs.
 

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:04.396
And A2, A2 has a frequency of
q^(2) times 1 plus s,

00:39:04.396 --> 00:39:09.018
which is the selection
coefficient over here.

00:39:09.018 --> 00:39:14.710
So q is changing the most,
and to the degree that A2 can

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:20.320
be seen in the heterozygote,
it will also be affected by s,

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.880
but it won't be affected if
there is complete dominance.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.059
Okay?
 

00:39:26.059 --> 00:39:30.523
So if h is zero,
there's no effect of selection

00:39:30.523 --> 00:39:34.530
on the heterozygote;
this term cancels out.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:38.335
The result of that is that you
get these frequencies forming

00:39:38.335 --> 00:39:39.820
the next generations.
 

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.554
Now there a couple of ways of
setting up this whole

00:39:42.554 --> 00:39:44.898
derivation,
and in the Second Edition of

00:39:44.898 --> 00:39:47.726
the book,
Box 4.1 and Box 4.2 do it a

00:39:47.726 --> 00:39:49.690
little bit differently.
 

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:53.559
You might want to just step
through those things in section.

00:39:53.559 --> 00:39:57.382
The goal here is not to
memorize how to derive the

00:39:57.382 --> 00:40:00.659
equations, or to memorize the
equations.

00:40:00.659 --> 00:40:03.514
Because, as I've said,
you can always pick them up in

00:40:03.514 --> 00:40:06.697
a book, or pull them off the
web, and you can find programs

00:40:06.697 --> 00:40:08.510
that will do it all the time.
 

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.708
The goal is to understand what
it is that population

00:40:11.708 --> 00:40:15.409
geneticists are thinking about
when they set it up this way,

00:40:15.409 --> 00:40:17.480
and what power it gives them.
 

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.836
So let me just show you what
happens when you program these

00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:23.489
recursion equations.
 

00:40:23.489 --> 00:40:26.726
By the way, they're called
recursion equations because they

00:40:26.726 --> 00:40:30.074
give us the frequency in the
next generation as a function of

00:40:30.074 --> 00:40:32.139
the frequency in this
generation.

00:40:32.139 --> 00:40:35.219
So they form kind of a Markov
chain.

00:40:35.219 --> 00:40:38.510
They allow us to calculate next
time from this time;

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:41.530
that's something computers are
really good at.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:46.101
So this is the take-home
message of all that analysis:

00:40:46.101 --> 00:40:49.831
you look at genetic change,
in asexual haploids,

00:40:49.831 --> 00:40:53.539
sexual diploids,
and it's slow at the beginning,

00:40:53.539 --> 00:40:56.780
fast in the middle;
it's slow at the end.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.411
The haploids change faster than
the diploids,

00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:02.639
and the dominants change faster
than the recessives.

00:41:02.639 --> 00:41:06.795
So let's step through that and
see if you can tell me why this

00:41:06.795 --> 00:41:07.750
is the case.
 

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:12.673
First let's take the asexual
haploids, or haploids of any

00:41:12.673 --> 00:41:13.289
kind.
 

00:41:13.289 --> 00:41:17.536
Why is it that haploids change
gene frequencies faster,

00:41:17.536 --> 00:41:21.469
for given selection pressures,
than do diploids?

00:41:21.469 --> 00:41:22.940
Yes?
 

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.521
Student: The entire
gene--all the genes are

00:41:26.521 --> 00:41:27.253
inherited.
 

00:41:27.253 --> 00:41:30.032
It's not all
&gt;;

00:41:30.032 --> 00:41:33.175
it's sort of a complete
replication of them,

00:41:33.175 --> 00:41:34.420
the order.
 

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.554
Prof: Well that is what
a haploid is,

00:41:36.554 --> 00:41:38.690
but that doesn't explain why
it's faster.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:42.329
The statement is true,
but it's not an answer to my

00:41:42.329 --> 00:41:43.130
question.
 

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:44.380
Another try.
 

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.179
Yes?
 

00:41:46.179 --> 00:41:52.833
Student:  Well all the
&gt;

00:41:52.833 --> 00:41:55.789
, the bad genes die off.
 

00:41:55.789 --> 00:41:59.239
&gt;
 

00:41:59.239 --> 00:42:01.349
Prof: Okay,
that's going in the right

00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:04.440
direction, but I think it can be
expressed even more clearly.

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.239
Yes?
 

00:42:05.239 --> 00:42:15.480
Student: 
&gt;

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.329
Prof: That's interesting.
 

00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:19.719
That actually gets into the
evolution of sex.

00:42:19.719 --> 00:42:22.811
I'm actually thinking though
about an answer that has more to

00:42:22.811 --> 00:42:25.902
do with developmental biology
and not so much to do with sex,

00:42:25.902 --> 00:42:26.829
at this point.
 

00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:32.242
Um, actually I think that,
uh, your answer is partially

00:42:32.242 --> 00:42:37.155
correct, but it's more
complicated than what I was

00:42:37.155 --> 00:42:38.760
looking for.
 

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.230
&gt;
 

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:42.090
Yes?
 

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:50.639
Student:  Is it that all
asexuals can reproduce?

00:42:50.639 --> 00:42:52.289
Prof: No,
it's not that all of the

00:42:52.289 --> 00:42:53.320
asexuals can reproduce.
 

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.039
Many of them die as juveniles.
 

00:42:56.039 --> 00:42:59.170
It has to do with haploidy
versus diploidy.

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:00.030
Yes?
 

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:03.052
Student:  Then if the
organism has the allele that's

00:43:03.052 --> 00:43:04.719
different, it's going to best.
 

00:43:04.719 --> 00:43:05.860
Prof: Yes.
 

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.469
Student: And that's when
this other comes along.

00:43:07.469 --> 00:43:11.179
Prof: Every gene is
expressed, and there's no

00:43:11.179 --> 00:43:15.179
dominance covering up any hidden
genetic information.

00:43:15.179 --> 00:43:18.840
The genes are exposed to
selection, in haploids.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.590
Yes?
 

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:23.173
Student:  So why is that
faster than a dominant zygote,

00:43:23.173 --> 00:43:24.820
&gt;?
 

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.329
Prof: Good.
 

00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:29.949
We'll find out as we go through
the next questions.

00:43:29.949 --> 00:43:30.679
Okay?
 

00:43:30.679 --> 00:43:36.949
So the haploids are faster than
a dominant diploid because--?

00:43:36.949 --> 00:43:44.005
Student:
&gt;.

00:43:44.005 --> 00:43:50.030
That's why it's a recessive
gene.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.619
Prof: Basically, yes.
 

00:43:52.619 --> 00:43:55.952
The heterozygotes react like
the dominant,

00:43:55.952 --> 00:43:58.230
but contain the recessive.
 

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:01.041
And so if you're measuring the
rate of evolution as the rate at

00:44:01.041 --> 00:44:03.219
which the dominant takes over
the population,

00:44:03.219 --> 00:44:06.925
it's carrying along in the
heterozygotes a bunch of

00:44:06.925 --> 00:44:07.889
recessives.
 

00:44:07.889 --> 00:44:08.460
Okay?
 

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.820
They're doing just as well as
it is.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.458
So development,
which is covering up the

00:44:12.458 --> 00:44:15.655
difference between the two,
is actually giving the

00:44:15.655 --> 00:44:18.679
recessives an advantage and
slowing down the rate at which

00:44:18.679 --> 00:44:20.269
the dominant can take over.
 

00:44:20.269 --> 00:44:22.250
Okay?
 

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:26.340
Recessive diploid;
I think that you now see why

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.300
that would be the slowest.
 

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:33.590
If we have an advantageous
recessive gene,

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:37.764
it gets slowed down by the fact
that when it's in the

00:44:37.764 --> 00:44:41.884
heterozygote,
its effects are being covered

00:44:41.884 --> 00:44:44.230
up by the other allele.
 

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:50.460
Okay, why is it S-shaped?
 

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:56.400
Why is the trait--let's do it
for a dominant diploid sexual.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.610
Okay?
 

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:01.063
Slow at the beginning,
fast in the middle,

00:45:01.063 --> 00:45:03.170
really slow at the end.
 

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:06.599
Let's concentrate on first why
this is really slow at the end,

00:45:06.599 --> 00:45:09.550
and then we can also look at
why a recessive diploid sexual

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:11.280
is really slow at the beginning.
 

00:45:16.179 --> 00:45:22.860
What do you have to think about
in order to pull the answer out

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.800
of that diagram?
 

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:34.186
What proportion of the
population is in heterozygous

00:45:34.186 --> 00:45:37.659
form, as you get near the end?
 

00:45:37.659 --> 00:45:44.342
If you're a dominant diploid
sexual and you're at a frequency

00:45:44.342 --> 00:45:50.579
of .9,81% of you are going to be
dominant homozygotes;

00:45:50.579 --> 00:45:55.570
18% of you are going to be
heterozygotes;

00:45:55.570 --> 00:46:01.090
and 1% of you are going to be
recessive.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:05.793
There are eighteen times as
many heterozygotes as there are

00:46:05.793 --> 00:46:07.739
recessive homozygotes.
 

00:46:07.739 --> 00:46:11.623
Selection, at that point,
is trying to eliminate that 1%

00:46:11.623 --> 00:46:13.530
of recessive homozygotes.
 

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:17.380
It can't touch the 18%.
 

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:21.503
If you carry that process over,
where we're dealing with .01

00:46:21.503 --> 00:46:24.090
and .99, it gets even more
extreme.

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:29.818
A tinier and tinier fraction of
that population is a recessive

00:46:29.818 --> 00:46:31.039
homozygote.
 

00:46:31.039 --> 00:46:35.079
A larger and larger fraction of
the remaining recessive alleles

00:46:35.079 --> 00:46:39.119
are tied up in heterozygotes,
where selection can't operate.

00:46:39.119 --> 00:46:41.210
So this thing just slows way
down.

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:44.327
It gets harder and harder to
get rid of the disadvantageous

00:46:44.327 --> 00:46:46.510
alleles,
because a larger and larger

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:49.039
proportion of them--
not an absolute number but a

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:52.139
larger proportion of them--
are hidden in the heterozygotes.

00:46:52.139 --> 00:46:58.275
The same thinking describes why
evolutionary change in a

00:46:58.275 --> 00:47:01.764
recessive diploid,
where the recessive gene has

00:47:01.764 --> 00:47:04.119
the advantage,
is very slow at the beginning.

00:47:04.119 --> 00:47:07.509
If a new recessive mutation
comes into the population,

00:47:07.509 --> 00:47:09.300
it's a very low frequency.
 

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.612
Its frequency is 1 divided by
the number of individuals in the

00:47:12.612 --> 00:47:13.320
population.
 

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.940
The only things it can mate
with are dominant forms.

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.909
All of its babies are
heterozygotes.

00:47:18.909 --> 00:47:24.750
So at the beginning selection
can't operate on it at all.

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:30.139
Only after two heterozygotes
manage to get together and mate,

00:47:30.139 --> 00:47:32.320
which means they must have come
to fairly high frequency,

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:36.253
will they have a baby that is a
recessive homozygote that

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:38.219
selection will operate on.
 

00:47:38.219 --> 00:47:40.429
So it takes awhile to get this
going.

00:47:40.429 --> 00:47:44.378
And because of dominance,
it takes a long time to build

00:47:44.378 --> 00:47:47.230
up to the point where it
accelerates.

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:52.543
But then at the end it's fast,
because at the end the thing

00:47:52.543 --> 00:47:57.856
that's being selected is the
recessive, and it speeds up as

00:47:57.856 --> 00:47:59.690
it goes through.
 

00:48:08.909 --> 00:48:11.510
Okay, I thought this would
happen,

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:14.072
uh, it's time for class to end,
and I'm just getting to

00:48:14.072 --> 00:48:17.485
quantitative genetics,
and so I'm going to let you

00:48:17.485 --> 00:48:22.432
pick up quantitative genetics
from the lecture notes and from

00:48:22.432 --> 00:48:23.670
the reading.
 

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:28.414
I do want to indicate as
potential paper topics though

00:48:28.414 --> 00:48:33.965
that quantitative genetics has
got some of the most interesting

00:48:33.965 --> 00:48:39.070
questions that we encounter in
evolutionary biology,

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:43.304
and that it includes questions
like the heritability of

00:48:43.304 --> 00:48:46.396
intelligence,
the heritability of SAT

00:48:46.396 --> 00:48:51.108
scores--those are all things
where the apparatus you need to

00:48:51.108 --> 00:48:56.059
analyze the issue is given to
you by quantitative genetics.

00:48:56.059 --> 00:49:01.190
And there is a good paper on
this, and I have put it up on

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:05.599
the course website,
under Recommended Readings;

00:49:05.599 --> 00:49:08.103
there's now a folder called
Recommended Readings,

00:49:08.103 --> 00:49:09.719
PDFs of Recommended Readings.
 

00:49:09.719 --> 00:49:12.139
You can find this paper and
some other ones in there,

00:49:12.139 --> 00:49:14.280
if that's something that
strikes your fancy.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:20.329
Go take a look at the title and
abstract.

00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:23.409
So this is the summary of
today's lecture.

00:49:23.409 --> 00:49:27.724
And the next time we're going
to talk about the origin and the

00:49:27.724 --> 00:49:30.199
maintenance of genetic
variation.

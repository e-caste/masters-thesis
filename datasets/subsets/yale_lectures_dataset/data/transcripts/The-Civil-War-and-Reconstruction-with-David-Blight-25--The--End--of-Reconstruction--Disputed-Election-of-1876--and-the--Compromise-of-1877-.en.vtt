00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.018
Professor David Blight:
The last book you're

00:00:05.018 --> 00:00:08.100
reading in this course is by a
great journalist,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.347
Nick Lemann.
It's called Redemption:

00:00:11.347 --> 00:00:14.560
The Last Battle of the Civil
War.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.880
There seems to be a contest
right now in writing about and

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.670
publishing about the violence of
Reconstruction.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.199
It's really been discovered by
American publishers and

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.698
certainly by American writers.
There are no less than three

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:34.335
new books out on either the
Colfax Massacre,

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:37.550
which we'll talk about in a
minute,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.728
or what Lemann does mostly in
his book, which is the story of

00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:45.280
Mississippi--sometimes called
the Shotgun Policy,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.584
sometimes called the
Mississippi Plan--but,

00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:53.383
in effect, a coup d'Ã©tat
whereby the white Democrats of

00:00:53.383 --> 00:00:57.160
Mississippi took back control of
that state,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.553
largely by terrorist violence,
political violence,

00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:05.158
in 1875.
The titles of these books

00:01:05.158 --> 00:01:07.924
strike me.
Redemption:

00:01:07.924 --> 00:01:12.200
The Last Battle of the Civil
War.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.663
Charles Lane's book,
a good journalistic popular

00:01:16.663 --> 00:01:22.171
writer, a whole book on the
Colfax Massacre entitled The

00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:27.475
Day Freedom Died--one day.
And there's another book by a

00:01:27.475 --> 00:01:30.552
young, New York private high
school teacher,

00:01:30.552 --> 00:01:34.129
proof that good books can be
written by anyone,

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:37.653
The Colfax Massacre:
The Untold Story of Black

00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:41.910
Power, White Terror and the
Death of Reconstruction.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.785
Now all those titles are true.
It's not the redemption,

00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:52.132
of course, that you hear about
in Bob Marley's Redemption

00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:55.045
Song,
but I might recommend that you

00:01:55.045 --> 00:01:58.270
put Marley on while you're
reading about this stuff.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:07.329
It might be a nice antidote.
No, I'm not going to sing it.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:13.826
But I am going to start with a
very brief little poem,

00:02:13.826 --> 00:02:20.199
one of the best illustrations
in poetry I know of,

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:24.342
of this idea that revolutions
can go backward,

00:02:24.342 --> 00:02:28.300
that revolutions usually do go
backwards,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.506
for awhile, that revolutions
always cause

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:37.370
counter-revolutions.
It's a poem by Langston Hughes.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.698
He wrote it right near the end
of his life, in 1965-- note the

00:02:42.698 --> 00:02:47.780
date.
He entitled it "Emancipation,"

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.740
and then a subtitle:
"Long View Negro."

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.278
Two simple verses:
"Emancipation,

00:02:57.278 --> 00:03:02.253
1865, sighted through the
telescope of dreams,

00:03:02.253 --> 00:03:05.349
looms larger,
so much larger,

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.439
so it seems,
than truth can be.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:16.655
But turn the telescope around,
look through the larger end,

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:22.005
and wonder why,
what was so large becomes so

00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:26.779
small again."
The metaphor is powerful,

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:30.263
if vexing.
Look through the opposite end

00:03:30.263 --> 00:03:35.050
of a telescope.
Look back at history and not

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.692
forward, and wonder why what was
such a dream,

00:03:40.692 --> 00:03:46.710
what was so large,
can become so small again.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.046
Now, when that Fifteenth
Amendment passed,

00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:55.699
that I talked about briefly the
other day,

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.584
there were just amazing
celebrations,

00:03:58.584 --> 00:04:01.790
when it was finally ratified,
in 1870,

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:09.129
all over the place.
I'll only cite a couple.

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.556
Grant in his Message to
Congress in effect said

00:04:14.556 --> 00:04:19.040
Reconstruction was now largely
over.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.542
Frederick Douglass,
though he wasn't thrilled with

00:04:21.542 --> 00:04:24.403
the fact that it was the most
conservative version of the

00:04:24.403 --> 00:04:27.875
Fifteenth Amendment and so on,
nevertheless said,

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:31.540
"We can now breathe a new
atmosphere;

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.880
we have a new earth beneath and
a new sky above."

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.180
That's a dream.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.100
One Republican newspaper called
it the nation's second birth;

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.475
second founding.
And Wendell Phillips,

00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:57.211
again the Massachusetts
abolitionist,

00:04:57.211 --> 00:05:01.314
said it was now the real
birthday of the nation because

00:05:01.314 --> 00:05:05.569
now the Declaration of
Independence applied to all.

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.732
Now, that was placing a great
deal of hope in a somewhat

00:05:10.732 --> 00:05:14.300
limited amendment,
to say the least.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.830
That's 1870.
Now go ahead just five years

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.282
with me.
This is the period now of

00:05:20.282 --> 00:05:23.278
Southern redemption,
defined of course as the

00:05:23.278 --> 00:05:26.955
Southern white Democratic
Party's counter-revolution in

00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:30.360
taking back control of its state
governments.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.060
Happens very quickly in some
Southern states.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.835
Some are redeemed as early as
1870 by the Democrats and the

00:05:38.835 --> 00:05:42.519
last three or so not until
1876/77.

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:46.224
But think of what you just
heard there, that almost

00:05:46.224 --> 00:05:49.632
unfathomable hope,
rooted in this Voting Rights

00:05:49.632 --> 00:05:52.140
Amendment,
and then listen to this

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.594
statement from the floor of
Congress by one of the most

00:05:55.594 --> 00:05:58.664
brilliant young black
politicians who got himself

00:05:58.664 --> 00:06:01.990
elected-- among those hundreds
who got elected,

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.856
among the sixteen who got
elected to Congress-- John Roy

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:10.594
Lynch, a former slave,
self-taught,

00:06:10.594 --> 00:06:15.573
he educated himself;
like Frederick Douglass there's

00:06:15.573 --> 00:06:18.629
mysteries about the brilliance
of this guy.

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.397
But he's elected to Congress
when he's twenty-six,

00:06:22.397 --> 00:06:25.781
from Mississippi,
under Mississippi's Radical

00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:29.779
Reconstruction government,
so long as it lasted.

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.468
He's still there in 1875,
and on the floor of the

00:06:33.468 --> 00:06:37.704
Congress-- which was then,
as you'll see in a moment,

00:06:37.704 --> 00:06:41.631
after the '74 Election,
now ruled by a majority of

00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:45.800
Democrats-- he looks them in the
eye and he says,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.899
"Think of it for a moment,
my colleagues.

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:52.969
When I leave my home in
Mississippi to come to the

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:56.540
capital of the nation to take
part in the deliberations of

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.491
this House,
and to participate with you in

00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:03.180
making laws for the government
of this great republic,

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.463
I am treated,
not as an American citizen,

00:07:06.463 --> 00:07:09.746
but as a brute,
forced to occupy a filthy

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:12.801
smoking car,
both night and day,

00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:16.283
with drunkards,
gamblers and criminals,

00:07:16.283 --> 00:07:19.409
and for what?
Not that I am unable or

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:23.233
unwilling to pay my way,
not that I am obnoxious in my

00:07:23.233 --> 00:07:27.129
personal appearance or
disrespectful in my conduct,

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:33.600
but simply because I happen to
be of a darker complexion."

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.720
Now here's the irony and the
point.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.295
The majority of those men he
was speaking to that day in the

00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:44.894
Congress, in their minds,
when they heard him,

00:07:44.894 --> 00:07:48.279
to the extent they listened
when he said that,

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:51.740
I think we can safely assume
were thinking,

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.940
"yeah, that's just exactly the
way you should be treated."

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:07.843
Now, to 1873 for the moment.
The day freedom died,

00:08:07.843 --> 00:08:12.549
according to Charles Lane's
book, is the day of the Colfax

00:08:12.549 --> 00:08:15.808
Massacre.
That day--I wouldn't quite say

00:08:15.808 --> 00:08:19.740
freedom died on one day,
that's a little ahistorical,

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.277
but so be it;
that's probably a publisher's

00:08:22.277 --> 00:08:23.879
title more than an author's
title.

00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:29.727
But April 14,1873 is in some
ways one of those days we could

00:08:29.727 --> 00:08:33.990
call in American history a day
of infamy.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.197
The Supreme Court that day-- at
least it's the date of the

00:08:37.197 --> 00:08:40.518
decision, even though it was
Easter Sunday-- handed down its

00:08:40.518 --> 00:08:42.208
decision,
five to four,

00:08:42.208 --> 00:08:46.556
in the Slaughterhouse Cases,
so-called, a collection of five

00:08:46.556 --> 00:08:49.210
cases that came out of
Louisiana,

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.700
which was the court's first
major ruling on the Civil War

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.470
Amendments, on the meaning of
the Thirteenth,

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:03.379
the Fourteenth and in effect
the Fifteenth Amendments.

00:09:03.379 --> 00:09:07.093
That day, the same day,
Easter Sunday,

00:09:07.093 --> 00:09:11.610
in Colfax, Louisiana--a town,
not very big,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.856
named for Schuyler Colfax,
the Vice-President of the

00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:20.019
United States in the Grant
Administration--in Grant

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:24.265
Parish--renamed by the
Republican regime for Ulysses

00:09:24.265 --> 00:09:29.178
Grant--the largest mass murder
of Americans ever in American

00:09:29.178 --> 00:09:33.434
history occurred,
in the political violence

00:09:33.434 --> 00:09:37.524
stemming from the divided
election in Louisiana,

00:09:37.524 --> 00:09:42.052
back in the fall of 1872.
Now 9/11 of course killed more

00:09:42.052 --> 00:09:44.197
Americans.
We can get caught up in

00:09:44.197 --> 00:09:47.731
categories of what is domestic
violence and foreign violence

00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:51.132
and so forth,
but this is the largest mass

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:56.279
murder of Americans in our
history, so far as we can tell.

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:59.888
That divided election produced
in effect two competing

00:09:59.888 --> 00:10:03.700
governments in Louisiana:
the Republican regime which did

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.085
win the election,
for all practical purposes,

00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:10.996
in spite of the tremendous
political violence committed

00:10:10.996 --> 00:10:14.545
against particularly black
voters in that fall '72

00:10:14.545 --> 00:10:17.994
election;
but a so-called Fusion ticket

00:10:17.994 --> 00:10:22.528
of basically a kind of white
supremacist coalition also

00:10:22.528 --> 00:10:27.230
claimed to be the legitimate
government of Louisiana.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:31.998
And in this situation of
essentially an ongoing vigilante

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:35.320
war, throughout many of the
parishes,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:41.715
counties, of Louisiana,
a standoff took place in

00:10:41.715 --> 00:10:45.909
Colfax.
I'll come back to that in a

00:10:45.909 --> 00:10:48.975
moment.
But back to the Slaughterhouse

00:10:48.975 --> 00:10:52.332
Case that came down that day.
It was, in the end,

00:10:52.332 --> 00:10:55.728
a testing of the Privileges and
Immunities Clause of the

00:10:55.728 --> 00:10:58.934
Fourteenth Amendment.
In 1869 the City of New

00:10:58.934 --> 00:11:02.384
Orleans, under its Republican
state government,

00:11:02.384 --> 00:11:06.434
created a corporation to move
the slaughterhouse of New

00:11:06.434 --> 00:11:10.184
Orleans--there actually had
never been a legitimate

00:11:10.184 --> 00:11:14.193
slaughterhouse in New Orleans.
What the butchers of New

00:11:14.193 --> 00:11:16.352
Orleans would do,
the white butchers of New

00:11:16.352 --> 00:11:18.781
Orleans would do,
is they'd herd the hogs through

00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:21.403
the streets of New Orleans and
basically they'd butcher the

00:11:21.403 --> 00:11:24.690
things wherever they wanted to,
and they always threw all

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.820
the--this gets ugly--all of the
offal from the hogs into the

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.476
Mississippi River,
up river from the city,

00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:37.799
before the river reached the
main water pipeline into the

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:40.879
city.
This had long been a problem,

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:43.600
long been a series of
complaints.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.521
And so this was an attempt at
clean government and clean

00:11:49.521 --> 00:11:52.633
cities.
The city, and the state backing

00:11:52.633 --> 00:11:55.815
it up, created a corporation
that created a new

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:58.492
slaughterhouse.
They moved it across the

00:11:58.492 --> 00:12:01.237
Mississippi River and downstream
from the city,

00:12:01.237 --> 00:12:05.830
for health reasons.
They put in a state-appointed

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:11.711
inspector, and the white
butchers of New Orleans were

00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:14.434
angry.
Some butchers and some critics

00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:17.389
charged this was a monopoly and
an unfair practice.

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:21.828
Twenty-five butchers brought
suit, with support from the

00:12:21.828 --> 00:12:25.460
reviving Democratic Party--
white butchers.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:30.046
The lower courts in this
particular suit found in favor

00:12:30.046 --> 00:12:34.362
of the new corporation.
It was appealed to the U.S.

00:12:34.362 --> 00:12:38.150
Supreme Court.
It got on the docket in '72.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:46.299
It was decided April 14,1873.
It was a five-to-four decision.

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:49.780
Seemingly on the surface,
when you read it-- it's like

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.129
many court decisions,
it's a bit boring at first;

00:12:53.129 --> 00:12:55.570
five cases from butchers and so
on and so on,

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.009
and you wonder what the hell's
this about?

00:12:58.009 --> 00:13:01.880
Then you keep reading and you
realize it became a fundamental

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.210
decision.
Justice Samuel Miller,

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.673
for the majority,
argued that the Thirteenth and

00:13:07.673 --> 00:13:11.652
Fourteenth Amendments were
intended-- this was the good

00:13:11.652 --> 00:13:15.925
part of the decision--to end
slavery and advance the rights

00:13:15.925 --> 00:13:19.762
of the freedmen.
But he made a sharp--in other

00:13:19.762 --> 00:13:24.490
words, not to protect a bunch of
white butchers in New Orleans.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.048
And by the way,
the lead lawyer,

00:13:27.048 --> 00:13:30.763
for the butchers,
in the Slaughterhouse Cases,

00:13:30.763 --> 00:13:33.899
was none other than a man named
John A.

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:38.274
Campbell, a Georgia-born,
former member of the Supreme

00:13:38.274 --> 00:13:41.657
Court.
He had been part of the six-man

00:13:41.657 --> 00:13:44.889
majority in the Dred Scott
decision of 1857;

00:13:44.889 --> 00:13:46.955
resigned his position in the
U.S.

00:13:46.955 --> 00:13:50.117
Supreme Court in 1861 to go
home and fight for the

00:13:50.117 --> 00:13:51.954
Confederacy.
He didn't fight on the

00:13:51.954 --> 00:13:54.237
battlefield;
he became Assistant Secretary

00:13:54.237 --> 00:13:57.789
of State in the Confederacy and
served in that position,

00:13:57.789 --> 00:14:01.894
and other high-ranking official
positions, in the Confederate

00:14:01.894 --> 00:14:05.110
national government throughout
the Civil War.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.249
And when the war was over he
was one of those high-ranking

00:14:08.249 --> 00:14:10.782
Confederate officials denied the
right to vote,

00:14:10.782 --> 00:14:12.929
disfranchised for up to four
years.

00:14:12.929 --> 00:14:17.313
He was part of the final set of
amnesty and pardons that Andrew

00:14:17.313 --> 00:14:21.414
Johnson enacted just before
leaving office in the spring of

00:14:21.414 --> 00:14:23.729
'69.
And Campbell had made it his

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:26.291
business, as a Redeemer now,
in the South,

00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:29.540
to thwart and fight
Reconstruction at every turn.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:34.389
He hated black suffrage.
He hated black people.

00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:36.519
He was a virulent white
supremacist.

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:41.200
He took this case on because he
wanted to crush Reconstruction.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.587
He even argued,
by the way, in the

00:14:43.587 --> 00:14:47.856
Slaughterhouse Cases-- which
Miller turned right back on his

00:14:47.856 --> 00:14:51.907
head--he even argued that the
rights of the butchers were

00:14:51.907 --> 00:14:55.669
being violated under the
Thirteenth Amendment.

00:14:55.669 --> 00:14:58.957
He said that these butchers
were now being forced into a

00:14:58.957 --> 00:15:02.483
form of involuntary servitude
because they had to take their

00:15:02.483 --> 00:15:06.129
hogs across the Mississippi and
slaughter then downriver.

00:15:06.129 --> 00:15:11.396
It was violating their right to
make a proper livelihood by

00:15:11.396 --> 00:15:14.891
their own individual choice.
And frankly,

00:15:14.891 --> 00:15:17.590
folks--I read this decision
this morning;

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:22.809
well I got through most of
it--if you want to read the

00:15:22.809 --> 00:15:28.788
origins of our modern day uses,
and some would say misuses,

00:15:28.788 --> 00:15:34.750
of civil rights language and
legislation, in our own time,

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.533
the ways in which some American
politicians, lawyers,

00:15:38.533 --> 00:15:40.570
judges, etcetera,
pundits,

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.792
etcetera, etcetera,
etcetera, have appropriated the

00:15:43.792 --> 00:15:47.595
language of the modern Civil
Rights movement--especially the

00:15:47.595 --> 00:15:51.462
language of the "content of our
character"--to sometimes some

00:15:51.462 --> 00:15:55.583
scurrilous ends,
the roots of that are in John

00:15:55.583 --> 00:16:00.990
Campbell's arguments in the
Slaughterhouse Cases in 1873.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:05.315
Miller threw the Thirteenth
Amendment argument back at

00:16:05.315 --> 00:16:07.519
Thompson [ph?]
and told him,

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:11.110
in effect, to--well--stick it
somewhere.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.888
Now, however,
back to Miller's opinion,

00:16:13.888 --> 00:16:17.472
in a five-to-four case,
the real importance of the

00:16:17.472 --> 00:16:21.932
Slaughterhouse Case is that even
though Miller argued that the

00:16:21.932 --> 00:16:26.613
purpose of these amendments were
to advance black freedom and the

00:16:26.613 --> 00:16:31.445
rights of the freedman,
he nevertheless made a clear

00:16:31.445 --> 00:16:36.210
distinction between national and
state citizenship.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.914
In these years we don't even
think of--well,

00:16:38.914 --> 00:16:42.814
I don't think we think in terms
today of our state citizen-- do

00:16:42.814 --> 00:16:45.896
you think of yourself as a
citizen of the State of

00:16:45.896 --> 00:16:48.129
Virginia?
Maybe you do, I don't know.

00:16:48.129 --> 00:16:50.789
Maybe today in Pennsylvania,
where people are voting in

00:16:50.789 --> 00:16:53.104
droves, they're thinking of
their citizenship as

00:16:53.104 --> 00:16:54.679
Pennsylvanian,
I don't know.

00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:57.772
But we tend to think in terms
of citizenship now,

00:16:57.772 --> 00:17:00.541
certainly in the early
twenty-first century,

00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:05.520
as a national phenomenon.
One has Portuguese or German or

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.538
American or whatever,
Brazilian, citizenship and in

00:17:10.538 --> 00:17:15.141
some countries dual and so on.
Rarely do we think of ourselves

00:17:15.141 --> 00:17:18.015
as citizens of states.
But they did in the nineteenth

00:17:18.015 --> 00:17:20.116
century.
Now what Miller did in this

00:17:20.116 --> 00:17:22.829
decision though was a bit weird,
in retrospect.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.343
He named various national
privileges and

00:17:25.343 --> 00:17:28.436
immunities--that's the language
of the Fourteenth

00:17:28.436 --> 00:17:31.529
Amendment--like entering the
nation's ports,

00:17:31.529 --> 00:17:35.366
or protection out on the high
seas, the ability to run for

00:17:35.366 --> 00:17:38.260
federal office,
and to travel to the seat of

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.269
government,
and so on.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:43.863
But he never mentioned basic
civil rights,

00:17:43.863 --> 00:17:46.837
access to public facilities,
etcetera, etcetera,

00:17:46.837 --> 00:17:49.938
etcetera.
He never mentioned the right to

00:17:49.938 --> 00:17:54.668
vote.
He said all of those rights are

00:17:54.668 --> 00:18:02.553
only under the jurisdiction of
the state, not the national

00:18:02.553 --> 00:18:05.758
government.
In other words,

00:18:05.758 --> 00:18:10.241
traditional federalism,
this separation of what states

00:18:10.241 --> 00:18:13.540
can control--like the right to
vote;

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.720
like what is a civil right;
which civil rights;

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:23.719
what kinds of equality are to
be adjudicated in court--would

00:18:23.719 --> 00:18:28.454
be left to the states.
Slaughterhouse set in motion

00:18:28.454 --> 00:18:33.126
then this federal retreat,
at least in the courts--and the

00:18:33.126 --> 00:18:37.798
retreat is already happening
elsewhere-- from Miller's own

00:18:37.798 --> 00:18:41.425
definition,
ironically, of the meaning of

00:18:41.425 --> 00:18:44.779
the Thirteenth and Fourteenth
Amendments.

00:18:44.779 --> 00:18:52.089
Back to Colfax,
Louisiana, April 14,1873.

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:57.423
I don't have time for all the
gruesome details of this

00:18:57.423 --> 00:19:01.650
massacre, and I'll spare you
most of it.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:06.339
But it is in some ways an
American My Lai Massacre,

00:19:06.339 --> 00:19:11.498
a Katyn Forest Massacre--what
the Soviets did in 1944 in

00:19:11.498 --> 00:19:14.556
Poland.
One of these authors of this

00:19:14.556 --> 00:19:17.380
new book, I think a bit
inappropriately,

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:21.216
uses the term genocide,
that it was a result of a wish

00:19:21.216 --> 00:19:25.733
for genocide.
It is mass murder by any

00:19:25.733 --> 00:19:29.086
definition.
What happened is that with

00:19:29.086 --> 00:19:33.118
these two competing governments
in Louisiana--Democrat Fusion

00:19:33.118 --> 00:19:37.082
government and the Republican
government--both would appoint

00:19:37.082 --> 00:19:40.603
sheriffs in the same parish.
So there was the Republican

00:19:40.603 --> 00:19:43.065
sheriff, who was black,
and there was the Democratic

00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:46.742
sheriff, who was white.
Local officials of all kinds

00:19:46.742 --> 00:19:50.911
are being appointed.
Well what happened is that the

00:19:50.911 --> 00:19:55.380
violence in the countryside got
so bad, in Grant Parish,

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.007
that the blacks in the area
began leaving their cabins and

00:19:59.007 --> 00:20:02.570
leaving their small farms,
and they came into Colfax,

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.542
because Colfax had become a
symbol of protection and safety

00:20:06.542 --> 00:20:10.102
for blacks in the great Red
River District of Central

00:20:10.102 --> 00:20:12.904
Louisiana.
By the way, the Red River

00:20:12.904 --> 00:20:17.304
Region of Central Louisiana was
some of the richest soil in all

00:20:17.304 --> 00:20:20.749
of the South.
It was a tremendous sugar and

00:20:20.749 --> 00:20:25.164
cotton plantation region.
Several thousand acres of that

00:20:25.164 --> 00:20:28.212
Red River District,
right around Colfax,

00:20:28.212 --> 00:20:32.198
was owned by a white landowner
named Willie Calhoun,

00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:35.648
William Calhoun.
He was the son of Meredith

00:20:35.648 --> 00:20:38.778
Calhoun, who had been a very,
very proslavery,

00:20:38.778 --> 00:20:41.630
huge slaveholder before the
Civil War.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.638
But his son Willie,
who had been raised in part in

00:20:44.638 --> 00:20:48.630
Europe, because his parents kept
living half the time in Paris,

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:52.440
as a kid was badly,
terribly injured.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.166
His back was broken.
He spent his life as a

00:20:55.166 --> 00:20:58.691
hunchback.
And God only knows how he came

00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:03.602
by his sympathies and his
beliefs in the rights of former

00:21:03.602 --> 00:21:06.175
slaves,
but he became a Unionist during

00:21:06.175 --> 00:21:09.182
the Civil War in an area
where--it was not healthy to be

00:21:09.182 --> 00:21:11.369
a Unionist in the Red River
District.

00:21:11.369 --> 00:21:15.089
And after the war was over,
Willie Calhoun became an

00:21:15.089 --> 00:21:18.079
early-and-often scalawag,
a Republican.

00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:21.716
And he, in effect,
turned over much of his land,

00:21:21.716 --> 00:21:25.816
without even selling it,
to the settlement of hundreds

00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:29.529
and hundreds of freedmen and
their families.

00:21:29.529 --> 00:21:34.823
Willie Calhoun would spend the
Colfax Massacre watching

00:21:34.823 --> 00:21:39.332
probably 150-odd blacks murdered
in cold blood,

00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:43.940
as a kind of a prisoner on his
front porch.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.493
But at any rate,
blacks gathered in Colfax for

00:21:47.493 --> 00:21:52.503
weeks before the spring of '73,
because it was--it had been,

00:21:52.503 --> 00:21:56.710
at least, the Calhoun Landing,
as it was called,

00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.342
had been a place of safety.
Blacks took over the courthouse

00:22:00.342 --> 00:22:02.430
in Colfax.
They occupied it.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.309
They collected lots of weapons.
They were ready.

00:22:06.309 --> 00:22:09.700
They built trenches all the way
around the courthouse.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:15.142
They were ready for battle.
And it is battle they got from

00:22:15.142 --> 00:22:19.470
a huge mob of disparate,
paramilitary whites,

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.305
many of whom were former
Confederate soldiers,

00:22:22.305 --> 00:22:25.769
many of whom were former
members of the Ku Klux Klan;

00:22:25.769 --> 00:22:28.511
some now called themselves
Knights of the White

00:22:28.511 --> 00:22:31.730
Camellia--they went by all kinds
of different names.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:35.407
And what happened on April
14^(th) was indeed,

00:22:35.407 --> 00:22:41.495
in effect, a pitched battle.
The whites had a cannon,

00:22:41.495 --> 00:22:45.702
lots of weapons.
Blacks couldn't hold them off,

00:22:45.702 --> 00:22:49.191
they fled into the courthouse.
The whites captured a black man

00:22:49.191 --> 00:22:51.749
and forced him to take a torch
and they said,

00:22:51.749 --> 00:22:55.120
"We'll kill you or you take the
torch and light the roof on

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.596
fire."
He lit the roof on fire and the

00:22:57.596 --> 00:23:00.500
courthouse began to burn down,
which, of course,

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.310
smoked most of the blacks out
of the courthouse,

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.240
although a few stayed and were
burned to death,

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:11.862
hiding under the floorboards.
And as they came out many of

00:23:11.862 --> 00:23:15.269
them were executed right around
the door.

00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:20.925
Before the thing was over that
night, the estimate runs from

00:23:20.925 --> 00:23:25.813
about eighty to possibly as
high--we'll never really

00:23:25.813 --> 00:23:30.989
know--as 150 blacks were
killed--most of them execution

00:23:30.989 --> 00:23:34.019
style;
most of them with shots to the

00:23:34.019 --> 00:23:37.339
head, many of them shots to the
back of their heads,

00:23:37.339 --> 00:23:41.617
and many of them,
in the wake of being shot,

00:23:41.617 --> 00:23:46.626
having their bodies mutilated.
The First Representatives of

00:23:46.626 --> 00:23:50.606
the Louisiana State Government,
the Republican Louisiana State

00:23:50.606 --> 00:23:53.867
Government,
arrived forty-eight hours after

00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:57.880
the massacre and recorded,
one after another corpse,

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.848
shot in the back of the head
and then shot many more times,

00:24:02.848 --> 00:24:07.314
and then somebody's mutilated,
and they kept this--this is

00:24:07.314 --> 00:24:10.827
this kind of gruesome need to
describe you find in these

00:24:10.827 --> 00:24:14.665
reports.
They also described many of the

00:24:14.665 --> 00:24:19.519
bodies being eaten by dogs and
turkey vultures.

00:24:19.519 --> 00:24:25.829
Well, Colfax led to a national
sensation.

00:24:25.829 --> 00:24:29.528
Harper's Weekly and
Leslie's Weekly had

00:24:29.528 --> 00:24:32.799
illustrated articles about it
within a week,

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:37.132
the famous pictures of blacks
carrying their dead home to bury

00:24:37.132 --> 00:24:39.191
them;
quotations from women

00:24:39.191 --> 00:24:43.652
describing--a woman describing
dragging her son away from the

00:24:43.652 --> 00:24:47.890
dogs who were eating his body,
and so on and so forth.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.494
And it led to a national
investigation,

00:24:50.494 --> 00:24:54.265
a federal investigation,
led by the Republican appointed

00:24:54.265 --> 00:24:56.184
U.S.
Attorney in New Orleans,

00:24:56.184 --> 00:25:00.640
whose name was James Beckwith,
a northern-born New England,

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.208
old abolitionist fellow with a
good deal of zeal who heroically

00:25:06.208 --> 00:25:10.339
tried to bring indictments and
prosecutions.

00:25:10.339 --> 00:25:14.609
There were indeed many
indictments but only three

00:25:14.609 --> 00:25:17.900
convictions, in the wake of
Colfax.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:24.802
It took over two years and it
led to the second great Supreme

00:25:24.802 --> 00:25:30.210
Court case that turned around
Reconstruction.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:36.320
That case, first argued in
Louisiana, was for the three men

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.849
convicted of leading the Colfax
Massacre.

00:25:40.849 --> 00:25:44.629
One of the names was a man
named William Cruikshank,

00:25:44.629 --> 00:25:48.223
c-r-u-i-k-s-h-a-n-k;
I don't think I put it on the

00:25:48.223 --> 00:25:52.950
outline, or did I?
I guess I didn't, sorry.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:57.233
In the United States versus
Cruikshank, the U.S.

00:25:57.233 --> 00:26:02.064
Supreme Court took up the case
of these convictions in

00:26:02.064 --> 00:26:05.698
Louisiana.
The court by this time,

00:26:05.698 --> 00:26:10.311
early 1876 when the Cruikshank
case came down,

00:26:10.311 --> 00:26:15.000
had a new chief justice.
His name was Morrison Remick

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.155
Waite, w-a-i-t-e,
who'd been appointed by Grant

00:26:18.155 --> 00:26:21.516
in 1874 to replace the recently
deceased Salmon P.

00:26:21.516 --> 00:26:25.151
Chase, who had been appointed
Chief Justice by Abraham

00:26:25.151 --> 00:26:28.130
Lincoln.
The court by 1876 was seven

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:31.963
Republicans and two Democrats.
Most of them now had been

00:26:31.963 --> 00:26:35.291
appointed by Lincoln or Grant.
This was a thoroughly

00:26:35.291 --> 00:26:37.350
Republican Party Supreme Court.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:46.273
Waite by the way--we've been
through many Supreme Court

00:26:46.273 --> 00:26:49.776
appointments in our recent
lifetime and we know how

00:26:49.776 --> 00:26:53.559
political these things can
get--Waite was Grant's fifth

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:56.676
choice.
The first two people he asked

00:26:56.676 --> 00:26:59.106
turned him down.
I don't want to be on the

00:26:59.106 --> 00:27:00.970
Supreme Court,
there's no political future

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.878
there.
Supreme Court justices in these

00:27:02.878 --> 00:27:05.779
years often ran for President
while they were on the court,

00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:10.214
and it's--they don't do that,
at least they don't do that

00:27:10.214 --> 00:27:11.939
now.
The next two people he

00:27:11.939 --> 00:27:15.232
appointed, or he wanted to
appoint, were turned down by the

00:27:15.232 --> 00:27:16.790
Senate.
Waite was his fifth choice.

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.271
Nobody had ever heard of him.
He was known in Ohio,

00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:25.595
but as one of his own Supreme
Court colleagues called him,

00:27:25.595 --> 00:27:29.611
said Waite was,
quote, "at the front rank of

00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:34.150
second rank lawyers."
And maybe it proved the old

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.200
adage-- apologies to anyone from
Ohio;

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.561
you know the old saying;
Ohio's had more presidents I

00:27:41.561 --> 00:27:46.245
think even than Virginia-- some
are born great,

00:27:46.245 --> 00:27:51.539
some achieve greatness,
some just come from Ohio.

00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:57.001
Morrison Waite will write the
opinion, in a nine-to-nothing

00:27:57.001 --> 00:28:02.180
decision, unanimous decision,
in the Cruikshank case.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.583
This was a test,
this case now,

00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:08.349
of really the Enforcement Act
passed in 1870,

00:28:08.349 --> 00:28:12.941
the Enforcement Act as part of
the Ku Klux Klan Acts,

00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:17.710
authorizing the federal
government to enforce the right

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:21.391
to vote,
with military action if

00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:26.260
necessary, in the South.
This was a case now testing

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.795
that;
also, of course,

00:28:27.795 --> 00:28:31.119
testing the Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments.

00:28:31.119 --> 00:28:35.066
The court decision in
Cruikshank found the

00:28:35.066 --> 00:28:38.049
indictments, it said,
faulty.

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:41.599
It overturned two of the three
convictions.

00:28:41.599 --> 00:28:46.567
It ruled that those immortal
phrases of 'due process' and

00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:50.906
'equal protection,'
those two great clauses in part

00:28:50.906 --> 00:28:55.140
one of the Fourteenth Amendment,
applied, they said,

00:28:55.140 --> 00:29:01.065
only to state actions,
and not to the actions of

00:29:01.065 --> 00:29:06.513
individuals.
If a man murders another man in

00:29:06.513 --> 00:29:12.335
Colfax, Louisiana,
in a political way or any other

00:29:12.335 --> 00:29:18.595
way, that's a state matter.
Even if it's around voting it's

00:29:18.595 --> 00:29:21.900
a state matter,
not a federal matter;

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.460
can't be adjudicated in the
federal court.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.985
Federal government does not
have the power to enforce the

00:29:28.985 --> 00:29:32.218
right to vote,
the right to civil rights,

00:29:32.218 --> 00:29:34.919
and so on.
The Cruikshank case--the

00:29:34.919 --> 00:29:39.039
implications of the Cruikshank
case--immediately were obvious.

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:42.123
It meant, number one,
that mass murder went

00:29:42.123 --> 00:29:46.551
unpunished in the United States.
Two, it meant that blacks

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:51.031
increasingly now would be at the
mercy of now hostile state

00:29:51.031 --> 00:29:53.987
governments.
Back when Justice Miller wrote

00:29:53.987 --> 00:29:57.402
that decision in Slaughterhouse,
there were still a lot of

00:29:57.402 --> 00:30:00.853
Republican Regimes.
And he claimed to his dying day

00:30:00.853 --> 00:30:04.638
he was leaving adjudication to
states, under sympathetic

00:30:04.638 --> 00:30:08.470
Republic governments.
Yeah, but Justice Miller,

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:12.308
what if a government's no
longer sympathetic,

00:30:12.308 --> 00:30:16.371
what if it's run by Klansmen?
And three, it opened

00:30:16.371 --> 00:30:20.059
up--Cruikshank now opens up--as
a federal court decision,

00:30:20.059 --> 00:30:25.132
all manner of discriminatory
laws passed by what will be

00:30:25.132 --> 00:30:30.390
Democratic Redeemer governments
in the Southern states.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.967
Why was there a nine-to-nothing
decision in 1876 on this,

00:30:33.967 --> 00:30:37.545
with seven of the justices
appointed by Lincoln and Grant

00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:40.477
and so on?
Well, one, you have to realize

00:30:40.477 --> 00:30:43.192
that by '75 and '76,
when these guys were

00:30:43.192 --> 00:30:47.202
adjudicating this decision,
there was a tremendous amount

00:30:47.202 --> 00:30:50.329
of just flat-out fatigue with
Reconstruction.

00:30:50.329 --> 00:30:54.293
And I've been to all--I've been
to a lot of your sections now

00:30:54.293 --> 00:30:58.257
and I've heard you say the same
thing, and I'm not chastising

00:30:58.257 --> 00:31:01.655
you, I'm not.
But sometimes we read back into

00:31:01.655 --> 00:31:05.400
the past even our own fatigue
with certain issues.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.630
They were sort of fed-up with
Reconstruction in the North.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:14.750
Well yeah, they were,
but look at the consequences.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:18.856
It's clear, even in their own
writings, that many of the

00:31:18.856 --> 00:31:23.410
justices just wanted to get rid
of Reconstruction and leave it

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:25.480
to the South.
It signaled now,

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.180
most importantly--and Foner
makes this point in the one

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.380
little paragraph he gives you on
the Cruikshank case--it signaled

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.430
now that the federal government
was,

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.890
in effect, exiting
Reconstruction;

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:41.565
certainly the Supreme Court was.
And as Foner says,

00:31:41.565 --> 00:31:48.713
terror was given a green light
anywhere that a state government

00:31:48.713 --> 00:31:54.940
was unwilling to enforce the law
or protect people.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.706
Now, why was Radicalism waning
in the 1870s,

00:31:58.706 --> 00:32:02.210
or even at the beginning of the
1870s?

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:05.323
What is it about the Grant
years, especially the second

00:32:05.323 --> 00:32:08.283
Grant Administration,
that leads--that just

00:32:08.283 --> 00:32:12.640
practically paves these roads to
a Southern redemption,

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.264
a Southern counter-revolution?
Well there are many factors,

00:32:17.264 --> 00:32:20.336
and let me kind of run through
them and then focus especially

00:32:20.336 --> 00:32:22.385
on the scandals,
for a moment,

00:32:22.385 --> 00:32:26.190
and then on this larger
question of violence;

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:30.109
in case you haven't heard
enough about violence.

00:32:30.109 --> 00:32:36.051
First of all there's the Panic
of 1873, which hit in the spring

00:32:36.051 --> 00:32:39.101
of 1873.
A major economic depression had

00:32:39.101 --> 00:32:43.149
hit the country--eventually the
entire country--that led to a

00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:46.049
great deal of labor strife and
violence.

00:32:46.049 --> 00:32:49.461
It meant in the wake of
the--well, in the midst of the

00:32:49.461 --> 00:32:51.069
Panic of '73,
into '74,

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:55.313
'75, that the issues now that
politicians were most concerned

00:32:55.313 --> 00:32:58.920
about, and that voters were most
concerned about,

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.539
particularly in the North,
were things like currency,

00:33:02.539 --> 00:33:05.397
tariffs, unemployment,
railroad subsidies,

00:33:05.397 --> 00:33:08.022
labor strife,
whether a union had the right

00:33:08.022 --> 00:33:10.960
to strike here or the right to
strike there.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.345
And across the great Midwest,
among farmers,

00:33:13.345 --> 00:33:15.730
the biggest issue was the price
of wheat,

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:21.606
which dropped from two dollars
a barrel to fifty cents in a

00:33:21.606 --> 00:33:25.252
year and a half.
Wages for manufacturing

00:33:25.252 --> 00:33:29.294
laborers in the United States,
in a year and a half,

00:33:29.294 --> 00:33:33.019
dropped by fifty percent across
the country;

00:33:33.019 --> 00:33:36.630
that's for those who kept their
jobs.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:43.877
The Panic of 1873 shifted
people's minds,

00:33:43.877 --> 00:33:49.596
to say the least.
Then there's the factor of--the

00:33:49.596 --> 00:33:54.006
nature of Grant's presidency;
the way in which Grant himself

00:33:54.006 --> 00:33:57.628
even defined the presidency.
Grant, you'll remember,

00:33:57.628 --> 00:34:00.539
was a rather reluctant
politician, at first.

00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:04.404
He actually got a little better
at it than his historical

00:34:04.404 --> 00:34:07.510
reputation has sometimes led us
to believe.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:11.319
Grant could be very political.
Although he did have this idea

00:34:11.319 --> 00:34:14.739
that the presidency ought to
be--especially in these crisis

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:17.104
years,
with the tremendous bitterness,

00:34:17.104 --> 00:34:19.650
bloody shirt tensions after the
Civil War;

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.273
and after all,
he's the general that won the

00:34:22.273 --> 00:34:25.141
war and obliterated
Virginia--that the president

00:34:25.141 --> 00:34:28.010
ought to be now just basically a
caretaker,

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.420
ought to have as few opinions
as possible;

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:38.272
a caretaker presidency,
not so much a leader as a

00:34:38.272 --> 00:34:42.072
unifier.
Now his hands-off approach to

00:34:42.072 --> 00:34:44.854
so many things,
of course, is what,

00:34:44.854 --> 00:34:48.944
in part, led to the scandals
that have so long been

00:34:48.944 --> 00:34:52.190
associated with him,
or at least with his

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:55.584
administration.
I would argue that Grant has

00:34:55.584 --> 00:34:59.322
gotten, to some extent,
a bad rap, from some

00:34:59.322 --> 00:35:02.143
historians,
although if you look at any of

00:35:02.143 --> 00:35:04.975
those lists that come out every
year, when they survey

00:35:04.975 --> 00:35:07.059
historians--the greatest
presidents,

00:35:07.059 --> 00:35:10.823
the worst presidents--Lincoln's
always at the top and then you

00:35:10.823 --> 00:35:13.881
get FDR;
now Reagan is always in the top

00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:17.739
three, for reasons I don't even
want to discuss.

00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:21.419
[Laughter]
Well, a lot of airports are

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:25.000
named for him,
I guess that's why.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.280
At any rate, enough on that.
Grant has always been down near

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.219
the bottom.
I can't resist this.

00:35:34.219 --> 00:35:37.394
The great American cynic of the
nineteenth century,

00:35:37.394 --> 00:35:41.140
one of our greatest historians
and one of our most beautiful

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.869
writers--but what a cynic--Henry
Adams,

00:35:43.869 --> 00:35:47.361
son of Charles Francis Adams,
grandson of Quincy,

00:35:47.361 --> 00:35:52.125
great-grandson of John.
This was his description of

00:35:52.125 --> 00:35:57.470
Grant, and he was living the
Grant Administration:

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:01.938
"Grant had no right to exist."
[Laughter]

00:36:01.938 --> 00:36:05.150
"He should've been extinct for
ages.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:09.075
That 2000 years after Alexander
the Great and Julius Caesar,

00:36:09.075 --> 00:36:12.801
a man like Grant should be
called and should actually and

00:36:12.801 --> 00:36:17.060
truly be the highest product of
the most advanced evolution,

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:22.522
made evolution ludicrous.
The progress of evolution,

00:36:22.522 --> 00:36:26.520
from President Washington to
President Grant,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.610
was alone evidence enough to
upset Darwin.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:36.160
Grant should've lived in a cave
and worn skins."

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.324
Oh.
[Laughter]

00:36:40.324 --> 00:36:44.809
That's cold,
and unfair.

00:36:44.809 --> 00:36:49.231
But under his leadership a
whole series of four or five

00:36:49.231 --> 00:36:53.817
different scandals that sort of
set the standard [laughs]

00:36:53.817 --> 00:36:57.420
for scandal to come in American
history;

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.050
although we've had some much
worse ones since than some of

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.217
these.
Most of them were of course

00:37:02.217 --> 00:37:05.291
financial.
There's almost no sex in the

00:37:05.291 --> 00:37:08.970
Grant scandal years,
so far as we can tell.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:13.778
The first was the Gold Scandal.
This was an attempt to corner

00:37:13.778 --> 00:37:17.409
the gold market by one Jay Gould
and James Fisk.

00:37:17.409 --> 00:37:19.289
These were Wall Street guys in
New York.

00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:22.949
This is in 1869,
right after Grant took office.

00:37:22.949 --> 00:37:25.579
They did indeed corner the
market on gold.

00:37:25.579 --> 00:37:29.215
They tried to buy up all the
gold in New York,

00:37:29.215 --> 00:37:34.061
and then they planned to force
bankers and business people to

00:37:34.061 --> 00:37:38.342
buy the gold from them at
inflated prices--it's an old

00:37:38.342 --> 00:37:42.355
cornering trick.
They made eleven million

00:37:42.355 --> 00:37:48.130
dollars in three weeks doing
this, in the nineteenth century.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:54.230
They were eventually selling
that gold at $163.50 per ounce.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.999
And the only way to break their
corner was--suddenly,

00:37:56.999 --> 00:37:59.503
because it happened so
fast--was for the Federal

00:37:59.503 --> 00:38:02.059
Government to begin selling all
of its gold,

00:38:02.059 --> 00:38:05.920
put it on the market,
get the prices down.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:11.496
Grant's brother-in-law--never
appoint your brother-in-law to

00:38:11.496 --> 00:38:16.789
anything--Abel Corbin was a sort
of personal emissary.

00:38:16.789 --> 00:38:21.021
He assured and promised the
plotters, Gould and Fisk,

00:38:21.021 --> 00:38:25.579
that he had influence on Grant
and that Grant would never

00:38:25.579 --> 00:38:29.159
permit the government's gold to
be sold.

00:38:29.159 --> 00:38:33.630
But he was wrong and Grant did
allow it to be sold.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:38.892
And then Grant's treasury
secretary, George Boutwell,

00:38:38.892 --> 00:38:42.507
got involved.
The scandal finally broke open

00:38:42.507 --> 00:38:45.514
in the press,
and though nothing ever really

00:38:45.514 --> 00:38:48.661
happened to Gould or
Fisk--setting in motion a

00:38:48.661 --> 00:38:52.787
history of who gets caught and
who doesn't get caught in the

00:38:52.787 --> 00:38:56.913
Wall Street world--it was the
first scandal of its kind that

00:38:56.913 --> 00:39:00.829
began to lead to cries of civil
service reform,

00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:06.920
which became a big rallying cry
in the 1870s.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:12.550
Then there was the Whiskey Ring.
Man, this was old-fashioned,

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:18.330
just unadulterated fraud.
This began in the early 1870s.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.182
It first started in St. Louis.
It was really a cartel,

00:39:22.182 --> 00:39:26.219
what we in modern times would
call the creation of a cartel.

00:39:26.219 --> 00:39:29.280
These were whiskey distillers,
all over the country,

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.440
who banded together to cheat
the U.S.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.510
Government out of excise taxes;
the luxury tax on whiskey.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:40.428
The way that they did it is
many distillers were forced to

00:39:40.428 --> 00:39:44.277
join this ring of people around
the country or have their

00:39:44.277 --> 00:39:48.243
businesses ruined;
join or we'll run you out of

00:39:48.243 --> 00:39:50.490
business.
The Whiskey Ring had branch

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:53.382
offices all over the country,
in cities like Milwaukee and

00:39:53.382 --> 00:39:54.520
Peoria,
New Orleans,

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.307
Chicago, Cincinnati,
in Washington,

00:39:56.307 --> 00:39:57.990
and many other cities,
North,

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.686
South, West, you name it.
And then they started bribing

00:40:01.686 --> 00:40:04.243
the Treasury Department,
which of course is where the

00:40:04.243 --> 00:40:07.944
excise taxes would go to.
Many officials in the Treasury

00:40:07.944 --> 00:40:12.206
Department were soon on the
payroll of the Whiskey Ring,

00:40:12.206 --> 00:40:15.073
especially the chief clerk of
the U.S.

00:40:15.073 --> 00:40:19.179
Treasury Department,
the man who kept the books.

00:40:19.179 --> 00:40:22.808
One General Orville Babcock,
the president's private

00:40:22.808 --> 00:40:26.181
secretary, was implicated;
more than implicated,

00:40:26.181 --> 00:40:29.764
he was involved.
He was charged eventually,

00:40:29.764 --> 00:40:33.201
although acquitted.
Grant entered a deposition on

00:40:33.201 --> 00:40:35.487
his behalf and his good
character and so on,

00:40:35.487 --> 00:40:37.880
in court--which he never should
have done.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.287
He didn't really look at the
facts, he didn't look at the

00:40:40.287 --> 00:40:42.843
evidence.
The point of all this one is

00:40:42.843 --> 00:40:47.309
that millions and millions of
dollars in liquor revenues were

00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:50.732
lost to the U.S.
Government, from about 1870 to

00:40:50.732 --> 00:40:55.197
1875, and most of that money
went into the pockets of whiskey

00:40:55.197 --> 00:40:59.588
distillers and a lot of it went
into the pockets of Treasury

00:40:59.588 --> 00:41:03.607
Department officials who were
themselves supposed to be

00:41:03.607 --> 00:41:08.371
collecting the tax.
The estimate is that between

00:41:08.371 --> 00:41:13.885
forty and fifty million dollars
was grafted in this particular

00:41:13.885 --> 00:41:17.150
scandal.
The scandal broke in 1875.

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:21.201
There were about 150 people
indicted in the liquor business,

00:41:21.201 --> 00:41:24.429
about eighty-five people
indicted in the federal

00:41:24.429 --> 00:41:28.101
government.
There were 110 convictions,

00:41:28.101 --> 00:41:33.190
although nobody served terribly
long in any prison.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:36.102
And thirdly,
there's this thing called

00:41:36.102 --> 00:41:40.537
CrÃ©dit Mobilier.
This was the company that was

00:41:40.537 --> 00:41:45.727
first chartered in 1859 as part
of--it was the finance company

00:41:45.727 --> 00:41:49.593
for the Pennsylvania,
it was called the Pennsylvania

00:41:49.593 --> 00:41:52.936
Fiscal Agency originally,
it was the finance company for

00:41:52.936 --> 00:41:56.746
the Union Pacific Railroad,
that got the greatest contract

00:41:56.746 --> 00:42:00.719
in American history to build the
Transcontinental Railroad.

00:42:00.719 --> 00:42:04.406
The Union Pacific had a charter
from the federal government to

00:42:04.406 --> 00:42:07.972
build this great railroad to the
Pacific, or possibly two or

00:42:07.972 --> 00:42:10.923
three of them.
For each mile of track built

00:42:10.923 --> 00:42:15.050
the Union Pacific was to receive
ten sections of public land,

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:20.011
and from 16,000 to 48,000
dollars, depending on how

00:42:20.011 --> 00:42:23.980
difficult the terrain was to
build on.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:28.096
The Union Pacific arranged the
construction contracts with its

00:42:28.096 --> 00:42:31.469
own firm, that it called
CrÃ©dit Mobilier,

00:42:31.469 --> 00:42:35.889
so that all government money
would get spent.

00:42:35.889 --> 00:42:37.871
You know the old routine,
if you get a grant,

00:42:37.871 --> 00:42:40.664
make sure you spend it because
they won't give you as much next

00:42:40.664 --> 00:42:42.689
time.
CrÃ©dit Mobilier,

00:42:42.689 --> 00:42:46.349
and therefore Union Pacific,
made enormous profits.

00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:49.688
The shares of stock in
CrÃ©dit Mobilier

00:42:49.688 --> 00:42:54.090
skyrocketed, and to keep the
federal government in line and

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:59.292
to let this continue to go on,
many congressmen--we'll never

00:42:59.292 --> 00:43:04.445
know exactly how many--were on
the take, were simply being

00:43:04.445 --> 00:43:08.699
bribed,
in old-fashioned handfuls of

00:43:08.699 --> 00:43:15.809
cash, by the Union Pacific.
This scandal too broke in 1873.

00:43:15.809 --> 00:43:18.514
All kinds of people were
accused, including

00:43:18.514 --> 00:43:23.044
Vice-President Schuyler Colfax.
Congress reprimanded one

00:43:23.044 --> 00:43:27.553
government railroad agent and
two congressmen,

00:43:27.553 --> 00:43:31.999
and then just left it alone.
So far as I know,

00:43:31.999 --> 00:43:36.570
no one's ever really put a
price tag on the graft committed

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:41.219
by the Union Pacific in the
CrÃ©dit Mobilier case.

00:43:41.219 --> 00:43:48.327
This kind of spoils-men
financial corruption became

00:43:48.327 --> 00:43:54.481
rampant in the Grant years,
and again a huge political

00:43:54.481 --> 00:43:57.996
distraction away from the issues
of the South,

00:43:57.996 --> 00:44:04.070
the issues of the freedmen,
the issues of Reconstruction.

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:09.360
The other major path to
Southern redemption,

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:15.511
the success of the white
Southern Democratic Party,

00:44:15.511 --> 00:44:20.309
was of course the uses of
violence.

00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:24.100
But before I give you a little
more litany on the level of Klan

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.768
terrorism, think with me for
just a moment what those Radical

00:44:27.768 --> 00:44:31.558
Republicans originally--almost
none of whom are really in power

00:44:31.558 --> 00:44:34.310
anymore: Thaddeus Stevens died
in 1869;

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:38.730
Charles Sumner dies in 1874;
Benjamin Wade is long gone,

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:42.021
as a senator from Ohio.
The old leadership of the

00:44:42.021 --> 00:44:44.173
Radicals is really no longer
there by 1874,

00:44:44.173 --> 00:44:47.401
when the Democrats are going to
throw the Republicans out of the

00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:49.400
leadership of the Congress
anyway.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:54.134
But think with me for just a
moment, back to what Foner

00:44:54.134 --> 00:44:57.289
called the Radicals' civic
vision.

00:44:57.289 --> 00:45:02.392
That civic vision again was
rooted in Free Soilism,

00:45:02.392 --> 00:45:06.872
Unionism, winning the war,
and ending slavery,

00:45:06.872 --> 00:45:10.032
emancipation,
and then to at least the

00:45:10.032 --> 00:45:14.405
beginnings of racial equality.
You cannot mistake that they

00:45:14.405 --> 00:45:17.127
believed in at least the
beginnings of that in the

00:45:17.127 --> 00:45:19.960
Thirteenth, Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:25.564
But think for a moment,
in the nineteenth century how

00:45:25.564 --> 00:45:31.599
would most Americans think about
the idea of equality?

00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:35.851
I would argue that in our
history, this nation in the

00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:40.757
modern world that probably tried
to do more about the idea of

00:45:40.757 --> 00:45:44.110
equality than perhaps any place
else,

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:48.329
has gone through three
definitions of equality.

00:45:48.329 --> 00:45:53.661
The first we might simply call
equality in the eyes of God,

00:45:53.661 --> 00:45:57.173
or natural rights.
The old Enlightenment--it's not

00:45:57.173 --> 00:46:00.360
just from the Enlightenment,
it's in the Epistles of Paul,

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.899
it's ancient in some ways--but
the idea that somehow you're

00:46:04.899 --> 00:46:09.224
born equal before God or nature,
that you have a natural

00:46:09.224 --> 00:46:12.293
capacity that's equal.
It doesn't say anything about

00:46:12.293 --> 00:46:15.907
human affairs.
It doesn't say anything about

00:46:15.907 --> 00:46:20.999
government or law.
The second kind of equality

00:46:20.999 --> 00:46:26.570
that came into history is
equality before law.

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:30.063
That was never codified,
never spoken,

00:46:30.063 --> 00:46:38.070
until the Fourteenth Amendment;
the equal protection of the law.

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:41.889
That's where it begins.
If there's a third kind of

00:46:41.889 --> 00:46:45.880
equality in our history it's
probably what we came to call,

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.749
in the twentieth century,
and especially in the Civil

00:46:48.749 --> 00:46:55.389
Rights Revolution and its wake,
an equality of opportunity.

00:46:55.389 --> 00:47:00.095
In the nineteenth century
trust--they never got to that

00:47:00.095 --> 00:47:04.452
one, and they didn't get
terribly far with equality

00:47:04.452 --> 00:47:07.667
before law.
The Radical Republicans' ideas

00:47:07.667 --> 00:47:11.101
were up against--and here you
can just give up and say,

00:47:11.101 --> 00:47:13.899
"well you see,
what--they tried to go too far

00:47:13.899 --> 00:47:16.500
too fast;
they were ahead of their times;

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.453
gee whiz, Reconstruction
failed, maybe it should've

00:47:19.453 --> 00:47:22.230
failed, can't do anything about
it, so be it;

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.619
well the lights went out for 75
or 80 years but that's-- you

00:47:25.619 --> 00:47:28.320
know, some things are inevitable
in history."

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:36.960
If you're comfortable with
that, fine.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.319
But the Radical Republican
ideology at least set in motion

00:47:41.319 --> 00:47:44.261
a tradition.
The problem was they got

00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:49.095
cornered themselves by their own
language, because the language

00:47:49.095 --> 00:47:53.929
they got cornered by was the
language of guaranteed rights.

00:47:53.929 --> 00:48:00.091
If you guaranteed somebody's
beginnings of equality in law,

00:48:00.091 --> 00:48:04.605
what else is there to do?
If you and I are equal before

00:48:04.605 --> 00:48:07.840
the law, at least the law says
we're equal before the law,

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:11.484
what else can government do?
But the Radical Republicans in

00:48:11.484 --> 00:48:14.877
Reconstruction launched that
question into our history,

00:48:14.877 --> 00:48:18.350
as no one ever had.
What do governments owe people

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:20.860
and what do people owe
governments?

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.611
The trouble,
of course, was that

00:48:23.611 --> 00:48:28.137
on-the-ground in the South,
the Klan, and all of its

00:48:28.137 --> 00:48:33.760
imitators,
were winning Reconstruction by

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:40.770
terror, by political violence,
by intimidation.

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:44.760
Now you've read about the Klan.
I've given you statistics on

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.031
Klan violence,
especially in 1868 up through

00:48:48.031 --> 00:48:49.948
1871.
But it was the first Grant

00:48:49.948 --> 00:48:53.019
Administration--and we've got to
give Grant credit for this,

00:48:53.019 --> 00:48:56.524
and Henry Adams should've at
least thought of this when he

00:48:56.524 --> 00:48:58.860
wrote that God-awful
passage--the Grant

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:03.592
Administration did act,
in 1870 and '71,

00:49:03.592 --> 00:49:08.092
against the Klan.
May 31,1870,

00:49:08.092 --> 00:49:13.131
it passed the so-called Force
Act, or the First Enforcement

00:49:13.131 --> 00:49:15.415
Act.
It made it a federal offence to

00:49:15.415 --> 00:49:18.226
interfere with any person's
right to vote and made it

00:49:18.226 --> 00:49:21.923
punishable in a federal court.
That's the very law the

00:49:21.923 --> 00:49:26.747
Cruikshank case is going to
come, along six years later and

00:49:26.747 --> 00:49:29.819
say,
"no, the federal government

00:49:29.819 --> 00:49:33.599
can't enforce that,
only the state can."

00:49:33.599 --> 00:49:37.915
It's one of those moments you
want to go back into history and

00:49:37.915 --> 00:49:40.958
just grab some people by the
collar and say,

00:49:40.958 --> 00:49:43.930
"No, no, no,
no, think one more time."

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:47.466
But, of course we can't do that.
February 28,1871,

00:49:47.466 --> 00:49:50.683
the Second Force Act,
provided a machinery for the

00:49:50.683 --> 00:49:54.097
federal supervision of
registration and voting in the

00:49:54.097 --> 00:49:57.059
South.
It had at least tried.

00:49:57.059 --> 00:50:01.910
And finally they passed what
was called the Ku Klux Klan Act;

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:07.871
April 20,1871.
It authorized the President to

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:12.714
use the Army and to suspend the
writ of habeas corpus wherever

00:50:12.714 --> 00:50:16.053
he deemed necessary,
if there was a state of

00:50:16.053 --> 00:50:19.147
insurrection--which there was in
South Carolina,

00:50:19.147 --> 00:50:22.743
in about twelve counties.
Move the Army in,

00:50:22.743 --> 00:50:26.661
if necessary,
to protect the safety and

00:50:26.661 --> 00:50:32.556
security of elections.
Now, under this authority of

00:50:32.556 --> 00:50:39.545
these Enforcement Acts and the
Klan Acts, approximately 3000

00:50:39.545 --> 00:50:42.526
people,
mostly white Southerners,

00:50:42.526 --> 00:50:45.329
were indicted for Klan
violence--murder,

00:50:45.329 --> 00:50:48.240
intimidation,
torture.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:52.949
Thousands were arrested.
Many of those 3000 indicted

00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:55.619
pleaded guilty and got suspended
sentences.

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:59.889
About 600 were convicted,
250 acquitted.

00:50:59.889 --> 00:51:03.940
Most received fines or light
jail sentences.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:08.778
Sixty-five people were
imprisoned for up to five years

00:51:08.778 --> 00:51:13.159
in a federal penitentiary in
Albany, New York.

00:51:13.159 --> 00:51:21.159
All of them were out by 1875,
before the Cruikshank Case.

00:51:21.159 --> 00:51:24.789
The thousands of people
murdered by the Klan,

00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:28.585
the thousands tortured,
the thousands kept from

00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:32.380
voting--sixty-five people were
prosecuted.

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.691
If you think back to the other
day, that quotation I asked you

00:51:35.691 --> 00:51:39.238
to keep in your head,
when Frederick Douglass gives

00:51:39.238 --> 00:51:43.041
that speech in 1875,
imagining the following year

00:51:43.041 --> 00:51:45.815
the centennial of U.S.
independence,

00:51:45.815 --> 00:51:50.490
and he worries about all the
hosannas to American patriotism

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:55.886
and to independence,
and he says "if war among the

00:51:55.886 --> 00:52:01.951
whites brought freedom to
blacks, what will peace among

00:52:01.951 --> 00:52:09.064
the whites bring?"
It is a peace among the whites

00:52:09.064 --> 00:52:13.659
that was happening,
by 1875.

00:52:13.659 --> 00:52:17.684
On Thursday we'll move this
toward one of the ends of

00:52:17.684 --> 00:52:18.750
Reconstruction.

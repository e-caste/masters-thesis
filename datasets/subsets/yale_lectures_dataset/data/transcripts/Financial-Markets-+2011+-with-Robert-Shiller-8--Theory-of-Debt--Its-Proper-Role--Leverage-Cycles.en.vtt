00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.440
We're talking about the theory
of debt and interest rates.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.850
So, I want to talk about a
number of technical topics

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.240
first. We're going to start with
a model, an Irving Fisher

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.370
model of interest. And then
I'm going to talk about

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.270
present values, and discount
bonds, compound interest,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.520
conventional bonds, the term
structure of interest rates,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.670
and forward rates.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.880
These are all technical
things.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.360
And then, I want to get back
and think about what really

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.055
goes on in debt markets.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.920
There's two assignments
for this lecture.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.610
One is several chapters out of
the Fabozzi et al. manuscript.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.500
And then, there's a chapter from
my forthcoming book that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.220
I'm currently writing, but
that is the most meager

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.890
chapter that I've
given you yet.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.140
The book is not done, so I think
the real reference for

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.880
this is the Fabozzi et al.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.380
manuscript, at this point.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.240
And then, Oliver will give a TA
section that will clarify,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.140
I think, some of the points.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.100
So anyway, what we're talking
about today is interest rates.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.200
The percent that you earn on a
loan, or that you pay on a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.120
loan, depending on what
side of it you are.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.750
And interest rates go back
thousands of years.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.346
It's an old idea.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.710
Typically, it's a few percent
a year, right?

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.050
The first question we want to
try to think about is what

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.000
explains that.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.100
Why is it a few percent
a year?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.910
And why not something completely
different?

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.915
And why is it even a
positive number?

00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:12.590
Do you ever think of negative
interest rates?

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.880
Well, these are basic
questions.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.500
So, I wanted to start with the
history of thought and an

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.120
economist from the 19th
century, Eugen von

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:37.570
Boehm-Bawerk, who wrote a book
on the theory of interest in

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.720
the late nineteen century.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.050
Actually it was 1884.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:52.140
And it's a long, very verbose
account of what causes

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.180
interest rates.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.000
But basically, he came up
with three explanations.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.990
Why is the interest rate
something like 5%, or 3%, or

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.110
7%, or something
in that range?

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.570
And he said, there's really
three causes.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.300
One of them is technical
progress.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.440
That, as the economy gets
more and more scientific

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.540
information about how to do
things, things get more

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.550
productive.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.700
So, maybe the 3% percent, or the
5%, whatever it is, is the

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.310
rate of technical progress.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.470
That's how fast technology
is improving.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.820
But that's not the only
cause that von

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.700
Boehm-Bawerk talked about.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.310
Another one was advantages
to roundaboutness.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.350
That must be some translation
from his German.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.040
But the idea is that more
roundabout production is more

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.550
productive.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.380
This isn't technical progress.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.760
If someone can ask you to make
something directly right now,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.130
you've got to use the simplest
and the most direct way to do

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.800
it, if you're going to
do it right now.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.070
But if you have time,
you can do it in a

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.910
more roundabout way.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.529
You can make tools first and do
something else that makes

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.170
you a more efficient
producer of this.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.420
And so, maybe the interest
rate is a measure of the

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.420
advantages to roundaboutness.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.540
And the third cause that von
Boehm-Bawerk gave is time

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.870
preference.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.770
That people just prefer the
present over the future.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.710
They're impatient.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.930
This is behavioral economics,
I suppose.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.520
This is psychology.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.350
That, you know, you've got a
box of candy sitting there.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.580
And you're looking at it and
you're saying, well, I should

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.040
really enjoy that next year.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.860
Well, maybe it would
spoil by next year.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.920
Next month.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.800
But somehow you don't.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.520
You have an impulse
to consume now.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.440
So, maybe the rate of interest
is the rate of time

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.690
preference.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.330
Why is the interest rate 5%?

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.110
It's because people are 5%
happier to get something now

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.230
than to get it in the future.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.190
So, he left that train
of thought for us.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.010
This was not Mathematical
Economics.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.000
It was Literary Economics.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.990
But the next person I want to
mention in the history of

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:34.720
thought is Irving Fisher, who
was a professor at Yale

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.890
University.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:47.970
But he wrote a book in 1930
called The Theory of Interest.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.050
And it is the all-time
classic, I

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.130
think, on this topic.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.560
So, Irving Fisher is talked
about in your textbook by

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.700
Fabozzi et al.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.060
He's talked about in
many textbooks.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.660
He graduated from Yale.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.380
I mention this, since you're
Yale undergrads.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.786
He was a Yale undergrad.

00:06:13.786 --> 00:06:18.320
He graduated, maybe
it was in 1885.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.390
And he got the first Economics
Ph.D. at Yale University in

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.190
the 1890's.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.480
And he just stayed here in
New Haven all his life.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.730
And if you were living in New
Haven in the early twentieth

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.930
century, you'd know him because
he was a jogger.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.160
Nobody else jogged.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.300
He would exercise and run around
campus, so everyone

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.700
would see him.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.930
In the 1910's or '20's,
nobody did that.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.620
But he did.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.500
He was a health nut,
among other things.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.860
I could talk a lot about him,
he's a fascinating guy.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.020
I'll tell you one more
story about him.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.100
He would invite students to
his house for dinner.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.960
And he would explain to them
before dinner that he believed

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.010
that proper eating required that
you chew every bite 100

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.960
times before you swallow it.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.310
So, he would tell his
students to do that.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.350
And it slowed down
conversation at

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.125
dinner a great deal.

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:17.710
But that's not what
he's known for.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.870
What he's known for is, among
other things, his theory of

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.130
interest. So, this is what's
talked about in your textbook

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:30.310
and I wanted to start out with
Irving Fisher because --

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.705
by the way, I don't know when
this room was built.

00:07:32.705 --> 00:07:35.350
Does anyone know?

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.450
Because he died in '47.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.560
He probably lectured from this
same blackboard, right?

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.620
So, I don't know, this same
slate, it could be, right?

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.310
It could go back to that time.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.490
So, I'm going to put back on the
board what he had on this

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:58.920
board, I'm assuming in some
time in the 1930's.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.020
What your author, your textbook
author, Fabozzi,

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.600
emphasizes for a theory of
interest is something that

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.800
came from Fisher that's
very simple.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.630
And he says, the interest
rate --

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.900
this is Fabozzi's distillation
of Irving Fisher --

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.810
the interest rate is the
intersection of a supply and

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.659
demand curve for savings.

00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:29.020
So, I'm going to put saving,
s, on this axis.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.990
And on this axis, I'm going
to put the interest

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.120
rate, call that r.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.700
I don't know why we commonly use
r for interest. It's not

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.780
the first letter, it's in
the middle of the word.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:47.110
And the idea is that there's a
supply of saving at any time.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.630
That people then wish to put in
the bank or someplace else

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.250
to earn interest. And the theory
is that the higher the

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.410
interest rate, the more people
will save. So, we have an

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.920
upward-sloping supply curve.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.520
Now this S means supply,
whereas this S

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.620
down here means saving.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:13.600
And then there's a demand for
investment capital, right?

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.400
The bank lends out your savings
to businesses, and the

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.700
businesses want to know what
the interest rate is.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:26.050
The lower the interest rate,
the more they'll demand.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:32.010
So, we have a demand
curve for saving.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.460
And then the intersection of the
two is the interest rate.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.470
Well, it gives the interest
rate on this axis and the

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.530
amount of saving on
the other axis.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.440
That's a very simple story.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.740
And that's what Fabozzi et al.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.400
covers in your text.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.470
But I wanted to go back to
another diagram that Fabozzi

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.420
et al. did not include in your
textbook, but it also comes

00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:07.480
from the 1930 book, The Theory
of Interest. That is a diagram

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.590
that shows a two-period story.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.340
And the thing I liked about
this two-period diagram is

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.670
that it brings out the von
Boehm-Bawerk causes of

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.550
interest rate in a very
succinct way.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.360
So, this is the second Irving
Fisher diagram.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.180
I'm going to do a little story
telling about this.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.175
Remember the book,
Robinson Crusoe.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:37.890
It was written by Jonathan
Swift in the 1700's.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.310
It was the story of a man named
Robinson Crusoe, who was

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:48.420
marooned on an island all by
himself and had to live on his

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.650
own with no help.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.140
This is a famous story called
a Robinson Cruise economy.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.296
There's only one person in the
economy, so, of course,

00:10:57.296 --> 00:10:59.025
there's no trade.

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:03.060
But we'll move to a little
bit of trade.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.060
I'm just telling you a story of
the rate of -- there'll be

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.200
a rate of interest on Robinson
Crusoe's island.

00:11:12.275 --> 00:11:18.345
I'm going to show here
consumption today.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:29.140
And on this axis, consumption
next year.

00:11:32.968 --> 00:11:34.218
All right.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.690
I don't remember the novel.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.240
Did anyone here read it?

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.910
Somebody must have read
Robinson Crusoe.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.520
But I'm not going to be
true to the story.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.050
The story I'm going to
tell is that Robinson

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.450
Crusoe has some food.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.710
That's all that the whole
economy just does.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.180
Let's say it's grain.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.850
I don't know how he got
that on the island.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.060
But he's got grain.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.080
And he's deciding how much to
eat this year, and how much to

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.080
plant for next year.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.810
So, the total amount of grain
he has is right here.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.960
So, that is his endowment
of grain.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.900
That's the maximum
he could eat.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.010
But if he eats it all, there
won't be any grain to plant

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.810
for next year, OK?

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:24.920
So, he better not eat it all,
or he'll starve next year.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.310
Now, in a simple linear
production --

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:34.420
with technology that's linear,
he can choose to set aside a

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.270
certain amount of grain, which
is the difference between what

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.820
he has and what he's
consuming.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.560
And then that will produce
grain next period.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.690
So, I'm going to draw
a straight line.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.470
That's supposed to be
a straight line.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.560
These are all supposed to
be straight lines here.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:02.740
And that is his choice set
under linear technology.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.990
I'm drawing it with no
decreasing returns.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:14.420
The idea is that for every
bushel of grain that he

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.750
plants, he gets two bushels
next year, or

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.420
whatever it is, OK?

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:24.190
And so, if he were to consume
nothing this period,

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.200
he would have --

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.650
if I drew this thing with the
right slope of minus 2 --

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.400
he would have twice as much.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.790
This is the maximum he could
have next period, OK?

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.250
And so, he could consume
anywhere along this line.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:47.860
And this would be the simplest
Robinson Crusoe economy.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.890
So, what does he do?

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.500
Remember from elementary micro
theory, he has indifference

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.730
curves between consumption
today

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.340
and consumption tomorrow.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.430
Remember these?

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.885
These are like contours
of his utility.

00:14:00.885 --> 00:14:02.790
And we typically draw
them like this.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:07.520
So, what does he do?

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:13.180
He maximizes his utility and
chooses a point with the

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.150
highest indifference curve
touching the production

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.240
possibility frontier.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.130
This is the PPF, the

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.970
production possibility frontier.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.470
And that determines the amount
that he consumes and the

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.310
amount that he saves.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.450
And he consumes this
amount here.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:35.490
And the difference between his
endowment and his consumption

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.420
is his saving.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.660
And then next period, he
consumes this amount.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.910
All right, that's simple
micro theory.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.160
That's familiar to you?

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.290
So, in this case the interest
rate, the slope

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.605
of this line --

00:14:54.605 --> 00:15:01.810
this slope is equal to minus
1 plus r where r is

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.800
the interest rate.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.930
So, in this case, I've told
a very simple story.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.920
It has only one von Boehm-Bawerk
cause, its

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.960
roundaboutness.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.810
But maybe there's technical
progress, too, I don't know.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.730
It has maybe a couple
of his causes.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.630
If, as time goes by, Robinson
Crusoe figures out better how

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.780
to grow grain, there could be a

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.190
technical progress component.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.770
But preferences don't matter in
this story, the preferences

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.330
I represented by his
indifference curves.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.260
And since I've got a linear
production possibility

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.570
frontier, impatience
doesn't matter.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:45.150
The interest rate in this case
is decided by the technology,

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.090
the slope of the curve.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.620
So, we don't have all of von
Boehm-Bawerk causes yet.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:53.840
Next step.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.030
That was the simplest
Irving Fisher story.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:00.890
The next step is, let's suppose,
however, that there

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.930
are diminishing returns to
investment in grain.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.620
That means, for example, maybe
when he grows a little bit of

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.200
it he's very good at it and
he produces a big crop.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.510
But as he tries to grow more
grain, he gets less

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:15.950
productive.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.460
Maybe he has to do it on the
worst land or he's running out

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.370
of water, or something
is not going right.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.120
Then we would change the
production possibility

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.015
frontier, so that it
concaves down.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.490
Something like that.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.180
You see what I'm saying?

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.850
Diminishing returns
to investment.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.500
As you keep trying to add more
and more grain to your

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.880
production, as you save more
and more, you get less and

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.250
less return.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.420
So now, we have a new production
possibility

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:58.720
frontier that is more
complicated.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.510
So now, what happens?

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.160
Forget this straight line, which
I drew first, and now

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.990
consider a new production
possibility frontier that's

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.599
curved downward.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.930
Well, what does Robinson
Crusoe do?

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:16.500
Well, Robinson Crusoe picks the
highest indifference curve

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.460
that touches this production
possibility frontier.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.390
So, that means he finds an
indifference curve that's

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.560
tangent to it.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.950
And he chooses that point.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.200
OK?

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.890
So, this is what Robinson
Crusoe would do.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:42.375
Now, the interest rate is the
slope of the tangency between

00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:44.140
the indifference curve and the

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.970
production possibility frontier.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.630
It's the same for both.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.400
And this was the insight that
von Boehm-Bawerk maybe had a

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.060
little trouble getting.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.660
There's two different things
determining the interest rate.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.390
One of them is the production
possibility frontier, and the

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.780
other one is the indifference
curves.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.880
Now, we have all of von
Boehm-Bawerk causes.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.640
We've got roundaboutness, we
have technical progress, and

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.270
we have impatience.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:20.730
Well, the impatience would be
reflected by the slope of the

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.990
indifference curves.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:24.330
So, let me put it this way.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:30.790
Suppose Robinson Crusoe really
wanted to consume a lot today.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.270
He was very impatient.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.910
That means that his indifference
curves --

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.440
did you give me colored chalk?

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.420
STUDENT: There's a little
bit of yellow.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.675
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: Oh,
we have a little yellow.

00:18:43.675 --> 00:18:46.050
All right.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.380
Suppose Robinson Crusoe
is very impatient.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.370
He wants to consume.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.140
Now, he doesn't care
about the future.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:57.420
Then, his indifference
curves might look --

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.060
I'll just draw a tangency --

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.770
his indifference might
look different.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.450
They might look like this.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.960
So, he would have a tangency
further to the right,

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.000
consuming more today and
less in the future.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.830
Now, the slope here
is different than

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.900
the slope here, right?

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.350
Because I haven't changed the
production possibility

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.990
frontier but I've moved to
a different point on the

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.380
production possibility
frontier.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.670
So, you can see that if Robinson
Crusoe becomes more

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:34.900
impatient, his interest
rate goes up.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.390
Now you understand that the
interest rate in the Robinson

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:42.160
Crusoe economy is not just
about Robinson Crusoe.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.960
Even though there's only one
person in this economy, it's

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:50.290
about all of Eugen von
Boehm-Bawerk's causes.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.190
The technology is represented by
the technical progress and

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.240
the roundaboutness, and the
preferences are represented by

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.560
the indifference curves.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:04.580
And you can see that the actual
rate of interest in his

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:10.790
economy is determined
by the tangency.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.510
Now on the other hand, suppose
Robinson Crusoe were very

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.810
patient and really wants
to live for the future.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.640
Then the highest indifference
curve that touches the

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.380
production possibility
frontier might

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.210
get up here, right?

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.170
Now that's another Robinson
Crusoe with a different

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.860
personality who's
more patient.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:37.720
Then the tangency would be up
here and the interest rate

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:43.350
would be much lower, because the
interest rate would be the

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.940
slope of the line that goes
through that tangency point,

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:53.160
tangent to both the indifference
curve and the

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.930
production possibility
frontier.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.935
So. this is just a one-person
economy.

00:20:57.935 --> 00:21:01.280
Is this clear?

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.970
So, I've drawn a lot of
lines, maybe I should

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.220
start all over again.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.760
We've now gotten all of von
Boehm-Bawerk's causes of

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.870
interest. And we've got
an interest rate.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:20.080
We've tied it to production --

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.790
technology, represented by the
production possibility

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:26.100
frontier, and taste,
represented by the

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.220
indifference curve.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.275
But now I want to add a
person to the economy.

00:21:31.275 --> 00:21:34.340
So, let me start
all over again.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:38.300
There's two Robinson Crusoes
in this island.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.160
And let's start out
with autonomy.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.890
They haven't discovered
each other yet.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.675
They're on opposite sides
of the island.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.460
They have the same technology.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.950
They have the same production
possibility frontier, but they

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:56.826
live on opposite sides of the
island, and they don't trade

00:21:56.826 --> 00:21:57.520
with each other.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.396
So, let me start out again.

00:21:59.396 --> 00:22:01.970
This is the same diagram.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:09.040
We have consumption today, and
consumption next year, again.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.360
And we have a production
possibility frontier.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.300
That's the same curve
that I drew before.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.520
And the technology is the
same for both of them.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.090
And let's suppose they have
the same endowment.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:27.340
But let's suppose that Crusoe A
is very patient, and Crusoe

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.220
B is very impatient.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:36.990
So, Crusoe A, his indifference
curves form a

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.876
tangency down here.

00:22:38.876 --> 00:22:42.640
So, this is A. And Crusoe
B's indifference

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.676
curves are up here.

00:22:45.676 --> 00:22:52.590
This is B. And so, they
are planning to plant.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.450
That means that Crusoe A will
be saving very little.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:57.830
I mean, will be consuming
a lot.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.700
A is the impatient one,
the way I've drawn it.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.160
Consuming a lot now and not
saving much for the future,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.150
but is maximizing his utility.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.070
That's why we have the highest
indifference curve shown here

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.830
with this tangent.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:18.980
And Crusoe B is the
very patient one.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.700
And is consuming very little
this year and plans to consume

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.040
a lot next year.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.800
So, let's say they're
about to plant,

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.210
according to these tastes.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.970
And then they find each other.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.490
Now, they realize, there's
two of us on this island.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:36.000
Now, we're getting a real
economy with two people.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.570
So, what should they do?

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.790
Well, the obvious thing is that
there are gains to trade.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.970
And the kind of trade would
be in the loan market.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.390
This Crusoe B is suffering a lot
of diminishing returns to

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:57.920
production.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.480
So, he really shouldn't be
planting so much grain,

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.570
because he's not getting
much return for it.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.380
Whereas this other guy on the
other side of the island has

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.720
very high productivity.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.220
He can produce a lot for
a little bit of grain.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:18.220
So, he should tell Crusoe A, you
should plant some of this

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.880
grain for me.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.130
You are more productive,
because you're

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.000
not doing as much.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.640
Well, in short, what will
happen is, they'll do it

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.970
through a loan.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.610
I will loan you so much grain.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:33.860
There's no money.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.610
A wants to consume a lot.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:45.020
So, B will say, instead of
planting so much, we'll strike

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.670
a loan to allow you to consume
along your tastes.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.420
And what will happen in the
economy is, we'll find an

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.656
interest rate for the economy
that looks something --

00:24:55.656 --> 00:24:58.670
I'm going to draw a tangency.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.580
Like, that's supposed to
be a straight line.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:09.350
And on this tangent line, we
have Crusoe B has maximized

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:13.670
his utilitiy subject to that
tangent line constraint.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:20.730
And Crusoe A maximized his
utility subject to the same

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.210
constraint.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:27.800
And it has to be such a way that
the borrowing market as

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.510
shown over here clears.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:34.970
And when we have that kind of
equilibrium, you can see that

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:41.020
both A and B have achieved
higher utility than they did

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.020
when they didn't trade.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:47.530
So, this is the function
of a lending market.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:53.170
So, A who wants to -- did
I say that right?

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.430
A, who wants to consume
a lot this period --

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.970
the production point is here.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:03.410
And B lends this amount of
consumption to A, so that A

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.420
can consume a lot.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.490
He can consume this much.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:12.330
And B, since he's lent it to
A, consumes only this much

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.371
this period.

00:26:14.371 --> 00:26:16.490
But you see they're
both better off.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:20.150
They've both achieved
a higher utility.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.570
And what is the interest
rate in the economy?

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.160
The interest rate is the
slope of this line.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.795
Well, the slope of this
line is minus 1 plus

00:26:32.795 --> 00:26:35.350
the interest rate.

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:39.430
So, that is the Fisher
theory of interest.

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:41.430
And now, it's much
more complicated.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:44.090
You can see how all of Eugene
von Boehm-Bawerk's

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.770
causes play a role.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.860
But the interest rate is not
something you could have read

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.530
off from any one person's
utility.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.210
It's not just impatience.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.810
We're both complicated people.

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:01.340
We both have a whole set
of indifference curves.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:05.510
And it's not necessarily easy
to define whether or how

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:09.380
impatient am I. It interacts
with the production

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.920
possibility frontier in a
complicated way to produce a

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.750
market interest rate.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:19.870
So, this is the model for the
interest of the economy that

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.350
Irving Fisher developed.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.400
And so, I wanted to just
take that as a given.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:30.380
Now, when you put it this way,
it all looks indisputable that

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.450
the loan market is a
good thing, right?

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.630
I can't think of any criticism
of the two Robinson Crusoes

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.480
going together and
making a loan.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.020
There's nothing bad about
this loan, right?

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.000
They're just both consuming
more as a result.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.370
But I want to come back to
criticisms of lending at the

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:57.610
end of this lecture, because
I want to try to make this

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:00.280
course into something that talks
about the purpose of

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.270
finance and the real
purpose of finance.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.880
And this story is not the whole
story about real people

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.720
and how they interact with
the lending market.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:16.460
But before I do that, though,
I want to do some arithmetic

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.715
of finance.

00:28:19.715 --> 00:28:25.410
Let me move on to what I said
I would talk about, mainly

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:29.420
different kinds of bonds
and present values.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:34.230
The Irving Fisher story was very
simple, and it had only

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.750
two periods.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:45.400
So, that's too simple
for our purposes.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.670
So, what I want to talk about
now is different kinds of loan

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.490
instruments.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.682
And the first and the simplest
is the discount bond.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.070
When you make a loan to someone,
you could do it

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:09.220
between a company or between
a government and someone.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.080
A discount bond pays a fixed
amount at a future date, and

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.250
it sells at a discount today.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:21.820
It pays no interest. I mean it
doesn't have annual interest

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:22.410
or anything like that.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:27.100
It merely specifies this bond
is worth so many dollars or

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.280
euros as of a future date.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.710
And why would you buy it?

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.410
Because you pay less
than that amount.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:47.220
So, let's say that it's worth
$100 in T periods.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.170
T years.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:53.560
I'll say T years.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:30:02.540
And I made that a capital T.
So, what is a discount bond

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.980
worth today?

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.730
Now, we have an issue of
compounding, which I want to

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.590
come to in a minute, but let's
assume, first of all, that

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.420
we're using annual

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.250
compounding, and T is in years.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:26.650
Then, the price of the discount
bond today, the price

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:37.120
today, is equal to $100
all over 1 plus

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.280
r to the T-th power.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:45.290
Where T is the number of
years to maturity.

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:47.420
T years to maturity.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:31:05.280
And that's the formula.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:14.280
In other words, 1 plus r to the
T-th power is equal to 100

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:23.340
over P. So 100 over P is the
ratio of my final value to my

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.830
initial investment value if I
invest in a discount bond.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:30.280
And I want to convert that to
an annual interest rate.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:37.430
So, this is the formula that
allows me to do that.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:45.390
So, r is also called
yield to maturity.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.500
And the maturity is T,
the time when the

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.340
discount bond matures.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:56.320
So, it says if it's paying an
interest rate, r, once per

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.820
year for T years --

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.060
We can infer an interest rate
on it even though the bond

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.470
itself has a price, not
an interest rate.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:11.520
I mean, we can calculate
the interest rate

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.770
by using this formula.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.960
Now, let me come back
to compounding.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.400
This is elementary, but let me
just talk about putting money

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.190
in the bank here.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.490
So, compounding.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:41.420
If you have annual compounding,
and you have an

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.660
interest rate of r, and you
put your money in the bank

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:50.170
with annual compounding, and the
interest rate is r, that

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.980
means you don't earn interest
on interest

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.250
until after a year.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:03.700
If you put in $1 today, 1/2 a
year later you'll have 1 plus

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.460
r over 2 dollars, right?

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.470
With an interest rate r.

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:19.650
3/4 of a year later, you'll
have 1 plus 3/4r dollars.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:23.830
And then a full year later
you'll have 1 plus r.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:27.690
But now, after one year, you
start earning interest

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:30.100
on the 1 plus r.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:37.680
So, a 1/2 year after that, you
would have 1 plus r times 1

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.320
plus r over 2.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:46.200
And then two years later,
you'd have 1 plus r

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.870
squared, and so on.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:51.030
That's annual compounding.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.560
But the bank could offer you
a different formula.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.000
They could offer you

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.060
every-six-months compounding --

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.340
twice-a-year compounding.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.586
Then, here's the difference,
after 1/2 a year, you'd have 1

00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:11.449
plus r over 2, as before.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:16.160
But now, after 3/4 of a year,
you would have, instead, 1

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:24.050
plus r over 2 times 1 plus
r over 4, and so on.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:25.120
Now, what Fabozzi et al.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.530
likes to do is compounding
every six months.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:33.239
This is what might make the
textbook a little confusing.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.400
Because we naturally think
of annual compounding.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.210
A year seems like a
natural interval.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:42.630
But in finance, six months
is more natural.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.420
Because, by convention,
a lot of bonds pay

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.880
coupons every six months.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.010
So, Fabozzi et al.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:55.050
uses the letter z to
mean r over 2.

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:59.510
And his time intervals
are six months long.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.810
So, that means that the formula
that Fabozzi et al.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:07.020
gives for a discount bond
assumes a different

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.600
compounding interval.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.810
The Fabozzi et al.

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:12.620
assumption.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:21.620
He writes P equals 100 all over
1 plus z to the lower

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:27.280
case t, where the lower
case t is 2T.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.300
And so, that's the
Fabozzi et al.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.320
formula for the price
of a discount bond.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.720
Of course, it only applies at
every six months interval.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.710
He's not showing what it is at
six and a half months, or

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.070
something like that.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:44.900
So, is that clear about
compounding and

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.150
about discount bonds?

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.710
Now, a fundamental concept
in finance is

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:58.930
present discounted value.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.675
If you have a payment coming
in the future --

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:23.460
So, I have a payment in T years
or 2T six months, or we

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:24.710
could say semesters.

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:34.330
Then, the present value,
depending on how I compound --

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:37.800
Well, let's talk about
annual compounding.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.800
The present discounted value
of a payment in T years is

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:53.720
just the amount, which is $ x
divided by 1 plus r to the T.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:58.140
Or if you're compounding every
six months, it would be x all

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:08.480
over 1 plus z to the
lower case t.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.190
Lower case t equals 2T.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.670
So, whenever we ask a question
about present values we'll

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:19.570
have to make clear what
compounding interval we're

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:20.820
talking about.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:24.720
By the way there's also --

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.610
I shouldn't say by the way,
it's fundamental.

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:30.650
There's also continuous
compounding.

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:35.830
I talked about compounding
annually, or twice a year.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.980
I can do it four times a year.

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.400
If I do it four times a year,
that means I pay 1/4 of the

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.790
interest after three months,
and then I start earning

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:50.790
interest on interest after
three months, and so on.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:59.620
What if you compound
really often?

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.840
You could do daily
compounding.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.460
That would mean you would start
earning interest on

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.200
interest 365 times a year.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.493
The limit is continuous
compounding.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:26.680
And the formula for continuous
compounding is e to the rT,

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:32.620
where e is the natural
number 2.718.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.522
r is the continuously compounded
interest rate.

00:38:35.522 --> 00:38:40.825
So, your balance equals
the initial amount --

00:38:40.825 --> 00:38:42.220
what did I say?

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:47.000
$1 times e to the rT.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.250
That's continuous compounding.

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:56.700
The unfortunate thing is that
present values allow us to

00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.690
compute present values in
different ways, depending on

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:04.210
what kind of compounding
I'm assuming.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:08.920
But if I have a sequence of
payments coming in, the

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.670
present discounted value
of the sequence --

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:14.550
and suppose they come
in once a year --

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:18.640
then it'd be natural to use
annual compounding.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:24.260
And then the present discounted
value, PDV, is the

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.350
summation of the payments.

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.310
And what am I calling
them here?

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:36.970
x sub i all over 1 plus r.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:43.130
Oh no, I say x sub t over one
plus r to the t, from t equals

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.450
1 to infinity.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:50.330
And that's the present
discounted value for annual

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:53.200
compounding of annual
payments.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:58.140
And suppose the payments are
coming in every six months, as

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:02.600
they do with corporate bonds,
then it might be natural to do

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.140
compounding every six months.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:13.770
So then, we do PDV is equal to
the summation, t equals 1 to

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:21.930
infinity, x sub t, all over
1 plus r over 2 to the t.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:27.440
If I wanted to do continuous
compounding -- suppose I have

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.270
payments that are coming
in continually --

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:33.880
then the present bond's
discounted value would be the

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:42.680
integral from 0 to infinity of
x sub t e to the minus rt dt.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.090
And that would be a continuously
compounded

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:50.100
present value for a continuous
stream of payments.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.870
So, if someone is offering me
payments over time, then the

00:40:54.870 --> 00:41:03.100
payments have to be summed
somehow into a present value.

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:13.730
In finance, it often happens
that people are promising to

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.900
pay you something at various
future intervals over time,

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.740
and you have to recognize that
payments in the future are

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.980
worth less than payments
today.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:28.820
Just as a discount bond is worth
$100 in five years, but

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:33.030
it's not worth $100 today, it's
worth 100 all over 1 plus

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:35.330
r to the T, appropriately
compounded.

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:41.270
And that's true generally.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:44.050
Anything in the future
is worth less.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:47.510
So, present discounted value is
one of the most fundamental

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:50.030
concepts in finance.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.590
That whenever someone is
offering me a payment stream

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.590
in the future, you discount
it to the

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:58.470
present using these formulas.

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:02.220
So, for example, if you are
lending to your friend to buy

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.990
a house, and the person is
promising to pay you over the

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:09.910
years, then you've got to figure
out, well, what is that

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.540
payment worth right now?

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:15.180
And you would take the
present value of it.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.685
There's a few present value
formulas that are essential.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.370
And I'm going to just briefly
mention them.

00:42:28.004 --> 00:42:33.780
The present value of a consol,
or perpetuity.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:41.960
A perpetuity or a consol is an
instrument that pays the same

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.906
payment every period forever.

00:42:46.587 --> 00:42:49.430
It was named after the British
consols that were issued in

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:50.610
the 18th century.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.350
They were British government
debt that had

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:54.770
no expiration date.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.380
And the British government
promised to pay

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:04.120
you forever an amount.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.360
OK, what is the present value?

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.470
Now, we'll call the
amount that the

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.486
consol pays its coupon.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:18.460
And let's say the coupon
were GBP 1 per year.

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:24.320
If it was paying GBP 1 per year,
and we're using annual

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.140
compounding, then the present
discounted value is equal to

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:34.900
GBP 1 over the interest rate.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:40.840
That's very simple, because
this bond will

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.140
always pay you GBP 1.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:47.600
And so, what is the interest
rate on it?

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:52.120
Your GBP 1 is equal r over the
present discounted value.

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.730
So, the prices of the bond of
the consol should be the

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:58.850
payment divided by the
interest rate.

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:09.730
Another formula is the formula
for an annuity.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:14.230
An annuity is a different
kind of payment stream.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:19.800
It's a consol for a while
and then it stops.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.630
An annuity pays a fixed
payment each

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:29.985
period until maturity.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.060
So, it pays, let's say, GBP x.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.150
Let's not say GBP 1.

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:42.680
If it pays GBP x every year,
then the present

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.930
discounted value --

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:58.100
it pays GBP x from t equals
1 to T. And then it stops.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:01.250
T is the last payment.

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:10.470
Then the formula is x over r,
times 1 minus 1 all over 1

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:14.330
plus r to the T-th power.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:18.305
So, that's the annuity
formula.

00:45:18.305 --> 00:45:21.370
And that's very important,
because a lot of financial

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:22.990
instruments are annuities.

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:27.610
The most important example
being a home mortgage, a

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.020
traditional home mortgage.

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:35.600
You might take out a 30-year
mortgage when you buy a house.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.810
And the mortgage will generally
say in the United

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.330
States -- it's not so common in
other countries -- but in

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:46.210
the United States it will say
you pay a fixed amount --

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.440
well, usually it's monthly,
but let's say

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.440
annually for now --

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:58.460
a fixed amount every year as
your mortgage payment.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.080
And then you pay that
continually until 30 years

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.960
have elapsed, and then
you're done.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.210
No more payments.

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.950
The final thing I want to talk
about is a corporate bond, or

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:17.450
a conventional bond, which is
a combination of an annuity

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:19.650
and a discount bond.

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:24.180
And so, a conventional corporate
bond, or government

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:29.192
bond, pays a coupon
every six months.

00:46:29.192 --> 00:46:45.160
So, a conventional bond pays
coupon c, an amount c, in

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:49.750
dollars, pounds, or whatever
currency, every six months.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:06.160
And principal plus
c at the end.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:18.110
So, that means that it's
really an annuity and a

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:20.640
discount bond together, right?

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:28.770
And so, the present discounted
value for the conventional

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:33.030
bond would be the sum of the
present discounted value using

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:38.030
the annuity formula for x equals
c plus the present

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:42.400
discounted value of the
principal, which is

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.320
given by the --

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.880
well, it would be this one,
where you have r over 2,

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.900
because it's every six months.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.230
And then the final --

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:55.400
I think it's the final concept
I want to get at before

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:59.400
talking a little bit about
other matters.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:04.110
I want to talk about forward
rates, and the term structure

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:05.830
of interest rates.

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:12.260
Now, at every point in time
there are interest rates of

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:16.060
various maturities quoted.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:24.630
And we want to define the
forward rates implicit in

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:27.050
those maturity formulas.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:29.762
And this is covered carefully
in your textbook

00:48:29.762 --> 00:48:30.670
of Fabozzi et al.

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:34.360
I'm just going to do a very
simple exposition of it.

00:48:51.690 --> 00:49:03.730
The concept of a forward rate,
forward interest rate, is due

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:12.553
to Sir John Hicks, in his 1939
book, Value and Capital.

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:30.160
About 20 years ago, I was
writing a chapter for the

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:35.090
Handbook of Monetary Economics
about interest rates.

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:41.930
And I was trying to confirm who
invented the concept of

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:42.970
forward interest rates.

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:46.600
So, I'll build a little
story around this.

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.730
I thought it was Sir John Hicks,
reading his 1939 book,

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:53.130
and I couldn't find any
earlier reference.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:56.700
So, I asked my research
assistant, can you confirm for

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.290
me that the concept of
a forward interest

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:01.880
rate is due to Hicks.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:07.780
And my graduate student looked
around and tried to find

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:10.460
earlier references to
it and he could not.

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:13.020
Then, one day the graduate came
to me and said -- this is

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.205
like 20 years ago.

00:50:14.205 --> 00:50:17.295
The graduate said, why
don't you ask Hicks?

00:50:17.295 --> 00:50:19.660
And I said, wait a minute.

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.590
This book was written in 1939.

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:25.070
Is that man still alive?

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:26.610
And he said, I think he is.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:30.530
So, I wrote to the
United Kingdom.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.750
I found his address.

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:34.520
I forget, Cambridge or Oxford.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.800
And I said, did you invent
the concept of

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.100
forward interest rates?

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.870
And then six months went
by and I got no answer.

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:45.230
Then I got a paper letter --

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:47.920
they didn't have email
in those days --

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.710
from Sir John Hicks.

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:52.340
And it was written with
trembling handwriting.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:56.790
And he said, my apologies for
taking so long to answer.

00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:58.910
My health isn't good.

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:04.170
But he said, to answer your
question, he said, maybe I did

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:06.820
invent the concept of forward
interest rates.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:08.590
But he said, well
maybe it wasn't.

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:11.630
Maybe it was from coffee hour
at the London School of

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:15.690
Economics, where he was visiting
in the 1920's.

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:17.440
So, here we go.

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.040
Sir John Hicks is reminiscing
to me about what happened in

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:30.980
coffee time in the 1920's.

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.350
I'm just trying to convey what
he told me they were thinking.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:37.810
At any point of time, you open
the newspaper and you see

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:41.060
interest rates quoted for
various maturities.

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:43.360
That's called the term structure
of interest rates.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:51.220
For example, you will
find Treasury --

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:54.120
well, you'll find one-year rate
quotes, there'll be a

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.370
yield on one-year bonds.

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:57.820
There'll be a yield
on two years.

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.510
There'll be a yield quoted
on three-year bonds.

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:01.370
Right?

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:04.510
Let me tell you right now, for
most of the world today, if

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:08.850
you want to borrow money for one
year, it's really cheap.

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:12.630
In Europe, or the U.K.,
U.S., over much of the

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:14.045
world it's like 1%.

00:52:14.045 --> 00:52:18.030
In the U.S., it's
less than 1%.

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:21.060
It depends on who you are, what
your borrowing rate will

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.820
be, depending on your
credit history.

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.790
But if you have excellent
credit, one-year interest

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:27.170
rates are really low.

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:31.950
But if you want to borrow for 10
years, it's more like 3.5%.

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:35.510
It's higher, right?

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:37.925
And if you want to borrow for
30 years, they might charge

00:52:37.925 --> 00:52:39.175
you 4% or 5%.

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:45.475
This is the term structure of
interest rates, and it's

00:52:45.475 --> 00:52:48.180
quoted every day in
the newspaper.

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.280
Well, I should say,
I'm thinking 1925.

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.330
In 1925, you'd go to the
newspaper to see it.

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:56.290
Now you go to the internet
to see it.

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:58.740
So, newspapers don't
carry this anymore.

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:03.110
But I'm still in the mode of
thinking of Sir John Hicks.

00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:04.630
We're in 1925.

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:09.950
So, you open up the newspaper in
1925 and you get the yield

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:12.620
to maturity, or the interest
rate on various maturities.

00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:17.010
All for today.

00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:20.380
Everything that's quoted in
today's paper is an interest

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:24.570
rate between now, today, and so
many years in the future.

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:28.310
The one-year interest rate
quoted is the rate between now

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:30.540
and one year from now, right?

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:34.320
And the two-year interest rate
quoted is the rate from now to

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.890
two years from now, and so on.

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:40.980
So, Hicks and his coffee hour
people were saying, well, it

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:43.430
seems kind of one-dimensional,
because all the rates that are

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:47.260
quoted are rates between now
and some future date.

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:50.960
But what about between
two future dates.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:54.200
And then they thought about
this at coffee hours, and

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.160
someone said, well, it's kind of
unnecessary to quote them,

00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:02.130
because they're all implicit in
the term structure today.

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:04.390
And this is where the
concept of forward

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:05.740
interest rate comes.

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:08.630
And it's explained
in Fabozzi et al.

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:13.910
But I thought, I'm going to just
try to explain it in the

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:14.560
simplest term.

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.830
Once we get the concept,
it's easy.

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:20.520
And I'm going to assume annual

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:23.630
compounding to simplify things.

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:29.570
But Fabozzi, he being a good
financier, does it in

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:30.820
six-month compounding.

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:39.340
So, now the year is 1925, and
we're in coffee hour.

00:54:45.520 --> 00:55:01.650
Suppose I expect to have GBP
100 to invest in '26.

00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:06.790
It's '25 now, this is a whole
year from 1926, OK?

00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:11.280
And I want to lock in the
interest rate now.

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.780
Is there any way to do that?

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.810
I mean, I could try to go to
some banker and say, can you

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:21.610
promise me that you'll give
me an interest rate in

00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:23.410
1926 for one year.

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:27.240
The banker might do it, you
know, but I don't need to go

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.500
to a banker to do that.

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:35.190
Once I have all of these bonds
available, and if I can both

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:40.950
go long and short them,
then I can lock it in.

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:44.420
So, here's what I want to do.

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:46.950
This is what they were
discussing at coffee hour.

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:55.740
Buy, in 1925, two-year
bonds in an amount --

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:59.195
you've got to buy the
amount right --

00:55:59.195 --> 00:56:05.840
you've got to buy 1 plus r sub
2, which is the two-year

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:14.470
yield, squared, all over
1 plus r sub 1 bonds.

00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:20.290
Discount bonds.

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:24.710
They'll mature in two years.

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:44.100
And then I have to short, in
1925, one-period bond that

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:49.390
matures at GBP 100 So, suppose
I do that, what happens after

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:50.740
one period?

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.990
Well, after one period,
I owe GBP 100, right?

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:58.790
Because I just shorted
a one-period bond.

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:07.090
So, I pay GBP 100, that's
like investing GBP 100.

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:14.310
At the end, I get this amount
times GBP 100, right?

00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:17.670
Because this is the number
of bonds that I bought.

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:20.380
So, what is the return
that I get?

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:24.840
The return that I get
is the ratio --

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:35.310
well, we'll call that the
forward rate between '26 and

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:42.390
'27 as quoted in 1925.

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:47.140
And so, that forward rate, we'll
say 1 plus the forward

00:57:47.140 --> 00:58:00.720
rate, f, is equal to 1 plus r
sub 2, squared, all over 1

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.950
plus r sub 1.

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:08.300
It's just the amount
that I get.

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:13.660
What I'll get if I bought this
number of bonds, I get GBP 100

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:20.030
times this number in two periods
in 1927, but I put out

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:22.830
GBP 100 in 1926.

00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:30.590
So, the ratio of the amount that
I got at the end, in '27,

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:33.140
to the amount that I put in
in '26 is given by this.

00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:37.020
So, that's 1 plus the interest
rate I got on the bond.

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:42.490
So, you can compute
forward rates.

00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:46.830
I'm just showing it for a
one-year ahead forward rate

00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:50.300
for a one-year loan.

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:54.760
But you can compute it for any
periods further in the future

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.910
over any maturity.

00:58:56.910 --> 00:59:00.450
And this is the formula given,
it's on page 227

00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:01.640
of Fabozzi et al.

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:05.730
I'm not going to show you
the general formula.

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:09.820
The expectations theory of
the term structure is

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:12.900
a theory that --

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.510
I'll write it down.

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:22.960
Expectations theory says that
the forward rate equals the

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.540
expected spot rate.

00:59:29.590 --> 00:59:30.880
So, do you see what
I'm saying?

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:36.340
Here in 1925, I open The London
Times, and right there

00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:40.610
I have printed the whole
term structure today.

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:44.350
And I can then compute, using
forward rate formulas, the

00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:48.560
implied interest rates for
every year in the future.

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:53.070
Even out to 2010, they could
have computed --

00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:54.940
if they had bonds that
were that long --

00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:56.360
I think they had a few.

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.970
Let's see, 1925.

00:59:57.970 --> 01:00:00.390
Some bonds go out 100 years.

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:05.200
If you wanted to do the one-year
rate in 1925, for the

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:09.860
year 2011, you'd have to
find a pair of bonds.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.120
One of them maturing in
2011, and another

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.120
one maturing in 2012.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.850
And if you did that, you
could get an interest

01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:19.820
rate for this year.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:24.070
So, that was kind of the
realization that Hicks got,

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:26.480
that the whole future
is laid out here in

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.880
this morning's paper.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.560
All the interest rates for --

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.080
maybe not out to 2011 --

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.180
but out to a long time
in the future.

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.750
And so, what determines
those interest rates.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:40.740
So, Hicks, in his book, wrote,
the simplest theory is the

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:46.190
theory that these forward rates
are just predictions of

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:48.580
interest rates on those
future dates.

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:51.680
So, we could go back and see,
what were they predicting?

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.440
They weren't thinking so
clearly, definitively, about

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.880
2011, but they must've been,
because they were trading

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.580
these bonds.

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:07.080
And so, you could test whether
the expectations theory,

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.970
whether people are forming
rational expectations by

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:14.480
looking at those forecasts and
seeing, were they right?

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.600
Now there's a huge literature
on this, but

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.530
Hicks said that --

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:20.910
I'll just stop with this --

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:27.640
Hicks said that the expectations
theory doesn't

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.780
quite work, because there's
a risk premium.

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:36.150
That the forward rates tend
to be above the optimally

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:39.430
forecasted future
spot rates --

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:43.220
spot meaning, you know, as
quoted on that date --

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.540
because of risk.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:47.600
And people are uncertain about
the future, so they demand a

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:51.570
higher forward rate then
they expect to see

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:54.020
happening in the spot rate.

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:58.990
So, I will stop talking
technical things.

01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:00.520
I wanted to say something.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.780
I have so much more to
say, but I'll have to

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:08.720
limit due to time.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:12.600
What I've laid out here is a
theory of interest rates.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.590
And I've done some interest
rate calculations.

01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:18.860
And I've pointed out the
remarkable institutions we

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:24.110
have that have interest rates
for all intervals,

01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:26.980
out maybe 100 years.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:30.160
And so, it's all kind of like
the whole future is planned in

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.430
these markets.

01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:33.590
It seems impressive,
doesn't it?

01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:41.830
And when I told you the Robinson
Crusoe story, didn't

01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:42.980
that sound good?

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:47.050
Like when the two Robinson
Crusoes discover each other,

01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:49.950
aren't they obviously doing the
right thing to make a loan

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:51.200
from one to the other?

01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:57.160
And I like that.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.220
I think basically everything
I've said here

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.310
is basically right.

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:04.135
But I wanted to say that one of
the themes of this course

01:03:04.135 --> 01:03:08.860
is about human behavior and
behavioral economics.

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:14.820
And I wanted to talk a little
bit about borrowing and

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:19.990
lending, and how it actually
plays out in the real world.

01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:26.120
And how our attitudes are
changing, our regulatory

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.640
attitudes are changing.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.970
So, let me just step back.

01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:34.640
You know, I think this
literature, involving Irving

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.600
Fisher and von Boehm-Bawerk,
and many others who've

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.420
contributed to the understanding
of interest

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:44.450
rates, is very powerful
and important.

01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:48.950
And it supersedes anything that
had been written in the

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:51.100
last thousands of years.

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:54.660
They had interest rates for
thousands of years, but that

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:58.820
simple diagram, that
Fisher-diagram, came just a

01:03:58.820 --> 01:03:59.660
short time ago.

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:02.530
It's hardly long ago at all.

01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:05.770
But I wanted to step back and
think about what people said

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:10.380
about interest rates going
way back in time.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:17.110
And so, I was going to
quote the Bible.

01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:20.570
There's a Latin word.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.332
Do you know this word?

01:04:26.332 --> 01:04:29.080
[WRITES USURA]

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.920
Do you know what that
means in Latin?

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:37.850
Well actually our English word
"use" comes from it.

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:39.100
I don't know how to pronounce
it. ''Usura''

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.960
in Latin means use.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.460
And it means also interest.
Because, what is interest?

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.520
You're giving someone the
use of the money.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.480
You're not giving
them the money.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:52.140
They're getting the
use of the money.

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:55.130
And they had other words for
interest. But this ancient

01:04:55.130 --> 01:05:00.100
word had a negative
connotation.

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:04.640
It kind of meant something
immoral.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:10.692
And so, we have a word
called usury.

01:05:10.692 --> 01:05:11.750
You know this word.

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:15.290
This is English now.

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:18.730
It goes back more
than 2000 years.

01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:20.060
I actually have it
here in Latin.

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:22.540
I'm just curious about these
things, but I can't

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:23.790
pronounce it right.

01:05:27.050 --> 01:05:29.990
It must have been written
in Greek, or Aramaic, or

01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:34.260
something originally, but it
uses the word, "usury," usura.

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:38.910
But the quotation, it says in
Exodus, "If thou lend money to

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:44.750
any of my people that is poor by
thee, thou shalt not be to

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:47.880
him as an usurer.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.720
Neither shalt thou lay
upon him usury." Now

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.280
what does that mean?

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.370
Because usura could mean both
interest and excessive

01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:00.950
interest. So, it's not clear
what the Bible is

01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:02.860
saying about lending.

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:05.710
It sounds like it's telling
you you can't lend --

01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:09.400
you can lend someone money, but
don't take any interest.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.100
That's what it seems to be
saying but it's ambiguous.

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.940
I was going to quote
the Koran.

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:15.780
I don't speak Arabic.

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:19.090
I think there's a similar
ambiguity in Arabic.

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:26.390
And I'm quoting an English
translation of the Koran: "Oh

01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:27.810
you who believe.

01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:31.580
Be careful of Allah, and give
up the interest that is

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:34.800
outstanding." Or usura.

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:41.330
That has been interpreted by
modern Islamic scholars as

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:47.530
that charging interest
is ungodly.

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:50.950
And it was interpreted by
Christian scholars.

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:53.110
They go back and they try to
figure out what was meant, and

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:54.920
they couldn't figure it
out, either, then.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:58.230
Times change over
the centuries.

01:06:58.230 --> 01:07:03.710
But for thousands of years the
Catholic Church -- or maybe

01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:04.210
not thousands.

01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:05.640
I don't know the whole
history of this.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.280
It depends on which century
you're talking about.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.920
But for many centuries, the
Catholic Church interpreted

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:15.690
this, as do many Muslims today,

01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:17.760
that interest is immoral.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.790
And therefore, the only people
who were allowed to loan were

01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:24.990
Jews, because they weren't
subject to the --

01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:27.900
even though it's actually
the Book of Exodus --

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.940
but they weren't subject to
the same interpretation.

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:34.490
So, it was considered immoral.

01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:37.050
I wonder, why is that?

01:07:37.050 --> 01:07:38.180
Why is it immoral?

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.340
Because we just saw
the logic of it.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.220
Now, the Robinson
Crusoe story.

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:51.360
I had two different men on the
other side of the island.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.190
And I had one of them wanting
consumption today and of one

01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:56.500
of them wanting consumption
later.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.960
Your first question
is, maybe they

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.270
were wrong to be different.

01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:02.540
Maybe they should both be
doing the same thing.

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:06.160
Why is one of them different
than the other?

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:09.120
The guy who's going to consume
a lot today, maybe I should

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.310
have a word with this guy.

01:08:10.310 --> 01:08:11.979
You know, don't do it,
you're going to be

01:08:11.979 --> 01:08:13.250
really hungry next year.

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:15.010
Why are you doing this?

01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:19.270
So, instead of forming a loan
between the two, we should

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:20.540
advise them.

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:23.880
And maybe they don't
need a loan.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:28.590
So, this comes back to what are
we doing with our loans.

01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:33.330
And are we giving people
good advice?

01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:35.100
Or do we have a tendency in the

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:40.350
financial world to be usurious?

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:44.340
Are we going after and
victimizing people by lending

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:47.149
them money?

01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:50.069
I think that there
is a problem.

01:08:50.069 --> 01:08:55.470
And these thousands of years
of history of concern about

01:08:55.470 --> 01:09:00.870
usury have to do with real
problems that develop.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:04.340
So, just in preparing for this
lecture, on an impulse, I got

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.700
on to Google.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:10.740
And I searched on
vacation loans.

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:16.600
I found 1.6 million websites
that were encouraging you to

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.460
take out a loan to
go on a vacation.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:24.040
Now, is that socially
conscious?

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.880
I was wondering about that.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.330
Is it ever right to borrow money
to go on a vacation?

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:31.720
I mean, I've thought about it.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:35.600
And then I remembered, Franco
Modigliani, who was one of the

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.420
authors of your textbook,
and he was my teacher.

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:41.200
I still remember these moments
from classroom.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:47.010
And he was teaching us
about these subjects.

01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:50.152
He was thinking about examples
of investments --

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:51.230
and he said, you know what?

01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:56.960
One of the best investments I
can think of is a honeymoon.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.760
When you get married, you
go on a vacation.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.150
Now, why are you doing that?

01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:05.100
Is it for fun?

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:05.910
Probably not.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.120
In fact, I have a suspicion
that most

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.410
honeymoons are not fun.

01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:17.900
I think it's just people are
too uptight and tense.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.340
What have we just done?

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.300
And I bet that's right.

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.530
So, why do you do it?

01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:27.020
Well, you do it as an
investment, right?

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.205
You want this photograph
album.

01:10:29.205 --> 01:10:30.390
You want the memories.

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:32.570
You're kind of bonding.

01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:34.950
I think he's absolutely right.

01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:37.330
You should go on a honeymoon.

01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:38.460
So, I did another search.

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:41.530
I searched on honeymoon loans.

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:43.830
And I got 1.7 million hits.

01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:45.630
It beat vacation loans.

01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:48.600
So, there are many lenders
ready to lend.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.170
And you should do it.

01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:55.540
If you're just getting married
and you don't have any money,

01:10:55.540 --> 01:11:03.170
go to the usurious guy and ask
for the honeymoon loan.

01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:05.040
So, I'm not sure whether
it's bad.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.550
This is a question.

01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:08.050
I think that there
are abusers.

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:10.970
And I wanted to just close
with Elizabeth Warren.

01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:16.420
I first met her just
a few years ago.

01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.770
Well, actually, I remember
her book.

01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:20.750
She wrote some important
books.

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:24.670
She's a Harvard law professor
who wrote books.

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:28.760
One of her books was published
by Yale, called The Fragile

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.020
Middle Class.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:32.790
And it's about people who
go into bankruptcy.

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:36.030
And she points out that in the
U.S., even back in the old

01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:38.920
days when the economy was
good, we had a million

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.300
personal bankruptcies a year.

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.910
This is because of borrowing.

01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:47.300
You don't know how many
bankruptcies there are,

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:51.190
because people are ashamed when
they declare bankruptcy.

01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:53.180
And they try to cover
it up from as

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:55.030
many people as possible.

01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:58.600
There are as many personal
bankruptcies in a normal year

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.370
as there are divorces.

01:12:00.370 --> 01:12:01.680
But you don't hear about them.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:04.020
You hear about all kinds
of divorces.

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.460
People are ashamed
of divorces, too.

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.430
But they can't cover them up
because everybody knows.

01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:12.190
But they can pretty well cover
up a bankruptcy, and so they

01:12:12.190 --> 01:12:13.830
don't talk about it.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:17.370
So, what Elizabeth Warren is
saying, she thinks that the

01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:20.320
lending industry is victimizing
people.

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:25.400
It's advertising for vacation
loans and the like, and then

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:29.080
they don't tell people about the
bad things that will come.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.870
So, she wrote an article, and
this is interesting, it was in

01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:33.620
Harvard Magazine.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:37.360
And that's a magazine that I
suspect none of you read.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:40.510
Anyone read Harvard Magazine?

01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:43.760
It's the Harvard alumni
magazine.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.500
It goes out to all graduates
of Harvard.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.670
So, you don't read it, and you
probably will never read it.

01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:55.450
You will be a reader of the Yale
Alumni Magazine, which

01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:59.350
will start arriving in your
doorstep after you graduate.

01:12:59.350 --> 01:13:05.470
And it will also include your
obituary in the next century

01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:07.540
when that comes.

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:10.780
But the Harvard alumni magazine
published this

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:14.980
wonderful article about
Elizabeth, describing all of

01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:19.850
the abuses that happen in
lending in the United States.

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:21.630
I don't know how I ended
up reading it.

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:24.880
I think it was just such a
nicely written piece that it

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.680
just became one of their
success stories.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:30.580
Most people don't read that
magazine, but I read it, and a

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:31.760
lot of people have read it.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.940
And she was so successful in
convincing the public -- this

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:39.690
is just two years -- or 2008,
three years ago --

01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:44.460
she was so successful that she
got a Consumer Financial

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:49.140
Protection Bureau inserted
into the Dodd-Frank bill.

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:54.430
And we now have a regulator, a
new regulator, that's supposed

01:13:54.430 --> 01:14:00.180
to stomp on these usurious
practices.

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.750
It's kind of an inspirational
story, but the downside of it

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:05.720
is, she got too carried away
criticizing the lending

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.010
industry in that nice article.

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:12.380
And it makes them sound worse
than they really are, and so

01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:17.260
Obama could not appoint her to
head the Consumer Financial

01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:20.600
Protection Bureau, because it
would be too politically

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.320
controversial.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:26.240
So, she is now the person trying
to find someone to head

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.190
her bureau.

01:14:28.190 --> 01:14:30.720
But I think that this is just
another step, and it's

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.960
happening in Europe and
in other places.

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:36.060
The financial crisis has
made us more aware of

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:38.160
bad financial practices.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.640
And so, usury is again
on our minds.

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:44.900
Usury is abusive lending that's
taken without concern

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:47.220
for the person who's
borrowing.

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:50.280
And I think what it means
to me is that --

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.140
we'll come back to talk
about regulation in

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.190
another lecture --

01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:56.520
but that the original Irving
Fisher story and von

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.190
Boehm-Bawerk story about
interest was right.

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:02.110
And even vacation loans,
especially

01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:04.190
honeymoon loans, are right.

01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:08.810
But we need government
regulation to prevent abuses.

01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:12.280
And we do still have abuses
in the lending process.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.710
So, I'll stop with that and
I'll see you on Monday.

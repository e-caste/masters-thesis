00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.135
Professor Charles
Bailyn: I have spent a very

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:05.540
enjoyable weekend reading your
Pluto comments.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.075
No, that was fun.
It is a surprisingly--it's a

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.348
surprisingly deep topic.
There are technical issues

00:00:12.348 --> 00:00:14.230
about how orbits of planets
work.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.456
There are these interesting
cultural and political currents

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:25.384
that underlie the whole thing.
And also some sort of deep

00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:31.824
philosophy, or what the literary
professors like to call

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:35.394
"theory,"
about what it means--what it

00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:39.414
means to name something,
and what the consequences of

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:43.525
particular names are.
And so I thought I would make a

00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:47.816
couple comments on the Pluto
thing first, before we get back

00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:50.020
to the Hot Jupiters.
Let's see.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.229
The first thing I would
say--let me encourage you all,

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.620
when you get this kind of a
question--answer the question

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.082
that's asked.
The biggest problem in the

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:01.946
answers that I saw was that
sometimes you just didn't

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:04.590
address the specific question
that was asked.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.618
What I asked was,
"To what extent is the Pluto

00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:12.200
controversy a scientific
controversy?"

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.878
You don't answer that by a
narrative describing what

00:01:15.878 --> 00:01:17.522
happens.
If you say, "Well,

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:19.776
they discovered Eris,
and then that threw the

00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:22.739
scientific world into confusion,
and then they had this big

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:25.530
meeting and there was all this
fuss, and then people started to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.330
get involved who weren't
scientists,"

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.760
and so forth--that doesn't
answer the question.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.135
Because the question was,
"To what extent is this a

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:34.902
scientific controversy?"
There are two possible

00:01:34.902 --> 00:01:37.620
categories of answer to that
question.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.973
One is, "Yes,
it is primarily a scientific

00:01:40.973 --> 00:01:44.340
controversy."
And the other category is, "No.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.140
It was primarily not a
scientific controversy."

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.323
And if you didn't say one of
those things,

00:01:49.323 --> 00:01:52.359
or something somewhere in
between, then that's not kind of

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.661
responsive to the question.
I would say that you could

00:01:55.661 --> 00:01:58.456
answer that particular question
in this case,

00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:00.870
in both directions,
perfectly well.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.081
If you want to make a case that
it's a scientific issue,

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:06.241
you say, "Look,
classification is very

00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:09.553
important to science."
I made that point in class

00:02:09.553 --> 00:02:12.658
on--a week ago,
and that, you know--you've got

00:02:12.658 --> 00:02:16.521
to have your classifications
right in order to understand

00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:19.659
what's going on.
And what has happened?

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.429
Here is--new data has come in,
which has thrown the old

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.702
classifications into question.
Although, it should be noted

00:02:25.702 --> 00:02:29.315
that there wasn't officially a
definition of "planet" that goes

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:33.172
back to antiquity.
And one of the things they were

00:02:33.172 --> 00:02:37.201
trying to do was to create one.
But that--as new data came in

00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:39.010
from the outer parts of the
Solar System,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.819
we had to revise our
classifications.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.335
And this is a key point of
science, and therefore the whole

00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:46.759
thing is, at root,
a scientific issue.

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.738
But you could also argue the
opposite, in that,

00:02:49.738 --> 00:02:53.430
you know, the scientific issue
was not really in doubt.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.233
Nobody was questioning whether
Pluto and Eris and all those

00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:00.710
things ought to be in the same
category as Jupiter.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.659
Clearly they're not.
That wasn't the issue.

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.999
The reason this became so
controversial is because there

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.338
were a lot of people who
--scientists and non-scientists

00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:13.980
– who thought that it would be
nice if Pluto could remain a

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.573
planet.
And therefore,

00:03:15.573 --> 00:03:18.615
they came up with these rather
convoluted definitions,

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.771
in order to maintain the idea
that Pluto should remain a

00:03:21.771 --> 00:03:23.364
planet.
And then, they got into

00:03:23.364 --> 00:03:24.976
trouble, because fifty other
things would,

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:26.470
therefore, also have to be
planets.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.515
But it's rooted in a
non-scientific desire for Pluto

00:03:30.515 --> 00:03:34.324
to remain a planet,
and for very few other things

00:03:34.324 --> 00:03:39.392
to be admitted to this pantheon.
And that is fundamentally not a

00:03:39.392 --> 00:03:42.818
scientific thing,
and you could argue that that's

00:03:42.818 --> 00:03:45.530
the whole root of the entire
issue.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.098
Now, one of the interesting
things is that these

00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:50.830
non-scientific things affect the
scientists too.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.774
A lot of you quoted this guy,
Alan Stern, who's a

00:03:53.774 --> 00:03:56.349
planetary--a famous planetary
scientist,

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.591
who objected to the way it all
ended up by saying,

00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:03.362
look, one of the definitions
that they've put down is that

00:04:03.362 --> 00:04:05.810
you have to clear out your
orbit.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.158
And Pluto doesn't make it in
that--in that context,

00:04:08.158 --> 00:04:11.070
because it crosses the orbit of
Neptune, which is a much bigger

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.577
thing.
But, Stern goes on to say,

00:04:13.577 --> 00:04:16.790
Neptune also crosses the orbit
of Pluto.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.851
And so, obviously,
there's some hidden assumption

00:04:19.851 --> 00:04:22.848
here about, you know,
the thing that's much more

00:04:22.848 --> 00:04:25.060
massive counts,
and the thing that's less

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.051
massive doesn't count.
But that hasn't actually been

00:04:27.051 --> 00:04:28.639
stated, and so this is a lousy
definition.

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.976
And so he objected on
scientific grounds to this

00:04:31.976 --> 00:04:34.375
definition.
And some of you noted that

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:37.440
Stern is the principal
investigator of the New Horizons

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.129
Mission, but I don't think you
noted the implications of that.

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.948
The New Horizons Mission is a
planetary probe that is on its

00:04:45.948 --> 00:04:49.390
way now to Pluto.
And the reason that it was

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.608
launched--Al Gore was actually
very enthusiastic about this

00:04:53.608 --> 00:04:57.494
when he was Vice President.
The reason that this was

00:04:57.494 --> 00:05:01.896
launched was because Pluto was
the only one of the planets that

00:05:01.896 --> 00:05:05.125
Voyager didn't go to.
And so, we have these fabulous

00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:07.870
pictures of, you know,
Saturn and Uranus and Neptune.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.416
We have no fabulous pictures of
Pluto because nothing had gone

00:05:10.416 --> 00:05:12.724
there.
And in the late 1990s people

00:05:12.724 --> 00:05:14.769
thought, well,
this is dumb.

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:16.970
There is a planet out there
that hasn't been explored.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.290
We've got to have a mission to
go to this planet.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.924
So now, it's seven years
later--the mission just went

00:05:21.924 --> 00:05:24.287
past Jupiter actually.
So it's on its way out,

00:05:24.287 --> 00:05:26.682
and all of a sudden,
the thing that it's going to

00:05:26.682 --> 00:05:31.589
has been demoted.
This is awkward.

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:33.487
[Laughter.]
You know, we're spending 100

00:05:33.487 --> 00:05:36.551
million dollars of your money to
go see the last of the planets,

00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:38.399
and now it's not a planet
anymore.

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:41.149
And here's the guy who's in
charge of that mission.

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:43.647
And so, of course,
he objects to the change in

00:05:43.647 --> 00:05:46.644
definition that demotes his
object--which he's spending

00:05:46.644 --> 00:05:49.752
fifteen years of his life and
100 million dollars of your

00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:52.971
money to study--has now been
kicked out of the realm of the

00:05:52.971 --> 00:05:55.198
planets.
So, not surprising that he

00:05:55.198 --> 00:05:57.360
would take that particular point
of view.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.747
Mike Brown's another example.
That's the guy who discovered

00:06:00.747 --> 00:06:02.735
Eris.
And he has a lovely thing on

00:06:02.735 --> 00:06:05.792
his web site about how "planet"
ought to be a cultural

00:06:05.792 --> 00:06:08.365
definition.
And he kind of advocates for a

00:06:08.365 --> 00:06:11.483
thing where, because it's
cultural, you've got to keep

00:06:11.483 --> 00:06:13.717
Pluto in.
And because you've got to keep

00:06:13.717 --> 00:06:16.670
Pluto in, you've got to allow
anything bigger than Pluto.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.396
So you just have an arbitrary,
culturally enforced cutoff at

00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:22.928
the mass of Pluto.
And then--and things that are

00:06:22.928 --> 00:06:25.552
more massive get to count also,
because otherwise it would be

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.769
unfair.
Look what this does though.

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:31.691
It means Eris is a planet and
none of these other things are,

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:35.221
which means Mike Brown is one
of the four people in the

00:06:35.221 --> 00:06:38.620
history of humanity who has
discovered a planet.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.460
[Laughter.]
And so that's a very convenient

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.124
definition.
And so, you know--and then he

00:06:43.124 --> 00:06:46.519
actually very graciously goes on
to say, well,

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:49.644
I'll settle for being the
discoverer of the largest dwarf

00:06:49.644 --> 00:06:52.100
planet until a bigger one gets
discovered.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.899
But you can see,
he's not really happy about it.

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:58.790
He'd much rather the thing be
decreed the tenth planet,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.370
and perhaps reasonably so.
So, the scientists are also

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.762
affected by these kinds of
things in ways that you have to

00:07:06.762 --> 00:07:10.846
think a little bit about
before--as you interpret what

00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:15.392
their take on the scientific
parts of the controversy really

00:07:15.392 --> 00:07:17.866
are.
So let me summarize all of

00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:21.370
this--this is going to be--I
mentioned in the first class

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.873
that I was going to tell fables
about science with morals

00:07:24.873 --> 00:07:27.803
attached to them,
and that you could then explore

00:07:27.803 --> 00:07:30.759
these further in your optional
paper, if you choose to write

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:34.886
one.
So here's a fable,

00:07:34.886 --> 00:07:42.019
which is "The Demotion of
Pluto."

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:45.712
And one could ascribe a variety
of morals to this,

00:07:45.712 --> 00:07:49.856
but let me write down one
version that happens to appeal

00:07:49.856 --> 00:07:54.780
to me,
which is just the fact that I

00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:00.819
think science can be affected by
culture.

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:04.775
And you need to keep your eye
on that kind of thing when you

00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:07.389
interpret things that scientists
say;

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:10.620
particularly if they're saying
it to journalists.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.251
They're often much more
circumspect in the things that

00:08:14.251 --> 00:08:17.060
actually get published in the
journals.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.418
Okay.
There was one kind of argument

00:08:20.418 --> 00:08:24.550
that rubbed me the wrong way a
little bit when some of you said

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.157
it,
which was--people had a little

00:08:27.157 --> 00:08:31.129
bit of a tendency to say,
you know, all this definition

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:35.742
and classification stuff,
that's--the word ‘trivial' or

00:08:35.742 --> 00:08:39.811
‘silly' is sometimes used.
That's kind of unimportant,

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.929
and it detracts from the
science.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.399
And, I have to say,
I don't agree with that.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.951
I think it's important for the
science to get these

00:08:46.951 --> 00:08:49.451
classifications right,
because otherwise you don't

00:08:49.451 --> 00:08:51.899
know how to describe what you're
looking at.

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:53.990
You don't know how to interpret
it.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.491
Oh--I should mention something
about grading,

00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:58.817
I guess.
It was six points on that

00:08:58.817 --> 00:09:00.452
problem.
The way I did it was,

00:09:00.452 --> 00:09:03.125
I started out--everybody sort
of started out with five of

00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:05.838
those six points,
and if you said things that

00:09:05.838 --> 00:09:09.160
were incomplete or incoherent or
dumb in some way,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.355
you got points taken off.
But there was also an extra

00:09:12.355 --> 00:09:15.784
point you could get for being
especially coherent or

00:09:15.784 --> 00:09:18.340
especially original or
interesting,

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.163
or just generally waking me up
after I'd read forty others of

00:09:22.163 --> 00:09:24.082
them.
I bring this up just to point

00:09:24.082 --> 00:09:27.232
out that if you get five out of
six on that particular problem,

00:09:27.232 --> 00:09:29.669
that doesn't mean you've done
anything wrong.

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:32.262
It wasn't that we started with
a perfect score of six and

00:09:32.262 --> 00:09:36.421
started subtracting things off.
It just meant that I felt that

00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:41.860
there were others in the pile
who were somehow more coherent.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.172
We'll hand these things back at
the end of the class,

00:09:45.172 --> 00:09:47.823
by the way.
And I'll make some remarks

00:09:47.823 --> 00:09:51.540
about grading of the overall
problem set at the end.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:56.403
Okay.
Another general point that

00:09:56.403 --> 00:10:02.229
showed up in other parts of the
problem set was a kind of issue

00:10:02.229 --> 00:10:06.269
about velocities and the center
of mass.

00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:10.294
Let me--here's the center of
mass of some orbit,

00:10:10.294 --> 00:10:14.320
and, of course,
that's not a physical object.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.679
That's just a point in space.
And the key thing to understand

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:22.129
about the center of mass is,
the center of mass doesn't

00:10:22.129 --> 00:10:23.860
move.
It doesn't move in space.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:29.195
That's a fixed point in space.
So, this doesn't move--actually

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:33.539
I should be more precise.
Its motion doesn't change.

00:10:33.539 --> 00:10:36.412
So, if it's stationary in some
coordinate system,

00:10:36.412 --> 00:10:38.670
it sits there.
If it's moving at some

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.159
velocity, it continues to move
at precisely that velocity.

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:45.224
So the--it's--and then,
you can redefine the coordinate

00:10:45.224 --> 00:10:48.629
system so it doesn't move in
some other coordinate system.

00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:53.200
But it doesn't go around in
circles or ellipses or anything.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.560
What does go around are the
things going around it,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.642
one of which is the planet,
which is over here--the other

00:11:03.642 --> 00:11:06.500
of which is the star,
which is over here.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.926
And the way these two things
move, they have to stay one on

00:11:11.926 --> 00:11:15.950
each side in a straight line
that--woops,

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.506
I'm going to miss--in a
straight line that goes through

00:11:19.506 --> 00:11:22.910
the center of mass.
I drew that wrong,

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.770
so let me redraw it here.
There we go.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.830
Yeah.
And so it balances, right?

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.010
That's what the center of mass
is.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.136
It's the balance point.
And so the star has to stay

00:11:35.136 --> 00:11:39.790
exactly opposite to the planet.
How big are each of these

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.921
things?
Well, that depends on the ratio

00:11:41.921 --> 00:11:44.720
of the masses in an equation we
wrote down before.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.252
The consequence is that as
these things go around they stay

00:11:48.252 --> 00:11:50.809
on opposite sides of the center
of mass.

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:53.987
So the amount of time it takes
the planet to go around the

00:11:53.987 --> 00:11:57.054
center of mass--that's the
orbital period--has to be the

00:11:57.054 --> 00:12:00.399
same as the amount of time it
takes the star to go around the

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:03.139
center of mass,
also the orbital period.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:07.605
So the orbital periods,
P, are required to be

00:12:07.605 --> 00:12:13.033
the same because it has to take
them the same amount of time to

00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:17.965
go around this center of mass.
Because they have to stay on

00:12:17.965 --> 00:12:20.549
opposite sides of it the whole
time.

00:12:20.549 --> 00:12:24.609
The P is--So the orbital
period, P,

00:12:24.609 --> 00:12:28.500
is the same for the planet and
for the star,

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:36.799
whereas the velocity and the
semi-major axis are different.

00:12:36.799 --> 00:12:39.324
Because, while it takes the
same amount of time to go

00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:41.799
around, the star is going for
much less distance.

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:44.869
So the distance is shorter,
and therefore the velocity has

00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:47.440
to be less for the star.
So we can talk about the

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.316
V_star versus
V_planet and

00:12:50.316 --> 00:12:53.340
a _star versus
a _planet.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.465
And we can add these things up
to make V

00:12:55.465 --> 00:12:57.730
_total and a
_total.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.460
But you don't do that with the
period.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.650
The period is the same.
Okay.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.679
So that's an important concept.
Questions?

00:13:08.679 --> 00:13:12.413
Let me point out that this
concept of the center of mass

00:13:12.413 --> 00:13:16.350
gets more complicated when
there's more than one planet.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.398
Because again,
the center of mass is still a

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:23.580
fixed point, even when you've
got two planets – and so one

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.834
of the things--so the star is
going around the center of mass

00:13:27.834 --> 00:13:31.568
because of this planet,
but it's taking other extra

00:13:31.568 --> 00:13:35.050
little wiggles as a result--if
there's a second planet,

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:39.006
as a result of that planet.
The center of mass has to stay

00:13:39.006 --> 00:13:43.055
exactly in the same place.
And the consequence of this is

00:13:43.055 --> 00:13:47.261
that the motion of one planet is
actually a little bit affected

00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:49.840
by the gravity of the other
planet.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.620
So it, too, is executing extra
little wiggles due to the

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.463
presence of the second planet.
Those wiggles are very small

00:13:57.463 --> 00:14:00.281
compared to the motion that's
induced by the Sun,

00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:03.100
because the other planet's much
less massive.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.592
But they really are there,
and, in fact,

00:14:05.592 --> 00:14:08.979
the planet Neptune was
discovered because the orbit of

00:14:08.979 --> 00:14:12.814
Uranus had extra wiggles in it
that couldn't be accounted for

00:14:12.814 --> 00:14:16.223
by the known planets.
And so, in the nineteenth

00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:20.129
century, a couple of clever
mathematicians figured out from

00:14:20.129 --> 00:14:24.169
the motion of Uranus where
Neptune had to turn out to be,

00:14:24.169 --> 00:14:29.629
in order to explain these
extra, unexplained motions.

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:32.070
And then some astronomers
looked, and there it was.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:36.937
It was a huge triumph for
Newtonian physics and a damned

00:14:36.937 --> 00:14:39.149
hard math problem,
too.

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:44.567
And so, this concept becomes a
little more complicated in the

00:14:44.567 --> 00:14:48.539
case where there are more than
one planet.

00:14:48.539 --> 00:14:51.230
But in fact,
the way we're going to deal

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.440
with that is just to separate it
into one planet at a time.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.810
Let me give you an example of
that.

00:15:00.289 --> 00:15:03.930
Let's see, I don't think we
need to change the lighting.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.330
Woops!
Backwards.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.899
Here we go.
All right.

00:15:08.899 --> 00:15:13.428
So, this is a radial velocity
curve of some star,

00:15:13.428 --> 00:15:16.730
and it--you can see these
points.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:21.075
Here are the observed radial
velocities at a variety of times

00:15:21.075 --> 00:15:23.899
over a course of three or four
years.

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:27.196
And then they've drawn in a
sine curve--or it's actually not

00:15:27.196 --> 00:15:29.799
quite a sine curve.
It's close to a sine curve.

00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:33.447
And you can see that the sine
curve more or less goes through

00:15:33.447 --> 00:15:35.818
these points,
which is nice because that

00:15:35.818 --> 00:15:38.190
indicates the presence of a
planet.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:41.481
And you have velocity over
here, but I should mention

00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:44.914
something about velocity.
What they mean is not actually

00:15:44.914 --> 00:15:47.705
velocity.
What they mean here is radial

00:15:47.705 --> 00:15:49.730
velocity.
And this is an important point.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:54.769
It's not that the speed changes.
What changes is--between here

00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:59.169
and here on this plot – is not
the speed of the thing,

00:15:59.169 --> 00:16:02.647
but its direction.
Because at plus 200,

00:16:02.647 --> 00:16:08.220
that means it's going away from
you at 200 meters per second.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.430
At minus 200,
it means it's coming toward you

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.433
at 200 meters per second.
That's why you can have a minus

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:18.608
velocity.
At zero, it does not mean that

00:16:18.608 --> 00:16:22.182
the thing has stopped.
It's going at the same speed as

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:25.044
it was up here and the same
speed as it goes down here,

00:16:25.044 --> 00:16:28.427
but in a different direction.
So, it's going still at

00:16:28.427 --> 00:16:32.389
200-plus meters per second,
only it's going sideways.

00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:35.551
And so it's neither coming
toward you nor going away from

00:16:35.551 --> 00:16:37.611
you.
Therefore, its radial velocity

00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:40.080
is zero, and you measure no
Doppler shift.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.692
Remember these plots are
created by measuring the Doppler

00:16:42.692 --> 00:16:45.444
shift, and the Doppler shift
tells you how fast something is

00:16:45.444 --> 00:16:47.870
either coming toward you or
going away from you.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:51.352
So, that's an important point.
You can have dramatic changes

00:16:51.352 --> 00:16:55.661
from positive to negative in the
radial velocity without changing

00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:59.271
the speed of the object at all.
All you have to do is change

00:16:59.271 --> 00:17:01.398
its direction.
So first, it comes toward you,

00:17:01.398 --> 00:17:03.716
then it goes sideways,
then it goes away from you,

00:17:03.716 --> 00:17:06.936
then it comes sideways again.
So that's what this plot

00:17:06.936 --> 00:17:09.338
represents.
And you can see that these

00:17:09.338 --> 00:17:12.436
points go up and down,
as they should if something is

00:17:12.436 --> 00:17:14.700
in orbit around the center of
mass.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.987
And these little points down at
the bottom are--represent the

00:17:17.987 --> 00:17:20.919
difference;
actually, they've put it down

00:17:20.919 --> 00:17:23.980
here, this should be zero on the
scale.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.600
This is the difference between
the observed points and this

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.410
sinusoidal model that they've
put up there.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:34.224
So, they've just calculated the
differences, and there's some

00:17:34.224 --> 00:17:36.996
scatter.
But it basically follows pretty

00:17:36.996 --> 00:17:41.132
well, the scatter is a whole lot
less than the changes in the

00:17:41.132 --> 00:17:42.854
velocity.
But it turns out,

00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:45.789
you can do better than this.
And here is an example.

00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:50.592
Now, what the line is now is
not one, but two sine curves

00:17:50.592 --> 00:17:54.536
added together,
one of which was the one we saw

00:17:54.536 --> 00:17:57.480
before.
So they fit for two planets now.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.429
And the other is another sine
curve with a different

00:18:01.429 --> 00:18:06.154
amplitude, because that planet
induces a smaller motion in the

00:18:06.154 --> 00:18:09.019
star and also a different
period.

00:18:09.019 --> 00:18:13.780
And so, at certain points,
the periods line up and you get

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.360
big deviations.
Then at other points,

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.401
you get wiggles on top of
wiggles, and these things kind

00:18:19.401 --> 00:18:23.509
of beat against each other.
So this complicated pattern of

00:18:23.509 --> 00:18:27.920
this line here is just two sine
waves added together.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.890
And now, the points line up
much better.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:36.394
If you recall,
these deviations between the

00:18:36.394 --> 00:18:41.864
points in the lines before were,
you know, of up to,

00:18:41.864 --> 00:18:45.870
say 50 meters a second.
And now they're much smaller.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.369
The things fit much better.
I'll show you a blowup now of

00:18:49.369 --> 00:18:52.896
this region of the plot where a
lot of these points are,

00:18:52.896 --> 00:18:56.799
and you'll see what I mean.
Here are the points.

00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:59.714
Here is the line,
and you can see that this

00:18:59.714 --> 00:19:03.529
complicated line really fits
these points quite well.

00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:07.390
That's evidence that there are
two planets in this system.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.573
But, in fact,
it gets even better than that

00:19:09.573 --> 00:19:12.380
because what they then did was
they said, all right.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.970
Here's what we're going to do.
We're going to take these

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.600
so-called residuals.
We're going to subtract off our

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.387
two-planet model.
And we're going to see whether

00:19:19.387 --> 00:19:22.824
we can see anything interesting
going on in what's left over

00:19:22.824 --> 00:19:25.619
after those two planets have
been taken away.

00:19:25.619 --> 00:19:29.099
And when they did that,
they saw this.

00:19:29.099 --> 00:19:33.608
This is--they sort of grouped
them all together,

00:19:33.608 --> 00:19:39.556
and they found something with a
period of 1.9 days that now has

00:19:39.556 --> 00:19:45.312
what looks like a sinusoidal
wiggle of about a few meters per

00:19:45.312 --> 00:19:48.582
second.
Remember, where we started,

00:19:48.582 --> 00:19:53.076
the deviations were 200 meters
a second, but you now subtract

00:19:53.076 --> 00:19:57.869
off this--these two planets –
and you're left with a third.

00:19:57.869 --> 00:20:01.094
And so this system is now
known--this particular star that

00:20:01.094 --> 00:20:04.658
they were observing is now known
to have three different planets

00:20:04.658 --> 00:20:08.630
around it,
of which this one is the one

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:13.059
that has the shortest orbit,
1.9 days.

00:20:13.059 --> 00:20:15.949
So there are now several
examples of things in which we

00:20:15.949 --> 00:20:19.267
know that there's actually more
than one planet in one of these

00:20:19.267 --> 00:20:21.904
systems.
And this is how we find that

00:20:21.904 --> 00:20:26.180
out that the motion of the star
is not just one sine curve,

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.647
but the superposition of two
– or, in this case,

00:20:29.647 --> 00:20:33.024
even three of these things.
Now, one of the interesting

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:35.231
things about this is it's quite
a short orbit,

00:20:35.231 --> 00:20:37.029
1.9 days.
That's one of the shortest

00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:39.941
orbits known.
It also has a relatively low

00:20:39.941 --> 00:20:42.663
amplitude.
The velocity--the radial

00:20:42.663 --> 00:20:45.259
velocity changes are quite
small.

00:20:45.259 --> 00:20:49.789
So, the induced speed in the
star is quite small.

00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:53.277
Those two things put together
give you a relatively low mass

00:20:53.277 --> 00:20:57.059
of the planet for reasons I'll
make specific in just a second.

00:20:57.059 --> 00:21:00.108
This is one of the lowest mass
planets that's been discovered

00:21:00.108 --> 00:21:02.384
in this way.
It's only about ten times the

00:21:02.384 --> 00:21:05.834
Earth's mass.
That's kind of comparable to--a

00:21:05.834 --> 00:21:09.049
little less than Neptune and
Uranus.

00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:12.574
And so, in this case,
it isn't actually clear whether

00:21:12.574 --> 00:21:16.233
you should think about this
thing as a kind of low-mass

00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:19.079
outer planet or a big Earth-like
rock.

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:22.519
And so, that isn't clear in
this particular case.

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:27.890
Let me make this a little more
specific here.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:32.078
What are the inputs that you
need to know to figure out how

00:21:32.078 --> 00:21:36.194
big--what the amplitude of that
sine curve is--how big the

00:21:36.194 --> 00:21:39.068
wiggles are?
You need to know a couple of

00:21:39.068 --> 00:21:41.476
things.
You need to know the velocity

00:21:41.476 --> 00:21:44.450
of the planet,
which isn't what you observe.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.420
Remember, you're observing the
velocity of the star.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:51.933
So, velocity of the planet,
which is approximately equal to

00:21:51.933 --> 00:21:56.764
the total velocity.
As one of the exercises on your

00:21:56.764 --> 00:22:02.525
problem set, you can demonstrate
that that is equal to GM

00:22:02.525 --> 00:22:04.637
/ a,
 the square root of

00:22:04.637 --> 00:22:09.099
GM over a.
So that means--Yeah?

00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:10.290
[Unintelligible student voice.]
Oh, yes.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.839
Good.
Thank you.

00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:13.630
[Adjusts overhead projector.]
How about that?

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.960
Yeah.
Okay.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:24.482
So, this means short orbits
give you small a,

00:22:24.482 --> 00:22:30.640
large velocities of the planet.
This makes sense.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.216
If you're in close to the star,
you have to move faster to keep

00:22:34.216 --> 00:22:36.327
yourself in orbit.
But, of course,

00:22:36.327 --> 00:22:40.157
you don't observe the velocity
of the planet--you observe the

00:22:40.157 --> 00:22:43.444
velocity of the star.
The velocity of the star is

00:22:43.444 --> 00:22:47.150
equal to the velocity of the
planet, times the mass of the

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.490
planet over the mass of the
star.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:23:06.490
And so, large planet masses
generate large star velocities.

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:10.063
So the two things you need to
know is: how short is the orbit

00:23:10.063 --> 00:23:15.227
and how massive is the planet.
And so if you have a short

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:22.369
orbit, that'll give you high
V _planet.

00:23:22.369 --> 00:23:26.099
And if you observe--so you
observe the short orbit.

00:23:26.099 --> 00:23:29.614
And the other thing--if the
other thing you observe is a

00:23:29.614 --> 00:23:35.023
low, relatively speaking,
V _star,

00:23:35.023 --> 00:23:42.980
then it must be true that you
have a low planet mass.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.501
Because if this is big and this
is small, you've got to

00:23:47.501 --> 00:23:51.940
compensate for it by having a
small value out here.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.920
And we'll come back to this
kind of reasoning in a minute.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.140
Does that make sense?
So in fact, that particular

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:04.149
planet with its very short
orbital period but its low

00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:08.869
induced velocity in the star--so
short period,

00:24:08.869 --> 00:24:12.454
short semi-major axis,
but also small V

00:24:12.454 --> 00:24:16.039
_star,
is the lowest mass planet,

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:20.345
I think, at this point,
that has been observed by this

00:24:20.345 --> 00:24:24.009
particular method.
Okay.

00:24:24.009 --> 00:24:27.728
But as it turns out,
most of the ones--the

00:24:27.728 --> 00:24:33.260
short-period planets--that have
been observed are more massive

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.314
than that.
And we've got these Hot

00:24:36.314 --> 00:24:38.367
Jupiters.
And so the argument here,

00:24:38.367 --> 00:24:40.871
using the same kind of
reasoning, is that you have

00:24:40.871 --> 00:24:41.740
short periods,

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.501
moderate values,
moderate to high values as

00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:52.240
these things go for V
_star,

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:58.720
and that tells you it's a
massive planet.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.607
And as I pointed out last time,
this is deeply disturbing in

00:25:03.607 --> 00:25:08.660
terms of what we know or what we
think we know about planetary

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.995
formation.
So, short period plus massive

00:25:13.995 --> 00:25:21.337
is, to put it mildly,
unexpected--so unexpected that

00:25:21.337 --> 00:25:27.240
they almost weren't discovered
at all.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.797
What happened,
this--the discovery of the

00:25:29.797 --> 00:25:32.609
planet around 51 Pegasus
happened in 1995.

00:25:32.609 --> 00:25:35.735
And the way this worked out
was, there was a team of

00:25:35.735 --> 00:25:38.369
astronomers, Geoff Marcy and
Paul Butler,

00:25:38.369 --> 00:25:40.088
chief among them,
in California,

00:25:40.088 --> 00:25:43.138
who had the best equipment for
doing these kinds of very

00:25:43.138 --> 00:25:45.799
high-precision radial velocity
measurements.

00:25:45.799 --> 00:25:48.688
And they had embarked on a
campaign to find Jupiter-like

00:25:48.688 --> 00:25:51.000
planets, which they thought they
could do.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.279
And they were piling up data on
many stars.

00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:55.369
They were looking at many
Sun-like stars.

00:25:55.369 --> 00:25:58.936
And then one day in 1995,
they woke up and a bunch of

00:25:58.936 --> 00:26:02.845
people in Switzerland announced
the discovery of the first

00:26:02.845 --> 00:26:05.473
planet,
which disturbed them mightily,

00:26:05.473 --> 00:26:08.763
because they had been scooped.
And, it disturbed them even

00:26:08.763 --> 00:26:11.721
more when they discovered that
the particular star that this

00:26:11.721 --> 00:26:14.628
planet was around--this 51
Pegasus thing that I was talking

00:26:14.628 --> 00:26:17.636
about last time – was one of
the stars that they themselves

00:26:17.636 --> 00:26:20.108
had been observing.
But the thing was,

00:26:20.108 --> 00:26:22.770
the period, you remember,
was four days.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:27.312
And Marcy and Butler and Co.
were expecting the periods to

00:26:27.312 --> 00:26:30.406
turn out to be ten years.
So they hadn't checked to see

00:26:30.406 --> 00:26:32.579
whether there were four-day
variations.

00:26:32.579 --> 00:26:35.191
And as soon as this paper by
these other astronomers,

00:26:35.191 --> 00:26:37.602
these Swiss astronomers who
discovered the thing,

00:26:37.602 --> 00:26:39.359
was published,
they said, damn!

00:26:39.359 --> 00:26:42.660
We've got a big pile of data on
this particular object in our

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.804
desk drawer.
We ought to take a look and see

00:26:44.804 --> 00:26:46.400
whether these other guys are
right.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.518
So they looked at it and within
a week of re-analyzing their

00:26:50.518 --> 00:26:54.846
data, they were able to confirm
the fact that this really was a

00:26:54.846 --> 00:26:58.749
planet in a four-day orbit.
And, annoyingly to them,

00:26:58.749 --> 00:27:02.807
they already had the data that
they could've announced it

00:27:02.807 --> 00:27:05.212
first,
if they'd looked at it and

00:27:05.212 --> 00:27:08.514
asked the question,
"Does this thing actually have

00:27:08.514 --> 00:27:11.401
a four-day orbit?"
But it didn't occur to them

00:27:11.401 --> 00:27:14.289
because it's well known,
you can't have a Jupiter in a

00:27:14.289 --> 00:27:16.440
four-day orbit.
So, they kind of didn't check.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:26.009
So here's another fable for
you, "The Discovery of 51-Peg

00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:29.337
b."
That's how you label these

00:27:29.337 --> 00:27:31.557
planets.
A is the star,

00:27:31.557 --> 00:27:35.108
B is the planet.
And the moral--I guess you

00:27:35.108 --> 00:27:37.210
could say this in a couple of
ways.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.160
One would be to say,
"Expect the unexpected."

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:45.990
And the other would just be to
say, "Look at your data."

00:27:50.079 --> 00:27:53.857
But look at your data so that
you could see things that aren't

00:27:53.857 --> 00:27:56.829
the thing that you expect to see
in your data.

00:27:56.829 --> 00:28:02.720
And that's kind of an important
lesson, I think.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.932
Anyway, it turned out,
it was relatively easy to find

00:28:06.932 --> 00:28:10.253
these Hot Jupiters,
and within a few years

00:28:10.253 --> 00:28:12.930
they--Marcy,
and Butler, and the Swiss,

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.010
and some other teams as well
– had found literally dozens

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:20.105
of these things.
So within a few years,

00:28:20.105 --> 00:28:26.977
there was dozens of Hot
Jupiters known around many

00:28:26.977 --> 00:28:28.240
stars.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.759
And so they hadn't yet,
of course, found anything like

00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:40.862
our own Solar System.
Because they hadn't been

00:28:40.862 --> 00:28:43.264
looking for ten years yet.
The orbit of Jupiter,

00:28:43.264 --> 00:28:45.099
you will remember,
is ten years long.

00:28:45.099 --> 00:28:50.502
So, they found all these Hot
Jupiters, and this might have

00:28:50.502 --> 00:28:56.188
suggested that ordinary Solar
Systems are rare--Solar Systems

00:28:56.188 --> 00:29:01.819
like our own.
Planetary systems are rare.

00:29:01.819 --> 00:29:04.472
But I'll put a question mark
after that, because it isn't

00:29:04.472 --> 00:29:06.319
really at all clear that that's
true.

00:29:06.319 --> 00:29:12.808
And the reason is that Hot
Jupiters are easier to find than

00:29:12.808 --> 00:29:18.738
ordinary Solar Systems,
for exactly the reasons that I

00:29:18.738 --> 00:29:26.442
wrote down just a minute ago.
The fact that they have short

00:29:26.442 --> 00:29:33.774
periods and massive planets
generates larger values of

00:29:33.774 --> 00:29:39.026
V_star.
Both of those factors make for

00:29:39.026 --> 00:29:41.805
large values of the thing that
you're actually trying to

00:29:41.805 --> 00:29:44.130
observe, which is the velocity
of the star.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:45.952
So, of course,
if you go out and you have some

00:29:45.952 --> 00:29:48.220
new technology and you're trying
to observe something,

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.145
the first ones you'll observe
are the ones that have the

00:29:52.145 --> 00:29:56.000
largest signal of the kind
you're trying to observe.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.125
So if you're observing radial
velocities, you're trying to

00:29:58.125 --> 00:29:59.430
measure V
_star,

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.773
the first ones that are going
to pop out at you are the ones

00:30:02.773 --> 00:30:06.439
with large values of that.
It's also true that it's easier

00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:08.720
to observe these shorter
periods.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:19.519
If you've got a four-day period
and you observe the thing for a

00:30:19.519 --> 00:30:22.530
month, you've watched it go back
and forth, you know,

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:26.067
eight times or something.
If you want to wait for eight

00:30:26.067 --> 00:30:29.717
orbital periods of Jupiter,
that's 80 years--and it's just

00:30:29.717 --> 00:30:33.075
going to take you longer.
There's a general rule in

00:30:33.075 --> 00:30:36.581
science that no project can take
longer than it takes one

00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:39.712
graduate student to get a Ph.D.
Because, of course,

00:30:39.712 --> 00:30:42.137
it's the graduate students who
do all the work,

00:30:42.137 --> 00:30:45.302
and it's just hard to recruit a
graduate student to work on a

00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:48.150
project that won't be completed
until they're 70.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:53.466
And so these shorter periods
are easier to observe,

00:30:53.466 --> 00:30:58.183
just because they're short,
in addition to the fact that

00:30:58.183 --> 00:31:01.099
the thing you're observing is
much easier to see.

00:31:01.099 --> 00:31:02.900
This is called a "selection
effect."

00:31:08.619 --> 00:31:11.917
So you're just more likely to
see certain kinds of objects

00:31:11.917 --> 00:31:14.635
than others for the
straight-forward reason that

00:31:14.635 --> 00:31:17.561
they're easier to see.
And those will be the ones you

00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:19.418
find first.
And if you don't take this into

00:31:19.418 --> 00:31:21.829
account in thinking about the
statistics of these things,

00:31:21.829 --> 00:31:23.502
you're going to screw up
because, of course,

00:31:23.502 --> 00:31:26.241
you see the easy ones first.
Of course, you see lots of them

00:31:26.241 --> 00:31:28.904
before you see the others.
Nevertheless,

00:31:28.904 --> 00:31:34.183
the existence of even one Hot
Jupiter was a crisis for

00:31:34.183 --> 00:31:39.727
planetary formation theories.
Because there's no way any such

00:31:39.727 --> 00:31:47.620
thing ought to exist.
But even one Hot Jupiter messes

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:53.761
up our theory;
so, I'll just write that down,

00:31:53.761 --> 00:31:58.268
"messes up theory."
And so, as soon as even the

00:31:58.268 --> 00:32:03.554
first of these was discovered,
people started to think about

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:08.797
what the alternatives might be.
And there are two kinds of

00:32:08.797 --> 00:32:11.925
alternatives,
ways to explain the data

00:32:11.925 --> 00:32:18.540
without having a Hot Jupiter.
So, alternative number one was

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:25.448
that a so-called "low
inclination double star" – so,

00:32:25.448 --> 00:32:32.084
I'll explain that in a second.
The second object in this is

00:32:32.084 --> 00:32:35.003
supposed to be a star,
not a planet,

00:32:35.003 --> 00:32:39.589
and there are known double
stars with short periods.

00:32:39.589 --> 00:32:41.259
They're formed in a very
different way.

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:44.065
Double stars don't form--the
second star doesn't necessarily

00:32:44.065 --> 00:32:46.109
form out of a disk around the
first star.

00:32:46.109 --> 00:32:50.011
It's formed--I don't know –
by splitting the star in half at

00:32:50.011 --> 00:32:52.250
some early part of its
evolution.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.650
And so you get a very different
expectation for what kinds of

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.369
periods you have,
and there are many double stars

00:32:58.369 --> 00:33:00.750
known with short periods of this
kind.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:03.647
But so, then,
how do you explain--if it was a

00:33:03.647 --> 00:33:07.599
double star, you would expect
that the induced velocity would

00:33:07.599 --> 00:33:09.846
be much,
much bigger because the star is

00:33:09.846 --> 00:33:12.211
much more massive.
And so, what you do is,

00:33:12.211 --> 00:33:15.793
you explain it by saying,
well, here is your--here is you

00:33:15.793 --> 00:33:19.760
observing it and the orbit,
the orbital plane is like this.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.292
It goes up and down.
So the stars are orbiting each

00:33:23.292 --> 00:33:26.624
other this way.
So they neither come toward you

00:33:26.624 --> 00:33:30.337
very much, nor go away from you.
And therefore,

00:33:30.337 --> 00:33:34.766
the velocity is high,
but the radial velocity,

00:33:34.766 --> 00:33:38.900
which is the thing you observe,
is low.

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:49.977
So, high velocity,
but low radial velocity because

00:33:49.977 --> 00:33:59.020
the system is going
sideways--orbits are,

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:11.680
the technical term here is
"face-on," not "edge-on."

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:11.840
Okay.

00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:19.630
So, that was one hypothesis.
This didn't work out for two

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.551
reasons.
Problem number one,

00:34:22.551 --> 00:34:28.370
no evidence for light from more
than one star.

00:34:36.039 --> 00:34:38.019
Stars are much brighter than
planets, right?

00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:40.687
So, if you're looking at a
star-planet system,

00:34:40.687 --> 00:34:43.710
all you expect to see is the
light from one star.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:47.167
And that's what is observed.
If you've got a second star in

00:34:47.167 --> 00:34:50.119
that system, the second star
shines like a star.

00:34:50.119 --> 00:34:53.610
And so, you would expect to see
some evidence of light from a

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:57.159
second star in that system,
and none of those was observed.

00:34:57.159 --> 00:35:00.240
The other problem is a kind of
statistical one.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.816
There are many Hot Jupiters.
Now, if you're going to explain

00:35:06.816 --> 00:35:11.200
all these things by having
face-on orbits with respect to

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.230
us,
imagine what some observer

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.809
somewhere else in the
galaxy--with all these

00:35:15.809 --> 00:35:18.750
things--here's us in the middle
of our galaxy,

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:22.086
or somewhere in our galaxy.
And all these objects happen to

00:35:22.086 --> 00:35:25.090
be lined up exactly face-on
toward us.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:29.898
Some other astronomers would
have to see them edge-on and so

00:35:29.898 --> 00:35:32.580
forth.
So why is it--what cosmic

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:37.454
conspiracy has caused all these
things to be lined up face-on

00:35:37.454 --> 00:35:39.977
toward us?
It's as if someone had

00:35:39.977 --> 00:35:43.712
carefully set up all these
double star systems to fool us

00:35:43.712 --> 00:35:46.579
into thinking that Hot Jupiters
existed.

00:35:46.579 --> 00:35:50.480
This is the kind of argument
that people tend to reject

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.670
because it requires that we are
in a very special place,

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.710
or that some very special
coincidence has taken place.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:01.365
And that isn't--and as you keep
finding more and more of these

00:36:01.365 --> 00:36:04.301
things, you wonder,
well, how come--aren't some of

00:36:04.301 --> 00:36:06.657
them lined up edge-on?
And in fact,

00:36:06.657 --> 00:36:10.314
it has to be very close to
face-on, and so the odds that

00:36:10.314 --> 00:36:14.169
all of these things are face-on
to within plus or minus one

00:36:14.169 --> 00:36:18.092
degree starts to become really
small as you pile up more and

00:36:18.092 --> 00:36:23.983
more of these objects.
Many Hot Jupiters--they can't

00:36:23.983 --> 00:36:27.831
all be face-on.
And so, as more and more of

00:36:27.831 --> 00:36:31.770
these things were discovered you
could explain any one or perhaps

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.539
two of them as being face-on
star systems.

00:36:34.539 --> 00:36:39.015
But it starts to get more and
more difficult to believe that

00:36:39.015 --> 00:36:41.670
all of them are in that
category.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:46.146
Okay.
Let me see--what do I want to

00:36:46.146 --> 00:36:47.139
do here?
Okay.

00:36:47.139 --> 00:36:54.440
Alternative number two is
pulsating stars.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.579
Now, this is interesting.
Stars do pulsate.

00:37:01.579 --> 00:37:04.429
The Sun pulsates just a little
bit, not enough so that you

00:37:04.429 --> 00:37:07.230
could see it in this way,
but there are other stars known

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.260
that pulsate by large amounts.
They go out, they go in.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.329
Think about what happens if you
observe a pulsating star.

00:37:13.329 --> 00:37:17.400
Here it is when it's small but
getting bigger.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.280
So, all of the star is
expanding.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.747
But if you look at that star,
you only see the half of the

00:37:24.747 --> 00:37:27.119
star that's on your side of the
star.

00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:32.090
So you only see this part over
here.

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:37.530
And all of the surface of that
star is coming toward you.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.072
Right?
Because this part--it's

00:37:39.072 --> 00:37:40.739
expanding--so this part's coming
toward you;

00:37:40.739 --> 00:37:42.562
this part's going
half-sideways,

00:37:42.562 --> 00:37:44.969
half-toward you.
This part's going

00:37:44.969 --> 00:37:47.510
half-sideways,
half-toward you.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.955
So if you add up the light from
all this, it has a net bulk

00:37:50.955 --> 00:37:54.355
motion coming toward you.
Now, supposing you look at it

00:37:54.355 --> 00:37:57.699
when it's at a different part of
its pulsation cycle.

00:37:57.699 --> 00:38:03.180
So now it's big,
but going--but falling in.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:08.423
Now, you'll see the opposite.
All of the parts of this star

00:38:08.423 --> 00:38:11.644
are moving away from you.
Some are moving sort of

00:38:11.644 --> 00:38:14.739
sideways, but others are moving
away from you.

00:38:14.739 --> 00:38:21.704
And so you expect that if you
observe a pulsating star you'll

00:38:21.704 --> 00:38:26.000
see first positive radial
velocity,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.315
then negative radial velocity,
then--as it pulses back out

00:38:30.315 --> 00:38:35.187
again--positive radial velocity.
And that starts to sound very

00:38:35.187 --> 00:38:36.469
familiar.
Right?

00:38:36.469 --> 00:38:38.120
That's pretty much what we
observe.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.563
It goes up, it goes down.
And so the suggestion was that

00:38:42.563 --> 00:38:47.350
these things might actually be
some kind of pulsating star.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.555
Okay.
So, problems with the pulsating

00:38:50.555 --> 00:38:52.150
star explanation.

00:38:56.059 --> 00:39:02.356
Basically, solar-type stars,
which these were--stars aren't

00:39:02.356 --> 00:39:08.110
supposed to pulsate like
this--aren't supposed to have

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:10.390
large pulsations.

00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:24.148
And it's also true that
pulsations, in general,

00:39:24.148 --> 00:39:35.050
don't lead to sinusoidal
variations in radial velocity.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:38.515
An orbit naturally gives rise
to a sine wave if the orbit's

00:39:38.515 --> 00:39:41.097
close to circular.
Pulsations--there's no

00:39:41.097 --> 00:39:43.619
particular reason to have that
pattern.

00:39:43.619 --> 00:39:46.363
You could have sudden rises and
then gradual decays and then

00:39:46.363 --> 00:39:49.000
things of that nature.
You don't expect it to be

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.288
sinusoidal.
But both of these things--you

00:39:51.288 --> 00:39:53.699
know, what's weirder?
That there a lot of Hot

00:39:53.699 --> 00:39:56.425
Jupiters in the world,
or that you have some kind of

00:39:56.425 --> 00:39:59.579
pulsation mechanism that you
haven't experienced before.

00:39:59.579 --> 00:40:03.464
Both of them are sort of
equally in violation of current

00:40:03.464 --> 00:40:07.560
theory, and so you might as well
assume that you have weird

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.880
pulsations as well as having
weird planets.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.750
However, it turns out that the
pulsation theory makes a

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:14.920
testable prediction.

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:25.823
And to explain this prediction
I have to take a little

00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:30.050
digression and talk a little bit
about how Doppler shifts are

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:37.740
actually measured.
So, measuring Doppler shifts.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:47.920
What you do is you look at
what's called a spectrum.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:53.810
Those of you who--no,
gosh, I've spelled that wrong.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:58.551
"Spectrum."
Spectrum is just a plot of

00:40:58.551 --> 00:41:02.110
intensity, how much light there
is, against wavelength.

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:14.640
And if you work out--if you
measure the spectrum of any

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:20.021
particular astronomical object,
you'll see that at certain

00:41:20.021 --> 00:41:26.440
wavelengths there is much less
intensity or much more intensity

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:31.295
than at many other wavelengths.
So, you'll get a plot that

00:41:31.295 --> 00:41:34.728
looks kind of like this.
There'll be certain specific

00:41:34.728 --> 00:41:39.101
wavelengths that have abnormally
large or abnormally small

00:41:39.101 --> 00:41:41.940
amounts of light coming from
them.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.866
These are referred to as
spectral features,

00:41:44.866 --> 00:41:46.400
or sometimes,
lines.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.007
And when you have too little,
these are called absorption

00:41:49.007 --> 00:41:49.380
lines.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:57.292
These are called emission lines
because you have extra emission

00:41:57.292 --> 00:42:01.920
or absorption of radiation at
those particular wavelengths.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.787
There's a good explanation of
why this happens from atomic

00:42:04.787 --> 00:42:09.349
physics.
I won't go into it in detail,

00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:17.610
but let me just say that there
are specific wavelengths with

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:25.030
much less or much more
emission--or more emission--and

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:34.409
each one of those wavelengths is
caused by atomic transitions,

00:42:34.409 --> 00:42:40.260
which emit more or absorb
particular wavelengths of light.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:46.119
So, it's caused by atomic
transitions.

00:42:46.119 --> 00:42:54.648
I won't explain what those are
in detail, but each comes from a

00:42:54.648 --> 00:43:01.804
specific chemical element.
So, hydrogen has particular

00:43:01.804 --> 00:43:07.334
wavelengths associated with it.
Helium has particular

00:43:07.334 --> 00:43:11.639
wavelengths associated with it,
and so on and so forth.

00:43:11.639 --> 00:43:17.833
And this, by the way,
is how you can determine what

00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:24.769
stars are made out of--determine
composition of stars.

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:28.213
But for the present purpose,
the point is that you can go in

00:43:28.213 --> 00:43:30.840
with a bunch of hydrogen in the
laboratory,

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.105
and measure what the
wavelengths of these spectral

00:43:35.105 --> 00:43:38.239
features are if nothing is
moving.

00:43:38.239 --> 00:43:49.750
So--can measure these
wavelengths at rest in a lab.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:52.889
And so you know in advance what
the rest wavelengths of these

00:43:52.889 --> 00:43:54.908
things are.
You go out and measure them in

00:43:54.908 --> 00:43:57.718
stars, and it turns out they're
not quite where they're supposed

00:43:57.718 --> 00:44:00.043
to be.
And that's how you determine

00:44:00.043 --> 00:44:03.479
what the Doppler shift of any
particular object is,

00:44:03.479 --> 00:44:07.326
by comparing these spectral
features to where they are in

00:44:07.326 --> 00:44:08.220
the lab.

00:44:11.519 --> 00:44:19.093
Now, here's--so if we go back
to talking about pulsations,

00:44:19.093 --> 00:44:26.799
so here is--this is kind of a
blow-up of an absorption line

00:44:26.799 --> 00:44:31.057
this case.
So here's intensity,

00:44:31.057 --> 00:44:36.931
and here's wavelength,
and it looks something like

00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:41.018
this.
And so there's a particular set

00:44:41.018 --> 00:44:44.449
of wavelengths that are
absorbed.

00:44:44.449 --> 00:44:48.315
Now, if the whole star moves,
if the star is moving because

00:44:48.315 --> 00:44:52.780
there's a planet around it--what
happens when it gets redshifted?

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:56.044
Well, this whole thing moves to
the right to longer wavelengths,

00:44:56.044 --> 00:44:58.220
and you get something that
looks, you know,

00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.360
sort of like this.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:12.170
So this is--whole star moves
away from you.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:14.619
And so, the whole thing shifts
back and forth.

00:45:14.619 --> 00:45:17.070
But pulsations are a little bit
different.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.030
When you get a redshift due to
pulsation, it's because,

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:28.829
you know, you're looking at
something that does this.

00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:36.424
Part of the star moves away
from you, but part of the star

00:45:36.424 --> 00:45:38.690
moves sideways.

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:46.793
And so, only part of the
emission is redshifted,

00:45:46.793 --> 00:45:50.630
but other parts of the emission
are not.

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:55.155
And so what you do is,
you sort of--it's not like the

00:45:55.155 --> 00:45:59.002
whole thing moves sideways.
It's that it sort of gets

00:45:59.002 --> 00:46:02.157
smushed out.
Because part of the star moves

00:46:02.157 --> 00:46:07.010
sideways, but--part of the
absorption line moves sideways,

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.491
but part of the absorption line
doesn't move because it's

00:46:09.491 --> 00:46:10.478
coming;
you know, it's,

00:46:10.478 --> 00:46:12.595
like, coming from this part of
the star, which is going

00:46:12.595 --> 00:46:15.576
sideways to you.
And so what you do is you get

00:46:15.576 --> 00:46:18.429
something that looks more like
this.

00:46:18.429 --> 00:46:22.310
So this is--part of the star
moves away.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:31.020
So the center of this line has
moved.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:33.656
Here's the center here.
It's gotten even more

00:46:33.656 --> 00:46:36.690
redshifted than in the case I
drew there.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:40.300
But part of it has been left
behind.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:50.826
And so the prediction is that
for pulsations the shape of

00:46:50.826 --> 00:46:59.849
these spectral features
changes--shape of "lines"

00:46:59.849 --> 00:47:07.180
change--whereas for orbital
motion,

00:47:10.639 --> 00:47:16.210
only the position of the lines
change.

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:22.838
So this can be observed.
You can go out and observe,

00:47:22.838 --> 00:47:25.483
and you can see whether the
shape of the lines change or

00:47:25.483 --> 00:47:28.315
not.
And they did that,

00:47:28.315 --> 00:47:35.940
and it's not pulsation,
but is consistent with orbits.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.480
I think this is kind of a cool
experiment.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.950
Because, you know,
this looks a lot like science.

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:46.653
Right?
There's two hypotheses,

00:47:46.653 --> 00:47:49.510
each of which makes a different
prediction.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:52.599
Prediction one--hypothesis one,
it's got to change its shape.

00:47:52.599 --> 00:47:55.119
Hypothesis two,
it does not change its shape.

00:47:55.119 --> 00:47:57.668
You go out, you measure the
thing, and you find out which

00:47:57.668 --> 00:48:00.175
hypothesis is right.
This is just what they told you

00:48:00.175 --> 00:48:02.652
in eighth grade and,
therefore, just what I told you

00:48:02.652 --> 00:48:05.130
a couple of days ago never
happens in astronomy.

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:12.091
But sometimes it does.
And so this is yet another

00:48:12.091 --> 00:48:22.503
fable, "The Disproof of
Pulsation as Explanation for the

00:48:22.503 --> 00:48:28.057
Velocity Curves."
And the moral here is,

00:48:28.057 --> 00:48:31.270
"sometimes science works like
science."

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.551
So there were,
for several years,

00:48:41.551 --> 00:48:46.329
all of these attempts to try
and explain the Hot Jupiter,

00:48:46.329 --> 00:48:50.032
the radial velocity curves,
without actually having to bite

00:48:50.032 --> 00:48:53.159
the bullet and believe that Hot
Jupiters exist.

00:48:53.159 --> 00:48:55.349
None of them were very
convincing.

00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:58.769
This double star hypothesis
didn't seem to work out.

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:01.570
The pulsation hypothesis didn't
seem to work out.

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:04.329
But nevertheless,
people kept trying to come up

00:49:04.329 --> 00:49:08.708
with alternative explanations,
until something happened that

00:49:08.708 --> 00:49:13.710
pretty much nailed down the idea
that these things really,

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:17.320
honest-to-goodness, are planets.
But I don't have time to tell

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.355
you about that now,
so we'll talk about it on

00:49:19.355 --> 00:49:21.000
Thursday.
Okay.

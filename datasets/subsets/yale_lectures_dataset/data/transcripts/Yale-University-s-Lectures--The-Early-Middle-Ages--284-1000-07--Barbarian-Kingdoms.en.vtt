00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.500
PAUL FREEDMAN: So last
time we spoke about the

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.433
collapse of the Roman Empire.

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:11.167
And I didn't quite definitively
answer the

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:17.900
question: External force
- Internal collapse?

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.300
There are other possible
explanations: an eminent

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.100
historian of the barbarian says
that the Roman Empire

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.967
committed suicide by accident.

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:29.000
That essentially it was just
a political problem.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.100
The wrong people became
emperors.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.500
Some bad things happened
and one day there

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.567
it was, it was gone.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:39.900
I'm not sure I buy that; I like
long-term causes more.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.533
But it is important to emphasize
that a lot of this

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:46.000
is contingency and not
inevitability.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.400
Historians generally tend to
make things look as if they

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.033
had to happen.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:56.500
As if there's sort of long-term
things playing out

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.800
inevitably.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.433
And the longer or the farther
away the historian is from the

00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:08.233
period that he or she is
studying, the greater that

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:12.400
tendency because the look
back is longer.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.333
So in talking about both the
Empire and the barbarians, I

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:19.900
want to at least remind you that
events could have gone

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.867
other ways.

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:27.233
There are lots of long-term
tendencies, but we're talking

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:32.600
about a series of factors
that are both

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.667
immediate and long term.

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:38.567
This is relevant to talking
about the barbarians

00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:41.233
and who they are.

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:45.767
Which is more of a mystery
than it might seem.

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:49.567
Who they are as in, what does it
mean to say that someone is

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.467
a Visigoth?

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:55.133
How much have I described
what that means?

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:58.533
And despite the business about
plunder, that's not actually

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:01.333
the only thing they
were after.

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:06.000
As we have tried to emphasize,
they liked the Roman Empire.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.967
They wanted to share in its
advantages, not to destroy it.

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:20.167
We've emphasized accommodation
rather than conquest. We've

00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:22.800
said that this is the
end of a world, not

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.133
the end of the world.

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:30.200
It is the end of a certain
civilization, perhaps, or

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.567
maybe transformation of that
civilization, but it's not the

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:35.600
end of civilization.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.367
They're not invaders
from outer space.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:42.533
Where do they come from?

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:43.367
Who are they?

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:45.900
What are these aspects
of accommodation?

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.467
That's partly what we want to
talk about today in discussing

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:54.867
the barbarian kingdoms after
the collapse of Rome.

00:02:54.867 --> 00:03:01.000
So 476 to 530.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.900
What happens in 530 is that
the Eastern Roman Empire

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.200
embarks on a reconquest
of the West

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.833
under the emperor Justinian.

00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:10.200
And that will be the
subject of our

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.067
discussion a week from today.

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:14.300
Any questions in
the meanwhile?

00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:22.133
Notice that in the Burgundian
Code the authors of the code,

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:24.800
the Burgundians, call themselves
barbarians.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.100
They distinguish between
barbarians and Romans.

00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:35.533
Even though they use the word,
it's deceptive to think of

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:39.333
barbarians, or tribes, or
Germans as if these were

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:44.067
absolute well-defined terms
that corresponded to an

00:03:44.067 --> 00:03:48.933
absolute well-defined
set of realities.

00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:50.833
What do we know about
these people before

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:53.100
they enter the Empire?

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.400
We know something from
archaeology.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.167
But as they moved around, as I
said they're not nomadic, they

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:05.300
have settlements, but they're
not very urban settlements.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.300
They have gravesites.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.133
People who have gravesites with
a lot of graves are not

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:11.933
moving around a lot.

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:14.000
So that's one indication.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.167
And the gravesites sometimes
have stuff in them, things

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:20.100
buried with them.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.800
And among other things, they
show that they had trade with

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.533
the Roman Empire because
they've got Roman

00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:25.867
artifacts in them.

00:04:25.867 --> 00:04:27.433
Well, OK.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:30.500
But we actually don't find
out that much about them.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:38.900
The main written source for
pre-invasion, let's call them

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.433
Germanic tribes delicately, is
Tacitus, the Roman historian

00:04:45.433 --> 00:04:49.033
better known, or best known,
for his very pessimistic

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:50.933
annals of the history
of the Roman Empire.

00:04:56.767 --> 00:05:02.000
But also the author of a brief
work called Germania about the

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.700
German tribes.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.567
For Tacitus, the Germans- that
is the peoples living beyond

00:05:09.567 --> 00:05:16.633
the Rhine frontier- are both
childlike and noble.

00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:17.867
They're warlike.

00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:24.533
From the Roman point of view,
these Barbarians are intent on

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:27.933
invading the Empire and
enjoying its riches.

00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:33.400
Hence the defensive kinds of
frontiers we've talked about.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.300
The Rhine, or in Britain,
Hadrian's Wall, which you can

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.033
still see in the north of
England, not that far from the

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:42.200
Scottish border.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.300
That to guard not against
Germans, but Celts, Picts, and

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.567
Scots, in particular.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.200
Tacitus portrays the Germans
as kind of warlike.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.533
Around the year 100 is
his description.

00:06:01.533 --> 00:06:04.967
But he never visited Germania.

00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:08.033
And if you'd asked him, well, if
you're going to write about

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:11.800
them, shouldn't you do
some field work?

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.067
he'd have looked at you
as if you were crazy.

00:06:16.067 --> 00:06:17.067
Go there?

00:06:17.067 --> 00:06:17.933
Me?

00:06:17.933 --> 00:06:20.000
Moi?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.233
You've got to be kidding.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.000
The reason he wrote the work
was probably not an

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.433
anthropological description of
the Germans, but as a way of

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:33.700
berating the Romans.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.733
If you describe people who are
virtuous but primitive, you

00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:43.833
can use that to castigate
your own people.

00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:47.800
Rousseau's noble savage where
the American Indians are used

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.233
to attack supposedly civilized
societies is an example.

00:06:53.233 --> 00:06:58.667
Or descriptions of the South
Seas, some of Herman

00:06:58.667 --> 00:07:00.600
Melville's earlier works.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.333
Or Robert Louis Stevenson.

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:04.833
Or Gauguin's paintings.

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:12.033
Contrast a beautiful, natural,
simple world far superior to

00:07:12.033 --> 00:07:18.067
the fatiguing rat race of what
passes for civilization.

00:07:18.067 --> 00:07:23.300
So Tacitus' Germans are warlike,
concerned with

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.600
personal bravery and honor.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.633
They have close family ties.

00:07:31.633 --> 00:07:32.867
They're heterosexuals.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.033
They treat their women well.

00:07:38.033 --> 00:07:42.900
All of these are supposed to
contrast with what Tacitus,

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.133
who's a bit of a scold, Tacitus

00:07:45.133 --> 00:07:48.333
sees as Roman decadence.

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:51.000
The Romans are given
to prostitution.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.167
None of that in the German
realms. The Romans are given

00:07:56.167 --> 00:08:00.533
to same sex love.

00:08:00.533 --> 00:08:02.867
Oh, no, no, no.

00:08:02.867 --> 00:08:06.767
The Germans know that
that is really evil.

00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:08.900
They don't practice divorce,
according to Tacitus.

00:08:11.567 --> 00:08:11.767
Now this is not--

00:08:11.767 --> 00:08:17.033
This is a moralistic rather than
an ethnographic treatise.

00:08:17.033 --> 00:08:19.600
He does condemn them
for certain vices.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.267
The vices typically ascribed to
so-called primitive peoples

00:08:24.267 --> 00:08:25.033
by the civilized.

00:08:25.033 --> 00:08:27.233
They're lazy.

00:08:27.233 --> 00:08:29.967
They tend to get drunk.

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:31.833
They quarrel.

00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:33.067
They gamble.

00:08:36.067 --> 00:08:41.333
In several respects Tacitus,
however, describes things that

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:46.267
are true of later German
practices visible in the

00:08:46.267 --> 00:08:48.600
Burgundian Code, for example.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.167
And that he does not
make up for any

00:08:51.167 --> 00:08:54.400
particular moralistic purpose.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.867
Two of these things
are the comitatus.

00:08:59.867 --> 00:09:08.033
The comitatus is the important
men surrounding the leader,

00:09:08.033 --> 00:09:13.133
his entourage, but his military

00:09:13.133 --> 00:09:16.200
entourage, his armed men.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.233
Not just bodyguards, but members
of a gang, I guess

00:09:20.233 --> 00:09:22.433
would be the closest simile.

00:09:22.433 --> 00:09:28.233
People who are loyal to their
superior, but who have a

00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:30.200
certain amount of autonomy.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.700
They're not just sort of paid,
as I said, bodyguards.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.433
They are his followers.

00:09:40.967 --> 00:09:45.133
An anachronistic word would
be "vassals" anachronistic

00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:47.467
because it's not used
at this time.

00:09:47.467 --> 00:09:49.900
His military followers.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.700
Armed military followers,
the comitatus.

00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:58.867
Tacitus describes the feud.

00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:01.533
Feud between clans.

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:04.600
Feuds are generally
characteristic of societies

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.700
without a strong central
government and with fairly

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.700
generous definitions
of kinship.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.000
A generous definition of kinship
means you know who

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.033
your second cousin is, maybe
your third cousin, maybe your

00:10:18.033 --> 00:10:20.033
third cousin twice removed.

00:10:20.033 --> 00:10:24.867
And that cousin is going to
consider your interests to be

00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:28.267
his or her interests as well.

00:10:28.267 --> 00:10:35.100
You might expect your children
or parents to support you, but

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:42.833
you probably don't expect your
great uncles or second cousins

00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:45.333
to do much for you.

00:10:45.333 --> 00:10:51.700
So in terms of vengeance, which
is also protection, in

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.267
other words, I am protected by
the fact that if somebody

00:10:54.267 --> 00:10:58.933
kills me, my clan will take
vengeance on their clan.

00:10:58.933 --> 00:11:03.767
In terms of protection and
vengeance, extended kinship is

00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:09.500
related to a feud and to keeping
order in a society

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.433
that doesn't have a very
powerful central government.

00:11:14.433 --> 00:11:20.633
One way of avoiding feuds that
killed too many people is

00:11:20.633 --> 00:11:21.800
compensation.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.200
And this compensation is
mentioned by Tacitus and is

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.833
what appears in the Burgundian
Code and elsewhere as wergeld.

00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:34.233
Wergeld is the money paid in
compensation for hurting or

00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:35.500
killing someone.

00:11:39.467 --> 00:11:41.600
I killed your brother.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.500
We have a drunken brawl.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.800
I don't like the way he
describes my mother.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.433
And I kill him.

00:11:49.433 --> 00:11:53.900
I'm sorry, but that's just
the way things go.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.433
What are you going
to do about it?

00:11:56.433 --> 00:11:58.867
Are you going to kill me?

00:11:58.867 --> 00:12:02.767
Are you going to kill
a cousin of mine?

00:12:02.767 --> 00:12:08.133
Or maybe you'll accept
compensation based on, say,

00:12:08.133 --> 00:12:09.533
what kind of guy he was.

00:12:09.533 --> 00:12:10.500
Was he a silversmith?

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.667
In which case I'm going
to have to pay a

00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:14.767
huge amount of money.

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:15.867
Or was he just some guy?

00:12:15.867 --> 00:12:18.100
Some random guy, random
Burgundian?

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.033
Or free Burgundian?

00:12:20.033 --> 00:12:23.900
Or freed, formerly slave?

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.600
All of these are tariffs.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.600
They're sliding scales
of compensation.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.133
Tacitus mentions this.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.500
So we're looking at the
Burgundian Code, and there are

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.100
other barbarian law codes, for
clues as to how the society

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:43.633
functioned.

00:12:43.633 --> 00:12:46.233
But of course, it's a society
that's already

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:47.767
in the Roman Empire.

00:12:50.733 --> 00:12:53.633
It looks like before they
entered the empire, they lived

00:12:53.633 --> 00:12:55.233
in little villages.

00:12:55.233 --> 00:13:00.633
They cultivated grain, but they
were more cattle-raisers.

00:13:00.633 --> 00:13:03.567
They're skilled at
iron working.

00:13:03.567 --> 00:13:08.133
They also supplemented their
income by a spot of raiding

00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:10.167
and warfare.

00:13:10.167 --> 00:13:13.167
Opportunistic warfare.

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.100
Ties of kinship are
very important.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.800
When we're talking about a clan,
extended kinship group,

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.667
we're talking about maybe
50 households.

00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:25.800
And we'll see this again.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.167
We'll see this with
the Bedouins in

00:13:27.167 --> 00:13:30.033
the desert, for example.

00:13:30.033 --> 00:13:34.100
Within the clan you're
not supposed to feud.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.533
Not supposed to.

00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:39.533
Above the clan level
is some kind of

00:13:39.533 --> 00:13:43.900
confederation or tribe.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.333
And this is where things get
kind of difficult, because we

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:52.833
don't really know how one clan
considered another clan to be

00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:55.000
part of something larger.

00:13:57.667 --> 00:14:00.333
That is, we know that the Romans
call the people who

00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:03.833
defeated them at Adrianople
the Visigoths.

00:14:03.833 --> 00:14:04.867
"Oh, my gosh.

00:14:04.867 --> 00:14:05.733
Here I am.

00:14:05.733 --> 00:14:06.567
Adrianople.

00:14:06.567 --> 00:14:07.800
The Visigoths are winning.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.500
What am I going to do?"

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.633
But who are the Visigoths?

00:14:12.633 --> 00:14:16.700
One theory is that they're just
groups of people who come

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.500
together in contact with the
Roman Empire, in part because

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.967
the Roman Empire calls
them something.

00:14:22.967 --> 00:14:26.600
It gives them a name and
they develop what's

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.133
called fictive kinship.

00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:30.967
From a common ancestor.

00:14:30.967 --> 00:14:36.000
They invent the notion that they
all come from one place

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.900
and one ancestor.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:44.200
This process of sort of
fictitious ethnic invention is

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.733
called "ethnogenesis."
Ethnogenesis means the birth

00:14:49.733 --> 00:14:52.233
of an ethnicity.

00:14:52.233 --> 00:14:55.667
Rather than some kind of
biological fact that you could

00:14:55.667 --> 00:14:58.900
confirm with DNA, e.g.--

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:04.300
all Visigoths have some sort of
biological thing in common.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.433
These people are not really
related, but they invent a

00:15:07.433 --> 00:15:08.667
common ancestor.

00:15:12.967 --> 00:15:24.467
And this question of who forms
a real group remains both

00:15:24.467 --> 00:15:26.400
important as a real thing.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.233
For example, American
Indian tribes.

00:15:30.233 --> 00:15:34.300
There are some whose claims to
existence are indisputable.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.000
They have treaties with
the United States.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.167
They've had reservations
for many years.

00:15:39.167 --> 00:15:45.533
But now with the inducements
for tribes, the tax free

00:15:45.533 --> 00:15:48.200
status, the ability to have
casinos and things like that,

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.633
there are petitions for tribes
to be recognized as such.

00:15:52.633 --> 00:15:55.133
And here the question
of ethnicity.

00:15:55.133 --> 00:15:59.800
Ethnic identification becomes
extremely important.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:05.033
A more sinister and much more
widespread modern aspect of

00:16:05.033 --> 00:16:09.600
ethnogenesis is precisely the
use of the Germanic barbarians

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.967
as the origins of the Germans.

00:16:12.967 --> 00:16:17.433
It's no accident that in the
late nineteenth and early

00:16:17.433 --> 00:16:21.567
twentieth century, culminating
but not limited to the Nazis,

00:16:21.567 --> 00:16:27.033
the idea of the Germans as a
racial group; as a group with

00:16:27.033 --> 00:16:37.800
a common Aryan- with a "y"-
ancestry; As manly and as pure

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.533
in the sense that Tacitus
portrays them becomes a

00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:44.867
polemical idea.

00:16:44.867 --> 00:16:47.467
A fighting idea.

00:16:47.467 --> 00:16:50.833
An invented idea
of great force.

00:16:50.833 --> 00:16:54.567
Just because something is false,
it does not necessarily

00:16:54.567 --> 00:16:56.133
lack historical importance.

00:16:59.233 --> 00:17:03.200
So the idea of ethnogenesis,
of the invention of a group

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.600
called the "Visigoths",
is one way of

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.300
approaching who they are.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.267
On the other hand, there's not
a whole lot of evidence that

00:17:11.267 --> 00:17:12.133
they're doing this.

00:17:12.133 --> 00:17:14.600
There's not a whole lot of
evidence that they are

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.533
developing this notion
of a common ancestor.

00:17:17.533 --> 00:17:18.933
Much of the evidence,
or seeming

00:17:18.933 --> 00:17:22.467
evidence, for that is Roman.

00:17:22.467 --> 00:17:25.300
A lot of this ethnogenesis
comes from

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.767
contact with the Romans.

00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:33.900
Certainly peoples who come in
contact with those who are

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.633
more civilized than they are,
and by civilized I mean

00:17:38.633 --> 00:17:42.467
peoples who have writing, who
live in cities, who have

00:17:42.467 --> 00:17:45.633
extensive trade and
administration.

00:17:45.633 --> 00:17:49.033
The so-called barbarian peoples
are going to want to

00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:52.067
define themselves against
the Romans.

00:17:52.067 --> 00:17:56.733
Hence, among other things, many
of these invaders are

00:17:56.733 --> 00:18:03.200
Arian, with an "i." They use
religious difference as part

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.533
of their identity.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:17.600
So they have come into the
empire and, as we said last

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.133
time, they come into the empire
first as allied troops,

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:23.967
as refugees, as federati.

00:18:23.967 --> 00:18:29.867
Federati, that is to say armies
of the Roman Empire.

00:18:29.867 --> 00:18:35.500
They are supported by a system
with the bland name of

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.033
hospitality.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:43.933
Hospitality meaning that they're
settled on the land of

00:18:43.933 --> 00:18:47.700
Romans and they share in the
revenue of that land.

00:18:50.433 --> 00:18:52.133
That's how the Romans
pay them.

00:18:52.133 --> 00:18:53.833
They don't pay them cash.

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:56.033
They don't pay them
in plunder.

00:18:56.033 --> 00:18:59.367
They pay them in a portion
of the tax revenue.

00:18:59.367 --> 00:19:03.700
So you owe a reasonably
powerful but not quite

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.633
powerful enough senator
in Burgandy.

00:19:07.633 --> 00:19:12.167
You settle some friendly
Burgundian

00:19:12.167 --> 00:19:14.333
troops on your land.

00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:20.167
And you give them hospitality,
that is to say one third of

00:19:20.167 --> 00:19:22.967
the tax revenue that you're
collecting for the empire.

00:19:22.967 --> 00:19:24.667
Or maybe one third of just your

00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:28.767
regular old private revenues.

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:31.467
This is a kind of accommodation
then.

00:19:31.467 --> 00:19:38.233
It's accommodation that costs
money, but it is part of a set

00:19:38.233 --> 00:19:43.200
of ways that the Roman elite
figures out how to deal with

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.900
these invaders.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.033
Collaborate with them.

00:19:49.033 --> 00:19:52.700
So the Roman aristocratic land
owners and the barbarian war

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.300
leaders come to various kinds
of accommodation.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.967
Now, the accommodation differs
depending on where we're

00:19:59.967 --> 00:20:00.600
speaking of.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.400
And now we come to the point
of having to describe the

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.200
barbarian kingdoms.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.300
I've given you two maps, one
of which you're not to show

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.567
people who are not
in the class.

00:20:14.567 --> 00:20:15.233
This one.

00:20:15.233 --> 00:20:17.300
The one with the arrows.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:21.633
Yale University is home to one
of the great historians of our

00:20:21.633 --> 00:20:24.133
time, Walter Goffart.

00:20:24.133 --> 00:20:26.600
And I can't believe that I'm
talking about all sorts of

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.400
people like Wickham and Goffart
in something that's

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:34.933
going to be widely available,
but, anyway let me express my

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:40.233
admiration to him, great early
Medieval historian who could

00:20:40.233 --> 00:20:42.133
certainly run rings around me.

00:20:42.133 --> 00:20:43.467
He's retired.

00:20:43.467 --> 00:20:45.600
He taught at the University
of Toronto.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.800
And among his many works is one
that completely destroys

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.633
the notion of having invaders
with arrows.

00:20:52.633 --> 00:20:56.800
This whole idea, like they've
got this path; we know where

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.133
they are; they come
from somewhere.

00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:03.867
See up where what is now
southern Sweden, Skandia?

00:21:03.867 --> 00:21:06.433
A lot of these histories, or
what purport to be histories,

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:08.267
say they came from Skandia.

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:12.800
And you can still read in not
very old textbooks, oh, the

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.367
Visigoths came from Skandia.

00:21:14.367 --> 00:21:16.367
And then they went here, and
then they went there, and

00:21:16.367 --> 00:21:18.467
they're migrating all round.

00:21:18.467 --> 00:21:21.567
And you have little arrows
that show their progress.

00:21:21.567 --> 00:21:23.167
You're not supposed
to do that.

00:21:23.167 --> 00:21:25.200
I'm not sure what you're
supposed to do though, as a

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.100
substitute.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.500
And as always with historically
misleading

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.433
things, once you get rid of the
misleading thing, you're

00:21:31.433 --> 00:21:35.200
kind of helpless if you're
trying to teach this.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.633
So I'm asking you to look at
this really closely and not

00:21:37.633 --> 00:21:38.800
take it seriously.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.100
I'm asking you to memorize
everywhere they went, but not

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.067
to tell anybody.

00:21:44.067 --> 00:21:46.567
Once they enter the Empire then
those arrows start to

00:21:46.567 --> 00:21:47.300
make sense.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:51.167
We know that the Visigoths were
in the Balkans at the

00:21:51.167 --> 00:21:52.767
time of the battle of
Adrianople in 278.

00:21:52.767 --> 00:21:53.467
[correction: 378]

00:21:53.467 --> 00:21:55.733
We know that they sacked
Rome in 410.

00:21:55.733 --> 00:21:58.233
We know that they go down to
Italy to try to get to the

00:21:58.233 --> 00:21:59.667
granaries of North Africa.

00:21:59.667 --> 00:22:03.200
We know they discover, "OMG, I
can't build a boat," so then

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.833
they come up the other
side of Italy.

00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:08.500
They settle in southern
France.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.667
They're kicked out of southern
France by the Franks

00:22:10.667 --> 00:22:11.567
for the most part.

00:22:11.567 --> 00:22:15.233
And they settle in Spain, where
the Arabs get them.

00:22:15.233 --> 00:22:19.067
Four weeks from now, I think.

00:22:19.067 --> 00:22:21.600
So the arrows are not completely
deceptive, and

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.300
that's why I've given
these to you.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.433
And it's hard to tell which
arrows apply to which tribes,

00:22:29.433 --> 00:22:32.467
so hence map two.

00:22:32.467 --> 00:22:35.067
Map two, a lot calmer.

00:22:35.067 --> 00:22:37.000
This is the situation in 506.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.267
Why 506?

00:22:38.267 --> 00:22:41.200
Because in that year the Franks,
whom we're going to be

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:48.000
following more closely, the
Merovingian Franks defeat the

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.033
Visigoths and start pushing them
out of southern France.

00:22:53.033 --> 00:22:56.233
So this is a map, I guess,
before that defeat.

00:22:56.233 --> 00:22:59.500
You see the Visigoths in
southern France and

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.033
northeastern Spain with
the Basques kind

00:23:03.033 --> 00:23:04.300
of in between them.

00:23:07.967 --> 00:23:12.100
So this is the situation
in 500.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.900
There's no more Roman Empire
of the West. Or there is a

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.600
fictitious Roman Empire of the
West. All of these people to

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.900
varying degrees--

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:26.400
well, not all of them, most of
them-- acknowledge some kind

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.867
of suzerainty of
Constantinople.

00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:35.867
You'll read about Clovis, King
of the Franks in the beginning

00:23:35.867 --> 00:23:40.833
of the 6th century, who gets
some sort of gift from the

00:23:40.833 --> 00:23:42.733
emperor Anastasius in
Constantinople.

00:23:45.267 --> 00:23:51.233
A letter of appointment, some
robes, various trinkets, and,

00:23:51.233 --> 00:23:54.600
according to Gregory of Tours,
the historian of Clovis, the

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.633
title of consul And he is
very pleased with this.

00:23:59.633 --> 00:24:01.133
He dons these robes.

00:24:01.133 --> 00:24:06.467
He scatters coins just like
a newly appointed emperor.

00:24:06.467 --> 00:24:08.867
But is he obeying the
emperor Anastasius?

00:24:08.867 --> 00:24:12.033
Did the emperor Anastasius start
sending orders to him?

00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:14.267
Or have any kind of
administration?

00:24:14.267 --> 00:24:15.467
No.

00:24:15.467 --> 00:24:19.133
This is really just symbolic.

00:24:19.133 --> 00:24:21.667
We will talk about the
relationship between the

00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:24.767
Eastern empire and the
barbarians, because it's going

00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:28.467
to change in the sixth century
as the Eastern empire fends

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:32.500
off its opponents and becomes
more concerned to take back as

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.233
much as possible of the
lost Western empire.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.300
In the year 500, the most
impressive of these barbarians

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.700
would've been the Ostrogoths
because they are occupying

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:53.733
Italy, which is the most Roman,
the most prosperous,

00:24:53.733 --> 00:25:04.433
the most intact economically and
culturally of the former

00:25:04.433 --> 00:25:08.500
Roman Empire of the West.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.967
The Ostrogoths had
been in the--

00:25:12.967 --> 00:25:15.100
if you look at the arrows, they
had been maybe in the

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.867
Crimean area, around
the Black Sea.

00:25:17.867 --> 00:25:19.500
They came into the Balkans.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:24.033
They tried to attack
Constantinople in the late

00:25:24.033 --> 00:25:30.033
fifth century, and they
were defeated.

00:25:30.033 --> 00:25:33.500
And they were encouraged to
move into Italy by the

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:38.233
Byzantine emperor to get rid
of Odoacer, that military

00:25:38.233 --> 00:25:42.333
leader whose takeover of Italy
in 476 is conventionally

00:25:42.333 --> 00:25:50.333
understood to be the end of the
Roman Empire in the West.

00:25:50.333 --> 00:25:51.733
The Ostrogoths had an

00:25:51.733 --> 00:25:53.100
impressive ruler named
Theodoric.

00:25:58.767 --> 00:26:07.400
And they ruled from Ravenna, the
old last Roman capital in

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.133
northeastern Italy.

00:26:09.133 --> 00:26:12.700
And the tomb of Theodoric can
still be seen in Ravenna.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.467
Very impressive monument.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.167
Roman education survived
in Italy.

00:26:23.167 --> 00:26:29.900
It would reach its last
flowering with two figures: I

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:35.600
mentioned one of them last
time, Boethius and

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.833
Cassiodorus.

00:26:41.033 --> 00:26:43.533
These are two key figures
in the preservation

00:26:43.533 --> 00:26:45.533
of classical learning.

00:26:45.533 --> 00:26:51.633
Boethuis, not perhaps literally
the last person in

00:26:51.633 --> 00:26:57.900
the west who knew Greek, but
certainly the last person who

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:02.467
tried to make Greek knowledge
known to people who could only

00:27:02.467 --> 00:27:04.100
read in Latin.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.267
He conceived the project of
translating all of Plato and

00:27:07.267 --> 00:27:11.200
Aristotle into Latin.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.333
He started by doing a kind
of introductory textbook.

00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:19.867
Like a lot of great projects,
this one was not completed.

00:27:19.867 --> 00:27:23.200
In fact, this one barely got off
the ground because he was

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.733
accused by Theodoric of
conspiring with the Byzantine

00:27:28.733 --> 00:27:32.400
Empire, the Eastern Roman
Empire, to overthrow him.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.967
He was imprisoned for a year.

00:27:34.967 --> 00:27:38.867
In prison he wrote one of the
most magnificent works of

00:27:38.867 --> 00:27:46.867
philosophy, of why we are
alive and why we die.

00:27:46.867 --> 00:27:48.600
The Consolation of Philosophy.

00:27:52.733 --> 00:27:55.467
And then he was executed.

00:27:55.467 --> 00:27:59.833
Cassiodorus lived
to be ninety.

00:27:59.833 --> 00:28:03.433
So one of the differences
between these two figures of

00:28:03.433 --> 00:28:07.600
the last gasp of Roman culture
in Italy is Cassiodorus's

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.733
relative longevity.

00:28:09.733 --> 00:28:12.000
They're both figures of
the sixth century.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.133
Boethius dies in the 530s,
Cassiodorus much, much later.

00:28:16.133 --> 00:28:21.267
Cassiodorus also conceives of a
program of education, but it

00:28:21.267 --> 00:28:25.833
is more oriented towards
Latin learning.

00:28:25.833 --> 00:28:29.733
And Cassiodorus in some way is
the founder, or at least the

00:28:29.733 --> 00:28:34.000
transmitter to us, of the idea
of the liberal arts.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.467
Cassiodorus is a religious
figure.

00:28:36.467 --> 00:28:39.133
Boethius is a Christian and he
wrote on Christian topics, but

00:28:39.133 --> 00:28:42.967
The Consolation of Philosophy,
interestingly enough, is a

00:28:42.967 --> 00:28:48.867
stoical work, has very little
explicitly about Christianity.

00:28:48.867 --> 00:28:52.433
Cassiodorus, on the other hand,
is the guy who invented

00:28:52.433 --> 00:28:55.833
the idea that monks should
copy manuscripts.

00:28:55.833 --> 00:29:01.167
That the preserve of culture,
the place where it seeks

00:29:01.167 --> 00:29:05.900
refuge and is protected in
barbarian times, should be

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.967
monasteries.

00:29:06.967 --> 00:29:08.767
This seems so self-evident
to us.

00:29:08.767 --> 00:29:11.067
Because if there's one thing
we know about monasteries,

00:29:11.067 --> 00:29:15.533
it's guys hunched over and
writing stuff and the

00:29:15.533 --> 00:29:16.600
preservation of learning.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:20.533
But, in fact, monasteries
start out as just

00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:25.267
anti-intellectual institutions
where you pray and you don't

00:29:25.267 --> 00:29:27.100
spend a lot of time
reading, let alone

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.433
copying, let alone thinking.

00:29:29.433 --> 00:29:30.600
You're supposed to
have visions.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.500
You're supposed to
be inspired.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.300
You're supposed to fast
and become ecstatic.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.233
It's Cassiodorus who conceives
of this as a contemplative and

00:29:40.233 --> 00:29:41.600
learned project.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:49.367
The liberal arts means here
things that are not

00:29:49.367 --> 00:29:52.700
immediately practically
useful, but that help

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:58.167
illuminate the person seeking
after knowledge.

00:29:58.167 --> 00:30:00.733
And what kind of knowledge is a
person seeking after in the

00:30:00.733 --> 00:30:03.467
6th century A.D.?

00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:06.700
They're seeking after knowledge
of God and knowledge

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.600
of the divine.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.000
Why not just read the Bible?

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.367
I'm sure many of you have read
the Bible or read parts of it.

00:30:17.367 --> 00:30:21.833
The Bible is not an immediately
evident document

00:30:21.833 --> 00:30:27.233
in terms of its view of the
world is total, but it's full

00:30:27.233 --> 00:30:28.000
of mysteries.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.833
It's full of obscurities.

00:30:30.833 --> 00:30:34.033
It's a strange work that
requires knowledge and

00:30:34.033 --> 00:30:35.967
explication.

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:39.433
Or to celebrate divine services,
for example,

00:30:39.433 --> 00:30:41.600
requires a certain kind
of knowledge.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.000
To know when Easter is.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.767
To know the phases
of the moon.

00:30:44.767 --> 00:30:47.100
To know what day it is.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.300
These monks, or just anybody out
in the countryside, can't

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:56.833
just look at their phone and
see what time it is.

00:30:56.833 --> 00:31:01.100
There's a need for some
practical knowledge, but that

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.667
involves abstract concepts
like the

00:31:02.667 --> 00:31:03.733
movements of the planets.

00:31:03.733 --> 00:31:07.500
This is what the liberal arts
are and this is what's being

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.400
preserved in the Ostrogothic
kingdom.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.433
But the fate of Boethius shows
you the sort of duality of the

00:31:14.433 --> 00:31:16.600
barbarian patronage
of culture.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.667
On the one hand, the Ostrogoths
in Italy are as

00:31:19.667 --> 00:31:22.300
civilized as these groups get.

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.100
On the other hand, of course,
Boethius is executed.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.200
On the third hand, you didn't
have to be a barbarian to

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.900
execute people.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.433
After all, Seneca was forced
to commit suicide by Nero.

00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:38.067
So the fate of intellectuals
in the Roman Empire is not

00:31:38.067 --> 00:31:41.100
necessarily so much better than
the fate of intellectuals

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:42.667
in the barbarian kingdoms.

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:44.767
The thing about the
intellectuals in the barbarian

00:31:44.767 --> 00:31:47.967
kingdoms is they're
very few of them.

00:31:47.967 --> 00:31:48.967
Seneca's a great man.

00:31:48.967 --> 00:31:50.700
It's too bad that he died.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.900
We could have had more works.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.867
But there were lots of
other philosophers.

00:31:53.867 --> 00:31:55.133
There were lots of other
playwrights.

00:31:59.833 --> 00:31:59.933
Boethuis we can say--

00:31:59.933 --> 00:32:02.800
Boethius and Cassiodorus, maybe,
are the two smartest

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:09.000
people in the sixth century,
judging by what they had

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.333
access to, what they read,
how they wrote.

00:32:12.333 --> 00:32:14.500
And that is scary.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.000
If you can say that Isidore of
Seville is the smartest man of

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.800
the seventh century.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.667
Or Bede and Alcuin are
the smartest men

00:32:22.667 --> 00:32:26.100
of the eighth century.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.900
It's not just a compliment
to them.

00:32:33.567 --> 00:32:36.967
If you're rated like the
eighteenth best tennis player

00:32:36.967 --> 00:32:39.767
in the United States, that's a
tremendous accomplishment.

00:32:39.767 --> 00:32:43.433
But presumably, there are 200
tennis players who are ranked.

00:32:43.433 --> 00:32:45.600
And behind them there
are 10,000

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.500
very good tennis players.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.000
But what if you were the number
one tennis player in

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.400
the country, and there
was no number four?

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.333
No number four through
one hundred million.

00:32:57.333 --> 00:33:00.300
Tennis would be an
endangered game.

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.000
It would mean a lot, but
supposing nobody followed

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.233
tennis anymore?

00:33:08.033 --> 00:33:12.033
I don't know enough about
antiquated games, but some

00:33:12.033 --> 00:33:15.600
medieval game that only five
people know how to play.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.967
I could be the fourth ranked.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.167
But here we're not talking
about sports,

00:33:24.167 --> 00:33:25.167
important though they are.

00:33:25.167 --> 00:33:26.500
We're talking about the

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.867
fundamental aspects of
knowledge.

00:33:30.867 --> 00:33:31.333
Theodoric.

00:33:31.333 --> 00:33:34.133
Theodoric is a great ruler, but
he had a problem that is

00:33:34.133 --> 00:33:37.233
typical of many of these
barbarian groups: He had to

00:33:37.233 --> 00:33:41.033
hold his minority together.

00:33:41.033 --> 00:33:45.600
The thing that made Italy
the wealthiest, the most

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.867
important, the biggest prize
for the barbarians, is its

00:33:48.867 --> 00:33:52.367
Roman population, its Roman
wealth, the preservation of

00:33:52.367 --> 00:33:53.500
its cities.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.100
But that also meant that the
Ostrogoths were a tiny

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.400
proportion of the total
population.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.233
He needs to hold them together,
but he also needs to

00:34:02.233 --> 00:34:03.800
mollify the Romans.

00:34:09.167 --> 00:34:11.300
So it's a dangerous place
for barbarian rulers.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.567
Odoacer had already
been overthrown.

00:34:14.567 --> 00:34:16.800
It's too valuable to
the Eastern Empire.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:22.900
And indeed after Theodoric
died in 535, very shortly

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.600
thereafter the Byzantine Empire,
the Eastern Roman

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.800
Empire, would invade Italy and
devastate it in the course of

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.933
conquering it in a twenty
years' war.

00:34:33.933 --> 00:34:36.267
Now if you look at the map
again and turn to North

00:34:36.267 --> 00:34:40.700
Africa, you'll see we've got
the Vandals in what's now

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.000
Tunisia and eastern Algeria.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.467
And then Moorish kingdom
and Roman Empire.

00:34:48.467 --> 00:34:49.633
Ignore Roman Empire.

00:34:49.633 --> 00:34:52.700
I don't know what they're
talking about.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.933
Moorish kingdoms, what
does that mean?

00:34:56.933 --> 00:35:00.933
We don't really know who these
people are either.

00:35:00.933 --> 00:35:01.833
They're not invaders.

00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:04.267
They're desert peoples who have
now taken over what was

00:35:04.267 --> 00:35:07.433
formerly the Roman Empire, and
they're pressing the Vandals.

00:35:07.433 --> 00:35:12.500
The Vandals were less
accommodating than the

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.767
Ostrogoths.

00:35:16.733 --> 00:35:21.500
They were more fiercely Arian.

00:35:24.967 --> 00:35:28.633
They persecuted the elite
of the Roman population,

00:35:28.633 --> 00:35:30.500
including the Roman bishops.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.467
But they were very
effective rulers.

00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:37.433
They had a navy.

00:35:37.433 --> 00:35:39.267
They were able to plunder
Rome several

00:35:39.267 --> 00:35:40.733
times in the 5th century.

00:35:46.333 --> 00:35:50.500
But they were beleaguered by
these Moorish groups, in other

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.133
words native peoples of the
North African desert.

00:35:54.133 --> 00:35:59.033
And so by 506, their
kingdom has shrunk.

00:35:59.033 --> 00:36:02.700
They were also a minority in
what had been a very populous

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.500
part of the Roman Empire.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:09.833
And they tended to fight
among each other.

00:36:09.833 --> 00:36:11.500
They had internecine feuds.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.033
And so we're talking about
things that are common to many

00:36:14.033 --> 00:36:18.200
of these barbarian kingdoms.
Disorganization.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.400
Internal fighting.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.233
Alien religious beliefs,
particularly the Arian heresy.

00:36:26.733 --> 00:36:30.133
And once they've done the
plundering, inability really

00:36:30.133 --> 00:36:33.767
to start making the economy
work very effectively.

00:36:33.767 --> 00:36:36.867
The Vandals would be driven
out of North Africa, or

00:36:36.867 --> 00:36:42.033
obliterated actually, by the
Eastern Roman Empire, in the

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:49.533
late 520s, early 530s.

00:36:49.533 --> 00:36:51.433
Now I'm not going to go through
every one of these,

00:36:51.433 --> 00:36:54.933
but I want to give you some
examples of accommodation.

00:36:54.933 --> 00:36:57.400
Go up to the British Isles.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.367
You'll see it says British
kingdoms, that means Celtic

00:37:00.367 --> 00:37:07.100
kingdoms whose remnants would
later be Wales, Scotland.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.767
And then the Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms. The Anglo-Saxons are

00:37:10.767 --> 00:37:13.133
invaders who come from
the continent

00:37:13.133 --> 00:37:15.433
beginning in the 440s.

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:19.867
This is the first place
that Rome abandons.

00:37:19.867 --> 00:37:24.067
Here it looks more like a
conventional invasion.

00:37:24.067 --> 00:37:27.567
The invaders come and the Romans
pull back their troops

00:37:27.567 --> 00:37:31.467
because they're afraid that Gaul
is going to fall next.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:41.100
And this is an island where the
Roman impress, the Roman

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.267
impact, was less.

00:37:43.267 --> 00:37:46.033
There isn't a large Roman
majority and a

00:37:46.033 --> 00:37:49.800
small German minority.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:56.600
There is a Celtic majority that
blends with the invaders

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.433
or that seeks refuge in these
independent British kingdoms,

00:38:00.433 --> 00:38:03.233
as they're called on the
map, to the west.

00:38:03.233 --> 00:38:05.967
We don't know very much about
what's going on in Britain at

00:38:05.967 --> 00:38:10.500
this time because more than
Vandal North Africa, more than

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:17.000
Ostrogothic Italy, the
past is obliterated.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.700
There's very little Latin
being written.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:23.500
We have very little knowledge
of what is going on.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:28.267
So this is at one extreme
of what might be called

00:38:28.267 --> 00:38:32.000
Barbarization verses
Roman permanence.

00:38:35.967 --> 00:38:40.967
We're going to be talking about
the Franks later and

00:38:40.967 --> 00:38:42.900
we're going to talk a little bit
about the Burgundians in

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:43.967
closing today.

00:38:43.967 --> 00:38:45.167
But this leaves really
among the

00:38:45.167 --> 00:38:48.133
important groups the Visigoths.

00:38:48.133 --> 00:38:51.400
The Visigoths, the people who
in a way started this with

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:56.633
their invasions of the Balkans
in the late 4th century.

00:38:56.633 --> 00:39:00.467
In 506 they control much of
France, the south and the west

00:39:00.467 --> 00:39:03.767
particularly, and are trickling
into Spain.

00:39:03.767 --> 00:39:07.733
We will be following, in reading
Gregory of Tours, the

00:39:07.733 --> 00:39:14.167
tremendous success of the Franks
against the Visigoths.

00:39:14.167 --> 00:39:17.367
And so the Visigoths
will be pushed out.

00:39:17.367 --> 00:39:18.600
What about the Burgundians?

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.633
You've read the Burgundian
Code--

00:39:23.633 --> 00:39:24.967
anything strike you about it?

00:39:28.367 --> 00:39:28.767
Spencer?

00:39:28.767 --> 00:39:32.267
Spencer: Mainly it focused on
differences between different

00:39:32.267 --> 00:39:35.600
classes and emphasized the free
men versus the slaves.

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.733
Burgundians versus Romans,
et cetera.

00:39:37.733 --> 00:39:39.700
PROFESSOR: Very status oriented.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.400
STUDENT: I didn't realize
there was

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.600
so much hair pulling.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.967
PROFESSOR: Yeah, why?

00:39:43.967 --> 00:39:45.667
What's that all about?

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.000
Yeah?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.233
STUDENT: Well, it talked about
the-- in the book it talked

00:39:55.233 --> 00:39:57.167
about how long hair became
like a status symbol.

00:39:57.167 --> 00:39:57.967
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:39:57.967 --> 00:40:02.733
So the question was, what is
all this hair pulling?

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:04.667
It's a status symbol.

00:40:04.667 --> 00:40:08.767
We'll see that the Merovingian
kings wear long hair,

00:40:08.767 --> 00:40:10.567
specially long hair.

00:40:10.567 --> 00:40:14.567
And when they're finally deposed
by the Carolingians,

00:40:14.567 --> 00:40:15.967
that hair is cut.

00:40:15.967 --> 00:40:18.633
Now of course, all their hair
is cut, they're put in

00:40:18.633 --> 00:40:19.900
monasteries.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:24.333
And monks are what's called
"tonsured." If they're not

00:40:24.333 --> 00:40:27.000
completely bald, they at
least are pretty near.

00:40:30.767 --> 00:40:34.033
Like many barbarian, so-called
barbarian, people, or like

00:40:34.033 --> 00:40:35.967
many people period, they're
certain signs

00:40:35.967 --> 00:40:37.700
of prestige, symbols.

00:40:42.333 --> 00:40:47.533
The Burgundian Code is drawn
up between 483 and 532.

00:40:47.533 --> 00:40:49.300
It's drawn up in different
stages.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:53.033
The Burgundians were closer
to [correction: "than"]

00:40:53.033 --> 00:40:56.033
the Ostrogoths in degree
of Romanization.

00:40:56.033 --> 00:40:59.067
They're a group that wants to be
Roman, or at least accepted

00:40:59.067 --> 00:41:00.633
by the Romans.

00:41:00.633 --> 00:41:05.433
They write their own law code in
Latin, like the Visigoths,

00:41:05.433 --> 00:41:06.700
for example.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:14.267
They also write a sort of law
code for the Roman population.

00:41:17.333 --> 00:41:21.300
This law code is aware of
disputes between Romans and

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:21.833
Burgundians.

00:41:21.833 --> 00:41:24.667
And if each has a different kind
of law, then how do you

00:41:24.667 --> 00:41:30.733
settle a problem that arises
between members of both

00:41:30.733 --> 00:41:33.433
communities?

00:41:33.433 --> 00:41:35.767
The Burgundian law
in itself shows a

00:41:35.767 --> 00:41:37.000
lot of Roman influence.

00:41:39.933 --> 00:41:46.667
For example, in chapter eighteen
you've seen this

00:41:46.667 --> 00:41:51.600
title "Of things that happen by
chance" and probably didn't

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.600
seem very dramatic.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.433
If any animal by chance or any
dog by bite causes death to a

00:41:58.433 --> 00:42:01.600
man, we order that among
Burgundians the ancient rule

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.100
of blame be removed
henceforth.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.933
This is an interesting
question.

00:42:06.933 --> 00:42:11.233
If my dog bites you and you
die, am I responsible?

00:42:15.167 --> 00:42:17.733
Is your brother going
to have to kill me?

00:42:17.733 --> 00:42:21.300
That's what the Burgundian
tradition would have been.

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:29.300
But here they say if it's an
accident, then your brother

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.567
can't kill me.

00:42:36.133 --> 00:42:37.133
This is the difference between
-- this is a tricky problem.

00:42:37.133 --> 00:42:39.833
Those of you who have the good
fortune to go to law school

00:42:39.833 --> 00:42:43.100
are going to study this
first year: torts.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.367
A tort is a so-called civil
wrong as opposed to a crime.

00:42:47.367 --> 00:42:50.233
A crime is where I kill
you because I want to.

00:42:50.233 --> 00:42:58.300
A tort is I leave a roller skate
out on the sidewalk, you

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.767
trip and die.

00:43:00.767 --> 00:43:07.167
I'm not going to be considered
in the same league as someone

00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:10.900
who poisoned you, but
that roller skate

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.500
shouldn't be there.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.200
And of course this is
a crucial thing.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.967
For example, I've learned,
fortunately not from

00:43:16.967 --> 00:43:22.000
experience, but from neighbors
after Hurricane Irene, that if

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.633
a tree in my yard falls on your
house, I'm not to blame.

00:43:29.633 --> 00:43:32.033
Your insurance is going
to have to cover that.

00:43:32.033 --> 00:43:33.900
I'm really sorry about
that tree.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.500
But if you warned me, "I don't
like the look of that

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.967
tree in your yard.

00:43:38.967 --> 00:43:41.100
It's leaning over like this.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.133
I'm afraid in the next storm
it's going to fall in on your

00:43:43.133 --> 00:43:45.533
house," and I don't do
anything, then my

00:43:45.533 --> 00:43:48.100
understanding is that I'm
liable for negligence.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.000
This was a present and
obvious nuisance.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.800
It was an obvious threat, and
my neighbor called my

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.733
attention to it.

00:43:57.733 --> 00:44:00.400
And I didn't do anything.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.300
So next time it storms and your
house is threatened by

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.600
somebody else's tree, just as
the wind starts to blow go

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.600
next door and say, you know, I
don't like the look of that

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.000
tree on your property.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
You better do something.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.233
These are real legal
questions.

00:44:14.233 --> 00:44:18.000
And they are handled in here
with some sophistication.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.500
On the other hand, there
is vengeance.

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.367
It's OK to practice vengeance.

00:44:26.267 --> 00:44:28.600
But there are some
limitations.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:35.800
For example, if I kill you, your
relatives can kill me,

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.100
but they can't just
kill my cousin.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:42.500
This is sort of
individual-directed and not

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.767
clan-directed vengeance.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.967
There's a lot of talk about
compensation and wergeld for

00:44:51.967 --> 00:44:58.467
victims. How much you pay.

00:44:58.467 --> 00:45:00.200
Whether you grab them
by the hair.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.133
Whether you cut off
which finger.

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:07.733
Whether they were free or slave.
Whether they were a

00:45:07.733 --> 00:45:11.367
skilled artisan or a serf.

00:45:11.367 --> 00:45:15.133
I love title ten.

00:45:15.133 --> 00:45:18.033
"If anyone kills a slave,
barbarian by birth, a trained

00:45:18.033 --> 00:45:22.433
house servant or messenger, let
him compound 60 solidi.

00:45:22.433 --> 00:45:26.967
But 200 solidi if the slave is
a skilled goldsmith." 40

00:45:26.967 --> 00:45:29.167
solidi for a carpenter,
and so forth.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.933
If you cut off someone's arm,
it's half of their wergeld.

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:37.433
Wergeld is like murder.

00:45:37.433 --> 00:45:39.200
Their murder value.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.867
So I have a murder value
of 100 solidi.

00:45:41.867 --> 00:45:44.667
Cut off an arm, you've got
to pay me 50 solidi.

00:45:44.667 --> 00:45:48.267
This seems pretty crude,
doesn't it?

00:45:48.267 --> 00:45:52.033
How does it strike you?

00:45:52.033 --> 00:45:52.467
Yes?

00:45:52.467 --> 00:45:57.200
STUDENT: Yeah, it does seem
crude, but I think it gives a

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.067
solution to something that could
cause a total outbreak,

00:45:59.067 --> 00:46:00.100
a civil war.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:03.067
PROFESSOR: It is a
maintenance of peace.

00:46:03.067 --> 00:46:07.100
And what about victims'
compensation?

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:15.767
In the Western legal tradition,
if you injure me,

00:46:15.767 --> 00:46:21.033
it's a crime against the peace,
and the state punishes

00:46:21.033 --> 00:46:23.000
the perpetrator.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.267
Only relatively recently has
this notions of victims'

00:46:26.267 --> 00:46:32.633
rights, victims' compensation,
been entered.

00:46:32.633 --> 00:46:35.933
Which is like a reversion back
to the notion that the crime

00:46:35.933 --> 00:46:40.233
really injures not the state or
the king or the peace that

00:46:40.233 --> 00:46:44.900
we all take for granted,
but the

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:47.833
individual who is affected.

00:46:47.833 --> 00:46:50.433
But what makes it seem
crude is the

00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:53.700
specificity of the offenses.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:58.933
If you look at the Connecticut
Criminal Code, it's not quite

00:46:58.933 --> 00:47:02.500
so precise about hair pulling.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.167
If anyone seizes a freeman by
the hair, the fine is greater

00:47:05.167 --> 00:47:07.933
if he's seized with two
hands than one.

00:47:11.867 --> 00:47:13.267
Maybe that has to
do with intent.

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:18.000
One arm might be instinct.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.267
I'm pulling your hair.

00:47:19.267 --> 00:47:24.633
But two hands argues of serious
intent to do harm.

00:47:24.633 --> 00:47:27.733
Or it's more humiliating.

00:47:27.733 --> 00:47:33.367
This is a culture in which
there's an awful lot of shame

00:47:33.367 --> 00:47:38.033
and compensation for
public shaming.

00:47:38.033 --> 00:47:41.467
A lot of questions of
personal status.

00:47:41.467 --> 00:47:46.500
In title four about theft, if
a slave commits a theft he's

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.867
either beaten or killed,
end of story.

00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:55.267
Freemen, that is to say people
who are not slaves, pay fines

00:47:55.267 --> 00:47:56.533
and compensation.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.767
It's a violent society.

00:48:00.767 --> 00:48:04.100
Course all criminal codes show
various forms of violence.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.433
There's a lot of mutilation.

00:48:05.433 --> 00:48:07.133
There are a lot of assaults
on women.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:16.100
Compensation for assaults on
free women are paid to the

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:20.800
women themselves, but a native
freeman who assaults a

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.367
maid-servant must
pay the master.

00:48:24.367 --> 00:48:28.033
Maid-servant, as a slave, is
regarded as a commodity.

00:48:31.733 --> 00:48:34.667
And then finally, it's a society
in which, at least

00:48:34.667 --> 00:48:38.133
according to the official law
code, men are more valued than

00:48:38.133 --> 00:48:42.867
women, or men are less
regulated than women.

00:48:42.867 --> 00:48:49.167
If a man breaks a marriage, in
title thirty four, he's fined

00:48:49.167 --> 00:48:51.900
if he goes and runs off
with another woman.

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.267
If a woman goes off and runs off
with another man, she's to

00:48:55.267 --> 00:48:56.533
be smothered to death.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.600
On that enlightened
note, we'll leave

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.600
the Burgundian Code.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.533
And indeed we're going to leave
the barbarians only for

00:49:06.533 --> 00:49:07.600
a little while.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.667
Next week we're going to talk
about the Eastern Roman Empire

00:49:10.667 --> 00:49:13.800
and why it survived and even
why it flourished.

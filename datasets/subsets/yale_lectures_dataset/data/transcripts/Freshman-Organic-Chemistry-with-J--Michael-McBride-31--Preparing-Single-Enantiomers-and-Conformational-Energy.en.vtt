00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.354
Prof: Last time we heard
about some medical

00:00:04.354 --> 00:00:06.990
considerations regarding
stereochemistry,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.087
and we're going to just start
today with a little bit about

00:00:10.087 --> 00:00:12.490
legal considerations about
stereochemistry.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.152
First, the doctor gave a
disclosure last time about her

00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:19.620
connections.
 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.730
So I'll do the same thing.
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.899
I've served as a scientific
consultant or expert witness to

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.960
a number of pharmaceutical
companies, including Eisai;

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.940
which is how I knew about that
7389.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.562
I take Lipitor,
and served as an expert witness

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:38.367
for a generic competitor in a
case involving the validity of a

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:41.360
Canadian Lipitor patent by
Pfizer.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.560
And my only connection to
AstraZeneca and omeprazole is as

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.066
an occasional consumer of
Prilosec.

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:48.730
Okay?
 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.200
This book here is very heavy.
 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.150
It's about the stereochemistry
of organic compounds.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.520
And interestingly,
it's from 1994;

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.859
so it's less than fifteen years
old;

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.408
and it's still the bible.
 

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:07.102
And only eight pages of it are
about biological properties,

00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:10.668
and just one of those pages had
anything to do with legal

00:01:10.668 --> 00:01:12.260
things;
which had to do,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.819
incidentally,
with cocaine.

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:17.667
It turned out that somebody was
on trial for cocaine and the

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:21.515
defense had the idea that the
prosecution had not tested the

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:25.950
cocaine to see which enantiomer
it was, &gt;

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.360
as to whether it was -- might
have been artificial;

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.560
because the enantiomer of
cocaine, there's no law against.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.349
It also wouldn't work.
 

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.269
But anyhow, they hadn't tested
it.

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:40.920
So they thought they could get
their client off.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.795
I didn't actually look up the
case to see whether they got off

00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:44.220
or not.
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.680
But that's an interesting
stereochemical application.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.793
But one that made a big
difference was the court

00:01:51.793 --> 00:01:55.470
rejecting a suit about Nexium
marketing.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.141
We saw last time,
and you did a problem for

00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:03.775
today, about Nexium and whether
the advertising seemed

00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:07.230
convincing to you;
or fair, for that matter.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.323
There was a big suit about
that, and this -- in 2005 there

00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:13.550
was a news report about that.
 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.644
"A federal court in
Delaware dismissed a

00:02:16.644 --> 00:02:20.443
class-action lawsuit"
alleging AstraZeneca has had

00:02:20.443 --> 00:02:24.382
misleading marketing of Nexium
and thus added billions to

00:02:24.382 --> 00:02:26.000
healthcare costs.
 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.750
And the "district court
judge,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.287
Sue Robinson,
rejected the suit brought by

00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:33.752
the Pennsylvania Employee
Benefit Trust Fund on behalf of

00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:36.970
entities that foot the bill in
healthcare plans.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.397
According to the health plan
paying organizations,

00:02:39.397 --> 00:02:42.420
the big difference between the
two drugs is not effectiveness,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.710
but advertising."
 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.399
(So you presumably looked at
some of this and have your own

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.419
opinion about that.)
 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.461
"By selling doctors and
patients on the idea that

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.930
patented Nexium is better than
Prilosec,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.870
which faced generic
competition, AstraZeneca was

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.560
able to preserve billions in
sales."

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.770
So, for example,
the year Nexium was introduced,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.139
their advertising budget was
260 million dollars,

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:12.128
and in 2005 it had declined
slightly to 226 million dollars.

00:03:12.128 --> 00:03:15.158
But the sales were 5.8 billion
dollars.

00:03:15.158 --> 00:03:18.558
So the advertising was
negligible, compared to the cost

00:03:18.558 --> 00:03:19.628
of advertising.
 

00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:23.008
"Judge Robinson said the
courts should defer to the U.S.

00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:26.092
FDA in weighing the differences
between drugs,

00:03:26.092 --> 00:03:29.175
and that since the FDA cleared
Nexium's label,

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:31.780
the lawsuit could not
stand."

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.123
So that's interesting,
it shows the importance of the

00:03:35.123 --> 00:03:35.509
FDA.
 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:39.090
Okay, back to chemistry now.
 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.128
In order to market Nexium,
the single enantiomer,

00:03:44.128 --> 00:03:47.081
AstraZeneca had to,
of course, prepare it as a

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.822
single enantiomer,
which meant either resolution

00:03:50.822 --> 00:03:55.628
-- so separation of the right
and the left-handed forms --

00:03:55.628 --> 00:03:59.199
or else preparation of only the
one form,

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.400
the (S)-omeprazole.
 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.258
I noticed that the doctor said
eeso-meprazole.

00:04:05.258 --> 00:04:07.401
Maybe they all pronounce it
that way, but the reason it got

00:04:07.401 --> 00:04:08.729
the name is because it's
S;

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.169
so I say esomeprazole.
 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.055
So how are you going to do it?
 

00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:13.810
Resolution.
 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.879
You could do a Pasteur
conglomerate kind of thing.

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.738
You could make temporary
diastereomers and separate them,

00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:21.220
perhaps by crystallization.
 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.639
Or you could destroy one
enantiomer,

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.793
react the racemate with a
resolved chiral reagent that

00:04:26.793 --> 00:04:30.298
would react with only one,
or maybe a catalyst that would

00:04:30.298 --> 00:04:33.500
catalyze the destruction of only
one, like an enzyme.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.389
Or you could do it nature's way
and prepare only one enantiomer,

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.629
either from a resolved chiral
starting material,

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.220
or using a resolved reagent or
catalyst.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.269
And they tried all of these.
 

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:49.790
So let's look at it.
 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.730
First, resolution of omeprazole
by chromatography.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.663
So they had silica -- which is
what you use probably in your

00:04:57.663 --> 00:05:01.331
chromatography -- but they
coated it with something that

00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:03.199
was a single enantiomer.
 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.420
Now how did they get something
solid that was a single

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.180
enantiomer that they could coat
it with?

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.310
They got it from nature.
 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.360
It was cellulose;
trisphenylcarbamoylcellulose.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.353
And they did this in 1990,
when they were looking forward

00:05:15.353 --> 00:05:18.134
to the time that they'd lose
patent protection on the

00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:18.829
racemate.
 

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:23.120
So there's cellulose and phenyl
isocyanate;

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.769
the thing with two double bonds
in a row there.

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:28.252
Now, what would make,
do you think,

00:05:28.252 --> 00:05:30.370
phenyl isocyanate reactive?
 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.209
Do you see any functional
groups there?

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:38.310
Any ideas?
 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.709
Student:  A double bond
of carbonyl.

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:41.430
Prof: Okay,
carbonyl double bond.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.220
Good.
 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.139
And how about the cellulose?
 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.970
What's going to make it
reactive?

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.670
Student: Hydroxyls.
 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.269
Prof: Rick?
 

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:56.370
What makes cellulose reactive,
any functional groups?

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.189
Student:  It looks like
mostly hydroxy groups.

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:03.600
Prof: So unshared pairs
on oxygen.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.000
Okay, so an unshared pair on
oxygen can attack the carbonyl.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.660
Now, you could in fact use the
C-O or C-N double bond.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.189
And, in fact,
we've seen this before.

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:15.932
This, remember,
is how urea got made,

00:06:15.932 --> 00:06:20.300
from ammonia and the
corresponding acid.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.610
This is just a phenyl derivate
of that acid.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.209
So it does the same thing.
 

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:26.004
And, in fact,
you can do it with all the OHs

00:06:26.004 --> 00:06:26.629
in the group.
 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:30.776
So you put that carbamoyl
group, as it's called,

00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:32.629
on all the oxygens.
 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.994
So that is the chiral stuff
that was on the solid that the

00:06:35.994 --> 00:06:38.120
chromatography was conducted
with.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.959
Now, they weren't able to get
very much.

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:44.620
They did six injections with
chromatography,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.464
and were able to get three 3 mg
of the dextrorotatory and 4 mg

00:06:48.464 --> 00:06:51.932
of the levorotatory stuff
separated by the rate at which

00:06:51.932 --> 00:06:54.769
they would go through this
chiral column.

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:57.627
Now that wasn't enough for any
kind of human testing or

00:06:57.627 --> 00:06:58.209
anything.
 

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.790
You need 20 mg,
remember, for a human dose,

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.019
for just one dose.
 

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:06.879
But what they could do was
measure how fast racemization

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:09.214
was;
because obviously if the stuff

00:07:09.214 --> 00:07:12.285
racemized immediately,
it would be useless to have a

00:07:12.285 --> 00:07:13.550
single enantiomer.
 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.137
So they found out that the
half-life for racemization was

00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:21.891
an hour at 75°,
which they then extrapolated to

00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:25.420
what it would be at a body
temperature to be 100 hours;

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.899
so plenty of time.
 

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:29.420
It's not going to racemize just
spontaneously.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.639
So at least that was not a
trouble.

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:36.536
So this very first quick way of
resolving it allowed them to see

00:07:36.536 --> 00:07:39.800
that it was maybe worthwhile
continuing.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.437
Okay, then they tried
reversible formation of a

00:07:43.437 --> 00:07:45.810
crystalline mandelate ester.
 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.069
Now that red stuff there is
mandelic acid,

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:49.779
which is a natural substance.
 

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:53.029
So you have that as the pure
S enantiomer.

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:57.180
And now you want to react that
with the omeprazole,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.339
with racemic omeprazole.
 

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:02.170
But you do it with an
intermediate compound,

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.079
formaldehyde,
such that the formaldehyde,

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:08.410
the carbonyl group,
gets attacked from both sides,

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.956
one at a time,
by the nitrogen on the

00:08:10.956 --> 00:08:14.209
omeprazole and the oxygen on
mandelic acid,

00:08:14.209 --> 00:08:16.750
to put a CH_2 group between
them.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.281
And we'll talk about that a
lot, that kind of thing,

00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:22.160
when we get onto the chemistry
of aldehydes and ketones.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.980
But anyhow, they could do that.
 

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.540
Now they have what?
 

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.379
They have two things.
 

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:30.629
What's the stereochemical
relationship?

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:34.650
Because they had racemic
omeprazole they had reacted from

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.590
(S)-mandelic acid.
 

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.355
What are the two -- you have
two compounds,

00:08:39.355 --> 00:08:41.200
what's their relationship?
 

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.399
Student:  Diastereomers.
 

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:43.201
Prof: Russell?
 

00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:44.080
They're diastereomers.
 

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.480
So they're different.
 

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.399
So you can crystallize them
apart.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:49.110
Okay, so they did that.
 

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.357
And then the important thing
was that it's a reversible

00:08:52.357 --> 00:08:53.019
reaction.
 

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:55.797
So they could go back again,
adding water,

00:08:55.797 --> 00:08:59.320
and get the omeprazole back,
after the separation.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.197
And now they have both the
R and the S

00:09:02.197 --> 00:09:04.940
versions of them;
both the d and l,

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.634
or the dextrorotatory and the
levorotatory forms of

00:09:07.634 --> 00:09:09.519
omeprazole, in separate bottles.
 

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:12.100
And now they have hundreds of
milligrams.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.115
So it's not enough to do a
large-scale test,

00:09:15.115 --> 00:09:18.058
but they can do some biological
testing.

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:20.957
And with it,
they found that the R

00:09:20.957 --> 00:09:25.159
was four times as active as the
S, in rats that they

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:26.028
studied.
 

00:09:26.028 --> 00:09:28.782
But lo and behold,
when they got into humans,

00:09:28.782 --> 00:09:32.284
it turned out it was reversed,
that the S was more

00:09:32.284 --> 00:09:34.100
active than the R.
 

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.200
So that's why the drug is
(S)-omeprazole.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.817
Okay but that's -- but you're
not going to do this to make

00:09:41.817 --> 00:09:46.212
enough to sell to the public,
especially because you don't

00:09:46.212 --> 00:09:49.240
want to throw away half the
material you make;

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.086
both because you're polluting
the environment and because

00:09:52.086 --> 00:09:54.629
you're wasting the money you put
into making it.

00:09:54.629 --> 00:10:01.678
So they developed a chiral
catalyst involving titanium.

00:10:01.678 --> 00:10:09.070
So there's a titanium bonded to
four alcohols;

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.649
or actually one of them bridges
to another titanium.

00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:14.964
But anyhow, you can do
something called ligand

00:10:14.964 --> 00:10:15.528
exchange.
 

00:10:15.528 --> 00:10:19.559
So the electrons in the bond go
onto the oxygen.

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:23.590
So you have RO- and Ti+;
you've broken the bond.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.788
Now that goes away and a
different one can come in,

00:10:26.788 --> 00:10:29.538
a different alcohol,
and form a new bond.

00:10:29.538 --> 00:10:33.715
So that exchanges the ligands
by losing one and putting on

00:10:33.715 --> 00:10:34.594
another one.
 

00:10:34.594 --> 00:10:35.178
Okay?
 

00:10:35.178 --> 00:10:40.379
Now you can do that trick with
diethyltartrate.

00:10:40.379 --> 00:10:43.403
So two of the oxygens,
the alcohol oxygens of tartaric

00:10:43.403 --> 00:10:45.475
acid,
can exchange for two of the

00:10:45.475 --> 00:10:47.629
alcohols that are on the
titanium,

00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:50.440
and you get this compound of
titanium.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.590
Now what you really want is the
titanium.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.870
That's what's the catalyst.
 

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.470
So you can lose another RO- and
you get this Ti+.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:04.388
And now's when the catalysis
begins, because you bring in a

00:11:04.388 --> 00:11:07.960
peroxy compound,
a hydroperoxide.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.269
So instead of an alcohol,
there are two oxygens there.

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:14.309
And that can do the same trick
and combine with the titanium.

00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:15.750
So you have this compound.
 

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.929
But now you have a different
functional group there.

00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:20.269
You have the O-O bond.
 

00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:22.799
And what makes the O-O bond
reactive?

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:25.100
We've seen this before. Kevin?
 

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.563
Student:  The high
nuclear charge gives the low

00:11:27.563 --> 00:11:27.889
LUMO.
 

00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:30.129
Prof: And what is the
low LUMO?

00:11:30.129 --> 00:11:31.600
Student: 
Ïƒ*.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.714
Prof: Right.
 

00:11:32.714 --> 00:11:35.529
So Ïƒ* is going to
be reactive there.

00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:36.000
Okay?
 

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.668
And you can bring in a sulfur
-- right?

00:11:39.668 --> 00:11:43.702
-- with its unshared pairs,
and they'll react,

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:45.942
make a bond,
break a bond.

00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:46.840
Right?
 

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.803
So you get the sulfur attached
to the oxygen,

00:11:49.803 --> 00:11:52.698
and it's S+,
since it has used its electrons

00:11:52.698 --> 00:11:54.450
to make that new bond.
 

00:11:54.450 --> 00:12:00.667
Now, that thing can come off,
the same way the compound above

00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:02.710
it did;
the RO came off,

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.210
the sulfur compound could come
off.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.493
And that's the sulfoxide;
remember, that's the important

00:12:08.493 --> 00:12:10.429
group in the
(S)-omeprazole;

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:12.389
that's what sets things going.
 

00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:14.990
Okay, so we've got it.
 

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.119
And now that compound on the
lower left, the titanium

00:12:18.119 --> 00:12:21.370
compound, is the same as the one
on the upper right.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.158
So we've made a cycle. Okay?
 

00:12:25.158 --> 00:12:28.035
So that means we can look at
the cycle this way,

00:12:28.035 --> 00:12:29.259
a catalytic cycle.
 

00:12:29.259 --> 00:12:31.690
We bring in ROO-.
 

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.830
It combines with the little
machine.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.139
Then S comes in and RO- comes
out.

00:12:38.139 --> 00:12:42.100
And then S double bond O comes
out.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.950
And you get the catalyst back
again.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.183
You can start at the top and go
-- so you go round and round and

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:50.048
round and round,
and every time you have the

00:12:50.048 --> 00:12:53.014
peroxide come in,
the sulfide come in,

00:12:53.014 --> 00:12:56.580
the RO- comes out,
and the SO comes out.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.875
So essentially the ROO gives
one of its Os,

00:12:59.875 --> 00:13:01.914
the red one,
to the sulfur.

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:02.700
Right?
 

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.090
But it's catalyzed by this.
 

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.583
Now why is it important for
their purposes that this thing

00:13:07.583 --> 00:13:09.240
be involved in catalysis?
 

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.708
We looked last time that you
can put an oxygen on sulfur,

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:14.009
just with peroxide.
 

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:17.063
You don't need the catalyst to
do that, although it's faster

00:13:17.063 --> 00:13:18.100
with the catalyst.
 

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.633
Did they do it just to gain
speed, or can you see something

00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:22.058
else?
 

00:13:22.058 --> 00:13:26.940
What's special about the
catalyst?

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.668
Lucas?
 

00:13:27.668 --> 00:13:28.558
Student:  Well it's one
enantiomer.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:29.239
Prof: Pardon?
 

00:13:29.239 --> 00:13:30.190
It's one enantiomer,
right?

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.538
It's a chiral oxidizing agent.
 

00:13:32.538 --> 00:13:35.731
The peroxide alone would've
been an oxidizing agent,

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:37.360
could've done the trick.
 

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.393
But the chiral oxidizing agent
means that it will discriminate

00:13:42.393 --> 00:13:45.364
between the two hands of the
product.

00:13:45.364 --> 00:13:46.190
Right?
 

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:49.761
It could attack one of the
unshared pairs here,

00:13:49.761 --> 00:13:52.168
or it could attack the other.
 

00:13:52.168 --> 00:13:55.779
And those are enantiomers of
one another.

00:13:55.779 --> 00:13:57.950
But when it's combined with
this thing,

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.705
that has tartaric acid on,
which makes it chiral and of

00:14:01.705 --> 00:14:04.102
one hand,
then those are diastereomers,

00:14:04.102 --> 00:14:07.490
when it attacks this one,
or when this one does the

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.261
attacking.
 

00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:08.879
Right?
 

00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:10.490
So they won't be 50:50.
 

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:15.580
Unfortunately, it was 50:50.
 

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.039
It just happened to be the same
rate.

00:14:18.039 --> 00:14:19.929
So did they give up?
 

00:14:19.929 --> 00:14:22.340
No, they started fiddling.
 

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:30.644
And one thing they did was to
add diisopropylethylamine.

00:14:30.644 --> 00:14:31.549
Why?
 

00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:33.570
Who knows? Right?
 

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:38.495
But they discovered that when
you do that, then you get what's

00:14:38.495 --> 00:14:41.000
called 94% enantiomer excess.
 

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.222
That means the desired
enantiomer is there at 97%,

00:14:47.222 --> 00:14:52.048
and there's 3% of the wrong
enantiomer.

00:14:52.048 --> 00:14:53.320
Right?
 

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.500
So there's an excess of 94% of
the enantiomer you want.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.937
So now all you do is
crystallize it,

00:14:59.937 --> 00:15:01.538
and it gets purified.
 

00:15:01.538 --> 00:15:04.645
You get rid of the 3%,
and you have the stuff you

00:15:04.645 --> 00:15:05.100
want.
 

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.379
And now you can sell it to the
public as Nexium.

00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:10.788
So that's the way you do it
practically, right?

00:15:10.788 --> 00:15:13.070
When you want to make a lot of
stuff you make just one.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:17.470
Okay, so that's what we're
going to say about

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.070
configuration.
 

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.806
And now we have one
"C"

00:15:21.806 --> 00:15:22.490
to go.
 

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.216
We talked about composition,
of course, from the time of

00:15:26.216 --> 00:15:29.087
Lavoisier;
about constitution from the

00:15:29.087 --> 00:15:31.678
time of Couper and
Kekulé.

00:15:31.678 --> 00:15:37.558
But then there are distinctions
based on this bonding model.

00:15:37.558 --> 00:15:41.251
Note that constitution is
already involving the bonding

00:15:41.251 --> 00:15:41.798
model.
 

00:15:41.798 --> 00:15:46.114
But something beyond
constitution is how things are

00:15:46.114 --> 00:15:47.840
arranged in space.
 

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.551
So configuration is obviously
also a question of the model

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:54.287
that you make for bonding,
and conformation,

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:57.080
which is the "C"
we haven't talked about yet.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.754
And those last two are
stereoisomers,

00:15:59.754 --> 00:16:03.620
because they have to do with
arrangement in space;

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.538
which constitution,
as you remember,

00:16:07.538 --> 00:16:08.658
doesn't.
 

00:16:08.658 --> 00:16:11.278
So the difference between
configuration and conformation,

00:16:11.278 --> 00:16:14.370
both of which have to do with
arrangement in space,

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.883
is that the configuration,
you have to break bonds to go

00:16:17.883 --> 00:16:21.778
from one isomer to another,
and in the conformation you

00:16:21.778 --> 00:16:26.100
just rotate about single bonds
to get from one isomer to the

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:26.759
other.
 

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:29.546
And, in general,
it's hard to break bonds and

00:16:29.546 --> 00:16:31.129
easier to rotate bonds.
 

00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:35.634
So typically configurational
isomers last longer than

00:16:35.634 --> 00:16:39.066
conformational isomers;
but not always,

00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:41.428
there can be special cases.
 

00:16:41.428 --> 00:16:45.895
Now all things that you call
isomers represent local energy

00:16:45.895 --> 00:16:46.590
minima.
 

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.837
So the molecule can sit there
at that geometry -- and of

00:16:49.837 --> 00:16:53.558
course it has to be vibrating,
at least zero-point vibration.

00:16:53.558 --> 00:16:56.240
So the atoms are moving,
but they're in a well;

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.375
they stay in the same relative
locations, more or less,

00:16:59.375 --> 00:16:59.840
right?
 

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.168
They vibrate in there.
 

00:17:01.168 --> 00:17:04.118
But then they can get out of
that well and go to a completely

00:17:04.118 --> 00:17:05.890
different well,
and vibrate there.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.239
So not all the different phases
of vibration are considered

00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:12.083
different molecules;
that would be way too much,

00:17:12.083 --> 00:17:14.528
to call those all isomers of
one another.

00:17:14.528 --> 00:17:17.468
Those are all one isomer,
and these are all another

00:17:17.468 --> 00:17:21.230
isomer, but there's some barrier
to get from one to the other;

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.858
so you can have one or the
other.

00:17:22.858 --> 00:17:26.723
And the barriers are typically
higher for configuration and

00:17:26.723 --> 00:17:28.390
lower for conformation.
 

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:33.299
Okay, now we've seen that in
the nineteenth century

00:17:33.299 --> 00:17:36.640
stereochemistry was qualitative.
 

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.818
It was a question of counting
isomers;

00:17:38.818 --> 00:17:42.512
not measuring something but
just counting how many isomers

00:17:42.512 --> 00:17:43.549
you could get.
 

00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:46.009
Very qualitative, right?
 

00:17:46.009 --> 00:17:48.923
But conformation,
which didn't come along until

00:17:48.923 --> 00:17:51.398
much later,
which involves rotational

00:17:51.398 --> 00:17:54.703
isomerism about single bonds,
is much more subtle,

00:17:54.703 --> 00:17:58.240
and it requires quantitative
thought about equilibria,

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.710
rates and energies.
 

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.480
It's not just this qualitative
counting of isomers.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.769
So notice that this
conformational analysis came

00:18:06.769 --> 00:18:11.700
relatively late to the timeline
we're talking about.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.864
All the other stuff we're
talking about happened before --

00:18:14.864 --> 00:18:17.750
most of the other stuff,
with respect to structure --

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.140
happened before 1900.
 

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:23.108
But it was only in 1950 that
conformational analysis began,

00:18:23.108 --> 00:18:27.336
and then twenty-five years
later that people started doing

00:18:27.336 --> 00:18:30.445
significant,
what's called molecular

00:18:30.445 --> 00:18:34.179
mechanics modeling,
treating molecules as if they

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:35.759
were springs and so on.
 

00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:37.490
And we'll talk about that a
little bit later.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:41.238
So remember there you are,
and we can trace your lineage

00:18:41.238 --> 00:18:44.577
back to P.D. Bartlett at
Harvard, who was my Ph.D.

00:18:44.577 --> 00:18:46.280
supervisor, and his Ph.D.
 

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.529
supervisor, J.B. Conant.
 

00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:52.422
Now, those guys were involved
in a special flavor of organic

00:18:52.422 --> 00:18:54.598
chemistry which influences you.
 

00:18:54.598 --> 00:18:57.298
It's called physical-organic
chemistry.

00:18:57.298 --> 00:19:01.492
It's interested not so much in
making new compounds as in why

00:19:01.492 --> 00:19:03.940
compounds behave the way they
do.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.088
So what you've suffered through
this semester is because of

00:19:08.088 --> 00:19:08.875
these guys.
 

00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:09.519
Right?
 

00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:11.730
We talk much more about why
things work --

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.153
how bonding works,
how to recognize a functional

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.064
group --
than we do with memorizing

00:19:16.064 --> 00:19:18.640
reactions that will get you from
here to there.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.527
Okay, so Conant was one of the
founders of this discipline,

00:19:23.527 --> 00:19:25.548
because he did a Ph.D.
 

00:19:25.548 --> 00:19:27.977
with two advisors,
one of whom was a physical

00:19:27.977 --> 00:19:30.460
chemist and one who was an
organic chemist.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.916
So if we go back a little bit
here, you see the blue,

00:19:33.916 --> 00:19:37.108
the organic chemist,
was Kohler, who we've talked

00:19:37.108 --> 00:19:39.501
about, and the red was
T.W. Richards,

00:19:39.501 --> 00:19:42.493
the physical chemist,
who himself studied with

00:19:42.493 --> 00:19:46.423
Wilhelm Ostwald,
who together with van't Hoff

00:19:46.423 --> 00:19:49.297
and Arrhenius --
these three guys here,

00:19:49.297 --> 00:19:52.487
van't Hoff,
Ostwald and Arrhenius -- those

00:19:52.487 --> 00:19:56.023
are the guys who founded
physical chemistry as a

00:19:56.023 --> 00:19:56.852
discipline.
 

00:19:56.852 --> 00:19:57.529
Okay?
 

00:19:57.529 --> 00:20:01.490
So we have a lot more physical
chemistry in this course than

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:05.048
you normally would in an
elementary organic course.

00:20:05.048 --> 00:20:09.932
Now, if you go a little bit
further in the family tree,

00:20:09.932 --> 00:20:14.815
you get G.N. Lewis as well,
whom we've of course talked

00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:15.900
about.
 

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.808
Now, in the late nineteenth
century,

00:20:18.808 --> 00:20:20.910
when these guys were founding
physical chemistry,

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.578
organic chemists focused their
efforts on molecular structure,

00:20:24.578 --> 00:20:27.728
on these things having to do
with configuration and

00:20:27.728 --> 00:20:29.240
enantiomers and so on.
 

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.595
But physical chemists focused
on energy, sometimes to the

00:20:33.595 --> 00:20:35.538
exclusion of structure.
 

00:20:35.538 --> 00:20:38.083
In fact, Ostwald -- oh I forgot
to bring his book,

00:20:38.083 --> 00:20:39.900
I was going to bring to show
you;

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.048
but I have a page from it here.
 

00:20:42.048 --> 00:20:44.769
He wrote lots and lots of
books, Ostwald,

00:20:44.769 --> 00:20:48.374
who's like your four times
great-chemical-grandfather,

00:20:48.374 --> 00:20:49.529
or something.
 

00:20:49.529 --> 00:20:53.492
This Principles of
Chemistry -- which he gave

00:20:53.492 --> 00:20:58.000
the not too modest title An
Introduction to all Chemical

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.400
Textbooks.
 

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.730
So this is what,
if you read it,

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.220
then you were ready to read any
other chemical textbook.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.650
So it was a general view,
in 1907.

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:09.990
And on page 421,
there's a very long footnote.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.730
And if you look at a little bit
of this footnote,

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.954
it says: "Dalton,
who developed the law of

00:21:15.954 --> 00:21:20.303
combining weights on the basis
of an hypothesis he had proposed

00:21:20.303 --> 00:21:23.670
about the composition of matter
from atoms,

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.285
at first took hydrogen as
unity, since it had the smallest

00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:29.016
'atomic weight',
i.e.,

00:21:29.016 --> 00:21:30.069
combining weight."
 

00:21:30.069 --> 00:21:32.368
And so there's the word 'atom'.
 

00:21:32.368 --> 00:21:36.978
And that's the only place,
in 554 pages of this book,

00:21:36.978 --> 00:21:39.460
that the word atom occurs.
 

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.932
It's in the subordinate clause
of a footnote,

00:21:42.932 --> 00:21:46.640
because, at this time,
Ostwald didn't believe in

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.430
atoms.
 

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:48.833
He believed that
philosophically,

00:21:48.833 --> 00:21:51.509
since you couldn't see them,
you shouldn't talk about them;

00:21:51.509 --> 00:21:54.400
so you should do things that
you can deal with.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.640
And energy was such a thing,
he thought.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.720
So physical chemists,
these guys who founded physical

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.787
chemistry,
focused on -- of course,

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:04.705
van't Hoff is interesting
because he's the guy that had

00:22:04.705 --> 00:22:06.759
the idea of the tetrahedral
carbon.

00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:09.180
So he didn't sign off on this,
together with Ostwald.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.368
But Ostwald was much more
influential,

00:22:11.368 --> 00:22:15.528
he had a much bigger school of
students,

00:22:15.528 --> 00:22:21.506
and so he was -- it was only
two years later that he finally

00:22:21.506 --> 00:22:24.950
accepted the existence of atoms.
 

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:27.973
So I'm just drawing for you the
contrast between what organic

00:22:27.973 --> 00:22:31.150
chemists were thinking about and
what physical chemists were.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.919
And now, to deal with
confirmation,

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:38.234
we have to become a little
physical chemist to see the

00:22:38.234 --> 00:22:40.190
influence of energy.
 

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.946
So here's the dedication of
Sterling Chemistry Lab in April

00:22:43.946 --> 00:22:47.640
1923, and there's a group of
people that we'll look at.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.538
And all of these guys here were
students of Ostwald.

00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:54.420
So he had a very broad
influence.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.220
The one there is
T.W. Richards;

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.928
got the first American Nobel
Prize in Chemistry.

00:23:01.928 --> 00:23:02.630
Okay?
 

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:07.289
And he, remember is your
something-grandfather.

00:23:07.289 --> 00:23:08.000
Okay?
 

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.628
So then Donnan,
the next guy -- well there's a

00:23:10.628 --> 00:23:12.906
guy from Canada,
a guy from Britain,

00:23:12.906 --> 00:23:16.470
and the guy on the left there
was a student of Richards,

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.838
so a grand-student of Ostwald;
with his cigar,

00:23:19.838 --> 00:23:21.338
as he always had.
 

00:23:21.338 --> 00:23:24.683
And this guy is Wilder
Bancroft, who was at Cornell,

00:23:24.683 --> 00:23:27.439
and who founded and owned,
for that matter,

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:30.848
the Journal of
Physical Chemistry.

00:23:30.848 --> 00:23:33.529
And he wrote an obituary of
Ostwald,

00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:37.901
in 1933, in which he said:
"Ostwald's gift for

00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:43.320
leadership showed itself in the
way his pupils regarded him all

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.420
through their lives.
 

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.990
They usually believed what
Ostwald said,

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:53.660
even when they knew he was not
right." Okay?

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.568
And no doubt atoms were what he
had in mind;

00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:59.276
that Oswald didn't believe in
atoms, but his students still

00:23:59.276 --> 00:24:00.210
believed in atoms.
 

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.890
Okay, but they all believed in
energy.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.630
Now, did anybody walk past here
this morning?

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.200
You recognize this place?
 

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.450
Okay, you take a different path.
 

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.338
Okay, but have you noticed
what's off on the left there?

00:24:15.338 --> 00:24:20.250
"Here Stood the House of
Josiah Williard Gibbs,

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.721
Class of 1858,
Professor of Mathematical

00:24:22.721 --> 00:24:25.825
Physics."
So Yale has a really special

00:24:25.825 --> 00:24:27.410
connection to energy.
 

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:34.450
There's Gibbs as a freshman,
and here he is in later life.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.737
He spent his whole life here at
Yale, except for one year he

00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:38.740
went to Germany.
 

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.692
So physical chemists were,
and still are,

00:24:42.692 --> 00:24:48.818
quantitative about equilibrium
constants and rate constants.

00:24:48.818 --> 00:24:50.838
So big K is an
equilibrium constant;

00:24:50.838 --> 00:24:52.490
small k is a rate
constant.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.690
And they're related to energy.
 

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.864
So you can call energy
E, or if you're more

00:24:57.864 --> 00:25:01.038
particular you can call it
H, for enthalpy,

00:25:01.038 --> 00:25:03.500
or G for Gibbs free
energy;

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.458
and entropy gets into the
argument, as we'll see in a few

00:25:06.458 --> 00:25:07.038
lectures.
 

00:25:07.038 --> 00:25:10.586
So energy determines what
can happen at

00:25:10.586 --> 00:25:13.217
equilibrium;
that is, if you have this

00:25:13.217 --> 00:25:16.150
stuff, is it possible
spontaneously to go to this

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:16.700
stuff?
 

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.914
If you have forever and ever
for it to happen,

00:25:18.914 --> 00:25:21.769
is it conceivable that this
stuff will go to this stuff?

00:25:21.769 --> 00:25:25.257
It can only happen if it's
downhill in energy,

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:26.420
in free energy.
 

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.038
Okay?
 

00:25:27.038 --> 00:25:31.518
And the equilibrium constant is
determined by -- is related to

00:25:31.518 --> 00:25:33.058
energy in this way.
 

00:25:33.058 --> 00:25:35.440
And here's something that's
really handy,

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.171
and you'll impress subsequent
teachers and your roommates and

00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:42.590
everyone else is you remember
this: that if you know the

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.452
change in energy,
in kilocalories per mole,

00:25:45.452 --> 00:25:48.259
you can say what the
equilibrium constant is,

00:25:48.259 --> 00:25:52.519
because it's 10^(-3/4 of
whatever that is).

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:57.401
So suppose the difference
between this and this is 4

00:25:57.401 --> 00:25:58.548
kcal/mole.
 

00:25:58.548 --> 00:26:01.250
What will the equilibrium
constant be?

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.380
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:09.279
Prof: It'll be 1000;
10^(3/4 of 4);

00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:13.058
3/4 of 4 is 3;
10^3 is 1000.

00:26:13.058 --> 00:26:15.450
So the equilibrium constant is
going be 1000.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:19.588
Now whether it's 1000 or 1/1000
depends on which way you're

00:26:19.588 --> 00:26:20.160
going.
 

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.450
But obviously it's going to
favor the one downhill.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.290
So you have to keep your
thinking cap on to get the right

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:25.900
direction.
 

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:30.095
But 10^(-3/4 of
Î”H),

00:26:30.095 --> 00:26:35.338
or -- yes, 10^(-3/4) is the way
to do it.

00:26:35.338 --> 00:26:36.519
Okay.
 

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:40.250
But you can also say something
about how fast it will go.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.690
This is just whether it's
conceivable that it will go;

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.858
the big K.
 

00:26:43.858 --> 00:26:45.660
The little k says how
fast.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.594
Because rates -- this is an
approximation,

00:26:48.594 --> 00:26:52.890
this isn't written on the
tablets by the angel or someone.

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:56.374
But for practical purposes,
for our purposes,

00:26:56.374 --> 00:27:00.807
the rate in seconds -- that is,
how many per second -- is

00:27:00.807 --> 00:27:01.599
10^13.
 

00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:04.420
So that's very fast;
10^13^( )per second.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.617
But then it gets cut down by
how big the energy barrier is

00:27:08.617 --> 00:27:10.460
you have to get across.
 

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.007
Cutting down is exactly the
same kind of thing you have in

00:27:14.007 --> 00:27:16.868
the big K,
10^(-3/4 Î”H).

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:19.963
So you could again -- that
energy is called activation

00:27:19.963 --> 00:27:20.490
energy.
 

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.048
It's how high the barrier is
that you have to get over.

00:27:23.048 --> 00:27:26.868
And you can use the same trick
of the 3/4ths.

00:27:26.868 --> 00:27:31.631
So it's, the rate constant is
10^(13-(3/4 of whatever

00:27:31.631 --> 00:27:36.634
the energy)).^( )So suppose you
had a fourty kilocalorie energy

00:27:36.634 --> 00:27:40.724
barrier you had to get across;
suppose you had a forty

00:27:40.724 --> 00:27:43.650
kilocalorie energy barrier you
had to get across.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.720
Forty kilocalorie energy
barrier, right?

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.799
How fast would the rate
constant be?

00:27:53.559 --> 00:27:54.740
Becky, why don't you help me?
 

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:59.588
So the barrier is 40 kcal that
you have to get across.

00:27:59.588 --> 00:28:03.009
So now how am I going to plug
that in here?

00:28:03.009 --> 00:28:05.470
Student:  10^13th.
 

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.150
Prof: Okay,
so 3/4ths of forty I need,

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:09.819
right?
 

00:28:09.819 --> 00:28:11.150
So what's that?
 

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.240
Student:  Ten -- or
thirty.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.796
Prof: Thirty.
 

00:28:14.796 --> 00:28:16.818
Okay, so it's 10^(13-30).
 

00:28:16.818 --> 00:28:19.970
Okay, what's thirteen minus
thirty?

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.078
Student:  Negative
twenty-seven.

00:28:22.078 --> 00:28:25.548
Prof: Okay,
so it's 10^-27 per second.

00:28:25.548 --> 00:28:30.019
Do you think that's very fast,
10^-27?

00:28:30.019 --> 00:28:34.318
That's a pretty small number,
right?

00:28:34.318 --> 00:28:38.336
So forget spontaneously,
at room temperature,

00:28:38.336 --> 00:28:42.902
going over a barrier of 40
kcal/mole, for practical

00:28:42.902 --> 00:28:44.089
purposes.
 

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:46.068
But you have this T here.
 

00:28:46.068 --> 00:28:49.720
So if you increase the absolute
temperature, then you make that

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.605
forbidding factor smaller and
smaller and smaller,

00:28:52.605 --> 00:28:53.960
up in the exponent.
 

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.038
So if you heat it up,
you can make the reaction go.

00:28:56.038 --> 00:28:59.030
Okay, so anyhow,
that's really helpful,

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.548
to remember this 3/4ths trick.
 

00:29:01.548 --> 00:29:07.296
Okay, now conformation involves
rotational isomerization about

00:29:07.296 --> 00:29:08.710
single bonds.
 

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:12.821
So the question is,
how free is single bond

00:29:12.821 --> 00:29:13.900
rotation?
 

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.349
Paternó
said it wasn't free at all;

00:29:17.349 --> 00:29:19.970
I can count isomers that way.
 

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.913
I can have this isomer,
and I can have this isomer,

00:29:23.913 --> 00:29:26.910
and I can have this isomer --
right?

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:29.019
-- for purposes of counting.
 

00:29:29.019 --> 00:29:33.750
But van't Hoff says no,
don't count isomers like that.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:35.529
Because why?
 

00:29:35.529 --> 00:29:38.910
Why shouldn't you count isomers
like that?

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.240
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.170
Prof: Because they
rotate too easily,

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:43.529
right?
 

00:29:43.529 --> 00:29:45.094
It's like that in his picture.
 

00:29:45.094 --> 00:29:45.460
Right?
 

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.815
So you shouldn't count this and
this and this and this.

00:29:48.815 --> 00:29:49.250
Okay?
 

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:54.090
Now, there are different kinds
of models, something like these,

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:58.308
and some of them you can rotate
easily, but not others.

00:29:58.308 --> 00:29:59.089
Right?
 

00:29:59.089 --> 00:30:01.920
Which one's realistic? Right?
 

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.558
Or this one you can rotate,
it's just not easy to rotate --

00:30:05.558 --> 00:30:05.935
right?
 

00:30:05.935 --> 00:30:07.380
-- it sticks,
right?

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.618
Or this one,
remember, that Fischer used;

00:30:09.618 --> 00:30:13.269
which is good because you can
bend it, for his purposes,

00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:16.589
for drawing two-dimensional
Fischer projections.

00:30:16.589 --> 00:30:19.598
But forget rotating that. Right?
 

00:30:19.598 --> 00:30:21.773
It could vibrate,
but it can't -- you can't

00:30:21.773 --> 00:30:23.481
rotate it, it'll always come
back.

00:30:23.481 --> 00:30:24.000
Right?
 

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.980
So the question is,
which model is right?

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:30.579
Can you rotate or can't you
rotate, and how hard is it to

00:30:30.579 --> 00:30:31.318
rotate?
 

00:30:31.318 --> 00:30:33.547
Because that's going to
determine how fast these things

00:30:33.547 --> 00:30:33.960
will be.
 

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:39.328
Okay, now notice that both of
these authors drew their

00:30:39.328 --> 00:30:44.799
pictures with a conformation
which we call eclipsed.

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:46.430
Now eclipsed means these.
 

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:49.391
It means this,
that the ones on the top are

00:30:49.391 --> 00:30:51.506
right over ones on the bottom.
 

00:30:51.506 --> 00:30:52.068
Okay?
 

00:30:52.068 --> 00:30:56.180
And the same is true in van't
Hoff's tetrahedra -- right?

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.670
-- right above the others.
 

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:01.445
Obviously you could rotate
60° on the top and

00:31:01.445 --> 00:31:05.300
everything would be staggered,
not directly above.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.009
Okay?
 

00:31:06.009 --> 00:31:09.368
Notice, incidentally,
that from the exam we looked at

00:31:09.368 --> 00:31:11.890
the Molecule of the Week,
for last week,

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.410
from the American Chemical
Society.

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:16.819
And notice how it's drawn.
 

00:31:16.819 --> 00:31:17.470
Right?
 

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.058
It also is eclipsed.
 

00:31:19.058 --> 00:31:23.548
This red one here is directly
opposite this red one here.

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:26.259
This acid group is directly
opposite that hydrogen,

00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:29.349
and this acid group is directly
opposite that hydrogen;

00:31:29.349 --> 00:31:31.108
it's eclipsed, right?
 

00:31:31.108 --> 00:31:34.450
And here, this CO_2 is directly
above that CO_2;

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.788
it's eclipsed, right?
 

00:31:36.788 --> 00:31:42.420
Now you need notation and names
to talk about these things.

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.292
And the projection that was
invented for this purpose was

00:31:46.292 --> 00:31:50.374
invented by someone who sat in
the seat that some of you are

00:31:50.374 --> 00:31:51.134
sitting in.
 

00:31:51.134 --> 00:31:52.450
I don't which.
 

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.717
Maybe -- he probably,
in the course of his

00:31:54.717 --> 00:31:57.259
undergraduate years and also
getting his Ph.D.,

00:31:57.259 --> 00:31:59.970
he probably sat in most of the
seats in here;

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.559
or many of them anyhow.
 

00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:03.048
But his name was Melvin Newman.
 

00:32:03.048 --> 00:32:06.227
You see he graduated from Yale
in '29 and got his Ph.D.

00:32:06.227 --> 00:32:08.640
in '32, and then he went to
Ohio State.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:14.930
And he invented a way of
drawing conformations on paper.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:18.329
So there are two carbons,
and the convention is,

00:32:18.329 --> 00:32:21.875
for the Newman projection,
that you sight down the

00:32:21.875 --> 00:32:23.538
carbon-carbon bond.
 

00:32:23.538 --> 00:32:27.792
So I'm going to show this,
the rotation around this

00:32:27.792 --> 00:32:28.898
central bond.
 

00:32:28.898 --> 00:32:29.578
Okay?
 

00:32:29.578 --> 00:32:33.872
So I look right along that
bond, and there's one carbon in

00:32:33.872 --> 00:32:37.938
front and one carbon behind,
and each of them has three

00:32:37.938 --> 00:32:38.916
things on it.
 

00:32:38.916 --> 00:32:39.670
Okay?
 

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:43.391
So the one behind,
here, has three hydrogens,

00:32:43.391 --> 00:32:46.857
and the one in front hides the
one behind.

00:32:46.857 --> 00:32:47.618
Okay?
 

00:32:47.618 --> 00:32:50.470
But it has three other groups
on it too.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.759
Everybody see how he's doing
this;

00:32:51.759 --> 00:32:53.048
that that shows this?
 

00:32:53.048 --> 00:32:55.440
Well it shows it without the
methyl groups here.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:00.348
Okay, and he calls that
staggered, right?

00:33:00.348 --> 00:33:05.501
But you can also have them be
right on top of one another,

00:33:05.501 --> 00:33:06.405
like this.
 

00:33:06.405 --> 00:33:07.220
Right?
 

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.808
And that's called eclipsed.
 

00:33:08.808 --> 00:33:11.732
And that's the way it was shown
on the previous slide by

00:33:11.732 --> 00:33:13.824
Paternó,
by van't Hoff,

00:33:13.824 --> 00:33:18.520
and by the ACS operative who
made the Molecule of the Week.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.170
Okay?
 

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:23.523
Now that's not so convenient,
because you can't see the stuff

00:33:23.523 --> 00:33:24.250
in back.
 

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:27.630
So sometimes people turn it a
little bit that way,

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:31.078
or sometimes they turn it a
little bit that way;

00:33:31.078 --> 00:33:33.912
by which they don't mean that
it's not eclipsed,

00:33:33.912 --> 00:33:37.047
they just mean I want to be
able to show both things.

00:33:37.047 --> 00:33:37.650
Right?
 

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.759
Now that's very cumbersome,
and the reason you don't mind

00:33:41.759 --> 00:33:45.721
that it's cumbersome is that
things are never eclipsed,

00:33:45.721 --> 00:33:47.848
they're always staggered.
 

00:33:47.848 --> 00:33:51.505
So all those previous pictures
were wrong, including the

00:33:51.505 --> 00:33:54.828
Molecule of the Week,
because conformations tend to

00:33:54.828 --> 00:33:56.890
be staggered,
not eclipsed.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:59.828
Okay, but anyhow you can draw
them this way.

00:33:59.828 --> 00:34:02.900
Okay, and that's just a
conventional way of drawing

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.284
something that's eclipsed;
because, as you can see,

00:34:06.284 --> 00:34:08.293
it's not truly 100% eclipsed.
 

00:34:08.293 --> 00:34:08.780
Okay?
 

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.083
Now, when you have substituents
on those things,

00:34:11.083 --> 00:34:14.170
you can give different names to
different phases of rotation.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:16.626
For example,
they could be exactly opposite

00:34:16.626 --> 00:34:19.940
one another, like that;
which if this were a double

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.132
bond you would call
trans,

00:34:22.132 --> 00:34:22.954
or E.
 

00:34:22.954 --> 00:34:23.639
Right?
 

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:27.295
But for a single bond,
you look at it with a Newman

00:34:27.295 --> 00:34:30.878
projection like this,
and it's called anti.

00:34:30.878 --> 00:34:31.610
Right?
 

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:37.192
Or you can have it rotated like
this, and be what's called

00:34:37.192 --> 00:34:38.760
gauche.
 

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.425
And I've never found out why
it's called gauche.

00:34:42.425 --> 00:34:43.050
Right?
 

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.059
But notice something about that.
 

00:34:45.059 --> 00:34:49.411
Is this, is it, anti, chiral;
is that conformation chiral,

00:34:49.411 --> 00:34:51.329
or is it superimposable on it?
 

00:34:51.329 --> 00:34:53.079
Is there a mirror?
 

00:34:53.079 --> 00:34:54.090
Student:  Yes.
 

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.686
Prof: Right,
there's a mirror right here.

00:34:56.686 --> 00:34:57.130
Right?
 

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:58.489
So it's its own mirror image.
 

00:34:58.489 --> 00:35:05.449
How about gauche, is it chiral;
is there a mirror here?

00:35:05.449 --> 00:35:07.340
There's a twofold axis here.
 

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.094
If I rotate it like this,
if I had you close your eyes

00:35:11.094 --> 00:35:14.565
and did that rotation,
you couldn't tell whether I

00:35:14.565 --> 00:35:15.840
rotated it or not.
 

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.619
Right?
 

00:35:16.619 --> 00:35:18.199
It's like a propeller.
 

00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:25.259
But if I take another one like
this and make the mirror image

00:35:25.259 --> 00:35:29.612
of this gauche one,
like this -- here,

00:35:29.612 --> 00:35:30.789
right?
 

00:35:30.789 --> 00:35:32.889
This is a mirror image.
 

00:35:32.889 --> 00:35:34.168
Everybody see?
 

00:35:34.168 --> 00:35:34.900
Right?
 

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.896
But I can't superimpose them.
 

00:35:36.896 --> 00:35:37.380
Right?
 

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:41.246
If I superimpose the back
three, the front ones are not.

00:35:41.246 --> 00:35:41.809
Right?
 

00:35:41.809 --> 00:35:43.289
So these are chiral.
 

00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:47.963
So, with respect to gauche,
we have enantiomers.

00:35:47.963 --> 00:35:48.760
Right?
 

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.909
That one as well.
 

00:35:49.909 --> 00:35:54.407
And one of them we call minus
and the other we call plus.

00:35:54.407 --> 00:35:54.969
Okay?
 

00:35:54.969 --> 00:35:59.371
And now if you have -- the
analog for eclipsed is that you

00:35:59.371 --> 00:36:02.768
can have something that's fully
eclipsed,

00:36:02.768 --> 00:36:05.985
like that, where the special
groups are right on top of one

00:36:05.985 --> 00:36:06.539
another.
 

00:36:06.539 --> 00:36:10.239
Or it can be like that. Right?
 

00:36:10.239 --> 00:36:14.110
So and that can be one way or
the other;

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:17.500
and again it's twisted,
like a propeller would be.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.527
And these are again cumbersome
things to draw,

00:36:20.527 --> 00:36:22.210
with Newman projection.
 

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:25.893
But you don't worry about their
being cumbersome because you

00:36:25.893 --> 00:36:29.615
don't have to draw them usually,
because they're not energy

00:36:29.615 --> 00:36:34.184
minima, they're not isomers,
they're barriers between going

00:36:34.184 --> 00:36:36.047
from one to another.
 

00:36:36.047 --> 00:36:36.699
Okay?
 

00:36:36.699 --> 00:36:38.639
But again, those would be minus
and plus.

00:36:38.639 --> 00:36:43.228
And if you want to be really
pedantic and meet in a committee

00:36:43.228 --> 00:36:47.130
of the Pure and Applied
Chemistry people,

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.416
the IUPAC, and decide precisely
what you're going to call

00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:52.967
different things,
then you get together and you

00:36:52.967 --> 00:36:56.175
scratch your head,
and for different rotations of

00:36:56.175 --> 00:36:59.335
the thing in back,
with respect to the thing in

00:36:59.335 --> 00:37:01.907
front,
you have these different

00:37:01.907 --> 00:37:05.755
pedantic names:
synperiplanar is the one that

00:37:05.755 --> 00:37:10.117
we call fully eclipsed;
and you can have anticlinal and

00:37:10.117 --> 00:37:13.284
synclinal and synperiplanar,
and plus and minus,

00:37:13.284 --> 00:37:14.159
and so on.
 

00:37:14.159 --> 00:37:15.630
But you never do that really.
 

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.320
But it's there if you need it.
 

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.550
Okay, so there's a notation,
Newman projection,

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:24.539
and there's a nomenclature,
which can be sort of simple,

00:37:24.539 --> 00:37:26.719
like on the previous slide,
or very complicated,

00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:29.000
like this, that allows you to
discuss these things;

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.050
to draw and discuss them.
 

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.800
Now, but here's the practical
question.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:38.597
Is the threefold barrier -- so
if you have ethane,

00:37:38.597 --> 00:37:46.289
like this, and you rotate this,
the energy will go up and down;

00:37:46.289 --> 00:37:49.619
the energies will be different
for different angles of

00:37:49.619 --> 00:37:50.309
rotation.
 

00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:52.963
But obviously there's a certain
symmetry, that this,

00:37:52.963 --> 00:37:55.463
if it's all hydrogens,
will be the same energy as

00:37:55.463 --> 00:37:57.650
this, will be the same energy as
this.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:00.630
And for the eclipsed,
this will be the same as this,

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:02.092
will be the same as this.
 

00:38:02.092 --> 00:38:02.559
Okay?
 

00:38:02.559 --> 00:38:04.869
So there's a threefold barrier.
 

00:38:04.869 --> 00:38:08.320
Now the question is -- two,
there are two questions.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.429
How big is the barrier?
 

00:38:09.429 --> 00:38:11.409
So are we going to be able to
have isomers?

00:38:11.409 --> 00:38:14.268
And, what's the energy minimum?
 

00:38:14.268 --> 00:38:17.217
Now let's just suppose,
together with van't Hoff and

00:38:17.217 --> 00:38:19.586
Paternó
and the person who made the

00:38:19.586 --> 00:38:23.304
Molecule of the Week,
that the lowest energy -- if we

00:38:23.304 --> 00:38:26.518
plot energy versus phase of
rotation here --

00:38:26.518 --> 00:38:28.809
that the lowest energy is
0°;

00:38:28.809 --> 00:38:31.188
that's fully eclipsed,
like this.

00:38:31.188 --> 00:38:31.710
Okay?
 

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.139
That's 0°.
 

00:38:33.139 --> 00:38:36.436
And now we'll start turning it,
and the energy may go up,

00:38:36.436 --> 00:38:39.498
when we go to a staggered,
and then down and then up,

00:38:39.498 --> 00:38:40.382
down, up, down.
 

00:38:40.382 --> 00:38:41.030
Right?
 

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.936
And then you're back where you
started, once you've gone

00:38:43.936 --> 00:38:44.940
through 360°.
 

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.721
Or is there a big barrier?
 

00:38:47.721 --> 00:38:48.469
Right?
 

00:38:48.469 --> 00:38:49.900
Is the barrier small or big?
 

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.320
Now how can you tell?
 

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.309
Here's an interesting thing,
a way to tell,

00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.880
right?
 

00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.110
That if there's a big barrier,
then the things are going to be

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.619
quantized in it;
the energies are being

00:39:02.619 --> 00:39:03.250
quantized.
 

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:06.485
But the energy is -- if the
barrier is very,

00:39:06.485 --> 00:39:10.625
very small, then almost any
energy you have is above the

00:39:10.625 --> 00:39:13.559
barrier, and so it's not
quantized.

00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:16.777
Remember, when you get above a
barrier you can have energy,

00:39:16.777 --> 00:39:18.000
any energy you want.
 

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.856
It's only when the thing is
bounded on both sides that the

00:39:21.856 --> 00:39:24.900
wave function has to come down
and reach zero.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:25.510
Okay?
 

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:29.742
So if the barrier is big,
the energy will only be certain

00:39:29.742 --> 00:39:33.976
amounts, but if the energy's
very small, you can have any

00:39:33.976 --> 00:39:35.489
energy you want.
 

00:39:35.489 --> 00:39:37.559
And that you can tell.
 

00:39:37.559 --> 00:39:41.257
That is, in fact,
how it was discovered how big

00:39:41.257 --> 00:39:45.681
the barrier for rotation was,
was by measuring something

00:39:45.681 --> 00:39:48.494
having to do with energy,
with heat.

00:39:48.494 --> 00:39:49.380
Okay?
 

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:53.947
And here's -- so the question
is, is the energy quantized in

00:39:53.947 --> 00:39:55.650
this triple minimum?
 

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:57.530
We've talked about double
minima.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:59.099
This is actually a triple
minimum.

00:39:59.099 --> 00:40:04.416
Okay, so they measured in 1936
the absorption of heat by

00:40:04.416 --> 00:40:09.539
ethane, going down to a very,
very low temperature.

00:40:09.539 --> 00:40:12.257
This starts at 150 Kelvin,
but I think they went further

00:40:12.257 --> 00:40:12.849
than that.
 

00:40:12.849 --> 00:40:17.179
So there's a thing called
entropy;

00:40:17.179 --> 00:40:20.217
and we'll talk about that in
different terms,

00:40:20.217 --> 00:40:23.532
a little bit -- in a week or
two, after vacation.

00:40:23.532 --> 00:40:23.876
Okay?
 

00:40:23.876 --> 00:40:24.498
Vacation.
 

00:40:24.498 --> 00:40:26.570
&gt;
 

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:29.235
Okay, so there's a thing called
heat capacity,

00:40:29.235 --> 00:40:32.079
C_p, which is how much
heat you absorb.

00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:34.635
So entropy is defined,
by people who do

00:40:34.635 --> 00:40:36.449
thermodynamics,
in this way:

00:40:36.449 --> 00:40:38.400
that you sum up,
or integrate,

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.829
starting from zero Kelvin --
remember Kelvin?

00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:44.315
-- all the way up to whatever
temperature you're interested

00:40:44.315 --> 00:40:44.530
in.
 

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.860
You sum up how much heat is
being absorbed;

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.927
so C_p times
temperature, that's how much

00:40:50.927 --> 00:40:54.780
heat is being absorbed at each
temperature, as you go up.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.842
As you raise the temperature,
more and more heat gets

00:40:56.842 --> 00:40:57.280
absorbed.
 

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.179
But you always divide it by the
temperature, as you go up.

00:41:01.179 --> 00:41:04.690
So if you absorb heat at very
low temperature,

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:07.543
that makes a much bigger
difference than absorbing the

00:41:07.543 --> 00:41:11.360
same heat at high temperature,
in this quantity called entropy.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.054
So don't worry about it,
except by this definition for

00:41:14.054 --> 00:41:14.360
now.
 

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.333
And this is very technical and
not so very important to what

00:41:17.333 --> 00:41:18.039
we're doing.
 

00:41:18.039 --> 00:41:19.849
So don't get tied up in knots
about it.

00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:24.860
But anyhow, if you have larger
quantized spacings,

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.867
then less heat gets absorbed --
and I'll show you that on the

00:41:27.867 --> 00:41:31.070
next slide --
and the heat that gets absorbed

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.998
gets absorbed at a higher
temperature.

00:41:33.998 --> 00:41:34.710
Right?
 

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:37.380
So both those factors mean that
the entropy,

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.570
at any given temperature,
is going to be smaller,

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:43.018
because you've absorbed less
stuff in the numerator,

00:41:43.018 --> 00:41:45.659
and you've absorbed it at a
higher temperature;

00:41:45.659 --> 00:41:48.175
so you have a bigger
denominator for all these

00:41:48.175 --> 00:41:49.070
contributions.
 

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:52.579
Okay, so the results in 1936
were this.

00:41:52.579 --> 00:41:55.820
If you're interested in what
the entropy of ethane is,

00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:00.268
at 298 Kelvin,
it turns out experimentally --

00:42:00.268 --> 00:42:01.889
that's what they did out at
Berkeley --

00:42:01.889 --> 00:42:07.420
they found it was 54.8 plus or
minus 0.2 entropy units.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.699
And then they calculated how
high that would be,

00:42:10.699 --> 00:42:13.978
for different heights of this
threefold barrier,

00:42:13.978 --> 00:42:16.840
and the quantization that's
involved.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.523
And what they saw was that if
the barrier were zero,

00:42:20.523 --> 00:42:22.547
that number,
instead of 54.8,

00:42:22.547 --> 00:42:23.920
should be 56.4.
 

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:28.099
If the barrier were 0.3,
it should be 56.3.

00:42:28.099 --> 00:42:32.989
If the barrier's 3.1,
it should be 54.6;

00:42:32.989 --> 00:42:36.474
which is within experimental
error of the experiment.

00:42:36.474 --> 00:42:37.010
Right?
 

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:41.179
So that showed that the barrier
was about 3 kcal/mole.

00:42:41.179 --> 00:42:43.969
So it wasn't totally free
rotation.

00:42:43.969 --> 00:42:46.039
It was just pretty fast.
 

00:42:46.039 --> 00:42:52.179
So suppose the barrier had been
4 kcal/mole, instead of three;

00:42:52.179 --> 00:42:53.130
just suppose it were four.
 

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:56.110
How fast -- what would the rate
constant be for the rotation?

00:42:56.110 --> 00:43:00.820
So the barrier is 4 kcal/mole,
that you have to get over.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.289
How do I deal with that? Sam?
 

00:43:03.289 --> 00:43:08.619
Student:  It's this --
Prof: There's a trick,

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:08.829
right?
 

00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:11.010
Student:  10 to the --
Prof: 10 to the minus --

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:12.760
Student:  -3/4.
 

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.989
So 3/4 times four is three.
 

00:43:14.989 --> 00:43:17.320
Prof: Okay,
so it's going to be to the --

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.650
there's going to be a -3,
up in the exponent.

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:22.269
And what else is going to be in
the exponent?

00:43:22.269 --> 00:43:23.190
Remember, for a rate?
 

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:24.139
Students:  Thirteen.
 

00:43:24.139 --> 00:43:25.329
Prof: 10^13.
 

00:43:25.329 --> 00:43:29.570
So it's 10^(13-3),
which is ten to the --

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.150
Student:  To the tenth.
 

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.119
Prof: 10^10 per second.
 

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:37.849
So it would take 10^-10th
seconds for it to rotate.

00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:41.911
That's pretty darn easy,
at room temperature.

00:43:41.911 --> 00:43:42.650
Right?
 

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:43.434
Pretty easy.
 

00:43:43.434 --> 00:43:46.443
But not perfectly free,
and enough to make this

00:43:46.443 --> 00:43:48.340
difference in the entropy.
 

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.429
Now, let me just see what time
it is;

00:43:50.429 --> 00:43:51.460
okay, we have time to do this.
 

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:55.780
Okay, so we're now going to use
that big K,

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.809
equilibrium constant.
 

00:43:57.809 --> 00:44:02.661
So suppose we have something
that has -- this rotor say --

00:44:02.661 --> 00:44:07.856
that has a barrier of such that
the spacing between successive

00:44:07.856 --> 00:44:10.070
levels is 1 kcal/mole.
 

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.079
Suppose it's a harmonic
oscillator.

00:44:12.079 --> 00:44:13.130
We already did that.
 

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:17.226
The lowest zero-point level,
you got to have that energy,

00:44:17.226 --> 00:44:20.518
and then 1 kcal above that,
1 kcal, 1 kcal.

00:44:20.518 --> 00:44:24.052
Now what we're going to do is
see how much energy,

00:44:24.052 --> 00:44:26.215
extra energy,
above zero-point,

00:44:26.215 --> 00:44:30.110
is there at equilibrium,
at any given temperature.

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:34.706
So we have some stuff -- at
equilibrium there's going to be

00:44:34.706 --> 00:44:39.699
stuff that has no extra energy,
zero-point, a certain amount.

00:44:39.699 --> 00:44:44.036
But there'll be a certain
amount that has 1 kcal/mole,

00:44:44.036 --> 00:44:46.409
that's in that first level.
 

00:44:46.409 --> 00:44:50.128
Now how do I know how much is
in that first level,

00:44:50.128 --> 00:44:51.420
at equilibrium?
 

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:56.034
How do I know the ratio of
what's in the top to what's in

00:44:56.034 --> 00:44:59.659
the bottom, if the spacing is 1
kcal/mole?

00:44:59.659 --> 00:45:00.849
Is there a way of doing that?
 

00:45:00.849 --> 00:45:03.688
You don't have to do the
numbers, but tell me what

00:45:03.688 --> 00:45:06.235
formula you would use,
to get the equilibrium

00:45:06.235 --> 00:45:06.989
constant.
 

00:45:06.989 --> 00:45:09.130
Katelyn, do you remember?
 

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:10.550
Sophie?
 

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:15.519
How do you get the big K;
how does it relate to energy?

00:45:15.519 --> 00:45:16.489
Anybody remember?
 

00:45:16.489 --> 00:45:18.630
We already did the hard one.
 

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:19.090
Eric?
 

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:19.980
Student:  10^-3/4ths.
 

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.862
Prof: 10^-3/4ths of one.
 

00:45:22.862 --> 00:45:23.420
Okay.
 

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.719
That's at room temperature.
 

00:45:24.719 --> 00:45:26.219
It's different at other
temperatures.

00:45:26.219 --> 00:45:29.521
Okay, so we know how much
there's going to be -- what

00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:32.507
fraction of the stuff,
of the stuff that's here,

00:45:32.507 --> 00:45:34.730
is going to be one kilocalorie.
 

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:39.730
Ah, it's going to be 10^-3/4th,
of this;

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:42.722
so something like 1/10th of it.
 

00:45:42.722 --> 00:45:43.400
Right?
 

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:46.320
10^-1 would be 1/10th. Okay?
 

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.358
And then there'll be stuff
here, and the amount here,

00:45:49.358 --> 00:45:52.750
relative to the amount here --
this is what we're doing.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:55.927
So that ratio,
the ratio of 0:1 is going to be

00:45:55.927 --> 00:45:59.599
the same as the ratio of 1:2,
because that one is one

00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:01.789
kilocalorie above this one.
 

00:46:01.789 --> 00:46:06.157
And the same for the third to
the second, or the fourth to the

00:46:06.157 --> 00:46:06.730
third.
 

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:09.780
So then we can sum all these
up, knowing the ratios,

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:13.309
and figure out what percentage
there is of each of these.

00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:18.199
And it turns out that that
10^(-3/4) is 5.6.

00:46:18.199 --> 00:46:21.887
So there's going to be 5.6
times as much here as there is

00:46:21.887 --> 00:46:24.929
here;
5.6 times as much here as there

00:46:24.929 --> 00:46:27.284
is here;
5.6 times as much here as there

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:27.750
is here.
 

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:33.945
And if you translate that into
percentages, it'll be that

00:46:33.945 --> 00:46:39.255
there's 81.9% here and
1/5.6,14.8% there and 2.7,

00:46:39.255 --> 00:46:41.800
and 0.5%, and 0.1%.
 

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:46.952
But of course this stuff added
only -- this 14% added only 1

00:46:46.952 --> 00:46:48.000
kcal/mole.
 

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.460
This one added two.
 

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:50.840
This one added three.
 

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.719
This one added four.
 

00:46:51.719 --> 00:46:55.824
So you sum all those up and you
get how much energy -- how much

00:46:55.824 --> 00:46:57.150
heat was absorbed.
 

00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:00.230
This didn't absorb anything,
it's still in the lowest.

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:04.409
This absorbed a certain amount,
14.8 -- right?

00:47:04.409 --> 00:47:09.840
-- .148, and then twice that,
0.027, and so on.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.333
So you can sum it up and see
how much heat would've been

00:47:13.333 --> 00:47:15.940
absorbed by the time you get out
there.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.190
Now, if the spacing had been
very much smaller,

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:22.969
if the spacing had been 0.025
kcal/mole,

00:47:22.969 --> 00:47:25.972
then we would've made -- how
much is there of this that's in

00:47:25.972 --> 00:47:30.460
the lowest level;
how much has one unit, 0.025;

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.840
how much has 0.05,0.075,
and so on?

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.510
And we do exactly the same
trick;

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:39.467
although of course you need a
spreadsheet to do this with,

00:47:39.467 --> 00:47:40.925
because it's tedious.
 

00:47:40.925 --> 00:47:41.550
Right?
 

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:42.650
But you would get this.
 

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:46.889
And you see you absorb more
heat if you have smaller steps.

00:47:46.889 --> 00:47:52.306
And now there's 4.2% here,
and 0.8% at exactly 1

00:47:52.306 --> 00:47:53.690
kcal/mole.
 

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:56.320
But you have a lot of others in
here.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:01.199
So 59% of the population is
halfway out to the one;

00:48:01.199 --> 00:48:05.699
and then 33% is more or less
one;

00:48:05.699 --> 00:48:09.460
and 6.6% is like that;
and so on.

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.989
So anyhow, you absorb more heat.
 

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:15.702
And you absorb it at lower
temperature too.

00:48:15.702 --> 00:48:16.409
Right?
 

00:48:16.409 --> 00:48:18.429
So both those things build up
the entropy.

00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:22.282
So that one absorbs 364
kcal/mole more -- not

00:48:22.282 --> 00:48:26.134
kilocalories,
small calories -- 364 more than

00:48:26.134 --> 00:48:27.710
the other one.
 

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:32.110
And that is what gives that
entropy difference.

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:36.128
Okay, so that's how people knew
that there was a barrier to

00:48:36.128 --> 00:48:39.110
rotation, was by measuring heat
capacity.

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:43.404
So we'll stop here,
and next time we'll address the

00:48:43.404 --> 00:48:47.132
question of whether the --
now we know what the barrier

00:48:47.132 --> 00:48:49.590
is, but we don't know what the
low energy form is,

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:51.179
whether it's eclipsed or
staggered.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:12.800
Professor Paul Bloom:
Okay.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.060
The last class we talked about
the brain.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.866
Now we're going to talk a
little bit about some

00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:21.693
foundations.
So today and Monday we're going

00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:27.641
to talk about two very big ideas
and these ideas are associated

00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:30.231
with Sigmund Freud and B.
F.

00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:35.220
Skinner and are psychoanalysis
and behaviorism.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.773
And I want to talk about
psychoanalysis today and

00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:42.597
behaviorism next week.
Now, one of these things--One

00:00:42.597 --> 00:00:46.974
of the things that makes these
theories so interesting is their

00:00:46.974 --> 00:00:49.437
scope.
Most of the work we're going to

00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:52.740
talk about in this class--Most
of the ideas are narrow.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.296
So, we're going to talk about
somebody's idea about racial

00:00:56.296 --> 00:01:00.039
prejudice but that's not a
theory of language acquisition.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.746
We'll talk about theories of
schizophrenia but they're not

00:01:04.746 --> 00:01:08.049
explanations of sexual
attractiveness.

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.781
Most theories are specialized
theories but these two views are

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.758
grand theories.
They're theories of everything,

00:01:15.758 --> 00:01:18.379
encompassing just about
everything that matters,

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:20.689
day-to-day life,
child development,

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.658
mental illness,
religion, war,

00:01:22.658 --> 00:01:24.764
love.
Freud and Skinner had

00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:28.995
explanations of all of these.
Now, this is not a history

00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:30.889
course.
I have zero interest in

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:34.311
describing historical figures in
psychology just for the sake of

00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:36.810
telling you about the history of
the field.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.871
What I want to tell you about
though is--I want to talk about

00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:44.120
these ideas because so much
rests on them and,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.626
even more importantly,
a lot of these ideas have

00:01:47.626 --> 00:01:51.730
critical influence on how we
think about the present.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.949
And that's there.
Now, for better or worse,

00:01:58.949 --> 00:02:03.370
we live in a world profoundly
affected by Sigmund Freud.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.887
If I had to ask you to choose
a--no, name a famous

00:02:06.887 --> 00:02:10.046
psychologist,
the answer of most of you would

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:12.378
be Freud.
He's the most famous

00:02:12.378 --> 00:02:16.363
psychologist ever and he's had a
profound influence on the

00:02:16.363 --> 00:02:19.020
twentieth and twenty-first
century.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.310
Some biographical information:
He was born in the 1850s.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.836
He spent most of his life in
Vienna, Austria,

00:02:26.836 --> 00:02:31.325
but he died in London and he
escaped to London soon after

00:02:31.325 --> 00:02:35.733
retreating there at the
beginning of World War II as the

00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:39.180
Nazis began to occupy where he
lived.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.378
He's one of the most famous
scholars ever but he's not known

00:02:43.378 --> 00:02:47.177
for any single discovery.
Instead, he's known for the

00:02:47.177 --> 00:02:50.305
development of an encompassing
theory of mind,

00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:54.129
one that he developed over the
span of many decades.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.610
He was in his time extremely
well known, a celebrity

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.159
recognized on the street,
and throughout his life.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.541
He was a man of extraordinary
energy and productivity,

00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:07.859
in part because he was a very
serious cocaine addict,

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.305
but also just in general.
He was just a high-energy sort

00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:13.944
of person.
He was up for the Nobel Prize

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:17.770
in medicine and in literature;
didn't get either one of them;

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.524
didn't get the prize in
medicine because Albert

00:03:20.524 --> 00:03:23.159
Einstein--Everybody loves Albert
Einstein.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.909
Well, Albert Einstein really
wrote a letter because they

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.060
asked for opinions of other
Nobel Prizes.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.840
He wrote a letter saying,
"Don't give the prize to Freud.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.730
He doesn't deserve a Nobel
Prize.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.470
He's just a psychologist."
Well, yeah.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.399
Okay.
While he's almost universally

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:45.532
acclaimed as a profoundly
important intellectual figure,

00:03:45.532 --> 00:03:49.139
he's also the object of
considerable dislike.

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.699
This is in part because of his
character.

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.889
He was not a very nice man in
many ways.

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.197
He was deeply ambitious to the
cause of promoting

00:03:57.197 --> 00:04:00.298
psychoanalysis,
to the cause of presenting his

00:04:00.298 --> 00:04:04.450
view and defending it,
and he was often dishonest,

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.908
extremely brutal to his
friends, and terrible to his

00:04:08.908 --> 00:04:11.250
enemies.
He was an interesting character.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.998
My favorite Freud story was as
he was leaving Europe during the

00:04:15.998 --> 00:04:19.410
rise of the Nazis,
as he was ready to go to

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.466
England from,
I think, either Germany or

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:26.620
Austria, he had to sign a letter
from the Gestapo.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.771
Gestapo agents intercepted him
and demanded he sign a letter

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:34.994
saying that at no point had he
been threatened or harassed by

00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:38.149
the Gestapo.
So he signs the letter and then

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:41.683
he writes underneath it,
"The Gestapo has not harmed me

00:04:41.683 --> 00:04:44.683
in any way.
In fact, I highly recommend the

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:48.430
Gestapo to everybody."
It's--He had a certain

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.470
aggression to him.
He was also--He's also

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.850
disliked, often hated,
because of his views.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.395
He was seen as a sexual
renegade out to destroy the

00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:04.649
conception of people as good and
rational and pure beings.

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:08.085
And when the Nazis rose to
power in the 1930s he was

00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:11.924
identified as a Jew who was
devoted to destroying the most

00:05:11.924 --> 00:05:15.089
sacred notions of Christianity
and to many,

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:19.259
to some extent,
many people see him this way.

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.437
And to some extent,
this accusation has some truth

00:05:23.437 --> 00:05:26.554
to it.
Freud made claims about people

00:05:26.554 --> 00:05:29.231
that many of us,
maybe most of us,

00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:32.130
would rather not know.
Well, okay.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.264
What did he say?
Well, if you ask somebody who

00:05:35.264 --> 00:05:39.059
doesn't like Freud what he said,
they'll describe some of the

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:43.244
stupider things he said and,
in fact, Freud said a lot of

00:05:43.244 --> 00:05:46.899
things, some of which were not
very rational.

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:50.564
For instance,
he's well known for his account

00:05:50.564 --> 00:05:54.562
of phallic symbols,
arguing certain architectural

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:58.477
monuments are subconsciously
developed as penile

00:05:58.477 --> 00:06:01.631
representations.
And related to this,

00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:04.870
he developed the notorious
theory of penis envy.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.585
And penis envy is an account of
a developmental state that every

00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:11.003
one of you who is female has
gone through,

00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:13.899
according to Freud.
And the idea is that you

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:17.812
discovered at some point in your
development that you lacked a

00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:20.363
penis.
This is not--This is a

00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:23.699
catastrophe.
And so, each of you inferred at

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.500
that point that you had been
castrated.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.009
You had once had a penis but
somebody had taken it from you.

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:36.409
You then turn to your father
and love your father because

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:40.101
your father has a penis,
so he's a sort of penis

00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:43.457
substitute.
You reject your mother,

00:06:43.457 --> 00:06:47.621
who's equally unworthy due to
her penis lack,

00:06:47.621 --> 00:06:52.259
and that shapes your
psychosexual development.

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:55.013
Now, if that's the sort of
thing you know about Freud,

00:06:55.013 --> 00:06:57.974
you are not going to have a
very high opinion of him or of

00:06:57.974 --> 00:07:00.860
his work,
but at the core of Freud's

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.175
declamation, the more
interesting ideas,

00:07:04.175 --> 00:07:09.020
is a set of claims of a man's
intellectual importance.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.875
And the two main ones are this.
The two main ones involve the

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:16.759
existence of an unconscious,
unconscious motivation,

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:20.737
and the notion of unconscious
dynamics or unconscious conflict

00:07:20.737 --> 00:07:25.484
which lead to mental illnesses,
dreams, slips of the tongue and

00:07:25.484 --> 00:07:28.628
so on.
The first idea – the idea of

00:07:28.628 --> 00:07:33.234
unconscious motivation –
involves rejecting the claim

00:07:33.234 --> 00:07:37.828
that you know what you're doing.
So, suppose you fall in love

00:07:37.828 --> 00:07:41.218
with somebody and you decide you
want to marry them and then

00:07:41.218 --> 00:07:44.435
somebody was asked to ask you
why and you'd say something

00:07:44.435 --> 00:07:46.755
like,
"Well, I'm ready to get married

00:07:46.755 --> 00:07:49.220
this stage of my life;
I really love the person;

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.810
the person is smart and
attractive;

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:56.610
I want to have kids" whatever.
And maybe this is true.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.817
But a Freudian might say that
even if this is your honest

00:08:00.817 --> 00:08:04.949
answer – you're not lying to
anybody else –still,

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:08.666
there are desires and
motivations that govern your

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:11.699
behavior that you may not be
aware of.

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:14.981
So, in fact,
you might want to marry John

00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:19.822
because he reminds you of your
father or because you want to

00:08:19.822 --> 00:08:23.350
get back at somebody for
betraying you.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.999
If somebody was to tell you
this, you'd say,

00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:29.819
"That's total nonsense," but
that wouldn't deter a Freudian.

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:32.493
The Freudian would say that
these processes are unconscious

00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:34.889
so of course you just don't know
what's happening.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:39.656
So, the radical idea here is
you might not know what--why you

00:08:39.656 --> 00:08:44.105
do what you do and this is
something we accept for things

00:08:44.105 --> 00:08:47.718
like visual perception.
We accept that you look around

00:08:47.718 --> 00:08:50.704
the world and you get sensations
and you figure out there is a

00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:52.809
car, there is a tree,
there is a person.

00:08:52.809 --> 00:08:55.990
And you're just unconscious of
how this happens but it's

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.823
unpleasant and kind of
frightening that this could

00:08:58.823 --> 00:09:01.752
happen,
that this could apply to things

00:09:01.752 --> 00:09:06.263
like why you're now studying at
Yale, why you feel the way you

00:09:06.263 --> 00:09:10.279
do towards your friends,
towards your family.

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:14.261
Now, the marriage case is
extreme but Freud gives a lot of

00:09:14.261 --> 00:09:18.662
simpler examples where this sort
of unconscious motivation might

00:09:18.662 --> 00:09:21.305
play a role.
So, have you ever liked

00:09:21.305 --> 00:09:24.289
somebody or disliked them and
not known why?

00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:27.950
Have you ever found yourself in
a situation where you're doing

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.610
something or you're arguing for
something or making a decision

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.490
for reasons that you can't fully
articulate?

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.726
Have you ever forgotten
somebody's name at exactly the

00:09:37.726 --> 00:09:39.894
wrong time?
Have you ever called out the

00:09:39.894 --> 00:09:41.710
wrong name in the throes of
passion?

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.409
This is all the Freudian
unconscious.

00:09:45.409 --> 00:09:48.124
The idea is that we do these
things--these things are

00:09:48.124 --> 00:09:51.570
explained in terms of cognitive
systems that we're not aware of.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.521
Now, all of this would be fine
if your unconscious was a

00:09:55.521 --> 00:09:59.651
reasonable, rational computer,
if your unconscious was really

00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:02.460
smart and looking out for your
best interest.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.580
But, according to Freud,
that's not the way it works.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.425
According to Freud,
there are three distinct

00:10:08.425 --> 00:10:12.064
processes going on in your head
and these are in violent

00:10:12.064 --> 00:10:15.694
internal conflict.
And the way you act and the way

00:10:15.694 --> 00:10:19.132
you think are products,
not of a singular rational

00:10:19.132 --> 00:10:22.500
being, but of a set of
conflicting creatures.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:28.167
And these three parts are the
id, the ego, and the superego

00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:33.779
and they emerge developmentally.
The id, according to Freud,

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:37.450
is present at birth.
It's the animal part of the

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.225
self.
It wants to eat,

00:10:39.225 --> 00:10:42.784
drink, pee, poop,
get warm, and have sexual

00:10:42.784 --> 00:10:47.250
satisfaction.
It is outrageously stupid.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.830
It works on what Freud called,
"The Pleasure Principle."

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.769
It wants pleasure and it wants
it now.

00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:58.970
And that's, according to Freud,
how a human begins – pure id.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.509
Freud had this wonderful
phrase, "polymorphous

00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:06.049
perversity," this pure desire
for pleasure.

00:11:06.049 --> 00:11:08.809
Now, unfortunately,
life doesn't work like that.

00:11:08.809 --> 00:11:13.388
What you want isn't always what
you get and this leads to a set

00:11:13.388 --> 00:11:17.818
of reactions to cope with the
fact that pleasure isn't always

00:11:17.818 --> 00:11:22.249
there when you want it either by
planning how to satisfy your

00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:25.720
desires or planning how to
suppress them.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.250
And this system is known as the
ego, or the self.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.820
And it works on the "Reality
Principle."

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.861
And it works on the principle
of trying to figure out how to

00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:42.236
make your way through the world,
how to satisfy your pleasures

00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:45.269
or, in some cases,
how to give up on them.

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:49.486
And the ego – the emergence
of the ego for Freud--symbolizes

00:11:49.486 --> 00:11:53.775
the origin of consciousness.
Finally, if this was all there

00:11:53.775 --> 00:11:57.394
it might be a simpler world,
but Freud had a third

00:11:57.394 --> 00:12:01.940
component, that of the superego.
And the superego is the

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.519
internalized rules of parents in
society.

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:07.562
So, what happens in the course
of development is,

00:12:07.562 --> 00:12:09.946
you're just trying to make your
way through the world and

00:12:09.946 --> 00:12:13.144
satisfy your desires,
but sometimes you're punished

00:12:13.144 --> 00:12:15.937
for them.
Some desires are inappropriate,

00:12:15.937 --> 00:12:19.390
some actions are wrong,
and you're punished for it.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.482
The idea is that you come out;
you get in your head a

00:12:23.482 --> 00:12:26.825
superego, a conscience.
In these movies,

00:12:26.825 --> 00:12:31.043
there'd be a little angel above
your head that tells you when

00:12:31.043 --> 00:12:34.796
things are wrong.
And basically your self,

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:39.490
the ego, is in between the id
and the superego.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.346
One thing to realize,
I told you the id is

00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:44.771
outrageously stupid.
It just says,

00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:46.553
"Oh, hungry,
food, sex, oh,

00:12:46.553 --> 00:12:48.130
let's get warm,
oh."

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.924
The superego is also stupid.
The superego,

00:12:52.924 --> 00:12:55.202
point to point,
is not some brilliant moral

00:12:55.202 --> 00:12:57.860
philosopher telling you about
right and wrong.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.918
The superego would say,
"You should be ashamed of

00:12:59.918 --> 00:13:01.430
yourself.
That's disgusting.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.799
Stop doing that.
Oh."

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:06.447
And in between these two
screaming creatures,

00:13:06.447 --> 00:13:09.031
one of you;
one of them telling you to seek

00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:11.530
out your desires,
the other one telling you,

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.030
"you should be ashamed of
yourself," is you,

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.739
is the ego.
Now, according to Freud,

00:13:16.739 --> 00:13:21.649
most of this is unconscious.
So, we see bubbling up to the

00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:25.360
top, we feel,
we experience ourselves.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.938
And the driving of the id,
the forces of the id and the

00:13:28.938 --> 00:13:32.185
forces of the superego,
are unconscious in that we

00:13:32.185 --> 00:13:36.022
cannot access them.
We don't know what--It's like

00:13:36.022 --> 00:13:39.610
the workings of our kidneys or
our stomachs.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.870
You can't introspect and find
them.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:47.040
Rather, they do their work
without conscious knowledge.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.309
Now, Freud developed this.
This is the Freudian theory in

00:13:51.309 --> 00:13:54.861
broad outline.
He extended it and developed it

00:13:54.861 --> 00:13:58.360
into a theory of psychosexual
development.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.243
And so, Freud's theory is,
as I said before,

00:14:01.243 --> 00:14:04.059
a theory of everyday life,
of decisions,

00:14:04.059 --> 00:14:08.403
of errors, of falling in love,
but it's also a theory of child

00:14:08.403 --> 00:14:11.825
development.
So, Freud believed there were

00:14:11.825 --> 00:14:16.008
five stages of personality
development, and each is

00:14:16.008 --> 00:14:19.940
associated with a particular
erogenous zone.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.040
And Freud believed,
as well, that if you have a

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.477
problem at a certain stage,
if something goes wrong,

00:14:26.477 --> 00:14:29.354
you'll be stuck there.
So, according to Freud,

00:14:29.354 --> 00:14:32.190
there are people in this room
who are what they are because

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.830
they got stuck in the oral stage
or the anal stage.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:40.412
And that's not good.
So, the oral stage is when you

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:42.844
start off.
The mouth is associated with

00:14:42.844 --> 00:14:45.319
pleasure.
Everything is sucking and

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:49.144
chewing and so on.
And the problem for Freud is

00:14:49.144 --> 00:14:53.803
premature weaning of a child.
Depriving him of the breast,

00:14:53.803 --> 00:14:58.490
could lead to serious problems
in his personality development.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.813
It could make him,
as the phrase goes,

00:15:01.813 --> 00:15:05.950
into an oral person.
And his orality could be

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:10.163
described literally.
Freud uses it as an explanation

00:15:10.163 --> 00:15:14.509
for why somebody might eat too
much or chew gum or smoke.

00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:17.984
They're trying to achieve
satisfaction through their mouth

00:15:17.984 --> 00:15:21.154
of a sort they didn't get in
this very early stage of

00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:23.551
development.
But it can also be more

00:15:23.551 --> 00:15:26.247
abstract.
If your roommate is dependent

00:15:26.247 --> 00:15:30.045
and needy, you could then go to
your roommate and say,

00:15:30.045 --> 00:15:35.231
"You are an oral person.
The first year of your life did

00:15:35.231 --> 00:15:38.873
not go well."
A phrase even more popular is

00:15:38.873 --> 00:15:42.919
the anal stage and that happens
after the oral stage.

00:15:42.919 --> 00:15:48.091
And problems can emerge if
toilet training is not handled

00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:50.791
correctly.
If you have problems during

00:15:50.791 --> 00:15:53.385
those years of life,
you could become an anal

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:55.538
personality,
according to Freud,

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:59.209
and your roommate could say,
"Your problem is you're too

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.181
anal."
And, according to Freud,

00:16:01.181 --> 00:16:04.495
literally, it meant you are
unwilling to part with your own

00:16:04.495 --> 00:16:05.010
feces.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.990
It's written down here.
I know it's true.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.226
And the way it manifests
itself, as you know from just

00:16:14.226 --> 00:16:16.485
how people talk,
is you're compulsive,

00:16:16.485 --> 00:16:18.440
you're clean,
you're stingy.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.911
This is the anal personality.
Then it gets a little bit more

00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:25.475
complicated.
The next stage is the phallic

00:16:25.475 --> 00:16:27.025
stage.
Actually, this is not much more

00:16:27.025 --> 00:16:30.642
complicated.
The focus of pleasure shifts to

00:16:30.642 --> 00:16:36.807
the genitals and fixation can
lead to excessive masculinity in

00:16:36.807 --> 00:16:43.073
females or in males or if you're
female a need for attention or

00:16:43.073 --> 00:16:46.752
domination.
Now, at this point something

00:16:46.752 --> 00:16:50.950
really interesting happens
called the "Oedipus Complex."

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:55.319
And this is based on the story,
the mythical story of a king

00:16:55.319 --> 00:16:58.799
who killed his father and
married his mother.

00:16:58.799 --> 00:17:03.735
And, according to Freud,
this happens to all of us in

00:17:03.735 --> 00:17:05.539
this way.
Well, all of us.

00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:09.620
By "all of us," Freud meant
"men."

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.890
So, here's the idea.
You're three or four years old.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.099
You're in the phallic stage.
So, what are you interested in?

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:21.781
Well, you're interested in your
penis and then you seek an

00:17:21.781 --> 00:17:24.765
external object.
Freud's sort of vague about

00:17:24.765 --> 00:17:27.329
this, but you seek some sort of
satisfaction.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.892
But who is out there who'd be
sweet and kind and loving and

00:17:30.892 --> 00:17:35.319
wonderful?
Well, Mom.

00:17:35.319 --> 00:17:39.666
So the child infers,
"Mom is nice,

00:17:39.666 --> 00:17:43.765
I love Mom."
So far so--And so this is not

00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:46.612
crazy;
a little boy falling in love

00:17:46.612 --> 00:17:51.019
with his mother.
Problem: Dad's in the way.

00:17:51.019 --> 00:17:55.527
Now, this is going to get
progressively weirder but I will

00:17:55.527 --> 00:17:58.769
have to say, as the father of
two sons,

00:17:58.769 --> 00:18:02.121
both sons went through a phase
where they explicitly said they

00:18:02.121 --> 00:18:04.771
wanted to marry Mommy.
And me – if something bad

00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:07.830
happened to me that wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:13.148
So, there's this.
But now it gets a little bit

00:18:13.148 --> 00:18:16.040
aggressive.
So, the idea is the child

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.180
determines that he's going to
kill his father.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.309
Every three- and four-year-old
boy thinks this.

00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:25.606
But then because children,
according to Freud,

00:18:25.606 --> 00:18:30.074
don't have a good sense of the
boundary between their mind and

00:18:30.074 --> 00:18:32.886
the world,
which is a problem – the

00:18:32.886 --> 00:18:37.146
problem is they don't – they
think their father can tell that

00:18:37.146 --> 00:18:41.474
they're plotting to kill him and
they figure their father is now

00:18:41.474 --> 00:18:44.269
angry at them.
And then they ask themselves,

00:18:44.269 --> 00:18:46.580
"What's the worst thing Dad
could do to me?"

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:53.715
And the answer is castration.
So, they come to the conclusion

00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:57.702
that their father is going to
castrate them because of their

00:18:57.702 --> 00:19:00.950
illicit love for their Mom.
And then they say,

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:04.814
"Dad wins" and then they don't
think about sex for several

00:19:04.814 --> 00:19:07.390
years and that's the latency
stage.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.540
The latency stage is they've
gone through this huge thing

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.960
with Mom and Dad,
"fell in love with Mom,

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.792
wanted to kill my father,
Dad was going to castrate me,

00:19:16.792 --> 00:19:20.539
fell out of love with Mom,
out of the sex business."

00:19:20.539 --> 00:19:23.100
And then, sex is repressed
until you get to the genital

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.894
stage.
And the genital stage is the

00:19:25.894 --> 00:19:30.119
stage we are all in – the
healthy adult stage.

00:19:30.119 --> 00:19:34.221
Now that you're adults and
you've gone through all the

00:19:34.221 --> 00:19:37.549
developmental stages,
where do you stand?

00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:42.161
You're not out of the woods yet
because unconscious mechanisms

00:19:42.161 --> 00:19:46.470
are still--Even if you haven't
got fixated on anything,

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.814
there's still this dynamic
going on all the time with your

00:19:50.814 --> 00:19:54.822
id, your ego and your superego.
And the idea is your

00:19:54.822 --> 00:19:58.180
superego--Remember,
your superego is stupid.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:02.771
So, your superego isn't only
telling you not to do bad

00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:07.190
things, it's telling you not to
think bad things.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.318
So, what's happening is your id
is sending up all of this weird,

00:20:11.318 --> 00:20:15.052
sick stuff, all of these crazy
sexual and violent desires,

00:20:15.052 --> 00:20:18.730
"Oh, I'll kill him.
I'll have sex with that.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:23.339
I'll have extra helpings on my
dessert."

00:20:23.339 --> 00:20:28.440
And your superego is saying,
"No, no, no."

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.848
And this stuff is repressed.
It doesn't even make it to

00:20:31.848 --> 00:20:34.885
consciousness.
The problem is Freud had a very

00:20:34.885 --> 00:20:39.497
sort of hydraulic theory of what
goes on and some of this stuff

00:20:39.497 --> 00:20:43.886
slips out and it shows up in
dreams and it shows up in slips

00:20:43.886 --> 00:20:46.923
of the tongue.
And in exceptional cases,

00:20:46.923 --> 00:20:49.650
it shows up in certain clinical
symptoms.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.640
So what happens is,
Freud described a lot of normal

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.349
life in terms of different ways
we use to keep that horrible

00:20:58.349 --> 00:21:02.660
stuff from the id making its way
to consciousness.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.609
And he called these "defense
mechanisms."

00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:10.116
You're defending yourself
against the horrible parts of

00:21:10.116 --> 00:21:14.789
yourself and some of these make
a little bit of sense.

00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:17.272
One way to describe this in a
non-technical,

00:21:17.272 --> 00:21:20.159
non-Freudian way is,
there are certain things about

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:23.804
ourselves we'd rather not know.
There are certain desires we'd

00:21:23.804 --> 00:21:26.349
rather not know and we have ways
to hide them.

00:21:26.349 --> 00:21:28.650
So, for instance,
there's sublimation.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.846
Sublimation is you might have a
lot of energy,

00:21:31.846 --> 00:21:34.900
maybe sexual energy or
aggressive energy,

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.454
but instead of turning it to a
sexual or aggressive target what

00:21:38.454 --> 00:21:40.920
you do is you focus it in some
other way.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.552
So, you can imagine a great
artist like Picasso turning the

00:21:44.552 --> 00:21:52.089
sexual energy into his artwork.
There is displacement.

00:21:52.089 --> 00:21:55.882
Displacement is you have
certain shameful thoughts or

00:21:55.882 --> 00:21:59.529
desires and you refocus them
more appropriately.

00:21:59.529 --> 00:22:03.605
A boy who's bullied by his
father may hate his father and

00:22:03.605 --> 00:22:08.191
want to hurt him but since this
would--this is very shameful and

00:22:08.191 --> 00:22:10.927
difficult.
The boy might instead kick the

00:22:10.927 --> 00:22:14.477
dog and think he hates the dog
because that's a more acceptable

00:22:14.477 --> 00:22:15.050
target.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.549
There is projection.
Projection is,

00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:28.938
I have certain impulses I am
uncomfortable with,

00:22:28.938 --> 00:22:33.048
so rather than own them myself,
I project them to somebody

00:22:33.048 --> 00:22:36.182
else.
A classic example for Freud is

00:22:36.182 --> 00:22:39.724
homosexual desires.
The idea is that I feel this

00:22:39.724 --> 00:22:42.557
tremendous lust towards you,
for instance,

00:22:42.557 --> 00:22:46.143
and--any of you,
all of you, you three,

00:22:46.143 --> 00:22:50.793
and I'm ashamed of this lust so
what I say is,

00:22:50.793 --> 00:22:53.223
"Hey.
Are you guys looking at me in a

00:22:53.223 --> 00:22:55.700
sexual manner?
Are you lusting after me?

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.163
How disgusting," because what I
do is I take my own desires and

00:22:59.163 --> 00:23:01.860
I project it to others.
And Freud suggested,

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.112
perhaps not implausibly,
that men who believe other

00:23:05.112 --> 00:23:08.819
men--who are obsessed with the
sexuality of other men,

00:23:08.819 --> 00:23:12.890
are themselves projecting away
their own sexual desires.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.408
There is rationalization,
which is that when you do

00:23:16.408 --> 00:23:20.842
something or think something bad
you rationalize it and you give

00:23:20.842 --> 00:23:24.079
it a more socially acceptable
explanation.

00:23:24.079 --> 00:23:28.578
A parent who enjoys smacking
his child will typically not

00:23:28.578 --> 00:23:31.390
say, "I enjoy smacking my
child."

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.650
Rather he'll say,
"It's for the child's own good.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.539
I'm being a good parent by
doing this."

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:37.529
And finally,
there is regression,

00:23:37.529 --> 00:23:41.009
which is returning to an
earlier stage of development.

00:23:41.009 --> 00:23:42.630
And you actually see this in
children.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:47.159
In times of stress and trauma,
they'll become younger,

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:50.049
they will act younger.
They might cry.

00:23:50.049 --> 00:23:53.480
They might suck their thumb,
seek out a blanket or so on.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.956
Now, these are all mechanisms
that for Freud are not the

00:23:56.956 --> 00:24:00.599
slightest bit pathological.
They are part of normal life.

00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:05.127
Normally, we do these things to
keep an equilibrium among the

00:24:05.127 --> 00:24:09.127
different systems of the
unconscious, but sometimes it

00:24:09.127 --> 00:24:13.051
doesn't work.
Sometimes things go awry and

00:24:13.051 --> 00:24:18.996
what happens is a phrase that's
not currently used in psychology

00:24:18.996 --> 00:24:23.619
but was popular during Freud's
time: hysteria.

00:24:23.619 --> 00:24:27.087
Hysteria includes phenomena
like hysterical blindness and

00:24:27.087 --> 00:24:29.845
hysterical deafness,
which is when you cannot see

00:24:29.845 --> 00:24:32.735
and cannot hear even though
there's nothing physiologically

00:24:32.735 --> 00:24:36.333
wrong with you – paralysis,
trembling, panic attacks,

00:24:36.333 --> 00:24:39.859
gaps of memory including
amnesia and so on.

00:24:39.859 --> 00:24:43.029
And the idea is that these are
actually symptoms.

00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:46.772
These are symptoms of
mechanisms going on to keep

00:24:46.772 --> 00:24:51.513
things unconscious.
It's a common enough idea in

00:24:51.513 --> 00:24:53.697
movies.
Often in movies what happens is

00:24:53.697 --> 00:24:55.120
that somebody goes to an
analyst.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.430
They have some horrible problem.
They can't remember something

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.960
or they have some sort of
blackouts and so on.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.414
And the analyst tells them
something and at one point they

00:25:05.414 --> 00:25:09.322
get this insight and they
realize what--why they've

00:25:09.322 --> 00:25:12.667
blinded themselves,
why they can't remember,

00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:14.990
and for Freud this is what
happens.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:20.117
Freud originally attempted to
get these memories out through

00:25:20.117 --> 00:25:25.244
hypnosis but then moved to the
mechanism of free association

00:25:25.244 --> 00:25:27.739
and,
according to Freud,

00:25:27.739 --> 00:25:33.139
the idea is patients offer
resistance to this and then the

00:25:33.139 --> 00:25:38.917
idea of a psychoanalyst is to
get over the resistance and help

00:25:38.917 --> 00:25:43.347
patients get insight.
The key notion of

00:25:43.347 --> 00:25:50.175
psychoanalysis is your problems
are--actually reflect deeper

00:25:50.175 --> 00:25:53.618
phenomena.
You're hiding something from

00:25:53.618 --> 00:25:57.220
yourself, and once you know
what's going on to deeper

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.990
phenomena your problems will go
away.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.440
I'm going to give you an
example of a therapy session.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.250
Now, this is not a Freudian
analysis.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.451
We'll discuss later on in the
course what a Freudian analysis

00:26:09.451 --> 00:26:11.960
is, but this is not a pure
Freudian analysis.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.540
A Freudian analysis,
of course, is lying on a couch;

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.819
does not see their therapist;
their therapist is very

00:26:17.819 --> 00:26:20.703
nondirective.
But I'm going to present this

00:26:20.703 --> 00:26:24.521
as an example here because it
illustrates so many of the

00:26:24.521 --> 00:26:27.484
Freudian themes,
particularly themes about

00:26:27.484 --> 00:26:30.971
dreams, the importance of
dreams, about repression and

00:26:30.971 --> 00:26:34.371
about hidden meaning.
So, this is from a television

00:26:34.371 --> 00:26:37.198
episode and the
character's--Many--Some of you

00:26:37.198 --> 00:26:40.019
may have seen this.
Many of you will not have.

00:26:40.019 --> 00:26:42.390
The character is suffering from
panic attacks.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:19.283
Freud's contributions extend
beyond the study of individual

00:27:19.283 --> 00:27:22.259
psychology and individual
pathology.

00:27:22.259 --> 00:27:26.102
Freud had a lot to say about
dreams as you could see in this

00:27:26.102 --> 00:27:29.897
illustration.
He believed that dreams had a

00:27:29.897 --> 00:27:32.519
manifest content,
meaning;

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:35.509
"manifest" meaning what you
experience in your dream.

00:27:35.509 --> 00:27:38.829
But dreams always had a latent
content as well,

00:27:38.829 --> 00:27:42.150
meaning the hidden implication
of the dream.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.220
He viewed all dreams as wish
fulfillment.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.440
Every dream you have is a
certain wish you have even

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.052
though it might be a forbidden
wish that you wouldn't wish to

00:27:50.052 --> 00:27:53.788
have, you wouldn't want to have.
And dreams had--and this is an

00:27:53.788 --> 00:27:57.970
idea that long predated Freud.
Dreams had symbolism.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:02.066
Things in dreams were often not
what they seemed to be but

00:28:02.066 --> 00:28:07.658
rather symbols for other things.
Freud believed that literature

00:28:07.658 --> 00:28:13.851
and fairy tales and stories to
children and the like carried

00:28:13.851 --> 00:28:18.973
certain universal themes,
certain aspects of unconscious

00:28:18.973 --> 00:28:22.104
struggles, and certain
preoccupations of our

00:28:22.104 --> 00:28:25.522
unconscious mind.
And Freud had a lot to say

00:28:25.522 --> 00:28:27.926
about religion.
For instance,

00:28:27.926 --> 00:28:32.895
he viewed a large part of
our--of the idea of finding a

00:28:32.895 --> 00:28:36.526
singular,
all-powerful god as seeking out

00:28:36.526 --> 00:28:41.579
a father figure that some of us
never had during development.

00:28:41.579 --> 00:28:45.016
What I want to spend the rest
of the class on is the

00:28:45.016 --> 00:28:48.801
scientific assessment of Freud.
So, what I did so far is I've

00:28:48.801 --> 00:28:51.440
told you what Freud had to say
in broad outline.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.002
I then want to take the time to
consider whether or not we

00:28:55.002 --> 00:28:59.190
should believe this and how well
it fits with our modern science.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.022
But before doing so,
I'll take questions for a few

00:29:02.022 --> 00:29:04.275
minutes.
Do people have any questions

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:06.250
about Freud or Freud's theories?

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:14.622
Yes.
Student:

00:29:14.622 --> 00:29:18.631
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:22.791
So, that's some question.
The question is:

00:29:22.791 --> 00:29:27.675
The conflicts in psychosexual
development that Freud describes

00:29:27.675 --> 00:29:32.559
is--always assumes that a child
has a mother and a father,

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:34.857
one of each,
in a certain sort of familial

00:29:34.857 --> 00:29:37.302
structure.
And the question then is,

00:29:37.302 --> 00:29:40.565
"What if a child was raised by
a single parent,

00:29:40.565 --> 00:29:42.982
for example?"
What if a child was never

00:29:42.982 --> 00:29:45.650
breast fed, but fed from the
bottle from the start?

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.380
And Freudians have had problems
with this.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:54.690
Freud's--Freud was very focused
on the family life of the people

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.857
he interacted with,
which is rather upper class

00:29:57.857 --> 00:30:00.601
Europeans, and these sort of
questions would have been

00:30:00.601 --> 00:30:03.829
difficult for Freud to answer.
I imagine that what a Freudian

00:30:03.829 --> 00:30:06.260
would have to say is,
you would expect systematic

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.487
differences.
So, you would expect a child

00:30:08.487 --> 00:30:11.264
who just grew up with a mother
or just grew up to be a

00:30:11.264 --> 00:30:14.199
father--with a father to be in
some sense psychologically

00:30:14.199 --> 00:30:17.271
damaged by that,
failing to go through the

00:30:17.271 --> 00:30:21.569
normal psychosexual stages.
Yes.

00:30:21.569 --> 00:30:24.043
Student:
[inaudible]

00:30:24.043 --> 00:30:29.559
Professor Paul Bloom:
The issue--The question is,

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:34.003
"Do modern psychoanalysts still
believe that women do not have

00:30:34.003 --> 00:30:37.097
superegos?"
Freud was--As you're pointing

00:30:37.097 --> 00:30:41.319
out, Freud was notorious for
pointing, for suggesting that

00:30:41.319 --> 00:30:44.799
women were morally immature
relative to men.

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:47.596
I think Freud would say that
women have superegos,

00:30:47.596 --> 00:30:50.849
they're just not the sort of
sturdy ones that men have.

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:54.229
I think psychoanalysts and
psychoanalytic scholars right

00:30:54.229 --> 00:30:56.843
now would be mixed.
Some would maintain that there

00:30:56.843 --> 00:30:59.688
really are deep sex differences.
Others would want to jettison

00:30:59.688 --> 00:31:01.220
that aspect of Freudian theory.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.128
Yes.
Student:

00:31:08.128 --> 00:31:10.539
Do you define sublimation as
being displacement?

00:31:10.539 --> 00:31:14.680
Does that make it sort of a
subgroup of displacement?

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.938
Professor Paul Bloom:
Well, what sublimation is--A

00:31:16.938 --> 00:31:18.430
lot of these--It's a good
question.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.130
The question is sort of,
what is sublimation?

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.480
How does it relate to the other
defense mechanisms?

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:28.452
A lot of defense mechanisms
involve taking a desire and

00:31:28.452 --> 00:31:32.620
turning it.
Now, what displacement does is

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.605
it takes it from you to her.
I'm angry at you but maybe

00:31:36.605 --> 00:31:39.660
that's forbidden for some
reason, so I'll be angry at her.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.803
What projection does is takes a
desire from me and then puts it

00:31:43.803 --> 00:31:46.210
on somebody else heading
outwards.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:50.288
And what sublimation does is it
just gives up the details and

00:31:50.288 --> 00:31:53.400
keeps the energy.
So, you stay up--Your roommate

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.859
stays up all night working and
you say to your roommate,

00:31:56.859 --> 00:31:58.900
for instance,
"That's just because you

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.263
haven't had sex in a long time
and you want to have sex so you

00:32:02.263 --> 00:32:04.799
devote all your energy to your
math exam."

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:07.940
And then you say,
"That's sublimation.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:12.657
I learned that in Intro Psych."
And your roommate would be very

00:32:12.657 --> 00:32:14.690
pleased.
One more question.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.536
Yes.
Student:

00:32:26.536 --> 00:32:30.630
What kind of evidence is there
for cross-cultural variation?

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.402
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question is,

00:32:32.402 --> 00:32:34.496
which is related to the
issue--extending the issue of

00:32:34.496 --> 00:32:36.390
the two-parent versus one-parent
family is,

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.998
"To what extent are these
notions validated

00:32:38.998 --> 00:32:41.485
cross-culturally?"
And that's such a good question

00:32:41.485 --> 00:32:43.956
I'm going to defer it.
I'm going to talk about it in a

00:32:43.956 --> 00:32:46.651
few minutes because that's
actually--That speaks to the

00:32:46.651 --> 00:32:49.395
issue of the scientific
assessment of Freud so I'm going

00:32:49.395 --> 00:32:51.990
to try to get to your question
in a little bit.

00:32:55.839 --> 00:33:00.101
Freudian theory is now,
at this point of time,

00:33:00.101 --> 00:33:05.310
extremely controversial and
there is a lot of well-known

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:10.272
criticisms and attacks on Freud.
This is just actually an

00:33:10.272 --> 00:33:14.220
excellent book on The Memory
Wars by Frederick Crews,

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.227
which--and Frederick Crews is
one of the strongest and most

00:33:18.227 --> 00:33:24.653
passionate critics of Freud.
And the problems with Freud go

00:33:24.653 --> 00:33:28.645
like this.
There are two ways you could

00:33:28.645 --> 00:33:31.705
reject a theory.
There are two problems with the

00:33:31.705 --> 00:33:34.904
scientific theory.
One way you could reject a

00:33:34.904 --> 00:33:37.799
theory is that it could be
wrong.

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:40.897
So, suppose I have a theory
that the reason why some

00:33:40.897 --> 00:33:43.630
children have autism,
a profound developmental

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.913
disorder,
is because their mothers don't

00:33:45.913 --> 00:33:48.924
love them enough.
This was a popular theory for

00:33:48.924 --> 00:33:52.369
many years.
It's a possible theory.

00:33:52.369 --> 00:33:57.288
It just turns out to be wrong
but another way--And so one way

00:33:57.288 --> 00:34:01.715
to attack and address a
scientific theory is to view it

00:34:01.715 --> 00:34:05.240
as just to see whether or not it
works.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.329
But there's a different problem
a theory could have.

00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:14.836
A theory could be so vague and
all encompassing that it can't

00:34:14.836 --> 00:34:18.736
even be tested.
And this is one of the main

00:34:18.736 --> 00:34:22.667
critiques of Freud.
The idea could be summed up by

00:34:22.667 --> 00:34:26.440
a quotation from the physicist
Wolfgang Pauli.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.400
And Pauli was asked his opinion
about another physicist.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:35.290
And Pauli said this:
"That guy's work is crap.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:39.420
He's not right.
He's not even wrong."

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:44.789
And the criticism about Freud
is that he's not even wrong.

00:34:44.789 --> 00:34:49.684
The issue of vagueness is
summarized in a more technical

00:34:49.684 --> 00:34:54.312
way by the philosopher Karl
Popper who described--who

00:34:54.312 --> 00:34:58.050
introduced the term of
falsifiability.

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:03.233
The idea of falsifiability is
that what distinguishes science

00:35:03.233 --> 00:35:07.639
from non science is that
scientific predictions make

00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:12.737
strong claims about the world
and these claims are of a sort

00:35:12.737 --> 00:35:17.343
that they could be proven wrong.
If they couldn't be proven

00:35:17.343 --> 00:35:20.039
wrong, they're not interesting
enough to be science.

00:35:20.039 --> 00:35:22.366
So, for example,
within psychology the sort of

00:35:22.366 --> 00:35:25.312
claims we'll be entertaining
throughout the course include

00:35:25.312 --> 00:35:27.925
claims like,
damage to the hippocampus

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:32.423
causes failures of certain sorts
of memory, or everywhere in the

00:35:32.423 --> 00:35:36.564
world men on average want to
have more sexual partners than

00:35:36.564 --> 00:35:38.838
women,
or exposure to violent

00:35:38.838 --> 00:35:42.085
television tends to make
children themselves more

00:35:42.085 --> 00:35:45.084
violent.
Now, are they true or are they

00:35:45.084 --> 00:35:47.423
false?
Well, we'll talk about that,

00:35:47.423 --> 00:35:50.079
but the point here is they can
be false.

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:54.816
They're interesting enough that
they can be tested and as such

00:35:54.816 --> 00:35:59.553
they go to--they might be wrong
but they graduate to the level

00:35:59.553 --> 00:36:03.867
of a scientific theory.
This should be contrasted with

00:36:03.867 --> 00:36:08.376
nonscientific programs and the
best example of a nonscientific

00:36:08.376 --> 00:36:11.836
program is astrology.
So, the problem with

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:16.220
astrological predictions is not
that they're wrong.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.760
It's that they can't be wrong.
They're not even wrong.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:25.909
I did my--I got my horoscope
for today on the web.

00:36:25.909 --> 00:36:28.422
"A couple of negative aspects
could make you a little finicky

00:36:28.422 --> 00:36:30.240
for the next few days."
Okay.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.026
I'm going to watch for that.
"The presence of both Mars and

00:36:33.026 --> 00:36:35.329
Venus suggests you want to box
everything into a neat,

00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:38.207
ordered, structured way but
keeping a piece of jade or

00:36:38.207 --> 00:36:41.247
carnelian close will help you
keep in touch with your fun

00:36:41.247 --> 00:36:43.163
side."
And starting this morning I got

00:36:43.163 --> 00:36:45.867
from my wife a little piece of
jade and I have been sort of in

00:36:45.867 --> 00:36:47.791
touch with my fun side.
The problem is,

00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:50.260
a few days aren't going to go
by and say, "God.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.990
That was wrong."
It can't be wrong.

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:57.105
It's just so vague.
I got a better horoscope from

00:36:57.105 --> 00:37:01.026
The Onion actually:
"Riding in a golf cart with

00:37:01.026 --> 00:37:04.151
snow cone in hand,
you'll be tackled by two police

00:37:04.151 --> 00:37:06.940
officers this week after
matching a composite caricature

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:13.850
of a suspected murderer."
Now, that's a good prediction

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:18.076
because "wow."
If it turns out to be true,

00:37:18.076 --> 00:37:20.130
I'm going to say,
"Those guys really know

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:24.679
something."
It's falsifiable.

00:37:24.679 --> 00:37:30.205
Arguably, Freud fails the test
because Freudian theory is often

00:37:30.205 --> 00:37:35.374
so vague and flexible that it
can't really be tested in any

00:37:35.374 --> 00:37:38.393
reliable way.
A big problem with this is a

00:37:38.393 --> 00:37:41.346
lot of Freudian theory is
claimed to be validated in the

00:37:41.346 --> 00:37:44.028
course of psychoanalysis.
So, when you ask people,

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:46.116
"Why do you believe in Freud?"
they won't say,

00:37:46.116 --> 00:37:47.929
"Oh, because of this
experiment, that experiment,

00:37:47.929 --> 00:37:49.289
this data set and that data
set."

00:37:49.289 --> 00:37:51.907
What they'll say is,
"It's--The Freudian theory

00:37:51.907 --> 00:37:55.321
proves itself in the course of
psychoanalysis – the success

00:37:55.321 --> 00:37:58.840
of psychoanalysis."
But it's unreliable.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.950
The problem is,
say, Freud says to a patient,

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:03.680
"You hate your mother."
The patient says, "Wow.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.210
That makes sense."
Freud says, "I'm right."

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:09.757
The patient--Freud says,
"You hate your mother," and the

00:38:09.757 --> 00:38:11.100
patient says,
"No, I don't.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.409
That's titillating.
That's disgusting."

00:38:15.409 --> 00:38:16.998
Freud says, "Your anger shows
this idea is painful to you.

00:38:16.998 --> 00:38:18.113
You have repressed it from
consciousness.

00:38:18.113 --> 00:38:21.277
I am right."
And the problem is the same

00:38:21.277 --> 00:38:27.418
sort of dynamic plays itself out
even in the scientific debate

00:38:27.418 --> 00:38:30.231
back and forth.
So Freud--Freudian

00:38:30.231 --> 00:38:33.293
psychologists--I'm putting Freud
here but what I mean is

00:38:33.293 --> 00:38:36.410
well-known defenders of Freud
will make some claims like:

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:39.248
adult personality traits are
shaped by the course of

00:38:39.248 --> 00:38:42.369
psychosexual development;
all dreams are disguised wish

00:38:42.369 --> 00:38:44.077
fulfillment;
psychoanalysis is the best

00:38:44.077 --> 00:38:46.763
treatment for mental disorders.
Scientists will respond,

00:38:46.763 --> 00:38:48.497
"I disagree.
There's little or no evidence

00:38:48.497 --> 00:38:50.635
supporting those claims."
And the Freudian response is,

00:38:50.635 --> 00:38:53.087
"Your rejection of my ideas
shows that they are distressing

00:38:53.087 --> 00:38:55.659
to you.
This is because I am right."

00:38:55.659 --> 00:38:58.670
And this is often followed up,
seriously enough.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:02.650
"You have deep psychological
problems."

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:09.210
And now, I don't want to
caricature Freudians.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:13.976
A lot of Freudians have tried
and made a research program of

00:39:13.976 --> 00:39:16.884
extending their ideas
scientifically,

00:39:16.884 --> 00:39:20.519
bringing them to robust
scientific tests.

00:39:20.519 --> 00:39:23.687
But the problem is,
when you make specific

00:39:23.687 --> 00:39:28.090
falsifiable predictions they
don't always do that well.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:30.541
So, for instance,
there's no evidence that oral

00:39:30.541 --> 00:39:33.527
and anal characteristics,
the personality characteristics

00:39:33.527 --> 00:39:36.671
I talked about – about being
needy versus being stingy –

00:39:36.671 --> 00:39:40.190
relate in any interesting way to
weaning or toilet training.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:42.910
And there's been some efforts
cross-culturally,

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:46.282
to go back to the question this
young man asked before –

00:39:46.282 --> 00:39:49.535
looking at cross-cultural
differences in toilet training

00:39:49.535 --> 00:39:51.718
and weaning,
which are really big

00:39:51.718 --> 00:39:54.849
differences, to see if they
correspond in any interesting

00:39:54.849 --> 00:39:58.185
way to personality differences.
And there's been no good

00:39:58.185 --> 00:40:01.425
evidence supporting that.
Similarly, Freud had some

00:40:01.425 --> 00:40:04.999
strong claims about sexuality,
for why some people are

00:40:04.999 --> 00:40:10.245
straight and others are gay.
These have met with very little

00:40:10.245 --> 00:40:13.349
empirical support.
And the claim that

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:17.442
psychoanalysis proves itself by
being--by its tremendous success

00:40:17.442 --> 00:40:21.469
in curing mental illness is also
almost certainly not true.

00:40:21.469 --> 00:40:24.335
For most--Maybe not all,
but for most psychological

00:40:24.335 --> 00:40:27.831
disorders, there are quicker and
more reliable treatments than

00:40:27.831 --> 00:40:30.499
psychoanalysis.
And there's considerable

00:40:30.499 --> 00:40:34.579
controversy as to whether the
Tony Soprano method of insight,

00:40:34.579 --> 00:40:38.410
where you get this insight and
there's discovery,

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:42.960
"Oh, now I know," makes any
real difference in alleviating

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.190
symptoms such as anxiety
disorders or depression.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.888
This is why there's sort
of--often sort of a sticker

00:40:50.888 --> 00:40:55.021
shock when people go to a
university psychology department

00:40:55.021 --> 00:40:56.544
where they say,
"Look.

00:40:56.544 --> 00:40:58.349
Hey.
Where is--So I'm in Psych.

00:40:58.349 --> 00:41:00.440
How could I take classes on
Freud?

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:05.165
Who's your expert on Freud?"
And the truth is Freudian

00:41:05.165 --> 00:41:09.380
psychoanalysis is almost never
studied inside psychology

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.914
departments.
Not the cognitive or

00:41:11.914 --> 00:41:14.889
developmental side,
not the clinical side.

00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:17.919
There are some exceptions but,
for the most part,

00:41:17.919 --> 00:41:21.137
even the people who do study
Freud within psychology

00:41:21.137 --> 00:41:25.070
departments do so critically.
Very few of them would see

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:29.270
themselves as a psychoanalytic
practitioner or as a Freudian

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:32.186
psychologist.
Freud lives on both in a

00:41:32.186 --> 00:41:36.480
clinical setting and in the
university but Freud at Yale,

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.373
for instance,
is much more likely to be found

00:41:38.373 --> 00:41:40.998
in the history department or the
literature department than in

00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:45.607
the psychology department.
And this is typical enough but,

00:41:45.607 --> 00:41:50.529
despite all of the,
sort of, sour things I just

00:41:50.529 --> 00:41:53.840
said about Freud,
the big idea,

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:59.150
the importance of the dynamic
unconscious, remains intact.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:03.401
We will go over and over and
over again different case

00:42:03.401 --> 00:42:07.732
studies where some really
interesting aspects of mental

00:42:07.732 --> 00:42:12.210
life prove to be unconscious.
Now, there's one question.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:17.819
I'm actually going to skip over
this for reasons of time and

00:42:17.819 --> 00:42:22.763
just go to some examples of the
unconscious in modern

00:42:22.763 --> 00:42:27.532
psychology.
So, here's a simple example of

00:42:27.532 --> 00:42:32.545
the unconscious in modern
psychology: Language

00:42:32.545 --> 00:42:36.932
understanding.
So, when you hear a sentence

00:42:36.932 --> 00:42:42.095
like, "John thinks that Bill
likes him," in a fraction of a

00:42:42.095 --> 00:42:47.435
second you realize that this
means that John thinks that Bill

00:42:47.435 --> 00:42:49.844
likes John.
If you heard the

00:42:49.844 --> 00:42:53.413
sentence--Oops--"John thinks
that Bill likes himself," in a

00:42:53.413 --> 00:42:57.228
fraction of a second you would
think that it means "John thinks

00:42:57.228 --> 00:43:00.246
that Bill likes Bill."
And as we will get to when we

00:43:00.246 --> 00:43:02.820
get to the lecture on language,
this is not conscious.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.683
You don't know how you do this.
You don't even know that you

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:09.010
are doing this but you do it
quickly and instinctively.

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:13.280
So much of our day-to-day life
can be done unconsciously.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.020
There are different activities
you can do – driving,

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.772
chewing gum,
shoelace tying – where if

00:43:19.772 --> 00:43:23.342
you're good enough at them,
if you're expert enough at

00:43:23.342 --> 00:43:25.469
them, you don't know you're
doing them.

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:29.010
I was at a party a few years
ago for a friend of mine and we

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:32.190
ran out of food so he said,
"I'll just go pick up some

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:34.154
food."
An hour later he was

00:43:34.154 --> 00:43:37.360
gone--still gone and it was
around the corner.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.645
And we called him up on his
cell phone and he said,

00:43:40.645 --> 00:43:44.073
"Oh.
I got on the highway and I

00:43:44.073 --> 00:43:47.019
drove to work."
Yeah.

00:43:47.019 --> 00:43:49.709
He works an hour away but he
got on the highway "drive drive

00:43:49.709 --> 00:43:52.166
drive."
And these--some version of

00:43:52.166 --> 00:43:55.080
these things happen all of the
time.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:03.689
Maybe more surprising,
Freud's insight that our likes

00:44:03.689 --> 00:44:08.414
and dislikes are due to factors
that we're not necessarily

00:44:08.414 --> 00:44:12.724
conscious of has a lot of
empirical support--a lot of

00:44:12.724 --> 00:44:17.780
empirical support from research
into social psychology,

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.848
for example.
So, here's one finding from

00:44:20.848 --> 00:44:25.241
social psychology.
If somebody goes through a

00:44:25.241 --> 00:44:32.166
terrible initiation to get into
a club, they'll like the club

00:44:32.166 --> 00:44:34.555
more.
You might think they'd like it

00:44:34.555 --> 00:44:36.900
less because people do terrible
things to them.

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.295
But actually,
hazing is illegal but a

00:44:40.295 --> 00:44:45.049
remarkably successful tool.
The more you pay for something

00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:49.021
the more you like it and the
more pain you go through to get

00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:53.958
something the more you like it.
From the standpoint of politics

00:44:53.958 --> 00:44:57.547
for instance,
if you want loyal people in a

00:44:57.547 --> 00:45:00.880
political campaign,
do not pay them.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.389
If you pay them,
they'll like you less.

00:45:03.389 --> 00:45:07.060
If they volunteer,
they'll like you more.

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:10.987
And we'll talk about why.
There's different theories

00:45:10.987 --> 00:45:14.603
about why, but my point right
now is simply that people don't

00:45:14.603 --> 00:45:18.159
necessarily know this but still
they're subject to this.

00:45:18.159 --> 00:45:23.502
Another example is some weird
studies done in a discipline of

00:45:23.502 --> 00:45:28.666
social psychology known as
terror management which involves

00:45:28.666 --> 00:45:33.240
subliminal death primes.
The idea of subliminal death

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.922
primes is this.
You sign up for your human

00:45:35.922 --> 00:45:39.368
subjects requirement and then
you--they put you in front of a

00:45:39.368 --> 00:45:41.780
computer screen and then they
tell you,

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.181
"Oh, just sit in front of the
computer screen and then we'll

00:45:44.181 --> 00:45:46.754
ask you some questions."
And then the questions come out

00:45:46.754 --> 00:45:49.343
and they're questions like,
"How much do you love your

00:45:49.343 --> 00:45:52.900
country?"
"What do you think of Asians?"

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.010
"What do you think of Jews?"
"What do you think of blacks?"

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:56.769
"What do you think of
vegetarians?"

00:45:56.769 --> 00:45:59.526
"What do you think of people's
political views different from

00:45:59.526 --> 00:46:01.639
yours?"
Here's the gimmick.

00:46:01.639 --> 00:46:06.980
What you don't know is on that
computer screen words are being

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:12.145
flashed like that but they're
being flashed so fast it looks

00:46:12.145 --> 00:46:17.310
like that--You don't see
anything--words like "corpse,"

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:21.060
"dead," "dying."
The flashing of these

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:24.153
subliminal words,
"subliminal" meaning – a

00:46:24.153 --> 00:46:28.110
fancy term meaning below the
level of consciousness,

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:31.793
you don't know you're seeing
them – has dramatic effects on

00:46:31.793 --> 00:46:36.880
how you answer those questions.
People exposed to death primes

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:41.061
become more nationalistic,
more patriotic,

00:46:41.061 --> 00:46:46.650
less forgiving of other people,
less liking of other races and

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:49.820
people from other countries.
Again the claim--the

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.239
explanation for why this is so
is something which we'll get to

00:46:53.239 --> 00:46:56.167
in another class.
The point now is simply to

00:46:56.167 --> 00:47:00.407
illustrate that these sort of
things can have--that things you

00:47:00.407 --> 00:47:04.230
aren't aware of can have an
effect on how you think.

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:09.989
The final example I'll give of
this is a short demonstration.

00:47:09.989 --> 00:47:13.199
To do this, I'm going to cut
the class in half at this point

00:47:13.199 --> 00:47:15.429
so you'll be on this side of the
class,

00:47:15.429 --> 00:47:20.958
the right side,
my right, and this will be on

00:47:20.958 --> 00:47:26.487
the left side,
and I simply want everybody to

00:47:26.487 --> 00:47:32.349
think about somebody you love.
So, think about somebody you

00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:34.450
love, your girlfriend,
your boyfriend,

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:37.290
your mom, your dad.
Think about somebody you love.

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:40.900
Just think.
Okay.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.056
Now, on this screen is going to
be instructions but I want to

00:47:45.056 --> 00:47:48.590
give the instructions to this
half of the class .

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:51.449
I'm going to ask everybody in
this half of the class please

00:47:51.449 --> 00:47:53.520
either turn your head or shut
your eyes.

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:56.390
Okay?
Teaching fellows too.

00:47:56.390 --> 00:48:02.385
Okay.
And everybody on this half obey

00:48:02.385 --> 00:48:03.470
.
Okay.

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:09.600
Has everybody read that?
Okay.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:17.438
Now, turn your head, this group.
Now this group:

00:48:17.438 --> 00:48:26.476
Look at this and take a moment.
You don't have to do it on

00:48:26.476 --> 00:48:30.519
paper but take a moment to do it
in your head.

00:48:30.519 --> 00:48:31.820
You--Each group had
instructions.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.320
Some people might have seen
both instructions.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:39.289
Follow the instructions you got
for you.

00:48:39.289 --> 00:48:45.679
Now, this was research done by
Norbert Schwarz and here's the

00:48:45.679 --> 00:48:51.749
question I want you to ask
yourself, "How much do you like

00:48:51.749 --> 00:48:54.872
this person?"
And here's the effect:

00:48:54.872 --> 00:48:58.510
Half of you were asked to list
three features of the person.

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:01.070
Half of you were asked to list
ten.

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:03.938
The finding,
which is not a subtle finding,

00:49:03.938 --> 00:49:08.105
is that liking goes up in the
three group and liking goes down

00:49:08.105 --> 00:49:10.940
in the ten group.
And here is why.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:18.000
I have to think about three
positive features of somebody so

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.400
I think about my girlfriend.
I have a girlfriend.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.796
I think about my girlfriend,
"but oh, she's smart,

00:49:24.796 --> 00:49:27.349
she's beautiful and she's kind.
Good.

00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:30.679
How much do--What do I think of
her?

00:49:30.679 --> 00:49:32.387
"Pretty, good,
smart, beautiful,

00:49:32.387 --> 00:49:33.819
kind, smart,
beautiful, oh,

00:49:33.819 --> 00:49:35.419
yeah."
But the problem--;Now,

00:49:35.419 --> 00:49:38.053
Schwarz is clever though.
He says, "List--" The other

00:49:38.053 --> 00:49:40.118
group gets ten positive
features, "smart,

00:49:40.118 --> 00:49:45.727
beautiful,
kind… really nice… good

00:49:45.727 --> 00:49:51.030
cook… punctual,
smart… No,

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:57.232
I mentioned that."
The problem is nobody has ten

00:49:57.232 --> 00:50:01.225
positive features!
And the effect of being asked

00:50:01.225 --> 00:50:05.780
to do ten positive features is
people find this hard.

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.615
And then those people,
when asked, "How much do you

00:50:08.615 --> 00:50:13.192
like this person?"
say, "Couldn't really make it

00:50:13.192 --> 00:50:16.415
that ten.
I guess I don't like them very

00:50:16.415 --> 00:50:18.736
much."
Now, the point of this

00:50:18.736 --> 00:50:22.179
illustration,
again, is that it shows that

00:50:22.179 --> 00:50:25.817
you don't know this.
Subjects who were asked to do

00:50:25.817 --> 00:50:29.291
ten positive features and then
later ranked the person lower

00:50:29.291 --> 00:50:31.823
and then asked,
"Why did you rank the person

00:50:31.823 --> 00:50:34.595
lower?"
Don't say, "'Cause you told me

00:50:34.595 --> 00:50:37.518
to list ten."
Typically, we are oblivious to

00:50:37.518 --> 00:50:41.501
these factors that change our
points – what we like and what

00:50:41.501 --> 00:50:45.138
we dislike – and this is,
in fact, a substantial and an

00:50:45.138 --> 00:50:48.670
important part of the study of
psychology, and particularly,

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:51.797
for instance,
the study of racial and sexual

00:50:51.797 --> 00:50:54.184
prejudice.
Where--One of the big findings

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:56.657
from social psychology,
and we'll devote almost an

00:50:56.657 --> 00:51:00.428
entire lecture to this,
is that people have strong

00:51:00.428 --> 00:51:05.911
views about other races that
they don't know about and that

00:51:05.911 --> 00:51:10.449
they don't know how to control
their actions.

00:51:10.449 --> 00:51:14.831
So, to some extent,
this rounds out Freud because

00:51:14.831 --> 00:51:20.400
to some extent the particulars
of Freud are--for the most part

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.698
have been rejected.
But the general idea of Freud's

00:51:24.698 --> 00:51:28.812
actually been so successful both
in the study of scientific

00:51:28.812 --> 00:51:32.500
psychology and in our
interpretation of everyday life

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.994
that,
to some extent,

00:51:33.994 --> 00:51:36.190
Freud's been a victim of his
own success.

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:40.450
We tend to underestimate the
importance of Freudian thought

00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:44.710
in everyday life because he's
transformed our world view to

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:48.751
such an extent that it's
difficult for us to remember if

00:51:48.751 --> 00:51:52.130
there's any other way to think
about it.

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:54.804
So, to some extent,
he's been the victim of his own

00:51:54.804 --> 00:51:57.202
success.
We have time for some further

00:51:57.202 --> 00:52:00.862
questions about Freud and about
scientific implications of

00:52:00.862 --> 00:52:01.440
Freud.

00:52:07.449 --> 00:52:10.682
I took a class once on how to
teach when I was a graduate

00:52:10.682 --> 00:52:12.913
student.
And I just remember two things

00:52:12.913 --> 00:52:16.579
from this class.
One thing is never grade in red

00:52:16.579 --> 00:52:18.989
pen.
Those--People don't like that.

00:52:18.989 --> 00:52:21.201
The second thing is never ask
any questions,

00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:23.671
because presumably it is very
frightening to ask,

00:52:23.671 --> 00:52:25.694
"Any questions?"
and people find it's

00:52:25.694 --> 00:52:28.168
intimidating.
I'm supposed to ask,

00:52:28.168 --> 00:52:33.670
"What are your questions?"
So, what are your questions?

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:37.940
Yes, in back.
Sorry.

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.483
Student:
Did Freud believe in

00:52:39.483 --> 00:52:41.203
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:52:41.203 --> 00:52:42.570
Did Freud believe in
[inaudible]

00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:44.466
Student:
Medication Professor Paul

00:52:44.466 --> 00:52:47.875
Bloom: Medication.
Freud had an--It's a good

00:52:47.875 --> 00:52:49.483
question.
The question was,

00:52:49.483 --> 00:52:51.349
"Does--did Freud believe in
medication?"

00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:54.097
Medication, of course,
being a major theme of how we

00:52:54.097 --> 00:52:57.275
deal with certain disorders now,
particularly depression and

00:52:57.275 --> 00:52:59.621
anxiety disorders.
On the one hand,

00:52:59.621 --> 00:53:02.670
Freud made his start as a
neuroscientist.

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:07.531
Freud studied the mind and the
brain and was intensely

00:53:07.531 --> 00:53:12.760
interested in the neural basis
of thought and behavior.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.672
But the answer to your question
in the end is,

00:53:14.672 --> 00:53:16.219
"no."
Although Freud was very

00:53:16.219 --> 00:53:19.369
sensitive to the brain basis of
behavior, Freud was totally

00:53:19.369 --> 00:53:22.411
convinced that the method
through which to cure disorders

00:53:22.411 --> 00:53:25.345
like depression and anxiety
would not be medication but

00:53:25.345 --> 00:53:28.550
rather through the sort of talk
therapy and insight.

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:33.655
Moreover, modern therapists,
including some people who

00:53:33.655 --> 00:53:37.796
aren't psychoanalytically
defined, will say,

00:53:37.796 --> 00:53:40.407
"Look.
These drugs are all well and

00:53:40.407 --> 00:53:43.349
good but what they do is they
mask the symptoms."

00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:47.561
So, if you have panic attacks,
say, it's true that drugs might

00:53:47.561 --> 00:53:51.221
make the panic attacks go away,
but the panic attacks are

00:53:51.221 --> 00:53:54.755
actually not your real problem.
And by making them go away you

00:53:54.755 --> 00:53:57.050
don't get to the root of your
problem.

00:53:57.050 --> 00:54:00.034
So, the answer is both Freud
and modern day psychoanalysts

00:54:00.034 --> 00:54:03.229
would think that medications are
substantially overused in the

00:54:03.229 --> 00:54:06.739
treatment of mental disorders.
Yes.

00:54:06.739 --> 00:54:09.599
Student:
Are there any [inaudible]

00:54:09.599 --> 00:54:12.746
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question is,

00:54:12.746 --> 00:54:15.320
"What about research on
dreams?"

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:19.318
"Dreams" is such a fun topic
that I'm going to devote half a

00:54:19.318 --> 00:54:22.404
class to sleeping and dreams.
So, for instance,

00:54:22.404 --> 00:54:25.880
I will answer the question
"What is the most common dream?"

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.800
I will also answer the question
"Who thinks about sex more in

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.380
dreams, men or women,
and what proportion of--" Oh.

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.199
There's so many great questions
I will answer.

00:54:33.199 --> 00:54:36.590
Dreams from a Freudian
standpoint.

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:40.878
There's been some evidence that
dreams do, and some often do,

00:54:40.878 --> 00:54:44.808
have some relationship to what
you're thinking about and

00:54:44.808 --> 00:54:48.742
worrying about through the day.
But the strong Freudian view

00:54:48.742 --> 00:54:51.198
about symbolism and wish
fulfillment has not been

00:54:51.198 --> 00:54:53.040
supported by the study of
dreams.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:03.516
What are your other questions?
Yes, whoever Erik is pointing

00:55:03.516 --> 00:55:04.679
to.
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:55:04.679 --> 00:55:07.019
Purple shirt.
Yes.

00:55:07.019 --> 00:55:09.800
Student:
[inaudible]--Electra complex?

00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.590
Professor Paul Bloom:
The Electra complex?

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:16.019
The Electra complex is the
penis envy story.

00:55:16.019 --> 00:55:19.390
Freud developed--This is a
crude summary,

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:23.182
but Freud developed the Oedipal
complex, "Mom,

00:55:23.182 --> 00:55:25.119
I love Mommy,
Dad."

00:55:25.119 --> 00:55:28.121
And then it's as if somebody
reminded him,

00:55:28.121 --> 00:55:30.610
"Sigmund, there are also
women."

00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:33.460
"Oh, yeah."
And that story I told you with

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:37.347
the penises and the penis envy
and the replacement is sort of a

00:55:37.347 --> 00:55:40.420
very shortened version of the
Electra complex.

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:45.258
I think it's fair to say that
the Electra complex was a sort

00:55:45.258 --> 00:55:50.180
of add-on to the main interest
of Freud's Oedipal complex.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.139
One more, please.
Yes.

Professor Paul Bloom:
According to Freud,

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:10.101
the--there's not a fixation in
the stage, in the same sense as

00:56:10.101 --> 00:56:12.679
an oral or anal stage,
but yes.

00:56:12.679 --> 00:56:16.320
The claim that Freud would make
is that the woman's discovery

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.777
that she lacks the penis plays a
fundamental role later on

00:56:19.777 --> 00:56:23.478
determining her allegiances in
life and in fact her own sexual

00:56:23.478 --> 00:56:27.328
preferences and interests.
So, it's not the sort of thing

00:56:27.328 --> 00:56:30.000
that affects her just for a
short period.

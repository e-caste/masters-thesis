00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.474
Professor John Rogers:
 Everyone agrees that the

00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:07.390
epic similes in Paradise Lost
are different from the epic

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.636
similes in any other epic poem,
and everyone agrees -- I'm just

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:13.942
going to be presenting to you a
sense of critical consensus here

00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:16.566
-- everyone agrees that the
similes are in some way

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.610
absolutely essential to an
understanding of this remarkable

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.343
poem.
Everyone agrees that what

00:00:22.343 --> 00:00:26.887
Milton is doing in the similes
is educating the reader,

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:31.164
the reader of this poem.
He's introducing the reader to

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:35.238
a mode of vision different from
the vision typically permitted

00:00:35.238 --> 00:00:39.180
him from within the poem's more
or less straightforward,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.916
linear, narrative boundaries.
The similes enable us to see

00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:48.633
something about the story that
the rest of the poem doesn't

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:52.622
enable us to see.
I think that it's fair to say

00:00:52.622 --> 00:00:57.101
that everyone agrees on that,
and that's not nothing but

00:00:57.101 --> 00:01:00.929
that's pretty much where the
agreement ends.

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.526
Milton's similes are
notoriously difficult as you no

00:01:05.526 --> 00:01:10.139
doubt have already experienced.
The poem seems unusually

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:13.760
self-conscious about the role
that its similes play.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.877
So think of the article on
Milton's similes by Geoffrey

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.288
Hartman.
Hartman describes Milton's

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:23.775
tendency in Paradise
Lost, and he takes this term

00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:26.438
from Coleridge:
the tendency to stand ab

00:01:26.438 --> 00:01:29.290
extra,
to stand from outside.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.123
Milton's looking in at his own
work from a distance,

00:01:33.123 --> 00:01:36.280
according to Coleridge and then
Hartman.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.674
Hartman associates this image
of Milton's standing ab

00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:43.501
extra with the figures in so
many of those similes who seem

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:45.970
also to be standing ab
extra.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.049
I think Hartman is absolutely
right to note that it's this

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.343
aspect of Milton's similes that
sets them entirely apart from

00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:58.638
the similes in any other epic
poem.Everyone should have a

00:01:58.638 --> 00:02:01.980
handout.
Does everyone have a handout?

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:09.000
Yes, okay.
So this is my first point.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.170
There's always,
and I think this is nearly

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.043
invariable -- there's an element
in Milton's similes that stands

00:02:17.043 --> 00:02:20.909
outside the framework of the
basic comparison.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.045
In Book One alone there are
four primary instances of what

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:28.599
we can think of as this primary
simile dynamic.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.918
We can call these the observer
similes, and you see that

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:35.524
they're listed on the handout.
First we have the "Pilot of

00:02:35.524 --> 00:02:38.873
some small night-founder'd
Skiff," and the pilot stands

00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:40.671
ab extra,
from outside,

00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:43.910
in the simile.
The simile is there ostensibly

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.620
to compare Satan with the great
sea beast, leviathan.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.435
In the comparison of Satan's
shield with the moon is the

00:02:50.435 --> 00:02:53.045
figure of the Tuscan artist,
the Tuscan artist being

00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:55.447
Galileo.
Galileo appears in the simile

00:02:55.447 --> 00:02:58.590
but actually seems to be
unnecessary for the general

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.636
purposes of the comparison.
Then we have the simile of the

00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:05.492
fallen leaves,
which compares the fallen

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:09.308
angels to fallen leaves,
and in that simile we have the

00:03:09.308 --> 00:03:12.134
image of the Israelites.
Milton calls them the

00:03:12.134 --> 00:03:15.524
"Sojourners of Goshen," and
they're standing outside the

00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:17.990
general parameters of the
comparison.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.533
In each of these cases the
figure who stands ab

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:24.569
extra, from outside,
is an observer,

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.858
an observer looking in and
interpreting the action before

00:03:28.858 --> 00:03:33.145
him and an observer in a
position presumably to make some

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:37.970
kind of moral judgment on the
action taking place.Okay.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.114
First of all,
let's look at the simile that

00:03:41.114 --> 00:03:43.960
compares Satan's shield to the
moon.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.312
This is Book One, line 283.
This should be in the

00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:51.849
Hughes, page 218.
Okay: 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.143
He scarce had ceas't when
the superior Fiend [that's

00:03:56.143 --> 00:03:59.910
obviously Satan]Was moving
toward the shore;

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.590
his ponderous
shield,Ethereal temper,

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.729
massy, large and
round,Behind him cast;

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:12.497
the broad circumferenceHung
on his shoulders like the Moon,

00:04:12.497 --> 00:04:16.265
whose OrbThrough Optic
Glass the Tuscan Artist

00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:19.879
viewsAt Ev'ning from the top
of Fesole,

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:24.758
Or in Valdarno,
to descry new Lands,Rivers

00:04:24.758 --> 00:04:28.840
or Mountains in her spotty
Globe.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.219
Let's try to take this apart.
As I see it,

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.615
the official function of this
simile is to give us a sense of

00:04:35.615 --> 00:04:38.955
the size of Satan's shield and
thereby to give us a sense of

00:04:38.955 --> 00:04:43.043
the size of Satan himself.
Satan's shield is as big as the

00:04:43.043 --> 00:04:46.506
moon -- this is the most common
form of simile,

00:04:46.506 --> 00:04:50.120
epic or otherwise,
and it can be schematized.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.571
Well, I'm going to write on the
board, "shield equals moon," and

00:04:56.571 --> 00:05:02.203
you can schematize it with,
let's say, "A equals A'."

00:05:02.203 --> 00:05:03.330
A'?

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:16.569
You get it, something slightly
different from A.

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:19.792
That kind of makes sense,
but there's more,

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:24.319
of course, here than the moon
to describe Satan's shield.

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.185
It's a much more elaborate
simile than that:

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:31.251
"the broad circumference / hung
on his shoulders like the Moon

00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:35.250
whose Orb / through Optic Glass
the Tuscan Artist views.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.631
All of a sudden a third element
has been injected in to the

00:05:38.631 --> 00:05:40.904
comparison.
It has nothing whatsoever to do

00:05:40.904 --> 00:05:43.639
with the question of simply the
size of Satan's shield,

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.809
and we realize that we have to
redraw the schema into which we

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:52.484
fit this simile.
So it's not merely "A equals

00:05:52.484 --> 00:05:58.196
A'."
It's "A equals A' X," and X

00:05:58.196 --> 00:06:06.009
here would be Galileo,
the Tuscan artist.

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.116
The X of course doesn't
announce its purpose within the

00:06:10.116 --> 00:06:14.872
logical context of the simile.
One of the labors of reading

00:06:14.872 --> 00:06:20.078
Paradise Lost is the
reader's obligation to supply

00:06:20.078 --> 00:06:24.924
the analog for the X,
and this poem is filled with

00:06:24.924 --> 00:06:27.449
such X's.So,
what is it?

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.136
What is it, we ask,
in the action of the poem that

00:06:30.136 --> 00:06:32.220
this X could be analogous
to?

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.104
It's a good question,
and I think it still stands

00:06:35.104 --> 00:06:38.410
unresolved in the general
understanding of this poem.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.660
What does this observer ab
extra represent?

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.270
Milton's similes always seem
overstuffed.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.926
They're overdetermined.
They always mean or signify far

00:06:47.926 --> 00:06:52.012
more than they're supposed to if
their job is simply to make a

00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:54.642
comparison.
There's never been any

00:06:54.642 --> 00:06:59.411
agreement, so far as I can tell,
as to who it is we're supposed

00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:02.949
to be imagining the outside
observer to be,

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:06.470
and there are all sorts of
conjectures.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.950
There is the reader.
There is God.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.539
There's Milton.
There are a number of

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:14.767
possibilities.Now,
this particular simile conjures

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:18.179
for us an image of someone
trying to get a fix on Satan's

00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:21.597
shield,
and there's the suggestion here

00:07:21.597 --> 00:07:26.192
of an attempt to get a proper
perspective on this huge

00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:28.350
character,
Satan.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.726
By extension we have our
attempt as readers to arrive at

00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:34.980
an understanding of the first
two books in general.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:40.066
I think it's easy to see why
Milton would have wanted to do

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:42.991
this.
There's no question that it's

00:07:42.991 --> 00:07:47.694
Satan who in these first two
books completely overwhelms our

00:07:47.694 --> 00:07:50.351
imagination.
He's without question the most

00:07:50.351 --> 00:07:52.544
compelling figure,
certainly, in the first two

00:07:52.544 --> 00:07:55.029
books and, I think,
arguably in the entire poem.

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:59.119
This fact is a continually
troubling phenomenon both for

00:07:59.119 --> 00:08:02.540
Milton and, of course,
for Milton's readers.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.051
It only stands to reason,
I think, that Milton would want

00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:09.375
to inscribe within this poem the
problem posed by this

00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:12.949
extraordinarily compelling
characterization of Satan.

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:15.110
How are we supposed to see
Satan?

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.776
How are we supposed to arrive
at some kind of proper moral

00:08:18.776 --> 00:08:23.290
discernment of Satan's being?
This is the type of question

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.970
that these similes are
continually raising.But we

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.480
have further to go with this
simile.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.581
So initially the ponderous
shield is of an "ethereal

00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:37.458
temper," we are told.
It has been tempered in a

00:08:37.458 --> 00:08:40.473
celestial fire in ether,
and it was the ether of the

00:08:40.473 --> 00:08:44.138
ethereal heavens that had always
been thought -- throughout the

00:08:44.138 --> 00:08:48.865
Renaissance and long before,
of course -- to be the most

00:08:48.865 --> 00:08:52.903
perfect substance imaginable.
The moon, too,

00:08:52.903 --> 00:08:56.919
was widely believed to be a
perfect sphere of fiery ether.

00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:59.960
Like the sun,
it was thought to be a perfect

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.929
heavenly body and,
as you probably know,

00:09:02.929 --> 00:09:05.881
it was Galileo though -- the
Tuscan artist,

00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:10.027
the Italian astronomer -- who
disproved just that assumption

00:09:10.027 --> 00:09:14.243
in 1610 when he published the
Sidereus Nuncius (The

00:09:14.243 --> 00:09:18.460
Starry Messenger). So
with his optic glass,

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.922
his telescope,
Galileo was able to discern

00:09:21.922 --> 00:09:26.785
spots on the orb of the moon.
It turned out to be a spotty

00:09:26.785 --> 00:09:30.801
globe just like the earth.
The moon seemed to contain all

00:09:30.801 --> 00:09:33.209
of the geological imperfections
[laughs]

00:09:33.209 --> 00:09:35.838
of earth.
Suddenly, looking through the

00:09:35.838 --> 00:09:39.225
optic glass, one could see
valleys, it seemed to have

00:09:39.225 --> 00:09:41.570
rivers, and there were
mountains.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.350
It could no longer be said that
the moon was perfect.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.799
It was no longer a fiery
heavenly body.

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:49.304
It was no longer,
after Galileo,

00:09:49.304 --> 00:09:53.506
of an ethereal temper.It's
in this light that the

00:09:53.506 --> 00:09:56.179
introduction,
I think, of Galileo in this

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:58.250
simile starts to make a little
more sense.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.806
If we had been thinking -- and
some of us may well have been

00:10:01.806 --> 00:10:05.182
thinking and we were right to
think provisionally -- that

00:10:05.182 --> 00:10:08.980
Satan was a character that we
could actually identify with,

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.570
if we had been thinking that
Satan was in any way a perfect

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.937
character with some sort of
justifiable claim -- these

00:10:13.937 --> 00:10:16.170
thoughts are now being corrected
by the means,

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.452
by the mechanism, of the simile.
Like the moon,

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:23.660
Satan may look beautiful,
but upon a closer scrutiny that

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.320
beauty begins to yield certain
metaphysical flaws.Okay.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.242
That's one way to read the
simile, one way to make sense of

00:10:33.242 --> 00:10:37.570
this mention of the X,
the Galileo figure.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.961
That's a moral reading of
Paradise Lost that I've

00:10:40.961 --> 00:10:43.122
just given you;
but of course,

00:10:43.122 --> 00:10:48.210
it's only a partial one because
we haven't gone further enough.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:52.355
It's not simply that Galileo
represents the admiring observer

00:10:52.355 --> 00:10:56.500
of Satan who is finally able to
arrive at a just sense of his

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.669
moral spots and imperfections.
It's more complicated than that.

00:11:00.669 --> 00:11:07.269
Galileo himself is viewing the
situation from a fallen and an

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:11.120
unperfect, uncertain
perspective.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.997
Galileo's only using,
of course, his telescope in the

00:11:14.997 --> 00:11:18.801
first place because his human
capacity for vision is

00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:22.529
insufficient to see the truths
of the heavens.

00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:26.926
The unfallen Adam certainly
didn't need a telescope to

00:11:26.926 --> 00:11:30.409
discern a lot about the heavenly
bodies.

00:11:30.409 --> 00:11:33.805
Further complicating the
picture, Milton places this

00:11:33.805 --> 00:11:37.601
scene of observation with
extraordinary care at the moment

00:11:37.601 --> 00:11:40.487
of evening.
You'll be noticing as you read

00:11:40.487 --> 00:11:43.695
and reread the poem just how
many crucial moments in

00:11:43.695 --> 00:11:47.029
Paradise Lost occur at
evening or twilight,

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:52.039
that privileged moment between
day and night in which objects

00:11:52.039 --> 00:11:55.379
in our field of vision may be
visible,

00:11:55.379 --> 00:11:58.519
but they're nonetheless
indistinct and indeterminate.

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:01.995
They're blurred.So,
Galileo here is struggling to

00:12:01.995 --> 00:12:06.071
get the proper visionary fix on
the moon at a point in the day

00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:10.534
when there are no absolutes.
We're in between absolute day

00:12:10.534 --> 00:12:13.419
and absolute night,
light and dark.

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:17.311
Milton pushes this image even
further into indistinctness with

00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:20.756
an instance of his famous
deployment of the conjunction

00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:22.853
or.
It has been argued,

00:12:22.853 --> 00:12:26.716
and I think this is a brilliant
point, that the most important

00:12:26.716 --> 00:12:30.200
word in Paradise Lost is
or, the conjunction.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.328
We'll be talking about why
that's the case,

00:12:32.328 --> 00:12:35.318
but you'll get a little sense
of it here: "the Tuscan Artist

00:12:35.318 --> 00:12:38.518
views…
/ from the top of Fesole,

00:12:38.518 --> 00:12:42.958
/ or in Valdarno…"
Well, on some level we'd kind

00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:47.045
of like to know which it is,
either on the top of a mountain

00:12:47.045 --> 00:12:51.235
or in a valley -- the Valdarno,
the valley of the Arno River in

00:12:51.235 --> 00:12:53.480
Italy.
The place names may seem just

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.382
superfluous here,
something additional that has

00:12:56.382 --> 00:12:59.790
nothing whatsoever to do with
the actual purpose of the

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.686
comparison,
but Milton's uncertainty or the

00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:06.156
narrator's uncertainty as to
whether Galileo has stationed

00:13:06.156 --> 00:13:09.625
his telescope at the top of a
mountain or deep in a valley

00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:12.730
raises an important question
about the status,

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.789
literally the status,
of the observer here.

00:13:14.789 --> 00:13:19.773
It's not just that Satan or the
moon or whatever it is that

00:13:19.773 --> 00:13:24.069
we're looking at seems
indeterminate until we get a

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:27.004
proper look at it.
It's so much more complicated

00:13:27.004 --> 00:13:29.685
than that.
We don't even know where it is

00:13:29.685 --> 00:13:33.950
we're supposed to be looking
from, and the choice between

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:38.368
Fesole and Valdarno that Milton
gives the reader is crucial

00:13:38.368 --> 00:13:41.140
here.
The fact of the proliferation

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.399
of possible perspectives is just
as important,

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:48.543
and I would think it's actually
even more important,

00:13:48.543 --> 00:13:52.929
as any single seemingly proper
perspective.Okay.

00:13:52.929 --> 00:13:55.901
This is only the first mention
of Galileo in the poem and,

00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:58.560
as you will see if you're
careful in looking at your

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.553
footnotes in the Hughes,
appears two other times within

00:14:02.553 --> 00:14:06.860
the later similes in the poem,
always in a simile.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.724
You have on the handout the
other mentions in Paradise

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:12.947
Lost of Galileo.
It would be a wonderful paper

00:14:12.947 --> 00:14:16.779
topic, an examination of all of
the Galileo similes.

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:20.386
I think it stands to reason to
assume that this figure of

00:14:20.386 --> 00:14:24.380
Galileo is of some importance to
Milton and the workings of the

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.366
poem.
Galileo is the only

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:30.141
contemporary personage,
the only seventeenth-century

00:14:30.141 --> 00:14:34.360
figure, even so much as
mentioned in Paradise Lost.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.690
The rest of contemporary
history, including all of the

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.903
stormy events leading up to
Milton's own beloved Puritan

00:14:40.903 --> 00:14:42.988
Revolution,
in which Milton himself,

00:14:42.988 --> 00:14:46.112
of course, had participated --
all of that has been at least at

00:14:46.112 --> 00:14:48.961
the literal level,
at the explicit level,

00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:52.870
expunged from the
poem.Galileo's important.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.747
Milton had written in
Areopagitica that he had

00:14:55.747 --> 00:14:57.850
actually met Galileo on his
journey,

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.820
when Milton was a young man and
Galileo was a very old man,

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.343
through the continent.
When Milton met him,

00:15:03.343 --> 00:15:07.225
Galileo would have been old and
blind, not unimportant to the

00:15:07.225 --> 00:15:10.825
later Milton,
and Galileo was under house

00:15:10.825 --> 00:15:15.436
arrest at his home in Fiesole.
He'd been imprisoned for his

00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:18.530
intellectual daring and
affirming the Copernican view

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.970
that the earth orbited around
the sun.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.606
He had rebelled against the
supreme authority of the Roman

00:15:23.606 --> 00:15:25.409
Catholic Church,
and in this respect,

00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:29.220
he provides the poem with
something like an earthly

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.640
version of the arch-rebel Satan
of course: Satan who rebels

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:38.669
against the supreme authority of
the heavenly father.Well,

00:15:38.669 --> 00:15:42.227
that makes sense,
kind of, that Milton had

00:15:42.227 --> 00:15:47.104
clearly admired the astronomer.
In calling him here the Tuscan

00:15:47.104 --> 00:15:50.395
artist, in some respects we can
see him forging an

00:15:50.395 --> 00:15:54.559
identification between himself
as a literary artist and Galileo

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:58.592
as a scientific artist.
The rebellious artist Milton

00:15:58.592 --> 00:16:02.589
and the rebellious astronomer
Galileo are continually

00:16:02.589 --> 00:16:06.970
threatening to lapse into some
sort of identity with Satan

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.419
himself.
Suddenly, the distinctions that

00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:14.608
the simile works so hard to
establish are beginning to

00:16:14.608 --> 00:16:16.337
erode.
Not just that,

00:16:16.337 --> 00:16:20.841
but the moral certainties that
may have seemed distinct when we

00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:24.691
contrasted the ethereal heaven
with the spotty and the

00:16:24.691 --> 00:16:28.760
imperfect nature of Satan and of
the moon -- those,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.222
too begin to seem fairly hazy.
The simile sets out to

00:16:32.222 --> 00:16:36.457
establish the moral polarities
between good and evil,

00:16:36.457 --> 00:16:40.612
but it then works almost
systematically to undo that

00:16:40.612 --> 00:16:44.270
understanding.
The perspective is an evening

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.545
perspective rather than a
perspective of total

00:16:47.545 --> 00:16:50.984
illumination.
The similes are continually

00:16:50.984 --> 00:16:55.617
working to unleash -- and
they're really quite unruly in

00:16:55.617 --> 00:17:00.250
this respect -- to unleash the
moral and the theological

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:05.136
confusion that so much of the
rest of the poem seems really

00:17:05.136 --> 00:17:10.022
quite eager to pin down and to
fix.That was the Galileo

00:17:10.022 --> 00:17:13.435
simile.
That's how big Satan's shield

00:17:13.435 --> 00:17:16.069
was: well, how big is Satan's
spear?

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.750
Milton compares it to the mast
of a ship.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:25.454
This is line 292 in Book One,
the bottom of page 218 in the

00:17:25.454 --> 00:17:28.230
Hughes.
This is a simile that Stanley

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:32.012
Fish brilliantly describes as
central to a certain temporal

00:17:32.012 --> 00:17:34.490
procedure common in Milton's
verse;

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.832
Fish is interested in the
temporal process of reading in

00:17:37.832 --> 00:17:40.730
general.
It's this extraordinary insight

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.204
that he gives us:
we can only read one word at a

00:17:44.204 --> 00:17:47.529
time, we can only read one line
at a time.

00:17:47.529 --> 00:17:50.994
Fish argues that the simile has
no choice but to unfold over

00:17:50.994 --> 00:17:53.990
time, and so in the example
about Milton's spear,

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:58.831
we read first that -- this is
line 292, this is how Stanley

00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:01.670
Fish's reading goes:
"His Spear,

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:06.260
to equal which the tallest Pine
/ hewn on Norwegian hills,

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.769
to be the Mast / of some great
Ammiral [or flagship]."

00:18:10.769 --> 00:18:14.790
An "Ammiral" is a big
warship.Now we may assume,

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.180
having read only that much of
the simile,

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.512
that Satan's spear is as tall
as the mast of the ship,

00:18:21.512 --> 00:18:24.536
not a small spear.
And so we adjust our minds to

00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:27.764
accommodate -- because
presumably we weren't imagining

00:18:27.764 --> 00:18:30.870
Satan to be that big -- to
accommodate this sense of

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.490
Satan's tremendous physical
magnitude.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:37.877
Surely, Satan is bigger than
anything we had been assuming,

00:18:37.877 --> 00:18:41.152
but the simile continues.
As soon as we read the next

00:18:41.152 --> 00:18:43.798
lines, we're struck with the
possibility -- and surely it's

00:18:43.798 --> 00:18:47.463
just a provisional possibility,
but we're struck by the image

00:18:47.463 --> 00:18:50.670
that Satan's spear is actually
quite small.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:57.828
His spear "were but a wand / he
walkt with to support uneasy

00:18:57.828 --> 00:19:00.014
steps."
If only for a moment,

00:19:00.014 --> 00:19:01.890
Satan suddenly seems old and
frail.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.109
This is an image of an old man
with a cane.

00:19:05.109 --> 00:19:08.631
We have to adjust our
understanding of his physical

00:19:08.631 --> 00:19:12.012
size one more time,
and of course necessarily his

00:19:12.012 --> 00:19:15.322
moral magnitude would be
adjusted as well in our

00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:18.210
interpretation.Needless to
say,

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.588
we're not done.
The simile isn't telling us

00:19:21.588 --> 00:19:26.230
that Satan's spear is as small
as a wand because what we have

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:30.929
is a syllogism here.
Satan's spear is to the tallest

00:19:30.929 --> 00:19:36.109
pine what the tallest pine is to
a little, bitty wand.

00:19:36.109 --> 00:19:39.299
Finally we realize that Satan's
spear [laughs]

00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:41.779
is of an unimaginable
proportion.

00:19:41.779 --> 00:19:45.200
Just as soon as we crowded our
imagination already with the

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.150
image of the spear the size of a
Norwegian pine,

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.110
which took a certain
imaginative leap on our parts,

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.544
we realize that Satan and his
spear are immeasurably larger

00:19:54.544 --> 00:19:58.330
even than that.
The simile pushes the size of

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:03.009
the spear clean out of our
rational comprehension,

00:20:03.009 --> 00:20:07.107
and it's this process that is,
according to Stanley Fish,

00:20:07.107 --> 00:20:09.942
the point of the simile.
The circuitous,

00:20:09.942 --> 00:20:13.611
logical route that we had to
take in order to arrive at this

00:20:13.611 --> 00:20:17.405
new sense of Satan's size has
everything to do with our status

00:20:17.405 --> 00:20:20.910
as temporally bound,
temporally constrained

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:26.405
readers.The genius of Fish's
reading of Milton's similes is

00:20:26.405 --> 00:20:31.634
to understand the particularly
time-bound nature of Milton's

00:20:31.634 --> 00:20:34.471
verse.
So first we read that Satan's

00:20:34.471 --> 00:20:36.043
spear is big.
Then we read,

00:20:36.043 --> 00:20:38.999
or at least we think we read,
that Satan's spear is small,

00:20:38.999 --> 00:20:42.006
and then we realize over the
course of this reading process

00:20:42.006 --> 00:20:44.079
that Satan's spear is
unimaginable,

00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:46.711
and we realize that our
time-bound mode of knowing is

00:20:46.711 --> 00:20:49.392
ultimately inadequate to
understand anything about the

00:20:49.392 --> 00:20:52.529
inscrutable truths of eternity:
this is according to Fish.

00:20:52.529 --> 00:20:55.653
We can't know anything certain
about the eternal and the

00:20:55.653 --> 00:20:58.947
immortal world of Paradise
Lost except through these

00:20:58.947 --> 00:21:01.559
faculties we have and those are
uncertain,

00:21:01.559 --> 00:21:06.809
imperfect, fallen human
capacities of reading.

00:21:06.809 --> 00:21:10.264
Milton wants the reader to know
that she's fallen,

00:21:10.264 --> 00:21:13.718
we are all fallen,
and any problem that we have in

00:21:13.718 --> 00:21:17.878
understanding the theology of
heaven and hell is our problem

00:21:17.878 --> 00:21:21.424
as fallen readers.
Fish imagines Milton as always

00:21:21.424 --> 00:21:23.959
on some level slapping the
reader's wrist,

00:21:23.959 --> 00:21:27.049
reminding the reader of his or
her fallen-ness,

00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:30.769
that there's a constant
pedagogical correction going

00:21:30.769 --> 00:21:34.950
on.That was Stanley Fish.
The other great critic of the

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:38.660
Miltonic simile for my money
takes a completely different

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.180
tack,
and that's Geoffrey Hartman who

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.840
makes an argument that might
even be thought to contradict

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.304
Fish's argument,
although actually Geoffrey

00:21:48.304 --> 00:21:52.982
Hartman wrote his piece first.
Hartman's image of the simile

00:21:52.982 --> 00:21:55.400
isn't temporal the way Fish's
was.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.938
It's spatial.
For Hartman,

00:21:57.938 --> 00:22:01.573
the Miltonic simile actually
permits the reader something

00:22:01.573 --> 00:22:03.910
like the perspective of
eternity,

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.710
a divine perspective,
and of course,

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.950
this is exactly what Stanley
Fish had told us was impossible.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.669
The rhetorical strategy that
Milton uses to give us this

00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:16.930
perspective of eternity is what
Geoffrey Hartman called Milton's

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.903
counter-plot.
Like Fish, Hartman is most

00:22:19.903 --> 00:22:23.410
interested in the similes of the
first two books,

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.914
the similes that provide some
kind of window onto the world of

00:22:26.914 --> 00:22:30.362
Satan, and he focuses on the
simile actually that follows the

00:22:30.362 --> 00:22:33.579
simile of Satan's shield that
we've been looking at;

00:22:33.579 --> 00:22:38.849
it follows the simile of the
spear that Fish had analyzed.

00:22:38.849 --> 00:22:41.269
This is the simile of the
leaves.

00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:46.216
I'm going to ask you to look at
line 300 of Book One,

00:22:46.216 --> 00:22:50.919
page 219 in the Hughes.
Satan has roused himself

00:22:50.919 --> 00:22:54.998
from off the burning marl,
and he stands in order to call

00:22:54.998 --> 00:22:58.736
up his fallen minions,
to rouse them to acts- great

00:22:58.736 --> 00:23:00.950
acts of heroism.
…

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.479
he stood and call'dHis
Legions, Angel Forms,

00:23:04.479 --> 00:23:08.907

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:49.986
For me the [laughs]
absolutely shocking fact of

00:23:49.986 --> 00:23:53.774
this simile is that its primary
purpose is merely [laughs]

00:23:53.774 --> 00:23:57.495
to describe the number of
angels who are prostrate on the

00:23:57.495 --> 00:24:00.803
burning lake of hell.
They lie entranced,

00:24:00.803 --> 00:24:03.990
thick as -- how many angels
were there?

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:08.717
They lie "thick as Autumnal
leaves that strew the Brooks /

00:24:08.717 --> 00:24:12.222
in Vallombrosa";
but Milton will pursue this

00:24:12.222 --> 00:24:16.769
simile with such a relentless
drive -- it's exhausting -- that

00:24:16.769 --> 00:24:19.914
by the end of it,
I think we've probably

00:24:19.914 --> 00:24:24.127
forgotten its role in merely
illustrating the quantity of

00:24:24.127 --> 00:24:28.791
angel forms.Now the angels
lay as thick as the sedge on the

00:24:28.791 --> 00:24:32.401
Red Sea coast when
Pharaoh--Milton uses the Latin

00:24:32.401 --> 00:24:36.163
Busiris for
"Pharaoh"--with all his Egyptian

00:24:36.163 --> 00:24:40.450
army chased the Israelites
across the Red Sea after God --

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:44.964
and this is the story told in
Exodus 14 -- parted the Red Sea

00:24:44.964 --> 00:24:48.650
to allow the "Sojourners of
Goshen,"

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:53.577
the Israelites, to cross.
Satan's described initially

00:24:53.577 --> 00:24:58.063
here as the wind god Orion,
a classical figure who vexed or

00:24:58.063 --> 00:25:03.152
tossed the waves of the Red Sea,
just as Satan is rousing and

00:25:03.152 --> 00:25:06.299
inspiring his fallen host of
angels;

00:25:06.299 --> 00:25:08.890
but Milton continues to
complicate the simile.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.660
He quickly complicates our
identification of Orion with

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.779
Satan, which wasn't arrived at
that easily to begin with.

00:25:16.779 --> 00:25:20.667
Satan may be like the wind,
Orion, but Orion here is also

00:25:20.667 --> 00:25:24.693
seen as vexing and destroying
the Egyptians whose carcasses

00:25:24.693 --> 00:25:27.539
wash up on the shores of the Red
Sea,

00:25:27.539 --> 00:25:30.361
and the Israelites,
having crossed the Red Sea

00:25:30.361 --> 00:25:33.685
safely, look on at this
destruction from the safety of

00:25:33.685 --> 00:25:38.803
their shore.Think about it.
Something's gone awry in this

00:25:38.803 --> 00:25:41.118
simile.
The wind, Orion,

00:25:41.118 --> 00:25:46.587
had initially represented the
heroic general of his troops,

00:25:46.587 --> 00:25:52.528
Satan -- Geoffrey Hartman would
describe this as the plot of the

00:25:52.528 --> 00:25:54.647
simile;
but this wind,

00:25:54.647 --> 00:25:58.383
Orion, begins immediately to
destroy the evil Busiris,

00:25:58.383 --> 00:26:01.979
the Egyptian Pharaoh:
a figure that biblical history

00:26:01.979 --> 00:26:05.998
had long associated with Satan
and had considered to be an

00:26:05.998 --> 00:26:08.960
earthly version or a type of
Satan.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.608
So you have a wind god who is
identified with Satan destroying

00:26:12.608 --> 00:26:15.299
Pharaoh, who is also identified
with Satan,

00:26:15.299 --> 00:26:18.819
just as he attempts to destroy
God's faithful.

00:26:18.819 --> 00:26:22.772
And it's this final movement of
the simile, according to this

00:26:22.772 --> 00:26:26.790
ingenious argument by Geoffrey
Hartman, that Hartman calls the

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:30.095
counter-plot.
Embedded within the explicit

00:26:30.095 --> 00:26:34.779
plot of the simile is a secret,
a kind of buried narrative,

00:26:34.779 --> 00:26:39.052
and it's a hidden story that
illustrates Satan's

00:26:39.052 --> 00:26:42.799
self-destruction.
It illustrates Satan's

00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:47.939
self-destruction even as the
main narrative of the simile

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:52.983
portrays Satan's heroism.
The plot around the simile is

00:26:52.983 --> 00:26:57.760
glorifying the heroic Satan
here, and Hartman ingeniously

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.537
locates throughout a number of
Milton's similes this same

00:27:02.537 --> 00:27:06.119
dynamic of a redemptive
counter-plot.

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:08.051
It's as if there is a
subterranean,

00:27:08.051 --> 00:27:11.404
figurative movement at work in
the simile that's continually

00:27:11.404 --> 00:27:14.145
reminding us,
according to Hartman,

00:27:14.145 --> 00:27:19.049
of the calm efforts of divine
providence on behalf of us,

00:27:19.049 --> 00:27:23.103
of good Christian men and women
-- some ultimate divine control

00:27:23.103 --> 00:27:26.438
over the evil actions of
Satan.Now the genius of

00:27:26.438 --> 00:27:29.969
Hartman's argument about the
counter-plot was that when

00:27:29.969 --> 00:27:34.088
Hartman floated this argument in
the late ‘50s was that it

00:27:34.088 --> 00:27:36.900
enabled us to understand -- not
us,

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.664
we weren't born then,
but it enabled readers of

00:27:39.664 --> 00:27:43.089
Milton to understand for the
first time something like the

00:27:43.089 --> 00:27:46.635
theological purpose behind a lot
of the most fascinating and

00:27:46.635 --> 00:27:49.700
extraordinary rhetorical effects
of the poem.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.425
And Hartman made sense of the
seemingly chaotic and confused

00:27:53.425 --> 00:27:56.329
movement of the narrator's
imagination here.

00:27:56.329 --> 00:28:00.182
This counter-plot continues to
reinforce, according to Hartman,

00:28:00.182 --> 00:28:03.724
our faith in the two most
important elements of the poem's

00:28:03.724 --> 00:28:07.391
theology: and that's man's free
will or Milton's doctrine of

00:28:07.391 --> 00:28:11.918
free will on the one hand,
and Milton's insistence on the

00:28:11.918 --> 00:28:16.741
importance of divine providence
on the other hand -- God's

00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:20.058
foreknowledge.
Through the dynamics of the

00:28:20.058 --> 00:28:23.120
counter-plot,
the similes reassure us of what

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.947
Hartman calls the "graceful
coexistence of free will and

00:28:26.947 --> 00:28:29.869
divine providence."Let's
move on.

00:28:29.869 --> 00:28:33.172
Neither of these critics --
neither Fish nor Hartman

00:28:33.172 --> 00:28:36.798
discusses one of the most
celebrated aspects of this last

00:28:36.798 --> 00:28:40.288
simile that we've looked at,
and I have a little hunch that

00:28:40.288 --> 00:28:41.990
there's a reason for their
neglect.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:47.346
This is the initial part of the
simile that describes the

00:28:47.346 --> 00:28:52.702
leaves: "thick as Autumnal
Leaves that strow the Brooks /

00:28:52.702 --> 00:28:57.016
in Vallombrosa,
where th' Etrurian shades /

00:28:57.016 --> 00:29:01.619
high overarch't imbow'r."
At least since the eighteenth

00:29:01.619 --> 00:29:06.019
century, these lines have been
singled out for their beauty

00:29:06.019 --> 00:29:08.294
and,
considering that Milton is

00:29:08.294 --> 00:29:11.849
describing the hideous demons
under Satan's control,

00:29:11.849 --> 00:29:15.542
the pastoral elegance of this
little simile really catches us

00:29:15.542 --> 00:29:19.296
off guard.There's naturally
a lot of pressure on Milton to

00:29:19.296 --> 00:29:22.865
make this part of the simile
beautiful and striking because

00:29:22.865 --> 00:29:25.450
he's echoing not just one epic
poet,

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.380
but essentially he's echoing
just about every epic poet.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.110
Homer and Virgil and,
well after them,

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:35.391
Dante and innumerable others
have all applied the simile of

00:29:35.391 --> 00:29:40.041
the leaves or some version of it
to describe the numberless-ness

00:29:40.041 --> 00:29:42.970
of the dead.
This is on your handout.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.025
In The Iliad,
as you can see,

00:29:45.025 --> 00:29:48.490
the warrior Glaucus uses the
simile of the leaves to dismiss

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.045
the importance of genealogy.
"Why does it matter what family

00:29:52.045 --> 00:29:53.849
I'm from?"
he asks Diomedes.

00:29:53.849 --> 00:29:57.575
"Very like leaves upon this
earth are the generations of

00:29:57.575 --> 00:30:00.254
men."
There's a kind of organic

00:30:00.254 --> 00:30:05.809
continuity that men partake of
just as the natural world does.

00:30:05.809 --> 00:30:09.054
Virgil alludes to just this
passage in Homer when he

00:30:09.054 --> 00:30:12.743
describes the entrance of a
whole crowd of people in to the

00:30:12.743 --> 00:30:16.369
underworld as "the falling of
leaves in the early frost of

00:30:16.369 --> 00:30:19.431
autumn."
This is where Milton gets the

00:30:19.431 --> 00:30:22.436
"autumnal."
Finally, Dante alludes to this

00:30:22.436 --> 00:30:25.948
image of the Virgilian
underworld in The Inferno

00:30:25.948 --> 00:30:29.390
when he describes the
descent of humanity,

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.539
the evil seed of Adam,
into the Christian hell.

00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:35.973
It's Dante who first supplies
the notion of fallen-ness,

00:30:35.973 --> 00:30:38.470
the theological notion of
fallen-ness,

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.163
to this idea of the fact that
the leaves have fallen because

00:30:42.163 --> 00:30:45.127
of course Dante,
unlike Homer and Virgil,

00:30:45.127 --> 00:30:49.491
is a Christian and has access
to the Christian myth of the

00:30:49.491 --> 00:30:54.391
Fall.And so it would seem to
be Dante's use of the image that

00:30:54.391 --> 00:30:57.759
has a primary influence here on
Milton,

00:30:57.759 --> 00:31:01.485
but, as we might expect,
there is a complication in the

00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:04.589
way that Milton uses this
particular image.

00:31:04.589 --> 00:31:08.236
Vallombrosa is a place in Italy
that Milton had actually visited

00:31:08.236 --> 00:31:11.717
as a young man.
He visited Vallombrosa when he

00:31:11.717 --> 00:31:14.880
was introduced to Galileo in
Fiesole.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:20.267
Vallombrosa literally means
"shady valley," and I think it

00:31:20.267 --> 00:31:25.750
recalls Galileo's shady place,
Valdarno, another valley.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:29.277
As you know,
in classical literature the

00:31:29.277 --> 00:31:34.522
dead are referred to as shades,
but here in Milton's simile

00:31:34.522 --> 00:31:38.140
"shades" merely means "shade
trees."

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.263
It refers solely to trees,
and Vallombrosa is the place

00:31:42.263 --> 00:31:46.539
"where th' Etrurian shades /
high overarch't imbow'r."

00:31:46.539 --> 00:31:50.230
If these trees are still
supplying shade,

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:55.951
embowering the entire valley of
Vallombrosa, the leaves haven't

00:31:55.951 --> 00:32:01.288
all fallen, of course.
They're only in the process of

00:32:01.288 --> 00:32:04.442
falling.
I think this is an important

00:32:04.442 --> 00:32:09.229
distinction because what you
have here in the middle of this

00:32:09.229 --> 00:32:14.180
simile in Milton's account of
hell is an image of a bower.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:19.449
This is a little paradise,
a paradise on the verge of

00:32:19.449 --> 00:32:24.009
being lost as the shades lose
their leaves.

00:32:24.009 --> 00:32:27.099
The leaves are about to fall
but they haven't yet fallen.

00:32:27.099 --> 00:32:31.933
I think it's the imminence of
their fallen-ness that lends

00:32:31.933 --> 00:32:36.766
this image its incredibly
powerful emotional intensity and

00:32:36.766 --> 00:32:39.221
also,
I think, its beauty.Now,

00:32:39.221 --> 00:32:42.908
the simile concludes with the
strong sense of a hideous change

00:32:42.908 --> 00:32:46.292
-- and you will recognize this
pattern again and again in

00:32:46.292 --> 00:32:50.220
Milton -- the hideous change
undergone by the fallen angels.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:55.098
But what we have here is an
image of the beauty of that

00:32:55.098 --> 00:33:00.609
change, the beauty of the fact
that the leaves are falling.

00:33:00.609 --> 00:33:04.608
Both Hartman and Fish argued
that the rhetorical strategies

00:33:04.608 --> 00:33:08.193
of Milton's similes work to
reinforce the theological

00:33:08.193 --> 00:33:13.255
categories of good and evil.
They argue that the similes are

00:33:13.255 --> 00:33:18.322
supposed to reassure us that
there is a divine good that

00:33:18.322 --> 00:33:23.390
ultimately overwhelms the evil
represented by Satan;

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:27.824
but neither of these critics
was able to discuss directly

00:33:27.824 --> 00:33:31.942
Milton's aestheticization of the
Fall in the lines on

00:33:31.942 --> 00:33:35.009
Vallombrosa.
That's because it's here where

00:33:35.009 --> 00:33:38.309
the rigid polarities between
light and dark and good and

00:33:38.309 --> 00:33:42.029
evil, all of these absolute
oppositions, begin to collapse.

00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:46.768
Milton opens up a shady space
for something approaching a kind

00:33:46.768 --> 00:33:51.663
of moral relativism where black
and white theological categories

00:33:51.663 --> 00:33:55.173
simply don't apply.
Of course, this is only

00:33:55.173 --> 00:33:59.069
provisional but the shady space
exists nonetheless.

00:33:59.069 --> 00:34:03.496
He returns us to the lowly
perspective that Galileo had

00:34:03.496 --> 00:34:07.759
when he set up his telescope in
that other valley,

00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:11.964
Valdarno, and it's this lowly
vantage point that's beautiful

00:34:11.964 --> 00:34:15.099
in part because it's a fallen
perspective,

00:34:15.099 --> 00:34:19.456
not in spite of the fact that
it's a fallen perspective.I

00:34:19.456 --> 00:34:23.886
think now we can see why these
lines about the autumnal leaves

00:34:23.886 --> 00:34:28.097
are so difficult for us to
incorporate into a moral reading

00:34:28.097 --> 00:34:31.219
or a theological reading of the
poem.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:34.615
They're invariably cited as
among the most beautiful and

00:34:34.615 --> 00:34:38.073
exquisite lines in Paradise
Lost but on some level

00:34:38.073 --> 00:34:41.530
they've proven the bane of
scholars because they can't be

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:45.050
squared with any of the poem's
theological message.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:48.588
This is the remarkable thing
about so many of Milton's

00:34:48.588 --> 00:34:52.527
similes: they're always bursting
out of whatever critical or

00:34:52.527 --> 00:34:57.000
theological constraints that we
work so hard to impose on them.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.301
So for Stanley Fish,
Milton is always reminding us

00:35:00.301 --> 00:35:04.075
of our fallen-ness as readers
and we're continually being

00:35:04.075 --> 00:35:08.051
encouraged to submit all of our
uncertainties and all of our

00:35:08.051 --> 00:35:12.107
doubts to the power of faith.
God is in control of the

00:35:12.107 --> 00:35:15.926
universe and if the poem seems
-- not that Stanley Fish

00:35:15.926 --> 00:35:18.609
believes in God,
but nonetheless his Milton

00:35:18.609 --> 00:35:21.340
certainly does -- God is in
control of the universe.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.957
If the poem seems momentarily
to suggest otherwise,

00:35:24.957 --> 00:35:29.153
that's simply Milton's way of
reminding us of the extent of

00:35:29.153 --> 00:35:32.743
our fallen-ness.
Geoffrey Hartman's theory had a

00:35:32.743 --> 00:35:36.891
similar tendency to align the
poem with a kind of a religious

00:35:36.891 --> 00:35:39.433
orthodoxy.
The similes are for him

00:35:39.433 --> 00:35:43.933
instrument in the poem's larger
agenda to reinforce our faith in

00:35:43.933 --> 00:35:48.719
the coexistence of free will and
divine providence -- difficult,

00:35:48.719 --> 00:35:53.660
huge concepts.Hartman's
absolutely right to insist that

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:58.516
no theological concept is as
important to Paradise Lost

00:35:58.516 --> 00:36:03.627
as free will on the one hand
and divine providence on the

00:36:03.627 --> 00:36:06.016
other.
We can say that,

00:36:06.016 --> 00:36:10.629
but I wonder if it's possible
even for these similes to

00:36:10.629 --> 00:36:14.644
convince us of the easy
coexistence of these two

00:36:14.644 --> 00:36:18.829
incredibly important theological
categories,

00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:21.110
free will and divine
foreknowledge.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.081
Long before Milton had begun to
[laughs]

00:36:23.081 --> 00:36:25.659
tackle the problem,
Christians had for centuries,

00:36:25.659 --> 00:36:29.070
for millennia,
puzzled over the logical

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:32.929
inconsistency between these two
concepts.

00:36:32.929 --> 00:36:35.809
We all have our version of
trying to wrestle with this:

00:36:35.809 --> 00:36:38.369
if God knows what you're going
to do tomorrow,

00:36:38.369 --> 00:36:42.248
to what extent does it make
sense to say that what you do

00:36:42.248 --> 00:36:46.087
tomorrow you do freely?
Milton, like a lot of orthodox

00:36:46.087 --> 00:36:50.302
Christians, will insist when
he's speaking theologically that

00:36:50.302 --> 00:36:54.306
God's foreknowledge has no
causal effect whatsoever on the

00:36:54.306 --> 00:36:56.474
future,
and so it doesn't actually

00:36:56.474 --> 00:36:59.628
impinge on our free will.
God the Father will make a

00:36:59.628 --> 00:37:04.076
similar argument in Book Three.
The conclusion reached in Book

00:37:04.076 --> 00:37:07.516
Three is that God has
foreknowledge but he isn't

00:37:07.516 --> 00:37:11.323
interested in actual
predetermination or some type of

00:37:11.323 --> 00:37:15.495
divine action that literally
compels the behavior of human

00:37:15.495 --> 00:37:18.043
creatures.
So it's possible,

00:37:18.043 --> 00:37:22.719
presumably, to say that Adam
and Eve actually had no choice,

00:37:22.719 --> 00:37:29.321
they had no choice when they
decided to eat the fruit,

00:37:29.321 --> 00:37:35.300
and even though God knew that
of course -- no,

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.570
[laughs]
I said exactly the wrong thing.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:40.139
This is the confusion --
"wandering mazes lost"!

00:37:40.139 --> 00:37:42.815
-- that the problem of free
will and foreknowledge puts us

00:37:42.815 --> 00:37:44.635
in.
Even though God knew exactly

00:37:44.635 --> 00:37:48.090
what Adam and Eve would do --
that they would eat the fruit --

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:51.544
we still have to be able to say
that they ate the fruit freely

00:37:51.544 --> 00:37:53.809
out of their own free
will.Now,

00:37:53.809 --> 00:37:58.783
scholars are ingenious in their
ability to skirt absolutely the

00:37:58.783 --> 00:38:03.756
central conundrum of Providence
that this poem raises and which

00:38:03.756 --> 00:38:08.650
it raises so insistently and
really refuses to let go of;

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:13.190
but that doesn't mean that the
problem just goes away.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:16.191
I can't help but feel that
within the context of the

00:38:16.191 --> 00:38:18.309
[laughs]
actual story of the Fall,

00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:21.534
the Fall of Adam and Eve,
that the idea of divine

00:38:21.534 --> 00:38:24.760
providence isn't actually all
that comforting.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.724
The very idea of divine
providence, when it's injected

00:38:27.724 --> 00:38:31.193
into the story of Adam and Eve's
perfectly disastrous choice to

00:38:31.193 --> 00:38:34.277
eat the apple,
seems to arouse in a lot of us

00:38:34.277 --> 00:38:37.080
feelings of injustice.
What would we call this now?

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:40.453
This is entrapment.
Why did God place the stupid

00:38:40.453 --> 00:38:43.752
fruit in the garden in the first
place if he knew in advance that

00:38:43.752 --> 00:38:46.019
Adam and Eve were going to eat
the thing?

00:38:46.019 --> 00:38:49.855
The very idea of Providence in
this context can,

00:38:49.855 --> 00:38:54.181
in fact, assume a kind of
menacing force that seems to

00:38:54.181 --> 00:38:59.160
compel men and women to their
evil actions regardless of their

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.567
technical possession of this
capacity that we feel very

00:39:03.567 --> 00:39:07.239
comfortable calling free
will.So,

00:39:07.239 --> 00:39:10.419
Hartman and Fish have forwarded
two perfectly ingenious theories

00:39:10.419 --> 00:39:13.275
of Milton's similes,
and they've had a tremendous

00:39:13.275 --> 00:39:16.079
impact, rightly,
on generations now of readers

00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:18.135
of Milton.
They've taught us how to

00:39:18.135 --> 00:39:20.834
appreciate what's strangest and
most remarkable about

00:39:20.834 --> 00:39:24.151
Paradise Lost,
 but I simply cannot

00:39:24.151 --> 00:39:28.755
agree with their suggestion that
Milton's similes work in any

00:39:28.755 --> 00:39:33.589
meaningful way to strengthen our
belief in the Christian idea of

00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:38.039
the coexistence of free will and
God's foreknowledge.

00:39:38.039 --> 00:39:42.233
I am not convinced that the
poem's radical and most

00:39:42.233 --> 00:39:46.510
subversive and most exquisite
rhetorical effects,

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:50.407
these amazing similes,
present us with anything like a

00:39:50.407 --> 00:39:53.570
simple and unambiguous religious
message.

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:57.358
Paradise Lost as a whole
clearly wants us to believe that

00:39:57.358 --> 00:40:00.966
God has foreknowledge and it
also clearly wants us to believe

00:40:00.966 --> 00:40:04.885
that we have free will,
but the similes seem just as

00:40:04.885 --> 00:40:09.150
often to open up and to question
the poem's doctrinal

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:12.278
conclusions.
The similes work not to sew

00:40:12.278 --> 00:40:16.076
everything up but make it
impossible for us to maintain

00:40:16.076 --> 00:40:20.085
anything like the official
position on a moral distinction

00:40:20.085 --> 00:40:23.179
between heavenly good and
satanic evil.

00:40:23.179 --> 00:40:27.381
Milton's interest in moments of
blurriness and of visual

00:40:27.381 --> 00:40:31.889
indistinctness suggest that the
distinction between good and

00:40:31.889 --> 00:40:35.480
evil is actually never that
clear.Okay.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.375
We have time for another
simile, the last simile of Book

00:40:39.375 --> 00:40:42.532
One.
This is page 231 in the

00:40:42.532 --> 00:40:46.239
Hughes.
This is the simile of the

00:40:46.239 --> 00:40:49.550
belated peasant that Hartman
describes.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:52.393
Satan and the fallen angels are
entering the magnificent

00:40:52.393 --> 00:40:55.812
structure of Pandemonium,
and at one instant all of the

00:40:55.812 --> 00:40:59.300
angels shrink in order to fit in
to the building,

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.772
however big it is.
It's obviously too small for

00:41:02.772 --> 00:41:06.770
the angels to fit there in their
proper dimensions.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:10.449
Look at line 779 of Book One: 
[They]

00:41:10.449 --> 00:41:13.936
in narrow roomThrong
numberless, like that Pigmean

00:41:13.936 --> 00:41:17.956
RaceBeyond the Indian Mount,
or Faery Elves,Whose

00:41:17.956 --> 00:41:21.316
midnight Revels,
by a Forest sideOr Fountain

00:41:21.316 --> 00:41:25.154
[Well, which is it?
This is another important

00:41:25.154 --> 00:41:27.872
or]
some belated Peasant

00:41:27.872 --> 00:41:31.776
sees,Or dreams he sees,
while over-head the

00:41:31.776 --> 00:41:34.274
MoonSits Arbitress,
and nearer to the

00:41:34.274 --> 00:41:38.093
EarthWheels her pale course;
they on thir mirth and

00:41:38.093 --> 00:41:41.286
danceIntent,
with jocond Music charm his

00:41:41.286 --> 00:41:45.889
ear;At once with joy and
fear his heart rebounds.

00:41:45.889 --> 00:41:49.368
Now, the purpose of this simile
is to evince the indistinctness

00:41:49.368 --> 00:41:52.960
and the confusion produced by
our vision of the fallen angels.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.367
We can only imagine the fallen
angels with a kind of dim

00:41:56.367 --> 00:41:59.280
uncertainty just as the belated
peasant sees,

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:06.144
or perhaps he only dreams he
sees, the dance of fairy elves

00:42:06.144 --> 00:42:11.803
by a forest side.Now,
so many scholars of Milton are

00:42:11.803 --> 00:42:16.896
under some sort of pressure to
reconcile everything in Milton's

00:42:16.896 --> 00:42:20.510
universe to a single theological
message,

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:24.779
but I think there's something
in this simile that resists our

00:42:24.779 --> 00:42:28.835
alignment of all the things that
the peasant sees with the

00:42:28.835 --> 00:42:31.540
satanic world of unmitigated
evil,

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:35.212
of the fallen angels.
There's a difference between

00:42:35.212 --> 00:42:38.967
fairy elves and hideous demons,
I submit, and with the phrase

00:42:38.967 --> 00:42:42.301
"sees or dreams he sees,"
Milton's alluding to Virgil's

00:42:42.301 --> 00:42:45.465
Aeneas who descends to the
underworld and catches a glimpse

00:42:45.465 --> 00:42:50.117
of the shade of his dead lover,
Dido -- or he thinks he catches

00:42:50.117 --> 00:42:54.449
a glimpse of the shade of his
dead lover, Dido.

00:42:54.449 --> 00:42:58.068
The Virgilian echo gives this
passage in Milton an

00:42:58.068 --> 00:43:01.539
unmistakable pathos and an
undeniable beauty.

00:43:01.539 --> 00:43:05.029
As with the passage on the
falling of the leaves there's a

00:43:05.029 --> 00:43:07.599
kind of elegiac tone that works
to undo,

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:12.219
or at least to challenge,
our theological certainty.

00:43:12.219 --> 00:43:15.947
As we've noticed,
all of these similes have these

00:43:15.947 --> 00:43:19.210
observer figures and this one
does, too.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:23.146
There's a second figure here
standing ab extra,

00:43:23.146 --> 00:43:27.454
and that's the moon hovering
overhead: "while over-head the

00:43:27.454 --> 00:43:31.793
Moon / sits Arbitress."
We're naturally invited to

00:43:31.793 --> 00:43:36.550
question what force is it that
this moon represents.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:39.519
Now you may remember what
Geoffrey Hartman had argued that

00:43:39.519 --> 00:43:42.280
the moon represents the power of
divine providence,

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.159
and there's a lot of ways in
which this reading makes sense.

00:43:45.159 --> 00:43:48.974
An arbitress is a judge and she
would seem to oversee the

00:43:48.974 --> 00:43:52.628
justice in this world.
The question of providential

00:43:52.628 --> 00:43:57.170
justice is of course of primary
significance to Milton's poem,

00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:00.349
but Hartman goes on to say that
the moon, which reminds us of a

00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:02.349
calm and perfect sense of
Providence,

00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:06.863
also works to guarantee the
principal of free will.So,

00:44:06.863 --> 00:44:11.455
this is my question to you:
how complete and perfect is the

00:44:11.455 --> 00:44:15.968
image of Providence that hovers
moonlike over the pages of

00:44:15.968 --> 00:44:19.161
Paradise Lost?
I think Milton is

00:44:19.161 --> 00:44:23.147
encouraging us in these similes
to question, really to wrestle

00:44:23.147 --> 00:44:25.541
with,
the theological certainties

00:44:25.541 --> 00:44:28.800
that the rest of the poem labors
to establish.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.289
The uncertain status of divine
providence here,

00:44:32.289 --> 00:44:36.309
I think, is made clear by its
figuration as a moon.

00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:39.111
So I'm going to conclude here
by reminding you what you

00:44:39.111 --> 00:44:42.657
already know.
We have already seen a moon in

00:44:42.657 --> 00:44:45.267
Book One.
The moon was compared to

00:44:45.267 --> 00:44:48.219
Satan's shield,
and Milton was preparing us

00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:51.523
then for this radically
ambiguous status of this

00:44:51.523 --> 00:44:54.757
providential moon.
It was Galileo's job,

00:44:54.757 --> 00:44:58.145
you'll remember,
with his telescope to detect

00:44:58.145 --> 00:45:02.534
the otherwise undetectable spots
and imperfections in this

00:45:02.534 --> 00:45:04.927
seemingly,
but only seemingly,

00:45:04.927 --> 00:45:07.677
perfect moon.
I'm convinced that it's the

00:45:07.677 --> 00:45:11.760
reader's job to apply the same
degree of critical scrutiny,

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.774
a kind of Galilean critical
scrutiny, to the image of

00:45:14.774 --> 00:45:16.920
Providence that will be
elaborated,

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.969
as you will see,
at extraordinary length in Book

00:45:19.969 --> 00:45:22.500
Three of Paradise
Lost.So,

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.949
for next time you'll read Book
Three.

00:45:24.949 --> 00:45:28.235
You will focus,
however, on the opening

00:45:28.235 --> 00:45:31.122
invocation.
Please do read all of the other

00:45:31.122 --> 00:45:33.291
selections as well.
You will have sonnets and

00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:37.742
little bits of prose.
We'll be talking about Milton's

00:45:37.742 --> 00:45:38.742
blindness.

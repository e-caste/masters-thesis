00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.708
Prof: Okay,
normally I would ask in a small

00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:10.310
class if there is something you
didn't follow from last time.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.838
I'm afraid to do that now,
because it's a big class and I

00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:17.430
don't know how many things you
follow or didn't follow.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.598
What I will do first is write
down a very quick summary of the

00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:23.580
main points from last time.
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.155
So you should ask yourself,
"Did I follow all those

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:28.130
things?"
 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.630
And if your answer is yes,
then you are fine.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.865
Because I talked about many,
many things,

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.710
but you don't need all of that.
 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.956
So what I'm going to write down
right now is the absolute

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:41.610
essentials of last lecture,
okay?

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.810
That's going to be needed for
what I do next.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.420
First point was:
everything is made of atoms.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.760
You know that.
 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.630
And the atom has a nucleus.
 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.939
In the nucleus are some things
called protons,

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:04.984
some things called neutrons,
and outside are some things

00:01:04.984 --> 00:01:06.530
called electrons.
 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.599
That's all the atomic structure
we need.

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:18.905
Then we say certain entities
have a property called electric

00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:20.019
charge.
 

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:24.482
The symbol for electric charge
is q, and you can put a

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:27.830
subscript to say who you are
talking about.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.560
So you can say q for the
neutron is 0.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.412
A q for the electron is
-1.6 times 10 to the -19,

00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:44.400
and it's measured in coulombs.
 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:52.364
The q for the proton is
really--let me put it this way,

00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:58.111
q for the proton is a
positive number,

00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:02.290
so these minus signs cancel.
 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.510
Now, the importance of the
coulomb is that if anything has

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.215
some coulombs on it,
it will interact with anything

00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:13.030
else that has some coulombs on
it.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.534
So that if you have two
entities and this one has a

00:02:17.534 --> 00:02:21.408
charge of q_1
coulombs,

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:24.318
that one has a charge of
q_2 coulombs,

00:02:24.318 --> 00:02:27.830
and the distance between them
is r,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.532
then the force is
q_1q

00:02:30.532 --> 00:02:34.426
_2_ over
4Πε

00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:37.050
_0r^(2).
 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.180
I'm purposely not putting all
the vector signs on F

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.980
because it takes too long,
but you all know what the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.750
answer is.
 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.560
Namely, if you want the force
on 2,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.066
due to 1, will be repulsive if
q_1 and

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:53.765
q_2 are of the
same sign and point to the

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:55.520
direction joining them.
 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.440
Yep?
 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.110
Student:  Shouldn't it
be 1 over r^(2)?

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.560
Prof: Yes, thank you.
 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.967
There is another force law
which is r^(2),

00:03:04.967 --> 00:03:06.623
not so famous,
called Hooke's Law,

00:03:06.623 --> 00:03:08.229
but you're absolutely right.
 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.889
That's the difference between
being Newton and being Hooke.

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.840
Hooke is known for the
r^(2)^( )law.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.050
Newton is known for the 1 over
r^(2)^( )law.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.500
So this is a very important
thing.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.530
If you see anything wrong you
should stop me,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.613
because when I go home,
they're going to play the video

00:03:27.613 --> 00:03:30.530
for me to watch,
and I'm going to see that

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.360
r^(2).
 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.840
There is nothing I can do until
some voice from the back says,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.508
"Hey, send it
downstairs",

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.650
and I appreciate that a lot,
okay?

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.961
It's good, so never hesitate to
do that, plus sign,

00:03:41.961 --> 00:03:44.560
minus sign, symbols;
anything that goes wrong.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.419
It also tells me that you're
following me.

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.912
So for all those reasons you
should not hesitate to correct

00:03:50.912 --> 00:03:54.404
anything, and you should not
think that you don't follow it

00:03:54.404 --> 00:03:56.090
because it's your fault.
 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.310
Probably it is.
 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.370
Sometimes it's my fault as was
demonstrated now.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.849
Okay?
 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.330
So this is the force law.
 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.280
You need only one other
ingredient.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.729
That's the superposition
principle.

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:12.973
You need that ingredient
because we're not going to be

00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:14.370
talking only about two charges.
 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.670
We're going to be talking about
many charges.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.569
And the question is:
what will they do when they're

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.141
all present,
and it's a great blessing that

00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:25.259
we have the principle of
superposition that says that if

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.117
you've got,
say, three charges,

00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:33.088
say 1,2 and 3,
you want to know the force on 3

00:04:33.088 --> 00:04:34.779
due to 2 and 1.
 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.379
You can find the force that 1
would exert.

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.399
You can find the force that 2
would exert.

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:43.204
We have two vectors,
and you can add the two vectors

00:04:43.204 --> 00:04:44.920
to get the net force.
 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.620
In other words,
the interaction between pairs

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.610
of charges is insensitive to the
presence of any other charges.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.339
They go about their business
exactly the same way.

00:04:55.339 --> 00:05:00.769
That is a principle that is not
deduced by logic.

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:01.959
You cannot say,
"Of course,

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:03.110
it had to be that way."
 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.509
That's not true.
 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:05.670
It doesn't have to be that way.
 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.377
In fact it is not that way if
you make supreme,

00:05:08.377 --> 00:05:10.730
I mean, extremely exquisite
measurements,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.910
but they occur really at the
really quantum level.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.889
For classical electromagnetic
theory it is actually an

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.120
experimental fact that you can
superpose.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.843
All right, if you combine those
things you can calculate

00:05:24.843 --> 00:05:29.110
anything and everything that we
will deal with for sometime,

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.579
but that's summary of--this is
all I said last time,

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:35.610
okay?
 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.800
Now, I didn't do one thing,
which is to emphasize to you

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.557
that the force of gravitation
divided by the electric force is

00:05:46.557 --> 00:05:49.860
some number like 10 to the -40.
 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.680
I put this twiddle here meaning
not exactly.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.550
There are factors of 1 and 2 or
10 missing,

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.600
but 10 to the -40 is roughly
the magnitude of this ratio,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.372
and it was done by comparing
the force between electron and a

00:06:04.372 --> 00:06:05.088
proton.
 

00:06:05.088 --> 00:06:07.089
It didn't matter what the
distance was because everything

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:09.696
goes like 1 over r^(2),
so when they take the ratio

00:06:09.696 --> 00:06:12.867
that cancels out,
but this was really the ratio

00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:15.709
of things like mass of the
electron,

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.516
mass of the proton,
divided by 1 over

00:06:18.516 --> 00:06:21.949
4Πε
_0;

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.149
q of the electron and
q of the proton.

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:29.560
If you put all these numbers in
you've got that.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.649
I want to mention one thing.
 

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:35.660
It may be interesting for you
to think about.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.209
Look at this nucleus.
 

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:44.939
Nucleus has a lot of protons in
it, and according to Coulomb's

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:48.470
Law they all repel each other.
 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.170
And the neutrons,
of course, don't do anything

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.509
because they have no electric
charge.

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.053
So you should ask yourself,
"Why are all these protons

00:06:57.053 --> 00:07:00.291
staying together inside the
nucleus if I don't see any

00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:02.370
attraction between them?"
 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.170
I see why the electrons are
hanging around,

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.600
because they're attracted to
the nucleus,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.240
because nucleus is positively
charged,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.166
electrons are negatively
charged, and Mr. Coulomb tells

00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:11.740
you they'll be attracted.
 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.509
What are the protons doing
together in that tiny space?

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:21.209
That space is like 10 to the
-13 centimeters.

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:24.622
So have you ever thought of
that, or does anybody know why

00:07:24.622 --> 00:07:26.240
the protons are together?
 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.120
Yes?
 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.829
Student:  The strong
nuclear force?

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:32.129
Prof: There is a strong
nuclear force.

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:33.910
Okay, that's the answer.
 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.822
In other words,
but that answer will lead to

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:39.464
more questions,
but I'll first state the

00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:40.209
answer.
 

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:42.600
There's a force even stronger
than the electric force.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.483
You see, this gives the
impression electric force is

00:07:44.483 --> 00:07:45.000
very strong.
 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.694
It is much stronger than
gravity, but there is a force

00:07:48.694 --> 00:07:52.807
even stronger than the electric
force that is experienced by

00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:54.759
protons and by neutrons.
 

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:57.940
In other words there is another
charge which is not electric

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.067
charge, which the protons are
endowed with and the neutrons

00:08:01.067 --> 00:08:02.199
are endowed with.
 

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:04.548
And the force due to that
charge, if you like,

00:08:04.548 --> 00:08:07.000
it's not called charge but it's
a similar thing,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.410
is much, much stronger.
 

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.862
It had to be,
because you have to beat the

00:08:11.862 --> 00:08:13.800
electrical repulsion.
 

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.670
So then you can ask yourself,
"Well,

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.543
in that case,
how did we ever find the

00:08:18.543 --> 00:08:22.504
electrical force,"
because here's another force

00:08:22.504 --> 00:08:26.000
even stronger than the
electrical force,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.040
maybe a thousand times stronger.
 

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.178
Then why wasn't it completely
overshadowing the electrical

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:32.759
force?
 

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:33.730
Yep?
 

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.700
Student:  It's
irrelevant over larger

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.250
distances.
 

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.870
Prof: Yes,
so let me repeat what he said.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.360
It has to do with what's called
the range of the force.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.298
In other words,
look at two different

00:08:44.298 --> 00:08:45.269
functions, okay?
 

00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:55.548
One function looks like 1 over
137 times 1 over r^(2).

00:08:55.548 --> 00:09:01.241
Other function looks like 10
times e to the -r

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:06.259
over r_0
divided by r^(2);

00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:12.841
r_0 is some
length, and the length is

00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:18.552
roughly 10 to the -13
centimeters, or 10 to -15

00:09:18.552 --> 00:09:19.918
meters.
 

00:09:19.918 --> 00:09:24.221
Which force are you more
impressed with is the question,

00:09:24.221 --> 00:09:24.769
okay?
 

00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:27.663
If r is much bigger than
r_0,

00:09:27.663 --> 00:09:30.445
say 10 times bigger,
you've got e to the -10

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.278
on the top.
 

00:09:31.278 --> 00:09:32.730
e to the -10 is a small
number.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.548
e to the -3 is like 1
over 20.

00:09:35.548 --> 00:09:38.759
e to the -10 is 1 over
20 cubed.

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:43.140
So then what will happen is,
this force, even though there's

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.374
a number 10 in front of it,
will be negligible compared to

00:09:47.374 --> 00:09:48.340
this one.
 

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.793
Whereas if r is much
smaller than

00:09:49.793 --> 00:09:51.442
r_0,
say, r is .1 of

00:09:51.442 --> 00:09:53.568
r_0,
so you can forget this number,

00:09:53.568 --> 00:09:55.490
e to the minus point is
roughly 1,

00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:00.519
then this 10 will dominate the
1 over 100.

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:03.072
So what happens is,
if you're sitting inside the

00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:05.312
nucleus,
the nuclear force is

00:10:05.312 --> 00:10:08.870
numerically strong,
not only because of the number

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.447
in front of it,
but also because this

00:10:11.447 --> 00:10:14.230
exponential factor has not
kicked in.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:19.241
Therefore, the protons feel an
attraction for each other due to

00:10:19.241 --> 00:10:23.769
the nuclear force that is
stronger than the repulsion due

00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:25.788
to the coulomb force.
 

00:10:25.788 --> 00:10:29.658
And the neutrons attract the
protons just as much as the

00:10:29.658 --> 00:10:34.158
protons attract the protons with
respect to the nuclear force.

00:10:34.158 --> 00:10:38.001
So neutrons are actually good,
because when you throw an extra

00:10:38.001 --> 00:10:41.970
neutron into an atom you don't
add to the coulomb repulsion,

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.900
but you add to the overall
attraction that they all feel

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.139
for each other due to the
nuclear force.

00:10:47.139 --> 00:10:49.178
So neutrons are like the glue.
 

00:10:49.178 --> 00:10:52.067
As you add more and more
protons, you will find that

00:10:52.067 --> 00:10:55.297
you've got to add more and more
neutrons to compensate the

00:10:55.297 --> 00:10:56.600
coulomb attraction.
 

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.058
But a time will come when the
nucleus becomes so big,

00:11:01.058 --> 00:11:03.649
that even if you add enough
neutrons,

00:11:03.649 --> 00:11:06.932
the repulsion between protons
from one end of the nucleus to

00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:10.102
the other is now becoming
comparable to the attraction due

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:13.918
to the nuclear force,
because nucleus has become so

00:11:13.918 --> 00:11:17.269
big this factor is no longer
negligible.

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:20.222
See, over long distances a
coulomb force will always

00:11:20.222 --> 00:11:22.226
triumph,
because no matter what the

00:11:22.226 --> 00:11:24.942
prefactors are,
the exponential factor in front

00:11:24.942 --> 00:11:27.528
of the nuclear force will always
weaken it.

00:11:27.528 --> 00:11:31.019
That's why you cannot have
nuclei beyond some size.

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:33.779
If you make them any bigger,
the nuclear electrical

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:36.759
repulsion between the distant
parts of the protons,

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:39.320
due to the distant protons in
the nucleus,

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.798
cannot be compensated by the
short-range attraction.

00:11:42.798 --> 00:11:45.803
So it's the range of the
interaction that is a

00:11:45.803 --> 00:11:47.538
significant factor here.
 

00:11:47.538 --> 00:11:51.416
So all the strong forces are
strong, but at short distances

00:11:51.416 --> 00:11:55.493
the coulomb force is not that
strong, but it falls like 1 over

00:11:55.493 --> 00:11:56.629
r^(2).
 

00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:58.446
Now gravity,
on the other hand,

00:11:58.446 --> 00:12:01.230
is exactly 1 over
r^(2)^( )with a number

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.245
that's much,
much, much smaller than this,

00:12:04.245 --> 00:12:08.558
but then we saw the other day
why gravity managed to survive,

00:12:08.558 --> 00:12:10.336
because this is
q_1q

00:12:10.336 --> 00:12:12.947
_2 and the
q's can be added

00:12:12.947 --> 00:12:15.168
algebraically and cancel each
other.

00:12:15.168 --> 00:12:16.543
Whereas if you've got
m_1m

00:12:16.543 --> 00:12:18.822
_2_ over
r^(2)^( )there is no way

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:19.798
to cancel the m.
 

00:12:19.798 --> 00:12:23.735
This is how the different
forces manage to survive for the

00:12:23.735 --> 00:12:25.528
different reasons,
okay?

00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:29.485
Nuclear wins in the nuclear
zone, but dies very quickly

00:12:29.485 --> 00:12:31.830
outside the size of a nucleus.
 

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.907
Electrical forces falls more
slowly at like 1 over

00:12:34.907 --> 00:12:35.850
r^(2).
 

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.572
They dominate atomic physics,
but once you formed an atom

00:12:38.572 --> 00:12:41.200
you've got pretty much an
electrical neutral thing,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.072
and once you've got many,
many atoms making up our

00:12:44.072 --> 00:12:46.423
planet,
then all that remains is the

00:12:46.423 --> 00:12:50.330
gravitational attraction between
a planet and another planet.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.767
Okay, so these are examples of
different forces and why they

00:12:54.767 --> 00:12:59.203
were found at various times,
because they all dominate under

00:12:59.203 --> 00:13:01.308
different circumstances.
 

00:13:01.308 --> 00:13:06.649
All right, so today I'm going
to start with my new stuff.

00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:09.245
So all you need to know,
really, if you want to do your

00:13:09.245 --> 00:13:11.899
problem sets and your homework,
is Coulomb's Law,

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:15.320
you know, how to stick the
numbers in the Coulomb's Law.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.275
And the only thing I didn't
mention is this 1 over

00:13:18.275 --> 00:13:21.533
4Πε
_0 is 9 times 10

00:13:21.533 --> 00:13:22.620
to the 9^(th).
 

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.062
So today we're going to do
something which is a part of a

00:13:27.062 --> 00:13:32.138
great abstraction and it goes as
follows: So I'm gong to take two

00:13:32.138 --> 00:13:36.432
charges,
a q_1 here and

00:13:36.432 --> 00:13:40.878
q_2 here,
and I'm going to give them some

00:13:40.878 --> 00:13:41.408
locations.
 

00:13:41.408 --> 00:13:47.586
So let's say this guy is at
vector r_1,

00:13:47.586 --> 00:13:52.639
this one is at vector
r_2.

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:55.788
Now, I will really take are of
all the arrows.

00:13:55.788 --> 00:14:00.628
This one is
r_2 -

00:14:00.628 --> 00:14:06.639
r_1,
that arrow there.

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:09.246
You can check that I didn't
mess up anything,

00:14:09.246 --> 00:14:12.211
because r_1
r_2 -

00:14:12.211 --> 00:14:15.528
r_1 should be
r_2.

00:14:15.528 --> 00:14:19.470
So let's write the coulomb
force now as a vector.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:24.811
And you've got to say force on
what, so I'm going to say force

00:14:24.811 --> 00:14:26.298
on 2, due to 1.
 

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:28.970
Now, you've got to realize it's
a convention.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:32.601
So I use a convention:
This is the force on this guy

00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:36.519
and the force due to this guy,
with the second later.

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:39.379
Now, let's write it out in
detail.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.388
So that is
q_1 over

00:14:42.388 --> 00:14:45.538
4Πε
_0.

00:14:45.538 --> 00:14:47.710
I'm going to put the
q_2 here.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:52.023
Then here I want to write
(r_1 -

00:14:52.023 --> 00:14:54.538
r_2)^(2).
 

00:14:54.538 --> 00:14:57.750
That's the 1 over r^(2),
but then I have to make it a

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.240
vector.
 

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.850
So for the vector part,
once you have the magnitude of

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.741
the vector,
you should multiply by vector

00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:08.070
of length unit 1 going in the
direction of this difference

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:08.830
vector.
 

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.070
So you can use any symbol you
like.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.298
One is to say
e_12.

00:15:14.298 --> 00:15:17.990
e's always going to be
unit vector going from 1 to 2,

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.014
or if you're inclined you can
also write

00:15:21.014 --> 00:15:25.126
e_12 as
r_2 -

00:15:25.126 --> 00:15:28.539
r_1 divided by
the length of

00:15:28.539 --> 00:15:32.419
r_2 -
r_1.

00:15:32.419 --> 00:15:34.919
They're all unit vectors.
 

00:15:34.919 --> 00:15:35.720
Now, do you follow that?
 

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.100
I mean, are you having trouble
with unit vectors?

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.850
Anytime I have a vector
pointing from here to there,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.168
I want to give a magnitude and
direction.

00:15:45.168 --> 00:15:48.457
The magnitude in this case is 1
over the distance squared,

00:15:48.457 --> 00:15:51.861
but you have to append to it a
vector of unit length in that

00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:52.668
direction.
 

00:15:52.668 --> 00:15:55.490
That's what makes it into a
vector.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:00.053
For example,
suppose I want to describe that

00:16:00.053 --> 00:16:04.620
vector r,
and it is 7 meters long?

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.379
I cannot write r = 7,
because that doesn't tell you

00:16:07.379 --> 00:16:08.639
which way it's pointing.
 

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:12.235
So invent the vector called
i, which is a unit vector

00:16:12.235 --> 00:16:15.100
in the x direction and I
multiply it by that.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.241
So 7i is a vector
parallel to i and 7 times

00:16:19.241 --> 00:16:19.759
long.
 

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:25.806
7.3i is a vector
parallel to i 7.3 times

00:16:25.806 --> 00:16:27.288
long, okay?
 

00:16:27.288 --> 00:16:30.347
So you need to add a vector of
unit length to the magnitude,

00:16:30.347 --> 00:16:32.370
multiply it to get the actual
vector.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.110
So that's that formula.
 

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.970
Then if you have many charges,
I'm not going to do that now,

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.168
say one more here,
it'll exert a force on

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:43.839
q_2,
but you've got to add to the

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:44.610
force due to 1.
 

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:45.240
I'm not going to do that.
 

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.500
I'm just taking two guys.
 

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:56.847
Now, I'm going to formally
write this as equal to the

00:16:56.847 --> 00:17:03.750
electric field at
r_2 times

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:12.259
q_2,
and this is called a field.

00:17:12.259 --> 00:17:14.220
You see, if you look at this
thing,

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.258
all I've done is rewrite the
expression as something that

00:17:17.258 --> 00:17:19.807
involves a charge of
q�_2 and

00:17:19.807 --> 00:17:23.117
everything else that involves
the q_1 and the

00:17:23.117 --> 00:17:25.125
distance from
q_1 and

00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:26.700
q_2.
 

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.890
So it looks like there's no
real content to giving this

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.048
object a name,
but it's a very profound

00:17:34.048 --> 00:17:38.720
notion, so I've got to tell you
the story that goes with it.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.308
In Coulomb's Law you say that
q_1 and

00:17:42.308 --> 00:17:45.559
q_2 exert a
force on each other,

00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:46.170
okay?
 

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.136
And the force depends on the
charge and the distance between

00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:49.490
them.
 

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:53.597
Now I'm going to say
q_1 produces an

00:17:53.597 --> 00:17:58.496
electric field at the location
of q_2 given by

00:17:58.496 --> 00:18:01.674
this vector,
and when I multiply by

00:18:01.674 --> 00:18:05.346
q_2 it gives me
the force on

00:18:05.346 --> 00:18:07.348
q_2.
 

00:18:07.348 --> 00:18:10.890
Now, what's the importance of
the electric field?

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.577
Whereas q_1
and q_2 exist

00:18:14.577 --> 00:18:17.757
only at these two places,
the electric field can be

00:18:17.757 --> 00:18:19.220
defined everywhere.
 

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:23.207
It doesn't require a second
charge because you see,

00:18:23.207 --> 00:18:26.635
this number you can compute for
any value of

00:18:26.635 --> 00:18:28.630
r_2.
 

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:33.530
So the picture we have is that
q_1 produces an

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.710
electric field all over space,
and q_2

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.308
experiences that field and gets
repelled as a result,

00:18:41.308 --> 00:18:46.766
and the force it feels is the
field at that point times

00:18:46.766 --> 00:18:49.088
q_2.
 

00:18:49.088 --> 00:18:54.798
In general, we say there's an
electric field at this point in

00:18:54.798 --> 00:18:55.558
space.
 

00:18:55.558 --> 00:19:00.576
If you put a charge q
there it should experience a

00:19:00.576 --> 00:19:04.338
force q times the
electric field.

00:19:04.338 --> 00:19:06.800
So to understand this,
the charges are only in two

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.911
places in our example,
but the field due to

00:19:08.911 --> 00:19:10.868
q_1 is
everywhere.

00:19:10.868 --> 00:19:14.542
At every point in space I can
compute a field due to

00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:16.200
q_1.
 

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.241
So the field,
you can see,

00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:23.144
will turn into a force if you
multiply it by a charge you put

00:19:23.144 --> 00:19:25.838
at the location of the field.
 

00:19:25.838 --> 00:19:28.452
So if you've got one charge
here, I claim there's a field

00:19:28.452 --> 00:19:31.558
here, there's field there;
there's a field everywhere due

00:19:31.558 --> 00:19:32.338
to this guy.
 

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:35.112
How do I know,
because if you put a test

00:19:35.112 --> 00:19:37.598
charge it begins to feel a
force.

00:19:37.598 --> 00:19:41.493
So one way to say it,
is that the field is the force

00:19:41.493 --> 00:19:44.930
on a unit charge you put at that
location,

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:48.345
unit charge because if
q_2 is equal to

00:19:48.345 --> 00:19:52.140
1 then numerically E is
exactly equal to the force.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.845
If I go to you and say,
"Find out the electric

00:19:54.845 --> 00:19:56.358
field at this point."
 

00:19:56.358 --> 00:19:57.039
You say, "Okay,
where?"

00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:58.519
I say, "Here."
 

00:19:58.519 --> 00:20:02.769
What do you think you have to
do to measure the field?

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:04.200
Yes?
 

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.117
Student:  Add up all the
forces on that field from the

00:20:07.117 --> 00:20:09.452
different charges,
or add up all of the fields at

00:20:09.452 --> 00:20:10.279
that point...
 

00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:10.680
Prof: No, okay.
 

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.063
Her answer was,
"If I want the field here,

00:20:13.063 --> 00:20:15.601
I should find out where all the
charges are,"

00:20:15.601 --> 00:20:16.118
right?
 

00:20:16.118 --> 00:20:18.746
"Find all the forces they
will exert on this guy,

00:20:18.746 --> 00:20:20.680
on the unit charge here,"
right?

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.778
But I'm telling you,
that's correct.

00:20:22.778 --> 00:20:25.439
That's the theoretical way to
calculate the field at that

00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:28.144
point, but suppose you're an
experimentalist and you don't

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:29.759
want to know what produced it.
 

00:20:29.759 --> 00:20:33.309
You just want an answer to
what's the field here.

00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:34.940
What will you do?
 

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.519
Yes?
 

00:20:35.519 --> 00:20:36.799
Student:  Place a test
charge.

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:37.950
Prof: Okay, and then?
 

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:41.009
Student:  And then see
what happens to it.

00:20:41.009 --> 00:20:44.221
Prof: By `see what
happens', you've got to be

00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:46.865
more--so his answer was:
put a test charge,

00:20:46.865 --> 00:20:48.440
and see what happens.
 

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.160
Now, you've got to be more
precise.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.854
I think you know what you
meant, but I want you to finish

00:20:53.854 --> 00:20:54.910
that sentence.
 

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:55.666
Student:  Okay.
 

00:20:55.666 --> 00:20:57.836
Well, you can measure the force
by measuring the acceleration on

00:20:57.836 --> 00:20:58.319
the charge.
 

00:20:58.319 --> 00:20:58.859
Prof: Very good.
 

00:20:58.859 --> 00:20:59.490
See, that's what I want.
 

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.640
When you said,
"See what happens,"

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.740
does it get married?
 

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.897
Does it have children?
 

00:21:03.897 --> 00:21:05.528
That's not what I meant,
okay?

00:21:05.528 --> 00:21:07.210
But you did give the right
answer.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.042
The answer was,
by `see what happens',

00:21:10.042 --> 00:21:14.178
you put the charge there,
and you see what acceleration

00:21:14.178 --> 00:21:15.480
it undergoes.
 

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.625
Then that acceleration is
the--that times the mass is the

00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:21.548
force it's experiencing.
 

00:21:21.548 --> 00:21:25.038
That should be q that
you place there times E.

00:21:25.038 --> 00:21:27.480
If q was 1 that force
itself is equal to E.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:33.394
If q was 10 you've got
to divide the force by 10 to get

00:21:33.394 --> 00:21:35.140
the field there.
 

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:40.730
So, the field is like the sound
of one hand clapping.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.720
People say one hand clapping is
Zen concept, but the field is

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.411
like that, because you don't
need two charges to have a

00:21:46.411 --> 00:21:46.910
field.
 

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.029
You just need one charge.
 

00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:50.880
So here is how we understand
that.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.578
You put a charge q.
 

00:21:54.578 --> 00:21:58.308
If you go here something has
happened there,

00:21:58.308 --> 00:21:58.828
see?
 

00:21:58.828 --> 00:22:00.790
You don't need to put a second
charge there to conclude

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.700
something has happened.
 

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:06.160
Something really is different
at this location because the

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.430
charge q is present.
 

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.598
What is different?
 

00:22:09.598 --> 00:22:13.292
What is different is that when
this guy was not here and I put

00:22:13.292 --> 00:22:15.108
a charge, it just sat there.
 

00:22:15.108 --> 00:22:19.560
Whereas when this guy is here
and I put a charge,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.880
it experiences a force.
 

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.711
So if you put a 1 coulomb here
it experiences a force which is

00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:29.711
1 times the field at that point,
therefore, this charge has

00:22:29.711 --> 00:22:35.920
distorted the space around it,
in fact, everywhere.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.910
Now, if you've got many,
many, many charges,

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.018
then they will all try to
produce a force on a unit charge

00:22:43.018 --> 00:22:44.856
and you should,
like you said,

00:22:44.856 --> 00:22:47.916
add up the vectors,
which are the forces due to all

00:22:47.916 --> 00:22:50.548
the other charges on that one
location,

00:22:50.548 --> 00:22:54.308
on a test charge on that
location.

00:22:54.308 --> 00:23:01.010
So the field is the sum of the
field due to all the charges at

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.440
that point.
 

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:10.309
Now, Coulomb's Law doesn't work
when charges are moving.

00:23:10.309 --> 00:23:11.108
Why is that?
 

00:23:11.108 --> 00:23:15.769
Have you any idea why you
cannot use it?

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:16.450
Yes?
 

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.390
Student:  The radius is
changing?

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.880
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.608
Student:  r is
changing?

00:23:19.608 --> 00:23:22.875
Prof: r is
changing so we'll keep changing

00:23:22.875 --> 00:23:25.797
it as the charge moves,
but it's only an approximation

00:23:25.797 --> 00:23:26.670
when charges move.
 

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:30.299
Do you know why?
 

00:23:30.299 --> 00:23:31.528
Yep?
 

00:23:31.528 --> 00:23:34.578
Student:  There's a
magnetic field?

00:23:34.578 --> 00:23:36.016
Prof: True,
but even the electric

00:23:36.016 --> 00:23:37.490
field--his answer was magnetic
field,

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.259
but even the electric field is
not properly given.

00:23:40.259 --> 00:23:41.308
Yes?
 

00:23:41.308 --> 00:23:44.790
Student:  Is the
electric field affected by

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.348
something like the Doppler
Effect?

00:23:47.348 --> 00:23:50.440
Prof: Not the Doppler,
something else.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.420
If Coulomb's Law were exact,
okay?

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.108
Here is what I can do.
 

00:23:55.108 --> 00:23:59.539
You take a coulomb and you sit
at the other end of the galaxy.

00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:01.538
I have a coulomb here.
 

00:24:01.538 --> 00:24:03.847
You know the force my coulomb
exerts on yours because it's

00:24:03.847 --> 00:24:04.740
pushing against you.
 

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.630
You hold it.
 

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.470
Now suddenly I move my coulomb
away from you by a tiny amount.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.740
What will you feel?
 

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.910
You will feel the force is
reduced.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.108
Yes?
 

00:24:14.108 --> 00:24:15.309
Student:  Relativity
is...

00:24:15.309 --> 00:24:18.015
Prof: Yes,
so the special theory does not

00:24:18.015 --> 00:24:20.787
allow that,
because I have managed to

00:24:20.787 --> 00:24:24.008
communicate with you,
arbitrarily far,

00:24:24.008 --> 00:24:25.410
instantaneously.
 

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.808
The minute I move this charge,
you know about it,

00:24:27.808 --> 00:24:29.460
because your charge moved away.
 

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.866
For example,
if your charge was connected to

00:24:31.866 --> 00:24:33.670
a spring,
and it had been extended to

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.220
some amount because of this
charge,

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.318
the minute I move it your
spring will move.

00:24:38.318 --> 00:24:42.477
That instantaneous
communication is forbidden by

00:24:42.477 --> 00:24:46.368
the special theory,
so it does not happen.

00:24:46.368 --> 00:24:50.163
So the correct way to do it,
it'll maybe come later in the

00:24:50.163 --> 00:24:52.644
course,
so probably not even at the end

00:24:52.644 --> 00:24:55.830
of this course,
but the proper way to do that

00:24:55.830 --> 00:25:00.440
is to in the end realize that
the electric field at this point

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.519
is not only due to what the
charges are doing now,

00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:07.210
but what they were doing in the
past.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.430
Because if some charge at the
other end of the galaxy did

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.538
something it takes some time,
namely traveling at the speed

00:25:13.538 --> 00:25:16.853
of light,
to carry that information from

00:25:16.853 --> 00:25:18.269
there to here.
 

00:25:18.269 --> 00:25:21.435
So it's the delayed response to
all the motion in the charges

00:25:21.435 --> 00:25:23.970
that you've got to add to find
the field here.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.394
That's what makes the
computation of the electric

00:25:26.394 --> 00:25:27.910
field much more complicated.
 

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:31.509
But if you promise me charges
never move then the location now

00:25:31.509 --> 00:25:34.999
is the location last year,
the location a million years

00:25:34.999 --> 00:25:37.348
ago, then you can use Coulomb's
Law.

00:25:37.348 --> 00:25:39.473
Coulomb's Law is good for
electrostatics,

00:25:39.473 --> 00:25:42.660
but in real life charges are
moving, so you cannot really use

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.509
the formula.
 

00:25:43.509 --> 00:25:45.612
Now, in our room,
if you put a charge here and

00:25:45.612 --> 00:25:47.386
another charge there,
if you move this,

00:25:47.386 --> 00:25:49.769
that guy will move pretty much
instantaneously.

00:25:49.769 --> 00:25:52.567
That's because the time it
takes a light signal to go from

00:25:52.567 --> 00:25:54.776
here to there is so small,
you may treat it as

00:25:54.776 --> 00:25:55.660
instantaneous.
 

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.108
So Coulomb's Law is used in
electrical circuits and so on.

00:25:58.108 --> 00:26:01.330
You don't worry about the time
of transit because it's too

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.449
small,
but over longer distances,

00:26:03.449 --> 00:26:06.544
where the time it takes for
light to travel becomes

00:26:06.544 --> 00:26:09.750
non-negligible,
you cannot use Coulomb's Law.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.670
It's not wrong.
 

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.259
It is not appropriate when
charges are moving.

00:26:14.259 --> 00:26:20.237
However, it will always be true
that if you go to any one point

00:26:20.237 --> 00:26:26.310
the force on any charge q
you put there is q times

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:31.078
electric field at that point,
okay?

00:26:31.078 --> 00:26:33.938
So the electric field notion
survives because it doesn't

00:26:33.938 --> 00:26:35.029
violate relativity.
 

00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:38.433
It says if the field here is so
much q will experience

00:26:38.433 --> 00:26:41.497
the force q times
E, but the complication

00:26:41.497 --> 00:26:43.200
is what is the field here?
 

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.707
Well, it's due to everybody
else, and it's not only due to

00:26:46.707 --> 00:26:49.569
everybody else right now,
but everybody else from the

00:26:49.569 --> 00:26:52.063
dawn of time because things have
been moving and shaking and

00:26:52.063 --> 00:26:53.118
sending signals to us.
 

00:26:53.118 --> 00:26:56.750
We collect all that and see
what lands here at this instant.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.920
That decides the field here.
 

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.750
So that's the computation of
the field, but the response to

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:02.970
the field is very easy.
 

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.873
You put a test charge;
q times E is the

00:27:06.873 --> 00:27:07.650
answer.
 

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.946
So in modern physics,
in theories that are compatible

00:27:10.946 --> 00:27:14.434
with the special theory of
relativity we break the force

00:27:14.434 --> 00:27:15.640
into two parts.
 

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.390
Charges don't immediately
interact with other charges.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.346
Charges produce a field,
and the field may even

00:27:22.346 --> 00:27:26.460
propagate outwards at the speed
of light if you make motions,

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.339
but another charge at the
location of that particular

00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:32.000
point will respond to the field
at that point.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.098
So it's not responding to the
charge right now.

00:27:34.098 --> 00:27:38.025
It's responding to the field
this charge produced at its

00:27:38.025 --> 00:27:38.808
location.
 

00:27:38.808 --> 00:27:41.577
So all of electromagnetic
theory is going to contain two

00:27:41.577 --> 00:27:41.980
parts.
 

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.243
The first part is,
find the field due to this

00:27:44.243 --> 00:27:46.761
charge configuration,
that charge configuration,

00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:49.641
maybe due to various currents,
and the second part is,

00:27:49.641 --> 00:27:53.338
given the field,
find the response of charges to

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:54.288
the field.
 

00:27:54.288 --> 00:27:57.038
So you understand charges play
a double role.

00:27:57.038 --> 00:28:00.848
They are the producers of the
field.

00:28:00.848 --> 00:28:03.828
They are also the ones who
respond to the field.

00:28:03.828 --> 00:28:06.019
If you don't have a charge you
cannot produce field.

00:28:06.019 --> 00:28:08.078
If you don't have a charge you
cannot experience it,

00:28:08.078 --> 00:28:09.210
you cannot play that game.
 

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.449
To gain membership into
electrostatic interactions

00:28:12.449 --> 00:28:14.298
you've got to have charge.
 

00:28:14.298 --> 00:28:17.190
So neutrons cannot do that,
but they can do other things.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:20.556
Like I said,
they take part in nuclear

00:28:20.556 --> 00:28:24.650
force, in fact,
just as well as protons do.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:29.289
All right, so let's go back now
to the simplest problem in the

00:28:29.289 --> 00:28:32.789
world: the electric field due to
one charge.

00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:34.470
The formula is very simple.
 

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.710
Let's put that charge at the
origin.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:40.064
And the electric field due to 1
charge is q over

00:28:40.064 --> 00:28:42.858
4Πε
_0,

00:28:42.858 --> 00:28:47.160
1 over r^(2) if you're
here,

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.880
and that's your r vector.
 

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.460
The field at this point is that
magnitude,

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.211
and I'm going to write
e_r_

00:28:55.211 --> 00:28:58.960
meaning a vector of unit
length in the radial direction.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.490
Once again, I will tell you if
you want, you can write that as

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.732
the position vector divided by
the length of the position

00:29:05.732 --> 00:29:06.369
vector.
 

00:29:06.369 --> 00:29:09.088
They're equivalent ways.
 

00:29:09.088 --> 00:29:11.443
If I write it the second way,
you've got to be a little

00:29:11.443 --> 00:29:11.880
careful.
 

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.863
It'll look like qr over
4Πε

00:29:15.863 --> 00:29:18.150
_0r^(3).
 

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.557
Don't get fooled into thinking
the field is falling at 1 over

00:29:21.557 --> 00:29:22.410
r^(3).
 

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.819
It's really 1 over
r^(2)^( )because there's

00:29:25.819 --> 00:29:27.558
an r on the top.
 

00:29:27.558 --> 00:29:30.108
See, if you write it as 1 over
r^(2) put unit vector.

00:29:30.108 --> 00:29:32.681
If you write it as 1 over
r^(3 )put the position

00:29:32.681 --> 00:29:33.108
vector.
 

00:29:33.108 --> 00:29:36.349
They're all saying the same
thing.

00:29:36.349 --> 00:29:39.048
So here you have this formula.
 

00:29:39.048 --> 00:29:41.675
If you're a person who likes to
work with formulas this is all

00:29:41.675 --> 00:29:42.150
you need.
 

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:45.700
You manipulate the stuff on
paper, and you add different

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.539
fields, but people like to
visualize this.

00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:50.450
So how do I visualize this?
 

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:52.200
That's the real question.
 

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.880
So here's a very popular method
for visualizing this formula.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.480
You know, you've got,
for example--suppose someone

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.743
asks you, what's the height
above ground level of a certain

00:30:04.743 --> 00:30:06.950
part of the United States?
 

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:07.789
Okay, you've got some mountains.
 

00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:09.220
You've got some valleys.
 

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.115
Well, somebody can give you a
function that gives you the

00:30:12.115 --> 00:30:14.390
height at any point in the
United States,

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.751
but it's more interesting to
have some kind of a contour map

00:30:17.751 --> 00:30:19.828
that looks like this,
right?

00:30:19.828 --> 00:30:21.808
And all these contours are
different heights.

00:30:21.808 --> 00:30:23.838
If you've gone hiking,
you can see those maps.

00:30:23.838 --> 00:30:27.008
They tell you pictorially what
a certain function is trying to

00:30:27.008 --> 00:30:27.578
tell you.
 

00:30:27.578 --> 00:30:32.569
So you want a pictorial
representation of this electric

00:30:32.569 --> 00:30:33.308
field.
 

00:30:33.308 --> 00:30:37.104
It's very easy to write down
the electric field at one point,

00:30:37.104 --> 00:30:40.519
namely you take that point,
you draw an arrow there;

00:30:40.519 --> 00:30:41.588
E.
 

00:30:41.588 --> 00:30:45.450
That E is the electric
field at that point.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.670
So we try to do our best by
saying here is my test charge.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.373
I'm going to pick a few points,
four points,

00:30:51.373 --> 00:30:54.013
maybe eight,
and I'm going to tell you what

00:30:54.013 --> 00:30:56.088
the field is at those points.
 

00:30:56.088 --> 00:30:58.538
At this point it looks like
that.

00:30:58.538 --> 00:31:00.210
At this point it looks like
that.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:05.828
Here it looks like this.
 

00:31:05.828 --> 00:31:09.980
That's already telling you
something.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.618
You've got to be very careful
on the interpretation.

00:31:12.618 --> 00:31:16.233
This arrow is not telling you
what's happening throughout the

00:31:16.233 --> 00:31:17.558
length of the arrow.
 

00:31:17.558 --> 00:31:19.519
It's telling you what's
happening at the tip.

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:21.799
You understand the arrow is in
your mind.

00:31:21.799 --> 00:31:22.480
It's a vector.
 

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.759
It's not really sticking out in
space.

00:31:24.759 --> 00:31:26.978
It's a property at a condition
at that point,

00:31:26.978 --> 00:31:29.548
but we've got to draw it,
so we draw it that way.

00:31:29.548 --> 00:31:33.458
It doesn't tell you the state
of affairs over its length,

00:31:33.458 --> 00:31:36.598
but only at its tip,
at the starting point.

00:31:36.598 --> 00:31:39.250
Then you can say,
"Okay, what happens when I

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.519
go further out?"
 

00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:42.703
When I go further out,
say over here,

00:31:42.703 --> 00:31:46.040
it's going to be still--if I
put a test charge here it's

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.440
still going to be repelled
radially, but a lot less.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.009
So I do that.
 

00:31:53.009 --> 00:31:58.651
So I draw arrows at other
representative points and make

00:31:58.651 --> 00:32:00.190
them shorter.
 

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.605
In fact, the length of the
arrow will be 1 over

00:32:03.605 --> 00:32:04.720
r^(2).
 

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.298
So you can do this, okay?
 

00:32:08.298 --> 00:32:12.089
But now where all do you want
to draw these arrows?

00:32:12.089 --> 00:32:12.980
It's up to you.
 

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:13.838
You pick a few points.
 

00:32:13.838 --> 00:32:16.630
You go to another radius,
you draw more arrows.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.240
Someone had this clever idea of
doing the following.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.630
You can probably guess.
 

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:31.788
Their idea was when I join all
these arrows like that,

00:32:31.788 --> 00:32:41.640
now if you go to a point like
this, what have I gained and

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.269
what have I lost?
 

00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:48.299
What more information have I
got when I join the arrows?

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:49.640
Yes.
 

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.903
Student:  The more
information is that now you know

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:54.165
the direction that it will
continue on forever if no other

00:32:54.165 --> 00:32:56.442
forces act on it,
and what you've lost is the

00:32:56.442 --> 00:32:57.118
magnitude...
 

00:32:57.118 --> 00:32:59.180
Prof: Okay,
let me repeat that.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.558
That's what you guys should
have been thinking in your head.

00:33:02.558 --> 00:33:04.568
When I joined these lines--by
the way,

00:33:04.568 --> 00:33:09.130
I do want you to anticipate
what I'm going to say,

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:13.200
because if I'm struck by
lightning,

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.920
another electromagnetic
phenomenon,

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.700
can you even complete my...
 

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:19.900
Student (Chorus):
 Sentence!

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.180
Prof: Sentence, right.
 

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:25.204
Okay, now you should be able to
go a little beyond if I'm doing

00:33:25.204 --> 00:33:26.180
a derivation.
 

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.960
You've got to be following me,
right?

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.690
That's very important.
 

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.118
It's got to be active.
 

00:33:30.118 --> 00:33:33.910
And I sat through a lecture
yesterday for an hour.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.190
I know it's a very long time.
 

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.509
This is what,
an hour and fifteen minutes?

00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:42.782
The only way you can survive
this is if you somehow make it

00:33:42.782 --> 00:33:44.108
an active event.
 

00:33:44.108 --> 00:33:47.240
You've got to do something that
keeps you awake during the

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:47.788
process.
 

00:33:47.788 --> 00:33:50.602
One of them is to anticipate
what I will do next in a

00:33:50.602 --> 00:33:51.358
calculation.
 

00:33:51.358 --> 00:33:54.060
That'll make sure also that
you're on top of it,

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.589
that'll make sure that you
catch mistakes.

00:33:56.589 --> 00:33:58.460
Okay.
 

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.288
All right, so here are these
lines.

00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:03.361
As she said quite correctly,
previously I knew the field

00:34:03.361 --> 00:34:05.538
direction only at the chosen
points,

00:34:05.538 --> 00:34:08.409
but now I know it throughout
this line,

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:12.199
but I've lost information on
the magnitude of the field,

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:14.809
because the arrows--there are
no lengths of anything.

00:34:14.809 --> 00:34:16.309
These arrows don't have any
length.

00:34:16.309 --> 00:34:18.829
In fact, you can keep drawing
more lines if you like.

00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:22.940
They go like that in all
directions.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.601
It basically tells you,
hey, the charge is pushing

00:34:25.601 --> 00:34:28.320
everything out radially no
matter where you are.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.670
That's the thrust of this
picture.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:36.619
But, due to the miraculous
property of the coulomb force,

00:34:36.619 --> 00:34:39.800
namely that it falls like 1
over r^(2),

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.994
there is information even on
the strength of the electric

00:34:44.994 --> 00:34:47.751
field,
and that information is

00:34:47.751 --> 00:34:51.929
contained in the density of
electric field lines.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:53.550
And I'll tell you precisely
what I mean.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:57.190
So, here is the charge.
 

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:03.057
Take a sphere of radius
r and here are all these

00:35:03.057 --> 00:35:04.579
lines going.
 

00:35:04.579 --> 00:35:14.552
By density of lines,
I mean the number of lines

00:35:14.552 --> 00:35:24.307
crossing a surface perpendicular
to the lines,

00:35:24.307 --> 00:35:32.980
divided by the area of that
surface.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:37.925
Because let's make a convention
that we will draw for every

00:35:37.925 --> 00:35:42.617
coulomb a certain number of
lines, 32 lines per coulomb,

00:35:42.617 --> 00:35:44.920
32 lines are going out.
 

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:50.860
I draw a sphere of some radius,
32 lines cross that sphere.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:55.570
I draw a bigger sphere,
32 lines cross this sphere

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.117
also,
but they're less dense,

00:35:58.117 --> 00:36:02.599
because the number of lines per
area will be some number of

00:36:02.599 --> 00:36:06.849
lines per charge divided by the
area of the sphere,

00:36:06.849 --> 00:36:10.199
which is 4Πr^(2).
 

00:36:10.199 --> 00:36:11.679
Do you follow that?
 

00:36:11.679 --> 00:36:14.025
If you take a sphere,
first of all,

00:36:14.025 --> 00:36:17.610
every portion of the sphere the
area that you have is

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:19.750
perpendicular to the lines.
 

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:22.449
So the area intercepts the
lines perpendicularly.

00:36:22.449 --> 00:36:24.150
That's the agreement here.
 

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:27.369
And you see how many are
crossing per unit area.

00:36:27.369 --> 00:36:31.820
That is going like 1 over
r^(2).

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:36.048
So these lines naturally
diverge and spread out in space

00:36:36.048 --> 00:36:39.431
so that the density falls
precisely as 1 over

00:36:39.431 --> 00:36:40.739
r^(2).
 

00:36:40.739 --> 00:36:44.427
That has to do also with the
fact you're living in three

00:36:44.427 --> 00:36:45.300
dimensions.
 

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.822
Only in three dimensions where
area goes like r^(2)^(

00:36:48.822 --> 00:36:52.228
)does this spreading of the
density of lines coincide with

00:36:52.228 --> 00:36:53.960
the decline of the force.
 

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.280
So these lines tell you more
than simply the direction.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.719
They convey to you visually
where the field is strong.

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:04.150
Wherever the lines are dense,
the field is strong.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:07.425
Wherever the lines are spread
apart, the field is weak,

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:09.610
and it's a very precise
statement.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:14.086
The only thing not precise is,
how many lines do you want to

00:37:14.086 --> 00:37:15.530
draw per coulomb.
 

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:18.099
That's really up to you,
but you've got to be

00:37:18.099 --> 00:37:18.860
consistent.
 

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.289
Once you give 32 lines per
coulomb, then if you've got a

00:37:21.289 --> 00:37:23.099
charge of 1 coulomb you should
draw 32.

00:37:23.099 --> 00:37:26.250
If you've got two coulombs,
you should draw 64 lines.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.552
As long as you do that,
the number of lines crossing

00:37:29.552 --> 00:37:32.789
per unit area will be
proportional to the field.

00:37:32.789 --> 00:37:36.547
But I'm going to make a certain
choice that will make the number

00:37:36.547 --> 00:37:39.469
of lines per unit area exactly
equal to the field,

00:37:39.469 --> 00:37:41.079
and here is the choice.
 

00:37:41.079 --> 00:37:43.219
It's a choice that makes life
simple.

00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:47.967
Let us agree that 1 coulomb
gets 1 over

00:37:47.967 --> 00:37:52.590
ε_0
lines.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.250
ε_0 is
a number, right?

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.800
1 over 4Πε
_0 is 9 times 10

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.469
to the 9^(th).
 

00:37:57.469 --> 00:37:58.690
This is some number.
 

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:02.773
Maybe 40 million,
so one coulomb gets 40 million

00:38:02.773 --> 00:38:03.469
lines.
 

00:38:03.469 --> 00:38:04.489
Don't quote the 40 million.
 

00:38:04.489 --> 00:38:05.869
It's whatever this thing is.
 

00:38:05.869 --> 00:38:07.030
I don't know what it is.
 

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.679
It's a definite number.
 

00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:11.420
Then, what's the nice thing?
 

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:16.753
If you've got q coulombs
you will have q over

00:38:16.753 --> 00:38:20.250
ε_0
lines,

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:24.353
and if you take a sphere of
radius r you'll get 1

00:38:24.353 --> 00:38:28.010
over 4Πr^(2)^( )as the
line density,

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:32.929
namely lines per unit area,
but that is exactly equal to

00:38:32.929 --> 00:38:36.239
the strength of the electric
field.

00:38:36.239 --> 00:38:37.936
If you picked a different
number like 2 over

00:38:37.936 --> 00:38:40.461
ε_0 you
will always be measuring 2 times

00:38:40.461 --> 00:38:41.369
the electric field.
 

00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:43.971
The density will still convey
the electric field,

00:38:43.971 --> 00:38:47.331
namely it'll be proportional to
it, but let's make life easy by

00:38:47.331 --> 00:38:48.739
making it equal to it.
 

00:38:48.739 --> 00:38:53.690
This is just a convenience.
 

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:54.590
Now, we are really set.
 

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:57.213
If you draw pictures this way,
you can go as far as you like

00:38:57.213 --> 00:38:58.059
from this charge.
 

00:38:58.059 --> 00:39:00.489
Simply take a unit area with
you.

00:39:00.489 --> 00:39:03.530
Take a piece of wood 1 meter by
1 meter, put it there,

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:07.858
see how many lines cross;
that is equal to the electric

00:39:07.858 --> 00:39:09.869
field at that point.
 

00:39:09.869 --> 00:39:15.530
Okay, so this is the way one
likes to visualize field lines.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.030
So I'm going to give you some
examples.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:21.610
For a single charge you just
draw it that way.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:26.405
For two charges,
let's take two charges,

00:39:26.405 --> 00:39:30.710
a minus charge and a plus
charge.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:35.349
Let's say that one is
-q, the other is

00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:36.510
q.
 

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:39.349
Then you are very near that
charge.

00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:41.077
By the way, I'm not going to
draw 1 over

00:39:41.077 --> 00:39:43.648
ε_0
lines per coulomb because it's

00:39:43.648 --> 00:39:45.289
going to be too many lines,
okay?

00:39:45.289 --> 00:39:47.099
I'm just going to draw a few so
you get the picture.

00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:54.380
So I'm going to draw four lines
right near the charge.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.929
You can forget about all other
charges in drawing the lines.

00:39:57.929 --> 00:40:03.929
Why is that?
 

00:40:03.929 --> 00:40:05.659
Yep?
 

00:40:05.659 --> 00:40:07.619
Student:  The field only
depends on the one charge.

00:40:07.619 --> 00:40:08.630
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.326
Student:  Why does the
field only depends on the one

00:40:10.326 --> 00:40:10.590
charge.
 

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.110
Prof: Why does it depend
on the one charge?

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:13.630
In principle it depends on
every charge.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:14.889
Somebody had an answer back
there?

00:40:14.889 --> 00:40:16.199
Yes?
 

00:40:16.199 --> 00:40:17.949
Student:  Since it falls
as 1 over r^(2)^( )when

00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:19.469
you're so much closer to one
than the other then...

00:40:19.469 --> 00:40:21.987
Prof: Right,
because the field is 1 over

00:40:21.987 --> 00:40:25.605
r^(2)^( )and the 1 over
r for this guy is going

00:40:25.605 --> 00:40:26.510
to infinity.
 

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.840
1 over r for this guy is
maybe 1 over 1 meter.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.949
It's finite.
 

00:40:29.949 --> 00:40:32.574
So when you come arbitrarily
close to a charge,

00:40:32.574 --> 00:40:34.059
it is going to dominate.
 

00:40:34.059 --> 00:40:36.579
Well, if it's the only thing in
the universe,

00:40:36.579 --> 00:40:38.869
we know the lines will look
like this.

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:41.306
At least they'll start out this
way, but soon,

00:40:41.306 --> 00:40:44.554
of course, it won't go out this
way forever, because you will

00:40:44.554 --> 00:40:46.449
realize there's another charge.
 

00:40:46.449 --> 00:40:52.039
Likewise, it's easy to draw the
lines this way.

00:40:52.039 --> 00:40:55.309
Remember, the lines are coming
in because if you put a test

00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:57.340
charge, it'll be sucked into
this.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.739
Test charge is always assumed
to be unit positive charge,

00:41:00.739 --> 00:41:02.530
so the lines will be coming
into a negative charge,

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:05.391
and leaving,
going away from a positive

00:41:05.391 --> 00:41:06.070
charge.
 

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:11.050
Now we've just go to do what
the agencies forgot to do,

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:13.909
which is to connect the dots.
 

00:41:13.909 --> 00:41:15.289
You do this.
 

00:41:15.289 --> 00:41:16.650
You do this.
 

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:17.860
You do this.
 

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:20.590
You do this.
 

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:24.909
Now, at some point you'll have
to think a little harder,

00:41:24.909 --> 00:41:27.110
because suppose I go here?
 

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:29.949
How do I know I should draw the
lines this way?

00:41:29.949 --> 00:41:33.889
If I take this guy here,
it will repel it.

00:41:33.889 --> 00:41:36.188
This guy will attract it,
and I add the two,

00:41:36.188 --> 00:41:39.077
and get a line in that
direction, so you really have to

00:41:39.077 --> 00:41:40.199
do a lot of work.
 

00:41:40.199 --> 00:41:42.300
If you really want this picture
to be exact,

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.880
you have to compute the vector
everywhere,

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.630
but if you want a sketch,
you're allowed to guess,

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:50.929
and things look like this.
 

00:41:50.929 --> 00:42:02.427
So this is called a dipole,
and this is the field of a

00:42:02.427 --> 00:42:04.380
dipole.
 

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.119
So here's another example.
 

00:42:06.119 --> 00:42:09.360
Both guys are plus.
 

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.789
Now what do the lines look like?
 

00:42:11.789 --> 00:42:26.159
Again, they will start out this
way near the charges,

00:42:26.159 --> 00:42:29.684
but now when you come to the
midpoint here there should be no

00:42:29.684 --> 00:42:32.974
electric field right in the
midpoint because it's getting

00:42:32.974 --> 00:42:35.030
pushed equally from both sides.
 

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:41.989
So the lines,
if you think about how they

00:42:41.989 --> 00:42:49.820
will add, they will do something
like this.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.626
Okay, look, I'm not going to do
a good job for a variety of

00:42:52.626 --> 00:42:54.632
reasons,
but you can look at your

00:42:54.632 --> 00:42:58.128
textbook or any other book to
see what the lines will look

00:42:58.128 --> 00:43:00.400
like when you've two plus
charges.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.742
If you go a mile away from
these two plus charges,

00:43:03.742 --> 00:43:06.880
what do you think the lines
would look like?

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:07.929
Yep?
 

00:43:07.929 --> 00:43:09.902
Student:  Just like a
point charge that's twice as

00:43:09.902 --> 00:43:10.219
strong.
 

00:43:10.219 --> 00:43:12.097
Prof: Right,
so that's the intuition you

00:43:12.097 --> 00:43:13.199
should keep in your mind.
 

00:43:13.199 --> 00:43:15.818
If you go very far from a
charge distribution where you

00:43:15.818 --> 00:43:18.795
cannot look into the details,
all you will see is some little

00:43:18.795 --> 00:43:20.590
dot that has the entire charge
in it,

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.518
and the lines will be coming
out radially.

00:43:22.518 --> 00:43:25.360
So only when you zoom in you
realize, hey,

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.965
it's not a single charge
2q, it is two guys of

00:43:28.965 --> 00:43:30.489
strength q.
 

00:43:30.489 --> 00:43:35.329
Finally, let's take a case
where this is charge 2q.

00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:36.969
This is charge q.
 

00:43:36.969 --> 00:43:41.969
Let's say this is charge
-q.

00:43:41.969 --> 00:43:54.998
Then some lines will go like
this and some lines will run off

00:43:54.998 --> 00:43:58.039
to infinity.
 

00:43:58.039 --> 00:44:00.813
Here if you go very,
very far away from the two

00:44:00.813 --> 00:44:03.949
charges you'll again see
radially outgoing lines,

00:44:03.949 --> 00:44:10.596
except there is a charge
q at the center because

00:44:10.596 --> 00:44:17.119
2q and -q give you
a net of q.

00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:18.429
Okay?
 

00:44:18.429 --> 00:44:21.768
So this is the example of a
dipole.

00:44:21.768 --> 00:44:24.724
If you've got more charges it
gets more complicated,

00:44:24.724 --> 00:44:26.809
so people don't usually draw
them.

00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:29.869
There's one example which is
pretty interesting.

00:44:29.869 --> 00:44:35.400
If you've got one plate and
another plate,

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.699
this contains all positive
charges,

00:44:37.699 --> 00:44:40.719
this contains all negative
charges,

00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:47.929
then the field here will look
like this,

00:44:47.929 --> 00:44:49.559
will go from the positive to
the negative plate,

00:44:49.559 --> 00:44:51.739
because if you put a test
charge between them,

00:44:51.739 --> 00:44:54.215
it's getting repelled by the
positive plate and attracted by

00:44:54.215 --> 00:44:57.655
the negative plate,
so the lines will go from one

00:44:57.655 --> 00:44:58.869
to the other.
 

00:44:58.869 --> 00:45:01.862
Near the edges they may do
something more complicated,

00:45:01.862 --> 00:45:04.289
but in the bulk they will look
like this.

00:45:04.289 --> 00:45:15.710
 
 

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:19.967
Okay, so now I'm going to do
one calculation,

00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:25.969
which is: what is the actual
electric field due to a dipole?

00:45:25.969 --> 00:45:28.070
In other words,
not just the picture here,

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:28.889
where is that?
 

00:45:28.889 --> 00:45:30.789
That picture on the left is a
dipole.

00:45:30.789 --> 00:45:33.969
I'm going to do it
quantitatively.

00:45:33.969 --> 00:45:38.637
So here's my goal:
I want to take a minus charge

00:45:38.637 --> 00:45:41.320
here, a plus charge here.
 

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.519
This is at x = a.
 

00:45:43.519 --> 00:45:50.159
This is at x = -a.
 

00:45:50.159 --> 00:45:51.719
So I want to find the field
everywhere.

00:45:51.719 --> 00:45:53.650
So today I'm not going to do
the field everywhere,

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:56.576
because later on I'll show you
a more effective way to

00:45:56.576 --> 00:45:59.724
calculate it,
but I'm going to calculate it

00:45:59.724 --> 00:46:02.849
at a couple of interesting easy
places.

00:46:02.849 --> 00:46:06.911
In other words,
we all know the lines look like

00:46:06.911 --> 00:46:08.059
this, okay?
 

00:46:08.059 --> 00:46:11.661
But I want to go to some
location and find the magnitude

00:46:11.661 --> 00:46:13.559
and direction of the field.
 

00:46:13.559 --> 00:46:16.429
But today I will only find it
at two places,

00:46:16.429 --> 00:46:19.960
one along the axis at a point
x,

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:26.987
and one on the perpendicular
bisector at a point (x =

00:46:26.987 --> 00:46:32.110
0, y),
just going to do those two.

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:38.190
So let's see what's the field
here, the field at this point?

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:42.184
The field at that point,
you agree, is going to be

00:46:42.184 --> 00:46:46.588
entirely in the x direction
because this is pushing it,

00:46:46.588 --> 00:46:48.789
and that is pulling it.
 

00:46:48.789 --> 00:46:52.965
So E is going to be
i (unit vector) times

00:46:52.965 --> 00:46:56.358
q over
4Πε

00:46:56.358 --> 00:47:00.849
_0 times that
distance squared,

00:47:00.849 --> 00:47:08.139
which happens to be (x -
a)^(2).

00:47:08.139 --> 00:47:12.929
That's the repulsion due to the
charge that's nearer to you.

00:47:12.929 --> 00:47:14.639
Then there's the attraction due
to the minus q,

00:47:14.639 --> 00:47:21.043
but it's a little further away,
so it looks like a minus sign

00:47:21.043 --> 00:47:24.139
but it is (x a)^(2).
 

00:47:24.139 --> 00:47:27.920
If a is equal to 0 you
get 0.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.237
If a is equal to 0 the
two guys are sitting exactly on

00:47:30.237 --> 00:47:31.010
top of each other.
 

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:32.920
You will not see them.
 

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.759
So you see them only because
they're not on top of each

00:47:35.759 --> 00:47:36.179
other.
 

00:47:36.179 --> 00:47:40.503
This whole thing fails to be 0
because this a is not 0,

00:47:40.503 --> 00:47:42.559
and you can understand why.
 

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:46.032
The minute a is not 0
you're closer to one of the two

00:47:46.032 --> 00:47:49.329
charges, so that they cannot
really cancel each other.

00:47:49.329 --> 00:47:52.159
So you've got to manipulate
this expression,

00:47:52.159 --> 00:47:53.739
so I will do that now.
 

00:47:53.739 --> 00:47:55.884
q over
4Πε

00:47:55.884 --> 00:47:58.840
_0 and you find
common denominator.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.481
I remind you (x
a) times (x -

00:48:02.481 --> 00:48:06.867
a) is (x^(2 )-
a^(2))^( )and everything

00:48:06.867 --> 00:48:08.429
is under squares.
 

00:48:08.429 --> 00:48:15.105
In the numerator you've got
(x a)^(2) -

00:48:15.105 --> 00:48:18.699
(x - a)^(2).
 

00:48:18.699 --> 00:48:20.059
So what does that give me?
 

00:48:20.059 --> 00:48:24.150
iq over
4Πε

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.059
_0,
(x^(2 )-

00:48:27.059 --> 00:48:29.059
a^(2))^(2).
 

00:48:29.059 --> 00:48:33.460
And how about on the top,
can you do that in your head?

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:36.601
This is going to be
x^(2) a^(2)

00:48:36.601 --> 00:48:37.530
2xa.
 

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:43.255
You're going to subtract from
it x^(2) a^(2) -

00:48:43.255 --> 00:48:48.594
2xa, and the only thing
that will survive will be

00:48:48.594 --> 00:48:50.050
4xa.
 

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:52.030
Is everything okay?
 

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:58.480
Student:  Why is it not
x - a squared times x a squared?

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.239
Prof: It is.
 

00:49:00.239 --> 00:49:05.028
You are saying why is it not
(x a)^(2) times

00:49:05.028 --> 00:49:07.969
(x - a)^(2),
right?

00:49:07.969 --> 00:49:13.858
It is, because this would be
x a times x

00:49:13.858 --> 00:49:17.590
- a, the whole thing
squared.

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:18.159
Student:  Oh!
 

00:49:18.159 --> 00:49:22.099
Prof: And this guy is
x^(2 )- a^(2).

00:49:22.099 --> 00:49:27.420
So this is classified as a nice
try, so.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.110
But I want you to keep doing
this.

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:31.510
This time I am right,
but you never know,

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.929
okay?
 

00:49:31.929 --> 00:49:33.840
I don't want you to give up.
 

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.929
There is nothing better than
shooting me down,

00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:37.510
but this happened to be
correct.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:39.170
You satisfied though?
 

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:40.911
Student:  I knew you
were right, I just couldn't

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:41.460
figure out why.
 

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:42.010
Prof: No, no, no, no.
 

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:43.630
I don't want to rush through
this.

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:47.199
Anybody have the same problem
with this?

00:49:47.199 --> 00:49:50.956
Look, also I am doing it fast
because this is 958th time I'm

00:49:50.956 --> 00:49:54.329
doing this calculation,
so if you're seeing it for the

00:49:54.329 --> 00:49:56.750
first time, I've got to slow
down.

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:58.309
So let's see which part.
 

00:49:58.309 --> 00:50:01.610
Everybody okay with this, right?
 

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:04.710
So I wrote that.
 

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:07.197
Then this is really an x
a times another x

00:50:07.197 --> 00:50:09.065
a,
and an x - a and

00:50:09.065 --> 00:50:11.601
another x - a,
but without these guys,

00:50:11.601 --> 00:50:14.356
I know it's x^(2 )-
a^(2 )because I've got

00:50:14.356 --> 00:50:15.409
two of everything.
 

00:50:15.409 --> 00:50:16.969
I squared everything.
 

00:50:16.969 --> 00:50:21.195
So this answer's actually an
exact formula of the electric

00:50:21.195 --> 00:50:23.940
field along the axis of the
dipole.

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:27.295
But normally what one is
interested in is,

00:50:27.295 --> 00:50:30.980
when x is much bigger
than a.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:34.204
When it's much bigger than
a, downstairs you've got

00:50:34.204 --> 00:50:35.280
x squared.
 

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.193
This could be 1 kilometer
squared, a squared was

00:50:38.193 --> 00:50:39.760
maybe 1 millimeter squared.
 

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.724
So in the first approximation,
it's not an exact formula

00:50:42.724 --> 00:50:45.474
anymore, from now on it is
approximate, in the limit

00:50:45.474 --> 00:50:47.739
x is much bigger than
a.

00:50:47.739 --> 00:50:52.822
You can see it's going to be
i times q over

00:50:52.822 --> 00:50:59.282
2Πε
_0 times

00:50:59.282 --> 00:51:04.480
2a divided by
x^(3).

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.769
So what did I do now?
 

00:51:06.769 --> 00:51:09.289
I took from the 4a.
 

00:51:09.289 --> 00:51:13.137
I borrowed a 2a to write
this here and I canceled the 2

00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:15.030
with the 4 here to get that.
 

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.264
Then on the top I had an
x, and the bottom had

00:51:17.264 --> 00:51:17.909
x^(4).
 

00:51:17.909 --> 00:51:22.650
I get x^(3).
 

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:27.034
So let me write--can everybody
see this thing from wherever you

00:51:27.034 --> 00:51:31.070
are;
the last formula here?

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:35.346
So I'm going to write it as
i times p divided

00:51:35.346 --> 00:51:39.768
by 2Πε
_0 x^(3).

00:51:39.768 --> 00:51:48.539
So I will tell you what I'm
doing.

00:51:48.539 --> 00:51:53.322
So the final formula I had was
electric field E = i

00:51:53.322 --> 00:51:57.548
times p divided by
2Πε

00:51:57.548 --> 00:52:01.579
_0x^(3),
where p--I'm sorry,

00:52:01.579 --> 00:52:04.380
i times p,
no arrow;

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:08.670
p is equal to 2aq.
 

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:12.050
So let's delete some extra
arrows I had.

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:13.268
That's right.
 

00:52:13.268 --> 00:52:16.780
You never should settle for
something that looks like that.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:18.260
So that's p.
 

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:23.300
So p is called the
dipole moment of this dipole,

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:27.159
and it's given by the product
of the distance between the

00:52:27.159 --> 00:52:30.400
charges and the value of one of
the charges,

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.559
the plus charge.
 

00:52:31.559 --> 00:52:36.846
So whenever I give you two
charges, call it dipole,

00:52:36.846 --> 00:52:40.969
you can associate with them a
vector.

00:52:40.969 --> 00:52:43.820
And the vector is,
if you've got a charge

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:47.809
-q here and a charge
q there separated by a

00:52:47.809 --> 00:52:52.297
little vector r, then the
dipole moment is q times

00:52:52.297 --> 00:52:54.650
the little vector r.
 

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:58.228
In our example the little
vector r was 2a in

00:52:58.228 --> 00:52:59.360
the x direction.
 

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.576
So 2a times i
times q is the dipole

00:53:04.576 --> 00:53:05.429
moment.
 

00:53:05.429 --> 00:53:10.112
So this means electric field is
parallel to the dipole moment

00:53:10.112 --> 00:53:13.000
and falls like 1 over
x^(3).

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.539
That's the most important part
of the dipole.

00:53:16.539 --> 00:53:18.737
A single charge,
the field falls like 1 over

00:53:18.737 --> 00:53:21.139
x^(2) if you move a
distance x.

00:53:21.139 --> 00:53:24.755
A dipole will always fall like
a bigger power of x,

00:53:24.755 --> 00:53:28.307
because to go like 1 over
x^(2) you've got to have

00:53:28.307 --> 00:53:29.260
net charge.
 

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:32.512
As long as the net charge is 0
the fact that there are two

00:53:32.512 --> 00:53:35.650
opposite charges that don't
quite cancel each other,

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:38.920
it always comes from the fact
that the distance between them

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.530
is not 0.
 

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:41.960
And the distance will appear in
the numerator,

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:43.690
and that must be the
corresponding distance in the

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:45.643
denominator,
because the formula should have

00:53:45.643 --> 00:53:46.610
the same dimensions.
 

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:49.762
That's what turns the 1 over
x^(2) to 1 over

00:53:49.762 --> 00:53:50.710
x^(3).
 

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:51.610
Yep?
 

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:54.300
Student:  That only
works if x is a lot

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.489
bigger than a.
 

00:53:55.489 --> 00:53:56.539
Prof: Yes.
 

00:53:56.539 --> 00:53:59.199
So this formula is good for all
x;

00:53:59.199 --> 00:54:01.650
this formula is good only for
x bigger than a.

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:04.277
You'll find whenever you're
working with dipoles,

00:54:04.277 --> 00:54:07.617
people will always ask you to
find the field very far from the

00:54:07.617 --> 00:54:08.219
dipole.
 

00:54:08.219 --> 00:54:13.219
So here's a second place where
I can go and find the field.

00:54:13.219 --> 00:54:18.561
That's going to be here,
-a, a,

00:54:18.561 --> 00:54:23.420
and I'm going to find the field
there.

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.400
So that's at a distance
y.

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.389
So let's look at this.
 

00:54:27.389 --> 00:54:30.960
That's a q here and
-q here.

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.039
A q will repel it that
way, and a -q will

00:54:34.039 --> 00:54:36.889
attract it this way,
and their sum will be that.

00:54:36.889 --> 00:54:43.420
I'm going to compute that sum.
 

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:45.369
So how do I do this?
 

00:54:45.369 --> 00:54:48.110
Let's look at this guy here.
 

00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:52.862
We know that these arrows have
equal magnitude because this

00:54:52.862 --> 00:54:56.139
distance is the same as that
distance.

00:54:56.139 --> 00:54:59.619
Therefore, it's the horizontal
part that will remain.

00:54:59.619 --> 00:55:04.130
The vertical part will cancel.
 

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.710
You see that?
 

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:07.963
We've got two arrows of the
same length with this angle and

00:55:07.963 --> 00:55:09.030
this angle equal.
 

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:11.534
The horizontal part will be
additive and the vertical part

00:55:11.534 --> 00:55:12.809
will be equal and opposite.
 

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:16.449
So I'm only going to compute
the horizontal part.

00:55:16.449 --> 00:55:22.289
So the electric field now will
be -

00:55:22.289 --> 00:55:25.873
i (that's to tell me
it's in the negative x

00:55:25.873 --> 00:55:29.822
direction) times q over
4Πε

00:55:29.822 --> 00:55:33.771
_0 times 1 over
distance squared which is

00:55:33.771 --> 00:55:36.550
(y^(2)^( ) a^(2)).
 

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:39.070
This is (y^(2)^( )
a^(2)).

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:41.139
That's also (y^(2)^( )
a^(2)),

00:55:41.139 --> 00:55:43.170
but I want the horizontal part
of this,

00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:45.179
so I want the cosine
θ.

00:55:45.179 --> 00:55:47.710
That is the same as this one.
 

00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:53.226
The cosine θ is
a divided by

00:55:53.226 --> 00:55:58.510
(y^(2)^( )
a^(2))^(½).

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:01.434
See, you want to take that
force and find this horizontal

00:56:01.434 --> 00:56:01.800
part.
 

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:06.170
Then I'm going to put on
another 2 because this is going

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:09.429
to contribute an equal
horizontal part.

00:56:09.429 --> 00:56:14.927
So the E,
in the end, is equal to

00:56:14.927 --> 00:56:22.681
-iq2a over
4Πε

00:56:22.681 --> 00:56:28.884
_0 divided by
(y^(2)^( )

00:56:28.884 --> 00:56:32.550
a^(2))^(3/2).
 

00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:37.001
That is then -p divided
by 4Πε

00:56:37.001 --> 00:56:40.440
_0 divided by
y^(3),

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.309
for y much bigger than
a.

00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:48.990
I'm sorry, y^(3),
y is really the

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:50.349
distance.
 

00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:54.175
So, right, if y is 1
mile and a is 1

00:56:54.175 --> 00:56:57.690
millimeter that's essentially
the distance.

00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:01.523
If you like you can call it
-p divided by

00:57:01.523 --> 00:57:06.090
4Πε
_0r^(3).

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:10.164
Where r is the distance,
if you like,

00:57:10.164 --> 00:57:12.820
from the center of dipole.
 

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:15.018
Look, the point of this
exercise is twofold.

00:57:15.018 --> 00:57:19.954
One is to show you how to add
vectorially the fields due to

00:57:19.954 --> 00:57:20.889
two guys.
 

00:57:20.889 --> 00:57:22.639
Another is, to have you
understand,

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:25.655
at least, how to do the
computation at a few simple

00:57:25.655 --> 00:57:27.652
places,
where the direction of the

00:57:27.652 --> 00:57:29.530
field is not so hard to
calculate.

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:32.074
Actually, one would like to
compute it here,

00:57:32.074 --> 00:57:33.789
but it becomes quite nasty.
 

00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:36.411
The magnitude is not so hard,
but the direction is hard to

00:57:36.411 --> 00:57:38.159
calculate, so we'll find a
shortcut.

00:57:38.159 --> 00:57:41.440
But at these two places,
on the perpendicular bisector

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.978
and on the axis,
the mathematics is pretty

00:57:43.978 --> 00:57:44.659
simple.
 

00:57:44.659 --> 00:57:45.630
That's the electric field.
 

00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:46.400
Yeah?
 

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.063
Student:  Is p as
a vector different from the

00:57:48.063 --> 00:57:49.639
p that you crossed out as
a vector over there?

00:57:49.639 --> 00:57:50.503
Prof: No.
 

00:57:50.503 --> 00:57:51.800
It's the same p.
 

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:56.490
So p as a vector in our
example will be the charge at

00:57:56.490 --> 00:58:00.070
either end times the distance
between them.

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:04.219
The vector difference is
2a times i.

00:58:04.219 --> 00:58:17.000
So you can write the formula in
terms of the dipole moment.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:28.186
Okay, so now I'm going to do
the second part of the problem,

00:58:28.186 --> 00:58:36.530
which is finding the response
to E.

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:39.280
This was all computing E.
 

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.731
Of course there are more and
more complicated examples,

00:58:41.731 --> 00:58:43.139
but we did a few simple ones.
 

00:58:43.139 --> 00:58:45.512
Next is going to be,
if I give you E, can you

00:58:45.512 --> 00:58:47.280
find what will happen to the
charge.

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:49.579
So I'm going to do two examples.
 

00:58:49.579 --> 00:58:53.340
One is there are these two
plates I mentioned to you.

00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:54.929
This one is all positively
charged.

00:58:54.929 --> 00:58:58.510
This one is negatively charged.
 

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:01.914
And I shoot a particle here,
with some velocity

00:59:01.914 --> 00:59:05.320
v�_o in the x
direction,

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:10.670
and the field everywhere is
down, and the electric field is

00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:17.407
some constant,
-j times some number

00:59:17.407 --> 00:59:21.619
E_0.
 

00:59:21.619 --> 00:59:28.525
-j because i is
this way and j is that

00:59:28.525 --> 00:59:29.239
way.
 

00:59:29.239 --> 00:59:31.974
So what will this do is the
question, and where will it end

00:59:31.974 --> 00:59:32.210
up?
 

00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:35.918
Well, I think you can all tell
that it'll end up somewhere

00:59:35.918 --> 00:59:36.440
there.
 

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:41.469
What we're trying to find out
is how much does it fall,

00:59:41.469 --> 00:59:46.128
and when it comes out,
what's the direction of this

00:59:46.128 --> 00:59:48.550
final velocity vector.
 

00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:54.800
Well, the force on this charge
is equal to -q times

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.309
E_0 j.
 

00:59:58.309 --> 01:00:04.237
The acceleration will be
-qE_0 over

01:00:04.237 --> 01:00:09.469
m times j in the y
direction.

01:00:09.469 --> 01:00:11.829
So what'll be the position?
 

01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:27.929
Position will be from lecture
number one of your Physics 200.

01:00:27.929 --> 01:00:33.547
So let's say the starting point
r_0 is our

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:34.420
origin.
 

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:38.853
v_0 is
whatever it was projected in

01:00:38.853 --> 01:00:42.503
with,
plus ½

01:00:42.503 --> 01:00:51.818
times qE_0
over m,

01:00:51.818 --> 01:00:57.500
t^(2) j.
 

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:01.117
Okay, so as a function of time
this tells you where the

01:01:01.117 --> 01:01:02.389
position will be.
 

01:01:02.389 --> 01:01:04.929
At t = 0,
you are at the origin.

01:01:04.929 --> 01:01:09.137
As t increases,
it's moving horizontally due to

01:01:09.137 --> 01:01:13.902
v_0 and it's
also dropping vertically due to

01:01:13.902 --> 01:01:15.570
the acceleration.
 

01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:18.139
Then it's very easy from now on
to compute anything you like.

01:01:18.139 --> 01:01:20.875
For example,
when you want to go to that

01:01:20.875 --> 01:01:23.050
point, what will be the time?
 

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:34.099
Anybody tell me what the time
will be when I go to that point?

01:01:34.099 --> 01:01:38.570
How long will it be in the
region between the plates?

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.340
Yep?
 

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:43.224
Student:  The distance
of the length of the plate

01:01:43.224 --> 01:01:44.800
divided by initial velocity.
 

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.289
Prof: Which velocity
should we take?

01:01:47.289 --> 01:01:48.800
Student:  The initial
horizontal velocity.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.318
Prof: That's correct
because t will be

01:01:51.318 --> 01:01:53.246
L over v_0
where

01:01:53.246 --> 01:01:56.210
v_0�'s
the magnitude of the initial

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:58.780
velocity because x velocity is
never changing.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:00.659
Acceleration is in the y
direction.

01:02:00.659 --> 01:02:03.596
So the time it takes to cross
will be independent of the fact

01:02:03.596 --> 01:02:05.260
it's falling in the y direction.
 

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:09.835
So if you put t equal to
all of this you will find out

01:02:09.835 --> 01:02:11.590
where it will end up.
 

01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:14.570
And that's how you make
pictures on the television.

01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:18.389
You've got a bunch of plates,
and then you drive charges,

01:02:18.389 --> 01:02:22.079
and if you apply the right
electric field the electron will

01:02:22.079 --> 01:02:24.690
land on a screen and make a
little dot.

01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:27.728
The screen will look like this,
and you're looking at it from

01:02:27.728 --> 01:02:28.590
the other side.
 

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:29.849
It'll glow.
 

01:02:29.849 --> 01:02:33.159
Then you want the dot to move
up and down, you can move the

01:02:33.159 --> 01:02:33.730
voltage.
 

01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:36.478
Then if you want to move it
back and forth you've got to put

01:02:36.478 --> 01:02:38.155
another set of plates,
not like this,

01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:39.880
but coming out of the
blackboard.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:43.018
That way you can move the
electron beam in all directions.

01:02:43.018 --> 01:02:47.260
That's how you scan the
television screen.

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:51.606
You can also use magnetic
fields, but this is one simple

01:02:51.606 --> 01:02:53.739
way using electric field.
 

01:02:53.739 --> 01:03:07.099
All right, final thing to
discuss is: what is the force of

01:03:07.099 --> 01:03:16.239
a uniform electric field on a
dipole?

01:03:16.239 --> 01:03:23.969
So let's take an electric field
in the x direction like that.

01:03:23.969 --> 01:03:28.894
It's got a magnitude
E_0 and it's in

01:03:28.894 --> 01:03:30.599
the x direction.
 

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:36.840
And in this electric field I
stick a dipole in like that.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.059
Here is the q.
 

01:03:38.059 --> 01:03:41.309
Here is the -q.
 

01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:43.460
Let's make that a.
 

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:46.760
Let's make that a.
 

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:50.130
So the plus charge will
experience a force like that.

01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:52.550
The minus charge will
experience a force like that.

01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:54.780
This will be q times
E_0.

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.929
That'll be -q times
E_0.

01:03:57.929 --> 01:04:00.748
So dipole as a whole will not
feel any net force,

01:04:00.748 --> 01:04:03.744
because the two parts are
getting pulled by opposite

01:04:03.744 --> 01:04:04.389
amount.
 

01:04:04.389 --> 01:04:06.659
If the electric field were not
uniform,

01:04:06.659 --> 01:04:09.210
namely if it were stronger here
than here,

01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:10.518
then of course it will drift to
the right,

01:04:10.518 --> 01:04:12.369
but I'm taking uniform electric
field,

01:04:12.369 --> 01:04:14.280
and because the charges are
equal and opposite,

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.110
the net force on it is 0.
 

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:22.039
But something is not 0.
 

01:04:22.039 --> 01:04:24.510
You know what something is
that's not 0?

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:25.340
Yep?
 

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:26.039
Student:  The torque.
 

01:04:26.039 --> 01:04:27.550
Prof: The torque.
 

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:30.664
There is a torque because there
is a force here and the force

01:04:30.664 --> 01:04:31.079
there.
 

01:04:31.079 --> 01:04:35.621
You can imagine they're trying
to straighten out the dipole so

01:04:35.621 --> 01:04:37.929
it ends up looking like this.
 

01:04:37.929 --> 01:04:40.809
So let's find the magnitude of
that torque.

01:04:40.809 --> 01:04:46.001
Magnitude of the torque is the
force times the perpendicular

01:04:46.001 --> 01:04:46.969
distance.
 

01:04:46.969 --> 01:04:49.737
So if this angle is
θ here,

01:04:49.737 --> 01:04:52.931
and you want the perpendicular
distance, it is

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:55.059
asinθ.
 

01:04:55.059 --> 01:04:57.396
Then there's another
asinθ from

01:04:57.396 --> 01:04:57.909
that one.
 

01:04:57.909 --> 01:05:02.380
That's the torque.
 

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:10.141
But since 2q a is
p, it's pE_0

01:05:10.141 --> 01:05:13.099
sinθ.
 

01:05:13.099 --> 01:05:14.369
You can see this makes sense.
 

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:18.125
If θ was 0,
if the dipole was aligned with

01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:19.932
the field,
the torque vanishes,

01:05:19.932 --> 01:05:22.597
because if the charges are like
this there is no tendency to

01:05:22.597 --> 01:05:23.050
rotate.
 

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:26.402
The biggest torque you get,
if the charges are like this,

01:05:26.402 --> 01:05:28.440
then this gets rotated that
way.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.599
That gets rotated that way.
 

01:05:29.599 --> 01:05:31.679
You get the maximum torque.
 

01:05:31.679 --> 01:05:33.806
Put θ equal to
Π by 2,

01:05:33.806 --> 01:05:36.610
you get a torque of p
times E_0.

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:39.349
That's also the reason it's
called a dipole moment.

01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:44.280
Now, I'm going to write this as
a cross product,

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:50.679
and I'm assuming you guys are
familiar with the cross product,

01:05:50.679 --> 01:05:51.730
right?
 

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:54.820
You take two vectors,
p and E,

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:57.041
the cross product has a
magnitude, which is p

01:05:57.041 --> 01:05:59.440
times E times sine of the
angle between them,

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:04.027
and a direction obtained by
turning a screwdriver from

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:06.019
p to E.
 

01:06:06.019 --> 01:06:07.960
So p is like this.
 

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.610
E is like this.
 

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:11.329
Turn a screwdriver from
p to E,

01:06:11.329 --> 01:06:15.550
it goes into the board,
and that's the torque,

01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:18.440
and the dipole will then rotate
until it lines up,

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:22.255
or if you don't want it to
rotate you've got to provide a

01:06:22.255 --> 01:06:24.639
counter-torque of this
magnitude.

01:06:24.639 --> 01:06:28.179
Now, if you take any dipole and
leave it,

01:06:28.179 --> 01:06:32.360
you know it will like to become
horizontal,

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.157
so there is a certain restoring
torque that tries to rotate it

01:06:36.157 --> 01:06:39.487
so it becomes horizontal,
and it's not very different

01:06:39.487 --> 01:06:41.487
from a spring,
where if you pull it from

01:06:41.487 --> 01:06:43.840
equilibrium,
there is a restoring force that

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.829
brings you back to where you
were.

01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:48.570
So this dipole is happiest when
it's horizontal.

01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:53.090
If you go away from horizontal
the torque brings it back.

01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:56.925
So just like for a spring,
if you've got a force which is

01:06:56.925 --> 01:07:00.760
-kx we can assign a
potential energy U,

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:05.119
which is ½
kx^(2) so that the force

01:07:05.119 --> 01:07:08.300
is equal to
-dU/dx.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.840
This is something I am assuming
you guys know;

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.460
the relation between potential
and force.

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.880
Relation between potential and
force,

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.724
the potential at
x_1 minus the

01:07:18.724 --> 01:07:21.137
potential at
x_2 is the

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:24.168
integral of the force from
x_1 to

01:07:24.168 --> 01:07:25.840
x_2.
 

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:29.409
This is how potential is
defined.

01:07:29.409 --> 01:07:32.599
This is the reason why,
if you knew the potential minus

01:07:32.599 --> 01:07:36.869
the derivative gives the force,
and if you knew the force,

01:07:36.869 --> 01:07:41.389
its integral will give you the
change in potential.

01:07:41.389 --> 01:07:44.909
All right, so now when you do
rotations,

01:07:44.909 --> 01:07:48.920
whatever you had for force you
had for torque,

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:53.659
and whatever played the role of
x is played by

01:07:53.659 --> 01:07:55.210
θ.
 

01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:57.797
In other words,
in rotational dynamics torque

01:07:57.797 --> 01:08:00.739
is to force--just like one of
the SAT questions.

01:08:00.739 --> 01:08:04.344
Torque is to force as
θ is to x,

01:08:04.344 --> 01:08:06.039
and work is just work.
 

01:08:06.039 --> 01:08:10.949
If you want to calculate the
work done by the dipole,

01:08:10.949 --> 01:08:15.744
but if you like the potential
energy when it's at an angle

01:08:15.744 --> 01:08:20.962
θ and its potential
energy when it's at angle 0 is

01:08:20.962 --> 01:08:25.252
the integral of the torque
dθ from 0 to

01:08:25.252 --> 01:08:27.020
θ.
 

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.460
Now, what is the torque?
 

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:34.291
The torque is
-pEsinθ

01:08:34.291 --> 01:08:40.328
dθ from 0 to
θ.

01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:44.176
There's a minus sign because if
θ tries to

01:08:44.176 --> 01:08:47.310
increase, the torque tries to
decrease it.

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:50.930
That's why it has got a minus
sign.

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:53.182
Now, integral of minus
sinθ is

01:08:53.182 --> 01:08:55.648
cosθ,
so you will get

01:08:55.648 --> 01:09:00.201
pEcosθ -
pEcos 0 which is

01:09:00.201 --> 01:09:03.643
-pE,
and that is supposed to equal

01:09:03.643 --> 01:09:07.270
to U(θ) -
U(0).

01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:12.841
By comparing the two
expressions you can identify

01:09:12.841 --> 01:09:17.899
U(θ) to be--
sorry, this is

01:09:17.899 --> 01:09:22.020
U(0) minus
U(θ),

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:25.567
therefore
U(θ) is

01:09:25.567 --> 01:09:29.510
equal to
-pEcosθ,

01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:37.430
or just -p dot E.
 

01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:43.194
So that's the final formula you
have to remember,

01:09:43.194 --> 01:09:47.760
that the--can we bring it down
here?

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:51.210
When you have a dipole in an
electric field,

01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:54.925
it has a potential energy
associated with the angle which

01:09:54.925 --> 01:10:00.002
is -p dot E,
and if you draw a picture of

01:10:00.002 --> 01:10:05.408
that as a function of
θ it goes like

01:10:05.408 --> 01:10:06.310
this.
 

01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:10.078
θ = 0 is when the
dipole is parallel to the field.

01:10:10.078 --> 01:10:15.159
That's when it has the minimum
energy, -pE.

01:10:15.159 --> 01:10:17.869
At 90 degrees, energy is 0.
 

01:10:17.869 --> 01:10:22.010
At 180 degrees, it's maximum.
 

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:25.789
And the torque is just
-dU/dθ and

01:10:25.789 --> 01:10:29.788
you can see that the torque here
and there are zero,

01:10:29.788 --> 01:10:32.100
but this is the point of stable
equilibrium.

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.680
That's the point of unstable
equilibrium.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.877
See, if this was a potential
energy like a shape of the

01:10:37.877 --> 01:10:40.006
ground,
if you left a marble there

01:10:40.006 --> 01:10:42.585
it'll stay there,
but if it moved a little bit,

01:10:42.585 --> 01:10:43.840
it would roll down hill.
 

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.626
But if you left the marble here
it'll stay there,

01:10:46.626 --> 01:10:49.529
but if you move it,
it'll rattle back and forth.

01:10:49.529 --> 01:10:51.000
That's a stable equilibrium.
 

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.100
That's unstable.
 

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:55.760
So for the dipole when it's
parallel to the field you are

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:59.420
here, and at anti-parallel to
the field you are there.

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.328
The difference is when you're
parallel and you move it a

01:11:02.328 --> 01:11:05.354
little bit,
it'll have stable oscillations,

01:11:05.354 --> 01:11:09.779
whereas if at anti-parallel if
you move it a little bit it'll

01:11:09.779 --> 01:11:12.948
flip over completely and come
down here.

01:11:12.948 --> 01:11:18.381
All right, so I'm going to
summarize the main points so you

01:11:18.381 --> 01:11:21.380
can carry that with you,
okay?

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:24.756
We saw today that we should
think in terms of electric field

01:11:24.756 --> 01:11:28.074
from now on, and we no longer
talk about direct interaction

01:11:28.074 --> 01:11:29.220
between charges.
 

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:33.661
We say charges produce fields,
and fields act on charges to

01:11:33.661 --> 01:11:34.578
move them.
 

01:11:34.578 --> 01:11:37.462
The force of a field on a
charge is just q times

01:11:37.462 --> 01:11:38.050
E.
 

01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:41.485
The field is found by adding
the field due to all the charges

01:11:41.485 --> 01:11:44.063
in the universe,
provided they're all at rest,

01:11:44.063 --> 01:11:46.238
and you just add by Coulomb's
Law.

01:11:46.238 --> 01:11:49.685
So we found the field due to a
dipole allowing the axis and

01:11:49.685 --> 01:11:51.350
perpendicular to the axis.
 

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:54.162
We saw the notion of field
lines as a good way to visualize

01:11:54.162 --> 01:11:56.538
what's going on in the vicinity
of the charges.

01:11:56.538 --> 01:11:59.470
The lines tell you the
direction where the field is,

01:11:59.470 --> 01:12:01.439
and they tell you in your line
density,

01:12:01.439 --> 01:12:04.109
lines cutting a unit area
perpendicular to them,

01:12:04.109 --> 01:12:05.868
the strength of the field.
 

01:12:05.868 --> 01:12:09.746
Then I calculated for you the
field of a dipole along the axis

01:12:09.746 --> 01:12:11.779
and perpendicular to the axis.
 

01:12:11.779 --> 01:12:14.314
There are a lot of formulas,
but one thing you should carry

01:12:14.314 --> 01:12:14.970
in your head.
 

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:18.849
When you've got two equal and
opposite charges and you go very

01:12:18.849 --> 01:12:22.029
far, the field will go like 1
over r^(3).

01:12:22.029 --> 01:12:25.537
The 1 over r^(2) part of
them is canceled,

01:12:25.537 --> 01:12:26.050
okay?
 

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:28.345
That's the main point,
and it goes like 1 over

01:12:28.345 --> 01:12:31.253
r^(3) times 2 in one
place, and 1 over r^(3)

01:12:31.253 --> 01:12:32.529
times 1 in one place.
 

01:12:32.529 --> 01:12:33.488
It doesn't matter.
 

01:12:33.488 --> 01:12:35.939
The main thing is it's 1 over
r^(3).

01:12:35.939 --> 01:12:39.359
Finally, if you take a dipole
and you put it in an electric

01:12:39.359 --> 01:12:41.409
field,
it tends to line up because

01:12:41.409 --> 01:12:43.506
there's a torque,
p cross E,

01:12:43.506 --> 01:12:44.448
trying to line it up.
 

01:12:44.448 --> 01:12:48.059
With that torque you can
associate a potential energy by

01:12:48.059 --> 01:12:51.798
the usual formula that the
torque is minus a derivative of

01:12:51.798 --> 01:12:53.439
the potential energy.
 

01:12:53.439 --> 01:12:56.310
That potential energy is
-p dot E.

01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:59.310
Some of these things may come
in handy later on.

01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:02.243
So you don't have to memorize
them, but they'll be involved

01:13:02.243 --> 01:13:02.800
later on.
 

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.000

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.810
Prof: Okay everybody,
let's start in.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.316
Today I want to talk about
green building and the

00:00:06.316 --> 00:00:10.627
opportunity to also think about
the laws that surround green

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:13.503
building,
and also the energy

00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:17.600
implications of green building
standards.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.310
And I'd like to also address
the history by having you think

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.381
about the way that these
standards have evolved over

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:28.898
time,
particularly the evolution of

00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:30.320
certification programs.
 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.578
So the idea of certification,
I want you to think about it

00:00:34.578 --> 00:00:36.820
quite broadly at the outset.
 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.564
Because it basically implies
that certain standards are being

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:42.000
applied to something.
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.340
It might be a product,
it could be a service.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.310
It could be a neighborhood,
a city.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.834
So that the idea that there is
an expert group that would

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:57.278
review something,
whether or not it's your

00:00:57.278 --> 00:01:00.250
academic preparation and
performance,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.130
or whether or not it's a
building's performance,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.608
and then certify it,
give it a symbol.

00:01:04.608 --> 00:01:07.718
It would rank it relative to
others.

00:01:07.718 --> 00:01:11.813
One obvious example would be
looking at a GPA on a

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:12.900
transcript.
 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.784
Well, what we'll see after
today's lecture is that the

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.780
green building programs that
have evolved in Europe,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.739
in the United States,
and Australia,

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:25.030
they really are based on that
same kind of concept.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.670
So how would you rate the
environmental and health

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.459
responsibility and energy
efficiency of new building

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:33.500
standards?
 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.288
How would they apply or how
might they apply to renovation

00:01:37.288 --> 00:01:38.019
projects?
 

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:42.152
So I'm basically going to use
the lecture today to share with

00:01:42.152 --> 00:01:46.354
you an overview of a paper that
will be published in about two

00:01:46.354 --> 00:01:49.110
weeks that is a critique of the
U.S.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.220
Green Building Council's
program known as LEED.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.595
So I'd like you also think
about the importance of the

00:01:57.595 --> 00:02:02.879
building sector in its demand
for energy in the United States.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:05.780
Buildings consume seventy-six
percent of the U.S.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.418
electricity and emit almost
half of the nation's greenhouse

00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:09.919
gases.
 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.570
So that how we manage the
future of building and

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.610
development will very much
influence the intensity of

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.009
energy demand.
 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.729
Keep in mind also that the U.S.
 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:25.004
consumes more energy than any
other country in the world,

00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:25.590
and U.S.
 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.319
consumers consume nearly
twenty-five percent of the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.759
world's energy and only accounts
for five percent of the world's

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:32.580
population.
 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.959
So that our energy demand is
increasing at about two percent

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:36.590
per year.
 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.580
So why might that be?
 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.000
I mean, obviously,
we're changing our behavior.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.857
We're changing our technology
and our dependence on

00:02:44.857 --> 00:02:45.598
technology.
 

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:49.811
And also the environments that
we shape around us have enormous

00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:53.750
implications for energy that
often are not well understood,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.720
for a variety of reasons.
 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.740
You, for example,
probably have no understanding

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.467
of how your daily behavior and
variability in your behavior

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:05.360
might influence your daily
energy demand.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.288
The way that you manage your
computers,

00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:09.188
the way that you manage your
windows,

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:12.788
your air exchange between
indoor and outdoor environments,

00:03:12.788 --> 00:03:15.653
the way you manage lights,
whether or not you have a car

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:16.280
on campus.
 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.030
If you do, how often do you use
it?

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.289
Where do you park it?
 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:20.810
What's its fuel efficiency?
 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.945
So thinking about how to keep
track of an individual's energy

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:29.220
demand is really not in most
people's minds clearly defined.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.276
So as I just said,
the contribution to the climate

00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:37.417
change problem and our
dependence on foreign oil is

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:42.384
really very much dependent upon
the way that we build and the

00:03:42.384 --> 00:03:47.848
way that we set up standards to
encourage energy efficiency.

00:03:47.848 --> 00:03:50.331
So thirty-nine percent of
CO_2 emissions come

00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:53.372
from the building sector,
forty percent of total energy

00:03:53.372 --> 00:03:56.578
consumption,
thirteen percent of water

00:03:56.578 --> 00:03:59.985
consumption,
and about fifteen percent of

00:03:59.985 --> 00:04:04.604
gross domestic product per year
is associated with the building

00:04:04.604 --> 00:04:05.348
sector.
 

00:04:05.348 --> 00:04:08.468
Think about the different
patterns of growth and how the

00:04:08.468 --> 00:04:11.644
different patterns of growth and
neighborhood development

00:04:11.644 --> 00:04:13.968
influence the way that we use
energy.

00:04:13.968 --> 00:04:20.189
These houses are not connected,
so they can't gain any benefit

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:25.290
for heat conservation by having
adjoining walls.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.230
They all had their own yards.
 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.079
And in fact,
if you think about how people

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:31.199
move around in these kinds of
neighborhoods,

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.276
you'd realize that because of
the fencing in the back yard and

00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:39.286
without gates that go between
all the different lots it would

00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:43.432
be quite normal for somebody to
get in a car and then drive all

00:04:43.432 --> 00:04:47.509
the way around the block to take
their kids to somebody else's

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.519
house that might be less than a
baseball throw away.

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:55.274
So that patterns of development
encourage patterns of transit

00:04:55.274 --> 00:04:58.654
that have just an enormous
influence on the way that we

00:04:58.654 --> 00:05:03.189
consume electricity,
but also petroleum products.

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:07.430
So think also about the cities
in the nation that during the

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.601
1990s and over the past decade
have experienced some of the

00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:13.829
most rapid rates of growth.
 

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:15.129
Well, these include Las Vegas.
 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:20.733
And Las Vegas is expanding into
the desert in a manner and at a

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:24.620
density that is suburban,
it's sprawling.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.129
But it's unusual in Las Vegas
because of the arid environment.

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:33.615
So that the every house would
likely have a lawn,

00:05:33.615 --> 00:05:37.730
the lawn would require
sprinkling.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.860
Many of these houses also,
once they're built out,

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.649
would have swimming pools.
 

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:46.786
So that think about the way
that the use of water demands

00:05:46.786 --> 00:05:49.519
energy to not just move it
around,

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:52.913
not just the distribution,
but also filtration and also

00:05:52.913 --> 00:05:56.495
the energy that goes into
putting in the infrastructure to

00:05:56.495 --> 00:05:57.690
move it around.
 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.699
Now, on Thursday,
I'm going to come back and talk

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.526
more about the new town movement
in the United States and this

00:06:04.526 --> 00:06:08.038
problem of managing growth at a
larger scale than today's

00:06:08.038 --> 00:06:10.230
lecture,
which is really focused on the

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.149
individual buildings.
 

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:16.607
But it is interesting that a
movement evolved in the 1960s

00:06:16.607 --> 00:06:22.160
and 1970s in the United States
to design neighborhoods,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.708
to design whole new communities
in a way that would take into

00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:26.110
account some of these problems.
 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.430
Irvine, California is the
example in this slide.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.259
And you can see the center of
the campus,

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.658
but you can also see the large
academic buildings surrounding a

00:06:36.658 --> 00:06:39.798
green in the center,
and then in the adjacent areas,

00:06:39.798 --> 00:06:41.920
you have recreational
facilities,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.370
but also higher density housing
nearby.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.125
So a very walkable community,
one that is not based on the

00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:53.598
idea of segregating land uses,
commercial versus residential

00:06:53.598 --> 00:06:55.910
versus industrial versus
recreational.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.310
So that in suburban
Connecticut, you put your kids

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.680
in a car and you drive from the
area where you live to where you

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.290
work to the recreational area to
dance lessons,

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.550
whatever it is.
 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.915
So that this community was
intentionally designed back in

00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:17.514
the '60s and '70s in a way that
would provide for mixed land

00:07:17.514 --> 00:07:21.958
uses and offer opportunities for
much increased pedestrian

00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.050
traffic.
 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.370
As opposed to suburban areas
around New Haven,

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.062
here's an example of a
community about twenty miles

00:07:30.062 --> 00:07:33.310
away that many of my colleagues
live in.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.447
And this is zoning at a scale
of about one unit per four to

00:07:38.447 --> 00:07:39.600
five acres.
 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.365
So each of these houses has a
strip of land that reaches back

00:07:44.365 --> 00:07:49.529
from it into an area that might
otherwise be common open space.

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:54.389
So that this low-density
development demands even more

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:57.600
time spent in cars and more
fuel.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.879
A good example of a house in a
more rural part of Connecticut.

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:06.483
So keep these things in mind as
you're thinking about your own

00:08:06.483 --> 00:08:08.944
behavior,
the way you grew up,

00:08:08.944 --> 00:08:12.754
and you try to consider how
your lifestyle choices

00:08:12.754 --> 00:08:16.329
influenced your family's
consumption level.

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:20.230
Also, I want you to think about
the idea of size,

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.663
and how we are increasingly
dependent upon many consumer

00:08:24.663 --> 00:08:29.579
products in our lives that are
larger than they used to be.

00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:32.350
And housing is no exception.
 

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:38.110
So that the average house size
in 2009 is grown to about 2,500

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:43.398
square feet, with about two
point three on average people

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:44.720
per house.
 

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.370
That's really pretty remarkable.
 

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.952
So you know,
roughly 1,000 square feet per

00:08:48.952 --> 00:08:49.519
person.
 

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:53.715
Whereas back in 1950,
the average number of people in

00:08:53.715 --> 00:08:56.620
a house was much closer to
three,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.928
a little bit over three with
the post-World War II baby boom,

00:09:00.928 --> 00:09:03.600
with a total size of 800 square
feet.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.789
So the house size has grown by
three fold.

00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:10.450
In 1970, it grew to 1,500 feet.
 

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.756
So the energy demands of a
larger house like that are

00:09:13.756 --> 00:09:17.446
actually quite difficult to
predict if you try to take into

00:09:17.446 --> 00:09:20.500
account the diversity of
building materials.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.360
Boy, I apologize for this.
 

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.100
And, you know,
one of you might go outside and

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.509
let them know that there's a
lecture going on in here.

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:30.009
That would be really nice.
 

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:35.610
The construction is creating
also diesel fumes inside the

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.710
building.
 

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:42.693
Many of the garages that you
find in suburban areas also have

00:09:42.693 --> 00:09:44.288
grown in size.
 

00:09:44.288 --> 00:09:47.270
So here's an example of a
garage that is actually larger

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.820
than the average house size was
back in 1950.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.591
This is probably about a
twenty-two, twenty-three by

00:09:53.591 --> 00:09:55.070
thirty foot house.
 

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.110
So that's roughly 1,200 square
feet, pretty interesting.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.769
Now think about the way that
space is laid out.

00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:04.769
So here's a studio apartment on
the right hand side.

00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:07.868
And you see a dining table,
a kitchenette,

00:10:07.868 --> 00:10:11.418
walk-in closet and a bath on
the upper level.

00:10:11.418 --> 00:10:15.590
Whereas the base level is
dominated by a garage.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:21.673
So that we're allocating less
space indoors to our bedrooms

00:10:21.673 --> 00:10:25.870
than we are to our auto storage
areas.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:30.557
Also, many buildings are now
constructed with much more glass

00:10:30.557 --> 00:10:32.590
in them than previously.
 

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.788
And the newer high-end
buildings are using special

00:10:36.788 --> 00:10:41.503
glass that is designed to
reflect radiation so that it's

00:10:41.503 --> 00:10:42.960
not absorbed.
 

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.692
But different glasses are
really designed for different

00:10:46.692 --> 00:10:50.907
climatic regions so that some
are more efficient at reflecting

00:10:50.907 --> 00:10:54.500
radiation that are used in
southern climates that are

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.399
warmer.
 

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:59.686
And others are more efficient
at providing insulation,

00:10:59.686 --> 00:11:04.779
so they've got a barrier in the
interior that basically protects

00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:06.558
against heat loss.
 

00:11:06.558 --> 00:11:12.389
So that overall though,
buildings' increased use of

00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:17.870
windows has created increased
energy demands.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.610
Also lighting.
 

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.880
And also the way that we have
increasingly designed bathrooms

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.158
to have more than one fixture.
 

00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:29.690
So here's an example of a
shower stall that has multiple

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.129
showerheads in it,
multiple faucets.

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:37.663
So that water demand is often
increased in bathrooms designed

00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:38.769
like this.
 

00:11:38.769 --> 00:11:43.561
Most green building programs
also attempt to regulate the

00:11:43.561 --> 00:11:47.840
building materials that are used
in furnishings.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.251
So here's an example of a
bookcase and set of drawers that

00:11:52.251 --> 00:11:54.730
seemingly are made out of oak.
 

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.928
But this is actually an oak
veneer.

00:11:57.928 --> 00:12:01.306
And if you have been up in
Kroon Hall where the Forestry

00:12:01.306 --> 00:12:03.700
and Environmental Studies School
is,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.418
you may know that about seventy
percent of the wood that's on

00:12:07.418 --> 00:12:10.580
the interior of this was grown
on Yale property,

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.830
on Yale forests.
 

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.019
It also is red oak,
but it's solid red oak.

00:12:15.019 --> 00:12:16.539
It's not a veneer.
 

00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:18.230
So what's beneath the veneer?
 

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:24.490
Here you can see a strip of
pressboard that is faced with a

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.649
white oak surface.
 

00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:30.332
But the interior is basically
low-grade wood chips of a

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:34.427
variety of different species
that are compressed together and

00:12:34.427 --> 00:12:38.793
they are mixed up in liquid form
with adhesives and then they are

00:12:38.793 --> 00:12:42.953
rolled out in a strip and then
cut into a variety of different

00:12:42.953 --> 00:12:43.908
sizes.
 

00:12:43.908 --> 00:12:49.138
The adhesives have compounds
that are often proprietary and

00:12:49.138 --> 00:12:53.916
even unknown to most who
purchase them or sell them at

00:12:53.916 --> 00:12:56.350
building supply houses.
 

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.131
They commonly contain adhesives
that are epoxy resins,

00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:03.913
some of which contain
bisphenol-A that we talked about

00:13:03.913 --> 00:13:05.769
earlier in the course.
 

00:13:05.769 --> 00:13:09.784
But also formaldehyde is a
component that is commonly used

00:13:09.784 --> 00:13:13.590
that is an allergen and it's a
suspected carcinogen.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.976
I'd like you to think too about
the problem of your

00:13:16.976 --> 00:13:18.058
understanding.
 

00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:21.366
How could you increase your
understanding of the energy

00:13:21.366 --> 00:13:23.450
intensity of your own lifestyle?
 

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.998
Well, here's a pretty good
example of the way that houses

00:13:27.998 --> 00:13:32.710
that were built in the 1990s and
previously are metered.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.160
So that this is at your utility
junction box,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.389
where the line comes in from
the road.

00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:38.940
This is my meter.
 

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.740
I have the same brand.
 

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.610
And it's got five dials on it.
 

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.395
And you might think,
well that's not that tough to

00:13:45.395 --> 00:13:45.870
figure out.
 

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.277
But if you walk up to it,
you'll see that the dials

00:13:48.277 --> 00:13:51.360
actually have the numbers that
on the first dial on the left,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.629
it goes from lowest to highest
in a clockwise motion.

00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:58.123
But in the second it goes from
lowest to highest in a

00:13:58.123 --> 00:13:59.370
counterclockwise motion.
 

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:03.210
So they switch on as you move
across the screen.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.125
So this is actually a very
difficult thing to keep track

00:14:06.125 --> 00:14:06.389
of.
 

00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:13.668
Now also, you might wonder
well, how would I find out how

00:14:13.668 --> 00:14:19.960
my variance in behavior,
how I manage my computers or my

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.413
lights or my water consumption,
or how big a refrigerator I

00:14:24.413 --> 00:14:27.288
have, how is that going to
affect my electric bill?

00:14:27.288 --> 00:14:29.417
It's really hard to figure it
out given this kind of a

00:14:29.417 --> 00:14:30.139
metering system.
 

00:14:30.139 --> 00:14:34.285
Because if you can decipher
what the meter says,

00:14:34.285 --> 00:14:39.048
you'll only get a total figure
for your consumption.

00:14:39.048 --> 00:14:43.408
Now, this has created an
opportunity for people to design

00:14:43.408 --> 00:14:48.154
a variety of smart meters that
keep track of energy intake and

00:14:48.154 --> 00:14:53.370
use and how it's distributed in
a house for different purposes.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:57.643
So that I tried to figure this
out given my dial meter at my

00:14:57.643 --> 00:15:01.770
home and ended up turning off
absolutely everything in the

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.610
house and then starting up
appliances one by one.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.025
So I'd start the refrigerator
and I'd turn the refrigerator

00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:09.379
off.
 

00:15:09.379 --> 00:15:11.472
I'd start a dryer,
start a dishwasher,

00:15:11.472 --> 00:15:14.471
but that would be the only
appliance that I would have

00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:15.149
running.
 

00:15:15.149 --> 00:15:19.437
But you can imagine,
every time you plug in one and

00:15:19.437 --> 00:15:23.470
then go out to the meter and
take a reading,

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.533
come back in,
unplug it and plug in something

00:15:26.533 --> 00:15:28.576
else,
it's going to take you a very

00:15:28.576 --> 00:15:31.548
long time to figure out where
you're spending your money.

00:15:31.548 --> 00:15:35.558
By doing that over a period of
about eight hours,

00:15:35.558 --> 00:15:39.162
I was able to save about
twenty-five percent of my

00:15:39.162 --> 00:15:43.427
average monthly energy bill by
figuring out how to restrict

00:15:43.427 --> 00:15:47.177
access or fully turn off
different appliances in the

00:15:47.177 --> 00:15:48.058
house.
 

00:15:48.058 --> 00:15:51.980
Building products and building
construction is normally

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.884
regulated by a variety of
building codes,

00:15:54.884 --> 00:15:58.658
many of which have been adopted
internationally.

00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:01.558
So that these codes apply to
materials,

00:16:01.558 --> 00:16:07.057
they apply to electrical
systems, they apply to energy

00:16:07.057 --> 00:16:09.450
sources,
fire prevention,

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.511
mechanical, heating and
ventilation and air condition

00:16:13.511 --> 00:16:15.600
systems,
plumbing.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.524
They even apply to historical
sites and in earthquake-prone

00:16:19.524 --> 00:16:23.410
parts of the country,
they have a code that is

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:28.308
distinctive in California for
earthquake stability.

00:16:28.308 --> 00:16:32.655
So that these codes evolved
originally as being voluntary,

00:16:32.655 --> 00:16:36.850
so that they were not formally
adopted by state or local

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.070
governments.
 

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.148
But now you'll find most states
do have similar kinds of

00:16:41.148 --> 00:16:42.100
building codes.
 

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.659
And they were originally
designed to promote

00:16:45.659 --> 00:16:49.966
understanding of the
functionality and the safety and

00:16:49.966 --> 00:16:54.190
the durability of different
kinds of products,

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.440
also to promote truth in
labeling.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.609
But they never really were
designed to promote

00:17:00.609 --> 00:17:04.553
environmental responsibility,
health protection or energy

00:17:04.553 --> 00:17:05.608
efficiency.
 

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:09.757
So that the green building
movement was really ripe for a

00:17:09.757 --> 00:17:14.125
brand new certification system
that would apply a variety of

00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:16.568
different kinds of standards.
 

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:21.087
And the three programs that
I'll mention today include the

00:17:21.087 --> 00:17:23.150
LEED program by the U.S.
 

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.119
Green Building Council,
the BREEAM program in the

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:28.843
United Kingdom,
and the Green Star program in

00:17:28.843 --> 00:17:29.710
Australia.
 

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.887
And the BRE Environmental
Assessment Method is perhaps the

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:38.140
best known in the world right
now, and it's the most widely

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.338
adopted throughout Europe.
 

00:17:40.338 --> 00:17:44.597
And it set standards for best
practices in sustainable design

00:17:44.597 --> 00:17:48.713
and has become really a de facto
measure used to describe a

00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:52.617
building's environmental
performance within the European

00:17:52.617 --> 00:17:53.470
Union.
 

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.180
Australia has the Green Star
program,

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.868
which is national,
it's also voluntary,

00:17:58.868 --> 00:18:02.730
that evaluates construction,
environmental design,

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:07.858
and has been particularly well
developed for commercial

00:18:07.858 --> 00:18:11.037
structures,
especially office buildings in

00:18:11.037 --> 00:18:13.906
downtown districts,
where about eleven percent of

00:18:13.906 --> 00:18:16.844
the buildings have been
constructed and certified under

00:18:16.844 --> 00:18:17.660
the program.
 

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.031
So its purposes are to first of
all, try to figure out a common

00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:24.078
language and common definition
for what "green"

00:18:24.078 --> 00:18:24.460
is.
 

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:28.240
So that before the National
Organic Food Standard was

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.372
adopted,
there was no national

00:18:30.372 --> 00:18:33.990
consistency in the definition of
what organic food was,

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.788
so it varied by certification
scheme.

00:18:36.788 --> 00:18:41.200
The Green Star program also
sets measurement standards.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.817
So that there is a common
approach to measuring say energy

00:18:46.817 --> 00:18:52.634
consumption or the capacity of
different building materials,

00:18:52.634 --> 00:18:55.690
such as electrical conduit.
 

00:18:55.690 --> 00:19:00.150
And they also promoted a whole
building design,

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.079
so that one would think about
not just the individual

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:05.265
components,
the individual building

00:19:05.265 --> 00:19:07.509
materials or the different
systems,

00:19:07.509 --> 00:19:09.568
and by systems,
I mean like water supply,

00:19:09.568 --> 00:19:11.885
electrical supply,
perhaps the heating and

00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:14.788
ventilation system,
plumbing.

00:19:14.788 --> 00:19:19.429
But to figure out how to put
all of these components together

00:19:19.429 --> 00:19:23.991
in a way that would minimize the
long-term adverse affect on

00:19:23.991 --> 00:19:28.400
environmental quality or human
health or energy loss.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.567
So this idea that one would
think about building materials

00:19:32.567 --> 00:19:37.248
and the style of design in a way
that would consider the ultimate

00:19:37.248 --> 00:19:40.744
product lifecycle,
this is really a pretty new

00:19:40.744 --> 00:19:42.828
idea in the building industry.
 

00:19:42.828 --> 00:19:45.459
So that, you know,
what's going to happen to that

00:19:45.459 --> 00:19:48.582
PVC pipe that exists in your
house when your building gets

00:19:48.582 --> 00:19:49.348
torn down?
 

00:19:49.348 --> 00:19:54.625
What's going to happen to the
copper piping that delivers the

00:19:54.625 --> 00:19:55.328
water?
 

00:19:55.328 --> 00:19:58.623
Well, the PVC pipe,
you can almost be assured is

00:19:58.623 --> 00:20:02.758
going to be either burned or
it's going to be discarded in a

00:20:02.758 --> 00:20:03.670
landfill.
 

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:09.316
But the copper piping is highly
likely to be recycled because of

00:20:09.316 --> 00:20:11.019
its market value.
 

00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:14.496
So differences in these
programs are normally associated

00:20:14.496 --> 00:20:18.353
with the way that they allocate
credits or points to buildings

00:20:18.353 --> 00:20:20.058
for different purposes.
 

00:20:20.058 --> 00:20:25.070
But they really are quite
similar in their attempt to

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:30.180
promote energy conservation,
concern for chemical life

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.650
cycles, as well as human health.
 

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:38.140
So the Green Building Council
evolved, beginning in 1993.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.522
And this is what I want to
focus on now for the remainder

00:20:41.522 --> 00:20:42.548
of the session.
 

00:20:42.548 --> 00:20:46.292
And it is a voluntary nonprofit
organization that has no

00:20:46.292 --> 00:20:49.763
government affiliation,
although it was started by a

00:20:49.763 --> 00:20:51.329
grant from the U.S.
 

00:20:51.329 --> 00:20:52.588
Energy Department.
 

00:20:52.588 --> 00:20:57.761
So this is created with a board
of directors that include people

00:20:57.761 --> 00:21:02.113
that have expertise in
architecture and engineering as

00:21:02.113 --> 00:21:06.298
well as some of the largest
development firms,

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.000
construction firms,
in the nation.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.019
There are really not a number
of people on this board or on

00:21:14.019 --> 00:21:18.087
the staff that have deep
environmental or health

00:21:18.087 --> 00:21:19.298
expertise.
 

00:21:19.298 --> 00:21:22.368
And its orientation has
predominantly been to promote

00:21:22.368 --> 00:21:23.548
energy efficiency.
 

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:27.692
They claim that the benefits of
this leadership in energy and

00:21:27.692 --> 00:21:30.556
environmental design,
which is what the LEED acronym

00:21:30.556 --> 00:21:32.842
stands for,
that it has three predominant

00:21:32.842 --> 00:21:33.450
purposes.
 

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.318
One is to promote environmental
quality.

00:21:35.318 --> 00:21:39.222
The second is economic
development to basically

00:21:39.222 --> 00:21:44.569
stimulate a new type of building
and new building materials that

00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:48.049
are more environmentally
responsible.

00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:51.500
Sorry about the noise.
 

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:57.316
And also to promote healthy
lifestyles within buildings and

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.720
communities.
 

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.590
And by healthy lifestyles
within a building,

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.808
I'll give you one example.
 

00:22:01.808 --> 00:22:05.047
A colleague of mine works at
the Centers for Disease Control

00:22:05.047 --> 00:22:08.009
in Atlanta, and they have a
relatively new building.

00:22:08.009 --> 00:22:10.450
And just as a healthy lifestyle
attribute,

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:14.526
they decided that instead of
putting a staircase in the back

00:22:14.526 --> 00:22:18.808
of the building and the elevator
right near the front door when

00:22:18.808 --> 00:22:22.318
people walked in,
that they would reverse that.

00:22:22.318 --> 00:22:26.233
So the elevator was put in the
back and the staircase was

00:22:26.233 --> 00:22:30.150
surrounded by glass panels that
made it really light,

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.519
sunlight steams through and
attractive.

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:34.984
So that people,
when they go into the building,

00:22:34.984 --> 00:22:37.772
normally walk up the stairs,
a seven- or eight- story

00:22:37.772 --> 00:22:38.470
building.
 

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.578
So that this individual who
directed the National Center for

00:22:42.578 --> 00:22:46.338
Environmental Health told me
that he and his staff,

00:22:46.338 --> 00:22:49.599
that nobody uses the elevator,
everybody goes up and down the

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:50.088
stairs.
 

00:22:50.088 --> 00:22:55.180
So it saves energy,
the elevator is not used much.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:23:00.230
And it also is healthy,
it's burning up calories.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.713
So that the purpose of LEED
falls into a variety of

00:23:03.713 --> 00:23:04.618
categories.
 

00:23:04.618 --> 00:23:07.696
One is sustainable sites,
another is water efficiency,

00:23:07.696 --> 00:23:10.773
another is energy and
atmosphere, another is materials

00:23:10.773 --> 00:23:11.818
and resources.
 

00:23:11.818 --> 00:23:14.763
The fifth is indoor
environmental quality,

00:23:14.763 --> 00:23:18.499
and the fourth is really
creativity and innovation in

00:23:18.499 --> 00:23:19.288
design.
 

00:23:19.288 --> 00:23:22.902
So I mean, you might image
different categories might be a

00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:24.930
part of a system such as this.
 

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.039
But there are interesting
questions about the relative

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:31.210
importance that these categories
should be assigned.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.715
Should you be assigned as much
about the nature of the site

00:23:34.715 --> 00:23:36.470
that's chosen for building?
 

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:40.877
Whether or not it's remote and
is going to be in a green field

00:23:40.877 --> 00:23:44.780
area as opposed to the site that
might be hazardous and

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.009
contaminated?
 

00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:50.115
So that the Kroon Hall up on
Prospect Street across from the

00:23:50.115 --> 00:23:54.288
Whale, Kroon Hall was built on a
highly contaminated site.

00:23:54.288 --> 00:23:57.170
So that a former power plant
was there,

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.676
and a lot of work had to be
done to clean that site up to

00:24:00.676 --> 00:24:04.558
remove contaminated debris as
well as other infrastructure,

00:24:04.558 --> 00:24:10.349
the heating and electrical and
hot air conduits that go from

00:24:10.349 --> 00:24:14.078
the power plant up to Science
Hill,

00:24:14.078 --> 00:24:15.640
particularly Kline Science
Tower.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:21.760
So that the idea that you would
give more credits to a building

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:27.586
program that would not chew up
undisturbed areas that are in

00:24:27.586 --> 00:24:31.990
say the suburbs,
you'd give more credit to those

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:35.299
that were actively going to
restore sites,

00:24:35.299 --> 00:24:36.730
is an interesting concept.
 

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:42.324
The certification program that
I'm going to talk about today

00:24:42.324 --> 00:24:46.970
has to do with new construction
and renovation.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.164
Although there are other
programs that LEED has,

00:24:50.164 --> 00:24:54.038
for example a program for
schools, a program for homes.

00:24:54.038 --> 00:24:57.508
So that in this program,
there are a hundred base points

00:24:57.508 --> 00:24:59.588
plus ten possible bonus points.
 

00:24:59.588 --> 00:25:03.826
And there are different levels
of certification that can be

00:25:03.826 --> 00:25:04.630
achieved.
 

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:09.586
So if you achieve forty to
forty-nine points,

00:25:09.586 --> 00:25:11.838
you are certified.
 

00:25:11.838 --> 00:25:15.512
Up to fifty to fifty-nine
points, you're given a silver

00:25:15.512 --> 00:25:17.624
certification,
a gold is sixty to

00:25:17.624 --> 00:25:19.904
seventy-nine,
and then platinum is eighty to

00:25:19.904 --> 00:25:21.390
a hundred and ten points.
 

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:25.772
You could imagine a variety of
different strategies here that

00:25:25.772 --> 00:25:30.156
would hold the bar higher for
the base level of certification

00:25:30.156 --> 00:25:34.759
or perhaps hold the bar higher
for only the platinum level.

00:25:34.759 --> 00:25:37.832
The Kroon Building was just
certified to be a platinum

00:25:37.832 --> 00:25:39.338
building, as an example.
 

00:25:39.338 --> 00:25:44.488
So these are the different
kinds of certification programs

00:25:44.488 --> 00:25:47.828
that LEED has beneath its
umbrella.

00:25:47.828 --> 00:25:49.903
And as I mentioned,
the first one,

00:25:49.903 --> 00:25:52.980
new construction and
renovation, is the subject of

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.048
today's talk.
 

00:25:54.048 --> 00:25:58.353
But also, schools,
core and shell components of

00:25:58.353 --> 00:26:00.635
buildings,
neighborhood development,

00:26:00.635 --> 00:26:02.824
retail facilities,
healthcare facilities,

00:26:02.824 --> 00:26:05.548
commercial interiors,
and homes.

00:26:05.548 --> 00:26:12.108
Sorry, I've got a couple of
duplicate slides here.

00:26:12.108 --> 00:26:15.470
So I'd like you to think about
sustainable sites.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:21.555
Credits can be awarded for
building on previously developed

00:26:21.555 --> 00:26:22.288
land.
 

00:26:22.288 --> 00:26:25.573
They give additional credits
for minimizing impacts on

00:26:25.573 --> 00:26:28.980
ecosystems and waterways,
for promoting landscaping that

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.838
is regionally appropriate.
 

00:26:30.838 --> 00:26:33.595
So if for example,
in the slide that I showed in

00:26:33.595 --> 00:26:35.960
Arizona,
if you were trying to get LEED

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.032
certification for a new project,
you would need to be very

00:26:39.032 --> 00:26:41.548
careful about the kind of
landscaping that you put in,

00:26:41.548 --> 00:26:45.009
making certain that it wasn't
water dependent.

00:26:45.009 --> 00:26:49.797
Whether or not the building
site encourages access to public

00:26:49.797 --> 00:26:52.394
transportation,
so proximity say,

00:26:52.394 --> 00:26:57.019
to a rail station would improve
the number of points.

00:26:57.019 --> 00:27:00.828
The control of storm water
runoff, and erosion.

00:27:00.828 --> 00:27:04.417
So as an example there,
Kroon Hall has a very large

00:27:04.417 --> 00:27:08.940
gutter that overhangs the south
side and funnels water down into

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:13.750
that water garden that is on the
eastern side of the structure.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:18.332
Then that water moves through a
filtration plant inside the

00:27:18.332 --> 00:27:22.343
building,
and then is recycled into gray

00:27:22.343 --> 00:27:25.364
water,
so that it is used for removal

00:27:25.364 --> 00:27:27.788
of human waste in the bathrooms.
 

00:27:27.788 --> 00:27:31.489
Well, also, here's an example
of how that building achieved

00:27:31.489 --> 00:27:34.358
certain points by the
restoration program,

00:27:34.358 --> 00:27:39.082
digging out the old
contaminated lands and

00:27:39.082 --> 00:27:40.578
rebuilding.
 

00:27:40.578 --> 00:27:43.200
So for each of these
categories, I'm not going to

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.618
spend much time on this.
 

00:27:44.618 --> 00:27:47.505
But for each of the categories,
you can achieve points in

00:27:47.505 --> 00:27:48.690
different directions.
 

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:51.729
And you can imagine that the
way that these points are

00:27:51.729 --> 00:27:55.226
allocated category by category
could have a pretty significant

00:27:55.226 --> 00:27:57.750
implication for providing
encouragement.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.385
By the way, why would a
developer want to be LEED

00:28:00.385 --> 00:28:01.430
certified anyway?
 

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:02.808
What's the value?
 

00:28:02.808 --> 00:28:11.434
Well, I mentioned one value
that would be to the building

00:28:11.434 --> 00:28:17.346
industry at large,
which is creating an incentive

00:28:17.346 --> 00:28:22.970
for a new line of products and a
new approach to building design

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:28.950
that would create jobs and cause
the industry to grow generally.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.804
But most developers are in this
because they know that if they

00:28:32.804 --> 00:28:36.470
achieve certification and the
property value is higher,

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:42.180
they can demand a premium for
the structure or the complex.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:46.440
So that in this case,
the sustainable sites category

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.867
allows one to seek about
twenty-three percent of total

00:28:50.867 --> 00:28:54.210
number of credits that are
possible.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:58.170
So that these can be awarded
for brownfield redevelopment,

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:03.902
for alternative transportation,
the bike storage area that you

00:29:03.902 --> 00:29:09.445
find behind Osborne Laboratory
caused FES to gain additional

00:29:09.445 --> 00:29:10.480
points.
 

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.887
The management of storm water,
trying to manage a heat island

00:29:16.887 --> 00:29:23.190
effect, reduce that intensity of
heat absorption by creating

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:24.900
green roofs.
 

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.890
There was a green roof that's
on part of that site.

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:32.602
Water efficiency also is a
source of possible points,

00:29:32.602 --> 00:29:35.029
about nine percent of the
total.

00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:40.130
So that within this category,
appliance efficiency,

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:44.127
fixtures and fittings are good
examples of different ways of

00:29:44.127 --> 00:29:47.855
saving water as well as the
landscaping that I mentioned

00:29:47.855 --> 00:29:48.670
earlier.
 

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.000
And I wanted to mention a
couple of kind of relatively

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.950
recent technological designs.
 

00:29:53.950 --> 00:30:00.625
One is these leverless faucets
that sense your presence,

00:30:00.625 --> 00:30:08.152
either by an electronic eye or
sensing heat that causes them to

00:30:08.152 --> 00:30:10.579
turn on and off.
 

00:30:10.579 --> 00:30:12.150
And it's kind of interesting.
 

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:16.211
You know, I have become more
curious about this and watch

00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:20.416
people's hand washing behavior,
particularly in places like

00:30:20.416 --> 00:30:21.358
airports.
 

00:30:21.358 --> 00:30:25.265
And it's really common to have
a whole array of these things on

00:30:25.265 --> 00:30:26.210
a countertop.
 

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:29.573
And people often have to move
from one the other to get one to

00:30:29.573 --> 00:30:29.960
work.
 

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.961
And after that happens a number
of times, people I think are

00:30:33.961 --> 00:30:36.880
more likely just to not wash
their hands.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.153
So there's a sanitation problem
that is potentially associated

00:30:40.153 --> 00:30:40.690
with it.
 

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:44.009
If you go into the men's rooms
and look at the flushless

00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:47.269
urinals, you will immediately
recognize that there is a

00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:49.019
serious problem in Kroon.
 

00:30:49.019 --> 00:30:54.678
And it's led many to argue that
they really would rather make

00:30:54.678 --> 00:30:59.865
the tradeoff between the odor in
the bathroom that might

00:30:59.865 --> 00:31:04.392
otherwise be managed by
improving the heating and

00:31:04.392 --> 00:31:06.750
ventilation system.
 

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.666
So that right now,
no water is used in this

00:31:10.666 --> 00:31:15.518
toilet, only a synthetic
compound is put in to try to

00:31:15.518 --> 00:31:18.130
maintain its sanitation.
 

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:22.799
But it often is not as
effective as it is promoted to

00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:23.250
be.
 

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:28.700
So that water efficiency can be
achieved in a variety of ways.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:36.496
The faucets themselves are
often fitted with restrictions

00:31:36.496 --> 00:31:43.736
in flow so that if you're
interested in taking a more

00:31:43.736 --> 00:31:47.913
powerful shower,
you'll need to figure out how

00:31:47.913 --> 00:31:52.250
to get the flow restrictor out,
which many people do try.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:56.291
The flow restrictor itself is
governed by local and state

00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:57.519
building codes.
 

00:31:57.519 --> 00:32:01.349
And it was kind of interesting
to me, it was an education for

00:32:01.349 --> 00:32:01.670
me.
 

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:04.296
When I wondered,
I asked a plumber who was

00:32:04.296 --> 00:32:06.730
installing a new faucet in my
sink,

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:09.589
and I said, you know,
I really would like a larger

00:32:09.589 --> 00:32:12.974
rate of flow in this sink so
that I could be more effective

00:32:12.974 --> 00:32:14.960
in washing dishes or whatever.
 

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.594
And he said,
well you know,

00:32:16.594 --> 00:32:20.178
you really don't understand the
energy implications of not

00:32:20.178 --> 00:32:21.750
restricting the flow.
 

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:26.944
And if you thought about it,
then you'd realize that the

00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:32.519
energy costs are really quite
high to move the water to your

00:32:32.519 --> 00:32:33.368
home.
 

00:32:33.368 --> 00:32:35.118
And I said, "Well,
I've got my own well."

00:32:35.118 --> 00:32:39.464
He said, "Well think about
where the energy is coming from

00:32:39.464 --> 00:32:43.038
that causes your pump to lift
the water 600 feet.

00:32:43.038 --> 00:32:47.259
And then also think about the
more water that you use,

00:32:47.259 --> 00:32:49.911
the more waste you create,
so you're likely to disperse

00:32:49.911 --> 00:32:52.759
biological and chemical
contaminants more broadly."

00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:57.030
So my plumber gave me a lesson
in environmental behavior that I

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.029
thought was quite valuable.
 

00:32:59.029 --> 00:33:02.528
So the majority,
not the majority,

00:33:02.528 --> 00:33:06.555
but the highest proportion of
points or credits are awarded

00:33:06.555 --> 00:33:10.788
under the LEED program for
energy and atmospheric concerns.

00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:14.430
So that new buildings can
obtain points by monitoring

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.440
energy consumption,
and this is being pretty

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.798
carefully done in Kroon Hall,
as an example.

00:33:20.798 --> 00:33:24.519
And the orientation of the
building,

00:33:24.519 --> 00:33:27.430
of Kroon, it's facing east to
west,

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:31.405
so that it has more window
space on the south side to

00:33:31.405 --> 00:33:33.700
absorb more solar radiation.
 

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:39.613
It also has solar panels that
run across the south side and a

00:33:39.613 --> 00:33:43.259
variety of other saving
techniques.

00:33:43.259 --> 00:33:48.275
So that the dominance of energy
and energy conservation in the

00:33:48.275 --> 00:33:53.209
LEED certification and credit
program relative to these other

00:33:53.209 --> 00:33:56.170
categories is quite interesting.
 

00:33:56.170 --> 00:34:00.595
With respect to materials and
resources, the management of

00:34:00.595 --> 00:34:04.165
waste is also more intensely
monitored within a

00:34:04.165 --> 00:34:06.338
LEED-certified building.
 

00:34:06.338 --> 00:34:11.130
And when a building is actually
certified, it's not certified

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:15.123
forever, it's certified for a
fixed period of time,

00:34:15.123 --> 00:34:17.440
often only a single year.
 

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.534
And a building is not certified
until it can demonstrate that it

00:34:21.534 --> 00:34:24.719
has performed at a level of X
during that year.

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.750
So it's kind of an interesting
idea.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:31.391
If a building's heating and
ventilation system malfunctions,

00:34:31.391 --> 00:34:34.661
then a year or two down the
road, it's not going to be

00:34:34.661 --> 00:34:35.650
recertified.
 

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:40.594
Indoor environmental quality is
increasingly a concern,

00:34:40.594 --> 00:34:45.356
and only fifteen points
compared to about thirty-four

00:34:45.356 --> 00:34:48.469
points in the energy category.
 

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:50.851
Only fifteen points are
allocated for indoor

00:34:50.851 --> 00:34:52.179
environmental quality.
 

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:54.409
Now, what does that mean?
 

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:59.873
It generally means a concern
for the chemical content of the

00:34:59.873 --> 00:35:01.820
indoor environment.
 

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:06.550
But it also includes the
opportunity to gain points for

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:10.833
natural daylight and views,
and also for acoustical

00:35:10.833 --> 00:35:14.349
control, noise control,
so that the situation that

00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:17.130
we're experiencing here might be
avoided.

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:19.780
Now, you know,
again, think about the

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:24.125
importance of this in terms of
human chemical exposure given

00:35:24.125 --> 00:35:27.659
the fact that we spend so much
time indoors.

00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:30.750
You know this diagram is now a
couple of years old.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:37.050
But in the latter part of the
1990s,

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.389
EPA was estimating that about
eighty-six,

00:35:39.389 --> 00:35:41.429
eighty-seven percent of time
was spent indoors,

00:35:41.429 --> 00:35:44.619
about five percent of time was
spent in a vehicle.

00:35:44.619 --> 00:35:47.534
So thinking about the chemical
content of the indoor

00:35:47.534 --> 00:35:50.221
environment is important,
especially for certain

00:35:50.221 --> 00:35:51.650
subgroups, like kids.
 

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:54.409
This can be managed in a
variety of ways.

00:35:54.409 --> 00:35:57.065
And you could think,
well, the ventilation rate or

00:35:57.065 --> 00:35:59.235
the air exchange rate,
indoor to outdoor,

00:35:59.235 --> 00:36:01.742
is one way of doing that,
depending upon where your

00:36:01.742 --> 00:36:02.409
building is.
 

00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:05.128
So in general,
outdoor air quality is better

00:36:05.128 --> 00:36:08.603
than indoor air quality,
unless you live in proximity to

00:36:08.603 --> 00:36:11.070
an industrial area or to a
highway.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.903
So that being able to
mechanically and individually

00:36:14.903 --> 00:36:19.199
control windows is an important
strategy for managing air

00:36:19.199 --> 00:36:20.119
quality.
 

00:36:20.119 --> 00:36:23.552
But also thinking about a
variety of different materials

00:36:23.552 --> 00:36:27.360
and compounds that are brought
into the built environment,

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.179
so that some compounds and some
products are discouraged under

00:36:31.179 --> 00:36:32.119
this program.
 

00:36:32.119 --> 00:36:34.161
So that paints,
for example,

00:36:34.161 --> 00:36:38.320
that emit a high level of
volatile organic compounds are

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.530
discouraged.
 

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:43.271
So low emitting paints,
varnishes, polyurethanes,

00:36:43.271 --> 00:36:44.909
are now designated.
 

00:36:44.909 --> 00:36:49.596
So that if you look at the can
of oil-based paint,

00:36:49.596 --> 00:36:55.047
you'll find that roughly two
and a half pounds of volatile

00:36:55.047 --> 00:36:58.489
organic compounds are contained.
 

00:36:58.489 --> 00:37:02.282
Whereas certain paints are now
manufactured with no volatile

00:37:02.282 --> 00:37:03.570
organic compounds.
 

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:07.409
You might also think about the
compact fluorescents that pose

00:37:07.409 --> 00:37:11.380
kind of an interesting problem
in that they contain mercury.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.726
So that this is a piece of
personal advice for you,

00:37:15.726 --> 00:37:19.639
as you install or remove
compact fluorescents,

00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:22.510
be really careful about them.
 

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:25.922
Because if they break in your
room, it's going to scatter

00:37:25.922 --> 00:37:28.849
mercury around,
and the mercury will vaporize.

00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:32.139
If it gets into a rug and you
vacuum the rug,

00:37:32.139 --> 00:37:35.655
the rug is going to give off
the mercury vapors,

00:37:35.655 --> 00:37:39.320
and it will increase the
volatilization rate.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.485
And it will be just about
impossible to completely remove

00:37:42.485 --> 00:37:44.070
the mercury from the room.
 

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:49.172
So this is a problem associated
with the compact fluorescents

00:37:49.172 --> 00:37:54.273
that is turning into a rather
interesting and serious dilemma

00:37:54.273 --> 00:37:56.400
for waste management.
 

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.360
So not many people really want
to take an old burned out light

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.570
bulb back to a recycling center.
 

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:06.235
In fact, the probability of
getting it there without

00:38:06.235 --> 00:38:09.110
breaking it is probably not too
great.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:13.780
And also, think about again,
plastics and landfill.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.775
An increasing proportion of the
interior built environment is

00:38:16.775 --> 00:38:19.869
made up of a variety of plastics
that we've talked about in the

00:38:19.869 --> 00:38:20.320
past.
 

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:25.940
But the extremely low chance
that plastics are going to be

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:31.168
recycled is a logic to rethink
the way that points are

00:38:31.168 --> 00:38:32.550
allocated.
 

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:36.206
There was an interesting debate
inside the Green Building

00:38:36.206 --> 00:38:40.320
Council about polyvinylchloride
plastics and whether or not PVCs

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.043
ought to be either banned or
whether or not you would have

00:38:44.043 --> 00:38:48.460
credits removed if you used PVC,
as opposed to a more recyclable

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:53.519
product like polyethylene,
that most soda bottles are made

00:38:53.519 --> 00:38:54.389
out of.
 

00:38:54.389 --> 00:38:58.420
But they decided not to do
that, which is quite curious.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:03.226
So thinking about the kinds of
materials that are put down on

00:39:03.226 --> 00:39:05.469
floors, the sealants also.
 

00:39:05.469 --> 00:39:07.210
This is encouraged.
 

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:10.195
Credits can be gained if you
choose not just the low VOC

00:39:10.195 --> 00:39:12.260
paints, but also the clear
finishes.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.630
Also, you'll find a variety of
products,

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:18.423
including this type of a vinyl
flooring that you could see in

00:39:18.423 --> 00:39:21.592
Kroon Hall,
particularly in the stairwells,

00:39:21.592 --> 00:39:25.422
that gives off volatile
compounds that I haven't been

00:39:25.422 --> 00:39:29.398
able to identify and the
manufacturers are not required

00:39:29.398 --> 00:39:30.429
to label.
 

00:39:30.429 --> 00:39:36.449
So think about the variety of
different products that go into

00:39:36.449 --> 00:39:41.804
the construction of a building,
and how these products may

00:39:41.804 --> 00:39:45.469
change the chemical content of
that environment.

00:39:45.469 --> 00:39:51.739
So that the quality of the air
exchange system is really

00:39:51.739 --> 00:39:58.010
critical to govern the chemical
exposures that occur.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:00.699
And this is particularly the
case in a new building.

00:40:00.699 --> 00:40:03.389
As an example, rugs.
 

00:40:03.389 --> 00:40:09.943
Rugs may be made out of natural
products, natural fibers,

00:40:09.943 --> 00:40:16.967
such as wool or cotton or now
increasingly some reed material

00:40:16.967 --> 00:40:19.659
from South America.
 

00:40:19.659 --> 00:40:23.610
But rugs that are made out of
synthetic compounds and their

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:26.248
backing,
many are recommending that

00:40:26.248 --> 00:40:30.099
those be aired out in a
warehouse or in a garage for a

00:40:30.099 --> 00:40:33.070
period of time,
up to a couple weeks before

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:36.425
they're installed so that
occupants of new buildings would

00:40:36.425 --> 00:40:38.369
not be exposed to those fumes.
 

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:44.489
A couple of other examples that
are not managed by LEED.

00:40:44.489 --> 00:40:46.750
Certain golf courses have been
certified.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:50.286
Whereas the expectation on the
part of the Green Building

00:40:50.286 --> 00:40:54.012
Council is that the chemicals
that are used are regulated by

00:40:54.012 --> 00:40:56.539
the Environmental Protection
Agency.

00:40:56.539 --> 00:41:03.903
And the chemicals that are used
on golf courses are commonly

00:41:03.903 --> 00:41:07.150
quite a complex mixture.
 

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:10.679
And as you remember from the
pesticide section of the course,

00:41:10.679 --> 00:41:13.210
many of these have not been
fully tested.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:17.275
A variety of insulating
materials also can expose

00:41:17.275 --> 00:41:22.018
workers at levels that are
potentially hazardous to their

00:41:22.018 --> 00:41:22.949
health.
 

00:41:22.949 --> 00:41:28.309
So that some acrylics,
for example,

00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:33.786
that play an important role in
increasing the energy efficiency

00:41:33.786 --> 00:41:37.168
of a building,
but they can lead to worker

00:41:37.168 --> 00:41:38.630
exposure situations.
 

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.172
So thinking about whether or
not LEED should get involved in

00:41:42.172 --> 00:41:45.956
concern about the production of
the chemical and its application

00:41:45.956 --> 00:41:49.378
and the way that it's actually
used to build a building is

00:41:49.378 --> 00:41:50.460
interesting.
 

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.786
LEED has also certified a
bottling plant,

00:41:52.786 --> 00:41:55.230
raising kind of an interesting
question.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:58.456
Well, what if say DuPont
Corporation wanted to build a

00:41:58.456 --> 00:42:01.985
plant to produce a variety of
chemicals that were extremely

00:42:01.985 --> 00:42:05.003
hazardous,
and perhaps they got into water

00:42:05.003 --> 00:42:06.090
or air or soil.
 

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:11.164
Should they be allowed to get
platinum or LEED certification

00:42:11.164 --> 00:42:12.969
for that structure?
 

00:42:12.969 --> 00:42:19.061
Should Nestle be allowed to
gain certification for marketing

00:42:19.061 --> 00:42:23.809
products that are not likely to
be recycled?

00:42:23.809 --> 00:42:27.925
Here's another example of a
project that was certified in

00:42:27.925 --> 00:42:28.659
Florida.
 

00:42:28.659 --> 00:42:33.000
And you remember the lecture
last week about barrier islands.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.523
Well, this owner owns the tract
of land slicing across a barrier

00:42:38.523 --> 00:42:42.030
island from the bay to the
shoreline,

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.900
and obviously,
has quite intensively developed

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:45.219
it.
 

00:42:45.219 --> 00:42:49.262
You know, seeing the amount of
square footage in homes and the

00:42:49.262 --> 00:42:53.237
low occupancy rates has led me
to wonder about whether or not

00:42:53.237 --> 00:42:57.081
the government might think about
regulating square foot per

00:42:57.081 --> 00:42:59.599
person or cubic foot per person.
 

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:02.280
I mean, how much space do we
really need per person?

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.210
So I'm going to run through
just a few summary of findings

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:10.074
here before I close today that
should give you a sense of

00:43:10.074 --> 00:43:14.143
what's working and what's not
working too well with the LEED

00:43:14.143 --> 00:43:15.110
program.
 

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:20.606
These standards have been
designed by a voluntary

00:43:20.606 --> 00:43:23.469
nonprofit organization.
 

00:43:23.469 --> 00:43:26.380
But they've been adopted
increasingly at all levels of

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.480
government in law.
 

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:31.001
So they've been added to
Connecticut's laws,

00:43:31.001 --> 00:43:32.150
for example.
 

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:35.516
So that Connecticut now
requires that new buildings that

00:43:35.516 --> 00:43:39.007
are going to cost more than five
million dollars need LEED

00:43:39.007 --> 00:43:40.110
certification.
 

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:44.264
Many of the Department of
Energy's programs are now

00:43:44.264 --> 00:43:49.166
designed to encourage giving of
grants to projects that gain

00:43:49.166 --> 00:43:53.820
LEED certification or would gain
LEED certification.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.460
And many local governments are
now adopting these standards.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:01.161
So that what's happening here
is that the standards are being

00:44:01.161 --> 00:44:04.615
developed by a voluntary
nonprofit organization really to

00:44:04.615 --> 00:44:07.639
promote a new form of growth and
development.

00:44:07.639 --> 00:44:10.960
But they're being incorporated
wholesale into a variety of

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.047
different levels of government
without really thinking

00:44:14.047 --> 00:44:17.309
critically about what's working
well and what's not.

00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:21.543
There's now no federal
definition of what a green

00:44:21.543 --> 00:44:24.190
building standard should be.
 

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:27.648
Clearly this program gives a
higher priority to energy

00:44:27.648 --> 00:44:31.041
efficiency over indoor
environmental quality or human

00:44:31.041 --> 00:44:31.760
health.
 

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:37.338
And if I were going to design a
statute that would encourage

00:44:37.338 --> 00:44:40.722
green building,
it would certainly give

00:44:40.722 --> 00:44:45.262
increased precedence to public
health concerns and the chemical

00:44:45.262 --> 00:44:47.018
content of buildings.
 

00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:50.927
The Green Building Council has
very little expertise in human

00:44:50.927 --> 00:44:53.541
health,
and that in part explains why

00:44:53.541 --> 00:44:57.130
these standards are not well
developed in that area.

00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:00.963
Still, the green certification
program, the LEED program,

00:45:00.963 --> 00:45:04.250
gives a false impression of
healthy buildings.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:07.384
And tighter buildings are more
energy efficient,

00:45:07.384 --> 00:45:11.385
but tighter buildings also more
effectively contain chemicals

00:45:11.385 --> 00:45:13.320
that get into indoor air.
 

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.248
So that no level of
certification,

00:45:16.248 --> 00:45:20.065
even the highest level,
the platinum rating,

00:45:20.065 --> 00:45:22.730
assures health protection.
 

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:26.619
LEED also neglects drinking
water, so that drinking water

00:45:26.619 --> 00:45:30.715
supplies are managed in the
nation predominantly by the Safe

00:45:30.715 --> 00:45:34.257
Drinking Water Act and the
maximum contaminant level

00:45:34.257 --> 00:45:35.369
standards.
 

00:45:35.369 --> 00:45:42.250
So there is no requirement
under LEED to filter water,

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:47.039
despite the fact that many
water lines are capable of

00:45:47.039 --> 00:45:52.751
transmitting not just metals but
also some of the components of

00:45:52.751 --> 00:45:53.949
plastics.
 

00:45:53.949 --> 00:45:58.896
So that the core problem with
respect to managing chemicals in

00:45:58.896 --> 00:46:03.923
the indoor environment and the
ultimate life cycle of chemicals

00:46:03.923 --> 00:46:07.329
has to do with Congress's
inactivity,

00:46:07.329 --> 00:46:11.090
its failure to demand that
chemicals that are used in the

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:14.675
building industry be labeled,
that they be tested before

00:46:14.675 --> 00:46:15.449
they're used.
 

00:46:15.449 --> 00:46:19.820
So that it's creating a pattern
of exposure that really we don't

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.070
understand well.
 

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:24.050
We know we're being exposed to
a brand new mixture of

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.739
compounds.
 

00:46:24.739 --> 00:46:27.438
So what kinds of
recommendations might you think

00:46:27.438 --> 00:46:29.219
about to improve this system?
 

00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:34.539
Well one would be to simplify
the scoring system so that

00:46:34.539 --> 00:46:39.146
rather than using the platinum,
the gold standards,

00:46:39.146 --> 00:46:43.170
I would prefer to see a scale
that was simply a zero to one

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:47.052
hundred scale so that people
would not have the incentive

00:46:47.052 --> 00:46:51.422
just to get to eighty points so
that that would ensure that they

00:46:51.422 --> 00:46:54.960
would be awarded the platinum
certification.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.983
I think that the categories of
certification need to be

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:05.471
diversified so that if the Green
Building Council judged and

00:47:05.471 --> 00:47:10.960
scored a project's performance
in separate categories,

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.909
developers would have an
incentive to score higher in all

00:47:14.909 --> 00:47:16.250
those categories.
 

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.054
In other words,
set up a separate scoring

00:47:19.054 --> 00:47:23.190
system for indoor environmental
quality and human health.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.849
Set up a separate system for
energy efficiency.

00:47:25.849 --> 00:47:28.809
Set up a separate system for
water supply.

00:47:28.809 --> 00:47:32.882
But whether or not we want to
have this system managed by a

00:47:32.882 --> 00:47:37.027
nonprofit organization that is
run by the board of directors

00:47:37.027 --> 00:47:40.820
that have predominately
for-profit organizations,

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:43.099
that's another basic question.
 

00:47:43.099 --> 00:47:45.340
So should the federal
government take this over?

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:49.594
So this system is not designed
in its current form to encourage

00:47:49.594 --> 00:47:53.300
the use of safer chemicals in
the building industry.

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:58.664
So that what kinds of
innovations might encourage

00:47:58.664 --> 00:48:05.257
builders to want to buy building
products that contain safer

00:48:05.257 --> 00:48:06.710
products?
 

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:09.717
Well, they would certainly need
to know what the chemicals were

00:48:09.717 --> 00:48:12.675
in the products so that there's
a labeling issue that needs to

00:48:12.675 --> 00:48:13.550
be confronted.
 

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:16.030
But also, there's a testing
issue as well.

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:21.824
The Green Building Council also
has the opportunity not to

00:48:21.824 --> 00:48:27.619
disclose the results of its
building performance tests.

00:48:27.619 --> 00:48:34.018
So that the public really has
no opportunity to hold the Green

00:48:34.018 --> 00:48:40.521
Building Council accountable for
its declaration of performance

00:48:40.521 --> 00:48:43.460
in different categories.
 

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:47.855
So I think I'll close with the
thought that this is a very

00:48:47.855 --> 00:48:52.481
interesting historical example
of how certification standards

00:48:52.481 --> 00:48:56.260
evolved in a nonprofit
organization that really is

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.500
representing for-profit
industries,

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:03.840
the large building products
industry,

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.103
the major building companies,
large architectural firms and

00:49:07.103 --> 00:49:08.230
engineering firms.
 

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:11.445
And this program has no
accountability at all to the

00:49:11.445 --> 00:49:14.838
United States public,
at the same time that it's

00:49:14.838 --> 00:49:18.449
being built into law at all
levels of government.

00:49:18.449 --> 00:49:21.329
So something seems really very
much out of whack.

00:49:21.329 --> 00:49:26.070
And it demands I think a pretty
careful review.

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:30.197
One critical improvement could
be made if minimum performance

00:49:30.197 --> 00:49:34.117
criteria were set within each of
the specified categories:

00:49:34.117 --> 00:49:38.626
sustainable sites,
energy, the category for indoor

00:49:38.626 --> 00:49:40.800
environmental quality.
 

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:44.728
So that if there were minimum
and protective standards set

00:49:44.728 --> 00:49:47.923
inside those categories,
it would go a long way to

00:49:47.923 --> 00:49:50.380
meeting some of the objections I
just raised.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.739
Okay.
 

00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:52.610
Thank you very much.
 

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:54.889
We'll come back to larger
questions of community design on

00:49:54.889 --> 00:49:55.329
Thursday.
 

00:49:55.329 --> 00:50:02.000

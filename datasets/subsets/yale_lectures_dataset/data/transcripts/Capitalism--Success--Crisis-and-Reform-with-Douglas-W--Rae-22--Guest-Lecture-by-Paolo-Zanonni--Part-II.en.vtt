00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.510
Prof: Okay, let's begin.
 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:11.830
We continue Monday's look at
Goldman Sachs and Goldman Sachs'

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.320
role in the world of financial
capitalism,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.077
and as on Monday,
we have my good friend Paolo

00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:25.380
Zanonni with us.
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.385
He remarked after Monday's
class that he didn't get a

00:00:30.385 --> 00:00:33.850
single nasty question or
gesture,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.196
or anything of that nature
here, and then he spoke to his

00:00:40.196 --> 00:00:45.303
chairman Lloyd Blankfein,
who has been going around Ivy

00:00:45.303 --> 00:00:49.720
schools talking lately,
and Blankfein reported no

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.460
hostile response at Columbia
or--

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.060
where else did he go?
 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:06.540
Paolo Zanonni:
 Columbia and Princeton.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.510
Prof: Let's try an
anonymous poll here.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.879
We'll use the technology of
humming,

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:19.869
and what I'd like you to do is
if you think that a great many

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.759
people who are in responsible
positions at Goldman Sachs and

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.549
similar banks make more money
than they really should.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.370
Paolo Zanonni:
 Don't be shy.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.519
Prof: And those who
don't think so?

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:47.300
I read that as 65/35 in the
affirmative.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.982
At any rate the--what we're
going to do today is begin with

00:01:53.982 --> 00:02:01.125
an informal discussion looking
at some of Paolo's work over the

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:05.701
years at Goldman,
whereas, last time we focused

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:09.000
within the firm,
today we're going to focus on

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.008
the firm as an actor in the
larger world,

00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:19.210
and Paolo is going to be--going
to respond to a few questions

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.568
about other endeavors and then
he is going to take the

00:02:25.568 --> 00:02:32.770
microphone and lecture on the
case of the huge Spanish energy

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.050
company and battle for control
of it,

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.599
and you'll see when he does
that that the activities of an

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.760
investment banker are pretty
challenging and extremely

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.930
complex.
 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.366
But we'll continue with--well
let's start with--do any of you

00:02:57.366 --> 00:03:02.819
own any garments from Dolce
&amp; Gabbana?

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.930
Does anybody know what it is?
 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:18.120
What, pray tell?
 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.889
Student:  They're a
designer.

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.270
Prof: Okay,
they're a designer.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.008
Do they just draw things or do
they--they sell things.

00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:25.900
Student:  Make and sell
as well.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.120
Prof: Okay.
 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.009
Are they for the value
conscious shopper?

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.720
Student:  No.
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.303
Prof: No,
they are the inverse of

00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:39.160
Wal-Mart.
 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.560
Who's higher on the price
schedule than them Paolo,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.240
anybody?
 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.116
Paolo Zanonni:
 Hermes,

00:03:44.116 --> 00:03:44.479
I believe.
 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.690
Prof: Hermes may be
higher, but it's a luxury goods

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.639
company,
and Paolo who dresses well,

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:56.006
but so far as I can tell,
doesn't care a bit about luxury

00:03:56.006 --> 00:04:00.688
goods,
is its chairman.

00:04:00.688 --> 00:04:03.128
Tell us about,
just in a few minutes,

00:04:03.128 --> 00:04:07.799
about what the object of your
role there is and how it relates

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.008
to the CEO and the strategic
challenges that come in.

00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:15.826
Paolo Zanonni:
 My role is--the company

00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:20.492
Dolce &amp; Gabbana is about
twenty-three or twenty-four

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:21.680
years old.
 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.589
It was started by the two
designers and by the CEO.

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:35.259
It has grown at a rate of about
20% to 25% per year.

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:42.339
Right before the credit crunch
was--

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:45.839
when the multiples were about,
let's say,

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:52.543
thirteen to fourteen times
EBITDA, the company was more or

00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:57.129
less worth about $6 billion
dollars,

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:02.495
but the culture of the company
has remained like the small

00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:06.259
company the two designers
started it,

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.422
and so the reason why--we
developed a friendship out of

00:05:12.422 --> 00:05:13.449
chance.
 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.709
They have an excellent CEO.
 

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:21.009
I believe it's probably--in a
country where ladies CEOs are

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.197
rather unusual,
but I think she might be the

00:05:24.197 --> 00:05:27.089
only one of a company of that
size.

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:31.012
She's really formidable,
one of the best CEOs I have

00:05:31.012 --> 00:05:35.242
met, and so we developed a
friendship with her first and

00:05:35.242 --> 00:05:38.089
with the two designers
afterward.

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:41.930
At one point they thought that
the main challenge of the

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.980
company was to become more
institutionalized because if you

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.108
look--
especially if you look at

00:05:48.108 --> 00:05:50.855
luxury good companies,
few of them are

00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:52.600
institutionalized.
 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.516
Because for instance just to
take a few, Armani is not,

00:05:58.516 --> 00:06:03.230
Prada is not,
Dolce &amp; Gabbana is not.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.069
Gucci is institutionalized.
 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:08.980
Prof: Help us--make sure
we understand what's meant by

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.949
institutionalized.
 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.088
Paolo Zanonni:
 Institutionalized I mean

00:06:14.088 --> 00:06:18.708
companies where,
let's say, the corporate

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:26.555
functions are very small,
and company's where you have

00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:32.923
culture and processes,
and personalities,

00:06:32.923 --> 00:06:39.579
and recruitment policies,
and leadership selection

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:47.425
policies that are likely to make
the company successful over the

00:06:47.425 --> 00:06:51.274
long period,
regardless of the influence and

00:06:51.274 --> 00:06:53.009
the survival of the founder.
 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:54.829
Prof: So the firm,
its strategies,

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:59.211
and the job structure,
the structure of employment

00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:03.951
responsibilities becomes
permanent enough to transcend

00:07:03.951 --> 00:07:06.009
the founding group?
 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.745
Paolo Zanonni:
 Yes and usually the best

00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:09.745
way--
the best way,

00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:14.689
one of the effective ways to do
it,

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:18.279
so we'll go back to Monday,
one of the effective ways to do

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:21.500
it is to turn it into a public
liability company,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.589
and have showed us,
and have the discipline,

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:29.860
and the function of the public
market imposes on you.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.841
Thus, the entrepreneurs
sometimes don't like to do it

00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:38.088
and so it's--
to try to institutionalize the

00:07:38.088 --> 00:07:42.526
company in that way,
without turning to the public

00:07:42.526 --> 00:07:44.928
market,
which is something that the two

00:07:44.928 --> 00:07:50.610
owners--
they own 90% of the company.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.690
The remaining 10% is owned by a
few of the senior management.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.269
The company is a strange
company.

00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:02.838
Since they don't want to access
the public market,

00:08:02.838 --> 00:08:06.569
institutionalize a company with
so--

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:10.829
such strong personalities
involved not only in designing

00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:16.019
of the goods but in the everyday
life of the company is not easy.

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:19.430
They say that I could--that I
could be helpful.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.339
So far we haven't done very
much, but--anyways it's a lot of

00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:24.839
fun.
 

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:26.769
I have to tell you it's a lot
of fun.

00:08:26.769 --> 00:08:32.051
Prof: Another industrial
sector that you have very

00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:36.389
substantial experience with is
cars, with Ford,

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:39.690
Fiat, Volvo and General Motors.
 

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.860
Have I got that right?
 

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.120
Paolo Zanonni:  Yeah.
 

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.259
Prof: Did I miss
something?

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:44.389
Paolo Zanonni:  No.
 

00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:48.049
I have less--unless you want to
talk about trucks.

00:08:48.049 --> 00:08:50.381
Prof: Well--
Paolo Zanonni:

00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:52.389
 The two sectors are
different,

00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:57.269
but you have trucks in--for
people who used to have trucks,

00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:59.639
there's a fair number of truck
companies.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:04.384
Prof: I actually thought
your experience with helping to

00:09:04.384 --> 00:09:07.600
bring General Motors and Fiat
together,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.807
and then helping them to
separate themselves was very

00:09:12.807 --> 00:09:17.222
interesting,
and your views about the sort

00:09:17.222 --> 00:09:21.553
of informal compact that seemed,
at that time,

00:09:21.553 --> 00:09:24.370
to regulate the Detroit car
companies,

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:30.062
and which probably wasn't a
great influence on the

00:09:30.062 --> 00:09:35.784
survivability of General Motors,
seemed like a very interesting

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:38.820
topic if you could give us some
a few minutes on that.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.269
Paolo Zanonni:  Okay.
 

00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:50.320
One of the peculiarities of the
car industry worldwide,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.240
definitely the car industry in
Europe,

00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:02.126
is that it's one of the few
industries that has been plagued

00:10:02.126 --> 00:10:09.480
by over capacity for at least
the last thirty years,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.511
and one of the few industries
in which this over capacity have

00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:19.269
never been taken out of the
system,

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:24.635
but in which the players
have--at least until last year

00:10:24.635 --> 00:10:27.320
it was easier to survive.
 

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.899
This is a very peculiar
situation,

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:35.691
because if you look at most
private industries in which

00:10:35.691 --> 00:10:40.840
there is a large degree of
private ownership,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.940
and more or less,
the rules of capitalism apply,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:50.365
at least to a large extent,
you really seldom have such a

00:10:50.365 --> 00:10:56.860
high degree of over capacity and
the survival of all the players.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.230
Not only--but I'm not up to
date so--

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.719
but let's say that up to five
years ago or six years ago when

00:11:04.719 --> 00:11:09.178
I used to be up to date,
capacity had been not taken off

00:11:09.178 --> 00:11:11.230
the system but added.
 

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.841
There is--we will have to
search long and hard to find

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:20.158
situations,
in which productive facilities

00:11:20.158 --> 00:11:24.488
have been shut down,
and on the contrary,

00:11:24.488 --> 00:11:30.662
we find a lot of instances in
which new productive facilities

00:11:30.662 --> 00:11:35.288
have been built,
but none has been shut down.

00:11:35.288 --> 00:11:37.899
Actually you could argue with
that number;

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:44.898
that you could argue that
actually the over capacity has

00:11:44.898 --> 00:11:46.678
grown worse.
 

00:11:46.678 --> 00:11:50.405
Players--the players have
been--I mean they are not stupid

00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:52.672
people,
they are conscious of the fact

00:11:52.672 --> 00:11:55.360
that they're operating in the
industry which is,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.636
or which was,
but I think still is plagued by

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:04.418
over capacity,
and so except for drastic

00:12:04.418 --> 00:12:11.048
reduction in capacity start
closing down factories,

00:12:11.048 --> 00:12:14.961
they have been trying to
address this situation in every

00:12:14.961 --> 00:12:16.028
possible way.
 

00:12:16.028 --> 00:12:21.754
One the ways--one of the most
traditional ways that have been

00:12:21.754 --> 00:12:27.576
used has been different types of
joint ventures and/or mergers

00:12:27.576 --> 00:12:29.580
and acquisitions.
 

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:36.926
One of the actions that was
supposed to change the face of

00:12:36.926 --> 00:12:45.044
the industry was the acquisition
of Chrysler by Daimler-Benz but

00:12:45.044 --> 00:12:52.158
I think that they--
the absorption didn't work well.

00:12:52.158 --> 00:12:55.307
Daimler lost a lot of money,
and afterward,

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:58.678
Chrysler was sold to a private
equity firm.

00:12:58.678 --> 00:13:03.695
The only case that I know of,
of a reasonably large car

00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:07.596
company being shut down,
is the old British

00:13:07.596 --> 00:13:10.288
&gt;
 

00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:13.721
that was sold to a private
equity firm and

00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:16.149
Dr&gt;
 

00:13:16.149 --> 00:13:22.428
The brand was sold to a Chinese
producer that wanted to have a

00:13:22.428 --> 00:13:24.178
European brand.
 

00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:29.014
Prof: Without getting
down to details--well broad

00:13:29.014 --> 00:13:33.500
details but the compact that
seemed to operate--

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.125
Prof: --between
management and labor have

00:13:37.125 --> 00:13:38.361
adequate--
Paolo Zanonni:

00:13:38.361 --> 00:13:38.649
 And government.
 

00:13:38.649 --> 00:13:40.788
Prof: About the
management of another.

00:13:40.788 --> 00:13:41.860
Paolo Zanonni:
 The government.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.614
Prof: And the
government--spell that out a

00:13:44.614 --> 00:13:45.360
little bit.
 

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.825
Paolo Zanonni:
 It was--it's different in

00:13:48.825 --> 00:13:50.298
different nations.
 

00:13:50.298 --> 00:13:56.427
Let's say that--let's be
general, which is my impression

00:13:56.427 --> 00:14:03.000
in working for them was that
there were little incentives in

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.682
vigorously addressing the
situation with the kind of

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:13.139
action that you would be
needing,

00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:17.340
and that was because,
let's take for instance,

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:24.370
let's take an adversary view of
a relationship in the workplace,

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.921
let's suppose the management
would have liked to close down

00:14:28.921 --> 00:14:30.019
one factory.
 

00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:35.990
The degree of unionization,
the degree of--

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.323
in the whole company,
the degree of a relationship in

00:14:39.323 --> 00:14:43.107
countries different from the
United States between the union

00:14:43.107 --> 00:14:47.403
and political parties,
the degree of influence of the

00:14:47.403 --> 00:14:52.249
union's own government,
and in addition the degree to

00:14:52.249 --> 00:14:56.921
which the life of the company
itself depends on the

00:14:56.921 --> 00:14:58.230
government.
 

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:04.003
You have seen an example in the
last credit crunch in which the

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:09.870
purchase of new cars is in fact
subsidized by the government.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.230
This is new in the states,
but it's not new in Europe,

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.945
it's--as far as I'm concerned
this is the third one that I've

00:15:15.945 --> 00:15:18.350
seen in Europe,
it's not the first one.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:25.600
You have this very strange
situation in which management,

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.850
the union, and the government
become,

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.134
to some extent,
dependent on each other and the

00:15:33.134 --> 00:15:37.700
last thing they want is to upset
this balance,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.702
and the result,
no extra capacity is taken off

00:15:41.702 --> 00:15:42.860
the system.
 

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.240
No serious restructuring is
being done.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.365
Prof: So the--
Paolo Zanonni:

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:50.519
 Now it is,
now it is;

00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:53.039
now probably it is with the use
of Chapter 11.

00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:54.038
Prof: Yes.
 

00:15:54.038 --> 00:15:57.009
Paolo Zanonni:
 It's a huge--with a huge

00:15:57.009 --> 00:16:00.368
financial crisis and the use of
Chapter 11, which has

00:16:00.368 --> 00:16:03.210
allowed--I'll tell you a
personal story.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.971
I worked for Fiat,
as a manager,

00:16:05.971 --> 00:16:11.135
for about fifteen years and I
worked with Goldman for about

00:16:11.135 --> 00:16:12.740
fifteen years.
 

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.178
In sum--fourteen and fifteen
years in sum--

00:16:16.178 --> 00:16:20.316
if there is one deal that I
tried to do three times has been

00:16:20.316 --> 00:16:26.210
Fiat's acquisition of Chrysler,
and I failed three times.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:27.360
Prof: Aren't you lucky?
 

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:27.830
Paolo Zanonni:  No.
 

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.596
I think it was one of the deals
that make more sense in the

00:16:31.596 --> 00:16:35.171
industry, and this time,
Fiat management was successful,

00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:37.120
but why it was successful?
 

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:42.106
It was successful because
Chrysler was not sold by the

00:16:42.106 --> 00:16:45.467
owner;
it was practically given to

00:16:45.467 --> 00:16:51.168
them by the Federal government
in exchange for an industrial

00:16:51.168 --> 00:16:54.840
product, and practically debt
free.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.984
As you can see,
the industry is changing,

00:16:57.984 --> 00:17:02.778
but again it's changing because
one--because of Chapter 11 and

00:17:02.778 --> 00:17:06.630
because of the size of this
financial crisis.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.057
The compact between the three
players has broken down,

00:17:10.057 --> 00:17:11.480
totally broken down.
 

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.148
Prof: Well and--
Paolo Zanonni:

00:17:13.148 --> 00:17:14.170
 Same thing with General
Motors.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:18.404
Prof: The car industry
preserving these legacy firms

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:22.275
runs against the tide of
creative destruction that you

00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:25.049
expect in capitalist
industries--

00:17:25.049 --> 00:17:26.318
Paolo Zanonni:  Totally.
 

00:17:26.318 --> 00:17:30.747
Prof: --and that's
highlighted by the fact that you

00:17:30.747 --> 00:17:35.329
go back to the beginning of the
twentieth century there were

00:17:35.329 --> 00:17:39.680
1,200 firms making automobiles
in the United States.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.277
There obviously had to be a
meltdown there because it's an

00:17:43.277 --> 00:17:46.369
industry with huge scale
economies that encourages

00:17:46.369 --> 00:17:47.568
centralization.
 

00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:48.858
Paolo Zanonni:
 Yeah but tell who is--

00:17:48.858 --> 00:17:53.897
tell me who in the United
States or in France has

00:17:53.897 --> 00:17:59.880
restructured or changed the
landscape in car making in the

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.190
last twenty years?
 

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.181
With the exception of some
Europeans and some Japanese that

00:18:05.181 --> 00:18:07.088
have started productive
procedures.

00:18:07.088 --> 00:18:11.828
Prof: The Japanese and
Koreans are enforcing some

00:18:11.828 --> 00:18:13.380
changes I think.
 

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:20.276
At any rate let's--I'm going to
get offstage and let Paolo talk

00:18:20.276 --> 00:18:26.281
about an extremely complex and
interesting cross border

00:18:26.281 --> 00:18:32.288
transaction which centers on
Spain but involves several

00:18:32.288 --> 00:18:35.960
European countries at once.
 

00:18:35.960 --> 00:19:14.690
 
 

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:20.844
Paolo Zanonni:
 Let me try to look at one

00:19:20.844 --> 00:19:28.568
case, which is actually--let's
take it one step backward.

00:19:28.568 --> 00:19:33.518
The case I would like to
discuss is the attempt by the

00:19:33.518 --> 00:19:37.720
new management of a large
utility company,

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:43.182
Enel, which is only electrical,
but not the only electrical

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:49.215
utility company in Italy,
to change the structure and the

00:19:49.215 --> 00:19:53.598
characteristic of the company
totally,

00:19:53.598 --> 00:19:59.492
and the attempt by the
management over a period of six

00:19:59.492 --> 00:20:06.387
or seven years to turn a major
utility company depending mostly

00:20:06.387 --> 00:20:12.479
on one single nation,
into a different company that

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:19.430
will diminish the risk by being
present into several nations,

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:24.328
but at the same time,
that will totally change the

00:20:24.328 --> 00:20:27.630
characteristic of that company.
 

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.740
Let me try to explain.
 

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:35.627
If you take a utility,
usually utility has very little

00:20:35.627 --> 00:20:40.740
risk because it lives in a
regulated sector.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:46.220
It makes--it has an agreement
with a regulator that the

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:52.063
utility will may--
would make certain level of

00:20:52.063 --> 00:20:57.656
capital investment,
and in exchange,

00:20:57.656 --> 00:21:06.358
will be able to impose on the
customer some tariffs.

00:21:06.358 --> 00:21:11.615
If you can imagine,
utilities would be a very,

00:21:11.615 --> 00:21:16.637
very safe investment for the
small investor,

00:21:16.637 --> 00:21:20.608
it would be similar to a bond.
 

00:21:20.608 --> 00:21:24.394
You have to do capital
investment, because capital

00:21:24.394 --> 00:21:28.410
investments are a reward through
a tariff system,

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.520
and if you invest in the
company it's like investing in a

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:31.910
bond.
 

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:35.921
If you look at utilities,
have small capital

00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:39.558
appreciation,
and pay high dividends.

00:21:39.558 --> 00:21:43.105
The new management of Enel,
when Enel was sort of

00:21:43.105 --> 00:21:46.650
privatized,
decided that they were trying

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:51.929
to change that completely and
tried to make the boring utility

00:21:51.929 --> 00:21:56.690
into a company that was going to
offer more growth,

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:04.900
more risk, less dividend,
and more capital appreciation.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.670
When you try to do that
to--with a giant--

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.665
that at the time that they
decided to do it I think that

00:22:11.665 --> 00:22:13.900
Enel was worth about 40 billion
Euros,

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.619
which would make it $60 billion
dollars at today's exchange

00:22:17.619 --> 00:22:18.069
rate.
 

00:22:18.069 --> 00:22:22.618
It's a major task.
 

00:22:22.618 --> 00:22:30.142
The way the management decided
to do it was through changing

00:22:30.142 --> 00:22:36.900
the product mix and getting into
renewable energy,

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:43.259
but also in trying to start the
policy of aggressive

00:22:43.259 --> 00:22:48.890
diversification,
moving into other countries.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.990
First they moved into Eastern
Europe,

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:59.344
to some extent and Russia,
but one thing that you learn

00:22:59.344 --> 00:23:06.640
when you take the helm of a $60
billion dollar corporation,

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:13.190
is that if you try to change
the characteristic of the

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:19.000
company by a set of small size
acquisitions,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.106
you run out of time,
because if you are a

00:23:22.106 --> 00:23:25.901
professional--
if you have a professional

00:23:25.901 --> 00:23:30.960
management team executing--
execute, making and executing a

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.138
small deal,
it takes as much time and

00:23:34.138 --> 00:23:37.318
effort in as executing a huge
one,

00:23:37.318 --> 00:23:42.348
and so what is different is the
amount of risk.

00:23:42.348 --> 00:23:48.973
So the management of Enel
starts looking around at one

00:23:48.973 --> 00:23:56.598
single move that would have
changed the company completely.

00:23:56.598 --> 00:24:02.650
One of the areas in the nations
where they looked at was Spain.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.940
Why it was Spain?
 

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:12.824
First, Spain has a first
rate--as generally has a first

00:24:12.824 --> 00:24:19.698
rate public elite,
it's usually--I would say it's

00:24:19.698 --> 00:24:25.028
a country where their regulatory
system,

00:24:25.028 --> 00:24:29.818
especially for utilities,
it's very good,

00:24:29.818 --> 00:24:33.950
it's very stable,
it's well regulated,

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:42.598
there is a centuries old
structure of tariff--

00:24:42.598 --> 00:24:45.410
regulation and tariff behavior
that is very good,

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.538
and this has created as you can
see,

00:24:48.538 --> 00:24:52.440
in a country that is really
small or reasonably small,

00:24:52.440 --> 00:25:01.306
the presence of at least five
or six utilities that are of a

00:25:01.306 --> 00:25:03.410
decent size.
 

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:10.083
So there was--there is room for
consolidation in America that is

00:25:10.083 --> 00:25:15.380
very attractive from the
economic point of view.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:22.431
Obviously Spain was one of the
first nations where the Enel

00:25:22.431 --> 00:25:27.767
management looked at,
moreover as you can see,

00:25:27.767 --> 00:25:33.911
it's true there are six players
but when you go to electricity

00:25:33.911 --> 00:25:39.349
you only have two players that
are very important,

00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:43.029
Endesa and Iberdrola.
 

00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:51.096
So Enel--the management of Enel
paid very close attention to the

00:25:51.096 --> 00:25:57.884
development in the Spanish
market and to opportunities

00:25:57.884 --> 00:26:02.750
opening up in the Spanish
markets.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:07.190
What happened at one point was
that--

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.090
I don't know how familiar you
are with Spanish as a political

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:15.575
economic system,
so let me step back for one

00:26:15.575 --> 00:26:21.009
second and give you a few--
you can ask questions.

00:26:21.009 --> 00:26:23.571
By the way, you can interrupt
and ask questions any time you

00:26:23.571 --> 00:26:24.508
want,
because if not,

00:26:24.508 --> 00:26:29.152
this gets very boring,
because it's very confusing

00:26:29.152 --> 00:26:31.618
possibly as well.
 

00:26:31.618 --> 00:26:37.477
A Spanish political economic
system from the political point

00:26:37.477 --> 00:26:42.988
of view,
it's a very stable democracy,

00:26:42.988 --> 00:26:49.538
where you tend to have two
large parties,

00:26:49.538 --> 00:26:53.500
that usually occupy the
government for some--

00:26:53.500 --> 00:27:00.319
for a reasonable amount--for a
reasonably long time and change

00:27:00.319 --> 00:27:02.681
orderly,
and there's the division

00:27:02.681 --> 00:27:03.858
between the two parties.
 

00:27:03.858 --> 00:27:08.558
One is a conservative parties
linked with,

00:27:08.558 --> 00:27:13.436
to some extent,
linked with the old Catholic

00:27:13.436 --> 00:27:19.311
heritage of Spain,
and the other is a democratic

00:27:19.311 --> 00:27:23.178
socialist party,
more or less linked with the

00:27:23.178 --> 00:27:26.930
socialist heritages of Spain,
which is also significant.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:31.111
I don't know how many of you
are--well I suppose most of you

00:27:31.111 --> 00:27:35.009
are familiar with the Spanish
Civil War of 1975-1977.

00:27:35.009 --> 00:27:41.864
At the same time these two
parties live in a culture where

00:27:41.864 --> 00:27:47.996
regional differences and
regional cleavages are very

00:27:47.996 --> 00:27:49.680
important.
 

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.673
These are the main
characteristic of the Spain--of

00:27:52.673 --> 00:27:55.952
the political system;
we'll come to the economic

00:27:55.952 --> 00:27:59.262
system in a while,
so two large groups strongly

00:27:59.262 --> 00:28:03.440
identified with the two main
traditions in the country.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:10.150
One is socialist and the other
is Catholic and having--

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:14.712
also living in a situation in
which you have a high degree of

00:28:14.712 --> 00:28:18.058
differentiation between
different regions.

00:28:18.058 --> 00:28:22.190
Everybody knows about the
Basque areas,

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.397
but at the same time,
you're also to consider that

00:28:25.397 --> 00:28:28.411
Catalonia,
the area where Barcelona is,

00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:32.368
had been striving for autonomy,
if not independence,

00:28:32.368 --> 00:28:33.920
for a very long time.
 

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.761
These are the characteristics
of the political economic

00:28:35.761 --> 00:28:36.068
system.
 

00:28:36.068 --> 00:28:40.452
As far as the model of
development that Spain has

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:43.021
followed,
especially in the last twenty

00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:47.057
to twenty-five years,
is a model of development that

00:28:47.057 --> 00:28:52.029
is largely biased toward
construction and real estate

00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:57.608
development,
and so-and very entrepreneurial.

00:28:57.608 --> 00:29:03.132
So you have--you have
especially in the late 1990s and

00:29:03.132 --> 00:29:08.250
in the early 2000,
the creation of a lot of very

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:12.623
entrepreneurial,
very aggressive,

00:29:12.623 --> 00:29:19.442
very wealthy companies that--
which line of business were

00:29:19.442 --> 00:29:22.230
mostly construction and real
estate.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.150
The entrepreneurs in these
companies--

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:28.528
you say what does that have to
do with utilities,

00:29:28.528 --> 00:29:32.348
and what does it have to do
with the opportunities open to

00:29:32.348 --> 00:29:35.029
Enel to enter into the Spanish
market?

00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:40.471
It has to do--as you can see,
one of the diversification

00:29:40.471 --> 00:29:45.616
policies used by these
entrepreneurial companies that

00:29:45.616 --> 00:29:51.750
have made most of the money on
real estate and construction was

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:56.599
to buy stakes into large utility
companies.

00:29:56.599 --> 00:29:58.890
Why?
 

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.170
It's a good diversification
policy.

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:06.960
It pays stable dividends,
as we saw at the beginning,

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.143
and plus you enter into an
industrial sector that is

00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:14.636
fractionalized,
and so assuming that there is

00:30:14.636 --> 00:30:16.558
consolidation,
&gt;

00:30:16.558 --> 00:30:19.327
or seven players,
you are likely to be paid a

00:30:19.327 --> 00:30:21.778
premium for the shares that you
have.

00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:24.200
So what I tried to do there is
very complex,

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.220
and so you have to excuse me
and you have to ask questions,

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.806
is that--this is different from
the utility sector in any

00:30:31.806 --> 00:30:35.578
country that I have--
that I know of.

00:30:35.578 --> 00:30:40.411
You have large,
or you had, large construction

00:30:40.411 --> 00:30:46.529
companies as minority but
significant shareholders in many

00:30:46.529 --> 00:30:50.608
of the utility companies in
Spain.

00:30:50.608 --> 00:30:53.848
They are there for two
reasons--for three reasons;

00:30:53.848 --> 00:30:59.090
diversification of risk because
you are in a very stable

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:05.190
business, totally different from
construction and real estate.

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.542
You get high dividends for the
stake that you have bought,

00:31:08.542 --> 00:31:11.250
and so you get a good yield on
your capital.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.895
Third, there is likely to be
consolidation and so you are

00:31:14.895 --> 00:31:19.130
likely to be paid a premium for
the shares that you purchased,

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.900
so a very nice position to be
in.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:28.344
But look at this for a second,
in every company in which there

00:31:28.344 --> 00:31:30.348
is--
for the same reason that I

00:31:30.348 --> 00:31:33.712
tried to tell you,
every utility company where

00:31:33.712 --> 00:31:37.684
there is one of these
construction companies as a

00:31:37.684 --> 00:31:42.650
shareholder does not have a very
solid shareholder base,

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:46.778
because one of the main
shareholders is there not

00:31:46.778 --> 00:31:52.368
because of commitment to that
particular industry or anything,

00:31:52.368 --> 00:31:56.645
but just for having built while
it lasts and for selling the

00:31:56.645 --> 00:32:00.269
shares at a premium when there
is consolidation.

00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:03.637
If you look from the point of
view of someone that wants to

00:32:03.637 --> 00:32:08.251
enter the market,
you have very attractive market

00:32:08.251 --> 00:32:14.490
because the regulatory regime is
very good and you have a

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:20.950
situation of not totally stable
shareholder base in each of

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.288
these countries.
 

00:32:23.288 --> 00:32:28.988
As everybody expected,
at the end of 2005,

00:32:28.988 --> 00:32:36.633
the fact that the structure of
the industry had too many

00:32:36.633 --> 00:32:41.220
players, it started changing.
 

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:45.240
One of the companies,
Gas Natural,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:50.358
decided to launch an hostile
bid on Endesa,

00:32:50.358 --> 00:32:53.650
counting on two things.
 

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:57.005
Counting on the fact that
Endesa, where the shareholder

00:32:57.005 --> 00:33:00.933
would have been the seller,
for the same reason that I gave

00:33:00.933 --> 00:33:04.384
you before,
and on the fact that where

00:33:04.384 --> 00:33:10.548
synergies and economies of scale
and scope that could have been

00:33:10.548 --> 00:33:16.316
achieved or implemented by
putting together Gas Natural and

00:33:16.316 --> 00:33:17.509
Endesa.
 

00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:22.361
They launched the hostile bid,
but something that they didn't

00:33:22.361 --> 00:33:29.663
count on happened immediately,
which is that the reactions to

00:33:29.663 --> 00:33:37.078
that bid was not very friendly
by two entities;

00:33:37.078 --> 00:33:42.102
the regulators,
as you can see the C&amp;E,

00:33:42.102 --> 00:33:45.568
and the Spanish government.
 

00:33:45.568 --> 00:33:52.480
Why was not the Spanish
government reaction favorable?

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.277
First, you have a deal that
makes perfect sense from the

00:33:57.277 --> 00:34:00.680
economic and financial point of
view.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.821
The shareholders of Endesa are
happy because they get paid a

00:34:04.821 --> 00:34:10.023
decent premium on their stock,
the company remains Spanish,

00:34:10.023 --> 00:34:13.940
synergies are going to be
extracted,

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.431
there is not a lot of
overlapping and so there are not

00:34:17.431 --> 00:34:21.489
going to be a lot of layoffs,
the ensuing company will be

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:24.188
very strong,
will definitely be a national

00:34:24.188 --> 00:34:26.820
champion,
probably a European champion;

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.679
so why doesn't the government
like it?

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:42.242
It happens to be that Endesa is
Madrid based and Gas Natural is

00:34:42.242 --> 00:34:46.159
based on Barcelona.
 

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:51.833
It also happens to be that at
the same time there is a big

00:34:51.833 --> 00:34:57.407
fight in the political arena
between the government party

00:34:57.407 --> 00:35:01.501
socialist,
and the opposition party,

00:35:01.501 --> 00:35:08.057
the conservative and one of the
issues that they are fighting on

00:35:08.057 --> 00:35:13.989
is decentralization of power
within different regions.

00:35:13.989 --> 00:35:19.385
It also happens that while a
large part of the power base of

00:35:19.385 --> 00:35:22.679
the socialist party is in
Madrid,

00:35:22.679 --> 00:35:28.014
a reasonably large base of the
power of the conservative party

00:35:28.014 --> 00:35:29.590
is in Barcelona.
 

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:34.000
So oddly enough,
or naturally enough,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:42.132
the ruling socialist party sees
the attempt by a gas company

00:35:42.132 --> 00:35:48.199
from Barcelona to try to buy the
biggest,

00:35:48.199 --> 00:35:51.949
or one of, the second biggest,
depends on how you count,

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:56.876
utility company based in
Madrid, as almost a political

00:35:56.876 --> 00:36:00.409
move instead of an industrial
move,

00:36:00.409 --> 00:36:02.329
and they just don't like it.
 

00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:04.994
And so they tried to stop it,
as you can see from the

00:36:04.994 --> 00:36:08.478
statement,
they tried to stop it making it

00:36:08.478 --> 00:36:13.751
difficult so the regulatory
agency and just trying to fight

00:36:13.751 --> 00:36:17.570
it with all the weapons that
they have.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:22.731
Enel, the Italian utility
company, has not been the only

00:36:22.731 --> 00:36:26.110
one looking at the Spanish
market.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:30.295
If the Spanish is that
attractive, as I tried to

00:36:30.295 --> 00:36:34.840
describe it to you that means
that someone else--

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.829
a few other people have been
looking for opportunities to

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:43.320
enter the Spanish market and get
hold of one of those prizes.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:50.141
One of the companies that's
been looking for that is the

00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:53.489
German giant called E.On.
 

00:36:53.489 --> 00:36:56.197
E.On is an exceedingly
sophisticated company,

00:36:56.197 --> 00:36:57.059
exceedingly.
 

00:36:57.059 --> 00:37:00.045
They are sophisticated,
they have been a leading

00:37:00.045 --> 00:37:04.389
utility for so many years,
they know all the complexities

00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:09.139
of operating in a regulated
sector where you depend on the

00:37:09.139 --> 00:37:12.389
investment you make in the
tariffs,

00:37:12.389 --> 00:37:16.733
so they are very sophisticated
in understanding the political

00:37:16.733 --> 00:37:19.340
environment in which you
operate,

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:24.268
and which heavily influences
your outcome and your choices.

00:37:24.268 --> 00:37:27.568
They see an opening,
they say wait a second,

00:37:27.568 --> 00:37:31.710
and the government doesn't like
the Gas Natural bid.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.539
Gas Natural doesn't have a lot
of cash,

00:37:34.539 --> 00:37:37.889
so it will be difficult for
them to raise--

00:37:37.889 --> 00:37:40.489
it would be difficult for them
to raise the bid,

00:37:40.489 --> 00:37:44.682
at the same time,
they don't seem to have

00:37:44.682 --> 00:37:46.780
political support.
 

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:52.702
So maybe here there is a space
for a foreign bidder that will

00:37:52.702 --> 00:37:58.824
table for the shareholders a bid
that is higher than the bid of

00:37:58.824 --> 00:38:01.489
Gas Natural for Endesa.
 

00:38:01.489 --> 00:38:06.130
Gutsy move, because if you look
at hostile bid,

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:10.670
cross border in Europe,
in a regulated sector,

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:14.099
I think this is the first one.
 

00:38:14.099 --> 00:38:19.378
Very gutsy move,
very well structured,

00:38:19.378 --> 00:38:24.230
very well done,
very well timed.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.972
E.On moves, and,
as you noticed,

00:38:26.972 --> 00:38:31.929
the bid is significantly higher
than the previous one;

00:38:31.929 --> 00:38:38.489
€27 instead of €21.
 

00:38:38.489 --> 00:38:44.876
In a very sophisticated way,
which is worse if the company

00:38:44.876 --> 00:38:50.280
that E.On is,
they also start a sophisticated

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:56.572
lobby with the European
Commission because they believe

00:38:56.572 --> 00:39:02.139
that the main threat;
it is not another bidder.

00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:06.989
The main threat is the Spanish
Government doesn't want a German

00:39:06.989 --> 00:39:10.510
utility own the leading champion
in Madrid.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:13.251
There's no reason why,
if they didn't like Barcelona

00:39:13.251 --> 00:39:15.407
to own it,
why shouldn't like--I don't

00:39:15.407 --> 00:39:17.947
remember what year it's based,
it's based in the

00:39:17.947 --> 00:39:19.460
&gt;
 

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.150
somewhere, but I don't
remember, I think it's near

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:26.498
Frankfurt, but--
Student:  It's

00:39:26.498 --> 00:39:26.800
Dusseldorf.
 

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.628
Paolo Zanonni:
 Dusseldorf,

00:39:28.628 --> 00:39:30.570
sorry, you are right I was
wrong.

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:35.672
E.On starts lobbying the
European Commission and hopes to

00:39:35.672 --> 00:39:39.590
have an opening by the German
regulators.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:44.659
An opening, really no bigger
position comes,

00:39:44.659 --> 00:39:51.853
but an opening really doesn't
come, and the Spanish government

00:39:51.853 --> 00:39:54.920
stalls, so rightly so.
 

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.695
E.On looks at the ownership
structure of Endesa and sees

00:39:59.695 --> 00:40:02.650
that there are a lot of sellers.
 

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:06.570
It says, "Okay this is
going to be a financial fight,

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:13.889
let me just up the ante,
I raise my bid to €34 per

00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:18.739
share,
significantly higher than the

00:40:18.739 --> 00:40:24.768
offer by Gas Natural,
and they think that they have a

00:40:24.768 --> 00:40:26.190
winning hand.
 

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.159
In addition,
they have all the resources.

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:32.251
I think that it--I seem to
remember that at that time E.On

00:40:32.251 --> 00:40:36.630
has cash on the balance sheet
for about €100 billion--

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:43.030
it's going to cost about $40 or
$42 billion?

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:49.570
Again, they don't go anywhere
and they get stalled,

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:55.067
at that point,
Enel, that has been watching

00:40:55.067 --> 00:41:00.170
the situation,
sees an opportunity.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:06.992
There is a bid by Gas Natural
that doesn't seem to go anywhere

00:41:06.992 --> 00:41:13.480
because of political opposition,
and because it's cheap.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.909
There is a bid by the leading
European champion,

00:41:17.909 --> 00:41:23.260
a utility, that is a lot richer
and can become a lot richer,

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:29.199
but doesn't go anywhere because
the Spanish government is

00:41:29.199 --> 00:41:34.610
reluctant to sell or to have one
of the utility--

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:41.550
one of the national champions
end up in German hands.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:48.313
Enel sees an opening and a
strategy based on three

00:41:48.313 --> 00:41:49.969
variables.
 

00:41:49.969 --> 00:41:56.268
One they say,
maybe we can pay as much as

00:41:56.268 --> 00:42:00.666
E.On,
we don't have the same cash on

00:42:00.666 --> 00:42:04.849
the balance sheet but we have no
debt,

00:42:04.849 --> 00:42:10.079
so we can try to fight it on
that.

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:17.010
Second, is we might be more
acceptable to the Spanish

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:23.010
government and that needs to be
found out,

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.577
and the third is,
and this is really in my

00:42:25.577 --> 00:42:29.005
opinion the winning--
this is really the winning

00:42:29.005 --> 00:42:33.398
perception of Enel,
they say why should we buy off

00:42:33.398 --> 00:42:38.097
those construction companies,
for the biggest construction

00:42:38.097 --> 00:42:41.929
company that are--
that is in the capital.

00:42:41.929 --> 00:42:48.539
That can be our ally in
unlocking the situation.

00:42:48.539 --> 00:42:53.119
Why should we try to buy them
out?

00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:57.360
Why don't we simply go and talk
to the entrepreneur--

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.936
this construction is usually
one entrepreneur for each

00:43:00.936 --> 00:43:03.442
company,
why don't we go and talk to the

00:43:03.442 --> 00:43:05.659
entrepreneur and see what do you
want.

00:43:05.659 --> 00:43:06.769
You want cash?
 

00:43:06.769 --> 00:43:07.760
We'll give it to you.
 

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.257
If you want a piece of the
company, we will make a deal

00:43:11.257 --> 00:43:11.969
with you.
 

00:43:11.969 --> 00:43:13.880
What do you want?
 

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:18.440
Oddly--naturally,
now the entrepreneur says,

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.369
"No, no,
no the reason why I'm here is

00:43:21.369 --> 00:43:24.090
because I want to diversify my
risk,

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:28.340
I want significant
opportunities to growth--

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:33.327
to grow and so what I really
want is not cash but is a piece

00:43:33.327 --> 00:43:34.849
of Endesa."
 

00:43:34.849 --> 00:43:44.568
Enel says, okay let's discuss,
rationally now the

00:43:44.568 --> 00:43:50.641
entrepreneur,
which is Acciona,

00:43:50.641 --> 00:43:52.869
stalls.
 

00:43:52.869 --> 00:43:57.099
Enel tried to force his hand
does something very unusual.

00:43:57.099 --> 00:44:01.789
In very, very unusual in a
cross border takeover company,

00:44:01.789 --> 00:44:07.739
goes into the market,
and buys 10% of Endesa in the

00:44:07.739 --> 00:44:11.139
market,
which according to Spanish

00:44:11.139 --> 00:44:15.615
regulation you can do,
and Enel has not launched a bid

00:44:15.615 --> 00:44:16.010
yet.
 

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.219
It's someone coming out of the
left field,

00:44:18.219 --> 00:44:23.179
so they go into the market and
they buy 10%,

00:44:23.179 --> 00:44:30.596
€39 per share,
higher than the bid for the bid

00:44:30.596 --> 00:44:32.079
by E.On.
 

00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:35.155
At that point they sit around
the table with the entrepreneur

00:44:35.155 --> 00:44:39.159
and say,
"See, we are very serious,

00:44:39.159 --> 00:44:43.695
so we are either going--either
we are going to buy this company

00:44:43.695 --> 00:44:50.996
or E.On is going to buy it,
or we make a deal and together

00:44:50.996 --> 00:44:53.889
we buy it."
 

00:44:53.889 --> 00:44:59.929
Long negotiations start with
the entrepreneur,

00:44:59.929 --> 00:45:04.831
and at the end,
a deal in this negotiation Enel

00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:07.568
again--
the entrepreneur stalls again

00:45:07.568 --> 00:45:11.393
or tried to get more,
so Enel again decides to be

00:45:11.393 --> 00:45:16.398
aggressive and does an equity
swap for a remaining 14% or

00:45:16.398 --> 00:45:21.494
14.99% of the capital which is
the maximum permitted under

00:45:21.494 --> 00:45:23.639
Spanish regulation.
 

00:45:23.639 --> 00:45:27.750
It tells the entrepreneur,
"See we are here to stay,

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:32.420
we now own 25% of the company,
we own more than you do,

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:33.809
and you will not get rid of us.
 

00:45:33.809 --> 00:45:38.878
At the same time they show E.On
that they own 25% and so that

00:45:38.878 --> 00:45:43.610
they are possibly in a position
to block the takeover.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:47.730
So this is a battle being
fought with two fronts.

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:52.201
One, the only opportunity to
win, Enel rightly decides is to

00:45:52.201 --> 00:45:54.929
make a deal with the
entrepreneur;

00:45:54.929 --> 00:46:02.945
and two at the same time they
have to fight the offer by E.On

00:46:02.945 --> 00:46:08.956
which, as you can see,
increases this offer to

00:46:08.956 --> 00:46:12.030
€40 per share.
 

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:17.344
At the same time,
Enel has been negotiating with

00:46:17.344 --> 00:46:24.353
entrepreneur and they strike a
deal in which 25% is going to be

00:46:24.353 --> 00:46:30.157
owned directly by Enel,
but 51% of the shares are going

00:46:30.157 --> 00:46:35.096
to be owned by a joint venture
company made by Enel and the

00:46:35.096 --> 00:46:40.668
entrepreneur who is Acciona,
where the entrepreneur has 51%,

00:46:40.668 --> 00:46:45.996
and the entrepreneur who is
scared about being trapped into

00:46:45.996 --> 00:46:50.039
a situation that is not liquid
also has--

00:46:50.039 --> 00:46:52.690
also negotiate with Enel,
a right of put,

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:59.320
to put to Enel his own shares
for--his own shares in Endesa,

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:03.539
for the same price that it has
been negotiated,

00:47:03.539 --> 00:47:07.710
the €41 per share.
 

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:10.489
As you have seen--sorry I moved
it--

00:47:10.489 --> 00:47:18.139
as you have seen the final
battle is won by Enel,

00:47:18.139 --> 00:47:21.396
it made a deal with E.On on the
side in which E.On is going to

00:47:21.396 --> 00:47:23.639
be sold about $10 billion dollar
asset,

00:47:23.639 --> 00:47:27.807
€10 billion asset and so
E.On also gets a foothold in the

00:47:27.807 --> 00:47:31.840
Spanish market but Endesa stays
more or less what it is,

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.789
and the situation is Enel,
Acciona,

00:47:35.789 --> 00:47:45.030
with Acciona has a right of put
to Enel for the shares that they

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.909
own.
 

00:47:45.909 --> 00:47:48.268
Am I going too fast?
 

00:47:48.268 --> 00:47:50.858
Prof: You're doing fine,
but you've only got about three

00:47:50.858 --> 00:47:51.820
or four minutes left.
 

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.380
Paolo Zanonni:
 I know but the rest is

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.079
just the end of it.
 

00:47:57.079 --> 00:48:03.277
The situation is that the
Endesa/E.On folds,

00:48:03.277 --> 00:48:09.909
and Endesa is now owned by Enel
and Acciona.

00:48:09.909 --> 00:48:15.210
Now in the meantime,
what happens in the world--

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:20.840
and what happens is that there
is a credit crunch,

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:29.032
which, in the case of Spain,
overlaps with a very severe

00:48:29.032 --> 00:48:35.440
downturn in construction and
real estate.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:40.492
You have--we need to
differentiate here between

00:48:40.492 --> 00:48:42.909
different countries.
 

00:48:42.909 --> 00:48:47.090
You have to think that the
reliance on debt and the

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:50.768
reliance on construction and
real estate,

00:48:50.768 --> 00:48:56.128
in the case of Spain,
was so high that while in

00:48:56.128 --> 00:49:03.119
Europe you have an unemployment
rate that is below 10% and in

00:49:03.119 --> 00:49:07.780
the states you have one that is
10%.

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:14.594
In Spain you have an
unemployment rate which is 24%,

00:49:14.594 --> 00:49:17.000
if well counted.
 

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.664
The whole model of development
of the Spanish economy is in

00:49:22.664 --> 00:49:27.936
doubt, or is in crisis,
because of the severe crisis in

00:49:27.936 --> 00:49:31.159
construction and real estate.
 

00:49:31.159 --> 00:49:35.509
It's easier to add that most of
the companies that have been

00:49:35.509 --> 00:49:38.800
operating there,
including Acciona,

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:44.994
the partner of E.On had been
buying shares with loans by the

00:49:44.994 --> 00:49:46.780
Spanish banks.
 

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:51.389
Not only you have the collapse
in the prices of the real estate

00:49:51.389 --> 00:49:54.130
asset,
you have also the trouble in

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:56.940
refinancing the loan that have
been--

00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:02.987
the money that has been
borrowed by the construction

00:50:02.987 --> 00:50:04.409
companies.
 

00:50:04.409 --> 00:50:08.510
So for instance,
Enel partner starts running

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:13.208
into financial trouble,
it starts running into

00:50:13.208 --> 00:50:18.853
financial troubles that are so
big that probably the only

00:50:18.853 --> 00:50:23.190
security that he can give to the
banks,

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:27.639
or renewing the loan that they
have extended to him,

00:50:27.639 --> 00:50:33.340
is the put of the 25% of Endesa
that he owns,

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:38.739
or 25 point something to Enel.
 

00:50:38.739 --> 00:50:43.059
That put, by the way,
is at a price,

00:50:43.059 --> 00:50:48.489
that is the price of the bid,
which is 41.

00:50:48.489 --> 00:50:53.170
At the same time the price of
the Endesa shares of the market

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:56.681
have gone down to 20 or 25,
between 20 and 25,

00:50:56.681 --> 00:50:59.099
but that doesn't mean much.
 

00:50:59.099 --> 00:51:04.722
Enel sees the opportunity to
get control of all of the Endesa

00:51:04.722 --> 00:51:07.217
shares,
approaches the entrepreneur and

00:51:07.217 --> 00:51:10.876
says,
okay you have the right of put

00:51:10.876 --> 00:51:14.014
for 2011,
why don't we negotiate a

00:51:14.014 --> 00:51:18.586
situation in which we would pay
you less than €31 per

00:51:18.586 --> 00:51:22.583
share,
you will get some assets,

00:51:22.583 --> 00:51:27.820
and we will get your 25% of the
shares,

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:31.800
so there is an extensive
negotiation,

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:38.829
and Enel ends up buying the 25%
of Acciona,

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:44.088
dissolving the joint venture
and getting control of 92% of

00:51:44.088 --> 00:51:44.920
Endesa.
 

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:48.518
However, you can see what this
does to Enel.

00:51:48.518 --> 00:51:54.510
The bid was largely based on
debt, the purchase;

00:51:54.510 --> 00:52:00.309
the accelerated purchase of the
shares has increased the debt,

00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:06.929
so now Enel finds itself with
$22 or $23 billion dollar market

00:52:06.929 --> 00:52:09.967
cap,
equity market cap of $65

00:52:09.967 --> 00:52:11.960
billion dollar debt.
 

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:18.173
The change in--the change that
the management wanted has

00:52:18.173 --> 00:52:20.733
occurred,
but what happened is that

00:52:20.733 --> 00:52:22.710
because of the way that the
management,

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:25.061
and because of the
circumstances,

00:52:25.061 --> 00:52:29.621
there is a huge load of debt on
the company and it is true that

00:52:29.621 --> 00:52:34.253
they wanted to have a more risky
company with a higher potential

00:52:34.253 --> 00:52:37.217
of goals,
but investors are not very

00:52:37.217 --> 00:52:41.550
happy about having invested in a
company in which the equity--

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:46.268
the debt to equity ratio is
3:1, or 3.2:1.

00:52:46.268 --> 00:52:52.188
Enel thinks that a capital
increase in order to--a dividend

00:52:52.188 --> 00:52:55.760
reduction and a capital
increase.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.869
What is the problem?
 

00:52:56.869 --> 00:52:59.610
The problem is nothing,
probably there is enough room,

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:01.590
we advise them,
there is enough room--

00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:05.530
there is enough appetite in the
market to do a capital decrease,

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:10.349
but the problem is that the
Italian government directly

00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:14.934
through the treasury is--
holds 32% of Enel,

00:53:14.934 --> 00:53:18.998
and as you know,
these are not European and

00:53:18.998 --> 00:53:23.503
American governments these days
are saddled with a large amount

00:53:23.503 --> 00:53:26.409
of debt that they will have to
repay.

00:53:26.409 --> 00:53:30.626
So at the level of the Italian
government there is very little

00:53:30.626 --> 00:53:33.670
appetite for subscribing the
rights issue.

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:37.123
On the other hand,
there is very little appetite

00:53:37.123 --> 00:53:41.900
for being diluted and make Enel
into a totally public company,

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.179
because when you own more than
30%,

00:53:44.179 --> 00:53:45.849
according to Italian law more
or less,

00:53:45.849 --> 00:53:49.840
you nominate 100% of the board
or 90% of the board.

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:55.889
There is the final effort by
the management is a negotiation,

00:53:55.889 --> 00:53:58.679
this time not with the Spanish
government,

00:53:58.679 --> 00:54:01.534
but with the Italian
government, in order to try to

00:54:01.534 --> 00:54:05.018
convince the government to let
the capital increase go forward

00:54:05.018 --> 00:54:07.360
and either be diluted or
subscribed,

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.539
and this is not concerned to
the class,

00:54:10.539 --> 00:54:15.041
but the government eventually
gave up and found a way in which

00:54:15.041 --> 00:54:18.806
they could subscribe to the
capital increase without

00:54:18.806 --> 00:54:22.719
increasing the government
deficit of the country.

00:54:22.719 --> 00:54:26.135
Prof: Thanks Paolo,
we look forward to having you

00:54:26.135 --> 00:54:27.440
back in the Spring.
 

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:33.000

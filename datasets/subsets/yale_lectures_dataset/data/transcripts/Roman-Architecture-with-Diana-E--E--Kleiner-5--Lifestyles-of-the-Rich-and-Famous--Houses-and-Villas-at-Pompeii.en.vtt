00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.070
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.486
As you can see,
the title of today's lecture is

00:00:06.486 --> 00:00:10.943
"Lifestyles of the Rich and
Famous: Houses and Villas at

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:12.280
Pompeii."
 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.420
We spoke last time about the
public architecture of Pompeii,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.520
about the forum,
about the temples,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.960
about the basilica,
about the baths,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.680
and also about shops,
and tombs as well.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.880
But today we're going to turn
to the residential architecture

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.760
of Pompeii;
residential architecture that

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.251
is extremely important,
not only for what it tells us

00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:40.279
about Pompeii,
but what it also tells us about

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:43.570
domestic architecture in the
first centuries B.C.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.344
and the first century A.D.,
because there is no place where

00:00:48.344 --> 00:00:52.460
the houses are better preserved
than at Pompeii.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.230
So it tells us again,
not just about the city itself,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.500
but also about residential
architecture in Rome,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.006
where we have very few
examples, and elsewhere in the

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:02.950
Roman world.
 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.650
I want to begin with the image
that you see now on the screen,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.254
which is a building--and we're
talking about the one at the

00:01:11.254 --> 00:01:14.010
left,
front left--a building that is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.909
on one of Pompeii's main
thoroughfares,

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.180
the Via dell'Abbondanza,
the Via dell'Abbondanza,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.188
the Street of Abundance.
 

00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:25.870
And the building in question is
relatively well preserved,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.614
and what is significant about
it for us right now is the fact

00:01:30.614 --> 00:01:33.920
that it is two-storied,
as you can see here.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.919
What we'll see in the course of
today's presentation is that

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:39.515
most of the buildings,
most of the houses,

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:42.690
in early Pompeii,
are single-story dwellings,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.500
but here we see one that is
two-storied.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.750
And this two-storied dwelling
actually dates fairly late in

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.720
the history of residential
architecture in Pompeii.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.296
It dates sometime between the
earthquake of 62 and the

00:01:56.296 --> 00:02:01.260
eruption of Vesuvius of 79;
so between 62 and 79 A.D.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.069
And we see that it has two
stories, in this instance.

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.740
A story down below that may
have been--

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.508
that says has entranceways,
might even have been opened up

00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:14.486
as a shop,
and then a second story that is

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:16.378
very interesting indeed.
 

00:02:16.378 --> 00:02:19.580
And it has what we call
cenaculae,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.860
c-e-n-a-c-u-l-a-e,
cenaculae,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.587
which are second-story dining
rooms that have open panoramic

00:02:27.587 --> 00:02:29.276
windows,
these windows,

00:02:29.276 --> 00:02:31.180
as you can see,
through columns.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.870
So an interesting nod to
Hellenization once again,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.815
this idea of incorporating
Greek elements into Roman

00:02:39.815 --> 00:02:42.907
architecture --
elements that again are under-

00:02:42.907 --> 00:02:45.513
that come into Roman
architecture through the

00:02:45.513 --> 00:02:48.120
influence of earlier Greek
architecture,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.900
and views out through those
columns.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.258
So two important points:
one, that these have two

00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:56.170
stories,
and that adding a second story

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.441
to a Roman building,
or a Pompeian building in this

00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:03.479
instance,
doesn't occur until between the

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:06.270
earthquake and the eruption of
Vesuvius;

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.800
and secondarily,
this idea of the picture

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.370
window.
 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.063
And we've talked about the
importance for the Romans of

00:03:12.063 --> 00:03:14.460
vista and panorama,
and they're doing it here.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.871
They're opening up that second
floor so that you can sit in one

00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:20.897
of these dining rooms and then
have a very nice view out

00:03:20.897 --> 00:03:23.758
through the columns of the
street and the street life

00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:24.419
below.
 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.585
Now this building,
on the Via dell'Abbondanza,

00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:31.383
lies at the end of the
development of Pompeian domestic

00:03:31.383 --> 00:03:32.580
architecture.
 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.182
And so what I'm going to do is
take us back to the beginning

00:03:37.182 --> 00:03:41.551
and trace Pompeian domestic
architecture from the Samnite

00:03:41.551 --> 00:03:45.220
period up through the eruption
of Vesuvius.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.232
With regard to the earliest
houses at Pompeii,

00:03:48.232 --> 00:03:51.378
these were done during again
the Samnite period,

00:03:51.378 --> 00:03:53.990
the fourth and third centuries
B.C.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.610
Keep in mind that the Samnites
were an Italic tribe,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.348
that is, indigenous to Italy
from way back when--

00:04:00.348 --> 00:04:04.568
I had mentioned to you that
Pompeii was founded already in

00:04:04.568 --> 00:04:06.419
the eighth century B.C.
 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.340
And these Italic tribes built
houses,

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.651
obviously, in which they lived
already in the fourth and third

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:14.905
--
substantial houses -- in which

00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:18.839
they lived already in the fourth
and third centuries B.C.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.908
I want to begin our
conversation about domestic

00:04:21.908 --> 00:04:25.110
architecture in Pompeii,
and by extension in Rome

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.579
itself, with the so-called
Domus Italica.

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:31.209
What was the Domus
Italica?

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:34.543
The Domus Italica was an
ideal Roman house plan,

00:04:34.543 --> 00:04:38.125
and we know quite a bit about
it because of the writings of

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:38.990
Vitruvius.
 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.389
Vitruvius -- not to be confused
with Vesuvius --

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.456
Vitruvius was an architectural
theoretician who was writing in

00:04:47.456 --> 00:04:50.677
the age of Augustus,
Augustus being Rome's first

00:04:50.677 --> 00:04:51.240
emperor.
 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.017
And Vitruvius left a great deal
of writings about all kinds of

00:04:55.017 --> 00:04:57.470
architecture,
including domestic

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.797
architecture,
and he talks in detail about

00:05:00.797 --> 00:05:05.745
the Domus Italica or what
he considered the ideal Roman

00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:08.132
house,
and he describes all of its

00:05:08.132 --> 00:05:08.500
parts.
 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.168
And through his writings we can
explore together what the ideal

00:05:13.168 --> 00:05:16.055
Roman house was,
and what you're going to find

00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:18.728
very interesting,
I believe, is the fact that the

00:05:18.728 --> 00:05:20.670
actual houses at Pompeii
conform,

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.184
or the earliest houses,
conform very closely to this

00:05:24.184 --> 00:05:25.079
ideal plan.
 

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:28.836
Let's run through it together,
both in plan and in restored

00:05:28.836 --> 00:05:29.290
view.
 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.769
Again I'm going to need to go
over a lot of terminology here,

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:35.954
but I guarantee you I'm going
to repeat it enough today that

00:05:35.954 --> 00:05:39.137
it will be indelibly marked on
your minds and you won't even

00:05:39.137 --> 00:05:41.221
have to--
I don't think you'll even have

00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:43.012
to study this,
when the time comes,

00:05:43.012 --> 00:05:45.964
because you're going to know
these parts of the houses so

00:05:45.964 --> 00:05:48.019
well after we go through them
today.

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:51.519
Here you see the plan of the
typical Domus Italica.

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:54.550
You can see at number 1 is the
entrance into the house.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.860
The entrance to the house was
called the fauces,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.221
f-a-u-c-e-s;
the fauces or the throat

00:06:00.221 --> 00:06:00.899
of the house.
 

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:06.519
Sometimes the fauces had
before it a vestibule,

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:09.519
called a vestibulum--and
all of these words are on the

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:11.944
Monument List for you--
a vestibulum,

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:14.882
which was a place right before
the beginning of the

00:06:14.882 --> 00:06:17.305
fauces,
underneath the eaves of the

00:06:17.305 --> 00:06:19.329
house, where you could actually
stand,

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:22.060
get in from the rain in case it
was raining outside,

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.939
while you waited for the door
to be opened.

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:26.675
But in these very early
Domus Italica houses,

00:06:26.675 --> 00:06:29.089
we don't tend to see the
vestibulum.

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:31.694
So think it away for the
moment, just the fauces

00:06:31.694 --> 00:06:32.899
or throat of the house.
 

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:35.148
Then on either side of the
fauces there are two

00:06:35.148 --> 00:06:37.892
rooms,
which are called cells or

00:06:37.892 --> 00:06:41.959
cellae: cella in the singular
and cellae,

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:44.240
c-e-l-l-a-e in the plural.
 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.230
These can be treated in a
number of different ways.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.168
They can either be closed off
from the street and used as

00:06:51.168 --> 00:06:56.406
interior rooms for the house,
extra bedrooms or living

00:06:56.406 --> 00:07:00.824
spaces, or they can be,
as you see them in this ideal

00:07:00.824 --> 00:07:02.730
plan,
opened up to the street.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.074
When they are opened up to the
street they take on the role of

00:07:07.074 --> 00:07:09.994
shops or tabernae,
t-a-b-e-r-n-a-e,

00:07:09.994 --> 00:07:12.060
shops or tabernae.
 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.490
And those shops could be either
used by those who owned the

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.226
house, to make additional money,
or they could be leased out to

00:07:21.226 --> 00:07:23.290
others for their shops.
 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.586
You see the fauces leads
into the most important room of

00:07:28.586 --> 00:07:31.226
a Roman house,
the so-called atrium,

00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:33.430
the famous atrium of the Roman
house,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.829
a-t-r-i-u-m.
 

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:38.440
The atrium was the audience
hall of the house.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.475
And it's important to mention
from the outset that Roman

00:07:41.475 --> 00:07:44.951
houses had a very different role
in Roman society than houses do

00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:45.889
for us today.
 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:48.514
We tend to think of our houses
today in large parts as

00:07:48.514 --> 00:07:50.947
retreats,
as places we can get away from

00:07:50.947 --> 00:07:52.476
it all --
get away from work,

00:07:52.476 --> 00:07:54.259
get away from schoolwork and so
on,

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:55.120
and escape.
 

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.391
Although we do enjoy obviously
having friends and family visit

00:07:58.391 --> 00:08:01.449
us there, we tend to think of it
as a place of retreat.

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:04.759
This was not true in Roman
times, when the house was also a

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:07.100
place to do some very serious
business.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.949
The man of the house,
the head of the household,

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:12.540
the paterfamilias,
often greeted clients in the

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.492
atrium of the house,
and when he was away on

00:08:15.492 --> 00:08:17.815
business, or away at war,
his wife, the

00:08:17.815 --> 00:08:20.949
materfamilias,
would stand in for him and she

00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:23.379
would conduct business in the
atrium.

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:26.439
So considered a very public
part of the house,

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:29.851
a place where you wanted it to
look its best because you were

00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:32.639
going to be greeting important
visitors there,

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:34.200
to do business.
 

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.990
So the atrium is located here.
 

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.648
You can see this rectangular
pool in the center of the

00:08:39.648 --> 00:08:40.269
atrium.
 

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.378
That is the
impluvium--and you have

00:08:42.378 --> 00:08:45.495
that on the Monument List--
the impluvium of the

00:08:45.495 --> 00:08:49.106
house, which is a pool in which
they collected rain water for

00:08:49.106 --> 00:08:49.889
daily use.
 

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:51.850
How did they collect that rain
water?

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:56.578
Because there was an opening in
the ceiling, also rectangular in

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:57.178
shape.
 

00:08:57.178 --> 00:08:59.644
That's called a
compluvium,

00:08:59.644 --> 00:09:04.202
and the compluvium had
surrounding it a slanted roof to

00:09:04.202 --> 00:09:08.089
encourage the water obviously to
slide in through the

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:13.168
compluvium and land in
the impluvium down below.

00:09:13.168 --> 00:09:18.090
Around the atrium and also
around the impluvium,

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.070
at 4 here, are the bedrooms of
the house,

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.840
the cubiculum,
in the singular,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.962
and cubicula,
in the plural:

00:09:26.962 --> 00:09:29.899
the cubicula or bedrooms
of the house.

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:32.918
And you can see that each one
of them opens up off the atrium.

00:09:32.918 --> 00:09:36.293
They are very small in size,
smaller than any other rooms in

00:09:36.293 --> 00:09:39.668
the house, and they were
literally just a place to sleep.

00:09:39.668 --> 00:09:42.019
They were very small,
mostly very dark.

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:43.850
Some of them had slit windows.
 

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.190
I'll show you one of those
later.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.018
Many of them didn't have any
windows, they were literally

00:09:48.018 --> 00:09:49.178
just sleeping spaces.
 

00:09:49.178 --> 00:09:51.773
Over here, at 5,
we see the wings or the

00:09:51.773 --> 00:09:55.099
alae, a-l-a-e--the wings
or the alae,

00:09:55.099 --> 00:09:58.091
ala in the
singular--alae of the

00:09:58.091 --> 00:09:58.889
house.
 

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:02.210
The wings of the house were a
very important place from the

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.357
point of view of family
tradition and religious practice

00:10:05.357 --> 00:10:06.158
and so on.
 

00:10:06.158 --> 00:10:09.688
It was the place where the
Romans kept the shrines of their

00:10:09.688 --> 00:10:10.418
ancestors.
 

00:10:10.418 --> 00:10:13.918
They had wooden shrines--they
were usually made out of wood--

00:10:13.918 --> 00:10:18.650
with doors, and they kept
inside those the busts and

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:23.214
portraits of their ancestors,
and they would take those out,

00:10:23.214 --> 00:10:26.456
they would open those shrines
up and take those out on special

00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:28.958
occasions,
usually anniversaries marking

00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.750
the anniversary of the death of
the deceased.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.384
And they had an interesting
practice in which the member of

00:10:35.384 --> 00:10:38.955
the family who most closely
resembled the deceased in size

00:10:38.955 --> 00:10:42.903
and general appearance would put
on that mask and participate in

00:10:42.903 --> 00:10:45.658
a kind of parade in honor of the
dead.

00:10:45.658 --> 00:10:48.658
So they kept those in those
shrines, in the wings or the

00:10:48.658 --> 00:10:50.129
alae of the house.
 

00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:54.111
Here at 6 on axis--and we know
how much the Romans liked

00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:58.817
axiality as well as symmetry--
we see the room over here,

00:10:58.817 --> 00:11:03.960
at 6, is on axis with the
fauces and the atrium.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.730
This room is called the
tablinum,

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.009
t-a-b-l-i-n-u-m,
the tablinum,

00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:12.298
which started as the master
bedroom of the house,

00:11:12.298 --> 00:11:14.585
the most important bedroom,
much larger than the

00:11:14.585 --> 00:11:17.493
cubicula,
but over time it became a place

00:11:17.493 --> 00:11:19.860
where the family archives were
kept.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.956
And beyond that--and we'll see
it happening pretty early

00:11:22.956 --> 00:11:26.423
actually today--
it becomes almost a kind of

00:11:26.423 --> 00:11:31.602
passageway between the atrium
and the area that lay beyond

00:11:31.602 --> 00:11:32.330
here.
 

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:37.139
At 7 we see also a fairly large
room,

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:39.100
the dining room or
triclinium,

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.379
and you can see in this case,
in the ideal Roman house,

00:11:41.379 --> 00:11:44.621
it opens off the atrium;
so easy to get to from the

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:45.230
atrium.
 

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.212
And then at the back,
number 8, for one of these

00:11:48.212 --> 00:11:50.897
ideal Roman houses,
the hortus,

00:11:50.897 --> 00:11:53.899
h-o-r-t-u-s,
or the garden of the house,

00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:56.168
which was obviously open to the
sky.

00:11:56.168 --> 00:12:00.352
If you look at the restored
view, you can see how these

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:04.460
earliest houses really had a
very enclosed feeling.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.083
They were quite stark and
geometrically ordered,

00:12:07.083 --> 00:12:08.480
with very few openings.
 

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.057
You can see,
in this case,

00:12:10.057 --> 00:12:12.706
this one opening as an
entranceway into the

00:12:12.706 --> 00:12:15.229
fauces,
as well as into two shops,

00:12:15.229 --> 00:12:16.870
as you can see here.
 

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.006
And then, of course,
the compluvium,

00:12:19.006 --> 00:12:21.601
a hole in the ceiling,
and then the hortus is

00:12:21.601 --> 00:12:22.620
open to the sky.
 

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.524
But, other than that,
there are no windows

00:12:24.524 --> 00:12:25.129
whatsoever.
 

00:12:25.129 --> 00:12:27.940
It's a very enclosed structure.
 

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.777
And we're going to see that
although that's the case in the

00:12:30.777 --> 00:12:32.490
beginning that changes over
time;

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.710
we'll see a very important and
interesting evolution.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:40.577
Now another point that I want
to make from the start is just

00:12:40.577 --> 00:12:43.964
as in temple architecture,
and we've traced the

00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:46.399
development of early Roman
temple architecture,

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:50.240
where we saw the Romans
ultimately using--

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.710
combining an Etruscan plan with
a Greek elevation.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.190
We're going to see something
actually quite similar happening

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.960
in the development of Pompeian
and Roman domestic architecture.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.932
We're going to see that
Etruscan, earlier Etruscan

00:13:04.932 --> 00:13:06.570
monuments, had an impact.
 

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:11.200
And I show you a plan of an
Etruscan tomb over here--

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.928
we've looked at this before--an
Etruscan tomb over here,

00:13:13.928 --> 00:13:17.092
just to show you that the
general arrangement of that

00:13:17.092 --> 00:13:19.200
tomb,
with an entranceway here,

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.774
with two rooms over here,
kind of like the

00:13:21.774 --> 00:13:23.629
tabernae that we looked
at,

00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:25.798
or the cells that we looked at
just before.

00:13:25.798 --> 00:13:28.658
A big space over here,
not unlike the atrium.

00:13:28.658 --> 00:13:31.379
The idea of axiality:
entering into it,

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:33.610
then this large space,
then another space which

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.520
mirrors the tablinum or
is like the tablinum of

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.163
the Roman house,
and then other rooms on either

00:13:39.163 --> 00:13:39.490
side.
 

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.548
So this whole idea of this
progression of one space,

00:13:42.548 --> 00:13:45.738
an axial progression of one
space to another space to

00:13:45.738 --> 00:13:48.620
another space that's on the same
axial focus;

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.542
very important,
and I think those who were

00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:55.390
building these fairly early on,
the Samnites and so on,

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.668
were clearly looking at
Etruscan examples.

00:13:58.668 --> 00:14:00.610
And it shows us,
very early on also,

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.413
that in the minds of the Romans
there was a very close

00:14:03.413 --> 00:14:06.642
association between the houses
of the living and the houses of

00:14:06.642 --> 00:14:07.330
the dead.
 

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.899
Because if you look at the
inside of this Etruscan

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:12.806
tomb--and I mention it;
I'm not holding you responsible

00:14:12.806 --> 00:14:15.586
for it, but I mention it to you
underneath the Domus

00:14:15.586 --> 00:14:17.440
Italica on the Monument
List.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.325
This is the Tomb of the Shields
and Seats in Cerveteri of the

00:14:21.325 --> 00:14:22.620
sixth century B.C.
 

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.628
And if you look at it,
you can see that inside the

00:14:25.628 --> 00:14:27.660
tomb--
it's all carved from the rock,

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.028
from the tufa rock--
you can see that it looks very

00:14:30.028 --> 00:14:32.220
much like what you'd expect a
house to look like,

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.210
with beds.
 

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.970
And notice the detail.
 

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.750
They've even provided--it's all
done in stone,

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.110
the tufa stone -- but you see
they've even provided stone

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.062
pillows here,
not very comfortable,

00:14:42.062 --> 00:14:45.038
but it gives you the sense of
what a house would've been like.

00:14:45.038 --> 00:14:48.808
And we know that beds in houses
looked very much these.

00:14:48.808 --> 00:14:51.629
Over here a throne,
with a nice footstool,

00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:52.798
as you can see.
 

00:14:52.798 --> 00:14:56.360
And then if you look very
carefully, also indicated in

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.450
stone, the rafters,
the beams done in stone.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.038
And then the moldings around
the door and around the shields,

00:15:03.038 --> 00:15:06.331
which is the reason this is
called the shields and the seats

00:15:06.331 --> 00:15:09.567
obviously is because it has
seats and it has shields on the

00:15:09.567 --> 00:15:10.070
wall.
 

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.428
So I just wanted to make the
point,

00:15:11.428 --> 00:15:13.806
because it'll turn up a number
of times in the course of the

00:15:13.806 --> 00:15:16.284
semester,
the close association in the

00:15:16.284 --> 00:15:20.418
minds of the Romans between
houses of the living and houses

00:15:20.418 --> 00:15:23.557
of the dead,
and also that important point

00:15:23.557 --> 00:15:27.274
that the early Samnite builders
are looking at Etruscan

00:15:27.274 --> 00:15:28.240
prototypes.
 

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.336
I want to show you now the way
in which actual Pompeian houses

00:15:32.336 --> 00:15:35.082
conform very closely--
the early ones at least,

00:15:35.082 --> 00:15:37.019
of the fourth and third
centuries B.C.--

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:41.788
conform very closely to this
Domus Italica ideal plan.

00:15:41.788 --> 00:15:46.182
I want to begin with the
so-called House of the Surgeon

00:15:46.182 --> 00:15:50.330
in Pompeii, which dates to the
third century B.C.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.673
And it's called the House of
the Surgeon because of all the

00:15:53.673 --> 00:15:56.730
surgical instruments that were
found in the house,

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.928
and I show you the array of
them now on the screen.

00:15:59.928 --> 00:16:03.149
This should be of considerable
interest, to especially--and I

00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:06.423
know there are a number of you
in here -- students whose major

00:16:06.423 --> 00:16:07.230
is biology.
 

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.879
And I want to mention also that
you might be surprised to hear--

00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:12.230
but maybe not,
Yale has such amazing

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.337
collections--
that the Medical School has a

00:16:14.337 --> 00:16:17.288
collection of surgical
instruments that goes way back,

00:16:17.288 --> 00:16:19.288
and it goes way back to ancient
Rome.

00:16:19.288 --> 00:16:22.620
You can actually see ancient
Roman surgical instruments in

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.250
that collection that we have
here at Yale,

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.798
not perhaps as many as this,
but an interesting selection,

00:16:28.798 --> 00:16:33.024
and those of you who are in
that field might at one point

00:16:33.024 --> 00:16:37.779
want to take advantage of that
and get to see them firsthand.

00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:40.381
So this house got its name from
this cache of surgical

00:16:40.381 --> 00:16:42.200
instruments that were found
inside.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.366
That probably gives us some
sense of the profession of at

00:16:45.366 --> 00:16:47.970
least one of the people who was
living here.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.570
I show you the plan of the
House of the Surgeon,

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:55.129
and you'll see a version on
your Monument List that actually

00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:58.600
has the rooms designated there,
which I don't have here.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.691
So that will be helpful to you
as you--I wanted you to have

00:17:01.691 --> 00:17:04.144
that version so that you,
when you're studying,

00:17:04.144 --> 00:17:05.690
you have that before you.
 

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.161
And in any exam,
by the way, even if I show

00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:11.866
something slightly different in
class, I will show you only what

00:17:11.866 --> 00:17:14.278
is on your Monument List in the
exam.

00:17:14.278 --> 00:17:16.390
So those are the ones that you
should study and remember.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.480
But you'll see the plan is
exactly the same.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.348
It just doesn't have the labels
here.

00:17:20.348 --> 00:17:23.824
So we can see that it conforms,
the House of the Surgeon,

00:17:23.824 --> 00:17:26.306
third century B.C.,
to the ideal Domus

00:17:26.306 --> 00:17:27.609
Italica plan.
 

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.741
You enter here;
you enter into the

00:17:29.741 --> 00:17:32.088
fauces or throat of the
house.

00:17:32.088 --> 00:17:34.578
There are two cells,
one on either side.

00:17:34.578 --> 00:17:37.989
It's very clear in plan that
this cell is closed to the

00:17:37.989 --> 00:17:41.714
outside and opens only off the
atrium, so used by the family

00:17:41.714 --> 00:17:43.420
for their own purposes.
 

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.694
This one is open to the street,
clearly used as a shop,

00:17:46.694 --> 00:17:49.667
either by this family,
or they've leased it out to

00:17:49.667 --> 00:17:50.759
somebody else.
 

00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:54.598
The atrium is on axis with the
fauces.

00:17:54.598 --> 00:17:58.806
We can see that the atrium has
a pool, a rectangular pool,

00:17:58.806 --> 00:18:01.721
or impluvium;
and there would've been a

00:18:01.721 --> 00:18:03.170
compluvium up above.
 

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:06.295
On either side the
cubicula or bedrooms of

00:18:06.295 --> 00:18:08.640
the house, opening off the
atrium.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.722
Over here the wings or
alae of the house,

00:18:11.722 --> 00:18:13.558
for the ancestral shrines.
 

00:18:13.558 --> 00:18:15.798
Over here, again,
a dining room,

00:18:15.798 --> 00:18:19.338
a triclinium,
that opens off the atrium.

00:18:19.338 --> 00:18:22.692
Up here we think probably a
portico, one column or two,

00:18:22.692 --> 00:18:25.362
but that might belong to a
later renovation,

00:18:25.362 --> 00:18:27.660
and I'll explain why in a
moment.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.657
And then in the back a somewhat
irregularly shaped hortus

00:18:31.657 --> 00:18:32.420
or garden.
 

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.901
But I think you can see from
this example how closely these

00:18:36.901 --> 00:18:41.228
actual houses track the Domus
Italica described by

00:18:41.228 --> 00:18:42.308
Vitruvius.
 

00:18:42.308 --> 00:18:47.082
Another example of one of these
early Roman houses that conforms

00:18:47.082 --> 00:18:51.400
to the Domus Italica type
is the so-called House of

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.868
Sallust in Pompeii that dates to
the third century B.C.

00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:59.826
This is another house that has
the Domus Italica as its

00:18:59.826 --> 00:19:00.278
core.
 

00:19:00.278 --> 00:19:03.358
But, just like most of the
houses in Pompeii--

00:19:03.358 --> 00:19:08.200
you'll remember how when the
Romans took over Pompeii in 80,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.911
or made Pompeii a Roman colony,
they tossed the Samnites out of

00:19:11.911 --> 00:19:13.664
their homes,
they took them over,

00:19:13.664 --> 00:19:15.420
and of course once they took
them over,

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.470
they renovated them.
 

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.489
So there's quite a bit of
renovation that takes place to

00:19:19.489 --> 00:19:21.519
some of these early Samnite
houses.

00:19:21.519 --> 00:19:25.233
In this case the House of
Sallust seems to be an example

00:19:25.233 --> 00:19:25.910
of that.
 

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.740
But we still see the original
core of the Domus

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.548
Italica.
 

00:19:29.548 --> 00:19:33.548
The entrance over here into the
fauces of the house;

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:36.930
I'll say something about that
in a moment.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.019
The atrium on axis with that,
with the impluvium.

00:19:40.019 --> 00:19:41.500
The cubicula over here.
 

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.818
The alae or wings here.
 

00:19:43.818 --> 00:19:45.880
The tablinum of the
house over here.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.479
In this case you can see that
the triclinium opens up

00:19:50.479 --> 00:19:53.519
off toward the hortus
instead.

00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:56.949
This family wanted to provide
views of the hortus

00:19:56.949 --> 00:19:59.880
rather than the atrium,
from the dining hall.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.032
Now what's particularly
interesting, and may belong to

00:20:03.032 --> 00:20:05.711
the renovation,
are the shops that are opening

00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:07.019
up off the street.
 

00:20:07.019 --> 00:20:10.930
Because you can tell in plan
exactly how this shop was used.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.829
Anyone volunteer to say,
based on the plan?

00:20:15.829 --> 00:20:17.759
What kind of a shop was this?
 

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:18.730
Student:  Fast-food
restaurant.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:19.920
Prof: A fast-food store.
 

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.704
Yes it's a fast-food shop,
a thermopolium,

00:20:22.704 --> 00:20:26.186
because we can see the counter
and we can see the recesses in

00:20:26.186 --> 00:20:26.710
plan.
 

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.832
So this family either had,
or let its space out,

00:20:30.832 --> 00:20:33.901
for one of these
thermopolia,

00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:38.636
for one of these fast-food
stands in the front of their

00:20:38.636 --> 00:20:39.690
house.
 

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.251
So two examples,
the House of the Surgeon and

00:20:42.251 --> 00:20:44.838
the House of Sallust,
that conform closely,

00:20:44.838 --> 00:20:47.577
third century B.C.,
to the original Domus

00:20:47.577 --> 00:20:48.740
Italica plan.
 

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.960
In the second century B.C.
 

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.670
we see something happen in
house design,

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.154
quite extraordinary,
and that is linked to the same

00:20:57.154 --> 00:21:00.848
kind of development we saw in
temple architecture,

00:21:00.848 --> 00:21:03.549
and that is yes,
they've been looking at the

00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:06.336
Etruscan type of plan,
they've been conforming to that

00:21:06.336 --> 00:21:07.160
to a certain extent.
 

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.638
All of a sudden in the second
century they get the bug to make

00:21:11.638 --> 00:21:15.838
their houses look more Greek,
and they begin to incorporate

00:21:15.838 --> 00:21:19.538
elements that they take from
earlier Greek architecture,

00:21:19.538 --> 00:21:22.519
and the result is quite
extraordinary.

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:28.769
I'm showing you here an example
of an ideal plan of what we call

00:21:28.769 --> 00:21:32.503
the Hellenized Domus,
the domus that has been

00:21:32.503 --> 00:21:35.236
Hellenized,
that has been given Greek--it

00:21:35.236 --> 00:21:37.880
has been enhanced with Greek
elements.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.607
And let's run through the plan
again, of the so-called

00:21:41.607 --> 00:21:43.788
Hellenized domus type.
 

00:21:43.788 --> 00:21:48.178
You can see that the core is
the same as the Domus

00:21:48.178 --> 00:21:49.359
Italica.
 

00:21:49.359 --> 00:21:50.519
You enter over here.
 

00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:53.747
Here we can see in plan the
incorporation of the

00:21:53.747 --> 00:21:58.400
vestibulum,
this vestibule that is located

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.400
right in front of,
or at the beginning of the

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.883
fauces,
the purpose of which--you can

00:22:03.883 --> 00:22:06.346
see it right here--
the purpose of which,

00:22:06.346 --> 00:22:08.259
you kind of entered into the
house.

00:22:08.259 --> 00:22:12.088
The roof of the house protects
you in case the weather is not

00:22:12.088 --> 00:22:14.211
good,
but you still have to stand in

00:22:14.211 --> 00:22:17.271
that vestibule until you're
allowed into the fauces

00:22:17.271 --> 00:22:18.828
and the rest of the house.
 

00:22:18.828 --> 00:22:20.625
So we see here the
vestibulum,

00:22:20.625 --> 00:22:22.220
the fauces,
the two cells,

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.813
cellae, one on either side,
in this case they are not

00:22:24.813 --> 00:22:26.058
opened up as shops.
 

00:22:26.058 --> 00:22:29.459
The atrium here,
with its impluvium,

00:22:29.459 --> 00:22:31.240
to catch rain water.
 

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.270
At 4, we have the usual
cubicula,

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.358
or bedrooms.
 

00:22:35.358 --> 00:22:38.970
At 5, we have the usual
alae or wings.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:42.115
And then 6, the tablinum
on axis with 7,

00:22:42.115 --> 00:22:45.328
the triclinium opening
off the atrium.

00:22:45.328 --> 00:22:48.997
So once again the core of the
original Domus Italica,

00:22:48.997 --> 00:22:51.670
very much intact in the
Hellenized domus.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.519
But look what's happened up
here.

00:22:53.519 --> 00:22:55.788
What's happened up here is at
number 8,

00:22:55.788 --> 00:22:58.338
under the influence of Greek
architecture,

00:22:58.338 --> 00:23:00.477
under the influence of what's
happening in temple

00:23:00.477 --> 00:23:03.798
architecture,
they incorporate columns into

00:23:03.798 --> 00:23:08.422
the interior of the house,
and they place their garden

00:23:08.422 --> 00:23:08.890
here.
 

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.936
It's a garden court,
with columns,

00:23:11.936 --> 00:23:17.568
which technically is called a
peristyle, p-e-r-i-s-t-y-l-e.

00:23:17.568 --> 00:23:21.967
And it is comparable to what we
see in temple architecture when

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:25.655
we saw the architects giving
some of the temples--the

00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:28.596
peripteral colonnade;
do you remember the colonnade

00:23:28.596 --> 00:23:30.528
that goes all the way around and
is freestanding,

00:23:30.528 --> 00:23:32.338
under the influence of Greek
architecture?

00:23:32.338 --> 00:23:35.438
It's the same sort of thing
here, except it's on the inside

00:23:35.438 --> 00:23:36.400
of the building.
 

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.650
So this peristyle court cum
garden, located right here.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.193
And then on either side,
additional bedrooms or

00:23:43.193 --> 00:23:45.814
cubicula;
these were probably very

00:23:45.814 --> 00:23:49.875
desirable, to have a bedroom
that opened, had a nice view out

00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:51.230
over your garden.
 

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:55.328
And then back here two
additional triclinia,

00:23:55.328 --> 00:23:58.772
two additional dining rooms,
to take advantage of the

00:23:58.772 --> 00:24:01.288
beautiful views that one could
get,

00:24:01.288 --> 00:24:03.969
if one could see it -- probably
not terribly much through these

00:24:03.969 --> 00:24:07.211
narrow doorways,
but at least opening up onto

00:24:07.211 --> 00:24:09.028
the peristyle court.
 

00:24:09.028 --> 00:24:09.878
One second.
 

00:24:09.878 --> 00:24:13.741
We see up here the restored
view, showing the same,

00:24:13.741 --> 00:24:15.210
the entranceway.
 

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:18.008
And look here,
you can even see columns added

00:24:18.008 --> 00:24:21.192
in the front to announce,
from the very start,

00:24:21.192 --> 00:24:24.837
that this is a house that is
owned by a very cultured

00:24:24.837 --> 00:24:27.026
individual,
who knows his Greek,

00:24:27.026 --> 00:24:30.779
and knows his Greek culture,
and knows to incorporate these

00:24:30.779 --> 00:24:32.900
Greek elements into his house.
 

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.730
Then we see the
compluvium.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.154
We see the peristyle from above;
you can see,

00:24:37.154 --> 00:24:40.721
open to the sky with columns,
but still very stark,

00:24:40.721 --> 00:24:42.788
very plain on the outside.
 

00:24:42.788 --> 00:24:47.019
No windows to speak of,
very much an enclosed space.

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:49.938
Student:  I was just
wondering--I always like looking

00:24:49.938 --> 00:24:52.608
around--where the food
preparation would take place?

00:24:52.608 --> 00:24:55.284
Prof: Some of these
houses did have kitchens,

00:24:55.284 --> 00:24:57.538
and I'll show you an example in
a moment.

00:24:57.538 --> 00:25:00.048
Probably more of them did than
we're sure of.

00:25:00.048 --> 00:25:02.894
It's just a question of what
remains, in terms of being able

00:25:02.894 --> 00:25:03.858
to determine that.
 

00:25:03.858 --> 00:25:05.048
But we certainly have examples
of that.

00:25:05.048 --> 00:25:07.640
So they did seem to have
kitchens.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.416
So now I want to show you some
examples of houses that conform

00:25:11.416 --> 00:25:15.380
to the Hellenized domus
type, this being the first one.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.890
It's one of the most famous
houses in Pompeii,

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:20.798
and if you're going there
anytime soon and are making a

00:25:20.798 --> 00:25:23.797
list of must-sees,
this is one of those must-sees,

00:25:23.797 --> 00:25:25.788
in Pompeii,
the House of the Vettii.

00:25:25.788 --> 00:25:28.625
We think it belongs,
although we're not absolutely

00:25:28.625 --> 00:25:31.865
sure, to the Vettius brothers,
to the Vettius brothers in

00:25:31.865 --> 00:25:32.558
Pompeii.
 

00:25:32.558 --> 00:25:35.740
And it dates,
as the Monument List indicates,

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.619
to the second century B.C.
 

00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:38.558
and later.
 

00:25:38.558 --> 00:25:42.146
Looking at this plan you can
see the way in which it conforms

00:25:42.146 --> 00:25:44.420
to the Hellenized domus
type.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.300
Once again it has the core,
it has the Domus Italica

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:48.769
core.
 

00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:51.670
The entranceway over here,
with the fauces;

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.578
the cells on either side,
in this case used as rooms

00:25:55.578 --> 00:25:59.643
internal to the house,
they do not open off the street

00:25:59.643 --> 00:26:01.640
as shops;
the atrium here,

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.740
with the impluvium;
a smaller number of

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.390
cubicula on either side;
alae over here.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.778
Look what has happened to the
tablinum.

00:26:11.778 --> 00:26:13.690
The tablinum is gone
essentially.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:18.724
All it consists of is a couple
of pilasters that are located

00:26:18.724 --> 00:26:21.167
right here--
and I'll show them to you in a

00:26:21.167 --> 00:26:23.288
moment because it's
well-preserved pilasters here.

00:26:23.288 --> 00:26:26.190
So the tablinum has
essentially disappeared.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:30.555
It's become a kind of
passageway from the core of the

00:26:30.555 --> 00:26:32.568
house into the garden.
 

00:26:32.568 --> 00:26:35.801
And it is a peristyle garden,
surrounded by columns,

00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:36.880
as you can see.
 

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.702
And you can see how important
that peristyle garden has

00:26:40.702 --> 00:26:41.338
become.
 

00:26:41.338 --> 00:26:45.729
This family has decided to
decrease their other space in

00:26:45.729 --> 00:26:49.880
order to have this stupendously
large garden here.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.430
And they have also put a very
large dining hall,

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:56.578
triclinium up here,
that opens off the peristyle,

00:26:56.578 --> 00:27:00.857
and it has a much bigger
opening so that they could

00:27:00.857 --> 00:27:04.710
clearly dine and get views of
this garden,

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.042
this peristyle garden,
of which they were obviously

00:27:08.042 --> 00:27:09.309
incredibly proud.
 

00:27:09.309 --> 00:27:12.308
So some major changes there.
 

00:27:12.308 --> 00:27:15.170
Now this particular house--oh I
did want to say though,

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.415
despite those changes,
the house is still very

00:27:18.415 --> 00:27:22.240
enclosed and very plain and
stark from the outside.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.535
This is a restored view of what
we believe the outside looked

00:27:25.535 --> 00:27:25.920
like.
 

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.980
So geometrically ordered,
cubic, as you can see.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.526
Just one entranceway,
possibly a few small windows,

00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:33.588
possibly not.
 

00:27:33.588 --> 00:27:36.916
And then you can see the
compluvium and the

00:27:36.916 --> 00:27:38.140
peristyle court.
 

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.385
But otherwise very much
enclosed, like the earlier

00:27:41.385 --> 00:27:44.780
Domus Italica;
not much change with regard to

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.588
how the exterior of the building
is treated.

00:27:47.588 --> 00:27:50.279
This again is one of the
reasons everyone flocks to this

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:52.038
house is it's very well
preserved.

00:27:52.038 --> 00:27:53.470
There's been some restoration
work,

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.588
of course, but really this is
one of those must-sees,

00:27:56.588 --> 00:28:00.357
because it really gives you as
good a sense as anything of what

00:28:00.357 --> 00:28:02.788
these houses looked like in
antiquity.

00:28:02.788 --> 00:28:05.300
We have obviously entered
into--we've come through the

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:06.059
fauces.
 

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:08.368
We are standing in the atrium.
 

00:28:08.368 --> 00:28:11.910
We can see the pool or
impluvium here.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.808
We can see the
compluvium,

00:28:13.808 --> 00:28:15.710
very well preserved,
up above.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:18.618
I think it's probably the best
preserved compluvium that

00:28:18.618 --> 00:28:19.838
we have, or close to it.
 

00:28:19.838 --> 00:28:22.865
And you can see that there were
little antefixes added in

00:28:22.865 --> 00:28:24.757
terracotta and stuff,
as decoration,

00:28:24.757 --> 00:28:25.730
up at the top.
 

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.459
As we're standing here we look
back through what was once the

00:28:29.459 --> 00:28:32.224
tablinum,
and now is basically a point of

00:28:32.224 --> 00:28:34.825
transition,
a passageway from the atrium to

00:28:34.825 --> 00:28:37.259
the most important part of the
house,

00:28:37.259 --> 00:28:38.730
from the point of view of these
patrons,

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.670
the garden.
 

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.230
So you're looking through.
 

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:44.462
You see these great piers on
either side, that are all that's

00:28:44.462 --> 00:28:46.078
left of the tablinum.
 

00:28:46.078 --> 00:28:48.259
You look through that and you
see the garden.

00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:50.578
The garden has its columns
surrounding it.

00:28:50.578 --> 00:28:54.551
The walls are painted,
of that garden,

00:28:54.551 --> 00:28:59.170
all a very lively and wonderful
interior.

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:02.016
And what also becomes very
clear in looking at this

00:29:02.016 --> 00:29:05.490
particular view is something
that we've already discussed,

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:09.076
and that is the importance in
the minds of the Romans of vista

00:29:09.076 --> 00:29:11.854
or panorama,
of great views that you can see

00:29:11.854 --> 00:29:14.298
from one part of a building to
another.

00:29:14.298 --> 00:29:18.076
Remember the Sanctuary of
Jupiter Anxur at Terracina and

00:29:18.076 --> 00:29:22.470
all of those wonderful lateral
and axial entrances and exits,

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.048
where there were all kinds of
interesting light effects.

00:29:25.048 --> 00:29:26.640
We see the same sort of thing
here.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.289
The idea is to pass from a
particularly well-lighted area

00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:33.420
outside into a darker area,
the fauces.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.207
Then a little bit more light
added to the system through the

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:39.027
compluvium,
and then a whole host of light,

00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:41.088
that you can see in the
distance,

00:29:41.088 --> 00:29:43.848
through the open--because of
the open peristyle.

00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:46.734
So dark, light,
dark, light -- this progression

00:29:46.734 --> 00:29:50.374
of space, this progression of
light through the structure a

00:29:50.374 --> 00:29:52.568
very typical Roman thing to do.
 

00:29:52.568 --> 00:29:55.887
The other thing,
of course, is this emphasis on

00:29:55.887 --> 00:30:00.650
axiality, this movement through
a structure in a very axial way.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:04.240
The garden here,
as it looks today.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.165
It would've been,
of course, even more beautiful

00:30:06.165 --> 00:30:07.970
in antiquity,
when it would've been in better

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:08.380
shape.
 

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.685
But nonetheless,
this gives you--it's a bit

00:30:10.685 --> 00:30:13.256
overgrown now and so on--
but it gives you some sense of

00:30:13.256 --> 00:30:15.428
what it would've looked like,
with the greenery in the

00:30:15.428 --> 00:30:17.000
garden, surrounded by the
columns,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.259
with garden furniture,
little fountains,

00:30:21.259 --> 00:30:23.548
little marble fountains and the
like,

00:30:23.548 --> 00:30:26.713
and with the walls--the
paintings are not in very good

00:30:26.713 --> 00:30:29.288
shape today,
but imagine them more vibrant.

00:30:29.288 --> 00:30:32.366
And I'm going to show you
examples of that on Thursday and

00:30:32.366 --> 00:30:34.269
next week,
of some of the paintings that

00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:36.834
are in better condition and how
vibrant this would've been with

00:30:36.834 --> 00:30:37.618
those paintings.
 

00:30:37.618 --> 00:30:39.759
Look also at the columns
because you can see--

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:43.150
we'll see that some of these
columns are made out of stone,

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:48.088
some of them are made out of
those tiles,

00:30:48.088 --> 00:30:50.358
that look like bricks,
that I've shown you before.

00:30:50.358 --> 00:30:53.450
But in all cases they were
stuccoed over white.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.190
Why were they stuccoed over
white?

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:57.868
To make them look like Greek
marble.

00:30:57.868 --> 00:31:00.746
So once again,
this Hellenization of Roman

00:31:00.746 --> 00:31:04.114
domestic architecture,
this attempt to make these

00:31:04.114 --> 00:31:06.710
things look as Greek as
possible.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:08.259
You asked about the kitchen.
 

00:31:08.259 --> 00:31:10.869
Well this is our best preserved
kitchen, from Pompeii.

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:13.028
It's really quite amazing.
 

00:31:13.028 --> 00:31:17.955
There's a stove,
and the pots and pans that were

00:31:17.955 --> 00:31:23.198
clearly still sitting on the
stove at the time this

00:31:23.198 --> 00:31:28.230
particular family had to flee
from Vesuvius.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.359
And I neglected to show you,
but you can look at the

00:31:31.359 --> 00:31:34.920
Monument List for this plan,
where the rooms are marked.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.818
You will see the kitchen marked
on that plan.

00:31:37.818 --> 00:31:41.029
And you will also see what's
called the Women's Quarters,

00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:43.814
marked on that plan,
which was probably where some

00:31:43.814 --> 00:31:47.108
of the slaves who were owned by
this particular family,

00:31:47.108 --> 00:31:50.730
the Vettius brothers,
lived, in that area.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:54.788
Another example of a house that
conforms,

00:31:54.788 --> 00:31:58.086
a Pompeian house that conforms
to the Hellenized domus

00:31:58.086 --> 00:32:00.778
type is the one that you now see
on the screen.

00:32:00.778 --> 00:32:04.856
It's a plan of the House of the
Silver Wedding,

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:06.009
in Pompeii.
 

00:32:06.009 --> 00:32:09.209
We believe it was remodeled in
the first century B.C.,

00:32:09.209 --> 00:32:11.019
although it's controversial.
 

00:32:11.019 --> 00:32:14.556
It might have been remodeled a
bit later in the first century

00:32:14.556 --> 00:32:14.910
A.D.
 

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.950
It's an interesting structure.
 

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:20.696
It got its name,
the House of the Silver

00:32:20.696 --> 00:32:22.667
Wedding,
because there was a lot of

00:32:22.667 --> 00:32:25.000
fanfare in the late nineteenth
century--

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.541
I think it was precisely
1893--when the king and queen of

00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:31.390
Italy came to visit this
particular house,

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:32.848
and it became their favorite.
 

00:32:32.848 --> 00:32:36.951
And so the Silver Wedding is
actually a reference to them and

00:32:36.951 --> 00:32:39.960
to their marriage,
and so on and so forth.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.884
It's a wonderful house,
and I think you can see how it

00:32:43.884 --> 00:32:44.700
conforms.
 

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.785
Again, it has a core that is
very much the Domus

00:32:47.785 --> 00:32:51.027
Italica core,
but it is another example of

00:32:51.027 --> 00:32:55.112
one of these houses that has
been remodeled because of the

00:32:55.112 --> 00:32:58.410
owner's interest in Hellenizing
that house.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.240
We enter here through the
fauces.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.190
There are cells on either side,
opening off the fauces.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.990
It's an unusual arrangement.
 

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:11.470
Then over here the atrium with
the impluvium;

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.660
the cubicula on either
side;

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.509
the alae or wings of the
house;

00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:19.744
a dining room over here;
two peristyle courts,

00:33:19.744 --> 00:33:21.780
one in the back,
a smaller one,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:26.328
and then a huge peristyle court
over here on the left-hand side.

00:33:26.328 --> 00:33:29.623
So for this family one was not
enough, they wanted double the

00:33:29.623 --> 00:33:31.929
garden space,
and they've allotted a lot of

00:33:31.929 --> 00:33:34.180
space in this house to those
gardens.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.460
Then, most interesting of all I
think about this house,

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.190
and the reason I chose it to
show to you,

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:42.987
is that we are starting to see
the Hellenization of the atrium

00:33:42.987 --> 00:33:43.608
as well.
 

00:33:43.608 --> 00:33:45.140
Because look what's happened to
the atrium.

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:49.761
They have placed four columns
around the impluvium,

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:51.058
in the atrium.
 

00:33:51.058 --> 00:33:54.038
So it wasn't enough to have
these two large peristyles,

00:33:54.038 --> 00:33:57.183
they wanted columns everywhere,
and they placed these four

00:33:57.183 --> 00:33:58.950
around the impluvium.
 

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:02.413
An atrium that has four columns
in it is technically called--and

00:34:02.413 --> 00:34:05.769
I put it on the Monument List
for you--a tetrastyle atrium;

00:34:05.769 --> 00:34:07.680
this is a tetrastyle atrium.
 

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.849
Even that wasn't enough.
 

00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:12.260
Look at that room in the upper
left.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.900
That room in the upper left is
a banqueting hall,

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.780
an additional dining space,
but a special dining space,

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:24.829
that you can see opens up very
nicely off the smaller peristyle

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:25.809
of the house.
 

00:34:25.809 --> 00:34:28.947
The opening is fairly wide,
so it probably would've had

00:34:28.947 --> 00:34:31.679
some wonderful views of the
peristyle garden.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:35.190
And look, there are four
columns in there as well.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:38.230
And this particular banqueting
hall,

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.911
its technical name--it's got a
kind of a funny name that I

00:34:40.911 --> 00:34:43.360
don't think you'll forget called
an oecus,

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.393
o-e-c-u-s;
and it's even more amusing in

00:34:46.393 --> 00:34:50.320
the plural, because the plural
is o-e-c-i, oeci.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.420
So this is an oecus,
among oeci,

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.280
an oecus up there.
 

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.871
And you can see that it's an
oecus that has four

00:34:57.871 --> 00:35:00.382
columns in it;
so we call it a tetrastyle

00:35:00.382 --> 00:35:01.320
oecus.
 

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.668
All right, so now that we've
had an opportunity to look at

00:35:04.668 --> 00:35:07.429
the plan of the House of the
Silver Wedding,

00:35:07.429 --> 00:35:10.463
I want to give you a sense of
what the building looks like

00:35:10.463 --> 00:35:10.889
today.
 

00:35:10.889 --> 00:35:13.617
It's not as well preserved as
the House of the Vettii,

00:35:13.617 --> 00:35:16.398
but we can get a very good
sense of what it was like in

00:35:16.398 --> 00:35:17.119
antiquity.
 

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:19.945
And the oecus,
which in some respects is the

00:35:19.945 --> 00:35:22.943
most important room in the
house, from our standpoint,

00:35:22.943 --> 00:35:24.469
is very well preserved.
 

00:35:24.469 --> 00:35:26.489
We're looking here at a view.
 

00:35:26.489 --> 00:35:28.523
We're standing again in the
beginning of the atrium,

00:35:28.523 --> 00:35:29.679
looking through the atrium.
 

00:35:29.679 --> 00:35:35.112
We see the impluvium of
the house -- a lot of moss and

00:35:35.112 --> 00:35:37.739
some--it's overgrown today.
 

00:35:37.739 --> 00:35:40.295
But nonetheless you can see it
there, as well as the

00:35:40.295 --> 00:35:41.599
compluvium above.
 

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:45.702
What's most important to us is
you can see that this is indeed

00:35:45.702 --> 00:35:49.005
a tetrastyle atrium,
with four columns that are

00:35:49.005 --> 00:35:51.369
surrounding the
impluvium,

00:35:51.369 --> 00:35:55.199
those columns supporting the
ceiling,

00:35:55.199 --> 00:35:57.349
and of course the
compluvium above.

00:35:57.349 --> 00:36:00.610
Also interesting is the way in
which the columns are treated.

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:04.650
You can see that they have been
fluted and then stuccoed over.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.289
Do you remember the temple at
Cori,

00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:08.724
that we looked at,
where we talked about the fact

00:36:08.724 --> 00:36:11.038
that--
the Temple of Hercules at Cori

00:36:11.038 --> 00:36:15.045
-- we talked about the fact that
the columns were fluted part of

00:36:15.045 --> 00:36:16.998
the way,
and then down below those

00:36:16.998 --> 00:36:19.565
flutes were covered over with
stucco and the stucco was

00:36:19.565 --> 00:36:20.090
painted.
 

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.829
We see the same thing here.
 

00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:23.853
And if you look very,
very closely,

00:36:23.853 --> 00:36:26.530
you can even see the remains of
the red paint,

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.400
the red paint that decorated
the lower part of these columns.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.393
So some interesting
correspondences there in terms

00:36:33.393 --> 00:36:34.800
of building practice.
 

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.940
You can also see here,
as we saw in the House of the

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.934
Vettii,
this wonderful vista from the

00:36:38.934 --> 00:36:41.612
atrium of the house,
through what remains of the

00:36:41.612 --> 00:36:44.811
tablinum,
into the garden of the house,

00:36:44.811 --> 00:36:47.559
the peristyle garden of the
house,

00:36:47.559 --> 00:36:50.561
which from the patron's point
of view was one of the most

00:36:50.561 --> 00:36:53.230
important,
if not the most important part,

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.119
of the house.
 

00:36:54.119 --> 00:36:58.920
This is the oecus of the
House of the Silver Wedding,

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.449
and you can see it is extremely
well preserved,

00:37:01.449 --> 00:37:03.869
and you can also see how very
interesting it is,

00:37:03.869 --> 00:37:05.159
in all kinds of ways.
 

00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:07.409
It is a tetrastyle
oecus--again,

00:37:07.409 --> 00:37:09.896
a banqueting hall--tetrastyle
oecus,

00:37:09.896 --> 00:37:11.199
with four columns.
 

00:37:11.199 --> 00:37:14.820
Those columns are stuccoed and
painted over.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.530
The paint is very well
preserved.

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:19.215
It's a reddish,
purplish color,

00:37:19.215 --> 00:37:24.050
probably meant to conjure up
porphyry, p-o-r-p-h-y-r-y,

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:27.809
porphyry, which comes only from
Egypt.

00:37:27.809 --> 00:37:31.295
It's only quarried in Egypt,
very expensive to bring it that

00:37:31.295 --> 00:37:33.719
great distance,
all the way to Pompeii.

00:37:33.719 --> 00:37:35.251
And, of course,
this isn't porphyry,

00:37:35.251 --> 00:37:36.518
it's just a painted column.
 

00:37:36.518 --> 00:37:40.394
But the whole idea of this,
from the patrons' point of

00:37:40.394 --> 00:37:43.626
view,
was to look like he and she

00:37:43.626 --> 00:37:47.585
were very well-heeled,
that they could afford to

00:37:47.585 --> 00:37:51.246
bring--they're trying to make
the illusion that they could

00:37:51.246 --> 00:37:53.880
afford to bring this expensive
stone,

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.389
from very far away,
to use in their house here.

00:37:57.389 --> 00:38:02.110
Look also at the fact that
there's a barrel vault.

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.565
This is actually a wooden
vault, rather than a concrete

00:38:05.565 --> 00:38:07.230
vault here in this room.
 

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:11.045
But very nicely done,
and the walls are extensively

00:38:11.045 --> 00:38:11.809
painted.
 

00:38:11.809 --> 00:38:15.181
They are weathered today,
but they give you a very good

00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:18.927
sense of what would have been
the original appearance of this

00:38:18.927 --> 00:38:19.489
room.
 

00:38:19.489 --> 00:38:21.996
And, as I mentioned,
we'll talk in detail about

00:38:21.996 --> 00:38:24.123
Roman wall painting,
especially because,

00:38:24.123 --> 00:38:26.739
as you can see,
it does depict architecture.

00:38:26.739 --> 00:38:31.793
We'll begin that conversation
on Thursday and continue into

00:38:31.793 --> 00:38:32.840
next week.
 

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:37.143
I want to turn now to what is
surely the most important

00:38:37.143 --> 00:38:42.005
surviving house at the city of
Pompeii, and this is the famous

00:38:42.005 --> 00:38:43.760
House of the Faun.
 

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:47.072
If you're in Pompeii and you
only have time to see two

00:38:47.072 --> 00:38:50.887
houses, you go to the House of
the Vettii and the House of the

00:38:50.887 --> 00:38:51.449
Faun.
 

00:38:51.449 --> 00:38:53.938
The House of the Faun,
as you can see from your

00:38:53.938 --> 00:38:56.784
Monument List,
dates to the second century

00:38:56.784 --> 00:39:00.764
B.C., for the most part,
and we see a view,

00:39:00.764 --> 00:39:05.994
part of Pompeii over here,
with a series of houses marked

00:39:05.994 --> 00:39:06.699
in yellow.
 

00:39:06.699 --> 00:39:09.788
And the reason that I show this
to you is because the House of

00:39:09.788 --> 00:39:11.460
the Faun is particularly large.
 

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:15.773
You can see from this plan that
it takes up in fact the entire

00:39:15.773 --> 00:39:19.170
block,
an entire block of the city of

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:22.036
Pompeii,
and it is much larger than some

00:39:22.036 --> 00:39:22.980
of the others.
 

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.333
For example,
look at the House of the Vettii

00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:25.989
over here.
 

00:39:25.989 --> 00:39:30.309
It's twice, if not larger,
than that: twice the size of

00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:34.630
the House of the Vettii,
if not even more than that.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.809
So it's a very large house.
 

00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:41.733
Clearly no expense was spared,
either in accumulating the

00:39:41.733 --> 00:39:46.219
property, and also in enhancing
the décor of the house.

00:39:46.219 --> 00:39:48.889
If we look at a plan of the
House of the Faun,

00:39:48.889 --> 00:39:50.608
we will see,
without question,

00:39:50.608 --> 00:39:53.456
that it corresponds and it
follows the Hellenized

00:39:53.456 --> 00:39:54.880
domus type.
 

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.010
We enter over here.
 

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.170
We see it has a
vestibulum;

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:05.059
a fauces;
two cellae, one on either side;

00:40:05.059 --> 00:40:07.219
an atrium with an
impluvium;

00:40:07.219 --> 00:40:09.750
the cubicula here on
either side;

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:11.268
the wings or the alae.
 

00:40:11.268 --> 00:40:13.630
It does have a tablinum,
you see it over here,

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:17.780
and then it has two peristyle
courts,

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:21.981
with columns encircling them,
a smaller one and then a very

00:40:21.981 --> 00:40:23.719
large one in the back.
 

00:40:23.719 --> 00:40:27.378
Note also, while this is on the
screen, that there is a very

00:40:27.378 --> 00:40:30.170
interesting room that is located
over here.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.110
It's a rectangular room.
 

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:36.177
It has a couple of columns on
bases and pilasters,

00:40:36.177 --> 00:40:37.920
one on either side.
 

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.420
It opens right off the
peristyle court,

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:45.460
and on the floor of that space,
which we call the Alexander

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.349
exedra,
e-x-e-d-r-a,

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:51.429
after Alexander the Great,
because on the floor of that

00:40:51.429 --> 00:40:54.648
was the most famous mosaic that
we have surviving from

00:40:54.648 --> 00:40:57.090
antiquity,
that represents Alexander the

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:59.106
Great,
and I'll show you that

00:40:59.106 --> 00:41:00.039
momentarily.
 

00:41:00.039 --> 00:41:03.135
First let me show you what the
house looks like from the

00:41:03.135 --> 00:41:03.699
outside.
 

00:41:03.699 --> 00:41:04.670
It's well preserved.
 

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:07.987
It doesn't have its ceiling the
way the House of the Vettii

00:41:07.987 --> 00:41:10.789
does, but otherwise it's pretty
well preserved.

00:41:10.789 --> 00:41:12.940
We're looking down the street
on which it finds itself.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.719
You see the polygonal masonry
blocks.

00:41:14.719 --> 00:41:23.760
You see the sidewalks here as
well, and how modern they look.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.909
You see the stepping stones.
 

00:41:24.909 --> 00:41:28.768
And over here the façade
of the House of the Faun.

00:41:28.768 --> 00:41:31.889
You can see the entranceway,
and you can see that the

00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:35.429
entranceway has on either side a
pilaster, a pilaster with a

00:41:35.429 --> 00:41:37.170
Corinthian capital above.
 

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:40.010
And that's very important,
because it's announcing to us,

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:43.967
as did that ideal Hellenized
domus that I showed you

00:41:43.967 --> 00:41:46.289
before,
it's announcing to us that this

00:41:46.289 --> 00:41:48.413
is a patron,
this is an owner of this

00:41:48.413 --> 00:41:51.641
particular house who has
leanings toward things Greek and

00:41:51.641 --> 00:41:55.003
wants us to know that,
even before we have entered

00:41:55.003 --> 00:41:56.110
into the house.
 

00:41:56.110 --> 00:42:00.610
You go into the house and stand
in the vestibule.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:03.972
You will see that there is
still quite a bit of decoration

00:42:03.972 --> 00:42:04.679
preserved.
 

00:42:04.679 --> 00:42:08.505
The walls are painted with
blocks, what look like blocks of

00:42:08.505 --> 00:42:09.889
stone: an illusion.
 

00:42:09.889 --> 00:42:12.449
This is an example of First
Style wall painting;

00:42:12.449 --> 00:42:13.980
we're going to talk about that
on Thursday.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.260
And then up here a shrine is
still preserved,

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.675
a shrine that probably held
statues or statuettes of some of

00:42:20.675 --> 00:42:23.623
the household gods,
the revered gods for this

00:42:23.623 --> 00:42:24.159
family.
 

00:42:24.159 --> 00:42:27.271
This is an excellent view
because it shows us again how

00:42:27.271 --> 00:42:30.440
entering this house you would
stand in the vestibule;

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.268
you'd go from there into the
fauces,

00:42:33.268 --> 00:42:36.063
then into the atrium,
then into the peristyle that

00:42:36.063 --> 00:42:38.393
lay beyond --
the first smaller one and then

00:42:38.393 --> 00:42:39.719
the larger one after that.
 

00:42:39.719 --> 00:42:42.965
But it shows us again the point
that I've made so many times

00:42:42.965 --> 00:42:45.326
already,
just in this first part of the

00:42:45.326 --> 00:42:47.811
semester,
and that is this Roman interest

00:42:47.811 --> 00:42:49.119
in vista or panorama.
 

00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:52.972
They've set up a view from the
moment in which you enter the

00:42:52.972 --> 00:42:55.369
house,
a sequence of experiences from

00:42:55.369 --> 00:42:59.110
light to dark to light to dark,
but also a sequence of visual

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:02.733
experiences that make entering
this house and walking through

00:43:02.733 --> 00:43:05.329
this house an extraordinary
experience,

00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:07.510
one that they have helped
enhance.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.989
And you can also see again the
capitals here.

00:43:09.989 --> 00:43:12.599
Here's a view of the atrium as
it looks today.

00:43:12.599 --> 00:43:15.059
We are standing in front of the
impluvium.

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:18.909
In that impluvium is a
statuette in bronze of the

00:43:18.909 --> 00:43:21.920
Dancing Faun,
from which this house gets its

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.550
name.
 

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.121
The one that you see there now
is a copy and the original is in

00:43:26.121 --> 00:43:28.309
the Archaeological Museum in
Naples.

00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:31.730
This view also shows you the
way in which you had the series

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:35.637
of visual experiences,
from the fauces to the

00:43:35.637 --> 00:43:37.945
atrium,
and ultimately toward the

00:43:37.945 --> 00:43:41.592
peristyle with its wonderful
forest of columns done à

00:43:41.592 --> 00:43:44.730
la Grecque,
in the Greek style.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.239
Here's another interesting view.
 

00:43:46.239 --> 00:43:47.719
We're still in the atrium.
 

00:43:47.719 --> 00:43:49.570
You can see the Dancing Faun
right here.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:52.641
We're looking at the side wall;
if we're facing the Faun,

00:43:52.641 --> 00:43:53.880
this is the wall to the left.
 

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.864
This is very helpful because it
shows us exactly what the

00:43:57.864 --> 00:44:02.559
cubicula that opened off
the atrium would've looked like.

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:04.179
You can see that they were very
dark.

00:44:04.179 --> 00:44:06.393
Some of them had these tiny
slit windows,

00:44:06.393 --> 00:44:08.719
or perhaps slightly larger slit
windows.

00:44:08.719 --> 00:44:12.003
But for the most part they were
very dark -- again meant only as

00:44:12.003 --> 00:44:15.130
a place to sleep at night and to
be used for no other purpose

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:15.860
than that.
 

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.918
You can also see from this view
that this is a rubble wall that

00:44:19.918 --> 00:44:22.833
has been stuccoed over,
and that reliefs,

00:44:22.833 --> 00:44:26.050
painted different colors,
have been placed on that wall.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:29.900
This is an example of so-called
First Style Roman wall painting,

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.619
and we'll go into what that
was, define what that was,

00:44:32.619 --> 00:44:35.960
and discuss it in more detail
on Thursday.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.246
This is a wonderful restored
view of what the House of the

00:44:39.246 --> 00:44:42.590
Faun would've looked like when
all of its First Style Roman

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:46.130
wall painting was intact,
showing what it would've looked

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:49.751
like to stand in the atrium and
look back through what survived

00:44:49.751 --> 00:44:53.030
of the tablinum,
with these very large pilasters

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:55.291
again,
announcing the Greek leanings

00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:56.989
of this particular patron.
 

00:44:56.989 --> 00:45:00.418
And then the view toward the
peristyle, where you would also

00:45:00.418 --> 00:45:04.137
see the columns that looked like
they were very much in the Greek

00:45:04.137 --> 00:45:04.719
style.
 

00:45:04.719 --> 00:45:08.422
So here's clearly a person who
not only is building his home to

00:45:08.422 --> 00:45:11.590
correspond to the latest in
domestic architecture,

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:13.420
namely the Hellenized
domus type,

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:16.206
but who just wants to make that
point over and over and over

00:45:16.206 --> 00:45:19.954
again: that he's cultivated,
that he knows things Greek,

00:45:19.954 --> 00:45:25.119
and that he has the funds to be
able to incorporate those into

00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:26.219
his house.
 

00:45:26.219 --> 00:45:29.418
And indeed First Style wall
painting, as we'll find out when

00:45:29.418 --> 00:45:31.748
we discuss it,
is also a style that is based

00:45:31.748 --> 00:45:33.050
on Greek prototypes.
 

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:37.510
So another example of the Greek
elements in this building.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:41.579
What room do you think this is?
 

00:45:41.579 --> 00:45:43.699
Oh I didn't show you this on
the plan; I neglected to.

00:45:43.699 --> 00:45:45.130
But you can look at your
Monument List.

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:48.525
When you look at the plan,
you'll see that this house had

00:45:48.525 --> 00:45:51.320
more than one atrium;
it had two atria.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.010
And this is one of them.
 

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:58.141
It's a tetrastyle atrium,
because you can see there are

00:45:58.141 --> 00:46:02.134
four columns,
one around each corner of the

00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:04.130
impluvium.
 

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.659
So a house with two peristyles;
a house with two

00:46:06.659 --> 00:46:08.465
atriums,
and even one of the

00:46:08.465 --> 00:46:11.440
atriums has four columns,
as you can see here.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.059
And this one is also very
useful for the fact--

00:46:14.059 --> 00:46:16.271
one of you asked me a question,
when we were looking at the

00:46:16.271 --> 00:46:19.561
Basilica of Pompeii,
about why the columns looked

00:46:19.561 --> 00:46:22.648
the way they did--
I think it was you--and I

00:46:22.648 --> 00:46:25.771
mentioned that they were pieced,
and here you can see that very

00:46:25.771 --> 00:46:27.793
well,
these drums placed one on top

00:46:27.793 --> 00:46:28.518
of another.
 

00:46:28.518 --> 00:46:31.717
So that you can see over time
how easy it would be for some of

00:46:31.717 --> 00:46:33.920
those to fall off or become
dismantled,

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:37.063
and for us to be left with the
sort of thing that we're left

00:46:37.063 --> 00:46:39.780
with when we look at what
remains in the Basilica of

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:40.420
Pompeii.
 

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.530
Here's a view obviously of one
of the peristyles.

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:45.413
Here you also see something
interesting in terms of building

00:46:45.413 --> 00:46:46.000
technique.
 

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.920
The columns in Pompeii tend to
be either of local stone,

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.619
a local tufa,
or made of these tiles that

00:46:53.619 --> 00:46:57.068
look like bricks,
but then in either case

00:46:57.068 --> 00:46:59.099
stuccoed over,
white, fluted,

00:46:59.099 --> 00:47:01.199
to make them look,
once again,

00:47:01.199 --> 00:47:04.242
like they are marble columns:
the illusion that they are

00:47:04.242 --> 00:47:06.891
marble columns,
even though they are not,

00:47:06.891 --> 00:47:08.940
to underscore their Greekness.
 

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:14.835
This is a view of that exedra,
that Alexander exedra that I

00:47:14.835 --> 00:47:18.865
mentioned to you before,
that opens off the first

00:47:18.865 --> 00:47:22.239
peristyle,
with two columns on bases here.

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:24.880
Note the red at the bottom,
white at the top.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.920
Two pilasters painted red,
as you can see.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.144
And you can see the tourists
standing there,

00:47:30.144 --> 00:47:30.869
gazing down.
 

00:47:30.869 --> 00:47:32.969
They're gazing down at a copy.
 

00:47:32.969 --> 00:47:35.480
And this copy,
by the way, for a very long

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.543
time,
for as long as I remember going

00:47:37.543 --> 00:47:38.967
there,
except for this last time I was

00:47:38.967 --> 00:47:40.628
there,
there was nothing there,

00:47:40.628 --> 00:47:44.065
and I think most people had no
realization that this amazing

00:47:44.065 --> 00:47:46.280
mosaic originally was on the
floor.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.340
But they have a put a copy--the
mosaic is now in the Naples

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.768
Archaeological Museum,
long ago moved there.

00:47:51.768 --> 00:47:53.889
But they finally put a copy
down on the floor,

00:47:53.889 --> 00:47:56.849
so that--of the mosaic that was
there--

00:47:56.849 --> 00:48:00.018
so that people who visit the
House of the Faun realize,

00:48:00.018 --> 00:48:03.880
oh, this is where the Alexander
Mosaic was located,

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.266
which is particularly
important, because this is a

00:48:06.266 --> 00:48:08.751
view of the mosaic,
this extraordinary mosaic of

00:48:08.751 --> 00:48:11.436
Alexander the Great,
that's now in the Naples

00:48:11.436 --> 00:48:12.949
Archaeological Museum.
 

00:48:12.949 --> 00:48:15.369
And, of course,
you can see that they display

00:48:15.369 --> 00:48:18.780
it there as if it were a panel
picture, hanging on the wall.

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.163
But that is not how it was
displayed, or meant to be

00:48:21.163 --> 00:48:22.940
displayed, in the House of the
Faun.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.699
It was a floor pavement in the
House of the Faun.

00:48:25.699 --> 00:48:27.739
But look how nicely,
at least in the museum,

00:48:27.739 --> 00:48:30.626
they have recreated the
ambience by putting the columns

00:48:30.626 --> 00:48:33.228
and the pilasters--
they tried to recreate the

00:48:33.228 --> 00:48:36.010
sense of the exedra,
just as it is in the house.

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:38.630
It's just that they put the
mosaic in the wrong place;

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:40.159
it should be on the floor.
 

00:48:40.159 --> 00:48:41.740
Nonetheless,
you can see it's an

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.170
extraordinary work of art.
 

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:45.369
I'm not going to go into it in
great detail,

00:48:45.369 --> 00:48:49.079
but I did want to expose you to
it because it is so important

00:48:49.079 --> 00:48:51.769
and so magnificent,
and I also want to make

00:48:51.769 --> 00:48:53.969
absolutely sure that you don't
miss,

00:48:53.969 --> 00:48:58.056
when you go to the Pompeii
area, you do not miss going to

00:48:58.056 --> 00:49:00.829
the Archaeological Museum in
Naples.

00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:03.567
It's an amazing museum,
one of the greatest of all the

00:49:03.567 --> 00:49:06.518
museums in Italy,
and it has of course--almost

00:49:06.518 --> 00:49:10.632
all the great stuff that comes
from Pompeii is at that museum

00:49:10.632 --> 00:49:11.250
today.
 

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:14.610
So it's another one of those
asterisked, must-sees.

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:15.920
You look at it here.
 

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.635
It represents the battle
between Alexander and the

00:49:18.635 --> 00:49:20.840
Persian King Darius,
d-a-r-i-u-s,

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:26.023
at the famous Battle of Issus,
i-s-s-u-s, and at that battle

00:49:26.023 --> 00:49:31.159
Alexander was victorious,
and you see it here.

00:49:31.159 --> 00:49:34.407
And one of the reasons that
it's so important for our

00:49:34.407 --> 00:49:38.217
understanding of the House of
the Faun is that we believe that

00:49:38.217 --> 00:49:42.090
this mosaic was a copy of an
earlier lost Greek painting,

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:44.190
a Greek painting of this same
scene,

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:48.619
of Alexander and Darius,
done in around 300 B.C.

00:49:48.619 --> 00:49:52.550
by a Greek painter,
that was copied for this house

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:56.400
in mosaic, sometime in the
second century B.C.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.440
So it's another example of this
patron,

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:03.059
of this owner of the house,
who is so besotted with Greek

00:50:03.059 --> 00:50:06.615
art that he wants to have as
much of it around him as he

00:50:06.615 --> 00:50:10.195
possibly can,
and he clearly has the assets

00:50:10.195 --> 00:50:15.277
that enable him to commission a
mosaicist to make this amazing

00:50:15.277 --> 00:50:16.360
painting .
 

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.699
Now there are a lot of people
who talk about this mosaic,

00:50:19.699 --> 00:50:23.250
and they say,
"Well, you know,

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.659
it's such a pale reflection of
what the painting would've been,

00:50:25.659 --> 00:50:28.719
and it's a typical derivative,
Roman art.

00:50:28.719 --> 00:50:31.469
They had to look at Greek art
and derive from it.

00:50:31.469 --> 00:50:33.119
They couldn't come up with
anything on their own."

00:50:33.119 --> 00:50:36.340
But I would maintain that's
absolutely untrue,

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:39.597
and I would also maintain that
to do this kind of work in

00:50:39.597 --> 00:50:41.697
mosaic,
rather than paint,

00:50:41.697 --> 00:50:43.719
is much more difficult.
 

00:50:43.719 --> 00:50:47.322
This is a true tour de force,
to be able to create this kind

00:50:47.322 --> 00:50:51.679
of active battle scene,
with collapsing horses and with

00:50:51.679 --> 00:50:56.969
spears in the sky foreshortened,
and foreshortened weapons down

00:50:56.969 --> 00:50:57.420
here.
 

00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.599
This is an amazing thing to do
in mosaic,

00:50:59.599 --> 00:51:02.429
when you think of all of these
individual tesserae,

00:51:02.429 --> 00:51:07.059
these small stones,
multicolored stones,

00:51:07.059 --> 00:51:09.179
that had to be brought
together, placed in mortar,

00:51:09.179 --> 00:51:11.679
to create this amazing tableau.
 

00:51:11.679 --> 00:51:15.775
To me it seems like it is a
much, much greater feat to have

00:51:15.775 --> 00:51:18.884
to achieve that,
and to achieve it so well in

00:51:18.884 --> 00:51:20.650
mosaic than in paint.
 

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:22.780
Just quickly a couple of
details.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.579
Here's the one of Alexander
himself on his horse.

00:51:25.579 --> 00:51:28.704
It's an incredible
characterization of the great

00:51:28.704 --> 00:51:32.693
Hellenistic general and king,
and you see him on his favorite

00:51:32.693 --> 00:51:35.880
horse, Bucephalus here;
and I think it's a wonderful

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.768
characterization by this
particular,

00:51:37.768 --> 00:51:41.239
very talented mosaicist and his
workshop,

00:51:41.239 --> 00:51:45.360
to capture the relationship of
man and horse.

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.380
If you look at not only the
eyes, but also at the hair,

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.380
the hair of Alexander tousled,
flowing in the wind,

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:54.293
the mane of the horse,
so closely allied with one

00:51:54.293 --> 00:51:54.900
another.
 

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:58.005
The artist has really very
effectively captured that again,

00:51:58.005 --> 00:52:00.577
even just using these very
small pieces of stone,

00:52:00.577 --> 00:52:02.559
which you can see very well
here.

00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:06.250
Look at the way the shadows are
cast, even by that stone.

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:07.639
It's incredible.
 

00:52:07.639 --> 00:52:11.349
Here's the other detail that
I'm going to show you of Darius,

00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:12.400
in his chariot.
 

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.585
As you can see,
he's looking toward Alexander,

00:52:15.585 --> 00:52:18.769
he's mesmerized by the great
Hellenistic king,

00:52:18.769 --> 00:52:21.389
but he's at the same time
afraid.

00:52:21.389 --> 00:52:24.567
And he's beating a retreat,
because you can see that his

00:52:24.567 --> 00:52:26.820
driver has turned the chariot
around.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.552
He's whipping the horse and
he's heading in the other

00:52:29.552 --> 00:52:32.550
direction, away from Alexander,
as is this figure here.

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:35.525
We see his horse from the rear,
a real tour de force,

00:52:35.525 --> 00:52:36.670
depicting a horse.
 

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:39.717
But he too is looking at
Alexander, quite afraid,

00:52:39.717 --> 00:52:43.530
and his horse is also turning
to go off into the distance.

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:46.199
So capturing this very dramatic
moment.

00:52:46.199 --> 00:52:48.913
And to me the most wonderful
detail is this one,

00:52:48.913 --> 00:52:51.914
that you see down here,
which is a view of one of the

00:52:51.914 --> 00:52:55.452
fallen Persians;
the shield is falling over on

00:52:55.452 --> 00:53:00.545
him, but the shield is polished
to such a shine that he can see

00:53:00.545 --> 00:53:03.340
the reflection of his own face.
 

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.530
I have a detail to show you of
this.

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:09.393
He can see the reflection--you
see it here--of his own face in

00:53:09.393 --> 00:53:10.280
that shield.
 

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.039
And this view is particularly
good.

00:53:12.039 --> 00:53:15.530
I took this one very close up,
so that you could see the

00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:16.800
individual stones.
 

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.025
You don't--from a distance they
blend, but when you go up close

00:53:20.025 --> 00:53:22.469
you can really see,
oh yeah, that's a mosaic.

00:53:22.469 --> 00:53:24.820
And it's really an
extraordinary work of art.

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:28.286
A very quick question because--
Student:  How big are

00:53:28.286 --> 00:53:29.090
the stones?
 

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:30.349
Prof: They're very
small, they're very small,

00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:32.436
and the reason for that is in
large part so that they will

00:53:32.436 --> 00:53:34.798
blend ultimately,
and from a distance it will

00:53:34.798 --> 00:53:36.550
have the feel of a painting.
 

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.802
Certainly when it's on the
wall, probably less so when you

00:53:38.802 --> 00:53:41.262
stood and looked at it,
in its original location,

00:53:41.262 --> 00:53:44.704
because you'd be looking down
on it and you'd be closer to it

00:53:44.704 --> 00:53:45.449
than here.
 

00:53:45.449 --> 00:53:46.389
But it's an amazing work.
 

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:49.360
And again remember that
although the original painting,

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.268
done by the Greek painter,
was probably,

00:53:51.268 --> 00:53:54.222
did hang on a wall,
this one was meant as a floor

00:53:54.222 --> 00:53:57.623
mosaic in this house --
but again a testament to the

00:53:57.623 --> 00:54:00.420
Greek leanings of this
particular patron.

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:03.811
Now I also wanted to show
you--that's not the only mosaic

00:54:03.811 --> 00:54:04.599
in Pompeii.
 

00:54:04.599 --> 00:54:07.221
It's the greatest,
by far, and it's without

00:54:07.221 --> 00:54:08.818
question--
and I think everyone who

00:54:08.818 --> 00:54:10.268
studies this stuff would agree
with me,

00:54:10.268 --> 00:54:14.255
that it's the finest surviving
mosaic in the history of ancient

00:54:14.255 --> 00:54:15.670
Greek and Roman art.
 

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:18.398
But there are plenty of other
mosaics preserved,

00:54:18.398 --> 00:54:21.184
including at Pompeii,
and I want to show you just

00:54:21.184 --> 00:54:21.650
one.
 

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:24.143
It's mentioned underneath the
Alexander mosaic,

00:54:24.143 --> 00:54:26.800
on your Monument List,
because it's so beloved;

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.771
it's even more beloved by most
tourists to the site than the

00:54:29.771 --> 00:54:31.851
Alexander mosaic,
which after all you can't see

00:54:31.851 --> 00:54:33.713
on the site,
you have to see it in Naples,

00:54:33.713 --> 00:54:34.780
at least the original.
 

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.077
But this is the so-called Cave
Canem Mosaic,

00:54:38.077 --> 00:54:41.605
and it belongs to the House of
the Tragic Poet,

00:54:41.605 --> 00:54:45.440
a house that was put up between
62 and 79 A.D.

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.543
And you see what's meant to be
a very ferocious dog with his

00:54:48.543 --> 00:54:49.280
teeth bared.
 

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:52.119
This one is done much more
simply, in only three colors;

00:54:52.119 --> 00:54:55.166
mainly black and
white--tesserae or small

00:54:55.166 --> 00:54:56.666
stones;
t-e-s-s-e-r-a-e,

00:54:56.666 --> 00:54:59.246
that's what these small stones
are called, the

00:54:59.246 --> 00:55:02.800
tesserae--black and
white, basically black on white.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.858
But you can see that there's
one touch of red,

00:55:05.858 --> 00:55:07.489
the collar of the dog.
 

00:55:07.489 --> 00:55:09.797
And the dog is chained,
as you can see,

00:55:09.797 --> 00:55:13.382
just like that poor plaster
cast of the dog that we saw last

00:55:13.382 --> 00:55:14.780
time, he's chained.
 

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.760
But he's meant to look very
ferocious.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.780
He's baring his teeth.
 

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:21.018
And the whole point,
Cave Canem, beware of dog,

00:55:21.018 --> 00:55:24.394
is for you to be warned of the
fact that if you dare step any

00:55:24.394 --> 00:55:26.590
further than that
vestibulum,

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:29.456
and try to get into this house
or try to steal anything or

00:55:29.456 --> 00:55:31.518
whatever,
this dog will attack.

00:55:31.518 --> 00:55:35.237
So it's the same kind of--it's
like a security alarm system

00:55:35.237 --> 00:55:36.840
actually for antiquity.
 

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:41.503
And I bet you can tell me where
in the house this mosaic was

00:55:41.503 --> 00:55:42.135
located.
 

00:55:42.135 --> 00:55:45.139
Student:  The
fauces.

00:55:45.139 --> 00:55:46.315
Prof: In the
vestibulum or the

00:55:46.315 --> 00:55:47.110
fauces of the house.
 

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:48.670
Yes, probably the
vestibulum actually,

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:50.500
indeed the vestibulum of
the house,

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:53.824
so that even before you got in
as far as the fauces you

00:55:53.824 --> 00:55:56.550
were warned that you'd better
beware of the dog.

00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:58.690
And this thing,
you will see this--any of you

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:01.900
who've been to Pompeii know this
and can attest that I'm right--

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:06.250
every single souvenir stand,
anywhere within any numbers of

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:09.201
yards of Pompeii,
is selling the Cave Canem on

00:56:09.201 --> 00:56:11.690
everything you can possibly
imagine: the mugs,

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:13.798
the T-shirts,
the hotplates,

00:56:13.798 --> 00:56:15.840
the whatever,
the tote bags.

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.378
You can get the Cave Canem in
every shape, size and

00:56:19.378 --> 00:56:20.369
possibility.
 

00:56:20.369 --> 00:56:23.835
And I have one of those myself,
only one, only a hotplate,

00:56:23.835 --> 00:56:24.809
but that's it.
 

00:56:24.809 --> 00:56:28.590
I did it like everybody else at
one point, years ago.

00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:32.280
I want to show you briefly a
couple of other houses,

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:36.210
just to make a few small
points, well,

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:38.791
important points,
an important point or two about

00:56:38.791 --> 00:56:39.599
each of them.
 

00:56:39.599 --> 00:56:43.371
The first one is the House of
Menander, in Pompeii,

00:56:43.371 --> 00:56:46.389
which dates to the second
century B.C.

00:56:46.389 --> 00:56:47.119
and later.
 

00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:49.750
You see it in plan here.
 

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:52.496
The House of Menander,
like everything else we've seen

00:56:52.496 --> 00:56:55.088
in the latter part of this
lecture, is a Hellenized

00:56:55.088 --> 00:56:55.969
domus.
 

00:56:55.969 --> 00:56:59.050
You can tell that because of
the peristyle here.

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:01.414
In other respects it's very
similar to everything we've

00:57:01.414 --> 00:57:04.505
seen: the usual fauces,
atrium, cubiculum,

00:57:04.505 --> 00:57:08.335
tablinum system,
the large peristyle up here,

00:57:08.335 --> 00:57:12.320
and some dining spaces opening
off that peristyle.

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.500
What makes this particular
house interesting,

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:16.059
and the reason that I show it
to you,

00:57:16.059 --> 00:57:20.380
is it's a good illustration of
what happens when over time you

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:22.639
remodel,
and also over time,

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:26.219
when other property becomes
available nearby.

00:57:26.219 --> 00:57:30.206
And we can tell from this plan
that what happened here is that

00:57:30.206 --> 00:57:32.690
the core of the house was added
to,

00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:35.380
as property on either side,
additional property,

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:38.257
became available,
and this owner purchased that

00:57:38.257 --> 00:57:39.760
property and added it.
 

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.751
And the plan becomes much more
irregular obviously,

00:57:42.751 --> 00:57:43.829
because of that.
 

00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:46.320
An addition over here,
an addition over here;

00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:49.974
some of that sense of axiality
and symmetry is lost when you

00:57:49.974 --> 00:57:52.639
start to add to either side
horizontally.

00:57:52.639 --> 00:57:54.690
But there are lots of houses
like this,

00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:58.829
and it's one of the things one
needs to keep in mind as one

00:57:58.829 --> 00:58:03.039
visits the city and as one looks
at each of these incredible

00:58:03.039 --> 00:58:04.110
structures.
 

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:06.141
Just very quickly,
with regard to the house,

00:58:06.141 --> 00:58:08.739
just so you have a sense of
what it looks like today.

00:58:08.739 --> 00:58:11.518
It's named the House of
Menander because of this

00:58:11.518 --> 00:58:14.532
painting of the poet who sits on
a chair over there,

00:58:14.532 --> 00:58:16.719
on one of the walls of the
house.

00:58:16.719 --> 00:58:20.847
Part of the peristyle is
actually quite well preserved,

00:58:20.847 --> 00:58:22.300
as is the atrium.
 

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.853
We're standing in the atrium,
as you can obviously see,

00:58:24.853 --> 00:58:27.690
with the impluvium,
looking back toward the garden.

00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:30.764
This is interesting because you
can see again the

00:58:30.764 --> 00:58:33.518
cubicula opening off
either side,

00:58:33.518 --> 00:58:35.449
but also because of the
incorporation,

00:58:35.449 --> 00:58:39.170
just as in the House of the
Faun, of columns elsewhere than

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:40.710
just in the peristyle.
 

00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:47.150
These in that transition place
between the atrium and the

00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:50.454
garden,
the so-called tablinum

00:58:50.454 --> 00:58:52.719
space,
these very large columns,

00:58:52.719 --> 00:58:56.407
stuccoed over,
fluted, and you can see in this

00:58:56.407 --> 00:58:58.052
case,
not painted red at the bottom

00:58:58.052 --> 00:59:00.268
but a kind of bright yellow to
match the colors of the wall.

00:59:00.268 --> 00:59:04.132
So again this incorporation of
Greek elements into houses like

00:59:04.132 --> 00:59:04.829
this one.
 

00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:06.099
This is also a good view.
 

00:59:06.099 --> 00:59:07.320
It's a very well-preserved
house.

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.110
We're back in the atrium again.
 

00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:11.344
You can see the way in which
the cubicula,

00:59:11.344 --> 00:59:13.300
the small cubicula open
off that.

00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:14.679
You can see some of the
paintings.

00:59:14.679 --> 00:59:17.079
And here's the entranceway,
through the fauces,

00:59:17.079 --> 00:59:19.896
and you can see in this
particular case a small shrine

00:59:19.896 --> 00:59:22.851
that's located in the corner --
the purpose of that,

00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:25.800
for the household to display
the household gods.

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:29.025
This is another interesting
house that I just want to treat

00:59:29.025 --> 00:59:29.750
fleetingly.
 

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:32.958
It's the so-called House of
Pansa in Pompeii,

00:59:32.958 --> 00:59:35.949
and it dates to the second
century B.C.

00:59:35.949 --> 00:59:38.940
And it's a very large house,
as you can see,

00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:43.115
like all the other Hellenized
domuses, because we see that it

00:59:43.115 --> 00:59:45.760
has a peristyle with columns
here.

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:48.637
Like all the others it has
everything that we've seen:

00:59:48.637 --> 00:59:50.699
the vestibulum;
the fauces;

00:59:50.699 --> 00:59:52.110
the atrium;
the cubicula;

00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:54.007
the wings or alae;
the tablinum,

00:59:54.007 --> 00:59:59.059
a dining room;
and a bevy of shops down here.

00:59:59.059 --> 01:00:02.378
In fact more shops than we have
seen be the case in most of the

01:00:02.378 --> 01:00:04.869
houses we've looked at,
at least five,

01:00:04.869 --> 01:00:08.670
if not six shops down here,
which gives us something of a

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:11.610
clue to something that might be
going on in this house.

01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:14.873
If we go back to the peristyle
and we take a look at that,

01:00:14.873 --> 01:00:17.849
we see that there's a pool in
between the columns.

01:00:17.849 --> 01:00:19.699
And you might speculate,
"Oh how nice;

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.179
a nice pleasant pool.
 

01:00:21.179 --> 01:00:23.367
You could sit around,
you could dip your hands or

01:00:23.367 --> 01:00:26.000
your feet into that pool;
a nice pleasurable spot to

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:26.699
enjoy."
 

01:00:26.699 --> 01:00:28.550
Well actually it wasn't that at
all.

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:32.449
We think now that it was
probably a pool that held fish,

01:00:32.449 --> 01:00:34.481
and fish--not fish,
just attractive fish that one

01:00:34.481 --> 01:00:36.853
could admire,
but actually fish that were

01:00:36.853 --> 01:00:39.050
sold in one of the shops in
front.

01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:42.996
One of the reasons we believe
that is a scholar by the name of

01:00:42.996 --> 01:00:46.304
Wilhelmina Jashemski,
whose specialty is gardens of

01:00:46.304 --> 01:00:48.596
Pompeii,
has spent her whole scholarly

01:00:48.596 --> 01:00:50.188
career--
and it was well worth it

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:52.639
because she's come up with some
extraordinary things--

01:00:52.639 --> 01:00:56.469
on studying the root marks of
the gardens in Pompeii,

01:00:56.469 --> 01:00:58.500
and she's been able to
demonstrate,

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.184
through studying those and
working with experts on that

01:01:01.184 --> 01:01:03.262
sort of thing,
just what was grown in these

01:01:03.262 --> 01:01:03.659
gardens.
 

01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:06.143
And you find that some of them
were pleasure gardens with

01:01:06.143 --> 01:01:08.226
beautiful flowers,
and some of them were produce

01:01:08.226 --> 01:01:08.760
gardens.
 

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.099
And this one was a produce
garden, so that there would've

01:01:11.099 --> 01:01:12.768
been vegetables and fruits and
so on,

01:01:12.768 --> 01:01:17.355
that were gardened here and
then they were sold in the shops

01:01:17.355 --> 01:01:19.920
that were located at the front.
 

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.771
So here we see a wonderful
example of the way in which

01:01:23.771 --> 01:01:28.061
these houses could even be used
by some owners as a means of

01:01:28.061 --> 01:01:31.260
income for them and for their
families,

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:34.190
and that was surely the case
with the House of Pansa.

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.969
It also has a very
well-preserved peristyle.

01:01:36.969 --> 01:01:40.460
We can see the columns here
around that pool that was used

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.768
to hold the fish that were sold
in one of the shops.

01:01:43.768 --> 01:01:45.768
The columns are extremely well
preserved,

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:48.429
including some of the capitals,
Ionic capitals,

01:01:48.429 --> 01:01:50.280
as you can see here,
and the fluting,

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.969
and then the plain,
stuccoed over at the bottom,

01:01:52.969 --> 01:01:54.940
with the paint--you can see in
this case,

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:58.858
remains of the red paint that
would've decorated the bottom

01:01:58.858 --> 01:02:00.480
part of those columns.
 

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:06.371
Another very interesting house,
and one that's important for us

01:02:06.371 --> 01:02:11.123
because it marks a later
development in Roman house

01:02:11.123 --> 01:02:16.844
architecture in Pompeii,
is the House of Marcus Loreius

01:02:16.844 --> 01:02:18.030
Tiburtinus.
 

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:21.989
Remember Tibur was the ancient
word for Tivoli,

01:02:21.989 --> 01:02:25.065
and so it's likely that
Tiburtinus in fact came from

01:02:25.065 --> 01:02:26.750
Tivoli,
moved to Pompeii,

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:30.371
and built this large house
sometime between the earthquake

01:02:30.371 --> 01:02:35.579
and the eruption of Vesuvius,
so 62 to 79 A.D.

01:02:35.579 --> 01:02:39.652
Like the House of the Faun,
it took up an entire city

01:02:39.652 --> 01:02:40.280
block.
 

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.351
But you can see that the owner
has made a different decision

01:02:44.351 --> 01:02:47.320
than the owner of the House of
the Faun,

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.449
because the house itself takes
up very little space,

01:02:50.449 --> 01:02:53.849
and most of the space is taken
up by the garden.

01:02:53.849 --> 01:02:57.018
We're less sure here whether
this was a pleasurable garden--

01:02:57.018 --> 01:02:59.570
there are some indications that
it might have been--

01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:02.018
or whether it too was used as a
produce garden.

01:03:02.018 --> 01:03:04.253
We don't have all those shops
on the front,

01:03:04.253 --> 01:03:06.010
so that seems less likely here.
 

01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:09.235
But you can see it's another
example of the way in which

01:03:09.235 --> 01:03:12.518
these houses are becoming not
only more personalized,

01:03:12.518 --> 01:03:16.135
but also with much more
emphasis on the garden and on

01:03:16.135 --> 01:03:19.750
the dining rooms that are
surrounding that garden;

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:21.489
we see one of those dining
rooms here.

01:03:21.489 --> 01:03:23.750
What's particularly interesting
about this house,

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:27.456
and one that helps us round the
circle to where I began at the

01:03:27.456 --> 01:03:31.101
beginning of the lecture when I
talked about the fact that it

01:03:31.101 --> 01:03:34.806
was between 62 and 79 that the
Pompeians began to build second

01:03:34.806 --> 01:03:36.630
stories on their houses.
 

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:40.045
They began to expand
vertically, and we saw the

01:03:40.045 --> 01:03:44.130
cenaculae of the Via
dell'Abbondanza building.

01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:47.422
We see the same thing happening
here, that a second story has

01:03:47.422 --> 01:03:49.619
been added around the living
quarters.

01:03:49.619 --> 01:03:51.432
Now here it was obviously
really needed,

01:03:51.432 --> 01:03:53.804
because they weren't giving
much space to the living

01:03:53.804 --> 01:03:56.550
quarters, so they had to build
up vertically for those.

01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:58.289
And if you look very carefully
at the restored view,

01:03:58.289 --> 01:04:04.143
you will see that the windows
of that second story open off

01:04:04.143 --> 01:04:10.300
and look out over onto the
compluvium of the atrium.

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.898
You see that there,
the compluvium of the

01:04:11.898 --> 01:04:13.702
atrium,
and then around it you can see

01:04:13.702 --> 01:04:16.373
the second story,
with the windows looking out

01:04:16.373 --> 01:04:18.929
over the compluvium of
the house.

01:04:18.929 --> 01:04:20.882
Then the rest,
needless to say,

01:04:20.882 --> 01:04:21.469
garden.
 

01:04:21.469 --> 01:04:23.050
It's actually pretty well
preserved.

01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:24.250
It's fun to wander around.
 

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:27.913
You see these wonderful
trellises and all kinds of

01:04:27.913 --> 01:04:32.621
interesting architectural forms
that are part of this incredible

01:04:32.621 --> 01:04:35.869
garden,
in the House of Tiburtinus.

01:04:35.869 --> 01:04:38.840
And you even see there this
magnificent grotto,

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.280
which leads me to believe that
we're beginning to see something

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.777
interesting here,
which is the incorporation of

01:04:44.777 --> 01:04:47.599
the sorts of things that you
would tend to see in villas,

01:04:47.599 --> 01:04:51.429
not right in the center of a
city, but villas that were

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:55.190
located either outside the city
or along the coast.

01:04:55.190 --> 01:05:01.105
And the reason I say that here
is because we can see this

01:05:01.105 --> 01:05:05.289
grotto-like effect,
where we have what looks like a

01:05:05.289 --> 01:05:07.869
pebbled effect on the back wall:
painted,

01:05:07.869 --> 01:05:11.666
two columns,
Corinthian columns,

01:05:11.666 --> 01:05:16.005
with a pediment above,
and then these two wonderful

01:05:16.005 --> 01:05:17.099
mythological paintings.
 

01:05:17.099 --> 01:05:19.980
This one you probably recognize
as the Myth of Narcissus.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:22.449
You can see his reflection in
the water;

01:05:22.449 --> 01:05:25.061
he's admiring himself in his
reflection down below,

01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:27.150
and then Pyramus and Thisbe
over here.

01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:30.416
What's important to us is not
which myths, but just that Greek

01:05:30.416 --> 01:05:32.880
myths are incorporated into the
scheme here;

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.239
so this pretension toward
things Greek.

01:05:35.239 --> 01:05:38.427
But most important this
grotto-like element that you

01:05:38.427 --> 01:05:42.114
would tend to find in a villa
along the Amalfi Coast or some

01:05:42.114 --> 01:05:45.369
such,
rather than in downtown Pompeii.

01:05:45.369 --> 01:05:48.130
So we're beginning to see this
interesting merging,

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:50.592
at least for the very
well-to-do, the rich and famous

01:05:50.592 --> 01:05:52.065
as we--
the lifestyles of the rich and

01:05:52.065 --> 01:05:55.090
famous,
as this lecture is called;

01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:58.690
we begin to see that in some of
the houses, especially in the

01:05:58.690 --> 01:05:59.590
later period.
 

01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:05.373
The second to last building
that I want to show you is an

01:06:05.373 --> 01:06:09.347
extremely important one;
the last one we'll just look at

01:06:09.347 --> 01:06:10.179
for a minute or so.
 

01:06:10.179 --> 01:06:13.070
But this one is an extremely
important building.

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:16.099
It is the Villa of the
Mysteries, in Pompeii.

01:06:16.099 --> 01:06:18.869
It is indeed a villa.
 

01:06:18.869 --> 01:06:22.690
So it's a nice segue from the
Loreius Tiburtinus House.

01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:25.469
What started to happen in
Pompeii,

01:06:25.469 --> 01:06:27.518
even though there was quite a
bit of space initially,

01:06:27.518 --> 01:06:29.619
as time went on things became
more crowded,

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:33.789
and the really well-to-do began
to move outside the city,

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:35.304
to the suburbs,
so to speak,

01:06:35.304 --> 01:06:37.867
right outside the city --
interestingly enough,

01:06:37.867 --> 01:06:40.860
right along those same streets
that formed the cemeteries,

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:41.869
of the city.
 

01:06:41.869 --> 01:06:45.128
So we see the villas and the
cemeteries intermixing in a very

01:06:45.128 --> 01:06:45.889
natural way.
 

01:06:45.889 --> 01:06:49.849
But this very important villa
was part of that development.

01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:53.050
And I want to say--it went
through a couple of phases,

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:55.768
and I want to show you the two
phases here.

01:06:55.768 --> 01:06:57.806
Only Phase Two is on your
Monument List,

01:06:57.806 --> 01:07:00.155
so I won't hold you responsible
for Phase One,

01:07:00.155 --> 01:07:03.340
but I think it's important for
us to look at it together.

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:06.480
Because what we see here is
something very interesting.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.231
Looking at the top,
we see the entrance into the

01:07:10.231 --> 01:07:10.869
villa.
 

01:07:10.869 --> 01:07:12.994
We see the peristyle there,
the atrium there,

01:07:12.994 --> 01:07:14.539
and the tablinum there.
 

01:07:14.539 --> 01:07:17.480
Now what do you think about
that?

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.880
It's very strange.
 

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.255
We've never seen a house or
villa that departed from the

01:07:22.255 --> 01:07:24.590
scheme that we talked about
before,

01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:27.000
from this movement from the
entranceway,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.489
the fauces,
into the peristyle first,

01:07:29.489 --> 01:07:32.389
then into the atrium,
then into the tablinum.

01:07:32.389 --> 01:07:33.690
It's a different progression.
 

01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:36.643
We might think to ourselves,
well this must be the whim of

01:07:36.643 --> 01:07:38.974
this particular patron,
but Vitruvius tells us

01:07:38.974 --> 01:07:39.699
otherwise.
 

01:07:39.699 --> 01:07:41.889
Vitruvius tells us about villa
design,

01:07:41.889 --> 01:07:45.353
and he tells us the major
distinction between Roman villas

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:47.980
and Roman houses,
in terms of their plan,

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:51.659
is that in Roman villas you
enter into the peristyle first.

01:07:51.659 --> 01:07:54.960
So it shows again the growing
interest in peristyles.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.239
And yet this peristyle,
very, very early indeed,

01:07:58.239 --> 01:08:00.570
because it belongs to the first
phase,

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:06.659
which is even before the early
second century B.C.,

01:08:06.659 --> 01:08:11.530
which is when the second phase
is dated.

01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:15.382
We can also see here a great
podium, and I'll say a bit more

01:08:15.382 --> 01:08:18.189
about the podium as we look at
Phase Two.

01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:20.881
This is Phase Two of the house,
and this is the one that you

01:08:20.881 --> 01:08:23.708
have--the villa--this is the one
that you have on your Monument

01:08:23.708 --> 01:08:24.118
List.
 

01:08:24.118 --> 01:08:27.430
The main spaces are labeled
here.

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:29.399
You can see the entranceway;
the fauces;

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:32.189
the peristyle first,
a very large peristyle;

01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:36.229
the atrium of the house here;
the tablinum over here.

01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:38.948
So this different order
described by Vitruvius.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:41.800
We can see also that it rests
on a tall podium.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.800
I'll show you what it looks
like in a moment.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:47.024
It is a podium that looks
exactly like the podia we saw

01:08:47.024 --> 01:08:50.189
for the great sanctuaries at
Tivoli and Palestrina.

01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:52.850
We see that underneath that
podium,

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:55.140
just as at those -- or Jupiter
Anxur at Terracina,

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:58.461
just as at Terracina -- we see
there's a cryptoporticus

01:08:58.461 --> 01:09:01.140
or underground passageway,
underneath that podium.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:05.463
It is barrel vaulted,
and the concrete is faced with

01:09:05.463 --> 01:09:09.703
opus incertum work,
just as we saw it in the

01:09:09.703 --> 01:09:11.060
sanctuaries.
 

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.050
Why have this kind of podium
here?

01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:16.868
To give the villa an even
grander appearance,

01:09:16.868 --> 01:09:18.948
to put it up high on top of a
podium,

01:09:18.948 --> 01:09:24.680
and also to help to muffle the
sounds from the street--

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.019
remember, this is a major
street, a thoroughfare that's

01:09:28.019 --> 01:09:31.420
just left the city and has
become an intercity road--

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:34.630
to muffle the sounds that one
would hear from that,

01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:37.310
by raising the villa in a sense
away from them.

01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:40.479
The most important point though
that I can make about this

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:42.161
villa,
and something that speaks to

01:09:42.161 --> 01:09:43.854
the future,
is the fact that we are

01:09:43.854 --> 01:09:46.972
beginning to see--
we've talked about how enclosed

01:09:46.972 --> 01:09:51.600
and plain and severe the earlier
exteriors of Roman houses were,

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.189
even up through the Hellenized
domus,

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.498
except perhaps for the addition
of a pilaster or a column here

01:09:56.498 --> 01:09:57.149
and there.
 

01:09:57.149 --> 01:09:59.430
Here we see something entirely
new happening.

01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:05.078
We see that the architect has
designed these elements that

01:10:05.078 --> 01:10:09.636
project out of the rectangle of
the villa plan,

01:10:09.636 --> 01:10:12.951
and are curved;
and you can see one over here,

01:10:12.951 --> 01:10:14.670
and most importantly one over
here.

01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:21.287
It's like a giant bay window,
with views that can be seen

01:10:21.287 --> 01:10:24.359
through that bay window.
 

01:10:24.359 --> 01:10:28.408
So this projecting out into the
viewer's space and so on,

01:10:28.408 --> 01:10:31.465
and also into the space of
those who live inside this

01:10:31.465 --> 01:10:34.068
building,
offer wonderful panoramas and

01:10:34.068 --> 01:10:35.770
vistas of the sea beyond.
 

01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:39.118
The sea was closer to Pompeii
at that point than it actually

01:10:39.118 --> 01:10:41.729
is today: beautiful views out
onto the sea,

01:10:41.729 --> 01:10:46.686
and in a sense the exterior of
the structure breaking out of

01:10:46.686 --> 01:10:51.309
its rectangular bonds to do
something entirely different

01:10:51.309 --> 01:10:53.828
from what has come before.
 

01:10:53.828 --> 01:10:56.913
This is a restored view of what
that structure would've looked

01:10:56.913 --> 01:10:59.529
like in its second phase,
and I think you can see that

01:10:59.529 --> 01:11:02.060
very well here,
resting on this tall podium.

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:04.560
Arcades, just as at the
sanctuaries;

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.430
these are blind arcades,
just as we saw there.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:09.920
Concrete opus
incertum facing.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.770
But look at the difference that
having this bay window has made.

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.470
They've opened up the wall.
 

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:16.590
The windows are very large.
 

01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:17.630
No more slit windows.
 

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:20.368
Big panoramic windows,
projecting elements,

01:11:20.368 --> 01:11:24.150
also with very large windows,
there's hardly any wall there

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:25.130
whatsoever.
 

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:26.368
The rest is the same.
 

01:11:26.368 --> 01:11:28.130
The compluvium,
the peristyle,

01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:30.868
all look like they did in the
Hellenized domus.

01:11:30.868 --> 01:11:35.597
But this is a big change and
one that looks forward again to

01:11:35.597 --> 01:11:36.640
the future.
 

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.413
This is a view of it as it
looks today: the Villa of the

01:11:39.413 --> 01:11:40.020
Mysteries.
 

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:42.788
You can see the great podium
over here, with its blind

01:11:42.788 --> 01:11:44.880
arcades, as well as part of the
house.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.899
And look at how open that house
is.

01:11:46.899 --> 01:11:48.488
Now part of this is villas.
 

01:11:48.488 --> 01:11:51.997
There's more of a desire when
you build a villa to open it up,

01:11:51.997 --> 01:11:53.779
more so than a house in town.
 

01:11:53.779 --> 01:11:56.578
But it's also an important
development for architecture as

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:57.069
a whole.
 

01:11:57.069 --> 01:11:59.868
This is a view of the peristyle
court.

01:11:59.868 --> 01:12:02.369
It's a little different than
any other peristyle court we've

01:12:02.369 --> 01:12:04.989
seen,
because you can see they have

01:12:04.989 --> 01:12:08.449
embedded the columns into the
wall of the--

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:12.775
there's a wall around;
the columns are embedded into

01:12:12.775 --> 01:12:14.520
that, which is a different
motif.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.005
And I thought you'd be amused
to see that the Villa of the

01:12:18.005 --> 01:12:21.207
Mysteries is one of those --
and there are several places in

01:12:21.207 --> 01:12:22.724
Italy,
many places in Italy,

01:12:22.724 --> 01:12:25.328
where people go in particular
to take photos,

01:12:25.328 --> 01:12:28.328
after their wedding,
to take photos of themselves:

01:12:28.328 --> 01:12:29.430
photo-op places.
 

01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:32.130
And the Villa of the Mysteries
is one of them.

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:34.567
So don't be at all surprised,
if you are there,

01:12:34.567 --> 01:12:37.216
especially on a weekend,
if you see a wedding party

01:12:37.216 --> 01:12:38.170
taking photos.
 

01:12:38.170 --> 01:12:40.500
And this was one of the more
discreet photos.

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:43.814
You can just imagine the kinds
of poses that people take in

01:12:43.814 --> 01:12:44.899
places like this.
 

01:12:44.899 --> 01:12:47.551
I could've shown you all kinds
of very amusing,

01:12:47.551 --> 01:12:50.090
very loving photos of the bride
and groom.

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:52.890
But here you just get a sense
of the photographer,

01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:54.940
and there were several
photographers the day I took

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:57.734
this,
getting wonderful images of

01:12:57.734 --> 01:13:01.750
this bride and groom after the
happy event.

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:04.371
I just want to close,
just very briefly,

01:13:04.371 --> 01:13:07.664
with this last house,
or this mosaic fountain from

01:13:07.664 --> 01:13:09.010
this last house.
 

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:11.456
It's the so-called House of the
Large Fountain,

01:13:11.456 --> 01:13:14.434
so-called because of this
extraordinary fountain that was

01:13:14.434 --> 01:13:16.189
found there and still exists.
 

01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:20.520
Dates to between the earthquake
the eruption of Vesuvius,

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.680
62 to 79 A.D.
 

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.060
It's very well preserved.
 

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:25.229
You see it here on the
right-hand side of the screen.

01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:28.578
It shows you that mosaics could
be applied to any kind of

01:13:28.578 --> 01:13:31.090
surface by these very talented
artists,

01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:34.698
in this case applied to a
curved surface,

01:13:34.698 --> 01:13:37.957
as you can see very well here,
once again using multi-colored

01:13:37.957 --> 01:13:41.069
tesserae,
as we saw in the Alexander

01:13:41.069 --> 01:13:41.710
mosaic.
 

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:44.556
And you can only imagine how
lovely it was when there was

01:13:44.556 --> 01:13:46.488
actually a water display and so
on,

01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:50.851
in fact, so lovely that it was
imitated almost exactly for the

01:13:50.851 --> 01:13:53.720
Getty Villa in Malibu,
which I show you on the

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.130
left-hand side of the screen.
 

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:56.948
Many of you have probably been
there.

01:13:56.948 --> 01:13:59.000
The Getty Villa--it looks like
Disneyland I know,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.259
but it probably gives you a
better sense of what a Roman

01:14:02.259 --> 01:14:05.399
villa looked like in antiquity
than anything else,

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:08.429
even that you can see in Rome,
because it's in such pristine

01:14:08.429 --> 01:14:08.840
shape.
 

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:12.335
And it really gives you--it is
based, for any of you who don't

01:14:12.335 --> 01:14:15.886
know, it is actually based on a
villa from Herculaneum that was

01:14:15.886 --> 01:14:16.689
excavated.
 

01:14:16.689 --> 01:14:17.750
We know it.
 

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:20.380
It's based very closely on it,
the so-called Villa of the

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.817
Papyri,
at Herculaneum,

01:14:21.817 --> 01:14:24.849
and then it picks and chooses--
it looks at other things as

01:14:24.849 --> 01:14:27.193
well and incorporates them,
as it incorporated this

01:14:27.193 --> 01:14:27.760
fountain.
 

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.828
But it probably gives you--it's
in better condition.

01:14:29.828 --> 01:14:32.701
You can see that the water
display is actually working,

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:34.189
unlike the one in Pompeii.
 

01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:37.551
So it gives you a very good
sense of what this thing would

01:14:37.551 --> 01:14:39.439
have looked like in antiquity.
 

01:14:39.439 --> 01:14:43.037
And just as a look forward,
one of the paper topics for

01:14:43.037 --> 01:14:47.368
this course actually is to talk
about the Villa of the Papyri,

01:14:47.368 --> 01:14:49.815
in the context,
in part, and being helped by

01:14:49.815 --> 01:14:52.149
the reconstruction at the Getty
Museum.

01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:55.198
On Thursday we will move on to
Herculaneum.

01:14:55.198 --> 01:14:57.448
We will talk about the lives of
the people there,

01:14:57.448 --> 01:15:01.216
some of the houses that were
built there between the

01:15:01.216 --> 01:15:04.878
earthquake and Vesuvius,
and we will also begin our

01:15:04.878 --> 01:15:08.538
conversation about First Style
and Second Style Roman wall

01:15:08.538 --> 01:15:09.310
painting.
 

01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:11.868
We'll have a few lectures on
painting,

01:15:11.868 --> 01:15:15.912
because it's so important as
the interior decoration of these

01:15:15.912 --> 01:15:16.975
homes,
and because,

01:15:16.975 --> 01:15:18.500
as we'll see,
it depicts architecture--

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.260
and you can get a sense of that
here--

01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:23.908
in ways that are very
intriguing and that tell us even

01:15:23.908 --> 01:15:26.939
more about buildings than we
already know.

01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:27.909
Thanks everybody.
 

01:15:27.909 --> 01:15:29.430
Have a good morning.

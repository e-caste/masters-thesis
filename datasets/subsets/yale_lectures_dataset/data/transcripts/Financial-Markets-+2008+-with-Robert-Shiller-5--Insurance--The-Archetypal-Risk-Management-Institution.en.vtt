00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.647
Professor Robert Shiller:
I wanted to talk today

00:00:05.647 --> 00:00:07.885
about insurance,
which is another risk

00:00:07.885 --> 00:00:10.971
management device that's
traditionally separate from

00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:13.631
securities,
which we talked about last

00:00:13.631 --> 00:00:16.770
time, but the underlying
principles are the same.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.282
Before I begin,
I want to just give some more

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:25.487
thoughts about the
diversification through

00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:30.820
securities and that will lead us
into insurance.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.793
Let me just review the
preceding lecture briefly for

00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:40.306
that purpose.
What we did--the core

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:44.905
theoretical framework that we
had--was the mean variance

00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:49.840
theory, which led us to the
capital asset pricing model.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.907
But the basic thing was that we
had to--in order to use the

00:00:54.907 --> 00:00:59.712
framework--we had to start by
producing estimates of the

00:00:59.712 --> 00:01:04.591
expected returns on each asset,
we called those r,

00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:09.036
and the standard deviation of
the return on each asset and the

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:13.189
covariance between the returns
of each pair of assets.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.696
Then, once we did that we could
plug that into the formula that

00:01:16.696 --> 00:01:19.919
I gave you last time and get the
standard deviation of the

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:23.030
portfolio and the expected
return on the portfolio.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.924
From then on,
if you accept the analysis and

00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:29.223
the assumptions or the estimates
that underlie it,

00:01:29.223 --> 00:01:33.060
then we pretty much know how to
construct portfolios.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.158
The underlying estimates may
not accord with your belief or

00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:43.260
your intuitive sense of common
sense.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.100
The other thing that I
mentioned last time was that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.786
there seems to be a really big
difference between the expected

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:55.780
return on the stock market and
the expected return on

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.885
short-term debt.
We found an equity premium--or

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:04.635
actually Jeremy Siegel's book
gave an equity premium of 4% a

00:02:04.635 --> 00:02:07.386
year.
Some people find that hard to

00:02:07.386 --> 00:02:10.415
believe.
How can it be that one asset

00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:13.469
does 4% a year better than
another?

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.975
Some people say,
well if that's the case I want

00:02:15.975 --> 00:02:18.590
to invest in nothing more than
that one asset.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.250
Why should I take something
that is underperforming?

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.250
Jeremy Siegel goes on further
to say that since the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.889
mid-nineteenth century we've
never had a thirty-year period

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.930
when stocks under performed
bonds,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.914
so stocks are really--if anyone
who has an investment horizon of

00:02:38.914 --> 00:02:43.060
thirty years--you'd think,
why should I ever holds bonds.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.782
The numbers that Jeremy Siegel
produces seem implausibly high

00:02:49.782 --> 00:02:55.646
for the stock market.
What we call this is the--I

00:02:55.646 --> 00:03:01.367
want to emphasize it,
I'll write this again--the

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:09.321
equity premium puzzle.
That term was actually coined

00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:15.250
by economists,
Prescott and Mehra;

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.737
it's now in general use.
That is, it just seems that

00:03:21.737 --> 00:03:24.750
stocks so much outperform other
investments.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.364
For Jeremy Siegel,
in the latest edition of his

00:03:29.364 --> 00:03:34.479
book, the equity premium is 4% a
year since 1802.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:41.590
That's almost--no that's more
than 100--that's 206 years.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.139
Why would that be and can you
believe that?

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:50.629
One question that comes up is
that maybe--this is for the U.S.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.996
data--and some people say,
well, maybe,

00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:58.400
why are we looking at the U.S.?
Because the U.S.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.166
is an arguably very successful
country, so we have,

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:08.318
potentially,
a bias in--it's called a

00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:13.234
selection bias.
If you pick as the country you

00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:18.410
study one of the most successful
countries in the world,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:26.925
that doesn't inform you very
well about what it is for a

00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:32.623
random country or for the U.S.
going forward,

00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:34.800
there's something wrong.
The U.S.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.619
has been successful in
financial markets and it's being

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:41.296
imitated by lots of countries.
Financial markets similar to

00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:44.019
ours are being set up in many
places.

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.029
You wonder, you know,
maybe they're over imitating;

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:51.220
maybe we were just lucky or
maybe it was because the U.S.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.052
was the first,
in some ways,

00:04:54.052 --> 00:04:59.716
to develop some of these
financial institutions--or one

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.952
of the first.
But now, when more and more

00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:05.910
countries start doing it,
maybe it won't work so well.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.943
One way of investigating this
is--to get around the selection

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:14.550
bias--is to try to look at all
countries.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.300
Let's not just look at the
United States;

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.477
let's look at every country of
the world and let's see if they

00:05:21.477 --> 00:05:26.438
have an equity premium.
There's a problem with that and

00:05:26.438 --> 00:05:31.841
the problem is that countries
that are less successful don't

00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:36.313
keep data--that's a problem.
Or they--sometimes they just

00:05:36.313 --> 00:05:38.940
shut down their stock markets at
some point.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:46.587
This is since 1802--now how
many countries do you think have

00:05:46.587 --> 00:05:52.420
uninterrupted stock market data
since 1802?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.771
What do you think?
Name another country that

00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:59.690
probably has it.
What's that?

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.309
England, UK?
If you go onto the continent,

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:11.173
though, they tended to be
interrupted by World War I and

00:06:11.173 --> 00:06:13.835
World War II.
What about Japan,

00:06:13.835 --> 00:06:15.870
do they have--do you think they
have uninterrupted?

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.538
They had a little bit of a
problem around World War II and

00:06:20.538 --> 00:06:24.762
you can try to bridge the gap,
but--anyway,

00:06:24.762 --> 00:06:31.439
there are people who have tried
to sort this out.

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:35.164
There's one,
it's a book by Dimson,

00:06:35.164 --> 00:06:38.779
Marsh, &amp;
Staunton that--called

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:43.489
Triumph of the
Optimists--that Jeremy

00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:47.707
Siegel quotes.
He has a table in the new,

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:53.720
fourth edition of his book.
Dimson, Marsh and Staunton look

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.910
at the following countries:
Belgium, Italy,

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.091
Germany,
France, Spain,

00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:03.205
Japan, Switzerland,
Ireland, Denmark,

00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:04.790
Netherlands,
UK, Canada,

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.259
U.S., South Africa,
Australia, and Sweden.

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:11.040
Every one of them has a
positive equity premium;

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.099
although the U.S.
is on the high side of them

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:16.983
all, it's not the best.
The country that has the

00:07:16.983 --> 00:07:20.056
highest equity premium--and
that's for the whole twentieth

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:23.019
century,
they couldn't go back to

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:28.646
1802--the most successful
country is Sweden and after that

00:07:28.646 --> 00:07:30.486
Australia.
U.S.

00:07:30.486 --> 00:07:38.421
is not the most successful
stock market although it's high

00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:42.988
on the list.
Jeremy Siegel concludes that

00:07:42.988 --> 00:07:48.209
there's--that the equity--he
said that these--that this book

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:51.985
by Dimson,
Marsh and Staunton puts to bed

00:07:51.985 --> 00:07:57.147
any concerns about selection
bias and he claims that so many

00:07:57.147 --> 00:08:01.697
countries have shown an equity
premium that we can be

00:08:01.697 --> 00:08:04.839
confident.
His book is really very strong

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:07.210
on the conclusions.
The title of the book,

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.510
Stocks for the Long
Run--stocks always

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.699
outperform other investments for
the long run and he says it's

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:15.912
not due to selection bias.
You know, I kind of wonder,

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.565
the list of countries that I
just read to you,

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:20.858
that Dimson,
Marsh and Staunton studied,

00:08:20.858 --> 00:08:23.310
excludes some important
countries, doesn't it?

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.576
Who does it exclude?
Well, it doesn't have India,

00:08:27.576 --> 00:08:30.490
Russia, and China in it,
for example.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.532
At least Russia and China--do
you know anything about their

00:08:34.532 --> 00:08:36.865
history?
They have any stock market

00:08:36.865 --> 00:08:39.570
disruptions in the last one
hundred years?

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.716
That's kind of obvious.
They had a communist revolution

00:08:43.716 --> 00:08:45.620
in both places,
right?

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:52.724
Russia and China are not
mentioned by--or not studied by

00:08:52.724 --> 00:08:56.970
Dimson, Marsh and Staunton.
Why not?

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.250
Well, they can't get data,
there wasn't a stock market.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.751
Well there actually was a stock
market in Russia before 1918 and

00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:07.610
in China before 1949,
so what happened to investors?

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:12.284
If you were a Chinese investor
in Chinese stocks in 1949,

00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:15.860
what happened?
We know what happened.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.898
It went--that's that famous
minus 100% return,

00:09:18.898 --> 00:09:21.330
right, which dominates
everything.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:28.894
I think--what would Siegel say?
He's really saying that this

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:32.690
equity premium is enduring and
we should believe it.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.264
I don't know,
I think that--I think what

00:09:36.264 --> 00:09:40.572
Jeremy would say is,
well you're looking--if you

00:09:40.572 --> 00:09:44.771
look at Russia and China,
you're looking at political

00:09:44.771 --> 00:09:48.309
factors and I'm only looking at
politically stable countries,

00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:51.330
so this whole thing is
irrelevant.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.480
Really, we're not going to have
a communist revolution in any of

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.517
these advanced countries now.
So Jeremy would say,

00:09:57.517 --> 00:10:00.565
forget that,
it looks pretty sound that we

00:10:00.565 --> 00:10:04.059
have an equity premium so we can
trust that.

00:10:04.059 --> 00:10:08.412
Well, he's a good friend of
mine, but I think he may be

00:10:08.412 --> 00:10:12.549
overstating it a little bit;
we have some disagreements.

00:10:12.549 --> 00:10:17.840
The thing that comes to my mind
is that--I want to say before

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.042
concluding this review of the
last lecture--that is that the

00:10:23.042 --> 00:10:27.980
stock market is inherently
political in any country.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:34.150
Politics have tremendous
effects on the values in the

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:40.913
stock market and that's because
of--even if the government

00:10:40.913 --> 00:10:48.270
doesn't nationalize the stock
market or confiscate assets,

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.127
they tax them.
Do you know we have,

00:10:52.127 --> 00:10:55.430
in the U.S.,
a corporate profits tax?

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.194
Well, it's not just in the
U.S., essentially every--I don't

00:11:07.194 --> 00:11:11.602
know if there's any exception.
There may not be an exception,

00:11:11.602 --> 00:11:16.727
but essentially every country
has a corporate profits tax and

00:11:16.727 --> 00:11:20.400
then we also have a personal
income tax.

00:11:25.379 --> 00:11:29.785
The corporate profits tax goes
after the profits that

00:11:29.785 --> 00:11:33.498
corporations make.
The personal--it's taken from

00:11:33.498 --> 00:11:36.980
corporations before they pay out
their dividends.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.539
The personal income tax is
levied on individuals and these

00:11:41.539 --> 00:11:46.638
individuals have to pay it.
The personal income tax is not

00:11:46.638 --> 00:11:48.757
simple;
it's not just a flat rate on

00:11:48.757 --> 00:11:51.070
your income, it depends on the
type of income.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:55.316
Dividend income or capital
gains income in the stock market

00:11:55.316 --> 00:11:59.308
is taxed differently.
The interesting thing is that

00:11:59.308 --> 00:12:02.411
through time,
as political winds change,

00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:06.868
these taxes have changed and
they've gone up to some very

00:12:06.868 --> 00:12:11.087
high levels in the past in the
United States and other

00:12:11.087 --> 00:12:15.210
countries.
I'm going to give some U.S.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.550
tax rates.
The personal tax on

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:26.251
dividends--of course it depends
also on your tax bracket and

00:12:26.251 --> 00:12:29.289
your income;
I'm going to talk about the

00:12:29.289 --> 00:12:31.815
highest tax bracket.
In the U.S.,

00:12:31.815 --> 00:12:40.100
it went over 90% in World War
II and the succeeding years.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.640
The government was taking 90%
of your dividend income.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.509
What is it today?
Does anyone know?

00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:50.620
What's the tax rate of
dividends today?

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:56.815
It might be zero for some
people, but it's actually--it

00:12:56.815 --> 00:13:03.928
is--the standard rate for people
who have not negligible income

00:13:03.928 --> 00:13:09.400
is 15%.
It's gone down from over 90% to

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.269
15%.
Why did it do that?

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:15.876
Well, it's some kind of
political change and the

00:13:15.876 --> 00:13:20.973
corporate–incidentally,
at the beginning of the

00:13:20.973 --> 00:13:24.600
twentieth century you were
right.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.269
Who said zero?
We didn't even have income tax

00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:32.409
until 1913 when the Supreme
Court allowed it,

00:13:32.409 --> 00:13:35.341
so it was zero,
then it went up to 90%--or

00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:39.559
actually it was 94% at the
peak--and it came down to 15%.

00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:42.080
That's a pretty big hit on the
stock market.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.259
So, it wasn't just China that
took the stock market.

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:48.961
When we were taking 90% of
dividends that was 90% of the

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.990
stock market being taken by the
government;

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.271
but that's not all because we
were also taxing the

00:13:54.271 --> 00:13:57.163
corporations.
In the early post-war period,

00:13:57.163 --> 00:14:01.551
the corporate--now I'm going to
talk--there's a distinction

00:14:01.551 --> 00:14:05.636
between the rate that they
charge and the actual amount

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:09.655
that they take.
Most advanced countries of the

00:14:09.655 --> 00:14:14.164
world today have a corporate
profits tax rate for large

00:14:14.164 --> 00:14:18.373
corporations of about a third.
So they--a typical advanced

00:14:18.373 --> 00:14:21.548
country takes a third of the
profits, the government takes a

00:14:21.548 --> 00:14:24.547
third of the profits.
That's not the actual amount

00:14:24.547 --> 00:14:28.205
that they pay because the tax
law is so complicated and there

00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:31.602
are so many loopholes.
What I looked at--and I have

00:14:31.602 --> 00:14:34.410
this on the website,
I have a chart showing

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:38.152
corporate profits taxes paid,
as a fraction of corporate

00:14:38.152 --> 00:14:40.740
profits for the United States
since 1929.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.524
That has moved around a lot,
but it got almost up to 60% in

00:14:45.524 --> 00:14:50.475
the post-World War II period and
now it's down to less than a

00:14:50.475 --> 00:14:54.090
third.
Why is it down?

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:57.241
It's because they're changing
enforcement of the taxes and

00:14:57.241 --> 00:15:01.186
changing amounts of loopholes,
so most countries have a tax

00:15:01.186 --> 00:15:04.996
rate of about a third,
but corporations are paying

00:15:04.996 --> 00:15:08.649
less than a third of their
profits to taxes.

00:15:08.649 --> 00:15:12.784
If we want to look going
forward at the equity premium,

00:15:12.784 --> 00:15:16.460
we have to know how
much--what's the politics?

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.519
And what's the government going
to do in the future?

00:15:18.519 --> 00:15:21.707
They've moved these tax rates
around a lot,

00:15:21.707 --> 00:15:26.185
so I think that it's very hard
to be sure that we know going

00:15:26.185 --> 00:15:29.825
forward what are σ,
the expected return,

00:15:29.825 --> 00:15:33.917
the standard deviation of
returns and the covariance of

00:15:33.917 --> 00:15:37.198
returns--are really.
We have a nice theoretical

00:15:37.198 --> 00:15:40.631
framework, but the application
of the framework to the real

00:15:40.631 --> 00:15:44.360
data is hard and it ends up with
politics underneath it all;

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:51.145
that's just the real world.
I want to say one more thing

00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:57.230
about the diversification and
the mutual fund.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:01.508
Ideally, mutual funds are
calculating r and σ

00:16:01.508 --> 00:16:06.015
and σ_12 and
plugging in and finding what the

00:16:06.015 --> 00:16:09.529
optimal portfolio that you
should hold is,

00:16:09.529 --> 00:16:12.649
then offering that to you in
their mutual fund.

00:16:12.649 --> 00:16:15.818
Firms that do that are,
in practice,

00:16:15.818 --> 00:16:21.251
however, the minority and most
mutual funds have some gimmick

00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:26.230
or some special--they claim to
be beating the market not

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:32.638
forming the optimal portfolio.
I also have up on the website

00:16:32.638 --> 00:16:38.934
some questions that I asked
investors about what they think

00:16:38.934 --> 00:16:42.792
about picking stocks.
Picking stocks means trying to

00:16:42.792 --> 00:16:44.669
find a stock that's going to do
really well.

00:16:44.669 --> 00:16:50.942
What I found--the question I
asked is, do you agree--which of

00:16:50.942 --> 00:16:56.273
the following is a correct
answer to this statement:

00:16:56.273 --> 00:17:01.452
Trying to time the market,
to get out before it goes down

00:17:01.452 --> 00:17:05.060
and in before it goes up is (a)
a smart thing to do,

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:10.594
or (b) not a smart thing to do?
Most people think that it's not

00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:13.420
a smart thing to do--to try to
time the market.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:18.160
Only 11% said yes to that.
But then I asked another

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.930
question, do you think trying to
pick mutual funds,

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:26.238
trying to find a mutual fund
that will beat the market is a

00:17:26.238 --> 00:17:29.730
smart thing to do or not a smart
thing to do?

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.650
Most people think it's a smart
thing to do.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.213
What I think the mutual fund
industry has turned into,

00:17:36.213 --> 00:17:39.710
largely, is a stock picking
industry, not a portfolio

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:43.536
diversification industry.
What most people are doing when

00:17:43.536 --> 00:17:46.986
they go into a mutual fund is
they're trying to find smart

00:17:46.986 --> 00:17:50.074
people who will beat the
market--who will pick those

00:17:50.074 --> 00:17:54.005
stocks that will do well.
The mutual fund theory that we

00:17:54.005 --> 00:17:57.249
gave last time said,
no the mutual fund is just

00:17:57.249 --> 00:18:00.000
supposed to be diversifying for
you.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.799
In fact, the truth is somewhere
in between.

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:09.832
Most mutual funds are providing
some diversification service and

00:18:09.832 --> 00:18:14.410
they're also trying to beat the
market.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:19.013
Finally, I just want to say
that I've been talking mainly

00:18:19.013 --> 00:18:22.384
about the U.S.,
but mutual funds have been

00:18:22.384 --> 00:18:25.920
growing in importance around the
world.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:33.758
There was a recent paper by
Khorana, Servaes,

00:18:33.758 --> 00:18:43.734
and Tufano, that looked at what
it is that explains which

00:18:43.734 --> 00:18:54.779
countries have had rapidly
growing mutual fund industries.

00:18:54.779 --> 00:18:58.770
They found, not surprisingly,
that it tends to--mutual funds

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.897
have been growing more rapidly
in countries that have stronger

00:19:02.897 --> 00:19:05.400
securities laws and
institutions,

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.339
especially laws that protect
individual shareholders rights.

00:19:10.339 --> 00:19:14.138
Also, mutual funds have been
growing more in countries that

00:19:14.138 --> 00:19:18.200
have higher level of education
and a higher level of wealth.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.206
They also grow more in
countries that have

00:19:22.206 --> 00:19:27.875
institutional structures that
encourage investing in mutual

00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:32.918
funds, such as pension plans.
I think it's a trend around the

00:19:32.918 --> 00:19:36.496
world that we're going to see
more and more mutual funds and I

00:19:36.496 --> 00:19:39.680
think it's a good thing.
I think they will help us to

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.096
diversify our risks.
Anyway, I want then to move on

00:19:44.096 --> 00:19:49.779
to the topic of today's lecture,
which is insurance.

00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:57.735
Insurance is the other side of
the risk management institutions

00:19:57.735 --> 00:20:02.870
that we have.
Insurance evolves separately

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:06.444
from securities.
It's long been a different

00:20:06.444 --> 00:20:09.130
industry, but the principles are
the same.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.028
The principles of
insurance--the fundamental

00:20:13.028 --> 00:20:17.289
powerhouse--is the principle of
risk pooling.

00:20:17.289 --> 00:20:21.163
Insurers, just like mutual
funds, are providing risk

00:20:21.163 --> 00:20:24.948
pooling for you.
Risk pooling means they put a

00:20:24.948 --> 00:20:29.869
lot of people with independent
or low-correlated risk into a

00:20:29.869 --> 00:20:33.789
pool and reduce the risk for the
whole pool.

00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:39.512
They have to contend with
something called moral hazard,

00:20:39.512 --> 00:20:45.443
which is the risk that people
will be affected by the fact

00:20:45.443 --> 00:20:50.230
that they're insured and do
something bad.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.948
The classic moral hazard
problem is the problem that you

00:20:53.948 --> 00:20:58.140
give fire insurance on a house
and someone burns down the house

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.710
in order to collect the
insurance.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:07.420
They also have to deal with
selection bias.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.687
What this means in the
insurance context is that if you

00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:16.349
offer insurance policies you
will tend to attract people who

00:21:16.349 --> 00:21:19.700
are higher risk.
If you offer life insurance,

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.493
you have life tables which give
you probabilities of dying at

00:21:23.493 --> 00:21:25.958
various ages,
but that's for the general

00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:28.824
population.
All the sick people will come

00:21:28.824 --> 00:21:32.662
to you to buy life insurance and
they will turn out to have a

00:21:32.662 --> 00:21:35.859
higher death rate than the
population at large.

00:21:35.859 --> 00:21:40.330
These are the problems of
insurance that we have to deal

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:44.012
with.
I just want to review the

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:49.174
mathematics of insurance.
This is actually just,

00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:54.337
in part, just a review of what
we talked about in the second

00:21:54.337 --> 00:21:58.574
lecture.
In the ideal world,

00:21:58.574 --> 00:22:07.537
if you have independent risks,
under the independence

00:22:07.537 --> 00:22:12.724
assumption,
the probability distribution

00:22:12.724 --> 00:22:18.470
for the number of insurance
contracts that you will have to

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:22.829
pay on follows the binomial
distribution.

00:22:22.829 --> 00:22:30.851
x is the number of
accidents--let's say this is

00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:39.782
some accident insurance--the
probability of having--n

00:22:39.782 --> 00:22:47.349
is the number of policies that
you're writing.

00:22:47.349 --> 00:22:53.306
If you're going to have
p as the probability of

00:22:53.306 --> 00:22:59.600
an accident, then the binomial
distribution gives you the

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:06.344
probability of having x
accidents out of your n

00:23:06.344 --> 00:23:13.343
policies.
We had that before,

00:23:13.343 --> 00:23:24.530
that is p^(x)(1-
p)^((n-x))

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:37.069
n!/(x!
(n - x)!) That is

00:23:37.069 --> 00:23:44.967
the binomial distribution and it
allows you to calculate the

00:23:44.967 --> 00:23:50.589
probability of any number of
accidents.

00:23:50.589 --> 00:24:05.398
The mean proportion--The mean
of x/n, is equal to

00:24:05.398 --> 00:24:11.213
p.
If x is the number of

00:24:11.213 --> 00:24:17.428
accidents, the mean number of
accidents divided by your number

00:24:17.428 --> 00:24:22.319
of policies is given just by the
probability,

00:24:22.319 --> 00:24:31.763
but the standard deviation of
x/n is equal to

00:24:31.763 --> 00:24:41.369
the square root of p(1
– p)/n.

00:24:41.369 --> 00:24:54.922
That is the--that gives you the
mean and standard deviation of

00:24:54.922 --> 00:25:01.821
the proportion.
To actually apply this it helps

00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:07.461
to go to something called the
normal approximation to the

00:25:07.461 --> 00:25:14.031
binomial,
because it's kind of difficult

00:25:14.031 --> 00:25:21.314
to compute this formula.
There's an easier formula and

00:25:21.314 --> 00:25:27.039
you assume that the binomial
distribution is really a normal

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:31.309
distribution with a
mean–I'm sorry,

00:25:31.309 --> 00:25:35.625
the proportion of accidents
x/n follows a

00:25:35.625 --> 00:25:40.421
normal distribution with mean
p and standard deviation

00:25:40.421 --> 00:25:46.923
given by this.
That's the whole theory that I

00:25:46.923 --> 00:25:49.670
have here;
it's simple.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:56.599
Maybe I should make a
bigger--let me do it here,

00:25:56.599 --> 00:26:04.309
I can fit it in here I think.
I'm going to draw an example.

00:26:04.309 --> 00:26:06.530
I've got it plotted out and
it's on the website,

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:13.039
but it's a very simple example.
I have the case where p

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:20.960
= .2, so the probability of an
accident is 20%.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.410
This is a significantly high
probability of accidents.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:31.269
Can you see this?
Let's do this from 0 to .4.

00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:37.178
If you wrote only one policy,
what's the probability

00:26:37.178 --> 00:26:41.349
distribution of
x/n?

00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:43.640
Well, it has two possible
values.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.683
It could be the one person
doesn't have the accident or

00:26:45.683 --> 00:26:53.557
does have the accident.
So, if n = 1 we have an

00:26:53.557 --> 00:27:05.334
80% chance of no accident
and--let's make this 1 not

00:27:05.334 --> 00:27:16.880
.4--then a 20% chance of
x/n = 1.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:22.195
I'm plotting--this is the
probability of various values of

00:27:22.195 --> 00:27:25.258
x/n.
If n = 1,

00:27:25.258 --> 00:27:28.630
x/n can take on
only two values:

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:31.291
0 or 1.
It takes on the value 1 with

00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:35.457
the probability of 20% and the
value of 0 with the probability

00:27:35.457 --> 00:27:37.755
of 80%.
I didn't use the normal

00:27:37.755 --> 00:27:41.617
approximation there--that's
obvious--I used the binomial

00:27:41.617 --> 00:27:45.378
itself.
Let's go to the case where

00:27:45.378 --> 00:27:56.759
n = 100.
You can see this okay?

00:27:56.759 --> 00:28:01.688
Then, if n = 100--now
I'm going to label this x

00:28:01.688 --> 00:28:06.287
differently, I'm now going to
show the normal bell-shaped

00:28:06.287 --> 00:28:10.230
curve and I'm going to do this
from 0 to .4.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.798
Maybe I do have to make this
bigger--can you see this all

00:28:12.798 --> 00:28:21.445
right back there?
0 to .4, so .2 is here in the

00:28:21.445 --> 00:28:25.910
middle;
that's .2.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:31.900
For n = --now I'm going
to do n = 100.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:37.357
What is the mean?
Well, the mean is always .2 no

00:28:37.357 --> 00:28:40.720
matter how many policies you
write, so it's going to

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.940
be--we're going to have a normal
distribution centered on .2.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.990
This .2 is not very readable
here.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:03.731
What is the standard deviation?
It's the square root of (.2 x

00:29:03.731 --> 00:29:12.000
.8)/100.
So that's .16/100;

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.540
so the standard deviation is
.04.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:26.043
What does the curve look like?
It's a bell-shaped curve that

00:29:26.043 --> 00:29:28.520
looks about like that.

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:37.130
I didn't draw that very well,
let's do it again.

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.158
I should be able to do nice
bell-shaped curves,

00:29:39.158 --> 00:29:41.319
but it's harder than it looks
standing up here;

00:29:41.319 --> 00:29:47.430
so that's your bell-shaped
curve.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:51.007
With 100 policies,
they can't really count that

00:29:51.007 --> 00:29:54.740
accurately on having 20% of the
policies paid.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.588
There's still substantial
insurance risk because the--it

00:29:59.588 --> 00:30:04.702
could easily be only 15% or it
could be 25% of the policies

00:30:04.702 --> 00:30:08.547
that end up paying.
So, the insurance company with

00:30:08.547 --> 00:30:11.940
one hundred policies would have
still substantial risk.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.611
It's much better--the
uncertainty about

00:30:14.611 --> 00:30:19.039
x/n is much lower
for the case n = 100 than

00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:21.640
it was for the case n =
1,

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:27.840
but it's still there.
Now, I want to draw--what if we

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:33.730
write 10,000 policies?
What is the probability

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:38.119
distribution for
x/n in that case?

00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:43.229
Well, you can see you're going
to be dividing not by a hundred

00:30:43.229 --> 00:30:48.422
here, but by a hundred times a
hundred, so it's going to reduce

00:30:48.422 --> 00:30:52.633
this from .04 to .004.
So the normal--the bell-shaped

00:30:52.633 --> 00:30:56.361
curve in that case for the
x/n is going to

00:30:56.361 --> 00:31:00.320
look something like this.
I've got it plotted here;

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:05.650
it's even more steep than that.
That's a bell-shaped curve,

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:09.880
but it's centered exactly on
.2.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:14.185
Number of policies doesn't
affect the means but it affects

00:31:14.185 --> 00:31:18.068
that standard deviation,
so it becomes very collapsed

00:31:18.068 --> 00:31:21.220
and this is the basic core idea
of insurance.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:25.048
You have to be a big company to
do it and if you have a big

00:31:25.048 --> 00:31:28.480
company you've exhausted the
risk of--never goes away

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.980
completely.
If we did a--if we go another

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:38.065
two decimals--if we did a
million policies,

00:31:38.065 --> 00:31:44.723
then we would--this would
almost just be a spike here at

00:31:44.723 --> 00:31:48.113
that point,
so that's the concept of

00:31:48.113 --> 00:31:51.696
insurance.
The idea really took root--the

00:31:51.696 --> 00:31:57.723
idea, the intuitive idea is that
as you write a large number of

00:31:57.723 --> 00:32:01.697
policies,
the fraction that will result

00:32:01.697 --> 00:32:07.798
in accidents becomes closer and
closer to the probability of one

00:32:07.798 --> 00:32:11.751
accident.
That's an idea that struck

00:32:11.751 --> 00:32:16.689
people intuitively at various
times in history,

00:32:16.689 --> 00:32:22.380
but they didn't know how to do
these calculations.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:28.579
Historians of probability have
noted that--this basic idea is

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:32.323
actually in Aristotle,
the ancient Greek

00:32:32.323 --> 00:32:35.593
philosopher-scientist,
and I'm going to quote

00:32:35.593 --> 00:32:39.660
Aristotle from his book,
De Cielo.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:43.376
He says--he's talking very
generally here but I think it's

00:32:43.376 --> 00:32:45.920
just--he's really talking about
this.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.337
He says, "to succeed in many
things or many times is

00:32:50.337 --> 00:32:52.770
'difficult.'
For instance,

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:57.745
to repeat the same throw of
dice 10,000 times would be

00:32:57.745 --> 00:33:00.651
impossible;
whereas, to make it once or

00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:04.069
twice is comparatively easy."
That's Aristotle talking.

00:33:04.069 --> 00:33:06.885
It's exactly this theory,
but he doesn't have the word

00:33:06.885 --> 00:33:09.329
probability, which hadn't been
invented yet.

00:33:09.329 --> 00:33:12.663
So, he's using intuitive--he
says difficult or easy--so he

00:33:12.663 --> 00:33:15.876
says it's difficult,
meaning the probability is very

00:33:15.876 --> 00:33:18.362
low, or easy,
meaning that probability is

00:33:18.362 --> 00:33:20.277
high.
He had the idea but he didn't

00:33:20.277 --> 00:33:22.856
have the math.
I think that may be the

00:33:22.856 --> 00:33:27.029
first-known statement of the
binomial distribution.

00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:29.845
Well, it doesn't get very
precise but it has the intuitive

00:33:29.845 --> 00:33:33.479
concept.
The idea of using this theory

00:33:33.479 --> 00:33:37.592
for insurance,
it's--the earliest-known

00:33:37.592 --> 00:33:44.412
statement of it is a--was in an
anonymous letter written in 1609

00:33:44.412 --> 00:33:48.959
to Count Oldenburg;
but that's not the person who

00:33:48.959 --> 00:33:52.589
said it, that was the person who
received the letter.

00:33:52.589 --> 00:33:57.098
Anyway, the person wrote--he
was talking about fires and was

00:33:57.098 --> 00:34:01.607
proposing that people should pay
1% of the value of the home

00:34:01.607 --> 00:34:05.886
every year into a fund and then
the fund would be used to

00:34:05.886 --> 00:34:09.019
replace the home if it burned
down.

00:34:09.019 --> 00:34:12.376
Quoting this anonymous person
writing in 1609,

00:34:12.376 --> 00:34:16.179
"There is no doubt that it
would be fully proved,

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:20.288
if a calculation were made of
the number of houses consumed by

00:34:20.288 --> 00:34:24.329
fire within a certain space in
the course of thirty years,

00:34:24.329 --> 00:34:27.146
that the loss would not amount,
by a good deal,

00:34:27.146 --> 00:34:30.269
to the sum that would be
collected in that time."

00:34:30.269 --> 00:34:32.853
It's interesting that this
person uses the word

00:34:32.853 --> 00:34:35.596
calculation;
this person has the idea--this

00:34:35.596 --> 00:34:39.247
was--1600 was around the year
when probability theory was

00:34:39.247 --> 00:34:42.052
invented.
So, someone had the idea of

00:34:42.052 --> 00:34:46.323
going beyond the intuitive
notion that Aristotle mentioned

00:34:46.323 --> 00:34:49.769
and moving to something that is
calculable.

00:34:49.769 --> 00:34:52.340
That's when the insurance
industry was really born.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:59.579
Insurance relies on this theory
of risk pooling but it has to

00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:04.045
make it work.
I stressed in the third lecture

00:35:04.045 --> 00:35:08.757
that like any--insurance,
like any other risk management

00:35:08.757 --> 00:35:15.100
device, is an invention.
Every risk management device

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:23.017
relies on a design and the
design is usually complex and

00:35:23.017 --> 00:35:28.199
has--it all has to work
together.

00:35:28.199 --> 00:35:32.163
In order for a design to work
well we have to have every

00:35:32.163 --> 00:35:35.500
component there.
If one component is missing we

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:40.642
may have a failure.
All these components have to be

00:35:40.642 --> 00:35:47.842
compatible with each other and
it has to work according to a

00:35:47.842 --> 00:35:54.309
plan, which ultimately is
informed by this theory.

00:35:54.309 --> 00:36:07.579
Insurance as an invention has
to have what things?

00:36:07.579 --> 00:36:11.599
It has to have a contract
design;

00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:17.376
that would be a document,
which is a contract between the

00:36:17.376 --> 00:36:21.090
insured and the insurance
company.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.289
It specifies--what does it
specify?

00:36:24.289 --> 00:36:30.891
It specifies what risks are
covered, exclusions--some risks

00:36:30.891 --> 00:36:36.098
are not covered.
Those exclusions are carefully

00:36:36.098 --> 00:36:41.889
designed in regard to moral
hazard and selection bias.

00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:46.769
There has to be the
mathematical model,

00:36:46.769 --> 00:36:54.090
which I just presented,
but it may be more complicated.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:58.070
There has to be a form for the
company.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:02.558
There could be a corporate form.
There's the insurance company,

00:37:02.558 --> 00:37:07.591
could be a corporation and it
could be either a non-profit

00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:11.740
corporation or a for-profit
corporation owned by

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.373
shareholders.
Or the insurance company could

00:37:15.373 --> 00:37:19.255
be a mutual insurance company,
in which case the insurance

00:37:19.255 --> 00:37:23.395
company is owned by the insured.
Then you need,

00:37:23.395 --> 00:37:30.921
as well--you need government
regulation because the insurance

00:37:30.921 --> 00:37:36.440
companies don't seem to exist
without it.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.623
There have to be regulators
that are at least verifying that

00:37:40.623 --> 00:37:45.090
the insurance company is doing
what it says it's going to do.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:50.933
One thing that the government
has to do is reassure that

00:37:50.933 --> 00:37:57.124
reserves' requirements are met.
The company has to have enough

00:37:57.124 --> 00:38:01.510
money on hand to pay out in the
case of default.

00:38:07.329 --> 00:38:18.587
One way of classifying
insurance companies is that they

00:38:18.587 --> 00:38:31.096
can exist as either multiline
insurance companies or monoline

00:38:31.096 --> 00:38:38.914
insurance companies.
A multiline insurance company

00:38:38.914 --> 00:38:44.447
insures many different kinds of
things and doesn't confine

00:38:44.447 --> 00:38:48.494
itself to one thing.
If a company were just a fire

00:38:48.494 --> 00:38:52.250
insurance company it would be a
monoline insurance company.

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:56.981
They're essentially more risky
and more--regulators have to

00:38:56.981 --> 00:39:00.978
watch them more because they're
standing at higher

00:39:00.978 --> 00:39:05.219
probability--a monoline--of some
major disaster.

00:39:05.219 --> 00:39:13.621
In contrast,
a multiline kind of insures

00:39:13.621 --> 00:39:17.761
itself.
We hear a lot about monoline

00:39:17.761 --> 00:39:21.300
insurance companies in the
newspapers today.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.095
I don't know if you were
reading about the subprime

00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:26.219
crisis, but we are living in a
time,

00:39:26.219 --> 00:39:30.189
at this moment,
of a financial crisis called

00:39:30.189 --> 00:39:34.906
the subprime crisis.
That naturally hits monoline

00:39:34.906 --> 00:39:40.471
insurance companies more than
multiline insurance companies

00:39:40.471 --> 00:39:45.940
because they are more
specialized and more vulnerable.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:50.780
I'll come back to this
distinction in a minute.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:59.260
I want to talk about certain
kinds of monoline insurance

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:07.895
companies that--the biggest--one
category is property and

00:40:07.895 --> 00:40:12.074
casualty.
These are insurance--or

00:40:12.074 --> 00:40:17.650
P&amp;C--these are insurance
companies that insure the value

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:21.809
of a home or a business or an
automobile.

00:40:21.809 --> 00:40:27.496
Another kind of monoline
insurance is health insurance

00:40:27.496 --> 00:40:33.719
company that merely insures
people against health costs,

00:40:33.719 --> 00:40:39.420
and another important category
is life insurance.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:48.126
Life insurance is--what it
insures is a beneficiary against

00:40:48.126 --> 00:40:54.736
the death of an insured.
The classic example--the most

00:40:54.736 --> 00:41:00.436
important example is families.
You would buy life insurance on

00:41:00.436 --> 00:41:05.144
both the husband and the
wife--you might do different

00:41:05.144 --> 00:41:07.622
amounts;
it's done by families with

00:41:07.622 --> 00:41:11.158
young children to protect them
against the economic cost of the

00:41:11.158 --> 00:41:15.812
death of one of their parents.
You need insurance on both

00:41:15.812 --> 00:41:22.423
parents because both parents are
contributing to the success of

00:41:22.423 --> 00:41:27.190
the children.
These are big industries.

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:38.025
The total assets of property
and casualty in 2007 in the

00:41:38.025 --> 00:41:48.270
United States--and these are
assets--the property and

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:59.303
casualty was $1.4 trillion
dollars and life insurance was

00:41:59.303 --> 00:42:07.265
$4.9 trillion dollars.
Somehow I've missed getting the

00:42:07.265 --> 00:42:11.130
health, but that would be
another big insurance.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:21.039
These are hugely important
institutions in our society.

00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:24.860
What our--what does--let me go
to property and casualty.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:30.572
What do they insure?
Actually, the most important

00:42:30.572 --> 00:42:34.470
things that they insure are
automobiles.

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:41.301
The total of the premia
collected on automobiles is

00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:44.138
about--is much bigger,
like five times bigger,

00:42:44.138 --> 00:42:47.290
than of the premia they collect
on homeowners.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:55.119
Automobile insurance is
collision insurance;

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:58.056
homeowners insurance
is–it used to be called

00:42:58.056 --> 00:43:01.651
fire insurance but now they've
extended it to include so many

00:43:01.651 --> 00:43:04.165
other risks.
It depends on the particular

00:43:04.165 --> 00:43:07.159
policy--what it includes.
It might include risks,

00:43:07.159 --> 00:43:11.335
as well, of personal liability
if someone injures themselves on

00:43:11.335 --> 00:43:13.760
your property or risks of
storms,

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.532
of hurricanes,
earthquakes,

00:43:15.532 --> 00:43:17.912
everything else;
so we call it homeowners'

00:43:17.912 --> 00:43:20.260
insurance.
Actually, the automobile

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:24.860
insurance is more important than
the homeowners' insurance,

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.353
even though homes are so much
more valuable,

00:43:27.353 --> 00:43:30.948
because--I think that's because
cars move and they drive around

00:43:30.948 --> 00:43:37.098
and they bump into each other.
Homes just stay where they are,

00:43:37.098 --> 00:43:45.456
so we have far fewer accidents,
so they don't have to charge as

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:50.309
high a premium for the
insurance.

00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:55.882
These insurance contracts have
come across gradually through

00:43:55.882 --> 00:44:01.550
time as we develop the theory
and--I'll talk about the growth

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:06.840
of insurance and about some of
the components of it.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:28.288
The real insurance industry,
as I mentioned before,

00:44:28.288 --> 00:44:33.065
began in the 1600s with the
invention of probability theory

00:44:33.065 --> 00:44:37.843
and with the invention of life
tables for--the invention of

00:44:37.843 --> 00:44:42.369
actuarial science;
but, it grew slowly.

00:44:42.369 --> 00:44:46.084
I think the reason that it grew
slowly was that insurance is a

00:44:46.084 --> 00:44:49.917
very sophisticated concept.
In order to explain it--I had

00:44:49.917 --> 00:44:53.624
to write down the binomial
distribution to explain it

00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:55.453
properly.
For most people,

00:44:55.453 --> 00:44:58.435
that's a difficult concept
and--I think I may have

00:44:58.435 --> 00:45:02.269
mentioned some of this before,
but let me give this history.

00:45:02.269 --> 00:45:09.087
Insurance was invented in the
1600s but it did not proliferate

00:45:09.087 --> 00:45:13.670
fast, it proliferated only very
slowly.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:19.092
Some of the important
figures--there had to be certain

00:45:19.092 --> 00:45:24.224
inventions to make it work.
Again, I'm repeating a theme

00:45:24.224 --> 00:45:27.779
that is in my book,
New Financial Order,

00:45:27.779 --> 00:45:31.876
that financial innovation and
insurance innovation are

00:45:31.876 --> 00:45:36.514
successions of inventions and
each invention propels the idea

00:45:36.514 --> 00:45:40.022
more forward.
It's like we have laws of

00:45:40.022 --> 00:45:43.711
thermodynamics that underlie the
use of engines,

00:45:43.711 --> 00:45:48.264
but you can't just go from the
laws of thermodynamics to an

00:45:48.264 --> 00:45:51.193
automobile;
there are a million steps along

00:45:51.193 --> 00:45:53.688
the way.
If you look at the history of

00:45:53.688 --> 00:45:57.567
engines there are discrete
advances when people were able

00:45:57.567 --> 00:46:00.130
to apply the theory more and
more.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:02.380
Well, in insurance there's a
similar list of inventions.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:12.478
Morris Robinson was head of
Mutual Life of New York in the

00:46:12.478 --> 00:46:22.045
1840s and he got the idea of
highly-paid life insurance

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:27.283
salespeople.
The idea was that it was

00:46:27.283 --> 00:46:31.190
difficult to sell people on
insurance.

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:33.594
Back in the 1840s,
life insurance was very

00:46:33.594 --> 00:46:36.878
important because the average
expectancy of life was only

00:46:36.878 --> 00:46:40.420
something like forty-five years,
so that meant parents were

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.765
dying left and right.
What would be the probability

00:46:43.765 --> 00:46:47.152
that a married couple would
live, both of them,

00:46:47.152 --> 00:46:50.540
to the time when their children
were grown?

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:56.437
Well, it was fairly low, right?
If the average age of death was

00:46:56.437 --> 00:47:00.811
something like forty-five,
maybe a fifty-fifty chance

00:47:00.811 --> 00:47:04.679
of--high risk--of one of the
parents dying.

00:47:04.679 --> 00:47:10.186
You should think that people
would really want life insurance

00:47:10.186 --> 00:47:13.630
but they were not buying it.
Why was it?

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.265
First of all,
they were dying in such

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:17.751
numbers;
p was so high that it

00:47:17.751 --> 00:47:20.770
was expensive.
They have to pay--the premium

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:24.298
has to cover the costs,
so it was tough to get someone

00:47:24.298 --> 00:47:28.159
to buy life insurance even
though they really needed it--it

00:47:28.159 --> 00:47:33.079
was such a good idea for them.
It was partly because there was

00:47:33.079 --> 00:47:35.920
a psychological resistance to
it.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.829
This is still very much alive
today.

00:47:38.829 --> 00:47:42.285
I was standing at the World
Economic Forum at one of our

00:47:42.285 --> 00:47:45.929
lunch things and a young woman
approached from Swiss Re,

00:47:45.929 --> 00:47:50.780
which is the Swiss Reinsurance
Company, and she said she wanted

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:54.769
my ideas on how to sell crop
insurance in Africa.

00:47:54.769 --> 00:47:57.800
She said, we have it now at
Swiss Re and,

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.740
of course, The World Bank
sponsors crop insurance for

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:05.075
farmers.
There are some very poor areas

00:48:05.075 --> 00:48:09.683
in Africa where farmers really
run the risk--if their crop

00:48:09.683 --> 00:48:14.195
fails it could be really bad;
they would be approaching

00:48:14.195 --> 00:48:17.102
starvation.
So, wouldn't you think that

00:48:17.102 --> 00:48:21.142
farmers would want to buy crop
insurance from this Swiss

00:48:21.142 --> 00:48:23.867
company?
Looks like a good idea to me,

00:48:23.867 --> 00:48:26.644
but she says,
we're having a lot of trouble

00:48:26.644 --> 00:48:30.238
selling it.
She said, if you talk to the

00:48:30.238 --> 00:48:35.861
farmers in these rural areas
what do you think they say when

00:48:35.861 --> 00:48:38.435
you offer?
They say, I can't afford the

00:48:38.435 --> 00:48:40.527
insurance.
Well, they're not thinking

00:48:40.527 --> 00:48:43.014
right.
The whole idea of insurance is

00:48:43.014 --> 00:48:47.075
that you take from your good
years and you move it into your

00:48:47.075 --> 00:48:50.929
bad years so that you make it
through all your years.

00:48:50.929 --> 00:48:54.271
So, you're having a good year
this year maybe--it looks that

00:48:54.271 --> 00:48:56.820
way now--and you think you can't
afford it,

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.219
but just think how bad it will
be if it's a bad year.

00:48:59.219 --> 00:49:02.750
Then you really won't be able
to afford to stay alive.

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:07.487
But she says, they didn't;
some of them respond but a

00:49:07.487 --> 00:49:10.931
great majority of them don't.
I think it's because of a

00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:14.517
psychological aversion that
people have to thinking about

00:49:14.517 --> 00:49:16.510
insurance;
it's just unpleasant.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:19.965
Life insurance is actually an
insurance against one of you

00:49:19.965 --> 00:49:22.159
dying;
it's a very unpleasant topic.

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:26.437
If someone comes to your home
and says, I would like to sell

00:49:26.437 --> 00:49:29.495
you life insurance.
You think, some other day,

00:49:29.495 --> 00:49:32.921
I don't want to talk to day
about the probability of one of

00:49:32.921 --> 00:49:37.070
us dying.
So, it was a tough sell.

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.909
Morris Robinson,
however, realized that some

00:49:39.909 --> 00:49:43.606
people are very talented
salespeople and they're probably

00:49:43.606 --> 00:49:46.050
talented at other things as
well.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:51.836
It may sound like a small
improvement but he just had very

00:49:51.836 --> 00:49:57.826
highly-paid insurance salesmen
and they were paid as long as

00:49:57.826 --> 00:50:02.420
people kept their policy.
That motivated insurance

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:06.338
salesmen to form long-term
relationships with the families

00:50:06.338 --> 00:50:10.257
that he was insuring and to keep
them from canceling their

00:50:10.257 --> 00:50:12.267
policies.
He got talented,

00:50:12.267 --> 00:50:15.869
respected members of the
community who people admired to

00:50:15.869 --> 00:50:19.930
become life insurance salesmen
and he had to pay them enough so

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.550
that they would stick with the
job;

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:26.921
then it finally worked.
It may seem crazy but--it may

00:50:26.921 --> 00:50:31.277
seem like a modest innovation
but it actually was--it was an

00:50:31.277 --> 00:50:34.701
important innovation.
I don't know how you think of

00:50:34.701 --> 00:50:37.891
life insurance salespeople,
but they have been pillars of

00:50:37.891 --> 00:50:40.454
the community.
They are people that you--the

00:50:40.454 --> 00:50:43.094
community--trusts,
that people are willing to let

00:50:43.094 --> 00:50:45.789
into their home and discuss
things like death;

00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:51.139
that was an innovation that
came in then.

00:50:51.139 --> 00:51:01.773
The other innovation was by
Henry Hyde and he was at another

00:51:01.773 --> 00:51:07.721
insurance company,
Equitable Life,

00:51:07.721 --> 00:51:14.030
and that was in the late 1800s.

00:51:18.219 --> 00:51:22.250
What he invented was an
insurance policy that had a cash

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:26.573
value and that's another--it's a
cash value on the insurance

00:51:26.573 --> 00:51:30.542
policy.
That is, the insurance policy

00:51:30.542 --> 00:51:37.412
doesn't just insure you against
death, it also builds value over

00:51:37.412 --> 00:51:40.719
the years.
This invention was very

00:51:40.719 --> 00:51:44.989
important because it stopped
people from canceling.

00:51:44.989 --> 00:51:48.945
The big problem life insurance
had was people would buy it and

00:51:48.945 --> 00:51:53.030
they'd pay for several years and
eventually they would think,

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:55.484
well we didn't die,
we're losing all this money,

00:51:55.484 --> 00:51:57.260
let's just cancel the
insurance.

00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.809
It especially happens--the way
life is in real families is:

00:52:00.809 --> 00:52:04.360
you start getting accustomed to
a certain style of life;

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:06.309
you start spending more and
more money;

00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:09.569
there comes a time when you
have a little crunch and you're

00:52:09.569 --> 00:52:12.529
a little short on money;
you're casting your net out for

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:14.320
some way to come up with some
money;

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:17.909
and canceling your life
insurance was a good idea.

00:52:17.909 --> 00:52:23.525
It turns out that if you make
them forfeit their cash value on

00:52:23.525 --> 00:52:26.840
canceling, then they won't
cancel.

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:31.566
Both of these were ideas that
were copied all over the

00:52:31.566 --> 00:52:36.739
world--that's the way inventions
are--so a lot of insurance

00:52:36.739 --> 00:52:44.071
policies today have cash values.
The third thing I was going to

00:52:44.071 --> 00:52:51.626
report was that sociologist
Viviana Zelizer wrote a book

00:52:51.626 --> 00:52:59.320
about life insurance sales in
the nineteenth century.

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:03.559
She found that there was a lot
of resistance to the purchase of

00:53:03.559 --> 00:53:06.500
life insurance in the nineteenth
century.

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:09.885
She tried to study it and tried
to figure out how it was that

00:53:09.885 --> 00:53:12.932
life insurance became more and
more important over that

00:53:12.932 --> 00:53:15.850
century.
One of her conclusions was that

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:19.896
life insurance seemed to be
opposed quite a bit by women,

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:21.920
nineteenth century women.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.531
Why didn't they like it?
You would think that any

00:53:34.531 --> 00:53:37.909
rational woman in the nineteenth
century would reflect on the

00:53:37.909 --> 00:53:41.230
fact that there's a significant
probability that her husband

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:44.440
will die of something while you
still have children.

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:49.161
Why wouldn't they want it?
Well, what she found was that

00:53:49.161 --> 00:53:52.522
life insurance salespeople were
going to families and trying to

00:53:52.522 --> 00:53:55.828
sell them on life insurance by
explaining the concept and they

00:53:55.828 --> 00:53:59.580
would say something like I did.
Maybe they didn't write down

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:03.181
the binomial distribution,
but they explained the idea of

00:54:03.181 --> 00:54:07.039
insurance and it didn't sound
right to the typical nineteenth

00:54:07.039 --> 00:54:10.130
century American woman.
I suppose it wasn't just

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:12.119
America, it was a worldwide
problem.

00:54:12.119 --> 00:54:16.285
The reaction that salespeople
would get from women was,

00:54:16.285 --> 00:54:20.219
you're giving me some
probabilities or something,

00:54:20.219 --> 00:54:24.376
you're asking me to--it sounds
like you're asking me to play in

00:54:24.376 --> 00:54:27.930
some gambling thing where I win
if my husband dies;

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:32.610
it doesn't sound right to me.
I think, in fact,

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:35.135
a lot of women would say
something like,

00:54:35.135 --> 00:54:38.824
I put my faith in God and I
think I might bring down God's

00:54:38.824 --> 00:54:42.773
wrath if I did such a thing as
to bet that my husband is going

00:54:42.773 --> 00:54:46.731
to die.
So, she would refuse to take

00:54:46.731 --> 00:54:49.395
part in it;
it doesn't sound right to

00:54:49.395 --> 00:54:51.780
her--I'll trust in prayer and
other things.

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:56.019
It didn't work and you couldn't
sell them on it.

00:54:56.019 --> 00:54:59.780
What Zelizer reported was that
some life insurance companies

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.840
surmounted this problem by
changing the pitch,

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.945
by telling their salespeople,
don't try to explain

00:55:05.945 --> 00:55:08.289
probability theory to these
people.

00:55:08.289 --> 00:55:12.340
What you have to do is come
across differently.

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:16.851
The thing that she said they
started doing was to pretend,

00:55:16.851 --> 00:55:21.124
in a way, that they were
missionaries with a gospel and

00:55:21.124 --> 00:55:25.905
the gospel was insurance.
They would tell these women,

00:55:25.905 --> 00:55:30.610
you know, if you buy life
insurance on your husband,

00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:34.740
then should anything happen
your husband can love and

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.599
protect you from beyond the
grave.

00:55:37.599 --> 00:55:43.486
That sounds good--it worked and
these little things--they may

00:55:43.486 --> 00:55:49.570
seem like little things but they
are technological advances.

00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:56.959
People in a profession over the
years learn more and more about

00:55:56.959 --> 00:56:03.395
how to manage the public's
expectations and get them to

00:56:03.395 --> 00:56:09.679
actually purchase insurance.
I want to talk about government

00:56:09.679 --> 00:56:14.378
regulation of insurance because
I said that was an important

00:56:14.378 --> 00:56:19.473
aspect of insurance.
The regulators do many things,

00:56:19.473 --> 00:56:23.497
but insurance regulators,
most of all,

00:56:23.497 --> 00:56:27.740
are concerned with capital
adequacy.

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.996
Insurance now,
in the United States,

00:56:36.996 --> 00:56:41.167
is regulated not by the federal
government but by insurance

00:56:41.167 --> 00:56:44.260
regulators in each of the fifty
states.

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:47.384
It's very hard to summarize
insurance regulation in the

00:56:47.384 --> 00:56:49.804
United States.
Why is it regulated separately

00:56:49.804 --> 00:56:53.043
by the fifty states?
That's because it started out

00:56:53.043 --> 00:56:55.379
that way;
when the federal government

00:56:55.379 --> 00:56:58.889
wasn't involved in those sorts
of things and somehow we never

00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:00.912
had the--in fact,
it's talked about--we

00:57:00.912 --> 00:57:03.349
should--maybe we'll see it in
the next ten or twenty years.

00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:06.961
It's talked about that there
should be a federal government

00:57:06.961 --> 00:57:10.760
regulation of insurance but it's
actually state regulators.

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.360
It makes it--this is a handicap
to the U.S.

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.534
insurance industry.
Other countries have it

00:57:15.534 --> 00:57:18.460
centralized but in the U.S.
it's split up over fifty states.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:21.170
It's very hard to start an
insurance company because you've

00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:23.739
got to meet the requirements of
all fifty regulators.

00:57:23.739 --> 00:57:27.921
The most important thing that
these do is: they specify what

00:57:27.921 --> 00:57:31.039
reserves insurance companies
have to hold.

00:57:31.039 --> 00:57:34.954
So they--in other words,
the insurance company--doesn't

00:57:34.954 --> 00:57:39.158
trust the insurance companies to
do the calculations like I

00:57:39.158 --> 00:57:41.840
showed with the binomial
theorem.

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:45.734
They want to make sure that
there's a significantly high

00:57:45.734 --> 00:57:49.982
probability--sufficiently high
probability--that even if they

00:57:49.982 --> 00:57:54.371
get a bad draw and there are a
lot policies that require paying

00:57:54.371 --> 00:57:56.883
out,
that these reserves will

00:57:56.883 --> 00:58:00.737
satisfy.
An insurance company must hold

00:58:00.737 --> 00:58:04.891
the reserves;
it can hold more and that's

00:58:04.891 --> 00:58:09.975
called the statutory surplus.
The reserves are an accounting

00:58:09.975 --> 00:58:13.360
entry--it's how much they are
required to hold,

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.490
but the companies will hold
more than that,

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:20.516
typically, in order to protect
themselves--more than is

00:58:20.516 --> 00:58:24.690
required--and their policy
holders--more than is required

00:58:24.690 --> 00:58:28.547
by the regulators.
Occasionally,

00:58:28.547 --> 00:58:34.430
you get into problems with
reserves.

00:58:38.719 --> 00:58:44.653
Before I get to that let me
just say--I want to just mention

00:58:44.653 --> 00:58:49.280
a few types of insurance that
are important.

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:53.664
Let's talk about life
insurance--and we're talking

00:58:53.664 --> 00:58:57.960
about kinds of policies that are
around today.

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:02.460
The simplest form of life
insurance is called "term

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:06.335
insurance."
This is insurance that you pay

00:59:06.335 --> 00:59:11.657
each year for insurance in that
year and it does not build a

00:59:11.657 --> 00:59:15.768
cash value.
I can buy insurance for myself

00:59:15.768 --> 00:59:21.466
this year and I can stop and if
I--there's nothing gained--or

00:59:21.466 --> 00:59:25.929
next year I would just have to
pay it again.

00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:32.319
"Whole life" is more
complicated because it builds a

00:59:32.319 --> 00:59:38.708
cash value according to a
schedule and there is both

00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:43.719
non-participating and
participating.

00:59:43.719 --> 00:59:46.666
With non-participating--with
participating,

00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:50.454
you are participating in the
portfolio outcome that the

00:59:50.454 --> 00:59:53.119
insurance company is
experiencing,

00:59:53.119 --> 00:59:55.989
so you have some uncertainty
about your cash value.

00:59:55.989 --> 01:00:02.211
There's something called
"variable life," which refers to

01:00:02.211 --> 01:00:08.210
a life insurance policy where
the policyholder can make

01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:14.875
decisions about the investment
of the money in the whole life

01:00:14.875 --> 01:00:17.976
policy.
It's not just taking what's

01:00:17.976 --> 01:00:21.710
given by the insurance company.
There's something called

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:25.546
"universal life"--these are all
explained in Fabozzi,

01:00:25.546 --> 01:00:29.063
et al.
It's a whole life policy that

01:00:29.063 --> 01:00:34.179
gives the policyholder
flexibility over the insurance

01:00:34.179 --> 01:00:37.724
premiums.
You can pay more into the cash

01:00:37.724 --> 01:00:41.035
value in one year and less in
another year,

01:00:41.035 --> 01:00:44.739
as long as you keep paying a
minimum amount.

01:00:44.739 --> 01:00:52.112
There are also survivorship
policies that will pay,

01:00:52.112 --> 01:00:58.304
for example,
the second to die--there would

01:00:58.304 --> 01:01:04.940
be a policy if a husband and
wife get it,

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:08.409
then it pays out when the
second of them dies.

01:01:08.409 --> 01:01:12.751
Also, about regulation,
I want to mention the

01:01:12.751 --> 01:01:18.178
NAIC--it's a very important
institution--that stands for

01:01:18.178 --> 01:01:23.309
National Association of
Insurance Commissioners.

01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:27.051
This is something that's very
important in the United States

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:30.935
because, as I mentioned,
insurance regulation is divided

01:01:30.935 --> 01:01:35.045
up over the fifty states and the
problem that that creates

01:01:35.045 --> 01:01:38.723
is--it's a nightmare for
insurance companies because

01:01:38.723 --> 01:01:42.039
every different state has
different laws.

01:01:42.039 --> 01:01:46.537
Recognizing this problem,
the insurance commissioners in

01:01:46.537 --> 01:01:51.280
the various states have decided
to form an organization,

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.036
that's the NAIC,
and they hold regular

01:01:54.036 --> 01:01:57.066
conferences.
At these conferences,

01:01:57.066 --> 01:02:02.646
they decide on a recommended or
uniform insurance regulation

01:02:02.646 --> 01:02:07.469
policy and it acts a little bit
like a Congress.

01:02:07.469 --> 01:02:11.271
They make laws but the laws are
not binding on anyone,

01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:14.500
they're just suggested laws or
regulations.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:19.338
It's an effort to try to get
the complexity of fifty

01:02:19.338 --> 01:02:24.500
different regulators uniform.
As I say, when the NAIC decides

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.937
on some regulation,
it's only a recommendation to

01:02:27.937 --> 01:02:31.159
the separate state regulatory
commissions.

01:02:31.159 --> 01:02:34.257
But of course,
it has a lot of force because

01:02:34.257 --> 01:02:38.507
all fifty states have met--the
commissioners of fifty states

01:02:38.507 --> 01:02:42.225
have met and hashed it out.
So, most states would

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:46.398
essentially adopt what the NAIC
says, otherwise--they're not

01:02:46.398 --> 01:02:50.641
going to figure it all--they
can't claim to beat--it would be

01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:53.651
rational to do that.
You wouldn't think that we

01:02:53.651 --> 01:02:56.325
would rethink all of these
things ourselves and then have

01:02:56.325 --> 01:02:59.117
it different in our state.
The NAIC is kind of a

01:02:59.117 --> 01:03:02.668
quasi-regulatory body--or a
quasi-government--it's not

01:03:02.668 --> 01:03:06.689
government because it has no
authority and yet it acts almost

01:03:06.689 --> 01:03:10.642
like a parliament where these
people get together and decide

01:03:10.642 --> 01:03:14.060
on things and they end up as a
force of law.

01:03:22.809 --> 01:03:27.606
Another important–-there
are some milestones in insurance

01:03:27.606 --> 01:03:31.351
that I want to mention.
Then I'm going to come back to

01:03:31.351 --> 01:03:34.130
finally concluding with problems
that we see.

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:37.409
Of course, the problems are not
damning;

01:03:37.409 --> 01:03:43.187
they're problems that reflect
the progress yet needed to be

01:03:43.187 --> 01:03:53.344
made in insurance.
I just want to mention the

01:03:53.344 --> 01:04:10.929
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial
Modernization Act of 1999.

01:04:10.929 --> 01:04:16.994
What this did is it allowed
banks to offer insurance or to

01:04:16.994 --> 01:04:22.739
ally and join in and merge with
insurance companies.

01:04:22.739 --> 01:04:24.661
Before that,
as I said before,

01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:28.039
insurance is really the same
thing as securities.

01:04:28.039 --> 01:04:31.730
They're both based on risk
management and pooling of risks.

01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:35.247
Diversification and pooling are
really the same thing but we had

01:04:35.247 --> 01:04:38.469
a separate set of institutions.
People never thought of

01:04:38.469 --> 01:04:42.070
insurance as the same as a bank,
but since this is relatively

01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:45.429
recently--that was only nine
years ago--at this time,

01:04:45.429 --> 01:04:52.047
it means that we are now seeing
an expansion of our banking

01:04:52.047 --> 01:04:58.760
system in the U.S.
to become insurance-related.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.349
It's different in other
countries;

01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:03.889
in Europe, they've had
universal banking,

01:05:03.889 --> 01:05:09.198
which allowed banks to offer
insurance for a much longer time

01:05:09.198 --> 01:05:13.005
but in the U.S.
it's kind of a recent

01:05:13.005 --> 01:05:15.856
innovation.
I want to conclude with

01:05:15.856 --> 01:05:20.269
problems, which may sound kind
of negative but this is--I don't

01:05:20.269 --> 01:05:23.590
shrink from negativism.
It's not really negativism;

01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:25.670
it's talking about what should
be done.

01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:31.410
I want to come back to--I told
you that monoline was in the

01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:36.539
news a lot lately.
So, what are we talking about?

01:05:36.539 --> 01:05:44.446
I don't know how much you read
about the--right now we are

01:05:44.446 --> 01:05:52.630
going through a major financial
crisis, which started in the

01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:56.139
U.S.
but has spread over the world

01:05:56.139 --> 01:05:59.450
and this is called the subprime
crisis.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:10.314
Subprime refers to mortgages,
which is not the subject of

01:06:10.314 --> 01:06:13.782
today's lecture,
but a subprime mortgage is a

01:06:13.782 --> 01:06:18.591
mortgage issued to a borrower
who is not considered prime--not

01:06:18.591 --> 01:06:21.610
a good risk.
They are borrowers that are

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:25.224
thought, by the various models,
to be likely to fail to pay on

01:06:25.224 --> 01:06:28.010
their mortgage and to have to be
foreclosed;

01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:31.303
often low income,
but also they're people with

01:06:31.303 --> 01:06:35.009
poor credit histories.
The crisis that we're in

01:06:35.009 --> 01:06:39.884
now--and this is very important,
you're living through it and

01:06:39.884 --> 01:06:44.261
we'll see how it pans out.
The subprime crisis is

01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:49.316
happening today because home
prices are falling and with

01:06:49.316 --> 01:06:54.278
falling home prices more
subprime borrowers are failing

01:06:54.278 --> 01:06:59.398
to pay their mortgage.
Default rates are shooting up

01:06:59.398 --> 01:07:04.768
and valuation of securitized
subprime mortgages have crashed

01:07:04.768 --> 01:07:10.409
and it's throwing turmoil all
over the financial community.

01:07:10.409 --> 01:07:17.143
We're seeing what they call
systemic effects--that's a very

01:07:17.143 --> 01:07:22.019
general term that goes beyond
insurance.

01:07:22.019 --> 01:07:25.098
By systemic effects,
I mean something that affects

01:07:25.098 --> 01:07:28.815
the whole financial system.
When you do these calculations,

01:07:28.815 --> 01:07:31.871
which I just did for
insurance--I was talking about

01:07:31.871 --> 01:07:35.539
insurance companies--assuming
that risks are independent,

01:07:35.539 --> 01:07:39.730
everything's independent and
we've got it all figured out.

01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:42.453
Underlying it there were other
things besides just the

01:07:42.453 --> 01:07:45.075
calculation of their accident
rates that had certain

01:07:45.075 --> 01:07:48.470
assumptions built in.
The failure of the assumptions

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:52.550
in many different industries can
create systemic effects.

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:55.032
So what happened?
I'm going to talk about a

01:07:55.032 --> 01:07:58.694
particular line of monoline
insurers that you may never have

01:07:58.694 --> 01:08:02.730
even heard of because they don't
deal with the general public.

01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:12.139
These are municipal bond
insurers.

01:08:12.139 --> 01:08:14.512
These are private
companies--insurance

01:08:14.512 --> 01:08:17.974
companies--they're monoline
because they look only at a

01:08:17.974 --> 01:08:21.949
certain class of risks and not
all risks that they insure.

01:08:21.949 --> 01:08:24.358
They deal with,
principally,

01:08:24.358 --> 01:08:29.979
state and local governments who
are issuing bonds to raise money

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:33.562
for their activities,
like New Haven,

01:08:33.562 --> 01:08:37.077
for example,
or any other state or local

01:08:37.077 --> 01:08:40.042
government.
We refer to the bonds that they

01:08:40.042 --> 01:08:43.925
issue as municipal bonds.
Now, the problem is that if you

01:08:43.925 --> 01:08:47.964
invest in bonds from some state
or local government,

01:08:47.964 --> 01:08:52.890
they might not pay you back;
they can just go bankrupt.

01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:56.776
Cities go bankrupt and they
just can't pay,

01:08:56.776 --> 01:09:01.959
so you as a buyer of these
bonds feel reluctant to invest

01:09:01.959 --> 01:09:05.620
in them.
In order to make their bonds

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:10.811
saleable to the general public,
city and state governments

01:09:10.811 --> 01:09:16.003
go--or any region or local
governments go to the municipal

01:09:16.003 --> 01:09:21.377
bond insurer companies and they
have names--the big ones are

01:09:21.377 --> 01:09:26.107
MBIA,
AMBAC, FGIC--that's not FDIC,

01:09:26.107 --> 01:09:32.630
it's not the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation,

01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:35.810
it's FGIC--and there are others
as well.

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:40.255
What these do is they insure
the bond--they insure the

01:09:40.255 --> 01:09:44.449
investor against the
municipality failing to pay on

01:09:44.449 --> 01:09:48.630
the bond.
Lot's of investors won't buy a

01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:52.340
municipal bond unless it's
insured.

01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:56.710
I'm talking about systemic
effects.

01:09:56.710 --> 01:10:00.483
So, these insurance companies
have reserves on hand and they

01:10:00.483 --> 01:10:02.850
invest these reserves in
something.

01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:06.886
What do they invest them in?
Well, one of the things they've

01:10:06.886 --> 01:10:10.079
been investing them in are
subprime mortgages.

01:10:10.079 --> 01:10:12.710
Now, you can see why I'm
talking about systemic effects.

01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:14.992
The housing sector in the
United States,

01:10:14.992 --> 01:10:17.451
you might say,
is completely different from

01:10:17.451 --> 01:10:20.488
municipal bond insurers;
but when the housing sector

01:10:20.488 --> 01:10:22.766
starts going down,
people start defaulting on

01:10:22.766 --> 01:10:26.973
their mortgages.
Then, the value of the subprime

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:33.420
loans that the municipal bond
insurers own starts to go down.

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:37.586
Now, these guys have never
failed to live up to their

01:10:37.586 --> 01:10:42.314
guarantees--they're doing just
fine--but people are noticing

01:10:42.314 --> 01:10:45.600
that their portfolios are going
down,

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.411
so their surplus--statutory
surplus--is going down,

01:10:50.411 --> 01:10:55.319
so we're starting to worry
about these companies.

01:10:55.319 --> 01:11:03.504
Notably, it was January 18,
a rating agency,

01:11:03.504 --> 01:11:14.162
Fitch, lowered AMBAC from
AAA-rated to AA-rated--that was

01:11:14.162 --> 01:11:19.440
a big news story.
You might not have caught it,

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.393
right?
It was a big news story for the

01:11:21.393 --> 01:11:23.779
people who work in the municipal
government.

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:25.710
You say, oh oh,
this is bad news,

01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:29.270
if this is the only--if only
one rating agency does that,

01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:33.361
okay, but--and it's only AMBAC
that's been down-rated,

01:11:33.361 --> 01:11:37.007
but you starting wondering.
So, reporters start calling the

01:11:37.007 --> 01:11:39.686
other rating agencies--Standard
&amp; Poor's and Moody's and

01:11:39.686 --> 01:11:41.593
others--and say,
are you going to down-rate

01:11:41.593 --> 01:11:44.383
these guys?
You read in the newspaper their

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:48.443
interpretation of what's going
to be said and so far the other

01:11:48.443 --> 01:11:52.020
rating agencies haven't;
they're not saying anything.

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:55.347
Now people are suspecting that
these are going to get

01:11:55.347 --> 01:11:57.446
down-rated.
Well, if they're down-rated,

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:59.979
then nobody trusts them anymore
as insurance companies.

01:11:59.979 --> 01:12:05.018
That means that the municipal
governments will find it hard to

01:12:05.018 --> 01:12:08.569
issue bonds to continue their
activities,

01:12:08.569 --> 01:12:12.429
so the municipal governments
might have to shut down some

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:14.909
activities, like fixing the
roads,

01:12:14.909 --> 01:12:19.104
or bridges, or building
schools--whatever the cities do

01:12:19.104 --> 01:12:23.376
with their municipal bond money
that they raise from the

01:12:23.376 --> 01:12:26.268
municipal bonds.
You can see how things are

01:12:26.268 --> 01:12:29.149
feeding through the system:
it starts out in one thing,

01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:32.080
it goes to the insurance
companies, and then it goes to

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:35.515
the municipal governments.
All that kind of thing might

01:12:35.515 --> 01:12:37.909
put this economy into a
recession.

01:12:37.909 --> 01:12:41.738
It's not just municipal
governments, but a lot of

01:12:41.738 --> 01:12:46.205
different aspects of our
financial system are going to be

01:12:46.205 --> 01:12:50.593
touched by a crisis that's
spreading from one segment to

01:12:50.593 --> 01:12:56.029
another.
That's where this stands right

01:12:56.029 --> 01:12:58.852
now.
The latest thing–well,

01:12:58.852 --> 01:13:02.833
now this is a crisis--a
municipal bond crisis which is

01:13:02.833 --> 01:13:05.952
unfolding.
The New York state regulators

01:13:05.952 --> 01:13:09.646
have been trying to get
companies to subscribe more

01:13:09.646 --> 01:13:13.561
capital to the monoline
insurance companies to bolster

01:13:13.561 --> 01:13:17.920
their capital so that they have
more money to pay out;

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.460
that will prevent any more
lowering of their ratings.

01:13:27.979 --> 01:13:32.558
The other thing that's happened
now is that Warren Buffett said

01:13:32.558 --> 01:13:36.029
he wants to get into the
municipal bond insuring

01:13:36.029 --> 01:13:38.337
business.
Well, he's just a business

01:13:38.337 --> 01:13:41.197
person coming in.
So, there will be new municipal

01:13:41.197 --> 01:13:44.866
bond insurers appearing that
will take up slack and we'll be

01:13:44.866 --> 01:13:48.535
all right but the problem is
that we may have a crisis for a

01:13:48.535 --> 01:13:50.893
while.
The other thing that I want to

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:54.074
talk about--and I guess I'm
running out of time--was about

01:13:54.074 --> 01:13:57.869
management of disaster risks.
We have another insurance

01:13:57.869 --> 01:14:01.325
crisis developing now because
of–well,

01:14:01.325 --> 01:14:05.986
a very important source of
insurance risk that's developing

01:14:05.986 --> 01:14:10.809
has to do with the rising rate
of hurricane damage that we're

01:14:10.809 --> 01:14:15.310
observing in the east coast of
the United States.

01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:20.620
Notably, we saw Hurricane
Katrina that caused huge

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:25.714
property damage in--a couple of
years ago--that,

01:14:25.714 --> 01:14:30.699
kind of, tested insurance
companies again.

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:37.723
The risk is that global warming
will make hurricanes more common

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:43.520
and I guess I'll have to--I'll
just conclude that.

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:47.783
I'll talk a little bit about
that--I've gotten through almost

01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:51.560
all of this--next time.
The only other thing--then next

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.433
period we're going to talk--on
Friday we're meeting again and

01:14:55.433 --> 01:14:59.048
we're meeting again about--this
time it's about efficient

01:14:59.048 --> 01:15:02.792
markets and I want to talk about
the evidence for efficient

01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:06.665
markets and against it and that
will lead you into your third

01:15:06.665 --> 01:15:09.569
problem set about efficient
markets.

01:15:09.569 --> 01:15:11.000
That's not coming for a little
while.

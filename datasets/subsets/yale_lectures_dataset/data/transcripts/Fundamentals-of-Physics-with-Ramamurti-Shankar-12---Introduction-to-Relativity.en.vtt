00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.128
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: So,

00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:09.152
let's begin now.
First of all,

00:02:09.152 --> 00:02:12.622
I'm assuming all of you have
some idea what special

00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:14.962
relativity means.
There are two theories of

00:02:14.962 --> 00:02:17.209
relativity, one is the special
theory and one is the general

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.420
theory.
The general theory is something

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.574
that we won't do in any detail.
Special theory is something we

00:02:22.574 --> 00:02:26.224
will do in reasonable detail.
So, it's good to begin by

00:02:26.224 --> 00:02:31.948
asking some of you what is your
present understanding of what

00:02:31.948 --> 00:02:35.440
the subject is all about.
Yes, sir?

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.780
The Yale cap,
what do you think it's about?

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.944
Student: It's about
relative speed in two reference

00:02:42.944 --> 00:02:44.557
systems.
Professor Ramamurti

00:02:44.557 --> 00:02:46.036
Shankar: Okay,
it's about relative speed in

00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:47.750
two reference systems.
I'll come to you;

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.007
then I'll come to you.
Student: It's based on

00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:55.250
the postulate that the laws of
physics are the same in any two

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.285
references moving in uniform
motion relative to one another

00:02:59.285 --> 00:03:03.319
and the speed of light is
constant in all references.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.618
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay,

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:07.642
I will take the last row there.
Student: [inaudible]

00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:10.536
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay,

00:03:10.536 --> 00:03:14.875
so what I've heard so far is
that the laws of physics are the

00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:19.432
same for two people who are both
in inertial frames of reference

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:22.760
and the velocity of light's a
constant.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.506
Right.
That's certainly the way we

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.570
understand the special
relativity theory.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.146
But it's a very old one.
It's been going on long before

00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:34.612
Einstein came.
There was a theory of

00:03:34.612 --> 00:03:38.653
relativity at the time of Newton
and that's where I want to

00:03:38.653 --> 00:03:41.742
begin.
Relativity is not a new idea at

00:03:41.742 --> 00:03:45.628
all, it's an old one.
And the old idea can be

00:03:45.628 --> 00:03:50.648
illustrated in this way and it
will agree with your own

00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:54.277
experience.
So, the standard technique for

00:03:54.277 --> 00:03:58.389
all of relativity is to get
these high speed trains.

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.020
I'm going to have our own high
speed train;

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.020
this is the top view of the
train.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.005
And like in everything I do,
we'll get away with the lowest

00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:12.004
number of dimensions,
which happens to be this one

00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:15.050
spatial dimension and of course
there is time.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.400
So, the train is moving along
the x axis.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.121
You are in this train.
You board the train and all the

00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:30.000
blinds are closed because you
don't want to look outside.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.360
That's not because you're
traveling through some parts of

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.617
New Jersey;
you don't want to look outside

00:04:36.617 --> 00:04:41.440
for this particular experiment.
You get into the train,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.560
you settle down and you explore
the world around you.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.046
You pour yourself a drink,
you play pool,

00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:54.230
you juggle some ping pong
balls, tennis balls,

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.033
and you have a certain
awareness of what's happening,

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:01.910
namely, your understanding of
the mechanical world,

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.692
and then you go to sleep.
When you are sleeping,

00:05:06.692 --> 00:05:12.914
some unseen hand gives to this
train a large velocity,

00:05:12.914 --> 00:05:16.906
200 miles an hour.
The question is,

00:05:16.906 --> 00:05:21.390
"When you wake up,
can you tell if you're moving

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.800
or not?"
That's the whole question.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.175
Will this speed,
whatever I gave you,

00:05:27.175 --> 00:05:31.069
200 miles per hour--will it do
anything to you in this train

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.867
that will betray that velocity?
So, when you wake up will you

00:05:35.867 --> 00:05:39.066
say I'm moving or not?
Now, you might say,

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:42.939
I'm not moving because I'm on
Amtrak and I know this train is

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:45.950
not going anywhere.
That kind of sociological

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.623
reason, by the way,
there are many of them,

00:05:48.623 --> 00:05:50.823
you cannot invoke.
You can only say,

00:05:50.823 --> 00:05:53.959
"I'm on this train.
Is anything different?"

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:57.160
And the claim is that nothing
will be different.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.139
You just will not know you are
moving.

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:04.849
Now, if the train picks up
speed, or slows down,

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.165
you will know right away.
If it picks up speed or

00:06:09.165 --> 00:06:11.868
accelerates, you find yourself
pushed against the back of the

00:06:11.868 --> 00:06:13.850
seat or if the driver slams on
the brake,

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.569
you will slam into the front of
the seat in front of you.

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:20.812
No one is saying that when the
motion is accelerated,

00:06:20.812 --> 00:06:24.021
you will not know.
Accelerated motion can be

00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:28.100
detected in a closed train
without looking outside.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.184
The question is uniform
velocity, no matter how high,

00:06:32.184 --> 00:06:35.350
can that be perceived?
Can that be detected?

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:40.057
So, at the time of Galileo and
Newton everybody agreed that you

00:06:40.057 --> 00:06:43.810
cannot detect it.
Remember that if you started

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.009
out and Newton's laws worked for
you, you are called an inertial

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:51.578
observer.
One of the laws you want is,

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.509
if you leave something,
it should stay where it is.

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:58.009
When the train is accelerating,
that won't be true.

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.686
You leave things on the floor
when it's accelerating,

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:03.483
things will slide backwards.
So, with no apparent force

00:07:03.483 --> 00:07:05.074
acting on it,
things will begin to

00:07:05.074 --> 00:07:07.810
accelerate;
that's a non-inertial frame.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.908
We are not interested in that.
You started out as an observer

00:07:10.908 --> 00:07:14.115
for whom the laws of Newton
work, the laws of inertia work,

00:07:14.115 --> 00:07:16.769
F = ma, then you go to sleep
and you wake up.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.521
So, when I said everything
looks the same,

00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:23.615
I really meant that the laws of
Newton continue to be the same

00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:26.770
because if the laws of Newton
are the same,

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.691
everything will look the same.
That's what it means to say

00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:32.498
"everything looks the same."
Our expectations of what

00:07:32.498 --> 00:07:35.962
happens when I throw it up or
what happens when two billiard

00:07:35.962 --> 00:07:38.545
balls collide,
everything is connected to the

00:07:38.545 --> 00:07:40.999
laws of Newton.
So, the claim is,

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:45.289
the laws of Newton will be
unchanged when this velocity is

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:48.706
added on to you.
Now, we should be clear about

00:07:48.706 --> 00:07:51.467
one thing.
If there is a train next to you

00:07:51.467 --> 00:07:54.963
in the beginning -- let me just
put it on this side for

00:07:54.963 --> 00:07:58.783
convenience -- and you got in
and you boarded this train but

00:07:58.783 --> 00:08:02.149
you looked at this train and it
was not moving.

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:04.592
If you lift the blind and look
through, you'll see the other

00:08:04.592 --> 00:08:06.952
train and there's another
passenger in the other train and

00:08:06.952 --> 00:08:10.120
you look at each other,
you're not moving.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.534
When you wake up after this
brief nap, you find when you

00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:19.509
look outside the other train is
moving at 200 miles an hour.

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:23.603
The question is,
"Can you tell if it's you who's

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:27.000
responsible for this relative
motion,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.466
or maybe nothing happened to
you and the other train is

00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:34.854
moving the opposite way?"
And the claim of relativity is

00:08:34.854 --> 00:08:39.092
that you really cannot tell.
You can tell there is motion

00:08:39.092 --> 00:08:42.019
between the two trains that
wasn't there before.

00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:45.612
That's very clear if you look
outside but there is no way to

00:08:45.612 --> 00:08:48.840
tell what actually happened when
you were sleeping.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.533
Whether you were given the
velocity of 200 to the right or

00:08:51.533 --> 00:08:54.226
the other train was given a
velocity of 200 to the left or

00:08:54.226 --> 00:08:57.340
maybe a combination of the two,
you just cannot tell.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.865
That's the word "relative."
So far -- I didn't tell you --

00:09:00.865 --> 00:09:04.159
if you have only one train,
what I told you earlier,

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:07.770
is that uniform velocity does
not leave its imprint on

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.776
anything you can measure.
If you look outside,

00:09:10.776 --> 00:09:13.751
of course you can see the
motion of the other train,

00:09:13.751 --> 00:09:16.259
but you still cannot tell who
is moving.

00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:20.639
You cannot distinguish between
different possibilities.

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:24.409
So, you have every right to
insist that you are not moving

00:09:24.409 --> 00:09:27.649
and the other train is moving
the opposite way.

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:32.105
Once again, you can make this
argument only for uniform

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:35.789
relative motion.
If your train is accelerating,

00:09:35.789 --> 00:09:39.236
now I'm saying it as if it is
an absolute thing,

00:09:39.236 --> 00:09:41.007
and it is.
You cannot say,

00:09:41.007 --> 00:09:43.897
"I'm not accelerating,
the other train is accelerating

00:09:43.897 --> 00:09:47.030
in the other direction."
You cannot say that because

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.722
you're the one who is barfing up
and throwing up and slamming

00:09:50.722 --> 00:09:53.333
your head on the wall;
nothing is happening to the

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:55.646
other person.
You cannot say "I'm still in

00:09:55.646 --> 00:09:58.218
the same frame,
you are going the opposite

00:09:58.218 --> 00:09:59.755
way."
If you are going the opposite

00:09:59.755 --> 00:10:02.851
way, why am I throwing up?
Or if you are in a rocket and

00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:07.409
the rocket's taking off and the
G forces are enormous,

00:10:07.409 --> 00:10:09.984
many times your weight,
it is the astronauts who are

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:13.269
going through the discomfort.
At that time they cannot say we

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:16.430
are at rest and everyone is
going the opposite way because

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.759
no one else is in danger,
but they are.

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:21.090
So, accelerated motion will
produce effects.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.259
You cannot talk your way out of
that.

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:26.712
But uniform velocity will
produce no effects on you and no

00:10:26.712 --> 00:10:30.345
effects on the other person.
You can detect relative motion

00:10:30.345 --> 00:10:33.915
but you cannot in any sense
maintain that you are moving and

00:10:33.915 --> 00:10:36.820
he's not or that he's moving and
you are not.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.527
You can say,
"I am at rest,

00:10:38.527 --> 00:10:42.007
things are the same as before,
the train is moving the

00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:45.419
opposite way."
Now, if you go in the Amtrak

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:49.720
and you look outside and you
don't see another train,

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.101
but you see the landscape,
you see trees and cows and

00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:54.528
everything, going at 200 miles
an hour in the opposite

00:10:54.528 --> 00:10:57.329
direction,
you have some reason to believe

00:10:57.329 --> 00:11:01.440
that probably the ground is not
moving and you are moving.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.015
But that's just based on what I
called earlier some sociological

00:11:07.015 --> 00:11:08.875
factors.
In other words,

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:12.519
it's completely possible to
devise an experiment in which

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:16.097
somebody puts the whole
landscape on wheels and when you

00:11:16.097 --> 00:11:19.945
go to sleep the landscapes,
cows and trees are made to move

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:22.043
the opposite way.
Not very likely,

00:11:22.043 --> 00:11:25.800
but that's because we know in
practice no one is going to

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.350
bother to do that just to fool
you.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.090
But if that did happen,
you won't know the difference.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.884
So, the reason we rule that out
is we know some extraneous

00:11:33.884 --> 00:11:36.139
things not connected to the laws
of physics.

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:39.116
That's why we don't like to
open the window and look at the

00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:41.169
landscape because then we have a
bias.

00:11:41.169 --> 00:11:44.066
Open the window and look at
another train and you just won't

00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:46.416
know.
That is the principle of

00:11:46.416 --> 00:11:50.848
relativity, that uniform motion
between two observers,

00:11:50.848 --> 00:11:54.360
both of whom are inertial,
is relative.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.789
Each one can insist that he or
she is not moving;

00:11:56.789 --> 00:11:59.299
the other person is the one who
is moving.

00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:02.233
Of course, now,
if the two, in reality,

00:12:02.233 --> 00:12:06.634
if the two trains were at
rest--Let's imagine my train got

00:12:06.634 --> 00:12:09.536
accelerated.
So, during the time it was

00:12:09.536 --> 00:12:12.997
accelerated, I would know,
but if I was sleeping at the

00:12:12.997 --> 00:12:15.132
time,
I don't know and when I wake up

00:12:15.132 --> 00:12:18.220
and the acceleration is gone and
the velocity is constant,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.490
that's when I say,
"I just cannot tell."

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:25.687
All right.
Now, let's show once and for

00:12:25.687 --> 00:12:31.129
all that the laws of Newton are
not going to be modified.

00:12:31.129 --> 00:12:34.229
So, you find the laws of Newton
before you go to sleep,

00:12:34.229 --> 00:12:36.065
you wake up,
you find them again,

00:12:36.065 --> 00:12:38.830
you'll get the same laws;
that's the claim.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.886
I hope you understand that all
the mechanical things you see in

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.450
the world around you come just
from F = ma.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.998
We have seen projectiles and
collision of billiard balls and

00:12:47.998 --> 00:12:50.360
rockets;
they're all Newtonian mechanics.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.856
So, to say that things will
look the same is to say the laws

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:57.471
of Newton that you will deduce
before and after waking up will

00:12:57.471 --> 00:13:00.340
be the same.
So, let's show that.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.504
When you show that,
you're really done with it once

00:13:02.504 --> 00:13:04.960
and for all.
So, let's do the following.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:11.930
Here is the x axis and
here is my frame of reference.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.710
This is my x axis.
Let's call this the origin.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.149
The frame goes to negative and
positive x values.

00:13:18.149 --> 00:13:22.790
Pick some object sitting at the
point x.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.149
Now, we are going to first
define the notion of an event.

00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:35.749
An event is something that
happens at a certain place at a

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:40.879
certain time;
that's called an event.

00:13:40.879 --> 00:13:43.242
For example,
if there's a little firecracker

00:13:43.242 --> 00:13:46.373
going off somewhere at some
time, the x is where it

00:13:46.373 --> 00:13:49.120
happened and the t is
when it happened.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.445
So, this is space-time.
Once again, space-time does not

00:13:54.445 --> 00:13:56.360
require Einstein coming in at
all.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.980
We have known for thousands of
years that if you want to set up

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.436
a meeting with somebody,
you've got to say where and

00:14:01.436 --> 00:14:04.399
you've got to say when and
things do happen in space-time.

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:06.484
The fact that you need x
and t,

00:14:06.484 --> 00:14:08.899
or, if you're living in three
spatial dimensions,

00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:11.122
the fact that you need
x, y,

00:14:11.122 --> 00:14:13.019
z and t is not
new.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:17.279
That is not the revolution
Einstein created.

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:19.995
The fact that you need four
coordinates to label an event is

00:14:19.995 --> 00:14:22.957
nothing new.
What he did that is new will be

00:14:22.957 --> 00:14:26.181
clear later.
So, does everyone understand

00:14:26.181 --> 00:14:28.620
what an event means?
Okay?

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.049
An event is something that
happens and to say exactly where

00:14:32.049 --> 00:14:34.977
and when it happened,
in our world of one dimension,

00:14:34.977 --> 00:14:37.590
we give it an x and we
give it a t.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:41.553
Now, that's me,
and I'm going to give my frame

00:14:41.553 --> 00:14:46.370
of reference the name S.
It turns out S is not

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.947
just based on just my name.
This is the canonical name for

00:14:49.947 --> 00:14:52.393
two observers,
one is called S and one

00:14:52.393 --> 00:14:55.054
is called S prime.
So, S prime,

00:14:55.054 --> 00:14:58.811
let's say, is you.
So, your frame of reference is

00:14:58.811 --> 00:15:03.230
going to be taken to be sliding
relative to mine.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:08.889
So, let's draw a y axis
here.

00:15:08.889 --> 00:15:11.805
We don't really deal with the
y coordinate but just to

00:15:11.805 --> 00:15:14.090
give you a feeling,
this is my y axis;

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.299
that's my x axis;
this is my origin.

00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:18.679
y is not going to play a
big role.

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:23.211
Now, you are sliding this way,
to the right,

00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:29.430
and your speed or velocity is
always denoted by u.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.131
Some number of meters per
second, you are zooming to the

00:15:36.131 --> 00:15:42.250
right at some speed u.
So, imagine now you are going

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.669
past me.
At some instant--I'm sitting

00:15:45.669 --> 00:15:49.257
here at the origin of
coordinates, you cross me and

00:15:49.257 --> 00:15:52.629
then a little later you are
somewhere there.

00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:54.450
So, that's your y frame
axis;

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.316
that's your origin.
And the same event you say has

00:15:58.316 --> 00:16:00.420
a coordinate x prime.

00:16:04.049 --> 00:16:07.594
We arrange it so that when you
zoom past me,

00:16:07.594 --> 00:16:12.210
you set your clock to zero and
I set my clock to zero.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.600
When you want to set the clock
to zero is completely arbitrary.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.399
So, we will decide right when
you pass me.

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:19.378
I'm at the origin of my
coordinates, you're at the

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:21.937
origin of your coordinates.
When you pass me,

00:16:21.937 --> 00:16:26.427
we'll click our stop watches
and we will set the time to

00:16:26.427 --> 00:16:28.920
zero.
So, here's an event.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.942
You and I crossed.
What are the coordinates for

00:16:31.942 --> 00:16:34.269
that event?
According to me,

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:40.674
that event occurred at x
= 0 and the time was chosen to

00:16:40.674 --> 00:16:43.076
be zero.
According to you,

00:16:43.076 --> 00:16:47.623
your origin was also on top of
my origin, so x prime was

00:16:47.623 --> 00:16:50.409
zero and the time is just the
time.

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:53.110
Everybody has a single time,
and that time is called zero.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:57.123
That is one event.
We made the coordinate of the

00:16:57.123 --> 00:16:59.730
event zero zero for both you and
me.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.210
It is zero in space because my
origin crossed your origin.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.779
That crossing took place at my
origin;

00:17:05.779 --> 00:17:08.783
that's why my x is zero
and took place at your origin,

00:17:08.783 --> 00:17:11.487
that's where your x
prime is zero and the common

00:17:11.487 --> 00:17:13.640
time we chose to be zero by
convention.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:20.245
Then, we want a second event.
So, let's say the second event

00:17:20.245 --> 00:17:23.359
is some firecracker going off
here.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:27.170
Here is something I should
explain that I used to forget in

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.500
the previous years.
When I say I am moving,

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.163
I imagine I am part of a huge
team of people who are all

00:17:35.163 --> 00:17:38.762
moving with me.
So, I've got agents all over

00:17:38.762 --> 00:17:42.020
the x axis who are my
eyes and ears;

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.987
they are looking out for me.
So, even though I am here,

00:17:44.987 --> 00:17:47.143
if there's a firecracker
exploding here,

00:17:47.143 --> 00:17:51.558
my guys will tell me.
And you are carrying your own

00:17:51.558 --> 00:17:53.830
agents.
Let's say at every point

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.435
x you have a reporter,
x = 1,2,

00:17:56.435 --> 00:17:58.051
3,4;
there are people sitting and

00:17:58.051 --> 00:18:00.724
watching.
So, when I say I see something,

00:18:00.724 --> 00:18:04.634
I really mean me and my
buddies, all traveling the same

00:18:04.634 --> 00:18:08.508
train at the same speed,
all over space taking notes on

00:18:08.508 --> 00:18:11.113
what's happening.
We'll pool our information

00:18:11.113 --> 00:18:13.910
later but we know this explosion
took place here.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:18.816
I'll simplify it by saying I
know an explosion took place

00:18:18.816 --> 00:18:22.760
here at location x at
time t.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:29.700
So, this is our crossing.
This event is when we crossed.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.728
Then, there is a firecracker.
For the firecracker,

00:18:33.728 --> 00:18:36.563
I have to give some events
[should have said

00:18:36.563 --> 00:18:39.326
"coordinates"].
I say it took place at location

00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:40.700
x at time t.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:48.618
What do you say?
You measure the distance from

00:18:48.618 --> 00:18:51.567
your origin, you call this some
x prime,

00:18:51.567 --> 00:18:55.077
the time is still t.
In Newtonian mechanics,

00:18:55.077 --> 00:18:58.388
the time is just the time.
How many seconds have passed is

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:01.013
the same for everybody.
The question is,

00:19:01.013 --> 00:19:06.650
"What is the relation between
x prime and x?"

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.549
That's what we want to think
about.

00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:12.569
So, you guys should think
before I write down the answer.

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:15.509
What's the relation of x
prime to x?

00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:18.673
Well, this event took place at
time t,

00:19:18.673 --> 00:19:22.556
so I know that your origin is
to the right by an amount

00:19:22.556 --> 00:19:24.570
u times t.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.484
So, the distance from your
origin for this event,

00:19:32.484 --> 00:19:35.780
I maintain is x prime is
x - ut.

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:45.110
Again, I want all of you to
follow everything.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:49.473
These are all simple notions.
Our origins coincided at zero

00:19:49.473 --> 00:19:53.619
time for the event that occurs
at time t.

00:19:53.619 --> 00:19:56.200
Therefore, in a sense,
you are rushing toward the

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.736
event.
You've gone a distance

00:19:57.736 --> 00:20:00.044
ut.
Therefore, the distance from

00:20:00.044 --> 00:20:03.865
your origin to the event will be
less than mine by this amount

00:20:03.865 --> 00:20:07.250
ut.
This is the law of

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:14.960
transformation of coordinates in
Newtonian mechanics.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.108
If you have an event--if you
want, formally,

00:20:19.108 --> 00:20:24.125
you can define it time,
t prime for the primed

00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:26.565
observer.
It goes without saying that

00:20:26.565 --> 00:20:28.410
t prime and t are
the same.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.450
There's no notion of time for
me and time for you.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.320
There's universal time in
Newtonian mechanics.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.650
It just runs.
We can call some time a zero.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.234
Once we have agreed,
if you say you and I met at

00:20:40.234 --> 00:20:44.734
t = 0 and an explosion
took place 5 seconds after our

00:20:44.734 --> 00:20:47.004
meeting,
it's going to be 5 seconds

00:20:47.004 --> 00:20:50.131
after our meeting for me and
it's going to be 5 seconds after

00:20:50.131 --> 00:20:53.467
the meeting for you.
The time difference between two

00:20:53.467 --> 00:20:55.880
events is the same for all
people.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.560
This is called the Galilean
transformation.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.750
What are the consequences of
Galilean transformation?

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.133
Well, let's look at the fact
that x prime is x -

00:21:12.133 --> 00:21:12.510
ut.

00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:21.789
Remember, everything is varying
with time.

00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:24.879
So x prime is a function
of time and x is a

00:21:24.879 --> 00:21:27.362
function of time,
if you are watching a moving

00:21:27.362 --> 00:21:31.451
particle.
Suppose this firecracker is not

00:21:31.451 --> 00:21:36.019
just one event,
but it's a moving object.

00:21:36.019 --> 00:21:37.960
Let's give the object some
speed;

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.062
it's moving to the right.
Then the velocity,

00:21:41.062 --> 00:21:48.222
according to me--I'm going to
call v as dx/dt is

00:21:48.222 --> 00:21:53.882
the velocity.
Let's just call it a bullet,

00:21:53.882 --> 00:21:59.502
according to S.
Then w -- it's the

00:21:59.502 --> 00:22:05.331
standard name -- is the velocity
of the bullet according to

00:22:05.331 --> 00:22:08.568
S prime.
So, what I've done is,

00:22:08.568 --> 00:22:12.335
I first took one event and I
gave it some coordinates and I

00:22:12.335 --> 00:22:16.101
told you how to transform the
coordinate from one person to

00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:19.431
the other person.
But now, take that point

00:22:19.431 --> 00:22:23.790
x not to be a fixed
location but a moving object,

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.990
so that as a function of time
that body is moving.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:32.962
Then its velocity at any time
is dx prime dt

00:22:32.962 --> 00:22:36.708
according to you;
that is the dx/dt

00:22:36.708 --> 00:22:40.623
according to me,
minus the derivative of this,

00:22:40.623 --> 00:22:46.230
which is u.
Now, does that make sense?

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.960
This should agree with common
sense.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.292
For example,
if that bullet is going at 600

00:22:52.292 --> 00:22:56.259
miles per hour to the right,
that is 600 for me,

00:22:56.259 --> 00:23:00.512
and you are going to the right
in your train at 200 miles per

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:04.552
hour, you should measure the
bullet speed to be reduced by

00:23:04.552 --> 00:23:09.029
200 and you should get 400.
That's all it means.

00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:11.691
The two people will disagree on
the velocity of the bullet

00:23:11.691 --> 00:23:13.980
because they are moving relative
to each other.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.430
This is the way you will add
velocities.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.769
But let's look at the
acceleration.

00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:26.071
dw/dt is going to be
dv/dt - 0 because

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:28.670
u is a constant.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.980
That means you and I agree on
the acceleration of the body.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.180
We disagree on where it is.
We disagree on how fast the

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.384
bullet's moving.
But we agree on the

00:23:44.384 --> 00:23:47.914
acceleration of the body because
all I've done is add a constant

00:23:47.914 --> 00:23:51.511
velocity to everything you see.
Therefore, if according to you

00:23:51.511 --> 00:23:54.894
the velocity of the body is not
changing, according to me the

00:23:54.894 --> 00:23:57.150
velocity of the body is not
changing,

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.789
because the constant added will
drop out of the difference.

00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:02.972
Or, if the body has an
acceleration,

00:24:02.972 --> 00:24:06.339
we'll both get the same answer
for the acceleration.

00:24:06.339 --> 00:24:08.009
So, that is the common
acceleration a.

00:24:08.009 --> 00:24:10.726
So, if you like,
a-prime is the same as

00:24:10.726 --> 00:24:11.390
a.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.713
So, the acceleration of bodies
doesn't change when you go from

00:24:17.713 --> 00:24:20.205
one frame of reference to
another one going at a constant

00:24:20.205 --> 00:24:20.650
speed.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:28.172
All right, so let's look at
F = ma,

00:24:28.172 --> 00:24:34.608
which is md^(2)x/dt^(2)
is equal to some force on the

00:24:34.608 --> 00:24:38.027
body.
And you look at the body and

00:24:38.027 --> 00:24:43.338
you say d^(2)x prime over
dt^(2) is the force on

00:24:43.338 --> 00:24:46.155
your body.
First, I want to convince you

00:24:46.155 --> 00:24:49.062
we wanted to see that the
left-hand sides are equal

00:24:49.062 --> 00:24:51.329
because the acceleration's the
same.

00:24:51.329 --> 00:24:55.340
Then, I want to convince you
that the right-hand sides are

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:59.282
also going to be equal.
I can take many examples but

00:24:59.282 --> 00:25:02.009
eventually you will get the
point.

00:25:02.009 --> 00:25:06.960
Let us not consider one body,
but let's consider two bodies.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.602
Two bodies are feeling a
certain force due to,

00:25:10.602 --> 00:25:13.398
say, gravitation.
And gravitation is,

00:25:13.398 --> 00:25:17.175
of course, a force in three
dimensions but let's write the

00:25:17.175 --> 00:25:21.312
force in just one dimension.
And let's say the force of

00:25:21.312 --> 00:25:24.837
gravity is equal to 1 over
x_1 -

00:25:24.837 --> 00:25:28.843
x_2.
Force on 1 due to 2 and the

00:25:28.843 --> 00:25:33.833
force on 2 due to 1 will be
minus 1 over x_1 -

00:25:33.833 --> 00:25:37.666
x_2.
The real forces are separation

00:25:37.666 --> 00:25:41.180
in three dimensions but this is
a fictitious force.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.285
I want to call it gravity.
It is any force that depends on

00:25:44.285 --> 00:25:46.509
the coordinates of the two
particles.

00:25:46.509 --> 00:25:49.648
So, I will say
m_1d^(2)x

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:53.485
_1 over
dt^(2) is 1 over

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:57.059
x_1 -
x_2.

00:25:57.059 --> 00:26:00.041
And m_2d^(2)x
_2 over

00:26:00.041 --> 00:26:03.720
dt^(2) is minus 1 over
x_1 minus--I

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.321
have forgotten constants like
g and

00:26:06.321 --> 00:26:09.619
m_1 and
m_2.

00:26:09.619 --> 00:26:11.410
They don't matter for this
purpose.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:14.884
So, here are two bodies.
They feel a force for each

00:26:14.884 --> 00:26:17.420
other and I've discovered what
the force is.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.349
It's 1 over x_1 -
x_2.

00:26:19.349 --> 00:26:21.170
I don't care if it's 1 over
x_1 -

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.747
x_2 or
(x_1 -

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:25.230
x_2)^(2);
that's not important.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.736
What's important is,
it depends on x_1

00:26:27.736 --> 00:26:31.028
- x_2.
You come along and you study

00:26:31.028 --> 00:26:34.539
the same two masses.
What will you say is happening?

00:26:34.539 --> 00:26:37.275
You will say,
m_1d^(2)x

00:26:37.275 --> 00:26:41.887
_1 prime over
dt^(2) is equal to 1 over

00:26:41.887 --> 00:26:46.890
x_1 prime minus
x_2 prime.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.069
Maybe I will--I'm sorry.
Let me do it a little better.

00:26:50.069 --> 00:26:52.829
I can tell you what you will
see.

00:26:52.829 --> 00:26:56.998
Given this is what I see,
I can tell you what you will

00:26:56.998 --> 00:26:59.049
see.
Let's do that in our head.

00:26:59.049 --> 00:27:02.663
We know that the acceleration
is the same for any mass so I'm

00:27:02.663 --> 00:27:06.276
going to write this thing as
m of dx over prime

00:27:06.276 --> 00:27:08.094
dt^(2).
In other words,

00:27:08.094 --> 00:27:10.543
the acceleration according to
me is the same as the

00:27:10.543 --> 00:27:13.756
acceleration according to you.
Then, I'm also going to write

00:27:13.756 --> 00:27:16.728
the right-hand side as
x_1 prime minus

00:27:16.728 --> 00:27:20.230
x_2 prime.
Do you understand that?

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:24.058
If there are two bodies feeling
a force, if you see it from a

00:27:24.058 --> 00:27:26.675
moving train,
the distance between the two

00:27:26.675 --> 00:27:29.099
bodies is the same for you and
me,

00:27:29.099 --> 00:27:31.526
because x_1
prime is x_1 -

00:27:31.526 --> 00:27:34.084
ut and x_2
prime is x_2 -

00:27:34.084 --> 00:27:35.769
ut.
Take the difference;

00:27:35.769 --> 00:27:38.336
the difference between the
location of the particles is the

00:27:38.336 --> 00:27:40.860
same for you and me.
Acceleration is the same,

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.396
mass is postulated to be the
same, so I know that you will

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:49.019
get the same law that I get.
You will get F = ma;

00:27:49.019 --> 00:27:51.349
your acceleration will be the
same as mine;

00:27:51.349 --> 00:27:53.883
the force you attribute between
the two bodies will also be the

00:27:53.883 --> 00:27:56.673
same.
That is why I know that you

00:27:56.673 --> 00:28:01.680
will also deduce the same
Newtonian laws that I will.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.878
You can also say it differently.
If I woke up from my nap and I

00:28:06.878 --> 00:28:11.014
am now in a moving train and I
examine the world around me,

00:28:11.014 --> 00:28:14.079
I'm going to get the same F
= ma.

00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:18.453
Because as seen by a person on
the ground, the masses obey F

00:28:18.453 --> 00:28:21.124
= ma.
I am in this moving train now

00:28:21.124 --> 00:28:25.045
but I have the same acceleration
for each mass and I have the

00:28:25.045 --> 00:28:27.017
same force.
So, if you want,

00:28:27.017 --> 00:28:29.329
I'll complete the second
equation.

00:28:29.329 --> 00:28:32.535
m_2d^(2)
x_2 prime over

00:28:32.535 --> 00:28:36.459
dt^(2) will be minus 1
over x_1 prime

00:28:36.459 --> 00:28:38.880
minus x_2
prime.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.130
If this is a little difficult,
we should talk about this.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:47.327
I'm telling you that if I
deduce F = ma and the

00:28:47.327 --> 00:28:50.891
F depends on the
separation between the

00:28:50.891 --> 00:28:53.907
particles,
then I'm sure that you will

00:28:53.907 --> 00:28:58.077
find the same laws of motion
because the acceleration is the

00:28:58.077 --> 00:29:02.458
same that I get because we have
seen a-prime is the same

00:29:02.458 --> 00:29:05.227
as a.
And the force will also be the

00:29:05.227 --> 00:29:08.100
same because the force depends
on the separation between

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.899
particles.
And that doesn't depend on

00:29:10.899 --> 00:29:15.219
which train you're in or it's
not affected by adding a

00:29:15.219 --> 00:29:19.049
constant velocity to the frame
of reference.

00:29:19.049 --> 00:29:22.303
So, if you like,
this is the way you prove in

00:29:22.303 --> 00:29:26.000
Newtonian mechanics the
principle of relativity.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.587
So, not only is it something
you observe by going on trains

00:29:29.587 --> 00:29:32.308
and what not,
you can actually show that this

00:29:32.308 --> 00:29:35.029
is the reason everything looks
the same.

00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:38.246
In other words,
if the train was at rest on the

00:29:38.246 --> 00:29:42.371
platform and you and I were
comparing notes and we both find

00:29:42.371 --> 00:29:45.080
F = ma,
I go to sleep and I'm waking up

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.140
and the train is going at a
constant speed,

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.911
if you can look through the
window and look at the objects

00:29:49.911 --> 00:29:52.634
in my train, you will say they
obey F = ma because

00:29:52.634 --> 00:29:55.659
nothing has happened to you.
But you will predict I will

00:29:55.659 --> 00:29:58.760
also say F = ma because
if you see an acceleration,

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.720
I will see the same
acceleration.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.796
If you see a distance between
two masses to be one meter,

00:30:03.796 --> 00:30:06.881
I'll also think it's one meter.
If the force is 1 over the

00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:09.228
square of the distance,
we'll agree on the force,

00:30:09.228 --> 00:30:10.744
we'll agree on the
acceleration,

00:30:10.744 --> 00:30:14.045
we'll agree on everything.
And once you've proven F =

00:30:14.045 --> 00:30:16.322
ma is valid,
it follows that every

00:30:16.322 --> 00:30:19.400
mechanical phenomenon will
behave the same way.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.760
That's the reason things behave
the same way.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.693
Yes?
Student: If for some

00:30:25.693 --> 00:30:29.936
weird reason,
suppose different frames of

00:30:29.936 --> 00:30:34.710
reference, the rule F =
ma was to fail,

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.836
what would happen?
Professor Ramamurti

00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:39.740
Shankar: You mean if the
rule failed in the other frame?

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.037
Student: Hypothetically.
Professor Ramamurti

00:30:41.037 --> 00:30:42.276
Shankar: Yes.
Suppose, hypothetically,

00:30:42.276 --> 00:30:44.511
that happened.
Then, it would mean that when

00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:47.345
you wake up in the train,
you will look at the world

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:49.956
around you, it will look
different because F ≠

00:30:49.956 --> 00:30:51.625
ma.
You will conclude,

00:30:51.625 --> 00:30:53.619
when I went to sleep it was
F = ma;

00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:55.396
when I got up,
F ≠ ma,

00:30:55.396 --> 00:30:59.016
the train is moving.
So, you will have to conclude

00:30:59.016 --> 00:31:02.849
that uniform velocity makes
detectable changes.

00:31:02.849 --> 00:31:06.625
And if you look outside the
train, to the other train,

00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:09.190
the other train's going
backwards.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.000
You can now no longer say,
"You're going the other way,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.342
I'm not moving",
because the other person will

00:31:14.342 --> 00:31:16.580
say, "Hey, F = ma works
for me."

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.077
It doesn't work for you.
So, you're the guy who's

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:21.253
moving."
So, you've lost the equal

00:31:21.253 --> 00:31:25.321
status with other inertial
observers because those for whom

00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:29.809
F = ma worked will say
they're not moving and for you,

00:31:29.809 --> 00:31:32.120
it doesn't work,
so you will have to concede you

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.039
are moving.
So, uniform velocity,

00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:36.965
if it makes perceptible
changes, can no longer be

00:31:36.965 --> 00:31:40.318
considered as relative.
It's absolute and if you and I

00:31:40.318 --> 00:31:43.323
find each other moving,
there may be a real sense in

00:31:43.323 --> 00:31:45.740
which I am at rest and you are
moving,

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:48.600
because for me F = ma
works and for you it doesn't.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.476
Well, that's not what happens.
In real life,

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:54.338
you find it works for both of
these and either of us can

00:31:54.338 --> 00:31:58.764
maintain we are not moving.
So now, you've got to fast

00:31:58.764 --> 00:32:02.957
forward to about 300 years.
This goes on,

00:32:02.957 --> 00:32:07.813
no problem with this principle
of relativity and 300 years

00:32:07.813 --> 00:32:10.202
later,
people have discovered

00:32:10.202 --> 00:32:13.816
electricity and magnetism and
electromagnetism and

00:32:13.816 --> 00:32:17.609
electromagnetic waves,
which they identify as light.

00:32:17.609 --> 00:32:22.487
And then, it was discovered
that what you and I call light

00:32:22.487 --> 00:32:27.450
is just electric and magnetic
fields traveling in space.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:29.683
You don't have to know what
electro-magnetic fields are

00:32:29.683 --> 00:32:31.473
right now.
They are some measurable

00:32:31.473 --> 00:32:33.680
phenomenon.
They are like waves.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.696
And the waves have a certain
velocity that Maxwell calculated

00:32:37.696 --> 00:32:41.847
and that velocity is this famous
number 3 times 10 to the eight

00:32:41.847 --> 00:32:45.128
meters per second.
And the question was,

00:32:45.128 --> 00:32:47.970
"For whom is this the
velocity?"

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:50.838
For example,
you can do a calculation of

00:32:50.838 --> 00:32:54.295
waves on a string,
something we'll be able to do

00:32:54.295 --> 00:32:57.333
in our course.
Waves on a string will be some

00:32:57.333 --> 00:33:00.473
answer that depends on the
tension on the string and the

00:33:00.473 --> 00:33:04.014
mass density of the string and
that's the velocity as seen by a

00:33:04.014 --> 00:33:06.470
person for whom the string is at
rest.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:10.276
But if you calculate the waves
of sound in this room -- I talk

00:33:10.276 --> 00:33:13.832
to you, you hear me slightly
later -- the time it takes to

00:33:13.832 --> 00:33:16.890
travel is the velocity of sound
in this room.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:21.438
That is calculated with respect
to the air in this room because

00:33:21.438 --> 00:33:25.398
the waves travel in the air.
In fact, the fact that all of

00:33:25.398 --> 00:33:28.672
us are sitting on the planet,
which itself is moving at

00:33:28.672 --> 00:33:30.732
whatever,
1,100 miles per second,

00:33:30.732 --> 00:33:32.992
doesn't matter,
because the air is being

00:33:32.992 --> 00:33:36.470
carried along so even if the
Earth came to a sudden halt,

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.826
as far as the velocity of sound
in this room is concerned,

00:33:38.826 --> 00:33:40.819
it won't matter,
because we are carrying the

00:33:40.819 --> 00:33:44.179
medium with us.
So, people wanted to know what

00:33:44.179 --> 00:33:48.196
is the medium which carries the
waves of light,

00:33:48.196 --> 00:33:51.520
electromagnetic waves?
First of all,

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.081
the medium is everywhere
because--How do we know it's

00:33:56.081 --> 00:33:58.920
everywhere?
Can anybody tell me?

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.244
Yes?
Student: It travels

00:34:05.244 --> 00:34:06.487
through the vacuum of space.
Professor Ramamurti

00:34:06.487 --> 00:34:07.690
Shankar: Right.
It travels in the vacuum of

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:08.969
space.
We can see the Sun;

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:10.816
we can see the stars,
so we know the medium is

00:34:10.816 --> 00:34:13.032
everywhere.
Then, you can sort of ask,

00:34:13.032 --> 00:34:16.439
"How dense is the medium?"
It turns out that the denser

00:34:16.439 --> 00:34:18.987
the medium, the more rapidly
signals travel,

00:34:18.987 --> 00:34:21.239
in most of the things that we
know.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:24.329
For example,
when we look at waves in sound

00:34:24.329 --> 00:34:27.639
and when we look at sound waves
in a solid,

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:29.832
or in iron, you find in a very
dense material,

00:34:29.832 --> 00:34:32.583
that the velocity is very high.
S,o this medium,

00:34:32.583 --> 00:34:35.872
which is called "ether," would
have to be very,

00:34:35.872 --> 00:34:40.090
very dense to support waves of
this incredible velocity.

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.979
But then, planets have been
moving through this medium for

00:34:43.979 --> 00:34:46.640
years and years and not slowing
down.

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.480
It's a very peculiar medium.
But it has to be everywhere so

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.028
we are all immersed in this
medium because we are able to

00:34:54.028 --> 00:34:57.639
send light signals to different
parts of the universe.

00:34:57.639 --> 00:35:02.017
And the question is,
"How fast is the Earth moving

00:35:02.017 --> 00:35:06.330
relative to this medium?"
You understand?

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:10.651
This medium is all pervasive.
We know that we can see the

00:35:10.651 --> 00:35:13.699
stars so it's going all the way
up to the stars and beyond.

00:35:13.699 --> 00:35:17.239
And we are immersed in this and
we are drifting around in space.

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:19.969
What is our speed relative to
the medium?

00:35:19.969 --> 00:35:21.639
That's the question that was
asked.

00:35:21.639 --> 00:35:25.201
Well, to find the speed
relative to the medium,

00:35:25.201 --> 00:35:30.079
you calculate the velocity in
the medium by Maxwell's theory.

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:33.940
So, here's the medium in which
waves travel at a certain speed.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:37.409
This is planet Earth going
around the Sun.

00:35:37.409 --> 00:35:40.172
At some instant,
you will have a certain

00:35:40.172 --> 00:35:43.608
velocity with respect to ether.
And therefore,

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:48.082
the velocity of light as seen
by you will be modified from

00:35:48.082 --> 00:35:51.592
c to c - V.
In particular,

00:35:51.592 --> 00:35:56.750
suppose the waves are traveling
to the right in ether.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.104
Let me draw it this way.
The Earth is going at this

00:35:59.104 --> 00:36:02.560
instant at the speed V.
We expect the speed to be c

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.671
- V because part of the
speed is neutralized because you

00:36:06.671 --> 00:36:10.580
are going along with the waves.
You'll see a slower velocity.

00:36:13.909 --> 00:36:16.980
So, Mr.
Michelson and his assistant

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:23.965
Morley--they did the experiment.
And they got the answer equal

00:36:23.965 --> 00:36:27.610
to c.
What does that mean?

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:31.782
Student: The speed of
light [inaudible]

00:36:31.782 --> 00:36:35.305
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

00:36:35.305 --> 00:36:39.570
no, but you cannot jump to that
right now.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:44.439
If you are following Newtonian
physics, your expectation is,

00:36:44.439 --> 00:36:47.429
it should be c - V.
Yes?

00:36:47.429 --> 00:36:52.619
Student: It means that
there is no ether.

00:36:52.619 --> 00:36:53.804
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Well,

00:36:53.804 --> 00:36:55.165
that's--not so fast,
but it certainly means the

00:36:55.165 --> 00:36:56.853
following.
Well, there's a simpler answer

00:36:56.853 --> 00:36:58.329
than that.
Yes?

00:36:58.329 --> 00:37:00.818
Student: It means that
the Earth is moving with respect

00:37:00.818 --> 00:37:01.962
to the ether.
Professor Ramamurti

00:37:01.962 --> 00:37:03.860
Shankar: At what speed?
Student: Zero.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:04.789
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Zero.

00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:07.139
Because you don't have
to--Look, you guys are ready to

00:37:07.139 --> 00:37:09.400
overthrow everything because you
know the answer.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:14.418
But you've got to put yourself
in the place of somebody in the

00:37:14.418 --> 00:37:16.920
early 1900s.
There's no reason to overthrow

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.395
anything.
The answer is,

00:37:18.395 --> 00:37:22.435
you're going at the speed zero.
Of course, you realize,

00:37:22.435 --> 00:37:26.858
that it is incredibly fortunate
that on the one day Michelson

00:37:26.858 --> 00:37:31.102
wants to do the experiment,
we happen to be at rest with

00:37:31.102 --> 00:37:34.059
respect to the ether.
Fine.

00:37:34.059 --> 00:37:37.726
But we know that luck is not
going to last forever because

00:37:37.726 --> 00:37:42.860
you are going around the Sun.
On a particular day may be.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:46.156
But that velocity was such that
on that day the Earth was at

00:37:46.156 --> 00:37:49.184
rest with respect to the ether.
It's clear that six months

00:37:49.184 --> 00:37:51.188
later, when we are going the
other direction,

00:37:51.188 --> 00:37:53.739
you cannot also be at rest with
respect to the ether.

00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:57.730
But that's what you find when
you do the experiment.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:01.357
You find every day you get the
same answer and you jolly well

00:38:01.357 --> 00:38:04.194
know you are not at rest.
You are moving around the Sun

00:38:04.194 --> 00:38:05.210
for sure.
Yes?

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:07.281
Student: Did they
postulate a drag for the Earth

00:38:07.281 --> 00:38:08.854
turning [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:38:08.854 --> 00:38:10.966
Shankar: Yes.
So, people tried other

00:38:10.966 --> 00:38:13.284
solutions.
But it is simply a fact that

00:38:13.284 --> 00:38:16.612
when you move one way or six
months later in the opposite

00:38:16.612 --> 00:38:19.050
way, you get the same answer
c.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:23.358
So, one possibility is,
you don't want--Look,

00:38:23.358 --> 00:38:28.449
don't be ready to do
revolutions, try to avoid it.

00:38:28.449 --> 00:38:31.500
So, one answer is,
look at the speed of sound.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:35.375
You and I talked to each other
then and we talked to each other

00:38:35.375 --> 00:38:38.239
six months from now;
we get the same speed of sound.

00:38:38.239 --> 00:38:40.262
The speed of sound is published
in textbooks,

00:38:40.262 --> 00:38:41.703
right?
Seven hundred and something

00:38:41.703 --> 00:38:44.262
miles per hour.
How come that doesn't change

00:38:44.262 --> 00:38:47.624
from day to day?
Anybody here on this side can

00:38:47.624 --> 00:38:52.165
tell me why the speed of sound
doesn't change from day to day

00:38:52.165 --> 00:38:57.210
even though we are moving?
No one here can guess?

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.167
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:39:00.167 --> 00:39:02.159
Shankar: No,
we are moving.

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:04.737
Even six months from now,
we get the same speed of sound

00:39:04.737 --> 00:39:06.631
in this room.
When I talk to you,

00:39:06.631 --> 00:39:09.139
does it matter what time of
year it is?

00:39:09.139 --> 00:39:12.750
Student: The medium is
moving along with us?

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:13.613
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes,

00:39:13.613 --> 00:39:15.309
we are carrying air.
As the Earth moves through

00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:18.194
space, it carries the air with
you and the speed of the wave is

00:39:18.194 --> 00:39:20.750
with respect to the medium.
If you can carry the medium

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:23.200
with you, then it doesn't matter
how fast you're moving.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.847
So, they tried that.
They tried to argue that the

00:39:26.847 --> 00:39:31.000
Earth carries ether with it the
way it carries air with it.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.819
Then, it's not an accident you
are at rest with respect to the

00:39:34.819 --> 00:39:37.449
ether because you're taking it
with you.

00:39:37.449 --> 00:39:40.390
But it's very easy to show by
looking at distant stars that

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.259
you cannot be doing that.
I don't have time to tell you

00:39:43.259 --> 00:39:47.470
why that is true.
So, you cannot take the ether

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:54.483
with you and you cannot leave it
behind, and that's the impasse

00:39:54.483 --> 00:39:58.679
people were in.
So, it's as if there's a car

00:39:58.679 --> 00:40:02.920
that's going to the right at a
certain speed c.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.530
You move to the right at some
speed, maybe c/2.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:09.180
I expect you to get a speed
c/2.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:13.181
But you keep getting c.
You go three fourths of the

00:40:13.181 --> 00:40:15.638
velocity of light;
you still get the velocity of

00:40:15.638 --> 00:40:18.899
light.
That is very contrary to what

00:40:18.899 --> 00:40:21.722
we believe.
In fact, that's in violent

00:40:21.722 --> 00:40:25.257
opposition to this law here.
If this V were not a

00:40:25.257 --> 00:40:28.688
bullet but a light beam,
suppose for me traveling at a

00:40:28.688 --> 00:40:32.313
speed c and you're
traveling to the right at speed

00:40:32.313 --> 00:40:35.190
u,
you should get c - u.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:37.971
That's the inevitable
consequence of Newtonian

00:40:37.971 --> 00:40:40.380
physics.
And you don't get that.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:45.460
And that was a big problem.
So, people tried to fix it up

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:49.940
by doing different models of
ether, none of which worked.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:54.119
And nobody knew why light is
behaving in this peculiar

00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:58.219
fashion, so that's when Einstein
came in and said,

00:40:58.219 --> 00:41:00.940
"I know why light is behaving
in this peculiar fashion.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:04.736
It is behaving in this way
because if it didn't behave in

00:41:04.736 --> 00:41:09.210
this way, if the speed of light
depended on how fast I'm moving,

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:13.133
then when I wake up in this
train, all I have to do is

00:41:13.133 --> 00:41:18.230
measure the speed of light.
Originally, I got some number;

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:21.206
now I get to get a different
number and the difference will

00:41:21.206 --> 00:41:24.609
give me the speed of the train.
So, it would have been possible

00:41:24.609 --> 00:41:27.863
to detect the velocity of the
train without looking outside,

00:41:27.863 --> 00:41:30.179
just by doing an experiment
with light.

00:41:30.179 --> 00:41:34.873
So, even though mechanical laws
involving F = ma are the

00:41:34.873 --> 00:41:39.188
same, laws of electricity and
magnetism would be such that

00:41:39.188 --> 00:41:42.519
somehow they would betray your
velocity.

00:41:42.519 --> 00:41:46.475
And that would mean uniform
velocity does make an observable

00:41:46.475 --> 00:41:50.565
change because it changes the
velocity of light that you would

00:41:50.565 --> 00:41:52.504
measure.
" But conversely,

00:41:52.504 --> 00:41:56.242
the fact that you keep getting
the same answer means that

00:41:56.242 --> 00:42:00.247
electric and magnetic phenomena
are part of the conspiracy to

00:42:00.247 --> 00:42:03.550
hide your velocity.
Just like mechanical phenomena

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:06.385
won't tell you how fast you're
moving, neither will

00:42:06.385 --> 00:42:09.233
electromagnetic phenomena.
Because to Einstein,

00:42:09.233 --> 00:42:12.785
it was very obvious that nature
would not design a system in

00:42:12.785 --> 00:42:16.457
which mechanical laws are the
same but laws of electricity are

00:42:16.457 --> 00:42:19.469
different.
So, he postulated that all

00:42:19.469 --> 00:42:24.092
phenomena, whatever be their
nature, will be unaffected by

00:42:24.092 --> 00:42:28.959
going to a frame at constant
velocity relative to the initial

00:42:28.959 --> 00:42:31.539
one.
That's a very brave postulate

00:42:31.539 --> 00:42:35.237
because it even applies to
biological phenomena about which

00:42:35.237 --> 00:42:37.659
I'm sure Einstein knew very
little.

00:42:37.659 --> 00:42:41.265
But he believed that natural
phenomena will just follow

00:42:41.265 --> 00:42:44.670
either the principle of
relativity or they won't.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:50.639
And that is something you
should think about.

00:42:50.639 --> 00:42:52.489
Because that was the only
reason he had.

00:42:52.489 --> 00:42:54.939
He just said,
"I don't believe chapters 1

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:58.185
through 10 in our book obey
relativity and chapters 20

00:42:58.185 --> 00:43:00.880
through 30 where we do E&amp;M
doesn't."

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.044
These are all natural phenomena
that will obey the same

00:43:04.044 --> 00:43:07.033
principle, which says all
observers that are uniform

00:43:07.033 --> 00:43:09.260
relative to motion are
equivalent.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.355
Now, that's really based on a
lot of faith and even though

00:43:12.355 --> 00:43:15.449
scientists generally are opposed
to intelligent design,

00:43:15.449 --> 00:43:20.290
we all have some bias about the
way natural laws were designed;

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:22.869
there's no question about it.
You can talk to any practicing

00:43:22.869 --> 00:43:25.131
physicist.
We have a faith that underlying

00:43:25.131 --> 00:43:28.349
laws of nature will have a
certain elegance and a certain

00:43:28.349 --> 00:43:32.200
beauty and a certain uniformity
across all of natural phenomena.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.289
That is a faith that we have.
It's not a religious issue;

00:43:36.289 --> 00:43:38.789
otherwise, I wouldn't bring it
up in the classroom,

00:43:38.789 --> 00:43:41.289
but it is certainly the credo
of all scientists,

00:43:41.289 --> 00:43:45.384
at least all physicists,
that there is some elegance in

00:43:45.384 --> 00:43:50.010
the laws of nature and we put a
lot of money on that faith,

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.490
that the laws of nature will do
this and will not do this.

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:55.346
Who are we to say that?
Who are we to say nature

00:43:55.346 --> 00:43:58.556
wouldn't have a system in which
mechanics obeys the laws but

00:43:58.556 --> 00:44:00.570
electricity and magnetism
doesn't?

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.250
We haven't run into somebody
called nature.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:06.158
We don't worship a certain
deity called nature but we

00:44:06.158 --> 00:44:08.340
believe the laws of nature obey
that.

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:12.821
So, even though scientists or
physicists in particular may not

00:44:12.821 --> 00:44:15.760
believe in design by any
personal God,

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.281
they do believe in this
underlying, rational system that

00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:22.357
we are trying to uncover.
You could be disproven,

00:44:22.357 --> 00:44:24.875
you could be wrong in making
the assumption,

00:44:24.875 --> 00:44:28.244
but here it was right.
It was really driven by this

00:44:28.244 --> 00:44:32.393
notion that all laws of physics
should obey the same principle

00:44:32.393 --> 00:44:35.634
of relativity.
So, Einstein's postulates are

00:44:35.634 --> 00:44:39.947
that light behaves in this way
because if it didn't behave in

00:44:39.947 --> 00:44:43.081
this way,
it would violate the principle

00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:46.109
of relativity,
whereas we know mechanical

00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:50.273
phenomena do and electrical
phenomena would not and that

00:44:50.273 --> 00:44:53.139
cannot be the case.
You have a question?

00:44:53.139 --> 00:44:59.000
Student: Why would that
not apply to the speed of sound?

00:44:59.000 --> 00:44:59.840
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.585
Because in the case of the
speed of sound,

00:45:02.585 --> 00:45:04.929
you can take the medium with
you;

00:45:04.929 --> 00:45:07.239
there is no such experiment you
could perform.

00:45:07.239 --> 00:45:09.642
See, in the train,
if you could carry the ether

00:45:09.642 --> 00:45:12.880
with you, there's no surprise
you would get the same answer.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.116
But we know we cannot carry the
medium with us,

00:45:15.116 --> 00:45:17.449
that comes from
extra-terrestrial experiments.

00:45:17.449 --> 00:45:20.698
That's why the velocity of
sound is not elevated to a

00:45:20.698 --> 00:45:24.010
fundamental velocity on which
everybody will agree.

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:26.547
So, the two great
postulates--You've got to know

00:45:26.547 --> 00:45:31.190
where the postulates come from.
Postulate Number 1 is simply a

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:35.099
restatement of the relativity
principle.

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:36.980
I'll just say it in one
sentence.

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:42.601
Exact wording is not important.
All inertial observers are

00:45:42.601 --> 00:45:44.070
equivalent.

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:53.380
"Equivalent" means each one of
them is as privileged as any

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.619
other one to discover the laws
of nature.

00:45:56.619 --> 00:46:00.969
The laws of nature,
we found, are not an accident

00:46:00.969 --> 00:46:05.029
related to our state of motion.
If I find some laws,

00:46:05.029 --> 00:46:08.289
and you're moving relative to
me, you'll find the same laws.

00:46:08.289 --> 00:46:10.704
And if you and I find each
other in relative motion,

00:46:10.704 --> 00:46:13.639
you have as much right to claim
you are at rest and I am moving

00:46:13.639 --> 00:46:16.385
and I have as much right to
claim that I am at rest and you

00:46:16.385 --> 00:46:18.941
are moving.
There is complete symmetry

00:46:18.941 --> 00:46:22.039
between observers in uniform
relative motion.

00:46:22.039 --> 00:46:25.196
There is no symmetry between
people in non-uniform [relative]

00:46:25.196 --> 00:46:27.150
motion.
As I said, non-uniform motion

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:30.110
creates effects which can
destroy me and not destroy you.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:32.879
So, no one's trying to talk
their way out of acceleration,

00:46:32.879 --> 00:46:35.600
whereas you can talk your way
out of uniform velocity.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.825
That's the first principle.
So this was there even from the

00:46:38.825 --> 00:46:41.997
time of Newton.
What is true here is that all

00:46:41.997 --> 00:46:46.153
inertial observers are
equivalent with respect to all

00:46:46.153 --> 00:46:49.910
natural phenomena,
meaning all natural laws.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.478
And that is a generalization,
when we say "all" instead of

00:46:55.478 --> 00:46:56.220
just mechanical.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.291
And the Second Postulate,
you call it a postulate because

00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:06.960
there is just no way to deduce
this,

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:18.824
is that the velocity of light
is independent of the state of

00:47:18.824 --> 00:47:24.600
motion of the source,
of the observer, of everything.

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:32.699
If a light beam is emitted by a
moving rocket,

00:47:32.699 --> 00:47:35.313
it doesn't matter.
If a light beam is seen in a

00:47:35.313 --> 00:47:37.090
moving rocket,
it doesn't matter.

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:40.599
All people will get the same
answer for the velocity of

00:47:40.599 --> 00:47:42.540
light.
Student: Is there a

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.889
reason why the speed of light is
constant?

00:47:44.889 --> 00:47:45.440
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.937
That's why it is a postulate.
You can show a few things later

00:47:48.937 --> 00:47:50.651
on.
You can show that if there is

00:47:50.651 --> 00:47:52.529
any other speed,
which is the same for

00:47:52.529 --> 00:47:55.320
everybody, that would have to be
the speed of light.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.834
In the final theory of
relativity, there are not two or

00:47:58.834 --> 00:48:02.480
three velocities that come out
the same for everybody.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.840
There is only one velocity that
can have the same answer for all

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.201
people.
That velocity is the velocity

00:48:08.201 --> 00:48:10.598
of light.
By that I don't mean it has to

00:48:10.598 --> 00:48:12.155
be light itself.
For example,

00:48:12.155 --> 00:48:14.510
gravitational waves travel at
the speed of light.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:18.232
It's not just the light.
It has to do with the velocity

00:48:18.232 --> 00:48:21.730
of light being a single number
which has to have the same value

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:25.004
for everybody.
Okay, so it looks like he has

00:48:25.004 --> 00:48:29.951
solved a big problem because he
has said why light behaves this

00:48:29.951 --> 00:48:32.130
way;
light behaves this way because

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:35.210
it is part of the big conspiracy
to hide uniform motion.

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:41.384
But you will see that you have
made a terrible bargain because

00:48:41.384 --> 00:48:45.130
once you take these two
postulates,

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:48.210
you have restored the
relativity principle to all

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:50.050
phenomena.
Okay.

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:52.949
You've gone beyond mechanical
phenomena to electro-magnetic

00:48:52.949 --> 00:48:55.648
phenomena.
But you will find that you have

00:48:55.648 --> 00:48:59.305
to give up all the other
cherished notions of Newtonian

00:48:59.305 --> 00:49:02.059
physics.
Think about why.

00:49:02.059 --> 00:49:05.758
We are saying,
here is a car going at 200

00:49:05.758 --> 00:49:08.809
miles an hour,
according to me.

00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:12.519
You get into your own car and
follow that car at 50 miles an

00:49:12.519 --> 00:49:15.693
hour.
You should get 150 but you keep

00:49:15.693 --> 00:49:18.445
getting 200.
This may not be true for cars

00:49:18.445 --> 00:49:21.934
going at the speeds I mentioned
but when finally you are talking

00:49:21.934 --> 00:49:24.150
about a pulse of light,
that is true.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:28.205
And you've got to agree that is
really not compatible with our

00:49:28.205 --> 00:49:31.263
daily notions or with the
formula I wrote down,

00:49:31.263 --> 00:49:34.450
w = v - u.
When you put v = c,

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:37.550
w has got to come out to
be c.

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:40.650
And that's not a property of
the Newtonian transformation.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:44.528
So, what we are looking for is
a new rule for connecting

00:49:44.528 --> 00:49:48.194
x and t and
x prime and t

00:49:48.194 --> 00:49:50.919
prime,
such that when the velocities

00:49:50.919 --> 00:49:54.470
are computed and applied to the
velocity of light,

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:57.949
you get the same answer.
That's what we want to do now.

00:49:57.949 --> 00:50:01.010
So, here is how we are going to
do this.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:04.914
Now, let's think about it.
Let me send a pulse to the

00:50:04.914 --> 00:50:08.895
right at speed c.
You are going to the right at

00:50:08.895 --> 00:50:12.884
three-fourths of c.
My Newtonian expectation is,

00:50:12.884 --> 00:50:16.232
you should get the speed of the
pulse to be one-fourth of

00:50:16.232 --> 00:50:19.020
c.
But you insist it is c.

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.349
So, what will I say to you?
What will I accuse you of doing?

00:50:22.349 --> 00:50:26.389
I say you should get c/4
and you're getting c.

00:50:26.389 --> 00:50:29.874
And you're finding velocity by
finding the distance it travels

00:50:29.874 --> 00:50:33.243
and dividing by the time so you
are jacking up a number like

00:50:33.243 --> 00:50:35.700
one-fourth c to c
itself.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:39.510
So, what could make you do that?
Yep?

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:43.235
Student: If I perceive
that you're moving forward,

00:50:43.235 --> 00:50:45.630
or you're contracting your
length,

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:51.213
then you're going to measure
velocity keeping in mind you

00:50:51.213 --> 00:50:56.099
should have had a greater length
to begin with.

00:50:56.099 --> 00:50:56.650
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:58.929
So, one option--Let me repeat
what he said.

00:50:58.929 --> 00:51:03.610
I will say your meter sticks
are being somehow shorter.

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:06.329
When you and I were buddies and
were on the same train,

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:08.956
we agreed on the meter stick.
But now we have gone on the

00:51:08.956 --> 00:51:11.065
moving train.
I will say there is something

00:51:11.065 --> 00:51:13.690
wrong with your meter stick.
Not only something wrong.

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:15.182
Specifically,
I would say your meter sticks

00:51:15.182 --> 00:51:16.262
have shrunk.
For example,

00:51:16.262 --> 00:51:18.396
if they have shrunk to
one-fourth their size,

00:51:18.396 --> 00:51:21.258
it is very clear that you would
get a velocity of four times

00:51:21.258 --> 00:51:25.679
what I expect.
But there's another possibility.

00:51:25.679 --> 00:51:27.829
Student: Time may be
running slow.

00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:29.170
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Your clocks may be

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:30.828
running slow.
So, you let the light travel

00:51:30.828 --> 00:51:33.429
for four seconds and you thought
it was only one second.

00:51:33.429 --> 00:51:35.320
That's why you got four times
the answer;

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.820
or it could be both.
But something has to give.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:43.050
And that is why it is an
amazing theory.

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:46.839
That's why it is also amazing
to me that somebody who was 26

00:51:46.839 --> 00:51:50.628
years old would simply follow
the consequence of this theory

00:51:50.628 --> 00:51:54.096
and take it wherever it takes
you but it is at the very

00:51:54.096 --> 00:51:57.949
foundations of space and time
that you have to modify.

00:51:57.949 --> 00:52:00.447
So, even though you restored
the relativity principle and

00:52:00.447 --> 00:52:03.582
brought it back to the front,
the price you have to pay is to

00:52:03.582 --> 00:52:07.030
give up your notions that length
is length and time is time.

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:09.452
We used to think a meter stick
is a meter stick and a clock is

00:52:09.452 --> 00:52:11.317
a clock.
If I have a clock that ticks

00:52:11.317 --> 00:52:13.308
out one second,
you take it on a train,

00:52:13.308 --> 00:52:16.348
I expect it to be ticking one
second, but we're saying it's

00:52:16.348 --> 00:52:18.695
not.
So, something has to give in

00:52:18.695 --> 00:52:21.909
length measurement or time
measurement or both.

00:52:21.909 --> 00:52:24.449
And that's what we're going to
find out.

00:52:24.449 --> 00:52:26.659
So, here's how you find that
out.

00:52:26.659 --> 00:52:33.314
Let us say that--Maybe I'll do
it all on one blackboard because

00:52:33.314 --> 00:52:37.929
this is the key to the whole
calculation.

00:52:37.929 --> 00:52:42.379
You remember now,
if there is an event here,

00:52:42.379 --> 00:52:47.760
you call it x prime and
I call it x.

00:52:51.539 --> 00:52:53.588
And according to me,
you have traveled the distance

00:52:53.588 --> 00:52:54.080
ut.

00:52:59.909 --> 00:53:08.812
So, x prime equals x
- ut is what we used to say

00:53:08.812 --> 00:53:14.940
in the old days.
And the converse of that is

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:20.272
x = x prime + ut.
But now, we'll admit the fact

00:53:20.272 --> 00:53:22.840
that maybe t and t
prime are no longer the same.

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:31.015
But that's not all we will do.
I will say, whenever you give

00:53:31.015 --> 00:53:34.099
me a length x prime,
I just don't buy it.

00:53:34.099 --> 00:53:39.020
I take any length you give me
and I jack it up by a factor of

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:43.203
γ [correction:
should have said 1/γ]

00:53:43.203 --> 00:53:46.320
to get the length according to
me.

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.191
And you will take any answer I
give you and you will multiply

00:53:50.191 --> 00:53:53.840
it by the same factor.
Don't worry about this yet!]

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.840
In other words,
we don't buy our units of

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.473
length,
so if you say it should be

00:53:59.473 --> 00:54:03.241
x prime + ut
prime, that's your formula

00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:06.072
backwards for me.
The coordinate of the event,

00:54:06.072 --> 00:54:07.701
according to you,
in the old days,

00:54:07.701 --> 00:54:10.869
was x prime + ut.
Now, we admit that t and

00:54:10.869 --> 00:54:12.599
t prime may not be the
same.

00:54:12.599 --> 00:54:14.964
Then we say,
but I will not take your

00:54:14.964 --> 00:54:18.906
lengths, I will multiply them by
γ to get the lengths

00:54:18.906 --> 00:54:21.542
according to me.
And you will not take my

00:54:21.542 --> 00:54:23.967
expectations,
but you will multiply it by the

00:54:23.967 --> 00:54:27.045
same γ;
that is the symmetry between

00:54:27.045 --> 00:54:29.015
the two observers.
In other words,

00:54:29.015 --> 00:54:30.905
if I think your meter sticks
are short and γ

00:54:30.905 --> 00:54:32.425
[correction: should have said
1/γ]

00:54:32.425 --> 00:54:35.122
is a number less than 1,
I'm allowing you to accuse me

00:54:35.122 --> 00:54:37.360
of having meter sticks which are
short.

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.133
It is very interesting.
If I said your meter sticks are

00:54:40.133 --> 00:54:43.082
short and you say my meter
sticks are longer than average,

00:54:43.082 --> 00:54:46.434
that's an absolute difference.
But we both accuse each other

00:54:46.434 --> 00:54:49.892
of using shortened meter sticks,
and so we use the same factor

00:54:49.892 --> 00:54:53.025
of γ.
We are going to find this

00:54:53.025 --> 00:54:56.796
γ now.
Student: How do you know

00:54:56.796 --> 00:55:00.489
that both the distance and time
are different?

00:55:00.489 --> 00:55:03.151
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: We'll give it the

00:55:03.151 --> 00:55:05.966
possibility that they are
different and then we will see

00:55:05.966 --> 00:55:08.530
that they are different.
We know something's wrong with

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:10.000
space and something's wrong with
time.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.155
So, we'll not assume that
t prime is equal to

00:55:12.155 --> 00:55:13.731
t.
You have to open up the

00:55:13.731 --> 00:55:15.969
possibility.
In the end, it may be that the

00:55:15.969 --> 00:55:18.921
nature will say t prime
is t and something

00:55:18.921 --> 00:55:22.018
happens to length alone.
But we'll find the answer is

00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:27.131
more symmetric.
Student: Why do we say

00:55:27.131 --> 00:55:32.373
that the symmetry is the same?
Professor Ramamurti

00:55:32.373 --> 00:55:34.367
Shankar: Because that is the
symmetry between the two

00:55:34.367 --> 00:55:37.427
observers.
If I want to say your meter

00:55:37.427 --> 00:55:41.949
sticks are short,
why should you concede that?

00:55:41.949 --> 00:55:43.976
You should be able to accuse me
of saying--The only difference

00:55:43.976 --> 00:55:45.836
between you and me is you are
moving to the right and I'm

00:55:45.836 --> 00:55:48.109
moving to the left.
Other than the sign of the

00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:51.708
velocity, each person says the
other person is moving and so we

00:55:51.708 --> 00:55:55.075
will say that any length you
give I'll discount by a factor

00:55:55.075 --> 00:55:56.644
of γ.
By symmetry,

00:55:56.644 --> 00:55:59.004
anything I call a length,
you will discount by the same

00:55:59.004 --> 00:56:02.639
factor of γ.
Now, let's apply this.

00:56:02.639 --> 00:56:04.390
(x,t) was a
certain event,

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:06.479
right?
Let's apply it to the following

00:56:06.479 --> 00:56:07.975
event.
You have to follow this very

00:56:07.975 --> 00:56:10.014
carefully.
When you and I crossed,

00:56:10.014 --> 00:56:13.224
remember that was at the origin
of coordinates,

00:56:13.224 --> 00:56:16.991
x equals to t
equals to zero and x

00:56:16.991 --> 00:56:20.550
prime equals to t prime
equals to zero.

00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:23.231
At that instant when our
origins touched,

00:56:23.231 --> 00:56:27.407
let us emit a flash of light.
Okay, maybe when the origins

00:56:27.407 --> 00:56:31.454
touched, there's a spark,
the light signal goes out and

00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:35.800
the light signal is detected
here, by a light detector.

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:41.765
That second event,
detection of the pulse,

00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:49.039
it has a coordinates
(x,t) for me;

00:56:49.039 --> 00:56:54.429
it has a coordinates (x
prime, t prime) for you.

00:56:54.429 --> 00:56:58.050
The same event is given
different coordinates.

00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:00.365
We've already used the fact
that coordinates will be

00:57:00.365 --> 00:57:03.181
different but we are saying not
only will x prime not be

00:57:03.181 --> 00:57:05.316
equal to x;
t prime may not be equal

00:57:05.316 --> 00:57:06.050
to t either.

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:15.360
Okay, but now let's write down
one important condition.

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.542
What is the relation between
x prime and t

00:57:17.542 --> 00:57:19.210
prime in this particular pair of
events?

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:27.314
What is x prime?
It is the location of the light

00:57:27.314 --> 00:57:30.820
pulse after certain time?
So, what's the relation of the

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:34.460
location of the detection of the
light pulse and the time

00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:39.690
t prime?
Yes?

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:43.496
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:57:43.496 --> 00:57:47.536
Shankar: He is saying
x prime--Do you guys

00:57:47.536 --> 00:57:50.223
understand that?
Do you agree with that

00:57:50.223 --> 00:57:52.429
statement?
This is not a random event.

00:57:52.429 --> 00:57:55.659
The second event was the
detection of a light pulse.

00:57:55.659 --> 00:57:59.272
Light pulse left the origin
t prime seconds earlier

00:57:59.272 --> 00:58:02.337
and has come to this point,
according to this guy,

00:58:02.337 --> 00:58:05.628
and the ratio of the distance
to the time is the velocity of

00:58:05.628 --> 00:58:08.306
light.
But it is also true that for

00:58:08.306 --> 00:58:12.969
me, the light went to distance
x in a time t.

00:58:12.969 --> 00:58:17.377
So, that's the relation of
x to t for me

00:58:17.377 --> 00:58:20.427
also.
I'm going to use those two

00:58:20.427 --> 00:58:26.217
results and combine it with this
to find this factor γ

00:58:26.217 --> 00:58:30.593
and we will do that now.
I want you to multiply the

00:58:30.593 --> 00:58:34.919
left-hand side by the left-hand
side and the right-hand side by

00:58:34.919 --> 00:58:37.710
the right-hand side of that
equation.

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:41.050
I hope you understand that in
the Galilean days,

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:44.389
in the old days--Let's see what
you will say.

00:58:44.389 --> 00:58:46.841
I will say, x prime is
x - ut because the

00:58:46.841 --> 00:58:48.929
origins have shifted by an
amount ut.

00:58:48.929 --> 00:58:51.853
And you will say x is
x prime plus ut

00:58:51.853 --> 00:58:53.985
with the same time.
Now, I'm saying time is

00:58:53.985 --> 00:58:55.261
different.
Not only that,

00:58:55.261 --> 00:58:58.575
I don't buy your length.
If you expect me to have this

00:58:58.575 --> 00:59:01.210
length, I say "no."
You exaggerated everything.

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:03.969
I'll scale it down by γ
and vice versa.

00:59:03.969 --> 00:59:07.115
So, if you multiply the
left-hand side by the left-hand

00:59:07.115 --> 00:59:11.726
side, you get xx prime,
the right-hand side you get

00:59:11.726 --> 00:59:17.424
γ^(2) times xx
prime plus uxt prime

00:59:17.424 --> 00:59:23.630
minus ux prime t
minus u^(2)tt prime.

00:59:30.769 --> 00:59:35.630
Now, divide everything by
xx prime.

00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:41.300
Then, you get 1 = γ^(2)
times 1 + u.

00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:44.338
If you divide this by xx
prime, you'll get t prime

00:59:44.338 --> 00:59:48.250
over x prime.
If you divide this by xx

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:52.903
prime, you'll get t/x.
And here you get u^(2)

00:59:52.903 --> 00:59:55.644
times t/x,
times t prime over

00:59:55.644 --> 00:59:56.820
x prime.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.824
So, what does that mean?
Well, t prime over

01:00:10.824 --> 01:00:15.324
x prime is 1/c and
t/x is also

01:00:15.324 --> 01:00:18.719
1/c because of what I
wrote here.

01:00:18.719 --> 01:00:20.733
If you want,
let me write this as t

01:00:20.733 --> 01:00:23.779
prime over x prime equals
the c and t over

01:00:23.779 --> 01:00:26.969
x equals the c.
So, they will cancel.

01:00:26.969 --> 01:00:31.569
And I'll get 1 = γ^(2)
times 1 - u^(2) over

01:00:31.569 --> 01:00:36.007
c^(2) because this
t/x is a 1/c and

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:40.930
t prime over x
prime is another 1/c.

01:00:44.949 --> 01:00:50.776
So, that gives us the result
that γ is 1 over square

01:00:50.776 --> 01:00:55.220
root of 1 - u^(2) over
c^(2).

01:01:00.889 --> 01:01:05.660
If you plug the γ back
in, you will find x prime

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.969
is x - ut divided by
[square root of]

01:01:08.969 --> 01:01:11.970
1 - u^(2) over
c^(2).

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.758
Now, once you do that,
once you got the relation

01:01:24.758 --> 01:01:27.509
between x prime and
x, you can go to the

01:01:27.509 --> 01:01:30.000
lower equation and solve for
t prime.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.698
I don't feel like doing that.
It's a simple algebraic

01:01:33.698 --> 01:01:36.517
equation once you've got
x prime how to solve for

01:01:36.517 --> 01:01:38.645
t prime.
Take the second of the two

01:01:38.645 --> 01:01:40.500
equations and solve for t
prime.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:45.326
That detail I won't fill out,
but you will get t prime

01:01:45.326 --> 01:01:49.590
is t - ux over
c^(2) divided by this.

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:52.889
So, I've not done every step
but I've given you all the

01:01:52.889 --> 01:01:55.150
things you need to do the one
step.

01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:57.650
There are equations up there
that relate x and

01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:00.631
x prime to t and
t prime so if you can get

01:02:00.631 --> 01:02:03.179
x prime in terms of
x and t,

01:02:03.179 --> 01:02:05.414
the other equation that you
solve will give you t

01:02:05.414 --> 01:02:07.120
prime in terms of x and
t.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.540
And this is the result.

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:15.952
Okay.
This guy deserves two boxes

01:02:15.952 --> 01:02:21.000
because it is the greatest
result from relativity;

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.440
it's called the Lorentz
transformation.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:28.474
And we've been able to derive
the Lorentz transformation with

01:02:28.474 --> 01:02:30.953
what little we know.
And you can see,

01:02:30.953 --> 01:02:33.050
you can be a kid in high school
and you can do this.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.951
There's no calculus or anything
else involved,

01:02:35.951 --> 01:02:39.756
other than being open to the
fact that the velocity of light

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:44.309
behaves in this strange way.
Yes?

01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:48.329
Student: How do you get
t/x = c?

01:02:48.329 --> 01:02:49.666
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Why is t/x =

01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:51.489
c?
Oh, of course,

01:02:51.489 --> 01:02:56.719
you're quite right.
So, you caught the mistake here.

01:02:56.719 --> 01:03:00.590
t/x is 1 over c
and 1/c.

01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:02.960
I really meant to write x =
ct.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.963
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

01:03:05.963 --> 01:03:09.449
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No.

01:03:09.449 --> 01:03:13.810
If you define γ to be
the absolute value by which you

01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:18.315
transfer lengths from you to me,
then you can take the positive

01:03:18.315 --> 01:03:19.663
root.
Student: [inaudible]

01:03:19.663 --> 01:03:20.690
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Well,

01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:21.640
I can also tell you other
reasons.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:26.926
Let's take this formula here.
Let's take the case where the

01:03:26.926 --> 01:03:30.659
velocity is very small compared
to the velocity of light.

01:03:30.659 --> 01:03:33.110
That u/c is a very small
number.

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:36.751
This number is almost 1 and I
get x prime because x

01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:40.089
- ut, which I know to be the
correct answer at lower

01:03:40.089 --> 01:03:42.753
velocities.
If you pick the minus sign,

01:03:42.753 --> 01:03:46.131
I'll get minus of x -
ut, that's not the right

01:03:46.131 --> 01:03:49.119
answer, not even close to the
right answer.

01:03:49.119 --> 01:03:52.608
At low velocities,
if you go to velocity u

01:03:52.608 --> 01:03:56.824
over c much less than 1,
you have got to get back to

01:03:56.824 --> 01:04:00.507
Galilean transformation.
You can see if u over

01:04:00.507 --> 01:04:03.703
c goes to zero.
You can forget all about this

01:04:03.703 --> 01:04:05.823
factor here.
You get x prime is

01:04:05.823 --> 01:04:08.877
x - ut and here,
u over c can be

01:04:08.877 --> 01:04:10.632
neglected,
forget all that,

01:04:10.632 --> 01:04:13.340
you get t prime equals
t.

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.313
So, this coordinate
transformation would reduce to

01:04:17.313 --> 01:04:22.259
the Galilean transformation if
the velocity between me and you

01:04:22.259 --> 01:04:26.070
is much smaller than the
velocity of light.

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:30.267
So, the formula really kicks in
for velocities comparable to

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:35.820
velocity of light.
Yes?

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.081
Student: [inaudible]
What happens if u &gt;

01:04:38.081 --> 01:04:39.114
c?
Professor Ramamurti

01:04:39.114 --> 01:04:40.389
Shankar: Well,
you start getting crazy

01:04:40.389 --> 01:04:42.807
answers, right?
You can already see that the

01:04:42.807 --> 01:04:46.722
theory will not admit velocities
bigger than the velocity of

01:04:46.722 --> 01:04:48.681
light.
You can already see it in this

01:04:48.681 --> 01:04:50.819
formula.
That tells you that the one

01:04:50.819 --> 01:04:54.791
single velocity that you wanted
to be the same for everybody is

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:57.289
also the greatest possible
velocity;

01:04:57.289 --> 01:05:00.804
that no observer can move at
this speed with respect to

01:05:00.804 --> 01:05:04.513
another observer that is equal
to what is in excess of the

01:05:04.513 --> 01:05:06.913
speed of light.
So, the speed of light,

01:05:06.913 --> 01:05:10.150
which came out to be a constant
in the beginning of the theory,

01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:13.213
is also turning out to be the
upper limit on possible

01:05:13.213 --> 01:05:15.525
velocities.
That's the origin of the

01:05:15.525 --> 01:05:19.323
statement that no observer can
travel at a speed bigger than

01:05:19.323 --> 01:05:22.219
light, but we'll discuss it more
and more.

01:05:22.219 --> 01:05:26.743
But you have to understand what
it is that is being derived,

01:05:26.743 --> 01:05:30.040
what is the meaning of this
formula here.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:33.007
What is it telling you?
If I say, this is called the

01:05:33.007 --> 01:05:36.460
Lorenz transformations,
what do they tell you?

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:40.820
What are these numbers and
what's their significance?

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:44.122
Would you like to try?
Student: Well,

01:05:44.122 --> 01:05:47.197
one thing that they tell you is
if u happens to be

01:05:47.197 --> 01:05:48.954
greater than c
[inaudible]

01:05:48.954 --> 01:05:51.369
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

01:05:51.369 --> 01:05:54.580
no, I don't mean what happens
in the formula in special cases.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:57.569
What is it relating?
What is xt and what is

01:05:57.569 --> 01:06:00.995
x prime t prime?
Student:

01:06:00.995 --> 01:06:07.216
Okay, so x prime would
be the distance that the person

01:06:07.216 --> 01:06:12.089
who's traveling at the higher
speed experiences.

01:06:12.089 --> 01:06:16.029
And [inaudible]
and so for that person,

01:06:16.029 --> 01:06:20.280
distance is going to seem
shorter?

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.340
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No.

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.123
See, I'm not even telling you
to get consequences of the

01:06:25.123 --> 01:06:27.700
equation.
What are the numbers x

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.829
and t in this equation?
And what are the numbers

01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:32.929
x prime and t
prime in this equation?

01:06:32.929 --> 01:06:36.723
Student: x and
t are distance and time

01:06:36.723 --> 01:06:40.190
for a person who is in an
inertial frame of reference,

01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:42.038
who is not moving.
Professor Ramamurti

01:06:42.038 --> 01:06:43.535
Shankar: Right.
Student: And x

01:06:43.535 --> 01:06:45.947
prime and t prime are
distance and time for the person

01:06:45.947 --> 01:06:47.555
who is moving at the speed of
[inaudible]

01:06:47.555 --> 01:06:49.605
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: And when you say

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:51.615
distance and time,
what do you mean,

01:06:51.615 --> 01:06:54.549
distance and time?
Student: The way that

01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:58.619
the length of the distance will
seem to them that they travel.

01:06:58.619 --> 01:06:59.876
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: But what is

01:06:59.876 --> 01:07:03.159
happening at xt;
it's the coordinates of what?

01:07:03.159 --> 01:07:04.920
Student: Of their
location [inaudible]

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.079
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: They are located at

01:07:07.079 --> 01:07:09.190
zero, zero.
Right?

01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:10.500
What's happening at x
and t?

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:15.303
Yes?
Student: It's observing

01:07:15.303 --> 01:07:17.092
the event.
Professor Ramamurti

01:07:17.092 --> 01:07:19.308
Shankar: It's the event.
The key I was looking for is an

01:07:19.308 --> 01:07:21.248
event.
You've got to understand what

01:07:21.248 --> 01:07:25.218
the formula is connecting.
Things are happening in space

01:07:25.218 --> 01:07:28.659
and in time, right?
Something happens here.

01:07:28.659 --> 01:07:31.997
That something has a spatial
coordinate and a time

01:07:31.997 --> 01:07:34.789
coordinate, according to two
observers.

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:38.263
The observers originally had
their origins and their clocks

01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:41.510
coincide when they passed;
that's how they're related.

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:43.880
And one is moving to the right
at speed u.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.848
Then, the claim is that if one
event had a coordinate x

01:07:47.848 --> 01:07:51.235
and t for one person,
for the other person moving to

01:07:51.235 --> 01:07:53.772
the right at speed u,
the same event would have

01:07:53.772 --> 01:07:56.692
coordinates x prime and
t prime and the relation

01:07:56.692 --> 01:07:59.564
between x and t
and x prime and t

01:07:59.564 --> 01:08:03.530
prime is this.
Yes?

01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:07.815
Student: The two
observers [inaudible]

01:08:07.815 --> 01:08:12.491
don't they observe different
laws and [inaudible]

01:08:12.491 --> 01:08:16.680
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.792
The fact that an event has
different coordinates doesn't

01:08:19.792 --> 01:08:22.340
mean that you are observing
different laws.

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.927
For example,
let's take that fire

01:08:24.927 --> 01:08:27.194
extinguisher.
We look at it,

01:08:27.194 --> 01:08:29.829
it's obeying F = ma,
right?

01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:32.591
The coordinates of the fire
extinguisher with me as the

01:08:32.591 --> 01:08:35.199
origin is quite different from
you as the origin.

01:08:35.199 --> 01:08:44.224
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:08:44.224 --> 01:08:52.880
Shankar: You mean in these
new equations?

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.940
Yes, in these new equations,
F = ma will not work;

01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:58.540
that's correct.
Student: They are

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.479
inertial references,
even though they are moving?

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:01.310
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Ah.

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:04.294
Yes.
So, the point is the laws of

01:09:04.294 --> 01:09:07.350
Newton themselves have to be
modified.

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:11.702
F = ma will be modified
in a certain way but the new

01:09:11.702 --> 01:09:16.430
modified laws will reduce to
F = ma at low velocities,

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:19.529
which is why in the old days it
looked like F = ma.

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:22.607
But there will be new laws,
but they will also have the

01:09:22.607 --> 01:09:26.026
property that when I measure
them I'll get the laws that will

01:09:26.026 --> 01:09:29.239
agree with what you measure.
Yes?

01:09:29.239 --> 01:09:34.430
Student: Does individual
values for time or distance

01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:37.221
still have to agree?
Professor Ramamurti

01:09:37.221 --> 01:09:39.574
Shankar: The coordinates of
an event will differ from person

01:09:39.574 --> 01:09:42.038
to person.
That's not the same as saying

01:09:42.038 --> 01:09:44.699
the laws as deduced will be
different.

01:09:44.699 --> 01:09:46.490
For example,
there are two stars which are

01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:48.673
attracted to each other by
gravitation and they are

01:09:48.673 --> 01:09:50.770
orbiting around their common
center of mass.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:52.626
If I see them,
I will find that they obey the

01:09:52.626 --> 01:09:54.313
law of gravitation with
m_1m

01:09:54.313 --> 01:09:56.464
_2 over
r^(2) where r is

01:09:56.464 --> 01:09:59.122
the distance between the points
and the acceleration is whatever

01:09:59.122 --> 01:10:01.783
I think it is.
You can go on a rocket and look

01:10:01.783 --> 01:10:04.227
at the same two stars.
They will be in a more

01:10:04.227 --> 01:10:06.806
complicated motion,
maybe the whole system will be

01:10:06.806 --> 01:10:09.866
drifting a little to you,
but their acceleration will be

01:10:09.866 --> 01:10:13.091
the same as what I get and the
force between them will also be

01:10:13.091 --> 01:10:16.211
the same as what I get and the
laws that you would deduce by

01:10:16.211 --> 01:10:19.119
looking at that star would be
the same laws that I would

01:10:19.119 --> 01:10:21.641
deduce.
So, that's a difference between

01:10:21.641 --> 01:10:25.090
the laws being the same and the
coordinates being the same.

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:28.071
No one said x prime and
x are the same in that

01:10:28.071 --> 01:10:29.909
equation there.
They are different.

01:10:29.909 --> 01:10:31.600
We are looking at it from
different vantage points.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.376
But the fact is that force is
equal to mass times acceleration

01:10:36.376 --> 01:10:41.489
is the same for the two people.
Okay.

01:10:41.489 --> 01:10:44.000
The laws will be the same but
things won't look the same.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.861
For example,
you can stand on your head,

01:10:45.861 --> 01:10:48.439
don't even have to go to
another frame of reference;

01:10:48.439 --> 01:10:50.514
you can stand on your head,
your z coordinate is the

01:10:50.514 --> 01:10:52.713
minus of my z coordinate;
to every point I give a

01:10:52.713 --> 01:10:54.510
z, you will give a minus
z.

01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:56.580
But the world,
even though you are a little

01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.699
messed up and want to stand on
your head,

01:10:58.699 --> 01:11:01.752
you have every right to do that
and you will find that F =

01:11:01.752 --> 01:11:03.513
ma.
So the point is,

01:11:03.513 --> 01:11:07.587
the way we see events may
depend on their origin or

01:11:07.587 --> 01:11:10.452
coordinates,
but the laws we deduce are to

01:11:10.452 --> 01:11:13.340
be distinguished from the
perception that we have.

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:15.472
Okay?
For example,

01:11:15.472 --> 01:11:18.070
if I'm on the ground,
I send a piece of chalk,

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:21.025
it goes up and it goes down.
If you see me from a moving

01:11:21.025 --> 01:11:23.010
train, you would think it went
on a parabola.

01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:25.970
So, no one says the chalk will
go up and down for you.

01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:30.478
For you, it will go like this
but its motion will still obey

01:11:30.478 --> 01:11:33.229
F = ma,
is what I'm saying.

01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:37.090
That's all you really mean by
saying things look the same.

01:11:37.090 --> 01:11:41.324
So, what you have to understand
is that Lorentz transformations

01:11:41.324 --> 01:11:45.080
are the way to relate a pair of
events, given events.

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.928
Here's a simple example.
If you live in the xy

01:11:47.928 --> 01:11:50.234
plane, there's a point here.
It's not an event,

01:11:50.234 --> 01:11:52.079
it's simply a point in the
xy plane.

01:11:52.079 --> 01:11:54.885
You measure it this way and
that way and you call it the

01:11:54.885 --> 01:11:57.345
coordinates.
If somebody else picks a

01:11:57.345 --> 01:12:01.199
different coordinate system with
an angle θ,

01:12:01.199 --> 01:12:04.439
that person will say that's
x prime and that is

01:12:04.439 --> 01:12:08.045
y prime and x
prime and y prime are not

01:12:08.045 --> 01:12:09.575
the same.
I remind you,

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:12.460
x prime is x cos&gt;
θ [delete "minus

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.214
y"]
plus y sin θ,

01:12:14.214 --> 01:12:16.930
etc., and y prime is
something else.

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:19.720
θ is the angle between
the two observers.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:23.031
So, the point is the point.
It certainly looks different to

01:12:23.031 --> 01:12:25.322
the two people,
but the same point has two

01:12:25.322 --> 01:12:27.707
coordinates.
Similarly, the same event,

01:12:27.707 --> 01:12:31.339
like the collision of two cars,
will have different events for

01:12:31.339 --> 01:12:34.119
different people.
That's not the new part.

01:12:34.119 --> 01:12:37.865
The new part is that the rules
for connecting xt to

01:12:37.865 --> 01:12:41.479
x't', is quite different
from the Galilean rules,

01:12:41.479 --> 01:12:43.679
new rules.
It's what you guys have to

01:12:43.679 --> 01:12:45.060
understand.
And finally,

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:49.146
why did Einstein get the credit
for turning the world into four

01:12:49.146 --> 01:12:52.465
dimensions instead of three?
After all, x and

01:12:52.465 --> 01:12:54.350
t were present there,
too.

01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:56.628
The point is,
t prime is always equal

01:12:56.628 --> 01:12:58.590
to t no matter how you
move,

01:12:58.590 --> 01:13:01.361
whereas in the Einstein theory,
x and t get

01:13:01.361 --> 01:13:04.331
scrambled into x prime
and t prime just the way

01:13:04.331 --> 01:13:07.053
x and y get
scrambled into each other when

01:13:07.053 --> 01:13:10.102
you rotate your axis.
So, to have time as another

01:13:10.102 --> 01:13:14.097
variable that doesn't transform
at all is not the same as making

01:13:14.097 --> 01:13:17.045
it into a coordinate.
The four-dimensional world of

01:13:17.045 --> 01:13:19.945
Einstein is four-dimensional
because space and time mix with

01:13:19.945 --> 01:13:22.600
each other when you change your
frame of reference.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.414
That's what makes t now
a coordinate as previously it

01:13:26.414 --> 01:13:29.000
was something the same for all
people.

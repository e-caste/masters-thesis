00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.930
PROFESSOR: So we have quite a
bit to do in lecture today,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.820
but there are two main things
that are going to happen.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.580
The first is that I finish up
the discussion of Aristotle's

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.255
views on happiness and harmony,
and the second is

00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:19.086
that I want to introduce
you to the topic of

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:20.220
the disordered soul.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.840
And for the second part
of the lecture, we'll

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.410
be using our clickers.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.640
You do want to make sure you
have them out within the next,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.010
I don't know, eight
minutes or so.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.146
So as you may recall, what we
were talking about in the last

00:00:36.146 --> 00:00:41.460
lecture was this ancient idea
that there's a certain sort of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.760
thriving that's available
to human beings.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.536
A certain sort of flourishing,
a certain sort of what the

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:51.740
Greeks called eudaimonia,
available to people whose

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.900
souls exhibit a certain
kind of harmony.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.308
And you recall that the ancient
picture as articulated

00:00:59.308 --> 00:01:03.530
in Plato and taken on in many
ways by Aristotle, was that we

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.510
have reason, rationality.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.640
We have spirit, a set of
emotions that are concerned

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.420
with things like honor.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.890
And we have appetite, which are
concerned with things like

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.140
the consumption of food and the
procreation that allows

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.108
our species to continue, and
the procreation that allows

00:01:21.108 --> 00:01:22.605
our species to continue and the
procreation for the sake

00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:24.805
of doing procreation.

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:29.230
And that the person who is in
a position to thrive or

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.190
flourish is the person whose
instinct in the domain of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.043
appetite and in the domain of
emotions are in line with his

00:01:40.043 --> 00:01:43.030
or her reflective commitments.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.540
That is, somebody who acts
automatically in the way that

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.920
he or she would like to
act reflectively.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.410
The person who instinctively
sits down and does her reading

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.110
when she's committed
to do her reading.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.762
The person who instinctively
avoids the chocolate cake when

00:02:01.762 --> 00:02:04.160
she's presented with the
chocolate cake, if that's what

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.280
she's committed to do.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.255
So what Aristotle tried to
do in the segment of the

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:14.060
Nicomachean Ethics that we read
is to give us a formula,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.559
a strategy, a method, for
getting to the point of having

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:20.690
our soul in order.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.170
And just to remind you where
this fits in the context of

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.466
his argument, the claim that
Aristotle makes is that

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:32.393
there's one sort of thing that
we pursue for its own sake,

00:02:32.393 --> 00:02:34.690
and it's exactly the thing
that I just referred to.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.390
It's this flourishing
or eudaimonia.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.767
It's this feeling that one
is living up to the

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:44.652
greatest one can be.

00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:47.980
And Aristotle points out that
the sort of flourishing that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.370
we're interested in here is
not the gratification that

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.060
comes from satisfying one's
lower appetite.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.306
It's not the gratification that
comes from satisfying the

00:02:58.306 --> 00:03:01.130
demands that honor or
spirit give us.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.450
But rather, it's the
gratification that comes from

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.048
making use of our capacity
as reflective beings.

00:03:09.048 --> 00:03:12.020
And you have an argument for
that which I went over at the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.385
end of last lecture, which is
that for each object, there is

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:20.935
something that is special
about it, something with

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:24.250
respect to which it has
properties that the rest of

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.100
the objects in the
world don't.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.170
And the special function of a
human being, says Aristotle,

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.470
is the expression of reason.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.490
"The soul's activity that
expresses reason," in one of

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.220
the standard translations.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.058
So the human good on the
Aristotelian picture has got

00:03:43.058 --> 00:03:46.985
to be the thing about human
beings that sets them apart

00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:49.530
from other sorts of creatures.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.210
The other sorts of creatures
have the kind of lower

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.716
appetites that we've
described.

00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:57.800
In fact, almost every biological
being seems to have

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.649
something like what Plato would
call an appetitive part

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:01.436
of the soul.

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:06.890
And it appears that a number of
non-human animals also have

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.830
what Plato and Aristotle would
call the spirited part of the

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.472
soul, at least in some ways.

00:04:12.472 --> 00:04:15.450
They have emotional connections
that seem to be

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.450
manifest in their behavior.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.280
But the best and most complete
distinctly human virtue, says

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.708
Aristotle, is the capacity
to engage in reason.

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:32.400
And the capacity to engage
in reflection.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.816
And the capacity, then, to
structure one's life in such a

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:42.500
way that spirit and appetite
fall into line with reason.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.989
So virtue on Aristotle's picture
is being such that

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:53.370
your instinctive responses
fall into line with your

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.070
reflective commitments.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.296
It's being such that what
happens to you in moments

00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:03.085
where you're not paying
attention to your behavior is

00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:07.090
the sort of behavior that you
would look back on and say,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.520
"Wow, I'm so glad that in the
moment of crisis, what I did

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.530
was help that child".

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.270
Or, "what I did was avoided
that temptation that would

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.246
have led me to do something that
I would have disavowed".

00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:24.440
So the question that Aristotle's
concerned with, in

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.050
the pages that we read, is a
question of what that virtue

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.230
looks like, and how that sort of
virtue might be cultivated.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.910
The virtue, to remind you, is
exactly the virtue that Plato

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.930
called the virtue of justice.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.900
It's the virtue of there being
a certain kind of harmony

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.140
among what they call the parts
of the soul, and that harmony

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.860
being such that it's a harmony
we would reflectively endorse.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.860
Now I'm going to go relatively
quickly through the next two

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.500
slides, exactly because we're
going to come back to this

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.456
issue in Aristotle
two more times in

00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:03.030
the next three lectures.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.090
In lots of ways, this unit of
the course is going to attempt

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.189
to provide an exposition of
Aristotle's insights.

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:12.970
This is attempt number one to
introduce it to you, and

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.700
you're going to get
it twice more.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.900
Aristotle distinguishes between
two kinds of virtue:

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.138
there's virtues of thought
and virtues of character.

00:06:25.138 --> 00:06:29.110
Virtues of thought are things
that grow through

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.010
straightforward pedagogical
instruction.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.116
So it's a virtue of thought
to know that six

00:06:35.116 --> 00:06:37.670
times seven is forty-two.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.340
It's a virtue of thought to know
facts about the periodic

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.920
table, or to know information of
a particular kind about the

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.750
political structures
around you.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.340
Those are virtues of thought,
and the way that virtues of

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.220
thought are communicated to
others and cultivated in

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:01.190
others is through a process
of traditional pedagogy.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.900
But one of the crucial themes
of the ancient philosophical

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.960
tradition is that in addition
to virtues of thought, there

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.310
are what Aristotle called
virtues of character.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.944
Virtues of character aren't
things that you process

00:07:20.944 --> 00:07:24.430
rationally and come to acquire
as the result of somebody

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.330
telling them to you.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.183
They are things that you process
in the spirited and

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:35.110
appetitive parts of your soul
as the result of a kind of

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.444
cultivation of habit.

00:07:38.444 --> 00:07:43.730
Aristotle says of these virtues
of character that they

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:49.010
arise in us neither by nature
nor against nature.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.850
What does he mean by that?

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.500
Well, suppose I was trying to
train my glasses to stay in

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.410
the air when I let go of them.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.380
Would I have much success?

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.190
I could keep rewarding them
every time they stay in the

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.416
air, and I'll scold them every
time they fall on the ground.

00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:10.796
No matter how many times I try
to train my glasses to stay in

00:08:10.796 --> 00:08:14.010
the air, they will fall
to the ground.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.040
It is against their nature.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.170
It is impossible to change the
relationship between my

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.040
glasses and the gravitational
force in the world.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.190
Aristotle makes the point
speaking of a stone.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:32.370
It's impossible to change the
character of the glasses.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.030
By contrast, if I take a pumpkin
seed, and I put it in

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.400
some soil, and I put water in
it, and I put it out in the

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:45.070
sunshine, then even with no
intervention on my part, the

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.400
pumpkin seed will give rise to
a pumpkin sprout that will

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.810
come out of the soil and move
towards the sunlight in such a

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.070
way that eventually it will
form a pumpkin plant.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.380
So if I plant the pumpkin seed,
then by nature, it will

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:04.420
become, without my intervention,
a pumpkin plant.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.660
Virtues of character lie in
between what a pumpkin seed

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.250
does for a pumpkin plant and
what trying to train you

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.600
glasses does, given gravity.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.590
They arise in us neither
by nature--

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.810
they don't grow out of us
naturally in the way that our

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.450
height grows out of us
naturally, or our hair grows

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.710
out of us naturally.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.550
Those are things that happen in
the due course of things.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.010
Nor are they against nature.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.600
They aren't like training
ourselves to be able to float

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.630
in the air, or to be able to
stay up for seventy-two weeks

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.130
at a time with no sleep, or to
do with no food for a decade.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.690
Those would be things that
are against nature.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.960
"Virtues of character arise in
us neither by nature nor

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.350
against nature.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:59.170
Rather, we are by nature
able to acquire them.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.290
They are things for which
we have the capacity.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:08.230
And they are completed
in us through habit."

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.000
So what does this process of
habituation look like?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.650
Well, Aristotle points out in
one of the most famous quotes

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:20.270
in the Nicomachean Ethics
that we learn to do

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.020
things by doing them.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.590
"We learn a craft," says
Aristotle, "by producing the

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.930
same product that we must
produce when we

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.490
have learned it.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.550
We learn to be a
builder"-- how?

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.776
By reading a book called
How to Build a House?

00:10:37.776 --> 00:10:40.870
I read something called "How
to Put Together a Table" by

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.050
IKEA, and it did not
result in a table.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:48.040
What resulted in a table was my
excellent twelve-year-old

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.220
son, who obviously is a builder
innately, coming and

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.122
showing me how to put
together the table.

00:10:53.122 --> 00:10:56.160
I thereby learned
to be a builder.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.925
I become a builder by

00:10:57.925 --> 00:11:00.026
practicing the art of building.

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:03.190
I become a harpist by
practicing the art

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.070
of playing the harp.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.070
How many of you play a
musical instrument?

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.180
How many of you learned to play
a musical instrument by

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.210
reading a book called, How to
Play the Piano, but never

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.430
touched any of the keyboard?

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.893
Zero?

00:11:18.893 --> 00:11:19.820
OK.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.600
How many of you learned to play
a musical instrument by

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.770
practicing the musical
instrument?

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.652
How many of you learned to
become a pianist or harpist or

00:11:27.652 --> 00:11:31.550
flautist by playing the piano
or harp or flute?

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.190
All right.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:37.752
So Aristotle's point is that the
way we become that which

00:11:37.752 --> 00:11:45.050
we hope to be is acting like
that was what we already were.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:50.600
In the same way as we learn to
play the piano by playing the

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.540
piano, we learn to be just
by doing just actions.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.900
We learn to be temperate by
acting in temperate ways.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.940
We learn to be brave by
doing brave actions.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:10.880
The way that we cultivate habits
is first by consciously

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.220
structuring our lives in such
a way that the habit that we

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.540
wish to cultivate becomes part
of our behavioral repertoire,

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:25.190
and then doing it over and over
again until it doesn't

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.410
require our concentration
anymore.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:34.200
It's exactly like any habitual
skill you have ever acquired

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.490
in the domain of music, in the
domain of sports, in any

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:45.170
domain where you have first
consciously, and subsequently

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:49.885
instinctively, learned to
practice a particular pattern

00:12:49.885 --> 00:12:56.215
of behavior, you have performed
the program that

00:12:56.215 --> 00:13:00.130
Aristotle describes for the
cultivation of virtue.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:05.440
So we'll come back to this again
in a couple of lectures.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.980
I want to conclude this section
by bringing out to you

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.590
one of the most famous parts of
the section of Aristotle's

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.075
discussion.

00:13:15.075 --> 00:13:19.025
So Aristotle points out that
there's a danger here.

00:13:19.025 --> 00:13:24.270
There's a danger to learning
to play the piano badly,

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.280
because the habits that you
cultivate when you keep your

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.985
fingers flat instead of curved
are habits that ingrain

00:13:31.985 --> 00:13:33.941
themselves in your behavior
in the same way

00:13:33.941 --> 00:13:35.100
that good habits do.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.435
It's not as if we have an
automatic filtering mechanism

00:13:38.435 --> 00:13:43.200
for practice that says, "oh,
when I practice, only the good

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.226
habits will stick, and the bad
habits won't." Whatever it is

00:13:48.226 --> 00:13:52.660
that you practice doing will
become habitual to you.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.740
These actions, these actions of
practicing what you aim to

00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:01.573
become, "are the sources and
causes both of the emergence

00:14:01.573 --> 00:14:09.420
and cause of virtue and of their
ruin." Practicing brave,

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.073
you'll become brave. Practice,
in the same context, being

00:14:13.073 --> 00:14:16.980
cowardly, and the cowardice will
instill itself in your

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.384
habitual behavior
in the same way.

00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:26.130
So, says Aristotle, for each
of these states, we need to

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:31.130
attend to the fact that it is
possible to do what we're

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:39.245
aiming for either too much or
too little, and aim for what

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:43.570
is famously called the
Aristotelian middle way.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:48.865
The virtues of Aristotle, she
says, tend to be ruined by

00:14:48.865 --> 00:14:52.600
excess and deficiency.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:58.440
So suppose you are confronted
with a risky situation.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.656
There are two false
extremes that you

00:15:01.656 --> 00:15:03.420
could be drawn towards.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:08.107
You could respond to it in a way
that is cowardly, or you

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:13.340
could respond to it in a
way that is reckless.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.890
Between these extremes,
says Aristotle, lies

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.130
the virtue of bravery.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:27.840
Suppose you are presented
with a social situation.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.750
You could respond to
it with hostility.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.264
You could respond to it
by being ingratiating.

00:15:34.264 --> 00:15:39.810
Between these, says Aristotle,
lies the virtue of

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.431
friendliness.

00:15:41.431 --> 00:15:44.910
Suppose you are confronted
with a situation where

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.290
something is being
asked of you.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.430
You could be stingy.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.670
You could be ostentatious
in what you do.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.435
Or you could be, in the
wonderful translation that we

00:15:54.435 --> 00:15:58.840
have in the Irwin,
"magnificent." That which lies

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.640
between stinginess and
ostentatiousness.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.400
Suppose you are studying for the
SAT and you're confronted

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.940
with a situation where
you can be either

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.110
pusillanimous--or vain.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.230
What would fall between them?

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.950
Between them falls the virtue
of magnanimity.

00:16:17.704 --> 00:16:20.516
Suppose you're confronted with
a situation where the

00:16:20.516 --> 00:16:24.660
possibility is to be either
self-deprecating or boastful.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.620
Neither is what's called for.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.850
What's called for is the
truthfulness that

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.270
lies between them.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.235
Suppose you're presented
with a joke.

00:16:33.235 --> 00:16:36.660
You can be either dour--or
buffoonish.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.270
Or instead, you can be witty.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.600
You might be quarrelsome.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.680
You might be ingratiating,
again, or, between them, you

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.526
might be friendly.

00:16:48.526 --> 00:16:48.950
Huh.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.650
There I have that twice.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.983
The general principle here is
that there are, with respect

00:16:54.983 --> 00:16:59.270
to each of the Aristotelian
virtues, two extremes.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:04.580
An extreme of deficiency and
an extreme of excess.

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:08.110
And between them lies what
is famously called the

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.075
Aristotelian mean.

00:17:10.075 --> 00:17:12.930
So you remember when I showed
you that famous Raphael

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.577
painting from the wall, "The
School of Athens," where Plato

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:19.886
is pointing to the sky,
referring to the forms, and

00:17:19.886 --> 00:17:22.310
Aristotle's hand is in
the middle of his

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.313
body, facing flat?

00:17:25.313 --> 00:17:28.260
And I said to you, there's two
ways that that has been

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.270
interpreted.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.630
One is with respect to
Aristotle's rejection of

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.215
Plato's idea of the forms, and
the second, I said, is that

00:17:36.215 --> 00:17:40.980
it's sometimes read as a sort
of embodied articulation of

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.302
Aristotle's idea of the mean.

00:17:43.302 --> 00:17:48.610
So here, for your pleasure, is
Aristotle's idea of the mean.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.170
Again, we'll come back to
this in two lectures.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:57.266
Let me close this section by
quoting for you Aristotle's

00:17:57.266 --> 00:18:00.990
picture of the virtuous circle
of habit formation.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.252
And right after this is when
we're going to need our

00:18:03.252 --> 00:18:05.745
clickers, so if you don't have
them out yet, you should take

00:18:05.745 --> 00:18:06.970
them out now.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.805
"Abstaining from pleasures,"
says Aristotle "makes us

00:18:10.805 --> 00:18:15.720
become temperate." And once we
have become temperate, we're

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.760
more capable of abstaining
from pleasure.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.940
It is similar with bravery.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.520
Habituation in standing firm
in frightening situations

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:30.450
makes us become brave. And once
we have become brave, we

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.340
are more capable of
standing firm.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:39.550
There is a circle to this kind
of practiced behavior.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.403
And what we will read three
classes from now is a

00:18:43.403 --> 00:18:46.870
contemporary articulation of
this idea in the form of

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.050
something called cognitive
behavioral therapy.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:50.840
OK.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.330
So that closes what
we were taking

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.460
from last week's lecture.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:00.290
And what I want to open with
and cover in the last

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.645
twenty-five minutes or
so that we have is

00:19:02.645 --> 00:19:05.430
the topic for today.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.674
So let me just give you the
punch line right now.

00:19:09.674 --> 00:19:12.420
The punch line is this.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.040
You remember from the opening
pages of book two of Plato's

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.330
Republic that the character
Glaucon poses a challenge to

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:27.480
Plato's character Socrates in
the form of the claim that

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:33.562
behaving justly, behaving in
accord with one's reflective

00:19:33.562 --> 00:19:38.900
commitment, behaving in accord
with the norms of morality, is

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:43.520
something that we do only for
instrumental reasons.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:51.320
There is nothing intrinsically
valuable to the ordered soul.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:58.020
Today's lecture is about
two incredible stories.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:03.030
One, the Iliad and the Vietnam
war, as read through the

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:07.120
writings of Jonathan Shay,
two, the experiments of

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.990
Stanley Milgram, done here on
this campus in the 1960s, both

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:19.027
of which give us a window into
what human experience looks

00:20:19.027 --> 00:20:25.250
like in Glaucon's dream world.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:30.300
Glaucon said: What we want is to
be able to run wild with no

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.540
consequences to our actions.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:37.630
What we want is to be able to
violate the norms of morality.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:41.620
Given the chance, anybody
would do that.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:46.552
The stories that Shay and
Milgram tell us, the

00:20:46.552 --> 00:20:50.857
descriptions they give of what
human experience is like in

00:20:50.857 --> 00:20:57.300
these moments where the soul
runs amok, suggests that maybe

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.012
Glaucon is wrong.

00:21:00.012 --> 00:21:07.120
It suggests that for whatever
reason, there appears to be,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.530
at least in these domains, a
need on the part of human

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:16.360
beings for a certain kind
of structure and order.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.910
And in the absence of that kind
of structure and order,

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.380
the world seems to fall apart.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.447
What I want to start by doing
in this lecture, however, is

00:21:26.447 --> 00:21:30.700
by pointing out to you what an
unusual time you live in.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.455
So could you answer
this question?

00:21:33.455 --> 00:21:37.924
Press one if you have served
in the military, two if you

00:21:37.924 --> 00:21:40.900
have not served in the military
but you plan or

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.070
expect to serve in the military,
and three, if you

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.265
have not served in the military,
and you do not plan

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:49.000
or expect to serve.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.020
So one if you have been in the
military, either in the U.S.,

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.200
or some other country of which
you're a citizen, two if your

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.261
plan is at some point in the
near future, to enroll in

00:22:00.261 --> 00:22:03.460
active military service,
and three, if you have

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.560
no plans to do so.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.500
OK.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.730
So let's take a, the
numbers on this--

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.640
OK.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:16.754
So it looks like 1% of you have
served in the military.

00:22:16.754 --> 00:22:23.502
5% of you have the plan to do
so, and 94% of you have no

00:22:23.502 --> 00:22:26.450
expectations that military
service is something that you

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:27.950
will ever do.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.485
Next question.

00:22:29.485 --> 00:22:32.880
Think of the person you know
to whom you are closest who

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.560
served in the military, and
let me know whether that's

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.632
somebody extremely close, a
sibling or a best friend.

00:22:39.632 --> 00:22:41.716
If so, push one.

00:22:41.716 --> 00:22:44.640
Somebody relatively close, like
your first cousin or a

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.826
school buddy, somebody that you
are on a team with, that

00:22:46.826 --> 00:22:48.780
you feel relatively close to.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.790
Or three if the closest person
you know who served in the

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.985
military is like a kid from your
school, or a neighbor, or

00:22:54.985 --> 00:22:57.370
somebody that you don't
know very well.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.708
And let's see how the numbers
come out on this.

00:23:00.708 --> 00:23:03.600
OK.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.542
So almost none of you have a
sibling or best friend who is

00:23:09.542 --> 00:23:11.230
in the military.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:15.204
Roughly half of you know
somebody reasonably well who

00:23:15.204 --> 00:23:19.940
is in service, and fully a third
of you have no one in

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.680
your immediate social
circle who has

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.456
performed military service.

00:23:26.456 --> 00:23:28.951
Let's go back a generation.

00:23:28.951 --> 00:23:30.450
I'm asking you about your
father because we

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.747
need a one to one.

00:23:31.747 --> 00:23:34.613
If I ask you about both parents,
we'd be doubling the

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:35.660
sampling set.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.702
So of your father, please answer
one if he served in the

00:23:38.702 --> 00:23:40.060
military, two if he didn't.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:57.373
OK.

00:23:57.373 --> 00:24:00.900
And let's look at the
numbers here.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.800
So you look different
from your father.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.690
About 5% of you have served
or are planning to

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:07.890
serve in the military.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.725
About 20% of your fathers did.

00:24:09.725 --> 00:24:12.400
Let's go back another
generation.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.520
Paternal grandfather, again,
because we need one person.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.180
One if he served in the
military, two if he did not.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.120
Paternal grandfather.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.240
That's your father's father.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.570
Did he serve in the military?

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.591
OK.

00:24:40.591 --> 00:24:45.190
54% of your grandfathers
served in the military.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:49.720
So we went from 4% in your
generation, 20% in your

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:56.650
father's generation, 55% in your
grandfather's generation.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:02.182
You are living in an
extraordinarily unusual time.

00:25:02.182 --> 00:25:07.300
The social distance between
American elite universities

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.740
and the U.S. military is greater
now than it has ever

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:17.174
been in the 200 years of
this country's history.

00:25:17.174 --> 00:25:22.970
And the architecture that
surrounds you gives lived

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:28.690
voice to the way in which your
experience is unusual.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.410
How many of you recognize
this building?

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.760
It's about twenty
feet from here.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.650
Every single hand in this
room should be going up.

00:25:39.877 --> 00:25:44.340
How many of you have looked
closely at what that is?

00:25:47.434 --> 00:25:50.486
So this building, as some of you
know, those of you who are

00:25:50.486 --> 00:25:54.980
Yale tour guides certainly
know, is Memorial Hall.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:26:01.088
It was built in 1901 without
this facade here.

00:26:01.088 --> 00:26:05.985
And at the conclusion of the
First World War, during which

00:26:05.985 --> 00:26:13.550
a huge number of Yale associates
died, this addition

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:16.550
was constructed.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:21.570
Across the top are the names of
battles of the First World

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:26.711
War at which Yale men died.

00:26:26.711 --> 00:26:32.517
And down below is an empty
coffin, "In Memory of the Men

00:26:32.517 --> 00:26:35.995
of Yale who true to Her
Traditions gave their Lives

00:26:35.995 --> 00:26:41.040
that Freedom might not perish
from the Earth."

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:47.750
Yale's relation to World War
I was an extraordinary one.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:52.785
Here's a passage from a speech
given by Henry Simpson at the

00:26:52.785 --> 00:26:54.950
dedication of the war
memorials that

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:57.000
I just showed you.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.555
"After our entry into the war,
and a wide adoption by the

00:27:00.555 --> 00:27:03.350
government of the principle
of universal service, Yale

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:07.370
gradually became a military
training camp and a completely

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.420
militarized university.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.071
Her faculties and laboratories
turned their resources

00:27:13.071 --> 00:27:17.210
entirely over to the arts of
war, and nearly all of her

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.700
remaining scholars became
student members of the

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.960
Organized Military Forces
of the United States.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.710
Yale maintained one
of the foremost

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.980
artillery schools in America.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.490
She carried on a large naval
training unit, commissioned

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.210
officers for the Navy.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.585
She trained officers for
the signal corps.

00:27:34.585 --> 00:27:36.660
Her chemists conducted resources
for the chemical

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.950
warfare service.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.520
Doctors and assistants were
prepared there for the army

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.230
hospitals, and a complete army
hospital unit was maintained

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.890
by the University in France.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:51.290
Practically the entire momentum
of this institution

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.470
of learning was thrown
effectively into the scales of

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:56.430
war."

00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:01.820
The relation between elite
universities and the military

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:06.625
doing both the First and
Second World Wars was

00:28:06.625 --> 00:28:10.164
strikingly different than
anything any of you have

00:28:10.164 --> 00:28:12.808
encountered now.

00:28:12.808 --> 00:28:18.150
And in an effort to memorialize
the contributions

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:22.790
to the war effort made by the
men of Yale, it was decided

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:27.850
that along the interior walls
of Memorial Hall would be

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.510
engraved plaques.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:35.580
So if you walk in on your way to
commons, on your right hand

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.937
side as you enter, you see the
names of Yale men who died in

00:28:39.937 --> 00:28:43.000
the revolutionary war.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.520
And on the two sides that you
pass, those who died on either

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.902
side in the Civil War, the names
of those who died in the

00:28:52.902 --> 00:28:57.930
Spanish-American War, the 227
names of those who died in the

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:03.510
first World War, the 514 names
of those who died in the

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:09.270
second World War, the 22 names
of those who died in the

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:14.520
Korean War, and the 37 names
of those who died in the

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.240
Vietnam War.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:21.950
Now, the question of why the
relation between elite

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:27.380
institutions and the military
came to be what it is today is

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:33.180
one whose answer depends upon
a number of these incredibly

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:37.180
important and complicated facts
about U.S. history.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:42.960
Suffice it to say that it was
the view of the majority of

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:47.120
Yale students and a good
proportion of Yale faculty

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.770
that the war in Vietnam well
was an unjust war.

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:55.680
And it was for that reason
that there was an

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.666
unwillingness on the part of
many of them to serve, and

00:29:58.666 --> 00:30:04.716
indeed, a brave expression of
opposition on the part of some

00:30:04.716 --> 00:30:09.560
of them that had direct
consequences in their lives.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:14.600
But the attitude of the Yale
campus towards the Vietnam War

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:22.010
is perhaps best captured by
this image of protesters

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:27.830
co-opting this image of
something used for

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:31.810
commemoration of those who
fought in a just war, and

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:36.140
using it as a way off expressing
their views that

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:40.380
the particular war they
confronted in Vietnam was an

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.140
unjust one.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.920
For those of you who have not
yet been convinced that

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:50.969
philosophy is something that
matters: this was a

00:30:50.969 --> 00:30:54.199
philosophical debate
about the nature of

00:30:54.199 --> 00:30:55.521
what justice permits.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:03.040
Regardless of whether Yale
students went to fight in the

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:08.750
Vietnam War, a huge number of
other citizens of the United

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:12.650
States went to fight
in the Vietnam War.

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:18.219
And the work which we read for
today by Jonathan Shay is an

00:31:18.219 --> 00:31:24.600
incredibly powerful reading
of their experience that

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:31.000
juxtaposes for you quotations
from the great ancient

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.336
description of the subjective
experience of war--the

00:31:35.336 --> 00:31:38.443
founding text, in many ways,
of the Western literary

00:31:38.443 --> 00:31:44.510
tradition, Homer's IIliad --and
the in-their-own-voice

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:48.590
experience of the Vietnam
veterans with whom Jonathan

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:57.070
Shay worked in an effort to help
them deal with the stress

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:01.390
and the trauma that the war
experience produced in them.

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:06.150
And Shay's thesis in this book,
as you know, is that

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:11.020
when a leader destroys the
legitimacy of the army's moral

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:16.410
order by betraying what he calls
themis, what right, the

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:20.490
order of things, the structure
by which we can understand the

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:27.800
world as predictable and
well-ordered--in so doing,

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.880
injuries are inflicted on
the soldiers that are

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.210
not physical injuries.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:39.510
They are what Shay calls
moral injuries.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:45.560
And these moral injuries arise,
he suggests, both in

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.920
the Iliad, where Homer describes
the immediate and

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.170
devastating consequences on
Achilles, first of the feeling

00:32:54.170 --> 00:33:00.504
of injustice at having had his
war prize taken away from him,

00:33:00.504 --> 00:33:05.540
and then through what Shay calls
the berserk behavior

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.960
that results as the consequence
of the death of

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.280
his friend Patroclus.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:17.993
Now let me pause and say that
in talking about this, we're

00:33:17.993 --> 00:33:22.670
glossing over many, many things
that are problematic

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:24.700
about that story.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.962
What is it that Achilles
is upset about?

00:33:26.962 --> 00:33:31.820
He's upset about the woman who
was given to him as a prize

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.620
for battle being taken
away from him and

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.986
given to another man.

00:33:36.986 --> 00:33:41.945
I take it that, for most of you,
your conception of what

00:33:41.945 --> 00:33:45.174
the moral order permits
does not include war

00:33:45.174 --> 00:33:47.750
prizes of that form.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.555
And we'll talk more about
that when we get

00:33:51.555 --> 00:33:52.960
to the ethics section.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.540
How do we make sense of moral
standards that are treated as

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.942
legitimate in one domain,
and not in the other?

00:34:01.942 --> 00:34:04.270
But for the time being, I would
like you to bracket

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.360
here, as we bracketed in the
context of most of the ancient

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.310
texts that we've been reading,
that which you find

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:17.614
unfamiliar, and focus instead
on what you find familiar.

00:34:17.614 --> 00:34:20.450
The description of Achilles'
experience is

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:22.170
one that rings true.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.500
And it rings true in the same
way that the description of

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.720
the Vietnam soldier's experience
rings true.

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:34.098
Shay points out that just as
the Iliad is a story of the

00:34:34.098 --> 00:34:37.610
devastating consequences for
Achilles and the other

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:41.430
soldiers, so, too, are the
narratives that the Vietnam

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:46.712
soldiers provide an instance of
something that forces us to

00:34:46.712 --> 00:34:50.420
see that the consequences go
beyond, and here's a quote

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:54.440
from the Iliad, "the war's loss
upon bitter loss, leaving

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.100
so many dead men," --that the
consequence is to taint the

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:02.620
lives of those who survive it.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:07.760
One of the greatest harms that
the Vietnam War appears to

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.510
have done to a good portion
of those who served there,

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:16.706
whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, is to have

00:35:16.706 --> 00:35:20.740
produced in them a set
of symptoms that some

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:25.415
psychiatrists find helpful to
describe as post-traumatic

00:35:25.415 --> 00:35:27.154
stress disorder.

00:35:27.154 --> 00:35:32.250
And these are symptoms that
affect the soldiers, the

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:36.410
survivors of trauma,
in three domains.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:40.424
They affect their actions in the
world, they affect their

00:35:40.424 --> 00:35:43.770
perceptions of the world, and
they affect their social

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:45.690
experiences.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:49.206
So one of the symptoms of
post-traumatic stress disorder

00:35:49.206 --> 00:35:52.480
is "a persistent mobilization
of the body and mind toward

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.650
lethal danger, a potential for
explosive violence, as the

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:59.420
result of being constantly on
alert." All of you know the

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.980
experience of being in full
focus when you feel yourself

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.330
to be in danger.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:08.340
It's something that occupies
a huge percentage

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.290
of the body's resources.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:15.090
Everything goes on focusing on
being hair-trigger responses.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:17.240
And you can have this in
all sorts of domains.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.950
You can have it if you're
engaged in video game which

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.583
requires you to do an incredibly
quick response, or

00:36:22.583 --> 00:36:25.935
if you feel yourself in some
kind of threat situation: But

00:36:25.935 --> 00:36:32.025
it's in a full-body experience
of being related to the world

00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:33.900
in a particular way.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:41.870
Now imagine being on alert
in that way all the time.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:47.450
One consequence of being on
alert in that way is that one

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:52.380
perceives things in the most
negative light possible.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:57.100
If you are what's sometimes
called risk-averse, then you

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:01.463
are going to, for each encounter
you have, entertain

00:37:01.463 --> 00:37:04.230
the possibility that what
you confront is

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.680
the worst-case scenario.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:11.432
And soldiers who are suffering
from post-traumatic stress

00:37:11.432 --> 00:37:16.398
disorder perceive those things
around them through the

00:37:16.398 --> 00:37:19.460
heightened attentional
mechanisms that come with this

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:27.025
hair-trigger action, and view
them as potential dangers.

00:37:27.025 --> 00:37:30.370
And the things that they pursue
as potential dangers

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:36.530
are not merely mundane objects
in the world, like an object

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:40.940
lying on a table that might
ambiguously be either a gun or

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:47.162
an innocent piece of cardboard,
but also in their

00:37:47.162 --> 00:37:48.930
social interactions.

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.837
And perhaps the greatest cost,
and we'll see why this is such

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:56.540
a cost in Thursday afternoon's
lecture, perhaps the greatest

00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:02.352
cost is the loss of the
possibility of social trust.

00:38:02.352 --> 00:38:05.430
And I want to point out to you
the way in which this can

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:09.490
happen to cultures as a whole.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:14.440
Communities that find themselves
subject to certain

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:19.455
kinds of terrorist or guerrilla
warfare by those who

00:38:19.455 --> 00:38:26.160
are opposed to them lose the
capacity to behave humanely

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.980
towards those with whom
they struggle.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:35.900
If your opponent's strategy is
to bring bombs into your

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:43.800
country using ambulances, then
you will be forced to treat

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.630
ambulances as suspicious
objects.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:52.440
If, as Shay describes in
Achilles in Vietnam, a common

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:58.890
strategy is to put a baby atop a
pile of explosives, then you

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:04.842
will be forced, through your
enemy's actions, not to help a

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:07.140
needing child.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:11.425
Robbing your enemy of this
capacity to behave humanely to

00:39:11.425 --> 00:39:17.370
you is a strategy that
produces a cycle

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:19.960
of incredible disorder.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.860
Because, of course, it's only
a feeling of being cornered

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:28.195
with nothing else to do that
would lead somebody to take

00:39:28.195 --> 00:39:32.555
the strategy of using
ambulances to carry

00:39:32.555 --> 00:39:34.760
bombs and so on.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:40.790
The orderliness that governs
conventional warfare is a

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:44.220
reflection of a certain kind
of psychological need.

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.811
And the disorderliness that is
typical of nonconventional

00:39:48.811 --> 00:39:52.950
warfare, of which Vietnam is an
example and terrorism is a

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:56.586
second, is something that you
produces in societies as a

00:39:56.586 --> 00:40:00.320
whole some kind of approximation
of the

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.270
post-traumatic stress
disorder that Shay

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.956
identifies in the soldier.

00:40:05.956 --> 00:40:09.360
So what I want to do now, in the
last five minutes of the

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:14.174
lecture, is to give you two
examples from Shay of the

00:40:14.174 --> 00:40:16.454
phenomenon that he's describing,
and then connect

00:40:16.454 --> 00:40:19.680
it back to Glaucon's
challenge.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:26.290
So the Iliad is a tale
of mania, of anger.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:30.610
And the opening passage, which
Shay cites, from book one of

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:34.880
which I had you read for today,
is an expression of the

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:39.350
indignant rage felt by Achilles
at the betrayal of

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:41.200
the rules of honor of warfare.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.800
And Achilles says--

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.990
this is actually a quote from
book sixteen, but it's talking

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.200
about the earlier moment.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.050
"Only this bitterness eats at
my heart when one man has

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:54.152
deprived and shamed his
equal, taking back his

00:40:54.152 --> 00:40:56.727
prize by abuse of power.

00:40:56.727 --> 00:40:59.403
The girl whom the Akhaians
chose for me I

00:40:59.403 --> 00:41:02.222
won by my own spear.

00:41:02.222 --> 00:41:06.464
A town with walls I stormed
and sacked for her, then

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:10.333
Agamemnon stole her back out
of my hands as though I was

00:41:10.333 --> 00:41:13.050
some vagabond held cheap."

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.950
It's a violation of
the honor code.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:20.740
It's a violation of the rules
and expectations with which

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:24.474
Achilles entered this war. "A
town with walls I stormed and

00:41:24.474 --> 00:41:26.920
sacked for her.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:30.960
I am deprived of her not by the
rules of war but by abuse

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:35.520
of power." Here's a soldier in
Vietnam expressing much the

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.470
same thing.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:37.550
"Walking point"--

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:42.505
which is a job that involves
basically being placed in the

00:41:42.505 --> 00:41:45.425
line of soldiers that's most
likely to lead to your being

00:41:45.425 --> 00:41:47.180
killed through an explosive--

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.482
"Walking point was an extremely
dangerous job.

00:41:50.482 --> 00:41:53.720
The decision of who was going to
do it was made not fairly.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.680
It was made politically.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.610
Certain people got the shift.

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:58.454
Certain people didn't.

00:41:58.454 --> 00:42:01.180
Certain people on the right
side of certain people."

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:04.402
And this idea that the
distribution of dangers

00:42:04.402 --> 00:42:09.420
doesn't track rules, it tracks
whims, is disordering.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.320
So the result of this, and I
talked about this in the last

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.280
slide already, is a kind of loss
of trust, a recognition

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.160
that ordinary objects-- that's
the story of the baby on the

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.700
mine --holds a potential for
danger, nothing is what it

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.918
seems, all certainties
liquefy.

00:42:27.918 --> 00:42:32.970
And the second discovery that
Vietnam soldiers found

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:36.230
themselves making was something
that we'll discuss

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:41.285
in the context of a paper that
we'll read called "Moral

00:42:41.285 --> 00:42:46.153
Luck." A discovery of what
one is capable of in

00:42:46.153 --> 00:42:47.120
circumstances.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.060
Here's the veteran: "It's
unbelievable what humans can

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.155
do to each other.

00:42:51.155 --> 00:42:53.700
I never, in a million year,
thought I would be capable of

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.940
doing that.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.275
Never, never, never."

00:42:57.275 --> 00:43:05.100
So here's Shay's, here's Homer's
answer to Glaucon.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:09.030
Dear Glaucon, Please note.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:13.770
The concern that these soldiers
are expressing is not

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:16.496
about what they seem to be.

00:43:16.496 --> 00:43:19.530
It's not about what they are
perceived to have done.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.080
Indeed, one of their complaints
is that when they

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.670
come home, no one will listen
to their stories.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:31.630
The concerns of these soldiers
is about what they have done,

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:34.680
about the being and
not the seeming.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:39.789
And it is the being, what you
are, what is intrinsically the

00:43:39.789 --> 00:43:44.430
case, that is of concern
to them.

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:47.990
So we'll take up this issue at
the beginning of next lecture

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.060
with the discussion of the
Milgram, and then we'll turn

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:55.068
to the readings from Epictetus
and the contemporary

00:43:55.068 --> 00:43:56.318
analogues of it.
